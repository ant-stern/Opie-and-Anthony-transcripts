<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about the inferior sound quality of their satellite radio microphones compared to traditional radio mics, using a vulgar analogy.  This transitioned into Anthony recounting a hands-free bike ride in Central Park, which amazed onlookers, especially his ability to turn.  This led to a discussion about the seemingly inexplicable fascination of (primarily white) people with photographing squirrels in Central Park, prompting speculation about their origins and a listener call confirming the existence of black squirrels from Eastern Europe.  Anthony then shared anecdotes about fatherhood, specifically methods of tiring out his young son.  This segued into a lengthy, sexually explicit discussion comparing the appeal of oral sex with Buck Angel and Bailey Jay, referencing Ricky Gervais's since-deleted tweet on the same topic.  Anthony further detailed a personal experience unknowingly having sex with a person with a penis, followed by reminiscences about his encounters with sex workers in New Jersey and the gentrification of a formerly seedy NYC area. A trip to Washington D.C. was recounted, including a humorous description of Kenny's awkward experiences on the DC subway. The segment concluded with a discussion of Anthony's poor sleep, a graphic recounting of President Lincoln's assassination, Civil War-era medical practices (including amputations), a Hulk Hogan video at Flyers hockey games, and a brief mention of a Tupac performance.  The show ended with a humorous exchange about the hosts' need for love, a short comedic song about the Pope, and some Bo Diddley music.

The next segment opened with a comparison of Buddy Holly's and the Grateful Dead's versions of "Not Fade Away," including critiques of their musical styles.  The hosts then played and dissected Grateful Dead songs, focusing on their extended jams, particularly "Drums in Space."  Celebrity birthdays (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Belichick) and the anniversary of Michael Jordan's final NBA game were mentioned, followed by a humorous recreation of the Gatorade commercial.  The conversation moved to Coachella, specifically Snoop Dogg's performance with a holographic Tupac (costing $10 million), comparing its size to Bonnaroo and discussing other performers. A video of the Tupac hologram was played.  Biggie Smalls and Tupac were discussed, along with anecdotes about their music.  The New York Yankees were mentioned, focusing on Jorge Posada's first pitch and Tim Tebow's booing, featuring an audio clip of John Sterling's enthusiastic home run call.  The induction of Guns N' Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the Beastie Boys into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was discussed, including Izzy Stradlin's absence and appearance.  Bill Cosby's comments on the Trayvon Martin case and a listener's personal anecdote about Cosby were briefly covered. A listener called in to correct the hosts' misinformation about a Guns N' Roses tour.  The segment concluded with an interview with UFC fighter Rashad Evans, covering his upcoming fight against Jon Jones, their past relationship, the rivalry, other UFC events (including Brock Lesnar's return and Anderson Silva's beatable status), and a rumor about Jon Jones and Rashad Evans' ex-wife.  Rashad also discussed managing fear and anxiety in fighting.

A further segment featured a longer in-studio interview with Rashad Evans, five days before his fight with Jon Jones.  The discussion covered his physical and mental preparation for the fight (including the sex-before-a-fight myth), previous injuries, and the pressure of championship bouts.  Rashad shared anecdotes from his time as a hospital security guard, including emotionally disturbing experiences with deceased individuals, particularly a man shot three times over three weeks and a Level 3 trauma patient who died from internal bleeding.  The conversation compared Rashad's humility to Jon Jones' cockiness, discussed the intimidating energy of some fighters during stare-downs (mentioning Machida), and Rashad's admission to partying harder after losses than wins.  Relationships and emotional situations affecting fighters were discussed, along with anecdotes about fighters' struggles with girlfriends post-fight. The significance of stare-downs and sensing a fighter's energy were debated. The hosts playfully exchanged punches with Rashad and joked about his experiences with a childhood bully, “Uncle Billy.”  The segment concluded with promotion of the upcoming fight and further discussion of the Trayvon Martin case.

The final segment focused heavily on the George Zimmerman trial, speculating on legal aspects, self-defense claims, plea bargains, and Florida's "stand your ground" law. A caller recounted a similar self-defense shooting incident involving his wife. A bizarre public service announcement promoting condom use among senior citizens was played and commented upon. The Secret Service prostitution scandal in Colombia was discussed. A significant portion involved Jim Norton's altercation with Rashad Evans, focusing on the punch's force and Norton's enjoyment of the pain.  Norton discussed his living situation and interactions with his building's doormen.  Jim Norton's experience with Apple stock options (puts and calls) and his recent losses were detailed. The segment concluded with a discussion of the show's staff's financial treatment and the hosts' frustration with management over hotel accommodations for upcoming shows. A listener call and studio guest appearance by Kenny concluded the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Oh yes!  Oh yeah!  We should do a montage of the first things we say when these mics go on.  Oh, that would be funny.  Because even after all these years, it's just dumb little noises.  Noises! It really is!  Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!  You know what it is? Because I still have not gotten used to what this sounds like. 
[00:00:30]  Right.  On regular radio, they can tweak it and it's like soft.  It's like a warm pussy when you talk.  This has been... On satellite radio, it's harsh still.  That part of this technology, they just don't have figured out.  I'm sure it sounds good out there. I'd listen to the replay and all.  But how it sounds in my ears...  It's different than regular radio, yeah.  To this day. So I think it's...  You kind of... 
[00:01:00]  You gotta feel it out.  You're feeling it out.  Get some blows.  Get some highs.  I was thinking about that the other day.  Every time we turn on the mics, we just...  Ah!  I don't hear all the broadcasters do that.  They get right into it.  Welcome, welcome. I got welcome, welcome this morning, by the way.  Just for those of you keeping tabs.  Welcome, welcome.  Welcome. Welcome, welcome.  And I just turned to him and I went...  I pointed my finger at him and I went,  There he is!  You start taping this shit. 
[00:01:30]  I know.  It drives me nuts when people don't take cool shit.  Tape it.  There he is.  What does that even mean?  It's awful.  Ah!  Cha-cha-cha.  Terrible.  I did the double gun thing.  Do you? Pew-pew!  This weekend I did.  Oh!  Because when I'm bored, I go around Central Park hands-free on my bike.  What?  To the amazement of way too many people, by the way.  What?  You just ride with no hands?  Yeah.  Even slow?  No, I go pretty fast.  Yeah, you gotta go keep that fucking wheel spinning. 
[00:02:00]  But I'm not...  I swear to you, I'm not bragging, because I just assume most people could do that.  But the looks I get from people, I'm like, seriously?  You think this is amazing?  Why do you think this is amazing?  Do you turn?  Huh?  Do you turn with no hands?  I do.  I do, yeah.  Kind of just lean.  Just a slight lean.  Boy, you don't do that with the kid on the back, do you?  I have.  Oh!  You're a maniac.  And I'm not just saying this for the radio.  I have.  I have, yes.  Yes.  My wife thinks I go for a nice little ride in the park with my son.  Because I got the bike seat. 
[00:02:30]  I never slow down.  Yeah.  Everyone thought when I would have a kid, I would, like, slow my biking down.  No, man.  He's strapped in and holding on for dear life.  Wearing a fucking NASCAR fire suit and shit and a helmet.  Right.  But I did the double gun thing to these people, because they were so amazed that I was just  on my bike with no hands.  I went...  You gotta...  I wasn't going to talk about this, but really fast.  Oh, really fast.  You're going to spill your coffee all over your hands. 
[00:03:00]  I'll do this.  Cha-cha.  Oh, Jim.  I want to know where these people are from in Central Park.  Maybe someone can answer this question.  That they have to take pictures of squirrels.  Is that a big thing going on?  I know this is a very strange way to start a radio show.  Is that a big thing that's going on?  They love taking pictures of squirrels in Central Park.  They are adorable.  But aren't squirrels squirrels?  Well, yeah.  And aren't they everywhere?  Yeah.  I would think your average gray squirrel kind of is everywhere. 
[00:03:30]  So where are these people from that they're amazed by a squirrel?  They gotta take a picture of it.  I don't get it.  Maybe there are some faraway lands where squirrels don't run around free like they do in the park.  I was somewhere where...  Are they Asian?  No.  Are they Negroid?  No.  Are they Hispanic?  They're white.  White?  They're white.  It's crazy.  They are white.  I remember being somewhere where the squirrels were black.  Oh.  Where is that?  Africa. 
[00:04:00]  Africa.  I have no idea.  Maybe it was on the west coast or something?  Yeah?  There's another part of the country where the squirrels are black.  But in general, wherever I go, I see the same fucking squirrel.  Same squirrel.  And these people in Central Park have to take pictures of them.  So I'm like, where the fuck are you from that you're amazed by a squirrel?  That's fucking...  Maybe Europe?  Europe have squirrels?  Europe's gotta have squirrels.  Yeah.  I would think.  Although I don't think I've ever seen one in a film clip of Europe.  I don't think I've ever seen, you know, where they were tearing down the Berlin Wall 
[00:04:30]  and a little squirrel was running on top of the wall.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  Dumb way to start a week of radio, I understand.  But it happened yesterday.  I just need to know, why are they amazed by the squirrels?  One guy was setting up like a tripod and everything.  Oh, like...  It wasn't even like just a camera phone.  He was obsessed with taking a picture of the squirrels.  Pro-rig.  I don't know.  No, pro-rig, right.  Maybe it was an assignment.  Can you tell I was bored this weekend?  Oh, man. 
[00:05:00]  Riding bikes with no hands and looking at a squirrel.  Holy fuck.  Getting their picture taken.  I had to babysit the kid the entire weekend.  It's not babysitting if it's...  No, it was babysitting.  The entire weekend.  I went to like 10 playgrounds with him, I think.  I get on my bike and we go to different playgrounds.  What, do you just try to tire him out?  Oh, yeah.  That's the key.  Very good, Jimmy.  You'd be a good parent.  You just got to get them tired.  You got to tire them the fuck out.  Yeah, whatever they want to do.  I want to jump.  Go ahead.  Jump up and down a lot.  Go ahead. 
[00:05:30]  He's all about walking now.  I mean, he's been walking for a year, but I mean really walking.  So I'm like, yeah, go ahead.  You can walk a few city blocks with me.  No problem.  Knowing his legs are much tinier.  So that's got to be...  Each block has to be like a mile to me and you.  So I figure a couple of those will knock him down.  Yeah.  And it does.  Knock him down.  You got to knock him down, man.  Do you like when he's wiped out at the end of the day?  It's the best feeling ever.  When he starts yawning?  Well, it starts with just like, you know, he loses his fucking mind because he doesn't 
[00:06:00]  understand what being really tired is and then tries to force himself to stay awake.  Oh, his eyes like spinning around his head?  Yeah.  And then he's a little louder and whinier.  Does he get cranky when he's tired?  Oh, God.  Like everyone does.  But on a kid, it's like 10 times worse.  Like daddy.  Exactly.  We want together.  We're!  My bosses suck! 
[00:06:30]  Black squirrel info.  And there are no squirrels in Australia, so they might be Australians.  No?  But they got some other pretty cool shit where they would just go, fuck the squirrels.  We got like kangaroos.  I bet you.  We got a wallaby.  I bet you it's like us fucking taking pictures of the kangaroos.  I hear they're not that special in Australia.  In Australia?  I hear they're fucking just rats, right?  Yeah.  I hear they're on the side of the road and shit.  Yeah, like roadkill kangaroo.  People just are completely annoyed by fucking kangaroos.  Yeah.  I would like that, though. 
[00:07:00]  Would be kind of fucking cool.  A whole park filled with kangaroos instead of squirrels?  Yeah.  Squirrels?  Why?  People, I don't care about your squirrel facts, people.  Why?  I don't know.  I need to know where the squirrels are, and I need to know where the fucking black squirrels  are.  Let me, just humor me for two more seconds.  John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey, John.  Hey.  Hey.  You're black squirrels.  Yeah.  They originated in Eastern Europe, a professor of zoology at Kent State University up in  Ohio, bought some over, bred them, and now they are all over the campus up in Northeastern 
[00:07:30]  Ohio.  Black squirrels in Ohio?  We're going to Cleveland.  Oh, they look cool as fuck, though.  You've never seen a black squirrel?  Look at that little guy.  Go to Kent State University.  I want to scratch him under his chin.  I want to scratch him under his chin.  Shooka, shooka, shooka.  See, now I'm the dummy.  I would fucking take a picture of the black squirrel.  Yeah, yeah.  So I guess, you know, these people aren't too far off.  But I need to know in America, it wasn't Ohio, man.  I saw black squirrels, but whatever.  We could do this all day. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you, sir.  And Lee in Atlanta.  No squirrels in Australia.  Go ahead, bro.  Hey, yeah, we got this Australian chick that we hired in the office, and we asked her what  was so fascinating about America.  First words out of her mouth.  We don't have any squirrels in Australia.  I love squirrels.  I told you.  See?  I told you.  It could be.  They're white.  Right.  They're, you know, they look European.  Right.  Or Australians.  All right.  I bet if you went up and said, what are you doing? 
[00:08:30]  I'm taking pitches?  I'm a fan of squirrel.  Gonna take a few shorts here?  You'd be like, oh, okay.  He must be Australian.  Is this true?  Why would you do this?  Oh, yeah.  And you want to read this one?  Stop.  You want to read this one?  The testosterone-charged black squirrel is fitter, faster, and more fiercely competitive  than both reds or grays.  See, they got an extra thigh muscle.  You see, the black squirrel's been bred to be the better athlete. 
[00:09:00]  They could get those nuts better than the white squirrel.  But the white, actually, the gray squirrels, they invent everything.  Oh, see, because I don't know what that means.  Well.  So there you go.  Get my camera.  Take a few pitches.  Of course, they're saying black squirrels in the Bronx.  Oh, yeah, well.  See, the racist angle.  Aren't squirrels mean? 
[00:09:30]  Aren't squirrels mean?  Yeah, they can be pretty fucking mean.  Remember Bernie Gatsch love squirrels?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He had, like, a baby squirrel that he raised, and it's his pet.  They're skittish, though, squirrels.  Of course they are.  So they're never going to really fuck you up, because they're too scared.  I don't know.  I think they do those quick strikes.  Like, they would jump on your face.  Like, their hands would be moving so fast, you couldn't even see them as they claw you,  and then they're gone.  Like, twitching their little tails.  Twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch.  See, I told you we'd make something of this. 
[00:10:00]  I just knew we would.  They're adorable.  They're fucking assholes.  Yeah, they are assholes.  So they attack really quickly, and then they squirmish?  Yeah, yeah.  Frrrt, frrrt, twitch, twitch, twitch, twitch, tail.  Twit, twitch, twitch, frrrt, twitch, twitch.  I know the frrrt.  Yeah.  Their hands are moving so fucking fast.  How do they get their hands to move that fast?  I don't know.  It's pretty crazy.  God, if it wasn't for these brains we got, we would really suck in nature.  That would be done-ski.  Because animals are so much fucking faster and better at doing just basic shit. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, they are.  But, boy, these thumbs, they come in handy.  Is it all about the dumb?  Try turning a screw, you little bastard.  All about the dumb?  It's all about the thumbs.  It's all about the thumbs.  Thumbs.  That opposable thumb.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Without that thing, we'd be walking around going,  I can't even pick up a quarter.  LA's got the black squirrels.  Where are the black squirrels, Fezzy?  Whatever.  How was your weekend, man?  Oh, my goodness.  Obviously, mine sucked.  The weather was wonderful. 
[00:11:00]  Yes, it was.  The pool is open for business.  And, yeah, it was like a very first kind of summery weekend at my house.  Got a little sun.  I see that.  A little sun.  And that was about it.  Reminded me of what it was like, though, you know.  Because after winter, even though we didn't have a bad winter,  you kind of forget.  It's like just fucking hanging out.  Got your beverage, dude.  You buy your pool.  You're fucking sitting there.  Boom.  You're looking at pictures of bandoliers. 
[00:11:30]  Bandoliers.  What color should I buy?  Bobby fucking texted me.  I saw your tweet, sir.  Yeah, if I could, let me see if I could find this fucking text.  I saw your tweet.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, if I could, dude.  Here he goes.  Let's see.  Robert Kelly.  La-da-dee.  Hey, you want a bandolier?  I'm trying to get you guys a free one.  So what?  Gray?  What do you need?  Color gray, black on black, black with red stitch, tan, white. 
[00:12:00]  He fucking, he goes through them all in the text.  So I just take his text, I copy it, and just paste it right into Twitter.  He called me up yelling at me.  Damn, you fucking, yeah.  It was a text between us.  I'm like, you don't think I'm going to fucking tweet that moronic text with your dumb bandolier?  I don't want.  You don't want a bandolier?  No.  I told him I'd take one because, of course, he called me.  But he didn't text it.  He called me.  You ruined it for everyone.  I ruined it. 
[00:12:30]  You ruined it.  That would be good for traveling, right, Jimmy?  I think, you know, I think it would be, dude.  I said to myself, if I traveled a lot, then it would make sense.  So I can't beat up Bobby too much about it.  How was Washington?  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  I'd never done the club before.  Like, I did one spot there years ago.  Fucking amazing.  Five sold-out shows.  Fucking hardcore fans.  Great.  Unbelievable, yeah.  Very cool.  It's so nice to walk.  I don't know how Cincinnati will be this weekend.  Let's hope good.  Because that's a tough weekend. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, you've got to go to Cincinnati.  No, I'm just saying, because now it's time to rest and get ready for that special, man.  You've got two weeks to go, Jimmy.  Yeah, I've got to work out and work another week.  I'm there, though, with the special.  I've actually just switched the order around.  I got so bored doing it.  I just flopped the order.  You should just freestyle in Cincinnati.  Like, do nothing.  Nothing old.  Just get up there and freestyle for an hour.  I wish I had the balls to do that.  Because that's what guys do when they go out at the cellar.  Like, they'll actually just go up and do 45.  If she probably goes out, he'll do an hour or a crisp.  They'll just work on material. 
[00:13:30]  You could so easily do that.  Just fuck around with your characters and the crowd.  It's hard to do an hour like that.  I could do a few minutes like that.  Yeah.  It's hard to do an hour like that.  I'd panic.  Yeah.  If I'm not feeling it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That's going to suck like five minutes and you're like, I got 55 minutes.  Yeah, I got to go back to my act.  Oh.  And it's so obvious.  It's so obvious.  You got to go back to the act.  How was Gervais?  I was bummed I missed him.  Gervais was great as always.  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:00]  Really funny.  It's so easy to do radio with Ricky Gervais.  My God.  And he had fun with the Bailey.  I've been saying Bradley Jay all weekend because of there was a dude.  Bailey Jay.  I know.  But was Bailey here?  No, no.  But quickly, I kept saying Bradley Jay because that's the dude that used to work at BCN.  And I knew there was a reason why I kept calling Bailey Jay Bradley Jay.  But wouldn't it make sense that Bailey used to be Bradley?  Bradley. 
[00:14:30]  Was it Bradley?  I would assume.  I don't know.  I don't know what Bailey Jay's name was before.  Why would you call Bailey Jay anything but a girl's name?  I don't understand.  Oh, boy.  We showed Ricky Gervais.  A giant, luscious gift.  We showed Ricky Gervais and basically called it the ultimate question.  Which one would you go down on?  Bailey Jay or Buck Angel?  Yeah.  And he lost his fucking mind.  It was very hard for him to decide.  And then he answered us on Twitter later in the day.  But then I checked his feed and he deleted that post. 
[00:15:00]  So I think a publicist got to him like, look, you can't be talking about Mangina on your Twitter.  Yeah, probably.  You're an A-lister.  But he did answer the question.  And then he said he would go for Mangina over...  Mangina over...  Buck Angel.  Over Bradley.  Bailey Jay.  No, but over...  What did he say?  Female cock or something.  I don't know.  It was really funny.  Girl cock.  Girl cock.  Buck Angel freaks me out.  Like, like...  Because even though it's a real pussy...  Doesn't matter.  It's just...  The energy is male energy. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  And that's what fucking freaks me out.  That is it.  Exactly.  It's male energy.  Here's the question, because I just don't know.  Does the smell change when they start going through a bit of a change?  Couldn't get worse.  I think at the end, the smell would drive me nuts.  Like yambag.  Yeah, I don't know.  Like, if you're looking at Mangina, but because of the hormones or whatever, now there's a smell  of sweaty man, I think that would just drive me fucking batshit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But does Bailey Jay smell like a girl even though she has a penis? 
[00:16:00]  I only met her...  These are real questions we need answers.  These really are the questions that need to be asked.  She has like a girl's energy.  Like, when you talk to Bailey Jay, you don't feel like you're talking to a guy.  It's not that vibe.  Right.  But talking to Buck Angel, you get that masculine fucking vibe.  Well, to answer your question, Ricky Gervais had a ball with that.  Who did he take?  Oh, you said he did Mangina eventually.  Yeah, he went with Mangina.  Yeah, yeah.  But you're not going to find that tweet.  He fucking got rid of that tweet.  Who did you guys take?  I said, you got to go with Gina. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  Mangina.  In the end.  I didn't answer.  Close your eyes and dig in.  I didn't answer, and not so much because I'm afraid, you know, the people will be like,  what did you say, man?  You know, because I don't care.  But I honestly, it's such a quandary that I can't fucking figure it out.  It's really not.  In the end, a penis is a penis, man.  Yeah, I know.  I've said the same thing, but for different reasons.  That's the whole thing.  You're right.  And that's why I can't go that way.  But I can't go the other way either, because that's a fucking man. 
[00:17:00]  But you're not.  But, I mean, you're not even using your hands.  So it's easy, I think.  How about this?  You can use your hands.  You've got to cut the balls.  Would you make out with Bailey J and play with her tits, or go down on Buck Angel?  See, that's, now we're, wow, now.  See, see what you did there.  Because what you said is correct.  The penis is a penis.  Like, that is the game changer.  But would you make out with fucking Bailey J?  See, now you're really fucking everything up.  We had easy answers on Friday.  Bailey J, does she have man breath? 
[00:17:30]  No, she smells, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't actually smell her breath.  And whiskers.  Would you get whisker rash?  Would you make out with her for the show?  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  No.  Not for the show, probably.  But for the show, no.  I wouldn't.  Not for the show.  Not for the show.  No.  Oh, man.  Well, what if we said it's not gay because it's for the show?  Would you do it?  Well, it's always not gay for the show.  Yeah, it's blatant.  You know how many times I've had to have that conversation on the way home?  No show in sight.  Exactly. 
[00:18:00]  What show, Jim?  And then that's the part of me that just goes, what show, Jim?  You should have microphones in your car.  No.  No, you don't have to turn them on, but at least you feel like you're doing it for the show.  For the show.  For the show.  For the show.  Yeah, there's certain ones that are very, very hard to tell and very, very passable,  and that's really difficult to make that decision to make out with.  But then the penis says hi, and then, you know, I don't know.  Well, the way they have it, you wouldn't notice it.  They tuck back.  Gotcha.  I love the story of, every once in a while, a story comes out where, like, the guy had 
[00:18:30]  no idea that the chick you was with had a penis.  I'm like, come on.  How is that possible?  Really?  Really?  How is that possible?  I don't know.  You mean dating-wise?  Yeah.  And then you interview them.  We've had a bunch of these over the years, and they're like, yeah, man, we had sex and  everything.  I had no idea.  What?  What?  Exactly what?  How'd that work?  Oh, they probably, you know, had, you know, maybe an ass.  Well, yeah.  Sucky, sucky.  But where does the penis go? 
[00:19:00]  Just flopping there, and you're not noticing?  It's just between there, taped under, and you're looking, what's that poking out?  It can happen.  Not saying hi.  Oh, God.  It can happen.  Ha, ha, ha, Jimmy.  It could happen.  I've told the story.  What?  I've told the story when I used to live in Jersey years ago.  Yeah.  And I was fucking dropping that chick off in the projects, and I told her that.  You fooled around with her?  I fucked her.  No bag.  But you didn't know there was...  No, I genuinely didn't know.  You didn't know there was no penis?  Where was the penis?  No, there was a penis, but I didn't know.  I realized that while I was fucking, I finished anyway. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  No, then you realized.  Yeah, but I really, I would tell you...  At that point, I think you pretty much, you know, have to...  At this point, I would tell you if I really did know, but I honestly didn't  know, and then found out in the middle of it.  Yeah, I was a little bit more...  For some reason, there was a point in my life where I really thought if there was breasts,  I would always check for breasts.  I'll never forget that new Brunswick cop, sober buddy of mine, going, well, they get  fake tits.  Yeah, what are you doing?  I don't know why they didn't...  What about the Adam's apple?  You never checked for that. 
[00:20:00]  No, when it's dark, dude, and someone's getting in the car, a lot of times when you're  not doing that, you don't...  Right.  You look...  But where was the penis?  That you didn't know at first.  Well, it was where the penis should be.  No, I understand all that.  But we pulled into...  This was the projects in Jersey, so we parked behind a fucking dumpster.  And did she...  Did she...  She was sucking my dick.  Did she say, like, do me any ass?  I don't even know if it got spoken about.  I just know that I couldn't...  She just knew where to go?  Because it was...  Oh, it was a hooker who I was dropping off, and it wasn't...  The high for me was not paying for it.  I couldn't believe I wasn't being charged. 
[00:20:30]  Whoa.  No shit.  It was just a dirty thing.  I just wanted a fucking dick in his ass.  Jimmy was there.  Yeah, that was a rough time.  You were dropping off hookers in the projects?  I was going from...  Oh, you're dangerous, dude.  It was one of those things where it was like, can I have a ride back to New Jersey?  Oh, my God.  And that happened a few different times.  There was one girl who I would drop off all the time.  And she lived somewhere in Jersey.  And if I happened to see her on my way home, because I would always look at the whores, 
[00:21:00]  this is when they were walking around in the fucking...  In the 40s and the 50s by the Hess, they would always walk around 10th Avenue right there.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  That Hess station was crazy.  Yeah, dude, that was fucking infested.  That is such a clean area now, man.  That's where I get my gas when...  Yeah, right, right, right.  No, because there's not many places you get gas in New York City.  The block right before that, and where Bobby and I used to live on 43rd Street...  That whole area is, like, as nice as could be.  Years ago was terrible, and then by the...  Holy fuck.  When I started doing comedy, and I was doing...  I was, like, in the late 90s, mid-90s. 
[00:21:30]  That was fucking still very, very dingy and Hell's Kitchen-y.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  So, Washington was good.  It was great, too.  Yeah, me and Kenny walked around a lot.  Washington.  I just saw the White House.  I've done it a million times, but when I go down to Washington, I love just wandering around  and going to as many memorials as possible.  I usually throw on my...  I used to throw on my rollerblades so you could get to this shit fast.  We took a subway to go to the mall. 
[00:22:00]  Did you go up to the grave?  No.  JFK?  No, I couldn't find it.  We walked around.  You've never done that?  I just didn't see it.  It's way at the top of the hill.  Oh.  It's a long walk.  You've got to walk across that fucking bridge, then you get to the cemetery, and then it's  a long walk up the hill.  I thought it was at the White House.  Is it Arlington or no?  Arlington Cemetery, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you have to cross that bridge.  I didn't realize that.  Well, you cross that bridge when you come to it.  Yeah.  We took the subway.  No, it's far from everything else.  We took the subway to get to a mall because I wanted to find a pair of jeans and some 
[00:22:30]  shoes.  Yeah.  And Kenny on the subway.  It's very confusing.  The DC subway is creepy, dude.  It's fucking...  It's brand new, though.  It's so nice.  But it's dark.  It's literally...  It's fucking...  It's like the lights are off.  Are the lights on?  It's fucking...  No.  Why is it dark?  I don't know.  The last time I was there, it was beautiful.  All lit up.  Pitch black.  Really dark inside.  Very, very creepy.  That sounds dangerous.  It was scary.  And Kenny the whole time was just...  We get on the train and there's a guy in front of us.  And Kenny, just like a big dummy, sits down and he's like, mister, are we going the right 
[00:23:00]  way for the Pentagon City Mall?  Mister.  And he's going, I've never been on the subway before.  And then you look at the girl next to him.  It's my first time on a train.  It was so fucking embarrassing.  Why don't you film this?  Nah, because it's in the moment.  You don't think of it.  He's so embarrassing.  It's fucking...  I don't want...  I don't even think of it in that moment.  I'm so embarrassed.  Because you're just shocked.  I was like, ah.  That's great.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's so fucking funny.  It was very, very embarrassing. 
[00:23:30]  My first time on a train.  My first time on the train.  Thank you, mister.  What a big lunkhead.  Or a doorman.  Excuse me, officer.  Oh, he did one of those.  And he won in a uniform.  Yeah, it was somebody in the mall.  Like a mall security guy.  We had a question.  Thank you, officer.  Officer.  You didn't go to the Vietnam Memorial?  Ah, that's what we didn't think.  I didn't think of it.  Where is that?  It's right in the middle of everything.  I didn't think of it.  I would love to have gone there.  In between what? 
[00:24:00]  The Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument kind of reflection pool.  It's sort of to the left over there, right?  If you're looking out from the, I think.  The reflecting pool.  That's a must-see every time you're in Washington.  I totally forgot about it.  That thing blows you away every fucking time you see it.  My sleep is so bad.  I'm waking up.  I tell you, I wake up.  I feel high.  I wanted to go out and do shit.  And we walk out.  I'm literally tired in 20 minutes because I'm not sleeping.  Jimmy.  It's terrible.  It's fucking horrible. 
[00:24:30]  Horrible.  And it's not.  I went to the sleep doctor.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Oh, you got to go for another 10.  Oh, I read this.  Some of those tweets.  They just keep fucking you.  Right.  Yeah, the referral.  And then this.  And then the appointment that takes forever, right?  It's terrible, man.  But anyway, that's why.  So it's like you wake up and you want to go do these things.  Oh, my God.  And you're like, oh, I can't do anything.  Yeah.  It's fucking terrible.  I love Washington.  It's been a while.  I want to go on a vacation.  Like, I want to go for a few days and just not work and just walk around.  See the sights.  Take in the sights. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Wonderful.  You go and see where Abe Blinken was shot.  That was the Ford's Theater.  Yeah.  Where was that?  President Budinsky.  Dude, let's go together.  I'll show you.  I didn't know.  I'll show you Washington.  The Ford's Theater thing is amazing.  Didn't even know about it.  And it looks exactly the same, really.  They preserved that place.  And then you go across the street where he died.  They washed the wall.  I didn't realize that.  With the blood still on the bed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  They got that pillow, right?  Is it the pillow?  His pillow.  What's that?  Big dumb head.  He's got a big... 
[00:25:30]  I didn't know that.  And that's in D.C.?  Yeah.  That's right.  Big blood stain on it.  The area's a little shaky.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But is it fucking all like bulletproof glass off?  I don't remember anymore.  I remember you kind of got to like, you know, the room.  And I guess you could kind of peek in one of those things.  Yeah.  I don't think there was any glass up there.  Oh, that's the presidential balcony.  The little box in the Ford's Theater.  I believe it's the same chair and everything.  Where he was sitting when he got his fucking...  I can't see it. 
[00:26:00]  Same fucking chair and everything.  Isn't it amazing?  A guy was able to just sneak in, open the door to the president's fucking little private  balcony and shoot him.  Jesus.  Yeah.  He wasn't that high up, was he?  No.  High enough.  I would have thought you were higher up than...  No.  High enough for John Wilkes Booth to break his leg.  John Wayne...  John Wilkes Booth was behind him, right?  He snuck him behind him?  Oh, yeah.  Snuck him behind him.  Pulled back the curtain and shot him.  And then jumped onto the stage.  Broke his leg.  Why did he go out the way he came in?  Wow.  I don't know.  Well, he wanted to make that big fucking... 
[00:26:30]  I did it.  What did he say?  What did he say?  Something Tyrannus.  Right?  Death to tyrants in fucking Latin.  Whatever the fuck it is.  Something Tyrannus?  Yeah.  Tyrannus death or something?  Tyrannusaurus Rex, he yelled.  I don't know.  And then he hit the stage and busted his leg.  Parlez-vous français.  You lost me, honey.  They gave the president shitty seats.  Look.  All the way to the side of the stage.  Oh, man.  You're not even seeing really...  Oh, man.  Why would you sit the president there?  Wow.  Some really nice seats in that theater. 
[00:27:00]  Full view of everyone.  You gotta go, man.  Dude, I didn't think about it.  I didn't know.  You gotta go just because, like, nothing has changed.  They have preserved this theater.  I'm so bummed about sleeping.  I wanna go.  I wanna do this shit when I'm on the road.  I woke up nice and early.  Went to bed, got like a nice seven-hour sleep.  And it's like you feel like you haven't slept.  Oh, Jimmy.  Where's the bed where he died across the street, I believe?  I believe it was across the street, right?  It's been a while.  I don't know.  The fact's totally...  And...  Yeah, and then you get to see this.  There's the bed. 
[00:27:30]  Wow.  Well, that's a well-made bed.  But that's nice.  That doesn't have the bloody pillow.  You sure that's the bed?  No, it was some little shitty, hot-looking bed.  That's probably the Lincoln bedroom, Sam, in the White House.  Yeah.  That was a White House bedroom.  Oh, Sam.  Yeah, this is more like it.  That's it.  Stop spoiling everything, Sam.  It was a shitty bed.  There's the blood on the pillow still.  Lincoln's fucking bloody pillow.  Oh, man.  I would...  How much would you spend for that?  Well, it'd be hard.  You couldn't resell it.  There's only one.  Who cares? 
[00:28:00]  I bet...  That's something you could have in your place and go, here, I got it.  I bet that wasn't even from the head one.  That's probably when he was propping Mary Todd's ass up with it.  She had a little problem.  But they don't want to tell anyone.  Yeah.  It's actually period blood.  Yeah.  You want to get one more in before he died.  Was he...  Is that him in the bed?  No, that's his...  That's the bed right after, though.  That's a picture taken...  Oh, wow.  Like, right after they moved him.  Is that an Instagram picture?  Or is that...  Yeah.  Instagramming back then.  Did he die in the bed or did he die in the theater when he got first shot? 
[00:28:30]  Was he alive?  No, he was alive.  I think he was alive for a little bit.  Yeah.  Conscious or they don't know?  But it didn't look good, though.  Sure.  It was a big fucking...  Yeah, it was like a big hunk of lead just went in behind his ear and lodged behind his eyeball.  Oh, God.  And then he just bled out over there.  I think he was dead.  He lasted...  I want to say he lasted almost...  He did last a little while.  Well, I'm pretty sure...  A day or more?  Maybe...  No more than a day.  Maybe like 12, 16 hours, I would guess.  Yeah, something like that.  Something like that, if I remember correctly. 
[00:29:00]  I love our history courses here where we're like, something like that.  I don't know.  We don't know.  Maybe.  Could be.  Possibly.  Why would you need this knowledge?  Exactly.  You just need basic knowledge.  Correct him, Wendell.  He got shot in a dumb theater and he went across the street and died.  That's all you need to know.  Isn't it weird that when you think of a time like that, there was no internal medicine?  Like, there was no anesthesia?  It was very difficult to...  Yeah, yeah.  I just saw the episode of Game of Thrones where there's...  Did you see the one?  No, no, no.  There's not...  You know, I'm basically...  It's where...  Did you just say it was from that era and they had to saw off...  Oh, they would just cut off people's limbs. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And it was like, you've heard about it being done, but they show it briefly and they show  the fucking soldier biting down on something.  This is back in the night's time.  Yeah.  You know, he had like a wallet or something or leather.  Oh, right.  Whatever it was.  And you could hear that like...  You could hear the saw going...  It was fucking...  You can't see it.  You can just hear it and hear him screaming and you can realize what a process it is  to saw through a foot and it was fucking horrible. 
[00:30:00]  I'm like, there was no internal medicine back in the days.  During the Civil War, it was...  That was pretty much standard operating procedure for a limb that was shot.  Like, they didn't...  If you got shot in the arm with a mini ball and your bones were shattered, they didn't  have a way of fucking, yeah, we're gonna...  And then you'll go to rehabilitation and then we'll...  They fucking sawed your arm off.  That was it.  They said outside these hospitals, these field hospitals, outside the door to the actual  tent, with piles of limbs during these huge battles where tens of thousands were wounded. 
[00:30:30]  There'd just be piles of fucking arms and legs where they would just keep sawing it off.  And the surgeon was covered in blood.  No...  They didn't know about disinfecting anything.  So they would just have the guy's blood on you from before, the same saw, and he's just  sawing through another leg.  So a lot of these guys died of infection.  More people died of illness than they did of actual gunshot wounds and explosions.  Well, how would they seal the wound?  Would they do it with flames or would they cauterize it? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, they would cauterize the fucking stump.  What would they use?  Oh!  Yeah, like hot...  What do they use?  Something really hot?  A fucking bottom of a frying pan.  For real?  Wow!  God, that would have hurt a lot!  That would really fucking hurt.  Oh, would that hurt?  A frying pan?  Yeah.  Red hot frying pan.  Yeah, just keep the frying pan on the fire and just...  How long can you take it before...  You pass out, probably.  I got a really...  It's finally healing, but I burnt the shit out of my belly. 
[00:31:30]  It was on there for a half a second.  What was it?  What was it?  You don't even want to know.  Oh, no.  What were you doing?  I have to say now, I was shirtless in my apartment.  Let me turn on the lady for a second here.  And I was getting a pan out of the fucking stove.  Peter?  Peter.  Yeah.  And I pulled it out right into my belly.  Yeah.  And excruciating, holy fuck, pain for probably a quarter of a second.  Wow, yeah, that'll hurt.  Red fucking, like, line. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  That is finally healing three weeks later.  All I'm saying is, I took it for less than what?  A split second.  And it's excruciating.  It's a split second.  They're taking a hot fucking frying pan.  Yeah.  And I'm wondering how long they hold that on before it does the job.  Bleeding stops, I gather.  I wonder if that's long.  How do you do that?  Oh, that's terrible.  Anyway, we can look that up.  A civil war wound.  Like, how is a...  A civil war wound.  Yeah, like, fixing a...  I wanted to see how they would do that. 
[00:32:30]  Amputation.  Yeah, that's what it is.  You know, wartime, though, they do learn a lot about medicine.  Like, pre-civil war and post-civil war medicine is amazing because they learn so much  during the war.  Same thing with World War II, Vietnam.  But that was supposed to just be barbaric.  I mean, the thought of getting wounded to a lot of these guys were worse than the thought  of getting killed because they just knew what a horror it was to go into these field hospitals. 
[00:33:00]  What did the first one say, Sam, that you looked at the arm?  Oh, they're talking about cutting the arm off.  Can I add something to this?  Sure.  People actually went to medical school to learn this shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess anyone could have went to medical school.  Yeah, right.  Think about it.  Well, take your saw.  Right.  Now, back and forth motion.  Right.  And then we're going to take a red hot frying pan and we're going to put it on the wound  until it stops bleeding.  Who can't do that?  Wow.  These amputations were not only used in military practice, but civil practice to treat injuries, 
[00:33:30]  sustained accidents.  There was two main methods used to amputate large limbs during the war.  Flap and circular amputations.  Oh.  In the field, the flap method was more widely used when time was a factor.  With this method, the bone was dissected and flaps of deep muscle and skin were used to  close the operation.  Oh.  When implementing the flap method, it was imperative to cut the bone away a few inches above the 
[00:34:00]  place where the flaps were brought together.  Could you lift that up, Sam?  I'm guessing that's so...  Why was it imperative?  I'm guessing so you could fold it over like a sleeve.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Yeah, you couldn't have a bone poking through your flap.  Did they always sterilize the saws?  They didn't even know that yet, Ant?  No, they didn't sterilize shit.  Are you sure?  Civil War times?  Maybe a little alcohol just to clean stuff off, but I don't think it was...  But you think Civil War times, they weren't dumb.  They probably figured out...  No, they were pretty stupid.  They were still dumb.  Yeah.  So, how long would you last after this procedure? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, man.  It said the flap method presented a problem when patients was to be transported long distances  soon or directly after the surgery because the muscles that are used in the flaps to cover  became gangrenous when moving the patient about.  This one guy...  Oh, Jesus.  G.J. Guthrie recommended the circular method because the coverings were made primarily of  skin and surface muscle.  In military surgery, the flap procedure brought about more sloughing and secondary hemorrhages 
[00:35:00]  than that of circular amputation.  This was especially noted...  Enjoy your breakfast.  When you look at the...  Good morning.  You can see they're showing you diagrams...  Yeah, of how they were cut.  ...of like a scalpel slicing through bone and where on the knee and where on the...  But imagine going right through the middle of your fucking knee.  Ah, like a chicken bone.  Could you ask Bobo if we could do this to him to get him back on the show?  An amputation.  I don't know. 
[00:35:30]  I don't want to be amputated, right?  Right?  Right?  Right?  For the show.  I don't want a circular flap, right?  Oh, I guess.  Maybe for the show you could cut off Mr. Maloonigan's legs.  Oh, all right.  How does he say that?  Oh, all right.  All right.  Dogs would take the limbs.  Oh, really?  That doesn't sound very nice.  Well, what are you going to do with the limbs?  Wow, this hooker's amazing.  Huh?  Wow. 
[00:36:00]  She's got to be a model for the post.  Yeah, she's a model.  I'm looking for the Secret Service hooker.  Yeah, we should talk about that after the break.  Secret Service hooker flap.  Over $47.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Why don't we break?  Ooh.  I just want to acknowledge that playoff hockey is just amazing.  We don't have to talk about it.  We don't even have to talk about it.  I just want to say that.  Oh, yeah?  To my brothers and sisters out there that are enjoying the hell out of the playoffs this year.  Is it reasonable? 
[00:36:30]  Why don't they play like this during the regular season?  There would be so many more fans.  Well, you really put your game face on for the playoffs.  You put your game face on.  Do they not?  They notch it up and beat the shit out of each other the whole game.  I guess because they know they don't have to last the whole season, you know, so they  could let it all hang out.  Put it all on the line.  They skate so much harder.  They play harder.  They beat the shit out of each other harder.  I haven't been keeping tabs.  Oh, man.  I've been watching the same shit I always watched.  Do yourself a favor because someone actually tweeted this, and I believe them. 
[00:37:00]  There could possibly be a murder in game four of the Flyers-Penguins series.  A little bit of a rivalry.  And it's three games to none in favor of the Flyers.  Nice.  So the Penguins have nothing to lose, but, you know, they're going to want to beat the  shit out of the Flyers at the very least.  Game four is going to be insane.  I think it's, uh, I think it's, is it tonight?  Might be tonight.  Or tomorrow.  Tonight?  Tonight?  Tomorrow?  Or tomorrow.  What? 
[00:37:30]  Tonight?  What?  And the Flyers are using Hulk Hogan.  You want to get this out of the way?  This is the only thing I want to do as far as hockey goes.  What is he doing?  And then I'll shut my fucking mouth.  Oh, is that the Hulk video you mentioned?  I think it meant the Incredible Hulk.  I think it was Hulk Hogan.  You want to play the video version there, Sam?  The Hulkster.  Do you like this, Sam?  Well, you do, huh?  Hulk Hogan gets the Flyers fans pumped for the games.  Does she have a Renna Center commercial?  It's, uh, they like it, though.  Get a TV, brother.  Really?  They like it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:38:00]  He's in front of a green screen, right?  Wait, where do they show this?  And they put the arena behind him.  They show this up on the big screen.  Ew.  And the crowd noise really helps it.  Sam pointed this out.  Because when you hear just the dry audio, it's really douche-chilly.  Oh, well, it's douche-chilly anyway.  But they fucking love this dumb thing.  This dumb little thing Hulk Hogan did.  Hit it without...  You want to play it without the crowd noise?  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  I want to douche-chilly.  They're actually playing this on the big, uh, the big screen.  Hey, Flyer fans! 
[00:38:30]  This is the real Hulk Hogan!  And I know you've been saying your prayers and eating your vitamins, but I got one thing  to say.  What you gonna do when Flyers Mania runs wild on you?  What year is this?  What year is this?  Huh?  What year is this?  Flyer Mania?  Hulk-a-mania?  What you gonna do when...  Can you play with the crowd noise? 
[00:39:00]  Because it works way better.  Iraq, you're embarrassing loving this guy.  Yeah.  Kind of.  It's so hard to defend him anymore.  I like it, Iraq.  Do you like that, Iraq?  Oh, it's so douche-chilly.  Yeah.  It is.  Play with the crowd noise, though.  But, you know, with the crowd yelling and screaming, then it kind of makes sense, yeah?  It really does.  Yeah?  Sure.  I want to hear it with the crowd noise.  All right.  That was the dry audio.  Well, you should play it off that.  You want me to just play it off this?  All right.  Fair enough. 
[00:39:30]  Do-do-do-do-do.  And here it is with the crowd noise.  Hey, Flyers!  This is the real Hulk Hogan!  Ah!  What they're looking up at is a video.  What they're looking up at is a complete douchebag. 
[00:40:00]  An irrelevant fucking douchebag.  What you're going to do when Flyer Mania runs wild?  Oh, God.  The Flyers were kicking that.  He is just a douche.  The Flyers were kicking the Penguins' asses.  Penguins' asses?  How do you say that?  Penguins' asses?  Penguins' asses.  And the chant, because people couldn't really understand it, was,  You can't beat us.  Dude, you've got to watch.  I'm telling you.  He really is still in shape, though.  Hulk? 
[00:40:30]  Hulk Hogan.  But he's pulling that shirt off, though.  I mean, he's still got fucking ab muscles.  He's still a big dude, and I still...  What?  He can't walk, though.  Oh, yeah.  He's in bad shape.  He can barely walk?  He can't wrestle, yeah.  He can't wrestle anymore?  He can't do...  You know how his finishing move is the big boot and the leg drop?  Yeah.  He can't lift his leg up.  Wow.  That's going to suck.  So he can't hit a big boot or a leg drop.  So what's he doing, like, a little boot?  Like, little boots, boots.  And he needs to wrestle.  He needs to wrestle, because his wife got all the money.  Even though she never wrestled. 
[00:41:00]  That's so weird how that works out for the ladies.  Very strange.  She didn't wrestle one match, but she pretty much has more money than him now.  Really weird how the courts take care of everybody.  In his house?  Yeah.  Yeah, how did he give up his own house?  Well, she's on couples therapy now on VH1.  With her new boyfriend?  With the surfer dude?  Oh, she can't get enough attention.  With young Hulk Hogan?  Young Hulk, yeah.  It's the young Hulkster.  All right, good.  All right, listen, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, Travis turned us on to something nice. 
[00:41:30]  Really?  The fucking resignation?  Wait till you see Tupac.  Tupac performed this weekend.  On stage and everything.  I'm going to leave it at that.  Amazing.  I'm going to leave it at that.  We'll explain next.  The Okie Anthony Channel.  Sirius XM.  Join us as comedian and psychoanalyst Bob Kelly discusses Anthony Cumia's need to be loved.  Everything everybody in this room does is a scream to fucking love me. 
[00:42:00]  You are banging nails, you fucking afro faggot.  You're the only cocksucker that went backwards in his career.  You're supposed to start with a podcast and work your way up to a hit show, not work your way backwards, fuckheads.  Damn.  I'm fucking at two in the morning on the internet.  I know.  We're all screaming for someone to love us, okay?  It just so happens I do it in 140 characters.  I didn't buy a TV studio and put it in my mansion and go on and hire fucking all my friends to come over and hang with me, okay? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, it's called hire.  When you buy booze, that's fucking money.  I don't hire my friends.  That's fucking monetary fucking gain for these guys.  If you didn't have shit over there, if you had fucking pretzels, would Danny show up?  No.  Probably.  No.  He's got a fucking fat Guinness in his hand and he gets to drink for free all night over some tap you have downstairs.  All right.  Bobby is really good.  Life for prehistoric man was not easy.  Until now, very little has been revealed about the existence of Cro-Magnon man. 
[00:43:00]  The concept of the chair was still a mystery, so posture was a chronic problem.  Always squatting, you're using two hands to do something.  That's what they would do.  They would always squat with their balls by the dirt like.  Pounding a rock into something to make fire.  Communication was, as you might imagine, primitive.  So thoughts were often misconstrued.  You can't, there's no internet, you just gotta draw a picture of a buffalo on the wall and you're like, ugh, man, I don't know what you mean.  Without medical knowledge or technique, prehistoric man relied on less sophisticated methods to treat ailments. 
[00:43:30]  You get a toothache, you just gotta lay there and chew a piece of fucking bark.  Even the simple act of sheltering oneself from the elements was a daunting task for the Neanderthal.  Hey, it's chilly, let's push that rock in front of the fucking mountainside we live in.  It's too cold to go outside, so let's just shit against what would be the kitchen or the parlor.  And ferocious predators lingered around every corner.  Where's Ted?  I'm Ted and I don't know what I'm doing!  He was devoured by something that flew out of a tree.  Living as a caveman really sucked, didn't it?  Nothing to do, except survive.  Yeah.  Live.

No, it's just  I don't know  It's the same reason I don't like blues  Oh, God  I love the blues  I don't like modern  It's too repetitive  I don't like modern day blues  I need my blues to be kind of just down and dirty 
[00:47:00]  I need something a little more  Horrible recordings with scratching  And you can hear all the scratches  I like music a little more complex  A little more harmonic  Things like that, you know  I kind of like that  I think that's why I don't like that  You're a dream theater guy  Well, not really  But  Jazz?  I just don't  Oh, jazz  The only time I listen to jazz  Is when I go into the fucking bathroom  And it's playing  And it just, to me, is noise  They're all playing something different 
[00:47:30]  Right  Stop it  Buddy Holly did that originally  Okay  That's Buddy Holly's  I am  It seems like you listen to a lot of jazz  Because you just nailed it  In the bathroom  You forgot the horns and all that, didn't you?  Oh, that's a  Oh, okay  Oh, God  It's so annoying 
[00:48:00]  You don't like when they play their instruments?  I hate it  They're all playing something completely different  And people are supposed to sit there and be like  Wow, I'm such an intellectual  And I appreciate this  And you're too stupid, too  Miles Davis  Oh, God  Let's go with the Miles Davis  Not for him  Oh, let's not fade away  Oh, let's not fade away  Cheeks  Oh  Oh, you have Buddy Holly there  I look like an asshole  Not fade away  You look like assholes, man  Well, not fade away and hand jive has the exact same groove  Yeah  Boy, do I look like a fucking asshole  What does Buddy Holly's version sound like? 
[00:48:30]  Was that music Buddy Holly's music?  Yeah, the Crickets recorded it  The song's rhythm pattern is a variant of the Bo Diddley beat  Right  Yeah, it's Bo Diddley all the way  Jimmy was right about that  Okay, this sounds  I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be  See, it sounds right, but with him  Yeah, but they had to add some doo-wops in there  I don't like the doo-wops in there  It's like a rockabilly  Rockabilly  Yeah, true  I love Buddy Holly  You cannot like Buddy Holly  Grateful Dead does a great version of Not Fade Away  For God, you cannot like him  You like the Grateful Dead, right?  Yeah, exactly 
[00:49:00]  American Airlines  You like the Grateful Dead?  Oh, God, I hate the Grateful Dead  They do a good version of Not Fade Away  Oh, God  Yeah, is it 25 minutes long?  Well, it might be  Jeez  It might be  Some hairy, armpitted hippie girl  Well, sure  Dancing to it  Well  Spinning around in a tie-dyed skirt  Yeah, well, nothing wrong with that  Trying to fucking sell you acid  The Grateful Dead performed it 530 times  Making it their 7th most performed song  7th most?  I don't know  Yeah, it's going to be something no one's ever heard 
[00:49:30]  Because they're so groovy  Rockabilly jam  What?  Rockabilly jam  Is it dumb jams?  That so could be a Grateful Dead song  Oh, of course it could  Oh, look  Listen to this  Turn this up  Now we're talking  Just the most performed  Me and My Uncle  Me and My Uncle  Is the number one Grateful Dead song  Ever played  605  Who keeps cracking it?  Oh, of course  There's plenty of people  You know what?  Only 605?  I'm looking at the top 8 most played songs  By the Grateful Dead  I like a bunch of them  Sugar Magnolia 
[00:50:00]  You like the Sugar Magnolia, right?  I hate it  Oh, come on  I fucking hate it  Let's do this  Wait, how does this Sugar Magnolia  What song is this?  This is Not Fade Away  That's what it says  Grateful Dead  Not Fade Away  Now, where's the uncle song?  Me and My Uncle  You don't know  What we're talking about  Do you know what we're looking for?  I was pulling up Grateful Dead songs  That shit used to make me bad  Now it's just hilarious  He just doesn't give a fuck anymore  I want me and my uncle  I don't blame him  But  We were looking for 
[00:50:30]  The number one Grateful Dead song  Of all time  Which is  Well  Which they played in concert  605 times  Me and My Uncle  The list, by the way  Because, you know  This drives people nuts  They need the whole list  Me and My Uncle  Number one  Sugar Magnolia  Which I like  Number two  Playing in the band  You like playing in the band?  Nope  Playing in the band  Oh, I know  Playing in the band  Blah, blah, blah  Then we go with the other one  I don't know if I really know that song  And then China Cat Sunflower  I Know You, Rider 
[00:51:00]  Not Fade Away  Truckin' is number eight  Truckin'  Who would fucking want to go to a concert  That's five hours long  And listen to this dribble  Wait, this is okay  No, it's not  Did you ever get into the Grateful Dead?  Never  Ah, I kinda like some of this stuff  Never  I kinda like it  This is fine  Yeah, I don't mind this  I don't like when they just jam mindlessly for two hours  But this is okay  Well, that might be Drums in Space 
[00:51:30]  Drums in Space?  That's when you wander around and see what's going on in the arena  Buy some spaghetti from people cooking it in the parking lot  Well, yeah  Oh, sounds great  Ugh  Some disgusting fucking hippie  Well, yeah  Filthy  Making you spaghetti so they can fucking charge your money and buy acid  Drums in Space is definitely rough  You have to be like tripping  I'm seeing a lot of 12 minute videos on YouTube for Drums in Space  Oh, that's  You gotta wait easy if it's only 12 minutes 
[00:52:00]  This one says it's a particularly intriguing Drums in Space  Why?  I don't know  You wanna play it?  No  Hold on  Let's find out why this is intriguing  We won't do the whole thing, I promise  Drums in Space, Grateful Dead  9, 10, 1991, Madison Square Garden  This just sounds like somebody is throwing drums down the stairs  It's just like  Oh, there goes the tom-tom  Bump, bump, there it goes  Down the stairs  It sounds like when somebody first plays the drums  Yeah, yeah  They think they're brilliant for this 
[00:52:30]  That's not that good  No  No, it sounds like when you used to go to Sam Ash with your friends  And just like get on the drums and just start playing them  You know why?  I don't know  But I assume the Grateful Dead's not a band that's gonna be like Tommy Lee  Going off like a bullshit crazy on a drum solo  You know?  Or like fucking  Dude, it's a journey  They're going on a journey right now  They don't even know where they're gonna go with this  It's this percussive masturbation 
[00:53:00]  It's fucking horrible  Look, double drumming  That's crazy, listen to that  This self-indulgent shit  Imagine you're sitting there going  Yeah  Yeah  This is great, thanks  I've been to a handful of Grateful Dead shows over the years  And it's my least favorite part of the show  I'm not hearing any like  I can't argue with this  I'm not hearing that  I can't argue that point  Yeah, this kind of stinks  I never got the drums in space 
[00:53:30]  You don't find it particularly intriguing?  No  If they were playing with their dicks, I might  Could you fast-forward this 12-and-a-half-minute video  Oh, shit  To see if they got anywhere?  Yeah, let's see if they actually got somewhere  Let's see where the journey goes  This is halfway through the journey  That is drums in space  I guess the bass and  Look, it looks like your face is melting  Now they're, what amounts to tuning their instruments over?  Look at the video  It's just all these effects  They make it look like everyone's melting  A wave  Does anybody really say drums in space?  I love this, turn this up 
[00:54:00]  I love this  Am I the first person to ever say those words?  Well, it's not made for radio airplay, that's for sure  I guess it's for the  I don't know  I mean, people that know the culture of the Grateful Dead  Would explain it better  But I guess it's for everyone tripping  Drums in space, Matt  You don't like that?  No, I would say we're trying to get to space on the Challenger  It's terrible  Fuck drums in space  We were getting topical with E-Rock 
[00:54:30]  Oh  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 65 today  Bill Belichick, 60 today  And this one just hurts us a bit older, guys  Michael Jordan played his final NBA game  Nine years ago  Holy fuck  Ready?

[01:04:30]  this is the future this is what's going to happen you're going to see elvis again you're going to see a beatles reunion i think slash should have gotten axel at the hall of fame by doing this last week  how many fucking bed jokes are you going to fire he's shot all these down  homerun homerun homerun  homerun  homerun  homerun  homerun  homerun  he said help me will i am kenobi  yeah exactly  hey that's my joke  help me no he said help me will i am kenobi  it was a little shaky  i was saying  i was saying a moment ago  he was a star  yeah a musical star that is entirely hologram there is no real life basis for her and john pointed out there was a movie a dozen years ago 
[01:05:00]  Pacino's Simone  yo you can download the plans to the death star  It's in my dick.  Yeah, bitches.  This is already better than the fucking Star Wars one, though.  It's already better.  The cantina's playing.  And Tupac's dancing.  Tupac's dancing around.  Motherfucking blue elephant and shit.  Playing a horn and shit.  Who's getting the rights money on that?  I hope it's Spanish.

[01:06:00]  Oh, I'm a toodley-doin' motherfucker.  They just suck on CNN, huh?  Holograms.  That's horrendous.  Yeah, bitchy!  That was pretty cool, though.  Was Coachella a rap thing, or is it-  No, it's very eclectic.  Radiohead.  Yeah.  Dr. Dre Snoop.  The Black Keys, what's that?  Yeah.  Yeah, the Black Keys headline, the first night, Radiohead, Dr. Dre Snoop.  A lot of people like the Black Keys.  A lot of people love the Black Keys.  I don't know much about the Black Keys. 
[01:06:30]  They're a good straight rock band.  I didn't meet them.  I didn't meet them.  Oh.  Oh, you should have.  I know they are.  I just had to leave.  They've got a huge fan base.  Yeah.  Did I tell you?  All right.  Are you Biggie Smalls or Tupac?  I never got into either one of them, but I think Biggie I like better from what I've  heard.  Tupac is very good, but-  Biggie hilarious.  I never really listened to either one of those guys.  I was listening to a Biggie Smalls song over the weekend where he's talking about licking  pussy and eating ass and making money, and I never heard this song before, and I fucking 
[01:07:00]  loved it.  I got to get a Greatest Hits Biggie Smalls or something.  I have to.  How many of you have at it?  I have to.  It could be that many.  He's got enough.  But I would love to know the name of the song I heard over the weekend.  Just the dirtiest song ever.  It's like, this was never played on the radio.  Oh, he's always just like, you're sucking my dick.  Bugger motherfuckers going.  I love it.  It's all gangster shit, yo.  Gangster.  But just how he raps.  Oh, yeah.  It seems like effortless. 
[01:07:30]  I don't know shit about him, but every time I hear one of his songs, I love it.  He passed away.  Yeah.  He passed away.  I don't know what you're going to do.  Give it up.  Give it up, yo.  Brooklyn in the his.  We got a bad home run call.  Are you following your Yankees yet, or is it too early?  It's a little too early still.  I'm kind of just, you know.  I know, you know, they had a nice blowout last night, right?  I've been starting these chants.  I've been going, let's go, Yankees! 
[01:08:00]  I heard.  Sport fans are idiots.  I heard Susan Wallman lost it when Jorge Posada threw out the first pitch to his own father.  Oh, did she?  I heard she lost it a little bit.  Oh, man, I want to hear that.  I can get the audio.  Why to his father?  I don't know.  Well, it's kind of a, you know.  Because they wanted everyone to cry, I guess.  But is he playing?  So he threw the first pitch out to his father.  But was his dad sick, or is he?  No, his dad's just there.  I want to throw out the first pitch at a Mets game to my father. 
[01:08:30]  He literally threw it to his father.  It wasn't like, this first pitch I'm throwing out for my father.  No, his father was at...  No, yeah, he caught it.  His dad caught it.  But why?  Is his dad an ex-ball player?  I don't know.  Or did he dream it would be it?  I don't know.  I think it was more the fact that this is Jorge's first season that he's not on the Yankees,  so he's throwing out the first pitch.  Is it on YouTube?  I can try and find it, but I'd rather get it in the back, because most likely on YouTube  it's not going to be the radio.  I heard Waldman lost her mind over it.  She was very emotional.  I'll get it for later.  Very emotional.  Goodness gracious. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, Andy Pettit knew.  Posada knew, too, because he threw it.  Oof.  Two bad knees and a dream to become obnoxious when I talk.  Oh, and the other thing with the Yankees, I guess Tim Tebow got booed last night.  Why are they booing him?  I don't know.  They've had enough of him.  They showed him.  Oh, New York.  He was hanging with Dwayne Wade.  Yeah, and Dwayne Wade, they showed them both on the scoreboard, and Dwayne Wade got a little 
[01:09:30]  booze, but then he turned around his cap, and it was a Yankee hat, so people started  cheering.  Nice.  And then they showed Tim Tebow, and nothing helped.  He just got really booed.  Wait, do we have that audio?  I don't, because it was reports from...  All right, if we could find it, I would love to hear that.  Poor Tim Tebow.  It wasn't like on TV or anything.  You think he could handle the pressure?  No.  No.  But Jets fans are going to be cheering for Tebow.  They're going to.  But they're going to do it in a fucked up way. 
[01:10:00]  When Sanchez is out there for that first game, they're going to be chanting Tebow,  I think.  Everyone's sick of Tebow and his God talk.  We get it.  Really?  Not everyone.  Someone spent, what was it?  A hundred grand.  A hundred grand to meet him.  That's fine.  What?  A little meet and greet with Tim Tebow cost...  What the fuck is going to do that?  Cost a couple people a hundred grand.  It's crazy.  You get to spend the day with him.  Oh, boy.  Boy, that's got to be a fucking blast.  Oh, yeah.  Chelsea again?  Yes!  I saw it show when I got to town.  Oh, boy. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, boy.  How was it?  All right.  Great.  You want to hear a douchey home run call while we try to find some of this other stuff?  All right.  Is someone back there getting it?  Will they hear us?  Getting what?  The audio we're looking for?  Have you seen Brokeback, Tebow?  He's sitting at his house.  Well, I'm going to get the Waldman stuff once in a minute.  Susan Waldman!  Have someone back there do it now?  We don't have anybody back there.  Oh, shit.  Where's Sam?  Sam's doing something with our good friend Kenny.  Sam Wise.  What is that?  Some production.  Oh.  I don't know.  Mystery.  Intrigue.  Oh.  I'll have it after Rashad. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  No worries.  It's all good.  As long as we have it before the 10 o'clock.  John Sterling.  Douchey home run call.  It's that time of year again.  Brand new one.  Is it a mistake?  I didn't hear this one.  Okay.  I have not either.  So we're about to hear it together.  It's not good.  Right.  2-1.  Swung on and driven a deep right field.  Fair.  It's gone.  It is high.  It is far.  And it is gone.  Oh, did he hit that one.  A way up and away.  Oh.  Raul be seeing you in the right field seats. 
[01:11:30]  Raul.  So cool.  A two-run home run.  And the Yankees have blown it open again.  They have an 11-5 lead.  Can you please stop it?  Raul.  Just stop it already.  Raul be seeing you?  That was for Raul Abanez.  Yeah.  But then he did it again.  Raul.  I said cool, though.  Be cool.  Raul, so cool.  That's good.  Just stop it.  Stop it.  That's just terrible.  Raul, I'm a fool.  And didn't it sound good before that?  He just called it as he saw it?  Raul. 
[01:12:00]  He's a good announcer up until that point.  Dude, he's great.  And then he just stinks.  I've never had anybody go great to stinks so fucking fast.  He has two modes.  Great and stink.  There's no fucking average.  There's no mediocre.  Wow.  We did our music break, and we forgot to mention that.  It's official.  Guns N' Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the Beastie Boys were all inducted into the Rock  and Roll Hall of Fame Saturday night. 
[01:12:30]  What's his name show up?  Did Izzy show up, too?  No.  Izzy did not show up.  Why did Izzy show up?  He's a very private guy.  He's not into that whole thing.  He didn't do it out of disrespect.  He posted something on Duff's blog, I think, just saying, you know, like, I'm honored and  this and that.  But it's just not his thing.  You know what?  Why don't you just show up?  I don't get that at all.  Oh, it's kind of rock and roll-ish.  Because they really mean it.  There's other guys who will do that just to be, like, kind of posers.  But I think the guys from Guns N' Roses are the real deal when it comes to that shit. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, he's not doing it to be a dick.  Like, he didn't take the axle route saying, like, oh, I know I'm not wanted there, so  I'm not going to show up.  Like, he's just a very private guy from what I understand.  He shies away from the cameras and all that kind of stuff.  Did he get fat or something?  No.  The latest picture I saw, he looks fine.  How do you not show up?  Well, why don't you show up for your band?  Like, I don't.  It's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I don't know.  If it gets as much respect as it should.  That's what he looks like? 
[01:13:30]  Is he looks like that now?  Yeah.  He looks great.  He looks like just a clean-cut businessman.  He's just a normal guy.  He looks like a business guy on the weekends, you know, picking up the guitar and playing  a little.  You'd never think that guy was in Guns N' Roses.  What did he used to look like?  I don't even remember what he looks like.  Yeah, okay.  That's what I thought.  That's the same fucking guy?  Holy fuck, is that weird.  He looks younger than when he was in Guns N' Roses.  Oh, right.  That guy.  He got sober, I think.  Yes.  He's one of the sober guys in Guns N' Roses. 
[01:14:00]  He, um...  I mean, I know Duff is, and I think he is.  I don't know if Axel is or not.  Adler is now.  Hopefully still.  Nah, with the Adler.  Is he back and forth?  Nah, with the Adler.  No, really?  Nah, he's got his fucking problems.  He seems to be very happy.  I think he was the happiest one.  Three out of the five show up.  You're all alive!  First of all, there's a lot of money to be made.  If they're still splitting the money, because the greatest hits records after these things,  they must hate each other to turn down the amount of money they would make on a GNR fucking 
[01:14:30]  reunion tour.  I don't think they hate each other.  I think it's strictly Axel.  It's mostly Slash and Axel.  Because Duff's played with Axel, Izzy's played with Axel.  Axel doesn't want anything to do with Steven Adler, because Steven Adler just, like, wants  the reunion so bad that he, you know, begs and begs and begs, and I don't think Axel  trusts him enough to do it, because he let them down so bad with his drugs.  Did he?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But what about fucking, uh, so Slash and Axel, Axel just hates Slash. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  And these guys used to, like, live together on each other's couches.  Yeah, but they all, they played together.  There was a time they were living out of a storage unit, because they had no money, and  now it comes down to this.  That's Slash autobiography.  If you haven't read it, it's...  I'm halfway through that, and I stopped when I got out of it.  It's great, really.  I did like it.  Why'd you stop?  I don't remember.  I probably got to start out of it.  That one's really good.  Really good.  I liked what I read.  Yeah.  Why is Cosby wearing a hoodie, and why does he look really old all of a sudden?  Where's Cosby? 
[01:15:30]  He was just on the CNN.  Oh.  I guess he's talking about the Trayvon Martin case?  Well, he said it wasn't race, it was guns.  The story's...  Really?  The important part of the story is not race.  That's silly.  Can we have that audio?  I would love to hear Cosby's take on this.  You want it?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  He is just bizarre these days.  Guns, not race, real issue in Trayvon Martin case.  It's an eyeball that he's got, like, really weird.  That one eyeball of his is fucking...  A little lazy?  Oh, man.  He used to jog in Central Park all the time, and I never bothered him. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah?  He would shuffle along.  I don't know if you would call it jogging.  He would just shuffle.  Shuffle off?  Yeah.  And he would always go the opposite way of everyone else.  So that's why he knew, you know, it was...  Really?  No, the other one is even worse.  That one, like, the eyelid is, like, hanging halfway down.  I told you I went to see him with my ex just to see him once live at the Borgata.  Was it great?  Yeah.  Well, I had met him here when Ronnie was going to interview him.  There was a technical glitch.  So Steve Lee just walked me and introduced me. 
[01:16:30]  We talked for a few minutes about being a comic and stuff.  So I went to get my picture signed at the Borgata.  I'm like, I wanted to see him.  So before the show, they bring us back and they go, there's a comedian.  Jim wants to say hello.  And they just, he goes, okay.  And they bring me and my ex into his dressing room.  And he's sitting on the sofa and he receives us.  And he sits us in his dressing room.  And we're just talking to him.  And we talk about comedy.  And I'm asking about the audiences and stuff.  And then he has other guests come.  So I'm like, well, thank you, mister.  He goes, stay, stay.  Because he liked it.  There was a, because he didn't know the other people.  They were business people. 
[01:17:00]  Oh.  So I think he just wanted another guy, just a comic there to, you know.  So who did he get?  Well, we got somebody.  Somebody else.  I had to leave and go home.  I was sad.  But he was, he was very fucking nice.  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  At least you didn't get one of those experiences where, you know, kind of a iconic guy is a  douchebag.  But I think, yeah.  I'm being told we have to take this phone call from Jennifer.  Jennifer, go ahead.  Hey, I just had to call in, because you guys are idiots.  That's right. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  Why?  Thank you.  Um, Guns N' Roses was just on tour in New York.  Oh.  Like, they played at Terminal 5 and other small venues.  Oh, shit.  No.  So they are all together performing, because Jimmy said there's a lot of money to be made  if they get together, the original band.  And you're telling us they're doing just that.  That's different.  We are idiots.  You know, we're idiots.  We should know this stuff.  Why wouldn't we have the proper information?  But they could do, like, stuff like, they could probably do 70,000 seats. 
[01:18:00]  Why are they doing small venues?  It was supposed to be, like, this intimate thing.  It was pretty good, actually.  Who was playing guitar for them?  It was all, like, the original guys.  I don't know.  Oh.  Oh.  We really are stupid motherfuckers.  Now, have you seen Guns N' Roses before?  How old a gal are you?  I'm old.  And I hadn't seen them before.  And I was happy that way.  Oh.  And had you seen, and how is the, how is Stephen Adler on drums, the original drummer?  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  I don't know.  Is he dead?  No.  Well, you just saw him, didn't you?  You said that Guns N' Roses is performing.  And it's all the original people.  And it's all the original people.  That's what I was told.  Oh.  Who told you that?  The guys I was with.  The guy who sold you the tickets?  Yeah.  The guy that was trying to get laid.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, once in a lifetime.  How do you make it through your day?  I just need to know.  What do you do?  Being this stupid.  Wait, I called us stupid.  How do you make it through?  One day being this stupid.  She called us stupid. 
[01:19:00]  Please.  Can I follow you around with a camera?  This would be an amazing social experiment.  How does Jennifer, with her stupidity, get through one lousy day on this earth?  Yeah, it's amazing.  Do you accidentally shovel food into your ears and wonder why you're still hungry?  Give me to follow me through the day.  Do you understand something that we're getting at here?  You're getting a lesser Guns N' Roses right now.  The real money is if the entire fucking original lineup gets back together and there's offers for just that. 
[01:19:30]  It's only Axl right now and newer band members.  It's Axl and a bunch of guys he got together.  You didn't see Slash?  Yeah, but in return to that, then I got to go to concerts I wanted to go to.  Yeah, but do you understand something?  You're called to call us idiots because the Guns N' Roses is playing around New York when it isn't Guns N' Roses.  You want to see an idiot?  Jennifer, you want to see an idiot?  It's Axl.  Not Slash.  Jennifer, you want to see an idiot?  Not really. 
[01:20:00]  I don't know.  I was going to tell you to look in the mirror.  I know.  I know.  All right.  You're kind of stupid.  I got to go.  All right, Jennifer.  Cool.  Stupid Jennifer.  I hope it's an open elevator shaft she has to step into.  Listen, Rashad Evans has already checked in, so we should go to break right now.  Oh.  We're going to have Rashad in next.  That is fucking great, and we should have promoted this.  He will be fighting Jon Jones for the belt, UFC 145, Saturday in Atlanta, 10 o'clock.  I'm guessing that the venue is probably sold out.  So let's go. 
[01:20:30]  I can't.  If I wasn't.  Cancel Cincinnati.  We'll get a little playing thing together, and we'll go nice.  I would like to very much.  Call up Dana White.  He'll set us up.  We're going to get back to the Cosby thing, but we've got to take a break because Rashad  Evans is here, and he's fighting for the fucking belt.  God, this is cool.  We'll talk to him next.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPNN 3 Show.  Let's do this.  Rashad Evans, man.  Wow. 
[01:21:00]  Huge fight this weekend.  A lot of excitement for this, huh?  Jon Jones and Rashad Evans.  Oh, hell yeah.  Fighting for the heavyweight title.  Light heavyweight.  Light heavyweight.  Excuse me.  You're right, Jimmy.  In the UFC.  Oh, it's going to be huge.  Hey, Rashad.  Oh, that's Sal.  Oh.  Hey, hey, hey.  I thought.  Ah.  Rashad Evans.  Walking in.  There he is.  Welcome back to the show, sir.  How you doing, man?  Wow, he's got his game face on.  Yeah.  This is a different Rashad Evans than last time.  You got your game face on. 
[01:21:30]  Game face came on already?  I think so.  Well, you know, it's time.  Game time.  You guys always scare me fight week.  It's always frightening to interview the fighters on fight week because it really is different  than the happy-go-lucky guy you get a month out.  I mean, you just never know what's going to set us off.  You know, we've been in the gym.  Right.  For the last two months training until it's, you know, the fight.  So, you never know when it's going to come out.  How you feeling?  That's frightening.  You ready?  Yeah, I feel good.  I feel good.  You know, ready as I'm going to be.  You know, training for a while and I feel good. 
[01:22:00]  I feel confident and excited to fight.  Yeah, people are talking about this one.  This is a big fight, man.  This is one I'm working.  If I wasn't working, I would fly to Atlanta for.  I'm so irritated that I can't go to this fight.  Call in to work.  I can't.  It's one of the few things I can't get out of doing is this week.  I'm so miserable that I can't.  I was in Atlanta and I saw the sign that they were doing the fight there.  I was so pissed off that I can't go.  You know, people are saying that you're the one guy, it seems, that can beat Jon Jones. 
[01:22:30]  Not that he's unbeatable, but just the way he looks really good as of late.  How do you feel?  I mean, you know, I feel like, you know, I definitely feel like I'm the guy to do it.  But, you know, it's always like that.  You know, when somebody comes on and looking really good and looking really hot, no one  sees that they can get beat and, you know, they're touted as unbeatable until they get  beat.  So, I'm not saying I'm the only guy that can do it.  I know I'm going to do it.  But, you know, I don't buy into all of that, the hype around people. 
[01:23:00]  I mean, you know, it's definitely deserved hype and he's definitely done his thing and  may accomplish some great things.  But at the same time, you know, nobody is supreme to anybody, you know.  We all have our flaws.  It seems like whenever you think there's a fighter that can't be beaten, somebody kicks  the shit out of him.  Like, at one point, Lesnar looked like he was unbeatable.  Right.  You know, when I first started watching, I thought, like, Liddell couldn't be beaten.  Right.  Liddell couldn't be beat.  Fedor couldn't beat.  GSP couldn't be beat. 
[01:23:30]  You know, a lot of people can never get beat until they get beat and then they get beat.  It's like, oh, I guess they can lose too.  So, you're not scared of him at all?  No.  These guys don't know that word.  There's nothing to be scared of.  You know, like, do I get afraid when I have to fight sometimes?  Yeah, but it's a mixture of emotions.  You know, I have fear.  I have, you know, anxiety.  I have excitement.  I have all these different emotions that come at me.  But I never get to the point where I'm just, like, afraid of somebody. 
[01:24:00]  You know what I mean?  The worst that can happen is you can lose.  I mean, you can get embarrassed doing it.  But at least you don't remember it.  Did you patch up your problems with Jon Jones before the fight to keep it all nice?  No.  I think we got to.  Imagine they sit down and talk before the fight.  No, we have therapy session scheduled.  We got a therapy session scheduled Saturday.  Well, you guys used to be friends, right? 
[01:24:30]  And what happened?  You know, we had, I guess, a pretty good, you know, teammate relationship.  And we were building on, you know, a friendship and stuff like that.  But, you know, I think that what happened was that he just got, you know, he just let little things divide us.  And, you know, ego and being young and stupid and just, you know, feeling like he had something to prove.  Did his head get big? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was big.  It was real big.  He definitely thinks he's all, you know, he thinks he's holier than thou and all that stuff.  So do you think that he's overconfident going into this or does that, a lot of that talk and he knows that this is going to be a problem?  I honestly believe that he's a bit overconfident, you know, and his corner is too.  You know, they think that they know me because they trained me for a few years.  And, you know, it's just, you know, it's going to be exciting to see what happens. 
[01:25:30]  What did you think of the Machida fight?  Because I got, like, we had Jones in recently and he got a little bit annoyed at me because I pointed out that, but I wasn't shitting on him.  He won fairly handily.  But Machida did seem to hit him harder than he'd been hit.  Like, he seemed to catch him a couple of times with really good shots, which I don't think there's any disgrace in saying that a guy hit you.  Yeah.  I mean, Ali always talked about Henry Cooper, I think, was him.  He hit him harder than any person had ever hit him.  Yeah.  I thought it was a good fight.  I thought Machida fought really well, you know, in the first round. 
[01:26:00]  And, you know, to John's credit, I thought he fought really well in that fight.  You know, he came back from losing the first round.  And to come back after you're losing is pretty tough, you know, because it takes a lot of mental fortitude to be able to say, you know what, things went wrong in the first round, but this next round is my round.  So, you know, I'll give him credit for coming back and being strong and finishing the fight in dramatic fashion.  Now, Machida beat you, and then he, and then Jones beats him. 
[01:26:30]  Does that go into your head at all, or is that just one of those things where not even?  Nah, you know, the thing about it is, it's like MMA math never adds up, you know what I'm saying?  You know, you beat him or he beat him, that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win the fight.  It's just, you know, everybody's matchup is different.  And, you know, there's a lot of things that go into a fight to make a fight, you know, what it is in different styles.  It just, you know, you never know what's going to happen.  And you can go, you can see a guy who looks like trash go against somebody else and have a horrible fight. 
[01:27:00]  But then you can see him go against, like, a guy who's supposed to be, like, the best and, like, you know, dang near beat him if not beat him.  It's just the way it happens.  Are you surprised that Lesnar went back to wrestling after that overhand fight?  No, I'm not surprised.  I figured he would.  I mean, I think it's a smart move, you know.  I think it's a smart move.  These heavyweights now, they're vicious, you know.  These guys, Lesnar came in a good time.  And, you know, not to take anything away from him, he definitely put in some work and beat some good guys.  But to be a heavyweight now in the UFC, you've got to be willing to stand and bang and be a good wrestler. 
[01:27:30]  And you have to be, you know, tough on all aspects of the fight game.  It looked like Overeem was aiming for the surgery when he kicked him.  It's like, that's the thing.  That's just not nice.  Why would you do that?  Let him heal.  It's the worst body shot I've ever seen thrown at a person.  He's just hitting the scar.  Yeah, he wasn't trying to be nice in that one.  He wasn't trying to be nice in that one.  I mean, at least he did it pretty humane, you know what I'm saying?  He wasn't, he didn't go in there and try to knock his head clean off. 
[01:28:00]  He just, you know, went for the body, attacked the body, and then systematically broke him down from there.  Yeah, but I was saying to people, he looked almost like a movie bad guy.  Like, after he won, he made, like, the cocky, like, that's the Drago face.  Drago.  He really is a frightening guy, man, Overeem.  I didn't realize how great he was because I didn't watch a lot of Pride.  Thank you, Kenny.  Brock was the guy to beat for a while there, man.  Yeah, and then Shane Carlin kind of got to him a little bit, and it looked like, oh, Shane probably should have won that fight. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, Shane gassed out that fight, man.  I trained with Shane that camp, and he looked phenomenal in camp, and even during the fight, he looked good.  He just didn't expect to just not have the fight end after he was, you know, beating him like that in the first round.  Can that happen where you think, like, this is where I have to do it, and you literally give everything you have, and then you go back, and you're like, oh, fuck, he's still fighting.  It's the worst feeling ever.  It's like that dream you have.  It's like that dream you have where you punch a guy hard as you can, and you don't feel it.  That's what it's like.  I don't have that dream.  I've had that reality. 
[01:29:00]  You never had a dream like that before?  No, I guess that's a fighter dream, yeah.  I mean, I'm embarrassed to say, but in our world, it's like a song is ending as you're DJing, and you can't find the next song.  I also have dreams like.  Just like what you had.  I have gun dreams where, like, you can't, like, find the right ammo for the gun, or it doesn't fire right, or something like that.  So we understand.  There's a different version of that dream that everyone goes through.  I guess I think about fighting way too much.  Oh, yeah.  That's why you're good at it.  Good question coming in from Electric Dave. 
[01:29:30]  Is Anderson Silva beatable?  Can he be beat?  Yes, I think he can be beat.  You know, I think Chael Sonnen showed that he can be beat, and that's what I'm talking about.  It's like any given Saturday or any given day, anybody can lose a fight.  You know, winning a fight and losing a fight, just like, it's very thin margin.  You know what I'm saying?  And you'll never believe some of the guys who go out there and perform well and guys who go out there and consistently lose how close they are. 
[01:30:00]  You know, and it's just that little bit that either gives one or the other the edge, you know?  Why do they boo you sometimes?  Like, you're a nice guy.  Like, I mean...  We like you.  Yeah, a lot.  But I've heard them boo you.  I'm like, why would they...  Like, you're a good dude.  It's a character.  You know?  It's just...  They just boo.  They just boo the character.  I try...  See, for a while, I tried to grasp the idea of, like, why do they always boo me?  But then I watched...  I went to WrestleMania.  I went to WrestleMania, this past WrestleMania in Florida. 
[01:30:30]  And, you know, I got to learn...  I got to see a little bit how fans think, you know?  And it's just like...  You know, it's just a show for them.  It's just a show.  And it's just...  They're just characters.  Yeah.  You know, it's nothing personal to them, but it's just, you know, oh, this is the guy who everybody boos.  Okay, so I'm a boom.  Chris Jericho.  Yeah, it's just character.  I don't take it personally.  Right.  Do you watch wrestling?  Do you like wrestling?  Or do you guys watch wrestling kind of like, oh, that's cute? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, I watch it like, oh, that's cute.  But you know what?  I got a tremendous amount of respect for those guys because that's not easy.  Like, even though it was fake, I was watching it.  And they were really taking those falls.  And they were really...  Like, you have to have...  It's not an easy job to do.  And, you know, I was watching the Undertaker fight.  And that was a fight that just impressed me the most because it was like they just kept going and going and going.  And to remember all those moves and to do all of that and take all those falls, I'm like, man, the next day they have to be hurting. 
[01:31:30]  Because I did a movie one time and I did a fight scene for probably about five hours.  And then the next day I felt worse than I felt for any fight that I've done just because I snapped my neck back so many times just trying to make it look real.  And it really attacks my body.  So to do what they do is pretty tough in its own right.  In this scene, did you win the fight or lose it?  I lost the fight.  You know I had to lose a fight.  He's got to be losing.  If he's not the big star of the movie.  Yeah, I had to lose a fight.  I didn't see the movie. 
[01:32:00]  I would assume he's not the star of the movie.  So if you're not the star, you're going to lose.  Yeah, exactly.  Right?  That's like the...  Well, it depends if you're fighting the star.  It depends on who you're fighting.  I was fighting the star.  Oh, that's true.  Who is the star?  His name is Hector Njavada.  Oh, boy.  You should have won.  You should have won.  You got a bad age.  He's got a bad age.  You should have been the star of that film.  He's called Unrivaled.  Yeah.  Hey, we got a comment coming in from Ireland.  Chipstick writes, why does he always call Jon Jones fake? 
[01:32:30]  In my opinion, I feel like Jon Jones is fake.  You know, the way I know Jon to be and the way he comes across and the way he is is fake.  And I would disclose more, but you know what?  It's not really my place to say.  And, you know, when it comes out, that's all I can just say.  It's like, hey.  My guess would be something along the lines of when you're working with a guy for a long time,  sometimes people will publicly maybe come off like they're better guys than they are 
[01:33:00]  or nicer guys than they are or more wholesome guys than they are.  And you're just no real man.  That's exactly it in a nutshell.  And, you know, I'm not a perfect person, so I don't want to put nobody's stuff out there  because I've got enough stuff that, you know, that I do or something like that.  But it's just at least I'm me.  You know, I'm real.  Do you think he, it seemed like he copied you a little bit or you said that you think he took some of the,  like the way you get into the ring and certain things?  Yeah, he bit my style.  He bit my style a little bit.  But, you know, I guess, you know, it's a form of flattery.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:33:30]  And imitation is one of the biggest forms of flattery, so I can't, I can't really hate him too much for that.  I guess he just recognized greatness.  Humble.  Like that.  What?  What?  What?  People feeding you questions?  Saying, yeah, you ask, go be.  No, I'm not asking Rashad Evans fight week.  Yeah, go ahead.  About a rumor?  Nah.  What's the rumor?  Seriously?  Yeah.  The guy, Chipstick, says that Jon Jones might have had a little thing with your wife or something. 
[01:34:00]  What?  Yeah.  Are you out of your mind?  I didn't want to say it.  But you did.  What was it?  But you did.  Is there, oh boy.  Is that true?  He's saying it.  He's giving me the evil look.  Nah, I mean.  I'm going to get my ass kicked.  Yeah, well, rightly so.  Don't kill the messenger?  Nah.  Messenger, the guy, everyone.  I mean, I'm divorced now, but it was totally un-John Jones related.  Besides.  That's a battle you never want to get into. 
[01:34:30]  My wife is not John Jones type, believe me.  All right.  We stopped breathing for a second.  I really, I literally couldn't look at Rashad because I didn't ask it, but I was just trying  to remember you as I knew you.  He said, freaking say it.  Jesus.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You know what it is?  I mean, listen, I never get mad what somebody says behind a screen.  I mean, come on, most of these people, if they see me, they'd be trying to, like.  They would never say it to me.  Oh, yeah.  Hell no.  They'd be licking my balls.  Now, do you, uh, do you take that type of stuff to heart, like, not, I'm not going 
[01:35:00]  to say commentator criticism, because, like, you know, Rogan is a respected guy, but I  mean, like, bloggers and guys like that who, uh, who say things, because it's like,  uh, oh my God, uh, Rampage got really annoyed at Rogan recently, which I was surprised  at.  Does that, does that get to you at all?  You know, it's weird, it's like, um, sometimes it will get to me, but then I remember, I'm  like, wait a minute, like, it really doesn't matter, like, sometimes when people say things  to me, it doesn't, it doesn't matter to me, because I can't allow somebody's opinion 
[01:35:30]  of me to make up who I really am, so when I find myself getting into that, I need to  sit back and just, like, really reflect and be like, dude, this, these people are irrelevant,  you know what I'm saying, it's just that if I find myself building, uh, who I am around  what anybody says, then I become worthless in a sense, because if I allow them to say  something to me or make me in any kind of way, then I allow them to take that away from  me, so I can't allow anybody to make me or break me, so I just don't give any validation 
[01:36:00]  to what anybody has to say when it comes to that.  How do you push out being afraid?  Like, I, I, you know, we all get nervous when we're doing what we're doing, but how do  you push that out in a fighting situation, because it's, I mean, you've got to be a human  being and know that anything can happen with a guy who's a professional fighter.  How do you get rid of that and focus and actually use your ability?  One of my biggest problems was trying to push, push it away, not want to feel the feeling,  and what happened is I would, I would fight myself, and that was a scary feeling, because  I'm just like, you know, I would say I'm not supposed to feel like this, I'm not supposed 
[01:36:30]  to feel like this, but I come to accept it.  I know I'm going to be afraid.  I know that that's what happens when I got to fight.  So instead of saying to myself that I'm not supposed to feel like that, I say, this  is exactly how I'm supposed to feel.  If I didn't feel like this, then I wouldn't want, then I wouldn't be fast.  If I didn't feel like this, then I wouldn't hit hard.  If I didn't feel like this, then I wouldn't be ready.  So then I changed something that was negative into something that is positive.  And then I look forward to feeling that way, because that means I'm ready to fight. 
[01:37:00]  See, he has a different response to fight or flight, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Where you are, your flight is pretty much getting on a plane.  You need to get this quickly away.  I mean, but fear is like that in life, because one thing that we hate more than anything is  the fact that we hate, the biggest fear is uncertainty and the loss of control.  I hate a fist in the face.  That's pretty much where the fear of fighting comes from.  A fist in the face.  It kind of hurts.  It makes your head go ping.  Wow, this fight on Saturday is going to be great. 
[01:37:30]  I do.  I would love to get into this beef thing, but...  Will it come out eventually?  Will it come out?  Oh, because you guys, we've had Jon Jones in, we've had you in, you guys kind of hinted  some real shit that went on, but no one really wants to say, no one wants to be the first  one to say it, I guess.  Man, listen, I'm like, I'm not just...  Because you guys used to be really close for a while there.  Yeah, I mean, I know enough about the guy.  I know enough about him.  See, that's what I mean. 
[01:38:00]  It's very just...  I mean, I'm not a whistleblower, you know what I'm saying?  Is part of it, let me...  Fair enough, Rashad.  Is part of it that when you have to fight somebody that you liked at one point or were  close to, that any, like, minor things that became negative, you have to keep there because  this way it's not hard to fight a guy that you liked?  Yeah, I guess so.  Like, you know, whenever I step into the cage, honestly, I just, I'm ready to fight whoever,  you know, when it comes down to it. 
[01:38:30]  And that's one thing I'm learning about myself.  And it would be harder if we were really good friends as far as, you know, because  sometimes, like, when you get ready to fight somebody, there's kind of a certain energy  around.  So, if I had this energy, like, oh, we're cool, we're cool, then when I got into the  fight, I'll still be, like, in play mode.  But now that I don't like him, I know from, like, the minute I see him that it's, like...  It's going to be on.  Yeah, it's going to be on.  Like, it's going to be hard to be like, man, I just want to punch him in his face because  that's all I've been thinking about, you know?  So, hey, Rashad, so we're, what, five days out? 
[01:39:00]  What do you do the week of a big fight?  Obviously, the training's behind you.  You're done with the gym.  Do you even go to the gym at all and just do some light workouts or you're just totally  done?  I go just to rev the engine up a little bit and to tease it a little bit, you know?  Because my mind and my body's been training for the last eight weeks and it's been becoming  addicted to the fight, you know?  So, I pull it back a little bit and just kind of tease it and then get my mind excited about  it and feel like I need to do something. 
[01:39:30]  Like, I want to do it.  So, when I get ready to fight, like, I just can't even control it and I just really want  to, like, let loose.  And what else are you going to do?  Just lay around all week?  Yeah, lay around, but not too much because you don't want to become, like, lazy.  You just want to just give it a...  You want Saturday to be today, right?  Yeah, you want to give it a taste, a little bit of a taste every single day, even if it's  just thinking about it, visualizing, you want to give it a little bit of taste.  Right.  Do you tell yourself that the other guy is scared, too, or the other guy is...  Because to fight for a championship fight, you can't not be nervous. 
[01:40:00]  No matter who you are or what the belt is, you can't not be nervous.  Do you try to say, like, the way I'm feeling, he has to be feeling this way on some level?  You know, I try not to think about what the other guy is feeling too much because, you  know, managing my own emotions is enough.  So I just really just focus on how I feel and just, I know the guy across the cage is  probably feeling the same way I do.  And everybody handles it differently.  You know, everybody handles it differently.  And like, I used to work in a hospital and I used to see a lot of dead bodies and everybody 
[01:40:30]  would handle death differently.  Some people would be joking around and laughing.  Some people would be very somber, you know, but everybody had a different personality when  it comes to dealing with that situation.  What would you do?  I was just, I was very, I was very, no, I was very like contemplative about it.  Like some people would be like, oh man, you'll never believe this is fucking dumb.  That's dead.  And then they're like, you know, they're like, you know, had a guy come in and, you know,  he'd be all messed up and he would just like make a joke out of it. 
[01:41:00]  I'm just like, man, that was a live person.  Right.  What would, what, excuse me, what was your job at the hospital?  I worked security guard, but I worked the night shift and after 5 p.m. the pathologist  went home.  So my job was to put bodies in and out, take them, you know, put them in and take them  out the morgue and do, you know, you know, when, when somebody dies, they have to do a  visual.  So, so people would identify the body and I had to be there for like autopsies if there's  a crime or something that was committed. 
[01:41:30]  Did you ever, you ever try and move on one?  I mean, just to practice.  Like, let me see how I can make this a little, oh my God.  Why in the middle of the night he's just trying to move like that?  Like, he must have fallen down 10 flights of steps.  Every bone is broken.  It was disturbing enough when you had to pick up somebody and their back is still warm.  Whoa.  And then you got to put them into the cold freezing and you're like, wow.  It's just, and they're still loose, you know, it's kind of like, they feel like they shouldn't 
[01:42:00]  be, like they should be alive.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a pretty heavy job, man.  That is a heavy job.  So I don't, at first it was really hard to sleep, but then after a while, I just kind  of, it didn't even affect me anymore.  And I would just be in the middle of eating and be like, oh, Rashad, you have a room 10.  And then I'd go down and do it and then come back upstairs and eat like nothing happened.  Wow.  I bet you missed that job.  I do miss some aspects.  It was really fun though.  People aren't yapping back at you all the time.  You know, it's different.  No dumb questions.  It's different.  So how long did you do that? 
[01:42:30]  I did it for like three years.  Wow.  Well, that's a lot.  I guess that does something to you.  If you can handle being around bodies like that, I mean, that has to do a certain thing  to your mentality that a lot of people probably couldn't handle.  Yeah.  It's a mess.  Like sometimes like I would see after I've been there for a while, it would just, I would  just be totally numb to it.  But then after a while I would see something and it'd kind of be like, it'd kind of bring  me back to like, dang, this is, you know, it's, this is real.  And, um, cause like one thing I learned is that people die doing the dumbest thing. 
[01:43:00]  They, I mean, you would never believe how, how fragile human life is and how people die  just like doing stuff.  And I'm just like, wow.  You got an example from when you worked there?  Oh man.  One.  Like, what would you see that you'd go like, oh, what a waste doing that?  What a dumb mistake that was.  Well, one time this guy got, came in, uh, uh, for the last three weeks, every single  time he came in, he got shot.  He got shot three times and he would never tell who did it.  So then finally he came in and he was dead. 
[01:43:30]  But I'm just like, what an idiot.  Why didn't you just tell who was shooting him?  The same guy kept shooting him.  The same guy kept shooting him.  Holy shit.  I think after the second time, you probably should tell someone.  Yeah.  There's a code and all, but geez, let's be real.  I understand the code.  Give him the first one.  After two, throw him the first one and then second time, shame on you.  And who was that awful assassin?  Three times.  Those three shot McGillica.  I think, I think he like owed him money or something like that.  And that's probably what happened. 
[01:44:00]  He was probably, you know, just, uh, scaring him, trying to get his money.  And then afterwards he just probably figured he didn't get it, man.  So he probably killed him.  Did any of them affect you?  I'm sorry.  No, no, go, go, go.  Did any of them affect you more?  Like, did you see that, that, that kind of lasted with you, uh, for whatever reason?  Yeah.  I remember working, uh, you know, cause part of my job was to, um, like if somebody came  in for a trauma, they would, uh, I would have to come and get their belongings and put  them in his, uh, the office.  And, uh, I came in one time and this guy, he got stabbed.  It was like a level three trauma, which is not that serious. 
[01:44:30]  He got stabbed in the stomach by his girlfriend and, uh, I'm collecting his belongings.  And then the doctor, the ER doctor came in and she checked him over and he's like, Oh yeah,  you're fine.  You know, you should be okay.  We're going to stitch you up and stuff like that.  And he's like, man, I don't, I heard him talking to the nurse.  He's like, man, I just, I don't feel right.  I just feel like, uh, I feel like I'm slipping.  I feel like I'm falling.  Like I'm going somewhere.  I don't feel right.  I just don't, I don't feel right.  And he kept saying it over and over again.  He's like, no, no, you're fine.  The doctor checked you over, but I'll have her come back in.  He just like kept saying, he's like, man, I just don't feel right. 
[01:45:00]  I feel like I'm falling.  And then, uh, two hours later, I'm putting this guy into the morgue.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened was, I guess he got, he got nicked and had a little internal bleeding that they  didn't see.  And then, uh, he started to, you know, die and they took him down to surgery and it was  too late.  But that, that falling feeling is probably him.  Just his blood loss, right?  I don't know.  He just felt like he was falling.  He felt like he was going somewhere.  He said it.  Oh man.  That's fucked up.  People are saying you're so much more humble than, uh, John Jones. 
[01:45:30]  I mean, I, I feel like I am, but two very different personalities.  Yeah.  Fighting Saturday.  And I like John too.  I mean, we've had him in.  He's a nice guy.  He's a fun guest.  Like I genuinely like him too.  I mean, he's, he's, he's a bit cocky.  Let's be honest with each other.  Yeah.  But I mean, uh, yeah, fair enough.  He is.  Um, but I mean, this time's where I'm cocky and I'm a, I'm a nobody who's, I've been doing  Weight Watchers points.  I mean, I'm sure you notice.  Doesn't he look good, Rashad?  Yeah, he does look good.  Looks good, right?  Yeah.  But, uh, I remember I said, so last time I saw you had a, an injury, uh, what was the 
[01:46:00]  last fight you, you, you had where you, you got hurt?  I saw you backstage and you had that or behind in the arena.  Oh, and I saw my shoulder.  Um, your, your, your, your arm was in a sling.  Oh, I broke my hand after the Tito fight.  Yeah.  Oh, it was the Tito Ortiz fight that you broke your hand.  Is that, have you fought since then or no?  Yeah.  I fought, uh, January 28th.  Oh, Phil Davis.  Okay.  What was your worst injury?  Oh man, it's always tough to answer.  I'm sorry.  Nah, it's all right.  Training's over.  So, uh, I broke my hand. 
[01:46:30]  That's probably the worst injury I had.  Did you know you broke him when you hit him?  You know what?  Um, no, I would say my MCL injury.  I injured my MCL that took me out of the fight with Shogun last year.  So that was probably my worst injury.  Wait, during the fight?  You, you, that way you, that way you lost to him?  I never lost to Shogun.  Hmm.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm thinking of, uh, of the Layout of the Tito.  Okay.  That's right.  Yeah.  Shogun, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't get the tough fight, uh, Shogun, but I, I heard it in training and practice.  Were you happy you avoided that fight?  Did you ever get hurt? 
[01:47:00]  Did you ever, like, get hurt?  Who was I?  Were you scared?  No, no, no.  But, I mean, it's interesting to me, because, like, I, for me, like, when I first started  doing stand-up, 1990, if a gig got canceled, I was happy.  Because, like, I was so scared.  So was the crowd.  That scared thing again.  These guys aren't scared.  It's still interesting to me that, you know.  No, I just, I never had a fight where something happened and didn't end up going through, and  I was like, yes, I don't got to fight.  Right.  I was like, man, you know, I'll, I mean, I like, I like to fight. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, it is stressful.  It is hard at times, but I like to fight.  You know, I got, I got one of my teammates who always would, uh, he always, he always  texts me, or he'll, he'll come up to me before I leave, and he'll be like, hey, hey,  if you don't want to do it, I'll do it, man.  Are you scared?  And he, like, always, like, teased me and busts my balls, saying I'm scared.  I'm like, man, what are you talking about?  I'm not scared.  He says, no, I'll fight him for you.  Are you scared, though?  I'm like, no, I'm not scared.  What are you talking about?  I'm not scared.  But he does just kind of get a rise out of me.  What, what knocks that out of you in a fight? 
[01:48:00]  Is it the first shot, or is it when you touch gloves, or is it, like, when, like, what actually  puts you in fight mode as opposed to?  Showtime.  Yeah.  Um, for me, it's like, when I walk out there, I'm ready to fight, you know, because it's just  like in the back room, I'm hitting mitts, and then I'm hearing everything going on,  and then I'm just, like, mentally just, you know, just in my mind, just, you know,  telling myself I'm going to, you know, whoop this dude's ass, and then I get excited and  revved up, and then I can't, I just, I just go into that zone. 
[01:48:30]  Can I go back to the, uh, remember that chipstick guy?  Oh, yeah.  This is good.  I swear.  Oh, boy.  I hate, I hate interviewing UFC fighters, because at any moment they could kill us.  Yeah.  So you've got to be really careful.  That he gets so much, so could most musicians.  But I feel like, but I feel like I have to say this, because I felt bad when he, he asked  about that rumor, but he goes, he writes, oh, you misread my last thing.  No, I didn't.  I read it word for word.  What he meant to say was, did John Jones fuck around on his own wife?  Oh, that's different. 
[01:49:00]  Are you, that's, that's completely different.  Yeah.  That's my fucking jaw.  Those are, those are big differences.  So I had to bring it back to that point, because obviously the guy, I swear to God,  I read it word for word.  Oh.  But he says, I misread.  No, I don't think so.  Oh, you want me to answer that question?  If you want to.  I mean, if you want to.  Honestly, I don't, I don't know what John Jones does when it, when it comes to his personal  information.  But at least we got the real question out there.  Yeah, because that was really, I don't get uncomfortable that easily.  Jimmy's eyes got so big, he's looking at me, I'm like, what?  He told me to read it. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, but I was like, it's easy to ask that from across the console.  Oh, you don't think you can jump?  You have a co-worker or a friend.  He would have to beat the shit out of you and Ann before he got to me, but he would  get to me.  No, we would step aside.  We wouldn't try to say, hey, what are you doing?  Absolutely step aside.  The sidestep.  Go ahead, let me get in your way.  Please.  So how long before a fight will you not have an orgasm?  Oh, jeez.  I want to know if that's a myth.  I've heard you talk about that shit.  It's a myth, man.  It is, right? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  We feel tuckered out after we come.  Yeah.  I feel a little tuckered out.  Although sometimes I can't sleep.  That could be avoided by, you can take a nap and you'd be right back at it again.  Because it's like, the thing is you want to keep your testosterone up, right?  That's how you get it.  But at the same time, you don't want to, you don't want to, they say women weaken legs  because everything that comes along with it, the emotion that comes along with it.  See, if you are so into a girl, and you know, girls are emotional.  So if you're so into them, you're subject to their mood swings. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, shit.  You don't want that.  Yeah.  So that way, if you were the girl and then all of a sudden, you know, she's like, you know,  I'm not having a good day.  I, you know, break up.  Oh, man.  Something about girls getting down, right?  Yeah, that's going to fuck you up.  So then it'll mess your whole head up.  And I've seen guys, I've seen guys that are like, like so pussy whooped when they have  a fight with their girlfriend, they can't even train.  They can't even practice.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know fighters like now that will just go in a shell if they have a situation with 
[01:51:00]  the old lady and it will just be done.  Wouldn't that make you train harder?  I would, I would train harder.  Yeah, but some people can't, some people can't do it.  I'd be all pissed off and shit.  Like for me, I train harder.  Like for me, I'm like, all right, cool.  Yeah.  It's extra motivation.  If you, when you win a big fight, do you treat yourself?  Because Jimmy treats himself after a big show.  Yeah.  If I do something.  Do you want to explain him?  Well, just the way a boy should treat himself after I have a good show.  If I, if it's something I filmed, then I just ate like a fucking pig.  I mean, I guess you do the same thing.  Yeah.  I treat myself a little bit.  You know, what do you do after a big win? 
[01:51:30]  Get a training.  Oh, you mean him.  I thought you were still asking me.  Anything special?  What's your thing after a big win?  A thing?  Do you like just fucking pig out on cheesecake?  I don't know.  I eat a lot of sweets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I eat a lot of sweets.  I just get reckless with it.  Yeah.  Like diabetic coma type sweets.  Just eat a lot of sweets, man.  I like sweets.  So that's my thing.  I don't go too crazy, though.  And what was the fight? 
[01:52:00]  We talked about the girls, too.  Like, didn't Liddell have a fight with his girlfriend like right before a fight?  I heard it was in the hotel room or something.  I think he told the story.  I don't even know.  Why would your girlfriend do that?  But I mean, like when she threw something at him, like an ashtray.  I could be wrong.  Why can't that stuff wait?  The thing about it is women are so emotional, they don't care.  Like, for them, it's never about the future.  It's all about right now.  So if it's, like for them, if they're upset right now and you piss them off right now, they  don't give a damn what you got to do in two hours.  They want to let you know how much they're upset at that specific moment. 
[01:52:30]  You speak the truth.  And they want, and you can never, and if you don't acknowledge how they're feeling, the  argument's going to go on and on.  So you have to acknowledge it.  Their best time to fight is right before you fall asleep.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That is their favorite time to start a fight.  Get it going.  And you have like six hours sleep at you.  Yeah, they don't care.  They don't care.  Have you ever had a woman start anything before?  Because I've had major things coming up the next morning on this show that my ex would  start stuff with, and I'm like, I just want the strangler. 
[01:53:00]  I'm like, well, you know who I'm interviewing.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Have you ever had that before a fight or close to fight time?  Have I ever not had that before?  I have it all the time, man.  Oh, really?  All the time.  Even with my ex now, it'll just be like something stupid.  I'm like, I'm not even answering this phone.  I'm not even reading it in Texas because I know, I already know it's going to be nothing  but drama.  So I try not to pay attention to that kind of stuff.  But I'm very good at compartmentalizing things like that. 
[01:53:30]  Because I'm used to dealing with it so much, I just don't even pay it no merit.  So now, do you believe in the stare down or no?  Does it mean anything to you how another guy looks?  Because when you look at a guy like Fedor, he's kind of like a guy.  He wouldn't really try to stare anybody down.  But then you get a guy like Rampage who gets very close to your face, which can be very  intimidating.  Does that mean anything to you?  Do you do it or no?  It all depends, you know, more than a stare down, you can kind of, you can feel the energy.  For some reason, I sound like crazy, but you can feel the energy of somebody. 
[01:54:00]  You can feel, like I can feel how confident the person is if they're putting on or if they  really, you know, feel the way they feel.  I can feel the energy just by coming close to them and looking at them or just feeling  their presence when I'm around, how they feel.  Who are you fighting that had a particularly menacing or like that type of an energy that  you're like, this guy really means business and is confident?  I'm sure they all do.  Yeah.  Machida.  Really? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  He felt hunger to me when I was like, when I stared at him, I was like, man, he feels  like he is ready.  And I just didn't, I just wasn't there.  It got to you a little bit?  Yeah, it did.  It did get to me a little bit.  You can feel it.  You can feel like when somebody's just like, you know, just really, really dialed in.  Did you know when you were going in?  Do you know when you're going in, like you feel like I'm not 100%?  Yeah, I felt it.  Like I had, like I was dreaming, like I lost.  And then like I was like, in my mind, I just didn't feel like, I didn't feel, I didn't 
[01:55:00]  feel comfortable.  And like I never lost at that point.  So I was thinking like, you know, I was like, man, is this the one I lose?  Is this the one I lose?  You know?  Is this it?  Yeah.  Is this the one?  And you just kind of feel it like something just not right.  Does it take pressure off once you lose?  Because then it's like you're still a great fighter, but you don't have to worry about  the first defeat.  Does it change anything?  Or does it just...  You know what?  That's funny.  I partied harder when I lost than when I did win.  It's probably a big relief.  Man, when I lost, man, I partied like Brad Pitt in that movie. 
[01:55:30]  He, uh, what is it with the, when he's an Irish, when he's, uh, you know, uh, begins  with an S?  Oh, uh, Snatch.  Snatch.  Yeah.  Snatch.  You know, when his mom died?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how I partied, man.  I partied hard.  I just like fell out on the floor, woke up.  I didn't know where I was.  I was like, man.  Yeah.  And then you start all over.  Yeah.  Then I woke up crying.  I lost.  I can't believe I lost.  You ever fight?  Yeah.  You ever fight with the flu or anything like that? 
[01:56:00]  Like, where you're real sick and you just can't get out of the fight, obviously?  Oh, have I fought sick before?  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Like, you had the flu or something.  No, I never fought sick, but I trained, like, when I felt like that.  Like, when I felt like, um, like I had the flu or if I was, like, really sick.  I trained like that.  How the hell do you do that?  That's hard, too, if you have to back out of a fight because of the flu.  Because everybody's like, uh, like an injury, they understand it.  Oh, my God, yeah.  But if you're sick when I fought, uh, Michael Bisping, I had, like, uh, it was, like, a 
[01:56:30]  really, really bad chest cold coming on, and it was, like, the first day of it.  And I stayed in bed all day.  I had no appetite to eat, and I had to report.  We fought in Jersey, and I had to report the fight at, like, uh, like, we had report times  when we got to get ready to go to the fight.  It was, like, at 8 p.m., and it was really late, and I slept all day, ate really little,  and I was just, like, wow.  Yeah, it was the worst, man.  You won, I don't know, you won that fight, right?  Yeah, I won a fight, but it was, like, when those fights were.  How did you get your wind, knowing you got a chest cold coming on? 
[01:57:00]  It was hard, and especially in the arena, it was the, uh, it was a hockey arena, so it  was cold, and that cold air going into my lungs felt like I had, I was breathing in razors.  Oh, my God.  What's the closest to fight time you ever had to shit?  Like, always right before.  Oh, right before?  The nervous shit?  Yeah, the body always plays the trick on me, man, and I don't even, I don't even answer.  I don't fight for that trick no more.  That's got to suck if you can't, because I hate when I have to do something, and I know  I have to, and when you're in an arena, you can't.  Oh, yeah, it's the worst.  The worst is when you have to use the bathroom when you're fighting, like, it really only 
[01:57:30]  happened, like, one time.  Like, when I fought, uh, when I fought Brad Imes, it was like, uh, to get into, to get  a contract with the UFC, um, I was so exhausted, and, uh, I had to pee, and we were going at  it so hard, and just kind of just, like...  You let it go.  Good for you.  What are you going to do?  I couldn't, I couldn't do nothing.  I couldn't do nothing about it, but I didn't even realize that I let it go, and so I was  like, I don't got to pee no more, and I was like...  Oh, man.  It wasn't, like, one moment. 
[01:58:00]  It wasn't, like, one moment, like, okay, I'm going to pee.  It's not like I was, like, sitting in a pool and decided to take a pee.  It just kind of, like...  It just kind of left me.  I didn't realize it.  And you didn't just let a little out.  You went all in.  Yeah.  I went all in, so I don't...  The whole ring smelled like asparagus.  How great is that?  Is there a moment in that fight where you can see, like, it was right after that?  Um, I...  I...  Yeah, there was a moment in the fight where I was like, I think this is where I...  What round?  It was the third round.  Okay. 
[01:58:30]  It was the third round where I was just, like, completely exhausted, and we were getting in  to it, and it was just like...  I was like, man, I don't know if I can hold it.  And there's just nothing you can do.  I guess they say you can sweat it out or whatever, but there's nothing you can do if you got to...  I piss a lot, so I always fly in the aisle.  Not to make it about me.  But I definitely...  But I can't imagine being in a situation where you can't pee and you have to be punched in the lower intestines.  Oh, man, that's...  Yeah.  That's just got to be uncomfortable.  It was very uncomfortable even trying to hold it.  Because then, like...  Usually, like, when your adrenaline's going, it's weird. 
[01:59:00]  Your body does this amazing thing where it just, like, shuts down everything that doesn't have to do with the fight.  But for some reason, I had, like, maybe a lapse of concentration where it just opened that feeling up, and I just had it.  Were you thinking about it while you fought?  I thought about it when I went to the corner, and then after the fight started again, I forgot about it.  And then next thing you know, I just...  After the fight, I didn't have that feeling at all anymore.  What part of the fight was it?  He started riding him. 
[01:59:30]  No, I mean, were you grappling?  I think...  Were you on the ground?  Yeah, I think I might have been on the ground.  I think I may have been on the ground.  I think he took me down to something like that, and I was on my back, and I don't know.  Did he ever know?  Huh?  Did he ever know?  He knows now.  That's great.  Right now, if he's listening, he's like, I knew it!  I knew he pissed on me!  Right.  I'm not in my territory.  Liddell's girlfriend broke up an hour before the fight.  Oh, an hour before the fight.  These guys know everything out there way more than we do.  It's just...  I thought they had a really nasty argument. 
[02:00:00]  It's like, I wish I would love to know what fight that was if he lost that fight.  All right, let's go to the phone and say hi to Sean.  Sean, we got Rashad Evans in studio today, of course, fighting Jon Jones Saturday.  This Saturday, and it's on pay-per-view, of course, at 10 o'clock, UFC 145.  I don't get all the pay-per-views.  I'm getting this one.  Sean, go ahead.  I don't know the whole story.  It was what Dana told.  It was like an hour before the fight.  She decided to break up with him and then decided to have this large fight where she threw an ashtray at him and everything.  I don't think he lost it, but it's just that she just decided that that hour before was the opportune time to break up with him. 
[02:00:30]  I guess you can work in your favor, right?  And Rashad, she'll give me a bicep slicer today instead of a choke.  You said a bicep slicer?  Yeah.  What is that?  I don't even know the bicep slicer.  Oh, thank God.  It doesn't sound pleasant.  I mean, is it like a figure of him?  It's a forearm between the arms with the arm bent between your legs.  Okay, okay, okay.  That doesn't sound pleasant. 
[02:01:00]  I don't like when a fighter has some move explained to him right before.  He's like, oh, yeah, I think I can pull it off.  Yeah, maybe I can try that.  What is that?  I've never heard that before.  A bicep slicer?  Bicep slicer, yeah.  I've never really heard it before either.  I've never heard it called a bicep slicer.  What have you heard it called?  I can't even remember.  It's called fuck him up?  Yeah, I don't think I would enjoy that.  It's the fuck him up move.  Let's say hi to Joe.  What do you say, Joe?  Hey, Rashad, I was wondering if you could talk about the purse for the fight 
[02:01:30]  and how you feel that correlates with how much other professional athletes are getting  because the UFC is, you know, mainstream now.  The payouts.  Yeah, the payouts?  Yeah.  So you want to know how I feel about it?  Well, I would assume he's asking you how much.  I would assume he'd want more money.  Yeah.  We all want more money.  Right, right, yeah.  Do you think the money's getting up there finally?  Yeah, I believe the money's getting up there. 
[02:02:00]  You know, the UFC does a good job of taking care of us, and, you know, they always make  sure that they, you know, they always take care of me and stuff like that.  So I think it's getting up there.  You know, one thing I'd understand is that the UFC is an organization that's really, really  building.  So it takes a lot to do that.  And right now, the money's not where it is with boxing for the most part.  But it's getting there.  It's getting better.  How about endorsements and stuff?  Do you guys have them outside of UFC, or is it just like, you know, with like clothing 
[02:02:30]  in the UFC, or is there outside stuff?  Yeah, there's a, you know, it's not, I mean, you get your sponsors and stuff like that.  So I guess that's what you mean, right?  Yeah.  Or just, like we played a Jordan commercial before, where, you know, he did like, is it  and you, Gatorade, and all these guys do different stuff.  Do you guys have that yet, or is that something that's...  Not as much.  Yeah, I don't see it as much.  Not as much, not as much.  It's just, you know, the big, you know, Fortune 500 companies, they're still coming around  to MMA. 
[02:03:00]  You know, we just now got on Fox, so for the longest time, people were waiting for the  sport to fall through and something bad to happen.  So everybody, nobody wanted to put their stamp on it, yes.  But now, with, you know, with Fox getting behind us and stuff like that, and the popularity  of the sport, I think we're going to see a lot more of those bigger companies coming  into the sport and really sponsoring these fighters.  Yeah.  It's getting there.  All right.  Well, I guess we should plug it again before we wrap up here.  UFC 145, you know, Jon Jones, Rashad Evans, it's an amazing fight. 
[02:03:30]  It's one of the, like, I'm really annoyed I can't go to it, so I'm going to try to get  it and watch it in between shows next Saturday night, 10 o'clock in Atlanta.  It's hard to pick a guy, because I like both of the guys, but I think I like you better.  I do, but I can't shit on Jon either.  With him sitting there.  No, but Jon is a nice dude.  He's been a very fun guest, too.  I like him a lot.  But Rashad, I just, I kind of want to see you win, and I almost, I hate to pick fighters,  because my record is not good.  Oh, shit.  Don't pick me.  And don't say anything.  Don't pick me. 
[02:04:00]  No, but it was better pick me.  I actually went three for three, I think, on the last one.  Nice.  So, I mean, I have a decent, recent track record.  And I guess we always try to get you to do a move.  But I'm shooting something in two weeks, so I can't do anything with my neck.  Okay.  Or my legs.  Maybe an arm punch.  I would take a punch in the left arm.  A punch in the left arm?  Yeah.  What, do you not want to do that?  Yeah, I mean, I'd punch you if you want me.  You really want to punch you?  We don't got to do anything.  I like, I wouldn't mind, though.  Okay.  But not as hard as you can. 
[02:04:30]  What do you think, I'm some kind of animal?  No, no, no.  I'm going to tighten up a little bit.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  Oh, wow.  Oh, Jimmy, that looked like it really hurt.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, that was a good one.  That was a good one.  It slipped off the side a little, so it kind of, I think it really hurt your muscle, right?  Yeah.  What little there is.  Yeah, I used to, uh. 
[02:05:00]  Why did you do that, Jimmy?  Oh, Jimmy, that's going to bruise really bad.  What percentage of that was, I know that was nowhere near full strength, but what percentage  of that was of your?  I'd probably say it was probably like 50%.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Wow, man.  That was a good 50%.  It just had a lot of weight.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a heavy punch.  It was a good one.  It was a good one.  It was a good one to the bone.  I used to, uh.  Oh!  I flexed up a little bit, even though there's nothing here.  Oh, hey, look out.  Because just to protect the bone a teeny bit, if I can, because that could be, we could  do the right one, too.  Let's do the right one.  Oh, really?  Why would you do? 
[02:05:30]  Why not?  Here we go.  Oh, man.  What is wrong with Jimmy?  Oh, this is all being video, so, yeah.  There's a technique to try to throw it.  It's better to get him or not ready, because then that way you can get that.  I know the bone.  Yeah.  Oh, right, right.  Then he's not flexed up.  He's not flexed up.  So, yeah.  I used to have this, uh.  Oh, shit.  My friend's uncle, Uncle Billy, used to always give Charlie Horse a scene, like, yeah!  What are you doing?  Guess who won the race? 
[02:06:00]  Who?  Boom!  Charlie!  And he won it by hair!  Yeah!  And he was, like, the biggest bully.  He was the biggest bully, man, so.  What an asshole.  Yes, he was.  Wow, man.  But he specialized in getting you right with Charlie Horse all the time.  Yeah, I've learned to flex up.  Oh, that muscle just friggin' knots up on you like that.  He used to get me in the legs real bad all the time.  A thigh, a thigh Charlie Horse right on the side of the thigh is so fucking painful.  John, we had John, uh, uh, uh, punch my left arm, and when you, he, he, he punched 
[02:06:30]  harder.  It's hard to say because both were about the same, um, I think Rashad's hurt a little bit  more.  But, but John hit hard, but I think it was because of where he hit me, too, but Rashad's, uh,  definitely hurt a lot.  Um, that, especially the one on the right arm, and I was more, even more ready for that.  Like, John hit me with a, a, a leg, a shin to the leg, which I could never do again.  That's agonizing.  Like, I, I almost fucking, yeah, no, it was like a, it was a shin to, to my upper thigh. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, I like it.  And I almost fucking, I, I had to go to the bathroom.  I was going to faint.  I was like, my body's not used to that trauma.  I'm like, I might throw up right here in the studio.  You know, what's the first thing that, uh, goes through your mind when he punches you?  Um, you, like, you wait for, there's a split second where you're waiting, you know, it's  about to hurt a lot.  Like, you've been hit, it's like, ah, and you know, it's more is coming, and then more  pain comes.  Like, I'm still feeling even more in my right arm than I did in my left arm, and I know  it's going to be very sore.  Both of my arms, because I like to bird flap a lot. 
[02:07:30]  You know, it's just, it's just how I meet girls.  So I know it's going to be very hard.  And you lost all his weight, so now you got less, less, less, less, less protecting me.  Jimmy's crazy.  He's crazy, man.  So when he's lining up, and it's almost like he's, like, aiming for where he's going to  put that shot, that anticipation would kill me.  I don't know if I could, ah.  He could, man.  No.  It hurts, but I mean, it's like, you know, he's not going to try to, because the material  of the sweater slides off.  Yeah, you know, it's a real gentleman's cashmere.  Sweater boy, Jimmy.  Can I see your arms? 
[02:08:00]  Are they bruised already?  They won't be bruised up.  Or red?  It'll take a day, probably two.  The right one will bruise work.  Oh, that'll be bruised up really nicely.  Yeah, both of them will be.  So I could just, I'll have Twitter photos of it, like I did last time.  Just black in his eye.  Rashad.  Just pop him in the head.  If it didn't do what it could do, or shatter your jaw, I would love to.  But I couldn't do it.  These guys just hit too hard.  Will it take a punch?  Yeah, because even though there's a way to hit, but I could never take a punch to the face  or head from these guys.  But I would love to, which I could do it once.  I think if he did it 20%, you'd be all right. 
[02:08:30]  No.  How about a punch in the chest?  No, because my heart's too...  That's too close to that heart shit.  Yeah.  Do you have a bad heart?  No, but I would if you hit me.  As of yet, it's been fine.  But no, I don't have big chest muscle.  This is all an illusion.  I don't do it.  All I do is elliptical lacrosse training.  Man, we used to play a game.  All I do is that is elliptical.  We used to play a game as kids, and it was called open chest.  And you have to walk around with your chest like this.  And if you put your arms down or see your chest open, you get punched by the chest. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, so you had to walk around covering your chest with your arms.  And the second somebody put their guard down, you would just lean into them and punch them.  You would just lean and punch them.  And the worst game that we played is a game called Butchie Baker.  And if you said any word that started with a B, you had to say Butchie Baker after you said it, or you'd get punched.  Holy shit.  It's all just punching with these guys.  Holy shit.  I just wouldn't talk.  And the worst part about it was I was like the youngest guy in my crew, so I would have to play these games. 
[02:09:30]  I'm hanging out with guys that's like seven years older than me, Uncle Billy, right?  Uncle Billy would make you play these games, and he's like, we're playing Butchie Baker.  And I'm like, I don't want to play.  Yeah, you do.  So no matter what, you say B, and they're like, man, you know, before, and then you don't even, you know, just talking, you don't realize that the next thing you know, you've got like four guys.  Bam!  What did I do?  You cry.  What the hell?  You can't even say Butchie Baker because you cried and beat up so much. 
[02:10:00]  That's insanity.  I'm tempted.  I can't take one of the shots.  I can't do it.  You would fall down.  I know.  I know I would.  Jimmy, you did good today.  Relax.  Jimmy wants more.  It's like, Jimmy wants more.  Relax.  It's like fine china, his bones.  It's like calf meat, baby.  Yeah, baby, calf meat.  E-Rox would take a punch?  What if he drops dead of a heart attack?  Yeah, that's your reason I wouldn't.  Jimmy, you got a special two-age.  I don't want to kill you.  I don't want to kill you.  No, but E-Rox doesn't have a hint of a muscle on his body, so. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God, nothing there.  Don't fuck with him.  He's laughing.  Yeah.  I think Rashad did it.  Yeah, I think this was great.  I'll tell you why, because I would almost feel bad if I got really hurt just for, you  don't want that.  No, no, no.  Not in the chest.  The face would be hilarious, though.  It would be.  And if I could do it without a shattered jaw, which is my living, I would do it.  Jimmy's taking many shots to the face, but.  Different shots.  Hold on now.  Hold on a second.  But I just, yeah, I can't do it. 
[02:11:00]  Whatever happened to Uncle Billy?  Uncle Billy?  Uncle Billy?  You ever get him back?  Well, I did, but by the time I was able to get him back, you know, we boxed one time,  and Uncle Billy's like, yeah, let's box.  Come on.  Let's do it.  And I'm like 16 at the time, and Uncle Billy's like 25 or something.  So we're boxing, and I get Uncle Billy, and I catch him with a good shot, and then he  stops, and he's like, this is stupid.  I'm not going to do it anymore.  And I was like, what happened?  You know what, I just, I slipped on a grass, and like you hit me as I was going down.  You know, I did it to myself. 
[02:11:30]  What a bully jerk he sounds like.  Who's your uncle, the great Santini?  He sounds like a real jerk.  Uncle Billy was like really big when we were kids, but now Uncle Billy's really small.  So any time you see, I see Uncle Billy now, I like start messing with him.  He's like, come on, that's old stuff.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Leave it in the past, bro, leave it in the past.  That must really be like, that must be fun for you, though, right?  It is, because Billy, Uncle Billy was like.  Leave it in the past.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Uncle Billy, the thing about Uncle Billy is like, he had like this one black friend,  right?  This one black friend, and he was like, he was like the man.  And Uncle Billy, like he would always like joke around and say like almost racist comments  to me, but then he wouldn't like fully say it, right?  He would like almost say racist comments, but then when his one black friend came around,  he acted like I was his best friend.  Nah, nah, this is my little brother right here.  Nah, nah, what's up, little homie?  Come on.  It's Uncle Billy white, I'm a little confused.  Yeah, Uncle Billy was white.  Because he sounded like a white guy. 
[02:12:30]  Uncle Billy's not my uncle.  He's like one of my best friend's uncle, but he called him Uncle Billy, yeah.  I understand.  What would he almost say?  How did you know it was going to be a racial thing?  Well, he wasn't allowed to say the N-word, right?  Because his mom, his mom, like Billy, you know, he got caught saying it a couple of times,  right?  So what he did, what Uncle Billy did was, Uncle Billy made up a word, and he would say to me  that meant, that meant like the same thing.  So he'd be like, what's up, Carbo? 
[02:13:00]  Carbo?  Carbo.  Yeah, Carbo.  Not quite the same impact.  Well, I think, no, no, you know, Carbo, like carbonate or something like that.  Right, right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, so like he would always say those terms to me and like try to joke around and like,  you know, say something.  I mean, he was a dick.  Right, he sounds like it.  Like when kids talk about like they get bullied now, I'm like, dude, you have no idea what I  went through.  Like Uncle Billy was a terrorist, man.  Like one time, like if I came to get my friend after school, because they shared a room together, 
[02:13:30]  Uncle Billy would catch me in the room, and he'd be like, you know what it is, guys?  After school beatings.  He'd lock the door.  He'd lock the door.  He'd beat the hell out of like a half an hour.  What a character.  Was he a jerk or was he playful?  He was playful, but he was a jerk, too.  Like there was no escaping Uncle Billy.  Like you never knew what was going to happen when you went to my friend's house.  We had a, we'd do BB gun wars, and we're only allowed to do one pump with a BB gun shot. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So he starts in the one pump.  Yeah, Uncle Billy would put like five pumps in it, and then he'd shoot it, and then it'd  like stick in your skin, right?  Oh, fuck.  And then he'd like, I'm like, oh, Uncle Billy, how many shots was that?  It was only one.  Stop being a baby or I'm going to pound you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I will.  Yeah.  Better stop crying.  And you can't quit either.  All right.  Better go high.  Oh, man.  Her shot's scaring us.  It's great.  This is taking him back to a time.  Don't I like Uncle Billy?  Did he ever, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone has to ask. 
[02:14:30]  Did Uncle Billy ever get creepy when he was rolling around?  Like, yeah, everybody wrestle on me.  No.  Did he ever, I don't know.  Okay.  Did he ever like, let's say, hey, guys, drop your jaws now.  Because your eyes are going to another place, so I'm wondering what this Uncle Billy's all  about.  Uncle Billy was crazy, dude.  Yeah.  I love you.  I can't tell if you like or hate Uncle Billy.  I don't know.  I think he hates Uncle Billy a little bit.  I like Uncle Billy now because he made me tough.  But when I was little, dude, I'm like, dude, oh, man, keep Uncle Billy away from me. 
[02:15:00]  See?  Uncle Billy.  Wow.  That's great.  Rashad, you're awesome, really.  Yeah.  I'm...  We can't wait for the fight Saturday.  You and Jon Jones, obviously.  UFC 145 Saturday on pay-per-view at 10 o'clock.  Damn.  I think we did it.  Yeah.  And next time I'll take one, I'll take a punch in the chest.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  You got to get your chest game up.  You know what I'm going to suggest?  You can do a deck of cards and just do half the deck.  So that means every single time you flip over a card, you do that many push-ups. 
[02:15:30]  So if it's like a face card, you do like 10 push-ups.  If it's like a five, you do five push-ups.  If it's an ace, you do 20 push-ups.  And you do a half a deck like that?  Is that like...  Well, I would do like that deck like twice.  No.  Yeah, twice.  How many push-ups would that be in total?  It's like maybe 1,000.  Holy fuck.  400.  400.  I can't do more than 999.  No way.  It's like 400 and something if you do like one whole deck and then you do it again. 
[02:16:00]  How long do you get to rest between push-ups?  It all depends.  You know, when you get in shape, you can just be able to flip them over.  I usually do it, shake out a little bit, and then do it again.  I don't wait too long.  Do you do a lot of sit-ups?  I hate sit-ups.  Obviously.  Yeah.  You know what I do?  Sometimes back to the elliptical for a second if we can before Rashad goes.  Since a couple of gentlemen are talking about exercise, I like to tighten up a little bit  or I'll bring weights onto the elliptical with me and I'll do like abs that way because 
[02:16:30]  I hate doing abs.  I do it over the big ball, you know.  You get back all the way.  I get dizzy if my head goes back like that.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  You know a good way to do abs and it's kind of if all you use...  Genetics?  Yeah.  Have the right pairs.  A good way to do your abs and just not even really think about it is try to flex your abs  for like minutes at a time.  Just like right now, if you try to flex your abs and walk around.  Like a tight enough?  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Just see how long you can flex them for.  That's better than crunches and stuff?  Well, I mean, you kind of get your mindset and it kind of...  And you kind of do it when you're just kind of sitting around doing nothing.  Yeah, you can just kind of sit around doing nothing.  You can just kind of see how long you can flex your abs for.  That's pretty good.  I have decent abs underneath the fat.  No, you don't.  Underneath the fat, everyone's got decent abs.  No, but I can take a good shot.  Feel the skin and fat off it.  I got a six pack.  Stop.  Let's go to ground zero here.  Jimmy wants to take another shot.  No, no, no.  I won't take a punch in the air.  But you can give it a little poke.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Actually, it's kind of hard, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't fart. 
[02:17:30]  No, I won't.  It's hard.  It's gas.  It would be funny if you gave me a little jab and my teeth fell out and I shit.  All right, Rashad.  Well, man, I'm not going to say good luck Saturday.  I'm just, you know.  Yeah, I hope you do really well.  Absolutely.  You know, I think I'm pulling for Rashad.  I like both of these guys, but you got to pick one guy.  And I want to see Rashad win.  Yeah.  Kick ass, man.  All right, I'll say it to Rashad.  Oh, wait a minute here. 
[02:18:00]  Don't let me twist your arm or nothing.  No, but he has a sports curse.  Yeah, he does.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You don't want that endorsement.  No, you don't want that endorsement.  No, I've been good lately.  You actually have been on a winning streak.  I've been good lately.  I'm on a winning streak, so let's see.  All right, Rashad.  Come back and see us, all right?  All right.  Take it easy.  This is the Open Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Oh, that was a lot of fun, man.  I learned Uncle Billy's an asshole. 
[02:18:30]  I learned Uncle Billy's an asshole.  Yeah, that's what he sounded like.  Because everyone gets their headphones back on.  You're in ease.  Love the fucking Uncle Billy stories from Rashad Evans.  But his eyes got kind of crazy.  Yeah.  It brought him back to a time and a place.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He would do the impression of him, and it's like, oh, boy.  His eyes are like, oh, okay.  Uncle Billy, man.  Yeah.  He definitely didn't like the guy too much, especially back then.  It's hard to pick with these guys, but I really like Rashad. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Like, as a guy.  I like Jon Jones, too.  He's a nice guy.  Rashad's fun.  Like, he's, you know, he's just a regular guy that could beat the shit out of you.  Very different personalities.  Oh, yeah.  More.  But Rashad's a bit more down to earth, and what I like about Jon Jones is he's got that  kind of Muhammad Ali cockiness to him, which I used to love.  Muhammad Ali's cock?  Cock.  Oh.  That's different.  I wonder what he was getting at that he wouldn't say.  I wonder what he was getting at that he wouldn't say.  Oh. 
[02:19:30]  I got some ideas about that.  Oh.  Wow.  Let's just watch the fight.  Why don't we do that?  All right.  Where were we?  Bill Cosby.  We got the, uh...  Do we got the, uh...  Well, the Cos was talking about Trayvon Case.  What, are you having some...  I was about to say put, but I couldn't say it.  Cosby says guns not race. 
[02:20:00]  The key issue in Trayvon Martin case.  Dr. Huxtable is going to speak.  Yeah.  What does he say?  You hear about what Bill Maher said?  What did, what did dumb ass fuck Bill Maher say?  Well, Bill Maher used the shooting as fodder for his real-time monologue on Friday.  He said...  Remember, if a black...  Oh, okay.  He says, uh...  Oh, hold on.  Maybe I should start from the beginning.  Just sounded like you were going to say something racist. 
[02:20:30]  I know.  Bill Maher said this on Real Time.  You can tell it's a crazy crowd tonight because it's raining out there, and also it's Friday the 13th.  Remember, if a black cat crosses your path, it is bad luck, except in Florida, where you're allowed to shoot it.  Oh, God.  That's a good...  That's a fucking ballsy joke to do.  That's a joke.  I'll give him that it's a joke.  That's a ballsy joke.  Bill Maher.  You don't like his politics?  No.  No. 
[02:21:00]  I'm not a big Bill Maher fan.  I'm not, because I just think he's an asshole as a person.  I guess we're waiting for the...  I guess the 20th of April is when we'll see if Zimmerman gets bail.  They're having a bail hearing for him.  Really?  And see if he can post bail.  I don't know.  He doesn't seem like a flight risk.  I mean, he turned himself in.  Right.  He's waiting for trial.  He's not going to...  It doesn't seem like he's going to bolt anywhere.  Maybe it's best he stays in jail.  Why?  Keeps everyone calm.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:21:30]  Well, that's what it'll be.  That's why they ask him.  Why he out?  Why he out, motherfucker?  I wonder what's going to happen to him.  I don't know enough about...  Obviously, we keep saying that, but it's like, who the fuck knows?  I've been studying, Jimmy.  I've been studying some legal issues.  Whoa!  And it does seem, second-degree murder, I'm not sure about this.  But the whole burden of proof thing, it's very odd in a self-defense case, especially down in Florida.  Um, it's not the prosecution's burden to prove. 
[02:22:00]  It shifts to the defense to have more evidence that it was self-defense than the prosecution has that says it wasn't.  So, uh, because in essence what you're doing is you're going in there, they're not arguing the murder case.  They're saying, yeah, I did it.  He's saying it happened.  So the prosecution doesn't have to prove that he killed somebody, because it's stated.  It's a fact.  But what's being argued is justification for the shooting, and that is based on a perpetuance of evidence. 
[02:22:30]  That's fair, though.  It's like proving insanity or anything like that.  Right, right, right.  Like, for an insanity defense, you have to...  They can't just...  Preponderance of evidence.  Yeah.  Preponderance of evidence.  Yeah, so it's, uh, it's a lot different than people think when, when...  Because I've read a bunch of shit, and I'm like, okay, I'm confused on this.  So I become a, uh, a wiki lawyer, and, uh, you know, go on various sites and, and look up the legal rapifications.  And, uh, habeas corpus. 
[02:23:00]  And, uh, yeah, that seems to be it.  It's more a, uh, more an issue of justification than it is the killing itself.  I don't think he's gonna, I honestly don't think he's gonna get a murder to rap.  I can't see it fucking happening.  Um, I don't think there's enough evidence to, for the prosecution to show that it wasn't self-defense,  more so than the, the evidence that's there, the witnesses, um, his statement, uh, Zimmerman's statement,  to prove that he was indeed feeling threatened and used deadly force accordingly. 
[02:23:30]  Um, whether it happened or not, I don't know.  I don't think anybody really does except for him.  But whether it can be proved or not, that's another thing.  And I think it will weigh in his favor a little more.  And I, I, with an honest jury that isn't biased by the news and everything else, uh, and the threat of riots,  I, I think he would skate this one.  Or do you think, um, they plead it to, uh,  Well, that's another thing.  You can take a plea deal. 
[02:24:00]  They put the charges, the highest they could have given him was second.  And they put it up there and then say, all right, look, plead it down to manslaughter.  You get four years.  You're out in two.  Uh, but I don't think he'd go for that.  I honestly think he can skate this, this murder too.  Murder too can be life, which of course you would never do.  So, but manslaughter, I bet you'd get more than four years.  I bet you they'd offer a manslaughter.  Six.  Ten years.  Really?  Out in five, out in four.  That seems like a lot.  Man, that does seem like a lot.  Especially for a plea deal where he thinks, yeah, he's going to fuck it. 
[02:24:30]  He might skate.  At that point, he might as well take a chance.  Right.  They got to really sweeten it because, um.  They're going to make it all nice.  Just so he gets some kind of jail.  Yeah, yeah.  Two to two years.  I don't know.  I, I, I can't see second.  Just two years to murder someone.  That's.  Yeah.  So weird.  Sure makes you think about your past lives, uh, or your past, uh, the past in your life.  What?  And think about like, I'd have been out.  Oh, yeah.  I would have been out by now.  I'd have been out.  True.  I would, I'd have a neck tattoo or a couple of those or, but I'd be out. 
[02:25:00]  I like, uh, everybody, everybody comments on things too.  Ant, the stand your ground defense will have this whole thing knocked down.  Yeah, that is true.  Whether you, whether you agree with the stand your ground, think it should be repealed,  love it, whatever.  The, the, the truth of the matter is it's the law of the land down there.  So whatever happens during the time it is the law has to be adhered to.  You can't say, well, that's a dumb thing.  And then have a trial based on the fact that you don't think it's a good law.  It is the law. 
[02:25:30]  It has to be adhered to.  What is stand your ground exactly?  Is it just being, you don't have to back off?  You don't, when confronted with, uh, violence, you, you can, um, protect yourself.  You can respond with violence.  You don't have to.  Is that how it should be?  Well, it should be.  It isn't.  And it isn't in New York.  Uh, you, you really have to have exhausted every route of retreat that is possible.  You, uh, you, you, they really want you to just run and get away from the situation.  And, uh, even during an altercation, a violent altercation, the dynamic of a, a use of deadly 
[02:26:00]  physical force changes every second.  It changes.  If the aggressor, um, all of a sudden backs off, you then cannot use deadly physical force  no matter how badly that person pummeled you.  If it's determined that they were then retreating from the assault and you then use deadly physical  force, you can be held liable for his, uh, murder.  Even if you think he's on his way back to do it again. 
[02:26:30]  That would have to be explained.  That would have to be in court.  You'd have to find witnesses.  You'd have to convince somebody that he was indeed coming back at you, uh, to, to do you  harm.  You're better off to be murdered.  Sometimes you're better off to be murdered.  Club Soda Kenny probably has some, uh,  It seems exhausting.  Am I allowed to shoot?  I can't shoot.  Can I shoot?  No, I don't think I can.  That's crazy.  One more thing.  I don't know if you mentioned, you can't be the aggressor and then claim self-defense.  And then claim self-defense.  That's what they're going to try to get Zimmerman on. 
[02:27:00]  The fact that he was following Trayvon, but following is not necessarily being the aggressor.  Um, him being the neighborhood watch guy following, called 911.  And then if he was going back to his truck and was, as he said, attacked by Trayvon, it's  an absolute self-defense.  Uh, if he was, um, antagonizing Trayvon, if, if, if somehow witnesses come forward that  can say that Trayvon felt threatened by this guy, then he might have some problems. 
[02:27:30]  But, um, yeah, it's, uh, it's tough.  This is going to be a big one.  It's, there's so many gray areas in this case that it, uh, it's going to be very hard.  The ideal, uh, situation for the people involved would be to give them the manslaughter, give  them the, give them the four years out in two.  That keeps a lot of people calm.  Four in two, five out in three, you know, whatever it is.  But that keeps everybody calm.  I'm not saying that's the right thing.  Right.  But as far as society goes, that would be the easy thing.  I don't think so.  Who knows what happened to him in jail, too?  It's like, nah, he's got to be protective. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  He'll protect him the whole time.  Zimmerman's quoted as saying he's willing to forget about it if everybody else will.  Oh.  Well, that's nice of him.  Fucking Kenny.  I think he rules.  Fucking Kenny.  Uh, yeah.  What do you think, Kenny?  I mean, you were a cop.  I mean, like, it all, you know, liberal, it all depends.  I don't know, like, you know, they're big on guns down there in Florida, but you get  the wrong judge, the wrong jury, the wrong...  What do you think of his...  You give me one coffee drink on that jury.  Jack Child.  What do you think of his excuse? 
[02:28:30]  Well, the guy's life is...  One guy's dead, the other guy's life is ruined.  Yeah.  Ruined!  But is his life...  I mean, is his excuse...  Do you think what he's saying is what happened, or do you think he got carried away and did  not have to pull the trigger?  I, I...  I...  It's not fair to comment.  I don't know all the details.  I don't, you know, I just...  I don't pay attention.  I think regardless of what actually happened, it's, that, that's irrelevant.  What matters is the evidence they have, the witnesses that they have, and that testimony. 
[02:29:00]  It's what you can prove.  Now, Zimmerman knows, he knows in his own head, wow, fuck, I went off, you know, I shouldn't  have done that, but if he can prove that Trayvon was an aggressor, then he's off.  It's, it's absolutely what you can prove at this point.  The actual real circumstance is almost inconsequential.  He can't, you know, he can't, he can't afford a high-powered legal team.  No.  Now he's getting donations, though.  He's getting donations.  Yeah, it's a good website.  Who knows what the prosecution will even... 
[02:29:30]  Mania.  Are they sending him money?  I don't know.  I've seen some, uh, links, though, where you can contribute.  Jesus.  They were, they were on that site.  Uh, this guy wants to correct Kenny while Kenny's in studio.  Tom.  Oh.  New Orleans.  Tom.  Hey, how you doing?  Hello.  All right.  Now, the guy claimed self-defense.  If, if Martin was defending himself against Zimmerman, once Zimmerman is no longer a threat,  if Martin continues, he's no longer defending himself. 
[02:30:00]  He's now the aggressor.  Well, that's what I was saying.  It changes by the second.  Now, now, like Kenny said, if you instigate the aggression, um, I think Trayvon would have  been able to respond in kind, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  And, and, and then if Zimmerman backed off and then Trayvon continued the aggression  and escalated it, then Zimmerman would be able to respond in kind.  What are your credentials, sir? 
[02:30:30]  You have a phone?  I have a phone and I have a commission.  Oh.  What does that mean?  What's your last name?  Gordon?  Yeah.  What are you commission?  What are you, what are you, what are you make commission sales or something?  What are you to commission something?  Hey, where's Warren?  That's not funny.  What's Warren got to do with it?  Fucking asshole.  Jesus.  Fucking stupid.  Angry chip.  Who's Warren?  Fucking cocksucker motherfucker. 
[02:31:00]  Holy.  He's so angry.  All right, Tom.  Angry chip.  Let's go to, uh, Bob in Kentucky.  Bob.  Let's go to Bob.  What are we, a bunch of apples or something?  Ah, your turn.  Your turn.  So.  This is great.  Bobby.  What's going on, guys?  I tell you, I kind of had a similar situation.  Kentucky's got the same rules for this.  You know, and we actually had to say you could open carry without a concealed weapons permit.  My wife was out in the yard and a gentleman walked up and started, you know, screaming at her for no apparent reason. 
[02:31:30]  I was out in the middle of nowhere.  No reason for him to be there.  Started running at her.  She shot him.  Ooh.  Police killed him.  Police came by and, uh, that's what happened.  Never went to trial.  Never went to say anything.  We were getting threatened by the neighborhood at this point now.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Wow.  I don't like open carry.  I don't know.  It's kind of...  I mean, it's very old west.  It's kind of cool and everything, but I just don't like the fact that people know that you're  armed like that. 
[02:32:00]  I kind of like concealed carry better.  That's the point of open carry.  Are you going to fuck with the guy who's got a .357 strap to his head?  Well, the thing is, you really...  It would be very hard to keep tabs on it at all times.  I mean, I don't like the idea that someone could run up behind you and snatch it out of  your fucking holster.  You know, you can't keep an eye on it 24 hours a day when you're wearing it, you know?  Well, I understand that, but I mean, you've got to take some balls to run up to somebody  that's, you know, walking around.  I mean, you could actually come from New York.  I hear you.  Across the Kentucky line, you can actually have a loaded handgun on your dash as long 
[02:32:30]  as it's not concealed.  Ooh.  You can carry it on your person if you're not, you know...  I have it on my person, you know?  You ever come across an NYPD guy and you see his gun while you're walking on the street  and you go, man, I might go for that.  No!  Me either.  I was just bringing it up.  That's funny.  You're looking up.  I bet I could grab that.  You get a weird feeling, though.  It's like a game.  It's like, I bet I could get that out of there before he knows that.  Sometimes you get a weird feeling, no?  Jesus. 
[02:33:00]  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  And above it.  You want to play the Cosby clip?  Because I want to get the old people that are promoting condoms and...  What?  There's a few other really good little stories in the news today we want to get to.  But first...  What, do they want male nurses to wear them?  Because they're getting fucked by them.  What age do you think you've got to get to where it doesn't matter anymore, the sex thing?  Why would you...  18?  I was actually going to say 20, but...  But why would you wear a condom if you're in your 70s?  Exactly. 
[02:33:30]  Diseases.  Who gives a fuck at that point?  You don't want an itchy dick if you're all old.  So annoying.  You've got to hold your dick with one hand.  Who wants to scratch their shaft with the other hand?  All right, yeah.  All right, good point.  Who wants to scratch their shaft?  Good fucking point.  Old person fingernail?  Good point.  You throw a long shit.  Those translucent, veiny hands.  Yeah.  Scratching your fucking...  Your Vaz Deverens is fucking...  Feels like there's fucking ant antlers.  Fucking ant...  Tickling ant.  Ant antlers?  Yeah.  I'd love to see that. 
[02:34:00]  Little ant antlers.  Yeah.  My Aunt Moose or something.  You know what?  The Cosby clip could wait.  Go to safersex4seniors.org.  You don't spell out four.  That's hot.  It's the number four.  Safesex4seniors.org.  Because what they're doing here is it's a new ad featuring senior citizens simulating sex positions  to promote use of condoms.  Look at this shit.  Oh, no.  What the fuck is this? 
[02:34:30]  They got old people in various sexual positions.  Doing all of the known positions.  Yeah.  This is so cool.  Party, party.  Oh, God.  Pause.  Oh, God.  This is great.  Pause.  This is great.  Can you put this on our Facebook page, E-Rock?  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Like us, motherfuckers.  Sorry.  In Florida alone, STDs and seniors has risen 71%.  Who gives a fuck at that point?  It could raise 100%.  If four had it and now fucking eight have it, it still doesn't make it that big a deal. 
[02:35:00]  Well, this is how they're selling the safe sex thing by showing all these old people.  They're clothed in all these weird sexual positions.  Not weird.  All the sexual positions we all know and love.  Hit play again there, sir.  Let's get your body moving.  Party, party.  Let's get it on.  Party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party,  These are fucking phenomenal.  They're all just crawling on each other. 
[02:35:30]  They're doing like Kama Sutra moves.  I like the one where the old bro is kneeling right in front of the old guy, giving him a head.  And they're all fully clothed in their old people clothes.  Polyester pants and shit.  It's my polyester pants suit.  I'm wearing a pants suit.  In one scene, a particularly strong man is holding a woman who is standing upside down on her elbows.  Deadpan expressions are shown on their faces.  Yeah.  What do I know?  He was eating my cunt.  I got tired.  I just kept thinking of the grandchildren. 
[02:36:00]  I said, why do you have to give me a white one for Pete's sake?  How about a dorky?  I'd love to feel one of those rubbing all on my cunt.  I'm being fucked.  Ask me about my grandchildren.  Yeah.  I tied his cock up with my charm bracelet.  You should have seen his balls.  The veins were all jumpy.  Oh, what do I know?  My grandson's an honor student, eat my box.  I couldn't get wet, so he had to put grape jelly in there and put his fist in. 
[02:36:30]  I said, go ahead, put your fist in my cunt.  Oh, this is great.  It's sponsored by AARP.  Oh, I said, my God, your cunt tastes so sugary, he said, I have diabetes.  Oh, I can't afford this.  I'm trying to save money for my final expenses.  To not be a burden on my family.  Final expenses.  Final expenses.  Oh, that's great.  It's called the good riddance grandma. 
[02:37:00]  One way ticket to Dirtville.  A fun stopper.  Yeah, exactly.  Who gives a fuck about final expenses?  It'll hurt with final expenses.  Well, let the fucking people you leave behind worry about that shit.  Deal with it.  I'm not going to set that shit up for you.  Well, you know, we don't want to be a burden on the children.  That's right.  That's why we have this insurance policy that Alex Trebek talks about.  They'll ask you no medical questions.  Really?  Right. 
[02:37:30]  I bet.  All right.  We're going to go to break with a brand new how much bit from Danny.  We never heard from the cause.  I know.  We'll do Cosby after the break.  There was something else that's kind of cool.  Oh, is there a new one?  Yeah, yeah.  A new one from Danny.  And I want to know about the Secret Service prostitution thing in Colombia.  Oh, boy.  Colombia.  What a mess for nothing.  For nothing.  Fucking what a...  By the way, I'm still reading that Clint Hill book.  Yeah.  Because it's hard to get...  You see how it is in this day and age we talk about how hard it is.  It's so good, dude. 
[02:38:00]  It's so fucking interesting.  His traveling with Jackie Kennedy.  Really.  I wish I had read...  I wish we had had the book more time than I had read it before.  Because the assassination is amazing.  But there's so much other stuff I wish I would have asked him.  She had grace.  Did he get it in with her?  I don't think he did.  I don't know if he did or not.  But I...  Just to be...  There was...  Because she wound up marrying Aristotle Onassis.  And he said before they went to Greece for the first time, JFK called him into the Oval Office,  Clint Hill.  And Robert Kennedy was in the Oval Office with him.  And JFK and Robert Kennedy said, 
[02:38:30]  Whatever you do in Greece, do not let her cross paths with Aristotle Onassis.  Damn.  He fucked up.  He had charges.  He tried to defraud the United States.  There was a lot of bad shit about him.  And then she married him.  I would love to know more about that.  It's starting to seem like Clint Hill really wasn't good at his job.  No, he couldn't.  And the president died.  And the other thing.  And Aristotle got her.  And Aristotle got her.  Just kidding, Clint Hill.  We liked you.  The Opium Anthony Show. 
[02:39:00]  I go on and on and on and  Go take them to the crib unless they're boning  Easy, call them on the phone and  Clap them Chanel, come on in  I stay dressed  In person  A negro  Excuse me while I whip this out  Pam Burton  Hey, where are the white women at?  What is it about this guy? 
[02:39:30]  I fucking love it.  Do you like this at all, man?  Yeah, I don't mind some of this stuff.  God damn it.  I don't know what it is.  I like kicking it  What they call old school, though.  Old school because  I don't like the new hip-hop.  This is old school.  I know.  This is what I like this.  This is probably pushing 20 years older this morning, right? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, motherfucker.  When did he die?  97.  98, 97-ish.  So that's 15 years ago right there.  So yeah, this song could be close to 20 years old.  Yeah.  Something about it, man.  Who?  Biggie Smalls.  I like Biggie Smalls.  I like Biggie Smalls.  He always makes me think of Patrice.  Yeah?  You know what's funny?  People told me this weekend was Patrice's weekend in D.C.  when I was there.  I didn't know that.  Oh, shit.  So a lot of people were telling me,  like, you know, Patrice's supposed to be here.  I really didn't know that,  but it was a lot of well-wishings  and love for Patrice from D.C. 
[02:40:30]  Still, man.  But did he always make you think of Patrice?  Fucking Patrice.  Yeah.  He loved him.  He loved him.  Oh, yeah.  Because he'd been a fucking other big man, you know?  Yeah.  Toto.  Toto.  Toto.  Few puffs.  Eyes got low.  And off to the bedroom we go.  Sex is drama.  Head is trauma.  Rip pajamas.  I'm gonna stay till tomorrow.  I'm gonna stay till tomorrow.  How do you rhyme?  Pajamas and tomorrow.  Pajama?  Tomorrow? 
[02:41:00]  Makes that rhyming shit easy.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Let's change the word.  Sam, you mind a nigga?  Yeah, motherfuckers.  What a beat this is, right?  It's just like...  I like it.  I don't know what it is.  It's effortless.  It's just so smooth.  Mm-hmm.  Smooth.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  Wow.  What do I do?  I like Biggie Smalls, but I don't have anything.  So what do I...  Did Jim say what a beat this is? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  That's P. Diddy.  He was great with the beat.  Yeah.  This is when Diddy was nobody.  He was somebody.  He used to know who he was.  Ah, shit up.  He's a great producer.  Yeah.  I would never argue that.  Everybody knew it who mattered.  He wasn't no Diddy.  Put it this way.  If Diddy had a giant Hamptons party back when this fucking shit was happening, no one would  go.  It would have been huge.  He was an industry genius.  Thank you, Eric.  Thank you.  No.  It would have been huge maybe in the industry. 
[02:42:00]  You wouldn't get people like Regis Philbin going.  Come on.  And if he was so great, why didn't he move to the front back then?  Yeah.  Well, because he was behind the scenes.  He was behind the scenes.  He had to wait for every breath you take, every move you make.  I want to download this.  Yeah.  What do I do?  I like Biggie Smalls.  Where do I start?  Greatest Hits?  Is there a Greatest Hits?  No.  He only did two albums.  He did, right?  Grab the two albums.  Yeah.  Just get ready to die.  Get the whole collection.  I celebrate his entire collection. 
[02:42:30]  He did one album, and then he did a double disc set, so that's it.  That's it.  And I'm good.  Are they both good?  They're fantastic.  They're amazing.  Yeah.  Like, his first album is...  How do I do that?  One of the best rap albums of all time.  I got my phone.  Now you go on iTunes.  Ready to die.  Oh, that's right.  What?  So you go to iTunes.  I can do stuff with this phone.  And you...  Oh, that's right.  He's on his Android.  Android.  My Samsung.  My Samsung.  For AT&T.  What did Sam sing?  Was it a song?  No.  It's a Samsung phone. 
[02:43:00]  It's a funny one, though, Chip.  I know it is, fuckhead.  Oh, shit.  God, you even want to compliment him, and he still gets all nasty with you.  I know.  Chip is turning me around.  The Angry Chip.  Fucking great.  I cut a dick.  Love Angry Chip.  You heard this song?  I don't know any of them.  Oh, I've heard this.  It's like maybe one of the best rap songs ever.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Thank you.  Oh, that's Rappin' Duke.  The Negro.  The Negro. 
[02:43:30]  All right, what do we know about the prostitution thing and the Secret Service there?  It's a fucking very big...  It's one asshole, and it's about over $47 or whatever.  And you know, everyone with him probably wants to fucking shoot him because...  Oh, yeah.  What, the guy wouldn't pay his $47 and then made this come to light?  Eleven or...  This is what I know roughly.  Eleven or twelve agents from Columbia doing advanced work for Obama.  And apparently they all got hookers down there where it is legal.  Yeah.  But... 
[02:44:00]  Probably against, you know...  Sure.  The moral clause in your fucking contract.  And they have something called...  Where the girls have to check in.  No, no, no, no.  I meant to say, they said the next morning, the desk person realized that one of the girls  had not taken her license back and left the hotel.  So there, they have the same thing they have in Brazil.  Yeah.  Which is, no, no, you can go up to the room one at a time, but you have to leave your driver's  license at the fucking front desk.  That's where they know what girl's up in the room, so they can't just rob tourists and 
[02:44:30]  kill tourists.  Oh.  Well, that's very nice.  It's a security measure.  And so they were arguing.  When the desk people went up there, they were arguing.  Mm-hmm.  And it was over money.  And he didn't want to pay her the 40 or whatever.  Whatever he owed, it might have been 200.  I don't know what it was.  A couple hundred bucks.  It wasn't that much.  And then he eventually did pay her, but the cops were called.  She called the cops.  She was pissed off because it's legal there.  Mm-hmm.  So she had nothing to hide.  Yeah.  And this dumb motherfucker.  I don't care if she didn't fuck you, if she was asking for too much.  Mm-hmm.  I've had a couple of those in my life where there was a problem, and I knew that I was 
[02:45:00]  right.  But the bigger picture was, we're in my house.  What am I going to have?  A violent altercation in my house and the cops show?  It's like, where is this going to go?  Mm-hmm.  I wasn't in danger.  So I was just like, you know, just pay and get a...  Not that it wasn't...  Do you think?  I wasn't being robbed.  It was just like, oh, the service wasn't good or the girl...  You know, it was like bullshit like that.  Wow.  But this guy fucked up, and then it spiraled out of control, went to the embassy.  Oh, boy.  And all these agents are in trouble. 
[02:45:30]  Because of one dick.  One dick.  11 agents.  And they said that they had arrived a week ago and drank heavily.  And the problem is, Hotelier knows the hooker's ID was still at the desk.  One thing that's really weird is they said it could put you, Obama, in assassination danger.  Like, in a weird way because of blackmail.  Like, a lot of these guys are married, and if you set yourself up in a blackmail situation... 
[02:46:00]  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not that you would get the president assassinated, but it compromises your...  It compromises your loyalty and your...  Yeah.  Everything else gets compromised because they could now hold somebody.  So I understand the U.S.'s position on this.  I really do.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  And it just doesn't look good.  You think the hookers in Colombia are good?  Probably.  Obviously, they don't fucking mind causing a stinkeroo.  Wow.  No kidding.  You know?  All right.  Damn.  Oh, it said none of the agents involved were directly assigned to protect the president. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  None of his personal...  His personal team is probably with him.  Yeah, yeah.  The advanced team.  How's your arms?  You're kind of, like, slouching a bit.  You're kind of, like, going like this.  Man, fucking please.  Your shoulders are dropping.  The right one hurts more.  They're actually sore.  They're tender.  I can't wait to see the bruises tomorrow.  Yeah, I could take a punch, though.  You can, Jimmy.  Yeah, no shit.  No one's going to question that.  That first one looked like it hurt because it looked like you bounced off...  It did.  It looked like it bounced off the bone.  50%. 
[02:47:00]  It said, like, a solid thud.  It was, like, one of those, like...  You know what I mean?  It skipped off the fucking arm.  And Jon Jones is hurt more.  But it's funny.  They're both honest about it.  Like, Rashad didn't say 10%.  He said about 50%.  Yeah, yeah.  And Jon Jones said about 70%.  So Jon put a little bit more into it.  And that felt about right.  It wasn't, like, an astronomical amount more.  It was a little bit more Jon's hurt.  And I felt like that was something they were both being honest about.  Because they were both sitting when they threw the punch.  And both punches hurt. 
[02:47:30]  Jon's a little more.  He put more strength into it.  Why do you like pain so much?  It's not that I like pain.  There is something that I noticed there where it was, like...  It wasn't good enough for you.  You wanted more.  Yeah, you wanted more.  You were debating the chest shot.  And you were debating it in the jaw.  Let's be honest.  I wouldn't do the jaw.  But you were debating it for a split second.  No, I was trying to figure out if I could get away with this.  I was bummed that I couldn't do that.  That's what I mean.  Because, uh...  I don't know.  There's something...  It's Jimmy and people that you kind of look up to in some way. 
[02:48:00]  Or you like some type of pain to be given to you.  Well, sometimes.  But with fighters, it's a legitimate thing.  Right.  Yeah, at least you have plausible deniability for saying,  well, he's a fighter and I...  You know, unlike your fantasy with Kiss,  where they threw you down the stairs as a child...  Would hug me and love me.  ...and then would hug you and love you afterwards.  But initially, they were hurting little Jimmy.  No, I don't know if there's any love correlation there. 
[02:48:30]  I think with fighters, though...  Like, I know what you're saying,  but I really do think with them,  it more is just something that most people don't get to experience.  Yeah, that you can experience.  And when I was talking on the way back from the bathroom,  while he was wiping his chin,  and I was talking...  Right.  That's delicious.  Fucking cocksucker.  And...  Fucking got right down on it, didn't you?  Down to the root, like mother used to say.  Oh, shit.  I'll fucking zoot it.  And, uh...  She would say, 
[02:49:00]  I sucked dick down to the root.  And I heard it through the door.  I'm like, what's that, Ma?  She goes, shut up, Chipper.  Stop your jibber jabber.  Fucking whore.  Whoa.  What's that?  I didn't say that.  Chipper's getting more angry these days than he used to, though.  Like, I'm worried.  He's talking so much, and he feels candid,  that these things that he thought...  Yeah, that must be...  Candid?  How come can't didn't?  There's a lot buried inside it.  Of course there's a lot.  We're also going to put your car...  Cover up the pain with laughter.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  But there's something about, like, just taking a shot like that.  Like, I don't mind it.  Like, again, in the face, it'd be different.  Oh, man.  How cool would it be that I have a black eye or something?  I wouldn't mind that.  Or you fucking have a fucking fat lip that's bleeding.  He'd be like, yeah, I got in a fucking little...  I could handle...  Rashad Evans.  Yeah, I got in a little fight.  There's too many things that can go wrong that are for real.  Like, your jaw getting shattered is fucking devastating.  Oh, my God.  Imagine Jimmy on stage.  Yeah.  Very welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Glad to continue here. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I fuck with Casino.  I only tell you a second.  No, I'll be in Cleveland.  I know we're taping this.  I hope they don't notice it.  Oh, shit.  Joe, wired shut.  It's nothing personal, Sonny.  It's business.  I would just keep doing Godfrey the lines.  Oh, shit.  What if he was a bad cop?  We got people like that in the payroll, don't we, Tom?  Can they tell Kenny?  You sound good, Jim.  He would never tell you.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I kind of like getting those fucking shots.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  You sure do.  That's something. 
[02:50:30]  You think so?  I would never do that.  I just wouldn't do it.  I debate it every time.  Oh, it doesn't even come close to the bear.  It's not as bad as you think.  Like, it does hurt.  Part of me wants to just take one, but then I'm like, no.  The worst that can happen is you get a, it hurts.  Who cares?  It's like, I don't want to hurt.  I don't want to hurt.  I don't mind if it's like a controlled pain like that.  Like, it's not like a fucking, uh...  Yeah, but still, I mean, when he was winding up like that, when he was winding up, he's  actually, like, giving little jabs to the air where he's kind of aiming, and I couldn't... 
[02:51:00]  That alone, I'd be like, no, don't.  I'm all faggot.  I wouldn't mind taking a 75 or 80% punch, but I'm only afraid it would break something.  Like, the damage it could do is just not worth it.  And the challenge for Rashad Evans would be finding your chin.  Ah, got it?  Got it?  Is that hurtful?  I'm sorry.  No, it's true, but it'd be funny if he punched my chin and just knocked my whiskers off. 
[02:51:30]  I forget that we're just used to Jimmy by now, so it's fun to see Jim Norton through  other people's eyes, because Mikey B in D.C. goes, why the hell would Jimmy invite a hooker  to his house?  Has he ever heard of a hotel?  No, your house is...  First of all...  Home field advantage.  Home field advantage.  I also...  There's security in my building and door guys, so there's...  There's layers of comfortability or whatever.  I say protection, but you know that they know where they are, and I think you're more 
[02:52:00]  likely to have a problem in a hotel where it's an anonymous setting than in your own house.  Because, again, I know who's at the front in my building, so I feel comfortable.  Do your doorman just understand?  I don't think they care.  I mean...  When they see it, they're like, hey, man.  Yeah.  That's what I don't like about living in a building.  They just know all your shit.  They know people are comings and going.  I fucking hate it, man.  But I don't mind that, because the security that comes with it, I'm okay with. 
[02:52:30]  True.  Like, you know what I mean?  You're right, though.  You do lose a certain amount of...  It's ridiculous.  Believe me.  How many times I've wondered, I wonder if they could tell.  And they comment about everything.  I don't have a good example right now, but everything.  Like, you can come and go.  It's your house.  I mean, we both live in apartments in New York City.  I don't feel like it's my house.  But you ask them, hey, how about those Knicks?  Oh, yeah.  They go, what, a doorman just knows about sports?  Why you can't talk to the doorman about investments?  Seinfeld.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  But you nailed it.  They always ask about sports.  Yeah, yeah.  It's always sports.  That's the number one thing.  Yeah.  But I just feel like I've been in my place going on four years, and I still feel like  I'm just living in a hotel.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And it's sort of the same type of thing.  They open the door for you.  They bring packages up to your room.  It's like, I don't feel like I own my place at all.  That's true.  Roland plays catch with his doorman.  What do you mean?  What the fuck is that?  We talked about it on the after show.  Oh, of course.  He goes down and throws the ball around with him. 
[02:53:30]  He goes, hey, you want to play catch?  Does he bring two mitts?  What is Roland eight?  That's what I'm saying.  It's like an eight-year-old.  You want to play catch?  The doorman gives him life lessons and tells him how he should treat women.  Can the doorman come out and play?  I got a new guy that I have to break in because the doorman, like Kenny picks me up every morning.  The reason is because he's coming to the city anyway, and it's a nice little luxury to have.  And I sit in the front seat, and this new doorman assumes I'm sitting in the back seat, 
[02:54:00]  so I had to fucking explain him.  No, I sit in the front, and he wants to open my door every day.  I hate that shit.  You know the deal?  Yes.  And this morning, he's chasing.  We're now having a race to the front door.  I'm like, will you just leave me the fuck alone?  Tell him that.  Oh, my God.  Could they open the door?  I know they're trying to be nice, but now this morning, I'm walking fast.  He starts walking fast behind me, and he literally pushed me out of the way to open the door for me.  I'm like, I don't need that service.  I'm good.  Maybe other assholes in this building need that.  I don't want that.  I don't like it either.  So you know what I'm talking about? 
[02:54:30]  Yes, dude.  It drives me crazy.  When they always try to grab my luggage, I don't let them touch my luggage.  I don't know why I'm comfortable doing my own fucking luggage.  Like, I'm always like, no, I got it, I got it.  Because I know if my computer's in there, I don't want them fucking dropping it.  So if they touch it, I always stop.  Like, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.  I tell them no.  Oh, boy.  It drives me nuts when they do that shit.  You made your money last year, huh, sir?  My door guy?  I fucking hate that shit.  I always got to tell them I got it, I got it.  Sorry, I went somewhere else with that.  Oh, sorry. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Great time for me to buy Apple call options the other day.  Oops.  I thought of you actually.  Holy mother of fuck, it never fucking fails.  How much does that cost you?  It never fails.  How much does it cost me?  It's costing me every fucking second that ticks by as Apple stock just fucking plummets.  What's it going down to?  I have no idea, because I bought call options.  Because I bought call options.  It's down $14.18 on the day to $5.91.  It hit a high of $644 last week. 
[02:55:30]  And now it's just dying.  Yeah, but that'll go back up.  I talked to my guy about it.  Oh, no, you didn't.  I did, actually.  We just made a bunch of buys.  And he said something about Citadel.  I said, all right.  Oh, my God.  No, we did some buys.  I said, what about Apple?  He goes, I go, what do you think it's going to hit?  And he told me, so he didn't buy it.  Because he thinks it's going to level out around $106.14. 
[02:56:00]  It's just ridiculous.  It's been fucking a juggernaut.  And then I buy options.  I do pretty good, like, testing the waters with some options and stuff like that.  And then I buy some options.  And now I'm going to have to rebuild my whole E-Trade fucking little stock collection again.  Let me pull your coattails.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  What exactly is it to buy options?  I'm not a stock guy.  You're just buying the option to buy the stock.  You don't own the stock. 
[02:56:30]  But you have the option to buy the stock at a certain price.  Let's say I take $1,000 and put it in E-Trade.  Yeah.  And I get the app.  Yeah.  And I call myself, whatever, fucking E-Trade McGillicuddy.  That's my fucking E-Trade game.  And now, how do I take that and parlay it into millions?  Well, let me tell you, because I know how not to do it.  Down fucking $17.21 now. 
[02:57:00]  What?  Yeah.  It's just, it's tanking.  What do you buy?  Do you buy calls?  I want a put.  Give me a put.  I'll give you two calls.  I should have bought put options.  What is that?  Apple is doing very good.  That's me saying, I think this stock is going to go down.  So if you buy, let's say.  I'm going to buy the option.  Let's say the stock is at $100 a share.  All right.  All right.  And I say, that stock is going to fucking be at $50 a fucking share.  I know it's going to go down.  So they say.  So I buy some put options to buy the stock at $50 a share. 
[02:57:30]  So now I have the option to buy it at $50 a share.  Do you have to put the price you want?  Like when you say, I want to buy a put option.  Put means down.  The other, what's it?  What means up?  Call.  Call means up.  Oh, wait.  I'm doing it backwards.  Hold on.  No, no.  I'm confused because I don't have puts right now.  The call options.  You are a put.  I am a put.  I'm a put.  I had bet it was going to go up.  Apple. 
[02:58:00]  So I had call options for $650.  I was betting the stock was going to go to $650.  So at any time, I could have purchased that stock at $650 a share.  So if it goes to $660 a share, doesn't matter to me.  I could still buy it at $650, even though the share price is that.  And then I turn around and sell them immediately for $10 a share profit.  So, wait a minute.  So you put, that's a call option.  Yeah.  Now, how long do you have to fucking have that happen? 
[02:58:30]  Exactly.  How long?  There's a time thing.  What's the time limit?  Well, you could buy for any kind of amount of time.  I bought for May 21st.  So my options expire on May 21st.  Oh, you still have them.  Okay.  Yeah, I still have them.  I got to wait for them to go up.  But as time goes by, the value of your options goes down because when the time gets shorter,  it's less value.  There's less chance that it's going to go up.  Or it's just the length of time that's left in the option also has a value.  I can understand stock and buying and investing. 
[02:59:00]  But let me ask you, day trading and stuff like that and buying puts and calls.  Oh, yeah.  How does that, how is that, and I'm not criticizing, I'm asking you generally.  How is that helping the country?  Not Anthony, but I mean as a thing that people do.  What does that do?  It's almost like it's not real money.  What is it?  Yeah, it isn't.  It's like a big casino, isn't it?  Yeah, I don't know what that means.  And I'm not trying to say it's wrong.  I just don't understand.  It doesn't seem like you're really investing in the company to help it, but there is a 
[02:59:30]  short-term investment that's made, and money is traded, and it's, you know, somebody benefits.  I guess it keeps the economy going.  It just seems like people betting against legalized gambling.  It's weird.  It's crazy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Crazy talk.  But it's even weirder that Apple's tanking like this, and it's right after I buy fucking  options for a stock that's been skyrocketing for months and months and months and months  and months.  Anyway, did you have $650?  It could hurt.  I had, no, I had $640. 
[03:00:00]  So you won.  No, no.  I had $640, so I still have $640.  So if I buy my shares right now, oh, I could buy them at $640 a share.  Why would I want to do that?  It's at $589.  Oh, why didn't you buy one at $644?  You thought it was going to keep going up.  Oh, yeah.  You could have made $4.  What I would do, Anthony, is I would buy one share and sell it and take $4-ities and  treat myself to an evening out.  Oh, you're fucked. 
[03:00:30]  How many shares are we?  Yeah, I'm out.  How many shares?  You buy contracts with options, and a contract is 100-share bunch of the thing.  How many bunches do you buy?  I bought 15 bunches.  Oh, fuck.  But now, here's the thing, and this is why you do options.  It's not $640 a share to buy it.  You could buy them for $38 an option.  So, it's $38 to leverage the shares. 
[03:01:00]  I'm so confused.  So, you don't have to invest as much with options, but the risk is there because there's  an expiration.  Like, if I just bought Apple shares, I'd have them, and then I'd wait for them to go up.  But now, they have to do something before my deadline.  So, you still have a month.  Yeah, I got a month.  What if they shoot to $700?  You can do it immediately?  You can jump out immediately, right?  I could jump out at any time, I could sell my options, or I could exercise the options.  So, you'd have to spend, like, a $1,500, so you'd have to buy 1,500 shares at $650? 
[03:01:30]  Well, no.  They do it automatically.  You don't literally have to have the money because you're flipping it when you do that.  So, if it went up to $700, I would buy the shares at $650 a share, and then get the money  back immediately, and the account does that.  You don't literally have to have all that money.  So, you're not actually buying them and selling them.  You're selling them first, really, getting the money, and then paying for the shares that  you had outstanding as an option.  It's just gambling.  It really is. 
[03:02:00]  And it's not?  It doesn't help the country at all?  It's gambling.  Does options trade help the country?  Maybe I'm wrong.  I don't know.  I never really gave the ramifications of the nation any thought, Jimmy, as I'm sitting  here bleeding.  But I'm not saying you should.  I don't mean that at all shitting on you.  I would do it.  But I'm almost saying, as we look at the mess that we're in, what is that?  I can see, again, investing in a company and buying shares, but options trading, what  is it at its root?  I guess it helps e-trade.  At its root, what is it? 
[03:02:30]  At its root.  Boy, you know.  If you explain what buying stock is, I don't know much about it, but while you're buying,  you're investing in the company.  And the company gets to use the money that you've invested to hopefully make the company  better, increase the share price, and you're investing in the company.  Now, options, I don't know.  It's...  This is all about the e-book suit.  It's all like your...  There's an e-book suit.  Lawsuit?  Yeah.  Why?  Lawsuit, actually.  That's there.  That's probably why Apple's plummeting.  That's what I'm saying.  They're having some fucking problem with e-books, saying that they've ripped off the Amazon... 
[03:03:00]  We have an option to either stay...  Oh, right.  ...or go home.  Exercising my option to go home and go in my pool.  You want to do that?  It's going to be 90 degrees today or something.  It is going to be like 90.  Yeah.  All right.  Chop, chop.  Jim, you got anything?  Cincinnati this weekend?  Oh, yes.  I didn't realize I was just so late.  Cincinnati this Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  If you're going to Cleveland, don't go to Cincinnati because it's three hours away or more.  Three and a half.  It's not...  Just wait until Cleveland. 
[03:03:30]  But anyone in that Cincinnati area or Kentucky.  It's actually in Kentucky.  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I'm just working out stuff at the special.  Nice.  And I feel very good about it.  And I can't wait to get to fucking Cleveland, dude.  I've switched the whole order around.  Yeah.  I'm just literally...  I'm doing the middle first, the first...  I'm all over the place.  We're all excited about that, so...  And I tried to get...  I feel so fucking terrible that Sam, E-Rock, and a couple other guys have to come back  Saturday morning. 
[03:04:00]  I was willing to pay for that room.  That is fucking bullshit.  I was going to pay for the room myself.  I can't look into it.  I'm like, fuck it.  I'll buy them rooms for that night.  I'm trying to be a good boy, but...  But...  Recently, an article came out showing how much money these fucking guys  are making, and then they turn around and they can't even give an extra hotel room  to our guys so they could see Jimmy perform in Cleveland.  Yeah.  It's just mind-boggling.  And meanwhile, those guys could have grabbed audio, and they would all have stories to  come back with.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's mind-boggling. 
[03:04:30]  So, these guys are our support staff that you know and love.  They are flying up Friday, and they're coming home Saturday morning.  And I was out so...  It's just ridiculous.  I'm so out...  Fucking...  I'm so aggravated at that.  I'm so disappointed that I said to Kenny, check into it.  I'll pay for it.  Don't even say anything.  And the only reason I'm mentioning it on air is because literally...  Hi, Dan.  Dan's in studio.  The fucking hotel...  It was too much money to switch the flights because we bought early, and there's a big 
[03:05:00]  fee, and there's new airfares.  Well, Jim, your fee...  I'm staying.  Oh!  But I have to pay for my own hotel.  How much is the hotel room?  Whatever Kenny's rate is.  Whatever it is.  I'll take care of it.  Oh, no.  Are you kidding me?  No, no.  I'm going to.  I told Kenny I was going to anyway.  Because there's no way I would have offered Sam and those guys, and then not paid for  you and Troy.  I just wanted to, too.  I want to do it.  Why can't they take care of their employees?  I'll take care of it.  I don't even want to.  We're basic shit.  That was something I planned on.  You fly up for the live broadcast, and then you're not allowed to stay for the reason  we're going up there for? 
[03:05:30]  It's terrible.  It's disgusting what this business has become.  It really is.  If it wasn't 10 o'clock or after 10, I sure would stick around and voice my opinion  on the whole thing.  But just so you know, I tried to get that done, and it was just too expensive with the  airfare switches and the fucking change fees.  So in the end, you don't give a shit.  I'm dying.  I'm dying.  Is that what you're saying?  No, I'm paying for the...  Jimmy's saying, literally, Jimmy's saying, fuck those guys.  What I would have done is, if there was a few of them, I would have doubled them up in  a room for one extra night and just paid for it.  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  I think that's the message today that Jimmy wants.  Jimmy just says, fuck everybody.  But Kenny told me how much the extra rooms would have been for the night.  It's nothing.  And I'm like...  Inconsequential.  What's the number?  I need to know.  I'm trying to think of how much the room is.  It's...  How much is it, Dan?  You know?  How much money did the company...  I think it was something like a buck thirty or something like that.  So basically, a buck thirty a room...  Times how many rooms?  So you could have done four, or you could have said even two rooms.  Would you guys split a room for one night to stay?  Let's say it's three rooms.  Isn't it three?  Or four rooms.  They saved four extra rooms.  That's a little over 500 bucks they needed to save. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Or you could have done...  If you doubled the guys up, like say, hey, look, would you stay one more night?  Holy fuck.  Double up.  Three rooms?  Three times 130?  It's four bucks.  I'll stay with Travis.  Thank you.  But you know what I'm saying?  Like, that would have been...  I think the guys would have done that for one night just to have the extra night in Cleveland  and hang and all go out to eat and fucking, you know?  Or just do what he did.  Go on the five-star vacation.  Go with...  What is it?  He went overseas.  Who did?  Yeah, but that's...  Oh.  That's his money. 
[03:07:00]  I'm talking about the company's money.  I just spit all over the computer screen.  It's hilarious.  Because I have no idea what Roland just said.  I know.  And it made me laugh.  I don't know if anybody can see how much spit is on that screen.  It was a wet fucking computer screen.  The company needed to save $520.  Yeah, it's...  That's despicable.  Yep.  All right, leave the car running, Kenny.  I'll be right down.  Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.  See you tomorrow.  Fuck.  The Opie Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over. 
[03:07:30]  But if you feel like sticking around after One Day Live is next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next. </pre>
