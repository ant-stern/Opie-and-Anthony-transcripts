<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, engaging in their typical vulgar self-deprecation, insulting themselves and their crew (Greg, Tony, James, Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, and E-Rock). They announced upcoming shows in Detroit, Columbus, and Rochester.  The show then heavily criticized the *Sopranos* finale, deeming it underwhelming and lacking the expected violence, describing it as a "Father Knows Best" ending.  They contrasted this disappointment with their anticipation for *Entourage* and Jim Norton's *Lucky Louie*. Opie detailed a disastrous basement flood in his apartment, lambasting his unresponsive landlord with numerous offensive terms. This led to a discussion of his plans to find better housing.  He also recounted seeing Wolfmother, praising the band and predicting their success, comparing them to Nirvana; losing his digital camera with embarrassing photos; a brief encounter with Don Vito from the BAM show on the New Jersey Turnpike; and an awkward attempt to appear on WYSP radio in Philadelphia, where he felt ignored by Cousin Ed.  The entire segment was punctuated by tangents and offensive jokes.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about a restaurant reservation secured through a host's "celebrity status," followed by a darkly humorous segment mocking the 25th anniversary of AIDS with a fabricated 1970s/80s diet pill commercial using the acronym "AIDS," and a joke about a radio personality buying the fictional pills at auction.  A news story about an elderly couple stabbed after answering a door for a pen borrower sparked a discussion about urban paranoia and security, contrasted with the famously unlocked doors of Lakeside, Ohio.  A Lakeside resident was called in to discuss this.  A significant portion featured a phone call with Frank Vincent (*The Sopranos*), discussing the show's finale and his career.  This segment included more darkly comedic bits: an AIDS singalong, simulated Detroit shootout sound effects, jokes about urban crime, and a caller who’d driven off the road laughing at the show, leading to a discussion about reckless driving.  The segment concluded with a discussion on the arbitrariness of awareness ribbons.

The next segment began with a caller discussing white ribbons at a Queens College graduation, sparking a discussion on political correctness and accusations of racism.  This segued into more discussion about the absurdity of awareness ribbons (diabetes, colon cancer).  A significant portion focused on the news report about Lakeside, Ohio, with humorous speculation on the potential dangers and staged nature of the report, including off-color jokes about pedophiles.  Studio guest Francine delivered news segments (Iran's oil threats, O.J. Simpson sex tape) interspersed with crude jokes and commentary from the hosts, who made frequent vulgar remarks about Francine.  A promotional event for *The Omen* went awry when six women in bikinis with barely visible "666" markings walked from the studio to XM Radio; the hosts mocked their appearance and the promotional strategy with repeated vulgar and offensive descriptions. A listener called in to discuss this event.

The show then focused on Mary Carey’s radio persona, followed by the 25th anniversary of AIDS awareness and an in-studio performance of "Full Blown AIDS" (FBA) by Stephen Lynch (with Jay Moore and Mike DiNicola).  They discussed the song’s creation and popularity.  Listener feedback, often crude and sexually suggestive, followed, along with tangents about Opie’s past rants, a printing issue, and a planned motorcycle trip to Boston involving numerous women. Listener calls about a contest to find a hidden "666" on a woman's body, along with comments about strippers and porn stars were also discussed.  A phone call with Howie Mandel promoting *Deal or No Deal* was interspersed with a conversation about Patty, a 51-year-old virgin with a gynecological exam phobia.  The hosts and Mandel engaged in a lengthy, crude, and sexually suggestive discussion with Patty about her anxieties, virginity, and lack of medical checkups, culminating in attempts to convince her to use a sex toy in the studio.

A later segment centered on Patty's online dating profile, with the hosts and E-Rock making numerous crude and sexually charged comments. They also discussed a man named Tim who claimed to have unusually long testicles, encouraging Patty to examine and touch them, leading to sexually explicit discussion and interaction.  They analyzed Patty's online dating messages and "winks," commenting on other users and their interest in Patty, noting that responding required credit card information. The segment culminated with Patty using a vibrator while the hosts provided sexually explicit commentary and instructions, leading to numerous sexually graphic descriptions and sounds.  Technical difficulties with microphones occurred throughout.

The final segment featured Patty, the 51-year-old virgin, describing her experience of using a vibrator while the hosts provided real-time instructions and commentary using crude and sexually explicit language.  The process was described in graphic detail, and several callers joined in with encouragement, jokes, and sexually suggestive remarks.  Jimmy, another host, also participated, holding the vibrator at one point. The segment concluded with Patty seemingly experiencing an orgasm, leading to enthusiastic reactions from the hosts and callers, followed by further sexually explicit comments and jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202.  O.P. and Anthony!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  O.P. and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We...  Dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We care like Chuck.  No!  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating poop that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Eric? 
[00:01:00]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Hour.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Hey, a couple of more people.  We're saying hi to people in Detroit, Columbus, Rochester.  And Rochester for now.  I almost started naming off a lot of other cities.  Other cities that, what, we don't have yet?  Well, Washington in a couple of weeks from today.  A couple of weeks.  Two or three weeks from today.  But today we say hi to Detroit, Columbus, and Rochester as the O&A virus spreads to those 
[00:02:00]  fine cities.  I got a lot of emails from people in Detroit.  Psyched.  The show's going to be on.  And is on right now.  There you go.  There you go.  Yes, it's on WXYT AM 1270.  I love the amplitude modulation.  Love it.  Big fan of the AM.  Who doesn't?  It's great.  I'm kidding.  But. 
[00:02:30]  Hey, it's something.  AM.  AM's great.  You know the history behind AM radio?  It's wonderful.  I'll tell you all about it.  I'd rather not know the history.  Right?  If that's how you feel, fine, too.  And now there's people that work at that station.  They're all excited.  Now they're all in their eyes.  No, don't worry.  Great.  Now let's say hi to everyone listening to us on WXYT AM 1270 in Detroit.  The big wazoo in Columbus, Ohio. 
[00:03:00]  Hello, wazoo.  We're back on the big wazoo in Columbus, Ohio.  And the zone in Rochester, right?  For now.  For now.  Well, I'm wide awake because I went to bed at 730 last night.  730?  Now why on earth would you go to sleep at 730, Opie, when you know on Sunday you cannot go to sleep before 10 p.m. like I did?  But I figured I'd sacrifice my energy today, although I'll fake it very well. 
[00:03:30]  But I am really tired because I have to stay up.  I know what you're getting at, and I thought about it.  I weighed the situation.  I'm like, do I get a good night's sleep for once, or do I stay up and watch The Sopranos?  God.  And I laugh at every single one of you that decided to stay up late and watch The Sopranos.  All right.  Look, Kreskin.  I understand.  Kreskin, I gave up on the season five episodes ago.  I understand.  So did I for the most part.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Do you? 
[00:04:00]  Ugh.  What's on Showtime?  The homo stuff was hysterical.  The thing is, this was what amounts to a season finale.  They're not coming back until next year.  So I assumed, silly ass me, assumed that something was going to happen.  Something exciting, a twist, a cliffhanger, something that would have kept me interested.  As the clock ticked by, I'm like, all right, nine o'clock, it starts, 9.15, just some filler 
[00:04:30]  and backstory crap and everything.  9.30, 9.40.  Oh, a Dr. Melfi scene.  Jesus Christ.  Can you have enough of this?  Why do you think you do things like that, Anthony?  I don't know, because she's stupid.  Back and forth.  They go back.  Who cares about the Dr. Melfi scene?  And then I'm looking.  I look at the TV.  I look at the clock out of the corner of my eye and I go, it's getting to the end. 
[00:05:00]  I'm looking.  9.52.  I went, oh, my God, nothing's going to happen.  And then when they're in the living room talking, and it's like a Christmas scene.  Yeah.  And when she says, yes, we do, and the camera starts to pull back, I'm like, no.  No.  No.  Unless you're fading back onto two guys with machine guns hiding behind the screen.  No.  It's the slow fade out to end the season.  It's the every season ending family together to show that even though they went through 
[00:05:30]  all this, that there's still a family, blah, blah, shoot somebody.  I understand it's not all about shoot them up and they want more than that.  How about some shoot them up?  But does it have to be Father Knows Best?  At the end of every season finale, it's Father Knows Best.  That's the big surprise.  They don't approve of AJ's relationship.  We have to wait until January to see what happens.  Oh, my God, to see how it works out with the Puerto Rican girl with the baby.  Wow.  I could watch Days of Our Lives and get that drivel. 
[00:06:00]  All right, I do.  Looks like I look like a genius today.  Yeah, you were the one.  And I was debating, but I'm thinking this season has just been boring to me.  I couldn't because it was the season finale, and God forbid something happened, I would  have had to sit here and watch 20 people on instant feedback and the phones ruin it.  Spoilers.  Frank Vincent had a great line, though.  Frank Vincent did have a good line.  He had a couple of them, but one of them was...  During the sit-down? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  That one, and also when he's with his wife, he goes, you're breaking my balls about clams.  About clams?  Stop breaking my balls about clams.  He's calling in today at 7.30, so...  Yeah, he, like, had the best scenes out of it.  He's got some of the best dialogue.  No update on Johnny Sack in prison?  Sacks were a stupid...  No.  What about Paulie Walnuts?  Why did they stop with him?  He was great this year.  He was great, and then he went away, right?  No, he said nothing.  They did a big Paulie Walnuts lead-up story.  I'm done with the Sopranos. 
[00:07:00]  With the Sopranos.  Go have your...  Until January.  Until January, then they'll finish that off, and then watch.  They'll have to make a full-feature film.  I'm so done.  I say goodbye to the Sopranos.  Hello, Entourage, and hello, Lucky Louie.  Ooh!  I love Entourage.  I can't get into Entourage.  It's too, uh...  Entourage is a great show.  Dude, it's the OC with cursing.  It's a great show, Entourage.  I can't get into the Entourage.  I'm not familiar with it.  I mean, it's funny. 
[00:07:30]  I get this stupid thing in the mail from HBO.  Oh, what was that?  A premiere or something on Wednesday night?  Do I want to go to the premiere of Entourage?  I don't know.  Oh!  Being that you're going to be on a show...  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Question?  Yes?  Yes, Opie?  Can I go with you?  I'm not going to go.  Then give me the pass.  It's good for two.  I mean, what am I going to do?  No, he's going.  Who am I going to bring?  You're going.  You have to go to the premiere of Entourage.  And then Lucky Louie, Jim Norton's show right after Entourage starting this Sunday.  Next Sunday, yeah.  I'm very, very excited.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Saw the first episode already, and I liked it.  I didn't.  I liked it.  Why didn't I see the first episode?  Where's your copy?  Where's my copy?  We have many copies.  Why didn't I get one?  Someone's head must roll.  We'll get you one.  There's plenty.  They were all over the joint.  So Entourage, Lucky Louie, and then, yes, Torghazm with Dane Cook and our pal Bob Kelly.  All starts this coming Sunday on HBO.  That's going to be a lot of fun to check out.  But screw The Sopranos.  Done. 
[00:08:30]  No, I can't be done with it.  Done.  Now I'm so angry that I want to see something happen.  So I'll watch the-  Did they kill anybody last night?  No.  Well, they almost killed Frank Vincent with a heart attack.  It's like, I don't want to see that.  I want to see a whacking.  It started off great, right, with a big explosion, and Frank Vincent and this chick are walking  across the street, and he's giggling, he's being a gentleman, and you're like, oh, they're  dead.  Yeah.  I thought it was dead.  Bomb goes off, and you're like, all right, well, this is going to get heated.  Blows him back on the street, but he's okay.  Yeah.  And that's pretty much it. 
[00:09:00]  That was the whole thing.  It was just-  How many minutes did they spend on Christopher doing drugs?  I like the storyline where Christopher was banging the girl that Tony kind of wanted  to rehearse?  Yeah.  It was really beautiful.  That I kind of liked a lot.  But speed it up.  The montage they did of those two smoking whatever they were smoking.  I'm guessing it was freebasing or something.  A little crystal.  It was horrible.  Crystal meth in there as well, I think.  It was just, it went on and on enough. 
[00:09:30]  They gave me nothing last night except less sleep than I should have gotten.  I got lots of sleep.  Bastard.  Have fun talking to Frank Vincent in an hour.  I'll be sitting back enjoying a cup of coffee.  Curse him.  Carmella, there was the part where Carmella, like, is she going to get to sell this house,  the real estate or job, or will she not get it?  Boring.  Boring.  No.  Boring.  It's a woman's career to me.  Boring.  Tony, my spec house. 
[00:10:00]  Who cares about your spec house?  I thought you said spec house until AJ dated her.  So what's the cliffhanger?  There wasn't one.  They have to have some kind of cliffhanger.  All I could see that was even remotely, that even remotely looked like a cliffhanger was  Tony goes to Frank Vincent in the hospital and kind of tries to fill him in on life.  That was a good scene.  That was a good scene.  By the way, whatever happened to Uncle Junior?  Because I truly gave up on the Sopranos.  Bacalov visited Junior. 
[00:10:30]  I didn't watch the last five episodes.  What?  He had the line of the show.  He really did have the line of the show.  Bobby Bacalov visited Junior to give him back money that he had given him because he  wants, you know, no part of him.  Everybody's abandoned him.  Uh, and, uh, Uncle Junior thought that Bobby was coming to visit him for Christmas, but  he was just coming to, like, cut all ties, give back his present, and, uh, and leave.  So what does he say, Uncle Junior?  I don't remember the line with Bobby.  I'm thinking of another line probably.  Oh, which one? 
[00:11:00]  With, with, with, when he's sitting there cranky, and he, and, and the, there's an,  the black male nurse behind him goes, uh, what's his name, his first name?  Begins with a C?  Whatever.  Good one.  Yeah, he says, uh, whatever.  You got nothing to do, it's Christmas, he's alone.  And, and, and, and the woman behind him goes, you could always make a, and Al, get ready.  Uh, just letting you know, the woman behind him goes, uh, you could always make a, uh,  a hand turkey, and he goes, for Christmas?  Fucking idiot.  A hand turkey.  It was so disgusting. 
[00:11:30]  And she was so wounded.  She looked like Margaret Hassan, the woman that was shot by, uh, by Alzar Cowies.  And, uh, she was so wounded.  He was so disgusted.  He was so disgusted at the thought of making a hand turkey, this old mobster.  Guy ran a mafia family, he's gonna make a hand turkey for Christmas.  Ah, too good.  Uh.  Started going off about, do you know what bakalai is?  Yeah.  Salted cod.  We taught the world to eat.  We taught the world to eat. 
[00:12:00]  The ass.  So, I, uh, I, I, I was too busy, uh, cleaning out my basement instead of watching The Sopranos.  Ooh.  Well, that sounds like, uh, fun.  You know what I, uh, realized, uh, yesterday?  It rained like the Pacific Northwest?  Yeah, it was Seattle here in New York for, uh, two or three straight days, right?  When did the rain start?  Somewhere on Friday?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But when I started looking at my shotgun as a viable option to the weather, I'm like, 
[00:12:30]  I, I, I hate it when it just rained.  And look, here's our, uh, five-day forecast.  We're looking on the news.  Nothing but rain coming down.  Rain every other day here in New York City.  Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  Sunday, Saturday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  I want to thank my ass of a landlord for not calling me back after my crisis yesterday.  You prick.  Another crisis in the, at the Opie Manor.  You prick.  This guy, he's, uh, you know, when he calls me, hey, uh, you know, uh, when you, when you 
[00:13:00]  send, uh, next month's, uh, a rent check out, could you, uh, could you, uh, you know, sign  a picture?  I have a few people that are big fans of the show.  Ugh.  I haven't done that once.  And then this guy is trying to, like, uh, help, he's trying to get involved with my brother's  restaurant in Huntington.  Ah, they call that a shyster here in New York.  Because he's, he insures restaurants, I guess.  That's part of his other business.  Oh, he insures, that must be nice.  So he's been calling my brother, you know, F.H. Riley's, Huntington, 400 New York Avenue 
[00:13:30]  in the village there.  It's a great place.  He's been calling him like crazy because he wants to, you know, get that business and  insure the restaurant.  And he's been using, you know, your brother, uh, you know, uh, he rents from me.  And then I have a major crisis, another major crisis, and the guy doesn't even call me  back.  Does he have, uh, Tommy and Hendry sitting out in front of the place every so often as smoke  pours out talking about, I'm trying to date this Jew broad.  Oh, you're decorating a Christmas tree. 
[00:14:00]  If you've been a fan of this show, you guys have heard the stories over the years.  The fireplace that doesn't work, where I smoked out the whole joint with the lava, uh, the  Javalog story.  Trying to have a romantic evening.  Easy.  Oh, that's right.  That was when Jay was over.  Easy.  Forgot about that.  And then I had the pipe burst in the, uh, in the kitchen that, that had a, uh, river of  water that completely, uh, collapsed the, the basement, uh, ceiling right onto my computer.  And you can't forget the mice.  Uh, I've killed, uh, to this day, about 20 mice. 
[00:14:30]  You're an ace.  At least 20, uh, meeses.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, well, yesterday, you know, and the guy never told me that the basement floods  when, when we get torrential, uh, downpours like we did, like we did the last couple of  days.  So every once in a while, my basement, it'll just kind of start sweating and the water  will, the water will seep up, seep up just a little, a couple puddles usually, a little  more than that sometimes, quick mop up, it's a drag and you move on.  Personally, I, I wish I would have known this before I moved into his, his crap hole. 
[00:15:00]  Well, half of your apartment is downstairs.  Yeah.  Well, and because of the hours we keep, I had to move my, uh, my whole bedroom downstairs  because it's, you know, I'm on a bottom floor apartment and you hear the people walking  outside my, what, what, what was supposed to be the bedroom.  Yeah.  Because they're normal people.  They're still awake at nine o'clock at night.  So you have an actual basement.  It's a finished basement.  Yeah.  In Manhattan.  You know what I realized yesterday? 
[00:15:30]  I'm a millionaire.  I got to start living like a millionaire.  You are?  I'm a multi-millionaire.  Multi?  And I live like I just freaking got out of college.  I've had it.  I have had it.  I was, I was talking to Bob yesterday about some things because, uh, super agent, Bob  Eatman.  Cause I have been looking into, you know, buying something, something here in Manhattan  finally.  Right.  And, uh, and I go, Bob, let's be honest.  I, I live below my means. 
[00:16:00]  And he goes, you think he's even giving me, you know, crap.  You live below my means.  Cause listen to what I had to do yesterday.  So the basement, like I said, it sweats every once in a while.  And when it rains a lot, you know, the water does rise a bit, but it's manageable.  It's manageable.  If you're making $28,000 a year that you have actually talked yourself into that being  manageable, it shows something that's manageable.  You know, throwing a mouse in, into the garbage every once in a while is manageable. 
[00:16:30]  Killing a cockroach every once in a while, manageable now having homeless people outside  what was supposed to be my bedroom, uh, sleeping right outside my window, manageable, rummaging  through the garbage, throwing on the, uh, the faucet that is literally four inches off  the ground so they could shower.  They'll stick their head under there manageable, but yesterday wasn't manageable.  So I'm upstairs, uh, Lindsay and I are on the couch and, um, just hanging out watching 
[00:17:00]  TV and I hear a, you know, when you're like at work, those big water jugs and when you  have to, you know, place a new water cooler, the water cooler.  And when you've placed it on top for the first time, you hear two huge, you know, bubbles  go, whatever.  I can't do the freaking noises.  You know what I'm saying?  Close enough.  So I hear that and I'm like, that's weird.  And I, I hear like, it might be coming from another apartment or outside or possibly downstairs. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Maybe downstairs.  And I also hear a noise at the same time, but there's noises all over the place.  I'm thinking maybe the freaking, you know, mice are having a barbecue somewhere in the  walls.  Who knows?  So I don't think anything of it.  And then I'm kind of tired, you know, I'm like, Lindsay, you want to, you know, you want  to just take a nap or whatever?  She goes, yeah.  So I go down, I start walking down the stairs to my bedroom and the lights are completely  off.  It's pitch dark, but there's like a little basement window and I see a reflection off the  floor.  I'm like, oh my God, that can only mean one thing. 
[00:18:00]  Either someone installed mirrors in the middle of the night or that's water.  Water on the floor.  So I, I, uh, all of a sudden you're in a video game.  So I turn on the light.  There is at least, and I'm not exaggerating, at least four inches of water throughout the  entire basement, wrecking a crap load of stuff, by the way, because, because I don't  have, I don't, I don't have, uh, room to, to, to put things.  So they've been in piles on the basement and it has, and the basement hasn't, uh, uh, you 
[00:18:30]  know, leaked in a while.  So once again, I must reprimand you.  Why?  You should never have stuff on your basement floor, especially one known to leak.  I understand that Mr. Perfect.  I'm not Mr. Perfect.  I've learned through my mistakes too.  I understand that.  So then I'm like, where did all this water come from?  Right.  And that's when I saw the wall, uh, completely gone, uh, like a three to four foot section  from the floor up about a foot completely gone. 
[00:19:00]  The bubble noises I heard was the wall giving out because the water had to go somewhere.  The water built up between your wall and outside.  Yeah.  And then just broke.  So the bubbles I'm hearing is the wall finally giving out because the water needs to go somewhere.  So the whole bottom of the wall in this section just collapsed inward, inward toward, you know,  to the basement.  So the water could get out.  You know, you, you live in a slum.  Yes.  It's what's called a slum. 
[00:19:30]  And I got a slum landlord.  So I call him and I used about, I don't know, eight Fs, two MFs, three Ss, three SHs.  And you popped it off with a silly goose.  And I'm like, you know, something has to be done here, obviously.  And I, cause I almost got electrocuted cause I didn't even realize how much water, the  water's up near the outlets.  Everything's plugged in.  Oh, you don't step in the water then.  And the douchebag doesn't even call me back. 
[00:20:00]  Doesn't even call me back.  Well, with the nice messages you left, I'm sure.  You should leave that place, get into a hotel, put your possessions in storage until you find  a place and then do nothing but blast him on the air and ruin his life.  So then I'm in the water up to my, at this point, up to my ankles cause I'm just mopping.  Actually just like one of those mop sponge things where dip it in the water, wring it  out, dip it in the water, wring it out.  Five ounces at a time. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Repeat 10,000 times, by the way, 10,000 times.  I took out five or six huge buckets of water.  Like the biggest bucket, you know, I have these really huge buckets filled right to the tippy  top.  And I'm in the water on my cell phone getting, cause now I'm getting Bob into the, uh, into  the action, our agent.  And I'm telling him like, I'm looking for places in New York, you know, and, and I found  one that I really do like.  I just want to like, uh, look into it further. 
[00:21:00]  And he's like, well, you know, uh, you know, if you decide to have kids and, and, and, and,  and people, uh, you know, uh, are going to want to stay with you and stuff.  Well, you know, that place is just not going to be big enough.  I'm like, will you shut up?  I'm not thinking, see, Bob is so much more conservative than Ant and I.  That's why we love the guy.  Cause he takes care of the side in our brains that you and I just don't have.  Yeah.  You know, that, that reasonable thinking that we just, uh, lack that reasoning.  And I'm like, Bob, who cares what's going to happen in four or five years? 
[00:21:30]  All I know is I like the place.  There is a guest room.  And then there is another area that is, could be possibly turned into another bedroom if possible.  And nursery.  And here's the key.  Here's the key.  It's 27 stories up.  At least.  There you go.  No leak in there.  No mice.  The mice don't want to go up that high.  Mice get tired.  They get tired.  Nothing's going to flood.  It's so high up.  You don't even get rain.  No.  You were telling me before we went on the air. 
[00:22:00]  You look down on the clouds.  Yeah.  You're so high.  You're seeing the rain clouds below you.  You see sunshine and aircraft and go, it must be raining down there.  Where the poor people are.  The only problem I want is problems with eagles.  Problems with eagles that might be nesting in the outdoor portion of this apartment, by the way.  And then have all the animal rights activists pointing their stupid telescopes at the eagle nest in my apartment.  At Pelican.  That's the problem I want.  That's the problem I want.  So I spent, I don't know, all afternoon pretty much just cleaning up the basement. 
[00:22:30]  If it didn't rain every goddamn day, the whole weekend, shot.  But here's the scary part about this basement situation.  Now it's cleaner than it's ever been because I cleaned it all up.  I mopped ammonia over and over again.  Like, I can't believe how clean it looks down there.  Threw out thousands of dollars worth of stuff.  Thousands of dollars of stuff, Ira.  What stuff?  Ira.  Ira.  Yuck. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  No rent checked for you.  No rent checked for you in July, Ira.  Ira.  I suspect.  And the last name comes tomorrow if you don't call me back.  Uh-oh.  Ira.  I bet I could guess the last name.  There's a steen in it.  Good old Ira.  Good old Ira was paranoid that because, you know, we're public figures that, oh, the paparazzi were going to be hanging outside his building.  No, no.  You're going to have O&A pest hanging outside your personal home. 
[00:23:30]  Uh-oh.  He won't like that.  Ira won't care for you.  Ira doesn't get his rent check in July.  Trust me.  Oy vey.  And I'm still adding up the total.  I don't think you get a rent check for August either, Ira.  You ever hold back a rent check on him?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes, because there was a rug that was destroyed.  Uh, when I put down a nice rug in the basement and I was destroyed by flood water.  That wouldn't work.  So, uh, what was I saying with this whole thing?  Uh, blah, blah, blah.  I don't know.  That it's just flooded. 
[00:24:00]  Hi.  There was, no, I had a grand finale here, but now I can't remember.  Because stupid Tom Chiasano had to tell me we have to break.  Right in the middle of my rant.  Thank you.  Yeah, commercials are more important than my flooded basement.  We've reached the point of stupid Tom Chiasano in one month.  No, everyone is stupid and everyone.  Wow.  Everyone's a dummy today.  Because I'm really, really pissed off with what happened.  I don't know.  I'll try to remember.  Thank God you didn't watch The Sopranos.  No. 
[00:24:30]  No, there was a big cliffhanger on The Sopranos.  I forgot to mention.  They showed Johnny Cakes and he was looking at a mustache trimmer and you're like, no,  don't.  But then it fades to black.  By the way, I had to throw out my Spuds Buckley tape.  Yesterday.  No.  The mouth took a bite out of it and threw up.  Oh, all right.  This is it really fast.  So I cleaned up the whole basement.  Okay.  And it's spotless.  Here's the problem, though.  The big, huge hole where the wall collapsed.  I don't know what's in there.  So even though I went to bed nice and early and I was sleeping, I was waking up every hour, 
[00:25:00]  an hour and a half wondering, you know, because your mind plays tricks on you, wondering  if the rats have decided, wow, this is a nice, big hole.  That would be a nice.  Because I told you the basement, the bedroom where I hear the mice above me.  Yeah.  You know, and now this big hole is not too far from where I usually hear stuff.  So now I'm wondering what's going to start crawling out of this hole.  Crawling.  How about falling, like, in big piles of rat, just tumbling into your bedroom? 
[00:25:30]  And someone's saying, just buy a house, Opie.  I'm trying.  That part of this, I am trying.  I've looked at about 30 places in Manhattan so far.  I would get out of there and, you know, I'd say a hotel for a month is expensive.  All right.  Let's still get out of there.  We better take a break.  Just stay with me.  Probably.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  You can stay on my couch.  Ooh.  That could be the welcoming committee for all the prostitutes.  That's right.  You could do the pre-screen.  I could be, like, your father making sure they're good enough for you.  Yeah.  He's in that room over there. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Let's take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  And it has spread to Detroit, Columbus, and Rochester this morning.  So, once again, hello to those fine cities.  Okay?  Right.  You're going to check it out, the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Listening to some Wolf Mother in the background.  I went and saw a Wolf Mother over the weekend here in New York City. 
[00:26:30]  I was blown away.  Blown away.  Suck.  They're great, man.  They're from Australia.  And I got to tell you, everyone was blown away at the show on Saturday night.  I think we may be looking at a Nirvana type of situation here.  That's a bold statement.  Like a Nirvana type of situation.  Let's be honest.  Rock has been kind of boring the last five or six years, right?  Why do you say that? 
[00:27:00]  It's been such great music.  Yeah, name it.  I think that my girlfriend does like me.  I went to her house and she said...  How many bands sound like that?  Every rock and roller wears, like, knee-length shorts and tries to be socially conscious.  And they're a bunch of...  Rockets!  Well, Wolf Mother, they're going old school.  And I don't think they're going to... 
[00:27:30]  I don't think it's going to be a Nirvana situation like Nirvana was, where they just blew everybody away and made a lot of bands retire.  But I think they're the type of band that's going to make a lot of people take notice.  And I think you're going to see a bunch of other bands like Wolf Mother coming onto the scene.  Get rid of some of the faggot music.  Yeah, they're going to get rid of the faggots!  Nirvana kind of created a genre.  They were like the ones at the forefront of what we call Cherno and all that.  Right, right.  Whereas this band is good, but they're more like just reminding you of what you liked about rock. 
[00:28:00]  Like, oh my god, yeah, I did love those.  Yeah, these guys obviously listen to their parents' records.  Yeah, good.  And have decided, yeah, that music is alright.  The 70s is alive and well with Wolf Mother.  But they also are doing their own thing and they've updated the sound a bit.  Yeah, they got updated.  But they had the Moe synthesizer at the concert.  Whoa.  And the dude is just jamming on the synthesizer like the old days.  Man!  And the lead singer, I don't even know their names yet, but the lead singer is doing like the windmills. 
[00:28:30]  Windmill them with the microphone?  Well, no, he did it with the mic like Roger Daltrey.  And then he's doing the Pete Townsend windmills.  Oh, wow.  And then he's doing all sorts of kind of rock poses on the stage.  But then their music is really, really good.  Wait, what's the Pete Townsend windmill when you have like lubricant in one hand and a rattle in the other?  But I don't know.  Your lawyer on the phone?  There's something going on with this band.  They're just blowing up in front of our eyes.  And they were supposed to come in and play.  But between the time we scheduled them and the day they were supposed to come in here, they just have blown up. 
[00:29:00]  They had to take a red eye from L.A. because I guess they did the MTV, which one's coming out?  Movie awards, music, movie awards, right?  So they were doing that.  They had to take a red eye just to do their New York date and then fly.  I think then they went down to Philly last night.  So they weren't here when we were on the air?  They just had to reschedule because they got bigger gigs.  You know, I mean, you got to understand that because they were, we were on to the Wolf Mother thing a long time ago. 
[00:29:30]  You guys remember.  And we're like, hey, get them in studio.  And we had them.  But then they just blew up.  You know, so instead they had to fly out to L.A. to the movie awards or something.  But they're promising us that later this summer they're going to come in and play.  But I don't see it happening.  I think these guys are just going to just completely take off.  The Chili Peppers were supposed to come in.  And leave us.  But they're doing that.  It's like a 70s rock meets kind of like some of the things that like the White Stripes does.  It's a really, really interesting sound. 
[00:30:00]  The CD, I can't get enough of it.  I play it almost every day.  It's Wolf Mother.  I'm telling you, I'm feeling there may be some kind of a nirvana situation here where they're going to change music a little bit for everybody and make it exciting again.  I mean, music got so bad that here in New York City they don't even play current rock anymore.  No, there's not.  Except on Free FM here in New York, the station we're being heard on, you know, they play some of the new rock.  But there's also a lot of talk shows here.  Yeah.  There's not one full-time rock station in New York because no one's really excited about music. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, the music isn't that great right now.  The only stuff I like to listen to, like you guys like on XM, you like Fred and Lucy, you like a lot of the newer stuff.  I like the Boneyard, which just plays like a light, like not light metal, but it doesn't play like, you know, death metal.  It's just like Maiden and Sabbath and Kiss.  All the stuff Jimmy loves.  Oh, and then I brought my digital camera to the Wolf Mother show, you know, and I rarely search out a photo, but I really like these guys. 
[00:31:00]  I'm like, I wouldn't mind a photo with Wolf Mother.  And then I decide after the concert to go see Jimmy at, you know, the Cellar, you know, which is a great comedy club in New York.  And I was talking to Bob Kelly, and he's showing me pictures on his digital camera about some billboard for tour gas, and that's out there in L.A. on Sunset.  He's real excited.  And then I'm showing him pictures off my camera, and I'm showing Jimmy some pictures I took while I was at WYSP over the weekend. 
[00:31:30]  And I left my camera somewhere, and it has four months of my life on it.  And, no, I did not put these photos anywhere else because I'm a dummy.  Oh, you got to get them right on a computer somewhere.  Can you tell I had an awful weekend?  Do you know what you need, dude?  You need an assistant.  I'm serious.  Oh, you need, because you're very bad at the little day-to-day stuff.  You need an assistant.  Kenny can't be an assistant.  Nah, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny's too, Kenny can't be, you can't have Kenny deal with people. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, Kenny's too stupid.  Kenny's a psychopath.  Yeah, you're too stupid.  No, no, he's not really, well, yeah, maybe.  And then he'd build a corporation, which I'm half of, and I'd be paying for half of Opie's assistant.  So, no, I refuse to allow Kenny to be his assistant.  I'm not paying for half of Opie's assistant.  I could come out of my corporation.  We have three or four corporations each at this point.  One's a drug front.  Don't even take it out of that one.  Your itineraries would be very interesting. 
[00:32:30]  Call Greg.  Ken picks up Jim.  So, my digital kid.  Who's this, Ken?  Get cereal and milk.  But then it's like, go to airport, park car.  Oh, as opposed to leaping out while it's moving?  Check in security.  Ain't no retentive ass.  Oh, he is.  You really are your twichels without the hopping around ruckus.  So, in other words, you guys are saying I'm overqualified.  Yes.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, that must be it. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you.  That's what we're trying to get to, I guess.  Thank you.  His new nickname is 455.  Yeah, only Kenny gets that, of course.  I get it.  Every morning.  Because he's been picking me up lately.  So, every morning, 455.  It's 455, Kenny.  Not 454.  Not 456.  God forbid.  455.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Do you know how many he is, dude?  Every day.  To the point, it's so annoying.  But my digital camera is missing, so someone out there is just having a lot of fun with 
[00:33:30]  three or four months of pictures that I've taken.  Not better.  All the pictures when we first started here at Free FM in New York, the pictures of me  with the Stanley Cup, the pictures of me and my helicopter ride around in Manhattan,  all that gay stuff.  It's all on there.  Bruce Mipman from AAF.  How old are these pictures you got on there?  From my mom's big birthday that we had at FH Riley's.  Dude.  So, since late February.  Doesn't Lindsay have one on there that she probably wants to strangle you for losing the 
[00:34:00]  camera?  Oh, yeah.  A picture of Lindsay and Oprah Winfrey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get it next time.  Yeah, that's not going to cost me.  Yeah, I'll get that picture next time.  It's that next time you're hanging out with Oprah.  Of course.  Yeah, of course.  Dude, I got this little thing.  It's a card reader.  I don't care.  I want my camera back first.  You'll learn from this.  You plug it right in.  You don't have to do any programs.  You just put your card in and it reads it and you upload it.  Next time you do that.  It could be worse.  Do that with your camera and the goddamn USB cable.  You don't even need a USB, though.  I travel.  Oh, no.  You cut it out. 
[00:34:30]  This is just a...  Oh, wait.  This is USB.  I'm sorry.  Of course it is.  You plug in your USB.  I get scared.  And then you get rid of the pictures.  You know, it's hysterical with people these days and they goddamn stupid cameras.  And I'm guilty, too.  You buy these, like, nine megapixel cameras.  You want something nice.  Something that takes a nice picture.  And how does everybody show their pictures?  They don't put them on computer.  They don't print them out.  They don't do anything.  You see it on the little goddamn screen on the camera. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, look at this.  Oh, great.  How much did this cost?  What resolution am I getting this at that I'm looking at this three-inch-wide picture?  And that's how everyone shows pictures now.  It's too lazy to actually put it on your computer, print them out, put it together on DVD, on a disc, and give it to somebody.  Do you know, on my camera, and I do, I've panicked, because I've had photos, like, that I'm worried about losing. 
[00:35:30]  I put them on my computer.  And some of them I'll actually keep on, like, a little digital card, like my Sabbath.  There's a certain one that I, and I got a five megapixel camera, and I took my Sabbath photo in to have it blown up.  And I'm going to have it by tomorrow.  I'm getting it, like, 30 by 19.  Wow.  And I'm going to plug them, Dugal, on 23rd Street.  It's the best photo place I've ever seen in my life.  I got a copy of this.  It's a place Gary Glitter used.  Is it really?  No.  I don't know.  Oh, what a gullible idiot I am.  I'm so happy about my Sabbath photo.  Blowing up his pictures.  I almost wept when I saw how good it looks. 
[00:36:00]  Really?  This is the only reason I have a digital camera.  They tried to do, like, some scan thing.  I'm like, no, just blow it up from the digital.  And then they enhanced it for me because they're a nice people.  That's great.  Well, my digital camera's out there somewhere.  You might get it back, dude.  I checked at the Comedy Cellar, and you've got to check another Nike.  Somebody might have turned it into a different manager.  It has to be at the Comedy Cellar.  Or it's in your apartment.  You put it down.  Because I was at the table just hanging out with Jimmy and Bob Kelly, and we were showing pictures.  Because I took pictures when I was at YSP because I almost stole something for Jimmy.  And then I decided at the last minute to be a good guy for once and not steal it. 
[00:36:30]  And I knew I could get away with it.  I could steal it.  And they would call up here.  I'm like, yeah, I got it for Jimmy.  And they'd be like, all right.  But it was an autographed Black Sabbath poster.  Oh, that's a good one.  They'd say, no, it's the other one we had.  The other one I have is from YSP.  Yeah.  And someone's saying, stop crying this morning.  I'm sorry.  I just had a really bad reason.  Oh, but he's upset about the camera.  He's got every right to be upset.  Then I left the Comedy Cellar, and I drove myself.  So it's not even a cab situation.  So it has to be in the cellar somewhere. 
[00:37:00]  Here's what happened.  I beg you, SD, help me out.  One of two things happened.  Somebody that knows you took the camera, plugged it in, because you got to look and see what's on it,  and said, oh, my God, I got Opie's camera.  Look at all these pictures.  Or it's somebody that you don't know that plugged it in and then went bloop and just erased everything  and now has your camera.  It's pretty much it.  You're not very inspirational.  Well, that's reality, though.  That's a little taste of reality.  That's reality.  I don't – if it was a waitress that found it, she obviously would turn it in. 
[00:37:30]  I mean, a waitress is not going to steal from you there.  Yes, they would.  No, they're nice.  I'm waiting to talk to Bob Kelly.  Maybe he has it and doesn't even realize it.  No.  Because –  What?  No, he doesn't.  Oh, he got a hold of it?  Bob doesn't have it.  Oh, great.  So there comes that.  Bob put some ketchup on it and ate it.  Oh, wow.  Bob lost a few pounds thanks to Fat Smash.  Bob lost about 12 pounds.  You can't see it on him.  What was it?  Maybe Keith said it.  It was like Trump losing 70 bucks at the blackjack table.  It was one of those guys I'm not crediting who it is.  It might have been stupid Keith Robinson. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, because he was explaining he lost weight, but he has this bizarre goatee that must take  like an hour every morning to keep up.  You know how regular white guys we just like, all right, just shave here under the neck.  Good to go.  These guys that make their designs out of their goatee and Bob Kelly's one of them, that's  got to be the biggest thing in the ass.  He's one of the 90s boy bands like sculpted goatees.  It's right around – it's like a little teeny thin one around his mouth.  It's like a target for the food.  Like if someone wants to throw cake at him across the room and just aim for the stupid 
[00:38:30]  brown circle.  He thought way too much about his goatee and he told me the reason he has it is to  make himself look thinner until he loses even more weight because he really can't tell  where his chin is.  Is that going to work?  It's not.  It's kind of just highlighting where the chin is supposed to be.  You want to make yourself look thinner?  How about this?  Wear the Astrodome.  So the digital camera's out there somewhere.  There's a lot of boring pictures on there.  I just want it back.  Uh-oh.  Anything risque on there? 
[00:39:00]  Please tell me you're whacking your bag.  Is there a couple of pictures?  I don't know.  I got to talk to someone later today to see.  Oh, no.  If there is a certain picture that was deleted.  Was it one of those pictures that are like – I wanted to surprise you with this picture  when you looked through the –  Let's just say I got to make a phone call a little while.  Oh, boy.  When someone wakes up.  Please, please – oh, please tell me you're a clown.  Oh, boy. 
[00:39:30]  Please, please tell me there's a photo of you in lingerie.  It's like in JFK.  It's the photo of Clay Shaw and the other one, the two fags at a party.  Take a mover in dresses.  You're all in silver makeup.  There just may be a picture.  I know it's been all about me this first hour, but I did have a weird weekend.  There's one other thing I want to say, and then we can move on.  I went down to Philly.  First of all, I met – what's his name? 
[00:40:00]  Don – what's his name from –  Don Vito?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  From the BAM show.  Yeah, from the BAM show.  I'm on the New Jersey Turnpike, and we're in this merge, so everyone is – it's stop-and-go traffic.  And this massive SUV is to my left, and I see this guy, like, kind of looking and, like, giving me the roll-the-window-down sign.  People still use that?  Yeah.  Where you're cranking a crank?  I know.  It's all power windows, right?  But that doesn't really – you know –  Yeah, you can't just go like this.  You can't just go, hey – and then they're looking down at their tire because you're pointing down. 
[00:40:30]  Well, you have to point forward.  Like, in the caddy, I put my left hand there, and I push my finger forward.  It doesn't go down.  It goes – it goes forward.  That wouldn't be a strong enough signal just to point your finger forward a quarter inch.  No, people don't know what you're doing, so we still use the old crank.  If you do that with your little finger, people would just go, oh, love you in family ties.  And you go, no, that's not the problem.  I'm not twitching.  So I rolled down my window.  It's Don Vito from the BAM show there, and he's a huge fan of this program. 
[00:41:00]  He was freaking out.  Really?  And he's like, I can't believe you guys are back on YSB.  And I'm like, yeah, I'm heading to Philly right now, you know?  I went down there for AJ's graduation, Lindsey's brother.  He's graduated today, actually.  So congrats to AJ.  But anyway, I was downtown in Philly, and I went to dinner.  All of us went to dinner, and then we're looking for something else to do.  And I'm like, man, we're right around the corner from YSP.  We're being heard right now on WYSP in Philly.  So I go to the front door, and we weren't allowed in that joint for, what, four years after we screwed up? 
[00:41:30]  So the security guard, you have to talk through a phone even though he sees you.  I'm like, hi.  Like a prison visit.  Yeah.  I'm like, hi, I'm here to see Matt and Huggy.  Well, they didn't leave your name at the desk.  And who are you anyway?  I'm like, I'm Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  You're Opie?  I'm like, yeah.  And buzzes me in.  Doesn't even question it.  So if you want to go check out YSP and the TV station down there, just say you're Anthony or Jim Norton or Opie.  Or why Anthony now?  Because Opie didn't know.  Then I get in trouble.  Because he's blonde-haired and handsome.  They've already seen him.  Yeah, they already saw me. 
[00:42:00]  So now you've got to use either Anthony or Jimmy.  And they're going to let you right in because they didn't check my ID, right?  And Ben Spark.  So then I go upstairs, and I've got to call someone out.  I don't like calling people out.  Oh, no.  No, it's right.  You never hear it.  It's not like you at all.  So I go upstairs to WISP, and I'm trying to look like a big shot.  I got my girl with me.  I got AJ who's graduating, AJ's girlfriend.  I'm like, look at me.  Look, this is one of the stations I'm being heard on.  Look at this.  You had a posse. 
[00:42:30]  So I go upstairs, and I go into where they broadcast, right?  And Cousin Ed's on the air, and I like Cousin Ed, and I believe he likes us.  Yeah.  And I'm talking to him.  We're small talking for five minutes, and then he does a break.  He does a break right in front of me.  It was very obvious that I wanted to go on WISP on what I guess would be Friday night.  Would have been cool.  It would have been great to say, hey, I'm down in Philly.  It gives them the local angle.  Well, look, you know, he does care about Philly, you know, because I do go down there a lot. 
[00:43:00]  And all of a sudden, he does his break and then continues talking to me.  And I'm just like, I'm not going to go, dude, I want to go on the air with you.  It's obvious I'm in the studio.  Just throw me on the air for a few minutes with you.  And all of a sudden, I awkwardly, like, leave the studio with my, quote, posse.  I'm like, well, maybe we'll try in a few more minutes.  And then I go downstairs and get, like, a tour of the TV station that they're part of. 
[00:43:30]  And then it starts that dumb downpour that we started the show with, right?  So then I go back upstairs, and I'm outside the studio.  Eye contact.  He's on a microphone.  He can see right through the door.  I'm sitting there waiting out the rain with everybody.  Now I have nothing else to do.  I did what I wanted to do there.  Now I'm just sitting and waiting to go.  He doesn't put me on the air.  Why?  I don't know.  I would have done a whole shift.  I would have just hung out for two hours playing, you know, rock music and getting stupid.  And then I was going to call you. 
[00:44:00]  I was going to call Jimmy.  I was going to make it a whole dumb thing.  I'm here in Philly.  Let me see if my friends are up and around and see if I can get them on the air.  But he couldn't figure it out, I guess.  Do you think he knew you wanted to go on?  Let me just play devil's advocate, and you were there.  I wasn't.  Is it possible he saw you and figured, nah, I wouldn't want to come on?  If you're a radio guy, and you're doing a show, and someone comes in that obviously does radio as well,  it's not, it's second nature.  You just turn the mic on and go, hey, man, what's up?  In Philly?  Want to say hi?  And then at that point, yeah, what's up? 
[00:44:30]  And then maybe turn off their mic.  That's it.  But I want to do something.  And I'm like, I can't believe he's not asking me to go on the air with him.  This is really strange.  You know, I was going to even tell him, look, I'll do the rest of your shift.  I don't care.  Just show me which buttons to push.  Go home.  Go home.  We're going to send him home.  Yeah, go home.  I hope he was pretty much, he was going to fire you and take over your shift.  Wouldn't it be funny if you did a shift, you had so much fun, you just refused to come back?  And be like, all right, the joke's over.  I love this shift only. 
[00:45:00]  This is fun.  So I just want to say to Philly, I was ready to do, I don't know, at least a couple long breaks with Cousin Ed Friday night.  I was going to possibly even just do an hour and tell him to go home, but it was in the cards, I guess.  I thought it would have been cool.  And I'm not saying now you're going to get the phone call.  Opie, you come down, we're going to plan a whole day where Opie does a shift and this, that.  And it's not going to be the spontaneous thing.  And clear this up.  When you say tell him to go home, you don't mean that like, get out of here, I'm here.  But you mean like, hey, this is fun. 
[00:45:30]  I'll do it.  Yeah, I was going to just, I was going to like do a break or two and then see where it went.  And I didn't have anything to do really.  I was thinking maybe I'll just, you know, call the right people down there and just do an hour or two on the radio for them.  And I want to make it perfectly clear.  I don't have any problem with Cousin Ed.  I don't think he has a problem with us, but it was just weird that he wouldn't just like go with it.  He seems like a cool dude that goes with things, right?  So I just want to acknowledge that I really did want to do some radio just locally in Philly.  And I got pretty much shut out. 
[00:46:00]  Were you leaning over toward a microphone, kind of opening your mouth?  Anthony, it couldn't have been more obvious.  It couldn't have been more obvious.  I just want to talk.  But you don't want to be the guy that says, hey, can I go on with you?  It just should have been understood.  If you're in radio, it's just understood.  Like you're in studio, you're supposed to go, hey, you want to do a few minutes?  Yeah, that would be cool.  Say hi.  I look like a big shot, wish A.J. a happy graduation.  He would look like a hero in front of his friends and stuff.  Wait, did you say to them, I'm going to try to go on the air? 
[00:46:30]  Did you say to them?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, I look like a complete dude.  Now you look like the dick.  Oh, yeah.  Then I had to kind of walk downstairs like, well, I guess, why don't we go to MMR?  Maybe they'll put me on.  How did you say?  What did you say?  Like, yeah, I'm going to go up there.  I'm sure they'll probably put me right on.  Yeah, I was like, of course, of course.  Yeah, yeah, we'll get on.  I don't even want to look at it.  And then I actually had to say, well, I guess he can't break into mandatory Metallica. 
[00:47:00]  It's a big feature.  Yeah, that must be it.  It's a big feature for these rock stations.  Oh, did you look bad?  Oh, yeah.  Because they're starting to look at me.  I'm like, well, look, that's the second Metallica song.  I don't know.  Maybe after mandatory Metallica.  Your head is sweating.  You're like, oh.  Because mandatory Metallica is so much more important than having one of the members from  this show on.  Of course it is.  Stupid mandatory Metallica.  Yeah, funny.  I don't think he's going to go on.  Because they're all standing there like, oh, he's just going to walk in and go right on. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  They're like, this is going to be cool.  We've never been up here before.  This is our local station.  It's their local.  It's really huge for them.  You're like, come on, follow me.  I'll just call a guy.  Yeah.  I'll walk on.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why I gave me a hero's welcome.  Exactly.  So then I'm just like, oh, you want some wow stickers?  I saw a pile of wow stickers.  I'm trying to make it still look good.  Like, yeah, like, hey, man, you guys want some letterhead?  Hey, why don't I get a picture in front of the YSP banner?  Like, I was doing all that stuff to make it almost worthwhile.  Was it worthwhile?  And I wrote a note for Karen Buck outside her office. 
[00:48:00]  You know, Cousin Ed, come on, wake up.  Hey, Ed, could I get a picture in front of a mic like I'm talking with the headphones on?  Yeah, exactly.  And the actual mic potted up?  Exactly.  Even Lindsay said, because you guys told me this at the cellar, she's like, it was  so awkward.  You're all just standing there.  You're there with your chick and her brother.  You want to just go on and say hello to the city?  There are times in your life you really think you're a big shot and then realize you're  just not.  You're just not a big shot. 
[00:48:30]  Somebody, you know, brings you down to size.  He knocked you, took you down a couple of pegs.  I think Ope was too big for his britches.  What a harsh language.  And we love Philly.  I thought it would have been a really cool little thing like, oh my God, look who stopped  by.  And then, you know, play a few songs I like and, you know, screw around a little bit.  Yes, Kenny?  Don't feel bad because I want you to know the reservation I made at the restaurant Friday  night.  Yeah.  The only reason you got that reservation is because of your celebrity status. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, well.  Was it Popeye's?  Something I'd never pull out that card, but it had to be a big Friday night for everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a special night for a special person with special people.  The retarded.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  We got to take another break.  We'll get into some real things.  Oh, it's the 25th anniversary of AIDS.  Happy birthday to you. 
[00:49:30]  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear AIDS.  Happy birthday to you.  And of course.  And many more.  How old are you?  How old aren't you?  Oh, 25 years young. 
[00:50:00]  AIDS.  Are you one, T-cell?  Are you two, T-cell?  Are you three, T-cell?  Going on.  Are you one?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday.  AIDS.  Happy birthday.  Blow out the candle.  A little wispy breath.  Happy birthday to you. 
[00:50:30]  Happy birthday to you.  Trying to blow out the candles.  You can only blow out one at a time.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  24 to go.  Just.  23 to go. 
[00:51:00]  Let my life mate's tears put the candles out.  Well, AIDS used to mean something else, right?  We got the old AIDS commercial.  Yeah.  AIDS is a diet to something.  AIDS used to make you lose weight quickly.  Oh, wait a minute.  AIDS used to be a diet supplement.  But the only difference is that the AIDS diet pill was supposed to be taken orally.  Yes.  It was chocolate that you put in your mouth.  There was so much there, and I completely ran out of steam with it. 
[00:51:30]  There were so many thoughts.  Oh, I know.  I just petered out and said it factually.  What a wet list.  Nothing.  All right.  So, AIDS used to mean something else.  Here's the old commercial.  This is a real commercial.  Every time we play it, people are like, wow, that's really funny that you guys made that up.  No, this is real.  They used to play this back in the early 80s and 70s.  70s.  A-Y-D-S.  A-Y-D-S.  So, here's a commercial for AIDS.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6. 
[00:52:00]  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight.  Yet, AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  And there you have it.  Enjoy AIDS.  Isn't that amazing?  A-Y-D-S.  Yeah.  By the way, our own Danny, he bid on AIDS. 
[00:52:30]  He bid on AIDS.  He got it.  He got the AIDS?  He got AIDS for $11.  $11 and he got the AIDS.  I don't know where he is.  He might be over at XM, but he bid on AIDS and he got it for $11.  So, there you go.  That seems a little, ugh.  Is it an actual box full of the AIDS?  I mean, yeah, I could, because they stopped making that years ago.  I'm sure it's rotting or petrified.  Probably been sitting in the can.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  I think it's just been sitting in the can for a while.  Absolutely.  AIDS comes in a box, not in a can.  No, it could come in a can.  I know that.  Absolutely.  I don't think that was that.  There's 19 AIDS in a box.  19 AIDS.  He's got the AIDS in a box.  But they melt, too.  You got to be careful because then you'll have AIDS all over your face.  You don't want to wipe your mouth.  Absolutely.  You don't want to let people know that you've got the AIDS and you're using it.  They'll know soon enough when you start losing weight. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  More about the anniversary of AIDS and other things on the way.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus has spread once again today.  Well, it spreads every day, but every once in a while it gets to spread to an entire city.  And today we say hi to Detroit, Columbus, and Rochester.  Being heard on The Zone in Rochester, The Big Wazoo in Columbus, Ohio, and WXYG AM 1270 in Detroit. 
[00:54:00]  Detroit.  See, I had to get that broadcasting voice on for the AM station.  They like that.  If you listen to AM, you want to hear a really good voice.  You got to hear the WXYG AM 1270.  What are you laughing at?  Oh, before we get into that really fast, the couple stabbed. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Because this is a story right down Anthony's alley there.  Oh, this is typical stupid New Yorkers.  You jackasses.  I don't understand why people continue to do this.  People call me paranoid all the time because I'm paranoid.  No, because I live like...  No, you are paranoid, but as far as this stuff goes, I'm right with you.  Jimmy's right with you.  I am.  You're not right with me.  You should be.  I'm not right with you when it comes down to staying up all hours of the night in your Nazi uniform. 
[00:55:00]  I don't wear a Nazi uniform.  Oh, yeah, you only wear half of it, the top half.  I don't even own a piece of one.  With tighty-whities.  Don't even own a piece of a Nazi uniform.  Updating your Nazi MySpace...  Don't have a Nazi MySpace.  My MySpace.  MySpace.com slash Anthony Cumia.  C-U-M-I-A.  Anthony C-U-M-I-A.  All one word.  Shut up with your banana mouth.  Don't step on my MySpace plug.  I don't know.  I don't plug mine.  Look at him.  No, don't plug it out because then people get confused. 
[00:55:30]  I'm telling you.  One thought at a time.  Don't go to Jim Norton.  It's to Anthony Cumia.  Yeah.  So now you just messed up his plug.  That's why he'll constantly have more people.  You learn in broadcasting school one thought per break or one plug per break because they  say in broadcasting school that the people that listen to you are dummies.  So if you're listening to this show, according to the broadcasting schools out there and the  colleges, you're a dummy.  You can only digest one thought at a time.  Listen.  Listen to your local radio.  You'll hear every DJ do one thought per break. 
[00:56:00]  One thought and then back to the music.  They don't even want you doing weather and sports because they think people are going  to get confused.  It's like a regular conversation.  It kind of goes off in places.  But this is what they teach you in college and stuff.  And I'm sitting in these classrooms going, ugh, just give me a mic.  I'll figure it out.  You know who else is our listeners are dummies?  Everyone else in society.  Right.  Anyway.  Thank you for bringing that up.  What's this?  Sir?  What's the, uh...  Let me get away with it. 
[00:56:30]  Apparently some elderly couple.  Not really elderly these days.  I don't know.  I don't even know what old is anymore.  There's people in the...  All right.  No, I'm going to say elderly.  They're in their late 60s.  You're elderly.  I don't even know what old is.  Nah.  You're elderly.  You're old.  You're not.  That's elderly.  Late 60s is not old anymore.  But it's elderly.  Late 60s is the new 40.  No.  I don't know how they say that.  40 is the new 30.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Quiet.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Who said that?  I guarantee it wasn't a 20-year-old.  Right.  They actually say that.  40 is the new 30.  No, it's not.  Isn't it great watching commercials for, like, diapers or denture cream or some drug for arthritic, friggin' bone-breaking, brittle, goddamn graham cracker hips disease?  And the old woman will always say something like, I'm 65, and I'm having the best years of my life.  Are you wetting yourself that you need diapers for this commercial? 
[00:57:30]  Are you trying to convince me you're having more fun now than you were at 20, 25?  Banging the boys coming home on the troop ships.  A dough boy comes home, and you nail them.  That's more fun than shoving fake teeth in your head and strapping on some Velcro diaper.  Be honest, at least.  Look, I'm old. 
[00:58:00]  I wet myself.  That's why I wear these.  It was much better when I was 20.  Or these are the best years of my life, but I just got out of the gulag.  I was there for 48 years.  At least then she's got an excuse.  I'm in my golden years, and I'm having more fun than ever.  Are you?  They're called your golden years because the color of the inside of your thighs becomes.  You incontinent old idiots.  As she's opening up the little M to make sure she took her pills for the day. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  It's so convenient.  It's one pill a month, and it takes care of my menopause.  Oh, great.  Yeah, that's something you thought of at 25.  I can't wait till I'm going through menopause.  I can't wait till my ovaries dry up.  That's what that old bat is thinking on that commercial.  Their ovaries dry up and fall off the tree and roll out of you.  Be honest.  Don't try to make it sound funny.  The old arthritic bitch on the beach painting. 
[00:59:00]  This is wonderful.  Her knuckles look like sausages that have just been mangled in a machine, and she's painting with them.  Yeah, that's it.  That's better than 25.  Be honest.  They just added another rainy day to the chart.  What happened?  A half hour ago was just Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  Now it's Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  Saturday, Sunday.  Get the car, you exploding bitch.  With the dumb weather guy that cannot improvise.  Is that him? 
[00:59:30]  Oh, he's the worst.  We'll get into him another day.  Where the hell were we?  The old couple on the west side.  Dopes.  Elderly couple.  These stories are in the paper.  It seems like every other day now.  Once a week.  Something.  Why do people have trust or faith in their fellow man?  As you know, I go home.  I lock my doors.  I have an alarm system second to none.  I'm talking motion detectors.  I'm talking.  I'm setting alarms.  I leave like the bathroom window on the second floor open for some breeze to come through. 
[01:00:00]  But no one's going on.  You need a goddamn extension ladder popped up against there.  By that time, the motion detectors got you, and I'm firing out my window.  So, I have no worry about that.  But you've got to bypass it on your keypad.  Bypass the window.  So, I'm just a nut job in my house, locking, batting it down the hatchet.  Just to jump in really fast.  So, I'm watching CBS this morning, yesterday morning, whatever.  And they're bragging.  They do a whole piece on this town.  And I wish I knew where the town was so I could give all the criminals the heads up.  A town where no one locks their doors in America. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, that's wonderful.  This story.  They do these stories every once in a while on TV, right?  It's a town in America.  They don't lock their doors.  And the reporter, he did the old Michael Moore thing from Michael Moore's film.  Yep.  All of a sudden, started walking in front doors and asking for lemonade.  And instead of them being surprised and scared, they're like, oh, sure.  Come on in.  And giving them lemonade and stuff.  Where the hell is this?  Although I don't think they were too worried because they probably saw the camera crew walk in with the guy.  Yeah, that might help.  And knew that it was probably relatively safe. 
[01:01:00]  But basically, they don't lock their doors in this town.  The police guy is completely bored.  The police guy?  The police guy.  Barney Fife?  Absolutely.  And then all the people that own stores and stuff, they leave their merchandise out overnight with a little box that says, you know, please, you know, pay me here.  The honor system.  The honor system.  What white town is this?  And then there's a candy store where everyone is so honest in this town that they leave for lunch. 
[01:01:30]  And instead of, you know, I'll be back in an hour eating lunch or what have you, be back in 15 minutes.  No, they just leave their store and they have the honor system where, you know, you buy some candy.  You just, you know, put your money in the little tin.  How do you get there?  A DeLorean at 88 miles per hour?  Right.  Here's what you ought to do.  You ought to do that same test with the lemonade.  Hey, but instead of sitting in a camera crew, you send in a Dominican with stockings over his face.  Yeah.  Let's see how they go.  Welcome.  Have some lemonade.  And the wacky radio bit is to try to do that in New York City.  But I guarantee one of our guys would have to die. 
[01:02:00]  They'd just get shot or something.  Yeah, they would get a shotgun blast in their chest here in New York City if you try that same gag.  Unless, of course, you go to this elderly couple's house.  All right.  Yeah.  So getting back to that.  What a dope.  They live, I guess, on the 90s.  I'm sorry.  Just because I want.  Sammy in Queens.  Go ahead.  Sammy.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  Oh, that town is Lakeside, Ohio.  That was the one they featured yesterday?  Yeah.  Because that guy, Steve Hartman, does that piece every year.  Lakeside, Ohio.  With the bikes that you've been stolen, and you go buy candy and get your change. 
[01:02:30]  It's ridiculous.  Well, then, I'm thinking, thanks for blowing up this town spot, by the way.  Yeah, now you can go there.  You go on national TV telling everyone that these people don't lock their doors.  And that's what I was thinking yesterday.  See, if I was a criminal, I'm like, well, what?  Does JetBlue fly to Ohio?  I'm there.  I'm there tomorrow.  I'm going to have a great weekend.  That was so funny.  But just the guy walking in the house, oh, you want some lemonade or iced tea?  Yeah, yeah.  Where does that happen?  Hey, this is great iced tea. 
[01:03:00]  To the people of Lakeside, Ohio, get your locks now.  That's right.  You're on national TV as a.  Lock them up.  The news blew it for you.  Yeah, as the dopiest town in America.  Why wouldn't you want to lock your doors?  Lock your doors.  There's someone driving through town who is an artist, you idiots.  Lock your goddamn doors.  Lock.  Get your alarms, your cameras, and your weapons.  We're at war, my God.  We love, we trust each other.  You don't.  You know, if I have to live in a society where we have to lock our doors, is that really living? 
[01:03:30]  All right, you old broad.  Say that when some hulking mass of animal is on top of you breathing whiskey breath on your face.  And that's the type of.  And you're trying to identify them.  That's the type of town in cold blood happens in.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Your whole family is just shotgun because you're just idealistic retards.  Yeah.  It never happens in our town.  But when it does, yuck.  It's confusing.  Yeah, it's always the sheriff.  This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:04:00]  I've never seen.  We've never seen.  In the 30 years I've been on the job, we've never seen anything like this.  Yeah.  We had a guy stole a pack of gum one time.  I never saw brains in a chandelier before.  That was about it.  Right.  This town has never experienced crime at all.  But the first one was a Lulu.  Was it?  37 massacred in eight different houses.  Heads in the windows with candles on top of their skulls.  Like it's not just a murder or a robbery. 
[01:04:30]  It's some sick twisted thing.  Yeah.  That's it.  Just, oh.  Eight homes with pentagrams on the wall.  Pulling their tongues through their slit throats.  Columbian necktie.  Bunch of sodomy victims.  Lovely.  Any town USA.  Take that, you idiots.  And just when they thought it was over, they went to the girls' dormitory.  Oh, no.  Not the girls' dormitory.  Here it is.  You're not going to believe what they found in the bathtub.  Yes.  Oh, great.  They had been cut out of every girl and stacked in a neat pile in the bathroom. 
[01:05:00]  Ugh.  Inoculated arms.  A pile of inoculated arms.  I was thinking of something else I couldn't quite mention.  Pull out like an apple corer.  Anyway.  It's always the worst when they finally get hit in those towns where they don't lock the doors.  Lock your doors, idiots.  Lock your dumb doors.  We live in a new age.  Leave it to beaver.  Well, we got Phil.  He lives in Lakeside, Ohio. 
[01:05:30]  Phil.  Phil.  How's it going?  Hi, Phil.  Oh, yeah.  I live in Lakeside, Ohio.  Is your door locked, idiot?  I keep my door locked.  Good boy.  But most of them don't.  You don't.  Yeah?  There's a teacher of mine.  And she has, of course, the doors unlocked.  And some crazy persons walk around naked.  I guess they found this person naked in her house.  So the one police dude that was there had to just, you know, do his thing. 
[01:06:00]  But, yeah, that's the Lakeside.  I now understand.  They don't lock their doors because they figure that the other residents are too stupid to steal.  They have a weapon.  It's called boredom.  Yeah, exactly.  The crook comes in and he lulls him to sleep with his stimulating conversation.  It starts with give me all your money.  It ends with a nap.  It's a hotel for everybody.  Cops show up.  There's a guy who's, like, just standing there asleep with a television on his shoulder.  There he is, officer.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break because Frank Vincent's calling any moment. 
[01:06:30]  And then you've got to tell the West Side story.  And then Jimmy's got to.  West Side story.  It's the Sharks and the Jets.  And da-dee-dee-dee.  Oh, does that stink?  When you're a, oh, the other one.  And then we'll get into what Jimmy was laughing about.  You thought that was great, right?  It's the greatest thing I've read.  Goddamn rich.  Why are you guys beeping things?  Beeping things.  Why the are you guys beeping that we get to hear every day on? 
[01:07:00]  Because I beep whatever I want.  I can talk over the beep.  See?  He's making it.  See?  He makes it into a bit.  It's a bit, you stupid.  All right, listen.  25th anniversary of AIDS.  Hey, how about that?  You get that from guys in the.  So I hear, also from drugs, but usually from guys in the.  Or you could eat a monkey, too.  Oh, eat them.  Yeah, why don't you eat them?  Before play. 
[01:07:30]  What are you talking about, Opie?  Actually, you could get it from eating the monkey.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought it was just from doing horrid things to monkey.  You could also get it from eating the monkey.  Yes.  Like monkey meat?  Yeah.  Uncooked, like salmonella?  I don't know.  Maybe that's their sushi over there.  You're going to cook the AIDS out there.  That's African sushi.  Wrapped in monkey fur.  African sushi.  There's something there.  All right, listen.  The anniversary of AIDS.  So an honor.  A little sing-along. 
[01:08:00]  I was overweight and embarrassed to go.  That's the wrong button, Opie.  Oh, boy.  I was overweight.  Looks like the CD player has the AIDS.  It's not working right.  Give it a robe and some broth.  Here's a sing-along.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex, but you hear.  It isn't clear.  But what we're certain of is you have AIDS. 
[01:08:30]  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  It's not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  But it's AIDS.  But it's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS. 
[01:09:00]  Off the instant feedback, by the way.  Eating monkey meat was how doctors think AIDS first came to humans.  Opie gets a point.  Oh.  See, I'm not that stupid all the time.  Is this the peppers or the, um...  Yeah, but he doesn't mean that the way you meant it. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, yeah?  What happened?  Because this is also...  She grew up in a Indiana town at a good-looking mama.  Oh, Mary Jane's last dance?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's the controversy that...  A little controversy.  A little controversy.  Red Hot Chili Peppers ripped off Tom Petty.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out today.  On the phone, our pal, our buddy, Frank Vincent, everyone.  Frank.  Hey.  How you doing, Frank?  How are you guys?  What's going on, Frank?  Opie and Anthony right here. 
[01:10:00]  You feeling better?  Well, I'm going to be all right, I think.  Yeah?  I took us some medication, and I'm feeling better.  I hope so.  So, you know, it didn't feel too good for me to see you laid up like that.  Well, what do you think is going to happen?  What do you think is going to happen?  Frank, I hope something.  For God's sake.  Look, Frank, I'm a huge supporter.  I love The Sopranos.  I love The Sopranos.  I have not missed an episode since it first aired. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  And every season finale, I want to go up and smack someone with the last name of Chase  right in his head.  I was waiting for something.  I understand how the show is what it is and stuff, and a lot of the family thing, they  got to get that involved in there.  I was waiting, as was a lot of other people, for some type of big cliffhanger.  Well, I think the cliffhanger is Phil and Tony. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was, I don't know.  I mean, Tony made it, he saw the light or something.  That was a great scene, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, that was a great dramatic scene and everything, but I kind of, with a season  finale like that, when you've got to wait, this goddamn show of yours there, Frank, you  got to wait another year.  We got to wait until another year.  I know what's going to happen, by the way.  Eight months.  Yeah, Phil comes out of the coma, I've seen the script, and he has a change of heart, 
[01:11:30]  and he begins donating to the Rainbow Coalition.  Somehow I don't see that happening.  I think you're getting fresh.  I don't know.  Listen, you know, we act it, they write it, so that's what we have to do.  I hear you.  That's why, you know, I hold no ill will toward you, my friend, Frank Vincent.  No, I know that.  The scene, the early scene with me and Tony, when I told him, you know.  That was good.  I liked that at the little meeting that wasn't a sit-down.  Vito was impacted, you know.  That was, his impact, yeah.  Yeah, his rear was impacted. 
[01:12:00]  I like when you told your wife, stop breaking my balls about clams.  That's my favorite one of the episodes.  How about my new honey, though?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Taking her out of the car, and you almost got blown up.  Yep, yep.  That was good.  See, now when it opened like that, I'm thinking, all right.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Do you get to bang her in real life?  No, she's a married girl.  Lovely, lovely girl.  She's married to a comedian.  She's married to a famous comedian.  I don't know his name.  Jim Norton? 
[01:12:30]  No.  He works around town.  I don't know.  Really?  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  Find out, find out.  She was quite a dish, if I may say.  Polish girl.  Oh, yeah?  Is she also the maid, or no?  Yes, yes.  Oh, it is her.  Okay.  Yeah, she's very lovely.  Of course.  You keep it right in close.  You know, you keep all that stuff together.  Of course.  The wife goes out, and there she is.  I like how you're a class act, too.  He gets around the other side of the car.  He takes her out.  Right.  He's giving her a little sweet talk, and then a little dirty talk.  Right.  And then the place blows up.  I think so.  Ruins your night. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, it was great watching Phil try to be charming.  Like, it was like, you're holding her arm, and you're just like this lecherous guy.  And what did he say?  A psychopath?  Yeah.  It was something he said about, something should come between us.  Yeah, we got to straighten out something between the two of us.  I have to get something straight between us.  Yeah, it's just the worst flirt line ever, and he's like, smoothly delivering it.  It was really good.  Right, right.  Next thing you know, they're lying on their backs because of a bomb.  Really just started off good.  So, anyway, you know anything about, I know you can never tell, but.  Don't even know when we're starting. 
[01:13:30]  Don't even know anything.  Yeah.  How many episodes?  Eight.  Eight more they're doing.  Eight to go.  He's got a lot to atone for, doesn't he?  He certainly does.  I mean, we've watched every season, and there's been some loose ends.  Every season.  Yeah, every season.  And then, you know, I want them all tied up.  I want to know where the hell the Russian guy was running through the goddamn woods.  I want that tied up.  You want to know where Adriana is?  You want to know where she is?  Adriana, dead. 
[01:14:00]  She's dead.  Although I always think that they didn't show him actually shooting her,  and I always think that they left it open in case they wanted to.  They probably wouldn't need to be too cheesy.  He's a good soldier, that guy.  Yeah, he wouldn't.  Carmela's having, you know, she's having thoughts about that.  She wants to know.  Yeah, that's why Tony gave her something to do.  Gave her a project.  Yeah, give her something to do.  But the way they, a lot of times they don't tie up loose ends,  so like the next eight episodes she'll probably call the detective,  and they'll go, we got nothing.  And she'll go, oh. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  Wait, I wanted to know what.  At least there's no loose ends with Vito.  No, no.  It was a full end.  Yeah, it was played rather nicely.  It was a finale.  Yeah, see, that should have been a finale right there.  It could have been, yeah.  You were so good this season.  I mean, I thought the season was in and out.  Like, I liked it, but everything you did was great in it.  I'm not just saying that because you were on the phone.  Yeah, I liked the expanded role he had and everything.  Absolutely.  So I think that Phil's going to become a little more prominent in the next eight. 
[01:15:00]  I mean, it makes sense to me.  I don't know.  You're kind of calling the shots now for the New York side.  Yeah, more or less.  Johnny's in jail.  He's folding laundry.  Do you think it's like they just, when they do something like that, is it because they  kind of like when they, do they run out of storyline for Johnny and they're like, and  you're obviously doing really well.  So they're like, well, how can we push him aside and bring somebody else in?  Well, you know, you got to think about this is seven years, seven years, 13 shows a year.  It's an hour a show, more or less.  You know, you're talking about, you know, you couldn't make this many movies in that 
[01:15:30]  many time.  And that much time, you know.  Yeah, it is like a lot of different storylines.  Like, I know they got to get into the women, they have to get like Carmela's kind of thing  going and, you know, and, and, uh.  Keeps the broads watching, right, Frank?  Yeah.  Well, AJ's happy now.  He's got a little girl.  AJ had a pretty graphic sex scene there last night.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, Margulies was great, wasn't she?  Yeah.  She's really sexy.  The one who's having sex with, uh, with, uh, Chris?  Yeah, Julianne Margulies.  Yeah, you liked, uh, Jimmy must have liked the scene, uh, at the couch when she's in 
[01:16:00]  her little, uh.  Boy shorts.  Boy shorts in the top and, yeah.  Yeah, they spark up, like, either a crack pipe and then she goes to, like, you know,  she goes and undoes his belt.  I'm like, what an evening.  Crack it.  I'm in recovery, but I'd probably relapse if I knew she'd drop down and take my belt  off.  Like, ah, one day.  Who's looking?  Who's looking?  Why not?  Yeah, I was really, I was really happy to see your, uh, you're, uh, you're such a great  last, uh, please tell me at least you murdered that awful foreign doctor who misdiagnosed 
[01:16:30]  you when it finally comes back.  Yeah, that guy needs a bullet in the head.  He needs a good, he needs a good batting.  I call him an arrogant bastard or something, isn't I?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was really, it was, uh, great though, man.  Are you doing any films?  Um, I got two lined up.  Put it in and see what happens.  Yeah.  You're, uh, you're still promoting a guy's guide to being a man's man, Frank.  Absolutely.  My book on amazon.com, my guy's guide to being a man's man.  Yep.  Uh, we're doing, uh, t-shirts on, uh, frankvincent.com, Billy Basker, go home and get your t-shirt,  go home and get your shine box. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  With t-shirts, right on.  And I want, I want, uh, uh, uh, he's getting fresh.  You gotta put that on a shirt, please.  What is it?  Uh, I'm breaking your balls and right away you're getting fresh.  That's gotta be on a shirt.  I'm looking for, I'm looking for a, uh, fill line.  How about stop breaking my balls about clams?  That was fantastic.  He said it to his wife.  Or I was gonna put jersey?  Come on.  That's a good one.  That's not a bad one.  Yeah.  All right, Frank, uh, looking forward to seeing, uh, seeing you on The Sopranos in, uh, 2010. 
[01:17:30]  Well, when I come back home, guys, I'm still in Florida.  When I come back home, I'll come and visit you.  Yeah, that'd be great.  See you again, man.  We'd love to have you, Frank.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Take care, buddy.  Okay.  Good friend of the show, Frank Vincent, everyone.  In Florida, huh?  Yeah.  That's where he gets that tan.  Inbred from Pennsylvania.  What's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Uh, I wanted to welcome all of our new listeners in Detroit with a little shootout.  Oh, that's right.  We wanted, uh, to do shootouts today. 
[01:18:00]  Yep.  We only have an hour left in this half, uh, of the Opie and Anthony show.  So, yes, we're being heard on WXYT AM 1270 in Detroit, and we thought it would be, uh,  appropriate to have shootouts today.  Not a lot of people do the shoutouts.  Ugh.  We, uh, we prefer, especially for Detroit, a shootout.  Right.  What do you got there, Inbred?  Uh, I got a couple of, uh, let's see, I got a little .38 special revolver, uh, .40 caliber  automatic.  All right.  That might work. 
[01:18:30]  I got a couple of, I got a couple of shotguns and a great big old rifle.  All right.  What's the big old rifle?  It's a .300 mag.  All right.  That's what we got to hear.  Okay.  You want that?  Yeah.  Crank that thing up.  All right.  Hang on.  I'm running.  What are you shooting at?  Uh, I'm shooting at a target out here at the range.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  That's good.  Probably a guy who couldn't get the ring out of his tub.  Ah, shooting at a target's boring.  I pothin' you.  I want him to shoot it straight up in the air.  Yeah, I want you to come down. 
[01:19:00]  All right, guys.  I'm going to set the phone down.  Are you ready?  All right.  Here we go.  That's safety.  Go ahead.  Shootouts for Detroit today.  Shootouts for Detroit.  Shootouts for Detroit.  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Welcome, Detroit.  Welcome.  That's for you, Detroit.  How's that?  We might even do better before the end of this.  Bravo.  The only thing that could have made me happier is if after the shots were fired, a woman was 
[01:19:30]  screaming, please no, I'm sorry dinner was cold.  Or just hear a thud as his body falls off.  That sack of potatoes sound.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Getting to the floor.  Yeah, exactly.  Hello.  Hello.  Brain matter off the wall.  Hello.  Hello.  All right, Inbred.  You rock.  Thanks, guys.  Bye, Dolphix.  All right.  The shootouts have begun for Detroit.  Getting back into the story, Anthony, that we started with.  This couple on the west side here in New York City. 
[01:20:00]  Dopes.  And this happens from time to time.  It's a setup.  We don't understand why people do this.  Could you set it up, actually, with the old asking for directions thing?  It's one of my favorite things.  Oh, that's what happens here in New York also.  You've got to learn, I don't know, a lot of tourists get taken, a lot of stupid Good  Samaritan.  Nothing worse than a Good Samaritan.  Whenever I hear that a Good Samaritan's been injured, I blame the Good Samaritan, not the  animal that's doing the injuring. 
[01:20:30]  They walk down the street, and here's what will happen.  It's happened to me while I've walked to the studio.  And you get some guy come up to you and go, excuse me, which way is north?  And you go, well, and then you turn around and kind of go, I believe it's this, and then  wham!  Like the last thing you remember is, which way is north?  Boom!  And then you'll hear, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, 
[01:21:00]  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  as your eyes slowly wake up and your family's around you.  And you're like, it was June.  It was June.  Why is there Christmas music playing?  Why am I looking at a Christmas tree?  There's a Christmas tree, and there's like garland hanging up and cards.  And where did all these tubes come from?  I'm in hospital, and there's tubes and Christmas cards, and I see Thanksgiving cards and Halloween  cards and all kinds of flowers.  I remember giving directions to someone. 
[01:21:30]  What happened?  The guy cold cocked you.  You went down.  You were robbed, and you woke up months later.  Good Samaritan.  And what happens to me?  If I walk down the street and anyone asks me anything, excuse me, what time is it?  I go, time, I gotta know to the thing there, which you don't think, early.  You just gotta act crazy.  You gotta act crazy and yell and walk in the middle of the street like a lunatic. 
[01:22:00]  That's the only way you survive in this town.  People walk around and randomly get hit over the head with cobblestones.  Time!  There's no time.  Time.  Time.  Time.  It's all relative if you think about a paradox of going and this.  But before you know it, he's off to somebody else just asking, you know, which way is north.  Right.  But, uh...  You know how I handle it when they say what time it is?  I can't stop.  I've got pockets full of cash.  I'm off to the bank with lots of dough. 
[01:22:30]  I have to make a deposit.  Yeah, that'll work.  These, uh, good Samaritans, elderly couple, in their apartment, they hear a knock on the  door.  A little foley work there for you people.  That was good.  They hear a knock on the door and, uh, a guy is there and goes, excuse me, do you have  a pen?  I need to borrow a pen.  And they opened the door to get this gentleman a pen. 
[01:23:00]  And were rewarded by being stabbed.  The guy busts in, stabs the guy, uh, the woman, then to keep him from stabbing the husband  anymore, runs and gets 300 bucks, gives him the $300.  She is promptly rewarded by a stabbing of her own, uh, by this gentleman who then flees  the, uh, apartment. 
[01:23:30]  Exactly.  That's horrific.  That's horrific.  What year do you think it is?  Where do you think you live?  Can I borrow a pen?  That's the worst line I've ever heard.  A pen?  What the hell do you...  No!  No!  How did you get in here, this building?  There's supposedly a doorman and a buzzer system.  Um, but you know what people do?  And this works all the time.  Worked in my building when I used to live in an apartment building. 
[01:24:00]  Ugh.  Insecured places.  Ugh.  Hate them.  They, uh, they would hit every button.  They would just...  And somebody just goes up and hits the buzzer and buzzes people in.  Why?  Doesn't ask, doesn't...  Because they don't want to hear the buzzer going off.  If you go to the buzzer, bam, bam, bam, most people are going to go, hello, who is it?  But someone will just...  I was waiting for a delivery.  This must be him.  And they come up and go, you got a pen. 
[01:24:30]  The animal is in your building.  And he's in your building.  And sometimes they come to a door.  Sometimes they'll wait in the elevator or by the elevator.  Sometimes in that stairwell.  Nothing worse than when the elevator didn't work in the building.  You open that...  The big heavy door makes that sound.  And then, God forbid, you see someone up in one of the landings.  Now what do you do?  You got to kill him.  Because he's probably there to kill you.  By the way, Bill and Waterford on the instant feedback. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, Bill.  The couple wasn't stabbed, Anthony.  Yes, they were.  He just used their blood as ink.  Oh, is that it?  Because they didn't have a pen.  All right, I'm sorry.  My mistake.  How about opening it with the chain on it and slipping the guy a bick?  That chain doesn't work, by the way.  No.  That chain is such an old person security thing.  It's fake security.  Because once you open that up, a big foot kicking at the door, that chain is gone.  No problem.  Gone.  That is easy.  The thing on my door is the piece of metal. 
[01:25:30]  There's an interlocking piece of metal where if you open it, it will only go so far.  Like in the hotel rooms.  Yeah.  Yeah, those are pretty good.  Those are strong.  But only as strong as its weakest link, if I may make that up right now.  I just made that up.  And I did.  If it's just screwed into the molding with little wood screws, that could be kicked out too.  You need something heavy duty.  I have security in my building.  Bolting the security.  You're basing your life on some other guy that is being paid crap wages to protect people he doesn't care about. 
[01:26:00]  You know what?  Someone comes to my door.  You know what I hear?  My phone rings.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr from my doorbell.  And I answer the phone and I go,  Who is it?  Delivery.  Delivery from what?  From who?  Uh, FedEx.  All right.  Let me look out the window and see if there's a FedEx truck out there and then I'll be down.  If I don't see one, um, I got a patio that overlooks the front door and I will be taking up a firing position from there. 
[01:26:30]  Mr. FedEx guy.  That's what I do.  Way to handle it.  And then cameras.  You gotta be secure in this day and age.  There's people out there who want nothing more than your stuff, your life, and sometimes worse.  When I'm in my building, when a food delivery comes up, they have a security guy with the food delivery guy.  They go everywhere.  No one goes through the building alone.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  The concierge guy will, like, make sure they check you up, check you out. 
[01:27:00]  And then if it's a food, if it's a guest, they'll call up and then they'll send the person up.  And they have a, they have a bunch of guys down there that work there full time.  And then the security also.  What would you do if someday I just ended up at your door?  No security, nothing.  It's happened.  I'd say.  Oh, it's happened.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm saying that sometimes somebody will walk through the building that people don't catch.  See?  I would say of the multiple guests I've had.  All right.  And they're not family members.  Oh, they are.  I would say two. 
[01:27:30]  It's amazing they're good.  They stop everyone.  They stopped me one time.  I had a hood on.  Excuse me, sir.  Well, I had a hood.  Oh, exactly.  I like that.  You know, I mean, New York in general is safe as long as you're not stupid.  You got to be smart, but we're making it sound like it's crazy out there.  You live in the city.  You just got to be smart, though.  There's different rules.  You just don't buzz people in that are asking for a pen.  There's city rules and there's suburb rules. 
[01:28:00]  I now live by suburb rules.  My biggest danger is the home invasion, which we've talked about.  I do not want to be home invaded.  Never happens in Manhattan.  I mean, for that guy I ran in, but I mean, you don't have 10 gang members running in.  Yeah, not like 10 guys, and then they tie up the family with extension cords.  And there's not really home invasions going on in the suburbs, relatively speaking.  There's been five or six in the last year, and there's millions and millions of homes.  You ask those five or six.  There's millions and millions of homes. 
[01:28:30]  Why don't you build a panic room?  First of all, there were about 20.  He's building a panic room.  There were 20.  My old house is a panic room.  Yeah, he beat me to it.  It's a panic.  It's 20 families, I believe, were home invaded in Nassau County alone.  And you ask them if there were too many or too few as they tied them up with extension cords,  and the guy was probably going, you know, I was thinking about buying a blaster, and I didn't.  Right.  All right. 
[01:29:00]  We got to take...  Ow.  What happened?  He hit his head on the mic.  He banged his skull on the mic.  We got to take a break here.  It's the 25th anniversary of AIDS, so we got another sing-along for everybody.  Happy birthday to AIDS.  Just drove off-road laughing.  I always wondered if the people actually drive off the road.  I'd say never.  I never see them on the news.  Or is it one of those figurative of speeches?  Yeah.  Horrible accident today due to a radio joke as a car drove off the road.  Brian and Philly, what's up? 
[01:29:30]  Yes, I did just drive.  I was driving off the road laughing.  I wasn't paying attention.  Anthony, you just made me piss myself.  Oh, don't do that.  Well, why did you...  Brian?  Yes.  Are you still there?  Why did you drive off the road laughing?  Because I'm half asleep and it was an uncontrolled spasm of laughter.  What road are you on?  I-95.  What lane were you in?  The fast lane.  Wait, what made you laugh is all I'm saying. 
[01:30:00]  Anthony talking about the Good Samaritans getting popped over the head.  That's what happened.  Oh, okay.  Which way is north?  Yeah, yeah.  So, wait, wait, wait.  You were in the left lane.  How fast were you going?  Shut up, Jimmy.  I want to know.  I want to know.  70.  All right.  So, you drove off the road into what?  That little teeny shoulder there?  You didn't even hear the brrrr.  Well, that's what happened.  I heard the brrrr, and then I jumped back on the road.  By the way, I'll give people a little driving tip for those little brrrr, you know those brrrr things on the left side of the road? 
[01:30:30]  You're in the left lane, they're on the left side?  Yeah.  They are usually full of rocks and dirt.  If you get somebody tailgating you, you go right into those with one tire, and rocks and dirt will fly behind you and crack their windshield.  Oh, yeah, it's an amazing weapon to use in the war of the roads.  Yeah, the weapon is just sitting there waiting for you.  That's it.  It's right there because they're full of rocks and gravel.  I used to carry golf balls in my glove compartment.  Pennies were always my favorite. 
[01:31:00]  I did golf balls.  And Snapple bottles.  I would throw a taxi cab.  I would open up the passenger window and then sidearm it right into the side of the car that was bothering me.  Golf balls are good, but you can't really control how far they're going to go.  You could throw one like here in Midtown, and it can end up in a river.  Those things will bounce.  I know.  Then it's just bouncing all over the highway.  All right, we've got to take a break.  It's the 25th anniversary of AIDS today.  And in honor of that, another fine sing-along.  Everyone has AIDS. 
[01:31:30]  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Same age, same age, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  And so this is the end of our story.  And everyone is dead from AIDS.  It took from me my best friend.  It took from me my best friend, my only true pal, my only bright star.  He's not a hero.  Well, I'm going to march on Washington. 
[01:32:00]  Lead the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us.  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS.  My sister, AIDS.  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The gays and the straights and the whites and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS.  My grandma and my dog are all blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The Pope has got it and so do you.  Come on, everybody, we got quilting to do.  We're going to break down these barricades, everyone. 
[01:32:30]  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  This is the Opie and Anthony show, the O.A. virus spreading across America.  A bunch of cities jumping aboard today.  Detroit, Columbus, and Rochester, New York.  More to come. More to come, people.  More to come in the coming weeks, I guess, right? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Well, we know Washington's like three weeks from today.  Yep.  And then maybe others in the coming weeks.  Maybe.  We were just looking at AIDS on TV.  25th anniversary of AIDS.  How do they know, like, this is the day?  Like, they picked this day as the 25th anniversary of AIDS.  Like, what happened 25 years ago?  I have no idea.  They just, like, I was going to say pulled it out of there.  Well, there. 
[01:33:30]  Could have very well been.  The stand, though?  Yes, it's actually the first.  Today, 25 years ago, first person was diagnosed with AIDS officially.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, fella.  Yeah, thank you.  He went in, like, I got this cough.  Thanks a lot, Gary.  Thanks.  Thanks, Brad.  Bruce.  Thanks a lot, Henri.  Thanks a lot, mustache guy.  Thanks a million, Chip. 
[01:34:00]  25 years.  Remember 25 years ago, or even 20 years ago, five years in,  when they were projecting that by now, like, half the world would have it,  and it would just be this huge thing that would affect everybody and blah, blah, blah.  And I understand.  Believe me.  If you're affected by it or you have a family member affected by it,  it's probably awful, probably horrible.  But, you know, people deal with family members with heart disease and cancer 
[01:34:30]  and other horrid diseases on a daily basis, where's that?  No, we got to look at that guy swabbing out his smoky throat every morning  with the cancer kazoo.  AIDS gets, like, this special place in diseasedom that I don't really get.  Well, they don't crucify the behavior that causes it.  Like, with smoking, they relentlessly attack the behavior that causes the disease. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  It's fine.  But it's like with AIDS, they kind of, they attack the behavior very softly,  like, think responsibly, be responsible.  There's not this vilification or crucifixion of the irresponsible behavior,  which leads to a lot of it.  And we seem to really be aware of AIDS all around the world.  Like, everybody's saying, please, you know, you don't understand how big this is in Africa  that we have to help the people in Africa with AIDS. 
[01:35:30]  Do you know how many people smoke in Africa and die of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes?  Difference is, though, you're not going to have...  Shopping each other up in machetes.  You're not going to have sex with someone who's smoking and catch their cancer?  That's the only problem.  That's the only thing I care about is if somebody can't, like, you know,  put their cancer all over me.  Because they could creep up on you and kind of give you the AIDS?  Is that why it gives you...  What if you hook up?  I mean, it's just, you know, you bank someone...  You make a good point there.  It's kind of like, it kind of jumps out and grabs you.  AIDS is something you... 
[01:36:00]  It's a disease you give to each other.  That's the big problem.  Well, things like heart disease, hereditary.  Exactly.  Things like that.  But again, that could be something where...  It's not random with strangers.  Someone's not going to...  Dave and Phoenix, I don't know how much of this is going to fly.  The difference, Anthony, is you can't F another man in the A and get heart disease.  Well, you could get heartbreak, though, if he leaves you.  Certainly.  Well, there you go.  But who knows if that made the radio.  Well, you never know if the guy's down the hall. 
[01:36:30]  Hey, you brought up another thing.  The red ribbons.  Where did they go?  What happened?  Where did the red ribbons go?  Remember, every celebrity wore them.  And some people were chastised for not wearing the red ribbons to award shows and stuff.  25 years later, I kind of forgot about the red ribbons.  Who got chastised?  There were some celebrities that wouldn't go out on stage with the red ribbons.  Not that they didn't support it, but they saw it as some kind of hokey, like we're being forced.  After a few years, it got to the point where at the Oscars and stuff, you were forced, before you went out, to stick this ribbon on you. 
[01:37:00]  And it seemed kind of like a hokey, contrived thing instead of some sincerity.  So some people said, no, I'm not wearing that.  I do my own, you know, I support it in my own way.  And they were starting to be like, you know, like communists.  Toad, you know?  No.  I don't remember.  If you look on the internet, you'll probably find it.  By the way, enough with the ribbons.  I don't even know what they mean anymore.  There's so many colors out there all representing something. 
[01:37:30]  Yellow means that you've come back from a three-year prison stint, and she still wants you.  If it's tied around an old oak tree.  Why wouldn't you just call this bitch?  She's got to tell everybody on the bus, she might not want me anymore, and the whole bus cheers.  Shut up.  I've got to pass by and see if there's a ribbon around the tree.  She tied a hundred.  Oh, good.  She's a psychopath.  Can someone do some ribbon research for us, by the way?  There's got to be a website.  Yeah.  What color ribbon means what?  Yellow means missing somebody. 
[01:38:00]  All I know is you drive around.  Somebody.  The Long Island Expressway, all you see is ribbons.  All different colors.  Yellow is for the, now it's for the troops to come home.  It's for people coming home from anywhere, like a prison or something.  You tie a ribbon around the tree at home.  We all know the yellow ribbon, of course.  Pink is breast cancer.  All right, pink is breast cancer.  That's the breast cancer one.  Red is AIDS.  Red is the AIDS.  And most of those are on the side of the highway.  Purple?  The red ones blew off the car, and they didn't replace them.  They just let them go.  What's purple, E-Rock? 
[01:38:30]  Multiple meanings.  Multiple meanings?  How about giving us one?  Yeah.  How about you do something?  Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Which one, what color is that?  It says purple.  Different every day.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Just spin the wheel.  Also standard.  You know what's great?  It probably meant something else, and people wanted one for Alzheimer's.  They're like, ah, purple.  They won't know.  They won't know.  I need one.  What the hell is this?  You just touch it.  Why is there a ribbon on me?  Exactly.  Happy birthday to...  No, it's not your birthday, Grandpa. 
[01:39:00]  Take it out of your hair.  You look like a goose.  Doddering ass.  It also means pancreatic cancer.  What?  Yeah.  Wait, the Alzheimer's one is pancreatic cancer?  What color?  Purple.  Purple.  Oh, man.  The pancreatic cancer people got to be pissed off they're sharing it with Alzheimer's.  Well, the Alzheimer's ones were on the lapel.  The pancreatic cancer ones just cram it up.  If you get a purple ribbon for pancreatic cancer, it comes with a mallet.  That's a bad one, though. 
[01:39:30]  The pancreatic.  I had an ant go from that one, and man.  And who else?  Michael Landon had that one.  Boom.  That one is so quick, that ribbon barely even fades.  You barely get it out of the packaging.  That's it.  You're done.  That's a really bad one.  Pancreatic cancer.  What's a green ribbon?  It's going to be some hippie tree-hugging one.  It says environmental and missing children.  What?  Gee, I think missing kids is probably more important than a big tree they want to chop down.  What the hell is a ribbon going to do to help the missing kids? 
[01:40:00]  I don't know.  It's also leukemia.  Holy Jesus.  Are you kidding me?  What is red?  Is it only AIDS, or is it something else, too?  Red is only AIDS.  Someone is saying red is also for mad.  Well, there's against...  Really?  I want to start a ribbon.  I want to get a multi-colored ribbon and have it mean a bunch of things that are completely  self-centered and important.  Better career?  Like a red and green one together, that's for the delivery I didn't get.  Oh, something bad that happened to you, yet it's so self-centered. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, that nobody else would...  The wrong furniture was delivered to you, something like that.  But I'll say it's for the wrong furniture who's been delivered to all people.  Oh, where?  Right.  The red one, and I'll confuse everyone.  Oh, God.  My mechanic screwed up my car.  It's a gray ribbon.  Here we go.  Let's go to Renee in Long Island.  Listen to this one.  Renee.  Hi, good morning.  My son's graduation from Queens College on Thursday, most of the students were wearing  these little white ribbons, and that was basically for illegal immigration rights, that all these 
[01:41:00]  students who had graduated college now couldn't get a job.  And that was basically...  And everybody...  And they were giving out the ribbons.  I mean, quite a few people...  Oh, so it was supporting, like, whitey?  I have no idea why white was the operative color, and people were wearing them.  Well, if you're saying it was to support the white kids that can't get jobs,  because of the...  No, it wasn't.  No way.  No, a college would never do that.  Are you kidding me?  They were supporting... 
[01:41:30]  Supporting the Mexicans.  ...immigration and immigration?  Probably supporting illegal immigration, how they want to, you know, to be more official.  There was a big protest, actually, and this is why people on a certain side of the spectrum  you make me want to throw up.  The guys, the Minutemen, were protesting outside the Mexican embassy, and the people  that are for immigrants being, like, given complete amnesty were chanting,  racists go home.  If you're against these...  Oh, I want to bite their faces.  If you're against them on this side of the issue, you're a racist. 
[01:42:00]  A racist, yeah.  Emotionally blackmailing scumbags.  How about I just don't agree with you politically on allowing people to come in here  without going through the proper channels?  How about that?  I would love to get one of these guys on the phone and ask them, why is it a racial issue?  The second a group of any one race gets together to do something, like one amnesty,  or they get together to try to skip over some rules, let's say, that are put in place  for everyone else, the second you call them on it, you're a racist. 
[01:42:30]  Of course.  That's just the way it is.  You know what it is?  I mean, quite a few, and it's like you said before about the whole thing, quite a few of  the students refused to wear the white ribbon because they didn't agree with the issue.  They felt that a lot of these kids, they were children.  Good.  There was a reason why they couldn't have had some kind of citizenship, and those students  who didn't want to wear the ribbon actually got flack.  Of course, they probably got booed at by the most of the kids.  I would have worn it right on my junk, like right on my fly, I would have worn it. 
[01:43:00]  Colleges are the greatest group of followers.  They are followers.  They're just knee-jerk reactionary followers.  It's really depressing.  Yeah.  Like, didn't they used to be at the forefront of like a free thought type thing, and now  they are just a bunch of uptight, frightened, knee-jerk reaction followers.  Why can't we just wear armbands that are black, red, and white with certain patterns on them, 
[01:43:30]  let's say?  Anthony.  Cody in Indiana.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  The only ribbon more ridiculous than the getter done for diabetes is the, and I swear  to God, brown ribbon for colon cancer.  Okay.  At least it makes sense.  Brown ribbon.  At least it makes sense.  There's a getter done for diabetes?  Yeah, because, you know, we can't go to any gas station or supermarket without seeing  Larry the Cable Guy's stupid face plastered on something. 
[01:44:00]  And most people are so stupid, they get their ribbons in places where the money doesn't  even go toward the cause.  No, no.  They just assume like, oh, wow, this savage that's selling it at his gas station, he's  giving all that money to diabetes.  Yeah.  No, he's not.  If Ahmad Mohammed is selling one of those Armstrong cancer bracelets in his gas station convenience  store, guaranteed the money isn't going to cancer. 
[01:44:30]  Believe me.  All right, listen.  So we got a little ribbons discussion going on.  Lakeside, Ohio.  Yeah.  We got the story we talked about earlier.  The town where no one locks their doors.  I saw this yesterday morning.  You got to hear some of this audio.  It's just ridiculous.  Reporter goes into homes.  I was describing this.  He couldn't believe that this was true, so he was just walking into homes.  But what makes this place really special, what sets it apart from almost every 
[01:45:00]  other town in America, is that here in Lakeside, people still actually trust one another.  A lot of towns like to brag that you don't have to lock your doors.  But here at Lakeside, it's more than a cliche.  Here you feel like you really could just walk into some total random stranger's house unannounced.  That's what I want to hear.  Just bring in a camera. 
[01:45:30]  House unannounced.  Bring in a camera with absolutely no explanation.  And still feel perfectly welcome.  So you know why he had the camera.  Usually when these news programs do these pieces, they have the tiny cameras that are hidden, right?  A hidden camera.  So you get the real reaction.  He's not even that trusting.  He's like, make sure you get one of those old-fashioned cameramen to follow me.  Big camera.  Like, he's just barging in.  Who knows if the...  I mean, you might have caught, like, the scene from The Shining with the guy in the pig mask. 
[01:46:00]  Right, right.  Who the hell knows what he's walking into?  Right.  Of course, it's pre-screened.  Stop it.  Yeah, he's a little scared.  And, you know, he assumes if he's got the big camera, that'll help his cause, too.  Couple's feeling a little frisky, like they want to do it on the kitchen table.  Hello.  How are you?  Well, I'm walking in because your door's unlocked.  I'll have a lemonade.  And still feel perfectly welcome.  It took me a few tries.  Hello?  I could have had some lovely furniture. 
[01:46:30]  Hello?  But eventually...  Hi.  Hi.  Good morning.  How you doing?  Okay.  You don't have any lemonade, do you?  I don't think I have any lemonade.  Okay.  How about some iced tea?  Iced tea would be good.  See what I mean?  And these people didn't know me from Adam.  They really just barged in.  I'm Steve Hartman.  Would you both like some iced tea?  Seriously.  We were just trying to make a point.  We were just trying to make a point.  That worked out nice. 
[01:47:00]  That worked out nice.  That was my stupid news guy voice.  Blah, blah, blah.  That worked out nice.  Someone writes, notice the reporter's not black.  Yeah, I think...  Steven from Bayshore.  I think you'd get a different reaction.  Would you like some grape soda?  This is supposedly a gated community.  The reaction would be, holy S, this is why we moved here.  Oh my God.  Don't touch me.  We didn't move far enough away.  No, I'm a reporter.  Understand, I'm a reporter. 
[01:47:30]  Yes, but we've never seen reporters like you before.  We've seen porters of your color.  A porter is in a...  No, I'm a reporter.  I don't care how many times you do it.  Get out of my house.  All right.  If you expect the best of people, guess what, Anthony?  Yes.  Guess what you get in return?  A spat hat.  And you still haven't even seen the half of it.  Where else in America does somebody find a $20 bill  and put up signs telling you where you can claim it? 
[01:48:00]  This town is so trusting.  In all my years, I've never seen anyone lock their bike.  Is it surprising to some people when they come here for the first time?  Oh, yes.  They can't believe it.  You tell them you don't need a lock?  You don't need a lock.  Jackie Seifert runs Seifert Cycles.  When you rent a bike from her,  she doesn't ask for a driver's license, credit card, nothing.  She just trusts you to bring it back.  We've never had a bike stolen in 28 years. 
[01:48:30]  Never.  Never.  If you expect the best from people,  that's what you're going to receive.  I can't wait till her head is on the handlebars like a headlight.  Please, God.  And someone puts her feet on the pedals.  They return the bike helmet with her head in it.  Her head in it.  Please let 40 of those people be massacred.  Oh, that whole town.  Just in one night.  Yeah, CBS is blowing up their spot now  because you've got to think there's criminals out there smart enough.  They know where to go. 
[01:49:00]  How did these cold-blooded killers know about this town?  Your broadcast, perhaps?  Brian from Washington, D.C.  How funny would it be if the reporter went into the Dateline NBC pedophile house?  Do you know who I am?  Do you know who I am?  I'm doing a report on unlocked doors.  You're a pedophile.  No, I'm not.  The door was unlocked.  Of course it was. 
[01:49:30]  We're catching kid touchers.  I was just looking for lemonade.  Some lemonade.  Oh, so now you want lemonade,  which is known to be a child's drink.  No, I'm just showing that the doors are opened.  Doors are opened for the likes of you pedophiles here on Dateline.  He opens the door.  I spilled some iced tea on my soda.  I'll be right out.  Uh-oh.  I better leave.  I just said I spilled some iced tea on my soda.  On my soda.  Good word. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, you.  Dang.  Well, that'd be even a bigger mess  because you'd have a conglomerated  mulatto mongrel class of beverage.  Listen, I'm reading more ribbon things here.  Yeah.  And I was just giggling.  This silver stands for Parkinson's disease,  children with disabilities.  Any disease or disorders of the brain,  including mental illness and strokes  and abuse of the elderly.  It should be silver with a black circle  like where the eye was punched.  What is wrong with me? 
[01:50:30]  What's wrong with me?  I don't know.  I'm not wearing a silver ribbon  to signify abuse of the elderly.  It's hilarious.  Do you know there's a periwinkle ribbon  for pulmonary hypertension?  Yeah.  Nice.  If you've got to start explaining  the color of your ribbon.  Hey, we've got two more clips  from this fine town in Lakeside, Ohio,  the town where no one locks their doors.  No one.  We'll do that after the break, okay?  Hey, going into break,  you want to do some Tippy Tom radio? 
[01:51:00]  Another taste of Tippy Tom radio?  If it's funny, I'll hear it.  Religion.  Is this last clip all right?  Religion and he stumbles to the finish?  I think so.  All right.  We do homeless radio when we're on XM  because we have a lot more time  to just kind of hang and do our show.  And one day we decided to go home early,  so we had a homeless guy  just take over the show.  We just had a mic  and our buddy Than  taking phone calls  for Tippy Tom,  a real homeless guy,  and he just sat there  and did a talk show for us. 
[01:51:30]  He's got scabies.  For like a half hour  or 40 minutes,  whatever it was.  And this is him  talking about religion  and then stumbling  to the end  of his homeless radio program.  Homeless radio.  Listen to this.  Do you believe in God?  Well,  God according to who?  According to the Bible.  Let's start with.  Which Bible?  King James.  Why not God?  Why not the Koran?  Well,  let's hear your thoughts.  You got to talk about 
[01:52:00]  what God is talking about.  According to what God?  According to what?  You're right.  That's why I'm an atheist.  What is an atheist?  Wait,  you're asking me questions now?  It's someone  who doesn't believe in God.  What's a...  Somebody that doesn't...  No.  Okay.  Agnostic.  I'll go that way.  Oh, okay.  Could go either way.  God exists,  but I don't know  where he's at.  Okay?  All right. 
[01:52:30]  So,  who am I supposed  to believe in?  Whoever you want, Tom.  I believe in me.  Oh.  All right.  I believe in my mom  and my dad.  I believe in my children.  And I believe  in people like you.  Okay?  I believe in people  that help me.  And also,  I help.  And that's what  I believe in.  I don't believe  in nothing else  but that.  I got one life  to live.  I got about  40 years left  if I make it.  And that's it.  And you guys 
[01:53:00]  maybe got the same  amount of time  as I got.  Let's hope not.  And that's it.  And we're gone.  Where are you gonna go?  I don't know.  It'll be an Anthony show.  They'll rock you  till you puke.  Puke?  Like throw up?  Why would I want  to do that?  Yeah, it's the  Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Being heard  for the first time  in Detroit today.  WXYT AM 1270.  I say that  because we've been 
[01:53:30]  looking for shootouts  today to make  Detroit feel at home.  Wood floor in New York.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing this morning, guys?  All right.  What do you got?  I got a Smith & Wesson 500  and I'm actually  on power talk  at the minute.  Smith & Wesson.  Smith & Wesson 500  which is a 50 caliber.  Yeah, 50 cal, man.  This is a handheld cannon.  And I happen to be  on power talk  at the moment.  What do we get  in the power talk cameras  for this side  of the opening  I see the computers  and the cameras  in our office 
[01:54:00]  but they're not hooked up.  We saw that last week.  I know.  Is there a new iMac?  Oh, Jimmy wants an iMac.  Yes, we'll get  an iMac.  You'll be making music  and all kinds of fun stuff.  We were just watching  the early show  and they had the Sopranos  guys on like Sharipa.  I mean, I understand  he does his show  with Howard's girlfriend.  That's probably why  he canceled it  which is fine  but it's like, dude,  can't you just call  and say that?  Can't people just go,  look, man,  I'd like to do the show  but I have a copy of this.  He was scheduled  and then Howard got to him  and then he canceled  and ran away  like a little pussy.  Or at least just, 
[01:54:30]  I mean, look,  I don't even blame him  on that one  but just say  I can't do the show  because I'm too close  to Howard.  Just give us  a little honesty.  Like a little honesty  on this show.  All right, Woodford, go.  Okay, I got to put  the phone down.  This is going to be  on Pal Talk  so a lot of people  checking out the show  on Pal Talk,  they get to see this.  Hey, what are you  shooting into?  He put the phone down.  Here we go!  Hello, Detroit.  Welcome, Detroit, 
[01:55:00]  to the Opian Anthony Virus.  What did you shoot into?  Actually, I have  some old stereos  set up at a range  I have on some property  I own.  Very nice.  So I just blew  apart some old stereos.  All right, very nice.  Thank you, Woodfloor.  You're welcome.  All right, there he goes  from New York.  By the way,  I was talking about  my digital camera  that I lost.  I'm really bummed, too,  because I took a lot  of pictures of cougars  over the weekend.  I was cougar-watching  down there in Philly  with a bunch of the boys.  A lot of them  are probably dead right now  so you'll never get them again.  What? 
[01:55:30]  A lot of them probably  died by the time  you took the photos  so you'll never get them.  I was just taking  pictures of cougar asses.  That was my thing  and I was going to have  a whole thing  on our website.  My night in Philly  watching cougars.  Watching cougars.  And they actually played  It's Raining Men  because it was raining  and it was an outdoor bar  and we were all under  like a tent.  But a lot of the cougars  had to run outside  in the rain  when they played  It's Raining Men  and they're bopping  and they're banging  into each other.  Their hips are... 
[01:56:00]  Of course they are.  It was just god-awful.  Of course,  for the new audience,  cougars are these older ladies  that dress in clothes  that 25-year-olds  should be wearing  and they're...  And they prowl  for young guys.  And they're prowling  for the young ones.  And then...  Do they wear ribbons  the color of prunes  to represent their ovaries?  But I had some great shots  of cougars  while we were cougar-watching.  Aw.  And they're just thinking  they were all that.  How you doing, honey?  And they caught me  taking pictures  of their butts  but they thought 
[01:56:30]  I was taking pictures  of them  because I thought  they were hot.  No, I was taking a picture  of your big asses.  Oh.  But then some black ladies  came walking by.  Old and black ladies.  Yeah, yeah.  And someone down there  might have been Kenny  goes,  those are the Black Panthers.  The Black Panthers  instead of cougar.  Get it?  No, it wasn't that Kenny.  Oh, I thought it was that Kenny.  It was Lindsey's brother.  It sounded like  one of the jokes  that Kenny would have said.  He calls them Black Panthers.  It's the cougars  that are black. 
[01:57:00]  And they're on the prowl, too.  Of course.  Speaking of black,  Francine is in studio.  Francine.  Hi, Francine.  Hello, everybody.  What did I tell you  before you came back?  You like my hair?  Yeah.  And what did I say  about your hair, though?  It looks good.  I said that  you're very bangable  because of your hair.  Oh, really?  Much more bangable  because of the hair.  Thank you.  How about that?  Thank you.  She's our little ebony princess.  Comes in every so often. 
[01:57:30]  And she does the news.  And she's a blithering idiot.  That's pretty much it.  I don't like putting it  into those terms,  but we got to do this show  pretty quickly.  I beg to differ.  So I could...  Okay.  Yeah, so we could sum it up  by saying you're a blithering idiot.  Dumb as a doorknob.  But just sweet as punch.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah.  I appreciate it.  No problem.  She's not sweet.  She's a disconnected sociopath.  Yeah, she's got problems.  She's nuts.  She has no love for anyone. 
[01:58:00]  She grew up pretty wealthy,  I guess, in Connecticut, right?  Do we have the Francine story  that she told  on the other side  of this program?  The Francine story  on Lifetime.  You don't have it here?  You know the one  I'm talking about?  Don't say it.  Oh, that one.  Wow.  Can you bring it in for tomorrow?  Good luck.  All right, bring it in for tomorrow.  For the new listeners,  we're going to play some tomorrow  and it's this girl  that's in studio.  It's unbelievable.  One of your stories.  She likes to tell stories.  All right.  True life.  Let's do some news  with Francine.  You don't want to put her 
[01:58:30]  in the booth?  That's how it was done  in the old days.  No, huh?  No.  All right.  We let our black women  sit out here with us.  Yeah, we allow that.  Thank you.  No problem.  Don't lock them up  in a glass booth.  Stay out of here.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  All right.  Francine with the news.  What do you got?  By the way,  Howie Math today,  Howie's trying to tell  his listeners that  he has a bigger audience  than The Tonight Show.  What?  That's the latest  Howie Math today. 
[01:59:00]  Is that the Howie Math  he's doing?  He says his audience  is bigger than  The Tonight Show.  You know, just stop it.  No one's buying anything.  Come on.  It's embarrassing.  Whatever.  All right.  Let's go, Francine.  Iran's top leader.  This is how our news goes.  It's just right into it.  Ayatollah, Ali.  Wait, wait.  Start over.  Ayatollah.  Hey, I had the Ayatollah.  Oh.  Hey.  The Wise Guys Show  and that must be a real hoot 
[01:59:30]  to a bunch of  the Soprano guys joke.  Hey, she got a piece  of bagadouche.  Ah.  Hey, how'd you know  you liked her?  I had a big cannoli.  Bah.  Bah.  Bah.  Yeah, did you?  Ha, ha, ha.  I can't believe  Shrepper didn't come in.  Yeah, whatever.  Hey, look at that.  Yeah, she got a set of  like,  took a bagel.  Ha, ha, ha.  Blech.  For laugh a minute.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  Hey.  Hey, look at that.  You're over there  acting like a  fatigadoo.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You dopes.  Shut up.  One more.  One more.  I don't have any more.  All right.  Why am I over here?  You treat me like  I'm a big-a-dee star.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, how about  get out of here  before we, uh, we,  we bury you?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  No, don't bury me.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:00:30]  Why don't you shut up?  Anyway, Francine with the news.  Start over.  Here we go.  Hey, she's pretty hot  for a piece of madousa.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yuck.  Stupid.  All right, Francine,  let's go.  Here we go.  All right.  Iran's top leader,  Ayatollah Ali Kalamanehi,  warned yesterday  that oil shipments  from Gulf region  will be disrupted 
[02:01:00]  if the U.S.  attacks his nation.  He said in his speech,  if you make any mistake,  definitely shipment of energy  from this region  will be jeopardized.  Uh, why don't you try this  while you're being nuked, douche?  Someone should start  a memoir out in D.C.  Call it Operation Remembering Iraq  and Operation Remembering Afghanistan  and mail it to this silly goose. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, she does a little news  and then a little commentary.  I forgot she does the commentary, too.  She editorializes.  Well, what was his first name,  by the way?  Ayatollah.  Ayatollah.  Ayatollah.  You know how you take care  of the Ayatollah?  You send a few of the wise guys  over there.  Hey.  What are you doing over there?  Everybody gets crazy.  Forget about it.  We're going to whack him.  We're going to whack him.  Forget about it.  Well, forget about it.  We're going to hit him  with a bucket of hooves.  All right, we'll be right back. 
[02:02:00]  Okay, will you?  That's entertaining  for ten minutes.  Yeah, not even.  They're doing it  for months already,  if not years.  All right.  That's like Johnny Sox  always says.  What does he always say?  Francine, go ahead.  What's the news?  Francine.  O.J. Simpson  can't seem to stay out  of the news,  and now he's popping up  in a new sex flick. 
[02:02:30]  The flick is called  You Got Juiced in Your Face,  which can be bought  for a measly $19.95  at www.BadOJ.com.  Can you give out  that website again?  www.BadOJ.com.  That's to you, W.  Surprisingly, O.J. is denying  that he is indeed  the man in the videotape.  You're right, Jess.  Hold on.  Is this the sex tape?  Yeah.  And he said  You Got Juiced? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the other tape  he does.  That's his prank tape.  No, she said  You Got Juiced on your face.  See, yeah,  she was pulling in  and You Got Juiced on.  Wow, look at me.  I'm not smart enough  to get what she does.  Opie.  This guy's got  to find out  juice for brains.  Wow.  All right, very good.  Thank you.  You incorporated  the name of his other tape  into the sex tape  because You Got Juiced  is...  You're smarter  than I thought.  Thank you. 
[02:03:30]  The video...  He claims  that he is not  the man in the videotape.  Dummies.  Just like R. Kelly.  The videotape never lies.  This isn't vanilla sky,  you douche.  Open up to your publicity stunt.  Admit you're doing it  for the money.  And while you're at it,  get AIDS and die.  Wow.  Wow.  That's coming from  a black woman.  Timely.  The black people  usually support the OJ.  I don't. 
[02:04:00]  You don't?  Well, have you seen  a clip from the OJ tape?  I hear he's got a...  Wow.  He's got a...  He's got an eggplant on him.  It's, yeah,  from what I saw,  Rivals Tommy Lee.  Wow-wee.  First time Poe's  been in the studio.  No kidding.  We got very,  very hot girls  in the studio.  I just feel like  I gotta just keep  making eye contact.  I refuse.  Like, to be a professional,  I gotta look and go, 
[02:04:30]  hi ladies, hi.  And then,  and then,  because there's so many,  usually if there's just one,  you could sneak and go like that.  Or down, you know.  But when there's so many,  you know,  they could see you look.  Yeah, we're all watching you.  Might as well just...  Yeah.  Walk.  Six bikini girls.  This is very lovely.  We got six...  I don't know.  We were just walking around.  Six bikini girls.  Five of them are hot.  I was sunbathing.  They're all...  Really?  Yeah.  Can't you know?  Sunbathing out in this lovely,  lovely weather. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  What are you girls doing?  We're hanging out with you.  You're hanging out with us?  Is that it?  Totally.  No, really,  we're actually promoting  The Omen.  So, today we have  the Mark of the Beast  on us somewhere.  Oh, each one of you?  You guys have to like...  Hit it.  Have the 666 somewhere  on you.  Oh, nice.  Let's see.  I'm gonna have to cut you open  to see,  because I think it's  inside you somewhere.  Do we get to like  look for it on you?  Is it obvious? 
[02:05:30]  It's not obvious.  It's not obvious?  Is it covered by your bikini?  No.  It's a more obvious spot  than that.  More obvious spot.  It's lower back?  What?  Different sizes.  It's always good.  Oh, different sizes  and places and stuff.  Could you...  Wow.  What is she saying?  I was just saying  that the mark  could be anywhere on it.  Yeah.  So it's not in the same place.  Oh, okay.  So on one,  it could be on the back. 
[02:06:00]  On another,  it could be like  your neck somewhere.  And what does the mark  look like?  It's getting warm.  It's a 666.  Oh, it's just 666  somewhere on your body?  It's gonna be  on the back of your neck.  It's gonna be  on your lower back  and the hairline.  Anyone here  have a foot fetish?  A foot fetish?  I don't,  but I'll suck toes  to be a good egg.  Why?  Is it on your toes?  It's a hint.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's a hint?  Okay, um,  so Heather Mills  only has a 6  and a 3. 
[02:06:30]  3, 3, 3.  No, a 6 and...  Oh, yeah,  that'd be funnier.  Oh, no,  that's so mean.  Ah, finally got it.  Yeah, that is really mean.  He's the meanest guy  ever, ever, ever.  He really is.  Boy, I'm still trying  to figure it out,  by the way.  He looks like a teddy bear.  I'm like,  what are they mean?  So what are you guys  doing with us today?  You're walking over?  Yeah, they're gonna do  the walk from here  to XM, right?  Finally.  So we got six girls  in very, very small bikinis  and they will be doing  the walk with us  from here to XM  and they're promoting  the omen, right?  Do you have any omen signs? 
[02:07:00]  Where's your signs?  They're all on our bodies.  No, but I mean,  but all the people  on 57th Street,  they're not gonna be able  to believe me.  I'd love to start...  But women in bikinis,  they're gonna stop.  Yeah, they'll stop.  They'll go,  what is that?  And you'll go,  there's an omen thing on me  and they'll touch you  and yell,  don't unhandle me.  No, no.  No touching a lot.  People that the movie  is coming out tomorrow  which is 666  and we've got  the mark of the devil  on us  and so it's hidden  just like on the kid  in the movie.  Right. 
[02:07:30]  Lil' cute,  tussleable Damien.  What do you do  for like normal?  You don't just walk around  like...  No, actually,  I spend my whole life  walking around  the streets of New York  in a bikini.  It's gotta be...  It's gotta be an occupation.  Are you strippers?  What do you do?  Ow.  We, unfortunately...  Take a while to guess  what we do.  I don't...  We're in New York City  and we're standing  in our...  Do you dance?  Do you dance?  They're models. 
[02:08:00]  Mostly actors.  Oh, actors,  models,  do commercials.  Anyone been in a commercial?  Nope.  Sure.  You have?  You look familiar.  Well, I don't know.  She's a funky one.  Don't ask her.  She goes off in Russia.  I don't know.  A couple of these  looks familiar  for some reason.  All right,  we'll continue  this terrific interview  downstairs in the lobby.  The girls are gonna  walk with us  to XM today.  The Omen comes out  tomorrow, obviously.  Francine,  thanks for doing  some news stories  for us.  No problem.  Do you wanna come 
[02:08:30]  to XM with us?  Do a few more?  Sure.  All right,  Francine,  with her hot new look,  will be joining us  at XM in a little while.  Guys, thanks a lot.  Once again,  thanks to Detroit,  Columbus,  and Rochester  for joining  this fine program,  the ONA virus  spreading across America.  The O.P. and Anthony  Show.  XM 202.  I'm Jim Norton,  and I'm on the radio.  Jim Norton,  from The O.P. and Anthony  Show.  You stay with me,  Jim Norton. 
[02:09:00]  Friday, June 9th,  Jim Norton will be  signing copies of his  HBO One Night Stand DVD  at Tower Records  at Lincoln Center.  Beginning at 6 p.m.,  meet Jim Norton,  get his new  One Night Stand DVD,  and grab a preview copy  of Lucky Louie,  Episode 1,  the new HBO sitcom  featuring little Jimmy Norton.  I'm an entertainer.  Friday, June 9th,  Tower Records,  Lincoln Center,  starting at 6 p.m.  The O.P. and Anthony  XM walkover  begins now.  Here we are. 
[02:09:30]  Wait.  Outside the, uh...  Is this on?  Steve, is this on?  Of our FM show.  Now we're on XM.  Anthony, can you hear me?  I can hear you,  little Jimmy.  Am I on the air?  I hear you, Jimmy.  I can't hear me.  And, uh,  now we're gonna take  our little stroll.  It's a little chilly.  Holy mackerel.  We're on the air  on this June 5th.  For the love of God,  when the hell  is summer coming?  It's a little cold.  Oh, they got a little  more dressed than they were.  Of course they did. 
[02:10:00]  A little more dressed.  Of course they did.  O.P. just completely  disgusted.  Why are they wearing  their bikinis?  O.P. is just disgusted  all the time  with any of these girls.  I don't know.  That was funny, too.  You're like,  one of them isn't hot.  Oh, you heard that?  Yeah.  How come you girls  are all,  where's your bikini,  like, where's your  bikini bottoms?  Uh, they're under,  they're under my shorts.  Because they're cold.  But what's the use  of walking over in,  why didn't you wear  the bottoms?  Well, because we have 
[02:10:30]  to leave a little bit  to the imagination.  So if people ask,  then they can just stop.  Imagination sucks.  All right, let's,  let's walk.  I've had enough  of the fucking makeup.  There you go.  Guys,  you need to bring  more girls on your show,  do we?  See what happens?  Every fucking time.  Yep.  Well, this wasn't enough.  Whenever they say  leave it to the imagination,  it means fucking cock tease.  How about this?  Let's do some,  we get over there,  let's do some more  wise guys jokes  because I can't stop 
[02:11:00]  laughing about those  fucking morons  and their fucking  awful sense of humor.  Wow, this is really  an impressive parade today.  Yeah, there's a bunch  of chicks walking  with fucking jeans  and bikini tops.  No one's stopping to ask.  No one cares.  How pathetic are we?  We almost have  girls in bikinis.  Here's the thing.  Almost.  This is,  what they should have  given them was signs  that say the omen too  because you would look  at people walking.  And they should be like  in full bikinis,  not shorts or anything.  This was supposed to promote 
[02:11:30]  the omen that starts tomorrow.  Look at that lady's bald spot.  Six, six, six.  That was awful.  But the women are just  in their bikini.  I do actually want to see  the new omen.  She got a Fred Mertz hairdo.  All right.  Let's see all the people  stopping the girls  to examine them.  They don't even have a sign.  There's no signs.  They should have six, six, six  in the course they should.  In really, really,  really big font.  In big red on their stomachs  and backs and legs and asses.  Why is Iraq even bothering 
[02:12:00]  to take a picture?  Oh, just take a picture  of his boards.  Because he's an F-A double G-Oct.  Let's just...  And we're not stopping  for Mac.  Hey, it's that guy.  How about tell Mac  to go fuck himself  and get a job?  Mac or Max?  I said Max one day  is that Mac.  Then I say Mac  and they say...  No, it's Max.  It's Max.  He drops down, sir.  Is it Max?  How he looked.  Max.  Sir?  Pardon me.  Oh, now they're...  Are they trying to talk?  Hey, four eyes.  Hey, see what the girls  are doing, Jimmy,  if anything's going on.  Nice third grade. 
[02:12:30]  All right, so where is this 666  because no one  has stopped you so far?  Yeah, so you have to  try and figure it out.  So, like, ask us, you know.  Each of us has to do it  in a different spot, so...  Okay, where is it?  Look for it.  No, you have to look for it.  But you won't let me touch you  so I can't look.  How am I going to look for it  if it's not...  Yes, you can get it.  All right, turn around.  All right, let's see.  Oh, there it is.  See?  I'll show you mine  if you show me yours.  Oh.  On the toe, baby.  On the toe.  That's so small. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, yeah, you can barely see it.  Oh, wow, this is impressive.  Very hard to see  the sign of the beast.  Let's get the fuck off the street.  Oh, don't even look at him.  I'd rather see if Max...  Max has it right on his cock.  I'll check with my mouth.  Oh, this is just so annoying.  We just saw it.  It can't be...  How small was that?  It's fucking awful.  Hey.  Hey, Max.  Hi, Max.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, go get a fucking job, shit dick.  Dudes, we're walking right in  and have him just stand outside.  Exactly.  Awkwardly.  They're nervous.  They should have big red 666s 
[02:13:30]  on their stomach,  which would make everybody look...  Yeah.  And people are like,  why don't you have more girls on your show?  That's why.  Listen to this horse shit.  Here's an Omen sign.  There it is.  All right.  Where?  What?  There's an Omen sign.  It's big.  You can see it.  We've never walked faster than that.  No, we're not.  Oh, my God.  This is the fucking...  This is record setting.  We usually do this walk to kill time.  Watch how fast we're upstairs.  You're listening to us do cardio.  Don't even say thank you.  Just walk right in.  Walk right in.  Right in.  Not a word.  There you go. 
[02:14:00]  Let them stand there awkwardly.  Ditch them.  They're not coming upstairs.  They're not coming upstairs, Kenny.  Whoa!  Opie just walked into a wall.  I'm so annoyed.  That was nice.  The second half of the ONA show starts in moments.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites  to fight the forces of evil. 
[02:14:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my sweet.  Jeez.  With Opie.  I don't want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Ack, ack.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  That looks like poorly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Whenever Steve yawns, it looks like the back of the Batmobile in a Dexonix.  Pockitosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers. 
[02:15:00]  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Ooh.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:15:30]  Burr.  Welcome to the second half of the Opie and Anthony program, the Opie and Anthony show,  the ONA virus, exclusively on XM Satellite Radio.  Hi.  The girls are outside wondering what to do.  They were ditched.  They're just standing outside wondering what to do.  How many times have they probably ditched guys?  We ditched them. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, God.  It just...  Yes.  I don't know.  We just left them in the dust, standing out there looking stupid.  I just...  I don't know.  I can't be bothered, but I'm just amazed by the stupidity all around us.  And this isn't a slam on XM or anybody else today.  It's a slam on the people that wanted to promote The Omen.  Right.  Like, why wouldn't you have, A, hotter girls, B, girls that you force them to wear bikinis, 
[02:16:30]  smaller bikinis, not the bikini tops with their jeans on.  They suck things.  And C, why wouldn't you have 666 across their bodies in the biggest letters possible?  Huge red letters on the stomach, on the back, maybe on...  I thought the girls were good looking.  I think for bikini girls walking, they would have been getting plenty of attention.  But you have a big 666 on the thigh of one of them to make people look.  What the fuck was that? 
[02:17:00]  I don't know.  Would a smoothie make you feel better?  No, I hate smoothies.  I want a smoothie.  It would make me feel better.  Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  I actually fuck smoothies.  I want a big fruit juice.  Maybe Sam could go...  Are they standing outside wondering what they're doing?  I don't care.  I hope they are.  Because we...  I don't know.  The whole...  Well, you're going to have to find it.  You're going to have to find it.  Am I...  The one girl had it on her big toe.  It was...  It was done.  It was fucking...  It's on your vulva.  I'll check with my finger.  Is it under your clit hood?  How am I going to find it?  I don't have the fucking Hubble telescope, but I can't touch you. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, way to promote The Omen, where you'd have to literally get an inch away from their skin  to see the 666, and they're not going to allow you to do that.  It's not like they're letting you do it.  Why bother?  You know what they are?  They're actual size from, like, the movie when they pulled away Damien's hair, and it  was the tiniest little 666.  It's that on a sticker on one girl's toenail.  That stunk.  And now we have to do extra radio, because we couldn't kill time on the street. 
[02:18:00]  How about this?  Fucking get a big 666 and put it on her stomach, and people will look, and then you go,  it's The Omen, it's coming out tomorrow.  That's how you promote it.  Scary.  Woo.  Hey, let's go to a...  Six girls with a fucking carefully hidden thing have to find it.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, giggle, giggle.  Yeah, do I?  Is it in your cunt?  Then I'm not interested in looking, stupid.  Let's get a market filling.  Either hide it in your asshole or under your clit hood.  Well, let me at least search.  Let me at least search and put clear stuff on it. 
[02:18:30]  Fucking annoying.  Hey, those 6 girls, we can have a real butter bing party.  Yeah, could we?  The old butter bing.  Mark in Philly, what's up?  Oh, and hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, the best part of that walk was when Opie walked into the wall, you clumsy ass.  Yeah, you walked right into a wall.  Hold on, I mean, you can call me a clumsy ass if you like.  That's fine, but I'll tell you why it happened.  I was so annoyed that I needed to just get away from them and get in the building as fast  as I could, and I was turned around and... 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, turned around looking at them.  I was turned around looking at them and yelling at them.  What you hear is not me, you know, being a coward and saying that in a corner.  I yell at people to their face, and so I'm yelling at them, and I didn't realize that  the wall was right behind me, and I turned back around and went, bam, into the wall.  Well, if you guys can, would you be able to play that back?  Because that came across the air so funny.  All right, yeah.  I'm pissing myself.  All right, we'll try to find that.  Thanks, Brian.  You guys suck.  All right.  Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't know what happened with women and this radio show, but 
[02:19:30]  it just is the same shit.  That was awful, especially when I saw them show up downstairs in their jeans.  Look, if it was snowing, but you're being paid to walk in bikinis, lead something to the  imaginative.  Shut up!  And that all starts with one girl.  One girl that just wasn't comfortable with the bikini thing decided, ah, I'm just going  to put my jeans on, and then everyone has to fall suit and go, oh, my God, thank God,  that's a good idea, because I got the start of a stretch mark, and I got to cover it up. 
[02:20:00]  Oh.  I got to cover it up.  Are they right out there?  Where are they?  Are they in the hall?  Oh, why don't we bring them in and ask them how it went?  Well, just keep them outside there for a second.  Turn the volume down out here, too, Hawk.  One, two, three.  Huh.  What?  Come on.  Huh?  Uh.  Yeah, I knew it.  I knew that one.  You know.  Oh, wow.  Ah, all my good lines got dumped out of!  Why would they F another M in the, oh, my God, they dumped out of the abbreviation. 
[02:20:30]  These fucking...  That means...  You got juiced in your face?  That means no one got a chance to see that I'm actually funny.  You got juiced in your face?  All right, let's get...  How can you not say that?  I don't know.  Let's get into the dump report.  Yeah.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Here it is.  Your dumps for June 5th.  6-0-9 for Christmas, you fucking idiot. 
[02:21:00]  That was Norton quoting a line from The Sopranos, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  But we warned him and that should have been dumped because, you know, it's holiday-centric.  Yeah.  Uh, 7-15 a.m.  It's a little odd.  I love this line, too.  Ovaries dry up and roll out of you.  It's not sexual at all.  It sure conjures up an image.  Opie, during discussion of old woman going through menopause...  See, guys, that could be funny.  See?  It was surrounded by references to wearing diapers and wetting yourself.  It's the roll-out-of-you part that's the problem. 
[02:21:30]  But nothing's being inserted.  We're taking something out.  It's not sexual.  If you recall, I made an ovary prune line and that was it because it wasn't rolling out of her.  Because I guess they assume, where are they going to roll out of?  Her ears.  Can I be honest with you, Anthony?  Yeah.  Because I do listen to you.  Should that have been dumped out of?  That one?  No, I don't think it should have.  No.  So either.  No.  I don't think so either.  No.  But you seem to be a little more on top of me.  No, I don't think it should have been. 
[02:22:00]  These days.  Because, quite frankly, I don't give a shit.  7-55, you just made me piss myself.  Okay, fine.  I can't say that.  8-11, you can't F another man in the A and get cancer.  How does that get dumped out of?  Jesus fucking Christ.  Thank God for XM.  I think the letter thing, what we were told by the lawyers is, you could say F, you know,  go F yourself. 
[02:22:30]  But you can't start using it in terms like this.  You can't F another man in the A.  That then turns it into more of a detailed story.  But here's the bottom line.  You're supposed to be doing that stuff in case children hear it.  That fucking children aren't going to be able to decipher that, you dumb cunts.  No, you're dumb C's.  C.  Well, that they'll know, because even kids know what a cunt is.  Oh.  8-46 a.m.  You got juiced in your face.  How is that dumped out of? 
[02:23:00]  How is that fucking dumped?  Can you not reference anything sexual?  It says, uh, yeah.  Yeah, you can't.  Holy shit.  You really can't.  Radio sucks.  During a news story on an OJ sex tape, it is graphic in this context.  It's not.  So, uh.  Ugh.  Yeah.  And again, Opie repeating the line, you got juiced in your face.  How about you got a little MoMA on your cheeky poos?  Hey, I'm in the early.  Dumped.  I'm in the early lead this week.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Wow.  That's too bad.  I loved my ovaries line.  I was very proud.  That shit would have been dumped out of.  I started looking around like, oh, that's right.  It, uh.  Don't say anything racist.  That'll get dumped out of.  Yeah.  The XM people are very happy they heard it.  They heard it.  Well, that's why you got the XM.  There you go.  Chicks were fucking horrid.  Yeah, let's give the chicks a talking to.  They're not here.  What happened to them?  Oh.  Of course.  Maybe because we all walked in the building and left them outside.  We were running in front of them.  Good.  We were running a good 10 feet in front of them. 
[02:24:00]  How many of them actually said, oh, my God, this has never happened to me?  Yeah, beat it, stupid guy.  Oh, my God, they're, like, running away from us.  Oh, my God, this has never happened to me.  How about this?  We were happy to promote the old man.  What happened, Ben?  They left.  Good.  How was the promotion?  Well, they said on Friday when they set this up, they were going to hand out posters,  movie passes, have the girls dressed in the outfits, T-shirts.  Who ran that whole operation?  Who ran that?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Well, how do we not know?  I want to know.  I want to question the person and go, dude.  What were you thinking? 
[02:24:30]  It's none of our guys' fault.  No, no, no, no.  I know it's not.  I know it's not our guys.  I guess I'm saying, who was the guy?  It's just, I mean, they should have thought out the promotion better.  I mean, they said it sounded a lot better.  You know, there's a great opportunity for these people, and they just don't get it.  Who, does anybody know how to do promotion?  We're happy to help promote the omen.  Why?  Because I'd like to see it.  I'd like to see it tomorrow.  6-6-0-6.  I'm scared.  Hot chicks.  Scary.  I had to throw a little makeup on them, a little devil makeup.  Of course.  They have horns on, maybe. 
[02:25:00]  Whatever.  It's corny, but people will look.  Fucking five chicks with bikini tops, blue jeans.  How about an overcoat and a Russian hat, like they're going with Saturday Paul Castellano?  How about that?  Maybe they could all march in front of Spark Steakhouse.  We have a 6-6-6 underneath our winter boots.  That fucking dumbness.  When she said, you're going to have to find it, I just turned around and started walking  across the street.  I don't play that game.  And then that stupid, you got to leave something to the imagination. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, do I, Mae West?  A-hubba-hubba.  A-hubba-hubba-hubba.  23 skidoo.  Nothing is to be left of the imagination.  And then the one girl showed that the 6-6-6 was on her big toe, and we were supposed to react  to that.  Any of you guys have a foot fetish?  Uh-oh.  Oh!  It's getting saucy in here!  Oh!  How about this?  No!  How about this?  None of us do.  I have a severed head fetish. 
[02:26:00]  Exactly.  You want to make that happen, too?  I have a meaty cunt fetish.  Where's the 6s?  That's right.  They just don't.  Girls don't get it.  Of course they don't.  And people got to get our show, too.  They're playing right into our hands there.  Four strippers, you get four hot, fuck strippers, actresses, fucking strippers make me sick.  Anybody who will put on a fucking bikini and do the job they've been told to do, you put  big 6s on them, you put devil horns on them, maybe they carry omen signs, and you know 
[02:26:30]  what, I don't know, 57th street rush hour in the morning, people look.  She's like, people are going to stop an ass.  Who's going to stop 6 chicks?  By the way, do you have the mark of the devil on you with no signs?  No one.  And I knew that they had it, and I wouldn't look for it.  Of course not.  Fucking atrocious idea.  The best is when I said there were 6 girls in the studio with bikinis and 5 were hot.  They all started looking around trying to figure out who the ugly one was.  Holy shit.  They were looking around.  And they all thought it wasn't them. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, it was horrible.  Gotta leave something to the...  Yeah, do I really?  Leave something to the imagination every time you jerk off.  When you got real girls around, you don't want to leave things to the imagination.  Taking goddamn clothes off.  That's right.  God, that annoy me.  I want to talk to the guy who brought them in and go, what was that?  Sir, if you don't mind, what was that?  You know what, though, man? 
[02:27:30]  I mean, it's cold out.  I don't want anybody catching cold.  I have to walk with a jacket.  I'm still kind of chilly, so I really don't blame anybody for...  You know how fucking whores?  Just cock-tease and cock-tease and cock-tease.  They make me sick to my fucking stomach.  But I don't like being sick.  So I take echinacea and I drink juice.  And the girls won't get sick either.  Why?  Because they're dressing responsibly.  Like most cunts do.  Cock-tease and then dress responsibly.  The 70 to the imagination.  I'm imagining my dick burying your asshole.  Is that enough?  The imagination is a fine thing, though.  Is it playing?  I can't tell.  My mood just picked up for no reason. 
[02:28:00]  Wow.  All right, I'm running out of stuff, so I'll just keep snapping and hoping that song ends  quickly so I can get back to trashing these fucking whores.  Holy shit.  They just don't understand.  How about you get...  No, you can't.  No movie would allow you to do that.  What?  Get six guys with Down syndrome to walk by and hold up signs, but nobody would go for that.  I don't blame them.  Why is this fucking awful, mealy fucking...  God, is Bill the only one who can find a fucking healthy orange in this city?  Where do the rest of the guys go?  Do they find homeless guys' bags and rifle through them? 
[02:28:30]  Look, in honor of the anniversary of AIDS, I figure they give you a fruit that didn't look  too good.  An orange with AIDS.  The only guy that can do it is fucking Bill.  I sent him out for juice.  That one retard.  I sent him out for lactate.  But he brings back a fucking coffee beans.  What?  Fuck.  Bill, you say, I'd like some juice, and I'd like this, and I'd like that, and it's all  gotten.  Bill is the man.  Oh, how titillating.  I have a 666 on me. 
[02:29:00]  Use your imagination.  Don't get so saucy, you.  Where do I start?  Is it on the fanny?  T-A-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I.  You think of that bitch?  Oh, God.  The only thing time that would be interesting is if it was on Pat from Muunnaki's toe, and he 
[02:29:30]  held it up and showed you.  That's my blood sugar count, too.  and my weight  wow  so now we have to do extra radio  thanks ladies  oh that played into everything we hate about women on the radio  everything  well what do you want me to do  how about shutting up  how about that 
[02:30:00]  what are you going to do for us today  what do you want us to do  unless they come in and their first words are  can I fuck myself with that bat  we don't want to see them  who's good on radio  Mary Carey is good on radio  why  because she gets it  she throws other chicks under the bus  she's funny and she talks about fucking black guys  yeah  I like her  and she'll show her tits  there you go  alright in honor of the 25th anniversary of AIDS  we got Stephen Lynch  I don't think we've ever played this on XM 
[02:30:30]  what is it  Stephen Lynch's FBA  actually co-written  co-written by Jay Moore  Mike DiNicola  is Mike still doing comedy  I haven't seen Mike in a while  I bumped into him walking maybe eight months ago  I don't know where he's at  yeah  used to be a friend of the show  we haven't heard from him in a while  Stephen Lynch  so he's in studio  and Jay Moore and Mike DiNicola  they all decided to write an AIDS song  yeah  this was written in literally five minutes  five minutes  and you can tell  oh I know  I don't think it really stands up 
[02:31:00]  hmm  no  that's alright  and then what we got is the live version  when 2,000 of our listeners  were singing the song all together  but here's Stephen Lynch in studio  doing FBA  alright this is called  what is this called again  authors of the song  Jay what's this called  it's called  full blown AIDS  down to my target weight  sarcoma has popped out  all over my face  I lost three teeth  and all my friends  looks like I'm nearing the end 
[02:31:30]  no use telling a lie  or even a fib  when you're lying in bed  counting all your ribs  you try to give blood  but you showed me the door  well I went to stand up  and I fell on the floor  it's full blown  damn that whore  damn that whore 
[02:32:00]  I said damn that whore  damn that whore  Jay and Mike  just reading what they wrote  in front of me  there you go  so Stephen Lynch  yeah actually  backpedaling  he was backpedaling  I don't think  yeah I don't think  he did write it  that was good  I think Jay and Mike  wrote it down  and said sing this  and Stephen Lynch  I remember we had a whole thing that day  where we finally convinced him  to sing the song 
[02:32:30]  guy's a god damn  Tony Award nominee  can't be singing those songs  he can really sing to that list  you know what everybody  everybody on Broadway is  talented  talented  yeah  that's right  and under 150  I say  we play that one tomorrow  on the 92.3 show  and that's why  there's not as many  Broadway hits these days  right  anyway  so the song  took on a life of its own  and we did one of these  O&A road shows  and  and the song went out  and raped somebody 
[02:33:00]  life of its own  because if everything  takes off  on a life of its own  than is jotting  something down  believe the  bombs and  flubs  feature that  prominently  anyway  the song took on  a life of its own  and raped somebody  we did a road show 
[02:33:30]  and he went up there  to sing his FBA song  that was heard on the radio  a lot by this point  and listened to the crowd  really get into the  singing of FBA  and I think there was a little  talking part that was added  a little  a little  right there  this was Spike  was there too  I don't know  I don't remember  but here it is  I don't usually do cover songs  but this one  this one's very special to me  so I brought the  one of the co-authors of FBA  Mike DiNicolo 
[02:34:00]  Mike DiNicolo  Mike has been kind enough  to write a little  extension to the song  so if you listen closely  you might hear some things  you haven't heard before  down to my target weight  sarcoma popped out  all over my face  I lost three teeth  and all of my friends  looks like this time  I'm nearing the end  full blown eggs 
[02:34:30]  don't need to lie  no reason to fear  when you're flat on your back  counting all your ribs  I went to give blood  they just showed me the door  I stood up to leave  and I fell on the floor  full blown eggs  everybody now  damn that whore  damn that whore  I said 
[02:35:00]  damn that whore  yeah  damn that whore  let's break it down now  Mike DiNicolo  is going to do  a little spoken word  a little poetry  because I know you guys  can appreciate  some good poetry  right?  well the FBA  has set in  and he's left  feeling a little low  here you go Mike  well  now I've got AIDS  I don't feel so good

[02:56:00]  said something  I didn't know  if I could even  be heard  it's a little  hard to talk  at 80 miles  an hour  Patty I'm  trying to  concentrate on  the road  you know  was she at  least talking  about interesting  subject matter  absolutely not  oh look  there's a license  plate from  Wyoming  someone's saying  that they hope  Patty's motorcycle  ride ends up  like Heather  Mills last ride  oh that's not  fair  that's not fair  no  it's called  not funny  no  so you were  having a good 
[02:56:30]  time on the run  yeah I had a  great time  I enjoy riding  on motorcycles  I don't get that  much time  you know  I don't do things  vibrating on your  on your pussy  is that what you  like  I didn't know  on your cougar  whatever the fuck  you call it  after menopause  how's that menopause  working out for you  you all dried up  down there  I don't even know  if I am going  through it or not  I have never had  a gynecology exam  to even know  she's never  went to a gyno 
[02:57:00]  my next medical  you're not gonna  go for  why don't you  go for a gyno  exam  have a pap smear  somebody tried  that on me  once  and it didn't  even go through  because I just  couldn't take it  I was screaming  and they had to  not do it at all  was it an uncle  and you were  eight  it was a shoehorn  no  let's take a look  it just for some  reason it scared me  how old were you  it was just only  about two months ago  wait wait wait  hold on  two fucking months

[03:03:00]  oh wait  Howie Mandel's on the phone  now I'm gonna tell you  alright Howie Mandel  a whore would do  stuff like that  oh howie Mandel  hold on a minute  Howie Mandel  only has 10 minutes  so you sit there  you sit there  and get ready  Howie  yes  I'm Howie Mandel  everybody  I'm not a porn person  we follow the  washing the box out  routine  yeah you gotta follow  the washing the box out  we'll explain  another day  we had Howie Mandel  in studio  Howie we had a  great great time  with you  this was a few months  back 
[03:03:30]  and you told one of  the greatest stories ever  and we play it all the time  on our channel here  on XM  and I think at the time  you were promoting  Deal or No Deal  and I gotta be honest  with you  I'm like yeah whatever  I am so hooked  on Deal or No Deal  and I'll tell you why  it's because of  Howie Mandel  well thank you  because the show  I'm how he's fan he is  I go to just about  every show he's on  who is that  that has to pee  what is that  fill me in  it's stalker Patty  she's a real life stalker  we met her  when we first came  to New York  about 8 years ago  she's now 51 years old 
[03:04:00]  her birthday was yesterday  she is a virgin  she was raised  so strictly religious  that she  is so  ashamed  with her body  and sex  and everything  that she's  she sounds ashamed  she really does  sound ashamed  so now we've  we've just had it  at this point  we've had it  she's talking about  saving herself for what  what is she saving herself for  exactly  tell her  the old age knows  what about someone  you're really  really in love with  you're 51  you're saving yourself  your uncle junior 
[03:04:30]  at the home  what  you're saving yourself  for the actual act  of fornication  I want people to see me  as nice  they do see you as nice  a nice virgin  who has to pee  what  have you done  any other  have you done  other things  no I don't dare  she doesn't dare  do you know  Howie is a germ freak  and he gets into  some dirty action  Howie's  how is he germ  yeah but that's how  people get AIDS  and stuff like that  I don't want to go  from that 
[03:05:00]  I don't want those  problems  do you date  do you date  well I just joined  a dating service  oh my god  write that down  want to know  it's www.jure.com  but the problem is  everybody wants  somebody that's  30 years old  even people my age  they don't want  someone my age  and I don't meet  their age requirements  yes  so lie about your age  to be honest with you  as I would do  as the host of  Deal or No Deal  at this point  I'll just give you  some advice  like I would  for one of the cases  open your legs 
[03:05:30]  yeah but what  do people think  of me  obviously  you know like  I would on the show  you know obviously  in the room there  we have one box  left unopened  it's Patty's  it could change  your life  will you open  the box  well why don't  people  will I get  respect afterwards  will people see me  as one of those  well I'm not sending  you out in the world  to you know I know  that's a very honorable  what you're doing  and it's  are you in the clergy  no 
[03:06:00]  howie  she's never had  an exam  she went  here's the problem  months ago  and I got  passed out  from the pain  she passed out  she said it to us  you've never had  like a pap smear  or anything  no  because I don't  know I went  once when I was  20 years old  and had such a  horrible experience  I never went  back again  you know what  I don't know you  but you're stupid  she's as dumb  as they come  that's exactly  what we say  it's one thing  to save yourself  but not  that's ridiculous  that you're not  getting checked 
[03:06:30]  she went to the  gyno like a couple  of weeks ago  she said  and screamed  and passed out  when they went  with the little  speculum  or whatever  they call it  it's a speculum  you had to put in there  I'm not a doctor  but I played one  on TV  yes you did  you're being ridiculous  wouldn't you laugh  if you were playing  a doctor  on St. Elsewhere  and this woman  came in  and it was part  of this show  that she screamed  and passed out  and she's a 51  year old virgin  because she was  getting a gyno exam  wouldn't the entire  staff laugh  and that would be  a comedic moment  it wasn't to me 
[03:07:00]  it was to everyone else  but your pain  is entertaining  to other people  you realize that  yeah exactly  so now we got  a little thing  you have these  fears and everything  do you see  are you in therapy  am I in therapy  no  you should  you should  yeah  but I'm not crazy  you should put yourself  checked  so how are you  I mean we got a  we got a little  sex toy in studio  we got some KY  and some very thin  and some gloves  and condoms  and we're figuring  today's the day  she needs something  in there  she's got to ease  into it 
[03:07:30]  and just get something  in there  so she can at least  go to the doctor  yeah you should go  to the doctor  you know what you  should do  I was thinking  of marketing  for the other area  like a singing mammogram  I think would be  easier for people  do you think that  would be good  where they just  come over to your  house  with the equipment  and they can tell  by the echo  also gynecologist  I would imagine  that could be  a very threatening  and fearful thing  for a woman  to at least  the first time  I don't know  about a 51 year old  but to have her legs  up in the stirrup  and be  if I was a gynecologist 
[03:08:00]  what I would do  is I would try  to put you at ease  I would be more  entertaining  I would learn magic  I would be a magician  slash gynecologist  and maybe  you know  start pulling that  never ending  handkerchief  out of your vagina  it starts turning  and then you laugh  when the big bloomers  come out  yes  and all that  and then at the end  like a rabbit  a good one  so you know  whether you're pregnant  or not  a rabbit holding  its nose  what about a mild  sedative  pardon me  what about a sedative 
[03:08:30]  that'll make me  a little numb  so that they  it's called a roofie  for a pap smear  right  hammer to the head  yeah she needs  to be put out  so anything  could be put inside  there  no it's just  that you know  oh we've been  dealing with  it was uncomfortable  it was so uncomfortable  that I  I think you're lying  there is no way  you're 51 years old  and you haven't even  had a gynecologist  I am  and I never have  yeah Howie  we really do believe  her unfortunately  this is not something  you should be promoting  on the radio  this woman is totally wrong  this is 
[03:09:00]  aren't you afraid  of the possibilities  the negative possibilities  of uh  yeah  my health habits  are very healthy  I don't smoke  I don't drink  I don't take drugs  I eat little vegetables  I know  you could just get something  I take care of myself  well you don't  you don't get examined  you don't take care of yourself  no  you don't  that's what I'm taking  care of yourself  you're gonna get  the big casino  with a cervix  even a healthy lawn  has things  that will grow on it  you don't use tampons  I did 
[03:09:30]  when I was getting periods  I did  oh now she doesn't get them  oh yeah we forgot to tell you  Howie  still a virgin  and now she's going  through menopause  yeah but they say  my levels are way too high  for that  so they can't explain it  well that's why she gets  checked out  I don't really understand  what's happening  I know  I don't need  she's talking about levels  of hormones  my hormones  we get her a date  on the air  you can't get her a date  we've tried hooking her up  with this other big fat  mess of a guy 
[03:10:00]  she touched Ron Jeremy's  cock once  and I touched her nipple  and Jim Noren  touched her nipple  why didn't you  you're not a virgin  why didn't you kiss Andrew  no a virgin  is somebody  who's never had sex  why didn't you kiss him  she went on a date  why wouldn't you  kiss the guy at night  because he has  really bad breath  oh sorry  I don't know  so you're not  interested in dating  you don't get  I want to date  I really want to  do you not get horny  yeah she masturbates  to you too  we learned that 
[03:10:30]  oh you do  and with what  but she  I guess  I guess there's no  penetration  yeah she just  she just  kind of rubs  she hangs out  on the outside  she probably rubs  like her  her big hips  like and it just goes  oh  she works  is she there  can she answer  yeah  Patty tell her  Patty answer  what  do you put  do you put  your finger in  you masturbate  no  how do you do it  how do you do it  oh now I'm in there  tell him 
[03:11:00]  how do you do it  it's fun to find out  where your line of  embarrassment is  it's an open and  honest show Patty  how do you do it  what do people  think of me  don't worry  I used to be taught  that people would  hate me  they already do  oh my god  you know like  my foster parents  used to tell me  what would their  friends think  you know  oh screw them  they're dead  I know they are  but that's still  with me after all  these years  don't worry about it  think of me  even though I  try to ignore  that  let me know 
[03:11:30]  if I'm right  Patty answer  in a different  voice so people  won't think  any less of you  do you think  if she could  use a different  voice she would  be using that  one  do you think  right now  answer my  question in a  different voice  so they won't  think it's  Patty that's  answering  when you  masturbate  what do you  use  I just  just say it  Patty  I just  use my  finger  which finger  you don't  put your  finger in  but you do  put your  finger in  on your  panties  you don't 
[03:12:00]  you don't  take your  panties off  when you  masturbate  you haven't  even got  the third  base with  yourself  yeah but  I'm not a  bad person  oh my god  that's not  bad  it's something  so natural  that everyone  does  you're bad  by not doing  it  you're an  evil bad  stupid  ridiculous  person  that's right  dumb  guilty  for not  doing it  for not  getting checked  medically  right  well a couple  of times  I wanted to  but couldn't 
[03:12:30]  because I  didn't have  insurance  and then when  I did  masturbate  I tried  oh the  doctor  so what  you play  with what  your little  clitoris  through your  panties  through your  panties  you stay  on the outside  oh god  I guess  that's what  you call it  her clit  is on her  outside  maybe she  should go  to a doctor  do you wash  yourself there  yes I do  in the shower  everybody does  oh okay  now how thoroughly  do you wash  yourself down  there  probably not 
[03:13:00]  very thorough  because you're  afraid you might  friggin slip  well  when's the last  time you washed  your vagina  last night  in the shower  every night  when I take  my shower  what just  the outside  were you wearing  heavy  no  she's wearing  a bathing suit  she wears clothes  in the shower  yeah that'd be  silly  did it feel good  what  did it feel good  does it feel good  when you wash  yourself down there  oh I just felt  clean because I'm  washing myself  but while you're  doing  here's my point  the finale of 
[03:13:30]  Deal or No Deal  is on tonight  on NBC  5 million dollar  finale  segue into a promo  I don't know  how to do that  but this is good  the woman washes  her vagina  and I have a finale  tonight  5 million dollars  5 million dollar  finale  5 million dollars  in one box  on my show  she's never put  anything in her box  look at that  I really do love  Deal or No Deal  did anyone win  the million dollars  well tonight  you gotta watch  there's a good chance 
[03:14:00]  somebody has picked  a 1 million dollar  case but they  ended up taking  a deal  they lost the faith  I saw that show  it was amazing  tonight with 5 million  dollars in one case  the offers can go  way above a million  so the money is  oh ok  so the  oh wow  so someone can  pick a case  that has 5 million  dollars in it  tonight  what they can  pick 5 million  2 and a half  million or 1 million  3 out of 26 cases  have at least  a million dollars  how cool is that  I actually watch  the show sometimes  I'm in the gym  on the bike  and the volume's  off but they have  like the readout  and it's so annoying  I'm done with my ride 
[03:14:30]  and I actually  have to stay  and watch the  end of the show  to watch this guy  talking to his dumb  family and I'm  still interested  I'm telling you  too I don't think  this show would  work as well  if they didn't  have Howie  I mean Howie  you keep it  really entertaining  with the contestants  look at you  look what you're doing  with your contestants  and you're the king  of making people  way through commercials  you build it up  and go  we're going to put  a finger  in the cafe  right after this  exactly  Howie  yes  you know about  on E!  that show

[03:43:00]  yeah what does it mean  what do you mean sweaty  it has to smell like something  like  I don't know  like what  I can't describe it  of course you can  I don't have words  yeah no you don't  by the way  what are we celebrating today  AIDS Day  AIDS Day  that's why he's here  he's been HIV positive  for 10 years  you just touched the guy's balls  that actually has AIDS  congratulations  I hope that I don't have  so many cuts on your hands  welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS 
[03:43:30]  that should be okay  good  thanks a lot for coming in man  I appreciate it  that guy was cool  good luck with the AIDS man  can I get my Purell out of my pocket  no no  it doesn't cure AIDS  that doesn't even help you  well I want to wash my hands  you can wait a minute  it's too late  you might have a little on you now  that's what that sweaty smell is  it AIDS  don't touch your eyes  yeah it's through the sweat glands  you idiot  yeah don't touch your eyes  it's alright  well maybe not  the guys  I tell you  you did loosen his bag up though  yeah  I think  you're like an old bag loosener 
[03:44:00]  from way back  you're a pro  no one will believe  that's the first bag  you've ever loosened  Patty did that make you feel  in any way  did you feel like a thrill  sexually  in any way  anyway  be honest  I don't think so  you don't think so  no because it was  kind of weird  now I'm afraid  I have AIDS  relax  a lot of times  you don't get it that way  can't wait until  Drew Boogie's next remix  on Patty 
[03:44:30]  she said some great shit  she's gonna have a great promo  a lot of times  people don't get AIDS  that way  yeah  it's only sometimes  honestly to be fair  it's like 1 in 50  something like that  so you know  don't even worry about it  no no it's more than that  because she rubbed under the balls  she actually did a rub between the balls  and that's where AIDS is known to collect  do you get liquid on your hand  but she got sweat  you could smell it on your hand  that's what that was  sweaty  that's where it comes to the gland  sweaty  yeah I would really like to use some Purell  that won't matter  that'll actually make it worse  yeah Purell actually makes AIDS stronger  the reason it makes it worse 
[03:45:00]  is because  listen to me  it closes your pores up  which keeps anything from evaporating out  trust me  that's what it does  that's why it's bad for you in the long run  if you got something like that  you gotta leave it  because if you put Purell on your hands  it will close the pores  and that means anything  that would have evaporated off your fingers  will not evaporate off your fingers  that's why you don't use it  yeah Jim speaks the truth  yes  that's how it works  what about soap and water  by the way  by the way all the Starbucks muffins  are gonna smell like onion  no  they're just soaking there  I didn't order an onion muffin  no they're not

[04:27:00]  And she seemed like she was coming down from a nice...  I was watching the whole thing on Pal Talk, it's easier to see.  And you can definitely tell that something happened right there.  Yeah, she's feeling it right now.  I can't catch my breath.  I'm still out of breath, I can't even move.  Do you need your inhaler?  I don't...  I don't...  I don't think so.  They're all applauding and clowning.  I'm not having an asthma attack, that's...  They're applauding, they're laughing.

That's gonna become your new best friend.  That is, yeah.  And now we're gonna see Patty again.  Screwtrue.com, there you go, there's your boyfriend.  Let's all start chanting whore.  Whore, whore, no.  Whore!  Whore!  Whore!  Whore!  Whore!  Whore! 
[04:28:00]  Whore!  Whore!  Whore!  Whore!  Whore!  Whore!  Whore!  And now you're gonna do that.  You know what, I give...  Nah, we can't do it here.  I give Patty a lot of credit today.  That was great.  Wow, Paddy.  Excellent.  Do you think she had one?  Yeah, or it came really close.  I mean, again, it's going to be a bill.  She might have to be alone.  That's a lot of tension.  Do you have tissues?  Oh, well.  She knows the jargon and everything.  Now all she's going to say is get out.  All right, let's go to the phones real fast.  Dave in Tennessee.  Dave. 
[04:28:30]  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I was going to call in to say it sounded like you found another piece of trainable audio,  but that ended up being kind of dementedly hot.  All right, very nice.  Yeah, it was interesting.  Mike O'Longano, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  This is eight years in the making.  I want to say congratulations.  Yeah, see, they're congratulations, Paddy.  Way to go, boys.  Good job.  All right, Chris in Pennsylvania.  Well over 850 people in the room, by the way.  Palatog room.  Are they really? 
[04:29:00]  Yeah.  Chris?  Dang, one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  Yep.  And I got a hard on.  All right, Scott.  I filled up at one point, too.  That was kind of sexy, Paddy.  Scott?  Nice.  Hey, man, I'll tell you what.  I had to pull my damn truck on the shoulder of the road, man.  You guys did a hell of a job, man.  I love listening to you.  Thank you, Scott.  What about the job I did?  Yeah, exactly.  We didn't do anything.  I'm the one that had to do it.  What about Howie in New York City?  Howie?  It's a Smithsonian called and says they want the vibrator. 
[04:29:30]  Who?  The Smithsonian.  Smithsonian.  Ike has something to say.  Ike?  You.  Yo.  I just want to say, Paddy, make yourself feel better.  Just say no hetero.  No hetero.  Good job, Paddy.  Good job.  Talon the trucker.  Talon.  Good morning, guys.  Congratulations, Paddy.  No, I've seen it.  What would happen if she turned into a nymphomaniac and would call you guys every morning with  the gory details?  Yeah, everyone's just like, fuck in.  Yeah, but she finally realized all she wanted was uncut black dick. 
[04:30:00]  And she became a size queen in two weeks.  A size queen?  It was too small.  Oh, I like a lot more girth.  A cock hog.  Well, the other night I was doing a DP with a couple of guys I picked up at the bar.  Is Ron and Fez here?  This is going to be big news on the Ron and Fez show today.  I'll tell you that much.  You got to keep...  Give it all...  Here, Paddy, keep this too, in case you need it.  Here.  Put the KY...  Yeah, take the KY.  We'll get some more. 
[04:30:30]  You don't need the gloves.  Yeah, you don't need the gloves.  Use your own hand.  Use your own hand.  God.  What?  This is going to get...  Throw it right there.  It's only lube.  Go ahead.  Throw your dirty whore towel away.  Dirty whore towel.  Oh, shit.  Do I get a Nino?  Yeah.  You can explain that to God.  You can tell God why you just did that.  So it felt good, though, right, Paddy? 
[04:31:00]  It just felt different.  I never felt anything like that before.  But the more you do it, the more it goes from feeling different to feeling really good and  occupying all of your life.  Yeah.  That's why you're supposed to do it when you're younger.  You're supposed to start out because you got plenty of free time on your hand.  You'll be in front of your computer before you know it.  And a lot of gooey stuff.  Blowing off friends and family.  Yeah.  I'm busy.  Not being able to work out because you just can't stop jerking off.  I got things to do. 
[04:31:30]  Allowing it to ruin your life.  You'll be there.  Being late for the cellar.  Jimmy?  Jim?  Thanks.  What?  You okay?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just telling Patty it's good that she's doing that.  All right, Patty.  That was wonderful.  Well, Patty.  Happy birthday.  See, we gave you the greatest birthday gift ever and you thought we didn't like you.  That's right.  Now you go home and do that as much as humanly possible.  Next thing you know, you'll be spending all your money on it.  No.  Questioning if you're a faggot or not.  I think at the end of the month I'll take myself on a little bus excursion to Atlantic 
[04:32:00]  City and see the Borgata for the first time.  Why did you come there when I was working?  Well, that'll do it.  Well, please throw yourself off the roof.  I can't go whenever I want.  Here's the honesty of the show coming in.  Seamus, yes?  Hey, I've been out for three weeks on the road, dude.  How in the hell am I going to explain to my wife that I just whacked my bag listening  to Patty?  Oh, that was too hard.  Patty, guys were jerking off to you.  Holy shit.  Guys were jerking off listening to you. 
[04:32:30]  Doug in Pittsburgh.  Doug.  Hey, Patty, that is tremendous, guys.  That is the best piece of radio I've ever heard.  I'm in a steel mill and I'm supposed to be in an outage meeting and I'm sitting in a car  listening to this.  The best piece of radio ever.  I wish I was where you were supposed to be instead of here, sir.  Let's go to Paul in Westchester.  Paul.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I just wanted to congratulate Patty and say that we finally have some respect for you  out here.  Yeah. 
[04:33:00]  There you go.  See?  You earned respect.  A nice lady wouldn't have done that, though.  Marlon from Brooklyn.  Marlon.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Yo, Jimmy had a real fucking creepy, soothing sound in his voice like he was Gary Glitter trying  to talk to seven-year-olds.  Well, you know what?  No, I know, dude, but it's like you want to, like, I jerk off enough to know, like,  it's hard to concentrate.  She's nervous.  She's going, it's okay.  Just be mellow.  You want someone mellow.  You don't want excitement.  You know, it's hard with guys yelling, do it, play with it, stick it in.  I can imagine just sitting there and jacking off with everybody cheering on.  I certainly could. 
[04:33:30]  I want Stalker Patty coming as my ringtone for text messages.  Is that the new one?  Oh.  Oh.  You do collect ringtones.  Good job.  Derek in Dallas.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Derek?  I just wanted to ask Jimmy there if that was one of those scheduled rapes from Friday's  show.  Scheduled.  I just tweaked Patty's nipples a little.  It was nice, right?  I didn't do them rough.  Someone had a really, really funny Photoshop on Wackbag. 
[04:34:00]  That had to be the best show you guys have done in a long time.  Thanks.  They had a lady in a business suit and she's looking at her watch because she had a scheduled  rape.  Did I say scheduled rape?  Did I say it?  Oh.  Or, yeah.  No, I don't remember the exact line.  Something like unscheduled.  Or, yeah, something.  Or surprise.  I think it said something about it.  Oh, yeah.  It was the schedule.  Oh, I didn't remember.  Whatever the line was.  I'm sorry.  Neil and Buffalo.  No, I don't remember either line either way.  Neil.  Hey, guys.  You want to say hi to the dirty girl? 
[04:34:30]  This is the best bonus time ever.  Oh, look at that.  Thank you.  All right, Neil.  Anybody else want to talk to Mary Magdalene?  Amazes me.  After so many years, Patty, you can still somehow bring a surprise to the program.  She really is amazing.  Yeah, we're just about done with you.  I filled up a little bit.  How much else do you do?  I got a little bit.  Did you fill up?  Dude, not full.  Sam, do you have to fill my cock?  You fucking homoerotic, raceless creep.  And he put away the company camcorder and brought out his own. 
[04:35:00]  That's right.  It's not even on.  He just wants to get a better look at it.  I got to zoom in.  Do you?  Louis Anderson voice.  Rub my cock on fucking E-Roc's do.  That fucking awful rug you're wearing.  Stinks.  Rug.  Here, Amon.  I don't mean to laugh at you.  I don't mean to laugh at you.  We got to get you.  Fucking Amon Gertwig.  Stinks.  I don't mean to laugh at you, but the front part of your hair does look like it's how  those commercials go. 
[04:35:30]  It's like coming up.  It looks like it should be in front of Caesar's Palace with Evel Knievel jumping over it.  Hey, Ralph Fiennes, punch this website up for me.  Fucking do makes me sick.  You're killing my heart on E-Roc.  Look at that.  Go ahead.  Oh, God.  Film that, you fruit.  Get off of that fucking duck.  My God, man.  You want to hold my rod?  You want to touch it?  I thought I did that once before.  Just touch it through the pants. 
[04:36:00]  It's no big deal.  Go ahead.  Yeah, through the pants.  Why?  Jeb.  Why?  Through the pants.  Right there.  There you go.  That other side.  No, there.  She goes.  You want that, right?  See, that's usually what takes place of the dildo there, Pat.  See?  And there's no work for you.  You could just lay there and be unconscious.  We're trying to get out of here, but the phones are ridiculous. 
[04:36:30]  Will in Denver.  Hey, Patty.  Yeah?  Yeah, Jesus was watching you, Patty, and now Jesus hates you, you heathen.  He starts laughing when he says, Jesus was watching you.  Hey, Will, can I get a snowcat there?  Hey, Robin in Jersey.  I just wanted to tell Patty that was hot.  She can wrap that up in a box, because that was radio gold.  Yeah.  Look at that.  The lady's checking in. 
[04:37:00]  Look at that.  That was hot.  All right.  The lady checking in.  The lady.  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Yeah, man.  It's only Monday, and you've already blown your wad.  What are we going to do for the rest of the week?  Oh, we just coast now.  We figure it out.  Tomorrow we have a devil theme.  Well, you know what?  Thanks for the bonus time, and you absolutely get to coast in my book.  Thank you.  Well, people will leak clear stuff.  I got a rod, says Tim in New York.  Hey, guys, what do you say tomorrow we all wear red horns?  Oh, for 666 day.  How about we don't? 
[04:37:30]  How about we don't is right.  Okay.  We'll be the only devil.  Thank you, Patty.  By the way, that was all free.  We did that for free.  Oh, right.  Bonus time.  That was bonus time.  Well, thank you, Patty.  That was great.  Good job.  Well done.  Little did you know that was going to be happening when you came in.  No, I didn't expect that, but there's always a surprise.  It certainly is. 
[04:38:00]  All right.  All those years, you've been missing out on that.  Yeah.  Make sure you keep batteries in that little fella.  You want extra batteries?  Extra batteries.  All right, give her a few extra batteries.  That's right.  Diggingly not included.  Included.  You know how bad while she was doing that, I just wanted to put my hog by her face and  see what happens.  Did you?  See if she just turns around and goes, oh, grabs it like a pro.  And then she, like, pulls me in by the balls, fingers my ass with one hand while she's fucking  diddling her clit with the other. 
[04:38:30]  Takes me balls deep into her throat with her fucking glasses, mushed up against my appendix  scar.  You look like clear.  My fat gut in her face.  Fuck it.  It's like she's crooking me like the hello thing.  That's how she hooks my asshole and just pulls me in.  Come, Heather, luck.  Come, Heather, luck.  Oh, crap.  Well, a lot of the girls were really into it.  Angela in Florida. 
[04:39:00]  You can come hold my vibrator.  Angela?  So hot.  What's that?  I said he is so hot with her screaming and it made me miss my vibrator.  I forgot to pack it.  I was like, oh, I just want Jimmy's voice going, it's okay.  Oh, see, people are digging Jimmy, actually.  No, the woman's voice in the background, even though she's got that fucked up accent.  It's a Staten Island accent.  No, that's a fucking alien accent.  Why, miss, did you not like me whispering to Patty?  I had to. 
[04:39:30]  Oh, no, I like that.  I liked it.  I want you to whisper to me when I'm trying to come.  Well, yeah.  Whisper to me.  Come slowly, Angela.  Come slowly.  Myspace slash Jim Norton.  You see, whatever the girl's like, I found extremely creepy.  But you see, because it's to relax her.  Like, you can't.  Just you, you see.  Yeah.  Calm down, Patty.  Yeah, you can't ask her questions like they were asking her questions.  That's so hard.  How are you sleepy now?  You've got to really think about it.  And saying things like, there, there, jam it.  Jam it in your hole.  There, stop.  No, no.  Don't think of me.  Stop.  More, more. 
[04:40:00]  I'm just trying to, like, get the fucking mechanics of it down.  You took care of the psychological part of it.  Yeah.  I was purely, you know, fucking tab A in slot B.  Do it right, stupid.  You like the old nips being rubbed, right?  That feels good.  That's what gets me off.  See, Patty didn't think that was contributing at all at first.  And then she started really getting...  Her nipples were hard.  And I was licking my thumb and touching your nipple.  And that's why it was so smooth.  She is going to be such a fiend now.  Oh, yeah.  Y'all ruined it for any guy.  She's all about cock now.  Patty is all about cock. 
[04:40:30]  What's that?  She's actually going to get a t-shirt that says cock or bust.  All right.  Thank you, Angela.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Fuck.  All right.  We've done enough.  Yeah, we did it.  We got to do an interview or something, don't we?  Oh, yeah.  We were supposed to do that at 11.15.  Eric, do you know who your hairdo looks like?  No, no.  Go there again.  What?  The Hawaiian punch creature.  He just had the sprouts, like, out of his head. 
[04:41:00]  Just the front part.  How about a nice Hawaiian punch?  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, have a fruity beverage, you Nazi.  Ah, shit.  It's still crawling in.  Oh, they love it, Patty.  They love it, Patty.  It was a hit.  Yeah.  They loved it.  It was a hit.  We're going to do it live one day at a road show. 
[04:41:30]  Exactly.  On a pitcher's mound.  While a bunch of African circle jerk on you.  Well, Bobby Bigrigger has something.  He's always good for one.  Bobby.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Bobby.  What's up, man?  Everybody.  Today's bonus time was sponsored by Patty's First Orgasm.  That's right.  Adam in North Carolina.  Adam.  Hey, boys.  How funny would it be if Patty turned into a cock-loving slut and then she ended up getting  Abe and died?  I wouldn't want to see her get Abe, too. 
[04:42:00]  Hederically funny.  I want to see her get warts just because that's confusing.  Why are the Frankenstein things there?  That's all right.  What is this?  No, she's fine.  Let's go to Jane on Long Island.  Jane?  Yeah.  Jimmy, why don't you just go down on her while you were giving it?  I mean, really, anyone can stand on the vibrance.  I'll tell you why.  Just go down on the girl.  I'll tell you why.  Give her the full experience.  Because she had, A, there was gook all over it from the lubricant, and B, she didn't  want me to.  Maybe someday I will. 
[04:42:30]  Well, really, think about it.  Do you get...  The offer's on the table.  She has a nice little clit.  Did you put her fingers up there, too, to really help it along?  No, I would have rubbed her clit, though.  Give the girl the whole experience.  I would have.  I tend to be creepy when I put my fingers in.  I put my tongue between my teeth and they go, meh, meh, meh.  Well, you should have done that.  She could really, really come.  I mean, right now, she may have come, but you don't even exactly know that.  But really, because it's been a whole world now.  Right.  You were so gentle on the boobs, you might as well have been just gentle on there, too. 
[04:43:00]  You could have gone the whole way.  I'm very gentle on the bosom.  Thank you, Lynn Samuels.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  And I think for the finale, we should...  Program complete. </pre>
