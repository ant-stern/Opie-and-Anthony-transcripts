<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the NYPD's swift and efficient clearing of Zuccotti Park, the Occupy Wall Street encampment.  The hosts, along with caller Buck Sexton of TheBlaze.com, analyzed the operation, contrasting before-and-after photos of the park and discussing the protesters' relocation attempts and the mayor's conditions for their return.  The segment included mockery of the protesters' lack of preparedness and the health hazards of the encampment. This was interspersed with discussions about the new Muppets movie (including a phone interview with Jason Segel, who later appeared in-studio), Chaz Bono's upcoming interview and documentary, Herman Cain's struggling presidential campaign (featuring a mockingly played clip), Jerry Sandusky's contentious Bob Costas interview (with multiple clips played and graphic commentary), and the fate of the Occupy Wall Street library.  The hosts also engaged in a humorous discussion of SWAT team stereotypes. Profanity and sexually suggestive humor permeated the entire segment.

The Jerry Sandusky/Bob Costas interview remained a central focus, with repeated playing of clips and increasingly vulgar commentary from the hosts and co-hosts.  Jason Segel's in-studio appearance provided a counterpoint, detailing the production of the Muppets movie, his interactions with Mickey Rooney, and the challenges of using traditional puppetry.  Larry King briefly appeared outside the studio, greeting the hosts.

The show continued with a lengthy conversation with Larry King, who recounted various anecdotes: a CNN prank involving the CIA and the Muppets, his experiences with Jim Henson and Steve Whitmire on *The Muppet Show*, his unusual interactions with Marlon Brando (including a car ride, lunch, a kiss, and a controversial interview leading to a visit with Rabbi Weir), and his new stand-up career.  This segment also included a Radio Shack tech support call, further discussion and clips from the Jerry Sandusky interview, an update on the Occupy Wall Street situation, discussion of the NBA lockout, and extensive promotion of the Opie and Anthony Thanksgiving show, which would include a play about the first Thanksgiving.  Many guests and personalities were mentioned, including Jim Henson, Steve Whitmire, Marlon Brando, Sean Penn, Carl Malden, Rod Steiger, Al Pacino, Adam Sandler, Gloria Allred, Ben Stein, Bob Costas, Chaz Bono, Mick Foley, The Rock, and several unnamed recurring co-hosts (Jimmy, Bobo, Kurt Love, Eastside Dave, Sam Roberts).  The segment was rife with profanity and vulgarity.

A segment featuring a discussion about creating a fictional ultra-violent basketball league, the XBA, transitioned into commentary on Chaz Bono's documentary and a scathing critique of an Oprah-produced ELO documentary.  This segued into speculation about Howard Stern's potential role on "America's Got Talent," and a phone call with Ed Asner, who repeatedly insulted Anthony, culminating in him saying "fuck you."  The hosts then played a clip of Asner and discussed MTV's depiction of sex reassignment surgeries with graphic descriptions.  Chaz Bonoâ€™s arrival in-studio led to an interview covering their relationship with their girlfriend (who struggled with alcoholism), past drug addiction, transition experience, family reactions (especially Cher's), surgical details, sexual orientation, and navigating public life.  The segment ended with Chaz Bono still in studio.

The Chaz Bono interview continued, focusing on *Dancing with the Stars*, their transition, adjusting to life as a man, the hardest mannerisms to change, past sexual experiences, and orgasms before and after transition.  Bono explained their changed sexual orientation.  The hosts asked numerous explicit questions. Post-interview, the hosts, Jim Norton, and Sam Roberts discussed Bono's appearance, the interview's absurdity, manscaping, and the merits of hairy versus shaved genitalia.  This transitioned to discussions of boxing judging, Don King, Jim Norton's comedy shows and website, and razor burn.  Larry the Cable Guy then arrived to promote a Prilosec OTC tailgate contest.

The final segment featured Larry the Cable Guy, who discussed the Prilosec Super Bowl ticket contest, humorous anecdotes (childhood discipline involving Life Savers, a generous tip incident at Waffle House, a carpet fire, and a powerful fart), his thoughts on Occupy Wall Street, his career trajectory, and his "Get Her Done Foundation." He also promoted Argentium jewelry using the ironically humorous website IHateStevenSinger.com.  The show ended with plugs for the contest, social media, and sponsors, including Trojan condoms, interspersed with further crude jokes and banter.

[00:04:00]  Good morning. 
[00:04:30]  Hi, people.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello, human beings.  You know what I love about radio?  What do you love about this medium?  I spend a lot of time telling everyone what I hate about radio, but I'll tell you one thing I love about radio.  You go to bed.  Wow, by the way, the microphones sound amazing.  Did you do something?  Uh-oh.  Did you tweak some shit?  Damn, that's a good microphone.  Anyway, you go to bed.  You wake up.  And all hell breaks loose, and you get to talk about it.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  That's what I really do love about radio, right there.  It is good, because when I hopped in the truck and turned the radio on, and I got 1010 Winds on there, the news station, I was like, all right, now we got something.  You know, it's almost like Christmas.  Yeah.  You turn on the radio, and you're like, oh, what do we got today?  And today we got a doozy.  We got Occupy My Balls.  Occupy Wall Street is pretty much no more in New York City.  It's done.  Zuccotti Park was cleared out in the middle of the night.  1.30 in the morning. 
[00:05:30]  I just tweeted a picture of a very, very clean park.  It's spick and span, as they say.  Wow.  I also tweeted the picture of our front page today, because yesterday, I guess, man, this woman that decided to hang out just completely naked at Zuccotti Park, like, look, we can do whatever we want.  Whatever.  Yeah, sure.  It's on the front page.  A girl completely nude, including the bottom, by the way.  Where's that?  You don't?  It's on the front page of the paper.  Wait, wait.  On that one?  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  I got in a little later than usual.  Oh.  Oh, there she is.  Holy shit.  Did you just say, where's that?  Yeah, because I saw clean it up with the cop, but from this angle, I couldn't see it.  Yeah, the girl is completely naked, and she was just kind of hanging out on the edge of the park with her arms up in the air, and there's a cop in the photo, like,  you can't do nothing, it's our park.  God.  Little did she know, you know, the NYPD had a big plan that was about to go down.  You gotta love the NYPD, man. 
[00:06:30]  They had a plan, they had overwhelming numbers, and they had leadership, and they went in there, it wasn't this willy-nilly, fire-fucking-tear-gas-and-beat-people-over-the-heads.  They knew exactly what to do.  Take the people, they cordoned off little groups of them.  Yeah.  And escorted them out of the park.  Yes.  And then told them to keep moving, keep moving.  And the second they stopped to try to, like, regroup somewhere else, they split them up even further, told them to keep moving, keep moving. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  You gotta keep these people moving along, and then they just disperse.  Well, they-  It's amazing.  They formed a human chain at one point.  Yeah.  The protesters sat down and formed a human chain.  How'd that work out for them?  And they started, like, chanting, no violence, that's what they want from us.  No violence?  And, uh, basically, the mayor's saying, once again, they're allowed back in, but without tents.  And they mean without tents this time.  No sleeping bags.  No sleeping bags.  So this-  They could just come in.  This thing is fucking over.  You know what?  The cold weather moving in, no tents. 
[00:07:30]  They're just gonna be sitting on this rock bench.  Right.  And freezing their fucking, uh, balls off.  Wow.  But there's the picture I just tweeted.  I mean, I've been down there a shitload, and to see this picture, I'm just amazed.  It is-  It is clean as a whistle.  They were taking a chainsaw to the newly built, uh, tent structures.  Was that the tent for the women that were sexually assaulted?  Yeah.  Or so they don't get sexually assaulted?  Yeah.  First aid tent also.  Yeah.  And then they took a-  Everybody was bitching. 
[00:08:00]  I love the people, they were like, you- they- they did a sneak attack with no advance  notice.  Like, yeah.  Well, that's how they were gonna do it.  Yeah.  That's how you do it.  The- when they gave advance notice last time, they had to call it off because the press  was there waiting-  Right.  For, uh, a confrontation.  That's what the- the city blew it last time.  But you knew they were just gonna, you know, sit back and wait.  Waited out, and then at 1.30 in the morning with no notice to anybody, they went in,  uh, took all the tents, sleeping bags, everything else, piled it up in a big dumpster,  uh, hauled it over to Midtown somewhere, where people were told they could pick up their 
[00:08:30]  possessions.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because they just left- they told everyone, leave your shit, and get the fuck out.  Nope.  Of the park.  Oh, wow.  Nothing- nothing worse than seeing your- your shit in a pile somewhere.  Big pile of shit.  And, uh, yeah, they told them that.  They- they told them they could come back, but without the sleeping bags and tents.  They tried to regroup in a- a couple of the other nearby parks, and the cops immediately  got to them, dispersed them.  They're not giving them a chance to get another foothold again.  Uh, this thing's over.  When are they allowed to come back? 
[00:09:00]  Uh, they didn't tell them when.  I think, uh, they're just gonna open up like, uh, like the park normally was, but you guarantee  there's gonna be cops there.  Yeah.  And the second somebody tries to, uh, start something again, they're just gonna be removed  from the park.  As soon as they see someone with a tent?  With anything, they're gonna tell them, get out, you're not taking this park over again.  It's kind of a bummer, man.  I liked going down there and just checking it out.  Eh, it's gotta end.  But the word came out yesterday that the mayors across, uh, the country were trying  to shut it down as a whole.  Yeah.  So I don't know what's going on in the other cities, but here in New York, which was pretty 
[00:09:30]  much the head of the movement, they fucking just cleared them the fuck out overnight.  It just goes to show you that.  How long did it take, do you know?  A few hours.  A couple hours?  Yeah, they're still kind of dispersing people, they're walking down Broadway, and they're  keeping them moving, they're keeping them off the roads, onto the sidewalks, and then  trying to get them, like I said, into smaller and smaller groups.  Right.  And then they just disperse them.  The NYPD is, uh, amazing.  Really smart, man.  You gotta give them the credit they deserve for being able to break up a group like that 
[00:10:00]  without the tear gas and the fires and the violence, because they did it with as much  courtesy as they could while you're breaking up a group of people.  Well, what happens to the people's library?  Uh, that's probably, uh, thrown in a giant fucking dumpster.  I think that's in the dumpster.  Oh, God.  I'm concerned about the people's library.  I could only hope it's in a dumpster.  Dumb, they're dumb books.  Not even good books.  So what happens now?  A can't be a fruit. 
[00:10:30]  What the fuck happens now?  Now, uh, you know, they're getting into smaller groups and brainstorming as to what their  next step should be.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, and, uh, I don't see what they could do, because this, this was a, uh,  weird circumstance, because the park itself was a privately owned park.  Right.  And any publicly owned park, the police can just go in immediately and kick them out.  Wow.  They didn't see this coming.  No, they didn't see it coming at all.  And the police had a good reason, because they said a lot of the tents were, uh, tents  within tents. 
[00:11:00]  People had illegal heaters in there that were a carbon monoxide threat.  People also had candles burning inside these tents, which is a fire hazard.  Um, health hazards were going on, uh, with, uh, defecation.  And, um, just having that many people living on top of each other like that spreads all  kinds of shit.  Well, they had Zuccotti Lung.  Zuccotti Lung.  Zuccotti Lung was taken over the park, so.  I think it's great.  I think, uh, you know, kudos to the NYPD for a job well done.  I don't think it's great.  I mean. 
[00:11:30]  I think it's great.  It was fun to go down there, man.  I think it's great.  Check out the drum circle.  Check out some freaks.  Ugh, the drum circle.  Have some, have some free Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  Ugh.  Being dished out by a hippie.  Disgusting hippie with ice cream on his arm.  And then, of course, when you felt like it, you go to the People's Library and you do  a little reading.  The People's Library.  The Rock came back last night, I heard.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We don't have to talk about it.  You talk about that when you're wrestling.  Did he smell something?  Oh, yeah.  I bet he did.  Yeah.  Have a little circle over there and you wrestling guys could talk about that. 
[00:12:00]  We got real shit to talk about today, Sam.  Real shit.  Oh, the Zuccaris.  We're out of Zuccaris.  Ah, my mother needs to make some new Zuccaris.  We got Cassius.  Cassius.  I flew back.  What?  This story is fucking changing by the minute, Ann.  Go ahead, Cassius.  Yeah, you guys maybe got to put it on public radio or something, but they're already saying  that they've already occupied, they're starting to occupy Foley Square.  Yes, that's what I heard, sir, but I also heard that the police are en masse around Foley 
[00:12:30]  Square and they are dispersing that crowd also.  They're not letting anybody get another foothold.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, you know, they have said that.  Well, how do you know they're occupying Foley Square?  Are you there?  No, no, no.  This was just on public radio just a few minutes ago.  Well, they are.  Ah, you can't trust public radio.  Public radio says one thing.  Anyone that has a delivery like that, you should be suspicious of.  I heard John Montone, who was there, and said that hundreds of police were already coming 
[00:13:00]  into the area of Foley Square and telling people to leave.  Where's Foley Square?  Foley?  Achmel?  Achwel?  Where the hell is Foley Square?  Foley Square?  Do you know?  It's close to Zuccaris.  Where is it?  Where is it, Cassius?  It's up by the court area, like the Supreme Court area.  Oh, okay.  I know about where it is.  North.  Sure, sure, sure.  Above City Hall.  Well, what are they going to do without tents?  Freeze their fucking disgusting dirty balls off. 
[00:13:30]  Not today, though.  It's going to be like 70 today.  I know.  It's going to be very, very nice.  Well, you know that they've got right under a quarter of a million dollars in their fund  from donations.  Yeah, good.  Spend it on fucking rent.  Yeah.  Rent out some fucking place for a week in Manhattan with that.  If I was the guy whose bank account that was, I would just split.  I would just fucking leave.  I would just close my account and then just tiptoe backwards out of the New York City area.  Occupy fucking Atlantis. 
[00:14:00]  That's what I would do.  That's right.  Occupy the fucking blackjack table.  That's right.  With that money.  That's fucking right, man.  Occupy fucking...  Occupy number 36 on the roulette wheel.  Can I use this as the Batman signal today?  Ooh, bat signal.  Stunt Brain's been texting me and he's now writing me back.  He asked if we want a guy that was down there when the whole fucking thing was going down.  I said yes.  I would like to hear firsthand information.  So if Stunt Brain's listening, yes.  Have the guy call immediately.  What about our intern?  People love when he talks about this. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, fucking Matt.  Oh, God.  Was he there?  Did he go?  Supposedly he came back.  He's a ghoul, man.  He's just a fucking ghoul.  He sucks.  I heard some shit from fucking Dave's party that's just like...  Really?  I heard something bad, too.  He's a fucking asshole.  Really?  He really is a fucking asshole.  Yeah, that's...  God.  I don't really need to talk about Matt right now.  I do want to hear if he was down there, though.  Was he?  Yes.  Yeah.  Today, when they got busted? 
[00:15:00]  Real Phil Hendry on Twitter writes,  Truth is, Occupy Wall Street, if it was in a Batman movie...  Yeah.  And they are filming some of the Batman movies down there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Batman would beat every last one of their asses, and we'd be cheering.  Batman.  That would be great.  Watch Batman fucking swing in there and just start beating the fuck out of everybody.  Takes his batmobile.  On the news right now, they're tearing apart.  Huh?  On the news, they're showing it.  They're pulling the tents apart.  Oh, oh.  Are we in that montage of...  I saw...  Are we in Outer Space? 
[00:15:30]  Oh, look!  There we are!  Yeah!  Motherfucker!  Oh, I didn't even see that.  What happened?  I wasn't even looking at that.  Look, it's a Sirius ad, and all the logos are floating in space.  Did we...  There we are!  I saw us again!  Was it Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony channel.  All right.  Thank you.  Motherfucker!  Thank you, Sirius XM.  Bravo!  Thank you.  Thank you, Sirius XM.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Sirius XM.  Pizza party for everyone.  Nice!  Yes!  Get rolling on that shit immediately.  I would love pizza.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Does anyone have Stunt Brain's fucking phone number?  Will you call him?  He's not picking up.  That's great.  He starts this.  He's like, hey, you want the guy?  Stunt Brain's got to sleep.  Huh?  Stunt Brain got to sleep?  He was texting me ten minutes ago!  That's why he's been up.  Exactly.  He's a newsman now.  It's crazy.  So, Zuccotti Park is clean as a whistle.  That's it.  They're behind on TV.  That's the picture right there.  There is not a fucking tent to be seen.  And it looks like they already swept it up nice.  They power washed it. 
[00:16:30]  They already power washed it.  Yeah, they power washed it.  They scrubbed down all the benches and took all that shit off of the sidewalks.  Right.  Yeah.  They cleaned it up.  And now they're not letting people back in there to make another eyesore.  Where are the drums from the drum circle?  Because maybe I could pick up a nice barn goat.  Unless you took it with you, it is in the fucking pile of shit that they said can be claimed  somewhere in Midtown.  Ah, shit.  I think people are going to have to sort through just a pile of shit. 
[00:17:00]  They're not going to separate all this stuff.  You don't think they're going to separate a sleeping bag?  Oh, God, that gnat and fucking flea and tick and fucking chinch bug.  I bet there's bed bugs too, right?  I bet there's chiggers in it.  I hate the chiggers.  What are they?  Oh, chiggers?  Yeah.  They're a horrible parasite that feeds off of healthy people.  It just takes, takes, takes, takes.  I hate chiggers.  I've heard of them, but I don't think I've ever encountered one.  Oh, they're all over the place. 
[00:17:30]  Are they bed bugs or no?  No, that's a chigger right there.  Look at it.  You fucking.  It looks kind of like a tick, a bed bug.  Yes.  And a crab.  It's a parasite.  They're all combined into one.  It does nothing but sucks the blood of the fucking people.  You parasite chigger.  Well, what are we going to do?  I want this guy from, uh, from the blaze to talk about Occupy Wall Street.  I just talked to Mike.  He said that guy's going to call in about 10 minutes.  All right, that's fair. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, you spoke with Mike.  All right, because we're really busy today, because we got Jason Segel, who's from the  Muppets movie, of course.  We got Larry King.  We got Chaz Bono.  Is he a Muppet?  Uh, he's not a Muppet.  What does he do?  Is he the producer, director?  What does he do?  He stars in the Muppets.  What does he do?  He produces the Muppets.  I believe he pretty much did everything, because no one wanted to touch the Muppets, and Jason  said, I'll take this project on.  Is it a, it's a reboot, isn't it?  It's a reboot.  It's a Muppet reboot.  I liked it.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's going to be a family movie, but I liked it. 
[00:18:30]  I heard there were some pretty funny jokes in there, like adult-themed jokes.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That's always fun.  And they mock, like, those typical Hollywood things that movies do.  Yeah, yeah.  Which I thought was really, really smart.  That's good.  It's PG.  It's not even a G rating.  It's PG.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We are the Muppets.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Me, me.  And these are our biggest fans.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You excited for our big trip to L.A.?  There's somebody coming. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, excuse me.  Good grief.  Disney presents.  Just a pause.  Pause for a second.  You guys are so talented.  Jason's brother in the movie, Jason Segel's brother in the movie, is a Muppet character.  But he's not a Muppet, you see.  He grew up very different from everyone else.  Oh.  And then he found people just like him, and that would be the Muppets.  Oh, okay.  So his obsession, he had an obsession with the Muppets, and then they finally went to Hollywood 
[00:19:30]  to go to the Muppets Park, or whatever it's called.  Muppet Studios.  And then Muppet Studios, which we learn is closed because no one gives a fuck about the  Muppets, which was pretty funny.  That is funny.  And then it all comes together, obviously, and that's why you go and see this movie.  Is that his brother there?  Yeah, that's Jason Segel's brother.  That's not a human.  Yeah, I know.  It's a sock.  I know.  So how is that?  You kind of had to believe in some things.  Oh, did you?  I don't want to believe in Muppets. 
[00:20:00]  You have to.  You have to believe.  Why is E-Rock wearing a red dress?  Bart shoes.  Oh, okay.  The biggest event in Hollywood history.  The Muppets Spectacular!  Yay!  That is awesome!  There's just one problem.  I'm going to shoot straight.  You guys aren't famous anymore.  Yeesh.  I wish she'd shot a little more curvy.  Let's just start at the bottom and work our way back up to the top.  Can't you see I'm busy?  Come on, guys.  Let's go!  Step one. 
[00:20:30]  Are you one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?  Yes, I am.  Tour the world.  We should travel by map.  To Paris!  Step two.  Rehearse the show.  I'm doing a duet with my new dance partner.  Hola.  Let's try that lift again, shall we?  Hey, the lift again.  Okay, on my count this time, okay?  In three, two, ready!  Is this worth doing? 
[00:21:00]  Quite.  I don't know.  I believe in you, and you, and you, and all of you.  Aw.  I'm not either.  And now, singing chickens.  Huh?  I'm not sure either.  Yeah, I mean, bed?  Huh?  No.  This is not my style of movie, but it actually looks all right.  Yeah, I saw it.  I saw it yesterday.  It's definitely all right, man.  Yeah.  It's definitely all right.  I think it's, like you said, it's going to do, like, amazingly well.  Yeah.  In the box office.  Yeah.  And, you know, Jack Black's in the movie, so.  Fuck.  What happened?  That's what?  Oh.  What happened, guys?  What's he doing?  Hey, guys, what happened?  Guys. 
[00:21:30]  Oh.  Guys, what happened?  But I like the movie.  Guys.  What's he doing in it?  Is he making wacky eyebrows?  And over-the-top talking?  Guys, what happened?  We're discussing the Muppets.  And all of a sudden, it turned.  Jack Black.  They need a celebrity host for their telethon.  Oh, boy.  It's a small part.  And they kidnapped Jack Black.  He's in the whole second reel, as they like to say in the business.  Oh, boy.  He's in the second reel. 
[00:22:00]  Why wouldn't he be?  He's terrific.  The best part of the Muppets.  I really did enjoy the movie.  And Jason Segel will be in here.  Yeah.  There is a whistling scene in this movie.  And my and the show's obsession with Steve the Whistler.  Steve the Whistler.  I'm thinking, holy fuck, he finally got called by Hollywood.  So I sat.  I never sit through credits ever.  And unless he changed his fucking name or he has another name out there, they did not use Steve the Whistler for the big whistling scene. 
[00:22:30]  Well, contrary to popular belief, there are other whistlers out there.  Steve the Whistler was the grand champion, if you remember.  He's cream of the crop of the whistlers.  Yeah, he's won international competitions, Anthony.  I can't whistle.  I've always wanted to.  That's from the odd couple.  When was the last time?  When was the last time we played Steve the Whistler?  Can we play it again today?  Please. 
[00:23:00]  Can we?  How do you do it?  We can't.  How do you do it?  Yeah, we can.  Yeah.  Can you whistle?  I can't whistle.  Dude, my whole life, it's been the bane of my existence.  I can't fucking whistle.  Wow.  I don't know what to do.  That's it.  Can't do it.  Is I doing it?  No, you're just going...  Why am I just blowing air? 
[00:23:30]  Who's air?  I was in that room.  I fucking stink.  This was an over-the-top whistling scene.  I'm like, it has to be Steve the Whistler.  It has to be.  And I don't think it was.  Hey, we got Buck Sexton on the line.  Buck Sexton.  Wow, that's a porno name.  Buck, you're a contributor for TheBlaze.com, right?  That is correct.  And you know stunt brains, so I apologize for that.  He's awesome.  He is the awesomest. 
[00:24:00]  We like to stunt brain.  You were down there?  I was indeed, yeah.  I got down there.  I was on my couch.  I was actually researching all this sort of crazy Marxist end-the-world community organizer stuff.  And I looked over, and there was a tweet, and it was like calling all cars for the far left.  Like, we're under attack.  And I went down there to check it out.  Under attack.  What time was this at, sir?  I got down there around 1 a.m.  I'm sorry, around 1.45.  I think they started the arrest around 1, so it was about a half hour, 45 minutes after they started. 
[00:24:30]  You know, they walked through, and they handed out flyers.  This is what people told me when I got down there, these very, very angry protesters.  They handed out flyers and said, you know, get out or you're going downtown.  Well, you know, further downtown, whatever.  And they didn't go, so they started a series of arrests, and then some other guys who weren't arrested were sort of gathering around.  I mean, they looked like a bunch of kids who couldn't find their parents in the mall.  That's great.  You know, we can't stay here. 
[00:25:00]  I thought Mayor Bloomberg said it was okay.  Well, apparently not.  So, you know, there was some of that.  And then, you know, they tried to rally in a few different points.  And, you know, the cops were just kind of a step ahead of them the whole way.  I heard the delusional fucking, they're so delusional thinking that, you know, hey, this isn't fair.  No fair.  You're an idiot.  You had to know that the NYPD had something up their sleeve.  I heard that they sat down at one point and formed a human chain. 
[00:25:30]  Were you down there for that?  Yeah, they were talking about it.  I mean, what ended up happening was at one point sort of the whole cluster of, like, you know, the guys left behind that weren't picked up.  And they were discussing, you know, what are we going to do next?  And they said, well, we're going to form, well, first we have to break up because there's police informants among us or whatever.  Oh, informants.  Yeah, I was looking around.  I was like, I don't think so.  But it's not really necessary when there are 400 police, like, circling you.  Yeah, you don't need them incognito.  Right.  So, anyway, they basically said, you know, we're going to break up into these, like, direct action working groups or, you know, whatever they call it, like, little committees. 
[00:26:00]  And the little committee that I sort of walked off and was just listening to, they're like, we're going to form a human chain and we're going to go right at the police.  And then there was one guy, maybe he just kind of thought that they're a little better than the rest.  He's like, I don't think I want to do that.  Yeah, no shit.  And so they backed up.  I think one of the groups did try that.  And there certainly was at one point on one of the corners, they were, like, just yelling all this stuff at the cops. 
[00:26:30]  And then a few of them ended up, you know, getting face planted on the squad car and, you know, screaming about how, like, they didn't do anything.  Yeah.  They didn't do anything.  I mean, some of these guys, I saw them, you know, 10 minutes before, an hour before, whatever it was, screaming.  I mean, just all kinds of, like, crazy profanity and what they want to do with the cops and their family.  It was just, like, crazy.  Oh, brother.  And then when they finally, you know, they don't, they're in the street.  They've been told not to get in the street.  You know, it's disorderly, whatever. 
[00:27:00]  They get the flex cuff thrown on them and, you know, they start complaining and saying it's so unfair.  Unbelievable.  Unfair.  But describe the whole scene.  Like, did they have trucks down there and they were throwing everything, all the tents and the people's library into the trucks?  Or how would they, how did they do it?  Because I just saw a picture where this park is spotless now.  Yeah, what they did is they, you know, by the time I got there, they had already cordoned off the park.  So I couldn't get to the park. 
[00:27:30]  They were just, and so all the remaining sort of protesters were about a block away.  And there were groups of, you know, NYPD with SWAC gear on at each intersection, essentially, around Zuccotti.  So you couldn't even get, you literally couldn't get closer than a block to it.  Yeah, they were very organized.  Yeah.  And so, you know, they had all kinds of trucks and, you know, ESU gear and everything.  Everything was down there.  How many cops were there?  I'm fine to guess.  Hundreds, right?  Yeah, I was going to say 150, maybe 200. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, they said about 200 cops.  Yeah.  So, you know, they're all over the place.  It was kind of funny, too, to see the, you know, the occupiers were like, everybody, like, go to Broadway.  It's like, I think they've got Broadway covered, guys.  Yeah.  We kept sort of, like, walking back and forth, like, we're going to sneak around them.  It's like, well, it's a park.  There are four corners.  And they have all four corners covered.  So I don't think we're going to, you know, fool them.  But anyway.  Wow, they've got to be just bummed out today, man.  They really thought that was their park. 
[00:28:30]  I think so.  They dug in pretty good, too.  Oh, man, I saw the medical tent.  It looked like something out of MASH.  I mean, it was a serious, you know, it looked like, you know, like the big green military.  Right, with the big red cross on it.  How could they think that was going to go on for long?  Like, how could you think you were just going to build tents in lower Manhattan and get away with it?  Watching some arrests on TV.  That's a good one.  I think maybe at some point they decided that if they just sort of kept going this way, maybe they could force sort of the end conclusion.  You know, they could force that last apocalyptic, you know, fighting against the man to their own terms. 
[00:29:00]  Guess that didn't pan out.  Didn't pan out.  No, the NYPD decided that it was going to go down on their terms.  Yeah.  Hey, Buck, you've been following this very closely.  What happens now?  What happens to the movement now with this going down?  B-D-B-D.  Hey, Buck.  Well, here's the thing.  You know, they were planning, and I think it honestly played a pretty big role.  I mean, it was this and also, of course, all the sort of like sexual assaults and, you know, the lice and the Zuccotti lung and all that crap that's been going on down there. 
[00:29:30]  But they also said that they were going to have this two-month commemoration of their occupation down on Thursday.  They were going to shut down Wall Street.  That was part of what I didn't really understand what that meant because they can't even get to Wall Street because obviously it's been closed off.  Right.  But they were planning to mess with the subway system, you know, jam up the subway system, probably just, you know, link arms, human chain, whatever, you know, have people lie down on the steps. 
[00:30:00]  I mean, there's a thousand, like, you know, stupid ways to do this.  Yeah, so people that want to go to work are inconvenienced by these booms.  You can imagine how much that would slow up.  I mean, if you just did that in, you know, four or five major stations downtown, I mean, it would just be complete gridlock.  Yeah.  But in terms of going forward after that, I mean, they're already talking.  I mean, they were talking tonight about, you know, are they going to move to, like, they said Union Square.  And I was like, I don't know if that's going to work out for you guys.  You know, they're talking about, you know, Tompkins Square Park, which, you know, it's a slightly more friendly audience that way. 
[00:30:30]  A lot of them are just kind of walking around now, right?  They have nowhere to go.  They have nowhere to go.  It's kind of like kicking an anthill.  Yeah.  They're all over the place now trying to figure out, do we rebuild this thing somewhere else?  It's a long way from Hampshire College, man.  Yeah.  And honestly, you know, the NYPD is not going to allow any other park to be occupied now that they made their move.  No, especially not a public park.  This was a private park, so they had a little bit of an issue going in there and kicking the people out. 
[00:31:00]  But if they want to go into a public city park, then they have no leg to stand on.  The cops are going and take them out immediately.  Well, let's not forget they're allowed to go back, but obviously without anything.  Yeah, it's going to be good to sit there shivering on a bench.  Right, so, I mean, it really ends the movement down at Zuccotti Park.  Yeah, I mean, they had planned last week, and they were planning this on Veterans Day, which also gives you a sense of their sensibilities.  They were going to do this, like, Flower Child Revival Festival in Central Park. 
[00:31:30]  Groovy.  And then there was talk about occupying Central Park, but that totally faded away, because I think whoever their sort of liaison is, or whoever the department officer is that deals with them, he came through and said that, you know, this is not happening.  Yeah, you will be arrested.  But that's what a real protest is.  You don't wait for permission.  If you guys have balls and you're going to protest, you go take over Central Park and fucking make them take it back from you.  The city would never allow them to take over Central Park. 
[00:32:00]  They wouldn't even allow them to take a part of it.  But that's just it.  They would have had to have tried and gotten their heads bashed in and, you know, started some shit, whatever.  But it just goes to show you, they really were all talk, these guys.  I went down to Foley Square when they couldn't do the Central Park thing, and I talked to a few.  There were a few, like, definitely aging hippies, I mean, guys that, you know, they were psyched that this was their chance for the revival.  And all they could talk about was what a bunch of wimps all the other protesters are for not to do. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, getting arrested in Central Park was pretty funny.  I can't be arrested.  What did my parents say?  Good job, Buck.  What do we got?  You're on The Blaze today?  Yep.  Theblaze.com, you got an article on there?  It's about to go up, yeah.  And what's your Twitter for the people that want more?  Buck Sexton.  Buck Sexton.  And Buck Sexton with two girls.  All right, you guys, anything else for Buck?  I think we can.  No, that was pretty good. 
[00:33:00]  It is funny that the news, by the way, is showing it like it's still happening.  This way you just keep watching.  Instead of showing that the park has been cleaned up.  It's cleaned up.  They're showing it like it's happening right now.  Like the arrests are going down.  Yeah, like they're still going down.  Yeah.  No, not really at this point.  What's this, Sam?  This is Foley Square.  Michael Moore just tweeted it 10 seconds.  Oh, what did Michael Moore say?  What's he doing?  Did he tweet this from his big lakefront mansion?  Yeah, why don't you invite them all to your mansion and your fucking property and your lake?  I think you got plenty of property there for these people to hang out for the winter. 
[00:33:30]  It's like Woodstock up there.  Hey, Buck, what do you think of Michael Moore?  Not a fan of his movies, not a fan of his politics.  Yeah, he's such an opportunistic shithead.  He sees his core audience here who are like suckling on his big fucking man teat for his books and his fucking movies and everything else, his website.  He sees a built-in audience.  He loves this shit.  Yeah, what has he given to the movement except his voice?  Yeah, I don't know, man. 
[00:34:00]  He's been showing up there.  He's been getting a lot of photo ops with them.  Oh, yeah.  Evading questions about his wealth.  But I think it's pretty rough when you got these big-time celebrities going down there that you know absolutely are part of the 1%.  And what are they saying to the protesters?  My voice is what I'm giving you?  I'm with you.  Who gives a fuck?  We are the 99% of the 1%.  Right.  I think massive donations should be made if you're one of those big-time celebrities that is part of the 1%.  Especially asking for other people's money. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  Not just attacking the guys that took the giant payouts, but just going after people who have a lot of money.  It's like you have a lot of money.  Unbelievable.  All right, so he tweeted a picture of Foley Park.  Where is Foley Park, Buck?  Foley Park is basically right next to, it's sort of like across from City Hall, really close to One Police Plaza, actually.  And it's, you know, where a bunch of sort of the big marches have gathered.  I was actually down there tonight after they'd all gotten kicked out, and they were having a General Assembly.  And, you know, the consensus from the General Assembly was, oh, gosh, what do we do now? 
[00:35:00]  Right.  It wasn't a Churchill moment for the year.  Well, why weren't they prepared for this?  They had to have known the city and the NYPD was going to, you know, try this eventually.  Yeah.  They didn't have a contingency plan.  They had no plan.  No plan.  No plan.  No, I think, you know, we'll see.  I mean, they have a lot of help from, you know, different union and community organizers and other groups that might be able to come in and try to, you know,  I don't know if they would give them a place to stay.  I don't know what they would do exactly. 
[00:35:30]  But, you know, they'll try to find something.  They're definitely going to come up with a way to make things difficult.  I mean, otherwise, it'll just seem like the movement has lost all the wind in the hills.  And I think this is going down in every city now, too?  Or I heard the mayors were getting together to try to end it, you know, together.  Yeah, they've been cracking down pretty much across the country on this.  I think in part, you know, once all the stuff about the sexual assault came out, then public opinion was like, this is just gross. 
[00:36:00]  You know, and then the people at that point who aren't going to support you, well, you really don't even care that much about their opinion anyway.  I mean, if you don't have a problem with the stuff you've been hearing about recently, you're not going to have a problem with anything these guys do.  Right.  And you'll be standing there with them throwing Molotov cocktails, calling yourself La RÃ©sistance.  Right on.  All right, Buck.  We'll let you go.  Buck Sexton in Occupy Her Ass.  You do have that porno name, Buck.  That is such a porno name.  It's great. 
[00:36:30]  Gentlemen, thanks for having me on.  He wants to keep his career going.  Theblaze.com.  He's got an article going up right now on what he saw overnight.  Thanks, Buck.  Buck Sexton in Blaze.  Blaze a trail up her ass.  He's doing well, too, because he started.  He was nickel sexting.  And he's really better.  That's a book.  Fuck.  There you go.  That's some breaking news right there, people.  Yeah.  Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City is in a bad place. 
[00:37:00]  It's not over.  I'm watching, I'm looking at Michael Moore's pictures, some of them.  Yeah.  What a, he's wording these things in a way that is so inaccurate.  All right.  What is he saying here?  Police pushing people.  And meanwhile, they're just kind of corralling them.  And what was some of the other ones?  It's like, I saw it's like the anti-terrorism unit was there.  Yeah.  NYPD counter-terrorism unit sent in.  Un-fucking-believable when the terrorists are Goldman Sachs. 
[00:37:30]  How about they needed officers down there?  And that's what you do.  The counter-terrorism cops are normally just cops.  They're cops.  Who, when there's some kind of terrorism going on, they, it's like SWAT.  Mm-hmm.  You know, SWAT teams are just cops.  Every day, they're just cops.  And then, and then when something happens, they get together and they be SWAT.  You just ruined something for me.  Really?  I never knew that. 
[00:38:00]  Like, I literally, I knew that they were real cops.  Oh, you thought they just hung out like SWAT?  Yes.  I thought they were like, where's the SWAT guys?  They're just having coffee, waiting for SWAT-like things.  Waiting.  All right.  We got a fucking situation.  I didn't know that they were just like regular guys.  He's like, da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Da-da-da.  Guys, I got an update on me.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  There they are, sitting around.  Oh, boy.  What are we doing?  We're just sitting around playing cards, drinking some coffee, you know, talking about 
[00:38:30]  shit that we've dealt with in the past.  Hey, remember that fucking guy holding that hostage in that building?  You went in there.  Oh, shit.  Something's going down.  Get to the SWAT van.  You thought that's how it was?  I thought all they did was like, what are you going to do?  I'm going to repel until 10.  Call me.  I'm busy repelling.  They're writing tickets.  They're just practicing repelling.  They're writing tickets for cell phone use in a car.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that either.  I didn't know they wore a couple different hats.  Stop breaking my heart. 
[00:39:00]  They're just cops that trained in special weapons and tactics.  They don't even have faces.  They really are just helmets.  I thought they were in a lair waiting for action.  A lair.  Did you think they always had fucking giant vests?  Of course.  And machine guns?  Full automatic weapons.  Yes.  Just bored half the time.  Just waiting and waiting and waiting for a situation.  They're like hall monitors in school.  They're just regular students and get a hall monitor thing.  What the fuck?  God, I want to be a SWAT guy. 
[00:39:30]  Who wouldn't?  More importantly, I got an update on the People's Library, Anthony.  What happened to the People's Library?  Because I've been very concerned about the People's Library.  The People's Library!  Which I've seen down there every time I've gone.  If you follow Occupy Wall Street and Street is ST, you get a lot of great tweets coming in.  The 5,000 books of the People's Library.  Burnt?  Like Hitler?  Have been thrown in the trash.  Books.  Who needs them?  They didn't even save the books. 
[00:40:00]  They should have burnt them in a big pile.  Right in front of them?  Yeah.  And then in the light of the flames, have speeches.  Yeah.  Fascist speeches about the Jews.  We should, I think we should break early today because we got Jason Segel at 745, Larry  King at 810, Chaz Bono at 915, and we got to talk about Herman Cain.  We got to talk about Sandusky and that creepy interview that Bob Costas did last night.  We got the highlights.  What a ghoul. 
[00:40:30]  He's going on the defensive.  Yeah, good move.  Kind of like.  You have to.  It's not helping him.  Did you hear this interview?  I did not.  Wait till you hear these clips, Jimmy.  Is it not?  I've heard the quotes.  He should have just kept his mouth shut.  Put it this way.  He's ripping off Uncle Paul by trying to defend himself.  Wait till you hear these clips.  I think he's making it way the fuck worse.  Oh, wow.  And then Bob Costas, I hope people picked up on his creepy blinking as the interview was 
[00:41:00]  going down.  Bob Costas was just blinking uncontrollably.  It was by phone, right?  Yeah.  So he had to just stare at the camera when they do those phone interviews.  And Bob Costas can't keep himself from blinking uncontrollably.  Opie Whoopty here is saying Chaz Bono is going to be awkward.  I disagree.  I disagree, too.  Why?  I saw Chaz's show.  I don't know.  There's no rhyme or reason.  It's just a listener adding in their two cents.  I think Chaz will be fun.  I mean, my whole point will be very easy. 
[00:41:30]  I don't get this shit.  I'm not going to say it that way.  And maybe she'll explain it.  Or he.  Or whatever.  That's where I'm at.  Maybe we learned something today.  Yeah.  I don't think it'll be awkward at all, actually.  No.  It's not my goal to attack her.  I don't understand this world whatsoever.  Him.  Him.  What?  Him.  Will she get mad if we say she?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  I saw Sharon interview say she by mistake.  Well, that's mommy.  Well, you know what?  For everyone else.  But that goes with the whole I don't get it thing. 
[00:42:00]  And maybe she opens our eyes today.  I don't know.  He.  He.  She.  He.  Chaz and I will explain it to you.  He.  Yeah.  Is it Chaz still?  Yeah.  Or is it Chuck?  It's Chaz.  It went from chastity to Chaz.  No, let's call Chuck, right?  Chaz.  Chuck's a manly name.  Let's call her Chuck.  Chuck Bono.  Chaz.  Chuck, right?  No, Chaz.  I think.  I think he likes Chaz.  Mr. Bono.  Oh, thank you.  Mr. Bono.  Mr. Bono.  Mr. Bono. 
[00:42:30]  The clips of the show I saw were actually good.  It was.  We didn't.  I thought he had the whole episode.  It was like these one minute clips, which give you like, you know, ten different moments  in the show.  But it was actually really interesting.  I was fucking annoyed at the end of the whole show.  I want to ask her about her girlfriend.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  The drinker.  That we met on Celebrity Fit Club.  If you watched that show back in the day.  Back in the day.  Was she on that?  This one now?  Or was the old?  Chaz.  Chaz.  Chaz.  Chaz.  What?  She had a girlfriend that I think that died.  No, this is a...  I think it's the current girlfriend that we saw for the first time on Celebrity Fit Club. 
[00:43:00]  And I believe she's still with Chaz.  And I want to know about that, too, man.  Because that woman, you know, wanted to be in a lesbian relationship.  Now she's in a heterosexual relationship.  This thing is really confusing.  Dude, I'm watching the clip and I'm watching them kiss.  And I'm like, as a lesbian, isn't it weird to kiss?  Like the breasts are gone and with the beard.  That's like not what she signed on for.  It's a guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's his chick?  Yeah.  Is that a current... 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, that's her then.  Not bad.  Then he stayed.  He...  Chaz, whatever, stayed with her.  Or she stayed with him.  Nice alabaster skin.  Yeah.  That's the same girl that's been around for a while.  So...  Yeah, I don't think it's going to be awkward.  I hope she's open because...  He.  What?  He.  He.  He.  You know, because maybe we learn.  Maybe we learn.  I don't know.  Learn.  Maybe it's time to learn something.  What?  On this show?  Maybe.  Maybe it's just time to learn.  Impossible.  And Herman Cain, you do have that clip today, right, Sam? 
[00:44:00]  I think Herman Cain is...  Herman Cain is officially over.  That was one of the last nails in that call.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  Oh, God.  He is just...  Really?  Did I fucking miss it again?  I saw clips of him throughout the past few months where he was talking about things,  you know, nuclear and just mispronouncing stuff and just sounding generally like an idiot.  He was barely holding on.  Barely.  What he said yesterday, it's over for him now.  So it's over for Perry already.  It's over for Herman Cain.  And now you've got this Newt Gingrich rising to the top, which is crazy talk. 
[00:44:30]  Rising to the top.  Yeah, Herman Cain was asked about Obama and his opinion on Obama's handling of Libya.  Could you get that, Sam?  Because we're doing it now.  He froze up.  Oh, I'm just going to...  No, it's fine.  I don't care.  Take a break and come back with it.  Let's do it.  But he just...  He froze up like you talking about ones and zeros.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  And then he's trying to say that he was gathering his thoughts, but no one, no one is going  to believe that one.  If he looks like that, gathering his thoughts, I hope we don't have a fucking problem if 
[00:45:00]  he was in the White House.  Right.  Because as he's sitting there gathering his thoughts, missiles would be coming over the  polls.  So it's Herman Cain stumbles on Libya questions.  You know, before we play that, it's funny.  We always like...  And I'm kind of caught on this, too.  Like, when politicians fuck up, we're always like, why don't they just admit it?  But then Rick Perry really did just go, oops, like, I fucked up.  It happens.  He knew what he was saying, even though I think he's a dick.  Right.  But it's like, when they do do that, it really does look bad.  Like, I say they should be honest, but when they're honest, it's like, eh, fuck you and 
[00:45:30]  your honesty.  Because it looks bad either way.  For some reason, we want our politicians perfect.  We want these perfect people, and it's something that no one could ever be.  But if you think of past presidents, they didn't make mistakes like that.  They cover them well.  Basic questions.  Yeah.  George W. Bush never fucked up a basic question like that.  No.  No, he didn't.  There are tricks, by the way, to get it.  Clinton never did.  Fucking Reagan never did. 
[00:46:00]  Yes.  Obama never did, as far as basic government questions, the structure of government goes.  I know a guy who's written speeches...  I forgot to duck.  Sorry.  Yeah, it's okay.  I've written speeches for Bush and Obama, and he said the way to do it is they teach  you to get everything back to the one of three things that you want to talk about.  It's an art form to take any fucking question.  That's why it's annoying when they do it.  That's why they never answer the fucking question.  That's why they're always like, all right, I don't want to hear that.  But that's how they avoid looking stupid, is they get it back to something they can discuss. 
[00:46:30]  We see that happen on this dumb show with celebrities.  We're like, wait, what?  We're talking about your movie again?  And we were asking about that thing.  Exactly.  We're asking about those child rape charges.  What happened?  How'd you get it back to the movie?  We see it done here.  It gets back to racism, AIDS, and what else?  Kid touching.  Fat and fat Eric.  Fat Iraq.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying it's a subject.  I don't go for it.  Oh, boy.  He didn't look happy about that.  But he knew what I meant.  Oh, boy.  Iraq, you don't think you're fatter than Chaz, right?  No.  All right, good.  Iraq is the hippopotam.  More feminine.  Hippopotam. 
[00:47:00]  You want the Hermit Cain now?  Yes, definitely.  I want to hear what he said.  I didn't see this.  It's long.  It's good, though.  It's good.  Yeah.  Sam's making believe you saw this before the show.  You didn't, Sam.  You didn't see it, Sam.  You don't even know who that is.  How did I find it?  You were too busy dreaming about The Rock coming back last night.  Mick Foley did, too.  The Rock says...  All right, now I need to know.  But not right now.  Okay.  Because we love Mick Foley.  He's a friend of the show.  I bet he is.  The Rock is sort of a friend.  Oh, by the way, I got a text last night.  Yeah.  Before I forget.  It was yesterday from my ex-girlfriend, who's still a friend of mine. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, boy.  OMG.  I just found out Herman Cain is black.  And I wrote, Jesus, really?  And she wrote, yes.  I was just reading articles about him for months, but none had a picture.  Makes me believe he did harass those women, though.  Made me laugh.  She's hilarious.  All right.  Hit this thing.  That's nice music from Herman Cain.  Oh, boy.  Stupid ads. 
[00:48:00]  Don't you love the ads?  And how long was the ad?  Okay, here you go.  Is President Obama on Libya or not?  Okay, Libya.  I know Libya.  I grabbed for it.  I don't know Libya.  President Obama.  What's he doing?  Supported the uprising.  Correct.  President Obama called for the removal of Qaddafi. 
[00:48:30]  Just want to make sure we're talking about it.  Oh, my God.  He is trying to get the answer through asking that question.  He is completely lost.  No idea.  He is fucking...  He's looking for help.  He completely...  Just blew it.  It's fucked up.  Yeah.  Go back to making pizzas.  It's over.  His whole thing was about the economy and, you know, taxes and that shit.  And as far as, you know, that whole thing of dealing with other nations... 
[00:49:00]  It's kind of important to the job.  He has no fucking clue.  Not even no clue like other people have no clue, but you have a general idea.  He has no fucking clue.  He was asking him to help him.  Yes.  He was going to support...  I just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing.  The same thing.  In other words, I just want to make sure we're talking about the thing.  Yeah, that's...  Not the same thing.  Am I right here?  That's like going to a psychic and the psychic's like, you're married.  Yeah.  You're married.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Is there a person in your life named...  Exactly.  That type of shit.  Start with an A.  Right.  Fishing around hoping that you're going to help.  That's exactly what he's doing here.  He's lost.  By the way, Obama has turned into the Michael Corleone of fucking foreign policy.  No one thought he would be as tough as he is.  He's taking care of all fucking Gaddafi, al-Walaki, bin Laden.  He's fucking really cleaning house in the Middle East.  Settling all family business.  Yeah.  Gets settled.  He certainly is.  All right, well...  Although Iran, he doesn't quite know what to do about that. 
[00:50:00]  Maybe not yet, but nobody does.  Bush didn't either.  I think Israel will take care of that fucking thing.  Yeah, I don't think we should touch Iran.  That should be Israel's...  Some airstrikes.  Yes, of course.  Right.  Let's get back to the Herman Cain.  President Obama called for the removal of Gaddafi.  Just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing before I say, yes, I agreed.  I know I didn't agree.  I do not agree with the way he handled it for the following reason. 
[00:50:30]  No, that's a different one.  What?  A different what?  He's fidgeting in his chair?  I've got to go back and see.  Oh, gosh.  This is bad.  Got all this stuff twirling around in my head.  Do you?  Why don't you grab a vagina?  Specifically, what are you asking me?  Did I agree or not disagree with you?  Oh, my God.  I was asking if you agree...  Craig was asking me about the Bush foreign policy, so I was taking a specific example from the Obama administration that was controversial within his own administration on what he should have done and not done. 
[00:51:00]  I would send pieces over to the Libya.  You know, it's an issue that's come up since you've been running for office, and I was wondering how...  Indubitably.  Here's what I would have...  I would have done a better job of determining who the opposition is.  Who am that opposition? 
[00:51:30]  People had some of that information.  Based upon who made up that opposition.  Based upon who made up that opposition.  He's bullshitting his way through an essay.  He's using a lot of words.  That mean nothing.  And instead of writing couldn't, you write could not because it's one more word in the essay.  He's caught.  That's a very fair question.  That's not a bad question.  Why couldn't you say you agree with him?  You know what? 
[00:52:00]  I think the president did a good job there.  That's the meat of it right there.  We thought it was going to be a ground problem, and it wasn't.  And I didn't think he would do a good job, and he did.  Or just say I disagree with him, because why should we go in and support a revolution in this country when other countries like Syria are doing the same thing, and we're not backing them?  What's the criteria for American involvement in these revolutions?  But he doesn't know what's going on.  But he's a dummy.  I know pizza crust. 
[00:52:30]  I know tomato sauce.  I know cheese.  I know pepperoni.  The rest of the clip really is them trying to get him to firm up his answer, and him saying,  No.  No, I wasn't saying that.  I was saying what?  It was a vagary, because he absolutely has no idea about the solution.  I was saying, you get free cheesy bread with every large pie from Godfather Pizza.  I think they're both really bad, what Perry did and what Kane did, but this obviously is way the fuck worse. 
[00:53:00]  Way worse.  This is like, you cannot be the president of this country.  Perry had a brain fart, I hate to say that, but one of those dumb things that happens when you're just on the spot.  But to be in a little room with one guy and fuck this up, especially when you can recover, there's no one yelling at you.  He's just like, wait a minute now, and then he just fucked up again.  And his body language says a lot, too.  He doesn't have control of the situation.  He's ho.  He's fidgeting and all sorts of shit.  He knows he's in the middle of something that he doesn't know anything about. 
[00:53:30]  We should take a break, because this show's going to get extremely busy.  We've got Chuck Bono coming in at 9.15, Larry King at 8.10, and Jason Segel, the star, the producer, I think he pretty much did everything, the writer of the Muppets.  He's been working on this project for years, if you remember.  We talked to him about three years ago, and he was already working on this damn thing.  No way, Jose.  Fuck yeah.  And you know what?  As far as a family movie goes, right on.  It's going to do... 
[00:54:00]  Manson family.  It's going to do ridiculous numbers, I do believe.  Uh, Sandusky next.  Holy fuck.  Wait to hear some of the clips from the interview he did with Bob Costas.  I buy it.  Let him go.  Holy fuck.  Wait to hear this shit.  I buy it.  He didn't do nothing wrong.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  No!  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU Live.  Here's the latest batch of F years. 
[00:54:30]  Fuck you!  To the guy who said he had a chick with double D tits and dick-sucking lips, she's a fatty.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big fuck you out to my fucking balls.  I decide to get the flu.  Fucking, my balls are like saltwater caffeine.  And they're sticking to everything, and they're fucking annoying.  Hey, fuck you, balls.  Fuck you!  This fuck to you goes out to my ex-girlfriend.  Did you leave me for a short guy that is married? 
[00:55:00]  Well, now I am doing your 22-year-old niece.  She tastes so sweet.  Fuck you!  This FU goes out to all the primetime Sam Roberts haters.  Fuck you!  Sam's the shit.  Fuck you, haters.  Fuck you!  This fuck you goes out to my stupid boss.  Your secretary was out sick today, so you made me be your secretary.  But I spent my day answering your phone calls and making sure you had a hot cup of coffee.  Because God forbid you actually do something for your fucking self. 
[00:55:30]  You suck.  You make me sick.  You fucking God!  Fuck you!  This FU goes out to intern Matt, you big piece of shit.  Get a fucking job, you fucking loser.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!

I just want to say fuck you to everybody. 
[00:56:00]  Go fuck your mother.  Hey, you fool.  Everyone of you, go fuck yourself.  And your mom.  And your dad.  I fucking hate everybody.  Fuck you, everyone.  Go fuck your mother.  Fuck you!  Yeah, fuck you, Bobo.  Because now my husband, I talk about football, his penis goes down.  I talk about facts, it goes back up.  What the hell?  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1. 
[00:56:30]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that.  99, maybe.  And he goes, um...  Dude, what are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village.  I'm going to fucking hang out and I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  On the way over, we cabbed it and some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books 
[00:57:00]  and notebooks.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is it?  A guy from Saturday Night Live is going to send him back his books.  Well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass for the minute I get it.  For the minute I get, he's like, dude, what are you doing with the fucking knap?  Give me what the fuck?  It's ridiculous.  He looks like a fag walking around with his fucking knapsack.  So, I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy. 
[00:57:30]  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  It'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  I said, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up and the bags  go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  Are we hanging?  Fuck the knapsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting in my face.  Are we hanging or what?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this. 
[00:58:00]  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  We're back, baby.  We're better than ever. 
[00:58:30]  We're back, we're back, together forever.  We're back, we're back, we're better than ever.  We're back, we're back, together forever. 
[00:59:00]  We're back, we're back, together forever.  Ah, yes. 
[00:59:30]  Well.  You want to get topical with the sex man or you want to do it ourselves?  I'm thinking, because I hear Jimmy doing We're Back and Better Than Ever, and then I'm  hearing Van Halen, that I'm thinking maybe the sex man has a little something for us  this morning. 
[01:00:00]  I'm going to guess it's a two for Tuesday type of thing.  Yeah?  Yeah, because he just played two Van Halen songs.  He did.  Let's find out.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  Good morning.  Hi, sex man.  Hi, sex man.  Hi, guys.  Are you looking forward to the Chuck Bono interview?  Yeah, I think he'll do good.  Chaz.  What time is she going to be here?  Yeah.  Nine, I think.  Nine?  Nine. 
[01:00:30]  Nine.  Nine.  I have nine.  What do you got?  So, sex man, what is the deal with Van Halen?  Well, guys, Van Halen signed to Interscope Records for their first new album in 13 years.  They're back.  What's it going to be called?  Irrelevant?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Who gives a shit?  Who's going to be singing?  That I don't know.  Oh, that's a good question.  I think it's David Lee.  I think I do know him.  DLR? 
[01:01:00]  I think it's David Lee.  Yeah?  DLR is going to be at the helm again.  I think they're getting along.  I think they're getting along.  They have to get along.  You know what I mean?  Oh, God.  It's the only way this band's going to work now is to get everyone back together.  What about, what's his name there?  The guy that hangs with Hagar, who left the band.  Michael Anthony.  Michael Anthony.  Is he back?  And better than ever?  Or is he playing with Sammy Hagar and the Wabos?  Shut up.  Enough with Wabo.  Cabo Wabo.  But Sammy Hagar likes us.  A bunch of moves there. 
[01:01:30]  We've got to learn from Hollywood.  We can't beat everyone up.  Sammy's 75.  But he likes us.  No, he doesn't.  He didn't come on the show.  He's supposed to come on.  Well, because we want him to play, I guess.  Ah, you're right there.  Fuck Sammy and his greatest American hero hair.  All right, fair enough.  Fuck him and his Wabos.  If he didn't do our show, then fuck him.  Hey, Sandusky, we've got to get right into this because we've got a very busy show today.  Sandusky decided it would be really smart to do an interview with Bob Costas.  Bob Costas. 
[01:02:00]  He sat down.  What was he gunning for here?  What do you think he was trying to do with this interview?  Well, he realizes that everyone thinks he's a big piece of shit.  A pedophile.  He's like the most hated guy in the country.  What is this picture that just popped up?  It's never good when you're surrounded by children and their eyes have those black bars over them.  Yeah.  That means those kids are either dead or have been touched funny.  Yeah, it's my Christmas card.  All the boys touching my shoulders. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  What's that picture?  A little Christmas gathering at his house?  Yeah, a little gathering.  Isn't he married, this guy?  Where's his wife during this whole fucking thing?  Anyone?  Dude, that's fucking...  That's the horrible part is he's married.  He has six adopted kids.  He has to tell his family.  That's why these guys have to go on the denial trail if they did it.  It was like, fuck it.  What's the guy who was tapping the foot?  Larry Craig.  My opinion of him is that I think he's an absolute homosexual. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And I think that he's just caught in a place where he can't admit it because his wife probably said to him,  Right.  Is that true?  No.  You're kidding me.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, Sandusky didn't help his cause when he talked to Bob Costas last night.  No.  Some kind of new show that Brian Williams is doing.  What is it?  Yeah, it's called Meet the Pedo.  Meet the Pedo.  Rock Center is the name of the program.  What is it called?  Rock Center.  Oh, I wrong.  With The Rock?  Rock Center.  I wish it was with The Rock.  The Rock Center. 
[01:03:30]  That would be the best show ever.  Oh.  The Rock is cooking.  Fuck.  The Rock's got a new show on NBC.  That's awesome.  That's the news in the third person.  The Rock Center picked up Chelsea Clinton also as a kind of a reporter kind of.  He just called it The Rock Center.  The Rock Center.  It is The Rock Center.  No, it's Rock Center.  That's pretty cool.  You know, The Rock Center.  Right.  All right, let's play these clips because Jason Segel's going to be here very soon.  All right.  Sandusky says he's innocent and explains what he did. 
[01:04:00]  All right, good.  You know what?  When someone says you're fucking a boy in the shower, a 10-year-old.  Yeah.  You do need an explanation.  I'm sure you could talk your way out of it.  Let's try something different today.  Yeah.  Let's all have a complete open mind and then let's tap out when you've heard enough.  All right.  Okay.  That sounds good.  And I know the gag is to tap out as soon as you hear his voice.  Immediately.  I know.  So let's all...  Tap out now.  Let's all acknowledge we all thought that. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  I want to know when you would actually tap out and go, this guy's full of shit.  There are multiple accusers, multiple eyewitnesses to various aspects of the abuse.  A reasonable person says where there's this much smoke, there must be plenty of fire.  Fire in a young boy's asshole.  I say that I am innocent of those charges.  Innocent?  Good enough for me.  Completely innocent and falsely accused in every aspect?  Well, I could say that, you know, I have done some of those things. 
[01:05:00]  I have horsed around with kids.  I have showered after workouts.  Shower.  That's where I would tap out.  Horse around, you shower after a workout.  What's the big deal?  You don't say, I've done some of those things.  You say, yes.  Right.  Innocent of all of those charges.  Of all charges.  They've taken innocent things and they've made them more horrible.  I think he blew it because he's like, I've done some of those things.  I think he's more mad that maybe other things they're accusing him of doing, he didn't do. 
[01:05:30]  But he did enough.  I did enough.  You know, just showering and horse gagging around.  Horsing around, I would even give him.  Whatever.  Horsing around.  As soon as he said, I've showered.  Horseplay.  I've showered.  You can't shower with a board.  Does he explain the showering and why he did it?  Well, he's an athlete.  Oh, okay.  After workouts.  I have hugged them and I have touched their leg.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  All right.  Look, if you're hugging them and touching their legs, I don't get what he's going for here.  I have never touched a kid's leg.  Through your pre-cum.  I'm absolutely coming here.  I've got nephews.  I got a son.  I've never.  No.  No.  You don't touch kids' legs.  No.  That was devastating.  To me saying we've showered after. 
[01:06:30]  We've showered after things, but I've been around athletes my whole life.  This guy stinks at defending himself.  You know what?  I've been an athlete my whole life.  Me too.  I've never showered with an adult and I've never seen an adult shower with any other athletes.  No.  What makes these clips fun too, by the way, it kind of sounds like Gene Simmons.  Yeah.  I just want to put that in people's mind.  Makes it a little more fun for everybody.  I have touched their leg without intent of sexual contact. 
[01:07:00]  But, so if you look at it that way, there are things that wouldn't, you know, would be accurate.  I love how he says, if you look at it that way, meaning please look at it this way.  If you look at it that way, it's not completely accurate.  I don't understand, like, Bob Costas, why he doesn't, like, aggressively, you know, talk to this guy.  I don't get when these guys get the big interviews and then they kind of, you know, play their role. 
[01:07:30]  I guess they figure you get more with honey.  And he's sinking himself.  The guy's sinking himself.  Yeah, he really is.  He's giving Costas good stuff.  It's not like he just went, no.  Like, he's continually talking, so Bob is actually, all right.  The more he talks, he's burying himself.  That's fair enough.  Because the story, it wouldn't be Costas said something to him.  It would be what he said back.  And it's almost, this guy's fucking bizarre.  He reminds me of a serial killer.  Like, his book was called Touched.  And it's almost like the way he's defending himself, here's my take on it, is that he sounds 
[01:08:00]  like somebody who's trying to confess without confessing.  Yeah.  Like, are you guilty?  Well, I've done some of the things they say.  Instead of just saying no, I'm innocent of all charges.  Not of all these things.  He's weird.  He keeps saying.  Yeah.  It's almost like if your girlfriend says, did you cheat on me?  And you said, yes, I cheated on you.  If you mean just talking to a girl, well, why did you say, yes, I cheated?  You could have just said no.  So maybe he's having a tough time sleeping at night, and this is his way of kind of cleansing  his soul a little bit.  Deep psychological shit. 
[01:08:30]  In a weird way.  I think people who do this crazy or sick shit, a lot of, again, serial killers, why do they  taunt the cops?  They have a need to fucking get it out.  It's weird.  Right.  All right.  Sandusky continues, says there was no sexual contact.  Are you denying that you had any inappropriate sexual contact with any of these underage  boys?  Yes, I am.  Never touched their genitals?  Never engaged in oral sex?  Right.  What about Mike McQuarrie, the grad assistant who, in 2002, walked into the shower, where 
[01:09:00]  he says, in specific, he's 10 or 11 years old, that his hands were up against the shower  wall, and he heard rhythmic slap, slap, slapping sounds, and he described that as a rape.  I would say that that's false.  What would be his motive to lie?  You'd have to ask him that.  You know what?  Well, he would say, I'm not lying.  You'd have to ask him that.  He'd go, oh, I'm not lying.  I heard slap, slap, slap, and saw him pinning a kid against the wall. 
[01:09:30]  Why would McQuarrie, right?  McQuarrie do.  McQuarrie.  Why would he report that, knowing it would fuck up his entire career?  He was in a really tough spot, obviously, and in the end, should have done more.  By the way, McQuarrie catching him, that's like a guy named McPussy Lips walking on a  rape.  We've talked about this over the years, though.  The name always works out in the end.  Didn't that description just conjure up, like, Sandusky's old balls just smashing against 
[01:10:00]  that tight, young buttock?  It always amazes me, like, how can an adult male rape, like, how could it, like, if I had  a finger in my ass and I'd scream, how could a kid take that without just screaming bloody  murder?  How does that happen physically?  They're so resilient.  Uh, yes.  I got a theory on that.  Uh-oh.  This fucking loser has a tiny fucking penis.  Oh, you think he's got a little wee-wee?  It's still the...  It's still...  Bite size.  It probably has a little peener.  Child size.  Yeah, a little peener.  Fun size.  Kid's meal.  Fun size. 
[01:10:30]  Wow.  That's the first time I've heard the slap, slap, slap.  Oh, you didn't hear that?  No.  Slap, slap, slap.  Oh, it's very graphic.  In a wet shower, he's just rhythmically, rhythmically.  You know what fucking sounds like.  Of course.  McQuarrie, all he wanted to do was be a head football coach, so why would he fucking report  this?  Yeah.  That would put him in a bad spot.  You know, if you want to work your way up at Penn State, you don't make something up  about one of the coaches raping a 10-year-old.  Right.  You gotta...  It's novel.  It's a novel approach to getting ahead in your career, but I don't think it works. 
[01:11:00]  That's how Blatter got his gig.  He actually made whoever was...  I don't know who was in front of him, but he actually made up rumors about the guy.  He said the guy was a goat fucker, and they had to fire him.  Hey, why is Bob Costas doing the interview, Sam, if it's The Rock Show?  The Rock says, I don't want to ask about child rape.  Of course The Rock.  The Rock needs to know.  It's The Rock Center.  The Rock Center?  No, it's not The Rock Center. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, is it Dwayne Johnson Center?  Dwayne The Rock Johnson Center.  When does The Rock appear?  I would...  If The Rock Center were on every night hosted by The Rock, I would never miss it.  You love him?  Love The Rock.  How great would it be if The Rock interviewed this guy, though?  That'd be good.  This would be great.  Were you raping him, you jabroni?  He would call him a Rudy Poo.  A Rudy Poo.  Are you a Rudy Poo?  He would ask if he wants to check into the SmackDown Hotel.  Yeah.  Just all these horrible wrestling cliches. 
[01:12:00]  He's not even taking it seriously.  See, if SNL is listening and Sam is convinced they are...  Oh, Rock.  ...that they listen just to rip off Sam, they should take this fucking bit and go with it.  The Rock interviewing fucking...  The Rock Center.  The Rock Center.  Threatening to smack the lips off his face.  That's a...  Did he threaten to do that?  He asks people, how's your lips?  And as they're answering, he says, because I'm going to smack them off your face.  Oh, yeah.  How's your lips?  Fucking running back and forth in the shower. 
[01:12:30]  He gives him the people's elbow.  Yes.  That'd be great.  Was he the best Mike guy?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I mean, there's not...  There's nobody.  Was Bob Backlund better?  Bob Backlund was not a Mike guy.  Bob Backlund was not strong on the Mike.  He was more technical prowess.  Well, I just want to go in there and have a good match and do the best I can.  B-double-O, Bob.  Back to Sandusky.  Why?  You'd have to ask him that.  What did happen in the shower the night that Mike McQuarrie happened upon you and the young boy? 
[01:13:00]  Okay, we were showering and horsing around.  Those two you can't do ever.  You can't be...  Horsing around.  Showering with a boy and horsing around.  That's it.  That's an old man's excuse, by the way.  Horsing around.  That's an old man's excuse.  Nobody under the age of 40 would say horsing around in a shower with a 10-year-old.  Yes.  That would have worked...  That excuse would have worked in 1969. 
[01:13:30]  If that's happened in 1970, he was horsing around with the boy.  Horseplay.  Horseplay.  It's fine.  He was horsing around.  The kid put his genitals in his flat hand and Sandusky ate it like a horse.  Like a sugar cube?  So as not to nibble any fingers off.  That's great.  But as soon as your balls are out, it's not horsing around anymore.  Is that a rule of thumb?  Yes.  As soon as your balls are out, it's not horsing around.  You can horse around with another guy or if you're... 
[01:14:00]  You know what I mean?  But as soon as your balls are out, it's not horsing around anymore.  The difference between a push-up and a rape is the woman laying under you.  There you go.  It's true.  Very true.  And he actually turned all the showers on and was actually sliding across the floor.  And we were...  He slid into my penis.  I recall possibly, like, snapping a towel on a horseplay.  Oh, the old snapping a towel never sounds good. 
[01:14:30]  That is so hack.  But that's the rhythmic sound.  That's so hack.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  We were just continually...  Yeah.  The kid is sliding around because he's trying to get the fuck out of there.  Oh, my God.  He's moonwalking away from him.  I remember Keith Robinson, we were at the Comedy Cellar, and he was just joking with Lynn  Coplitz.  And he was just saying that somebody fumbled with her when she was young.  Mr. Smitters fumbled with her.  And he said that he put fucking, like, baby oil on her feet so she couldn't run away on  the wood floor. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, shit.  I was just laughing at the visual of molesting someone with baby oil on their feet so they  can't run.  Want to continue?  Yes, please.  Where is he at?  We're still okay.  We're still okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Sandusky addresses previous allegations.  In 1998, a mother confronts you about taking a shower with her son and inappropriately  touching him.  Two detectives eavesdrop on her conversations with you, and you admit that maybe your private  parts touched her son. 
[01:15:30]  Well.  What happened there?  I can't be sure.  I can't exactly recall what was said there.  The Reagan defense.  In terms of what I did say.  By the way, can you pause real quick?  Here's to me, something that says you're lying is when you say in terms of.  In terms of.  That's the fucking, you're lying when you say in terms of.  No one's told the truth and said in terms of.  You just say it.  Well, in terms of cheating, I mean, I did touch the girl's breast, honey, but I wasn't trying 
[01:16:00]  to be sexual.  In terms of.  What I find creepy is how calm he is.  That's really creepy.  Yes, yeah.  Very creepy.  If you don't recall, there was a boy and, well, my penis may have gone in him, but I don't  remember his weapons for boy ass.  This type of stuff happens all the time.  You're taking a shower and he runs over and he goes, Uncle Paul and your wiener bumps him. 
[01:16:30]  He may have touched him with his penis.  It happens.  Nobody's got to go telling nobody.  Everybody, if your wiener bumps somebody, you go, excuse me, look what you did.  Everybody laughs.  Of course they do, Uncle Paul.  Sure, they do.  It's fun.  During one of those conversations, you said, I understand, I was wrong, I wish I could 
[01:17:00]  get forgiveness, speaking now with the mother, I know I won't get it from you, I wish I were  dead.  A guy falsely accused or a guy whose actions have been misinterpreted doesn't respond that  way, does he?  I don't know, I didn't say, to my recollection, that I wish I were dead.  I was hopeful that we could reconcile things.  Yeah, I bet you were hopeful you could reconcile things without fucking going to jail. 
[01:17:30]  It's creeping me out.  Yeah, what a fucking creep this guy is.  And you're absolutely right, Bob Costas is doing a great job.  Great job.  Just letting him talk.  Yeah, and I like the fact that Bob came after him and said, well, that's not the way an  innocent guy defends it.  And he's right.  Although I'm bummed that The Rock isn't doing the big interview for his own show.  It kind of sucks that he gave this one to Bob Costas.  I like the fact that he's blaming the killer.  Yeah, my genitals might have touched.  My genitals have never accidentally touched a tenure.  And then he said, if he felt hurt, then he apologizes. 
[01:18:00]  Like, of course, you don't wonder if it was bad, or if the kid just, you know, well, well,  the old man's dick touched me.  It doesn't happen.  It doesn't happen in an innocent situation where your dick touches a 10-year-old.  Never.  Never.  Never.  No.  He's fucking lying.  I'm going to go on record.  He's lying.  If you say your dick accidentally touched a 10-year-old, I'm going to take a legal risk.  You're full of shit.  Yes. 
[01:18:30]  Adults are completely paranoid to be naked in front of fucking children.  Even your own.  Even your own.  You're a little like, this is, you know, let's get the clothes on.  But as a coach.  Child's such a vague word.  Huh?  Jesus.  You know, sometimes it happens.  They wander in because they hear the cartoons playing.  And your hand is busy on your you-know-what.  And they come over, they go, what's that?  And you go, it's the candy dispenser.  And they start kissing. 
[01:19:00]  They don't want that candy.  Kiss the pens.  Oh, the Sirius box is busted open.  And look, look, now all the logos come out.  We're watching the new Sirius logos.  Where's ours?  Look, watch, watch.  It's over on the left.  It's the blue collar.  It's over on the left.  There it is.  Look, look, look.  Yay.  No, you missed it.  If it doesn't get the front and center placement, that the big ones do.  And then it comes back.  Watch.  Watch.  The big ones come.  That goes back in.  Watch.  Oh, there it is.  The big ones come through the center of the shot.  We're pretty close to the center.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I can't.  I gotta admit. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, we're in it.  That's nice.  All right.  Some of the shit I've said recently, I'll give him that one.  I'll give him that.  Definitely.  I'm right on the edge.  He was here yesterday.  Huh?  He was here.  Who?  Turn it off.  I thought you were doing that Rory.  From the fucking, uh...  Oh, he was back?  Yeah, they all come back.  Nice.  Sandusky talks about the janitor who caught him blowing a kid.  Oh, what?  Because a janitor...  What a janitor, Budinsky.  Yeah, I told him to put...  Shortly after that, in 2000, a janitor said that he saw you performing oral sex on a young 
[01:20:00]  boy in the showers in the Penn State locker facility.  Did that happen?  No.  How could somebody think they saw something as extreme as...  Pause this, please.  There's an explanation for this.  He dropped something.  I told the janitor to put sawdust on it.  And the boy was bending over.  And I was yelling, yay!  And my penis bumped his face for a few minutes.  It was an accident. 
[01:20:30]  That doesn't sound like that could happen.  That janitor's lying.  Mind your business, get the mop, I said.  There's been an accident.  Why are all these accusations for the one guy?  I've never been accused of fucking a 10-year-old.  This is crazy.  Never.  Even Ant has it, which is miraculous.  I know.  There's been so many accusations, too, by different people in different places.  I mean, no one just picks on someone like this.  How about you fuck the kid in a motel, stupid?  Yeah.  How about you don't do it on the 50-yard line all the time? 
[01:21:00]  Because a janitor's catching him, the guy's catching him.  He's in public.  Jesus.  I hope Bob Costas asks, why is everyone accusing you of all these...  These different incidences that I...  Think they saw something as extreme and shocking as that when it hadn't occurred.  And what would possibly be their motivation to fabricate it?  You'd have to ask them.  You'd have to ask them.  Because I saw it.  realize that if all of these accusations are false, you are the unluckiest and most persecuted man that any of us has ever heard about. 
[01:21:30]  He'll agree with us.  Oh, I don't know what you want me to say.  I don't think that these have been the best days of my life.  Sounds like he's got his cock in his head.  Dude, he sounds like he's fucking jacked.  Like he's looking at fucking porn jacked.  I can't help it.  This is exactly what I want.  He can't help it.  I get to talk about this on national TV.  Oh, my God.  He sounds like he's all horned up.  He's a fucking creep, this guy.  Fuck yeah, man. 
[01:22:00]  What a fucking creep.  He goes, you'll have to ask them, knowing that they would say, well, yes, I saw him fucking a boy.  And how about you take a guess as to why they're lying?  Yeah, yeah.  How about when someone says, if someone accused me of sucking a 10-year-old's dick, I wouldn't go, well, I don't know why he'd say that for Pete's sake.  I would attack that motherfucker forever.  Worst career move ever is the guy that's the lawyer for Sandusky.  Worst career move ever.  That's a tough win, man.  I know a fucking lawyer's like taking on some of these cases for whatever reason, but this is a tough one, man. 
[01:22:30]  Sandusky talks about Joe Paterno in Penn State.  Oh, good.  To your knowledge, did Joe Paterno have any information regarding objectionable activities on your part prior to that report in 2002?  I can't totally answer that question.  My answer would be no.  Did Joe Paterno at any time ever speak to you directly about your behavior?  No. 
[01:23:00]  Never?  No.  He never asked you about what you might have done?  No.  He never asked you if you needed help, if you needed counseling?  No.  Never expressed disapproval of any kind?  No.  If that's true, by the way, great job by Costas.  If that's true, then fuck Joe Paterno and all the people that were saying, well, Joe Pa should finish.  Fuck him.  Joe Pa.  He just threw Joe Pa under the bus right there.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  If he's telling the truth.  Oh, poor Joe Pa.  I know.  I agree.  Poor Joe Pa.  He should have been able to run off that field one more time. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  Maybe he could have at halftime and confronted the guy.  Why are you fucking 10-year-olds on the mouth and ass on Penn State property?  Why are you doing that?  Maybe Joe Pa could have done that instead of burying his fucking old man head in the sand.  Fuck him.  How do you feel about what has happened to Penn State and to Joe Paterno and to the Penn State football program?  How great would it be if he said, you know, it's the one thing I'm proud of is that I brought him down and that I've disgraced the school.  I've disgraced the school completely through my hijinks and horseplay. 
[01:24:00]  I don't know why, but I've just been laughing for two weeks at this whole funny threes company like this.  Big misunderstanding.  Big misunderstanding.  ...and to the Penn State football program and your part in it.  Well, how would you think that I would feel about a university that I attended, about people that I've worked with?  Is he sedated?  People that I care so much about.  How do you think I would feel about it? 
[01:24:30]  No more kids.  I feel horrible.  You feel horrible.  Do you feel culpable?  I'm not sure I know what you mean.  Do you feel guilty?  He doesn't know a culpable guilty.  Do you feel as if it's your fault?  No, I don't think it's my fault.  Of course it's your fault.  I've obviously played a part in this.  How would you define the part you've played?  What are you willing to concede that you've done that was wrong and you wish you had not done it? 
[01:25:00]  Well, in retrospect, I shouldn't have showered with those kids.  Understatement of the year.  Yeah, that's what hits me the most.  Okay, faggot!  What's next?  He shouldn't have showered with them kids.  No shit!  You're like...  Wow!  Yeah.  Kostas is doing a great job, man.  Yeah, I was completely wrong.  He's doing a great job.  I've never heard him do an interview like this. 
[01:25:30]  Like, where he's actually...  It's always been fluff sports interviews.  I've never heard him actually go after somebody.  Yeah, he's a good interviewer.  This guy does not fucking get it.  He's delusional.  You know what's really got to be getting him?  He loves, loves sex with young boys.  And those days are done.  He can't slip out and sneak out and have sex with them.  Or even jerk off online.  We got one more clip that we're going to have to save for a little later on in the show.  Because Jason's here.  So we're going to take a quick break before he gets in.  Okay.  Sandusky says he's not a pedophile. 
[01:26:00]  We have that clip for a little later on.  First, Jason Segel next.  Promoting the Muppets.  And I think it's going to seg right into Larry King as well.  Perfect.  So stay there.  Serious, Serious, XS.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  We got Jason Segel entering the studio.  There he is.  Saw the new Muppets movie yesterday.  And I told Jason personally how much I liked it. 
[01:26:30]  That's what I did.  Oh, a little pre-interview.  Because I don't want it to look like I'm just saying it for the radio show.  I walked down the hall and I said,  Jason saw it yesterday and I love the Muppets.  Hello.  That's pretty sweet movie to be in, though.  Yeah.  You know it's going to do well.  I hope so, man.  It's got it.  It's going to do very well.  It's one of those that the parents can take the kids to,  but the parents aren't going to be both bored.  No, there's definitely some adult humor in there.  I want to bring it back to, I think you were on our show, like, I'm going to say three years ago. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Must have been for I Love You, Man, maybe?  Yeah.  And the only reason I bring it up is because we were talking about the Muppets three years ago with you.  I've been writing this thing for four years.  Yeah.  Ever since Forgetting Sarah Marshall, where there was that lavish puppet musical.  Wow.  I then went on to do the Muppet movie.  Ah.  Yeah, but it's a...  Did you pitch it, and then they said no, and you just kept writing,  or did you, like, say, I'm not going to pitch it until I'm finished writing it?  I pitched it, and they said yes, and then it was just trying to get everyone on board,  because it's a huge legacy to honor.  You know, it's not like characters I'm creating, and so... 
[01:27:30]  Well, that's what I'm amazed about.  Who did you pitch it to?  To Disney.  To Disney.  So they own the Muppets.  They own the Muppets, and it wasn't the same Muppets that we grew up with.  You know, it became sort of a watered-down kids franchise,  and the Muppets were dangerous when we were young.  You know, they always felt like they might bubble over at any minute,  and so the first Muppet pilot was called Muppet Sex and Violence,  because he wanted to separate it from the Sesame Street characters,  and I wanted to bring it back to those Muppets.  Ah, so it's a reboot. 
[01:28:00]  I guess it's just...  I know people don't like using that word in the industry these days, the reboot.  Yeah, but we're not trying to reinvent anything.  We're more trying to harken back to those late 70s, early 80s Muppets.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I like that you acknowledged in the movie that no one cares about the Muppets anymore.  I mean, and that...  There's a funny angle to take on it.  Yeah, absolutely, where, you know, a lot of years have gone by,  and whatever happened to the Muppets, and...  That was a big point of contention.  Really?  That's part of the four years, is...  You know, there was a lot of ego involved in them saying, you know, like, 
[01:28:30]  well, we haven't gone anywhere, we've been doing internet videos and things like that,  and I get the point, but I thought it was important, like,  there's nothing more exciting than a comeback movie.  And to come back, you have to have gone away.  So, I decided to shine a light on that they haven't been at the forefront.  Which I thought was funny.  How'd you finally get them to bend on it?  I announced it on television.  They hadn't...  The movie wasn't greenlit, and I went on Craig Ferguson, and I said, 
[01:29:00]  and I've just found out that we're making the new Muppet movie,  and there was a wild round of applause,  and so it was just like a chess move.  It was like, someone's gonna look dumb.  Either me or you guys.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Wow.  Balls!  See, that's a great Hollywood story.  Like, I would do that, and then I would have to retract it the next day,  and go, like, I'm sorry.  There won't be a Muppet movie.  I mean, I've made a terrible mistake, and I was showering with children.  There will be one, and I won't be in it, I meant to say.  Yeah, exactly.  You would be just sued for everything you have.  I would be sued, exactly. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  What a ballsy move.  I had nothing to lose at that point.  Of course not.  You want to explain the movie, just to get the basics out?  Yeah, sure.  It's about some brothers from small town,  me and my brother, who happens to be a puppet named Walter,  and my girlfriend, Amy Adams.  We decide to come to Los Angeles to meet the Muppets,  because my brother's a giant Muppet fan.  And when we get here, we find out that the Muppets studios are now decrepit,  and the Muppets aren't really famous anymore.  They're spread out throughout the world.  And the studio's going to be torn down by an evil oil baron, 
[01:30:00]  played by Chris Cooper, who raps in this movie, which is hilarious.  I like the rap.  Yeah, me too.  You used the word cheddar.  Yeah, we did.  I used that on the show just so I could see him at it.  Yeah, he's got more cheddar than some super-sized nachos, I think is his line.  But so we have to get the Muppets back together and put on a show to raise enough money to save the studio.  Chris Cooper is great.  He's amazing.  He takes it so seriously, too.  Like, you understand why a guy has an Academy Award and I don't. 
[01:30:30]  He came in even for the Muppet movie and was like,  I've been preparing for this hip-hop number.  There's a lot of really talented people out there,  a lot of talented young men I've been learning from.  He's like, he's method.  He was art.  A lot of cameos in the movie, too.  Yeah, yeah.  We got everybody.  We didn't have to make many outgoing calls.  I think for young comedians, Muppets are sort of your gateway into comedy.  It leads to, like, Monty Python and to Saturday Night Live.  So people were turning out in droves to be in the movie. 
[01:31:00]  Including Mickey Rooney.  Yeah.  Oh, is Rooney in it?  Whoa.  I don't want to give all the cameos away.  How is he to work with?  He's awesome, man.  He comes from, like, the old-style studio system.  Yeah, yeah.  Because at the end of the movie, they were like, you know, and that's a wrap.  And then he said, before I go, I would like to thank Disney  for all of the great films that it makes.  Not only this one, but the ones that it'll make in the future.  Just the old-school Hollywood guy.  Yeah.  Who do you say it to?  Just like the crew. 
[01:31:30]  The crew's like, all right, come on, we've got to move along.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's great.  That's how you get a career that lasts 60 years, though.  That's right.  He's smart.  He's politically a smart guy.  I would just walk off like fucking too cool for the room guy and never get invited back.  And Mickey gave Jimmy a talking to, so.  I met him briefly with his wife.  And, you know, someone told him I was a comedian.  We said hello.  I think his manager knew me.  And he goes, give me a joke quick.  And I'm like, ah, look, you wouldn't like my stuff.  I'm garbage. 
[01:32:00]  I told him I was garbage.  And he goes, no, you've got to work clean.  Don't use dirty language.  He really scolded me.  Yeah.  Like yourself.  What are you talking about?  You said that prior to?  Nothing worth the same, obviously.  But no, he was all right.  He's just a little old man.  He's old school, yeah.  He comes from a different era.  He's a Bob Hope vibe type guy.  Yeah, totally.  You know what was great is that he does come from the old, like, let's put on a show kind of era.  And that's what the whole movie was about.  Like, they were a good fit.  Yeah, absolutely.  You're putting on a show.  Yeah.  Was he good at it?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, he has a very brief cameo, but he's good. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  It was very brief.  It's always nice to get a guy like that to come back and do some weird shit you wouldn't expect to see.  Yeah, absolutely.  Especially when I'm available.  Oh, Jimmy.  Who wrote the musical numbers?  That was Britt McKenzie from Flight of the Conchords.  Damn.  Yeah.  There were some great songs in there.  They were a perfect match because they're very Muppety.  You know, they're like two wide-eyed innocents making their way through tough New York.  Right.  It's kind of like what the Muppets are like.  Never mean to anybody.  And James Boban, who directed the film, directed Flight of the Conchords. 
[01:33:00]  So it was perfect.  I also told you down the hall, I liked how you mocked some of the stereotypical things Hollywood does.  Yeah.  I thought that was really smart and clever.  Part of the idea is that Hollywood has passed the Muppets by and we've entered a new, more cynical world of comedy.  The most popular show on television right now in the movie is a show called Punch Teacher.  It's a game show where if kids get questions right, they get to punch their teacher in the face.  Not too far-fetched.  I know, I know.  It's a sad state of affairs. 
[01:33:30]  How much of a pain in the ass is it working those Muppets?  Still the same old way they do it?  Any CGI?  No, no CGI.  CGI Muppets.  Wow.  Yeah, we tried to go back to the original form, but yeah, it's a pain.  You have to build all the sets like six feet high and there's these poor puppeteers.  If I'm doing a scene next to a puppet on a couch, there's a puppeteer under that couch for hours and hours like in this weird contorted position.  It's pretty crazy.  Getting no recognition whatsoever.  That's the thing, man, is that these guys' job ultimately is to be invisible. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And in the meantime, they're like, the guy who plays Kermit is the most talented guy ever.  The guy who plays Piggy also plays Fozzie Bear and Animal.  Like in any other context, that's like a Peter Sellers-esque performance in a movie.  No, it was.  It's now a guy called Eric Jacobson.  Okay.  But he's playing three huge parts in the same movie that are totally different and you don't know his name.  And you forget they're puppets after a while.  That's how well they do it, if that makes sense.  No, suspension of disbelief kicks in really quickly. 
[01:34:30]  You don't feel like someone is just maneuvering a puppet after a while.  No, well, these guys are the best of the best.  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.  You should see a kid come to set.  They look right at the puppet's eyes, even though a puppeteer is standing right there.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It's really sweet.  You forced me to sit through the credits.  I don't sit through credits in movies.  I'll be honest with you.  But the whistling scene?  Yeah.  We know a guy, his name is Steve the Whistler.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  And he's obsessed with whistling.  He's won international competitions.  He brags about it.  He's been on our show.  He's had CDs out.  He's an ass.  He's kind of an ass.  Right.  And I'm like, oh my God, I think he finally got his big break.  So I sat to see who the Whistler was.  It wasn't Steve the Whistler.  No, it wasn't.  No, I'd remember.  With a name like the Whistler, what choice did he have?  But this guy won all the competitions.  He was, for a while, the number one Whistler in the world.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a pretty serious last whistling number, I must say. 
[01:35:30]  I don't know how the fuck they do that.  Had a Muppet to whistle.  Or why?  Huh?  Very hard for a Muppet to whistle.  Well, yeah.  We had to build a special Muppet.  Yes, very dry.  Very dry mouth.  Yeah, exactly.  Hard to wet your whistle.  Jimmy can whistle.  He's pretty good at it.  I've been obsessed with it my whole life, and I can't do it.  It's horrible.  Yeah, I just make air come out.  It's a gift.  To whistle is a gift.  To whistle is a gift.  It's a bumper sticker.  So basically what you're doing is breathing.  Yeah.  Watch.  See?  It's terrible.  You're farting out of your mouth.  Yeah.  That's all it is.  Really.  I don't know how to do it. 
[01:36:00]  I really don't.  I would like to be taught.  That's how I'd get girls to kiss me.  I'd ask them to teach me to whistle, and they'd pucker up.  I'd stick my tongue in their mouth and make an angry face.  It's romantic.  I know.  I'm a creep.  That's a PG rating.  Yeah, it's like a true family film.  So there's some stuff in there that's, yeah, for the adults.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's for, well, there's this weird thing where family movies have become synonymous with  like children's entertainment.  But this is like truly what the Muppets were like.  They're for everybody.  It's what The Simpsons has done great. 
[01:36:30]  And things like Pixar, like Toy Story 3.  That movie, parents are crying harder than kids are by the end of that movie.  Hopefully this is like that.  Through your tears.  Yeah.  Amy Adams, her name is?  Yeah.  Wow.  She's a looker.  Lovely.  Oh my God.  Yeah, she is.  And she's like, she's the Meryl Streep of our generation, man.  She can do anything.  Oh, she's that good?  Well, when you think of The Fighter versus Enchanted versus Muppets, I mean, it's insane.  That's three completely different roles.  Who is she in The Fighter?  Oh yeah, it's the girl.  She's the girlfriend. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, right.  She's great.  She got nominated for an Academy Award for that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Remember the scene where she's showing off a little booty behind the bar?  I do.  Yes.  Jason goes, I do.  I do.  I saw her recently in a magazine.  I'm like, who is that?  I didn't realize she was the girl from The Fighter.  Yeah.  She can do anything.  Yeah.  She's really hot.  And she's buttoned up in this movie.  She sings and dances.  Yeah.  She's sweet.  We play like total wide-eyed innocence.  Triple threat.  Yeah.  She's a triple threat.  That's right.  She is.  That's what they call that.  Did you get to kiss her in the movie?  I did.  That's nice.  Yeah, but it's a very PG-style kiss. 
[01:37:30]  Oh yeah, of course.  When you do a scene with a girl where you get to kiss her, is there a weird attachment?  Because a lot of people hook up after movies.  Right.  Do you develop it?  I haven't been that lucky.  No?  No.  No, they have no interest whatsoever.  I'm like the lovable, goofy guy in a movie.  That guy gets the girl.  But in real life, that guy doesn't get the girl.  The dangerous guy gets the girl.  Every time.  The guy that gets blown off in the movie because he's such an ass.  Yeah, he gets the girl.  But he's dangerous.  Yeah, he doesn't get the girl in the movie. 
[01:38:00]  In real life, he gets the girl.  The geeky guy gets it because the girl realizes, this guy has feelings for me and he's not so  superficial.  Real life, totally the opposite.  It's so true.  Dickhead gets girl.  Always.  Yeah.  Always.  Yeah.  The movie reality comes from the brain of dorky comedy writers.  Right.  Yeah.  The way they would like it to be.  It's like their fantasy, yeah.  Was there anything you wanted to do in this that they wouldn't let you do?  Uh, no, I got to do quite a bit.  I got to sing and dance.  I wanted to do like an MGM style old lavish musical number and I got to do two or three 
[01:38:30]  of them.  Busby Berkeley.  Yeah, exactly.  Like singing in the rain style.  Just, you know, where...  From clockwork, you mean?  I like the kind of musical numbers from like the 50s and before that make no sense.  Right.  Where all of a sudden like the whole town is singing and dancing and people are on stilts.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, stilts.  But...  That is ridiculous.  But what you got to watch out for in this movie, the twist at the end of that, that's  what made me howl.  When you guys like jumped on the bus because there's time for you to leave and the town 
[01:39:00]  is still there after their musical number.  And then they all just...  A little awkward.  They all collapse in exhaustion.  Yeah, I didn't know what you wanted to give up on the film.  Yeah, that's fine.  But all of a sudden like, oh, thank God they're finally gone.  Yeah, we kind of acknowledge how silly that stuff is, but I got to do a bit of everything.  I got to puppeteer, I got to puppeteer Animal and Dr. Teeth at one point.  Is it hard or is it as easy as I think it is?  What I had to do was very easy.  Like I just had to make sure the puppet looked alive.  But what Steve Whitmire does is Kermit is crazy. 
[01:39:30]  That's a sock puppet.  That's a sock puppet in essence.  And he can make it have any expression that a human can have.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really crazy.  Crumbling up the mouth a little bit.  Yeah, when you can make Kermit look wistful.  I mean, it's just like, I don't even know how to describe it.  He's been doing it for years.  He's the master.  He's the guy who's been doing it the whole time?  He took over from Jim Henson when Jim Henson died.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's where Henson, I forgot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe we're fast-forwarding too quickly here, but maybe more movies or? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I mean, I'm superstitious, so I just want to see how this one goes.  Yeah, and I kind of think like my goal was to set the platform for the Muppets to do whatever they wanted.  I'd love to see the old Muppet show come back.  I mean, that was odd.  I remember those Saturday nights sitting down and watching the Muppet show with my parents.  That was the coolest.  But whatever they want to do, you know, I fancy myself like a footnote in this legacy.  I've been told I look like a sock puppet by Bob Kelly, so I think that if there is a Muppet sequel,  I should somehow be considered to be hired as some type of a creepy hybrid. 
[01:40:30]  That's just my opinion.  You're selling yourself now.  Of course I am.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just so it'll be in his head when he's writing the new one.  Like, where do I go with this?  Ah.  I see, we got Larry King outside the studio.  What?  We're in a weird spot here because Larry was supposed to be a little later, but he's got TV today.  Can we jump you over there and put Larry here?  Do you mind, Jason?  Do you mind?  Larry!  Thank you.  Larry.  You got it.  We'll keep talking about the movie.  Oh, of course.  Of course.  I'm good.  Larry.  Larry.  How are you, sir? 
[01:41:00]  Good to see you again, Larry.  Just saw you on the Don Imus program.  Yeah, I went over there.  Very good.  Yeah, I went over there.  You got to lower your standards.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  And so does Don.  Why?  Okay, goodbye.  Teasing, of course.  I love Larry King.  We had a good time last time you were in here, Larry.  Yeah, I remember.  You know Jason Segel?  Hello, nice to meet you, sir.  You wrote the movie?  I did, yeah.  Wrote and starred in.  You know, I knew Jim Henson.  Wow.  Real well.  You knew everybody.  I knew everybody.  Pretty much, yeah.  But the Muppets twice hosted Larry King Live. 
[01:41:30]  No way.  Kermit hosted it.  In fact, you want a quick story?  Funny radios.  Let a rip.  10-day story.  I don't know how this came about, but the Muppets were involved at the end.  We had a guy that worked at CNN, a producer.  He was a very nervous guy.  He's just uptight.  Good producer, but ooh.  So we had CNN International set up a call that he would call, and he got a call from the CIA. 
[01:42:00]  A real guy at the CIA that we knew, he was a good friend of the guy, Marty West, I think was.  He says, listen, I'm with the CIA, and can you come out and see me?  And don't tell anyone you're coming.  Interesting.  He says, okay, I'll go on.  He goes, he leaves, he drives up to McLean, Virginia.  His name is down on the bottom.  There really is this guy.  He goes up to the fifth floor, goes in the guy's office.  They lock the doors behind him.  The door's shut.  And he says, we're in a soundproof room, and what I'm saying to you is the first time that this information is leaving this building. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, JFK stuff.  Oh, boy.  No, no.  Any way you think.  He says, 40 years ago, we captured two aliens.  And they landed here in their spaceship, and they lived.  And over the past 40 years, we've trained them in ways, and we've taught them to speak English. 
[01:43:00]  And we want to break this next Monday on Larry Kane Live.  He says, you're kidding.  He says, you know, we think the Russians have a couple, and we want to get the beat on them.  So you have to go back to your studio.  Don't say anything to anyone, and you can start promoting it next Monday.  We'll deliver the two aliens to your studio.  The guy goes back.  He can't say anything, right?  He comes walking, and we all know about it.  He's biting his lower lip. 
[01:43:30]  He goes and locks his office and bangs him.  He's got the hottest thing in the history of television.  Of the world.  Of the world.  We're going to have two aliens who have been taught to speak English.  They look a little weird, but don't mind it.  And the next night, our guests are the Muppets.  That's hilarious.  But the guy's going crazy, right?  He's going to say.  So Kermit opens up the guys underneath the floor with Kermit, and they open up the door, 
[01:44:00]  and Kermit just says, how are the aliens doing?  Broke the guy's heart.  Yeah.  Humiliating.  Felt like an idiot.  That's amazing.  But they were great to work with.  I loved working with them when you had them as guests.  Jim Henson first, and then who replaced him?  Steve Whitmire became Kermit, yeah, who's a genius as well.  Because when you interviewed them, they're sitting down there with the hand.  So you're looking at Kermit, and you look down, and you see him, and he's looking at  a monitor. 
[01:44:30]  And in two minutes, he's Kermit.  That's the truth.  In two minutes, the guy ain't there.  Even though he's there.  Right.  You see his hand.  So who are you looking at?  You're looking at Kermit.  You're looking at the puppet.  Yeah, right in the eyes.  Or you've got to do it if you lower your eye.  Right.  You see the guy, but you're not focused on him.  But it was brilliant.  Oh, Kermit hosted the show once, and they had me call in.  I was out at the Barber Sinatra Children's Center, and he hung up on me.  As well as he should have. 
[01:45:00]  You wore those braces.  Get him off.  Get him off.  That's hilarious.  I could see Larry asking Kermit the hard-hitting questions.  Yeah, I did.  You weren't throwing softballs at him.  I was tough on Kermit.  Yeah.  Well, Larry, just so you know, I saw the new Muppets movie, and terrific.  Jason did a great job with the whole thing.  Thank you.  He really did.  You know, see, I'm back to interviewing mode.  Go.  Of course.  What's the toughest job of making a movie when you've got hands and guys running puppets?  I asked that already.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you. 
[01:45:30]  I'll give you the real answer.  Something is such.  I said, why do I have to do those two guys at Freak Street?  There's something about, like, you can imagine anything.  And so you can imagine writing a scene where ten full-body Muppets run away from an exploding building.  I wrote that scene, and then we got there, and the director was like, well, how do you plan on doing this?  I said, I didn't think that was my job.  I thought that was your job.  So we had to rewrite the scene, and instead we just show half-body Muppets running away from behind.  And then you hear an explosion, and Fozzie goes, wow, that was an expensive-looking explosion. 
[01:46:00]  That's how we handle problems like that.  Kind of a goof.  It was really good.  It worked.  I remember that television show, The Muppet Show?  Oh, yeah.  I was a guest once.  Who was the bear?  Fozzie.  Fozzie.  Fozzie.  Well, Fozzie, I'm the guest of the day on their show.  And the whole scheme, I never got into the show, because Fozzie, Fozzie, right?  Yeah.  He was outside manning the door.  And I come up, and I said, hi, I'm on the show today.  And what's your name? 
[01:46:30]  Larry King.  I got King Kong.  I don't have any Larry King.  I said, but I'm on the show.  I'm sorry, man.  You ain't on the show.  I never got in.  That was the whole game.  That was the whole game.  This is why Larry King is great, though, because we're talking about the Muppets, and you walk  in out of the blue with 15 minutes of great Muppet stories.  I know.  That's really unbelievable.  He's got stories about anything.  You've been around as long as I have, and to have known Jim Henson, he started in Washington,  D.C. 
[01:47:00]  And his first job, I think, as Kermit, was he did breaks between shows.  Kermit would come on and do like two minutes of break.  You watch this, and now this is coming.  And then he formed the whole Muppets, and he died terrible.  Yeah.  That was a real tragedy.  The virus killed him in a weekend.  Yeah, yeah.  That was fast.  He got it on Thursday.  He was dead Sunday.  Damn.  He was healthy Wednesday?  Yeah.  Well, Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday afternoon.  That's scary stuff right there.  How would he pick up on healthy Wednesday?  Well, no. 
[01:47:30]  I didn't know if he was sick.  Yeah, he was healthy.  He was a completely healthy guy.  Got this virus dead by Sunday.  He didn't believe in antibiotics.  It was a bacterial infection.  He didn't believe in antibiotics.  At that point, you believe in that stuff.  Bizarre, right?  Well, they're true.  Yeah.  Yes.  They're not a myth.  They exist.  They're very true.  They do work.  I got to tell you my favorite Larry King moment, because I've always wanted to ask you about  this, was when you interviewed Brando, who, to me, was a really, really tough interview.  Oh, I loved him.  But you handled him really, really well. 
[01:48:00]  Well, it's a great story, the Brando story.  We get a call from, CNN calls me.  I was in L.A., and they said, listen, you're not going to believe this, but Marlon Brando  has agreed to do your show.  It's the only show he'll do, and he's going to do it Friday night, and this was Tuesday.  But he wants Kermit to host.  Yes.  He wants to call you first.  He wants to talk to you.  And normally, I didn't like that.  I didn't like talking to guests before a show, because I like everything cold, but it's Marlon  Brando.  So I was at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and the phone rings, and I figure out, hello, and 
[01:48:30]  he says, Larry, it's Marlon.  I swear to God, I said, Marlon who?  And he innocently said, Brando, you know, because there was Marlon Fitzwater.  He was the presidential press secretary.  So he says, listen, I'd like to talk to you before we do this.  I've agreed to do this.  I'm going to send a car and come up to my house and have lunch.  I said, okay.  So I go downstairs.  I'm waiting at the Wilshire entrance, and a car pulls up, and Brando's driving.  Oh, wow. 
[01:49:00]  It was just an ordinary Chevy.  We get in the car, and we start driving around Beverly Hills, just driving, doing songs.  Wow.  He would do the first line.  I would do the second line.  Like, he says, someday, when I'm awfully low, then I would have to do it.  And the world was cold.  I'm driving around.  I'm saying to myself, I'm driving around.  I'm singing songs in Beverly Hills.  Then he says, well, what are we going to talk about?  I said, well, we'll talk about acting.  Ah, acting is easy. 
[01:49:30]  Acting is easy to talk about.  And anybody can act.  Talk about other things.  Talk about architecture.  Talk about life.  Architecture.  Oh, he was very interested in architecture.  He was designing foolproof earthquake buildings.  Probably for his floors.  He said to me, I said, I'll prove to you anyone can act.  And he pulls over to the side of the road, and he looks at me and says, your brother died.  And I said, what?  And he says, now, hold that what.  That was a great what. 
[01:50:00]  That was a great what.  Now, if we could put a camera on top of this car, dolly it into your face.  When I say your brother died, you do that what?  Supporting actor.  Wow.  I mean, he was just.  But he was.  I had a wonderful time with him.  We were up at his house.  You were singing in the interview, too.  I didn't realize where that came from.  And then he kissed me.  Yeah.  And that was what went viral around the world.  Last night, they showed it.  I got honored last night at the Friars here.  Nice.  And it was really nice.  Did Colin Quinn give you a beating? 
[01:50:30]  Because I saw Colin yesterday.  He was funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were funny.  But when they put up the Brando thing, and I keep remembering, so I'm always asking, what  was it like to be kissed?  And what I say, I do a comedy act.  I go it around.  In fact, let me get this mentioned.  Yes.  On February 2nd, I will be in Stamford, Connecticut at the Palace Theater.  And on February 4th, I'll be at the Brooklyn Center for Performing Arts.  I do 80 minutes, tell stories.  Wow.  I just tell stories.  I like making people laugh. 
[01:51:00]  I've been telling stories all my life.  I was a class comic.  So now that I don't have to work at CNN every night, I just like telling stories.  You're enjoying it, huh?  Oh, I'm enjoying it.  Good for you.  Enjoying it.  So people say, one of the first questions they ask is, what was it like to be kissed?  I take audience questions at the end.  Kissed by my own brand.  I said, well, I've never been kissed by a man in my life.  You know, I was raised, I'm heterosexual.  I don't know why I'm heterosexual, by the way.  I'm just heterosexual.  He's missing out, Larry.  Well, I don't mention that in San Francisco. 
[01:51:30]  Certain parts of Houston, I think.  Houston, the hotbed.  But Brando kissed me, and I have to confess.  I can't stop thinking about it.  The other night, I woke up screaming, it's Stella, and I don't know what to say.  And then he came on the show.  This is funny.  Now he comes on again a year later, and this time he's coming to the studio, and he was  angry or something.  He said, I want to come on.  Now he wants second base. 
[01:52:00]  Now he comes on, and he's angry at Jews in Hollywood.  What?  Because they don't book enough minorities in movies.  American Indians, Latinos don't get enough shots in movies.  And he says, and you know, the Jews, and he loved Jewish people.  He loved Yiddish, and he loved people.  But he said it wrong.  He said, you know, the Jews really control this industry.  Oh, boy.  Didn't he say they don't portray the kike?  That was the big type. 
[01:52:30]  He said that.  He said that about the stereotype of the Jew they don't portray as they do the Dago or this  and that.  And I think that was the big quote.  And who lost him and got mad at him, and he had to go visit Rabbi Weir.  Wow.  I apologize.  All that.  But the crazy thing about Rabbi Weir, afterwards, you know, he never goes out.  So we finished the show, and I said, he said, where are you going?  And I said, I'm going to this restaurant, you know, busy restaurant.  He says, I'll go with you.  Okay, so he had his own car, and I had a car.  So we drove to this restaurant.  As soon as we got there, there's 8,000 paparazzi. 
[01:53:00]  This guy's up in trees.  I don't know how they found out he was going.  And we just got another there, followed him.  And in the restaurant, we had, like, 12 people having dinner.  Wow.  So he became, like, the 13th.  Gloria Allred, you know, Gloria Allred.  Oh, she's lovely.  Oh, yeah.  Jumped on his lap.  Really?  Gloria Allred jumped on his lap.  He was feeding people.  He was feeding people.  And he was observing people.  And I saw what made him a great actor.  He said, I see the maid of D. 
[01:53:30]  He's unhappy.  And how can you tell?  Look at the way he walks.  Look at the way he's walking that guy at a table.  See that little walk?  He don't like it.  See that couple?  They're going to break up.  How do you know?  He's looking at her, but not at her.  He's looking a little over her shoulder.  It's just the observation.  I wonder if he was right or he's just babbling.  Yeah, we don't know.  We don't know if that's right.  But the proof is he was so good, though, so he must have had an intuition of the people. 
[01:54:00]  He was good at reading people is what you're saying.  So I go to bed, and it's 2 in the morning, and he calls up, and he says, hey, Larry, let's  get down to Mexico.  I got Sean Penn here.  We'll fly down to Mexico.  I'll have some laughs.  I'm a Jewish kid from Brooklyn.  It's 2 o'clock in the morning.  We have the Jewish kids from Brooklyn.  They're not flying down to Mexico.  And he calls back.  He says, Sean Penn.  We can't go.  Sean Penn don't have his passport.  But he lived there.  I went to his memorial service.  It was a wonderful service.  Carl Malden told stories about Brando.  I genuinely liked him a lot. 
[01:54:30]  Did Carl Malden like him?  Because I think Rod Steiger...  Hated him.  He did, right?  Because he hated Steiger, too.  He thought he was a terrible actor.  Well, the problem with Steiger had is in one of the greatest scenes ever in On the Waterfront  is the scene in the back of the car when Brando says, I could have been somebody.  He didn't say champion.  I love that line.  I could have been a contender.  Didn't say champion.  He could have been a contender.  Charlie.  Charlie was his brother. 
[01:55:00]  You let me down, Charlie.  You let me down.  And then Steiger would answer back to him sitting in the back of the car.  And what Steiger pissed at was when Brando did his lines, Steiger fed him the lines back.  And they do the two-shot thing, right?  When Steiger did his lines, Brando didn't sit there.  Oh, he didn't know it was off camera.  Someone else threw the lines out.  Well, Jay Moore told the story that he heard.  Steiger never forgot that.  Wow.  Was that what Brando, I heard, didn't like Steiger?  And he said he used... 
[01:55:30]  There was a moment where he goes, oh, Charlie.  And they said that Brando said his motivation for that moment was how horrible he thought Steiger's acting was.  Like, oh, rock.  Like, that was what he motivated.  He thought he was terrible.  He liked Karl Malden.  Malden didn't like him.  Loved him.  Really?  Loved Malden.  Tells stories about Streetcar, which made Malden famous with Streetcar on Broadway.  And Malden, of course, was the best friend.  And there was a scene where they're sitting at the breakfast table on stage. 
[01:56:00]  And Malden put his hands under the leg and did those two fingers in the top of the knee.  You ever had that done to you?  Yeah.  You can't not jump through the ceiling.  And Brando put a cigarette out in Malden's head.  And they kept on talking.  That's great.  Wow.  And neither one of them broke?  Neither broke.  Wow.  That's a great story.  And Malden had one scene where he walks on stage and it ain't his scene. 
[01:56:30]  He just came on stage.  And the actors are talking.  So all he did was say, Stella, you got a cigarette?  And he took the cigarette and walked away.  That's great.  Wow.  What a set of balls.  What do you think that is?  Just to kind of keep everybody alert and keep it real?  I think he was just, he rewrote, when I talked, I don't want to name it up.  Al Pacino has become a great friend of mine.  And I talked to Al a lot about acting.  He has great acting stories.  Al.  What's he been in?  He's the best.  Yeah.  He's in this new one. 
[01:57:00]  The Adam Sandler one.  That's supposed to make him famous.  I don't know.  He chases the girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He said he loved that script.  And Al's a great, but when Al talks about Marlon, when he did Godfather, Marlon made him nervous.  Marlon had him talk to him because he made him, just made him nervous being around him.  You know, he actually, physically, it was so imposing.  It was so scary.  And this was Al's first year.  He had made one movie.  A Panic in Needle Park. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, Panic in.  And now he was doing this.  Wow.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, that's got to be intimidating.  Because he had such a weird way, it seemed, of talking about actors.  Like, anybody can act.  Like, he was so dismissive of this thing that they make so big.  He made actors mad.  Jane Fonda got very bad at him for dismissing acting.  He says, well, he'd rather read the play.  He said that?  Why don't you just read the play?  I cannot get enough of Marlon Brando's shit-talking story.  He's the greatest thing ever. 
[01:58:00]  He's the greatest.  The dismissiveness that he...  He did his own makeup that night at the house.  He served wine to the whole crew.  We had a big crew up there.  The cameramen.  He had hors d'oeuvres.  What an eclectic guy.  Oh, he was a wonderful, wonderful host.  Yeah.  He was a great dancer.  Really?  Oh, could he move around?  He was a dancer.  He came to New York as a dancer from Omaha with a dance troupe. 
[01:58:30]  And then he got into the acting school here.  Ah, no kidding.  Yeah.  Invented method.  They're telling us you got a hard out.  Yeah, at age 25.  You got a busy day, huh?  Yeah, Larry's busy today.  They're telling us.  We would love to have you stay.  I want you here.  I got to go do a show called The Chew.  The Chew?  It's a television show with Mario Bertaldi, the chef.  Oh, right.  Oh.  That was an Asian man.  Yes.  I don't know how to make it English.  Well, I don't know what I'm going to do. 
[01:59:00]  I want to plug you there, too.  You sure it wasn't The Chew?  I was just thinking of that.  Can I ask Larry a quick question?  Shoot it up.  Shoot it up.  This is anti-Semitic.  That was anti-Semitic.  No, it wasn't.  I take that part of it.  The Chew is Jewish, and you would be on the show called The Jew.  All right.  Let me tell you where I'm doing my stand-up.  Well, Larry's done with us.  I want me to do this.  I can do this.  I would like to.  I was going to do it for you, but if you'd rather do it.  Here's where I'm doing my stand-up, folks.  You'll come and have a good time.  I would absolutely go.  Enjoy the frolic here.  There's 80 minutes of this.  I would absolutely go.  80 minutes of this.  February 2nd, I'm at the Palace Theater in Stamford, Connecticut, home of Jackie Robinson. 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  Stamford, Connecticut Palace Theater, February 2nd, and then Larry King standing up at the  Whitman Hall of Brooklyn College.  It's the Brooklyn Center of Performing Arts, and that's on February 4th.  February 2nd, Stamford, February 4th in Brooklyn, and you can call the box office for information.  Do you have more free time doing this than you did with CNN?  I've been speaking.  The weird part, I've got to run, but I've been speaking all over the world.  Wow. 
[02:00:00]  I've been in Kazakhstan.  Wow.  Slovakia, Moscow, Portugal, Korea, Mexico City.  Wow.  Jersey?  Maybe.  Jersey's harder to get there.  More dangerous.  Right after Thanksgiving, I'm speaking in Kiev.  I'm big in Kiev.  I love their chickens.  Well, it's downtown.  Downtown Kiev.  Downtown Kiev.  They love this.  You're happening?  Yeah.  I want to ask you, but we ran out of time.  Well, quick.  Maybe a quick question. 
[02:00:30]  Were you ever nervous on CNN interviewing somebody?  No.  You never got nervous?  The only time I was ever nervous was my first day on the air, and all I did was admit it.  But no one...  I said it was my first day on the air.  I was never nervous again because...  You owned it.  No, I realized that old cliche, it ain't brain surgery.  It's true.  Right.  See this, what we're doing now?  Yeah.  I don't know how to break this to you, Jay.  Yeah.  This is nothing?  Don't happen with this.  This is nothing.  No, no, no.  This will go into the atmosphere and be gone. 
[02:01:00]  Brain surgery.  This isn't even clipping a cuticle.  This is nothing.  There was a great cartoon in the New Yorker once of doctors in the operating room, and  they're the guy with the skull, and they're about to do brain surgery, and one doctor  says to the other, it ain't television.  New Yorker.  Thanks, guys.  I'll see you guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nice to meet you, sir.  I can't wait to see the movie.  Thank you.  It's a pleasure.  It opens the day before Thanksgiving, November 23rd.  It'll do no business.  Yes, exactly.  It's going to be a monster movie for Jason.  Thanks, guys.  Larry, thanks so much.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you, sir.  Any other anti-Semitic remark? 
[02:01:30]  No, no.  No anti-Semitism.  It's all in good fun.  I just hit all the rap openings.  Yeah.  All right, Larry and Jim are getting a picture.  Did we get a picture of that?  Oh, I got last time, yeah.  Did we get a picture of that?  We got Bob Costas with his head photo.  Oh, yeah.  We had a good interview last night, Larry.  You'd be proud.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Take care, Larry.  Beat it.  Let's get...  Larry.  He was great.  Hit the bricks, Larry.  What an interesting guy.  You don't want Larry on our show anymore?  No.  I've just...  You took a few...  Larry can take...  A few shots. 
[02:02:00]  Larry can take it.  Oh, my God.  I thought he was...  I thought he was joking.  Larry's a fun, old-school guy.  He does comedy.  He tells funny stories.  He's a little...  He's a little, you know...  We got in trouble for the chew...  thing with...  What's his name?  Ben Stein.  Ben Stein.  I just listened to that the other day,  and I'm like,  he's going down the same road again.  No.  They're telling us that Jason has to go, too.  You got to go, too.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  But...  Do we promote it enough?  I hope so.  Yeah.  Larry King talking about the Muppets.  That was great.  We had a good 15 minutes of Larry King talking Muppets. 
[02:02:30]  It was pretty amazing.  We like you.  We want to make sure you're all right.  Thanks.  No, it goes to show the history of the Muppets.  I mean, they've been around for 40 years.  There's a reason they've endured for so long.  So, hopefully, they're back, yeah, next Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving.  Next?  Oh, man.  That's huge.  I highly recommend it, especially for the families there.  I really...  We all enjoyed it, so...  And it's a weekend.  You're with your family, and so it'll be two hours.  You guys don't have to talk to each other.  That's true, yeah.  You can just sit there together in silence, which is always nice.  Oh, really fast.  The Toy Story short that I saw yesterday? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  That's part of it?  That's in front of the movie as well.  So, we got the Toy Story characters back right in front of it as well.  Wow, that's huge.  They got a little Toy Story short.  Yeah.  Brand new.  Making everyone happy.  Like old times, where you used to show a cartoon before the movies.  That's right.  You got it.  Ah, back in the 30s.  All right, Jason.  Please don't be a stranger.  We like when you're on the show.  Yeah, thanks, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be back soon.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, congratulations.  You just joined Twitter.  Yeah, I did just join Twitter.  Putting us all to shame.  I don't know.  He gets a quarter million followers in the first two hours or something.  Yeah.  Just something ridiculous.  Enjoy the assholes who are all critics. 
[02:03:30]  Exactly.  It's pretty amazing.  And they're also like, you got to feed the machine.  They want to know where you are and what you're doing every couple hours.  It's like specifically the reason I don't have a girlfriend.  Get used to that block button, by the way.  Don't be afraid of using it.  Yeah, no.  You're not going to use it at first, but you're going to wear that button out.  You'll get people to benefit the doubt.  Within a few weeks, you're going to be like, fuck this guy.  Yeah.  People are so excited about the Muppets, though.  They keep writing how excited they are to see it.  So, hopefully, it'll work out.  Jason Siegel on Twitter.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  We're going to take a break, too, right? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, hit it.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like, through,  you know, the air satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever.  Here's the thing.  But, I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really... 
[02:04:30]  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  Oh.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but, like, I mean, did you get into your router  settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right there.  Yeah, exactly right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that? 
[02:05:00]  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, what, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean, like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet cable?  Yeah, they call them...  I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need, like, a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just...  Let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay? 
[02:05:30]  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that...  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine.  I'm up to my limit of friends. 
[02:06:00]  I'm not helping with Facebook.  I think somebody sent up a fan page.  I'm hanging up!  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests.  Sirius XM.  The Opium Anthony Show.  Uh.  All right, wow. 
[02:06:30]  I want to thank Jason Segel for the Muppets movie, and of course, Larry King.  That whole thing worked out nicely, huh?  Gotta love the Larry King.  Let me publicly apologize for anything negative I've ever said about Larry King.  About Sandusky?  Oh.  No, no, no.  I won't apologize for that.  You get in the shower, you get what's coming to you.  Oh, dude, we turned the corner on him.  He was amazing.  I guess you were...  Oh, you did tell us.  Yeah.  You were out doing Leno.  Doing a little show you may have heard of called The Tonight Show. 
[02:07:00]  Ah.  And it was me and Ant, and we completely turned the corner.  We interviewed Larry and went, fuck, this guy is awesome.  Love the Larry.  He could talk about...  I would literally want to go see him when he's in Brooklyn.  Right.  He could talk about anything.  We actually also, Jimmy, so you know, that first interview, we called him out on some  of the things he did say on CNN that we goofed on.  Oh, I know.  I heard it.  And he went with it.  Yeah.  And we're like, fuck, this guy's really cool.  Yeah.  But he talked to, I think, Roland Pointer at one of Diana's last interviews, the president's 
[02:07:30]  like, he interviewed fucking everybody.  You could bring up, as he proved here, you could bring up any subject, any topic, anything  in history, and he'll have a story.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember.  I was with LBJ, and we...  What?  I was with everybody.  We're not worthy to interview Larry King when you know who he has interviewed over the  years.  I know.  Are you kidding me?  It is something.  Yeah, we interviewed Stalker Patty and Bobo.  Exactly.  That's great, too, that he didn't just fucking, you know, retire and stay in his house to,  you know, wither away. 
[02:08:00]  The guy's out there doing shit.  He didn't want to leave CNN.  Let's, uh...  Well, that's just it.  Let's keep it honest.  That's just it.  You know, usually when that happens, people just go home, and, uh, you know, that's the  last you ever see of him.  He comes back and does some CNN stuff, so we're in there.  Um...  I ate a gyro in front of you, because I treated myself...  You're treating you again?  ...at fucking five o'clock in the morning of the night, I ordered a gyro...  What?  ...from Big Nick's and fries and ate them all.  No!  You could order food at five in the morning?  It's your Big Nick's, yeah.  It's New York. 
[02:08:30]  Big Nick's stays open?  ...fucking 24-7, baby.  I did not know that.  No, and most of them close in our hood.  Uh, no, I know a few places that are open 24-7, as they say.  But, uh...  Eating...  Oh, that's terrible.  I know, and then I just pinched my fat and went, yuck.  Oh, it's just sitting there.  Do you eat all at your fat?  No.  I just hate it.  Oh, Jimmy.  Uh, and I hope we, uh, did Jason Segel, uh, a solid...  Dude, Larry can't even talk about the Muppets.  All right, good.  All right, good.  Good, good, good, good.  Jason's lucky.  Good, good, good. 
[02:09:00]  He's a big head, Jason.  A lot of stars have big heads.  Like, physically large skulls.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he doesn't have a big head in the other...  No, he's a nice dude.  ...in the other sense...  No, he's not arrogant.  ...of the word.  Uh, we got one more Sandusky clip from The Rock's, uh, new show, The Rock Center.  Why are you laughing?  I just think it's funny that The Rock has a new show.  Well, well, correct me then.  I see The Rock Center.  I don't know if there's a...  NBC has a show called The Rock Center.  The Rock Center.  You smell what The Rock is cooking. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  I didn't even hear him say once to Sandusky that it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter if you touch kids.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, that would be good.  Sam.  Did you touch kids?  It doesn't matter if you touch kids.  Sam, we're going to make a deal here, and you're going to be on the clock.  We don't like talking wrestling from 6 to 10.  Oh, that's a shit show.  And you don't like listening to it from 10 to 11.  But I know The Rock...  I know Raw was on.  I know E-Rock likes to live-tweet it, and you get involved, and I guess The Rock and  McFoley and a bunch of other people came back last night? 
[02:10:00]  Well, The Rock and McFoley did, yes, because Raw got rocked.  Oh.  Was The Rock promoting his new show on NBC, The Rock Center?  No.  Because I know how Vince will allow that to happen.  Raw got rocked.  Yeah, Raw got rocked.  It was a three-hour spectacular because...  Three hours?  That's right.  What the fuck do they need three hours for?  Three fucking hours?  Because The Rock is returning to wrestle at Survivor Series on Sunday.  That's good for a half hour.  Yes, he is.  No, he's not, by the way.  Yes, he is.  Wait, wait, wait.  He's wrestling.  Dwayne Johnson is now a movie star. 
[02:10:30]  Well...  He makes movies.  He cannot afford to bang up his face or get injured.  What he will do...  The Rock doesn't get banged up.  He does the banging.  He'll get in the ring.  Bounce off the ropes a couple of times.  Maybe do the people's elbow.  Listen.  You will not be wrestling.  You will not see any of these hardcore moves he used to do.  I'm going to tell you something.  Yes, sir.  At Survivor Series on Sunday, The Rock and John Cena are fighting The Awesome Truth.  Uh-huh.  The Miz and R-Truth.  At WrestleMania in March, it's The Rock and John Cena one-on-one. 
[02:11:00]  One-on-one.  Mano-mano.  We're talking about it too much.  How much is Vince paying fucking The Rock to do this?  I would assume a lot, but...  It has to be millions.  They are going to make a lot of money on this year's WrestleMania, though.  But The Rock is a massive movie star.  He can't...  If he gets an injury, he's fucking up his whole movie career.  He can't.  Luckily, The Rock does the smacking down.  You are such a dick.  So what did Mick Foley do?  Mick Foley caught The Rock bottom.  Jesus.  What?  What's he doing?  He did a segment called This Is Your Life, John Cena, which was like a throwback, because 
[02:11:30]  he once did This Is Your Life, Rock.  Well, when he came out, Mick Foley, was it music?  Oh, yeah.  What music?  It was his old Mick Foley music.  His old Mick Foley music.  Crowd response?  Loved him.  Were they going crazy?  They loved him.  Now, did they hear this and just go, ah!  Yes.  And then Mick comes out?  And Mick, he was wearing his flannel, and he had his arm in the air.  Oh, of course.  It does?  Oh, yeah.  And the crowd went, bullshit. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, they went crazy.  That's great.  It's just such idiotic.  It's such idiotic.  It really is.  Absolute idiotic.  I say good for Mick Foley.  I love Mick Foley.  But they are just a bunch of idiots.  Oh, it's absolute nonsense.  But then at the end of the segment, the Rock's music hit, which, I mean...  Oh, shit.  I mean, it...  Oh, and then did Mick look around?  Did Mick look around like, uh-oh!  Uh-oh!  Well, if you want to hear a reaction, I mean, it made Mick Foley's reaction look like kids'  I don't care.  Did they all get pumped up?  Hey! 
[02:12:30]  The guy's coming!  That's the lie.  The tooth fairy guy!  No, no, no.  I don't care.  Listen, you ask.  Yeah, we said to make it short.  Exactly.  Well, you asked follow-up questions.  Sure we did.  I don't care.  I'm not asking to talk about it.  You asked me what happened.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Mick Foley caught the rock bottom, is all I'm saying.  All right, very good.  It sounds like there's a buzz there.  Well, not according to you guys, but there is.  And something's going on with Zuccotti Park. 
[02:13:00]  Supposedly, some judge reversed the mayor's order to clear Zuccotti Park.  Thank you, Kurt Love.  Protesters returning right now.  But then again, they got their shit taken away, so are they going to sue the city for  their possessions?  Well, that was the goal of the city and, of course, Mayor Bloomberg, to get them out  of their comfort zone.  So now, if they are allowed back, I don't think they're going to be allowed back with all  the tents and stuff and the sleeping bags.  No.  They shan't be.  They're going to have to toil in the park in the cold with no protection. 
[02:13:30]  But weren't they going to be allowed anyway?  Yeah, this isn't something that has to be.  Did you occupy Oakland camp cleared?  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  Did you hear that?  Is that story confirmed?  What?  About some judge fucking doing that?  Yeah, it's on the New York Times.  Kurt Love is trustworthy.  Not really.  He's got a link to cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com, and it keeps going on.  He's been known to spout off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kurt Love goes on. 
[02:14:00]  Go off half-cocked.  Half-cocked.  Kurt Love's right cunt on people's Facebooks.  Right.  I wouldn't exactly look at him like he's fucking...  Right.  The points are good points.  But I think he's right about this.  I think Bobo threw up in his vehicle, didn't he?  I don't know.  He was dating Bobo for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  They're dating?  That's right.  Do I know Kurt Love?  Yeah, he was dating Bobo.  Yeah, Bobo was hammered drunk at Eastside Dave's party.  At Eastside Dave's party, of course.  Threw up in the car.  What a shit.  Yeah, he got into Kurt's vehicle and proceeded to just projectile vomit.  Imagine cleaning up Bobo's puke. 
[02:14:30]  I would fucking stab him.  I'd pull up to his house and get Mr. Maloonigans to lick it up.  Be a bunch of buttons and stuff.  Yeah, buttons and pennies, paper clips, crayon wrappers.  He puked all over the inside of the car?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking asshole.  Here's Bobo.  He wants so badly to be part of something that I was just lifting my...  He should be Jonestown.  I was just lifting my glass up and going like,  Hey, Bobo, cheers, right?  And take a sip of my beer. 
[02:15:00]  And he would chug whatever drink he had,  thinking we're having a chug contest.  You dunce.  Just a sip.  Relax.  You're a dummy.  Calm down.  I mean, if you're going to date Bobo,  you have to realize he might puke in your car.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Is it cool?  Yes.  Is it cool if you're like at a party and someone's drinking and you yell,  Chugga-Lug it.  Chugga-Lug it.  Chugga-Lug.  You want to hear the last Sandusky?  Only if it's cum. 
[02:15:30]  Gargle with it.  Yeah, bukkake.  Get bleach and metal breath.  Want to hear the last Sandusky clip from The Rock's new show?  Who wouldn't want to?  When is Chuck going to be in here, by the way?  Soon?  It's Chaz.  Chaz Bono.  And he will be.  Chuck Bono will be in here soon.  Chaz.  Don't think Chaz likes Chuck.  Very excited to speak to her.  Him.  Him.  Sandusky on NBC's Rock Center.  The big interview with Bob Costas.  Sandusky says he's not a pedophile.  Final clip. 
[02:16:00]  Are you a pedophile?  No.  Are you sexually attracted to young boys, to underage boys?  Am I sexually attracted?  Okay.  That is a tell.  That is a tell.  When you answer a question with the question, give yourself time to think.  Holy.  That is a big time tell.  What a douchebag this guy is.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Are you a pedophile?  No.  Are you sexually attracted to young boys, to underage boys?  Am I sexually attracted to underage boys? 
[02:16:30]  Sexually attracted?  You know, I enjoy young people.  Dude, wouldn't that be the quickest no in your life?  What a fucking piece of shit.  Are you sexually attracted to young people?  No.  Yeah, you would just blurt out no.  Yes.  What distinction is there?  I enjoy young people.  Go fuck yourself.  He's not asking you that.  Exactly.  You can add that after you say no.  I enjoy young people.  Sexually attracted?  You know, I enjoy young people.  I love to be around them. 
[02:17:00]  Tell someone.  But no, I'm not sexually attracted to young boys.  It sure sounded like it.  Obviously, you're entitled to a presumption of innocence, and you'll receive a vigorous defense.  On the other hand, there is a tremendous amount of information out there, and fair-minded, common-sense people have concluded that you are guilty of monstrous acts.  And they are particularly unforgiving, and they are particularly unforgiving with the type of crimes that have been alleged here. 
[02:17:30]  And so, millions of Americans who didn't know Jerry Sandusky's name until a week ago now regard you not only as a criminal, but I say this, I think, in a considered way, but as some sort of monster.  How do you respond to that?  I don't know what I can say or what I could say that would make anybody feel any different now.  I would just say that if somehow people could hang on until my attorney has a chance to fight, you know, for my innocence. 
[02:18:00]  Because that's about all I could ask right now.  And, you know, obviously, it's a huge challenge.  I'm Batman.  Yeah.  I'm Batman.  What a terrible, terrible job he did at defending himself.  He sucks. 
[02:18:30]  What a fucking...  Can you imagine, do you think he'd be talking about defense like that?  Like, if somebody asked him a question about defense, do you think he'd be...  I think that we have to...  You have to rush on second down.  No, he would just talk.  Innocent until proven guilty.  Innocent until proven guilty.  That's true.  Did you see TMZ posted this picture yesterday?  How about you turn on our computer?  Turn on our monitor.  How about you do that, Sam?  What the fuck are you doing?  Fucking selfish?  What are they, chopped liver?  Just took the last hour off.  The least you could do is put the fucking...  Take it off. 
[02:19:00]  You weren't in studio.  I was doing other things.  Oh, I see.  They're going to reveal themselves eventually.  Oh, I see.  What is this, Sam?  Well, TMZ posted a picture of this guy yesterday and said it was Jerry Sandusky eating donuts  in an airport.  Oh, my God.  It's not Jerry Sandusky, though.  I bet that guy was getting shit on.  It doesn't really look like him, man.  Just because the hair's gray?  Yeah.  There was a guy on the flight, I think.  Dick Van Dyke.  Who was registered as Gerald Sandusky.  And so they saw this guy and started taking his picture.  Now the AP is saying... 
[02:19:30]  He was sticking his dick in the donut holes.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Making them cry.  Putting the munchkins on his chin.  Pulling it out in his jelly on his dick.  See, that would be the blood.  Or Boston cream.  Oh, that's even better.  While young Bob Kelly yelled, ow.  You know what, dude?  Dude.  Anthony AP saying breaking a court order has been issued that will allow Occupy Wall Street  protesters to return with tents. 
[02:20:00]  What?  What?  Look that up.  That's fine.  Now I think someone's talking about it.  How are they like...  Yeah, stop it.  Now I'm suspicious.  How are they allowed to do that?  Maybe they're saying that...  Again, maybe the court's saying they didn't get due process.  With tents.  They usually don't do things this quickly, either.  Globe and Mail said no longer open for tents 19 minutes ago.  How about Boston.com?  Breaking news.  Lawyers.  Court order will allow Occupy Wall Street protesters to return with tents. 
[02:20:30]  Boffiston.  I got two sources now.  Lawyers order?  That means he's filing something and the judge could say no?  No, it says court order.  Lawyers are saying court order will allow.  Oh.  What do you got on that, Sam?  I haven't seen anything on Boston.com, at least on the front page.  Oh, Sam, you're so full of turkey.  No, I'm not lying.  You are lying.  Don't lie.  You're lying.  You're lying.  I'm not lying. 
[02:21:00]  I'm just trying to find the article, all right?  All right.  Because I didn't...  And I didn't think you would throw me off the show, but I wanted to be on the show.  And you took it...  Oh, God, when he gets into that mode, you just want to punch his face in.  Yeah, and you know how you want to punch his face when you're headlining the stress factory  and you're destroying, and there's a babbling woman up front.  Oh, no.  And you think that she's...  My friend Billy showed up.  He's an ex-cop.  So I'm thinking she's Bill's chick.  And I'm like, I'm getting annoyed.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  Why did Bill bring this loud girl? 
[02:21:30]  But I don't want to call him out in front of the audience because he's a guy I played  Little League with.  Yeah.  And then at the end, they walk out separately, and I see she's with fucking Bobo.  Oh, man.  Once again, he brings a person to the show that fucking yaps through it.  What girl was with Bobo?  It was his mom's friend.  Oh, boy.  And she apologized after.  She wasn't being horrible.  She was just babbling.  And it was like, once again, he brings a fucking babbling person to the show.  So this says, uh, it's just the city's plan to allow protesters back into the park after 
[02:22:00]  it's cleaned.  Under the city's plans, protesters should not be allowed to use tents, sleeping bags.  Right.  But maybe I'm finding, maybe there's another article on it.  No, there isn't.  Mm-hmm.  I defy you.  What is it that you wanted to write?  I need it all day.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Fuck you!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It'll be at the hard rock.  On the draw.  Yes.  Bobo, on Thursday.  You know, we should mention what's going on there. 
[02:22:30]  Fuck yeah.  You want to mention that?  I'm looking forward to Thursday very much.  Yeah.  Thursday at the hard rock, we are doing a thanks for nothing little appearance from, I believe,  8 to 10 for us.  And then the 10 to 11 hour is the shit show on the road.  He took the shit show on the road.  Okay.  And, uh, but, uh, during, uh, the, uh, 8 to 10 segment, we're going to have fun and  hijinks and laugh with, uh, I guess Voss is going to be there.  Yep.  And, uh, Bobby.  Bobby will be there.  Bobby Kelly, um, and some, uh, you know, special guests and whatnot. 
[02:23:00]  And, here's the thing.  Ladies and gentlemen, the first Thanksgiving.  Oh, yeah.  A play.  A play written by the crew.  Mm-hmm.  Performed by the crew with special stars, Jim Norton.  Star studded.  And Anthony Cumia will be in this play.  And I believe Rich Voss as well.  The first Thanksgiving.  And Richie will be.  Yes.  Rich Voss.  We are going to do a little bit of theater for you. 
[02:23:30]  That's right.  That day.  A genuine play showing the first Thanksgiving.  I think it's going to be a lot of fun.  It's going to be wonderful.  See, I want to be in a play, too.  I'm a good actor.  I'd come in here, I'd go, what's everybody doing?  You've got turkey feathers on you.  And there's also, while you're watching the play, you could have a chance to win Cashola.  Cash-ola.  Cash-ola.  Is that, like, real cash?  That's right.  Hey, I know Cashola took me to this place.  We're doing a mash.  Cash-y-ola. 
[02:24:00]  I've got to pee real bad.  Do we have time before, Chaz?  Yeah, we'll take a break.  I'll kiss you on the lips before Chuck comes in.  Let's take a top of the hour break.  We're doing a mashed potato eating contest.  Yes, we are.  What?  At the venue.  That's crazy.  We don't have time to do all this stuff.  It's going to have to be, like, a mashed potato eating bit.  That's right.  What are we doing with that?  They're going to eat mashed potatoes and do what?  Is Pat from Monocular?  No.  It's throughout the entire...  Yeah, they'll be on the side eating mashed potatoes.  You just get to see people eat a ton of mashed potatoes.  That's funny.  That stinks.  You don't want to see...  You don't want to see three people eat ten pounds of mashed potatoes? 
[02:24:30]  I do.  But what else are we going to do?  Get them to dance?  I do.  It'll work.  It'll work.  I want to see them shitting out like a Carvel machine.  Yes.  Somebody better be puking on that stage.  Well, yeah, but you know what?  What?  You puke, you're out.  They get disqualified if they puke.  All right.  One of the guys will not let me down and they will puke.  Or a girl.  You know who I found out is going to be there yesterday?  Who?  Bobo?  Bobby?  Yeah, Pat Duffy.  Oh, nice.  Pat Duffy.  The triumphant return of Pat Duffy. 
[02:25:00]  That's right.  What about...  Does he have anything planned for the show?  No, I think he's coming as a listener.  How about Creep Pie Jones?  Creep Pie Jones won't come because he thinks that you guys have cost him jobs.  Yes.  What about Intern David?  Intern David certainly will be there.  Will not acknowledge that the radio show exists or that he was ever on it.  He's totally wiped that part of his life off.  Even though I've specifically given him glowing job recommendations, he thinks we're holding him back.  He literally runs away when he sees any of us on the street.  I've heard Sam give David job recommendations or whatever they're called. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  When they call up and say, hey, Sam.  References.  References.  References.  Sam was given glowing references and, you know, apparently he still thinks that this is a problem.  Especially when Danny and Travis...  What?  Who's that?  The guy that's gay on TV but not gay in real life.  Eric Stonestreet.  Eric?  Eric.  We had him on last time.  Why aren't we having him on this time?  Because we had him on last time.  Chaz Bono.  For a second, I thought it was Chuck.  I'm going to pee.  I got to take one.  It's Chaz.  I thought it was Chuck for a second.  Go make wee-wees, Jimmy.  His name is Chaz.  Hey, really fast. 
[02:26:00]  Another big story that most people don't give a fuck about, but it's very interesting.  The NBA is in a really fucked up spot right now.  It's over.  I guess there's no basketball, huh?  Well, the NBA, the players rejected the latest offer from the owners and pretty much the last offer, right?  Yeah, they said it was their final offer.  And now the players are disbanding their own union and they're going to bring this to court.  And a lot of players are upset because they wanted to do this months ago.  Oh, they wasted a bunch of time.  But if it goes to court, not only is this season wiped out, I read something this morning that it could be years to settle. 
[02:26:30]  I don't know if that's...  I think that's what David Stern's saying to kind of, you know...  To scare people?  Yeah, to scare people.  I highly doubt, you know, either side would let, you know, years worth of revenue...  What seems to be the problem?  A court case could end basketball.  Huh?  What's the problem?  I liked it.  I know, I know, that was...  Of course you did.  Yes, yes, predator of law.  Right.  No, religion.  Religion.  Religion, right. 
[02:27:00]  What's the big holdup here?  Revenue sharing?  What's always the big holdup in...  They want to give the players less, right?  Yeah, well, you know, all the owners always want more money, and all the players always  want more money.  How about free neck tattoos?  Well, I think a lot of them have that, so I don't think that's a good negotiating tactic.  No, it's probably not.  Good news for the Globetrotters.  Yes.  Fuck yeah, man.  Their town is going to go way up.  I'm scared, because I think crime is going to increase in the major cities.  They have money.  Well, it doesn't matter, does it?  Just because they're unoccupied. 
[02:27:30]  Exactly.  It keeps those people in front of TVs.  Right.  You know...  Their attention isn't shifted elsewhere.  That's right.  It keeps them in front of the TV.  Well, the players, too, I was saying.  Oh, the players?  Yeah, the players.  The players might...  Yeah.  Maybe the guy that's 10 or 11 on the team doesn't get in much.  Idle hands on the devil's playground.  Ah!  That's what they say.  It's horrible.  But this NBA thing is pretty fucked up.  This is how basketball in New Jersey is going to end.  Really? 
[02:28:00]  Well, yeah, the Nets are going to Brooklyn next year.  Oh, yeah, they've got no season.  No.  That's hilarious.  Ah!  And I think the owners would just wait it out until they get to a point where the players  break down, or they get new guys to start a new type of league, right?  Yeah, well, I mean, if they're disbanding the union...  Holy fuck!  And I'm sure these arenas aren't too happy either.  Like, I read an article saying that, you know, Madison Square Garden was scrambling to book  concerts because they've got all of these dates that were blocked off for Knicks. 
[02:28:30]  41 games a year.  Now, that's a good idea.  Who said this?  Something like that.  Oh, Cousin Dupree.  That's good.  What happened?  How about the XBA?  Yeah!  What an idea!  We're ready, Vince.  We're ready.  Give us one more shot.  Smash Mouth Basketball.  Trampolines!  Yeah!  There's got to be trampolines!  And you're going to be having full contact. 
[02:29:00]  No fucking penalties.  Full contact basketball.  Full contact Smash Mouth Basketball.  Jesse Ventura doing play-by-play for basketball.  Oh yeah, you would love that, right?  Hey Vince, landmines?  Let me tell you.  Landmines in the XBA?  We're going to have landmines.  There's going to be holes in the floor like at the Coliseum with tigers in them.  You know, barbed wire nets?  That explode!  Steel cage around the court.  It's the only explanation.  A cage match, right?  Yes! 
[02:29:30]  It's a championship, though.  I like it.  Championship.  I like it a lot.  X-B-A.  Yes!  That's what I'm talking about.  Three letters.  X-B-A.  Get on it, Vince.  A.  Yeah.  We'll just start a new league with players that will accept their demands, man.  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like this is headed.  We should take a break because Chaz is almost here.  Yes.  Chaz.  All right.  So we'll break.  And then Chaz Bono's next.  What is Chaz promoting?  A reality show on OWN called Being Chaz, I think, right? 
[02:30:00]  I think it's a documentary.  It's a documentary.  Oh, I think it's a one-time show.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Boy, that OWN channel sure loves its documentaries on people that are on the channel.  Did you see the one on ELO?  It's online.  I saw the one online where everyone kisses his ass.  It's hilarious.  You know, it was a young boy, and they show a young, tussleable ELO.  So they decided to not show the alcoholic here.  No, no.  They cut that part out conveniently.  Do you guys think you could make a different documentary? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  We could make a hell of a documentary on ELO that looks nothing like the one that was put  out by Oprah's people.  Boy, the young ELO, though, would Sandusky have loved him or what?  Oh, yeah.  We should play that little video on our show.  Maybe tomorrow.  It's hilarious.  It really is funny.  It's just so fucking...  It's revisionist history of ELO.  It's pretty badass, though.  You got Oprah fucking saying how great you are.  I know you're not a big fan of the Oprah, but that's pretty fucking huge.  It's propaganda on the lines of fucking Goebbels. 
[02:31:00]  You think?  Yeah.  It's fucking...  It's all, like, fake.  Just to pump up the new network?  What about the empty fucking minibar in his room and in Eatman's room when we were watching  fucking Letterman?  And then giving Eatman the big bill.  And then giving Eatman the bill.  And falling asleep on the couch.  Which I fully enjoyed.  Passing out on the couch, actually.  Fully enjoyed that one.  They're arguing over whether or not they can reopen the park.  Zuccotti Park.  Tense?  Yeah, they're saying...  Tense.  The group filed a temporary restraining order against the city from blocking the protesters. 
[02:31:30]  This would allow the protesters to return with their belongings.  This is stupid.  They're going back and forth.  They're not...  But what is the owner saying?  It's his fucking park.  I don't see that.  I think it comes down to him.  Riot police have their headgear on again in Zuccotti Park and are telling people on the  sidewalk to move on.  The atmosphere is less relaxed than a few minutes ago.  Where's the O.B. and Anthony helicopter?  I want to take a little ride down there.  It's on the roof.  What do you think?  All right.  Let's go on the roof.  It's where it is every day.  Let's go to the O.A. helicopter and go down there.  Right next to the Howie-copter. 
[02:32:00]  He doesn't know why everyone is talking about his America's Got Talent thing.  Oh, America's Got Talent.  I'm going to be a judge.  That's what I do.  No?  You don't think he's going to be a judge?  No, of course not.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't think anyone is believing that he's actually going to be a judge.  You think it's just the hype?  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant PR.  It's brilliant PR, man.  Absolutely brilliant PR.  It really ain't happening. 
[02:32:30]  It ain't happening.  That's what Mars will never hear of him.  We should break and come back?  Sure.  Why don't we?  Sure.  Chuck Bono next.  Stay there.  This is the O.B. Anthony Channel.  I would be able to control the boner if this was more like expected to happen, but I didn't  expect you'd be here in studio.  What an adorable little boner.  This is a lovely surprise that I am very thankful for. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, I love surprises.  This is a lovely gift.  It feels like Christmas already.  Oh, you're Christmas all over my shorts.  I'm just trying to look at her.  At the same time, I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, Bobo.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, it's so cute.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, pretend I'm your brother.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  I'm trying to control the boner here. 
[02:33:30]  Your tweets excite me 
[02:34:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  We got Chaz Bono coming in 
[02:34:30]  Soon, right?  Yes  Yeah  Promoting Being Chaz  Sunday, November 27th  At 9pm on OWN  And running late  Which is fine  I mean, interviews run late  But this is why  I don't like to hear crap from people  If we run a few minutes over  Because I don't see anybody  Walking into Howard's studio  And they shouldn't  But people should never be comfortable enough  To come in here  Like, we really complained about that  And I sound like a dick  This is why 
[02:35:00]  Because we have to deal with it, too  Exactly  Shit rolls downhill, as they say  Exactly  Judge Wapner's still alive  I thought he died in 1980  Holy fuck  Is that a typo?  He's 50  He's 50 years old?  What?  Judge Joseph  He's 92  Wapner  Wasn't Harvey Levin a part of that?  He was the legal consultant  I believe for the People's Court  Harvey Levin used to be out on the street  Doing interviews  He still is?  No, no  Those are shows he taped years ago, right? 
[02:35:30]  No, he's still doing it  For the new ones?  I'm not even joking  Yeah, I watch it  For the new People's Court  He's still doing it  Oh, yeah  What's Doug Levin doing?  I don't know  I hope he's been killed  That Asner 82  I love that Asner  Can we play the famous Destroyer thing?  Judge Wapner looks fine  Yes, we can  How long is it?  A minute and a half  A minute and a half  I mean 90 seconds, you rock  Less radio to do today  You want to hear that for Asner's 82  Sure  Oh, my God  Joe Rogan was

Documentary  Because there was another one  Where it was leading up to the surgery  What, the breast surgery?  Yeah, that was called  Becoming Chaz  Becoming Chaz  And now this is being Chuck  I saw a  What?  Chaz  Yeah, Chaz  I saw something on MTV  With this chick  That wanted to become a guy  Or this guy  That wanted to become a chick  And then this chick  That wanted to become a guy  And they had surgery  And they showed the breast 
[02:39:00]  Like they took the  It was this black chick  That looked like a guy  And cut her tits off  And it was disgusting  They cut the tits off  And then they  They were like laying the nipples  Like the  The round part of the nipple  Laying in there  And then sewing that on  And then the little  Nipple tip  They popped that in  Like a little nugget  Oh my gosh  It was terrible  And then the chick  Or the guy that wanted  To be a chick  Was like even more  Fucked up  That was like  Getting the whole 
[02:39:30]  Fucking penis  Cut up  And turned inside out  And getting tits  And that was just weird  Weirdness  I don't get it  And they were blurring out  The tits on the  Guy that wanted to  Become the girl  Before it got  The breast implants  They were blurring them out  So it was just  The guy's chest  But like  Hormones I guess  Gave it a little  But he looked enough  Like a girl  Where it would have been  Like tits on TV  And then  But they showed 
[02:40:00]  The girls  The black girl  That wanted to become  The guy  They showed her  Post-op tits  All cut off  As a pseudo man's chest  But that's showing tits  Exactly  Wow that is so  Fucking confusing  I just thought it was weird  Yeah  I agree  Is it  Is there anything  More humiliating  Than when they  I'm changing my  Oh it's down  When they cube out  A guy's  Man boobs on TV  Yeah yeah  I know  Anything more humiliating  Well they do it  From time to time  Because they're like  Oh boy 
[02:40:30]  Your chest looks  Way too much  Like a girl  It's I'm changing  My sex  Or something like that  Yeah  If you want to see it  Of course we want to see it  Yeah but  Oh Sam was right there  And then he passed it  And I don't know  Where he was  You saw it  Yeah I saw it  It passed by  It's like a slot machine  Though  How did you see it  Everything's moving by  Too fast  Oh god  What are you doing  I see the same things  Moving by  But now I'm scrolling up  Because you said  I passed it  I don't know  If it's going up  Or down

[02:41:30]  Taken out  How about the penis  And the penis was cut off  Or turned inside out  Oh it's so sore  Oh is this a commercial  Last year  Why do guys have Adam's apples  And girls don't  Girls do  But it's much smaller  I think it's to give us  That deeper voice  And what's that for  More timber to our voice  Why do we have to have  Deeper voices  I think it's something  To do with like  The whole animal thing  It's part of being a male  It's a testosterone  Induced thing 
[02:42:00]  The Adam's apple  Is from testosterone  And it's to make  You know  Just made that up  Makes your voice  Deeper and more  You know  If you get a testosterone  What if it fails the test  Oh that's bad  Thanks  Oh my god  That's so amazing  Look at that  What's wrong with the clip Sam  Are you  I don't know  What could possibly  You keep hitting the button  Oh  Maybe that's it  That guy's becoming a woman  Wait go back  Yeah that  Whose sex organs differ  From how they perceive  Their own gender  These are questions  That can cause  Anguish  Is that a woman 
[02:42:30]  Becoming a man  In the black  I don't know  Yeah  That's a woman  Yeah  That's a woman  Yeah  Get the fuck  In this episode of True Life  You'll meet two young people  Taking extreme measures  To bring their bodies  Hold on  Pause  Into alignment  Wow  Once  What was that  That lump  That they just threw  On the tray  It was  It was inside  Of a tit  Of a  Yeah  Of an implant  Or is that  No no no  It's that  That black  Holy shit  The black chick  Are you serious  They used to be a guy  So cut her tits off  And they just  Took a bunch  Of tit meat  Right on the tray 
[02:43:00]  Tit meat  Nothing but tit meat  Why didn't they give  The other person  The tit meat  I know right  Why not  Now they gave her silicone  Or am I heard it  Wrong  For the first time  Ever in my life  I want to live  That's a guy  Yeah  L was born with male genitalia  But has always felt  That she's really female  She tried living  As a heterosexual man  But the years of repressing her desire to be a woman almost destroyed her.  I don't know anyone else.  She almost pulls it off.  Almost.  Now Elle's embarking on a complete gender transformation. 
[02:43:30]  When you go like this, smooth.  But then go against the grain.  Will sexual reassignment surgery finally make her feel like the person she longs to be?  For years, Ted has been living as a man and hiding that he's a biological female.  Can you pause that, please, Gregory, really quickly?  I can't hide the fact I have a vagina anymore.  I'm a woman.  I don't want to be a woman.  I want to be Theodore. 
[02:44:00]  My real name is Tedalina.  Tedalina?  Yes, Tedalina from Schenectomy.  Ugly name.  It certainly is, Samuel.  I want my breasts taken off.  I'm tired of this ugly, gaping wound between my legs.  I don't want children.  I want to have a big penis to wave at people, like my friend, Mr. Sandusky.  Ted's genital emporium.  And you saw the show.  That's a woman? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, that's a chick.  Is that, how far into the process is that a woman?  That is total woman that has just been taking male hormones for the facial hair and whatnot that it's got.  But she has huge tits that she has to bind down when she puts on clothes.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  That's a woman trying to be a guy.  Right.  What?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  I think that's a much easier transformation to make woman to guy.  Yeah.  Because, except for the genitals.  Except for the genitalia. 
[02:45:00]  Yes, because the woman, they're able to, you know, fashion a vagina out of a penis.  Why don't they have a shot of her when she was a total woman?  They do.  Did we see it already?  No, they get to that.  Oh, okay.  He scared me.  They get to that.  ...prevent him from feeling as masculine as he wants.  Where's the tranny locker room?  Ted's hoping to get surgery to reconstruct his chest, but doesn't have enough money to pay for it.  Will he summon up the courage to ask his family for help?  You're not going to die if you don't get this surgery.  Even though they're not fully supportive. 
[02:45:30]  I don't want...  That's not it.  They're willing to change their bodies drastically and reflect their...  That sucks.  You've got to be kind of like that.  That sucks.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  They had a daughter and want to keep a daughter.  Yeah, it's got to be weird for parents.  But the daughter never thought she was a daughter.  I get that part of it, I guess.  Yeah, but, you know, raising it as a little kid, you're raising it as a daughter, and then all of a sudden, whoopsie.  I'm sure it's confusing for them.  The Chaz.  But they're not getting their tits cut off. 
[02:46:00]  We'll have to ask the Chaz Bono if we ever get Chaz Bono.  I think Chaz is coming in only a half hour late, and this is not a knock on Chaz at all.  It's just amazing.  Right now?  Mr. Stern just went to break.  It's amazing how we get shit from people.  Mr. Stern.  What?  You're a brown noser.  You've got to be a little respectful of people.  I don't know the guy.  I don't know the guy.  Okay?  So, Chaz should be in here any minute.  Yeah, we could ask Chaz some of these questions about, you know, parents and how they feel 
[02:46:30]  about it.  Titties.  Titties.  Things like that.  I'm going to ask a whole bunch of good motherfucking questions.  Is you?  Is you is?  So where are you from?  Is you is or is you ain't?  Is that Chaz?  No.  It's every guy.  Every guy that comes walking down the hall now.  It's the out cue guys.  Is that Chaz?  Is that your name?  You sure the one on the left isn't Chaz?  Chaz.  All right, Dick.  Who's your favorite team?  I'm going to ask a whole bunch of questions.  Who's your favorite team?  That's a good question. 
[02:47:00]  I'm going to ask a whole bunch of motherfuckers.  Let's just ask her about football.  How tall are you motherfuckers?  Let's ask her if she saw the big game last night.  The big game.  Packers 9-0, by the way.  Just to get all that info out.  Destroy the Vikings 45-7.  Well, the men, Vic, are probably not doing what they thought.  It's not catching on.  Is that Chaz?  No.  Who's that, Sam?  Is that Chaz?  No, that's one of the engineers.  Oh, fuck it.  There's Chaz.  By the way, Kat Von D claims Jesse James cheated on her with 19 women. 
[02:47:30]  Whoa.  Remember when Jesse James was in here and was talking to Jacker?  I was talking about, you know, this was the love of his life.  Yeah, yeah.  In love and everything was different.  See, because he would have cheated with 30 women.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  That's how much he loves her.  He's the Sandra Bullock guy.  He was in love.  He was in love.  He told us how much he was in love.  This was different.  He needs to get that dick wet, I guess.  He loves fucking.  Actually, I think you guys are behind because I think she tweeted that it's up to 20.  Or she's Facebooking it's up to 20. 
[02:48:00]  Yesterday, she Facebooked 19, so maybe she Facebooked again.  Why does she care?  Kat Von D?  Because she had her heart broken.  She seems to be the problem, Sam.  You think so?  She's had a lot of guys since I've been watching that tattoo show.  Yeah, so lighten up, Francis.  And it's not like she wants to date a lot.  It seems like she's trying to find the love, but she's...  What happened to Nikki Sixx?  Well, you know what?  What happened to the guy before Nikki Sixx?  She always goes after the bad boy, and I tell her, it's not good for you.  You understand. 
[02:48:30]  I am the bad boy, though.  That's how I understand.  I understand that side of it.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah?  Yeah.  Remember that guy?  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah?  Is he still hanging with Zsa Zsa?  Yeah.  He's the bad boy guy.  Yeah, what's...  Zsa Zsa's gonna be dead.  He has a little more room on the bed.  How is Zsa Zsa still alive?  I don't know.  Every other week, she's rushed to the hospital bleeding.  Cutting a piece off of her.  Didn't she lose her leg?  Yeah.  That's why my joke should have worked.  Why I said he's got a little more room on the bed.  I didn't expect it.  I can't believe I got a total zero on that. 
[02:49:00]  No, we're just all looking out the hall for Chuck.  Chaz.  Chaz, I mean...  Said on her Wikipedia that she changed her last name from son to Salvatore.  That's middle name.  What'd I say?  The last name.  I meant middle name.  Thank God I read that already.  Surprised it's not on the prep sheet.  What?  Chaz is the...  It was Chaz to be son, Bono.  Those hippies named to that.  And she says on her Wikipedia she's now Chaz Salvatore.  Where's the one sheet of Chaz?  Oh, my mother makes a Chaz Salvatore. 
[02:49:30]  You got it.  They melts in your mouth.  Thanks.  The Zuccotti situation is still developing.  Zuccotti, what's up?  Protesters definitely allowed back.  Now we're just wondering if it's...  Well, they said they'd be allowed back.  Now we're wondering if they're going to be allowed tents.  No.  That's key to this whole thing.  If they're not allowed tents, they're in deep trouble.  I'm trying to piss again, dude.  I'm trying to piss myself out.  I literally have to go...  I can't stop pissing.  What happened?  Do you have a yeast infection?  No.  Is it a yeast infection?  Too much coffee.  I got to run.  They are not going to let them bring those tents back.  No fucking way.  Want to have a friendly bet?  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  I agree with you.  $8 million.  This is the most friendly bet of all time.  Just I agree.  We both win.  That is a friendly bet.  I mean, that could be a bet, too.  That you both agree.  Yeah.  We're in bet mode, but then we both decided to take the same answer.  All right.  I'm going to bet, though, that your agreeing is wrong.  Oh, I think they're going to allow tents.  It's some bizarre fucking civil rights type of thing.  A court order of telling the city...  I'm going tents, man.  Fuck it.  Nah.  Tents. 
[02:50:30]  I'm saying no tents.  Didn't they throw all their shit in the garbage?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, like, what are we getting court orders for?  These bums have a way of getting new shit.  We already threw all your shit out.  We threw your shit out.  All right.  You can have a bag.  It's in the garbage.  Yeah.  Go ahead, garbage picker.  Exactly.  Hey, is Gary here today?  No.  Really?  Why are you laughing?  Because you knew that and you asked me anyway.  That's not fucking swaying.  Is he working from home?  Yeah, Travis told you off the air that that was what was happening and you asked me on  the air.  What?  He's working from home?  I want to work from home. 
[02:51:00]  How do you do that?  I want it too.  We want to work from home, Sam.  I mean, I would assume that that would...  What does that entail, by the way?  I got microphones and a fucking...  If we could set up...  Type in an ISDN.  What does that entail?  Learning what's on the channel you're supposed to be supervising?  You do have more time to listen.  What?  You do have more time to listen, I would think, when you're working from home.  Commute time has cut down drastically.  Yeah.  And you know what I would do?  I would do it from the basement, right?  And then if they wanted to have a video meeting with me, I'd just have a cardboard cutout 
[02:51:30]  of me made up and program in just a second of static.  And then I'd put it in front, even though digital doesn't static.  But I would do that.  And then I'd put that in front and then just go back to bed.  Right.  And they would be talking.  Anthony, that's a good idea.  You can have a little keyboard.  Oh, look, Anthony's at least staying awake.  With your sound effects.  Oh, I'll just have sound effects.  And me talking.  Yeah.  Like, I'll have the microphone right in front of my mouth so you can't see that I'm not  moving my mouth.  Right.  And I'll just be staring and going, yeah. 
[02:52:00]  That's a terrific idea.  I'll buy that baby.  Whose baby is that?  You could have your arms connected to strings and somebody, while you're napping, just pulling  the strings.  So your arms are moving.  Pull the strings!  I asked Kenny to close the curtains.  Just so I don't want anybody looking in and signaling us.  Oh.  Because nobody signals anybody.  And they shouldn't.  So you love the show.  Is she on the way?  Yeah.  I just saw him walking in the men's room.  He.  What?  Yeah.  It's gotten to that point?  He's legally a man.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, boy.  Legally considered a man.  Not if you have to sit down to pee.  Mars doesn't sit down to pee. 
[02:52:30]  He would like that.  No.  Oh, that's right.  Remember, Mars shits.  Mars?  And then after he's done shitting, he stands up and walks to the urinal.  No, he doesn't.  Yeah, he does.  I swear to God, he does.  Because he says he won't piss like a bitch.  Right.  Mars and Chaz.  You mean Chaz stands up in the urinal?  No, I just saw...  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know what Chaz was doing.  Maybe dropping a deuce.  What does it look like?  Chaz just looks like Chaz.  He.  It's a pro.  No, but I mean, does she look manly?  Yeah.  It's a bro.  Beard?  I didn't really look so I was at the urinal, but... 
[02:53:00]  Joe.  Oh, we lost Joe.  Joe's kid.  There must be a little envy at the urinal, right?  Like seeing guys standing up peeing and having to hit the stall, though.  Yeah, but if you want to be a guy, that's got to be a little awkward.  To watch guys and be like, ah, that must be so cool to stand at the urinal.  Wouldn't you just stand there anyway and just hope you could aim properly?  Aiming a vagina is very difficult.  It's like aiming a rocket without fins.  Jess always tells me she's envious that she can't write her name in the snow in urine. 
[02:53:30]  She can if she could do like that Russian dance.  That's true.  While she's peeing.  She just fell out your name.  Are you taking a request today?  Could be.  Could you do your sound effect of a girl peeing?  Oh, yeah.  I love how girls sound when they pee.  Because guys, it's more of that elevated stream thing.  Girls have this weird aeration thing that echoes in the toilet when they're sitting down.  And it sounds like...  What is that? 
[02:54:00]  It's weird.  Guys, it's just like you're holding a stream, like pouring it out of a pitcher or something in the bowl.  Sure.  It's that bubbly kind of sound.  Girls, though.  And then they wipe their little pussies.  They wipe their pussies.  Oh, hi.  I'm kidding.  I hope that... 
[02:54:30]  Give me fair warning there for Sam.  Sam?  What's up, Sam?  Why are you smiling?  Oh, fuck.  What's the problem now?  Because Kenny's out there going, she must be dropping a dude.  And then Spencer goes, he's coming.  And Kenny goes, she.  Oh, God.  I go, Kenny, what are you doing?  See, I'm just making dumb jokes.  Kenny really believes that.  We're going to get...  Yeah, let's go.  Ladies and gentlemen, Chaz Bono entering the studio. 
[02:55:00]  Wow, she looks great.  Hey.  We're on.  We'd like doing it this way.  Right.  Yeah.  Hey, Chaz.  I'm good.  How are you?  Welcome to the show.  Thank you.  Pleasure to meet you.  Thank you.  Sorry, the chair.  We had a chair break yesterday, so that's a new replacement.  Okay.  Yeah, that guy was sitting in it.  Oh, teasing, of course.  Thanks.  So, Chaz, you got a show on OWN?  Yes, I did.  Is it a documentary?  Yeah, it's kind of like a follow-up special to my original documentary.  All right.  So, yeah, it takes up where about? 
[02:55:30]  Right before Dancing with the Stars.  Oh, cool.  I thought it was a reality show.  Because OWN won't release the whole show.  They have clips of it.  That you can download.  So I watched probably 10 minutes total, like a minute from each part of the show.  It was great.  I thought it was an actual, like a running series.  No, no, no.  No, it's not.  Your girlfriend is, it's funny, you address a lot of stuff in these little clips, the fact  that, you know, she's a drinker or an ex-drinker.  Has that, like, been a big problem in the relationship?  It's been a challenge, yeah.  It's been, you know, when we met, we were both sober. 
[02:56:00]  And I have stayed that way.  And she's gone back and forth, which is, you know, it's just tough.  It's got to be tough, yeah.  Did you used to drink and stopped?  I wasn't ever much of a drinker.  I was a drug addict.  Oh, okay.  I did.  What was your poison?  Prescription opiates.  But at the end, it ended up being Oxycontin.  I never did Oxycontin.  I quit long before Oxycontin was around.  It sounds like it was a fun drug.  It sounds like a good one.  It's not like a party drug, you know.  It was more of like, you know, be depressed in your house and smoke a lot drug. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  How does it make you feel compared to, like, alcohol or drugs?  Or, like, pot, let's say.  Well, it's not at all like pot.  I mean, I was never much of a pot smoker.  I did a little in high school.  It kind of made me paranoid.  No, I mean, it's more like Vicodin or Percetin.  You know, it's a painkiller.  Doesn't Vicodin make you not be able to shit?  Like, I never did Vicodin either.  It does, right?  It backs you up a little bit.  It sure does.  All of them do.  Wow.  Yeah.  That doesn't sound fun now. 
[02:57:00]  So you're sitting around depressed in your house and you're constipated.  Exactly.  That sounds horrible.  It wasn't fun.  It's not fun, you know.  It's a life is too painful to deal with kind of drug.  It's not like a let's go, you know, get crazy.  Now, growing up with parents that were obviously kind of the hippie mentality from the 60s and  stuff, did that help with getting you into drugs?  No, not at all.  Really?  No, no.  I mean, you know, both of my parents, there was no drugs or alcohol really in the house. 
[02:57:30]  I mean, both of them, especially with alcohol, are just total lightweight.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, and my mom, like, you know, she's, she's so sensitive to everything.  She can't, she doesn't take anything.  So, no, no.  I had, I had a chronic pain issue.  And so that, and then I lost, when I was in my early 20s, I lost my, my, my girlfriend  to cancer.  And I think those two things, plus it's, it runs all through both sides of my family. 
[02:58:00]  Wow.  Really?  We're like, just kind of the perfect storm.  Oof.  You're very, you, like, people talk about passable and not passable.  Like, you, it's, if I didn't know, I would never know that you had made a transformation.  I mean, visually, you just, and listening, it's like you just.  I'm sitting here just amazed.  Yeah.  I'm so confused by this whole thing.  I'm not, I'm not, I really am, though.  I mean, I want to learn about it, I guess, because I'm, I'm blown away.  Your girlfriend, because, is your girlfriend, like, is, is in a lesbian relationship, you 
[02:58:30]  know, and then all of a sudden you make this big transformation.  How does that get sold?  Um, my girlfriend is, is bisexual.  So she had been with men and women.  Oh, okay.  So, um, so yeah, I mean, it was, it worked out pretty good.  I mean, it's still, it's still, you know, there's a, there's a huge difference between,  even though before I wasn't, I, you know, feminine in any way, there's still a difference  between having estrogen in your system and then testosterone.  And so, you know, I'm definitely in certain ways, probably more challenging now. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  You know, is your temper worse?  Um, I don't have much of a temper now, but I, but I had no temper before.  So I guess in that sense it is.  Welcome to manhood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a bitch.  That's a, now, when, when did you decide that you were going to, because it's pretty  extreme decision to make.  Yeah.  Uh, when, when did you decide that you'd had it being a girl? 
[02:59:30]  It took me about eight or nine years, you know, of really, I mean, I knew it was the  right thing for me to do.  What years were they?  Uh, like, oh, awesome.  Thank you.  Um, I've probably started to figure it out 30, 31.  And I transitioned at 40.  So, um, uh, it, I, I, I knew it was the right thing for me to do.  I was terrified of, of just rejection on every level and of, you know, knowing that there would 
[03:00:00]  be no way I could do it privately.  And so the idea of having to transition in front of the world was just, you know, so scary.  So now how do you, how do you think about how it went in hindsight now?  Um, I think it went, you know, it went as, as good as I could have hoped.  I think so.  Yeah.  But I got, you know, I really got to a place, uh, and again, it took a long time where I  was comfortable enough with it that, uh, I, I knew that it would be okay. 
[03:00:30]  I mean, I really did.  I kind of got to a place where I was like, all right, this is, this is what it's supposed  to be.  And, and no matter what, I'm going to be okay.  And, you know, I knew that if it was, if it was bad, it would blow over, you know, until  the, you know, there's always your story until the next big story comes along.  It's got to be odd because, uh, well, it's got to be rough for anybody, but you being in  the public eye in your childhood and then, uh, growing up, uh, that's kind of a double  edged sword too. 
[03:01:00]  Cause cause now it's not just your friends and family that you're, I don't know, looking  for acceptance from, but it's the world now looking in and going, what the heck's going  on there?  Right.  That's what I, yeah.  Did I just say what the heck?  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's family friendly radio.  And what an asshole I am.  Oh, shucks, Chez.  Um, yeah, no, it, I mean, that's what it was.  I mean, it was like, it's hard enough to do this and, and for people on new risk, you  do.  I mean, I was so lucky.  I didn't lose anybody for my life, but a lot of trans people transition and lose everybody. 
[03:01:30]  So.  Does your mom have a heart?  Cause I, I know I've heard that your mom, when you came out, had a hard time with it.  Um, did, had she adjusted to that by the time you said, look, I'm going to do this or was  it really hard?  She was totally comfortable with that.  Then this, this, this, you know, was a little tough.  What was her reaction when you, when you told her?  You know, when I first told her, actually, I told her about, um, six or seven months before  I started and she was really cool about it. 
[03:02:00]  And it wasn't the first time we talked about it, you know, she knew that it was something  that I was struggling with and thinking about.  And, um, you know, at one point I was going to do it earlier and then I kind of chickened  out again.  And, uh, so she was really supportive.  And then I think once it actually started happening, um, she just experienced feelings  that she probably, you know, didn't know what happened until it started.  And I think it was, it was hard. 
[03:02:30]  Which were what?  Cause I'm, I don't know anyone.  I think it's like a kind of almost for parents, a grieving process.  I mean, it's a weird thing because, you know, it's a part of you is gone.  I, you know, whatever small female part of me that there was is doesn't exist anymore.  That girl, that girl that she knew and isn't around anymore.  And, you know, and that girl in her mind was a lot bigger than it was in reality.  You know, uh, I mean, I think, you know, that, you know, there were probably expectations  that she had about her little girl before I was even born. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  So, um, and this probably wasn't it.  And this wasn't it.  So, uh, so I think, you know, that, that was kind of what happened.  And I know she was, you know, scared at first, like we didn't, you know, she, she couldn't  handle it, you know, for a while.  And she, she was like, I just, I need some, some time.  Wow.  Yeah.  And so I was like, fine.  And gave that to her.  And, um, when we, you know, I know that when we finally saw each other, she was, you know, 
[03:03:30]  she was nervous that she wouldn't recognize me or it would be different.  And so it is, it's a strange thing because I'm the same, but not, not really.  I mean, you're still the same person, uh, you know, to, to, to talk to and, and, you  know, you could discuss things that had happened.  It's not like your, your mind stopped, uh, when you, when you did that.  Uh, now this has obviously has to be hypothetical, but how do you think your dad would have reacted  to, uh, to this?  Um, you know, I really don't know a hundred percent. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, I, I think that I, you know, I don't know.  I mean, I think that we, we, it eventually would have been okay.  I don't know what he would have initially thought.  It's interesting.  I mean, growing up.  Could have helped you grow a mustache.  Yeah.  Which I, which I still can't grow.  He had a good one.  Oh, he had a phenomenal mustache.  Yeah.  Um, when I was a kid, you know, he was so cool with me.  And, and so, you know, my mom had a really hard time with, with how masculine I was and  he was, you know, great about it. 
[03:04:30]  Now even as a very young kid?  Yeah, as a very young kid.  Cause you looked very girly when they used to bring out on the, the nitty gritty hour.  Yeah.  At the end.  So I'm talking probably about five or six on.  Wow.  Is, is when, you know, I was first really have memory and, and knew that I was, you know,  really different.  And, um, and he totally accepted me.  And for my mom, it was, it was, you know, it was always a battle between us of, you know,  what am I going to wear?  And, and, you know, why don't I have more friends that are girls and all those kinds of things. 
[03:05:00]  Do you think because she's Cher and because she has this, she's this amazing, you know,  a diva.  Cher is that mother?  What's that?  Oh.  His.  Sorry.  Cher, you know, Cher is Cher.  And do you think there was a part of her that looked and said, wow, I want my daughter  to have an image like this because it's a reflection of, do you think there was any, an embarrassment  or an odd feeling?  No, I don't think it was because of who she is.  I think it's just as, as, as a, as a mother.  And, and especially, you know, we didn't know about any of this stuff in the seventies  when I was growing up, you know, I didn't, I didn't know that, that people could even 
[03:05:30]  transition.  And I never heard about being transgender and, um, and, you know, so it wasn't dealt with  them.  And if I was, if I was that age now, there's, there's so many more resources and, you know,  you'd hope that a parent would, um, you know, would, you would seek out some, you know,  help and guidance, but at that time, no.  And you still, it's, it's interesting to me because when they go, when you go from male  to female, they, they, they, the sexual reassignment, they change your penis into a vagina. 
[03:06:00]  You didn't get, it's harder, it seems to make a vagina into a penis.  It is, it's harder.  And so you just decided not to go with that at all.  Um, no, I haven't done it yet.  It's something that I'll, that I'll probably do.  It's, I mean, it's something that I had to research a lot because there's a lot of different  ways of doing it.  And so, and there's, um, you know, pros and cons to each of them.  And so you really kind of need to know, you know, what are, what are the priorities for  you?  So you're not holding out to have children or you don't want to be too?  Oh, I don't have, I've had, I have a full hysterectomy. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, okay.  So absolutely.  No, I, I do not, I am not ever having children.  Wow.  You really are like most men.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I don't.  I mean, that's definitely not my experience.  I mean, I know that, you know, there's been transgender guys who have done that, but.  Yeah.  Uh, to me, that's, that's not an experience I'd want to have.  Does your, no, me neither.  Has your, has your thinking changed?  Um.  Since going through this process?  A little bit.  I mean, it's subtle, but you know, I think it's, it's probably more the way that I express 
[03:07:00]  myself than my actual thought process, you know?  But, um.  But I.  Do you now like football or any of that?  You know what I mean?  I liked football before.  You always did.  So, yeah, I always liked football, um, and I, you know, I always, I was always attracted  to, you know, male things.  I mean, from being a little kid and, you know, only having boys, toys all the way to now, you  know, being an adult.  So, you know, my tastes didn't really change, you know, for the most part. 
[03:07:30]  No, no.  Yeah, um, so, but I think, like, the way that I express myself might have changed a little  bit, um, and, and definitely the way I feel things.  And that doesn't confuse your girlfriend?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's, it's, you know, it is, it's hard, it's hard on a partner.  She must really love you.  Uh, yeah, I mean, but on the other hand, you know, there's been so many improvements 
[03:08:00]  in me because, I mean, I was really, you know, life was really challenging before and  I really wasn't fully present and, uh, you know, there was kind of a, a sadness in me  all the time.  And so, I think I'm probably, you know, a lot more fun to be around now because I just,  I'm, I feel so much better.  It's about feeling comfortable too and that's what I was going to ask you.  What, what part, because you, you have, you still have a vagina, you did have your breasts  taken off and you got the, uh, the testosterone.  Testosterone, what part of that process did you finally go like, wow, this is my body. 
[03:08:30]  This is the body I want.  Like, what part did you start to cross that comfortable line?  Probably the, the top surgery completed.  I mean, the test, starting testosterone was great.  And, um, and then when I had the top surgery, you know, it, it, it's, uh, you know, yeah,  it just all fit into place and my body, you know, the testosterone really makes it start  to change.  And, um, so when I was looking in the mirror, I just, you know, I saw something reflected 
[03:09:00]  that I related to for the first time.  Wow.  Were you afraid that you would like have the cross that point of no return and then go,  oh my God, this isn't what I wanted.  No.  You had no fear of that.  I really didn't.  I mean, I, I, you know, it, it took so long to, to get here.  I knew it was, you know, I knew it was the issue.  What, what I think surprised me more than anything was how many issues it fixed and, and how, um, 
[03:09:30]  how much easier.  I mean, life became easier than I ever thought life could be.  And I became, you know, comfortable in a way that I didn't know was possible until I had  something else to compare it with.  See, it's, it's, and it's different than being just gay, like being a lesbian or being  a homosexual.  It's like, there is a difference between feeling like you're in the wrong.  Yeah.  Well, there's a, obviously, uh, it's biological.  I mean, uh, I mean, you know, gender, gender identity is, is that is how you feel.  And I think because there are so few transgender people in the world, um, people just assume 
[03:10:00]  that if they're, you know, a physical sex and they feel like that sex, you know,  everybody does, but there's really two components to gender.  There's your, your sex and your gender identity, which is how you feel internally.  And for most people, it's the same, but for transgender people, it isn't.  And so it's just trying to match up, you know, your, your physical body with how you feel.  How have you felt like, uh, cause I, I really, I despise when religious people pipe up about 
[03:10:30]  stuff like this and have you found more comfort from them than you thought, or have they just  been as kind of atrocious as we'd expect?  Um, you know, I've gotten, um, I do, you know, I do have gotten, you know, some tweets  from people like, you know, how dare you change, you know, how, how God made you, whatever.  Um, but it doesn't bother me that much.  I mean, you know, I have a, uh, uh, just a different view on it and I, I actually feel 
[03:11:00]  that, um, you know, but the, the, the way how the parents that I was born into being put  on television when I was a little kid, um, and then having the opportunity to, to do this  publicly.  I mean, I think I, I came, was here kind of for a mission to open people's eyes up about  this, you know, and so I really don't, I don't feel like God made any mistake.  Um, I thought, you know, I think I came down with, with, uh, a way to, to, to open people's 
[03:11:30]  minds about something.  It has brought it to the, uh, forefront.  Uh, you must be getting some kudos from, uh, from other people.  Um, you know, I think it, it has helped other people a lot because now, you know, there's  a, there's a reference point.  And so I've heard, you know, from a lot of trans people, um, that they, you know, they've  reconnected with families because of me.  Um, they're being treated better at work.  Um, I've had parents tell me that their kid is being treated better at school because it's 
[03:12:00]  just, you know, I, I feel like people are starting to gain just a little bit more understanding  of this issue that for the most part really freaks people out and scares people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause at first it was kind of like, what, wait, Chastity Bono is doing what?  Right.  And then it just became something like, you know, we see, you see on TV and, uh, you know,  the people, obviously the gossip crap and stuff, but it just became something like, oh yeah.  Right.  How did you get, it's not a big deal.  How did you get outed too? 
[03:12:30]  Cause like you said, the gossip crap.  You were outed, I think by the tabloids.  Uh, I was outed originally.  Yeah.  Like in 1990 by the star.  How did they find out?  Was it something they saw or heard?  Uh, I, I think just, I mean, I was, I was, uh, you know, probably had gone to some lesbian  bars or, you know, just, and I had a girlfriend at the time and, you know, so probably just  people, you know, you, you know, and people, somebody, somebody called, somebody dropped 
[03:13:00]  a dime and yeah.  Wow.  Um, yeah.  What is the issue with the prenup too?  Cause in this, uh, in, in the show, which by the way, I wish I had seen more of it.  It's on, it's really fascinating.  It's called being Chaz.  It's the followup from, from becoming Chaz.  And it's this Sunday.  Oh no, I'm sorry.  Sunday the 27th at nine o'clock it's on own.  So just find it on on your local provider.  And it's at Chaz Bono is the, the, uh, the Twitter name.  Um, and, uh, there's an issue with it. 
[03:13:30]  You're arguing with your girlfriend.  We were arguing about, um, the, the issue was, and it's kind of, you know, was probably  a little bit stupid on my point, but, you know, we talked about at the beginning, this  idea of, of, uh, you know, one of the sticking points in our relationship has been, um, that  she's, you know, relapsed several times and, uh, I kind of hit a wall with that and just,  you know, realized that I didn't have another one in me.  Um, and, um, so to try to, you know, to try to still be able to get married, but not be 
[03:14:00]  financially penalized if she started drinking again.  And I wanted, you know, right to, to, to leave, I wanted something written into a, into  the prenup and, and, uh, you know, you can't really protect yourself in that way.  So we're just, we just put all of that on hold for now on.  She was refusing.  Yeah.  And it was weird because there's a scene in the, in the show, which where she's crying,  worrying about you being, uh, killed for, for when you're going on dance with the stars 
[03:14:30]  because of, of this, this psychotic hatred of this.  Um, was she drinking in that scene?  It seemed like she might've had a few.  I don't think so.  That seemed like a drunk cry.  That's like, uh, you know, I mean, I never fully know because you can't really ever know,  but according to Jen, she hasn't, she hasn't had a drink in, in a long time, but I think  she was just really stressed out by that point.  And, um, and it, it just really freaked her out.  Has sex changed at all?  Like, uh, from your point of view or from hers, like the actual, what you, what you would 
[03:15:00]  do or how you would approach it?  Um, I, I think only in that I'm probably a little, uh, you know, more comfortable also  sexually too, but I'm just physically, you know, everything having to do with my body,  I'm more comfortable.  So, and more present.  Yeah.  So naturally you'd be more comfortable mentally.  Exactly.  As a guy, how do you get around not having a penis though?  Um, you just get around it. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, you know, it's not the ideal.  I would rather have a penis, but you know.  So would Jimmy.  Yeah.  Well, you know, some of us have funded a lot of, uh, transgendered friends.  Yeah.  The way it's through college on the other side.  You know, you just, you just deal.  Do you, but if you have a penis made, um, can you, does it still feel like, can you come  like from just having sex?  Yeah.  So there's, there's, um, there's a few different options.  Like I was saying, there's lots of different options and, and, um, you know, the one that 
[03:16:00]  I, you know, if I do, it will probably do is called a, a metoidioplasty and, and basically  they use, um, uh, you know, kind of what you already have because testosterone makes  your clitoris grow significantly and it really starts to work like a penis and the fact that  it gets erect when you get aroused.  And, um, so it's, it, it becomes almost like a little penis.  So they, they use that and they've, you know, and they, that you make, you know, uh, essentially 
[03:16:30]  a small penis out of it.  How big can you get it?  Um, you know, I mean, that really depends on biology and, and all of that kind of stuff.  I mean, everything with testosterone, you know, how it affects you is, is all, um, genetic.  Is that why female bodybuilders, cause I love, I love large clits on women.  I think it's really sexy.  I don't like them to have a big penis, but I like a big clit and female bodybuilders have  great clits.  Cause they're on testosterone.  That's why.  But that's a good question.  How big in general is there like a three inches or can you go up to it? 
[03:17:00]  Can you, yeah.  Is there a limit to it?  Is there a limit?  You know, I mean.  There's gotta be a range at least.  Yeah.  I mean, there probably is.  I don't, I, I, um, yeah, probably about, you know, three, four inches probably tops.  Um, and, uh, and so that, you know, that would probably be the option that, that I'll go with  because even though you end up with something smaller, it's, you know, it's totally you,  you feel, you know, you feel everything and you don't have to use pumps and stuff. 
[03:17:30]  You don't have to use a pump exactly or anything like that.  And, uh, you know, they can make it so that you can urinate through it standing up.  Wow.  And I, I, I, well, you, you came into the restroom and I did and, uh, you know, I didn't want  to go, hi, Chaz, you know, cause I was pissing.  But, um, is it, is there something when you walk into like a male restroom and you're  like, I would love to just be able to do that?  Like, like, like seriously, like it's a very guy oriented thing.  Um, yeah, I think so.  But I mean, I'm pretty comfortable at this point.  Um, you know, the, the first, at first when I started going into the men's room, I was 
[03:18:00]  a little nervous.  And then until I realized that men don't, aren't even aware of other guys doing anything.  So it's like, I felt like, oh my God, they're going to be like, he's sitting and he's not  taking a shit.  What's going on?  You know?  And then I realized guys don't give a shit.  There's no cameras.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  So, um, but yeah.  I mean, it would nice, you know, just even just from a practical point of view, because  lots of men's rooms are quite disgusting.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, it would be nice to not have to sit down and be able to be standing up. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Dancing with the stars.  Do you think they treated you fairly?  Um, yeah, I think for the most part, I mean, I felt like I got underscored a little bit  compared to some of the other people, but, um, do you think maybe they didn't want you  to be the winner?  Like maybe there's an underlying unspoken?  Well, no, I don't think I could have ever.  I mean, they're people that are better dancers.  So if I, you know, I wanted to go as far as I could go, but I mean, I think if I had  won the whole thing, I would have been like, wait a second.  Yeah.  Guys, come on.  There's better dancers.  You had a good run.  You were good though.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  I had a good run, man.  Once in a while, there was one thing you did, like you did a good dance.  And then there was one thing you did that was like, it was like, cause you, you dance  very masculine and there was one thing you did that was very girly.  I forget.  It was walking down the steps.  There was one moment where you're like, yeah, that, oh my God, that was like, a little bit  of, a little bit of girl came out.  Yeah, a little bit came out.  On walking down the steps?  Yeah, yeah.  The walking down the steps is hard because, um, you don't have any railing.  The girl does on the other side has the rail and there's a camera that you're supposed 
[03:19:30]  to be looking at, but you don't want to fall and people have fallen before.  And then my knee got injured.  And so walking, walking up steps wasn't so bad.  Walking down steps was excruciating.  Yeah.  So now I'm like walking down the steps, trying not to fall, trying not to show that I'm in  pain.  So yeah, I'm sure it's probably not my, my greatest moments.  What's the hardest part to shred of being, uh, a female into a male?  The hardest habit to shred or the hardest behavior, the hardest mannerism? 
[03:20:00]  I don't think, I mean, I don't think I had a lot of female behaviors beforehand.  That's, that's, you know, the thing.  I mean, I felt internally male beforehand.  Well, you just did by the way.  People can't see, but as you're talking, you kind of grabbed your face and you're rubbing  your chin.  Like that's an absolute guy thing to do.  Women don't do that.  So, um, yeah, I, uh, yeah.  So, I mean, I don't think like anything like that really changed.  I think, you know, maybe the only difference, you know, between me and, and, you know, guys  that were born male, I think I have a, probably a slightly, I don't even want to say that. 
[03:20:30]  I was going to say a slightly better understanding of women, but really I don't understand them.  Do you find them more irritating now than you did before?  I can, you know, everything is, is, uh, slightly more irritating than it was before.  So, um, but, uh, but I think I might have a little bit more respect for women, you know,  and I root for women a lot, um, probably than the average guy, just cause I know how hard 
[03:21:00]  it is.  Did you go through the, uh, some of the things normal adolescent girls go through, uh, you  know, the, the, the first period, uh, did you have sex with a man at some point in your  life?  A one time I did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess that didn't work out terrible.  Um, did you puke afterwards?  No, it was just, it was just, um, not, didn't just feel right.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's like if a guy blew you, you'd, you know, and you close your eyes, right.  Chaz, if you only knew who you were talking to. 
[03:21:30]  Preach to the choir.  Yeah.  But, so it just didn't, you know, it just didn't feel, it didn't feel right.  All of a sudden, they closed their eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you'd be surprised, I was surprised at how actually right it did feel.  Well, I guess the wig works.  Here's some money.  And the, um, the show, because Chaz used to go, um, is called, uh, Being Chaz, and I  really was annoyed.  I couldn't watch the whole thing.  I'm going to watch it.  I'll watch it.  On November 27th.  I know, but I like to know beforehand.  Oh, Jimmy.  Just so I can feel like I'm in the know and feel important. 
[03:22:00]  And Chaz Bono on Twitter.  But I knew you'd be a fun interviewer, and, uh, yeah, Chaz, you're great, man.  Thank you.  Very cool.  Absolutely fascinating.  Yeah, it really is an interesting, very confused by this whole thing.  You're, you're just, no, I'm trying to, you're like, you know, I'm just trying to, I'm just  trying to learn, you know, I don't, I don't, it's very confusing.  Do you consider yourself a straight man now?  I do, yeah.  But you used to consider yourself a lesbian.  Yeah, but I was mistaken.  Yeah, I know, I'm trying to wrap my head around that.  Because what I, when I was, because I, I knew about gay and lesbian people growing up. 
[03:22:30]  I didn't know about transgender people, and when I hit puberty, I was like, oh, I find  women attractive.  And so I thought, okay, that must be what this feeling different is.  And then it took me many years.  But, you know, the best way to understand it is to just try to imagine how you would  feel if tomorrow you woke up feeling exactly like you do, but in a female body, how insane  that would be.  Oh.  And what it would feel like to have everybody around you treating you like a woman, but  you know that you're a guy inside.  I'd be in bed for a while. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  Just toying with myself.  That's what being transgender feels like.  I'd be diddling myself for a week.  That's how I feel when I'm shirtless in the mirror.  Fucking.  Yeah, could you, could you give Jimmy your doctor's name?  I'm really wrapped in fucking body self-hatred.  All right, I got one more bizarre question.  Uh-oh.  So, you know, you are a straight guy now, right?  Yeah.  But you, you got a, you got a vagina.  I do.  Does that, like, turn you on now?  Not at all.  Well, because I know it's yours, but.  Yeah, it's mine.  No.  But that's the part we're all in search of. 
[03:23:30]  And you got it on your own body.  Yeah, no.  No, because I really don't want it on my, I mean, I really, I, you know, I really want  to have a penis.  And, and, you know, it's something that I will do.  It's just a really serious surgery.  And, and, you know, you're fucking around with, with, you know, you're, where you get  sexual pleasure.  So you want to really make sure that it's done right.  Sure.  Carefully.  Yeah.  Last question I have.  Are your orgasms any different now than they were feeling wise?  I, they feel a little bit more intense now. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, they are?  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you find now that, like, you just want to get up and leave as soon as you're finished?  I do, actually.  Completely, you're a guy.  Cuddle, schmuddle.  Yeah, and my girlfriend loves to cuddle, so it's, yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to find that more and more irritating.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Chaz, it was great.  I mean, you're really, you're really open and really interesting.  And I wish you a lot of luck.  Yeah, fascinating.  Great interview.  Yeah, watch the show.  Being Chaz, Sunday the 27th at nine o'clock.  If you can't watch it, make sure you DVR'd, because it looks really great from what I saw. 
[03:24:30]  Absolutely.  And we're done?  I think we're done.  Jimmy, you got something to plug?  Oh, God, yeah.  One quick plug.  This weekend, I'm in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  And then January 15th, you can see myself, Artie Lang, Doug Stanhope, and Dave Attell  at the Borgata Event Center.  The first show is sold out.  The Sunday show, tickets I think are still available for.  It's the night before Martin Luther King's birthday.  All right.  So come to the Borgata and see us.  Thanks, Jimmy.  See you guys tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  Thanks, Chaz.  Bye-bye.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. 
[03:25:00]  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  After O&A Live is next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  The show's still on.  We're still here.  Well, not still on.  It's the new show now.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms. 
[03:25:30]  Trojan.  America's number one most trusted condom brand.  And two days in a row, Slowpoke Opie is still here.  Jim Norton is still here.  Yes.  Jim Norton's going to piss and tape the bone yard.  I like the fact that you know better than to even try to stand where Opie is sitting.  Yeah.  I like the fact that you don't even try to weasel your way over there.  But you got exclusive.  You got the two parts of Grim in the morning.  That's right.  You got Grim in the morning right now.  I forgot about Grim in the morning.  You got Grim in the morning.  Remember Greg and Jim turns into Grim.  Grim in the morning. 
[03:26:00]  I thought Jam in the morning was good because it went well with your toast.  What goes better with toast than Jam in the morning?  Jim and Sam.  I got it.  Trying to market us to a different audience.  What?  I liked Chaz Bono's interview there.  You did?  Yeah, absolutely.  It was fascinating.  I like that you got off your question about whether or not she was attracted to herself  because we're all looking for pussy, but she's got it on her body.  She's got like a travel size with her at all times.  That kind of made sense.  It made sense to me.  That's why I thought it was just... 
[03:26:30]  Dude, if I was like that, I would be staring at my pussy all day.  Look at this thing.  It's like Ant said.  But you would have to stare at just the pussy.  You'd have to get like a special mirror on the floor.  Right.  So you're like, holy shit, there's some pussy right there.  Right there.  I already have some.  It's not a dumb question.  I know.  I've been dumber.  I know you've been dumber.  I didn't say it was.  I've been a lot dumber than that.  You're right.  But no, it's the same thing as Ant said.  You know, if I had my mind and I were in a girl's body, I'd be diddling myself all the  time.  I mean, let's ask this seriously, though. 
[03:27:00]  Aren't you turned on by your vagina?  Because I'm a guy who likes vaginas.  I would just, like, if I was, all right, let me see.  If I was a girl.  Right.  You're a girl.  Now a guy had a vagina still in my body, but I'm growing a beard now like Chaz, but I  shaved my pussy my entire life.  I'm working this out live on the air for you.  Sure.  Go for it.  I would now make sure I have a really hairy pussy so it looks completely foreign.  So now I'm a guy with this, holy shit, look at this hairy pussy.  Nice.  Now, is that to say that you're turned on by hairy vagina so you'd grow it that way? 
[03:27:30]  Or you're not?  No, just to make it different.  So whatever, like.  Oh, I got you.  Because you're changing.  Whatever hairstyle as a woman, but I'm now a guy, but I still have the vagina.  At least let's grow some hair so it's a different vagina.  Whatever.  Make a hardship.  Whatever you have to do.  Because now it looks absolutely like a foreign vagina on your now manly body.  I understand.  Because Chaz Diddy had a nice shaved vagina, whereas Chaz has a hairy bush.  Well, we don't know.  But that's the theoretical hypothesis that we're calculating. 
[03:28:00]  You would have to think if you're a girl now, you're a guy, but you still have the vagina,  you would make it very hairy.  Or unless it was hairy before, in which case you'd shave it bald.  Because the hairy thing is associated with being a guy, right?  Well, not hairy vagina.  No, most guys don't have hairy vaginas.  Most guys don't have hairy vaginas?  No, most guys actually have penis and balls.  Most.  Most guys in general don't like, you know, shave it up too much.  Right.  No, no, no.  You might clean it up a little bit, but you're going to make sure there's some hair down there 
[03:28:30]  to go, look, see, I'm a fucking man.  Well, they call it manscaping, and it's still a little swishy, if you know what I mean.  All right.  But now that I'm, uh...  Like, for instance...  Now that I'm Chuck Bono, let's say.  Chuck Bono...  Her name was Chaz, actually.  You just did an interview with her.  No, I'm just saying Chuck, though, as in, okay, look, I'm obviously the man version  of what I was born as.  Right.  I go hairy vagina.  Like, think about it this way.  Hairy vagina, hairy asshole.  Troy does a lot of...  Very hairy asshole.  I don't know if she...  Or maybe bleached just to clean everything up. 
[03:29:00]  Because maybe it was hairy before, so now she's going to shave and bleach the asshole.  But the asshole's completely out of the game now as a guy.  Not necessarily.  Because she's not going to be popped in the shitter.  She might get a finger up there.  Because now she's a guy, a straight guy.  She might get a finger or a tongue in it.  So I would say let the hair grow in around the asshole and full bush.  But here's the thing.  A guy like, for instance, Troy does a lot of manscaping.  So that's why I say it's still a little considered a bit swishy.  This is the segue I was waiting for.  That means I get to sneak out and continue the conversation with Troy. 
[03:29:30]  We're all discussing here.  What do you think, Troy?  Why is that...  Does she let the...  I mean, does he, Chaz Bono, let the pussy hair grow in now?  Wild.  I'm going with wild.  Like an animal.  Yeah.  I would probably say.  You think so?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But she probably shaves her asshole.  Because it sucks to have a hairy asshole.  Yeah, but how does one shave one's asshole?  You don't shave your asshole?  No.  I don't man...  Really, you don't?  You've never shaved your asshole?  No, I've never shaved my ass... 
[03:30:00]  How do you not have dingleberries?  I wipe.  Yeah, but you don't get shit trails?  What is he talking about?  Opie, do you shave your asshole?  I've been in radio since I was 18.  And this is just horrible.  It's come down to this.  It's come down to this, and the fact that Anthony basically did a live read for cougars wanting cock.  I really thought my career would be at a different stage at this point.  I don't know what you're talking about, shaving assholes.  Yeah, we got libraries for prostitution, and now cougars that want cock.  And shaving assholes.  But we're not allowed to have guys drink eggnog. 
[03:30:30]  They can eat mashed potatoes.  They can eat mashed potatoes, though.  Yeah.  Isn't that just fucking eggnog a little thicker?  Yeah, but the rules are different.  What are the rules?  Instead of sitting there and just one after the other, you have a large amount of time.  You have two hours, and you have a set amount.  Stanley T!  Yo, what's up, man?  You like the Muppets, Stanley T?  I thought it was the honest.  There's no one here.  No, no, no.  I'm always honest.  The Muppets had heart.  It had a human heart. 
[03:31:00]  I liked it.  You didn't like it, Oak?  I liked it.  Oh, okay.  A bunch of puppets with human hearts.  I don't like that shit.  No, no.  It had a human heart to it.  I thought it was a very hip.  I don't like that shit.  I thought it was a very hip way to bring in today's youngsters that know nothing about the Muppets back into the fold.  See how cool he is when he's not with the rest of the gang?  Yeah.  You see how cool he is when he's not with the rest of the gang?  See, people don't realize I used to do the Stanley T show back in the day, but that wasn't in his work on that.  Why don't we get back to the Stanley T show?  Yeah, I could do it on the virus.  That would be awesome.  I like the Muppets.  I'm not a family movie type of guy, but I guess now that I'm a father, I better get used to it. 
[03:31:30]  I think Ant may have a problem with the Stanley T show on the virus.  Yeah, pitch it.  I mean, Ant may not be into it.  Oh.  You understand.  Yes, I do understand.  The Opie and Anthony channel.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I got that.  Good point.  You know, because there's not...  I can't bleach my skin.  Michael has already done that.  Are those real rocks in your hair?  Yeah, of course.  Those aren't real diamonds.  What are you, a fucking jeweler?  Are you a fucking Jacob?  No, they're not real diamonds.  Of course there are real diamonds.  These are real, too.  No, they're not.  He doesn't wear everything real.  That's cool.  It's fake.  Imagine me with that on. 
[03:32:00]  I'd look ridiculous.  Yeah, you probably would.  You would have a hammer in here?  Why does a white guy look ridiculous if he wears a necklace like this?  Use a turntable.  Yeah, I see it.  I see what you're doing.  Why are you hating on my jewelry, Sam?  I'm not hating on it.  It looks good, but it's...  Thanks, man.  I need it.  By the way, like half the callers right now that are on the screen, they're all making  jokes about my voice sounding like Chaz Bono's.  Oh, speaking of that.  Or Bono.  Yo, it was so weird.  I was in the bathroom, right?  Right.  And I'm hearing a female voice.  I'm going, what the fuck?  I'm in the bathroom here, and I'm hearing a female voice. 
[03:32:30]  Walk out the bathroom.  It's Chaz.  I was like, whoa.  What's he?  Surgery didn't affect the vocal cords at all, because she sounded very, very feminine.  Y'all had him on your show?  Yes.  Yeah, I heard the woman in that.  Looked pretty manly.  Did look manly, but I'm talking about the voice.  The voice more manly than Sam's.  How do you figure that?  And the only tell was when Chaz smiled for pictures after the interview, I saw a woman.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to have to work on the smile.  You horndog.  You should have seen the way he was looking at Chaz this one, Opie.  What?  He was like, no, I see the woman in there.  No, no. 
[03:33:00]  I saw it.  No, I saw it.  I was pretty amazed by the whole thing.  I was fascinated.  More than amazed.  I saw the way you were looking at him.  She was cool.  Well, there was no reason to beat the shit out of her.  We got some silly questions in there.  Why would anybody think we would beat the shit out of her?  That's what y'all do.  Because that's what they think.  What's up, Jim?  Because they think that's all we do.  We never do that to celebrities.  I'm so sick of people thinking that we're going to beat the shit out of us.  We don't do it as much these days.  Opie was just bringing up there was no reason to beat the shit out of her.  I said there was no reason to go attack Chaz.  She was great.  I wouldn't even think of that.  Some of the people on Feedback, I was watching them, they thought, we never attack celebrities 
[03:33:30]  for no reason.  Not so much anymore.  As for what?  Like, he was cool.  I mean, I'll say he, who cares?  Right.  He was nice.  And I saw other interviews.  He was forthcoming.  He was like, everything, most of these dumb celebrities aren't.  There was no reason to be anything but nice.  Yeah.  Anyone who thinks that is a fucking phony maverick and you think you're saying, hey, you're fucking  whatever, it would have been edgy radio.  It's stupid.  Yeah.  It's dumb.  If there's a reason, then maybe, but there was no reason.  I don't like going off to easy targets.  It was a great segment on a radio show today. 
[03:34:00]  And you don't invite somebody into the studio like Chaz Bono and just start shitting on  them for what?  You invited them in.  Yeah.  I think Chaz was interesting.  And look, we don't have any frame of reference for that.  Like, I don't comprehend that.  If Chaz had written, like, the brokabulary or something, maybe she would have gotten shit.  He would have gotten shit on.  A shitty guest day is one thing.  Right.  And I'm mad that he grows a better beard than me.  That's true.  I was thinking that.  Did you notice this all penciled?  It's perfect, man.  But she said that she can't grow the mustache. 
[03:34:30]  And you've got a solid mustache.  That's interesting.  I could grow a fucking stache, but it's not in right now, Sam.  It's in.  Not really.  Where are you at?  Only if you're a hipster.  Well, the hipsters are what brings things in.  As he looks at T-Roy in the studio.  I thought you said I was a hipster.  Because you are a hipster.  He is a hipster.  I read an article on hipsters, how cool hipsters are actually, they're hanging in there.  Longer than the other subgroups that have come on.  Mustaches are in.  Because they're ironic.  Hipsters are on a big time roll.  I think they're up to 15 years, believe it or not.  The punk movie was only a couple years.  Well, hipsters have replaced emo kids. 
[03:35:00]  I fucking read the New York Times this weekend.  I feel smart.  That was a placemat.  That was not the New York Times.  You've got to work on the voice.  Chaz definitely sounded more manly than you.  Wow.  I wouldn't even work on the voice.  This is my voice.  But I'm not fronting.  I mean, that's the production piece you should do.  Chaz, Sam, see who sounds manly.  I'm Sam.  Do the fucking, from the hits one.  Go with it, Troy.  That's your new idea.  Definitely, Troy.  And I guarantee you're going to lose in the fucking voice competition. 
[03:35:30]  It's not a competition, and if it is, I'll win.  You and your mom, losers.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, really?  Well, why don't you keep walking?  Tell your story walking, because it's not going to get any weight here.  By the way, Kenny, if you're listening, I don't need a ride.  Thank you.  Tell that story walking.  Well, Kenny, I need a ride.  So, shoo.  Shoo.  Tell that story walking.  I'm walking.  Walk.  All right.  I'm walking.  Walk.  Walking right the fuck out of this studio.  Get the fuck out of this studio, then.  How great is Stanley T without the rest of those? 
[03:36:00]  I know.  I don't know what he's doing with that.  You're just wasting your time.  They're my peeps, man.  Yeah, but come on.  You know, you're looking around the room at the show you're doing, like, really?  The show should be called Stanley and the Anchors.  Exactly.  Thank you, Jim.  Stan and the Lightweights.  Hey, this is a side note.  What did you think of the fight over the weekend?  I thought Marquez whipped his ass.  I didn't watch it.  Oh, man.  The replay is going to be Saturday.  You're showing your age.  It's MMA now.  It's not boxing.  I like boxing.  But I heard that that was a real, a typical thing in boxing, a typical bullshit boxing 
[03:36:30]  decision.  Because they're trying to preserve that Pacquiao-Mayweather fight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so they won't let Pacquiao lose.  Boxing stinks, though.  And I love great boxers.  Yes.  But they've gotten so fucking, it's laughable, their credibility.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  But I didn't see it.  I would like to see it.  Yeah, it's a good fight.  So they replay it Saturday.  But boxing's credibility has been out the window for years.  I mean, Don King came in and was, you know, getting accused of fixing all these fights.  And it's never come back from that.  He did put all, he, Don King, though, really did take boxing to a weird level. 
[03:37:00]  Because he put together the fucking Battle in Zaire with Foreman and Ali.  Yes, yeah.  Didn't he put together Thriller in Manila, too?  Yes, he did.  Don King did all those.  They started to make big money once he got involved, you know?  Millions and millions of dollars.  Then he started stealing money and taking all the boxers' money.  True that.  And fixing fights because he wanted to make more money.  And he's unflappable.  We've interviewed him a few times.  He's the greatest.  Don King is unflappable.  What about stealing from those boxes?  How could I have stolen from them when I made them money? 
[03:37:30]  This is America, the greatest country.  He really is great.  And he'll start rhyming.  Like, okay, well, if the rhyme scheme works, I guess, yes, you're right.  He's a really smart guy.  And you know he's the ultimate alpha male because he's not intimidated by Mike Tyson or Ali or Foreman or any of these guys.  It's like you look at this guy and he's got this denim rhinestone jacket on, this goofy hairstyle, this big chain.  He's smiling.  He's rhyming.  And you're looking at a guy who's murdered people, too.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's like he's doing this goofy character, and you cannot forget that he doesn't fuck around. 
[03:38:00]  He killed people.  Tyson punched him in the face.  I love hearing that outside the Beverly Hills Hotel at the Beverly Wilshire for stealing from him, he said.  He talked about it in the documentary.  Yeah?  And he called him, like, what do you call him, a reptilian motherfucker?  Which documentary was it?  The one Tyson did with James Tomek, I think.  That was very good.  Wasn't that great?  Very, very good.  Yeah, I cried watching that.  Thriller in Manila was a really good documentary.  Yeah, it shows Ali in an unpleasant light, you know, even though he was, I still think Ali was a much more important guy historically than Frasier. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  Because of what he, you know, he wouldn't go to Vietnam or whatever, and, you know, just he was the greatest.  He was Ali.  Yeah.  But he loved Frasier.  I mean, you talk about Don King and everything.  Ali brought boxing to another level with just his talking.  True.  Like, he was one of the first guys to really talk people into a boxing match, you know?  They wanted him to get their shit beat.  Right.  And he psyched Sonny Liston.  Sonny Liston was a fucking brutally tough guy, and he had Sonny Liston wanting to murder him so badly that he just couldn't fight his fight. 
[03:39:00]  But, I mean, Ali, he psyched out Sonny Liston.  He psyched out Foreman.  The greatest of all time.  Yeah.  Was that Count Chocula or Muhammad Ali?  That was Muhammad Ali.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't sure.  It sounded very similar.  I wouldn't be talking too much, and Chaz got you beaten the balls department with a voice.  Don't worry about that.  You do sound like a 12-year-old girl.  Don't worry about that.  Well, at least I'm not doing impressions, okay?  Don't worry about what I sound like.  The greatest of all time.  Yeah.  Was that bad?  That's Count Chocula.  Okay, that's what you about.  That sounded like somebody, that sounded like a deaf person.  Ali got boxed in the ears a few too many times. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, Stanley's Ali impression needs a lot to be desired.  So what do you got going on?  Troy and I are going to go into the other room.  Ooh, I like where this is going.  Yeah, we do a little of lathering each other up with scented oils, and we do a little taping.  It's nothing sexual.  You just hug and touch legs.  And Jim farts a lot.  You do?  I love gassing in that little studio.  We were talking about your gassers the other day on this show.  As you should be.  They should be with who?  With your family?  No.  Yeah, going home over dinner.  Nagel, the sex man, he gets all pissed when you go in there pretending to look for somebody 
[03:40:00]  and then just pass gas in the room.  That's fair enough.  Shut the door.  I can't be mad at him for not liking that.  But he says that you always respond in surprise and say, enjoy it.  I love that for you.  Yeah, why do you fight it?  Why don't you just be grateful?  How about a thank you?  Exactly.  Jim, do you enjoy your own farts when you saw them?  Yeah, I mean, I recognize they're putrid, but they're mine.  They don't offend me.  Right.  But Troy says that he Dutch ovens himself, like he farts under the covers.  What do you mean we all do?  No, we don't.  Shut up.  We do.  I've actually had to fart and waited until I got under the covers. 
[03:40:30]  And I love to elbow it up and just go like, I wish people were here to fucking enjoy this.  I've never done it.  And, Jim, do you shave your own asshole?  I don't need to.  But I don't shave my asshole.  I shave my pubes sometimes a little bit under.  But I'm not a hairy guy.  How do you...  They're trying to bust my balls about shaving my asshole.  How do you shave your asshole?  Doesn't it itch?  No.  No.  Not really.  With what, though?  You take soap, you lather it up, and then you just take the razor and get in there.  I'd be so worried about cutting my asshole. 
[03:41:00]  I got this shit down to a science.  Maybe you could do it for me sometime.  Once a week.  Doesn't it start to itch after a few...  Like, if I shave under my balls, it starts to feel prickly because I'm very skin sensitive.  A little bit.  Just put a little talcum powder on there.  That's okay.  Yeah.  Can you show me how to shave an asshole sometime?  I mean, if you really want to see, sure.  Well, I don't trust myself with the razor not to cut something.  You understand?  It's just good, man.  Just got to go late.  I shave my sack, too.  You shave everything?  Yeah.  Completely?  I trim down the bush area.  But not completely.  Just a trim.  I will. 
[03:41:30]  I have.  Jim, you shave all the hair.  It's fucking...  I'm like a child.  Isn't that creepy to some women?  No.  Makes your dick look better.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And do women like that shit, man?  I don't know what the fuck you're coming from, but chicks like when you groom yourself.  Yeah, but when you shave all hair off.  Yeah, it doesn't stink.  There's no fucking hair in their mouth.  They just like...  It's all cock.  Look at all this cock.  Yeah, they're all grateful.  Like, oh, for Pete's sake, it's a cock fest.  Yeah.  I love it.  None of this pesky hair getting in my way.  Yeah, none of this fucking Neanderthal throwback nonsense.  We don't need it. 
[03:42:00]  And what happens if you've got a broad tooling around back there?  You wouldn't have to be clean, right?  Well, no, I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea.  I use soap and water and wash my undercarriage.  Yeah, well, as if you have a long day and you meet a broad out at the fucking, you know,  whatever.  Yeah, you don't have that hair kind of catching all the sweat and the...  Well, as you called them, dingleberries throughout the day.  Do you have a sweaty...  Do you have a hairy asshole?  Not specifically, but it's not shaved.  I mean, I don't have a lot of body hair, so...  Right, me neither.  You know.  I don't have a lot of...  I have an excessive amount of body hair, so I have to make sure...  Thick body hair?  Yeah, I have to trim that shit down.  What, shave your arms? 
[03:42:30]  I veet my arms.  What's veet?  Veet is like nair.  It's like just a lotion.  You put it on and you jump in the shower and it comes off.  Does it work?  Oh, wow, really?  Yeah.  Is that good for you?  I mean, I don't know if it's good for you, but it's like burning the hair off, but it's  fine.  It doesn't make it be bad.  I tried to use that hair lotion on my face once because I get razor burns.  Yeah.  But, I mean...  Most black people do.  It's the most horrible, uneven thing that's ever happened.  I would never do it again.  All you gotta do is just go in a steamy shower and then shave in the shower.  You won't get that anymore.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How do you get razor burns?  It's my hair is coarse. 
[03:43:00]  So, when you have coarse hair, it curls.  It just starts growing under the skin.  How do you get rid of that?  Well, I went to a dermat...  I have to start shaving with a single razor blade because the multiple razors pull at  your hair and that's what irritates it.  And I got some lotions and stuff that I'm going to...  A single razor?  Yeah.  I mean, you said...  Like the straight ones the barbers used to use in the 40s?  No, like a disposable Bic razor that just has one blade on it.  That's a little worse.  Those hurt.  I know.  They're not...  It's not... 
[03:43:30]  You can't have a close shave.  Like, if you have...  That's what happens.  When your shave is too close, you start to grow ingrown hairs.  When you have hair like me.  Or black people.  Have you tried to get it steamy in the shower?  Yeah, I've tried tons of stuff.  I mean, I cannot shave at all if I'm not immediately out of the shower.  Does it hurt when you shave over the bumps?  Uh...  If they're bad...  Like, if I shaved without showering first.  Like, if I wasn't right out of the shower.  If I waited 15 minutes after I showered to shave, then it would hurt.  Then it would be dry.  Then things...  I couldn't do it. 
[03:44:00]  Why don't you just shave in the shower?  Just get a shower mirror, you fucking creep, and shave in there.  I'd say, like, immediately when I get out of the shower, it's still wet and steamy.  No, it's hot.  Steamy.  You splash in hot water, like, under your neck.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean...  You know, it's starting to work, what I'm doing.  With a single razor blade.  Let me see under your neck.  Yeah, it looks a little bit better.  It's better than it was.  I mean, it's been bad.  It goes up and down.  Sometimes, even when you grow it out a little bit, it helps.  Hmm.  All right, I'm bored.  Wow.  Well, I hate to bore you.  No, no, no.  It was good for a first 30-minute dissertation on your fucking neck. 
[03:44:30]  Again, this is things that you asked.  You know, and it will...  You have plenty of time left in this show, too.  I got plenty of stuff to do here.  Maybe...  Like what?  Well, I'm going to talk about the big hard rock event that's on Thursday.  Yes.  Let's talk about my tickets for Harrisburg, the Funny Bone, this weekend.  I'm working on material.  The material's pretty ready for my special, which I'm shooting in, I want to say it's  March.  Mm-hmm.  Is it difficult to do East Coast shows when you're trying to work out material and the 
[03:45:00]  audience is just asking for you to do chip?  No, they don't yell chip at all.  I don't ever fall into the radio trap.  Like, when I want to do radio stuff, I do it.  Okay.  But they don't...  If they start yelling chip, I'll just ignore them and make fun of them.  But I'll do chip towards the end.  I like doing chip.  Yeah.  But not in the beginning of the show because I'm, you know...  You're doing a show.  Yeah.  And there's people there, even when there are people yelling, there's a lot of people  who don't know what you're doing.  Yeah.  Like, why are you talking like that?  I pointed out how much fun it is to just all of a sudden just ruin their night.  It's caught on like wildfire. 
[03:45:30]  Chip?  Oh, yeah.  It's fucking the be-all, end-all in life.  My favorite is when friends that I have who listen to the show tell me that they're  either doing it to their friends or their loved ones who don't listen to the show.  And so all of a sudden, you're just doing a weird voice and making bad jokes, and it's  like, what are you talking about right now?  Why are you doing this?  When are you going to upload the last chip thing?  Was it that bad?  Oh, no, no, no.  I keep slipping my mind.  I'll do it this week.  We should have a couple out of that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We filmed at New York Comic Con.  The last one that was online was from San Diego Comic Con. 
[03:46:00]  I need a new look, though, because people recognize me.  A lot.  In New York, yeah.  Yeah, we need a chip outfit.  A mustache.  Maybe some kind of movie makeup.  A fake nose.  Oh.  At least a haircut.  Something.  Yeah, a mullet.  I think a chip.  I actually think a chip should have a little bit of baldness in the front, like a mullet.  Almost like a Dwight Yoakam in fucking Sling Blade cut.  And a mustache.  You've got to rock a mustache.  You've got to have a mustache.  Yeah, absolutely.  Fake one, though. 
[03:46:30]  I don't grow mustaches.  Why not?  It's not in my DNA.  Oh.  I'm talking about a fucking creep.  That's why.  Only creeps have mustaches.  And chips?  Chip's kind of a creep.  Yeah.  So it would work.  Yeah.  Waking up a mustache, your mustache.  I don't know.  I just messed up.  What does that even mean?  Is Chip going to be part of the Thanksgiving recital at the Hard Rock on Thursday?  It better be.  I'm a good actor.  I'm going to come right out and go, what, are you giving out turkeys or something?  I'm a pilgrim.  Where's John Wayne? 
[03:47:00]  I got a whole bunch of lines ready.  Why don't you just, maybe we'll write the script to you.  I'm going to say, you're welcome giving.  It's Thanksgiving.  Get everybody cracking up.  That's not good.  It's funny.  That's not funny at all.  I guess then Chip will be a part.  Oh.  Who did that, Rowan?  Rowan.  Good for you, Rowan.  Yeah.  Good for you.  It smells like Fartmeister.  What's a Fartmeister?  I don't know.  Travis, is Chip down?  Is he on the cast list for this play?  Yeah.  He is?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:47:30]  You're not a pilgrim, though, Chip.  I better be a pilgrim.  Because I got pilgrim pride.  My mother would always say, don't you be no Indian, Chipper.  Well, your mother's going to be really disappointed.  What is he?  He's an Indian.  Oh, Chip, you're an Indian.  Am I going to do like woo-woo all over the place?  Woo-woo.  Yeah.  Make it rain.  My mother used to say, don't go woo-wooing around the house and make it rain, Chipper.  And then her African friends would come over, help her put a floor down in her bedroom.  How many floors did she need to put down in the bedroom?  A lot more than I would have thought.  I would imagine, too.  Yeah. 
[03:48:00]  Nick and Buffalo, I'm in the same boat.  Single Bic blades worked wonders.  Oh, really?  So.  Wow, okay.  I never would have thought that.  I wouldn't have either.  I had to go to a professional to seek help.  I never.  Jess made me go to a dermatologist.  She was sick of it, right?  You dumb, bumpy neck.  I guess so.  She said she wanted it cleared up before the wedding.  Of course she did.  Who wants to see a fucking bumpy redneck zilch in a fucking tux?  She also, she's so delusional that she said, consider this an investment in your future.  Because I'll bet someday you'll be working in television and you'll need clear skin. 
[03:48:30]  Aw.  Jess really does tell the company line, doesn't she?  I go, look, Jess.  You don't need to worry about that.  I got, I'm barely scratching by on the radio.  Yeah.  I don't know what network she thinks is going to run over and snatch you up.  Well, maybe Tina Fey.  I don't know what she's working on.  My mom's got her brainwashed, I guess.  What about the new WWE Network?  I've been, look, WWE Network knows that I'm beyond interested in working for them.  Triple H came in here for a quote-unquote interview and it turned into me pitching myself for a job on SiriusXM's airwaves, okay? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, but you wouldn't leave this company to go work for the WWE.  Yes, I would!  Why would you say something like that?  Of course I would, in a heartbeat.  You would?  Yes!  I mean, that's not to say I want to leave or anything, but yes.  If the WWE Network was like, hey, we have an on-air position, we have this show that we think you'd be good for, or we want to use your idea for this show, you'd be a good host, blah, blah, blah.  Why couldn't you do both?  I would do both.  You'd have to give them up.  I would love to do both. 
[03:49:30]  That would be my ideal thing.  What about an unpaid internship?  Leave here for an unpaid internship?  Yeah.  I probably wouldn't because I think that's not so much a pipe dream.  I could probably figure out a way to secure it.  Yeah, but look what an internship got you here.  Yeah, but I'm 28 years old now.  It only took you five years.  It didn't take me five years.  I was hired here within a year and a half.  You would be a good host on them.  They're dumb if they don't use you.  I think so, too.  And wrestling's dumb either way.  Convincing them.  I agree.  They don't have a lot of black eyes, though.  I'm not a black guy. 
[03:50:00]  Well.  Although I am ethnically ambiguous, which my ex-girlfriend, who was black, her mom said that was very in, being ethnically ambiguous.  You know why Travis hates wrestling?  Or thinks it's dumb?  Why?  I'll tell you.  Because you like to take shots.  You've got to bring it up every week.  Travis thinks that wrestling is dumb because he was a wrestling fan.  And the biggest wrestling show ever was the last episode of Nitro when the WWE was taking it over.  And so he came home all ready to watch it. 
[03:50:30]  He was thinking about his snacks already in his head.  He was really pumped for this big show.  And he said, where's mom?  Oh, well, almost.  Oh, okay.  He walks in the door.  And three minutes before this big wrestling show starts, his mother and father say, we have something to tell you.  And they sit him down and let him know they're getting divorced.  And he missed his wrestling show.  I never got to see it.  I wasn't forward thinking and I didn't, you know, record it on the VCR at the time.  Were you thinking about it when they told you or no?  After it happened, I thought, oh, great. 
[03:51:00]  I'm missing this.  Because I was really excited to see it.  I'd rather hear my parents are getting divorced than be forced to watch that show.  I think you won in that proposition.  They did you a favor.  But now he can't even go back to watch it again, to re-watch it.  Because he thinks to himself, oh, yeah, I remember all the pain I was going through when my parents told me they were getting divorced.  No, I could totally go back and watch it.  Have you watched it?  No.  Why don't you?  Just to do it.  Watch it.  To get out of your system.  You want a tape of it?  Have a good cry.  I never really think about it.  How many times have you cried over your mom being gone? 
[03:51:30]  Zero.  Come on, not once have you cried over that?  No.  Even when you were young, when she first left?  Not like now.  Now you're over it.  Maybe she had written you off.  When she was like, I'm going with this Jew.  No, when I realized that she had written me off, it was more anger than sadness.  So you didn't cry out of anger?  Maybe.  Anger is only a mask for sadness.  Yeah, maybe towards the beginning.  Maybe.  Yeah.  I honestly don't remember, but I'll assume that I did once or twice.  Do you have any outbursts of anger?  No.  Like, violent?  Well, I mean, smashing something. 
[03:52:00]  It doesn't have to be beating your shit up.  No.  You see a Jew, you just start pulling and boom.  Yeah.  You ruined my family!  No, I'm never.  You and that big, delicious Yiddish cock.  No, never.  Never?  No.  You didn't even, like, yell at somebody, even though they didn't do anything wrong,  because you were frustrated about your mother abandoning your family?  I do that all the time.  Still to this day, your wife just does something completely innocent, and he's snapping her  because you're still upset about your mom.  Daughter, too.  Your daughter.  Look what I made the...  Shut up! 
[03:52:30]  You'll leave me just like she did!  Travis, it's no way to live.  By the way, thank you on instant feedback.  Or the phone.  Someone says I'm in the comedy zone in Harrisburg.  Yes, I am.  What did you say?  That was it.  Oh.  Is there something...  Is it hard to find the information for your show this weekend?  Because I had a friend that was like, I can't find the information for Jim's show.  What are the fucking Harrisburg Comedy Zone?  Oh, I said find the comedy zone in Harrisburg.  Look at that.  Just Google Comedy Zone, Harrisburg.  Yeah, just Google Jim Norton, Harrisburg.  How many fucking hits do you think are going to come up?  Is it on there already?  Is it listed on the website?  HarrisburgComedyZone.com 
[03:53:00]  You don't have a Facebook or anything that you keep updated with your gigs?  I do, but I need my website fixed.  I'm on Twitter.  It's weird with the radio show.  You can get information out there.  Between Twitter and the radio show, there's so many ways to get information out there.  You're just not motivated to put it on the website because it's getting out there.  You look at Louie's site and all these other guys.  The site is just so central to what they're doing.  It's really smart.  At least do a Facebook fan page.  Yeah.  I have one already.  Is it a fan page where you can put the dates?  Yeah, I didn't start it, but I do run it. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, you've got to have some kind of hub where everybody can go to get what they need.  That's true.  Yeah, but you've got to do it right.  The Jim Norton brand.  Bob Kelly redesigned his website last month, and all of his dates are hidden at the bottom.  You've got to scroll down.  They belong.  Exactly.  I want my website to be a beehive of activity.  Bob Kelly's dates were at the top, and then everybody just started clicking out of it.  I don't want to waste my time with this info no one needs.  No, you know what, dude?  It's like whenever you scroll over a city, my face pops up with a date.  That's how you want to find out where you are. 
[03:54:00]  It's not going to any of these cities.  Exactly.  So when are you going to get your website back up?  I don't know.  I know it's up now, but it's not.  I don't plug it.  It's good.  It's up to date.  I check it sometimes, yeah.  Yeah, your dates are all there.  Can we see eatabullet.com?  I don't think I like it.  No disrespect to the guys that did it, but I think I wanted to have it more involved.  Well, I can't whisper the password.  I'm on the, see what I mean?  It's okay.  I don't need it.  You do need to keep your celebrity photos up to date, though.  Yeah, I haven't done that in a long time.  I don't know how to update it. 
[03:54:30]  I think a lot of guys, you know, like to see all those pictures.  You think so?  Yeah.  I've been telling you that forever.  Yeah, because, I mean, you're known for that.  I used to go to your website and stuff.  I mean, you don't update anymore, so I don't, but I would, if you updated your celebrity  pictures and put them all online, I'd scroll through them all the time.  I scroll through people.  Anyone that's got a large celebrity Facebook album, I scroll through.  I scroll through Travis's pictures, and they're the same ones that I have.  Do I have to?  Yeah, I scroll through Eric's all the time.  It's huge.  Okay, maybe I'll do that.  People like seeing that stuff. 
[03:55:00]  I have to learn how to upload it myself.  Yeah, that's it.  You've got to get somebody to redesign the website, and then teach you how to update it.  Just do it on your Facebook.  Just create a celebrity photo album on your Facebook.  Let everybody see it.  I don't like relying on Facebook, because I want to own the content.  Like, I don't like relying on them.  I see, okay.  I got what you're saying.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I don't want to have to rely on Facebook.  And you could have, you know, your website should be your thing that then points to Twitter  and Facebook and the radio show and your dates.  Yeah, but the hub, as you should not really put it.  The hub.  It's for the Jim Norton brand.  Yeah.  It's a home for the Jim Norton brand. 
[03:55:30]  For people who want to be in business with Jim Norton.  Exactly.  If you want to find out...  I keep hearing about this Jim Norton.  What's this brand all about?  You go to the hub.  Right.  If we'd like to be in the Jim Norton business, you can go to that hub.  It's a real beehive of activity.  Whether it's dates or videos, they're all here.  All the YouTube.  You can just go to YouTube and Google Jim Norton.  YouTube has changed a lot, too, because it's so easy just to go get the fuck you want to get.  Yeah, but it's like, now you put up your own website, and then you just search your name on YouTube. 
[03:56:00]  They're not your videos, but you just put them on your website.  You know what I mean?  Like, if somebody else has uploaded Jim Norton videos...  I don't know how to do that.  What do you mean stream them?  You mean, like, embed?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can do that.  I don't know what I mean.  Yeah, but do them from YouTube.  You don't want to do them from your site.  That's horrible.  Why?  Because I...  Sites that host their own videos, they never work.  They're always like...  Oh, you need a lot of bandwidth?  Yeah, you go to YouTube, and you get the...  That way accounts go up and everything.  Yeah, come on. 
[03:56:30]  Who's coming in?  I think Larry the Cable guy is here.  Oh, is Larry here?  Okay.  Travis.  I'm looking to try.  Make some room for...  Where's Larry the Cable guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Larry's going to have to find his own mic, because I'm here.  There's a mic right here, Sam.  I'm sure I didn't even see that.  I'll talk to Larry.  That's right by where you broke the chair.  Here he comes.  Remember when you broke that chair?  Yeah, that was yesterday.  That was hilarious.  I'm on one day, no broken chairs.  Yeah.  It's Larry the Cable guy doing his dawdling.  He's supposed to be coming on after Open Anthony Live.  He's talking to the broads.  I don't blame him.  Bring him in, Roland. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, come on in.  What are you doing?  Bring him in.  He's yapping.  Talking to chicks.  He's just dawdling.  Yeah, he is dawdling.  Larry the Cable guy.  Welcome to the show.  We're live.  Come on in.  Who are all these chicks?  We're on now.  We're just going to wrap it up.  How are you doing, buddy?  Doing good, brother.  How are you doing?  Good to see you, man.  Good.  Good to see you.  What's happening?  We saw you on TV.  What are these chicks?  What?  Are you kidding me?  Look at me.  You don't think I'm going to have chicks following me?  I'm just saying.  Are they traveling with you?  I mean, square jaw, fur, muscular buttocks? 
[03:57:30]  I mean, come on.  I'm the Brad Pitt of the country.  I did notice the buttocks when you were coming in.  Did you?  Guns?  Good arms?  Good arms.  I got the whole thing going on.  Nice smile.  I've been dieting.  Have you?  You know, I've been dieting.  I lost 22 pounds.  My wife got me a trainer, and I lost 22 pounds trying to avoid him.  I never ran so much in my life.  Last time I sweated that much, Jim, I got my wife pregnant.  Sex.  I mean, you know what I'm talking about. 
[03:58:00]  It's unbelievable.  I remember I went in to the dietitian, and he goes, what's your desirable goal?  I said, a B cup.  So I think I've achieved it.  You've got to shrink down those mantids somehow.  What were you doing on Fox News today?  We saw you.  Yes, I was on Fox News.  I was promoting my, I'm doing a thing with Prilosec OTC, and we have teamed up to do a...  For acid reflux Prilosec?  Yes.  Okay, I can't remember. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  But we are doing a tailgate package.  We're trying to find the best tailgaters in the country.  Got a website called tailgatefan.com slash contest.  Now, if you go on there, you send pictures of your tailgate setup, send pictures of your  team spirit, and send pictures of the food you're making for your tailgate.  Now, you've got to send a recipe with the food, but we're giving away, in each category,  two tickets to the Super Bowl.  Oh, wow.  That's a real prize. 
[03:59:00]  That's a pair for each person.  Two tickets to the Super Bowl in each category.  I'll be there February 4th.  They're all going to come up, you're going to show off your tailgating abilities in front  of everybody at the Super Bowl with me, and I'm even throwing in tickets to my shows.  That's great.  That's a real prize.  What does this have to do with Prilosec, though?  Well, it's Prilosec OTC.  It just is.  Well, yeah.  I mean, look, I am a frequent heartburn getter.  Gotcha.  And so who better to plug the words of Prilosec OTC than somebody who has a frequent heartburn 
[03:59:30]  getter?  If it works for you.  It's not prescription Prilosec, which is easier, because I had a prescription one,  but there's always a problem with a stupid prescription.  So Prilosec, you just go in and get, which is a lot easier.  I think you can just take two of them and you're fine.  This is a wonderful, wonderful deal.  You can register for this at tailgatefan.com slash contest.  I mean, you can win tickets to the Super Bowl.  Yeah, which is huge.  Yeah, and you're right, Jim.  And just like you say, it's a real prize.  Right.  I mean, it's not like, you know, you're going to head to the zoo or anything like that. 
[04:00:00]  Possibly win a team jacket or something crap.  A team jacket or a crackpot or something like that.  Yeah.  I mean, this is a real big deal.  Not everybody gets to go to the Super Bowl.  I have never been to a Super Bowl in my life.  Really?  And so this is a good way to be able to get there.  Are you a football guy?  You seem like more of a NASCAR or a racing guy.  But are you big on football?  Yeah, I'm a football guy.  You know, I was going to play college football.  Only one thing kept me from college ball, and that was the high school ball.  So, and other than that, though, I would have made a great player, you know. 
[04:00:30]  But, no, I enjoy football.  I was a baseball fan, really, growing up.  Yeah.  Wasn't that good?  I mean, I did my best.  I struck out one time with the bases loaded in t-ball.  Oh, Larry.  You know, when my dad came up, it would make me feel better.  Sat next to me with a roll of lifesavers and made a fist with them and beat the hell out of me.  I'll never forget that day.  You have to learn somehow.  Never forget that day.  Hey, Jim, you'd appreciate this.  I went cow tipping a couple of days ago.  That's right. 
[04:01:00]  I went to Waffle House.  I went to Waffle House, tipped the waitress 20%, and she fell over.  Big fat Waffle House.  Not only was she large, but it was the biggest tip she ever got.  That's funny.  It just shocked her.  What do you think of all this stuff that's going on on Wall Street right now?  The march on the Occupy Wall Street.  I'm going to tell you, I did my part for the Occupy Wall Street movement today.  You did?  I sure did.  What was that?  I occupied the toilet for an hour and a half.  There you go.  And you talk about a cleanup.  Yeah.  Oh, the park ain't got nothing on me.  I'll tell you.  I ate my beanie weenie casserole, which is a great recipe. 
[04:01:30]  Oh, my Glade plug-in started a carpet fire after that mess.  Unbelievable.  You're dropping giant deuces, were you?  Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy.  You ever fart so hard you iron your pants?  You ever do that?  I mean, it just takes the creases right out of them.  You are.  That's a good way to do it, boy.  I'll tell you.  You're a blue-collar guy, obviously.  I grew up in southeast Nebraska on a pig farm, moved to Florida in 1979, have lived there  for 33 years.  But you're also a very wealthy man because of all the success you've had in comedy. 
[04:02:00]  Are you a 99-percenter or a 1-percenter?  I don't know what I'd be.  I think you're a 1-percenter who relates to the 99% better.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think you're probably right.  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, I haven't really changed my lifestyle that much.  But you don't feel guilty about making a lot of money.  You work.  I mean, you're on stage doing it.  No, not at all.  I worked hard for everything I got.  I mean, I was calling radio stations five days a week for 13 years promoting what I did.  Getting up at 5.30 in the morning, sometimes not ending until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. 
[04:02:30]  I would stay up late at night.  I not only would do my comedy shows, I'd go home when everybody else was going bar hopping.  I went back to the room and I'd sit down and I'd try to think of a couple of commentaries  to write.  And I'd write my commentaries and I'd deliver them in the next morning.  So people always say, oh, you came out of nowhere.  No, you know what?  You've got to work for your success.  I mean, it's not going to get handed to you.  You have to create your opportunities. 
[04:03:00]  Nothing's ever going to come to you.  I mean, I was just like everybody else.  I was struggling just like everybody else.  I didn't start making money until about 15 years ago.  So you would, and this was legendary stuff too, like you would get up and you had like  a bunch of different stations everywhere and you would call like, what would you cycle  every three months before you'd get back to calling the same station again?  No, I, some of them I'd call five days a week.  Oh, wow.  Some of them I'd call three days a week.  And here's the thing about it.  I only got paid for maybe 20% of them, but, uh, you know, uh, comedy clubs at the time, 
[04:03:30]  if you could draw, if you could put seat, put, put butts in seats, you're working, you're  working a comedy club.  And so I would go into these radio stations and they'd go, man, we love what you're doing.  That's hilarious.  We hear your commentaries and we'd love to do it, but we can't afford it.  And then I would say, you ain't got to pay me.  I'll just do it for you.  Be careful.  You say that around here too much.  Well, I'll try to get you to put your name on the side.  Well, that's the thing.  But I told them, I said, you ain't got to pay me.  Here's the deal.  There's a comedy club here.  I'm working with this week. 
[04:04:00]  I'll call you every day, five days a week.  If you want to, all I ask is you promote my show.  Everybody won.  Comedy club didn't really have to promote me.  The radio station promoted me for nothing and everybody was a winner in it.  That's great.  But I did.  It took a long time to get it to catch on and get it to work.  But it's a lot of fun.  I enjoyed it.  I got really good fans and they like what I do.  And it's not like I'm just like, hey, I'm keeping all the, you know, I started a foundation  called the Get Her Done Foundation.  I couldn't have done it without any of my fans.  It's for children's charities. 
[04:04:30]  All the money goes to children's charities and war veterans that come home with head injuries,  head trauma, spinal injuries.  Same with the kids.  Great.  The foundation in a year and a half has donated almost $9 million.  Wow.  How big are the rooms that you play in now?  I mean, obviously you're not doing comedy clubs anymore.  I got to tell you, man, it's been awesome.  I started working arenas in 2004 and I'm still doing theaters and arenas.  I'm still half that. 
[04:05:00]  I'm in arenas 60% of the time.  How do you perform stand-up?  Like I was watching Russell Peters' DVD that he had when he was in it promoted or whatever  and I was just watching him in the O2 arena just performing in front of these thousands  and thousands of people and comedy is like such like a intimate and relatable type of  thing.  How do you...  You know what it really is?  You got to work on your time and your timing's always a little different.  But, you know, the more you do them...  I mean, Jim, you know what I'm talking about.  You do comedy clubs.  You're nervous at first and then you do so many of them. 
[04:05:30]  It's old hat.  You're comfortable.  Then you move into theaters and you're like, holy crap, I'm in theaters.  This is...  But you do 15 to 20 of them.  Now you know how to work the theater.  Just like arenas.  You do it.  You work a few of them.  You get used to it.  You know how to work them so people feel comfortable.  You just learn from the experience.  Is the echo kind of...  There's a weird echo that comes back, right?  Yeah.  A lot of times the echo stinks, especially when you work in an arena and you only do 4,000  tickets.  You got that?  Oh, yeah.  You have that.  But, you know, you cut the room up. 
[04:06:00]  You put a curtain up.  The curtain's right.  But a lot of times, you know, you go into a place and they'll have...  And you know you can do 35,000 to 4,000, 5,000 tickets in a certain area.  They don't have a theater, but they got a basketball arena.  So you'll go in and you'll work a hockey rink.  You'll work a...  You know, so they'll seat 5,000 at the most.  Well, you get 4,000 people in there.  It looks completely full.  So, you know, it's a lot of fun.  It's been a heck of a ride, but I love what I do.  And I got great fans.  And this whole Prada Sec OTC, man, it's going to be fun meeting the people. 
[04:06:30]  I'll get to meet who the winners are January or February 4th at the Super Bowl.  That's amazing.  And hang out with them.  And it's kind of cool to be able to see all that.  Real quick.  Can you wrap it up?  Yeah, I got to tell you.  This is going to sound odd, Larry the Cable guy.  But I got to tell you about Argentium.  Argentium is Steven Singer.  Do you know Steven Singer?  He's this jeweler in Philadelphia.  He's getting to be very widely known now.  I go to him when I need jewelry.  Really?  I would recommend you do, too. 
[04:07:00]  He's got this collection called Argentium, which is a super silver.  Okay?  I think I had that removed, actually.  I think I might have.  Maybe that's where he got it from, because he just popped up with it.  I think of a prostitute from Argentium.  Yeah, right.  She's from Argentium.  It starts at $149.  It's more pure than sterling silver.  It's brighter than platinum, white, gold, and sterling.  It's tarnish-resistant.  It's responsible and ethical, because it's made from recycled silver, which is not a cheap thing.  It's a beautiful thing, because it's the purest of all silvers, and it saves the planet. 
[04:07:30]  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com.  Larry the Cable guy, I'm talking to you.  If you're interested in it, or call him at 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.  Next time you're in the Philadelphia area itself, his store, it's a beautiful store.  He has cookies, he has drinks, he has everything.  It's on the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  So you just go to 8th and Walnut.  His store is the other corner of 8th and Walnut.  So check out Steven Singer.  You don't check him out, just because his website's IHATEStevenSinger.  Exactly.  I mean, that's a good guy right there.  That's a great name, right?  That's what he's banking on. 
[04:08:00]  And where can people go, before we close, because we're leaving here, where can people go to find out about your OTC?  It's tailgatefan.com slash contest, and it tells you everything you need to do on there.  Get your pictures on, it's going to be a heck of a lot of fun.  Well, you can win a trip to the Super Bowl, you can meet Larry the Cable Guy.  Larry, thanks for stopping by, it's always a pleasure.  Hey, thanks for having me, and Jimmy, always good to see you, man.  And you've kept your weight off, I'm proud of you.  I've got to get back down to where you are.  I told you you were looking good, Jim.  Thank you, I still feel like I put a few back on.  I was eating a gyro at 5 o'clock in the morning, and I just staving off the depression of my career stagnation. 
[04:08:30]  So, Larry doesn't know much about that.  He cannot relate to you on any level.  You know what it's like, when you get one into Arena, they become old hat.  I'm thinking, you know what it's like, you pick up one hooker and don't do a good gig, it becomes old hat.  We're in different places, Larry, but I'm happy for you, because I like it.
