<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heavy promotion of their "whipped cream bikini contest," emphasizing the Hawaiian trip prize and addressing listener concerns about participant comfort and privacy.  Opie and Anthony reviewed submitted photos, offering their often crude opinions on the contestants’ attractiveness.  A caller, Steve, complained about other men obstructing his view. This sparked a discussion about women's fashion, specifically spaghetti-strap tops, leading to sexually suggestive banter about breast support and male attraction. A brief, interrupted call mentioned a show fan's appearance on the Jenny Jones show.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a recent Mets game, a fan's sign, and subsequent player incidents. A major segment focused on a heated conflict with another radio station in their company over the use of a Mets broadcaster's clip, resulting in aggressive and vulgar responses from Opie and Anthony.  This spurred numerous listener calls, including conversations about the timing of unexpected erections and further detailed discussions on bra types and how women wear spaghetti-strap tops.  Callers shared personal anecdotes, including a humorous encounter with reality TV contestant Kimmy at an Eddie Bauer store.  A letter from *Time Out New York* detailing a wife's concerns about her cross-dressing husband's desire for breast implants prompted more sexually suggestive humor and marital advice discussions, including a call detailing negative experiences with a support group.  Throughout this section, commercials for ProFlowers.com and Planet Java aired.

Porn star Nikki Sterling then joined the show.  Her career, particularly a specific gangbang scene (involving 18 men), and her English accent were discussed at length.  Sterling participated in the "Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge," setting a new record. Other female guests arrived for the whipped cream bikini contest, and their physical attributes and personalities were commented on. Listener calls, some excited about Sterling's presence, others asking about her films, interspersed the segment.  There was discussion of a marijuana march and casual mention of other drugs.  The hosts continued their sexually explicit jokes and comments, with a recurring gag involving a crew member named "Stinky."  Sponsors and upcoming segments were promoted throughout.

The show moved on to a lengthy segment dominated by listener calls about marriage, divorce, and alimony. The hosts and callers debated the idea of marriage as a lease, renewing periodically, and critiqued perceived bias in divorce court, often making sexist comments. Nikki Sterling's brief return led to an uncomfortable exchange about a "lesbian couch" and sexually suggestive remarks. Callers shared personal divorce stories, often detailing financial hardships and perceived injustices. A significant portion involved playing audio recordings of Georgia executions, focusing on the contrast between the emotionless delivery and the gravity of the event, including an instance where the execution went wrong.  Sponsors—a restaurant, Vermont Teddy Bears, and Optimum Online—were promoted with humorous commentary, particularly an anecdote about a poorly-edited Vermont Teddy Bears advertisement.

The broadcast concluded with a comedic bit simulating a botched execution. This transitioned into further listener calls and discussions, including details on the whipped cream bikini contest, with several contestants visiting the studio.  The Mets game and Mike and the Mad Dog were also discussed, along with callers sharing humorous and vulgar anecdotes of their day.  Multiple female guests appeared, participating in the contest, and their appearances and photos for WNAW.com were discussed.  The show ended with promotional information about the bikini contest and upcoming website content, maintaining its irreverent and sexually suggestive tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  They act like a-hole braggers.  We are the best.  1027.  Opie, don't cry on me.  WNEW.  What a day, what a day, what a day.  Another record-breaking heat wave.  I took six walks today.  Six walks.  I just kept finding excuses to go out on the streets of New York today. 
[00:00:30]  Unbelievable.  Hot.  Nice.  I see all you guys in your business suits and your shades.  You're not fooling anyone.  Ben and I were laughing our balls off.  When you're checking out girls and skimpy little tops and stuff,  you've got to be a little discreet.  These guys are just like...  Twice?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  We never got out of coffee.  No, we did.  And we had fun getting it.  212-757-1027.  Very, very busy show.  That's why we want to get right into it today.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Thanks for checking us out.  We appreciate that.  You know that.  Kristen, real fast, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I'm going to come down tomorrow for your whipped cream bikini contest.  Well, tomorrow's the last day to qualify.  So, ladies, what are you waiting for?  You either come down today or tomorrow to show off what you got.  Well, I'm coming down tomorrow.  I have class tonight.  How old are you?  Class.  Class.  Yeah, how old are you?  20.  Oh, okay.  And where are you from?  I'm from the Hudson Valley, Newburgh.  Right on.  We look forward to seeing you tomorrow. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah?  So, can you tell me what street you're on?  Yeah.  They'll take care of that off air, okay?  Okay.  All right.  There goes Kristen.  She's coming down tomorrow.  And, you know, I will not accept the emails from the listeners that this contest sucks anymore.  I know.  You know, there's like 30 girls up on www.com and a lot of people are saying, man, what a  waste of time checking out the pictures.  Well, one girl was worth checking out, you know, as a qualification for the contest that  the girls have to be ugly.  I'd love to see what this guy's, like, going out with. 
[00:02:00]  You guys are insane.  What is this guy hooking up with on a weekend where he looks at the website, looks at some  of these girls on there and goes, oh, oh, none of them are worth it.  Oh, I'd love to see the friggin' war pigs this guy comes home with.  Give me a break.  There are some hot girls.  All right.  Granted, there are a few girls sprinkled in there that might be a specialty case.  You know what I mean?  We call it the riffraff.  Right.  You get rid of the riffraff and we have all the finalists up starting Monday for you guys 
[00:02:30]  to vote on, you're going to be pretty damn impressed.  We take everybody.  Any girl that wants to come up and participate in this can come up and do it.  We don't turn them away at the door.  So, yeah, a couple of them.  You might get some that don't appeal to as many people as some of the others would, Opie,  if I could be diplomatic.  Did you check out the pictures from the two girls that were here yesterday?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Very nice.  I'm going to go on record and say I think both those girls are going to be finalists for  that trip to Hawaii. 
[00:03:00]  Absolutely.  Trip to Hawaii, ladies.  Yeah.  Today and tomorrow.  And that's it as far as qualifying goes.  We've got to end this contest eventually.  All right.  So get your asses down here.  We look forward to seeing you.  Also getting some emails from girls saying, well, I really want to come down, but I'm  a little nervous about being naked and this and that.  We take care of all that.  Swear to God.  Some girls, they don't care and they'll walk around the whole place completely naked for  everyone to check out.  Others, very, very shy.  They want to put the whipped cream on in the bathroom and stuff like that.  That's all fine.  Fine and dandy.  Some girls just want a little dollop on their little naughty area. 
[00:03:30]  Some want full bikinis, like old-fashioned 50s bikinis.  Right.  It's all good.  All right.  That's right.  And if you want, as they call in the business, a closed set, no people gawking at you while  you're getting your pictures taken, we do that, too.  You could do that.  So don't worry.  Just come down.  Trip to Hawaii on the line.  I think you can talk to any of the ladies that have come down thus far and they're very  happy how it all was handled.  I think they've all had fun.  All right.  We just want to make sure we give every girl an opportunity to win that trip to Hawaii, Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Steve, what's up?  Opie, man, you know all guys love to gawk at girls.  Nobody's ruining anything, man.  Steve.  And listen, by the way, I think your website's great, man.  Screw all those guys that think it's crap.  No, Steve, the point I was making, these guys were gawking so bad that we had some fine  sites to check out ourselves, but we were behind the guys and they were ruining it,  right?  You're ruining it.  Well, you're not first in line.  You lose, man.  I understand.  Talk to you guys later.  I understand the guy's gawk.  It's like trying to hail the cab, you know?  You see the guy up the street, it's like, oh, he's going to nail it and I'm going to miss 
[00:04:30]  out.  So if the guy does something, then the girls are like, oh, and then they're on guard for  it.  And whoever came up with that fashion where the girls wear like the little spaghetti  strap tops, they should get a medal.  They like those, yeah.  It's amazing.  And it's in season for like the third or fourth year in a row.  Very nice.  Really nice.  Little spaghetti strings.  Still trying to figure out how they keep their, I just want to be nice to the ladies,  how they keep their boobs up and nice because you see the little spaghetti straps and you're 
[00:05:00]  like, there's no way there could be a bra under there.  Well, I think the girls that are wearing them have nice, firm boobs.  You know what I mean?  Most.  Most.  All right.  But I don't think they'd be supporting.  I saw one girl, I saw one girl, she looked like a gunslinger today.  Oh.  There were a couple of pistolas by her hips.  They were down near her sides there.  Oh.  But that's okay.  Yeah.  We love them all.  That's right.  The ladies get mad at us.  I know.  You know, you can't, you can't speak the truth without someone getting pissed off. 
[00:05:30]  Someone will get mad no matter what we say.  The NOW organization, they'll start writing their letters again.  You know, you know, women aren't sex objects, this and that, blah, blah, blah.  Whatever.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, you know what, women, uh, well, to, to men, you are a sex object.  Mm-hmm.  I'm not saying you're not more, you know?  It's like, you're not only sex objects, but we're looking.  And if the people from NOW think that, uh, that's ever gonna go away, they're on drugs. 
[00:06:00]  We love to gawk.  Can't take the animal out of us.  Right.  That would all be good.  Back in the old days, you'd creep up from behind, give a quick sniff.  Before you know it, you're dragging her away by her hair.  Right.  Back to the cave.  Back to the mansion.  And that's, that's still deep inside every single one of us.  Of course it is.  We're still animals.  Yeah, without the club.  You don't bash them over there with the club, Rick.  Club and F.  Club and F.  Club and F.  Dragged by the hair. 
[00:06:30]  Wow.  It was probably more brutal than that.  Yeah, I don't, yeah.  Uh, Brian.  Brian, looks fun on the Flintstones.  Reality of it?  It was a daily, yeah, like dating Mike Tyson every night.  There you go.  Come here, bitch.  I'm gonna pull you by the hair, and then I'm gonna carry you like a bowling ball back to my cage.  Where you just might get out alive.  Uh, Brian?  Brian?  Hello?  I think he's gone.  Okay.  Getting a lot of reports that some, um, some fan of the show was on Jenny Jones today. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Uh, with huge boobs saying that she's, um, a huge supporter of Whip-Em-Out Wednesday,  and Jenny Jones was talking about this, uh, little Whip-Em-Out Wednesday thing that happens in New York.  Mm-hmm.  We're trying to confirm if that went down.  We don't know for sure.  No doubt it.  It's in New York, so.  A lot of fans.  A lot of fans of the show.  And we'll get this out of the way right off the bat, too, because I heard about this, and this is true.  Sean, what's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Listen, uh, top of the ninth, last night's Met game on ESPN, this big, wow sign from the fans on the first phase side. 
[00:07:30]  Uh, it was on for about, I'd say, five seconds.  Yeah, we got a lot of email on that today.  Very cool.  As soon as the sign went up, my, uh, fiance, she wowed me.  Yeah, if that guy brings in the sign, we'll give him something.  Maybe that's what, uh, maybe that's what distracted the Mets and had him lose that lead.  Jesus Christ.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, boom.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, boom.  You know what, you're not even going to get to me, because I don't even care about baseball until the Knicks are out, uh, either out of, uh, out of, uh, the series or win, win it all. 
[00:08:00]  Well, you better care if they're blowing leads like that.  I don't care.  Oh, my God, what a disaster that game was.  It's, it's me, that's it.  Mm-hmm.  We have just begun.  Yeah, bases loaded, no outs, they're going to get one run at them.  I got to worry about the Knicks.  Yeah.  I can't worry about the Mets, I got to worry about the Knicks, I got to pull them through this series, Anthony.  Yeah.  Right.  You, personally.  I'm one of those fans, though, I'm convinced.  What I say and do at home, you know, pulls them through a little bit.  Helps them out. 
[00:08:30]  Makes Candy play a little better.  Did you see the, uh, accident-prone Piazza last night?  When he went to grab that ball and he punched the bat.  He is, you know what?  Ow!  And then that throw to second.  What the hell was that?  He's throwing to the pitcher.  You know why I can't even argue the point with you?  He is a clutch.  Oh!  You have hit it on the head.  He's a mess.  More wacky things have happened to him than any other player in the history of the sport.  And then Peyton getting nailed was entertaining, too.  Well, we can talk about Knobloch if you want to get into it.  No, I understand. 
[00:09:00]  Believe me.  Knobloch getting just pummeled.  Things thrown at him.  Both teams having their problems.  I understand.  But, um, yeah, Peyton got nailed last night and, uh, he came flying toward the mound looking pissed.  Right.  And then the, uh, the catcher, uh, tried to grab him.  And he starts, like, throwing swings at him.  He can't punch a catcher's mask.  He's got to punch a mask.  And then they threw the pitcher out.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, speaking of baseball, do you have something to tell us?  Swear to God. 
[00:09:30]  Um, Ben said that we got in trouble for something.  Yeah, management just informed me we cannot play that clip of, uh, broadcaster, Mets broadcaster, Bob Murphy, any longer.  You know that clip where it's, like, going back deep, back, back, and he's to the wall.  It's a home run.  Was it a home run or he got it?  Uh, home run.  Home run.  Oh, wait, he caught it?  Oh, wait, he got it?  Oh, it looked like it was a home run.  Why can't we?  You know that clip.  We can't play it anymore.  Why can't we play that anymore?  Well, because another station in town that is... 
[00:10:00]  No, it's the fan.  Yep.  We're supposed to be one big happy family.  What is their problem with us playing that clip?  That's their property.  Oh, God.  It's their property.  Their property.  Yep.  What a bunch of pussies.  They're whining and they're crying over a little 20-second clip.  Well, Maggie, you know, it's our clips.  It's our clips of Obie and Anthony have beaten us and evading.  And how the hell are we going to sit around when they're playing some of the best clips 
[00:10:30]  from our station?  Yeah, you want to play Obie and Anthony?  I can play the same game.  Maggie, I'm going to start using some of those lines.  Some of them recordings.  We're on the bars.  We don't give a crap.  Maggie, don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  There you go.  How do you like that?  I can play the same game.  Alabama, man.  Don't play with me.  How are you?  You son of a bitch.  Ha, ha.  You have a girl, Maggie. 
[00:11:00]  Pull the string.  Pull the string.  Oh.  You want to play?  I can play.  Ouch.  So, Maggie, you have a bit soon.  Check out the cat.  Happy to be here.  Well, Maggie, that's something you don't see in a toilet every day.  Can we see your stuff? 
[00:11:30]  Maggie, you're a kid, Patrick.  Torture is torture.  Maggie, cancel all appointments.  You know, Maggie, when you're telling these little stories, I have a point.  It's so much interesting, but is this stuff legal?  This is legal, isn't it?  Dylan!  Hold on, hold on. 
[00:12:00]  Well, that's a winner.  Maggie.  You know, we don't have to put up with this.  They're going to play that.  They're going to get better ratings playing clips from Alonso.  How about this?  The big yellow is the sun.  The big yellow is the sun, Maggie.  I got it from an igra.  Nigga, please.  Hey, bugger, bugger, hello.  I'm over here now.  Maggie, what's right?  What's right?  Medium well done.  Uh-uh.  Yeah, Maggie.  Stick it in my mouth. 
[00:12:30]  God, how scared are they if they're calling our boss over one stupid little clip we play?  One clip that we have played.  That's it.  We play one clip because we enjoy it.  Enjoy the Bob Murphy.  A lot of fun to listen to.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know, Maggie.  I think you're a clumpet buncher.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  All right.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah, okay.  Terrific.  Hello?  Hey, Carolyn. 
[00:13:00]  What's up?  Hey.  Well, I was going to say something else, but first, what about that whole, like, any rebroadcast  without the express written consent of Major League Baseball, strictly prohibited?  Ah, poof-ha.  Well, the problem is we're kind of, we're owned by the same company, and the company's trying  to convince Anthony and I that we're all one big happy family.  Yeah.  When it's convenient for them.  When it's convenient for them, right.  Right.  But then when we play one clip from a Met game, that's, you know, a problem.  I don't know how they expect us to compete here at WNAW, because, like, we own the fans, 
[00:13:30]  so they don't really want us going down the sports road.  Right.  God forbid that we talk about sports, you know, we're two, you know, guys that like  sports.  Yeah.  So we could, they get all, you know, pissy when we do that.  And then we also own K-Rock, so when we start, you know, talking about music and playing  some of the songs we like, there's a problem with that as well.  Yeah.  So all that leaves you with sex, but then they don't let you do that really either.  Right.  To the right extent, so yeah.  We're like the bastard stepchild of this company.  They don't want us to succeed.  Maggie Dan from Hoboken checking in on instant feedback. 
[00:14:00]  Get in the coffin.  So what were you going to say?  Oh, I was going to offer some insight, full disclosure on the whole spaghetti strap outfit.  Okay.  You have a couple of choices.  You have the strapless bra.  Ah, the strapless bra.  A miracle of this century.  Is it kind of like two-top-ish?  Yes.  I got a bone, you're stank.  And they also have the strapless lifting bras as well. 
[00:14:30]  They're many and very...  Oh, I see the lifting bras.  Okay, sure.  There's a lot of wire with those, right?  Right.  And then there's also a thing, I think it's fairly new, maybe just like last year or this  year, the spaghetti strap taps with the built-in bras.  Ah, nice.  I didn't know that one.  Yeah.  Well, you see, you got to shop at Express or something every once in a while.  You find out these things.  All right, Carolyn.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Or is it Caroline?  It's Caroline.  It's Caroline, Brian.  It's Caroline.  Brian Vigan checking in. 
[00:15:00]  Doesn't like me using it.  I love the double impressions, by the way.  Keep them up.  They're really good.  What's the double impressions?  Well, like, you know, Anthony doing, dog doing, Brian Regan.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thank you, Caroline.  Can I ask you something?  What are we going to do about this?  What are we going to do about this, Caroline?  Well, can I ask you something as long as we're going on full disclosure?  Yeah.  At what age, generally, is it that the unwanted or unexpected erection happens? 
[00:15:30]  What?  Let's see.  Oh, hey.  That's how we can help with these questions.  Okay, all right.  Why do you ask?  I'm just sort of curious, just like, you know, maybe you were curious about the built-in thing  in the wrong.  There's got to be a reason you're asking this.  Yeah.  What is the reason?  Well, I figured that...  You're talking unexpected, like, guy not thinking about sex, nothing to stimulate him at all  in the area, and it just goes, right?  Right.  Oh, my God. 
[00:16:00]  That ends in the teen years.  No.  You were getting them after 20?  Get them now.  Yeah.  See, unexpected, just out of nowhere?  Yes.  Out of nowhere, it's just like, bump.  There.  So, obviously, it varies from guy to guy.  Why?  Maybe it's a testosterone-level thing, or...  You got a boyfriend?  A husband?  Yeah, a boyfriend, yeah.  And all of a sudden, he just gets these things out of nowhere?  No, no.  I was just wondering when it stopped happening.  And, you know... 
[00:16:30]  Wow, I just learned something.  It's easier to ask anonymously.  There definitely has to be stimuli around.  I don't get just the...  Some kind of stimuli?  Not necessarily.  We're talking, like, you're watching, I don't know, Murder, She Wrote, something that just  will not...  It's not a turn-on.  All of a sudden, it just happens.  Well, I don't watch Murder, She Wrote.  Well, you know what I mean.  But you're in a situation where there's...  You're not thinking about sex.  There's no stimuli around, and it happens?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't...  I don't know how that happened. 
[00:17:00]  It's just like...  Mom.  Yeah.  It's there.  Well, these guys say it happens to this day, so...  Yeah.  I guess it all depends.  Why?  Is your boyfriend not getting any?  Oh, no, no.  There's no problem there.  I just...  All right.  I heard that it was full disclosure.  I was, you know, asking a question that I sort of wanted the answer to.  Here's a guy.  We respect Uncle John's answer.  Uncle John?  Well, thank you.  Since I'm an expert, I'm 46 years old.  It's still happening.  Still happening at 40 years?  Still happening.  Yeah, it doesn't stop, guys.  Interesting. 
[00:17:30]  Yep.  We're talking unexpected.  Yeah.  Just out of nowhere, like, wow, why does that happen?  And not just...  Just driving down...  There it is.  All right.  Not just morning wood.  Now I see old Faith, and he's kind of concerning...  Yeah, right.  No, I still...  Well, I don't have many problems, but I don't get the unexpected.  Just driving down the road, nothing happens.  Wow.  Okay.  Thanks, Uncle John.  Take care, guys.  I'm definitely in a minority, because the phones are going nuts.  Everyone's saying that it still happens.  Well, glad to stimulate open discussion.  Eric on line 1143. 
[00:18:00]  It happens while watching MSNBC, and I don't know why.  Yeah.  All right, Carolyn.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm giving guys boners.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  MSNBC.  I'm as in the morning giving men boners.  I'll help the fan today.  I'll give them a little programming tip today, okay?  All right.  Because they're all pissed off at us because we're playing one stupid clip.  They actually called their bosses over one stupid clip.  3.30 boner time, baby. 
[00:18:30]  That's insane.  One clip.  Not even of, you know, a show over there.  If you want to try to compete with the Open Anthony show, this is free.  You don't even have to pay me for this.  All right.  Don't spend 36 to 48 straight hours talking about the new Billy Crystal movie, 61.  Fabulous.  Great movie, Billy Crystal.  They pound things into the ground and then wonder why they can't compete with us.  I wish I could say lots of matters. 
[00:19:00]  We don't have to stay on these subjects for days on end.  Is that what they were doing with the, um...  They do it with everything.  Yeah.  But that's the latest one.  Yeah.  There.  Free programming tip from your pal, the Opster.  There you go.  Douchebag.  Take it and use it.  Run with it, if you will.  Yeah.  Anthony, speaking of underwear and all that fun stuff...  Uh-huh.  Time Out New York is...  The new issue's out.  They're not even advertising with us anymore.  I don't even care because I love this because this guy in the back writes the Get Naked column. 
[00:19:30]  Get Naked.  Jamie Bufalino.  And he has a really good letter from a wife that's very concerned because her husband cross-dresses  and wants breast implants.  But still, a husband and...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into the letter next.  It's not that I'm gay.  We'll get into the letter next, okay?  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  David Duke doing stand-up with the Apollo.  We'll get more left.  Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:00]  AnthonyProFlowers.com.  Jesus Christ.  I just ran it.  I'm running back and forth in production trying to do...  Steve better be getting every second of this on tape.  More outtakes from Anthony trying to do Strauss Discount Auto...  Yes, it is.  ...tags.  Strauss Discount Auto tags.  And I don't know what it is with them.

Steve from FoundryMusic.com just walked in the studio.  He looks like a beaten man.  What the hell have you done to him in that other studio? 
[00:21:00]  It's Strauss.  Funny, because it happens every time.  Every time!  Now, Steve, how many other things do I go in and blow out now, and then I get done in seconds?  None.  None.  None.  Not a goddamn one.  You're right.  But the Strauss ones take even longer.  I don't know what it is about putting you in a studio without, oh, for anybody else and a piece of copy.  You cannot get through it.  It's hard for anyone, though.  You're right, though.  And the Strauss ones are the worst.  Yes, they really are.  They're things with dural lube, dyna system, flowy, lyle, granny, fluid things. 
[00:21:30]  How many takes is he up to?  He's not even on the second one yet.  I got through the first one.  You're taping all this, right?  Yeah, of course.  And Drew Boogie's in there sitting down because they're working on something, and he's watching,  and I just look at his face like, oh, my God, it's real.  They're like, this really happened.  Drew's stunned.  He can't do it.  Drew's looking at this going, are you taping this?  You're taping this, right?  Yeah, a lot of times people think we make crap up, but no.  Oh, no.  Hey, where's my Dragnet clip? 
[00:22:00]  It's in the basket.  Is it?  Oh, cool.  You had a great Dragnet clip, Ant.  I gave it to you like hours ago.  I think.  It's from Joe Friday.  He rules.  Is he talking about drugs?  Marijuana.  Oh, great.  When he talks about drugs, listen to this one.  Little Joe Friday.  Marijuana is an archite, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good, and does everybody a lot of harm.  Dad, dad, dad, go up yourself.  That does everybody a lot of harm.  You'll be hearing that one a million times.

[00:23:00]  Saturdays, 11 to 3.  1027-WNEW.  Now that rocks.  That's a band called Nine Points Anthony.  Yes.  What a day.  On 1027-WNEW.  It's the ONA show.  I struggle through the Strauss Discount Auto Tags.  Oh, yeah, now Steve's got to clean it up for the radio. 
[00:23:30]  I wasn't that bad.  I didn't really curse that much.  Although Rick was trying to screw me up.  I do it on my own.  See, I'm trying to do the tag.  He walks behind the console that I'm standing in front of, and he's got the big balloon schlong in his pants.  But I can do it myself, I screw up.  No distractions necessary.  Balloon schlong.  All right, now there's a doctor in the line that's going to make me really paranoid. 
[00:24:00]  Uh-oh.  Jason, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing, Opie?  All right.  I'm not a doctor.  I'm pre-med.  Yeah, I play one on TV.  But do you have a feeling like you need to constantly urinate?  Um, no, not really.  Okay.  Why?  When he drinks a lot of wine.  You might want to have a prostate exam or a urinary tract exam.  Why?  How old are you, 35?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's nothing uncommon about getting it.  Wait, just because I don't get the spontaneous wood.  Yeah.  I think it's more unnatural that you don't. 
[00:24:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah, I was kind of surprised when all you guys said, yeah, it still happens.  Well, maybe you're just a fact.  This is big Christmas abroad.  All right.  You got me, though.  Gil, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  So check this out.  The other day, you know, I work at Roosevelt Field, Chabot Center.  I don't know if I should say what store I work at, but Kimmy walks in.  Say it.  Oh, man.  Get a plug for your place, man.  What?  Say the place. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Eddie Bauer.  All right?  I work at Eddie Bauer at Roosevelt Field, right?  I'm an associate there.  Yeah.  So she walks in.  I'm in the women's section.  Eddie Poner.  Eddie Poner.  Yeah, right?  Oh, my God.  It was ridiculous.  She comes in.  She's wearing no bra.  And I'm, like, dying here, right?  And she comes in with this, like, boyfriend of hers.  I don't know.  She's like, he's like, fat bastard.  I don't know what he was, you know?  So she comes and she goes, you got to pick out an outfit for me.  I'm like, for what?  She refuses to count me.  Even though I know who she is, like, I was playing with her.  I'm like, you know, what am I picking out for? 
[00:25:30]  She's like, oh, you got to pick out an outfit for me.  You got to pick out.  I'm like, what?  She's like, she's like, no, just, I do get to pick out an outfit.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Point.  All right.  Pointing.  You're telling us about a chick shopping.  Oh, we're captivated.  All right.  All right.  We're merciful crap.  You know what?  I should have just read what you had on the screen.  Kimmy bought her final survivor outfit at my store. 
[00:26:00]  She looks so effing hot.  Look how quick that was.  That's unbelievable.  That's unbelievable.  All right.  Thank you, Gil.  All right.  No problem.  Bye.  And Kimmy is going to try to plug the show tonight in front of, like, 50 million people.  If she does this, she is the hero of this program.  It'll beat out the Jay Moore plug for best plug ever for the show.  Hell, yeah.  You kidding?  But I don't know.  That's a huge audience.  You know what, though?  I don't think the Jay Moore plug was the best plug ever for this radio show.  Best plug ever.  I think it's Susie's boobs on the Today Show. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then again, our names were never mentioned in that one.  Just wow.  But Jay Moore, you know, over the last station.  Right.  Which, of course, you put wow and stupid radio promotion together.  That's pretty much all.  Yeah.  Who else could that possibly be?  All right.  You want me to read this letter?  Yeah.  What is this about?  Well, time out in New York.  I mean, there's a guy that he's kind of like a sexpert.  His name's Jamie Bufolino.  And he's like, you know, Dear Abby for, like, you know, for sex and stuff. 
[00:27:00]  Mm-hmm.  And these letters are hilarious.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  They never fail.  There's always something a little strange in here.  A little twisted.  Well, it is New York.  All right.  Well, let me read the letter here.  Okay.  All I'm looking at is the back of the magazine.  Yeah.  The side that's facing me.  Men seeking men.  Oh, the hookup.  Women seeking women.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I didn't even see the picture of the hookup.  That's what I mean.  The hookup.  They're kind of like slow dancing or something.  I don't know.  Oh. 
[00:27:30]  How's that for a popper?  Oh, ho.  The gay guys?  How's that for a popper?  Oh, ho.  The gay guys slow dance?  Do they slow dance?  Yeah.  I don't know, Opie.  It's something I never thought of before.  Rick, do they?  In Philadelphia, the movie with Tom Hanks and Venter Washington, they did.  Philadelphia, the movie?  Yeah.  They slow dance?  When you're off mic, Rick, you're supposed to go, yeah!  It's Philadelphia, man.  Yeah!  That's how it's done.  Listen to pros. 
[00:28:00]  Listen to what?  I want to go off on a tangent about radio because we're the only radio show that puts everyone's  mic up at the same level.  Yeah, I know.  There's no egos in this studio.  There are so many shows that, like, make believe, because I don't want to get trashed here,  make believe I'm the host of the show.  Your mic would be here, Ed.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, it's great.  It would just be a little lower.  So what's the story about?  What?  So what's the story about?  Yeah! 
[00:28:30]  Oh, boy.  Anyway, okay, here's the letter.  You're great, baby.  I've been married for 24 years.  24 years.  This is a lady, okay?  Her name Haywood Jablomi, right?  No.  No?  Oh, I got confused.  Um, now I got to wait in case he dumped out of that.  No.  All right, I've been married for 24 years.  We have a son who is 22 years old and a daughter who is 19.  My husband is a cross-dresser.  Okay, I'm never going to get to this letter.  Hold on. 
[00:29:00]  Gay Marco.  Hey!  I love to slow dance.  Oh, my God.  You love slow dancing.  It's so romantic.  Whenever I get a date over to my pad, I always put on, like, Ella Fitzgerald and we'll, like,  slow dance.  Ella Fitzgerald and you slow dance.  Oh, it's so romantic.  You're such a fan.  So, like, gay guys slow dance, huh?  Of course.  Doesn't that take away from valuable just AF-ing time?  You've got to have a little foreplay. 
[00:29:30]  A little foreplay.  So it's a little dancing, maybe.  What kind of slow dancing do you do, Marco?  A little, uh, a little of that dirty dancing?  What do you do?  No, you know, you put, like, I put my hands around his neck and he'll put his hands on  my hip and I, like, sway back and forth and...  Tango across the floor, but instead of a rose in his mouth, he's got, like, man junk.  Yeah, right to the bedroom.  But it's always hard because you never know who's leading.  So you're into that slow dance thing.  I love slow dancing.  I love that.  And I love that column in Time Out New York. 
[00:30:00]  That guy is so funny.  Well, he talks about penis pumps in the other letter.  Oh, God.  I can't wait to read it.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Bye-bye, Marco.  There goes Marco.  Hello.  Hey, guys, like to slow down.  See, we learn stuff.  It's a winner.  Hey.  All right.  All right, back to the letter.  All right, I've been married for 24 years.  We have a son.  He's 22.  A daughter who's 19.  My husband is a cross-dresser.  He told me this about three years into our marriage.  And they've been married 27 years. 
[00:30:30]  24.  24.  Okay.  That's the first problem with this letter.  He told me this about three years into our marriage.  That's why I completely believe people should sleep together and live together before marriage.  Yeah.  So there's no effing surprises when you finally get married.  Three years into it, he tells her.  Yeah, well, that's...  Because she's already committed.  That could be something we could get into today.  Mm-hmm.  What did you find out about your partner after, you know, you got married and made an official?  Oh, my God.  And now you can't get out of the relationship because it'll...  Of course, it's a simple process that causes no anger or anything. 
[00:31:00]  Right now, as we speak, some of my life is being judged.  I couldn't even be at my own goddamn, like, pre-trial.  Like you wanted to be there.  Not really.  You wanted to be in a good mood today, right?  We have to push it off till 3 o'clock.  Fat seat.  All right.  Your letter, I'll be...  Wow.  I was just saying, like, people should, you know, live together and stuff before they 
[00:31:30]  get married so you can learn as much as you possibly can about your significant other  before it's too late.  Right.  Right.  Good idea.  Because how they set up marriage, sometimes it is too late.  You cannot get the divorce.  It's easier just to stay married and deal with this crap.  Right.  That's what I'm thinking.  Hopefully someone will back me up on this when they tell us what they found out about  their significant other after they got married.  If you want less pain, like, if you want to go through the divorce because you want to  end some of the suffering you had in the marriage, the marriage better have been she's tapping 
[00:32:00]  your sack with a ball-peen hammer on a nightly basis because the divorce is equally as frustrating  and painful.  Painful.  We're going to have a great show today.  Uh-huh.  Today.  And later on after this, we'll talk about Rod Stewart's take on marriage.  Okay.  That's in the paper.  That's good.  Yeah.  All right.  So, yeah, my husband's a cross-dresser.  He told me this about three years into our marriage and I totally freaked out.  Here's a lady.  She already invested three years. 
[00:32:30]  Probably the first kid already on the way, Anthony.  Yeah.  I thought he was gay or would want a sex change.  I settled down after we went to a support group of cross-dressers and their families.  Oh.  Imagine what that seems like.  Imagine this poor woman married to this guy and now she's got to be dragged to these cross-dresser  meetings where, you know, hi, my name is Bob.  I like to be in a dress.  Just sitting around in the dresses and, you know, because most of these cross-dressing guys,  you remember that girl, uh, that guy-girl, Tula, it was? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Tula.  The Bond girl.  Yeah, the Bond girl.  The Bond girl.  They didn't even know.  Yeah, Bond girl, yeah.  They didn't even know that Tula was a guy, used to be a guy, because Tula looked like  a chick.  And, you know what?  Everyone was fooled.  Yeah.  Because she was one of, like you said, one of the Bond girls.  99.9% of the guys that cross-dress do not look like Tula.  They look like, no, that was more than a cross-dress, though.  Yeah, that was sex change.  She went the distance with the hormones and everything.  But for a while, uh, before the sex change, this guy had to go around like a woman. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  Yeah.  And, and from the pictures I saw, pulling it off pretty well.  Most of the guys, no.  You watch those HBO specials on cross-dresses and stuff?  It's, it's Hank the Plumber or something, or Artie the Carpenter, decided to put on a,  a snappy little number.  It's still with the whiskers and everything.  Ah.  All right.  Disgusting.  All right, so they went to this, uh, uh, support group.  Uh, here's something else I'll, I'll, I'll tell everyone today. 
[00:34:00]  I don't believe in support groups.  That's, wait, let me recover from that.  You scared me.  Here's something else I want to tell everyone.  I've been to the cross-dress.  No, no, no, no.  That's what I was expecting.  It's what, you don't believe in the support group.  Nah.  No, I know.  It's a waste of time.  Counseling.  All that crap is a waste of time.  If you're not happy in a marriage and you think counseling or support group's going to help you,  out.  Count your losses and just move on.  Leave.  That's a pretty, uh, intense statement, but I completely believe that.  Absolutely.  You think counseling is going to help if you just can't stand the person you're being with 
[00:34:30]  or something?  It ain't going to work.  All right, so they went to the, uh, support group.  All right, I still have a hard time dealing with this, but my husband and I both agree  that he would contain his activity so our children would not be exposed to it.  Is this Donna Hanover writing this letter?  The ex-Mrs. Mayor Giuliani?  No.  No?  I'm a little confused.  I was guessing.  I guess, though.  I allowed him to wear panties all the time.  Yeah.  And when our daughter went to college, he started wearing nightgowns to bed. 
[00:35:00]  Now my husband wants...  Hold on to your seats, please.  All right, let me strap in.  Now my husband wants breast implants.  He was a hoo-er.  No, he was a hoo-er.  Now he wants the breast implants.  Breast implants.  It gets better.  He's done a lot of research on this, and amazingly, there are plenty of plastic surgeons  who are totally willing to perform this procedure on men.  My husband assures me that this is the extent of his interest to alter his body.  He does not want a sex change.  He wants double D cup boobs. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, who doesn't?  Not on you.  Well, if you're going to get the...  That way.  If you're going to get the breast implants, you might as well go to the distance.  Go for the big ones.  He wants the double D cup boobs, and he wants to wear a bra and panties the rest of his  life and sleep in women's sleepwear.  He said he will continue to restrict his dress-up activities to times when I'm not around.  My questions are, do you think a boob job will be enough to keep him happy?  No.  I'm scared that this will be just the beginning, and how will we tell our kids? 
[00:36:00]  Imagine you're the kid.  You're his son.  Hey, Dad, nice tease.  Nice rack, Pop.  Can I cop a feel?  Hey, Dad, I was thinking of going to the...  I don't know, maybe me and you will go catch the game or something, but can I T.F. you?  Pop, come on.  Let me just T.F. you, and we'll go to the game.  You know how we're talking about counseling and support groups?  Fred, go ahead real fast.  Hey, guys.  Hey. 
[00:36:30]  I was smoking a lot of pot when I was 13 and 14 years old, and I got sent to a day program.  Yeah, yeah.  Within a month, I came out doing blow and dope.  And everybody was telling me how good blow was and how good dope was, and they were complaining and making it sound so good.  I went and smoked a pot.  I came out doing heroin and then blow.  Nice.  Remember that?  Great support group.  Great support group.  All right, Fred.  Thank you.  You know that rehab place out there in the Hop Hog, I think it is, right up 347, and it's the Apple House.  I swear to God, we used to drive by there, and there'd be like these hot coke whore chicks right out in front. 
[00:37:00]  And we never had the balls to do it, but I always used to think, what an easy date.  You pull up, roll that window down, pull out a bag, and just go, hey, sweetie, come here.  She's going to run for your schlong so fast.  You know what?  I can do you one better.  Where do the sex addict people meet?  Oh, yeah.  Zip.  Zip.  Zip.  Don't even need a date. 
[00:37:30]  Hey, baby.  Right in the parking lot.  They're leaving the church.  It's a dope thing, though, man.  We used to always pass by, and they'd be like, because they used to do these fundraisers, like car washes and stuff.  Yeah.  So you'd pull your car in just to see, because they're in these little tank tops or something.  It's a freaking car wash.  I love that.  Yeah, they do the car wash.  I would drive by, and they'd be like, why are drug addicts washing cars?  Well, they were.  And I tell you what, I used to pull in to get my car washed. 
[00:38:00]  And I'd sit there and go, you know, one eight ball, and I'm getting F'd.  Because this chick here looks like he's Jonesy.  Isn't that always funny, too, speaking quickly with the car wash thing?  You ever pass by the high schools when they're doing that?  Oh, yeah.  How do you resist?  I don't care if they're using pudding to wash my truck.  You've got to pull in.  You've got to pull in.  Look at this.  Where were we? 
[00:38:30]  She's afraid that he's going to go further.  Yeah, pretty much.  Um, so, uh, Jamie, uh, Bufalino from, uh, Time Out says, so clearly you must love him enough and be getting enough in return out of the relationship to be able to survive this, uh, curveball he's throwing you.  Then again, you didn't exactly sign up for this marriage with the expectation that one day your flat-chested, fruit-of-the-loom-wearing hubby would end up with a nicer set of jugs and lingerie than you have.  Frankly, I'd be a little ticked off about the prenuptial false advertising. 
[00:39:00]  Plus, uh, although the two of you were able to negotiate a satisfying compromise on the cross-dressing front, you let him nick your knickers as long as he kept Victoria's, uh, secret a secret.  Now that your hubby wants to full-on pitch camp in Hooterville, there's much more than just his private happiness at stake here.  It's not like your friends and neighbors are going to be all, uh, live and let live when they get a load of their middle-aged pals' newly sprouted knockers in a country club locker room.  Really?  Hey, Bob, want to do 18 today? 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Can I TF you?  Right.  And just think of the havoc those babies are going to wreak on his golf swing.  The truth is, you guys are going to confront a whole lot of racophobia, for lack of a better word, which is going to affect the whole family.  So, and it just goes on from there.  Is that who wrote this letter?  Wait a minute.  Huh.  Mrs. Ken Stevens.  No?  It wasn't Ken Stevens?  No.  Notice the new little sachet in his wand.  And this guy's suggesting that the wife, the wife, uh, tells the husband, uh, to maybe, you know, um, convince him to test drive a nice pair of removable falsies before he goes through with the breast implant. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, nothing's like the real thing.  Have him try the whole bras and panties routine before committing to it surgically and see if that satisfies his, uh, his, can't say that word, his breast jones, let's say.  If so, he can privately play dress up to his heart content and not have to put your family through a public ordeal.  And it just goes on and blah, blah, blah.  Hmm. 
[00:40:30]  So if you have the implants, do you let your pals cop a feel?  Do you really let your friends just, you know, reach over and grab a handful of brand new double D?  I think as a goof, you gotta.  You gotta let your friends, hey, feel that nice, huh?  Nice.  Nice.  Which way?  As long as you know it's as a goof.  As a goof.  Well, yeah, okay.  Like if they're just juggling it a little bit and bouncing it around, it's one thing.  If you start slowly caressing a saliva-covered finger over your nip, there could be a problem. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  I'm getting it.  So there's a pretty good little letter in the latest issue of Time Out New York.  Wow.  That's twisted.  The poor kid.  You know, the woman's gotta be out of her mind anyway.  But the kids, you know, how do they deserve, oh yeah, my father's the guy with the cans.  You know what, how do you deal with, uh, your kids are away, you know, at college and you're watching, I don't know, the final episode of Survivor Tonight or something.  And your husband is sitting there with a bra and panties on. 
[00:41:30]  Bra and panties and going to bed in nightgowns.  Well, she obviously has a problem.  A little self-esteem problem.  Maybe she can't leave the relationship open.  Or he goes out to the sports bar with the guys and go catch the football game.  So you leave the house.  How do you go to work?  Imagine if this was your friend that you could save a lot of money that you would spend in the booby bars.  Have poker night and take care of, uh, just have your friend play poker topless.  Someone tells me he doesn't have those types of friends.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Ew.  I don't like those.  Uh, Dylan.  Hey guys, the first time call, a long time listener.  Thank you.  All right.  I was reading this article.  It's kind of along the lines of what you were reading about.  This guy, right?  Yeah.  He, like, um, talked his wife into putting a strap-on on and, like, them together, like,  doing this really gay act called a bridge.  Bridge?  Huh?  What's a bridge?  All right.  A bridge is, well, I got to clean this up, okay?  Yeah.  Let's say, okay, and this is two guys, right?  Guy one and guy two.  The guy one meets guy two's balloon knot, and guy two meets guy one's balloon knot at the same time. 
[00:42:30]  And one's on the top and one's on the top.  Hold on.  No matter how I try to picture this in my head, all the disgusting frames that are going by in my head,  I cannot figure that out.  Wait, say that again?  All right.  Balloon knot to balloon knot?  No, okay.  With what?  Why is Stinky nodding his head like he understands?  Yeah, Stinky, wait a minute.  I took the call.  I knew what he was talking about.  All right, clean it up for the radio and explain what Dylan just said.  You connect your rear ends with an apparatus. 
[00:43:00]  Oh.  All right.  He didn't say anything about an apparatus.  Good God.  I'm just thinking it looked like two kissing garamis in the fish tank.  You know?  I didn't know there was an apparatus.  One guy's on his back, one guy's on his stomach, and they just kind of back into each other.  Oh, God.  Well, but it was a chick with a strap on.  It was his wife.  Wait, chick.  Oh, oh, I want the strap on.  Oh, that's better.  Wait, chick.  It's not gay.  So.  Okay.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, no. 
[00:43:30]  Can you figure it out yet?  Yeah.  Chick.  So chick has the, yeah, okay.  They're butt to butt.  Yeah, exactly.  With a double.  A double-ended.  Yeah, double-edged.  There you go.  Wow.  Okay.  I'm sure glad now that horrific picture is in my head.  And it's called The Bridge?  Yeah.  All right.  The Bridge.  Maybe that's what Robert Plant was talking about in that song.  Thank you, Dylan.  Later, guys.  All right.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  And I thought we could digest everything we've learned so far today. 
[00:44:00]  Kevin from Connecticut.  And I thought the Gothels was a horrible bridge.  Hey, medical marijuana's here again?  Oh, man.  She's going to bore us with more marijuana rhetoric.  I thought it was kind of fun last time.  Stinky sister's here.  Medical marijuana Barbie.  Oh, and the girl that wanted the reshoot?  Yeah.  Yeah, but there's another really hot girl out there.  Who's that?  That's the guy that had the breast implants.  Well, last story, Ophie.  There's nothing wrong with it, Tim. 
[00:44:30]  Everything's good.  We've got a brand-new girl for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Ladies, you have until tomorrow to get your ass down here to qualify.  You still have, like, three hours to get down here today and, you know, during the show tomorrow, of course.  And then that's going to be it.  Then we've got to get our finalists and start voting for that trip to Hawaii.  All right?  We'll get into the Rod Stewart thing next?  Yeah, while we're on this subject.  And we'll move on.  Maybe we'll read the letter about penis pumps.  I don't enjoy it, Charles B. and Anthony on NEW. 
[00:45:00]  Stick your tongue in my starfish, you dirty little faggot whores.  Saturday night, starting at 7, WNEW gives you wheeze.  Hey, what's up, wheezer?  And cheese.  Veeze, my, my, my.  7 to 10, it's Brother Wee, endorsed by Opie and Anthony.  At 10, Eddie Strong cranks out the best variety of metal.  Nice, amazing.  And cheesy hair bands on Saturday night, for us, it's Wheeze.  Nice.  And cheese. 
[00:45:30]  1 to 3, 7, WNEW.  Wow, wow, wow.  I do believe we have a ringer for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Oh, really?  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  I can never see through that door.  Anthony, Planet Java, I want to start by bitching to the fine folks at Planet Java.  What now?  We need more Java-delic.  Java-delic.  You guys got me addicted to this stuff.  The least you can do is keep us well-socked.  Learned it from you, okay?  Okay, we got the tremble. 
[00:46:00]  I only use the tremble for special occasions.  Right, but the Java-delic, you drink it all day long.  Piece of cake, low-fat, little buzz, coffee, iced coffee drink, nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Which way?  Tremble, you know.  You got to be ready for the tremble.  Yeah, that's if you need it.  But the Java-delic tastes damn good.  Drink it all day.  We need more.  Send out the Planet Java signal so they know to bring more Planet Java to us. 
[00:46:30]  It's great.  Great tasting Planet Java out to kick the competition's butt.  So keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks.  The street patrols come into an area near you with cool new flavors.  Javadelic, tremble, and Karamoca.  Of course.  And tremble is the thing that gives you the big kick.  121 milligrams of caffeine.  And it's the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  So if you need a boost, I don't know, your trucker, mom, your boost for your workout,  whatever, tremble does the trick.  I almost just spit out.  What happened?  When Anthony from West Orange, going back to what we were just talking about. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  That's why I can't really tune out during the commercials anymore during our show.  Does the bridge close when there's a mudslide?  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  Oh.  Sorry.  Planet Java.  The wildest thing that hit the street.  Planet Java.  Ice coffee with an attitude available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet, ask them. 
[00:47:30]  Say, hey, get Planet Java in here.  Ice coffee just got cool.  Settle for nothing less.  Planet Java.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  Hey, we haven't had Ozzie call us in a while.  Ozzie Osborne.  Very big listener of the show.  If he's in New York listening today, call in and say hi. 
[00:48:00]  212-757-1027.  It's the O&A show.  We got a bunch of girls outside the studio showing up for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah.  Only two days left to qualify, ladies.  Today and tomorrow.  Trip to Hawaii.  Up for grabs.  You're crazy not to come down here.  We treat you with the utmost respect.  That is the truth.  All the girls leave having had a fun time.  That's right.  Anthony has an observation about the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah.  The first few days.  Yeah, I was just going through all the contestants on the NEW website. 
[00:48:30]  I started way back there.  Remember April 23rd when we first started with Demonia.  And then Madison and Cakes were on that first day.  We had three.  And the bikini's very big.  Very big.  I mean, Madison, who just loves being naked, she's got a lot of whipped cream on her.  You know what?  You've got to call Madison for privilege because her pictures don't do her justice.  Not at all.  She's so much hotter than that. 
[00:49:00]  She's got to come back.  I think she was freaked out.  And then she made a mistake that people do all the time.  They're getting their pictures taken.  She put her chin down like this.  Like that?  So it looks like she doesn't have a neck.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  I'm looking at her picture right now.  And the way it's taken, it looks like she's got no shape.  Right.  Like it's straight.  Yeah, no.  This girl is really hot.  You should call her and tell her to come back.  Tomorrow is the last day.  Reshoot.  Reshoot.  We have one girl here.  Stinky's sister is here for a reshoot. 
[00:49:30]  Yep.  And who's the other girl?  You call her what?  Say what you said off air.  Nikki Sterling?  Who's?  Who's hot?  She is hot, but you called her like an English bitch or something.  I did not!  Rick.  I never said that.  What'd you say then?  What'd you say?  I said she's got an English accent.  That's all I said.  Uh-oh, she just heard us outside. 
[00:50:00]  I never said that.  All right, bring her in.  Bring her in.  She's really hot.  Toby Dallas was the first girl, as I could see, that went with just three dollops of whipped cream.  Yeah, that's what you were getting at.  Basically, the bikini's getting smaller as the contest continues.  And all the girls after that have the little, little bikini on.  Hey, who are you?  Hello.  Hello.  Nikki Sterling.  Look at that.  There you go.  I like that.  That rocks.  You said it like we were supposed to know you.  Are we supposed to know you? 
[00:50:30]  It depends if you like watching porno movies.  Porno?  You're a porn star.  Well, look at that.  We love the pornos.  Nice.  What have you been in?  Yeah.  Oh, well, over 200 movies, so.  200 movies?  There's quite a few out there.  Really?  Yeah.  For the last six years, I guess, I've seen.  Give us a couple of titles that we might know.  Nikki Sterling's American Fan Club Prowl.  And they're your name.  Nick Gangbang.  You're doing a gangbang?  I have done a few gangbangs, yes.  What's the record that you have? 
[00:51:00]  I did one with, no, I didn't do any of those big ones.  I had a gangbang with 18 guys.  18?  And, yeah.  Wow.  The gangbang thing is like, you know, the fight game.  There's so many different titles out there.  You can't keep track.  I know.  You can't keep track of the gangbang titles.  Because some of these chicks are like 300 guys.  I can't see the pleasure in that, to be honest.  And they just, well, 18, you know.  Oh, that was fun.  That was fun?  Yeah, I couldn't walk for two days afterwards.  But it was fun.  He's running out of the studio.  He had to come in and look.  Because he goes, I got ten movies of hers. 
[00:51:30]  You got ten movies of Mickey?  Oh, girl.  Yeah.  Of course.  I knew exactly who she was when I was introduced to her.  You weren't in Slap Happy, were you?  No.  That's Steve's favorite of these days.  The Slap Happy.  The Slap Happy.  It's a guy.  It's all right.  It's a movie of these girls that like being smacked for some reason.  And they also, like, the guy will plunge his junk so far that the girls puke. 
[00:52:00]  They puke all over them.  But the girls love it.  They admit that they love it before they do the same.  It's a bit twisted.  And then this sick F brought it in.  It's a love story.  This guy, how many pornos do you have at home?  I'm starting to wonder about Steve from front of Disney.com.  Slap Happy put it over the top.  Before that, I'm like, hey, he's kind of a normal guy.  He's got a nice porno collection and stuff.  Then you felt like you know us well enough now that you've been here a while.  Like, hey, I'm going to break out some of the real stuff. 
[00:52:30]  And he brought a century sex, remember?  Right.  Yeah, century sex, the 100-year-old woman having sex.  How much?  Those big legal filing boxes?  Yeah.  Easily 12 of those.  Wow.  See, this is why I do these movies for men like that.  Right.  Yeah, but what I'm getting at is he's got some sick ass.  Oh, yeah.  Stuff he's not even going to admit he has yet.  No.  Until he's been working here another year.  Nice.  Not break. 
[00:53:00]  Jesus.  They don't exist.  Mm-hmm.  Just the ones I make.  See, we're idiots because everyone's like, oh, my God, I love Nicky's movies.  Hold on.  Let's get Scott on the air.  Big fan.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Nicky, good afternoon.  Hi, Scott.  How are you?  I'm doing well.  I just want to say I love your movie.  You're a beautiful woman.  Thank you.  She really is beautiful.  And the accent puts her over the top.  Oh, definitely.  I love the English accent.  Yes.  She's one of the hottest out there.  Well, I see that.  You don't have to tell me.  I didn't realize you guys didn't know who she was first off. 
[00:53:30]  No, I've got to be honest.  Beautiful woman, hottest one out there.  Got to be.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  See, it's hard because I don't remember the names very well of porn stars because a lot  of them, they have these generic kind of porn star names.  And yours is one of them, you know.  Yes, but the reason I chose my name is Nicky was always my nickname anyway.  And Sterling is English.  You know, pounds, Sterling, and also quality.  Right.  Quality Marcus Hilda. 
[00:54:00]  Sterling.  Yeah.  And a quality British person, so.  And you're going to be in our whipped cream bikini contest?  Oh, yeah.  Can't wait.  Now, since you've been in the porn industry, can we interest you in another competition  that we do here every so often, but only special girls actually partake in it?  If you pull this one off, Anthony, I will bow to you today.  What is involved?  It's something we call the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  That sounds rude.  We've had.  Yes.  Unfortunately, you're saying that sounds rude. 
[00:54:30]  Our show is rude.  Well, okay, you got us there.  Here's what it is.  It sounds good, but rude.  We have a Whiffle Ball Bat in a glass case.  We will bring it in here and show you.  It's amazing.  Special girls that we deem worthy of the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Only hot porn stars from England.  Yeah.  They have to be able to.  They have to be able to compete.  Right.  This isn't something like a lot of the girls that could just come in here and do the whipped  cream bikini contest.  That's great.  But there's a special select few, much like the special forces or the SEALs, the Navy SEALs, 
[00:55:00]  that special elite force of girls.  Okay.  We offer the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge, too.  What it is is we take the bat, take it out of the case.  You will notice.  Yeah, it's encased in glass.  You will notice marks on the bat.  But a condom is rolled onto the Whiffle Ball Bat.  The Whiffle Ball Bat is then accepted, let's say, by you.  Now, if you're wondering where it's accepted, you're making a poor star blush, Anthony. 
[00:55:30]  That's good.  If you're wondering where it would be accepted, all I can say to have it make the radio is  you would still be able to sit in that seat and whistle a happy tune.  So, does that give you a little...  Yeah.  Okay, and you accept as much as you can, at which point a notch will be made, and at the  end of the year, we will see whose notch is further down the bat, and they will receive  a grand prize, as of yet to be determined, but of huge, huge value. 
[00:56:00]  But more importantly, they'll be crowned Whiffle Ball Bat Champion.  Right.  Now, you know, money, prizes, that's what...  Oh, here it is, let's all, let's all look at it, just look at it.  Look at the bat, Sinky.  Sinky knows how to present the bat.  He does.  Very impressive.  That's the Whiffle Ball Bat.  Yeah.  And it's just, it's really an honor.  If you notice, you see, we've had a few contestants.  It is kept in the most sanitary of conditions, we assure you, with the condoms and whatnot.  And let me just ask, Nicky, would you do the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge here in our studios? 
[00:56:30]  Um, yeah.  Yeah!  God bless you!  Bless you!  God bless you!  I don't know what I'm making myself thankful.  This is fantastic.  It's always a surprise, too.  What's the rubber cup for?  You know why?  He handles the bat in a way where no one else touches this thing.  We want to make sure of all the sanitary conditions.  Look how happy he is. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, we've got to tell everyone.  Sinky, you ran for those medical gloves.  Usually it's like, ah, do I have to?  Do I have to be the one?  Oh, yeah, he was very excited about it.  Can't someone else do it?  He wants a part on the medical show.  But today, you...  Yeah, medical show.  He went right for the gloves today, Ed.  Yeah.  He's definitely our best contestant so far.  Absolutely, Sinky.  I haven't done anything yet.  Absolutely.  Oh, but, I mean, as far as what we can see already, you're going to be the best.  Think she's worth the globalist challenge? 
[00:57:30]  There it is.  Thinking if you would roll a condom over the top of that and show exactly what...  She's got to decide which...  Yeah, that's true, too.  It's a two-ended bat.  I see.  So which end would you like to use?  Well, check out both marks.  There's a couple of impressive marks on there.  There are, though.  That's a good one.  Mm-hmm.  And that one...  That one there.  So that's...  Now, I'm thinking, you know, you're a poem star.  You've probably had a few guys that were comparable to the bat, at least as far as girth goes. 
[00:58:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  And more.  And more.  See?  More girth than that?  But not English guys, right?  Very small for some reason, yes.  She just laughed at that.  No.  Hello.  And that's kind of an English stereotype, that they're not the best, like, lovers.  Is that true?  No, it's not true.  Not at all, really?  No.  Who...  Having been with many different guys from different countries...  Yeah.  Who would you say is the best? 
[00:58:30]  What country?  Yeah.  Okay.  USA.  USA.  Yeah.  There we go.  I could just listen to her talk all day long.  Isn't that great accent?  English accent.  Rock.  Can you say, you are the weakest link, goodbye?  She was a big star over there in England before she came here on that weakest link show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's quite the...  Quite the bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone wants to know if you're...  Hmm.  How can we put this?  Anthony, I need your help there. 
[00:59:00]  Line 11?  Line 11.  Let's see.  Oh.  Oh.  I guess when you...  In your movies, when you are satisfied and finish, your money shot, I guess is unique.  There's a lot of...  Yeah.  A lot of byproduct.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Sometimes.  And that's all real.  Yeah.  Because this guy's wondering if it's real.  It is absolutely real.  It doesn't happen every time, but yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Isn't that a surprise when you get a girl like that?  And you bring her home and all of a sudden, whoa, what happened? 
[00:59:30]  The sprinkler went turned on.  It's very unexpected.  Like when you're walking on the beach in one of those clams, like piss clams they're called.  Yeah.  And it is.  They're called piss clams.  You don't dump out of them because they are called piss clams.  Right.  And you step on the sand and all of a sudden, whoa, right in the eye.  Like, whoa, where did that come from?  Oh, that's cool.  I'm going to have to now...  Steve, bring in your many volumes of pornography.  Yeah.  And I would love to see a couple of Nicky's movies.  This is really strange.  Oh, yeah.  Rain Woman, the Rain Woman series.  Rain Woman.  And now I could only imagine why it's the Rain Woman. 
[01:00:00]  You must be impressive because that guy, and I won't call him out on this, he never comes  in the studio.  Yeah.  Never, ever, ever.  It's like getting quite a crowd in here.  How did you work 19 guys in that movie?  You must look like the one-man band guy at Disney.  Just kind of working it, feet, whatever it takes.  It was pretty well-directed.  I mean, it was, you know, sort of on a rotation kind of thing, and it was just very, very constant.  You were constantly...  Two and a half hours of...  Was everything on you being used at one time? 
[01:00:30]  At some point, yeah.  Yeah.  And you really enjoyed that, huh?  She said she really liked that one.  Yeah.  That's cool.  But it's like locust.  She's like locust.  It's just all over her.  All right.  Wow.  I'm so psyched we're going to be able to have another contestant here.  Yeah.  She's going to be in the whipped cream bikini contest and the Whipple Ball Bat Challenge.  We'll do both of those next, right, Anthony?  Do you need any prep work or anything beforehand?  What's the matter, Rick?  I'm asking. 
[01:01:00]  She's a pro.  She's a professional girl.  What'd she say?  What's that?  What?  Well, I mean...  You can whisper it into Anthony's ear.  What?  Wait, I'll turn your mic off.  Here you go.  What?  In front of everyone?  Well, if you want, we'll have whoever you want to leave, leave.  I mean, Opie and I have to be in here because we have to kind of describe it for the listeners. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  So, yeah, we would have to describe it for the listeners.  But if you don't want anyone else in here, they don't have to be in here.  I think the doctor has to be in.  Oh, Dr. Stinky, would that be?  Stinky?  Hey, don't you have to answer the phone?  What happened to that job?  Intern.  No.  Kiss my ass, Opie.  I'm just waiting for that to come out of him one day.  Let's come out of him already.  All right.  Come on.  Let's go for it. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Let's go for it.  Quick break.  Oh, quick break.  Damn it!  Damn you, Briggs!  Well, she's got to, like, get ready, Anthony.  Okay.  It takes a few minutes, so this will be perfect.  I just don't want an earthquake or something to happen and ruin this.  Yeah, maybe she'll change her mind.  Shut up!  You won't change your mind, will you?  No.  Okay.  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.

We've got this other girl with this just great outfit, nice little, what kind of hat do you call that?  Stinky, who cares?

[01:05:30]  Could you please get those two shots out of here?  1027.  Very cool.  A lot of people checking in to say that Wow got on TRL today.  There you go.  Thank you to that guy, whoever you are.  Very cool when we see Wow and ONA signs on live TV.  Anthony, in the studio, Nicky Sterling.  Yes.  Born star.  From England, of course.  Cheryl from Tenafly checking in. 
[01:06:00]  So when Rick called her Nicky Sterling, I thought he just gave some hot British chick the nickname.  I can't effing believe you actually have Nicky Sterling in the studio.  So a lot of people familiar with your movies, very psyched that you're on this show today.  They're calling in like crazy.  And not only psyched that you're on the show, but that you are actually going to participate in the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Something that you got to know, this doesn't happen very often on this show.  It's a special girl that can do this. 
[01:06:30]  I know.  That's up for the challenge.  Yes.  That's the size of it.  Yeah.  That's the Whiffle Ball Bat, all right.  Joe has something fast for Nicky.  Joe, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Bella.  And Nicky, how you doing?  Hey, very well.  How are you doing?  All right, listen.  I was wondering if you were like aroused at any moment when you were banging those 18  guys.  Yeah.  Do you get turned on when you're doing these movies?  Yes, I do.  You do?  I do.  During that time, obviously, I wasn't orgasming every single moment of the time, but no, 
[01:07:00]  absolutely, I was getting aroused doing it.  Just the whole thrill of it, really, was more sexual than the size of it.  Yeah, she made like gangbang and sound cool.  So were you like hurting by like the fourth, fifth guy?  I was hurting afterwards, but during the time I was having so much fun that no, I didn't  even stop to think about it.  Yeah, that's it.  You're great.  All right, Jeff.  Fantastic.  All right, well, it is now time. 
[01:07:30]  Stinky has the wiffle ball bat in his hands.  He's now preparing the bat.  Preparing the bat with whatever liquids and latex need to be applied to the bat.  Now, what kind of stance are you going to use for this?  What kind of are you going to use?  I'm not sure, but I think we should all sit down.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, right now, as we speak, my lawyers are battling in court on a divorce  case. 
[01:08:00]  Ugly underpants.  No, no crap.  They're really there.  And I'm sure all they'd need to do is turn on WNEW to rest their case.  Imagine that.  Let me just turn on the radio.  And Anthony's naked, and he's got a wiffle ball bat in his hand.  Ultra lube.  Ultra lube.  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  That's a huge bottle.  Ultra lube.  We need it.  We get that stuff by the case.  We have a sponsored deal with it.  It's like an endorsement deal. 
[01:08:30]  Again, dog.  There we go.  Now, Stinky, do you have an appropriate marker to mark the final resting place here of the  wiffle ball bat?  In Rick's hand, yeah.  It's in Rick's hand.  Stinky, you're shaking already.  Now, she's got some in her hand.  She is applying.  I don't think we have to say where.  Keep this on the air.  Oh, look at that.  And the wiffle ball bat.  She has now taken the wiffle ball bat.  Here.  You want a little more?  On that? 
[01:09:00]  That's good.  That'll work?  Here, Stinky, make sure you mic her, because it's always fun to hear the noise.  I will do one of the things I hate about this show.  I will describe the action.  She's got one foot up on the console.  She's sitting in a chair, by the way.  She's used the sitting stance.  Oh, two feet up on the console.  All right.  Yeah, look, everyone's got to look.  And we are beginning the wiffle ball bat challenge.  There you go.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, okay. 
[01:09:30]  And we've started.  We have started, yeah.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Is it a...  Thank you, Lube Boy.  Oh, you did a good job.  Lube Boy, nice.  Good job.  We found a new neighbor.  Are you comfortable?  So far.  So far?  Are you feeling confident?  Are you feeling confident?  You're pretty confident about me.  I've got a big bat somewhere.  A bat, sure.  I can't believe it, Gilman.  And, all right. 
[01:10:00]  We're noticing a little resistance at this point.  Tiny, tiny.  Oh, is that it?  You're tiny?  Tiny.  Maybe if I move.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  She's going to move a little bit.  Feel free.  Oh, oh, oh.  Moving.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now she's using...  Let's see.  What kind of...  Oh, wow.  This is unique.  Oh, wait a minute.  You want Stinky to help you for just this portion of it? 
[01:10:30]  Well, this is the first time we've seen this technique in.  She's using the behind-the-back application method.  I do believe she's kind of a...  Oh.  A switch hitter.  Yeah.  It's...  Okay.  All right.  Now I'm seeing some progress.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  That's pretty good. 
[01:11:00]  Is that a party?  All right.  Mark, it's Stinky.  Stinky is going.  Stinky's like the guy at the pit crew.  All right.  Stinky's marked it.  And nice.  Nicky, give her a big hand.  Wow.  This is sterling.  Oh, the first time's better.  Wow.  She actually changed position to get a better score.  Ooh, you made me blush.  New record.  A new record. 
[01:11:30]  That's a winner.  That sure is, Marko.  Oh, my God.  A new record.  Bravo.  New record.  Yeah.  Oh, as the Olympic music plays in the background.  Nicky Sterling.  The latest to try the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  And, so far, the new leader in the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Nicky Sterling.  Hey, what does Bob Murphy think of that?  I think that's the best way I've ever seen a bat use. 
[01:12:00]  It's out of here.  No way.  She's turning around.  Yeah, what was happening with the feet on the console thing?  You were, I think you were bent a little weird.  Wrong angle.  Yeah, she couldn't get around the corner.  No, I think something was in the way.  Her spine.  So then, so then when she, she went the other way with it.  And had to look, actually look over her shoulder.  That thing disappeared.  Yeah.  And then she, she got the final mark, which is the lead. 
[01:12:30]  Now you're in.  Yeah, she is the Whiffle Ball Bat Champion as of now.  You're going to have to sign our bat for us.  Oh, yeah.  We would be privileged if you were to do that.  I wonder if that's going to start a trend in the way this is done now.  You know, you ever notice in professional sports when somebody does something and it's  like, wow, that works, everyone adopts that style, we might start seeing, what do you want  to call it?  It could be like the new rendition of the Fosbury Flop.  The turnaround. 
[01:13:00]  I don't know what to call it.  The bottom's up.  We'll come up with something.  Right.  Yeah.  Great job, though.  The squeeze play, no?  The squeeze play.  And the bunt.  It's the bat in, well.  We have the whipped cream bikini contest still.  Which, of course, Nikki's going to be in her whipped cream bikini very soon and the  pictures will be up on www.com.  What a great job.  Also, NikkiSterling.com.  No, what's your website? 
[01:13:30]  It's www.NikkiSterling.com.  How are you spelling Nikki?  N-I-C-I.  N-I-C-I.  There's not a lot of girls that spell it that way.  No, that was my website.  N-I-C-I-Sterling.com.  Check out her website.  She's beautiful.  Yes.  Let's go to Matt really fast here.  Matt, what's going on?  Oh, hey, long time listener.  Just wondering what movies that girl's in.  Matt, how old are you?  What does that matter?  I'm just curious.  What are you, Ben?  What does it matter?  Give me the goddamn 20.  Why? 
[01:14:00]  No, it doesn't matter.  We're curious.  We're just curious.  Oh, I'm 15.  15.  You like the porno, do you?  Yeah, I guess.  When you can find it for free?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Most definitely.  All right.  She's been in a lot of movies, so.  Frank's suggesting the new stance be called the Louima.  I don't think that's very appropriate.  No, because it wasn't there.  No, it wasn't there.  It wasn't there.  It was just, it was, it was just. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Come on, Cowbell Bill.  We should.  You know what?  Cowbell Bill, put him on hold.  Oh, good God.  She's getting completely naked now, isn't she?  Wow.  Whoa, look at that.  A broader match.  Oh, she wants a picture with the bat.  Oh, she's got the bat between her, um, her, uh, boobs.  Yeah.  I can say that.  Hey, Rick, you gonna put that on the website?  And crown her the wiffle ball bat champion, right?  Yep.  Yes, we are. 
[01:15:00]  I got a picture of her holding the bat in there.  Very nice.  Cowbell Bill.  There you go.  Hey, what do you say, guys?  What's up?  Hey.  What's going on?  This girl is freaking hot, Bill.  She's the new leader of the wiffle ball bat challenge, but she used a unique stance.  Yeah, you know, I was thinking the same thing, Rick, was with the Pottsberry flop.  Yeah.  You know, when somebody comes up with something new, then, you know, everybody's gonna go with it.  How about the, uh, the Sterling slip?  The Sterling slip.  We should definitely name it after her.  We've got to name the move after, uh, Nikki Sterling. 
[01:15:30]  The Nikki Nudge.  The Nikki Nudge.  Hey, Bill.  Yeah.  You want a martini?  You better didn't tell you, did he?  Oh, yeah.  We got a story to tell.  We didn't say anything on the air, but I heard you had a lot of fun with a few martinis at a...  We had a little fun with a few martinis, a, uh, a parking cone, you know.  And some bouncers, and...  Yeah, you know, now, I asked Joe nicely, don't, you know, say anything, you know, it doesn't 
[01:16:00]  need to be spread around.  We haven't said anything yet.  Hey, compared to Ben, you're, uh, you're sober as a judge, believe me.  Well, you know, when I, when I heard, uh, you know, Ben's little story, I felt like I  was squeaky clean.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, uh, did Joe tell you his little problem on the way home?  What?  Driving home?  Yeah.  What, did he get pulled over?  No.  Oh, wow.  Did he wet himself?  Well, if my story gets out on the air, his story's getting out on the air. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's a lot worse than mine.  I will see who, uh, you know, who cracks first.  Although, not knowing the stories, like, uh, as, as the listeners just listening, it's, it sounds a lot worse to be Joe right now than it does to be Bill.  I would not know in the back.  Bill is.  I would say so.  I would say so.  Bill's that confident.  You're that confident, Bill.  No wonder Joe didn't, uh, say it on the air.  You got dirt on him. 
[01:17:00]  Nice.  Very nice.  I'm good.  I can't wait to hear this.  All right, Bill.  Well, let's put it this way, um, you know, a couple of years ago, whatever, I came up with the term cranky, yes.  Yeah.  And that was a story that had to do with your brother on the golf course.  Right.  Let's just say he blows that story away.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Well, all right, Bill.  All right.  I got to run.  I'm going to run in the house.  I'll put you guys on and we'll see.  We'll take it from there.  All right, Bill.  All right, Bill. 
[01:17:30]  The sterling slide, the sterling slip.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  There's something going on there.  It's just going to get ugly.  It'll come out.  But, uh, Nicky Sterling with the, what are we going to call it?  The sterling slip?  The sterling slide?  I don't know.  How about the reverse?  A lot of people want to know which end of the bat.  It would be the end that, uh, Mark McGuire uses to hit home run.  Right.  That's right.  The sterling home run.  Yeah, you hit a home run with that one.  Yeah, we'll come up with a, uh, clever little baseball term for it.  We have a tape measure, Stink?  A lot of people wondering, uh...  Yeah, we do have one. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  Pete will help it.  Pete.  But now you're going to have to take your pants off again to do the whipped cream bikini.  Oh, yeah.  I can't wait.  Yeah.  I just, uh...  You want to get the other girls in while Stinky gets the, uh, tape measure?  We'll talk to, uh, some of the other contestants.  And don't forget, NickySterling.com.  N-I-C-I-Sterling.com.  The official measurement coming up now.  Stinky has the ruler.  He is measuring.  Stinky. 
[01:18:30]  What's the official measurement?  Seven inches.  Seven.  Of a wiffle ball bat, people.  Think about it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's all right.  Right on.  There you have it.  We have, uh, two more ladies in the studio that are beautiful.  And, and, of course, uh, Stinky's sister that's doing the reshoot.  So, we're going to have four, uh, brand new, uh, ladies in the whipped cream bikini contest  and the new feature.  Girls, you look like special ladies that I think would be up for the wiffle ball bat. 
[01:19:00]  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding, of course.  Please, yes.  You want to, you want to try?  No.  She's, like, giving the face, like, no.  No, no.  She goes, please.  I'm like, oh, my God, really?  She's really going to try?  No, you're not up for that?  No.  But they're in.  Not today.  They're in for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah, which is great.  Where are you guys from?  Morristown.  Morristown?  Yeah.  Um, Montague?  Uh.  New Jersey.  Oh, okay.  There's a town I've never heard of before. 
[01:19:30]  It's Jersey.  It's Jersey.  Cool.  This chick looks like she smokes a lot of pot, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can just tell.  You got, like, a pot look to you.  Like, you like smoking pot.  She's got kind of the pot giggle going on.  Yeah.  Legalize it.  Legalize it.  Legalize it.  Tell you, are you talking with Barbie out there?  Medical marijuana Barbie?  Would you rather drive a car drunk or soaking pot?  Hey, Paul.  You're going to be careful.  A little heroin and crack, too.  I don't care.  I like it all. 
[01:20:00]  That is so true.  But wait.  I like a morphine drip as I'm driving.  Right there on the dashboard.  I want to pass out and wake up ten exits down the highway.  But we've got to heed the advice of Joe Friday.  Marijuana is an arcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm.  Well, it's Joe Friday.  You've got to listen to Joe Friday.  Smoke weed every day.  When was the last time you smoked?  20 minutes ago.  Like driving before you came up?  Yeah.  Stinky's got pot.  Stinky always has pot. 
[01:20:30]  Were you in the stairwell?  Nobody hooked me up.  So, you know, what's up with that?  Stinky.  Get the one hitter, man.  Get the dugout.  The dugout.  The dugout.  The baseball bat.  Yeah.  And the wiffle ball bat going back up on the shelf.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Again.  You know, the audience breaks out in spontaneous applause when it comes to the wiffle ball bat challenge.  I'm not going to be having that now.  All right.  So, she needs pot.  She needs to get into a whipped cream bikini.  She's drinking. 
[01:21:00]  What are you into?  If it was 80s, I'd say Coke.  But no.  Right?  No.  The blonde's beautiful.  A little shy.  Are you a little shy?  Wow.  Who are you?  I'm just going to Hawaii and getting laid.  You just got it?  Really?  Come on, go.  Wait.  What'd she say?  She goes, she's going to Hawaii and getting laid.  You know, the play on words.  Oh.  You know, laid.  I got distracted because another lovely girl just said that.  Look at this.  Who is that?  I'm a sister.  Yeah, really. 
[01:21:30]  It's Stinky's other sister.  Deirdre, hi.  Hi.  Are you related to her?  No, but we're from the same area.  You guys kind of look alike a little bit.  A little bit.  Like you could be sisters or cousins or something, you know?  It's a family picture.  Yeah, take a family picture.  Get in there, Stinky.  Yeah.  Stinky, get in there for your family photo.  Make sure you smile real big.  Everybody, lots of teeth.  There you go.  Lots of teeth, Stinky.  You got a smile, Stinky.  Give the same smile.  Right.  There they go.  God.  Hey, we got a party today, Anthony.  Hell yeah.  I want to come back.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  You can come back any time you want.  Did you like your Jaeger?  Yes.  Good stuff.  Thank you.  Do you need more?  No.  Need some heroin or something?  We got anything you need.  No?  Some skin poppers or something?  I'm teasing, of course.  You're turning her off, man.  We don't advocate drug use on this show.  With the laughter of the show.  Anthony, you're going to ruin it.  We don't have many porn star friends.  I know.  All right.  All right, so are you ladies ready for the whipped cream bikini contest?  She is so stoned, man.  Are you? 
[01:22:30]  No, I swear to God.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Completely.  You're just, like, happy.  I'm just nervous.  That's cool.  Oh, don't be nervous.  If you had to put, you know, whipped cream on and...  Yeah.  But don't be nervous.  ...and, you know, bad lighting, you might be a little nervous.  See, the bad lighting again.  Yeah, see.  The bad lighting.  I'm sorry.  The lighting is better.  You know what we're going to need?  We're going to have to have a consultant, because we do a lot of these.  We're going to have to have a photographic lighting consultant come in, recommend some lighting  equipment.  We have to buy it and set it up.  So when we do these, it looks really good. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, she's on to something there.  I think she's on something.  Not on to something.  I'm not.  I know.  Oh, paranoid?  I'm kidding.  Don't be nervous, though.  There's cameras all around.  Don't worry about it, though.  Can I do my plug before we go?  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Plug.  What?  I want to see what you're plugging.  Yeah, what do you plug?  There's another cute girl outside the studio.  That's my sister.  She drove me here.  Is she doing this thing?  I go, drive me here, and I'll do a plug for your bar. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, what bar?  What bar?  It's the side bar in Morristown, New Jersey.  It's a piano bar.  Oh, really?  All right.  The piano bar.  Action.  Cool.  Okay.  Did I say it's the right bar?  Side bar?  Oh, my gosh.  No, it was the wrong one.  What you meant to say.  Side bar.  The side bar.  The side bar.  Yes.  You can smoke cigars and hang out on the couch, and all the cool people hang there.  Oh, yeah?  A lot of hot guys.  Nice.  Nice.  We like the hot guy places. 
[01:24:00]  It's hot.  Morristown is very cool, and it's 20 minutes away from the Short Hills Mall,  so, hey.  Oh, okay.  What more can you on?  I think we just...  Oh, you are?  Yeah, I'll be at a Double D's.  Double?  No more time.  Cool.  Double D's strip club.  It's the place to go.  Yeah.  Go there.  Go there.  Do you dance?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Okay.  Yeah, I'll be doing the VIP party tonight.  Obviously.  It'll be really, really nice.  Can you flash us?  I know.  Oh, a little wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Look how easy that was, that thing.  No tan line either. 
[01:24:30]  Huh?  No tan line.  No tan line.  No.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Tanning booth.  Fully nude.  Wow.  That works.  You're going to look great in a whipped cream bikini.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break.  We've got a lot of ladies here for the whipped cream bikini contest.  One more day to qualify tomorrow, Anthony.  What happened?  What's up your shirt?  Oh, yeah.  I want to see you.  Sure.  She's going to wow.  This is the marijuana girl.  Too late.  You are already.  It's too late.  It's the hot girl.  Whoa, yeah.  Hey, look at that. 
[01:25:00]  I think we just found Psycho Mark's wife.  Yeah.  Is that a good thing?  Yeah.  Psycho Mark loves the pot.  Medical marijuana Barbie's back.  She's got her pink hair still.  I hate this chick.  Why do you?  What's the matter, O-Bank?  She gives too much rhetoric.  You know, you're putting me in a hard position.  Why's that?  In between the Whistleball Bat Contest and the Bikini.  And the whipped cream bikini.  Bikini Bikini Contest.  I'm just medical marijuana Barbie.  Yeah.  She's just marijuana chick. 
[01:25:30]  She likes pot.  She likes smoking pot.  That's cool.  Look, see?  She's all laughing, but she's not smoking pot right now.  You got any pot on you, medical marijuana Barbie?  No, I did make a medical marijuana delivery this morning.  You did?  Which was photographed by the Daily News.  Oh, right.  Next week, there's going to be a story about me in the Daily News.  You dropped off pot to what was wrong with this person?  To a medical marijuana patient.  She had glaucoma.  Not glaucoma.  She has arthritis.  I just pictured Psycho Mark coming to the door in a dress.  I got arthritis.  Drop it off in my mail slot. 
[01:26:00]  I can't come to the door, you bitch.  Someone said that medical marijuana was a boring issue.  Who was that?  Me.  Yes, that was good.  It's good for PMS.  Oh, yeah?  Anybody got women on PMS?  Yeah, Queen Victoria.  Yeah, so the ball peen hammer.  Queen Victoria.  I'm kidding.  Please, why does she look at me like this?  So is a strip club.  Yeah, medical marijuana, not really on the number one slot of fun talk. 
[01:26:30]  Well, actually, yeah.  There's a lot of stigma associated with medical marijuana.  See, when you start using words like stigma, bad.  Bad.  We were just saying wiffle ball bad.  Oh, yeah.  And now stigma.  Well, there's a lot of...  Do you realize this girl to your left can squirt?  I heard that.  Well, it's a pain to look.  Of course.  How do you know?  I was listening to the radio when you were on.  Hey, is the carpet match the curtains over there with the pink hair?  Good question.  Did you do that?  Well, no, I didn't go to all that trouble. 
[01:27:00]  That is a festive color, isn't it?  It is beautiful.  Very bright, bright pink.  Thank you.  So show up at the parade on Saturday and...  Oh, there's a parade?  Yeah.  Oh, somebody was calling in about this.  Some kind of marijuana march parade.  Yeah, a million marijuana march.  Million marijuana march.  It starts at...  Why does everyone steal my ideas?  It starts at 1 o'clock on Saturday at Broadway and Houston.  But everyone will get there at 5.  I was going to say, hey, man.  What time is it?  Oh, man.  There's going to be movies made. 
[01:27:30]  You'll be dues on.  I can't leave.  So, yeah, I've been in New York for a couple months promoting the march.  And we were in the New York Times city section on Sunday.  I cleaned out my pot on that section.  Good section.  I let the seeds roll off the paper.  So medical marijuana is really becoming an issue, kind of like AIDS activism used to be an issue.  Ah, but then they cured that.  You don't hear anything about it anymore.  Well, actually, many AIDS patients are gay.  And in fact, there's a big, there's a whole, a large overlap between the AIDS activists and the medical marijuana activists. 
[01:28:00]  And there's a whole group of people coming in for the march called Queers for Weed.  Queers for Weed.  Michael Mark heads up that organization, as a matter of fact.  So if you want to meet Queers for Weed at Sheridan Square at 11 o'clock.  Queers for Weed.  You know, gay people don't have enough problems, man.  Where do you hop on the weed bandwagon?  You're a buzzkill.  We just saw something with a whiffle ball bat. 
[01:28:30]  But we had Tony.  Everyone else is flashing us.  I love it.  That's really nice.  All right.  Okay.  Well, we'll all be there Saturday.  Thanks for the welcome.  We'll be there Saturday, smoking pot and marching.  Well, Barbie, you just got bad timing, that's all.  Yeah, anything would be boring in between the whiffle ball bat and the shaming.  You chose to walk in in the middle of an orgy, basically.  Yeah.  There are lovely women down here, so.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Thank you, Medical Marijuana Barbie. 
[01:29:00]  Good luck.  Thanks for having me on.  To you and all your pot ventures.  And maybe she should hear Joe Friday right before she goes.  Marijuana is an archaic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good and does everybody a lot of harm.  There you go.  What do you think of Joe Friday?  Right.  He's not correct.  And he's dead.  See where that got him?  All right.  We're going to take a break and we're going to get the ladies in there.  Whip Cream Bikinis, Anthony.  Medical Marijuana Barbie, you look like the special kind of girl that I think should do 
[01:29:30]  the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Well, that would answer the question once and for all if I'm anatomically correct.  Oh, I get it.  We'll be right back.  I like, I like, I like small boys.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You are officially out of control.  Agreed?  1-0-2-7.  1-0-2-7.  S-E-W.  Anthony, today's nudity sponsored by Sam Adams.

Black Crow's playing with Oasis and Spatog, June 7th at Radio City Music Hall.  It's the O&A Show.  Thanks for checking us out today. 
[01:31:00]  Medical Marijuana Barbies.  What a bug kill.  Who cares?  She does, Opie, very passionately.  Jesus.  She walked into a nice little party, too.  Who would think the marijuana chick would wreck the party?  Yeah, the pot chick.  My God.  The marijuana chick wrecked the party.  That doesn't happen often.  No, no. 
[01:31:30]  She didn't wreck it.  She just tried to.  Hey, and I'm getting so much flack on instant feedback about the stinky cam.  We're working on it.  Don't you think we would have put that on the stinky cam if it was working?  Jackasses.  We're going to have some great pictures up on WNAW.com in the very near future, Andy.  Yeah.  We have girls naked all over the joint.  The whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah.  Ladies get qualified today and tomorrow.  And that is it.  And that's it. 
[01:32:00]  Pick our finalists, and then you get to vote.  And pick the winner that will go to Hawaii.  You can start voting on Monday.  Okay.  I guess Joe Friday was right about pot.  Didn't do anything for anyone.  It's bad.  Bad for the radio show.  Oh, I hate that.  Ben hates her, too.  Can't stand her.  Yeah.  I think Rick did that on purpose, just to get under my skin today.  Just to F with you a little bit? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, it worked.  Yeah, let's talk to a chick about the medical uses for marijuana for the next hour.  I don't like fun pot stories.  Well, you know, you hear from guys that are like, it's so stoned.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we got our mic set up?  Let's take a look.  Is this on?  Hey, let's just do the whole show like this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  There we go.  Just tell me if we're good over here. 
[01:33:00]  Hold on.  Here we go.  It's so funny because coming out of commercials, I go to Anthony.  Anthony, you know, we should probably do like a normal straight break about something else.  Yeah.  And it's like, yeah, I got a good story about Rod Stewart and stuff.  We could do that.  Went right out the window.  Right.  As soon as we found out that a porn star is naked.  Wow, she is naked.  Look at that.  Could you turn that monitor down there, Stinky?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Nikki Sterling.  Oh, here we go.  That's NikkiSterling.com. 
[01:33:30]  N-I-C-I-Sterling.com is getting her whipped cream bikini.  We meet together, Anthony, outside the studio.  Right now, Rick covering up the vitals right there.  That's a little big, Rick, wouldn't you say?  Especially for a porn star.  Yeah.  Well, maybe that's what she wants in it.  Rick, you know what?  Just shake it up a lot and just splatter it all over us so she looks like that 19-guy gangbang that she did.  No?  No.  Yeah, Rick. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  It dribbled out.  Now, if these pictures don't come out well, then we know there's a problem with the lighting and the camera and everything else around here because Nikki's beautiful.  She's sticking to the floor.  Rick.  There you go.  Very nice.  Ah, yeah.  See, she's got the posing and everything, Anthony.  She's got the posing down.  All right.  Hip, hip, cheerio, and all that rot. 
[01:34:30]  Are the other girls getting naked or?  Are the other girls getting naked?  Oh, hey, look at Ask and You Shall Receive.  Hey, there you go.  She's going to be dancing at Double D's.  I'm the Plug Meissner.  And the Pot Girl's naked now.  Hey, what size are those over there?  Opie, you're usually the pro on this.  Those are...  Well, you're like a 34, right? 
[01:35:00]  Maybe 32.  Yeah, 32 C?  C's.  34 C, okay.  All right.  That works.  She's lying there, large B's.  I'm a large B's.  I'm never wrong.  Very nice.  And she'll be at Double D's tonight.  And she's completely naked.  Oh, completely naked now.  There you go.  Oh, look at that.  She's got a...  She's completely...  Yes.  She's sporting the JonBenet Ramsey, as we call it here. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  Well, we'll let the photo shoot continue.  Okay, Rick, do your magic.  We'll come back into the studio.  We'll come back out in a little bit,  but I know this is pretty boring for everyone in Radio Land.  All righty.  Yeah!  Yeah!  This contest is getting better and better, Anthony.  You want to shut that door?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll come back out when the rest of the girls are naked. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  There you have it.  Rick is really enjoying his job these days.  Well, today especially.  Yeah.  He just loves putting on that whipped cream.  We're upping the talent.  We have four girls out there that could all easily be finalists.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So...  All right, Anthony, what do you have on Rod Stewart?  Well...  You know, with the fun marriage situation I've had, Opie, 
[01:36:30]  I've got to agree with this nut.  Skirt-chasing rockers.  You know what they've got to call you in the paper?  Skirt-chasing rocker Rod Stewart says a marriage license should be more like a dog license.  Renewable every year.  How true is that, though?  How come if you get married, everything's fine, the year goes by, everything's fine, you re-up.  Right.  Both parties are happy.  You talk about it, you re-up for another year.  Can you spray them down once a year or two and make sure they get their shots? 
[01:37:00]  If need be.  If need be.  Right.  Make sure they get their injections.  And then every year, you re-up.  And you go, all right, yeah, I'm into it for another year.  But if one of the parties aren't happy, you don't have to re-up.  And that's it.  Rod Stewart is saying that this whole institution of marriage and stuff,  has been in existence for like 600 years when people used to live until they were only 35, Stewart said. 
[01:37:30]  So they had to be with each other for 12 years, then they would die anyway.  So he's saying now that people live longer, that they're stuck with each other for longer,  so they ought to change the marriage laws.  This from a guy who's like, how do you make the mistake twice, three, four times of getting married?  So his whole take on this is that people live longer, and now they're stuck with the same people. 
[01:38:00]  He's on to something there a little bit, right?  Well, he's living longer, but he's picking up youngsters is what he's doing.  He's now dating this 29-year-old chick, Penny Lancaster.  And he's 50, I'd guess 53-ish.  He's 56.  Wow.  56.  And has just, you know, of course, been dumped by a supermodel, Rachel Hunter, after eight years and two kids.  You know what, I think Rod turned her in. 
[01:38:30]  What do you mean?  For a new model.  No, he said that she dumped him, and it was the first time he was ever dumped.  And he's feeling, you know, he never had to deal with it.  But he got dumped.  So he's drowning his sorrows with hot, young porn stars.  Yeah, yeah.  29-year-old chicks.  His first marriage to Alana Hamilton in 79 lasted five years.  He had two children from her.  Kelly Enberg had a daughter from. 
[01:39:00]  This guy just goes around fouling like hot women.  And then when they get a little long in the tooth, he ships them off after having a few kids.  It's not like, it's not like, I don't, I think he doesn't like it loosened up down there.  Maybe that's it.  Couple of kids come down the water slide.  It ain't fun no more.  Anthony, I got a confession.  Yeah?  I think naked girls are wrecking our show.  I can't concentrate.  I know, I see you.  What?  Naked Laura! 
[01:39:30]  Ha ha!  Naked Laura.  Awesome!  Awesome!  All right, Rick's getting some great pictures.  Yeah, it'll all be up on the website.  Right.  But I got to agree with this.  Every year, you re-up.  Sal, what's going on?  Hey, is this O&A?  Yeah.  How you doing?  I think the marriage should be like a lease.  Every three years, you just re-up like a car lease.  And if you want to go in and go back and get married, just say, all right.  Yeah, and it's all like, the guy's got a point with a car lease. 
[01:40:00]  So you've got to think about how the machine performed over the three years.  That's right.  I agree, as long as you don't have to pay for the extra miles.  Extra miles.  Or any accidents you've had on it.  You guys are great, man.  All right, Sal.  Take care.  You look, you drive a leased car, and if it gives you trouble, a lot of things have been recalled on it or something, it's not running good.  If that's the case, just like a leased car, can you turn back the miles?  It's not before you re-up. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, yeah, have somebody turn the mileage back on it?  Turn the mileage back on your lady?  You know, I've done some thinking on the whole institution of marriage and the divorce angle of it.  It's good, right, eh?  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's a wonderful experience.  The whole thing is, I was thinking this, why do the courts, if the courts made a decree that women are so inferior and incompetent to men  that without a man taking care of them, they will wither on the vine and die? 
[01:41:00]  If all of a sudden this was a decree that the Supreme Court put out, do you think you'd hear now in women's organizations rioting?  Of course.  Of course, you can't say that.  But in divorce court, they say it all the time.  Oh, now, because you were married, you now have to pay through the nose this woman you were with. 
[01:41:30]  And her lawyer will argue, yeah, oh, she can't make it on her own.  Oh, it's going to be horrible for her.  Why does it now get involved?  Hey, you want to be equal?  You want equal pay?  Because there's always things in the paper about equal pay and equal respect and this and job opportunities.  What about equality in the divorce court?  You'll never see it.  Because you're whores.  Wow.  You'll never see that.  Anthony, we've got some lovely females that listen to this radio show. 
[01:42:00]  What the courts are saying is exactly that, that women can't handle it.  They're inferior and incompetent and cannot survive.  Gary, what's up?  What's up, ONA?  Hey.  I've got something to say about this marriage garbage.  Yes.  You know, in the vows, when you say this, it's like to good times and bad times, for rich and for poor, to death do you part.  There's no divorce in that agreement.  Now, my question is, when you get divorced, let's say she wants out because she can't take it. 
[01:42:30]  She can't take the pressure.  She gets more of it than you do.  You wind up spending $30,000 for the frigging lawyer, and you lose your house, and you lose everything, and you lose your whole family.  Yeah.  It's all gauged toward the girl being the poor thing that can't get along without your taking care of her for the rest of the world.  Oh, please.  Let me tell you.  Women love attention more than anything.  So, the minute another guy gives them attention, they're like, well, you know, he's not giving me the romance that I used to get, so let me just hop on the next peg that comes walking by. 
[01:43:00]  Hop on the next peg.  You know what I'm talking about, Anthony.  You're going through the world.  You know what I'm talking about.  No, I'm just looking at it from the other angle.  I'm not talking about the sex thing or the vows or what.  Just legally, legally, the court has said that women are inferior and incompetent when it comes to taking care of themselves. 
[01:43:30]  They've said it.  Where's the outrage of the women's groups?  The court is saying that you're not up to snuff.  You can't take care of yourself.  You need a man to take care of you.  Where's the outrage?  You don't say it because they're getting away with murder.  Hoo-ah!  Paul, what's going on?  You know, we should just treat this thing like a business contract.  They go into it.  They sign in.  You agree on the terms.  And that's it. 
[01:44:00]  And if you up or renew one year or one year you don't up for a renew, this is a consenting contract between the two.  If you have kids, you write in the contract, this is what I'm going to provide.  It's called a prenup.  There is a contract.  It's called a prenup.  The trouble is when you get married and you're in a situation where you're just a working Joe and you're not making that much, you don't think about making a prenup.  I say this to everybody, whether you're a carpenter, whether you're laying roofs, whether you're a ditch digger. 
[01:44:30]  If you're getting married, go to a lawyer and get a prenup.  It sounds ridiculous for somebody that's, you know, clearing maybe $300, $400, $500 a week.  But, God damn, you never know what's going to happen.  You scratch a lottery ticket, all of a sudden you're rich.  Hey, you're effed if something happens.  And you've got to write out the lawyers.  You've got to be able to have this thing agreed between the two.  No outside counsel. 
[01:45:00]  Let's stop getting the lawyers rich on this stuff because they're dragging out divorces.  And more money.  That's a huge scam.  Tell me about it.  No kids, no real estate, no nothing.  This case of mine has been going on forever because that fat prick keeps postponing stuff.  Right, my brother took 10 years to get divorced.  And he's a lawyer.  And he said the reason why, he goes, I'm going to bleed her.  So she comes back and throws her hands up in the air.  You know, I mean, come on.  This is ridiculous in the age of reason, you know? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Let's settle it between ourselves.  All right, Paul, thank you.  All right, I've got to go listen to myself.  That'll never happen.  But I like the contract idea.  Yeah.  You decide, ah, I'm good for five.  Good for five years.  Five years.  Yeah, five years.  And then there's a renewal thing in there that you can decide yes or no about.  You've got a re-signing option.  Why not?  I like it.  Wendy.  Yes.  What's up?  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  I just want to say I agree with Anthony about the alimony thing.  I mean, every story is different.  Like if the woman puts a man through college and she has no job now or whatever, 
[01:46:00]  and he leaves her after he gets his diploma, it's a different story.  But I think she has just as much opportunity as he does to support herself.  I agree.  Unless you're crippled or retarded or you can't work, you know, sure, that could be taken into consideration.  Right.  But if you're a healthy human being that could go out and earn a living, what the hell is it?  Why the hell would a court say that you've got to support somebody?  Right.  I mean, kids are different.  No, no, if the marriage didn't work, it doesn't mean you've got to be supported the rest of your life. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  I agree.  I think kids...  Ah, sorry about that.  Oh, man.  Steve, what's up?  What's up?  Crippled or retarded.  That's hilarious.  Anyway, comparing marriages to dog licenses is a terrible insult to the institution of dog licensing.  Yeah, right.  That was good.  He got mad at himself.  Robert, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Good. 
[01:47:00]  I was married for almost 20 years, right?  Hey, my wife ends up having an affair, so she ends up going with me to get divorced.  She has custody of kids.  Three years down the line, I mean, I end up giving up my house, everything I own, plus, you know, a lot of money, the house, the whole nine yards.  Three years down the line, she doesn't want the kids anymore.  Guess what happens?  You get the kids.  I get the kids.  Guess what happens to the house and the money?  Oh, you don't have it anymore.  Don't have nothing.  So you got the kids, but you have no house to live in and no money to help them out. 
[01:47:30]  Right, nothing.  I got to go to court now and try to get child support.  Guess what?  When you have custody of the kids as a man, you don't get it.  Of course you don't, because women need that because they're so fragile and frail and incompetent and inferior to men.  That's what the courts are saying.  It has to be.  The courts are saying it.  That's the way they're treating these cases, so it must be true, right?  Yeah.  Right, lady?  It's disgusting.  Now, she married a guy that's really wealthy, and I'm sitting here trying to make ends meet. 
[01:48:00]  It's tough.  Yeah, people don't see the sarcasm in my voice to go F themselves.  I just don't know why the women don't get all angry about the way they're being portrayed in the courtrooms.  Hey, I want equal rights.  I want the rights the same way as my wife, every time there's an argument about it, she always puts the kids on.  The kids up front.  The kids up front.  Right.  Now, all of a sudden, I got the kids.  Now, how come my kid can't get any child support?  They don't want equality.  They want the teeter-totter to go in their direction. 
[01:48:30]  They don't want to give anything on the other side when it comes to something like that.  You want absolute equality?  Then fess up in court cases like this.  You know, like I said, she married a guy that's really wealthy, man, and I'm just sitting here, like I said.  And you're getting aft.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Bye, bro.  All right.  Nice to be part of the fraternity.  Anthony, the lovely Nikki Sterling wants to say goodbye.  Nikki.  Oh, Nikki, thank you.  Thanks for coming down.  Thank you.  Our new wiffle ball bat champion.  Yeah.  Winging off to L.A., I guess.  This is the third time I've been on live radio, and I have to say, I've had so much fun. 
[01:49:00]  And to stand here and say, I have done things today that I have never done before.  And she's been in how many films?  Are you guys?  How many films?  I mean, it's just, it's been so much fun.  Cool.  I've really had a great time.  Quite flattered.  You ever hear of the bridge?  Of who?  Oh, the bridge.  Something we learned about.  Yeah, something we learned about earlier.  And Nikki, let me leave an open invitation.  If you're back in New York any time, you drop in and say hi.  Could you bring some girlfriends next time?  We have that, you know that couch you were sitting on outside for a little while? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  That's the lesbian couch.  It's called the lesbian couch.  I got some stains on it.  Yes.  You saw the stains, right?  Yes.  We fulfill lesbian fantasies.  Tell me those things disturbed you.  They did, right?  I thought they were.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, probably.  They're exactly what you think they are.  A lot of girls want to try it out and have the urges to do lesbian with their friends or something.  And they don't know how to go about it.  We invite the girls down and just throw them on the couch.  Yeah.  And they're able to fulfill our fantasies.  Right.  We're like the Make-A-Wish Foundation for perverts. 
[01:50:00]  Isn't it kind of weird to see her with like a really nice pocketbook?  I know.  Look at that.  It's like you would look at her walking down and go, wow, you're a fashionable, attractive woman.  And meanwhile, you had 18 guys doing a money shot on you.  Look at all the diamonds and the bling bling.  I mean, the girl's happening.  Or no, very, very good to her.  Well, Nikki, come back soon, okay?  Good luck.  Thank you.  I will thank you.  All right.  It's Nikki Sterling.  Bye-bye.  Thank you, man, for getting that.  N-I-C-I-Sterling.com. 
[01:50:30]  Yes, NikkiSterling.com.  A lot of people will be checking out.  Now, I know at the pay side we have problems with that.  But you did some great stuff for us, so I'm not going to complain today.  But there is like a free thing.  Okay, good.  There you go.  Just to wet your whistle.  All right.  Thank you, Nikki.  Thanks.  She's beautiful.  The champion.  Yes, the champion.  True.  All right.  Carl, what's going on?  Hey, ONA.  Listen, you guys were talking about the renewing the lease for marriage, correct? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Real simple.  If you're on good behavior, you've got to have a support that you can come in like Arliss,  renegotiate to get you the anal claws or the backdoor action if you do decide to renew.  Exactly.  I mean, that's what we were talking about, the anal claws.  All right.  Thank you, Carl.  Thanks, guys.  Donna has a question for you, Anthony, because you're an expert on this lately.  Yes.  Donna.  Yes.  Go ahead.  I'm just wondering, and I didn't get the whole conversation.  I came kind of late.  But if I make more money than my husband do, I have to then pay him alimony. 
[01:51:30]  It's so rare that that ever, ever happens.  I'm sure there are instances that it does happen, and I don't know why, how, who, but I've yet  to meet anyone that that's happened to, and I've spoken to a lot of people.  It just seems to me like the way it's laid out, the way the lawyers treat these things.  I don't really think that's fair.  I mean, I can work. 
[01:52:00]  I'm an able-bodied person, and I always took it that the reason the woman got alimony  was because the guy made more money.  So I'm wondering, if I make more money, do I have to then pay him?  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  I really don't know.  But it just seems to me I rarely hear anything like that.  So, whatever.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  We're going to move off the subject before you have an aneurysm.  Oh, go.  Yeah.  Thank you.  What happened? 
[01:52:30]  Because now I'm looking at my watch.  I'm like, okay, I wonder how much of my life has been chiseled away this afternoon between  the 3 and 5.30.  It's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  I'm trying to find Lullaby by Steven Lynch.  Ah, that'll be nice.  A little break, but Tommy, real fast.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Quick thing.  Actually, it's funny you're talking about this divorce issue.  My dad just finalized his divorce today after, like, 9, 10 months.  He was married to, like, the biggest, trash, big alcoholic.  And then before then, he was married to my mom, obviously. 
[01:53:00]  And my mom, she had me and my brother.  She raised us, like, 15 years.  Finally, she kicked us out of the house.  But, you know, now your father's going to raise you.  And she didn't realize my dad took her to court.  And my dad did get all the child support back.  Okay.  Right up our ass.  He snuck it to her.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  People always sound so happy when they're, like, kind of, right up our ass.  All right.  Stephen Lynch, Lullaby.  Yes.  This wraps up this little segment.  Naked Girls Outside the Studio.  We got the audio from the executions down there in, where was that?  Georgia.  Georgia, right?  I want to hear that. 
[01:53:30]  It's really interesting stuff.  Stick around.  I'm not here.  Psycho Mark is not in the building.  I'm not here.  I'm not here.  I'm supposed to be a fucker.  It's kind of a special song.  It's not on the CD because it sucks?  You just want it.  That would seem to follow, wouldn't it?  No, it's actually not a very funny song.  It's, uh, if you don't mind, my wife and I were recently divorced. 
[01:54:00]  You're 12.  I know.  You're 12.  Short marriage.  Okay.  Okay.  How old are you?  I'm 27.  27?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, my wife of 16 years, Erin, got divorced recently, and we have a little six-year-old  girl, and, uh, she doesn't really understand why Mommy isn't living with us anymore, and  I did my best to write this little lullaby and perhaps explain it to her.  I liked this set up.  It was great.  Thanks.  Okay.  Let me bring it down a little bit here. 
[01:54:30]  Here you are.  Hush, little girl, sweet, sweet baby, don't cry tonight.  Daddy's here, and he'll sing you a soft lullaby tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before? 
[01:55:00]  How can I explain why Mommy's not here anymore?  Cause Daddy likes porno and ten-dollar whores.  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores.  Daddy likes robbing against little boys on the bus. 
[01:55:30]  I think that's why your Mommy loves love.  Pretty.  Morning.  Hush, little girl.  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke.  Daddy just wants to forget. 
[01:56:00]  The mic.  The mic.  Soon it will all be like it was before.  Any minute she will walk through that front door.  But Daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer.  Then he wants sex that involves Mommy's rear. 
[01:56:30]  Daddy has sores on his genitals oozing with pus.  I think that's why your Mommy left out.  Please don't cry.  Please don't cry.  I swear I'll try.  To be here by your side. 
[01:57:00]  Right after Daddy gets home from the bar.  He visits his boogie and steals a new car.  He'll drive to the strip club.  And if Daddy plays his card track.  He'll bring home your new Mommy tonight.  Daddy day.  Daddy day.  Daddy day.  Daddy day.  Daddy day.  Daddy day.  Lady day.  Daddy day. 
[01:57:30]  Lady day.  Daddy-di-di-di.  Daddy.  Lady day.  Lady day.  Day.  Day.  Oh, look at me.  I'm making.  Look at me.  I'm all teared up now.  I'm welling up with tears.  Hey, even Dice is tearing up over there.  Yeah, you got me, huh?  Oh, you got my sensitive side.  Kid.  Jack is.  Who cares?  We can't play chocolate salty balls anymore.  We got some new songs. 
[01:58:00]  That's Stephen Lynch.  This dude is called Half a Man.  You can order it by emailing him at pusshead at AOL.com.  Marketing's really taking off, isn't it?  That's not my forte.  And it's pusshead, P-U-S, not pusshead, which is P-U-S-S, obviously.  What did everybody do before the Internet?  Like, you know, send me a postcard or something.

Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  1027 WNEW.  Opa, instant feedback.  Hey, Ant, you used the race car analogy a few months ago.  Remember that?  I said, let's say a race car driver's racing around the track, stops, girl gets in the car,  does nothing, just in the passenger seat.  And the race car driver's driving around, racing, racing, driving around the car. 
[01:59:00]  Takes the checkered flag.  Wins the money.  Where would this bitch get off saying she earned some of the winning purse?  Right?  Remember that analogy?  I completely remember, like it was yesterday.  Well, this feedback.  Hey, Ant, you used the race car analogy a few months.  How do you like my solution to divorce?  And that's from Dale Earnhardt.  Checking in on instant feedback.  John, what's going on? 
[01:59:30]  Hey, quick question, Anthony.  You know why most husbands die before their wives?  Why?  They want to.  Very good, John.  Ouch.  And other people are getting confused.  I'm not talking about child support.  I don't have kids.  I don't want kids.  And if you got to go to court and you're bitching and complaining about child support,  that's a whole other animal.  You know, kids can't do anything about it.  They're kids.  They can't go out and get a job.  I'm just talking about divorce with no kids.  So if you're getting screwed child support, go after yourself. 
[02:00:00]  I don't care.  You decided to have the kids, not me.  Your case is about nothing.  Yeah.  Right.  Thank you.  Absolutely right.  Anthony has nothing.  I've had nothing.  I have nothing.  I went through my entire marriage with nothing.  You've been separated over a year.  You still have nothing.  Nothing.  A year and a half, I think it's been.  Jesus Christ.  It's about nothing.  Hey, it's a divorce case about nothing.  Right.  Boom.  Boom.

[02:03:00]  We're sacrificing for our listeners right now.  Yeah, I know.  Like, there's a party going on right outside that door.  We could be out there enjoying the festivities and giving you really bad radio.  Or we could...  Yeah, exactly.  Or we could be in the studio behind closed doors and concentrating on what the hell we're doing.  And look at the pictures later, just like the listeners.  That's right.  Girls are showing up like crazy, though.  There has to be at least 10 girls trying to qualify for the trip to Hawaii today, Anthony.  Coming in under the wire.  Why aren't any more pictures up, though? 
[02:03:30]  Scott's working on it.  It's going to be a while.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It takes time.  Uh-oh.  What's the matter?  Hmm.  I asked Kelly.  Yeah.  Thanks, Kelly.  Um, I need to like some yogurt.  My blood sugar level's dropping drastically.  So I go, Kelly, could you get me yogurt out of the fridge? 
[02:04:00]  Ooh.  She came back with two.  Now, the problem is, one is really fresh.  Yeah.  And the other one has been in the fridge probably six to eight months.  Because we never take anything out of the fridge.  So now I have to decide which one is the fresh one.  Put it down when it walks away.  You may say, well, just look for the expiration date.  I can't.  There's no expiration dates on either one of them.  Great.  Oh, and I'm dying. 
[02:04:30]  My blood sugar level is dropping.  Do I go with the strawberry yogurt or the peach yogurt?  Botulism at its finest.  This is a great new game, man.  Yeah, let's see.  Kelly, do you remember which one was on the door?  Peach?  Peach.  The peach was on the door?  Yeah.  Oh, man, because I was going to go for strawberry.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  The strawberry one says, like, on the bottom it says April 24th.  I don't know if that's...  April 23rd.  That means this one's over a year old, then. 
[02:05:00]  Seriously.  Yeah, you could look at the top of that one.  All right, wait.  Look at the nuts that you put in there.  Right?  They look a little dry and nasty as opposed to the other ones.  Hey, look at that.  Yeah, because I'm going with the crunch yogurt where they have the nuts on top.  Yeah.  Now that I look closely, the nuts on this yogurt, Anthony, has some fuzz on it.  And the aspiration date is April 23rd, so that yogurt's over a year old, I believe. 
[02:05:30]  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Because this could be really, really bad.  No.  The peach was definitely on the door?  Yeah.  All right.  The strawberry was on the top of the dinner.  Thank you, Kelly.  The lovely and talented Kelly.  I got that, you sick ass.  Yeah.  Okay.  Where were we?  Girls getting naked.  Pictures will be up on the website very soon.  Yogurt rushing.  Someone's saying yogurt can't go bad. 
[02:06:00]  It's over a year old.  Oh, yes, it can.  Liz.  Liz.  It can't go bad.  It's a live enzyme.  It could still go bad.  It can.  Yogurt culture is a live enzyme.  It's just like, it's mitosis, like cells over and over again.  It can't go bad.  It can't spoil.  Is that what you tell the guys when something funny is going on?  It can't go bad.  Okay.  See, that's not nice.  I was going to come in tomorrow.  Okay.  Oh, so why do you have to refrigerate it?  Yeah.  Look at my throat completely. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  I'm stumped.  I don't know.  Thank you, Mark, who's not here, who's not here because he's at Fox working,  just walked into the Jaymore suite with some girl.  Oh, yeah?  Naked.  Trying to help her out with the whiskey.  Liz, thank you, and I hope you come down tomorrow.  No, I definitely am coming down.  I'm just joking, because tomorrow's the last day to qualify for the whiskey and whiskey  contest.  Could you ask me to put me back on hold so I could get directions?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  No problem.  All right.  Thanks.  Okay.  Of course, trip to Hawaii, Anthony.  Tomorrow's the last day.  Yes.  We can't stretch this contest anymore, so come down tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  All right? 
[02:07:00]  Come on down.  All right.  Where were we?  Oh, you want to do the audio?  Yeah, I've been wanting to hear this.  I haven't heard this yet.  I'm hearing all the stories about this execution audio.  Down in Georgia, they got some audio of a guy being put to death or something.  A bunch of them.  Yeah, lots and lots of them.  I guess they...  I don't even know why they were taping.  I guess so they made sure...  Because it's fun down there.  So they made sure the execution went okay?  Yeah, I guess so.  I don't know.  And the lawyer was building a case or something and came upon all these cassettes of people... 
[02:07:30]  Right?  Do I have the story kind of right?  I'm not exactly sure on the court side of it, but this is because, I guess, for every  execution, they need to be talking to each other, and they record it just in case something  happens down the road.  Who needs to be...  The jail, the prison, the warden.  Oh, they're all linked up?  Yeah, just so they can't be accused of anything inappropriate.  You know what's weird, listening to this audio of an execution going down?  Yeah.  It sounds like you're listening to, like, NASA. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, like a space launch or something, huh?  A space launch or they're doing something in space, and they're just kind of talking  everyone through it.  I've just read about it.  I haven't heard this yet.  All right, well, we can play.  But I heard you don't hear the guy crisping away or anything.  No, but you just kind of hear the people that are responsible for killing this guy, and  they're just monotone and, like...  The killing machine in action.  Yeah, there's no real emotion in these people's voices.  Great.  I love it.  I'll tell you the truth.  I love it.  Because no one was there in a monotone voice describing how horribly the people died 
[02:08:30]  that these people were being put to death for.  So I love it.  It should be worse.  You know what really bothers me, and that's probably a sensitive subject for a lot of Catholics  out there, the Pope trying to convince the President not to kill Timothy McVeigh.  Oh, please.  You know, first of all, the Pope is...  How many hundreds of years has the Pope been powerless?  The Pope can't do anything.  He used to have some juice years ago, the Pope. 
[02:09:00]  Well, when you're not anymore.  Well, when you're just a few removed from the man that's doing all the miracles, you  know, people are going to, you know, sit up and listen.  The Pope ain't got the people's ear no more.  There ain't no crusades going on or anything anymore.  Now it's just, he's this old guy that no one listens to, but everyone goes, I think we  should listen to what the Pope says.  No one listens to the Pope?  As a non-practicing Catholic, though, it deeply disturbs me that he, well, I guess 
[02:09:30]  he has to take that stance, but that every life is precious.  That he doesn't think Timothy McVeigh should die for his crimes.  Holy ass.  Even the life that ran down your hand as you were watching the WNEW website for the whipped  cream bikini contest, he even sees that as being precious life.  The stains in your sheets are precious life.  He's the Pope.  What is he?  He doesn't even know where he is.  And saying Timothy McVeigh shouldn't be put to death.  The only reason I, for a second, think he shouldn't is because he wants to so bad. 
[02:10:00]  The guy's not fighting it or anything, and that pisses me off.  You want him going kicking and screaming.  If only they bolted him in that chair or hung him or shot him.  It's going to be wonderful for him.  He's going to go into dreamy land.  Pow.  Over.  He fell asleep.  More girls signing out there, filling out the releases.  Yeah.  Wow.  It came out of nowhere today.  Yeah.  Big rally today.  We're going to have at least 10 or 12 brand new girls. 
[02:10:30]  10 or 12?  Ed, you haven't...  No, I can't see from there.  I know.  We've got to redesign the studio so you can see what I see.  It's really nice sometimes when we're doing a really boring break.  And I'll look to my left and all of a sudden you see some piece of ass walking down the  hall.  We need a closed circuit TV with a screen right here so I can just watch what's going  on out there.  I don't even want to get into the Pope thing.  I'm just throwing something out there that bothers me, and I don't feel like arguing it.  Religion is a farce.  I have a theory.  I don't even want...  A religious theory.  Let's talk about religious theory right now. 
[02:11:00]  No, I just threw something out there.  I don't care if you agree with me or disagree.  I just...  It was just something that just bothered me.  The Pope's a dope.  And it rhymes.  Hey, who does that guy look like?  The old rap star with the wacky...  That's a chick.  That's a chick.  Oh, my God.  Who is that?  I don't know.  I just said, what does that guy look like?  Who was the rap star in the 80s that looked like that?  Melly Mel?  That looks like Busta Rhymes.  Well, yeah, the Busta Rhymes hair, but someone had the Busta Rhymes hair before Busta Rhymes 
[02:11:30]  did.  Never mind.  I'm really distracted today.  What?  What happened?  Okay, you want to hear the audio, Anthony?  Yeah, let's hear what goes on when somebody gets the electric chair is how this guy was  dying, right?  Okay.  Hey, Earl.  Yo.  Who does she look like?  Old rap star that used to have the hair like that.  Kid and Play or not Kid and Play, though?  Help me out.  Mony Love?  What?  Mony Love.  Mony Love.  Um, I was... 
[02:12:00]  5-5 Freddy?  Oh, God.  Um, I know the name off the top of my head.  I'm killing it.  I just drug a blank.  All right.  Sorry.  Thanks, Earl.  You're always a big help.  He's a rock guy.  He's not a rap guy.  Oh, that's right.  Rock.  Of course.  All right.  Here's the audio, Anthony.  All right.  This is a recording of the execution of Ivan Ray Stanley, EF-103-603, July the 12th, 1984. 
[02:12:30]  Colonel Lowe, Mickey?  Yes.  The witnesses are now entering the witness room.  Okay.  The state witnesses have entered the witness room and have seated themselves on the front row.  At this time, the news media witnesses are entering.  All witnesses have arrived and have seated.  Let's proceed. 
[02:13:00]  We can see if you're ready.  Colonel Lowe, Mickey, the warden has entered the execution chamber at this time, approaching the microphone,  and is in the process of briefing all witnesses to remain quiet and to avoid any unnecessary movement.  He is also advising them that medical assistance is available if needed.  Hi, this is the warden.  I don't want you playing any odd tapes and no Mets tapes, neither. 
[02:13:30]  Or else I'll have to, don't just stare at it, hate it.  That guy sounds like one of those southern prison guys that kind of enjoys it.  I was going to say, he kind of enjoys it, right.  Get in the chair, boy.  He's like to put this tape home and whack to it.  Yeah.  Get in the chair, boy.  The warden at this time is in the process of confirming all witnesses. 
[02:14:00]  All witnesses have been confirmed.  The warden is in the process of advising all witnesses that we will now proceed with the court-ordered execution of Ivan Stanley.  Are you ready to laugh?  The superintendent has afforded a condemnment opportunity to make a last statement.  He has declined to make a last statement.  Are you ready to tell him that?  He has afforded the opportunity for prayer. 
[02:14:30]  He declined this also.  The warden is now in the process of reading the essential court order to the witnesses and to the condemned.  The warden at this time is in the process of reading the court order to the condemned.  The warden at this time is in the process of reading the court order to the condemned. 
[02:15:00]  This time the superintendent has completed the essential court order.  The leg band has been secured to the condemned's right leg.  And also the headset has been secured to his head.  The headset.  The headset.  This is sick, man.  Let's take off our headset.  This is...  It's like a mic.  It's got a sign, Fry that Effler.  I'm good.  Perspiration is now being wiped from the forehead of the condemned. 
[02:15:30]  Probably a lot of that.  He is secure and ready for execution with the exception of the hood being placed over his head  and the wires being attached to the leg band and to the headset.  Nicky, the wires have been attached and secured to the headset and to the leg band.  The perspiration has been wiped again from the condemned's forehead  and the hood is being placed on at this time.  The face hood has been secured.  All the warden and all execution team members have departed the execution chamber. 
[02:16:00]  He's so monotone.  And there he is, the guy sitting there now just waiting for the jolt to go through him.  That'll take him to hell.  The old Sparky, riding old Sparky to hell.  Where's the people that he killed?  I'd love to know what this guy did.  Stand by for the warden's last telephone check.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine?  You're the guy just praying for a miracle?  Praying for the miracle. 
[02:16:30]  All right, here we go.  We'll see if there's anyone going to call at the last minute to save my ass.  You have nine voicemails.  Right.  Sir, hi, baby.  Cook some chicken tonight.  As the clock's ticking away, this guy says it.  Beep.  Hey, Billy Bob, I just want to know if you want to go fishing this weekend.  All right, give me a call.  You know, I'm going to pick up that pickup truck.  I want you to tell me if that engine's okay.  Beep.  Hi, this is Dennis.  Remember, you got an apartment tomorrow. 
[02:17:00]  As the guy's waiting for the governor to call or something.  Oh, that's twisted.  Can you imagine?  Whew.  So here he is.  He's ready to get it.  Everything's hooked up.  He's in the chair.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Ralph, this is Commissioner.  Yes.  There are no sayings.  You can proceed to carry out the official order of the court.  Very well.  On my count of three, I'll press your button.  One, two, three, two. 
[02:17:30]  Colonel Lowell.  Yes.  Nicky.  Execution is now in progress.  When his first foot surge entered his body, he stiffened and I heard a pop as if one of  the straps broke, but I can't tell from this vantage point.  He is still at this time sitting there with clenched fists with no other movement.  He is slowly relaxing at this time. 
[02:18:00]  The first phase of the execution is completed.  We are now into the second phase.  The hell's the second phase?  The second phase?  The first one's zapping him with a few million volts.  You know, this is the first time I'm hearing this, Anthony.  I just got goosebumps.  Isn't that sick?  Like, you totally picture it in your head.  The guy's sipping it up.  No, it freaks me out.  There's no emotion in this guy's voice.  You don't care.  But you have to have some emotion.  You're a human being. 
[02:18:30]  What?  What's up, Mike?  You ever see the Faces of Death video where they show the guy getting electrocuted?  I ain't buying anything off of Faces of Death.  I don't believe it.  Yeah, we think a lot of that stuff is fake.  I know there might have been one filmed execution from the 30s, maybe.  But anything after that, no.  The video of the woman from, like, I'm not even sure what it is.  Yeah, all right.  But anything else?  You've seen any color films of executions?  It ain't it.  Right.  All right, second phase. 
[02:19:00]  The second phase is completed at this time.  We're now to the third and final stage.  From my vantage point, it seems that the inmate has relaxed somewhat.  But his fists are still clenched, but there's no movement from the condemned.  There's still no movement from the individual.  He's still just sitting there.  His third phase is completed.  We're still into the third phase. 
[02:19:30]  You sounded surprised.  He's still just sitting there, lazy son-bitch.  I want to know what the third phase is, though.  Yeah.  Do they take a stick and poke him to see if he's going to move?  Yeah, give him a little poke or something.  Third phase, and the execution is completed.  We're now into the five minutes lap time.  It appeared when the execution was completed and the power was on, he relaxed somewhat more than he was. 
[02:20:00]  It was pretty visible that he relaxed even more than what he'd seen before.  Any reaction from the witnesses?  They're sitting very still, just observing.  No, I'd say one or two of the media writing notes, taking notes, but other than that, they're just sitting staring into the execution chamber.  Hello, Mickey.  We have now completed two minutes of the five minutes lap time.  Bobby.  Bobby Volz from Hobart.  Next, where we enter the watering hole for the drinking phase, followed by the sleep with your daughter phase. 
[02:20:30]  Funny Bobby.  There's still no, very little movement from any of the witnesses.  No one even taking notes at this time.  They're just sitting there staring into the execution chamber.  Note yourself.  Stay out of electric chamber.  We've got a few more seconds.  Colonel Lowe, Mickey, we have now completed five minutes lap time. 
[02:21:00]  Stand by for the doctors are now preparing to enter the execution chamber to check for life signs.  The first physician has completed his examination.  The second is now in the process of making his check.  The second doctor has now completed his examination.  The third and final doctor is in the process of making his check.  The examination is completed. 
[02:21:30]  Stand by for the superintendent's time of death and confirmation of death.  This effort is dead.  You're pretty confident he's dead.  The superintendent has advised all witnesses that death did occur at 1224, this date.  He has instructed all witnesses to depart the witness room and to be transported back to the front of the institution. 
[02:22:00]  Curtains are drawn at this time.  Colonel Lowe, Mickey, yes.  That completes it.  Curtains are drawn.  Marble, see if you can find what that snap popped that you were talking about a while ago.  I think it was just the electricity arc.  I don't think any strap broke anything.  He just jerked real hard and caused the electricity to arc.  The electrician is now in the process of taking the wire from the headset. 
[02:22:30]  They have removed the hood, the face hood, and are in the process now of taking or removing the headset.  The headset has been removed.  The electrician is now in the process of removing the electrical wire from the leg band.  The electrical wire has been removed from the condemned's right leg.  He has been removed from the electric chair at this time and being placed on the stretcher. 
[02:23:00]  He is being removed from the execution chamber at this time,  and the execution team members are taking him to the autopsy route.  That's all I can see, Colonel Lowe.  Is the warden available?  Just a minute.  You feel it?  Then your staff did an excellent job.  We appreciate it very much.  Okay.  That's a little bit of a scare.  I don't know if they related it to you or not. 
[02:23:30]  The poppin's out.  Yeah.  We were thinking that what happens, because he sat there for that three minutes,  his water and the sponge on his leg ran out right there by his foot.  And we're thinking that that's just like a little bowl of lightning.  Did you see anything?  No.  They said Colonel Hargerson and other people in the witness room said they didn't see anything like that.  I still feel good about it, really. 
[02:24:00]  It ran too smooth, Ralph, but don't screw it up next time.  Okay.  Oh, they're laughing.  God damn.  Sounded just like a space shuttle on.  Yeah.  He said throttle up.  Good job, everybody.  All right.  That's the condemned.  That's twisted.  That's something, man.  There you go.  I would love to see that, though.  I'd love to see him just get jolted.  Right.  All right.  We have another piece of audio where the execution went horribly wrong. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  It's a lot shorter.  We'll do that after we take a quick break.  Nicky Sterling's pictures are up.  Oh, they are.  And, yeah, there is something wrong with the camera.  Let me see.  It's so much hotter than that.  Let me see.  There's a couple good ones, though.  I don't know what Rick's doing.  I mean, something's going on, man.  This is really good.  The second one's really good.  Whoa.  And some of the pictures are skins, like, a red tone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the lighting.  Like, the close-up, you see, it's more of a natural color. 
[02:25:00]  Right.  And then when he pulls back, it's red.  Right.  I mean, that's why when people go to professional photo shoots, there's lighting and really good lenses.  He's using a friggin' digital piece of crap camera.  Well, we got, like, I don't know.  There's so many girls outside, it's not even funny.  And we're going to, you know, get all their pictures up in the next couple of hours on  WNEW.com.  Last day to qualify for the trip to Hawaii whipped cream bikini contest tomorrow, ladies. 
[02:25:30]  So come on down, okay?  Yeah.  Quick break, and we'll play that other piece of audio, Ant.  Sure.  That was quite interesting.  Yeah.  It was cool.  O.P. Anthony.  This is a God-given talent to be this stupid and this funny and this filthy.  1, 2, 7, 4, WNEW.  Hey, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  That's right.

[02:30:00]  It's about as funny as a stinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chucks.  Oh, great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and they're my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Hopefully you got a damn something.  What a couple of ass wipes.  1027.  WNW.  A little taste for the Beastie Boys.  I want a few seven WNW.  Yeah.  Hey, Bonnie.  What's up?  I just want to make you feel better, Opie.  The Bible says, give unto Caesar what is due unto Caesar. 
[02:30:30]  So it's okay to kill, you know, these people.  And I think it's wrong that the Pope is trying to just save one person.  He should be trying to save the law.  You know, change the law rather than...  That's what the Bible says.  All right, Bonnie.  Thank you.  All right.  Cool.  Didn't make you feel better, did it?  No, I don't want to get into an argument about the death penalty.  Timothy McVeigh is going to be put to death very soon, and all these idiots out there, 
[02:31:00]  you know, trying to protest and say he doesn't deserve to die.  They're just insane at this point.  Well, yeah, but...  There are times when you have to kind of give a little on your cause and realize, well,  there's a common ground every once in a while.  Yeah.  You know what happened to me the other day?  I'm on a plane.  The Pope is sitting next to me, right?  He's doing a crossword puzzle.  And he asked me, he leans over, he goes, hey, I need a word for a woman.  Four-letter word.  Ends with U-N-T.  Oh, you're terrible.  So I look at him, I go, because it's the Pope, I say, Ant. 
[02:31:30]  He goes, oh, damn, could I have an eraser?  Pope wrote the C word, ma'am.  Pope wrote the C word.  Sir.  Oh, I can't help you there.  That's an Otto and George original.  Of course it is.  Very good.  All right, Bonnie, thank you.  All right, bye.  All right, we have the other audio, Anthony, of someone being put to death in Georgia.  I love this.  They ought to telecast.  I think we're getting close to it.  Remember when the condom ads weren't on TV and bra ads, and it was a huge thing when 
[02:32:00]  they finally put one on, and now it's just commonplace.  You see half-naked girls on these Victoria's Secret ads and stuff, and it's great.  And the condom ads are on, and no one cares.  It's not a big deal.  I think eventually we're going to get to the point where executions might just get on  television.  And it would just, what a day.  Imagine sitting with your friends.  You're like the Super Bowl or something.  Or a Tyson fight.  You know, you just hang out.  Hey, I'm going to check it out. 
[02:32:30]  Watching the execution.  I think everyone's going to be let down.  I think it's going to be a disappointment.  Well, yeah.  They're finally going to be lethal.  Let's say, fast forward 25 years, how we work around here.  And they put the, yeah, live executions on pay-per-view and stuff, and you sit around  like it's the final episode of Survivor, and you have your popcorn.  Yeah.  And you dress up as your favorite serial killer or whatever you're going to do for the theme  party.  Dress up like the accused.  Or whatever, right?  And then they're going to, you know, they'll kill the guy on pay-per-view, and everyone  around the room is just going to go, oh, he went to sleep. 
[02:33:00]  That's it.  That's it.  I spent $89.95 on this.  Wouldn't it be great with like Fox TV graphics, though?  They could have the little, like the heartbeat going in the corner and the stats.  Fox, all that kind of stuff.  Well, Fox would take it.  The big graphic in the corner, like for baseball, with a coom, coom, coom.  Yeah, yeah.  Like all the stats come out of a little thing.  I would love that.  See, but Fox would take it to that next level.  All right.  So now we fast forward a while, and now executions have been on pay-per-view and stuff for the 
[02:33:30]  past 10 years or so.  Fox will come out with the show.  Yeah.  When executions go bad.  Now, that would rock.  That would rock.  The guy kind of freaking out.  But the lethal injection blows.  You know, when they were riding old Sparky.  Now, that's a way to put someone to death.  But, yeah, I think we'd be bored watching the lethal.  Maybe they'd bring it back.  Because occasionally, some wacko in one of those states that still have other ways of killing  people, say, oh, I want to be hanged.  I want the firing squad.  That'd be entertaining. 
[02:34:00]  That'd watch.  All right.  So you want to get this audio on the air?  Yeah.  What is this one?  One that went wrong?  Yeah.  This one went a little wrong.  Went a little bad?  Houston, we have a problem.  Nothing better.  Well, they sound like NASA, so.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Commissioner.  Carry out the execution by the order of the court.  There's no reason to delay.  Very well.  I'm left out of three.  Pass your button.  One, two, three.  The execution now has begun. 
[02:34:30]  There was one small jerk from the condemned at the time the execution was initiated.  He is setting very still now.  And we are also now into the second phase of the execution.  We are now into the third phase of the execution.  No movement from the condemned.  No activity or no movement from the witnesses.  He appears to be relaxing a little bit more now. 
[02:35:00]  There's 60 seconds remaining on the third phase of the execution.  There's a slight movement from the condemned's head.  He seems to be moving his head from side to side slightly.  Uh-oh.  I feel the time is 12-19.  Commissioner.  He is still moving his head, and he seems to have slumped down in a relaxing tight position in the chair.  I couldn't say him.  He's moving his head. 
[02:35:30]  I think he's trying to scream.  Commissioner.  Commissioner, what the hell do we do now?  What happened?  You get your gun, Commissioner, and just shoot this son of a bitch.  I'm Buford T. Justice.  His head is moving from side to side slightly.  Does anyone have a hammer?  We'll just crack him on the noggin.  Where's Gallagher's mallet when you need it? 
[02:36:00]  Commissioner, Mr. Long, the execution is completed at this time.  The electrical panel box is secured and locked.  I do not detect any movement from the condemned at this time.  He seems to have stopped moving his head and also his arms.  That's over time at 12-20.  You are in the last time countdown, is that correct?  Yes, sir.  We're into the first minute of the last time now. 
[02:36:30]  No movement from any of the witnesses, and at this time, no movement from the condemned.  We have now completed one minute of last time, four minutes remaining.  Two minutes of last time completed at this time, three minutes remaining.  Still, there is little movement from any of the witnesses, and I detect no movement from the condemned at this time.  I showed the time at 12-22. 
[02:37:00]  Commissioner?  Yes.  Mr. Long, there is a slight movement.  He's still moving his head slightly.  He's moving his head slightly.  It's funny because I don't know him.  His middle finger's coming up.  Wow, it sucks to be you.  Boy, what a powerhouse that guy is, though, huh?  Man.  I could take it.  Come on, I'm not a pussy.  Give me more voltage.  Take what you got. 
[02:37:30]  The only thing we can do is continue until his physicians can check him after the last time has expired.  Don't worry, bring your checklist.  Okay.  Okay, we have completed three minutes of last time.  Two minutes remaining.  Commissioner, Mr. Long?  Yes.  He is still moving his head slightly.  Kind of a bobbing, up and down moving. 
[02:38:00]  Commissioner?  Yes.  Mr. Long, we have completed four minutes of last time.  We have one minute remaining.  And from my vantage point, I do detect, or it seems to be, that he is breathing.  Commissioner, Mr. Long, we have completed the five minutes last time.  Stand by for the physicians, check.  Commissioner?  Yes.  It appears the doctors agree with it that he's still breathing.  Do you want us to check him and then go through it again, or just go ahead and go through it again? 
[02:38:30]  Check him and then go through it again.  Definitely check him.  Don't bear it from the checklist.  All right.  Have them check him.  Okay.  Really?  I can't find it.  We've announced that we're going to do it again.  Uh-uh.  It doesn't say so.  Okay.  It remains on.  Okay.  Good.  Uh-uh.  12-26, 30 seconds.  And that's all we have with that one, unfortunately.  Mr. Commissioner Bob Murphy here. 
[02:39:00]  He's dead.  We've given him the appropriate time of high voltage, and he is indeed dead.  Oh, wait.  He's moving.  Oh, wait.  I've strapped Mickey in the seat.  And the commissioner.  He's dead.  Absolutely.  Mr. Commissioner, we're five minutes into the elapsed time, and he's dead.  Oh, wait a minute.  He's waving.  When we haven't even started the execution, doesn't he look a lot like Benny Agba, Annie? 
[02:39:30]  Now, that would rock.  Bob Murphy here is your execution.  What a beautiful day for an execution.  And as the elapsed time runs out, we see there's absolutely no movement.  None whatsoever.  He's completely dead here in the death chamber. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  No, he's alive.  Wait, I'm at the Met game.  I'm at the Met game.  That was a home run?  Wait, he caught it?  Where the hell am I?  Very nice.  That new little Jap sure can run for the best, can't he?  You see him fielding last night?  Jesus Christ, he's running around like a pachinko ball going through the pachinko machine.  All over the place.  You never knew where he was going to end up. 
[02:40:30]  I said, what?  You see that little guy?  He rolled.  He damn near climbed the back wall and jumped out just to get the ball.  Look at that little Jap go.  But I did it right the first time.  Yeah, right.  He did, Mickey.  What?  He's alive?  I did it right the first time.  Green pea.  The Orson Welles.  But I did it right the first time.  That's great. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  There is a little botched job.  And he had to sit there and wait the five minutes.  I don't know what that was.  Probably just like nerves.  Guy's just kind of moving his head.  Noelle.  I'm hungover.  That must have hurt, though, huh?  Ouch.  Yeah, ouch.  Okay.  Noelle.  Yes?  Oh, from the best boob contest.  How you doing?  The one with the huge hooters.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, we remember you.  You're coming down tomorrow for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yes, I'm coming.  Is tomorrow the last day? 
[02:41:30]  Tomorrow's the last day to qualify, and then we'll start the voting Monday.  Okay.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing great.  A lot of lovely ladies down here today.  I know.  I just saw the website.  Very nice.  All right.  Cool.  Well, we'll see you tomorrow, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Do any of these ladies need plugs or anything, or are they all set?  I didn't hear it like that, man.  I know.  I know one of the girls is dancing at Double D's.  I promised she would get a, you know.  Double D!  A plug-in. 
[02:42:00]  Bobby!  What's going on, fellas?  How are you, Bobby?  You guys playing good for what I learned?  Yeah, we can start that, I guess.  I learned that the new Wolf of Ball bat record is seven inches and proud.  Yes.  And I learned another thing.  Yeah.  That Mike and the Mad Dog effing suck.  They're a bunch of pussies.  Well, because they spend too much time on one subject.  Yeah.  They need to get a life.  I gave them a free programming tip today.  Yeah, they might need to use it.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Well, they spent like three and a half days on that stupid Billy Crystal movie, 
[02:42:30]  which was really good, by the way, but they discussed it for three and a half days.  You get nothing, you lose.  Good day, sir.  You should do a program tip of the day.  Psycho Mark, who's supposedly not here, has something to say.  Yes?  Yes, Mark?  You should do a program tip of the day for the boys.  We had a couple of radio pointers today.  Anthony watches one Mets game, and now he's Mel Allen.  Shut up.  You know, I watch the Mets.  I watch them. 
[02:43:00]  Girlfriend's a Mets fan, so I sit and I watch the Mets games,  and I enjoy when they put all their hope in Piazza, and he screws up.  What do you got in your mouth there, Psycho Mark?  We stopped doing whippets.  We need to whippets.  Oh, no.  Good morning.  Hey, the guys that got wow on TRL are here.  Oh, they are?  Yeah.  What's your name again, and you're going to be at Double D's?  Yeah, Laura.  Laura.  Laura M.  Laura M, the hot blonde.  Yes. 
[02:43:30]  You'll be able to see your pictures on WNAW.com.  Are your pictures up yet?  They should be.  They should be, and then you can go see your dance at Double D's.  Cool.  Are you happy with your pictures?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I am.  Okay.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  What's going on?  Hey.  What's your name?  Jay.  Hey, Jay.  I got the wow on TRL.  Do you have the wow sign?  Yeah, I got the shirt, and I got the tape on me.  Oh, look at that.  All right, I believe you.  I was just asking.  Oh, no.  We totally appreciate you supporting the show by doing that.  Yeah, I came pretty close to getting kicked out, screaming FBA when the crowd would get 
[02:44:00]  quiet.  FBA.  Yeah, they're telling everyone to get quiet, and all you hear is FBA.  No, it's TRL.  Wait, were you inside or outside?  I was inside.  Oh, you were inside?  I was inside in the audience.  Nice.  It was a school field trip.  Yeah, everyone.  Actually, my teacher's listening right now.  Cool.  Everyone was calling, saying, oh, my God, this guy got wow on TV today.  TRL.  Good job.  And you're screaming the FBA.  We would have been here earlier.  Nice.  We were going to bring a girl for whipped cream bikini, but her boyfriend yelled at me. 
[02:44:30]  How old are you?  18.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She's 18, too.  All right.  I'm with my friend, and she would have been a finalist, but boyfriend's a...  Yeah, I really care about that, but we've got naked girls in the studio, so thank you  for getting wowed with me.  Great job.  Thank you.  No, thank you.  We're going to give you some stuff, too, so stick around, all right?  All right, cool, yeah.  Then hook him up with something, okay?  All right.  One of our valuable parting gifts.  Yes, Rick?  Hey.  This is Emelisa.  Emelisa?  Hi. 
[02:45:00]  Emelisa.  Hi.  Wait, is your...  Emelisa?  Was Mom confused when she was naming you?  Emma or Lisa?  Do you know what she's...  My name's Brandon.  Name the pick?  There's no other person in the world who has my name.  I'm bringing that up.  Well, I would...  Slow down.  I think there's probably somewhere someone named that.  That's the first Emelisa I've ever heard of.  So she might be off or something.  All right.  Let me see if you want to...  Yeah, okay.  I try to be polite about this every time.  Because you're just like, let me see...  Oh, well, well.  Well, hey, maybe... 
[02:45:30]  How do I say this tactfully?  It's like, maybe we should spend 30 seconds talking to the contestant before we see her  naked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you're doing the whipped cream bikini thing?  Yeah.  Very good.  Did she do it already?  Nice.  Oh, wow.  Nice, huh?  Rick got plenty of ass shots.  He likes the ass.  She came in.  She goes, oh, no, I've got some shots, some poses I've been practicing all week.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Someone practicing for the contest.  Look at that.  Very good.  She goes, I've got two ass shots I definitely want to do. 
[02:46:00]  I have this shot.  Wow.  Nice.  Are her pictures up yet?  No, I just took them there in the camera.  Emily, can we see what Rick was looking at there?  Oh, there you go.  Look at that.  I didn't expect that.  What are you pointing at?  The dumper.  The butter.  The dumper.  Gelman.  Yeah, we'll check out the dumper, sure.  She's got like something.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, look at that.  Do you dance or anything?  No.  I go out dancing with my girlfriend. 
[02:46:30]  You want to be in a movie?  I'm not just saying.  I never want to be in a movie, of course.  Well, we're casting for Slap Happy Volume 8.  Slap Happy.  Probably the most offensive, disgusting movie I've ever seen.  Can you vomit?  It's a prerequisite for this movie.  Yeah, some girls don't have that reflex.  Yeah, you need a good gag reflex and you've got to be able to take a punch.  Much like all of Mike Tyson's dates, pretty much. 
[02:47:00]  Well, that is a very nice body.  Thank you.  Yes.  That's good.  Why are you nervous?  Why are you nervous?  It was the first time I've ever done something like that.  Wow, how do you stand up on those things?  Those are some tiny little pads you got there.  What you got?  Well, I'm pretty short.  You are?  We didn't notice.  I didn't notice.  You are really small.  How tall a gal are you?  Five feet.  Five feet, that's it?  Five feet.  Yeah.  But that's okay because, you know, I'm proportionate.  It's got nice big round boobies, big round eyes. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, you got the nice big round boobies.  Of course.  It's got the Jennifer Lopez voice.  I'm 100% natural.  There's nothing to say on this.  Thank you.  It's the J-Lo voice now and not the Rosie Perez voice.  We've moved on.  Yeah, it's more J-Lo than Rosie Perez.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Rosie voice is really annoying.  Yeah, it's very, it's very, uh, the J-Lo trying to reach out and say, look, I am Hispanic.  You know, because she really doesn't come across like that.  And so you got a big ass.  So your ass is proportioned to you. 
[02:48:00]  What?  Oh, look at, oh, a little healthy competition in asses there.  One girl felt like we weren't paying too much attention to her, so she decided to show us her ass.  Say something, say something hot in Spanish like you would say to your, uh, boyfriend during most intimate of moments.  Hey, papi.  Oh.  That's what I, one of the girls at the tunnel told me when I was driving in.  Hey, papi.  That'd be better than, yeah, just a little more.  A little more, a little more.  Dame, papi, dame. 
[02:48:30]  Dame, dame, dame.  Oh, yeah?  Muy, muy.  It's English.  That means, give me my child support.  Oh, sorry.  I thought it was giving me my child support.  My translation's bad.  Sorry.  What does that mean?  Give it to me heart, baby.  Give it to me heart.  Oh, nice.  Okay, Antoine, give me some child support.  Give it to me heart.  That must be math.  I'm kidding.  It's a stereotype.  Oh, please.  And we can all, well, whatever. 
[02:49:00]  All right, Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Fox Calico from the message board.  Right on, man.  I learned today that the Gothels is no longer the worst bridge.  We certainly did.  Nice.  Later, Hammond.  All right.  Hey, Steve, you're next.  What's up?  Hey, Steve, what's going on, guys?  Yeah, what's up?  I learned today that Opie doesn't get into the woods.  I also learned that Rick likes to slow dance.  And I learned that Ken Stevens is getting a boob job.  Right.  Hey.  See you, guys.  You were paying attention.  Very good.  You guys paid attention to the whole show.  All right.  Al, what's up? 
[02:49:30]  Hey there, Opie.  How's it going?  You're doing real good, Bob Murphy.  No, Anthony does.  Yeah, I know, Bob.  I know.  Yeah.  Excellent.  All right.  That's up.  Thank you.  Thank you, Al.  He couldn't get out of it.  Today, I learned three things that ease PMS.  Yeah.  Marijuana, ball-peen hammers, and strip clubs.  Yeah.  We did learn that.  What an educational show.  I didn't realize. 
[02:50:00]  Let's get to Savage.  We should be professors.  Savage.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I actually learned two things.  Yeah.  I learned ONA, like the Make-A-Wish Foundation for perverts.  Yeah.  We did learn that today.  Yeah.  I also learned women are inferior.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  Inferior and incompetent.  You know what I'm talking about.  The court says that.  All right.  That's right.  Two more of our ladies came into the studio.  Did you guys get your pictures taken yet?  No.  Not yet.  Not yet.  We're running out of time.  Oh, you didn't take them yet?  Two more lovely ladies, Anthony.  How you doing, girls?  All right.  Where are you from?  West Nolford. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, you both came together?  Yeah.  For your friends?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good thing.  They may even be sisters.  No.  No.  They say the same thing at the same time, though.  Just friends.  Yeah.  Awfully strange.  Well, that's good.  You're vying for your chance to get the trip to Hawaii.  Yeah.  Now you got twice, because if you win, you'll probably take her.  No.  I'm stuck.  We got pushed into coming down here by our friends outside.  Wait a minute.  If you won, you wouldn't take her?  No.  To Hawaii?  So nice. 
[02:51:00]  Well, that sucks.  I thought they were, like, pooling their effort.  All right.  That's good.  Okay.  Any wowing in the studio right here?  In the near future?  The future was three seconds long?  God, this is so easy.  There you go.  Oh, hey.  Nice.  There you go.  No mark.  You can't tune in Tokyo.  All right.  Well, let's get the ladies in there.  Pictures taken.  Yes.  We're running out of time. 
[02:51:30]  Ladies, thanks for coming down.  We appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  As always.  We would talk more, but we're leaving the show in, like, two minutes.  Yes.  Make sure we come to see you tonight, guys.  Yes.  Double Ds.  Double Ds.  We will.  I'll have my pants down and I'll wait in, okay?  All right.  All right.  Thank you for coming today.  She'll have her pants down.  Come again.  That's good.  Good stuff.  And, Stinky Sister, did you retake your pictures?  They were lovely.  It was so much fun.  Oh, my God.  Isn't that great?  Don't they look like brother and sister? 
[02:52:00]  I got pictures of them together with whipped cream.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  The lighting was crappy, but I think I'm going to try and redo it before I leave.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Well, thank you, Stinky Sister.  Nyoka.  You're awesome.  And I don't even know how to spell your name because I'm not good.  It's New York is okay, eh?  I know.  N-Y-O-K-A.  Uh-oh.  Look, she's even got a little system there to tell people New York is okay, eh?  No, New York is okay, eh?  New York. 
[02:52:30]  Wait, hold on.  Psycho.  Hold on.  Psycho.  Matt, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Wow, what do you call it?  Today I learned Anthony offering hot girls drugs is the same as comics insulting each other.  After it, he's always just kidding.  And I love him.  All right.  Good job.  All right.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned that executions, just like divorces, can go on and on and on. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  And I also learned, well, I had a question for Ant.  Ant, what inning do you have to put your girlfriend down for the night after she's watching the  baseball game?  Oh, my God.  I went down.  You know, I was blowing off all those calls because I know you're just in a bad mood today  because of what's going on in a divorce court somewhere.  But there's so many.  I thought that was audio of my case, but it was the execution.  It sounded the same.  Only there's a worse outcome in the court. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  I learned Psycho Mark is not in studio.  I've learned that you're more relaxed when you're dead.  True.  I learned it's not okay if your friend feels up your breast implants.  I learned marijuana can ruin a party.  That's true.  What I learned from now on, Stinky, will be known as Lube Boy.  Lube Boy.  Lube Boy. 
[02:54:00]  I think you did a great job with the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  I want to thank Nicky Sterling for stopping in today.  Yes.  The Nicky Sterling.  The new champion of the Whiffle Ball Bat.  Yes.  By the way, you know, I, and I rarely, rarely look for any credit or kudos on this show.  I come in here, I do what I want to do, I have a lot of fun, and I never look.  I'm usually pretty modest.  Yeah.  I got no kudos for getting her to do the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge today. 
[02:54:30]  I doubt it.  You did?  Yeah, there was a lot of bowing going on.  No one said, well, good job, Ant, or nothing like that.  Well, thank you, Anthony.  You're very welcome, Stinky.  No, I will thank you, because that was just phenomenal all the way around.  But let's face it, guys, she's a porn star.  I know, that's what I was getting at, Rick.  But she didn't look like a porn star.  That girl could have walked down Madison Avenue, and you would just think she's some very wealthy porn star.  A very wealthy porn star. 
[02:55:00]  Wealthy, good-looking lady.  She had the jewels and the trendy pocketbook.  She had the whole package working.  Yes.  And she shoves Whiffle Ball Bat's places.  Todd, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, today I learned that Obie found some fuzz on his nuts.  He did.  Later, Helmut.  Wow.  I love when they're not exposed.  That's good.  Because I'm sure every day when some of these come through, what did we learn?  Someone in their car somewhere is like, what? 
[02:55:30]  What does that mean?  When did Obie find fuzz on his nuts?  And why wasn't I listening?  I learned if you move your spine and turn your head over your shoulder, you can take seven.  Oh, what I learned today was that Kimmy from Survivor could have the chance to have the best O&A plug ever.  Ever.  She said she would try tonight.  We'll see what happens.  Final episode of Survivor.  We love Kimmy. 
[02:56:00]  Yes.  She said she's going to go for the mention tonight.  Yeah, Earnhardt knows how to get a quick divorce.  All right, we got to go.  Pictures will be up on WNAW.com.  Lots of ladies showed up today.  And tomorrow's the last day to qualify.  We got to stop the qualifying.  And we'll start the voting to see who goes to Hawaii, courtesy of Contiki Tours and Victory Limousine, as we do the whipped cream bikini contest, Anthony.  Right.  Thanks, guys.  We appreciate it.  And we're out of here. 
[02:56:30]  See you tomorrow.  Yeah.  This is not the Discovery Channel.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The movie and wacko show. </pre>
