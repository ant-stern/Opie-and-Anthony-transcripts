<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast begins with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in typical crude banter, covering topics ranging from the New York City heat and women's cleavage to a graphic description of one host's dermatologist visit, including a pre-cancerous spot.  They discuss cell phone cancer, texting versus calling,  70s suntan lotion, and animal mating habits, veering into a discussion about the age of menstruation and its implications.  A listener calls in to express support for the Miami Heat, leading to a comparison of LeBron James and Michael Jordan.  The hosts briefly touch on *America's Got Talent*, including a taser-wielding juggler, and play a clip of a bad singer from *American Idol*.  A significant portion of the show is dedicated to the Casey Anthony trial, focusing on the 911 call, Casey's demeanor, and the hosts' sarcastic tweets about the case.  An audio clip of a New York Post interview with Jim Norton about his apartment and dating life is played.  A Kansas City listener calls in, claiming to be a better singer than an *America's Got Talent* contestant, and briefly performs "I Walk the Line".  A caller, Rocky Graves, phones in and sings a raspy rendition of a Johnny Cash song.  The hosts comment on his voice and unusual last name. Rocky also mentions being called "Special Ed" by Howard Stern.


The show then shifts to a detailed discussion of the Anthony Weiner scandal, including speculation about a hacked Twitter account, playing audio from Weiner's evasive press conference.  The hosts harshly criticize Weiner's inability to simply deny sending the nude photo. This transitions into a heated discussion about Memorial Day weekend violence, particularly incidents involving large groups of African-Americans. Anthony expresses considerable frustration about a perceived lack of accountability, citing news reports of chaotic scenes. Opie and Norton attempt to moderate Anthony's anger, leading to a debate about the underlying causes of the violence. Paul from Philly calls in, echoing similar sentiments and explaining why he stayed home that weekend. The Weiner scandal and social issues remain central to this segment.


The next segment opens with a caller, Paul from Chester, Pennsylvania, complaining about the negative media portrayal of his hometown.  The hosts and Paul discuss the media's focus on crime and violence while ignoring positive contributions, touching on racial dynamics and perceptions of large groups of black teenagers.  The conversation returns to the Anthony Weiner scandal, playing audio from his press conference and featuring analysis from the hosts and a caller, Dana. The hosts engage in humorous and sexually explicit commentary, referring to the scandal as "Wienergate."  The "FU Line" is then played, featuring angry and vulgar messages from listeners. Otto from the comedy duo "Otto and George" joins the show in studio. The conversation continues with further discussion of Weiner, Otto's recent party, celebrity gossip (including Chaz Bono), and the challenges of early mornings.  A discussion about movie preservation and pan and scan follows, leading to reminiscing about classic films and the differences between theatrical and television presentations.


The final segment begins with a discussion about a bizarre dance number and the band Devo, segueing into a critique of several movies including *Brother from Another Planet*, *Soul Plane*, and *Snakes on a Plane*.  The conversation shifts to Casey Anthony's appearance and various notorious female criminals, including Susan Smith and Andrea Yates.  A bizarre tangent involves the Long Island serial killer case and Joel Rifkin.  Comedian Rich Voss is mentioned, leading to a comedic bit about his self-proclaimed status as an FBI profiler.  The hosts discuss an 87-year-old woman found in a fire ant pile, including graphic descriptions of her injuries.  Various insect bites and stings are discussed, focusing on bullet ant rituals.  A caller, Nick, has a poor connection.  An interview with Otto follows, covering his upcoming internet variety show, "The Otto and George Pig Roast," including planned guests and comedic approach.  The conversation concludes with more off-color banter, including a discussion about a transvestite Super Bowl commercial, technical issues with the online stream, and general dissatisfaction with their radio situation.  The hosts briefly mention a scene from *What About Bob* and a Chinese premier playing basketball.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on?  Live? No, is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, let's do this.  Good morning. Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody.  How's everybody today?  How are you?  Goodly.  You know, over the hump.  Trying to get over the hump.  Hump, July.  June 1st.  Yes, it is June 1st.  Wow.  So, um...  Didn't we just have snow?  Yeah, it seems like it went from, uh, yeah, winter right into summer. 
[00:01:30]  We're looking at 90 degrees today, by the way, here in wonderful New York City.  Are we all gonna bitch about the heat now?  Fuck that. I'm one of those guys. Bring it on.  I remember how cold it was in the winter.  Believe me, I love that, too.  And, uh...  Just bring it the fuck on.  I'm not gonna bitch.  The news sucks, because they're the ones that, after one hot day, they'll be like, to the weatherman,  Bill, uh, how long is this heat wave gonna last?  Right.  When's some relief?  Yeah, exactly.  Relief. It was just, like, a week and a half ago, it was freezing. 
[00:02:00]  Should we remind you what it was like?  Yay!  There was a cold rain, and it was hinting that it might hail in New York City.  Yeah, that was about ten days ago.  I love the heat.  We got a bunch of Marys out there. Enjoy the heat.  And in here.  And in here. Enjoy what the women are wearing, because it's so fucking hot.  Yeah, that's always nice.  Cleavage is in this season, I think.  That's always nice.  We're gonna have to get the fashion police on the show, because I think cleavage is in.  The fashion police.  I'm starting to see that women just look at their boobs as just mounds of flesh. 
[00:02:30]  They're busums.  Yeah, they're just letting them fucking hang out at this point.  Let their freak flags fly.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The cleavage is definitely a little lower this year.  Yeah, they're showing a little more.  Are you a fan of the cleavage?  I like the cleavage as long as it's not sloppy.  Yeah, sloppy cleavage sucks.  I like using the cleavage as a guide to undressing a woman with my eyes.  You know what I mean?  It's like, you're walking down the street, you see some cleavage, and then you see what's covered, 
[00:03:00]  but you could really get a good impression of what she would look like naked from the top.  And sometimes that cleavage goes like a little too long.  It's like a big chest ass crack.  You just don't need that much cleavage.  You nailed it with long.  Yeah.  You don't want a long cleavage.  You just know she has long tits.  Yeah.  And summer dresses are in this year, too, I noticed.  Yeah.  Those flowing, kind of almost see-through-y.  I like that.  Mostly white.  Summer-y.  Or an off-white.  Just blowing in the wind. 
[00:03:30]  A sundress.  Yes.  Yes.  Most of those.  Speaking of summer, I went to the skin doctor yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  And I get my yearly skin check.  Where they paw over you like a chimp.  Just kind of fucking biting mites off of you.  Have you had your skin checked yet?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've done that.  You do do that?  Dermatologist.  But you have the darker skin, so you might be a little better off than me.  Yeah, it's from the Moors.  Let me tell you a little story.  The Moors did so much fucking.  My skin doctor? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Very good looking.  What's his name?  Middle-aged woman.  Oh.  Boo.  No gag.  And I think she's, I think she's like, I think she's, if I had to guess, early 40s?  Yeah.  Mid-40s?  Mm-hmm.  Definitely hot.  I know that surprises Anthony.  No, no, I've seen it.  Because I don't think he thinks a woman could be hot in her 40s.  No, no, I've seen it.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, because she's a skin doctor, I think she kind of does some things. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  A little Botox here, a little chemical peel here.  A little dermatology, huh?  And this year I noticed that she might be going too far.  Ah.  Girls could get a little work done on their face, but then all of a sudden they hit that  stage, they go too far.  Nicole Kidman is a perfect example of someone that went too far.  So when they smile, parts of their face are frozen from the Botox, and it doesn't move  with the rest of the smile.  And that's where you get that creepy Muppet face.  That, uh, when Cher had that done, and she was all like... 
[00:05:00]  Cher has Muppet face.  She couldn't talk.  Joan Rivers has...  See, Muppet face, because look.  Oh, look what she did to her lip.  Parts of the face doesn't really move when you smile.  Her mouth looks like a prolapsed asshole.  Who is that?  That's Nicole Kidman.  Nicole Kidman.  Oh, no.  But when she's not smiling, she still looks all right.  She had narrow Irish lips at one point in her life, and now she just doesn't have them  anymore.  She's, uh...  Yeah.  Joan Rivers has the Muppet face, like we said. 
[00:05:30]  I'm trying to remember some other people, but whatever.  I think Goldie Hawn has Muppet face.  Oh, Goldie Hawn's terrible now.  And my doctor, because she's the skin doctor, I think she's...  Vinnie Boob Buffs.  She's getting to that point, because I brought my son.  And she was like, she was fawning over my son and smiling, and I saw the beginning  of Muppet face, and I wanted to tell her a thing or two.  About a thing or two.  Before she told me a thing or two about my skin.  Yeah.  It's hard to mention that to a lady. 
[00:06:00]  I know.  Relax on the Botox is what I wanted to tell her.  You're almost unfuckable, madam.  I don't know how to tell you that.  It was just a hint that parts of her face might be starting to get too frozen.  They look...  I knew it, Shikku, did that, and I kept looking at her going, what the fuck's wrong with  her face?  What are you doing?  That's what it is.  But I didn't know her before.  I only knew her after.  They figured out that when they're not smiling, it actually looks good, but they can't figure  out what to do to make the smile look natural, because it lifts up all this shit, and this  shit is supposed to move when you're smiling.  It doesn't anymore.  Yeah, you need those muscles. 
[00:06:30]  Right?  Yeah.  So I guess it's maybe just fucking freezing the muscles.  Yeah, that's what it does.  It paralyzes the muscles or some shit.  So then she was checking out my body.  She gets to lift my ball bag.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  She gets under the ball bag, looks at the taint.  Yeah.  And I walked all the way over there from the west side to the east side.  Oh, so you were a little sweaty down there?  Oh, and then I had to lay on my belly.  I'm like, oh, you do not want to do this.  Wow.  She really gets, she digs deep. 
[00:07:00]  She earns her keep.  She gets down and dirty.  Earn that money, B.I.  You think that's a turn on for some lady doctors when all of a sudden they pull that robe aside  and see the ball bag?  Sure.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Somebody threw a cab, maybe.  Not if they walked.  And then the big news, I got, I got, I think it's called like pre, pre, pre skin cancer.  Here comes the pre. 
[00:07:30]  On my fucking hand that I got burned off.  Yeah?  That's why I go, I'm a fair skinned motherfucker that spent way too much time at beaches and  caddying.  Isn't that ironic they burn it off after you're getting a sunburn?  No, it's like literally the lowest form.  It's technically probably not even skin cancer, but will lead to that if you don't fucking do  something about it.  The cells are just starting to get a little wacky.  The cells are starting to go like, hey, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  Let me start eating something.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's like, ah, get them out of there quick before they get the knife and fork. 
[00:08:00]  They start bubbling and they start getting a little restless.  Yeah.  We need to do something different.  I don't know.  I know what I'm supposed to do, but I'm kind of losing my mind.  Being the hypochondriac I am, she had a fucking, you know.  Yeah.  Well, but I think we all are kind of.  Hey, burn off.  Get the soldering iron out.  She goes, this is, this is nothing.  But then I wanted to thank the Huntington Crescent Club for this, this, this nice little scar  I'm going to have on my hand.  Oh, really?  Because, yeah, all those years of caddy and you carry the golf bags by putting your hands 
[00:08:30]  right on the woods.  Winning that caddy tournament and not getting skin cancer.  That's important.  And then the sun just fucking beats down on your hands all day long.  And then you fast forward a couple decades and guess what?  Hello.  Hello.  Put on some sunscreen, Danny.  Well, that's what we talked about.  There was no sunscreen when we were growing up.  No, no, growing up.  How'd she burn it off?  She actually, with a chemical.  Oh.  It hurts?  No.  She said it was going to hurt, so I said it doesn't hurt.  So then I'm like, well, what does that mean? 
[00:09:00]  A chemical.  Wow.  They just like put some acid on you and shit?  Yeah, it was acid, actually.  Some form of acid.  Nice corrosive.  I knew.  I've been studying this fucking little thing in my hand for three months going, man, I just  know that's not fucking good.  I have like little, little beauty marks.  I'm the fucking...  The beauty marks?  Yeah, I really am.  I'm basically just a walking conduit for beauty marks.  Well, the thing with...  Because you're beautiful.  Yay!  The thing with skin cancer in general, if you catch it early, it's a piece of cake. 
[00:09:30]  So, you know, if you get screened every once in a while, you should be all right.  You should be all right.  I should go this week.  And just stay out of the sun, would you?  That's impossible, though.  Wear your sunscreen.  That's impossible.  Everyone likes a little tan.  I don't care who the fuck you are.  A little tan's fine, right?  And I went in there with this beet red nose.  I'm like, I've really been good lately, but Memorial Day weekend, and you know...  Your nose got red, definitely.  Really red, yeah.  And your forehead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like, but I have been much better lately.  But fuck, after having that shitty winter, and all of a sudden you get that first beautiful 
[00:10:00]  day in the 80s, and you're at a beach, you're like, you know what?  You just want to lay down in the sun and bake.  And get a little color on you.  Yeah.  I know.  I've been cultivating my little tannage from the cruise, actually.  It was the first one.  Started that out.  Since then, the backyard's great.  Laid down after work and shit like that.  Go in the pool.  I go from red to a little light tan.  Yeah.  But she's like...  Fair-skinned.  She said, when we were growing up, we didn't have sunblock. 
[00:10:30]  Nope.  Because we still call it suntan lotion, meaning, give me the suntan lotion, because I don't  want to get sunburned.  But it was called suntan lotion when we were growing up, because you used it to get more  sun on your body, basically.  It was oil.  It was oil.  Oil doesn't protect against it.  If anything, it makes a layer of like Fresnel lens on you, which just intensifies the sun.  Remember, it was a little sticky, and it was a little glistening, and you just knew  you were going to burn the shit out of your body?  It was clear.  And then she named a brand. 
[00:11:00]  She named a brand yesterday, and she goes, remember the smell?  And it brought me right back.  And me and Danny are trying to find it.  I can't remember what she fucking said, but it's a really old school one.  But as soon as she said it, I went, oh, yeah, something from the 70s.  The 70s.  And my parents, even if there was some kind of sunblock, we didn't use it.  You know, that was...  No, no.  That was for faggots.  No, it was more of a luxury.  Yeah, you just didn't know.  My mom decided, you know what, I could save the five bucks.  Yeah, why bother? 
[00:11:30]  So then we would just, you know...  Send the kids out to turn beet red.  Well, I told you, we had the beach house in Waiting River, my grandma's house.  And my mom decided, well, I could save money on sunblock or suntan lotion.  Suntan lotion.  And we would be burnt to shit every day.  Burnt to shit.  And I don't think we had skin doctors back then, right?  No, no one went to them.  You went to your general practitioner.  You went to your pediatrician.  And you hoped he had some experience on these other things.  The specialist shit only happened in the last, I don't know, maybe 20 years probably, right? 
[00:12:00]  It was like mesothelioma.  No one knew about it until a few years back.  No.  What the fuck is that?  Speaking of cancers, what do you think of the cell phone cancer shit that they're bringing up again?  Oh, now they're saying it's fucking...  Top of the tone, Crisco, no.  Keep trying.  Sorry, go ahead.  And now it's saying that you're using the cell phone?  You get brain cancer.  Yeah, but who uses their phone?  World Health Organization has said that.  But wouldn't it be more hand cancer and ball cancer? 
[00:12:30]  Because no one uses their phone to call anymore.  Well, I don't know if it's cancer no matter where you put it.  Or if it's just strictly brain cancer from putting it to your head.  Yeah, but not many people do that anymore.  I know.  Ten years ago, seven years ago, five years ago, yeah, we were all using them to make phone calls.  You get finger cancer from putting texts on texting.  Isn't it weird that we come up with this technology where you could hear other people far, far away,  and we don't even use that technology anymore?  We'd rather write them.  We'd rather just write.  Because people are... 
[00:13:00]  All in all, people are annoying.  And you don't want to talk to them.  So it's easier to just text.  I don't like phone calls.  A lot of times I'll get a phone call.  I'll let it ring and ring and ring.  And then maybe they'll leave a message.  Maybe they won't.  And then I'll just text back.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, exactly.  Like, I didn't want to talk.  Tell me what's going on.  If it's an important text and something that can't be texted back, then I'll call back.  Texting showed all of us that no one has anything to say.  Yeah.  Because those used to be ten-minute phone calls for them to say one thing. 
[00:13:30]  Because they felt like now we've got to converse about nonsense.  And then, like you said, you write them back real fast and realize they had a quick question.  You answer the question.  You're done with it.  Quickie.  Done.  Done.  Band of Soleil.  Band of Soleil.  That might be...  For the Saint-Tropez-Tan.  How do you know that?  That was their slogan.  I should be...  I get so frustrated by your Rain Man mentality.  I can't remember what I did yesterday.  How do you know that?  But I remember fucking ads from the 60s and 70s. 
[00:14:00]  How would you know that?  How did you know that?  It's called two people screaming in the other room.  While little fucking Frady Cat focused on that little magical tube in front of them.  The magic box, which took the little waif away from the yelling adults.  It took me away.  It took him to...  Far Away Lons.  A better place.  Fuck you, bitch.  I don't want to hear it.  Ba-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da-da.  This is great.  It might be Banda Soleil, yeah.  I think that's what she mentioned. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, that definitely had a distinct smell.  Reminds me of Crab Meadow Beach.  Remember, this might be local, because I don't think they have it elsewhere, except the East Coast Mussels, right?  Mussels.  I have them everywhere.  Now that we're older, Mussels are a fucking delicacy.  You go into a nice Italian restaurant, we're talking about the black mussels.  They put in a nice wine sauce or a red sauce with fresh tomatoes.  And you'll eat that shit all night, right?  A little spice on it to make it a little hot.  When we were growing up, Ant has mentioned Crab Meadow Beach. 
[00:15:00]  They were everywhere.  Everywhere.  And you wouldn't eat that.  You'd just smash them.  You would smash them and be like, ew, with all the goop that would drip out.  Correct.  I didn't even realize you could eat those growing up.  I bet you people that were in charge when we were growing up didn't realize you could eat them.  And then just one day decided, well, let's see if we can make something out of this.  Yeah.  And why did the horseshoe crab never take off as a food?  Like, we were talking about that once.  The horseshoe crab, I've never seen them anywhere but on the Long Island's North Shore. 
[00:15:30]  They look like they came from the fucking, like, the Paleozoic era.  They're, like, real old, like a trilobite or something.  Well, no, why?  There's no meat to them.  They've got that dumb hard shell and a couple legs.  You know what they look like?  They look like the alien thing that grabs onto your face.  Ah.  And they have a tail.  Right.  That's very stiff instead of that snakey one that choked you, an alien. 
[00:16:00]  You turn them on their back and it just looks like evil shrimp looking at you.  That's it.  Evil shrimp.  And nothing else to eat.  What are you going to eat on a horseshoe crab?  Maybe there's meat in those legs.  What legs?  Any meat in the tail?  Well.  They got little legs.  Growing up, we had to watch out for horseshoe crabs because I guess, help me out, Ant.  The stinger had poison in it.  No.  A myth.  That was a myth.  Purely a myth.  They didn't use the stinger for, they didn't, like, pop that up for stinging. 
[00:16:30]  It wasn't a defensive tool.  What was it?  It was used for, like, scraping to get food or something off the bottom.  There was no poison in that thing.  No poison.  My whole fucking life I thought, holy shit, I could get some poison from a horseshoe crab.  No, it was never, it isn't a defensive item.  Yeah, it's pretty much made so little kids can hold them up by it.  Right.  Is it?  Nah, you throw them back in the water.  Is it their peeners?  No, I don't think it's their peener either.  I know when they have some of that horseshoe crab sex, those things pop up in the air a 
[00:17:00]  little bit.  Maybe to get out of the way so they can get there.  Yeah, maybe to get out of the way.  It is hinged a bit.  Yeah.  It is hinged a tad.  Don't like horseshoe crabs mating.  But the one in front would pop up in stinger or whatever it is.  It's like two helmets just fucking laying on top of each other.  The male, much smaller than the female.  Maybe just in that relationship.  Yeah, maybe.  Big fat horseshoe crab wife.  Gang bang.  It's a fucking gang bang.  A horseshoe crab gang bang we're looking at.  Five on one.  I got a question for Professor. 
[00:17:30]  They don't know.  They're fucking a rock.  I got a question for Professor Anthony.  Ah, yes.  In nature.  Yeah.  Do animals ever make love or is it always just rape?  I think it's just rape.  Because over the weekend I saw a couple, I guess they would be ducks going at it.  Yeah.  And I'm like, that can't be fun for the female who's just yelling and screaming and trying  to fly away.  And this thing is just forcing itself on the duck.  And then it made me think that I think in the animal kingdom, all they do is rape and 
[00:18:00]  they don't actually have like fucking consensual sex.  Yeah.  And you're standing there by the pond just jerking off and throwing bread at them.  But ducks do mate for life.  They do.  Yeah.  They pick one and that's their mate for life.  And a lot of times if their mate dies, they just fucking wind up dying too because they're  so, their little duck hearts are broken.  Yeah.  But what animals have you ever seen where it looks all nice and both parties are enjoying? 
[00:18:30]  It's always some just animalistic, over-the-top, holy shit thing happening in front of you.  No monkeys?  Monkeys don't do that?  I think the female's screaming way before a little penis enters.  It's pretty much rape.  It is, right?  I think it's just rape.  Okay.  The males duke it out for the pleasure of getting the female.  For the pleasure of raping the female.  Because the strongest one has to rape the female for survival of the, you know, species.  It is.  Yeah.  I don't think anyone really, you know. 
[00:19:00]  And this question's going to, this question's going to make you happy, Ed.  So.  Do you want to leave right now?  Wow.  Yes.  Now I'm happy.  It's that part of that's true.  I know it's true in my heart.  No, we have a, we have a meeting after the show.  I love meetings.  I was really reprimanded after I left here yesterday.  Why?  About the meeting.  Oh, because, because you blew them off last week.  Got any excuses?  The tree's gone.  You don't have this. 
[00:19:30]  You don't have that.  I'm like, yeah, I got nothing.  Got to make the meeting today.  Here's the morality question of the day.  Yes.  Which is going to be easy for you to answer.  But.  Oh.  If, if, if girls are getting their periods at, I learned yesterday 11, but then someone  else in this group of people said nine.  Yeah.  Isn't that nature's way of saying they're ready to have kids?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although I've heard that this premature menstruation, menstruation. 
[00:20:00]  Is because of the Big Macs.  Could be because of certain, or just environment and shit.  Some people say it's the food with all the hormones in it, but that's kind of a, they're not sure  about that.  Yeah.  Certain girls.  And, and, and I believe African American girls start having their periods earlier than  other girls.  These were white people.  Were they whiteys?  Whiteys saying daughter 11.  And then someone else said nine.  Nine?  Nine. 
[00:20:30]  Mm.  Very white people, by the way.  I don't know.  It might just be some kind of thing.  I don't think it's, I don't think it's supposed to happen that way.  Hmm.  But it is happening that way.  And, uh, no, I don't think, I don't think psychologically you're ready for a sex.  I think maybe.  No, obviously.  Biologically.  But that means like, yeah, go ahead.  But, uh.  But isn't it the rules of nature?  In other words, I'm actually going out on a limb here saying, don't fuck nine-year-olds.  No, of course not.  Of course.  Going out on a limb.  But that, uh, the rules of nature are saying something different. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, nature's saying, ah, you could have a kid.  Well, we decided, well, let's slow the fuck down a little bit.  That's crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  The rules of nature say that when two people smile at each other, they're both old enough.  Smiles?  That's it?  Sure.  Even a coochie-coo smile?  Sure.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  When you say hi and they go, meh.  You're despicable, Uncle Paul.  You ever get diaper tape in your pubes?  Never.  I can say never. 
[00:21:30]  You're snooty.  You're sick.  Wow, is that true?  Black vultures meet for life.  And if one vulture is suspected of cheating, a community of vultures will attack the cheating vulture.  Wow.  Yeah, but man, in nature, they're just raping.  They're not having sex.  As long as he doesn't rape a dove, that's all I care about.  Yeah, leave it alone.  Surprise.  I went to bed at halftime.  This fucking Miami Heat.  They're going to win this damn championship, Ant. 
[00:22:00]  Well, why aren't they supposed to?  I mean, all that money, all the superstars.  And I've been bitching about the Miami Heat all year.  I don't know where the fans are because everyone's in agreement.  No one wants to see the Heat win this thing unless you live in Miami.  Usually, you get other cities and people going, you know what?  My team's out of it, but I kind of want to see the Heat win.  Yeah.  In this case, that's not true.  Yeah.  Well, no one wants to see it because they're that bought team. 
[00:22:30]  Kind of like the Yankees.  They loaded them up.  Well, you know, the Yankees of a few years ago.  The Yankees were a farm.  The dynasty Yankees were a farm.  They were a farm team for a while.  You're right.  All of them were the farms.  And then they kept it going by just buying players.  Like, they would make good fits.  Like, Knobloch was a nice fit when they had, at second, they had a few big guys they brought in.  Good old Knobloch.  Yeah, OCD Chuck would take 45 minutes to fucking, to swing the bat.  Remember that shit?  Helmet, elbow, helmet, elbow, knees, toes, helmet, elbow, bat.  Swing, walk, bat, helmet, elbow, toes, eyes. 
[00:23:00]  Exhausting.  You think he's doing that in his real life now that he's not playing baseball?  Oh, he's fucking horrendous.  Open the toilet, close the toilet, spindle it, elbow, knees, toes, eyes.  Got it, Chuck.  Hasn't left the house in 10 years.  He's still trying to figure out what the combination is to leave the house.  Fucking kook he is.  But I went to bed.  It was a good, close game.  And Miami Heat take the first one.  Fuck.  They pulled it off.  I don't even know why I care.  Why do I care?  You just didn't want him to win. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You just didn't want him to win.  I know you don't like talking basketball, but a lot of outrage because Scottie Pippen came  out of nowhere, and we forgot to talk about this, over the long weekend, and said that  LeBron James is a better player than Michael Jordan.  Oh, I did read that, yeah.  What is wrong with Scottie Pippen?  I guess he's a...  Ungrateful fuck.  No.  Even if you think that, why would you say that?  Michael Jordan gave you all those championships.  You didn't...  You helped, sure.  But Jordan would have done it with another guy if you weren't on the team. 
[00:24:00]  Does he have any financial interest in the Heat?  I don't know, man.  But that's...  Is he a GM or something?  I don't know, but the sports world is like, fuck you, Scottie Pippen.  Even if you think it's true.  Yeah, that's kind of a bad thing to say.  You're not the guy that should be saying that.  Even if you think it's true, really.  Yeah, it's kind of...  Dude, it was Jordan and Pippen forever.  And Jordan won a bunch of those championships on his back.  He put the whole fucking team on his back.  Yeah.  Standing on his head?  Pretty much.  Well, it's not like fucking...  Scottie Pippen certainly helped, yes. 
[00:24:30]  But my point, Jordan would have found somebody else to play that role, or the organization would have.  It's not like LeBron has won anything yet.  If he had won like three championships and he said that, they'd be like, all right, but he's won zero.  I just think, you know, even if he thinks that, shut up.  Do you need attention, really, to just beat up Jordan like that?  You know, because Jordan wants to be known as the best player ever.  Yeah, I think no matter what Scottie Pippen says, people will remember Jordan and think,  people were shocked at that statement there. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, you don't watch America's Got Talent, huh?  Nah, nah.  What do you think we like that show?  Nah, it's another...  I know it's not like American Idol, but I put it in the same category.  It's got the judges.  The people come out, they do something, the judges critique them.  I'm done with that type of show.  It's an updated...  I was continuing my Breaking Bad marathon last night.  Oh, really?  Fucking great, great goddamn show.  It's an updated gong show, though.  Yeah, yeah.  And the last act... 
[00:25:30]  Ah, whatever.  The last act on the show was just beyond amazing.  Really?  Hard to explain.  They had to turn all the lights off, and it was wild.  Definitely worth checking out the clip, yeah.  I'll check it out.  Some highlights.  I'll watch highlights of those shows.  Yeah.  Like, I can't sit through the whole thing.  I can't sit through the fake fucking drama and all that shit.  Mm-hmm.  So I just...  I watch highlights.  A guy was juggling with tasers last night.  That's kind of cool.  See, I'd watch that highlight. 
[00:26:00]  And he said, which is kind of hack, he goes,  if I catch both tasers at the same time on the wrong end, I could die.  But if you're a good juggler, that's never going to happen.  No matter what you're juggling, you might catch one with a slip, right?  Yeah.  But you're not stupid enough to hold on to it.  No.  I don't think you'd be able to.  I think you would let it hit the floor, and you realize as a juggler,  oh, fuck, I fucked up that rotation.  I got to just let that one drop.  Let it drop and then kick it into the crowd.  Right. 
[00:26:30]  Here's a guy from Jersey who wants the Miami Heat to win.  Here's a guy.  He's the only one, though, so I don't even need to go to you.  Anyway, guy at American Idol, early on, singer.  I want to play this for you, Ant.  All right.  We don't have to play the whole thing because you're a singer yourself.  You've been in bands.  You had that dream for a while.  Oh, I certainly did.  Keep your mind open and tell me what you think of this guy.  Okay.  It's terrible.  Exactly.  Oh. 
[00:27:00]  Slow your time away.  Let's take a chance.  For a break that would make.  Okay.  It's always some reason to feel not good enough.  And it's hard at the end of the day.  And it's hard at the end of the day. 
[00:27:30]  Sort of a Joe Cocker thing going on.  A little bit, right?  A little Joe Cocker.  You like thumbs up?  A little early Michael Bolton  before he was completely stupid. 
[00:28:00]  But you realize he had a good voice.  Yeah, he's very soulful.  Yeah, that's a guy in there.  May you cry.  Stop calling for me.  Fuck you, Tammy. 
[00:28:30]  Stop calling for me.  Tammy's putting up the video of those sick animals  and the cats with the crust in their eyes.  Oh, those badly behaved animals  that finally received discipline?  Stop calling for me.  Because this is one of those songs they play.  Oh, the poor kitty.  That's the sad song.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  All these poor owners have to deal  with these poorly behaved pets.  Before they get in conjunctivitis.  Absolutely. 
[00:29:00]  I had to kick that fourth leg off.  Wouldn't stop barking.  Watching Family Feud.  It's a reason.  Always a reason.  A little homeless mustard  thrown in there.  Yeah, the guy's good.  Really good, right?  Yeah, what'd they do?  They give him a...  The audience went nuts  and of course, you know,  they loved him.  Yeah.  And then they ask him a question.  You know,  how many days a week do you play out?  He goes,  I just play in my room.  Oh, really?  That's why I'm bringing this to the show. 
[00:29:30]  He doesn't...  How does a guy have a voice like that  and he's not even discovered locally?  Yeah.  He goes,  no, I just play in my room at my house  to my family and friends.  Maybe he doesn't have the,  you know,  the gumption to get out there  in front of people.  He just did it in front of the people.  Well, now, yeah.  Now he'll be huge.  I'm thinking some of this  America's Got Talent  is kind of set up.  They know the big players out there  that just don't have,  you know,  fame yet or contracts yet.  Yeah.  And then something like this,  you'd think this guy's been trying  to make any music forever.  It turns out he just plays at home. 
[00:30:00]  Well, now he'll be huge.  Well, obviously.  It's a life changer.  Yeah, so...  But before that,  some people don't have the,  you know, the bulls.  That's why I brought it to the show.  I couldn't believe a guy  with a voice like that  isn't known at all.  Yeah.  Until yesterday.  Who's that?  Who's that before  and after a picture there, Danny?  That's Avril.  That's what Avril looked like  before?  In high school, probably.  In high school?  Yeah.  She was very nerdy.  She looked funny.  Yeah, no one would have  brought her to the prom. 
[00:30:30]  I like that Avril Lavigne.  She's trashy.  You like her?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Like that Casey Anthony  too.  I was watching that trial yesterday.  They had her in a little,  they had her in a little  fucking,  a little top.  Because I guess the,  the defense wanted  some line of questioning  going on about how  she looked,  how her mother could tell  if she looked pregnant  or not  at  a wedding.  So they had her stand up 
[00:31:00]  and turn sideways  and see if she had  a protruding belly  and if the mother  noticed any difference  between how she looks now  and how she looked  at a certain wedding.  And so,  Why does that matter?  Exactly.  I'm confused.  That's what everybody's saying.  That's what everybody's saying.  The line of questioning  is silly sometimes.  So they were showing  and asking like,  why is,  why are they doing this?  Because she usually  dresses very prim and proper  and she was in this  little number  that was kind of low cut  and really accentuated  those giant  baby killing breasts 
[00:31:30]  of hers.  She was looking good  yesterday, yeah.  She's got big boobs?  Yeah, yeah.  She's got ample  breasts on her  and that wasn't bad.  That wasn't bad.  So, yeah,  just keeping tabs.  Trial got really  heating up yesterday.  The mother got on the stand.  Cindy Anthony,  Casey's mom.  And she's the one  that made the 911 call  when she realized  that the kid was missing  for 31 days. 
[00:32:00]  She found out  that the kid was missing  for 31 days  immediately.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  The grandma didn't know  the kid was gone  for 31 days?  No, because she didn't live  like, you know,  near the daughter.  What kind of relationship  did she have  with the daughter, though?  Good, but it's one  of those deals  where it's like,  you know,  she kept making excuses  like, no,  we can't see the baby.  No, I can't come over.  How far away did she live?  Not exactly sure,  but it wasn't, you know,  next door.  Yeah, but my mother-in-law  is in Philly  and...  Believe me,  we barely go a week.  This is a pretty  dysfunctional family.  Her relationship's different  than hers probably.  Oh, yeah.  31 days without seeing... 
[00:32:30]  No way.  And she kept saying shit,  you know, like,  oh, no, she's out.  She's with this one.  You can't do that.  You know,  when the mother  would come over,  we'll say you're  in fucking Tustin  picking up a load.  Fucking Scagnetti  comes over.  Fucking prick.  Yeah, so she...  The mother took the stand.  She starts...  They start playing  the 911 call.  And this is the second  the mother found out  that...  Or the grandmother,  actually,  of the child  found out that  the kid was missing. 
[00:33:00]  She called 911  and just starts  going crazy.  My granddaughter's missing.  But...  And then they get  Casey Anthony on the phone  and she's like,  yeah, hello.  Why is the daughter missing?  Ah, she's been missing  31 days.  And then the 911 operator  is like,  why haven't you called sooner?  She's like,  well, I've been looking  on my own  and using other avenues.  Can we hear this?  Oh, yeah.  It's classic.  It's right there.  I've got to hear this.  Here's the...  And the grandmother  is bought like... 
[00:33:30]  Her head is down.  She's shaking, crying.  She's got to ask  the judge for a break  because the grandmother's  freaking out.  And the daughter,  who is the actual  mother of the child,  Casey,  is just kind of  dabbing an occasional  tear from her eye  just looking around.  She's the most  hateable woman  in the country.  She is a narcissistic,  psychopath,  compulsive liar.  Yeah.  And I just want to  have some nasty  baby killer sex  with her.  Fuck her 
[00:34:00]  and then open her throat.  Bleed her out  like a fucking cow.  And I'm tweeting  her defense.  That's...  Relentlessly tweeting  her defense.  And these house frows  that are sitting  watching this trial  are hating me.  How could you say that?  A baby has died?  I'm like,  yes,  and let this woman grieve.  Why are they putting  her through this?  You know,  obviously she's upset.  And they're like,  upset!  She did nothing!  She went 31 days 
[00:34:30]  without looking  for her child.  I go,  she was looking  in the clubs!  And the women  are so pissed at me.  You got a really  good bit going.  It's very funny.  It's so much fun.  Are you sniping them  or are they coming  after you?  They come after me  because I hashtag it.  I hashtag Casey Anthony  so that the ones  that are on the  Casey Anthony page  can read my shit.  Great.  Because it's a bunch  of people that  I have no idea  who they are.  One woman's just like,  why don't you get a job?  I'm like,  I have one.  Defending Casey Anthony. 
[00:35:00]  And then I said,  please stay tuned  to my tweets  because I'm having  a fundraiser  for her defense  and she's going  to need money  when she's freed.  Freed!  She's never getting out!  I go,  I'm glad close-minded  like people like you  I hope aren't  on the jury.  It's just,  it's pissing them off.  Oh my God,  it's awesome.  It really is great.  All right,  let's hear the 911 call.  Yeah,  this is a,  I don't know.  She has been missing  for a month.  Her mother finally admitted 
[00:35:30]  that she's been missing.  Okay,  what is the address  that you're calling from?  4937 Hope Spring Drive.  We're talking about  a three-year-old little girl.  As the 911 call  played for jurors,  the once-grandmother  hunched lower  and lower  behind the stand  as if the sadness  of reliving  the recorded moments  was just too much  as if the sound  of her own voice  weighed invisibly  on her shoulders.  There's something wrong.  I found my daughter's car today  and it smelled like  there's been a dead body  in a damn car. 
[00:36:00]  Okay,  what is the three-year-old's name?  Kaylee.  C-A-Y-L-E-E.  Anthony.  Kaylee Anthony?  In the car seat  where Kaylee usually sat,  Cindy recounted  finding a baby doll.  Kaylee's doll  smelled like the car,  so I took it out  and in our garage  we have a ice chest  and I set the doll down  and I went and got  a Clorox wipe  and wiped the face  and the hands.  In the trunk,  Cindy testified  she found Kaylee's backpack 
[00:36:30]  with diapers and clothes.  You can hear her  call out to her husband  in agony  talking to the dispatcher.  Jan Michael Vincent hairdo  on the mother.  That's horrible.  Go to the airwolf hairdo.  Hey, fucking Gary Busey.  Doesn't she look like  she's giving head?  Then you can hear  Cindy passing the phone.  She's blowing Rusty Burrell.  But the conversation  doesn't end there.  Can you tell me  a little bit  what's going on?  My daughter's been missing  for the last 31 days.  And that little portion  was the sound 
[00:37:00]  of Casey Anthony's voice  as she picked up  that phone conversation  with the 911 dispatcher.  Jurors also  recorded jail phone calls  when Casey was arrested.  It is a story  that we're working on.  Yeah, the mother's  freaking out.  My granddaughter,  I just found out  she's missing for a month  and nothing's been done.  And they go,  okay, can we speak  to your daughter?  She's like,  hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Yeah, been missing  for 31 days.  Why didn't you report it?  I've been looking.  What are you going to do?  I've been looking.  Nary a tear.  I fucking hate crazy people. 
[00:37:30]  I really hate them.  Absolutely.  Well, then you  despise Casey Anthony  because let me tell you,  she is batshit fucking crazy.  She's a fucking kook.  Just a kook.  You delicious big-titted kook.  Oh, just a big-titted kook.  Who's the father  of this dead kid?  You know what?  Who knows?  Who knows?  This girl's kind of a hoo-ah.  Yeah.  She brought a bunch of,  you know,  they brought a bunch of  boyfriends up to testify  and the defense is actually saying 
[00:38:00]  that the reason she's so cold  and shows no emotion  is that her father  sexually abused her  when she was younger  and she was able to block that out  by just blocking out emotion  and making like nothing bad happen.  So now when anything bad happens,  she doesn't react to it.  But there's just instance  after instance  of this woman being  a compulsive liar.  She,  a friend took the stand yesterday,  this Amy girl,  and apparently Casey Anthony 
[00:38:30]  had stolen some of her checks  and was writing bad checks.  She's got six felonies on her  for writing bad checks  and lying.  And she's just not a good person  and a horrible mommy.  She's just one of those people  that should just be kind of put down.  Yeah.  Like an animal that doesn't know  how to behave.  Yeah, yeah.  You put a bullet in its head.  And to have a mother say  on a 911 call,  yeah,  her car smells like something's dead. 
[00:39:00]  You know,  that kind of was a blow  to the defense yesterday.  That wacko  put a fucking doll in there  to talk to it  like it was her kid.  Yeah.  And put a doll in the baby seat  and rode around  with a fucking dead kid  in the trunk.  Yeah.  And then she said,  well,  I know who has the baby.  And that was the maid  or the nanny,  Zanny.  Zanny the nanny.  Zanny the nanny.  Zanny the nanny has the kid.  So she's looking for Zanny the nanny.  So what do you think  is going to happen? 
[00:39:30]  Well,  I think  our court system  will fuck it up.  Well,  yeah,  yesterday was a huge day  for the prosecution,  I think.  But being an armchair lawyer,  as I am,  I pass the bar every day,  but I stop for a drink.  Right?  Yeah.  Who are you?  Perry Beer Mason?  That's pretty good.  I know.  I think 
[00:40:00]  that they're going to have  a problem  with really getting this jury  to convict on  first-degree murder.  There's so many  different options  the defense has thrown out there,  so the prosecution  still has to prove  that she did anything.  The emotion is there.  The grandmother crying  on the stand like that,  everything.  But,  you know,  that's all smoke and mirrors.  It does weigh on the jury  as far as emotions go,  but facts.  You need proof  that she killed her baby 
[00:40:30]  with a reason,  a premeditated reason,  which is the motive,  they're saying,  is to get freedom  to go out and party  and, you know,  live her life.  But I don't think  they're proving that.  And if they don't prove it  and there's some kind  of a mistrial  or a hung jury,  they'll probably come back  with another trial,  lower the charges  to some kind  of manslaughter thing.  Maybe she'll cop a plea.  But I don't know.  You can't prove  the kid didn't die  accidentally.  Right, right, right.  And then she just  got rid of an accidentally 
[00:41:00]  killed kid,  which is different  than first degree murder.  So they're having,  I think the prosecution  is still going to have  a hard time.  What's the best case  scenario here?  Best case for her?  Yeah, she goes away  for how long?  A manslaughter rap.  A few years, maybe.  I think even if they do  get a manslaughter rap  or some kind of a,  even just having her  die accidentally,  negligence,  I think they'll hit her  with the maximum  fucking sentence.  What would that be?  I don't know  what the sentencing is.  I don't know  what the sentencing  laws are in that. 
[00:41:30]  She could be.  Sure.  Sure.  And she's, you know,  mid-twenties, so.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  More importantly,  your tweets on the  whole thing are fantastic.  Oh, I can't get enough  of these women  that sit there.  And you know  what it is also?  Headline News,  they've been covering  this trial.  They do like a call-in thing  after the trial  is over for the day.  Yeah.  And every woman  that calls  is exactly like  the women that are  mad at me  for doing what I'm doing,  this tweeting, 
[00:42:00]  because they're like,  I have to say,  she is so guilty.  And it's like,  you know,  fucking,  just some old person's name.  It's Dottie.  We're talking with Dottie  from Kentucky.  She is so,  I've been watching  since the beginning.  And I've got to say,  it was heartbreaking,  heart-wrenching,  watching that grandmother.  Well,  Dottie should go outside  and get some fucking  fresh air.  Oh, please.  Frankie Manhattan,  loving your tweets there.  Frankie. 
[00:42:30]  Good morning,  bu-bu-bu-bu-bu.  Good morning, Frank.  Hello.  Hello.  I just love it, Ant.  I crack up every time  I get a little message  on my BlackBerry.  I get a new tweet.  Because you've made  those women's days.  You've given them  an excuse to be outraged.  Yeah, yeah.  I love it.  I do.  I give them a little bit  of a life.  I've been retweeting  some of the better ones  where they, you know,  really get mad at me.  And one woman said,  do I have mental problems?  Well, of course I do,  but not because of that.  Yeah, it's been fun doing this, 
[00:43:00]  I tell you that much.  Well, the thing that I wonder about,  you must be under a lot of pressure  because some of the stuff,  you're not just being glib  and being an ass.  It's funny as shit, so.  Well, I try.  That's my job.  It's dark humor at its best,  but these women don't want to hear it.  They don't want to read it.  They don't want to read that shit.  Well, you know,  women are just so un-fucking-funny.  Just like with Jimmy's story  in the post yesterday,  I went online and looked at it,  which, Jimmy, by the way,  I'd fuck you if I saw that apartment.  Thank you, sir, very much. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, did you see the woman  that wrote the thing,  like some woman wrote a response to it?  Because it actually got  fucking a lot of play in that article.  That's awesome.  What did she say?  Do we have it?  No, it was nothing terrible,  but it was just like  some response that was  kind of too serious.  I just tweeted something about her.  It's supposed to be a...  Taking it literally.  It's a silly thing.  Yeah, silly, kind of goofy,  kind of, you know,  it's not going to hurt anybody.  Chicks really,  really don't have the ability  to interpret sarcasm.  But it really is.  Like, what would cause you... 
[00:44:00]  That's because that girl  and her friends  never just sat around  and really broke each other's balls  so she doesn't know  what being funny is or sarcasm.  I don't care for that.  Oh, you.  How could you say that?  Exactly.  Yeah.  How could I?  What happened?  I saw that, Jimmy.  I'm sorry to interrupt.  Roberta and Roberta  was very outraged  and said she wouldn't  just give it up.  It was too, you know,  her pussy's just  a little bit too precious.  Oh, I didn't see that one. 
[00:44:30]  That's good.  They're golden pussies.  Give me a break.  Believe me, she would.  Roberta was very outraged, Jimmy.  I just wanted to tell you.  Anybody would.  Management didn't even have  to see that article  and they fucked Jimmy.  Absolutely.  Deep and raw.  And whenever I tried  to put some lube on it,  they damned it with sandpaper  and said,  Oh, no, you don't, bub.  This isn't fun for us  unless you're crying.  And it's not precious  if it just stretches  over and over again.  Yeah, stop.  It's your precious pussies. 
[00:45:00]  It's made for a lot of action.  For those things.  They need the perfect combination.  Yep.  They need the perfect combination  of everything  before they have the,  ooh,  the lovely pussy  makes its appearance.  Speaking of the article,  then they did  a little TV piece, right, Jimmy?  I got it here.  You're on TV  with the whole thing.  Yes, I didn't see it.  With your cum,  with your cum stain  fucking sheets.  I forgot that it was on.  Oh, did you see  the Twitter photo?  The Twitter photo's great.  With your cum stain  on your comforter. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, here's the audio.  Just wipe your dick  on your duvet.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Jimmy's comforter.  It's a comforter.  I know.  It's kind of like  a Frankfurter,  but it's got cum on it.  I just like one  of the comments here.  This guy, Adam,  says brown sheets  really make the cum pop.  Really brings out the cum.  You've got to get  an off-white.  Yeah, you definitely  need an off-white.  Everything just blends in.  Yeah, beige is good. 
[00:46:00]  Right, brown.  Yeah.  But here's the audio  from the TV part  of the whole thing.  An article in today's  New York Post  reveals that the key  to a woman's heart  is through a man's  well-appointed apartment.  Comedian Jim Norton  isn't afraid to admit  that it's his  Trump Tower pad  even more than his charm  that attracts the ladies.  Okay, Jim,  so we are in the kitchen  that you say  you never actually use.  Right.  So why did you  get such a great kitchen?  Because any time 
[00:46:30]  a woman sleeps with me,  it's all smoke and mirrors.  So I figured  if they're in here,  it would give me  the illusion  of being somebody  that's like really good  and can cook.  I've never used  this thing  that you're standing in.  This thing right here.  If a woman is like  kind of on the fence,  if I get a woman here  and she's like,  maybe I will,  maybe I won't,  this sometimes  pushes them over the edge.  I'm under no illusions.  I'm not going to have  Jennifer Lopez walking here.  So I want to go  meet with a broker  and find out  what his take on this is  and if it's actually  happening across the city.  This is her way of saying,  I'm going to go  meet with a broker  to see if you're 
[00:47:00]  the biggest creep  I've ever met in my life  or if there are  other creeps  who are like you.  Exactly.  Oh my God.  Wow, they edited that.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Oh really?  They get it?  Oh my God.  Yeah, I knew  they would cut it down.  Yeah, it was 59 seconds.  Yeah, that was a very...  It was quickie.  Yeah.  Janine's saying,  he's just Jimmy  from the block.  Yes.  That sounded like that.  Don't be fooled  by the sores  that I got.  I'm just Jimmy  from the block. 
[00:47:30]  Remember a little  while ago  we played that guy  from America's Got Talent  Ant?  Yes.  Who never played  for anyone  until last night?  This guy, Rocky.  Yeah, this guy.  In Kansas City  says,  I'm a better singer  than the America's  Got Talent guy.  Really?  Rocky, why do you  say that?  Because I am  Antony.  All right, Rocky.  Well, you still  got the pins  in the map?  Why don't you 
[00:48:00]  give us a little?  Give us a little  acapella version  of a song.  What song  do you like  to sing?  I Walk the Line.  I Walk the Line,  I think he said.  Johnny Cash?  Johnny Cash, yeah.  All right,  why don't you  give us a little?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Watch on this  heart of mine. 
[00:48:30]  I keep my eyes  wide open  all the time.  I keep my ears  down for the  time to bind.  A chef was  fucked up.  Well, you're  better than the  guy from last  night, though.  Yeah, that is  obviously a lot  better.  The acoustics  on the phone  are probably  not helping.  Why aren't  you a professional?  Um, because  I tried on  the Howard Stern  show, and  they said I  fucking sucked.  Really? 
[00:49:00]  They were just  being shock  jocks.  Right.  Yeah, that's  just being  shocking and  stuff.  But you got  some raw  talent there,  my friend.  Sure do.  And, uh,  Mancow  sounded like  a queer.  You just  call radio  shows and  try to sing?  Is that what  you do?  Rocky, you're  trying to do  a bit, because  we've been  around way  too long  to deal with  this show.  I don't  think so.  I think that  he's being  very sincere.  Oh, yeah, he's  being absolutely  sincere.  I believe this  guy.  Have you  sang for  Bubba?  Who else 
[00:49:30]  have you  called?  No, I  have sung for  Bubba, but  I call your  show because I  have four of  your t-shirts.  I got the  pig fat shirt.  I got the  pet shirt.  Oh.  I wear out  here.  Maybe he's not  doing it.  This jockey's out  here hate me  because I  called her show  and fucking  pissed them  off.  You just  call out  radio shows,  huh?  Yeah.  Is that what  you do?  Thank you guys.  Well, do you  want him to sing  more Johnny  Keshe?  Yeah, what  other song  do you know?  I want to  hear Johnny  Keshe.  Sing something  with a little  more range.  Huh?  I know 
[00:50:00]  about  full  person  blues.  Alright, let's  hear that.  Okay, I  hear a  train  coming  and it's  rolling  around  It hit  him.  I  ain't  seen  the  sunshine  since  I  don't  know  when  I'm  stuck  in  prison  and  time  can  drag  you  on  I  hear  that  wholesome  train  I  hit  my  head  and  cry.  I  messed  up  the  words,  but  yeah,  I  know  the  song  but  I  just  No, 
[00:50:30]  that's  great.  If he  cleaned it  up a  little  bit,  I  think  I  would  like  his  voice.  Cleaned  it up  by  he  means  that  with  a  shotgun  shell.  Oh,  God.  It's a  little  raw.  I  like  that  it's  raw.  Yeah,  it's  raw,  right?  It's  early  in  the  morning.  He's  obviously  on  something  in  my  opinion.  You  know  who he  sings  like?  He  sings  like  fucking  the  kid  from  My  Bodyguard  who  kept  getting  his  lunch  flushed  out  of 
[00:51:00]  the  job.  Oh,  that  kid.  Oh,  right.  Yeah.  You're dead  fucker.  That's what he  sounds like.  All right,  Rocky.  Thank you,  guys.  Oh,  that guy  from  News Radio?  Yeah.  Talk Radio.  Hey,  one more.  Yeah.  I got one  more.  Yeah.  Howard used  to call  me  Special Ed.  He used  to call  me the  most stupid  guy to  call  a show.  Well,  I guess  that title.  No,  he's not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not  going to be  the stupidest  guy to  call our  show. 
[00:51:30]  You're not  even in  the top  10.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I mean,  I would  be if  you guys  wanted me  to.  No,  we don't  do fake  radio.  If you  just happen  to be  stupid  and you  call us,  then we  would go  with you.  You're stupid  if you enjoy  the show,  but you're  not in the  top 10  stupidest  people we've  ever had  call.  I know  there's  people out  there that  fake shit,  but we  don't like  faking shit.  Yeah,  I have a  Facebook if  you guys  want to.  No,  why not?  Give him  some fucking  followers today.  Go ahead,  Rocky.  Okay,  my Facebook 
[00:52:00]  is Rocky  Graves.  I'm from  originally from  Belton,  Missouri.  Rocky Dennis.  I didn't hear  his last name.  Exactly.  Rocky Graves.  Graves.  Graves?  Yeah.  T-R-A-V.  Is that  your real  last name?  Yeah.  That's  fucking  creepy.  Yeah.  Rocky Graves.  What?  Your parents  were either...  I think  your parents  were sick.  Yeah.  Rocky Graves.  Did they  think that  was funny? 
[00:52:30]  Hey,  Rocky Graves  here.  Right.  What are  you doing?  Rocky Graves  on your  Monday morning.  I hate  to say  this,  guys.  My dad  is a big  Mancalf fan.  That's  good for him.  So am I.  I give  great calls  to that  show,  apparently.  W-A-M.  All right,  Rocky Graves  with you.  We got to  go.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right,  can we play  Walk the Line  at the break?  I would like  to hear that  today,  if you have  it there,  E-Rock.  And we'll  continue to  stay there.  Oh,  yeah.  I keep a close 
[00:53:00]  watch on this  heart of mine.  I keep my  eyes wide  open all  the time.  I keep  the ends 
[00:53:30]  out for  the tie  that binds  because  you're mine.  I walk  the line.  I  find  it  very,  very  easy  to be  true.  I find  myself  alone  when each  day's  through.  Yes,  I'll  admit  that I'm  a fool  for you  because 
[00:54:00]  you're  mine.  I walk  the line.  As sure  as night  is dark  and day  is light,  I keep  you on  my mind  both day  and night.  And happiness  I've known  proves that  it's right  because  you're  mine.  I walk 
[00:54:30]  the line.  You've got  a way  to keep  me on  your side.  You give  me cause  for love  that I  can't hide.  For you  I know  I'd even  try to  turn the  tide  because  you're  mine.  I walk  the line. 
[00:55:00]  I keep  a close  watch  on this  heart  of mine.  I keep  my eyes  wide  open  all the  time.  I keep  the ends  out  for the  tide  it  binds  because  you're  mine.  I walk  the line. 
[00:55:30]  Sirius XM  The Virus  The Opie  and Anthony  Show  I was just  talking to  Jim Norton.  Hangover 2  had a song  that I thought  was by  Johnny Cash.  It's called  The Beast  in Me  I think.  And Jimmy  you haven't  heard of that  Johnny Cash  song.  I have  not  known.  And so  we're  looking at  me and 
[00:56:00]  Danny  and it  turns out  it's  it's  not  Johnny Cash  singing it.  Yeah.  And it's  Mark Lanigan  a guy I  really do  like.  You know  you remember  Mark.  I thought  it was  Heidi  Klum.  Oh  it was a  racist joke.  It's  a black  guy that  she's married  to.  He's  really  dark.  I didn't  say shit.  I love  how you  say you  didn't  say shit.  I'll say  this.  Like people  are stupid  out there.  That was  so fast. 
[00:56:30]  It wasn't  even funny.  It was  so fast  that no  one could  process that  joke in  time.  Wow.  That was  quick.  Are the  covers not  in the  lights?  All right.  Fuck it.  That's a  damn good  one.  I'm going  to stop  right there  then.  Fuck it.  Mark  Lanigan was  the lead  singer of  Screaming  Trees.  I guess  they still  do a  little  of that.  He's  got a  great  fucking  voice but  never had  mainstream  success but  very respected.  He does  the cover of  this Johnny  Cash song 
[00:57:00]  that I  think it  opens up  Hangover  to or  pretty close  to that.  Wow.  What a  fucking  great song.  What's the  original?  Do we have  the original  even?  How about  this?  Find the  original  you're  fired.  Damn  it.  The  original's  not in  Dillette  either.  Oh  wow.  Huh.  That  Dillette.  I know.  Doesn't do  anything.  Exactly.  It's not  even a good  razor.  That's the  knockoff.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's what 
[00:57:30]  retards shave  with.  This is an  Onega.  You don't  have it there.  Oh my God.  Woo.  You don't  have it  E.  Iraq.  Just found  it.  All right.  Here's the  original.  Oh.  But Mark  Lonegan doing  it in Hangover  too.  I was all  in. 
[00:58:00]  But is  Iraq doing  something wrong?  No he's not  doing anything  wrong.  It's just  painful when  you have to  sit here.  You know  millions of  people are  just waiting.  The beast  in me  is caged  by frail  and fragile  bars  restless by  day  and by  night  rants  and rages  and rages  at the 
[00:58:30]  stars  God help  the beast  in me  All right.  And now you  got Lonegan  doing it?  This sounds  like later  Johnny Cash.  It does sound  later, right?  I wonder if this  is Johnny's  Cash and Strong  or did he do  a cover?  I don't know.  Here's Mark  Lonegan doing it.  Love  Nazareth.  The beast  in me  That's  versus  Cooper. 
[00:59:00]  This  cage by  frail  and fragile  bars  Good boy  foe  Restless  by day  and by  night  Rants  and rages  at the  stars  That's  true.  God  help  the beast  in me  We're not  to play  He reminds  me of Leonard  Cohen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  It is  murder. 
[00:59:30]  Boy, did  he get  fucking  raped  financially.  Really?  Yeah, he  did.  He was  like with  this girl  and like  his girlfriend  and he  went away  he just  wanted to  give everything  up and  go on this  quest  and he  had like  eight million  or something.  Yeah.  Trusted her.  Trusted her.  Oops.  He spent it  all.  And then he  came back  and he  was money  hit the  one tour  to pay  for his  fucking  Wow.  Yep.  That's bad.  The beast  in me  was from  American  Recordings  1994.  Johnny Cash.  Was it an  original or  was it a  remake?  American  Recordings  were all 
[01:00:00]  covers I  believe.  No, he  did a few  originals.  Oh, there  you go.  I really  don't know  but that's  Mark  Lanigan.  That fucking  guy knows  how to  sing, man.  Holy shit.  Are you  guys still  queers?  You bet.  You still  believing in  the wiener  or what?  Wow.  Some new  details coming  out.  You guys  weren't as  suspicious as  I was  yesterday.  I was  under the  impression  that what  he said  was true  that his  Twitter got  hacked.  It's not  out of the  realm of  possibility.  That's for  sure. 
[01:00:30]  But some  new things.  He's getting  very defensive  about this.  He's hired  a lawyer to  handle this.  And it  turns out the  people that he  was following  on Twitter,  a little  suspect.  There's a  lot of  women and  some porn  stars and  whatnot.  Well, he  used to follow  Ginger Lynn.  He sent her a  private message  one time.  Yeah, this  wiener guy.  But he 
[01:01:00]  follows a lot  of political  people, too.  But a few  hot chicks.  Yeah, but if  you're in  politics, you  got to be  really careful  who you're  following on  Twitter.  But he  could be.  He strikes  me as one  of these  dummies who  wouldn't  understand how  easily this  could get  out.  Right.  He follows  Lady Fox  Fire.  Fire spelled  F-Y-R-E.  Of course  it is.  He follows  Kitten X 
[01:01:30]  Poker.  He follows  Firm  Denny  Tracy  and a few  other  vixens.  Some  vixens.  Yes.  Wiener's  vixens.  He follows  me, which  is weird.  He does?  No, he  doesn't.  He does?  If it  follows you?  No.  Would be  cool.  So, what  do you think?  Did he send  the pic?  It's  starting to  look like  he might  have plumped  up and  taken that 
[01:02:00]  pic and  sent it,  but why  the hell  would you  do that?  Kind of  safe?  And maybe  someone  recognizes  those  underwear.  Is he  married?  Is he?  Yes.  His wife  knows the  truth.  Knows the  underwear.  And you  know those  wives of  these  politicians.  Yeah.  They keep  their traps  shut always,  but she  knows either  way if  it was  him.  If it  was him.  He might  have tried  to give  her a  direct 
[01:02:30]  message and  kind of  put it in  the wrong  spot and  hit send.  You've got  to be careful  of that.  I think so,  yeah.  Maybe he  was going  to send  her a  direct and  it went  out.  And once  it's out  for  everybody,  he couldn't  take it  off of you  to act  like it  was just  hacked.  I wonder  if he  realized  as soon  as he  sent  it,  like,  but you  can't  stop it.  You're  praying for  your service  to be  cut out.  Yeah,  yeah.  You'll see that  bar going  and you  send and 
[01:03:00]  you realize  you sent  the wrong  text to  the wrong.  And you  just know  it's like,  there's no  taking that  back.  It's going,  it's going,  and you're  like,  once in a  while it  won't send.  There should  be an  atom bomb  button where  you could  just stop  everything  you're doing  in its  tracks.  Right on the  phone.  Wham,  right there.  You press  it.  That would  be a  great app.  That app  would do  well.  It just  sounds like  this,  this,  this.  That's all  it does.  This,  this,  this,  this.  But you're  right,  that would  be a  great,  an atom bomb  button would  be fucking  great.  Yeah,  just bomb  whatever the  fuck you  just put  out there. 
[01:03:30]  Well,  Wiener,  Wiener,  he's getting  more and more  popular locally,  right?  Is he?  Anthony Wiener's  kind of on  his way up.  He just looks like a  dork,  though.  Go for him.  on his show  about it,  and he was  kind of being  kind.  Right.  You know,  I guess they're  pals.  Well,  Wiener was at  a press  conference,  and wow.  Well,  have you heard  this yet?  Yeah.  I heard he was  cranky,  but I didn't  hear the audio  cranky. 
[01:04:00]  He was  cranky and just  denied,  denied,  denied,  denied.  Congressman,  just answer  point blank.  You say that  you were hacked,  which is  potentially a  crime.  So why  haven't you  asked the  Capitol Police  or any  law enforcement  to investigate?  Look,  this was  a prank  that I've  now been  talking about  for a couple  of days.  I'm not  going to  allow it  to decide  what I  talk about  for the  next week  or the  next two  weeks.  And so  I'm not  going to be  giving anything  more about  that today.  I think  I've been  pretty responsive  to in the past.  But with  respect, 
[01:04:30]  you're here.  Does he have  control of his  Twitter still?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess he  sent it.  What,  someone hacked  it and then  put back his  password?  And then gave  up.  Or whatever?  He's  got it back.  My opinion is  he's lying  through his  fucking dumb  teeth.  Which again,  you're a guy.  But that  fucking question  she asked is  a fair question.  Why haven't  you put the  Capitol Police  on it?  You gotta  just,  if you did  it stupid,  you should  have just  confessed it  because there's  too many  fucking follow-up  questions.  This is what  you shit  politicians get 
[01:05:00]  for moralizing  with the rest  of us.  He's trying  to play it  both ways  because then  it would be  a problem  the other  way if he  did call  the Capitol  Police  knowing that  he actually  did it.  Because it  sounds like  a good  excuse.  I got hacked  but then  you forget  that everything's  traceable.  And under  a microscope  when you're  a politician  they trace  everything.  Oh yeah,  they want  to find  shit.  So they're  gonna dig,  dig,  dig.  Why didn't  you call  the Capitol  Police?  Because it's  a crime.  That's a  very fair  question.  And the  media is  terrible,  but that's  a fair 
[01:05:30]  question.  I said  that three  times.  We heard  you.  Before we  go back  to that,  I gotta  go to  this guy.  John  in Staten  Island.  John.  Do I need  to be  heard?  Johnny.  What if  you throw  this phone  in the  toilet  when it's  sending?  All right.  Let's say  the phone  is sending,  you see a  little bar  moving,  and you  just throw  the phone  in the  toilet.  Then you  make a  shitty call.  Oh,  you.  Unfortunately,  you're not  near a  toilet every  time.  I know. 
[01:06:00]  But what  if you just  slammed it  down on  the sidewalk?  As hard as  you could,  you smash  it on the  ground.  Or if  you're  driving in  texting,  you just  throw it  out the  window and  hope the  impact  fucking  stops  sending  it.  Could it?  I don't  know.  Imagine how  you'd feel  just like  having to  just...  I gotta.  I gotta.  I gotta.  I just  gotta.  That was  meant to  be a  PM,  not a  fucking  tweet.  I gotta  try  something  here.  Back  to  Wiener.  You're  here,  which we  appreciate, 
[01:06:30]  but you're  not answering  the questions.  Can you  just say  why you  haven't  asked  law  enforcement  to  investigate  what you  alleging  isn't...  You know,  Dana,  if I was  giving a  speech to  45,000  people,  and someone  in the back  of the room  threw a pie  or yelled  out an  insult,  would I  spend the  next two  hours responding  to that?  No.  I would get  back.  I would get  back.  This is not  that situation.  I would get  back.  Well,  what did  you do?  You want  to do the  briefing?  Do you  want to  do the  briefing, 
[01:07:00]  sir?  From your  Twitter account,  a nude photograph  was sent to  a college student.  Answer the  question.  Was it  from you?  Sir?  Permit me.  Do you  guys want me  to finish?  Oh,  boy.  Wow.  Why would he  have a press  conference?  Oh, is he  fucking just...  He's stammering.  Oh, and that  guy, the guy  sounds like an  asshole, but  that's...  Yeah, but...  He's got you,  man.  Why would it  come from your  account?  Why?  Put a schnozzola  on him.  Do you  remember when...  He should have 
[01:07:30]  put fucking  underwear over  his nose.  Would have  looked bigger.  That fucking  bulge is  humiliating.  That little...  Who would  send that?  Those fucking  nappy  underwears.  Yeah.  The...  When Sarah  Palin got  hacked, you  remember her  email got  hacked?  She was  fucking  livid.  They prosecuted  the guy.  Like, she  was...  You knew she  had been  hacked.  She was  fuming.  And she  was vocal  about it.  And why  didn't he  say, during  that questioning,  just, no, it's 
[01:08:00]  not me.  It was  hacked.  We're  looking into  it.  Anything  else?  Because he  can't.  Anything else?  Because he  can't.  He's got to  stay right on  the fucking  fence.  None of them  want to say  that they're  lying, but I  think he's  lying.  Because some  are saying it's  a felony if  he called in the  crime and was  guilty.  So he can't do  that.  I think he  meant to send a  private message.  And here you go.  Fast forward a few  weeks.  I asked for  your privacy so  I can tend to  my family.  Family. 
[01:08:30]  I need to be  with my family.  And I apologize to  my wife and  everyone who put  their faith in  me.  John Stewart had a  great joke.  He obviously leans  hard to the left.  That is a good  one.  That is good.  You can see  like an outline of  the head of his  cock.  His mushroom.  His shroom.  Why would you  send that?  It's a close up.  It's a dumb  photo.  That is dumb.  Nice legs,  dick.  But they are  kind of unique  undies.  So the wife  would know.  Wife knows either  way.  If she puts  those undies in  the warsh, she 
[01:09:00]  knows.  She's washed  out the shit  stains in those  underwear.  If there's a  little pre right  by the leg.  Here comes the  pre.  Oh, that is  so cool.  We'll get to  that later.  What a dope  piece.  You saw the  town, right?  Yes.  What a great  movie.  Oh, yeah,  yeah.  They copied  the end.  Bank robbers  actually reenacted  it in Chicago.  They get away  with it?  Exact same  fucking mask.  They got away  with it?  I don't know.  I haven't read  the whole thing  yet.  It's like,  wow, we got  to see.  Back to  Wiener. 
[01:09:30]  Bank robbery.  Permit me.  Do you guys  want me to  finish my answer?  Yes.  No.  Did you send  it or not?  If I were  giving a speech,  what do you  have?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's a yes or  no question.  It's a yes or no  question.  No, yes.  Wiener.  That's not a long  answer.  Wiener dog.  Wiener dog.  Do you think he  would accept this  answer if he was  sitting on a  fucking subcommittee  asking somebody  something?  Answer the  question, sir.  That's what he'd  be.  Go on.  Answer the  question, sir. 
[01:10:00]  Did you or did  you not send  the picture?  Well, I was  a dick.  I love when  these guys get  in fucking  trouble.  I love it.  It's on every  TV right now,  too.  Oh, he's  fucking easy.  Twitter scandal,  they're calling it.  A college student,  too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huge bosoms.  Yeah.  You fucking  shouldn't do that  fucking college.  Yeah, but wrong  color for you,  man.  I'm sorry.  What?  Is she a darker  girl?  A light skin  black.  A girl of a 
[01:10:30]  darker of a  mocha complexion,  perhaps?  Did you send it  or not?  If I were giving  a speech to  45,000 people  and someone in  the back threw  a pie or yelled  out an insult,  I would not spend  the next two hours  of my speech  responding to  that pie or  that insult.  I would return  to the things  that I want to  talk about to  the audience.  All you have  to do is see.  And that is  what I intend  to do.  All you have  to do is see.  Let me start 
[01:11:00]  this question.  The woman who  allegedly got  this tweet  or was directed  to a 21-year-old  college student  in Seattle,  she released  a statement  to the New York  Daily News  yesterday saying  that you follow  her on Twitter.  Is that true?  Did you follow  her on Twitter?  And if so,  how did you find  her?  What was the  reason?  You know,  I have,  I think,  said this a  couple of weeks.  I love this  guy.  How many followers  does he have?  Almost 50,000.  So he pretty  much follows  anyone that  follows?  No.  Then it would  be understandable.  I mean, 
[01:11:30]  how many people  does he follow?  150 or something?  Oh, boy,  this guy.  Right,  Travis,  could you look  it up?  This is so  fucking telling.  Oh, he's trolling.  He's guilty.  He's trolling.  Anthony Wiener's  tweets are protected.  He's got his  hook in the letter.  It's Rep Wiener.  Yeah,  yeah,  Rep Wiener.  Oh, boy.  Because,  I mean,  it would be a good  excuse if he's  following thousands  and thousands.  That means he's  just following anyone  that follows him.  That does happen  from time to time.  What's his last  tweet?  God help me. 
[01:12:00]  Suck it,  bitch.  Oops.  Let's remember  the debt limit  vote is to  continue to pay  the Bush debt.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  How about your  Bush debt?  Let's hope  the markets  get this  gap.  It's all like  bullshit.  Political crap.  Who wants  the Canucks  to win?  Canucks in five.  That's good.  Who wants  the Canucks  in five?  I'm Bruins  all the way. 
[01:12:30]  Gotta go  Bruins.  Watching  Sports Center.  Puzzle  me this.  Can you  adapt  a track  to run  laps  clockwise?  Leans hard  to the left.  That's a great  joke.  Oh, my God.  God damn it.  You didn't have  confidence in it,  though.  And in all  this political  shit was  just hidden  the gem  of his  cock?  Yep.  Oh, that's  wonderful.  Because you  get bored  out of your  mind reading  this shit,  so.  No shit.  But you read  between the lines  and there might  be some  cock shit in 
[01:13:00]  there.  If you follow  the young  ladies,  200 people  and say 50  of them are  30 of them  are hot  women.  The other  ones are  just giving  you plausible  deniability.  Yeah.  That's why  you're following  them.  I understand  that it's a  direct link  to fucking  hot chicks.  I get it.  you're a  politician.  You know,  it's  exactly  ticker  tackley  what he  should have  done if  he wasn't  so stupid  is is done  it from  another computer  or whatever  and then  fucking  changed his  password like  it had been  hacked. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they  could probably  look that up  and figure out  he was at  the it's  just there's  no covering  this up  anymore.  Did he  send it to  Cordova?  Is that her  name?  Cordova.  How has she  been affected?  Well,  obviously she's  probably going  to say mental  damage and  everything and  sue him.  I have no  idea.  I know.  Who is that  bitch?  Oh,  the spotlight's  taking a toll  on her.  Oh,  boy,  I'm pretty 
[01:14:00]  sick right  now and it's  only getting  worse with  the stress.  Get the  fuck out of  here.  You're getting  a shitload  of followers,  man.  She even  dropped her  journalism class.  Oh,  boy.  Oh,  boy.  Journalism.  Cordova is  very,  very bothered  by this.  Poor girl.  I was  stunned at  just how  fast the  story spread.  Think she'll  sue him?  Oh,  yeah.  There's  something going  on here.  I love how  he is just  fucking  shucking and  jiving trying  to get.  That's her?  Wow. 
[01:14:30]  She's got  some ampels.  Yeah,  she's kind  of...  Amply.  She looks  like Tahitian  or something.  She doesn't  look like  completely...  Tahitian?  I don't know,  something going  on there.  How did you  find her?  What was  the reason?  You know,  I have,  I think,  said this a  couple of  ways and  I'll say  it again.  I am not  going to  permit myself  to be  distracted by  this issue  any longer.  All you have  to do is  say no to  politicians  just can't  answer 
[01:15:00]  fucking  questions.  The most  hateable people  on the planet.  They never  answer tough  questions ever.  This is a  great exercise.  And the  media,  that guy  is asking  why don't  you just  say no  to the  question.  All he  has to  say is  I didn't  send that.  Wasn't me.  Wasn't me,  but he can't  because it  is him.  That's the  only reason.  What a  fucking  creep.  He knows  that.  That would  be the  headline  everywhere.  I did  not do  this.  Deny it.  If it  wasn't you,  deny it.  Boom.  Let me  hear what  he said  there at  the end.  I love  that. 
[01:15:30]  At the  end,  this goes  on for  another  minute.  Oh, good.  Yay.  Goody  gumdrops.  I am  not going  to permit  myself to  be distracted  by this  issue any  longer.  All you  have to  do is  say no  to that  question.  You're  very good  at it.  Why don't  you let  me do  the answers  and you  do the  questions?  As soon  as you  answer  the  question  and  ask  you,  sir,  we  will.  By the  way,  in  related  news, 
[01:16:00]  why would  you put  yourself in  this situation?  This dummy  thought he  could handle  this.  What an idiot  reader.  He's  not going  to allow  himself to  be  distracted.  What the  press is  saying right  there is  all you  have to  do is  say no.  Just answer  that question  and they'll  move on to  the budget  or whatever  the fuck  else he  wants to  talk about.  But as  long as  he keeps  hemming  and hawing,  they're going  to keep  pounding him  with this  fucking  topic.  Why are you  following so  many women 
[01:16:30]  on Twitter?  I've noticed  you're following  a lot of  young women  on Twitter.  I'm from  youngsnatch.com  and I want  youngsnatch.  They just  came out of  the woodwork.  Why was he  doing this  press conference?  Not for  this.  Because that  would be  the dumbest  thing ever.  Was there  something else  going on?  Some budget  thing.  Is there  a reason  I got to  hear that?  I got to  hear his  voice.  Why would  you follow  so many  young women? 
[01:17:00]  His voice  is terrible.  It's horrible.  The question  asked you,  sir, we  will.  You're  following  a lot of  young women  on Twitter.  Is there  a reason  that you  have so  many ladies  that you're  following on?  By the way,  in related  news, I  have in  the famous  hashtag  Scrappy  Chasing  Crazy, I  passed  Michelle Bachman  today the  number of  Twitter followers.  I will give  you that  additional  fact.  Is that a  result of this  of this?  Unfortunately,  it probably  is.  Obama  Roo.  Wow.  He forgot  the tss, tss. 
[01:17:30]  Obama  Roo.  Because they  hate you.  You can't do  that joke  after you've  just evaded  all their  answers.  No one is  going to laugh  at your joke  when you've  not given  them one  answer.  They're mad  at you,  dummy.  You're not  going to get  a chuckle.  Yeah.  Casey  Anthony would  get a bigger  laugh right now  if she did a  little patent  leather shoe  joke, Roo.  Well, you  know, there's  always that  extra room to  put stuff in. 
[01:18:00]  A rotting  child in the  trunk joke.  Or if she  did a  repaint the  fucking room  joke and  then looked  at them  like,  huh?  Yes.  Her child  was spoiled  rotten.  I'll have  to tweet  that later.  I didn't  know whether  to say  terrible or  tremendous  and I  went  trammeled. 
[01:18:30]  I just  made  noises.  Terrendous.  An additional  fact.  Is that a  result of this  right?  Unfortunately,  it probably  is.  Congress,  my congress,  you understand  what's going  on here,  the frustration.  We appreciate  you coming  out and  you're talking  to us.  You're smiling,  you're cooperating  and that gives  good optics,  but you're not  answering the  question.  So can you  answer the  most basic  question?  This is now  day three.  You have  statements that  my office has 
[01:19:00]  put out.  There are  statements that  my office has  put out and  there are going  to be people  who are going  to want to  look,  this is the  tactic.  The guy in  the back of  the room  who's throwing  the pie or  yelling out  the insult  wants that  to be the  conversation.  This fucking  asshole.  The pie thing  doesn't work.  It's a dumb  analogy.  It's a cannoli.  It's a small  cannoli.  I hope they  destroy him.  He's hateable. 
[01:19:30]  He's hateable,  right?  What a fucking  hateable,  smarmy,  cunt politician.  put out statements.  Well, yeah,  but your statements  don't answer the  question.  That's why we're  here, you  idiot.  He's being so  evasive.  She fucking  penned him  with that.  Like, we  understand you  being cooperative.  We appreciate  that, but you're  not my office,  and that didn't  answer the question  either.  Fuck you.  This is where  they have the  right to fucking  murder this guy.  I want them  answered immediately.  That's going to be  the conversation.  I am the one who 
[01:20:00]  said it was hacked  and you were hacked.  And that's a  criminal potential.  Dana, let me,  I'm going to have to  ask him to follow  some rules here.  And one of them  is going to be  a U.S. person.  I do the answers.  That's reasonable.  I'd love to get an  answer.  That would be  reasonable.  You do the questions.  I do the answers  and this jackass  interrupts me.  How about that  as the rule of the  game?  Wow.  Oh, he's so mad.  What a fucking baby.  Get on to him.  Why does it end  there?  Well, it kind of  doesn't.  It goes on and on,  but I didn't want to  hand you a CD of  like eight minutes  of, I don't know, 
[01:20:30]  but.  Yeah, is there more  of that?  In a way, this is  good work.  This is a gem.  This could work.  Yeah, because I love  that they will not  let it go.  And he will not  fucking answer.  Right.  All he's got to do  is say, look,  here's my statement.  I want to move on  to the business at hand.  So here it is.  That wasn't me  in the picture.  I did not send  a tweet to that  that girl and  we're investigating  it or or if  the or if the  statement that his  office put out  said that, too,  he could go, look, 
[01:21:00]  my my office put  out a statement.  What was the  office statement?  What was it?  Obviously, it was  very vague.  It's a shitty pie  thing like, you  know, if somebody  in the back gave  me a pie and I  took a bite out  of it and I got  thinner, you wouldn't  keep asking me why  I lost weight, would  you know,  politicians are so  hateable, dude.  Hateable.  Fucking Sarah  Palin did pizza  with Donald Trump  a block from where  you where we're  broadcasting.  And Stanley, if  someone had a pie. 
[01:21:30]  And she's hateable,  too.  She's not going to be  the next president of  the United States of  America.  And she most likely  isn't even going to  fucking run in the  end.  I think she's  hateable, but I  don't think, at  least at this point,  there's been any big  lies.  I don't think she's a  liar.  No, I don't.  But she's playing  everybody.  She's playing  everybody.  Trump is annoying.  Why would Trump  have pizza with  Sarah Palin?  To get his face on  fucking television.  That guy is such a  media whoolie. 
[01:22:00]  He knows how to  market himself.  But also, people  want to see how they  look together.  People, they want to  see what the reaction  is of Trump and  Palin together.  Well, that's what  they want everyone to  think, that this could  be a possible ticket.  It's not ever going  to happen.  She cannot fucking be  on the Republican  ticket.  It did not work last  time.  I know it wasn't the  only issue.  She cost him the  election.  But, you know, they  got to capitalize on  this, on Obama's 
[01:22:30]  core, kind of  abandoning him.  Can I say something  that's probably going to  cost me when I  status on this show?  Oh.  What happened?  I kind of want Obama  to win again.  Why?  No, I'm, that  doesn't hurt me.  No, I know, but I'm  sitting close to his  trigger finger.  But why?  I don't, I just,  because we've had  eight years of  Republicans.  I just like the  balance.  And I like, I like 
[01:23:00]  socially the stuff  Obama's doing a lot  more than I did  Bush with stem  cells.  Oh, see, that's  stuff I like.  But now, now look,  I don't want  Obama to win,  that's for sure.  But I want a  Republican in there  that isn't a  right-wing religious  Republican.  I don't like that  shit.  I want somebody a  little in there  that's a little more  moderate with things  like stem cell  research and  abortions, things  like that.  But, yeah, but  to have Obama in  there another four  years, oh my  God, please. 
[01:23:30]  Did you see the  fucking front page  of Drudge yesterday?  Enough already.  Talk about fucking  going crazy.  With Libya?  Yeah, Libya.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  With Liberia, this  whole fucking  country, turning  into Liberia.  You're blaming  Obama for that?  Yes.  No.  No.  Yeah, I am  blaming the climate  of this country is  based on its  leadership and this  now entitlement and  I'm going to get you  back and gives me  that bullshit that's  going on in this  country.  That's why half 
[01:24:00]  of Drudge's page  yesterday and the  headline was  youths, just  youths gone wild.  And by youths, they  mean black people  going crazy.  Obviously annoying,  but to blame Obama,  really?  Part of the problem.  I see the leadership  of this country as  part of the problem.  When you had all  those headlines  yesterday of these  crowds going crazy,  all black, crowds  going crazy, fighting,  shootings, stabbings, 
[01:24:30]  rapings, robberies  all over the country  on Memorial Day.  And then underneath  it, the first other  story that wasn't  that was Obama  pushing for some  type of investigations  into inner city  police abuse and  how Newark Police  Department, the Newark  Police Department is  being investigated for  racial bias and  racial profiling after  they showed a  fucking list of  nothing but black  people going  bullshit crazy all 
[01:25:00]  over the country.  People couldn't go  to a water park  because goddamn  people jumping the  fence, throwing  carriages and  babies over the  fucking fence so  they could get in  for free for some  gives me that water  rides.  Fuck you.  And then Obama's  sitting there with  his stupid fucking  attorney general  sitting there fucking  talking about how  how the police  departments in the  inner cities have to  be more sensitive.  that's just  perpetuating this  shit.  Start racking  heads. 
[01:25:30]  Here's the  water park story.  We can't get in.  It's cold.  Memorial Day at  Wave Country got as  heated as the  temperature outside.  Why we can't get in?  Why we can't get in?  Why we can't get in?  Why we can't?  How about why can't  we get in?  Start with that.  Well, they're poor.  Why we can't get in?  If they're poor, then  don't go to the  fucking water park.  It was an unruly  crowd at the gate  that kept anyone  from getting into 
[01:26:00]  the metro park  early Monday  afternoon.  We couldn't get  the crowd outside  to settle down,  to get in line,  to quit jumping  the fences.  Folks did whatever  they could to get  into Wave Country.  Not just kids  jumping the fence,  but adults with  children and strollers  and putting them  over the fence  and then jumping  the fence.  It was chaotic.  It was chaotic.  Back up!  Back up!  Please, back up!  Nearly two dozen  officers from across  the city showed up  to try and keep  the peace outside  the gates.  On the other side,  visitors say 
[01:26:30]  it got dangerous.  Hundreds of people  were just jumping  over the fence,  trampled,  almost trampled  my kid.  I just didn't feel  safe.  Several fights  inside didn't add  to any sense  of security.  That way!  That way!  Once we got  to the point  that the turmoil  at the front  of the facility  also got inside  the facility,  we felt for  everyone's safety  the best thing  to do was to  close.  See, for  everyone's safety  the best thing  to do was to  close the park.  But Obama?  So they had to  close the park. 
[01:27:00]  That's what I'm  shocked at.  I am getting  back, yeah,  because it's  making a climate  in this country  where people are  getting away  with everything.  I heard more  of that statement  by the way,  and the owner  of the park  and other people,  patrons,  were saying  this hasn't  happened before.  We've had  bigger crowds  with no problems.  What crowds?  Bigger crowds  with no problems.  And they can't  address the fact 
[01:27:30]  that the problems  were caused  by black people  jumping the fence  and starting trouble  once they got  inside the park.  But you can't  address that.  And why can't you?  Why can't you say  there's a problem  with these people  that are coming in  and they're like,  they're investigating  and trying to figure out  how they can  alleviate this type  of problem  and keep it from  happening in the future.  Well,  then you can't  bus in  a bunch of  inner city black people  to start trouble  in your fucking 
[01:28:00]  water park.  But you can't say that.  But that's the problem.  I do agree with you.  But I don't blame  that on Obama, though.  I blame the climate  that causes this shit,  that's been causing  this shit,  that this shit  has been  been building  and building  since Obama  got in office.  There's this entitlement.  It's an entitlement.  It's a,  I'm impervious  to fucking  getting in trouble  for doing things.  I'm not talking about  murder and robbery  and shit like that.  But just these  flash mobs 
[01:28:30]  going into stores  and stealing shit,  jumping the fence  at a water park,  just general  fucking shenanigans  and fighting  and just,  it's a climate  of impunity  that is going on  in the black community  these days  and it's causing  shit like  this Nashville problem,  the Boston problem  at the beaches,  the problems  in Florida,  the problems  at Myrtle Beach,  the problems  at fucking Charlotte,  the problems,  there were fucking,  so many fights 
[01:29:00]  and shootings  and robberies  and rapes  and general shenanigans.  But don't they deserve  to be cool as well?  Yeah,  they just want to cool off.  So you know what you do?  It's a hot day.  Alright,  you're right.  Here's what you do.  You stand on your fucking line,  you don't cut and shove,  you don't knife a guy  that stepped on your foot  and you wait on line,  you pay to get the fuck in,  you don't jump the fence  and tell your buddy  to go long  as you heave your fucking baby  over the fence  like a pass.  Jamar wants in badly.  Oh, Jamar. 
[01:29:30]  Hi, Jamar.  Welcome aboard.  Well, he's confused  by the Obama part of this,  something, I think.  Jamar, go ahead.  Anthony, calm down.  I was so proud of you yesterday  because I actually thought  you came around a little bit,  but I have a homework  excitement for you.  Yeah.  Tonight,  just go out  and find a news article  about something positive  about us.  We're not,  and trust me,  we're trying to separate ourselves  from those niggas too.  I saw something positive.  There was a wonderful story 
[01:30:00]  about a female pilot.  And how she,  you know,  came up through the ranks  and became a pilot,  a wonderful African-American woman  and became a pilot.  And, you know,  that was a nice story.  There you go.  There's one person  and I watched thousands,  thousands of youths  running around  like fucking maniacs.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Yeah.  For all those,  for all those artists...  You're going to find all the time 
[01:30:30]  to do this.  It's all night long.  It's all night.  I'm obsessed.  Are you?  Yeah.  Jamar, hold on.  Yes.  Ant, there's never going to be a moment.  I understand Ant's anger.  I really do get it.  Yes.  But there's never going to be that moment  where it all makes sense.  But just that moment,  but there's never going to be that moment of,  do you see what I'm saying?  There's never going to be that moment  where you're right  and the people you're talking about  see you're right.  It's just one long...  It's like a giant piss  that just doesn't end. 
[01:31:00]  I don't...  So why do it to yourself?  You're never going to have that...  That's what I'm saying.  Aha!  Moment.  It never comes.  I don't want everybody to say I'm right.  No, but I want a solution  to this fucking problem.  We need a solution to this.  It's being ignored.  People put it...  Drudge.  Drudge had the balls.  Thank God for fucking Drudge  to have the balls  to list every fucking racial crime  that was going on  over the Memorial Day weekend  in one spot on his page  with a giant headline saying 
[01:31:30]  fucking gangs running wild in Boston.  Boston, for fuck's sake!  We lost Boston!  We got that story.  Extra patrols are not needed  at just a Little League field,  so Memorial Day weekend brawls  involving hundreds and hundreds  of teenagers...  Teenagers!  ...have state police  doing the same thing  at Carson Beach  in South Boston.  And as Diana Perez explains,  troopers and beachgoers  hope this will help curb  the violence.  Violence.  I think it might be useful  for people being more secure.  Tuesday afternoon at Carson Beach, 
[01:32:00]  a different scene  from just one day ago.  Carson Beach.  Police say more than  a thousand unruly teens  flooded the beaches  between South Boston,  Berks and Castle Island.  Unruly teens is the new  fucking word!  Fights broke out,  arrests were made,  and it wasn't the first time  it happened over the long weekend.  Of course.  In fact,  officers arrested five people  from Friday to Monday  for disorderly conduct.  Now state police  are getting proactive  and gearing up  just in case.  Starting today,  they're increasing  uniformed and undercover  officers,  bringing out canine units 
[01:32:30]  and motorcycle officers  to the beach  like the ones that responded  to yesterday's crowds.  Racist, racism.  It'll be a welcome sight,  says dad John Hurley.  Police brutality.  I would think that would  help quell any,  any, you know,  bad seeds  that would  ordinarily come out.  Someone else  that's in support,  one of the very teens  that was at the beach  yesterday.  People just come to the beach  and have a good time.  Nobody wants to fight  all the time.  It's like when you fight,  you ruin other people's  like fun  to be at the beach.  It's like when one person  fights,  everybody got to go now.  Oh really? 
[01:33:00]  A state police major  tells us they're not  expecting any major crowds  tonight.  They say that'll probably  happen closer to the weekend.  As for these new tactics,  they're in place  indefinitely.  Indefinitely.  And these,  this has to be done  because there's a problem.  But no one can really  address the problem.  The problem goes a lot  deeper than needing police  to just be somewhere  to quell the violence.  Where is the violence  coming from?  Why is the violence there?  Why doesn't it stop? 
[01:33:30]  How come when there's  a party that involves  more than 10 fucking people,  you got to read about  a stabbing,  a shooting,  a fight?  Jesus Christ.  Anthony, calm down.  I can't.  I can't.  This country's going to shit.  Country's going to shit.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  For all those parties  and stuff that you have,  it doesn't happen  all the time.  Those are the minority.  Those are the minority.  Tell me about it.  Oh, you mean the minority. 
[01:34:00]  Okay.  Gotcha.  Thought you were agreeing  with me.  Trust me.  We don't like them  as much as you don't like them.  They're a bunch  such a fucking buffoon.  I wasn't raised like that.  My friends weren't raised like that.  And we don't party like that.  Of course.  Of course.  And for us to just go,  you know something,  y'all niggas just go over there  and do what you need to do  and kill off each other  and the smart ones  to make it out,  go ahead and do it.  Instead of just,  stop.  Just stop.  Stop.  You're making yourself 
[01:34:30]  nuttier than you need to be.  Well then,  some real leadership is needed.  Some real leadership is needed  to kick some ass  and fucking not just treat it  like unruly teens.  It's not unruly teens.  It's gangs,  roving gangs  of fucking animals  that are going around  with a complete lack of respect  for everything.  For things people worked for,  for life in general,  for fucking 
[01:35:00]  people's livelihoods,  women,  just everything.  It's just this fucking mentality  that doesn't even seem  fucking civilized.  I can't take it anymore.  Man, point taken,  but is there actual stats  that prove that there's  more unruly teens  since Obama came into office?  I don't know.  I just don't blame Obama.  It's a feeling you get, right?  I'm just saying that...  It's a feeling you get  or do you have research on that?  You have stats.  What do you got?  I'm saying  that there doesn't seem 
[01:35:30]  to be enough repercussions  for these hijinks  that these unruly teens  are getting into.  And I think it has to do  because we have  an attorney general  that is completely fucking  out of the loop  as far as this shit's concerned.  We have a president  that won't even address it.  That as this shit is happening  is holding meetings  on inner city police  and how they need  to be held accountable?  Fuck you. 
[01:36:00]  Racial profiling  is realistic profiling.  I agree.  My only point is  I want him to get re-elected  for things like  gays in the military,  for things like stem cells,  that type of stuff.  Well, at what cost, Jimmy?  At what cost?  Losing the entire country  to fucking roving bands  of kooks?  No, we're not going to have that.  No?  Really?  Don't think so?  I honestly don't.  All right.  I honestly don't.  All right.  Just stay in your nice areas 
[01:36:30]  and batten down the hatches  because we've already lost  a few cities  that are gone forever.  Just gone to drugs,  crime, murder.  No, because then  they'll elect a conservative.  Yeah.  And some of the stuff  will get taken.  It's almost like,  I hate to say  three steps forward,  two steps back,  but that's the way  it is with stuff.  It's like one comes in,  does all this shit,  the next one comes in,  takes back some of that shit,  does their shit,  the next one comes in,  takes back some of that shit,  and does,  it's like nobody is making  any real leaps.  Everybody's taking little, 
[01:37:00]  in the end,  it's this little,  all the stuff Bush did  to fight,  gays being in the military,  Obama,  just could take it away.  So do it in four years  and then give us  another eight years  of somebody  that's a little more  fucking Republican.  The Republicans  forced me.  It seems to be  eight years  of Republican  to four years Democrat  works okay.  They forced me  into this position  by making the fines  tenfold for radio.  As much as the liberals  are enraging with language  and they do stink, 
[01:37:30]  they are not the ones  that went from  35,000 to 350,000.  That was a conservative  reaction to sex.  At that point,  the fucking head  of the FCC  was a Clinton appointee.  Yeah.  A Clinton fucking appointee.  But you know  how it is with climate.  Whatever.  It's what they focus on.  They focus on things  like porn,  which is why  Max Hardcore is in jail.  They focus on things  depending on the mood  that's coming down  from above.  You know that.  It's not the focus anymore  so you really haven't  heard about that anymore.  Whatever is the focus  from above  is what... 
[01:38:00]  It's kind of like Fox  or CNN.  The attitude  and the angle  of most of the staff  comes from  the parent company attitude.  Right.  It's the way all media is.  So the same in politics.  I agree that  you need your checks  and balances  but for the love of God  I see it as  two years R  one year D  or one term D.  You want to talk  to a black guy  that agrees  completely with you?  All right. 
[01:38:30]  Hopefully he'll call.  That's funny.  Sell out.  You're on the line.  Tom,  your nephew...  Tom,  your nephew...  All right.  No, actually we got one.  We got one.  It's Paul in Philly  and he says  I'm very, very black.  I don't know  if that means color  or...  Yeah.  Or...  Yes.  Or yeah.  Yoffit, you're on the phone.  Paul, what's up, brother?  Hi, sir.  Where do you...  I'm looking for the sellout shit.  Where do you live in Philly? 
[01:39:00]  I'm just kidding, Paul.  I live outside of Philadelphia  next to a city called Chester.  And Chester is shit.  Chester.  All right.  Chester is shit.  Chester has one of the highest  murder rates  in the country  per capita.  Tear for Chester.  Oh, not supposed to applaud that record.  This guy, by the way,  is very black.  Okay.  All right.  He just proved that.  Go ahead, Paul.  It is ridiculous.  You know what I did all weekend?  What?  Nothing.  You know why?  Because I get tired of going out 
[01:39:30]  and being embarrassed  by my people.  God damn.  See?  I like your honesty, sir.  Wait a minute.  You stayed home...  Hold on.  Let me ask you a question, Paul.  You stayed...  No, I...  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  You stayed home  just because you were embarrassed  by the black people?  I stayed home  because I did not feel like  dealing with  an incident that could happen.  Mm.  Wait a minute.  When it's hot...  Oh, okay.  When it's hot,  bullshit happens.  I see what you're saying.  All right.  Yeah, that heat, man. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  People get out of pocket.  Language.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  And it's not just black.  It's also white.  Because I see a lot of white kids...  You just lost Anthony.  No, no.  Oh, I'm listening.  ...are just...  Just embarrassed  by how they act.  But I'm talking about my people.  It's ridiculous  that they don't take advantage  of the opportunity.  I come...  I'm from the same town  that Ronnie's from.  If you ever talk to Ronnie,  Ronnie will tell you  the town of shit.  Yeah, Ronnie is from Chester.  I've heard Ronnie talk about that. 
[01:40:30]  It's hilarious.  And there's no reason  for it to be that way.  Oh, my God.  I was sorry.  I was just looking  at the stats.  I was just looking  at the stats for Chester.  Holy shit.  That's a big slice  of the pie.  You guys get a big slice  of that pie.  Yes, we do.  And you know what?  The saddest part  about it is  all that money  goes to the people  who you're talking about.  Yeah.  But guys like me  who work 50, 
[01:41:00]  50 hours a week,  who are  $100,000 income families,  who go to church  and do what  they're supposed to do,  you don't hear about us.  Yeah.  Only thing you hear about  is shit that happened  like at this wave.  Can I address something  quickly?  Because I've heard  this point being made  before and it's  a good point,  but it's almost like  it's...  Yeah, you don't hear... 
[01:41:30]  If you ask me  about Al Sharpton...  No, no, I'm not.  I'm not at all.  I'm not at all.  I never trusted  you with a perm.  No, it's like  the Chris Rock bit.  It's like,  all right,  you say you go to work,  you fucking pay your bills,  you go to church,  you do what you're supposed to do  and that doesn't get any attention,  that's because that's  exactly what the fuck  you're supposed to do.  Why would it be on the news?  Hey, ladies and gentlemen,  a black man  actually went to work today  and he fed his family  and went to church.  Why would that be news? 
[01:42:00]  That's called  acting the way  you're supposed to act.  The only thing  that makes the news  is the crime  and the violence  because that's called  the news.  Because that's what you see.  But,  guys like me,  we don't want to be on the news.  You don't care,  you know,  it's embarrassing.  New Year's Eve,  okay,  I thought it was  a fucking riot outside.  Yeah.  Here it is,  my neighborhood,  it's nice and quiet  New Year's Eve,  but you can't hear  the gunshots  from blocks and blocks away. 
[01:42:30]  Come out New Year's Day.  There's a fucking building  on windshield.  Oh, Jesus.  That's gotta be nice.  Who would throw  a Steve McQueen film  onto your car?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  Whoa.  Here's the chase.  All right,  well,  thank you  and more power  to you,  my brother.  There goes Paul  from Chester.  I just didn't want,  I didn't want to get  two days in a row  heavy into a race thing,  but it's just been,  it's been infurigating me 
[01:43:00]  that it just seems  to be building  and building  and no one  is really saying anything  or addressing it.  They're just,  they're calling it,  you know,  unruly teens  and no one's  really addressing  the problem  and I do see it  as a leadership problem  that does go up  to the presidency.  I think,  thank you.  Drudge is a conservative slant  just like Huffington Post  is a liberal slant.  They both have  the way they lean  kind of.  Slanting is slanting,  but that happened. 
[01:43:30]  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is  what they're showing  and the way  they're painting it  is,  it is real news  and it should be talked about,  but it's also putting  all those in,  it's not a completely  unconscious decision  to put.  Maybe not.  Maybe it is.  I might say it's a bad decision.  Maybe it's a conscious decision  to go,  look at what the fuck  is happening.  Yeah.  Can someone do something  about this, please?  So people could go to beaches  or a fucking water park  or something 
[01:44:00]  and not have to worry  so much  when they see  large groups  of unruly teens,  maybe they don't  have to worry  as much.  Why do people worry  when they see  a large group  of unruly teens?  Why is that?  Is it because  you just see  that sometimes  this boils over  into fighting  and somebody innocent  might get hurt?  Yeah.  I've been lucky enough  not to see unruly teens.  You've been lucky enough  not to?  I haven't seen  unruly teens yet.  You're probably not. 
[01:44:30]  I'm very lucky.  You probably don't go  to places  where there's a lot  of unruly teens.  Let them be unruly.  Really?  Because it doesn't  affect me.  It is fucking annoying  you can't go anywhere  without it being...  It's like anybody...  I love people  who act like  they don't see race  at all.  Like, anybody who's out,  like, you know,  you're out with your chick  and if you're in a place  and you see 20 black guys  coming through,  I wish it wasn't that way  where I would feel like,  uh-oh.  And most times  nothing would happen, 
[01:45:00]  but I wish I didn't feel like,  oh, fuck,  there's going to be a problem.  See, I wish I wasn't that way.  Yeah.  I don't want to feel that way.  I don't want to think of that.  More importantly,  part two of Anthony Weiner denying...  Oh, well, that is absolutely...  More importantly.  I really do want to hear this guy.  He rules.  We should take a break  and we'll do part two  and we got Otto  from Otto and George  coming in today.  Oh, I didn't know that.  So why don't we do that?  Otto.  Otto.  Brand new FU line  with brand new production.  We'll do that.  We'll come back.  We'll do part two  of Anthony Weiner 
[01:45:30]  just not answering  the fucking questions.  Not answering questions  about his Twitter.  Lots to do.  Stay there.  Thanks for calling  the Opie and Anthony  FU line.  Here's the latest batch  of FU's.  Fuck you!  This is for Bobo.  Hey, Bobo, fuck you.  Just get off the fucking air,  pack your fucking bag,  and go live somewhere  where nobody has to hear  that stupid fucking voice of yours.  Die, Bobo.  Fuck you!  I just want to give a big FU  to the university  I'm graduating from.  I'm fucking out of here, biggie. 
[01:46:00]  Fucking for four years.  Y'all screw me.  All right, so fuck you.  Fuck you!  I want to give a big fuck you  to the Grim Reaper  and Father Time.  See, after taking my best friends,  my parents,  and leaving my last 20 years  of medicated fucking misery.  And you know what?  Don't get cocky, Mother Nature,  because I'm not above  kicking you right in the squad either.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This is a dedication to Anthony. 
[01:46:30]  Anthony, for you.  I'd like to give a big FU  to my soon-to-be ex-wife.  12 years of torture  you put me through.  All I gotta say is one thing.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This is my FU  from my good boy phone.  Fuck you!  And this is my FU  from my nutty boy phone.  Fuck you!  Fuck you  to my stupid girlfriend.  Fella, you're cheaper,  and it's with a married man. 
[01:47:00]  Guess what?  I hope he gets herpes from you  and takes it back to his life.  Fuck you both.  Fuck you!  Huh?  For all you people out there  telling dirty stories on me,  FU!  I was just trying to see  if his underpants fit correctly.  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  The Virus. 
[01:47:30]  Follow the Opie and Anthony show online  on Facebook.com  slash Opie and Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Opie Radio.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to get right back  to the Wiener gate.  Wiener gate.  Have they called it something gate yet?  Twitter gate?  Oh, they have?  They're going with Wiener gate.  Wiener gate.  So you got this rep here  in the New York area. 
[01:48:00]  He's had a little juice lately.  He seems to be moving up a little bit  in the political world.  Is he a moralizer?  Does anybody know?  I don't know.  Like we were just talking  on the break about Spitzer  and how he got busted  but he was a guy who was  a moralizer.  I don't think so.  Not like a Spitzer anyway.  Spitzer was really over the top  with that shit.  Yeah.  Whoopsie.  I'm always happier  when they get in trouble.  You know what?  A little time goes by  and now he's a TV star.  Yeah.  And people respect him again.  I bet you he'll run again.  Of course he will.  So the Wiener possibly sent 
[01:48:30]  a photo to a young lad  that has...  Lassie.  Lassie.  A lad would have been really good.  That would have been hot.  That is extremely ample above.  And kind of cute.  A little college co-ed  of his Wiener  in boxer shorts.  Yeah.  It was kind of plumped up.  Of course he's denying it.  Jimmy is thinking  maybe he meant that  as a DM,  direct message.  I do.  But the thing is  he's not denying it.  That's just it.  You're right.  He's not.  He's not really going out 
[01:49:00]  and denying it.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  You're right.  At first he said he was hacked.  His account was hacked  and it's, you know,  somebody put a picture up there  or something.  But now whenever he's asked,  now he's not denying it  and it's come out  that he's following  a bunch of other young girls  and some of them  porn stars on Twitter.  And, you know,  it's starting to look like  maybe that was him.  You know,  that's kind of,  that's just stupid.  If you're a politician  following young girls  and porn stars.  That's dumb right there.  That's stupid.  On an open forum  like Twitter 
[01:49:30]  where you could just check  and say,  oh, that's who you follow?  Especially when you're  in a business  like being a politician  where they study everything.  Yeah.  You know,  your haters are looking  for something to get you on.  Yeah.  Somebody that wants your job  is just looking for fuel  and that's it.  It's just a dummy  that,  like anyone else out there  obsessed with Twitter followers  and the whole social networking.  Yep.  But it's going to sink him, man.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucked.  So,  Danny brought us  some great audio  and this is part two of it. 
[01:50:00]  We decided,  no,  we need more.  Yeah,  we need more of this guy.  Danny gave us a fine sample of it,  but.  He was having a press conference.  Yep.  I guess he wanted to talk about,  you know,  all things political.  The budget,  things like that.  And the press wouldn't  leave him alone.  They're asking him,  hey,  was this you?  Did you send this tweet  to this girl?  And he's just,  he's not answering  the fucking question.  He's making me hate his guts.  And I'm starting to think  he's really stupid  because I think he thought  he could skate through this  and decided,  wow,  this attention I'm getting  is pretty cool.  He gets attention. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  People are going to write that later.  Yes,  of course.  But not this type of attention.  So he's thinking,  fuck,  I'm going to go with this,  get my face out there  and then realize,  oh boy,  what a mistake.  They probably,  his people probably also told him,  look,  you get back out there,  you quell this whole thing  just by business as usual.  You talk about the politics  and the budget  and whatever you want  to talk about.  And meanwhile,  he just gets hammered  by the press  about this Twitter thing  and he won't answer  the questions.  Which one of them  do you think came up  with the pie analogy?  Yeah, 
[01:51:00]  yeah.  You don't think  he came up with that?  He might have  and they co-signed it,  but that was talked about  in the back.  Oh,  you know it was.  Pie,  someone's throwing a pie  and I want to get out  with business.  You're talking about pie.  That's great,  Mark.  What are we going to do?  Delete it up like pie.  Just talk about pie  the rest of the press conference?  No,  we'd move on  to something else.  Yes,  let's move on  from the pie  to you texting  fucking girls.  If someone threw a pie,  we wouldn't be talking  about it.  However,  if a representative  put pie in his underpants  and sent a photo  to a college student,  we would.  Well,  he wanted to put  his peener in some pie. 
[01:51:30]  Of course he did.  Some hair pie.  Some cherry pie,  possibly.  Somebody may have  Twittered him a photo  of me in my underpants.  Yes,  I did.  What?  I Twittered  Representative Wiener  a photo of me  in my underpants.  Let's all do that.  Everyone should,  really.  Yeah,  let's all do that.  You can't see my face,  but you can just  see my underpants.  In your underpants.  I just want to plump up  a little bit.  And I remember  that the picture 
[01:52:00]  is not,  it's just,  they're burgundy underpants,  but there's like  little stains on them.  There's water stains,  I believe.  I believe it was water  and not tank.  But I think everybody  should send underpants photos.  Underpants.  Don't send anything vulgar,  just send a photo  of you and your boxers.  It's got to be  just regular underpants.  Which is kind of  what he did.  Yeah.  You said you're not  sending this,  you're now.  It's so obviously you.  Wet, 
[01:52:30]  your wet underwear.  That's fantastic.  Yes.  Ah, shit.  Well,  I'd love to hear  the rest of this wiener.  Here we go.  Part two of the wiener gate.  As the little rule of the game.  Let me just,  let me just,  let me just,  let me just give the answer.  The objective of the person  who is doing the mischief  is to try to distract me  from what I'm doing. 
[01:53:00]  So for the last couple of days  that has happened,  I've made a decision.  I'm not going to let it  happen today.  I'm not going to let it  happen tomorrow.  You're free.  You're doing your job.  I understand it.  Just go ahead and do it,  but you're going to have  to do it without me  every day  and answer more questions  about this.  Today I want to talk about  the debt limit.  This debt limit vote  tonight is very important.  Congressman,  why haven't you asked  the police to investigate this?  Let me just make a point.  Why did you not ask  the police to investigate this?  about the debt limit?  Is it because you don't want  to find out what the answer is?  Let me make a point  about the debt limit.  You know,  we are tonight  Oh my God.  It's 45 to be cast in a vote 
[01:53:30]  on something that has  monumental importance  to our economy.  Whether or not  we have a stunt vote  on something of importance  to the debt limit.  He's just plowing right there.  I'm not that important  if you had time  to do what you did.  I want to focus  on what I'm working on.  On that.  I want to focus on that  because frankly  I think my constituents  want me to  and I think that  No, your constituents  want to know.  So that's what I'm going to do.  You don't have to.  You can continue  doing whatever you want to do.  But I am not going to allow  this thing  to dominate what I talk about.  We're covering that.  We're covering that.  You understand that 
[01:54:00]  in the statements  that you put out  you have said  that you were hacked.  And so  it's sort of a logical question  that we really wish  that you would answer.  Why?  I have you.  You've got to refer  to my statements.  You've got to refer  to my statements.  If they didn't  we would be happy to.  Look, all I can tell you  is I put out statements  the last couple of days  responding to everyone  saying this is the last  question we're going to ask.  And in fact  it's pretty clear  that by your presence here  some people have been  successful making  the conversation  that's something I simply  choose not to participate  in anymore. 
[01:54:30]  You can feel free  to still cover it.  If you would deny this  and you would answer directly.  If you can feel free  to stay here  and ask me again.  But you know  we have a situation  where across the way  is the Supreme Court  that Justice Clarence Thomas  his household  received over  $800,000  of remuneration  from people  that are trying  to overturn  the health care law.  Trying to stop it.  And he's refusing  to recuse himself.  I think that's pretty important.  That's a pretty important thing  that I'm going to devote  my energies to  and those are the things  I'm going to talk to. 
[01:55:00]  He's right.  We are right.  But I was going to say  usually the press  is despicable  but fucking loving  them right here.  They're right in this case.  It's pretty rare  I love the press.  They are right.  They just shouldn't be.  Because literally  it's not like he's  answering it  and they keep going  he literally is just not  it's a fair question  did you send it  yes or no.  I love that they're not  It's a public forum.  And guaranteed  if he said  no I didn't send it  they would be like  okay now  what do you want  to talk about?  Like they would stop.  No they wouldn't. 
[01:55:30]  They didn't follow questions.  Why did you call the police?  But at least he would  have something like  look I answered your question.  I'd be like  no I answered it.  Now go fuck yourself.  Yeah I don't think  they would stop.  I'm with Jimmy.  That's when they become  despicable again probably.  Unless he had handled it properly  because then they would say  why didn't you call  the Capitol Police right away?  Why did you wait?  Why do you follow her on Twitter?  Do you know?  They would have other questions  but if he legitimately  wasn't doing anything wrong  they're all answerable questions.  Why?  Look at the rest of the people  I'm following.  I follow men. 
[01:56:00]  I follow women.  How come you're not focusing  on the men I follow?  I follow.  You know what I mean?  There's no answer.  My password was changed.  I had to go to Twitter.  They actually helped me  get my original password back  or my new password back.  There's all these things  that he would be doing  if he was innocent.  Mm-hmm.  Do you have any evidence?  You didn't say that  you did retain a lawyer.  So what are you directing  your attorney to do  on your behalf?  Passed on your information?  We aren't going to  I think the statement  speaks to that.  It says they are going to advise 
[01:56:30]  us on appropriate next steps.  No, that's not right.  It doesn't say that.  So I would refer you back  to the statement  and read it this entire time.  Are there any other questions?  Why are you following  somebody in the deepening  I love that guy.  Is that one that he said?  Why are you following?  Yeah, Frankie Five Angels  wants to know  why he's following  somebody else.  Why?  Why?  Sign up for Queen Next Steps.  No, that's not right.  It doesn't say that.  So I would refer you back  to the statement  and read it this entire time. 
[01:57:00]  I appreciate it.  Are there any other questions?  Why are you following  somebody in the deepening  That is another question.  Look, there are people  who are going to want  to try to distract  from the work  that I have to do.  There are people  who are going to want  to have this debate.  And to some degree  the people that are engaging it  are zealous to do it.  Why?  But I don't want to.  I choose to fight  for the things  that I care about  and the things  that I'm not working on.  I know this is  how the game is played.  Some people decide  they want to talk  about this thing  for days and days. 
[01:57:30]  I choose not to.  That's my problem.  I'm sorry.  Can I just throw this out there?  If this is the non-stor  that you say this is  and a distraction.  I characterize the distraction.  I'll leave it to you  to make the decision.  If this is just a distraction  you're a sophisticated guy.  Why not just answer  the questions  and then you'll be done?  I've been doing that  for several days.  Now I choose  now I choose  now I try.  There are people  who apparently  have no statements.  I assume that you have.  Look, all I can tell you  is this.  If this is  this is  Wait, can you pause  for a second, Danny?  Do we have a copy  of the statement? 
[01:58:00]  I would like to see  what he released.  I would love to see  what this statement is.  And if he denies it  in the statement  then the press  should all be just executed.  You know the problem here,  right, Jimmy?  He used his good boy Twitter  when he should have used  his naughty boy Twitter.  Oh, my.  You know what?  He has  Oh.  A good boy phone  and a naughty boy phone  A naughty boy phone 
[01:58:30]  and his good boy's phone  He used a good boy phone  and a naughty boy's phone  A naughty boy's phone  and his good boy's phone  If you knew how happy  it made me  all the tweets I get  people have this song  Stuck in their head  Mule kicking them  in the fucking head  Yeah, yeah, it is  It's very sticky  Well, Drew Boogie  put it over the top yesterday  with what he did with it  Yeah, we're going to get  a regular  You got a guy  He should have had 
[01:59:00]  a naughty boy Twitter  He's just a  But on Twitter  Certainly a naughty boy phone  But dude, as a politician  you're following  these chicks on Twitter  You're trying to  private message a photo  You dumb motherfucker  I wouldn't  If he had emailed a girl  a photo  this would be much less  interesting to me  because that to me  is tremendously private  But you're meeting her  on a public forum  where everyone can see it  You just didn't know  what you were doing, dummy  His perv switch went off  because he wasn't even sure  she was going to be  into the photo 
[01:59:30]  I need to tweet this  Yep, yep, yep  Statement  Okay  His statement  Yeah, I'd like to know  Whenever you say  refer to the statements  no guy  at least I don't think  any guy  who's telling the truth  says that  We got you right in front of us  Refer to the statement  Read the statement again for us  If your story is true  and you're just denying something  then you should be  angrily denying it  in front of every camera  every chance you get  Right, exactly  Because the more people  the times they ask you  the more chances you have  to fucking prove 
[02:00:00]  that you're innocent  and that you want the guy  Because he said  the person making the mischief  Really, Nana?  Is that how you talk?  Making the mischief  The person who sent my cock bulge  and put toilet paper in the tree  Right  And making the mischief  And if you deny  that's what they're going to go with  so you get that  out there even more  He's getting ahead of the story  with his asshole open  Alright, let's go back  to the audio then  We'll get the statement  Day three or day four  they want to continue  talking about something 
[02:00:30]  that I consider a distraction  and me making a decision  on how I'm going to deal with this  And the decision that I've made  is I'm not going to permit it  to distract  I'm not going to permit it  to continue on  for three, four, five  or six more days  If that's unsatisfactory to you  I apologize  But I think that  what people really want  to talk about  are things like  the debt limit vote tonight  are things like  the oppressive disparity  between the very well-to-do  in this country  and people that don't have as much  or the fact that  it's more and more difficult  being the middle class  in this country  That's what I'm here to look at  Thank you guys  They're going to move on  They're going to move on  Now he's just walking away 
[02:01:00]  Wow, what an exchange  What a well-blood's not to say  Dana still with us  up on Capitol Hill  Dana, I don't think  the story's going to go away yet  Just to recap  Has the congressman asked  has the congressman asked Capitol Hill police  or New York City police  or any local law enforcement authority  or the FBI for that matter  to investigate  who may have gone into his Twitter account  and sent out this lewd photo?  Well, as you saw there 
[02:01:30]  I tried to ask that question  probably more than a handful of times  He wouldn't answer  But I can tell you  from talking to spokespeople  for both the Capitol Police  and we also talked to the FBI  The answer is no  that they are not investigating  In the case of the FBI  they explicitly said  that they were not asked  by Congressman Wiener  to do that  Otherwise they would  And I can just tell you  that in talking to law enforcement  officials familiar  with the process and protocol  here on Capitol Hill  If the Capitol Police  is not investigating  I'm told it's because  he has not asked to do that  But you saw 
[02:02:00]  that was the first question  that I had for him  because he has said  that he was hacked  which of course  is, especially when you're talking  about Congress  is potentially criminal  So, you know  why not have  law enforcement investigate  I should also say  that the tall guy  next to me  was Ted Barrett  of course  our congressional producer  I demand answers  right away  Representative Wiener  We disagree  Answer my questions  This is Ted's  pointed question  emporium  Did you send photos  of your penis? 
[02:02:30]  Did you?  Did you?  Did you?  How big is it?  Does it get cold  and shrivel  like mine does  Representative Wiener?  You refuse  to answer my questions  Why does it always  work out with the name  too?  I know  Wiener  It's just weird  how that happens  in society  The statement  it's just a couple  of sentences  And it's very vague  right?  It says  Anthony Wiener's  Twitter was hacked  He did not  send the photograph 
[02:03:00]  nor does he know  of the woman  to whom it was sent  You know what?  But that statement  was put out  before  the news came out  that he was  following the girl  But he doesn't  know her  And you know what?  So he doesn't  know her  That is a denial  He did not  send the photograph  Yes, that is a denial  That is a denial  How does he not  know her?  He only follows  a few people  Well, I don't know  Actually  If you're following  He's 100 
[02:03:30]  200 people  But he doesn't  know her  And he fucking  He did deny it  in the statement  I guess you  don't have to  know the person  You're right I guess  He did deny it  But you're obviously  following because  she looks like  a sexy co-ed  I'm not saying  he didn't do it  But to me  he did deny it  in the statement  He might have  low moral standards  Or at least  he was hoping  Yeah, it is a denial  though  You're right  That is a denial  Complete  But now he seems  to be  Why doesn't he  just reiterate then 
[02:04:00]  Whenever they ask him  and he says  refer to my statement  You could say  that that seems  a little evasive  He could say  my statement said  that I was hacked  I didn't send  the photograph  and I don't know  the woman that  it was sent to  So what more  do you want from me?  There  What more do you want?  Hey  I think this  goes a little  deeper  We're going to  get to the bottom  of this  We certainly are  We love a good  scandal 
[02:04:30]  Let's go to  Andy and Cleveland  Oh, look at  the little  leopards  or whatever they are  Morning, morning  Morning  Yeah, I think  they're leopards  I was just thinking  he needs a good boy  tweet  and a naughty boy  tweet  Now he's going  to lose  his congressional seat  He's asking questions  He's feeling the heat  He needs a good boy  tweet  and a naughty boy  tweet  He has a good boy  Twitter  and a naughty boy  Twitter  A naughty boy  Twitter  and a good boy 
[02:05:00]  Twitter  Naughty  Naughty  Very good  Good song, brother  Yes, very naughty  I don't know  If you're in politics  you shouldn't even  have Twitter  Facebook  nothing  and if you do  it should be run  by like your  staff  with just political  stuff on it  You can't have  porn chicks  You can't be  fucking tweeting  your dick  You can't do  any of that shit  You chose a job  where you can't  do that  Hold on  You can't follow  someone where  they would go  why are you 
[02:05:30]  following that person  Right  There should be  no doubt  that it's like  I follow  Hillary Clinton  Obama  Exactly  That's what it would be  I don't know  John Stewart  because we used  to be roommates  Yeah  That's it  Now us on the  other hand  we could follow  any despicable  creature we want  yet we probably  can't run  for public office  See how that works  See  but we know  that going into it  Yes  Yes  Making science sexy  at a science festival  Yes 
[02:06:00]  That's right  Well Brian  this is interesting  because we talk  so much about how  people should be  whatever they want  to be and whatever  they're good at  but the reality is  if you want to be  employed for a long time  there are certainly  certain professions  in the science  technologies  Making science sexy  Why is  Alan Holden  Exactly  Yes  You said  they should be  anything  they want to be  You've got to do  what you're passionate  about  That's number one  Why are they not  letting him talk  We can get kids  to be passionate  about science  if we teach it 
[02:06:30]  in a different way  If we show them  that science  is a dramatic story  of adventure  Quiet and ugly  You look like  fucking Bill Marm  Hawkeye talk  Yeah where's Hawkeye  I wound up  at the bodies  You son of a bitch  I want to see him  yell at Mako  I want to see him  yell  Don't let the  bastards win  So that's the  fascinating part  You guys are sort of  merging art  and science  In fact you wrote  this play  all about Marie Curie  and that's going to  be read tonight  as well  Wow  Is it a way  to get people  who might normally 
[02:07:00]  be frightened  or feel that  math and science  are very  technical  not so exciting  things  Yeah I think it is  but it's all  it's something else  too  Science is a  great detective story  There's something  very exciting  about watching  people use their  brains to figure  out this incredible  problem  Brains  What is this stuff  How do we make  this save lives  Will you  Shut up Alex 
[02:07:30]  That's a great  detective story  Just understanding  the universe better  Marie Curie story  that I wrote  this play  Who is that  bitch  I'll play  about  Madame Curie  Marie Curie  She worked with  radio  experience  of science  She worked with  radioactive  materials  I had to go and  heckle  She wound up  dying from it  Bullshit  Petri dish  Boo  Radiation  Boo  Boo  Yeah E equals  MC squared 
[02:08:00]  my balls  Boo  Science is for  queers  Shut up  Yes  I really wish I  had the fucking  moral  The moral  turpitude  to go and give  science heckles  Boo  Space time  You're wasting  my space time  Well let's see  Wiener  We have this  just coming in  here  Wiener is a  supporter of  net neutrality 
[02:08:30]  which is a  policy that would  give the FCC  power to regulate  the internet  Oh go fuck  yourself  Typical  fucking  piece of shit  God almighty  More regulation  Net neutrality  Let me ask one  question  Is that about  content  or is that  about bandwidth  It's kind of  more about  bandwidth  It's not about  certain offensive  websites being  taken down  right  Not to my  knowledge  Seems a little  grey there  Yeah it is  When you start  reading about it  it just kind of  spurts off  It's probably a  means to that  end  It's probably a 
[02:09:00]  way to get in  there a little  Yeah the FCC  A way to get in  and take a little  look  Yeah you're right  Take a little  look  Way to get their  eyes on the  problem  That's right  There's something  going on  There would be  content also  Content  There would be  content  Fucking hate  Fuck yourself  This is where  the democrats  lose me  Will you stop  it  That's what  the conservative  republicans do  You fucking  assholes  I'm screaming  I apologize  Well no it's  okay  But that's what  I hate about  the conservative  republicans  It's that  fucking minding 
[02:09:30]  my business  Can the democrats  You're supposed  to be different  You're supposed  to be liberal  Democrats love  getting more  government in  your ass  They love it  Love things in  my ass  Especially fingers  Small penis  shaped objects  No penises though  Cause that'd  make me a queer  I've only had  them pressed  against the  pink  the pink  budding  nub  of my  asshole  I've never  taken one  in the  asshole  Wow  We don't  remember  asking yet  Oh no no  I was just  saying  It's not a 
[02:10:00]  matter of  being homophobic  but then I  just go  Sometimes Kenny  has to knock on  my hotel door  Are you okay  in there  What are you  doing  I'm like  yeah why  cause you  were going  Ow ow ow ow  ow ow ow  Sorry  You can't have  things in your  ass like that  No  Especially if  you're yelling  ow ow  Exactly  Two ebony  hands on your  hips  Straight and  you're right  out  We're gonna

[02:11:30]  just hear  you don't see  it  but he shoots  his forehead  back  about 8 inches  that's his  only reaction  I've never seen  that guy do  that  It's so subtle  His forehead  tightens up  that's the  entire reaction  I've done that  before in scenes  No you haven't  Chip  So I haven't seen  I always have  jokes but then  I'm not on the  radio  you guys get to  say it like  the date and  stuff happens  Yeah it's kind  of handy  Yeah and then  I'm here like  six months later  Six months for the  jokes  Pathetic dated

[02:13:00]  a fucking  John Candy  with smaller tits  Fuck at least  she doesn't have  cock breath anymore  Doesn't she look  like Chris Penn  She really  after his death  I know  You take that tree  away from my daddy  Who's not pointing  that penis at my daddy  Yeah  Cher couldn't be  reached for comment  but she was seen  skiing towards a tree  in Colorado  Thank you Mr. Will  You would think 
[02:13:30]  she would have  had an open mind  about this whole thing  but she kind of does it  Oh that's fucking  Trisha  She's warming up  a little bit  She said she misses  hearing her daughter's voice  that it's now like  hello  I'm sorry  She does have that  deep voice now  Oh my god  what a wreck  Trisha's always  giving me shit  because I complain  when I get up  to do this show  I go man  I'm so tired  she goes  ah stop it  once a year  you gotta get up  like she thinks  I get a full night's sleep  she doesn't know  that  And then she's calling  while you're on the air 
[02:14:00]  Two in the morning  I'm standing over her bed  holding a ball peen hammer  you know  think about that  ours wasn't so bad  it'd be worth  a little piece of quiet air  split her fat head open  while she's sleeping  gives me shit  because I want to sleep  another half hour  Who does it?  If it's any consolation  every morning  I get up and think that  It doesn't get easy  like I don't want to get up  Do you set your clock  so you get to  like four alarms  on my iPhone  But I mean  do you give yourself  that extra half hour  by setting it earlier?  Yeah I set it 
[02:14:30]  way earlier  and then it's four alarms  that are set like  maybe five to eight minutes apart  Really?  And uh  yeah cause I need that like  I need to wake up  in gradual segments  You should have  the bank president  stand next to your bed  as much money  as you've given them  Just have him stand there  and nudge you  She can nudge me  It goes time  giving him enough cash  Anthony  Anthony  wake up  You need more of your money  in the bank  You know what the horror is though?  Kenny calls me  every day promptly 
[02:15:00]  at 4.50  He did?  He calls me  Yeah  And um  it's my iPhone  so I have a picture of Kenny  Oh god  So my alarm goes off first  One alarm goes off first  and then I grab my phone  and I shut the alarm off  and I hold the phone  in my hand  as I'm nodding back off  a little bit  Yeah  So then the second  it vibrates  before it rings  I hit the sound thing  so it doesn't ring  Right  But I turn  and I get a vision 
[02:15:30]  of Kenny's  big face  Kenny's the first face  I see in the morning  Oh god  That fucking Frankenstein  is the first thing  I have to look at  Why don't you change it  to like a playmate  or something  Yeah  Because then it would just be  more disappointing  going  Hello  You see that fucking face  It's just like  It wakes me up  It makes me think  Ugh  Okay  Yeah  It's no more getting asleep  It's like a nightmare  Assembly outfit  he's wearing today  Assembly  Yeah  So well aquafed an iron  today  He's adorable  He picks the worst colors 
[02:16:00]  Yeah  He wears suits  Okay  But he picks the worst color suits  He does  That's the picture I have  of Kenny when he calls  Don't be cop  Yeah  His angelfish profile  Is that fucking horrendous  Angel fish  Who came up with the angelfish  Jay Moore  It's the best line of the century  Kenny looks like an angelfish  That is brilliant  An angelfish  Yeah  Fuck him  We'll find him  Oh  Hi Roland  Hey Roland  Hey Roland  Thank you buddy  What's going on there Roland 
[02:16:30]  Thank you my pet  Let's see what  Fucking albino pubic hairs  you're having for lunch today  I hear there's a premiere  going on today  or a screening  It's adorable  What's it for  X-Men  For X-Men  Right right  That's what I heard  No I can't go  I got shit to do  I just heard about it  You weren't invited by Roland  you mean  No I wasn't  I had to hear about it  because I never go to him  I sent you everybody  Did you  Oh yeah  How was the Malcolm McDowell appearance  I didn't  It was really 
[02:17:00]  It was him  I was just trying to get on  Roland about it  Yeah  It's okay  Malcolm was great  Yeah  Was it like  meeting a beetle  It was like  Yeah  It actually was  It was very  And he was really cool and shit  Yeah  Wasn't an asshole  Did you bring up  Clockwork Orange  Only if  And oh lucky man  Yeah  We didn't really bring up  Clockwork  We didn't feel the need to  Yeah  It was  You must be a little tired  of that being the only movie  that people  I love Clockwork  Maybe not as much as you guys 
[02:17:30]  But I only saw the movie  for the first time recently  Really  You know  The last couple years  I fucking love it  Yeah  I don't really  You know what the  Fucked up thing is  Think about 40  That's a 40 year old movie  Yeah  Think about walking in somewhere  and having to talk about  something you did  40 years ago  Yeah  And be like  passionate about it  Yeah  God  You know  Obviously I know  we're all a little younger  than Malcolm McDowell  Yeah  But picture that much time  and like  What did you do  Is that alright  Yeah I rode my bike  to the store  Hold on 
[02:18:00]  He's different than  other guys though  because he's really  still into it  Yeah  I don't think he was  faking it  I think he really  still has the passion  for that movie  No he's very proud of it  But we've had guys  come in and like  Yes that was 30 years ago  Alright enough  It made him a legend  Yeah but not Malcolm  Malcolm is like  the great  definitive movie  He was doing  lines for the movie  He was  He didn't have to do that  Yeah  Yeah and he signs  autographs like  Viddy well  Viddy well  What lines did he say  from the movie like  We had him do a couple  for Eric our producers  one of our producers  We had him goof on 
[02:18:30]  E-Rock a little bit  Yeah  But just during the interview  he was throwing out  Oh yeah  He did  He imitated Dim too  Oh yeah  We did a little  singing in the rain  just talking through it  No we didn't  I wanted to sing it with him  but I never had a heart to ask  That was good  So great  Yeah I would love to  have just sang that  while he kicked me  I got to see that  in a movie theater  in a re-release  They used to have  these theaters in New York  that played old movies  Yeah so you could see them  on the big screen  again  Much better  I did see it once too  on the same thing  like that  It was a release  in the late 90s  or whatever they did it  Same thing with 2001 
[02:19:00]  There's nothing I've seen  on a big screen  It's very boring  on a television  Yeah you need that  big spectacle  Really dope  Bond movies too  you have to see  on a big screen  A lot of movies  you can see at home  I think it's  especially before  they came out  with widescreen  Yeah  Like what an insult  to a director  to not like  letterbox it at least  or something  like when they show it  in fucking  It looks too cramped  That three  Oh it's just 
[02:19:30]  Pan and scan  Yeah  They use either  pan and scan  or they just  cut the edges off  Yeah  I remember as a kid  watching like  It would just be like  a candle in a restaurant  scene and two noses  That's what the director  was going for  Yeah that was the look  he was going for  You might as well  change the fucking  dialogue  Like not only the  curses which are  an abomination also  but like you might as  well just change the  dialogue and the  fucking lighting  You're changing the  way the director  saw this fucking  movie to fit it  into your dumb 
[02:20:00]  dated  you should get a  new TV TV  The directors are  the assholes  They know the  movies would have  lived on TV  so they should have  fucking filmed it  differently  Fuck the directors  Oh  What?  That's crazy  They knew it was  going to go on to TV  Well the TV people  should have fucking  done it  They couldn't figure  that out  Like a movie like  Lawrence of Arabia  was shot in that  70 millimeter  with like  three projectors  Cinemascope  Yeah three projectors  to get the image  on the screen  Oh wow  Really? 
[02:20:30]  Wow  Yeah it was such  the Ben-Hur  Yeah Ben-Hur  People to stop  watching TV  and come to the  movies  Wasn't it those  curved screen  Yeah  Was it  Cinemascope  or  Yeah 70 millimeter  the fucking film  was like this wide  Yeah  The strip of film  was like this wide  Jesus Christ  35 millimeters  like that  Yeah  Amazing  That's crazy  Speech  It's not a mistake  Yeah  Yeah I just 
[02:21:00]  edited for television  Sorry about  I was supposed to  I called Jimmy  to come to the cellar  and Trish was just like  you don't network enough  you should be there  all the time  you don't kiss ass  that's why  you know  because I've had  there's been like  a little drought  in the stand up  for me anyway lately  but she just kept  breaking my balls  and I just  I said  all right  now I'm not going  and I was like  forget the whole  Aha  Yeah  We had a good time  but the city sucks man  fucking 27 bucks  for two beers 
[02:21:30]  Did I break something?  I'm just fucking  walking his barn  27 bucks  Fucking mother  Yeah  Fucking mother  That's right man  Oh my god  Danny's got this  Cinemascope  this thing up  where they're showing  what a movie looks like  in regular television  Yeah  and then what it's  supposed to look like  That first example  was really funny  Yeah this is hilarious  What is that  for Seven Brides  or Seven Brothers  or something  and then look at  all that's missing 
[02:22:00]  Oh my god  You're missing all that  Like the director  and the fucking  director of photography  Four brides  and a hoof  Yeah  It's supposed to be  You're missing  so fucking much  I can't stand  any movie  that is still  formatted  for a regular  shit little  television set  Wow  It's like  I don't get  They're so cheap  right now  If some fucking  asshole can't afford it  they deserve to die  Well aren't they  shaping TV sets  in the form of  Now they're getting  even bigger 
[02:22:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Which is amazing  Yeah Ben-Hur  is one of those movies  where if you're not  watching that widescreen  Yeah  You're an idiot  Oh really  Yeah  It's an amazing  fucking movie  Look at what you're  missing  The pan and scan  Pan and scan my dick  Yeah I know  Oh good  A horse's face  Look  Yeah  Very tight shot  of the horse  It's Sarah Jessica Parker  starring Ben-Hur  Yeah  It is a crime  I think it takes 
[02:23:00]  so much away  from fucking shit  That's why it is  cool to go  when they show him  back in the movie  theater again  because we saw  something recently  it was just  not even  Bay was Back to the Future  Go see Back to the Future  in the movie theater  It was kind of cool  and I've seen it  like a thousand times  on television  even in a widescreen  Yeah  on television  but then when you just  see that shit  in the theater  it kind of brings  you right back  The Ziegfeld  for a while  was doing that  they like  you go see Apocalypse Now  re-released  fucking great 
[02:23:30]  so different  Yeah yeah  it is  you don't realize  what you're missing  Remember years ago too  when you saw a movie  in the movie theater  that was it  Yeah  It was  you never were going  to see it like that again  Yeah  It was just  you'd see it  maybe like five years later  Right  on Channel 5  creature feature  or something  Isn't that amazing?  We don't know how good  we have it now  you can just own  any movie you want  pop it in  anytime you want  Just go to fucking Netflix  and pop it on  anytime you want  you're not the slave  I remember looking  through the TV guide 
[02:24:00]  and it's like  oh I love that movie  and you'd have to  and if you weren't there  when it was on  you'd fucking missed it  That's true  You had to be home  when it was on  Every year  you had to wait  for certain movies  You're right  How about Star Wars?  How many years  did Star Wars take?  I would love to know  Is there any way  of finding that out?  You wanted to win  and air it on TV  the first time?  Yeah because I remember  when I was growing up  you would start counting down  because then they  finally would announce  okay in the year  whatever  and you're like  oh my god 
[02:24:30]  only a year to go  and we get to see  Star Wars again  That isn't even as bad  on TV  right okay  I remember like  Star Wars ran  for every theater  I saw Planet of the Apes  when I was a kid  and when I was done  I was thinking that  like when we left  the theater  all I'm thinking is  I'm never going to  see that again  like that  It made it way more  important to go  to the movies right?  Yeah  You paid close attention  Jimmy Norton  This is the way  we're going to do  things from now on  I'm going to raise my hand  Jimmy raised his hand  and we called on him  but I was watching  something recently 
[02:25:00]  and they were interviewing  Scorsese and Eastwood  about restoring  old movies  and I forget  which one of them  said it  but they said  all movies  or it was a stat  of all the movies  made before 1950  half of them  are lost forever  half the movies  made before 1950  no one will ever  see again  they're gone  just gone  like they decomposed  probably sucked  I'm sure they weren't  gems  most of them  they weren't all gems  yeah  they took for the creature  the negro next door  was probably lost  it was about a black man 
[02:25:30]  that moved in  and everything went well  and they're like  get rid of this  propaganda  once you transfer  a movie to DVD  whatever  deterioration  is now frozen  in that quality  but they don't know  how long DVDs last  before they deteriorate  yeah  all film is  always deteriorating  the second  the film is exposed  it's already beginning  to age and die  yeah  they got to be kept  in vaults  like humidify  the right humidity 
[02:26:00]  temperature  light  everything fucks it up  beginning in September  of 82  Star Wars  was shown on  pay-per-view  subscription service  wow  that's 82  77  that's not bad  that's bad  compared to today  especially back then  but back then  you dealt with that  even my giant  has to be kept  in an air-conditioned  vault  this fucking  awful movie  that was  why would they  protect that one  I remember  watching a lot  of those  like one  TV Guide 
[02:26:30]  for Newsday  used to be  funny as fuck  like they used  to put really  funny shit  in there  when they  talked about  the movie  it gave a synopsis  and some of those  one star horror movies  were great growing up  oh yeah  Channel 5  and Channel 11  would play  the worst  fucking  creature  from the Black Lagoon  rip offs  a patch of blue  you gotta read  the rest of this  it's way different  it was way different  back then  beginning of September  82  Star Wars was shown  on pay-per-view  subscription service  scattered throughout  the country  despite the fact  that only half 
[02:27:00]  a million households  were wired  for pay-per-view  HBO showed the film  during the winter  of 83  and was disappointed  at the lack of interest  due to their earlier  pay-per-view showings  and the film's release  on videocassette  Star Wars failed to rank  amongst HBO's top 10  popular films  CBS aired it  on regular TV  only after this  so figure  about 1984  they made it to  regular TV  on cable  so it's probably  early 84  that's like  Bill Gates  complaining he didn't  win a $2 scratch-off 
[02:27:30]  ticket  am I supposed to  feel bad  it just shows  where we were  because now  movies in the theaters  when is Hangover 2  going to be available  on DVD  in three months  he's Hopps  right  now as they  shoot the god damn  thing it's on TV  hey Otto  you like newer movies  I know you like  talking about the classics  the last movie  that impressed me  I don't know  I mean  I guess the remake  of True Grit  was pretty good 
[02:28:00]  I liked that  I liked that  Jeff Bridges  is in a good period  now  he plays a good weirdo  right  yeah he's playing  good weathered  characters now  that court scene  in there was great  when he was just  sitting there  testifying  I still think  the John Wayne  movie was better  even though  John Wayne  wasn't really  a great actor  he just  his presence  amazing presence  yeah  and then you had  Robert Duvall  he just had a better  cast than that  you know  what about  The Last Good Comedy  we always ask you guys  that  I don't know  and you're probably  going to go way back 
[02:28:30]  I don't know  like fucking  The Hangover  I guess was alright  I don't know  I don't fall down  laughing  I don't know  that fucking  Kingpin  I'll watch  every time  it's on TV  of course  Bill Murray  still does great  shit  I don't know  but then he does  artsy shit  he loses a lot  of people  I don't love  Bill Murray  at all  I'm not a fan  I think he's  the hippest guy  ever from  Saturday Night Live  his movies  are still  good  he's still  doing good  shit  Eddie Murphy's 
[02:29:00]  lost his joy  completely  he has no joy  for what he does  anymore  he's just banking  the money  doesn't give a fuck  not doing  Ackroyd  Dr. Doolittle  Ackroyd  Ackroyd's doing well  well it sells tequila  right  now something  what the fuck  he's doing  he had a little  drop off  yeah  he fucking  12 and Downhill  says Dr. Detroit  yeah Dr. Detroit  oh god  he he  it's awful  I've seen  better film  on teeth  laughing  yeah 
[02:29:30]  remember the  song for it  Dr. Detroit  Detroit  oh no  Danny  in the 80's  that was a decent  Dr. Detroit  I don't remember  but I remember  that part of it  oh that will  stay in your  fucking head  am I remembering  it wrong  that fat lady  who was the  gangster in that  with the giant  tits  who was pretty  scary  forget her name  Iraqa  yeah  something like  that  sorry  this guy's 
[02:30:00]  got a great  observation about  Ghostbusters  Steve in Nashville  Steve  yes  yeah get the  the old VHS  copy of Ghostbusters  and when they  when they did it  pan and scan  Ernie Hudson  was literally  cut out  he was always  the fourth character  oh so they just  showed the three  guys  wow  yeah  yeah cause he  always walked  on the end  and every shot  you know he was  always on the end  and so in the  pan and scan version  you only saw him  like maybe twice  yeah you never 
[02:30:30]  wanted to be on the  end when they  were filming back  then  you just know  oh fuck  I'm the one  gonna be cut out  for TV  oh what is this  isn't that something  this looks so bad  that was his attempt  at a nutty professor  he's doing a funny dance  in the big group  oh wow  what happened to him  the big dance number  yeah  why don't white people  he wasn't a staple of the 80s really 
[02:31:00]  oh my god this is horrible  white people should never dance  unless you're at the end of a rope  in a Clint Eastwood movie  stop that shit  where's the song  there's a song  that was with James Brown  you want to hear the theme  the theme  of Dr. Detroit  no  can you get the opening credits  yeah 
[02:31:30]  the opening credits  to Dr. Detroit  yeah  boy did I bring this show  to a new world  no  fucking 80s movies  had these weird  oh yeah  these weird like  things in them  like their big dance number  it was never funny  no  nobody  excuse me  ever laughed  at a big dance number  no one laughed at that  I gotta make it hot  are you aware of that  yes of course  that gives it the reverberation sound  very weird  so it's not close  oh the  yeah  odd creature  yeah  every pussy out there  just got wet  thanks to me

[02:32:30]  it takes you forever  oh  gonna do that  enough of the synthesizers  yeah  like that movie  DC Cab  probably the exact same song  oh for the DC Cab  same shit  I don't remember  I don't remember if it's that  Irene Cara  yeah  this is horrible  yeah  my buddy Charlie Barnett  you know the story about Charlie Barnett  the black guy from DC Cab 
[02:33:00]  he was  he lost Saturday Night Live  because he couldn't fucking read  and that's how Eddie Murphy got cast  oh shit  yeah  and he was  he was a street performer  he used to make a fortune  down in Washington Square Park  and he was always high  when I saw him  and he goes  he goes  I just read for this movie  about a black guy  that crashes a spaceship  and shit  you go  alright he's high  and then  that movie  Brother from Another Planet  came out  he was actually talking about that  he read for that 
[02:33:30]  Brother from Another Planet  yeah  do you never saw that movie  Jim Jarmusch  I heard about it  Jim Jarmusch or somebody  yeah  there are certain movies  that I know I'll just never see  yeah  really  and I think that's one of them  you don't want to waste two hours  no  Soul Plane  I know I'll just never watch that  oh what about Snakes on a Plane  same  I've seen that  it was horrible  I knew it was going to be horrible  going into it though  you don't have two hours to give to that  you just  nah  there are some movies  you'd rather watch Bad Lieutenant again  right  yeah  I know what you mean  yeah there are certain movies  and I see like the trailer for it 
[02:34:00]  and you're just like  I'll never fucking see that  yeah  give a shit  yeah I'm with you  the other day I woke up  and fucking  turn on the TV  and Lifetime  is on  and Jay Moore  is in Picture Perfect  uh huh  and it's just like  watching Jay  try to be this  this romantic guy  just say try to be a human being  try to be a human being  is it ruining it for you  it was just like  like  believe me  I like  I like Jay 
[02:34:30]  but watching him in that character  is just like  he should have won an Academy Award  oh  he's with  so not him  he's with old stank pussy  fucking  Jennifer Aniston  Jennifer Aniston  and uh  yeah  did you see uh  I never realized Casey Anthony  has such fucking big juicy tits  Casey Anthony's got  I was just  the last commercial  I was just looking at Casey Anthony pictures  I love that murderer  her fucking  she was wearing this shirt yesterday  with the  and her tits were showing  on the case  in the courtroom  she's got some 
[02:35:00]  ample fucking tits  are they heaving?  yeah  they're like heaving  they think she's in trouble  killing her daughter  killed her daughter  oh another one of those  and um  yeah  yeah  but she's you know  she's white trash  is that the one that drove a car in the water  or no  that's Susan Smith  this one  there was a new one  there was a new one  oh that's right  there was Andrea Yeach  who drowned him  there was Susan Smith  who drowned him  and there was the new lady  the new lady was uh  you need to get a bigger tub  yeah  yeah the new lady had one  one got out though 
[02:35:30]  yeah  one of the  I guess a ten year old  or something  yeah escaped  how about the Long Island rapist  they go into that Rifkin guy  for advice  serial killer  yeah  and the news guys are like  well Joel Rifkin said  look for a guy  who will go unnoticed  carrying a large burlap bag  like a landscape  or something  and then they go  how about that Joel Rifkin  a good American  the go to guy  it's like  he did the same fucking thing  you know  they're treating him like  he's like the nostalgic  like sweetheart 
[02:36:00]  he's another guy  strangled fucking 19 women  for no reason  what a great guy  helping us solve this crime  that's nice  blowing him kisses  from the studio  you know he didn't have  to do this  he didn't have to kill  all those women either  that's a great fucking point though  you get someone  who would have a bag  they could carry  legit  like a painter  oh right  somebody that would  would actually  not be noticed  carrying something  so if you just happen  to look upon them  and they had a fucking  a big burlap thing  yeah yeah 
[02:36:30]  are you trying to solve the crime  or is this part of your  vicious nocturnal activities  no I think it was  like Voss  you're trying to solve this one  yeah  well Voss said  when he's on the road  he's an FBI profiler  oh yeah  Voss plays golf  no no he tells people  when they say  what do you do for a living  because of course  why would they know  he's a comedian  after 30 years  they say to him  what do you do for a living  and this fucking  daydreaming zilch  says I'm an FBI profiler  really  so we call them on  oh that's interesting  he couldn't be a stupid  they're probably like  no wonder everybody's being murdered 
[02:37:00]  what a dopey  and then we try to  play act with the guy  like okay let's see  how this goes  and he just had nothing  give us a profile  let's see  you found a dead hooker  first you dust for DNA  yeah  exactly  dumb stuff like that  well first of all  first of all  there's never going to be  a second of all  I like to find a motive first  do we have that production piece  so I can see it  he thought the Atlanta  the Atlanta child killer  was a description 
[02:37:30]  of whoever was killing  people in Atlanta  he was very young  no stupid face  you're wrong again  can I bring Bonnie with me  because Otto's here  I think we're going to  play real fast  it's quick  this is  boss  okay  sheriff  it looks like we found  another body  this is the third one  this week  I think it's about time  we call in the FBI  somewhere out there 
[02:38:00]  a killer  is on the loose  why yes sheriff  I have been following  that story in the papers  it used to be such  a peaceful little town  and there's only one man  who can catch him  now don't you worry  I'm going to send my best man  down there to help you  in your investigation  but he was busy  here comes fucking  ferret face  whatever  alright agent boss  someone's out there  murdering innocent women  I want you to go down there  and assist the local sheriff  you're one of the  you're one of the bad  you're  get down there 
[02:38:30]  and help the sheriff  how could he be a profiler  his vocabulary is so bad  yeah but no one listens  this summer  the Opie and Anthony show  presents a comedy  about an idiotic comedian  pretending to be an FBI agent  so you work a lot  of murders before  now we're doing mainly  a lot on terrorists  and terrorist type threats  and stuff like that  but you know  back in the day  it was more murders  what are some of the  cases you worked on  just you know  Seattle  the Green River  what do you call it  I can't talk a lot about it 
[02:39:00]  I don't get this much  in detail  starring Jim Norton  he just keeps saying  profile profiler  other profilers  profile  and Rich Voss  great minds stink a lot  I like  oh my god  top profiling  coming to a theater  nowhere near you  or anyone else  thank baby Jesus  the Green River  whatever  whatever  the Green River  whatever  he loves his work  that's great  he literally  couldn't be a stupider man 
[02:39:30]  oh man  don't  not precious  on the Twitter  this is a great story  just came in  from South Carolina  after a two day search  they found an 87 year old woman  who went missing Friday  they found her face down  in a pile of fire ants  oh  oh my god  that's gotta stink  was that fucking  Aardvark Betty  Aardvark Betty 
[02:40:00]  is missing  nobody knew where she was  she would  always fucking  snort up local ants  because that's what  Aardvarks do  non-improver  face down in a fire  ant pile  they got her  try to brush off  ants best they could  oh she fell  face first  and they couldn't  even get all the ants off  of all the unlucky  places to fall  bear trap one  fire ants  fire ants  the dummy  they got her  into an ambulance  then I think  the decision was made  to get her over 
[02:40:30]  to the hospital  that's right  fire ants  did they ravage her  yes  was there an  African American  attempting to remove  the ants  with a shoe heel  or a hammer  she has epilepsy  to begin with  oh boy  great  the ants all  thought she wanted  to dance  oh it's Aardvark Betty  yo what's up bitch  saved her  then she shook  him off of her  she was walking  down the road  the ants kept  falling off  her old nose  and lips  they just kept  trying to bite her  and she would  shake around  bite her own 
[02:41:00]  dumb tongue off  she had to put  her own vulva  into her mouth  and leave them  choking on her tongue  fucking dopey  old bag  stay home  would you stop  wandering everywhere  where's Aardvark Betty  she's just wandering  again  she used to wander  to pick up  aluminum cans  oh great  spies Betty  don't like her huh  what's her real name  something  Mary Clark  is that Mary Clark  good news  they found her  bad news  she was severely 
[02:41:30]  dehydrated  and by one account  she suffered from  thousands of  fire ant bites  fire ants  one of those  will fucking  any audio of her  you're fired  to the ants  she sounds like  trust your Charlotte area  home house heroes  I wish this was  an ad for tire irons  and one just flew  into this woman's head  oh it's a short one  I think  speed arrow  I hate commercials  and speed  okay we start off  with a story  that just may 
[02:42:00]  give you the chills  an 87 year old  woman is missing  was missing  for days  and then yesterday  she was found alive  face down  in a fire ant bed  I'm sorry  can you go back  to laugh  you know  it really might  Dondi and Judy  this really strikes  a chord with some  of you  maybe you have  elderly loved ones  or maybe you're  even a caretaker  today we know  a little bit more  about what happened  in the scene  like old people's faces  I can't think  they find a comedy  in this  one of the fights  of her life  exactly 
[02:42:30]  that's the last  photo of Brenda  ever taken  Clark kept missing  near the cast  at home on Friday  Sunday  two firefighters  part of a team  of searchers  found her  they just happened  to see her  off to the side  laying face down  pretty much  in a fire ant  pile of a knockout  they got her  they rushed off  the fire ant  as best they could  they got her back  on a waiting ambulance  and she was treated  at the scene  and then I think  the decision was made  to get her over  to Palmetto Rich  Memorial Hospital  she was labeled  critical  her daughter says 
[02:43:00]  she has epilepsy  but is on medication  she's not surprised  her mom took off  down the street  she is surprised  she didn't come back  fire ant  on the edge  of a straight razor  yeah you might want  to pass both ways  to save time  what a bird  long she was  on the ground  he calls the search  successful  finding Clark  is what they were after  just not like this  looking for a fat lady  with ants on her face  there she is  there's only one of her 
[02:43:30]  I'm not taking a picture  without Michael  face down  in a hole of fire ants  thousands of fire ants  and my father assured him  that either his signature  or the fire ants  would be on the contract  I could have been a contender  instead of a fire ant  which is what I am  we're all going to learn  something here though  because now we've got to  give you a little something  oh is that what this is  yes  or you think they may  wander off  we talked to some experts 
[02:44:00]  in that area  at USA  they said that it's a good idea  to get a bracelet  to break their legs  dig a pin  and put punji steaks  in there  covered with feces  or shatter their shins  with a hammer  this way  they have to stay seated  hobble your elderly  or tie their shoe lenses  together  hobbling  next to a fire ant pile  and watch them  eat ants  that's what a fucking  anti-dumb fire ants  oh they must have been 
[02:44:30]  all in her eyes  and hair  what a clod  what happened  she probably saw the fire ants  and just panicked  or maybe she wanted  to tackle them  because she thought  they were after the president  she didn't know any better  yeah she didn't know  she thought they were treats  she was trying to  yeah she thought  she had put chocolate  in her mouth  she wanted to have  some chocolate  covered ants  she was stupid  she thought they were  Werther's caramels  she was taking them  to her grandson  dummy  shove your face in there  Werther's 
[02:45:00]  dumb grandparents  with their dumb  ribbon candy  it hurts my tongue  well I think that worked  thank you  not precious  yeah look at that  fire ants are nasty  that's fucking horrendous  just the name  how is that newsworthy  she wasn't even killed  or anything  nah  she just tripped  oh damn  let me see  those are the bites  that's what my cock  looks like  oh shit  that's a lumpy  firearm  fucking fire ant  do you ever see  that thing with the natives  in one of these tribes 
[02:45:30]  to become men  where they fucking  put on the gloves  made of  but they're not fire ants  they're worse than fire ants  yeah  they make fire ants  look like pussies  I think they did that  on not jackass  but the wild boys  yeah they  steve-o  they put their arms  in some shit  yeah  let me see  Danny  maybe that's what  I'm thinking of  instead of the  spider  what is that  it's a fire ant  nest  pile of them  yeah they're just  oh I just got the  heebie jeebies  looking at that  wait that's not dirt  there's dirt in there  somewhere no  I don't think so  that gives me the

[02:46:30]  and all they do is  bite you and inject you  with venom  and you have to keep  the gloves on your hand  why would you do that  and their arms are black  when they pull them out  they're black from the venom  and this is just to  become a man  that's how Lisa Lampanelli  got in a fryer squad  in her car  and then you die  what happened to just  fucking abroad  to become a man  they had to go through  this ritual 20 times  20 times  they're very bored over there  what's this guy doing  let me see  it says fun with fire ants

[02:49:30]  by hundreds of  burning hot needles  it's black  but removing them  from the gloves  brings little relief  as others take  their turn  the pain begins  to build  she gave me  the key  it's black  his hand  yeah  these people  are stupid  yeah  savages  she'd do it on his  dick so it would  get black  and grow bigger  exactly  black's not from  the ants  what  I don't think  the black's from  the ants  yes it is  yeah  of course it is

[02:52:30]  when the natives do it  they have two on  and i guess they keep them on  longer  right  but they have to do that  twenty fucking times  over the course of a couple years  that's stupid  that's just dumb  it's kind of like contract negotiations  here  oh shit  swim walk  why don't they fucking mine something  or fucking build  or make ant hats and pants to go with it  so you can have an entire evening  of ant wear  why don't they make an ant brassiere for the ladies  maybe there's an end purpose  like it makes their hands better for digging or something 
[02:53:00]  never heard of such a thing  no  in person  in person  oh jeez  what a starvation  why don't they make an ant tie or something  you put it on  an ant tie  yeah  that'd be nice  yeah  no this is  why are people still doing this  it's 2011  I don't know  I would just be banging my fucking gloves  and squashing the ants  would you allow someone to step on your hand afterwards  ow  I don't know if we would add to it  or  I don't know if it could make it worse 
[02:53:30]  you imagine like a fucking  a bunch of angry ants  sting sting sting sting sting sting  sting sting sting  they don't sting and then go  alright we got them  get one mosquito bite  it ruins your night  fuck the bullet ants  bullet ants are fucking  right in there  and assholes  fucking assholes  he's not afraid  dude bullet ants are fucking  they don't play  brutal  yeah  I think they're the most brutal insect bite  it's worse than wasps and hornets  really  yeah I think so  boy do I not like getting stung by anything 
[02:54:00]  I think that a bullet ant  what is that Dan  he's just looking at shit  the more years I go without getting stung  the more fear I have of getting stung  of what  by anything  don't you want to be stung by  there's bees  any type of bees  bees is number one on my list  there's a certain spider bite  that saliva is so toxic  that it just eats your flesh  starts rotting your flesh away  none of us are going to the rainforest anytime soon  yeah exactly  there's a reason  I'm talking about shit in your own backyard  that's your number one fear  wasps 
[02:54:30]  I don't like bees  our immune system is used to any insect creature here  you know  there's no fucking thing that's going to kill you  I'd say a wasp is scariest  because  a hornet's bad  but a wasp  has that fucking dangling leg  when their legs are just  the legs dangle  yeah  they hurt  a wasp bite hurts  bumblebees don't sting at all  they're just annoying  they just  yeah but they're huge  they're just fat things  fat things  like fat shits  yeah  just getting in the way  these fucking bullet ants 
[02:55:00]  how do they fuck  if I was an ant  my dick would never stay hard  for another ant  I don't think they have to  how do they fuck  I don't know  I would hate to have to get some ant pussy  yeah  ant pussy  we're just looking at an ant  on a rock crawling around  and they just look like  they look like something  out of the Terminator  like those machines  yeah they do  they look very machine like  is that a dinosaur?  no  he's an insect  they find hell  and I'm very sexy  ants have been around  for quite a while though  is this the dinosaurs? 
[02:55:30]  I don't know  maybe  I don't know  insects  yeah yeah  I think so  probably  that motherfucker  yeah they've been around  for a while  he will bite you  they're probably big though  looks like a normal ant  yeah  everything was bigger though  it's like yeah  they've been around  since you know  the prehistoric times  it's like  sharks have been around  since prehistoric times  but you know  they were fucking  the size of a building  yeah they were  giant things  they were back then  ants oh yeah  ants were fucking  and saber tooth tigers  and shit like that  yeah  everything was just  giant back then  yeah  woolly mammoth 
[02:56:00]  all scary  I don't know why  they can't make a mammoth now  just take some DNA  from that fucking  bones or some of that  mammoth flesh  that they find frozen  and then shoot it  into a goddamn elephant  you don't need to  just give an elephant  a fucking raccoon lodge hat  here you go fatso  not go embarrass yourself  let it work  our board  mammoth  you fucking mammoth  you know how humiliated  an elephant would be  if he just taped hair to it  big greek elephant  running around 
[02:56:30]  that's stavros  the elephant  stavros  I don't know why  they can't do that though  get the DNA  from the mammoth  and then put it  into the nucleus  of an egg  from an elephant  they can  Jurassic Park  was actually possible  that's why  you're saying that  it's getting closer  that they can get the shot  but why would they  we wouldn't want  dinosaurs now  I would love them  they would do exactly  what they did in the movie  yeah really  run amok  a velociraptor  run amok  in water parks  and fucking parades  and memorial day events 
[02:57:00]  yeah  kill Jeff Goldblum  immediately  we got a guy  that got bit by  one of these bullet ants  Nick in Jersey  Nick  hi Nick  you're on the phone  ow  ow  Nick  hello  it's cunt  he's gone  his friend Tommy  maybe the bullet ant  broke his phone  Tommy  was it a hollow point  yeah I don't want  to deal with those  what are you promoting  Otto by the way  I'm doing  I'm working on  an internet 
[02:57:30]  variety show  called the Otto  and George  Pig Roast  we got a studio  in Hoboken  Hoboken  yeah  got a house band  called A Brues  and the Squatters  I'm going to have  guests on  I'd love to have  you guys on  I don't have  wow damn  right now we're  rehearsing  we're doing  just  I'm practicing  the art of interviewing  which you guys have  obviously  20 years  failed that miserably  it's not easy  it's not easy to do  I'm learning that  I'm learning just how  to walk out 
[02:58:00]  on stage  to a band play  you know  what do you do  you know  think Fredo  entering a room  in the Godfather  dance  yeah  I should do the Fredo dance  yeah  alright  get out of here  get the hell out of here  scram  no matter what  I look schmucky  and awkward  and unprofessional  what are you wearing  when you do it  I haven't decided yet  he's pretty fucking hot  in that studio right now  they haven't cranked  the air up yet  but that's what I'm working on  it's going to be cool  I'm going to get 
[02:58:30]  Pan and Teleron  Louis Black  Jimmy said he would do it  very cool  Copperfield eventually  it's in Hoboken  you're going to do interviews  and what are you going to  you're not going to have  an audience  you're going to have an audience  we're going to do  mock cutaways  to an actual audience  because  right now  the place is too  it's not big enough  to have an audience  and it's going to be  more of  we're not ripping off  the Larry Sanders show  but there's going to be  a lot of subtext  to the show  for instance  George 
[02:59:00]  every week  I'm auditioning  a new guy  to be like  the Ed McMahon  but in reality  George is trying  to replace me  on the show  with another guy  so there's like  that subtext  once it's shot  yeah  once it's shot  and I can show  you an episode  I think  I think you'll be impressed  how many episodes  are you doing  I don't know  we're going to start  I guess with six  or five or six  something like that  before I invite  a guest of importance  on  you know what I mean 
[02:59:30]  I want to get the kinks out  but I think people  are going to the internet  for entertainment now  and they're not  watching TV  you know  the fuck  it is true  there's nothing  worth fucking watching  on  it's very rare  you get something  it's got to be  on a cable outlet  or something  because regular TV  just sucks up  fucking dick  Paul Reiser's show  was good though  the guy that's  producing this  his name is  Bobby Capelli  he made six  independent films  I did one of them  it's called  Rules for Men  I was in it  with Florentine 
[03:00:00]  and Martling  was in it  and fucking  Kamal from  the Jerky Boys  and Frank Gorshin  it was a really  it was a very  low budget comedy  is he alive  still in Frank Gorshin  or did he die  Frank Gorshin's dead  I hope he's dead  they buried him  but anyway  Frank Gorshin was great  in 12 Monkeys  oh  where he's like  really good  he's looking  trying to figure out  where fucking  the guy went  he was a very  intense fucking  Bruce Willis 
[03:00:30]  comedian  yeah  yeah  it was like  he did really  good impressions  yeah he's dead  and he was like  he had the kind  of a  he wasn't like  just your regular  impressions that  would turn around  and fucking  it might look  something like this  right  he was like  intense  yeah  yeah exactly  scary  he scared me  as a child  watching him  he was a little  frightening  yeah  sure  you used to  curl up  and go  help  the Riddler's  gonna bite my  fanny  it was very  frightening  sure I'd have  to protect  your fanny  I'd put my 
[03:01:00]  hands on your  bottom  and I'd cup it  the whole point  of this fucking  thing is to get  people to go  to the website  that's the  that's the whole  main thing  with this shit  you gotta let  people have to  find out about it  so I'm gonna be  attacking that guy  Tosh  that Tosh guy  on Pumper Central  so by attacking him  if he acknowledges  that my show exists  then I'll get a little  press from that  that usually works  yeah  do you not like him  you don't like him  no I don't care  one way or the other  I just wanted to  acknowledge that my  show is on  when it's on  yeah that's the way 
[03:01:30]  to go about it  so we're gonna start  just as it gets  hot as fuck out  we're gonna start  filming  this guy's gonna  torture me in the  studio  but it is  that's a fucking  air conditioning  sounds exciting  the internet is like  I'm working very hard  I've been to this  place like  three days a week  just going down  there and just  practicing with the  band  getting a rapport  going with the  band  it's a shot  are you coming out  with George every time  are you holding  George  yeah unfortunately  I'm still a  ventriloquist  so you're  it's gonna be 
[03:02:00]  my slant on a  talk show  I'll do an  interview  and then George  will either say  it's boring  or they're full of  shit  or he wants to  fuck them  who have you  interviewed so far  just like Trish  and people you  know  well today  I got my buddy  Mr. Will  who's backstage  he's an underground  genius comic  and my friend  Johnny Elwood  so is Frank Gorshin  underground  plate dead  yeah so we're  doing two mock  interviews today  and filming it  just to see if I 
[03:02:30]  can pull it off  you know  I'm an unqualified  talk show host  but this guy  believes I can do it  but that's fucking  that's one of the  best things  I don't want to  inject myself into  it  but I'm gonna  first of all  the internet thing  is a great idea  I think we're right  at the beginning  of this whole  fucking movement  to get the fuck  off of regular  like what they've  been shoving  down our throats  and with no  options whatsoever  and now there's  so many options  and it's good  to be able to  be one of those  options  and I do  like that compound 
[03:03:00]  show from my  basement  and I want it  to look as  professional as  possible  like it looks  like a set  and I spent  money on lighting  and green screening  and everything  but be as  unprofessional as  possible in the  execution of it  because I'm  fucking sitting  there in a  professional set  studio  at night  but I'm drinking  I'm drunk  half the time  I'm doing it  I watch the next  day I gotta cut  the half out  because I can't  even watch it  because I'm  slurring  I'm a fucking  mess  but that's the  shit that's  like that's 
[03:03:30]  fantastic  do you have  guests on  to talk to  or you  sometimes just  friends hanging  out  or my chick  will sit down  and fucking  babble about  something  and I'll  call an idiot  how do I  see this show  plug  it's on  Ustream  Ustream  you just  search live  from the  compound  and I'm  on that  and actually  what I'm  going to be  doing  this week  she'll remember  that I won't  yeah live  from the  compound  Ustream  do I put  down Anthony  Cumia or  anything  no you just  put live  from the 
[03:04:00]  compound  and it'll  pop up  this week  I'm going  to do  because now  I have  virtual  televisions  behind me  so I  can sit  there  at a  desk  it looks  like a  fucking  desk  a complete  virtual  set  and on  the screen  behind me  I put  like the  Casey  Anthony  trial  and I'm  going to  be doing  some  coverage  of that  so yeah  my own  take on  it  is your  objective  with this  is just  for fun  or are you  looking for  money  just for  fun right 
[03:04:30]  now  I want  some of  that  fucking  Bill Gates  cash  he has  a fucking  green screen  that's great  I did a show  once  and he was  doing the  intro  and it was  like you  couldn't  see me  at all  he had  a green  he had  a green  blanket  over him  and then  just poked  his ass  through  so it's  Jimmy's  floating ass  just out of  nowhere  it looked like  a ghostly  ass floating  in the  it was as if  heaven had  fallen to  the earth  in the form  of floating  asses  that's what it 
[03:05:00]  looks like  there you go  that's part of  the  and that isn't  even  I'm HD  now  outside  Jim  Jim  has a  very  cute  round  hairless  ass  yeah  that whole  set is  virtual  there's  nothing  behind  us  but a  green  screen  or substance  there's no  substance  either  in lieu of  talent  but it  makes it  great  because it's  just like  it looks  so unprofessional  wow  have you guys  noticed that  transvestite  commercial  early on 
[03:05:30]  the super  bowl  yeah  where people  are they  going to be  offended  I saw that  and I thought  someone's  going to get  pissed  at that  some  anti  oh my god  oh my god  holy shit  wow  oh my god  that was really bad  Bobby farted  I can tell  wow  that was brutal  that's a real  that's a fucking  that's a meat fart  oh god  yeah  he does that  when he's nervous  kind of like  phone lines  an 800 number  she's now on the 
[03:06:00]  other side of a  glass looking in  it's like a  was it bad  it's like a  biohazard  thing  she should  have those  those  those sleeves  that you put  your arms through  to do things  not that  sleeves  I was trying  to do that  the whole show  I almost shit  my pants  twice  it wasn't worth  it  you gotta take  the risk  this guy's all  about risk  how come  like for instance  this radio show  isn't also like  oh  Jesus  why would you say that  why don't you go  down the hall  and get yourself 
[03:06:30]  an office  oh is that  a bad idea  no it's just  it's one of those  things that  people in this  business  they're just begging  us to leave  is what it  is your answer  they're begging  us to leave  they're forcing  us to cultivate  other means  they don't  they don't see  they don't see  what this could be  in the future  this  of course  this should have  a visual element  we've been saying  for years  and everyone else  doing podcasts  have the visual  element  they're begging  us to just  fucking leave  after this  the online  feed  is constantly  broken  gigantic  I don't understand  why would we  stay here  if we could do 
[03:07:00]  better stuff  somewhere else  the online feed  is always  forward to the  contract being  up  yes  I didn't know  that  if you need  to know  yeah I didn't  know that  I knew you  were mad  about the deal  that they struck  but I  whatever  we had to move  on from that  and of course  we were mad  they treated us  like shit  but we're still  just doing radio  when there's so  much other stuff  going on out there  and we went to  them with the  ideas  I'm dumb  as a bag  of hammers  I knew you guys  weren't happy  with the last  contract  but fuck  as long as 
[03:07:30]  you're in some  form  a lot of people  can't live without  you  you got guys  below us  that are doing  way more  because they got  the audio  and they got  the visual  a visual  aspect  we used to  have the visual  and they took  it away from us  we had how many  cameras  eight  digital cameras  every morning  remote control  we were able  to move them  around  but for some  reason  they just  took all that  away  throw them  one of those  Sonny Corleone  beatings  where you're  smashing him  in the face  with a garbage  pan lid  hit him 
[03:08:00]  with a shoe  bite his hand  yeah anything  he's so angry  half the shots  of missing  the guy  he's so pissed  off  greatest beating  ever  there's your  answer  you don't even  really know  this business  that well  and you see it  everyone sees it  but for some  reason  why is the  online player  does not work  I get so many  tweets  it's happening  today  but I mean  dude I get  them every day  people will see  the online play  these are adorable  that plus a  fucking visual  element would be  very good  that's my diet 
[03:08:30]  coke  I have a  smaller bottle  of diet  a lot of people  tweeting that they  can't listen  online again  today  we got that  problem in the  car  Trish loves  listening to the  show on the  way back from  work she's  pissed off  the only reason  I have fucking  serious  reasons  the only reason  is because  of Opie and  Anthony  where the  fuck is it  and now  the guy  goes  this is a  month later  you gotta  bring the  car to the  shop  why did  you tell  me that  a month ago  what  and why  by the way

[03:09:30]  airs on this  show airs in  the replay  maybe it's  coming from  somewhere  maybe it's  the online  feed  they didn't  change  could be  I don't know  what runs  on the online  I bet you  it's the  online feed  that they  didn't  change up  I think  that fucking  web  there's so  many mistakes  on the  website  people keep  saying  this is wrong  that's wrong  the Boneyard  Facebook page  is no good  everything's  good  everything's fine  don't worry  about it  that's not  true  everything's fine  and dandy  I love the  picture in the  office of  Richard Dreyfuss  you're staying  next to him  and you're  like some  hooligan

[03:14:30]  his twitter  got hacked  and it  wasn't him  but now  it's starting  to look like  he was  following  some people  that he  probably  shouldn't  have been  anyone  that has  twitter  knows  it's  bullshit  really  oh yeah  yeah  I may have  been wrong  by the way  twitter  just corrected  me  some guy  goes  stop  talking  about  bullet  ants  the  black  is  from  ash  to  protect  them  sort  of  doesn't  work  so I  may have  been  incorrect  oh sorry  I heard  that the  black  thing  is to  make  them  bite  yeah  whatever  it is  I was  wrong  saying  it was  from  the  poison  yeah  to be  ash  to  make 
[03:15:00]  them  bite  that  helps  make  them  bite  I don't  think  it seems  like  they don't  need  to  help  to bite  exactly  they're  encased  in a glove  they're already  cranked  you know  how annoyed  they hate  being in  gloves  they're very  passive  in mittens  they like  mittens  they do  because they're  in a half  circle  and that  calms  the ant  there's a  half  circle  there's  something  about it  typically  they're  pixelating  the underwear  shot  oh I thought  that was  his pubes  pushing forward  lewd pick 
[03:15:30]  of man  in underwear  sent from  represent  wieners  talking about  for a couple  of days  I'm not  going to  allow it  to decide  what I  talk about  for the next  two weeks  the objective  of the person  who is doing  the mischief  is to try  to distract  me from  what I do  I made a  decision  I'm not  going to let  it happen  today  he refuses  to answer  any more  questions  but he did  deny it  why don't you  tell me  what's my  best  profile  yeah  the honeymoon

[03:19:00]  Look at the time.  Meeting time.  Holy fuck on a stick.  Language.  Otto, this was a great  hour and a half, sir.  Yes.  I fucking killed it.  Otto.  OttoandGeorge.com.  OttoandGeorge on Twitter.  Yeah, look for this pig roast.  I don't have any website  for it yet.  I'm gonna be at Bananas  July 9th in Hasbrook Heights,  too.  The great Otto and George.  Right.  But things are happy.  Oh, I'm doing something  with that Coke Logic guy,  too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's good.  Hopefully it involves a gym.  He's great.  He's a big boy. 
[03:19:30]  Is he a big fat pig?  Hopefully it involves a gym.  Exactly.  He's a big boy.  I gotta feed him  and clothe him.  Is he a real, really,  a real noinker?  He's very talented.  He sure is.  He really is.  Do you ever do  aerial photographs of him?  Oh, God.  He's a noinker.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  I got a goddamn meeting  or some shit.  You're listening  to Opie and Anthony  on The Virus
