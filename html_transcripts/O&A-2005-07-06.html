<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and Jim Norton engaging in their characteristically crude and nonsensical banter, including a shockingly offensive joke about targeting children with Down Syndrome.  Technical difficulties briefly interrupted the flow before the conversation shifted to the death of James Stockdale, focusing on his memorable (and erratic) vice-presidential debate performance.  The unexpected arrival of Colin Quinn in the studio added to the comedic chaos, with further exchanges about invitations and Quinn's personal hygiene.

The show then jumped to a discussion of recent news stories: a hate crime involving a stabbing, the ongoing antics of “Fat Nick,” and a detailed breakdown of Bruce Kelly's emotional on-air meltdown during Live 8's coverage of The Who.  Audio clips of Kelly's outburst were played, along with commentary from other personalities. A caller voiced negative opinions about The Who, citing the guitarist's past child pornography involvement.  Other topics included the Coney Island hot dog eating contest, the lack of public outrage over the hate crime, speculation about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, blind item gossip, and a caller's account of an HIV-positive Muppet appearing at a Live 8 event. The segment concluded with a discussion of a previous incident involving Colin Quinn accosting a female news reporter.  The entire segment was rife with profanity, racial slurs, and offensive jokes.

The next segment delved into celebrity gossip: a newlywed husband's visits to gay bars after an award show, a leading man securing his fiancée's affection with a $10 million contract, and a foreign-born athlete suspected of lying about his age.  This transitioned into a discussion of a VH1 malfunction that allowed a curse word to air, leading to a call from Scorch, a former colleague.  Still with Colin Quinn in studio, Scorch recounted his bizarre firing from a previous radio job (involving a hamburger/pizza analogy), detailed his current Syracuse radio show, “Rock 105 the Dog,” and his "Naked Militia" online community.  Scorch performed a live break for his show, showcasing his on-air style, including a "gay play of the day" segment.  Further discussion included bad radio, listener participation, a clip of Stalker Patty subjected to a vibrator controlled by Anthony, Colin Quinn's stand-up shows, Opie's STDs, Opie's planned trip to Los Angeles (and potential porn set encounters), Colin Quinn's concurrent appearances on other radio shows,  audio clips of Paul Anka arguing with his band, listener-submitted news teases (analyzed and critiqued by the hosts and Quinn), and past stunts involving the hosts' "retarded Laverne & Shirley" characters at the MTV Video Music Awards.

The following segment centered on a disastrous in-studio bit involving a mealy orange and a Lysol can, resulting in a messy orange juice explosion.  This was followed by a substantial discussion of Colin Quinn's impending departure to Sirius Satellite Radio.  Quinn discussed his meeting with Sirius, expressing both excitement and apprehension.  The hosts jokingly lamented his loss, speculating on contract details and making crude jokes.  Listener calls offered opinions on news teases, and the Live 8 concert was briefly revisited. The segment also included discussion about Atlantic City, a boat trip, and personal anecdotes.  The alleged incident of a new intern pulling the microphone from Quinn's hands fueled further comedic discussion. The segment ended with Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" and a discussion of satellite versus terrestrial radio, including criticisms of Mancow Muller.

The final segment featured numerous listener calls expressing dissatisfaction with certain XM satellite radio channels ("Fred," "Deep Tracks"), comparing them unfavorably to "Lucy" and "Boneyard."  Listeners complained about the lack of familiar songs and the obscurity of the music selections. The hosts debated the merits of deep tracks versus popular songs, with some listeners defending the deeper cuts.  The conversation included discussion of the firing of Katrini from the Danza show, speculation about its future and a potential Gloria Estefan replacement, mention of a cover band competition,  Green Day's cover of Queen's "We Are the Champions," and concluded with The Who's "Won't Get Fooled Again."  The hosts also promoted upcoming live shows and merchandise. The entire segment was characterized by an informal, irreverent, and vulgar tone.

[00:04:30]  I'm big, big, big black.  I'm big, big black.  No, I'm big, big black.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  That's terrific!  Mom!  I love no one, I have to do this now. 
[00:05:00]  old school oh that is really old and my mic's really loud yeah what happened i don't know  and i'm like blasting also what do you mean what happened yeah i know we took a few days off that's  what happened a few days off the gremlins come in here and screw with knobs i'll turn everything  down yeah you knob we're peeking like crazy here we peeking we're peeking what are you peeking at  oh a little uh uh uh gauges meters 0.6 we're running at 0.6 0.6 megapixels 
[00:05:30]  megapixels whatever the hell that thing measures let me turn down the uh megapixels the thingy  isn't that great when you look at a gauge and you have no idea what it really measures you know  where it's supposed to be but no idea what it's actually measuring i don't know what that does 
[00:06:00]  i bet you it's measuring our brain cells good morning and welcome to the opian anthony program  the ona virus spreading across america yes indeed what's up anthony ah well we're back  that was nice waking up early again this morning because i i uh i like uh waking up early during  vacation to keep myself in the rhythm of things so it's so easy to wake up uh when we go back to  work there he is it's completely impossible to do i'm obsessed with the fact that uh james stockdale 
[00:06:30]  died oh not many people know who james stockdale was he was a fine american he was the uh he was  ross perot's running mate who made a complete ass out of himself during the uh during the uh debate  with al gore back in what 92 yeah ross figured he'd get him a war hero and uh he got him well he got  someone that was shell-shocked that was the problem a little past his prime and he had a hard time  public uh speaking and god bless everyone that uh defends this country but uh ross perot found one 
[00:07:00]  of the ones that was uh a little loose in the noggin a little shell-shocked and it turns out that he  died of um pretty much alzheimer's disease yeah uh james stockdale the former pow and political  novice uh who served as ross perot's running mate in 92 has died the navy announced yesterday he was  81 and had been suffering from alzheimer's disease uh in a memorable vice presidential debate against uh  dan quayle and al gore the little-known stockdale got a big laugh with his opening line 
[00:07:30]  who am i why am i here yeah remember that he just walked up to the mic who am i why am i here  ah that's a good question and then that became fodder for snl i believe right yeah and then uh he went  on to give a stumbling performance the paper is saying today yeah so but it was memorable when um  when a dan quayle started uh quoting uh john f kennedy and he came back with that line you know 
[00:08:00]  i knew jack kennedy i worked with jack kennedy and that was stockdale right mr quayle you are no jack  kennedy crap that's right yeah anthony yeah that was like that was the most memorable moment that kind  of saved him from completely like screwing it up and then quayle stood there and was like  that's uncalled for that was uncalled for and then that was a beautiful knockout punch i'm trying to find  the audio because didn't he have something crazy to say about abortion or something i think he held  up a fetus right there at the podium bit its head off i think this is what i did in the nom 
[00:08:30]  they're asking him what his stance on abortion was and he said something like uh uh if you get  knocked up have an abortion yeah it was something really bad really brutal maybe we could get the  transcript at least if we don't have the audio people were so outraged by his performance on so  many levels and uh i remember i was a young go go getter back in 92 and i was and i was hoping for  some kind of a ross perot type figure to kind of mix it up yeah and then stockdale was on tv and you're 
[00:09:00]  like oh boy oh boy back in the old days when you thought maybe something new could get in there  instead of just the usual suspects trading office every uh four years or eight years i was hoping  yeah something different as a younger uh human being yeah and you just get old and jaded and  realize it's the same dickhead that's in there every friggin time so but uh we lost a war hero is  what it comes down to he flew 201 missions in vietnam 201 missions he flew yeah oh and he dies 
[00:09:30]  crapping himself with alzheimer's and was the highest ranking naval officer captured in the war by the  way really so he was a true war hero there is colin quinn what the fuck all right colin this is so  early for colin colin colin come staggering in here i didn't what are you doing here so early  you're coming in you are up early let me just explain one thing because i understand he just said  he told me opie was there i saw him the other night he goes hey man come by the show this week

[01:15:00]  though oh all right call scorch back tell him to stop kissing her ass oh i thought he made a good  point no matter what the job is you know you gotta your boss hires you hey you know just get through  now you can explain why he loves scorch colin i know i love him because i just love the you know  the whole thing of it it's just like when i first met lady diane marion i just had that feeling it's like 
[01:15:30]  you know he's just there in syracuse doing radio no it's just like if you see if you if you see  somebody getting like beaten in the street yeah you know and it's just like sickening but it's beautiful  right now he's going to humble pie he sounded like a beaten man though there was a time i know  scorch really believed in what he was doing he was doing a lot of hacky type radio but he believed  but we all get jaded yeah no he's he's jaded the rest he's now a beaten man yeah all right here we go 
[01:16:00]  oh here he is oh come on just throw him on thank you scorch what's up ab sorry about that so you  when are you breaking i'm breaking in 50 seconds so why don't you uh just hold on just a couple seconds  and i'm gonna well why don't you make your point i don't know what happened with the phone there  oh oh my point was that uh even that if you are the worst going on here i hear weird things  happening what happened scorch uh the whole thing was if if somebody hires you to do your job and 
[01:16:30]  they're paying you to hold on one second let's get this break going hang on we're going to be live  all right syracuse you guys are you lucky all right here we go we get to hear scorch  doing a live break in syracuse new york this is why regular radio sucks by the way he'll prove our  point syracuse's rock station it is the best the classic rock and the best new rock  ozzy time after time it's rock 105 the dog and it is 20 minutes after eight and we're looking at 73 
[01:17:00]  going up to about 77 does that have more than one song well that's the only one we play because  shoot yourselves crap kickbacks don't you know i think that the uh kill yourselves guy in charge  is a cindy lopper fan he thought originally when he saw time after time he's like cindy lopper playing  and he's just pissed off and lazy now that he doesn't uh do his job he doesn't take it out because  he's just a lazy slob but he gets paid more than we do bed music for christ's sake he's cleaning 
[01:17:30]  person at mcdonald's he's paid more than we do uh it's rock 105 the dog on the way today live with  the militia we still have more where the hell are they now wednesday including uh where the hell  are they now wednesday free all right now and uh blinded by the light i think man for man man  also the gay play of the day today everybody always jokes about gay music oh we don't know that that's  gay you say that's gay oh that's queer but you know the words don't you so the game play of the day 
[01:18:00]  today has to do with the uh village people and you were singing along when we were but we're not going to  do ymca though because everybody knows that one so that's on the way plus whatever else you want  you know it is your phone show your listener driven phone show live with the naked militia  and uh it is the syracuse's rock station without seeing the computer can i guess what we have coming  up next yeah pink floyd zeppelin and some three doors down close enough uh eric clapton guns and roses 
[01:18:30]  this is like the elephant graveyard we're listening to where jocks go to die syracuse new york no  shit wow so that was radio in syracuse wow scorch that was fascinating what's the gay play of the  day uh just what we said we play uh everybody always jokes about gay music so we play a band that's  predominantly gay and then we let people sing along to it because everybody knows the words  the gay songs but who's gay besides village people queen oh queen uh billy squire judas priest uh 
[01:19:00]  judas priest oh by the way this is just a legend so if anybody's listening i don't want to be sued  for slander uh judas priest uh uh boy george boy george stuff like that billy squire's a mo yeah you  didn't know that no no uh billy squire he got his name because billy squire he lost his whole credibility  because he did that video was on the pink uh uh silk uh bed oh really yeah the way he was crawling in  that video you couldn't tell i don't know that video that's why lonely was the night because his 
[01:19:30]  gay bar closed lonely was it i do like the fact that you guys played time after time that's a good  song oh thanks man aussie's version are you kidding me not 72 times a day it ain't but that's true scorch  send a tape to uh charlie logan at the boneyard on xm you'd be perfect no doubt we got to get you out of  syracuse yeah you i'll tell you what you will have that all right i will definitely do that and  you know what it's been a pleasure being on your show thank you scorch and uh thank you for letting

[01:21:00]  listener yeah and a listener sings along to it get it no i don't either  you know what i would do if i had my own radio show i'd uh have everybody go into like you know  some kind of like a one of those uh furniture stores like ethan allen and jump on the couch like tom  cruise oh like tom cruise did on oprah that'd be funny right that'd be hysterical all right what would 
[01:21:30]  the store do you know would they kick you out would you know listen to the guy trying to explain what  he's doing yeah be great and he played risky like uh uh what's the the song they played risky business  all right the stupid box seeker song in the background rock and roll or the top gun theme  something like that something cruisish sorry let's say hi to josh and pa josh what's up hey what's up  hey scourge said uh where the hell are they now wednesdays is he giving out w-t-h-a-t-n-w bumper

[01:35:30]  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars  So that women would take their clothes off in the cars  Dude, get with it  Alright, well, I mean  Give me an original idea  Come on  I mean, I know  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car  I mean, I've done it all  What about going off on their car?  I totally know that's you  Alright, okay, whatever  I gotta go  Please, I don't really want to get into a discussion like this  He's so delusional  That is really funny  Someone found the clip  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show 
[01:36:00]  Because of the gag order that he placed on us  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one  That's a big bandana  What's the matter?  My car has cancer  People throwing frisbees to their cars  Jumping, grabbing  God, just showing your age, man  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore  It's all hippied out  You honk the horn, sleep  Beep, beep  Dude  Oh, dude 
[01:36:30]  He's so delusional  Oh, man  Just admit it  Wow, it's such an original idea  I invented everything  I've done it all  He even said, I've done it all  Wow  Even the stuff that's going to be invented  I did it already  There's no real idea  I went into a time machine  And I already did it  I've done it all  I was the first one to do anything  Crap  Marconi ripped me off, Robin  Remember the  What was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code  It was Howard code

[01:37:30]  Girls would get naked in the car  It wasn't even flat  Girls would get naked  Driving, taking their clothes off  Crashing into a butt  Mr. Robin  I invented a traffic accident  A bandana around an antenna  That reminds me of something else I've heard  It's called a fucking flag  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention  I invented that, Robin  They say Betsy Ross did that  I sewed the stars on  Ooh, it was all me  I don't care  I don't care  I honestly don't care

I have my own radio show here in Virginia  And y'all were talking about listening to Wacky Radio  I just finished editing a whole bunch of stuff on it  So I figured I'd play it for you  What radio?  Is it college radio?  Well, it's AM radio  But I've actually been on some clear channel stations and stuff  And done morning zoos and all that awful stuff  Yeah?  Yeah  Alright, let's see your 
[01:39:00]  Well, what show are we listening to?  It's called The Worst Radio Show Ever  See, we had a public access TV show called The Worst Television Show Ever  Ah, took the radio and you were thinking maybe you'd get the worst movie ever  Right  Yeah, sure  Let's hear it  We'll write the book  Alright, here it is  Yeah  The Worst Radio Show Ever  We are  It's definitely what we are  Well  Oh boy  It's been an exciting weekend  It was July 4th  We have a lot to talk about because it was July 4th 
[01:39:30]  Everybody did exciting things  What did you do for July 4th, Ashley?  I got drunk  You got drunk?  That's what a lot of people do on July 4th  I was swimming  Drinking and swimming  What a safe combination  And sliding  The name definitely fits  Swimming  Wow  We could have washed it to a mudslide, it sounds like  Troy, what did you do for your weekend?  Uh, I got drunk and I went to work  Wow  I, uh, I feel left out  I didn't drink her for the weekend  I, uh, I considered it at one point 
[01:40:00]  That isn't even so bad it's good  Kind of  It's just  Sometimes stuff is really bad  That is just horrible  That makes it good  Right  I gotcha  We got the audio of Stalker Patty  This is the one where we're molesting the shit  Out  Finally  You alright, Colin?  Are these for me?  I like these  I guess  Oh, Steve C brought those in, yeah  Where are they?  I love that  More porno  I like violent videos and stuff that's, you know  You like that stuff?  I love it  I just like the sex stuff  Really?  I like the fights 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, I don't need it to be violent or anything  I need the fights  Yeah?  Yeah  What kind of fight videos?  Well, this is like almost illegal  You know, fights in parking lots and stuff  Oh, things like that  Yeah, that's fine  No, that's  That's like  Chicks that are young  It's not chicks  It's guys fighting  No, there's more than that  No, there's girls  Yeah?  There's more than that in those videos  Well, it's almost illegal  Violent, sexy video will shock you  There's probably a couple of tits popping out there in girl fights or something  Yeah, but I like to see the fight fights  Steve, what are these videotapes about that Colin has in his hand? 
[01:41:00]  They're a lot of fight, a lot of street fights  Yeah  Are they real?  Yeah, no, they're real  I guess they're operating under the principle that if it happens in public, you can videotape it  And you can own it  There's a lot of these around  And there's a company out on the West Coast sent those in and it's just a lot of street fights  A lot of like  But how are they just walking around catching fights?  Everybody's got a camera these days  Everybody's got a video camera  But it's like, if you look at the crowd that's got this kid  It's a bunch of drug, gratuitous drug using teens or 20 year olds, 20 somethings college students 
[01:41:30]  Cholos and stuff, fights  Smashing each other's faces in  They probably get them off websites too or have people send them in  It's not the same guy videotapes  Yeah, a lot of them have the same people in them  Oh, sorry  Sorry  It's like in England, they slap people in the street  Slap happy  You ever heard of that?  Yeah, yeah  Well, we know slap happy for another reason  Yeah, it's another video collection  Dave, why don't you explain slap happy to Colin Quinn?  Slap happy  The American version  Yeah, slap happy was a series of porn videos 
[01:42:00]  By a friend of Jimmy's of mine named Brandon  Who was basically slapping women in the face  As he got head  As he got head  And making them have the C word on their forehead as they're giving head  That's why we lost the Olympics, by the way  But wait a minute  So I slap happy  And they're slap happy  But she'd slap him while they're blowing him  That sounds very dangerous  No, but he's an animal  He would pull out of their mouth, slap him in the face  Oh  And plunge that monster back in until they throw up  Smack him with his monster  But if he's really a monster, he'd leave it in there and slap him and take his chance  Oh, he would do it 
[01:42:30]  He got bit many times  They'd puke  He'd do it  They'd puke  Now, whose videos are these?  Do you put them in front of me?  Because I've got them or are you trying to give them a show?  I mean, you can have them if you want  Now it just feels weird like they weren't for you  They're so not for you  That's Steve's only copy, but he has no way of telling you  Is that your only copy?  They send them to the show  They're not mine  How many did they send?  Just those two  So why don't you just tell Colin  Why don't you just have our only copy?  Be polite  Oh, did you want to?  I'm sorry  I don't know you guys usually don't like this stuff 
[01:43:00]  I called Ben last night  Thank you, exactly  I'm the one that brought it up  Nobody even thinks about it  Exactly  But don't you want to go through it for the show, maybe?  Or bring it home for yourself?  Sure  If you would like, we can go through them  Can I have a...  Ask him for his wallet  I'll probably give it to you, Colin  No  Jesus  Alright, let's give the Stalker Patty audio a listen  Oh yeah  I wish I had the video of this, too  Yeah, hot  Basically, again, this is us forcing Stalker Patty to...  To get another  To try out this remote control vibrator where Anthony was holding the remote  And she was getting stimulated in her... 
[01:43:30]  I don't know, it was in her panties or something  You were absolutely crazy  Hold on  You ready?  Tie her hands!  Oh God  Hold on, hold on  Because we don't want you to take the thing off  Yeah  It's about time you have a little fun  I've had enough of that panic face  Are we holding her...  I don't know how scared I am  Why?  No one's going to hurt you?  Not yet  Oh my God  What are you doing?  No, no  It's laughing  Come on, Patty  He'll have to... 
[01:44:00]  He's going to have to tase you  We'll get a tase you  No, you're scaring me now  This is really sick  No, you're scaring me now  You're scaring me now  You're scaring me  You're scaring me now  I'm scared of you, officer  This is the worst  She was a little nervous with that whole situation  It really was brutal  All that needed was a pinball machine  In the room  That propped her up on that  Yeah  Five guys in cowboy hats going  Mine doesn't fit either  Rotten virgin  I was going to go to a phone call 
[01:44:30]  And it just zapped away  Oh, brother  All right, well  Brian in Atlanta  I was going to go to him  All right, we can do the news teases next, Anthony  News teases  Well, I don't know  The, you know  Steve redid this  So hopefully it works  Yeah, the listeners are stupid  Is what it boils down to  Our listeners are just retarded  We've been doing this whole thing on news teasers  And how they just  Try to scare the shit out of you these days  Oh, yeah  Like, what car explodes when you step on the brake?  We'll tell you at 11  Right  You guys sit there  Spell it out, idiot 
[01:45:00]  We're sitting here  Your kids are at the soccer field  You're not sure if you should, you know  Take the car out  A food in your refrigerator could instantly kill you  Right  While your child is not safe  Yeah, if they really wanted to help  If it was news that they were there to help  And serve the public interest  They would tell you  But they're not  They're there for ratings  And then they try to have this holier-than-thou attitude  When you stand behind them  With a stupid Opie and Anthony sign  So we've been playing some of these news teasers  And it's been very successful 
[01:45:30]  But we just got a new batch  And the listeners have been sending these in  And now they don't get it  They're starting to send in ones that are just, you know  Fire in our area  Yeah, okay  It's a news story, idiot  Yeah  It doesn't fit the whole scheme of what we're talking about  We're talking about the fear  A restaurant you eat in  Could be spelling botulism for you and your family  And you're like, alright, that's a good one  But is it even better that they send in the awful ones and ruin everything?  They really, you know, these fucking idiots 
[01:46:00]  When you're trying to do radio, it gets very frustrating  When you know you have this great bit you can do  And it's going to take up a half hour  And then all of a sudden you realize that the dummies don't know how to do it  But part of the charm of this show is that that happens  Of us just bombing  Gunman broke into a jewelry store today and shot two  And made off with $50,000 in jewels  Yeah, okay  It's a news story, idiot  Now you can't make that funny  Yeah, exactly  Yeah  For example, we got an example of a bad one that was sent in  Oh, we do?  This is not what we're really looking for 
[01:46:30]  Local fire crews have been busy tonight  With the fear things will only get worse  We'll explain why coming up  That's actually pretty close  That kind of fits  It's almost there  That kind of fits  They're the worst ones  We'll explain why coming up  Right  But it's not the bit that we're looking for  And it just makes us a little frustrated  And it makes us want to just stop the bit  I know  You know, the listeners in their car right now going  Yeah, I get it  That's not really what the guys were looking for  Not totally  Here's another one  He could have killed me

[01:55:30]  I guess, yeah  They were wearing something underneath  Their little jackets that they wear  It's got to all match  I think it was the official  Opie and Anthony pest t-shirt  Do they have a pest t-shirt  That's available now?  Yeah, pre-ordering is happening now  If you go to opieandanthony.com  Alright, back to the news teases, Anthony  We're trying to get  Well, the deadly ice cream was close, right?  The deadly ice cream was right there  That was perfect  That's the one  I don't want this bitch to go away  The shark one  The shark was mediocre, too  I gotta be honest with you  Mediocre  Right now, thousands of area residents 
[01:56:00]  Are being told to turn off their caps  A mishap at a water treatment plant  Has authorities putting out a warning tonight  There you go  Come on, that's a good one  That's a good one  Thousands are area  Sitting there with a glass of water  You're making tea  Sitting there going  Ah, now what do I drink?  Yeah, what's the water treatment?  Yeah, that's the criteria  If it brings you into it  Right  And if you don't know  Like, they don't know which water treatment  They wouldn't even tell them  No  Right  Maybe you weren't listening when you were warned  Maybe you weren't home  It brings you into the story  Because they're not telling you where the story is 
[01:56:30]  That's what we're looking for  They tend to languish in vagaries  Very good  Not really, but  Nah, they do  It's always sarcastic when I say very good on this show  Good  I never, ever mean it  Good  Alright  Here's another one  Police are calling it an iPod crime wave  It's now claimed to lie  We'll have the latest  Well, killer iPods, right?  Is that good?  That's kind of scary  That's not a good one either?  No, that's not a good one  The last one was good  This one stinks 
[01:57:00]  Kind of is dangerous to have an iPod in the city  Yeah, but they're not saying  Find out why  They're just saying there's an iPod crime wave  Yeah  It could be any news story  That's true  I hate calling  Jesus, OB  You're the one that loves this bit  You don't even get it  I hate it  You don't even get it  You're like a buzzkill  We like this bit  I am a buzzkill  No, he's like the teacher  He's critiquing our work  You're going to go home  And tomorrow we're going to have to do  Battle of the Sexes  Some hack radio bit  Because you convinced our listeners  That this bitch stinks  I didn't say it stinks 
[01:57:30]  Can't do the news teasers anymore  I just don't think he's got a long shelf life  Alright, well let's try another one here  Boy, I ain't got the life  If you feel a bit more woozy  The next time you wine and dine  Beware  Join us as we uncork  Juiced up wine  Tonight at 6  What?  Juiced up wine  What about that one, Colin?  Yeah, that sounded like a big time  That sounded dangerous  Because I don't know  We have to hear that one again  Is it somebody slipping you a mickey?  Is it something in the wine when you buy it?  Is it something people are doing for their wine?  That fits in the thing  If you feel a bit more woozy  The next time you wine and dine 
[01:58:00]  Beware  Join us as we uncorked  Juiced up wine  That's a good one  It doesn't have the urgency of that day  But it's still  You know why?  I'll tell you something  I like to drink wine  And that just made me all nervous  Oh  So it works  Now you want to hear the story  Now I got to know  Is it something  They're slipping Mickey's in places  I don't know  That's true  Or is it in the wine?  They are slipping Mickey's in places  In 1938  Boy, I got the life expectancy  Of a house fly  You know that's from  You ever see a close range  Boy, I ain't got the life expectancy  Of a house fly  1938 
[01:58:30]  What's going to happen  If you drink too much wine?  Are you going to start complaining  That you have to wait to see Michael?  I can't believe that lobby  High in the Sierra Mountains  Champagne cocktails  I like that guy  Alright, do we like the juiced up wine?  We like it  But it's not our favorite  But it's good  That works  The last three or four  Were the ones that really  They fit  I think the fans are coming across 
[01:59:00]  Now they work  These aren't as good as the ones  We had last week  We had great ones last week  But they're good  I like them  How about this one  Coming in from Denver  Well, coming up tonight at 9.30  Just having one of these  Can cost you a lot of these  Depending on where you are  I'm Don Ward with the warning  Straight ahead in a live report  Well, that's perfect  What was he holding up?  Maybe he was holding something up  In one hand, it was a cock  And he said it can cost you a lot of these  In the next hand, it was a T-cell  Stupid 
[01:59:30]  Oh my God  You actually  What?  You just squished my orange  I wasn't going to eat it anyway  Because it's mealy and awful  You were preparing that orange  For the last ten minutes though  That's the beauty of what college is  Jimmy peeled his orange perfectly  Split it into two exactly equal segments  Put it on the napkin in front of him  Jimmy was even taking the little white off  Yeah, yeah  After you peeled your orange  And then he had to do his line  Which he was so confident about  That he didn't even stop Colin  From smashing his orange with a Lysol can 
[02:00:00]  And spraying juice on it  Like he could have stopped in the middle  But that line was so important to you  I actually didn't mind it  Because the line was horrendous  He was better because it was squirting on him  Oh, it smells all orangey  I didn't like it  I didn't expect such arousing success  It actually squirted his shirt  It got all over his shirt  That made a big mess  I didn't think it would be  That was a great  That was a great visual  Because it seemed like you were peeling  And preparing that orange  For a really long hour  It really was  It was starting to bug me more and more  Yeah  Can I have some water 
[02:00:30]  And a glass of water  And the  Because now you're sticky  Um, no, just for the table  Yeesh  And another orange maybe  Because that orange fucking blue  I hate sticky  Look at him  Trying to act like that orange blue now  Can I have another one?  It was mealy  I want one from another place  You would have been turned off on orange  You would have asked for an apple  I already ate my apple  You had an apple already?  Yeah  Wow, fruity guy  I like one of these  Can cost you one of these  Yes  Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out  What he was holding up  He had a cock in one hand  And then T-cells in the other  Well, coming up tonight at 9.30 
[02:01:00]  Just having one of these  Can cost you a lot of these  Depending on where you are  I'm Don Ward with the warning  Straight ahead in a live report  I picture him  Holding up a cock  And the warning sound that says  Get the heck out of the way  This ferry is not stopping  At 9.20  A runaway ferry  Well, it's a runaway ferry story  It's not every ferry runs away  Yeah  Oh, man  These guys did an awful job  With this bit while we were away 
[02:01:30]  They did  Can I have a little less water?  You're a little good  How much water did you get?  I don't know  Apparently there's a big shortage  I saw you're using a swasher  Shut up  That's where it comes to, Harry  I was afraid it's tap water  That's where it comes to  Actually, less than half a cup  Wow  Water that can kill you  Thanks  I like the fact that he highlighted it  With the red marker, too  Yeah  You kind of made the little line  On the outside of the cup, Jimmy  Oh, Harry is dumb  It's the new rage on the internet  But is your teenager's daily blog 
[02:02:00]  Opening them up to some very unwanted attention?  Ah  That counts  Yeah  I know it's not hilarious  But it fits the bill, at least  It's probably true, though  Your teenager has a blog  It's going to get people reading it  And, you know  Hey, you want to meet me at the train station?  You know what?  I think we have to give this bit back to Nathaniel and Danny  Yeah  They're right  They know how to do this bit right  And if the listeners are fortunate enough to send in some good ones  We'll play them tomorrow or Friday 
[02:02:30]  Wow  Yeah, give it back to the boys  Because I was excited for this bit today  You mean our employees, Opie?  Ah, that's right  Our employees, Nathaniel and Danny and Travis  Back  And Travis  Back with the Opie and Anthony show  Not interns anymore  They're now working  They are working for the program  Yeah, their first move was to divide and conquer on all those videos I was going to steal  They're spread out all over the place now  They're a good crew  Look at them  Whatever his name is and the other guy 
[02:03:00]  Oh, shit  Another fight one?  Yeah, we're going to get that bit back on the rails, Anthony  Yeah, please  Don't give it up  Don't give it up  Let's say hi to Dave in Ohio  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Dave  Hey, I know what the hidden danger was that the news teaser was talking about  It's Ben's hog  Which one?  Ben's hog was the hidden danger  Our producer is well endowed  Wow  What a 
[02:03:30]  Yeah  Well, we don't know  We don't know  There's just something going on in front of his pants  Really?  Look when he comes in here next time  He's got like a big bulge  But we can't tell if he's got those ridiculously big balls  Right, right  Those Boston balls  Or if it's a huge hog  No, I think Ben probably is a pretty big hog  Or he wears pampers  You think he's got a big hog?  I don't know  We'll see it  He is incontinent  Why don't you make him take it out?  No, we don't want to see it  Why not?  Speak for yourself  You want to see it?  Take a peek?  Why not?  You've got to take a peek to see what it's about  I bet it's got a really thin shaft and a fat, large head 
[02:04:00]  That's why he's embarrassed  Make him take it out right now  Like a big mushroom  It's one of those mysteries that we're trying to figure out on this program  Yeah  Matt and PA  What's up, Matt?  Hey, guys  Colin  Big fan  Love you on remote control  Jesus  You calling from a rotary phone?  Hey  I've seen on TV last night  They said  Is your kid playing baseball bat, Rush Roulette?  Find out at 11  There's a story about defective baseball bats 
[02:04:30]  That's a good one  See, that's what we're looking for  Stuff like that  And one more thing  Yeah  Ben's hog is so big  That Lady Di's husband thought it was a train  And jumped in front of it  I'll tell you how you just  That could have been better  You didn't have to say  Thought it was a train  You should have just said  Lady Di's husband jumped in front of it  Jumped in front of it  Now that's funny  Yeah, but you told too much  And over-explained  Yeah  Listen to the pros  Listen to how the pro gives you advice  That knows what he's talking about  I like that  I sure do  Because that did make it funny  That did make it funny 
[02:05:00]  Yeah  All right  K-words are funny  It's more inside joke, too  Gives you that inside thing  You want to talk about Atlantic City  Before we go to break?  I had a great time in Atlantic City  Went there over the weekend  Holiday weekend  Went to the Borgata  Borgata  You ever been there?  Sure  It's beautiful  Isn't it nice?  It's away from a lot of the riffraff  They got the Borgata babes in there  Yeah  Which are indeed babes  They got the hottest  I went a couple  I went a couple of weeks ago  And I had to stay  I made reservations real late 
[02:05:30]  So the only place that had rooms available  Was the Tropicana  Yeah  And it is the worst  I went there  And the waitresses walking around  Were in their 50s  And I'm not exaggerating  I'm not just  They were in their 50s  Old ladies  With the beehive hairdos  Walking around  Serving you drinks  It's so disgusting  I saw a show at the Tropicana  Twattos on ice  I would really bring them in  I think  I think so too  Hey guys  I gotta leave

[02:19:00]  You are the city  The distant ships  From the horizons  You are only coming  Through in waves  Your lips move  But I can't hear  What you're saying  When I was a child 
[02:19:30]  I had a fever  My hands felt just like  Two balloons  Now I've got that feeling  Once again  I can't explain  You will not understand  This is not how I am  This is not how I am  I have become

[02:22:00]  On my own  I turned to know that it was gone  I cannot put my finger on it now  The child is long  The feeling's gone  But I have become comfortably numb 
[02:22:30]  The child is long  I experience the pain  I can't hear what you're saying  Thank you.

Make sure you get your wow on your ride, your truck, what have you, and then you're in  the game, basically.  That's how it works.  It's been happening for many, many, many years.  You get wow in your car, and if the ladies feel like it, they flash as they're riding  alongside you.  If you don't have an official wow sticker, you can go to opiananthony.com to get the address. 
[02:26:00]  Basically, you send in a self-addressed stamped envelope, and we send the wow stickers out  to you.  Okay?  Right.  What's up, Anthony, over there?  I was just reading instant feedback.  I don't think people appreciated the live version.  Of comfortably no?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Why?  I loved it.  Dude, you know what?  Why?  It was great.  I think people just love to just, you know, bitch every single day.  He sounds constipated.  My ears are uncomfortably numb from the vocals. 
[02:26:30]  Yike.  Are we listening to Hit Me Baby one more time?  Thanks, Eric, as I was going to read the rest of that one.  Yeah, Eric.  Put it back.  Oh, no.  We got to find that.  A live version of that is probably not easy to do.  I mean, yeah, the harmonies are a little weird on that one.  Oh, well.  Jesus, time's a bitch.  That was the rest of that instant feedback.  Okay.  Oh, wait.  Good, Anthony.  All right.  Why don't you guys just play Stairway to Heaven and ride it home until 11? 
[02:27:00]  We did pick a long one.  Yes, we did.  We don't get any breaks.  We need them.  That was a seven-minute song.  Why not?  Why not?  A little sluggish after the long Fourth of July weekend.  Mm-hmm.  Charging our old batteries.  You're preaching to the choir.  Charging the old batteries.  I blew it again over the four-day weekend.  I do it every time.  Every time.  I can't get my sleep right.  So I wind up waking up late, and I go to bed later that night. 
[02:27:30]  And by the time I have to get up at five in the morning again, I haven't been to sleep  until after midnight.  You saw me when I showed up today.  Oh, yeah.  I woke up at 5.45.  I was here by 6.05.  Oh, just jumped in your clothes.  Oh, my God.  Ran out.  I was able to rinse off in the shower.  I can't even call it a shower.  No.  A rinse.  A quick rinse off.  It's a rinse.  Threw my skates on because I'm trying to be hip, and I rollerbladed to work.  I was here in 15 minutes from waking up. 
[02:28:00]  Alarm clock out the door, sitting on that couch, staring at Anthony going, what happened?  And me just, uh-huh, what?  But you did well in Atlantic City.  Oh, yes.  You did what you're not supposed to do, but it worked in your favor.  Yeah.  Old, well, uh, you know what happens when you're ready to leave, and it's still a little  early.  Um, I want to get back because I didn't want to rush back on 4th of July and then catch  the boat because we went out on, uh, uh, Billy Mac's River Rose. 
[02:28:30]  The River Rose.  Oh, the gay boat.  For 4th of July.  It's not a gay boat.  He did a couple of, uh, uh, booked a couple of gay cruises.  I guess he does that, but for the 4th of July, it was just people going out and watching  the fireworks.  When you were on the boat, was the floor sticky?  How'd you know it was the gay cruises just circled?  He just circled St. Vincent's.  Just circled the Statue of Liberty and pointed at the Statue of Liberty and said, that's a 
[02:29:00]  woman.  No.  Well, she's gloved, gloved.  That was a boat crash.  You know what it was?  I should have just enjoyed your, your, uh, great line.  It was taking too long to get to.  You were going, well, you're circling it and I saw you going, oh shit.  Well, you kind of threw me off.  I had a really good line and then you killed with that line and then I'm like, why am I  doing this?  In the middle of it, I'm like, why am I even doing this now?  Why?  Comedy is all about timing.  I'm like, I knew as soon as I started, I'm like, why am I doing this? 
[02:29:30]  Why?  Anyway.  Yeah, so I want to get back, uh, I want to get back for that.  I'm going to enjoy that one during the replay.  Oh, listen and savor it.  Anyway, go ahead.  So I want to get back for the, uh, the boat ride, uh, to watch the fireworks.  The gay cruise.  No, it wasn't gay.  It was a, our own Eric was there on the, uh, boat cruise.  Oh, that legitimizes it.  And Big Kev.  That's right.  All right, it's a boat that he has used for gay cruising.  Yeah, he's using it. 
[02:30:00]  We have discussed on this program, but he was doing a legitimate or, well, you probably shouldn't  say legitimate, but it was a, uh, regular cruise.  It was a regular cruise on the 4th of July.  And he's great because he's, uh, you know, he, uh, he's, uh, on the job.  So, uh, he's able to take his boat there.  They got the NYPD boats.  Can I interrupt you for a second, Anthony?  Yeah, sure.  Because you're looking at some feedback and some of this instant feedback just pisses you off.  Steve D. from Nextel 2-way Message.  It was in eight cities, you tools.  That's why it was called Live 8. 
[02:30:30]  Now, it was probably in eight cities.  Probably.  But that's not the reason why it was called Live 8, was it?  And it was six cities.  And if it was eight cities, they would have only put it in eight cities to match the title  of G8.  That's what I'm saying.  It had nothing to do with how many cities it was in.  How many cities was it?  They were playing off the G8 thing.  I'll tell you right now how many cities it was.  One, two, three, four, five, yeah, six cities, according to what I got in front of me.  Six.  Oh, who is that tool? 
[02:31:00]  You really are stupid.  You really are stupid.  They were playing off the whole G8 thing.  Yes.  That I know.  Right.  If it so happened to be in eight cities, which it wasn't, it turns out, then so be it.  Yeah.  All right.  Back to Atlantic City, Anthony.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  So I wanted to get back.  But we were leaving, I guess, Sunday.  Yep.  And we did that thing that you're never supposed to do.  Let's just go down to the casino and play a couple more hands. 
[02:31:30]  Because we were leaving ahead.  Now, we got there Friday after the show.  We left Friday and started doing our gambling, me and my girlfriend.  And I was taking a beating.  She was doing pretty good.  And it went that way for the night.  And the next night, I was doing pretty good.  She wasn't doing so good.  But we wound up eking it out so that when we were ready to leave, we were 700 bucks a head.  And I'm talking, you know, I took out just about four grand to gamble with. 
[02:32:00]  That's what I do now.  I go down there.  I go for a large.  Live 8 was in 10 cities.  So now we're up to 10 cities.  I think it was in 20 cities.  Live 20.  It was in 6 cities.  It wasn't in 10 cities.  People are so stupid.  Why would you just shut up?  Look, Live 8 was in 9 cities.  I'm counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 
[02:32:30]  I'm counting 9.  You only broadcasted 6.  And we only broadcasted 6.  All right.  So 6 minus 9.  Oh, math now?  3.  3.  Whatever.  Dude.  All right.  Go ahead.  Who else?  What other names do they have that are not on this list?  Pac Battle.  No?  It was in Red Square.  In Moscow?  Yeah.  What performers do they have in Red Square, Hawk?  Pet Shop Boys. 
[02:33:00]  Jesus.  And the Red Elvises.  That's the best.  We are the best out of all the cities.  We are the Pet Shop Boys.  The only band I recognize in the Moscow show is the Pet Shop Boys.  That's bad.  Well, Italy's was awful, too.  The only...  Tim McGraw and Faith Hill are the only names I recognize.  Country and Italy.  That's wonderful.  That's great.  All right.  Let's go, Anthony.  Who farted?  Is that Jimmy?  No.  That was awful.  So, yeah.  Went downstairs. 
[02:33:30]  Checked out and everything.  Had to put the bags.  You know, when you go to the lobby and go, could you hold my bags because I don't have  a room anymore?  And I went into the casino just for a couple of hands.  And this is the kiss of death because everyone knows if you're ahead and you play the last  few hands, you're just...  You're losing.  You're losing.  And I was taking a beat.  I was playing three-card poker.  And just getting killed.  Getting cream.  My girlfriend really was winning, like, all the money, trying to win back the money I  was losing at the same time.  And then the tides changed and I won pretty good. 
[02:34:00]  Wound up leaving all nervous with $10,000 in hundreds shoved in my pocket.  Wow.  But the kicker is you were leaving and you were only going to do, what, 15 minutes of  gambling, whatever, half-hour gambling, get your car in and start...  A couple of hands.  And you were there how long?  Six hours.  Six hours.  Six more hours of gambling.  And, yeah.  Left with 10 G's after I had the four that I started with. 
[02:34:30]  So, six...  Made that $6,000.  You just sat there and made a day's pay.  That's nice.  That's it.  Days...  It was...  Yeah.  It never happens.  You know.  I usually leave a little up, a little down.  You know.  Try not to lose too much.  But to leave that far ahead was pretty good.  That's awesome.  Let's say...  Had a couple of fans that sat down, pulled out like 20, 30 bucks, put it on the table,  sat down, lost it immediately, and then shook my hand and was like, eh, huge fan, dude.  Pretty cool. 
[02:35:00]  How are you doing?  They spent money just to shake your hand.  Yeah.  They didn't want to play three-card poker.  Not knowing you have Shirelle under the table and you were cleaning off the dirty germs.  Dirty those chips are?  I know.  People coughing like Colin.  Casino blowing in chips.  Perfect air for Anthony from above.  Yes, please.  He requested if...  Travel with oxygen.  Adam, what's going on?  There's a man sitting there with a space suit on.  He's rich.  Don't...  Just don't acknowledge him.  Adam, welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:35:30]  What's up, Adam?  Good morning.  Ben's hog is so big.  It's in more cities than a live aid.  Oh.  That's not bad.  Not a bad Ben's hog little joke.  Bunch it out, fellas.  All right.  Nice.  Very good.  And then, yeah, the 4th of July thing was great because we took the boat out.  And then we were able to get really close because of his contacts, you know, his contacts.  You got the NYPD boats out there.  And then they had the Coast Guard.  We're talking about the fireworks university for the people around the country.  The Macy's fireworks. 
[02:36:00]  They do it in that river over there.  Is it called the East River or something?  Fireworks day.  Yeah, fireworks display.  Where'd the boat leave from?  West side or your side?  Left from right by LaGuardia.  Yeah.  Right by LaGuardia in Queens.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  And took the boat around, which is amazing because there's so many boats on the water that  you're just getting tossed around like crazy.  Really.  This boat was...  And then all the way back, it's the same thing.  And everyone's drunk and trying to dance.  And they're just getting slammed from one side of the boat to the other.  Very funny to watch.  But we were very close to the fireworks because we were able to get really close to the barges 
[02:36:30]  to the point where like embers were falling down around us.  Yeah.  They had a Coast Guard Zodiac boat keeping people back with .50 caliber machine guns mounted  on it.  A little...  Kind of interesting to see, you know.  Right.  A little sign of the times there.  But I had a great time.  Billy Mack on the River Rose.  So if you want to book a cruise there, look that up.  I guess you go online.  River Rose.  Billy Mack will get you close.  Yes, he can get you close. 
[02:37:00]  It was a blast though.  You know how cool that is being on the water?  And you look at the fireworks going off and then the reflection in the UN looks like...  It almost looks like a TV screen of the fireworks display.  Very cool.  I just stayed home and played Men Without Hats records.  Oh.  How'd that work for you?  Safety dance.  Over and over again.  Safety dance.  Yeah.  The River Rose does have a website.  Is it River Rose?  The River Rose.  The River Rose dot com.  All right. 
[02:37:30]  Were there any single broads on this boat?  I don't know.  I was playing poker the whole time.  I didn't look around.  A couple, I think.  Billy.  Billy Mack, everyone.  Well, hey, Ant.  What about the ten grand you want on the boat playing cards?  Well, it wasn't quite that much.  We were all playing.  You were playing poker on the boat too?  Yeah.  Yeah, I had a bunch of money out there, singles that Billy came up with, and we were just sitting  in the back of the boat playing poker.  Yeah, it was my wife's tips, by the way.  Oh, tips. 
[02:38:00]  Those dollar bills that were stuffing down a bra.  He does a great job, though.  That's a nice boat.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Wait, so you just bought this boat and this is your new thing, Billy?  No, he's had this for five years now.  This is a fifth year out.  We had it back when you guys were on the other station.  We were going to try and do a booze cruise, which I'd like to still try to do.  I say we do that.  With the listeners.  Yeah, but we have to have a booze cruise, but you have to do something stupid to get  on the boat somehow.  We need some kind of angle. 
[02:38:30]  How about an under-21 booze cruise?  There you go.  Teen booze.  Oh, I like that.  Under-20.  Teen booze.  But it's not B-O-O-Z.  It's B-O-O-S, and we just watch Voss videos.  All right, guys.  I've got to go.  Bye.  All right, Billy.  We'll figure that out.  How about this?  We have a cruise, and we charge listeners $1,000 each, but we talk to you while you're  on the boat.  Hey, there you go.  You get to talk to the on-air members of the O.B. and Anthony program.  That sounds like an original idea that no other TV or radio personalities have done. 
[02:39:00]  $1,000 a ticket.  What was that, Bill O'Reilly's bomb?  Was it really?  Bill O'Reilly.  Yeah, I think Bill O'Reilly was charging his own viewers to take a booze cruise with them  or a cruise or whatever.  They had to cancel it for lack of interest.  How much are they charging?  I don't even know, but I'm sure.  Probably $2.50.  Pretty penny.  What a douche.  Six-foot-eight pervert.  Hey, we've got to bring up something on the show that is just unbelievable to me.  Dice has turned us down.  He will not do our program.  Yeah.  He will not do our program. 
[02:39:30]  I guess he's playing, what, Caroline's this weekend?  Yeah.  Thanks.  Dice, and he's been a friend of the show for many years, and for some reason, he has  officially turned us down.  Greg from Caroline's called Ben and said, Dice has turned you guys down.  He will not be doing your program.  Isn't that lovely?  What's up his ass?  I don't know.  I haven't talked to him in over a year.  It was December of 2003, I think, or November.  Last gig we did together, I was touring with him in Florentine, and we were doing the regatta. 
[02:40:00]  And after that, we were supposed to do more gigs in 2004.  Seattle was booked.  So I called him a couple times.  I'm like, and my agent, we had the same personal appearance agent, was being a little awkward  because he was kind of caught in the middle.  So I left him a couple messages.  I'm like, I know we're doing this gig.  I just wanted to get the exact date so I can plan around it.  And I never heard back from Andrew, and then the agent's like, yeah, he just kind of was  like, he kind of indicated that he didn't want me on the show, which was fine.  I mean, maybe it was a money thing.  Whatever it was.  I didn't, whatever. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, maybe it was a money thing.  I mean, who knows?  Or it could have just been he wanted to go another direction, but I kind of was, he  could have called me and told me, but we didn't have any harsh words, but that was the  last, I called twice and never called back.  Maybe it's Jimmy is killing.  I was going to say, Jimmy's being played.  It's Jimmy's blowing up, and Dice doesn't want that as part of his team of comedy.  I got to be honest.  I mean, the shows were very solid all the way through.  It wasn't like he was having trouble after me.  He was killing.  I mean, I would love to think that for my own, you know, personal, as a comedian, but he  was doing great.  I just don't know what the problem was.  Whatever. 
[02:41:00]  It was what it was.  Yeah.  I don't understand.  So he has officially said no to our program, which just amazes me.  It really does.  Because we really, really, honestly, I'm not surprised, but we really, really helped  him out when he really needed us.  And now, we get nothing from him.  He was playing at the Borgata when I was there over the weekend.  I didn't go see him.  You didn't go?  No, fuck that.  All right.  Well, too bad.  That's too bad.  Too bad.  Too bad for him. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  And then another thing really fast.  Just amazing that regular radio is just not believing that the satellite radio is going  to work.  Yeah.  XM just reported their second quarter numbers, and I guess they added 640,000 new subs.  Yeah, in three months.  640,000 new subs in three months.  But there's guys out there in regular radio that they're just convinced that this is just  never going to work.  Yep. 
[02:42:00]  They're delusional.  And what do they say?  It's like two and a half or something people per sub?  Yeah.  You want to go conservative and say that's a million people?  Let's go conservative.  Forget saying it's a million three, a million five.  Say conservatively.  That's a million people in three months.  In three months.  That are telling commercial radio to go fuck itself.  Keep ignoring it, stupid asses.  And we're talking to a nice percentage of that.  A real nice percentage of that.  Yes, Anthony?  I have the Bill O'Reilly thing.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  The Battle for American Values.  A Caribbean cruise featuring special guest Bill O'Reilly. 
[02:42:30]  Host of Fox News, The O'Reilly Factor.  Aboard Holland America's newest vessel, the Westerdam.  And this was November 13th through 20th, it was supposed to be.  Sail with Bill O'Reilly and enjoy two, two private appearances by Bill O'Reilly.  Followed by a question and answer session.  Ah!  Sorry.  Sessions with Admiral Jeremiah Denton, former Vietnam POW.  A symposium with Thomas Law. 
[02:43:00]  What?  Wait, so basically you're on a cruise and he does two appearances?  Yeah.  Is what it is?  Eight days.  They probably fly him in for a quick little thing and then he flies out.  You're right.  He's probably not even on the ship.  You're right.  He might stay the night and, you know, the two appearances are back-to-back or something.  We'll take pictures.  Dude, $1,099.  Good, it shouldn't have went.  Who wanted that?  For the cruise?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, but you get all the nice food and stuff, right?  Yeah.  And then special offer VIP cocktail reception with Bill. 
[02:43:30]  Limited to 100 passengers for an additional $250.  Jesus.  Cocktail reception with Bill O'Reilly.  The arrogance of this ad had to make people not want to do it because his listeners have money.  They didn't.  They stayed away in droves.  It says, sadly, the battle for American values will be hard for Mr. O'Reilly to win if he can't launch a single ship.  Well, that's why the Opie and Anthony Cruz is only $1,000.  Right. 
[02:44:00]  As opposed to $1,300 or $1,400.  And you get, I will personally look you in the eye and shake your hand and pretend I'm interested.  Exactly.  How nice of us.  We're that kind of people.  So, anyway, XM Satellite Radio had just another huge quarter.  Absolutely huge quarter.  Yeah.  And, by the way, I got my new Sky-Fi, Delphi, Sky, whatever the fuck it is.  Yes.  Because mine got stolen.  Yeah.  And I got this rewind feature that I'm just out of my mind. 
[02:44:30]  Wait, are they going to rewind now?  Out of my mind.  It is just amazing.  Well, and I got to tell you, Fred still stinks.  Stinks on ice.  Tell him, Fred.  Can we get this John Zellner, his name John Zellner, on the phone and ask him what he's doing?  Because a lot of the channels are starting to get a lot better, musically.  But that Fred stinks.  Yeah.  I go there all the time.  Not one hit from, you know, the new wave bands in the 80s.  Not one fucking hit.  All obscure. 
[02:45:00]  All obscure shit.  Yeah.  They're catering to a tiny, tiny, tiny piece of the market.  Maybe they're just doing one station at a time.  I could be.  I understand satellite radio.  You're trying to be a little too hip for the room.  A little more niche.  A little, you know, you want a little more variety and stuff.  But how do you have a station that is completely dedicated to new wave music, something that  was huge on Long Island when we were growing up and stuff, and you go to the channel, you  know, day in and day out, and you hear, like, the fifth track from the Blinded by Science 
[02:45:30]  fucking album that Thomas Dolby came out with.  Yeah.  Play Blinded by Science.  Jesus.  That's all I want is a couple fucking hits, and then I go back to Ethel or check out what  we're doing in replay or something.  You hear one song that you're kind of psyched about, and then the next song comes on, and  it's a little more.  Dude, it's one song that you're into, and then maybe ten that you're like, what?  Yeah.  They've got to tweak that.  I was a DJ back then.  You know, college radio and shit.  I, you know, so don't say that I don't know this shit.  I know this stuff. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  It's way too obscure.  But my new unit for the car, it has this rewind feature.  It's amazing.  So let's say you're on Ethel.  It only, I, I don't know everything about, but basically you're, you're, you're ready  for your road trip.  You got the, the XM on.  So starting at that point, it just starts recording.  So you could go back a half hour.  You know what I mean?  So let's say.  It's like a half hour.  It's like a TiVo almost.  Like a TiVo where you're watching live TV, and you can just, it records.  I think it only works on the channel you're on.  So let's say you're on Ethel, and let's say you're, you're driving along, and all 
[02:46:30]  of a sudden your phone rings, and you, you, you do a 20 minute phone call or whatever,  okay?  You're like, oh shit, what was on Ethel?  You could actually rewind at that point and see what you missed.  So then you could pick and choose some songs that you want to hear.  Yeah.  And then while you're listening to those songs, it's still continuing to record, and then  you're like, oh, well, what have they played since I went back to listen to, let's  say, the new Coldplay song?  It's a, it's an amazing feature.  But it starts over after, TiVo will be on live TV.  I think if you turn off the car, done, you lose it.  Yeah, you lose it, but you know, you could go, and if you, I don't know, it's a brand 
[02:47:00]  new U2 song or what have you, and you're like, oh yeah, you know, I like that.  I want to hear that again.  Just go and hear it again.  And while you're hearing that again, it continues recording.  It's great.  And forward.  Just amazing.  That's great.  But is it, you know, the satellite radio is taking off, and it's, it's just exploding,  in my opinion.  And you get these asses out there in commercial radio that are just delusional.  I don't want to see it.  The latest is Man Cow, once again.  Man Cow, who all of a sudden decided that he didn't do the shock jock stuff.  That he was forced to do it, because he's changing his image, because that's the only 
[02:47:30]  way he's going to survive in this environment.  And they're kind of syndicating him to really, really tiny, tiny stations in big markets.  Like, he just picked up L.A., I guess, and he's like ranting and raving, but it's a tiny  like sports AM or something.  A little AM station.  You know how many, you know, FM signals there are in L.A.?  A lot.  That'd be six, seven.  At least.  It's probably like 30 or 40 that people are listening to.  It's ridiculous how many FM's are out there. 
[02:48:00]  So anyway, he was trashing satellite radio recently, and we got a little piece of that.  Sirius and XM, it's not going to work.  It is not a business model that will work.  In the end, what's going to happen is it will be specialized channels on those, on those  carriers, and it'll be things like the RV network or the trucker's network.  What?  The RV network and the trucker's network.  Yeah, because that'll wash.  That'll fly.  Not a good business model.  Another bullshitter.  He's using words like business model. 
[02:48:30]  He must know what he's talking about.  Another bullshitter.  Right now, on my cell phone, I can get tons of entertainment.  Broadband radio, I...  What?  Ringtones?  Yeah, what kind of entertainment can you get on your cell phone, you ass?  I get good entertainment on my cell phone, too.  It's talk to fat chick, jerk off, then hang up while she's in mid-sentence.  Someone explain to me the entertainment you can get on your cell phone.  It's all going the way of the cell phone.  And satellite radio will, I think, will be available.  Be part of that. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, exactly.  But what kind of entertainment are you getting on your cell phone now that is worthwhile?  Some dumb ringtones of some stupid songs that you liked when you were growing up?  Yeah.  What radio shows are you getting?  I suppose you get, like, a little comedy bit here and there.  Who cares?  A movie line?  Wow.  What else are you getting?  Seven bucks a week to get a joke emailed to you?  You can't even take a good fucking picture off the thing yet.  No.  Still.  No, there's two megapixel shit.  Camera phones stink.  Buy it digitally, you chislers.  They're almost figuring out the camera phones.  Dude, they got them. 
[02:49:30]  They got seven megapixels or whatever.  They just refuse to sell them yet until we go buy up all the two, three, four, five ones.  Buy the shitty ones.  But this guy's talking in broad strokes, saying he gets tons of entertainment off his cell phone,  right?  That's just lying.  It's not...  Is it going that way?  Sure.  But it's nowhere near there yet.  Nope.  I can get tons of entertainment.  Broadband radio.  I've held it in my hand where you can get any radio station in America for free.  Why would you pay that kind of money for XM or Sirius?  Broadband radio off the computer.  Yeah.  Have you listened to that shit? 
[02:50:00]  I hate the dishonesty.  It is awful.  They don't have that figured out yet either.  You need an awful long cable for your car.  And you're still listening to commercial radio, which is nothing but commercials, and there's  no freedom.  That's the problem.  I don't care if you can get on the computer.  You want to hear dog shit from Dayton, Ohio on your computer in New York?  Go ahead.  Great.  XM or Sirius. 
[02:50:30]  I was offered half a million dollars more than what I'm making a year and a half ago.  A million more.  A what?  And I looked at it.  A million or half a million, man cow?  That's how you can tell someone's lying when two seconds after they say one thing, they're  saying another.  A million dollars more than what I'm making a year and a half ago.  A million more.  And I looked at it, and I went, God, I'm a guy that appeals to people that are going  to work.  I know for a fact that this guy's lying.  And we had the same agent, and the guy was not offered to go to satellite radio. 
[02:51:00]  There wasn't enough appeal for someone like man cow.  Holy shit, this guy's lying through his teeth.  He wanted to be on satellite radio badly.  Badly.  Oh, my God.  I try not to go down that road often, because we do have the same agent, and, you know,  out of respect for Bob, but this guy wanted satellite radio badly.  He also wanted to be part of Viacom, to the point he wanted Anthony and I to fly into 
[02:51:30]  Chicago to have a huge steak dinner with him, to get to know us.  Yeah.  So then we'd go back to our big bosses, because we did have power at Infinity Broadcasting  before we fucked up, and tell him how great man cow is, and how Infinity should hire this  guy and finally bring him to New York.  Stop.  So we did, you know, we saw the phoniness in it, and we didn't go for the big steak dinner  summit. 
[02:52:00]  You know, and then, you know, immediately, of course, he starts trashing us, and then when  we got fired, he tries to hire, you know, all the guys behind the scenes here, but then  insists that we're just awful for radio.  Yeah.  That appeals to people that are going to work.  I've been free for ten years.  I would have more listeners in Joliet than I would nationwide or worldwide on any of the  satellite providers.  For now.  I didn't want to...  And maybe.  That is a lie, too.  Yeah.  Maybe in Manhattan, but Joliet. 
[02:52:30]  That's a small town outside Chicago, right?  Yeah.  That's such a lie.  The Blues Brothers could hear you there.  You know, if you have a name for yourself nationwide, you would have, you know, more listeners.  We have a big...  We have a huge audience at this point.  A huge audience.  And with XM adding 640,000 subs in one lousy quarter, it's growing every day.  Don't any of the satellite providers.  I just...  I didn't want to do it. 
[02:53:00]  I wouldn't feel comfortable asking people to pay.  No.  And I think they'll eventually take on advertising.  Look at the technology today.  We couldn't do this five years ago.  Well, this is cool.  Here we are on the internet, around the world.  It's free.  But everybody...  It's going to be interesting to see how Howard does on Sirius.  I am...  My...  By the way, we're on the internet, too.  Yeah.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah.  And don't you have to pay for the internet?  Some kind of internet service provider? 
[02:53:30]  Would you have to pay for a computer?  Well, these guys have a...  You know, it all depends on the deal they have, I guess.  But we're on the internet, as well.  Yeah.  Not totally free.  I am...  My plans in life didn't include him.  And we're syndicating.  And we're picking up a lot of stations.  We just picked up L.A.  San Francisco's coming.  Houston is coming.  Kansas City.  New York, it's...  New York?  Really?  Yeah?  When?  Really?  You've been trying to get into New York for how long, Mancow?  Forever.  How long?  Whole career.  And everyone has, like, just turned their back on you because they know you blow when 
[02:54:00]  it comes down to it?  Why don't you talk about your fine ratings in Chicago, your hometown, and how great they  are?  Because you're so great.  You stink on ice.  And I've stunk for a long fucking time.  You can't say satellite's not going to go anywhere.  It's already here.  It's already here.  It's working.  Satellite is succeeding, even with that cash-hemorrhaging anchor across the street.  But...  Serious. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, I mean, the reality is, you know, I mean, we like to have fun with the little  doggy company.  But, you know, the fact that Howard's coming to satellite radio has legitimized this whole  thing.  Us coming to satellite radio has legitimized this whole thing, you know?  Yeah.  And it will be satellite radio against commercial radio.  And we're going to take a big, huge chunk of the listeners of commercial radio.  It's a fact.  You name me one commercial radio show, whether you like this show or not, but you think that  commercial radio is giving you the laughs this show gives you? 
[02:55:00]  I mean, I know it's kind of arrogant because I'm honored to say that, but come on.  What funny commercial radio shows are out there?  They're doing cutesy, unfunny, censored, terrible bits.  With huge commercial breaks.  Well, the entertainment you can get on your cell phone.  I'm corrected.  You can get Family Guy clips on your cell phone.  Oh.  You know, that's fun, but that's, you know, after a while, you're like, oh, yeah.  That's great for you driving to work.  You hold the phone up to your ear the entire time and listen to Family Guy clips.  I stand corrected.  I understand that the whole, you know, the touch, what is it called? 
[02:55:30]  The ringtones.  Ringtones.  I understand that thing is taking off right now.  Yeah.  You know, and you can get your phone to do some stuff, but it's not going to keep your  attention that long.  It's a cute little quick thing, you know.  John in North Carolina.  What's up, John?  You paid for those.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Would you say you're having issues with Fred?  I've been having issues with the Fred channel since we started on XM.  Since I got XM, which is about two and a half years ago now.  I just wondered if you ever checked out Lucy on 54. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, I like Lucy a lot better than Fred.  A lot.  Lucy does a much better job.  They play songs by, you know, they play a bunch of familiar songs.  I'm not looking for, you know, a hit channel where it has to be just all the hits, but it  seems like we're way too far out with some of these channels still.  I would love to go to deep tracks.  It blows.  It absolutely blows.  Dude, I recognize one song every, I don't know, 20 times I go there. 
[02:56:30]  And I was in rock radio playing music for, you know, over 10 years.  Have we brought this up to the people in charge, though?  We've got to be fair.  We should maybe discuss it with them.  They probably like the input.  Well, we've got a guy that knows what he's doing, this John Zellner guy.  But I'm just waiting to see what he does and when it's going to be implemented totally, you know?  Because I still see, like, a lot of stuff that, a lot of channels where you're just flipping through forever, forever, forever, forever.  Deep tracks.  I get it. 
[02:57:00]  You don't have to go that deep to call it deep tracks, though.  Jesus.  All right.  Thank you, John.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  All right.  We should play another song from Live Aid.  Yeah, you've got to take a leak.  And by the way, we have to talk about Danza's show eventually.  Oh, what's going on?  Oh, they fired.  I heard they fired a co-host.  They fired Katrini.  Why?  They picked it up for, we could do it fast here.  They picked the Danza show up for another year. 
[02:57:30]  The ratings are okay.  Uh-huh.  And then fired, like, a bunch of producers and Katrini.  She's on there right now.  Well, this might be, this has got to be a rerun that she's on there because they fired her, like, last week, Thursday or Friday.  Wow.  And he's so pissed off.  He's saying he's so pissed off that she's gone because she's so talented.  He's so pissed off that he'll continue doing the show, though.  He may be gone, too.  They speculate that he may be gone eventually because, uh...  Not eventually.  They're already hinting that, uh, even though they've picked it up for another year, I guess they're not ready for the replacement show yet, which supposedly is going to be Gloria Estefan. 
[02:58:00]  Ugh, that'll be atrocious.  Doing some, uh, take on some Spanish show that's really huge in, I guess, Miami or something.  I don't know.  Today's show, Seatbelts.  But that's the...  Wow.  But that's the rumor that she's coming in to take over for this, uh, abortion of a TV show.  Her music stinks.  Here we...  Ugh.  I like that.  She's unlistenable.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan.  You guys want to hear Green Day doing Queen's We Are the Champions? 
[02:58:30]  That's kind of cool, right?  Okay.  Alright, it's a good tune.  Alright, uh, as we go to break, another, uh, another song from the Live 8 coverage that happened on XM all weekend long.  I guess you go to Channel 200, if you want to hear some of the stuff that you might have missed.  Okay.  Alright, but, uh, there you have it.  As we go to break, Green Day, We Are the Champions. 
[02:59:00]  Get those hands up in the air!  We've got one last song.  This last little sentiment.  Everybody give it up for Live 8!  I've paid my dues  Time after time  I've done my sentence 
[02:59:30]  But committed no crime  And bad mistakes  I've made a few  I've had my dues  I've had my shoes  And kissed my face  And I've won't do  We are the champions 
[03:00:00]  My friends  We'll keep on fighting  To win  To win  We are the champions  We are the champions  We are the champions  Oh, it's time for those that can see 
[03:00:30]  I'm the champions  And we are the champions  Oh, it's time for your dreams  And we're the champions  And we're the champions  I'm sick of my vows  And if I couldn't cause  You drop me fame and fortune  And everything that goes with it  Don't be shy and believe  No better no offense 
[03:01:00]  Long-fledged cruise  Like considering a chance  But all you've erased  And I'm lost  We are the champions  My friends  We'll keep on fighting 
[03:01:30]  Till we end  We are the champions  We are the champions  We are the champions  We are the champions  We are the champions  We are the champions 
[03:02:00]  We are the champions  We are the champions  We are the champions  We are the champions  Dead side, on the side  The three of the champions  Thank you! 
[03:02:30]  Thank you! 
[03:03:00]  One, two, hey-ho!  Hey-ho! 
[03:03:30]  Prepare to be wowed.  What knockers.  Okay, okay, fine. Wow.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  On this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Wow.  Make sure you get your wowed stickers.  Go to opianthony.com for the address.  Send in the self-addressed stamped envelope.  And we'll send out the wowed stickers immediately. 
[03:04:00]  Immediately.  This guy wants to defend Deep Tracks.  Let's go to Brian in Chicago.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good, Brian.  Hey, listen, Don.  Oh, excuse me.  On the Deep Tracks.  Yeah.  I've got to defend that.  That is an awesome station.  I mean, it plays all the stuff that I grew up with.  I'm 50 years old, and you're what?  And you're 30.  So, you know, that's the beauty of XM, that it covers so many areas of music that, I mean, 
[03:04:30]  I listened to, I got to.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  His phone is in.  He doesn't know how to work that newfangled phone of his.  His phone is in Deep Tracks.  It's just comparable.  Oh, there you go.  What would you get on Deep Tracks?  I never listened to Deep Tracks.  He's fans, you know, you know, like, I don't know, it's like Jethro Tull, but it's some  obscure song.  Yeah.  You wouldn't get your bungle in the jungle.  Even Ian Anderson didn't really believe in the song. 
[03:05:00]  It's like that last song on the album, because, you know, the albums had to be a certain length,  so he's like, ah, I'll throw this little B-side thing that I always never really liked,  just throw it on there.  You know, it's kind of the filler stuff from these albums.  I'm sorry.  You know, there's the hits, and then there's that other level of songs that are just cool in  a way, and then there's that third level where it's just all the crap that just fills up  these classic rock albums from the past, and that's where we're at, in my opinion, with  Deep Tracks. 
[03:05:30]  You know, you play the stuff that was really good, but radio just didn't play the, you  know what I mean?  You don't have to go that deep, is what I'm saying.  Is there a station that maybe offers that, and for people that like Deep Tracks, they can  still?  No, there's Top Tracks that just plays, you know, every, you know, the hits.  Yeah, that's the hits, that's the one I listen to.  The songs that you've heard a million times on rock radio, that's not what I'm getting  at.  Then you go to the next level is all I'm saying.  You don't have to go down two levels.  Yeah.  You know, because even these bands didn't believe in a lot of those songs.  They had to fill up these fucking albums back in the day. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, true.  I don't listen to Deep Tracks.  I mean, I heard that they sometimes, they'll play the who?  Why won't he call?  Can we talk to Bruce?  He's still in London, I guess.  Is he?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Frank in New York City.  Frank, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How are you, Frank?  I totally agree with you, man.  I mean, Fred, Lucy, Ethel, Myrtle, all these stupid channels, they play crap you've never  even heard of.  It's frustrating.  The Fred channel really blows my mind, because that was one genre I was sort of into for 
[03:06:30]  a day or two when I was growing up, was that whole new wave thing.  And, you know, they just, it's unbelievable that you can't get more than one or two hits  an hour.  If that, you know, I think I'm being generous by saying that.  Yeah, it is frustrating.  I recently had the opportunity to listen to Sirius for a week.  I had a rental car that had it.  And I'd hate to give the doggy company their due, but they've got one good channel, the,  was it First Wave or something? 
[03:07:00]  That has all the good stuff you want to hear.  That's the only deal.  I'm going to let you do a commercial for Sirius here, sir.  That's right, sir.  I know that already, because I subscribe to it.  You can say that the XM stations don't maybe have exactly what you want, but.  I'm looking for, you know, a lot more hits, a lot more new wave hits with a little variety.  That's all.  Yeah, because the reality is what you're trying to do with satellite radio is give people what  they're not getting on regular radio.  And you're still not really hearing, you know, those 80s channels and stuff. 
[03:07:30]  You might hear the 80s lunch hour or something like that.  But until there's, you know, channels all over America playing new wave hits around the  clock, then that's your market right there for satellite radio.  It's just a channel that'll play a lot of the 80s new wave hits with a little variety.  And it would be a smash.  A smash.  It'd be a smash.  John in Iowa.  What's up, John?  Well, I got to say, you guys got a lot of balls arguing with the boss like that.  But I got to agree with Opie. 
[03:08:00]  I think it's a crock of shit.  And, you know, people are already, they've been trained to listen to certain things, you  know.  And they're throwing all this oddball shit out there now.  And, I mean, I flipped through it.  And, you know, I can't stand listening to half that crap on there.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Well, you know, but for the most part, people love it.  Huh?  But there are people that just get frustrated sometimes.  It's just my opinion. 
[03:08:30]  Don't get scared, eh?  You know, we'll still have our jobs.  Oh, please.  I personally, you know, very disappointed in the Deep Tracks, the Fred, and, you know.  I love the Boneyard.  And other channels.  I'll stop right there.  Phenomenal.  Boneyard.  Yeah, I like the Boneyards.  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  Ethel's gotten a lot better.  That's the channel I hang with the most.  A lot better.  I go to Top Tracks for a quick hit.  Yeah.  Get the hits there.  I got to say, for the type of music I like, the Boneyard is the best station I've ever heard. 
[03:09:00]  I mean that.  Phenomenal.  Just Phenomenal.  Kiss.  Sav.  Everything I want, they got.  It's the Jimmy Channel.  But even the stuff that I don't like, I still like.  I've heard it before.  It's like, all right, I remember that song.  And, you know.  Yeah, it's not shit that's going way over your head.  It's not faggoty commercial radio.  Classic Rock, the same dog shit.  All right, let's go to Dave.  We get it.  Dave in Missouri.  Clapton again.  Layla.  I know.  I know.  Go ahead, Dave.  He's ruined Layla for me, by the way.  It stinks.  How can you like it?  Anytime it comes on now, I just go, uh. 
[03:09:30]  Layla.  I sing like Jimmy sings when the songs come on.  Jimmy wrecks it for everybody.  When the who comes on, I do that.  Who?  Who?  I do.  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Tell them, Fred.  Tell them, Fred.  Go ahead, Dave.  Hey, I have to disagree a little bit with what Jimmy's saying.  I like the Boneyard myself, but I appreciate Suicide Pollution.  You'll never hear that on any commercial radio.  But they get into, like, so much of the Bonehenge-type Euro metal. 
[03:10:00]  I mean, the off-the-wall shit that nobody listened to in the 80s.  And there was a reason for that.  Okay.  And they demonstrate why.  But, I mean, it's great other than that, but I have to agree with you, L.P.  Like you saw, some of these channels, they really, you know, real quick.  I think they're catering to such a tiny niche.  That's what's so frustrating, you know, and try to be too cool for the room.  You don't need to go that far with it, especially yet, you know.  Until there's a Boneyard-type station all over in every city in America, you don't really have to be that obscure. 
[03:10:30]  People definitely want to hear, you know, the hits.  Right.  Can I say that?  Well, a lot more hits.  Yeah.  Almost every time recently, I've put on the 50s, 60s, or 70s, or 80s channels.  It's almost every time that's been a song I recognized, whereas before it was not.  Yeah, I've noticed that lately.  I've flipped through the decades.  I ignored the 40s.  Well, a lot of people say, well, you know, if you're looking for hits, go to the 80s channel.  But the problem is, the 80s channel, the music genre of the 80s is ridiculous.  It's everything from new wave to faggy dance shit, and, you know. 
[03:11:00]  I don't want to sit through a Lionel Richie 80s song to maybe get to some, I don't know.  Hello, is it me you're looking for?  Say You Say Me is a good song.  A little haunting.  A bit.  Say it for always.  What's the video with him with his big clay head and the blind girl?  That's the way it will be.  Remember that one?  It didn't look anything like him.  I don't remember that.  Except for the huge jaw.  That was awful. 
[03:11:30]  I never cared for dancing on the ceiling.  This is a nice number.  They get this from the old iPod.  Oh.  You want to iPod this song?  Of course I will.  I have eternal flame.  There's some gems.  Fuck, I'll hit the post.  You did.  Save me.  Say it for always.  All right.  Dancing with your new bride.  In all fairness, let's go to Iowa.  Say hi to Jerry.  He wants to defend deep tracks.  Go ahead, Jerry. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, I'd like to defend.  I mean, I'm 53 years old, and when I grew up, we'd throw on a whole album, roll up a dupe,  and listen to the whole thing.  Now, on deep tracks, when they play it, you may not remember just off the top of your head,  but it brings back a lot of memories.  But I'm with Jimmy also.  If I don't like something on deep tracks, I'll go right over to the boneyard.  Right, okay.  I just want a sample hour of deep tracks, because it would be very interesting.  That's just a playlist, though.  That's not fair.  I want an actual hour of deep tracks, if someone could get that to me, just to prove my point. 
[03:12:30]  You know the band, but you've never heard the song in your life.  It's not even, like, in the ballpark, is what I'm saying.  It is way in the parking lot, man.  It's some dude tailgating in the back of the parking lot, listening to some obscure Jethro Tull album,  thinking everyone else is going to enjoy it around them.  Yeah.  We can't find that, though?  No?  I actually was on a contest one time where popular music was the category. 
[03:13:00]  Really?  Yes, I did very well.  And what tripped you up?  Swanee River.  Swanee River.  Ed Norton.  We could go around in circles with this, but there you go.  Where are you going, man?  We're trying to talk to you.  One guy's like, well, I want to defend Fred.  And then another guy's like, well, I agree with you on Fred.  Yeah, I know.  See?  Just a quick opinion, you know?  People are going to like it.  People are going to hate it.  Some guys like the obscure stuff.  Those are some of the songs they play.  This is deep tracks.  Yeah, like Bruce Springsteen. 
[03:13:30]  They play Black Cowboys.  What?  Right?  What is that?  Never heard of it.  I never heard that one, Hawk.  Thin Lizzy.  They play the Cowboys song.  What?  I've heard that.  You've heard?  I think.  The Doors, Land Ho.  Probably the worst Doors song ever.  I'm the hugest Doors fan.  There are so many songs you can play by the Doors that regular radio doesn't play.  I hate hearing any Doors song.  How about Light My Fire? 
[03:14:00]  Leonard Skinner, Crossroads Live.  Am I Losing?  That's a great deep track song.  Am I Losing by Leonard Skinner.  It's a great song that you never heard on radio.  The Doobie Brothers, Living on the Fault Line.  Oh, my God.  Pink Floyd, Summer.  I've heard that one.  Oh, my God.  How about Sabbath?  I'll tell you how deep it is if you get to Sabbath, because I'm pretty familiar with this stuff.  Stray Cats, Mystery Train Kept a-Rollin'.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  It's worse than I thought.  The Rolling Stones, Don't Stop.  Which one are you pointing at?  The Fabulous Rhinestone.  Warned Zevon, Nighttime in the Switching, what was the name of that song?  Switching Yard or something like that, I don't remember.  Keep going down.  I'm trying to find some Sabbath for Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  There's no way to look at you, just under B?  There's no way to do alphabetical?  Like, I love the dead.  We don't talk about it often.  I grew up like I was a mini deadhead. 
[03:15:00]  Big boss man.  Never heard of the song in my life.  Sorry.  I'm sure it's an 18-month-old chant.  Oh, I know.  Now the deadheads are like, oh, God, you're embarrassing all of us.  I understand, but out of all the Grateful Dead songs, big boss man.  How about Casey Jones?  Girls with hairy armpits and dirty feet, dancing in skirts.  I like that.  A little sweaty, maybe you put your nose in there.  That stupid dead dance.  You want to know how gross I am?  I don't shower in the morning, and I woke up, and I took a leak before, like in the studio here,  and I still had toilet paper on my helmet from last night's load. 
[03:15:30]  Forgive me for saying that so filthily, but I just thought it was dirty.  I'm a huge Neil Young fan.  I've never heard of the song Walk On in my life.  How about Old Man?  You don't hear that on the radio?  That's a deep track.  Take a look at my life.  I'm a...  Right.  A lot like you were.  All right.  That's...  All right.  Well, that is a sample.  How about Heart of Gold?  Ah.  And then there's bands I've never even heard of before, and I was spinning rock records 
[03:16:00]  for years.  Wait.  What?  What's the...  Who the...  Oh, you changed it on me?  That's another one.  Another list?  Another deep track.  Elton John, Amarina.  What?  Yeah, here we go.  Jethro Tull, because they love their Jethro Tull.  Roots to Branches.  Never heard of it, sir.  You know, in all fairness, Rolling Stones, Midnight Ramblin' Live. 
[03:16:30]  That would be cool to listen to.  Pink Floyd, Free Four.  Name what album Free Four is on.  Dude, I spun...  Oh, that one?  That's off of...  I spun Floyd Records for...  Off and on for 20 years, probably.  I couldn't even tell you what album that was on.  It was on Dark Side of the Moon.  Was it?  No, it wasn't.  I know that much.  Eagles.  We all know the Eagles, right?  Yeah.  Too many hands.  But that's... 
[03:17:00]  Isn't that what this is supposed to be?  Yeah, but what I'm...  The point is, I'm trying to make, is like...  You could probably think of a bunch of Eagles songs that they just don't play on radio,  that you could consider deep tracks, but that you would enjoy, that you sort of know.  So you want not-so-deep tracks?  That's what I'm saying.  There's like three levels.  There's the hits off the album, and there's stuff that almost made it that is definitely  cool, and then there's that third level.  This is like 20,000 leagues below the tracks.  But the third level is all these songs that were kind of just filler shit.  It really was just filler shit.  If you asked the artist, they'd probably be embarrassed. 
[03:17:30]  Like, why the fuck are you playing Free Four from our band?  Yeah, that's what they'd say.  Hell yeah, they would.  Thank you for playing anything.  Hell yeah, they would.  Alice Cooper, eh?  You know a lot of Alice Cooper.  Have you ever heard of the song, From the Inside?  No.  I only know a couple of the songs.  You know what I was really surprised of?  There's a band called Joy of Cooking?  I don't know many Kiss songs.  I only know their really big, big hits.  And there didn't seem to be that many of them.  Well, rock and roll all night.  I mean, Detroit, Rock City.  But they didn't have any real commercial.  Like, when I went to see Kiss Live years ago. 
[03:18:00]  Remember when they came around?  Yeah, yeah.  I was standing there watching going, oh, I know this one.  And then there was like five songs.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  You didn't know Love Gun?  What?  No, I knew that, too.  Cold Gin?  No, not really.  That's a big one, no.  Maybe you want a hardcover.  Because they're big hits.  I wasn't.  I really wasn't.  There was like two schools back in the day.  The Kiss fans.  And then like, I was more, yeah, Zeppelin.  But I was kind of like Leonard Skinner, Molly Hatchet, Charlie Daniels. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  All that crap.  All right, here we go.  Pink Floyd, another song they love to play is A Great Day for Freedom.  Anyone?  Look at this guy.  Come on, Ant, fess up.  What do you listen to that's so much cooler than all our tastes?  Was I saying anything?  Yes.  What did I say?  I don't know.  I don't listen to cool stuff.  I never said I did.  Wow. 
[03:19:00]  The rhinoceroses.  The rhinoceroses.  There's a band called The Rhinoceroses.  It's bad enough that there's a band called The Rhinoceroses.  And they have a song they play called Apricot Brandy.  I like to be turned on to new stuff, but.  Sean from Jersey.  You've got to keep my attention with some other things in there.  Is there not one Ozzy or Sabbath song on the station?  I'm sure there is.  We're just randomly going through some of the songs they play.  Sean from Jersey saying time to add a new channel.  Call it Greg, and it'll be dedicated to shallow tracks. 
[03:19:30]  That's good.  Just damp tracks, you could call it.  All right, one more before we move on here.  They love their Jethro Tull.  Boree.  I've never heard of it.  It's probably boring, misspelled.  Boree.  I grew up with Cheap Trick.  Kind of liked that band in school.  You did.  In school.  Where did they live?  In the attic with your sister, Randolph?  Don't Be Cruel.  I guess that's the cover of Don't Be Cruel. 
[03:20:00]  Ah.  Ah, way to go, Ulb.  And I'm really trying to be fair here.  Gordon Lightfoot.  All right, Sundown.  We know that song, right?  Oh, yeah.  Now I'm trying to find...  Sundown.  Wait, wait.  What's that CCR song?  Go up.  CCR.  Keep on Chugglin'.  What?  Chugglin'.  Keep on Chugglin'.  John Fogerty wouldn't know that song.  Yeah.  Uh, that's what I'm getting at. 
[03:20:30]  Uh.  How about something a little obscure?  All right.  Take me to...  Proud Mary.  I see a bad moon on the...  What is it?  I see a bad moon arising.  That's it.  I like singing like...  I see trouble on the way.  I see...  Unless, of course, you're Tina Turner.  Then it's Proud Mary.  Beat her abouts the body with a phone book.  Don't mess up the face.  The greatest was after she records a great song, River Deep Mountain High, which is one 
[03:21:00]  of her best songs.  Phenomenal.  With Phil Spector.  And Ike heard it.  And in that moment, just realized that he knew she didn't need him anymore.  And he's like, damn, Anna Mae, that song's good.  And you just know she's about to get a savage ass whipping.  And he does.  He beats her and rapes her on a console in the home studio.  Wow.  Oh, was he piping hot, man?  That song was too good.  Oh, was it good?  Ba-bomp, ba-bomp, ba-bomp, ba-bomp, ba-bomp.  Just had to beat the shit out of her.  Every beat, his fucking fist just clenched.  Give her a good savaging. 
[03:21:30]  There you go.  When I was a little girl, I had a drag car.  Only don't have ever lost.  Who remade this?  Sat?  I think Celine Dion remade this.  Oh, really?  Why don't we end this dumb segment with this phone call from Todd in Virginia.  Go ahead, Todd.  Yeah.  The Fred gets hit. 
[03:22:00]  Don't make a maniac out of me.  The Fred gets hit.  It's a fucking maniac, by the way, sir.  Oh, yeah.  He was the first one to try the new line.  I know.  Try the new line.  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest track.  That's my opinion.  I drove a lot over the 4th of July weekend, and I just wanted to hear a few more hits.  That's all.  Of course.  Not a lot of hits.  Just a few more on some of those obscure channels.  All right.  What?  That's a Fred list. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, Fred list.  Don't even get me started with the Fred list.  It's not one Ozzy or Sabbath song.  Someone says there's a station called Ben's Hog, and it just plays the big hits.  Very funny, Matt.  Replays Yellow Submarine over and over.  Like they have, you know, Fred, Jim Carroll.  Name one Jim Carroll song.  It's a song that regular radio doesn't play, so just stop there and play the song.  All the people who died died.  Thank you.  Just play that instead of It's Too Late. 
[03:23:00]  That's the Fred channel for you.  What I hate about The Boneyard, though, is sometimes I want to hear some Ann Murray,  and I've repeatedly sent in requests, and they'll never play it.  A little Ann Murray?  You Needed Me.  All right.  Oh.  What's wrong with that?  She's sitting in front of a fireplace.  That you know an Ann Murray song.  There's something wrong with that.  Who doesn't?  I couldn't tell you one song.  Fucking Ann Murray rules.  Get it through your head.  Is this on your iPod? 
[03:23:30]  It will be soon.  That's great.  I've got to get a couple of Charlie Rich songs, too.  His iPod has the battery display, where the battery goes down as he uses it, and a T-cell  display, which does the same thing.  Oh, this song?  It's a lovely number.  That's right.  It's like a school teacher singing.  Yes.  This woman.  Wearing a sweater looking like Jason Voorhees' mother.  I actually saw her in the parking garage down at where we parked.  Ann Murray?  Yeah.  No.  Carole King. 
[03:24:00]  No, I remember Ann Murray down there, too.  All right.  I've seen Carole King down there.  Is Ann Murray still alive?  Is that possible?  I think so.  You saw Carole King?  Yeah.  No one even knew.  I love when someone's just uber famous.  Like, she was as big as they came in the 70s.  One of the biggest albums ever.  Yeah.  And there, she's just sitting there waiting to get her car like anyone else.  I love that.  I remember the first time I heard of her, Carole King or whatever, was my teacher, Mrs. Vivaldo.  That was my teacher's name.  Ugh.  I was a big Carole King fan. 
[03:24:30]  Vivaldo.  Vivaldo.  Great name.  All right.  Enough.  How about some Charlie Rich, maybe?  How about a break?  But, Opie, I like Charlie Rich.  The most beautiful girl in the world.  Or, uh, what's the other one that was a big hit by him?  I'm out of my league when it comes to Charlie Rich.  Charlie Rich.  I have no idea.  She's always, oh, shit. 
[03:25:00]  Way out of my league.  Did you happen to see the beautiful girl in the world?  Oh, this was Charlie?  Wait, he says his, he goes, k.  Wait, uh, k.  He makes his K sound.  Not this song, though.  The other one.  Was she crying?  Crying.  What's the other big Charlie Rich song for someone?  Pete's sake, help me out here.  If you happen to see the beautiful girl in the world.  I think he did a song called Who Cares?  No, but he's, he was a big, he was a big, uh, performer, but he, tell her I'm sorry. 
[03:25:30]  There he goes.  What?  Look, you, you, uh, you turned me on to Johnny Cash, I gotta be honest with you.  He says, k.  But you're not gonna turn me on to Charlie Rich.  Wait, you gotta hear the other one.  Wait.  Oh.  No, not this song, the other song.  Which one?  I'm so fucking annoyed.  But he says his, see, he's like, sounds like, uh, like, uh, Hyman Roth.  Hyman Roth.  Pick.  Let's go to Russ in New Jersey.  Go ahead, Russ.  Hey, that Keep On Chuglin by Credence.  Yeah. 
[03:26:00]  Excellent song.  Oh, yeah?  Excellent song, yeah.  Can we play?  That's it.  All right.  Can we play Keep On Chuglin?  I've never heard of it.  Behind Closed Doors.  Ah.  Wait, where are we going now?  Behind Closed Doors by Charlie Rich.  Because he says his, he's like, oh, she loves to talk.  It's very.  And you notice these little things.  Hyman Roth.  I'm obsessed with Hyman.  It's Hyman Roth.  Hyman Roth.  That man was Mo Green.  Talk.  You can really hear it on one of these. 
[03:26:30]  Talk.  Talk.  My baby makes me proud.  Oh, don't you make me proud.  Oh, you said make.  Yeah, you'll hear it.  Look at this little click.  Not yet, though.  She never makes a scene.  By hanging all over me.  In a crowd.  Here it comes.  Those people like to talk.  Oh, don't they love to talk. 
[03:27:00]  That's great when you notice.  That's amazing.  When they turn out the lights.  I know she'll be leaving with me.  Everybody.  And when we get behind closed doors.  When she lets her hair hang down.  Or when it falls out because she has cancer.  Oh.  All right. 
[03:27:30]  Makes me glad that I'm a man.  Holy crap.  Oh, how Ben has a big cock.  Ma, please stop calling me.  Can you play that Chuggin' song by Keep On Chugglin'?  Chugglin' is the title anthem.  Keep On Chugglin'.  Is it Chugglin' or Chuggin'?  It's with an L.  Chugglin'.  Wow. 
[03:28:00]  Deep Tracks.  I see a bad moon arising.  I see trouble on the way.  Look, it's like, love to talk.  Talk.  Keep on chuglin'.  Keep on chuglin'.  It's good, though.  Keep on chuglin'.  Chuglin'.  Chuglin'.  I don't know this. 
[03:28:30]  I like it, though.  I'd probably sit through this.  Sounds like Born on the Bayou.  Yeah.  It sounds like every hit they have.  This is the hit that was done a little too sideways, so.  Just make it to a hit, though.  In all fairness, I personally would sit through this, bro.  Oh, great.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Here come Lord, works in the solo.  He gon' chuglin' night.  Keep on chuglin'. 
[03:29:00]  All right, we get it.  He's chuglin' along.  Did you get that instant feedback?  Seven more minutes.  Play Keep on Chuglin'.  It was from johnf at yahoo.com.  John Fogarty, of course.  I got it.  Couldn't help that I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Did not help.  Oh, no, I suck.  Let's go to David.  Go ahead, David.  Hey, is that me?  Yeah, go ahead, David.  Yeah, with you guys talking about trying to change these guys' channels, that's one of 
[03:29:30]  the things I like about satellite radio, is I've heard some music that I have never  heard before, and I find it rather refreshing.  Yeah, I think we're a little too critical here.  Look, I'm just giving my opinion.  You know, I'm not saying that XM should change their whole freaking, you know, service.  Yeah, it doesn't change the whole thing, but you keep talking about changing deep tracks.  Oh, yeah.  Just go find what you want.  And then when it sucks, you go somewhere else. 
[03:30:00]  And then when it really sucks, you go back to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony again.  Opie has a very good point, though, because he's like, he's complaining that deep tracks  doesn't play enough hits.  Yeah.  I didn't say it.  I know.  I went with my analogy that you only have to go down two levels instead of three.  The classic rock stations never play enough new stuff.  All right.  First time I've been on the radio.  Thanks for letting me on.  And hopefully the last.  All right.  You were stellar.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's up?  Yeah.  What's wrong with Music Lab? 
[03:30:30]  What is Music Lab?  You guys sample a lot more of this XM than I ever have.  Dude, I spin.  Sometimes I just spin around.  I start from the channel one and go all the way through.  Yeah.  All the way through.  I'll even get to, I think it's called Folk Village.  Folk Village.  Is it called Folk Village?  No one?  What the hell is that?  No, it's The Folk Village with Joaquin Phoenix.  And then the blue, sometimes I land on the Bluegrass Junction where they're all just 
[03:31:00]  fiddling away all afternoon long.  They're just fiddling and fiddling.  Every song sounds exactly the same.  I could ever end up there.  I don't like Bluegrass.  I almost crashed my car trying to find Fox News Channel.  I would love to talk to someone from the Bluegrass Junction channel and have them explain what  makes a good fiddle song and what makes a bad fiddle song because it all sounds the same  to me.  You know what I have?  I have a few presets that I can remember.  One whole block of presets is Top Tracks, Ethel, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and then New York 
[03:31:30]  Traffic.  How about 202?  I don't have that programmed in my vehicle.  I have to listen to this shit on the way home.  All right, Brian, let's go.  It's on my second set of presets.  They claim, you know, they play all these jam songs like Phish and all this great stuff,  but they end up playing mostly progressive rock music like Genesis.  And who the hell is listening to Genesis?  Well, I enjoy a nice Genesis song every once in a while. 
[03:32:00]  Sure.  Yeah, but not every third song.  In case someone's sculling with an accent.  Not every third song, though.  I mean, Opie, I know you love your jam bands, and, you know, there are comparable stations  out there that really love to jam on, but as a music lab, I mean, I work in a laboratory  myself, so I want it to be good.  What, are you a scientist or something?  What's that?  You work in a laboratory?  Yeah, I work in a lab. 
[03:32:30]  You're a big Bunsen burner user, are you?  I'll do petri dishes and whatnot.  Thank you, sir.  You got it, buddy.  Take it easy.  Woo!  You end up here?  What kind of music do you enjoy when you kidnap a nine-year-old in Idaho?  God.  That's the music you play when you also say, I'd like to have a Shasta.  Soda.  Okay. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  Perfect.  Yeah.  Wow.  I like this.  White people music.  Yeah, this plays in the background of...  Say your prayers, little one.  Don't forget my son.  You're not going to hear this.  Tuck you in warm within, keep you free from sin, till the same man he comes.  This is when they sold out.  Sleep with one eye open.  I like their hillbilly stuff. 
[03:33:30]  Ripping your pillow tight.  Exit light.  Enter white.  Take my hand.  Off to never, never land.  Yee-haw.  There you got a little sample.  That's weird that they put that bluegrass with heavy metal.  It's almost like some kind of conglomerated, mulatto, mongrel class of music. 
[03:34:00]  Both genres will be destroyed.  And ask them if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is, they want to throw white children and colored children into the building part of integration.  Through out of which will come a conglomerated, mulatto, mongrel class of people. 
[03:34:30]  Both races will be destroyed in such a moment.  I, for one, after God will die before I'll yield one inch.  And that kind of conglomerated, what about that?  Applause all around.  I like when he says onslaught.  Onslaught.  Yeah, onslaught.  All right, well.  Fiery little fella.  Hey, what's going on with the cover band competition?  Ooh.  We don't want to pick official winners.  Like, someone is really confused about what we want to do with this cover band thing. 
[03:35:00]  Like it's a real competition?  Well, eventually, eventually it's going to, we're going to, we're going to, eventually we're going to pick the best cover band, you know, band or whatever that comes in.  But I guess we're going to pick a few bands to do an appearance with us.  Is that what's going on?  We're going to be doing an appearance very soon in New York City and we're going to have a few cover bands perform.  What's wrong, Steve?  No, I was going to, I was going to talk about the band sending stuff in, but Ben knows about the live thing.  Ben?  Oh, no, well, that's not set in stone.  No, it's good enough that we know we're going to do something soon in New York City and we're going to get some cover bands to play for us. 
[03:35:30]  Right, I've been talking, I've been emailing back and forth to a lot of bands.  They're supposed to be sending stuff in, but they are slow to the post office.  Because a lot of them are on the West Coast.  Glamouring.  Slow to the post office.  I just, because these guys, you ask them, but they don't send in stuff.  So you try to get them to email MP3s, those don't show up.  Try to get them to mail and stuff, and then maybe a VHS tape shows up a week later, so it's just, I'm happy.  Isn't it easy to just send it online?  Uh, well, I think so, but they don't apparently.  Don't you want them to send it to the Opie and Anthony HQ? 
[03:36:00]  HQ.  Who came up with that?  Uh, that was, that was me on the flip.  Does anyone use snail mail anymore?  I love that term.  So, you guys want the cover bands to send in their stuff by tomorrow?  Is that what, what's going on?  Tomorrow.  It says July 7th.  Tomorrow?  Send material in by July 7th, which would be maybe Thursday, Friday maybe?  I think we might want to extend that a couple days.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we're trying to get Brother Joe's band to play. 
[03:36:30]  If his band can't play, we shouldn't do it, because his is the best band.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, when he plays, uh, I just expect Bruce Kelly to start just weeping.  Just weeping.  He sounds like.  It was wonderful.  I thought Bono was on stage.  All right, we're going to get out of here early.  I'm like a 14-year-old kid.  How much time we got before you play the Who song?  Blubbering mess.  Any time?  Go ahead.  All right, we, yeah, we got to get out of here.  This is just.  Why?  We're not dragging.  I just got to sleep.  I got to sleep.  This just.  I wrecked myself, man.  Wrecked myself over the weekend. 
[03:37:00]  All right, uh, we don't have to plug anything.  Here's from, uh.  I have something to plug.  All right.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  No, I don't care.  Play it over the intro.  Go ahead.  Play the intro.  No, we ain't talking over the music.  I want to hit the post.  We don't talk over the music here.  All right.  We don't talk over the music.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  We don't talk over the music.  Get your plug in.  Cleveland gets Norton.  July 23rd.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me. 
[03:37:30]  That first show was sold out.  And, uh.  Cleveland gets a second show at the Odeon July 23rd.  Ticketmaster.com.  And my brother is, uh, doing a quick order for Opie and Anthony Pest shirts.  Pest shirts.  Unlimited edition shirt kind of thing.  So, uh, you can pre-order for the next week or two.  You can email him at doctor, spell out doctor, drduck, D-U-K, at AOL.com.  I guess that info's up on Opie and Anthony.com?  Yes, it is.  Get your Opie and Anthony, uh, Pest shirts.  Okay? 
[03:38:00]  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  We leave you from the, uh, Live 8 thing.  Go to Channel 200, I think, uh, to hear what you missed over the weekend.  Really?  We have a little taste here.  The Who, when they were doing it in London, won't get fooled again.  Check it out.  We'll see you next time. 
[03:38:30]  We'll see you next time. 
[03:39:00]  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time. 
[03:39:30]  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time. 
[03:40:00]  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  The change you have to come  And here we are  With the liberty and all the blood that's on  The world looks just the same  And here's the reading change  Of the fantasy unknown 
[03:40:30]  In our land of shore  I'll skip my head to the new constitution  Make a vow for a new revolution  Try to breathe the change all around  Ring up my guitar and play  Just like yesterday  And I'll get on my knees and I'll take  We don't get fooled 
[03:41:00]  We got it  Now I'm coming through the door  I'm coming up for you  Then I'll get on my knees and I'll take  And I'll get on my knees and I'll take  And then I'll take  I'll hear you, Lord, say, I'll get my baby aside 
[03:41:30]  If we have them to be like my other life  I'll hear all my fingers and I'll smile at the sky  I'll know that they're in the time, feel my life  I'll hear you 
[03:42:00]  I'll hear you 
[03:42:30]  I'll hear you 
[03:43:00]  I'll hear you </pre>
