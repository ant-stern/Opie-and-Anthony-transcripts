<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts' typical vulgar and sexually suggestive banter, immediately transitioning into a discussion about listener-created parody songs mocking EROC, a member of the show's production staff.  The hosts debate the comedic value of the songs, analyzing the listeners' motivations, including the potential for social media clout.  This segues into a discussion about their children's school renaming "Leadership Day" to "Hosting Day" due to a parental complaint, sparking a frustrated rant about perceived political correctness in modern parenting and schools.  The conversation bounces between various tangents, referencing figures like Betty White, Louis C.K., Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, James Franco, and Brock Lesnar, and delving into a discussion on the increasing prevalence of severe childhood allergies, contrasting it with their own childhood experiences.  A listener's EROC parody song is played, eliciting a mostly negative reaction from EROC,  followed by a brief mention of Scott and Todd's parody songs. The segment concludes with a mention of Johnny Cash's death anniversary and the playing of one of his songs; the entire segment is heavily punctuated with profanity and sexually explicit comments.

The show then shifts to a discussion of sugary cereals and unhealthy eating habits, followed by a disturbing anecdote about a childhood experience with a chocolate appetite suppressant called "AIDS."  This leads to a conversation about protein bars, soda preferences (with a strong dislike for Diet Pepsi), and customer service horror stories.  The hosts play a portion of a YouTube video titled "Customer Service Meltdown," debating its authenticity and noting the unusual beeping sounds. This segment also features listener calls interjected with audio clips of other purportedly real customer service meltdowns, one of which is a particularly angry man complaining about a broken elevator. The discussion then shifts to the 9/11 anniversary commemorations and criticism of the use of flute music during the reading of victims' names, followed by a discussion of government budget cuts impacting FBI agents and funding allocated to Egypt.  The segment concludes with a Metallica ticket giveaway contest, featuring several callers attempting to identify Metallica songs played by Roland with poorly recited lyrics.  The contest is fraught with technical difficulties and comedic failures to identify the songs.


The Metallica ticket contest continues, dominated by technical issues, frustrated callers, and vulgar jokes from the hosts. Jim Norton is present in the studio throughout this segment.  Jim Jefferies calls in, discussing his shows with Dave Chappelle, the challenges of fatherhood (including graphic descriptions of infant bowel movements and diaper changes), and his upcoming Carnegie Hall performance.  The segment also mentions Kevin Pollak filming a documentary nearby on comedians and misery.  After several failed attempts, the hosts finally select winners, "Rob" (identifying "Trapped Under Ice") and another caller later on.


A new segment begins with a discussion of a woman exhibiting erratic behavior, possibly suffering from undiagnosed mental illness, followed by anecdotes about early career setbacks, including negative experiences with an acting manager and a college professor.  The hosts then transition to a conversation with Denny Falcone, a SiriusXM DJ ("Hard Drive of Hits"), who is in the studio.  They discuss Falcone's DJ style, his parties, interactions with celebrities (including an anecdote about Joe Pesci), and his extensive music collection.  Jim Norton's dislike of Falcone is playfully mocked.  The second half features Jim Norton's advice segment.  He fields calls from several listeners, including David (struggling with drug addiction), Ben (whose girlfriend is secretly texting her ex), and Chris (admitting to racist feelings triggered by interracial couples, particularly in porn). Norton provides advice, often laced with humor and bluntness. The segment concludes with an advertisement for Adam & Eve.


The final segment features more of Jim Nortonâ€™s advice segment.  He advises callers dealing with various relationship issues, including an abusive relationship, infidelity, the aftermath of cheating, and pornography addiction.  The show briefly touches upon a DJ, Mr. C, who resigned after an arrest related to soliciting sex.  A stand-up comedian seeks advice on balancing work and his comedy career, and a firefighter seeks advice on his wife's desire for a three-way. Norton offers advice in each case. The segment concludes with an advertisement for Adam & Eve.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fleshly.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten egg from Sirius.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the crowd.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony.  The Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Tie these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, hearty horns should go off.  Surprise!  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes.  Good morning, everyone.  Here we go. 
[00:02:00]  Ready for broadcast.  Very Lysol-y today.  I like that.  I guess the microphone.  I guess that's better than getting a redesign of the studio.  Yeah, a little Lysol, redesign, whatever.  Where's the keyboard today?  Six of one, half dozen of the other.  The keyboard is shoving the corner.  Fine.  It is fine, as long as it's not over there.  Right. 
[00:02:30]  Greetings and salutations, everybody.  Breaking news, they upgraded our computers a little bit.  What do you mean?  I don't know, Mars was all excited.  Uh-oh.  Look, the phone screen looks a little different.  Hey, it does.  Yay.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I guess they're finally putting some money back into this joint.  Will it help with better callers?  I sure hope so.  I doubt it, but... 
[00:03:00]  Screen down callers with an extra chromosome.  No phones will ring.  No calls, yes, of course.  They're all retarded.  Yes.  Well, that's good.  Is that a new EROC monitor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is, huh?  Just tilt it this way just a tad, if we could, at some juncture.  Because I like seeing EROC, too.  Yeah?  It's like a little display.  It's very slimming, EROC.  Oh, is it? 
[00:03:30]  Yes, the new monitor.  It's very slimming.  Just a little.  Opa obviously has to see a little.  Can you see that?  No, I can't see it.  I can't see it when it's straight on, actually.  There you go.  You've got to adjust the light.  We need to light up EROC a little bit more in there.  Yeah, EROC.  EROC, you need some lights on you.  He lurks in the shadows in that booth.  And he knows exactly where the camera is, because so many times when he doesn't want  to be picked on.  He's just out of it.  You notice.  Yes.  He moves backwards.  And then you're not sure if he's in there, so you're like, I'm not going to take my shot, 
[00:04:00]  because I'd rather take my shot right in front of his face.  Yep.  It's not fair to do it when he's taking a dump.  Then, like, out of nowhere, you just see this fucking hand with the little infant indented  knuckles.  Right.  Reaching for the board.  When he's part of the team, you see all of EROC.  Yeah.  Well, when he knows the heat is coming his way, he backs up a little bit.  Gets out of camera view.  EROC, is that true?  Come on.  EROC, comment.  Sure.  Wow.  He's just like, Jesus Christ. 
[00:04:30]  Music just started or stopped from the beginning of the show.  I got to say, EROC, I think Club Soda Kenny is on your side and sticks up for you, because  there was a little discussion on the way in this morning, and I asked Kenny a question,  and he goes, of course you have to.  You guys pick on him relentlessly.  Yikes.  Is Kenny a fan of yours, EROC?  Kenny is good people.  He's good people?  He's accusing us of bullying, I think, though.  I was very surprised by what Kenny said this morning. 
[00:05:00]  Do we bully EROC?  EROC, do you feel bullied?  Yes, and be a star.  Yeah, I hear you.  Well, why did Kenny say that?  Well, there might be...  Oh, no.  There might be another song that surfaced overnight.  Of course there is.  This will keep going until you finally decide to do something else. 
[00:05:30]  Read a news story or something.  Oh, we'll do that, too.  Yeah, we'll certainly do that, too.  Is it complimentary?  I like a good complimentary song.  I think it's very complimentary, to be honest with you.  What?  Yes.  No?  You don't see it that way?  Huh?  I mean, I didn't...  Wait a minute.  If Sam's even questioning it and not doing his bullshit...  No, this is great.  This is a well-done song.  You know it's bad.  Boy, we can't get anything past you these days.  Yeah.  It sucks.  He's really caught on, huh?  He really has, man. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to have to change my tune.  I didn't put it in the complimentary category myself, but...  I don't know.  Tannerite Mike, I would say, on Twitter.  Tannerite.  Tannerite Mike.  Yeah, let's do that.  Tannerite.  R-I-T-E.  Mike.  Tanner.  Yeah, whatever.  Okay.  He came up with this.  I'm just trying to give him a little plug on his Twitter.  Uh-huh.  You helped the show.  You get a plug on Twitter.  That's fair, right? 
[00:06:30]  It's nice.  Get some of those followers.  Right.  Sean F. did very well with followers yesterday.  He did.  And this is another one that makes a horribly insulting song about E-Rock, and then in the  description writes, I love E-Rock.  He's so great on the show.  Yeah.  See?  It's like, hey, I'll talk to that as well.  It's all just in fun.  It's an homage.  Eric?  Just play it already.  Oh.  You don't think it makes it okay when the people who write the songs make sure that  they mention what a big fan of yours they are? 
[00:07:00]  No, I don't, Sam.  Oh.  Wow.  It's like at the end of a roast when they go, ah, but I love you.  Yeah.  That's so true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's very confusing to me.  What was the roast recently?  Franco?  James Franco?  James Franco, yeah.  There's a lot of, but I love you at the end.  A lot of, yeah, but you know.  That's stupid, by the way.  Yeah.  Why do they do that, Jimmy?  It seems a little too forced.  I mean, I think when you're watching a roast, you feel like, in general, that the people  roasting you are truly your friends, even though they throw some other people in there 
[00:07:30]  just to get some attention.  I think that we're not, especially as time goes on and everybody's this phony politeness  too, we're taught less and less that you're supposed to be really outwardly mean to people.  Uh-huh.  Like, you know, they would even do that back in the old days, though.  Rickles would go, but he knows I love him.  I'm kidding.  He knows I'm kidding.  Right.  Because it is really weird to sit there and, yeah.  Normally you make fun of something, you don't just sit there and assault a person next to  you in front of everyone. 
[00:08:00]  When you fire off a bunch of great lines on someone, I mean, because you're attacking  their career.  Yes.  You're really getting them good.  Everything, yeah.  But there's got to be a better way to do the, but I love you part.  That part just always seems a little weird and forced.  Well, again, it's like two fighters hugging at the end of the match.  Yeah.  It's like what we're doing here is what we're doing here, and it's for the reasons that  it's for.  Right.  But, you know, when all is said and done, I really do respect you.  Nothing personal that I'm punching you in the face.  Right.  It's what we do.  I respect you, sure.  I like to feel that it's real.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Makes it a little more fun for me.  I do like a boxing match or a UFC match where the guys genuinely don't like each other.  Oh, yeah.  I love those.  I get bummed out when they kind of shake hands or give a good fist bump before the  fight.  I'm like, oh, man.  They kind of like each other and respect each other.  I'd rather just utter hatred.  Right.  So you know you're going to get a good fucking fight.  How about the utter hatred?  And then with Jimmy's point, at the end of it, they're like, holy fuck, I got to respect  you now.  That was a sick fight.  That is.  I like that, too, sometimes. 
[00:09:00]  I saw a fight once.  It was two guys and they're fucking just beating the shit out of each other.  And at the end, the guy, like, was talking to the crowd and totally turned them around.  I think it was in Russia.  Right.  And he was like, if we could get along here, then maybe everyone.  Yeah, yeah.  It was good.  Oh, we are getting along.  Look, you just missed it.  Obama and Putin.  Oh, yeah.  Hanging out together now.  Yeah, they're best of pals now.  Putin is now officially the world's leader, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  Good.  I think Obama's been bumped down to number two. 
[00:09:30]  Good.  Take it.  Take the fucking reins to be world police leader now, Putin.  Go ahead.  Have fun.  You think Putin's going to blow it, though?  No, I think they're just going to let Syria off the hook.  He's the man right now.  Putin is the man.  Yeah.  And if he plays it right, the fucking world's going to like Putin.  As he fucking sends weapons and missiles to fucking Iran.  Of course.  I know.  It's like...  I know.  It's ridiculous.  We aren't on the same team.  Can we just get that fucking straight here?  Russia and the U.S. are still not on the same team. 
[00:10:00]  And when Romney said that during the election, he was goofed on.  Right.  He was goofed on relentlessly.  Like, oh, the 80s called.  They want the Cold War back.  And it's like, no, they are still not like a Cold War enemy like they were, but no, they're  not our friends.  Let's get that straight.  And they do throw monkey wrenches into our fucking bullshit that we got to do.  And that's kind of what they're doing now.  But if we had a strong leader, that wouldn't happen, but I don't want to get into it right  now.  Because we have better things to do like E-Rock's fucking song. 
[00:10:30]  And very rarely after a fight, by the way, do you ever see the guys, like Nick Diaz, who's  a shit talker.  Right.  Even after the end of a fight, even he, they never dicks to each other at the end of  the fight.  Yeah.  It's really weird.  Two guys punch each other.  There's a bond they share that nobody in the audience has.  Even if they don't like each other.  Right.  They understand each other better than anyone in that crowd does.  The only time I remember shit talking was when Brock Lesnar did it.  Oh.  And he was shit talking the opponent and the sponsor and every, and then he got a talking  to, and that was the end of that.  And that even, he even said, was more from his wrestling background as part of the whole 
[00:11:00]  selling paper.  Fuck him anyways.  Brought down by a fucking sesame seed in his colon.  He'll be a big, tough guy.  I'll kick his ass.  Yeah, I bet you will.  He would be, uh, he would be safe in my son's school, though.  Oh, right.  Seedless and nutless, right?  Seedless and nutless.  Big fucking bruiser sitting at the seedless nutless table.  Seedless and nutless at the school my kid's going to.  I was telling Anthony, I, I don't know, man.  I don't know.  It is a weird world. 
[00:11:30]  How so?  Yeah.  Well, one of the things they discussed, I had to go and check out the school.  In the classroom, meet the teachers and meet the head of the place.  And, uh, they went over the rules and all that shit.  And, you know, we learned that it's a seedless nutless place.  And then they were talking about the allergy kids.  Yeah.  And I know there's a lot of parents out there with allergy kids.  We got one in my family as well, in my extended family.  So, but I don't understand.  And I just don't understand where these kids were growing up. 
[00:12:00]  I'm obsessed with this.  Because the ladies, like, and if you have a kid with the EpiPens, you need two EpiPens.  And we got to sign in the EpiPens.  And they got to be behind the EpiPen glass box.  I don't know.  I think they're putting them in a glass box so they can break the glass and get the EpiPen.  Oh, really?  And I don't remember growing up a kid getting hit with an EpiPen.  I'd never heard of an EpiPen when I was growing up.  Yeah.  Like, nobody had peanut allergies or EpiPens. 
[00:12:30]  A little known fact, I'm supposed to have an EpiPen.  You are?  Yes.  Because of the apples?  I blew it off, though.  Good for you.  Yeah.  I only had one incident.  And, you know, I was in the emergency room with a huge fucking swollen, ridiculous face.  Is it apples for you?  I know I'm very allergic to apples, trees, grass, cats, dogs.  Jesus.  Fuck.  Dust.  Trees, grass, and dust.  Well, when I went to theologist, I said, okay, I'm allergic to trees and grass.  What kind? 
[00:13:00]  You know?  Yeah.  It's a good thing there's not a lot of those on Earth.  Right.  But I'm like, what kind?  There are.  You're allergic to the planet.  Yes.  Right.  The things that produce oxygen.  Yes.  Yes.  Also allergic to people, obviously.  Wow.  But I go, all right, trees and grass.  Okay.  What kind of trees and grass?  He goes, no, trees and grass.  I thought he would give me a couple, like, specific kinds.  The elm.  Right.  Thank you.  The elm tree can make you sneeze.  I believe the birch.  The birch tree. 
[00:13:30]  The birch.  I think that is related to apples or something.  I don't know.  But anyway, so I just want to know where the Epi kids were when we were growing up.  I don't remember any kid dropping during fucking school.  Like, we just went.  I would remember that.  And then I asked Dan.  I asked Dan.  Did those kids just die?  And no, they didn't.  Because I don't remember any kids dying in Washington Drive School when I was just a little nugget.  They drowned in the sump.  They got hit by cars.  Thin ice was a big one.  Thin ice.  That was a big one when we were growing up. 
[00:14:00]  Sure, sure.  When we used to have winter.  Yeah.  That was many years ago.  But winter.  I never heard a kid eat a peanut and then fucking collapse in the cafeteria.  We laughed at peanuts growing up.  Need to be stabbed like he's fucking on the beaches of Normandy getting a morphine shot.  It just fucking.  Nothing.  Nothing.  What happened?  But what?  I don't know what has changed.  I don't know.  Because I just don't remember it.  I don't remember a kid being sequestered to eat his little sad lunch because he's allergic to everything. 
[00:14:30]  They put him at a whole separate table.  It seems like it's a real thing, though.  I know it's a real thing.  It's totally closed, right?  Yeah.  I know it's a real thing, but what I'm saying is we obviously have a couple generations represented here.  Our generation, we just didn't have this growing up.  There's got to be some kind of hormones that are going into pregnant ladies or something.  Do you think there was some twist in the last couple decades?  Or did we have it that we mistook it for something else?  I think we might have mistook it.  What did we think it was growing up? 
[00:15:00]  It had to be there.  I told Ann.  I think what it might have been was asthma.  When we were growing up, there were a lot of asthma.  It's true.  Nobody really has asthma.  When we were growing up, there were a lot of kids that had asthma.  You know what?  Maybe it was the peanuts.  And they had the inhalers.  Yeah.  Maybe it was peanuts.  I don't...  You don't see asthma as much because maybe now it's redirected to some kind of allergy  thing.  That's the only thing I can figure out.  Maybe inhalers will help peanut allergies.  I don't know.  But we didn't have kids flopping around at school because, you know, there was peanut dust and 
[00:15:30]  he touched a kid.  That's why they don't want any seeds or peanuts in this school because it's not that, you  know, the kid's going to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  He's fully aware he's allergic to peanuts because the parents, like, hammer it into his head  from an early age.  But they're talking about if my son has peanuts and then touches a kid.  Oh, yeah.  That's allergic.  That's all it could take.  Spreads like Ebola, apparently.  I don't know.  It's crazy.  I remember there was a lunch lady and she was called Mrs. Hazma. 
[00:16:00]  Mrs. Hazma.  And she was constantly yelling at everybody and the kids would be like, aha, you got a  hazma attack.  When you got yelled at by her, we called it a hazma attack.  Because you like to cut the line.  She'd be like, don't cut the line.  It's like, aha, you got a hazma attack.  That's pretty funny.  Mrs. Hazma.  I don't know.  I mean, people got answers, but it's not about answers today.  No.  It's just, it's all about.  We don't care about answers, really.  It's all about being confused. 
[00:16:30]  I just, uh.  I don't know where they went.  Because even if it was something else, like, but it was called something else.  Yeah.  I don't remember peanuts ever being lethal.  They are.  I want to make perfectly clear here that we know they're lethal.  All I'm saying is, I don't know where this was when we were growing up.  It's chemical warfare at this point.  It's like a poison dart.  Yeah, yeah.  Peanut dust is like fucking crazy, like sarin gas.  Yeah.  You spread it over schools.  Can you imagine the children?  Oh, man.  Peanut dust.  That's all you need, really. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, and then, uh, really fast, uh, the first political correctness thing happened yesterday  at the school.  Uh-oh.  It's your first day.  Yeah.  What happened?  You know what you have?  Oh.  Oh, Louis C.K.  Happy birthday to Louis C.K.  46 years old today.  Is that a short clip?  Yeah, it's only a minute 46 on nut allergies.  All right, let's go with this.  Oh, yeah.  Really fast.  Then we'll move on.  I've got your bad thoughts.  Hopefully you do good things.  Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. 
[00:17:30]  Hopefully the good thoughts win.  For me, I always have both.  I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing.  That's the thing I believe.  And then there's this thing.  And I don't believe it, but it is there.  It's always this thing, and then this thing.  It's become a category in my brain that I call, of course, but maybe.  I'll give you an example.  Okay, like, of course, of course, children who have nut allergies need to be protected. 
[00:18:00]  Of course.  We have to segregate their food from nuts, have their medication available at all times,  and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies.  Of course.  Of course.  But maybe.  Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you're supposed to die. 
[00:18:30]  Jesus.  Of course not.  Of course not.  Of course not.  Of course.  Jesus.  I have a nephew who has that.  I'd be devastated if something happened to him.  But maybe, maybe, if we all just do this for one year, we're done with nut allergies forever. 
[00:19:00]  No.  Of course not.  Wow.  The brilliance of Louis C.K.  Jesus.  Happy birthday, Lou.  Louis.  Well, I don't think any type of child being sick is fodder for humor.  That's just my take.  I'm offended by that, and I don't think he should be able to do comedy anymore.  What a great, what a brilliant way to set it up, too, of course, and maybe.  Yeah.  Because you can talk about anything in that context, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course not. 
[00:19:30]  So, it was parent night, you know, introduction to the school, the teachers, the classroom,  and all that.  And then they were going through the schedule and things that, you know, could be expected  when your kid attends school there.  And they used to have something called Leadership Day.  Leadership Day.  It's already begun.  So, they used to have something called Leadership Day.  And basically, you know, it's your kid's turn to kind of be a leader for the day.  And it's just dumb stuff.  Like, if there's an announcement in the class, your kid gets to do it. 
[00:20:00]  Or if they're going to the gym and they have to line up, he leads the line.  Just dumb shit, right?  Good way to make a nice little Hitler.  Jesus.  So, they said, well, you know, policy has changed and we no longer call it Leadership Day.  Oh, boy.  And I looked around the room quickly, because this is something I've been very curious about  way before even having kids.  Like, where the fuck does this shit come from?  And I truly believed for a very long time that it was the parents just becoming idiots 
[00:20:30]  and assholes.  Yeah.  Like, the majority.  So, I looked around and I saw all the looks.  And then the teacher goes, we still have it, but we just call it Hosting Day.  Ew.  So, your kid gets to be the host for the day.  Well, so you're not the boss.  Right.  Right, right.  How you doing, everybody?  Right.  Feeling good tonight?  Right.  Come on.  And as the teachers were saying this, they were kind of almost rolling their eyes like,  look, we know this is ridiculous.  And they hinted that someone had a problem with this. 
[00:21:00]  The kids play follow the host now.  Right.  Right.  So, they changed it from leader to host.  And then I quickly looked around the room again.  I wanted to see the reaction.  Every single, I swear there wasn't one.  Now, one parent that went, oh, you know, this is a very good thing for our children.  They all were rolling their eyes, sighing, looking at their spouses like, what?  So, who comes up with this shit?  It's the one fucking person that complains.  And then the school, in this case, collapses and caters to the one weak fucking parent that 
[00:21:30]  can't talk to their kid.  If their kid has a problem with being a leader or what that means to them, then it's your  job to sit them down and work around that.  Isn't teaching kids to be leaders a good thing?  Yeah.  Like, aren't kids supposed to learn leadership qualities?  No, apparently not anymore.  And it comes down to this.  When your kids leave the school and go into the real world, those aren't the rules that  you're going to follow in society.  Everyone knows that.  Leadership qualities have always been, like, a good thing. 
[00:22:00]  Were you tempted to ask, like, can I ask without being a disruptive parent, like, can  I ask what the purpose of that is?  You'd be a problem, then.  But you might, all the other parents might want to know, too.  You might just have more balls on them to ask.  I probably would ask, you know, like, not in front of everyone on the first day.  I don't want to come across as...  That guy?  The person I'm going to come across as.  Difficult.  I like giving it a little time.  You'll be difficult.  There was no reason to ask, because you could tell the teachers were like, you know, we 
[00:22:30]  have this, this, this, or...  It came from the mysterious place upstairs, I'm sure.  Sure.  Like, the teacher can't tell you where it came from, the parents can't tell you, but  it's like, oh, yeah, well, upstairs, they...  Obviously, it's a little thing, it's a subtle thing, but it's ridiculous.  Yeah, it is.  And I now know from just us talking about it over the years, that it's not the majority  of parents.  I really thought it was, for a long time.  It's the very, very small minority.  Yeah.  But for some reason, their voice is louder than the majority, and I just don't understand 
[00:23:00]  that.  I think a lot of times, too, it comes from these fucking dumb administrators.  It's not...  No one even complained about it, but the administrators think like, oh, you know, I don't like that  leadership thing.  Let's call it hosting day.  Hosting day.  Oh, God.  You're today's host.  Jeez.  That's like what Snooki does at Bargain.  Right.  Yeah.  Lieutenant Johnson will be hosting the battle today.  Right.  He'll be hosting you into battle. 
[00:23:30]  What do you need, a two-host soda?  Oh, that's different, Jimmy.  But when my kid comes home, I'll tell him, I'll go, so how was being a leader today?  You know, I'll try my workarounds.  I don't know.  I don't know what else to do.  I was a host, Dad.  Oh, God.  No, you weren't a host.  And kids end up being pumped out of schools, being expected to be just waiting to be told  what to do.  Yeah.  Right.  Like, with no sort of get-up-and-go-ness. 
[00:24:00]  I think if society was changing drastically, then fine, do all this in school.  But it's not.  It's not.  You're pushing these kids out into the real world, and they're not treated like equals,  and next thing you know, they're jumping off the top of a building somewhere because  they can't handle it.  What happened?  Wouldn't it be nicer if they explained why they did it?  Like, if the teacher goes, look, here's the thinking behind this, because, you know,  a couple of these little bastards just, you know, as soon as they're in charge, they  pick up rocks and they hit the other kids with it.  Wouldn't that at least make you go, all right, I kind of get why they're too young right  now to understand leadership and how to delegate responsibility? 
[00:24:30]  They had to be careful, but they were vague, but it was very obvious what it was.  There was somebody in years past, within the last couple of years, actually, someone  complained.  And the school said, oh, okay, and catered to that, you know, that parent.  Don't lib fuck parents in there.  The kid comes home.  I was the leader today.  No, we don't need that.  Right.  Like, why would you be the leader over anybody else?  Right.  Or I wasn't the leader.  Yeah.  Or I wasn't the leader.  Right, right.  I wasn't the leader. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, well.  Right.  But you're right.  They never tell the parent, like, well, we're sorry you feel that way, but we feel,  they just never do.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, we could bring it back to ourselves and radio and radio shows that  get kicked off the air because the very, very tiny minority has a massive voice, and the  people that enjoy a certain radio show, you know, the majority, they get fucked in the  end.  Exactly.  It's unbelievable.  So, that was about it.  Wow. 
[00:25:30]  And then just kind of looking around the room going, ugh.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I pray most of these people aren't in my home.  Like, just thinking which of these assholes are going to end up on my couch?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You now have a relationship in some way, shape, or form with these people.  People were, like, you know, looking for a little contact, a little talk, and I just  heverted my eyes the whole time.  Shut him down?  Yes.  Because I'm like, shut him right down.  I'll have a wait and see on this one.  Just stay the fuck out of my life. 
[00:26:00]  I know how to read people, and there are a few, and they're playing their parts, and  I'm just like, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, whatever.  So, what does this have to do with the E-Rock song?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was mean.  I mean, I think that, uh, are we officially doing an E-Rock parody song contest?  I thought we weren't.  Oh, man.  Well, I don't even think we need to do an official contest.  I don't think we have to either.  I think the listeners are taking it upon themselves to just feel like, oh, I can be a part of  the show if I do this.  E-Rock, we can't control the listeners when they take it upon themselves to do this type 
[00:26:30]  of thing.  You do understand that, right?  Why do you keep talking to me about this?  We're not really pushing this forward, is what I want you to know.  The listeners have figured out they're guaranteed to get on the air.  Yeah.  Like an E-Rock song.  And then they get Twitter followers out of it.  Yeah, they do.  Like, uh, Sean F., Mondo270.  He did very well with the Twitter followers yesterday.  Yeah, we could turn that camera a little and get more of E-Rock and less of the glass  in front of the thing, right?  Yeah, what? 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  Yeah, we don't need the glass.  We need more coverage.  Yeah.  Can we get more coverage on E-Rock?  Yeah, you want me to turn the lights on in there?  Oh, gee.  No, the camera, Ant's right.  Yeah, the camera could be turned.  E-Rock is all the way to the left of the screen.  E-Rock, could you get up on the chair and turn the camera, please?  Oh, boy.  He's not having it.  He's still sitting in the chair.  Yeah, he's not.  All right, we'll have Mars fix that.  Where's Mars?  He's here.  All excited.  The new phone program. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  That font is pretty small.  I know I like a big font, but that font's pretty small on the phone thing, right?  Yeah, it's bad.  It makes that a little bigger.  I can't tell what the fuck people want.  Mars.  Sir.  We need a bigger font on this.  Yes, sir.  Not now.  And we want to see E-Rock better.  If we could turn that camera toward the E-Rock.  Less glass, more E-Rock.  I could do it right now.  Less glass, more ass.  E-Rock Anthony said that one. 
[00:28:00]  Anybody knows I'm kidding.  It's all part of the show.  That's right.  E-Rock's like a cactus, like Mr. Amos does.  That's right.  We're all just kidding.  Right.  It's all fun.  It's all fun.  We're all just kidding.  It's all fun in the end, like a roast.  Right.  Yeah.  But we love you.  Except E-Rock doesn't get to go up to the dais.  No, he doesn't.  He likes a good roast, though.  Oh.  Oh, see?  That's a food joke.  But that's good.  What would you do?  Put in barbecue sauce?  I do chuckle.  A few people are like,  Hey, E-Rock, you should have told him that barbecue sauce has a lot of salt and sugar. 
[00:28:30]  You got your fans out there, E-Rock.  Yeah.  You know you do.  With that, let's play the latest E-Rock song.  Sure.  But we love them.  But we love them.  This song is a parody of the song Roar.  Oh.  Don't give away what this guy calls it.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think you almost did.  I almost did.  You're right.  Wow.  It's a nice reveal.  That would have sucked.  It's a nice reveal. 
[00:29:00]  You eat cold, Chef Boyardee?  Cold SpaghettiOs.  Oh, God.  It's just a minute.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  It's chicken and stars.  It doesn't even get, like, good soup.  Wait, what's chicken and stars?  Chicken and pasta shaped as stars.  You eat raw hot dogs?  The Oscar Mayer cheese ones?  I'll eat it raw.  You're such a weirdo.  Did your wife ever catch you eating a fucking out-of-the-fridge cold cheese weenie?  Because that's eventually what's going to spark the fucking stabbing with the scissors  or the fucking call to the lawyer.  It's going to be, she peeks in the room, he's watching cartoons eating a fucking frozen 
[00:29:30]  cheese weenie, and then she's going to fucking hire someone to cut his throat.  He doesn't have an ounce of self-respect.  Exercise is something he neglects, so he sits quietly, eating Chef Boyardee.  He never pays attention to the show, stuffs his face with tubs of cookie dough, oinks like  a piggy, fuck, fuck, big bitch titties.  Request a song, he'll play one, but oh no, it's a live version. 
[00:30:00]  Where's E-Rock?  We need him now.  He's working on the phones with Sal, a full-grown man that plays with dolls.  Sex, bagel, loves chicken and stars.  Cholesterol, butterball.  He's got a gut like a tire, but wider.  Inhales appetizers.  His ass fills a canyon.  And E-Rock is as fat as a boy. 
[00:30:30]  Rounder than a bison.  Children get frightened.  Cause E-Rock is as fat as a boy.  E-Rock is a dilosaur.  That's not very nice. 
[00:31:00]  Were those his footsteps at the end?  I think so, yeah, yeah.  It was from Jurassic Park.  It wasn't nice.  No.  He leaned out of the camera again.  Oh.  Can you take a look, Sam?  And this is after Mars readjusted the camera.  Yes, he's...  But he's still out of...  He's lurking in the shadows again.  Yeah, he looks very unhappy.  He's almost holding his hands like Brando in The Godfather.  He's got his fingertips all kind of pushed together.  More like an apocalypse now. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, jeez.  He's waving at me, but also scowling.  All right, waving's good, though.  Yeah.  Could you fix the fat, Kim?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  See.  See what he looks like after that one.  Okay, now he's not looking at me.  He's looking at the floor.  Looks like he's contemplating what his next move is.  Ask him if he liked it. 
[00:32:00]  Okay.  Hey, buddy.  Okay, he's flipping me off right now.  Oh.  Did you hear the song?  Thumbs up.  Did you like the song?  Okay, flipping me off again.  Oh, that's not good.  That's the universal symbol for fuck you is what that is.  It's Mars.  There you go.  That's it.  Now that's a good fucking view right there.  That's a terrific view.  What about when Norton called it the fat cam?  Little nickname?  Okay, that's two fingers.  Oh, wow.  Two fingers. 
[00:32:30]  Not good.  Two fingers.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  What song is that?  That's the Katy Perry song.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Huge hit.  Roar.  Except, uh...  The girls like that one.  And the boys.  I mean, the mashup, I'm assuming, is what you're talking about.  Yeah, the gals, they're playing that song a couple times an hour.  The ladies down the hall.  Three-quarters men on that show, I thought.  They throw the ball around a little bit, and then they play the Katy Perry song.  That's their show.  And they kind of just go, hey, girls, what do you think of the song? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, the gals.  I'm fascinated now with the rock cam.  I can't stop looking at it.  Why?  I don't know.  He's like, he's running his hand over his face.  He goes, oh, and I can't not watch this.  This is the best show on television.  Fuck cam, girls.  Yeah.  You do an E-rock cam.  E-rock cam.  That's right.  When we're playing these songs, I'm telling you, it would do very well.  How great would it be if the show had a visual element with Sirius just put the E-rock cam on the website? 
[00:33:30]  That would be great.  And it was a hit.  Yes.  I would love it.  I would.  E-rock, you would love that.  Let me see what he's saying.  Would you love that, buddy?  He's shaking his head no.  No, he wouldn't.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I was clever.  The guy took his time.  He settled in.  Yeah.  Had a lot of show references.  Oh, yeah.  Certainly did.  He did his homework.  His voice, a little, you know. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, you know, but it's a parody.  Yeah, yeah.  There was no shoehorning.  There was a little bit of shoehorning there.  Not like Todd shoehorning.  No.  I feel like we tend to look past a lot of quality issues when content is such a matter.  Yeah, when the punchline is a boar or an elephant noise.  We're all in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't care how you got there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the listeners have kind of figured out if they can be exceptionally cruel, the voice, 
[00:34:30]  the singing voice doesn't matter as much.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  But that guy likes E-Rock, so it's all good.  Well, it's all in good fun.  And we all love E-Rock.  We love you.  He's never said no, as far as the show goes.  Well.  Oh.  There are more jokes ready to go, but of course.  They're just mean statements.  Of course they are.  Yeah.  Terrible.  See, he says, I love E-Rock.  He makes the show what it is.  He's easily the most talented member of the production staff.  There you go. 
[00:35:00]  So how can you not like that guy?  Who's on the production staff?  Him and Sal?  Yeah, it's him and Sal.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Well.  All right.  It's kind of a drop-off.  Yay, by default.  He just made me snort.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Good job.  Good job to that guy.  Very good.  Oh, I want to know if Scott and Todd are doing parody songs. 
[00:35:30]  Today?  Maybe a little warm-up to Jocktober.  I don't know.  You want to know?  Can you find a Scott and Todd parody song today, E-Rock?  E-Rock knows other radio shows.  Are they doing any parody songs right now?  That's all they do.  Do we find, like, a current one?  Yeah.  Oh, a current one?  I don't have.  I have older ones in here.  No, I know that, but we...  We can monitor their show.  They do one every day.  I know they do one every day, so I want to see which one they're...  Topical.  Do they do a Miley Cyrus twerking one?  They probably did.  I bet you they have one done to blurred lines. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They probably got a Putin song.  A Putin song.  Syria!  Dun-dun-dun!  You got some nerve gas!  Syria!  You got, you know, let's fucking...  You just rattle them off.  You just gave them a fucking idea.  Oh, hell yeah.  I can't believe they're still on the radio.  What?  Good for them.  They're killing it.  They're killing it.  They're killing it.  They kill it in the ratings?  No.  Come on.  I mean, they survive. 
[00:36:30]  That's stupid.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We'll shake your butt, baby.  Twerk and pout.  Twerk and pout.  You've got a million of them.  I'm a machine.  Oh.  We could just do it, and, you know, that's the Miley Cyrus thing.  Just pick a topic in the news.  Let her rip.  Hey, E-Rock, don't be defiant today.  I want to do Johnny Cash Day.  Is that cool with you?  E-Rock has momentarily stepped out of the office. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, wow.  Where'd he go?  Oh, Roland's in there.  Hi, Roland.  Where's Eric?  He went to go set up the Scott and Todd recording.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, oh.  He's doing some show-related things.  Yeah, all right.  He's not just hoofing around back there.  He's actually outworking.  He's taking a nice deuce yesterday morning.  Wasn't there dead air because he thought he could get back in time, and he didn't?  Well, there were two things this week.  First, yesterday, in the middle of the break, you know, we do the double break, and there 
[00:37:30]  was like five seconds of dead air because he didn't get back to the studio on time.  He didn't get back after making duties.  But on Tuesday morning, Sal needed some kind of confirmation on something for the podcast,  and he was like, E-Rock, I need this real quick.  You know, just give me a confirmation that this is the right thing so I can send it in.  And E-Rock was like, no, no, I have to go to the bathroom.  No, no, I have to go to the bathroom.  All right.  Did he have to do a one or a two?  My assumption?  I would think a two. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, there he is.  We got him on camera.  What?  That's a whale.  Oh, I thought that was the...  No, his camera's over here.  His screen's over here.  It's a white whale, a rare white whale.  Spotted near Australia.  That's right.  A white whale, like fucking Moby Dick.  What, is he scared?  Oh.  The white whale. 
[00:38:30]  What the hell's going on with a...  How many white whales do we have out there?  I don't know.  I just heard Moby Dick.  I want to go, like, whale watching.  Yeah?  Yeah, I want to check out some whales.  How do you do that?  Oh, it just looks scary.  Can you do it off Montauk?  I think you do it on a boat.  I don't think there's many whales on the East Coast, are there?  I don't know.  I think you've got to go out there to...  No, you can do it in...  That's horny.  Cape Cod.  Yeah, okay.  That's true.  Yeah, you've got to go up, like, north, right?  Well, you've got to go, you know...  What's that?  Hyannis. 
[00:39:00]  Hyannis?  No.  What's the tip of Cape Cod where it's a bit artsy and mysterious?  P-Town.  P-Town.  You've got to go to P-Town.  They have whale watching in P-Town.  A lot of mystery, too.  A lot of mystery.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Very mysterious.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this supposed to be, like, funny? 
[00:39:30]  Like, when people hear that, they just fucking start cracking up.  Oh, yeah.  I can't wait for Jocktober.  Yeah.  I just love how the listeners get involved with all the Facebook pages and just start posting  horrid things.  And should the listeners start, I don't know, tweeting you or whatever?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tweet me at not Sam Jocktober suggestions.  Yeah.  Because maybe we don't have to feature a show every day. 
[00:40:00]  Maybe we could start featuring, like, a bunch of bits.  Yeah.  Bits.  Just change it up a little bit.  I got some things I'm already working on that you guys are going to like.  Oh?  Just to change it up a little bit.  Yeah.  I like when we feature shows.  Don't get me wrong.  But maybe we could do some other things a little differently.  Nothing.  Parody song day, maybe, or...  Nothing makes me feel worse than the internet attacks.  I always go home feeling like a horrible person.  Feel bad about that?  Yep.  Why?  Because it's just really ruining somebody's life for that moment.  They are brutal, too.  They don't care what they post. 
[00:40:30]  Like, they're just sitting there.  These DJs or, you know, PDs or whatever, just sitting there trying to live their life  and be friendly and have this little radio show.  And for no reason, a whole bunch of people just start putting the most horrific things.  Yeah.  I was on the other side of that recently with that kickstop shit.  It's tough, right?  It's not fun.  Well, that was real.  People are angry.  These are just silly.  That was like people being...  Oh, boy.  That was not fun, but that's not going to stop us from...  It's not.  No, continue with Norway.  Try to throw some compassion into this thing. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, boy.  It wasn't fun, though.  Wow.  Wow.  When did you start to realize, like, oh, boy.  Like, at first, you get, like, a few, like, hey, you're a dick.  And you're like, all right, whatever.  It was just...  So what happened that you were like, ugh?  I just had to turn it off.  It was endless.  It was hundreds of thousands of hate tweets.  It was unbelievable how bad it was.  I just had to shut down everything.  People with a complete lack of understanding.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  And then they move on to the next stupid thing.  Oh, yeah.  What happened to Coney?  Did they get him?  Joseph Coney? 
[00:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  What happened to him?  No?  I don't know.  No one cares?  Remember when that was the big fucking thing?  That guy had that meltdown, and that just seemed to fuck everything up.  Oh, yeah.  Started jacking off on the sidewalk.  Yeah, so you might never have a cause after you jerk off on the corner.  No.  Yeah, boy.  E-Rock, you were gone.  We're doing Johnny Cash Day today.  Do you know any Johnny Cash songs?  Yeah.  Me and Jimmy could give you a little list of songs.  Yeah.  He died 10 years ago today.  That's a quick 10 years.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  10 years.  Who?  Johnny Cash.  Oh, my God.  He died 10 years ago today.  Wow.  10 fucking years?  I was in the car with Florentine going to the airport talking about it right after.  I can't believe that was a decade ago.  At the age of 71.  Yeah.  Right before we came back to radio, I guess.  Not right before.  About a year.  Whatever.  Wow.  Wow.  Damn.  Johnny Cash Day, huh?  Oh, that's right.  You don't like Johnny Cash.  It's not like when it's played, I get that mad, like, oh, God, I hate that. 
[00:42:30]  It's not that.  It's just.  I'm surprised you wouldn't like Johnny Cash.  There are a couple of songs I like.  Because you kind of go into country a little bit.  A couple of songs I like, but it's just too much of the same thing.  Really?  How about Ain't No Grave?  You ever hear that?  That's much later after he had a stroke, I think.  Yeah.  I don't know Ain't No Grave.  Ain't No Grave, Iraq?  Iraq knows Ain't No Gravy.  Can we play that?  Ain't No Gravy. 
[00:43:00]  We've never played that, have we?  I think so.  Oh.  I'll find you.  Let's play this into break.  Johnny Cash Day.  There ain't no grave can hold my body down.  There ain't no grave can hold my body down.  When I hear that trumpet sound, I'm gonna rise right out of the ground.  Ain't no grave can hold my body down.  Well, look way down the river, and what do you think I see? 
[00:43:30]  I see a band of angels, and they're coming after me.  Ain't No Grave can hold my body down.  There ain't No Grave can hold my body down.  Well, look down yonder, Gabriel.  Put your feet on the land and sea. 
[00:44:00]  But, Gabriel, don't you blow your trumpet till you hear from me.  There ain't no grave can hold my body down.  Ain't no grave can hold my body down.  There ain't no grave can hold my body down. 
[00:44:30]  Well, meet me in the middle of the air, and if these wings don't fail me, I will meet you anywhere.  Ain't no grave can hold my body down. 
[00:45:00]  There ain't no grave can hold my body down.  Well, meet me, mother and father.  Meet me down the river road.  And, Mama, you know that I'll be there when I check in, my Lord.  Ain't no grave can hold my body down.  There ain't no grave can hold my body down.  There ain't no grave can hold my body down. 
[00:45:30]  There ain't no grave can hold my body down.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Continues.  Early one morning while making the rounds 
[00:46:00]  I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down  I went right home and I went to bed  I stuck that love in 44 beneath my head  Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun  Took a shot of cocaine and away I run  Made a good run but I run too slow  They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico 
[00:46:30]  Made in the hot joys taking the pill  Is this from the prison concert?  No.  The sheriff from Jericho Hill  He said, well, Ely, your name is not Jack Brown  I find that kind of hilarious.  I think we talked about it last time.  So many people didn't have the opportunity to see Johnny Cash.  They just couldn't get tickets or what have you.  And then, you know, you had to murder someone  To go to have the opportunity to see Johnny Cash.  Yeah, you could see him. 
[00:47:00]  How do you feel about artists going to prison  And entertaining those guys?  I don't think they do it anymore, do they?  I think that's kind of a politically incorrect thing to do.  They realize, wow, you know, that...  Yeah, why am I entertaining these fucking monsters?  That creates a lot of uproar.  Yeah.  Do you like this one?  Because he had that rolling guitar in there.  Yeah.  I remember you saying that.  I don't know.  I don't know what to make of Johnny Cash. 
[00:47:30]  It's, you know, it's what it is.  I thank Jimmy.  I'll say it again.  I would tool around the city with Jimmy when he was doing sets  And he had a Johnny Cash cassette.  And that's when I was all in after that.  Because I only knew kind of the hits in general.  Boy Named Sue and Ringing Fire.  Do you hear The Beast Is Me?  The Beast In Me?  That was after a movie, I think.  It was off one of the...  I forget what movie used The Beast In Me at the end of it. 
[00:48:00]  It wasn't Lincoln.  It was some weird, out-of-place movie.  It was one like that.  Well, we'll play that one next, all right, Iraq?  Let Jimmy...  Just get it ready.  Let Jimmy pick the Johnny Cash songs.  The only one I'd request is Ray-a-far.  Ray-a-far.  But besides that, let Jimmy pick the rest of them.  He knows this shit.  Char.  Did we find the Scott and Todd parody song?  They haven't played one yet.  What?  They went 20 minutes.  What's wrong with them?  Crazy.  Well, they got music and commercials to do. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, God.  What else are they talking about?  Nothing.  There's nothing there.  I'd just like to know what...  Like, recently, what have they parodied in song?  It's got to be all that topical stuff.  Unless he doesn't do it anymore, do they just pull out the old song parodies, the generics?  There's generics that they play if he didn't come up with something, but usually he'll have  something new at the top of the show.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, it's a SoundCloud page. 
[00:49:00]  Hold on.  Go to the top.  What's his last one?  These are not all parodies.  Oh, they're not all songs.  Some are on there.  A lot of it's just interviews.  Yeah.  Ugh.  You guys want to hear the Carlos Danger theme?  I think we did that one, didn't we?  Did we?  Did we?  No.  Oh, really?  No.  Anthony Weiner.  Anthony Weiner's walking around town pissed off.  Oh, yeah.  He's starting to look a little scary.  Oh, he's...  They snapped him with his kid yesterday.  Did they?  While his wife is looking all hot and shit, like hailing a cab.  They weren't, you know, shot together yesterday. 
[00:49:30]  Of course.  And he's holding his kid, and he wants to bite someone's face off.  Yeah, he's angry.  He is not a happy man.  That Carlos Danger song.  All right.  It's kind of hot.  Weiner has sent a lot of texts that we've never seen before.  Girls get pictures of the guy with his pants down on the floor. 
[00:50:00]  He's got energy, he cannot save.  So he made up a secret on my name.  Poorly, Carlos Danger.  Let's put the weird owl sound.  Poorly, Carlos Danger.  Very weird owl sound.  Hey, he's like doing a weird owl impression. 
[00:50:30]  Poorly, Carlos Danger.  Loves to show his one-eyed monster.  All right, this is terrible.  Danger and monster don't run.  No.  I swear to you, our listeners do a much better job.  Hell yeah.  Do you even know what he's parodying in that song?  I, I, it's wrecking, yeah.  What is it?  I can't think of it.  Power Ranger or something?  Yes, Power Ranger.  Right, right.  Very good.  Because that's relevant and not 1990.  Holy shit.  Really?  Yeah.  He should have said Pekka. 
[00:51:00]  He should have said Pekka.  Why?  That would have, uh.  He's taking out his fucking Pekka.  That would have been really good.  And in some electric guitar.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah, why wear a white shirt?  Jesus Christ.  Do you know how happy that's making me?  Oh, no.  Right now, there's wiping fucking hot sauce off the front of the white shirt.  I, I couldn't be happier.  What happened?  Watching someone spill something on a white shirt and ruin it.  Jesus.  Why ever wear white? 
[00:51:30]  You gotta, like, be careful the entire day.  True.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I'm trying to, I'm so trying to eat way better.  I, I usually eat all right.  And, uh, after that whole, like, school thing, they had sandwiches.  Sandwiches.  So I kind of, like, and they had cookies.  I was able to, like, say no to all the crap.  Had a little healthy, like, wrap.  Yeah.  Then I get home and I'm like, all you have to do, man, is go to bed.  And you had a good day of eating. 
[00:52:00]  Couldn't do it, huh?  That's all you have to do.  And it was bedtime, too.  Uh-huh.  It was 9, 930.  That's when I started thinking about it.  What bit of deliciousness was taunting you?  I had a huge bowl of Lucky Charms right before bed.  All I had to do was go to bed.  Lucky Charms.  And I was fighting it.  It's sugar with me.  Fuck.  They are magically delicious.  For me, it's salt.  Yeah, they are.  Salt?  Yeah.  So you need those pretzels or, and it's weird because, I wasn't starving, but my brain 
[00:52:30]  was craving it.  I'm like, just go to bed.  And we just stopped off at the supermarket, get milk and shit, and she got the Lucky Charms  with the kid.  Oh, it was a new box?  New box.  What's better than opening up a new box of sugary cereal?  They're not mushy yet.  No.  There's still like, there's a little crunch.  Did you use a bowl that's normally not supposed to be used for cereal?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a serving bowl.  Like a salad bowl.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:53:00]  It's the one that has the fake fruit in it.  Right.  He's dumping on the floor.  Oh, I was so close.  You know what I did yesterday?  If I just laid my head down, 10 more minutes of craving, I would have fell asleep, I would  have been good for the Lucky Charms.  Sometimes you gotta throw that shit out.  I was so, like, I've eaten bad for like the last week or two, and yesterday I was like,  I had some pretzels and some almonds in my house.  I was like, you fucking cunt.  And I went in, I took them all, and I just threw them down the chute.  I'm like, no, I'm not gonna fucking start down this road.  Don't ever get a kid then, because that's the problem. 
[00:53:30]  There's a lot more shit around, because, you know, the kids, you can't make them eat  celery sticks every day.  They gotta be kids, right?  Yeah.  Fuck, I was almost there.  It's like when my mom used to get the AIDS diet plan.  Right.  My mom had the AIDS, and it was this chocolate, and we used to eat it, because it was like  she wouldn't have, like, sweets in the house for the most part, but that we'd be, and she's  like, stop eating my AIDS.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go anyplace.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12. 
[00:54:00]  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite, so you lose weight, yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant.  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  It's the greatest thing ever.  It's unbelievable.  I know people out there are going, oh, that's a funny parody, you guys.  No. 
[00:54:30]  That was a real product.  That was a real product.  It was spelled.  Well, their business fell apart.  Boy, did that business just drop right off.  Every day, he probably wakes up and thinks, why did I name it that?  Like, literally, that's like coming out with the greatest shampoo, and they're like, why  did you name it cancer?  It's with a K.  Oh.  It's with a K.  AIDS.  Yeah.  We used to eat that.  I guess it was an appetite suppressant. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  So you'd eat them, and then you weren't hungry.  It's like, there's us kids in the house just eating the AIDS.  Did it taste good?  No, but it was kind of chocolatey.  Well, it's the old cooking chocolate thing.  We've talked about that, too.  Yeah, that, too.  You'd open up the fucking cabinet and see cooking chocolate and be like, ooh, chocolate,  and you eat it, and it's bitter.  We didn't have sweets in the house ever, because we were either poor or my mom was convinced  we were poor.  To this day, I have no idea how poor we really were.  Because she obsessed about money my entire fucking life.  But we would see the cooking chocolate, and it just looks like real chocolate. 
[00:55:30]  It looks too much like chocolate.  You would get disappointed every time, and you knew every time that it was going to be  some bitter shit, but you still had to go for it, because it just looked like the real  thing.  Did you try a Quest Bar either of you guys?  No.  Quest Bar?  Yeah.  One of my trainers told me to eat them occasionally.  Like, you don't eat them, but it's protein, but there's not a lot of sugar in them.  They're like 170 calories, but they're not bad.  Like, not nearly as bad as these other fucking protein bars that have a lot of shit in them. 
[00:56:00]  And I'll eat one of them sometimes before I work out, but I don't like to make a habit  of it.  A little chicken sometimes.  I don't want to babble.  Oh, yeah.  I could.  We had shit in the house.  I would have rather had, like, coffee soda.  She'd have coffee soda.  What are you talking about?  My mother would.  She'd have coffee soda before.  It was terrible.  AIDS and coffee soda.  And as a kid, you just want something good.  Right.  Like, fucking, I want Coke or RC Cola, even.  The one.  Coffee soda and AIDS. 
[00:56:30]  It's terrible.  Having seven plus kids growing up in our household, because like I said, you know, we had kids  coming and going.  We were up to nine at one point, I think.  Oh, boy.  Then, of course, you know, the colored girl that came for the summer.  Attic dweller.  I don't know.  The guy in the attic, he needed to eat, too, I guess, because, you know, my sister was  bringing food up to the attic.  One thing I'm glad about, for real, is that we couldn't really afford soda, so we never 
[00:57:00]  had soda in the house.  I mean, never.  I mean, if we went somewhere else, we certainly would have a can of soda here and there.  Oh, yeah.  To this day, I'm not a soda guy.  No.  And I'm kind of happy about that.  There is a time where an ice cold Coke just chugging that thing down and just burning  everything from the night before out of your fucking esophagus.  But Coke, I can't drink straight Coke anymore, like, with the sugar.  Diet Coke?  No.  I don't like Coke.  It's got to be really cold.  Yes.  And you get some crushed ice.  I'm not saying I don't enjoy a soda every once in a while, but when I finally have a 
[00:57:30]  soda, I really, really enjoy it.  Only because your mouth has that sugar, like, that weird sugar aftertaste.  It's too much.  Like, the Diet Coke, for some reason, I just like better.  It's not even the calories.  And I always like Pepsi over Coke.  That could be it.  Pepsi has kind of lost the battle, I think.  Pepsi?  I don't see Pepsi as much, but I was a Pepsi.  I liked Pepsi if I was going soda.  Regular Pepsi is tolerable.  When I went on Diet Coke, you're like, Diet Pepsi, okay?  It's like, why don't you just crush up some St. Joseph's aspirin and piss into it? 
[00:58:00]  Because that's what that tastes like, fucking bitch.  I didn't say Diet Pepsi.  You have to call her a bitch?  Yeah, because how about this?  Hey, here's my thing.  Gratuity.  Instead of gratuity, is a ripped up napkin punched into your tits acceptable?  I'm so mad about your soft drinks.  Exactly.  I certainly am.  Justifiably so.  I think it leads to the next little bit.  Oh, what is that?  Got another bit from Twitter.  I appreciate it. 
[00:58:30]  Twitter?  Yeah, people send in their shit overnight.  It's nice.  Get a little, kind of read the Twitter a little bit, and then, you know, you get a couple bits  for the show every once in a while.  I was having a little problem with Twitter last night.  Couldn't see any pictures.  I'd click on a link for a picture, and it would look like it was loading.  Right.  And the screen would just be like a blank screen.  Do you need to update your app?  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  That's happened to me where I couldn't do it.  But it's not, there's no prompt for an update or anything, so.  Who the fuck knows? 
[00:59:00]  A lot of people are having the same problem, though.  Yeah, it was probably a little bug.  Maybe it was the Syrian, what are they called?  Oh, the Syrian fucking, those guys, the internet fucking hacker guys from Syria.  Yeah.  On Twitter, it's Opie Radio.  It's Anthony Cumia.  Ooh.  And it's Jim Norton.  We're Edgar Mellencamp.  Right.  That's it.  We all want more followers.  Of course we do. 
[00:59:30]  But somebody sent in the customer service meltdown.  I haven't heard this one yet.  We play these from time to time.  Yeah.  And this guy just loses, you liked it, right, Sam?  Yeah.  I listened to the first, like, three or four minutes of it.  It's a little long, but this guy speaks for all of us.  Yeah.  I just will not deal with customer service people anymore, because they read, well, God,  we've done this.  The flow chart.  The flow chart.  They're not listening to your individual problem.  They follow a system every single fucking time, and you beg them to get out of that flow 
[01:00:00]  chart shit and get right to the problem, and they just can't do it.  That's not their job, to get out of that flow chart.  Well, I think customer service is a complete waste of time in this day and age.  I really know.  Just buy a new one.  I hear about the customer service issues with our company, even.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, yeah.  I see the tweets.  Yeah, people don't like them.  But I don't know what to tell those people, because that's customer service, not just  for our company.  Everywhere.  I don't tell them anything.  Whenever I see questions on Twitter for me, I sincerely do go like, oh, I'll get back 
[01:00:30]  to that guy at some point.  Right.  And then they're just gone in the fucking mix.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I rarely answer people for serious questions.  Where have I had good customer service recently?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, the Apple people are great, you know, when you have an issue.  I do like a good Apple.  And they've changed how businesses, you know, handle customers, I think Apple has.  You notice that more and more places are a little more friendly, and I think that is 
[01:01:00]  because of the whole Apple culture, I really do.  You just want Americans, like when you're on the phone.  Americans.  Sounds crazy, but you just want someone who's, I don't care whether they're, if they speak  English, well, that's all I want.  Right.  Fairly informed.  Western Union, I tried using them, the worst.  They're simply the worst company I've ever done with.  What are you using Western Union for?  Well, I mean, yeah, exactly.  I fucking need a covered wagon.  I keep buying. 
[01:01:30]  Terrible.  And we all think we're getting somewhere by yelling at them.  They don't give a fuck.  They probably laugh.  They kind of chuckle.  They probably like, you know, start pointing to all the rest of the dummies in that office  going, hey, I got one.  Got one on the hook.  And they probably put you on speaker, and they probably just laugh at you that you're losing  your mind.  They don't give a fuck.  You're not getting through to them.  You know what gets them?  Threaten to take your business elsewhere.  Oh, that never works.  Because they don't care.  They don't give a fuck.  Why don't you care?  It's not my company.  Yeah, they're not even associated with the company. 
[01:02:00]  They're like some outsourced.  Yeah, they sell them out.  Yeah.  Right.  You might as well say, if you don't do this, I'll go to bed without supper.  I'll hold my breath.  I'm sure.  So, this one's labeled Customer Service Meltdown on YouTube.  I have not heard this one yet, so.  It's real?  Yeah.  I think so.  It sounds, I mean, it sounds real to me.  It's Jimmy Kimmel?  Does it sound like Jimmy Kimmel?  It's real to me, damn it.  It's still real to me.  We said on the air that we thought that was a fake video the day before he said it was 
[01:02:30]  his.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We, oh, we, we weren't fooled.  No, I was.  Were you?  No.  All right.  There's also, there's beeps in it.  I don't know where it's coming from.  I don't know why it's beeped, but just bear with the beeps.  Was that where the curses were?  Why is it beeped?  I don't know.  Or does he drop some N-bombs?  Fingers crossed.  Yeah.  Thank you for calling me. 
[01:03:00]  My name is Mark.  How are you doing today?  I am absolutely, I am, I am your worst nightmare.  Oh, okay.  I know this is, I know this is real because of that stammer at the beginning.  Yes, okay.  You can't fake that.  No, he's either a very good actor or, or this is absolutely real.  That, that little, he is so, that little stutter step, that, that says it all.  He's so livid here.  I am your worst nightmare.  He's already been through enough.  Right.  Like, this isn't just like, oh, I have a problem, I need to call, and this is the first 
[01:03:30]  time he's called, and he's obviously so angry already.  How about this one really fast?  So, you're dealing with customer service, and you're getting, you're actually getting  somewhere, and you're far along in the call.  Oh, yeah.  And then you get a drop call or something, and you go, oh, my God, I got to start over.  And then you get someone on, and you try to explain, no, we were just about at the solution.  Can I, can you find blah, blah?  Start over again.  And they start over again?  It's, it's always when they're, uh, they go, okay, um, please hold for a minute. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  Or they go, I'm going to transfer you over to this guy, and he'll take care.  Right.  And then you hear, like, and then it goes silent, there's no hold music, and you're  like, oh, no.  And then you just wait until, no.  Do you think that's a move they do?  Could be.  Yeah?  Could be.  Because there's no liability there, really.  Pull you off.  No, I was, I was, you know, I fucked up when I was trying to transfer the call.  Jess used to have to call customer service people for her job all the time, like airline 
[01:04:30]  people and stuff.  Uh-huh.  And I would always know when they hung up on her, because she'd be on the phone for,  like, 45 minutes.  Oh, no.  And she'd finally be getting someplace.  And then I'd just look across the room, and I'd see her screaming at the phone, fuck you!  Fuck you!  She should have, she should have, she should have yelled that when you opened that ring box in  front of her.  Beautiful ring, and we have a beautiful marriage.  Oh, wow.  That's nice. 
[01:05:00]  Wonderful.  Why don't we start over?  We'll try to shut up now, see?  Yeah, that's great.  I just love how the guy started.  How are you doing today?  I am absolutely, I am, I am your worst nightmare.  I am calling extension 3575 over and over and over and come over again to reach Michelle,  who said, to call her there.  She wants to talk to me.  She's been dealing with my situation for two days now.  And I've been on the phone for three hours trying to reach her.  And every time I call my number, I get your department. 
[01:05:30]  And none of you know what the fuck you're talking about.  What kind of a situation is this?  Yeah, I'm so sorry about that, sir.  Could I get the phone number in your account?  Why?  The last two people that asked for the phone number put me on hold and never fucking came  back.  So I would ask you why?  The reason I get your phone number is so that I can pull up your account and see any 
[01:06:00]  notes in the system.  I don't see what good the notes are going to do.  I need to be transferred to Michelle.  If there's no Michelle, then you people are going to get sued.  Not to mention, I might go ballistic and come over there with a machine gun.  Wow.  I don't have one, but I'll go fire one.  You don't do this to somebody.  You don't do this to somebody.  You didn't show up for your appointment today.  You didn't show up for your appointment today.  And now you won't talk to me?  That is f***ed up.  That is outrageous.  You're contracted to help me.  You have to. 
[01:06:30]  You have to.  What the f*** is going on?  Who is this Michelle and why is she telling me to call her knowing that I can't reach her?  And why does nobody there know who she is?  This is all f***ed up.  Yeah, I'm so sorry about that, sir.  Yeah, what I'd like to do is get your phone number so I can pull up your account.  This is f***ing, which is not supposed to be the f***ing number anymore.  I don't buy it.  No?  Nope.  No?  Jimmy's tapping out.  Don't buy it.  Tapping out.  I'll tell you what's bothering me is the voice of the customer service rep almost sounds 
[01:07:00]  like the guy.  It sounds like somebody putting out a voice.  Ooh.  What is your number, sir?  And no one tolerates that kind of screaming, fuck you, ah-ah.  That's true.  They all would go, sir, I understand you're upset, but.  Yeah, he's not even acknowledging how upset the guy is.  He's being cursed at immediately.  Maybe I understand, because just before you stopped, I was noticing something about the  voice, too.  Maybe that's, you think it's the same dude?  I was the same guy, but it sounds like a put, it doesn't sound like every other person. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  Listen again, the voice just doesn't sound right.  All right, let's keep listening.  All right.  I don't think I'm buying it either, though.  There was something else just, that just was said that got me.  And the beeps in a row sound like the fucking, the beeps in a row sound like a radio bit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Anyone claiming responsibility?  Too many beeps in a row.  Beep, beep, beep.  Beep, beep, beep.  Beep.  Ah, turd. 
[01:08:00]  Turd.  Call customer service, turd.  This would be the time a radio station would do something like this.  This was uploaded yesterday.  Yeah.  Which is when we all found out that Jimmy Kimmel had just done the fake thing.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  What, Penn Station?  That relates to the commuters. 
[01:08:30]  That fucking guy down there.  What is it?  The digity...  The digity...  Didgeridoo.  Didgeridoo.  A didgeridoo.  Didgeridoo.  What a useless fucking instrument.  Oh, I have a didgeridoo.  Dumb instrument.  I don't know, but it does have the...  If there's something over it, it sounds okay. 
[01:09:00]  Like, this alone sounds terrible.  Come down to the ad back and get a blaming onion.  A silver one stike.  Horrible.  This is a good sound if you're painting insanity.  It sounds like crazy.  But how do you know if this is a good...  Exactly.  A good song.  Yeah, this guy's rocking the digity.  How do you know?  Well, you can tell, right? 
[01:09:30]  Anyone else see the reading of the names yesterday?  I watched for about an hour.  I saw a little here.  Deeply depressing.  Holy fuck.  And they're giving the people time now to really talk.  Oh, to really go off.  And talk about their loved ones.  Oh, really?  In past years, it was like they would do a quick...  Just read names.  ...and, you know, especially for my uncle, blah, blah.  But now, man, they're giving all sorts of heartfelt messages.  It was brutal.  And then I was...  In my house, I was like, this is... 
[01:10:00]  I don't know.  It was downright depressing.  And everyone knows how sad it is, the reading of the names on 9-11.  I mean, no question about it.  And this is what I don't understand.  Then they have a flutist playing to make it even sadder.  I don't get that.  Flute music.  I'm not saying you play, like, some...  Benny Hill music.  Benny Hill music or anything.  But why do human beings need that?  Like, it's already sad, but let's really make sure it's even sadder.  Yeah.  The flutist was just, like, just playing that fucking flute shit that is just downright depressing. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, that's sad.  Why do we do that?  I don't know.  I don't like it either.  There was a lot of 9-11 stuff on yesterday.  A bunch of specials and documentaries and all kinds of shit.  I was just like, I gotta steer clear of that crap.  Fuck.  Gets me all...  I mean, believe me, I see enough to keep it ingrained in my head.  Of course.  Where I hate those people.  But, you know, as long as I can keep my hatred level up, I'm happy. 
[01:11:00]  And then, do you realize that because of this fucking bullshit with the budget that the FBI is furloughing their agents?  What's that mean?  They just give them days off.  They're not paid.  And they have to take days off.  And it's mandatory that they can't even...  If something happened, they couldn't show up to work.  They're liable for anything that happens.  If they get injured or something, they're not covered.  So they can't even show up if there is an emergency where they'd be needed. 
[01:11:30]  So they just...  Like, I think they're getting 14...  Each agent has to take 14 days a year off.  Like, um...  Unpaid.  Unpaid.  Yeah, yeah.  Because of, you know, the stupid budget constraints.  But we should give money to Egypt.  Right.  So just when you think, you know, we're safe and everything, it's that...  Why would you cut back on the...  But you've got to assume we have to give money to Egypt.  Because it's unbelievable that, you know, we would give them money all willy-nilly when we got these issues in America. 
[01:12:00]  I know.  So why do we have to give money to Egypt?  I don't know.  It's some deal that's been fucking made over the years.  What are we worried about if we don't give them the money?  That they're going to fucking start shit again with fucking Israel, I guess.  Right.  I don't know.  So we have to.  I think it's blackmail money.  It is.  It's a little crazy.  We should just go around like the fucking...  Like the world's fucking mafia.  Just strong-arm little countries.  Fuck you. 
[01:12:30]  Give it.  And not under the guise that we're helping anybody.  Just let's start rousting countries for their goods.  Let's go back to the customer service meltdown.  See, Jimmy...  We all think it's real.  Saying it's fake.  I am on the fence here.  I'll listen a little more.  The machine gun thing for me.  Oh my God.  That was a little...  Exactly.  And then carefully say, but I don't have one.  Yeah, that was a little weird.  Yeah.  That was the line that got me.  Yeah, that I was like, that doesn't seem real.  I'd listen to 30 seconds of it. 
[01:13:00]  It sounded real for the 30 seconds I'd listen to.  So that was...  Okay, let me just pull that up, sir.  Okay, yeah.  So can I get Michelle's extension again?  Three, five, seven, five.  And if you're going to transfer me there and have it put me back into the main system or the tech department, that is f***ed up.  Okay, yeah.  What I'd just like to do is transfer you to that extension. 
[01:13:30]  Would that be okay?  No, that would not be okay.  You don't think I'm capable of dialing that extension over and over again?  What the f*** is going on?  So you can either tell me a little bit about what's going on and I can try to help you or I can transfer you to that phone number.  Which would you prefer?  You can't f***ing tell that you can't help me and you can't f***ing tell that transferring me there doesn't do any good.  If you don't put me on the phone with somebody who can f***ing help me, f***ing tell me now, now, now, now, now. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, what I'd like to do is just get you to talk to a supervisor and maybe they can deal with that problem a little bit better, sir.  Would that be okay?  No, no, I've been through that loop three times already, goddammit.  I want you to explain to me right f***ing now why when I called the extension she told me to.  I always get put into the tech department and the tech department doesn't know anything about it.  How can you treat a customer that way? 
[01:14:30]  How many supervisors do you want me to speak to that can't help me?  Yeah, I'm so sorry, sir.  How many hours do you want me to stay on the phone?  I've been on the phone since six o'clock my time.  That's three and a half hours.  He's doing a good job, though.  The problem is, now that I've heard more of this, it's too vague.  It's very vague, right.  He's not talking about, he's never even mentioned what his problem is.  I have no idea what company, what he needs help with. 
[01:15:00]  He hasn't even, like in passing, mentioned why he's calling customer service.  Yeah, this is um...  Shit.  This is shit.  He's full of shite.  Fake, fake, fake.  Yeah?  Yes, fake.  Definitely.  I'm saying fake.  I say fake.  Then the votes are in. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  I bet it's a radio station.  It's probably a radio station.  It's trying to do the Jimmy Kimmel thing.  Is there...  Do the comments say fake, fake, totally fake, fake?  No, most of them don't.  There's a couple that do.  That say, like, this is too good to be real.  I think people are stupid.  I think the majority of people are dummies.  Because when you read the comments, a lot of times people really think, or they send  the link to you, you've got to hear this.  And you click on it and go, what are you, are you retarded?  Yeah.  It's fake, you fucking dummy.  Yeah.  I think people like thinking, like they want it to be real, so they... 
[01:16:00]  Right.  It's like those urban legends when people used to tell those, no, I swear, it was this  guy, that guy's cousin, I knew the guy.  It's like, no, you didn't.  My friends were on vacation years ago.  Uh-huh.  And the room got broken into.  Ooh.  And they, everything got taken except the toothbrush and the camera.  Oh, Jesus.  Really?  That's right.  I just found he also posted an interesting story like that, too.  Before that, I heard another story where a guy, they threw the toothbrush away, but 
[01:16:30]  the guy laid on the cabinet and just painted his dick like a toothbrush.  And the guy was just brushing his teeth with the guy's dick.  Yeah.  It's great.  Absolutely.  And then he kept, he had to squeeze the oniony bag of toothpaste.  This guy has another, um...  Well, it's the same way, he posted an unedited version.  Oh, unedited.  Why are we listening to this one?  Well, I just found the unedited version, obviously.  So go where we were. 
[01:17:00]  Go where we were.  And take up from where we left off.  Yeah, you piece of garbage.  Let's see if we hear him cursing.  The weirdness is that he...  I'm putting about to where we were.  Uh-huh.  But he apparently edited things for quote-unquote redundancy.  So the unedited version is two full minutes longer.  Mm-hmm.  Interesting.  Oh, Christ.  When are we...  It's weirdness.  Hear a little of it.  I want to hear without the beeps.  See if there's any more clues.  Put that little slink on the phone.  He supposedly knows who she is. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, what I'd like to do is get your phone number so I could pull up your account.  That's what?  Which is not supposed to be the goddamn fucking number anymore.  So that was...  Oh, the number.  Okay, let me just pull that up, sir.  And unless it was you, why would you edit out the fucking number?  Who cares?  And can I get the verbal password on the account, sir?  No, you may not.  I will pick that up with Michelle. 
[01:18:00]  Okay, yeah.  So can I get Michelle's extension again?  Three, five, seven, five.  And if you're going to transfer me there and have it put me back into the main system or the tech department, that is fucked up.  Okay, yeah, what I'd just like to do is transfer you to that extension.  Would that be okay?  No, that would not be okay.  You don't think I'm capable of dialing that extension over and over again?  She left me a fucking voicemail that said, call that extension.  If you don't reach me, dial 50-50, and one of the representatives will get you to me. 
[01:18:30]  But the representatives have no fucking clue what the fuck is going on.  This guy would not stand.  I'm out.  You can either tell me a little bit about what's going on, and I can try to help you, or I can translate to that phone number.  Which would you prefer?  You can't fucking tell that you can't help me, and you can't fucking tell that transferring me there doesn't do any good.  It's too vague.  If you don't put me on the phone.  I still don't know what the fucking problem is, or what company's calling.  What's the fucking problem?  What's the issue?  Did he buy a hat that's brimless, and it falls off? 
[01:19:00]  It was a brimless hat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did he buy balls that have no sides?  Yeah.  Did it look like plates?  All right.  Are you rock fake or real?  Well, you know a bit about radio.  Sounds fake.  Sounds fake.  No parody songs yet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They just did a phone scam, but no parodies yet. 
[01:19:30]  Phone scam?  I bet it was real, right?  I believe so.  What kind of phone scam?  I don't know.  It's saving down right now.  I'll find out when we go to break.  Ooh.  They're so fake.  And poorly edited.  You want to take our chances with another suggestion?  I do.  Okay.  Phone scam.  No, no.  I mean, Matt in New York.  He wants us to listen to something else.  Matt.  Great.

[01:47:00]  oh  Very, very cool.  Listen to the words, man.  All right.  The good news, Tom on Long Island is still out there. 
[01:47:30]  He has a chance.  He's still on the line.  An excited guy.  Can Jim repeat numbers?  Are people replacing those phone banks?  Yeah, but I'm just trying to mix it up.  Oh, yeah, I can't repeat numbers.  No, I would say no.  Okay.  So two and six are out, right?  Yes.  Two and six?  Two and six.  But they should stay on the line because we might give away another pair and then we'll  start over.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  So it's between one and nine.  You can't say.  Wow.  All right.  One.  Yeah, that's not excited, Tom. 
[01:48:00]  Let's say hi to Steve in Pennsylvania.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Got a chance to see Metallica live at the Apollo a week from Saturday.  Yes, sir.  Can you get there on your own?  Yes, I can.  Don't blow it, fucko.  I say we go to the next song.  Okay.  All right.  So Roland's going to recite some lyrics.  All you have to do is figure out what Metallica song.  All right.  As I watch death unfold, consciousness, my only friend, my fingers grip with fear. 
[01:48:30]  What am I doing here?  Flashing before my eyes.  Now it's time to die.  Burning in my brain.  Can I feel the flame?  Ah!  You got 15 seconds.  I almost sound like you went to a sanitarium there again, but you just did that, probably.  Yeah.  You got like five seconds.  We need a guess.  Happy birthday, Jim Norton.  That's it.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  This is amazing.  Wow. 
[01:49:00]  You're going to see a great concert.  Oh, boy.  He takes such pleasure.  Giggle.  Giggle 7th again.  Play it, Yorick.  I was riding lightning.  Oh, yeah.  Someone else gets rolling me.  Wept in the air.  Wept in the air.  Wept in the air.  Wept in the air.  Wept in the air.  Wept in the air.  Sounds just like Roland singing it.  I don't know how.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I'm got to say.  Oh, she's going to love to you.  You've asked me for my eyes. 
[01:49:30]  Now it's time to die.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Burning in my brain.  I can feel free.  Wow.  It sounded different when they sang it.  It's a little different than how Roland did it.  Roland, really?  I like Roland's interpretation of Metallica's song.  It's good stuff. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  So now we go back to the phones.  I'm going to get more songs.  Huh?  I'm going to need to get more songs.  Yeah.  Right?  Tom on Long Island, the very excited guy, is still out there.  He has a chance still.  Jimmy, pick a number between one and nine.  You can't say one, two, or six.  Oh.  Can I say something higher than six?  What do you mean?  I can say a number higher than six, though, right?  Sure.  Nine.  Okay.  Five!  Five!  Five!  Oh! 
[01:50:30]  It's going to go higher than six.  Look who it is.  Let's see who it is.  Number five.  Hi, number five.  Who's this?  Hey!  We got to you, Tom.  Oh, okay.  Holy shit.  You got a chance for real now.  Tom on Long Island.  Very excited to see Metallica.  0 for 3, Tom.  0 for 3.  Think about that.  All right.  Good luck to you, Tom.  All right.  Thank you.  Are you really a Metallica fan, or are you doing a bit? 
[01:51:00]  I want to see Metallica!  I want to see Metallica.  Yeah.  All right.  Which one are we doing?  Right in this one?  The next one.  All right.  Roland's going to recite some lyrics here.  All you have to do is name the song.  You get to see Metallica at the Beacon Theater.  Beacon?  Beacon or Apollo?  No.  Sorry.  Sorry.  The Apollo.  Jesus.  I want to say the Apollo concert, not the Beacon concert.  Sorry.  Sorry.  The Apollo show.  Yes.  Yes.  Do you take what I take?  Endurance is a word.  Moving back instead of forward. 
[01:51:30]  Seems to me absurd.  Woo!  15 seconds.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Is he done?  Yeah.  What did he say?  He said...  Endurance is a real answer.  Go.  Yes.  What?  What?  What?  Endurance fan, man.  No.  No!  Big fan, my ass.  Enjoy.  Stay at home on the 21st. 
[01:52:00]  Eye of the Beholder.  I cannot believe not one person has won this yet.  Wow.  All right.  We move on.  Yeah.  Stay on the line, though.  Stay on the line.  So now you can't pick five.  Oh, Tom.  So, number between one and nine, but you can't pick one, two, five, or six, Jim Norton.  13 is no good, so how about three plus one is four? 
[01:52:30]  All right.  We're going to go with four.  We got Steve in New York.  Steve, you got a chance to see Metallica at the Apollo a week from Saturday.  What's going on, guys?  Good luck to you, Steve.  Thank you.  Remember, 0 for 4.  That's when we're going to the top of the second page.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Listen to Roland.  All you have to do is name the song, and you're going to go see Metallica at the Apollo.  Pure black, lucky clear.  My work is done soon here.  Trying to get back to me?  Get back where she used to be. 
[01:53:00]  Drink up.  Shoot in.  Let the beaties begin.  Distribute the pain.  Your loss becomes my gain.  Woo.  15 seconds.  Steve?  Oh, my God.  One?  One.  No, it's not one.  No, it's not one.  Wow.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, man.  Shit, Steve. 
[01:53:30]  Harvester of Sorrow.  It's exactly like a Roland's version.  I wish we had it cued up to the part, but we can't.  It's hard to do.  I feel you take this life that I forsake.  Been cheated of my youth.  You've done this life to true.  You like Metallica, Sam? 
[01:54:00]  I do.  I don't see any bugging James Hetfield tats on you.  Yeah.  I don't love Metallica.  I like Metallica.  Oh, that's different.  All right, let's move on.  Jack White, with all my heart.  Let's see.  Fact.  At this point, you can pick either 3, 7, 8, or 9.  9!  9, please.  Let's say hi to Dale in New Jersey.  Dale, good luck.  You got a chance to see Metallica a week from Saturday at the Apollo Theater.  My old partner. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, my shit.  Dale.  I get it.  Find your peace.  Find your say.  Find the smooth road to eat your way.  Trust you gave a child to save.  Let you call and him in grief.  Ah!  He's getting a lot of the words wrong, which makes it hard, too.  Jesus.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, Dale.  Good luck to you.  Did I ride the lightning?  What?  What? 
[01:55:00]  What?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Music.  Loser.  No.  I'm sorry, Dale.  All right.  All right.  Mark.  I thought we would have a winner by now.  Absolutely.  I thought nine songs were going to be plenty to get.  Exactly.  Yeah.  The God That Failed.  All right.  What number was that?  Nine?  Yeah.  Now it's either three, seven, or eight.  These are hard, though.  Like, Roland couldn't get one. 
[01:55:30]  If I would do it, like, if it was a Bruce Springman, I would say, like, a...  Bruce Springman.  So, uh, born in the blank.  Go.  You got four hours.  Four.  What a horrible contest.  All right.  Three, seven, or eight.  Oh, cool.  Trying to give away these Metallica tickets.  Well, obviously, seven's hungry because it ate.  Oh, all right.  I'm going to still be hungry.  Paul.  Ah.  Hello.  Paul, on Long Island, you got a chance to see Metallica a week from Saturday at the Apollo 
[01:56:00]  Theater.  Metallica.  I sell, Paul.  You just got to come up with the name of the song that, uh, Roland is reciting the lyrics  from.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Here we go.  Roland, to you.  Left home at an early age of what I heard was wrong.  I never asked for forgiveness, but what he said is done.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  This is the worst contest.  Travis actually has to go find more songs. 
[01:56:30]  I'm just going to say sad but true.  Oh, no.  Liza.  Oh, my God.  Why do you take pleasure in this, Roland?  It makes me laugh.  Mama said.  Roland, you're the worst.  Well, you're not going to go to Metallica.  What an asshole.  He really is rubbing it in.  You like that Roland's rubbing it in?  All right.  Paul's gone.  He's not happy.  I don't know who to bring with me to this.  Oh.  You got excited to talk.  Do I bring a good buddy? 
[01:57:00]  Or do I bring something with a cunt?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Three or seven, Jim Norton.  Three.  Uh-oh.  We know that both will get a chance, though.  Wait a minute.  Now we got a path not found thing popping up on the screen.  I just hit okay.  You sure?  Yeah.  What happened?  His bones just got zapped.  His bones went away.  God damn it, man.  We can't fucking have this during a contest.  No.  Who cares? 
[01:57:30]  I don't know.  It's just frustrating.  Oh, wow.  Wait, wait.  No, we got new people.  New people now.  Yay.  I think we got a whole bunch.  What's number three?  Looky, looky, Miss Cookie.  All right.  We got all new people.  Do we?  Yes, we do.  We'll go to number three.  Okay.  Oh, no, we don't, because this guy's been there for 20 minutes.  Okay, so get him.  I just don't know who it is.  Who are you, sir?  It's Kenny.  Hey, Kenny.  Where are you calling from?  Washington.  How long have you been on hold?  Ah, let's see.  He drove through D.C.  Okay, wow.  Okay, okay.  All right, so you've been on hold for a while. 
[01:58:00]  You're in Washington, D.C.  You could get to the Apollo a week from Saturday if you win?  Hell, yeah.  Okay.  All you have to do is name the song.  Oh, I know.  I know.  If they say, death, won't you let me stay?  If they say, death, hear me call your name?  Oh, call your name.  Ah!  What the hell is that?  That's Metallica, dude.  That's Metallica, dude. 
[01:58:30]  All right, we need an answer.  Oh, jeez.  The Unforgiven.  What the hell is that?  You suck, Roland.  You suck, Roland.  Oh, well.  I love this song.  Cyanide.  What?  This album looks so fucking heavy.  Did Rick Wolfen do this?  I think he did.  I don't know.  Oh, this is the rolling part. 
[01:59:00]  All right, he did it a little different.  Okay.  We're down to the last caller that's been on hold, at least, and then we might have to just  start over.  We will, but we'll do it a different way. 
[01:59:30]  Line seven.  Who is this?  This is Kevin from Philly.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  Hi there.  Hi there.  Hi there, Kevin.  Good luck to you.  You got a chance to see Metallica, Apollo Theater, week from Saturday.  All you have to do is figure out what song Roland is reciting lyrics from.  This is the face that stones you cold.  This is the moment that needs to breathe.  These are the claws that scratch the wounds.  This is the pain that never leaves.  This is the tongue that wipes you down.  Ah!  Uh, this thing that should not be? 
[02:00:00]  Ah!  No.  It just goes no.  Oh, God.  You're crushing people's dreams out there today, Roland.  Really are, Roland.  Can we hear a sick fucking puppies remix of that?  Fuck yeah.  Fuck.  Sick fucking puppies.  That was some kind of monster.  Son of a bitch.  He rocked some kind of monster.  I don't have that one queued up there. 
[02:00:30]  I didn't tell him I was out getting out of here.  I did.  We have the live version.  No, I don't have the vocals queued up.  We have the live version.  Yeah.  I am amazed that we haven't given away one fucking ticket.  Good idea.  No.  I thought this would be four and nine.  This is amazing.  That's what I thought.  Now, I wanted to, here's how I wanted to do this.  The next one.  You want to change up the contest?  I want to pick randomly out of the thing because I've already gone to these numbers. 
[02:01:00]  So, I don't want to know who's, I wanted to be, that was random because I didn't, but  now I've listened to all these guys once and I want it to be totally fair.  It's all new people, isn't it?  No, it's the same people.  We kept one home.  No, well now, like the people that replaced the ones that lost.  Oh, I thought they stayed on.  Oh, no, they're gone.  Yeah, it's new people on the same phone.  It's now, you got nine brand new people now officially.  Oh, I didn't realize.  So, now you can go back to, you know, picking between one and nine.  We start all over.  All new people. 
[02:01:30]  All those people had a chance, they're gone.  Yep.  Can't Tom.  He's making fun of Tom again.  Yeah.  I just keep thinking eight.  I just keep thinking eight.  Eight.  Okay.  All right.  I don't even know his name yet.  Let's see.  There's a powerful alert.  Why is it all taking so long to get the people's name?  We're seeing them all in here.  Yeah.  It's weird.  Oh, no.  I only got two that I can see.  Yeah.  For some reason, it doesn't transfer.  All right.  Number eight.  Who are you?  And where are you calling from?  Doug?  Hi, Doug. 
[02:02:00]  Doug, what's up, buddy?  Connecticut?  Yeah.  What are you?  A hole or something?  Get kidding you, Dougie.  All right.  Doug from Connecticut.  I'm doomed with this contest.  Let's give it a shot anyway.  All right.  Roland, to you.  With hell in my eyes and death in my veins, the indisclusive men, feeding on my minds  of men, and from their souls within, my disciples will all shout, search out!  Ah!  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  You got like half the words wrong.  I know.  Oh, gosh.  Wait.  I want to get one more try, Roland. 
[02:02:30]  With hell in my eyes, with death in my veins, the indisclusive men, feeding on the minds  of men, and from their souls within, my disciples all shout to search out!  I don't know.  Unforgiven.  I'm wrong.  Oh.  Sorry, Dougie.  But you should do this.  Jump in the file.  Jump in the file.  All right. 
[02:03:00]  Didn't get it.  All right.  Let's move on here.  We just want to give a...  We have four pairs.  We thought we'd give away at least two by now.  Jimmy, what number?  Can't pick eight.  I know.  I can't pick eight, so I can pick probably a two.  Two?  All right.  Who is this, and where are you calling from?  Hello.  Hey, you.  Everyone say hi.  No.  Hello?  Sit.  Goodbye.  Turd.  All right.  Two's gone.  Turd. 
[02:03:30]  Two gone.  Which one do we do?  Eight and two?  Well, let's just fucking split the difference and go with five.  Oh, five.  Let's go to five.  Dude, no.  Hi, who's this?  Edgar.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  That's you.  Yeah.  What's your name, brother?  Hey, Rob.  How are you calling from, Rob?  Where are you stealing?  New Jersey.  All right.  Rob in New Jersey.  Good luck to you, buddy.  Thanks, man.  Okay.  Rolling.  Rolling.  Crystal lines as I lay here and rest.  Eyes of glass stare directly at death.  From deep sleep, I broke in the way. 
[02:04:00]  No one knows.  No one hears what I say.  Ah!  It's always the exasperation.  Yeah.  But you know you're going to get a real Metallica fan to figure this shit out.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  I'll give you a clue.  It's a Metallica song.  They know that.  Trapped under ice.  Asshole.  I think this guy's good with the Google. 
[02:04:30]  Could be.  Are you good at the Google?  No way, man.  No way, dude.  I'm the hugest fan.  I'm in my fucking car.  So fired up.  Please tell me.  Didn't sound like it.  You're not in a car, though.  Beep your horn.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Okay.  That wasn't a real beep, Rob.  I just want to know, and it's okay.  It really is.  Did you Google?  Absolutely not, man.  I swear to God.  Yeah, it's hard for them to Google that fast.  Trapped under ice.  It is, Rob.  Yes.  We got a winner. 
[02:05:00]  We got our first winner to see Metallica a week from Saturday at the Apollo Theater.  Psychotic McKinney, Rob.  Trapped under ice.  It is, Rob.  Congratulations.  You win permission to stand outside the Apollo Theater and listen.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, man.  Congratulations.  Turn down the music so we can hear how excited Rob is.  Yes.  Listen to him.  Oh, my God.  Wow, this is crazy.  Right, Rob?  Oh, man.  I'm jacked up, man.  All right.  Well, hold on, I guess. 
[02:05:30]  Yes.  Hold on, Rob.  You're going to go see Metallica.  I'm going to put you on hold.  I've got to do this very carefully.  And you're going to talk to a real stupid person who will take your info.  That's right.  Rob, on line five, one of the Metallica tickets.  Yeah.  Sal.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Dummy.  Sal has picked him up already.  That's the guy you're talking about?  Yeah, Sal.  We have four more songs.  You want to just get through them?  We do have four more?  Yeah, I have three more in my hand.  How long is this going to take, though?  Yeah, let's try to get one more winner.  Yeah.  So what numbers did we do so far? 
[02:06:00]  Eight, two, and five.  I'll tell you what we didn't do.  Okay.  Nine.  Nine.  Nine.  Nine.  Trying to give away another pair here before we go to break.  Who's this?  Hello.  Hi, nine.  Hi, nine.  That's you.  Who are you?  Sir?  John from Orange County.  John from Orange County.  Are you ready to try to decipher what Roland is saying to win Metallica tickets?  Will you be able to get to the show?  I'll try. 
[02:06:30]  He sounds like he's got something in his mouth.  No, but if you win the tickets, will you be able to go to the show?  Yeah, absolutely.  What's that background noise?  Where are you calling from?  Work.  What do you do for work?  I sell auto parts.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  What do you sell, a bunch of roofs?  A bunch of carburetors.  All right, ready?  Yeah.  And now you're going to have only 15 seconds, so.  Okay.  Because I know some of the people are trying to Google their asses off.  We got to fucking do this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Knowing that Google is in play.  All right, Roland.  Let's go.  For John.  Fearless wretch.  In sanity, he watches.  Lurking beneath the sea.  Timeless sleep.  He's been upset.  He awakens.  15 seconds.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  That was not me.  Oh, God.  Was that Roland?  Can you do it?  Can you say it again?  No.  No.  We need an answer right now. 
[02:07:30]  Come on.  That's it.  We need an answer, brother.  Wretch.  No, Roland is one.  I'm sorry, John.  The thing.  That should not be.  That was terrible.  That was Roland?  Yes.  He did it right before he started reading.  Oh, fuck.  He made it over here.  That was a fucking meat fart. 
[02:08:00]  What the fuck did you eat, Roland?  That was a foodie fart.  I had a protein shake.  Yuck.  That's another word for a fucking tank of load.  I need the Lysol for real.  No, you don't.  Well, come on.  Man up.  Enjoy it.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, you're fucking spurled meat fart.  I'm going to choke on his beard.  Are you happy?  He's in very poor health.  Are you happy?  Exactly.  The fucking pot roast gasser.  Oh, God.  That's so bad. 
[02:08:30]  Write that like me.  No, it's bad.  Jimmy could push out anything at this point, and we will accept it, because we're just used  to the smell itself.  Wow.  When you get a new one, a new fucking fart.  That's horrendous.  Whoa.  Pretty bad.  All right.  All right.  Let's try to give away another pair.  Do you want more after these three, or we...  No, no.  Then we'll have to figure out something else.  Jimmy...  Wow.  Yeah, it's lingering.  Sour.  Yeah, which ones did we do already, O? 
[02:09:00]  8, 2, 5, 9.  We didn't do one.  All right.  We didn't do one.  Line one.  Who is this, and where are you calling from?  Josh from Philadelphia.  All right, Josh.  Good luck to you.  All you have to do is figure out what...  Where are you really from?  She's joshing.  Just got to figure out what song Roland is reciting from Metallica.  Barking of machine fire...  Oh, sorry.  Ah!  Barking of machine gun fire...  Does nothing to me now...  Sounds of clock...  That ticks...  Get used to... 
[02:09:30]  Get used to it somehow...  More a man...  More stripes you wear...  Glory's secret trends...  Eh.  You got 15 seconds.  Uh...  Uh...  I don't know.  My wife's favorite song, Disposable Heroes.  Did you Google?  No.  It's okay if you Google.  I don't care.  I just need to know.  I'm driving at work.  All right, Josh.  I'll get your horn.  I'll get your horn.  Holy fuck.  We got a winner, Josh. 
[02:10:00]  You're going to go see Metallica a week from Saturday at the Apollo Theater.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Yes, it was Disposable Heroes.  That's my wife's favorite song.  Is it really?  Yeah, the role is terrible at singing it.  Well, of course.  It's terrible at everything.  It makes it hard.  All right.  I thought there would be more excitement.  Yeah, we're opening for them.  Why is it when other shows give away shit, the excitement is just all...  Oh, the excitement.  The hook.  They're fucking going crazy. 
[02:10:30]  We're four hours into a fucking stroke victim.  Even the winners are like, I just want to go home.  Yes.  Oh, we get it.  All right, Josh, hold on the line, all right?  You're going to go see Metallica.  He's joshing.  All right, brother.  Congratulations.  We're going to have two more pairs to give away, I guess, tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck that.  We'll try another contest.  Something with Roland, though.  It has to be with Roland.  I like what he was doing.  That was fucking good, man.  Roland, you bummed it.  You actually... 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, honestly, I was wrong.  I'm happy.  I thought it was hurting.  You want something for that?  He'll come.  He'll come.  He'll come.  He knows.  Roland is a drill.  He asks for a cold ease.  I don't have one.  He lays his head on a pillow, gets his mouth fucked.  I say yes to a guest.  And I say...  Fool me once?  Shame on me.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  I don't know.  Fool me once.  I don't know what that meant. 
[02:11:30]  I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  Okay, that's it for today's Metallica contest.  Nice.  Contest.  Gave away a couple of...  Is that a pair of tickets for each one?  Yes.  Wow.  Yes, shut up!  Oh, what did I do?  Yay, the Rolls.  The Rolls.  Kevin Pollock on the way?  So what?  Oh, yeah.  And then Jim's calling in after.  So what?  What happened to the Jim Jeffries call?  Uh, because as soon as we're here, I said, we'll call you after the break. 
[02:12:00]  Shut up.  So what?  We'll call you after.  I call it after the break.  Oh.  So what?  Edgar, you're so mean.  Yeah, Edgar, Jesus.  And you're not invited.  What the fuck are you here?  How does Edgar get in here?  Just go away.  I like the Doobie Brothers.  Oh, God.  You like the Doobies?  Which one?  Edgar Winner.  Oh, yeah?  That's him?  Sounds great.  Should I plug something?  Please.  October 10th and 11th, I'll be in the Doylestown Comedy Cabaret. 
[02:12:30]  Tickets are only 15 bucks because I'm working on material.  Oh.  And, yeah, it's fun.  I love this process.  I liked when you did it last year.  You hit a bunch of areas you usually don't go to.  You keep the ticket nice and cheap.  It's awesome.  And this is working on stuff, so I'll be fine.  But it's not, you got to tell the people it's more than working on stuff.  They're going to have an amazing time.  You know, I probably got 35 to 40 minutes of material that I'm really happy with.  You're going to hear 40 minutes of material that will definitely be on Jimmy's next special.  Yeah, that's what I'm working on for.  And then some greatest hits, probably, and some crowd work. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  It's a great show.  Great opportunity to see Jimmy on the cheap.  So it's Doylestown PA Comedy Cabaret.  It's been there for years.  It's a great club.  Okay, good.  Very cool.  And I guess when we get back, we'll talk to Jim Jeffries, and we'll also have Kevin Pollock in studio.  Nice.  So what?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  See, told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to The O.P. and Anthony Show.  A child arrived just the other day. 
[02:13:30]  He came to the world in the usual way.  But there were planes to catch and bills to pay.  He learned to walk while I was away.  And he was talking before I knew it.  And as he grew, he'd say, I'm gonna be like you, Dad.  You know I'm gonna be like you.  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon. 
[02:14:00]  Little boy blue and the man in the moon.  When you're coming home, Dad, I don't know when.  But we'll get together then.  You know we'll have a good time then.  My son turned in just the other day.  He said, thanks for the ball, Dad.  Come on, let's play.  Can you teach me to throw?  I said, no.  All your Harry Chapin cover?  I don't mind when Harry Chapin's done it.  But, you know. 
[02:14:30]  But his smile never did it.  I'm gonna be like him.  He did a great job with this song.  He should have done a Metallica song.  Oh.  He would have.  I know he would have.  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.  And my head's in the road.  Little boy blue and the man in the moon.  When you're coming home, Dad, I don't know when.  But we'll get together then.  You know we'll have a good time then.  You think Johnny Cash Day's a hit, Ant?  No.  It's not a hit. 
[02:15:00]  The other day.  The man I just had to say.  I'm so proud of you.  Can you sit for a while?  Wow.  I didn't mind the Johnny Cash episode of Columbo.  But that's about all I can do for Johnny Cash, really.  See you later.  Gonna have them please.  Have them please.  Our pal Jim Jeffries is on the phone.  Ah.  Good morning, Mr. Jeffries.  Good morning.  How are you?  All right.  I gotta apologize for that text over the weekend.  My buddies were down there in Philly. 
[02:15:30]  We were going to see Dave Chappelle.  Uh-huh.  And I guess Jim Jeffries is doing some of the dates.  So I finally, I called in a favor.  I wrote Jim because my guys were sitting on the lawn.  I go, I write Jim.  I'm like, hey man, you know, my guys have seen you tonight.  Can you maybe, you know, help me out with getting them better seats?  And he just writes back, what show are we talking about, mate?  He wasn't with Chappelle in Philly.  So then I felt like a complete asshole. 
[02:16:00]  Well, you should.  But I guess you're doing some Chappelle dates on the West Coast?  I'm starting Sunday and then I'm doing, I think I'm doing Arizona, Irvine, Vegas, and San Francisco.  They put me on the poster for all the dates.  There's like 15 shows, so I get abused every fucking day because someone's like, yeah, dude, the only reason I came to see the show in Austin is because I'm like, sorry.  It's not your fault. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, that's not cool.  You didn't make up the posters.  Yeah, because now you look like an asshole, like you're canceling shows or whatever.  Yeah, I look like I'm just not showing up.  But I am, I'm showing up to the ones I'm meant to be doing.  But I'm a little bit nervous about them.  They're like 30,000 seat gigs.  I can't see it going well.  Yeah, and there's been a little controversy with Chappelle.  Oh, he's back on track.  Yeah, he is.  He had a little.  Controversy.  You just had a bad gig.  I did it like weekly.  Like I'm in a club where I go, well, you could all fuck off then. 
[02:17:00]  And I saw him all.  It sounded like the people were fucking being assholes though.  No, no.  Blurting out shit from the old show.  Jim, I want to talk.  With 30,000 people, it's not like you can go, oh, that's like the tech link over there.  Get him out of here.  Right.  That's true.  I want to talk to you about a tweet yesterday.  Yeah, what's that?  Well, you were talking about babysitting your kids.  I got told that's your idea, but worse than that.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I'm not going there at all. 
[02:17:30]  Of course not.  That's not why I'm bringing it up.  I'm bringing it up because I have talked about it on the show, and I can completely relate.  And it drives people nuts when you say it.  From time to time, I go, I had to babysit my kids last night.  And they're like, if they're your kids, you're not babysitting.  But the reality is there are times where you're absolutely just babysitting.  You're just fucking making sure they're not killing themselves.  And then there's a lot of times where, yeah, you're doing fatherly things with them.  Yeah, it's just suicide watch for the most part. 
[02:18:00]  I don't know if there's parenting involved.  My kid's first word yesterday, no.  No?  No.  Yeah.  You think most people say dad or mom or anything?  Yeah, right.  His first word, no.  So pedophiles beware.  That's right.  You know?  Isn't that like kind of a telling thing if your kid says no first?  I think he probably assumes that's my name because he hears his mother say it to me so much. 
[02:18:30]  How's it going?  You're almost a year in, I think.  I'm 10 months in, yeah.  It's all right.  Yeah, it's good.  Yeah.  He's a good little fella.  Right.  He did a modeling job for baby Bjorn Carriers.  Really?  The other day.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  Getting him right in the business.  You're getting him right in.  Yeah.  Well, so now he's officially earned more money than his mother this year.  Around 10 months, my daughter's going to be a year very soon. 
[02:19:00]  I mean, it's starting to finally become cool.  Before that, it's just like...  They're just fucking organisms.  They're just kind of blobs.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, that's...  Yeah, he's all right.  He sort of...  He does the thing when he walks around holding the coffee table and stuff.  He gets so excited by the shit that only people with kids can understand.  Oh, he just ate a grape.  There's no excitement there, and I'll tell you why.  Because now the diaper changing, Anthony... 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  When you start introducing foods into their little bodies there...  Yeah, yeah.  Now you get the big shits.  The diaper thing was easy.  But now, because we introduced the food about a month ago, they're a complete nightmare.  It's brutal.  Well, I could have...  Oh, I inspect this shit like a German.  You know?  I'm in there going, we can't give him seeds anymore.  They go straight through him.  The other day, we gave him pumpkin seeds, and I think he's arsehole's the diameter of a nickel. 
[02:20:00]  You know what I mean?  I'm like, he can't have a fucking pumpkin seed.  That's got to really tear through his colon.  Oh, shit.  That doesn't sound very good for a small child.  No, and then the shit goes all the way up their back, halfway, almost up to their belly button in the front.  Like, what the...  They've got to figure out that diaper thing a little better, I think.  I don't know.  Parents don't seem to care that their kids are fucking packed with shit and wiping it off and not gagging. 
[02:20:30]  And I'm cleaning out vaginas now.  Oh, man.  That is the weirdest thing.  Yeah, so you got that, you have to wipe away from the cunt, don't you?  You got to, like, you got to spread a little bit, and then you got to get in there.  Jesus Christ.  It's the weirdest thing ever.  This is the weird thing, right?  Because my...  You go, what?  Because it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunt.  But, like...  But, like, like, man, I don't...  You know, like, my kid can have shit all over his balls.  Not a problem.  Happy you, Larry. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even to this day, if you fuck a girl on the ass, and you got shit on your dick, you'll call your friend up and tell him.  You'll go, I had shit all over my dick the other night.  And then he'll tell you a story about when he had shit on his dick.  And you'll both laugh.  But in the history of women, there's never been, like, someone go, Karen, you'll never guess what happened to me.  Right.  I had shit in my cunt.  Oh, that's great.  You really got to, like, open it up and fuck it down. 
[02:21:30]  You got to get in there, man.  This seems weird.  Like, a mom should do that.  Well, it is a little wild.  There should be some type of, like, sort of...  I don't know if you have to open up, like, some type of stick with a hook on the end to scoop it out.  That's something you could take on Shark Tank.  Right.  Yeah, you could take on Shark Tank.  I haven't...  I don't mind the diapers.  It's not...  I mean, when your kid starts taking man shits, though, that's a little fucked up.  That's when I'm like, okay, we're done here.  It's time to get on the fucking toilet. 
[02:22:00]  I prefer the man shit because it's solid.  And it's just one sort of just...  It's amazing.  You're like, that came out of this little thing?  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing sometimes.  But whatever.  Jim, what are we promoting today, buddy?  We're promoting Carnegie Hall November 9th.  How cool is that?  Our pal Jim Jeffress is playing fucking Carnegie Hall.  Are you serious?  Yeah, yeah.  So, but we've got to move some tickets.  There's only on sale for about a week or so.  But, yeah, I'm doing Carnegie Hall. 
[02:22:30]  We close out the New York Comedy Festival.  So, you know, it's one of those weird things that you hear about that the whole...  I rang my dad up and said...  Actually, I was in Sydney when I found out when they booked me.  And I said, Dad, I'd like to fly you out.  I'm going to be performing in Carnegie Hall.  And my dad went, I saw your show last night.  And I went, well, yeah, but this is going to be Carnegie Hall.  And he went, is it going to be the same jokes? 
[02:23:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Not quite getting the gist of the whole Carnegie Hall thing.  Parents have a way of...  No, in Australia, you didn't quite get it.  Parents have a way of just bringing you right back down to earth, man.  And used to tell a story with his mom and how she, like, would talk about our radio show.  We would be just fucking kicking ass.  And how would she...  It just seemed like it was a hobby.  And, like, when am I going to get back to work?  Right. 
[02:23:30]  And she'd go, oh, you're talking with your friends again today?  Your friends on your...  How was your little show?  Right.  The little show.  Right.  Holy shit.  I'm not going back to construction.  Right.  She just thought it was, like, a little side job.  Yeah, yeah.  You get it out of my system.  Before you got back to work.  Right.  Get that out of my system so I can get back to construction work.  Like, real work.  And, yeah.  And really, you know, have a career.  That's why he used to be a carpenter for so long.  So he had something to fall back onto, right?  Right. 
[02:24:00]  Yes.  Yes.  It's always...  Oh, God, they were always with the fall back thing.  You know, no, we don't want to get in the way of your dreams.  We know you want to do this and stuff.  But you really need a trade to fall back on.  Well, that's good.  Yeah.  The fucking safety net of shit.  Someone argued that you really should have no safety net.  And that's when you become successful.  That's when you have to make it work.  Who talked about recently having your back against the cliff?  Like, literally, you can't fall back on anything because you're going to fucking...  You know, you're going to die. 
[02:24:30]  You're going to fall.  Yeah, you can have a safety.  Some would say you can have a safety if you really want to make it.  I don't know.  Fucking Carnegie Hall, man.  That's crazy.  I didn't know you played an instrument there, Jim Jeffries.  Yeah, you look on the webpage and it's like the only two acts that are doing it are me  and Kathy Griffin.  So I'm shameless.  I go on the webpage and I go, I wonder how many tickets she's sold.  You know, I want to check out all the empty seats she's got and so forth.  And then I'm on the webpage and I go, I wonder how much this cello cunt is sold, right? 
[02:25:00]  This cello cunt.  The cello cunt.  The cello cunt.  And he's like going weeks after, and I go, the cello cunt sold us.  He must be really funny.  If it's billed that way, man, I would go see it.  Yes.  Cello cunt.  I will absolutely go to the Carnegie Hall show to see Jim Jeffries.  I think that's an amazing accomplishment.  Saturday, November 9th, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Tickets on sale now for Carnegie Hall. 
[02:25:30]  And I think we might even be filming a little tiny bit of it for legit,  because we're going to be right smack in the middle of filming season two when that happens.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, second season.  Congratulations on that.  Yeah, we start that next week.  We're filming in a water park, but the problem is we're still trying to cast my dad.  And it's gotten a bit tricky to find an elderly Australian man who's funny. 
[02:26:00]  But we'll see how it goes.  We want Paul Hogan.  And we've been trying, and we still haven't gotten an answer back yet.  I don't know if I'm meant to say anything, but fuck it.  What the difference is going to make you go and say no?  What the fuck is Paul Hogan doing?  Well, this is what I think.  Right.  What else is he doing that he can't do your show?  What the hell's wrong with this guy?  No one's seen him in a while.  Right.  Right?  Well, I just don't think he needs to work.  I think he's just happy as he is.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, but that would be a cool gig.  The show's hot.  People are talking about it.  He can be your dad.  That's cool.  Yeah, I think so.  I'd like to just hang out with him for a while.  You know what I mean?  You know, have him and John Ratzenberg scene.  That's all I wanted.  Right.  It's not too much to ask.  But then we've also got to cast a morbidly obese woman to play me mum.  Oh, right.  And we're trying to ship one in from Australia, but we're having visa problems. 
[02:27:00]  It's true.  It's true.  Really?  Yeah, because, you know, if you're a famous actress, they'll just give you the visa and  let you come over and work.  But we're like, they're like, what's this humongous lady you want?  What is she doing?  I can't wait to check that out.  Yeah, absolutely.  I sent a few of the actresses to my mother.  I sent photos.  And she's like, you must really hate me.  I'm like, what, am I going to get a good-looking chick? 
[02:27:30]  What am I going to get a fucking chick?  No, no.  You've got to get a supermodel or something.  Your mom's doing all right?  Ah, she's all right, yes.  She's, you know, she can't leave the house anymore, which is a blessing.  But, you know, she's all right, yeah.  Why can't she leave the house?  Well, she's too fat now, really.  Oh, man.  So are they going to be cutting her out of her home eventually?  No, no. 
[02:28:00]  No.  My dad won't notice she's dead for a while.  I know.  Jesus.  She'll probably disintegrate the same way that dad let the rat in the wall die.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's nice.  All right.  Well, Jim, congratulations on Carnegie Hall.  That's fucking great.  And go see Jim Jeffries.  Yeah, please go get tickets now.  Yes.  That's going to be an amazing show as part of the Comedy Festival, for sure. 
[02:28:30]  We have Kevin Pollack here.  He's right outside the studio.  Yeah.  He's going to be coming in in a minute or two, I gather.  We're doing something with him, aren't we?  Yeah, we're filming a little something.  A little something.  Should be cool.  Mr. Jeffries, thank you so much.  Thanks for having us, guys.  I appreciate it.  We'll talk to you soon, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  When are you going to be in New York?  Well, probably November 9th.  Oh, that'll be the next time?  I might get in on a Friday or something and come and see you guys. 
[02:29:00]  You should.  Come in early and do the show, man.  Yeah.  All right, Jim.  All right.  Talk to you soon.  Jim Jeffries, everyone.  Carnegie Hall, November 9th.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool for a comic, man.  Kevin is here.  Yes.  Nice.  We're doing something 530-ish or something.  Yes.  They were filming a little something.  Is he talking about, I guess it made the trades that he's filming a movie, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's all over.  Kind of a documentary?  I think so.  Yeah.  On what? 
[02:29:30]  Comedians?  Yeah, and comedy's attachment to misery or whatever.  It's the dark side of comics?  Yes.  Yeah.  Or with Kevin, yeah.  Yeah, get him in here.  He should have filmed our part while we're on the radio.  Oh, yeah?  He can always get B-roll.  Oh, I kind of like that.  Kevin, you should have filmed us here.  Why is that?  Because this is our safety blanket.  I tried.  I mean, our like, yeah.  I tried, actually.  You tried.  What was the holdup?  I don't know.  I kind of like the idea of sitting there.  Actually, when you see where I'm forcing you to go. 
[02:30:00]  Ah.  Really?  Yeah.  It's going to elicit, really, the creature out of its habitat.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, I'm a filmmaker now, fellas.  Yes.  You're growing the filmmaker beard, I say.  I just want to look 14 years older.  Right.  So I thought I would grow.  Yeah, yeah.  A little older.  How far into it are you?  Just that we started this week here.  So right before we came here, we shot Freddie Prinze Jr. talking about his dad for the first 
[02:30:30]  time on camera, which was fucking amazing.  Wow.  What did he have to say?  Great stories.  Just amazing.  Yeah.  He was just not even one years old when his dad took himself out.  And so I said, you know, how old were you before the first person put their fat finger  in your face and said, do you know who you thought it was?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Growing up with that.  So, you know, he's hilarious, and he was hilarious talking about his dad and finally  got to the point where he could, you know, tell these great stories that had been told 
[02:31:00]  to him.  Like when, okay, so first of all, I don't know if you know, because it's hard to remember  this shit, but his dad was guest host of The Tonight Show at 19.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Having only appeared once.  Holy shit.  One time, and Carson said, now you need to guest host.  You're that good.  And 19 years old.  Wow.  Ridiculous.  Right?  So at 20, he's starring in the TV show.  I just saw, it's just three years of white, hot, crazy. 
[02:31:30]  He was 23 when he shot himself?  22.  Wow.  He was only 22 when he shot himself?  And why did he do it?  Drugs.  It was drugs?  Oh, yeah.  What was he on?  The cocaine?  They found it was all kinds of cocaine and quaaludes and, you know.  Yeah.  So here's the thing.  So he and Pryor are best friends when Freddie Sr. is 21 years old.  And he knows Pryor's got a serious heart on for Pam Greer.  So Freddie finds Pam Greer and a very young, as the story goes, Joanna Kearns, who ended  up being the mother on... 
[02:32:00]  On, uh, yeah, if I can know that show.  The Severs.  The Severs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Growing pains.  Growing pains.  God damn it.  I was pushed into a corner.  Sorry.  You think she was hot back then?  She was 19 or 20, so probably.  She was pretty hot.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  She was all right.  So Freddie rolls up with those two, and Pryor's got such a heart on for Pam Greer that he's  losing his shit, right?  And decides, after a little while, maybe 20 minutes, to put on a reel-to-reel tape, this  being the mid-70s, of Freddie doing stand-up from, like, a couple of weeks ago bombing at 
[02:32:30]  the comedy store.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's what entertains Pryor, is to put that on with the girls there.  And Freddie says, turn that shit off, man.  And Pryor's laughing.  Seriously, turn that shit off.  And Pryor's laughing.  And finally, Freddie gets up and lays him out with two punches.  Wow.  Knocks him out.  Knocks out Pryor.  Knocks him out, grabs the girls, and leaves.  Wow.  So that's the story Freddie Jr. decides to share, and I'm like, this is fucking awesome.  That's awesome.  I've never heard that.  Yeah, just so that kind of, you know, and his mom took him to a comedy club when he  was 14 and said, I want you to see what your father did. 
[02:33:00]  And from that moment on, Freddie Jr. just became this absolute student and fan of stand-up.  He's quoting Bobby Slayton's act.  I mean, he knows everybody's fucking act.  It was unbelievable.  Is he a comic himself?  No, never was.  Why?  Never was.  He just got into the acting.  He wanted to do the acting.  That's a hard act to follow, too, and you have the same name.  You know, Freddie Prinze Jr.  That's a rough one.  What has he done in acting?  Well, I met him on the movie that kind of made him a matinee idol, if that's even a  fucking thing anymore, a term from the 40s. 
[02:33:30]  She's all that.  And that's when he kind of became a movie star, right then in that moment.  He's been in a lot of shit, right?  And then did a whole bunch of other movies, you know.  But we don't really...  And then not so much.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, he and the wifey there had a couple of babies.  Oh, yeah.  They popped out two kids.  Yes, they do.  The documentary about his father was called He Couldn't Hear the Laughter, I think.  That was Freddie's...  That was a really cool name for a comedy documentary, I thought.  Uh, the only one I know was a TV movie, which was awful. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, man.  I never saw a documentary.  The TV movie was...  Well, maybe it was a documentary.  Maybe it was that.  Who played him in the TV movie.  Oh, man.  Flip Wilson was a really bad choice.  Yeah, I just remember, uh...  Anyways, so, yeah.  Did you know him or no?  So we did that.  I worked with him on She's All That.  That's how we became...  No, no, I mean Freddie.  You never met Freddie.  Oh, no, no.  I was quite younger, but already aware of who was on The Tonight Show.  But I didn't even remember that he guest-hosted it. 
[02:34:30]  I didn't remember that either.  That's fucking crazy.  I do remember him having to say,  Looking good all the time.  Yep.  That was like a big catchphrase from Chico and the Man.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, God.  So then we came here, and I did, you know,  Louis Black and Whoopi and Alan Zweibel and Jim Gaffigan and Verbiglia.  And, uh, today you guys and Amy Schumer.  I hear Gaffigan is a big cock.  Has?  Yeah, I've heard that.  Yeah?  Wait, we... 
[02:35:00]  How does that get out there?  I don't know.  Someone probably saw it.  He's an ex-Indiana wrestler.  Gaffigan looks like a thick-cocked individual.  Because he's got fucking giant forearms.  Gaffigan's a sneakily fucking bull-strong animal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, like people look always at the glasses.  He's probably nerdy.  And then you look at his forearms.  You're like, this guy could fucking lift up a truck.  He does look like one of those guys that was born and raised on a farm.  Yeah.  That could just carry a cowl.  Yeah, just a big wrestler carrying equipment around.  Big dummy.  Yeah.  Too stupid to put a jacket on in 10-degree weather. 
[02:35:30]  Has people just been like, wow, this is really a great idea.  And coming right to you, you got to pull some teeth to get people?  No, we locked up now almost 50 people to sit.  Wow.  I know.  It's going to be like 50 to 70 hours of film.  I don't know.  You know, I'm going to edit for a year, I think.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  But also, it's kind of really expanded way beyond the initial premise, which was, do  you have to be miserable to be funny?  And now it's everyone who chooses to be funny for a living now fascinates the fuck out of 
[02:36:00]  me.  Yeah, yeah.  98% of children suffer from, hey, look at me.  That's what a child is.  Look at me.  Look at me.  I want attention.  Yeah.  Take a picture.  Right, right.  Who the fuck are we that choose that as a career?  Yeah, yeah.  And what the fuck is the matter with us?  Honestly.  Well, yeah, that is just an odd attention whore-ish thing to want to get into.  But for a career.  Yeah.  That'll be my job.  I think it's lack of attention.  Sure.  Growing up. 
[02:36:30]  Sure.  It's the number one thing.  Yeah, but I think everyone.  To some kind of showbiz.  I think everyone suffers from that, but we're the ones.  Right, right.  So why, you know, what makes the difference between that and then making the jump to, I  just want to do this as a job.  Because it's the ones that really did not get the attention.  Every kid thinks they're not getting the attention, but then there's the people that  absolutely did not for whatever reason.  My whole life was a Lenny and Squiggy entrance.  My case, my mom, she was a me, me, me person. 
[02:37:00]  Same here.  We didn't get fucking attention.  Right.  It was all about her.  It always revolved around her.  Yeah.  My mom.  She would say she made all these sacrifices and bullshit, but no.  Because she's the center of attention.  Right.  But we knew it was all about her always.  Right.  Always.  Yeah.  Just want your voice to be heard.  That's why I do radio.  I know.  I'm not stupid.  I don't want to be heard.  Literally hearing your own voice.  Right.  Two headphones.  Hey, what about, you know, a house with seven kids?  Hey, what about me?  Over here.  And then the ones we did bring in from time to time, we always had a house full of people. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  But the other kids must have been suffering from the same.  Absolutely.  Right.  And they didn't choose.  I mean.  Yeah.  Somehow they didn't go on to it.  I mean, public speaking is America's number one fear.  So.  Yeah.  So who the fuck chooses to do that?  Right.  To do that.  Why didn't anyone in my family go into, like, this type of work?  Because didn't they also, like, over here?  Yes.  Of course.  And still to this day a little?  Wow, man.  All right.  Now I've got to go deeper and try to figure this out.  Well, that's the thing is, I'm actually not going to as many deep, dark places because 
[02:38:00]  I don't think that's now as interesting as how and why and what the fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  As opposed to, why are you sad?  You know, it's not.  Because quite frankly, at this point in their lives, nobody is fucking sad.  I mean, they've had bouts.  Right.  And struggled.  Yeah.  We've all had struggling bouts.  Richard Jenny was sad.  Sure.  And we're going to talk to the woman he was living with for many years.  In fact, she went downstairs to make him pancakes when he took himself out upstairs. 
[02:38:30]  This is something I want to ask you.  How many comics do you guys know?  Because you're way more in that world than us, obviously, that are completely normal and don't  have some weird dark side or some little addiction or what have you.  Or something, yeah.  I think it's the same thing as this.  Like, is Seinfeld the normal guy?  I think it's, you know, when that term dysfunctional family came around and then it didn't take  too long before everyone said, everyone's fucking dysfunctional family.  I think now that can be said, too.  I don't think it's rare anymore for people to be messed up.  I think we're all... 
[02:39:00]  But do you know a few comics that seem to be well-adjusted, extremely normal lives where  they could easily just be a regular guy if they weren't on stage?  Maybe 1% and nobody's really coming to mind.  I don't know any.  I'm sure they exist.  No one's coming to mind.  No.  Not really.  I'm sure Seinfeld has something.  I don't know him well enough.  I'm sure he has something.  Oh, please.  Even if it's a higher volume of narcissism than your average bear, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  We saw Brian Regan's dark side a little bit.  A little bit.  I don't know whose spot we want to blow up. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, see, there's...  He got a few in them.  He was a different Brian Regan.  I saw Regan's.  I think he's...  One night.  Oh, my God.  It was great.  He was Michael Rooker from Mississippi Burning.  It was a guy that's not edgy on stage, doesn't curse, none of that, nothing blue.  We closed Caroline's and then went to some bar across the street and we did tequila shots.  And Regan just...  He literally went from the, hey, how you doing?  You know, the bouncy stage guy to both elbows, like, on the bar, but his chin almost on the 
[02:40:00]  bar with his eyes going sideways, back and forth, going, look at these motherfuckers.  Just like evil.  Evil Brian.  You saw the eyes change and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, he wasn't inside anymore?  And believe me, I loved him.  It was great.  Yeah.  Oh, man, but, you know.  Well, that's just it.  Also, you know, the whole thing about reading a crowd and all those things that you start  to take on as your tools and all that crap. 
[02:40:30]  You know, just to ask somebody, what does Late Show Friday night mean to you?  And then see the varying reactions because you guys...  I would put you kind of in the normal category.  Well...  What would you share with us if that's a little dark?  I mean...  Because I know a lot of guys don't want to share their darkness.  That's the other problem.  He's a comic and you do impression...  Believe...  Yeah.  No one who comes from a place of being anyone but him is a happy place.  Yeah.  I keep trying to be somebody else, Opie.  What the fuck?  Do you want to know?  There you go. 
[02:41:00]  Kevin's not available right now.  He's five years old.  But guess who is?  How does schizophrenia sound?  How's that working for you, quink, quack?  Your mother was a narcissist?  Your mom was a narcissist?  Oh, fuck yeah.  No, she's still the center of attention.  She's nuts.  Party of one.  Absolutely.  Center of attention.  How many kids in your family?  Just one older brother and he won't fucking talk to her.  No, huh?  He won't talk to her?  Yeah, he's pretty much at it.  What does he do?  I mean, it's not official.  There's been no announcements.  There's no banner.  We got a few of those. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's all you now.  You keep it just nice enough.  What does he do for a living?  He runs a flooring company that's owned by a big mothership like DuPont.  One of those places.  And when the new ballpark opens up, they do the flooring.  Like, you know, we're from San Francisco.  So the Pac Bell, the AT&T Giants thing, he did the whole flooring for that whole stadium.  That's a lot of flooring.  That's a shit ton of flooring.  Yeah.  It really is.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Imagine if it was one giant piece you had to lay down.  Roll it in, fellas! 
[02:42:00]  You've got to cut it right the first time.  Yeah, you fuck it up.  400 tons of flooring.  Yeah, but there again, he clearly needed to be in charge of something.  I mean, his job is being in charge.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he sought it out.  Huh.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not laying any fucking floor.  I can promise you that.  What was your mom's thing?  Uh, I don't fucking know.  Just dancing and singing when no one gave a shit.  You know what I mean?  Oh, great.  She's like the snake pit.  Sweet Georgia Brown.  You ever saw a lady with the fucking maniac who's dancing? 
[02:42:30]  Was she ever diagnosed?  No.  No, no.  Now, it leads me to...  Never got clinical, but, you know, she went through phases of, you know, I'm okay, you're  okay, you know, that bullshit in the 70s, 80s.  Right, right.  You know, self-help crap.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm actually going somewhere with this.  It leads me to something else here, that we're all huge fans of Johnny Carson.  Yeah.  And you saw the documentary, right?  Loved it.  With his mom.  Oh, boy.  Holy fuck.  That was an eye-opener.  It was, right?  Yeah.  But then, in the end, she was saving all the shit in the closet, so she was extremely 
[02:43:00]  proud, but she would not say it publicly.  Yeah.  And what was it?  Was it Time Magazine?  We just talked about this.  Last time.  Time Magazine was over interviewing her for a big article, and what did she exactly say?  He was watching the monologue with the reporter, and the mother, at the end of the monologue,  said, well, that wasn't very funny, and then walked out of the room.  Just fantastic.  Well, the Time guy's there, and this was the time when, if you were in a magazine,  and holy fuck, you know, the whole country was going to read about it. 
[02:43:30]  I did find, I've found so far, and I think I'm going to continue to, a trend, which is  somebody like that fueled us like crazy.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, honest to God.  Right.  Yeah.  I first got to L.A. 30 years ago this month to pursue this acting nonsense, and the first  manager I met with said, well, read this scene.  Go in the other room and study it, and come back and read this scene.  And I came back in, I read the scene, and she said, okay, well, you know what?  Acting's not for everyone. 
[02:44:00]  Oh.  Maybe stand-up is really where you should continue to focus.  And I walked out of there saying, I'll fucking show you.  I mean, somebody.  Have you seen her since?  Oh, I'd set her on fire if I did.  Oh, you never saw her?  No, no.  That's great, though.  You don't know what happened to her?  Nope.  That's on a need-to-care basis at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  She probably doesn't remember you if it was just that one audition, because it's funny.  Oh, she couldn't possibly remember me.  It literally was 30 years ago.  And I was probably horrible.  I mean, she wasn't wrong, but she was shitty about it.  But she was shitty about it.  Yeah.  She didn't say, go take some classes.  She said, she just completely wrote me off. 
[02:44:30]  No nonsense.  Like, you know what?  Acting's not for everyone.  You stink.  Yeah.  We got similar lives.  It's creepy.  I was in college, and I was failing out.  I was literally failing out.  And I knew if I failed out, I was fucked.  And I wanted to do radio.  I went to school.  You got on the radio right away, 18.  So I had to go to each teacher and ask for, I just need a half a grade more to stay in  school.  And the communications teacher told me the same fucking thing.  Well, I guess college and maybe communications isn't for you.  And would not give me the grade. 
[02:45:00]  As I'm pleading, I'm like, look, I'll do anything.  Right.  I'll prove you wrong.  Just give me.  I just need, like, instead of what was it?  A C, I need a C plus, whatever.  Right.  The fucker wouldn't give it to me.  I found another teacher that had nothing to do with communications that heard my plea and  gave me a chance.  And then I never looked back.  I'm like, fuck.  I was just given a gift and I got to make sure I don't fail out of school now.  But that's the thing.  It fueled you.  And I wonder with Carson if the mom actually did him a solid by being such a bitch.  And my thing is I came from such a strict family that when I went to college, I was 
[02:45:30]  out of my fucking mind.  Yeah, of course.  So it wasn't like, I wasn't dumb, but the partying and everything else, like, what?  I could stay out to two, three in the morning and I don't have to worry about what my mom's  going to say when I get home?  Yeah.  Because we had a curfew in high school.  It was like 11, I think.  Really?  And 11.05, all hell would break loose.  Like, it was only five minutes and she would lose her fucking mind.  So you either decided to behave or be the bad kid in the house.  And I decided, fuck, just be the good kid. 
[02:46:00]  It's a lot easier.  Sure.  So then when I went to college, I was just like...  Life vacation.  I couldn't handle it because I was like, holy shit, there's a whole new world.  It's kind of like what Ann says about the Wizard of Oz, going from black and white to color.  Yeah.  That was me going to college.  Like, what the fuck?  I lived in a black and white world.  Look at all this color shit.  You had so much fun, you eventually saw flying monkeys.  Yes.  But, you know, then I almost fucked up my whole world by failing out of college.  And the one teacher that I thought would see it my way, because that was my major, said 
[02:46:30]  nope.  Holy shit.  He said, nope, sorry, maybe this just isn't for you.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  You never forget that.  Never forgot it.  No.  And I forgot the teacher's name who gave me the grade, because I would love to praise  him, and I would love to know whatever happened to that guy.  I wrote a whole thing.  Pedophile charges.  Yeah.  So again, terrible.  It's inevitable.  I pleaded my case on paper and handed it in to these guys.  Holy shit.  Each fucking teacher.  I was in trouble.  Well, you were showing some effort there.  That's what I thought. 
[02:47:00]  I'm like, look, I know what it says, and I fucked up.  I admitted.  Yeah.  You know, and I explained why, I explained some of the shit I just told you.  Right.  Nope.  Sorry.  Fuck you.  That's beautiful.  Right.  Wow.  I have some good points to make on your documentary later.  Yeah, please.  I'm going to say, Kevin Laff is a lot like a dry tear.  Hey, is there any way to get Denny Falcone in on this thing?  Denny Falcone.  You're a fan, right?  We listen all the time.  Always be dressed.  Yeah, my better half here is the one who turned me on to the fucking show. 
[02:47:30]  Nice.  Thanks.  Yeah.  No, she, yeah, it's going to be pop culture with you until the end of time.  Oh, man.  This one over here.  Yeah.  So.  Let's get Denny in.  The fucking hard drive of hits.  Are you kidding me?  This guy is magical.  What do you like about him?  He's magical.  He is.  The same thing that you guys go nuts with, with everything.  It's got its place and its purpose.  And yeah, you could simply get double-crossed the promotion over here.  Oh, it's a Saturday night.  So what do we say for Saturday night?  Isn't it great?  It's an Elton John's latest hit coming up. 
[02:48:00]  I can't wait until he comes in and you realize what a judgment error you made.  Jimmy's not a fan.  No.  It's not even a bit.  Jimmy's not a fan.  He's a fucking time capsule.  Here he is.  Oh, there he is.  There he is.  The hard drive of hits.  Permission to come on board, sir?  Oh, there he goes.  He's loving it.  She's losing her mind.  It's a hot mic, though.  Be careful.  Hot mic.  Hot mic.  Dennis Falcone.  I'm going to work stand-up today, you know.  Kevin Pollak probably just made your day.  He's a fan.  That's great. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  A fan from this show.  Yeah.  Of course.  He actually wrote me and said that he was a fan.  Yeah.  So this isn't even for the radio.  That's true.  That's great.  Could I ask Sal if I could get a picture with him?  All right.  You've got to ask Sal.  Sal gets very upset when Dennis decides to take pictures with the celebrities that come  in.  Proper channels here.  Yes.  Go through the proper channels.  Well, I think Mr. Falcone is all about proper channels.  Of course.  If I've learned anything by listening to you on this show, it's that there's a proper channel  and a rule for everything.  You have to have rules, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  How would you cross-promote the word rules right now and on the other music channels available  on Sirius?  Well, we do have many rules on many of the other channels.  It's exactly what we play, like we have the Metal Channel, which is promoting the Metallica  show, the concert, that you can only win by going to SiriusXM.com.  So I've just promoted that, so you've got to make sure that you're cross-promoting.  I was working on the 60s channel, and I was playing some Steppenwolf, which would be  a forerunner to the musical genre of Metallica, metal music, right?  Oh, okay.  Sure, sure.  I'm still lacking the word rules. 
[02:49:30]  Rules.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  That was the bridge.  The bridge.  Rules.  Let me see.  One of my rules is always to go into the studio fully prepared.  Right, yes.  Fully prepared.  And yet, contrary to...  Oh, good.  Right now, contrary to that rule.  I just kind of stumbled in.  Can I...  There's a rule that I guaranteed you learned years ago that me and Ann broke, and that's  why we're so fucking successful.  Yes.  And that is the rule of leaving your problems on the other side of the door. 
[02:50:00]  You tell them.  Yeah, there you go.  Exactly.  Every PD would tell you, any problems you got, you leave them behind.  Nobody wants to hear them.  No one wants to hear them.  As soon as you fucking enter that studio, you leave all that outside the studio, right?  And you're right.  Sure, exactly.  You've made a career out of just problems.  Yes!  Just the problems.  Not only fucking bringing them in, but creating them in here.  Right, it's true.  Leaving any goodwill we might have outside.  So how would you cross-promote the problems show?  My mantra is good times and great oldies, but here's one by the Ebbly Brothers. 
[02:50:30]  It's problems.  One of those great 50s hits that you'd hear on the 50s on Fox.  That's it.  He just crossed.  Problems, problems.  Little information.  He's the Larry Klein of SiriusXM.  Kevin, now you're a fan of Denny Falcone.  Hard Drive of Hits.  But not so much of a fan that you're going to be filming him today, right?  You know, do you have a lot to say about comedy?  I wasn't on the spot at all there.  You're a big fan of comedy, right?  Of course, of course.  What do you know about comedy? 
[02:51:00]  If there's a documentary called Misery Loves Comedy, that would be something you'd want  to talk about.  Sure, why not?  Well, why not is not a correct answer.  No, no.  Why not?  There's got to be a better reason.  You're kind of auditioning right now for Kevin Pollack.  I'll do some research before I go in.  Research?  You've got years of experience.  What do you know about comics?  Yeah, and comedy.  Who's your favorite comedian?  Rodney Dangerfield.  Oh, boy.  Anyone from this century?  This century?  Let me see.  There's a lot of good talent out there.  Jim Norton happens to be one of my favorites.  That would be a correct answer.  That's a good answer. 
[02:51:30]  That's a good one.  And how would you cross-promote Jim right now?  Jim Norton is also one of our music hosts, as well as being heard every weekday morning  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh-huh.  All the way with O and A.  All the way?  Was that made up just now?  No, that's all the way with O and A.  That's an old mantra.  You've got to use that, Joe.  All the way with O and A.  Let me ask you this.  Do you have a backup copy of the hard drive of Hits?  Oh, sure.  I have three.  Three backups.  Three.  Are they in three different locations?  Yes.  One is in Pete Townsend's house.  No, it's Gary Glinard's.  I always... 
[02:52:00]  Yes.  When I go out to perform, I always carry the movie.  Three fucking celebrity pedophiles yanked out of thin air, all attached to music.  We did learn yesterday that he's a pedophile.  No, I'm not a pedophile.  Well, according to Sal.  Sorry, I should have added that part.  You just can't throw that word around.  No, you really can.  You're right.  But Sal thinks you are.  Well, you can.  You can.  Technically, until lawsuits arrive.  Right, right, right.  Yes, a cease and desist.  Wow.  So, I had Richard Blade come to the house and spin some wax for a 30th party. 
[02:52:30]  Nice.  Because it was an 80s theme.  Okay, yeah.  And I understand you, too, travel with a hard drive of Hits, and people can...  For sure.  ...pay you to come to the party and spin the wax.  Have you had him at the compound?  Yes.  At the compound, what a great time we had.  How many hours was he there?  Until the cops came.  Until the cops came.  Yeah, well, that's every party at the compound. 
[02:53:00]  That's how the party's at.  Right, true.  The cops came and they said, turn it up, you nerd.  How many breaks, let's say, in a five-hour shift will you take?  Oh, it's continuous.  There's no breaks.  Oh, I don't take a break.  Oh, no, he just does a caffeter.  What's happening?  No, we keep the music going.  If you want me to knock it down because you guys are having some dinner, you know, I'll play some background music.  Maybe some Sinatra, some Dean Martin, some Michael BublÃ©.  Because that's the kind of parties at the compound.  They all decide to have dinner at the same point.  A little dinner fucking, yeah, yeah.  It was a little loud when Jim came in. 
[02:53:30]  Remember?  Yes, it was actually too loud.  He panicked.  I heard that.  Yeah.  It was too loud.  Why do I picture these parties like any pool at the major hotels in Vegas?  Just people dancing and jumping up in the air?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Is that how I am?  Pogoing.  Yes, without the diversity.  Please.  Oh, my God.  But the basement was more like Playboy After Dark.  Yes.  Among the girls.  He was going on down there.  Bill Cosby walking in and just talking to him.  He was saying, where's the Jill and Putin? 
[02:54:00]  Because we've got the thing on your face.  Are you ever relieved when the cops show up?  Sometimes.  Like, relieved, like, thank God I can finally shut this party down.  Yeah, yeah.  There are times.  I was talking to the cops out on the lawn, and that's when Denny made an appearance with  the hula hoops.  Jesus.  And he comes out from the side of the house as I'm talking to the police, and he goes,  I forgot to bring out the hula hoops.  And I just looked at him.  I looked at the cops.  I threw my arms up like, ah.  It was like the same delivery.  Pesci was kind of upset that there was blood on the floor. 
[02:54:30]  Sorry about your floor, Henry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got the blow-up instruments?  Oh, yeah.  What do you got?  The saxophone?  I got the guitars.  I just noticed that Dean Martin would call the police on his own parties.  I did just hear that.  To stop.  To stop.  He'd had enough.  So he would secretly go upstairs.  How fucking funny is that?  That's great.  Dean Martin, the famous Lush, who they say half the time was iced tea in his glass, he  would go upstairs and call the police.  And they'd show up and he'd say, I'm sorry, everybody. 
[02:55:00]  We've got to shut up.  Because he just didn't know how to get people out of his house.  Wait, what's the iced tea rumor?  Iced tea rumor?  Oh, no.  In his glass.  Oh, in his glass.  I thought you meant iced tea.  Kind of iced tea.  Iced tea.  No, that it wasn't booze.  Half the time it wasn't booze.  That he wasn't really...  But he was a raging alcoholic.  Well, this is the rumors.  Maybe not so much.  Maybe he was an act at some...  Ah.  I mean, that's been around for a while.  That's not a good Hollywood story.  That's not a new...  That's not how...  I haven't heard that one.  Did you ever see Sinatra live? 
[02:55:30]  No.  I did.  I saw him a couple times.  I saw him at the Westchester Premiere Theater years ago, back in the late 70s.  Sinatra's doing like a whole nice, you know, slow songs, ballads and everything.  Dean Martin walks out with a rolling bar.  With a rolling bar to the front and starts pouring drinks for people.  What do you have, pal?  What do you have?  Oh, that's beautiful.  Yeah.  For the audience.  Yeah.  They like it.  There's nowhere.  In case the listeners didn't know, the hard drive of hits are, what are you, in the early  70s now?  Oh, no.  My age or the music?  You.  No, I'm not. 
[02:56:00]  Double nickels.  55.  Double nickels.  Jimmy's disgusted.  You don't like the double nickels, Jimmy?  Double nickels.  No.  Not even if you literally have 10 cents, do I like that.  No.  Double nickels.  55.  That's just the way to say it.  55.  55.  55.  Yeah.  Would you put...  But the music goes back, you know, to the 1940s all the way up to today.  Technically, music goes back a little further.  Even further than the 40s.  Yeah, but I mean, I don't bring acetates or anything, but I mean, I do have everything  from big band.  Okay.  Because you have to look at the age of people. 
[02:56:30]  Like, just this past weekend, I did a 40th wedding anniversary.  So people were in their early 60s.  Right.  The latest record I played was 1983, It's Raining Men.  Of course you're going to play It's Raining Men.  Well, I also, you're going to get everyone on the floor.  They were just going crazy.  They were just going wild, yeah.  Although I did play their Blurred Lines.  Did you?  Oh, well, one of the topical new hits.  Yeah, that's a great one to play at a transgendered party.  As we all fight the obvious while we dance.  Did you just say the people in their early 60s were going nuts to the music? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, they were going crazy, yeah.  It turns out it was two heart attacks and a stroke.  You're going to play some of that Saturday Night Fever music, aren't you?  I said, sure, come on.  Oh, they liked that.  Oh, they liked the Saturday Night Fever.  And I get out there and I do a little strut, you know, that Travolta was doing, walking  down 86th Street in Brooklyn?  Sure.  Did it stay in the live?  You know what?  You probably could have played later than 81, a few of the songs from Dirty Dancing, maybe.  Oh, I did.  We did that.  You did that?  Oh, yeah.  We were out there doing the contours. 
[02:57:30]  Way ahead of you.  Right on.  Yeah, I know.  Who am I talking to?  I should know.  Right in the middle of a shout, I usually bang right into the contours.  You do?  It drives them into a frenzy.  It's just a violent word for you.  Bang them into the contours.  What is the other one with the contours?  Do You Love Me?  Oh, okay.  1962 hit music.  A little contours.  I just can't get enough.  Honestly and truly.  But what about the big hit song from that?  I had the time of my...  Usually the rap-up song. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, you do?  Yeah, I hope everybody had themselves a good time today.  Well, once again, a nice round of applause for our guests of honor, Shirley and Jack,  celebrating 40 years together.  And we wish them another 40 years.  How about it?  Let's hear it for one more time.  The reason we came out to celebrate.  I'm sorry, but Shirley and Jack, you just picked the perfect couple's name.  They really did.  Let's hear it for Shirley and Jack.  I bet you Jack doesn't want another 40 years.  Exactly.  Jack's had it.  Yeah, like they'll both be 100.  We both know they're going to be dead shortly.  Shirley's got a fucking half a bra left. 
[02:58:30]  Fuck them.  He made them up.  Fuck Shirley.  Fuck Shirley right in her mouth.  I like to watch a horse kick her fucking fake decanter.  I really don't work.  I love Shirley.  Shirley's a cunt.  Poor Shirley, right?  Honest to God.  How much more, Denny, if you just talk the whole party and there's no actual music happening?  Would that be great?  How much more if you just do segues? 
[02:59:00]  Yes.  No, no.  That would be great.  Just not talk during the party?  No, I want only just the talking.  Oh, no, that's the personality.  That personality is part of the price.  Anybody can just stand there and just play the music.  I'm not saying part of the price.  I'm saying all the price.  How much to just talk?  I don't want music.  I just want you to talk for five hours.  No, that would be a boring party.  You're just going to stand there and talk.  No, how much to read Mein Kampf over a laugh track?  That's a legitimate question, Denny.  It really is.  Once somebody hired me, they just wanted me to play big band music for four hours. 
[02:59:30]  That's it, huh?  And that was tough.  Shirley and Jack.  Yeah, that was tough.  Shirley and Jack.  Shirley and Jack.  Those two.  How did you pull that one off?  And this was back in the days of vinyl, too.  So I needed a lot of records before CDs.  You needed some 78s.  Yes.  Well, you know, I had them on 33s, but it was tough.  Did you pull it off?  Oh, yeah, sure.  Sure, you had to.  You have to give the customer what they want.  Well, of course.  I don't think I've ever heard them referred to as 33s.  We know they're 33s, but there's always other LPs or albums.  That may be the first time I've actually heard. 
[03:00:00]  78s, you always hear by the number, but 33s.  I'm going to spend some 33s now.  I worked at a radio station.  It was back in a farming community, and every morning from 5.30 to 6, we had to play polka music  because there was a lot of Polish people in the community.  So one morning, I didn't know that the, I had the turntable in the wrong gear.  I had the polka record, which was an LP 33, in 45.  Uh-oh.  What?  It didn't sound any different to me.  Wow.  This is one of those stories.  It's a crazy story.  At the jingle party?  At the hotel?  Hold on.  Sit down first.  Wait till you hear this. 
[03:00:30]  You didn't have it on 45?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Yeah, if you were to write the sitcom version starring the hard drive of hits, that'd be  the opening scene.  Right, right.  So are you ready for this?  Right.  Polka music at 45 RPM.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Absolutely.  And then Dolph Sweet grabs his chest and falls down the steps.  He's got a Polish-eyed man.  It's like that EDM music today.  It was so high energy.  It was just frenetic.  I remember as a kid, it was always funny to put the 33 and a third on 45, and, you know, 
[03:01:00]  you listen to the Beatles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was always fun.  I wouldn't take my records to people's parties.  What?  Because I wouldn't, I would want to be the person to put the record on the Petrola.  On the closing play?  Yeah, because, you know, people would scratch it.  I would hate when people would have those record cases.  Remember the plastic one with the spindle?  Oh, yeah.  And they would take the sleeves off and just put the records on top of each other.  Oh, my God.  That's not good.  That's not good.  That just scratches him.  I didn't realize the added bonus of having Denny here was the abject frustration of Jim. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, Jimmy's not a fan.  This is the best part of the...  He's not a fan.  He's disgusting.  How was I never catching on to that?  Oh, he's...  At home.  Jimmy hates what we call Denny.  It's not that I don't like Denny.  I do like Denny.  Yeah?  That's why you went right to Words with Friends.  Yeah, well, I have a fucking...  I have a fucking Q, two I's.  I'm going to play in Pong.  An H and I and a V.  Denny, what was the first record you bought? 
[03:02:00]  First record I bought?  We were just talking about this the other day.  Oh, yeah.  It might have been the Chipmunk's Christmas album.  Of course it was.  Of course it was.  It had to be a novelty song.  Yeah.  You're a fan of the novelty song?  Oh, I love the novelty song.  First record you bought, though.  Dickie Goodman?  You like those?  Yeah.  Hey, Mr. John!  It was the Chipmunk's Christmas album.  And the Beatles' first album, too.  Meet the Beatles.  Yeah?  Yeah, sure.  Right from the Christmas Chipmunks to the Beatles.  Yeah.  That's kind of a jump.  Very fast transition.  It's a big jump.  Just play them over and over. 
[03:02:30]  What did you use to put on if, you know, you were kind of getting down?  Before Barry White, what was your go-to?  Yeah, what would you put on to cover the screams?  The sound of a hammer claw hitting her.  Temptations.  Temptations, 1965, My Girl.  My Girl?  Oh, yeah.  Tall, tan, and talented, baby.  The Temptations.  Nice.  How about the Four Tops?  Four Tops.  Sure.  Four Tops Spinning, yeah.  They're the two.  Four Tops Spinning.  That's going to be high on a Friday.  More up-tempo stuff.  More up-tempo music.  Did I tell you guys when I...  Dominant game, man.  No, the Four Tops are spinning. 
[03:03:00]  Sloppy bottom.  Did I ever tell you guys that story when I did Casino in Rickles?  I was stuck there for 20 weeks shooting that fucking movie, even though I'm only in it  nine weeks, nine minutes.  The way, of course, it says he shoots is that you're just stuck there because he might change  his mind any given day so they make you stay.  So I said to my stand-up agent, book me on the fucking strip opening up for somebody.  You know, I'm stuck here, so get me a gig.  So he gets me a gig opening up for the Four Tops.  And I come into work on the movie, and Rickles says, oh, I see you in a marquee there.  You're opening up for the Four Tops.  That's great.  I'm with Frank all summer.  Let me know if you want tickets. 
[03:03:30]  I'm just trying to make a buck while I'm stuck there, and he fucking hammered me right  in the face.  I'm with Frank all summer.  Let me know if you want tickets.  I was just watching that the other day, and that fucking look you give when you're signing  those papers, and you've got to look up like, oh, I'm fucked.  Yeah, yeah.  That's such a great look.  I can't not watch.  You look at a great moment in that movie when Pesci murders the woman who's suing.  Put your head down gently?  Yeah.  That was obvious.  Was that a Pesci thing, or maybe you don't know?  Oh, no.  That was a Pesci thing. 
[03:04:00]  He just decided to lovingly love her.  That was really sick.  That was such an odd assassination shot.  It was great.  Yeah, yeah.  Because there's really no reason.  He could just walk out.  He could pop her and walk.  Fuck Pesci.  Not taking a picture after an all-night flight.  Fuck Pesci.  Oh, right.  Right, right, right, right, right.  And I could have taken video of him snoring with his mouth wide open.  I didn't do it.  End up on TMZ.  Fuck.  Hey, what's Joe Pesci doing?  The guy hanging over the back. 
[03:04:30]  I bet he's tired.  As they're drinking their fucking lattes, their sugary coffee drink.  I smack myself every time I click on one of those TMZ links on Twitter.  I'm like, what am I doing?  Why am I even doing it?  And then the dumb voiceover.  Hey, did somebody say?  Oh, fuck yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  Go fuck yourself.  I just can't stand it.  I can't stand him.  I can't stand that Harvey Levin piece of shit.  Harvey Levin.  The one that doesn't commit to anything?  Just a vulture. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, that's beautiful.  Just a piece from people's court.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he makes a fortune on the dregs of other people.  Just a vulture.  Yeah.  Absolute.  Fucking worst ambulance chaser ever.  Even the paparazzi used to be like somebody.  Like they had to have the equipment and everything.  Now it's just some fucking skell with a cell phone asking embarrassing questions of people.  You get off any flight at JFK or LA, the cross-country flights, there's somebody with these knuckleheads at every fucking baggage claim.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:05:30]  What did you think of Kim Kardashian's lady?  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Abdul-Jabbar was on my flight coming from LA.  Kareem?  Yes.  No, Mike Abdul-Jabbar.  Kareem, I probably should have specified that.  Mike Abdul-Jabbar is a guy that works for Allstate.  And he hooks me up on my insurance rates.  Oh, okay.  And he was on your flight.  It was so bizarre.  Yeah, he walked in, he winked at me because we know the insurance rate he's been getting.  It's a really cool story. 
[03:06:00]  Does he have trouble like sitting and...  Yeah, it was really weird.  I thought it was him and I see him getting on.  He didn't even recognize me because I said, hey, good to see you again, Kareem.  I mean, he really didn't look up.  He's just like, oh, hey, man.  And he just sat down and his publicist was with him.  And I looked at one point.  It was very funny because he had dozed off where he was sitting there.  It's so hard for him to get comfortable.  No shit.  He has to just sit up and lean against the window.  And he had his fucking blanket over his head.  He looked like E.T.  He's just towering above everybody.  And I watched him walk to the bathroom. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, that bathroom's got to be something.  I'm like, how the...  He must have to sit when he...  There's no way...  I don't know how he would pull that off.  He could stand up in that fucking bathroom and comfortably piss.  I've had some great flights where you just kind of dunk your head against that little  slanty wall by the bathroom and you're just pissing, bouncing around a little.  Yeah.  So he...  I bet you he sits to piss.  He must have...  He's just too big a dude.  Yeah.  That's how I picture him.  Yeah, or kneeling and pissing.  Just sitting and pissing in a plane.  When I think about it.  Every time I think about it.  Oh, he's a big man. 
[03:07:00]  What's the matter, Sam?  Nothing.  Oh.  Why are you saying that?  Because he's wearing salmon pants standing against a trash can?  Like impending doom.  Yeah.  He's probably wearing why he's not in his chair.  Are we done with Danny?  Danny, I just...  Gentlemen, thank you so much.  It's an honor.  We're going to need to take a photo.  We'll ask Sal.  Without a doubt.  But, yeah.  Wait, we've got a...  The girl here needs a photo.  We're about to move into fall.  What should we be doing as a radio show?  What should we be doing moving into fall? 
[03:07:30]  What is that?  Well, of course, you've got the fall festivals.  The fall festivals.  You've got the weekend.  You've got...  Not really a lot of fall songs.  Not really a lot of fall songs.  No fall themes?  Autumn leaves?  Autumn leaves a little too.  Well, Roger Williams at the keyboard.  Very nice instrumental, though.  That's a beautiful instrumental.  How soon before we start?  What are you pushing to Halloween?  Halloween, basically, October.  That's begun.  We're seven weeks out.  Yeah, October because...  We're less than seven weeks out.  You do Rocktober, Jocktober.  You also do a safe Halloween.  When does Jocktober?  I know.  I know.  What do you mean a safe Halloween? 
[03:08:00]  A safe Halloween.  With the kids.  What do you mean a safe Halloween?  Safe Halloween.  We used to do that all the time.  Good times and great oldies.  We'll be down at the mall for you this weekend.  As we bring the kids down.  You bring the kids down to walk through the mall.  No.  That ain't happening.  No, you don't.  Seven percent less razor blades this year.  And I used to wear the costume.  I was the mascot for the radio station.  I used to wear the duck.  No, no.  I used to wear the duck costume.  What does that mean?  It was a mascot suit.  Sure.  Because every radio station should have a mascot.  We had a duck because I worked on Long Island.  You go anywhere in the world, you pick up a menu, and you see, gee, Long Island duck. 
[03:08:30]  So I wore the duck costume.  That's a moment of pride for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I would walk around the mall taking pictures with kids.  Were you allowed to speak?  Kids love that stuff.  No.  No, no.  No.  No speaking.  Not inside that costume.  No speaking.  Danny, do the library because we're wrapping up for today.  My advice show, by the way, is today at 10.  I didn't do it yesterday because I had an appointment.  So today I'm doing it.  Nice.  People look forward to the year.  I love that show.  I have to go to John Sahag and get my her did.  For the big movie shoot.  Oh, well, yeah.  I hope they fuck it up in afros and it's red. 
[03:09:00]  That's what I'm going for.  We have a wonderful makeup artist.  Oh, good.  She'll powder you up and lose all the pasty from the three.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah, great.  Give you a little tan.  That's all I need.  She's a member of a Mexican cartel.  She'll put your head back and shave your fucking larynx.  Keep saying that word wrong.  Kevin, always a pleasure.  What else are we promoting, buddy?  For me?  Nothing?  Oh, no, no.  Just a movie thing?  We're working on the movie.  I'm in a couple movies that are coming out before year's end, but fuck that. 
[03:09:30]  And fuck them.  Nice.  That's a guy with a real career.  A guy who throws away a couple of movies he's in.  A couple of movies.  I did a table read last night for a friend and it's all I wanted to talk about for four hours.  I didn't fuck up.  You want to promote your table read.  I really do.  Oh, my God.  That's fantastic.  I got to get out of here.  Yeah.  I got a cap.  Yeah.  I got a cap.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor.  And your chance to speak directly with him. 
[03:10:00]  Call 866-969-1969.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  Hello.  The Jim Norton Show.  And today I'm doing it on Thursday because yesterday I had to pre-record my Gene Simmons  interview for my Boneyard show. 
[03:10:30]  And Gene does like to plug.  However, I like him very much.  When does it air?  It aired last night.  Oh, okay.  Good.  But I just, you know, I don't want to do a half-hour advice show.  They're paying me handsomely.  I feel it's my duty to do a good show, Eric.  I don't know what happened to the first guy.  Let's go with David, drug problem help.  Hello, David.  Hey, Jim.  Is that you?  It is, sir.  Yes.  Hey, I'm a big fan, man. 
[03:11:00]  Thank you.  As you can tell, I'm a kind of younger guy.  How old are you?  I'm 20 right now.  Okay.  But I just have problems, man.  Well, what problems do you have?  Well, I got into drugs and shit.  I dropped out of school because I was diagnosed with depression and all that. 
[03:11:30]  And none of those drugs could help me, so.  Well, let me ask you a question.  You dropped out of school.  Um, are you under the influence now?  No, no, I'm not.  I only do, like, pills and all that shit.  Well, what is your dilemma now?  Do you want to stop doing what you're doing?  Yeah, it's just a cycle.  I'm stuck in the rut, you know? 
[03:12:00]  Believe me, I definitely know.  That's the hardest part sometimes.  It's just, it's the cycle of it.  Because then you feel like, okay, okay, I'll quit or I'll do this or I'll move on.  And then you do okay for a little while.  And then all of a sudden, the one thing happens that puts us back into it.  And then we're right back in the pattern, the whole thing.  And then you're like, oh, fuck.  I got to run out the string again.  I know, I know where this is going.  Well, the first thing is, I mean, school is great.  But the first thing you want to do, or I would suggest doing, is getting off drugs. 
[03:12:30]  I mean, that's the most important thing you can do.  So what is it that is keeping you on drugs?  Why are you continuing to do them?  Well, I don't know.  My parents, they keep on, they're like really fragile and shit.  So I have to take care of them.  What's that got to do with you doing drugs?  Well, it adds to a lot of the pressure.  I try to just kind of bury away, you know? 
[03:13:00]  It's funny, that's the amazing thing we think to ourselves, too, is when we're getting high or we're drinking, well, there's so much pressure I have to cope, which really is like, hey, look, there's a small brush fire.  Let me throw newspapers onto it.  That's the equivalent of fixing pressure by getting high or by drinking.  Any situation is made worse by drinking and doing drugs.  Like all the pressure in the world, like getting high and then hiding from the pressure is not handling it. 
[03:13:30]  It's not addressing it.  You know, we have pressure in life, David.  It's part of life.  And you're not going to just have it with your parents and you taking care of them.  You're going to have it for the rest of your life.  There's always a pressure with work or with whatever, a spouse or a girlfriend.  And you have to learn to deal with it without getting high.  I mean, it's ridiculous that you're going to put yourself in this place where it's all you have to do as far as, you know, dealing with pressure.  I completely agree. 
[03:14:00]  I agree, but, you know, I do it anyway.  You know, it's like I know better, but there's no excuse.  I'm not making any excuses.  I'm not sure I say that, man.  Have you ever gone to rehab or a meeting?  No, my dad did that shit when he was, um, I was at a lot of AA meetings growing up.  Well, why don't you, you know, whether it's AA or any other kind of program, why don't you, uh, why don't you try a meeting? 
[03:14:30]  You obviously know you have a problem and it's making your life unmanageable or unhappy.  So, why don't you do something about it?  That's, that's the first big step.  Well, you picked up the phone and, uh, you, you made a call.  My advice to you would be this.  The major problem you have now is you're using.  So, I would suggest going to a 12-step meeting of some sort and talking to people before the meeting.  Okay? 
[03:15:00]  All right.  All right.  Well, good luck, Dave.  We have other calls to get to, but, uh, that's what I would suggest doing.  Stop languishing in the place you're in and, and actually take a step.  You took a step by picking up the phone.  Now, take a step.  Go on the internet.  Look up a 12-step program of some sort and go and talk to somebody there.  It will help you a lot.  Hi, Ben.  And, by the way, the, uh, number 866-969-1969.  Taking phone calls now.  Uh, Ben in New Jersey.  Hi, Ben.  Hey, what's going on, Jim?  How are you?  Good.  Your ex, your girlfriend is texting her ex and hiding it. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, exactly, man.  I mean, I've been dating this for, like, three years.  I love her.  I consider even marrying her.  It's just this one thing that I just can't get over is that, you know, the dude she hasn't  been dating in five years, she wants to text him, like, their friends, and from time to  time, it'll get, like, a little bit, you know, a little risque in the text.  How, how do you mean, like, risque in what way?  Like, oh, what are you doing?  You're touching yourself?  Oh, yeah.  That's fucking, that's dirty.  Yeah, I mean, but it never goes past that. 
[03:16:00]  It'll never speak on the phone.  They haven't seen each other in person in, like, two years.  Right.  So, I mean, she tells me, like, hey, it's nothing.  It's, like, a little thing.  We're, like, friends.  You know, you gotta understand, I dated this guy for so many years.  How about, how about this?  Fuck that shit.  You're right.  She's, it's not just a friendship.  I'm friends with Iraq.  I've never texted him and said, are you touching yourself?  That's bullshit.  And, again, I've been in the position where I've done what she's doing.  So, I'm not coming down on her like she should be executed, but she's bullshitting herself and you. 
[03:16:30]  Here's what that is.  It's sexually intriguing on a light level.  It's keeping that little thread, that little romantic connection.  If she's with you, she's with you.  I would suggest telling her, fine, you can have this little fucking shitty thread with this guy that you can't let go, but I'm moving on.  But, I mean, everything else is perfect.  I mean, literally, I would marry this girl.  If she's telling me it means nothing, it's no big deal, how can I just sort of lay a relationship? 
[03:17:00]  If it means nothing, and it's no big deal, and it is inappropriate, why can't she just not do it?  I mean, we'll have these big talks where I'll get upset about it, you know, because I'll find a text and I'll say, you know, why can't you just cut this off?  And she'll be like, fine, I will.  And I won't see anything for, like, two months.  And then randomly he'll text her, and, you know, if she's alone, you know, sitting home late night on the couch, she can't resist, like, you know, just texting it back.  Yeah.  And then I'll find it, and it's just, she's telling me it's nothing. 
[03:17:30]  You know, why do you care?  It's really not a big deal at all.  And if I say cut it off, she does, but then, you know, a month or two later, it comes back.  She could block them, dude.  She could block them, or she could say, hey, don't text me anymore.  I'm in a relationship, and my partner's not comfortable with it.  And that's not, you're not being unreasonable, because I'm friends with my exes.  But it's different, like, if you're just, if he's like, hey, how are you?  How's work?  And we're talking, and, oh, you remember that time we went out to the thing?  And they're having genuine friend talks?  That's one thing.  But you know the difference.  You know the difference, and so does she. 
[03:18:00]  So all that fucking bullshit about, oh, what, he's just a friend.  Maybe they're not fucking.  And maybe she's not, like, talking him through a cum.  But there's something there.  You sense it.  You know it.  And that's why she's sneaky about it, because she senses it, too.  So she wants to fucking keep doing that.  It's not going to stop unless she stops it.  And if she's not willing to stop that for you, then that should tell you something.  Everything is not perfect.  I'm not saying dump her, but I would talk to her and stop being wishy-washy about it and go, look, enough of this shit. 
[03:18:30]  I'm your fucking boyfriend.  You know, you don't have to curse at her, but say I'm your boyfriend, and it's inappropriate.  Are you touching yourself?  Like, I know what that is.  Right, right, exactly.  So, you know, they shouldn't be saying anything that they wouldn't be comfortable with you seeing.  All right.  And, I mean, if I make it somewhat like an ultimatum, like, hey, you know, I can't deal with this.  You know, it's something that I would really like to have stopped.  And she chooses not to. 
[03:19:00]  At that point, it's not worth continuing the relationship.  No, why would you?  Because, again, you're not being unreasonable.  You're not being a jealous asshole who's going, don't talk to men!  Like, then I would say, fuck, dude, you've got to relax.  But I think that you're justified in being annoyed at this one.  And I think you're justified in sniffing the bullshit out that she's giving you.  Because it is bullshit.  Right.  It's nothing.  It's nothing.  And then you're finding sexually-themed texts.  You're not an idiot.  You know what that is.  Right.  Exactly.  So, I think you're on the right track by asking her not to do it. 
[03:19:30]  And I think she's being unreasonable if she won't cut it off.  Right.  Or calling me jealous for it.  I'm like, I'm not being jealous.  But maybe you are.  You know what, dude?  Maybe you are being jealous.  It's okay.  You know what?  You're in a relationship with a girl.  Well, she's saying sexual things to her ex-boyfriend and hiding it from you.  Being jealous is fairly acceptable there.  Right.  Exactly.  You know, you're not saying, you're not Jake LaMotta who's punching somebody for fucking  winking at his wife in a movie theater who he's never met.  You know, there's a difference.  I don't think you're being unreasonable. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  Thanks, man.  Okay, buddy.  Be good.  Good luck.  Chris gets off on interracial porn, but it's kind of a racist.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, Jim.  What's up?  Good, buddy.  Okay, so here's the thing.  Whenever I go out into a public setting and I see, you know, an attractive white girl,  especially a blonde girl who's with a black man, and, you know, the darker the better, 
[03:20:30]  I kind of get a feeling of disgust.  I guess it's my own prejudices.  Sure.  You know, I'm going to admit it racist.  I'll say it, but my best jerk-off sessions have been when, like, a black bull just releases  his seed in a fucking Aryan princess.  I want to know what's wrong with me.  No, I don't think there's anything wrong with you.  I mean, being a racist is, I would say that's the one you should address.  I mean, what you get off to in porn, especially if it's, you know, harmless like that, I don't  think is bad.  I think that, you know, the part about really being a racist is bad. 
[03:21:00]  But I don't know, and I don't know your real feelings, but seeing a black guy with a hot  white woman, it makes a lot of us uncomfortable, and we don't know why in a moment.  And I did a bit on this 10 years ago, and it wasn't that I hated the black guy.  It's almost like whenever I see a hot girl with anyone who's not me, it bothers me a  little bit.  Like, if I see a beautiful girl, you know, with an older guy, I'm like, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  You know, but seeing her with an older guy kind of motivates me because I know that I'll  be able to be old someday, and I make money, so maybe I can get a girl like that, but I'll 
[03:21:30]  never be able to be a black guy.  So when you see a hot chick with a black guy, you're like, that's something I can never have  her because if that's what she likes, I can never be that.  That might be a part of it, or you might just hate black people, in which case, you  know, you might want to rethink that, dude.  That's not a good way to think.  I mean, we joke, I mean, racial jokes are great.  I love a good racist joke, but to really feel that way or to really, you know, interracial  couples put up with a lot of shit.  Like, they put up with a lot of, and it's not just from white people, it's from black  people.  Believe me, both people in an interracial relationship are dealing with a lot of crap from people 
[03:22:00]  in their own group and the other group, so you don't want to push that.  But the porn, I don't think, is abnormal.  Maybe you like the taboo.  Maybe you get off on what you shouldn't, like, or what you think you shouldn't.  So, you know, the idea of the black guy fucking the white woman turns you on.  Or maybe you feel uncomfortable when you see that for real because it taps into certain  feelings you're not too comfortable with about yourself.  No, I totally agree.  And, you know, it makes me question whether or not I really am a racist, because if I 
[03:22:30]  wasn't, you know, dyed-in-the-wool racist, I wouldn't even be watching that to begin with,  like Anthony.  Probably not, yeah.  But, I mean, being a real racist, dude, you might just be thinking you're a racist because  you have certain prejudices or certain feelings that you might want to, you know, tweak a  little bit.  A real racist is a guy that absolutely does not like members of the opposite race and  thinks they're better than, for real, thinks they're better than people from the other race.  You know, and that's just, you know, that's just a shitty, irrational way to think. 
[03:23:00]  Hmm.  Well, I'm still stuck with this conundrum.  Yeah, well, I mean, I don't think the porn is your problem.  I would just really think long and hard about why it is, what your weird feelings about black  guys and white women is.  Who cares when you think about it?  Who cares?  Just another hot chick that's not going to fuck you, dude.  Like, would you rather just see her with an athlete?  What's the difference?  Or would you rather see her with a lawyer?  Like, if she's not fucking you, who cares who she's fucking?  I mean, it's not that his, because he's black will piss him off. 
[03:23:30]  It's just the, you know, the negative culture of crime.  Oh, stop.  Who cares about that?  That doesn't mean anything when you see a chick with a guy.  Like, I don't think about what culture.  If I see a girl with a fucking, an Iranian, what do you think?  I care about Iranian politics?  She's not fucking me.  That's what annoys me.  And a lot of times we, you know, we just get jealous when we see pretty women with other  other people.  And with a black guy, it's just so obvious because they're so different than you.  So you take it, like, as an indictment. 
[03:24:00]  Like, oh, she has rejected me as a white man.  Instead of realizing, like, if she's with a really good-looking black guy who's got washboard  abs, why shouldn't she fuck him?  Like, what have I done to earn that piece of ass when I'm mushy and I just finally don't  have tits anymore?  This guy's going to fucking wash it.  Who am I going to fuck?  Am I going to fuck a really hot black chick or a 230-pound white girl?  I'm going to fuck the hot black girl.  Put yourself in her shoes, dude.  Put yourself in her shoes.  Or heels, as it were.  All right? 
[03:24:30]  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Oh, thank you so much, Jeff.  All right.  Good luck, brother.  And, you know, I mean, look, what we get off on is, it is what it is.  I mean, you know, I mean, Adam and Eve wants to know if you're getting enough in the bedroom.  I mean, obviously the white girl, she's fucking a black guy.  She's probably getting more than enough.

[03:26:00]  They really are a great site.  They have, you know, there's a lot of porn out there, but Adam Eve kind of has all of  your adult needs, and they are genuinely a great site for people like us.  And I say us.  If you're listening to this show, chances are you're garbage, and I appreciate that.  All right, let's see.  Matt, sister's in an abusive relationship.  Hello, Matt.  How are you?  Pretty good.  So your sister's in a physically abusive relationship?  Yeah.  Is she married to the guy? 
[03:26:30]  No.  It's the guy she's been with for a couple years.  She's left him quite a few times, had him arrested a few times.  No one in the family or any of our friends likes the guy.  Right.  Are you scared of him?  Physically, no.  I'm scared of trying to do anything because I don't, you know, want to have a follow-up  between me and my sister as well.  Well, does your sister want to get out of the relationship? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  She's tried over and over.  It lasts a couple days, and he just finds his way back to her place and acts like he's  getting the thing, sits down, never leaves.  Why is she drawn to this guy?  I have no idea.  She has two kids with him.  One just turned a year, and the other one about a month and a half old.  Well, has she, I mean, why does she keep getting back with him? 
[03:27:30]  I have no idea.  I don't know if it's a mental thing or what.  Well, you should ask her that because a part of her, I mean, for someone to leave an abusive  relationship, they have to want to leave the abusive relationship.  And I know that as family members, we can talk to them and we can tell them what we  want to tell them.  But as an adult, it's kind of hard to make somebody want to leave a situation that they  should want to leave.  Like, again, I'm careful to give advice about this when it comes to stalkerish spouses or  boyfriends.  Because a lot of times, men do not react violently. 
[03:28:00]  But there are times when they do, and there are ways to leave those relationships.  And I don't know if I'm qualified, because I don't know their situation, to say what the  best thing for her to do is.  For you, I would suggest talking to her and being supportive and telling her, look, if you  need anything, or maybe would you let her come and stay with you?  Do you live near her?  She lives with my other sister a couple blocks away.  Does she live with the guy? 
[03:28:30]  She doesn't want him there, but like I said, he does just show up and he just won't leave.  And she's called the police on him?  Yeah, last time, about a week ago, had my uncle over there, and they got into it.  He ended up knocking him out and having the cops haul him off to jail.  Oh, he knocked out the boyfriend?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I don't know why she's still drawn to this asshole.  The uncle is her father.  Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, her uncle.  Okay, you're her sister.  She's his sister.  I don't know.  She has to want to leave the relationship, dude.  If she really wants to leave it, you know, she can't keep letting this guy back into her 
[03:29:00]  life.  But there's...  I think she does, but it's just, she's scared of, you know...  I know.  You know what you might want to do, and I really mean this.  You might want to talk to someone in a woman's shelter or one of those places who has  much more experience, because there are ways to leave abusive relationships.  She's not doomed into this thing forever, but as somebody who's never been involved in  one, I don't have experience in that.  I would suggest talking to somebody who is involved in some sort of a shelter who has dealt 
[03:29:30]  with this time and time and time again and seeing all the patterns and seeing all of  the traps that people fall into, because there are ways to get out.  But when you have kids, there's some kind of a...  Like, should she get the restraining order and should she enforce it?  You know, again, as a novice, I would suggest, of course, a restraining order and then enforce  it.  Every time he shows up, call the cops.  But there are times in very dangerous situations where that just escalates things to a bad place. 
[03:30:00]  So, I don't know which of those situations that is.  Right.  And they've had a restraining order on each other before and they've...  Why?  Is she abusive to him or no?  No.  Oh, God.  So, I'm sorry, buddy.  I just closed down my window.  Cocksucker.  Sorry.  I would literally suggest...  I said literally there, but I shouldn't have.  Talk to someone in a woman's shelter.  Who has she spoken to to get out of it for help?  Facebook.  Facebook?  Out there for the world, yeah. 
[03:30:30]  That's bullshit.  She's got to...  She's got to talk to somebody besides Facebook.  She has to go and talk to somebody who's a counselor, who has experience.  You know, she has to talk to somebody who knows what they're doing.  All right?  Right.  I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.  I just don't want to pretend to know something I don't know.  No, you're plenty of help.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  I apologize.  Okay.  All right.  Be good and good luck.  That's it.  And again, I wish I had a better answer for that guy.  Um, thank you. 
[03:31:00]  Uh, and by the way, I apologize for being distracted yet.  I closed down the window with all the calls on it.  Do we have to have these fucking...  Everything's got a passcode to think.  God sucker.  Everything here has a bunch of different administration passwords.  Well, can't they just leave it for us?  It's supposed to be saved in there, but I don't know why it keeps erasing.  All right.  Whatever.  Uh, let's talk to Tony.  He's a wife.  He's not attracted to him.  Hi, Tony.  How are you, buddy?  Good.  How are you?  Uh, fantastic.  Uh, I'm with this girl.  She's common law with me. 
[03:31:30]  Okay.  She's 37 years old.  I met her when she was 30.  Uh, we have a three-year-old child together.  Uh, and, you know, for the past year, I've been staying on the couch.  Okay.  She's telling me she's not in love with me no more.  She's not attracted to me.  I found out that she had an affair with a doctor at her job.  She's a nurse.  And I couldn't really say anything because, you know, we were just cohabitating. 
[03:32:00]  And, uh, you know, she goes from hot to cold.  Two nights ago, she's hugging, kissing me.  And then yesterday, you know, get away from me.  Please don't bother me.  Okay.  Just don't even look at me.  Have you put a lot of weight on or anything?  No.  You know what, Jimmy?  From this, I lost 40 pounds in a month.  Okay.  And, uh, you know, I just don't know what to do.  I love my family.  I love my daughter.  Okay.  I just don't know what to do. 
[03:32:30]  And maybe this will give you a little more insight.  I'm 57.  She's 37.  Okay.  Um, maybe that's part of it.  But the reality is, now that this is, it is what it is.  Um, where she feels the way she feels.  Be that right or wrong.  Do you want to be in a situation where you have to deal with this hot and cold bullshit  when you're not doing anything wrong?  Like, you probably feel trapped because you're 57.  Like, oh, where am I going to go?  Where am I going to find another her?  But, like, what do you really want to do?  There's a million websites and match.com and all that stuff. 
[03:33:00]  Do you want to be trapped with this person who's giving you this fucking bullshit at this  point in your life?  You know, Jimmy, I, I, I, you're 100% correct.  And no, I don't.  And I'll be honest with you.  I don't know if it's love or lust that keeps, it keeps the attraction there.  Okay.  I, I, you know, I, I just don't understand it.  I really don't.  And I'm, I'm really, really going insane here trying to figure this out, you know?  Well, why figure it out?  It doesn't matter.  The reality is, like, it's probably more lust or probably you're hurt. 
[03:33:30]  And it's hard to walk away.  I'm not saying it's easy, but she's not treating you right.  She had an affair, uh, with a doctor.  She's, uh, hot and cold.  Makes you sleep on the couch in your own house?  What do you, yes, for a year I've been on the couch.  Why would you tolerate that?  You see that, that's what I don't know.  And I think it's the unknown and the insecurity I have because of my age.  Okay, and then she keeps texting me.  Tony, we're almost there.  We just need a little more time. 
[03:34:00]  I need some space.  I need a little more time.  Well, maybe that does happen.  Maybe people do need space.  Have you tried couple counseling?  Uh, no, she refuses that.  Ah, fuck her.  You know what, dude?  I fucking hate her.  Um, she, she won't go to counseling.  If she said, hey, let's go to counseling and talk this through, that's a willingness.  She just wants you on the fucking couch until she makes a decision.  Hey, hey, shithead, go lay out there.  I'm going to do what I want to do.  No regard for your feelings.  Am I going to go, uh, to counseling?  Nah, not at all. 
[03:34:30]  I'll just work through it while you sit out there and suffer.  Not one ounce of regard for how you're dealing with this or you're feeling.  That, you know, if she was willing to go to counseling, I'd say, hey, that's a great thing.  But if she's not, uh, I think you have every right to be fucking disgusted.  You know what, Jimmy?  You just satisfied me, okay?  Because the thoughts you just had were my sentiments exactly.  And, you know, I feel like I'm a puppet on a string that she could pull me and push me away whenever she wants.  And I'm an old school guy. 
[03:35:00]  I don't need that nonsense.  You're right, Jimmy.  Dude, if you're 57, you're not 80.  You could have literally, you could live to be another fucking, uh, 25, 30, 40 years.  Like, people live to be 90 nowadays.  What, are you going to put up with this for 30 more fucking years?  Just go.  Like, I know that that's easier said than done.  But I think you've done what you were supposed to do.  You've done your part.  And there's a time where you just got to say, I'm not going to put up with this fucking idiocy anymore.  And you know what's the worst part, Jimmy, is the house we have, we bought four years ago. 
[03:35:30]  So, I gave her $70,000 to put down on the house.  The house is under her name.  Oh, boy.  I don't have it on the mind.  So, I'm, I'm, she's telling me, you got to get out, you got to get an apartment.  I'm getting kicked out of my own fucking home.  Now, why is she comfortable doing that?  You see, this is what I don't understand.  This is the part that keeps me there because I'm trying to get into her psyche and see what the fuck is going on.  Wait a minute.  Now, why can't you have the house in your name, too?  Uh, because I had some, some shit going on in the past. 
[03:36:00]  Okay.  I quit happy.  Okay.  But that puts her in a much better position than you.  Oh, of course.  Of course.  Would she be fair-minded and sell the house?  Of course not.  No, no, no.  No.  But she still needs me to do work in the house.  Two weeks ago, I spent $4,500 on a driveway.  Well, I think you should stop being a victim and fucking move it along.  I really do.  I mean, look, if you have to eat the $70,000, that's a tall order.  That's a lot of money.  But what are you going to do?  You're still on the couch. 
[03:36:30]  What are you going to do?  Just be on her fucking couch?  Maybe it's just time to move on and get on with your life, dude.  I think she sounds awful.  Yeah.  You know what, Jimmy?  You're right.  Okay?  The way I found this one, I just want to get validation from you.  Good luck, brother.  Good luck.  Hey, thanks so much, Jimmy.  You have a great day.  Thanks for the call, man.  Take care.  Yes, girl.  Chris in Queens, girl advice.  Girl walked out on you six months ago and won't answer your phone calls.  Okay.  Hi, Chris.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you doing?  Good, buddy.  How long were you with her? 
[03:37:00]  Like three years, and she lived with me for like a year and a half.  And she walked out on you six months ago for what?  Uh, well, way long ago, early in the relationship, I had cheat on her once.  Okay.  It was early in the relationship.  She found out about it through the girl on Facebook.  She could never get over it.  I tried to do everything I could.  She claimed to be over it.  I worked my ass off and treated her like a queen, and everything seemed fine.  But then the last six months we were together, she got distant and cold. 
[03:37:30]  And as much as I tried, like, she couldn't seem to get as close to me as she used to be.  Okay.  And then one day she's just up and tells me, uh, I'm going back to my dad's house in a week.  And I'm like, well, if you feel you need to do that, then do it.  I'm not going to fight or argue.  I just hope we can still be friends and try and, you know, see whatever happens.  And so she just up and left saying, we're going to be friends, all this stuff.  We were good.  And then just would not see me after that. 
[03:38:00]  Okay.  Well, she wanted out of the relationship.  Yeah.  She wanted out.  She was texting me and talking about, oh, he's kind, this and that.  So she still remained friends with her, like, first boyfriend, like the love of her life who, uh, who ended up being gay and cheating on her with her other friend.  But again, that's, dude, I understand that that would hurt.  That's painful to think about.  But that has nothing to do with your situation.  Like, when we find out shit other people are doing with other people, like, those situations are sometimes a little different. 
[03:38:30]  It might have been easier for her to fucking swallow the fact, all right, the guy was gay.  At least he cheated on me with a guy and there's nothing I could have done about that.  Maybe you were the second one and you hurt more because you make her doubt herself as a woman.  If someone's gay, they're gay.  But, you know, you're a guy who likes women and she wasn't enough for you.  For whatever reason, she's answering you.  You just don't like the answer she's giving you.  If you're calling her and she's not answering your calls and she's not returning your calls and she's cut off contact, it's very painful, but she is giving you an answer.  And the only thing to do for your own sanity is to accept that answer. 
[03:39:00]  It's never good to continue hounding somebody because she's going to wind up, if she doesn't hate you now, she might just be mad at you or need time.  She's going to hate your guts for it and you're going to come off as a stalker or a nudge.  I think that might have already came off as that a little bit.  Like, I haven't gone to see her.  Like, she said she needed a space.  I gave her a space, but I did keep texting her and that was annoying her.  Eventually, she stopped responding, but I haven't, like, gone to see her at her house at all. 
[03:39:30]  But the thing is, like, I feel like it's been so long.  Like, I just want to see her and see how she reacts.  Yeah, exactly.  See, again, I just want to, I just want to.  Like, I understand that.  But the bottom line is, she doesn't want to.  And I, believe me, know where you're coming from.  And I know it's, I just want to, we keep looking for the perfect sign-off.  Even when we know it's over, we want the perfect send-off.  Like, when we feel like all business is completed, my hands are washed of it. 
[03:40:00]  That's what we're looking for in these situations a lot of times.  Like, I think deep down you probably know it's over.  But you want to be able to walk away and go, ah, okay.  And a lot of times there is no absolute 100% perfect sign-off.  Where it feels completed and it feels done and finished and okay.  Sometimes you have to go, she left and it sucks and there's some unsaid things and tough shit.  You got to swallow that and move on.  Because she's giving you the answer.  She doesn't want to be in the relationship. 
[03:40:30]  Whether that's right or wrong, I don't, you know, who cares.  Yeah, but I was like, she talked about, like, she was everything.  She's my only friend.  She talked about how we would stay friends no matter what.  But again, if you want to be, you're not looking to be friends with her.  You and I both know you want the relationship.  So don't.  I'm not really sure of that.  I have a new girlfriend.  But I think, like, I just want a little bit of closure and friendship.  See, closure.  There's, well, I just was talking about that.  The closure that we think, you have closure. 
[03:41:00]  Closure is she's not getting back to you.  The door is closed.  And yet, you keep trying to reopen it.  What you want to do is reopen the door and close it on your terms.  You don't like the fact that she's closed the door.  You have closure.  She was never a nasty person.  But as soon as this happened, she's calling to me.  She's putting up pictures on her Twitter of her in my bed, like, with, you know, like, in my house and stuff like that.  And then, like, I had to send her an email to remove it. 
[03:41:30]  And instead of just doing that, she's like, oh, can somebody tell me how to block email?  Why do you fucking keep contacting her?  Just block her on Twitter.  No, no.  Block her on Twitter.  So you don't have to see.  Why would you follow your ex on Twitter?  Block her on Twitter.  And then fucking get on with your life.  You got a new girl.  Stop pretending you want to be friends with her.  You want to open the door.  If you want to be friends with her, respect her wishes.  That's what a friend would do.  If she's ready, someday she'll come back around. 
[03:42:00]  If she's not, that's how it is.  And I know that that's shitty to hear.  But for your own sanity and your own new relationship, stop bullshitting yourself and saying you want friendship.  You don't.  You want to close the door on your own terms.  Accept the fact that the door is closed.  It's okay, brother.  It happens to all of us.  We all get to close it on our own sometimes.  And then there's times where other people close it for us and we don't like it.  Yeah.  There's a scene in The Mighty Quinn with Denzel Washington where the guy's ex-girlfriend got pregnant. 
[03:42:30]  He goes, what am I supposed to do?  And Denzel Washington says, live with it.  And that's what you got to do.  You got to live with it.  Move on and realize the door is closed.  Fuck it.  Even if you did get to reopen it and then close it on your terms.  Who gives a shit, dude?  You know what I mean?  It doesn't make anything different.  Yeah.  All right?  All right.  Thanks, sweetheart.  All right.  Good luck, you little petunia.  All right.  Doug in Boston. 
[03:43:00]  Hi, Doug.  Yes, Jimmy.  You think you have a sex addiction and you want to talk about the app called Stumblr?  I don't know that app.  Oh, dude.  I'm not sure if you're still having issues with it.  Sure.  Yes, I am.  All right.  Well, it's one you might want to stay away from.  I don't know if it's on the iPhone, but it's an Android app.  And what it does is it condenses all the Tumblr sites.  You're familiar with Tumblr, right?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[03:43:30]  So, and what it does is it just, there's no bullshit comments.  It's just a gazillion porno pictures from everything from, you know, self shots to GIFs and everything else.  And as soon as you click on a picture, then there's a whole row of things you can click on on the bottom to find other sites that show you the same thing.  And, I mean, I am obsessed.  It's crazy. 
[03:44:00]  I mean, I'm like, you know, edging all day long.  Well, I understand the addiction and what you're saying, because Stumblr is just the vehicle you're using.  It's like being an alcoholic and saying, I'm drinking vodka, and then another guy calls it, I'm drinking whiskey.  It's the same thing as, you know, whatever it is you're doing, it's obviously making your life unmanageable and you're aware of it.  What you might want to do, if you want to stop doing it, again, the suggestion I would give, which I should take for myself, 12-step meetings.  Because they do work.  When I'm doing well, and I'm remaining abstinent, and I'm doing meetings, and I'm doing really good with the porn, I sleep better, I feel better about myself, I have more energy, I concentrate on shit, my life is better. 
[03:44:30]  It's just trying to commit to the fact that there's this other, you know, I mean, I'm already a borderline alcoholic and a drug addict, and it's just now, the sex thing just doesn't seem like a real, it's not the same, I don't know.  It's not what?  It's not the same, it doesn't, I would have a real problem saying, listen, I'm addicted to sex, I don't know. 
[03:45:00]  Okay, maybe you're not at that point where your life is unmanageable, or as they say, sick and tired of being sick and tired, where you're ready to admit and accept that you have an addiction, but I think that you're getting to the point, because you're edging, dude, you're edging, and you're spending hours doing this, and I guarantee you there's times where you're doing it where you're not even horny, you're just doing this, let me see the new ones that are posted, you know, you're just that hard, you don't need to come, but you're like, let me just zone out and see the new ones that are posted, like, I understand the mania of that. 
[03:45:30]  I understand that, I understand that, and that is addictive behavior, it's like the times when we're not hungry and we just eat anyway to do something, that's only going to continue, and if you don't feel you're at that point right now, how about this, give yourself some time away from it, delete the app, you can always get it back, the thing with sex addiction, with porn and all this shit, it's always going to be there. 
[03:46:00]  It's not like when I delete this porn, I'll never be able to get it again, pornography will always be available, jerking off is always available, so you're not losing it, so if you feel like, oh my god, give yourself a little break and see how you feel, try that.  See, if you don't think you're addicted, stop jerking off for, give yourself 30 days without jerking off.  But hey, why not, if you're not addicted to it, a lot of people go a month without jerking off in adult life, dude, they're busy, they got the bills to pay, give yourself two weeks without jerking off, just see if you can do it. 
[03:46:30]  And don't lie to yourself, don't rub your dick through your pants, delete the app and give yourself some fucking time.  See how you do.  Hey, listen to me, I want to tell you, man, you have found your calling.  I really hope that, I know you're looking to get a talk show, and I would suggest that not just the interviews, but show some of this stuff from the show, put that on your reel as well. 
[03:47:00]  Thank you, brother, I appreciate it.  Thank you, good luck, man, okay?  All right, thank you, pal.  And it's like, I feel very bad for a guy, he's here in New York named Mr. C.  He's a DJ, a legendary guy, I think he was Big Daddy Kane's DJ, Mr. C, and he's on Hot 97, or you know, he was on Power 105, he's on Hot 97.  And, you know, apparently he was soliciting sex from a transvestite or a crossdresser or a drag queen, I'm not sure what this person classifies himself as. 
[03:47:30]  But there's been, like, I think an arrest for a transsexual blowjob he got, or he's been arrested for hitting on undercover cops who are men.  So this, again, I don't know Mr. C, I've never met him.  But he resigned, and, you know, in hip-hop, I guess that's weird, it's different.  Like, I could talk about transsexuals, and I don't care if people like it.  I don't care if I lose fans, I don't give up, because, whatever, don't like me.  But hip-hop's a different world than that.  They have to have a tough image, and comics can be vulnerable, it's a little easier. 
[03:48:00]  So I feel really bad for this guy that he had to resign.  I don't know if he's gay.  I don't know if he's married and has a wife, I don't know if he's bisexual, I don't know if he's straight and just has a tremendous demon to the, I don't know.  But I feel really bad for this guy that we still live in a place where he had to step aside and give up a gig that he's really good at.  He's a legitimate DJ, and he's a contributor, musically.  And he had to step aside, or he chose to step aside because of this dumb shit.  You know, maybe it's the fact that he's soliciting sex, but I don't know why the station wouldn't stand behind him, unless they figured that this is what he wants. 
[03:48:30]  But I just would hope people would support this guy.  And again, I don't tell fans how to react.  Hey, go to this guy's Twitter.  I don't do that.  It's not my business or my place to tell you how to feel.  But I would just, if you feel inclined, hey, if you want to badmouth him, do that too.  But if you feel inclined to support this guy, I think you should because, you know, it's just sad to me that we live in this world where this guy's not a pedophile. 
[03:49:00]  You know what I mean?  He's not fucking children or animals.  And there's such shame around this sexual stuff, which is really not that bad.  We should try to get him on.  Yeah, I don't think he'd come on right now.  I mean, they said one of his tweets I read, he's like, I don't even know if I should be alive.  He's hurting badly right now.  And it's just, ah, man, I feel terrible for the guy.  So hopefully he's going to be okay and get his gig back.  Because, you know, he should only leave that job if he's fucking doing payola, which is illegal, or if he sucks at his job, you know, or if he's a rapist. 
[03:49:30]  But he's none of those things.  He's a good DJ, and I feel bad that he had to give up a gig for that.  Let's see.  All right, let's go to Brian in New Jersey, something a little lighter.  Hi, Brian.  Stand-up comedy advice?  Hey, Jim, what's going on?  Thanks for the call.  Yeah, so, like, I'm doing stand-up.  I've been doing stand-up, like, open mic.  Here's my advice.  Always say cunt!  Okay, I'm kidding.  What's up, buddy?  What's the question?  No, I mean, like, my mom's just, like, always getting on me.  Like, I'm trying to get, like, a job, like, to support myself. 
[03:50:00]  How old are you?  I'm 22 right now.  Good, good, good.  Yeah, so I just graduated college.  I'm trying to get a job to support myself.  But, like, my mom, she's just always busting my balls about, like, doing, like, being out late in the city, like, doing open mic.  Sure.  Like, not, like, getting a job.  So, like, I don't know.  I feel like I have to choose between, like, I have to get, like, a job that I hate where I'm stuck behind a desk and just doing something I don't like and doing stand-up.  And I'm trying to, like, find, like, I don't know, an even balance, but I don't know if I think that's something I probably need to just find in myself, you know? 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, of course.  And there's no absolute with this.  Like, my parents were very supportive, but so many comedians will listen to you right now and go, oh, fuck, dude, that's the same thing.  Like, a lot of parents go, get a real job, like, long into your career.  If you have to get a job to pay the bills, sometimes, you know, there is a reality.  We have the fucking phone bill and all this rent.  You have to get a gig.  Try to find one that is compatible with stand-up time where you work maybe fucking, you know, 10 to 6 or whatever or just be tired for a while. 
[03:51:00]  But it's not an absolute, right?  You don't have to make a decision now that will forever impact you.  You can get a temporary job and continue doing stand-up.  But I would say if stand-up is your dream, I was 21 when I started.  You're 22.  If you're out there and you're doing it, there is a risk with a dream.  And if you're already in it, you've already done more than a lot of people ever do. 
[03:51:30]  The majority of people always think about it and never try it.  So if you found the courage and the moral fucking fortitude to start it, I would suggest not stopping because you've already gotten past the hardest part, which is the beginning.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I started when I was 19.  Oh, good.  And I had two open mics.  You know, and like my friend, he's got a show at the Creek in the Cave.  Okay.  And he's going to put me on soon, too, which is like awesome.  You know, but he gave up a lot.  He was homeless. 
[03:52:00]  He started selling cocaine.  Like, I don't want that.  I don't want that life.  You don't have to.  Yeah.  His story is not your story.  You know what I mean?  I didn't have to do that either.  Colin Quinn has his story.  Robert Kelly has it.  We all have our path.  And you don't look at a worst-case scenario.  This guy had to eat another man's ass to get a gig.  Like, you know, it's not going to always be that way for us.  Just follow your path, dude.  You've got to find a gig.  Just get a little bit of money.  I worked a civilian job, quote-unquote.  Probably the first two years I did stand-up, the first three. 
[03:52:30]  No.  I was five years sober.  So, yeah, the first two years I did it, but I got unemployment for a couple years.  But it was hard.  I was tired in the morning.  I sucked at my day job, but I knew I was following my dreams.  So I would suggest that.  Follow the fucking dream that you have and get yourself a day job just to pay the bills for now.  Just for now.  Okay.  Thanks a lot, Jimmy.  I appreciate it.  Good luck, Brian.  Thank you, man.  I just saw it in general, and it was great.  Thanks a lot, man.  I appreciate that for another comedian. 
[03:53:00]  Good luck, brother.  All right.  Have a good one.  Take care.  I think we're running out of time, Yorick.  Yeah.  A couple of minutes.  A couple of minutes.  Let's see.  How about we'll do one more quick one, and we've got to do it.  I apologize to the guys I didn't get to.  Jason in Arizona.  Your wife let them have a threesome with her best friend.  Now she wants a three-way with another guy.  Uh-oh.  We have to be quick, buddy.  Now, do you not want it with another guy?  You know, I'm as straight as they come.  I'm a firefighter.  If I did that, the guys at the station would let me have shit. 
[03:53:30]  How would they know?  How would they know?  Well, because we're open books.  I can't hold shit, and I already spilled if you want it, so now they're giving me shit every day.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  So you don't have to suck the guy's dick.  There's plenty of totally straight guys that have threesomes.  I agree, but if my balls touch his balls, I don't know if I could look in the mirror the next day.  Well, that's not what you have to do, then.  You have to work it where she sucks your cock while he fucks her, or she sucks his...  There's ways, dude, in a threesome.  I had my dick in a girl's mouth while Ron Jeremy fucked her. 
[03:54:00]  Our dicks weren't within fucking...  Well, they were actually within two inches of each other inside because of Ron's size.  But there's no reason your dicks have to touch at all.  You can have a 100% heterosexual threesome with a girl.  Believe me, I've done them.  You know, if it was just a girlfriend, I would probably be open, but the fact that it's my wife makes it a little harder.  But like I say, she did this for me, so I feel like a hypocrite.  I don't know.  Well, did you discuss it before and promise it to her before?  Absolutely not.  Okay, well, then you're not being a hypocrite. 
[03:54:30]  But you can't, if two people do something, and you can't just all of a sudden at the end go,  well, hey, now it's got to be this way because that wasn't discussed before.  Fuck the firehouse, dude.  You guys can have a...  I'm an open book, too, but there's things I'm private with.  You can have privacy in your life and still consider yourself an open, honest couple.  My suggestion would be, if you really feel it's going to hurt you, once you see something, you can never unsee it.  And I would seriously talk to her and say, look, right now this is something I can't do.  I love you. 
[03:55:00]  We don't have to do it with your best friend again, but this is a little too hard for me.  Yeah, well, perhaps we can find a small-cost Jewish gentleman or something.  Yeah, feel free to do that.  I mean, you know, there's plenty of them that would be happy to do it.  But do not do it if it's going to hurt the marriage, because that could be a fucking cancer that eats away at you guys.  And it sounds like you have a good thing.  Don't fuck it up, all right?  Yeah, I hear you.  Thank you.  I love you.  Good luck, buddy.  Thank you.  Our last call, thank you, man.  And Adam and Eve, a great, great friend to this show, they want to know if you guys are getting enough in the bedroom.

And you're like, foot, foot, foot, foot. 
[03:56:30]  And you've got to spit.  Then your fucking spit starts to smell like dry breath.  Anything else your heart desires, you can get the one thing.
