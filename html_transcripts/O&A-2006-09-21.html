<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, calling themselves various offensive names and joking about their numerous potential arrests.  A recurring, nonsensical bit, "Where is Hakim? Take me to the Waldorf Astoria," punctuated their rambling discussion about traffic and foreign policy, which they deemed hilariously funny.  Opie then revealed he’d been homeless for over two months, living in hotels and a cockroach- and mouse-infested apartment, detailing the struggles of moving a large mattress and the inexplicable rejection from a co-op board despite his excellent finances, leading to speculation about the rejection being due to his fame.  The real estate agent and even the celebrity seller were also reportedly upset.  The conversation shifted to space debris and the difficulties of finding apartments in New York City, with Opie expressing increasing dislike for the city.

A substantial portion of the show focused on promoting the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, encouraging overweight women to come to the studio for a weigh-in and a chance to win $10 per pound (with potential increases via listener donations).  The rules, prizes, and the contest's name were discussed at length, alongside a sexually suggestive and offensive pre-recorded message. A caller, Trevor, offered a possible explanation for Opie’s co-op rejection, suggesting a building code violation by the seller.  Another caller, Sarah, confirmed her participation.  The hosts also discussed the bizarre sale of Anna Nicole Smith's son's photos and remains.  A caller, Angel, pledged to participate in "Fatty Pig Fatty," claiming a weight of 355 pounds.  The hosts debated the logistics and bonus prizes for bikini participation, utilizing sexually suggestive language throughout.

The show also included a MacBook contest featuring listener-submitted audio entries, some deemed "interesting" (implying poor quality), and one containing racist and violent language.  A heated debate ensued with Don from Overeaters Anonymous, criticizing the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest as promoting obesity, countered by Jen, another caller, who defended the contest and her enjoyment of her weight.  A disastrous phone interview with musician Blowfly and his manager, "Uncle Tom," followed, marked by Blowfly's constant interruptions with unintelligible rapping and sexually explicit lyrics, leading to angry emails exchanged between the parties.  The hosts also reviewed listener-submitted audio for another contest, playing several local news bloopers and further promoting the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, this time featuring Sarah from Queens as the first contestant, weighed and interviewed live on-air.  The segment included additional crude and sexually suggestive humor, sparked by a caller's story about seeing two midgets driving.  Darkly humorous commentary on news stories about a kitten beheading and a baby dying after falling into its mother's vomit also featured.

The broadcast continued with a sexually explicit monologue focused on "Patty," followed by a discussion of Tiger Woods and a photo, including racially charged comments. The show also covered "mancations," with speculation about sex and prostitutes, using vulgar language, and featuring listener anecdotes. A heated phone call from a building owner to an elevator repair company with profane complaints and threats ensued. Further promotion of "Fatty Pig Fatty" occurred, with a caller discussing potential physical altercations. The show featured a discussion of Jim McGreevey's Oprah interview and his homosexuality, with sexually explicit and offensive language. Multiple callers participated, adding their own comments and stories throughout.

The show also covered McGreevey's memoir in detail, reading excerpts aloud and interjecting with sexually explicit commentary and jokes, focusing on graphic details of McGreevey's sexual encounters. Callers offered reactions and competed for “line of the day” with crude remarks. One caller recounted McGreevey’s difficult child conception.  The hosts brainstormed ways to destroy a Tickle Me Elmo toy on camera. The show concluded with promotion of their upcoming live broadcast in Cleveland, briefly mentioning a potential "foaming pussy" stunt and interaction with women promoting a TV show.  The hosts also discussed ticket prices for their Cleveland show and the economic state of Cleveland.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts repeatedly promoted their upcoming live show in Cleveland. A horse mask made a brief appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202, featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  In the country, creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long!  Shut up!  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined. 
[00:00:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know, I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead!  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Where is Hakim? 
[00:01:30]  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  Yeah.  Uh, where is Hakim?  Where is Hakim?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria. 
[00:02:00]  Where is Hakim?  Where is Hakim?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  What a complete fool.  You got to hear the whole report though.  So that's what's happening, but the big story is traffic, Pat.  You know, and every time I think of the Waldorf Astoria and I think of world leaders, I think  of world leaders, I think of coming to America when James Earl Jones came to see, to find 
[00:02:30]  Eddie Murphy.  And he's like, where is Hakim?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  And that's where I guess the presidents get, so where else would you meet with world leaders  other than the Waldorf Astoria?  That's right.  Yeah.  Foreign policy for the masses, I guess it is, Roger, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you've boiled it all down.  Presidents are busy with meetings.  Waldorf Astoria is a good place to be. 
[00:03:00]  Chock full of information.  And, of course, we know the traffic restrictions, but we're going to put all this traffic information  on our website as well because there's a lot to take care of.  Yeah.  Roger, thank you.  And there you have it.  Oh, did he sell his buddy Roger down the river or what?  He didn't know what to do with that though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The greatest news improv ever.  I don't think we'll ever beat that one.  That one was just over the top.  And with that, we say good morning. 
[00:03:30]  We say good morning.  Shuttle Atlantis giving me go for deorbit return and burn.  Here they come.  Oh, boy.  Roll the dice.  Roll the dice.  Time to roll the dice again.  Did some of that floating space junk knock into him?  Leave a little ding.  Stupid humans.  We can't even go up into space without worrying about things banging into us.  Banging into us like I'm up there.  Banging into the space shuttle.  The space shuttle. 
[00:04:00]  We used to be real good at it.  We used to know what happened.  Well, we used to be, you know, not going up there as often so there wasn't as much garbage.  That's true.  Now there's garbage that could just bang off your space shuttle.  Yeah, now they don't know what any of it is either.  They take pictures of it and go, well, this is something floating out there, but not a clue.  Well, if we first started going up there, it seemed like a good idea.  Ah, throw a little trash out there.  Who cares?  I mean, how many times are we really going to go up here?  Earth is huge.  Right.  Yeah.  Are we going to bump into it?  But, you know, we ruined that now, too. 
[00:04:30]  It's floating around like cigarette butts on the street.  Now there's just an orbit of garbage.  You've got to dodge on your way in.  There you go.  All right.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Good morning.  And it's spreading across my lungs.  And we've got to be in Cleveland tomorrow.  We've got the ONA traveling virus on Saturday.  My left side of my throat hurts now.  Like, I get back once in a while, too.  Really?  Yeah, at the air conditioning, I think.  My throat isn't as bad anymore.  Now it's just drip, drip, drip, drip, drip out of my nose as I'm trying to sleep last 
[00:05:00]  night.  Drip, drip, drip.  And then I took one of those, you know, those over-the-counter cold medicines that should  just be banned.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable what that crap does to you.  Yeah, drug dealers could sell those pills.  Absolutely.  They get you a woozy.  So I was in a haze all night long, you know, you're falling asleep.  No, you're not.  You're falling asleep.  No, you're not.  Oh, wait.  This time I think I'm falling asleep.  No, you're not.  Yeah, it gets you.  All night long. 
[00:05:30]  All night long.  It gets you a woozy, but then you can't fall asleep.  What's that about?  It's like speed.  I don't get that.  Like, you're falling asleep.  You feel yourself falling asleep, but your body's saying, no, you can't sleep.  Don't sleep.  Don't sleep.  Don't sleep.  Don't sleep.  Don't sleep.  My recommendation?  Take more.  Yeah?  I don't know.  It was a thorough flu.  Oh, it was one of these where this is a brilliant idea.  You cook up in tea?  No, it was a pill form, but it's pretty brilliant.  They have the day version and the night version all in one package. 
[00:06:00]  Oh.  So I took the night version.  Oh, I thought you made a mistake.  No, no, no.  I took the night version, you know, and I went to bed around, did I say night virgin?  Virgin?  The night version.  Virgin.  Uh, around 8, 830 and crashed.  Crapped out.  I got a living update.  Oh, oh, oh.  I got a living update.  Been homeless for a while.  Yeah, for the new listeners.  Um, I've been homeless for, uh, somewhere around July 4th, middle of July, somewhere in there. 
[00:06:30]  So over two months, wait, over two months, I've been living in hotels and also crashing  in the apartment that's unlivable from time to time to break it up.  Cause that's where all my stuff is with the black mold.  Well, the mold I guess is, uh, out of the basement.  I don't know.  Sure it is.  I don't know.  I'm not living down there anymore.  So behind the walls.  So all my stuff is up in the living room.  Um, what else can I tell the folks about my place?  The fact that I've killed over 30 mice. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Uh, cockroaches from time to time and two major floods in the basement where I used to sleep,  which chased me, you know, above ground.  So I had to sleep in, uh, this other room that, that faces the street and the homeless  people on the sidewalk.  So it's really loud.  That's great.  And it's a futon because, uh, uh, when I decided to live downstairs, I got this massive mattress  that actually Kenny helped me get downstairs in the basement.  Of course he did.  By jumping up and down on it to get it through the whole, you know, through the, uh, the, 
[00:07:30]  the passageway or the stair, the stairway.  I thought you put one of those yolks around his neck and had him pull it in.  So I can't get the mattress back upstairs.  It's impossible on the floor.  It was all wet.  No, no, no, no.  I didn't know.  I mean the bed frame and everything else was easy to get downstairs, but you know, these  mattresses now they have to be what?  Five feet thick for some reason.  They don't bend that easy.  So they don't bend that easy.  So, uh, club soda.  Kenny with his six, five frame was jumping up and down to get it, you know, through the 
[00:08:00]  stairway to get it downstairs.  Okay.  So that's not coming upstairs.  So I've been sleeping.  I should have scared him and he would have run through the doorway like Herman Munster  and broken it open wider.  So, um, big goon.  So I've been sleeping on futon in the, in the front room instead of a really nice bed.  Yeah.  Futons.  They're known for their comfort and it's been more than a one inch wide mattress.  Yeah.  It's been more hotel rooms than living in the apartment.  Okay. 
[00:08:30]  And I have been searching.  I have been searching for an apartment, uh, for many, many months, probably, uh, I think  I started about six months ago and I found, uh, an unbelievable place, an unbelievable place.  Right.  And after many, many, many months of searching, I finally found the place.  I really want to live.  It was perfect for me.  Perfect.  Loved it.  Well, yesterday I found out that I've been rejected by the board.  Uh, I am, I am found out. 
[00:09:00]  I thought this was going to end like in good news.  Good news.  No, no, I am so pissed off.  I am so pissed off and bummed out at the same time.  I can't even tell you.  You got rejected.  I got rejected by the board.  They didn't even meet with me.  Probably because of who you are.  That's why they, they're hinting at what I do for a living.  They must've Googled.  They get another, those, they're hinting at what I, what I do for a living.  Celebrities get rejected all the time because people don't want the media press. 
[00:09:30]  They don't want the people press outside.  I mean, it's-  Welcome to Nassau County, Opie.  I will welcome you with open arms to my county of Nassau County.  Dude, I can't even tell you how, how enraged I am, uh, this morning.  I can't even tell you.  Because when I went into this whole thing, right, you know, uh, I found this unbelievable  apartment and trust me, there are, you know, I got money to spend and there's still just  a bunch of crap out there.  You know, I walked through so many places and I'm like, you want how much for this? 
[00:10:00]  What?  Yeah.  And I was convinced I was never going to find something.  I looked at dozens and dozens of places and I finally found something.  I'm like, holy crap, this is it.  And it was a co-op.  And I'm like, look, co-ops, you know, I, I mean, I've heard just like everybody else  in New York that, you know, co-ops are, are kind of tough to get into.  And the, and the stupid real estate agent on the other side is like, no, this is a real  easy one.  All they care about is, uh, is your finances and stuff, make sure your papers are in order 
[00:10:30]  and your credit and all that.  Right.  All right.  It's worth going through.  So I stopped looking for a place.  This was, um, I don't, I, I would have to say three months ago.  I just stopped and I went through the process.  I signed a contract and then they're like, okay, all it's a left.  Uh, all is left is a board approval.  And then you got the board package together.  These people know more about me than I know about myself at that point.  They know how much money I'm making. 
[00:11:00]  They know stuff.  I, I, I swear to God, I have no clue about.  They have tax returns and canceled checks and bank statements.  They ask for all that crap.  Right.  And, and I went through this cause the lady's like, I'm telling you, this is an easy one.  You're in.  They just want to make sure you could pay the mortgage.  Okay.  Uh, they got my package, the, the real estate agent before she sent it over to the board.  And she's like, Oh my God, this is like, this is gonna be no problem.  Your credit is basically perfect, which it is.  And, uh, financially I'm in a really, really good, uh, you know, uh, place. 
[00:11:30]  So then she hands it over to them four weeks ago, four to five weeks ago before we went on vacation.  So they make you sit and wait for nothing.  So I sat in and waited for four or five weeks as I'm living in my, my crap hole and in hotel rooms and every day, like what is going on?  Right.  So, uh, finally early last week, uh, this real estate, uh, agent calls and goes, uh, the board needs a few more things.  I'm like, what?  What? 
[00:12:00]  Uh, you have to fill out a questionnaire.  You have to give them signed tax returns.  The tax returns I gave them, even though it's all my info wasn't good enough cause it wasn't a signed copy and they needed another $1,700.  Of course they did for what?  Well, uh, then where does it go?  Who got that?  The board to go over your application.  Uh, uh, I had to pay $300 for that board application fee, $300.  Uh, and I paid that when I signed the check, you know, to put down the down payment and the contracts, they decided out of nowhere that I had to pay another $1,700. 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, but I'm under counting of what that's for.  Or do they just make that number up and say, Hey, at this point I have to assume they just made that number up cause no one could give me a straight answer.  I'm like, I'm under contract.  I paid what, what the fee was, which was $300.  They've decided it was another $1,700 to make it up to $2,000.  Nonrefundable.  Oh yeah, of course. 
[00:13:00]  Everything's cashier checks and everything.  So you won't get that $1,700 back?  Hell no.  I'm going to try.  Dude, I swear to God, I'm, I want to strangle somebody.  Well, I want to strangle some.  I'm not even kidding, man.  I am so, I am so pissed and I'm so bummed at the same time.  I can't even tell you.  Perhaps the pest can help.  So this happened last Thursday.  Very resourceful.  This happened last Thursday.  And then I'm like, all right.  They're like, okay, you should, they should be calling you in for, um, you know, a meeting  any day now. 
[00:13:30]  So Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, uh, Wednesday, you know, I get an email, uh,  still haven't heard anything yet.  And then, uh, late yesterday afternoon, my sister calls me and I'm like assuming, okay,  Oh, here's the call.  You know, I'm going to meet with them.  Uh, maybe before I go to Cleveland today or maybe early next week, uh, they rejected you.  I'm like, what?  Rejected.  Rejected.  Last week when I gave the extra $1,700, they had to have known they were going to.  They knew already.  They were going to reject me.  What did they learn from the signatures on the tax?  What else could they learn? 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Right.  They knew already.  Let's get an extra $1,700.  That's what they did.  So.  Oh my God, you were robbed.  So everyone, you know, uh, involved in this and there's a, you know, there's lawyers all  over the place.  Bob's involved.  Super agent, Bob Eatman.  Of course he is.  Uh, their lawyers.  Everyone's like, what the F they rejected you without even meeting with you.  Cause everyone's looking at my package going, there's nothing in this package.  Yeah.  That says that, uh, you know, that says that I should be rejected. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And I don't even know the names of the people that rejected me.  Nothing.  That's it.  Anonymous.  Anonymous.  I just have to sit here and take it.  Oh, you could find out.  I'm sure.  Sure.  There are some resourceful people on our board on our board.  The Opie and Anthony board of pests that could get all the info you need.  I'm, I'm out of my mind.  I can't even tell you.  That says now would really bother me. 
[00:15:00]  Well, the 1700 is driving me nuts.  Cause you know, there's no way that they decided between Thursday and yesterday that  they were going to reject me.  They, they figured they were going to get a few extra bucks out of me.  I handed in my board package.  Uh, like I said, at least five weeks ago, I could give you the exact date, but it was  before we went on vacation.  Yeah.  And I believe we've been back about a month already.  And I just been sitting, sitting, sitting.  Can't look at other places.  Nothing.  Cause I was like, I, you know, I fell in love with it.  Unbelievable.  So now I'm screwed. 
[00:15:30]  I have to be out of the, you know, my, my crap hole in a week.  So you got one week now.  Yeah.  At least that was a place to, you know, uh, keep my stuff.  Cause I assumed I was just, I was leaving any, any, any, uh, day.  So it was fine.  Cause I'm like, all right, I'd see the end.  I see the end result here.  Oh, bastard.  Dude.  I can't even tell you elitists.  I can't even.  I am the biggest, biggest loser.  I know how to put together a really good radio show. 
[00:16:00]  When it comes to everything else, I'm, I'm the biggest loser in life.  I swear to God.  That's beyond your control, dude.  That's, that's something you did everything right.  You, you went through all the right steps.  That's not your fault.  I mean, they just rejected you because they knew who you were before that.  They just got some extra money out of you.  But that's, there's nothing.  You could have done anything differently unless you lied about what you did.  I mean, that was your fault.  But these people, these cowards, you know, you don't even know who rejected you.  And they got all your personal info.  They got tax returns going back three years.  They got, they got canceled checks.  They got, they could see every ATM machine I used in the last, I don't know, year. 
[00:16:30]  You get that back?  Huh?  You get that stuff back?  I sure as hell hope I get all that back.  And then these people, they're in some room somewhere.  Then you don't, you don't have to know them.  You don't get to know them.  You know, they don't even have the balls to like, have a meeting.  And everyone, like I said, is involved.  It's like, your package was perfect.  They should have met with you.  Not good enough for us.  Yeah.  Scumbags. 
[00:17:00]  They should be, you should have to meet within a week or give a decision within a week.  If you're not going to meet with somebody, they should let you know within a week.  They know.  They know immediately.  Of course they do.  All they got to do is do some, some quick checking.  And it's obviously not finances.  No.  Obviously not finances.  No, I'm telling you.  You afford the place.  And then, so it's personal reasons.  They don't like you as a person and what you do.  But they don't even know me.  They keep shopping the place.  They had you.  They said, well, this is who this guy is. 
[00:17:30]  He could be loud.  It could be a problem with the media.  Let's keep shopping the place.  And then they found somebody else for it.  It's like, okay, we can let him go now because we have somebody else.  Well, no.  Well, then I did a little more research and I'm the second person they rejected for this place.  And this place has been empty for, I don't know, almost a year.  You know how bad the seller must want to shoot the rest of the board?  Because that's the one thing to a condo that sucks.  I mean, a condo is great.  You can just kind of sell it.  But a co-op, you have to get approved to buy it.  And they have to approve whoever you sell it to.  Right.  So you can have like this great buyer who has cash and they could not. 
[00:18:00]  I just want to know who rejected me.  I want to see what they're all about.  You know?  Yeah, do a little checkup on them.  To reject me without even meeting me.  Get a name.  It just amazes me because my package was perfect.  Get a name.  You'll get every bit of information on the person.  And what's the $1,700 about when the application fee was $300?  Yeah.  Which I paid while I was under contract with this building.  And the person I was buying it from is beyond pissed off too.  Beyond pissed.  Of course. 
[00:18:30]  Who, by the way, is a famous person.  So this is going to make the papers now.  Great.  Oh.  This whole thing will be in the papers.  Oh.  Are you going back to terrestrial radio?  Is that what it is?  Oh, no.  That's somebody else.  Somebody that's on TV.  I can't even sell this.  Somebody that's on TV on a regular basis.  Hmm.  John Carr.  John Carr.  Oh. 
[00:19:00]  Unbelievable.  I mean, unbelievable.  This guy.  Where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  No.  They hate to have him go.  The laughs around the lobby are just too much.  There's the impersonations.  They're like, we can't let him move.  You think it's the real people?  Oh, there's the shuttle.  Let's go to Scott.  The space shuttle.  Scott.  Yes.  I just want to tell you, the people that rejected you, they probably paid like $30,000 for that  apartment 30 years ago.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  And they're judging you.  They probably made nothing of what you're making.  Yes.  Super Agent Bob Eatman said that.  The people that sit on these boards bought their place for like nothing back in the day.  Yeah.  Now they're judging you.  Yeah.  Judging me on what?  A little more diversity.  What are they judging me on?  No.  You hand in this package.  No.  You hand in this board package.  So what are they judging on me?  Judging me on.  The package was perfect.  Literally perfect.  Judging you on.  Which by the way, was so involved that it took, I don't know, almost a month to put 
[00:20:00]  together.  That's how much of a pain in the ass it was.  Opie and Dopey.  That's what they're judging you on.  Yep.  Absolutely.  Opie and Dopey.  You know, like a week and a half after you did it, like, no, look, we don't want any  celebrities.  We don't want the hassle of the media.  Because they're acting nasty.  I asked from day one.  You know, the agent knew who I was.  I'm like, co-op.  I'm like, I love the place.  I'm not going to lie to you, but it's a co-op.  I'm not stupid.  I've heard the horror stories.  I heard that Madonna has been rejected from buildings all over Manhattan. 
[00:20:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I don't want the press.  There's a book in Barnes and Noble that talks about co-ops and trying to get board approval  that I was thumbing through one day when I was just kind of in the bookstore.  And I was laughing my ass off.  Like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Like this stuff happens.  Like they rejected one guy because he applied for a JCPenney's card, even though he was a  multimillionaire.  My word.  A JCPenney's card.  He also rejected a guy because they were looking through his canceled checks and they discovered 
[00:21:00]  that he went to a liquor store, like a kind of cheapy liquor store, even though the guy  was a multimillionaire.  And they're like, ugh, we don't want a guy that is going to a cheap liquor store for his  alcohol.  Goes to liquor stores.  He went through your canceled checks.  Oh, yeah, and the bank statements.  Yeah.  There's a whole book on it in Barnes and Noble when I was in there last.  I was laughing like, oh, come on.  And now it's happened to me.  And I said to later, look, it's you know, I don't want to go through this whole process  if I'm going to get rejected because of who I am.  Oh, this board is really easy.  They just want to make sure you can pay your mortgage. 
[00:21:30]  So I I freaking put everything on hold going.  All right.  I guess I'm going to, you know, go forward and get this place now.  Now I am so apt.  I can't even tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.  You know, condos.  I guess I'm already getting, you know, listings for other places.  I don't even want to.  I don't even want to look again now.  I hate New York.  Yeah.  I hate New York.  This solidifies it.  I can't stand this place.  So what's your backup plan here? 
[00:22:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because I swear to God, I'm a loser when when it outside this studio.  I'm a loser.  I can't figure out crap.  You didn't do it wrong.  You did everything right.  They rejected because of who you are.  It's not like you're packaged or you screwed up and you haven't been keeping your finances.  You did all the stuff you're supposed to do.  They just they're just scumbags.  They're notorious scumbags.  They've rejected Woody Allen.  They've rejected a lot of.  You're in good company.  Kind of a testament to the fact that you're really famous.  But they told me like, look, that's not that hasn't been a problem. 
[00:22:30]  So now they are rejecting me for who I am because my board package is perfect.  And I don't know who these people are.  And if you know anything about me, the people that are friends and family of myself, they know what I'm about.  This is this is the type of thing that drives me to the point of doing something stupid because I can't tell you that there's some like nameless, faceless person somewhere that knows more about me than I know about myself. 
[00:23:00]  And I'm not even kidding, like just said, no, no, without even meeting me that I can't tell you just drives me nuts.  Nuts.  Yeah.  Suburbs or condo because condo, there's no approval.  Yeah.  I did.  You have to go to through approval.  No, no.  They just the board just make sure the condo is so much easier.  They just make sure you can pay it and you can sell to whoever you want.  You can sell to whoever you want. 
[00:23:30]  That's what you did, Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And this board, you know, this co-op thing, you know, is amazing to begin with because if you started like, you know, profiling like in neighborhoods.  Oh, yeah.  You can't.  No, you're not allowed.  When you're looking for houses in the suburbs, you can't ask about, you know, what type of races are in the area.  Well, no, you can't ask.  You can't ask.  They will.  They're not allowed to tell you.  Are you kidding?  They're not allowed to tell you.  Wow.  They can't. 
[00:24:00]  You know what they tell you about?  They tell you about the school system and the taxes and the schools.  Yeah.  And that usually lets you know what element is in the neighborhood.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  When it comes to co-ops, all's fair, man.  Not that you'd want to do that, but you could always find out people who live there who are on the board.  That's not hard to do.  I'm sure if you have an address and eventually you're not there.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody would absolutely know how to find out.  And the O&A board could take over. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  See if they get approved.  You should get your $1,700 back.  That's just robbery.  Yeah.  They robbed you.  What administrative fees cost them $1,700?  $1,700 more after I'm under contract.  Well, we have to look at this stuff.  We need another $1,000.  $600 won't do it.  We think it's going to be $1,000.  And the other $700 is to have him look at it, too.  They're just rapists.  My word. 
[00:25:00]  So there you go.  There's the update.  I am screwed.  I thought you were going to make it.  I thought you were in.  Everyone said I was.  I looked at, you know, and I looked at so many places.  Just the thought of, you know, going back out there and trying to find something.  I don't even, you know.  I hate this city.  This solidifies it.  I hate this effing city.  Holy crap.  And then it's like, well, go back to the suburbs, which I would love to do. 
[00:25:30]  But then the commute kills you.  Then the commute kills you.  Yeah.  You just can't move, like, really far out into the city.  You can't go back to Huntington, you know.  You can't go middle of the island.  Right.  You got to kind of live real close to the Nassau Queens border kind of a thing.  And then you get in early.  You like going home after, like, you like to just kind of just hang out and walk home and  be home in 20 minutes.  So if you're walking.  That's the one thing about living in the city that's cool.  You just walk. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  Roller blade.  Get out of this crap hole at the end of the day.  Just, I want to leave unless I'm staying in a nice hotel where they have to clean up after  me.  Wipe me.  Wipe me.  Faced out of the pillow.  That's what I say.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  Wipe me.  This city stinks.  Know what this city is all about?  You come here if you're lucky enough.  You're at the top of your game, whether it's in radio or whatever the profession is. 
[00:26:30]  You make as much money as you can from this city.  And then you take a big, huge crap on it and leave and enjoy your life somewhere.  You retire to some nice, quiet place.  And then watch all the other...  Like Pismo Beach.  And watch all the other savages trying to rip everyone else off and make their...  Scratch and claw their way to the top.  This place stinks.  You make as much money as you can.  You take a giant crap and you go find a really nice, normal place to live in the suburbs 
[00:27:00]  or another city.  I've heard you make it here.  You make it anywhere.  That's all crap.  It's up to you.  Well...  New York.  I won't be the party pooper.  We got a lot to talk about today.  Too late, party pooper.  Now I'm all depressed.  Yeah, that story annoyed me.  I really...  MacBook entries today.  Fatty pig fatty.  Fatty pig fatty contest.  We'll explain next.  So excited about that.  Heading to Cleveland right after the show.  We're broadcasting live from Cleveland tomorrow morning.  Even though they're going to rerun the show in the afternoon. 
[00:27:30]  So hopefully some fans will show up at the station in Cleveland tomorrow morning.  Blowfly hates us.  Screw Blowfly.  He's clown shoes.  And we'll also talk about mancation.  Ooh.  We got lots to do today.  Ooh, I didn't mean to make that noise, but...  It's the ONA virus.  Yeah.  Spreading across America.  You got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  No! 
[00:28:00]  You didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  I'm scared.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:28:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Heading to the airport right after the show today.  We'll be in Cleveland tomorrow morning.  The Aerodrome.  What?  We're heading to the Aerodrome.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Broadcast live from Cleveland tomorrow morning.  We're doing our show.  It'll rebroadcast in Cleveland later in the afternoon.  Yeah.  They play the show in afternoons up there.  So come on by the radio station in the morning.  We'll have some fun stuff for you, okay?  Let's go to Trevor really fast, then we'll move on to other things.  Trevor in Philly, what's up? 
[00:29:00]  Trevor.  Hey there.  Hey there.  You're missing a piece of the puzzle.  What's up?  It doesn't have to do with you, the seller.  It has to do with the buyer.  They're trying to put the screws to the buyer.  No, no, no.  Opie's the buyer.  Opie is the buyer.  Wrong way, wrong way.  You mean the seller.  They're trying to screw the seller.  Why?  The seller did something, violated some of the covenants, something in the unit.  The seller shouldn't put...  Oh, man.  Your phone stinks, dude.  Can you find a place where you're getting...  Because you're actually probably making a valid point. 
[00:29:30]  The seller probably did a lot of things that really pissed off the building.  Upset the building.  And the board.  And the board.  The all-powerful, nameless, faceless board.  And the board is going to reject every buyer that comes along.  Trevor, please call back.  Call back, sweetie.  We can't understand anything you're saying, unfortunately.  And I would love to know your opinion on this whole thing.  Because right now, and I hate to use real estate terms, you know, dude, it's a buyer's  market, dude.  But that's what it is. 
[00:30:00]  Dude.  This is where you need Bob.  No, dude, here's what they do.  You tell me.  Right.  Stupid.  What do they do?  They...  Now this guy will have to drop the price again for the next guy, because it does suck.  This is a bad time to be selling something.  So you're actually buying at a good time.  Oh, great.  I mean, financially.  So they may be doing it just to make them drop the price again.  It's so hard to watch when you watch one of these L.A. perp...  Oh, that was a good one. 
[00:30:30]  Ah, they chased his car.  They knocked him out in L.A. when they do real fun car chases.  And they knocked this guy, his car, so he spun.  He gets out and, of course, starts running.  A cop car pulls up right next to him, opens the passenger door, hits him, and knocks him  into the weeds.  It's hysterical if you get a chance to see it.  There you go.  Hey, the Fat Contest.  It's on, right?  We have officially started.  Yeah.  And we got a...  We got a promo.  Ooh!  We got a promo from Steve. 
[00:31:00]  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Yeah, we came up with the name after we left you guys yesterday and continued on XM.  Here is the official promo for our Fat Contest.  Do-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!  Do-oo-oo-oo-oo!  Do-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo!  It's the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Cuttast!  He blanked!  The Opie and Anthony Show is looking for fat, blubbery, undisciplined women to point and  laugh at.  Don't worry, we're willing to pay for the privilege.  Just haul your big, embarrassing ass down to our free FM studio in New York City,  strap a pig mask around your fat skull,  squeeze your hindquarters into a bikini, and have a snack for $15. 
[00:31:30]  The biggest mess to waddle through the door at the end of the contest  wins $10 for every humiliating pound on her carcass.  So if you're saddled with 350 pounds of embarrassing flab, you'll get $3,500.  Dry those tears, young lady.  Three grand buys a lot of Kleenex and a lot of pizza.  Brought to you by your compassionate friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  $10 a pound, you disasters.  Come on.  We don't fake it here. 
[00:32:00]  We love to point, stare, and laugh.  It makes us feel better about ourselves.  That's right.  To look at others that are really, really in bad shape.  And the name for the contest is just brilliant.  Jimmy came up with it yesterday.  Fatty pig fatty.  We were toiling.  Joking around on the air over the next time about awful names.  Awful names for this contest.  We toiled over it.  And Jimmy came out with one of the most simplest yet hysterical names for this stupid contest.  I love it. 
[00:32:30]  We didn't want any room for misinterpretation.  Right.  We felt as a group that fatty pig fatty summed it up nicely.  The use of the word fatty twice is sheer brilliance.  Yeah.  And then putting the pig in the middle really brings them both together.  So we have this girl, Sarah.  She said she was going to stop by today.  What was she?  250?  230?  230, I think.  Yeah, but it would be a great place to start the contest.  Great start.  If she makes it all the way to the end, that would be $2,300.  I think it's going to go up, though.  Right now, it's $10 a pound. 
[00:33:00]  I think we're setting up one of those PayPal accounts.  Oh, cool.  Because listeners want to get involved with this.  We'll raise a few more bucks, and we'll raise the total per pound.  Why not?  And I think we're going to get some other prizes as well.  You know, $10 a pound ain't that bad.  What's Sonny Ferrelli saying?  $10 a pound, that's really not that much money.  To do nothing.  You're doing nothing, first of all, except being what you are, fat.  All you have to do is come in and stand on a scale.  I mean, we love to see you in your brown panties and stuff like that, 
[00:33:30]  and some girls will do that.  But basically, you come in, and we weigh you.  $100 a pound.  Sonny, you're an idiot.  $100 a pound?  Who's paying $35,000 for a 350-pound woman, Sonny?  To just walk through the door.  There's an elevator here.  I can understand if she ought to maybe take the stairs.  But God damn it, she's just got to show up and be fat.  Yeah, so the contest is on.  What the hell is wrong with you?  So for all the fatties out there, all you have to do is show up.  We would love to see one today before we head off to Cleveland. 
[00:34:00]  Just one animal, show up, please.  One lousy animal.  And we're going to be in Cleveland, so the contest is on tomorrow  when we're broadcasting sort of live.  We'll be live, but then they'll hear it in the afternoons in Cleveland.  And whoever puts the most weight on, actually,  we're going to do some kind of a side contest starting today, I think,  from today until Halloween it ends.  So the most weight you put on, there's also a prize for that.  You win money for that.  So if you put on 30 pounds in the month,  or if you come in the day before Halloween, you weigh, like, say, 190, 
[00:34:30]  and you come back the next day, you weigh 220, you'll probably win.  That's it.  Come in whenever you want.  That's a hell of a tumor.  Oh, yeah.  That's a hell of a tumor.  To eat someone's child.  So is Sarah coming?  Did we call her?  You called her, and she got scared probably because you didn't talk to her.  Here comes Travis.  Oh, boy, he's rarely on the show.  Travis, yes.  I left your message.  All right, thanks.  Get back there.  Jesus.  He's a skinny girl, skinny contest winner.  You got to say it into the microphone because no one heard you.  Nothing?  No, it's okay.  It's okay. 
[00:35:00]  It's all right.  We got Trevor back.  Trevor in Philly, what's up?  Like I said before,  the problem is they're trying to go after the guy that's selling the unit.  The person who sold is trying to sell the unit  must have done something to that board,  violated the covenants,  did some remodeling without the proper licenses,  did something that pissed the board off,  and the board said,  don't worry,  we're going to get you eventually.  When it really counts,  we're going to get you.  And you can be as squeaky clean. 
[00:35:30]  You can put 100% down.  You're going to pay the whole thing in cash.  By the way,  they did a background check on you with that $1,700.  They did a full background check,  not just your financials.  They interviewed folks.  They don't want a high-profile person  that's going to create.  Well, the person I'm buying from,  it hurts me to say this,  but he's more high-profile.  Well, you've got to...  But not controversial.  I don't know.  He's more high-profile.  His name is very well-known.  He's been around a lot longer than I have.  And not controversial. 
[00:36:00]  Not at all.  Because now people are trying to figure out  what celebrity I'm buying,  well,  was going to buy the place from.  The only controversy is  what gender does he sleep with?  Ah, is that a controversy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is it?  Do you know?  No.  His wife was on the contract.  Oh, he's married.  Yeah, so...  I guess that ends up.  So that helps.  There you go.  A married guy  that's on TV a lot.  I want you to think  that it's only about you.  It might have something  to do with him as well.  All right.  Thank you, Trevor.  Good point, Trevor.  I can imagine that guy 
[00:36:30]  having a problem.  There was a point  when I was going through  the whole thing.  I thought it was too good  to be true.  Hey, speaking of Fatty Pig Fatty,  we had a lot of large women  call the show yesterday.  Big girls.  Remember the girl?  That was 463 pounds.  463.  She was a big one.  Big trucker from what?  Illinois?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we had her on  for about 20 minutes  and we just destroyed her.  And she's a faithful listener  to the show.  Well, she called up a little...  She's a truck driver.  She was a little confrontational.  Not bad.  She was a little hurt by it.  She kind of called up  like, I don't like this. 
[00:37:00]  Like, she didn't just  call up to be friendly.  She was trying to give us  the business.  Yeah.  Forgive my harsh language.  And we made her feel better,  I think.  We helped her out.  So she was 463 pounds.  We talked to her for 20 minutes.  Than and the guys,  they took the phone call  and threw a nice little  quick two-minute montage  together of some of the lines.  These are the lines  we could play over here  because it got really,  really dirty.  Can Steve stop saying  in the...  I love the promo Steve did,  but he says,  and a lot of pizza.  The way he says pizza, 
[00:37:30]  I want to take a nice hot one  and mush it in his face  and burn him.  Pizza.  Here's the girl from yesterday.  Not to be disrespectful,  but how disgustingly fat  a pig are you?  463.  You had to be giving  out your phone number.  I feel sorry  for the left side  of your car.  What's your MySpace address?  I enjoy buying shoes  and having barnacles  scraped off me.  No.  I'm pretty active  for a big girl.  What do you do  that's active?  Try to get out  of a tar pit.  You lost a lot of weight  from what I see here  because it says 
[00:38:00]  graduated 2,000.  So you dropped...  How much is that?  I can't do math  real quick.  30 pounds.  You don't like celery.  It's just the sound  your floorboards make  when you walk on them.  I see you got a song  playing on your webpage  from the band Everlast.  Yes, I love Everlast.  Everlast is what food  never does in her house.  It's never last.  She likes Everlast  because it reminds her of herself  because she's a heavy bag.  My ex-boyfriend,  who is Jeff,  my company wrote him up 
[00:38:30]  for something  that he did not do  and he was...  What, bestiality?  I like bigger than me.  Food!  All right!  Food!  All right!  Food!  All right!  If you look up  Lincoln's Challenge in Rantoul,  I graduated from there.  That's a military school.  And I did that  when I was 233.  What were you,  the tank?  When you were  in military school  to do exercises,  would they make you  lay in a puddle  and pretend you were  Iwo Jima?  When Marilyn  committed a crime,  the detective referred  to her M.O.  and by that  he meant morbid obesity.  You know what I say?  I've been big 
[00:39:00]  since I was 12  and if you guys  come up with something new,  let me know.  She's heard it all.  All right.  All right.  How about a diet?  Yeah, how about this?  A one look in the mirror  that isn't filled  with shame and self-hatred.  How about a calorie counter?  The issue is  all the self-hatred  and loneliness.  I don't hate myself.  You should.  What has led you  during this conversation  to believe  that I hate myself?  Four, a six,  and a three  back to back.  Well, maybe...  And a belly to belly.  You can't even rearrange 
[00:39:30]  those three numbers  to make it look good.  No.  There's no order  to make you go with that.  There's none  unless we throw  in a decimal point.  She looks like  a giant filet mignon.  There you go.  Just a taste.  That went off  for 20 minutes yesterday.  It was just nonstop.  So ladies,  you'll be treated  respectfully when you come in.  Really, you will.  And you'll walk away  with some fine prizes.  $10 a pound,  that's guaranteed  and then we're working  on some other things, okay?  So hopefully someone  will show up today. 
[00:40:00]  Sarah, if you're not showing up,  give us a call  and at least let us know  because we're all excited  to get this contest going.  All right?  If you're in the area  and you're a large gal,  come on by, say hi,  get weighed,  and you can leave.  And we bought masks.  Okay.  So you can even come in studio  with a mask on your head  so no one knows who you are.  Just change your name  and the town you're from.  We don't care.  You know what we should do?  We got a Tinkerbell mask  and if you want to wear a mask,  it has to be a Tinkerbell mask  and you have to hold  like the little dainty wand,  like a little Tinkerbell wand,  like you're casting a spell. 
[00:40:30]  Tee hee.  I hope someone shows today.  Oh, me too.  I've never wanted to see  a fat chick  and I never will again  this month, ladies.  It's your lucky month.  All right, don't forget,  Bud Light presents  the Opie and Anthony  Traveling Virus,  the comedy event of 2006.  The last date is here.  It's two days away.  It's this Saturday  at the Tower City Amphitheater  in Cleveland, Ohio.  I'm hearing a lot of people  are road tripping  from all over the place.  I know Pittsburgh's  sending a bunch of listeners  that won a contest  so that's going to be  really, really cool.  Tickets, I don't know.  Are they $10 again?  I think so.  I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  I mean, Pete,  I had not talked to Pete today.  All right.  Talk to him at like nine.  Can I go?  Oh, sorry.  Tickets on sale now  through all Ticketmaster locations  presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Yes, Sam?  I just want to try something here.  I'm not sure of something.  Okay.  Somebody could be in trouble.  Okay.  So I want to warn Al  down the hall to  and buy on the dump button  just in case.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Because you're going to  move on to something else.  Sarah.  Hi.  You're coming down?  Yes, I am.  Yeah!  All right.  Fatty Pink Fatty is on! 
[00:41:30]  What time?  I should be ready  to leave here  in about 30 minutes.  I live in Queens,  so it could take me  about an hour to get there.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  We're only on till 8.50.  Yeah.  Come on, hurry.  I'll try to rush it.  Yeah, come.  No, hurry.  You got to get here  before like 8.45, all right?  Okay.  And rush hour traffic  from Queens.  We know the deal.  Get in your car.  Oh, I don't drive.  Oh, you're taking  a subway?  I'm coming by subway, yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Okay, that might be  a good day.  All right, cool.  The police officer  rides her in.  Bye.  If you're not going to make it,  please call back  and tell us, all right?  Because we're very excited  to get the contest.  Yes.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Sarah.  No problem.  And we'll be nice to Sarah.  That's great.  She knows that.  Go ahead, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Be ready on any dump.  Let me try this.  Why don't you go  into a crowded piece of crap?  Okay.  I just got the wrong templates  for this machine.  See, I have two machines.  Yeah.  We got one for here.  Yeah.  And one for...  Down the way.  Down the way. 
[00:42:30]  Over there at XM.  And I seem to have the XM one  because I tried to play a clip  from The Bad Lieutenant.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because that's what I had  sitting in front of me here.  All right.  And that is probably why  the Waldorf clip didn't come up.  Mm.  Because this...  Okay.  Different.  All right.  We'll figure that out  during the break.  It's the ONA virus  spreading across America.  Opian Anthony.  The Opian Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Good morning.  You're listening to  The Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus 
[00:43:00]  spreading across America.  Fatty.  Pig Fatty is on.  We got Sarah coming from Queens.  He's about 230 pounds.  Other fat girls  could show up today  because it's not a guarantee  that Sarah's even  going to show up.  So if you're...  If you weigh a little less  than 230,  just show up.  $10 a pound.  And we could re-weigh you  at the end of the contest.  So if you're like,  I don't know,  210, 220,  you come on by  and then, you know,  you pack on a  20 or 30 pounds 
[00:43:30]  before Halloween.  Might have a shot  at this thing.  $10 a pound  to the winner.  A lot of money  for just being  what you are.  Fast.  Being a fat gal.  That's what we're asking.  You come up here,  you show a little skin.  You'd be in a bikini.  And E-Rock  just got a communique  from Imus' camp.  They're loving  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Oh.  They're loving the idea.  And once the contestants  start rolling in,  hey, 
[00:44:00]  quite literally,  I think it'll really  make everybody happy.  I know I'll be happy.  And we're going to do this  for about a month  because I think  eventually  we're going to have  people travel to New York  to try to win this contest.  I'm going to predict  that we get someone  that's over 400 pounds  in the end.  You think it's going to be  like over 400 pounders  going to win this?  Oh, yeah.  That's like over $4,000.  Yeah, well,  Free FM here in New York,  they're like,  don't you want to do the contest  for a week or two?  I'm like, no, a month.  This thing's going to  slowly build  and then people are going 
[00:44:30]  to start looking around  in their neighborhoods  and going,  oh, my God,  I can make some money  off this fat broad  because we're looking  for the guys  to convince some  of these girls  to come on in  and say hi to us  and we'll be nice.  We got the masks  and the bags  to put over your head  if you're embarrassed.  If you're shy,  just put on a Tinkerbell mask  and hold a wand  and daintily skip  around the studio  going,  tee-hee,  I'm casting a spell.  Tee-hee.  And then get out.  Yeah, we're looking  for some girls  that have a sense of humor  so we can put them 
[00:45:00]  in tutus  or roll them around  and flower.  Dress them up  like we damn well please  is what we do.  They're our own  little fat Barbie dolls  to play with.  They're going to come in  and if we want to put them  in a tutu  or a little bikini  or whatever the hell  we want to,  a piggy mask,  they got to do that.  It's part of the cash,  the chance of winning  that much cash.  And of course,  Ivis is loving this.  This is the type of radio  he wants to do.  He doesn't want to talk  to all his dumb politicians.  You don't think so?  No.  But he knows he's older now. 
[00:45:30]  He can't get away  with this type of radio.  Yeah.  That's why of course  he loves this.  Iraq goes,  I'm his camp  is loving this.  I know,  I know they're loving this.  They just had to change  their show.  Fat piggy fat.  Fatty.  Fatty pig fatty.  Fatty pig fatty.  Here's the latest  on Anna Nicole Smith.  This story's getting  just beyond bizarre.  Crazy.  I find a thing  that's just to me  any kind of fatty.  Maybe not,  but Anna Nicole Smith  is now a whole lot richer  only after her son's death. 
[00:46:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  She's too happy.  What show is this from?  It's from,  she's too happy  for a dead  20-year-old  guy story.  A dead,  what amounts to,  you know,  a kid's story.  Yeah.  Well,  they have no emotion.  They don't know  how to emote anything.  God,  do I hate news people.  Sorry.  Continue.  Just had to reiterate that.  Well,  Smith is now a whole lot richer  only days after her son's death.  She and the Getty Photo Agency 
[00:46:30]  have sold  the last living shots  of her dead son,  Daniel,  for $600,000.  Now,  a Smith rep states  she will catalog  and sell off  her son's personal belongings  along with his cremated remains.  Her attorney stated,  we pledge to provide  certificates of authenticity  for every last scrap  of Daniel Wayne Smith memorabilia  from the 4x4 coaster-sized pieces  of his bath mat  to the wadded tissues  in the trash can.  As if this is not creepy enough,  Smith has not yet decided 
[00:47:00]  whether to sell her boy's ashes  at a fixed price  or through an auction.  This is a joke, right?  It has to be.  Is this mad TV?  It's a joke.  It's got to be a joke.  What?  This is mad TV, right?  How could it be a joke?  It's on,  it's,  it's,  it's a joke.  It could be,  is this a joke?  Did you get this really  from a news show?  Yeah, it was Fox 5.  It could be glaringly inaccurate.  It has to be.  She's selling her son's remains?  Okay, hey,  I wouldn't see it as a joke.  I see,  I could see it being  some really shoddy reporting  based on rumor, 
[00:47:30]  speculation.  Because you know  she's a bad reporter  or bad writer  when they said  the last living photos  taken of her dead son.  It's like,  you didn't need to have it  worded that way.  Last living photos  kind of draws the inference  that they're now dead.  Yeah,  that you're dead.  Yeah,  those pictures were from  the day before,  I guess.  Yeah,  well,  how would they have  gotten those?  That's a little odd.  Yeah,  but she's selling  the remains?  Is she really doing this?  I mean,  is there other 
[00:48:00]  news organizations  backing this up?  Is there a statement  on her personal website?  Are there things  to confirm this?  Because if,  if she is doing this,  she's one of the  sickest bitches ever.  Just what a resilient woman.  Bounce back from the death  of your child like that.  Well now,  I see this headline,  she's selling the photos  to pay for his funeral. 
[00:48:30]  First of all,  a funeral is not  that expensive.  He has her ex-husband's money.  Yeah.  A funeral is not  that expensive.  She's got the money  from the diet company  she was on.  She's got the money  from that show  she was doing.  How about the billionaire  she was sleeping with?  Yeah,  the billionaire's money.  She's still fighting  for that money?  She's still litigating,  but believe me,  she's not broke enough  where she can't afford  a son's funeral,  and she doesn't need  600 large  to plant a kid.  Jesus Christ.  And then to auction off  all of his personal effects? 
[00:49:00]  Who wants his stupid  bath mat as a coaster?  His dirty teenage feet?  You know who does?  Who?  What's his name?  Oh, Andrew Gore?  Yeah, Andrew Gore.  Yeah, but that's...  Andrew Gore's probably  bidding on this stuff  right now.  Probably killed him.  We're gonna bring back  another bit.  Probably killed him.  Probably killed him.  That creep.  We're bringing back  another bit.  What?  The strangest thing  you own.  We'll do that soon.  I wrote it down.  It's in the book.  It's official.  I like that.  Let's go to Angel  in Massachusetts. 
[00:49:30]  Angel!  Yeah?  Angel.  Hello?  Yes.  Are you a girl?  Huh?  Are you a girl?  Yeah, you can't hear  the woman voice?  I'm a female.  Yeah.

No, I, uh,  it's a childhood thing. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  From childhood.  I thought it was  too much extra crispy  going down the vocal cords,  scraping.  What do you mean  it's a childhood thing?  You were born with a penis?  Yeah, you have a really  deep man's voice.  Yes, I know.  Get mistaken on the phone  all the time?  Yes, I do.  I get a lot of  hang-up calls for it.  Could you put the lady  and human of the house  on the phone, please?  How are we going to get the,  uh, how are we going to  get you here?  What are we going to do? 
[00:50:30]  Huh?  How are we going to  get you here, sweetie?  Um, we're going there  by car to New York.  Oh, you are?  I thought it would take a while  to get a forklift  to, uh, drive down the parkway.  Are you, are you, uh,  is your husband bringing you  or what?  Um, no, a friend.  A friend?  Yeah.  Is this the most you've,  you weighed?  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  When were you at your thinnest  and what was your thinnest?  Well, I started weighing,  uh, 300 at about age 18. 
[00:51:00]  18?  Uh-huh.  Oh, God.  But were you,  were you like a pudgy  little kid and everything?  Yes, I was.  I was born to be fat.  Get your motor on.  Born to be fat.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan,  dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  Wow.  Can we get that song?  Born to be.  Where's Weird Al Yankovic  when you need it?  And a lot of pizza.  Pizza.  Pizza.  We got to hear Steve 
[00:51:30]  say pizza again.  It's enough to make you  want to just smack his mouth.  All right, hold on.  You want to cup smack his mouth.  All right, hold on.  You want to cup your hand.  Pizza.  And a lot of pizza.  Listen to the way  he says pizza.  You'll never want to hear it.  Coffee and pizza.  August.  Someone on the cell phone  doing their instant feedbacking.  Yeah.  Uh, very confused.  Fatty Pig Tranny?  Uh, no.  Oh.  It's Fatty Pig Fatty.  She just has a deep breath.  All right.  Well, here's the official promo  for Fatty Pig Fatty.  Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it. 
[00:52:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony  Fatty Pig Fatty Goddance.  The Opie and Anthony show  is looking for fat, blubbery,  undisciplined women  to point and laugh at.  Don't worry, we're willing  to pay for the privilege.  Just haul your big,  embarrassing ass  down to our free FM studio  in New York City,  strap a pig mask  around your fat skull,  squeeze your hindquarters  into a bikini,  and have a snack for 15.  The biggest mess  to waddle through the door  at the end of the contest  wins 10 bucks  for every humiliating pound  on her carcass.  So if you're saddled 
[00:52:30]  with 350 pounds  of embarrassing flab,  you'll get $3,500.  Try those tears, young lady.  $3,000 buys a lot  of Kleenex  and a lot of pizza  brought to you  by your compassionate  friends at the  Opie and Anthony show.  A lot of pizza.  Bies a lot of pizza.  A lot of pizza.  A lot of pizza.  Pizza.  I think every contestant  has to pose  with the pig mask on.  Okay.  Yeah, that's only fair.  It's mandatory.  That's the picture  we'll throw up 
[00:53:00]  on the website.  So Angel,  when can we expect you?  Um, expect me Monday.  Monday morning.  Yes.  All right, you got to get here  between 6 and 9.  6 and 9?  Yeah.  Okay, I'll be there.  Now, listen to me.  If you're the fattest  by the end of the contest,  which is around Halloween,  we're going to end this thing,  you're going to win  $3,550.  Wow.  Could you use that?  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah?  All right.  Pizza. 
[00:53:30]  You're going to give me  plenty of pizza?  Right now,  it's $10 a pound,  but I think we're going  to get the pest involved.  We're going to do  a little PayPal thing  and see if we can raise  that money a little higher  for the people, okay?  Oh, I'm sure one of the  message boards  is going to complain.  They're talking about  the pest again.  I don't like when  they talk about the pest.  Now, I have a question.  Shut up.  Not you, sweetheart.  Yeah, go ahead.  About the, um,  you have to wear a bikini?  No, I mean...  What?  No, we just want you  to come through that door  and, uh, get weighed. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, okay.  I mean, we're hoping  some of the ladies  wear a bikini.  Okay.  If we force them  to wear a bikini,  we're not going to get  as many contestants.  Yeah, no, we're not  going to force you.  We will get enough  that will be good eggs  to do it for us.  How about...  You got to wear  the pig mask, though.  How about...  You have to wear  the pig mask?  No, if you want to.  If you want to.  Oh, of course I would like to.  I don't care.  All right, then you have to.  I think the bikini  should give you  a plus five  on the pounds. 
[00:54:30]  No, because we want...  Five pounds added  to your weight  if you put the bikini on.  We want accurate pounds.  How about a cash prize?  I want them  in the goddamn bikini.  That's the most...  What I'm saying...  How about a cash prize  for every girl  that, you know,  puts a bikini on?  You get a little extra cash  for the bikini?  Yeah.  All right, whatever works.  Now we have to supply that, right?  Huh?  Yeah, or just bring  your sexiest bra and panties.  Yeah, just something  that's not a one-piece.  Okay.  Bra, panties.  When are you coming? 
[00:55:00]  Monday.  Okay, good.  Monday, definitely.  All right.  I'm looking forward to it.  All right, Angel, hold on.  We're going to get some info  because we want to confirm  that you're showing on Monday  because there's a lot  of other girls out there  that are thinking  about coming down.  They hear you're coming down  and you're weighing 355.  Now they don't want to come down.  But she might not come down.  Yeah, trust me.  We do these contests  all the time  and for the most part,  no one ever shows up.  We got this girl, Sarah,  and I hope Sarah  doesn't bail now  because Sarah,  if you're listening,  we don't know  if she's going to show up  this Angel. 
[00:55:30]  Maybe we should have  first, second, and third  and have a lower cash amount  per pound for a second  and lower for third  so at least they get something.  Like, you know,  win place or show  for a horse race.  It's definitely $10 a pound  for the winner.  Yeah.  All right, we got to get  the PayPal up  because we're going to need  some help from the listeners.  I'm throwing in easily a grand.  I think I'm throwing in a grand,  but, you know, come on.  I'll put in $35.  All right, Angel,  we'll see you Monday.  Hold on the line.  Okay.  Angel, now we're talking. 
[00:56:00]  Fatty pig fatty.  Yep.  Is on.  It's off and running.  That's right.  And they're off.  And they're off is right.  Okay.  There was something else  we want to do here.  The heck was I thinking  about the boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Oh, it had something to do with that.  Ah, whatever.  What's going on in the news?  Do we have any news stuff to do today?  Oh, thanks a lot, Travis.  What is this?  There's plenty.  Plenty of sounds and.  Well, the man. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  I don't believe it, though.  It's not from.  What is it from?  Is this from her website?  No.  We're looking at the Anna Nicole Smith  selling dead son's personal effects  and ashes article.  This story comes out of the Bahamas.  This is not.  There's no way.  I mean, you know,  I could see her selling the pictures of her son.  I could see that.  No way she's selling the remains of her son, though.  No, it's just silly.  We'll have to wait and see how true that really is. 
[00:57:00]  Bravo, Sierra.  Bravo, Sierra.  Okay.  Um, is this an English site or something?  It's from NASA.  It's, oh, are expected to dwarf the 344,000 pounds.  I see pounds instead of dollars.  Pains.  It could be phony.  Boy, if she is doing this, wow.  That is just heartless, ruthless.  But, I'll hold judgment for two seconds. 
[00:57:30]  One, two.  What a, what a sick bitch.  All right.  Must be nice, though.  I was saying that earlier.  Go through life like a sociopath.  Just not care.  Imagine if she's doing this and really just doesn't care.  Like, yeah, sell the stuff off.  I don't care.  Don't care about anything.  Like, whether it was her upbringing or whatever the hell she had to go through to get to the point she was, is at.  Just, like, completely devoid of emotion. 
[00:58:00]  There's something to be said for that.  You like that?  I don't know if I like it.  There's something to be said for it.  And I'm saying it.  All right.  You want to do some MacBook entries?  Yes.  Let's see how this.  We've got a big contest going on.  We're just contest central.  We're trying.  Aren't we?  Here's the deal.  We're asking you to send us your 30-second or less production piece about the Opie and Anthony show.  And the week of October 2nd, we're going to announce the best five entries.  You can submit your entry at 923freefm.com by September 29th. 
[00:58:30]  What's that?  Like, a little over a week?  A week from Monday, I guess?  Yeah.  Or a week from Sunday?  Okay.  You can win the new MacBook.  The top five entries will win a MacBook.  All right?  It has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities, and you can take it with you wherever you go.  Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out.  And the entries are coming in, and they're interesting, to say the least.  Oh, is that it?  Interesting? 
[00:59:00]  That means crap.  Well, we'll listen to a couple of these and see if there's any gems.  The first one is from Chris M.  We've had over 100 entries so far.  These are sort of worth playing.  As a listener of the Opie and Anthony show, you'll experience professionalism and integrity,  mixing with fun and entertaining conversations about the life and the world we live in.  Oh, balloon animals!  Jimmy, can you write me a text message?  I don't know how to text. 
[00:59:30]  Mer-  All right, enough of that talk.  Opie and Anthony, striving for excellence.  All right.  There's something kind of funny about that.  Yeah?  I like the whole idea of radio excellence, and it's just us doing what we do on a daily  basis.  Nonsense.  It's kind of funny, but it ends a little, you know, abruptly.  It's all right. 
[01:00:00]  It's called Jimmy.  That was Chris M.  It's funny.  All right, the next one is from Kevin T.  It's not completely awful, is what I'm saying.  It's all right.  Yeah.  I give it a C+.  Yeah.  Here's Kevin T., the real Anthony.  I'm a hateful, hateful person.  I just want to kill black people.  You're filthy animals.  Making faces that I swear you'd only see in a zoo. 
[01:00:30]  Our job is taking black people's freedom.  Savages.  Start with a bath.  The diversity.  Payton.  Jesus.  I certainly think there was some editing done during that piece.  It actually softened what you really meant.  I heard.  He's just showing his editing skills.  Maybe.  I didn't hear any edits.  I heard an edit there.  I heard a couple of edits there. 
[01:01:00]  I didn't hear any edits.  Wow.  I just assumed he got a microphone into our office.  That was Kevin T.  That's 5-0-3 when I get in.  Kevin T., we got another one here.  And look at the television.  Actually, we have another one, but we have Don from Overeaters Anonymous.  I knew this phone call was coming.  Yes, Don.  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you?  Pretty good, Don.  Hi, Don.  A friend of mine listens to this show, I got to tell you.  Oh, it's always a friend, right, Don? 
[01:01:30]  First of all, Don, before you say another word.  We're not buying that a friend of mine was listening to the show.  Admit you were listening to the show.  Well, I was in the car with him.  Could you just please give the Jimmy plug and get it over with?  Give the what plug?  The Jimmy Norton plug and get this over with.  Well, actually, what I'm saying is you're giving $10 a pound for women to come down for  being fat.  Yeah.  I mean, you're promoting obesity.  Yeah.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, we want them to eat as the month goes on, too. 
[01:02:00]  That's terrific.  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  Very creative, boy.  Seriously, it's great, really.  Are you being sarcastic?  No, this is a Jimmy plug.  No, now it sounds more authentic.  What's the problem?  Because he's like, no, it's good.  It's fantastic.  You don't like it, right?  Are you really with Overeaters Anonymous?  I mean, I wish I was lying, but I mean, it's just kind of stupid.  I mean, we're driving into work.  I had a call because it's like, why don't you promote cancer or something?  It's the no one can.  No, because cancer is something that people get, and it's beyond their control for the  most part, unless you're a smoker. 
[01:02:30]  All right, you can keep talking.  Unless you're a smoker or something like that.  Disease, we're talking real diseases that you can't just prevent.  Yeah, I do.  You can prevent being fat.  This is Anthony, smarty pants.  No, but Anthony, you've had a problem with booze, right?  I never had a problem with booze.  No, I'm Jim, and I did.  Love booze.  And I had a problem with drugs, and I'm in recovery for both.  What I'm saying is that it's just kind of, these people have problems. 
[01:03:00]  You guys have to realize that.  First of all, it's mental before physical.  I understand it, dude.  I also understand obsession, and I also understand the desire to do something for yourself and  the choices you have to make.  I understand that you have to make a decision that you're going to do something better,  and it's difficult.  But more importantly, it's funny to look at a fat woman scantily clad.  Maybe it's funny, but the idea is, you know, the underbelly that was laying under the skin.  Did you have to use that example? 
[01:03:30]  It's silly, and it's also, it's really hurtful, and it's stupid.  It's destructive.  Silly, hurtful, stupid, destructive.  Thank you.  That's what we strive for.  I thought you just kept the light of the contest on.  In our contests.  I mean, it's just, you've got to understand.  I mean, if someone does what I do for a living, it's just a little offensive.  What do you do for a living?  What do you do?  I was, listen, I'm a recovering fat person myself.  Fat person.  Well, here's the deal I'll tell you.  That's horrific.  I was an overweight kid.  You know, I had a lot of problems growing up.  Yeah, you got beat up a lot.  I changed my life around. 
[01:04:00]  I played football, got in shape, and I changed my whole life.  I was a borderline diabetic, and now, you know, I'm a competitive bodybuilder.  You know, into karate and stuff.  Very proud of you.  There you go.  So, you made a decision that you didn't want to eat a certain way.  Right.  And you sacrificed.  Do you think I like eating salads, dude?  Do you think I want to shove a Snickers bar into my dumb face?  Well, you can do that once in a while.  What I'm saying is that obesity isn't just, it's a disease.  I understand the disease of addiction.  There's always a buzzkill out there.  But I understand the disease of addiction, but this is about. 
[01:04:30]  Am I saying something that's not true?  What is a buzzkill?  Because you're ruining our fun.  You're ruining our fun, sir.  Fat people are jolly.  Dude.  We love Fatty Pig Fatty, and the girls are into doing it.  We're not like handcuffing them and dragging them into the studio.  They're coming on their own.  You lost your jolliness.  Yeah.  Former fat, jolly person.  We want fat, jolly people to hold their bellies and go, ho, ho, ho, and it all shakes.  Yeah, it shakes. 
[01:05:00]  Just admit it's not healthy, and it's not the best idea to encourage people to get fatter.  Are we encouraging people to get fatter, sir, or are we telling people if you're fat, come  down?  Eat 30 meals before you come down.  I mean, come on.  Wait, dude, let me ask you a question.  Is being a plus-size model, does that encourage people to get fat?  I mean, say you can't cut it in the modeling industry, and you're a little overweight, maybe  they say you're not fat enough to be a plus-size model.  Come on, man.  Is that encouraging people to be fat?  Listen, dude, I'm not talking about a little overweight.  I'm talking about three to three. 
[01:05:30]  I mean, that's morbidly overweight.  That's what we're looking for.  Yeah, we got one coming down Monday.  Who else celebrates that?  Fatty pig fatty.  That's right.  We're doing this with dignity and because it's fun.  Yeah, it sounds delightful.  It is.  Delightful's a good word for it.  Yeah, wait.  Here's Jen from Rockaway.  Jen.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, Jen?  You're on with Don from Overeaters Anonymous.  Yeah, he's nice, okay?  I mean, seriously, I am heavy.  I'm happy to be heavy.  I didn't get this way because I'm not, like, I'm standing here in the store and I got my  mounds and my Hershey's Kisses in my hand, you know? 
[01:06:00]  How fat a gal are you, Jen?  Look, sweetie, we talked about this yesterday.  I'm kind of up there, you know?  Wait, which one were you from yesterday?  All I'm saying is that it's unhealthy to be, am I?  Of course it is.  What, are we stupid?  We don't know that it's unhealthy?  I mean, basically, you're paying people that are fat for being fat.  Wait, dude, you're a competitive bodybuilder, right?  Yes.  Look what people in your field do.  And I chastise them for steroids. 
[01:06:30]  Stop chastising everyone.  Stop being such a curmudgeon.  Live your life.  Just worry about Don.  Just be good to Don.  Stop chastising everybody.  Stop being a nudge.  Don the chastiser.  Why wouldn't you, let me just ask you one quick question.  If I went through something, if someone helped me, why wouldn't I pass that on to someone else?  Pass that?  What I'm going to do with having that.  Because it makes boring radio.  That's right.  And it's also.  You've been doing boring radio for years.  Don't worry.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Sir.  Certain things. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, I hope you just hit a poll.  They're programs of attraction rather than promotion.  I don't go out and save the world.  If people see what you have and they want it, they are drawn to it.  I don't go around chastising people.  I don't do that.  I want to know something.  Wait a minute.  That's not my job.  Wait, Jen wants to.  Yes, Jen.  Yes, Jen.  What is he really going to do?  He's going to help me.  What's he going to do?  Hold the sandwich for me, for God's sake.  Yeah, exactly.  She's going to eat.  She might as well earn a few bucks, Don.  That's right.  Now, Jen, how much do you weigh?  Hmm. 
[01:07:30]  It's in the fours.  In the fours.  I haven't been weighed in a while.  $10 a pound, Jen.  $10 a pound.  That number may go up as this contest goes on.  And if you eat more and gain more, you make more money.  That's right.  Don.  If I hook it on in there, I mean, for God's sake.  But if you have somebody that's bigger than me, you guys got to make it worth my while here.  I mean, even if I'm not going to be the guy.  Hey, if you're over 400, I got to tell you, if you show up, you got a really good shot of winning this thing. 
[01:08:00]  Well, guys, I said, I don't want to listen.  I don't want to, you know, kill your fly.  I just throw that coral.  Too late.  Too late, John.  Hi, guys.  I'm really sorry.  I'm not from O.A.  I was still in the old way.  All right.  So there he goes.  I hope you taped it and you play it.  He didn't know what else to say.  Now he's upset he's going to go have a piece of cake, you know?  All right, Jen.  You got to come in.  You got to.  Come on in, Jen.  It's a cute contest.  When's the last time you heard that?  It's a cute contest when you see girls in the 200s.  But it gets really good when we get up into the fours. 
[01:08:30]  The fours are great.  We got possibly a 355-pound girl coming down from Boston.  We got other people from across America already talking about this contest.  They're thinking of making the road trip.  So we got to get the PayPal account up so the listeners can help us so we can get the, you know, the per pound up.  $10 a pound right now.  All right.  I've just been worried that you guys are going to be mean to me.  I was like, yeah.  Nah, we just go around.  We're good-natured.  We're not mean people.  Jen, you show up.  We will not be stupid.  All right.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Get her info.  She wants to do this thing.  She's just scared that she's going to be humiliated. 
[01:09:00]  We're not going to humiliate you.  We goof off, but, you know, come on.  We're not going to humiliate you.  Jen, here's the deal.  Change your name.  Change the town you're from.  Absolutely.  And you can wear one of the masks that we'll provide.  Piggy, piggy mask.  Oh, is it time for the promo again?  Would you get a horsey mask?  It's the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty God Dad.  The Opie and Anthony show is looking for fat, blubbery, undisciplined women to point and laugh at.  Don't worry.  We're willing to pay for the privilege. 
[01:09:30]  Just haul your big, embarrassing ass down to our free FM studio in New York City,  strap a pig mask around your fat skull, squeeze your hindquarters into a bikini,  and have a snack for $15.  The biggest mess to waddle through the door at the end of the contest wins $10  for every humiliating pound on her carcass.  So if you're saddled with 350 pounds of embarrassing flab, you'll get $3,500.  Dry those tears, young lady.  Three grand buys a lot of Kleenex and a lot of pizza.  Brought to you by your compassionate friends at the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, that is a great promo.  By the way, we will play listener promos because Fatty Pig Fatty,  there's some great material there for a promo.  You already got one?  Is it good?  It's all right.  Well, we got the first one coming in.  Danny covering himself.  It's all right.  He's on the fence.  Well, we got to start somewhere.  This is a listener promo for Fatty Pig Fatty,  sent in by Bob S. in Burbank, California. 
[01:10:30]  It is on.  It is on.  How disgustingly fat a pig are you?  We're going to pay $10 a pound.  That's right, bitch.  Game on.  I want some big, fat, disgusting monster.  The type of girl who's too fat to even talk to on the phone.  Why does it have to be a fat woman?  Why can't it be a fat man?  Because that's what we said.  You bring your big, fat slob over to the studio.  She has to wear a bikini.  500-pound girl.  All right, 5,000.  That's it.  Opie and Anthony, weekday. 
[01:11:00]  Hog it up the air.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  You know what?  That's very good.  I like that one.  You said it was all right.  That's a really good promo.  I think that guy's in radio.  That's a fun one.  Because that's a good promo right there.  All right.  Thank you, Bob S. in Burbank, California.  Burbank.  Is that in the contest, by the way, for the MacBook?  I think it is, officially. 
[01:11:30]  It's a promo about the show.  Yeah, there you go.  It fits the...  No, it doesn't fit the criteria?  30.  It's too long?  It's close enough.  How long is it, Finn?  36 seconds.  How long should it be?  All right.  30.  30 seconds.  Stickler.  Plus or minus 6 seconds.  Rewrite the rules.  Hold on.  Goody Gumdrops wants to point something out.  No kidding.  Goody Gumdrops.  Just rewrite the rules.  Sure.  The rules should just say about 30 seconds, which I think it does, by the way. 
[01:12:00]  What do you think A-P-P-R-O-X period means?  All right.  Let's take a break.  Hold on.  Is it the exact time?  Let's ask Joy Killer.  Fatty pig fatty.  Hopefully Sarah shows up to just start the contest.  We'll start it rolling.  I want to see fat women.  We'll all be giddy.  And you can show up today.  Please.  You don't have to call.  Just show up.  Just show up.  Think of this, larger girls.  When's the last time anyone was happy to see you? 
[01:12:30]  Hey, where are the masks?  I saw one.  Danny had one.  All right.  He's got.  Oh, my God.  It's a big horsey mask.  Show that on Pal Talk.  Where did you get the horse mask?  Party City.  Let me see it.  Go around in front of Jimmy.  We need the pig mask, though.  Yeah, they didn't have a pig mask, so I didn't want to show up empty-handed, so I brought this along.  And masks are optional, by the way.  You don't have to throw the mask on. 
[01:13:00]  We would like it.  We would like it very much, but Jimmy's trying on the horse mask.  See, then no one knows who you are.  There you go.  Ah, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'm not going to race him.  I'm going to put him out to stud.  When I used the trigger treat, people always knew it was me.  Move over to the mic so people could hear you, Jimmy.  Right there.  Stop.  No, no, Jimmy.  No, Jimmy.  You got it.  There you go.  There you go.  Take the big blue tag off the front.  I told him that already, Anthony. 
[01:13:30]  He doesn't listen.  Why is that a big blue tag on the front of a horsey head?  Because he's stupid.  Because, you know something?  That looks really creepy.  He's going to try to return it after, you know, ten fatties put the mask on.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're really late.  We'll get back to the MacBook entries.  We got to talk about Blowfly.  He hates us.  Screw Blowfly.  We got to talk about mancations, whatever the hell that is.  And other things.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:14:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Cleveland, we'll see you tomorrow.  Broadcasting live in Cleveland tomorrow.  Tomorrow, see you later.  But don't be confused.  We're going to be doing our show in the morning, and then they replay it in the afternoon up there in Cleveland.  So stop by the radio station.  I think we'll have some tickets to the ONA traveling virus for Saturday's show. 
[01:14:30]  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  The last date on the ONA traveling virus store.  That's the same time as we are now, right?  Cleveland?  Huh?  Yeah, I think so.  So between 6 and 9 a.m., Cleveland, come by the show.  The show is Saturday night at the amphitheater.  I think tickets are still ten bucks.  It's myself, Rich Voss, Bobby Kelly, Billy Bob.  No, dude.  Come down.  You come down.  There's a lot of money, but they're really broke, dude.  Dude, you know, Cleveland's two hours difference, dude. 
[01:15:00]  You don't know the time, Joe Zones?  Cleveland's, I think, are two hours ahead of where we are, dude.  No, I know this, dude.  He's as dumb as they come.  And also, Patrikio Neal, and of course, Otto and George.  Otto, Otto, Otto.  Give me a good time.  It's going to be great, man.  Well, there you go.  Presented by Bud Light.  And we'll be doing Fatty Pig Fatty tomorrow morning.  Yes, we will.  Yeah.  For the Cleveland girls that want in on this contest. 
[01:15:30]  Right now, $10 a pound.  Also, I think we need a Fatty Pig Fatty prize pack.  Yeah.  Just for showing.  Yeah, for all the ladies that show up, we'll give you something for showing up.  Just for showing.  Just for showing up.  I'm going to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland this time.  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Are you really going to go this time?  The ban is over.  Huh?  Oh, right.  The ban is over.  See, remember, Jimmy was boycotting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame because they refused  to induct...  Sabbath.  Sabbath then.  Now, remember, I would stand outside and protest.  I'd walk in a circle with a sign. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  That would be me.  Yeah, you were protesting.  Well, you'll get to see how awful that place is.  I do not want to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  We'll have a good conversation about it on Monday if you go.  I'll go again.  I will not go.  Why not?  It's the hard rock without the food.  Exactly.  Let's go.  Not going.  Let's go.  Me and you.  Wow, another person really pissed off about the Fatty Pig...  What?  What?  Who is it?  Let's get...  The Fatty Pig Fatty Contest has to be the dumbest contest you guys have ever done.  Thank you.  Welcome to the League of Howard Stern, FOs. 
[01:16:30]  What?  The League?  I wish I was on XM so I could say that word.  This kind of S is exactly the reason that I stopped listening to Fartman.  Well, then I guess you'll stop listening to this awful program, too.  The what?  No way.  He had a right before he stopped listening, or is he still listening?  Of course.  I believe Scott from Buffalo is still listening.  Exactly.  Oh, you know what?  He is, because he just...  This is another feedback that is two minutes later from the one I just read. 
[01:17:00]  Norton is a hypocrite when he said on Stand Up, Sit Down, that he doesn't do cruel humor.  No, I don't.  That's BS.  If he goes along with this, I guess he's too smart to believe his own lies.  Uh, no, stupid, you jackass.  If people are volunteering to come in, I said I'm not deliberately cruel.  Meaning if I see a guy in a wheelchair in the audience, I'm not going to go, ah, and say something deliberately hurtful to him.  Subject matter is all acceptable.  That would be the point I was making. 
[01:17:30]  If we're having a contest like this and people are showing up for it, of course, what's wrong with that?  I guess it is a little cruel, but...  You're an idiot, Scott Morgan.  Yeah.  You're an idiot.  I thought he wasn't listening anymore.  Stop listening.  Start sending another feedback.  Who needs ya?  Stop finding things I've said and try to make me stick to them.  I don't like it.  You are a hypocrite.  I'm an ass.  All right, here's the deal.  Scott's right.  I won't tolerate this malarkey.  Yes, you will.  What's up with Blowfly? 
[01:18:00]  Do you want to explain Blowfly?  Blowfly's an idiot.  Well, Blowfly, apparently he was a guy who was doing rap way before rap was popular or anyone else was doing it.  Back in the 50s, this guy's old school.  He's an OG, OP.  Blender Magazine, I think it was.  Yeah.  Said that Blowfly started rap.  Yeah, that's apparently...  The first rap song goes back to the late 50s, early 60s.  And it was Blowfly. 
[01:18:30]  But now, there are some type of...  Steve, take that Jagermeister jacket off.  No.  Oh, my God.  Looked like an extra from the movie Cruisin'.  I'm wearing a yellow bandana in my pocket.  You know what that means?  I want some pizza.  Let's go, let's go, let's go.  Yeah, Blowfly.  So, we played some of his rap songs on XM because they're really, really dirty.  And they're kind of funny to listen to. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  And then we decided, man, what's this Blowfly guy about?  So, we got him on the phone.  We decided to talk to him yesterday.  And we get him on.  And we wanted to have a conversation with the guy because he's like a pioneer.  I want to talk to him as himself.  Right.  Just talk to him.  Ask him questions about music back in the 50s.  Rap music.  How the hell you come up with the concept of rap before people really doing it.  You know, how it was accepted or not accepted.  Things like that.  Real questions.  What he did was every two seconds chime in, step on anyone that was talking at the time with horrible rap. 
[01:19:30]  With rap, you couldn't understand half of what he was saying.  It was all, you know, dirty and stuff.  That's what he does, which is fine.  But it wasn't funny.  It wasn't helping the conversation move along.  It wasn't an interview.  We could have put the guy's record on.  I told his stupid, this guy, Tom, who is his drummer or whatever, we should let him get him on the phone. 
[01:20:00]  Uncle Tom, he calls himself.  Yeah.  He could call us right now.  Uncle Tom.  Call him.  He might not know.  He might call in later at XM.  Well, he goes by the name Uncle Tom.  I know he does.  That's his thing because it's kind of funny.  It ties in with the black and white thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, so Blowfly was all about just freestyling, I guess, and making no sense whatsoever, which is kind of fun.  And you could go with that for a little while.  And then it's like, okay, enough.  Let's talk a little bit.  We couldn't understand.  Anthony said at one point, I can't understand Blowfly.  And Blowfly didn't even stop talking.  No.  Here's what I said to this jackass in the interview, his manager. 
[01:20:30]  It's like, I like the guy's music.  I would still recommend it because I think it's good.  He's not a good interview.  But he's an ass for an interview.  Yeah.  And yeah, when I said he's talking, he's talking, he's going on and on and on.  And we're giving him a chance.  And we do that.  We'll give you a chance.  And then, you know, if we keep that going, you'll start hearing the audience go, oh, boy.  Oh, they're letting him ramble.  So I said, you know, I can't understand a word Blowfly is saying.  I don't know what he's even talking about at this point. 
[01:21:00]  And then we started goofing on him.  You had a great line, too.  You called him Weird Al.  Weird Al Yankanig.  Because he was just like rapping and cursing and trying to be funny the whole time.  Yeah.  Instead of just sitting down and talking.  So I guess he was not happy with his diet.  But they were throwing around the most popular word for, you know, a derogatory black word ever.  He was not happy with his appearance and Uncle Tom wrote Steve from Blowfly's manager to Steve. 
[01:21:30]  This is Uncle Tom.  Steve, I don't know what crawled up your guys' asses today, but their conduct was unprofessional as hell.  Thank you.  I always take that as a compliment.  First, your screener doesn't put me on, which screwed up the timing.  Then one of your jocks called Blowfly Weird Al Yankanig.  And when I finally get on, Norton hangs up on us instead of trading barbs when he can't keep up with TWBN, which equals the world's baddest N. 
[01:22:00]  Because they're going to dump out if we say the N-word.  Can you believe it?  And me telling him he looks like a...  Wow.  How do we say that on the air?  I think you can say it.  And me telling him he looks like a P-word for the male thing.  That's what I'm going to say.  Because I want to keep it...  I want every word to make it on the radio.  Which every comedian in New York has said in public at least once.  Now, here's the thing.  Let's take that first paragraph and tear it apart.  First of all, stupid. 
[01:22:30]  I don't hang up on people because I don't have any type of a button to do that in front of me.  Do you think we trust this idiot with a button that controls anything for this program?  Sorry, Jim.  No, you're right.  I'm not qualified.  I'm a good boy, but I can't do that.  And when you told me I look like a male hog or whatever it was, I didn't even hear it.  No.  I wouldn't have cared.  Who heard that?  Stupid.  What do you think?  You're this dissecting funny guy that just panicked the whole room?  Shoot yourself.  Stupid.  And first, your screener doesn't put me on, which screwed up the timing. 
[01:23:00]  No one knows about you.  We wanted to talk to Blowfly, not the funny white guy he hangs out with.  Uncle Tom.  Bah.  LOL.  What a wacky name.  Yeah, what are you going to add to a conversation when we want to talk to Blowfly about him coming up with rap back in the 50s?  You can add nothing.  We were never.  We were never.  Blowfly leech is what you are.  We were never once scared of you, Uncle Tom.  Stop it.  You guys poured the hell out of us, and we have to entertain the masses, so we had to move on. 
[01:23:30]  Simple as that.  We eat guys like you for breakfast.  Or lunch.  Or dinner.  Snack.  Or maybe a late-night snack.  Anything.  Of course, that paled to our second attempt.  Got any Blowflies in here, Earl?  Sorry, Ron Line.  Love it.  Of course, that paled to our second attempt, where after listening to a fat chick ramble for 20 minutes, which was great radio yesterday,  we who have multiple songs about sex with fat chicks share some of them with you. 
[01:24:00]  We would have multiple songs about sex with fat chicks.  Share some of them with you, and get hung up on again with Blowfly Sucks.  That paragraph really doesn't make sense, but he's bummed that we didn't allow him to talk about fat chicks and play some of his fat chicks songs.  Play some?  They wouldn't have played some.  It would have been Blowfly rambling over and over again about maybe a song with a fat chick in it,  or talking about fat chicks in a way that could not be understood over the radio in his rambling mess of a voice. 
[01:24:30]  That's pretty effed up, especially for self-proclaimed fans of our music like Opie.  Yeah, I like the music of Blowfly.  I didn't know anything about Blowfly until about a week ago, a week or so ago.  Love Blowfly music.  Hate him as a guest on the phone.  Simple as that.  Love the music.  Crappy interview.  I want a rebuttal on air with all of your hosts tomorrow.  I want to know why they could dish it out but can't take it.  Can't take it?  Don't use that tough talk.  Now you are more than welcome to be a guest on the show, because now the gloves come off. 
[01:25:00]  No more even trying to be courteous.  Well, where is he?  And a song or two would be nice as well.  Who are you bargaining from your basement, stupid?  All right, well, we want to get Tom back.  We have to play.  We'll play what we want to play.  What do you think of them apples, mister?  First of all, Uncle Tom, we didn't even ask for you.  His name is Tom Boker.  Didn't even ask for you.  We wanted to talk to Blowfly. 
[01:25:30]  You were a hindrance.  You were just an annoying little extra piece of crap that we didn't want to deal with.  You're not a crazy-ass cracker.  Where is he?  You're not Blowfly.  We can't get him on the phone?  He's not answering his phone.  It's going right into voicemail.  Of course.  Of course.  Pay your bill, Blowfly.  Well.  Pay your phone bill.  Then stupid Blowfly's manager had to write something to the Blowfly fans.  Of course.  So this is on a website somewhere. 
[01:26:00]  Uncle Tom here, as these a-holes are not even worth Blowfly's breath.  After Opie and Anthony read the blender where we're in and played rap dirty, they said they  wanted to talk to us.  So we sent them a bunch of stuff and arranged an interview this morning.  We said we wanted to talk to him.  Right.  Him.  Not us.  Him.  You liar.  You're a liar, Tom.  We didn't want you.  When they put Blowfly on, they completely ignored everything he said, called him Weird Al  Yankanig.  And then after I was finally put on the air, they half-listened to me. 
[01:26:30]  Couldn't keep up with the most basic acronym of TWBN, which equals the world's baddest N.  And when I told Norton, he looked like a dildo?  Yeah.  A dildo.  I didn't even hear it.  Something everyone in New York has said at one point, because he does, they hung up on  us.  This guy writes funny things to his fans.  How do we not let you talk more?  You're a hoot.  This guy is upset because he didn't get airtime.  He didn't get as much airtime as he thought he deserved. 
[01:27:00]  We don't even know who the hell you are.  No one knows you.  We wanted to talk to Blowfly.  Then we called back to make sure they claimed we were just disconnected and we were on hold  for 20 minutes listening to some fat hoe ramble on about her love life.  Gee, we only have three effing songs about effing fat chicks.  Maybe that would be some common ground.  Nope.  They put Blowfly on.  He sang them a little from too fat to eff.  And should I eff this big fat, you know, something that would have to do with his effing music. 
[01:27:30]  And they hung up again and said, Blowfly sucks.  Did you read what he just said, Rodeo?  They put Blowfly on.  He sang them a little from, exactly.  We didn't want him to sing us a little.  He's not seducing us.  He's not a crooner.  We wanted to talk to him.  We don't put comedians on and go, you got any material on fat girls?  Let's go.  Is Blowfly capable, Tom?  I know you're listening.  Is Blowfly capable of just picking up the phone and talking like a human effing being about his life? 
[01:28:00]  That's all we gave a crap about.  The guy every two seconds has to be on and rapping on the phone where you can't understand it?  Boy, that's where you really want to hear anybody doing any type of music.  Rap, R&B, or any type of music is over a phone line.  You idiot.  When Kenny Rogers does phone interviews, you think he just calls in and goes, I'm a coward.  No, he doesn't. 
[01:28:30]  You got to know when to hold him.  So, Kenny, uh.  Kenny, uh.  Know when to fold him.  Kenny, uh, when was the.  Know when to walk.  Shut up.  Shut up.  No one does that.  And now, uh, my roadie is going to get on and tell, uh, you what an idiot you are.  And you're mad for just the opposite reason that you should be, Dumbbell.  We wanted to talk to the guy for real.  We wanted to ask him real questions.  Yep.  We weren't.  It's not like he called in just to be a person and we're saying, perform.  We didn't want him to perform or rap at us.  We wanted to actually have a give and take and ask questions. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  Here comes the threat.  Just because one of these dorks, uh.  Wet his pants on HBO.  All right.  We can say that.  All right.  Wet his pants on HBO.  Uh, they used another word, obviously.  And the other two got some dumbass to effing a confessional.  Does not make them legendary dirty entertainment figures.  Wrong again.  They aren't even a pimple on Blowfly's ass.  Thank God.  So I asked all of our fans to go.  Call their switchboard.  To go to call their switchboard at.  What year is it?  I don't even know if that's the number. 
[01:29:30]  Number, please.  And flood their emails over at www.opinanthony.com and let them know what you think of this BS.  I have demanded a rebuttal on air.  We'll see if they can find the balls to take the verbal, uh, A whipping they deserve.  Yours, Uncle Tom.  Well, guess what, Uncle Tom?  We've been on the radio two hours.  Not one phone call.  Not one email.  Wow, you guys are just on fire.  I honestly did get one email.  Oh, you did?  Besides from this track ass.  And the guy was angry.  I'm a rapper and I'm mad.  And he was a little insulting. 
[01:30:00]  The first thing I wrote back, F you.  You didn't hear the interview.  It's stupid.  And blah, blah, blah.  Then I get another email from that email address going, dude, I didn't write you about blowfly.  Who is this?  It was somebody had bounced an email from this guy's email address to me.  So I answered it and it wasn't even from a guy who said this it was from.  So I got no emails.  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to work anymore.  Well, we tried to get you on the phone for the verbal ass whipping because we're sure you're devastating with your words because you're a crazy ass cracker. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  Isn't he wild?  Oh, you're assimilated into the black community.  Whoa.  Another phony.  Is that him?  He should have woke up early and just waited around for us to call him today.  Oh, my God.  That's Uncle Tom.  Is that blowfly and Uncle Tom a picture?  Who is that in the middle?  A radio DJ.  A radio DJ.  Okay, so Uncle Tom is the guy dressed in the Uncle Sam uniform.  White as could be.  Yeah.  He's a fat white guy. 
[01:31:00]  With glasses.  With glasses.  Wearing an Uncle Sam uniform.  He looks like Bam.  He looks like Bam.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He looks like Bam.  There you go.  That's exactly.  Wow.  That's the guy.  You look like a Republican pundit.  You're the one who's going to give a verbal ass whipping?  Pick up your phone, fat boy.  All right.  Well, you guys could go have some fun with Blowfly, I guess.  It's Tom.  And, by the way.  Go have fun with Blowfly.  I think Tom is a real dick.  I don't think Blowfly said anything. 
[01:31:30]  Blowfly is just an awful interview.  He's just not a good interview.  We're going to sit there and then be criticized later on because we sat through an awful interview.  Right.  And then he wrote back that the show, I wish I had the ones that he sent to me personally  because I smashed him in an email.  And he wrote me back.  Yeah, you're stern.  I want to be.  And I'm like, well, why would you come on the show, dude?  Yeah.  Then why come on the show?  Why are you here, fatso?  And you're dishonest.  Of course he's dishonest.  If you really believe that, why would you come on the show?  Be a spectacle douche. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Chad in China, Beijing.  What's up, guys?  I'm listening live from Beijing, China, from my hotel room.  I've been here for three weeks now, and it's great to be getting the virus from across  the freaking globe.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  That's cool, China kicking in.  But Alex from New York says, you guys suck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  F you, Stern imitators.  I happen to listen.  Just accidentally tripped over your own schlong and fell on the radio.  We understand.  It happens.  He wrote, I'll read a word for word. 
[01:32:30]  You guys suck.  F you, Stern imitator.  I happen to listen.  I could not take more than two minutes.  You guys blow.  Bye, scumbag.  Another dishonest ass.  Keep listening.  You'll keep listening.  You're listening.  Making a lot of opinions after two minutes.  Yeah, two minutes.  Listen, we don't care.  We don't need you to listen.  Goodbye, Alex.  Goodbye.  Leave.  Get into a car and hit a pole.  Goodbye.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We'll continue with the O&A show.  Hopefully, Sarah's on her way in for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest. 
[01:33:00]  Look at how big it is on the website.  Hey, Tom, no one has called the show.  No one has.  I swear to God, no one has called the show.  Maybe his fans just don't know what the website is.  He has an awful.  Oh, you know what?  Maybe the Blowfly fans and the Tom fans don't know what their own website is.  Why don't we help him out?  And if there are any Blowfly fans or Uncle Tom fans listening, we could give out his website. 
[01:33:30]  What's the website?  MySpace.com.  Oh, it's a MySpace.  MySpace.com slash Blowfly.  Blowfly.  There you go.  Have fun.  Why are we listening to Travis?  And are you cursing?  Why did we hear you?  Did Travis just curse on the phone?  Travis, talk again.  Fuck.  Huh?  You turned me on.  Which one are you?  You turned me on.  Yeah, Travis.  Ew.  Travis is cursing. 
[01:34:00]  I certainly know how you feel, though.  Is it your time?  Wait, we could listen to you in there?  I didn't know that.  You could listen to me.  Oh, we should just pot him up every so often.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's do his little potty mouth.  Yeah.  Try to potty and be sexy.  There's a pot they didn't need for, I don't know, what, 20 years?  Oh, gosh.  You turn on this pot and you get to hear nonsense from a dunking booth.  No wonder I didn't know how to turn it on.  Who needs it?  Oh, oh, me.  Who really needs it in the end? 
[01:34:30]  Oh, stop.  Had no idea.  All right.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show on XM 202.  O.B. and Anthony.  Lots of shows still to do. 
[01:35:00]  Waiting for Sarah from Queens to show up to start the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  If you're just tuning in, we'll explain when she gets here.  We have dueling, awful stories.  Yeah, we're going to do that in a second.  But first, a couple more entries in the MacBook Contest.  We promised we'd play a bunch of these today.  All right.  We're looking for you to throw together, like, a production piece about the O.B. and Anthony Show.  About 30 seconds.  Top five entries are going to win a MacBook.  How cool is that?  Nice.  So far, they've been okay. 
[01:35:30]  The one we got about the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is really good.  That was pretty good.  That might be in the lead as far as the ones we've played so far.  Only played two.  Yeah, well, this one is from...  It's too long.  What, what, what?  According to Nathaniel Hitler, it's too long.  Yeah, exactly.  He wants it exterminated.  This next one is from a guy named Chris E.  It's called Steve the King.  As a listener of the O.B. and Anthony Show, you'll experience professionalism and integrity. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, what happened there?  That was the first guy that we listened to.  Which wasn't too bad either, right?  No.  Okay, this is Chris E.  Steve the King.  How did you feel?  I've never felt better.  Why?  Because you're the king.  Skull to the king.  Uh, yeah, whatever that means.  Grr.  Don't get mad, Steve.  Here, let me give you a foot rub.  Oof, what's these?  Yeah, you like that, don't you, king?  It's good to be the king.  Do you want to listen to O&A when they come on?  That's a good idea.  When?  You should know that.  They're on from 6 to 9 on Free FM. 
[01:36:30]  You're absolutely right.  Now that's disgusting.  Yeah, you're right.  Yuck.  Take care.  And Anthony.  Wow.  All right.  Good idea.  Okay, terrific.  Kind of taking Steve clips and adding in your own thing, but no.  No.  A little lackluster.  It missed.  I like his effort.  We don't even need to talk about it.  Trust me.  Just move right on.  I just wanted to make him feel better.  No, screw that.  The next one's from Scott M. 
[01:37:00]  It's called Everyone Has AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  Did you do the Robert Reed version?  Robert AIDS and died.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  John Rader has AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  William Lambert has AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  Lou Graham has AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  I hate Corey, and I hope he dies of AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Obi and Anthony. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, that's not bad.  I never realized how many times Jimmy wishes AIDS on people.  Oh, my God.  I'm a redundant Ricky.  I should die.  Well, you know.  That's not bad, right?  That one's not bad.  Very funny.  Once again, that was Scott M.  More MacBook entries.  This one was from Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Kevin T. 
[01:38:00]  Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Kevin T.  Wow.  Open air today.  Nine, two, three, three, FM.  Do ya?  Stinks.  That?  What'd I tell ya?  Just move on.  Stunk.  I can't.  I have to say that sucked.  Who made that?  A guy named Kevin T.  Dude, you're trying to get your music on the air is what you were trying to do. 
[01:38:30]  I think what Danny's doing, he's giving us some really good ones and then some really bad ones so we can have fun with this.  Oh, did that suck.  We're not having fun.  And that'll be the jackass that calls up in bitches.  You're giving them out to your friends.  You're not giving me a chance.  I sent in three.  It stunk.  All right, next.  This is from Dave B.  We'll play two more today.  Your News, right now, with David Batterson. 
[01:39:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for tuning in.  Our top story, a new bacteria which is said to be taking the country by storm with absolutely no cure in sight, ladies and gentlemen.  It has no foreseen cure at this time.  It's labeled the opium anthony virus or for short, the ONA virus.  And it's apparent that it's spreading across America.  There is no known cure at this time, but we will keep you updated.  That's your news now.  Did Steve hear that one?  Wow.  Yeah.  What are you guys doing? 
[01:39:30]  Just bring us the better ones.  We can't even be bothered with the bad ones.  What did Steve think of that?  Does anybody remember laughter?  Apparently not.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes, it is, isn't it?  Danny, comment?  Well, this is the majority of the stuff that's coming in.  So, you know, when people like, you know, Drew wins, you know, an iMac and then they go, oh, did you hear mine? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, we did.  This is what they're talking about.  And we've had over 100 entries, and these are the more interesting ones to play, right?  What does E-Rock think about them?  Old lady lungs.  This contest is wide open.  You've got a real good chance of winning a MacBook.  Finally, this is the last one for today.  It's Abe C.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Apply directly to the air. 
[01:40:30]  The OPN Anthony Show.  All right.  Apply directly to the air.  From men with...  Come on a little of...  And women over the age of 16, up to 200, are welcome.  Oh, man.  Was that just recorded on a piece of wax?  On a sheet of wax like the old days?  If you just repeated that same phrase...  Right. 
[01:41:00]  Over and over again, like that stupid commercial.  Apply directly to the forehead.  All right.  That's it for today.  I have a question, by the way.  I would like to answer that.  Is Mark around?  Mark Chernoff?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Where's form-fitting slacks?  By the way, get your entries in.  You can send them to 923freefm.com, right?  Yeah.  And they've got to be in by October 2nd?  Yes.  Is that right?  I don't know.  Or are we going to pick the winner October 2nd?  Yes.  I don't know.  By September 29th.  By September 29th.  A week from Monday, you've got to get your entries in. 
[01:41:30]  You send them to 923freefm.com.  As they get Mark, let's decide which story is more horrific.  Two sick stories in the paper today.  Dueling sick stories.  Yes.  One's what?  Oh, Jesus.  One's hot.  Which one do you want me to read first?  Now, really give this a little bit of thought here, because I think the cute kitten story  should be first.  Yeah, I agree.  First?  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Okay.  Because I think that, personally, for me anyway, that comes in a very close second.  Yeah.  All right.  It's from Edwardsville, Illinois.  Of course it is.  Man jailed for beheading girlfriend's kitten.  A man who admitted in court to tearing off the head of a kid after a fight with his  girlfriend has been sentenced to two years in prison.  When it comes to animal abuse cases, we don't get prison sentences all the time, so it's  always good when we do.  Stephanie Smith, a spokeswoman for the Madison County State's Attorney's Office, said Tuesday 
[01:42:30]  of the case against Jacob Thornton.  Thornton's 21.  A judge ordered Thornton sentenced to run concurrently to a prison term related to a parole violation  on a 2005 aggravated battery conviction.  This guy's just angry.  This is an angry, angry guy.  Authorities say that after July 28th dispute between Thornton and his living girlfriend,  the 30-year-old woman left the home before returning to find her kitten's head and detached 
[01:43:00]  body in the front yard.  He just tore his girlfriend's kitten's head off and threw it in the yard.  Left it in the front yard for her to see.  That is an awful story.  How do you think you're going to resolve the argument that way?  Yeah, you think she's going to go, you know, honey, you were right.  As I look at my dead kitten, head over there, little kitten body over here, I now see your  point.  You're absolutely right.  Well, now, is the cat okay? 
[01:43:30]  They didn't report that in the story, which is odd.  You're supposed to do, you know, complete story, but I would assume, no.  Poor little kitten.  There's a little contractor over in Iraq.  With their big kitten forehead, a lot to grip onto.  I bet you when Jacob picked it up, the kitten knew there was problems are coming.  You picked it up by the face.  Got a little scared, did it?  But this story just beats it all. 
[01:44:00]  Beats it all.  A little baby apparently died.  It's always sad when we lose one of the children, one of the babies.  This and from an 18-year-old mom who lived out in a shelter, lived in a homeless shelter,  I guess, and decided to go out drinking one night on a Friday night and left her baby  with people at the Fox House Shelter for Women in East Harlem, right here in our wonderful  city. 
[01:44:30]  Well, she comes home after a drink and inebriated and apparently got sick in the evening, but  it was smart enough, as a lot of people are, to pull a little bucket over.  You ever do that?  You pull your little pail over and you're feeling the bed spins so you can throw up in  the bucket, which she apparently did.  She vomited in the bucket.  Her baby girl died after apparently falling into a bucket of her mother's vomit. 
[01:45:00]  Are you letting?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got home, took the baby back to the room, and threw up in the bucket before falling asleep.  She found a baby in the container at about 2.40 p.m.  Wow.  Wow, did she have to sleep it off.  Three months old, rushed to the hospital, but pronounced dead. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  Calls to the shelter were not answered.  So far, the mom hasn't been charged with any crime.  Nah, you know.  That's just awful.  Dude, dude, it's an accident, dude.  They got to charge you with neglect, dude, because, you know.  In the law states, Section 3, Paragraph 51, dude, it's illegal to vomit on your child, dude.  Is it, Bob?  Is it? 
[01:46:00]  So two, wow, horrific stories.  I think baby dying in vomit trumps anything.  Yeah, anything.  In life.  You got a baby, you got vomit.  What else do you need?  Mom's drunken vomit.  You know, there's just alcohol in it.  Yeah.  Great.  That is crazy, crazy.  Kid died with his face in like a half a ham sandwich.  Oh, God.  Let's say hi to Luke in Ohio.  Luke.  Hey, guys.  How are you going?  Good, Luke.  Hi, Luke. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, I'm heading up to Cleveland there on Saturday with my girl.  Where are you going driving from?  I live about 30 miles south of Columbus, man.  Oh, right on.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, we're doing the show from the station in Cleveland tomorrow morning.  We have to tape it tomorrow morning, and then obviously Cleveland plays it in the afternoon,  so we're hoping people show up at the radio station tomorrow.  We'll have ONA Traveling Virus tickets to give away to people that show up tomorrow.  Yeah, I was hoping I could come up tomorrow to do the walkover and stuff, but I got to work. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, someone else is asking if we're going to do the walkover.  Yeah, between the two shows before we continue on XM, we'll go outside the station and see what's going on.  I think we're going to try to do some comedy with Rich Voss.  I think we're going to do a Starbucks or a diner or something, you know, where he just jumps.  He walks right in and starts doing his act, and no one knows he's coming.  It's a great little bit we do from time to time.  Luke, we'll see you Saturday at the show.  Tickets still available.  All right.  Hey, you guys going to go to the Hard Rock, did you say?  The Hard Rock? 
[01:47:30]  What?  No, I was saying I was going to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Oh, yeah.  The Rock and Roll Hall.  Are you going on Saturday or before the show?  I don't know.  I'm not sure what.  Yeah, right before the show.  I'll probably be there.  The show starts at like, what's that, 7 or 8 o'clock?  I'll probably be at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at like 645.  Well, that's the only day we can go, though.  I can go tomorrow.  Okay.  Yeah.  Jimmy, I love you.  Oh, yeah.  We can maybe go later today or tomorrow.  We're going to figure it out.  Thanks, Luke.  All right.  Thank you.  We'll see you all in Cleveland.  We can't wait.  Luke.  It's the last date on our comedy tour.  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  So it should be a silly one.  Last one this year, right?  Yeah.  Now, someone sent in some more improv, news improv.  It's not going to be as good as the one from yesterday, though.  Yesterday's was a blast.  I just was watching the video of it and how uncomfortable the guy gets when he realizes  he's bombing.  It is one of the best bombs in a news improv ever.  When these news guys try to go off script, off story, and have a little chit-chat with  the anchor back at the studio from the remote location on the street, and this guy just 
[01:48:30]  bomb.  And you see, he turns red, gets all sweaty, and doesn't know what to do with himself.  And the anchor, no support.  Sells him right out.  It's worth playing again.  It is wonderful.  Listen to this.  So that's what's happening.  But the big story is traffic, Pat.  You know, and every time I think of the Waller of Astoria and I think of world leaders,  I think of coming to America, when James Earl Jones came to see to find Eddie Murphy, 
[01:49:00]  and he's like, where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waller of Astoria.  And that's where I guess the president's going to go.  So where else would you meet with world leaders other than the Waller of Astoria?  It makes sense, right?  Yeah.  Foreign policy for the masses, I guess, is his, Roger, right?  The best part is the, uh, yeah, after a long pause.  Yeah, nothing matters after that.  No.  They got a video of that up on YouTube, but it's not the best quality, unfortunately. 
[01:49:30]  You can just hear that the guy knows he's bombing.  He can't get the words out.  When James Earl Jones, like, he starts up and then it's, uh, he goes to meet, to see, uh,  Eddie Murphy, like, he loses it.  He knows, oh my God, why am I, why am I in this?  I'm in too deep.  We interrupt this program to come to the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Wow, who saw this coming?  Uh, Brian in Virginia, what's up? 
[01:50:00]  Hey, guys, I'm in traffic in D.C., and I'm right next to two midgets.  They're driving in a little Kia Sportage, their little fat hands are on the steering wheel,  and he's got his girlfriend or something in the passenger seat.  It's unbelievable.  Do you have access to a Molotov cocktail?  I do.  Hey, little buddies!  He's yelling at him.  Little buddies.  Little buddies.  Nice hands!  Oh.  That rear view mirror must be adjusted so far down.  It must look like they're in a monster truck. 
[01:50:30]  I'll be honest.  They're right alongside of me.  We're stuck here, and the lady has to look at me.  She has no choice.  You know how awful it would be to have to borrow his car?  You'd have to take it back to the manufacturer just to adjust the seats and everything, because  you know it.  You'd just get in there and have to push the seat back.  The mirrors, you'd be like, oh, all day just to push him out far enough.  Push the blocks off the stupid...  Oh, you know there's blocks on the pedals.  Pedals.  You know there's blocks on the pedals.  Little...  No matter how small the steering wheel is, it's like a tractor trailer for him. 
[01:51:00]  He's got to do the hand-over-hand turn no matter where he goes.  Oh, you poor little bastards.  His wife has to tie his little muffin hands to the steering wheel because they can't grip.  Yeah, they can't really grip things, because it's just like a McDonald's muffin and little  Vienna sausages sticking into them.  That's their hands.  You can't bend them.  There's no real knuckle movement.  So how are you going to hold a steering wheel?  He probably has to put his forearms through like the little wheels. 
[01:51:30]  What would you call it?  Like the little area in the wheel?  Yeah, the little area in the wheel, I'd call it.  Yeah.  You know what I bet he's really good at, though?  The only thing?  Honking the horn.  Because he could take that big, flat, puffy hand and just smash the horn.  Beep!  Beep!  When he pushes the horn, air just rushes out of his fingernails.  He just...  The lady just flipped me off.  I don't know what that thing was that she stuck in the air.  Yeah.  A midget flipping off means nothing. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  All right.  Meanwhile, back at the show...  So we got another news improv.  It's Mike Woods before his weather report.  All right.  I don't know if we even...  I don't know if we should play this because I don't think it's going to be anywhere near as good as the one we just played.  Let me tell you something.  Mike Woods makes up in quantity what he might lack in quality of screw-ups.  Like the one yesterday, of course, is a brilliant screw-up.  But I'm not sure if that guy does that every day. 
[01:52:30]  Mike Woods screws up on a daily basis.  Let's take a listen.  Good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us.  I'm Ron Corning.  And I'm Jody Applegate.  It's coming up on 630 on this Thursday, September 21st.  Thanks for joining us.  And the turtleneck on here should be no indication of how cold it is outside because she's a little...  Here's Mike Woods with a check of the forecast.  You got that right.  You look like you're rolling it down like you don't have it on.  You know what?  I actually had a different shirt on this morning. 
[01:53:00]  And at the last minute, I was like, it's cold.  So I just pulled it out.  It's cool enough that cold.  I'm sure you did your little school shopping and everything.  You want to show off the new duds.  I got this for $20 at a factory outlet.  Nice fly.  Can you believe it?  All right.  You were right about this.  Hey.  Oh, no.  Ow.  I better continue on before somebody gets hurt over there.  The honeymoon is over.  Wow.  I wish everybody heard that.  I think they did.  We've got cool air dropping across the tri-state area. 
[01:53:30]  A very cool start to the day.  Oh, the co-anchor threw that line out, right?  About the shirt being cheap or something?  She got ripped off.  She got ripped off?  Yeah.  And he had nothing.  No.  He did the school shopping thing and then just laughed heartily.  Well, we're looking for news improv from your local newscast.  Send it in to the radio show.  Go to opiananthony.com.  Send it to Steve, I guess, at foundrymusic.com. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Is Sarah here from Queens or what?  We need the status on Sarah from Queens.  Fatty pig fatty.  We're ready to do this contest.  We're looking down the hall.  I see him looking down the hall as we speak here.  She's walking down the street as Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray try to shoot her with some type of laser beams.  Right.  Once again, this is Bob S.  Nothing.  I know the movie's old, but Jesus.  Bob S.  He's from Burbank, California, with his fatty pig fatty promo.  Yeah.  We'd like listener participation, and this was sent in today. 
[01:54:30]  You can send in your fatty pig fatty promos as well.  Please.  It is on.  It is on.  How disgustingly fat a pig are you?  We're going to pay $10 a pound.  That's right, bitch.  Game on.  I want some big, fat, disgusting monster.  The type of girl who's too fat to even talk to on the phone.  Why does it have to be a fat woman?  Why can't it be a fat man?  Because that's what we said.  You bring your big, fat slob over to the studio.  She has to wear a bikini.  500-pound girl. 
[01:55:00]  All right.  5,000.  That's it.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekdays.  Hogging up the airwaves.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Fatty pig fatty.  That came in today.  That was a good one.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll see what's going on with Sarah from Queens.  She's supposed to start the contest for us today.  We'll see what happens after these messages.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, I got greedy. 
[01:55:30]  That sucks.  You got greedy with your time and tried to finish business in the bathroom, didn't you?  Yeah, my fifth trip to the bathroom.  Had to cut it off.  You can't get greedy in there.  You need time.  Because now that ruins your whole day, especially if you've got to sit on an airplane.  Oh, look like a kid's painting.  He's squirming in the seat like a hijacker.  Oh, my God.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're getting ready to get out of here.  We'll do a couple more hours on XM, and then we're going to take a little airplane ride today to Cleveland. 
[01:56:00]  We'll be broadcasting live tomorrow morning at the station in Cleveland.  Tomorrow morning.  I know they play the show in the afternoon, but we've got to do it in the morning for everybody else.  So please stop by the station and join the festivities.  We'll have 018 Traveling Virus tickets for you guys if you show up, okay?  I don't think we're going to get a big crowd because it's effed up, man.  No, the timing's all weird.  What they're going to get is probably people that show up in the afternoon when we're not there.  When a tape is rolling. 
[01:56:30]  Guess what?  What?  Sarah from Queens has arrived.  Well, God damn it.  What are we waiting for?  Get it in here.  Hold on.  You know how little time we have left?  Yeah, hold on.  John on Long Island.  Make it really fast.  John?  Hey, listen.  You guys suck because you ruined my ride into work.  I'm looking in traffic here, and I'm looking in all these cars, and I'm saying to myself,  God, I can make a lot of money with this one.  Or maybe this one's a lot heavier. 
[01:57:00]  I can split it with her and make just as much as the other one.  Yeah, I'm starting to look at the girls walking down the street, and I look and go like,  wow, $3,200.  You go like, all right, that's $2,500.  You're looking at them like money.  I'm looking at them like a commodity.  Yeah, cash value.  It's $10 a pound at this point, but I think that figure's going to go up.  And we're going to get some more prizes involved as well.  Before we bring in Sarah, here's the official promo one more time from Steve.  Let me ask you a quick question, though. 
[01:57:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Goddash.  The Opie and Anthony Show is looking for fat, blubbery, undisciplined women to point and laugh at.  Don't worry, we're willing to pay for the privilege.  Just haul your big, embarrassing ass down to our free FM studio in New York City,  strap a pig mask around your fat skull, squeeze your hindquarters into a bikini,  and have a snack for $15.  The biggest mess to waddle through the door at the end of the contest wins $10 for every humiliating pound on her carcass.  So if you're saddled with 350 pounds of embarrassing flab, you'll get $3,500. 
[01:58:00]  Dry those tears, young lady.  Three grand buys a lot of Kleenex and a lot of pizza.  Brought to you by your compassionate friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, this contest is going to go until Halloween, right around Halloween.  So Sarah's here.  She's going to set the bar.  And then now the girls have to beat Sarah's weight.  Or at least bend it.  You guys want to meet Sarah?  Are we ready?  Bring in Sarah. 
[01:58:30]  Dun, dun.  We need some like...  All right.  We need some entrance music and all that for these girls.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Sarah is...  You're lovely, Sarah.  You're sexy.  What are you, Samoan?  Yeah, get on mic here.  You're very sexy.  Yeah, Sarah.  I'm Peruvian.  Huh?  Peruvian.  Peruvian.  From the mountains of Peru.  All the way from the mountains of Peru.  Wow, you don't look like...  How much do you weigh?  Right into that mic. 
[01:59:00]  Make believe it's a big black...  Ew.  I like her even more.  You look good for two...  You look great.  See?  We're not humiliating you.  No, you're sexy.  I have a belly.  It's a lot.  I have a belly, but you got massive boobs.  You're not a flatso.  That's always good.  Yeah.  You don't want to be fat without the...  And have no boobs.  You know what it is?  She's proportioned.  Yeah.  Is what it is.  Thank you.  Can we see from the back?  Oh, she has a lovely rump. 
[01:59:30]  All right.  Sarah's sexy.  She got a wide ass.  I love the teaser, but she's...  I'm filling up a little bit.  Are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy fills up.  Now he's got to start.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's doing what he has to do.  We've seen it a million times.  I am filling up looking at Sarah.  Thank you.  Not what we expected, Sarah.  No?  We were hoping to start this contest off at a bang and do a lot of pointing and laughing.  No, she's not the one that's 350, you idiots.  No, that's...  Pay attention.  That's coming in on Monday, supposedly, but we got Sarah to start the contest. 
[02:00:00]  This is the start, you know.  The first guy to run, was it a four-minute mile?  Of course not.  No.  How long did that take?  The first time someone ran a mile, probably a lot more.  13 minutes and 28 seconds.  Exactly.  It was a caveman.  So you got to...  Right.  And you got to wait with a mastodon chasing him.  And we're hoping to get a mastodon here in the studio, but...  I don't know. 
[02:00:30]  You're not like a wreck.  No.  Nowhere's near a wreck.  No.  I was a size 20 at one point.  You were a size 20.  At one point, yeah.  How old a gal are you?  26.  26.  And are you heavier now or lighter than you are?  I'm heavier now.  You're heavier now than you were.  How much did you weigh, like, in high school?  I can't remember.  I used to wear, like, a size 6'7".  I don't know sizes.  You're about a size 14.  Now I'm about a size 14-16. 
[02:01:00]  Size 14.  Size 14.  Nice.  What did you...  What did you...  I need some help with this couch.  We have to get the official weight, though, for a second.  Yeah, we got to get the official weight.  Can we get you in a bikini or bras and panties?  What can we do with you, Sarah?  Yeah.  I heard, actually, that I didn't have to sew.  Didn't have to.  As long as you have on, you got to take your shoes off so we can get an accurate weight.  Yeah, she's got a very light dress on.  Yeah, she looks...  Oh, look at those bosoms.  Yeah.  What size are the bosoms there?  36 double D. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, 36 double D.  Mm-hmm.  God damn her.  Jimmy, right?  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Definitely.  If she had low enough self-esteem, I'd jump on her in a second.  What happened to the side prizes to try to coax into at least brawn panties on the scale?  We got to get the contest starting somehow.  Yeah.  It's going to get uglier as we go on.  Yeah.  Sarah is probably the hottest we're going to see.  Yeah, I think so.  I really do.  All downhill from here.  All right.  I'm just trying to keep up with the spirit of this event.  Can you put the pig mask on for Goof, though? 
[02:02:00]  Sure.  All right.  Bring the scale over so we can weigh her while she's on mic.  Let's get the pig mask for Sarah.  We're going to take a picture.  We're going to throw it up on our website.  This will be the girl to beat.  So what you guys have to do is you throw a picture up, Steve, with her weight right there  underneath her picture so the other girls out there know what they got to beat.  I don't feel too bad.  $10 a pound.  Sarah now has the pig mask on.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Hold on.  No, get it right next to the mic so we can still talk. 
[02:02:30]  I don't feel good about that.  Why?  I like the pig mask.  The pig mask is cute.  Let's set it off.  Just keep the pig mask on.  We'll guide you to the scale.  I know I said it before, but God damn, that mask looks like John Valby.  All right.  It's the hat and the hair.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  The official way for Sarah and Queens to start off the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  What is it?  Iraq?  Do you want to look at the weight, Eric?  Instead of walking around?  Jesus, Eric. 
[02:03:00]  227.  What?  227.  227 pounds.  That would be $2,270 if no one beats you, Sarah.  Yeah, you don't know.  No one might show up.  And we're going to give you something for coming in.  We just don't know what that is yet because we're developing the contest as we go here.  We're just amazed at that mask.  I don't feel good about that.  It gets hot in there, right?  Jimmy.  Might lose some weight in your head.  We asked her.  Keep that mask on.  We asked her if she wanted to put the mask on. 
[02:03:30]  She said yes.  She said sure.  She's doing a good sport.  Did you get a full body picture of her with the pig mask on there?  You want to pose for Eric with the pig mask on?  Where do you want her, Eric?  Sure.  We got to get nice pictures for opiananthony.com.  And did we get a nice video for YouTube, Sam?  Okay, very good.  We're rocking.  Yeah.  All right, yeah.  The people at PalTalk are saying that she's cute.  Yeah, she's very cute.  Borderline.  Well, somebody's offering $50 for her to do things that are illegal. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  I'd hit it if it was 90 pounds lighter.  No, Sarah's that type of girl.  75 pounds lighter.  You look at Sarah, you go, all right, she's a big girl, but she doesn't cause you to take  any type of an uncomfortable second look.  She's just like every other chick you see.  She doesn't look 227.  She carries the weight very, very well.  Lose 100 pounds, but she looks good.  I'd F her.  Do you have a boyfriend, Sarah?  No.  No boyfriend, huh?  No, I don't have a boyfriend. 
[02:04:30]  What happened?  I've been talking to a guy for like five years, but...  Five years?  You've been talking to him for five years?  Was he in a wheelchair?  Why don't you get moving?  Move slow.  He's got to be gay.  No, he's not gay.  Have you had sex with him?  No.  Where do you talk to him?  Huh?  Are you a virgin?  No.  Okay.  Ooh.  Not really.  Not really?  Uh-oh.  What's that mean?  I don't have sex with him.  Only sex one time or one person?  With who, daddy?  No!  Don't be. 
[02:05:00]  What happened?  You woke up at a party?  No, um...  With a bundt cake?  What?  I used to be engaged.  Nothing?  I stink today.  No.  Oh, you used to be engaged?  And then you had, uh, sex with, uh, the person you were engaged to, and then he broke  off the engagement?  Yeah.  Oof.  Well, you should have waited.  That's how you girls have to trap the guys.  Yeah.  You wait until afterwards.  Because you see what happened?  Or save one out of the two.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  Tell him you'll, yeah.  You got three.  You could, you could, you could do two out of the three.  You gotta save one.  Yeah, two out of three, you're still gonna get married.  You didn't give up everything, did you?  No.  No.  No.  So you're still okay?  You're still a virgin, uh...  Yes.  All right.  Unfortunately, we have to wrap up.  Sarah from Queens, thank you so much.  The contest is on.  Fatty Picked Fatty has begun.  The weight is 227 pounds, so there's a lady on the line, Big Rhonda, she wants in on the  contest.  It's simple as this.  You have to show up while we're broadcasting from 6 to 9 a.m. 
[02:06:00]  6 to 9 a.m. here in New York City, although tomorrow we're in Cleveland, so you can show  up when we're broadcasting in Cleveland from 6 to 9 a.m.  But the weight to beat is 227 pounds.  We're paying $10 a pound right now for the largest or the fattest girl or the heaviest  girl to come into our studio.  USDA Prime Fatty.  And knowing our listeners and knowing our friends of the show, I think the $10 a pound  is gonna go way, way up by the end of the contest, okay?  Everyone's saying she's cute. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, Sarah, thanks for being a good sport.  We'll have your picture up on opiananthony.com.  We'll have the video up on opiananthony.com and up on YouTube, and that's it.  We continue on XM.  If you're not joining us, have a great day.  Cleveland will be there tomorrow from 6 to 9 a.m.  Stop by the station and say hi if you're a faithful listener of the show.  We'll have some O&A Traveling Virus tickets to give away, okay?  Thanks for checking us out, guys.  We appreciate it.  We appreciate it.  We appreciate it.  We appreciate it. 
[02:07:00]  We appreciate it.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Yeah.  Ooh, let's walk.  Look.  Hey, we're walking.  Yes, we are.  I want to get in the sunlight.  Yeah, it's cold in the shade.  Let's get in the sun. 
[02:07:30]  That's right.  We're a traveling radio show.  Done.  Ooh, nice camel toe.  It is cold out here today.  It really is, right?  Breezy.  Yeah, what are you going to do about the weather?  Jimmy's feeling a little sick, too, now.  I think whatever O-Pad, like that little, it's like that week fever.  Oh, no.  I've had that for years.  It's overrated.  Tylenol.  Clear it right up.  But I think I have it, too.  I think it's a quick one, though. 
[02:08:00]  I feel a little better.  I feel a lot better today, although still sick.  Well, I mean, I should feel better on the plane sitting in my first-class accommodations.  Of course.  It's always better in the first-class cabin.  Just because you don't have to mingle with people.  No.  Like Steve.  Steve would be in the back.  I'm obsessed with Steve.  Fucking Steve is all I think about when I'm home.  And I begged him and made them finally email me his stupid voice. 
[02:08:30]  And you just play it?  Dude, I just want to hear, that's terrible, I'm sorry.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  And I have to get a mix of, why not, how did your parents die?  Why not, how did your parents die?  I want to hear that pronto at XM.  His acting range.  He's all I think of at home.  Steve and dysfunctional relationships.  Wow, look at this smart outfit.  Wow.  Spit my gum on her.  That's a smart suit.  Purple.  Hey, are we going to get a foaming pussy today?  We're looking for a woman who would want to do this. 
[02:09:00]  Day two, in search of the foaming pussy.  Any girls?  Did Steve call his sluts?  Steve?  Steve?  Yes, yes, yes.  I asked Steve to call one of his sluts so we could do foaming pussy today.  We got to get that done.  Mentos and Diet Coke.  Yep, and a girl doing some kind of a headstand.  Or something, yeah.  Human volcano.  Maybe she could just be on all fours.  And it could shoot out like she's a rocket car. 
[02:09:30]  So we don't be fresh.  We'll settle for something that looks like a rabid dog.  Yeah.  How about this?  We get her on a headstand.  Take a hairy push.  And we push her out the window and then just watch her spin like a fireworks display.  Oh, look at these nice little gams.  Oh, little plaid skirt and skinny.  Yeah, she had a plaid, like a schoolgirl, Catholic schoolgirl skirt.  Wow.  Morning.  Hello, ma'am.  Hello.  I scared her. 
[02:10:00]  I love doing that.  Wow, wait.  What does this girl want?  What do these lovely girls want?  What?  What does she want?  Oh, no, no.  What do you want?  Hi, ladies.  We are promoting a show.  Oh.  You can't tell us what the show is?  It's a secret?  We're looking on our letter in the city.  Oh, letters.  I have an A, an I, and a D.  What do you have?  Hi.  We're promoting a new TV show.  And if you email Whitney at zoommail.net. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, God.  You annoying cunt.  We hate you.  Wait.  You're really hot, but we hate you.  Would you guys be willing to come upstairs and flash for plugs?  We have a lot of listeners.  No?  Oh.  Oh, we have so many.  You should have flashed for plugs.  We would have gotten you a tremendous amount of email activity.  You're really hot, but you're very annoying.  Go away.  Oh, my God.  Didn't.  Drop something.  We're promoting a show, but we can't tell you what it is. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, that's a great way to promote.  Didn't the baby fall into that thing at the end there?  Did some of these guys want to come upstairs today?  Wait.  We were really rude to the guys that are walking with us today.  We're rude to them every day.  They're the same guys.  There was a.  A couple of different ones out there.  Yes, Jimmy?  A baby fell into that bucket.  Had that bucket of vomit.  Get to the front here.  That's a baby fell into it.  No, that's the.  And there's a tie in the bucket.  That's the.  Why did somebody throw a tie into that?  That's the guy, the security guy at the front desk here in our building. 
[02:11:30]  We need to get the security guy here.  No, that's him.  You always seem to mistake him for vomit or shit, I believe.  Keith, tell those freaks that you come upstairs.  Now, Jimmy.  You guys figure it out.  Be nice when you walk by.  I'm going to get this email out, by the way, over the air.  Be nice when you walk by.  All right, come on.  Let's see.  You guys hear every day.  You've got to be cordial.  I'll start the niceness.  Okay.  Good morning, sir.  They need to get somebody here.  Good morning.  Just leave him.  Hello, sir.  Dead baby in a bucket of vomit sitting there. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  Well, what do you got?  What is that?  That's the email she was handing out.  She handed that?  I'll read this on the air upstairs.  Maybe some more XM friends.  Oh, we'll email?  Yeah, it's breaking up.  We'll see if she does in a couple.  Hey.  Oh, Lord.  XM to the key.  Massacent.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of DPP.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance. 
[02:12:30]  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo.  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Elvirus.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[02:13:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The Opie... 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Now, I'm making jokes and trying to embarrass each other in front of everybody that we forgot to hit five on the elevator.  So we had to take a ride up to the 15th floor because we're too stupid. 
[02:15:00]  We're all having so much goddamn fun that not one idiot remembered to hit the number five on the elevator.  So we rode up and made fun of the women that were on the elevator.  I think I got nasty with one because she was really nervous being in the elevator with just us.  She was the last one to get off on the 15th floor.  And she was standing right at the door as it opened. 
[02:15:30]  And I was like, can't get off quick enough, can you?  And she was angry with me.  I'm sorry to interrupt, Jan.  Can somebody tell a shit dick?  Where's the soups?  Yeah.  Hey, you know something?  That son of a bitch, Steve, had two bags full of soup.  I know.  And I said, what's in there?  And he goes, oh, it's a delicious soup.  They're sending it over every day.  And I said, ooh.  And I went to look inside.  He goes, there's soup in there.  I said, I know.  He goes, I'm bringing it over.  I said, oh, when?  Well, they better start sending a couple more. 
[02:16:00]  We're going to have a fucking problem with the soup man.  If those soups don't make their way in here for us and someone else takes them, they'll be hell to pay.  By the way, the two girls that were walking trying to promote something, really contributing nothing to the Opie and Anthony program.  But this is what it says.  This is meant to play on vulnerable guys.  Is it?  It says, how do I know you?  Let's get in touch.  Ah. 
[02:16:30]  Whitney.  So maybe some of our friends out there would like to get in touch with Whitney because they're promoting something.  Now, how would anyone get in touch with Whitney when you just heard her name?  Whitney at zoommail.net.  Whitney at zoommail, Z-O-O-M-M-A-I-L dot net.  That's wonderful.  Perhaps some of our listeners.  Hold on a second, Steve.  Now, how do we get in touch with the soup people? 
[02:17:00]  I would like a soup.  You don't have one.  There's only two in there.  I don't want mine today.  Two big things of soup.  Two big, uh...  Why are you humiliating me?  Because it's fun.  There's a lot of stuff.  Look, Brad.  So, Jimmy, what is this about?  They're promoting something.  Are they, uh, you know, who was?  Whitney.  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  They're not whores.  They're promoting something.  But they're using the fact that they're cute girls to get you to...  You'll email them and they'll send you back a promotion thing, I bet you.  What if it's for Gold Rush or something? 
[02:17:30]  Do you think it...  No, it can't be.  We're promoting something, but we can't tell you what we're promoting.  It can't be.  It's one of those things.  You're absolutely right.  They make it sound like it's something big, like a TV show, which is what they said,  and it turns out to be some kind of spam thing that they want you to answer that ends up  like those sex emails you get.  Hi.  Looking for someone to fuck?  Get those emails.  Hey, what's the middle soup?  You better have an answer, kid.  That looks good.  Can I throw in your lap?  Oh, Steve. 
[02:18:00]  Only if you drink it right up.  What is the middle soup?  What's the middle one?  You better know.  You better fucking know.  Give me it to me.  I'll figure it out.  Is it turkey chili or is it something else?  That's the turkey chili.  I don't know, Steve.  Doesn't that narrow down everything in life?  Is it turkey chili or is it something else?  Well, yes.  Let's go to Chad in Denver.  He wants to go old school.  Chad.  Hey.  Hey.  That guy is good soup.  That guy is good soup.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  That's right.  That is old school. 
[02:18:30]  You're kicking it, sir.  Harry in Detroit.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Jimmy, smell that one.  That old gag.  Go ahead, Harry.  Yeah, I just wanted to know what it meant when Jimmy told somebody today that they dropped  something.  I hear him say it every now and again and I don't know what it means because I'm an idiot.  Spicy.  He doesn't know what you dropped something means.  It means that something is not being held that was being held and they should pick it  up.  All right.  Bunch it out.  All right.  Thanks for the great question.  This is not turkey chili. 
[02:19:00]  It is very spicy.  How are you guys doing?  What's up, Armin?  I paid $160 week one for you guys' tickets.  I'm 10th row back.  Loving everything that's going on.  My old lady's friend buys the presale tickets.  Not the presale, but the reserve tickets.  And she got them for 30 stones, dude.  I'm hurt, man.  Why did you pay $160 for virus tickets?  I paid for two tickets and I got them 10th row back.  They were the reserve seating, dude. 
[02:19:30]  So $80 a ticket, including the charges?  Anyway, it was $65 plus $10.60 plus cash.  Holy shit, it's just good.  I don't know what to tell you.  If you show up at the station tomorrow, maybe we could give you some free tickets to help  you out a little bit.  Unfortunately, I can't make it to the station tomorrow, boys.  I got to work.  I got a job, man.  Well, then you're shit out of luck.  What do you want me to do?  Show up at your fucking house?  That's a damn good question.  Jesus Christ.  Well, what do you want from us?  I'm trying to make good, but you can't even show up at the station. 
[02:20:00]  Dude, a couple of autographs at the show or something, man.  Meet you guys.  Maybe something like that.  I don't know.  We do that.  We do that anyway.  Oh, fine.  Maybe I'll get to meet you guys.  That'll be fun.  You will.  You know what it is?  We'll laugh.  There's a promotional thing going on.  We didn't realize that Cleveland is one of the poorest cities in the country.  We would have done this anyway, but now at least we feel good about doing it.  What happened to Cleveland?  Absolutely.  Well, thanks, fellas.  I'm sorry, bro.  We'll try to figure something out for you.  I don't know. 
[02:20:30]  Let's go to Tripp in Texas.  Tripp.  Hey, I have a bitch about the fatty this morning.  If she doesn't, they don't want to get in a bikini and or the mask, they should only get  like a penny a pound.  You know something?  I'm with this guy.  I was disappointed.  I know we got to start somewhere.  I understand.  You're not going to get contestants.  I want something.  It's a great idea.  Hey, I'll bunch you now.  If you make every girl get into a bikini, we're going to have two contestants.  I guarantee you.  Not saying that. 
[02:21:00]  Just saying that when a girl is up there like that girl.  Right.  We need more time.  I understand we were running out of show, but we need some bargaining time.  Believe me, I'll get that fat pig's clothes off.  I can do it.  I have the power.  Oh, Ant.  Well, we need some incentives.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Yeah.  We need incentives.  We need to bargain.  But if you make it part of the bit where they have to do that.  Not mandatory.  We're not going to get them.  I'm telling you.  But if they do it, they get something extra.  Now we're talking.  Now their trip's worthwhile. 
[02:21:30]  Now we're seeing some fat ass.  Some of these girls want to feel like the contest is classy.  Fuck classy.  Well, let them think that.  I want to see a big fat ass.  Let them think that is what I'm saying.  Let them think it's a little classy.  Let me tell you something.  I could have gone to the bank and seen her.  Could have gone to the bank.  One of the tellers.  Somebody making a deposit.  Something like that.  We need to go a little further.  Got to see that fat, rippled ass.  She was cute though.  Sarah was cute.  I'm not disagreeing with you, but I just don't know. 
[02:22:00]  You know, if we're going to get a lot of contestants.  We got to figure out incentives.  All right.  You're in here.  You're this weight.  You know, she put the pig mask on, which is going to make for a great picture on the  internet.  And the contest begins there.  The incentive could be four grand if they're 400 pounds.  That's a lot of fucking incentive.  That's a lot of money.  Yeah, but they're not all going to throw the bikini on.  I'm telling you.  How about this?  Maybe a cash prize for just throwing the bikini on.  If they do it, we let them suck my cock.  There you go.  There's a prize.  Because they get aged, they lose weight. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  Let's go to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy.  Hey, what's up, bu-bu-boy?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Just letting you know that there's a surprise that we'll be waiting for you guys when you  get off the highway today to go downtown to the Cleveland studio.  That doesn't sound too threatening.  Yeah, no kidding.  What is it?  No, it's not threatening.  I can't really tell you.  You guys will just be amazed when you see it.  Are you a sniper?  Yeah, I was going to say, are you the latest highway sniper?  Lucky us.  No, no, no, no.  Is there one in Columbus?  There was one up in Columbus, right?  Yeah, like two years ago or whatever. 
[02:23:00]  All right.  So this is a bunch of people.  Is this going to be a surprise?  Yeah, it's going to be something that more or less thanks you guys and stuff.  You'll just see.  You won't miss it.  Trust me.  All right.  Thanks, Jeremy.  You guys are blind.  I think we can figure it out.  You're coming by the station tomorrow?  Coming by the station tomorrow?  Oh, he was doing the flunkus.  Yeah, but it's cell phone stuff.  Flunkus.  Big Rhonda, what's up?  Hey, this is Big Rhonda calling out of Jersey.  How you guys doing?  Hey, Big Rhonda.  What up?  I love you. 
[02:23:30]  What's up, Big Rhonda?  Thank you, Big Rhonda.  Don't I even have a fat voice?  Yeah.  No, you have a sexy voice.  Yeah, you're all right.  I do?  Yeah, you got like a phone sex voice.  Thank you.  Okay, I'm calling about that contest, the fatty pig fatty contest.  Yeah.  Well, now you don't have a phone sex voice.  You know, every fat cell in my body is quivering for that money.  Call him for the contest.  $3.50, all right?  How much do you weigh, baby?  $3.50.  Oh, got to come.  Are you willing to put on the...  I got to come, and I got a hernia in the belly button, all right?  Looks like a small dick for real.  Are you going to put on a bikini for us?  She's a winner.  I'll go naked.  She wants the money. 
[02:24:00]  I love it.  There you go.  There you go.  Look at this.  She wants to go naked with a big hernia.  No shame in my big game.  See, we need a lot more girls like Big Rhonda that understand exactly what we're doing,  and then Anthony is completely right.  I just don't know if all the girls are going to be as cool as Big Rhonda.  Nah, they're not going to be as cool as me.  How big is your hernia there, Big Rhonda?  Let me check it out right now.  It's sticking out about three inches.  Three inches?  And how big a round is it?  Out of your belly button, all right?  Out of your belly button?  What the hell did you lift, Sarah?  Small baby's dick.  Small baby's dick sticking out of your belly area, belly button area. 
[02:24:30]  That's awesome.  Belly button, yep.  Hey, should we have her come down to the XM show or what?  Yeah, why not?  Absolutely, that's how we get them, any way we come.  Yeah, we should get them any way we can, you're right.  Yeah.  Big Rhonda?  All right, I need an address.  How far are you from the city?  About 20 minutes.  Holy shit, come down now.  All right, hold on the line, okay?  All right, baby.  Is that your husband I'm listening to?  Hell no, that's my son.  He got me into you guys.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:25:00]  Nice.  How big is he?  Trust me, she's a fucking manatee.  Wow, good boy.  He called me a womanatee.  Wow, big Rhonda comes in, now we're up to 350 pounds.  Oh, this is fun.  How old is your son?  That's $3,500.  You know what I'm talking about.  How old is your boy there?  26.  26, and your mom been big your whole life?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Was it rough in school?  Did kids make fun? 
[02:25:30]  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, see?  He knows.  Your moms are selfish sometimes, the big fat moms.  Rhonda, come down now.  We'd love to meet you.  Yeah, definitely.  You got a sense of humor.  That's great.  You got a bikini or something you could get into?  I know, man.  I wear the big bloomers.  All right, well, yeah.  But I could put those down.  We were thinking next week, like Tuesday, we can get her something sexy.  I could go up to, like, Milan Briant, you know?  All right, why don't you come down today, and then we'll have you...  How about the thong?  How about I get a thong?  All right, that's fine. 
[02:26:00]  Bron panties is fine, too.  Whatever you got.  Yeah, come on down today.  Today.  Come on down.  Where were you guys at?  All right, hold on the line, okay?  All right, baby.  Where are we?  57th Street and, like, I don't know, between 6th and 7th Avenue.  She is sexy, though, man, the way she talks.  Yeah, hold on the line, Big Ron.  She's got a sexy vibe, too.  Okay, baby.  Yeah, I am.  That turns me on.  Make sure she leaves right away, because, you know, we're only here until about 1030, 1045 today.  Yeah, because we got to take her on a fucking plane, man.  Even though, for me, it's faster on the plane, because I sit in the front. 
[02:26:30]  Let's say hi to...  We get there first.  Let's say hi to Whitey in South Carolina.  Whitey.  Hey, Whitey.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, had an idea for these fatties.  Maybe offer them a buck a pound just to get into a bikini or some other position.  Well, we're going to need a lot of money, then, man.  Yeah, this is all about money.  We're going to have to do the PayPal, then.  That's not a bad idea.  A quick, like in Big Ron's case, a quick $350 for just throwing a bikini on.  A little side contest.  Get them to do exactly what you want. 
[02:27:00]  Money talk.  All right.  And we got to get more sponsors.  Some of our, you know, regular listeners.  We used to have, like, stockbroker Dave back in the day.  Yeah.  He would throw $1,000 down like it was nothing.  Like it was nothing.  Like he was, you know, buying a cup of coffee.  Yeah, like nothing.  Just to help out.  He was always good for a few thousand.  Lead belly.  Opie, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  I need you to do me a favor.  Yeah.  Go to the fullblownage.com website. 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  Scroll down on the index page.  Yeah.  And you will see that we at Full Blown Aids created a I took a bone a pill t-shirt just like you wanted.  Well, I need one of those.  Well, there you go.  You can order them right off the website now.  You guys only got the fat sizes, though.  Thanks.  Well, not really.  Have you seen their members?  The audience.

[02:28:00]  Yeah, you guys do a great job over there.  Fantastic.  All right.  Thank you.  I like Wack Bag.  I like both.  I'm not a Civil War kind of guy.  Let's go to Phillip in Alabama.  Phillip.  Oh, my God.  This is good.  Hey.  What's up, buddies?  Hey.  On the walkover, one of y'all said something about during that foamy pussy thing, having the  bitch on all fours and having that shit shoot out like a rocket car.  Yeah.  Why not have Big A and like a full-time car get squirts in the fucking face?  No, that would be funny. 
[02:28:30]  We've had them get pissed on.  Yeah, we had them get...  Or squirted.  Yeah, there's a little squirt action going on.  Yeah, you think I'm brilliant enough to come up with an idea on my own?  Hell no.  Or guys, I'm squirt.  Well, this is day two, looking for foaming pussy as well.  See, I think foaming pussy, people aren't focusing on because we're doing fatty pig fatty.  Foaming pussy is going to be hard to get.  This is day two, looking for a foaming pussy.  We'll get it.  Need a girl to come in.  We got some Diet Coke and some Mentos, and we want to do some experiments. 
[02:29:00]  A couple experiments.  What are we giving her?  Big hand?  Yeah, we'll just all stand up and give her...  Adulation?  We'll give her a standing ovation.  Table?  A towel?  Here you go, wipe your box.  All right, we'll take a break here.  Fucking box looks like Cujo's mouth.  Give it a wiping, would you?  We'll take a break so you guys can eat your soup.  Oh, this soup is good.  Gotta eat.  From the soup, man.  I had bisque.  I know it's too creamy, but I'm feeling better, actually.  Maybe I needed to eat. 
[02:29:30]  Maybe.  The soup guy, great.  The bisque.  I had bisque.  All right, we'll continue with some things.  We got an angry elevator call on the way.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no.  I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little pop right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  That's what they call me. 
[02:30:00]  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the PF thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite oral treat.  My favorite eating cock. 
[02:30:30]  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  That's all right.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Do your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Oh, God.  After I suck you up, I want you to bang me up the ass. 
[02:31:00]  I'm hungry for a hard-nailed cock.  Yes.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak.  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh.  I like the banana.  Oh, God.  I like the banana.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy hoving in my mouth.  I enjoy cock between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  Patty. 
[02:31:30]  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  She's a freak.  Patty.  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:32:00]  Relax.  A couple more stories in the news, by the way.  Tiger Woods very pissed off.  Were those pictures of his chick?  No.  Sober and posed, right?  They've been trying this old gag for many years.  She's lovely, this girl.  But here's the latest on Tiger Woods.  It wasn't golf on Tiger Woods' mind when he sat down with reporters in Ireland ahead of the Ryder Cup.  It's hard to be very diplomatic about this when you've got so much emotion involved when my wife is involved like this. 
[02:32:30]  Woods vehemently denied a photo of a naked woman published recently by some Irish media outlets was his wife.  The picture first came out three years ago and Woods denied it then.  So he wasn't all that happy about doing it again.  I'm very disappointed in, I mean, not the fans, not the people here, not the Irish people, but very disappointed in how the article that was written. 
[02:33:00]  My wife, yes, she has been a model prior and she did do some bikini photos, but to link her to porn websites and the such is unacceptable.  One of the magazines involved issued a statement saying discussion of the photo was included in a regular satirical column and apologized to Woods and his wife for any offense.  Still, as one of the most visible athletes in the world, Tiger is used to a prying media, but this incident clearly struck a nerve. 
[02:33:30]  It's just that sometimes you just don't let the facts get in the way of a good story.  You know, that's sometimes what happens, and I think this was a clear incident of that.  My wife is an extension of me, and we're in it together.  We are a team, and we do things as a team, and I care about her with all my heart.  I thought Tiger handled that extremely well.  You know, he's, you know, he dealt with it. 
[02:34:00]  You know, he dealt with it first thing today and got out of the way so that we all move on.  I think the whole team understands his frustration.  Nobody likes that.  Woods didn't hint at any legal action, but his agent says he is deciding whether or not to pursue a lawsuit.  What is of more immediate concern to the Europeans, however, is whether Tiger and his teammates take out their anger on the golf course when the Ryder Cup tees off here on Friday. 
[02:34:30]  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel.  Tiger Woods is a bore.  That's as angry as he gets.  God almighty.  That's as mad as he gets.  It's just unacceptable.  When you have the emotion like I'm having right now, you're really seething, aren't you?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Who cares?  The whole world thinks his wife is a piece of ass.  Where did he get the pictures?  I got it from a Negro.  Well, you know what it is.  They're a team. 
[02:35:00]  He hits golf balls and makes millions, and she smiles and fucks him.  Go team.  You met Tiger Woods, and he was nothing but nice to you, Jimmy.  I like him, actually, but he's boring to be interviewed.  I liked him very much.  He was very sweet to me.  Yeah.  It's a non-story.  Who cares?  Your wife's a piece of ass.  This type of thing's going to happen, unfortunately.  It's in the hole!  At least he's got the forum to just, you know, call a press conference and say it's not true.  It's a bunch of bunk.  Right, exactly.  All those photos of my ex-girlfriend with a dick attached to her, I don't know how they 
[02:35:30]  photoshopped them.  Take that suit man bag out of here, Than, before I do something drastic, like kiss your neck.  That was good stuff.  Yeah.  All right, mancations.  What the hell is this about?  Oh, we were laughing about that in the office earlier.  What is...  It's just, this terminology and slang words for certain things in this country have gotten  ridiculous.  Can you fucking just man up? 
[02:36:00]  What's wrong with just vacation?  Hanging out with your friends?  Going charter fishing, perhaps?  Maybe going to Vegas with your buddies?  This is anything you would do without the girls.  Or like...  Go out with the guys.  Hilton Head.  What?  Some golf and some...  Ah, yeah.  Okay.  Some boobie bars, whatever.  Golf outings, things like that.  You take that.  They have to make a name for it that makes it sound like the gayest fucking thing you could 
[02:36:30]  possibly do.  A mancation.  Yeah, the headline is really gay.  Getaways with the guys or mancations are hot.  Are hot.  Mancations are hot.  Read the guy's name.  It's Gene...  Grab-a-dick.  No.  Grab-a-dick.  A what?  Grabber-nick.  Oh, grabber-nick.  Of the grabber-nicks.  I'm a grabber-nick.  He likes nicks.  Nick.  Gene Grabber-nick longs for a hotel with all the things a man would want on a getaway with 
[02:37:00]  friends.  Cock-ass.  I mean, what kind of...  It should be a hotel with just Aussie videos and meat pussies.  Mancations, where the concierge ushers guests to the hottest clubs, where requests from  hand-rolled cigars to favorite beers in the minibar are unflinchingly fulfilled, where  luxury is wrapped in sexy, swanky style.  Where all the girls are smiling with black eyes. 
[02:37:30]  So he built it.  The Regent South Beach, the hotel of Grabber-nick, developed here and plans to open in October  as among businesses nationwide, targeting guys vacationing, or as they like to say, mancationing  with their friends.  Mancation.  Who the fuck says that?  No one.  They're making up a word to try to make something more of this than it is.  They're offering everything from poker parties to hand-rolled cigars, buckets of beer to 
[02:38:00]  sports tickets, all in hopes of tapping a growing market.  What they failed to mention, because they don't want to blow up anyone's spot, is they're  probably offering hookers and dancers, or at least a trip to the strip clubs.  Or this would be just the gayest thing ever.  Yeah.  To hang out with your guys in this way.  Two men and a mancation.  We're leaving man-town to go on a mancation.  These trips are about a group of people that most likely met in college and are sort of 
[02:38:30]  just extending their yesterdays, said Josh Lesnick.  Josh Lesnick is a stepper.  President of I'm In, a Waltham Massachusetts-based business founded last year that helps organize  trips for groups of men.  Men.  We don't need women with their nasty pussies.  It's once a year or twice a year.  It's sort of a rite of passage.  It's sacred territory.  What the fuck?  No, it's not.  This is a rite of passage.  A bunch of jerk-off college friends laughing.  Remember that time you did that? 
[02:39:00]  Shut up.  I had the beers.  Give me a cigar.  Fucking assholes.  Stay home and eat your wife's ass.  You fucking creeps.  That's a mancation.  I hate mancations.  And they like the pussy, Anthony.  Do they?  Yes.  This guy is an entrepreneur and he knows what he's doing.  There's girls involved in these mancations. 
[02:39:30]  It's so easy to go after these guys.  Then fucking mention it.  It's so easy to just go after these guys and saying they're a bunch of guys that want to hang out with guys.  No, it's really good friends that have kept in touch over the years and they want to get, you know, leave their girlfriends or wives behind for a week's vacation and bang broads.  That's what this is all about.  Well, they could talk about the poker parties and the handmade cigars all they want.  But, of course, they're not going to mention the fact that they take them to strip clubs and maybe they play a round of golf where all the girls are caddies and they're all topless and all that. 
[02:40:00]  Well, they sure don't bring it up in this article.  Of course they're not.  They can't or they'll lose all their business.  Yeah, they could mention it a certain way.  Because as a man going on a mancation, you could show this to your wife and go, look, it's innocent fun.  It's me and my fraternity boys from 10 years ago.  You know, look what they do.  It's poker games.  It's cigars.  You know what I mean?  It's golf.  And look right here.  Graham and he said his concept for the regent, which would also feature girls who will suck your cock and lick your ball bag for money, was partially inspired with his own getaways with friends. 
[02:40:30]  I made that up.  That was wishful thinking on Jimmy Norton's part.  It's also potentially big business.  Research commissioned by I'm in found trips taken by friends, male and female alike, could annually generate $11 billion in online sales and reservations alone.  It should be on reservations alone.  Graham and Nick said his concept for the regent, which features a glass-bottom pool, Mercedes-Benz 500S house cars, and 24-hour concierge service, was partly inspired by his own getaways with friends. 
[02:41:00]  There were broads involved.  Yep.  They jet off to places like Aspen, Colorado and Costa Rica every few months with a clear idea of what makes a perfect getaway.  What, you and your fucking faggoty friends in a nice car with no chick to jam your hand up her skirt?  It sounds horrendous.  Hey, fan, you want to go to Costa Rica and sit in a tub in a Mercedes or go in the glass-bottom pool while Travis sips a fucking hot toddy? 
[02:41:30]  Just men.  At least Vegas hasn't figured out, you know, what happens if Vegas stays in Vegas.  Yes, they know.  They know when the girls get together and they go to Vegas or the guys get together and go to Vegas.  There's going to be some crazy shit going on.  They're not hiding under this concept.  They talk about this one guy, Bernthal, and a group of five or six other guys have traveled to Portugal, Spain, and Brazil.  All right.  And his father recently went to Chicago.  All right, wait a minute.  Brazil.  Fairmont's mancation package. 
[02:42:00]  All right, Brazil.  Jimmy's been there.  Yeah, yeah.  What happens in Brazil if you go with a bunch of guys?  You bring money and you fuck the indigenous women.  But you don't call it a mancation?  Did you go to Patrice O'Neal and say, hey, Patrice, let's go on a mancation.  Hold on a minute.  He did go on a mancation.  No, I didn't.  I went on a fact-finding mission for the United States.  I wanted to see how many loads I could pump out into a South American group of women.  But there was one vacation because you guys tried to get me to go.  Three times we went.  But there was a whole group of you guys.  Me, Patrice, Bobby Kelly, Jason Steinberg, Evan Steinberg. 
[02:42:30]  We all went, yeah.  Then call it semantics.  On one plane.  Because I would never do anything called a mancation.  I would seem to do a fancation.  Yes.  Where you just go out and you're sarcastic to everybody and no one really understands if you're serious or not.  This is a way of making it very, very innocent.  Would you like a room?  No.  This is a way to make it very, very innocent because the wives and the girlfriends are looking over your shoulder.  Look, honey, it's a mancation.  Look how innocent this is.  I'm going to sell samcations where you go away, no one knows what race you are, and you talk like a faggot. 
[02:43:00]  I want butler service.  Do you?  How about a vampcation where you just go around at night with our intern and suck blood?  What my friends and I like, he says, is what we're putting into this hotel.  You read this, right?  The region will offer a package targeting men with a penthouse room, a private rooftop terrace with a hot tub and wet bar, round-the-clock butler service, and a choice of a luxurious rental car such as a Porsche, Bentley, or Lamborghini. 
[02:43:30]  Hey, guys.  Why don't we just – I'm just going to bring this up because we're on our mancation.  Right.  And I normally wouldn't say this, but since we're on a mancation and we've got the hot tub here, it – now, don't take this the wrong way.  Let's just get naked and get in the hot tub.  We're on a mancation.  Come on, everybody.  Just don't – don't even think about it.  Don't give it too much thought.  You with me?  Come on.  Let's go. 
[02:44:00]  I'm alone in the hot tub.  I'd go with you.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Me and Jimmy are going on a mancation.  An urban dictionary definition, by the way, for mancation, describes it as men engaging in masculine activities such as sports, camping, gambling, chasing women, and drinking.  Without the presence of wives, mistresses, or girlfriends, Vince Vaughn, how did he, how popularized the term in the summer's romantic comedy, The Breakup. 
[02:44:30]  Dozens of – go ahead, Jimmy.  What fucking faggoty guys take their terminology from that shit movie?  Dozens of other places are getting into the mancation act, too, at the Wild Dunes Resort in Isle of Palm, South Carolina.  The Dudes on the Dunes package includes a round of golf, an in-room poker game with snacks and beer from $625 per person for two nights.  The Marquis Los Cabos Resort in Los Cabos, Mexico, includes surfing lessons, golf, poker, cigars, beer, chips, and guacamole. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  And it's man-themed package from $4.90 a night.  Do you have to jerk the cigars to get the guacamole out?  And the Harbor Beach Resort and Spa in Fort Lauderdale is offering the fishing package, I guess, which includes a fishing expedition and a chef to cook the catch of the day starting at $725 per person.  Did you see the Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston?  The Entourage package, it's tapping the popularity of the HBO series, chronicling the lives of a Hollywood actor. 
[02:45:30]  It starts at $3,000 for four people for two nights.  They promise to also give you a second season at the Fairmont Chicago in Illinois.  The mancation includes seminars on style.  Oh, just fucking awful.  Mancation.  You know what I thought of when I first heard mancation, though, is that stupid HBO real sex where all the men get together in the woods.  And they're naked and playing like a bongo drum and hugging each other and going, oh, oh, and groaning to get to feel better about themselves as men. 
[02:46:00]  Group hug, completely naked in the woods.  In the woods.  Humming as you, uh...  These men are learning to be men with each other and comfortable with their manliness.  One guy gets a little overzealous. 
[02:46:30]  People keep your hands off of my mule.  Oh!  Oh!  All right, well, we got people that went on mancation.  Stan and Vegas.  Mancation.  Stan, you went on a mancation? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, I sure did, and it's pretty nice.  You can kick back at the pool all day drinking, and, you know, all the guys are drinking beer, and I'm kicking back drinking a bikini-teeni.  Yeah.  Uh, let's go to Mark in New York.  Mark?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey there, Mac.  Uh, out of curiosity, did these faggots run trips to Brokeback Mountain, too?  All right. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  They're stacking up.  Jim and in line up.  Three up and three down.  Jim?  Yeah.  What's up?  Yeah, I think Jimmy got passed over for line of the day.  I'm on a fact-finding mission.  You guys didn't laugh that much.  A fact-finding mission for the United States to South America to see how many loads I can pump in there, indigenous women.  That was beautiful.  I think we laughed.  I got a nice laugh.  A hearty belly laugh.  We'll see what the line of the day is today.  Hey, guys.  Uh, 62 pounds on the Fast Match Diet.  Nice. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, congrats, man.  Gained or lost?  Lost.  All right.  Ryan in Wisconsin.  Ryan?  Hey, guys.  I'm, uh, I'm actually planning a mancation right now.  Are you?  Yeah, uh, November 30th through, uh, December 2nd at Zany's in Chicago.  Frunkus.  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Oh, sir, that's not a real mancation.  Chris?  Hey, hey.  By the way, it's not frunkus, you fucking no-tongue-rolling idiot.  Uh, I'll punch you out later.  Not you, dude.  Don't punch you out. 
[02:48:30]  By the way, Thad, who are these people outside?  Hi, guys.  Uh, I did not have a mancation.  Are any of you message board people?  Which one are you from?  Is that what they are?  What's your name on a whack bag?  They're message board people?  Is he good?  Why?  I don't know any of them besides their little names.  Nothing.  What's his name?  I don't know any message board people.  God bless you.  By looks.  God bless you.  Mostly just by, by names.  By wacky names based on things we've said on this program. 
[02:49:00]  Jimmy Tartill.  I'm sure Mancation's gonna be up there now.  What's his name?  Mancation.  He's right behind it.  I'm Don the Trucker.  Oh, really?  Oh, Don the Trucker.  Are you nice to me on a whack bag?  Of course.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  You're my hero.  I told you that at Camden.  Oh, you're a good man.  All right.  What's going on?  Nothing.  But I've always, like, we have people come up, and I've just noticed that, like, I've  never met a message board person who has bad-mouthed me, not for physical confrontation reasons, 
[02:49:30]  but just to see the guy face-to-face.  You just want to hope maybe one of the times that it'll be somebody that just comes up.  You don't understand how much I'm dying for it.  That is bad-mouthed you.  Dying for it.  Yeah.  Only because it's like, I don't know, well, you know the reasons.  I just hate the anonymity of it.  I just fucking hate the anonymity.  Guys that use your real names and faces are getting no problem with you, no matter how much you hate me.  All right.  CJ in Florida, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Angel.  What's up?  I'm a C in West Palm.  Anthony, it sounds to me more like a dicecation, maybe. 
[02:50:00]  Punch it out.  I think you're setting me up for a bit.  Yeah.  Is that what he was doing?  Well, you don't know how to do it.  You need listeners to set you up.  You know, so that's what they do.  Thanks for being a part of the program, so your producer credits are on their way.  Dicecation, and go.  Oh, it'd be fun.  Hey, good.  All right, we'll move on.  Thanks, listeners, for fucking spoiling it.  We got a building owner makes an angry phone call to an elevator company customer.  Service guy.  Building owner, elevator company customer. 
[02:50:30]  Service guy.  Guy.  Okay.  Thanks for holding.  This is Mike.  We just scrubbed the elevator.  Mike, listen, just give me the fucking elevator fix that slut that was on the phone earlier.  Go Unica, New York now.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Why the beep?  That's his name or something?  That's a name, probably.  Okay, we're not peeping curses?  No.  I hope not, because someone did a piss-poor job at the beginning.  I just want to make sure they'll skin us alive over here at XM. 
[02:51:00]  Go Unica, New York now.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I'm so fucking sick of this piece of shit I have to deal with with you people.  It's the worst elevator in the world.  I'm going to throw it out and come and ram it up your fucking noses.  Get them here now.  What's the address?  What the fuck?  What the fuck am I stupid 16 to New York?  Okay, we got you.  Utica Historic Erie Canal?  Yeah, right here.  I think you got that money for this fucking hell.  Fucking just fix it. 
[02:51:30]  16.  Yeah, right now I got to get it fixed.  Okay, what is your first and last name?  My name is Dave and I'm the owner.  And guys, they come there and punch us all in the fucking face.  I have this fucking shit you sell me.  Okay, what is your...  It's every fucking day.  What is your phone number with the area code first?  Oh, 266 area code.  Where the fuck are you?  We're in Dallas.  Dallas, go stick it up your ass, you fucking assholes.  We're the worst company in the world. 
[02:52:00]  If the motherfuckers aren't here in five fucking minutes,  I'm going to punch the guy in the face when he comes here.  Okay, so that's three...  Which elevator?  Only one?  What?  Which elevator?  The only fucking one in the building, you dumb fuck.  Okay, it's not working.  Is there anybody inside it?  Yeah.  Okay, there's somebody stuck inside it?  In the elevator.  There's a passenger inside there?  Yeah, no, there's a fucking martian in there. 
[02:52:30]  You fuck.  Is the passenger okay?  This is New York City.  This is New York.  You know, you motherfuckers think I'm a dumb dog.  That cocksucker better be here now.  Now.  Is there somebody stuck in your elevator?  I'm so fucking mad.  It's the worst piece of equipment.  You ought to fucking...  You ought to take a gun and you ought to blow your brains out  for manufacturing this piece of shit that you manufactured.  Is there somebody stuck in the elevator?  Did I...  What am I, stupid? 
[02:53:00]  Did you not hear me?  You imbecile.  Get the fucking guy here now.  So there is somebody in the elevator?  Do you understand?  Yes or no, is there somebody in the elevator?  No, there's a martian in the elevator.  He climbed through a roof.  What floor is the passenger stuck on?  There's two floors.  Are you people that ignorant?  Do not know what fucking elevators are in what building.  Do you not know it?  I don't know what floors, sir.  There's only two fucking floors.  There's a 50-50 fucking chance.  You take a guess.  Okay, let me advise you if you're asking to call 911. 
[02:53:30]  We'll call 911.  We'll call 911.  We'll call 911.  We'll call 911.  Somebody out there.  Okay, thank you.  That is a great call.  It's a 50-50 chance.  How great was that guy?  You figure it out.  That's a great call right there.  Fucking martians.  The martians.  How long ago was that call?  We don't know.  We have the real number, though.  He was angry.  That is a great call.  Why don't we get in touch with him and find out whatever happened with his elevator?  Let's go to Greg in Jersey.  Get it fixed, you fucking asshole.  Greg, what's up?  Hey there, Greg.  Hey, what's up? 
[02:54:00]  I'm just saying that that guy sounded very angy.  He didn't sound angry.  He sounded angy.  Yeah, everyone's pointing out that the pad data said angy phone call.  Angy phone call?  Angy phone call.  You suck.  Did he leave?  Did that e-tart leave a fucking R out of angry?  Yeah.  Angy.  He fixed it, so we can't abuse him too much now.  The fact that he had to fix it.  Yeah, for most of the call, it's an angy phone call.  Deck is an idiot.  Tim in Edmonton.  Tim.  Angy.  Hey there, Tim. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  He's pretty much saying the same thing.  Jenna wants in on the Fatty Pig Fatty contest.  Jenna.  Uh-oh.  What happened to the...  Did we leave it on the machine over there?  Hey, Jenna.  Oh.  Do we have the promo?  No.  Could you play the Fatty Pig Fatty promo?  I didn't...  We didn't answer.  Oh, I thought you clicked.  It's so odd what I see over here.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  It's the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty contest. 
[02:55:00]  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  The Opie and Anthony Show is looking for fat, blubbery, undisciplined women to point and  laugh at.  Don't worry.  We're willing to pay for the privilege.  Just haul your big, embarrassing ass down to our free FM studio in New York City, strap  a pig mask around your fat skull, squeeze your hindquarters into a bikini, and have a  snack for 15.  The biggest mess to waddle through the door at the end of the contest wins 10 bucks for  every humiliating pound on her carcass.  So if you're saddled with 350 pounds of embarrassing flab, you get $3,500. 
[02:55:30]  Try those tears, young lady.  Three grand buys a lot of Kleenex.  And a lot of pizza.  Brought to you by your compassionate friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Pizza.  And a lot of pizza.  Steve's a fucking asshole.  Coffee and pizza.  And August.  Pizza diva.  Well, Jenna wants in.  Jenna?  Hi.  Jenna's from Cleveland.  We'll be broadcasting live from...  What is it?  K-Rock?  K-Rock.  Yeah, it's K-Rock. 
[02:56:00]  I just said K-Rock without knowing.  I just agreed with him.  Like, yeah, K-Rock.  Yeah.  I didn't know what I was talking about.  Yeah.  What's wrong with me?  Well, because they changed most of the stations to free FM, so...  They switched it around.  Used to be K-Rock was New York.  Instead of saying, I don't know, when he asked, is it K-Rock, I just went, yeah, it is.  All right, we'll be broadcasting live from K-Rock tomorrow morning, and then they replay  the show.  Well, they'll play the show for the first time in afternoon drive, so it's a little confusing  for everybody tomorrow, so we hope you show up at the station.  Are people listening to us in Cleveland?  I think they are.  Supposedly.  I was talking to the PD last night.  The buzz is really good in Cleveland, so... 
[02:56:30]  We'll be at the station from 6 a.m. to about 11 a.m. tomorrow.  Jenna?  Yeah?  You want in on the contest?  I'm thinking so.  My husband's, like, against it, because he knows how I am.  How are you?  How are you?  Yes.  Well, no, he knows, like, if I go in there and people start ripping on me, he's going to  have to bail me out of jail.  No, we'll be okay.  Oh, wait, why?  Would you start swinging?  Do you ever have a problem at a China shop?  We're all excited to just let the lines fly.  Fight, bitch. 
[02:57:00]  Fight.  Yeah, no.  That's right.  Yeah, you'd start swinging?  I would.  I've done it before.  I'll try it.  Did you ever get thrown out of a China shop?  No.  Yeah, that could happen sometimes.  No.  You know what?  I had a guy tell me, I'm way heavier now than what I used to be, and when I was losing  weight before, I was on this, like, boot camp program, and the guy that was helping me  Boring.  I know, but just touch.  For as big as I am, I move like a fucking Giselle. 
[02:57:30]  I'm very flexible.  A Giselle?  Wait, I didn't hear you speak about your phone crapped out.  You move like a what?  A Giselle.  Oh.  Very graceful.  So, no, I've never been given a time.  Very graceful.  No, that's good to hear.  Good job.  Seriously, yeah.  A Giselle.  No, you seem like you're a jet egg.  So, now, are you going to jet on the scale for us?  Yeah.  See, she's jarjantuan.  Oh, my God.  What? 
[02:58:00]  You know, it's gazelle.  You pronounce the soft G as a hard G.  Yeah.  I thought it was soft.  No, no, no.  No.  All those years.  I'm the ignorant bitch.  No, no, no.  You just mispronounce anything.  Sunt.  And, you know, you would think you would know by grabbing so many by the throat and  disemboweling them on the plains of the Serengeti.  No.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  How big a gal are you?  Well, I haven't stepped on a scale in a while. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  But when I last was on a scale when I was pregnant with my son 18 months ago, I think I was like  270, 280.  That's not that.  I mean, that's a big girl, but that's not that bad.  Yeah, you've got to be 220.  I'm 5'9".  And when people find out how much I weigh, they're like, no fucking way.  Well, you've got to be 220.  Oh, God.  Forget it.  I'm a fat bitch.  Shut the fuck up.  No, you're not that bad.  God damn.  Will you shut up for one second so we can get in and talk to you?  Yeah.  Go ahead. 
[02:59:00]  And?  What?  I shut up for five seconds so you can talk to me.  Eat one of the snacks that is in front of you so we can talk for a minute.  See?  Big misconception.  I'm not a big eater.  Oh, really?  You're not a big eater?  Not at all.  What is it?  Your metabolism?  Yeah.  Actually, I was just diagnosed.  What do you put?  What do you put?  Mayo on your metabolism?  No, that's just nasty.  You have a very slow metabolism.  I do.  Extremely.  So you want to stop by tomorrow?  Yeah, but you know what? 
[02:59:30]  Can you guys make me just a little promise?  What?  What?  That you'll have me out of there by like 7 a.m. if I'm in at 6?  Absolutely.  Yeah, that's easy.  We won't have you wait.  Seriously, because...  Trust me, if you're hot and at the right weight, it would be tough to get you out of there at 7.  Fat messes, no problem.  Yeah, you're in and out.  What if someone you need for the shade when the sun comes up?  Yeah, I have to hide from...  No, my husband has to go to work at 8 and he'll be watching.  Yeah, no problem.  We'll let you go through the easy pass toll of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:00:00]  You'll be fine.  We'll have you out soon.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  We promise.  Yeah, trust me.  Love you.  Get on the scale.  Get the fuck out.  Thank you.  I don't even know where it's...  I don't even know where it's...  Are they at the Halley building?  Please hold.  We will tell you.  Please hold.  Someone will tell you.  Give the lovely Jenna some info so she can stop by.  The weight to beat at this point is 227 pounds.  227.  Uh...  I forgot her name already.  Jenna.  No, the one that's from this morning.  Sarah?  Sarah.  That's right, from Queens.  And we had fucking Big Rhonda coming in.  Her pictures aren't up yet on opiananthony.com in the video of her putting on the pig mask. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, come on.  Get to it.  Snap to it.  Yeah, we need something to look at here.  When's Big Rhonda coming in?  Uh, Monday now.  Okay.  That's fine.  I think that's fine, though.  At least we won't be waiting.  We have to leave early anyway, because of the fucking plane ride.  All right.  There's something weird going on in Jacksonville, Florida.  We have nothing to do with this.  They thought they'd be cute.  Jacksonville Station is stunting before launching a new format, and the music at the end has people  thinking the ONA show is coming there. 
[03:01:00]  What?  This has happened over the years.  Like, when stations change formats, they'll play, like, a little clip of our show or something?  Your show we're not?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, okay.  And then people think we're coming to that station, and then they change into some, like,  I don't know, disco station.  Great.  So, E-Rock brought this to our attention.  I haven't heard it yet.  We have to launch 106.5 FM on Thursday.  Jack, clear the cloud.  What about you?  Dude, I am so up for this, bro. 
[03:01:30]  Like, we could totally have a radio station that I would so listen to, that plays whatever  we want.  Who's we?  I don't get it.  No.  Whatever we want.  You mean whatever I want?  It's like we play a little bit of this.  Oh, Street Fighter Man.  Oh, Street Fighter Man.  And then next, some of this.  I'm on my second train.  But I've had a few before. 
[03:02:00]  Because that's what we want.  They're teasing an iPod station.  Another iPod station.  At least they talk with their real voices.  This is the Jack format.  It's awful.  Who cares?  That's what we want.  We scares me a little bit.  I don't get it.  And here's the best part, bro.  We name the station after me.  Ha ha ha.  Right.  Sure.  Like somebody would name their station Jack.  What, bro?  Jack would totally work. 
[03:02:30]  Better than calling it Bill.  Okay, everybody.  That's it.  They pay me to bring it all together.  It's time for you to step up and make the decision.  No more of this.  I got a tea time to get to.  We launched this baby on Thursday.  106.5 FM has to be ready to go on Thursday.  You figure it out.  You make it happen.  This is the entertainment business.  What do you think the 106.5? 
[03:03:00]  Very soon, here in Jacksonville.  Soon.  You know what that is.  The production guy is probably a fan of our show.  He's heard that music bed and said this would work in the promo.  Absolutely.  That's all it is.  That's all it is.  Who's the paranoid lunatic that thought that had anything  to do with us?  Where's Eric?  We're not the only ones using that bed.  What?  We've actually gotten a few emails about Jacksonville.  Right.  We should know better.  Where's Eric?  A few emails saying what? 
[03:03:30]  Asking what was going on.  You know, Rivera uses innocent, man, to come out onto the mound.  You can't have another team that has a pitcher that comes out to the same music.  Did you guys really think that this has something to do with us, though?  Look at all the shaking heads.  Even from a tea standpoint?  Really?  No.  Be honest.  Iraq.  You thought this had something to do with us?  Iraq?  As far as using us anyway?  That was the first time I heard it.  Oh, boy.  Who brought this to us?  I did.  Steve brought this to our attention.  Some listeners sent that to me saying, are you guys going on to Jacksonville? 
[03:04:00]  Because this is airing on a Jacksonville station.  And I think one of the people from one of our affiliates emailed me the other day.  We don't own the Rage Against the Machine music bed.  They're just using the bed.  They're not going on in Jacksonville.  Ever.  Nice diversion there, Steve, to a listener.  I like that.  They obviously did a good job of knocking that one.  You sidestepped it.  Blame it on a listener.  Are you coming to Cleveland?  No.  Yeah.  If you got me, then you didn't.  All right.  They're going to do, it looks like maybe a Spanish thing.  Spanish Jack or something.  Yeah, I heard some Spanish after that. 
[03:04:30]  Some Spanish language.  I fucking hate Jack.  Why?  Jack is great.  I don't like the name of it.  It's a great format.  Listen to Jack, dude.  It's a great.  Shut the fuck up.  Why?  It's a fantastic format.  It stinks.  I'm with Jimmy.  Wait, is it?  It really stinks.  What company has it?  Say it privately.  It stinks.  No, no.  I mean.  A little company called CPS.  Oh, well, you know what the problem with Jack is?  Yeah.  There's not enough of them.  Right.  All right. 
[03:05:00]  We'll take a break.  When we get back, we got Lazy Legs.  Oh, no.  Lazy Legs.  Oh, Christopher Reeve.  We're going to hear about Lazy Legs.  Can I update my references?  He's dead.  Anthony in Florida.  Yes.  What's up?  How you doing?  Better now, sweetie.  Hey, hey, Anthony.  It's Prince Spaghetti Day.  That's right.  What do you got?  Shut up.  Yeah.  I want to make a $1,000 donation on behalf of the attorney I work for, for your fatty pig 
[03:05:30]  fatty, I guess.  Can we just take this guy's money or what?  Yes.  Where are you?  Yes.  We're completely within our means to take anyone's money.  I'm in Palm Beach, Florida.  Okay.  Please send a certified bank check.  Yeah, no kidding.  Are we going to set up a PayPal account?  That's the easiest way.  Yeah.  Yeah, set up PayPal.  All right, Anthony.  I don't know.  Hold on a line, okay?  I think.  Yeah.  The more money we get from the O&A pass.  Fatter the bitches will be.  The bigger messes we will bring. 
[03:06:00]  That's what we need.  $10 a pound is nice, but if we get that figure up to $20, $25 a pound, now we're talking.  Slobs.  Now the girls will start traveling from all over the country to be in on the contest.  All right.  Lazy Legs.  Next.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh.  It's in my shoes.  Ramon, clean this up.  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine. 
[03:06:30]  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine.  It's a big machine.  Ah.  I'll drive up to a big machine.  My heart has got my mind.  My heart has got my mind.  Who is this?  I got kids coming.  It must be good.  You're taking Advil.  Listening to it.  It's sick all morning.  Velvet revolver.  Nice.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to get out of here a little early because we've got a plane to catch. 
[03:07:00]  I hope we don't have to actually catch it because I'm too tired.  I cannot run 160 miles per hour.  Yeah, we've got to leave our...  We'll try to catch it.  Yes.  All right.  We've got Lazy Legs first.  We're doing Lazy Legs?  I want to do Homo Governor.  Do you really?  How could we not play?  All right.  Did McGreevy on Oprah air already?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, it did?  Okay.  Yeah, it aired.  So we talked about it, but I want to hear it because from what I hear, he talks about  his little truck stop or rest stop exploits, sex exploits.  He's doing the rest areas.  He's doing the rest areas.  The alleyways.  He's the fucking governor of New Jersey at the time.  He was having sex while his wife was having a C-section.  Married.  Yeah.  This guy is a good egg.  Married.  Yeah.  His wife is having a kid and he is just out. 
[03:08:00]  He cannot get gay enough.  The guy was trying to play hetero for so long that once that gay slipped out, he went so  gay.  He said, plug it.  He's going to, you know, he could have probably kept it on the QTs, the governor, you know?  Yeah, you could keep it quiet in the governor's mansion or something like that, but he's just,  I gotta, I gotta be gay.  How do you keep it quiet in the government's mansion? 
[03:08:30]  People around everywhere.  I think you could probably, let's see, say you're going out for the night.  God bless you, sweetie.  Pick up your lover and bring him back as some type of business associate and you need to  do some work privately in the governor's office.  Then you eat his ass on your desk.  Right.  Right on the blotter.  Then you spread his dirty oniony cheeks and you bury your gubernatorial face in him. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  You explained that.  There it is.  I need some, uh, all the ends of the pens on his desk smell like shit.  Because he'd choose him after he's an asshole.  Well, here he is on Oprah.  Oprah.  Just admitting to pretty much everything.  Yeah.  When I grew up, being gay was something that was shameful, something that was an abomination,  something that was ridiculed.  Who the heck is running towards that?  Yeah.  I understand. 
[03:09:30]  Every sensible person says, and you believe.  Why, why, why?  He said, who is running towards that?  I said, you were ass first.  Oh, God damn.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  Oh.  All right.  We're not going to get an electric cure.  That's good.  Fucking McGrady.  Pouring water over everything. 
[03:10:00]  Every sensible person says, and you believe with everything you can.  Okay, so this is the question.  When you married Carrie, your first wife, did you think then, I'm no longer gay?  I thought, and let me just back up.  Okay.  You don't get to a cock.  It's the only way you like to get around, isn't it, Governor?  Back up.  Fucking brake lights in every car you ever have are worn out.  I thought, and let me just back up. 
[03:10:30]  Okay.  You don't necessarily say that you're gay.  I can say now I am gay, and I accept it, and I say it proudly.  And to me, it's no difference in having brown eyes or blue eyes being gay.  It's kind of like having brown eyes, is it?  Two in your head, one on your cock, and one settling on your mouth.  Sort of like having brown eyes. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, he's setting himself up.  Oh, my God.  That's an asshole, sir, and not a pinky ring.  By the way, got to interrupt all the fun.  The first contestant in Fatty Pig Fatty.  Yes.  The pictures are up on opiananthony.com.  It's good.  There she is.  Pig mask?  Pig mask.  Yeah.  Got to have the pig mask.  The official weight on the scale, which in this case is 227 pounds.  And then, yeah, a full-length shot of her in a pig mask.  That's the money shot. 
[03:11:30]  That is a perfect contestant.  So, for all you ladies out there, you've got to beat 227 pounds.  2,270 bucks right there.  That's right.  For her, if no one comes forward, that's a fatter.  We'll be weighing girls in Cleveland tomorrow when we do our show in the morning.  All right.  Come on, Cleveland fatties.  Gay.  And I accept it.  And I say it proudly.  And for me, it's no difference of having brown eyes or blue eyes.  Being gay is a grace, is a blessing from God, and it is who I am.  What?  But back then, I thought being gay was something I was fighting. 
[03:12:00]  It's a blessing from God.  God, you might want to read the Bible.  He swung the other way, didn't he?  You might want to read a few chapters in the Bible.  God said that you should be smitten, not with another man, but killed.  That's pretty much how the Bible sees it.  Not much tolerance going on there as far as God's concerned with homosexuality.  No.  Wow.  Let's say hi to CJ in Georgia.  CJ.  Hey.  Hey.  I just want to say that the governor tied himself in the line of the day with that brown eye 
[03:12:30]  comment, and I just want to back up.  I want to back up into a brown eye.  That was great.  Oh, wait a minute.  How could you do that?  Yeah.  It's matter and antimatter.  If two assholes meet at that speed.  Can't plug in the wrong ends of two extension cords.  Damn it.  I'm an idiot.  Why doesn't have a log coming out for them to lock?  Let's go to Tommy in New York.  Tommy.  Hey, hands down, Norton wins line of the day.  Bury your gubernatorial face in it.  Gubernatorial face.  That was a good one.  Let's go to Sarge from Whack Bag. 
[03:13:00]  Sarge.  That is a good one.  I can picture Freddie Mercury going, mustache right, gouverneur.  All right.  Back to the audio.  Yeah.  Good one.  All right.  Here's the second clip from Oprah.  But you speak of going, when you were in Washington, going behind the synagogue in the alley  with other men.  And so, if you were doing that, were you ashamed of yourself in doing it?  I remember you saying that when you went back there for the first time, you felt like you  were... 
[03:13:30]  I found people like me.  You felt like you were okay.  I found people like me.  Yeah.  Now, the situation for me was unhealthy.  It was bad.  But I saw people that from all backgrounds, all job skills...  This is what I could understand as you were describing this place behind the synagogue  in Washington, an alley.  Was that...  It wasn't covered.  No.  It was open.  So, you're just in an alley having sex.  And having trist.  Yeah.  Trist.  We'll be right back.  Having trist.  His voice is creeping me out. 
[03:14:00]  Having trist.  He's getting more of an effeminate sound to his voice.  Yeah.  He doesn't have to fake it anymore.  He's a buckle old Bill.  Everyone knows.  The wife's gone.  So, I gotta fuck it.  You look like you need a little help there, Big Daddy.  He's having trist.  With that big cock.  Chris in Ohio.  Chris.  Norton.  I want to give you some props on a line that I didn't think got nearly as many laughs  as it should have.  I probably agree.  The whole...  That's an asshole, sir.  Not a pinky ring.  I gotta nominate that for a line of the day, too. 
[03:14:30]  That is funny.  Thank you, sir.  That was a homosexual reference to a man fingering the ass of another gentleman.  Jay in Boston.  Hey, I just wanted to call out Jimmy.  He says the governor likes to back up.  The brake lights are worn out on every car he ever had.  Oh, God damn it.  I meant to say...  Yeah, I'm alright.  Oh, sir, we all have little verbal tics.  Alright, here we go.  More from Oprah.  By trist, by the way.  I guess if she said you're having sex back there, he says, well, trist. 
[03:15:00]  I guess he means oral.  Like he doesn't want to commit to say that they were having sex back.  He didn't say trist.  What did he say?  Trist?  Trist.  No, trist.  I don't know what the word is for blowjobs with other men in a fucking alley.  No, that's fun.  A trist.  A trist is not a gender thing.  A trist is like...  I know.  It's like a little thing.  A little rendezvous.  Is it never pronounced trist?  Yes, by dummies.  And by...  Like, it depends on what you define a trist as. 
[03:15:30]  I think you were making fun of me.  Oh, cut it out.  You have a hand wipe.  I was...  To me, like, when I meet a girl...  Oh, the Noctis thing over on the...  Anthony Noctis club soda were all over the, uh...  That's all right.  Guys, me and my friends would get together and have, uh...  And we would take fucking moist towelette mancations.  We'd all go to places and wipe our hands with moist towelettes.  That's what I'm doing right now.  That's not a mancation in an alley.  Here's more audio from Oprah.  Yeah.  I think it's being authentically... 
[03:16:00]  I think it's authentically challenging every day, even if you haven't lived.  Because you've got to be open to feelings.  You've got to be open to love.  You've got to be open to suffering.  You've got to be open to trying to do God's will.  Not your own will.  You're open to animus.  You don't shit all over your new friend.  You were hiding this lie about yourself.  Yes.  Did you think you were doing God's will?  I thought I was trying to be the best little boy.  Yes, I thought I was trying to do what was right.  He's been told that before.  Yeah.  Big cock burying him.  You're the best little boy.  I've been told that by being patted on the back of the head. 
[03:16:30]  You best little boy.  You best little boy.  Let's go to Ryan in Pennsylvania, Ryan.  Two men fucking shishkebobbing him, agreeing with each other that old Jimbo is the best  little boy.  Old Governor Jimmikins.  Going over state policy on his back.  Like Caligula when he's stamping on...  And they're the people of the rope.  They're the people of the rope.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, man.  New contest starring McGreevy.  Faggy, pig, faggy.  Oh, wow. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  It's cracking him up.  I'm glad.  I kill me.  He's trying to help the joke along.  Yeah, please.  Let's say hi to Ron Burgundy.  Hey, guys.  Did this guy always...  I don't know the New Jersey governor from anywhere, but did he always have the gay accent?  Or is that something...  Not like that.  He sounds deaf, dude.  He sounds deaf.  Yeah.  Was he always deaf?  Did he always sound...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sounds like he's got the hearing fucked out of him.  Somebody came to his fucking eardrums in with a cock. 
[03:17:30]  But where does his accents come from?  I don't get it.  It's hanging out with a lot of gay people, I think.  It's giving him more of an effeminate...  I think he always...  In his voice.  I think he always talked like that, but he was so paranoid he tried to talk...  Fix it.  ...man his voice up a little bit.  You can let it go on a mancation, boys.  Thanks, gents.  Watch out.  All right.  Gents?  Gents have a little cane and top hat?  Yeah.  We're gents here. 
[03:18:00]  Uh, Flip.  I believe the governor lives in the governor's mansion, not the government's mansion.  Yeah, I know.  I'm a little under the weather, and I'm on some fucking cold medicine.  Give me a fucking break today.  Give him a break, would you, sir?  And I also lost my fucking place that I worked to get for fucking six months.  And he's worth millions.  Flip.  Punching out.  Punching out.  I'm having a tough day.  Here's more audio.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  Ugh. 
[03:18:30]  Did you ever fall face first into a dumpster?  Did you ever rub your genitals in sewage?  Well, let me set up the clip here, Jamie.  Ready?  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  Eating aborted fetuses out of a dirty dead dog's asshole.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  I wonder if I... 
[03:19:00]  I got one.  Okay.  If you will.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  Boring.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  I wonder if anybody in our production crew has any answers for that question.  I'm only curious because it seems like an interesting question. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Asked the governor.  I got one before you got that.  All right.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  All right.  I think, yeah, somebody might.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  Maybe something else.  Oops.  And so your wife is in the...  What the hell happened there?  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hold on.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Let's see. 
[03:20:30]  That might be somebody from this very show again that might have a comment.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  No, nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  Get the fuck out now.  When she said, I don't have a cock, he said...  How'd your parents die?  Why would he say that?  That would be silly.  Why not?  I don't have a cock. 
[03:21:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Get the fuck out now.  Sorry.  When you screw up...  I'm obsessed with Steve.  He's all I think of.  The minute I leave here till the minute I get back, it's him.  What I wanted to know, when you made love to your wife, what was that like?  Just do it!  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  Oh, dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man. 
[03:21:30]  This ain't happening.  Well, that's great.  This is fucking great, man.  Now, what the fuck are we supposed to do?  We're some real pretty shit now, man.  Have you ever seen a grown man naked?  Let's see.  Oh, God.  You're gonna be okay.  Why, why?  We're looking for a winner here.  This is what I wanted to know. 
[03:22:00]  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  You can act like a man!  What's the matter?  Oh, exactly!  Uh, all right.  All right.  We're cakes for nothing!  Here's the clip.  This is what I wanted to know.  When you made love to your wife, what was that like?  It was special.  It was?  Yeah.  This, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Long pause. 
[03:22:30]  It was the special.  Yeah.  But he means in a way, like, retarded.  Yeah, like, horrible.  Let's get a...  Special.  Let's go to My Jacket.  My Jacket.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Just wanted to say, you know, maybe you think, you know, like, in his little state office there,  his little intern comes in to have a state bill signed.  He's gonna sign the bill.  I'll just sign on the dotted line here.  Let me grab a panel.  Cam's front.  I'm like, oh, I gotta suck your cock.  This perv switch just went off. 
[03:23:00]  You think his, uh, gay perv switch just went off in his head and he had it.  Going old school.  I like that, My Jacket.  He's a cock.  Pledge it out, guys.  Yeah.  I like that.  This bill will help the state of New Jersey in getting money from the federal government  at a rate...  I need to put this in my ass.  Did I say that?  The perv switch.  Here's Jim telling another cute story. 
[03:23:30]  He's got lots of stories.  I think Governor McGreevy, because I'm Jim.  Oh.  So, your wife is in the hospital.  Listen to this one.  With a terrible, difficult C-section.  Awful C-section.  And the pregnancy had been very difficult.  I bet.  You had a fucker.  And tell me what happened.  The conception was awful, too.  Did it come over?  Wasn't it, Jimbo?  I had to jerk off in a cup and dump it in before the temperature chilled.  He had to jerk off into a funnel. 
[03:24:00]  He had to put, like, a fake man-ass over a funnel and fuck it while it was on top of  her vagina.  Very difficult.  And tell me what happened.  You called him up and said, come over?  Golan was calling me repeatedly for a job.  By this time, I had been elected governor.  Golan's calling and calling and calling.  And he wants to get together.  And so I say, come over one night.  He wants to get together and do what, did you think?  I think talking about a job. 
[03:24:30]  Talking about a job.  Tell me.  Of the blow variety.  Come on.  Talking about a job.  I bet.  Talking about a job.  Tell me.  Would you read on page 228?  It's in the book.  So it's not like you hadn't said it to somebody.  Oprah's not brave enough to read it.  Yeah.  Making him read it.  In his own words.  It was the wrong thing to do.  I wasn't an ordinary citizen anymore.  State troopers parked outside. 
[03:25:00]  My wife was recovering from a difficult pregnancy and a C-section in the hospital.  And he was my employee.  But I took Golan by the hand and led him upstairs to my bed.  We undressed and he kissed me.  It was the first time in my life that a kiss meant what it was supposed to mean.  We're both damned forever.  It was like a man emerging from 44 years in a cave to taste pure air for the first time.  Pure air.  That is the last thing that he's...  I think you reversed it. 
[03:25:30]  It was like a man who had been breathing pure air for 44 years just nosedove into a cave.  You reversing things, goose.  Are you a little maggot?  You make me want to vomit.  We got some audio actually up in the room there.  Do you want to kiss me or...  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot. 
[03:26:00]  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  It's the last time I'm going to ask you.  Do you ever suck a guy's cock?  Caves to taste pure air for the first time.  Feel direct sunlight on the pallet skin.  Warmth where there had only ever been a bone-chilling numbness. 
[03:26:30]  I pulled him to the bed and we made love like I always dreamed.  A boastful, passionate, whispering, masculine kind of love.  Ew!  Can you pause that please?  A boastful whispering.  That's what he'd always dreamed of?  Fucking some Israeli incompetent?  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Guy sucked at his job.  I always wanted to fuck a Jew who wasn't qualified.  Cheers in the cave to taste pure air for the first time. 
[03:27:00]  Feel direct sunlight on the pallet skin.  Warmth where there had only ever been a bone-chilling numbness.  I pulled him to the bed and we made love like I always dreamed.  A boastful, passionate, whispering, masculine kind of love.  Oh, mother fucker!  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  One more clip.  That's a bit harsh.  They discuss Jim's past of anonymous gay sex. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, no.  I mean, Governor McGreevey.  Governor McGreevey.  Oh, no.  From the state of New Jersey.  Secretly, former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey says he carried on sexually with scores of  men in seedy bookstores, city parks, and highway rest stops.  There was no gay bar that I could go to without being discovered.  So the only place that I could discover who I was was sadly in places of anonymity or places  in dark shadows, where I could begin to experiment sexually. 
[03:28:00]  And so my sex was condemned to hellish places.  I can't imagine.  I really just can't even imagine what it would be like to live this lie your whole life and  always wondering, wouldn't you be wondering about those guys you met in the back alley  and in the bookstores?  Wouldn't you be wondering about those guys coming forward?  Yeah.  And you're filled with fear.  And you were saying you were tormented.  I was tormented.  Can you ask a question?  That's not where you find love in the back of a booth. 
[03:28:30]  That's where you fulfill your physical needs.  That's where you make buddies.  That's not being godly.  That's not finding love.  That's not being godly.  What a creep.  Being godly?  What's he doing?  He's talking about being discovered.  It's like, as the governor, what do you think is going to happen if somebody sees you  strolling out of a fucking bookstore at two in the morning?  Yeah.  What a creep.  Yeah.  He got married through all this, right?  Yeah.  I don't know if he got married.  He wasn't married.  Well, he was married.  But I mean, was he doing this before he got married?  I don't know.  During the marriage, obviously.  What a creep. 
[03:29:00]  Wow.  That is something.  Back alleys and rest areas.  Wherever there were cocks, there was me.  McGreevy was there.  Coming home, having to explain why his inner thighs are all chafed.  It's red from whiskers.  Changed his last name to McGreedy.  He just couldn't get enough cock.  Jesus.  Jim McGreeky.  His little reading there was... 
[03:29:30]  All right.  I have to go.  I got to go home.  Well, we got to do lines of the day really fast.  Okay.  And then I got to go do my...  Then we'll do our thing.  What thing?  Fucking flight.  We'll go into the bathroom.  Do our thing.  No, I forgot my drill.  We're going to make a hole, remember?  All right.  Here's the deal.  Tomorrow, we're broadcasting live from Cleveland.  Hopefully, a lot of people will show up.  Yep.  We'll have some O&A Traveling Virus tickets for you guys. 
[03:30:00]  Well, look who has arrived.  Looking for fat girls to show up at K-Rock in Cleveland tomorrow morning from 6 to 11 a.m.  Oh, we got one of those Tickle...  You found one of the Ultra Tickle Me Elmo TX whatever TMXs.  That's going to be the hot gift this Christmas.  That's the biggie.  That's the one everyone's going to get rich off of.  Everyone says that every year.  I was buying Furbies, were you? 
[03:30:30]  I bought 10,000 of them and couldn't sell one on eBay.  We should torture this one and throw it off on YouTube.  I agree.  I want to take a dump on it.  You want to do that for YouTube?  Why not?  A montage of...  It smells like it in here.  A montage of things we could do to this thing.  This exit.  Yeah, we got to think of some really cool things we could do with it.  We should run it over or something.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  I think we should all have a little chance to do something with it. 
[03:31:00]  Like, does everybody have a video camera or the availability of one?  No.  Like, take it with you and videotape you doing something to it.  And then bring the videotape back and then next day someone else can take it.  You can't, like, take a dump on it unless you're last up.  Because I would love to take it down to the range and fire a 12-gauge into its head.  And videotape that.  Or maybe just unload the AR into it.  Dude, why don't you just do that?  Why don't you just shoot the shit out of it? 
[03:31:30]  You get a good video of that.  We can throw that up on YouTube.  Yeah.  We'll upset a lot of people.  I might have to just shoot the living shit out of that thing.  Because you have to show it giggling in life first.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll get a few shots of it really, just how it works.  And then out on the range, moving around a little bit and giggling.  And right when it stands up, because at the end of its little thing that it does, it giggles.  He falls over backwards.  He, like, hits the floor a little, like, he's laughing so hard.  And then he sits up, kind of goes on his hands and feet, and then stands straight up. 
[03:32:00]  Boom!  Right then and there, his fucking head comes off.  I want to fart in his face first.  Feel free.  All right, we'll do some things with it.  We'll make a good YouTube video.  Hopefully it'll go viral for us.  George in Ohio, what's up?  Hey, man.  I wanted to put what I learned today.  Okay.  I learned that OB has a perfect package.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island. 
[03:32:30]  Rob?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I just learned that Governor McGreevy had to fuck a fake ass all over a funnel just  to get his wife pregnant.  That was a great line today.  Punching out, boy.  Thank you, Rob.  Rooster the trucker.  Rooster.  Good morning.  Hey.  OB, I want to nominate you for the line of the day when you said about the midgets driving  the car.  Must look like they're driving a monster truck.  Oh, that was a good one.  Punching out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Are we ready for the line of the day?  Need to listen.com mention, line of the day poll included. 
[03:33:00]  What's this, Iraq?  I like to listen.com.  Yes, we know that website.  All right.  After today's line of the day, you can vote for line of the week on I like to listen.com.  Wow.  That should be exciting.  Yeah.  And we'll give the results tomorrow.  All right.  Wow.  Can't wait to see who wins.  Who wins line of the week?  Line of the week.  Wow.

[03:33:30]  Get your votes in.  Brandon, what's up?  Hey, just wanted to find out your thoughts on Fez's little rant yesterday about how he's  in love with your sister.  Yeah.  Well, who isn't?  Who isn't?  But for some reason, I don't know what it is, even though after hearing that, for some  reason, I feel like my sister is pretty safe with Fez.  What happened?  I don't know why.  I just got this inkling.  Fez is professing his love for my sister, but he's saying that it can't work out because 
[03:34:00]  the family, you know, being Italian and all, doesn't accept him.  My family doesn't accept him.  But I'm warming up to the idea because there's something about Fez.  I can't quite put my finger in it, on it, that it's, well, a little Freudian slip, that  I just feel that my sister is safe with him.  I don't know what I mean by that.  Just, just safe.  Nothing really bad could happen or would happen. 
[03:34:30]  Watch it out, boys.  That's all.  All right.  I had a little conversation about my sister yesterday.  All right.  It's very sweet.  Tim, what did you learn on the show today?  Tiger Woods' job is to hit golf balls.  His wife's job is to fuck him and smile.  There's the R.  Ryan, what's up?  Hey there, guys.  Hey.  I want to play, oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  What I learned today.  What?  What I learned today is no matter how many times you guys play Steve, it's still going to 
[03:35:00]  be funny.  It's still funny, right?  Steve.  All right.  Thank you, man.  Pizza.  Hey, guys.  Let's go out for pizza.  Jeff in Florida.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I think under the weather, Opie might have had a potential line of the day when  that caller says, man, the guy talks real weird.  Yeah, he sounds like he's deaf.  And Opie said, yeah, he got the hearing fucked out of him.  How's it going?  Is that possible, Dr. Opie?  Oh, no.  That you have the hearing fucked out of you? 
[03:35:30]  Got a lot of fans today.  Chris in Florida.  Chris.  Opie, you got the line of the day when you said McGreevey got the hearing fucked out  of him.  Line of the day.  Might have been too late in the show, though.  Oh, no.  I won't make any excuses.  It's time for line of the day.  All right.  Brazil.  Jimmy's been there.  Wait.  Is this the runner-up?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Runner-up.  All right.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  All right.  Brazil.  Jimmy's been there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happens in Brazil if you go with a bunch of guys?  You bring money and you fuck the indigenous women. 
[03:36:00]  Yes, that was very funny.  And it summed it up.  It was factual and funny.  It was truthful.  Yeah.  I like to tell the truth.  Now, is that just the runner-up or is that third or something?  Two more to go?  Just one more.  Just the winner.  All right.  This is it.  Line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:36:30]  Say you're going out for the night.  God bless you, sweetie.  Pick up your lover.  Yeah.  And bring him back as some type of business associate.  And you need to do some work privately in the governor's office.  Then you eat his ass on your desk.  Right.  Right on the blotter.  And you spread his dirty, oniony cheeks.  And you bury your gubernatorial face. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  There it is.  Oh.  Jim Garnett gets line of the day.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Spirited line of the day.  Gubernatorial.  You pull that out of your ass late in the show, bro.  That was only five minutes ago.  Oh, damn.  That's not a good one.  Right on.  Pinchy.  Today I learned Anthony would rather go on a fancation than a mancation.  Right.  A fancation.  You're going to be at the station tomorrow, Pinch?  Unfortunately, no.  I will be at the show, though. 
[03:37:30]  Okay.  I know Pinchy's from Cleveland.  Good man.  Yes, sir.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  See you later.  I guess that's it.  We can end there.  Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.  We got to be at the airport and, like, oof.  Soon enough.  Soon enough, we'll say.  Yes.  All right.  So we'll talk to you guys.  We'll be on tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning, live from Cleveland.  Bye.  We need your help, though, because we're not hurting Cleveland in the morning, but we're  doing our show in the morning.  So we'll be at the station, K-Rock, from 6 to about noon, noon-ish, because I think we  have meetings after that. 
[03:38:00]  Don't worry.  Everyone will hear everything exactly as they would have if we were here.  Yeah, they know that.  Yeah.  Well, the XMers will hear it live.  Yeah.  So.  Don't worry about it.  Stop by the station if you're in the area and say hi, okay?  All right, guys.  Am I?  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  You know, the funny thing is, too, here comes the world's dumbest jingle.  At least it's a fucking jingle.  I'll show the world I'm a funny guy.  I'll throw in some sound effects, and a few lines that don't make no sense, and both an ant 
[03:38:30]  will be so proud of me.  Thank you.  I missed the fight completely.  I should kill myself discreetly.  This jingle has opened my suit, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.  My life's been kind of rough, and 18 years is long enough.  My dad should have hopped the gun away.  Yay!  I got nothing. </pre>
