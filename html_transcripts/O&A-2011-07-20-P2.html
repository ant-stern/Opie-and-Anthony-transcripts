<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After ONA Live" show, hosted by Sam Roberts, focused heavily on the aftermath of a previous segment featuring a phone call from Sam's mother.  The broadcast centered on listener calls and the hosts’ reactions to Sam's mother’s participation, using sexually suggestive and crude language directed at her.  Significant discussion revolved around the possibility of Sam's mother hosting the "After Show" in Sam's absence at Comic-Con.  Several co-workers, including Eric, Troy, and Danny, joined the conversation, both in person and via phone calls.  The conversation frequently digressed.  One notable digression involved an anecdote about a co-worker's sugar-induced vandalism—using french fries to damage a keyboard and grease a monitor.  Another bizarre event described was a surreal musical performance featuring Chubby Checker with a Black Sabbath cover band. The overarching and recurring theme throughout the show was the humorous, and often offensive, reactions to and discussion about Sam's mother's earlier appearance on the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I don't know what we just had to sit through.  I'm sure all you enjoyed it, but it was difficult for some of us.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live, and I'm Sam Roberts.  For the last hour, it must have been an hour, my mother was on the phone. 
[00:00:30]  And I told her not to answer these questions, but the minute that she said her shower has no door or curtain, I knew that it was trouble.  I mean, why would you admit that? I don't know.  And it's like, this is what I hope people realize is my contribution.  We all get our turn in the barrel.  Well, most of us.  Eric definitely takes his turn in the barrel. 
[00:01:00]  There's no denying that, and a lot of people credit that, and people should credit that.  Eric, you do a great job in the barrel.  Thank you.  And you take a lot of shit.  That I do.  But, who else has to sit there and listen to their mother take that kind of abuse?  Well, that's your fault for allowing her to come on.  She loves it, doesn't she?  Your mom's a freak.  I don't know if she's a freak.  Air whore.  I guess being an air whore must run in the family.  Everybody's just reaching for that mic in the Roberts household. 
[00:01:30]  But hopefully she's doing all right.  I mean...  What if we book her...  On the after show?  To do the after show while you're in San Diego.  I don't know if she can handle hosting the after show yet.  We'll help her out.  No, we'll have the phone lines open.  We'll have a...  You know what?  There's no way that I trust you animals around my mother unsupervised.  Well, I'm just putting it out there, because you're going to be gone for a few days.  Well, yeah.  I'm going to Comic Con, but no.  That's not going to happen. 
[00:02:00]  She won't be in this studio.  She won't be calling in.  What if we let people vote?  People can vote all they want.  Unfortunately, what people don't realize about after Opie and Anthony Live is there's nothing  democratic about it.  They could call in and say, like, do we want to hear, you know, me with your pre-recorded  stuff, or would they rather hear a live person and have your mom host the show?  Listen, my mom got an hour of air time today.  866-969-1969.  What's this guy want? 
[00:02:30]  Who's that?  That's the main phone.  You know what to do.  It's Danny.  You know what to do.  Danny, you're on the air.  What's up?  I can barely hear your microphone.  Oh.  Oh, that's weird.  It's all the way up.  Yeah, you're on the show.  Hey, it's Lady Trucker.  Oh, thank God, Lady Trucker.  Oh, Sam, you know, it could have been a whole lot worse.  They could have talked about your mommy.  You have an unlatch for me, or mommy's tits.  That's what they did talk to. 
[00:03:00]  I mean, they didn't say the phrase unlatch from her tits, but that was what was implied  through a lot of it.  Yeah, but, you know, and then, uh...  Uh, you're on the air now.  Hey, put her on.  I want to hear it.  I'd be jacking all day.  Listen to that.  Jesus Christ.  You see, this is...  People like you are the reason why I won't do it.  He hung up.  He's probably going to jack off somewhere.  Uh, you're on the show now. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, hello.  Um, who's to stop her from coming in if you're out in San Diego?  Well, nobody's going to...  Nobody can physically stop her, but this is my show, and she's my mother.  And she should host the show.  Why?  Go in and step up the back for her little boy.  Why should my mother host the show?  Because everybody enjoys the great and wonderful radio that she provides.  I will tell you this.  But you have to admit, she's a genius, the way she got herself out of a very bad place 
[00:04:00]  at the end of that phone call by letting the guys know it was 10 o'clock.  Oh, absolutely, before they made her put a price tag on the picture.  Yeah.  I mean, smart.  She's smart.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, geez.  Eric, you filled up the phone lines again.  I told you.  I tell everybody this.  They take for granted.  They go, oh, Sam's show.  Who listens to that?  You start answering these phone calls,  you're going to fill them up. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, let's just throw it out there.  You want me to keep going?  Yeah, keep going.  Because I normally don't take calls.  Well, I have another option if you want, but you should take a few calls.  Okay, I'll take this call.  You're on the air.  361.  Hey, how you doing, Sam?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, man, I think you should have your watch.  There's enough replays going on on SiriusXM, dude.  Have your mom come on, and at least it'll be a live show.  Get phone calls.  Here's some input.  It'll be great, dude.  Yeah, but I mean, wouldn't it be easier for my mother if I was kind of here guiding her 
[00:05:00]  through a little bit?  No.  She don't need a babysitter.  She's 27 years old.  She's a little older than you.  She can handle herself.  I guarantee it.  All right.  Would you...  Just...  Plus, but I'll tell you this, that's going to make my dad very jealous.  Now, your dad might want to go with her, but you don't need to be there.  So you'd like to listen to an after show of my parents hosting the show?  No, just your mom. 
[00:05:30]  Just my mom.  Your dad gets in the corner to make sure they don't talk her out of her clothes or nothing.  But just your mom, yeah.  Okay.  What about you, buddy?  You're on the air.  Sam, I'd love to hear your mom on the radio.  And just think, maybe Jimmy can come back early, take your mom out for a nice dinner.  No.  No.  Jim will be with me in San Diego.  What's the thing, Jimmy?  The girl, I'll fuck her on his couch.  Jesus.  You're gone.  And you're on after Opie and Anthony live. 
[00:06:00]  Sam, you're going by any day.  She gets thrown under the bus just once, and we can't stop whining about it.  Get your mom on the air with Jeff, and we'll have him French kissing me.  So you're telling me that I need to stop whining, and I need to have my mother and my fiancee making out with each other?  Yeah.  Great idea.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  You see what I mean, Eric?  It's not working.  Well, if you don't like that idea, I mean, because we can always run your stuff, I thought the audience might want to hear your mom host the show. 
[00:06:30]  What we could do, if you're interested, we could do your mom and your dad hosting the show, both of them together.  And would they be going in and out of bits?  They could do bits.  They could take phone calls.  They could talk about walking around Sirius, what they see out the studio here, talk to people in the hallway.  They could do whatever they want.  Who would anchor them, though?  Who would be here to help? 
[00:07:00]  We all would.  We all be here to help them out.  Who's we all?  Travis, Danny, myself.  I don't trust most of you.  Roland.  Listen, I've got to be honest with you guys.  Roland will help out.  I don't trust most of you sons of bitches.  Troy can escort your mom in and out.  What's that supposed to mean?  He's just a very nice young boy.  He's a man whore is what he is.  Troy's a little loopy today, too, because he was up all night DJing, I hear.  I'd love to talk to him.  I never remember the name of the place, otherwise I'd plug it.  6-7-5-BAR.  6-7-5-BAR.  You're on the air, 978. 
[00:07:30]  Hey, Sam.  I'm not even kidding around.  I would love to hear your parents on the air.  I find them fascinating.  Why is that?  They seem to have lived an interesting life, and they were able to help you through it.  I really do find them interesting.  Not even going for a joke.  Well, all right.  I mean, if there are people who think that my family is that interesting, I mean, I'm  not opposed to putting them on the air.  You're on the air now, 708.  Here's Coke Logic.  Oh, what's up?  Coke Logic? 
[00:08:00]  What I'm thinking is primetime Bobby Roberts.  Yeah.  And your old man talking about the greatest treats of all time.  So, it's just like my mom and dad sitting here doing After Open Anthony Live, talking about  sardine sandwiches and buttermilk.  Yeah, just keep Troy Kwan away, because he'll probably try to fuck your mom.  Yeah, he probably, he's kind of developed that reputation.  Where's, Troy?  Troy, where is Troy?  I'll find him.  Thank you.  Yeah, I would like to talk.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  Oh, you're calling him.  Okay.  We'll listen to that. 
[00:08:30]  I am going to be in San Diego in a little bit.  We'd like to play if we could.  Oh, there's Troy.  We found him, Eric.  You heard my mom on the air today, right, Troy?  Yeah.  You're a little off kilter from, I mean, Wednesday's a rough day for you.  I feel great.  You do?  Yeah, I feel like a million bucks.  Oh, all right.  Good.  Yeah.  What fuels you?  Coffee.  Okay.  Adrenaline.  It's not like life or like, it's coffee.  Some days.  Yeah, not today. 
[00:09:00]  But whatever.  I'm here.  Whatever works.  Yeah.  You got the coffee in you, right?  I'm here.  So, you're fueled.  Let's do it.  You heard my mom on the air.  Yeah.  If she were up here without me, would you try to have sex with her?  No.  See, I'm different than everybody else here.  I say leave your mom alone.  Oh, so this whole segment you were thinking.  No, I was cringing a little bit.  I mean, I was too.  You saw me.  Yeah.  But it's like, I think deep down inside you think it's funny.  You know what I mean?  Because you kind of volunteer your mom. 
[00:09:30]  You kind of push her.  Like, if you didn't want your mom on the air, you would just be like, no, no, no.  Above all else.  I want something good on the air.  Right.  And, you know, if my mother has to bear the brunt of that, so be it.  But at the same time, you know, this chick, my mom, has called in God knows how many times  to do this show.  No, I know.  I know.  But she's such a sweetheart.  She's a beautiful person.  And I just hate to hear her have to be subjected to this lambastity.  Are you kicking game right now?  No.  No, no, no, no.  Eric, is he being the sensitive guy kicking game right now? 
[00:10:00]  Well, when he walked in, when he said, you know my mom, right?  And he went, yeah.  And then he went.  Did you do that?  Yeah.  Like, sort of an orgasmic?  Like, yeah.  He was, like, really into it.  That's not cool, dude.  What the fuck?  I just, I breathed out.  I got something for you about your mom from Opie.  What's that?  Sam's mom is throwing the whole staff a pizza party.  That's not true.  That's not true.  No.  Yeah, he made that up.  We're still on to you right now.  I will say, it's funny that you say that moms are off limits and you are cringing a little 
[00:10:30]  bit.  Yeah.  Because Opie, who, like, and Jim were almost saying stuff that they were making each other  laugh.  A lot of the listeners, I'm sure, got where they were going.  But a lot of it, my mom, especially being on the other end of the phone, and she's listening  to this now, so she'll probably figure it out.  Dude, it's just carrot cake.  A lot of it was missed.  Hang on.  Somebody's on the hotline.  You're on the air.  I think mom.  Oh, Sam?  Yes.  I see you have Troy in the studio there. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And he thought the segment went really too far with your mom.  Yeah.  And me and Jimmy and Kenny were in the car, and we were just wondering what part got to  Troy.  What part, Troy?  When did you start to cringe?  Well, you know.  And hold on.  Part two.  Speak slowly and with details, please.  Well, I feel like they have ulterior motives, but what made you cringe?  I don't know.  It just...  No, no, you do. 
[00:11:30]  What made you cringe?  Huh?  Troy.  Yo.  They didn't even bring up her urinating in the shower.  Oh, what the fuck, Kenny?  Who gave you the phone?  We all had the phone.  It's a speaker phone.  Yeah, it's a Bluetooth.  But what's this homeless guy covering up?  Oh, that's Jesus.  Oh.  I think somebody ran over his lunch.  They found homeless Jesus.  Troy, what was the part that made you cringe?  Oh, here comes Paul Poe.  No, Jesus, who I have filmed many times on the street.  He was just in the middle of... 
[00:12:00]  Where are we?  On Broadway?  Yeah.  Is it by TD Bank?  Broadway.  Just really pissed off about something.  What did Jesus got to be pissed about?  Yeah?  Yeah?  Is it true your mom's nickname is Backward Cowgirl?  Kenny, I thought you were like Mr. Positivity.  Oh, there's nothing wrong with that nickname.  You're incorrigible, Club Soda.  I mean, you know, you don't like it when your family's brought up, but now you're asking... 
[00:12:30]  Not your family.  Your personal items are brought up, and now you're asking if my mother's nickname is Backwards Cowgirl.  Your mom's a star.  She is a public person at this point.  Sam, ask Troy what went too far.  I'm really curious.  No, it's fine.  It was fine.  And you said you were cringing.  It was a little cringing, because I know your mom.  That's why.  And why do you know her?  I love your honesty on our show, believe it or not.  So just get into it.  What went too far?  No, it's fine.  I know his mom, and she's just such a sweet person, and just having to be subjected to that, 
[00:13:00]  it made me cringe a little bit.  But it's fine.  To the listener...  But what part made you cringe?  It's okay.  Well, I don't know if it was an exact part, as opposed to an hour of just constant lambasting  of, you know, putting this poor woman through the ringer.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just an hour.  Like, I put myself, my mother, in that position, and I would be... I would cringe hearing  that, so... 
[00:13:30]  I would be proud.  ...knowing her.  And she's not a pig.  She's a wonderful woman.  So I cringed a little bit.  But to the listener that doesn't know your mom, Sam, I'm sure it was hysterical.  Right.  Well, I mean, do you blame me for allowing this to happen?  No, I don't know.  Hey, it's your mom.  You know what I mean?  It's...  But are you sitting there going, like, what the fuck is Sam doing allowing this to happen  to his mom?  But she's a good sport.  Right.  She can play along.  She knows the show.  You said she listens every single day.  Yes.  So she knows what she's getting herself into.  Yes. 
[00:14:00]  So it's not like she's completely blindsided.  And, I mean, and I told this to a caller, again, give that woman credit for the fact  that she was in a corner, and she pulled out the...  Guys, you know it's 10 o'clock, right?  Got herself right out.  I literally looked down.  It was 10 o'clock.  Yeah, on the dot.  She was looking at that clock.  I think she was counting it down, yeah.  She's a smart lady.  Now, Troy, I mean, you're being a...  You're being a puttaker.  Tell us what part got you.  Yeah, well, there must have been...  I mean, there wasn't a specific thing that was...  I mean, everything that was said was, you know... 
[00:14:30]  What was really bad?  Not what was the tipping point.  What was really bad?  Sexual stuff with mom.  With sexual stuff.  We didn't go there.  Yes, you did, Opie.  You actually...  Like, Jim...  We weren't talking about her sex habits.  We were talking about her showering.  Yeah, but you were talking about her private parts.  And Jim and Ant were kind of beating around the bush, where Opie, you just literally said  what was...  When Opie gets literal like that, is that when you kind of go, ugh. 
[00:15:00]  Did you have to do that?  But, I mean...  Like, when Opie says the P word...  After we started that game, and I just wanted to be part of the game, that's all.  I was within the boundaries of the game.  That was set forth.  I know, and sometimes you don't know, but it wasn't within the boundaries, because they  were kind of beating around the bush, and you just blurted the P word out there.  When Opie did that, is that when you were kind of like, oh...  Like, we knew what was...  Did you have to say it? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, but I...  You know, it's funny.  You know, so...  It's fine.  Is it?  Is it funny?  I mean, it's your mom.  So, is it funny?  Is it?  All you care about is making sure it's good content on the air, but it's your mom.  Sam, how much fun is it when Troy answers a question with a question?  It's so great.  Is it?  I mean, do you think it's fun?  Right.  He throws it back at you.  Yeah.  No, but I mean, you know, Opie's not going to get offended, because I... 
[00:16:00]  Why is Troy scared?  I want details.  I want really, man, cringe.  It's okay.  It's all right.  You're speaking for a portion of the audience that probably cringed as well.  I think Troy probably cringed at stuff you did, Opie, and he doesn't necessarily want  to say it with you right here.  No, there's nothing...  Oh my God, what about the stuff Anthony was saying?  That whole scenario of coming out of the shower with the steam and all that.  With the Fast Times music playing, how did you...  Yeah, I mean, it's funny.  It's funny, but it's still...  It's cringe, but that's the point, right? 
[00:16:30]  What about this, Troy?  To me, what started everything on an ugly note was the minute my mom said, I just got  out of the shower, Jim started touching his penis.  Well, the funny thing is that he would probably never care if that got on the air, that that  happened.  You had just brought that to everybody's attention.  Yeah.  That's what's funny to me.  Okay, Troy.  This is it.  This is how we end it, because we're going to be home soon.  The three things that made you cringe, from three, two, one. 
[00:17:00]  Okay.  And you have to answer this, and you can't answer with a question.  If you answer this.  Top three...  The three things in the conversation made you cringe the hardest, number three, number  two, number one.  Go, Troy.  Quat.  Well, probably having to...  Sam having to deal with the sexual stuff with Jess.  Okay, so the premarital...  Yeah.  And then when he said front and the...  Yeah.  In the bed.  Because no mom wants to hear that.  No.  Okay, so...  It's just like...  What part of the premarital sex? 
[00:17:30]  The sex one, or...  Yeah.  And now you know my mom's still listening, so it's kind of like, uh...  Yeah.  I mean, just having to say that in front of your mom, because your mom is...  She's such a sweet woman.  You know what I mean?  So it's like, ah, having to deal with that.  And then she has to see Jess, and then it's just...  It's like, it's all in the back of everybody's mind that that happened.  You know what I mean?  So I guess I'm putting...  I'm stepping out of, as a listener, and listening to more as like a friend of Sam, like, oh  no, he has to now deal with this.  So number three goes to Jim. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Number two.  The premarital sex thing?  Yes, we already went on...  Yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  That's good enough.  All right, number two, Troy Quat.  Uh, definitely the sexual stuff with her, because...  Which one?  The pussy mention, and the...  Opie, then.  Yeah.  Opie got number two.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, man, that's wrong.  Well, because it's your mom, dude, you know?  It's not a person you sexualize.  Damn, I don't remember what I said.  What did I say?  I forgot.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Okay. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, I'm on it back.  Everyone say goodbye to Jimmy.  Bye.  Bye, Jimmy.  All right, have a good trip.  In a couple days, Jimmy.  Hopefully Sam and I won't be killed.  All right.  Jesus, why would you say that?  It's going to upset Jess.  All right, I need...  So, Sam, I don't remember exactly what I said that was uncomfortable moment number two.  I mean, Troy, it was your moment.  What was it that Opie said?  Well, he had pushed it to...  It was sort of alluding to something, and then Opie had just flat out said...  Troy. 
[00:19:00]  Pussy.  We haven't taught you about radio yet.  There's a whole new audience listening right now.  They have no idea what you're saying, so just say it.  Well, I don't remember the exact wording of what was said.  I'm sure Sam could help you out.  Well, he was talking about a heart, and he said, I'm talking about the...  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  What was it?  Well, I don't remember the exact details of what he was saying.  Okay.  Well, what was the word, and what was it in reference?  The cut of the hair they were talking about. 
[00:19:30]  Right, exactly.  What, you guys, rookies?  Well, I'm trying to lead Troy to it, because this is his moment.  Yeah, Troy, this is your moment.  You were uncomfortable because I asked heart-shaped or bald.  And then someone said, what are you talking about?  And then everyone thought I was going to go double entendre like Jimmy and Ant did, but  I decided...  You flat out said pussy, right?  Yeah, you didn't like that.  Well, it's funny.  But you cringed.  It's funny.  I cringed a little bit.  And, and...  The number one cringe moment of the segment. 
[00:20:00]  We went to three and two.  What's one?  Probably the shower.  Ant's shower scenario.  Ant's shower scenario.  When he said the nipples.  Yeah, but it was funny.  I don't...  I'm not saying that it wasn't funny.  Mm-hmm.  I just...  Just because I know her, I cringed a little bit.  Another question.  And, and Sam, more importantly, is Bobby going to make good and bring treats in next  week?  Because she didn't give us the radio we were hoping for today.  Well, honestly, the next time I see her, she will ask what day she should make the treats 
[00:20:30]  for.  And I'm going to tell her, don't make the treats.  You don't have to make them.  Don't make them.  But, of course, she will insist.  And I'm hoping one of them is that lovely key lime pie.  Well, I think what I'm going to do is try to see if Ant and Jim will really show up  to my house and have my mom throw an Opie and Anthony barbecue at my house.  Barbecue?  No, we need treats next week.  And speaking of pie, Sam...  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Speaking of pie...  Parcifterball.  What the...  I...  I know what you're talking about.  I'm not going to bother asking.  Opie, you've been on a tirade lately, just taking shots at people.  You've been on fire.  You're Mr...  I mean, you've been funny.  Don't get me wrong.  But, I mean, it's going to affect relationships.  Our relationship?  No, no.  Me and you are fine.  But there are other people around here.  My mother.  Co-hosts of other shows that probably won't be as happy with you. 
[00:21:30]  Why is that, Sam?  Because of the comments that you made all day today.  That was a car door slamming.  That was that.  And Opie decided the conversation had ended.  That everything in my life is fair game.  Yeah.  I don't have any secrets that I can think of.  I try to let everything be fair game.  You know, as long as it's not going to hurt people.  Let my parents come on the air.  My siblings should come on the air if they came up. 
[00:22:00]  Jess has been on the air a hundred times.  Like, whatever.  Because I talk about other people so much.  You can talk about me.  I'll talk about me however much you want.  But the thing is, though, you do have to kind of emotionally and as a human being shut yourself off and just be a machine in the studio saying, I'm just listening to a radio show.  Right.  Like, the woman that I heard on the phone in that last segment, I could not associate with that as my mother. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  But when the microphones are off, you leave this building, that woman is still your mother.  And this did happen.  What's funny is that I've had segments like this where I've been like, ugh.  Like, I wish that hadn't gone so far.  Yeah.  Like, I'll talk about things like, you know, my mom and dad, you know, say stuff about how their relationship is.  And I'm just like, after the show, I'm going, why did I have to, you know, there was no reason to even bring them up at all.  And just for the sake of kind. 
[00:23:00]  And then I go to my parents' house to see what the vibe is.  And they go, hey, Sam, funny stuff on the show today.  You want a sandwich?  And everything is just like it never even happened.  Like, I guess sometimes that's just the best way to deal with things.  Yeah.  Just ignore them like they never even happened.  And that is kind of, we're not a, like, you know, an emotionally whatever family that sits down and talks about all kinds of feelings and stuff.  Right.  So, I mean, you did something for the sake of a humorous radio show.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  And that's where it sits.  And that's great.  And I admire you for that.  I don't know if I could do that.  Uh-huh.  But at the end of the day, though, that's still your mom.  So I would imagine it's still in both of the back of your minds.  You wouldn't bring your family into this show?  I wouldn't subject my mom to that.  You know what I mean?  But my mom is not as cool as your mom.  Right.  She would take things personally.  Very personally.  Very personally.  And there are things about her she wouldn't necessarily want public on the radio for a bunch of people who are animals that listen to this show.  Yes.  Very much so.  Specifically this audience, not just in general public. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  Eric.  Yeah.  You take enough shit that you don't ever have to worry about private people in your life becoming public.  Yeah.  Which is a wise move if you're trying to keep them private.  But would everybody, like your wife, your mother, would these people be upset if they became show fodder?  The wife would be the biggest.  Really?  She doesn't like being public at all?  Well, it ties into a few other things.  But.  Because of the industry she works in. 
[00:24:30]  Exactly.  Okay.  So that's not even an option.  Right.  But what about on a personal level?  I guess we'd have to run it by her.  I can't really answer for that because.  What's your guess?  Do you think, like, if you went on the air and said, oh, my wife did so and so and so and so, it pisses me off when she does this.  Last night we were doing.  Oh, that kind of stuff I think would be all right.  But what if it got personal?  Yeah.  He'll be sleeping in one of our couches.  Yeah.  She wouldn't put up with it, Roland.  You know her.  She wouldn't like it.  It's not a matter of her getting upset or whatever. 
[00:25:00]  It's a matter of, does this mess with other things that she has to do?  What about your mom?  I never bring my mom into anything.  Like, my dad's been on the air a couple of times.  Yeah, he's been on the show.  And he can go with the flow pretty well.  You know, he's an older gentleman and everything.  And he got along great.  My mom, this is not the world for her.  No.  No.  Does she listen?  She does once in a while.  What does she think of the way you're treated?  She's not happy with that.  She turns it off whenever she hears something about me. 
[00:25:30]  What do your parents think of me?  My dad thinks you're a little shit.  And that's because of the way I treat his son?  Yeah, but he doesn't hate you.  Sometimes he just wants to cave your head in.  I mean, if your dad, at some points in his life, didn't want to cave my head in, he wouldn't be a very good dad, would he?  No.  You know what, though?  It's like when you're out in the playground and you get your ass kicked.  Yeah.  Okay.  And that's when your dad comes home and you're like, your dad goes, look, son, man the fuck up. 
[00:26:00]  Go back tomorrow and punch that motherfucker right in the face.  Who's your dad, Rocky?  No.  But you're right.  So, Eric, does your dad ever, that's what you're getting at, right?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know why your dad doesn't say, and Sam does take fucking with really good.  There was an hour of fucking with Sam beyond what a lot of people could deal with.  So, I don't know why when Sam is picking on Eric, Eric just doesn't fire back at you. 
[00:26:30]  He just sort of sits there and takes it.  Eric, does your dad wish that you would fight back a little more?  No, he just, he thinks you're annoying.  Well, then, he should fight back a little more.  I bet you, Jess is probably mad at you.  Not at you, but.  Jess has been brought up on this show so many times.  What about Dimasha?  Why do they do this?  Jess doesn't like, Jess starts to feel uncomfortable when they talk about my mom mothering me and  not liking her, because then, she's like you said, like, this is a conversation that is 
[00:27:00]  happening, so she starts to think, oh my god, that's true, that's true, like, not realizing  that there are things that are exaggerated for the sake of the radio show, which, by the  way, for all of you listening, there are things that are exaggerated for the sake of the  radio show.  Steve Sterniola, they spent an hour on the phone with my mom today.  I heard some of it, tail end of it.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Would this be something that, you're working on Funny in the Morning, another edgy morning  show here on SiriusXM. 
[00:27:30]  Is this something that Sonny Fox would do to you?  No.  I've called my mom on the air, but just so I could control it, like, I wouldn't trust,  you know what I mean?  Like, listeners, because listeners would be like, oh, I want to tell Steve's mom how sweet  she is, and then they'd be like, you'd get on and be like, you're a cunt.  Yeah, exactly.  It's funny that you said that, because Opie, last time my mom was on the phone, he played  the Mel Gibson drop, calling her a cunt, and hung up on her.  But this is what I'm talking about. 
[00:28:00]  So then I go, and then Opie, every time, he goes, was that too far?  And I go, like, what do you even bother asking me for?  You're just going to do it again.  But, so I go to my mom's house after work that day, just to be like, you know, am I  going to have to do damage control?  And I go, hey, and she goes, oh, that was fun this morning.  And that's it.  Oh, that's, she actually likes it.  Yeah.  My mom liked being on the air, but no one, there was no cunt mentions, no twats or whores  or.  I'm not quite sure your mom likes it.  She probably cries like an hour before you get home.  I think your mom loves you, and is very supportive of what you do, and if you think that it's 
[00:28:30]  a good idea to bring her on there, she will do whatever it takes for you.  So she is going on the air because she thinks it'll be beneficial to me.  Yes.  And I guess that rang through when Opie was trying to get her to talk about management,  and how she immediately said, don't bring this up, don't bring this up, because she  got into defense mode.  Your mom, you can tell your mom actually is extremely proud of you, to be serious, just  because you heard her tell Opie when he's like, well, why don't you guys go down the  hall?  That was funny when she did that. 
[00:29:00]  Why don't you guys go down the hall?  She's like, why don't you guys go do it?  Exactly.  And then, of course, that question was completely deflected real quick.  A 36-floor elevator ride meeting.  Yeah.  And the Troy Quant, he did a question with another question.  The phones are still going crazy.  What do you want to talk about, 315?  Where are you from?  Hey, is this Sam?  Yes, it is.  Where are you from?  You're on the air.  Upstate New York.  Syracuse?  It's River Rat Dock.  Oh, what's up, buddy?  Hey, I have an idea for you.  Why don't you have your mom make some treats, some of her baked good treats. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I won't have any entendres with that word.  Thank God.  Sell them on eBay, all right, for the O&A fans and the after O&A fans.  And the proceeds, half of the proceeds go to her darling son.  Half?  How about all of the proceeds?  They're her baked goods.  Where are the other half going to go to?  You negotiate that with your mom.  But apparently, she's an awesome cook, right?  And we hear about it all the time.  So have her basically make something, put it on eBay, kind of like how Sleeve sold a song,  you know, and then sell it on eBay.  Ooh, delicious carrot cake. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, but I don't know if baked goods through the mail work.  They do at QVC.  They do?  Yeah, everybody.  But don't you have to freeze dry them or something?  Nah.  All right, thanks, River Rat.  They have a special thing now.  Maybe if you just hold out, you'll win the lottery through a newspaper or something like that.  Are you talking, you think shots at Eric again?  I, I, after that story.  Did you hear that, Troy?  Yeah.  He's taking, every time Steve Sturniolo, who's been on the after, by the way, the after show  made him a virus celebrity.  I should.  Every time he comes on this show, he's got something to say about that. 
[00:30:30]  No, no.  You know what, though?  That's not even a shot.  That's just really fortunate luck on Eric's part.  Yeah, you're not kidding.  That's a lot of money, so maybe build out.  Eric's been, Eric's been very lucky in his life.  That is a huge, fortunate turn of luck to win that lottery.  That's amazing, actually.  And there's no shot in there.  Eric's going to yell and scream.  I can see him pulling the mic.  Whoa, Eric?  Nah, Eric doesn't give a shit.  He won.  Yeah, exactly.  Congratulations.  That's actually good.  So why wouldn't, can, does Eric have any pull to go down the hall and talk to management  for you?  What?  Well, no way.  No, no way.  Are you a fucking asshole?  I don't know.  I don't know the workings of your guys.  Does Eric have any pull? 
[00:31:00]  Eric, do you have any pull?  No one here has any pull.  Only on the force of gravity.  Oh, shit.  Eric, it was easy for me.  It was an easy one for me to go to, Eric.  That's beneath you, Sam.  You're better than that.  I know.  And somewhere out there, Mr. Nagel, I'm sorry.  Please don't attack me.  Eric's dad, Papa Nagel.  I didn't mean it, I swear.  Do they ever call other people's moms, by the way?  No.  Just out of curiosity.  Just mine.  Just mine.  Eric, why don't they call you, like, you keep that number separate?  No, there's a civilian rule around here.  Except with Sam.  Well, Sam opened it up.  Sam invited that in. 
[00:31:30]  I came in here, they said there's a civilian rule, and I said, fuck the civilian rule.  And I've told everybody in my life, whether you're my friend, you're my fiance, you're  a member of my family, shit could go down and you could end up on the air.  This whole shit right here.  That's why you can't fuck with Sam, though, for picking on everybody and fucking with everybody.  It's because, like, he opens himself way up worse than anybody else is willing to.  Everything.  Yeah.  Well, he does, but he's really good at everyone hates Sam, and then Sam gets in the room, and 
[00:32:00]  then everyone hates each other, and everyone loves, you know what I mean?  He's very good at...  He's a master manipulator.  He is.  He's really good at what he does.  I agree.  I'm not a manipulator.  Yes, you are.  You are.  I just speak the truth.  Sam.  I speak gospel.  You know how to wordplay.  You know how to wordplay and manipulate a situation very well.  I tell the truth, and I say the things that the people want to hear.  I'm a modern day shit starter.  Yeah.  I agree.  I was going to say Jesus, but go ahead, Eric.  So where are we at with your mom and dad hosting 10 o'clock?  I don't think...  It doesn't make any sense to do it without me here. 
[00:32:30]  No.  And plus, it'll be overkill.  Well, like, everybody will enjoy it for five minutes, and then it's like, all right.  I think everyone would love it.  No, because Opie won't be here.  Anthony and Jim won't be here.  I think we should go back to the phones, and let's see what the people say.  Well, I think that you should get a show if you want to do that.  Why are you so insistent on this?  He loves phones.  He keeps driving at home.  Like, we've got to get him to host.  We've got to get him to host.  You got it, Eric.  I'm just trying to come up with some other ideas while Sam's at Comic-Con. 
[00:33:00]  How about you screen the phone calls?  How about you do your own show?  I got called in.  Just run the board and turn your mic off.  Believe me.  Oh, like your job?  Look, I'm kicking his feet up.  And by the way, I love this.  Dan in Kansas.  I read the feedback.  Dan in Kansas.  Every show.  Anytime I mention Eric, he goes, Sam, leave Eric alone, you bitch.  I didn't do anything to Eric.  Eric, have I done anything to you today?  Not really, no.  Eric, line three's ringing.  No, it was Roland who did something to Eric.  What did Roland do?  Well, Eric came in to a league.  He was a little upset when he came in today. 
[00:33:30]  Why?  I was?  Why?  Weren't you?  No.  Oh, okay.  What was wrong?  Oh, nothing.  Never mind.  What was the assumption that was wrong?  No, I don't know.  Never mind.  Yeah, you do.  He knows.  Wow.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  About The Office, yes.  What was up with The Office?  Yeah.  Um, well, apparently, I, I, um, I blamed some other people that weren't at fault.  Oh, boy.  Listen, based on the sound that we all just heard together out there in Radioland, I'm  going to take a wild guess as to who is at fault. 
[00:34:00]  No, I, I, I made it.  I took the blame.  No, because.  What happened?  What happened, Eric?  Well, I came in today, and my desk was all messed up, and my keyboard was all messed  up.  Messed up in what way?  Um, smashed with french fries.  That sounds like a good, pleasant treat for you to walk into.  Yeah.  Start licking your keyboard.  Type and eat.  It was in the keys.  It was, um, the grease was all over papers on my desk. 
[00:34:30]  It was smeared on the monitor.  On the monitor?  You're saying french fry grease.  French fry grease on the monitor.  Oh, my God.  So.  Roland, why did you do that?  I had so much sugar yesterday.  I went crazy.  And threw fries at Sam and everything.  And Eric, who did you blame?  Um.  He sent Travis in there.  Like, Travis.  I was, I was pissed, because it was all over everything.  And I thought maybe some other people who I allow to use my profit machine, who also,  um, don't leave this producer studio. 
[00:35:00]  Who?  Who, who, who?  The, some guys from Ron and Fez.  There's only two guys on Ron and Fez, so it's probably the two of them.  The two of them.  Pepper and Mark Zito.  And, no, they don't usually leave the, the producer studio in the best of shape, so.  They don't?  No, they don't.  Wow.  So, I, I thought maybe.  What do they do in the studio?  They, they leave it a fucking shithole.  They do?  The Ron and Fez guys do?  Yeah.  There's pretzels, there's aspirin wrappers, there's, uh.  CDs from their guests everywhere, and shit on the floor.  Shit on the floor?  There's papers everywhere.  It's disgusting.  How do you guys leave it?  You leave it properly? 
[00:35:30]  Well, we clean it up.  I mean, you throw our shit away.  Yeah, we gotta keep it clean for 11 o'clock when they come on.  Hmm.  But.  But they take shits on the floor.  No, they don't actually shit.  They don't defecate on the floor.  Oh, that's what you said.  Shit being rubbish.  Oh, gotcha.  Okay.  I want to hear more about this keyboard, actually.  So, so what happened, Eric?  So, I thought, because my profit, uh, thing was on, and the keyboard was all mashed up,  I thought, alright, somebody was using the profit machine, it might, it had to have been  those guys, so I sent them an email asking if they were in there, did they have food,  what the hell was going on.  Eric said, I was vandalized.  So I'm pissed off, and then Roland goes, oh, no, no, no, that was me, I threw stuff at 
[00:36:00]  Sam.  He threw stuff at me, and it smeared into your shit.  Potato ended up in your keyboard.  In my keyboard, on the monitor, on my papers.  And you believe that?  No, because I looked at him, and he goes, Sam pissed me off, and I threw french fries.  And I started shaking the keyboard, and I'm like, how did it get in the keyboard?  And he turned around.  And Roland, what did I do to piss you off?  You said, hey, Roland, and I was like, what?  He goes, are you going to have your, uh, your delicious Wendy's Frosty? 
[00:36:30]  I was like, don't ask me again.  And then you threw fries all over the place?  I threw a large fry.  You told me you knocked your drink over.  Eric, do you understand Roland's lying?  I didn't piss him off, I had nothing to do with this?  See, usually when you catch Roland in a lie, he'll break into the hee hee hee thing,  because he can't hold the face.  Yeah, but then he doesn't tell you the truth, he tells you another lie.  It's a lie that's not as bad.  But he didn't laugh or anything, he was dead.  Because I had to take a shit.  Eric, I want you to know something.  Yeah.  Yesterday, Roland had a lot of sugar.  A lot of sugar. 
[00:37:00]  And he thought it would be funny to ruin your things.  To put grease on the, on, on, on, right here.  That's the start and the end of the story.  And the phone.  What, the phone?  No.  Right?  No?  I mean.  I had two large sodas.  I had sugar and like.  Did you put it on the phone, Roland?  No.  Yes or no?  No.  Roland?  No.  They were all the CDs that were on my desk.  Okay.  Listen.  I had greasy hands.  Yeah.  I had sugar in three weeks.  And I went crazy. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, I did with you with greasy hands.  You did go crazy.  I did.  I was.  Troy and Sam could test how nuts I went.  I want to talk about this more, but I got to go.  Got to go to San Diego.  How much time do we have left on the show, Eric?  You have four minutes.  I will buy you lunch today.  Fuck that.  Buy him a new keyboard.  All right.  Well, here's what we're going to do.  Eric doesn't need you to buy him lunch.  He's got it.  That lotto thing that Cernyolo was talking about.  Eric, why don't we play, in honor of Jim's birthday yesterday, it's still Jim's birthday  week, Chubby Checker playing with Sabra Cadabra. 
[00:38:00]  This was one of the most surreal moments in the history of the show.  Sabra Cadabra, a Black Sabbath cover band, was in playing.  Chubby Checker was on the show, and he ended up doing the twist with Sabra Cadabra.  Sounds interesting.  It was phenomenal.  We'll get into this whole keyboard thing.  We'll find out what happens next week.  My parents are not going to host.  There'll be some best of after Opie and Anthony Live in the next couple days. 
[00:38:30]  How do you do a best of of a wrap-up show?  Kind of.  It's not a fucking wrap-up show.  How do you do the best of a after show?  Let me tell you something.  On the wrap-up show, would you ever hear stuff like this?  Yeah, some kind of stuff.  All right, why don't you go be on their show?  You know what you won't hear?  They won't bite me.  You know what you won't hear on the after show?  Sternyolo.  Exactly.  Fuck out.  Wow.  Leave.  He told you.  Goodbye.  Yeah, you leave.  I'm going to end the show with you out of the room.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah?  You know what you don't hear on the show that he works on?  What?  Sternyolo.  Ah-ha.  You know what you don't hear on the show that Sternyolo works for?  What?  Laughs.  Anyone.  From anyone. 
[00:39:00]  Listeners, anyone.  You are a shitster.  I don't know what...  Yeah, but he knows that.  You smashed fries on my keyboard.  Yeah, I didn't do anything, Roland.  Hey, hey, hey.  You licked it.  You should thank me this morning.  You're like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, I'm a shit...  You're a fucking shitster, Roland, and you vandalized people's property.  And they went in to go get the security involved.  That's when Roland jumped in.  All right.  There's so much more.  Somebody write this down.  Because we're going to talk about it on Monday.  That lady hates you, Roland.  You keep breaking your IDs.  All right, all right, all right.  Troyquan.com. 
[00:39:30]  Troyquan.com to get his DJ gigs.  Wendy's.com.  Wendy's.com.  And notsam.com.  I did it for myself.  The after show is over.  We're going to play some Chubby Checker.  And then into Ron and Fez.  I'll be tweeting from San Diego.  I don't know if I'll be able to call in the show.  Me and Jim are leaving.  Goodbye, everybody.  Watch for the changes and try to keep up.  Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.  I want to.  But now, but now you got to pick it up. 
[00:40:00]  You got to pick it up fast.  Okay, let's see, let's see.  Here we go.  All right, let's see.  Chubby's getting up.  Let me hear you again.  Let me hear you again.  He's getting up.  Wow.  Yeah.  Once again.  When I cut down, I want to cut.  One, two, three.  Huh.  Come on, baby. 
[00:40:30]  Let's do the twist.  Come on, baby.  Let's do the twist.  Take me by my little head and go like this.  Come on and twist.  Yeah.  Baby twist.  Ooh, yeah.  Just like this. 
[00:41:00]  Come on, little miss.  And do the twist.  My daddy is sleeping.  And the mama ain't around.  Yeah.  Daddy's just sleeping.  And the mama ain't around.  Gonna twist and twist and twist.  To reach out the house down.  Come on and twist.  Yeah.  Baby twist.  Ooh, yeah.
