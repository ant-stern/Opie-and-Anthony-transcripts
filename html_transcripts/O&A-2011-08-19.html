<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion sparked by Jim Norton's satirical, inaccurate Red Eye review of "Eat Pray Love."  This led to a phone conversation with Sarah Arboleda, a blogger from Australia who had taken Norton's review seriously, criticizing it as sexist.  A heated debate ensued regarding the interpretation of Norton's humor and the perceived lack of compelling female-led films.  The hosts struggled to maintain contact with Arboleda throughout the segment, frequently criticizing producer Steve for his incompetence.  This segment was peppered with offensive language and sexually suggestive comments.  Following this, studio guests Big A, a cab driver, and Stalker Patty, a listener, were introduced.  The segment concluded with the hosts discussing their upcoming date and making crude jokes about their physical attributes.

Next, a "dating game" segment featured Big A and Stalker Patty.  Opie and Anthony, along with Bill Burr and other in-studio personalities, engaged in sexually suggestive and crude commentary about the contestants' appearances.  They encouraged physical interaction between Big A and Patty, focusing on highly explicit jokes and comments.  The contestants answered questions about their ideal dates, worst qualities, and preferred animal representations.  Big A expressed a desire for a better job and life, while Patty revealed anxieties about health and finances. The segment culminated in scheduling a date for them at Paisano's restaurant, with promises of a post-date report.  Pre-date coaching audio for Big A was teased, focusing on proper treatment of women, followed by snippets of audio from their actual date.

The date audio featured a Ferris wheel ride (where Big A's size was an issue), a visit to Paisano's, and a U2 cover band performance.  The in-studio discussion heavily focused on Big A's bad breath, with an intern, Bill, investigating a bad smell in the studio, eventually identifying it as coming from Stalker Patty.  Listener calls, discussions of Big A's dental hygiene, and speculation about a second date filled the segment.  The audio concluded with Big A abruptly rejecting Patty's friendship suggestion with a vulgar insult.  Interspersed were discussions about Katrina relief efforts, a caller's story about *Of Mice and Men*, and humorous commentary on a news story about a home invasion by a "pervert."

The show then covered a news story about a home invasion perpetrated by a "pervert" who left incriminating evidence, including a self-made nude picture. This was followed by an interview with Buzz Aldrin, during which they discussed the Apollo 11 mission, focusing on the landing, fuel levels, and Aldrin's experiences.  The hosts playfully teased Aldrin, and he shared his views on moon landing conspiracy theories, future space exploration, extraterrestrial life, and motion sickness in space.

Finally, the show ended with a montage of crying audio clips from various sports figures, accompanied by humorous commentary from the hosts speculating on the reasons behind their emotional displays.

[00:03:00]  makes no sense yeah and yet he stayed here and she went way up there really comforting for both of  them and that now um she takes a language course she does yes through a series of wacky mishaps  yes it has to say it's an emergency where's the toilet with 40 different languages really  why that's so beautiful though really she does find the toilet i i'll thank god half the time she  does half the time she has to improvise right hats fields whatever she can steins oh that julia  she's charming no matter what she does a hole in the ice in alaska oh god she um she discovers yoga 
[00:03:30]  she goes to meditate uh and she she approaches spirituality with skepticism and then she's won  over isn't she he does i was the first one to start clapping what she really did because i didn't know  if she was going to overcome yeah you had no idea did you oh it was heartbreaking these yoga scenes  and i'm sipping my chamomile tea and i'm lactating and i'm thinking about my vagina and motherhood  yeah and uh then she finally realized what she was supposed to realize yeah i don't want to blow 
[00:04:00]  it for everybody but really it was what happens at the end of the movie i mean i don't want to  spoil it for everybody but does she finally find her true love she really does she goes to india and  she begins traipsing barefoot through the slums and falls in love with the smell of garbage and a man  with one foot it doesn't matter uh if you're missing a foot is that the message that is the message  because she holds up his good one and she goes this is going to go too and then she kisses it  and the film ends she's marvelous did you smell oscar oh greg this is the finest film i've ever  been forced to sit through at gunpoint yeah it really was wonderful all right well you know what 
[00:04:30]  we're going to close things out with the postgame rapper from tv's andy levy yeah and that was  obviously a fucking hilarious thank you obviously a ludicrous review of a film i had not seen  and someone took it seriously on their blog well before she's just why would you take that  seriously what happened to feminism like i guess they were always a little take themselves too  seriously but i would love to get her on the phone her name is us what's her name danny the one who  wrote that not even to yell at her but i really don't want to uh sarah i can't sarah arboleda i would 
[00:05:00]  love to just talk to her and go like how do you not understand that the the comedy whether you  thought it was funny or not that's the subjective thing but it was in the ludicrousness of the  review yeah it was obvious uh a comedy thing it's like uh in the jerk when he goes damn these glasses  son and steve martin points at them and goes okay i damn thee yeah that's a ludicrous thing to happen 
[00:05:30]  it's not ever going to happen yes so maybe steve if he's listening can we look for her yes so what  is she uh right there jimmy i don't have it i have her on the phone from australia she wrote uh  that's long i don't read the whole thing where's the uh part uh can i have it printed out i'll say  i have no desire to read eat pray love when it was a book and i have even less desire to see it now  that it's been made into a film so she has not read it or seen it okay i was content to argue that 
[00:06:00]  my lack of interest was because for whatever reason the film just doesn't appeal to me  but after hearing comedian jim norton's sexist review of the movie i'm beginning to worry that  it has something to do with the stigma attached to lady films especially lady films in which the  lady in question is trying to find herself not just get a man uh and then she goes into her  favorite film of all time is stand by me i would really like to edit this uh and then at the bottom  she bashes a fuck i don't want to just paraphrase because i don't want to rob what she's let me give me 
[00:06:30]  i'll have to read it i can't i can't so we'll have to go back to this i guess uh my favorite  movie of all time is stand by me and while i vehemently argue that it's because the film  is so perfectly encapsulates the moment of childhood right before gender really starts to matter  i also admit that i hated explicitly female counterpart now and then with a passion we already know that  female comedians are absent from the big screen but what about dramatic actresses is that female  protagonists are less interesting or just less interesting films are typically made about them 
[00:07:00]  i know that this is hardly a groundbreaking argument but norton's comments infuriated me  oh if for no other reason than because he seems to suggest that a woman's spiritual journey of  self-discovery is frivolous irresponsible and worst of all boring it is boring it is boring shut it  but what annoys me where we sit but this is again her i don't have the agenda this this chick does  you're fucking around a movie about self-discovery regardless of gender is boring right to me and for 
[00:07:30]  her to assume that it's because it's a what it made her angry as a woman well that's real female  empowerment have a great sense of humor then she goes first there's norton's completely unoriginal  misogyny about the unimportance of a woman's self-discovery and it was like you dummy to think  that that was about a woman's self-discovery being unimportant when i'm making fun of the film i  haven't seen yeah and then she goes into the uh the chamomile tea and the lactating line 
[00:08:00]  yawn we get it women's films are boring oops it was more i'm sorry okay yawn we get it women's  films are boring and they're all about emotions and junk where were the guns where were the nameless  hot chicks and it's like at my house if you only knew the kind of films i almost every film i love  does not have nudity in it you dummy it's like she's she's annoyed about a movie review of a film  a book she has not read a film she has not seen about a comedian that she obviously knows very little 
[00:08:30]  about and she's not doing it in humor she's seriously angry it's like what the fuck that's  fucked up that's and it goes on and i don't want to paraphrase on and on but it's just like that's  what you deal with like what what happened to fucking feminists just annoy me there i've never  met a funny feminist but this is what they are it's like this self-righteous like i did it's uh  hey bob women's self-discovery is not to be ridiculed i'm just getting a kick out of reading your quotes 
[00:09:00]  i just heard it like i just heard it on the clip we played but to read your quotes and then her reacting  to it is simply insanity and then she but then she misquoted me and then there's that wonderful  scene where she vomits gelato and jägermeister into a butter why would she vomit into a butter you  dummy gutters stupid oh my god she said the most appalling of norton's assertions is that roberta's 
[00:09:30]  character based on the novel's author elizabeth gilbert is just a bad irresponsible person trying  to escape from her failure as a woman and then that was the it's important gray because no matter how  bad of a wife you are no matter how horrible of an employee first of all where is the thing about  failure as a woman i say this because she's divorced and unemployed so i'm addressing each point and the  fact that she was a wife well that's because she's a woman but i say employee and how horrible you are  with money those are not gender specific i am making fun of the i'm going i'm answering the question 
[00:10:00]  that greg asked me right uh i wish she was on the can we get her have you heard that or no are you  hearing this now no i'm looking for the name but i said it 10 minutes ago on the air i think you said  it i don't know how to spell it thank you how can we just do it you want me to scroll up so you can  see thank you i said this 10 minutes ago and i didn't say i did yeah right when we later thank you  right when we started the seg the segment yes i've got it now i know but 10 minutes ago we were trying  can we find her i don't know this steve c can't do anything but it's fucking mine it's like when i 
[00:10:30]  say like can we try to get this person on the phone before we do the segment yeah i think i wanted to  talk about it during the break i wanted to give her time to you know again yeah get her shit together  get her get the sleepies out of her eyes and fucking get on our show now here it is hip  steve c do it do it yes momentum killer fucking annoying man he just mosey down the hall and and  to try to find the name of the blogger steve washed his hands and can't do a thing with them 
[00:11:00]  holy shit mind-boggling if he come in and just goes look we can't get it all right that's fine but  he just asked for the spelling 10 minutes into the bit or the segment whatever oh mind-boggling  come on steve i mean there it was a three and a half minute clip that we played and he could have  been in here while we were playing the clip whatever we're just googled the same thing i told 
[00:11:30]  danny to google yes did i do it on the air off the air but you could really kind of find it you could  if you're the producer you can find shit you have to be able to find shit so and that's how you  what's the name i can find a number it's just like you know it's either what's yeah yeah can you find  a number i appreciate that i didn't oh my god let's go to jeff in cleveland jeff hey yeah they  only make these kind of films about self-discovery and spirituality about women maybe make them about 
[00:12:00]  they never make them about guys i couldn't name one that isn't at least a biopic and the reason  why is those are too boring only one would sit through this crap yeah but to imply that it was  based in misogyny instead of just this is a boring concept to me because it's a boring concept  her again her assuming that she knew where i was coming from was being misogynistic is what drives  me fucking crazy so irritated and what's the movie about she eats some good things i don't know  she finds some uh spirituality i don't know any more than she does and a few lovers over there 
[00:12:30]  and that makes her a better person when she comes back to america it's wonderful yeah then it's  fantastic okay if you made the movie anthony bourdain or something then i might watch because  that'd be cynical and funny and wouldn't the movie uh do better if it was a frump in the lead role  instead of uh julie roberts we're supposed to think a hot piece of ass like julie roberts would  have all this shit going wrong she's getting to be from a little long in the tooth yeah  man she's definitely in she's still all right man she's still all right although she has a 
[00:13:00]  witch's nose i gotta admit that fucking perfume stuff killed my throat oh i'm sorry man oh wow  well i didn't spray so that's a drag it just like i feel right at the base of my throat where my nose  and throat like meat oh man it's like um and i drank my water and it had some in it i guess it  had settled all right cool maybe steve will send them out to sell the cologne soon  see are you mad at steve someone's i'm annoyed because to me that's just like come on man you 
[00:13:30]  know we were doing this segment we should have been on this a few minutes ago and if you can't  get her i understand that it's last minute but to only come in at that point and ask does bother me  yeah someone said steve just doesn't know how to call a woman  hey uh we got sierra from ohio wants to say something to jimmy sierra  happy birthday jimmy thank you sierra oh fuck a pill popper love this girl go ahead sir hello druggie  you need to stop um drinking chamomile tea while you're lactating on the toilet if you're drinking

[00:22:30]  and then she's won over isn't she he does i was the first one to start clapping what she really did  because i didn't know she was going to overcome yeah you had no idea did you oh it was heartbreaking  these yoga scenes and i'm sipping my chamomile tea and i'm lactating and i'm thinking about my vagina  and motherhood yeah and then she finally realized what she was supposed to realize yeah i don't want to  blow it for everybody but really it was what happens at the end of the movie i mean i don't  want to spoil it for everybody but does she finally find her true love she really does she goes to india 
[00:23:00]  and she begins traipsing barefoot through the slums and falls in love with the smell of garbage and a  man with one foot oh it doesn't matter uh if you are missing a foot is that the message that is the  message because she holds up his good one she goes this is gonna go too and then she kisses it in the  film and she's marvelous you smell oscar oh greg this is the finest film i've ever been forced to sit  through at gunpoint yeah it really was wonderful all right well you know what we're gonna close 
[00:23:30]  things out with the postgame rapper from tv's andy levy yeah and that's jim norton with a very  funny review of eat pray love thank you and it led to uh sarah writing a whole blog about it uh  why is eat pray love a joke it's sarah arbo arboleda i'm gonna guess is how you say last name later  yeah we got her on the hotline right here uh sarah welcome to the opian anthony show  hi thank you for having me hi now uh jimmy was very confused by your blog we got jim norton  across uh the way from me here yeah it didn't let me let me start sarah by saying it wasn't about 
[00:24:00]  you thinking it was funny or not funny that's a completely subjective opinion so if something  didn't strike you as funny that's you know it is what it is but my question is why the reaction like  what didn't did you not understand that i had not seen this film and it was a ludicrous review  oh no absolutely and actually i was going off of the premise that you had not seen the film  i mean i haven't seen it either and and you know to be fair i did find it funny it was funny 
[00:24:30]  but um no it was going off of the concept that having not seen the film having only seen the  trailers and the and the awful advertising for it that it was coming across as you know just another  one of those silly movies where women find themselves and that was the part i was having  the problem with well i'll be honest i mean that's really not what the intent was it was  just to be ludicrous but a self-discovery i am bored with it and it does focus more on women but 
[00:25:00]  that's even the self-help uh section of a of a bookstore you know there's very little you know  you may have male sexuality by bernie zigerfeld and a few other books but it's all about women's  self-discovery and that whole journey thing kind of bores me at this point  and i agree but i think that i think that there's a special category where you look at  a woman's self-discovery as being somehow less serious or boring or less important because i  would argue and this isn't spoiling the film for anyone but what is inception if not a movie about 
[00:25:30]  two people finding themselves and you know discovering their bad relationships with their  fathers or their kids or their wives or whatever and i kind of feel i mean i feel the same way that  you do um about women's films if i have to see another movie with a 40 year old man in a shitty  marriage with a shitty wife and shitty kids who's miserable and tired and you know he has a bad job  or whatever i'm going to shoot myself but you you all i have to you misunderstood where the point i was  coming from it's almost like because you were looking at i guess from a point of view of feminism 
[00:26:00]  you made my agenda what was actually your agenda which was because you say like first there's norton's  complete like why would my comments infuriate you if you knew it was coming from a silly place  a place of ludicrousness where i had not seen the film and at one point in your review you say but  norton's criticism seems to have almost nothing to do with the film itself that doesn't say to me that  you really knew that i was just being absurd  no i mean i recognize the absurdity of the review obviously the whole thing with the one-legged guy 
[00:26:30]  is it has reached a level of farce that that has nothing to do with the movie um my concern was  more from that that place of it is funny but it's still making fun of that concept of a woman's  journey of self-discovery and i know you're saying it doesn't have anything specifically to do with  women no but that concept of of like you know i was thinking about my vagina and i was thinking about  motherhood and i was lactating and so forth um it suggests that it is it is in some ways partly about 
[00:27:00]  the silliness of of a woman's self-discovery no it was about the silliness of this film it's like  don't you understand that when you start reading into things that are being made fun of and looking  for the greater cause or the greater motive i mean you can find any motive in me that you want to if  you look hard enough and the reality is i'm telling you because i'm the guy that said it i really didn't  know what the movie was about i was kind of going off of greg's questions like when he said to me uh 
[00:27:30]  there's one point where you you say perhaps the most appalling of all this is norton's uh  assertation that robert's character uh is just a bad irresponsible person trying to escape from her  failures as a woman because i said it's important greg because that says no matter how bad of a wife you  are no matter how horrible an employee or how bad you are with money that was just going off of greg's  question because he said this person was divorced um and this person was out of work and this person 
[00:28:00]  so the thing for me was just to be funny and say go on a vacation had nothing to do  with her failing as a woman and it didn't even occur to me  and i i see the fairness in that but then it still doesn't explain the comments about the  lactation and the vagina i'll tell you the car in all honesty they were the same as the comments  about the man with one foot to me that was a funny thing to say to me that was it was a joke to  to think that i was there clapping wildly and lactating because i don't have well female 
[00:28:30]  breasts i kind of have man ones but i conjure up a funny image it's a funny image just like so is  kissing it's like you're accepting the absurdity of kissing a foot in a slum in india and saying  okay this one's going to go next but you're not just accepting accepting it's absurd that i had  was lactating and contemplating being a mother are you saying then that you don't feel that there  were any sexist undertones to what you were saying uh no first of all sexism is just like what does 
[00:29:00]  that even mean in humor i mean why not just say that i was i was classist because i was making fun  of uh poor people in india and then you take it uh take me for task i'm saying go to karachi which was  just an odd place for anyone to want to go on vacation because that's where daniel pearl was  beheaded it's like you're reading into sex and gender issues when i have also attacked cop buddy  movies and made fun of every type of movie it's like you're going into my motives which you were 
[00:29:30]  incorrect about and and i accept that i think that i think my underlying problem is that have you have  you seen the the box office results for it it was probably very good i think the expendables beat  it but i think that uh julia roberts is it is a huge box office draw what should you like i want to  say 30 million something like that i think it did like 22 okay and yeah but but the thing that people 
[00:30:00]  reported on was that the expendables did better than you pray love and and both of them are being called  bad movies um but the expendables did better than you pray love simply because women are more likely  to go with their male partners to go see an action film than male partners are going to go with their  female partners to see something like you pray love possibly and i do not even possibly that's true  well and i do think that in part although your comments are ridiculous and i accept that and i did 
[00:30:30]  find them funny i'm not saying that i sat there you know raging with feminism with rosie the riveter  behind me um but i i will say that i think it i think it does betray a certain underlying thing  of women are less serious or they're boring as as main protagonists no that's honestly it doesn't  betray that at all and if you thought it was funny that's cool but there's nowhere in this review  where you say like oh look i thought it was funny but this this seems like it's coming from a place of 
[00:31:00]  just this really upset and offended me and there's one part where you say about uh instead this seems  like a platform for norton to gripe about the dullness and unimportance of independent female  protagonists i wasn't even thinking of that like i mean it wasn't like i was attacking all women who  are are the leads in films julia roberts is a very good actress i think uh uh meryl streep's a great  actress there's plenty of great actresses uh kathy bates great i mean you know i can go down the list 
[00:31:30]  of people who i think are very talented nothing to do with that it was just to me another drippy  movie i don't want to see it and i don't want to see one about a guy touching his sensitive side and  you when you thought i was like loving the guns and stuff my favorite movies are cuckoo's nest  uh uh you know uh clockwork orange the godfather there's no tits in any of those movies  except maybe clockwork orange or one big nice pair of tits  but the godfather uh well please apollonia for a half a second he didn't even get to touch him 
[00:32:00]  and then she blows up in the car that's not exactly a sexy scene other than to maybe suicide  bombers which would tie in with a little karachi reference but you see it's attitudes like this  that keep more theme films with female leads from being made that's not true what keeps any type of  film from being made is box office that's that's what keeps films from being made and i'm not saying  that that's right but that's what keeps fucking ugly people from getting the leads in romantic  movies too it's the box office oh absolutely and that was the comment that i was making that 
[00:32:30]  because men do not want to go see these movies you have fewer people going to see them women have to  see them alone or see them with their friends and as a result the box office draw is smaller and part of  what my part of what my blog had been about was that i'm uncomfortable with the fact that that is  often my mentality as well that i have no desire to go see this movie i have no desire to go read  this book my favorite movie is stand by me or reservoir dogs all of these male centric films 
[00:33:00]  because they're they're well made and i enjoy them and oftentimes the films with women are sappy  or drippy and it bothers me that i feel this way if i if i see one more movie with um four or yeah hi  with four or five women drinking wine listening to old music and dancing in their living room  uh i will throw up it that to me if i see that in a trailer i get i actually get angry that someone 
[00:33:30]  has done that again and i don't think it has anything to do with being misogynistic it has to  do with me not wanting to see a lousy movie yeah it's not um a sexist uh undertone or anything like  that it just looks like a movie and i i i actually say it aloud to people in the room i go i will never  see that movie uh and it really doesn't have anything to do with some grand scheme of misogynistic  thinking it's it just looks awful and well and i agree i mean that's that is my opinion as well 
[00:34:00]  that i i had to sit through the holiday a couple years back with cameron diaz and kate winslet  sorry i wanted to shoot myself it was awful yeah but if sarah if you're bothered by the same things  obviously that answer said why wouldn't you like where this review came from then if i'm shitting  on a genre that has kind of pegged women as just being this like the fact that i'm mocking that or  mocking the film why wouldn't you go whether or not you think it's funny why would you go oh that's  cool this he's mocking what has become the only thing that's acceptable for women to be the lead in 
[00:34:30]  well because i don't think that that's i don't think that that's true first of all i mean kill  bill obviously did very well great both of them yeah and i and i love them and i mean but i don't  love them because they star women however um what i was going to say was i felt that and and clearly  i was mistaken and i do apologize for putting your words out of context but i felt that the comment 
[00:35:00]  about the vagina the vagina or the uh lactation that it's it again and you know i'm repeating  myself here but that it was suggesting in general especially because you had not seen the movie  that it was just going to be another one of those silly films but i was not to interrupt you but i was  to a certain point in saying that but it wasn't coming from a place of just like you didn't like  kill bill just because it stars women i didn't want to make fun of this movie just because it 
[00:35:30]  was about a woman of course it is about a woman i'm not saying i'm not going to bring that into it  i'd be dishonest not to but that was not this to me was no more make fun of all than say uh what was  the movie about wine oak that you saw with the guys oh god uh sideways yeah like that movie like  if they would have asked me to review that and i knew what it was about i would have mocked it  i had no desire to see that movie actually that was a great movie yeah i've heard it was good  but i really was a good movie my desire to see that wasn't there and you misquoted me on one 
[00:36:00]  thing you said there's a wonderful scene where she vomits gelato and jägermeister into a butter  i said into a gutter because into a butter would be a horrible joke but i actually i stole the quotes  from uh film drunk oh really okay right i i still i link the video i'm still confused i think you  didn't realize that jimmy was just mocking and joking and and having fun with uh the review of the film  no i i mean at the risk of repeating myself again and then sounding sort of if you repeat  yourself again we hang up on you um i i think i understood completely the tenor of the review 
[00:36:30]  what was being said the fact that uh mr norton clearly had not seen it  i i still come back to the word choice that was used and again i understand that oh okay it was a  ridiculous thing because clearly he doesn't have a vagina and he doesn't lactate and he doesn't  drink chamomile tea or do yoga um and these are absurd images but that i i don't know that i still 
[00:37:00]  felt like it was an image of women that women themselves don't want to project and that i'm  aware that it was supposed to be attack on the film i uh i tapped out because quite frankly i was a  little bored by you but um what what do you want from uh films as far as women go what kind of what  kind of movie would you like hollywood to make for women i'm happy i mean i'm happy to see films like  kill bill um i had no desire to see salt uh because it just looks stupid but i don't want i don't want 
[00:37:30]  necessarily women to be portrayed in a lovely way or a fantastic way at all times i want to see more  complex characters and i want to see something like stand by me for women that isn't now and then  which was fucking awful um i want to see movies about women that do not necessarily have to do  all the goddamn time with them being women oh like those uh like uh the traveling pants what was the  name of that one yeah yeah so those type of movies drive you nuts right right because it's always 
[00:38:00]  about your discovery of you know tampons or whatever yeah it is and you know what your  issue is with point is with hollywood and i don't disagree with it but what happens is with feminism  or any type of quote-unquote special interest where they go wrong i think is they begin to take  themselves too seriously and to look for again that greater good or that in in every single thing 
[00:38:30]  like peta members who cannot make fun of animal suffering or uh black panther members that cannot  make fun of or republicans that cannot make fun of uh religion or whatever whatever the cause is  it's like why can't somebody who's a very strong feminist who believes very much in blue is not for  boys pink is not for girls i think a misogynistic joke is funny a misogynistic boss grabbing your ass  is not funny because that's a lifestyle thing but to think that humor makes life a certain way is 
[00:39:00]  completely inaccurate uh comedy is to me taking what we see in life and mocking it it's not it's  not life imitating art it's it's really not that but then you are i mean i will say this like i love  louis ck and he is he is incredibly misogynistic in his humor it's great and what you just said about  how it is often art imitating life well then it is your comments were still a reflection on how  most people see these movies or how most people see this kind of movie well you know what she's uh 
[00:39:30]  you're very similar to us i'm starting to think that you might have just been on the rag that day  when you wrote that blog jesus because i'm serious though because you're you're you're in our wheelhouse  i mean you're like louis and stuff so you're not this over-the-top feminist  no i'm confused by either huh the site isn't supposed to be about that either  i came across that a little bit in this uh this uh particular only in this one because you said  that norton's comments infuriated me and it's like if for no other reason than because he seems to 
[00:40:00]  suggest that a woman's spiritual journey of self-discovery is frivolous irresponsible the  thing is though i was kind of saying the same thing about this movie that you seem to be thinking  another one of these you didn't want to read it you didn't want to see it but because there was a  guy making fun of it and being ludicrous and even having a misogynistic tone in some of the  of course i would have misogynistic tone in certain jokes but that doesn't mean that i'm a misogynist 
[00:40:30]  or i wouldn't make fun of men with the same harshness oh no and and that was the one thing that i regret  that did not come across in that that i was not calling you a sexist but rather that i thought the  comments were sexist and as you've already said they're just reflecting societal attitudes so  just that i mean it is hard and a big part of the other part that i wish had come across a little bit  stronger was that yes i feel this way too and it makes me uncomfortable as a woman i had a feeling 
[00:41:00]  that you'd be cool to talk to on the for some reason it's like i wasn't mad at you i was like  again somebody thinking i'm funny or not thinking i'm funny i totally accept but uh my only suggestion  is you're right well i think you you know it's like i don't whatever your opinions are are cool but  i just wish that feminists because i agree with a lot of what feminism stands for it just seems to  me that as a movement quote unquote or as a thought process or an ideology as things have gotten better  the arguments cannot be like say what they were in 1971 so the focus has shifted to a lot of 
[00:41:30]  harping on people's humor or harping on what people say as jokes or portrayed as it's almost  like it's become about unimportant things and scolding people as opposed to changing what are real  attitudes yeah i agree um and i think that the big focus foci or focuses need to be on the real issues 
[00:42:00]  like the wage gap or or what have you or advertising for women um and i do a lot of i mean in my  other articles i do a lot of work calling bullshit feminists out so this was perhaps a misstep for me  where i was kind of going down the wrong path with being you know the angry feminist because that's  never how you want to kind of come across because you're always going to come across as a zealot  and someone who can't be reasoned with well let me give you a plug on the site because there's a lot  of stuff on the site before that jimmy i think she owes you an apology sarah i think it's only right 
[00:42:30]  agreed all right no i want to hear a nice apology please that's open oh hi i'm making you uncomfortable  sarah can you please apologize to jim norton he's a very sensitive boy well i do apologize it does seem  like i took the comments out of context and and that i clearly have um not offended you but uh but  made it made it seem as though you were something that you were not and you were saying something 
[00:43:00]  that you were not thank you sat it was very nice let me plug this if you were in the office i'd give  you a nice pinch on the heinie that's okay he'd give your fanny a pinch the uh the uh it's one word  it's zeldalily.com z-e-l-d-a-l-i-l-y dot com and where are you you i i was reading the our producer  gave us a little bit of a bio on you and said that you want to go to are you in college now you  want to come to the east coast in the the u.s yeah i'm up in uh i'm up in vancouver bc in canada 
[00:43:30]  okay i'm hoping to come out to the east coast for a grad school all right well it was very nice and  sarah was all right it was nice talking to you sarah all right thank you for having me on all right  take care good job thank you bye all right that was very uncomfortable that was really  uncomfortable apologize it was an apology it's but you know what it's weird though because if  she likes louis ck then i don't even know why she wrote that article when because people have these  weird gut reactions and it's like when i read something about myself sometimes i get very angry 
[00:44:00]  and this didn't make me angry because it was like again i didn't wasn't about me being funny or not  funny but it was like sometimes when you just talk to people a little bit it's not as bad as it  it's always but you know if we just talk things out as a society and the fact that she was how  many things we could overcome well i think i think the problem is what's infuriating when people don't  even get the basics down of what they're writing about yeah you know it was obvious that you were  just goofing and i don't think she realized that until she heard it again before she came on the air 
[00:44:30]  and uh discussed it with you yeah she really thought you're serious i don't know what she  looked she looked like i don't know what she can't find a pic of her huh i don't know i can't find a  picture it doesn't exist yes dan well i think i have her facebook but it's like a group shot so  oh you don't know like any one of which never yeah i'm not her friend so i can't see her other  a lot of girls out there get group shots with their hot friends and then you you just assume that  they're one of the hot i'm just gonna assume that she's probably not good because i noticed that  group shots and animals are usually a big fat slum so when all the girls pictures are animals 
[00:45:00]  when you're when your profile picture is a cat yeah you're a fat ugly bitch  god damn that is so fucking true and look at all of my pictures and there's 22 pictures and there's  like the beach and a cat and fucking a car you're like oh there's not i just see it i just see it  anytime like there's like a new you know friend request that it's just like some dog head or 
[00:45:30]  you know because it works the same for guys too it's not just deny well no no i'll accept it but  then i'll look at the rest of their pictures and go oh of course you know now it makes sense of  course you accept you want all the friends as possible well yeah but you also gotta you gotta  make sure and say because now because you have a bet with yourself that this is going to be some  ugly fat person so now you need to just make sure put them in a special category that's all  all right can we uh i gotta take a break because i want to eat my eggs and ham here  it smells good too they're not even green relatively healthy i want to see what she looks like now she 
[00:46:00]  was actually nice yeah i liked her no i liked her man wouldn't that be interesting if you two kind  of you know got together interesting for me depressing for her she's probably this young hot college  student i'm in my 40s i have a girlfriend yeah that could i want to hang up when i said what kind  of movies you want hollywood to make for women but then i was like you know jimmy's in the middle  of this i can't do that yeah no because she wasn't that was my that was my hang up she didn't she  didn't merit being that crappy she was being nice all right uh quick break her eyes closed oh boy 
[00:46:30]  what is that about well that's a nice picture that means she's got a funny eye which one is she in  this picture then she's got to be the front yeah the front dress hang on she's got to be let's see  she's not the fucking ginger all right let's top this yeah see look because if i go back  hang on yeah yeah uh-huh all right dark hair fair skin very fair skin so sort of an oval  shaped face so then we go to the facebook that's got to be it right there with the frump dress see 
[00:47:00]  oh yeah you put your oh yeah look look she's she's the frump with the big rump let me see  open up the page i can't i'm not a friend i'm not a friend i could do this if you want  you can do that yes she was nice just want to see if she was she yes of course she was nice 
[00:47:30]  but as men um we just want to see what she looks like uh for how shallow we are well not men are  visual everyone knows that yeah that's very we're very good okay let's see um right that is  that her you think it's gotta be she doesn't look like she doesn't look like any of these other ones  um wow who looks like they write for the feminism blog in this picture all right you make a good  point maybe it's just her sticking out from this no it's hard to say i don't know it's probably old 
[00:48:00]  boy haircut what do you think oh boy haircut that dress is atrocious yeah i'd say the dress is  that she probably has a nice little uh chubby hiney under there you like the big uh i do yeah  underneath there that might just not be a good shot of her because that woman in that photo looks  older than like a college age yeah yeah what the hell's going on there i don't know facebook  request her yeah why don't you do that i want to be a friend i don't want to be a friend to a 
[00:48:30]  feminist this is the worst opiate anthony sirius xm  we got big a and stalker patty uh see they're here to talk about their their uh end of one  romance leads into the budding of another one you know what i'm rooting for it's the circle of love  might i say and uh look at that mess sitting out there big a's got a tie on should we talk to him

[01:50:00]  right yes and you have to fight him because you fucked the king's daughter  big a my supper was great you have supper in a carved wooden bowl with that big wooden spoon and it's  it's it's like gruel supper with with big chunks of whatever meat in it like a stew that's supper  that's a retired word we don't use supper on this show dinner we're fancy people dinner would be nice  how was your meal how was your supper what time do you sup supper really creepy all right nathaniel 
[01:50:30]  hi overall how did the date go um it was okay okay i was a little disturbed that big a brought a  friend he brought a friend who uh paul why did he bring a friend well he invited a friend who yeah  why i'm not sure yeah i know needed a chaperone well that was me though yeah if he thought things 
[01:51:00]  we can get out of hand out of hand do we want big a in here yet uh do the mics work and it's all  gonna work i don't know does the handheld work i don't know so he doesn't have to sit and ass up a  seat yeah just have him stand awkwardly yeah you're gonna have to have the official big h chair or  something yeah let's see if the wireless works i got a quick uh another story as we uh get big a in  here so i go down to the san geniro feast right and i'm making my way to paisano and uh they have 
[01:51:30]  a little uh little side road actually i think it was a parking lot and i see world's smallest woman  oh and it was only a dollar person come on worth it and there was like uh uh i'm trying to there was  like how can i explain this there was like uh you're looking at a sign the world's smallest woman okay  and it's only uh hold up like that al pacino scarface poster turn it sideways that's all you 
[01:52:00]  see right yeah it's the size of a poster that you would uh would see on your wall so i pay my two  dollars i go so where's the world's smallest woman i'm thinking i got to walk through this you know  back alley and then behind curtains and stuff yeah it was behind this thing that was as big as a  this poster let's say that you would hang on your wall so you just walked to the other side of it  and there was this little fidget sitting in a tiny tiny little uh couch watching tv and now you're 
[01:52:30]  just staring at her going hey what's up hey freak like you don't know what to say to her was she to  her was she the world's smallest really no man false advertising she was tiny though she was  probably no more than three three feet wow really christ you just sit there so she's just sitting  there with a book and she's watching tv and she's watching friends of all things so now i'm just  staring at her awkwardly i paid my dollar and uh now you're trying to have small talk with the world's 
[01:53:00]  smallest woman small talk very funny but i'm bum so i go hey ah watching friends and she's not saying  anything and that's when like lindsey like pokes me and then points to the sign that says i do not  speak english so now you're like just nodding at the world's smallest woman and and you can't talk  to her and you're just like wow you're really small and wow i feel really awkward and it's probably  good she doesn't speak uh english that's a really bad opening line like hey uh watching friends huh 
[01:53:30]  what else do you say to the world's smallest woman hey what's up there you little shit hey tiny it  seems like a great idea until you uh you're face to face with the the little freak and then you  don't know what to say or do yeah what do you do that's not a safe feeling you want to be with a  mob of other mean people that's what i'm saying throwing shit at her if it was a bunch of us then  yeah we could all secretly be mocking her but one-on-one it's a little weird it's a little weird  see isn't that interesting yeah i mean just like the lines that opie has i mean he'll scream at a baby 
[01:54:00]  they they have they make no sense but a little woman on the couch what was i gonna do and then  she doesn't speak english and then i i'm like i guess i got my dollars worth and i walked away  is that it when you feel you've gotten your dollars worth you leave could you theoretically  just stand there all day and the only reason i'm looking at her is because she was the world's  smallest woman yeah and if we if you could find one smaller there's like a ten thousand dollar bounty  that they will they'll pay yeah i'm sure they will so yeah he'll get that check right to you 
[01:54:30]  yeah sure and then as i'm walking away a guy that obviously was on crack a white a white guy on crack  no teeth comes running up to me with a dart telling me it was for free really first one's free just  like that's how it works but i remember the story you told me anthony so i passed on the dark you pass  on the dark but it's never free i was thinking about you i'm like you'll be paying that's how they  rook you in there they rope you in they give you one they go yeah this is free take a throw and 
[01:55:00]  you throw here you go try another try another come on try another and then uh all those ones that you  tried another right now you gotta pay for right exactly under the guise that they were all free  because he said it was free all right big a's in studio big a why did you bring a friend on your  date with stalker patty uh what uh what friend what friend uh i guess paul  did english paul show up tap tap tap looks like al del vecchio tap tap tap 
[01:55:30]  did you bring uh paul no he wanted to come he's a fan of the show he wanted to come oh i didn't bring  him oh you didn't bring him he just showed up he's trying to cock block you big a you look really  fucked up are you are you hung over today i had like three hours of sleep oh hey 
[01:56:00]  somebody got lucky nice yeah oh wow well we don't want to know how the date ended we got to start  from the beginning here three hours sleep though and you guys were uh drinking the free wine down  there huh yeah joey uh really hooked these guys up at paisano big time and i saw the the crafts of  wine oh yeah brought out and they were they were partaking big time big a a big drinker 
[01:56:30]  not that much no a little bit uh how many glasses of wine would you say you had  oh about three about three yeah had a little buzz on a little bit did patty partake in any wine  oh one glass we'll reveal her drinking oh okay great great very good so where should we start  nathaniel this is your whole thing well i got a lot of audio in front of us what you got there is the  pre-date coaching session uh-huh what's that about uh that's that's e-rock specialty right there 
[01:57:00]  e-rock um what happened it takes a little while go ahead then his mic doesn't work hello there  we're what happened was um intern paul and master po decided to give andrew some coaching  in the ways of love and how to treat a lady oh god and there may or may not have been a microphone  on somewhere in their presence what you have to do is grab it by the throat gentlemen  all right so intern paul who's intern paul do we even know this kid which one's that that's 
[01:57:30]  the one you don't like oh the one from ron a fez yep what could he possibly uh  tell big a whole lot no okay all right let's uh let's get to the audio so master po  talking to andrew about giving patty a rose i guess let's listen in here seriously  if i go to the wherever you go buy a rose actually as you're walking through the streets or whatever  you'll see people with flowers just say patty wait a second i'd like to come back to you in a second 
[01:58:00]  and then present the other rose i got one step better than that oh boy okay no presenter in the  street presenter at the restaurant okay but how is he gonna store it though unless he calls and says you  this is what you're doing um yeah you can do it on the shoot see that's the only thing like he has  to fall in advance or else she's going to know about it you either want to surprise her or you  want to surprise her basically or present her with her right away i think you know as you're walking 
[01:58:30]  into spontaneous things saying hey i'm just thinking about you i'm with you but i'm still thinking about  you let me present you with this oh are you kidding me grab one of those single roses that they sell on  the street i'm thinking about you i'm with you and i'm thinking about you one of those ladies came up  to me as i'm sitting at paisano yeah i was like get away leave go away i don't want your rose that's  gonna last maybe four hours try to guilt you flower for the pretty lady the lady oh she ain't special 
[01:59:00]  enough go fuck yourself all right that's what i say now right after i'm done screaming at her baby  that's right stupid lady with her roses that last four hours i like poe get away from me i have a  better idea and then he just present it to her at the restaurant well how are you gonna get the  flower to the restaurant she's gonna see it all right give it to her in the street the  fuck give her a spinning back fist so you knock her out bring her to the restaurant she won't see 
[01:59:30]  the rose till she regains consciousness all right uh i love it a lot of people very pissed off that  e-rock was able to make it into the studio without his walk-on music by all i am reading instant feedback  from people that are fuming they live it at very pissed off derrick comes up with this great bit  and forgot to play the music today it started yesterday it started yesterday he let him get  away with it he dropped the ball and uh hasn't picked it up all right here's more advice uh that 
[02:00:00]  master poe and this guy paul gave uh andrew for his date with stalker patty my thing is i treated my  ground too too well you don't do that i'm telling you right now you don't do that that's what i did  so she got spoiled and it was more red carpet no opening doors they can open the doors themselves  the only time that you do any of that stuff is when they deserve it it's like the fucking bronze  town she opens the door she's in she opens the door test yeah yeah she opens the door yeah she opens 
[02:00:30]  the door when you come in she'll stab you no no no you open the door for her no you lock with both  carved doors they open up her side and if she reaches around and closes it she's a good one yeah  that's because he doesn't drive it doesn't work so if you take the subway  and the doors don't open and she tries to jimmy the door open for you then you're in  wow it's just the blind leading the blind there is no way to maybe pump some zyklon b into the room 
[02:01:00]  they were talking in and just kill them just gas everybody that was talking and during that  conversation did you hear that yeah they were quoting movies what movie was that from a bronx  tail that's right yeah you you you get in the you you open up the lady's door she gets in the  passenger seat you shut it to be a gentleman and she is supposed to then lean over and unlock your door 
[02:01:30]  and then according to the movie she's a keeper because she you know cares doesn't open the door  he's a selfish piece of right and that's just the tip of the iceberg right exactly very very good  all right all right i think it's a good test yeah more advice uh for uh the big a before his day  with stalker patty i don't think he's prepared so maybe we can raise a little money for him to go  tonight five bucks five if we can all register with me how many people are in for the five fire five 
[02:02:00]  dollar rose and the rest is dinner we'll be good kid get i have faith in you if there's anything left  over and you need it by a couple times so they gave you how much they gave you money for your date  um yes tap tap tap it's not tapping yeah you were a little bit just a little jimmy was here he would  tape your hands down you know that right tap tap i think he taps out in morse code what he's going to 
[02:02:30]  say is that it beep beep beep beep beep yes so they gave you money big a yes how much  um tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap wow tap five bucks  oh you could tap because you're gonna get it out  i don't mean to be an ass i do actually but go ahead i'll stop with all right how much how much 
[02:03:00]  now you're tapping your legs this whole body oh my god that's amazing  can you talk without moving and tapping if you had to try not really holy crap all right how much money  um two twenties two twenties twenties nice forty dollars huh wow all right uh the last of uh 
[02:03:30]  the advice from master poe and intern paul uh did you uh did you think i was with him you all dressed  up today or yeah you look good yeah you look hollywood yeah yeah you look like a movie star  i mean i don't want to be a movie star sometimes you found you always do you feel like uh let's see  burt reynolds burt reynolds which one do you feel like burt reynolds he's kind of old he has one 
[02:04:00]  reference yeah at one time he wasn't but yes he is over the hill jesus master poe great reference  nice reference yeah movie star like burt reynolds pick someone else like jack palance feel like  burt reynolds we feel like jen michael vincent  movie star looks like paul bearer not burt reynolds  look like sean cassidy 
[02:04:30]  huh watch the hardy boys feel sex symbol cover a tiger beat leif garrett you look like brad yikes  oh man well movie star yeah sure i love his frame of reference all right get stalker patty in here  too so we can move on 30 30 year delay oh yeah probably owns like there goes eric ah there  eric's trying to make up now eric's so pissed off because he's really he's usually perfect 
[02:05:00]  yes she is high stalker she's wearing the same shorts she had on yesterday and eric back in the  studio you gotta get a mic uh patty you're wearing the same shorts you had on yesterday so if he wears  the same shirts i don't care oh what it's a jab it's okay for someone to wear the same shirt it's  okay for me to wear the same shorts i only ever have very small wardrobe so i gotta rotate everything 
[02:05:30]  well that means you should have rotated yeah how many shorts everything else is in the wash i only  got about two pairs that i can actually wear two pairs the other one is so short i only wear it to  go to bed at night as a night clothes that's it so you kind of have some uh hoary shorts in your  wardrobe yeah hey patty are you an elf an elf what do you mean by that i'm not three feet tall  look at her ear turn sideways show anthony that's a little elvish a little pointy

[02:06:30]  patty so they must have been listening to the show yeah that's right okay all right well we got audio  of uh the big date and we got them in studio so i guess it started in the cab yeah sort of the  nathaniel going for the taxi cab confession oh nice very good although the video won't look exactly like  that because i'm sitting next to them yeah because we really tried to find a a minivan cab but it was

[02:07:30]  good not very good i was gonna drink at paisanos oh yeah i probably had some wine um patty i'll  probably have the glass of wine what glass just don't think oh i don't really drink a little bit of  wine is not that bad it's okay how many glasses do you think patty before you might be a little less  inhibited well i don't know because uh i have self-control all the time 
[02:08:00]  have you ever gotten drunk before no and i don't expect to either ever ever why not  why because i think people look silly when they're drunk they do crazy stupid things so  isn't that kind of half the fun is you know going out of your comfort zone you can have fun  and still do it right so we knew it was going to be a hot evening sounds like wow off to the right 
[02:08:30]  foot yeah on the right big a's gonna get smashed and she's gonna look at him like he's doing stupid  things very good fun night for everybody so far so good sounds like uh yeah you guys were on your  way he didn't get smashed he was okay yeah he had three glasses of wine or did he have more than  that can have more than others hey he can handle it nice yeah all right let's uh move on more audio

[02:26:00]  heard something happened here should i not say anything yet probably not this is the before all  all right here's the before they got on the first wheel do you think the ferris wheel is going to be  romantic it's gonna be fun big a what do you think about the ferris wheel i think it could be  romantic you know just the two of you up up in the sky hanging out what do you think patty  seemed kind of nice looking down at the world below 
[02:26:30]  she's like a bad movie everything that comes out of her mouth it's like a bad old movie patty's a  romantic stop it she is at heart but she just has this like you know this sex is dirty thing  now the the ferris wheel has always been one of those things that you know the couple goes up and  then you you pay off the guy down below hey stop the car when we get up top and uh wait a little  while and that's the perfect opportunity to you know maybe out 
[02:27:00]  your cock out and say we're not getting down until you suck this  oh what oh like i'm the only one hey you're a romantic too let's let the operator 20 bucks  make sure we get stuck at the top make sure we get stuck at the top  she's gonna suck my cock there's uh horrid you don't want to go to six congratulations  because that's the post ferris wheel six is seven is oh okay we'll go to seven okay we don't know 
[02:27:30]  what happened on the first wheel yet pictures are up on foundry music.com maybe he's and opie  and anthony.com from the big date but here's what happened on the first wheel now they're at paisano  sitting down yeah and they're discussing their little first wheel ferris wheel ride  so you guys just came off the ferris wheel how did that go  all right i was a little nervous i don't think i've ever been on a ferris wheel i was a little 
[02:28:00]  nervous uh what happened when you first got on there um it was rocking a little bit and um  i was a little uncomfortable  with rocking i was a little nervous but the height also so did you and patty get to go together  no i was too big and it wouldn't balance both of us so you guys got to go on the ferris wheel but in 
[02:28:30]  separate cars and we were waving to each other were you all at all embarrassed big a when they  wouldn't let you ride with patty but you got to wave to her this is the saddest story absolutely  that is the saddest thing i've ever heard you could not ride in the same car you really couldn't fit in 
[02:29:00]  the same car those those seats seem pretty big no we could fit in  but they told me  we couldn't drive together and you know what the lack of safety concern these carny  fucking ride assholes have like they don't care the the machine's ready to fall apart at any given  moment anyway yet it was so bad they finally said no you can't go together that's the smell right 
[02:29:30]  there that i'm smelling you just got it yeah it's weird what does it smell like bill it was right  after um uh big a was talking maybe yeah it's just that thing you know when old people have begun  dying but they're still alive like their skin is starting to uh decompose i think that's what it is  big a how's your oral uh hygiene in the morning you brush you bite an old woman's arm  before you do you brush good yes i do what type of uh toothpaste do you use um crest you use crest 
[02:30:00]  you didn't like bury a dead body before you came in here today did you  no i did not what did you eat so far today nothing i nothing i think it's stale breath from drinking  the night before that's all yeah if you didn't eat anything you should go to have that we all get  that yeah you know something positive but they so they couldn't fit on the same first wheel so the  pictures of big a on the first wheel by himself they're up on opiananthony.com it's pretty funny 
[02:30:30]  oh there he goes i'm looking at a picture of him uh when they started up he's waving down  all right that's great so we have more audio now they're at paisano's they're at their table  oh man it's just the creepiest saddest this is just horrific this was their big date starker patty 
[02:31:00]  you had fun on the first wheel yeah looking down at the world yeah the thing is i fear heights so  every time i got to the top i had to shut my eyes because i didn't want to look how high  you got a little oprah there i had to shut my eyes girl let me tell you girlfriend  all right but it was a fun little ride yeah and he won you some stuff with the balloon thing yeah  you must be good at darts big a that's not an easy game to win right yeah you shoot darts 
[02:31:30]  i used to shoot darts yeah yeah now he just shoots people yeah  i know all right so now they're at paisano's they're at their table so let's get into some  of this audio so we can move the fuck on you're at paisano's what do you think of the setting i think  it's very romantic actually patty what do you think very nice very nice by all means don't elaborate um 
[02:32:00]  um so uh you're gonna take over the dinner you're gonna order for the little lady and all that  stuff of course yeah yeah yeah i will do you like that do you want to be a take charge kind of guy  oh well you could i could tell him what i want he can order it  she will have the linguine and white clam sauce  how you gotta do it it's big a though two cokes no i 
[02:32:30]  she will have  hey rat no matter where you are make it seem like that's the place to be  isn't this great  i'm happy for you kids yeah i really am nathaniel's showing his uh comedy chops there 
[02:33:00]  that's why you're gonna kick harry's ass by that whole sarcastic i love the sarcastic humor he has  absolutely love it uh so at this point was there any romance was there any hand holding  any sparks they call that anything you click in you two anything did you feel anything different  than you try to grab her thigh under the table anything like that playing footsie  um no were you thinking about it though big a come on thinking about making a move  i'm trying to hug her but she's always pulling away why are you pulling away patty it's a hug 
[02:33:30]  i know but it's a hug well i don't want to say it i got more action say it what was the problem  there's a slight breath problem so i kind of like  i don't want to say anything i'm very tactful i just could okay all right people we'll see you 
[02:34:00]  monday morning at 7 a.m live here it's the opium anthony show why would you discreetly tell him  last night when you could tell him now in front of national radio you are no i don't say anything  i just keep my mouth shut so and he should too apparently so what the problem was with the  hugging that was the only thing you know was you would have hugged him more if uh his breath was  better yeah big a did has anyone ever told you now obviously it's something you don't want to hear 
[02:34:30]  or anything but has anyone ever told you that maybe you have a problem  um yes i use uh you know the listerine um when was the last time you went to a dentist  it's all about the dental floss by the way when did you go to this rotting food in between  the teeth that causes the bad breath but when was the last time brush the tongue brush the tongue 
[02:35:00]  yeah that's with one of those things you're supposed to scrub your back when was the last  time you were at a dentist anthony once enough yeah yeah um a couple years a couple of years or a few  years couple is two if if you're saying two that means it's probably three or four right i'm thinking  six years since you've been to a dentist yeah let's be honest here today shows about honesty today  last century was it was it still the 1900s patty's wearing sweet honesty so let's be honest 
[02:35:30]  yeah all right here we go anything six years  was it 1900s or 2000s who was president good yeah that leaves you a big window it wasn't two years  was it no yeah it was a while how long ago you don't remember yeah which bush was an office  no alexander haig 
[02:36:00]  well we're gonna have to do something about that you know because you know you're a nice guy  uh his appearance last night was great you know they had this uh shirt and the tie and everything  like yeah i thought the uh the way he dressed up i thought that was great yeah right did the hair up  and everything he was all showered all nice but then see what happens and uh big a don't feel bad  because if you watch tv and you see all the products that are available and all the uh people on the um 
[02:36:30]  on the toothpaste commercials always talking about it it's a widespread problem so you know it's nothing  to be embarrassed about the worst thing is doing nothing about it at all so what we got to do  is uh maybe uh haul your ass upstairs uh to the dentist and have them maybe poke around a little  bit in there and see if you got some issues maybe you got some what they call uh some of that decay  you know it's like uh when your teeth start rotten you got any toothaches do you get toothaches 
[02:37:00]  no no no all right let me let me go to chris in wisconsin he has a quick comment go ahead chris  oh jesus guys make it stop it's worse than the poker chip this is so fucking uncomfortable  we understand it's uncomfortable it's almost like an intervention though interventions are not  comfortable things yes something had to be said it's better something is said now 
[02:37:30]  and we take care of it then it just keeps going right you gotta agree that's right right patty what  do you think sure shut up so so he was trying to hug you patty and uh you you didn't want it because  of the breath you know what it was like it was like watching uh peppy lepew cartoon he's there trying  to paw at the cat and she's constantly trying to get away because that green cloud  comes over please give me a kiss 
[02:38:00]  all right so where was he trying to hug you around the vagina no where in uh the fair where were you  on the street on the yeah i think we were like uh on the street walking a couple times and stuff and  they tried to hug you and you backed off yeah like get a little bit intimidated by that is it 
[02:38:30]  true he took master poe's advice though and bought the flower but it wilted when he said here he didn't  i didn't get a flower no no oh no that didn't happen come on bill this is fun oh phil's horrified  i was talking last night i was talking with my girlfriend last night and i was saying bill is so much  different than what this show is about yeah like he fits in perfectly and i don't know why  because his whole thing he's like such a nice guy yeah and we are such scumbags such despicable 
[02:39:00]  pieces are we get off on this stuff and and bill is like you know no i can't i oh my god but he fits  perfectly and and he caves to peer pressure whoever just called in this is just like yeah and stop the  bleeding already see no but that's what it shows about is furrowing we bleed them out  until there's no blood no we we keep going how bad is his breath uh stalker patty 
[02:39:30]  see even i don't think there's a reason to go there well well we just want to know if you don't go to a  dentist then quite well what does it smell like like how i don't know i can't describe it  yeah and i can't i'm not good at the scraping smells like hot hot garbage sizzling and hot garbage  no just like oh thank you auto and george just like a very subtle thing you know i guess all  right yeah well now now the gloves the gloves are coming off now uh big a well did was there something 
[02:40:00]  about patty that you didn't like maybe annoyed you a little bit you gotta fight back big a she said  you had really bad breath i didn't say that like she winced every time i touched her  no you weren't wincing no no all right why don't we get to some more of this audio then there was  some hand-holding though as they walked down well there was yeah all right very good here's  there we go i'm trying to sell some ray of light here's uh you guys are playing with fire you realize 
[02:40:30]  this man could squeeze any one of us i do understand that you're right big a you feel a  little bit yeah you're right yeah you're hanging in there i know it's just feeling a little badly  i think are you because of this yeah well who does it because you don't like hearing this stuff  why but in the end you got to realize something big a in the end this is a good thing for you  we're going to take care of a problem i say uh we uh funnel some of that money away from the 
[02:41:00]  katrina victims he's got his game face on right now i don't know if you've noticed yeah i say yeah  and uh maybe i get you a little dental uh uh help there because that's all you need you go up to a  dentist well do you ever see those makeover shows so amazing what they do and uh they'll uh fix your  mouth up and uh no more uh breath problems and then patty will be right in your arms there you go  yeah all right here we go hoses from the car wash there's a water pit here's the here's the lovely

Here comes Professor Anthony.  You know a little bit about everything.  Oh, thank you.  It's just a wasted childhood in front of a lot of Warner Brothers cartoons.  All right.  Big A looking for a Lady and the Tramp moment.  Nathaniel, do you want to explain this before we play the audio? 
[02:49:30]  Well, we were toying with the idea of getting that nice photo.  Look at Patty's face.  I don't.  Where there's a noodle, and we don't know what's happening in the middle of the plate,  but as they eat it, it gets closer and closer, and they're sharing the same noodle.  And maybe they touch mouths.  Right?  We all remember the scene.  That's just wonderful.  That's adorable.  And Big A would nose over a meatball, and it would be romantic.  Yeah.  Remember in the movie, the dog takes his nose and pushes the meatball over to the girl 
[02:50:00]  dog, and she's all happy?  In this case, Patty would nose over some mouthwash.  No.  So how did that work out?  Why would you do that, Patty?  She explains.  Oh, she explains on the tape?  Yeah.  On the tape.  Listen to me.  I'm pulled back another century.  On the tape.  Big A brings it up, and she reacts.  All right?  What are you proposing, Big A? 
[02:50:30]  It's the Delight Lady and the Tramp, but I can't do that.  And why not?  Because I'm not like that with food.  I mean, I think it could be a very cute picture.  Yeah.  No.  I don't really want to do that.  You don't have to kiss, Patty.  You could just...  No.  No. 
[02:51:00]  I can't.  I'm sorry.  No.  We'll put a Krusty the Clown mask on you.  No.  No, I don't want to eat out of somebody's mouth.  I can't do that.  Yeah, I don't want to get out of somebody's mouth, Patty.  That's what they were doing in the film.  Patty, I will be...  I will have my half, you have your half.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, that's...  It can't do that.  No. 
[02:51:30]  I'm sorry.  But...  Big A's got to get some props for trying to close the deal.  Oh, yeah.  Without a doubt.  You're aggressive.  I like that.  But now, Patty, didn't you understand that they didn't want you to do exactly like the  movie if you didn't want to and go right up to the end?  It would amount to...  No.  ...one piece of spaghetti, one end in your mouth, one end in his mouth, and then you could...  It's yucky.  ...then you could spit it out.  Oh, that skeeves.  But it's not touching...  You stupid fuck!  Are you listening to me?  I am.  It's like...  It's like taking a string, putting one end in your mouth, one end in someone else's 
[02:52:00]  mouth.  How is that affecting you?  It skeeves me.  I'm sorry.  How does it skee...  But you're not even eating it.  It's the same piece of food.  Ew.  No, I want...  It doesn't have electricity in it, though.  It's not going to get...  Ew.  Germs.  No.  I'm a germaphobe.  I'm like that.  But there's no germs crawling.  They're not like an army marching across the fucking bridge over the river Kwai into your mouth.  What the fuck are you...  It's just...  And then you spit it out for the picture.  No.  No. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, my God.  I want...  I'm like...  I can't.  Hold me back.  Hold me back.  I want to kill her.  I'm sorry.  I can't deal with that.  Sorry.  I get very sensitive with the skee factor, you know, like...  Germs and stuff like that.  I'm like very...  All right.  What about kissing?  Do you kiss people on the mouth?  You're not dealing with food that you're eating, you know?  I'm the type that sanitizes machines, you know, and stuff.  You sanitize machines? 
[02:53:00]  Just walking around, you do that?  What do you...  No.  When I used to sell coffee at the place, I would flush it with hot water five times every morning  to get rid of the taste of the coffee from the day before so that it was coming out fresh  coffee.  You know, that's how I am.  That's where you want to go for the coffee.  No shit.  For the fucking lunatics.  Let me go to Tom in New Hampshire.  Go ahead, Tom.  Yeah.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Tom.  Good morning, you red-headed bastard, you.  Oh.  Hey.  How are you?  Warming up to you. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Hey, this morning I was flicking the TV around eating breakfast.  I came across of Mice and Men with John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.  Yeah.  Right at the scene when they were in the barn and John Malkovich was touching the girl  and she didn't want him to and she started to scream.  He jumped up, grabbed her, and broke her neck by accident.  And I was thinking that's probably the way this date was going to end, but I see she  made it home alive.  So, you, well, okay.  Thank you, Tom.  Sorry.  Sometimes I get so excited because, like, it says on the screen, Tom, they should have 
[02:54:00]  discussed Mice and Men.  Of Mice and Men, of course.  Of Mice and Men.  I'm thinking, wow, what a great phone call to go to.  It'll be quick, fast, nice.  And then he just goes all over the road and finally gets to the point and it's...  Yeah, how about that hurricane?  Right.  Wait, what the fuck?  Help us out.  All right.  We only have two clips left.  I like this.  Patty didn't want to do the Lady and the Tramp thing with the spaghetti.  It's too bad. 
[02:54:30]  You would have enjoyed that, right, Big A?  Of course.  Of course.  The meal is very good.  The company is even better.  Good food, a great company.  How's the company for you, Patty?  Very good.  What have you guys been talking about?  This and that.  Little things, you know.  What were we talking about? 
[02:55:00]  It must be the wine.  How much wine have you had here?  Oh, three quarters of a glass.  Wow.  Three quarters.  None.  I was just staring at it.  The aroma.  Three quarters.  Oh, wow.  You're a lush.  Which to me is a lot.  Yeah.  Are you starting to feel tipsy?  No. 
[02:55:30]  Starting to feel like I could use some nice cappuccino.  Oh.  Bring me back down to Earth.  How about you, Big A?  How are you feeling?  I'm feeling all right.  Not bad.  I had about two glasses of wine, but I feel a little right.  Wow.  This is just so exciting.  It's not Big A's fault, though.  He's been trying to make it happen.  He's staying positive.  I gave a lot of props to Big A today. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  He's working it.  You could tell he's had a little bit of wine, so he's loosened up a little.  He's willing to take some risks, some chances.  Good food.  Company's even better.  Right.  Good line.  Right.  And then Patty's sitting there.  You want to build his self-esteem back up from the ashes?  Three quarters of a glass of wine in her.  All right.  And she needs something to bring her back to Earth.  Good luck.  Jesus.  A cappuccino.  I had a Red Bull. 
[02:56:30]  I'd love to see her on a Red Bull.  A Red Bull and vodka.  It's wonderful.  It doesn't have any effect on me.  I drank a can of Red Bull.  It doesn't make me hyper.  No?  No.  Can't believe that.  All right.  Here's the date wrap-up.  Ah, the wrap-up.  Everyone is wondering, will there be a second date?  Well.  Nathaniel, man, we don't pay you enough.  I just realized that.  Yeah, spread the word.  Spread the word.  How awful was this to you?  Um, it was... 
[02:57:00]  I just hope I can log the hours.  Let's put it that way.  All right, Patty.  So, you're finished with your evening.  How's it...  How'd it go?  How'd the date go?  It was a lovely evening.  And I enjoyed it.  Yeah, it was very nice.  It was very nice.  The meal was wonderful.  The company was wonderful.  We had a very good time.  Okay.  Actually, same as Patty, um, the meal was great. 
[02:57:30]  Um, and hanging out with Patty was very nice.  We got to know each other a little better, and we, you know, found out information about  each other, and I think it went very well.  What's the most interesting thing you found out about Patty?  Uh, that she's afraid of heights.  I am. 
[02:58:00]  And what'd you find out about Big A?  Um, he has fun on the Ferris wheel.  He won me a nice stuffed animal.  I didn't have a seal, so now I do.  So, as it is right now, will there be a second date, Patty?  Sure, I could, you know, we could, you know, have fun together.  Yeah, I enjoy his company.  Big A?  There's definitely a second date with somebody, you know, if you were thinking about either 
[02:58:30]  the, you know, either comedy cellar, bowling, or doing something together.  All right, wow.  I like, after a two-hour long date, uh, dinner, Patty has learned that Big A likes the Ferris  wheel.  I was, my mind went blank.  Yeah, that happens, doesn't it?  We can relate to that. 
[02:59:00]  And, uh, but you'll go bowling or something, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Because I like to bowl.  So, these guys walked past me, um, after their dinner at Paisano's.  Yeah, we were-  You were holding hands.  Ooh.  Was that fake, or was that real?  Um, what happened?  Uh, she was too drunk.  Oh, nice.  No, we were just on our way to, uh, the, uh, go down to the village, you know, to the  red line from there, and, uh- 
[02:59:30]  Soak his cock?  No.  But you were holding hands?  Yeah, we-  Yeah, we-  They-  They-  They-  I guess, I don't know, I guess maybe-  I don't know, it was where you told-  You know, I don't know, maybe to just look-  Did you grab her hand there, Starger Patty?  Uh, uh, Big A?  Yes, I did.  And she had no problem, uh, holding onto your hand.  That's kind of cool, right?  And then you went-  Then you went and saw, uh, 2U, Anthony's brother's, uh, band.  That does a great job at the U2 thing.  Where were you tonight? 
[03:00:00]  The Kit Kat Club?  And I guess we got it, uh, I don't know.  What happened at the end of the night, I guess?  U2's over.  Yeah.  Then what?  What happens?  How does this completely end?  How do you part ways?  Where is it?  What happens?  I called his friend that he works for at the cab, and they came and got us and made sure  I was safely to my door.  So you got to your, uh, uh, apartment-  Yeah.  Building.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  And did, uh, Big A get out of the car to escort you to the door?  They wanted to, but I told them, it's not necessary.  The door's right there, and the doorman's right inside.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  So I went up by myself.  Now, Patty.  Yeah.  You know what that means.  You know what you, the signal you threw out there.  No.  We know exactly why you didn't want to have him walk you to the door.  Because that's, that's a, uh, because that, that means you didn't want to kiss. 
[03:01:00]  As Big Kev nods off in the corner, Bill's just looking at him, looking at points, and  I'm like, look at him.  Uh, that wasn't on my mind.  I was just, you know, the doorman's right there.  There's no need to escort me up the stairs.  Don't you understand?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You don't understand.  It's not that there's no need.  There's probably never a need for the guy to walk the girl to the door.  It's part of the dating ritual. 
[03:01:30]  It's how it ends.  The bitch could certainly walk herself.  Right, but there's that, there's the walk to the door, then there's, because that's  the private moment, that you get to say, I had a great evening, and maybe we can do  this again.  Right.  Uh, have a good night, and then the kiss comes, and, uh.  Yeah, Big Kev, were you pissed, you know?  Were you a little pissed?  You whined, you dined.  Right.  Um, a little bit.  A little bit. 
[03:02:00]  There you go.  A little disappointed.  Yeah, sorry.  Because the whole date.  You should be, right?  You win her a, you win her a, uh, fucking seal.  Right?  Right.  We're not asking for the balloon nut.  Throw a couple drinks down the throat?  Yeah.  And, and.  Can't even walk him to the door?  Jesus.  Sorry, I didn't know that was part of things.  You want the, uh, you want the, uh, the ending of the date, you know, because that's  on his mind the whole time.  Right.  You get the, you get the little kiss in, and then Stark Patty, you go, hey, would you like  to come in for a nightcap?  You want to come up for a cup of coffee? 
[03:02:30]  And then you sit him down.  I made some beer in the bathtub.  This prohibition is cool.  He sits down on the couch.  You get, uh, you go into another room and get into something more comfortable.  I got some corn squeezins.  Maybe some old.  You want to come up for a shot?  Maybe some old-fashioned lingerie, you know.  Why don't you sit out here while I put on something a little more cute for you, the  toad bull?  And then you come out in your other pair of shorts that look just like those pair of 
[03:03:00]  shorts.  That's all you own.  Just say, head over to a speakeasy.  I know the piss word.  And then next thing you know, you're bumping uglies.  Right.  That's how it works.  Well, it's only the first date.  Well.  No.  All right.  So there was no goodbye kiss.  Not even a goodbye.  He tried.  Did you say that you were going to get out?  Did you attempt to get out?  What happened? 
[03:03:30]  Um, I asked her, are you sure?  She says, yes, I am.  Oh, I thought they were just concerned for my safety.  No, how about, how about she gets out?  Why did you ask?  Why not just get out of the car with her?  As she gets out, you follow her and, and, and go to a door.  Tackle her into some shrubs.  There are no shrubs in my building.  You didn't, uh, you shouldn't ask.  You don't ask.  Well, in Big A's defense, he had been getting negative signs all evening. 
[03:04:00]  I don't doubt it.  Might have been a little timid.  And he kept the tone real positive.  Yeah, you did.  Yes.  He did everything he could, but there was, uh, no romance at the end of the night, huh?  All right.  Wow.  Stalker Patty, um, would you go out with Big A?  Yes, as a friend.  As a friend.  Yeah, do fun things together.  All right, Stalker Patty, uh, turn to Big A and tell him you just want to be friends.  You know, just want to be, you know, friends. 
[03:04:30]  I like your company.  I like people, you know, I like, you know, I'm always doing things alone.  I like to do things with other people.  It's more fun that way.  So there'll never be a kiss at the door?  I don't know.  Never say never.  You don't know.  I don't know what the future is.  No, but you just want to be friends.  You got to cut her out.  Right now, this moment.  Don't take her calls.  She's just going to use you, man.  Yeah.  No.  It's dinner.  Yeah.  Big A, what do you have to say to that?  What do you have to say to the fact that you spent all that time?  Fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh. 
[03:05:00]  What do you, say something to Stalker Patty.  Turn to her and, uh, and, uh, respond to that.  Don't be afraid, man.  Let the anger go.  Get the anger out.  You're allowed.  You're allowed, man.  This is.  Fucking pissed, man.  I'm pissed for you.  Yeah, come on.  Strangler.  Do us all a favor.  Jesus.  I can't do that.  All right.  Of course not.  Just, uh, you know, let her know. 
[03:05:30]  Let her know.  Right now.  Yeah.  About how you feel about the friendship thing.  You're talking for a lot of guys out there right now.  That's true.  We've all gotten the friend speech.  Yep.  Why can't we be more than friends?  It's still too early.  I got to get to know you better.  You know, I'm not, I don't, I'm not that fast with me.  Everything has to happen slowly, you know. 
[03:06:00]  You know, first you go through the friend stage and then, you know, if anything's gonna  happen, there's little upshoots from there, you know.  Upshoots.  That's how it happens.  I think it just progresses naturally.  Sweet.  Go ahead, big A.  Okay.  Come on, big A.  Do it.  Do it.  How'd it go?  Tap into the tower how you feel.  Come on.  Come to the dark side. 
[03:06:30]  That's right.  Be honest.  Go ahead, big A.  This is your moment.  Don't let us guys down.  There's a lot of us counting on you right now.  They're out there.  Fuck you, bitch.  Yeah!  Hey!  Big A!  Big A!  Throwing down the gauntlet!  There you go. 
[03:07:00]  You leave with your fucking manhood intact.  Good man.  There you go.  Woo!  Big A!  Yeah!  Big A, you turned a major corner.  I'm proud of you.  Holy shit.  Oh, nice.  That's right.  That's how you do it.  That is fantastic.  All right, play the walking away music, Anthony.  Sorry.  That's it, man.  It's over.  One and done.  Feel good, don't you, big A, huh? 
[03:07:30]  Got a little jolt when you said it?  Yeah, that was good.  We'll set you up with a whore.  Don't worry.  We just saved a random stranger from getting strangled.  Right.  All right.  Stalker Patty, any final words about this whole thing?  I'm sorry.  I'm just not that fast of a person.  Fast.  I gotta go slow.  Slow.  You didn't let him walk me to the door.  The fucking hurricane moves faster than you.  Well, I didn't know that's what you were supposed to do.  I thought it was only a safety factor, and I was perfectly safe.  Oh, stop it, Dee.  They were watching me.  If you knew anything about dating. 
[03:08:00]  You know.  You know, it's because you don't know anything about dating.  Big A.  You know, they were watching me as I went up there to make sure I was okay, and I was  appreciated.  Just when people, this wasn't going anywhere.  All right.  Well, that's that.  That's, you should have, you should have, I don't know.  Big A, you made my day.  That's right.  All right.  Patty, leave.  Both of you.  And Big A, final words here?  Sorry.  Any final words?  Don't fuck it up, man.  Just walk on that.  Yeah, you don't need to, you don't need to say anything.  You said it all, Big A. 
[03:08:30]  You need no follow-up.  You don't need to say shit.  Walk out of the studio with their head held high.  That's so we don't have to smell your breath.  Oh, God.  Oh, stop it.  Look at those shorts.  Wow.  There they go.  There's potential, but it's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Wow.  Oh.  That was quite an hour of radio.  Wow. 
[03:09:00]  I'm stunned.  But Big A, pulling it out at the end like that.  Fuck you, bitch.  I think he even, he didn't even make those noises.  He just said it.  He just blurted it out.  You don't want to hear that just friend speech.  Oh, people are screaming on the instant feedback, going way to go and all that.  All night long.  It just gets frustrating after a while.  Hanging out with Patty, thinking maybe, maybe at the end of the night, something.  A kiss.  That was like that hacky moment in all those police academy movies.  Don't move, dirt bag. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  And then the crowd erupts.  What?  Woo!  Yeah!  He did it.  And Big A's thinking, Jesus, it's bad enough that I have to go out with twos, but now I have  to go out with a two that's a prude?  That wants it to be a friend?  On what planet does that happen?  Horrendous.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Live on the Today Show, there's some genetic disaster.  I don't know why.  Oh, poor kid.  Our kids are changing the lives of some pretty special kids. 
[03:10:00]  Special.  It's a place where we celebrate ability, not disability.  Some fun characters.  Others come just for the fun.  Alicia De Noon is in remission now.  She had a brain tumor when she was three.  All right, you know what?  I'm turning off you.  Oh, God.  I didn't want to be tempted.  Why?  She's in remission.  That's good.  I didn't want to be tempted.  The cute girl petting a dolphin down there in Florida.  Got a better brain tumor.  God bless her.  Let it be. 
[03:10:30]  Look at that little swimsuit on her.  Thanks, Mom, for that nice genetic handoff.  A brain tumor at three.  Here you go.  Can't be harmful.  Yeah, must have been my smoking, Mom.  Let that three-year-old get a brain tumor front.  From Mom doing dope.  Nice smile.  Here's a softball on your brain stem, kid.  Get headaches until you're 40.  Oh, Jesus.  It is cruel, and there is no God, and I don't want to hear an argument about it.  What did this kid do to deserve a softball tumor? 
[03:11:00]  A brain tumor.  Brain tumor.  In her little head.  And now she gets to pet a dolphin.  Swim with a dolphin.  Hits him with that bottlenose right in the tumor.  The dolphin can smell the sickness.  Whatever dolphin noises they make.  Tries to beach the kid.  You kill it.  Yeah.  So it doesn't...  I smell the sickness on you.  We must beach you.  The kid has no clue that she's...  I beach you.  There's a ring around the head.  Whatever that thing is. 
[03:11:30]  I'm a yeast dolphin.  She's not sure if she's petting a dolphin or a goat.  Take it to a petting zoo, for God's sake.  Mommy, why is the goat in water?  Shh.  It's all right, Puddin' Head.  It's a dolphin.  Puddin' Head.  Oh, is that horrible?  Puddin' Head.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny. 
[03:12:00]  That's very good.  Ah.  Ah.  Children and their families that needed this.  Woo-hoo!  Fifteen years later, Dina's Island Dolphin Care is the largest non-profit program of its kind.  Recently, they moved into a $2 million facility.  Oh, nice.  A museum of sorts.  And take pride in reds.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  That was a nice picture.  It would be funny if you get a little shirt for the kids.  I went to the dolphin farm, and all I got was this lousy gene pool. 
[03:12:30]  There you go.  I'm going to swim with the dolphin.  Okay, dear.  Be back later.  Be back later.  Why do dolphins get pegged with these jobs these days?  You think the dolphins sit in there like, oh, Jesus.  Why can't it be that hot stripper blonde that's on vacation with the other ladies from Hooters?  I used to strap mines to my head, and I'd put them to enemy boats. 
[03:13:00]  Right.  Now I've got to play with this special child.  He's drooling on me.  Oh.  I remember this.  Isn't this the theme to Flipper?  They call him Flipper.  Flipper.  Swimming with retard.  That one you see is smarter than me.  Smarter than me.  Not the kids he's swimming with. 
[03:13:30]  Balancing their heads on his nose because he thinks it's a big, dumb ball.  Oh, Jesus.  This is nice music.  Trixie will do.  Trixie will do.  Children are near.  Tries to jump over his big head, but it's too big.  Crashes into the ear and falls back. 
[03:14:00]  Sneaks under and bites the kid's foot for making him look fat.  The dolphin almost dies because the kid's big tongue gets stuck in his blowhole.  I can't breathe, kid.  Dolphin.  Puppy.  Pitten.  Yeah, right.  Okay.  That's why the dolphin's jumping out of the water. 
[03:14:30]  He's just saying, get me away from this retard.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, that's mean.  Yeah, that's really mean.  They're trying to do something nice, and we're mocking it.  I don't mean it.  That's horrible.  That's why there's a three-month wait to swim with the dolphins.  Is there really?  You can't get close to the dolphins anymore.  Where?  Here?  It's all the rage down there in Florida.  It is all the rage.  People love swimming with dolphins.  You go to that, you're on vacation, you go to the resort there, and you try to sign up  for the dolphin excursion. 
[03:15:00]  Ah, that's booked six months in advance.  I'm not saying it's inconvenient to have that in your family, but I know that there's  some parents trying to start it, but instead of a dolphin, it's a shark.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Swim with the shark.  Swim with the, it's a dolphin, honey.  Yeah, pet this, you photograph ruiner.  You guys, we got a quickie.  It's only a minute and 15 seconds.  Saw a friend of mine, Dally Dooley, once. 
[03:15:30]  Thought he was sleeping.  Gave him a nudge, and his tongue was bitten in two.  Still plenty of it for three men, though.  Let's drink to the dumb look on your face.  Here's to swimming with Down Syndrome, women.  Sharks in the water.  Retard goes in the water.  I'll retard.  Farewell and ado to your brain-damaged child. 
[03:16:00]  I'll educate him, but it's going to take $10,000.  So we need a rocking chair once, not the shark, the kid.  Uh, boys, you're going to need a bigger hat. 
[03:16:30]  Very good.  Look out.  There it comes.  I'm Chrissy.  Yes, well, you know, we're all going to hell, of course.  Instant feedback, like people are telling us anything new.  That's horrific.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony's Sirius XM. 
[03:17:00]  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole!  You guys, stop!  Sirius XM.  Hey, uh, another home invasion.  Oh, God.  This one's a good one, though.  This is a fun home invasion.  Are they ever really fun?  Let's see.  A cheerleading squad breaks into your house, takes off everybody's clothing, including their own,  and does their routine, and then leaves you feeling happily completed at the end of their home invasion. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, cheerleading squad coming in and having a panty party.  That would be a fun home invasion.  Panty party!  Jimmy, would you like to give another example of a home invasion?  That would be a good home invasion.  That would be a good one.  Panty party!  A good home invasion would be if someone broke in, right, because they had all these freshly baked cookies  they didn't know what to do with, and they broke in and they held you and your family hostage 
[03:18:00]  and made you eat chocolate chip cookies, even though you were trying to cut back for the holidays.  And they took your garbage out because they hated it being there.  Left pleasantly, quietly with your garbage.  Exactly.  That's a good home invasion.  That would be a great home invasion.  I hear about those.  I'm going to say that...  This one, on the scale of cookies, what do you think?  I'm going to protect myself.  Possibly a good home invasion, right?  All right.  Possibly. 
[03:18:30]  The more I read about this one, it could go either way.  Here we go.  An 18-year-old in Ahwatukee is accused of breaking into someone's house, looking at pornographic pictures on their computer,  then taking dirty pictures of himself on their cell phone.  His explanation to police?  I'm a pervert.  Best story of the day, at least.  Could be story of the month.  That is a good one.  I'm a pervert.  Hey, being honest with you. 
[03:19:00]  What do you want from me?  I love the news guy has to be serious through the whole thing.  An 18-year-old in Ahwatukee is accused of breaking into someone's house, looking at pornographic pictures on their computer,  then taking dirty pictures of himself on their cell phone.  His explanation to police?  I'm a pervert.  The second we figured it out, I thought I was going to vomit.  She was sleeping when Phoenix police say...  She was sleeping when Phoenix police say Alani Hazard broke into the house. 
[03:19:30]  John Montone.  This guy really said, she...  She was sleeping.  She was sleeping.  He just interrupts what she said.  Okay, he was probably there when they were producing the piece.  Okay, fade her down here and I'll come in with my VO.  She was sleeping.  Good job, good job.  Yeah, good job.  Could you extend the she a little bit more, though, because we have to get the commercial.  She was sleeping. 
[03:20:00]  You probably had to start ahead of the microphone like, she was sleeping.  Sam.  She was fast asleep, Sam.  And he came in and took photos with his phone.  She couldn't roll over on her stomach.  She was stuck on her back because of a flat ass, Sam.  Her ass looks like it was taken off by a deli slicer, Sam.  So what happened? 
[03:20:30]  Gypsy.  Gypsy.  I love Gypsy.  I have a bunch of bad sweaters with collars.  And I'm always getting involved in, like, these mysterious chases.  Yeah.  It's just a creepy corner.  And then you could be at, like, the bar hanging out.  Every woman I have sex with has hair and toenails growing and that's it.  I sleep with all the cold bodies that come through.  You sleep with the dead.  Of course I do.  A little Gypsy.  Gypsy.  Stupid Robert Edo walks in in his homoerotic white coat with a little hole cut in the back.  Free the access.  I despise Sam. 
[03:21:00]  I don't know what's going to happen to Robert Edo.  We died alone and screaming.  Alone.  What an idiot.  You're an idiot.  There's more on the Gypsy.  The pervert.  We figured it out.  I thought I was going to vomit.  She was sleeping when Phoenix police say 18-year-old Ryan Houghton broke into her Ahwatukee house through an unlocked back door, 
[03:21:30]  took dirty pictures of himself on her roommate's cell phone,  then looked at pornography on her roommate's computer.  Sickening.  I remember feeling very nauseous.  All right.  We get it.  Jeez.  Upset your tummy.  I thought I was going to vomit.  It was sickening.  I felt nauseous.  Mighty.  Act like you've never almost been raped before.  Oh, wow. 
[03:22:00]  Another roommate wasn't home when it happened, but heard about the burglar with the bizarre fetish later.  I was just shocked that somebody would actually come into our house and do that.  The girls found evidence someone had used the computer the next morning.  Yes.  It was all over the keyboard.  Good work, detective.  Somebody spilled white jam on the XT. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, my keyboard smells like pennies and bleach.  What happened?  The screen is filled up with M's because the M key is stuck.  Here the next morning.  And the cell phone, too.  He made a dirty picture of himself.  The cell phone's wallpaper.  He wanted a phone. 
[03:23:00]  He wanted a car.  He really wanted that to be seen.  I got a question for Jimmy.  You think this guy likes porn?  This guy doesn't even watch porn occasionally.  This guy loves it.  I love the fact that he makes his bag her cell phone picture.  The wallpaper on her cell phone.  No matter who calls her, she has to see that.  By the way.  And then he hung wallpaper with what he left all over the keyboard.  People are saying, why didn't we say this for Perp News Thursday? 
[03:23:30]  It was too good to say.  Yeah.  Cell phone's wallpaper.  He wanted us to know.  He wanted to get caught.  We could totally tell.  Otherwise, he wouldn't have left all those things behind him.  But police say what he left behind at this house on the streets of Ahwatukee helped detectives catch him.  But not before these girls learned an important lesson.  We're vulnerable anywhere we are.  That's the lesson you learned?  Ahwatukee has confessed to this.  They say when they asked him why he did it, that's when he said, quote, I'm a pervert.  He's now facing burglary charges as well as voyeurism charges. 
[03:24:00]  How did she learn that lesson so late in life?  What kind of sheltered existence does she have?  No care.  We're vulnerable.  Really?  Wow.  And Santa's not real.  Thought she could just walk around.  I thought there was fairy dust sprinkled on me.  My father told me when I was three that he sprinkled fairy dust on me.  The guardian angel.  That guy is, uh, he's funny though.  Oh yeah.  You know what he did?  Because there's not much you can put on a cell phone wallpaper. 
[03:24:30]  Like you wouldn't do a full, um, a full length thing.  You can't hold the camera out that bad.  So you know it was just exactly, yeah.  It was exactly that that was on her cell phone.  She probably picked it up and just went, oh.  Well, she probably thought it was eel sushi.  Who took a picture of an eel and put it on my phone?  It looks like the Loch Ness Monster and he's drooling half and half.  Wait a minute. 
[03:25:00]  There's a fleshy shoulder stole.  Oh my God.  Yeah, we got a smart one here, huh?  Win it, win it, win it, boo.  That's it for the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, gentlemen, another show.  Well done.  I knew what to expect.  A douche chill moment.  And boy, did you deliver.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern on The Virus. 
[03:25:30]  And check this out.  You're listening to The Vibras.  Oh my God.  On Sirius XM.  Good morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  So, kind of embarrassed that we're playing that shock jock intro as Buzz Aldrin makes his way to the Opie and Anthony Show.  I know.  Right off the bat, we're going to be interviewing Buzz Aldrin.  He's got, what, a new film out?  Fly Me to the Moon, right?  Wow, there he is. 
[03:26:00]  An American hero.  Coming into the Opie and Anthony.  Special couch.  Steve made him sit on the couch.  He was going, Steve, he can sit where he wants.  We just thought you'd be comfortable on the couch, Mr. Aldrin.  No.  What'd he say?  I was ganging up on him.  He's Bose?  No.  No Bose?  What do we got?  We got garbage headphones for Buzz Aldrin?  Triple A battery.  Yeah.  You need a triple A battery?  Yeah, you know, the Bose headset. 
[03:26:30]  Right, right.  Oh, those things are great.  Push the button to turn it red.  Those are great.  Those are awesome.  You get on a plane, you don't have to listen.  Yeah.  You have them for travel?  You don't have to listen to people and noise.  Hey, you're coming up pretty clear, yeah.  Yeah.  How loud was that Apollo 11 taking off?  That'd be pretty loud, right?  We didn't hear it all that much.  Really?  No, we had a headset on and we're upstairs.  Anytime you watch dramatizations of it, like on films, because I like, what'd you think 
[03:27:00]  of Apollo 13, the film, Ron Howard's film?  It was a made-for-story drama.  Oh, really?  You knew what the outcome was, but it was a little exciting.  Yeah.  But the thing is, the launch always, it seems very violent in movies.  Was it like that?  Were you really shaken up?  Movies make it look violent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the name of the game. 
[03:27:30]  You gotta shake, rattle, and roll.  You guys know that.  Over-dramatize a little bit.  But was it a shaky ride going up?  There's a difference of opinion, depending on who you talk to.  I thought it was quite smooth.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, and I look at the films of people in the shuttle, where it's shaking all around.  And I didn't see anything like that.  Really?  Because it's all relative, yeah.  Because he's a man's man.  If it was Jimmy, he would say, yeah, it was shaking like an earthquake. 
[03:28:00]  The argument that I put forth is that the three of us agreed, in some little conversation  that we had, that we felt, at the instant of liftoff, that we were no longer attached  to the ground.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Now, that's a pretty sensitive feel, as if the rockets were, you know, gimbling a little  bit to keep a signed course.  Well, if you look at the film, slow motion of that rocket going up, and see the rocket 
[03:28:30]  bells, they're not moving a fraction of an inch.  No.  But anyway, we had that sensation.  Now, if you were shaking like this, you could never come to that conclusion.  Right.  That the moment of liftoff was just really imperceptible, and it was so smooth that you felt like there  was a little steering of the rocket going on.  That's amazing.  Buzz, what determined who...  Why do I put a hole in this damn thing?  Steve, please, take some coffee. 
[03:29:00]  Stop bothering him.  Steve.  You just want me to help him?  No, why would he?  He went to the moon.  He doesn't need some help.  He doesn't need Steve helping.  I'll help get your coffee cup open.  You ever felt like you're a help to death?  Yeah.  It's like, all right, I think he can handle it.  He said, that's all right, big boy.  Buzz, what determined...  With the panted extremities. 
[03:29:30]  What determined which one of the three of you went actually first?  Was there anything that...  I mean, was it because...  Was Neil considered the mission leader, or what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Were you ever tempted to just go out of the hell with it and kind of bump him out of the way?  I'm a military guy.  You know, I know how to take orders.  That's what you learn the first couple days being a plebe.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  We like to think you did rock, paper, scissors to see who went first.  Now, when I listen back to some of the historical tapes and stuff, there was a little problem with the landing, as far as finding a spot to land. 
[03:30:00]  And as time goes on now, you realize how critical that was.  What were you guys thinking when, apparently, Neil Armstrong and yourself were trying to find a landing spot for this thing, running out of fuel quickly? 
[03:30:30]  Well, a computer was doing its job.  It was going to land itself.  But nobody wanted to let the computer land in the wrong spot.  Right.  It couldn't see all the little craters here and there.  Right, right.  Rocks.  They cut you down, then you tip over.  So, it was sort of an accepted agreement among all the commanders that they were going to manually take over at 500 feet. 
[03:31:00]  Now, when I say manually take over, that means you're steering the autopilot.  You're giving it kind of additional instructions as to what to do and how to steer it.  And then it smooths things out and digests them.  So, you can take over and get the feel, the response, and then sort of guide it to where you want to go.  And we practiced in helicopters doing this. 
[03:31:30]  And then we had a monstrous trainer called LLTV, Lunar Landing Training Vehicle.  It was a research vehicle at first, and they didn't research it all that well.  Oh, is that the one?  Several guys had to bail out of it.  Deject out, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It didn't have wings.  Yeah.  And so, if the engine quit or something new, it's come down.  Yeah, yeah.  Or if it lost control. 
[03:32:00]  So, you guys had barely any fuel left when you touched down?  Was it that close?  Yeah, well, early spacecraft are always a little heavier than later ones.  And a heavier one requires more fuel to change its velocity and movement.  So, it's consuming more fuel as it comes on down to make a landing.  And probably, we were nominally scheduled to have maybe a minute and a half, maybe two minutes of fuel left at the normal time of touchdown. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, but we were clearly a little bit long from the starting point.  And if it's long, that means you're burning fuel longer, and time is fuel being used.  Sure.  So, we were going to be consuming automatically a little bit more.  And then, what Neil saw, he sort of re-designated to a little longer place.  And then, with something in front of you that you don't want to land at, there are kind of four things you can do as you're coming down like this. 
[03:33:00]  If you want to land short, you've got to pitch up to slow down, and you'll have to lose sight of where you're going.  And if you want to land to the left, you go this way, and then you've got to do this way.  And it's kind of drastic either way.  The best thing to do is just nose forward and fly over and then land over here.  That takes longer, conserves more fuel. 
[03:33:30]  You guys talking to each other during this point and calling out fuel?  Or is there...  Well...  Are you going, hey...  The gauge wasn't all that good.  It had a light on it.  Oh, God.  It's like an old Pontiac.  It's a little better than that.  Well, yeah, a little better.  A light on it, so...  At a calculated 60 seconds of fuel remaining.  And then the guys on the ground could watch much closer the digital readouts being radioed back. 
[03:34:00]  And so they called out 60 seconds to let us know that that's how much time we had.  We were still 100 feet in the air.  Oh, wow.  No, that's wrong.  We weren't in the air.  Yeah, you were above the surface.  Wow.  What were you thinking as you come down?  I mean, you're landing on the moon.  What's kind of going through your head as you're the first people to ever do this?  We're not really conscious of what's going through our head. 
[03:34:30]  We're responding sort of automatically as if you're in a helicopter or a lunar landing training vehicle.  As long as it looks okay, you keep going with what's okay.  You're all right.  If it doesn't look okay, then you start doing something about it.  So you're not dreaming or conscious of what's going through your head.  Just doing your job at that point, I would gather. 
[03:35:00]  When did it hit you then?  You're right.  You're probably looking at all the facts and making sure everything is working.  When did it actually hit you like, wow, I'm on the moon?  When did that emotion hit you as opposed to just the facts of doing what you were doing?  All the way.  You're always conscious of what it is you're doing.  And when there's nothing left to do, then you can relax.  And when we shut the engine off, when I saw the light come on, which means contact with the surface,  there are about six-foot probes extending down from the landing gear pad. 
[03:35:30]  And obviously when you land, those are going to be bent sideways.  And it throws a micro switch, which turns the light on in the cockpit saying that you have just touched the ground.  So when that happens, you shut the engine off.  So in case Neil didn't see the light and is concentrating, why I called out contact light, engine stop, and a few other things.  So you could very easily touch down, and the computer may not really know that you touched down. 
[03:36:00]  It just knows that something unusual is happening, and it's maybe not in the last attitude that it was supposed to be.  So it's going to fire thrusters to get it in the right attitude, but it can't do that because it's on the ground.  Even though you're on the ground, right.  So you've got to tell it, I'm on the ground, and you tap the controller to do that.  You understand that.  Actually, yeah, kind of do. 
[03:36:30]  Was there a point while you guys were on the moon and Michael Collins is in the ship,  was there a point where you get nervous, like, all right, well, Michael Collins is up there waiting for us, but what if he screws up?  Was there any fear of getting stranded?  I mean, that's kind of where my head probably would have been at.  Was there like a little thought that something goes wrong?  There are planning thoughts where you're conscious of what's going on, but not during the act.  It's a little late to be worried about things like that. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, I'm feeling like you're there.  I guess I'm treating it like it's a family vacation instead of a military mission.  Yeah.  And the, yeah, because I was wondering about the booster that takes you back up now to the command module.  You know, you're wondering if that's going to fire at some point.  That has to cross your mind.  You don't want it to fire until you want it to fire.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, you don't want to be walking around and watch it take off, that's for sure.  But you also do want it to fire when you're in there ready to leave. 
[03:37:30]  That had to cross your mind, too, at some point.  No.  No?  That's amazing.  Engineering faith.  Engineering faith.  Faith and Grumman.  That's amazing.  That is amazing.  Out the road a piece.  Yep.  There's a museum out there somewhere, Cradle of Aviation.  Yeah, I'm looking to get them involved in a 40th anniversary next April for two combined missions, 
[03:38:00]  because they were pretty close together, of Apollo 9 and 10, because they both involved the lunar module.  Apollo 9 was in Earth orbit, the first flight of the landing craft in Apollo 10.  We took the lander on the dress rehearsal to the moon.  So, I want to have a reunion of the guys involved at about that time.  Have you ever heard of Yuri's Night?  Yuri's Night?  No.  You know who Yuri is?  I would guess, yeah, Yuri, what's his last name? 
[03:38:30]  Gagarin.  Gagarin, right.  Yeah.  Well, some neat kids felt that the U.S. needed to lead the world in celebrating the first guy  who went into orbit.  Yuri Gagarin.  Now, I don't know why the U.S. has to celebrate somebody else that we were in a race with.  So, anyway, there's kind of a social event, April 12th, every year, called Yuri's Night. 
[03:39:00]  Well, after a while, I kind of resent this.  You know, we don't have a Shepard's Night.  Right.  Remember, Al Shepard or a Glenn Night.  Glenn gets enough credit these days, anyway.  He wants to keep flying the shuttle.  Yeah.  So, I'm trying to put forth a change to that and making it Yuri Aljohn's Night.  Yuri Aljohn.  That's kind of hard there.  Yeah, yeah.  Roll off the tongue.  The, uh, uh, I, I obviously know about your, um, your love for the skeptics that, uh, suggest 
[03:39:30]  that, uh, of course, none of this ever happened.  Um.  Well, I am a skeptic.  I, well, I would.  I'm a skeptic of Al Gore.  I think we all are, in a way.  Uh, the, the skeptics that, that, uh, say that this never happened, um, uh, I can't  even believe that they, uh, come out with stuff like this, but you obviously have been 
[03:40:00]  outspoken.  Why, why do you, uh, why are you interested in it?  Because it's controversy.  That's what your shows are built on.  Hey, what's, uh, what's wrong with this?  What's wrong with that?  Let's fix it right now.  I can't stand those people because, uh, it's, it's, it's denial.  It's some kind of a.  What to do is ignore.  Ignore.  Uh, you're just feeding into their, their routine.  Well, I kind of remember one guy you didn't quite ignore, but that was nice.  I hate to say this, but I would hate to be taken in by a bunch of crackpots and enhance 
[03:40:30]  their purposes by, uh, uh, feeding into their business of calling attention to them.  That's what, that's what they want.  Well, I got to tell you, when, when, when you kind of popped that guy, I was very proud.  That was a proud moment right there.  What are you pointing at there, boss?  A little bit of a wreck.  It's a hazardous world here.  It's a hazardous world.  Hey, you know what's going on in about 45 minutes?  What's that?  Quietly, stealthily, the moon is going to get between the sun and the earth. 
[03:41:00]  It's called an eclipse.  An eclipse.  Yeah.  That's happening today?  Today.  Today.  Today.  And it's visible, uh, where?  Seven, uh.  Is it visible here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the, on the TV set.  On TV?  Yeah.  Uh, no, it kind of, kind of sweeps across, uh, Asia, uh, Canada, North America, and, and  on into Russia.  Uh.  Where it's kind of dark.  And there was a time when I thought, well, I think I'll go to Russia and look at this 
[03:41:30]  thing, and Lois said, no, that's not too good an idea.  And somebody invited me up to, uh, uh, simulated Mars, uh, location in Canada.  It's called Devon Island, where there's a crater, and, uh, a lot of things there look  as if you're, uh, maybe on the Martian surface.  So NASA and other people are using that as sort of a simulated training place, and they  have a, uh, a habitat that's landed, and there are a bunch of guys that go up there in 
[03:42:00]  the summer, and, uh, they kind of camp out, uh, for a while.  You've been a strong advocate of, uh, going to Mars.  I've read, uh, some of your stuff in Popular Mechanics.  Yeah, we need to do that, uh, in a deliberate way.  Mm-hmm.  Popular Mechanics, yeah, I'm having dinner with those guys tonight.  Yeah.  But, uh, they did a nice story, uh, oh, about a year and a half ago, on, uh, a concept that  I came up with just trying to improve and admire people who are able to bring about change. 
[03:42:30]  When, uh, Kennedy said, on May 25th, I believe that this nation should commit itself to landing  a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.  We like that last part of the phrase.  But, but, anyway, did we know how to get to the moon, really, at that point?  No.  Well, we, uh, had just had Alan Shepard go up and come down.  Mm-hmm.  Suborbital, you know, Richard Branson-type stuff.  Not even in the space, like Gary Gagarin. 
[03:43:00]  That's a far cry from...  Gary Gagarin went one orbit.  Yeah.  And then he, uh, uh, opened a hatch and bailed out.  Uh, um, the, the world didn't know that he jumped out of his spacecraft.  Because in order to actually qualify for the, uh, uh, the awards, uh, the FAA or the, the  French, uh, equivalent of awards for achievements in aviation, you gotta stay with the craft  all the way till it touches town. 
[03:43:30]  You don't abandon it.  Uh, so, they, they were a little quiet.  The Russians were about announcing that, uh, on the way down, uh, he, he didn't want to  land with, with the craft.  Yeah.  Uh, so he opened a hatch and jumped out and used a parachute.  Wow.  Really?  Basically a girl who abandoned ship.  Well, those, the Russians, they didn't, uh, they didn't splash down, you know, hit the  ground.  All right.  So, so what I was saying was that, uh, uh, um, we didn't really know how to get to the 
[03:44:00]  moon.  We had a mercury with one person in it and we knew that going to the moon, it was going  to take more than that.  So we just automatically filled the gap between those two programs with a program called, uh,  Gemini.  And that's what NASA people call it.  The astronomers call it Gemini.  Uh, but you know, NASA people have to be different.  So when, when I explained something about the, the Gemini program, uh, I, I'm always conscious  that, uh, is the guy going to know what I'm talking about? 
[03:44:30]  Gemini, Gemini.  Uh, but anyway, it's a two man program and it was just smooth and natural as could be,  uh, in contrast to what's, what went on after the Apollo program and what's going on today.  Now, when Kennedy said, we're going to go to the moon, do we know how to get there?  Well, sorta.  We had a big giant rock rocket on paper while we were building the Saturn five or designing  it.  Uh, there was an even bigger rocket.  And if we'd gone that way to go to the moon direct, turn around and come back, we probably 
[03:45:00]  wouldn't have made it, uh, until 1975 or something like that.  Then there was a Saturn five.  We could use two of them and join things up in earth orbit and then go to the moon land,  come back.  Uh, and Wernher von Braun was in favor of that.  Uh, it used his rocket twice and the science advisor to the president thought that's, that's  the way to do it.  And then there was this, uh, engineer, uh, at Langley, uh, NASA Langley said, wait a minute, 
[03:45:30]  I think there's a better way to do that.  We can use only one Saturn five.  Man, that, that's pretty good idea.  But we have two spacecraft and we're going to send those two spacecraft to the moon.  When they get to the moon, uh, two guys are going to get in one of them.  They're going to land.  The other guy's going to stay there.  Uh, and then when they get through, uh, kicking up dust on the surface, they're going to get  back in again and they got to join up with the other craft.  Uh, that ain't easy to do. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Especially a quarter of a million miles away.  Uh, but a bodacious plan called lunar orbit rendezvous was proposed.  And, uh, and around 1961, 1962, after Kennedy committed us to go to the moon, that's what  we decided to do.  Uh, and Von Braun went along with the idea.  So did other people.  And Gemini was pretty much a practice for docking.  So the point I'm making is that when we decided to do something, we really didn't, but we were 
[03:46:30]  flexible back then.  We were adjustable, uh, after we finished Apollo, we, we had a Skylab mission that used  Apollo stuff, but we still had almost six years when no American went into space.  We had a gap between when we stopped doing one thing and you start doing the next one.  Uh, we didn't have that in, uh, uh, after Sputnik between Mercury and Apollo.  And we were flexible early, but we were not flexible when we, when we started designing 
[03:47:00]  the shuttle.  Uh, we made a mistake by, uh, thinking we could put two crew members in the booster rocket  and they were necessary.  I objected to that, but not loud enough.  And that was a stupid thing for NASA to do.  Uh, but we were, NASA was not flexible then to look at the best way to go from the Apollo  program to the shuttle program.  We, we had another, uh, uh, Skylab and it's in the Smithsonian. 
[03:47:30]  Why the hell didn't we fly it and join it up with the first Skylab?  Man, that would have been an even bigger space station that we could have flown people to  it, we could cram six people in an Apollo command module.  We could have done that all through the seventies into the eighties, but we didn't.  So why, why didn't they?  Nobody was smart enough then.  That's what I'm saying, that we were not flexible enough to look at alternative things.  Now that leads us to today, right today, after, uh, we lost the Columbia accident, lost, 
[03:48:00]  uh, three guys coming back in, seven guys coming back into land.  Um, we, we only had three left.  We had to do something probably now the, uh, that's, uh, in, in 2003, the beginning of  that first February president, the president's got a reelection coming up.  Maybe he could just kind of sit tight and do, do nothing.  Don't do anything controversial with an election year coming up. 
[03:48:30]  Is that what happened?  No.  Uh, he, he had his people study during the year 2003 so that at the beginning of a crucial  second term election for reelection, first term went to the Supreme court.  What did he do?  He made change, change.  Okay.  Billion dollars of change program in, uh, terminating the shuttle, uh, finishing the space station  and going to the moon again.  Mm-hmm.  That's what we did.  Nobody gives him credit for doing that. 
[03:49:00]  That was the vision that came out, uh, at the beginning of 2004.  Okay.  As we have, uh, we, NASA has wanted to implement this program.  We got a gap.  We're going to stop flying the orbiter in 2010.  And when is the next spacecraft, Orion, that's going to take people to the moon, uh, and bring  them back, uh, that won't be ready until 2015 or beyond.  We got a gap.  Five years, yeah.  Have we fixed the gap? 
[03:49:30]  No.  Are we flexible about re-examining what we're doing?  No.  We need to do that.  That's our problem today.  Mm-hmm.  It's my problem to try and be a catalyst to, to, to look at the different options.  Utilize that five years.  We got, uh, uh, an election coming along and two guys are going to replace the president  that put in motion, uh, going back to the moon and, and on to Mars.  And, uh, we don't know what either one of them is going to do, but I'm going to try and  provide them with a team of, uh, very expert people, uh, some of the options that they could, 
[03:50:00]  uh, they could pick.  Yeah.  That would be, uh, uh, good to, to maybe utilize that five years to do some more research,  uh, and not just, uh, uh, sit there and not, uh, we, we, we can't just sit there.  We've got a hundred billion dollars in space stations sitting up there and our guys want  to go up there.  You know how we're going to have to get up there right now?  Russians.  We're going to have to hitch a ride with the Russians.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And, uh, we can come up with a capsule and land in the ocean after 25 years of seeing our 
[03:50:30]  astronauts come back and land on the runway.  Why, why aren't we developing a spacecraft smaller, much smaller than the shuttle that  can take, I don't know why.  NASA has studied something like that for over eight years and then they put it on the shelf.  And you don't know why?  Uh, well, I, I suspect that, uh, that they don't like that kind of a, uh, spacecraft.  It, it somehow, uh, brings into question their decision to use a capsule coming back from 
[03:51:00]  the moon.  Mm-hmm.  And they don't like Air Force rockets.  No?  Well, it's, apparently, because, uh, there are two very, very good rockets that could be  used in addition to, uh, deriving things from what the shuttle, uh, is launched by, uh, rockets  and, uh, certain engines.  We could preserve that, uh, take the orbiter off and, uh, and put something on the side and  make minimum change and use that for the cargo but put the people on, uh, on top of, uh, Air 
[03:51:30]  Force rocket that, uh, that already exists.  That, uh, that's not all.  There's a lot of details involved in, in these decisions, but we're not being flexible, I don't  believe, in reconsidering before it's too late.  If you're proceeding down a course, and clearly, a lot of people are beginning to question  whether that course, like Yogi Berra says, uh, when there's a fork in the road, take it. 
[03:52:00]  Okay?  Uh, I, I like Yogi, because when I moved out of Montclair, New Jersey, he moved in.  I have a question, too.  It's a little, it's a different subject, but, uh, Dr. Uh, Edgar Mitchell, I think his name  is, has been in the news a lot the last few days, um, talking about extraterrestrial  and how NASA's covering it up, and NASA's being very nice about it, but they're saying,  well, we, we disagree with him.  I mean, do you, do you know, I'm sure you do know him, and what's your, what's your 
[03:52:30]  take on it, or your little, he's getting a lot of attention.  Why?  Is his proposition normal?  No, it's a little bit bizarre.  Uh, people love to pay attention to bizarre things, especially if they involve cover-up and  conspiracy, and that, that really attracts attention.  You didn't go to the moon?  Oh, yeah, yeah, you were doing that in a backstage lot in Arizona or something. 
[03:53:00]  People pay attention to that.  That's what they want.  I don't, I don't know what Ed's, uh, uh, motives are particularly.  Uh, maybe he does have an inside track to intelligent sources who, who claim this and  that.  Well, so do all the UFO claimers.  They have an inside track to information that we don't know about.  Um, and, and, and it makes them feel important.  Uh, uh, anybody who says we got a conspiracy going, how are you going to deny a conspiracy? 
[03:53:30]  You got to prove everything, uh, that, that, that isn't, uh, uh, what they claim.  Yeah.  Well, what do you think, Buzz?  Is there aliens out there?  I, I, are we alone?  Well, maybe, we don't know.  There is no evidence that says there exists life anywhere else in the universe.  Ah, is that probable?  No.  It's very, very probable that you're given the right conditions around, uh, uh, billions  and billions of suns, there's bound to be life that, that will generate itself just 
[03:54:00]  naturally, just like it did, uh, here in, uh, our solar system, uh, on, on the planet  Earth.  It, it doesn't seem so remarkable a thing.  But there's no evidence.  Now, we call ourselves intelligent, so out of, uh, out of all that life that was teeming  around the dinosaurs and everything, things interrupted.  The little, little big rocks hit the Earth, and, um, uh, unfortunately, the dinosaurs didn't 
[03:54:30]  have a space program, so they couldn't stop the, uh, the, the thing from coming in and  hitting the Earth.  Um, you know, so it gave, uh, rise to, uh, uh, it was okay for the apes to begin to come  down from the trees, and they started walking around, and certain branches, uh, uh, got,  got smart enough to dig in the Earth and found some funny stuff that if they, uh, got  it hot enough, it melted, and they could make that into metal and, and get wires and, 
[03:55:00]  uh, uh, create radios.  And pretty soon, they put, uh, put together an automobile, a train, an airplane, a spacecraft,  a rocket, and went to the moon.  That's intelligence.  That's pretty amazing.  I think it is.  Yeah.  What do you think of technology today?  Um, obviously, you've seen a lot of, uh, a lot of technology over the years.  What do you think, uh, uh, is it being used wisely?  Um, things like the Internet, uh, with the, the, the way to communicate, uh, with anyone  in the world at a moment's notice. 
[03:55:30]  Mind-boggling, isn't it?  Mm-hmm.  You used to know what was underneath the hood of a car.  You used to go in and change this thing and that thing.  You lift up the hood now, and, geez, everything's computer-controlled, and you can't squeeze much  of anything in there.  Mm-hmm.  And you got to take it to somebody else to fix, fix what's going on.  Yeah.  There's no backyard, uh, little, uh, uh, auto repair shop.  Um, and it's amazing.  I, I, I got two cell phones.  Yeah.  Two Blackberries.  Uh, and, and the new one's coming out in six months or whatever. 
[03:56:00]  Uh, and, and that's a rapid pace of, of innovation that's going on in production.  And, uh, we, we don't send something back to the repair shop.  We throw it away and got a new one when it comes out, new.  It ain't that way with rockets.  It takes a long time to develop a rocket engine and put it through the testing that's needed  to get the kind of reliability that we want, that you would want, to climb on top of that 
[03:56:30]  rocket and, uh, and, and light the fuse.  Most of us in the space program don't really like the word blast off.  It's a little bit too violent to be like liftoff.  Hey guys, we got to get Buzz out of here cause he's, you're doing a good morning America or  you're going to do some TV, right?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Which one?  Cause I mean, our listeners.  A few more minutes?  Okay.  A few more minutes?  Okay, good, good, good.  Okay, good.  Hey, we got an eclipse coming up in 30 minutes, but, you know. 
[03:57:00]  Wherever, we have to go to Asia.  Do you have any, what, what, do you have any motion sickness?  I read that there was one of the astronauts that had motion sickness from the time he left  and the other guy just laughed at him cause he was vomiting the entire trip.  Did you have any, any motion sickness or anybody you with?  If you're sitting in a, in a combined, uh, uh, uh, uh, geez, what am I trying to say?  A crowded condition and, and you got three guys there and one guy begins to vomit.  You're not going to laugh.  You're going to help clean up what's going on. 
[03:57:30]  And besides that, if, if, if you're in route to the moon, somebody who's kind of sick, you  don't want to turn around and come back.  So you tend to downplay what was happening and, uh, yeah, roughly 50% people sense some  uneasiness, uh, from dizziness, uh, uh, maybe a little, uh, lack of, uh, orientation to,  to, uh, actual churning feeling in your stomach to nausea to vomiting there. 
[03:58:00]  Uh, and this happens in maybe about 50% of people.  And, uh, in the early, uh, minutes, hours, day or two of space flight.  And it's been a, it's been a concern, uh, not everybody, uh, but, but once, and, and  it gets kind of complicated and I have my theory about it.  I clearly, I think that it's visual and psychological.  You can sit in a widescreen theater. 
[03:58:30]  Okay.  And see a scene of rollercoaster.  Right, right.  And you feel it in your gut.  Yeah.  How do you explain that?  It's truly, that's pure visual.  You know, nothing's going on.  You're, you're not churning up your inner ear, your vestibular, uh, this and that.  Uh, so, so, uh, uh, we, we don't have the right answer yet.  And, and I have some theories about it, uh, about people who have a good sense of direction  down here, uh, uh, as opposed to some people that don't have a good sense of direction. 
[03:59:00]  Those of us that don't have a good sense of direction, we're kind of continually confused  when, uh, when something changes.  So, when you get into orbit for some reason, uh, your reference is taken away from you.  Uh, so, the person who is kind of egocentric, it gets lost down here, uh, up there, it's okay.  You know, sure, it's a little different.  But the guy who has a great sense of direction, he just lost something that's pretty, pretty 
[03:59:30]  significant to him.  And so, he's going to evolve, develop a sensory conflict.  And humans with a sensory conflict, uh, get, uh, nauseous for some reason.  And if it's sufficiently, uh, disturbing, we vomit.  What is the closest thing to the feeling that people just normally on Earth can relate to?  Is it like a boat?  Is it like when you're just, you're going between the Earth and the Moon. 
[04:00:00]  Now you're, you're cruising.  Uh, what, what does that feel like?  Is it a rocking motion?  Do you, I know that you're, you're pretty much weightless, but.  There's no, uh, there's no up and down.  Right, right.  Uh, when you're at the Earth and we're, and we're oriented with the gravity, uh, that's down.  Right.  Uh, but when you kind of move away, Buckminster Fuller said, we need to start thinking in terms of  outward and inward.  We're moving outward, away from the gravity of, of the Earth. 
[04:00:30]  Uh, and, and that's the sense that you have when you move away and, and the Earth is back  there and the Moon's over here and the Sun's over there.  And we're, we're, we're, uh, they're, they're all about in the same plane because of, uh, the,  the orbital motion of the Earth and the, and the Moon.  Uh, and we need to be perpendicular to that plane rotating to even out the heat from the  Sun and also to keep communication back to Earth.  So, uh, you're sitting inside of this thing and, and, and, uh, uh, it's moving and the, 
[04:01:00]  the Earth moves by in front of your window and you watch it.  And then, uh, uh, uh, 20 seconds later, what the Moon goes by, uh, and then after a while  the Sun starts streaming in with this brightness, you know, it's, it, uh, there's no, uh, night  and day going out because the Sun's there all the time.  Uh, you can look toward the Sun and you can't see very many stars because it's too bright. 
[04:01:30]  Uh, but you look in the other direction and yes, after a while your eyes will accommodate  and you can see all the stars you want.  Fortunately, because we use those, uh, to navigate our way back home in the event that  the deep space tracking network is not giving us information, uh, into the computer as to  where we are and what we got to do to get back home again.  Use the stars.  We've got an, and we got the signal.  We have to, uh, we have to, uh, we have to thank, of course, uh, American legend, uh, Buzz Aldrin. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, we got to get you out of here.  You got to go do some TV buzz.  This was a pleasure.  Buzz Aldrin, everyone.  All right.  We got to, uh, we have time to squeeze something in, uh, Dick Vitale broke down.  We love crying audio.  Do we go there?  Oh, I love that.  Or do we go with the, I was raped, uh, t-shirts that someone is making?  Also crying video, uh, audio video.  Well, Dick Vitale, what is this, uh, Danny?  Basically he was nominated to be into the, uh, the basketball hall of fame, right? 
[04:02:30]  He's in now.  Oh, he's in?  So this was, he called in, well, he called in to, uh, uh, to, uh, a radio show earlier  in the day, and then I think at 11 a.m. yesterday it was made official.  Oh, okay.  He was inducted as a contributor.  Right.  So he never really played hoops.  No.  I wouldn't put any of these guys in that never actually played the game.  I don't, I don't care about that.  Yeah, like.  No, I'm serious.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  You're just an announcer.  There's a million of you.  Dick Vitale wasn't that special. 
[04:03:00]  It is odd to put in announcers.  It really is.  I'm going to play the game.  Name an announcer that really deserves to be in a hall of fame.  Uh, well.  Johnny Moe.  The scooter played.  Johnny Moe.  Stop.  When you're balls to crap.  That guy right there, Johnny Moe, Larry Bird, goes down, I'm going to perish.  Oh my God.  That guy?  Harry, Harry Carey.  Harry Carey.  Harry Carey.  How about you get them a broadcaster's hall of fame?  Yeah.  And you stick it somewhere.  Exactly.  No one wants to just go look at them, Ken.  Yeah. 
[04:03:30]  They have the, the boxing hall of fame is up, upstate, where is that?  Upstate New York somewhere?  It's just a hut on the side of a dirt road.  Yeah.  Some of these halls of fame are not even a hall.  You go in, it's a dollar.  It's a door jam of fame.  It is.  The boxing hall of fame is just disgusting.  It's like a dollar and they have like fists, just the black dude's fists in like glass  cases.  They open white jaws.  They've got ashtrays made out of them.  What's wrong with you? 
[04:04:00]  I don't know.  I was thinking of Jimmy's.  You ever go to Springfield?  You used to, what was that, your CD?  Yeah.  Trinkets I own made from Gorilla Hens.  Right.  You ever go to Springfield's Hall of Fame?  The basketball Hall of Fame?  No.  No, I drove by it though.  It looks like a big basketball.  It's an S-hole.  It is god awful.  The NBA has to take that over and do the right thing.  What's in Springfield?  A lot of carjackers.  Yeah, Springfield.  It's a horrible place.  Anyway, Dick Vitale breaks down at the Hall of Fame, I guess, what, ceremonies or whatever. 
[04:04:30]  Elected as a contributor.  Please welcome to the class of...  Elected as a...  What did he contribute to the...  To basketball?  Uh, contributor.  I don't know what that even means.  Elected as a contributor.  Please welcome to the class of 2008, Dick Vitale.  Dick E.V.  Is it awesome, baby?  What is it?  I tell you, Jim, it's mind-boggling. 
[04:05:00]  When I got the call, because I thought I was going to become the Susan Lucci of the Hall of Fame,  with all the rejections, but when he called and he said, sit down...  I'll be honest with you, I cried like a baby.  And I...  I sit here in awe.  Look at these giants.  And all I've ever done...  I can't run, can't jump, can't shoot, but just have had a tremendous...  I'd like to think passion about the game.  Oh, my God.  This is great.  Anthony's crying.  I'm crying over here. 
[04:05:30]  Anthony, what's wrong?  I'm crying.  I just put Vizena.  Eyes are burning from Opie's dump.  What?  Don't blame me.  You've had dry eyes all morning.  Hey, Dick, get a hold of yourself.  Exactly.  I mean...  Get a hold of yourself, indeed.  You're just a contributor.  Contributor.  Wasn't he saying, I can't jump, I couldn't shoot, but I have a passion for the game?  Right.  Right.  Well, then you shouldn't be in.  Right.  That's what I'm getting at.  How many people have a passion for the game, but they can't play it?  Get me in the Hall of Fame. 
[04:06:00]  Broadcasting Hall of Fame would be good, but no one would go to the Broadcasting Hall of Fame,  so you have to lump the broadcasters in with the real athletes.  It's in Dullsville, man.  My Jewish foster father, Ken Laz, should be in the Hall of Fame, if that's the case.  Get a real passion for the game.  He should be in the Porn Hall of Fame, except I can't keep it up, but I'll have a real passion for the game.  Yeah, exactly.  For the art.  Yeah, I'm with you.  And then it continues.  Listen to this.  More Dick Vitale.  My parents, I'd give anything for my mom and dad to be living today, because they were my greatest inspiration. 
[04:06:30]  My mother, I watched her with a stroke.  She'd take her legs and drag her legs down.  Jesus.  Go downstairs and sew coats.  My father would dress coats in a factory and then come home and walk the mall till 12 midnight.  And they inspired me and taught me about work ethic.  All right.  All right.  Get a hold of yourself.  Who's going to badmouth their parents in an induction thing like that?  Who would?  Right, right.  I wish my parents were alive to see this. 
[04:07:00]  Do you?  What?  See you bawling like an infant?  The father could realize he raised a Mary.  Come up and slap you in the face.  You know, this gives us a good excuse to play one of our favorites.  What's that?  Oh, okay.  When I grew up...  A few years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  Did you?  With two very bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player. 
[04:07:30]  Listen to true.  Best word ever.  I beg God that dream came true.  Go back to Dayton, crybaby.  Yeah.  Mike Schmidt.  And that flavor saver under your nose.  Let's try another one today.  Dick Vermeule.  I'm so appreciative of what my coaching staff has done. 
[04:08:00]  Is he the one that was always crying?  Which one?  It was Dick something.  That's the one.  Vermeule?  He's the one.  Yeah.  That guy, he couldn't stop crying.  If the guy had to double off the wall, I mean...  It was football.  It was football.  Oh, okay.  That's why he cried.  Yeah.  What the hell? 
[04:08:30]  They're playing football.  It's a bad football game.  They redid the NBA Hall of Fame.  It's nice.  Okay.  I don't know.  I haven't been there in years.  I'm sorry about that.  Shame on you, Opie.  Listen to the whole clip.  There's more with Dick Vermeule.  We'll go back to the beginning here.  And these players, jeez.  Unbelievers.  Okay, girl.  These guys are unbelievable people.  Well, nobody knows these guys, except maybe their moms and dads, or wives, better than 
[04:09:00]  I know them.  That's great.  Wonderful.  You've got to mention kids and uncles.  Want to try another one?  Sounds like an old movie, doesn't it?  Cry like a bitch Hall of Fame.  They should all be in that.  We've got Brett Favre, but this wasn't the recent one.  This goes back a bit.  After the game, Packers quarterback, Brett Favre, gave an emotional farewell.  Well, if it is my last game, I want to remember it. 
[04:09:30]  Stuff.  Stuff.  I miss these guys.  I miss the game, but I just want to let them know that.  I'm not moving here.  I'm not moving.  I wasn't planning on doing this, either.  Oh.  Ended up playing, what, another couple of years after that? 
[04:10:00]  At least another year.  I don't know.  In college.  And then we got Brett Boone when he was cut from the Seattle Mariners.  Pretty sad day for me.  He's a snot sucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I've gone through a lot in this city.  A lot of great times.  Hyping in the background.  And we've scuffled a lot last year and a half. 
[04:10:30]  I feel like a baby.  Sound like one.  This city seems so great to me.  And I've had a lot of success here.  Played with some great guys.  Great people just around.  And the fans are always good.  Awesome.  Great times.  Great people just around.  And the fans are always good. 
[04:11:00]  Awesome.  Great times.  Tough times.  And you guys have been good to me.  And I appreciate that.  Get a hold of yourself.  It must be tough, though.  I mean, you've been a macho man for, you know, 15, 20 years.  Never cried.  Never showed emotion to your wife or kids.  Yeah.  Right.  And then, you know, it's all over.  You're just going to be an old guy in a chair.  Well, no, no.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  So, Bobby, my theory is very, very simple. 
[04:11:30]  These guys cry because they're no longer going to be able to go around America and bang broads on the road.  Now they have no excuse.  They're stuck with their wife at home day after day after day after day.  They don't get to go to the cities and do their thing.  Yeah.  They're just home weed whacking.  Right.  And it's actually cool for like a couple months.  You're like, this is great.  Honey, bringing out iced tea, sitting on a couple of chairs.  You've never sat on with her.  And then it's just all downhill. 
[04:12:00]  Yeah.  I think today is nothing.  She comes out one day.  Did you take out the garbage?  I shouldn't take it.  You're like, you know, I was a major league baseball player.  Now I'm taking out the garbage.  He just cries every day after that, just like he did in his speech.  His wife is like, oh, my God, I'm married to a crybaby.  Hey, do you think you could take the kids to play when I first left Dayton, Ohio?  You're listening to The Virus.  The Ron and Fez Show starts now. 
[04:12:30]  How goes it?  What the hell you think? </pre>
