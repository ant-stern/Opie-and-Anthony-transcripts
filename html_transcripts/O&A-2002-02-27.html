<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a promotional blitz for their website, foundrymusic.com, featuring the “Wow” campaign – images of women, some topless, in various locations.  This was followed by discussion of several listener contests: the "Naughty Nighty" contest, with the winner, Stephanie from Washington, scheduled to join them at a post-show Hooters gathering; and the upcoming "55-gallon drum challenge,"  which involved soaking someone in lamb's blood. A ludicrous plan to create a Times Square disturbance using a blood-covered individual was also conceived.  Opie recounted his previous night's extensive Sims Golf gameplay, detailing his frustrations with the game's mechanics and characters like “I Am Picky,”  interspersed with discussions of other video games and their impact on their lives.  A lengthy, rambling phone call with Black Earl, participating in a Budweiser skiing promotion at Mountain Creek, added to the chaotic energy, marked by poor cell service and Earl’s refusal to ski down even a beginner slope despite the hosts' relentless, often offensive, encouragement.  Ross, another participant, was also briefly on the phone.  This segment was punctuated by frequent use of vulgar and offensive language.

The show then featured a call with Ebony, whose conversation included discussions about hair braiding, women's fighting styles, and a humorous anecdote about police and stickers.  Joe called in, proposing a scheme to turn in guns for cash and subsequently faxed his rap sheet to the show, detailing past offenses including an incident involving an "eight-ball jacket" and a submachine gun.  A “Black History Month tribute” ironically involved Stacy being sprayed with stage blood from Super Soakers, prompting a call from Sheila expressing discomfort with the show’s stereotypical portrayal of Black people. The segment concluded with the listener-submitted song, the "6 o'clock queef," and a promotion for a police-firefighter hockey game.  Throughout, highly offensive language and violent/sexually suggestive topics dominated the conversation.


The hosts then shifted to preparations for the "55-gallon drum challenge."  A woman named Maria, present in the studio, agreed to eat three spoonfuls of microwaved pig blood as her qualifying stunt. The hosts graphically described the blood's coagulation, expressing both disgust and amusement.  The show revisited Earl’s failed skiing attempt, learning he took the gondola down.  The "55-gallon drum challenge" preparations continued, showcasing large Super Soakers intended for lamb blood.  The hosts also recorded a sexually suggestive Hooters commercial and made a prank call to a woman's mother, falsely informing her that her daughter worked in the porn industry.  A listener contest involving a woman eating lamb brains was also mentioned.  The broadcast concluded with a "What Did We Learn" segment, featuring listener calls offering humorous takeaways from the day's events, further emphasizing the offensive and often absurd nature of the show.  The show also extensively promoted its post-show Hooters event, featuring the "Naughty Nighty" winner and Scott Farrell, their new morning show co-host. The discussion of the cop-firefighter hockey game highlighted a rule prohibiting beer sales after the first period.  Throughout the entirety of the broadcast, the hosts and callers consistently used highly offensive and vulgar language, discussing sexually explicit and violent themes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show!  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Yes.  Uh, no.  Uh, no.  Yeah, Dave!  Well, it's Whip Well Wednesday because it's Wednesday, Anthony, but still not really pushing the whole wow thing yet.  Oh, no, weather, the weather isn't really wow weather.  But you know that's spring right around the corner. 
[00:00:30]  We're going to get one more blast of winter here in New York, and then it's going to be all over.  Storm Opie, is that your name now?  Are you giving a weather forecast?  Always happens.  You get that one last blast.  Yeah.  But, uh, in the meantime, I mean, wow's still happening, ladies.  Oh, yeah.  So if you see a guy and he has wow in his car, he definitely wants to see something from you.  Without a doubt.  But in another, uh, I don't know, three or four weeks, we'll start really pushing wow.  Right.  We'll be hitting the streets with wow. 
[00:01:00]  But in the meantime, if you go to foundrymusic.com, our unofficial, uh, website, there's a link on opianthony.com for foundrymusic.com.  There's a great section called the wow me section, Anthony.  The wow me section.  The girls have brought wow indoors.  Yeah.  Well, in some cases, yeah, they've taken pictures of themselves, uh, holding wow stickers or wowing their body or something.  Sometimes they head out to the woods.  The wooden engine.  They head out to the woods to get their pictures taken topless, and then they, uh, end up on, on, uh, foundrymusic.com in the wow me section. 
[00:01:30]  Do you find that hot?  I think naked girl in the woods, very hot.  Outdoor naked girl picture, extremely hot.  And not even, I'm not talking like a, one of those model or playboy on the beach photos or something.  No, no, regular girl.  We're just talking about regular girl in the woods.  Naked.  Naked.  Kind of cool.  Huge turn on.  Huge.  That's pretty good.  Especially when you, you, you, you see the picture that it looks like it's kind of like isolated. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Kind of like in a backyard or something.  Right next door, a shallow grave.  Not like off a bike trail or something, you know?  Yeah.  It's right in the middle of the woods.  A hiking trail.  Hmm.  So, there you have it.  Uh, also, Steve was telling me that he's got some great video and some, uh, pictures of what happened yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  That poor girl, I think it was Sarah from Cleveland, eating, uh, lamb brain right from the skull.  Right from the skull.  Frenchie chopped the top of the skull off and just stuck a spoon in the brains. 
[00:02:30]  That's all the preparation.  That was it.  And she gobbled, gobbled up, uh, three heaping spoonfuls of lamb brain.  They were heaping, too.  Her face, when she ate it, was hysterical.  Hysterical.  She, uh, she just, she, you could tell she was just on the verge of puke.  She'd put a napkin in her hand in front of her mouth and then immediately grab the water and start drinking it.  Right.  So, I haven't seen the video clips, but, uh.  The video's pretty funny.  Yeah, cool.  Yeah, and she has qualified for the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[00:03:00]  That means we have four girls that have qualified.  I think we only have about four spots left, ladies.  Mm-hmm.  And one lady is on her way, Anthony.  On her way.  I can't believe we're doing this one today.  I, I have been psyched for this.  For some reason, I think this one's a little wrong.  Really?  Yeah, I think it's a little wrong.  We do a lot of crazy things on this show, but, uh, the girl's gonna stand in front of  the, um, the camouflaged green room.  Yeah.  We are camouflaging the Ikea furniture as we speak. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, we have to.  It's a new rule around here.  Mm-hmm.  That will not last.  Camouflage.  You paranoid schizophrenic.  Think there's helicopters outside your office, too?  Look out.  The bosses want us to camouflage, uh, the studio and the green room when we do some of our sick,  uh, things.  So if, uh, what, the FBI wants to investigate the show?  What is, why are we camouflaging?  I'll be honest.  The only reason we're technically camouflaging today... 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  ...is because we don't want blood all over the Ikea furniture.  We don't want it on the walls.  The splatter, uh, is gonna be...  We don't want it on our lovely, uh, the Terminator, uh, pinball machine or the post-ball table.  That's the reason you're gonna see some, some camouflaging going on today.  Mm-hmm.  That's the only reason.  We're gonna have to put her in almost a tunnel of tarp.  And, uh, then we're gonna stand back.  Super soakers in hand.  Some really, uh, the good ones, the high-pressure ones.  Yes.  Full of lamb's blood. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, man, let's just drop lambs at this point.  Full of blood.  She will then take off her clothes, down to her bra and panties,  and we will proceed to, uh, super soak her with blood.  Just shoot her.  You know what technique I'm gonna use?  I'm not gonna go with the big fire hose technique.  I'm gonna do little shots.  Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.  Just barely pulling the trigger.  Psh, psh. 
[00:05:00]  Little, so, so I can mark her up with blood real good.  And you and I have a little side wager, right?  First girl, uh, first girl.  Oh, first, hello.  First, uh, first guy to hit, uh, ground zero with the blood.  Right, exactly.  Uh, and-  Make it look like she's, uh, in need of, uh, an appliance.  We gotta thank Frank and Eddie's in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, for the sheep blood.  Really?  It's come down to this.  We gotta thank people for, uh, donating blood.  Frank and Eddie's for the blood.  Frank and Eddie's in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.  Thank you for the sheep blood.  We took a look at the blood, uh, yesterday. 
[00:05:30]  Can we take a look at it again?  Yeah, bring it in.  It's in a, uh, big gallon container.  And when you uncap it, to look through the container, because it's kind of a frosted white container,  it kind of looks pinkish, you know?  So it's like, wait, that doesn't look good enough.  But when you take the lid off and look inside, it's just a huge thing of, of blood.  That if that ever spilt, man, ooh.  No, I don't, I don't want it.  Look at that.  Bring it to Opie.  Yeah, I love chicken. 
[00:06:00]  That's a gallon of blood right there.  Yep.  I love the board.  Whatever.  It's nice and cold, too.  Pete Johnson.  Let's see.  Hey, you know what we ought to do with the leftover?  Pour it over our head?  No.  Dude, let's get somebody to just lay in the street and dump the blood on them  and have them fall down on the street and see what happens.  That'd be cool.  Or you could call it art.  It's like expressionist art or something.  We'll just get somebody to come running out of the building covered in blood and go, 
[00:06:30]  ah, and fall down on the ground.  Oh, my God.  Would that be great?  Well, if we have any takers, who wants to do it?  If any of our faithful listeners are hovering around the studio today, come on by and say hi.  Let's do it.  That'd be hysterical.  Oh, my God.  No, dude.  Even better.  What?  Because that's what they're expecting from us.  Yes.  Right outside on the Brooklyn, outside the Brooklyn Diner.  Uh-huh.  I say we go to Times Square where all the rubes are. 
[00:07:00]  Times Square.  Because somebody covered in blood gets out of a vehicle and just starts staggering down the sidewalk with the cell phone in their hand.  Yeah.  Getting reaction from all the people.  Oh, yeah.  Just like stumbling covered in blood.  Oh, yeah.  We need a good actor today.  Oh, come on.  Help us out.  With the hand somewhat tied.  Or even better.  Come on.  Running out of the subway stop over there in Times Square.  Because you know how all the tourists, when they come to New York, they think, like, the subways are so dangerous and stuff. 
[00:07:30]  Don't go in there.  They'll just come running out.  Running up the stairs completely covered in blood.  That's where we got to do this.  That is great.  We need somebody who can really pull it off.  Who could pull this off for us?  Hey, we'll give you something really good.  Come on.  You got to come up and wear crappy clothing so we could rip it a little bit.  We'll give you, like, a T-shirt to go home with.  And, yeah, just cover yourself in this blood. 
[00:08:00]  We'll have Rick on a cell phone.  Out of sight, Rick, because we don't want you getting arrested today.  I don't think it's arrestable.  And then just figure out where he could run from point A to point B.  Where he can stagger.  Stagger?  Yeah.  Better?  Fall down a couple times?  Yeah.  One shoe.  There's a lot of cops in Times Square, there.  In front of TRL.  No, but even.  Totally because live MTV.  Even better, though.  Yeah.  He's got to be covered with blood running right toward people.  So they just lose their effing minds. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  I am so into this right now.  I'm psyched.  I don't even want to do the rest of the show.  I just want to pull this off.  This sounds too good.  I love watching Rubes just freak out.  I hear New York's a lot safer than.  Oh, my God.  Once again, developing our radio show live on the air.  This just sounds like.  We were talking about all sorts of things in the back office.  This wasn't one of them that came up.  No, but this sounds like a lot of fun.  This is better than all the other crap we were talking about today. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  One of our peeps will step forward and say, hey, I'll do it.  Oh, my God.  It's even better.  Vinny from New York.  Have them run out of a limo screaming, no, Jason, leave me alone.  It's O.J.  He's gone crazy again.  We need a blonde woman.  A lot of people think we're kind of kidding here.  We really want to do this.  We'll do this today.  This will be really fun. 
[00:09:30]  We need one of our peeps that thinks he could pull it off to come by the station and give  it a whirl, as they say.  All right.  Hey, quick.  Could you just pop down Lou on line three?  Yeah, sure.  I just got to torture him.  Someday I'll be a Miss America.  Someday I am proud.  Is that stuck in your head, bro?  Oh, stuck in my head?  I've been singing it all day yesterday. 
[00:10:00]  Went to a medical office because I transport medical people, and the people there were giving  me the most dirtiest looks.  You know, my partner's like, shut up, shut up.  Shut up, shut up.  Hey, guys, I got a better gag.  Get that lamb's blood, soak it on the girl, and have like two or three boxes of tampons.  Come on, you know, I'll play with her.  Could you help me?  How do I use these?  I've ever walked down the sidewalk with a box of tampons and just very red down below. 
[00:10:30]  Like jeans, just completely soaked.  Oh, God.  We're losing our effing minds.  Thank you.  Okay, I'll go to the front of tools.  All right, bye.  Bye.  That's fun.  That is fun.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's up, bro?  Hey, Dick.  Hey.  Hey, Ace.  You guys are amazing.  Why?  You get these girls to compete just to be abused.  Well, not just to get abused.  There's some great prizes on the line for the 55-gallon horse challenge. 
[00:11:00]  Two Gs?  Two Gs.  Yeah, I guess.  Pretty good.  That's a good week's work.  I'm going down to Daytona tonight.  Yeah?  Bike week.  So there should be a lot of wows.  Well, give us a full report when you get back, all right?  I got it, man.  All right, bro.  Be good.  Yeah, we got to cut everyone off because on line six, Earl.  We have an Earl skiing song?  Earl skiing.  We learned late in the show yesterday, Ant, that Black Earl was going skiing today. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  What a goof that is.  Some Budweiser promotion.  They sent him to a mountain.  Mountain Creek.  Mountain Creek in Jersey, right?  And we were trying to get him on skis.  I said there was no way he was going to go on skis, but it looks like he might be on skis.  Where's Earl staying?  The Overlook Hotel?  We got to play the Earl on Ski song, though, Ant.  Earl be crashing, welcome down.  When he skis.  Bloody long.  Earl be breaking both his arms and his knees. 
[00:12:00]  Earl be tumbling down for miles.  He will do the public file.  Earl be crashing down the mountain when he skis.  Help me.  Earl be lying on his back in a cast.  Help me.  Help me.  He's broken all his fingers and his ass.  Somebody help me.  Earl be face down in a dish.  Crying like a little bitch.  Earl be lying on his back in a cast. 
[00:12:30]  Help me.  Help me.  That was thrown together real fast.  I like it.  Hey, Earl.  What's up?  Hello, Jeff.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, good.  There it is.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Here we go.  Your phone doesn't turn.  Great.  This is perfect for Earl doing an appearance for us.  You know what he was doing in the background?  Hey, guys.  We're on the air.  Yeah, we're on the air.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:13:00]  Earl, are you there?  Yes.  His phone is horrible.  And he just got a new one.  Someone call up Earl and tell him to get another phone.  Get a landline.  Awful.  I don't know what it is about him and his goddamn phones.  They suck always.  Even his phone is lazy.  Sucks all the time.  Doesn't work.  All the time.  Anthony, I got to tell everyone, I'm really tired today. 
[00:13:30]  Now, I noticed this.  Yeah, you came in a little.  I look a little disheveled, don't I?  A little tired.  I'm very tired.  I did not sleep last night.  Now, you might want to ask, oh, why didn't you sleep last night?  Yeah, what happened?  Are you worried about the radio show?  Are you worried about syndication?  Something important?  Are you like.  Hashing over that meeting yesterday?  Are you a little too hyped up because of the big meeting?  Yeah.  With the big, big boss?  Uh-huh.  Are you having sex all night long?  Whoa.  What was it?  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  I was playing Sims golf.  Till?  Like, and you're going to laugh, but for me, this is ridiculous.  Three in the morning.  No, that.  Come on.  That's like what time I go to bed.  But during the week, I don't make it till 11.  I really don't.  School nights, I don't make it till 11.  I was up till about three.  Sims came out with a new game.  It's Sims golf.  Kind of like the Sims games.  But this one, you kind of build the whole golf resort. 
[00:14:30]  You build the golf course, the resorts, and then you have to manage it so people come in  and are happy.  Right.  You got to make the holes challenging, but not too challenging.  You got to keep all your members happy.  What happens if you just make these straight, horrid little holes?  Oh, as they're going, they go, ho-hum.  Ho-hum.  Ho-hum.  Ho-hum.  Oh, this is easy.  Ho-hum.  Like they're bored, and then what happens if they just keep being bored?  So you as God, you start freaking out. 
[00:15:00]  You're like, oh my God, I better put a little water on this hole, and I better make a little  slope on the green.  A little dog leg.  A little sand.  Maybe do a little dog leg right with a little palm tree right where it starts going right.  So they have to think, wow, where am I going to hit it?  Yeah.  Ho-hum.  Ho-hum.  Ho-hum.  What happens if you leave it boring?  Huh?  What happens if you leave it boring?  If you leave it boring, they really start getting pissed off.  Yeah.  They're bored at first, but then they start getting really pissed off, and then they start cursing 
[00:15:30]  in their little Sims language.  Right.  Gibberish.  Yeah.  And then they start breaking their golf clubs, their tiny little golf clubs, and they  walk off the course, and they're not a member of your club anymore.  And that's how you make your money.  That's bad.  Very bad.  Because you need to make money.  Right.  To make better holes, and better hotels, and better driving ranges, and celebrities, they  build homes on your course.  Celebrities build homes on the course, and what does that do? 
[00:16:00]  It increases the value of your whole property, so then green fees for these members go up.  So you're making more money.  Make more money.  Now you can put in a water park and a marina.  What happens if the holes are too hard?  They get really pissed off, and they get rid of their memberships.  Break their little clubs.  Right.  But it's fun.  I'm taking a break from NHL 2002. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, how'd you do against the Rangers?  I still haven't played the Rangers.  You haven't played the Rangers yet?  I'm a little nervous.  I've got to make sure I'm ready for the Rangers.  I'll go back to that game.  You actually took the Olympic break off and everything?  Yes, I did.  I did, actually.  I'm a little ahead of schedule, though.  I'm in the playoffs with NHL 2002.  But anyway, so all night long, I'm trying to get my golf course just right until about  three in the morning, I played for like six straight hours after the show.  Six hours?  Didn't even eat.  Nothing.  Just right to the computer, right to Sims Golf. 
[00:17:00]  They get pissed off because they're hungry and thirsty.  So you've got to make little park benches in key areas so they can sit down and rest a  little bit.  Or they get pissed.  You get a little girl that gives them sodas in the middle of the course.  Do they have golf carts?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The golf carts effed me up, and that's why I was up all night.  What happened?  They start playing a little too fast.  And then they start piling up at a couple of these holes.  There's a bottleneck going on. 
[00:17:30]  So then you get a ranger, and he goes marching out there in his little Sims body with his  megaphone, and he's like, moving along, moving along, moving along.  And he gets pissed off at the golfers.  So then they have to start playing a little faster.  Ah.  The carts.  And the carts did that?  The golf carts?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so I had to get rid of the path from the cart house.  Right.  From the pro shop to the cart house. 
[00:18:00]  That means they can't use the carts.  Oh.  Because if there's a path connected, then they could go and use their carts.  Well, can't you just make it a little longer of a trip to the holes on the cart?  I haven't been able to buy enough land.  You keep expanding, Anthony.  I'm just figuring if you'll make the...  There's some kind of politician.  His name's I Am Picky.  I Am Picky.  Every once in a while, I Am Picky wants to play your course.  Wow.  And if he's very happy at the end of it, he's going to approve an expansion where you could 
[00:18:30]  buy another piece of land.  So then you can build more holes and make your holes better because you have more land.  So when I Am Picky hits the course...  Yeah.  Me being God, I'd start panicking.  So I make sure every hole is perfect.  Oh, yeah.  I make sure there's a little drinky poo for a little I Am Picky.  Gotta make him happy.  After he gets off every green.  How angry...  I make sure there's a park bench so he can sit down and relax after every hole.  How angry do the little Sims golfers get when a little Sim black guy plays on the course? 
[00:19:00]  Well, I noticed the black guys do get very pissed off, yes.  They don't have as much patience in this game for whatever reason.  Do the little white Sims give up their membership if you let little black Sims in?  You know how racist those golf clubs are.  Right, sir.  Those golf resorts.  My course is...  Yeah.  We have equal opportunity on my golf course, Anthony.  Ah.  Yes.  You can't pay off I Am Picky?  No, I haven't...  You can't bribe him?  I haven't figured that out yet.  Ah.  No.  And then, like, he starts playing and he comments after every shot. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, really?  You're like, oh, oh, does he like my hole?  Oh.  What if he goes, oh, hum?  Oh, he starts going, oh, hum.  And you're like, oh, my gosh, maybe I should fix this hole real fast before he hits his  second shot.  And you're just sitting there waiting for his reaction.  He's like, oh, wow, this golf course has a lot of variety.  I'm liking this.  Oh, I'm making you feel a little good about yourself.  But then the next hole, there's a little backup, and he starts screaming in his little Sims voice,  don't these people know who I am?  I'm like, oh.  So then I get the ranger out there. 
[00:20:00]  It's like, oh, my God.  Don't these people know who I am?  So then I get the ranger out there to move him along.  Move him along.  Get out of I Am Picky's way.  Ah.  Get out of the way.  Winning that caddy tournament.  I got some audio from I Am Picky.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I taped it last night at 3 in the morning.  This calls for the old Billy Barul.  He doesn't sound happy.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Whoa, Billy, Billy.  This is a biggie. 
[00:20:30]  Don't let me down, Billy.  $38,000.  Actually, that's audio of me looking on as he's playing the 18th hole, hoping he likes my chorus.  And one time, the bastard he played my whole chorus didn't like it.  Really?  He didn't approve an expansion.  How'd you like to move my role?  Exactly.  So anyway, the point I'm trying to make, so I played this for like five or six straight hours last night.  I finally go to bed at 3, and I'm like, okay. 
[00:21:00]  You know, I can leave my little computer game behind.  Time to go to sleep.  This is where everyone can relate, no matter what effing game you play.  Game you're addicted to.  I know a bunch of people are calling me fags.  One guy's like, what's next?  Sims gardening?  Faggot?  Anyway, so I'm in bed, and now my mind is racing all night long.  So you're laying there, you're tired, but you're starting to think.  Starting to think, I'm like, should I make the sixth hole into a water hole to make it a little more challenging? 
[00:21:30]  You know, I think my par three is a little too short and a little too easy.  Maybe I should add a sand trap in the middle of the fairway.  Oh my God, it's 3.30.  I've been laying here a half hour, and I'm not asleep yet.  Right.  But I can't get the game out of my stupid brain.  So all night long, I'm racing.  I'm like, how can I slow down the people when they're all in carts?  They're all just in carts going around and around my course over and over again.  I can't slow them down.  I could figure this out.  And how am I going to get all the fungus off the course that is growing? 
[00:22:00]  Because all the weeds and the dandelions and the fungus start growing all over your goddamn greens, and that messes up play, Anthony.  Jeez, what time is it?  Oh my God, I'm in the country and it's morning.  All night long, though.  I'm thinking of new designs for this stupid game.  Yeah.  It's a stupid, stupid game.  Oh yeah, you know something?  A lot of people say, what are you playing?  That is a stupid game.  Yeah, but you know something? 
[00:22:30]  It's stupid and you can't stop playing it.  I like playing Sims every once in a while.  Yeah, it's cool.  You explain it like potato chips.  You take a little chip, a little chip here, a little chip there, a little chip here.  You're just eating the chips.  And you can't stop eating the chips, Anthony.  It's not one of those life or death games, you know?  You're not running around with heavy weaponry trying to eliminate someone that's killing you.  Because in my case, I got my course.  I'm only up to 12 holes.  I'm still waiting for expansion to make it into an 18-hole course.  You can't even have an 18-hole course? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, because damn I Am Picky is getting a little too picky.  Ah.  Won't I unleash some of the land for you to finish your golf course?  I need another character called I Am Pissed and he needs an automatic weapon to follow I Am Picky around.  I Am Mob.  And then, so I got my 12 holes where I like them.  Yeah.  So now I'm just waiting for the expansion, but it's never good enough.  So now I look at the holes and I'm like, oh, maybe I'll make it better.  A little bush here.  A bush makes it better.  Oh yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Oh yeah.  I got a little Stonehenge statue that one of the members donated.  I got to figure out where to put it on the course.  Oh, that'll be good?  It's real good.  Makes them a little happier.  Oh yeah?  So you got to see which hole they're not too happy at.  So you put Stonehenge over there and they're a little happier.  As you stare at the screen.  For hours and hours.  You got the beer girl in the cart?  Yeah.  Does she go around?  Yeah, but you got to like, you know, you got to take care of the golfers over here.  Oh, but these people are thirsty over here.  When do you decide to move her? 
[00:24:00]  Uh-oh.  Time to move the beer girl.  And then I have low self-esteem in my gaming world.  So I really take it personally when I see the comments and they're not liking what they're doing on my course.  Take it personally.  Oh yeah?  You know, I can make fun, but I'm just as guilty.  I sit in front of those games and hours go by.  It's three in the morning.  I've woke up to come in here and I get out of bed. 
[00:24:30]  I can't open my eyes.  I got computer game hangover.  Where you've just been staring at a screen.  Your whole body isn't moving.  All that's moving is your hand for the mouse, the keyboard, and your eyeballs.  So you go to sleep.  You wake up.  I'm just like, oh, I had to get Visine.  I have Visine just because of the goddamn games.  And I squeeze it into my eyes and get mad at myself for spending so much time.  What about this one?  I'm going to date myself a little bit.  Because in gaming, you know, if you talk about a game that's a year old, you're, you know, what's wrong with you? 
[00:25:00]  Right.  I'm going to go a few years back now when I was playing some of the Tomb Raider games.  Yeah.  And I would drive into New York to do the radio show.  You start looking at buildings, figuring out how you could kind of like, you know.  I could swing up on that.  Yeah, I could swing up on that.  I could work this ledge.  I could jump from that building to that building, climb up to the top of that roof, go back down to this roof.  Same thing with first-person shooter games.  You go on a subway and you're like, all right. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  I got that one.  I'll take out that person.  I'll take out that.  I'll jump on the train.  You know what?  That's a good one.  I could leave a satchel bomb right there and I'll detonate it.  Dude, I was playing Grand Theft Auto 3 so much.  I finally had to stop.  I haven't completed the game.  I'm close.  But I had to stop.  I would get in my regular car and you start believing that you could do the things with your SUV that you could do in Grand Theft Auto 3. 
[00:26:00]  You know what I mean?  I'm going for the stunt bonus.  Like, all of a sudden, you see red lights.  I mean, this is for all the people that have done Grand Theft Auto 3 to death.  In that game, do you pay attention to red lights?  No.  After a while?  No.  In the beginning, you're like, oh, we've got to follow all the traffic rules until you figure out it doesn't mean crap.  You fly through them at 100.  Right.  I hope no one's coming.  So now I'm in my real car and I'm coming up on traffic lights and they're red and I have to think twice.  Like, whoa, dude, you're in a real car.  Stop right now.  I just hit the gas.  How often do you get sideswiped in that game? 
[00:26:30]  And you see some of those SUVs on the streets when you're really driving and you think it's the cartel and you think they're following you.  It's the cartel.  It's the triads.  Well, that's when you see the triad fish truck.  Sure.  The big fish truck.  The Asian fish truck.  I start ducking down when I'm driving.  I see those trucks and I think it's the triads after me, Anthony.  Yes.  You pick up any real hookers to get your health up in real life?  No?  I was wondering.  Very funny. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I'm just as guilty.  All right, let's go to Rich.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  You got to be careful with what you say, man.  You just said like 10 minutes ago, I hope he likes my hole.  I know.  And you know what sucks about this show?  You're always thinking in the back of your head, what is going to be used for a sweeper?  Out of context.  As soon as I said that when I was describing the Sims golf, I'm like, oh, good.  Rick's going to have that for Anthony by tomorrow.  You like my hole?  Yeah.  I hope he likes my hole.  All right.  Thank you, bro. 
[00:27:30]  You got it.  All right, let's go to Tony.  A lot of people can relate to this.  Tony, you're up.  Hey, I used to, when Doom came out, we used to play it all night long until the sun came  up.  I go into work the next day and they could tell you were up all night.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You spend hours at these games.  I got gaming hangover today.  One more.  I know with my faggot game EverQuest, I sit there and just go one more level, one more  level.  Then I go to bed.  One more.  One more.  One more.  But some of these games you can't stop. 
[00:28:00]  That's what I'm trying to get at.  I don't know.  It really is an addiction.  Yeah.  Because I'm like, okay, my golf course looks good.  I'm going to bed.  And then I don't turn the game off.  I'm like, well, I'll go downstairs and get a glass of water.  And then I come back up and they're playing, by the way.  Oh.  You can leave the game.  The whole time, right.  You can leave the game and they're just going round and round your course and you're getting  more and more money.  Mm-hmm.  So you check in every once in a while, see how things are going.  Why don't you just leave them while you're sleeping?  I was thinking of that.  But I think it would be a disaster.  I think I'd have dead little sim golfers all over the course.  Like they jammed up and no one was there to move them along. 
[00:28:30]  No food, so they died.  And then when one guy gets pissed off and he has to walk off the course as he's breaking  his clubs all the way back to the clubhouse, he gets everyone else upset.  Well, no one wants to see that.  They get all upset.  Of course they do.  And then you have to try to calm them down somehow.  James, what's up?  What's it, Opie?  I was wondering, in this game, do you get to kill any golfers?  Yeah, they should have that feature, man.  Check me on this one.  But if I kill all the golfers, they'll lock me up for sure.  Let me tell you something.  Not the golfers! 
[00:29:00]  The reason I like this game a lot is that, you know, I was a caddy for, what, like 14 years  at the Huntington Crescent Club.  The caddy.  Ran into Muzz the other day.  He's still caddying it over there.  Oh, yeah.  Something years.  Hey, Muzz.  Wow.  And Caddyshack, one of my favorite movies.  I'm telling you, if Sims Golf put some of the Caddyshack things into this game, I'll  forget it.  I wouldn't sleep at all.  Can you imagine?  Like a Bill Murray character walking around and stuff?  Oh, the Greenskeeper.  It would be hilarious.  Hey, Greenskeeper. 
[00:29:30]  That's my schedule.  Dave, what's going on?  Nothing much, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Good, good, good.  First time, long time.  All right.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, exactly.  How about State of Emergency?  You guys been playing that?  Well, we played it a little bit.  We kind of, you know, I think Rockstar's going to be a little mad at us, but we kind of panned  that one.  It was a little bit of a letdown from Grand Theft Auto 3.  Yeah, no, I know.  I kind of got stuck on it.  I can see.  Because another game's got me up until 5 o'clock in the morning.  But, Dave, in all fairness, we kind of panned it on the air, and we got a lot of email 
[00:30:00]  from people going, how could you guys pan that, you know, that game?  I'm loving it.  So, I don't know.  There are people out there liking it.  I just need a little more with my game.  I like the violence and the blood and the killing.  Well, that's kind of cool.  There is one part where their bodies blow up, and then you can pick up their limbs and stuff  and beat other people up.  You can throw a hard, pick up a limb.  After a while, I'm looking for, you know, what else, what else, you know?  Yeah, there's, you know, something that you could, you've got to get some variety in your 
[00:30:30]  gaming.  At least I do.  I can't just always play first-person shooters or something, you know?  True.  You've got to go to something like The Sims or something good to just F around with.  Yeah, keep you on the gate tip, I guess.  No, I switch, you know what, I switch it up.  I have no problem playing The Sims games.  You know.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  You guys suck.  Peace.  Peace.  All right.  There's one more guy, and then we've got to move on.  Andrew had something.  Andrew, what's up, bro?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:31:00]  Hey.  Hey, for a while, I was into Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Yeah.  Like, where you build these big roller coasters, but you can't make them too bad, or the people  start puking everywhere.  Yeah, they puking.  I heard about that.  It's a fine balance.  And then you've got to, don't you have to build the park, too?  Yeah, but like, when they start puking, you hire your workman, and you're like, well, I  need more guys to clean up the vomit.  It's all over the park.  Yeah, I bought one amusement park sim game, and...  Was it good?  It was a disaster.  Like, I'm setting up the rides and everything, and you've got to make paths to the rides, 
[00:31:30]  and then people are bitching, because I didn't put it in bathrooms.  Yeah.  So I put the bathrooms in, but I put the bathroom too close to the food concession, so they got  pissed off at that.  That's how the golf course thing is.  Yeah.  Because then you have little snack bars all over the course, and they have to be connected  to the main pro shops, and you have to figure out where to put the pads so you don't F up  your holes and stuff, you know?  And then the, like, I started getting some people into the park, finally, and I noticed,  like, the people, the lines are getting longer, and the people are getting pissed off, and I 
[00:32:00]  didn't realize the rides were breaking, because I didn't have any maintenance people.  So they're getting all pissed off that the rides are breaking, so I had to hire maintenance  people, and I'm losing money.  Right.  Well, if you don't secure our rides, they'll start, like, exploding, and people start dying.  Yeah, then they start dying.  Or people, mine was, they wouldn't die, but they'd get stuck on the rides.  I've had them, like, blow up before, and a thousand killed in your park.  It's very...  Try to get more people in your park after that.  I did feel like that Cartman episode with Cartman Land.  Remember when he got the, he bought the amusement park?  Yeah.  And, because he just wanted to be in it, but then he had to hire the guy to keep everyone 
[00:32:30]  else out, and he had to pay him, so he had to hire people, yeah, let a few more people  in to pay for the security guy, then he had to pay for the ride maintenance, and that's  how I felt.  I'm like, huh, but I was just doing so good.  I was making some money, and now I've got to hire maintenance people.  You know, it's, these games are so stressful, because just when you think you have it figured  out, they've got something going on.  Another ranch gets thrown in.  Because, like, my course was great.  I'm getting members joining every freaking, like, crazy, right? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So I sit back, and I'm like, look at me.  Look at what I did.  Then all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, what's that?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, fungus starts growing everywhere.  And I didn't realize...  Fungus!  I didn't realize the fungus and the dandelions and the weeds were going to start growing,  like, everywhere.  So you need a greenskeeper.  Yeah, but now it's completely out of control, because I waited too long.  So I'm like, oh, my God.  And I figured out how to get the, you know, a grounds crew.  And so he ran out to, like, hole four, five, and six.  He could do a whole big area. 
[00:33:30]  And I'm like, okay, phew.  And then I go to the other part of the golf course.  I'm like, oh, my God.  The weeds are growing there, too.  Yeah.  And now the golfers are getting completely pissed off.  And now they're all, like, canceling their memberships left and right.  And it was a complete disaster.  You get all disappointed in yourselves, don't you?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I'm listening to DC.  Cool, man.  Got a little spark of light down here.  Yes, DC.  Thanks, Andrew.  Later.  All right.  All right.  Well, but that's why I'm out of it today. 
[00:34:00]  It was just racing in my head over and over again.  Yeah, because the game is one part of it.  And then after you go to bed, you start thinking about your strategy for when you get on again.  Trust me.  It's a stupid game.  I'll be the first to admit it.  Most of them are.  It's keeping me pretty entertained right now.  Most of them are stupid games.  Very addicting.  All right, Anthony.  I'm hearing that.  What's her name?  Maria?  Oh, my God.  Maria's here, and so are the Super Soakers. 
[00:34:30]  What the hell are those?  Go to the helicopter.  What the...  Dude, do we have enough blood to put in those things?  Yeah.  No, you know something?  Shave some of the blood for our other little event that we want to do.  Let me see that one.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll check out the Super Soakers, and we'll talk to Maria.  She's going to try to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge today.  We have a lot of things to get to today, so...  Uh-oh.  There's no blood in there, is there? 
[00:35:00]  What is with the multi...  Oh, it's different, um...  Dude, put some water in that.  I want to just see, you know...  I want to see it fire with just water to see what we're...  What we can expect.  Put some water.  What is with the double-barrel one there?  With, like, 80 friggin' different types of...  What the...  What is this?  Where have we been?  This is what Super Soakers have become?  Yeah.  I used to buy them from my nephew and stuff, and they were, what, maybe two feet long?  Yeah, they used to be, like, a little, uh...  Dude, your Super Soaker is almost five feet long.  It looks like an alien when you're pointing it at somebody. 
[00:35:30]  It's double-barrel.  It comes...  It's got a bipod that folds down from the front, so you could, like, lay on the ground with it.  Cool!  Wow, these things are really good.  It sucks that there's going to be blood on it.  All right, boy, imagine when you were a kid, when everyone was going around with those stupid little pistols that would leak.  You just go to the playground with one of these and just...  What is that?  All right.  Yeah, because if I could time travel, I'd take one of these back instead of, you know, anything else. 
[00:36:00]  And really fast, we should announce, too.  We're going to announce this all day, but after the show tomorrow, we're going downstairs.  Is it official, Ben?  Downstairs to Hooters, Anthony.  Yeah!  We haven't had a beer with our listeners in New York in a very long time.  And quite frankly, after the September 11th thing, we just really didn't feel like doing much.  What thing is that?  Oh, yeah.  It kind of was...  Everyone seems to have forgotten.  Well, I hope they haven't forgotten, but it was a real downer for all of us, and we kind of, like, faded into the woodwork. 
[00:36:30]  But I think it's time to at least go and say hi and have some beers.  And a little special bonus tomorrow.  Yeah.  The winner of the Naughty Nighty contest, Stephanie from Washington, D.C., contestant number 37, who won it all yesterday.  She is coming...  Someday!  She is coming up to hang with us and our listeners, Anthony.  Right.  She'll be on the show, and then right after the show, Hooters Downstairs, that's 56 between 7th and Broadway.  Right.  Now, okay, what should we go with?  Hey, this is Steve-O, and you're listening to the Opie and Andy show. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I?  F***.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony show, and illegal street narcotics are keeping me alive.  N-E-W.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Don't forget New York, tomorrow night, right after the show, we're going downstairs to Hooters.  You know the deal. 
[00:37:30]  Time for another beer fight.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we got into a big beer fight.  Yes, we did.  I think we have to promise Hooters we're not going to have another beer fight.  Well, we won't have an obnoxious, friggin' drunk girl down there throwing beer at us.  Instead of producing a show on Fox, like she should have been.  It's Hooters, 56 between 7th and Broadway.  Right after the show, we're going down to hang with you guys. 
[00:38:00]  We're bringing Stephanie, the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest.  She's coming up from Washington.  And Scott Farrell will be there.  Scott Farrell's hanging out with us.  Our morning guy here in New York, so that should be fun.  And that means there's going to be a fight.  Anthony, you were trying out the Super Chokers?  Oh, yeah.  I put some water in it.  Pumped it up.  The single barrel one.  And as you see, the wet spots on some of the acoustic wall material here.  It's water.  It'll try.  But I just, that's three quick blasts. 
[00:38:30]  Bop, bop, bop.  Oh, this is going to work real nice.  And it's just, she is going to look like a murder victim.  When are we going to do the blood test to make sure the blood will fly through this thing?  As soon as we get the tarp set up.  I guarantee the blood will fly through this.  Guarantee?  Yeah.  You can tell it's liquid enough.  It's very thin.  And these Super Chokers pump out so much pressure, there's no way it's not going to come out.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I want to wear the big rubber, stinky, wiffle ball bat challenge gloves. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  Because the second I stop pulling the trigger, some water leaked on my hand.  And I can just picture that being blood.  Hey, Blue Nicky.  Blue Not Joe checking in, Anthony, on the instant feedback.  Opie, did you become a caddy because of Caddyshack?  Caddy?  Did you?  No, I became a caddy because Mommy and Daddy weren't going to buy me anything growing up.  Who becomes a caddy, though?  Like, I know.  Who becomes a caddy?  I'll tell you.  I was 12 years old.  My friends had paper routes. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Making, back then, maybe 15 bucks a week.  Yeah.  I was pulling down 15 to 20 bucks a day as a 12-year-old.  I mean, no, it sounds cool and all, but I don't know anybody's...  So I would go to the candy store up there in Centerport.  Yeah.  I was into baseball cards way back then.  Then, Ant, my friends would go in with their hard-earned money and plunk down some money  and buy one pack of cards.  Yeah.  I'd buy the whole goddamn box.  Oh, piss...  You were pissing people off.  I'd buy the whole box.  And let's open up that box now and see what Opie bought.  He's kept them sealed in his room. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my God.  It's a bunch of crap.  Nothing.  I'd buy them tops baseball cards.  Do you eat all the gum or just share?  You know, that powdery, crack-in-half gum.  It was pretty good.  Me and my brothers were into...  Flavor that lasted in the tens of seconds.  We were into baseball card collecting that.  We would not eat the gum and we wouldn't open the packs half the time, Anthony.  Crabby gum!  Crabby gum!  Crabby gum!  Crabby gum! 
[00:40:30]  Comes with it, people!  You're getting extra here with the cards.  I want Caddy to make a living at 12.  Caddy, did you?  I didn't do it to have fun.  Did you look like the little girl trying to carry the bag in Caddy's Shack?  I was a midget growing up.  You're right.  I didn't grow until I was a senior in high school.  I can do it.  I can do it.  Well, these ass munches, they would put everything in their golf bag, too.  So we would dump it out in the middle of the woods.  Really?  Yeah, the first chance we got, if they hooked the ball close to any woods 
[00:41:00]  and we had to go kind of in to look for their ball, we emptied their bags.  Really?  Sometimes stole their money.  Did they get mad, break their clubs, and cancel their membership?  These guys were so rich.  Crooked little caddies.  These guys were so rich that they had these just wads in their bag.  Yeah, you pull a 10 out.  I am picky?  Did you ever caddy for I am picky?  I caddy for many I am pickies.  They would have the stupid, they would have ball finders. 
[00:41:30]  Ball finders?  This contraption where it was just like a stick.  Yeah.  But it opened up to a really long stick.  Oh, I've seen that with a little scoop at the end.  A little scoop at the end so they could get their ball from underneath a bush or something.  Or get it when it's in the water.  That would be thrown in the woods.  Their umbrellas would be thrown in their woods.  Some of these guys would have a spare set of golf shoes that they'd shove in their bag.  Some of these bags would weigh 100 pounds each.  Throw it in the woods.  Throw it in the woods.  All the time.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:42:00]  That just don't seem right.  Huh?  That just don't seem right.  Dude, these guys, I mean, they didn't care.  Back then, these guys were buying brand new clubs every week.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden, the golf pro was like, hey, try these pings.  They're the latest rage.  Try the pings.  So they would have the round of their life.  So they would throw their Wilson staffs away like that's just crap clubs.  And now they're playing with pings.  First bad round with the pings, guess where the pings were going?  In the garbage. 
[00:42:30]  I just didn't know anybody that was a caddy.  Oh, my whole neighborhood was caddy.  Like growing up now, it was just, you know, you go to the local restaurant and wash dishes.  Caddying seems a lot more fun and lucrative.  It was kind of fun.  We'd get high on the course.  I was introduced to pot by the Wallace brothers.  Oh, yeah?  I was just a kid, 14, smoking pot, eh?  That's good.  Smoking some pot.  Well, because we had all sorts of codes and stuff on the golf course. 
[00:43:00]  And we had areas on the golf course where we would stash the pot.  So you would take a drag or two and leave it for the next caddy.  Oh.  But you had to be in, in the secret little caddy club.  You didn't want the nerds smoking the pot because they might tell somebody.  Right.  Rat you out.  So it was a big day when the Wallace's said, hey, hey, you want a little something of this?  I go, yeah, I'll try it.  And then, you know.  You added them out.  No. 
[00:43:30]  From that day on, I was in.  I knew if I wanted it, it was there.  In the tree.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  He's half as good as he says and he's going to have to play me to prove it.  We had secret signs just to make the other caddies laugh because you would always, like, have to caddy for dicks.  Yeah.  A lot of the guys were cool, but, you know, someone had to caddy for the dicks and, you know, it was your turn.  You know what I mean?  You know all the signs, like, you would four caddies.  So they would be on the tee and they'd hit their ball.  And if it's in a trap, you'd kind of make a sign like, it's in the trap. 
[00:44:00]  Okay.  Like, down.  Two thumbs down means in the trap.  Right.  If they're not really sure where the ball landed because they really can't see, you can give them the safe.  Like, you're safe on the fairway.  You're going to be okay.  Okay.  Don't worry.  I got it.  My brother, my brother Brett, came up with this one sign because he just hated caddying.  This was the sign.  Oh, the big universal sign of the...  The D head.  The D head.  You're a D head.  So he would make a huge, huge D with his body. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  He would put his two hands up on the top of his head so it looks like the head of your D.  And he would just give the guy this sign.  The other caddies would laugh their asses off.  And every once in a while, a golfer would go, what's that sign mean?  And he would say something like, oh, it means you're, not only are you safe, but you're lying really nice for your next shot.  You're a D head.  He was basically telling the whole course that he hates him, you're a dick.  It was fun.  All right, where are we?  This guy's 42 and still caddies. 
[00:45:00]  Kurt, what's up?  Hey, I'm a computer electronic technician.  I'm 42 years old.  I still caddy on the weekends.  I make, if I four caddy, two up, two down, I can make $150, $160 in four and a half hours cash.  Yeah, cash under the table.  And it's, you can't beat it.  You just can't beat it.  All right, thanks, bro.  Hey, Earl's checking in again.  He's skiing today. 
[00:45:30]  Skiing, Earl.  Earl.  Gentleman.  You finally found a phone that works?  We're at the top of the mountain.  That's the story.  We've got the best signal.  I'm about to attempt to go down the mountain.  Earl, have you, Earl.  Yes, sir.  Have you tried skiing yet?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  You're on the bunny slope.  How is, oh, you're on the bunny slope.  I was on the bunny slope.  Now I'm at the top of the mountain.  I hear the wind at the top of the mountain. 
[00:46:00]  Earl's at the top of the mountain.  Now you have your phone with you?  Uh, yeah.  And you're going to go down the mountain on the phone?  Uh, no.  Why not?  Well, I can do work.  Let's just hold the phone and go down the mountain.  What?  Hello?  Yeah, Earl.  Ah, you pussy.  We're here.  Oh, there you are.  Hey, Earl, is it true they're calling you, uh...  I've heard some horrible things that people have called you up there so far.  Yeah, we're just hearing rumors, Earl. 
[00:46:30]  Are they calling you Susie Blackstick?  No.  And the worst one I heard yet, uh, oh, I heard that...  Uh, is some...  Did somebody call you Jigaboo Street?  Earl?  Comment?  Did someone call you that?  Because I'll kick their ass.  Earl?  Earl?  Oh, my God.  He fell off the mountain.  Oh, my God.  Earl's in an avalanche.  Earl?  Earl?  You all right? 
[00:47:00]  No one's calling you those names, right?  Uh, no.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Well, you tell us if somebody, uh, abuses you.  Yes, we will.  Remember this song?  Yeah.  George, George, George of the jungle, strong, yes, he can be.  Look out, Earl.  Watch out for that dream.  George, George, George of the jungle, there's a light that's green.  Uh-oh.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl of the slope.  Ow.  He makes his escape with the help of his friend. 
[00:47:30]  A ding, ding, ding.  Uh, the wind blows his jungle.  Yes, we are.  Earl.  Yeah.  Earl, uh, you're not trying to play football on the, uh, slopes, are you?  Like the Kennedys?  Uh, no, I will not be doing my Michael Kennedy impersonation.  And you're not going to do it when it gets dark, like Sonny Bono, and go into a tree,  right?  Um, I am not planning on getting acquainted with any trees.  Very good.  Hey, Earl, who's with you?  Um, we got a couple of instructors. 
[00:48:00]  This is Lisa Orban here, and we've got the road crew with us.  They're laughing their asses up.  They're enjoying every second of this.  People are calling you Jean-Claude Mouly?  No?  No.  Good.  But, uh, we have to pay Budweiser for this wonderful trip.  Oh, yes.  Uh, hey, put Rossi on the phone.  Oh, yeah, hold on.  All right, we'll find out how Earl's doing on skis.  What's going on? 
[00:48:30]  Hey, Rossi.  Yo.  We got you on the air, man.  So, are you guys at the top of the mountain with Earl?  We just got off the gondola.  We're on top.  The gondola?  Ready to go down.  They're going to kill him.  Yeah.  They're going to kill him.  There's pretty much no way down or he won't die.  Oh, brother.  Hey, was Earl practicing on the Jungle Bunny Slope?  Yes, the Jungle Bunny Slope.  Oh, my God.  He scared all the kids off the slope.  No, no.  I cannot stand by. 
[00:49:00]  I'm sorry.  Holy Jesus.  He made everybody leave.  He was yelling as he was going down.  Oh, was he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well, uh, so he's going to attempt skiing from the top of the mountain.  From the, all the way on the top.  Can we get a little play-by-play from somebody?  I want to, I want to, as this happens, I want somebody giving commentary on the phone.  Yeah, how about.  We'll try.  I don't know about the signal, but we'll try to.  No, Ross.  Ross.  We're not stupid.  He ain't going to make it too far.  So, yeah.  Have Earl go and you tell us what happens. 
[00:49:30]  All right, cool.  All right.  All right, there he goes.  I am not going to get there.  What?  What?  Earl.  Earl.  Rossi.  He's got a good look.  Oh, man.  I think he just got a good, I think they said he just got a good look at the, uh, the slope.  Oh, really?  You know how it is when you get off and you go down and look down at the slope, it freaks  you out.  Especially after you've been on the bunny trail. 
[00:50:00]  Uh, come on, Earl.  You finally reached the mountaintop.  Oh, my God.  Rossi.  It ain't the king had in mind.  It ain't the one, it's not the one Dr. King had in mind, though, is it?  All right.  You report after to him.  Now, Earl, we're losing your signal a little bit.  Go back to where it was working.  Don't move around too much.  Yeah.  I gotta hear a little bit of a play-by-play.  Yeah.  Uh, Earl, can you hear us?  Barely.  All right.  Now, are you going to go down this slope? 
[00:50:30]  Earl?  Oh, man, why is this phone popping up?  You got little pieces of what's going on.  Now, Earl, are you going to go down the slope?  Oh, this sucks.  I wish I could hear.  God.  It's kind of hard because he's up on a mountain, but I would love to.  I don't know what's going on.  All right.  Earl, put Rossi back on the phone.  Hold on.  All right.  I think Earl's like a cell phone kryptonite.  Something in his head.  Can't get through the thick bone of his head. 
[00:51:00]  Here we go.  All right, Rossi.  Yep.  Why does the phone work when Rossi talks into it?  What, sir?  Yeah, how come the phone works when you're talking into it?  It doesn't work when Earl's got it.  He's so scared.  All right.  We're going to do the radio?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  He's still not getting on the skis.  What do you mean getting on the skis?  Oh, he has to put the skis on it.  For the gondola, you have to take your skis off.  Oh, I see.  All right.  Hey, Ross, hold on, okay?  All right.  Cool. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  We'll go back to them when Earl's ready to do it.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Make sure they don't go anywhere.  While we take a break, we've got to talk to the girl that's going to get super soaked  by the blood today.  Yeah.  And we'll do that next.  And I want to remind you guys once again, right after the show tomorrow, Hooters 56 between  7th and Broadway.  Scott Farrell's going to be there.  We're going to be there.  We're going to be drinking with our listeners.  Yep.  And we're going to introduce the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest down there to everybody,  Stephanie from Washington, D.C.  So join us right after the show tomorrow night. 
[00:52:00]  Хорошо.  У них есть эти большие тыцки.  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  And ride.  Тыцки.  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip.  And ride.  Тыцки.  Wednesday.  It's off the hook, yo.  O.P. and Anthony.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hello.  Hello.  The green room has been camouflaged.  Did you go outside during the break-in?  No, I haven't taken a look yet.  Just real fast.  Go to the door and back. 
[00:52:30]  It's camouflaged.  Isn't that weird?  No one's going to tell where this stunt.  Happened.  I think, more importantly, there's not going to be blood all over the new furniture.  I hope not, anyway.  It's going to look like a crime scene.  It certainly is going to look like a crime scene. 
[00:53:00]  We're getting close to the blood super soaking.  A lot of preparation has to be made out there.  The tarp's being hung.  And we got the super soakers.  I can't wait.  It's going to look great.  Wham!  I think she's a little freaked out.  Why?  I don't know.  She's kind of quiet in the corner.  We'll get her on the air in a few minutes here.  Yeah.  But first, we've got to go back up to the top of the mountain.  Ah.  Where Black Earl is on skis and ready to go down the mountain. 
[00:53:30]  I'll take that, guys.  Ah, Ross.  Boom.  All right.  What's going on, bro?  We got to the end of the trail.  We're about to go down.  And he has taken off his skis.  He does not want to go down.  Oh, come on.  If he's pushed out, he wants to go back home to the Jungle Bunny Mountain where he feels  comfortable.  No.  Come on.  Yeah.  He's still up here, but you guys can talk him into it.  All right.  Let's get Earl on the trail.  Now watch.  The phone will instantly not work.  I know.  Not going. 
[00:54:00]  Earl.  Earl.  Not going.  What is the problem?  Not going.  Why, though?  It's a steep-ass mountain.  Why'd you go to the top?  How are you going to get down now?  I'll walk down.  I don't care.  He's going to walk down.  Earl, these guys want to get back to New York sometime tonight.  Earl, put the skis on and go down the mountain.  No.  I am not going down the mountain.  You go down.  You do your pie wedge.  Make your skis into the pie wedge so you go slow. 
[00:54:30]  What do you want on these skis?  We want Earl.  Yeah.  Little kids do it.  Do you see the little kids?  A poosah!  A poosah!  A poosah!  Don't be a fag.  A poosah!  What's wrong, Earl?  No, I'm not going down.  Why?  I'm not going down this mountain.  What kind of trail is it?  Is it a green, a blue, a black diamond?  Let's go.  What kind of trail is this?  A green trail.  It's a green trail. 
[00:55:00]  A green.  Oh, my God.  A green.  Pooosah!  Pooosah!  Oh!  Oh!  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Earl!  Earl!  Yes?  It's a green trail.  That's a piece of cake.  I don't care.  Are you freaked out?  Yes, I am.  Why?  Pooosah!  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, man.  Earl!  Earl!  You can't curse! 
[00:55:30]  Earl, stop the cursing.  I understand you're frightened.  There's no cursing in skiing.  Come on.  Earl!  Why are you cursing Ben out?  You can hear him in the background?  Okay!  Hey, hey, Earl, stop the cursing.  Earl!  Earl!  Calm down, Hope!  Earl!  Stop cursing!  Sorry.  City is never sitting.  Master got me working.  Sunday master set me free. 
[00:56:00]  Earl!  Yes?  Why are you getting so upset?  I thought you were going to take one for the team today and do some skiing.  Yeah, I've been doing one for 13 goddamn years.  Why are you getting so pissed?  Now he's mad.  Now he's getting mad.  Instead of doing nothing at work today, he gets to do nothing at a ski resort and he's pissed off. 
[00:56:30]  Shh, don't say that.  That's right.  I do nothing.  I do nothing.  Earl.  Yes?  What is the problem?  I don't want to go down.  Why?  I mean, I've taken, I've gone down the boarding trail twice and you're sticking me up on a hill.  It's a green.  It's a green.  Everyone does green.  Come on.  It's goddamn purple.  Watch out for, uh, watch out for hypertension, Earl.  Yeah, see what you're doing?  Getting yourself all riled up. 
[00:57:00]  You're a great.  Earl, hold on.  Stop with the F word.  My God.  Earl, stop.  We're running out of dump now.  And that line was really funny.  We're cakes for nothing.  Yeah, thanks for blowing one of our lines today, Earl.  Play it again.  You're a girl.  Howdy, faggot. 
[00:57:30]  Come on, Earl.  Throw yourself down the mountain.  I'm not.  Yeah.  Throw myself down the mountain.  And I got audio of Ski Patrol at the top of the mountain with Earl.  Oh.  Nigga, please.  Oh, my God.  Earl.  I'm the party pooper.  You're the party pooper.  That's right.  Don't be the party pooper.  Come on, Earl.  How are you going to get down this mountain, Earl?  I'll take the gondola, or it's been renamed the gondola, down. 
[00:58:00]  You can't take it down.  It's just got fired.  Is everyone just crowding around waiting for you to go down the mountain on your skin?  Yeah.  I'm afraid I'm busting my balls a little bit.  A little bit.  Here's Earl.  Screw you guys.  I'm going home.  Pussy.  Pussy.  Come on, Earl.  And where are the white women at?  I was told that this was an option, and I am exercising my option not to go down. 
[00:58:30]  Earl, it makes you sound like a wimp.  Yeah, don't be such a pussy.  No, you're not here.  I went right from the bunny trail to the Green Mountain the first time I went skiing.  And I could do the same thing.  I could vouch for Anthony.  I was there.  I was drunk.  The sun went down, and he still wasn't down the mountain.  Yes.  And we thought he died or broke his neck or something.  But I overcame the adversity and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:59:00]  Come on, Earl.  What?  Jeremy wants to say something, Earl?  Uh-oh.  You are fired.  Damn.  I could use the vacation.  Vacation from what, Earl?  They don't ask you to do much.  You're at the top of the mountain with your skis off.  You probably look ridiculous.  Yeah, really.  You got your big...  Oh!  Earl!  Earl!  Please.  Just what?  Did he curse again?  Don't curse.  Earl. 
[00:59:30]  Earl?  Yes?  Stop cursing.  Sorry, I get upset.  Ben is really enjoying this.  Ben, why don't you get on mic?  You seem to be enjoying this.  No, here's an idea.  Let's send Ben to learn to play basketball in Ben's style, okay?  It'll have the same effect.  And then I'll sit and laugh my ass off as boats whiz by your head as you shoot noobs.  Hey, that's racial profiling and stereotyping. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, we don't stand for that on this radio program.  Green trail.  No, that mic's not on.  Go to another one.  Yeah.  Ben, give her a little advice.  Why don't you say that this is like a white guy playing basketball in the ghetto?  Right?  Is that what I mean?  No, I'm saying send Ben to do something totally different.  Earl, stop being a pussy.  Put your skis on.  Go down the mountain.  You're paying to be there all day.  I'm not going down the damn mountain.  You're getting an appearance before you go down the mountain.  Don't be a wuss.  Ross, he probably wants to get some runs. 
[01:00:30]  He's sitting there waiting for you.  I was told it was an option to learn how to ski.  I learned how to ski.  I am not going down the mountain.  He sounds like such a puss.  Earl, do you know what?  They say about people that don't go down the mountain,  that just stand up there all day with their skis off as a retard.  I don't care.  Earl, you've got to go down the mountain.  The guys at the gondola are going to laugh their ass off if you go over and go,  please take me back down.  I don't feel like skiing.  I was going to say, please take my dead black ass down the mountain.  Earl, we have stopped the radio show. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  I got to call it like I see it.  You look kind of faggy.  Yeah.  They call me a fag.  We've got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  You stupid faggot.  Just go down the mountain.  I want to go down the mountain.  Put your skis on and go.  Earl.  Who are you?  I ain't calling you, lady.  Earl.  Earl, you're holding up everyone you're with. 
[01:01:30]  Those guys want to get runs.  Go down the mountain.  And Earl, don't worry.  Earl, you got the benefits.  I got the benefits.  Earl.  Uh-oh.  Earl.  Earl needs a vacation.  He's at an effing ski resort.  That's what Dominic is saying.  No S.  I don't know if Earl's there.  He's either giving us the silent treatment or he hung up.  Someone go check.  Our pal from New Orleans checking in, Tom. 
[01:02:00]  Tom, what's up?  Why wouldn't Earl do it, man?  I'd have done it.  I'd have even made my wife do it naked.  We know that.  What's wrong with him?  We know that, Tom.  Look, he's screwing me up.  Tell him I'll get live spots for him from Chuck's Chicken Shack down here.  Down here.  I will.  We're going to do a remote party.  You ribbed.  You ribbed.  I'm from the south.  My bad.  Why won't he do it, man? 
[01:02:30]  Really?  I don't know.  I'm just happy that we're out of New Orleans today.  It looks like Tom's awake.  Tom knows what we're doing on the show today.  That's a good sign for us.  You drink it, Billy.  Shut up.  What's up, redneck?  Shut up.  All right.  I think you're all hung up.  We got the WOW stickers coming in for everybody in New Orleans.  We got the WOW stickers.  Well, good.  I don't talk like that either.  I like hearing that.  And everybody, everybody. 
[01:03:00]  Everything seems to be in order on the board.  That's right.  Everybody come down to Temptations.  We got remotes every Wednesday for Whippin' Out Wednesday 5 to 8.  All right.  You know, the whole WOW thing is going to come.  It's going to be huge down here.  It's going to be huge.  See?  We need to know like three or four weeks before we pop it for everybody.  It's going to be huge down here.  So be patient.  Yeah.  You dumb, Rube.  Yeah.  I drink beer until I pass out.  Tom.  What?  And that voice calls Concrete Walkers. 
[01:03:30]  Concrete Walker?  Yeah, damn Concrete Walkers.  I like the way he talks about it.  Hey, we'll go grab us a beer.  A beer.  Are you ready to go get some beers?  Yeah.  When are you coming to New York to see us?  Well, I need to get up there, man.  You got some cold beers in the studio?  Yeah.  I'm going to bring my cooler.  What are you guys doing?  I drink beer until I pass out.  All right, Tom. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, I'm going to stop.  Temptations today and hopefully next Wednesday we'll have the stickers to give to everybody.  All right.  All right, Tom.  I have a couple of beers for you guys today.  Much obliged.  All right.  See you.  There he goes, Tom.  You sounded sober.  Tom from New Orleans.  He runs the station down in New Orleans.  Everything does seem to be in order here on the board.  God, that accent's killer, man.  Yeah, that's great.  God, that...  We lost Earl, though?  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  You know what?  I don't even know how that's done on the radio, but that's the visual of just picturing Earl  on top of the mountain.  With no skis on.  Just throwing a tantrum.  Yeah.  Because he takes everything so serious.  You know what's funny, too, when you ski?  You always love the jackass that's sitting there and he's got like three friends with him.  He's got his skis off.  Either he can't figure out how to put them on or he's afraid to go down and you come off the lift.  You're like, look at that clown.  And that's Earl.  And he probably sticks out, you know, today. 
[01:05:00]  What's Earl Moore frightened of?  Skiing or sex with a woman?  What thought frightens Earl Moore?  Looking down that mountain or looking into a clam?  God damn.  I think he just panicked.  He saw all white all around him and he didn't know how to handle it.  You know what it is, too?  Too much white around him.  Too much whitey?  It's horrible.  You know how many inner city people would love to get a day at a ski resort? 
[01:05:30]  Something they'd never, ever be able to do.  Earl should just do it for his peeps.  You know what I mean?  Representing.  And he goes up there and he just, he punks out.  Punks out.  We used to bring the black kids swimming in the summertime, huh, Long Island Ant?  What the hell are you talking about?  Who's we?  Who's we?  The church we belong to.  The Fresh Air Fund.  Yeah, we were part of that.  But, you know, they sent the black kids out to Long Island. 
[01:06:00]  We all had a little big party at the beach.  It was lovely.  I remember a commercial for the Fresh Air Fund when I was a kid.  And it used to be, they were talking to an inner city kid.  It's like, what would you do if you were out in the country?  I would grab a sheet.  I would find a farm.  I would grab a sheet and I'd play bullfight.  And they're just asking this kid what he would do.  And the best one, though, was the inner city kid going around this dim, dark apartment going,  Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.  Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. 
[01:06:30]  And all of a sudden, the camera pans down and there's a big friggin' rat eating out of the garbage.  And a little kid's going, Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.  And they go, You can send an inner city child to the country for a date.  Here, kitty, kitty.  It was in between lead paint PSAs that were being played on Channel 9 and Channel 5 here in New York.  Danny, what's up?  How you doing?  All right, bro.  I guess it's true what they say about the black folk.  They really don't like to go down. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, God, man.  Tell them that the Aryan Brotherhood from Mars was coming up on the next gondola.  From Mars.  See ya.  All right.  You stole that joke from Rich Voss.  Twisted people.  We're trying to get Earl on one last time.  It ain't gonna happen.  No, Earl is not gonna do this.  I just love how he gets so pissed off.  Like, we're asking him to do something serious.  Why on earth did he go?  We can't get him on?  No, he, uh, it rang, and then you know how when someone takes the cell phone, shuts it off, and you can tell? 
[01:07:30]  He just totally did that.  He knows we're calling him.  You know something?  If I was, uh, Budweiser, and I was the, uh, resort they're at, I would be so wicked pissed at, at Earl, because he, he's doing nothing to promote, uh, uh, that they brought him up there for nothing.  For no goddamn reason.  Make the effort.  I just love hearing him get pissed over nothing. 
[01:08:00]  Nothing.  Well, you go to Ben Stey and play basketball.  Why?  Is Earl doing that every week?  With bullets flying over your head.  The guy just totally stereotyped every, uh, hoops game that goes on in Brooklyn.  And, like, he's going there.  Like, he's, he's challenging Ben to do something he does.  You know, I won't ski, but you go and do something I do.  Yeah, you play basketball in, uh, in between gunfire.  He lives in Forest Hills.  I know, he lives in Forest Hills, Queens.  Lives amongst the white man. 
[01:08:30]  The Asian man.  Alright, we better take a little break.  He's used to being around the slopes.  I understand what the problem is.  Oh, my God.  I meant the ski slope.  Stop it.  Have we offended everyone yet today?  Working on it.  We are working on it.  Which means more PSAs we're going to have to play.  Oh, my God.  I like the comforting, coddling Steve, Steve voice on the PSA.  Please don't beat up Indians, Sikhs, or anyone else that looks like a terrorist. 
[01:09:00]  We're going to have to get Steve in to explain that next.  Yeah, but it's his, it's, uh, we call that the cancer read in the biz.  He's using the cancer read for the, uh, PSA.  I think, uh, management snuck one by us, Anthony.  They certainly did, but it didn't really, uh, go by under the radar.  I picked this thing up in a second.  Anytime I hear Steve, see, like, he gives a flying crap about anybody.  Alright, where is Steve, see?  Yeah, get Steve.  Well, here's the, we found.  It's very sincere.  We found, you know what he should have done?  Made up a name. 
[01:09:30]  Hi, I'm Bob.  Like, cause, it's Steve, but I know Steve.  We, uh, we obviously pissed off, uh...  The Indians.  The Indians?  The cowboy killing Indians or the other ones?  We make fun of everyone, but, uh, they, they, they're so pissed off, we have to run PSAs now?  You mean the casino owning woo-woo-woo Indians or the other ones?  No, no, no, the dot-head Indians.  Ah!  I can always tell when you guys piss somebody off, because I have to do one of those.  Yeah.  One of those PSAs.  Your voice in this is like...  Wait, we've played more of these?  Not in a while, not in a while. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, it's been a while.  This is the most recent one I can remember, but I've had to do these before as a, as what  I assume to be a direct result of people you pissed off.  What did we say?  I can't remember now.  Oh, my God.  Let's listen to Steve.  I love it.  Let's stop coddling the special interest groups.  Coddling, coddling, coddling, you're okay, it's okay.  Steve will tell you it's okay.  If you don't like the show, I'm just...  With his comforting voice.  Yeah.  Fag?  You should have used, you should have used the, you should have used the Steve C. Jim Hooters 
[01:10:30]  party voice.  Hey, don't beat up the Cs, Jim.  Can you get the clown music, Rick?  Yeah, let's hear it.  This calls for the clown music.  This is, this is a typical case of background or bed music completely changing the feel of  the PSA.  Should we play it first?  Yeah, here it is.  It's a completely dry read.  Yeah, here it is.  Let's listen.  During this time of national unity, we wanted to ask your help to stop the violence by Americans  against Americans.  Since 9-11, hundreds of Americans have been the victims of violent... 
[01:11:00]  Oh, you want to get Jimmy involved with this?  Yeah.  Yeah, like either one of us...  The team is back together.  You're tag teaming.  Either one of us gives a flying F.  Is that these people?  These people?  Who are these people?  For the New Cities, Steve, he gets together with his buddy Jimmy and they do cute little  reads for us here in New York.  They do those ads like a picture, Steve C. and then Jimmy going back and forth like,  hey, how about those Hooters wings? 
[01:11:30]  I'll race you there!  You know, those like faggot reads that are like that.  But now they're doing it to help out during this time of national...  They're fag buddies when it comes to the commercial world.  Yeah.  Let me get my shorts.  Let's go to Hooters.  Yeah.  Was that one of the lines?  No.  What was one of your lines for the Hooters read?  I think it was something like, hey, Jim, when I'm in a glory hole kneeling with my mouth  open.  Or something like that.  I might not be exactly right.  What was it?  Do you remember? 
[01:12:00]  I don't remember.  It was...  It was so bad because you're basically saying you're going to Hooters...  What are you going to do for the Super Bowl?  Yeah.  For the wings.  You guys are trying to convince everyone that you go to Hooters for the food and not for  the T&A that's all around you.  What about the girls?  But what about those wings?  That's what it was.  Yeah.  It was like that.  Yeah.  I remember Amber Ambrosia.  Yeah.  Ew.  Girls.  I like big man C in my face.  I like wiping the blue cheese all over my face.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  So here's Steve getting together with his buddy, Jim.  Yeah.  To take care of a problem, I guess, that Ant and I started.  Let's hear the rest of this.  During this time of national unity, we wanted to ask your help to stop the violence by Americans  against Americans.  Since 9-11, hundreds of Americans have been the victims of violent and deadly hate crimes  across the United States.  These crimes by Americans against Americans have occurred against innocent Muslim, Arab, 
[01:13:00]  South Asian, and Sikh men, women, and children simply because of the victim's religion or  outward appearance.  These vigilante crimes have orphaned children and ruined countless lives.  Attacking someone based on their religion, appearance, or nationality is just wrong.  It's dumb.  It is a crime.  And when you're caught, you'll do double the time.  Be a real hero.  President Bush asked us all not to give in to terror or fear.  Let's not let him down.  A message from the Indian American Center for Political Awareness. 
[01:13:30]  Don't let the president down!  He's counting on you!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Reading this stuff is like pulling teeth.  You're going to go to jail, and you're going to do double time.  And remember what our president said.  Double time?  Let's make him proud.  All right.  Well, here's the same PSA.  Now, notice this is a little...  I guess we're giving people a little lesson in radio production.  Yeah.  Here's the same read with a little bit of difference. 
[01:14:00]  There's background music to it.  And listen to how the mood of it changes.  Add a little music, and it's a whole different feel.  Right.  No, I don't like this one.  No, it's got to be the quick...  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, quick, fun music, like as if plates were being juggled, Rick.  That's what we're looking for.  It was the bed we used for the cancer read spot at that time.  That we got in huge, huge trouble for.  And that's all we'll say about that today.  I have in my hand the 60-second Hooters read. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, you got it?  Give it to him.  Hey, come here to find that music.  Here, can that mic reach?  We'll do it together.  Okay.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How come it's a female?  We didn't have a female voice to use.  Oh, it was supposed to be female?  So that's...  It would have worked better if it was a female.  It wouldn't.  Yeah, it would have.  Yeah.  Two guys kind of flirt with each other.  Well, then maybe that's why it sounded so gay, but...  All right, I'll start.  The action, the excitement, the crowds, the beers. 
[01:15:00]  Catch it all at Hooters.  Oh, and the big game, too.  Why go to sunny Florida and hang out on the beach or in the...  What does that say?  Or in the crush at the stadium when Hooters has the best season in town.  And when the team's away, the fans will play at Hooters.  We've got all kinds of great things to offer during this Super Bowl big week.  Oh, the super big week.  Sorry, I can't say Super Bowl.  Hooters' world-famous chicken wings, big, juicy burgers, all kinds of seafood.  Oh, let me just pop your C out of my mouth.  Yeah, that's great. 
[01:15:30]  Now, what about the beer?  We've got steak sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, shrimp, oyster roasts.  Why?  Why?  Speaking of seafood, how about a big C in my A?  Sounds fantastic.  Oh, and Hooters has our awesome roast beef sandwich.  That'll be great for the bigger appetites.  Bigger appetite like your big C?  Absolutely, Anthony.  Oh, and I almost forgot. 
[01:16:00]  All right, I've had enough.  What are these?  That's very funny, though.  And the way you two do it, it's like you've been butt buddies for years.  Oh, of course.  Of course, because we have.  All right, and we can't find the music to make our plan.  Oh, God damn it!  We'll try to find it, though.  Find it because it's a great little bit.  All right, and when we get back, why don't we talk to the girl that's going to get soaked down with blood.  We can do that.  With these huge super soakers and stuff as she tries to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[01:16:30]  Before break, though, we're going to the O&A archives, Ant.  Oh, what do we got?  Something off a little CD we put out a few years back.  Oh!  A little CD called Dementor World.  All right.  And we're working on another one.  Sure.  We got a couple big record companies that are very interested.  Oh, really?  You're going to treat us right this time around.  Sushi records?  No, it's big.  Actually, I ran into one of the guys at a sushi restaurant.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's not restaurant records, is it? 
[01:17:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  All right, which one is it?  Hi, Mom.  I'm in porno.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right, I hear you want to play Hi, Mom, I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Awesome.  Now, where does your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny?  Yes.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends meet,  so you jumped into porno. 
[01:17:30]  Okay.  All right, I got your mom's number.  I'm giving her the call right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi, can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay, hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job.  You had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yes?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great. 
[01:18:00]  It was, but things just fell apart.  I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to,  but I know I got a different job, but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies.  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  Well, I...  It's...  No.  It's too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  Um, I'll...  You, hold on.  Okay. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus, I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have, I have, like, three days to get out of here, so I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent.  No, you don't.  Where, where can I call you?  The same number, but, Mom? 
[01:19:00]  What?  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that...  You killed me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:30]  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really...  Okay.  I am going to kill you.  I love you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Make it touch her.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Boy.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027. 
[01:20:00]  Anywhere else, 866-2774-WOW.  Yeah, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  WOW's coming back very, very soon, Anthony.  I mean, it's happening, but, you know, we're going to really start focusing on it in another,  like, three or four weeks.  Yeah.  WOW is doing quite nicely on foundrymusic.com.  And there's a section called WOW Me.  Girls from all over the country wowing in their houses and in the middle of the woods.  Yeah.  All over the damn place.  So check that out on foundrymusic.com. 
[01:20:30]  He also has a video of what we were doing in the studio yesterday with that girl eating the lamb brain.  Yeah, that was pretty sick.  She made some great disgusted faces.  And I guess Ken is mad at us?  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  That's the line I'm getting.  Oops.  Yeah, that happens.  Weren't we making fun of Steve and how he goes into the serious mode to do some of his commercials? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  What was the big deal?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Apparently, as Rick put it, as Rick saw him in the hallway, he said he was yelling,  my God, this is the stupidest thing they've done yet.  Is that it, Rick?  Hey, we still got two hours left today.  Yeah, come on.  Let's put us some slack.  And I don't believe that is the stupidest thing we've done.  I think what we're about to do is going to be quite stupid.  Pretty stupid. 
[01:21:30]  Matter of fact, let's get the girl in here.  Yeah.  I'm having second thoughts about this one.  Second thoughts about this one.  I think it's going to be fun.  I feel like we should be playing like Sue Sue Studio in the background as we do this today.  Oh, yeah.  Like American Psycho.  Maybe get some rain jackets.  Yeah.  Put on the rain slicker.  The rain slickers.  That's where you walk outside the studio to completely soak a girl in blood.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  This is Sue Studio.  Phil Collins.  How you doing?  Just stare at it.  Eat it.  The color is bone.  The funk.  Punk, huh?  There you go.  She's wearing a punk shirt.  And she's...  Are you ready for this?  Are you?  Yeah, as ready as I'm going to get.  Yeah.  You're having second thoughts too, aren't you?  Not at all.  No?  No? 
[01:22:30]  Cool.  I'd rather be meeting that girl up there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other girl's going to be...  She's not just going to stare at it.  She is going to eat it.  Yeah.  She's going to be eating blood today because we...  She learned that we have to boil blood.  Boil.  So it's going to kind of turn into...  It's a kind of soupy...  Spiders.  Kind of like a soupy pudding.  Snails.  And puppy dog tails.  Eddie.  Eddie.  So what's your name?  Stacy.  And Stacy, where are you from? 
[01:23:00]  Pramus, New Jersey.  Nice.  Pramus.  She's a cute girl, huh?  Yeah.  Her little punk t-shirt on.  And a little short haircut.  Yeah.  There you go.  No, it looks good though.  Thank you.  You know?  And it doesn't look good when you're like 42 and you have that hairstyle.  How are you?  Exactly.  When you're young, you can pull off the short hair.  Yeah.  It looks perky.  Thank you.  And spunky.  When you get like...  On Lady Di, it looks mongoloid.  Well, it's an old bit that you and I and Jay talk about. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, when the woman in the relationship cuts her hair off at an older age.  Older age and she starts looking like your friend Bob.  Yeah.  Looking like a gym teacher.  Right.  I've seen this.  You go through a supermarket or something like that and you see a husband and, you know,  he's no prize either.  I'm not saying that.  He can have the gut working or whatnot.  Oh, we understand both sides.  Yeah.  But we're going to tell you one side.  We're just going to tell you the side about the woman who probably had the long hair 
[01:24:00]  he used to run his fingers through in the old days.  Looking real sexy and hot.  He used to go to a party and have some fun.  And something happens in her life and she decides she needs really short hair because  it just, it's just easier.  It's easier.  It feels good.  And she tells everyone that.  Hey, you know, it's just so much easier.  I am in and out of the shower.  Well, you know something?  You look like a man.  And as the women get older, I think they need the longer hair.  You know, you're pulling it off. 
[01:24:30]  Like I said, it looks very spunky.  You wake up when you wake up all of a sudden, you realize you're sleeping with Fred.  If the woman's hair is graying and you ever see the ones that just shave it almost where  it's very short on the sides, a little longer on top, and they got like that V thing going  in the back of the neck.  And I could see a guy rolling over looking at this, this short shaved gray hair lying  next to him if her back is to him and going, the back of that head looks just like the 
[01:25:00]  guy I used to work with on the dock.  You know, looks like the dock worker I used to work with.  The neck, the whole thing.  But something happens.  Something happens.  They just give up.  Go, eh.  Eh.  It's easier in the shower.  But you're young and you look great with it.  Seriously.  We're not talking about you today.  And it's going to be easier in the shower with all the blood that you're going to have  to wash out of it.  Yeah, I'm a little nervous about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to do it in like a few minutes here.  Is it true?  And I hate to bring this up now, but we didn't, we couldn't get lamb's blood, but Magic Johnson 
[01:25:30]  donated his own blood and we thank him for that.  So the blood is courtesy of Magic Johnson.  No?  Oh, I heard that.  All right.  I'm really psyched for this.  Yeah.  It's going to be fun.  Ebony, what's up?  Ebony.  Hello.  And I'm...  Hey, baby.  Ebony.  Hello?  She's right there.  You're right there.  I hear the phone moving. 
[01:26:00]  Black girl.  Hello?  Hi, baby.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's your name?  What's your name?  That's not Ebony.  Hello?  What's your name?  Just a second.  Hold on.  Just a second.  Oh.  They're on hold.  She's up at the top of the mountain.  They're all...  Yo?  I'm both looking down.  Yo?  Hello, hello, hello.  Hey, what's your name?  Hello?  Yeah.  What's your name?  I can't hear you.  Are the buttons right, Opie?  Everything's right on my...  Why can't you hear us, baby?  Hello?  Hello?  That's interesting. 
[01:26:30]  All right, hold on.  Put her on hold and try someone else.  See if it's our side.  Let me just try her again.  Ebony.  Hello?  Hey, baby.  I can't hear you.  What's up?  You hear us now, baby?  And your name's...  I hear you, baby.  No, we're not.  Your name's Ebony?  Yeah.  Nice.  So what's up today?  Nah, y'all was commenting on, like, earlier, how y'all was talking about how y'all see, like,  you know, y'all see us coming to y'all area and swim and stuff like that, but y'all  see us flying down the mountain like y'all idiots, because that's just not our thing.  That's not our thing.  I mean...  Hold on. 
[01:27:00]  Let me get my universal translator.  Let's do that.  Nah, I mean...  Y'all are flying down the mountain.  It's not my thing.  Oh, you're saying Whitey's crazy for skiing.  For skiing.  I got you now.  Whitey crazy for skiing.  Yeah.  No.  You know something?  I'll agree with you on that.  Skiing is a pretty dangerous goddamn thing to do.  I mean...  It's a recreation.  So you're on Earl's side.  You wouldn't go down the mountain.  Oh, hell yeah, I'm on his side.  I mean...  I mean, I guess we value our life more than y'all.  Y'all. 
[01:27:30]  Yup.  I think she digs me.  That means use guys, Anne.  Right.  Use guys, if you're in some parts of Brooklyn.  Yeah, you don't do that.  What do you do for fun?  Play basketball.  Hang out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  With the bullets flying over your head, like girl said?  Rob a white person.  Yeah.  I hear that basketball.  For saving and skiing, we don't put up a fight.  That basketball could be dangerous, Earl was telling us.  Nah, I mean...  That's just not our thing.  I mean, y'all just crazy, point blank.  Yeah.  Ain't no if, buts, and nays about it. 
[01:28:00]  I mean, y'all...  Where are you from, baby?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn in the high-ah.  What'd she say that you guys left in the mystery?  No if, buts, and nays about it.  No if, buts, and nays about it.  I mean, no.  No, I'm serious.  I used to hang out with white people at one time.  And I mean, we'd all be on a...  We'd be all cool, and then all of a sudden, we'd have to snap.  Go crazy.  I mean...  What's up with that?  I don't know.  No, it's hilarious.  In general, we do try to hang with each other.  And we're like, man, I just don't understand what you... 
[01:28:30]  Our culture is...  People are all about...  Our cultures are so different that it is very hard.  It's so funny to hear you talk.  I used to hang out with whitey, and man, I just didn't get it.  That was whack.  That was whack.  Whitey is whack.  Whack.  What did whitey do that was kind of silly when you used to hang out with whitey?  It's all the ifs, there's, and buts.  I mean...  Like what?  I just put it like this.  Yeah.  We don't understand y'all.  Y'all don't understand us.  Yeah.  I mean, when a black person get upset, at least you'll know it.  They just start squealing on you. 
[01:29:00]  You know what I mean?  But a white person, I mean, they just snap.  You don't even know when they get in there.  One minute, one minute, and then they don't say nothing.  You don't know.  Yeah.  If you don't say, they just stand in there in my coat.  And they go, Billy, I can't take it anymore.  What the hell is your problem?  You know, this chick is so right, man.  I like this girl.  Ebony, you're all right.  You're right.  You're right.  Like I see, I work with a lot of people, you know, work with a lot of people on my job.  What do you do?  What do you do for a living?  No, I'm in school.  I'm still in school.  I'm just, I'm an internship with New York City Transit. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, yeah?  Let me try something.  Yeah, what's up, Elvis?  Ebony?  Uh-huh?  Do you make the cheddar?  No doubt.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  You get the benefits?  No doubt.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  But see, where we crash at is that a lot of us try to make it a career.  It's not a career.  It's just an in-and-out thing when you need quick cash.  North or South Korea?  Huh?  Oh, I thought you said Korea.  What's this in-and-out thing?  I mean, like, you need quick cash. 
[01:30:00]  What you going to do?  Um, get a job.  See, you don't see it like us.  What are you going to do?  Pick a white nigga up.  That's quick funds.  Let's stick a white nigga up.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's the best white nigga to hit?  What do they look like?  Nah, you go for the grandmas.  Smash their purse.  They be having mad loot.  They be having mad loot. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah?  Hey, I learned that with Grand Theft Auto 3.  Mad loot.  Yeah, you hit the grandmas.  All of a sudden, there's money all over the street.  So this girl speaks the truth.  Yeah?  I'm serious, though.  I don't know what they're doing.  You know, what they be doing.  I guess they be saving it or something.  They ain't got nothing to spend it on.  Stay at home, watch soap opera or so.  Dave's waiting for you to hit him over the heat.  No, baby.  How do you do it?  What do you use?  Knife?  Anything that I got.  And what do you do?  You go up to the old bag and say what?  Be like, don't even turn around. 
[01:31:00]  One time I used a bottle.  I ain't had nothing.  I just put it to her neck and I was like, give me your purse.  No problem.  Better take it.  I was like, no problem.  One time I just snatched it and ran.  She ain't going to chase me because she can't run.  Hey, do you mug black people, too?  Nah, only when I really, you know, I ain't got no white people.  Yeah.  I really need it.  But black people kick your ass, right?  No, they chase you.  Grandma chase you as old as she is.  Grandma, she'll take a shoe off and hit you with it.  Who are you? 
[01:31:30]  I ain't calling you, lady.  Well, she's being honest today, Anthony.  Wow.  Are you one of those hot bitches?  I wouldn't call myself that.  You got some junk in the trunk?  Nah, I wouldn't really say that.  I'm kind of heavy set.  I'm just cool to chill with.  You ever have a white guy?  Oh, hell no.  No?  I don't know a white guy rubbing up on me.  Boy, this is so odd, our differences in culture.  You don't like white people, like, rubbing up against you? 
[01:32:00]  I mean...  What's the problem with that?  First of all, they're not big enough.  Right.  We all know that.  Rub it in, bitch.  See, the black people...  The black people love that stereotype, Anthony.  Yeah.  Of course.  They have no problem with that stereotype.  I guess...  I guess...  Oh, hey, hold on.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah, that F word.  That F word, they don't seem to like.  I'm sorry.  Whitey's crazy.  They hear that F word, and they freak out.  Okay, okay.  I understand that.  Yeah.  Well, hold up, but they use a lot on the job. 
[01:32:30]  Well, yeah, but...  All right, so what were you saying?  All right, like I'm saying, you see a white, you know...  I mean, all right, not say white, but if you see a fat chick, that's just going to turn you off completely, right?  Most guys would say that.  Most likely.  So it's the same with us.  Well, with me.  You don't like the whitey.  Nah, I got to stick with my own color.  Yeah, you like, what, guys that you know ain't going to be around for a while, right?  No, I wouldn't say that. 
[01:33:00]  Like guys that might give you a crack in the face, right?  Oh, hell no.  Mid-stroke.  Oh, hell no.  That ain't happening to me.  Ebony, I got to ask you, the darker, the better?  Uh, not really.  Not necessarily.  I hear there's a little racism within the black community.  If you're a little lighter than the others, you know.  Yeah, I hear the lighter black people don't like the darker black people.  No, because...  We had this discussion on our show and they came out of the woodwork saying, yeah, that's the truth.  Nah, because my mother, she's mad light, but I came out dark like my pops. 
[01:33:30]  You're like your pops.  Yeah.  And how old were you when he left?  No, my pops are still around, baby.  You're 15 of us, all with the same mom and dad.  Wow.  Wow, look at that.  Called the Guinness Book of World Records.  So our niggas don't mess with us.  Wow.  How white is your mom?  She's from the South.  She's just light-skinned.  She got a little Cherokee and some kind of other Indian.  Yeah, all you black people say you got Indian in you.  Well, the majority of them do. 
[01:34:00]  I want to open up a mother effing casino.  I'm a Cherokee, mother effing.  I'm going to sell my own cigarettes.  You know why most of them...  Tax-free, mother effing.  On the real.  You know why most of them really do?  Why?  Because, like, when the white man came in and all of that, most of them, they went to, like, the Indian camps to stay out of slavery.  They ran away and they would join in with the Indians and stuff like that.  Learn your history, baby.  I'm an Indian, B.  I'm an Indian.  Don't be taking me back to the slave camp.  And then, see, not only that, it's that they got more respect from the Indians, you know? 
[01:34:30]  Well, of course.  You was all niggas back then.  Holler.  Yeah.  I'm proud to be a nigger.  That's the history, man.  That was how the white man felt about the situation.  But, see, it's okay for a colored person to call me a nigger, but when a white person calls me a nigger, it's something else.  You know what I mean?  I hear that.  Like if a black person, a white person woke up to you and called me a nigger, you know, I'd get offended.  I'd probably thump on him.  Oh, yeah.  Same thing like if a black person woke up to you and be like, hey, yo, cracker. 
[01:35:00]  I don't care.  I don't care about that.  I would just, I wouldn't be able to hear it because I'd be running so quickly away from him.  Right.  I'd be running so fast I wouldn't even hear it.  I would be running to try to find a policeman.  Honey, have you learned yet the police is never there when you need them?  They're there when we need them.  I got to go find myself a policeman.  I would have.  You need them.  They're never there when you don't want to pull over.  Just like that.  I hear you.  Actually, in a lot of the projects, when the cops show up to bust the drug dealers, they give the cops crap. 
[01:35:30]  And then all of a sudden, the big, you know, a big fat mama will come out of the house and say, why the police ain't here when my child get killed?  But then every time they show up, they're throwing stuff off the roofs at them.  What the hell's up with that?  No, you see, when the police do show up, all they do is harass.  We'll tell you the truth.  They harass.  They're arresting criminals. 
[01:36:00]  When they show up, somebody calls them.  There's a crime going on.  We only need them for one thing.  I say for the females, they really only need the cops for one thing.  It's when her nigga beat her.  If she ain't got the guts to stab them, then, hey, she going to call the police.  This chick is wrong, man.  She ain't got the guts to stab them.  What is that in the relationship sometimes?  Black guys like beating up the women sometimes.  No, I guess it's most likely if you let them, then they do it.  Although, I will also say, if you watch cops down south, man, the white guys love beating their women down there. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, hell no.  The day a white man beat me, I'll be in jail.  Really?  That's why I would never go down south.  No?  Nah, because I heard, like, in certain parts of down south, there's a lot of prejudice stuff going on.  Get out of here.  I thought we were all over that.  I wish.  I can't deal with that, because as soon as a white person say, hey, nigga, I'm going to shoot your ass.  I'm going to shoot your ass.  Hey, how close do you live to Martin Luther King Boulevard? 
[01:37:00]  Well, I live in East New York.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  They don't have one in the area?  Nah, not really.  That's a nice neighborhood.  I've been thinking of moving there.  I was staying there.  I've been thinking of leaving Bay Ridge and going over to East New York.  Yeah, it's one last minute, baby.  One last minute.  I'd read the sign that says, East New York.  Hold on.  Joe wants in on this.  Joe. 
[01:37:30]  Yo, Joe, what's up?  Here's me.  Welcome to East New York.  What's up, Joe?  What's up, my newbie and queen?  I think, man, you can bring some street credibility to the show.  Holla, baby.  Have you ever heard of old, dirty, what is his name?  Old, dirty Dominican, whatever his name is.  I don't too care for him.  You don't listen to the show?  I listen to it sometimes.  You know by listening to him, he ain't got no street credibility, baby.  Why listen to us when there's Hot 97?  Yeah, let me shout my block.  Let me shout my block. 
[01:38:00]  Yo, you ever been mocked up?  Say what?  You ever been mocked up?  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  It's like going to elementary school.  Well, it was me and my cousin, we was rolling, and police came up to call a little marijuana.  You know, for the stupid stuff.  How much time do you get for that?  Practically nothing.  What's up with that?  And wasn't you related to Jason Williams?  I wish.  I got caught with a tech nine.  They said I tried to rob somebody, but I just, like, slapped him in the face with it, 
[01:38:30]  and he threw his jacket at me, right?  Right.  I get chased from Elizabeth down in Jersey City.  I get ten charges put on me.  What?  Nineteen years old, I get ten years sentence.  But, dude, you hit him with a machine gun.  I'm not kidding.  Yeah, but it wasn't loaded.  What?  I wasn't going to shoot him.  It wasn't loaded.  I wanted to scare him a little bit.  You know what I'm saying?  I was going to try.  I don't know.  You know how you chased from Elizabeth.  Opie, who am I to say?  The guy's got a point.  Yeah, but how about Jason Williams?  He blew the man's head off.  Well, Jason Williams got a lot of money. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, well.  You don't, baby.  Yeah.  He's a celebrity.  Yeah, I guess so, man.  Yeah, man.  Hey, you guys, teach us a few new words, man.  My cheddar's getting a little old.  I need something new.  That's old.  I know what a hoopty is.  I know cheddar.  That's old school.  I know.  What else did there?  How about trig-nology?  Don't get fooled by the white man.  Trig-nology?  Trig-nology, yeah.  Why do they call it that?  Well, you know, you get white men telling you one thing in the paper, and as you know,  they're lying to you.  It's the conspiracy, right? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, like a conspiracy.  Yeah.  Trig-nology.  You know that is right.  You guys are crazy.  We don't have enough time to worry about that.  We're trying to survive our own damn self.  Oh, there you go.  I've been semen since I've been swimming in my daddy's big yam bag.  Right, the yam bag.  Yeah.  Yo, listen, I got to run.  I say yam bag while I'm living.  Do you mean literally you got to run?  What, are the cops coming?  Right.  Nah, I just got to go.  Hey, Ebony, real fast, give us one word.  Leave us with a new word.  Damn. 
[01:40:00]  Most of the words y'all probably already know.  Yaki, yaki.  That's a new word, yaki.  Yaki?  Yeah, that's, you know, that's the braids the Dubian queens put in their hair because they bought  a head.  Because they bought a head.  Yo, yo, you know, I wanted to know, I wanted to ask Ebony, when you fight, how do y'all  as newbie and queens hold on to each other's hair?  It's so short.  I mean, the hair on my legs is long.  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, the problem with me, I guess, is that I'm more  masculine than I'm feminine.  I'm like a tomboy.  I hang out with me and all that.  Hey, hey, hold on.  When you fight, you take, do you fight, you put Vaseline and take up Vaseline on your face? 
[01:40:30]  No, that was one of those spaghetti girls.  When they fight, they grab each other hair.  And me, I just go straight B with the fist.  Yeah, because I saw a fight yesterday and all they did was held their head, you know what  I'm saying?  She didn't have that yaki in there.  Well, yaki is like horses, right?  She didn't have that yaki in there.  That yaki.  I'm fighting a girl grab my hand and just eat her food.  You going what?  You going what?  What?  Eat her food.  Stab her.  You going to stab her?  Yep.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Eat her food? 
[01:41:00]  Hold on.  Slow down.  That's there.  We learned something.  What did you say, Ebony?  Stabbing her.  That's old.  Eat her food?  Yeah, that's old.  You eat her food.  You slice her face.  That's old.  Oh, jeez.  I never heard of it.  So let's do it.  Eat her food, Anthony.  It's new to Whitey.  It's new to me, too.  Hey, yo, check it out.  Hey, I need some of those wild sounds because I want to change the WIC signs from my neighborhood  into wild.  The WIC signs?  Yeah.  I'm trying to convert everybody from WIC to wild. 
[01:41:30]  Wait, Ebony's going to say something.  That won't last in the hood.  What won't last in the hood?  Because right next to the precinct, you've seen the cops put a little wild stickers around  and they just snap another sticker on top of that one.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I be in the Bronx a lot.  My moms live right in 138.  I think everyone knows they and I are very cop friendly.  Yeah.  Right?  Like, I be next to the 40th precinct.  You see mad cops cars with the wild sticker right on the hood.  Yeah.  Right there.  But, like, when they, like, put, I think it was one time, it was like a big time. 
[01:42:00]  If I may say, the cops is my niggas.  Y'all niggas, not ours.  Anyway, like I was saying.  Wow.  It was like a wild sticker, like, big, right on the wall.  And they slap another sticker on it.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  They don't laugh.  Ebony, do you know Mongoose?  What the hell is that?  Mongoose sells the crack.  Oh, Mongo.  Oh, Mongo.  Hello?  Mongo in Newark.  Oh, he sells the crack.  In Newark.  We met him yesterday.  Yeah, hello?  I don't even know if I knew it.  Yo, what happened?  What's up?  You're there, Joe.  Oh, I thought somebody, I thought you hung up on me. 
[01:42:30]  Mm-mm.  Oh, someone's hanging up.  Ebony, you gone?  Say what?  All right, we're going to let you go.  Yeah.  All right, I got to go anyway, so y'all be safe.  Y'all take care, all right?  Yeah.  Later.  Ebony, Ebony, call us back.  Hello?  I'll drive, drive.  Yeah.  All right.  Joe, we're going to let you go, too, all right?  All right.  Oh, now, let me ask you something, right?  Yeah.  Hey, I'm out.  I'm trying to get this.  I'm out, eh?  It's going to be quick.  I'm trying to get this program together with you.  You ask us whatever you want.  In Newark, they got this guns for cash program, right? 
[01:43:00]  And they say no questions asked.  If we can get all the listeners to give me, like, a whole bunch of guns, like a box, I'll  walk in there myself with it and see if they block me up or if they're going to give  me the cash.  I mean, like, a whole box.  They say no questions asked.  I'll do it.  You know what I mean?  I'll go in there.  I want to see the look in their faces when I walk in there with a bunch of tech knives and  I think you better stay away from guns, Joe.  Hey, Joe, as they say in the hood, slow it out, slow it out. 
[01:43:30]  The commercials say no questions asked, cash.  Yeah.  So you want us to have a little fundraiser and get everyone to give their guns to us?  Yeah, they don't have to be no real expensive.  We'll put them in a big box and you're going to walk into the prison.  Yeah, I want to see if they got enough money in there to pay me for it.  I mean, I'll make the money back to the station.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Or either my bell if they lock me up.  Oh, but you know who this is?  I just recognized the voice.  Huh?  It's Jason Williams.  He just wants the guns because he wants the guns.  I got caught with a .357 before with a scope on it and he asked me if I thought I was a Terminator. 
[01:44:00]  Put it in my stomach.  What the hell can you do with a scope on a .357?  Oh, it was beautiful.  It was nickel-plated with a big scope on it, long.  You're watching too many movies, man.  I'm not watching no movies.  I could mail you my rap sheet.  You got a fax machine?  As a matter of fact, I got off parole in May, and the day that I got off parole, that's  when I went clean.  You know what?  If we give you a fax number, could you fax us your rap sheet?  Yes, I will.  And we'll read it on the air. 
[01:44:30]  Hold on.  Rick, and leave a number so we can call you back.  It's just between us and you, all right?  Don't hang up yet, Joe.  Hold on.  That will be hilarious.  I want to hear that.  Wow.  First of all, I just want to explain to people what that was.  That was Opie and Anthony's tribute to Black History Month here, the month of February,  just about over, but we figured it was time to really get into the mood.  To share the love.  To share the love between the white man and the black man, because I do believe that is  exactly things that maybe Martin Luther King was all about.  Holy Jesus Palomino. 
[01:45:00]  Eat her food?  I eat her food.  That means you stab her?  You stab her.  You cut her face, Opie.  Cut her face.  Eat her food.  What else we learned there?  Eat her food was good?  I learned that I am even more petrified than I originally was.  Wow, that's something.  See if you can teach them a few new words, like English.  I understood what they were saying.  Of course.  It's not about them.  It's not about us.  It's about the lovely lady in the studio, Anthony. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I know.  Sorry about that.  We got a little sidetracked for Black History Month.  So when we get back, she's going to try to qualify for the 55-gallon drop challenge.  Are you psyched for this?  We're going to pull out our gats.  Your what?  We're going to pull out our gats.  Yeah, we're going to look real cool after that phone call.  And rat-a-tat and buck, buck, buck.  Holding our four-foot super soakers.  Big, colorful, plastic weaponry.  Bunch of fags.  Yo, man.  And I picked up a plasma rifle in a 40-watt range. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  We don't have many spots left in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah.  First prize is $2,000, Anthony.  Two grand.  Two grand.  So, all right.  We're going to do it after the commercials, all right?  Cool.  Cool.  We super soak her with blood next, Anthony.  Also, really fast, too.  Hooters, tomorrow night, right after the show.  You know the deal if you're in New York.  We're going to hang out with our listeners.  And Scott Farrell's coming down.  And the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest is coming up from Washington. 
[01:46:30]  She'll be here for the show tomorrow.  And then she'll join us at Hooters downstairs.  That's 56 between 7th and Broadway, right at 7 o'clock tomorrow night.  Okay?  Cool.  And as we go to break, let's check out the F.U. line and see if anything's going on today.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the O.P. Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to all these people out there who want to be called by the T.C. terms.  Shut up.  Midgets are midgets.  You're not dwarfs.  You're midgets. 
[01:47:00]  Siamese twins.  That's what you are.  You're not conjoined twins.  Shut the hell up already.  I'm sick and tired of hearing your crap.  Go to hell.  I'm sick of having to worry about.  Well, it's P.C. and your stupid feelings anyway.  You're a freak.  F*** yourself.  Next message.  I want to give a big F.U. to the city of Salt Lake, Utah, 3.2B, whatever you want to call it.  We would add to the Olympics.  Just figured you guys might bend the rules a little bit and get some real beer in that state 
[01:47:30]  when you got half a million people hanging out watching the games.  Bye-bye.  Next message.  Hi.  This message is from my lawyer.  I really want to thank you for not showing up to my court case.  That really f***ing helped out a lot.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Unfortunately, you were arrested for fraud.  How could you show up to my court case?  What?  You with this part?  You f***ing, f***ing, f***ing, piece of s***.  F*** you.  End of message.  People running around like crazy, Anthony. 
[01:48:00]  Setting up for the next little segment, I guess.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Stacy?  Stacy's going to try to qualify for the 55 Gallon Drum Challenge.  We're running out of spots.  We've got four girls that are in.  I think we're going for four more.  And that will be it, Ann.  That's it.  And today she has agreed to get super-soaked with blood. 
[01:48:30]  With blood.  We've got the super-soakers.  We've got a gallon of blood.  We're going to fill up the guns in minutes.  She will be in brown panties.  I hear she's got dark brown panties on, though.  I was hoping for, like, white or a very light color that the blood would really show up on good.  Yeah, I don't think she was thinking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  White brown panties would have been much more gooder. 
[01:49:00]  Much more gooder.  Much more gooder.  Sheila, what's up?  I'm sorry.  I know you guys are off black history, but I am fuming, and I rushed home for this.  What's the matter?  Okay, I listen to your stereotypical jokes, and I think they're funny, because I think they pertain to a certain type of black people.  Yeah.  But I think you guys are like the news.  Why do you have to find, like, the most ignorant black people to put on the radio?  Which now I think you don't, because I don't think I'm that type.  Like, I don't rob people, and I don't have turkey in my family, but I am 100% black. 
[01:49:30]  Right.  And I don't say gooder, and y'all.  That's good.  We say gooder.  No, we just throw everybody on the air and see how it works out.  No, because I listen to you guys every single day, and from the day you guys started, and most of the, all the people, basically, almost all, that you've had on there are like,  What's up, y'all?  Hey, we from the hood.  And it's not, that's not mainstream black.  Sheila, you're not being fair, though, because I guarantee people are trying to call right now that have been on our show, and they're black.  Oh, I got to listen, I don't know, more often or something, but next time you get Ebony on the show, if you could take my number, 
[01:50:00]  I'd love to get on the line with her, because I do not want to hear her represent us as being those stick-up whitey, we're Cherokee,  I'd be doing this, be that, be you, and say birthday, okay?  Hold on, Sheila, something's going on outside the studio.  Yes, Stinky?  Test shot looked great.  Test shot looked great with the blood?  Yeah.  On the tarp?  On the tarp.  All right.  Sheila, we hear you.  Don't do any more test shots, though.  We need all the blood.  I think we put a lot of dumb white guys on the air, too, you know. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, well, okay.  Sheila, the truth of the matter is, the girl called up, we put her on the air, you know, we're not...  No, but you've had girls on the air before that, in the same way.  That's all that we're doing, is plopping down the phone.  When anyone calls up, we plunk down the phone, and then they speak like they speak,  they talk about what they want to talk about, just like you.  Okay, but for the record, I'd like to say on behalf of my black people, that we don't all talk like that,  and we don't all act like that.  Sheila, I think you would have to be a retard to believe that. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, I think that's a given.  That that was an example of the black community.  All right, I just know that you guys make jokes, and they are funny,  but when you put someone on there like that to actually validate your jokes?  No, no.  Sheila, this is the reality of it.  We could talk to you for another ten minutes, but then every single person that's listening to us will turn the dial.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I know.  I understand what you're saying, but it's like, who cares?  As far as what Ant and I are trying to do, you know, in afternoons, we're trying to entertain a little bit.  It's kind of interesting when she's talking about shooting. 
[01:51:30]  So, of course, if we have the choice between talking to you or some gangster from the hood,  some female gangster from the hood, I think, you know, taking a call from a female gangster is going to be pretty interesting radio.  Female funner.  Okay.  More funner.  All right.  You know, but we understand, and I think everyone else understands.  All right, I hope so.  All right.  Love you guys.  All right.  Bye.  Take it easy.  There goes Sheila, a little upset with Ebony.  I wonder if she was hot.  Rick, why do you have, like, a garbage bag on? 
[01:52:00]  Dude, we had the mics on outside the studio while we were trying to have a serious conversation,  and all we heard was, oh!  Well, I did a test shot?  Yeah.  Oh!  Looks good.  Wild.  Great.  Can't wait.  Awesome.  So you filled up the super soakers with the blood?  Got it all filled up.  Are they set to just the stream?  Stream.  No spray, no sprinkler thing.  I want a straight stream, quick blasts, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup,  on both guns?  Well, we only used one gun, because the one gun that the guy brought that he determined 
[01:52:30]  was the best one, the other one's leaked too much.  All right.  So we're going to have to wait a turn?  Yeah.  We want to kind of just go at it, man.  You sure not?  You sure another gun won't, uh?  Damn it.  Let me see what I can do.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  I've got to lay into it with two guns.  Oh, yeah.  Two gats.  Two guns.  More gooder.  Much more gooder.  Much more gooder.  Eh.  Uh, Mike, there's quite a crowd outside the studio.  Saying, Ebony will eat that bitch's food. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  That's when I can tell we're doing something, uh, very wrong, Anthony.  Yeah.  Is when the people start gathering outside the studio.  Yeah.  And they are gathering.  We are just going to, uh, cover this girl with super soakers with blood.  All right.  Rick's going to test another gun, I guess.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Hope he doesn't waste too much.  You know, Rick.  Gets a little overzealous sometimes.  Starts springing it around.  Now, let's go to Joe real fast. 
[01:53:30]  Joe, what's up?  Joe?  Hello.  Hello.  You're on the radio, Joe.  What's going down?  Not too much.  Couple quick things.  Uh, I know you guys got the whole busy thing with Magic Johnson's blood and all.  Yes.  It's going to be, uh, it's going to be hilarious.  But I think you guys got a new contest with the, with the brother that was just on.  Yeah.  With these tech nines and taking him down to the guns for cash.  That guy, you know what?  We just had Sheila on the phone, but that guy was hilarious.  I don't care.  Oh, it was funny. 
[01:54:00]  He was just funny.  I don't care what he does.  Hilarious.  I literally pulled off the road.  But I would have made an accident.  If you're just tuning in, he's like, I got an idea, guys.  I want to collect all the guns.  Or you guys collect all the guns.  And I'm going to put them in a big, huge box.  And I'm going to walk into the precinct.  Because they always say on the commercials, no questions asked.  Yeah.  No questions asked.  I'm going to go in there and see if no questions are asked.  Guy was dead serious.  He's, he's faxing us his rap sheet.  So, yeah.  He would do it.  I guarantee it.  And I'm calling from Cleveland. 
[01:54:30]  And I could have a gang of people to walk in with this guy just to see it and experience it.  Right on.  It would be absolutely hysterical.  All right.  All right.  You guys talk from Cleveland.  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  Take care.  Is it, is Rick testing another gun?  I hope so.  How long does this take?  Yeah, we got to do this.  I got a funnel.  I want to do this.  We take another break.  They're going to kill us.  I'm getting all psyched.  How close?  Within minutes.  Within minutes?  One minute.  One minute.  One minute.  And when we go outside.  Should we make our way outside?  Yeah.  All right.  You go out there. 
[01:55:00]  Grab your mic.  I'll, I'll hold down the fort here, Opie.  Make sure no one like Ebony or, or Joe burst in and try to steal our gas.  Boy, that was something.  Can you hear me on this mic?  Yeah.  Yeah, I hear you.  I need my headphone.  I hear you.  I'm going to come out there now.  Okay.  Can I do that yet?  Come on out.  Okay.  I'm going to do this. 
[01:55:30]  Rick, you look ridiculous.  Look at the spot the blood made, though, on the tarp that is camouflaging our green room.  I'm not touching it until the moment of truth.  Is this, which gun is this?  Did you test this one?  Yeah, I just tested that.  Don't tip it down too much.  All right, move.  Wear those gloves.  Well, by the way, Rick.  Let me glove up.  Oh, yes. 
[01:56:00]  Don't waste too much.  Dude, you got to check this out.  Is Steve filming this?  Yes, he is.  I see him to my left.  So this will be up on foundrymusic.com for you to check out later.  Hold on.  Don't drip.  I don't need messy blood.  Give me that goddamn thing.  And check this out.  Yeah.  Okay.  Let me try.  Oh, God.  This is going to be a mess.  This rocks.  Okay.  I am so sick.  You got like a tight stream and mine just splatters everywhere.  You got the shotgun blast. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Do another test shot with yours.  Okay.  Oh, God.  This looks so sick.  This is like a murder scene.  This is wrong.  We do have...  It's like Max Payne.  We got to play Susudio in the background.  Hey, watch that bloody tarp.  I don't want any blood on me.  I was blood dripping all over.  All right.  Why don't we...  Do we have Stacy?  We have a field mic today?  Yep.  Yeah, Stacy.  Go to Red.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Look what she's wearing. 
[01:57:00]  Why were you guys complaining about her outfit?  Wow.  Yeah.  A bronze panties.  It's black, but...  You are going to look like a murder victim.  You are going to look...  That's one thing.  Yeah.  Don't make this like a porn.  No mouth shots.  That's all.  Oh, no, no.  We want to...  All right.  We won't go for the little fair balloon game where we got to pump the balloon up by shooting  you in the mouth with blood.  That's terrible.  No, don't worry.  One more thing.  Everywhere else is fair game.  I don't think you guys are doing something.  Yeah.  Can you get that over with first?  Yeah, okay.  Oh, don't ask.  Wait.  It looks like there's nothing going on down there.  It's a little sheer down there, isn't it? 
[01:57:30]  All right.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Don't worry.  That's good.  It's a good thing.  I'm sticking.  I'm sticking.  Huh?  Can we have her stand?  She can stand however the hell she wants.  I am so digging this.  Opie, quick bursts.  Let this last.  How about we start with one shot at a time, okay, Anthony?  All right.  And then we'll have the grand finale.  Okay.  She's got pasty white skin.  You're very cute.  Oh, my God.  Don't say alabaster, Opie.  You don't say pasty white.  Pasty white is on the dead. 
[01:58:00]  I got the pasty white skin, though, too.  It's the middle of winter, you know.  Are we going to go for this?  We're going to take a shot at...  One shot.  One shot each.  One shot at the ground zero?  Yeah.  All right.  Who's going first?  I'll go first.  All right.  Go ahead.  Here we go.  All right.  Aim.  Fire.  I took out her right leg.  You took out her right leg.  Don't worry.  It's okay.  Get over there, Rex.  She's screaming.  What's wrong with the blood station?  It's got chunks in it. 
[01:58:30]  It's got chunks in it.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Red shirt.  Bullseye.  Bullseye.  The surgeon.  They call me the surgeon.  All right.  That was the money shot.  Go.  All right.  All right.  Now, she's really freaked out.  Now, she wants us to go fast, but we're doing this slow.  Yeah.  I'm going to try to take out the other leg.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  Look at that blood.  It's dripping down our leg.  It's like I'm going to miscarry. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  It's time.  I am going right for your belly button.  A little low.  Rick, get in there because we've got to get the sounds of fear.  There we go.  Bullseye.  The belly button.  I didn't see you.  And you're a good shot.  This is so much fun.  This is the real fear factory right here.  You look like someone has been hacking her with an axe, doesn't she?  Yeah.  This is real.  I wish Nord was here to confirm it.  Dude, this is really disturbing. 
[01:59:30]  Play Susudio, Ben, in the background.  Yeah.  We need Susudio.  All right.  I'm going to go for the belly tip.  All right.  Go ahead.  Put your hands to your side, Steve.  Oh.  All right.  I'm going to go right between the boobs.  All right.  It's going to splatter everywhere.  Oh, my God.  This is too much fun.  Uh-oh.  You might have to pump, Opie.  Pump.  Pump this.  You might have to pump.  All right.  Hey, could you turn around?  Yeah.  Turn around.  I'm going to go for your butt. 
[02:00:00]  Turn around.  It's getting sticky, isn't it?  She is very bloody from the waist down, Anthony.  I just unloaded about five shots on her butt.  Opie just did a shotgun blast to her back.  Oh, pump.  Yeah.  After he pumps, when you shoot, go a little further this way, because I think the spray  really got dangerously closed.  All right.  Okay, I'm going to go for the, uh, my, to my left boob. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  Not my left boob.  Her boob, but on my left.  All right.  She doesn't want it on her face.  Oh, I hit her in the belly.  Gut shot.  All right.  I'm going for, uh, I'll go for the boob.  All right.  Oh, God!  Oh, it's all over her chest and neck.  It exploded all over her.  Take a spit.  Stacey, how you doing?  I'm all right.  That arm is looking much too clean.  Hold on.  Let me, let me nail that arm. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  How about, I don't think she can take.  No!  No!  No, these are my good clothes.  I don't think she can take.  No.  I don't think.  Oh, wait.  She can't take too much more, so how about the grand finale?  All right.  Unload it.  Unload it.  Here we go.  Grand finale.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Oh, God.  All right.  I'm going to puke.  This is so disgusting and so wrong. 
[02:01:30]  Someone has to show responsibility around here.  This is so wrong.  Look at her, man.  Oh, my God.  Let me get out of here.  This is the wrongest thing we've ever done on radio.  Oh, my God.  Get her a towel.  Get her.  Let's clean her up.  Bravo.  You are in.  Thank you.  Stacey, how you feeling?  You know what?  It's not that bad. 
[02:02:00]  It smells kind of gross, but it's not that bad.  She is pretty much red from the neck down, Anthony.  It looks like she was hacked apart with an axe.  Bravo.  Well, there you go.  You have earned a shot in classic fashion, too.  Yeah.  What a great original idea.  This is unbelievable.  Bravo.  We're going to have to bring this to a road show.  Oh, imagine that.  Can you imagine doing this at a road show?  30,000 people, Anthony?  We just found a new thing to do at a road show.  Yes.  And imagine a lucky listener getting to come up and just pelt a girl with blood like that. 
[02:02:30]  Look, she's shaking.  She's shaking because the blood's all cold.  I drew a crowd, so I don't feel that bad.  Yeah.  You drew a big crowd.  Good job.  Let's hear it for Stacey.  All right.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, Steve filmed the whole damn thing.  You got some good video, right, Steve?  Anyone take snapshots for the website, too?  All right.  Go to foundrymusic.com later on tonight to see Stacey getting soaked with blood.  Hold on.  Don't go to commercial yet. 
[02:03:00]  Ann.  Yeah.  She had to do that.  She had to, like, flick her fingers at us.  Look at my pants.  I know.  Dude.  We got blood everywhere.  Look at my hands.  It was fun.  I was totally making sure.  I didn't get any on me.  And she did that, like, flicking her fingertips at us.  Right.  Like she was being funny.  Dude, you got two little droplets.  You see her?  Dude, look.  Yeah, but she's naked.  You know? 
[02:03:30]  Well, every contest with us has to end with nakedness.  Blood don't come out.  That's it.  You know what?  These were a pair of good pants.  You know, I think we say this every week, but, and we mean it every week.  That was the sickest thing we've ever done.  Yeah, that was pretty fun.  It was so wrong on so many levels.  When she starts screaming, because she's like, it's clumpy.  It's clumpy.  It was all, like, lumpy.  The blood was starting to coagulate, I guess.  The one blast to her chest was just so wrong.  It looked great. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, it went all up her neck and hit her chin.  We got all that on video, right?  Yeah, I hope.  Classic.  Well, we'll check out the video as we take a break.  Yeah.  Making sure that it came out okay.  Was Susudio playing?  Yeah.  I didn't have my headphones on.  Good.  Oh, yeah.  Susudio.  All right, we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll talk to Stacey.  She's cleaning up.  But she has definitely qualified for the 55-gallon jump challenge, Anthony, without a doubt, huh?  I'm in shock.  Let's go to the F.U. line. 
[02:04:30]  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  This is a big capital f***ing F, capital f***ing U to Nikki from Sacramento.  You f***ing guzzling bipolar Southern California Valley bimbo.  I can buy my own way to H.U. line.  I can buy my own way to H.U. line.  Bitch, a drunk Haitian wouldn't take you to Jamaica.  F*** you, Nikki.  Next message.  I don't want to leave a big f***ing U to all the homos that didn't vote for any of the girls from Philadelphia.  Taylor and Bobby were two of the hottest girls I've ever seen.  Taylor should have won this contest hands down. 
[02:05:00]  You guys are all homos.  Just go F*** yourself.  Next message.  Yes, Eddie from D.C.  Holy the big f*** you to all the little faggot-ass crybaby pussy little cities.  They're whining about Stephanie from D.C. winning the Naughtiest Nighty Contest.  You cities can go f*** yourself because you're nothing but a bunch of little bitches, and you voted for her.  What are you crying about it now?  Oh, boo, boo, shut up and take your medicine like a man.  F*** you. 
[02:05:30]  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  Stacey's cleaning up in the bathroom, Anthony.  I guess the blood was sticking all over.  Oh, was it? 
[02:06:00]  Hardening.  Hardening.  She says it was, uh, lumpy.  It was lumpy when it hit her.  I'll put it this way.  That was one of the top five things we've ever done.  Right, Ant?  Yes, it was the sickest thing.  And the video is great.  What's wrong, Ant?  I'm just seeing somebody, like, complaining for not letting them watch.  Dude, we videotaped the whole thing. 
[02:06:30]  It'll be on foundrymusic.com.  Well, they're bitching that we didn't have the stinky cam on, but you weren't going to be able to see much of anything.  No.  Plus, when we're outside the studio, we don't really hook up the stinky cam.  Don't worry about it.  You'll see it.  We got good old-fashioned video, and it'll be up on foundrymusic.com later tonight.  And we will take that little event there to a road show, that's for sure.  That's too much fun not to bring on a stage.  Imagine in front of 3,000 people, they'll lose their effing noise.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Classic.  We found another fun thing to do at a road show.  Yes.  Kind of itching for another road show, Ant.  I know.  We're getting some new stuff.  Kind of itching.  I like it.  Got to get the band back together.  Everyone's saying I'm whining.  I'm whining because I got some blood on me.  Well, you know, okay.  She looks like a murder victim, and you got a few dots on you.  I see it, Ant.  Yeah, I don't have many light pants.  I might have to call you out on this one. 
[02:07:30]  All right, you know, whatever, but I now know what I must do.  You got a couple droplets on you.  I see them.  She is going to get so abused in that barrel.  Remember, this is to be in the 55-gallon drum.  Yeah.  She's going to be, I'm going to take a personal interest in her torture in the barrel.  All right.  $2,000 up for grabs, by the way.  Yes.  That's why all these ladies are doing this.  A lot of ladies are trying to figure out why would any woman come down to go through this. 
[02:08:00]  Two grand.  Two grand.  And you know what?  Stacey had fun.  Is she available, or is she still cleaning up?  Is she cleaning up?  Yeah, she's still in the bathroom.  All I hear is water running and her scrubbing away.  Scrubbing.  Can you peek in and tell us what it looks like?  Because we even use the super soakers with water to try and hose her off.  It wasn't coming off.  Oh, my God.  It just stuck to you.  Hey, Rick, go to the bathroom with the mic and see what's going on.  Yeah, kind of get a little post-game interview. 
[02:08:30]  I want to see how hard it is to get it off of her.  How did O.J. do it so quick?  You know?  He stumbled in, hit the air conditioner, as I recall, dropped the glove.  Then he went into the house and cleaned up and met the limo driver for the ride to the airport to go to Chicago.  I wish O.J. was here.  He could give her tips.  What I like to use is palm olive and lava soap.  Hey, Joe. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, what's up, man?  We got your rap sheet, but we can't read it.  You can't read it?  No.  I bought the fax machine for two bags, so I didn't think it was that good.  For two bags?  Yeah, and a ride to the spot.  And a ride to the spot?  Yeah.  What's the spot?  It's not clear enough?  No, it's all smudged.  How about the newspaper clippings?  Can you read those?  What, you were in the newspaper?  Yeah, I sent you two newspaper clippings.  I didn't see those.  Tell me criminals save their press clippings.  Yeah, of course. 
[02:09:30]  Holy ass.  What did you do?  Can you read?  Well, I should stop right there.  Can you read one of the clippings?  Yeah, I got it right here.  Hold on.  I got some more papers.  I couldn't find them all, but I got the clippings.  Man, this is going to piss off the cops today.  Go ahead, Joe.  Let's hear you read your press clippings.  Read your clippings.  All right.  And tell us who you were.  Four Newark men have been charged after the robbing of an eight-ball jacket from an Elizabeth  teenager who was hit in the face with a submachine gun. 
[02:10:00]  Police said yesterday.  The suspect arrested in Jersey City Monday night after a high-speed chase were identified  as me, my age, and my address.  Oh, Jesus.  Three other co-defendants.  So you had your homies with you.  The victim was taken to the Elizabeth General Medical Center for treatment of a broken nose  and released.  The authorities asked the identity of a 17-year-old boy, his sister, and their companion not to  be revealed.  Elizabeth police detective, Lieutenant Jerome White, jackass, said deaths of the expensive 
[02:10:30]  leather jackets with a circle around it, a large number eight have become a trend in  New Jersey and New York City.  How old is this story?  I haven't seen an eight-ball jacket in a while.  Well, no.  See, I got that.  That's the man doing the trick on me.  I didn't go out there to rob nobody.  They threw that on me.  I mean, if you go down there and you smack somebody in the nose and they start throwing  things at you, I mean, he just threw it at us.  You know?  I didn't mean to take it from him.  He threw it at you.  He threw me his jewelry and everything. 
[02:11:00]  You just don't want your boys reading in the paper that you were trying to steal an eight-ball  jacket.  No.  You know, matter of fact, I had my own eight-ball jacket on at the time, so I didn't need that.  When he threw you the jacket and his jewelry, did you keep them?  No.  No.  The guys in the back seat were fighting over it.  Oh.  Oh, no.  This is mine.  This is mine.  So we got chased over the bridge in Jersey City.  We threw the gun, tried to throw it into the water, but it missed, and it fell into the  grass.  And they went back and found it. 
[02:11:30]  I was pissed off.  Stupid criminals on Fox.  My God.  Well, you did hit him in the face with a weapon, so what's the problem?  You got to identify that.  I mean, you got to know that you were going to get in trouble.  Yeah, but, well, it wasn't loaded.  I mean, I could have shot him.  It doesn't matter.  You can't even have the gun.  Yeah, but I could have shot him.  Jason Wins blew this guy's head off.  Why didn't you have bullets in it?  Well, actually, the clip was out of it.  We were driving over. 
[02:12:00]  We got over there so fast, we didn't put the bullets into the clip.  Where was the loaded clip?  It was in the car.  Oh, so you had the loaded clip very nearby.  We pulled the gun.  Everybody was jumping under their cars, and, oh, my God, it was funny.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, my God.  There is just a mindset that I do not understand.  When I got caught in Irvington with a .357 with the scope.  Did that make the paper?  Yeah, the seventh charge was taking part in Irvington's drug distribution ring.  But I wasn't part of that.  They just caught me with the gun. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, and what does it say about you and the gun?  It says, okay.  Do you highlight your part?  Oh, look, this is where they mention me?  Do you frame it for mommy?  Yeah, I highlight it in yellow.  It does have it highlighted.  I swear to God, I had no clue this went on, that they saved their press clippings.  Also, pleading innocent word, one of my buddies at Irvington, and the other held on $20,000 bail.  That was me, because I was a parole violator. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  And this was because you had the Magnum?  Yeah, because I had...  Well, actually, I had a .32, which was...  It wasn't fine, right?  It was broken.  But I got charged with both of them.  But the main one was a .357.  You know what's going to happen?  One day you're going to pull one of those unloaded or broken guns out, and someone's going to blow your friggin' head off.  I'm completely rehabilitated.  What do you do now?  Me?  Now I'm just hanging out.  Now I'm taking care of my mom.  You know, I came back to the projects and lived with her because she's not feeling too good. 
[02:13:30]  I mean, it's not too bad.  I mean, the rent is like $11.95.  I get to stack a lot of dough.  And, you know.  All right.  I listen to you guys, so, I mean, I can't be...  Well, there you go.  Hey, Joe, you don't know where we're located, right?  Not really, no.  Oh, good.  All right.  Oh, good.  We don't want you...  You don't want me over there.  They don't want you coming around with those guns that are misfiring.  How is it misfiring?  Was it just shooting to the right a little bit?  You know, the barrel, it didn't have the thing that held it in, so you have to, like... 
[02:14:00]  It's kind of scary if you hold it in there and it shoots and it pops up, you know, like backfires.  It was junk.  I had to throw it in the drawer.  I didn't care about that.  I would have turned that into guns for money if I had a chance.  Oh, my God.  I am stupefied.  Yeah, it's just...  I am completely...  He might as well be talking about how life on Mars is a typical day on Venus.  I have no clue.  Any more press clippings? 
[02:14:30]  Not...  Well, I got more.  I got to find them.  I got some, like, breaking down every single charge for my first one, but I got to find  those.  I can send those to you at another time.  Did you ever shoot anybody?  No, I tried.  One time, this kid kicked some dirty water on me.  Oh, wow.  I shot at him.  You got to shoot him.  He kicked dirty water on you?  Yeah, you know, after it rains, the water puddles up on the side.  A puddle?  Oh, but do you remember being in school, maybe, and you're walking next to somebody, and you  step in the puddle, and it splashes on him, and everyone laughs? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, you jump real hard.  Yeah, that's embarrassing, but, you know, the thing is that I had stuff in my pocket, and  it kind of messed it up.  Ah, well, then you got to shoot him.  You're right.  All right.  So you pulled out what kind of gun?  Well, you got to shoot him, man.  Back then, I think it was probably the .38.  That's when I just first got started hustling.  So you pulled out the .38.  You know, my first customers, I swear to God, you won't believe it, when I first started  selling, you know, the stuff, you remember Junkyard Dog, Coco Beware, and the British  Bulldogs?  Oh, of course.  They used to roll up to the projects. 
[02:15:30]  They were like one of my best customers.  They used to come up and buy.  I had the Iron Sheik, almost.  He wanted to get me a Hummer if I could find him some weed.  All right, Joe.  I swear to God.  This is where the radio host goes, allegedly.  Yeah, we have no idea.  Right.  This is your side of the story, and we invite those fine folks on who he is accused of such  things.  If the Iron Sheik wants to deny that he was pounding nails for weed, yeah, we invite them. 
[02:16:00]  He's more than welcome to call the show.  Yeah.  If he wants to deny that he was trying to pull the worm out of the ground like a robin does,  yeah, you know, he can come out and deny.  I think the Junkyard Dog is dead, so that proves part of my story.  Hey, dude, what happened when you shot that kid that splashed water on you?  How did you miss?  Well, he was running behind the cars and stuff.  Oh, so how many shots did you?  Well, man, you know, back then, it was like, you know, I had a pretty fancy reputation. 
[02:16:30]  They wouldn't call the cops on me or anything.  And was everyone running scared?  Not really, no, because I wasn't aiming at anybody else.  I was just going after him.  How many shots did you fire?  Two.  And what, they hit cars?  No, actually, I think they hit the bricks on the wall.  They didn't really hit anything else.  But he came back a couple of days and apologized.  Joe?  He apologized?  Yeah, he apologized, and I felt, you know, I felt kind of bad.  Joe?  Yeah.  Where did it all go wrong?  Yeah, what? 
[02:17:00]  Where did it all go wrong?  What happened?  Yeah.  Well, I dropped out of school.  Not high school.  Actually, you know, I got admitted into medical school.  Oh, yeah?  I went to medical school for like a week.  For a week?  Yeah, and I was, and I see, like.  To learn where the vital organs are so he can shoot at them.  No.  So, you know, I dropped out about after a week, because after I leave medical school, I come out,  I had a pretty nice car, and I see the girls, the girls,  the bitches, you know, dancing on the street.  I said, wait a minute, I can make money.  Why should I waste six years to make money when I can make money now? 
[02:17:30]  Ah, there you go.  Why waste six years in medical school when you can make money now?  Don't you think it's kind of called, I don't know, a career and living within the law?  I don't know.  It just seems like.  Yeah, but it's not fun back then.  You know, when you're like 18, 19 years old, you're not thinking about that.  You think about having fun.  I don't know.  My fun did not include shooting at people.  No, I mean, I never went out to kill anybody or anything.  I never, you know, it's just kind of like part of the game, I guess. 
[02:18:00]  My fun was getting a six-pack, going in the woods, drink a little bit.  Drink a little bit on the logs in the woods.  You make them into a little triangle with your buddies and put a fire in the middle.  I met a couple of white boys that hung out at the end.  Then go drinking down the tracks.  Maybe leave school after the sixth period and go to the ocean and swim.  Yeah, things like that.  Crazy fun.  Crazy fun.  All right, Joe.  Yeah, so you guys really wouldn't want me to hang out at Hooners with you, huh? 
[02:18:30]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Well, I think it's all filled up now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is this Hooners you speak of?  I'll wait until the end of the night and I'll go in and rob it as Mrs. B. so filled.  Oh, great.  I'm sure they love hearing that.  Yeah.  I'm just joking.  Yeah.  You can't come.  Sorry, you can't come.  Listen, I got this funny book I'm going to mail to you guys.  Oh, yeah?  What's the book?  I won't tell you, but it's got to do with, like, a newbie and queen, so. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  I'll mail it to you.  Yeah, Joe, I think we're canceling our appearance tomorrow.  I'm not going to show up.  I'm not going to go down there.  I'm going to New York, I hate going to New York.  Yeah.  Yeah, unless I can make some, can I get into that 55-gallon drum challenge?  I can use the two Gs.  I can scream like a bitch, too.  No, but we might be able to use your expertise during the challenge. 
[02:19:30]  All right, well, you got my number if you need my help with anything.  Any other DJs give you any beef, I might, you know.  Oh, well, you know, if they splash us with dirty water, you know, we'll call you.  You know, I got a question for you.  One question, who made up about that bit with the, what's in your pants?  Why do you like it?  I love that, but you know what, one day I was in a truck with one of my friends,  and he was going to work, and he was going to let me use his truck.  And I heard this other fact, DJ, I won't say his name, with the big nose. 
[02:20:00]  And he was doing the same thing.  Well, yeah.  And I said, wait a minute.  I said, this guy, I heard this before.  This is ONA.  Well, you know, don't, try not to shoot anyone over it.  Right.  All right?  Bust a cap in his ass.  Well, no, let's all be nice.  Right.  All right, let's talk.  You guys are cool, man.  Let's like a Joe angry, Anthony.  Right.  So let's move on and talk to Stacey.  Joe?  Yeah.  What's that, call waiting?  No, what is it?  I don't know.  All right.  All right, what, do you want me to hang up? 
[02:20:30]  No, we don't want you to hang up, but if you feel like you're done talking to us, we will let you go.  Yeah, well, I'll call you back maybe another day tomorrow or something.  Get rid of old, dirty, old, dirty Dominican.  I mean, what's the Dominican Republic?  All right.  What's their biggest export?  I don't know.  You've got backup infielders, Pedro Guerrero.  And molasses, I think.  And Felipe Lopez.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Joe, we're going to go.  Yeah.  We're all cool, right?  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  You don't have any problems with Ant and I, right?  No, I love you guys, man.  I go to hell and fight the devil for your soul.  Oh, well, just listen to the show.  You don't have to do anything, really.  Just listen, and if someone asks you what you're listening to, then I'll say Opie and Anthony.  Like I said, I'm trying to get street credibility for you guys.  I'm putting your name out there.  I think you helped us today with that.  Sure.  Well, you got my number.  Do you want to call me back in time?  Yeah.  Well, I think we're going to lose that number.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Well, I think we're going to lose that number.  Oh, shit.  How did you know I was messed up yesterday?  All right, Joe.  Listen, we got to go.  Yeah.  And I think you have to go as well, if you know what I mean.  All right.  Go find a kiddie pole to hide under.  I hear the cop car.  All right.  I hear the gravy train coming.  All right, Joe.  All right, Joe.  We got to go.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Take care, man. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  Woo.  Okay.  All right.  Stacy, how are you feeling?  I'm all right.  Oh, look at you.  You're all cleaned up.  Yeah.  Was it hard to get the blood off you?  I still have some a little bit.  Stacy, I got to tell you, for the first time, I felt bad.  It was really disturbing.  I was kind of sick to watch that blood just splatter all over you like that.  It was fun at first, and then it took a turn where I was really disturbed.  You know what?  The worst part was the back.  Really?  It was cold, yeah.  It was cold and clumpy, right?  Yeah, it was a little chunky. 
[02:22:30]  You were shaking.  Yeah, it got really cold.  Very cold.  Well, you know what?  That just taught us one thing.  Next time we do it, like at a live event, we're chilling at first.  We're actually putting it on ice.  Nice.  Put it in there, and that way we'll get a really good scream.  Did you have a problem getting it off?  It wasn't that bad.  Yeah.  It was just really gross.  Was it hard to get out of, let's just say, the nooks and crannies?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like you got some in your crack and stuff?  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  You asked.  I know.  That's cool.  That's great.  Well, you're in.  You are in.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Make your own jokes at home on that one.  Yeah.  Play the home game of Opie and Anthony.  Sure.  Sure.  We try not to state the obvious ones.  All right.  Maria's still ahead.  And what is Maria going to do?  She's the blood eater, drinker.  She wants to eat or drink, depending on what form it takes after it's been boiled.  Right. 
[02:23:30]  What kind of blood is it?  It's the pig blood.  It's pig blood.  Yeah.  I didn't have to ingest anything.  No.  You got a little in your mouth, though, didn't you?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, you kind of.  I heard I got some on you, too.  I'm sorry.  I really am aiming for you directly, just in your general direction.  If I first had thought I'd mention that, I'll be a friggin' whiner, so I won't even talk  about it.  Why don't you show her, uh, where she got you.  Look at what you did to my white pants.  Get a magnifying glass.  Right. 
[02:24:00]  See?  Look.  The pants are tan.  Hold on.  Let her, uh, look into the microscope.  See?  See?  And then some down here and there.  That is nothing.  And some there.  I got a little on my sneakers, but they're garbage.  All right.  Bridget.  Yeah.  What's up, Bridget?  Not much.  Uh, it sounds like you're calling in a car.  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm on 270 in Maryland.  All right.  And, uh, why are you calling? 
[02:24:30]  Uh, the 6 o'clock queef.  The 6 o'clock queef, Anthony.  Oh!  Are you going to pull over?  I would assume so.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  Why don't you start pulling over while we play the song, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Here's Bridget, everyone.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Throw out the candles, make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor. 
[02:25:00]  Text up and let yourself roar queef.  All right, Bridget.  Yeah.  Did you pull over?  Um, trying to.  Oh.  Trying to.  All right.  I'm sorry.  My boyfriend got a little anxious, so he called early.  This bit is all about timing, so pull over and we'll play the song again.  Okay, I'm sorry.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Throw out the candles, make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish. 
[02:25:30]  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor.  Text up and let yourself roar queef.  Bridget.  Yeah.  Are you pulled over?  I am pulled over.  Oh, good thing.  And are you ready?  I am ready.  You're all ready to go.  And your boyfriend's in the passenger seat?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, let's listen in and Bridget, go to town.  Let's listen. 
[02:26:00]  Did you hear that?  I don't know.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Throw out the candles, make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock, it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor. 
[02:26:30]  Text up and let yourself roar queef.  Well, there you go.  I don't know what that was, but it's the 6 o'clock week.  Okay, Huey.  Yes.  What's up, bro?  You've been waiting a long time, and I apologize.  You work for the NYPD or the fire department?  New City Fire Department.  And you got something going on?  Well, I figured I'd let you guys know that since you're going to be partying again in the  New York City area, we've got the police fire hockey game Saturday at Madison Square 
[02:27:00]  Garden.  Oh, that's always good.  You guys tear it up.  Yes, and if you have a party with the firemen and the cops, you know it's always a good  party.  How has that been over the past few years?  Who wins more?  Well, the cops have a lot of younger guys.  Yeah.  But lately, the fire department, well, a lot of tougher guys, I hate to say it.  I was a cop also.  You know the thing that sucks about the game?  What?  They're cutting off beer after the first period. 
[02:27:30]  They're worried about a melee at the garden.  It was in the paper.  No beer after the first period?  You cops and firemen know how to drink, man.  I'll tell you that.  I would love to go.  I hear you guys really go at it.  Well, you're going to fight the better in the stands.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, but you guys go at it right on the ice, too.  Well, yeah, they play serious, man.  Well, they got tough on that because they started suspending guys for the whole season.  Ah, come on.  They were in a regular league.  Right.  All right, so what's the details?  Is it Saturday at the Garden?  Yeah, 7.30 at the Garden. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  And we'll see what happens.  Are we doing a good thing with the money or what?  Well, the garden supposedly gave us a good break this year.  We usually have it at Nassau Coliseum.  Okay.  Money going to charity?  Well, usually before the 11th, everything always went to the widows and orphans.  Right.  Okay.  And it'll probably just be the same.  Okay, great.  Yeah, that makes sense.  All right.  Hey, we'll see you Saturday at the Garden, Huey. 
[02:28:30]  All right, guys.  Good luck to you guys.  All right.  Okay, cool.  Take care.  Why don't we take a break, eh?  All righty.  And what?  We're good.  What do you mean we're good?  We're good with Maria.  Double check some stuff.  We're good.  What does that mean?  I'll tell you.  We're good.  We're good, eh?  What?  What?  What?  What?  We're good.  You know.  Are you ready?  Opie and Anthony are going to touch you where it's dirty.  Take a look at the camp, okay?  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:29:00]  And EW.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to be hanging after the show tomorrow in New York City.  We're going down to Hooters.  First time we've been out in New York in a long time, man.  Yeah.  It feels right to do again, finally.  So after the show tomorrow, we're going to Hooters.  56 between 7th and Broadway. 
[02:29:30]  You know the place.  We do it sometime in time.  We're going to have some beers with the listeners, with you guys.  And we're going to bring Scott Farrell down there, our new morning guy.  We're just going to hang it.  We're going to hang it out.  We'll see who shows, and we'll get some stuff going on.  Yeah.  And the big news, we've got the Naughty Nighty winner coming from Washington to hang with us all day tomorrow.  She'll do the show with us, and then she'll head down to Hooters after the show.  We're talking about Stephanie from Washington.  Yes.  So be there, all right? 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Well, Rick is microwaving something.  We're going to try to qualify another girl for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  And quite frankly, enough with the stupid blood.  The blood thing is really catching on, this whole blood thing.  Well, let's get Rick in here and see where we're at.  Also, a lot of people, they need closure.  Closure?  They need closure when you listen to this show. 
[02:30:30]  What do we need closure for today?  I swear to you, a lot of people sending in instant feedback and calling on the phones, like Doug from Springfield here.  Everyone wants to know if Earl has made it down the mountain yet.  Oh, yeah.  I just found on the news they had a helicopter view of a frozen Shrek on top of a ski mountain.  Did his little mule make it down or no?  I don't think.  I don't know.  Can we call him?  Let's get Earl.  We need closure on the Earl Spring thing.  It's cold up here.  Now, if you're listening. 
[02:31:00]  Doug, how funny was that?  He sounded like the biggest wimp.  Yeah.  Doug?  Yeah.  It's just fun to have you ever seen when they take little kids two years old go down ski mountain.  I know.  And it was a green.  It was a green trail.  Green trail.  Yeah, which is just the easiest one.  Maybe it was better off because if he got hurt, it would look like Bosco poured on some white ice cream.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Doug.  Good win for the Islanders last night, Doug, by the way.  God damn.  Didn't get that in time.  He hates the Islanders.  Okay.  Earl, if you remember yesterday, he was talking about today he's going to go skiing. 
[02:31:30]  And we checked in with him earlier on the show.  He was on top of the mountain.  He had gone down the bunny trail.  He got on the ski lift, went up the mountain with everyone else that was involved with the station and Budweiser and the ski resort to go to the top of the mountain.  And all he had to do was put his skis on.  So we put them on hold while he put his skis on.  We punch him back up just in time for him to say, I am not going down this mountain.  There is no way I'm skiing. 
[02:32:00]  Everyone else had gone up in the gondola.  They'd made it to the top.  It was time to ski down.  And Earl hangs them all up.  Now, the rest of them are standing up there going, now what do we do?  Earl's got to walk down the friggin' mountain.  He took his skis off.  He got so pissed off.  You know how hard it is to walk down a mountain in your big clunky ski boots?  It's a pain in the ass.  Every once in a while you break a binding or something, you got to do it.  Oh, it's a nightmare.  It just blows.  It really is a nightmare.  You're sinking up to your knees in some parts and it just sucks. 
[02:32:30]  All right, Anthony, Tracy wants to try to qualify for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  All right.  Read the screen.  Yeah, I'm reading that.  Tracy, where are you from?  Originally, I'm from Georgia.  But where are you right now?  Between Maryland and Philly.  Oh, okay.  So you could drive up, right?  Yeah.  Oh, you sound like an African princess.  Oh, thank you.  I don't know about the princess part, but...  You're African?  Yeah.  I'm black.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  Nice.  Yeah, baby.  I guess you guys are listening to us, huh?  Oh, hell yeah.  You guys.  We got a lot of the African-American audience on our program.  Because we don't bother with that white music, right?  Oh, that's right.  Screw whitey, I say.  All right, so Tracy, what do you want to do to get in the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Remember, $2,000 up for grabs.  I know.  That's what I need.  I just totaled my $2,000 grand dam and my husband's very upset with me.  Wow.  You have a purpose then. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  You have a mission.  All right.  Why don't you tell everyone what you want to do?  Um, I'll drink a nice warm cup of curdled milk.  Have you ever done this before?  Uh, no.  You do know it would just make you instantly vomit.  Probably.  You would just puke in a second.  Oh, my God.  Better than blood, though.  Curdled milk.  How curdled can we get it?  Um, I don't know. 
[02:34:00]  I don't want to get too sick.  You're going to get sick no matter what.  Yeah, you're just going to, like, puke this up.  So you might as well just go for it.  Yeah, let's just go for it.  So we would take milk and, what, leave it out?  Yeah.  And let it sour?  Yeah.  And then pour the lumpy mess into a cup?  Oh, no.  I hope he's getting it.  And just warm it up in the microwave.  Like, you tip the carton over and it slowly trickles out and then one big lump goes. 
[02:34:30]  Holy ass.  You don't know if you should just swallow the hunk hole or chew it once?  Oh, okay.  All right, Rick, you bastard.  No, no, no.  I can't take any more of this.  Get away from me with that.  Get away from me.  Go ahead and swallow.  Get away from me.  Get away from me.  I only have a tiny piece of my soul left.  I have just a tiny bit of innocence left in my peeing.  I cannot do this to myself. 
[02:35:00]  Dude, no.  I'm not going to be able to watch this.  I might be nuked.  Rick just brought in a coffee mug brimming with pig blood that has been nuked and is just  now a coagulated, goopy, lumpy mess that is spoonable.  Let's just put it this way.  There is no fluid left.  No, it looks to me like...  Just imagine chocolate pudding and you know how the skin gets hard? 
[02:35:30]  Just imagine a whole cup full of...  Broken apart skin.  Right.  From pudding.  Pudding skin.  Tracy, when do you want to come down?  Friday?  Friday.  Okay.  Yeah.  Friday is the challenge, right?  No, no, no, no.  This is all the qualifying.  The sooner the better because we only have four spots left and we might be giving a girl  a spot in a few minutes here.  If you can make it tomorrow, it would be great.  If not, Friday will do. 
[02:36:00]  Sure.  I'll come tomorrow.  Are you sure?  We don't like when girls blow us off.  Oh, no.  I'm not going to blow you off.  All right, cool.  Hold on and talk to Stinky and Rick and work out the details.  If you can't make it tomorrow, we'll accept Friday, but try for tomorrow, all right?  Okay, thanks, guys.  You stop.  All right, there goes Tracy.  She's going to drink.  You know what?  We got to end this qualifying, man.  This is getting so wrong.  Rick, stop it.  Don't keep mixing it up.  Let me see.  I do have to see.  Gong!  Dude, that's not blood. 
[02:36:30]  It absolutely is.  That's blood?  Look at the color on the bottom of the spoon.  Turn the bottom of the spoon to oak.  See the red?  Look.  All right, stop.  It lumps up and coagulates like that.  That was totally liquid when you put it in.  That was all liquid.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Go ahead.  And it bubbled?  All liquid.  What did it do?  Um, it, like I pulled it out after a minute and the whole top had gotten like that thick,  thick skin across it.  Yeah.  But underneath it was still warm, so I had to heat it up for another two minutes. 
[02:37:00]  Oh.  Dude, I'm dry haven.  And no joke.  I didn't think this would get to me.  God.  Holy F.  All right.  Enough with the blood.  I'm done with blood.  You've been sticky.  What, stinking?  He just ran out.  Bring it.  Jesus.  Bring the cup over here, though.  I do have to see this.  You go around that way. 
[02:37:30]  Oh.  Dude, that looks like, that's not blood.  It's blood.  It is blood.  It is brown.  That's what happens to it.  It, it looks like, uh, chocolate, Ant.  Yeah, like.  Like, clumps of, uh, melted chocolate.  If you squished a lot of, a lot of, uh, Hershey's kisses, uh, kisses.  You know what, you're sick, though?  Mushed them down, and, and they were in little pieces, and you throw it in, threw it in a cup.  It also looks a little like, um, just barely moist soil. 
[02:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  But I know what it is.  It's friggin' blood.  Bring her in.  Oh, God.  Stop, dude.  Get it away.  Go over there.  Over that mic.  Right there, Rick.  Oh.  All right.  Bring her in.  There's no way she's gonna do this.  And if she does, you better get a garbage pail, because she is booting.  Hey.  Oh, look at the face she just made.  Get the stinky cam on.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get the stinky cam on for this one, because it's in studio. 
[02:38:30]  Don't move.  Don't do anything.  Hey, what's your name?  We'll interview you.  Don't, don't look at it.  Yeah, don't look.  Maria?  Maria.  And where are you from?  Staten Island.  Staten Island, representing Anthony.  All right.  Um.  You really think you could do this?  Yeah, I'll do it.  You belong in the dump in Staten Island.  You'll do it?  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  You really want to be in the 55-gallon jump challenge, right?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  She's up on the stinky cam.  How much does she have to do, Anthony?  I, I, I'm thinking we need, uh, three, three scoops.  There's no way.  I'm thinking one, one is, there's no way she's doing three.  One is bad, and then you get past it, right?  Damn it.  I don't want to see this.  I swear to you, I don't want to see this.  What did I do wrong?  One is bad.  Why?  But then the anticipation of the second one is really bad. 
[02:39:30]  And then knowing you got through that, and there's still one more left, awful.  Well, we got to be fair.  How many scoops did the girl yesterday do?  Two.  Three.  She did three.  She did three.  That's why I'm saying three.  The third one as, as the encore, Rick.  A two is required.  Oh, I spilled some.  Hey, hey, clean that up.  Maria, you, you, you're a cute girl.  Why?  You need money?  A cute girl?  Well, you're cute and stuff.  Pick up that blood.  You all right? 
[02:40:00]  You can't even look at it, Ant.  There's no way this is happening.  Mike, get me some stuff here.  You see it?  Well, pick it up.  What does it look like to you?  Oh.  It's a, it looks like soil you would pick up from Arizona.  Oh, God.  What does it look like?  Two little.  Hold on, hold on.  That's terminology we can't use here.  It does.  He asked me what does it look like to you.  Don't say it, though.  Don't say it.  We understand it does look like crap.  You know what?  It does look like that.  You're right.  It looks like crap. 
[02:40:30]  You're right.  You, you tend to use the, uh, you use, use the other word for it, but, um, crap.  Yes.  All right.  Uh.  Well, um.  Why wait?  Let's, let's see how this goes.  Yeah.  Do you want to move that mic to the side a little?  Because it's interrupting with the stinky cam and her mouth.  Because that's what we want.  And we're putting Fear Factory, uh, to shame.  Fear Factory.  Uh, Fear Factory to, Fear Factory's a man, Fear Factory's a show.  So, I really need to sleep. 
[02:41:00]  Sleep.  Okay, um, are you ready for spoonful number one?  Get a good one.  This is for your chance to sit in the barrel.  For your chance to win $2,000 in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Okay, she's got a scoop, man.  She's got a heaping helping.  A lumpy scoop of blood.  Is the garbage pail around?  There's no, there's no hint of fluid.  Ben's not looking.  There's no hint of fluid in this blood. 
[02:41:30]  No, no, there's not.  I'm going to have to chew it, right?  Oh, you could, you could do anything you want with it.  Chew it.  You rock for saying that on the radio.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're allowed to chew the blood.  I bet once it's moisturized a little, if she stuck a tongue out, it would be red like blood.  Uh, wait, wait.  Uh, before Marie, um, uh, takes the first, uh, spoonful, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think Mike's going to help her out a little bit.  I wish I, I could say this myself, but Mike came up with it.  So, Mike.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Why don't you say what you have to say?  That's not blood.  That's liquid scab. 
[02:42:00]  Oh.  Okay.  You've got a spoonful of scab.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You're, but he's right.  It, it most certainly is.  You know, don't think about what Mike just said.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a hemoglobin sprownie.  Hemoglobin.  Hemoglobin.  All right.  She's, uh, psyching herself up.  This is part of it. 
[02:42:30]  You know, you've got to psych yourself up a bit, which is good.  She's looking at it.  Here she goes.  She's, uh.  That's a really big spoonful of blood.  All right.  She's cutting her mouth.  She's chewing the blood.  She's making lots of faces.  She's, her eyes are watering.  She's, she's doing really good, Anthony.  She's chewing really well.  And, uh.  She might.  No, she's shaking her head.  Come on.  Keep going.  She's.  She, she has.  She has swallowed the spoonful of blood.  Oh, she swallowed a spoonful.  There's one down.  What did it taste like? 
[02:43:00]  She still has some in her mouth.  No, she's still chewing.  She doesn't want to talk, Anthony.  Yeah.  She's, uh.  Oh, okay.  Now it's starting to, it's starting to be a problem.  She's.  Oh, now it looks like it's okay, right?  This thing's chewy.  It's so chewy.  It's chewy.  It's chewy, yeah.  What's the flavor like?  If you could, uh, relate it to anything you've eaten before.  Nothing?  It tastes like nothing you've eaten in your life?  She doesn't want to, uh, tell you what it tastes like, Anthony. 
[02:43:30]  That was the head movement she was, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  The first spoonful's down.  There it is.  She's not moving.  She's concentrating.  She's going to be okay.  Are you going to be okay?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be fine.  Oh.  You're okay?  Oh, she's going to cry.  Okay.  Is it good?  There's no crying and blood eating.  Yeah, that's a good, uh, spoonful.  Here comes spoonful number two.  As she.  Second time.  She psyched herself up. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, there it is.  Okay, the second spoonful is in.  Easier or harder than the first?  She's not talking.  Yeah.  Oh, she just gave you the look of death, Anthony.  I got it.  She stopped chewing to give you that look.  I agree.  Yeah.  That look only women can give.  Oh, there's some great pictures up on the stinky cam.  She's chewing.  I think this might have been too easy, Anthony.  Well, no.  You want to try?  Yeah.  See?  No. 
[02:44:30]  How you doing?  The second spoonful is not going down as well, eh?  Well, it's taking a little while.  A lot of people commenting on the, uh, instant feedback.  Uh, they're looking along with us on the stinky cam saying, uh, first of all, she's too  cute to be put through this.  Yeah.  So you have your fans out there, which is nice.  Yeah.  Uh, she looks like she's going to hurl.  There's another thing.  Okay, done.  And Kevin from the Bronx says, why is her shirt on? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, she just had her first dry heave.  Did ya?  Was that a dry heave?  You okay?  What was that?  Was that a dry heave or just kind of a...  Did you go like...  No?  You're okay.  I'm okay.  She bounced forward a little though.  Open your mouth.  Oh, God.  All right.  Ah, we're going to talk.  Here it comes.  This is the third, uh, spoonful and this is for a spot in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Here it is.  A big heaping spoonful of blood.  Or as Mike says, scabs. 
[02:45:30]  Ground up scab.  It's a scab burger.  It's like a veggie burger.  It's like moist.  Moist.  It's hot.  Yes, it's been nuked.  Yeah, we nuked it.  For your safety.  You can't eat that.  You can't eat that cold.  That would be disgusting.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, here we go.  That's good.  Here she goes.  Wow, she's a trooper.  She got a good one.  Scoop.  She got herself a good one.  Yeah, she's not trying to, uh...  She's not pussying out.  Cop out. 
[02:46:00]  And it's...  There she goes.  ...in.  Wow, what's wrong with the third scoop?  You're making some bad faces there.  Too much thinking.  At the scabs.  No, I think it's going down pretty easy.  No?  Is it any good?  No.  Is it any good?  But she's chewing it.  I think she's going to be in the 55-gallon challenge.  Yeah, I don't think she's going to hurl either.  Even if she hurls, she's in.  We're just hoping she hurls, because it makes better radio, let's be honest. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  Hurling always good.  No, she seems to have, uh...  Uh-oh, she shook.  She shook violently.  What was that about?  She's got the shakes.  She doesn't want to talk yet.  She's focusing at the job at hand, which is to swallow.  Yeah.  Well...  Okay, done.  Yeah, there it is.  Get her some water or something.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Well...  Is your tongue red?  Let me see.  No, it's...  It's brown?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Opie, if you look at the, um, stinky cam, right at the last minute, I freeze-framed, 
[02:47:00]  uh, the picture that will remain up there now.  And what's that?  Let me take a look.  If, uh, Ben can go to it.  That's a great picture.  That pretty much says it all.  Marie, you're in the 55-gallon challenge.  You are in, eating three big spoonfuls of coagulated, uh, blood.  We qualified two girls today.  Uh, someone that's coming...  Uh, Tracy's coming down tomorrow to drink curdled...  Yeah.  Milk. 
[02:47:30]  That's...  That's great.  You alright?  Alright.  She doesn't have a talk.  So, we'll...  We'll check in with her next, and we'll also play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Stay there.  Boobs.  Wah-wah-wah-wah.  Boobs.  Let...  Let...  Let...  Let them hang.  Wow.  Boo-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.  Let them hang like the animals they are.  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  Yeah, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[02:48:00]  Before we play What Do We Learn, we are going to get our closure.  Ladies and gentlemen, Black Earl.  Earl.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm good.  A little queasy, but good.  Queasy?  Why are you queasy?  God.  Why am I queasy?  Yeah, why are you queasy?  I'm not queasy.  The pills I take, they kind of kick my ass every once in a while. 
[02:48:30]  What pills are you taking?  The antibiotics that I've been taking for the last three months.  You're radio gold, I swear.  So you're a little queasy.  Earl, we learned earlier you went skiing, you went up on the gondola to the top of one of the Green Mountains,  one of the Beginner Mountains, after you conquered the Bunny Trail.  You got off of the gondola.  I hardly conquered the Bunny Trail.  Well, you got off the gondola with the rest of the people in your party, 
[02:49:00]  and then live on our airwaves here, you, well, I got to say it, Earl,  you push it out and refused to go down the mountain on your skis.  Earl.  I was nowhere near ready to go down a mountain.  Earl, what's harder for you, learning how to ski or Father's Day?  Oh.  So, Earl. 
[02:49:30]  Earl.  Hello.  Hey, how you doing, Earl?  Hello.  So, how did you get down?  Yeah, that's what it was.  How did you get down the mountain?  Um, I took the gondola back down the mountain.  You, so you made the guy, because I, you know, little known fact, Dan, I do a lot of skiing.  Yeah.  The guy at the top of the hill doesn't want to be bothered with stopping the damn thing,  because he has to stop the whole gondola so the guy can walk up and get on the gondola going down. 
[02:50:00]  And then everyone's looking at the idiot going down the mountain on the gondola,  and everyone laughs at you.  Were people laughing at you, Earl?  No.  And, personally, I really don't care.  I really don't.  Now, why wouldn't you go skiing, try it out?  I wasn't ready to go down the mountain.  It's just as simple as that.  All right.  I guess that's our closure.  That's pretty much it. 
[02:50:30]  I want to think, the people at Morgan Creek, though, were terrific.  Oh, they were?  Where were they?  Why?  Yeah, they were great.  Why, they held your hand?  They treated us great.  Yeah.  They were extremely patient with me, as they were trying to teach me how to ski.  They gave you a shoulder to cry on?  No shoulder to cry on.  I wasn't crying, but I wasn't ready to go down the mountain.  Yeah, an extra tear packs for you.  Were you feeling any water weight gain?  Did you need a pamperin and a rag? 
[02:51:00]  Earl, comment?  No, I have no comment.  I'm just, I just want to say, I hope that management, oh, stop it.  I hope that management and the fine folks at Budweiser are as eager and as enthusiastic to...  How to hang up on.  Earl, call back.  Your phone crapped out.  Yeah, that was it.  No, it really did that time stink.  The phone.  Yeah.  Anthony, what did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  You learned anything today, Ant?  Uh, what did I learn?  I learned, uh, what blood looks like after you nuke it.  Wow, I learned that too.  Yeah.  It's not pretty.  I really did learn something today.  Yeah.  Uh, that, uh, criminals, uh, keep their press clippings.  Oh, I learned that, yeah.  I had no clue.  We learned a lot about, uh, street crime today.  Tuttle from New York.  Today I learned, uh, that Opie used to imagine being Lara Croft driving into work.  Faggot.  Big Josh from the city. 
[02:52:00]  I learned a few things.  There ain't no cursing in skiing.  And black guys can't ski, but black girls can eat your lunch.  Old grannies got mad loot.  I learned that too.  Jersey Gary.  Uh, he learned Earl, uh, looked like a Tootsie Roll stuck in a pile of flour on the ski mountain.  It's all about closure.  Line of the day.  It's a tie today, Anthony.  Ants screw whitey and hopes there's no fluid left.  You also learned that a fax machine is worth two bags and Earl lives next to the slopes, 
[02:52:30]  but he's never been skiing.  Jerry from Edison.  Uh, what a bloody mess.  I learned today, Opie hopes I am picky.  Legs is whole.  Sheep lover.  I learned today, Opie, uh, got introduced to Pot by the Wallace brothers.  Yeah.  And then he writes, Opie, this is Pot.  Pot, this is Opie.  So, tomorrow the, uh, qualifying continues for the 55 Gallon Drum Challenge.  Oh, yeah.  We're running out of spots. 
[02:53:00]  Uh, Rick just gave me the list.  We got six, uh, contestants in.  We're looking for two more.  That's it.  That is it.  That's it.  And Tracy's coming down tomorrow to drink curdled milk.  Oh, now she can do it Friday?  Oh, boy.  We got to save her a spot.  Got to save her a spot.  We promised her.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  Chris, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned there's, uh, no crying and blood eating.  Yeah.  No crying at all.  Very good, bro.  And blood eating. 
[02:53:30]  You suck.  All right.  Uh, Lisa, what did you learn today?  I learned to stop listening to you guys while I'm eating dinner because this is the second  time you freaks made me puke.  Yeah, you should have learned that earlier.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is a good diet, though.  Oh, thanks.  You guys suck.  It's the Opie and Anthony diet plan.  You guys suck.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I also want to thank Stacy for allowing us to shoot blood all over.  That was fun.  Wait till you see the video on foundrymusic.com later tonight. 
[02:54:00]  Wait till we take that one on the road.  Yes.  Do that live.  Yes.  And if you missed it, we got to play the audio tomorrow because it was, it was sick.  All right.  I guess that's about it.  Eh, this is kind of funny.  Another Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, today I learned the Iron Sheik pounds nails for weed.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  And a salt with a Mac 10, it's okay if it ain't loaded.  Right.  And you have to warm the blood.  Eating cold blood would be disgusting.  Hey, you know, I bet if it was a black trail, Earl would have done it. 
[02:54:30]  I don't think there are black diamonds over there, are there?  No.  All right.  Hey, listen, guys.  You got to remind everybody.  Watch for the wow sticker tonight.  Yes.  On the job.  All right.  Later, guys.  930 ABC, I believe it is.  Yes.  Later, guys.  Hope so.  All right.  New York number 11.  Nah, well, you already did that joke.  Oh, yeah.  You got to know when to say when, Rick.  Cheekies.  Rick.  Number nine.  Number nine.  Nine.  Nah.  The white shorts joke has been pounded into the ground many, many times. 
[02:55:00]  How old is that?  We'll talk about your George Foreman grill.  Or me and the pumpkin patch.  Oh, don't worry.  October will roll around.  Relax, Mr. Furcoat.  Okay, Mr. Moose.  How's Dreamweaver?  I saw that picture.  What?  Over Rick's house.  What?  The one with you with your head in the moose cutout.  Dude, it is the funniest goddamn thing I said to Rick.  I go, why isn't this on our website? 
[02:55:30]  When was that taken?  I guess a couple years ago.  How did you get it?  I don't even remember taking it.  I don't know, but it is so funny.  It's your face in a big moose cutout, and there's Opie smiling.  Big moose antlers.  Dude.  Him and Sandy.  Dude.  They're a flock of moosen.  We're going to play Let's Make a Deal, my friend.  All right, we're outie.  Yeah, let's go.  As they say in the hood, Ant.  You're right.  Oh, real fast.  Today's blood was donated by Magic Johnson. </pre>
