<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a self-aware introduction acknowledging their history of controversial content and run-ins with the FCC. The main focus then shifted to a list of America's top restaurants, which, surprisingly, included fast-food chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, and Burger King.  Opie and Anthony engaged in a humorous and crude debate about whether these establishments truly qualified as "restaurants," employing their signature irreverent style. This segment devolved into a discussion about the generally poor quality of food at chain restaurants such as Red Lobster and Sizzler, with anecdotes shared about small portions and questionable food preparation methods.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a segment on "meat glue," a food industry practice of binding together scraps of meat to create larger cuts. The hosts reacted with varying degrees of disgust and surprise after viewing a video detailing the process and its potential health implications.  

The show concluded with a brief discussion of the hockey playoffs, specifically a Flyers-Sabres game, where one host recounted jinxing goaltender Ryan Miller with a tweet.  They also briefly commented on Lindsay Lohan's recent, surprisingly well-received appearance on Jay Leno, finding the standing ovation she received ironic considering her past legal and substance abuse troubles. No guests appeared in studio during this broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  Yeah, the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fucking have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hola.  I don't know how we should start the show every day.  I think like that.  Because that means nothing.  I think just like that.  Just like that?  Yeah.  Talk to imaginary people out there.  We say, hello, good morning. 
[00:01:30]  And they go, hi.  You think they're on their cars?  Hi.  And then the serial killer just looks up.  Yeah.  In the middle of sawing some fucking Craigslist prostitute in half.  Looks up at the radio and goes, oh, good morning to you, Opie and Anthony.  And then right back to the sawing.  Chavis, you going to go to that restaurant and get me some coffee?  Restaurant.  We were just having a little discussion here.  The restaurant thing will not die because they came up with the top restaurants in America list today. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And I guess we started this yesterday because McDonald's likes to call itself a restaurant.  A restaurant.  And man, the listeners certainly had a good time with that, coming up with things that make you not a restaurant.  Yeah, reasons why they're not a restaurant.  And then it continues today because a list came out, top restaurants in America.  And Starbucks, that great restaurant, Starbucks.  Oh, boy, it's fantastic.  Is what, number three on the list? 
[00:02:30]  Try the pasta.  Try the pasta.  Yeah, they have pasta.  How the fuck is Starbucks a restaurant?  It's great.  Just because they serve delicious treats.  Little cakey.  Cakey and coffee.  Well, they serve hot, like, breakfast sandwiches until they run out.  No.  No, that's the problem with Starbucks.  I could certainly help that company.  The fucking...  Restaurant.  No, when someone is ordering a stupid egg sandwich, it slows down the coffee line. 
[00:03:00]  And 99% of the people are going in there for a quick cup of coffee or a coffee drink.  And then you get an asshole that decides he needs an egg sandwich.  And they can't figure out how to make them fast enough.  So you sit there like, what the fuck?  They're good, though.  You're not a Starbucks guy, right?  No.  No, no.  Does it slow down everything when someone orders one of those dumb egg sandwiches?  I tend to see the line slow down a bit, yeah.  Yeah.  So you're going to go to that fine restaurant and give me another coffee?  I'm going to go get them some restaurant coffee. 
[00:03:30]  Go get them some coffee.  Do we have a reservation?  I don't know.  I'll call and see if they have anything on there.  Call ahead, because, yeah, you'll never get a table.  If Starbucks is a restaurant, wouldn't that make 7-Eleven and Dunkin' Donuts restaurants?  There you go.  It's pretty much the same crap.  Hi, I'd like to make a reservation for Starbucks at Saturday night.  Where does Dorcia fit in there?  Is that a...  Kumia, table for two?  Your lattes are ready. 
[00:04:00]  Why is Starbucks a restaurant?  Because they offer free wine.  The restaurant definition is becoming a little loose.  What's the criteria for defining a restaurant?  Yeah.  And who made the top five?  I bet you there's not one restaurant in the top five restaurants in America.  Well, McDonald's restaurant is number one.  That's not a restaurant.  Damn right it's not.  McDonald's.  McDonald's.  Down there drinking milkshakes, I'll tell you that, Mark.  Subway restaurant is number two.  Look, Subway restaurant. 
[00:04:30]  I know we sort of did this yesterday, but any place where they don't trust you enough to allow you to pay after you eat is not a restaurant.  That pretty much should be the defining...  That might be the number one, right?  Yeah.  Wait, who was number two?  Subway restaurant.  Subway.  Subway restaurant.  Restaurant.  That's not a restaurant.  You want number four?  Three was Starbucks.  Yeah, three is Starbucks restaurant.  The fine restaurant of Starbucks.  Four is Burger King restaurant.  Restaurant. 
[00:05:00]  That's not a restaurant.  A restaurant where you can get a cardboard crown, put it on your head.  Right.  That's a good restaurant right there.  Is this, does this go past five?  I'm not sure.  I don't think so.  Well, is five at least a restaurant?  Yeah.  Okay, what?  I mean, this is a restaurant list.  Yeah.  Five is Wendy's restaurant.  That's not a restaurant.  Restaurant.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  Does it keep going or not?  No, but I think we can probably find the full list.  This is just an article. 
[00:05:30]  Where's the Taco Bell restaurant?  Oh, Taco Bell restaurant.  It's got to be up there.  I mean, that's a good restaurant.  It's got to be in there with, you know.  Yeah.  Hang on.  Yeah.  That's great.  Let's see.  I've got to just get rid of a fucking asshole.  Restaurant.  See you later.  Shane.  See you later, douchebag.  It's not me.  He's talking about it.  Bye-bye.  All right, so go to Starbucks restaurant and get us some coffee.  You want something from the restaurant? 
[00:06:00]  They got flaky.  Yeah.  No, you want cakey, not flaky, right?  No, actually, I would like the lasagna.  Okay.  Can I get that?  That's pretty heavy for breakfast.  Why don't you just have them make you like a nice hot stack of waffles or pancakes or something?  Oh, that's it.  Okay, yeah.  Can I get like, oh, you know what?  Get me French toast, right?  Mm-hmm.  And some sausage.  Well, you can get those at Burger King restaurant or McDonald's restaurant, but I don't know if you can get them at a Starbucks restaurant.  Oh, oh, that's right.  I can. 
[00:06:30]  Mm, Starbucks restaurant, though.  Oh, hang on.  I may have found that.  How about steak and eggs?  Sure, why not?  You can get like a steak and egg McGriddle or something.  What are you looking at now?  Oh, you might have found past top five.  I didn't.  We don't really need to keep going with this.  It's obvious that the definition for restaurant is very loose these days.  It's pretty loose.  It's pretty loosey-goosey.  Where does the M&M's store rank on that list?  Yeah, the M&M's store restaurant. 
[00:07:00]  What would be the first real restaurant, do you think, that makes that list?  Like a TGIF?  Probably something like that.  An Olive Garden?  An Olive Garden.  Like a TGIF.  Outback Steakhouse.  Outback.  Outback.  Those are restaurants, right?  Which barely fit in as a restaurant, but they're chain restaurants.  But you have a waitress or a waiter or a wait person.  That should be it.  Somebody's got to come over to you and take your order.  They ask you if you want something to drink, and then they disappear for a few minutes.  That's a restaurant.  They sell booze if you want to get a drink or a glass of wine. 
[00:07:30]  That's part of the criteria.  You're right.  If your food comes in shitty paper, it's not a restaurant.  You want fucking cardboard or styrofoam.  Right.  Okay.  Well, I have last year's restaurant list.  Do you want last year's?  We can just do like the top ten?  Yeah.  I just want to see where the first restaurant is.  Okay.  Well, Taco Bell restaurant was number six.  Dunkin' Donuts, Pizza Hut, KFC.  Applebee's is number ten.  All right.  Now, Applebee's does fit the criteria of a restaurant.  Then you got Sonic.  No, Pizza Hut is a restaurant. 
[00:08:00]  No, Pizza Hut.  They have Pizza Huts inside of Target.  It's not a restaurant.  Yeah.  But can't you sit down at a Pizza Hut?  Some of them.  Some of them.  So they're almost a restaurant.  Almost.  Let's give Pizza Hut almost a restaurant.  Almost.  And then which was the first one, you think?  Applebee's.  Applebee's.  Applebee's definitely fits.  Applebee's.  It stinks, but Applebee's.  And then Chili's.  That's another one of those restaurants where when they show the commercials on TV, they have  to get a macro focus on the camera because they're showing the food so close because the portions 
[00:08:30]  are so fucking shitty and small.  Like, Red Lobster is great for that.  It's like, look at our shrimp.  It's shrimp day at Red Lobster.  And it's like a bug flying a fighter jet through the fucking food.  It's fucking, yeah, it's like Luke flying through the fucking Death Star Canyon.  That's the camera they use.  The shrimp.  It's barely missing the shrimp because the shrimp is fucking little popcorn shrimp things.  It's a sea monkey on your plate. 
[00:09:00]  It's a fucking sea monkey.  If I have to do more, like, multiple takes because they have to wipe the lens off.  Wipe the lens off.  We hit the shrimp.  Even when I was poor, I knew Red Lobster had shitty shrimp.  Oh, everything was shitty there.  When I ate shrimp, I had saved up and I got those fucking jumbos.  You gotta get the jumbo shrimps.  Fuck that tiny, all-you-can-eat shrimp that you gotta peel yourself.  I used to go there with the ex-wife on Route 110.  Red Lobster?  Actually, on Jericho Turnpike there.  Yeah, we get them scrimps. 
[00:09:30]  I love the scrimps.  Scrimps is good.  You did all you could eat?  Shrimp?  Oh, the Lobster Fest.  Who didn't go to Red Lobster for Lobster Fest?  What a white trashy, black trashy fucking thing to do.  But in all fairness, a small lobster tastes pretty damn good.  Well, you know what?  I didn't give a shit at the point because it was like I thought I was living large.  It's like, that's right, baby.  Taking you out to Red Lobster tonight.  Let's go. 
[00:10:00]  Let's go.  Let me hit the ATM, though, so I can take out a 20.  That's it.  Take that out.  They have good biscuits, though.  Drinks.  They have good biscuits over at Red Lobster Restaurant.  Oh, they'd have those cheesy biscuits.  Yeah.  That was some good shit right there.  I never ate a Red Lobster, but I remember Sizzler.  They had like that cheesy garlic red.  Sizzler's another one.  That's a pseudo restaurant, man.  It might as well be Red Lobster, but it's just called Sizzler.  It's the Red Lobster for steak.  Is that the one where they stamped the steaks to make it look like it was a better cut than 
[00:10:30]  it was?  Yes.  They pretty much tattooed every steak to make you think you're...  They should call it the Grizzler.  Yeah.  That's all you got.  Yeah.  It's grizzle.  Well, man, they knew how to stamp that shit to make it look like it was grade A.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That was good shit right there.  Anyone else see that?  It was on over the weekend.  They're actually squeezing meat together.  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  What did...  Oh, someone's got to help me out.  I didn't think we were going to talk about this.  I think it's called meat glue. 
[00:11:00]  And what they're doing is they're getting a lot of kind of shitty smaller pieces of meat,  and they put it all together with this glue to make it look like you got a grade A piece of meat.  Like a cut of meat?  And the experts say you can't even tell the difference.  I bet I can.  Janine's saying Sizzler is like the cafeteria at the nuthouse.  It is kind of a cafeteria setting.  I don't like that at all.  One of my favorite things about Sizzler is because I love restaurants that have to have their own architectural design. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  To make them stand out, like IHOP or whatever.  Right.  Sizzler was another one of those joints where after they go out of business and, like, you know,  some funeral home takes it over.  Or a law firm or something.  It's still in the shape of a Sizzler.  Isn't that always weird?  I love when there's, like, an IHOP and there's, like, some lawyers, like a lawyer office.  Does he need that big blue roof cathedral ceiling or shit like that?  He's right, man.  EROC.  Down south, some pizza huts were converted to churches.  Like, you know what it is, but the roof is blue and they put the cross on it. 
[00:12:00]  How often do you go in there to pray?  Can you please find...  See, I was kidding.  I need to find one picture of that today.  I gotta see that.  The worst was here on Long Island in the New York area where we had Carvels, because Carvels  were probably the most distinct-looking buildings.  They were shaped kind of like a trapezoid.  The big, tall front and the back roof would level down.  It was just weird.  It was shaped like a doorstop. 
[00:12:30]  And there were two big posts out front with giant ice cream cones on them that would spin  around and shit.  And all of a sudden, it's the law office of Levy and Phillips and Konigsberg.  Like, where it's now a strip club or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like, that was a fucking Carvel.  That was a Carvel, man.  That place was just selling fucking Fudgy the Whale.  Yeah.  And now you gotta see some of these buildings that are now converted into something else.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Carvel.  Oh, this guy knows.  Howard Johnson's.  Lore and PA.  By the way, some woman on Twitter last night thinks that you and I hate women or something.  Really?  I think all women are holes.  Um, I don't...  Let me think.  Um, no.  Maybe we portray it that way, but...  Well, she's just an asshole.  We really love pussy.  Yeah, yeah.  Lore, what's going on?  What's the matter?  Hey, the meat glue that you're talking about, that's called gastronomic cooking? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah?  What is that?  It's...  They use chemicals on your food instead of using actual food.  So they cook it with meat glue and different, uh, chemicals.  Oh, well...  Nitrous oxide.  Man.  Well, that's not, that's not what I was, uh, looking at the other night on TV.  It was some kind of actual glue where they're gluing, uh, smaller pieces of meat together to make it look like one big, nice piece of meat.  Yeah, that's hard.  If you go to any kind of gastronomic restaurant and you get a piece of meat, it's not the actual meat that you think it is. 
[00:14:00]  Like, they'll take different parts of the chicken and then use this meat glue and then use a bath to kind of, like, suck the air out and make it into a different shape.  Yeah, they shape it into a really nice piece of steak.  That's crazy.  And it's not just a restaurant.  You know, uh, this stuff is finding its way to your supermarkets and all that crap.  Definitely.  I don't know about that.  Yeah, I had no idea.  You can't see a seam?  But you know what?  The experts go, you, you would never be able to tell. 
[00:14:30]  So, if you're not able to tell, does it really matter in the end?  Oh, look at that.  They're showing where the, uh, the points of fusion.  Yeah, you need some drywall tape for those.  Yeah, you can see that.  Yeah, that needs to be sanded down.  My point is...  Spackled.  This is almost a non-story, because they said the experts are saying you would never tell.  So, who cares then?  If it tastes good.  You know what?  If you look at a cut of meat, and it's, it's, like, I could see seams on that fucking thing.  Right there?  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  But you, you probably have eaten that a million times and never knew it.  I don't think so.  You don't think so?  I'd be like, why the fuck is the grain changing directions?  Yeah, you can kind of see that, right?  Yeah, that's some ghetto shit right there.  It needs to weld that better.  Yeah, yeah.  You need to get a bead when you're working on that.  Yeah, you got a good bead.  It needs corner bead on the fucking side.  You think that's ghetto shit right there?  That's ghetto meat right there.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh. 
[00:15:30]  All right, meat glue.  Get on it.  You found meat glue?  Well, this apparently is meat glue also.  I don't, I mean, obviously, it's obvious.  It's not steak, but I don't know what the fuck that is.  Yeah, they put meat inside a gelatin kind of a thing.  Meat glue's secret.  Meat glue's secret.  It's a video?  Yeah.  Oh.  Meat glue's secret.  Film the time we spilt the meat glue.  All over your face.  Yes, yes.  That's what the secret butchers don't want you to know about. 
[00:16:00]  Major suppliers have been caught using a special product known as meat glue.  Meat glue.  To stick together scraps of meat to sell as prime cuts.  But while this product has been banned overseas, there's no law prohibiting its use here.  Here's what he lives for this special investigation.  Fucking meat glue, eh?  Ominous music.  I love this ominous fucking music.  Yeah, they put it in plastic to that secret.  It's the meat industry's dirty secret. 
[00:16:30]  Dirty.  A way of turning the scraps too small to sell as a premium steak back into a juicy plump eye fillet to sell for a premium price.  Wow, that's something, eh?  So clever, you'll never tell.  Not even an expert.  Oh, it's flagged?  Before, you didn't even pick that as a joint, though, did you?  He doesn't even tear through the joint.  A bit hard to tell, isn't it?  Aye.  Fuck.  Butcher James Faulkner runs Queensland Natural Beef Company,  an organisation dedicated to using as few additives in meat from paddock to plate as possible. 
[00:17:00]  But tonight, he's exposing how some parts of the industry are able to trick their customers and use whatever it takes.  Oh, no!  Let's get some fine diced, diced beef.  Oh, no!  Special enzyme.  Special enzyme.  Let's go mix it up a bit.  Yeah.  Why have we got the masks on?  Because it's dangerous s**t.  It's dangerous s**t.  It's dangerous.  Don't breathe that in.  This powder is transglutanamase enzyme, otherwise known as meat glue. 
[00:17:30]  Meat glues come in a number of forms.  Some produced by cultivating bacteria.  The others, the primary ingredient comes from the blood plasma of pigs and cattle.  Oh, holy s**t.  Specifically, the coagulant, which causes blood to clot.  Whoa!  In the food industry, it has amazing properties.  So, it looks good a little bit here.  About a teaspoon full.  Yep.  It breaks down the meat and then...  Just over the top like that.  And with our gloves on, of course, we mix it up. 
[00:18:00]  Then roll it in plastic film and refrigerate.  Six hours later, you have a solid piece of meat.  Get the f**k out of here.  Essentially, you've got a reborn, rebirth by Philip.  How the f**k did he do there?  How the f**k did they throw this out?  That's more impressive.  It's easy to spot the difference.  But cooked is another story.  Okay, so the meat glue one is on the right.  Right.  And the real McCoy is on the left.  I can tell.  Cook it out. 
[00:18:30]  And it's not just beef.  Pork, lamb, fish and chicken are all stuck back together using this glue.  It looks like one piece of chicken.  It's unbelievable, isn't it?  Yep.  But I have to tell, isn't it?  Particularly that.  On the grill, it's even harder to pick.  So that's the real McCoy.  Give me some burl.  Yeah.  Take a fork full, shove it in your mouth.  Nice and tender, nicely salted.  All right, let's go for the meat glue. 
[00:19:00]  Tender.  Does it taste the same?  If it does, who gives a f**k?  I can't tell the difference.  So who cares?  Pretty good, but potentially dangerous.  Oh, wow.  Potentially.  I've just got two concerns.  One that is well publicised, which is misleading people.  The other area is the microbial side.  Microbial?  Oh, no.  It's the microbial side, eh?  You're a f**king cat.  Glenn Pinner.  If this food is sold or represented as a solid piece of steak and you cook it rare, you're really leaving yourself open to get food poisoning. 
[00:19:30]  Once you glue two pieces together, it's difficult to cook thoroughly those parts that were on the outside but are now on the inside.  Ah, you know, the amount of bacteria on a steak that has been put together with meat glue is hundreds of times higher.  We had no idea how guarded a secret. 
[00:20:00]  He's grilling as he's doing this shot, which is hysterical.  Oh, this guy.  Oh, this guy.  Many of them didn't want to speak for fear of upsetting their suppliers.  This cube roll we bought from a wholesaler that produces stuck-together steaks en masse.  Their efforts so good, James, our butcher, couldn't tell even when it was raw. 
[00:20:30]  It's even harder in the restaurant, which are some of the biggest users of glued meat.  Now, chances are, unless you're a vegetarian, you're eating it on a regular basis.  But with current labelling laws, neither butchers nor your local eatery have to tell you you're eating chicken glued together with cow's blood or beef held together by pig.  It's the same reason they can take low-grade meat and pump it with water and flavour to make it edible. 
[00:21:00]  Okay, so just a minute or two.  Do that shit, too?  Quite a lot of moisture out of there.  That's crazy.  And we've lost almost half a kilo.  Kilo?  Then the practice of selling mutton as lamb and old cow as prime cut beef.  Like this.  So old, a meat grater said it was only good for pet mince.  Oh, that's Australia.  Really dark meat colour. 
[00:21:30]  It's definitely off a really old type of animal.  In New South Wales, new labelling regulations have just been introduced to help consumers choose quality meat.  But it's not compulsory.  So for most of us, picking a quality piece of meat is still a shot in the dark.  Ah, something tells me they ain't doing that here.  You don't think?  Nay.  Nay?  Nay.  Why?  There's a lot of money in that, eh?  I've never seen a glued together piece of meat.  Pretty interesting. 
[00:22:00]  Did you know they were doing that?  Fucking London broil, and it's great.  There's no fucking glue.  I don't see no seams.  You sure?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  I'm pretty sure I'd be able to tell.  Well, now we're all...  Like, looking at that, it's too perfectly round and everything.  It looks silly.  How about we all study our meat the next time we order it?  I look at my meat every day.  Look at your meat closely and see if there's any seams in it.  Come on, my seam.  Yeah.  Have a seam on my meat.  My meat.  All right, Crikey.  It's particle meat. 
[00:22:30]  Kevin from Connecticut.  Yeah, it's like particle board.  Particle.  Right?  Particle meat.  Stupid particle board.  It's meat out of enzymes.  Here at the grill, he's got his fucking...  Apron on.  Dumb apron in his tongs.  He's flipping his glue meat.  And turns toward the camera.  Was that his house?  Yeah, yeah.  You have to call a buddy because he doesn't have a grill.  Could I do a shot at your house?  I might.  I'm going to do a shot.  Need a barbecue.  All right. 
[00:23:00]  I know.  All righty, then.  That fucking...  I'd be able to tell.  I'm sorry.  Hey, before we...  You know what, though?  We just watched that whole thing about the meat glue.  Yeah.  Next time you're eating, are you ever going to think about the meat glue?  I'm starving.  And that was the piece I saw.  And I was thinking to myself, if they can't tell them, who cares?  Yeah.  And it sounds like the only thing you could get is maybe food poisoning.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Seems like a lot of people have eaten meat glue and...  Like, when I'm watching, I'm going, wow, that's fucked up.  And then I'll just go eat meat.  I don't care.  I'll go eat a burger.  The dramatic music didn't justify that story. 
[00:23:30]  Right?  Yeah.  It was so dramatic.  Very dramatic.  I want to just congratulate Travis on a fine win by his boys last night.  Thank you.  It's not over yet.  Oh, the Habs won, huh?  They sure did.  They got to go to Game 7.  Game 7 tonight, Boston.  Oh, man.  Tonight in Boston.  Yep.  Oh, that's a tough one right there.  That's going to be tough.  That's a tough one.  Don't say that.  And I heard we missed one of the best hockey games ever. 
[00:24:00]  Apparently, yeah.  The Blackhawks and Canucks.  They'd start at 10 o'clock.  I can't fucking stay up for that shit.  And what?  Overtime?  Yeah.  Vancouver won in Sudden Death Game 7 overtime.  Damn.  I...  It doesn't get more exciting than that.  You want to watch that final game over my house?  No.  Oh, because I thought I would sit there and, you know, get into it with you like I did  the other night.  I'm respectfully declining your invitation.  Why don't we all just get together and watch Game 7? 
[00:24:30]  Oh, that'd be great.  What's wrong with you?  I'm in the middle of a big move.  I'm busy.  How great would that be?  We all just like, oh.  I could have everyone over my place because you're moving.  You probably don't have a comfortable spot to watch the game.  No, we still got the couch.  You sure?  Yeah.  I'll announce every icing.  That's fine.  The announcers do that anyway.  That's what I would do it.  The Flyers kicked the shit out of the Sabres last night.  They sure did, yeah.  Jesus.  What was the final there?  I kind of gave you up in the game.  5-2 or something, right? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I had a horrible faux pas last night, too, Ant.  A faux pas?  The beginning of the game, Randy, Ryan, Jesus, Ryan Miller was officially standing on his  head.  It was.  He's standing on his head, literally.  Ridiculous.  Because the Flyers were out playing the Sabres big time.  But Ryan Miller was keeping them in the game.  He was ridiculous.  Yeah.  So I had to acknowledge that on Twitter.  So I'm like, looks like Ryan Miller is playing in God mode today, I said. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, God mode.  And then I went with, he's absolutely standing on his fucking head in this game, right?  Yeah.  I swear to you, less than a minute later, the first goal went by him.  Yeah.  And then I just wrote, I just wrote, oops.  And I basically turned off my Twitter.  It's such a jinx.  And then within minutes, it was 3-0.  Oh.  It was unbelievable.  My timing, it was the best timing ever last night.  I'm reading, Randy gave up four goals and they pulled him? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Everyone, everyone, I got killed.  Because literally right after I tweeted, what was the tweet?  I said, he's standing on his fucking head.  Wow.  You totally jinxed him right there.  I think so.  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah.  Ryan Miller using God mode tonight, standing on his head.  Wow.  And then literally in the same two minutes, I just wrote, oops.  And then it was 4-0 like that. 
[00:26:30]  The game was over.  Sabres didn't deserve that game, though.  Fucking Flyers outplayed him.  Everyone knows.  What's the games tonight, Travis?  You got yours?  Yeah, tonight and Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh at 8 o'clock.  Oh, really?  Game 7.  Yeah, the Lightning are going to win that game.  The Lightning are going to win and the Bruins are going to win.  Oh, boy.  I like the sound of that.  Yeah, don't you?  Yes.  Out of him.  Yes, out of him, yeah.  You don't think the Lightning are going to beat the fucking Penguins?  Are you kidding me?  I'd rather the Lightning win.  I don't like the Penguins. 
[00:27:00]  The Penguins are, you know, they're a hurting team right now.  Sure.  Hey, Lindsay Lohan, Ann.  Yeah, huh?  We both saw this just before we went on the air.  For some reason, she got a standing ovation on Jay Leno.  Why wouldn't she?  She's a loser drug addict.  She comes out on Leno, and they give her a standing ovation.  For what?  Does anyone know?  For being a former child star that has been in nothing but trouble since adolescence. 
[00:27:30]  She does drugs, and she's going to jail.  And she likes to steal stuff.  Yeah, that sounds like something you would, you know.  She's gotten a million chances.  If we did half the shit that she's done, we would definitely be in jail for a while.  Be in the gernt.  I'd be in the gernt.  Not just for a month or two, like she's probably going to get in the end.  We'd be in there for a while.  Yeah.  And these dummies out there in L.A. are giving her a standing ovation.  They love her.  It's that train wreck mentality.  It's why are people buying tickets for Charlie...  Well, we're buying tickets for Charlie Sheen's big tour. 
[00:28:00]  Dumb tour.  People just love seeing the train.  And she's a huge fucking fan.  But why the standing ovation?  The standing ovation's a little odd.  That's odd.  They are...  Seven minutes.  Are they...  Yeah, okay.  Because she's standing.  I do. </pre>
