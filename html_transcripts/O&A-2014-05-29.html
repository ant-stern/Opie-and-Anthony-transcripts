<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Sam Roberts hosting the pre-show, focusing on the disappointing lack of studio renovations promised during the hosts' vacation.  A humorous clip from a 2007 "Best Of" show featuring Opie, Louis C.K., and Bob Kelly conducting a crude, sexually explicit phone contest was played.  Opie and Anthony then joined, expressing their frustration over the minimal improvements: a falling banner, a broken AC filter, and equipment relocated from a rack to the desk. Anthony recounted his Mexican vacation, including a questionable encounter with a possibly drugged baby lion.  A technical discussion ensued with audio engineer Mars, highlighting a new wireless mouse as the biggest upgrade, and a new but impractically slow remote for the studio TVs.  Greg Sestero, author of *The Disaster Artist*, was mentioned as a scheduled guest. The conversation repeatedly circled back to the inadequate renovations, with Mars detailing the small changes made (a new countertop and vacuuming).

The show continued with a deeper dive into studio equipment issues and Mars's disgruntled perspective.  He detailed numerous unfulfilled equipment requests, feeling undermined and possibly underpaid. He admitted to deliberately messing with the hosts' microphones.  Jimmy’s (likely Anthony's) Mexico trip was recounted, filled with highly offensive language describing negative experiences with United Airlines, including being bumped from first class and luggage problems. He contrasted the negative travel experiences with the overall niceness of the people he met in Cancun, Mexico.  Further complaints about United Airlines followed, referencing a critical Huffington Post article about its CEO.

The next segment detailed a Mexico destination wedding trip, focusing on gastrointestinal issues, a seaweed-infested beach, and a hilariously intoxicated woman defecating in the pool filter.  The hosts then discussed over-the-counter Cialis, accidental penis exposures, and a bizarre series of public apologies during a commercial break.  A new intern was subjected to a graphic initiation involving a disturbing pornographic video description.  The segment concluded with a discussion of an air show, a comparison of one host's photography to Ansel Adams', New York City's ferret ban (contrasted with the horse-drawn carriage debate), and a photo of Scout Willis topless, prompting a discussion of Instagram's nudity policies.

A following segment focused on the ferret ban and its history, punctuated by humorous interjections and sound effects.  This transitioned into discussions of Donald Sterling’s controversy, Rory McIlroy's breakup, and a listener's explicit sexual offer to Opie and Anthony.  Adam Sandler's filmography was humorously reviewed, including a lyric mispronunciation ("Rain On Me" vs. "Rain Or Me"). A list of celebrities who have accidentally or intentionally killed people was also presented.  A fictional "Adventures with Alex Jones" segment, filled with conspiracy theories, and the upcoming Greg Sestero interview were mentioned.

The long interview with Greg Sestero about *The Room* followed.  Sestero detailed bizarre anecdotes about Tommy Wiseau's directing style and the film's production, referencing specific scenes and its cult status.  The hosts and Sestero discussed the upcoming film adaptation and briefly revisited Adam Sandler's filmography.

The final segment wove together several topics: Opie's Mexican vacation, including his encounter with a drugged baby lion (and subsequent criticism), and a failed attempt to get a social media retweet for $50.  Mars again discussed his frustrations with management, detailing his perceived scapegoating and intentional microphone sabotage. His candid commentary, including offensive and racially charged language, dominated the segment.  A call from engineer Fontaine expressed both support and frustration with Mars' actions, further highlighting tensions within the technical staff. The segment concluded with discussions about Mars's job security and relationship with Opie, interspersed with advertisements and mentions of Intern David and Jim Norton.

[00:01:00]  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  We're back.  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  My name is Sam Roberts.  This is the pre-show.  The show that is the pre  before the first show back from vacation.  A week and a day 
[00:01:30]  since we've last been with you here on the Opie and Anthony show.  And I mean,  a lot has changed.  Of course,  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969.  Call up the pre-show now  as we get into...  I'll play a few of the clips from the last show that we were on.  But I also want to go over  a lot of the best of  that was played throughout the week.  Because if you weren't listening,  throughout the week, 
[00:02:00]  we've played a set of best of  where every day  was the best of a different year  of Opie and Anthony.  It was a great reflection  on what we've done.  But also,  everything that's happened  throughout the last week and a day.  I feel like we're living  in a different world  than we were when we last left you.  We can go right to the phones.  We'll go to Luke  in New Jersey.  First call back.  What's up, Luke?  Hey, good morning, Sammy. 
[00:02:30]  Good morning.  Just like the comment on  the day you guys went on vacation  and also  a whip-em-out Wednesday,  the news broke that  Ty Brentley got fired.  And I have never seen  more people so happy  that they lost their jobs.  Yeah, I mean,  usually that's a sad thing.  But thank you, Luke.  The Ty Bentley fans  didn't come out and support him.  If you were following along  with the guys on Twitter,  I think Anthony said something  about it, maybe Jim.  Ty Bentley,  who we were talking about 
[00:03:00]  a lot on the show  the week before  we were on vacation,  he was the one,  he was the new morning guy  at 92.3 now,  which is the station  in New York  that used to be K-Rock  that used to house  the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way,  one of the great things,  I was listening to  the best of Over Vacation,  and I heard  the last day  of Opie and Anthony  on K-Rock  and us blowing up  their format change.  That was the last time  they changed a format.  Opie and Anthony  decided to announce 
[00:03:30]  the changing of the format  a day before the station  was actually ready  to announce it,  before they had even  fired the Rock jocks.  Opie and Anthony said,  no, this is going  to be happening.  And I believe it was  24 hours later  that it actually was.  But that station  has changed formats again,  and now Ty Bentley,  the guy who stole  WoW from this show  and then tried  to pawn it off  on what was,  what sounded to us  like a fake caller  to his radio show,  no longer employed  in New York radio. 
[00:04:00]  I wanted to,  I was talking about  the best of we were playing,  I wanted to play  a clip from us  on K-Rock.  It was the best  of 2007 show.  I'm not sure  what day last week  this aired,  or maybe it was this week,  I don't know.  But this was during 2007.  This was when  the studio  was getting built out  on 57th Street for XM.  And I know even bringing up  the studio being built out  leads to a lot of questions  that you may have 
[00:04:30]  as to what's going on  in this studio today.  We'll get to that  in a moment,  but we were talking  about K-Rock,  and I wanted to play  for you this clip  while this,  last time we had  a major studio build out,  it was when we were  on both K-Rock  and XM.  And we had to use  the K-Rock studio  while the XM studio  was being built out.  But what happened was  all the phone lines  that were piped  into K-Rock  for their,  whatever,  midday jock  were visible  to us  at the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:00]  This was on our  best of 2007 show  over the vacation.  Opie,  commandeering  the K-Rock phones  over on the XM side  and doing a contest  of his own  with Louis C.K.  and Bob Kelly  in studio.  That's track 7.  What's your name?  Pat.  Hey, Pat,  can you repeat after me?  I suck cock  for K-Rock.  I suck twat  for K-Rock?  No,  I suck cock  for K-Rock.  You hear it perfectly  except for the word 
[00:05:30]  cock.  Dumb reach.  What?  You can't put that  on the radio.  Yes, you can.  We're going to beep it.  It's okay.  We're trying to be  a little edgier  with the station,  so we'll bleep that part.  So after me.  I suck cock  for K-Rock.  I suck what  for K-Rock?  Again,  perfect pitch hearing  except for the thing  that's constantly  in her mouth.  I'm a professional DJ.  Repeat after me.  Are you ready?  Okay.  All right,  here we go.  I suck cock  for K-Rock. 
[00:06:00]  I suck cock  for K-Rock.  Wow.  You're bad.  You're bad.  Sir,  it's your turn.  All right,  hold on.  Hold on.  Let's let the other guy  get an opportunity.  Now the guy has to say it.  What's your guy?  What's your name, sir?  You talking to me now,  Farron?  Yeah.  Yeah,  what's your name?  My name is Lenny,  man.  Give us a second,  guys,  cock.  I'm getting some laughs  out of you guys.  I'm not getting some tickets,  obviously,  but at least this is entertaining.  Well,  Lenny,  why don't we do this?  Why don't you repeat after me,  okay?  I suck cock for K-Rock.  I refuse to say that, 
[00:06:30]  man.  Hell no.  You don't want the tickets,  then?  I want them.  I want them.  Hold on,  you silly hole.  We're talking to Lenny.  Pat's going to get the tickets  unless you say the phrase,  Lenny.  I'm not saying that phrase.  I'll say any other phrases  at that.  I don't go that way.  All right,  have a...  We've got tickets.  We've got backstage passes.  We've also got a limo  to and from the show.  And your mother's cunt  in a box.  Yeah.  Exactly, boss.  Exactly.  And then we're going to  fuck you with a broomstick.  Or a broom.  Or if we have a broom,  we'll use that.  What the fuck is that?  B-R-U-M? 
[00:07:00]  We have a broom.  All right,  we obviously got a...  We obviously got a problem here.  We got two winners on the line.  We can only give it to one.  All right,  let's give these.  How about we have  a masturbation contest?  First person to come  wins the tickets.  What do you say, guys?  Come on,  I said what you wanted me to say.  I should win.  She feels dirty now.  Yeah, she does.  Do you feel a little dirty?  I hope some of this  makes it on the radio,  at least.  This is not bad.  All right,  whoever...  My husband and my son  would kill me  if this makes it on the radio. 
[00:07:30]  Really?  You shouldn't have said it then,  you fucking titless junk.  Who am I?  Exactly.  Sonny boy is going to know  you suck cock for K-Rock.  What do you think of them apples?  So that was the best of 2007 show,  one of my favorite clips.  But as I said,  that was going on  because we were in the K-Rock studio  while the XM studio  was being built out.  Now we're at Sirius XM,  and that leads to the obvious question.  Dan in Pennsylvania?  Oh, good morning, Sam.  Welcome back.  Oh, thank you, Dan. 
[00:08:00]  Good vacation.  Two questions.  Are you in a new studio,  and how many flat-screen TVs are there?  I'm so glad  that you just asked that question  at that moment  because I swear to you,  I shit you not,  Opie literally  just walked in the door.  I am still broadcasting the pre-show  out of the closet studio.  I am still looking through the glass,  and Opie just walked in.  Opie, can you hear me?  Turn him on.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  Welcome back.  Okay, we just got a call.  I was just playing  a clip from when  you guys were at K-Rock  that we play on  the Best of 2007 show.  Right.  When the last time  the studio was being built out,  and so we had to sit  in another studio.  Right.  A caller, Dan from Pennsylvania,  called up and said,  the question on everybody's mind is,  are we sitting this morning  in a brand new studio?  Opie, what are your immediate thoughts  as you walk in  after eight shows, 
[00:09:00]  or eight days gone?  Well, one of the banners  is falling down.  Well, that's different.  Is that a new thing?  Over here,  this is kind of falling off the wall.  And I noticed,  did we have a wireless mouse  before we left?  No, we didn't, Opie.  No, we did not.  Okay.  There you go.  Aha.  We got a wireless mouse.  My microphone sounds like shit,  by the way.  I swear to God. 
[00:09:30]  You know, like,  yeah, I mean,  it does sound different.  And for the people that go,  oh, all he does is bitch.  Coming back from vacation,  I am so relaxed  and chilled right now.  Yeah, I mean,  it seemed like you were relaxed.  You were hanging out  with baby lines.  I think the thing was drugged,  and now I'm getting shit for it.  But did you guys tweet that yet?  It probably was.  If we haven't,  we'll tweet it now.  But Don Wicklund said,  he admitted finally  that the studio  wasn't going to be,  you know, rebuilt.  When did he admit that?  Well, he didn't officially admit it, 
[00:10:00]  but he hinted strongly,  and he goes,  don't worry,  I will be up there  during your time off,  and I will do as much as I can.  So I guess the much as I can  is a wireless mouse.  He was here yesterday.  It's a wireless mouse  that I could tell  was taken from somewhere else.  Oh, it's not a new wireless mouse?  I don't think so.  No, probably not.  Some studio  just has a keyboard now.  I swear to God,  as I look around,  I don't see anything else  that is different.  It's just one wireless mouse 
[00:10:30]  that's different.  That's it.  The filters on our lights in here?  Yeah?  They didn't even fix them.  It's still,  I can see it from here.  The one that I can see...  It's blowing.  Yeah.  The AC is kind of fluttering  and it's going...  It's still got...  It's still got...  Half a piece of tape  on one end  that is not affixed  to the light.  Oh, Jesus.  Are you serious?  Well,  Sal was just commenting  that in here,  there's a big rack  of equipment.  Right.  And so,  they removed the rack. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  But they left  all the equipment.  So now we just have  the equipment  piled up on the desk,  plugged in,  without the rack.  We were gone  for a while, right?  Eight days.  I'm looking...  There's nothing different!  I can't wait.  All right.  Well,  I won't be enjoying  the pre-show.  I have to watch  the news.  Okay.  Well,  you watch the news,  get caught up  on everything  that's been going on.  Yeah.  How was your vacation? 
[00:11:30]  It was good.  It was relaxing,  driving around.  Where was that  Crackle Barrel thing?  That was in Pennsylvania.  That was right around,  I think probably  around Limerick, Pennsylvania.  Why were you there?  Uh, well,  we...  Jess and I  went on some road trips.  Right.  And we decided  what we wanted to do  was go to small towns  outside of big cities.  So,  we drove to Philly  and then we just  kept driving  and then we went  to the outlets  in like,  Limerick, 
[00:12:00]  the outlets in Chick-fil-A  in Limerick, Pennsylvania.  What a shitty vacation!  And then we went  to Boston,  but then we drove  an hour outside of Boston  and we went to Quincy  and went to Wahlburgers.  Quincy is our...  It's called Quincy.  Quincy?  I mean,  it was a nice drive  because it was along  the coast,  but...  But that just sounds shitty.  We went to Wahlburgers.  Why would you go  outside the nice cities  when you haven't...  We've been to the nice cities.  But you haven't done  anything in the nice cities.  What's that?  What am I going to do?  Look at whatever the... 
[00:12:30]  You went to what?  Lynchburg?  I don't even know  where that is.  Limerick, Pennsylvania.  Oh, Limerick.  And then we swung  by the King of Prussia  on our way out.  Is that where  the Limerick was invented,  at least?  I don't know.  We went to the Chick-fil-A there.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  They don't have Chick-fil-A's  in New York, so...  Right.  That's it.  And at Cracker Barrel,  Jess and I were noticing,  my wife,  that you could be  in some weird town  in Pennsylvania.  You still feel like  you're somewhere in the south.  Like, you feel like  you're way far away from home. 
[00:13:00]  It's like a vacation.  No, that sounds like  a horrible, cheap vacation.  And then you go to Boston.  There's so many cool places  outside of Boston to go.  And you go to Quincy.  No offense to our Quincy pals.  And then we went  right outside Quincy,  whatever town  Wahlburgers is in.  Ah, my God.  Why wouldn't you go  to, like, Walden Pond?  Or why wouldn't you go,  like, to Western Massachusetts?  It's beautiful up there.  What's in Western Massachusetts?  Just a lot of, like,  trees and stuff.  I got trees at home.  What's...  I live in Westchester. 
[00:13:30]  You see, you drive down the hutch,  you see trees.  When did you invent  this vacation?  Day, uh, before.  Kind of day of.  So you were just  wandering around?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We weren't really...  We didn't really have a plan.  At first we thought  we were going to go to D.C.  And then we said,  no, we'll go to Pennsylvania instead.  Pennsylvania?  Yeah.  There's nothing in Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  And then we did...  We only stayed in one night  in a hotel.  We would drive all the way  out to Pennsylvania  and spend hours there  and then at, like,  10 o'clock drive back  and sleep in our apartment.  10 o'clock what? 
[00:14:00]  At night?  Yeah.  So what time  did you get back  to your apartment?  It was like  1 o'clock in the morning.  Oh my God!  Nobody in...  My family had no idea  what I was doing.  None of it made sense.  It sounds like you don't  even know what you were doing.  I don't.  We didn't know  what we were doing  the whole time.  But that's great.  That's what I wanted.  And why would you  keep going back  to your apartment?  I mean, why wouldn't  you just keep going?  Well, we drove...  I've done the  just keep going trips.  Those are the best.  And then you just find  some shitty hotel  at the end of the day  and just crash.  I don't know.  We drove out to...  We did spend a day  in Boston 
[00:14:30]  and that's where  we got a hotel.  What kind of hotel?  It was a nice hotel.  What kind?  Where?  Cambridge.  No, what's the name  of the hotel?  I think the Charles Hotel.  Oh, all right.  It was there  in Harvard Square.  Oh, you stayed  in Harvard Square.  Yeah, it was nice.  All right, that's all right.  But we got it on an app  that you can...  You book the hotel  the morning of.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, so you get  a little rate on that.  You know what I'm saying?  Did you at least  walk around Harvard?  Yeah, we walked  around Harvard a little bit.  To feel smart and shit?  Yeah, we just watched  the social networks.  I like walking around 
[00:15:00]  Harvard and feeling  smart and shit.  Yeah, I felt like  I was getting one over  on all the smart kids  because I don't even  go to that stupid school  and I got to walk  around with them.  I make believe  I'm getting like a PhD.  I walk around like,  that's right, fuckers.  I'm still here.  I go home.  I'm getting my PhD.  I write coding on my window.  I'm smart, too.  That's right.  But then, yeah,  and then from there  we were like,  let's go to Wahlburgers.  What the hell's Wahlburgers?  That's Mark Wahlburg's  burger joint  in some strip mall 
[00:15:30]  outside of Quincy.  I guarantee  he's never been there.  It's not...  So why would you go  to his hamburger joint  where he's never been?  Because his brother  who's not Donnie  apparently runs it.  Which one?  I don't know.  There's a reality show  about it.  About his hamburger joint?  Yeah, it's called Wahlburgers.  What shitty channel  is that on?  A&E.  And why are we talking  about your vacation  instead of mine?  It's my fucking channel.  Technically,  it's the pre-show  with Sam Roberts  right now.  But it says pre-show.  Plus,  what I don't want to do. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  A lot of people  were following you  on Twitter,  so they saw the video  and the photos  of you.  I don't understand  why anybody  would hold  a baby lion  that was handed  to them  by a man  with scars  all over his face.  Like,  they were obviously  baby lion claw scars  all over his face.  You think?  Yeah.  You think that guy  was a little desperate  that he decided  to continue  with his gig  after he got mauled?  Yeah,  I don't think  that he had  a fallback skill set.  Right.  Well,  I didn't hold  the monkeys they had. 
[00:16:30]  Because monkeys  will give you some shit.  They'll give you  some of that  disease shit.  It didn't appear  to be at a zoo,  either.  It looked like  it was just happening  on the street.  No,  it was outside  the Mayan ruins.  They just had  baby lions and monkeys?  Of,  what is it called?  Tmul?  Is that how you say it?  I don't know.  Wait,  let me look it up.  Ask Mars.  Why Mars?  He's Mexican,  right?  I don't know.  I think so,  yeah.  Yeah,  I'm pretty sure.  Tulum,  I mean.  Yeah,  the Mayan ruins  of Tulum.  As you're going  to check out  the ruins, 
[00:17:00]  that guy was there  with his lion.  His baby lion.  And I didn't even  question.  He goes,  you want to hold  a baby lion?  I go,  sure.  Yeah,  that sounds great.  I haven't done that before.  And then as I'm  getting really close,  it's on the video,  I notice all the scars  on his face.  And then I'm like,  well,  you can't pussy out now.  Right,  because what are you  going to jump back  when you see his scars?  They're going to look  like a pussy.  You would.  So I said,  all right.  And I held  the baby lion  and then my wife  was smart enough  to go,  no,  you've got to get 
[00:17:30]  into the video  so everyone  could see the scars  on his face.  Those are absolutely  scars of a guy  that was mauled,  that was clawed  in the face.  Yeah,  probably by that lion  and that lion's mother.  I have a feeling  he's been doing it  for many years  so he probably  had a situation  a few years back  but he's all healed now  and he's back  getting tourists,  gringos  to hold baby lions.  And then as I'm  holding the thing  I feel like,  I felt,  oh shit,  this thing cannot be,  you know,  it has to be  drugged a little bit. 
[00:18:00]  How do you drug  a baby lion?  Well,  that's what I was  going to say.  You think that  after his situation  is when he started  tranking those things  before he gave them  to tourists?  Maybe,  maybe.  He wanted me  to hold it  by his balls too.  Like hold,  like put your hand  on the balls  of the lion?  Yeah,  he gives you  a quick little,  you know,  a quick little course.  He goes,  all right,  take your arm  and then basically  you come in  from the asshole.  You come in  from the asshole  and then you  hold his belly  with your right hand. 
[00:18:30]  So you have to  scoop between the legs  so you could get  his nuts  in the crook  of your elbow.  That's about right  there,  Sam,  yeah.  I understand.  Yeah,  and then I checked  out the ruins  of Tulum.  Was the lion neutered?  It must have been.  I didn't feel  any bullies.  It must have been.  Maybe it was a female.  I don't know.  I don't know that shit.  But now I'm getting  crap because it's obvious  that the thing  might have been drugged.  Well,  the people on the phone  have all the 
[00:19:00]  important questions.  Rob in Boston.  Hey,  Sam,  how are you?  Good.  What's up,  Rob?  Welcome back,  Opie.  Thank you.  Uh,  it's Hingham,  not Quincy.  What?  Hingham,  the town  that Wahlbergers  is in.  Oh,  all right.  Yeah,  you need that  dickhead that  calls and  corrects you,  so I'll be  that dickhead  this morning.  Yeah,  I think I just  saw a sign  for Quincy  on the way  there,  and then I  was like,  well,  that must be  where we are.  I didn't know  what city  we were in  most of the  time. 
[00:19:30]  Ants walking  in.  To a brand  new studio.  Beautiful.  At the company,  they'll be upstairs  like,  why do they hate  us?  Why do those  guys hate us  so much?  Did you show  them the mouse?  Yeah,  we got a new  mouse.  Show them what's  different about it.  It's wireless.  It is wireless.  This is literally  the only thing  I could tell  that's different  in this studio.  It's beautiful. 
[00:20:00]  This is it.  Do you see  anything else  different?  Let me look.  Has that Apple  TV always been  here?  Yes,  it has.  No,  I see nothing  different.  And Don did  say,  look,  okay,  I will be up  there and I  will do as  much as I can  while you guys  are gone.  I don't really,  I mean,  even the filters  and the lights,  look,  look,  there's still  like duct  taped on  and not  well.  I don't see  anything.  Why don't you  like put your 
[00:20:30]  best foot forward  and go,  okay,  they're gone  and I know  they're not  going to come  back to a new  studio,  but I will do  something where  they'll be impressed  when they walk in.  Any new signage  on the door  or anything?  No,  like you said,  this thing is  falling down.  It's like one  of those bedrooms  where somebody  went off to war  and died  and the parents  just shut the door.  All that's  happened is  dust has been  collected.  Yes,  I would say  so.  That is no  difference.  Why would you  do that to 
[00:21:00]  yourself?  I'd be hard  pressed to tell  if anyone was  even in here  during the time  I don't think  they were  because my  microphone sounds  horrendous.  Okay,  so there are  little subtle  differences.  I haven't even  checked.  Oh boy,  that is a  bassy,  shitty mix.  Is Mars here  today?  Yeah,  I think so.  Wow.  I want to tell  him that his  people were  very,  very nice in  Mexico.  His people.  Oh,  his peeps?  Mars is  listening,  please come  into the  Opie Anthony  studio.  Mexican people. 
[00:21:30]  I got to tell  you,  Mexican people  are really  nice.  Mars,  your people  are really  nice.  The Mexicans?  Not Mexican.  What?  You're not  Mexican.  See,  here's the  worst part  though.  Now Mars  like fiddles  with something  and it gets  worse.  Look at how  high this has to be  for him to put  it back to the  shitty way it  was when we  first came in.  Right.  But he has no  idea what he  did to reverse.  I don't know.  What happened?  Oh,  you see what?  Oh,  I got a minus  11 gain. 
[00:22:00]  What the fuck  minus 11 gain?  Is the problem  with wireless  mouse?  Is the issue  that the mouse  is wireless?  What?  Okay.  I think  the issue  is that the  mouse is  wireless.  What did  that do?  Whoa.  There's a lot  of bass there.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  but some  asshole that  uses his  microphone needs  a minus 11  gain.  What's that  about?  What happened?  Hey,  Travis. 
[00:22:30]  Travi.  Good morning.  We started  already.  Hey,  look though.  Apparently Mark  Goodman's  pressing that  button again.  He's letting  everybody listen  free.  I think he's  getting away  with it.  Except you  can't listen  to Opie and  Anthony for  free,  by the way.  No,  we're not  on there.  I read those  tweets over the  break.  That's nice.  They're having  free listening  without O&A.  Because they  knew that you  guys would  come back and  the first thing  you'd mention is  the lack of  change in the  studio.  Yeah.  And they don't  want to give  that for free.  I swear there's  got to be  something else 
[00:23:00]  that was done  besides a  wireless mic.  Wireless.  Oh, you  know what was  done?  Oh, shit.  Mars is going  to give us  the rundown.  Mars, give us  the poop.  Mars, I got  to tell you  though, your  people around  Cancun.  Fucking  dicks.  I just  walked right  by, no  problem.  Remember, that  was supposed to  be effective.  Oh, is the  desk cut in  more?  No.  Your people  down there in  the Cancun  area are just  fucking terrific.  They are, aren't  they?  Some of the  nicest people that 
[00:23:30]  I've ever met  away from, well,  who am I  kidding?  No one's  nice in  America.  What am I  saying?  People are  much nicer  elsewhere.  As soon as  I came back  and landed  customs, of  course, after  having a week  where everyone  was really  nice, you  have to hear,  does anyone  hear me around  this goddamn  place?  Oh, welcome  back.  I'm like,  seriously?  Welcome back.  Just because  we're like tired  travelers and  we're going  through customs  and we're not  really sure, you  know, where the  line is. 
[00:24:00]  God damn it,  is anyone  listening to me?  That was my  welcome back  to America.  They're  authority figures.  Yes, of  course.  So, you know,  they love  kind of  stretching that  whole thing.  But Mars,  you're people,  man.  My people,  huh?  Terrific.  Puerto Rican,  man.  Oh, shit.  Are you  Mayan?  I don't know.  It's Mayan  his own business.  Turns out Mexicans  are Mayans, I  guess.  I learned that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Didn't  our Mayans  invent the  concept of  zero, some  shit like  that? 
[00:24:30]  Well, you're  a living proof  of that.  They were good  mathematicians.  Mathematicians.  No, they  weren't.  Yes, they were.  Bernal said  that in Africa  they had  math and  everything way  before them,  Greek almost.  Right.  Who the hell  is Greg Sestero  who's going to  be in studio  today?  Greg Sestero  wrote the  book,  The Disaster  Artist.  He's the  co-star and  I guess co-producer  of the film  The Room. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, that guy.  With Tommy  Wasau.  All right,  well, rebook  him.  I don't care.  Come on,  you know  Greg.  Yeah, rebook  him.  We don't  care.  We don't want  any guests  today.  He's coming  in.  Just tell  him he,  you know,  go find  somewhere else  to go.  We're going  to see him  at 9.  So what  else was  changed in  the studio,  Mars?  Your mic is  good now,  right?  Ah, it's  all right.  It's the way  it was.  It's all right.  Yeah, that's  what I mean.  It's all right.  It's the way  it was.  That's why I  said it's  all right.  Can you  get me another  cup of coffee,  by the way,  Mars?  I've never  gotten you a  cup of coffee  in the 10 
[00:25:30]  years of that  I've been.  So I don't  see why that  would change  today.  I just feel  like I'm still  in Mexico,  and you're  Mexican,  so I just  felt like you  would get me  a cup of  coffee.  It's the  brown on my  skin.  Oh, the  racism.  It's racist.  Rampant.  Were any of  your ancestors  sacrificed on  one of those  temples that I  saw down there  in Mexico?  Remember that?  That's a great  question.  I wouldn't  know my  ancestors.  You are  absolutely  Mexican.  I can tell  now. 
[00:26:00]  Absolutely.  I can tell  now.  I was down  there for a  week studying  your people.  Yeah, they  looked like  me?  Yep.  And my  Spanish was  terrific.  Was it?  I said  hola a lot.  And you  feel like you  know a little  second language  when they  acknowledge an  hola.  Hola, huh?  Hola, and  buenos dias.  Buenos dias.  Have a good  day.  Are there other  differences in  the studio?  They are.  Hey!  Right, right,  right.  What is it?  This is like  one of those  when they put  two pictures  next to each  other.  And there's  very subtle  differences.  Try to see 
[00:26:30]  what's different.  Oh, there's a  little flower  missing on his  hat.  Yeah.  The difference  is...  Wait, wait,  wait.  Let me try.  Okay.  All right.  It's a brain  exercise.  Is it stuff  like the  wireless mic?  Correct.  Mouse.  That's one.  I mean,  wireless, I  keep saying  mic.  Kenny just  wrote me, but  Kenny's right  there.  Are you eating?  Nice.  Kenny, can I  have another  cup of coffee?  Can someone  get me another  cup of coffee?  The Mexican  will get it  for me.  Oh, shit. 
[00:27:00]  Jesus.  Thank you.  All right, so  we're at  wireless mouse.  All right, what  else there?  Wireless mouse.  How many  differences are  there?  They are?  Well, the  chair's here  officially, I  think.  Is this my  chair, or are  we still  borrowing this?  I think it's  squatters right  at this point.  Are we still  borrowing it?  Is that a  fact?  We have no  clue.  We just secure  it every day.  All we do is  secure that  chair every day.  But they  couldn't even 
[00:27:30]  get new  chairs while  we're gone?  No, that's  not a new  chair.  No, I  know, but  this was newer  than what I  had, so I  consider it  new.  You know  what I  mean?  It's new  to you.  Right.  Like a  rerun.  Right.  What's a  rerun?  Mars, what  part of  Mexico is  your family  from originally?  Tequila?  I'm not  from Mexico.  You sure?  Yes.  Is the  mic boom,  has it been  lubed?  No.  Maybe that  was a  difference.  It felt a  little nicer. 
[00:28:00]  It's not  squeaking as  much.  Give us  the changes.  All right,  various  changes were  they're not  changes that  you will  appreciate.  I love  it.  Oh, jeez.  We're more  bells and  whistles, guys.  If you get  a brand new  car, we're  like, ooh,  the GPS looks  nice.  Right.  You know  what I mean?  We don't  give a fuck  how it  drives.  All right,  since we  couldn't get  any money  from the  budget for  all your new  equipment.  For anything.  For anything,  you mean.  Look around, 
[00:28:30]  Jim.  Soak it in.  Soak in all  the changes.  Jimmy Norton.  Mars is  about to  tell us  all the  changes that  happened while  we were gone  for eight  days.  Eight days  where Don  said, I'll  be up there  and I will  make as many  changes as I  can.  You will be  happy when you  get back.  start early.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really  early on.  610.  I was asked  to provide  Sam's computer  on all the  display monitors  and I  could do  that. 
[00:29:00]  What  monitors?  I could put  his video  on any TV.  Oh.  So now,  instead of  us saying,  hey, you  make it  bigger over  here.  Wow.  Could you  show us  an example  of that?  That'd be  good.  You actually  updated to  Apple TV,  which they  supposedly had  for years.  Yes, right.  That's pretty  much it.  All right.  That's a nice  change.  Does Sam  know how to  use this  machine?  Look at 
[00:29:30]  you.  You're  pressing  buttons.  You're  like the  Wizard of  Oz.  Yeah, I  don't know  how to  use that.  Look at  that.  There's a  little wireless  module thing.  I don't know  what that is.  That was  raised?  Oh, my  God.  He's pushing  very hard.  He's pushing  buttons and  nothing's really  working.  This is not  a timely  function.  He's turning  like knobs.  He doesn't  know what  he's doing.  It's not  exactly something  that we do  at a moment's  notice.  Oh, there  it is.  Oh, wow.  Look at  that.  That's  wonderful. 
[00:30:00]  And I  could do  that on  all the  TVs.  Just in  case.  We need  eight TVs.  We have  a monitor  right there.  Yeah, look.  I'll just  look at  that one.  Why would  we go over  there when  we can  just see  it over  there?  Because  it's  bigger and  better and  brighter.  I can't  see it.  Can you put  it back  there?  Oh, yes.  I can.  Thanks.  Oh, let's  see.  How long  does it  take to  get it  back  there?  I  don't  know.  He's  like pressing  two buttons  at once.  I don't know  what he's  doing.  Turn your  key, sir.  That's not  it.  That's not  it.  That's  Sinatra.  That's not  it.  See, we  would have  moved on  to another 
[00:30:30]  topic by  now.  Right, right,  right.  So this is  useless.  It's faster  just to go,  hey, Sam,  turn that  more.  It's still  not up  there.  It's still  not up  there.  It's still  not up  there.  This is  not instantaneous.  It's still  not up  there.  It's still  not up  there.  It's going  to require  a lot of  planning.  Right there.  Nope, it's  not there yet.  Oh, not  that one.  I went  the other  tier.  Wow, this  takes a long  time to do.  I don't think  I'm ever  going to use  this functionality.  But Mars,  what's  happening?  Mars, what's  going on?  What  happened?  It's still  not up 
[00:31:00]  on that  TV.  You're  fumbling  and bumbling  over there  with that  thing.  I think we  might be  back to  just the  wireless  mouse.  Mars, it's  still not up  there.  We would  have moved  on by now.  So this  is one of  the other  big improvements.  Boy, Mars,  it's not up  there yet.  I love it.  Mars, hey  Mars, what's  going on?  This is great.  I'm enjoying  the De Niro  tribute to  Don Rickles  on I Miss  the Show. 
[00:31:30]  It's still  not.  That's just  the television  though, right?  Not the  computer.  Oh, that's  not the  computer.  That's just  the television  I think.  Mars?  Yes, sir.  We're still  waiting.  Yeah.  Mars?  Mars.  This is  supposed to  be  something that  is almost  instantaneous.  Oh, Mars.  As we, you  know, move  around.  It's been  minutes.  Mars?  Anything?  Yeah, no, it's  still over there.  But we want  it over here.  Just unplug the  goddamn thing.  We want it  over there. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, boy.  Mars?  I'm working on  it.  He's working  on it.  Uh, Mars.  I see what the  fuck I did  wrong.  Oh, you do?  Wait, you have  to go all the  way over to the  TV?  You're changing  professions.  I see what I  did wrong, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Wait, what  happened?  You have to  walk over and  change it  physically?  That's very  convenient.  Wait, how is  that going to  help us?  Those two  there are not  so important,  okay?  These are the  ones that we  can change.  You mean the  ones in Jimmy's  eyeline?  But those  guys can see  the monitor.  I don't want to 
[00:32:30]  have a complaint  to see the  monitor.  Jim's the  only one who's  ever complained.  I've never  complained about  looking at a  monitor if we're  looking at a  video or something.  Never.  I'm the only  one who can't  see it.  You actually  have to walk  all the way  over the TV  and change the  settings?  I don't even  remember to  turn the  monitor.  Can you do  that with a  remote?  You know they  have remotes  now.  Right, right.  Instead of  turning it, I  want you to  get up and  walk over to  the thing.  That is a  horrible change.  Yeah, I would  say that doesn't  really help me  at all.  That's actually a 
[00:33:00]  hindrance.  Yeah.  Mars, though,  man, your  people down there  in Cancun were  terrific.  I'm telling you,  they were  wonderful people.  So you got  that going for  you.  Wait, why is  the computer on  that monitor  now?  In that  corner?  Because I  put it there.  Oh, it  finally popped  up over there  too.  Okay.  All right.  Hey.  What else has  changed in the  studio?  Wireless,  mouse, and a  10-minute wait  to see a video.  No, that works  a lot faster, 
[00:33:30]  man.  It doesn't work  a lot faster if  the person has to  physically get up  and change the  settings on the  actual TV across  the room.  It's faster for him  just to turn the  monitor.  Why would we ever  do that?  I can never  picture myself  going, guys,  hold on, I'm  going to go  change the  television channel.  The show's all  about timing.  Yes.  Timing's very  important.  Well, those  particular TVs,  they're not  connected to the  direct TV like  these are.  Right.  They're on the  house channel. 
[00:34:00]  They're on the  house.  House cable.  Right.  So we never  really changed  those right there.  How'd you  picture this  going, Mars?  I didn't  picture anything.  How'd you  picture this  whole scenario  playing out?  They tried that  shit earlier  yesterday.  Oh, fuck  you.  I ain't falling  for that shit,  man.  No, huh?  Absolutely.  If I have to  get up and  you're right,  this is good.  I tapped out.  I wasn't listening  to you anymore.  What happened?  No, I got a  little wind.  They were trying  to get a fall 
[00:34:30]  guy.  For what?  For shit not  happening.  For what wasn't  happening?  For you?  He's trying to  throw someone  under the bus.  We've been back  five minutes.  Dude, you have  no idea what  I want to do.  This place will  never change.  They were trying  to throw you  under the bus.  For what reason?  For what?  There's a list  that Don  Wicklund put out.  A list of things  that he wanted  done in the studio?  Wicklund's list.  However, I'm  essential to the  radio show effort.  Was he up here 
[00:35:00]  this week?  He was here.  Occasionally.  I saw him  yesterday, yeah.  You were here  yesterday?  No.  No, he came  over here to  bring me  equipment.  Is that what  they call it  these days?  Yes, his  equipment.  This is great.  What happened?  I think the  pre-show's done,  Sam.  Great job.  Thanks.  Thank you.  All right.  One of my many  bosses comes down  and says, hey,  do you have  everything squared  away in the  studio?  And I says, 
[00:35:30]  as far as what  I can do,  yes, I have.  He goes,  what do you  mean?  Well, there's  all this equipment  that we don't  have.  Oh, man.  And we can't  do it.  Why don't we  have it?  Does Don know  about it?  Yes, Don knows  about it because  the budget doesn't  allow him to get  the equipment.  For example,  new board,  robotic cameras,  wireless,  HDMI.  Sounds dangerous.  New furniture.  That wasn't on  the list.  Oh, well, it  was originally  cutting this  would be this  cutting this 
[00:36:00]  or counter.  Yes.  But the cameras  and stuff.  I remember  them blueprints.  Remember the  blueprints of  the new console?  I'm not going to  be here in  October.  I'm telling you  right now.  Oh, my God.  I'm moving on.  If you guys  want to move  on with me,  it would be  great.  But if not,  no worries.  I am not  staying here.  This is stupid  at this point.  And just to  let you know,  since we're on  that point,  I told them  that my allegiance  to you guys  is much greater  than the company.  So they got  bothered by that  because I saw  that they were  trying to get me  in between management 
[00:36:30]  trying to find  a fall guy.  So I let them  know.  You're horrible  at explaining things.  A fall guy  for what?  Yes, I'm fixing  them.  Start from the  beginning.  You were given  a list of things  to change in the  studio.  Right.  And what were  some of those  things?  I'll help you  through this.  I'll get the  list.  I'll get the  list.  But what were  some of the  changes?  Some of the  changes to  robotic cameras.  Okay.  I don't even  see a drill hole. 
[00:37:00]  No, not at all.  I don't even  see like maybe  a hole that  was drilled  for a wire.  But why  would you  think of  the hole?  Of the hole?  Why wouldn't  you think of  the fucking  camera?  We don't  have them.  Oh my God,  that's why you  belong behind  the scenes.  That's my  point, that  they didn't  even go with  a drill hole.  Right.  No prep work.  No prep work.  Where's your list?  I think the list  might actually help.  All right, let's  get cameras that  have been sent.  I think the list  might help.  Get the list  enough.  I think the list  would help.  Let's get the list.  The list would  really help.  This is kind of  going, it's pretty  difficult to get  the information.  Yeah, the list 
[00:37:30]  would be good.  I think the list  would be helpful.  Yes.  You can just  read off the list.  Hi, everyone.  I knew nothing  had changed.  I found out  yesterday.  Oh, I knew  before we left.  You know what  I mean?  What about the  mouse?  Well, we got a  wireless mouse.  We got the  wireless mouse.  That's pretty  fucking cool.  I swear this  is the only  thing I noticed  different in the  whole studio.  I mean, that's  cool.  Any other  1998 editions?  You know what  the cool thing  is about this? 
[00:38:00]  Like when you  throw it?  Oh, no.  Oh, there it  goes.  It goes flying  across the room  because it's not  attached to anything.  All right, I  have the mouse.  There's a mouse  back there.  Can you go get  my mouse?  You threw the  wireless mouse.  Of course.  I ran away,  Mars.  That's what's  great about a  wireless mouse.  You can throw  it.  You don't need  it right now.  We're not  taking it.  The wireless  cat's chasing  it.  I'll get it  in a second.  So I have  a list.  Certainly not  the drugged  up baby  line I  held.  That thing's  not chasing  anything. 
[00:38:30]  Poor thing.  Go ahead,  Mars.  Where's the  list?  I have a  list for  the two  studios.  So we'll  begin with  this studio,  Studio 11.  The first  thing you were  right, the  first thing on  the list is  new countered  top.  There's two  studios that  are being  done?  What's the  other studio?  Has anything  been done to  the other  studio?  Yes.  And what's  the other  studio?  Just silly  stuff.  What's the  other studio?  44.  Who's 44?  Next door.  Entertainment  Weekly.  Oh.  Entertainment  Weekly?  No.  This  studio right 
[00:39:00]  here.  Oh.  Hours.  Oh, they  say the  production room.  We don't  call it a  studio.  Who calls  it 44?  I'm pointing  right at it.  But that's  also the  direction that  the Entertainment  Weekly thing  is.  Can you get  my mouse?  I'm going to  throw it  again.  Okay.  Please.  Oh, there  goes.  So, the  very first  thing was  the new  countertop  slate  colored  reformatted.  Cool.  Where's  that?  Where is  that?  I don't  see it.  Is it  on order  at least?  Is it  in other  boxes?  That is  something you  have to see.  Why'd you  do that,  man?  Don't give 
[00:39:30]  it back  to him.  It's fun  to throw  this thing.  All right.  So, they  told me to  remove your  CD players and  leave you just  with one.  I don't know.  Why?  The Denons?  All right.  They're both  here, though.  Right.  I said that's  a bad idea  because if  one malfunctions  during the  show, you  have the  other one  to jump in.  Two engines  on a plane.  Right.  And also,  a very small  thing, your  instant replay  would wobble  with only one  Denon CD  player.  Oh.  You don't want  a wobbly  instant replay. 
[00:40:00]  It's the last  thing you want.  How would it  wobble?  It would be  sitting on  one CD  player.  Oh, that's a  technical term.  You mean  physically it would  just tip over.  But now it's  on two, so  it won't wobble.  Yeah, that's  true.  It's wobble  proof.  It's not  wobbling.  It's not  on anymore  either.  Oh, no.  Oh, it's  rebooting.  Lighting in  studio.  Lightning?  It doesn't  say what to  do with that.  It just  says lighting  in the studio.  And it  was to get  a spot where  you guys can 
[00:40:30]  take...  Well, couldn't  they have at  least dusted  the lights or  the filters?  There's light  in here.  How come  that?  Yes, they  did.  There is light.  There is  light.  Mind this  with light.  Mars?  The next  thing is  robotic  cameras.  Those damn  robotic  cameras.  I dressed  all up today  too.  I have my  suit and tie  on.  Oh, that's  right.  No one  can see me.  You have  a top hat  on and a  monocle.  I certainly  do.  It's the new  visual element  of the radio  program.  It's wonderful.  So no  robotic cameras. 
[00:41:00]  That sounds  scary anyway.  I don't know,  like transformers.  There's a  switcher to be  added.  I'm sorry,  Mars, can I  ask you how  many were  supposed to be  robotic cameras?  Did they say?  They didn't say.  Okay.  They didn't say.  A million then.  Just say a  million of them.  A million  robotic cameras.  Might as well  be.  Absolutely.  Might as well  be a million  that aren't here.  What was this  list given to  you?  A while ago?  That is true.  A little  before you,  when you went  on vacation,  like a day or  two before.  So where are  the robotic  cameras?  They're on  order, right?  They left.  They've become  aware.  I think you 
[00:41:30]  have to  re-sign for  five years  or something.  That ain't  happening.  I'll take a  little pass-a-roo  on that.  Well, it's a  budget constraint.  Budget constraint.  All right, what  else is on the list?  Okay, next thing  on the list was  switcher added to  Sam's location.  Switch my  attitude?  No, switcher.  Oh, switcher.  Don't know what  switcher they wanted?  Don't have the  switcher?  Goddamn switchers.  Yeah, and we  had to move  Sam.  You probably  enjoyed it because  you're a  switcher lover. 
[00:42:00]  Sorry.  All right, switcher.  And also Sam's  location was to  be moved over to  another location.  Up to a dumpster.  Yeah, away.  Because he's  garbage.  I understood it,  but I'm still  happy to explain it.  So Sam's got a  switcher, what's  that mean?  Well, we were  supposed to move  him and he was  supposed to get  another switcher  like...  Stop saying  switcher.  Right. 
[00:42:30]  It's a new movie.  The switcher.  He just switches  things.  Or the swisher.  It's about  Sal.  Sorry, Sal.  Yeah.  The next thing  is a photo spot  created with  perfect lighting.  Ah, so when we  take pictures with  the cavalcade of  celebrities.  That's right.  Absolutely.  That it doesn't  look like shit.  It looks like  shit.  When our  Dominique  Ansel photos  took him out  good. 
[00:43:00]  Yes.  Oh, that's  right.  He never  came.  Without TVs  on the background,  without assholes  behind the glass  walking down  hallways.  Or just so the  shadows aren't  fucking, you  know, horrendous.  Yeah, lights  shining on our  flaws.  Right.  Just highlighting  every fucking  horrific flaw  flaw and  on our  person.  All right.  That didn't,  that could  have, you  know, that's  something they  could have  probably have  done.  But I, as  I look at the  lights, they  haven't been 
[00:43:30]  moved an inch,  a smidge.  They haven't  even been  moved a smidge.  Not a smidge.  Next is add a  new Lavo 16  channel board.  Lavo lamps.  You were supposed  to get a new  board.  Oh.  That is not  happening.  Not today  anyway.  Fabric wrap  panels.  They were  supposed to do  something with  the fabric.  Fabric.  Oh, fabric.  These things?  Fabric.  These things?  Yes.  That are sort  of like all  wrinkly and  look at this.  So those are  supposed to be  fabric wrapped 
[00:44:00]  panels.  I found  something that  had been done.  What?  That you guys  were not being  appreciative of.  Okay.  Someone came  in here and  vacuumed up.  You know what?  The floor looks  better.  It has been  vacuumed.  So we got a  wireless mouse  and they  vacuumed for  the first time.  Yep.  All right.  All right.  The fabric  wrap thing.  That can happen.  Smaller mic  flags.  You can't even  do that.  Smaller mic  flags.  Why do we need  smaller mic 
[00:44:30]  flags?  So like your  face isn't in  the middle of a  fucking picture.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  They kind of  show up well in  pictures.  I've seen like,  you know,  sometimes they've  been published.  Right.  And the  Opie and  Anthony.  Yeah.  Shows up very  nicely.  All right.  What else?  Add smaller  call the screen  monitor for  Anthony.  That was already  done.  Oh.  But it was on  the list.  That's all  happened.  That was done  a long,  after waiting  two years,  that was done.  Remove all  non-essential  monitors near  the table.  So I removed 
[00:45:00]  the monitor  that was here  for Sam.  It was a  duplicate for  the dilette.  Took that  out of there.  Oh, we  didn't notice  that.  The arm is  gone.  That goes  back to  those two  pictures.  Right.  Like,  fuck,  her shoe  is  blown.  I didn't  notice that.  It has  three buttons  and not  four.  That's exactly  right.  Look at all  that room we  got now.  All that room  to play around  with in the  corner on top  of the console.  We can have  our dance  competition there.  We have  never used  that little 
[00:45:30]  space.  Nothing.  I didn't  even notice  there was  anything over  there.  Nothing.  All right.  Continue.  Remove the  DVD player that  was here that  was never  used.  And replace  it with  a what?  Replace it  with nothing.  With what?  Your lost  in space  buttons thing  that you  were pushing  before?  Your switcher.  Yes.  Switcher.  You sick  of that word?  So sick  of this.  Let's  call Don.  What else  is on the  list?  Add internet  monitor and  keyboards and  mouse for  Jimmy.  What? 
[00:46:00]  I don't need  the internet  keyboard,  honestly.  And that's  exactly what  I actually  don't need  one.  It's one  thing I'll  say.  Yeah, I  never wanted  a keyboard.  I did think  a sound  machine for  a week would  be very,  very important.  It's still  an experiment  we needed  to do.  That would be  fun.  Let's call  Don.  But I don't  need it.  Thank you.  Because I have  no monitor.  Oh, boy.  Messed up.  Typing.  Fart.  Your call  has been  forwarded. 
[00:46:30]  That's a  person that  turned his  phone off.  Yeah.  He said he  was going  to be here  this morning.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Internet  access for  Sam, I guess  if I would  have moved  him over  there, he  would have  needed  internet  access.  Are you  almost done  with your  list?  No, because  your list  is starting  to get  boring.  That's a  long list.  What else  is on the  list?  HDMI  wireless  system.  Great.  Next.  Add three  mini plug.  Yep, great.  What else?  That's it.  Well, I think 
[00:47:00]  since the list  was longer,  there's two  more things  on it.  Didn't you  just say it?  It sounded like  there's a lot  more lists  coming.  I have another  studio to  consider, which  is the  producer  studio.  There's the  list.  How are you  being thrown  under a bus  if the  equipment, that  sounds like  there's a lot  of new  equipment that  needs to be  ordered, and  it's not  here.  How are you  being thrown  under the  bus?  I guess  people think  that they're  a lot smarter  than you, and  you don't know  anything because  you're not a  manager, or you  don't make the  money that they 
[00:47:30]  think you should  be making, and  they try to  just, you  know.  Are you  talking about  yourself or  me?  I don't know.  I'm trying to  find a fall  guy.  Are you  going to get  in trouble for  this?  No.  For voicing  your displeasure?  You know,  Anthony, I'm  not going to  sit here and  say, you  know, I  don't give a  fuck, but  what can I  do?  I've got to  speak up.  I'm not  going to  stay here and  take it  lightly.  You're  saying that  an injustice 
[00:48:00]  anywhere threatens  justice everywhere.  That's a good  one.  I like that.  Very good.  Thank you.  I'm sure.  So, um,  me exclaiming my  allegiance to  you guys  yesterday, I  think I  burned a  couple of  company  bridges.  Oh, no.  Once you  motherfuckers  leave, I'll  definitely have to.  What was the  pushback?  Because obviously  they didn't do  anything.  So why are you  in trouble for  that?  I'm not.  They just  started to  insinuate that 
[00:48:30]  they, you know,  why haven't you  accomplished  everything in the  studio?  Why do we have  so many people  that work around  us that are so  vague?  This is a  communication  business.  I don't  understand what  you're trying  to say.  Yes.  One of my  bosses came to  me and asked  me if everything  was done in the  studio.  And I said,  no, everything  was done in the  studio.  If everything  was done in the  studio.  You're sure he  didn't say  anything?  Yeah.  Or you're  sure he said,  I hope that  nothing was done  in the studio.  What do you  mean everything  that, everything  it's major  construction. 
[00:49:00]  What is he  talking about?  Exactly.  This is major  construction that  was supposed to  happen.  Yep.  And he went  to, he came  to you and  said, is  everything done?  Yes.  How is it  supposed to be  done?  And then I  said, I  did stuff's  not even  ordered.  No, exactly.  And that's  like, oh, if  the stuff wasn't  ordered, it  must be Mars.  So then what  they do is,  since that's  not done,  they're part of  ordering new  equipment for  you guys.  Right.  They go ahead  and they want  me to go ahead  and do busy  work. 
[00:49:30]  You know, move  things around,  give you a  wireless mic,  clean up a  little mouse.  I made that  mistake a few  times too.  Wireless mouse,  you know, try  to, you know,  there it goes  again.  And I let  them know that  that's not going  to make you  guys happy,  you know.  So, well,  you were wrong  about that.  We got a  wireless mouse and  it takes 10  minutes.  No, it takes  a lot less than  that.  It takes 10  minutes for  Jimmy to look  at a video.  Yeah, because  I used to hate  going, could you  turn the monitor 
[00:50:00]  more?  It's much more  convenient to get  up and go over  there and switch  something and have  him push two  buttons there.  But you got to  push those two  buttons at the  same time as the  other guy walks  to the TV.  What is this?  Simultaneously.  We could always  leave it on the  computer.  No, we like  looking at  Imus and our  pal Rob Bartlett  doing silly  characters.  So, nothing  was done,  obviously.  Well, a lot  of work that I  did was, for  me, I cleaned  up the wiring  underneath.  I made it a lot 
[00:50:30]  easier for me to  troubleshoot a  problem in case  there is a  problem.  Chubby shoot?  Yeah.  Chubby shoot.  All right.  I removed a lot  of wires that  are not needed.  Is that blue  wire always been  over there?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Giant blue  wire.  That's in our  dance-off area.  Yes.  So, I'm not  even going to  ask when they  are possibly  going to do  anything.  At this point,  it's silly. 
[00:51:00]  I do have an  answer for that.  It rhymes with  never.  Well, all  right.  Let's be  thankful for  what we do  have.  We got  chairs today.  Yes, we do.  Same one.  No, they're  the same chairs.  I know, but  at least they're  here.  I think this  chair might  officially be  mine.  Yours now.  Maybe. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  That's about  it.  Yeah, but the  company's working  diligently to get  the money.  A little sarcasm.  No, they  are.  A little  sarcasm.  All right,  then.  You guys are  loved throughout  the company.  Thank you,  Mars.  They really  hate us.  That's all I  ever hear, how  much they love  you guys.  I don't love  them.  Not even a  little bit.  I wouldn't even  give them a  one-night stand.  You'll get a lot  of support.  So how many 
[00:52:00]  of them actually  admit that they  hate us?  Bunch?  Dude, man,  people say so  many things to  me.  I'm like,  whatever, man.  Yeah.  Just drive on,  man.  Let's do the  fucking job.  Those guys.  I don't care what  they say on the  mic.  When you're  fucking ready to  come back,  is everything  ready?  Is everything  ready?  I purposely  fucked up your  mics this morning  because I wanted  to hear your  mouth.  I just did  it on purpose  just to be  fucking funny. 
[00:52:30]  That one I  did on purpose.  Mars is  great.  Mars is  insane.  Yeah.  There's so much  going on in  reference to this  that I have to  fucking take it  lightly a little  bit.  I go crazy.  When you guys  are not around,  you have no  idea.  No wonder he  diagnosed the  problem so  quickly.  Yes.  Like, I  know.  It's exactly  what I did.  Isn't that  like Munchhausen? 
[00:53:00]  He'll come in  and he'll  keep us sick.  Yeah.  He'll be the  one who makes  us well.  Mars wants to  be the one  that holds  us at the  door.  Putting  fucking bleach  in our soup.  Yeah, we're  trying to do  a little puppet  show.  He'll come in  and mess the  microphone up.  Let me fix it.  We'll all go  Mars was pretty  good this morning  right on top of  the mistake he  made happen.  Don was  supposed to  come in,  bring a  centerpiece,  and we were  supposed to do  something with  the videos.  What's the  centerpiece?  This is stuff  that you can  make fun of.  A nice flower  thing? 
[00:53:30]  Gaudy, nice,  something gaudy  so you can  make fun of.  There was  nothing around  so I decided  to go ahead  and fuck  with your  mics.  Wait, a  centerpiece,  why would  we?  He wanted  to do  something funny  where you  guys would  go off.  That would  be funny  if we  had a  whole  bunch  of  stuff  already  done.  That'd  be kind  of cool.  One additional  thing that they  threw in just  to be silly  would be great.  Well, he didn't  show up.  Oh.  Your call  has been  forwarded.  No one's  answering. 
[00:54:00]  What are you  going to do?  Severed head  would have been  nice.  It's a little  centerpiece.  Yeah.  Collagulated  blood.  Spike.  All right.  Well, welcome  back, boys.  Yes.  I miss you  guys.  Yes, Mars.  I'm sure you  did.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You have no  idea.  Yeah.  It's May 29th.  Holy shit.  How did that  happen?  How did that  happen?  Fucking 52  degrees out there.  53 degrees. 
[00:54:30]  I don't fucking  get it.  We're going to  get mad at it.  It's cold  weather.  Ghostbusters.  Terrible.  I just drive by  the church and  give it the  finger.  Yes.  It's God's  fault.  Lord.  I don't know.  Yeah, it was  kind of nice over  the weekend, and  then it gets  shitty and cold.  The weekend was  great.  Yes.  It sure was.  Festivities for  Memorial Day.  They don't have  Memorial Day in  Mexico.  That's fucking  weird.  Nah, they don't  want to remember 
[00:55:00]  anything.  They don't want  to memorialize  things.  I thought, like,  Mexico was a  scary place.  Yeah.  What happened?  You went to the  nice places.  Yeah, but if  it's a scary  place, why  wouldn't they go  to the nice  place to show  you how scary  Mexico is?  That was my  thought about  the whole thing.  What?  The nice places  make money, so  they make sure  that those places  are protected.  So you are  Mexican.  I'm not.  You know  everything about  it.  I don't.  I was scared  going to Mexico,  and then it turns  out everyone was  ridiculously nice. 
[00:55:30]  I would be, too.  I would be  scared.  Everyone's nice  until they  kidnap you.  Yep.  They got guns  everywhere.  Until one of the  cartels gets you.  We were on a  highway.  I guess Cancun  has it figured out  to the point where  they have a highway  just for tourists,  supposedly.  Locals aren't even  allowed on it.  Nice.  There's a highway  that goes from the  airport to all the  resorts, I guess.  Oh, wow.  And excursions and  whatnot, or if you  are a fellow worker  that has to go to a  certain resort or  whatever you're  allowed to use  this road, but  they got armed 
[00:56:00]  fucking, they got  military guys all  over the place  making sure that  it's all...  That's the safe  road.  It's just, yeah,  that they keep it  the safe road.  That I noticed.  That's nice.  That I fucking  noticed.  And the Mexican  soldiers are  badass looking.  They don't want  you fucking with  their money.  How far was the  airport to the  actual resort?  Maybe a half hour.  Oh, that's a  while.  Okay.  Half hour, but the  road was like  fucking beautiful.  Man.  But half of  those cartel  guys, a lot of  them are ex-soldiers 
[00:56:30]  and ex-cops.  Right.  Those Zetas guys  were all like  paramilitary guys.  Yeah.  But Cancun, it  sticks way out  over here.  Yeah.  You know what I  mean?  Mexico is all  like in here,  and then Cancun's  like way over  here.  How long was  the flight, by  the way, with  the kids?  Three and a  half hours.  United Airlines  could suck my  dick.  But it's going  to sound, what  I'm about to say  is going to sound  horrible, and it  just fuels the  haters.  Oh no, was  there a person  of color next  to you? 
[00:57:00]  I was traveling  with two young  kids, obviously.  One is not even  two yet, one and  a half, and my  boys just turned  four.  So I had one of  those lap  childs.  By the way, the  seatbelt thing is a  complete joke.  That's so they know  where your dead  body is.  I finally figured  it out officially.  Yeah.  Because a lap  child, I thought  if you had a  lap child, where  you could hold  your kid the  whole flight, that  you put the  seatbelt around  them as well, and  the lady goes, oh  no, no, put the 
[00:57:30]  seatbelt around  you and you  hold your baby.  So that proves  that seatbelts are  bullshit.  They ain't gonna do  anything.  Because the first  thing you're gonna  do, like your  body is gonna let  go if anything  traumatic is  happening around  you.  Your brain is  wired that way.  Yeah.  That you will  let go of your  child, believe  it or not, if  some horrific  thing is happening.  Physically, you  can't hold that  much mass that's  coming to a stop  anyway.  Right.  I saw that  proven, by the  way, in an  accident where a  Puerto Rican girl  was holding a  toolbox, and the 
[00:58:00]  guy hit the wall  and went right  through the thing.  You couldn't  have held  bubbles!  You know that  I'm fearless?  She held the  baby, you told  me it was gonna  be alright!  Yeah, they  should put a  fucking belt around  their kids.  So that proves  that seatbelts  on a plane are  completely useless  and it's  bullshit.  Yeah.  Because why, I  mean, the one  person that needs  a seatbelt is  probably a one  and a half year  old, because they  can't take care  of themselves.  And the kid is  counting on you  to hold them if  there's bad  turbulence or  something?  They just know  it's fucking, 
[00:58:30]  yeah.  That's part of  it is bullshit.  Belts are  needed, you're  fucked anyway.  So flying with  two young kids  could be a  complete and  utter nightmare.  I have the  means, thank  God, to do the  old first class  Saroo, which I  did not have  for most of  my life.  It's a nice  luxury, I'm not  going to lie to  you.  And we get up  to the gate and  it turns out I'm  bumped from first  class.  How did you get  bumped?  They said, yeah,  look at Jimmy's  face.  I'm guessing,  they said that 
[00:59:00]  they had to  downgrade the  plane.  But there was  only two of us  that were bumped  from first class.  I was one of  them.  Now, I just  wanted to sit  with my fucking  family because we  have two tiny  little kids that  need, you know,  they need  attention for the  entire three and a  half hour flight.  So I, at this  point, didn't even  give a fuck if we  were all moved to  coach, so we're all  sitting together.  So I was bumped.  And another, some  24-year-old fucking  party bimbo going to  Cancun to get some 
[00:59:30]  dick was also  bumped.  So you're United  Airlines, and the guy  behind the counter  was a quay, so it  wasn't even like he's  taking care of the  hot chick.  Although she wasn't  hot, she was dumpy.  You know, she would  probably get action  around two in the  morning when the  fucking Cancun bar  is closed.  Right.  That type of  broad.  So it's between me  and her.  So I plead my case.  I'm like, look, I  got, we got two  small kids.  I need to sit near  my family.  You guys figure 
[01:00:00]  out.  I don't even give a  fuck.  Just get us all in  the same fucking way.  And she's like,  well, I don't even  have a seat on the  plane, because they  moved me to coach, so  I know I'm going, but  just not, you know,  with my family, I  guess it's somewhere  else.  She goes, well, I'm  not even on the  plane.  I'm like, well, all  right, let's see what  they figure out, you  know.  Long story short, the  guy's like, you know,  trying to figure it  out, and it turns out  he bumps me.  I'm not in first  class with my  fucking family, which  makes the flight down  to Cancun a  complete and utter  nightmare. 
[01:00:30]  But they got me  close enough to  first class, so my  one-and-a-half-year-old  could run back and  forth down the aisle  between parents.  Between fucking  parents.  Oh, boy.  So we get on, I'm  like ready to bite my  own fucking face off,  and I...  How many seats were in  first, by the way?  How many rows?  Two and two, I guess.  So they probably lost,  there was probably a  third row.  Two and two.  But wouldn't that be,  wouldn't that mean  every row lost one?  So wouldn't there have  been a lot more of us  like that got bumped?  I had, that happened to  me one time on a paid  ticket. 
[01:01:00]  This is when I was  being flown out for a  festival.  Me and my girlfriend  at the time got kicked  out of first, and the  way they handled it was  abominable.  And they're supposed to  check and see if any  upgrades were used and  then move them out for  it.  They just, they never do  it right.  They just take the row  and cut it and fucking  boot everybody out.  Wow.  All right.  I forgot to mention,  literally two minutes  from the airport, my  one-and-a-half-year-old  puked everywhere.  Oh, Jesus.  In Ruby's car, by the  way.  For the third time.  Ruby's one of our  guys that helps us  out when we need to 
[01:01:30]  get to an airport or  something, or Jimmy  back in the day, not  back in the day, but  when Jimmy was doing  Leno, Ruby was his  guy.  And my kid puked in  the car for the third  time.  My older puked twice,  the new one has now  puked once.  Two minutes from the  airport, puke everywhere.  All over her, too, in  her hair and everything.  So imagine now pulling  up, and you've got all  these bags, and you've  got two young kids,  your whole family going  to fucking Mexico. 
[01:02:00]  International flight.  And the first thing we  have to do is figure out  how to get the puke out  of Ruby's car.  I can't.  Because you have to  do that.  You can't just say,  hey, man, thanks for  the ride.  Right, thanks for the  ride.  Now clean it up.  Because you would just  be a scumbag.  Of course.  So I'm taking baby  wipes, and I'm doing  whatever I can, knowing  it's not...  But at least I'm trying.  You think the car  smelled after you guys  left?  Oh, my God.  He was cool about it  when he picked us up  yesterday.  Oh, fuck.  I'm like, I'm really  sorry.  But then once again, I'm  just pulling out money. 
[01:02:30]  Sorry, sorry, sorry,  sorry.  How much is this  going to take?  Wait, did he pick you  up in the same car, or  was it like the older  pickup truck?  You put three seats in  like a pickup truck  in the back.  This might sound like  a repeat, because this  is the exact same story  I told a few years ago  with my son, who's now  older, who doesn't puke  anymore, thank God.  So my wife runs the  girl to the bathroom  to completely change her.  Anyway, so back to the  first class thing.  So then we get on the 
[01:03:00]  plane, I sit my wife  and my son down, and  then I'm taking my  daughter to my coach  seat.  And all of a sudden,  the fucking bimbo, they  gave her the seat over  us.  They gave her the seat  over us.  The first class seat?  Are you listening,  United Airlines?  They gave her the  first class?  They gave it to her,  and she's not a  freaking flyer or any  of that shit.  I know.  I could tell.  Although a friend might  be a little more savvy  with first class.  And then she goes to  her friend, she goes,  Oh my God, we bumped  the family? 
[01:03:30]  Because it was a whole  thing in front of the  thing, as everyone's  trying to figure it out.  And the other fucking  cunt goes, Ah, don't  worry about it, the  kid has a seat.  Meaning my son.  Yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't you as a  company go, Okay, I  don't know how this  works.  I don't know, maybe  there's a priority, but  no one knows who's  first to get that seat.  No one knows.  We're all just sitting  in front of the  counter waiting for the  company to figure this  shit out.  So wouldn't you as a  company go, Okay, we 
[01:04:00]  got a bimbo that's going  to Cancun to get some  dick, and we got a  family with two very  small kids that need,  are going to need  constant attention the  entire flight.  Right.  Wouldn't you do the  right thing and say,  you know, and bump the  chick?  You'd think.  Dude, and I was  talking about this,  when I was younger and  had no responsibility, I  was the guy that always  said, I'll give up my  fucking seat, I'll take  the next flight, what  do I get?  I was always that guy,  I didn't give a fuck,  because I had no, I  didn't have to be 
[01:04:30]  anywhere, I didn't have  any major responsibilities.  It was probably her  friend.  Her friend might have  been a platinum flyer  or something, and  talked to the agent  when you weren't there,  and said, look, I'm a  platinum flyer, and that  might have been what the  angle was.  And this guy was  acting like he cared.  And then here's the  other thing.  Then you got one of the  ticket handlers, baggage  handlers, goes up to the  booth and goes, these  three aren't going to make  it, three tickets.  So my wife goes, is one of  those mine?  And the guy goes, I don't 
[01:05:00]  worry, don't worry about  it.  So we get on the flight, I'm  in coach with the lap  child.  Yeah.  Now the kid has to go  back and forth, which, you  know, I did the best I can.  I mean, in general, she was  all right.  I don't think people have a  major complaint about my  kid on this flight, but  still, it was a major  hassle.  We get to Cancun, and we're  waiting and waiting at the  carousel.  I've got two out of my  three bags.  The third one is the big  one that has everything in  it for the two young kids 
[01:05:30]  in Cancun.  Everything, including diapers  and baby wipes and swimsuits,  all that shit.  Long story short, the third  bag didn't make the plane  either.  This is United Airlines.  Don't worry about it.  The guy told me, don't  worry about it.  Now, as a company, once  again, I have to ask United  Airlines, and I hope people  tweet United Airlines today.  When you sit there and go,  okay, we at least got to make  sure that the family with the  two very young kids going to  Cancun have their luggage? 
[01:06:00]  No, they don't care.  They don't care.  They don't give a fuck.  They're really awful.  They could care less.  That's just a fucking thing.  So they're like, I'm like,  where's our luggage?  You know, finally, to the  United people down there.  And they're like, well, let  me look.  And they're like, it takes  them to five minutes of  20,000 keystrokes that they  do.  Right.  That's just some fucking  reason.  And they, you know, they're  keystroking their asses off.  And then they go, oh, good  news.  Your luggage is in Houston. 
[01:06:30]  Why is that good?  I start in New York.  And it's coming in on the,  let me see, the 1040 p.m.  flight.  Okay.  That's great.  So when are we getting our  luggage?  Well, we'll send it over right  away after that.  But, you know, there's a bunch  of hotels.  We tell people at least two  hours after the plane.  So we didn't get the luggage  until the next fucking day.  Oh, man.  Which, if it was just me and  my wife, who gives a fuck?  But with two small kids, that 
[01:07:00]  is a nightmare.  United Airlines.  They're fucking horrible.  United Airlines.  It's really terrible.  And before everyone twists  this shit, I didn't, I don't  give a fuck about being in  first class, but I did give a  fuck about us all being  together so it would make it  easier.  Because you got two kids that  don't understand, you know,  being in an airplane, you  know?  So they need constant attention  like things to do.  And look, oh, here's a movie  for you.  Oh, here's a sticker book.  Oh, here's this.  Oh, here's the iPad.  All that shit.  Oh, here's a snack. 
[01:07:30]  That's what you have to do  for three and a half straight  hours.  Oh, my God.  So if you're not sitting  together, that could be a  complete nightmare, United  Airlines.  And they do know this shit.  So that was my experience.  I'm exhausted.  With the puking.  And then, of course, we get  the random.  We had the random check.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You've been picked for the  random check.  Uh-huh.  So now I'm holding a kid  that's now tired and cranky.  The Aryan family. 
[01:08:00]  Right.  That's the random check.  And then going through all  our shits for 10 minutes as  people are just going through.  And all that overhead space  is being taken for the, and  while your bags are being  looked at, all that space that  you're going to need for the  overhead is being taken.  Oh, it's just fun.  No, that was when we landed.  Oh.  They did the random check  when we landed.  Oh, for like drugs or  something?  Yeah, because that's what  we're doing in Cancun with  the young.  Yeah.  Young family.  Quite a gimmick.  Thank you, United Airlines.  I will never be flying you  again.  And I highly recommend that 
[01:08:30]  other people, you know,  pick another airline.  Because they don't give a  fuck, especially if you have  a family.  Yeah.  Because when you're just, as  a company, you would, you  would, you should just assess  the situation.  Okay.  I get this bimbo.  In the end, she don't give  a fuck.  She just wants her dick in  Cancun.  And you've got the young  family that obviously needs  to sit together because their  kids are too young to take  care of themselves.  There's no.  And we got one C left.  They don't care.  They really don't care.  They're awful, dude.  Oh, weeks. 
[01:09:00]  Huh?  Well, Mars.  Hair waves.  Mars was playing a video  from World Star Hip Hop  of a fight.  Yeah.  And the aftermath of the  fight is the street is  strewn with weaves.  Wow, look at that.  Look at all the weaves  all over the fucking  street.  That looks like the  seaweed that was on the  beach.  Oh, shit.  Some.  No, they don't care.  They don't see it as  people.  They just see it as, you  know, things that they  got to put on the plane.  How many things do we 
[01:09:30]  fit?  There was another girl  that was bumped and she  was crying her eyes out.  Oh, boy.  People are weird.  She was crying her eyes  out.  I'm like, oh, that sucks  to probably bumper her to  another flight.  She was crying because she  had a sitting coach.  I understand.  I was crying, not  crying, but I was because  I, you know, I knew it  would be just more of a  nightmare than it was  going to be being, you  know, having the whole  family separated around  the plane.  She knows how nice 
[01:10:00]  first class is.  But she was crying and  I'm like, oh, that sucks  that maybe they're going  to get married down there  or their honeymoon and  now she's got to wait  for another flight.  I can't get a glass of  wine.  And then she's like,  well, I guess it'll be  okay.  I'll sit back there.  I couldn't believe it.  Ah, poor girl.  Not getting her  complimentary cookie and  God damn it. 
[01:10:30]  I told you at airlines  too.  I'm like, look, man, got a  radio show.  So, you know, they don't  care because the employees  have zero upper management  might care, but they have  zero attachment to their  car.  I've never dealt with worse  employees than United right  now.  And then there was a  stewardess and there's the,  you know, the personal  touch.  She goes to me, she goes,  she goes, hey, man, you  know, I'll at least give  you some of the first  class, you know, amenities.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, that's nice. 
[01:11:00]  Thank you.  You know, so he goes  like, you know, we have a,  we have an extra meal or  whatever and I'll make sure  you're taken care of.  But then another stewardess  is like questioning me.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  Why is this a stupid  fucking meal?  She goes, this is for  first class passengers.  And she knew that I was  bummed.  It wasn't even like, it  wasn't even like, did you  get the meal?  Yeah, I got the meal, but  I've tried to use the  first class bathroom and I  was denied by this lady.  I'm like, you're kidding  me. 
[01:11:30]  I have to, I have to check  on my kids at the very  least.  Well, you know what?  You can't be having coach  riffraff up in that  bathroom.  But common sense took over  because the one stewardess  that I could tell was a  nice lady.  Most of them just suck.  Yeah.  We all know that.  But the one lady, I got  her attention.  I'm like, she won't let me  go into first class to  check them in.  And then she had to, she  talked to the other one  because I had to at least  keep going back to make  sure everything was all  right.  Plus I had to keep  passing the kid. 
[01:12:00]  Oh my God.  Because the kid's  attention span is five  minutes.  So you hold it for five  minutes.  Then she needs to go do  something else for five  minutes.  I'm not going to ask the  guy next to me.  That would be hilarious.  So then the stewardess  that I, you know,  overstepped her boundaries.  Now she's giving me dirty  looks the whole time.  Like, really?  Well, that's first class  for a reason, my friend.  Your company did this.  I didn't do anything.  I booked everything  properly.  You couldn't.  Yeah, that is irritating  when you're booked in  there and you know you're  booked in there and they 
[01:12:30]  still treat you like,  all right, well, you're  out now.  Right.  That's my worst.  The way they handle it,  I had that once going to  Vegas, there was tremendous  storms and it was, uh, it  was, uh, it was the  equipment changed and they  just couldn't make it back  in.  Yeah.  The way they handled it was  what was so reprehensible.  Yeah.  Like, I understand equipment  changes and there's nothing  you can do a plane.  It's a different plane, but  they were such scumbags  about it.  Well, how about this?  All right.  You know, all right.  I'm going to coach.  That's fine.  But how about you at least 
[01:13:00]  try to get their luggage on  the, on the plane?  Yeah.  Or was their goal to  really make it hurt?  Again, they don't know  that it's your luggage or  this or that.  They just see it as, they  just see it as things.  But when the guy came up  and said, these three  aren't going to make it  because obviously that's  a regular thing that  happens.  My wife said, wait, is  one of those mine?  The guy behind the  counter could at least  said, well, let me at  least check.  Oh, he didn't want to  deal with that.  No.  Why would he want to  deal with that?  His response was, don't  worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Exactly. 
[01:13:30]  Because even if it was  her, there's nothing he  could do about it and she  would have yelled at him  and not why he didn't  hear it.  They don't give a fuck.  There's not even a  number you can call.  He's just sucking on a  lollipop.  He's like, I'm going to  give you a voucher.  How much is the voucher  for?  $250.  I'm like, I go, it's not  about the money.  I don't want to, you  know.  Yeah.  But I said, it's not  about the money.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't give the voucher  to Kenny or something.  I don't give a fuck.  Voucher.  Yes, Kenny.  Kenny.  Do you know who Jeff  Smizek is? 
[01:14:00]  He's the president of  United.  He was the president of  United.  Now he's the president of  United Continental.  Right.  Oh, no, he was  Continental then.  He's the CEO of  United.  Right.  Is he the guy that used  to come on the video  screens on Continental?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And?  May I read an article from  the Huffington Post dated  May 2nd of this year?  Oh.  What is that?  I just, I don't know.  It's his underwater  expedition, I guess, is 
[01:14:30]  happening.  Mars.  Mars' phone was ringing.  Mars, who's ringing you  this early?  Oh, he just pointed over  his shoulder.  Who's pointing?  Could be anybody.  Yeah.  He's just pointed to  Manhattan.  Could be an uncle when  he's six.  See the vagueness?  Who's calling you?  He points.  Somebody in the shop.  What do they want?  I guess they need some  to go.  All right.  So, go do nothing over  there.  You're done doing  nothing over here.  Oh, shit. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, Mars.  We love you.  That was nice.  Was it?  Yes.  All right.  Go ahead, Kenny.  So, what did the HuffPo  article say?  Yeah, Jeff Smizek.  Well, it's an article  entitled, Why United  Jeff Smizek is Perhaps  the Worst CEO in the  Business.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  All right.  I thought it was going  to be a little twist  like how they give you  the personal touch or  something.  He does stink, by the  way, Jeff Smizek.  Yeah.  And the gist of the 
[01:15:30]  article is no one has  trust in him.  Not the investors, the  employees, or the  customers.  Wow.  He's sunk.  But it doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't.  He's lousy.  Continental was decent  before, and then when  United became part of  it, he's from  Continental.  My personal experience  with United Airlines  was awful, and it  goes down to Jim's  point.  Things happen.  We all know that, but  it's how you handle  those situations that  will piss off your 
[01:16:00]  fucking customers.  Well, you know what  happened with you?  It got all jeffed up.  That's what United,  their phrase for when  things get fucked up,  they say it's all jeffed  up.  Wow.  According to this  article.  According to the  article.  I will make sure I  don't fly United Airlines  unless I have absolutely  no options.  That's how they get  you, by the way.  I'd rather go on one  of those fucking  airplanes that still have  the Razor disposal 
[01:16:30]  and the ashtrays and  the armrests.  Yes, I'd rather fly in  those fucking planes.  Continental used to be  known as the airline  that built pride.  You know, it is all  these, someone on  Twitter mentioned it,  but it's these mergers.  I mean, I guess that's  the way it goes, but it  makes it harder because  they know you have no  options.  Yeah.  Like American, I mean,  I've had great  experiences with  American.  I'll tweet something  good, 500 people will  tweet me and go, I've  had horrible American  experience.  There's only so many  airlines left, 
[01:17:00]  made for airlines.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like  American, United,  American.  Yeah, didn't, is  Delta, Delta still  Delta's around.  My in-laws flew  Delta.  Virgin America.  Yeah, but they  don't do enough  routes to Virgin  America.  They fly like, you  know, from New  York to San  Francisco, but they  stop in China  first.  What are you doing?  What are you  doing?  Exactly.  We flew right over  where I want to go.  Oh, the mouse is  back.  Oh. 
[01:17:30]  I'm going to throw  it all morning.  Yeah, so.  There's an opportunity  there for other  airlines.  It's the little  things.  Yeah, always the  little thing.  That drives you  crazy.  Because you can  handle, when we  got booted, me and  my girlfriend at that  time got booted.  It was a paid ticket  because HBO flew us  out for the, it was a  Vegas festival.  Right.  When they booted, it  was the way they  treated us just like  such pieces of shit.  Like if they would  have just said, look,  we understand this, but  they were just such  scumbags about it that  I hated them. 
[01:18:00]  And I wrote, I wrote  letters and I sent  them and I wanted to  return receipts to  every off.  I went fucking  bananas and my  girlfriend would mock  me.  She goes, well, I  guess the whole team  is on it.  I eventually got a  response back.  Did you?  Good for you.  Months later with  all the stuff they did,  they're like, we  actually changed policy  because of your letter.  Stop.  I still have that  letter where they  said that they  changed it in the  policy when they  boot people out.  Right.  What are you going  to do?  I got to just, you 
[01:18:30]  know, I think I need  to do something about  this.  There you go.  Wow.  Don't jeff it up,  Kenny.  Oh, you're pitching  a fit.  I was.  Nah, I was, I was  extremely nice through  the whole thing.  You should have  pitched a fit.  Because I assumed  they were, they were  hearing me.  I was assuming  they were listening  to me and they  would do, they  would try to do  something.  Oh, no.  And then in the  end, you realize,  like you said, you're  just a number.  They didn't give a  fuck.  It's the thing on  their machine.  You know, it's not 
[01:19:00]  our fucking problem.  You're going to  Cancun in the worst  way possible and you  will not have  luggage when you  arrive.  Thank you, United  Airlines.  Put that in your  commercial.  Because that sounds  terrific.  Yeah.  Hey, I bet those  people on that  Malaysian plane wish  it was just a  missing luggage.  True.  Boy, do you  think about that  plane when you're  in the sky?  Oh, boy.  Who's not?  Every little  bumperoo, you're  like, what the  fuck?  And then if you're  over water a little  too long, you're  like, when are we  going to see land 
[01:19:30]  again?  Or is this guy  heading south on  last year?  Oh, fuck.  Did you give the  pilot a good look,  see if you had  crazy eyes?  Oh, I had that  flight map on the  entire time.  Yeah, where are we  going?  There are a couple  like half circles.  I'm like, what's  that about?  Where's he going?  Is he redirecting  this thing?  Oh, boy, are you  on full alert when  you fly now.  Full alert.  You know, this is  exactly what, this 
[01:20:00]  one guy in this  article that Kenny  pointed out, it's  from HuffPo.  HuffPo.  And this guy said  he was a journalist  and he saw a guy  who worked for  United whose name  he's not giving.  And he just struck  up a conversation.  The guy had no  idea he was a  journalist, so of  course he's not  giving the guy his  real name.  Right.  And he said he  asked about how  much he loved his  job and the guy  thought it was  great.  And he goes,  when I asked  about Jeff  Smizek, who I  think really does  stink as well, he  said the guy was  like a 20-minute  confessional.  And he spoke  of cutbacks on  meals that were  so harsh that  long flights 
[01:20:30]  routinely consist  only of an  omelet made of  God knows what  and a dried-out  piece of sausage  and a flimsy  plastic.  They really do  suck.  Shit.  Yeah.  Their face.  And they were  the first airlines  to take little  stuff like blankets  and they said it  was during the  anthrax or  whatever.  Wasn't that  what it was?  Oh, really?  Was that the  excuse?  Because of  something?  There's always  an excuse why  they're not doing  their cutbacks.  Horrendous.  Instead of just  telling you it's  cutbacks.  It's cheaper.  It's cutbacks.  Though they say  something like,  well, we don't  want you to get 
[01:21:00]  anthrax on your  way to, you  know, Disney.  Right.  Because of the  blanket.  Right.  And how is it  good news when  they go, good  news, your  luggage is in  Houston?  How is that  good news?  Could have been  in like Alaska.  All right.  Fair enough.  Good news.  We found your  luggage.  Oh, well, I  guess I should be  happy that you  found my luggage.  It's south of the  latitude you  started at.  Right.  That's kind of  good.  It is heading  south.  Yes.  You're south.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Oh, very good  news.  It's going to  arrive tonight.  Weather permitting.  I heard that.  Weather permitting.  Because there are  thunderstorms in the  area.  Should land at  940.  See if it was on  the plane I was  on.  And it would have  been here at the  same time.  That's good news.  I think good news  is.  That's good news.  You're going to  Cancun and your  luggage is also  going to Cancun.  On the same  machine.  That would be  good news, I  think.  But stupid me,  maybe not.  What else do  they say in that  article? 
[01:22:00]  I'm just, I'm  just, I'm looking  at this.  It's hard to talk  with my teeth or  grinding.  Yeah.  Really?  Because you fly a  lot.  I don't, I don't  fly that much.  And I certainly  will not be flying  United Airlines  anytime soon.  Just talking about  saving the best for  last.  The company cannot  perform to  its highest  aspirations without  thank you, without  customers trusting.  Trusting?  They say the  customers have to  trust and they  don't.  Trust this guy.  They say everything  from flying cross  country on old  planes with no  power adapters, no 
[01:22:30]  personal video  screens, Wi-Fi that  has been in  development since  Eastern was  dismantled.  Eastern Airlines.  And uncomfortable  cramped seating.  Their seats on  United are, they're  terrible.  Yeah.  I'm so glad that  Kenny brought in  this article.  Everything's  jeffed up.  jeffed up.  I'm nice to see  the employees hate  this guy too  though.  Because I guess  they're dealing  with all this.  Maybe he won't  last then.  Oh, he's been  there for a long  time, man.  Yeah.  He's been there  for quite a while.  Hemispheres, their  magazine.  You don't like 
[01:23:00]  Hemispheres magazine?  I certainly don't.  No.  Subscribe to it at  home.  No, I don't.  I prefer the movie.  He should take his  golden parachute right  into the Indian  ocean.  Yes, he should.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him and  fuck United  Airlines.  Damn.  Right.  And I, if the  guy wasn't a  quay, I almost  would give it to  him like, okay, I  see what he's  doing.  The girl is, you  know, young, on  her way to  Cancun.  Right.  You know, he's  thinking with his  dick a little bit. 
[01:23:30]  But he was, he  was definitely a  quay.  Yeah.  Which is  whatever.  That's fine.  But, you know.  But, yeah.  So, so you can't  even use that as  an excuse is what  I'm saying.  Right.  That he was  trying to pick  up on the hot  chick.  Right.  Yeah.  No, she wasn't  hot.  Well, she, like  I said, she was  a little dumpy.  I'll give her  about a five.  With a ten, she  might push up to  a five and a  half.  She puts that  fucking bikini  on, gets a few  fucking, a few  shots of tequila  in her.  A lot of tequila  down there.  She's fine. 
[01:24:00]  A lot of tequila  down there.  Go her.  Damn.  All right.  I think with  airlines, people  just assume like,  well, you know  what?  I got from  point A to  point B.  So why make  a fuss?  That's a big  part of it.  You want it to  be safe, but  yeah, I do  agree to a point.  No, no, I don't  think.  But a lap child  and a kid that  just turned four,  that's a different  situation.  And then, you  know, making sure  the family doesn't  have their luggage  when they get to  Cancun.  That's crazy to 
[01:24:30]  me.  If I flew to  Cancun by myself  or with my wife,  we didn't have  luggage, I don't  care.  You go to the  bar, you have a  couple of drinks,  have dinner, who  cares?  Get a toothbrush  from the  fucking, you  know, the  store there.  But with,  whatever, it's a  broken record now,  but there you go,  that was my  experience.  Damn.  How was the  flight home?  Perfect.  And they gave  you a $250 
[01:25:00]  voucher.  I lost that  already, to be  honest with you.  I'm going to be  a bag of shells.  I really did lose  that already.  Yeah, you lost  your money.  We were trying to  pack up yesterday.  When they do that  to you and they  bump you, they  should just offer  you a free flight  somewhere.  Like, just do  the right thing.  Yeah.  And I read in  this article that  they wait to feed  you on that  airline because  then by the time  they feed you,  you'll eat  anything that  they have.  That's what  they said.  And I noticed  it does take a  while for the  food to come  out.  I couldn't tell 
[01:25:30]  you the last  time I even  thought that I  would get  something halfway  decent on a  plane to eat.  Whether it was  in first class or  coaching, you're  trying to eat  something.  You just know  you can eat  something shitty.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you  pretty much  just...  I don't even  know when that  changed.  There was a  time you got  on a plane and  you're like,  oh wow, this is  kind of nice.  First class?  Even their, you've  joked about over the  years, Jimmy, the  warm cookie, even  that was shitty on  the plane. 
[01:26:00]  How do you fuck up  a warm cookie?  The smell of a  warm cookie, though.  But they were  warm, but they were  shitty fucking  cookies even.  I was going to  Atlanta one time  and I'd fallen  asleep finally, and  I woke up to the  smell of cookies, and  the flight attendant  was a big guy, and  he had given out the  cookies, but I  hadn't gotten mine, and  I remember having to  sheepishly call him  over and say, sorry,  I didn't get my  cookie.  You must have  looked stupid.  He wanted to put  his cookie on his, he 
[01:26:30]  wanted to tape it to  his knuckles and feed  it to me repeatedly.  He was none too  pleased with fat tits  requesting a cookie.  He probably wanted  to eat it.  Anyway.  But I must say, the  people in Cancun, I  couldn't believe how  nice people were down  there.  Like, really nice.  You go to some of  these resorts in the  Caribbean or wherever,  like the Bahamas  especially, the locals  are shitty people. 
[01:27:00]  They are.  But the people in  Cancun, they were  unbelievably nice.  How was the way?  Because I was  worried about Mexico.  You hear all the,  you know, oh, you're  going to Mexico?  Why would you do  that?  That's crazy.  The wedding was  great.  My brother-in-law  pulled off a  destination wedding.  I didn't think that  was possible.  Yeah.  Because when I was  getting married, I  looked into it.  I'm like, this is not  possible.  Because you got old  people, you got this  and that.  Oh, man.  It turned out it was a  blast.  That's why I called, 
[01:27:30]  that's why a long time  ago I called them the  Philly crew.  Everyone just goes  together.  Yeah.  I can't get my  family to go together  anywhere.  But the Philly people,  man, they're truly a  crew.  My brother-in-law was  getting married and they  all, they all went.  Wow.  Neighbors, friends,  family.  There were 60 people  there.  That's crazy to try to  fucking coordinate.  Because this place that  we went to, we went to  Azul, which was, they  do a very, very good  job down there, but the  beach is, they set up  the beach nice, really 
[01:28:00]  nice, but the water is,  you know, you could find  much better water.  Yeah.  Much better water than  we had.  But besides that, they do  a very nice job down  there.  And it's wedding after  wedding going through  that place.  And you see other  destination weddings and  it's sad.  It's like the couple and  like four people and then  they got like somebody from  the resort reading, reading  the, the readings.  So there's no personal  touch.  It's just like, and, and,  and for eternity, you  and, you know, but, uh, 
[01:28:30]  my brother, man, you  know, even flew in, you  know, one of our friends  to do the service and  everything.  60 fucking people.  How long did you stay?  Like the wedding was  like one night.  Well, we did like, we  did everything you do.  You did like a rehearsal  dinner.  There was, there was a, uh,  a bonfire and, uh,  then the wedding, full  wedding, full DJ, full  everything.  It was amazing.  He pulled it off.  I, I couldn't do it.  That would be cool.  It was awesome.  Really awesome. 
[01:29:00]  And the weather was  great, but that would  have been cool.  What?  Just going away like  that.  It seems like it's cool  just to hang on with  the whole family.  Yeah.  Literally the whole  family was there on, on  that side, that side of  my family.  I mean, I went to a  really cool place, but  not.  Where did you go?  Is that my apartment?  I went to my  apartment.  You were, you said  you were going to try  to go away.  I had too much, uh,  too much going on  pre-production shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's, uh, yeah,  it seems like more fun 
[01:29:30]  than it used to, to go  away.  I'm going to go away.  I was dreading it just  because of the small  kids.  And then certainly  United Airlines and  making, make that any  easier.  I'm going to say  United Airlines sucks  about a hundred times  today.  And I hope people  tweet them.  They don't give a  fuck.  Yeah.  They won't care.  Well, when we  finally got there,  then it was, it  was a really, it  was a really nice  week.  Really nice.  It was good to be  away.  Did you get this?  I was in Cancun.  That's what I'm  right.  You've been to  Cancun.  I did that joke  about 50 sent me on  the plane together  where I ran out of  things to say to him 
[01:30:00]  when I, before we  backed out of the  gate, I used to do  it in my act, but  it's true.  Oh wait, that was  the MTV gig.  That was, uh, yeah,  that was when we  were off the air, like  2003.  Right.  I did two pilots  in Cancun and, um,  there was really, it  was fucking hot.  It was like a hundred  degrees on the beach,  a hundred and maybe  15 degrees.  And, uh, I was  under lights and I  had to shit.  It was the first  time the water got  to me.  So I drank cappuccino  the night before.  Oh, and boy, did I  have, I was running  into a public bathroom  making duties and 
[01:30:30]  then running back  doing a spring break  pilot, which went  nowhere.  Terrible.  The water thing is  scary.  I just had my  first, like, I'm so  dehydrated.  Let's just put it  that way.  Cause you're fully  aware.  Cause everyone warns  you do not drink the  water in Mexico and  they're sick of hearing  it at this resort we  went to, they had to  say, our water is  filtered.  You're okay.  Cause supposedly  Americans going to  Mexico is not good.  We don't have  something in our  body that could 
[01:31:00]  defend against their  water for whatever  reason.  Somebody else can  explain it better.  So you are beyond  paranoid the entire  time.  And then people  like, don't eat the  fruits and vegetables  cause they, they  wash them with the  tap water.  So you're, you're,  you're so careful  brushing your teeth.  Yeah.  All of a sudden my  wife goes, did you  run your toothbrush  under this faucet?  I'm like, yeah.  Bottled water.  You got to bottle  water everything.  Did you actually  drink the water that  they said that they  filter or no?  Yeah.  I find cause you're  getting so dehydrated.  You gotta do 
[01:31:30]  something.  But I am so down on  my water right now.  Did they have  bottled water for  water?  Um, yeah, but then  you weren't sure where  it was bottled cause it  was names you've never  seen before.  Oh.  So that made you  paranoid.  Well, Juarez Springs.  But happy to say that, uh,  no one got the shits  down there.  Yeah.  I got them only that  one day.  It was the night before  I shot.  I went out and had it  coming back from Brazil.  I got very, very sick  too.  It might've been  something I ate or  drank down there.  It might've been  someone you ate. 
[01:32:00]  I got what they call  the crud.  I mean, I got a  terrible cold from  making out with all  those hookers in the  fucking back.  The crud.  They call it the crud.  You got the crud.  You don't want to get  the crud.  You certainly don't.  I remember almost  vomiting online in the,  uh, just like on a  customs line.  I was like, I'm going  to throw up here on  the floor.  I was going to ask you  when you got the shits  and was it one of those  where you have to find  a bathroom almost every  15 minutes?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  I was shooting.  It was just the,  uh, 
[01:32:30]  it was terrible.  Pissing out your ass.  Yeah.  My, uh, it got a  little loosey there.  I'm not going to lie  to you.  Day four or five, it  was getting a little  loosey, but, uh,  but I held strong.  I did all right.  But you are over  paranoid about water  down there, man.  Taking showers, you  know, cause you might  do a little rinse in  the shower.  You're in there.  What the hell?  Right?  No.  Nope.  It's kind of bug.  And then you feel like  you're insulting them  because you're like,  is your water filtered?  We come from America 
[01:33:00]  with clean water.  Is this water filtered?  You filthy people.  How is your water,  you dirtbags?  You know how people  always say, why does  the rest of the world  hate us?  Yeah.  Man, I woke up every  morning to see a tractor  on the beach removing  the seaweed.  Right on.  Cause Americans,  cause mostly Americans  are at this resort.  We don't like our seaweed.  We don't like seaweed  on our beaches.  Unless it's wrapped  around our sushi.  Right.  The only way we like it.  But they, 
[01:33:30]  I believe it's a full-time  job in this area  for Cancun.  And they're just piling  up seaweed at the end  of the beach.  Yeah.  So, so us fucking  Americans don't,  you know,  Swim comfy.  Walk through the seaweed  to get to our warm water.  Where they're, uh...  And you know these guys  live in like horrible  shanties and shit  when they're not working  at the resort.  Did, um...  Were there jellyfish  in the water or anything?  I didn't really, uh,  go in over my head.  It was kind of... 
[01:34:00]  I mean, like I said,  the resort itself  was great  and the pools  and the restaurants  and the bars were awesome  but the water was like...  None of us really  went in too far.  It was kind of like  there was rocks  and like that...  I don't even know what...  It was like sand  but like bumps.  Like bumps that you  didn't know if it was  a creature or...  Like moguls?  It was like moguls.  Moguls would like,  um, you know,  sea plants and stuff.  Oh, growing out of them.  So it was...  It was, uh...  Not the best terrain.  Yeah.  I've been in better water 
[01:34:30]  but the resort itself  and like I said,  the people were amazing.  They were really, really nice.  And, you know,  when you have small kids  it's all about the pool anyway.  You know,  you just spend many,  many hours at the pool.  What about the pool water?  I was worried about that.  Out of the chlorine probably.  Yeah.  I figured as much.  Do it, yeah.  I figured as much.  Yeah.  But the entire week,  did you drink the water?  No.  When did you come back?  Yesterday.  Yeah.  Went to a Mayan temple 
[01:35:00]  and a water park and...  Water park?  Yeah, it was awesome.  It was a good trip.  Very nice.  So congratulations  to my brother-in-law.  He really,  he pulled it off, man.  Good job.  Holy fuck.  I was dreading it  because I'm like,  no one has pulled off  the destination wedding,  I don't think.  I've never been to one.  They did it.  Yeah, that was my first.  I never invited to one.  No.  That was my first.  A bunch of fucking  broke-ass motherfuckers  that I know  that got married.  Nothing.  The last wedding  I got invited to was 
[01:35:30]  they don't have money down there.  No.  They don't have a lot of money.  They still don't.  No, I mean,  broke-ass people like to, um...  I didn't go there.  To do their own wedding.  Like, they put on  some cheap shit fucking wedding.  Right, right.  That's all my dumb friends.  Did you guys just hear  Iraq or no?  No, no.  He said Bob Kelly's wedding  I was invited to in Hawaii.  He said you were never  invited to a destination wedding.  Oh, yeah, that doesn't  really count.  That was a fake invite.  And then he gets mad  that we didn't go.  Like, who could just  pick up and go to Hawaii?  He streamed it on a webcam  for everyone.  And then he got mad  that we started to sell him  and ridiculed him.  Yeah.  Did you watch?  Of course we did, yeah. 
[01:36:00]  All the comics sat there  and watched it  just to attack them verbally.  Oh, that's...  He couldn't hear it  but we were just  watching him on the beach.  That is hilarious.  But that's the last group  you want watching you  on a video monitor  in the room.  But that's what  I'm talking about.  So it was him and his wife  and who else was there?  I don't remember, honestly.  Yeah.  I don't remember.  Jimmy, you always say  you want to go on vacation  but never go anywhere.  Why?  That's Ralph in New York.  He's right.  The reason I didn't  I wanted to go to Dubai  or something this week  is because I'm actually  leaving early today 
[01:36:30]  because I'm shooting  today, tomorrow, and Monday  and it was simply  lead up stuff for work.  I had to stay  to do castings  and all that stuff.  Yeah.  It's hard to find  an actress who's willing  to put two fingers  in your hiney.  It's not even part  of the script.  Let's see.  They do filter the water  in all the high-end  Mexican resorts. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, they probably  don't have people  getting sick  and not coming back  or spreading the word.  Don't go there.  Yeah.  No, it's obvious.  Everyone knows about it.  Everybody there  has been warned.  I don't know what it is.  It's mostly Mexico  because if you go  to the Bahamas  or anywhere else,  they don't...  I drink right out  of the tap.  No problem?  No, I never had an issue.  But down there,  they're like,  man, don't drink  the fucking water.  What did people do  years ago  before, like,  bottled water?  They just shit.  They just shit  their fucking brains out?  Yeah, but you're like,  yeah, whatever.  That's a part of it.  I'm looking at a palm tree, 
[01:37:30]  so I guess it's cool.  Wow.  As long as you're  looking at a palm tree,  you'll accept a good,  you know,  water shit.  Poor Montezuma.  He's just known  for diarrhea now.  Oh!  Crazy.  There was...  I didn't see this,  unfortunately,  and if I had a video of this,  this would have been  a major viral video.  So, you know,  they have the pool bar  and stuff.  A lot of these resorts  have the pool bar.  This girl got so fucking drunk.  Not one of our crew,  by the way.  Although they had,  you know,  they had their fun,  certainly.  So I'm not saying,  you know, 
[01:38:00]  they're beyond,  you know,  getting crazy.  This girl was over-served  or over-served herself.  She's in the pool bar.  She waddles up...  This is how it was told to me.  She waddles up to the filter  and just fucking power boots  into the filter  as much as she can  into the filter,  but a lot of it  around the filter  still in the pool.  Fucking power boots  her ass off  and then waddles back  to the bar  to get another drink. 
[01:38:30]  What a trooper.  As the puke  just slowly starts  to dissipate  into the pool.  Fuck.  Don't they have to  close the pool  when she...  You would assume.  Something like that happens?  You would assume.  But supposedly  it was...  It wasn't pretty.  She went right back up...  Bellied right...  Right back up  to the bar  and had another one.  Good girl.  She's not gonna  fucking ruin her chance  of getting a dick  in her.  That's just because  she's a little drunk. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  She's gonna make out  there's a piece of ham  on her tooth.  Well, that's not nice.  No.  It takes his dog  face jumping.  Poor dog doesn't  know what the fuck.  Dog probably would love that.  They let the stick  their dumb heads  out the window.  Oh, yeah.  A road...  We drive...  That's my dog impression.  Yes.  You might come out  of a plane  with a stupid dog.  They'd probably  go crazy for it.  Yeah, that might  be the ultimate  for him.  Aw.  Wow, another collision.  Didn't we almost  collide in midair? 
[01:39:30]  737 in a cargo plane.  Where was this?  Like how it's  1,320 feet  and it's like,  well, that's close.  That's not close.  It's not even close  for the part.  400 feet.  Oh, now they're  saying 400 feet.  That's close.  Come on.  That's not close.  Two United planes.  Oh, really?  Oh.  How close?  Doggy.  400 feet.  That's fucking close.  That's real close.  That's really close.  That's really close.  That's really far  if it's your penis  and a vagina.  If that's two planes  that are moving,  that's really close. 
[01:40:00]  On the way down  when I was separated  from my family  thanks to United Airlines,  I forgot I was  sitting next to  a 40-year-old guy  that was flying  for the first time.  Oh, shit.  So I forgot  this part of the story.  It's not that great,  but so I got  my lap child on me  and now I have  to talk to the guy  to my right  and calm him down  because he's flying  for the first time.  Was he freaking out?  Completely freaking out.  40 years old.  Normal working dude.  It didn't seem like  there was anything 
[01:40:30]  wrong with him  or anything.  So I had to explain.  You should have  fucking said things  like when the landing gear  came out.  I was like,  I've flown a lot.  I've never heard  that before.  God just fucking  shit himself.  Yeah, you act panicky.  Oh, fuck.  What was that?  Unfortunately,  he was sitting  next to Greg Hughes,  you know.  If he was sitting  next to, you know,  Opie.  The Opster.  Well, the Opster  would have just,  you know,  been silly and stupid.  There's three of me.  Yes, there is.  Anyway, 
[01:41:00]  should we take a break?  We started early today.  Drug maker may sell  Cialis over the counter.  Yeah, why wouldn't they?  I didn't mean to jump  on that so quickly.  Oh, what is that for?  Would they just sell  like a weaker version  of it?  Because isn't there  some pretty serious  warnings with Cialis  if you've got heart issues?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe it's not any  different than other stuff.  I love the stuff  that's going over  the counter now.  Like the anti-hit,  the anti-history.  No, I don't take 
[01:41:30]  that stuff anymore.  Oh.  I'm cured.  Yes.  It was one of those  things for your sinuses.  Oh, all right, right.  And now it's over the counter.  Yeah.  Oh, God, this is why  I love my in-laws.  I was just telling  the puking story  in the pool.  Yeah.  My, fuck it,  it's my father-in-law.  He goes, he just texted me,  she was a fat bitch  English cunt.  Oh.  So she wasn't even hot?  That puked into the filter.  He was there.  Oh, she wasn't even hot?  No.  Oh, tell her to get 
[01:42:00]  the fuck out then.  Yeah, get out of the pool,  you vomiting fatso.  Puked.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Back to your room  and sleep it off, you pig.  God, I wish I had a video of that.  That would have been terrific.  Anyway.  What were you saying, Cialis?  What were you saying, Jimmy?  Yeah, so a lot of this stuff  is going over the counter.  Yeah, the, uh,  what's, I can't remember  what it's called.  It's the stuff I take  for my occasional,  my allergies.  No spray.  Yeah, that's now over the counter  for a while,  but you have to,  you can only get it so often  because of meth  and they can use part of it  to make methamphetamines  so you can only get a, 
[01:42:30]  like, you have to show  your license  and you can only get it  like once a pill a day  is take.  It's just...  But Cialis, over the counter,  that sounds, uh...  Phenomenal?  Phenomenal, of course.  I'm walking around  with boners.  But it sounds  a little scary to me  because you see  all the warnings.  It's like anything else, though.  You know,  there is some cold medication  that people can't take  because of physical reasons.  Right.  You know,  you've got to do  your little research  even if it's over the counter.  Hmm.  But if you want a boner,  there you go.  Belly up to the old  pharmacy counter. 
[01:43:00]  What is that going to be?  Well, just...  I don't know.  Just wondering.  You'll know it's done  when fucking...  It's just boners  up and down the hallway.  Everyone's just walking around  with boners all the time.  Even if you're not using  your boner,  it's kind of nice to...  Yeah, just to have one.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Stack them up  in a Pez dispenser  and just go around  popping them.  Right.  Pushing the buttons  on the fucking soda machine  with your dick.  Sometimes it just feels nice  to be a little full 
[01:43:30]  in front of your pants.  A little plump.  In front of your pants.  Plump up a bit.  Just walk in a meeting,  put your arms on your hips  and just stand there.  Oh, yeah.  Let the meeting commence.  Point it down  so it's really pressing hard  against your fucking pant leg.  Oh, what's better than that?  Looks impressive.  I caught an older lady  checking out my package  yesterday  at the baggage carousel  waiting for my bags.  I hope you scolded her.  I looked at her twice  and went,  holy fuck,  I think that old broad  is checking out my package.  Jesus.  I had sweatpants on.  Oh, no. 
[01:44:00]  Were you tenting?  No.  I just...  She looked at the back  or the front?  It's like,  holy fuck,  I think that old broad  is checking out my package.  Should I have underwear on?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Boxers or?  Boxer briefs.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Because if you wear sweats  sometimes with no underwear,  you got to watch it.  Sometimes you don't even know.  You look down and go,  hey, my dick's sticking out.  How did that happen? 
[01:44:30]  I didn't feel a draft or nothing.  How did that happen?  What the fuck?  I just...  I don't know.  I had good presentation, I guess.  Yeah.  I beg its carousel will do it.  Oh.  I'm embarrassed.  Did you tighten up your ass cheeks  and make it jump a little bit?  I would have made it jump towards it.  Jump.  I pushed my hips forward slightly.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like,  hell, if you're going to look,  you might as well get the full...  The full goodness.  Yeah, give it a little...  I would have hiked them up higher.  Yeah.  With the Fred Mertz fashion. 
[01:45:00]  When a girl grabs my dick like that,  I like twitching out,  you're a cunt,  in Morse code.  Makes me feel good.  Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot.  She can see it in my eyes, though.  Twitching.  Exactly.  And she'll probably hear it when you say it.  I think we finally got a break.  We started early today, by the way,  if you care.  We pushed into the pre-show today.  To get started, so...  We didn't play our little music. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, we didn't do any of that, right?  No.  Oh.  We didn't play the intro.  But there wasn't a palaver warning.  Oh.  Maybe we should do all that for the people.  They love it.  They demand it.  Um, I noticed a lot of apologies while we were gone.  Could someone...  Oh, shit.  Because I lost track.  Lost track.  Maybe Travis or somebody could give us a quick list of all the apologies that happened during the break.  Insane.  It was unbelievable. 
[01:46:00]  We are just...  The Mark Cuban one...  That was hilarious.  That blows my mind.  Hilarious.  Didn't he stick by what he said, though?  Oh, he did.  But then he apologized for no reason to Trayvon's family.  But he wasn't mentioning Trayvon's family.  Nothing.  He didn't apologize to the family of some skinhead.  That was unbelievable to me.  Yeah.  Can we get a list of the apologies, Sam?  Uh, yeah.  Or, you know, even if it's not a perfect list, but there's...  I mean, the Snapchat guy, I remember. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, right, right.  Some guy...  Yeah.  Was that the guy that was apologizing for something he did in, like, high school?  Yeah, college.  College or some shit.  I think it was a baseball team, because they said the wrong thing on Memorial Day,  which was innocent enough, because they said barbecue.  Travis is running down the hall, but we'll do it after the break, Travis.  Yeah.  We'll get the whole list of apologies to us.  No need to run, Trav.  We'll do it after the break.  Okay.  Just so he could, you know...  You got it in front of you.  Oh, you did do it?  Oh.  I didn't check anything yet, because I walked in and just jumped on the air. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, there's like four in front of you.  Oh, okay.  And these are the ones over the break?  Yes.  I felt like there were more than four.  I think there are...  Yeah.  There are more.  I just...  But these are some of the bigger ones, I guess.  That's right.  It's unbelievable.  All right.  So we'll step aside.  We'll continue.  More Opie and Anthony in a minute.  On Sirius XM.

Doug from the O&A Vault, this is a 20th anniversary O&A Radio Gem.  Hey, we've got to introduce intern David to the audience.  Yeah.  Here he is.  How are you guys doing today? 
[01:56:30]  Hey!  Introduce yourself.  These are our fans.  It's good to see everybody come out for the show today.  I'm Dave.  I'm the new intern for Opie and Anthony.  Isn't it like watching an exhibit at the ZJU?  Tell them a little bit about yourself, David.  I'm Dave.  I'm from North Jersey.  I'm studying broadcasting, radio, TV broadcasting, and really excited for this internship. 
[01:57:00]  You looking to be a broadcaster or just run it?  No, no.  No, I'm a broadcaster.  You know how it goes.  I'm looking to be a broadcaster as opposed to running and producing.  I'm looking to be on air eventually.  We're going to show you one of the hottest porns going today.  Just a clip.  And I want you to describe it for the audience, okay?  Whose opinion is it that it's the hottest porn going?  Oh, look at this David.  Hey, he's getting cocky.  He raises a good point, though.  Three hours in, he's getting cocky.  Yeah.  Where am I watching this?  Oh, he's getting demanding and pushy. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  For the audience, I want you to describe what's going on.  This is two girls, one cup, my friend.  Here we go.  Describe it.  That's pretty nice.  Good description.  You're not describing good enough.  This is radio.  You want to do radio?  I can say whatever I want to about it?  Yes.  Yeah.  In graphic detail.  Okay.  Got it.  Curse.  Okay.  Got it.  All right.  Here we go.  Describe it.  Okay.  We have two girls right now.  One girl is standing up.  One girl is sitting.  The girl on the bottom is, uh, the girl on top took her, uh, pulled her shirt down. 
[01:58:00]  The girl on the bottom is kissing her, uh, one of her breasts.  All right.  Pretty good.  All right.  Here we go.  Describe.  And describe it.  No.  Oh, no.  That's no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  All right.  Go.  Go back.  No.  No.  That's no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't know if I'm, I don't know if I'm going to be able to, uh, you have to.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to eat the rest of the day.  What's wrong?  He turned away from the, uh, the TV. 
[01:58:30]  No, no.  That's too much for me.  I thought you meant cup like a breast-sized cup.  I didn't know you meant like that kind of a cup.  Oh, no.  No.  Two girls, one cup.  What a morbid video that would be.  I don't know.  That's just too much for me.  Uh, wait a minute, David.  This is kind of an initiation for the interns.  You have to watch this.  That's not the end of the video?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  No.  Now, now, David, we're going to be watching you.  You have to keep your eyes open and look at the screen.  If you turn away or shut your eyes, we're just going back and it's going to take longer. 
[01:59:00]  We're taking the shirt back and we're kicking you off the, you know.  Okay, okay.  That's right.  You'll be in the doghouse.  That's right.  You'll be in the doghouse.  And you want me to explain what I'm seeing?  Yes.  Yes.  And I can say whatever I want.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay, we got that.  The girl sitting down is shitting into a cup.  And now they're, oh, no.  That's disgusting.  I can't watch that.  No, you have.  That's disgusting, man.  That's disgusting.  I can't watch that.  What's happening?  What's happening, David?  The girl that, both the girls are eating the shit in the cup like an ice cream cone. 
[01:59:30]  They're eating it, both the girls.  They're not eating it.  They're licking it.  They're licking the shit from the ice cream cone.  And now, now the one girl put it in her mouth and she's like playing with it in her mouth  and sticking it on her tongue and moving it around her mouth.  And it seems like she's enjoying it, which is pretty disgusting.  And then, oh, my God, she swallowed it.  Now they're licking it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You got it.  Oh, no.  Now the one girl barfed it back.  She threw it back up. 
[02:00:00]  And they're passing it between their mouths.  Oh, no.  This is too much for me.  They cursed their jersey.  Oh, no.  The one girl jammed her fingers down her mouth to spit the shit back up.  And they're like, this is too much for me.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  David, everybody.  Yeah.  Wow, David.  There you go.  He sounded like Mr. Bill watching that.  Oh, no. 
[02:00:30]  Very good.  No.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, no.  There's shit all over her shirt.  How much is that going to cost to clean?  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  Imagine there's no heaven.  What?  Slip inside the eye of your mind. 
[02:01:00]  Wait a minute.  That's imagine.  Right?  The beginning of that is imagine.  Definitely.  This is Noel Gallagher, right?  Oasis.  Noel is 47 today.  Or is this his brother singing?  I can't figure that shit out.  Which Gallagher sings?  It's Shep Gallagher.  Shep.  All right.  There you go.  Shep Gallagher.  Which is the more angry one?  Oh, boy.  I think they're equally angry at each other. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, they're pretty angry at both of them.  Yeah.  What did you guys do on your break?  Oh, my goodness.  Anything fun?  Yeah, I went to the air show.  All right.  I saw some pics.  That was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Went out on Keith's boat.  No crashes?  No, no, no, no.  They're pretty amazing.  Get a few of those a year now.  Yeah, yeah.  Air shows.  Air show disasters.  Yeah.  This one at Jones Beach, it's not really like other air shows. 
[02:02:00]  Like they have that big one out in Ohio and stuff.  It was just a lot of aerobatic planes.  The propeller ones.  Right.  And then the Blue Angels.  That was like it.  But this year, not a lot of old World War II planes or anything.  So it was cool to see the Blue Angels.  They were pretty righteous.  Yeah, I posted a bunch of pics on Instagram.  Right.  So that was cool.  And then just had people over the house, you know, doing a little party thing. 
[02:02:30]  The weather was nice.  Pool opened for business.  How's your water?  Is it filtered?  It's chlorinated, filtered, and heated.  Okay, good.  It's wonderful.  Right.  Yeah, there's the Blue Angels.  Nice.  The weather wasn't too bad.  Whoa, they were that low?  Yeah.  How low was that?  That's low.  But how low?  I don't know.  That's, you know.  Trees are...  Wait, go back to that picture.  Why are you...  The sky was white?  The sky was fucking just clasping. 
[02:03:00]  Because I saw your pictures and it was weird.  Yeah, I know.  It looks a lot better with a blue sky.  You photoshopped them or something.  Yeah.  On a white background.  I was bummed it wasn't a blue sky.  They were that close?  To what?  Each other.  To each other, yeah.  Those guys get really close.  Wait, these are your pictures?  They look like they're animations or something.  Dude, tell me about it.  Good job.  That's from that big camera?  Yeah.  I had the long lens on.  What's that do?  It puts you up pretty goddamn close. 
[02:03:30]  And you could...  You know...  But how do you do it?  Do you go...  Oh...  No!  Ah!  Fuck!  Go!  Click!  And then you just have blue sky?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no.  It's...  It is kind of cool.  It's a cool little challenge.  Did you take a bunch of pictures in a row like that?  Yeah, I would follow the planes as they were going.  And just...  Right.  You just take a shitload of fucking pictures.  And then you learn shit.  You know, you need a crazy fast shutter speed.  Because you'll just get a blur. 
[02:04:00]  Right.  If you don't.  And then if you have that, the picture's going to be dark.  So you've got to increase the ISO.  You've got to open up the fucking aperture.  It's like taking a photography class.  Oh, is that what aperture means?  Aperture.  I don't know what aperture means.  What are you, Ansel Adams now?  I know.  I'm Ansel Adams.  Actually, I got some really good pictures.  But believe me, it's the fucking camera.  It's all about the camera.  Nothing to do with me.  Why is that plane annoying?  You have great pictures of people on a boat and that stupid plane is annoying.  It's just annoying them. 
[02:04:30]  Is that guy trying to wave to a blue angel?  I think he's taking a picture with his iPhone.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Because that'll work.  See, the other picture, Sam, could you go to the other one where he's very close to the ground?  That's up in the air.  That's up in the air.  That's up in the air.  That one.  See, that's kind of a funny picture.  Because look at the speed limit sign, Opie.  Oh, it says 35 miles an hour.  He's got to be speed.  I sure hope they gave him a ticket.  Yes, I did.  How's it going?  Did anybody respond to it?  Yes.  He'll probably get a ticket. 
[02:05:00]  Chip responded.  Yes, I saw.  Oh, that's right.  Chip did respond.  I was like, thank you, Chip.  Aren't people wonderful?  They are wonderful.  God, I love you.  Yeah.  Let's see.  If the trees are, let's say, 20 feet high, maybe.  Not even.  Those, yeah.  Yeah, they look lower to the ground.  20.  That's less than.  That's like less than 60 feet.  Not even.  Yeah.  About 60 feet, maybe?  50 feet?  Somewhere between 50 and 75 feet up at that point. 
[02:05:30]  What's he on over right there?  Is he over water?  He's just over the beach.  There's a beach just past that road.  Right.  And it's really cool.  They got those guys flying right at each other.  And then at the last minute, they pull that little move where they turn away from each  other real quick.  It's pretty cool.  It's pretty goddamn cool.  And then there's another little thing they do where four of them will be flying in formation  in front of you.  So you're like, oh, there they are.  And you're looking.  And the other two are coming from behind you now to fuck with you. 
[02:06:00]  You don't see them or hear them or anything until they go right over your head.  That's how fast you'd be bombed.  You'd just fucking be dead.  How are they not?  I know.  They're just inches apart.  That has to be some kind of a height thing, too, right?  There's like four of them clustered together there.  Yeah.  How do they figure that out?  And nowadays, it's probably a little easier, I'm assuming, with GPS and all that.  Right.  But there was a time they really just really did it with pretty much eyesight. 
[02:06:30]  I think they're flying by hand right there.  You do?  I honestly don't think they would trust.  One guy fucks up and everyone's dead.  Yeah.  It's happened, too.  It's happened before.  Rare, though.  Very rare with those guys, especially.  Yeah, they're pretty good.  They know what they're doing, these fuckers.  Good hand-eye coordination.  What is it?  Like, everyone's, okay, ready?  And we're going to turn now!  Yeah.  And go, go in!  Oh, my God!  Imagine that.  That would fuck it up.  I would love to talk to one of those guys, because I don't care how long they've been doing it. 
[02:07:00]  It has to...  Something in their minds are like, fuck.  Yeah.  Is Charlie hung over today?  Is this going to be all right?  Yeah.  Is he out chasing some skirt last night?  Turn now!  Oh, could you imagine?  Yeah.  They're inches off each other's wings.  Yeah.  Right?  At times?  Yeah.  It's very impressive to watch.  Always reminds me of the Sammy Hagar Van Halen Dreams video. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  Whenever you see the Blue Angels.  Right.  But that was a lot of fun.  And then, of course...  How was the traffic?  Oh, you were on a boat.  On a boat.  Boat traffic.  Nothing.  Right.  Keith's got a new boat.  It's pretty goddamn cool.  A little 40-footer.  He's getting crazy with the fucking size of boats.  No one could just keep the boat they have.  Like, you get a boat, and then it's like, nah, I gotta get a bigger boat.  What do you get with a 40-foot?  A little cabin action? 
[02:08:00]  Downstairs?  What do we got?  Nice big two bathrooms.  Main bedroom.  Really?  You know?  The master suite.  Then side bedrooms.  Side bedrooms?  Yeah, yeah.  And then the galley.  You get, like, an oven and the fucking sink area.  Wait, he's got a master suite in the front?  Yeah.  And then...  And then there's, on the port side, there's a couple of beds in another whole separate  room with a separate bathroom in there. 
[02:08:30]  So it's pretty impressive.  Did you guys sleep on the boat?  No.  I went out and came back.  What time did you go out?  Went out early, like 8 a.m.  Oh, boy.  He invited me, but for some reason I thought it was 4th of July.  No.  I was thinking 4th of July.  It was the memorial thing.  I just forgot.  Memorial thing.  I like sleeping on the boat.  Wow.  Who's walking around topless?  What was that?  That was Bruce Willis' daughter.  What?  Scout.  She's quite a delightful body.  What?  Really?  Yeah.  If you can get over that chin, she's all right. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, she definitely has a Bruce Willis chin.  I haven't read the papers yet.  It says, a fit of peaks.  Bruce and Demi's kid bears ire at Instagram.  Why is she just...  Bruce Willis' daughter, Scout, is a real diehard about her right to post topless photos  on Instagram.  What the fuck?  The perky Hollywood princess took a bare-breasted jaunt around the Lower East Side this week  to protest the social media websites banning of nudity.  Instagram doesn't allow nudity. 
[02:09:30]  But I can see they don't allow in cock or pussy shots, but you can't show breasts.  The 22-year-old, this is her cause.  Right?  She wants to be able to show her tits on Instagram.  That's a great cause, though.  I back her up 100%.  True.  True.  Where are the pictures?  Show some pictures of her tits.  Oh, there she goes.  So she just walks down the street like this?  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Make that bigger.  You know what?  Why don't you use the technology that Mars installed?  I can't see.  Sam, put it up there.  Put it up on that screen up there. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, Sam.  Right there, Sam.  And go.  Let's see.  Wait.  The audience will wait.  Do you know how it's done?  I do not.  You've got to do it.  He goes, I do not.  Listen to the beginning of the show, and this will all make sense.  Oh, look.  He's turning dials.  He's turning analog dials.  What the fuck?  Pushing buttons.  He's pushing buttons.  What are you doing?  Now he's looking around the room to see if it took.  Get up and walk across the room and change the station.  That's how it does.  Mars said you've got to get up now and do that part of it. 
[02:10:30]  All right.  But I don't know if you can do that part if you're still over there.  I have no idea.  I think you need someone to still turn the buttons over there as you go over here.  What needs to be done?  Go get Mars.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  I want this on the clock.  Oh, my God.  This is where we're at.  New technology, I guess, where whatever's on the computer screen, we can put on a TV here in the studio.  Yeah.  So I want to see how this is going to work.  We want Demi and Bruce's daughter's tits on the TV. 
[02:11:00]  Hold on, Mars.  All right.  Put the photo up.  All right.  We want that on a TV, Mars.  And go!  What the fuck?  Not that.  Go!  Five seconds.  Not that.  No, that.  On Jimmy's TV over here.  Ten seconds.  Fifteen seconds.  Oh, he's got the remote in his hand.  He's got the remote.  Oh, the two of them switch.  All right.  There we go.  There it is.  Twenty seconds.  Now make it bigger. 
[02:11:30]  Make it bigger on that screen.  I can't see.  It's too tiny, Mars.  I need it bigger.  Let's go to the computer.  It's on both TVs now.  How about it's only on one?  I don't want to just look at it.  Tits, tits.  I got it.  Nice picture.  Do glasses come with this?  It's all blurry.  Two glasses.  I couldn't think of some reason why we'd look at something blurry.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, what is this?  An eye test?  Hi.  Her boobs are mushy or something.  Do you think they're mushy?  No, those are young fucking hanging teardrops. 
[02:12:00]  No, but it's like...  The nipples are a little high.  Something.  A little high.  A little high in the breath.  They're misshapen a little bit.  They're a little oval.  I'm looking at them on it because it's right here.  Their nips are a little oval.  This is her cause, really?  She's just walking down the street.  What city is that?  New York.  Lower East Side.  It's New York.  Let me take a better look.  A 22-year-old whose mom is striptease star Demi is boycotting the site and has posted  racy shots of her stroll on Twitter with the hashtag, free the nipple. 
[02:12:30]  One shot features Scout checking out flowers with the caption, legal in New York City, but  not on Instagram.  Another shows her on Orchard Street in just a summary skirt with the words, what Instagram  won't let you see.  Oh, what Instagram won't let you see.  Going topless is, in fact, perfectly legal in New York City.  But you usually see horrible ones.  You see them every once in a while, especially if you're in, like, Sheep Meadow.  Does it?  In Central Park.  Yeah.  But it's always the horrible ones that are showing. 
[02:13:00]  Don't they still...  They don't arrest anybody in New York City?  They can.  It's legal.  It's totally legal.  It's completely legal now.  Can you imagine the looks you'd get in Times Square?  There's children!  Isn't there something they could get you on, like, though, for fucking disturbing the peace?  You're not, though.  If you got big ones.  Inciting a riot.  For some reason, if you got big ones, they're more sexual.  Big ones are fucking sexual.  Flat chest and the cops go, ah, oh, you daffy bastard.  Yeah, and if you start, like, tweaking your nipples and massaging your tits, doesn't that 
[02:13:30]  become something else?  Maybe.  I don't know.  We'd have to ask a cop.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I would like to know that.  I would.  Her beef started on May 20th when Instagram deleted her photo of a Babe Bomber sweatshirt,  whatever that is.  Welcome to the party, pal.  Emblazoned with an image of two topless women.  Oh, okay.  She had a sweatshirt with two topless women on it.  Emblazoned.  I got it.  Yeah, okay.  So, why does Instagram allow photos of heroin being used but deletes a photo of a print  of some attractive woman without her top on? 
[02:14:00]  She tweeted.  I like the fact she doesn't care about the ugly ones getting deleted.  Yeah.  She's glad this girl.  Scout is good.  I don't like her name, though.  On May 22nd, she declared her boycott, firing off photos and tweets, decrying the company  as hypocritical.  It's a girl cut.  Good one.  One of the many saucy images she tweeted featured a woman in a barely there swimsuit with the  caption, Instagram pictures of breast cancer survivors have been flagged, deleted, but  this is super sick and hot. 
[02:14:30]  Am I right?  I don't know.  Fuck.  I want to see what she looks like completely naked.  Yeah.  Like, I bet she looks like she's got good hips.  Yeah, I wish she would protest vag pictures.  Yes.  Protest the vagina pictures.  Or anal bleaching photos.  Anal bleaching.  Ah, shit.  My comfort with my body should not be dictated by how others perceive me.  Yeah.  On Wednesday, Instagram defended its no-bare breast policy to the post, saying, 
[02:15:00]  we try hard to find a good balance between allowing people to express themselves creatively  and keeping Instagram a fun and safe place.  What's more fun than a nice pair of breasts?  A pisser.  Tits are a hoot.  They scream fun.  Oh, wow.  Let's see that.  Her chin is just...  Some guy wrote, topless in New York is legal as long as it's not for profit.  What does Christ have to do with this? 
[02:15:30]  I guess that's why Sandy Kane has to wear pasties.  Oh.  Because she's making money.  What if you're filming somebody for no profit?  For no profit?  I don't know.  I don't know how that works.  Look, she's just buying some flowers.  Her fucking tits hanging right out.  Yeah.  Nice.  That is nice.  The side view is very nice.  Oh, oh, I should have looked up there.  Thank you, Sam.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  We're looking at the...  The contrast is all off on those screens.  It looks terrible.  I know.  It looks terrible.  That's hotter.  It's E-rocking a panda monster.  Oh, panda noise.  Terrible.  So that was it for your break?  Yeah.  I just pretty much stayed at home and had some people over.  Kind of a thing.  Finished watching Boardwalk Empire. 
[02:16:30]  Are you caught up?  Finally, so I could explain to people that I finished watching so they can't spoil it for me now.  Uh-huh.  How amazing was the season finale of last year?  Dote.  Wasn't that great?  That fight.  That was so good.  Oh, what a great fight.  With the brother and the fed.  Oh, fuck yeah.  God.  Oh.  Pulls off the...  Yes.  It's fucking great.  Poof.  Oh, yeah.  That's...  Oh.  Final one.  A little sad, right?  Yeah.  Did you cry? 
[02:17:00]  No, but it was sad.  It was well done.  Very.  It was a great ending to a Boardwalk Empire.  It was.  It was good.  That show's fucking great, man.  Good acting.  Yeah.  Good acting in that one.  Yeah, so I pretty much did that and played some, what they call video games.  It was pretty lackluster.  Sometimes those are the best, right?  Yeah.  Just chilling out.  Popped a few bottles.  You know.  A few bottles?  Put my bottle on. 
[02:17:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  All right.  And our mayor is trying to bring back ferrets.  Of all the things he could be doing as the mayor of New York City, he's bringing back  the ferret.  Why, uh...  Ferrets have been banned in New York City since, I think, 90...  Why are they banned?  Yeah, what was the reason?  Do they suck?  Yeah.  Do they smell?  Do they look like dicks with fucking legs?  They are stinky little things.  Terrible monsters.  I had a friend with a ferret. 
[02:18:00]  They stink.  They stink.  There's nothing you can do with them.  They look like Frank Burns.  A ferret face.  I don't want ferrets harmed or anything, but they're a shitty pet.  They do smell.  So why is he taking up this cause?  They have that very wild, musky smell.  But why is he taking it up?  Uh...  Oh, yeah.  No filter Paul was over at my house.  No filter Paul and his wife.  I haven't seen...  I have not...  I can't...  I'm fucking too far away. 
[02:18:30]  Over there.  This new technology is horrendous.  It's awful.  It really is terrible.  Can't even tell who's in these pictures.  They all look like the same person.  I know.  It's all the contrast.  It's terrible.  Oh, boy.  Man, but just a bunch of fat drunks.  Oh, my God.  I have not seen no filter Paul in a...  Oh, look how big Beavis is.  A little Beavis head.  Beavis is a delight.  Oh, he is. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  Enough slideshow.  Who cares?  This is your family vacation.  That's pretty...  What is that?  It's a lawn jockey.  Ha!  Lawn jockey at my house.  I have another one, too.  What are you going to do?  There they are.  Wow.  I haven't seen him and Denise in quite a while.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I did.  There it is.  You could...  Yeah.  Look up at the screen.  It was... 
[02:19:30]  Contrast turned up full.  Mmm.  Terrible.  Yeah, so why does he want to bring them back, and why were they banned?  Was there a rabies thing?  Were they afraid of the rabies?  These are the things you can't have as pets in New York City.  Oh.  Pot-bellied pigs.  Yeah.  Iguanas.  No iguanas?  Hedgehogs.  Hedgehogs?  Who wants that?  I do.  Squirrels.  Bernie Getz had a squirrel.  Wasn't that one of his...  Mm-hmm.  Wasn't that one of his causes?  Obsessions.  Yes, obsessions.  Yeah, right.  He wanted a squirrel, and there's a law, so he was... 
[02:20:00]  He had a problem with that, so he shot his squirrel five times.  Bats.  No.  Elephants.  If you keep them in your belfry.  You can't have an elephant.  That's in his belfry.  I understood.  Yep.  Unfortunately.  Yes.  What else?  Elephants.  Elephants.  Aardvarks.  We're in violation.  He's shaking his head. 
[02:20:30]  His trunk is moving.  Call the health department, please.  Immediately.  There's a violation going on.  All-fanged venomous snakes.  Can't have a New York.  Yes.  Including those vipers, cobras, mambas, and coral snakes.  What are the other snakes we got?  Anacandes.  Radler.  Burmese pythons.  Bull constrictor.  Mm-hmm.  Coral snake.  Can't have eagles, hawks, and falcons.  Water moccasins.  They bite pretty good. 
[02:21:00]  They bite pretty good.  Eagles, hawks, and falcons.  Eagles.  And then you got those marsupials they don't want to have.  Ah, you can't have any kind of...  Like the Tasmanian devils, the kangaroos, the koalas, and the opossums.  Nothing with the...  Opossum.  I actually said opossums.  Opossum.  They really got to get rid of that fucking...  That stupid O.  They got to get rid of the O.  It's...  Opossum.  Opossums.  And you can't have whales.  You're not allowed to have a whale again. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, two tickets.  Maybe they'll show leniency.  Are you saying that we're going to be ticketed twice with the same mammal?  Isn't it nice to be back from vacation?  Oh, ee.  Oh, did you mean New York?  No, I...  We were keeping it vague.  We were keeping it vague.  Ah, stuff the ferrets, Mr. Mayor, and save the horses. 
[02:22:00]  Fuck those horses.  I can't stand it.  That's the loud and clear message from the city's horse carriage drivers who couldn't understand Wednesday  how de Blasio could consider lifting the city's ban on ferrets while still vowing to run the iconic steeds out of Manhattan.  Maybe because ferrets aren't being fucking kept where traffic is going and tying up traffic  and people aren't...  They're not dragging people around a park, shitting all over the streets.  Fucking idiots.  That fucking area over there by the plaza... 
[02:22:30]  Terrible.  The smell coming off of there is fucking awful.  There's great rat watching over there.  Yeah.  Oh, it is there.  If you come to New York, the plaza, there's a park in front of the plaza, but across the street,  it would be, I guess, what would that be?  North, right?  Yeah, north.  North.  There's another small park where the horses are parked in front with the seed all over the road,  and that brings the rats.  The rats.  You've got to wait until a little later in the day when the sun starts going down, 
[02:23:00]  and man, do they come running all over that place.  Yeah.  So what's happening with that ban?  I guess it's tied up in court, but I cannot wait for there to be no more horses.  Well, this guy had one of the best quotes ever.  He says, maybe we should get the ferrets to pull the tourists around in carriages,  said a fuming Ian McKeever, spokesman for the Horse and Carriage Association.  Ian, how many ferrets would it take to pull one fat fucking tourist? 
[02:23:30]  Exactly.  It's a shit life for a horse.  Standing at the park with his dumb leg being lifted.  They're miserable.  People stand there tied to a lamppost.  Some fucking pig gets on.  I wouldn't see the park.  Then walk, slob.  That was me being the horse.  Take a walk through the park, you fucking monster.  I don't know.  It keeps going on and on, but I don't even know why he gives a fuck about ferrets.  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  Out of everything a mayor has to do, this is one of his things.  All the issues.  He actually has to sit down and discuss.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Anyway, there's more to the story about who cares.  They're trying to bring ferrets back.  Yeah.  So.  I didn't read the papers earlier, so I'm reading them now.  Oh.  I just perused.  I jumped right on the air, so. 
[02:24:30]  I always read the stories the night before.  Peruse them.  My stories.  I like to read my stories.  Your stories.  Just get a little bit of knowledge for the radio.  I still don't know why ferrets were banned, though.  I wonder why.  Oh, you.  Maybe they bit people with, they have a high bite against eggs, you know what I mean?  Maybe.  Let me see.  It should be in the Oracle, right?  You can keep pet rats, or maybe they procreate too much.  They sure do take their liberties with the city laws.  Like, the city, they're able to go, ah, you can't do that. 
[02:25:00]  Well, the state says you can.  Yeah, but we say no.  I don't know.  Fucking New York.  You know that ferrets will bond with their owners, and they'll wag their tails, and even  giggle when they're happy?  Giggle.  That's, uh, gotta be a lie.  And it's not, do you ever hear a ferret giggle?  No.  It's weird sounding.  Do you, do you have an example?  I do, actually.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[02:25:30]  That's not it.  I got your answer.  You do?  It's kind of, it's.  Sorry, giggle.  It's slightly interesting.  Ah!  I'm not going to oversell this, but it's slightly interesting.  Ferrets are illegal in the vast majority of the United States, including the rest of New  York State, but they were banned under the Giuliani administration 15 years ago due to  the since-remedied lack of a rabies vaccine.  Lack of a rabies vaccine? 
[02:26:00]  So if you got the rabies from the ferret, they had nothing to help you with that.  There's no vaccine to prevent it.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I bet it was a rabies vaccine for the ferret himself.  Like, you give a cat.  Oh, I misread that, too.  No.  That's how it reads to me.  Because there's no such thing as a vaccine for rabies.  Right.  There's a treatment after you're bitten, which is a cure, but a vaccine would prevent you  from getting rabies, but there isn't that for humans.  But you can give, like, you give your dog and cat a rabies shot. 
[02:26:30]  They didn't have one for a ferret.  Because they just, all right, gotcha.  Now they do.  So if you have a ferret, you get the rabies shots.  Give it to your ferret.  Right.  Sorry.  Damn.  And misconceptions about viciousness.  Well, they look like they're supposed to be way more vicious than they are.  But they are.  Their face is kind of cute.  Not those pink-eyed ones.  They look just like big, giant rats.  Look at the claws on the fucking thing.  The ones that look like, uh, that wear a little burglar mask. 
[02:27:00]  They're adorable.  But then they stink, so fuck it.  If cats and pit bulls are legal, how could a ferret be illegal?  It's absurd.  Said Robert Shapiro, director of the Social Tease Animal Rescue on the Lower East Side.  Look, see?  Little ferret.  What's he doing?  He's angry.  He's mad?  Is he making sounds?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What, you don't know how to get volume on this anymore?  Do I still have to do it over here? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, look at the little guy.  Look there.  That's a big fucking ferret.  Look over there.  No, I don't want to watch a ferret 30 feet away.  What's he doing?  He's not making any sound.  Stupid mute thing.  He's bigger than I thought they were.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa, is it hissing?  No, that was the sliding glass door thing.  I didn't know.  I think.  I thought he was hissing. 
[02:28:00]  I don't even know, but it sounded like a sliding glass door.  He looks like a slinky.  He's kind of cute.  Yeah.  Look at the guy's got booze bottles in this house.  I know, there's like this empty Coors thing.  What a drunk this guy is.  He probably thinks to the cats.  Oh, look.  It's crawling into a box.  Sure.  They stink, though.  Anyway.  So, now you've got these people saying, hopefully hedgehogs will be next, said Tricia.  What?  A hedgehog advocate and breeder from Suffolk County. 
[02:28:30]  Ew.  Who's a hedgehog advocate?  A hedgehog advocate.  I advocate for hedgehogs.  Yes.  A hedgehog advocate.  Hedgehog lawyer.  That's stupid.  Sterling's going to sue the NBA?  Oh, yeah?  Oh, he ain't fucking around now.  But didn't he say he was going to sell the team?  He said, fuck that.  He's fighting right to the end now.  Donald Sterling authorized his wife to sell his beloved Clippers, then suddenly changed 
[02:29:00]  his mind and blasted the NBA for trying to strip him of the team over his hate-filled  rant.  Hate-filled.  In his own private conversation.  Yeah.  Cool.  Well, let's get all...  You know what?  I agree with the NBA on this.  Let's just get anyone with a felony conviction out of the NBA.  Anyone.  Doesn't that seem a little more dangerous and hurtful than somebody being taped saying things?  Isn't it overselling it by saying hateful, by the way? 
[02:29:30]  It is really overselling it.  That was his thoughts on the situation at hand with his chick there.  Not the nicest things to say, certainly.  He didn't say, I don't want...  I don't like blacks.  I don't like black people being at my games.  He said, I don't like when you...  It's probably a conversation...  Take black guys to the game.  Right.  Hate-filled.  They make it sound like...  That's the world we live in now.  Right. 
[02:30:00]  A lot of apologies this past week, right?  Yeah, we'll do it after the break.  We should.  Why don't we do that?  I like getting angered by people apologizing for nothing.  I've got to find out about Rory McIlroy.  What?  Do you even know who Rory McIlroy is?  Is he the golfer?  Yes, he is.  Was he engaged?  He broke up with his chick, but it's a weird one.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we'll tell you about it.  We'll tell you about it next.  He put a note on his foot and kicked her in the vagina.

[02:53:00]  sing at the top of our lungs rain on me yeah some asshole had to tell you you know it's rain or  he had to say over right but he couldn't put two syllables in there so he figured he'd just  contract the word to or rain or me can we hear rain or me  first day back we got add rock just fucking play right i'm trying to find who does that song the  exactly stupid fuck you just said who does that song you answered your own question

[02:59:00]  figured it out see it was very difficult to put over in this song so we had to get rid of the v  right next thing you know you got a hit i had to look and see if it was even a word  right i wasn't sure and it lo and behold it's it's our oh  rain oh  it's the dumbest thing it really is me fucking chuckle so stupid i read about uh keith moon just 
[02:59:30]  yesterday he was part of this list of uh celebrities that have killed people  wow yes where's this list it's probably up online somewhere celebrities that have killed  people you'd be very surprised uh apparently i got one keith moon yeah oh go ahead sorry  keith moon back in uh what they called the day right um he was leaving a pub a pub and uh he he he 
[03:00:00]  was being um kind of harassed by some people so he jumped into his car to drive away right  and he hit one of his bodyguards and killed him whoa it haunted him till the day he died too  are these people that killed somebody that are able to walk around or are people that are have  killed and are no longer walking around because they went to jail for no these are people that um  are free matthew broderick that was going to be mine matthew broderick matthew broderick was  going to be mine i didn't know did oj kill someone uh supposedly wow and then he was there's no 
[03:00:30]  description either like everyone else it's like matthew broderick was with his girlfriend in ireland  jennifer gray and they uh were driving in the wrong way on a street i think it was ireland right  oj it says obviously oh it does okay you know no no explanation matthew broderick is the dumbest  one on that whole list he just got confused and was driving on the wrong side of the road because  he was in ireland uh-huh it was like what this can't possibly be right i'm going to the other side 
[03:01:00]  of the road that left turn over there when you're got when you got to drive on the other side of the  street i the left and right turn it's got to be crazy i did it once in uh where were we i think it  was turks and caicos yeah well which one uh it is uh it's tough to get used to yeah huh your whole  your whole brain is saying go over there yep man i didn't know laura bush killed somebody oh yeah  yeah she did yeah yeah not as many as her husband though more oil more for oil age 17 yeah 17 she i 
[03:01:30]  think that was like a driving thing too right yeah she crashed into another car uh after she ran a stop  sign whoops well they're all drunk she killed a classmate of hers right oh that's not very nice  no william s burroughs killed somebody who did william s burroughs kill uh killed his common law  wife fucking bitch initially he claimed the two were playing a drunken game of william tell and 
[03:02:00]  that he was attempting to shoot a glass off of her head and missed fuck right in the face huh he later  uh changed his story to a simpler mishandling a firearm oh there you go hold on hold on before because  we're we have i think we have four topics topics going at the same time four things we're talking about  we're juggling rich and uh you always get your adam sandler uh defenders rich rich in uh charlotte  says every sandler movie in 10 years has cleared 100 million but that doesn't mean it's a good movie 
[03:02:30]  we had that argument with uh that guy that came in we made oh uh the the short guy paul williams no  the short guy that rich boss who likes us too and we like him but we said uh up a creek with a paddle  or without the power oh that fucker and we kind of try to make fun with seth seth green we kind of  made fun of the fact that he was in that shitty movie because we were kind of feeling it with him  and we were getting along and he's like i'll i'll have you know it made a hundred million dollars 
[03:03:00]  or something like that i'm like that doesn't mean it's a good movie then meanwhile on that  the masses are asses on that dumb show family guy thank you they actually goofed on that the fact  they brought up that movie to the sun because seth green does the the voice right and they brought  up without a paddle and he just did his like hey what are you talking about he just did you know  but in here he was actually he was actually a little a little pissed off and i'm like  so uh to rich and charlotte on his shoulder and others it doesn't mean it was it was a good movie 
[03:03:30]  does not that reminds me of the time you guys can make believe those grown-up movies are good i'm  not fucking gonna sit here make believe that shit is good they're horrible movies without a paddle made  uh domestic total um 50 uh wasn't even 100 million million all right yeah all right but he got mad at  that i'm like wow and then other people are saying or is a word we know oh my god is this oh can you 
[03:04:00]  can someone find my uh wireless mouse i want to answer a phone call did you throw it oh there it is  where oh there it is does it still work where's the goddamn beacon so we finally have to use this  to answer a phone call uh all right and then we got this guy chris in virginia chris oh yeah yeah  i i from the way you guys are talking it sounds like uh you think they made up that uh or uh  contraction i guess it is no we we we understand it's in a lot of classic literature trust me we know 
[03:04:30]  it's a word but my bad my point with the whole thing is that we all we all we all we all sang that  song at rain on me yeah at first we all thought it was rain on me yeah and then you look at the  lyrics one day and you go oh fuck it's not on it's or so wait they want to say rain over me yeah and  then it's a it's just one of our dumb stupid who gives a fuck bits yeah oh that's fine it really is 
[03:05:00]  a who gives a fuck okay i do know war is a word it's in the national anthem wait how wait how does  it go in the national or the land of the free and oh yeah or the land of the free right yeah yeah  that was 1814 so it's been around couldn't they just have it as war or and that's all  of course right thank you oh so the flag is flying or the land of the free and the home of the brave 
[03:05:30]  that's a revelation i think so too i didn't really know that it was or the land of the free because  that makes sense too i thought it was four oh you thought it was for the land of the land of the free  and the home holy shit we don't even know the fuck oh when i go through customs i always get  nervous that they go prove you're from america and sing the national anthem i practice on the plane  just do it that way i do the instrumental version 
[03:06:00]  some asshole many years ago when i started flying internationally i forgot who it was but they  scared me with that it's like you know when you go to customs they they want you to prove you're  from america and sometimes they they want you to do the pledge of allegiance or sing the national  anthem so to this day i actually practice who the fuck like that's like something they do in old war  movies all right jerry i'm not even lying if you're an american who won the 1932 world series 
[03:06:30]  and then you realize you go through customs and that it's that it's just their shitty job  yeah everyone has their shitty job and that's theirs they just don't they just want to move  people through they don't give a fuck if you're actually even from the country  right they're just doing their dumb job yeah let's say hi to uh trucker dan don't worry uh  so we're gonna get to you and we're gonna get back to the the celebrity list as well uh trucker dan go  ahead all right guys proud to be a part of add radio this morning all right 
[03:07:00]  right i uh was going to talk to you about the famous contraction of dire maker by led zeppelin  that's how a lot of people jamaica yeah it's did you make her what is he saying  did you fuck her dire maker is like there's an apostrophe in that too right yeah d-y-apostrophe-e-r  yeah d-y-e-r maker right right cheer because there's a j in there or something i don't even 
[03:07:30]  know or care that that that that that that that that that how do you not like zeppelin  how do you not like zeppelin  oh oh oh oh oh oh oh or are they saying all words or oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah it's pretty good 
[03:08:00]  i think these guys can go far yeah stick to it  i think these guys can go far yeah i'm disappointed by you guys really uh but this  is this is a doozy it's or the ramparts we watched and what what about the or the land of the free 
[03:08:30]  it's for the land of the free and the home of the brave okay so it is for the land of the  or the ramparts we watch or the why don't you know the national anthem why is it over the ramparts  we were oh over the ramparts watch watching it gallantly stream hold on hold on yeah oh it is  it's over the over the ramparts so they're all they're looking over the top of the ramparts 
[03:09:00]  what are the ramparts they're watching the flag wave or right oh that makes more sense  oh  so where's the or part or the or the ramparts or the ramparts we are over the ramparts we watched  but we're not saying over we're saying or or okay gotcha yeah i knew that i don't know  i'm sure you did no i really didn't know that okay good all right i know it like i know it 
[03:09:30]  phonetically i never really thought about it it's like the pledge of allegiance when i was a kid but  all right pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states american to the republic for which it  stands i thought that was one word for which it stands and that's a country i think that's one of  the russian i uh was born and raised in the which is stand yeah i think when they broke up russia that  was one of the names they came up i used to be a brain surgeon in the witches stands 
[03:10:00]  there's also three other paragraphs to the star spangled banner oh yeah but we don't pay attention  to that though yeah they we use the uh we use the the hit radio mix yeah  we don't do the long version the live version  well wow we're learning a lot today we really are which is good or all right so we took care of  those things oh back to the celebrities that kill people why didn't they go uh get or it get or it 
[03:10:30]  get or it fit over get or it  i'm just going to use or now whenever over has to come you know right uh i don't know kdk12 to kdk1 or  i don't know how good it would be sandler's saying he'll never do snl because he 
[03:11:00]  who sandler because he's saying he's slow now or some i don't know how i mean he's slow it would  be i'm slow now there are guys who love doing it who are great at doing it sandler said i just  don't know how good i'd be doing it i did what i can do on the show wow i could sing one of his  stupid songs oh i forgot my song oh i gotta know i actually i actually i actually spent two minutes  on this one oh that's a good one i wrote this in three and a half i almost spent a night writing this

[03:12:00]  like what you row a boat with right right or or or over which is over so who knows anymore  can we go back to the celebrities that killed people yes thank you all right where were we  william s burroughs yeah yeah and then we got don king who i believe killed two people two people  in two separate incidents both of which were not accidental right and this guy walks the earth 
[03:12:30]  what do they say about him again says gambling dead or something i think uh killed two different  men in his younger days as leader of a gambling ring in cleveland ohio he shot one and stomped another  to death wow yeah he shot one guy which he claimed was self-defense the next one is going to get  someone fucking pissed off why robert blake he says he didn't do it he says he didn't do it or is  he now saying he did it uh no wait a minute didn't he he was acquitted wasn't he right 
[03:13:00]  beretta yeah he said something happened and you bring that shit up he gets mad someone came in it  it wasn't me yeah it's like oh i i went in to the restaurant because i forgot my gun right then he  came out oh and she's dead from a gunshot wound you're gonna kill your wife you got plenty of time  to think of a really good yeah good alibi he forgot the doggy bag right what happened it says the last  update here is uh in 2008 an appeals court upheld the civil case verdict civil case but they cut blake's 
[03:13:30]  penalty assessment in him okay so he he won the criminal case and he lost the civil case  like the oj the oj then goes to jail for something stupid all right continue all right who's next  the oj then the matthew broderick who would go to matthew broderick so that was the whole uh he was  driving on the wrong side of the road in ireland or scotland or yeah he wasn't drunk and it says the 
[03:14:00]  reason was never determined with his ferris bueller co-star jennifer gray yes and it says he was  charged with careless driving which came with the 107 dollar fine 170 bucks for a life wow jesus  all right you're free to go you're free to go a little stamp and you're out of here wow they  must have really liked uh his movies over there brandy yeah i think she uh ran into someone on the  la highway there brandy hit the car in front of her by failing to break in time thus killing the 
[03:14:30]  driver in front of her brandy took full responsibility for the accident but was never charged with any  crime oh she took full responsibility that's really nice of her full responsibility is going to jail i  think right yeah that would be full responsibility going you know what i know what the law says but  i'm taking full responsibility and i feel like the law is wrong and i probably should do a little  time for killing somebody right yeah she's probably just speeding and fucking yeah  uh the keith moon what was this one again that that was uh his bodyguard oh right right one of 
[03:15:00]  his bodyguards by accident it says uh yeah he uh ran over a chauffeur and bodyguard outside of a pub  in england while fleeing from skinheads skinheads it says geez he was not charged either  adelaide stevenson i'll lie that's way in the old days who was he up against ike i think it was  ike well yeah i think he ran against ike i don't know it was before our time to relax sal yeah we  just know a little history we actually paid attention in class and presidents they were

[03:43:30]  Sestero  Yeah  Right?  Yep  Nice  What are you, Italian?  Welcome to the show  Italian, yeah  Italian guy  Yeah  Yeah  Well, I was on Red Eye with you like a while ago  Yeah, that's right  Yeah, and that was  I had heard about The Room  And hadn't seen it up to that point  But I had heard about it for years  And then after the appearance on Red Eye  I'm like, I just gotta see this movie  And I watched it probably three or four times now so far  It's just an enigma 
[03:44:00]  It's such an odd thing  There are bad movies all over the place  I mean, there are bad movies that are well produced  Adam Sandler  What?  There are bad movies that are horribly produced  They just look cheap  Adam Sandler  And then there's The Room  And then there's The Room  This thing is like its own animal  Yeah, yeah  Now, why would you think that would take off  And become something bigger than just a bad movie?  Because it's made by somebody who sees the world totally differently 
[03:44:30]  Who has like no connection to like  What, you know, normal people think  And that's, I think, what's original about it  So he's really kind of like the character we saw in the movie  Maybe he is, yeah, that's him  That's literally Tommy is  There's no faking it  There's no joke  So he decided to make a movie  And it was not a goof when he decided to do it, right?  No, he wanted to be a dramatic actor 
[03:45:00]  And he'd been trying to act for a long time before I met him  And so Hollywood really never gave him a shot  Oh, Hollywood  So he's like, you know what?  Forget them, I do myself  I do myself  So he wrote, directed, produced this movie  That he was going to be the next Marlon Brando  It was going to be the next Streetcar Named Desire  And he really believed it  And he went for that  And what's crazy is like despite everything  He still believes it's the greatest film ever made 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, yeah  I've seen some of his discussions  That he holds after the screenings of the film  And he really does have this strange vision of this movie  Yeah, yeah, no, he totally believes in it  And it's like if anybody comes up and they're like  Hey, what do you, you know, why does this movie suck?  He's like, you know what? You suck  How did he get the funding to make the movie?  Was he, uh  I mean, I guess  Yeah, I mean, before I met him  He was, you know, a successful retail man 
[03:46:00]  A retail guy  I guess in real estate  So he had, you know, acquired funds to make his own movie  It just seemed like  Watching him in that movie  That he couldn't function in life  Yeah  Like how does this guy go through life  And actually talk to people  And get things done  You know, he's got this, like, lucky streak  It's like everything he touches, I feel like, works out  You know, like he does retail  And, you know, how hard is it to go out and make a lot of money doing retail? 
[03:46:30]  What kind of retail was he in?  Levi's jeans or something like that?  Levi's jeans  I mean, how do you make that work?  He made that work  And then he's like  I'm going to make a movie  And there's so many movies made, you know, by really talented people that never go anywhere  It's like, oh, I'm going to go make this movie  And he makes this thing, you know  Where you don't even know, you know, really what it is  And it's still showing ten years later around the world  I mean, it just doesn't, I don't know  How do you get involved?  Do you want him for an audition?  Or did you know him personally?  Well, yeah, I knew him before 
[03:47:00]  I took an acting class in San Francisco  When I was, like, 19  My mom thought I was nuts to try to be an actor  So I really didn't have any support system  And he goes up and performs at Shakespearean Sonnet  And the whole class is like, what the hell did I just see?  And I thought it was kind of entertaining  And he's, like, arguing with the teacher that he's, like  He knows what he's talking about and she doesn't  And I'm like, okay, I've got to find out who this guy is  So I approached him to do a scene  And we kind of forged this, like, strange friendship 
[03:47:30]  We both were, like, outsiders in a very different way  And I wanted to move to L.A.  He's like, well, I have an apartment  He just had an apartment in L.A.  Just sitting there  And so he allowed me to go use it  And I was able to get, you know, my foot in the door  I got a couple parts and got started  What did you do before The Room?  Anything we know?  I did a...  Have you ever heard of the Puppet Master series?  It was kind of, like, a weird deal  But anyway, I did...  I got the lead in that  It was, like, my fourth audition  I'd done some soap stuff 
[03:48:00]  You know, I'd just basically gotten started  But to Tommy, it was like I was a movie star  So he's like, if this guy did this, I'm moving to L.A.  So he ended up moving down to L.A.  And living in that same apartment  So we ended up being roommates  In this, like, small one-bedroom apartment  Was the actual living as a roommate with him  A lot like what we see in the movie?  Yeah, it was very much like The Odd Couple  You know, he would spend most of the day sleeping  Getting those creative juices flowing 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I would come back and he would be, like  There was a pull-up bar in the door jam  And he would be hanging in it, like, from a bat  Basically, and I'd be like, oh my god  How am I going to survive this?  It was freaking crazy  I mean, I don't know how I did it  So he decides he's going to make this movie  And how long, do you know how long it took him to write it?  Yeah, when we were roommates  Is when he started writing it  We went out and we saw  The talented Mr. Ripley  Right  And, you know, he felt within him 
[03:49:00]  That he had this dramatic film that he wanted to make  And so we came home that night  And he's like, you know what?  I would write my own movie  Hollywood would be shocked  And so he started writing  He started writing it from that point on  And he had disappeared for a while  I didn't talk to him for like nine months  And he came back with the script completed  And ready to go  I read it and I thought  This is just the most incredible thing I've ever read  I couldn't put it down 
[03:49:30]  It was basically every character in the movie  Kind of talked like him  And so I said  If this thing ever gets made  It's going to be  It's going to either horrify people  Or bring them to applause  So I kind of did both  But he was really relentless  He was going to make this film  He wasn't going to let it die  You know, he put up a billboard for like five years  Five years?  Yeah, it was  This billboard up on Highland was up for five years  You know, it's kind of like Tom Cruise 
[03:50:00]  Still promoting like Vanilla Sky  You know what I mean?  And he said  We're not going anywhere  This movie's going to succeed  And, you know, he'd show up every month  And do like Q&As and midnight screenings  And, you know, it worked  He was dedicated to the project  Did he have any filmmaking experience  As far as the technical aspect goes?  Cameras?  Did he have a director of photography on there?  Yeah, he did  I mean, he bought all his own equipment  He bought his own cameras 
[03:50:30]  Which is incredible  Yeah, usually you would rent them  If you're making a motion picture  Yeah, he was very much, you know  Wanting to kind of have his own studio  But, yeah, he hired a crew  And he just kind of like took over  And wanted every shot to be a certain way  So everybody just kind of got out of his way  Right, he was very involved with every aspect of it  No real B crew  Assistant director kind of  Yeah, he was there for every shot 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, yeah, definitely  It's great  And it shows  Oh, yes, it certainly does  So now you  He says, I would like you to play Mark  Yeah, he wrote the role of Mark for me initially  So when he had disappeared and he'd come back  You know, he showed me the script  And again, I thought it was, you know  It was incredible  But I said, okay  I'm not going to be in it  But I was like, but I'll help you make it  Because I knew making this film for him  Was really important  And, you know, I figured  You know, I knew him better than anybody  So I figured I'd help his support 
[03:51:30]  And help him make it  So we go through this whole casting  We get the casting done  He casts him Mark  And the whole time he's like  Come on, you should play Mark  I was like, no, I shouldn't  So the night before filming  With somebody already cast  We're like, you know  Went to this restaurant  He wanted to kind of celebrate  The night before filming  And he's like, you have to play Mark  I was like, oh, here we go again  And anyway, I was like a 24-year-old guy  You know, struggling, working retail  He made me an offer, basically  I couldn't really refuse 
[03:52:00]  I mean, I thought nobody was going to see this movie  So I was like, okay  I'm going to be on set anyway  You know, why not do it?  It's going to sit on a shelf  It'll never get seen  It'll allow me to kind of stick around  Maybe quit my retail job  And keep treating us  What was the offer, though?  Did you tell people?  I haven't  I mean, it was basically a chance for me to be  You know, okay for a few years  So I could continue  A few years?  Or, you know, a few months  However you spend it, right? 
[03:52:30]  Right  So I figured, you know  I asked my girlfriend at the time  And she's like  Do it, why not?  And she was so against it  I mean, she thought Tommy was  Was out there  Did he creep her out?  Yeah, it's like that night  When he drops me off  He'll just sit there  And like, you know  Stay on the horn  And be like  Beep  We're like talking outside my apartment  Why would he do that?  So  But she's like  Do it  If you're going to be on set anyway  Just do the movie  And I didn't think anybody would see it  But the problem was 
[03:53:00]  Is that somebody else  Already had the role  Right, right  So we had to show up the first day  And I was known as the behind the scenes guy  Like, hey, Greg's just helping out  They didn't know, you know  Nobody knew I knew Tommy before  So we had to find a way to like  Work me in  And he's like  Well, why don't we have  Like, we'll say that the producers  Are like having you audition  For a future project  So we like show up  And I'll start doing scenes  As this part  So the guy's like  Watching me do his part  Wow  And then like  A few hours later 
[03:53:30]  He's like  Oh, I think  Have Greg keep shooting  So then the guy's just sitting there  Watching me play his part  Like the whole day  It was really  That is bizarre  Why not just fire him  Or, you know  Sorry  It's not working out  That's kind of what I thought  I didn't  You know  Tommy normally  Trick him into sitting there  While you do his role  That's  That's creepy  Yeah  It was really weird  And Tommy normally like  Thrives, you know  With confrontation  But for some reason  That was the scheme 
[03:54:00]  So  Yeah  Did you watch any dailies with him?  Oh man  The dailies are priceless  Yeah  And watching those outtakes  Are even better than the film  Was he very excited?  Did he show a scene like that  You're tearing me apart, Lisa  Yeah  And did he was like that?  Oh, he was so proud of that moment  Like that was, you know  That was like Stella  Yeah, that was his Brando  James Dean moment  Jesus Christ 
[03:54:30]  He can't  I can't fathom a person like that  Yeah  He's unlike anybody I've ever met  When did you realize that  It was a bad movie  Like when you were filming?  Well, I knew what it was  Before we filmed it  You knew before  I read that script  And I  What's great is Tommy  And I noticed this in the acting class  When I first met him  Is he's very  He's really entertaining  In his own way  Like there's never a dull moment  Hanging around with Tommy  So at that age 
[03:55:00]  It's kind of fun  You know  Just to hang around with him  But making the movie  I knew what it was going to be  So it was kind of  You know  It was oddly fun  To show up on set  And watch these scenes get made  Right  Because you didn't know  What was going to happen  You know  Just some of these scenes  Would take days to film  And it was just  It was the perfect comedy  Watching it  Yeah  Did you have any suggestions  Like hey  When you know  The mother announces  That she has breast cancer  Maybe that should be elaborated on  Maybe something 
[03:55:30]  Maybe it should tie up  That loose end  You know what  I was the greatest enabler  I just  I was like  Tommy  Do your thing  Like some people  Try to say  Hey  Why don't we try this  Or shoot it  You know  This way  Have it make more sense  I'm like  No no no  Just  You know  Just let it go downhill  Just let it crash  Let it be the perfect train wreck  Just let Tommy do his thing  So I just  I didn't challenge him  I never really challenged him  I just  Let him be himself  Now  And why green screen  The rooftop sequences  Wasn't there a way 
[03:56:00]  To get on a rooftop  And just film it  Yeah  There are a lot of rooftops  In LA  Yeah  I think it was part  Kind of trying to be sci-fi  Like I think he thought  If they used green screen  And plugged in a background  It would make it  Kind of  You know  Cutting edge  Cutting edge  And kind of  You know  Cool  And so  Yeah  It didn't  You know  That's just  One of the most bizarre  Parts of the film  Yeah  It kind of  Doesn't really look  Like San Francisco  When you look  In the background  Like you turn one angle  And it's like  Bright sunshine  And then you turn around  It's like  It looks like  You're in Istanbul 
[03:56:30]  Yeah  So it's just  Yeah  Yeah  It was  That green screen  Is something else  It's done very  Very poorly  And then  The obsession  With the football  What is  What is that  You know what  When I first met Tommy  We first started rehearsing  For an acting class  I was really into soccer  So  This random time  We went out  And played soccer  In Golden Gate Park  And he was like  Really into it  Another time  I brought my football  And so we played catch  And you know  Were you further apart 
[03:57:00]  In real life  Throwing it back and forth  Yeah  Yeah definitely  Or were you three feet  Apart from each other  Throwing the football  Tommy likes three feet apart  Because then you can  You know  Hide his spiral  Ah okay  We're watching a scene  Right now  Where you're  Tossing the ball  Oh my god  Oh yeah  Yeah I love  Toss it in the parking lot  He loves to throw  Kind of like that  Shot put throw  That's his specialty  Yeah he doesn't really  Have a good arm there  Yeah but he's really clumsy  That's it I'm done 
[03:57:30]  Great idea  Come on  And then  Like that meant  That meant no  Yeah that was just like  Okay why  Because even  It did not advance  The storyline  Not much does  No  When I was re-watching  That like a few years later  I  It even fooled me  I thought oh  That was for like  The wedding announcement  But it wasn't  It wasn't  No  It was just  A scene  Basically in tuxedos  And I know  One of the draws 
[03:58:00]  For him was  He got to call me  Babyface  Which was the real life  Nickname that he had used  For me when we were  Acting class  When we were in acting class  So  Babyface  Yeah it just gets weirder  It really is  Can we see this  This famous  Oh yeah  The  You're tearing me apart  Lisa  That's his moment  Yeah  You are lying  I never hit you  You are tearing me apart  Lisa  And he does have  A unique look  To him 
[03:58:30]  It's this  Yeah he's got  Kind of like  The rocker  Vampire  Look  And what's so great  About him  Is he's  He's gung ho  About being  The leading man  You know  That's what he  Casts himself as  Yeah  We got to play  The trailer  For the people  That don't know  The room  Oh yeah  Sure  Hold on  Start it over  There  Rated R  Well  Sexuality  Language  A little saucy  A perfect world

[03:59:30]  It's not true  That hit her  Well maybe you should  Have a girl Mark  Yeah  Yeah maybe you're right  Maybe I have one already  I don't know yet  You can't do this  This is great  Johnny's my best friend  This will be our secret  Don't worry  You can trust me  Who were I expecting  Are you sure about that  Please talk to me  Please  You're having an affair  With Lisa aren't you  I need more from life  Than what Johnny can give me 
[04:00:00]  She's a sociopath  She can't love anyone  There is no baby  I told him that  To make it interesting  She's such a manipulative witch  You're hurting yourself  You're hurting our friendship  I treat you like a princess  And you stop me  In the back  You are tearing me apart  Shut Lisa  Oh  Hey Denny  What the hell is wrong with you  Shut up  Hey  Get out of this world  The Room 
[04:00:30]  A film with the passion  Of Tennessee Williams  Directed by Tommy Wiseau  The best movie of the year  What?  Experience this quirky  New black comedy  It's a riot  Oh wow  That's a great trailer  I don't know what  I just watched  It's kind of like  You want to make a smoothie  And you put everything  Into the blender  You have TV crashes  Kisses  Like guns  You know  Yeah yeah yeah  Everything in one trailer  And you're like  Okay  I don't know what  I just watched  I don't know what that is 
[04:01:00]  But I think I gotta see it  Yeah  Yeah  What about some of the other cast  Have you spoken with them  About this kind of cult  Yeah  When I was writing the book  I interviewed  And spoke to just about everybody  They're all great  They have a great sense of humor about it  Oh they do  Okay  I think we all kind of knew  What we were involved in  It's like we kind of have this bond  You know  We went through Vietnam  Yeah  So yeah  They're all very cool  Yeah talk about the book  We're promoting that today  I got eggshell on my throat 
[04:01:30]  Sorry  I have eggshell in my world  I got eggs  After watching that  It's better my throat apart  After watching that trailer  Yeah  Wow  Anyway  The Disaster Artist  Is the name of the book right  Yeah  And it's the making of the movie  Pretty much  Yeah  The experience  Yeah making of the movie  And like my journey in LA  Kind of my friendship with Tommy  And how that kind of  You know  Burred the film  Nice  Now what I hear tell about a movie  About the movie  Yeah  Yeah  I think when I was writing the book 
[04:02:00]  That was kind of the vision  I always saw this as a film  Right  You know  Because it was just  You couldn't believe  That it actually happened  And so yeah  It's in the process  Of being made into a film  And who plays Tommy?  I think James Franco  Would make a  James Franco  That's the rumor out there  That is the rumor  And that would be really good  Seth Rogen told us  Actually it's going down  Yeah  He's  I mean  James Franco wrote an incredible review 
[04:02:30]  About the book  For Vice  You really got it  Like I feel like with this  If you're going to make this into a film  You've got to really  You know  Understand the movie  And kind of understand what it's like  Yeah  To be creative  And try to make art  And I think that  Just reading his review of the book  Was brilliant  And you know  He can do drama  He can do comedy  And you know  Seth Rogen is such a great producer  So I mean  You couldn't have asked for  Two better people  To make this film  Did he know when to end the movie? 
[04:03:00]  Like some people don't really know  When they should just stop  And call it a wrap  And you know  I thought it was going to go on forever  Because we were going up to San Francisco  To shoot establishing shots  And I had just  Broken up with my girlfriend at the time  And he's like  Why don't we do a scene about this?  And I was like  This was supposed to be establishing shots  Now we're going to shoot a scene  About me breaking up with my girlfriend  In the movie  So that scene in the coffee shop 
[04:03:30]  Where he's like  How's your sex life?  It's about us talking  Kind of about me just breaking up  It's a movie about nothing  Yeah it was just added in  Just thrown in  And then he's like  Why don't we do a scene of me  Walking through Golden Gate Park  Or jogging  And so  The flower shop was the last scene  Thank God  That shot's great  Yeah it ended up  Working out perfectly  Because what a way to go out on  That is  It's timed so poorly  Yeah we gotta play this  Yeah yeah  This is fantastic  From the movie The Room 
[04:04:00]  Hi  Can I help you?  Yeah can I have a dozen red roses please?  Oh hi Johnny  I didn't know it was you  How did she not know?  Here you go  That's me  How much is it?  It'll be $18  Here you go  Keep the chain  Hi doggy  You're my favorite  Hi doggy  Bye  Bye bye  Oh my god  She didn't even say how much it was  No  And he goes  Oh he is to keep the chain  And I love  How did you know  She didn't know it was him  It's him until he took his sunglasses off  And you know 
[04:04:30]  It's either him or Ronnie James Dio  Just walked in  I think a lot of vampires  Shot for flowers  In that area  That's true  In that area  You might have needed another take too  Because her acting is horrendous  Oh my god  It's so bad  I love it  Horrible  She had a look of disbelief  When we walked in there  And said we want to film a movie  Oh okay  So  She was just stunned  She's like oh okay  And that was in San Francisco  Yeah it was in San Francisco  Oh so that was  The establishing shots  I guess  What the  The Golden Gate Bridge  Yeah the Golden Gate Bridge 
[04:05:00]  We did the full house thing  Twin Peaks  Right  Buildings  TRW building  Whatever that was  Yeah what's great about that  Is like you panned to that  But then you're not really there  Right  It's like  They're kind of glamour shots  Of San Francisco  But then we're back inside  An apartment  It's incredible  It doesn't make any sense  I love it  I just learned that she wasn't  An actress for the movie  So he just said  We're going to film you  For my movie  I don't know how he worked  With somebody that wasn't  A professional  Right  It's terrible  It just added to the charm  Yes it certainly does 
[04:05:30]  You still talk to him  Yeah when I was writing the book  I went on like  Kind of tour with him  And went around  All the different spots  And interviewed him  And talked to fans  And stuff  So we'll still  Toss the football  Occasionally  Toss that football around  He sure does like that  He's gotten better though  He can  Yeah  He can throw it now  He can  He can whip the thing  A little bit  So when the movie  Was finished  Then what  Like what did he say  We're going to get this  In theaters  He had a premiere  Yeah  Which went kind of  According to plan 
[04:06:00]  There was laughter  Throughout the entire premiere  Oh no  And I think  He was just kind of stunned  And he rolled with it  And he just kept pushing it  He had a theater show  In LA every month  And he'd show up  And do Q&As  Students kind of  Discovered it  And started spreading it  And it just kind of  Kept going  That's fascinating actually  So when he first started that  There was no one in the theater  No  Right  There was these  Can you find friends  Or somebody  To at least go in the theater  And check out the movie  There were a couple  Film students 
[04:06:30]  That  Discovered it in the valley  And  They just started bringing  All their friends to it  And built this  Kind of small  LA cult  Base  And then that just kept  Growing  Spreading and spreading  Yeah  Yeah because this was before  You know  Twitter and everything else  That makes it a little easier  To get some shit out there  Yeah  Yeah there's a writer  For Entertainment Weekly  His name's Clark Collis  He came out  Like 2008  And I think  Tim and Eric  Took him to a screening  And he's like 
[04:07:00]  It was dead silent  At midnight  He pops into this theater  And there's like  Flying spoons  And he's just like  What in the hell  He said it was like  One of the most fun experiences  He's had in the theater  So he came back here  And he's like  I gotta write a story about it  And so he  Found out it was being studied  In universities  And so he wrote  This great article on it  And that's just  What kind of blew it up  Wow  And was there  Some kind of a  Premiere with a  Red carpet thing  Did he  Did he want to  Go that route  Yeah we did  That's where he had  A premiere  At Fairfax 
[04:07:30]  In Beverly  Which is now  Has homeless people  Living in front of it  I drove by it the other day  And I'm like  This is perfect  And so  He got like  The limo  And everything  We had a premiere  And then  After that  It just kind of  Showed once a month  You know  And he would show up  And do Q&As  And people would be like  Oh what's your workout routine  And he'd be like  Oh I do both legs  And so  But yeah  He just kept it going  And then  It was crazy  In 2010  We did a big screening 
[04:08:00]  At the Ziegfeld Theater  And it sold out  Like a week before  And I'd overheard  Someone saying  That was the first time  Since like the re-release  Of Star Wars  And I thought  I mean  What's going on here  And people are coming up  And being like  Congratulations  I'm like  Well it's cool  That it's sold out  But like  I can't watch the movie  You know what I mean  It's like  It's really great  But it's  You know  It's kind of  A double-edged sword there  No shit  That's  Just a  Fantastic  Story  Just amazing  How  Things just 
[04:08:30]  Kind of  Take hold like that  Yeah  It should have just been  Something that just  Went away  Yeah  That's  Exactly  That's what I thought  Because I mean  How many movies come out  That are great  That you never see again  I mean I've auditioned  For so many films  Never even see the light of day  Yeah  This film is  You know  Now it's everywhere  It's crazy  And has he made another movie  Since Tommy  He hasn't  I mean I know he's had  Some ambitious ideas  For new films  But you know  Nothing so far  I know he's probably  Working on it 
[04:09:00]  So what's his day-to-day  Life about  Probably pull-ups  And  Watching the room  And  He's just sitting there  Watching it  So you don't really know  What he's up to  Pull-ups  He's just kind of mysterious  You know you never know  It's so weird  What he's up to  Really strange  It's a great story  And again  What's the title of the book  The Disaster Artist  Yeah  The Disaster Artist  And it's out now  The movie about  The Room  Sam  And I would 
[04:09:30]  Huffington Post  Posted an article about it  But you have to get  The audio book  Because Greg does the reading  For the audio book  And he does  His Tommy impression  Throughout the entire book  Yeah that is a really good  Tommy impression  And it's perfect  And so it's like  You're sitting  Because that's when  I said we were  Driving for several hours  Over the last week  Yeah  And I was listening to that  And I was listening to the book  On tape  And just listening to him  Do his Tommy impression  You like the book?  Yeah it's really good  Yeah I have it  I have it at home  I definitely want to  Pop it in  And give it a listen 
[04:10:00]  The bizarreness  Of the movie  Is like nothing  Compared to the bizarreness  Of just his life  With Tommy  It's incredible  I really  Give us one  I mean  I got one  Yeah go for it  Roland gave me one  No I mean  Give us  Give us a story  A story  I mean  Where do you start?  Yeah  Like I mean  Right from the beginning  When he has this whole scheme  Of going into a restaurant  Oh here's a good one  Here's a good one  When he meets him  In acting class 
[04:10:30]  And  He doesn't know  Who Tommy is  But Tommy obviously  As he just said  Is this guy  Who's arguing with the teacher  And he's this bizarre dude  That was performing  This terribly acted scene  And then he goes  Okay I want to be  A scene partner  And he picks him up  In this beautiful  New Mercedes  And has the  Greatest  Weirdest  Conversation  About when he should  And shouldn't  Be talking about his car  What?  Yeah  Like as if he was  Already famous  Yeah  Yeah yeah 
[04:11:00]  It's like Tommy was famous  Before he was famous  Before he was famous  Really weird  And he said  He said  It was back to the car  Greg  They wanted to  Put a scene with the car  In the movie  And Greg was like  Alright well we'll just  Use your car  Cause the shot  Is only from like  The side view mirror up  Right  And Tommy goes  Oh no we can't do that  The license plate issues  License plate issues  What does that even mean?  It's correct  Weird  It was a lot  I'll give that a listen  Absolutely 
[04:11:30]  What a great story  And then the movie  Will be made  With Seth Rogen  Producing it  And James Franco  Playing  Yeah  What's crazy is that  Wait who's playing Tommy?  Did we figure that out?  James Franco  Oh Tommy  Who's playing you?  Do you know yet?  We don't know  We don't know yet  Okay  But yeah  What's crazy is  James Franco  Played James Dean  Back in like 2001  And did an incredible job  Like every actor  Wants to play James Dean  And we all think  We can do it  And we failed miserably  But he was incredible  As James Dean 
[04:12:00]  And Tommy actually saw  He saw the performance  That Franco gave  As James Dean  Oh really?  And actually that was  One of the big inspirations  For Tommy to  Show his rear end  In the movie  Because when James Franco  Played James Dean  He did that  And so Tommy's like  Okay if he do it  I have to do it  Wow full circle  So it's like a full circle  Yeah  That was during  The sex scene  That played twice  In the movie  Yeah two or three times  The same  It's the same scene  You gotta  After you watch  The Room  You have to watch it 
[04:12:30]  Like after you  Familiarize yourself with it  Yeah  You gotta watch it  With a new person  Because I showed it  To Jess  Like two weeks ago  For the first time  And I made her  Watch the entire thing  I said no quitting  And no quitting  She's watching  Like it's like  First she asked  The same thing  That Greg said  People were asking  On the set  Which is  Is this a porno?  No it's not a porno  It kind of  It wishes it was  Yeah  It kind of has a look  Of some of the  Soft core  Old cable porn  Cinemax 
[04:13:00]  Which is  But you never see the girl  The girl is never featured  It's just this like  Corpse on top  Of the girl  He wanted to be featured  Yeah it's him  It's him being featured  I mean who wants  You know  Everybody's there  To see the girl  Freaking fantastic  So she's watching it  And like the first sex scene  Is real quick  Into the movie  It's like 10 minutes in  And then 20 minutes later  Is the next sex scene  And Jess is going  This looks just like  The first one  And I'm just  I don't say a thing  And she keeps watching  And she goes wait  This is  Shot for shot 
[04:13:30]  Not re-shot  The exact same scene  Right  Play again  And then there's a line  Where he's like  My Lisa's great  When I can get it  I'm like dude  You got it  Like for the whole  What an experience  Wow  Yeah  Greg  Thanks for coming in  And I'm going to  I'm going to have to  Pop your audio book in  And  Absolutely  Keep us posted  I love the show  So thanks so much  For having me  You know of us 
[04:14:00]  Thank you sir  Whoa  Look at us  That's nice  Big shots  That's very nice  Have you done anything  Since in acting  You know what  I just did a film  It stars Patton Oswalt  And Andrew W.K.  It's  My buddies run a website  Called Five Second Films  Really funny  Kind of just shorts  I've seen some of that stuff  Yeah they're making  Actually really funny  Yeah they're making  A full length feature  What  20 seconds long  And 
[04:14:30]  Anyway  So I had a part in that  And it was really cool  To say new dialogue  And work on something new  Right right  Something a little different  Yeah  And do the parents  Support your acting now  Um  They're  Yeah  They're oddly on board  I think  Finally  I took a  A situation that  You know  Was a sinking  You know  Sinking ship  Like the Titanic  And tried to  Make something out of it  So I think  They're cool  They're cool for now  Nice  Very cool  Alright  Cool man  Thanks for coming in  And best of luck 
[04:15:00]  Yeah we'll see you  When the film comes out  Yeah definitely  That's a good year away  Though probably right  Something like that  Yeah something like that  Probably  Alright we'll see you again  Then man  Cool man  Thank you  Thanks Greg  Absolutely  ONA will be right back  On Sirius XM  You could change the channel  But it would be  A horrible regret  Memorial Day week is here

[04:23:00]  The O.P. and Anthony show is over  Fortunately  We have a hard time letting go  The stories behind the stories  Behind the stories  The backstage drama  Everything that made today  Unforgettable  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW  Now  And look back on another legendary day  Broadcasting  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show  With Sam Roberts  Yes sir 
[04:23:30]  Welcome  To the O.P. and Anthony Post Show  Breaking down everything that happened  Today  The first day back  From the big  Eight day vacation  Sal spent most of the time  Camping and watching  Don't Mess With The Zohan  That's something we got  From today's show  It's cool  Did you have fun? 
[04:24:00]  I didn't go camping  What?  I did not go camping  So just a lot of Zohan then?  No  What?  I did watch The Room though  You did?  I did  You're so excited about  Greg Sestero coming in today huh?  Dude my one sheet today  Was fucking killer  You know what?  I read it  Because I always like reading  Because  Sal does all the guest one sheets  The prep sheets  When guests come in  As if O.P. and Anthony  Will read them  And I used to do them  So it would be like  When a wrestler came in  They would have these  Immaculately detailed  Work of art one sheets 
[04:24:30]  With every fact you could  Want to know  And the inside stuff  And everything  And I was noticing Sal  That you finally did a good job  With a one sheet today  Yeah it was  Look at all these facts  You had to single space it  You had to shrink the font  No creative like  No we have to skip two spaces here  So they can read the Twitter handle properly  Exactly  No no that was like  Packed  Yeah  Packed the fuck out  Like how much  How much  How much area  Does a sheet of paper contain  Because I want to fill it with ink  I made the margins even narrow 
[04:25:00]  You did  Yeah it's a wide piece of paper  And it wasn't even because  You wanted to do a good job  You just wanted to write  About the room  Well yeah I mean  I just knew a lot of things  Like you know  A lot of times it's just  Because I was reading the book as well  Like you know  A lot of things you were saying  I knew as well  And I just tried to give  As best info as I can on there  It's a weird thing  Of course we had Greg Sestero  Who wrote  The Disaster Artist  In studio a few minutes ago  And it's always strange  Because the people  Who like this movie  That he was a part of  That he's writing about  In the disaster area 
[04:25:30]  Called The Room  The people who like it  Know every detail about it  They're obsessed with it  The people  Who don't know about it  Have no idea  So you wonder  You know  I think today's interview  Went really well  Because you know  Oh and I have a familiarity  With the movie  But it wasn't  You know  It wasn't one of these things  Where they went so inside  That somebody who hasn't seen it  Has no idea  What they're talking about  I do wonder though  If the majority  Of the listeners  Who listen to this show  Have seen The Room  Have seen The Room 
[04:26:00]  Or not  I think if you're a cult  If you're into like  Cult movies and stuff like that  This is something that  Is you've seen  Or it's on your radar to see  Because it's  It's the most famous  Bad movie of all time  Yeah and I think also  It depends on  On where you're at  Like I feel like  If I had gone to college  Maybe three or four years later  This is one of those things  That like freshman year  You get obsessed with  Yeah it's funny  Because me and my friends  Became obsessed with  Tim and Eric  Right  Early on in college  And there is a scene 
[04:26:30]  With Tommy Wiseau  Directing and producing  A Tim and Eric bit  And it's the weirdest  Fucking thing  He does this thing  Called Pig Man  Yeah  It makes no sense  And Tommy Wiseau  Is overacting  And all that sort of stuff  So we're like  We saw the scene  We saw the  The scene where  He goes and buys the flowers  And we were like  Dude what the fuck  Is that  We have to see this  And that's how we got  Turned onto the room  Do you like it better  Than Don't Mess with the Zohan  Oh absolutely  I was getting a good laugh today  Out of your enjoyment  Because another thing  We did today  Was we tried to break down  Opie did we get an answer 
[04:27:00]  As to when Adam Sandler  Stopped making good movies  Oh hi Sam  Oh hi Opie  Oh hi Sam  Did we get an answer  As to when the Adam Sandler train  Pumped the brakes on  Because we never  We always restart that segment  Sal ruined it for me  He did right  He did sort of like Zohan  There was something  Really quirky and weird  About that movie  And I did like it  But then  Sal picks out  Like two horrendous scenes  And now I'm embarrassed  I said I kinda like that movie  Well yeah that's why  I mean  Are you saying  That's my boy  Was really good 
[04:27:30]  I actually heard  That was good  Joseph Cumia said it  But we didn't get  To his phone call today  With Ant's brother  And a few of  A few of the people  On my Twitter  Just said  That's my boy  Was pretty good  What was that one about  That was the one  Where he was  Andy Samberg's dad  And he came back  To reunite  After like  Andy Samberg  Was an adult  I haven't seen it  But I have heard  That was good  I wonder sometimes  If Adam Sandler  Has ruined his reputation  Like we won't go see  A funny Adam Sandler movie  Because there's so many  Bad ones 
[04:28:00]  I've seen most of them  You have  You watch the bad ones  Just in case  The Jennifer Aniston one  With Brooklyn Decker  Was just bad  It was  Yeah  It was bad  That's unfortunate  I do like the water boy  Yeah I know you do  You made that perfectly clear  Abundantly clear  What are you promoting  Of mine today  Well  Everybody  Everybody wants a taste  Of what life is like  For Opie off the air  And that's why  I think it's so valuable  To go to the  Opie Radio YouTube channel 
[04:28:30]  And you can see  Opie playing with  His baby lion  It's all drugged up  From some guy  With baby lion scars  All over his face  Well we're going to  Talk about that tomorrow  We didn't get to  Talk about it today  But  I think we talked  About it a little bit  Right  Yeah  I held the baby lion  And then  When I was looking  At the video  A few times  On my phone  I'm like  God damn  This thing was  Drugged up  And now  I feel bad  And I'm getting  Some haters  Some animal crew  How come  I'm getting some of  The like  Kind of  Sort of  Peta people  Pissed off  Oh  They're not our fans  No 
[04:29:00]  They don't seem to be  It doesn't seem to be  The typical hater fan  That we have  Right  We have a lot of  What we call  Hater fans  It's really strange  We're not even sure  If they actually  Like the show  But they listen  I don't know  I don't know  Where they come from  It's really strange  But  The guy definitely  Had a really  Banged up face  That looked  Very obvious  That  I don't think  The video does it justice  Like he was mauled  Like he was mauled  By a tiger  So this must have been  His thing for many years  And he has nothing else  To fall back on  So I think the baby lion  Might have mauled his face  And it healed 
[04:29:30]  But the scars are brutal  Like he never  He never learned  How to fix a car  No  So he's like  Fuck  My face is mauled  But this is all I know  So I gotta find another  Baby lion  And get back in it  Huh  I think  Yeah I mean  It was outside  The Tulum  The Tulum  Mine Ruins  It does tell you  Something about  Your desperation in life  Right  When you have to  Keep handling baby lions  After you have  Lion scars  On your face 
[04:30:00]  Yes  Of course  Like Siegfried and Roy  Don't perform anymore  You'd be proud though  He wanted $20  To hold a baby lion  I got him down to $10  You think  I just talked about  His desperation  And you think  I'm proud of you  For haggling him down  What you were sharing  So I figured I would share  I mean  I'm proud of that  I appreciate you sharing  He wants $20  And I go  Nah man  My bus is leaving  $15  $15  I'm like nah man  I gotta go $10  I figured at that point  It was worth a $10 spot  Well you can actually see it  In the video 
[04:30:30]  That I'm quickly  Handing over the money  Before I held the baby lion  Well you should feel  Very ashamed of yourself  That lion was drugged  Tranked  I did a $50  Mashup video too  Oh that's right  We didn't even get  To talk about  Yo kid  That's funny  But he didn't get  $50 to retweet it  Well I don't know  How does $50 feel  About the pitch  He's gotta like  Laugh it off  Worst pitch ever  And then I  We meshed up  With little  You know movie clips  And Susan Waltman  It's on my YouTube channel 
[04:31:00]  Give it some views  We didn't even get  Today to a lot of  The stories that we  Missed over the vacation  The $50 first pitch  There's like  Five or six apologies  Oh can you say  The apologies for tomorrow  Yeah yeah yeah  I never got to  I never even read  A newspaper today  Yeah because you  Jumped on the air  As soon as you got  It was a fun show  It was a fun show  I'm refreshed  Good  That's your last  Until Tuesday  Next week  Yeah I mean you  Say you're refreshed  But at the same time  You came in  And you kept making  References to the fact  That you wouldn't be here  After this contract today 
[04:31:30]  Yeah it's gonna be  Really tough to continue  I'm not gonna lie to you  Why  I got a few other  Places to go  And  Where  You wanna go  Can I come  Can I have a spot  Yeah  Mars  I need one  Come on  Are you kidding me  Mars me after today  Come on  They got some strong engineers  Where I'm thinking of going  Strong  I have to tell you  What was going on  Behind the scenes  During the Mars segment today  Yeah  Travis and me  And Troy  We were all like  What the fuck is Mars doing  Right 
[04:32:00]  He's throwing himself  Under the bus  Mars is putting himself  In the barrel  You can't go on the air  And say that you're more loyal  To Opie and Anthony  Than to the company  At this point  Bro  I don't give a fuck  You don't  Do you  No  You don't  They play fucking games  And they try to  You gotta pay your bills  Chill  Yeah I know  That's what we were saying  I understand that  Don't follow my lead  I don't have to pay bills anymore  Yeah guess what  Guess what my loyalty is like  I'm not gonna take those phone calls  Not with Blondie  My loyalty is down the hall  Cause I have bills to pay  That's fucked up man  There's the difference  I can talk like this 
[04:32:30]  I never have to work again  Right but see  I'm just honest with it myself  You gotta chill  You gotta chill  For real  I'm not  This isn't even a radio bed  Chill  You got bills to pay  You need benefits  You got children  You're right man  You need the benefits  But they needed an escape goat man  An escape goat?  Escape goat  You said escape goat  Escape goat  They're always fucking with you Mexicans man  There you go  You Mexicans  You don't give a fuck  You're sure you're not Mexican  Cause you look very similar  To the people I saw all week  I've always assumed Mexican  We'll look alike  I've always assumed 
[04:33:00]  Are you guys all the same people  You just call yourselves different names  We probably are  Hispanics  We all probably come from the same place  I think so  Mexicans are just west coast Hispanics  They're just a larger group of us  I don't know  Larger group  Teach me the rules  You Mexicans are very confusing  By the way  Can I defend one thing in my baby lion video?  I guess  Cause we got really  We got a lot of strange people  That love commenting on our looks  You get that too right?  Oh god  I'm not losing my hair that much 
[04:33:30]  Okay  Maybe a little bit  Do you know  But listen  In that video  They're going for the hair loss  Yes  I was a sweaty mess  Cause I ran from the temple  Dude there's no competing  Do you know how many  You're losing your hair  Tweets I've read  I've had the same  Well you are though  I've had the same  Horrible hairline  Since I was 20  This is where it is  So look  If you look at the video  Mostly  You'll see that  I'm just a sweaty mess  And it's like  Matting up my hair a little bit  I however 
[04:34:00]  It's like 100 degrees  As I was holding the baby line  I however  Am legit losing it  You're saying  Turn sideways a little bit  You're fueling the fire right now  Look you just pushed it down  Push this up  Oh  That's the big test  Alright  I see what's going on  It's been there  You see what he does Mars  He's like  I don't understand why people hate on me  However  I will fuel them  I'll push them in this direction  You're a sheep herder  Fuck my ass  You don't know how the games play  You sheep herder 
[04:34:30]  They come back though  Mars I love the Mexican people  You guys are a nice bunch of people  I love the don't give a fuck  Mars did you really fuck up their microphones on purpose this morning  Why'd you do that  Because I knew they were going to come in and complain about the mics anyway  Because they always  Do we have to vacation  Well I hope he thinks you're lying  Why would he think that  Well because it's very weird either way  Look  If you're telling the truth that you fucked up the mics on purpose  Or if you're lying that you fucked up the mics on purpose  Either scenario is very strange  I think 
[04:35:00]  No I wanted to do something out of the ordinary  Because I knew they were going to complain about the mics anyway  And I knew they were going to go off on what didn't happen in the studio  Right  But I know it's not my fault  Right  None of that shit is my fault  That's why I don't give a fuck  I have nothing to do with buying equipment  Obtaining equipment  Getting an okay for a budget  Give me the fucking money like on 57th Street  Yeah I'll go and buy it  But I'm not that person  Like you would  If somebody gave you the cash  You would go to the store and purchase the equipment  I would get all the good shit  Right  All the good stuff  But I'm not that person  Right  So the stuff is not here 
[04:35:30]  I know I have nothing to do with it  I know they're going to  So I was ready to be the butt of the joke  Right  But  Then  Don  I was expecting Don to come  Because he was going to bring something silly  He was going to bring in a centerpiece  Right  And he was going to do things like that  Just to be silly  And he didn't show up  So I just decided to fuck with the mic  And then he came in  He came in early too  So he really caught me off guard  Yeah  I wasn't prepared for that  For him to grab the mic that early  And I said  Ah fuck it  Let him  And then when Anthony came on  I was like  Ah let me go in there 
[04:36:00]  And it was weird too  Because you let it go  Yeah  For a long time  Yeah  I'm just tired man  Yeah  I just want to fuck around  Play around  I mean yesterday  You guys have no idea  What I had to go through  They were trying to find  They were  You had to see  They were  They were looking at  Who's they?  Like your man  Your boss  Your engineer boss  Yeah  Managerial  Managerial people  Not our bosses  Your bosses  Ah yeah  What are yours too?  Okay  Yes  They all get together  See and they blame each other  But then they go  You  No you  And then the finger  Goes  No that guy 
[04:36:30]  Right there  Standing in the corner  And they go  Oh I can blame him too  Yeah Mars  Well they know better  They know better  Because they know  That I'm going to speak up  And I did  You did  Yeah  And then when I go  And see them now  Oh hi Mars  It's like  They expected that  So I actually  Told you guys  That the renovation  Is not going to happen  Officially  Before someone else did  Right?  Officially  Yeah  So that person's happy  Because you guys  They know  He didn't have to deliver  The message  Oh I see  Okay so here's how  The game works  They figure out 
[04:37:00]  Who to blame  They find you  And you're not going  To get to talk  To Obi and Anthony  Until the next day  When they're not around  Right  So then you go  Well you can't blame me  It's them  Right  They're not there anymore  So you don't get the blame  They're not there  To get blamed  And it just floats  Into that cloud  Of problems  Yes  That's it  That's the game  That's it  But the reality is  That you know  They ain't getting  Shit done in the studio  You don't think so  I don't see it man  Did we hear right  Earlier today 
[04:37:30]  That it's going to be  Like next year  2015  Is that what we're  Looking at right now  I didn't hear that  But that's possible  I mean I don't hear everything  I'm not up in those  Managerial positions  Well they don't trust you  You run off  At the bath at times  Doesn't this feel like  An office conversation  That's happening on air  Right now  How so  It just has that sort of feel  Like all this  All this stuff  Should have been said  Behind the scenes  But Mars is just  Fucking going for it  Yeah I love  And I think people  Appreciate it  Just the Mars  Like don't give a fuck  Like this is like  The type of conversations 
[04:38:00]  That not only do you  Have in the office  But you kind of  Look around  To make sure  Nobody's walking by  That shouldn't be listening  Definitely  Yeah yeah yeah  Mars is just like  I don't give a fuck  You know  And I don't necessarily  Think it's  I don't give a fuck  I'm not smart enough  To lie  Right  Sometimes  I don't know  Where to begin  And where to end  So you know what  To avoid all that shit  I just tell you  What's going on  There was like  Like one time  There was an incident  Where you needed  Another studio right  So there was a lot  Of talk about  Moving you to other 
[04:38:30]  Studios  But you was impinging  On other people  And they were getting  There was an uproar  Behind the scenes  My god  We didn't know  About this uproar  We didn't know  About this  What studio was it  Was it  Yeah  It was the  Entertainment Weekly studio  Right  So it was  And by the way  That right there  Is Mars in a nutshell  Like you said  Sometimes he's too stupid  To lie  So he goes  He knows  He shouldn't say it  But he doesn't know  How to handle the situation  So he goes  Uh  Uh  Entertainment Weekly  Okay 
[04:39:00]  So that was a big deal  Because it was a lot  For something  For them  You know  It was their studio  And um  The things that you wanted  Were already in the studio  So I  In the little studio  You're talking about  For the pre-show  Right  So I chimed in  I said  Hey  Why don't we just  Keep it there  I mean  This is where he's got  Everything that he needs  Rarely is he gonna  Have a fucking guest  At 6 o'clock in the morning  Right  Alright  So I mean  Who else do you need  In the studio  People don't wanna see me  In the middle of the day  Let alone early in the morning  So when I said that  Everybody  From the company 
[04:39:30]  Was like  Hooray  Mars for president  And all this  And the other thing  Uh huh  But then there was one guy  That pulled me aside  And said  Hey  Why don't you talk to me  We need to be on the same  Sheet of music  Right  Same sheet of music  Is that what he said to you  We need to be on the same  Sheet of music  Come on  Yeah but you know  No one  No one discusses it with me  So how do you know  What was the  The ulterior motive  Right  And even if they do  Discuss it with you  They don't know 
[04:40:00]  What you're saying  Cause half the time  You're talking about  Being on the same  Sheet of music  Is that the way  The saying goes  That's not an expression  At all  You just made that up  Dude  Did I  Yeah  Yeah it would be  The same page  You could say page  Sheet of music  Sheet of music  Otherwise what are we doing  We're playing different songs  Exactly  We have to work together  As a band  Right  So what are you saying  The guy who got mad at you  Was he mad that  He didn't get to  Why was he mad  That you guys weren't  On the same sheet of music  Because I didn't know  What the ulterior motive was  And what was the ulterior motive  Ah you know 
[04:40:30]  Let's leave that one alone  You know  They just wanted  Another studio  And I thought  That staying here  Was better  But if I would have been told  So you're saying  That you were looking  For the more functional  Exactly  And maybe people  With ulterior motives  And different sheets of music  Could have been looking  Ulterior  Could have been  Ulterior  I believe  Could have been looking  Just to have the studio  At their disposal  Yeah  Gotcha  And I didn't know  That's what the case was  So I mean  Things get so complicated 
[04:41:00]  Around here  But I love it  Mars  Mars has no filter  Well  Let me know  When I need to  Put the filter on  And then I'll  You know  I'll filter  Look I wear a lot  Of different hats  Right now  This hat that I'm wearing  From 10.30 to 11  Is host of the post show  Right  And I am not the guy  Who is ever  Going to tell you  When to put a filter on  As a matter of fact  I'm going to be like  No I think he's wrong  I think he can take off  The filter  I don't think you need  To worry about it  No I know you might  No I don't think  You'll get in trouble  But you know  I also am not that stupid 
[04:41:30]  I don't say stuff  That'll get me outright  Fired  Right  Just stuff that will  Slowly build a case  Against you  If that's the case  Then you know  We'll see  That's right  Murder was the case  Right  Yeah  Nothing to worry about  But it doesn't  It doesn't bother me  There's a lot of  You know  A lot of bullshit  Going on  So  Yeah  I gotta get used to  You using this  Wireless mouse  Why  Well I'm used to  Having a cord  To hold me back  Right  And I'm down  Now I'm bringing  This mouse towards me  It's messing up  My whole mojo  Let's go to Fontaine 
[04:42:00]  Fontaine  Welcome to the  O.B. and Anthony  Post show  What's up Mars  Hey Sal  Hey  Sam  I got a lot of  Respect for you buddy  For even taking the call  Because you see  What I want to say  Yeah  Gosh man  I totally respect you  For taking the call  I'm not even going  To say it now  But I will say  If Mars does that shit again  You should smack his hands  With a fucking spatula  He's bringing it back  To your mom  Smacking your hands  With a spatula  I got that stupid  I'm just  Why is he saying that 
[04:42:30]  What would I do again  You're the engineer  Right  You're responsible  For making sure  Technically everything  Is working in order  Oh  And you went out  Of your way  To make sure  The mics did not work  First time in ten years  I did some stupid shit  Like that  That I really wanted  To intentionally  I just said  Fuck it  You know  It's about that time  It's very strange  I got other tricks  Up my sleeves  You do  What are you going to do  What's next  I have no idea  Tell me  Tell me what's next  No  You're a great person  To share a secret with  Yeah  Why is that  Yeah I'm being sarcastic  Oh  You mean because 
[04:43:00]  I tend to go off  At the mouth too  Just a little bit  Yeah  Yes  The announcer  You have tricks  The announcer  The announcer  Did you hear what  He referred to me  As Sal  Yeah  I'm the announcer  Mark says  Tricks up his shirt  Is that what he said  No  Just fucking up expression  Um  Tricks huh  Yeah  Tricks  You're going to keep  Them coming huh  Oh nah nah  I just wait  Everybody loves a comedian  Don't they  Do you like the room  That I gave you though  I do  Although it was very strange today 
[04:43:30]  Cause my chair doesn't  For whatever reason  And I'm not going to jump on this  Complaining about a chair bandwagon  Right  My chair doesn't go up anymore  I have nothing to do with that  You're not the chair guy  The end  That's everything  On 57th street  When it was just you  It was everything  Was on me baby  Right  Here it's like  I don't handle the chairs  Exactly  I handle the microphones  I handle the mic stands  I don't do chairs  I don't do panels  I don't do vacuuming  I don't do coffee  Yeah we learned that today  Early on on the show  Um  But yeah  You got all 
[04:44:00]  Yeah so  So the chair  Doesn't raise anymore  So now when I sit back there  I feel like I'm hiding  Behind the monitors  Yeah  Which isn't such a bad thing  If you want me to  I could lower that  Uh  No  No  I like uh  I like being out of the line of sight  Especially the EROC  EROC is back to running the board now  Oh is he  Yes  Oh  And Opie's monitor  That looks at EROC  Is in his eyesight  Okay  And right past the monitor  I am now covered  Yes  I like being out of eyesight  Okay  I like to not make a splash  Okay  You know that's  That's the 
[04:44:30]  The key to survival  Right now  Being incognito  Don Wicklin and Tim Sabian  Are right outside this studio  Thinking  What they're gonna do to you Mars  We gotta shut this guy up  Sam Rowland texted me  Mmhmm  He goes  Can you order a cake for tomorrow  Put it on one of your credit cards  Have the cake say  Good luck Mars  Enjoy your new adventures  Best of luck  In your future endeavors  Thank you very much  Lady Trucker  Good morning Sam  Good morning  I really missed you  And I just woke up 
[04:45:00]  So I'm curious  What did I miss on today's show  Well of course  We started the show  And uh  We are adjusting  The four hour replay  Of course  The replay that comes on  The west coast  Encore  That starts immediately  Following this pre show  Uh post show  Normally does not include  The pre show  We get right to the meat of things  Today it will include  The pre show  Because the pre show  Was invaded and taken over  Opie and Anthony came in  Took over the pre show  And uh  It just  Wonderfully  Organically 
[04:45:30]  Melded in  To the Opie and Anthony show  But we got into  The studio build out  Of course  That's what Mars  Was in here for  Opie got into  His trip  And what a terrible  Horrible  Airline  United Airlines was  And was talking a little bit  About his trip  We talked about  Bruce Willis  His naked daughter  Sal came in  To argue the case  Of how great  Adam Sandler was  Uh  And Greg Sestero  From the room  Was in studio today  So it was a big show  And I would encourage you  To check out 
[04:46:00]  The encore  Uh  Sal  You got a line of the day  In there today?  Uh  Yes yes  I was just talking with  Yeah we're distracting him  That's the voice of God  I hear behind you  Yes that is  Here's the line  Here  Comes  The line of the day  The line of the day  The line of the day  The line of the day  I love the stuff  That's going over the counter now  Like the um  The anti-hit 
[04:46:30]  The uh  AZT  No  I don't take that stuff  I'm cured  AIDS medication  I don't think he's cured  Uh  But exciting stuff for Jim too  He was here for the first half of the show  And had to duck out  Because uh  His  His project that he's working on  Is starting to come to fruition  That's big exciting news for Jim  Jim Norton  Uh  I heard the voice of God in there Sal  Were they saying  Are they saying good things about me  Or bad things?  Yeah I don't know if uh  Maybe we should order uh 
[04:47:00]  Mars' cake  Okay so it's a Mars conversation  Yeah I think we should order the cake  Okay you heard that right Mars?  I hear it very well  That's not good is it?  Listen man I'm too old to put up with the bullshit  You are too old  Yes  You're too old to give a fuck  No I give a fuck  To put up with the bullshit  Give a fuck  Do you give a fuck about the bullshit?  When it affects me  And they try to look at me  As the fall guy?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Absolutely  Martin in Michigan  Hey Sam  What's up buddy?  I'm an associate of Dennis's 
[04:47:30]  I was wondering if he was available  For the post show today  Yes he's available  Is he coming on?  No of course he's available  I'm an associate of Dennis's  Yes Dennis Falcone is always available  Does that mean he'll be here?  Absolutely not  Why you don't like him on the show anymore?  I don't think that people need to start  Their you know  First show back  With Dennis Falcone  Got it  You know  Understood  Should I invite Lady Di to call in too?  No  You took Lady Trucker  Lady Trucker is different  Okay  You know who called me in my office 
[04:48:00]  While the show was on today?  Bobo?  No  Somebody else  Who's ready to make another appearance  On the show  Another?  She's ready to come back  Sandy?  Hi damn  Oh I thought it was Marion  No it was Sandy Kane  She called me in the office  To say hey I'm ready  I'm ready  But I'm gonna tell you man  Did you hear Snowy?  I didn't pick up Snowy  You could just hear him go  Ugh  But listen  If you get fucking David man  That's  Oh well we played  One of the bits  One of the bits we played today  You heard that  Yes  With the Intern David bit 
[04:48:30]  And what an intern  Nicole from the morning mashup is here  What's up?  You remember Intern David?  I do  We played a bit of his  I got a  I was getting texts  About Intern David  Mars is bringing him up  Anytime we play audio from Intern David  We're just reminded  We're just reminded  Of how great he was  Great  Yeah  Like beyond reproach  Special  Special is a good word  Very special  But I mean  Maybe the best personality  That's ever been on the show  I rank him up there with Tippi Tom 
[04:49:00]  Absolutely  You know  I mean  There are very few people  I want to hear audio of him  That come anywhere near David  You want to hear audio of David?  I thought you didn't like him a minute ago  I know but I just like  You know  You want to be part of the cool kids club?  Take a trip down memory lane  With that Snowy  Hey Samuel  Sorry about that  Interruption there  When you said  Danny Cain  I had the  Anywho  Mars you got to be careful man  Keep messing around like that  See what you imagine  You're going to be exposed to  Watch your job disappear man 
[04:49:30]  I hate you man  Thanks a lot man  But actually like I said  I'm not doing anything like  You know  That'll really outright fuck me up  That's true  I will  I also have  I hope  Hopefully  I have  The backup of  A certain  Blondie  You don't even have his phone number  What do you mean  You have his backup  And a certain Italian guy  Who Sal?  Not that Italian guy  Sal do you think Mars has  Opie and Anthony have Mars' back?  If the shit goes down  I think so because  You know 
[04:50:00]  Whenever they  Something goes wrong  Who are they calling for Mars?  They are  They're calling for him  Yeah but that's more like  They've been conditioned  Yeah they don't know who else to call  So they're like  Oh Mars call him  Anyone else  It's just like when you're hungry  You say  I'm hungry  When something's wrong  You go  Where's Mars?  Like you know  Mars' replacement could come in  And they'd say  Where's Mars for the first six months  They're just conditioned  I think when  If someone else in Mars' department  Would try to do the show  I don't think they could handle it  I don't think they can  That's correct  You don't think they can handle it  This show? 
[04:50:30]  I don't think that other boys  Would tolerate anybody else  And it took me a long time  To be tolerated  Now I feel I'm loved  You're part of the family?  Yeah I'm loved  It took a long time though  Okay  It took a very long time  How long?  Too long  I'm still working on it  You are still?  What about the other engineers?  Do you think they can handle  Working on this show?  They can do the work  Absolutely  It's just the personalities  That are in this room  Which is a huge part of it  Absolutely  I mean that's the part really  It's going with  What's going on in the room 
[04:51:00]  Going with the flow  I don't think  You have  You have people that  Don't find  You guys humorous  Or the show humorous  In the engineering department  In the whole building  In the world  You find people  I can't believe  You find people  That think that you're  Not you personally  But the show is very racist  And they don't like that  Very racist  And I told them  That you know  No  I mean that  That's  Why don't you just tell them  It doesn't matter  What we say on the air  It's their job  To be engineers  Like you're not content 
[04:51:30]  People  Well no  We're talking to me  About what their  Thoughts are  Thoughts are  They're not  They're not talking to me  And telling me  To come on air  And tell you this  I got you  You just asked me a question  Right  And that's what's being said  I got you  You have  People that  Can't take the volatility  Of you know  How Opie's gonna react  Or how Anthony's gonna react  Or Jimmy  Whereas some people  Have gone off the deep end  So much  What Mars did this morning  Nicole  Yeah  Is he fucked up the mics  On purpose  So they would complain  About them 
[04:52:00]  I like that  And then like  20 minutes later  Was like  I gotta tell you guys  Something  I did that on purpose  So you admitted it  Don't I like that  The whole room  Was like  What  Why  Did they not think  It was funny at all  Everybody was confused  I think  Opie turned red  With laughter  Okay good  I think he was  He told me  First of all  He doesn't believe  That you did it on purpose  He doesn't believe anything  That I do  And second of all  He doesn't believe anything  He believes every other  Fucking stereotype  Of Puerto Ricans  And that's me  That's me  In his eyes I guess  And anything I tell him  Like anything that has to do 
[04:52:30]  With honesty  Or sincerity  He thinks I'm bullshit  Is that the Puerto Rican thing  Do you think  Perhaps  Perhaps  Perhaps  You did voice on the air  One time  Your concern  He's talking about  His ex being a Puerto Rican  You worry that  That would reflect  Negatively on you  Well it did  In the beginning  He did  Remember we talked  About that  Oh we used to have  A Puerto Rican girlfriend  Yes he did  Wow  And that was  That really was a hindrance  On Mars'  Professional life  Clearly  Sorry about that  That's okay  Well you give him a call  Give him a call  Yeah  No we don't do that  Why 
[04:53:00]  We rather talk face to face  And why  Why is that  Because that's the way  We do it  That's the way we do it  Now could you call him  If you wanted to  I think I could  If I wanted to  Do you have his phone number  Now that's  A very specific question  He's been working on it  For years Nicole  Mars has been working  Since  Before the company's merged  Years ago  He's been trying  To be Opie's friend  He's been trying  To get his phone number  And Opie always  He always dangles it  In front of him though  Because he's always  Very friendly to him 
[04:53:30]  He's always very familiar  To him  And then Mars goes  Okay how about  That phone number  And Opie will make  Some joke  Oh you can't have it  I'm just kidding  And walk off  And walk off  He's like I'm still  The cool kid  And you're not  Yeah that's it  It's mean Opie  That's it  Well why don't you  Give Mars your phone number  Then  Absolutely  My dad's calling right now  Alright well you  She's gotta go too  See  Mars you go on  Damage control  Yes  And we will see you here  Tomorrow  The Opie and Anthony  West Coast Encore
