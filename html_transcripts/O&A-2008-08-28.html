<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts complaining about workplace issues: a costly broken CD player and Anthony's perpetually tangled headphones.  Their frustrations quickly transitioned into a scathing critique of Michelle Obama, focusing on her perceived demeanor, past statements, and influence on Barack Obama.  This segued into a broad discussion of the Democratic National Convention (DNC),  specifically criticizing speeches by Bill Clinton and Michelle Obama,  and making observations about the delegates.  The hosts liberally employed vulgar and offensive language throughout this segment.  A running gag centered on Michelle Obama's facial expressions, interpreted as a dislike of America.  They also highlighted Bill Clinton's thumb-pointing habit and criticized the political honesty of both Democrats and Republicans.  A caller recounted experiencing racism while wearing an Obama t-shirt, and the hosts played a McCain campaign ad using Hillary Clinton's words against Obama.  Opie's disposal of a piece of the Berlin Wall was also mentioned. A "striker" in Denver called in with a live report from the DNC.  Other callers contributed to the discussion.  Bill Burr joined the show in-studio towards the end of this segment.

Following the DNC discussion, the conversation shifted to firearms, the upcoming presidential election, and various tangents.  With Bill Burr still in-studio, Anthony detailed his extensive gun collection, his recent shooting experience, and his reasons for owning firearms for home defense, citing high home invasion rates. This sparked a broader discussion on gun ownership and the Second Amendment.  Anthony shared his interest in the Rothschild family and conspiracy theories, leading to discussions on internet censorship and microchipping. The hosts and Burr criticized the political conventions, speculated on John McCain's potential VP pick, and discussed the upcoming election and Brett Favre's move to the New York Jets.

Numerous tangents ensued, including discussions of bizarre internet videos (a cobra bite and piranhas attacking a mouse), the physiques of actors in different eras of film, health concerns (including Burr's atrophied buttock muscle), the Olympics opening ceremony, and various personal anecdotes from the hosts and Burr.  A story about a man holding hostages and sending them for beer was recounted, along with reminiscences about Del Martin, a lesbian rights activist.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a rum named "Big Black Dick" and a description of Anthony's old cell phone, alongside a played clip of Roland, a staff member known for poor diction.

The final segment, with Bill Burr still present, focused on the 2008 presidential election and Barack Obama's candidacy.  They humorously discussed the perceived elitism of Hillary Clinton and other politicians, contrasting it with staged images of Obama and Biden appearing "down-to-earth."  Speculation about White House decor changes under an Obama presidency followed, with humorous suggestions about African art.  Burr expressed anxieties about potential threats against Obama, prompting a discussion about presidential vulnerability and gun control, fueled by Burr's recent rifle purchase and his detailed account of his gun collection and reasoning behind owning firearms, citing concerns about future gun control legislation.  The conversation then touched on government surveillance, with Burr jokingly expressing indifference to phone tapping and contrasting the current surveillance climate with Cold War anxieties about Russia.  The show concluded with Burr promoting his upcoming comedy special, detailing its release date and availability.

[00:06:00]  suit in the family yeah and um she's got some ideas if you you look back and see some of the stuff  she's uh said uh some of the uh uh things she's belonged to organizations some of the uh comments  she made in her uh school thesis things just things like that uh she's kind of a little more on the  militant side than obama likes to uh let out and it's just uh it's it's infuriating that they're 
[00:06:30]  they're writing about this woman as if she's you know oh look at this they both have a they're loving  parents and they love their country and a lifetime of civil service now and and that she can't stand  america she can't stand what this country is it's been stated she said it in her own words she said  america is a mean place america is a mean place and for the first time ever she can be proud of uh of 
[00:07:00]  america first time ever and that was what a few months ago what about before that you weren't proud  to live in a country where your husband could uh get the nomination on a major ticket oh before that  you weren't proud get out of here i i really cannot stand her well the whole convention is  filled with liars oh just bull crap the whole thing hillary hates barack right hill clinton hates 
[00:07:30]  barack hates them both michelle doesn't like those guys she doesn't like america no it's just they're  all just liars and why doesn't everybody see it right you watch that i was watching uh uh some of the  convention last night and i'm just looking going they're all full of crap they're all full of crap  but in all fairness because i know we're gonna go with this the republicans are gonna have the same  just as full of crap that's where i'm at i think both sides are full of crap and and in the end who's 
[00:08:00]  who actually buys into it are there people does everybody go i know they're full of crap but i got  to pull a handle for somebody or do some people go oh yes i look how nice she is she loves america  look at this one oh bill clinton and hillary they finally love barack right they hate him let's go  over the lies bill makes believe he's still in love with his wife lie lie hillary makes believe she still  likes her husband lie or any men or any men lie allegedly who knows then you got uh then you got 
[00:08:30]  hillary making believe she likes barack lie bill clinton making believe he loves barack and could do a  good job for the country lie michelle michelle obama looking on you know and and well what is she  the proud american oh the problem lie yes jimmy bill clinton looking like he's still somehow attracted  to hillary lie lie by the way i figured out that thumb thing by the way oh the uh thumb point yeah 
[00:09:00]  the bill clinton thumb point yeah he doesn't want anyone smelling his fingers that's why he doesn't  give the old the press would get a waft oh boy would they so he keeps those fingers in close and tight  and yeah gives you the thumb you know what i mean but what if he uh what if one night uh he went with  the thumb well you just see him pointing his fist well and that could be a problem one evening too 
[00:09:30]  it's it's got to be uh noted though yesterday was a very historical day for this country was it yes it  was what happened we like we uh you know nominated a black guy oh nominated the first nomination of a  major ticket ever that's that's a very historical thing yeah all right whether you like it or hate  it we could stop there can't we huh say rah rah look what happened and then just you know move on to  business as usual yeah hey do we have the hillary spot is this the one though i don't know if it's the 
[00:10:00]  one i think that's the same one uh it's um she's quoted in both well i like the new mccain ad where they  have you know hillary clinton is basically saying you know uh mccain has what experience like foreign  policy experience or something like that and obama made a good speech in 2002 and that's the big  commercial that uh mccain's running and it's hillary that's the problem i think that this is it the  democrats have have always had is the fact that when they're um going for the nomination they beat the 
[00:10:30]  crap at each other so then when they come up and hillary goes he's the best man for the job  excuse me they were videotaping you saying he's inexperienced right yeah but there's something  that happens there's that men in black thing that happens they give the and everyone forgets what  was said during the primaries yeah biden said uh nasty things about him too and he's his vice  presidential candidate now he was saying awful things about how inexperienced he is and how mccain 
[00:11:00]  would be make a great president and our whole system is crap yeah it really is crap i think as  the years have gone by too we get so much coverage of these guys and every single word they say back  years ago you didn't you really didn't hear everything there wasn't a camera rolling when  all these candidates were talking bad about their uh fellow democrats or republicans during the primaries  now every word out of their mouths is videotaped multiple times from all these networks 24-hour 
[00:11:30]  news agencies so then when it rolls around and uh it's time for the nomination uh you got them  saying everything yeah all the bad stuff my other observation i was watching the uh the evening news  with uh i actually was checking out kitty kirk last night and uh these people on the floor their  stunt brain they're responsible for this whole thing right that's why they're there the delegates  the delegates the delegates are there to cast the votes that were set up during the primaries my 
[00:12:00]  observation the delegates are a bunch of alcoholics yeah that have no business being part of this  process every every time they go to the floor and talk to a delegate they're all hammered they're just i  don't know what they are they're on something yeah they've been going to hospitality suites for the  last three days and the dnc's been saying hey don't drink no please no well something's going on because  every time they go to the floor it's just a babbling idiot well all the special interest groups are in  town too and they're just plying them all with liquor and whatever else they can do and it's one big 
[00:12:30]  party oh i wish a hurricane would hit denver they're all in one place rough well oddly enough  it's almost impossible i understand but special interest groups all in one place oh oh  they're going from denver to minneapolis then too so that caravan is just headed a few hundred miles  yeehaw hop in your covered wagons let's see if this is the mccain ad that i uh we're taking notice of  today i'm a proud hillary clinton democrat hey i'm telling you this is not going to be the one man 
[00:13:00]  i need the one that everyone is playing where they're using uh hillary's words right against uh barack  obama i was very hurt her words they hurt me what do we got there sam a big head of stupid hair  uh we got one of the delegates crying on cnn we got that crying that's great yeah get a hold of  yourself baby baby stick your head in gravy i do respect the people that i when hillary said barack 
[00:13:30]  is the man or whatever you know her words were you heard a few boos like no man you know we're i was for  you yeah i'm not going to acknowledge this i i don't agree with this and everyone else just  drinking the cool like chugging down the kool-aid even though like literally a couple weeks ago they  were all for hillary yeah hillary's bashing obama and oh they're just lying all over the place it's  lies and then these people that just this one can't see the lies yeah i don't know 
[00:14:00]  all right which which player all right let's try this she had the experience and judgment to be  president oh my god she won millions of votes but isn't on his ticket why we're speaking the truth  on his plans you never hear the specifics on the resco scandal we still don't have a lot of answers  about senator obama on his attacks senator obama's campaign has become increasingly negative  the truth hurt and obama didn't like it 
[00:14:30]  i'm john mccain and i approve this message i hate that woman's voice terrible the truth hurt okay look  we got 20 people working for the show behind the scenes can you get me the effing commercial that  we're talking about you know the one we're talking about please please get the one that i'm talking  that was the one that what here's biden's comment oh biden well we can do that one but no it's the  one where she she says and and all obama did was make a good speech in 2000 that's the one i want 
[00:15:00]  to play for everybody today yeah because those clips are not that bad those things she's saying  those are just out of context whatever but the one they're using now she basically says what has he  done yeah she goes mccain has all this experience with foreign policy i believe it was foreign policy  and obama he made some speech in 2002 that's damaging these are like well you can  you could pick apart any any speech someone makes and get a little something something out of it that  you could use against somebody what does barack obama's running mate say about barack obama you 
[00:15:30]  were asked is he ready you said i think he can be ready but right now i don't believe he is the  presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training i think that i stand by the  statement and what does he say about john mccain i would be honored to run with or against john mccain  make you think the country better off oh i'm john mccain and i approve this message of course you do yes  john mccain and this message kicked ass don't these people know this tape recorder is running with the 
[00:16:00]  same thing dopes i hate the and i approve this message yeah i i would i'd rather hear something like  i'm john mccain and holy yes i can't believe he said that wow he said that do you believe it  i'm gonna play it again play it right how many ads can we buy in one day  so just uh that's my uh observation today though just nothing but liars they all lie 
[00:16:30]  well kevin from connecticut's asking why do the all of a sudden all the uh candidates have to say  they approve the message it's uh it's because there are a lot of um uh interest groups that put out  their own commercials these pack what is it the pack yeah yeah and they they put out these uh  commercials that sometimes they're just horrifically hostile and uh the candidates want to separate  themselves from those ads right so um obviously at the end of those you won't hear a i approve this 
[00:17:00]  message although they like those ads but they oh they love themselves from the fallout oh you know  they sit in a room and just go whoa that was a good one he dropped a c-bomb on hillary  hey let's go to our reporter on the scene it's striker in denver striker how are you how's the how's  the convention going please god bomb this city and give us some peace oh god why what's going on out  there bastard striker i'll tell you what here's the new one that's going on so we've got a little bit 
[00:17:30]  of racism going on out here uh really the uh all the uh teens and the 20 something uh in the african  american community and we've got a lot of ethiopians and somalis out here too are running around with  their obama oh a t-shirt in denver oh yeah not like an eskimo moving to ecuador  why would a somali move to denver wow oh would they move to uh minnesota a little skinny chest

[00:18:30]  of start backfiring i think you're uh it's happening in that hey hope i know you're a fan of rage aren't  you rage against machine no just rage oh just being enraged that was a real question because i i am a  fan of rage it's addicting yes i love i love when i rage it's also contagious it is yeah someone else  is mad you're just like yeah i am a fan of rage i got a two thousand plus what was the exact total  like close to twenty three hundred dollar bill for breaking some equipment the other day is that was 
[00:19:00]  that twenty three hundred that's that's the corporate price that's why i'm going to best buy  and i'm buying my own cd player that's why these companies it's like the united states government and  the um you know the legendary uh fifty thousand dollar toilet seat or whatever it is yeah why  don't these companies do a little shopping around and and find a a cd player that isn't twenty five  hundred dollars yeah exactly christy go to a store and just buy one for for nothing well it's some kind  of like uh what what like yeah what exactly it's some kind of what what what are they trying to say 
[00:19:30]  professional grade professional grade take your professional grade and hey uh striker what about  rage against the machine anyhow they put on a free concert here yesterday for one of the protest groups  of course they did rumor has it the lead singer got there was encouraging protest of any and all  nature which i guess isn't going over which kind of irritated a few city leaders who actually 
[00:20:00]  supported the concert well when you when you invite rage against the machine to play what do you expect  yeah of course those guys are angry they certainly are they're angry millionaires yes let them have  their anger they see the machine and they rage against they're raging against it they're the way machine  they like to do they like to drive down rodeo with a shotgun right wow that's getting a little crazy  for me crazy yeah rodeo that's a great place to go and uh all right and i'll tell you one thing 
[00:20:30]  uh they're not gonna do what you tell them they'll just say f you i love rage against the machine but  it's kind of silly when you know how rich they are once you have rolled down you know some main street  and compton yeah trying to cause some problems i don't think they have any of that uh you know cuban  money yeah some of that fidel castro uh uh cash i don't think they're sporting that i think it's  american dollars in their bank account sure also i'm in uh angry i'm also in in camp chris cornell as 
[00:21:00]  far as that breakup went so oh yeah huge fan of chris cornell all right whatever uh striker thank you  striker goodbye striker here's the commercial we've been trying to play for the last 15 minutes we  finally got it it's 3 a.m and your children are safe and asleep who do you want answering the phone  uncertainty dangerous aggression rogue nations radicalism i know senator mccain has a lifetime 
[00:21:30]  of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002  hillary's right john mccain for president i'm john mccain and i approve this message  of course you do of course you do how let me ask you something she had to know they're too the  clintons are too politically smart to think that this stuff wouldn't be brought up there's no way  she could write this stuff and not think it would be brought up if it came to this she's too smart 
[00:22:00]  they're politically savvy they've been in the business many years she's saying all this stuff  because she didn't believe she was going to lose this thing she didn't think she was going to lose  this thing it's all you know it was she doesn't it was all or nothing for her well then if she didn't  think she was losing why praise mccain yeah because that's if she'd be going against him that's a really  good point so like i think jimmy's right it's it was a way to turn the screws on obama later on but  the mccain thing yeah you're you know what yeah i totally missed that one maybe that because she 
[00:22:30]  understood this is a way to hit him and try to get mccain elected somehow yeah so in four years she  could take another crack at it yeah you're exactly right they have a history of scorched earth policy  scorched earth they burn everything behind them yeah and it's all about going forward and what  the next thing happening is and look at the car bills in their lives who are who are advising  them on what to do in every next step and that's an exact plan that they probably had a safety door  ready to go yeah the 2012 she's back i'm here yeah because she her and mccain like each other it's 
[00:23:00]  like she i don't think she would have crap talked mccain other than maybe hitting him on some policy  issues but she's gonna yeah i think she really just doesn't like obama or she thinks he's kind of  stinks in in a perfect world man mccain wins this thing does one term and she has one more shot at  it she's probably more qualified as far as experience and she's probably tougher on foreign policy  than obama will be she's you can't like her lot i think there's no she's not likable no but i think  this loss makes her stronger as she moves forward let's be realistic but if barack wins and he gets  eight years then she's screwed because she's gonna be too old be realistic here obama is in the 
[00:23:30]  position he's in right now because of his charisma uh and yeah he gave a great keynote speech uh  2002 i remember that uh i had no idea who this guy was no one did no one knew they couldn't say  his name for friggin six months and i went wow this guy could speak yeah that's all i was thinking  like wow he really fired up the democrats and everything and that put him in the spotlight 
[00:24:00]  like or it would put a rock star in the spotlight no one knows what this guy does no one knows his  policies they're starting to a little bit now that he's uh the nominee finally but for the most part  no one knows his policies no one knows where this guy stands on um a lot of these issues he says he's  going to solve i love when they get up there and we will have affordable health care for every american  how's that going to happen yeah how the hell is that going to happen in this economy oh they have 
[00:24:30]  all these great ideas they come out with with no way of implementing them rock star rock star and the  rock star uh speaks tonight yeah coming down from what the mountains mountain mount olympus they built  a friggin temple for him to to appear with columns and stuff looks like my living room  that's gonna be fun to watch yeah i'll be watching tonight 70 000 people right yeah 77 000 what what is  you two coming on after him yeah who do you think you are dane cook and then mccain announces his 
[00:25:00]  running mate tomorrow so yeah that'll be really good to see who you uh barack did exactly what we said  you don't you don't need those news stations we'll tell you how it is right here we said old white  guy yeah there you go he did biden yep see we're right on top of this we know and we throw in a few  dick jokes in between right that's what we do opie and anthony stay there opie and anthony 
[00:25:30]  hey good morning to everybody opie and anthony jim norton you listening yankee sucking  oof what was the score last night another trouncing by the uh red sox oh yeah red sox coming to town  and just kicking the yankees ass and i couldn't be happier and mets back in first that's right baby  six three over the phillies the amazons as i like to call the amazons of course the amazons

[00:27:00]  yeah the your local newspapers print up they let the voice of the people uh out there through their  letters to the editor and uh quite a few of them commenting on michelle obama and her speech that  she gave uh the other night um which uh i i guess got kudos from the democrats they love thinking uh that  whoever walks up there is doing a fantastic job and um some people not agreeing can i can i really 
[00:27:30]  uh quickly tell you something oh sure we're getting a look at what communism would be would be like  because you watch this convention every night like wow look our government can't do anything wrong  everyone's in agreement it's perfect everyone is applauding everything that's said there's no  opposition it's fantastic right after anyone gives a speech they go to the floor talk to some delegates  maybe talk to other politicians they're like that was a fantastic speech one of the but one of her 
[00:28:00]  best i believe one of her best and then you forget that it's uh this is so one-sided and then oh this  morning you got rudy giuliani and a few of the republicans going it was stupid stupid she's stupid  that was a joke she was unprepared that speech was like yeah full of lies he's like well it was better  than a hillary speech or you know that was good for us yeah but man when you watch at night it is like  it's a it's a peek at what communism would they can do no wrong yes anyway sorry anthony that's all  right the uh letters came in uh here's this one um michelle obama she claimed in her speech that she 
[00:28:30]  loves america and she did she made a point of saying that in her speech which if you can't point that out  as being rehearsed and written by someone else to try to counter the fact that she said it was the first  time she was ever proud of america when uh her hubby was you know uh led into the club i guess  uh so she said in her speech that she loves america she sure does love america now that her 
[00:29:00]  husband's worth just went up getting the nomination michelle loves america as much as hillary loves  barack i'm surprised michelle didn't get choked up reading that lie off the teleprompter  that's from old bill green there in brooklyn hello bill hello bro not a big fan and uh who was  sitting next to barack obama when reverend jeremiah wright was giving his hate-filled racist  sermons it was michelle did she object to those sermons did she get up and leave because she was 
[00:29:30]  offended did michelle persuade her husband to leave or has she ever condemned wright's views the voters  want to know thank you larry trapani from queens but uh lots of these letters uh the same things  pretty much over and over people don't seem to like this woman it's not like or she's not likable  she's not likable like her husband no barack is uh he's got the charisma he's got he's smooth and he's 
[00:30:00]  like they've been saying he's a rock star but she doesn't have that same feel when you look at her  and she speaks let's be honest here barack is a crossover guy he uh appeals to white people  and appeals to black people that's how he does and people have said it before and been criticized but  he is the image of what i believe white people want as the first black president i don't think uh  white america is really ready for a hip-hop president uh you know i i don't think we want uh 
[00:30:30]  a gangster rapper in there it's this guy's a crossover it doesn't necessarily mean his wife is  uh which i don't think she is she's not very likable she comes off and her ideology from years ago comes  off as very um extreme you know and uh i think that comes out uh when she talks unrehearsed and barack  has been trying to keep her quiet which is fun to watch right when they're sitting on a little park 
[00:31:00]  bench giving a spin and she starts talking and the camera's on her he looks like don't say anything  stupid you tell me i'm almost in how many times have you seen them interviewed together where you  see barack like now hey now now she's gotta have goon arm marks on her arms legs goon leg marks where  he just squeezes a leg in that shut the f up motion you make a good point about the hip-hop thing  yeah because like anything new whenever you want to try something new you you don't go all in 
[00:31:30]  no you got to start slow a little slow at first you know what i mean like you want to talk your girl  into maybe a you know a little huh with the you don't go all in you start with the and then work  your way up to the you want a threesome you don't go hi this is michelle you know you ease into it  yeah you want to uh maybe have uh the girl uh stare at the pillow during some moments 
[00:32:00]  you you gotta watch it it's easy you gotta take it easy you don't just go smashing right through the  door let me go to brandon utah he's got a great observation brandon how are you buddy hey good  morning guys good morning hey it's uh it's funny watching uh cnn and then flipping it over to uh fox  and seeing the difference between the point of views they both have oh yeah well of course that  is funny fox is so ridiculous republican and cnn so ridiculous democrat it's just it's funny yeah 
[00:32:30]  there you go love you jimmy you gotta you gotta put the two networks to the well cable networks  together and then you you get a you know a better point of view you gotta go back and forth because  yes cnn was just like my goodness what a great convention the speech hillary gave getting raves by  everybody you turn a fox they're wearing clothes pins on their nose hey you she stinks yeah  right absolutely hey uh so barack made a surprise but i guess this is what you do every time 
[00:33:00]  yeah this is you get the photo op with the with the the ticket so biden's doing his thing and then  barack comes out or something like that i had to go to bed what time was this at one in the morning  what it was late because uh after clinton spoke longer than he was supposed to then carrie spoke and  then biden spoke and then uh biden's wife came out and then she said we have a surprise guest  meanwhile everyone there was a an armada of planes leading his plane into town and they covered the 
[00:33:30]  motorcade going to the convention center nobody was surprised no one surprised maybe the big surprise  was uh him kissing her on the mouth yeah he gave uh biden's wife a nice kiss biden's wife gets a kiss  on the mouth from barack yeah i got jungle fever yeah little kiss on the mouth so clinton talked for  how long he was supposed to talk for 10 minutes he talked for like 25 30 he's been known to he's got  his own go on that guy i love that guy because he's got his own rules carrie had to follow him that 
[00:34:00]  bore yeah herman munster went on after bill clinton last lily i'm voting obama lily  here's uh what do we got okay yeah barack coming out i think the convention's gone pretty well so far  what do you think cheap applause yeah yeah what do you think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well 
[00:34:30]  don't you think did she  he's like a host in a bad comedy club yeah come on give yourselves a round of applause for coming out  come on people this is all i got right hey billy burr if i'm not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house  last night  and when she walked in those thighs i think 
[00:35:00]  president bill clinton reminded us of what it's like when you've got a president who actually puts  people first thank you president clinton yeah whatever it's people first there's a few lies in  that uh speech there that was just a lousy run of things to say in a row even though they're all nice  it was just i don't think he should have said puts people first i should have he should have said  something like who puts people in front of him yeah on their knees yeah yeah might have been a 
[00:35:30]  little more accurate showed fat girls that you have value too yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah helping fat  americans feel good about themselves it's just so funny watching these two families who really do  want to strike oh they hate each other having to kiss each other's asses right oh how about a hand for  the white devils yeah and boy how about those right right give a big hand come on that's right 
[00:36:00]  barack slap me five side i really didn't think this was gonna be you know fun to watch on tv but  i'm enjoying the hell out of who doesn't see right through this out of it this transparent relationship  who doesn't see through it what happened to the fist bumping remember the obama's oh yeah you won't  see that no more i i guess that's gonna disappear unless maybe it's gonna come back tonight we'll see  it got a little uh i think it got a little too much bad press because it looked a little um i don't know 
[00:36:30]  a little too uh what it looked impersonal and stupid it looks silly like i like no one wants to see a  cute thing a couple does like if they locked pinkies and then wave their thumbs at each other  nobody wants to see that crap do that at home keep it for the house yeah you're running the country  hey was biden a fist bump in the eye when she gets lippy exactly biden was good he's always good he's  really a smooth speaker and he's very um very easy to understand he brings up very common language and 
[00:37:00]  he's happy he tripped up a lot though he does that yeah that's that's what they were saying he kind  of trips up on his words uh a few times he corrects himself so it's not like he just lets him yeah  blow by but he does kind of trip up a lot he too many liquid lunches you're thinking i don't know  well he's had a little uh aneurysm in the past hasn't yeah they had to cut his head open and then they  repair work putting doll hair hair in his head little barbie doll hair it's funny you mention that 
[00:37:30]  because i i heard that obama made a deal with uh mr biden really yes for every vote they get  uh mr biden gets another hair plug so one strand one strand per vote wow that they get  well stunt brain laughed a little he should have a a hell of a head of hair stunt brain would like  that deal right i would love it hey uh remember when i said that these uh people on the floor they're a  little uh huh gay with the delegates oh drunk there's something going on with these people 
[00:38:00]  and they were the ones that uh are responsible for what we're seeing on tv right yeah this is one  of uh one of the delegates on the floor yesterday will you cast that vote for him in november will  you cast your vote for because a little controversy because the hillary supporters don't want to you  know cast a vote for uh obama now right they still want to you know support hillary no matter what even  though hillary said please vote for obama i'm gonna vote for she's out of it it was a bit of  controversy so they went to the floor to ask some of these delegates rock obama in november or will you 
[00:38:30]  vote for mccain or will you not vote at all i will not vote for mccain i will not vote for mccain  but for the first time since i was 18 and that's been a long time  i may be faced with something i don't want to have to deal with i've never not vote i am one of the  strongest democrats i know i call up all my family and say call you need to get out the house i don't  care how much rain is pouring down i don't care what's going on in your schedule you need to vote  and for the first time i'm faced with not being a person who calls them and say go vote they may 
[00:39:00]  have to call me and tell me and remind me of how hard and how long we strive to get to the right to  vote the right to be here experience count i don't care what anybody told you and his resume is just  let's go okay and price mills thank you so much for why cut her off appreciate it obviously a very  emotional uh delegate let her bat blubber at this point whether or not she's going to vote in 
[00:39:30]  november a very difficult decision for her who was she was just a person or democrat she was a  hillary supporter she's a delegate on the floor yeah hillary she wanted hillary hillary didn't get in  so she's doesn't think she could vote for barack she's not going to vote at all cry baby i'd have  chased her around with that microphone what say more blubber into the mic you lunatic you cult of  personality nut oh enough i might have to have them call me yeah we're gonna move on to other things

[00:58:00]  and a gentleman was also there and came over and started uh doing stuff ah put it this way he was  taking care of business but at the same time could have completely been dressed and been juggling so it  doesn't matter he was using a certain part of his body what we got it thank you um and it looked like

[01:00:00]  you want to set this up there anthony see this is definitely worth another play i'm still pondering  what up set what up i'm still pondering the self-destructiveness you're multi uh multitasking  yeah sometimes yeah i do that sometimes how about all the time you're multitasking no yes anyway top  gun huh no top top we were discussing top gun yesterday over on the other side when you 
[01:00:30]  originally saw it you thought this would be a great like um what cool uh action uh just a fighter jet  a guy's movie guy movie not in the way that it's turning out to be when it came out you know the  music starts up danger zone the sun's rising over the uh uh deck of the carrier and uh they're doing a  flight ops and planes are taking off just look like a cool movie yeah and then it just turned 
[01:01:00]  completely gay and uh glamorous life on melrose place oh really oh what's that about i don't know  but it it turned like hokey and uh got a little homoerotic and uh it wasn't quite the uh you know  the movie uh i was hoping it would be the volleyball scene everyone had to be topless except for uh there  were some good scenes except for anthony edwards because he has a third nip or something i don't  know what's going on with the only one that was wearing a shirt i guess his body wasn't up to par 
[01:01:30]  for that scene or what's going on with anthony edwards that he had to keep on you know why he  probably didn't have the abs that the other guys had yeah and uh he doesn't have the self-control that  the rest of the guys had yeah so uh couldn't make those slow motion volleyball poses yeah so danny found  quentin tarantino talking about top gun and it's just brilliant he finally is saying what everyone  is thinking about this movie and uh here it is just a wonderful speech you know what one of the

[01:07:00]  scared to death brought a 45 i couldn't hit anything with it like literally that stupid paper cutout was  where that clock was i'm literally shooting i'm seeing water spraying up like 200 yards beyond the  target but uh i'll tell you for the beginner man the 12 gauge oh yeah you can't miss with that thing  that is a fun little weapon isn't it yeah great kablam yeah i just bought a new uh 45  bought a new uh colt custom it's uh what did you get the 2008 i want yeah that's good i walked 
[01:07:30]  i walked in there and i just asked the guy i said i want something shiny and loud that's that's what  i'm down to with guns now like i got the ones i want that i've always wanted for their um accuracy  shooting how it feels in your hand now i just want ones that are like yeah this is like the one um  vince vega had in pulp fiction could i have that one that's hilarious i just want you know shiny gun  how many guns do you have to buy in there to get like the free big lebowski sniper shades

[01:09:00]  the gun what did you do in your past that you're this paranoid you're a nice guy anthony i just i don't  know why but i i think it's because i watch the news i see that the county i live in is uh home  invasion capital of of the country apparently so i'm not going to be the guy i'm not going to be  that guy that gets the home invasion and and sits there because you know every single one of those  bastards are sitting on the floor getting pummeled going i wish i had a gun there isn't one of those  guys that aren't wishing for a gun it's not like i wish this gentleman had been more educated when he 
[01:09:30]  was growing up and perhaps had two parents in the house and taught him values it's it's like i wish  i had a gun it gets very primal at that point as much as we all think you're insane that that is a  very good point it's just a valid i got i gotta know perhaps i am a bit extreme i've come the other  way yeah i think everybody should have a gun i don't think it's good that only the government and  the bad guys have guns it's not good exactly that's what the second amendment's for just we we people 
[01:10:00]  should have guns i actually went fishing for the first time like i want to learn how to hunt and  that stuff so i finally went wow what's going on with you because i i've just read too much  conspiracy theory and i'm realizing i want to have the option that if stuff goes down survival my  i can disappear into the mountains gonna go into big bear i like the way billy's thinking now  no i just really like i i don't know how to hunt i don't know how to fish i can't start a fire  without a match i'm screwed whatever they say we are putting microchips in the back of your head  i don't want to do that you want oatmeal okay you're screwed i want to be like those rednecks 
[01:10:30]  you go into the woods you're in that two minutes you choke out a yak you got them on a spit you know  what i mean you want to hunt your own food yeah i want to i want to know how to do it like if i if  any point if i'm in that avenge me moment yeah avenge me i'm in that moment i can somehow scale the fence  and disappear and actually survive yeah get out i'm a big fan of the guys that fish right here in  manhattan in the river oh are you oh my the east and the hudson river they are fishing for their 
[01:11:00]  supper in the in this in this city wonderful what are they catching in the hudson river and the and  the east river squeeze those fish out and fill thermometers that's a horrible place to fish  that's a good sign of the economy yeah people in manhattan are fishing fishing in the rivers i have  noticed because i i take the bike path that more people are fishing so you might be onto something  diddy's flying commercial come on how bad are things yeah that's sad for diddy grounded his jet 
[01:11:30]  why because he said fuel is too much so now he's got to fly first class oh yeah poor diddy dude i dug a  little deeper in the conspiracy theory on what uh i i i don't know i'm afraid to say it on air  wow that big yeah i think i found i found you know four in the morning on youtube i thought i got  some illuminati kind of stuff yeah what do you got so cool i don't know i just read all this stuff  on the rothschild's family and like how they the candy manufacturers i know exactly yeah no i don't 
[01:12:00]  know i don't want to talk about it i got like wow reading it really freaked out reading it yeah  you're gonna have to you're gonna have to let me in on some of this i love i love jp morgan look like a  punk like they worked for him no i mean really worked for them or something i was just like oh  my god well now you got to give us something because you piqued everyone's interest there  well the rest of it is on my website and i'm kidding  well they're an international banking family is that true well on the outside  what do you got on them bill come on i don't know it's like kind of like brand new i just i don't 
[01:12:30]  know i was just reading it it's just they kind of back what if there's a war they kind of back  both sides oh and uh they're yeah profiteer yeah and they're never on tv for some reason  whenever they talk about the richest people on the planet they're like bill gates has four million  dollars they got him on a jet ski you know you're like that son of a bitch let's get four million  these guys yeah one of them died and on that deathbed and they were like how much money do you  have and he's like there's not enough there's not enough zeros for me to even and he was just 
[01:13:00]  literally like all the empires that have fell roman all the way back to the mongolians where we have  all that money wow but the thing is who did he say that to who was close exactly i have no idea who  would blab it and get it on youtube dude but you know what's funny about right before i learned that  information two seconds before that i was watching somebody get bit by a cobra you know i mean yes i'm  an idiot i don't know that's the beauty of the internet though come on no there's a great video on  there i think it's literally called dumb ass gets bit by cobra so the the how like intense it is 
[01:13:30]  because you know he's going to get bit yeah yeah the anticipation it's literally like the 11th strike  before he gets hit so by the time he finally gets bit like my knees were up in my chest like dude what  are you doing dude have you seen the piranhas ripping apart the uh the mouse yet no that's a good one  little white mouse is swimming swimming for his life in a tank he's doing strokes like his tank like  michael phelps back and forth oh he's trying oh he's rocking the swim but piranha just start 
[01:14:00]  nibbling at him a little and then they just start oh my god just disemboweling the mouse in the water  yeah i saw one of these guys caught a cobra and they put a rat in there and this rat did so well  like they should have let it live it was almost like you know survive three rounds with the champ  yeah you win some cigars this thing was literally every time i would go to strike him he would jump  up and over you could see the snake was getting tired and getting annoyed and then the people put it in  started tapping the glass they tipped the the oh yeah it was totally cheating yeah it was bogus 
[01:14:30]  oh that's not good you let the rat go at that point hey are you checking out the uh the political  process bill i can't the convention we're we're watching and we're just laughing our asses off  because there's just nothing but lies going on on tv oh it's brutal well once i saw hillary  clinton i just realized like that's why i couldn't vote for just hurt the way she talks  the next president well we've been doing the ak-ak with her for many many years a man who is  qualified to be the president of the united she turns into mars attacks uh alien 
[01:15:00]  she's horrid she picked a good pantsuit though you got to give it to her the orange one was  the right choice because there was a picture where they had a guy with five different pantsuits to  see which one would look good on set oh and she picked the good one the orange one she pulls it  up too high over her bunch she looks like oliver hardy  she's gonna bust a keaton movie uh she should come out in that fast motion like walking yeah 
[01:15:30]  a little ragtime piano  yeah it's uh we were uh watching the convention last night and it's just like i've said just a  bunch of liars they have say you know a biden and hillary just talking smack talking obama during the  uh the primaries when they were all hating each other oh yeah and and and jimmy brought up a good  point he goes don't these people realize there's tape that they they taped them doing this oh yeah to 
[01:16:00]  play it later biden is saying you know junkies yeah hey can i stay at your place and they're like  all right and then you go to work and they sell your tv i'll deal with that later when he comes  home i got my smack now you know uh they all do that you don't you remember uh george bush senior  when he's running against reagan he's like voodoo economics voodoo economics yeah and then like  two months later he's like this guy's great yeah it's good i like that voodoo economics i meant voodoo 
[01:16:30]  in a good way it's all just crap yeah it really is just crap yeah but it uh obama's uh definitely  got some momentum with this uh with this little party that they throw but uh the republicans get  their last ups they get to get their uh convention in when do they go to their convention in a week  when the hell is that stunt break oh next week next week uh but kane's announcing his vice president uh  tomorrow i think yes and uh who do you think that's going to be stunt brain you did so well 
[01:17:00]  picking um obama's uh vice president saying you could have been no way it's going to be joe biden  you could have been more off we said old white guy you went with a woman from the midwest yeah  with katherine sebelius i was wrong on that one but uh there are three candidates we're down to  mitt romney who would be the guy i would like to see in there with him but tom ridge the former  governor of pennsylvania who is would be key to combating the uh fight that biden's going to give  him in that uh critical state didn't ridge have a little controversy over something he's always they 
[01:17:30]  all have a little controversy and he is pro-choice so that's going to give all to the uh pro-life  well that might uh get in the way of the core but they're saying that could help lunatic battleground  states and there was uh talk of uh palenti this governor palenti who's a kind of a lukewarm guy  sounds too italian i uh no way i think it's going to be ridge i go uh mitt romney then i'm going  romney i like it to be romney i'm saying romney why don't they just have a cape why don't they 
[01:18:00]  have a bread farve yeah why don't they have these guys just fight it out in a cage match or something  a cage match make it fun what do you think of brett farve on the jets there uh bill i know you're a  huge uh pats fan but it's gonna be uh one way or the other he's either gonna have like the natural  season or it's gonna be joe nameth on the rams a lot of excitement here in new york yeah that's  what we're a lot of excitement here in new york but we think basically that he's gonna have two  okay years for the jets and then he goes back to green bay as a hero and goes into the hall of fame 
[01:18:30]  as a packer we've seen this play out so many times over the years with yeah because he had that great  last season but the previous three were pretty rocky they weren't that great right yeah he was uh  throwing like what's up with brady he hasn't really uh practiced or anything he's still uh  nursing that uh that ankle of his that they are trying to say isn't a problem dude i can't even  watch like i only watch the game so i don't watch any the pregame just because every sports show is  turned into two guys screaming at each other you know what i mean and they always have opposite 
[01:19:00]  opinions and it's always like so ridiculous i can't i can't i can't watch it it's just become  you know i don't know i don't think it's i think his ankle's a little slow swollen how could you say  that this is a guy he's got three rings he's got too much to lose they just start it's like really  you can bring up water polo they're flipping out the chlorine balance was off in the pool  how do you play with the ph like that it's and they get their i literally think they had pti came on 
[01:19:30]  and those guys had a natural friendship and a natural organic arguing and then they were like  people like this they're watching this go for just fight everybody yell everybody yell at each  other so i can't oh yeah i can't watch it they don't agree that would be kind of fun though  i think uh i think the jets got it locked yeah me too good point next nothing i'm gonna have to  agree with you on that one jimmy 28 more minutes commercial uh you uh you watch did you watch the 
[01:20:00]  olympics oh yeah i was totally into it yeah right i thought you know what's hilarious was the opening  ceremony it was like the classic white guy statement they were like you know when they  came out they were playing those drums and they were going nuts and everything and they were kind  of yelling it was it was awesome got you all amped up for the games and then uh i felt like i was at a  guitar concert but uh well they they literally were going like uh you know all the guitar fans out  there that's pretty good actually i kind of blew by that i don't even know what it's okay it's new  age he's the master of new age and uh all right anyway uh let me try to get the momentum going 
[01:20:30]  here again someone out there's gonna go i got it oh yeah but he literally goes like uh you know  because they're sitting there slamming the drums and yelling and stuff and he literally goes uh you  know an amazing uh performance here for the opening of the games and i gotta admit uh a little bit  intimidating i'm like that is just the classic i'm in another country i'm used to being around all  white people and now these guys are getting excited the natives are getting restless that's like that  british you know with the safari hat yeah you know i really want to blame you for that one because 
[01:21:00]  you kind of stopped the momentum in the beginning but i think that i'm sorry i'm actually as even  though you're kidding i'm actually like thinking like well i'm actually thinking about your point  and it's actually not a bad point i think every time you see video of non-whites with drums the  guys is being cooked alive so exactly yeah it's the uh shaka zulu moment i do shaka zulu i have to  explain something else there is a distraction going on i blew it with the guitar absolutely i'll take full  credit but also the phones are ridiculous they're all lit going nuts and the instant feedback 
[01:21:30]  is is flying by at this point you can't even read them because uh xm went down so people are  freaking the f out yeah apparently uh so that and that's what i saw so as i was trying to listen to  you then i'm seeing what the hell's going on you know are we still on the air anywhere but i guess  we are on the regular radio but not on the satellite so i do apologize to you no it's all right you want  to take a quick break we'll regroup and we'll continue okay bill burr is going to be at the stress  factory new brunswick new jersey friday saturday and sunday saturday sunday you sell out those

[01:32:30]  you know they're not having fun lesbian sex or anything they're just they're really just in  love with each other they have been for years is that del's lady with the daughter she looks like  like uh ralph cramden with glasses i'm not i'm not i'm not yeah that was uh what's her name phyllis  phyllis lion phyllis was awful yeah phyllis was and then the other one i thought that was uh billy jean  king oh phyllis is terrible yeah well we lost out we always goofed though that the uh in the old 
[01:33:00]  days when they had to hide it um like the the the media and just people newsreels they just never  understood gays right so they would just be like and these two ladies are quite the lookers yes gentlemen  any gentlemen callers for these two they're always out together so they'll need two gentlemen to take  them out not understanding they don't want guys they just didn't want to acknowledge it like that 
[01:33:30]  and there was the old gay couple the guys it's like hey ladies these men aren't taken  they're like frolicking in a pool with a beach ball gus and elmo gus and elmo elmer elmer that was  the name is gus and elmer yeah yes they're fresh back from the wall and looking for action  are they you know it's funny back then every guy who was in shape like they had no muscles they just  had that i'm in seventh grade torso you notice that like being in shape back in the day just meant you 
[01:34:00]  weren't fat right because you could be barrel like barrel like or something if you watch like ben  her and all of them yeah they have just these straight arms there's no tricep or bite it's like  skin hanging on the bone but they're not they're not fat they all weigh like 140 pounds yeah they  just you just thrust your chest out it was like yeah watching like uh tony curtis and spoticus  it's like i'm a gladiator my name's spoticus and and and he just he looked like crap and then 
[01:34:30]  nowadays you turn on the 300 and go jesus christ how do you get a body like that it's a whole group  of guys i did nothing but abs ben's ben stiller is shredded in comedy he jumps in the pool he's got  an eight pack i'm like really ben stiller comedy he was shredded i'm like oh my god i gotta go to  the gym tropic thunder is shredded judah ben her with a big barrel chest and a gut i'm in great shape  are you chuck yeah as long as your chest was out further than yeah and they'd suck their gut in 
[01:35:00]  when they take their shirt off they'd suck it in and it would just look horrible weissmiller the  guy who played tarzan tarzan yeah his little leaf shorts pulled up beyond his navel remember that  and he would be sucking it in the first guy who played batman remember him yeah utility belt cranked  oh yeah adam west yeah and the uh stretchy material was all stretched you can see how doughy his stomach  was yeah really have come uh leaps and bounds from those days yeah no no core strength now it 
[01:35:30]  doesn't matter what you're doing everybody's going to be shredded in the movies and tv you should see  the way like people work out in la i'm telling you like if you want like the next big money making  thing get into like hip replacements and knee replacements really they're doing that that that  muscle confusion you confuse it man it doesn't have times it doesn't have well basically if they say  if you do the same workout after a couple two three weeks your body gets used to it and it  becomes part and you stop getting results so what you do is you confuse it is you just perpetually 
[01:36:00]  have it so yeah i don't know just constantly doing these different exercises i was literally on the  treadmill i'm doing all the old school stuff i felt like i should have been wearing like the uh  the gray pullover sweatshirt you know like jack lalane doing calisthenics yeah and this dude is  literally this is i swear to god this is what he's doing he would jump up grab the chin up bar he'd do a pull up  then he come down he does one jumping jack drops down into the squat and then goes into like a  push-up and like spread his legs jumped up and then then brought him back together oh his muscles 
[01:36:30]  didn't know what was going on did a push-up and then went back and he did like a set of 30 of those  and i'm like shoulders knee oh that's good and the whole time he's jumping up and landing back down  the best thing too is he was completely out of shape oh so he just probably watched like that p90x  video have you seen that guy where they have all those 40 year old weird looking guys who are  shredded and they've lost the elasticity so it still doesn't look good  dude pat's 48 it's like dude keep your shirt on just keep your shirt on just as long as it's  straight you know what i mean you'll look fine oh my god that's the confusing muscles i don't think 
[01:37:00]  the muscles can really be confused they swear by that crap do they yeah i do the elliptical every day  or most days but it's like if you jog every day you still lose weight of course you do go out and  jog every day what do you what do you jog sideways and then jog on your hands run yeah that's all you  need to do i i know eating like a pig if you're working out and eating right it doesn't matter if 
[01:37:30]  your muscles are dazed and confused you'll be fine you'll work there's no money in that no no you got  to have some trainer that's going to tell you you got it you got to mix up the muscle first of all  don't let your muscles hear this yeah we're gonna confuse them what after the work you have a  homosexual encounter you confuse your ass muscles what's happening confuse your family  your throat is nervous he's never done this to me before it tastes funny

[01:45:00]  jason slagle  what a dope this guy is huh 33 year old jason slagle pulled a knife during an argument with another man  on tuesday night told the other people in the room that they were not allowed to leave  eventually slagle got thirsty sent two of those hostages for beer who then called police and they  came to the rescue did he really hold five people hostage with a knife that's pretty stupid i'm not 
[01:45:30]  a tough guy but just five of us and you have a knife you're in trouble we're gonna give it a shot  right yeah yeah and i'm not the guy who has like the knife on me right right right yeah that's when  you give him the lawrence taylor blindside to the back cause him to fumble what a bad hostage taker  go get me some beer and you better come back or i'll what cut one of us  it's good to know we have xm listeners that we can't go to the phones because they're all calling  to say we're not on the air right is that what they're all calling about can we get the word out 
[01:46:00]  through the pad data like they know stop calling they're working on it because i brought up the  rothschilds do you know what's that i brought them out cut to all the communications i tried to tell  you i only wanted to talk to you during break they're behind the merger man i'm telling you  all right we're gonna break illuminati stuff yeah that's scary that's all i think about now is the  illuminati just think that they're running things and and this is all a facade everything else the 
[01:46:30]  government everything's a big facade just to keep everybody it's like the matrix yeah yeah we're  all looking at pictures of britney spears vagina yeah we have no idea of anything else nothing else  we're captivated by that they throw distractions at us at perfect times oh yeah yeah first i came in  here did you see the new met stadium yeah see hey rothschild but didn't wouldn't would they allow  the internet to actually now they're starting to be revealed all this talk the books about the 
[01:47:00]  illuminati would they allow all this if they were so good no they're shutting it down uh to to on  2012 they're coming out with like the internet too and it's basically going to be like glorified  basic cable you're gonna have to seriously you have to pay for extra uh extra i don't know websites  they'll be like how is that gonna work is this true yeah it's being talked about yeah oh it isn't  being talked about it's actually a law it's gonna be happening i think that's how the hell can that  happen yeah they put if you get a new passport there's a little microchip in it  now yeah they're gonna basically they're starting with dogs they're putting in dogs 
[01:47:30]  yeah and they're gonna be like so unattractive women have a passport yeah exactly microchip so  they put they're gonna start with the dogs you know what if fido gets lost they'll have a couple  of those stories on tv and then they were able to find him and the dog was okay and everybody excited  then they'll start a panic about your kids getting abducted so they give them some sort of wristband to  wear and then eventually they'll they'll slowly it's already there's a commercial it's already in  their shoes you see the commercial on television yeah you can put the mother is in a park and she 
[01:48:00]  starts to panic and she's like saying her kid's name kevin kevin or something and she pulls this  thing out of her purse it's going beep beep like in aliens when they're looking for the aliens and  it's beeping and she sees a little dot and she follows it and there's her son uh because he's got some  kind of chip on him she can find it and then it was for duracell batteries because you know she only  depends on duracell yeah they find her kids slowly gradually getting it's like cloning they're not  just gonna clone a guy hey we got another dick cheney this one's got a good heart huh it's gonna freak 
[01:48:30]  everybody out they start small they start with like a goat or a squirrel oh it's adorable and they'll  gradually work their way up so they eventually probably by the end of my lifetime it'll be mandatory  every baby that is owned right between their eyes they're gonna have this big chip  and all your information is going to be on it and that way then they got you if you mess with  the deal they just they just turn your chip off wow you hear about andy they turned his chip off  turned his chip off then you're out in the street wow bathrobe with all your pistols chipless 
[01:49:00]  and that's why you're fishing and learning how to hunt that's how they're doing yeah they're not  gonna get you not getting me i caught a striped bass i know what i'm doing what's this charge  for internet thing that bugs me i won't like that at all who's gonna do it well the thing you know  what i love about all this stuff is no we don't get to vote on any of it we don't get to yeah any of  and all they just come up with these laws oh yeah by the way who's complaining about the internet right  now i'm not i love it no it's great i like having everything available well you can kiss that goodbye 
[01:49:30]  in a couple years sir they can't tax it they're not making any money off it they lose these these  scumbags they're losing money on the phone bill or all these other ways that people are  communicating because the emails are losing postage because people are not just mailing  letters anymore no but no the big thing is you lose control of people like you have to be able  to control the information that they see that way the lie matches up with the information and you're  able to continue on but if people can kind of bounce around then you get all these other guys like info  war guys like them saying all that stuff like hey here's another side of the argument so what they 
[01:50:00]  you know they'll gradually funnel it in too much information is being made available to people  which informs them and an informed people is dangerous to any government some old white guy  sitting in a castle right now there's too much information i think let out over there with  you must crush it grandfather rothschild just swimming in gold what do you do with all that money i think 
[01:50:30]  they just roll around like those coins putting it under their armpits oh it's cold yeah he's actually  sir theodore rothschild people are talking about us let's lock up the internet theodore  i think we got to step aside for a few minutes bill bar stress factory new brunswick new jersey  friday saturday and sunday opian anthony

[02:03:00]  she's got zero body fat she's like just into you could tell she just works out all the time  for some reason you know when a girl gets fake breasts and they have that that up that really  bad blue vein that's on the side like the whole body looks like that yeah she looks like one big  fake titty and it's and a lot of uh a lot of uh ligaments are showing in her like you could see  every every joint she just got like ligaments showing through because she's got no body fat 
[02:03:30]  she's phenomenally unbelievable shape but yeah but like a thoroughbreds in shape you know it's like  she looks like a like uh the dog the boxer you ever seen like that boxer's legs she has like  she has like pit bull legs i like her back in the old days when she had a little uh a little  soft a little softness to her little chub just you know shooting star uh ambition right up to yeah  yeah yeah before she got those um cone breasts you know before she went with the uh the cones on her 
[02:04:00]  breast thing i don't mind the in shape thing like i don't mind like yeah they get set like we'll be  saying earlier with guys it's like once you get past a certain age you know put a shirt on yeah you  know you look in shape with the shirt you're in great shape for your age but it yeah you know  danny wants to see a naked 50 year old danny opened a picture of her a minute ago she looked like the  machinist she just looks like she's terrible it really i don't mind ligaments but she really looks  bad it almost looks like she has like uh bicep implants or something or shoulder implants 
[02:04:30]  how do you get your shoulders like that you know what it is yeah you have your private chef  like look at her biceps though there's there they're hanging over her elbow yeah in shape that  one is nah that's uh shredded ethiopian that's yeah that's the look she's going for her name should  be like doc pole i knew that holy jesus wow  it's so cold in the day yeah so code in the day i'm very rarely embarrassed after a joke is so bad 
[02:05:00]  that was really bad i knew what i was trying to say yeah something funny  that really was dead center tree no airbag sneaker laying in the road  not a hint of a skid mark  that was a monumental car overturned with the wheel still spinning  oh the engine's still on here 
[02:05:30]  dead center tree you're right no airbag no break marks  no seat belt no seat belt just a bottle of whiskey and i'm gunning it  suicide by joke that was terrible i gotta wrap up this side but uh well barack uh does his big  speech tonight bill tonight yeah and he's gonna look like he's coming down from the mountain right  why is that what that set is it's a set he's got a set it's it's this columns and well they went 
[02:06:00]  to greece and they got some ruins it looks like yeah they brought some ruins back they brought some  ruins uh to denver it does look like speech tonight it's a little pompous if you ask me to  come out looking like you know apollo uh it's not a good look no it doesn't you should have like  those one of those those leaf things like mercury yeah yeah around his head some grape leaves or  whatever the hell it is and wearing sandals what do you think mccain's gonna come out  come out of a bamboo cage just underwater just comes out of rats rats smuggle there's no knife in his teeth 
[02:06:30]  if i can survive that i can survive the presidency i think he should just come out of a mud wall  behind like everyone thinks he's not there he opens his eyes they're like what is that and it's john  mccain walking out of a mud wall i didn't even see him  saying it's the white house yeah what you look at this it's a little presumptuous oh they're trying  to make it look like the white house are they like a room yeah it looks like a Greek ruins it looks 
[02:07:00]  like he's trying to this is the common man he's coming out of of of the parthenon i mean stop it  is there anything funnier than watching all those politicians calling each other privileged and this  person is that he's an elitist yeah it's like really hillary bilderberg group that isn't a little elitist  elitist yeah she's like one of the biggest elitists uh on the face of the earth who's ever seen 
[02:07:30]  hillary on a flight on a commercial flight to la she ever been sitting in front class no  hey there she is walking through the airport toting her bag behind her yeah rolling her  luggage stop like the working man right the working man i like that how uh yeah when uh barack  announced biden as his vice president um how they came out on stage with their uh jackets off  and their sleeves were rolled up like they're ready to get to work to go to work are you go yeah  what kind of dirty work are they doing all right let's dig some trenches we're gonna do some plumbing 
[02:08:00]  today there's no work that they're doing that they need to uh roll their shirt sleeves up except  for taking all the art off the walls of the white house and hanging up the posters from good times  a bunch of you're saying there's gonna be jj art on the walls those weird paintings that jj did  oh i love those ones the guy dunking the ball in his arms like three miles long yeah good stuff i just  picked yeah if barack gets in there i just picture a different kind of white house like i've done a lot of 
[02:08:30]  jobs uh when i was uh uh robbing houses known a lot of jobs when i was doing air conditioning work i  was in a lot of people's houses and uh a lot of different races and i've noticed different things  that are in common and a lot of african american families have african art in the house that's what  i've noticed and i could just see a lot of african art on the walls of the white house probably for the  first time not probably definitely for the first time ever taking down some of the old 
[02:09:00]  paintings of maybe taft one of those war masks put up a war yeah a lot of masks things like that  bill he's very scared of the possibility of barack being the president not scared yeah you're scared  there's a whole another wall of white people behind that that's just that's just a front  yeah that's yeah the president that's just the illuminati's caroline in the city that's like  this sitcom they just write the whole thing they rehearse they rehearse they do their blocking on 
[02:09:30]  thursday and on friday they go out and they give the speech do a table read and then they  we need we need rewrites that's your one-man show man that's great bill burr i'm paranoid  i would love that it's good that's very funny man i've uh what scares me uh the most is his  vulnerability and what anything that happens to him might cause because god forbid something does 
[02:10:00]  happen like has happened to presidents in the past that were um for a lot of change very different uh  rock in the boat kind of a thing that doesn't usually bode well for a president because there are  people out there with uh suddenly trying to goad somebody into doing something would i ever do  that i'm just commenting on the fact that there are some psychopaths out there what radical thing  are any of them none of them are talking about getting out of iraq none of them talk but they're  just doing the usual we're gonna get health care well let me tell you something everybody's gonna  have donuts middle of the country uh really doesn't need much more of a reason than skin color 
[02:10:30]  to uh think that that's radical middle of the country upstate new york well that's what i mean  you get out of that too yeah the second you leave the city very easy to get the hell out of  well we gonna have to take care of this here but uh because of that uh and looking at what happens  when uh police uh beat uh black man or uh something happens he dies in custody and uh could you imagine  something like that happening to the president of the united states the first black president 
[02:11:00]  he'll be fine i think there will be uh unrest i say unrest is how i put it this is what you're  hoping for why would i hope for that because you're uh you have issues i don't have issues you do have  issues you have a gun collection you don't have you have issues i oh i just bought another one the  other day it's still uh at the store what is it it's a sig uh 223 oh i thought you were gonna tell  the same story you did uh a while ago oh no no it's brand remember that you you already said you 
[02:11:30]  bought a new i bought a colt yeah now you got another no now i bought another rifle rifle it's  uh yeah what video game uh was this one from this one wasn't from one i was in the gun store and i  looked at it and was just like oh wow hell boy i gotta take that oh he gotta get that he buys his  guns sigs are great according to the video games he's playing i have done that where i played a  video game and one of the guns are really cool so i go to the gun store and buy a real one  do you have a scarface grenade launcher one no i have one that kind of looks like it  uh but grenade launchers are frowned upon by um you know the law enforcement yeah law enforcement 
[02:12:00]  i'm hunting with a grenade launcher hey why can't i hunt with a grenade launcher so what going was  this again it's a sig uh 223 yeah it looks a lot like that that's uh that's the one it's got the  same optic it's um yeah that's the guy that's the that's right into your house the cali cartel  that is an attractive weapon i'll tell you that my friend like a desk and like a big leather chair

[02:13:00]  get old and boring you know that you think then what are you gonna do with this you gotta go to  the range what's the option he's gonna hunt the ultimate prey the ultimate prey i am uh stocking up  yes i am i am stockpiling because i do believe our second amendment rights are going to be  infringed upon further when the democrats get into office and you will see gun laws these stupid  assault weapon bans and things like this that are semantics are going to be put in place there's  going to be more limitations put on people's right to uh get pistols and i will not stand for it so
