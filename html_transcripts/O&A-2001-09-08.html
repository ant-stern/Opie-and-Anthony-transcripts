<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about a missing intern, Rachel, and the investigation into her disappearance.  The hosts detailed their unconventional hiring process and played sexually explicit audio recordings of conversations between Rachel and their program director, Rick, revealing highly suggestive and explicit comments from both parties.  This led to speculation and commentary from the hosts, ranging from amusement to disgust.

Comedian George Wallace and "Miss New Universe" (Candy Apples) then joined the show. The segment rapidly devolved into a chaotic exchange of vulgar jokes, sexual innuendo, racial humor, and insults targeting the hosts, guests, and their mothers.  Callers added to the sexually charged and offensive atmosphere.

Following this, the show continued with George Wallace as the main guest,  interwoven with increasingly offensive jokes from the hosts and callers.  "Stalker Patty," a 45-year-old virgin fan, entered the studio, leading to a prolonged and highly inappropriate exchange focused on her appearance, virginity, and body. The hosts and Wallace made sexually suggestive remarks about her, even examining her undergarments.  Patty gifted them baked goods and a beanie baby.

Comedian Adam Ferrara then joined the discussion, sharing anecdotes about his past experiences, including homemade weapons and paintball, highlighting injuries, debauchery, and pranks. A caller, a former teammate from the "Red Devils" paintball team, recounted their disastrous national competition performance following a night of heavy drinking.  Further paintball stories and technological advancements were discussed, with additional jokes and references to Stalker Patty.

The show transitioned into a segment featuring a rambling discussion about paintball, celebrities like Ricky Schroeder, Vietnam veterans, and newer paintball technology, before shifting to a discussion of ecstasy use.  Andrew "Dice" Clay called in, sharing sexually explicit stories about Jim Norton's behavior involving underage girls, prostitutes, and urination.  Norton subsequently called in, confirming and elaborating on these stories, detailing graphic sexual encounters and unusual fetishes.  Jim Cook, the Sam Adams brewer, then called to describe his embarrassing bicycle accident, resulting in broken ribs and a cracked hand; this led to further crude and offensive commentary.  The segment also briefly touched upon Arnold Schwarzenegger's alleged groping of a TV reporter and included a crude song about *Total Recall*.

Finally, the show featured Leah, an advice columnist from IGN4men.com, answering listeners' sexually explicit questions about relationships and sex.  Topics included hair removal, finding G-spots, sexual positions, unusual body odors, penis size, and bizarre sexual practices and fetishes.  Callers described unusual sexual situations, including a penis stuck in a junk drawer.  The hosts and a recurring fictional character, "Mike Tyson," frequently interjected with crude jokes and violent suggestions.  Leah concluded the segment by encouraging listeners to submit more questions to her website.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Now, the station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station, 1027 WNEW, New York, Opie and Anthony, 1027 WNEW.  Why are they searching Gary Connett's apartment two months too late?  Well, because he's not a suspect. 
[00:00:30]  You would have thought they would have, you know, tried to search it a little sooner than this.  People have to realize there has been no crime.  There's no crime here.  It's a missing person.  If they want to search his place, which he gave consent to do, I think the guy's innocent of anything.  Oh, my China, kid.  The guy gives me the creeps.  Yeah.  Yeah, this missing intern.  I wish a few of our own would go missing. 
[00:01:00]  But, yeah, the missing intern.  Wait, you have a problem with some of our interns, Ed?  No, you know me.  You know that we purposely don't have female interns on our show?  Why?  Well, we sacrifice for listeners so we can, you know, do our jobs.  We have one.  We have one.  That snuck through the cracks.  That's true.  That didn't go through the proper channels.  That was funny.  Very pretty girl.  Rachel.  Beautiful.  And Rick comes in one day and goes, hey, I want you to meet the new intern.  Now, usually when we have interns that are prospects for the show, they're brought into the office. 
[00:01:30]  We meet them.  And then they have a little interview with Rick and whoever.  They go through a whole process.  They have to talk to Rick and Ben.  Then they have to talk to Jeremy, the program director here, and Craig, the assistant.  There's a whole process.  And then after a while, if they cut the mustard there, they get brought in.  And it's like, hey, here's our new intern.  Right.  With Rachel, Rick brings her in and just goes, hey, here's our new intern.  Like there was no process of anything.  Nothing. 
[00:02:00]  And it was the first time we saw her.  It was the first time we saw her.  Right.  Hey, new intern.  Oh, what the hell is going on here?  And then we just go, okay.  We were happy but pissed at the same time.  Well, it's very distracting when there's, you know, hot women walking around when we're trying to broadcast.  That's all right.  See, we sacrifice.  Yeah.  We know we can't do our jobs if the women are around and they're looking all good and stuff.  Yeah.  Dan says they should search Gary Ackerman's office while they're at it. 
[00:02:30]  I just have a feeling.  That's true.  We get a lot of calls from Gary Ackerman, who's a congressman out on Long Island.  And he sounds very, very with it.  You know, he likes the show and everything.  And then we looked at a picture of him.  The guy is, he's an old guy.  He's no kid.  No, not at all.  But he's got a great sense of humor, I guess.  Very surprised that he listens to our show.  But yes, search the apartment.  What?  Rick?  Rachel.  What about our...  Rachel never went through... 
[00:03:00]  Our interns.  Rachel never went through the process.  Never went through the channels.  Why?  Why, Rick?  Why, Rick?  Let's listen to this load of crap.  Let's hear this.  We've been...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here is why.  Hold on.  We've been trying to get to the bottom of this for a long time, man.  Filthy whore.  Because you should see...  Here is why.  You should see what these poor interns have to go through just to work for free and get our stupid coffee.  It's kind of pathetic.  But this girl just marches in and she's great and all.  Get the hell off my obstacle.  That's like what the interns usually have to go through. 
[00:03:30]  Profit Pyle, you're a disgusting fat body.  She's great.  She belongs here and she's intelligent and all that.  But I just know she did not go through the process.  Actually, she did.  She went through the meetings.  But that day, you guys...  What meeting?  On the closed door?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Wrong try again.  Why is Stinky shaking his head and why is Ben shaking his head?  I remember going into air, too, to edit some bits or whatever. 
[00:04:00]  And you're in there talking to her by yourself.  And I go back to bed.  I'm like, how come Rick's in there talking to some girl?  Because you guys had the doors closed for something wrong.  Wrong.  I'm down to edit a piece.  Hold on.  Congressman Rick.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Congressman Rick.  Check his Miata. 
[00:04:30]  Here's the interview process for Rick.  I just want to ask one question.  Okay.  And I'm going to ask it to Ben, okay?  Ben, how many of the interns currently on staff were you involved in the interview process?  Everyone but Rachel.  Right.  Exactly.  You know that's true.  You know that's true.  But like I said, Craig...  And why do we ever meet her?  Craig finds me.  He says, hey, I've got that intern, blah, blah, blah, for the meeting today. 
[00:05:00]  I'm like, where are the other guys?  Oh, the door is closed.  Opi wanted the door closed.  Whatever.  I'm like, fine, send whoever it is down.  I've got to edit a bit.  No problem.  I'll just talk to them there.  Oh, because you were editing a bit.  So you figured you'd save time by editing the bit in the private studio while you conducted  the interview.  So when did you introduce her to Ben and Stinky?  I don't remember.  Maybe it was the same time we were introduced to her in the office.  No, I think you guys saw her.  What would happen, Rick, if you brought some guy that was going to be an intern into our 
[00:05:30]  office and just went, hey, this is the new intern?  We'd be like, what?  We never met him.  You guys met her afterwards, right?  Afterwards.  No, no, no.  Not when you guys got finished.  You guys met her after I spoke, was it right?  You met her that day after the door opened, right, on her way out?  I don't really.  I just remember going in there and seeing you in the studio by yourself.  There was a mic on during the interview process. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, really?  We have Rick.  Do I make you horny?  Yeah, baby.  Really?  I have some audio.  Oh, because the mic was on.  Here's Rick talking to the intern, right?  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  That is not what happened.  We have more?  All right, here's Rick in the interview process. 
[00:06:30]  Do you like having your background?  No, that didn't happen either.  Pussar!  No?  Shut up, stinky, you ass.  Here's the intern, Rachel, after the interview process.  All right.  You've got some funky tasting spots.  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Is it true?  Rick was second-guessing himself after she left?  This is legal, isn't it? 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  More of Rick.  Take your bra off and take it off now!  And here's the intern then leaving, Rachel leaving the office.  We're cakes for nothing!  Here's Rick to Rachel.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh, no. 
[00:07:30]  That's horrible.  That is not what happened.  It isn't?  No!  There was a reason why we couldn't...  I couldn't do the interview in the office with the guys.  It was because you guys were in there, and you're like,  all these interviews, we don't want to be a part of them.  Do you guys just deal with them?  All right.  We got some more Rick?  Yeah.  Oh, you're very naughty.  No, this is Rick.  We've got Bush.  We've got Bush. 
[00:08:00]  Is it true it was that time?  Because why else would Rick say this?  Bull to sink!  Bull to sink!  I don't know.  It was just a very normal intern.  Was that on in the background?  No, it was just...  Rachel, I'm pointing out something to Rick that's a little odd during the interview.  Your balls are showing.  It was your basic intern meeting. 
[00:08:30]  Can I touch it?  No!  All right, Rick.  Well, no.  We got audio.  Now we see it was just an innocent...  It doesn't really matter, you know, how we got her.  She's a good intern.  Yeah.  She's a great intern.  Very eager.  Oh!  It's in the hole!  All right. 
[00:09:00]  Well, Rick.  I see your legs come back.  Is it over yet?  Doug, what's up?  I heard during Rachel's interview, Rick says, you don't worry about doing the A, Bs, or Cs.  Just do the Ds.  Later, guys.  Hey, that's good.  That's a good callback right there.  It's actually the Cs.  Now, as a little contrast, we also have audio of Rick's interview with John, the intern.  Okay. 
[00:09:30]  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  See?  There's a little difference there.  Well, here's Rick with Rachel.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I'd bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Just don't talk that way with people that you want working for you.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  It's very inappropriate the way you were dressed when she first walked in.  Hello, cutie pie. 
[00:10:00]  Now we're having fun.  Yeah, we sure are.  If I said you had a beautiful body, would you take your pants off and dance around a little?  Here's Rachel.  How would you like to suck my ass?  You're close.  Give them to me.  Now.  Wow, this is going to be a great callback line.  Paul, what's up?  What's up?  Rick, did you offer a drink? 
[00:10:30]  You know, coffee, tea, or me?  Yes.  Nice.  Bravo to Paul.  Shut up.  Dick.  All right, great.  Why would you ask this, Rick?  I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boobies.  I don't know.  And when she was taken aback at some of your sexual advances, why'd you have to say this?  Well, we're waving.  My God, Rick. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  I don't know if Rachel's qualified for the job, Anthony.  Why?  I got a little audio of Rachel after, you know, Rick was through it.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  Did you hire her for her body?  Flaming Arrow checking in saying, please search Rick's apartment.  And Sheep Lover is saying that we shouldn't blame Rick because it was Max at the time. 
[00:11:30]  It was Rick's alter ego, Mad Max.  Even a better callback.  You douchebag.  All right.  Liz, what's up?  I'm so hung up on these girls over here.  Oh, the teen fake-os?  You have no idea.  On my way to work, I fully missed my exit.  I have to go home and change my pants because I am dripping.  She went through a puddle, I guess, and the water came in through the window, Opie, and  now she's wet.  It's happened. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, nice dress.  It's happened.  And between the girls on the radio and me in tandem, it's like a stereo over here for  anyone who's interested in listening.  Wow.  So I just wanted to say thanks.  Oh, we do have other intern openings coming up.  Yeah, Liz, would you like to intern with the Opie Anthony show?  I don't know.  We're open intern's openings.  I've heard the interviews are pretty tough.  I hope I can hack it.  Hell, let's be like Gary Condit and just wreck our careers.  Why not?  Let's just get hot interns. 
[00:12:30]  We'll get nothing done.  Don't get too attached.  We'll make you disappear.  All right, Liz.  Thanks.  Bye.  By the way, someone needs to say it.  That girl is not hot.  Who, that?  The missing intern.  They call her the hot intern.  The New York Post always says the attractive young intern.  Attractive young intern.  Well, the Post tags somebody with something and then just leaves it that way.  Like the other one, the girl, the flight attendant he was with, is the flame-haired stewardess.  Right.  And now she's just referred to as that.  The flame-haired stewardess.  She looks like Miranda from Sex and the City 20 years from now. 
[00:13:00]  Ah.  Look at me with a little Sex and the City line.  I know.  There'll be 20 things going, Sex and the City, fag.  Faggot.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  There you go.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:13:30]  Yes.  212-757-1027, Anthony.  Old Dirty, you've got to move down the couch.  Move over there.  Why is that?  Old Dirty can stay over here.  Yeah.  Dude.  Old Dirty over here.  Old Dirty over there?  Yeah.  He's got my back.  Antonio has spoken.  Look at George Wallace.  What's up?  What's up?  How y'all doing?  And we've got George Wallace and Candy Apples. 
[00:14:00]  Candy Apples coming in.  Wow, Candy, you're hot.  Is that platinum you've got on your neck, Miss?  It's gold.  It's gold.  Oh, that's white gold?  White gold.  Look at Old Dirty.  He's ready to grab that and run.  You want to wear it?  It says Miss New Universe.  I'll let you wear it.  Oh, it does?  Miss New Universe.  All right, we're getting Miss New Universe in the seat.  We've got George Wallace all hooked up.  I'm here, ready to go.  There's George.  Talking trash.  Let's do it.  Good morning.  Good afternoon.  How you doing, man?  This is Old Dirty.

[00:14:30]  She can start.  So I can talk into everybody's microphone.  Yeah, there's only one person that we want naked in this studio today.  You got that right, Bertie.  And that would be Old Dirty.  Well, you know that old joke, right?  You lay down.  We play the road game.  You lay down on our blacktop.  You know that joke?  You lay down and we're going to play Army.  You lay down and I'm going to allow you.  That's Pearl Harbor.  Hey.  That's Pearl Harbor.  Hey, Pearl Harbor.  Pearl Harbor.  Sure.  That's me.  You think we're in Hawaii, huh?  Yeah.  Why not? 
[00:15:00]  Right?  Why not?  I didn't know everybody was so handsome.  Really?  Where?  Where?  Me.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, talking about George, man.  As soon as she said that, you see how everyone looked at her and gave their best look?  I just started turning around.  The GQ.  Okay, we're all hot.  Wow, look at that.  Miss Universe saying we're hot.  Hell yeah.  Wait, this thing's too big.  It's too big for me.  Well, thank you very much.  That's what my girl said.  Somebody adjusted.  This is pretty weird.  We got Miss Universe and George Wallace in the studio at the same time.  What's up?  It's not fitting on your head. 
[00:15:30]  It's a pleasure to be here.  I'm just happy to be in New York.  Let me tell you something.  You want to be strapped in, tied up?  Strap me on.  I can do that.  I'm happy to be here today.  I'll tell you.  I don't know what to do with myself.  Yeah.  Hey, Candy, get naked.  Naked right now?  Yeah.  Believe you'll get naked.  Oh, God.  Oh, dirty.  Get naked.  Go get me a glass of water.  Is this the naked part?  Go get me a glass of water.  I've got to take my background.  Come on, believe it.  We can all have fun.  Get my background.  See, I should try honey gold weed.  Double D.  What do you got there?  That's honey gold weed, man.  Oh, you already took yours, huh?  Yeah, that's the poor man's.  What did you take the whole damn thing for? 
[00:16:00]  Didn't you save some for me?  Two capsules is all it takes, my man.  I see the table moving over there.  You see the rise?  He's watching.  You see the rise?  Old Dirty's been eating those like M&M's, man.  I swear to God.  I'm running out, too.  What's up, man?  Don't look you back up.  But now they're not free this time.  Now you've got to start paying.  Oh, wait a minute.  We got them all roped in.  Hey, Dirty, I got plenty of money.  We can buy as many as you like, okay?  I'm telling you, talk to me, somebody.  George, have you heard of the horny goat weed?  I did hear about that thing, too. 
[00:16:30]  I don't know if it was real, but it's real?  Yeah, it's like natural Viagra type thing.  You pop them and you're busted nuts.  Forget about it.  You're getting your F on.  It's Old Dirty.  Get your F on.  Get your freak on.  Oh, yeah.  Then you can have F-O-N fun.  There you go.  There you go.  F-O-N fun?  Yeah, that's how I spell fun.  You know, I went to night school.  Not that I had to go.  It's just that we live so far away.  Here, let me read you this book.  By the time I got there, it was dark.  You know what I mean?  Horny goat weed.  I don't need that sitting next to you.  I don't need that, Horny goat weed.  There you go.  Libido and sexual performance. 
[00:17:00]  In men and women.  How about that?  Four capsules.  Dietary supplements.  Why is Miss Universe still clothed?  How's your libido there, Miss Nude Universe?  She's got the bling bling on.  The bling bling.  Oh, lots of it.  A little ice.  Bling bling.  Look at Old Dirty.  What does your ice say, Miss Nude Universe?  Miss Nude Universe.  Is this the naked part?  Let me see.  Yeah, you're not naked yet, though.  You can do more than that.  You can do better.  See, George is even saying, yeah.  I mean, Old Dirty may not be old enough to do this, but you're old enough.  Yeah, he's old enough.  He's breathing. 
[00:17:30]  That's good.  He's breathing.  George, would you like to see Miss Nude Universe?  I have nothing to do.  I'm blind.  I can't see a thing, so you can get nude in front of me.  I can't see a thing.  I'm telling you right now.  I love my job.  Don't you love your job?  I have the best job in the world.  Look at you guys.  You guys are excited.  You guys are really pink.  You're red.  Are you ashamed of this?  No.  Are you kidding?  That was wonderful.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Look at me when you're talking to me.  Hey, thanks for having me, guys.  You're looking at me.

You get naked, and then what do they judge you on your body or something?  It's kind of an achievement award, and I've qualified.  I qualified.  How many people entered the contest?  Two.  How many people entered the contest?  I didn't say that.  He asked you there.  Yeah.  She's answering all two of us.  Yeah, but what year do you win this contest?  2000.  I got in October.

Oh, Dirty, are you usually this quiet?  Look at you.  You just got your mouth open, and you just looking.  Oh, Joyce, that's a good thing.  That's a good point you bring up.  This is the new, softer, gentler, old dirty.  He can't even talk.  He's looking at him.  He's looking at him.  Me, too.  I usually talk more, but, you know.  Yeah, well, you just thought something nice, right?  I'm just looking at the parade today.  Yeah.  Did you have to show the taco and everything?  The taco and the whole enchilada. 
[00:19:00]  Everything.  Everything.  Wow, and then you're judged on what?  Poise and moisture?  What are you judged on?  Moisture content.  You showed your taco.  I want to see your chalupa.  And what the hell is a chalupa?  Must be that chihuahua we don't see anymore, huh?  Yeah, it's in the taco now.  Okay, you are looking good.  I've got to look at you guys and talk to you guys, because my head keeps going like this.  I feel like the little dog in the back of the car, you know.  Hey, Jim, what's going on?  Yeah, dude, F Miss Ud, Miss Nude Universe, she sucks, yo. 
[00:19:30]  Who's this other guy that you have on with her, though?  This is me, George Wallace.  Yes.  Yes, sir, how you doing?  Yo, I've never heard you before.  You have me rolling on the floor right now.  Well, what the hell are you rolling on the floor?  Get your ass out.  People can say some stupid things, right?  A man told me now that my wife is going to die when I tell her I saw you.  Well, what the hell?  Don't tell her.  Just stupid stuff people do.  I'm at the airport.  A lady says to me, I'm standing waiting for my luggage.  She says, Mr. Wallace, you might have quiet today.  I said, well, hell, I'm standing there by myself. 
[00:20:00]  Why do people say stupid stuff?  I'm standing there talking to her.  Are you still rolling on the floor?  You need to get your ass up.  Hey, George has been around forever, Jim.  I've never heard of him, but dude, he had me rolling when you said he was going to work,  and then he goes, I might show up, I might not.  He's rolling.  I have to get you for work.  I have to listen and stay to him.  George, have you ever do the Johnny Carson thing?  I've done everything.  That's right.  I'm a mess.  I did Johnny Carson.  I've been on Oprah.  I've been on Oprah's show.  I've been on it all, you know? 
[00:20:30]  Ouch.  Well, just last week.  I've done every show just politically incorrect last week.  You didn't see me on that?  With Bill Maher?  No, he missed that one, unfortunately.  Yes, I do every show.  There is a Jay Leno, Tonight Show, HBO Special, you name it, I've been out there.  I do it.  I was even in one of the worst movies of the year.  I was with Lil' Nicky.  Really?  You were in Lil' Nicky, huh?  You mind your own business.  Don't be worried about it.  Adam Sandler's a good friend of mine, and I love him.  I'll do it again for him tomorrow.  Well, you know, he had quite a streak going there, so you've got to hit a little bump in  the road every so often. 
[00:21:00]  Sure.  What did you play in Lil' Nicky?  I was the mayor of the city of New York.  Really?  Yeah.  You go see Lil' Nicky.  Did you see it?  No, I didn't either.  I'm a big Adam Sandler fan, too.  That one just looked bad.  He's nice.  I'd do anything for Adam.  He's a great guy.  I rented Battlefield Earth before I...  Did you see Batman Forever?  Yeah.  I was in that.  What were you?  I was the mayor.  You were the mayor?  I was mayor of Gotham.  I don't have to lie to you people.  You ain't nobody.  You're right there. 
[00:21:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  He's absolutely right there.  And I just did a movie this year, a successful movie called Three Strikes.  Didn't you see all the advertising with me in Three Strikes?  You didn't know that was me, did you?  Three Strikes?  Oh, hell.  The people in Jersey know.  Wait, no, let's go to John.  John wants to say something to George Wallace.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, we're talking to George Wallace and Candy Apples.  Hey, George, is this George Wallace?  This is...  Hamburger?  Oh, no, that's a friend of mine that says hamburger.  People think that I do that, you know, but I am George Wallace.  I am the George Wallace you're thinking about. 
[00:22:00]  Yes, I am.  Wait, the governor of Alabama?  Yes, I'm the governor of Alabama.  The governor of Alabama.  I'm tired of pussy putting around.  I'm waving my confederate.  That is pretty odd that, you know, your name was George Wallace.  There's nine George Wallace's in my family, and I'm running for president of the United States.  Are you?  Better change the name.  People might get confused.  No, they love me up there.  Let me tell you, everybody in New York knows me.  Isn't it wonderful that President Clinton is going to go up there, though?  In Harlem?  In Harlem, yeah.  In 45th Street.  There's some good things about that.  Just think, all that stuff he had to take back, like the tables and the purses and things, 
[00:22:30]  they got all that up on the 125th Street.  He can get all that stuff up there.  He can take the top floor, Jesse Jackson can take the bottom floor, and they put family  services right in the middle there.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's going to be great for Clinton up in Harlem.  I'm telling you that right now.  He was saying yesterday that back in the 60s, he used to walk around Harlem, no problem.  Well, you know people say that.  But there's no problem if you go up there now.  There's more white people up there now than you could ever have.  No, Harlem has completely changed.  Changed, yes.  I think we all know that.  But in the 60s, he's claiming that he used to walk around.  Yeah, he said, you know, I used to get off the plane and go up to Harlem and just walk around.  People say, hey, what you doing here? 
[00:23:00]  I don't know.  That's pretty good, Bill.  I have my wallet back.  That's pretty good.  It is not that bad.  I'm not going to let you get away with that.  No, in the 60s, Bill.  Back in the 60s.  Speak up, old dirty.  I don't.  My man, the stage is yours, my brother.  You got to say that.  I just know you do a lot of talking about the day this lady is here, and you just got  all quiet on us and all like that.  I'm just looking for more.  All right, let's go to Jack.  See what Jack has to say.  Jack, what's up?  Hey, George.  Good morning.  You were the best years ago.  I remember you on, like, the Dean Martin roasts, all of that. 
[00:23:30]  Huh?  Were you on the Dean Martin roasts about 30 years ago?  Yeah, I don't know where the hell you come from.  That's Nipsey Russell.  That's Nipsey Russell.  With the glove on, the white glove, and the red glove.  That's George, uh, what's that man named?  George, uh.  George, uh.  No, Jefferson?  Not George.  That's Wheezes.  That was not him.  That was another guy.  Oh, man.  No, I'm George.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'm good, though.  You should say this.  I'm one of the newcomers.  Stop, man.  I'm sorry.  I thought you were a talented guy.  What's the guy?  Sorry.  He thought I was a talented guy.  Hey, Jack, he's not Nipsey Russell. 
[00:24:00]  No, that was a George guy that did what he was talking about with the gloves.  I can't think of him.  I can't think of the name, either.  Yeah, he was a good guy.  He was a good guy, too.  He died some year.  He was locked up for doing drugs in Las Vegas before he died a few years ago.  Hey, that's funny.  Yeah.  He was locked up for selling drugs.  Is that better?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Come on, come on.  George.  Yes, sir.  Did you used to do that bit with, that's the way I like it, you'd hold up the signs?  Yeah, I did.  That's the way I did.  Yeah.  That's a funny bit. 
[00:24:30]  Wow, there.  They went way back.  They got someone right.  And the bit, you know, I didn't do it.  I just told him that.  Oh, is that it?  I just don't take credit for it.  What the hell, man?  Well, I did so much stuff.  I'm so topical that it changes every year.  You know, right now I'm talking about just being here in New York, talking about things that just happened  last weekend, today, and Valentine's Day.  I'm topical, so I change every day.  You come to my show, it's always different.  What do you got on Valentine's Day, George?  I have absolutely nothing on Valentine's Day.  I just make up stuff.  And, you know, I make it sound good.  But I guarantee you, by this weekend, I'll have something.  You'll figure it out, right?  I mean, I just talk about things that happen in the city and things that happen. 
[00:25:00]  You know, you just lie.  All right.  What have you seen in the city since you've been walking around?  Well, it's just kind of stupid how the people drive.  Well, you want to talk about something stupid?  Yeah.  The way people drive.  Say, I'm from another part of the country.  We can make a right turn on red.  Right.  But you can't do that in New York City.  Right.  Because, you know, you can't let people make right turn on red.  You already got people going straight on red.  So I'm on the George Washington Bridge.  A man in front of me changed lanes from the upper level to the lower level.  That's a lane change.  And didn't even signal.  Well, these jokes sound, you know, they have to be out of the state. 
[00:25:30]  It's amazing that you hit me with jokes, and I do jokes all the time, and I can't even  think of a joke to do right now.  Isn't that amazing?  That's your job, man.  It is my job, isn't it?  Yeah.  How about a topical joke?  Well, a topical joke would be talking about people that need their ass kicked.  Ass kicked?  That's topical?  A lot of people need their ass kicked.  Yeah.  You ever go to a grocery store and somebody pay for a loaf of bread with a check holding  up the whole line?  Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.  They need their ass kicked.  Then we got to call the general manager over to approve the check, right?  Hell, I can approve $1.29 check.  Get the hell out of the way.  I think a lot of people need their ass kicked.  You ever go to somebody's house, the dog is sniffing your crotch, and they won't do nothing 
[00:26:00]  about it?  These people need their ass kicked.  The doctor, you ever go to the doctor, the doctor needs his ass kicked.  If you ever go to the doctor, you sit there for, you know, you got a 10 o'clock appointment,  you don't see him at 11.30, 11.45, then he comes in and says, what's the problem?  The problem, I've been waiting on your ass an hour.  The doctor needs, the weatherman needs his ass kicked.  You ever see the weatherman come on every day, you know, chances are, you know, always  chances are and things like that.  It's stupid.  You go to school to teach, ask you how much is 3 plus 4?  You can't go nearly 7 with a 20% chance of being 8 and maybe 9 in the low-lying areas. 
[00:26:30]  This weatherman needs his ass kicked.  I could go on and on and on.  People need the ass kicked.  Ah, there you go.  Hey, do you do the hurricane name bit?  What hurricane?  Names for hurricanes.  I did that one time, too.  We were about to, about the ethnic name.  They don't have a hurricane Bueller and stuff like that.  Now, that's a wreck for you when it comes through town.  Right.  But I forget more than I do.  That's a funny bit, though.  I do.  How the names of the hurricanes are all, you know, lame names.  Hurricane Leroy, I did things like that coming up.  You know there's going to be a lot of stuff missing like that. 
[00:27:00]  But I got a question for you guys because I was on radio the other morning.  We were talking about, are there any trailer homes in Manhattan in the boroughs, the five  boroughs of New York City?  No, not that I've seen.  No, we have projects out here.  So you can't have a hurricane up here like, you know, because, you know, the hurricanes  only go where there are trailer parks, right?  No, you can have a hurricane.  But you can have a tornado.  A tornado.  What's the difference between a tornado and a hurricane?  A tornado is over the land.  One blows and one sucks.  Over the land.  I know that.  One's wet and one's dry.  She's coming alive now.  Oh.  She's coming alive now. 
[00:27:30]  The hurricane's wet.  If she was naked, I would have laughed at that.  I heard the wind blowing.  So did some of the week go by?  Somebody's going to get naked up in here before we go.  All right, let's go to Frank.  Listen, I got a question, man.  My grill is broken.  How do I return it?  You're what?  That's not George Foreman.  I'm trying to cook damn ribs and my grill is broken.  I'm like, good George is on Opie and Nancy.  Let me call him up.  He's got to return the damn thing.  He needs his ass kicked too instead of those things.  You know, if he comes down with one more thing, set it and forgive it. 
[00:28:00]  I need to put his ass in there and set it and forget it.  I'm tired of these talk shows.  What do you call these cooking shows?  I did one of those last week too.  I did the guy, what's the black guy named with the, the black guy, Harry and Ainsley.  What's his name?  Oh, his first name, not Harriet?  Harriet.  Well, it ought to be.  No.  So he's doing the show.  And then I got the old ladies on there.  You know, you got Emerald.  Bam.  I mean, I did the old lady that needs to retire.  Wasn't Julia Charles?  Julia Charles.  She can't even lift up me anymore.  You ever see her just leaning on her?  You guys, ooh, the chicken is heavy. 
[00:28:30]  You get the chicken and, oh my goodness.  And don't eat the, you know, and drooling all over the food.  You should, so watch on TV the next time.  We've seen her.  She's quasi-modo now.  She's got a hunchback.  She's turning into quasi-modo.  That's not nice.  Don't say, don't talk about the hump in her back.  She's got a hunchback.  I saw the hump, but did I admit to the hump?  I don't know what it is.  She's kind of like quasi-modo, bent over sideways.  And the chicken is just a beautiful piece of chicken.  The hump is too bad, but the drooling is fine, George. 
[00:29:00]  I didn't know where the line was here.  She's mixing the sauce with her boobs at this point.  Because they certainly reach over in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is too much fun.  I'm telling you, I'm having a good time.  Man, let's go to Bill.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Bill.  I had seen George Walsh on some game shows.  Weren't you on, like, Hollywood Squares or something?  Oh, you know, I'm so stupid.  I'm a regular on Hollywood Squares.  You guys are looking at me.  Like a long time ago, back with the other guy.  No, hell no.  I'm on the new Hollywood Squares.  How old were you when your mind just got up and walked away from you? 
[00:29:30]  What's your name, Frank?  I could have been your daddy, but your mama didn't have change.  Yeah, that's good.  Hold on.  There is a trailer park.  You're a new york guy.  Where?  Danny, what's up?  Yeah, New York City has one trailer park.  It's in Staten Island.  That is bull.  I control it.  Really?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  I've been a...  Control it.  He's like the Gotti of the trailer park.  I control it.  That's my territory. 
[00:30:00]  He said, patrol it.  Patrol it.  Not control it.  Patrol it.  He's a ranger.  He's one of those guys out there that really think he's important.  You know, some people think they're important.  You ever see the security guard riding at the mall, the security guard in the car?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If he's got that little yellow light on, oh, hell, he wants to write your ticket so bad.  But he can't.  Some people really think their job is important.  And he got his head down.  He got his head down.  Yeah.  He's walking around.  And he's all tight.  Those are renter cops, right?  Yeah.  You know who else think they're really important?  Their job is more important than really the janitor at the school. 
[00:30:30]  Just because he's got all those keys.  He think he owns that damn school.  You know that?  He's got a master key.  And the person out in the crosswalk person, the usually little lady with that stop sign,  oh, that's her corner.  You can't tell her anything better than that.  You can't even go, you stop right now.  A lot of people think their job's more important than they are.  Take your clothes off.  Candy apples.  You're not laughing at the comedic stylings of George Wallace.  He's brilliant.  She's amazing.  She's just looking at me.  Yeah, I'm just having fun here.  No, when you're with a great bunch of people, all you can do is have fun. 
[00:31:00]  I have the best job in the world.  Just have F-O-N.  Just hang out and have fun.  Let's go to Georgette.  Georgette, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right.  Bonjour.  Hey, George, I remember you as a kid, about like maybe 10 years old, and you did this bit  about Burger King, making burgers the way you like it.  Oh, have it your way.  When you were about 10 years old, sometimes you've got to break the rules.  That used to be my bit.  Sometimes you've got to break the rules.  You know, I used to walk in and say, how about throwing a couple extra waffles on there?  Sometimes you've got to break the rules.  See, that was funny then.  See, I do commercials.  I just pay attention to everything in life.  Like the new commercial, An Army of One. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  Now, what the hell is up with that, An Army of One?  I've heard that one from the audience.  You go AWOL, you've got to go look for yourself.  You've got to wake up in the morning, you've got to blow your own bugle.  You know what I'm talking about.  I mean, An Army of One.  Don't ask.  You can't ask.  You can't tell anybody either, you know?  Yeah.  It's amazing.  You get mail, you've got to call out your own name.  Wallace.  Oh, here it's me.  An Army of One.  It's a present.  It's a present.  You know, just stupid things I talk about.  Nick, what's going on?  That last guy that called you about the trailer park at Staten Island? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  He was wrong.  The trailer park isn't in Staten Island.  It is Staten Island.  Ouch.  Ouch.  That'll leave him bruised.  Later, guys.  All right, Nick.  Thank you.  Let's go to Craig.  Craig, what's up, buddy?  Craig.  Hello.  Hey.  Yeah.  Go ahead, buddy.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  Okay.  George Wallace, did you do a show with Joe Piscopo many years ago?  Did you dress up as Oprah Winfrey?  Yes, I did.  It was a Halloween show. 
[00:32:30]  That was the funniest thing in the world, man.  See, the funniest thing in the world.  See, I told you people can say some stupid things.  See, you could win Mr. Universe.  Well, thank you so much for remembering that.  I had a good time with that.  He was Donahue, and I was Oprah.  Was that on SNL?  That was on Saturday night.  Wow.  HBO.  Oh, HBO?  Okay.  All right, Craig.  Thank you.  Okay, thanks a lot.  Have a good day, guys.  Thank you so much.  Come on out to Jersey now.  Make sure you come to Rascal.  HBO now is totally different.

[00:33:00]  Oh, my God.  Huh?  That was me.  That was me.  That was me.  You were the mayor of the prison.  That was me.  I was the mayor of the prison.  Oh, D.  Nice.  Oh, D.  Coming on now, huh?  Nice.  Hallelujah.  All right.  Let's go to Andrew.  Hey, Andrew, what's going on?  Andrew.  Yo.  What's up?  I'm trying to figure out who this guy is.  Did he play the black butler, uh, Benson?  Is that who he is?  No, he's not Benson, you jackass.  And that's a double entendre, black butler.  So, no. 
[00:33:30]  The black mayor.  I'm the black.  Ivan, what's up?  And what makes you think I'm black?  Oh, yeah, you got to go.  Hey, George.  I've been a man of yours for many years, man.  Well, thank you so much.  Are you still in touch with the good times people?  I used to love you on that show, man.  Do you still see Jimmy Walker?  Yes, I do.  Jimmy Walker lives in Las Vegas, and he's still out doing comedy also.  Wait, you were the father on Good Time.  Yes, I was.  You were bookman.  You were bookman.  Oh, Dirty says he was bookman.  You were bookman.  You were? 
[00:34:00]  No.  He was not bookman.  Hey, I'll claim anything.  You name it, I was there.  Why not?  Yeah, what the hell?  Man, he was the son, Michael.  Remember that?  I am.  People see me every week on Hollywood Squares.  You know, call him on Hollywood Squares, people.  Tell him who George Wallace is, please.  Thank you.  All right.  And I don't live in Staten Island.  All right, here's Jackie Mason.  Jackie.  Hello there, George.  How you doing?  Hey there, Jackie.  How are you?  Hey, George, I'm going to be doing another show on Broadway.  Oh, yeah?

I saw you on television once, and you did a bit regarding cats in heat.  Oh, you never see cats making love.  That was the bit.  Things you never see.  You never see cats making love.  Exactly.  You can hear them.  Now. 
[00:35:00]  No.  Now.  Now.  It's ready for you now.  You never hear cats late at night making love.  You think somebody's hurt, you run to the door.  Right on.  Now.  You better leave me.  Now.

Oh, you were Lamont, too?  You were Buckeye, man.  Yo, I just came from the cemetery.  I couldn't find no roses, so I just got some dandelions.  Yeah, we're going to have a good one, all right?

You were a super, were you?  No, that was Bookman.  That was, I don't know his name. 
[00:37:00]  I do know him, however, but I don't remember his name.  My man right here.  And I do believe you were the second Grady that was brought in in the later parts of  Sanford and Sonny.  The second Grady.  Hey, man.  Look at George.  He likes S to roll.  Yeah, everyone knows I like S to roll.  James!  James!  Damn, damn, damn.  Damn, damn, damn.  When she finally broke down after James died.  She was handling everything.  Everyone's amazed at how she was holding up for the whole thing.  And then she just went, damn, damn, James!

Okay.  1027.  WNW.  What a crew we have in here today.  Old, dirty.  Candy apples.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the great George Wallace.  Thank you so much, Opie.  No one knows what you did on TV, but we all know you're famous for something.  I've done so much, man.  A lot of people are so confused as to who you are. 
[00:39:00]  That's why the phones are ringing off at Rascals right now.  A lot of people saying, I loved you as Rerun.  Yo, you were Rerun.  You know, Anthony, I'm only going to hit you one time.  Anthony, Anthony, you're making this stuff up over there.  I see you writing it down.  I'll show it to you.  I can't even talk, you know?  I can't even talk.  You're making me sick, man.  I'll be like my tights.  All right, let me go to Frank.  Frank, what's going on? 
[00:39:30]  Hello.  Hey, Frank, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Hey, listen.  This guy, I've been a fan since I'm a kid.  Nice.  Can he do his famous signature line?  Dino-mite.  No, he's too fat to be the Dino-mite guy.  Oh, now he's calling me fat.  I call him a show.  I'm being insulted here.  He put on weight since the times went off the air?  All I'm saying is that you're a little fatter than Jimmy Walker.  Yeah, I'm sick a little bit.  I'm a little bigger than him.  I'm more buff.  You guys can make the number 10.  Hey, you get it.  Is he bigger than the rolls of fat on Estorol Florida's neck? 
[00:40:00]  No, the back of his neck.  Be nice.  He looks like a package of hot dogs.  Well, how about your mama?  Your mama's so fat the left side of her ass has a different area of code.  I hear your mama's so fat she has a real horse on her polo shirt.  I got to take that, Joe.  Don't you talk about Estorol and the Winnie Packs on the back of her neck, dude.  I hear your mama suck when she go in the woods to trees, pee on her. 
[00:40:30]  Wow.  Hey, you know what?  At least I know who my mama is.  Oh.  Oh, you know the difference between your mama and the D-Train?  What?  None.  For $1.50, you can ride both of them all day.  Your mama's like a doorknob.  Everybody takes a turn.  Oh.  I hear your mama keep ice in her drawer so she can keep the crabs fresh.  Your mama's like a bag of potato chips.  Layers, 25 cents.  You know, I hear they call your mama potato chips. 
[00:41:00]  You know why?  Because she's free to lay.  Bam!  Come on, dude.  You're cool, man.  You're all right with me, too, dude.  I love you.  He knows how to play the game.  Thank you so much, man.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Challenger.  My sister says, why is he talking about my mama?  I said, this joke's got nothing to do with your mama.  Shut the hell up.  You don't challenge George.  You know, I'm the king of the mama jokes.  They call them snaps, Jonah.  Yeah, the snaps.  I'm the king of that.  You didn't know that, did you?  The old dirty.  Oh, nah.  I could bring you around the way.  You probably got some new ones, man.  Nah, I got some. 
[00:41:30]  Because I hear your mama has a glass leg and they pour chocolate milk in there.  And when you want to call her, you just go, you.  Come on, dirty.  Come on, man.  I can't really hear me.  Say, George, it doesn't work as well when white boys do the mama jokes.  Yes, it does.  No, we sound stupid.  Do one.  No, I ain't doing one.  You got one.  Come on, man.  I got many.  Come on.  Oh, man.  Hey, let's say hi to our buddy, our pal, Jay Moore, everyone.  Jay.  Jay.  First of all, respect to George Wallace.  This guy is the funniest. 
[00:42:00]  See?  That's my buddy, Jay.  And I want to say, George, I always love the work you did on the A-team.  And I like the work you're doing on XFL, too.  Your mama's so black, you pour water on her head, coffee comes out her mouth.  Your mama's so cross, I should drop it down and pick up two nickels.  Come on.  Oh, no.  Come on, Jay.  Come on.  You're the king.  I can't beat the king.  I just called out of respect.  Okay.  You're just a good guy.  When he said George Wallace was on, I thought it was the governor of Mississippi.  I said, that guy still was. 
[00:42:30]  Remember that guy?  Yeah, I remember him.  We remember the governor of Mississippi.  Are you related to him?  Yes, I am.  I am the same guy.  I went to California, got a little son, got up out of the wheelchair.  I'm the same guy.  I watch George all the time at the Laugh Factor, and he's just one of the greatest.  He's the greatest class act that you'll ever see.  He's hilarious.  See, it's also a class act.  You can come out and you can bring your mom, you can bring everybody.  I'm not dirty.  So you thought I was dirty, then your uncle.  No, he's not dirty.  He's just funny.  I don't even curse.  I don't even curse on the states.  He's from Atlanta, right?  That's right.  I'm from Atlanta, Georgia, the ATL.  Dirty South. 
[00:43:00]  You're going to get a word.  Look at all Dirty representing.  Yo, you seen that tape, Jay?  Which one?  The Dirty South.  What the hell are you talking about?  Yeah, man.  Hey, George, you're from Atlanta?  Yes, I am.  Anthony, what is that festival they do?  Freak Nick.  Freak Nick, yeah.  Yeah, that's the tape, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you explain Freak Nick to us?  Because Anthony and I were down there for Freak Nick and all the locals that are like our  color, they leave town.  Well, no joke.  But because, see, what happens and stuff.  They get a little scared.  See, all the people your color, they go down to Fort Lauderdale. 
[00:43:30]  They go to Fort Lauderdale down on the beach down there.  I go down there, too.  I get down there.  I freak the people out in Fort Lauderdale.  I put on a blonde wig and I just stretch out.  And people walk by, hey, hey, hey, fella, you better turn over.  But, see, I go down there.  But Atlanta's a Freak Nick.  Opie, what the hell is wrong with you?  That's funny.  No, no, no.  See, a Freak Nick is where the black college kids, they go to Atlanta.  But that's fading out a little bit.  They're going other places now.  But the locals, they board up and everything.  They get a little scared.  You know why they do that, Opie? 
[00:44:00]  Why?  They go into the bad parts of town.  They get all their stuff back.  Oh, wow.  I mean, oh, wow.  Wow.  That's good.  That's wow good.  You know, good.  Well, it's just a vacation place for the African-American kids to go and have a good time in Atlanta.  Atlanta's the city.  You have a good time.  They're from Africa?  What?  I thought he said for the African kids.  What did he just say?  I'm serious.  I said African-American kids.  What tribe?  He's a little better.  They're black, George. 
[00:44:30]  Just call them black.  You know, his hearing is a little bad, you know.  And his mama's so stupid, she's walking by the YMCA.  She said, look, baby.  Somebody spelled Mace is wrong.  George's mother got fired from the M&M factory for throwing out the threes.  Oh, I heard that.  Listen to him.  I know that's right.  You're getting pissed off.  I heard your mama talk back the last time she saw 90210, her ass was on the scale.  Your mom's got a vagina on her hip so she can make money on the side.  Oh. 
[00:45:00]  That was a joke I was going to do.  Oh, let's go.  Then what you got?  Listen to him.  You have to come to the club to hear him.  We're going to do all of that.  I'll challenge everybody.  And you can get the job.  I don't care who gets the laugh.  I'm the one taking the check on him.  Don't forget, Mr. Wallace.  That's right.  George, I just called to give you the respect.  Well, thank you so much, man.  Always, always.  This is good guys.  You know, some guys that are just good, you know.  Jay Moore, one of them.  All right.  Hey, Jay, thank you.  Tell Dice that.  Hey, don't call anyone.  Don't call anyone anymore.  Hey, George. 
[00:45:30]  What?  I went to visit your sister because she owed me money.  Mm-hmm.  And when I was on my way up the driveway, your mother came out from under the porch and  bit my leg.  Oh.  I just met your mom on the street a few moments ago with her mattress on the back since she's  late for work.  I just wanted to set him up again, so I had to roll out the stupid one and set him up  to kill me.  I'm a good number two hitter, and then you get all the good pitches.  There you go.  You're getting all the money.  Hey, guys, I just called to give respect to George and let everybody know. 
[00:46:00]  I think he's fantastic, or whatever it's worth.  All right, Jay, thank you.  You guys suck.  All right.  Here it goes, Jay Moore.  I'm glad you got a friend like that to call in.  Oh, Jay's the best.  John, what's going on?  Hey, John.  Hello.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up?  Is that George?  Well, it's on the show.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan.  I'm a big fan.  I love them in the Green Mile.  Let's talk to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  How are you doing?  I just wanted to tell this guy.  I remember back when he used to dress in women's clothes. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  He used to call himself Geraldine.  Yeah.  I think he's a lot funnier now that he changed his name from Flip, so.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  That's good.  All right.  I think we get the joke now.  Yeah.  Let's go to Luther.  Luther.  Hello?  Luther?  Yeah.  How you doing, Luther?  Hey, what's going on, man?  You got to come on with it.  Talk to me.  Hey, hey, come on, man.  You know, your father's so black, he gets in the car, the oil light comes on.  Come on, man.  Your dad is so black, you sprinkle salt on him.  It looks like deep space.  Get off my back.  Man, your family's so black, on their whole hands, they look like a stretch limo. 
[00:47:00]  I hear your mama has so many children, the birth certificate read, we the people.  Come on, talk to me.  Oh, okay.  I know you're reading the book.  Your mama's so black when the cops shot bulls at her, they came back looking for flashlights.  Oh, man, your mama's so black, she used armor on for lotion.  Come on, talk to me.  Oh, yo, yo, your teeth so rotten, when you smile, you look like you got a mouth full of dice.  Come on, baby.  Your teeth are so yellow, when cars pass your house, they slow down.  Come on, talk to me.  Oh, hey, man, George, I've been a big fan for years and years and years and years, man. 
[00:47:30]  And you know we have...  Everybody's funny.  You know what I am?  I'm a marketing guy.  I used to be, 20 years ago, I was vice president of an advertising agency in New York.  They put all the spectaculars down in Times Square, all the 5,000 buses in New York City and the subways.  I was vice president doing that now.  There's a market for everybody, no matter what you do.  You may not like what somebody does, but there's somebody out there that cares for that.  Andrew Dice packs the room, Seinfeld packs the room, I packed the room, doesn't matter.  Old Dirty packs the room, it's just people want to see.  Everybody's got a market out there. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, I pack the room, I pack a jail cell.  He packs the bodega.  Yeah.  You been to jail, man?  Oh, yeah, plenty.  What'd you go for?  Oh, I'd rather not say that.  You know, I've got a habit of getting things out of people that are going to...  Try to get out of Old Dirty.  He's just there for some riffraff.  I'm trying to get away from that.  I want you to be away from that because I want you to be the person that you can be.  I want you to be all that you can be.  You was Apollo Creed and Rocky?  That was everything.  That's it?  That was everything.  I'm everything for you.  I'm here for you.  All right, we should take a break. 
[00:48:30]  We have to catch up a little bit.  Wow, yeah.  Look at this time.  This show's flying.  Candy Apples, thank you very much.  Miss New Universe 2000.  Candy Apples.  Yes.  Yes.  In bizarro world.  Oh, D.  She doesn't even know what that meant.  Yeah, that was...  What do we call that?  That reference, man.  What would we call that?  You can't even say it to her face.  Turn around.  Bizarro world.  You said it to my face.  But she doesn't know what it means, so... 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Obscure reference of the day, folks.  All right, we'll be back.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony,  and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone.  You want some of this?  No longer will our penises remain placid and unused.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:49:30]  Look at us hanging out with George Wallace, Anthony.  You should be so lucky.  We are lucky.  I know that, but I'm lucky to be here, too.  I feel good all over.  You beat out Miss New Universe 2000?  I can't believe that, man.  She's...  I'm still here.  She's gone.  That should be very telling right there.  Let me tell you something.  We're like...  All right, George Wallace will come in.  He'll do a couple jokes.  Then we can focus on what we really want to do. 
[00:50:00]  Miss New Universe 2000.  Let me tell you something.  I'm going down to see Miss New.  I'll talk to these two buttheads,  and I'll get the hell out of here.  Now we're here all friends together.  So you never know what's going to happen.  That's right.  That's it.  Hey, you want to meet Stalker Patty?  Who?  This girl stalks us.  She's outside the studio right now.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  So she's here?  Yeah.  Here's a stalker that you let her talk to?  We have lots of stalkers,  but we figure we should keep them close  instead of having them lurking around corners and stuff.  So you know what you're going to do on.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  This girl stalks us.  This is Stalker Patty.  No joke.  No joke.  Look at her.  She's 55 and a virgin, George.  I'm not 55.  55.  Oh, I'm sorry.  45.  Is she a virgin?  You're a virgin?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Oh, it's so good to meet you.  Me too.  Yeah.  But I met you out there.  Don't tell the people.  They don't know.  She's, what, 45?  Yes.  45.  Yes.  Look at her.  And a virgin.  Like a virgin.  Patty, you...  Ooh!  Right? 
[00:51:00]  Patty, you putting on some pounds?  No.  Are you pregnant?  She might be concealing.  Did we pat her down a little...  No.  What do you got there in the bunt region?  Wow, yeah, you got a little bunt happening.  What's going on?  Is it the pants?  It makes you look like you got a bunt.  Did you go to the grocery store to get dinner?  Or what's going on in front of your pants?  What happened there?  Oh, very funny.  Or is it the hair growing back from your waxing?  I like the outfit.  It's very Kiki D.  Kiki D?  Who's Kiki D?  Who the hell is a designer? 
[00:51:30]  Don't worry about it.  It's a designer, Kiki D.  It's very 1982.  No, that's like 1976.  Didn't you ever see the video of Elton John and Kiki D?  You bought them at Phil Roachers.  Remember the store Phil Roachers?  I think you're very beautiful.  I don't care what they say.  You know, these guys are really...  No, it's wild.  I think you washed your hair.  I wash my hair every night.  Yeah, what's going on?  Because you did something to it.  Now it's...  It's a little poofy.  It's a little poofier.  Usually it's the stringy.  Stringy and greasy.  Now you've got some kind of body volume going. 
[00:52:00]  You need a new conditioner now.  Ah, the new conditioner.  What's his name?  New conditioner and a comb.  Very nice, yes.  A comb.  So, Patty, you love these guys?  Of course I do.  Which one would you like to marry?  Which one would you like to take home?  Which one would you like to rock their world?  Shut up.  Would you like to rock Old Dirty's world?  Hell no.  I'll put her on the street, my brother.  Wow, Old Dirty turning down a woman.  Wow.  Nah, well...  Not even horny goldweed will get me a man, my brother. 
[00:52:30]  All right, Patty, what did you bring us today?  She makes no money, George.  She works at McDonald's.  She makes no money.  She works at McDonald's.  Well, don't come in there with those old fucking French fries.  I decided to wish you weeks a very happy Valentine's Day.  Patty, you're going to wish us?  Thank you very much.  Oh, no.  See, this is the box of Brack.  Opie, you'll love your beanie baby.  I picked it out just for you.  Perfect type gas thing. 
[00:53:00]  Elmer Candy Corporation.  Beanie babies.  That's so 1998.  What the hell is this?  That's a part of a line called meanie beanies, but they're cute.  I get it.  I'm sure you've got a Furby in that bag for me somewhere.  A Furby.  I'm surprised.  Nobody knows it, but I like to bake as a hobby, so I even brought my blondies down.  Blondies?  Blondies?  I put some of the blondies that I baked over the weekend into a nice tin and decided to just pass some on to you. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, we'll let George try first.  The royal taster.  He's the royal cup holder.  I swear to God, I said, they got me sitting here this long.  There's a set up somewhere.  I gave one to Virginia at the desk, and she loved it.  That's what the ambulance just picked up.  Oh, stop.  Where'd you get that recipe?  Off the side of a cereal box?  No.  No.  Rice Krispie Squares.  No.  Patty, look at my candy.  It's not even organized or anything.  What happened?  I was carrying it in a bag. 
[00:54:00]  I'm sorry.  And there's one missing.  No, no.  You eat one.  That's not true.  You try it.  I can't see.  You try it.  I'm not going to try it.  You try it.  I know.  I like it.  No, Virginia liked it.  It's made with unbleached flour, baking powder, honey, milk.  You put bleach in it.  You put bleach in it.  Unbleached flour is a little sugar.  You put bleach in it.  You bleached the flour?  No.  It's unbleached flour.  What the hell is unbleached flour?  Well, why didn't you bleach it?  We want bleach flour.  We don't want unbleached flour.  It's unbleached flour.  It's all wheat. 
[00:54:30]  Well, I just don't use refined ingredients in my cooking.  Oh, yeah.  You're all natural.  Yes.  Let me find out you took these ingredients from said place of employment.  You were pilfering?  She's got something else in the bag.  Well, but, Opie, this is a special one for you.  Ah, see?  Look.  You can break it.  What does it say?  It says, Opie.  What does that?  Break my heart.  It says, Opie.  I bought that for you just to break. 
[00:55:00]  It was a big balloon, a big heart mylar balloon, and she actually got the name Opie on it.  Oh, that's right.  It says, frighten me.  I hope he didn't hesitate.  No.  Anthony, who has a better mustache?  What?  Sucker Patty or Old Dirty?  I don't have that.  Oh, wow.  I don't have anything.  How did that work out for you, Patty?  Come here.  Very well.  Let me see.  Let me see the upper lip.  She did.  She had a lot of hair removed, George.  She had nipple hair removed?  Yes, she did. 
[00:55:30]  Can you show George your lack of nipple hair?  Oh, no.  No, no, show me that.  Please, please, man.  I got to go to dinner.  I got to go to dinner.  I got to go to dinner.  No, please.  They just did the treatment yesterday.  All right.  Well, show George what they could do.  No, no, no.  They removed their breast?  No.  No, she's just the hair.  She's just the hair.  She baked them into the Rice Krispies.  All right, so she's a little flat, but she was a little hairy, too, on top of that. 
[00:56:00]  But you're okay now, Patty?  I'm fine.  They removed the hair from your chest?  Yes, they have.  Was it long hair?  Was it short hair?  Was it, you know, like a very good one?  Was it braids?  Was it braids?  You ain't going to find a good one, Ann.  It's braids.  A lot of women get it.  I've been through four candies.  I'm taking little bites.  I'm trying to find a good one.  Nothing with peanuts?  Oh, nothing I love better than the goddamn orange ones that taste like St. Joseph's baby aspirin.  So you're actually eating those, huh? 
[00:56:30]  Sure.  Well, I'm trying to find a good one.  Hey, I saw her wrapping that box out in the locker room.  Oh, damn.  Here, George.  What's the syringe hole in the top of the candy box?  Give it to George.  George, would you like a piece of candy?  It was wrapped.  They're really good.  You'll break her heart if you don't have one.  I ate one already.  She gave it a box outside.  No, you didn't.  I swear she did.  No, you didn't.  I swear, but I lied to you.  I ate one.  I swear.  I did.  Do me a favor.  I'll eat the candy if you eat the brownie. 
[00:57:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I think the brownie's good.  Patty, show George your lack of nipple hair.  Please.  No.  Please.  Don't you want him to come back?  No, no, no.  She's nice.  She's nice.  It's my first time here.  Come on.  Show George Wallace.  This means we really like you.  Trust me.  Let me tell you something.  He's a real good fan.  He's a major star.  He was on Johnny Carson.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  No, Jay Leno.  Do the ladder.  Do the bass.  Do the real.  The Letterman show.  I do a Hollywood Square and things like that.  You really want me to show you the results?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  George, if you show me the hair on your chest, I'm going to turn it into Steve Earle.  I don't care.  The most vicious boobs you've ever seen in your life.  All right, show George.  Show George.  Okay.  Is that your sweater or your hairy boobs?  Oh, it's a sweater.  Okay.  I'll be off too.  All right.  Let's see.  George, George, take a look.  Take a look.  George, take a look. 
[00:58:00]  Lift him up.  Uh-oh.  We didn't quite get enough.  Somebody fan me.  We didn't quite get enough.  Oh, fan me with a brick.  Knock me out, Jack.  Damn.  No, Patty.  Wow.  You're going to have to do that again.  She's doing better than Miss Nude.  Move to your right a little and do it again.  Go ahead.  Right there.  Now do it.  Now, George, look this time.  No, a little over to the right more.  The right, not backwards.  Jesus Christ.  Take some direction.  We're abusing the handicapped. 
[00:58:30]  We're abusing the handicapped.  I'm not handicapped.  Go ahead, Patty.  Wow, what the hell are you wearing underneath?  What's those black things?  That's your underwear?  Those are new de-pins.  Big bloomers.  The pins come in colors now.  Patty, what the hell is that black thing?  It's my pantyhose.  Pantyhose?  My pantyhose.  If you show me your black thing, I'll show you my black thing.  Hey, Patty, after your hair removal, did your cup size go down?  No. 
[00:59:00]  And there was a teacup, too.  A teacup.  All right, Patty, there you go.  Let's go.  Mr. Wiles, please, if you will, take a peek.  Please, look at what's wrong with you.  I have to go to work tomorrow.  Damn.  I know I'm not Miss Universe.  I keep missing.  George, why aren't you looking?  I have things to do.  I tried to get the horror up there.  I have to help my kids with their homework.  I'm not Miss Universe, I know.  Yeah, this woman gives Patch a bad name, dude. 
[00:59:30]  Gives Patch a bad name.  All right, let's go to the phones.  Patty, thank you for your lovely gifts.  Steve.  Yeah, O&E.  How you doing, man?  Good.  I wanted to tell you, man, that I've seen him at the laughing factory.  Who, George Wiles?  Yeah.  Okay.  He was funny, man.  He was funny.  He's hilarious.  He's downright hilarious, man.  Oh, I just got one question.  Yeah.  Your boob contest, you had a man come in there with man boobs, and now you have a woman come 
[01:00:00]  in there with man chest hair.  I don't care.  That's pretty freaked out, man.  She has no hair anymore.  No hair?  No.  Mm-mm.  Oh, well, it's always nice to have a non-hairy handicap come to the show.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Yeah, thanks.  Put on a good show, guys.  I got stuck.  I'm going to go here.  All right.  Thank you.  A non-handy handicap.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Guys, you've got to know something's wrong with you, too.  If you're giving Stalker Patty more airtime than you're giving Miss New World.  Right.  Miss New Universe.  You weren't here.  Oh, well, excuse me. 
[01:00:30]  You weren't here.  And then she's trying to go toe-to-toe with George Wallace with the jokes.  So you're not here for the jokes.  That's a mistake.  She did pretty good with the brownies.  Miss New Universe 2000.  Year 2000 on what planet in the universe?  Surely it wasn't Earth.  Surely it wasn't Earth.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Rob.  Take it easy.  Well, Patty, I guess thanks and stuff, so.  Oh, you're welcome.  You could leave now.  It sounds a feast.  What? 
[01:01:00]  What?  I'm not going to lie to you guys.  I'm kind of a **** up.  I've been in the city for like three weeks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm leaving with Patty.  All right.  That'll be a nice, because Patty's a virgin, so be gentle.  I will.  Get your bottle in there and let's get the hell out of here.  Hey, George, are you packing?  You packing some heat or what?  Well, yeah, a lot of people think I'm wearing a belt.  A lot of people want us to isolate.  A lot of people want us to isolate. 
[01:01:30]  You're the king of like the one-liner.  Isolate the clip where Patty said, I'll kill you, Opie.  Oh, I'll kill you.  She said, I'll kill you, Opie.  Isolate that, because that might become evidence.  That's admissible in court.  Admissible in court.  Now, when you finally do, kill him.  All right, Patty.  Stop.  Bye, Patty.  Bye, anyway.  All right.  Happy death.  Patty, you got a bunt going there.  What happened?  You're putting on weight?  Got a little pouch.  A bunt?  Yeah, you're getting like a bunt.  I'm seeing something that looks like a schlong. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, what's that schlong-y thing right there?  Point out.  Do you have stuff tucked in those pants?  Well, when the doctor gave her those hormone pills, and when the hair came out on the chest,  it made a little thing.  Yeah.  Made that grow out.  Patty, you tucking stuff in there?  What do you got?  Patty, there's a lot of lumps down there.  It's a little lumpy in your pants.  What's going on?  Look at that.  Yeah, there's too much unnatural lumps.  Right there.  Grab your junk.  Grab your junk.  Because you got a big, you got junk.  Just like this.  Don't look at me.  Watch me.  Patty, you look like this.  Grab this and then grab that.  Patty, you look just like the sticky fingers cover. 
[01:02:30]  What's going on down there?  Yeah.  She does, though.  Look at that.  No, Patty, pat that down over there.  What's that?  Either that or Al Gore's Rolling Stone cover.  It's just my sweater.  No, man.  No.  Poke it.  Poke it with a pencil, Old Dirty.  No, over there.  What's over there?  Right there.  Poke it.  There's a little thing sticking out right there.  Patty, let him poke it.  Come here.  What is that?  Patty, come here.  Come here, Patty.  Let him poke it with the pen.  Opie wants me to poke it.  Poke it with the other side of the pen. 
[01:03:00]  Patty's getting poked by Old Dirty.  No, it's to the right.  Yeah, right there.  What's that?  What is that, Patty?  It's just my jeans.  No, you're...  Whatever it is, it's bigger than mine.  I can do that.  Patty, it looks like you got a Johnson.  Yeah.  Looks like you're sporting wood.  Patty, pull your pants down.  No.  What the hell are you sporting in there?  You've got something going on there.  What is that?  Just undo your fly.  We don't have to see the patch or anything.  I want to see what you got underneath there.  Yeah, what are you tucking in? 
[01:03:30]  You just got the sweater.  The sweater?  We're talking about your pants.  You got a sweater in your pants.  Yeah, it's too poofy in the fly.  Yeah, there's a lot of poof.  Patty, you don't have to pull down your pants.  Just undo it so we can see what's exactly right there.  Please don't pull your pants down.  Yeah, we're begging you.  But just so we can see what's stuffed in there.  All right, there.  See?  That's a sweater.  What's underneath the sweater?  What's under there?  My pantyhose.  What kind of pantyhose?  I wear legs sheer energy. 
[01:04:00]  No, re-etards.  Looks like you're not pregnant, right?  Re-etards.  Looks like you've got an arm sticking out.  It would be the second case in history if I was.  You got a conjoined twin in your pants?  What's going on down there?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Some clothes make me look fatter.  That's cool.  George is speechless for the first time in two hours.  I know.  First time of his life.  What happened, Mr. Wallace?  Are you wearing snatch panties?  I'm wearing thongs. 
[01:04:30]  Stash panties.  What are you wearing?  Oh, boy.  I got to see this.  We got to see the thong.  Patty is wearing a thong.  Let me find out you're wearing a thong for Opie.  No.  Let's see your thong.  Let's see your thong.  Come on, come on.  You're wearing a thong?  George wants to see it.  Come on, that's sexy.  O.D. wants to see it.  You know how famous...  Anthony wants to see it.  Yeah.  You know how famous George Wallace is?  Let's go.  Just do it for Opie.  You know Opie is your...  No, come on.  Let's see the thong. 
[01:05:00]  He's your main screen.  A quick thong shot.  Come on, come on.  Patty's thong.  Let's see the thong.  Let's see the thong.  Where'd you pick it up, Patty?  There it is, okay?  What is it?  Let me see.  It's a little purple number.  Why are you wearing that stuff, man?  You don't get action.  You're wearing, like, Kevlar pantyhose and the pants.  Why bother with the thong?  You got a little plan later on?  No.  Do you dress maybe expecting that if something happens and you do hook up, you want to have  nice underwear on?  I'm ready for it.  Well...  Just in case. 
[01:05:30]  It's just regular underwear.  But doesn't it tend to give you a wedgie for no apparent reason?  Like, a lot of girls wear it because it looks good through thin pants or something.  You're wearing pantyhose that I swear to God were...  No offense, all dirty, but it was like Puerto Ricans' Toyota Celica windows.  That's how black they were tinted.  I couldn't see through them.  And you got these big blue jeans on, so why bother with the thong? 
[01:06:00]  You got too much going on.  You could have a chastity belt under there, we wouldn't be able to tell.  So why bother with the thong unless maybe a little romance in the air?  No, I don't have a boyfriend.  I think Patty should keep it a secret.  What about Mr. Clean, the tighty belt man, somebody like that?  You going to hook up with somebody?  You're going to hook up with somebody?  Anything?  I'm sorry, excuse me.  I didn't mean to get that on you.  Maybe I'll meet somebody at one of the tapings, who knows? 
[01:06:30]  Oh, that's the crowd you want to choose a lover from.  Let me ask you a question.  Our audience, sure.  Somebody out of all the good-looking men in here now,  if you had your choice of going to bed with one of us.  Who are you laughing at?  Because she knows the answer's open.  Who's it going to be?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Josh.  Yay, gentlemen, what's up?  Hey.  I have a question for Stalker Patty.  Hey, Stalker Patty.  Do you use your f***ing yeast instead of unbleached flour for your baking goods? 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my God, Josh.  Next question.  That was a Pillsbury Doughboy that called.  Probably.  All right, Patty.  It was interesting to see you.  I'm glad I entertained you.  Yeah, you know, you got a little naked.  I'm glad I entertained you.  All right, Patty.  Okay.  We got to get back to the funnies.  Patty.  Let's go now, Patty.  The two of us, we're going to get out of here, and we're going to go home, and we're going to, like, really get down. 
[01:07:30]  Like I said, it was great to see Patty.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  This just in.  Cisco just shot himself.  That's funny.  All right.  Like I said, it was really good to see Patty.  Patty, everyone.  Bye, Patty.  Patty and her thong.  That thong, that thong, thong, thong, thong.  There she goes.  Bye, Patty.  Bye, bye.  Patty.  There she goes.  Letting all the ladies know what guys talk about. 
[01:08:00]  Baby, get a butt.  Butt, butt.  Baby, get a butt.  Butt, butt.  Check it out.  That's Patty's new song.  Baby, she liked to pop.  Cause she was living that big down low.  Cause she had some stuff like a truck.  But I was like, what? 
[01:08:30]  Baby, when you're not.  But I think I'm singing again.  She had some stuff like a truck.  Yeah.  I was like, what?  All night long.  Let me leave that thong.  No, no, let's not.  Let's not.  No.  Oh, God damn it. 
[01:09:00]  Could the thong be ruined forever now?  You got a problem, dude.  Why?  Yeah.  What are you going to do with this woman?  Everyone thinks it's a joke.  That's no joke.  And you know how she says she loves,  she just loves the show and everything about it.  But notice, every time,  Opie gets something just a little extra,  you're a little special.  She loves Opie.  It's not a joke.  Cause George didn't even have any jokes.  Cause he didn't want to go there.  I'm still, you know,  she brought you the cookies and the blondies. 
[01:09:30]  What the hell is a blondie?  What is that?  That's a blonde brownie.  Oh, blondies, brownie.  Got it, George.  Of course.  You should get it also, you know?  Oh, my God.  You got to go back to me.  Come on, you know?  Yeah, man.  Yeah, this one happening up in here, eh?  It's all good, you know?  Well, I want to thank you  because I got a play to go to tonight.  Oh, you son of a gun.  You know, you leaving us?  Listen, I had about another.  He's got a show.  And he's had it.  No, no. 
[01:10:00]  No, that's okay.  You guys, I really had a lot of fun.  I wish I could stay  because it was a lot of fun just being here.  Well, you guys, I got a play tonight at 7.  I got a shower and all that stuff, you know?  All right, you're going to have to come back.  Anytime you want me back, I'll be back.  You got to be on.  All right, we'll call you.  I had a lot of fun.  Anytime.  You have my now.  I live right up the street.  Yeah, we'll call you some fun.  I'm eight blocks away from Central Park West.  I can just walk right down here.  Look at you, Central Park West.  See this?  I have a career going pretty nice.  Wow.  Uh-huh. 
[01:10:30]  I got it going on like this.  You know what I'm telling you?  I know what I'm saying.  PMW, Central Park West.  Mercedes.  Oh, Mercedes.  Mercedes.  Mercedes.  Oh, come on, guys.  It's just that I've been working.  You know, I don't buy anything.  I just work.  We got to thank George Wallace for coming along.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Opie, Anthony, everybody.  O.D.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I done them both. 
[01:11:00]  Sick-ass weirdo.  1027 WNEW.  Oh, yeah.  Where's my crystal meth?  Shut up.  I'm trying to enjoy this.  You shut up.  Shut up.  Is this your first time with a trucker job?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:11:30]  212-757-1027.  Look who I found wandering around upstairs, Anthony.  I saw that.  What a surprise.  He wasn't supposed to be in until tomorrow.  Hiya, champ.  But my pal, comedian, extraordinaire, star of stage, screen, and occasionally my living  room in front of a Budweiser can, Adam Ferrara.  Let's not forget cable TV.  He was on the list last night. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Each one, huh?  Each one on the list.  Did you get any weed from George Clinton?  No, he was on there with you.  I knew you were bringing the folks today.  You understand?  He had quite an impact on you.  You came in with some dreads today.  Spitting out your mints.  Wow.  I go, Adam, great you're here.  You're going to save our show today because we don't know what we're doing.  Come on now.  Well, the prep, do they know what you do to prep for this show?  Oh, man. 
[01:12:30]  All right.  Go ahead.  Tell them.  Look at this.  This is a wiffle ball bat.  Now, ask me what this mark is.  We're in the office showing Adam our treasures.  Shouldn't you guys be reading a paper or something?  No, look.  This computer game's called Soldier of Foot.  What?  He's dead.  Look at that.  I just shot him.  Shut up.  They're going to be on to us, man.  We close that door and we make believe we're going through all the newspapers and stuff.  It's the honeycomb hideout out there.  You know what it's like when Adam comes in or any of our friends come in to the office?  We're like great hunters showing off our trophies. 
[01:13:00]  Look at this wiffle ball bat.  This thing was shoved in eight inches deep.  I said, Commander, was it quite a size getting it out?  Quite.  We're like showing trophies.  The wiffle ball bat kills me because there's marks on it like when your kid's growing up  on the door.  Yeah.  That's how you can revisit it.  Remember when you could only take the handle?  Look how much you've grown.  That's our new game.  If any girl out there wants to, you know, try to set the record, you're more than welcome.  What's the record now?  And we do put a condom over the end of it. 
[01:13:30]  So you don't have to worry about getting any of those wiffle ball bat diseases that are  going around now.  Well, the winner is the line that's furthest from the handlebar.  Yeah.  Has there been a pine tar incident?  No, nothing.  Although the last girl that was here, we weren't sure what was going to come out.  Oh, my God.  She had a pimp with her and everything.  Really?  Yeah, she came in under the guise that it was going to be her coming in.  Oh, yeah, this is my boyfriend.  Like, okay, the boyfriend.  It's not usually cool when the boyfriend comes in, but we can deal with it.  And then all of a sudden, the boyfriend, we notice, is this three-foot-tall Puerto Rican 
[01:14:00]  guy.  That's a pimp.  That's a pimp.  And he starts asking for cash.  Wow.  It's like, oh, wait a minute.  Can I ask you a question?  Do you have other girlfriends in your stable?  Huggy man?  He's like, well, yeah.  So it was like a girlfriend in that sense.  It was like a boyfriend would be worse.  Like, hey, hey, handle first.  She's a lady.  Hey, this is my best girl.  I just hit her in the body with the phone book so as not to bruise up her face.  I learned that from Ike Turner.  Oh.  I hit her with a car antenna about her midsection. 
[01:14:30]  This guy was Guido the Killer Pimp.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smack her with a bag of oranges.  A bag of oranges.  Don't leave no marks.  Yeah, sweat sock full of molding clay.  It still feels like a Stretch Armstrong.  Remember those things?  Oh, God.  Those things were like a kid's version of a sap.  You ever see those things like the blackjacks they used to use in Dick Tracy days?  Yeah.  Why the Stretch Armstrong?  The shillelagh.  All right.  The toy Stretch Armstrong, you'd get it for Christmas. 
[01:15:00]  It was cool because you could stretch its arms and legs.  And it felt very soft if you just squished it.  Yeah.  But it was some kind of a physics thing that happened to the material inside during a strong  strike.  So how was I to know when I smashed Dawn over the head with it?  She'd go out.  I thought it was like a marshmallow.  It's a cushy little Stretch Armstrong.  Boom.  Ah.  Boom.  She's out.  You like knocking girls out, man.  Oh, I do?  Well, the taser. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, that was an accident.  The taser incident.  Oh, back up.  It wasn't a taser.  It was a stun gun.  Oh, much better.  That sentence should be, it was a stun gun, your honor.  What did you do with a taser?  Remember Carrie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we were sitting on the couch watching TV one night.  You know how I used to build things.  Right.  Yeah.  So I'd go to Radio Shack and get the plastic cases and transistors, resistors, capacitors,  all kinds of fun stuff.  And I built from this schematic a stun gun. 
[01:16:00]  And I used a...  Oh, wait a minute.  I remember this.  Yeah.  And I used the...  For the contacts, I went to Larry's Hobby Shop and got a couple of landing gear axle for  the airplanes.  And I put that...  I screwed them onto the end of the plastic case.  Everything went on a circuit board, went inside.  But I didn't believe it would work, because I made it.  I figured it would work.  Something would go wrong.  But there's really only one way to test these things.  Honey, stay still.  So we're sitting on the couch, and I stick it to her leg and hit the button. 
[01:16:30]  She goes out.  Pimp.  Pimp.  It's like, oh, wow.  And I was...  I was part...  It was like I was torn, because partly I felt bad for doing that.  But another part of me was like, hey, wow, it worked.  I built it.  You were frightened and impressed.  Yeah.  That's funny.  But I would always...  Remember the grenade launcher you made?  Yeah.  Made a little grenade launcher for the paintball games.  Yeah.  You know?  Remember that? 
[01:17:00]  Well, if you ever left anything at Anthony's house, it would never be in its original form.  Yeah.  I left...  What did I leave?  I left my gun there.  My paintball gun there.  Yeah.  I came back.  I remember calling him up.  Ant, you got my paintball gun?  It's not a gun anymore.  It's a radio.  It's a can of...  What did you do, MacGyver?  Yeah.  Well, now it's like a grenade launcher, and it...  Well, can it core a apple?  I mean, there's all kinds of...  There's even something here to take corns off your feet.  Off your feet.  Shove it a few...  That's funny. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know, I had a lot of time on my hands.  Not working or anything.  You're just very...  You're very intelligent, and you're very drunk.  Yeah, that's what it was.  It's like you can't combine those two.  After a few beers, sitting around, and then just staring around an apartment that was like  Pee Wee's Playhouse.  There was so much stuff laying around, and after a while, you would get tired of toy A and  toy B, so you would combine them to make toy C.  A nitrous oxide-generated spirograph. 
[01:18:00]  It shoots shiny stars at the neighbor's dog.  How much have you had to drink?  Oh, nothing, really.  Nah, we're just getting started.  We're only four tiers high on the coffee table in the living room.  As far as the cans go, the first layer would take up the entire table, and then it would  go up in a pyramid shape, so you reach the top, and then you'd realize the bottom ones  were pretty stinky.  At this point, you'd have to start clearing them out.  And then the bison would pee in the top can, and it would cascade like the champagne thing  at the weddings.  Friend of the bride. 
[01:18:30]  Or we'd sit on the other couch and pick them off with the plastic suction cup dart guns.  Going, ding, ding.  What a bunch of doofus.  Yeah.  Oh, please.  Adam Ferrara helping us out today.  My pal, Adam Ferrara.  Very proud.  Thank you, champ.  Yes.  Oh, they're chanting his name.  Let me follow you and learn your way.  There he is.  Adam Ferrara.  I can heal you.  Luthor.  You guys got to tell that paintball story on the air. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, my God, man.  You're making us laugh pretty damn hard during the commercials.  We were huge into paintball.  When it first started out in Long Island.  Yeah.  When you used to have this single bolt, single shot bolt action paintball gun.  It was a musket.  It was pretty much the musket of paintball guns.  And we went out there.  We were the Red Devils.  Sure.  It was our team.  I still got my jacket.  Who doesn't?  Who doesn't?  Sometimes I like to get naked and put it on.  Yeah.  We were the Red Devils. 
[01:19:30]  The Red Devils.  Yeah.  Had the patch and everything.  People feared the Red Devils, Opie.  Oh, sure.  Mind you.  Did you have a nickname when you were part of the Red Devils?  All of us had our own nicknames.  What was yours?  I was the surgeon.  The surgeon?  The surgeon.  Okay.  That was because I was able to surgically insert shots in between branches and do nose jobs on people.  I broke a guy's nose with a shot.  With a paintball.  And the owner of the field gave me the name The Surgeon.  This guy was behind this log with a bunch of branches in front of him. 
[01:20:00]  Just kind of decimating the team a little bit from a good vantage point.  So I took a shot at him.  It went right between two branches.  Smacked him in the bridge of the nose.  And the next thing, the ambulance was coming, taking him away.  I was like, wait, I thought we were using yellow paint.  How come it's red coming out of his face?  You had sniping skills back then?  Ah, yes.  Yes.  The surgeon, Opie.  So the Red Devils, you guys were quite a team. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Very feared.  Very feared.  We were the number one team in New York.  We went to a bunch of the regional...  And that's where we should have stayed.  Yeah.  We went to a bunch of the regionals all over the state and everything.  Did very well.  Cleaned up.  I think we used a treachery more than skill.  No one expected some of the dumb ass moves we used to make.  We didn't know anything about strategy.  Yeah.  So we'd win.  Well, then we get the call that we're going to this national thing.  Going to the big leagues. 
[01:21:00]  Going to the big leagues in Tennessee.  It's all sponsored and everything.  They send us down to Tennessee.  We're all full of ourselves.  We're going to kick ass.  We're going to wipe everybody out.  We go to Tennessee.  We watched the Dirty Dozen the night before.  Oh, yeah.  We were all psyched.  So we figured, you know, we'll have a little celebratory cocktail or two at a club in Tennessee.  We went in about 11 o'clock at night.  Walked out of there, I think, 3 or 4 in the morning.  Trashed.  They call first game, 7 in the morning. 
[01:21:30]  And guess who's playing first game?  The Red Devils.  The Red Devils are two hours of sleep.  The Drunk Devils.  Right.  Why don't you throw them Yankees out there first?  Yeah.  Put them bars out there first.  And we were playing like the Tennessee team on their home field.  It was the Bay of Pigs.  Oh, it was horrible.  It was a massacre.  No air cover.  It was Da Nang all over again.  It was like General Custer.  Hey, they're friendly Indians.  How long did the game last? 
[01:22:00]  The game must have lasted maybe five minutes at most.  Yeah.  All I know is the horn blew and they were on us so fast.  I didn't even know how fast they could get across the field like that.  So I'm behind a rock.  I see Adam over to the side.  And there's just crap flying all over our heads and everything.  So I'm like, this is useless.  They're just going to outflank us and take us out.  I'm going to stand up and make a bolt fast run toward their flag station. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  And I remember looking and going, Kowalski, no!  Kowalski!  So I stick my head up to stand up.  That was it.  That was it.  I had about 12 shots right into my cranium.  That's all I heard was like, done.  Done, out of it.  I followed after you.  I took it like, because I was running.  When you moved, I was moving behind you to flank around.  Yeah, to help me out.  I went to flank around. 
[01:23:00]  I like two steps.  My whole saw it.  I looked like a subway car.  I was paint graffiti.  Some guys' initials were in there.  It was horrible.  We've got cream.  Take that, Yankee!  Yeah.  They're like, hey, buddy, go back to New York.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They live this.  We're used to playing with what they call live ammunition.  Yeah, that was a militia you guys were.  Well, I think it was.  They nailed us.  We thought we were going on a field to play.  These guys live in the woods.  We're like in his living room. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  So we came back to New York a little more humble.  Hey, one of your old teammates is on the line, eh?  Who's that?  Frankie?  You know a Frankie?  Hey, Frank.  Hello, Anthony.  Frank.  You're doing, brother.  Me and Gallagher.  Oh, yeah.  We went to Tennessee with you guys.  We got cream.  Yeah, you were part of the Tennessee contingent.  Yeah.  We were using bullseye.  It was the worst.  We got nailed.  It was because we went to that club and we were out drinking.  When we were walking in, the other teams were leaving. 
[01:24:00]  They had already been out for their little night in Tennessee.  It was 11 o'clock.  They were going home.  We were just getting there.  We all just got there.  I remember, George, you picked me up from the airport.  I couldn't believe it.  I mean, he heard about it.  I said, I can't believe it.  He was all the red devil.  They caught me for that corner.  And I started playing.  That was the first time I played with that team.  Yeah.  It was great.  Yeah, it was great.  All right.  What a mess.  I was afraid my head was going to be hanging in the mayor's office.  The Annihilators annihilated us. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that's right.  He remembers the team name.  The Annihilators.  We're the Annihilators.  I remember the emergency room.  That's all I remember.  A lot of guys still play.  Oh, do they?  Some of them still play?  Yeah.  We found something else.  A life.  Now, I would love to get out there and actually play again.  We might have to do something when the weather gets really nice.  Yeah, we're trying to get, like, a show paintball team to go.  Well, Corum's still there.  I know, because who was it?  John Cuoco used to run a league way out east, exit 64 in Corum. 
[01:25:00]  Are they still running that?  They're still running, but John's gone.  You know the guy who's there?  John bought it.  He bought it on the Mekong Delta.  Oh, yeah.  He lost it for a while, and the guy should cause his paintball around.  Oh, Cole.  Well, we're going to have to go out there, man.  Yeah, but the equipment's all different now.  It's all automatic, right?  Like Adam said, it was pretty much the musket of paintball guns.  And then we got to the point where they put a pump on it, and you were amazed.  And then constant air came out.  And then full automatic, where you are firing paintballs at a rate that is ridiculous. 
[01:25:30]  And now that's with, like, that standard equipment now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guns they have now are computers.  You plug them into your computer, and a program is called Angel.  It's like $1,600.  A computerized gun.  You could take out people in the car on the way to the game.  You just hit it.  It's right in your radio.  Doesn't that take the fun out of the game?  It's amazing.  You know something?  And this just goes to show you, because this is paintball.  But the same principles apply to warfare, where it just advances and progresses. 
[01:26:00]  We're talking over the course of probably maybe 10, 12 years, I guess it was, since we were playing.  And the technology that they put behind these guns now is amazing.  It was a single-shot gun.  And the purpose for the original guns that they started paintball with was to mark trees that they were going to cut down.  They'd go into these building sites and use a red paintball.  And so they wouldn't have to get out of the truck and paint a thing. 
[01:26:30]  They would shoot it.  And then, you know, Arlo and Clem, one day, Clem shoots Arlo in the ass with the paint gun.  It's like, hey, we're hunting something here.  And there's a game where, a few years later, they're plugging it into the computer and calling in airstrikes.  And those two guys are the guys we played in Tennessee.  I think so.  We invented this game.  Yeah, I remember that.  Ant, this just in.  Joe from Jersey wants to know, does Anthony still have that jacket, or did he lose that also?  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me think now.  Uh-oh.  Hey, I think some homeless guy in Huntington is walking around with my Red Devil's jacket. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, God.  I think it's in the Goodwill box.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Great.  Hey, you remember a team called the Court Jesters?  Yeah.  Scott Schmidt, Brian Morgan.  Remember the Jesters?  Yeah, the Jesters.  We always had that rivalry going on with you guys.  Yeah.  Oh, you were on that team?  Yeah, I was on for about a year.  And I was still underage at the time. 
[01:27:30]  I was like 16, 17.  They didn't check nothing.  A fresh-faced rookie.  Yeah, it was great, though.  And then you had the other team, the Wild Geese, the old guys.  The Wild Geese, the old guys.  Yeah, those guys were all Vietnam vets.  The Wild Geese.  I don't understand how they played, because once you go into service, it takes away from it.  Yeah, the Wild Geese were all vets.  I remember one time they pulled this little raid.  They actually got a raft and got into the lake and paddled across the lake.  No one did crap like that. 
[01:28:00]  It was hysterical.  We used to use some treachery that was pretty funny.  If we were the red team, you'd have to wear a red bandana around your arm, and the other  team would wear a yellow one.  So if we were crouched down in ambush or something, we'd see an opposing team member walking by.  We'd roll over to hide our bandana and go to him,  Hey, dude, come here.  We need help.  Come here.  Come here.  And he'd start crawling towards you.  And you'd just open up on his face.  Well, that's because our devil patches were red.  Yeah, so if we were the yellow team, they might see a red patch and think it was the red. 
[01:28:30]  It was hysterical.  We would take over the flag station and then just make believe that they would come back  with our flag.  Come on, come on.  We're going to win.  And they'd come running.  Da-da-da-da.  They'd leave people back to defend their station while they sent out a force to get our flag.  Right.  So if they captured our flag, we would take over their flag station, get down in the bunkers,  and while the guy was running in, we're like,  Come on, we won, we won.  The second he gets ready to place the flag,  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, he just opened up on his face.  Say hello to my little friend.  But you cheated. 
[01:29:00]  You said that you were our team.  You cheated.  Yeah, pop.  Take that with you.  Tell that to the Viet Cong.  Remember the Mickey Mouse massacre?  Oh, that was great.  We actually sang the theme to the Mickey Mouse Club while we were just mowing down people.  We were taking this hill singing this song.  It was embarrassing to the people.  And you know who was on the Wild Geese?  John McCain.  John McCain.  You guys are talking my language.  Joe, what was your code name? 
[01:29:30]  Joe Buck.  Joe Buck.  Hey, listen.  Adam was Finster.  Yeah, my brother was pretty sick.  We'd surround a flag station.  There would be a bunch of the opposing team dug in into these bunkers that were set up.  And we'd all be around it trying to fire in.  Joe would always lead the charge.  He would just stand up and run right into these bunkers.  And from like two inches away, pop these guys.  And I'd be amazed. 
[01:30:00]  Like, what the hell is he doing?  And the people were so stunned that he did it that they couldn't even shoot him.  They're looking at him like.  And their first reaction was to cover up their face so they wouldn't even shoot him.  And he'd just stand over and go, pop, pop, pop.  It was hysterical.  Remember that movie, Dogs of War?  Yeah, Christopher Walken.  You're late.  In a couple of seconds, you felt like Chris Walken when he walked into the presidential palace.  With that friggin' gun he had.  Oh, yeah, totally crazy.  The street sweeper. 
[01:30:30]  I started getting us into doing the camouflage and everything.  Yeah, Joe would have like.  The uniforms.  Because Joe was in the Army, you know.  So he would put on the same face camo that he put on when he was with the 82nd Airborne.  And it would just scare the bejesus out of the newbies.  Newbies show up in like corduroys and a t-shirt.  We're dressed like Sandinista.  He showed up in no shirt.  Remember Rambo that time?  Oh, yeah, we were calling him Rambo.  He showed up in no shirt.  No shirt.  The guy looked like a leopard when he was done.  He had just welts all over his body. 
[01:31:00]  That was a challenge.  Everyone was going, oh, I'm getting the left shoulder.  Gotta get this guy, man.  Gotta get this guy.  He looked like the strippers from yesterday.  And after we did him up with wax.  With the wax.  Yeah.  And Joe, the best was this thing called the Recon Village.  It was the smallest field on the whole collection of fields they had.  It was hoochies.  A bunch of bunkers and houses and huts made out of plywood and whatnot.  With windows and doors cut in.  And this field was really small. 
[01:31:30]  So it was all headshots.  Everything was a headshot.  Someone would peek out a window.  Wham!  Just right in the head.  And then remember one of the crazy Vietnam guys from the Wild Geese?  He ran and jumped through a window, landed on his head, and then got taken out by the guy inside.  He went running across the field and he went to dive into one of the open windows of the hooch.  And they were just plywood.  They were just made of plywood.  And he caught his head like halfway across his forehead on the top of the window. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, that's what happened to that guy.  Joe Buck, when he used to raid the bunkers, he was like, because he had the paint and everything, he was really in the service.  He would go nuts after he shot people.  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, not give me your wallet!  Oh, Jason from Bethpage checking in on instant feedback.  Did you ever play the Big East game with 500 guys and helicopters?  Yes, we did.  Yes, we did.  Uh-oh.  What?  They would do this once a year.  It was called the Big Game.  They would get about 500 people, divvy them up into two teams, and there would be helicopters where they would take these certain insertion teams over the field and drop them at locations. 
[01:32:30]  But when you have 250 guys against 250 firing off at each other, when you would get into these huge line battles that were about 100 people across, and it would just sound like New Year's Day in China.  Yeah.  Remember when you used to be able to call it an anthracite, too?  Yeah, you could call it an airstripe on your walkie-talkie. 
[01:33:00]  This is a guy with a can of Dutch boy paint just dropping it out the side.  And John Cuoco, don't shoot at the helicopters!  Don't shoot at the choppers!  You take one of those old things down with a paintball.  This guy would walk around like Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now with his cane and his cowboy hat and everything.  And he wore his colors and everything.  He was another Vietnam vet.  They were all like nom vets.  That's funny.  What about when Rick Schroeder was on the field?  Oh, God, I forgot about that.  Oh, the bachelor party thing.  Rick, Ricky Schroeder. 
[01:33:30]  I forgot about that, yeah.  He was a bigger target than Rambo.  And everybody was just like, oh, yeah, I want to nail Ricky Schroeder.  Here he goes.  I got your silver spoon.  I'm going to get...  He was like a big target.  We've got to get out there, man.  Yeah, we've got to get something together.  I'm frightened with all the technology and stuff.  You better, like, hold up in the apartment for a while and build something.  I built a tank.  What was that?  Last time I played, they have constant air, which is a CO2 pack on your back, and constant  feed, balls. 
[01:34:00]  You get like a thousand at a time.  And it's semi-auto.  You just, as fast as you pull the trigger, that's how fast the gun fires.  Yeah, I'm going to go back there.  Well, did you hear the other guy talking now?  You could plug your gun into a computer and computerized, I guess, velocity.  Look at Joe.  Joe's having an orgasm.  You know, maybe our time has passed, guys.  Yeah, really.  Maybe we're a little too old for this crap.  No, we want to do some type of...  My buddy goes, do you want to do some ecstasy?  I'm like, I can't even have dairy. 
[01:34:30]  I'm not doing ecstasy.  That's true.  Oh, God.  All right, Joe.  Adam, give me a call, man.  I will.  All right, brother.  Cool.  Take it easy, Joe.  A lot of great phone calls on hold, Anthony.  They're going to talk about the new technology and these paintball wars.  Yeah, a couple of people from the old team checking in.  All right.  Pretty cool.  Where's Laird?  Did he call in?  Oh, God.  Jim Laird.  Get Laird to call in.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is... 
[01:35:00]  This station, 1027 WNEW, New York.  Opie and Anthony, 1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027.  He's been waiting for like 10 minutes, Anthony.  Yes.  To say hi.  It's been a very, very long time.  I believe over a month.  I'm over here now.  We got to check in with the legend. 
[01:35:30]  I'm over here now.  Andrew, Dice, Clay.  What are you doing?  Hello.  Hey.  Hey, Dice.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, na-na.  Hey, what are you doing there?  Hey.  What's going on?  Is this Dice cool?  No, this is just me now.  Oh, okay.  It's just the regular Dice.  I never know who's on the phone.  This is like Dice Mild.  Dice Mild.  Yes.  We really haven't talked to you since you went back to L.A. after the Garns show.  I know.  And you're never home.  No. 
[01:36:00]  You're a whole big shot now.  No, just very busy.  We had to get a lot of our guys out of jail.  No, I heard about that.  I got the call.  You did?  The team's one of us?  Yeah, Norton called me from jail.  Oh, by the way, thank you so much for turning us on to Jim Norton.  He's fun, right?  You are so effing right.  The guy is a blast.  You know, he's got issues.  A few.  Yeah.  You know, not like me.  No, I thought the issues with Jim Norton was an act.  It's not an act.  No, no, I'm telling you something.  The guy is out of his effing mind.  No, the call I got from him. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  You know, he goes, you know, he calls me up.  He goes, Dice, you know, he told me about the bus.  I told you guys you were going to get in trouble with these little girls.  What?  Teens?  I told you.  Teens.  Who told you months ago?  Yeah, you were a little pissed at us when we were.  You know what I mean?  We were going down that teen road.  You know what I mean?  This is a, you know, it's a lot of laughs.  Yeah.  You know, behind closed doors where nobody could see it.  Hey, they were 15.  You know what I mean?  What's the problem?  So he calls me from jail.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  You know, and he, you know, he's telling me he's in jail for this.  Yeah.  You know, which is where I feel he belongs anyway.  Right.  Yeah.  For the things he does.  He said.  You know, and he goes, I'm just sitting in the corner leaking fluid.  He was talking about like, oh, what did he say?  It was a great line.  He would lick the helmet for a puff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't have cigarettes.  Yeah.  But he meant it.  No, I know he didn't.  Yeah.  We know that now about him.  Yeah.  What else has he told you?  Because I don't want to talk about things that he doesn't talk about. 
[01:37:30]  Well, there's the hookers and the urine thing.  The urine.  Yeah.  Did you ever hear the toasting with urine?  The what?  Did you ever hear that story?  Which one?  Oh, what is it?  What is it?  What is it?  The toasting?  He was just out here.  He did a gig with me at the Sun Theater in Anaheim.  Yeah.  And on the way back, he decided to tell us another story of royalty.  Uh-huh.  You know.  Yeah.  Where he's with this girl as he's driving back from some gig in Jersey. 
[01:38:00]  And she's like, I don't know.  Once again, I'm stuck.  Because to the radio, she's giving him, as he would say, oral treats.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  There we go.  That's a Norton word.  Oral treats.  But the thing about these oral treats is she can't pick her head up because she's under  the steering wheel.  Yeah.  She likes that.  She likes it that way.  Yeah.  That's what he told me.  All right.  And I'm going, all right.  That's half normal.  You know.  And then he goes, but the beauty of it is, as she's doing that to me, I'm drinking 
[01:38:30]  out of a wine glass.  Oh, my God.  Get that out of here.  You know, like.  He likes that.  Yeah.  He likes that.  And, uh.  Wait, wait.  If Norton's listening, he has to call up to confirm that.  That is out there.  That's out there.  He'll confirm it.  He'll confirm.  So, you know, me and, uh, you know, you remember Todd, the guy with the cap.  He looks like one of Santa's helpers.  Yeah.  You remember him.  Of course.  So, we're both sitting there going, can't you get sick from that?  Yeah, you would think.  You know, you know, because we only thought he likes to be that sound. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, that's good.  That was good.  That got it through.  Golden Shown.  But now he's talking about drinking it like it's Tom Perrione, you know.  And we're going, can't you get sick from that?  And he's going, no, I just sip it.  Like, like, like if he gulped it, he would get sick.  Right.  Oh, so just sipping it.  You know, if you sip it, it goes in slow and everything's good.  Some things are like that, though.  No, no.  But you're getting rid of all those bad toxins when you squirt one out like that. 
[01:39:30]  God.  I hear it's very healthy to.  I try to talk to him because I'm more normal than that.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Well, you don't like.  I try to say, you know, you're a young guy now and you do these crazy things.  But if you don't stop, you know, once you hit like 40 or something, you're going to want  to blow your brains out after thinking about what you've been doing the last 20 years.  Did he tell you the one with the two girls when he's, you know, preparing the sap sock?  And I'm trying to use radio technology. 
[01:40:00]  The sap sock is good.  I like sap sock.  No, no.  You know what I mean.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And you're the sap sock.  It's, you know, he's preparing it.  And he keeps getting a call from another guy going, are you ready?  Are you ready?  And then two girls come in and it wasn't like a shower.  It was like torrential rains, he said.  You know, it was like the greatest gift he could ever get.  Yeah.  This is what he likes.  He likes the kinky stuff.  And this is the guy that's been my opening act for three years and hanging around my kids. 
[01:40:30]  How smart am I?  How smart are you?  You let him hang around your kids?  No, he's actually, he's nice with children.  Yeah, he's nice with children.  All right.  You should have seen him on the Teen Buzz.  Hey, we got Jim Norton checking in.  Oh, we got him.  Okay.  All right.  Jimmy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Norton.  How's it going, Andrew?  We're talking about a few things here that we wanted to clear with you.  Okay, I haven't been listening.  I was actually, I just woke up a little while ago.  What's going on?  Yeah, I know.  Life of a comic.  Yeah, I'm just a loser.  Dice, allow me. 
[01:41:00]  Norton, he was telling a cute little story.  You're coming back from a gig from Jersey.  I don't even know where you bother showing.  A girl is nibbling on your hog, let's say.  Uh-huh.  But she likes to have her head under the steering wheel.  Yes.  So she can't get her head up.  Yes.  And what were you doing while this was happening?  Probably tickling my nipples.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, wait.  Wait, I'll leave a...  Oh, you're...  Oh, that's years ago.  That's like six years ago.  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't just casually say that like it's normal.  You do the...  You do that? 
[01:41:30]  No, I just did it to be silly.  I don't know.  That's pretty silly.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes you're in a goofy mood.  You're like, ah, why not?  So I did it.  Yeah, but why do you think you can't get sick from that?  Um, I don't know.  It hasn't happened yet.  I mean, obviously it was quite a few years ago, so I'm okay.  But I really didn't think at the moment.  Yeah, but have you done it since?  Uh, not like that, no.  I'm like, you know...  What do you mean not like that?  Well, he had a wine glass.  He takes it right out of his tap now.  Yeah, I think there might be contaminants in the cup.  Yeah, you don't want to get sick for maybe the cup not being washed. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, exactly.  There may have been coffee in there earlier.  I forgot what I had in there earlier.  So you were really sipping it out of a wine glass?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I was actually, I believe, a paper cup.  I don't remember.  Oh, my God.  All I remember...  But it was a wine glass, you told me.  It very well may have been.  If I told you that, then that's what it was.  If it was a jet mug, who cares?  Well, now you're saying paper cup.  Warren, what I do...  You know, not a whole story could be a lie.  Well, now believe me, I never lie about a tinkle drink to drinking.  But one thing I do remember, though, is what's going to my mind while this is happening  is, like, what happened to my life that I'm enjoying this? 
[01:42:30]  And you enjoyed it.  Well, I guess so, yeah.  Norton.  Yes, sir.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't I talk to you all the time?  What's that?  Don't I talk to you all the time about, like, these crazy things you do?  Yeah, I know.  You always try to mellow me out.  You do.  Yeah, that, like, you know, normal sex, like, just to a...  As I said earlier, to take your sap sock and bang it against some chick's ass, that's  a normal thing.  You know what I mean?  Right.  You know, as you bury the mule in her pinot pocket. 
[01:43:00]  Well, I do enjoy doing that as well.  Yeah.  But that's, like, normal.  All right.  Yeah.  The idea of sex is something completely different.  But to clean you up, getting cleaned up after is like a nice shower or a bed.  You don't have her, uh, uh, urinate all over you to clean everything up.  I know.  After sex, I smell like an alley.  God damn, man.  Norton.  Yeah, sir.  I mean, right.  We got about...  Don't you think that's going to dement you in the long run?  It probably...  I mean, I imagine it's not emotionally healthy, but... 
[01:43:30]  Why do you think he twitches so much?  I know.  I got problems.  I tried it, though.  That's normal.  Norton, Norton, Norton.  Now you're picking on a confliction.  Hold on.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, that's a confliction.  You don't make fun of people's conflictions, you know, when people limp or, uh, they twitch.  You know, that's a good...  That's a normal, like, uh, you know, a little confliction he's got.  Right.  All right.  Wait, let me in on this here.  Norton.  Yes.  What's the turn on with the urine?  I...  You know what?  It's not even...  It wasn't even the urine.  It was just the idea that I was doing something so awful. 
[01:44:00]  Just so wrong.  And that...  It's like naughty.  That got you going.  Yeah, just beyond naughty.  And it wasn't...  You know, it was just a thing.  I don't know why I did it.  You know, you do silly things sometimes.  Like I said, you know, once in a while you're feeling kind of kooky.  So, you know, you do something different.  Silly is like...  But that's not normal.  That's right.  You know, this is a guy that goes to dinner at Morton's and goes,  Yeah, give me the steak, a baked potato, and, uh, what do I want to drink?  Uh, give me a bottle of...  Yeah, well, no, I don't have it with dinner, ever, ever.  Never with dinner.  That's disgusting and tasteless.  Only during...  Right.  Norton. 
[01:44:30]  Yes, sir?  That's bizarre, man.  Silly is like, you know, you're on, like, a public bus and you're moon, maybe.  Silly's not, like, drinking s***.  I don't know.  I just kind of thought I fell into the classification of silly.  You may be correct.  Can you tell the story, um, that you told us backstage at the Dice Show at the Garden?  Which one was that?  Where, um, um, a couple ladies gave you the golden shower.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I tried that.  But they were kind of related to you or not related?  That's the one I told you.  Oh, no, they weren't related.  They weren't family members, no.  That's the one I told you when he was preparing it. 
[01:45:00]  Not family, but what was the story?  My friend's girlfriend?  Yeah.  And her friend?  Yeah, well, they were out drinking and partying all night, so they told me that they were  going to do it.  And I figured, okay, it'll be fun to do.  Why not?  It's a weekend.  But I had to prepare, so I had to lay towels down in the living room, because they were coming  home and they'd been holding it for, like, 20 minutes.  Nice.  And my roommate called me and goes, all right, Jim, look, we're 10 minutes away.  You've got to get yourself started.  Like, start whacking my bag so I'm prepared when they come in, because there was no prep  time, because they had to go.  So two girls walk in, I'm laying on the living room floor, whacking my bag, and they did it. 
[01:45:30]  Although I didn't get any in the face, though, because they were...  That was all neck work, right?  What's that?  Tell them where.  Oh, yeah, oh, she was jetting it into my neck?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, there's a little...  You know how you lay on your back, there's a little, like, hole in your neck?  Right.  Yeah, well, it was in there, and it was really causing quite a ruckus.  You liked that.  And you're naked, and your friend walks in with the two girls?  Well, he was parking the vehicle.  But he would have.  I didn't care if he did.  We just would have giggled about it later.  Now, you know... 
[01:46:00]  That's the word giggled.  Yeah.  You would have giggled about it?  That's what we would have done.  Giggled about what?  Just the whole experience and the silliness of it all.  That's something people do between five and ten years in prison for.  You did 28 hours.  Well, that wasn't really illegal, what I did.  I mean, it's not illegal, is it?  Yeah, but, you know, now you're taking it onto the freeways where people could be driving  with their kids.  No, no, it's in the living room.  Norton, Norton, Norton.  A lot of people want to back up to that story where the girl's, you know, nibbling on your  hog, her head's under the steering wheel, and you're sipping your own... 
[01:46:30]  Norton, tell me...  Not my own.  Wait a minute.  It was hers?  Yeah.  That would be sick if it was his own.  Oh, excuse me.  Oh, my God, no.  I'm not shipwrecked.  I'm not shipwrecked.  Tell me the part where the girl likes her head under the wheel because she can't get  her head out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a girl dated years ago.  In between the...  How do you make a turn?  Well, I wasn't driving.  I would park the vehicle in a quiet, deserted air.  No, I would never drive like that.  Oh, I thought you were driving on the freeway.  No, no, I've received oral treats while driving, but no, no, there's never any real dominance 
[01:47:00]  when that's happening because I'm too worried about traffic and being pulled over.  All right, just to get off of that story for a minute.  Yeah.  Tell them the hooker story where you drove home with your hand out the window for an hour  and a half in the freezing cold.  Oh, God, that was awful.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  I'm focused on that.  I'd tell a story about that.  Do you really?  This is absolutely true.  The first...  I lost my...  Well, no, it was my first girlfriend, actually.  No, this wasn't his first.  No, no, no, no, no.  Wait, did you have the same thing I had happen? 
[01:47:30]  She...  She...  How do you say it without them dumping out?  Stunk.  Stunk.  Thank you.  And it was so bad.  I was driving home from Geneseo for Thanksgiving, and for the whole seven-hour car ride, I had my  hand out the window.  Well, you were in the front area, correct?  What is where the odor was coming from?  Yeah, that's what he said.  All right, all right, wait, I just...  Without even knowing what you were about to say, I just started dry heaving.  Yeah, and believe me, it's not an enchanting story.  Holy ass. 
[01:48:00]  No, no, he goes...  He goes for, um...  But...  I don't have a word for it.  It was just...  It was a lady of the evening who looked like she...  She asked me if I wanted company, and I'm like, wow, that sounds terrific.  Thank you.  So she got in.  I thought, and she's performing oral treats on me.  Very well, I might add.  And I'm rubbing her...  Exactly.  I'm rubbing her cheeks.  You know, because, again, I don't put fingers in.  That's just...  You know, it's just a little too weird.  I know.  What he does...  Let me explain what he does.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We got a yield sign here. 
[01:48:30]  What?  Just...  Just...  We want all this on the radio, so just kind of talk around and talk at home and stuff.  Yeah.  Okay, well, you know how you sniff flowers?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like beautiful roses?  Yeah.  Right.  Well, this wasn't that face you make.  It wasn't quite like that because I was in the driver's seat relaxing, and let's just  say that the other person was doing something for a fee that I was finding enjoyable.  And sometimes you, you know how you relax and you put your hand on somebody's hip when 
[01:49:00]  they're doing things for a fee, and you know, there's a couple of little cheeks there  and you'll just pat them gently.  Well, once in a while, people are not quite hygienic in certain backdoor areas.  Right.  And you may remove your fingers and find something that resembles butterscotch pudding.  Check.  Check, please.  I'm out of here.  And then when driving home...  Waitress, I'll take the check.  Then when driving home in January, despite the cold, you realize it is more pleasant to  hang your pudding-covered finger out the window than have it in the vehicle. 
[01:49:30]  Butterscotch pudding!  Something tells me it didn't have the fragrance or flavor of butterscotch pudding.  Not at all.  But the consistency was there.  Apparently, she had the flu.  All right.  Listen, listen.  Listen, Norton.  I'm going to be able to cut it out.  That could be the most disgusting thing we've ever heard.  How do you think I felt?  I paid to have that.  So I had a dirty hand and less money.  Oh, good.  Wow.  Good.  Now, you said you didn't really get by the... 
[01:50:00]  No, he's telling you the clean stuff.  What?  Norton, you said...  He's telling you the clean stories.  You said you didn't really get by the exact exit.  So this stuff was lurking around the area?  Well, sometimes you'll see an exit and you'll stop very briefly and just look and go, nah,  and then keep going.  Right.  But by that time, there's already...  Like, say there's been an oil spill on the ground at the exit and you realize that your  vehicle has picked up some of that oil spill.  Right.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  It's always nice to give an analogy like that that you can do over the radio.  I'm so thirsty with myself. 
[01:50:30]  What's that dice?  We're talking about cars?  No, not really, no.  No, you've lost me now, because it's like...  One minute you're talking about, you know, pudding.  Somehow this girl got pudding stuck on her rear.  Uterscotch pudding.  All right, listen, listen.  Uterscotch pudding.  The listeners are going nuts.  People are just calling up saying, I'm retching, I'm puking, cut it out, stop.  Yeah, see, that's not a good image for me. 
[01:51:00]  Well, how do you think I feel?  I mean, these are just stories that are getting nauseous.  This is my life.  Did that even wash off?  Yeah, believe me, it did.  I had that Purell stuff in the car that you clean your hands with, that wouldn't even do  the trick.  Like acetone or something.  I don't know what she eats, but I wish she would change her diet, because that was extraordinarily  unprecedented.  What, are you going to see her again?  No, I hope she's dead as we speak.  I don't know her name.  But I don't care for her at all.  That's not a good attitude.  That's amazing.  That was very icky.  How are you not aware of that?  Well, he says, like, when he's doing a, like, sniff routine, the flower sniff. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  Like, even if it's a little taut, right?  Right.  Of course, he's got to stay in there, because you've got to be a team player.  Yeah, you've got to be a good guy.  You've got to be a team player.  What are you going to do?  Even if it's a little, like, taut or, like, tarnish, you know what I mean?  Taut.  What are you going to do?  What's that noise?  If it's the fourth quarter, and your team is down by three, and your uniform's a little  dirty, you can't just go, hey, I've got to sit on the bench. 
[01:52:00]  You've got to be a good guy.  Yeah, I'm a good guy.  I care about people, and that's the way I deal with things.  I don't want to embarrass somebody.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Oh, some guy's saying he can probably still smell it under his fingernail.  No, no, no, believe me.  I washed quite thoroughly.  I was like an obsessive-compulsive, and I could not stop washing my hands.  And then everything smells fine, and then an hour later, you go back and go, oh, God,  it's back.  Well, it's like a bad car, actually.  You just can't stop sniffing, even though you know it's going to be horrendous. 
[01:52:30]  You just keep sniffing.  Yeah, he taught me to sniff, though.  It's not out of pleasant, though.  The sniff that I told you about was out of pleasantries, and, like, everybody's having a good  time, and I'm glad to be alive.  So that thing I do when I perform, that face?  Yeah, it's just that perfect, awful face, yeah.  It's disgusting.  Dominic on line 10, suggesting that Norton, he should have poured gasoline on your hand.  That might have worked.  You know what?  I can't disagree with that.  I can't disagree with that.  Because it was disgusting, and I was not happy with myself. 
[01:53:00]  And when you were in jail, did anything happen with these girls?  No, no, no, no.  I got no vibes whatsoever.  What about the call you gave me?  No, how about that one girl?  That was on the bus.  Melanie.  No, no, but you said you were in jail, and there was a fluid leak.  Oh, no, I was leaking fluid?  We've got to use all car references now.  No, no, no, I was, because I was sitting across from them, and we mentioned this on  the air yesterday, and they were, like, just sitting, and I was looking at the legs, and  you know, occasionally a little fellow will pick up a skirt because it's the right thing  to do, and when that happens, you start leaking fluid. 
[01:53:30]  It's a natural thing, but nothing happened, though.  Oh, my God.  I was cuffed to my chair, just wishing I was dead, and that was...  Did I have one free hand to pinch your helmet?  I'm sorry?  Did I have one free hand to do a little helmet pinching?  I did have a free hand.  A helmet pinching would have been a bit obvious with the police officers and chiefs, so I felt  the little shaft rubbing was more appropriate, just discreetly, when no one was looking.  How'd you do that?  Just through the trouser.  A little shaft rubbing through the trouser.  He speaks, like, eloquently. 
[01:54:00]  Notice he doesn't say pants.  Right.  He doesn't say trousers.  Well, you know, I don't want to be tasteless.  He knows all the dialogue.  All right, you sick, sick sons of bitches.  Dan from Hoboken, butterscotch pudding, why can't Earl bring down the fader on that one?  What does that mean, bring down the fader?  Earl had a little problem earlier in the show.  Yeah.  What was the problem?  Bringing down a fader that...  Guys, I think we've got to let you go, because we're all puking and trying to...  Yeah, this has really gotten a little disgusting. 
[01:54:30]  Wonderful.  Yeah, I call up for a nice call, and this is what goes on.  See what happened?  I apologize.  I was just in the living room smoking.  All right, we've got to let you guys go.  Okay, thanks, Guy.  I'll talk to you soon.  All right.  Andrew, I'll talk to you later.  All right, goodbye.  Take care, guys.  Thank you, Jim.  Bye.  And, Dice, we've got to let you go.  We're very busy today.  Dice just hung up.  Oh, he hung up.  All right.  And Jim just hung up.  That's cool.  That was a good break.  There you go.  Good break with Dice.  Nice.  Nice.  First time we've heard from him since the garden gig.  All right, Ant, let's take a break, regroup. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Get the bad taste out of our mouths.  And we'll move on.  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  The O&A show beats the hell out of my dad's old pornos.  1-2-7-W-A-W.  Next guest.  Hold on, next guest.  Hold on.  We just need a little music for him before we pop down the phone line. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  You never know who's going to call the radio show, Anthony.  Let's get him up here.  Hey, Jim Cux.  Jim Cux from Sam Adams.  Hey, guys.  There he is.  Uh-oh.  I think I'm about to be embarrassed again.  No.  Hold on a second, Jim.  Hold on.  Your music is playing.  Looking for adventure in whatever comes by me.  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, darling, go and make it happen.  No.  Sophie, you're terrible.  All right, let's take a night.  Hey, I'm in a thunder.  Listen.  Hurry up, Dick.  Get out of the car.  Fuck it off, Dick.  That's your own spot. 
[01:56:30]  That's your own spot.  The world in a loving place.  Bow to the back of the bus.  It's not to speak.  Well, Jim.  Yes.  Hey, Ed.  Now, I was just informed that you had a little bit of a little bit of an accident.  Yeah.  It was one of those stupid things you do when you're sober.  But I never hurt myself drinking.  You guys know that.  No, of course not.  It's only when you're sober that you get into trouble. 
[01:57:00]  That's true.  It's coming right for us.  That is true.  Now, I know you, Jim.  You love drinking your wonderful Sam Adams.  But you have people drive you around when you're drinking Sam Adams.  Yeah, usually.  And, uh, now, you were on a motorcycle.  No, I wish it was on a motorcycle.  It was a weenie mountain bike.  No, it wasn't a real bike.  So it was a bicycle.  It was a weenie little bicycle. 
[01:57:30]  Hey, this wrecks our whole fit, Jim.  I know.  I know.  I didn't have a leather jacket.  I just had those stupid little tight pants.  Oh, no.  It wasn't a real helmet.  You know, it was one of those little lightweight bike helmets.  Well, this was an embarrassing way to break a few ribs and crack my hand.  Faggot.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  You're on a bicycle.  It looked like I was in a Cherry Hill mall or something.  Bling, bling, bling, bling.  Look out.  Bling, bling. 
[01:58:00]  Bling, bling.  So you're riding your bicycle.  Walk us through what happened, Jim.  Well, you know, Boston.  I was riding around the Charles River on that bike path.  It was like 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning, really early.  It was Sunday morning.  Beautiful day.  River beautiful.  And I'm riding along.  And the next thing I know, I'm on the ground.  My bike's there.  My helmet's cracked.  And I'm like, wow, I should have had a beer. 
[01:58:30]  This is going to hurt pretty soon.  What did you hit?  You know, I have no idea.  I got a concussion.  Wait a minute.  You're just riding, and then all of a sudden, you're off your bike.  Yeah.  No recollection.  It was not a drug flashback.  No.  I was completely sober.  Like, I think the only thing that could happen like that is one of those little guy wires  that come down from the telephone poles.  Yeah.  If you hit that with your throat.  Either that or, like, you're just hanging in, like, you know, when your pants get stuck  in the chain, you don't realize, and all of a sudden, you're like, ah, ah, garbage  tail. 
[01:59:00]  You know, one of the worst kind of bicycle accidents were also, remember the one, I saw  a couple of girls did this years and years ago when I was a kid.  They were riding, one girl riding the bike, the other one on the handlebars with her feet  dangling.  Her foot got in the spokes.  Oh.  Comes against the fork.  Her foot just gets creamed, and the bike does the header.  Oh, that's a bad thing.  And the bike does the header.  Yeah.  But I heard Dolly Parton was riding a bike and hit a bump and gave herself two black  eyes.  But on bump, there you go, Jim. 
[01:59:30]  Stick to making me.  All right.  Now, Jim, so you're laying on the ground.  Yeah.  You got a concussion.  What else?  What other injuries?  I broke two ribs.  I broke my hand.  So I got a cast on.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I mean, I should stick to the drinking.  Did you have those dopey tight bicycle pants on, so you're just laying there with your junk  just hanging out?  Yes.  It was really embarrassing when the paramedics came.  And they hauled you away?  Did they know who you were? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  I told them when I was in the ambulance.  And the guy's, wow, can I get some free beer?  He didn't care.  I could have had, you know, paralyzed from the neck down.  Yeah.  Can I come to the brewery and pick up some beer?  Hey, I got audio of the emergency workers.  Oh, yeah?  They came upon Jim, and this is what they had to say.  Walk it off, dick.  That's got to hurt.  It was bad.  Yeah.  I have a passerby that saw it happen.  Yeah.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[02:00:30]  Really?  This was a guy in a cab, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Man.  You are one pathetic loser.  That was not a really dignified way to break a couple of ribs.  Oh, Jesse Jackson giving him some advice.  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes!  Yeah.  I wasn't even looking for empties or anything.  No!  Don't! 
[02:01:00]  But you're feeling better, Jim?  Yeah.  Yeah, I actually had a couple of beers.  I felt a lot better.  Well, you know something?  Your fine Sam Adams makes any pain go away.  It worked.  It actually worked.  I forgot about the concussion and the broken ribs.  Yeah.  And life was pretty good again.  Hey, Anthony.  I want you to bang your junk up.  No, that was okay.  You hit that curve, and the back wheel just pops up, and you're jumping.  Oh, yeah.  Blah!  No, it hits your taint.  Oh.  Taint.  Oh, God.  You can't even cry.  You just go...  The taint injury. 
[02:01:30]  I did get him to put a bottle opener in the cast.  Oh, really?  I have a built-in bottle opener on my cast.  You can just open bottles at your cast.  Yeah, I feel like Captain Hook.  You know, I can't use my hand, but I can use this bottle opener.  Taint off!  That's handy.  Yeah.  Otherwise, it would have been really desperate.  I would have started opening my teeth.  Oh, we had Jim Cook right as he was crashing.  Sweet, merciful crap! 
[02:02:00]  I wish.  And another ambulance worker.  What the hell were you thinking?  Oh, no.  Is this true?  This guy was walking right by the accident scene?  Your balls are showing.  That's awful.  Oh, Jim.  It was completely embarrassing.  Hey, one of the brothers from Dorchester.  You got locked the f*** up! 
[02:02:30]  That was a lefty up.  Our brewery's right by those guys.  Those guys would have helped me out.  Look at me localizing for Boston, too.  Yeah, that is very good.  All right, Jim.  Well, I'm glad to hear you're okay.  Yeah, I'm delighted you guys call up with all this sympathy.  You know, next time you could just send flowers, it would be okay. 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  This is how we show our love.  You know that.  Yeah.  More audio of Jim Cook after the accident.  There you go.  Well, I'm glad you guys weren't in the ambulance.  I'm over here now.  Yeah, let me step on his nuts.  And, of course, Jim's saying,  Ouch!  That had to hurt.  You know, I don't think he was thinking clearly after the accident.  Really?  Why, Opie? 
[02:03:30]  Listen to this.  I need to go pooping!  That's awful.  There's no room in those shorts.  I guess not.  You can't do that.  Yeah, well...  Well, Jim...  I think your time in the barrel's just about up, and you did pretty well.  Take care of yourself.  Hold on, this guy wants it.  No more bicycling.  Rich, what's up?  Where's Rich?  We lost Rich.  Okay.  Did he go away?  Did you damage... 
[02:04:00]  Craig wants to know...  Did you...  Craig wants to know, Jim, if you damage the basket on the front of your bike.  The basket.  With the little sunflower that's curled up.  And the little tassels hanging from the handlebars.  Ring, ring.  All right.  Well, Jim, you take care.  Have a beer for us.  All right.  All right.  We wish we could have been in Boston, but we were on vacation, so...  Yeah, you did okay.  We had a great time at the brewery. 
[02:04:30]  Cool.  We didn't have Darva this year, but we did have Matt Damon.  That's cool.  So, there were some good people, but we'll bring you guys to Boston, and we'll have some fun.  Hey, audio of Jim with a concussion in the hospital.  Yeah.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Really not making much sense.  Poor Jim.  Poor Jim just laying on the ground.  Oh!  Oh!  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Somebody help me!  Help me!  Help me! 
[02:05:00]  Hey, I got more audio of Jim right here.  Hello.  Yeah, there we go.  Wow!  I need a drink!  Yeah, that makes sense.  This sobriety is not what it's cracked up to be.  Yeah.  And some of Jim's final words before being taken away.  Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  Well, I'm glad you guys are syndicated now, and I can be humiliated across the country. 
[02:05:30]  I'm delighted for that.  Jim Cook, and please, stick to brewing that fine beer of yours.  I will do my best, man.  And keep off the bicycle.  What are you bicycling for?  You're like, you're in shape.  You're not fat or anything.  I know.  Well, I didn't have anything to do.  It was early in the morning.  Drink beer!  You should have had a beer.  You should have had a beer.  From now on, at 6.30 on Sunday mornings, I'm opening a beer.  Through the exercise.  Hey, Jim, help us out. 
[02:06:00]  First day of school back there in Boston at all the colleges?  Yeah.  How hot are the girls walking the streets right now?  Very nice, because the weather's warm, so they're not, like, all dressed up.  Well, we do have Jim talking to one of the young college co-eds right after he put his bicycling  wear on.  So, what do you think of my tight pants?  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  Wow, you were pretty cocky before the crash.  Yeah.  Well, I had a Sam Adams in my pants. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  It was the 12-ounce long neck that I was proud of.  Hey, Jim.  Oh, an ambulance driver we have right here?  What is your major malfunction, nut nuts?  Yeah, they're so friendly here in Boston.  Anthony, this is really wild.  They got a cop giving Jim the business after the accident.  Really?  Because he was backing up traffic and stuff.  Marijuana is an narcotic.  Medically and legally, it never did anybody any good, and does everybody a lot of harm. 
[02:07:00]  The last thing Jim heard before something hit him.  My head hurts.  More audio of Jim with a concussion.  With a concussion, Anthony.  I got sort of a kind of brain.  All right, well.  Only you guys could make a concussion funny. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  This abuse sponsored by Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  There you go.  All right, Jim.  Take care of yourself, all right?  I will.  God love you guys.  I hope you had a good time on vacation.  Hold on, Jim.  I just want to play a little something for you before you go.  All right.  Show our love.  Bicycle.  Bicycle.  Bicycle.  I want to ride my bicycle.  Bicycle.  Bicycle.  Bicycle.  I want to ride my bicycle. 
[02:08:00]  I want to ride my bicycle.  Take it out.  All right.  I'm humiliated.  I'm buying a Harley tomorrow.  No!  Star Wars.  All right.  He's taking enough abuse.  All right, Jim.  Take care, Jim. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  We look forward to your next screw-up.  Oh, yeah.  It won't be long.  There he is.  Brewer of Sam Adams.  Jim Cook.  We like to call him Mr. Magoo.  Oh, my George.  Magoo, you've done it again.  Oh, eh.  Oh, eh.  I seem to have fallen on my bicycle.  Ah, Magoo.  Oh, eh.  Thank you, Jim.  Bye.  He's not even laughing. 
[02:09:00]  We just beat him down.  I know.  We just beat him down.  Gotta love that guy, though, man.  The guy is, I don't know how, multi-quadrillionaire with his Sam Adams.  He cooked it up in a sink years ago, and now it's a beer empire.  And he's still just a regular guy.  He's a regular poor son of a bitch crashing his bicycle.  Al, what's up?  Yes, I wanted to ask Jim who finished delivering his newspapers.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, man.  All right.  That was funny.  Well, when we get back to someone...  Steve from Staten Island saying they ought to make a new beer.  Slam Adams.  With a picture of him on his bicycle.  With his cast.  With his cast.  Here comes Slam!  Slam Adams.  He should work it into his new commercials, I think.  Slam Adams.  Hi, I'm Jim Cook, brewer of Sam Adams.  Ow.  My ass hurts. 
[02:10:00]  Next time, I'm just going to drink beer.  It's like my great-grandfather used to say.  Get off the effing bike, you tool.  Drink a beer.  Kick your shirt off.  I was very injured, and my shoes fell off, and I lost my glasses.  Ouch.  Poor guy.  All right.  We love him.  My head hurts.  I'm not lying.  My head hurts.  He's good. 
[02:10:30]  He takes the abuse well.  He sat it out.  He just sat there.  He just sat there.  He knew he had to take it.  It doesn't matter who you are.  If you're a part of this show, you're going to spend some time in the barrel.  1027 WNEW.  Let's try John on line one.  John, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to mention the Arnold Schwarzenegger mishappen that happened recently.  The radio chick mentioned it before, 10 minutes before they got off the air. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  He groped some news reporter.  He groped a TV reporter.  It was in my paper on Long Island, but I can't find it in the New York edition.  I want to show these guys.  I couldn't find it either.  I just heard it like 10 minutes before they went off the air.  She was saying that he was staring at her cleavage the whole entire time.  Hello, cutie pie.  All right.  Wait, wait, dude.  We need someone to send us the story because I did read it.  I can't find it in the papers that are in the studio because, I mean, there's some hilarious 
[02:11:30]  stuff in this damn thing.  Yeah.  He was saying that she looked fantastic the whole time.  Right, right, right.  And she was too scared to tell him off because, you know.  Well, someone sent us a link.  Now we're having fun.  Someone sent us a link to the story because I can't find it.  All right, John?  Okay.  And then we'll share it with everybody.  No problem.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, I heard about that, but I want to read the story.  All right.  We found the Arnold story.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, NewYorkPost.com, Anthony.  TV reporter claims Arnie groped her. 
[02:12:00]  You got some sound effects to help us along with this story, maybe?  Hello, cutie pie.  Of course.  And then we're going to play the Arnold song.  Yeah, the Arnold song rolls, which is hilarious.  Maybe that movie shouldn't have been called Kindergarten Cop-A-Feel.  What?  Maybe that movie should have been called Kindergarten Cop-A-Feel.  Oh, I get it.  A British TV reporter says superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger made sexually suggestive comments  and groped her after an interview, Anthony.  No problemo.  I was angry, Anna Richardson said.  How are you?  She's angry. 
[02:12:30]  I want to say, you dirty bastard, but you can't tell a powerful man like him to F off.  I'm the party pooper.  The alleged groping took place with Schwarzenegger was in London doing interviews for his new  sci-fi flick, The Sixth Day.  Good morning.  The reporter, who was wearing a miniskirt and knee-high boots for the interview, said  their chat turned awkward pretty quickly.  You're close.  Give them to me.  Now.  He kept saying how fantastic I looked and staring at my boobs. 
[02:13:00]  How are you?  And when the interview ended, the married father of four suddenly turned into the gropinator.  Now we're having fun.  When I went to shake his hand, he pulled me onto his knee saying, I really want to know  if your breasts are real.  Hello, cutie pie.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Dana.  Dana.  Dylan.  Dylan.  She told him that she was an F-coat.  What?  Wow.  She told him that she was an F-coat.  Excuse me.  What? 
[02:13:30]  Does she have huge boobs, then?  Well, that's the British equivalent of a triple D bra size, Anthony.  Ah.  And that's when the robusty Richardson said the star took matters into his own hands and touched  her breasts.  That's great.  He then said, yeah, they are real.  Now we're having fun.  Yes, Arnold.  The stunned stunner said she stood up and told Schwarzenegger, you're making me very nervous.  You son of a bitch.  The 53-year-old told her not to be and pulled her back onto his knee. 
[02:14:00]  Whoa.  I said, this is the reporter speaking, can I go, please?  He said, yeah, and patted my bum as I went off.  I don't believe it.  Oh.  Now we're having fun.  Oh.  How are you?  I don't believe it.  No problemo.  I don't believe it.  Eh, eh, eh.  Hello, cutie pie.  I don't believe it.  Oh.  Nice.  Schwarzenegger's spokesman told the paper the actor was getting a raw deal. 
[02:14:30]  I don't know anything about this particular incident, but Arnie is a big flirt, as is Anna,  he said.  There you go.  Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to see if this lady with an F cup had real boobs or not.  Yes.  Allegedly.  Want to play the Arnold's song?  Yeah.  This came in today.  It's really effing funny.  No problemo.  I hope you're rolling tape.  I don't even know who to give credit to. 
[02:15:00]  Remember the movie Total Recall?  Total Recall.  The movie rocks.  Listen to the very obscure references in this song.  Yeah.  Some obvious references, and then he gets really obscure with his references.  Check this out.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I've been dreaming of going to Mars, where mutants drive plastic cars. 
[02:15:30]  So I go there, you know the rest.  The best part is the girl with three breasts.  Total Recall.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Recalling.  Recalling.  Totally.  Recalling. 
[02:16:00]  Recalling.  So I'm on Mars, and I meet with Paul.  And I pull this big metallic thing out of my nose.  It makes me scream and shout and move my big robotic head all about. 
[02:16:30]  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  See you at the party, Victor.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  One more time, fellas.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  I'm going to stop falling. I'm so sad. I can't screw Sharon Stone and Macaulay Culkin has left home all alone. 
[02:17:00]  Johnny, give me the bass. You've got to slap it a little harder. Give me the bass. 
[02:17:30]  I don't think it's in room because I don't know the figuring. It's not working. Johnny, grab my hand.  Grab your bass. 
[02:18:00]  Ah, 1027 WNAW.  Howdy, Quaid.  People aren't finding it as funny as we did.  No, stop. Are you kidding?  You've got to be out of your mind, Kevin.  Come on. I mean, I know you suck and win today and I'm still listening, man, but now you're really reaching, man.  That was funny.  Come on. You're playing something that's 10 years old, man.  I've never heard that before. That was hilarious. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, man, are you kidding me?  Who cares? Who cares how long ago it came out? It was the first time I heard it and I thought it was funny.  We were laughing our balls off in the back office. We figured we'd share and you didn't like it. All right, well, whatever.  No, man, come on.  All right.  I mean, thank you.  Thank you, Kevin.  I don't know. Maybe we're just not in touch, Opie. I found that hysterical.  We're all singing it around here.  Oh, man. Everyone said it sucked. I thought it was hilarious. Pete, what's up? 
[02:19:00]  Hey, this sounds like the kind of crap that Anthony's brother would put out.  Babe, wait a minute.  You've got to have a boy out of sympathy.  It's got to be a gig.  Right.  Come on.  What are you talking about?  No one liked the song.  It's not that funny.  Tom, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  What is this, Rotgut?  Everyone's a comedian.  Someone had to like it. Come on, Daryl.  Daryl.  Yeah.  You didn't like that song?  Oh, it was bad.  What was bad about it? 
[02:19:30]  It just wasn't funny.  No?  I thought it was funny.  No.  I thought the guy had the voice down and everything.  I thought the voice was okay, but it was bad.  You guys are getting way too picky with our show.  Isn't they crazy?  Usually one person, if people don't like it, one person around the office would have gone,  ah, it's not that guy.  We were laughing.  But we all thought it was hysterical.  Dave, what's going on?  What's up, man?  That song was freaking great.  It's hilarious.  That song was incredible, man.  I'm sorry. 
[02:20:00]  I don't care what any of you dudes say.  That song was freaking awesome.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Peace.  Bye.  Yeah, it's funny.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, guys, come on.  You've got to be kidding me.  You really didn't like that?  The first, I'm telling you, the first, the first chorus was okay.  After that, just like, there's nothing going on there.  It was fun.  I thought the singing thing was hysterical, how badly he was singing.  That was good.  You know, you guys just don't know comedy.  Good stuff.  All right, Frank.  Some good stuff right there. 
[02:20:30]  That's top shelf.  These people just don't know comedy, eh?  Top shelf.  Top notch.  Top notch.  We'll tell you what's funny.  Bastards.  You son of a bitch.  See, Arnold's all mad at you now.  Trust me, we know funny.  That was funny.  Now we're having fun.  That's right.  All right, well.  What happened?  We'll take a break.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  So there's radio, there's edgy, there's psychotic, and then there's ONA.  1027-WNEW. 
[02:21:00]  All right, we're back on our phone line.  Leah.  Hey.  Sorry, Leah, to make your wait there.  What's your last name?  My last name is Reich, R-E-I-C-H.  Leah Reich.  Mm-hmm.  And your website is one of the most popular for guys on the Internet, right?  Yeah, it is.  It's huge.  We are IGN, and we have entertainment, video games, sci-fi, movies, DVD, Babe of the Day.  Did you guys hear about Babe of the Century?  Babe of the Century, no. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, there was a huge voting thing for Babe of the Century.  That was us.  Elizabeth Hurley won.  Elizabeth Hurley?  For Babe of the Century?  Babe of the Century, come on.  Hey, I didn't vote for her.  Yeah, I don't know about that.  I would go for the girl that's on the cover of Gear Magazine this month.  Gear.  Jessica Biel?  The chick from what?  The 17-year-old?  No, the 7-7 broad, right?  He's 17.  So?  So?  She's showing Nippon Magazine.  Who cares?  That's one of the hottest photo spreads I've ever seen in my life.  Really? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  I don't think it was that hot.  I've seen better, but...  Are you a lesbian, Leah?  Well, that's personal information, and I don't really give that out.  No.  That's a yes.  Okay.  I mean, come on.  I write about guys.  I've got to know a little bit about them.  Well, then you're bisexual.  That's okay, right?  Hey.  All right.  So you get a ton of hits.  A lot of guys go there for advice.  Yep.  And I'm sure you get a lot of weird questions.  I get the best questions on earth.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I get letters that start out with no hello, no nothing, just my penis itches all the time. 
[02:22:30]  That was me.  I got a letter from a guy who's had this terrible crotch itch problem for three years, and he's  writing a letter to me.  He's like, now it's starting to have pus come out of it.  Do you think I should go to the doctor?  Oh, mm-mm.  I'm just like, you know what?  What are you thinking?  Ladies, man.  Does the guy shower?  Yeah.  He says, well, I keep it really clean, but it's just itching, and now it's turning a different  color, and there's pus coming out.  I'm like, three years, and you don't think you should go to the doctor? 
[02:23:00]  Right.  So what did you tell the guy?  To go to the doctor?  Go to the doctor.  Take a shower, maybe?  Get some medication.  It wasn't signed by Spaz, was it?  No.  Oh, okay.  No.  Just had a check.  No.  He probably would have used the pseudonym anyway, don't you think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would have.  Well, there was another guy who wrote, why is my ass hairy?  No.  He wanted to know the best way to get rid of some of his ass hair.  He said, my ass is too hairy.  What can I do about it?  Ass hair.  Yeah, and I wrote, well, you know.  I guess he's not talking about, like, on the cheeks. 
[02:23:30]  You know what?  I didn't really ask him to go into a lot more detail.  Uh-huh.  Visualization is something that I have to do a lot, and I didn't want to know where it  was, but I gave him some options for hair removal.  Being a girl, I'm familiar with most of them.  Yeah.  You know, we have to keep ourselves sleek and smooth.  Uh-huh.  And so I told him a lot of different options, and then I went home, and one of my friends,  living in San Francisco, there's a lot of people who shave themselves here.  Um, and...  San Francisco. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  And...  Just trying to figure out your personal life.  Sorry.  He told me, um, that I should have told the guy to use the Mach 3 razor.  It gets you the closest shave.  Yeah.  But, you know what?  Shaving your butt is really dangerous because the hairs grow in all different directions,  and the only thing worse than a hairy ass is one with red bumps all over it.  Oh.  You don't want any grown hairs.  Do straight guys shave their ass?  Yeah.  I have a friend who's totally straight, and he shaves his chest.  And other parts of his body. 
[02:24:30]  Totally straight, huh?  Yeah, I know he is.  Why bother with the ass, though?  Well, I mean, if you can't tell where the hair on your head begins and the hair on your  legs, begins, don't you think...  I mean, hey, some women find it sexy.  Some men find it sexy, too.  What, hairy asses?  Yeah, hairy bodies.  No, hairy asses we're talking.  Yeah.  There are people who find a lot of body hair sexy, no matter where it is.  Yeah.  Honey, if there are men who find old women, like, and big, giant, pregnant women who 
[02:25:00]  want porn about that, there are going to be people who find hairy asses sexy.  I checked out the pregnant porno sites.  Uh-huh.  And?  Well, I was, um, you want to get into this a little bit?  Well, you know, what do you think?  I was, uh, I had a little fetish going.  Uh-huh.  We've discussed it on the radio show.  You have a pregnant woman fetish?  I thought I did, Leah.  And then we had a girl come in here who was, what, eight months pregnant?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was huge.  And we had her dance for us and stuff, or for myself, and I was completely turned off. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, it didn't last.  No, I got rid of that fetish quickly.  Which part turned you off?  Uh, it was just, it was just beyond bizarre.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, she was ready to drop, too.  We tried to have her, uh, give birth live on our show, but it didn't work.  Oh, that's quality radio talk.  It was quality radio talk.  Award winning, mind you.  Yeah, we win awards all over the country now for stuff like that.  I can only imagine you're really pushing the envelope for women's rights.  We had her running up and down the stairs.  We had her have sex with her husband in another studio. 
[02:26:00]  This was when she was, uh...  Did you get paid for this?  No, she was, actually, when she came in to give birth, she was past her due date.  So we had her doing jumping jacks, uh, running up and down the stairs.  We wanted to induce labor here on the show.  Live on the show.  Then, um, then her husband banged her in another studio.  Did you bang her?  Did you want...  Did you...  Are you horrified yet?  Did you actually want...  Oh, I'm totally not horrified.  How can I be horrified?  I work in an office with guys, and I get letters from kids who ask me how I can make their penises grow bigger. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, what can...  There's nothing in the world, practically, that can horrify me.  How do you answer that one back?  Yeah, I need to know.  I say that this is Ask Lea, not the Psychic Friends Network, honey.  I don't know if your penis is going to grow.  Yeah.  You know, and the thing is, is, like, most of those penis enlargement things...  Mm-hmm.  They're...  I mean, some of them...  I mean, if something really, honestly, truly worked, don't you think we'd all know about it?  Yeah.  If something was really worked and didn't have scary side effects or didn't have all kinds of possible things that could go wrong and weird things that can happen, and if it was really permanent, we'd know about it. 
[02:27:00]  I mean, there are pumps and there are creams and there are this and there are that.  The cream.  Why doesn't the cream make your hands bigger?  Exactly.  Remember that old gag?  I mean, do you really want to attach weights to your penis every day to try and stretch it out?  I do.  I bet you do.  I bet you have them on right now.  Yeah.  I do.  Oh, it's stretching out.  Yeah.  On the top of my knees.  Yeah, I don't understand that one.  On the top of my knees.  Yeah.  Does that work, though? 
[02:27:30]  It's apparently worked for some people, but I think you've got to have a lot of patience and definitely a little pain tolerance.  Yeah.  And you've had a lot of strange letters lately?  Yeah, I've had some good ones lately.  Well, I get them from all different ages.  Mm-hmm.  You know, they all want to know so many possible things, not just about...  I have a column called What's Up With My Penis, which answers more of the medical stuff. 
[02:28:00]  I don't actually answer those regularly, but I get them all.  In your little letter here that we received, what's...  My little letter.  What's that bump on my penis?  Uh-huh.  Can too much masturbation stump my growth?  Yep.  Will she go out with a geek like me?  Oh, yeah.  I get guys of all ages who are convinced.  I get guys who have never gone on dates.  Uh-huh.  And I'm not talking about just 14-year-olds.  I get guys of all ages.  Earl Douglas.  Our own black girl here at the studio. 
[02:28:30]  I get all the questions.  I get guys who are 32 and newly divorced and have no idea how to start dating again.  Yeah.  I get guys who...  I got the best one.  Can I read you the best letter ever?  Of course you can.  I'll read you a couple.  This one, I don't know how old this kid is, but you've got to tell me the best part.  Leah, my girlfriend and I have our two-month anniversary coming up, and she said I could...  You don't have to answer, but I could use some help.  It's like, buddy.  Yeah, that's got to be a kid.  The best thing... 
[02:29:00]  That's a 15-year-old.  I know.  The best thing in the world, though, is the fact that his girlfriend is like, sweetie,  I want to talk to you about something.  There's a special occasion coming up.  Yeah.  And I've got a good surprise for you.  Yeah.  Hey, that's right.  Has a girl ever said that to you?  No, I...  You can suck my boobies.  I loved when she said that.  That would be hysterical.  Suck her boobies.  All right.  Read another one for us.  Um, I don't have any of the older ones, because...  Oh, you guys will like this one.  You can give the advice to this guy.  Okay.  Dear Leah, hi, I am a younger teen, and I have a few questions. 
[02:29:30]  I wanted to ask you if it is normal when I see two women kissing, not like kissing on  the...  Wait, we might have to clean that up for the radio.  His junk gets, uh...  You can't say penis?  I don't know what they dump out of on our show.  That sounds good.  It's very clinical now.  All right.  Yeah.  She's an advice columnist.  We can get away with a lot more than we usually do.  Yeah.  And he said, um...  Very excited.  I wanted to know if it is normal to be aroused a lot.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  But, um...  Yeah, I get...  I get a lot of...  A lot of questions about the penis.  Guys who have different questions, they don't know.  I get...  I got so many questions about average penis size that I had to go ahead and write a whole  article about it.  And what do you think's average?  What do I think the average or what do I...  As far as I know, average penis size is 6.4 inches in length and 5 inches in circumference.  Rock.  5 in circumference?  I like how it suddenly gets really quiet as everyone starts looking at the sound. 
[02:30:30]  Wait, 5 in circumference?  I'm trying to...  Yeah, if your penis is 2.5 inches in...  That's not diameter, Opie.  It's not a tuna can.  I'm like...  It's like a big Foster's oil can.  I know.  I was looking at the Foster's beer can on the other side of the studio.  And I get a lot of good questions from guys who have girlfriends who have never had orgasms  and they don't know how to help their girlfriend have an orgasm or guys who want to last longer.  Yeah.  Um, those are all really good ones because those are pretty easy. 
[02:31:00]  Well, Leah, you want us to put you through the test?  You want to answer a few questions from our lovely audience?  Oh, I can give it a shot.  Is there anybody who wants to ask me a question?  I don't really answer...  I can't give medical advice out.  Right.  So, no penis questions.  But if you've got any relationship or sex questions, we can give it a shot.  Or, I mean, there could be some things you can answer about the penis.  Like what?  I don't know.  We'll go to the phones next and we'll find out, okay?  Okay.  Give out the website.  We've got to take a break and then we'll take some questions from our audience.  It's www.IGN4men.com and you spell out the four. 
[02:31:30]  So, it's I-G-N-F-O-R-M-E-N.com.  All right.  Very good.  More with Leah next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  There's a good example of four programs.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back.  We're talking to Leah.  Hey.  Hey, Leah.  What's going on?  She's got this great website. 
[02:32:00]  A lot of guys go to it and they ask her advice on sex and relationships and stuff, right?  That's right.  Very popular website.  It's IGN4men.com.  I-G-N-F-O-R-M-E-N.com.  And you get a lot of funny, funny questions.  I get a lot of funny ones.  I get a lot of serious ones.  I get them all.  And a lot of people, they write to this stuff and you think they're joking, but they're  not.  Some of them, I wonder.  They're pretty clueless, right?  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Well, we're going to put you to the test.  We've got a bunch of guys on the line that want to ask you some advice, okay?  Okay.  Let's try it.  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Uh-oh.  Your phone's crapping out.  We've got Leah on the phone.  You've got some advice that you need?  Yeah.  I think I found my girlfriend's G-Spot.  And I was wondering if she could recommend any sexual positions that might help us.  Do you utilize it?  Well, that's kind of a trial and error kind of a thing.  I mean, everybody's G-Spot.  Generally, the G-Spot is around in the same area inside. 
[02:33:00]  So you're going to have to experiment because there are some positions that are going to  feel good and some that aren't.  I mean, if I were you, a lot of good G-Spot is manual stimulation.  You can do a lot with that, with your hand, if you can find it with your hand.  That's what works best, is if I use my finger.  You know what?  There are some positions that are going to be good, but some of them are just acrobatic,  uncomfortable.  While you're trying to find the G-Spot, you're, like, throwing out your back, and what's the  point of that?  Right.  I mean, basically, you know what?  If you guys can find your G-Spot, God, you're lucky, because most people can't. 
[02:33:30]  Well, what...  So just do what feels good and don't even worry, you know, to try different things.  It's totally awesome.  I can tell when I hit it.  Yeah.  What sexual position do you suggest there, Leah?  Like the wheelbarrow position?  Have her walk around the room as you're holding her legs or something?  Is that going to feel good?  I don't think that's a good one.  I don't think that's a good one.  Yeah, that's a really relaxing sexual position.  You know what?  There are some that are good, like if, you know, she's lying down and you're standing up,  and kind of tilted up, that might work. 
[02:34:00]  You know what?  Honestly, the best thing is all that Cosmo, these are great sexual position things, it's basically  a matter of kind of experimenting around and figuring out what feels good.  Some women really like when you're in a chair, and you're sitting on, they sit on your lap,  either facing forwards or back.  Right.  That's always a popular one.  That's what you like, right?  This is so not about me.  This is about him and his G-Spot girlfriend.  I just want to know your credentials.  Like, have you seen a lot of, you know... 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, are you like an expert?  Can't give you my references, but...  No.  I know a few things.  Yeah?  Through experience?  Oh, wait.  Hey, I thought we were giving advice here.  Yeah, we are, but I just want to know a little about you.  I've had my experience.  I don't know who's giving the advice.  Just the right amount.  Leah, have you ever seen a penis?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I've definitely seen a penis.  All right, good.  All right, so you suggest those positions for Tim to start with?  The positions would be really good. 
[02:35:00]  But you know what the reality is, is that the angle, it also depends on the angle of  your penis, the angle of the vagina, all those kinds of different things.  Very good.  You could...  If I were you, I would just roll around, get sweaty, and try everything you possibly  want to try.  And see what happens.  Oh, yeah, what the hell?  You can put that trigonometry to good use.  Angle.  There you go.  Try to figure it all out.  Thank you, Tim.  Let's go to Dominic.  Dominic, you're next.  What's going on?  Hello?  You're talking to Leah.  Hi, Dominic.  I got my schween caught in the junk drawer. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  Wait, what?  You got your schween stuck where, Dominic?  In the junk drawer.  How ironic is that?  I was very, very injured.  All right, obviously somebody just having a little fun.  Hmm.  Somebody is a happy hour there, right?  I was walking in the dark kitchen, and it got caught in the drawer, and now it's got  spent.  You get it?  Junk drawer.  You know, his junk got caught in the junk drawer.  How can I fix it? 
[02:36:00]  Leah, you got questions about that?  Guys getting their stuff stuck in places?  No, I sure don't.  Usually things don't get stuck that easily.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  You know, I can't imagine that happening.  God, that would be so...  Can you imagine going to the emergency room in that position?  I'm sure there have been more embarrassing positions.  People have gone to the ER.  Yeah.  Tony, you're next.  Things up their butt.  Hey, Tony.  Yo.  What's up?  You're on with Leah.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, what's going on, Tony?  You guys are rural.  Good.  Hey, I was wondering, how can I put this, get my girlfriend off without having to go south 
[02:36:30]  of the border for more than 15, 20 minutes?  Why?  You don't like that?  Is she really...  I don't like it.  It's just kind of...  Your jaw gets tired.  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah.  No, totally.  Hey, girls have the same problem.  If I were you, basically, one of the good things to do is, I mean, no women can, not every  woman can have a really fast orgasm.  Some can, some can't.  She might want to work on it a little bit on her own and try and figure out what positions 
[02:37:00]  there might be something that would work a little bit better.  You might, there might be a position for her to sit in that might help her, you know,  have an orgasm more quickly.  Another thing to do is start out all around.  You can introduce, you know, you can introduce vibrators if you want.  You can introduce the gardener.  That'd probably be even faster.  The what?  Oh, the gardener.  You guys are rotten.  I bet that'd be a fast one.  Yeah.  You can bring the milkman in. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  There's different, the vagina has different angles also?  I've never heard of that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're all different shapes.  That's why, you know how sometimes you fit better in some people and not in others?  Well, I want to.  It's not necessarily because they're stretched out.  It's also because they're different shapes and sizes.  Different shapes and angles and stuff.  It's like Space Mountain in there.  Pitch black and going all kinds of ways.  I once dated a girl.  Huh?  I hit the back wall, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, it was brutal. 
[02:38:00]  You can totally hit the cervix.  And you know what?  It hurts when the cervix gets, the cervix is sensitive.  Yeah.  When you smack into that, it's like, forget it.  All right.  Game over.  All right.  Game over.  Let's move on to Matt.  Matt's got a very good question for Leah.  Matt.  What's up, O?  All right.  You talking to Leah?  She gives advice to Matt.  I got a problem with my girl.  Yeah.  Every time I'm going for the back door, she's all open to it.  She loves it.  I'm fiddling around.  She's digging it, you know?  Yep.  But once I get my junk all the way, you know, doing its thing, she's got to go to the bathroom. 
[02:38:30]  She says she's got to take a drum.  So what am I supposed to do?  Let her take a drum.  Yeah, but then she goes and sits down and she don't have to go.  Yeah, that's because, I mean, you're basically, you're stimulating all kinds of stuff.  It's, you know, you know when you have to go to the bathroom really badly because there's  something sitting in there?  Yeah, that's my screen.  Basically, the body thinks that it has to be clean.  When something sitting in there is Matt.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, the only way, there might just be the way she is.  She might not be able to. 
[02:39:00]  She might have to try and ignore that feeling.  I think I just got to get her to, like, bite down on the pillow and deal with it.  Yeah, seriously.  Leah, in a matter of time, this show is going to be all over the world.  Can you imagine?  I, how I fear, the state of the universe.  It's like gonorrhea.  All right, who do we have next on the line here?  Renee.  Renee, you got a question for Leah.  Yeah, listen, I'm dating this girl and she's got an odor.  Down there.  Uh-huh.  You know?  And I really don't know how to tell this girl.  I mean, she's good looking. 
[02:39:30]  She's hot.  I don't, you know, I've been with this girl.  Honey, in fact, it does not have anything to do with personal hygiene or body odor.  But it does help you get over it.  But it's not body odor.  No, I know.  No, I'm talking about different bodily odors.  Well, it could be a number of things.  It could be hygiene.  It could be something.  It could be an infection.  I'm not talking necessarily about an STD.  It could be something like a yeast infection.  She doesn't work at the Bumblebee factory, does she, Renee?  Hey.  This is what I don't understand.  See, this is the bad part.  Because I've been with her.  I was with her once.  Uh-huh. 
[02:40:00]  And it was a small odor filled up the whole room.  Okay.  You either, you either, you either.  Look.  Okay.  This is my motto.  If you're close enough to do it, you're close enough to talk about it.  And if you can't say something to her about it, then you probably should find a reason  to not go out with her anymore.  Pop in a Mentos.  Well, that's the whole thing.  I'm still hanging out with her, but I don't want to go down there.  Well, then you have to say something about it, because you're going to have to go down  there eventually.  That's my problem.  How the hell do I say something?  You say, you know what?  I don't know what this is.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever had to do in my life. 
[02:40:30]  I feel super uncomfortable and stupid, but there's, you know, or you could say, hey,  once before I had this girlfriend, and she had this odor, and it was a yeast infection,  and I'm thinking that, you know, that's something that I've noticed.  It's not bad.  And, you know, I wanted to talk to you about it.  I don't know what it could be.  Are you explaining to this guy who's talking to me right now?  I'm talking to him.  Oh, okay.  I'm telling him what he should say.  I don't know.  You'll give me an offer.  Hey, Renee, Renee, I got some advice for you.  It's hope.  I was in a very similar situation. 
[02:41:00]  You've got to dump the bitch, man.  That's my kid, you know?  You've got to.  That way.  And you know what?  You'll solve two problems.  You'll get rid of your bad breath, too.  Oh, Jesus.  Yo, I can't go down.  I haven't went down there like that.  I'm not doing that.  You know what you do?  Subtle hints sometimes work.  A snorkel and a mask.  Stuff like that.  It'll work.  I'm hoping she hears the phone call.  All right.  Well, the question.  You can stick an air fresher down there.  You know, the comments.  Yeah.  You want to, like, peel off back.  A stick-up. 
[02:41:30]  This is a good place for a stick-up.  My name is pretty unique, and I'm hoping she hears this phone call.  I'm talking about her.  Get a can of Lysol.  You better hope she's not listening to the radio right now.  All right.  Thanks, Renee.  Thanks a lot.  The questions are getting better, Leah.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  Let's go to Joe.  Joe's got a very serious question here.  All right.  Joe.  Hello.  You need some advice from Leah, huh?  Joe.  Yeah.  Okay.  You guys can just break my chops all you want.  This is one of the things where being hung like this is actually not a good thing. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  So you got a big one?  Yeah.  My wife is kind of tiny.  She's, you know, she's with the gymnast and dancing.  She's kind of tiny.  I'm a big guy, you know?  Yeah.  And, uh...  Leah, he's hung.  What...  Yeah, we got the...  I think I've caught on to that point.  Yeah.  So what's the advice for Joe?  It...  You know, sex...  Normal sex is kind of cool every now and then.  You know what I'm saying?  And we can't because I hurt her.  And you guys got married?  Yeah.  We got a kid, too.  Wow.  Wow.  How'd you do that?  Kid got dents in his head? 
[02:42:30]  Carefully.  Carefully.  Very carefully.  Um, that's a toughie.  You know, I'm sure you've tried lubricant and all that kind of stuff, right?  Yeah, everything.  WD-40.  Your WD-40 is so bad.  WD-40 inch.  Um...  What?  Hey, Joe.  I can't believe I'm listening to you.  Hey, Joe.  Neither can we.  Yeah.  Joe, I got some advice for you.  What's that?  Yeah, you take over.  Get a shoehorn.  Come on.  Has she talked to the doctor about it at all?  Has she talked to her gynecologist about it? 
[02:43:00]  No, she's went to the doctor a couple times about it.  And, um, it's just...  It's me.  Yeah, well, I don't know if there's anything you can do.  I mean, she just might be...  You could...  I mean, she's had a kid.  The kid can fit through it.  You can fit through it.  But it might just not feel good.  I hit things.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You hit things.  Yeah, that is the worst feeling.  Um...  Well, we'll have to forget about it.  You might just...  You know what?  I don't know what to tell you on that.  You might just have to be really careful and have, you know, kind of mix things up a little. 
[02:43:30]  You could start out with...  Because, you know, when you get to finishing, when you're having regular sex and you start  going haywire, going all the way in as far as you can, you know, taking it home, the...  Joe, get the jaws of life.  That's the thing.  It's like, that's when you really start hitting things.  That's what I'm saying.  Very good.  But, you know what?  All right.  You try and mix it up a little bit, because I don't know that there's much you can do.  You know, Joe, I think that's a great question.  Thanks for calling today.  Thanks.  You know what I think he's got to do?  Remember when the kid at school used to hold the pencil way down by the tip, and the teacher 
[02:44:00]  would put the rubber band on the pencil and say, don't go below the rubber band?  Yeah.  He's got to put, like, he's got to put, like, a rubber band around his member and just go  that far.  Like a big bumper.  Or maybe, like, those cones they put around the dog's head so they don't chew themselves  when they get back from the vet.  He could put that halfway down, and he won't hurt it.  And he can't go any further.  I'm just trying to help.  All right, Rob, you've got a question for Leah. 
[02:44:30]  She's giving out some advice today to our faithful listeners here.  How do I get my chick to give me a blumpkin?  What the hell is...  Leah, do you know what a blumpkin is?  You know what?  No, I have no idea.  All right, Rob, what's a blumpkin?  Be careful in your explanation.  Be careful and explain what a blumpkin is to Leah.  I got it.  It's when you're taking a...  And the chick's giving you a Hummer. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, okay.  Okay, you're on the commode.  You're on the ball.  That's good.  That's the lady.  That's the lady you got there, Rob.  You're sitting on the can.  And she's giving you a Hummer.  Is she feeding you two at the same time?  Are you drinking a beer at the same time?  Are you resting your beer on her head at the same time?  Yeah, really.  And a crack pipe, bitch.  What did he say? 
[02:45:30]  And a crack pipe, bitch.  I don't know.  Leah.  Angry man.  Leah, I think you pissed off one of our listeners there.  Oh, yeah.  Leah did it.  I'm sure you've never done that.  No, no.  They're all our friends.  Tommy, you got a question for Leah.  Give him some great advice today to the men.  I learned what a blumpkin is.  Tommy.  Hi.  Hi, Tommy.  Hi, Tommy.  Hello, Leah.  Only serious questions at this point.  No doubt.  Hey, no.  Is that something?  What?  I couldn't hear you because the rude boys were interrupting.  What? 
[02:46:00]  What?  She didn't hear you again.  Go ahead.  What?  Is it normal?  Is it normal?  I'm not going to say what's normal or not normal.  Everybody's got their fetishes.  Everybody's got their things.  Oh, come on.  That's out there.  Come on.  Well, you know, hey, you know what?  I live in San Francisco.  Ain't nothing out there as far as I'm concerned.  Leah, the guy's...  What you're going to have to do to find somebody like that is you're going to have to start  going either to clubs, specializing, putting out personal ads.  There are people who get off on that. 
[02:46:30]  There are people who get off on doing it.  I think Stallone likes it.  What?  Stallone likes it.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  I'm sure he does.  So do you suggest Tommy starts off slow maybe or...  I think, yeah, I think what you're going to have to do is you're not going to...  I don't think you're just going to find, you know, Jane Average walking around the street  and say, hey, lady, can you take a call on me?  But I think if you...  You can put personals in.  And there are definitely organizations of people who are completely open to all sorts 
[02:47:00]  of those activities.  And you're just going to have to search those out.  Yeah, you got to start off...  Dude, start off slow with a little hugging, kissing, maybe heart-blowing.  It's not rocket on your cheek.  You know?  It's really sick.  Yeah, we're sick, Tommy.  Remove the plumbing and go down the basement when she goes to the bathroom.  Yeah, remove the end cap on the clean-out pipe.  You guys are sick.  All right, thank you.  Bye, peace.  Jesus, man. 
[02:47:30]  These people.  That's not a bomb.  You ever...  Are you into that at all?  Into...  Defecation?  I can say, I don't care about personal information.  No, that really is not my thing.  So you're from San Francisco?  So your girlfriend doesn't take your f*** on you?  I'm not from here.  I'm not from here.  You live there?  I've been here for a while.  So are you straight or, you know, a lesbian girl?  But didn't we already cover this?  I just want to make sure.  You just want to make sure.  Well, you know what?  If we ever hang out in person, then maybe I'll tell you.  All right.  Dave, what's going on?  Lesbo. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, and you guys rock.  All right.  Only serious questions at this point for Leah.  Yeah, of course, of course.  Okay.  All right, listen, I got a question for the young lady, right?  When my girl and I are doing things, it seems like, you know, she has a problem bouncing  on me.  Bouncing on you?  Bouncing on you.  Yeah.  You know how, like, ride me, so to speak?  Like, if I'm, like, in my horizontal position and stuff like that, it's, she really doesn't  like to get on top.  But I love that, man.  Oh, getting on top.  I can't even like to get on top.  There's a woman out there who doesn't like to get on top. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, what are you kidding me?  This chick will get, like, she'll give me, like, maybe, like, two or three bounces.  And then after that, whew, I'm tired.  Can you get back on top?  Have you ever sat down with her and said, you know what, baby, you know what really turns  me on more than anything is when you get on top.  Have you ever told her that?  What day don't I do that?  Huh?  I said, what day don't I do that?  Do they, like, every night?  Okay, well, I don't know.  I mean, no, seriously, there are guys who will go, why won't my girlfriend do this because  it really turns me on?  And I'll say, have you ever asked her to do it?  And they'll be like, no, it's not like girls are psychic.  That's why I asked you that. 
[02:49:00]  Aaliyah, yeah, Dave, I think I can help you out.  I don't even want to know what you have to say.  I hope he's going to feel this one.  You want her bouncing a lot more when she's on top, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's the best, man.  All right, glue your credit cards to the ceiling.  I mean, that'll get her reaching and bouncing.  Seriously, because even like, you know, we're doing things like that.  I mean, like, you know, she's trying to, like, lay off of it when I'm trying to...  Now, like you told the other guy a little while ago saying, like, oh, how you might be hurting 
[02:49:30]  things and stuff like that?  Yeah.  Now, I don't know if that's the case, but I've asked her several times.  She says no.  She says she's uncomfortable.  Maybe she's not comfortable.  Maybe it doesn't do it for her.  But maybe you can say, look, I'll make you a trade.  You do this, and I'll do something that you want for as long as you want it.  A trade?  Yeah, what the hell?  Yeah, I'm with you at.  A trade?  Yeah.  What sort of trade?  No, say, like, you know, like, I'll, I don't know, you can trade sexual favorites.  Haven't you ever done that?  Oh, man, let's just make a deal here?  Yeah, really?  No, you can be like, you know what, I want to trade, like, one night, you know, I want 
[02:50:00]  to make all these great decisions.  I want to be, I want to have all these things, so will you do this for me, please?  Will you get up on top and stay there for a while?  Yeah.  All right.  Please, for me, because it would make me really happy, and I want to make you happy, so I  want to make you happy in return.  All right.  Well, he's saying she gets tired.  Well, come on, work out and get some more stamina or something.  Okay.  But, Dave, thanks for your question.  We only have a few more minutes here.  We want to get a few more questions on the air.  All right, you guys suck.  Thank you.  A very good question from Dave.  Let's go to Steve. 
[02:50:30]  Only serious questions at this point for Leah.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  How you guys doing?  Now you got a serious question, right?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  It refers to, like, you know, when you're going to take care of the woman, you know, go  downstairs, go south.  Sure.  What is the closest thing you guys can tell me that would be safe as far as, like, what  the smell should be like?  Leah, have you ever been asked that question before? 
[02:51:00]  No, you know, you know, I've never, ever been asked that question before.  Everyone's kind of different.  What is it supposed to smell like?  I mean, it's not supposed to smell...  Like ammonia.  ...super fishy.  Okay.  If you're smelling tuna, there's something wrong.  Oh.  All right.  No, there really is, because there's infections that have a very strong fishy smell.  Okay.  And there are STDs that have a very strong fishy odor.  Yeah, those are the ones I like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I don't, you know, the smell, everybody's kind of different.  I like the smell of a hooker that hasn't showered in two weeks.  I mean, like, you know, sometimes it's clean, sometimes it's kind of like... 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, Leah, he's asking what should it smell like.  Off the top of your head.  Off the top of my head.  I don't...  That's the thing.  The thing is, it doesn't smell like anything else.  Yeah.  It should smell kind of clean, but the thing is, the thing is, the other problem is, is  that at different times...  Oh, stop.  Yeah.  No, gross you out.  No, no, I'm getting hot.  Yeah, I'm going to get it pregnantly.  I like it.  Leah, let me ask, you know...  I like looking at like...  During different times of the month, it smells different. 
[02:52:00]  During different parts of her cycle, it feels different, and it smells different, and  it looks different during different parts of her cycle.  Now, now, should it also be sometimes thick or thin?  All right.  No, seriously, it changes throughout the month.  During different parts of the month, depending on whether she's, you know, ovulating, whether  she's...  What part of her cycle she's in, sometimes it'll be thicker, sometimes...  It shouldn't be chunky.  What if it starts looking like the grill of an Edsel?  It should not look like cheese.  It should not look like cheese.  That's a good rule of thumb. 
[02:52:30]  It's like cottage cheese.  Oh, my God.  That's disgusting.  All right.  Cottage cheese.  Do you like how I can sell gross guys out?  It's the best thing in the world.  Yeah.  I bet we could gross you out a lot easier.  Well, we got to...  No way.  We got to thank Steve for the question.  Thanks, Steve.  Uh, Leah, uh...  Yes?  Taking advice from our listeners, only serious questions, of course.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, you're next on the radio show.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Sorry, I had something in my throat.  What's up, Jeff?  I was wondering if you could, uh, catch Steve Dean's from receiving the rusty trombone. 
[02:53:00]  Ah, you know what the rusty trombone is?  Um, no.  Why don't you guys tell me?  That's a good one.  Well, that's when a girl is, uh, taking care of your back door and doing the reach around  and it looks like she's playing a trombone.  And she's also rim slash hand.  Okay.  Whoa, visualization.  It's the trombone.  Yeah, I got you.  You know, I...  Not being a doctor.  Yeah.  I can't guarantee that you wouldn't, but I can't imagine you would unless you both had 
[02:53:30]  some, unless you had a cut.  Yeah.  On the back door, you know, some, some, you need to have really small cuts.  Oh, cut.  On the back door, like a small cut.  Oh, okay.  That's what I said.  All right.  Going on, if you had a, uh, any kind of problem, you know, back, if you had any sort of infection,  I mean, you might be able to because, you know, something like herpes, while it's hard  to, depending on which one it is, you might be able to transfer it. 
[02:54:00]  I mean, there's a possibility.  Yeah.  Depending on what she's got and what you've got in me, she'll always get tested.  But there are things you can't get tested for.  And if she's got an open sore on her mouth, um, I would not.  She should not be back there.  No.  No.  All right.  That's a very good question from Jeff.  Uh, let's go to George real fast.  George, you got a question for Leah?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Hi, George.  Um, Leah, how you doing, Leah?  Fine, thanks.  Good.  Uh, I have a, I have a weird fetish, I think. 
[02:54:30]  Mm-hmm.  Um, I like to, uh, be thrown up on.  Like, I like to eat it and everything.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, I was just, I was just wondering, uh, how I could convince my girlfriend to do that.  It's gonna make you puke.  How you could convince your girlfriend to do that?  Does she know you have this fetish?  Well, um, I'm a little afraid to tell her because, I mean.  Yeah, that.  I don't know if it's normal or not.  How?  It's, well.  Um. 
[02:55:00]  My last girlfriend used to do it to me, but.  How does your girlfriend, I mean, how is your girlfriend as far as other fetishes and kinky stuff go?  Uh.  I mean, is she totally vanilla?  Is she totally, like, missionary position, honey, turn the light off, put your nightgown back on?  What, the new girl?  The new girl.  She likes it when I suck her toes.  Okay, well, see, that's not really that.  Yeah.  But have you ever talked to her about any kind of, can you toss, you know what you're gonna have to do is you're gonna have to feel around the subject.  Okay.  Um, you're gonna have to say, you know, talk to her about different kinds of fetishes and different kinds of stuff and find out what she's interested in. 
[02:55:30]  Right.  And slowly introduce the subject.  I don't think, like, the next time you take her out to dinner, you can be like, hey, honey, pass the salt and will you puke on me when we're done.  George, does she have a gag reflex?  Um.  Oh, you know, you're so good.  Don't go there.  What?  I'm just asking.  Yeah, if she's got a gag reflex.  Where are you going?  Uh, when you're getting a Hummer?  Yeah.  Just drive that baby home.  Oh, God.  And you'll get her puking.  Yeah.  Or, you know what, you're gonna have to talk about it. 
[02:56:00]  You're gonna have, but you have to introduce it slowly.  And if she's, like, super against any kind of kink or fetish, chances are she's not gonna be up for puke on it.  George, think about the gag reflex or go out and date a bulimic.  A bulimic.  Yeah.  They like throwing up all the time.  Hey, guys.  Take her out to a nice dinner.  Yeah.  And then, uh, punch her hard in the stomach.  Oh.  Thank you, George.  Hey, long time listener, first time caller.  Appreciate it.  Indication.  All right.  Absolutely.  Punch her very hard in the uterus. 
[02:56:30]  Leah?  Get her to puke.  Yes, darling.  We have Mike Tyson checking in.  I apologize.  Hi, Leah.  I have a question.  Uh-huh.  I used to have this problem with Robin Gibbons.  When I was married to her, the bitch couldn't take a punch.  Where is the best place to punch a bitch where I could have sex with her, yet she would not file charges of rape against me?  Am I listening to this?  Am I so not involved in this? 
[02:57:00]  I don't know.  In the goddamn uterus?  Is that where you punch?  Or in the...  Because she had a glass drawer.  I punch her and she go out like a light.  That is the worst thing I've ever heard, ever.  Yeah?  Why is it that you can say goddamn, but you can't say the F word?  Why is it that you can have a woman talk about getting...  Totally getting off, and you can't say the F word?  Hey, goddamn f*** yourself.  There, I said it.  And open dumb dynamics.  There, I just said the F word.  Oh, God. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Let's go back to our calls.  There's a few...  Yeah, why don't we do that?  There's a few good ones left here.  Yeah, you keep talking like that.  And Mike Tyson, come over there and take care of you, Leah.  Why don't we play once in Leah's pants?  You ever play that game?  You take the phone and rub it on your genitalia.  And we have to guess if it's a Mohawk, a diamond, a triangle...  Or completely shamed.  Or completely shamed.  I'm just so not over there.  Something's telling me you're a rainforest.  Mike Tyson's feeling like his Abraham Lincoln's head in a leg lock. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, man.  I apologize.  I apologize for what Mike Tyson is.  Mike just kind of checks in from time to time.  Screw you two homos.  I'll punch yous out, too.  See, we can't even control them.  Mike, you're next.  You got a serious question for Leah.  She's getting a little annoyed at this point.  Yeah, go ahead, Mike.  Yeah, I got a question.  Okay.  Go for it.  Leah, this is a good one.  I need a good answer.  Well, I only get the answer.  My girlfriend gets on top of me, right?  She's, you know, riding me. 
[02:58:30]  Uh-huh.  And all of a sudden, she gets that sound, that fart sound.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It feels so good, but it sounds so bad.  There is nothing.  You can do nothing.  I mean, I tried pulling the buttocks apart to let air out.  It don't work.  Honey, it's not coming from there.  It's not coming from there.  Where's it coming from?  It's coming from there's air trapped inside the vagina.  When you're in there, like, you're causing friction, there's movement, there's air going in and out. 
[02:59:00]  Sometimes air gets trapped, and that's what it is.  It's not coming.  I mean, sometimes you can feel it, and you might be able to tell it's going to happen.  She might know.  You might be able to keep it from happening and slow it down, but you can't.  I and Mike has a solution.  I don't want to hear what he's going to say.  A couple of body blows to the lower abdomen, and then flip her over with some kidney punches.  That ought to drain all the air out.  And if she's still doing it, beat her up on the head. 
[02:59:30]  That way, she might still do it, but at least she won't be giggling when it happens.  Women everywhere applaud you.  Oh, my God.  I apologize.  I can't see it.  Iron Mike Tyson.  Sorry, it's not Opie and Anthony, it's Iron Mike.  Let's go to another Mike on the line.  Only serious questions for Leah at this point.  Mike, what do you got?  Opie and Anthony, a lot of your listeners sound like they're whacked out of their heads.  I know.  We apologize.  But anyway, my cousin works at the city morgue, and I like to sneak in there on Fridays and 
[03:00:00]  fool around with the recently deceased people.  Is that normal?  No, that's not normal.  I mean, that's called necrophilia.  Should I still wear a condom?  Oh, yeah.  I would think that you probably would want to.  I can't receive it, obviously.  Did you guys have all your friends?  No, we don't have friends, Leah.  Believe me.  These are our listeners.  We love them. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, if I were you, first of all, I don't know if what you're doing is legal.  I mean, they're not complaining.  I don't think, well, I can't imagine that they're not complaining.  That's the most action they're probably going to get for a long time.  I think that, you know what, I don't know what you can, honestly, you don't know what  you can catch from dead people, I'm sure, all kinds of things.  Yeah, it's probably, you know.  But I really, that's not something I actually am an expert in.  Well, Mike, thanks for the call.  We appreciate it.  Oh, thank you.  But we got to move on here.  But let's take a couple more.  Josh. 
[03:01:00]  Yo.  Let's get it back on the road here.  You got a question for Leah.  Yeah, I do.  My girlfriend likes me to tie a rope around her neck and pull it real tight when I'm having  sex with her.  Amen, Josh.  Now, if you only couple that with some punches to the face, head, chest, and back region,  you'll be doing it like I and Mike.  Hello?  Leah?  I think we lost that call. 
[03:01:30]  I'm sorry.  I can't imagine why.  Okay.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you got a question for Leah?  Yeah, I got this problem.  Mm-hmm.  My girlfriend tells me that my member smells.  Uh-huh.  And even after I get out of the shower, it smells.  Like, I don't understand.  Like, she did a teabag on me and she just almost threw up in my face.  Yeah?  So...  Are you circumcised?  Yeah.  Okay.  No, I'm serious because, you know, sometimes... 
[03:02:00]  I don't know what it could be.  You're going to have to go to the doctor.  Well, is there any lotion?  Is there any, like, lotion or something that tastes good that I could put on there?  Ew, lotion has the worst taste.  Have you ever gotten lotion in your mouth?  It's like getting open.  You know what works?  Type a lotion, Vaseline.  Apply it very quickly with your right hand.  It won't help the smell, but then you won't care.  That's true.  Any advice for Steve there, Leah?  I'm saying you're probably going to have to go talk to the doctor about it. 
[03:02:30]  I don't know.  You know, it could not be anything.  It could be the soap that you're using.  It could be having a reaction to it.  It could be that, you know, you've got an infection.  It could be you're not cleaning properly.  It could be...  It could be you just had sex with a dirty horn.  And she stunk up your member.  That's like wrapping.  Talk to the doctor.  That's what they're there for.  Okay.  Let's move on to John.  John, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Leah, I have a question for you.  My wife gets very irritated inside whenever I'm banging her sister. 
[03:03:00]  What can I do about that?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  You've got to be kidding me.  The ironic thing, though, is she doesn't get irritated when I prank her brother.  What could be the difference?  Leah, I believe that was a prank call.  Yeah, we apologize.  We apologize.  So let's...  Talk to all the others.  No, all the others were definitely right on.  Yeah, those are right.  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I have a problem with my dog.  When I have sex with him, he won't come when I call him. 
[03:03:30]  Is there a way?  Should I romance him a little bit?  Yeah, you should make the kibble in with the wet food.  That really turns him on.  Because I used to be into necrophiliac bestiality.  Oh, yeah.  I can only imagine.  They're dead animals.  Oh, God.  But I got moved on.  I thought it was more...  Anyway.  All right.  Well, thank you, Glenn.  Jeez, it's so hard to weed through these calls and get the real one.  Dave?  How you doing, guys?  It's a shame that we don't know what these people want to talk about. 
[03:04:00]  I have to ask her a question.  Sorry about that.  Yes, Dave.  I've heard that if you're having, well, I guess, taking a girl from the back door and  you knock her unconscious, I heard she tightens up.  Is that true?  That is absolutely true.  I will answer that.  Does Mike know all about that?  She tightens up real good.  You've got to combine it with some lefts and rights to the ears.  I feel like I'm running the gauntlet.  Like, if I stick it out to the end, something good is going to happen.  But I have to really...  Yeah, I and Michael, come over there and give you a few punches to the universe.  But seriously, does that help?  Does that really... 
[03:04:30]  Because I'll do it with my girlfriend.  I'll just knock her right the hell out.  I hope she turns around and kicks you so hard she ruptures one of your nuts.  Hey, look, it's all about feeling good.  And then, you know, I mean, once she's out, I can play cards on her.  All right, Dave, thank you.  Yeah, thanks.  That was a really quality question.  Dave sounds like a true gentleman.  Yes.  Leah.  What?  Whenever I take a girl to my hotel room and rip her clothes off and have sex with her against  her will, she always fires a rape suit. 
[03:05:00]  How do I stop the bitches from doing this short of killing the bitches?  I suggest that you remove the offending member.  Give you a lot less problems.  Okay.  With that, let's wrap this up with Joe.  Joe?  Joe, what's going on?  You got a question for Leah?  Yeah.  Opie and Andy, I'm really glad I got through.  I've been seeing this girl for like two weeks.  You know, we tried to be intimate like three times.  And every time, like we try to have intercourse, her penis keeps getting in the way.  I don't know what, you know, I haven't been with a lot of girls, or any like girls, but 
[03:05:30]  what do you guys do when your girl's penis is getting in the way?  Leah, do you have an answer to that?  No, but I'm sure you do.  No, I don't.  I know that you're a little bit more of an expert on this.  No, no, I don't have a question.  You're in San Francisco.  I think you could answer this question.  Yeah, well, I think there's a few of that.  I think there's a little bit of that going on in New York.  Yeah.  You know, I keep saying to her, Dominic, what do I do with this? 
[03:06:00]  I don't know what to do.  You've got to help me out.  Okay, Joe.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, Leah, this was a lot of fun.  Oh, yeah.  Do you suggest our listeners pound the website with more questions for you?  Absolutely.  I pound uterus.  There we go.  Couple of five blows.  That's my eye and my having sex.  So, Leah, you definitely want our listeners to, you know, check out the website and pound  the website with more questions for you. 
[03:06:30]  Yes, I do.  You're sure, right?  Sure.  Okay, good.  And that website again?  www.IGN4men.com.  That's F-O-R-M-E-N.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Leah.  Thanks, guys.  This was a lot of fun today.  Great, thanks.  I hope you had fun.  Oh, I did.  All right, cool.  Bye-bye.  There she goes, Leah, everyone.  She's completely disgusted.  You guys did a great job.  Yeah, bravo.  You finally caught on.  The audience comes through.  Only the serious questions. 
[03:07:00]  What a bunch of clowns.  I have a friend that works at the morgue.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. </pre>
