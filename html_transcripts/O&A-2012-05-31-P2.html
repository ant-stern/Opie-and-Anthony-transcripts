<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a main segment featuring boxer Mickey Ward as a guest (though details of this segment are not provided except for its aftermath).  This was followed by the "After ONA Live" segment, hosted by Sam Roberts, which kicked off with a giveaway of a signed Mickey Ward book.  Callers were asked what they learned during the main show.

Responses varied wildly. Larry recalled – or perhaps re-learned – Opie's inability to distinguish between Black people, a claim supported by a played audio clip. He also commented on the hosts' perceived "delusions of grandeur." Sean reported learning the hosts' disinterest in the opinions of a fat contributor from Iraq. Other callers offered insights into the hosts' personal lives, including Sam Roberts' upcoming wedding and Anthony Cumia's potential absence from future shows.  Physical attributes were also discussed, such as E-Roc's stomach capacity and Jim Norton's bizarre pregnancy-themed dreams.

Later in the "After ONA Live" segment, Sam Roberts introduced three new interns, collectively nicknamed "The Sex Brigade."  The conversation shifted to the interns' college experiences, career ambitions, and even their high school games, specifically "Where's Your Junk" and "Credit Card Swipe,"  which were described in some detail.  Roberts, along with others, assessed the interns' attractiveness, personalities, work ethics, and potential. The segment concluded with further playful banter about Sam Roberts' wedding and anticipation for the next show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Alright, alright, alright.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number.  866-969-1969.  Call up.  Tell me, what did you learn? 
[00:00:30]  You're going to want to do it today.  Because there's a prize.  And I know how you vultures love a free item.  Mickey Ward was in yesterday.  You remember Mickey Ward.  He was the fighter, the boxer, who inspired the film The Fighter.  The guy from Boston.  Irish Mickey Ward.  He was in here yesterday, right?  And guess what?  He wrote a book.  A Warrior's Heart.  The True Story of Life Before and Beyond the Fighter. 
[00:01:00]  We got him to sign a couple of books.  And Roland came to me and he said, Sam, I've got a signed book here.  Do you want it?  And I said, you know what, Roland?  Why don't we give that to the listeners?  Why don't we give the book away to the listeners?  That's my heart pouring out for you.  866-WOW1-WOW.  But I'm not just going to give it to you.  You have to tell me what you learned on the show.  Ooh.  Eric, what did you learn on the show?  Like, I'll tell you, Eric, I learned today that you're significantly more comfortable around 
[00:01:30]  me and the show that I put on than you are around Opie and Anthony and the show that  they put on.  Yes, that has been established.  Yes.  I learned Eric, like, comes these off his fingers.  That's another thing we learned today.  Eric, what did you learn?  I learned Troy would eat his flavored candies.  All right.  Hit the, you got the sweet, popcorn, whatever, man.  Whatever.  Here comes. 
[00:02:00]  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  Okie dokie.  Let's start with Larry.  Larry, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  Well, Hollywood primetime, thank you, sweetheart, Roberts.  This is what I re-learned on the show today, is that all blacks look alike to Opie.  That's true.  He can't tell.  I'm sorry?  No, go ahead.  No, he can't tell one block from another, ice cube, ice tea, who cares? 
[00:02:30]  They're all the same.  Eric, do we have that clip?  Yes, one second.  Oh, and Sam.  Yeah.  I also learned that those ham and eggers that open for you every day have delusions of grandeur.  I was thinking that's, ah, it's your channel.  You headline on this channel.  It was said earlier in the week, and something I learned from previous shows, there's no show  without Sam Roberts.  You're dragging these ham and eggers to the finish line at 10 o'clock, Monday through Friday,  everything you can do, you get to keep them on mic. 
[00:03:00]  And then they all try to bask in your glow by thinking they're showing up on the after  show to give you a favor, when they're just basking in your glow.  And Sam, seriously, congratulations on your impending nuptials.  Words cannot express how happy I am for you, and I really hope your marriage to your intended  is richly blessed, and you have a long and happy life together, Sammy.  Thank you, Larry.  Thank you.  Let's play the clip that Larry was referring to.  He's very well-spoken.  Yeah, well, he likes me a lot. 
[00:03:30]  Let's play the clip that Larry was referring to.  Ice tea is outside.  He wants to stop in, but do we have time?  We'll bring him in for a minute.  Ice cube.  Ice tea.  I mean, ice tea.  Holy shit.  I'll tell you later.  So good.  Larry, you just won yourself a book.  Oh, my goodness.  That's right.  I have no, Sam.  I call up because I love you.  I know you do.  Real quick, what do you think of, do you listen to, there's a wrestling show here, Busted Open?  No, I don't listen to that show. 
[00:04:00]  You're not on it.  You got no hoes over that show.  It was total bullshit.  That's your show, Jimmy Wheelhouse.  I refuse to listen to it because you're not on it.  On XM 208, three times a week, it should be your show.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold, Larry.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sammy.  I love you.  All right, Larry just won a book, mainly because he calls up here every day and says nice things.  But it was a good what did you learn, too.  Let's see.  Kenny, what did you learn? 
[00:04:30]  Kenny, you lost your chance.  Sean, what did you learn?  I learned that the boys don't care about what Iraq has to say because he's fat.  That may be the reason.  I don't know.  That's definitely the reason.  I'll go with that.  Roland wants to give you a book, but I'm not going to.  Charlie, what did you learn?  Oh, yeah.  I learned that Troy Kwan loves to teach to come.  Yeah, we already went over that.  What did you learn on the show?  I don't see your name.  I was there.  What's that, buddy?  I learned that Anthony Gumi will not be attending your wedding. 
[00:05:00]  That remains to be seen.  I believe Anthony will be there.  Iraq, do you believe Anthony will be there?  Well, the man said, you know, if it's really nice out there, chances are he's not going to be there.  Do you?  It's going to be Sammy.  Knowing, hopefully, knowing Anthony, do you think he will be at the wedding?  I don't think he's going to attend.  You do not.  Or if he does, he's gone as soon as the bride.  Whether he's leaving early or not is not the question.  I think that is confirmed.  Then, no, I don't think he's coming. 
[00:05:30]  Opie thinks he's not coming.  I think he is coming.  I think he's coming.  You think he is coming, Roland?  Yes.  Iraq, you think he's not coming?  Look, that last thing he said, if the weather's going to be nice, he's really not going to come.  He's going to have a party.  And I just looked at the forecast for the weekend.  It's supposed to be really nice.  So you think he's not coming?  I don't think he's coming.  Okay.  Steve in Atlanta.  Yeah, I learned that the average stomach can hold 32 ounces of liquid, but E-Roc can hold 64.  You get it, E-Roc? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, but that's not what the article said.  No, it isn't at all.  What about a non-autograph book?  He already hung up.  Grammy?  You.  Is that your name, Grammy?  Nah, Graham, like the cracker.  They spell, I don't know, these new interns.  These new interns, we'll meet the Sex Brigade today, I think.  But the Sex Brigade, one of them was on the computer and spelled Graham, G-R-A-E-M-E.  And it's the one that you like.  Well, I can't hear it or spell, I guess.  No, no.  What did you learn? 
[00:06:30]  I learned that Ed Grimley is actually Martin Short and that his wife passed away two years ago.  I was very sad.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.  Kathy Lee also learned that.  She learned that yesterday, though.  Jay, what did you learn?  Morning, Sam.  I learned two things today.  I learned, first of all, that Jimmy may or may not be pregnant.  Yeah.  And also that Anthony might subliminally want to suck Jimmy's dick.  You know what, Jay?  You know how much I love What Did You Learns from the beginning of the show. 
[00:07:00]  It proves you've been listening all day.  You just won a book.  You just won a Mickey Ward book that he signed for you.  Oh, that's great.  Thank you, Sam.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold, buddy.  Yeah, Jim, he came in today.  He slept, which is not something that happens every day.  It's not something that we can count on every day.  But he came in with some odd dreams.  He said that he dreamt that first that he was pregnant for a minute, and then he had gotten a girl pregnant, and he felt bad because he wanted to keep the kid. 
[00:07:30]  But he didn't feel for the girl.  He didn't care about the girl, so he felt bad for the kid.  I think there is, like when you see Jim around little animals, he loves to cuddle them and everything.  There is some part of Jim who I believe wants to be just a mild-mannered suburban father.  I think it's time to bring one of those animal wranglers back in here.  Or maybe he just wants to play with a little tiger kitten.  I don't know. 
[00:08:00]  Maybe that's it.  We should bring one of those animals.  Can we bring him in this building, though?  Yeah, I just got to get permits on that, correct?  You work on that, okay?  Yeah.  Okay.  Skip, what did you learn?  Opie's kid has good intuition about creepy people already.  That's right, Skip.  That's a good call.  Opie said he's already got a list of people who he's going to keep his child away from.  His kid's like two years old.  E-Rock, you've said in the past that you're trying to have a kid?  Yeah, we are.  Are you going to try to impregnate your wife on my wedding day? 
[00:08:30]  The thought has crossed our mind.  Oh, that would be so special to me.  And you'd name it what, Sam?  No, not...  Would you name it Rob Zombie?  No.  Why?  Why would I name it Rob Zombie?  Because I like Rob Zombie.  That's you.  Name your kid Rob Zombie.  But it's at my wedding.  So?  So you'd do something for me.  No.  No?  You have nothing to do with that process.  What about this?  Jack White Nagel.  Ooh, that's a strong name.  That is strong, right, Roland? 
[00:09:00]  That's strong.  Not a fan.  How about this?  What about Hulk Hogan?  Would you name your kid Hulk Hogan Nagel?  No.  How about this?  How about you name it after your two favorite people in the whole world?  The Rock?  Roland Troy Nagel.  What do you think?  Roland Troy Nagel.  I'd abort it.  You would?  You would?  You'd have your wife name it Roland Troy and then abort it?  Yep.  That's awful.  I mean, before he dies, he goes, I love cum.  Have you ever...  That's the Troy part. 
[00:09:30]  Have you ever thought about who you would keep your potential kid away from?  Like, are there any people in your mind right now who you'd be like, you know what, I'd  watch that person?  Not that I know of.  Maybe that's an intuition that picks up...  You know what, it's not something I've actually really thought about because I don't have  a kid yet.  Right.  I think that's something you develop after you have the child.  Well, Opie said, his whole...  Opie has said, his whole perspective on everything changed when he had a kid.  He said the doorman.  Was it the delivery man or the doorman? 
[00:10:00]  I think one of the doormen who comes up with the food delivery...  Creeps his kid out.  Right.  Yeah.  That's like when your dog growls at somebody randomly.  You're like, you know what?  Dude, it's bad news.  Yeah, you don't notice that stuff until you...  Or if you have a dog.  But when you have a kid, that's when you kind of pick up on that stuff.  Right.  I didn't even think about that now.  Because the kids know how to...  Know to trust their instincts.  Whereas we adults, we use our dumb brains for things.  What about you?  Are you going to...  Well, I wouldn't let them come near you.  No, no, no, no.  Are you going to plan for having a kid on your wedding night? 
[00:10:30]  No.  Hell no.  No?  Fuck no.  What?  It's your first night not wearing a condom.  I am not going to have children anytime soon.  Yeah, ruin the fun.  Yeah.  No, it's not a matter of ruining a fun.  It's a matter of ruining their lives.  Have you seen my pay stubs around here?  No.  This is...  I'm not exactly living in the lab of luxury.  You both are going to be crying because you're both hungry.  Yeah, exactly.  The kid is going to be like crying because he's hungry.  And I'm going to be like, I'm with you, dude.  You both have shit pants.  You can't afford to soak that one. 
[00:11:00]  Fist bump on this one, little guy.  We're together on that one.  We're both starving.  What's this?  Lady Trucker.  You're on After All Being Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  I just wanted to take this last opportunity to talk to you as a single man.  Is it something...  I have a feeling that this is breaking a lot of ladies' hearts.  This is probably a tough week.  The fact that the wedding has come up on the air a few times, it's probably been a tough  week for a lot of women, especially who listen to the show.  Has it been tough for you to hear that I'm going to be off the market? 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  I mean, it's really breaking my heart, but you're going to just make a wonderful house  husband for Jess.  Thanks a lot, Lady Trucker.  I don't think she's being sincere.  Yeah, me neither.  I hung up on her.  You know why?  A house husband.  You know why?  If I married Lady Trucker, I might be a house husband because she's the size of a house.  That's the only house husband that I would ever be.  You should abort yourself.  Imagine the shit.  Stop aborting people in there, Eric.  Imagine the shit she takes.  Massive, right?  Right in the truck?  She just shits in her truck. 
[00:12:00]  Well, I'm riding by myself.  Who cares?  I'm making good time.  I can't pull over.  How come you're more comfortable on this show than you are on Opie and Anthony?  Because you don't yell.  Because I don't like...  I let you talk?  They let you talk, don't they?  No, but...  Well, it doesn't matter what I say.  They're just thinking of...  It's a fat joke.  You're an asshole.  Or waiting for me to slip up on something so that they can just pound it into the ground,  and then they move on, not really wanting to hear what I had to say in the first place.  Whereas for me, it's like 50-50.  It could be a fat joke, or it could be I'm listening to the point you're making. 
[00:12:30]  Or you're looking to fill a lot of time.  No, Eric.  We don't fill time on this show.  We provide content to the listeners.  I don't play that game.  Okay.  You know, this is not the self-deprecating show that some other shows are.  We don't fill time here.  Have I mentioned how little time we fill?  When we're doing this show, it's not a matter of filling time.  I don't fill time on this show.  Do you know what I mean, Eric, about filling time?  You don't fill time?  I don't fill time is what I'm saying. 
[00:13:00]  Sometimes I get the impression that you're looking to fill time.  I'm not filling time, Eric.  We have content that we're providing the listeners with,  and the last thing that I want to do is just simply fill time.  Fill time, yes.  Exactly right.  Roland, what do you think?  Do you think Sam fills time?  I think the devils suck.  Maybe they do.  Oh, that's another thing.  Did we do that on the air, or was that during the break,  about Roland's photo dressed up with the L.A. Kings? 
[00:13:30]  Eric sent me this photo.  That sounds like a little fella.  Maybe I'll tweet it.  Is that all right if I tweet it?  Oh, wow.  I'm sorry.  I just got shocked.  Someone in the trash asked if that's okay.  Yes, it's okay.  Not that it's already up on Twitter and Facebook.  Have you tweeted it, Eric?  No, I haven't.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm going to tweet this now, then.  My mom sent me the picture of that same event.  Don't do Instagram because it's an old photo,  and if you do anything on top of it, it may look even worse. 
[00:14:00]  You won't see the detail.  Okay, all right.  Then I'll just tweet it.  Just do a regular one.  My mom sent me the picture of the same event with Wayne Gretzky.  I met him.  Okay, this is a young Rolando's 99.  That's his Twitter name.  I will agree with this photo.  My Twitter name.  I think it was like 11 or 12.  It's amazing.  My Twitter name's not Sam.  That's where the picture's gone right now.  It was a long time.  He's pretty damn tall for an 11-year-old.  It's not only that he's tall.  He's not as tall as the player.  He's standing with a bunch of the L.A. kings.  Kelly Rudy, Todd Alec, the old king.  And he's got a full mustache and a bad Hispanic mullet. 
[00:14:30]  I didn't notice that until you mentioned that he had it.  I saw the mustache, but I didn't notice he has a mullet.  You actually look Mexican in this picture.  I had a mustache like when I was like probably five, six years old.  I was like a hairy little beast.  You should grow the mustache again.  You were a hairy little beast?  I was because everybody was like, oh my God, you have so much hair.  You're like your grandfather.  You're going to be so lucky.  Then I'll decide to go, wait a minute.  He's bald.  I just sent the tweet.  So that's the picture of Roland. 
[00:15:00]  How were you that tall at 11 or 12?  I went through growing pains like a motherfucker.  Really?  Yeah.  Did they make fun of you?  Or were you the popular kid because you could beat everyone up?  No.  They made fun of me and I just made fun of them right back.  You were always this boy.  Yeah.  So when did – because you seem like you were not that much taller now than you were when you were 11 or 12.  Yeah.  I just grew like a quick growth bird and then all of a sudden it just went.  That's hilarious.  Hey, could you send – Eric, could you send Sal out to the lobby to get a couple personal guests of mine? 
[00:15:30]  Sure.  And then send the Sex Brigade in here?  All right.  Right.  You want them right now too?  Yeah.  Give me the three of them.  Okay.  Yeah.  My mom has an old picture of me with Gretzky.  Then there's another picture of me with Jack Nicholson on the set of Batman.  When you were that age?  Like a few years old.  A few years old.  A few years old.  1989, 1991.  Yeah.  Whenever that movie came out.  Yeah.  But you look like you're a full-grown adult, so.  Oh, yeah.  No, there's one that I have a goatee. 
[00:16:00]  When you were how old?  Probably that was like 13, 14.  So when did you start shaving?  My dad touched me.  Tommy had to shave.  You just said my dad touched me.  Oh, no.  Tommy had to shave.  That was a slip of the tongue.  You said Tommy had to shave.  My dad touched me.  I know.  Tommy had to shave like when I was like eight.  Eight.  Yeah.  Literally.  Eight years old.  Yeah.  This guy started getting patches.  That's amazing.  Roland, look who just walked in.  We didn't get a chance to meet him yesterday.  Oh, Uncle Eric's –  Uncle Eric's Sex Brigade.  Uncle Eric's Sex Brigade.  These are the new interns. 
[00:16:30]  Is that the name we're really going with?  Yeah, I think so.  I like that name.  You do?  I like it a lot, actually.  The Sex Brigade.  You don't mind the Sex Brigade.  They're all making themselves comfortable, Eric.  I like it, but I absolutely despise it at the same time.  Why is that?  I don't know.  It just sounds creepy.  Well, what are your names?  I like Creepy.  You like Creepy.  What's your name?  Kevin.  And how come you like Creepy?  I don't know.  It's just funny.  Yeah.  What do you –  You're obviously in college, I would think.  Yeah.  Where do you go to school?  Seton Hall.  Seton Hall.  How about you?  What's your name?  I'm Rob.  Rob, where do you go to school? 
[00:17:00]  Scranton.  University of Scranton.  Scranton.  Mm-hmm.  And how about you?  What's your name?  I'm Connor.  Connor.  I'm from William Patterson University.  William Patterson University.  So what brings –  What are you looking to get out of this internship?  Like what brought you to the Opie and Anthony show, Kevin?  I've been listening to it since I was like in middle school, so –  Oh, by the way, just got a text from Opie.  I hate Confident E-Rock.  So, I mean, at least you know that he's at home yelling at his radio.  Listening to your show. 
[00:17:30]  Of course he is.  Yes.  Everybody is.  Look at these phones.  They're all going crazy for a freaking boxing book.  What were you saying, Kevin?  I don't know.  I've just been like listening to the show since I was in middle school and I –  Middle school?  Yeah, my mom's boyfriend –  And you're how old right now?  I'm a fan.  Like I listened to it when I was on K-Rock and not as much when it was on XM.  Like I did have a subscription for a little while, but I wasn't –  Whenever I drove to school, I always went to break like –  Put on your headphones.  Yeah, man.  Come on.  I don't want to wear my headphones. 
[00:18:00]  So who's the –  Did he just say I don't want to wear my headphones?  I don't want to wear my headphones.  And you made a face like –  You know what?  Guests are the only ones who say, yeah, I don't really want to wear the headphones.  You're trying to make a career in radio and you don't want to wear the headphones.  I never wear my headphones when I DJ.  Why don't you want to wear headphones, Kevin?  I just don't.  I don't like to hear my voice.  Yeah.  That's going to –  So what do you want to do?  Do you want to be a broadcaster?  I did.  Mm-hmm.  But now I'm not like so sure as of a couple months ago.  Why?  What happened?  I don't know.  Like I just feel like – 
[00:18:30]  Not good?  Not great?  There's like 10 jobs for broadcasting in the entire country.  And you're just not good enough to get them?  I got you.  Like what would you say your skill level is at from a 1 to 10, 1 being the worst?  Like a 6.  Like a 6.  Okay.  So that's still failing.  It's better than –  It's better than half, but that's failing.  If I go up like 1, then I'll get a C.  Right.  But you're not there.  You're not quite at C level.  Do you want to talk about Kevin's interview? 
[00:19:00]  Remember when we were screening people for internships?  Oh, when you were interviewing them.  Oh, yeah.  That was the most awkward thing ever.  Why?  Why was that?  I don't know.  Just like my mouth was so dry and I was just like –  That's not why.  Have you been on many job interviews?  No.  You're a young guy.  Yeah.  You suck at them, you said?  I do suck at them.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm just –  I'm just really awkward in this situation.  So job interviews, 1 to 10, 1 being the worst.  Like 2.  Okay.  So, so far, combined, as a broadcaster and as somebody on job interviews, you still have 
[00:19:30]  not achieved a 10.  Right.  Right.  Right.  So you're an 8 out of 20 overall.  Yeah.  Not good.  Yeah.  Not great.  So what do you want to do then?  Like, what do you want to get out of the internship?  I don't know, really.  No.  You don't know.  You're coming in here, sort of blank slate.  Whatever I can get out of it.  Right.  Like, I want – I do want to learn, like, more production-type stuff, because –  You're thinking you're a behind-the-scenes guy.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  And is that because you're not good at broadcasting? 
[00:20:00]  It's not that I'm not good at it.  It's like I don't have the voice for it and stuff like that.  I got you.  Well, a lot of people have said I don't have the voice for it.  I like your voice.  You do?  I do.  Thank you.  Well, he is a huge Sam Roberts fan.  Who isn't at this point, am I right?  That's what I'm trying to get at with.  I would think all three of you are huge Sam Roberts fans, right?  Totally.  If you know it's good for you.  With his interview?  That was – thank you for contributing, Rowan.  Huh?  I used to listen to Special Delivery.  You did?  Yeah.  That's very good.  And then they canceled my account. 
[00:20:30]  Get on the mic.  What do you mean they canceled your account?  I am on the mic.  No, there you go.  Whoa!  Eric!  He's leaning back.  Yeah, but Eric –  I used to listen to Special Delivery.  He's talking back a little bit.  What is this, day two?  You got to get your sex brigade in check.  You worry about that, Eric, ever?  That these guys are going to – there's three of them, and there's one of you.  Yeah.  They're not all going to – what, like, they're going to jump me or something?  Yeah, like Lord of the Flies.  They're going to piggy you.  Oh, that would be horrible.  That's a character in the book.  That's not a fat joke.  I know.  I know.  He got hit in the head with a boulder.  I read it.  So, then is – so, Rob? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Is Kevin – do you think he's the weak link of the crew?  Based on first impressions.  Yeah, I think so.  I could agree with that.  You would.  And are we going to make it three for three, Connor?  Let's go for the perfect.  Okay, three for three.  All right.  So, how does that – do you feel like, okay, I need to step my game up and get to the next level?  I will do better at it as we go along.  I don't know if I can beat these guys up.  You will or you will try to?  I don't know.  He's really good at everything, and he's an overachiever, so I don't – 
[00:21:30]  Who is?  He is.  Well, you're just pointing at people.  You see, this is what I mean.  Right now, I will take your broadcasting level at a six.  We'll definitely put it more.  It's like three level.  Like, this is an audible medium.  No visual elements.  And you pointed and said, he is.  And I said, who is?  Like, giving you a chance to clarify for the audience.  And you did it again.  I met them, like, yesterday.  I don't remember their names off the top of my head.  I met them just now.  I remember he said Connor when he first walked in the room.  All right.  It was great.  Charades on the radio.  You're an overachiever, Connor?  I don't think I am. 
[00:22:00]  Well, how come he thinks you are?  I don't know.  Oh, tension.  How come – so what makes you say he's an – it's not – yeah.  Well, he said you're an overachiever.  How come you think that Connor –  I don't know.  It just comes off that way.  Yeah.  Sal?  Now, Sal, you have kind of been, quote, unquote, what would you say, doing E-Rock's job of showing  the interns what to do.  That's fair, right, E-Rock?  No, that's not fair.  Okay.  Yeah, it's fair.  Doing kind of E-Rock's job of showing the interns what to do. 
[00:22:30]  So far, what are we thinking?  I really – I love not being –  The intern?  The intern anymore and also not being the low man on the pole.  Staff-wise, I am still.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Like, there's a heap of shit on top of you.  Yeah, exactly.  That's me, actually.  The heap of shit.  But, yeah, no, it's nice having them.  It really is.  Now, is Kevin the weak link?  I can't say because I haven't seen any work from them yet.  We've got to go on first impressions.  But I will say, Connor, right? 
[00:23:00]  That's his name?  I love that attitude, by the way.  You knew his name, but you wanted to further say, by the way –  I called him Evan yesterday.  I don't remember their name.  I've been a staff member for the last three days.  A couple days, yeah.  So, yeah, I can forget your guys' names.  No, but the thing is that, you know, we do our drops in Pro Tools and all that sort  of stuff.  We have a – thanks to Connor, we have a full transcription of today's show.  You transcribed the entire show?  We have –  There's a lot of funny shit.  I like that, Connor.  You know what that's called?  Overachieving.  Overachieving.  I like it.  See?  What do you say – this is what's wrong. 
[00:23:30]  That's a good thing.  Why would you not want to be an overachiever?  I don't know.  Just – I don't want to be, like, perceived as, like, a kiss-ass, I guess?  I don't know.  No, you can overachieve and not kiss-ass.  You should be an overachiever.  Especially compared to – what are you getting – like, Kevin is your competition.  If you're just on – like, that's where you're at right now.  You know?  That's – I guess so.  Like, you want to be an overachiever, right?  What's your grades like in school?  3.8.  3.8.  Wow.  Out of four?  Yeah.  I would say that's an overachiever.  It's probably above average. 
[00:24:00]  I would say average would be achieving.  But not perfect.  No, Roland had to point out that it's not perfect.  What are your grades like?  2.6.  Kevin, 2.6.  So you are achieving.  I'll do the bare minimum.  Right.  You're achieving.  You're surviving.  Yeah, you're surviving.  What about you, Rob?  I'm right around a 3.0.  3.0.  Okay.  So you're about –  B, B plus student.  You're B, yeah.  You're not a kiss-ass like some people, Connor, but you're also not bottom of the tone of 
[00:24:30]  Paul, Kevin.  I will say in Kevin's defense, he does go to Seton Hall, and I go to a really easy school.  Is Seton Hall tough to get into?  It's probably harder than a state school, but it's not – I wouldn't necessarily call  it hard.  Yeah.  No, I probably – I don't know for sure, but based on my experience of people who have  gone there, I probably wouldn't call it hard either.  I call the checks clear.  You're like, welcome aboard, son. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Where do you – you said you go to school in Scranton?  Yeah.  In 3.0 or so?  That's good.  Yeah.  I mean, some people call it the Harvard of Eastern Pennsylvania.  Just the people who go to the school, probably.  Just them.  Just you, actually.  Yeah, probably.  What are your majoring in, Rob?  Communications.  Broadcasting.  What about – Kevin, are you a communications major?  Yeah.  How about you?  Yeah.  Okay.  All three communications majors.  And what do you, Rob, want to get out of this? 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  Just learn more about the industry.  Yeah.  Kind of get my foot in the door.  Do you want to work in broadcasting?  Yeah.  Do you want to be a broadcaster?  I think so.  To me, you look like a sportscaster.  Yeah?  That's what you look like.  Either a weatherman or a sportscaster.  You're a handsome guy, Rob.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  I mean, you guys – Kevin, you must have noticed that.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did.  I knew I wasn't the one you were referring to.  No.  Smash, handsome Rob.  When you said that yesterday, we all kind of looked at him like, you son of a bitch.  Right.  Connor asked me if – who it was yesterday. 
[00:26:00]  He's like, oh, who's that L.L. Bean magazine?  But you knew, Rob.  Yeah.  You did.  You did.  You did.  Good.  Well, I mean, they are part of the sex brigade, right?  They are part of the sex brigade.  You have to keep up some, you know, level of attractiveness.  Right.  It's important.  I went home, kind of bragged a little bit.  Yeah.  I was like, yeah.  And I see yesterday you're wearing a t-shirt.  Today you're back to the button-downs and stuff.  So is that – when I say that one of the interns is more attractive than the others,  does it hurt the other two, your two feelings?  Not really. 
[00:26:30]  I have this disgusting playoff beard on my face that I want to get rid of, but the Devils  still need to win four more games.  Is that why it's on your face?  Yes.  I can't shave it.  I'm too superstitious.  I want you to know something.  The Devils don't know you exist.  That's what E-Rox said.  Whether or not you shave has no bearing on their skill as a hockey team.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I still won't do it.  I still won't do it.  Do you look better without the beard?  Slightly.  How do you do with the ladies?  Eh, I don't really try.  Why not?  Like, whatever just falls into my lap.  Whoa. 
[00:27:00]  Which is probably not a lot.  Actually, it's more than you would expect.  How much?  Eh, once every couple months.  Okay.  That's not a lot.  Um, and how do you mean it falls into your lap?  Do the girls just come up to you and be like, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't know.  Chlorophyll.  She literally falls into his lap and passes out.  Right.  Um, how about you, Rob?  You're probably, you're probably a little more than once every couple months, I would  think.  I mean, you know, I got my fair share.  Yeah.  Enough that you don't have to brag about it. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  I mean.  Well, you told me I was partying last night.  You were partying last night.  Oh yeah.  I was partying yesterday.  On a school night.  Afternoon.  What were you doing?  I was just at my friend's house.  Just partying?  Just broing down?  Yeah, exactly.  Just you and your friend?  Nah.  Just partying?  Just a couple chicks.  A couple chicks too?  Mm-hmm.  Was there like, uh, what was going on?  A little pool action.  Swimming pool or billiards?  Swimming pool.  Look at you.  Yeah.  It was a good time.  Well, who knows, right, Sal?  You gotta, yeah.  Maybe they're playing billiards.  They're college kids.  It's a very sexy game of pool.  Yeah.  Strip billiards. 
[00:28:00]  Um, what'd you do yesterday, Kevin?  Oh, I DJed at my, uh, school radio station.  I know it was a tough question.  I was gonna give you a minute.  And then I watched the Devils lose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you had a full day also.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  What do you do?  You DJed at your radio station?  At WSOU.  Is that when you realized, is that where you realized that you're not specifically cut  out for this?  No, I'm actually not bad there.  Like, I know all the music pretty well, and... 
[00:28:30]  You're a music jock.  I guess, yeah.  What do you, do you play music?  Yeah.  All right, so I would say yes.  I would answer in the affirmative.  Oh, like, you, I thought you meant that in, like, a different way.  In what way?  Like, I was, like, really an expert at music.  Okay, no.  I thought that's what you meant.  Jock actually refers to disc jockey, not expert.  Yeah, I wasn't really.  Yeah, that's what it's short for.  Thank you.  Um, no, no, no.  It's okay.  We all get a little nervous from time to time.  Um, Travis, first impressions of the Sex Brigade. 
[00:29:00]  No, Danny and I are just in the back office really enjoying listening to how much of a  crush you have on Rob.  Well, there's two things going on, okay?  Obviously, I have a crush on Rob.  You really do.  He's a ham...  Travis, look around this room.  He's a good-looking guy.  Look around this room.  Yeah.  There's one guy in here who is remarkably better-looking than anyone else.  Well, thank you, but, you know...  It's not you.  Oh.  And I said guy.  So that's where you're wrong on both counts.  Rob, everybody knows that. 
[00:29:30]  However, yesterday when I said, hey, did you meet the new interns yesterday?  Mm-hmm.  The first words out of your mouth were, yeah, one of them is really good-looking.  Well, he's remarkably handsome.  Thanks, man.  You don't think...  That means a lot.  Is that uncomfortable to you?  No, not at all.  Because I don't want it to become an HR issue.  That's not what it's about.  I don't do all guys high school.  It's all good.  Right.  You've been in situations where it gets lonely and you do what you got to do.  Exactly.  Did you ever play, like, Ookie Cookie or any of those guy school games? 
[00:30:00]  No, it's just...  You never once?  No, just, like, where's your junk or...  What's where's your junk?  You just shut off the lights and have your hands...  No, you didn't play that game.  Weren't Danny and I thinking about doing that?  Okay, so how does where's your junk work?  Explain it to me, Rob.  Well, you, like, you shut off all the lights and you can't lift your arms up.  No, no.  And it's pitch black.  Is this, like, in a locker room or something?  Yeah.  Okay.  And you just walk around?  It's a good time.  And so it's...  Wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  I still...  It's pitch black.  And your hands are by your sides. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And you're nude?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  Okay, so what do you...  What do you...  Well, like, once you, like, grab a little something-something...  Well, are you walking around?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, okay, so your hands...  How many guys?  Uh, usually ranging from, like, six to ten.  Okay, so it's a party.  Yeah.  So your hands are by your sides, but you're kind of reaching out and grabbing without moving  your arms.  Yeah, it'd be, like, after gym class or something like that.  Sure.  Sure.  Maybe you got a free period or something.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, I gotcha.  Like, I would have lunch. 
[00:31:00]  You guys would play grab ass or whatever it is.  What was the game called?  Uh, I forget.  Where's your junk?  Where's your junk?  And so you go around, and you keep your arms by your sides, but you grab your friend's  packages.  Yeah.  And then...  Mm-hmm.  That's the game.  Pretty much.  How do you win?  Well, if you got your junk grabbed, then you'd sit out.  You're out.  You're out.  Okay.  Aw.  Well, how do you keep it honest is the only thing, if all the lights are out.  Let's see.  What if there's one guy who's just like, no, I'm gonna go for a second and a third grab. 
[00:31:30]  How many is the most junks that you've grabbed in one game?  Oh, I've won it a couple times.  You have?  Yeah.  So you're like a professional.  I mean, I won't go that far.  I'm gonna say, listen, I know we're thinking about doing live venue gigs and stuff.  I'm just gonna throw this out there.  Some blindfolds.  Where's your junk?  Where's your junk in front of a live audience?  Maybe a little credit card swipe?  Have you guys ever played Where's Your Junk?  Uh, no.  Kevin, have you ever...  I've never had the pleasure.  Have you ever heard of it? 
[00:32:00]  No, actually.  Has...  Are you surprised that...  Yeah, a little.  People weren't...  I'm rethinking my crush, by the way.  We've all got our games that we used to play.  Well, listen.  Nightcrawlers.  What's Nightcrawlers?  It's when...  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, so it's not a real game.  He didn't play it.  It's not...  He's not drawing from experience.  No, we haven't made it, though.  He's drawing from the experience of sitting on his couch and nagging out one.  Just watching.  What about, like, credit card swipe?  What's credit card swipe?  I bet I can guess.  I know. 
[00:32:30]  Ideas are forming.  Well, this is like a whole day game.  Right.  Like, in school, when we'd walk to, like, class to class, we'd, like, go right up the  ass.  With what?  With what?  Well, with either, like, a book or your hand.  Okay, so credit card swipe is you're at an all-guys school, and you walk up and down  the halls trying to shove your hand up your friend's ass.  Is that kind of the game?  Yeah, pretty much.  And what?  You lose the game if there's a hand swiped up your ass crack?  No, you just keep how many points you get.  Like, how many credit cards you go through. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, and so whoever, at the end of the day, whoever's had the most swipes, it's like,  I win.  I think Sal's played credit card swipe.  No, no.  My question is, these are two games you guys played.  What do you get if you win?  What's the reward?  Sal, you just suck your hand up the most amount.  You just get to call the other guy a faggot.  Right.  The other guy.  The other guy, of course.  All right.  All right.  Fair enough, fair enough.  What you need to understand, sometimes in life, the journey is the reward.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's the fact that you are the winner, and your prize is your experience. 
[00:33:30]  You don't need anything in reward.  Like, I just got to grab six junks.  That's the reward.  That's the prize.  And you get to brag to everybody.  You get to brag to everybody.  You get to come on the radio and be like, guess what I did?  Six junks.  Six junks.  So that's what you guys would do in high school?  I mean, it'd be like once a week, maybe.  Not once a week.  Okay.  So nothing crazy or anything.  Just like one homoerotic game a week.  Yeah, exactly.  Okay.  One out of five days.  Right.  Now, was there any one out of five?  It was just like one-fifth of the time we were doing this. 
[00:34:00]  Was there any female interaction in high school, or was it mainly you were occupied with these games?  Yeah, there were a lot of-  Because I would assume that you're not going to win if you don't go home and practice.  Well, no.  I mean, like, a lot of cheerleaders and just, like, girls would just come to-  Yeah, I don't believe that.  I swear.  I think you're lying about that.  So I don't-  Yeah.  Well, like, you know, cheerleaders and models and hot chicks and Sports Illustrated and football and- 
[00:34:30]  Good looking.  And saying they were girls.  You don't have to be good looking to be a cheerleader.  Is that right, Kevin?  You don't.  Yeah.  How do you know that?  My school is the prime example.  My high school.  A lot of ugly cheerleaders in your-  Actually, my college, too.  They're even uglier.  A lot of ugly cheerleaders at your college.  Yes, there is.  A lot of ugly broadcasters at the college radio station.  Actually, some of them are all right.  All right.  I can think of one.  Are you on WSOU?  Are you on SOU?  Yeah.  It's kind of impressive.  That's what Eric said.  That's, like, a legit-  That's a big college radio station.  Yeah?  So maybe you should be a broadcaster. 
[00:35:00]  It's the biggest metal station in the world.  Yeah.  They play good, like, post-hardcore and stuff.  Yeah.  It's the biggest metal station in the world.  Why don't you tell-  There's really no metal stations, though.  What about Liquid Metal?  What about Ozzy's Boneyard?  We're better than them.  Whoa!  Isolated.  Tell that to Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  They're as legit as you get as far as a college radio station goes.  Well, we're going to have to tell Jose that he is willing to put up the metal show on-  What's the station?  WSOU.  WSOU against Liquid Metal any day of the week. 
[00:35:30]  Go ahead.  Have you heard Liquid Metal?  Yeah.  And you know it's not as good?  Well, I am.  It's a good station.  Are you a metal DJ?  I do.  What do you DJ?  What's your-  I-  The whole thing is all metal, but I'm more-  Oh, it's just a metal station?  Yeah, it is just a metal station.  Oh, okay.  I stay more with hard rock and stuff you can actually understand the lyrics to, rather  than, like-  Sounds like a shot.  Yeah, a shot at Troy.  Sounds like a shot at Troy to me. 
[00:36:00]  Liquid Metal actually plays a lot of stuff that's, like, really good, and you can-  It's, like, coherent.  What do you think of the jocks on Liquid Metal?  I don't really-  Like, I've never really, like, listened to it and paid attention to the jocks.  I haven't had Sirius in a while.  Oh, I see.  I see.  Do you have a daily show or a weekly show?  I have a weekly show.  How long?  Three hours.  Pretty good.  Then I have a specialty show that I'm retaking over in July that plays more mainstream and  alternative.  It sounds like you actually might have some stuff going on. 
[00:36:30]  I do have some stuff going on.  I'm telling you, it's not an easy station to get a gig at.  Yeah.  It's a real, legit station.  He's not on the schedule, though.  Oh.  You had a shift yesterday, right?  Yeah, I did.  At what time?  One to four.  All right.  There's somebody named Jay Lopez.  Is that your radio name?  Hola!  What's your Jay Lopez voice?  I didn't come in until, like, 1.30, though, if you were listening before that.  But the schedule-  What's he talking about?  The schedule on the site here says, here are the jocks and the jocks. 
[00:37:00]  Way to go.  What are you looking at?  Your website, the website for your radio station.  Then that must have been for the spring semester, because I'm definitely-  It says Wednesday, May 30th.  What year, Eric?  2012.  That's this year.  I have no idea.  Right.  Because I really think DJ won the four on Wednesday.  Is he just sitting in a room talking?  No, I'm sure he did.  I gotta go.  I'm a showman.  He's in his dorm room.  I don't even know who Jay Lopez is.  Hey, it's me, Kevin. 
[00:37:30]  A.K.A. Jay Lopez.  So, you definitely-  Is this a new show for you?  I just got-  I used to do overnights.  Last semester, when were you on?  Last semester, I was 12 to 3 on Wednesday.  Check if he's 12 to 3.  Okay.  See if they haven't updated their schedule.  Yeah, maybe I got the old schedule.  Yeah.  Instead of being like, what are you talking about?  Websites?  What is this, the future?  Uh, it only goes back to the beginning of May.  Yeah, but I mean, can you-  No, no, no.  Check yesterday, Wednesday, and see who's on the schedule for 12 to 3. 
[00:38:00]  Jay Lopez?  Because that's his radio name.  Meadow.  At 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon.  No, 12 a.m.  Oh, 12 a.m.  You gotta listen with both of these.  It's Aaron O'Grady.  Aaron O'Grady, do an Irish thing?  Aaron O'Grady is the programming.  Hey!  You doing like an Irish, like, metal shell?  Little Irish chick.  Unless they count it going into Thursday, in that case-  That is going into Thursday.  It's somebody named BD.  Are you BD?  That he was-  B-A-T-Y.  B-A-T-Y. 
[00:38:30]  Big day.  Wait, check.  BD, Kevin.  All right, that doesn't matter.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Kevin knows all the jocks that are on that station.  I believe that you're on the station.  I believe he's on the station.  I believe you're on the station.  Uh-oh.  Congratulations for making it.  Now, uh, Connor.  Do you feel a little like, oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I just saw that, too.  Maybe Kevin over here is not quite the, uh, schlub I thought he was.  Maybe Kevin is putting on a ruse, and he's actually got, like, a pretty nice thing. 
[00:39:00]  Is that something you could put on a resume?  Absolutely.  That's the only reason why I got this, probably.  No, the only reason you got it is because Eric thought your interview was funny.  Now, now, now, Connor.  Yeah.  Does that make you think, oh, boy, I gotta work a little tougher?  Not really.  See, I think, here's what I think about Connor.  I think Rob is kind of, he's just in it for the ride.  He's hoping some kind of gay stuff happens that he can get away with.  Rob is, Rob is, uh, confident, bordering on cocky. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Which you gotta be careful.  But he is Marv Albert.  Like, he's gonna be a sportscaster with this horrible scandal.  I bet he's got a lot of good stories.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, Kevin, he's like a little E-Rock.  Like, he's actually a little, like, schlubby radio guy.  And, and he may be a dark horse.  Yeah.  And I think Connor does the whole, like, well, you know, I don't like to toot my own horn  type of thing.  Connor's sitting in the office at five o'clock when I walk in, so who knows what time he  gets here. 
[00:40:00]  So he might be, you know.  I get here at, like, five.  How come?  Uh, because the buses don't run.  Oh, okay.  Now, are you a little worried?  Do you look at this as a competition?  Not really.  Not at all.  You should.  No, I don't look at it as a competition.  Why not?  Because his station didn't win, uh, IBS this year.  We did.  Whoa!  We did.  We did.  Now, IBS, yeah, irritable bowel syndrome.  Intercollegiate broadcasting systems.  Ouch.  Last year, he almost won the college Woody for best radio station.  That's the MTV award. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  We won, um...  That's big.  We were in the top four last year.  Okay.  MTV is bigger than irritable bowel syndrome.  That's true.  So...  We won, um, best station in the nation with enrollment over 10,000.  Do you have a show on it?  We won best station by Playboy.  You have two and a half?  Two and a half.  I share one with somebody.  Couldn't be that impressive, then.  Listen.  We gotta go.  The show's already over.  All right.  I hope you guys have enjoyed, you know, having the audience get to know you a little better.  Rob?  This is a good crap.  Keep it up, my friend.  It'll be sad.  I might crash your wedding.  Maybe I'll be that one who comes in and says, no. 
[00:41:00]  Rob, this is where he lost it.  No, Rob.  Damn.  Rob can't come to the wedding because he's too big of a temptation.  I just blow the whole thing off.  Maybe that's what you're doing.  A little, you know, like pre-wedding jitters.  You're all like, ooh.  Yeah.  I'm going to be up, like, you know, reading my vows and all of a sudden, credit card swive.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
