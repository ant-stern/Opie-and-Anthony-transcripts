<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous exploration of Russ Meyer's topless films, specifically *Mondo Topless*.  The hosts played numerous clips, focusing on Meyer's outrageous and sexually suggestive narration of San Francisco landmarks and the women featured.  They discussed the historical context of the films, contrasting early pornography with modern examples.  The segment included many explicit descriptions and vulgar terms from Meyer's narration.

Following this, Lady Die, a frequent caller known for her chaotic stories, called in.  She provided a life update, mentioning she was no longer homeless but still drank occasionally and her son remained in her father's care.  A substantial portion of her call involved the suicide of her former husband, a topic the hosts repeatedly joked about despite Lady Die's discomfort.  During this segment, Drew Boogie, Bill Burr, and Pamela (a MacBook karaoke contest winner) were present in the studio. Pamela briefly performed and discussed her post-contest experiences.  Numerous advertisements aired throughout.

Next, Pamela, from Deer Park, Long Island, performed a cappella versions of "I Swore the Sign" and Alanis Morissette's "You Oughta Know." The hosts commented on her performance and Long Island background, with Louis C.K. suggesting (and the hosts agreeing to) removing the backing music to showcase her talent.  Discussions included possible future performances for her, potentially at FH Riley's.

Following Pamela's performance, Anthony donned a Nazi helmet provided by a listener.  This sparked a discussion and jokes about Nazi imagery, culminating in a filmed "challenge" between Anthony (wearing the helmet) and Patrice (a black man) to see who could hail a cab first in New York City. The hosts commented on the cab drivers' reactions and perceived biases.  This was interspersed with more advertisements.


The show then transitioned to a chaotic eggnog drinking contest.  Several contestants, including "Dug out, Dug," Shane, John, and later Pat Ruminaki and Jerry Generoso, participated, with frequent vomiting, often out of their noses.  A pivotal moment involved Sergeant Magoo vomiting into a pitcher, adding Froot Loops, and consuming the mixture.  This caused multiple bystanders, including E-Rock, to become violently ill, with E-Rock vomiting repeatedly and eventually using a garbage can.  Intern Pat Duffy also consumed the mixture, resulting in more vomiting, primarily from E-Rock. A bidding war ensued for another sip of Magoo's concoction. Pat Ruminaki ultimately won, consuming 75 double shots and subsequently vomiting a large amount onto Pat Duffy (who had volunteered to receive it).  The hosts and guests described the event as a "greatest moment in radio history," and the event was filmed and uploaded online. Bill Burr was mentioned as being present during this segment as well.  Listener calls reacted to the broadcast's events.

The next segment featured Patrice O'Neal recounting a bizarre encounter at a McDonald's rest stop, where a well-dressed man repeatedly said "It's cold out here" and attempted his door handle, leading to speculation about a possible gay encounter. This led to comedic creation of a "gay code" around the phrase.  The discussion then shifted to *Snakes on a Plane*, with the hosts and callers making numerous jokes and speculations, using offensive language and stereotypes.  They created absurd movie titles like "Birds in a Car" and "Sharks in the Post Office."  A short, pre-recorded interview with Samuel L. Jackson about the film was played.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Bill Burr's stand-up performance at the Tweeter Center, where he was booed and responded with a 12-minute expletive-laden rant at the audience, insulting Philadelphia. Clips of the rant were played, with profanity bleeped.  Callers shared their opinions on the event.

A later segment revisited Bill Burr's Camden performance, with the hosts and callers discussing the heckling, Burr's aggressive response, and his eventual triumph over the crowd. Burr himself was in studio, providing his perspective.  Listeners described the performance and shared their experiences. The show then transitioned to a less-successful "walk-over" segment with Ron and Fez, attempting a live broadcast from the streets of New York.

The final segment focused heavily on Rich Vos's smoking habit. The hosts and guests urged him to quit, with Vos offering unconvincing plans. The conversation included tangents about Vos's stand-up comedy (including a caller's review of his Sacramento show), his relationship with his wife Bonnie, secondhand smoke and the death of Dana Reeves, and a listener's story about a family member's oral cancer. Colin Quinn joined the show, adding comedic commentary and criticizing Vos.  Discussions also touched upon Vos's conspiracy theories and sexual behavior. Vos ultimately set a new quit date (April 22nd), with continued discussion of "laser therapy" for smoking cessation. The show concluded with further humorous ribbing of Vos and interspersed advertisements.

[00:12:00]  i love the piano  and that's my favorite  part of that  yeah  awful thing  an old silent movie  piano playing in front  of the screen  he's talking about  sex  he's talking about  girls that are  well endowed  pulsating  over hill and dale  this has nothing to do  with the cable cars  of san francisco  guys trying to make  cable cars sexy  and he did  and the hot  rice-a-roni picture  ad on the back  listen to what he has  to say about  coit tower  san francisco  is a city of  religious respect  and authority 
[00:12:30]  and democratically  there are those  who are in  disagreement  san francisco's  art colony  is dominated  by the arrogant  and imposing  coit tower  thrusting its bulk  majestically  to the sky  with the broadway  tunnel offering  a yawning orifice  through which to  enter fabled  north beach  a yawning orifice  is he talking about  tunnels and  towers  i think he's talking  about some chick  that's passed out 
[00:13:00]  cold  one of his vixens  yeah  and then he finally  starts getting into  the art of the  topless  the art of the  topless  is there art  to topless  the way he puts it  uh  no  the art of the  topless  that just didn't  catch on  unfortunately  all natural girls  too  yeah  you won't find  any implants  in any of his  movies  they're all  natural  fantastic  natural  like the big  teardrops  yep  not a bee  among them  very big  and they run  yeah  they play in the mud

[00:59:30]  you would hardly recognize me  I'm so glad  how good a person  like me  is who you are  forever  when you're not  the one for me  ooh  isn't up and up  I saw the sign  and it opened up  my eyes  I saw the sign  life is demanding 
[01:00:00]  without understanding  I saw the sign  and it opened up  my eyes  I saw the sign  no one's gonna drag you up  to get into the lights  where you belong  but where do you belong  oh yeah  Jimmy this is for you  ah I love it  singing it  under the clean moon  for so many years  I've wondered who you are 
[01:00:30]  how could a person  like you  bring me  under the pale moon  where I see  a lot of stars  ooh  is enough enough  I saw the sign  and it opened up  my eyes  I saw the sign  life is demanding  without understanding  I saw the sign  and it opened up  my eyes  I saw the sign  no one's gonna drag you up 
[01:01:00]  to get into the lights  where you belong  but where do you belong  oh  oh  oh  yeah  you like that  it stinks  yeah  yeah  yeah  holy  nice  nice  I saw the sign  and it opened up my eyes 
[01:01:30]  and I am happy  not living without you  I left you  oh  oh  oh  I saw the sign  and it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  no one's gonna drag you up  to get into the lights  where you  below  I saw the sign  I saw the sign  I saw the sign  I saw the sign  I saw the sign  I saw the sign  I saw the sign  I saw the sign  I saw the sign 
[01:02:00]  and it opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  sign  sign  oh my god  oh wow  wow  Look how many people are in here.  Everyone wanted to see her.  She's a star.  Everyone wanted to see it live.  Pamela from the park.  I saw the sign.  That is good.  I'll tell you, the next road show we do, you're going to have to do that live in front of everybody.  Absolutely.  You'll be a huge hit.  Can I wear a shiny costume or something?  Oh, yeah.  Please.  You can wear whatever you want. 
[01:02:30]  Please do that.  Actually, we're going to do late night karaoke at probably FH Riley's in January or early February.  You come down and do it live.  I'll clear my schedule.  Halfway through that, Louis C.K. came over and said, take off your headphones.  It is ten times funnier without the music.  So I took it off.  I heard not a stitch of music.  All you could hear was her vocals, and it is classic.  It's beautiful.  You hear her breathing between you and all this stuff.  Yeah, everything.  It's so good. 
[01:03:00]  All the nuances without music are phenomenal.  With that said, where's Tim?  Is there any way she could hear the music in the headphones, but it doesn't go over the air,  so we could just isolate her voice?  Yeah, I hope that was...  Can't you hear that?  I hope that was...  I'm sure that's doable.  We're going to be able to separate it.  Oh, yeah.  The Linda McCartney cut we need.  You know what?  I really love it, though, because she's so sincere.  She's really sick.  Yeah, she's getting into it.  Totally.  I really feel it.  It comes from the heart.  Is that one of your favorites?  That's what it feels like.  It's a very generous performance. 
[01:03:30]  I mean that.  Is that one of your favorites?  It's all right.  I've had requests to do other songs from the MySpace stalkers.  What's your favorite song to do?  The other night I did You Ought to Know by Alanis Morissette.  Wow.  That was pretty intense.  Do we have that?  Love to hear that.  Wow.  Could you sing it a cappella?  Kind of, probably.  Okay, let's hear it.  I want you to know I'm happy for you.  I wish nothing but the best for you both. 
[01:04:00]  An older version of me.  Is she perverted like me?  Would she go down on you in a theater?  That's kind of a sample.  The bathroom's over there.  Damn good.  That one's behind him.  Yeah, that song one, it gets kind of crazy.  I don't know.  Everyone's like, you need to put out an album or something.  I don't know.  Well, sure.  Who are these, everyone?  That was just a tease, just a little sample.  Yeah, a little sample.  We're trying to figure out.  Like Sinatra. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  We're trying to figure out somewhere.  That's all you need.  We're trying to figure out where she can hear the music and then we just have her vocals  on the air and that's it.  That's pretty great.  It's pretty great according to Louis C.K., huh?  Oh, yeah.  We're doing it over here.  You should just be doing concerts.  That's all you should do.  Yeah, maybe I'll go on tour.  We can go on tour together.  You're just there.  No, I'd follow you.  Yes, you could.  No, you could not follow her.  No.  Just a student.  You don't have a little part-time job or something like that?  I am a music director, actually, at my college radio station.  Oh, yeah.  Wow. 
[01:05:00]  I usually pick the music, not sing it.  All right.  I think we got this figured out.  Wait, how is she going to...  Oh, I just hit it from here?  Yeah, and play it from this.  I got you.  Okay.  Oh, then it's going direct from the CD player, but not over the air.  Louis C.K. came up with this suggestion.  We'll see if it works.  You're going to sing the song again.  Just do it.  Sing it like you always do.  Yeah.  Don't give me a lot of laughing.  Just try to plow through it, okay?  You ready?  From the top?  From the top, yes.  From the top.  All right.  Only she will be hearing the music, hopefully. 
[01:05:30]  That's right.  All right.  She's got it.  Cool.  Cool.  I'm dancing.  I got a new life. 
[01:06:00]  You can hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad.  How could a person like me?  Why do I bother when you're not the one for me?  Sounds like Manina.  Is enough enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding without understanding. 
[01:06:30]  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  But where do you belong?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woo.  Ah.  Under the clean moon.  For so many years.  I've wondered who you are. 
[01:07:00]  How could a person like you bring me?  Where a pale moon.  Where I see a lot of stars.  Ooh.  Is enough enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong. 
[01:07:30]  But where do you belong?  Ah.  Yeah.  I love you guys so much.  I'm really feeling it right now.  I can't explain.  Oh my God.  He's dancing.  Yeah.  No.  I like this.  Hearing the music.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes. 
[01:08:00]  And I am happy not living without you.  I left you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign. 
[01:08:30]  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  There you go.  Pamela from Deer Park.  Wow.  That's the most committed thing I've ever seen.  That was tremendous.  That was unbelievable.  Louis C.K.  Great idea.  110 percent.  Get that video up on YouTube immediately.  She went 110 percent with that one.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I think that time was better than the first, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  You were warmed up.  You were warmed up. 
[01:09:00]  Take two is definitely the one to go with.  Oh, yeah.  Who's going to argue that?  That's why they said one for safety.  You know?  Everyone's going, she's in college?  Yeah, well.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  Thank you, Pamela.  You're welcome.  We'll have you do that live at the next O&A event, okay?  Please.  Yeah.  Stay tuned.

[01:13:30]  Sir, I'm doing a radio show, but at any time that...  Wait, who are you?  What do you got?  It's a real...  For your collection.  Oh, oh, oh, my God.  Take off your hat, Ann.  I cannot wear a nasty helmet.  First of all...  The whole way.  That has fucking Hitler's...  Hitler's hair is in that motherfucker.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I hope you get World War II lice. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, no, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I'll do the walk with my Nazi helmet on.  This is the real thing?  That's the real deal, yeah.  I got it.  It swapped me like 30 years ago.  Wow.  I got the guy's name in the helmet.  I smell Cyclone B in it.  It's just a hat.  It's the matter.  It's just a hat, right?  Good for you.  Hey, let him walk ahead.  Goof, I hope you get Third Reich itch, motherfucker, 
[01:14:30]  for wearing some strange Nazi hat.  Hey, Patrice, let him walk ahead.  There's Nazi lice in the helmet.  Yeah, see, look.  It's a brotherhood.  It's a brotherhood.  Wow.  You're crazy, Ann.  You're crazy.  How you doing?  What's happening, baby?  How you doing?  Look at the cops are stopping going...  A swastika on a helmet!  A swastika!  I know there's a little swastika on the side.  Come on. 
[01:15:00]  It's not like a Mel Gibson or nothing.  Oh, my God.  Did he give you that hat?  Yeah.  That's fucking genius.  Wow.  This I'll take home to my neighborhood.  They'll love it.  I'll put it on the mantle.  Do you got lampshades, too, you dick?  You what?  I actually had to use it as a helmet one day.  For what?  I was out with my friend the night before I left my helmet in his car,  and I had to get to work.  The only way was to use that.  Well, that's fantastic.  Anthony?  Is anyone in New York even noticing or caring that I'm wearing a Nazi helmet?  No. 
[01:15:30]  That's the beauty of New York City.  Not one look.  No one really cares.  I guess you wear the Nazi helmet to XM.  How you doing?  Anthony, you've got to mow your lawn with that hat on.  Should I, like, mow my lawn in my neighborhood?  Well, let me look at the reflection.  This is really...  Holy shit.  Oh, is that awful?  No shit.  You can bring him up.  Oh, is that horrible?  How you doing?  Guten Tag. 
[01:16:00]  Wow, they're all just bothered.  All these people are bothered because we've got a big crowd today.  We're blocking the way as we walk.  We are the niggas.  Not one person has noticed that he's wearing that.  No, no one really...  It's New York, so...  Yeah.  No one really cares.  Isn't that amazing?  No one even looking.  No one is looking twice.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute, Anthony.  Do this.  Hey, Anthony.  Wait.  Thank you, sir.  Give somebody the mic.  He's just walking away.  He gave you a World War II helmet and you're walking away. 
[01:16:30]  Isn't that great?  Hey, listen.  Give somebody the mic, right?  And just walk without being...  Without everybody.  Just cross the street without everybody and see if anybody noticed you have a fucking  World War...  A Nazi hat on.  Yeah.  Just get...  Just cross the street, Anthony, and see if anybody...  Because no one's looking because there's too many fucking people around.  Go this way.  Go that way.  Let Anthony go by himself first.  Just let him go by himself.  There he goes.  Let him go by himself, camera guy.  Okay, so the camera follows. 
[01:17:00]  Well...  He has to walk by himself.  But everyone just looks down.  They don't notice crap in New York City.  He has a fucking Nazi helmet on.  One day we got to get something.  I got a chuckle out of an old guy who kind of looked like, what the fuck?  Because he almost called you...  Hey, what's happening now?  Remember you?  Hey, man.  Hey, one day we got to have someone just walk completely naked to see if these people  notice anything.  They'll notice naked.  You think they'll notice naked?  They'll notice naked, but not Nazi hat.  Oh, this lady noticed his Nazi hat. 
[01:17:30]  Uh-oh.  She looks like Wiesenthal's daughter.  Oh, my God.  That is not right.  He's just walking across the street with the Nazi helmet on with, yes, the logo on the  side.  That needs to be covered up with a wow sticker or something because that's not right.  Get the Yankee emblem on that damn thing quick.  I'm trying to find, like, Jewish people, because I figured they would probably be the most 
[01:18:00]  offended.  All right.  Let's go to Pick-A-Bagel.  Let's go to Pick-A-Bagel.  We'll get some stairs in there.  Wouldn't that be weird if I ordered a bagel with a little schmear?  Oh, hey, hey, Anthony.  Bust up.  Bust up.  Hey, Anthony, hail a cab.  Anthony, hail a cab.  Hail a cab.  Wait a minute.  Go on.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Anthony, hail a cab. 
[01:18:30]  Hail a cab.  Hail a cab.  Here's one coming.  Here's one coming right now.  Here's one.  All right, watch.  This is a photo op for everybody.  Hey, the guy stopped.  He kept going.  Shit, I got to hail a cab.  All right, get over there.  Shit.  Right over there.  Oh, my God, no.  This is not right.  The cab is stopping.  Get in.  Get in.  Get in.  Get in.  Get in.  Ant, Ant, you got to get in one of these. 
[01:19:00]  Where am I going?  Just freaking just go the half a block and give the guy five bucks.  All right.  All right, Anthony's going to hail a cab to the...  I got to hail a cab.  To XM.  I need a cab.  All right, we got cabs coming this way.  Oh, here comes one.  Oh, he's turning.  Shit.  All right, get your cameras out.  This is going to be a photo op.  Anthony hailing a cab.  To XM.  There's Anthony.  That's so not right.  That is so not right. 
[01:19:30]  No, you got to wait.  Oh, here's one.  Here's one.  Here it is.  Here it is.  And make sure you get in.  You got to get in.  You got to get in.  All right, get in.  Get in, Ant.  Get in.  All right, we'll see you, Anthony, at XM.  He has held a cab with his Nazi helmet on, and there goes Anthony.  Take me to Berlin.  That's pretty fucking funny, man.  That is fucking hilarious.  Hail a cab was genius. 
[01:20:00]  Hail a cab, Steve.  I know.  You came up with it.  Yeah, Steve.  That was my TV, man.  You got the other one?  That was just jumping in.  All right.  Wait till you see these pictures on opandanthony.com.  Holy crap.  And you know Arabs are pulling over with that shit.  They're like, hell yeah.  One of the best walkovers ever.  Anthony and a Nazi helmet yelling a cab.  That's not right.  Oh, shit.  Where is he?  Do they let him out, or is he up the street? 
[01:20:30]  How do they have this kid dressed?  Holy shit.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  All right.  Where is he?  He took that fucking cab.  Did they take him away?  I'm going to Berlin.  I'm going to Berlin.  He's way up the sidewalk.  That helmet is genius.  That fucking guy gave him an official World War II helmet, man. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  It's the real deal.  Where is that guy?  He left?  He left.  Yeah, he just took a left turn and left.  All right.  Anthony's making his way back up the sidewalk here.  Anthony, genius.  That cab driver was laughing his ass off.  Oh, man.  How awful.  A couple didn't want to pick me up.  I wonder why.  Goddamn.  Whose idea was that? 
[01:21:30]  Steve.  Steve.  Was that Steve?  Got to give credit where credit's due, man.  Hail a cab.  Everyone left, so it looks like they're going to be outside for this.  Yeah.  We going to do this?  Yeah, Patrice, I thought you were getting your gold on.  You're getting your bling on.  You just got to pull it out from his shirt.  Oh, you just have to pull it out from his shirt.  Stupid white boy that I am.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  We're going to attempt.  All that was hidden?  Oh, my God. 
[01:22:00]  We're going to attempt Nigga versus Nazi.  The Nigga Nazi Cab Challenge.  The Nigga Nazi Cab Challenge 2006.  I will be putting on a Nazi helmet.  Yeah.  And trying to hail a cab with the Sigh Heil arm.  Don't you got that other thing that the guy gave you yesterday from Pittsburgh?  What thing is that?  What was it?  The what?  It was like a hazmat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is like olive drab, isn't it? 
[01:22:30]  Hmm.  I don't know.  No, I think you and just the helmet.  Just the helmet?  Yeah, that might save our jobs.  Because they'll say, look, he was just acting silly.  It's a helmet someone gave me.  It's silly.  It's silly.  And I'll try to hail the cab.  Patrice will be before me in traffic.  Right.  So the cab will get first dibs at Patrice.  Yeah.  If he passes Patrice and picks up me, the Nazi, then there's a problem. 
[01:23:00]  And we want to do best out of five?  Best out of five.  Or best out of seven.  I'd like to hide a better.  We'll see how it goes.  We could go NBA rules.  Want to go NBA?  NBA finals?  We'll see how it goes.  All right.  Oh, crap.  No, Dan.  Jesus Christ.  Will you hide that immediately?  What is wrong with you?  That is a giant flag with a swastika on it.  You should tie that around your neck like a cape.  A cape.  Put it on me like a cape.  Let's see how we look at least. 
[01:23:30]  Anthony, you've got to tie that around your neck.  You know, I was thinking I might want to run for office at some point in my life, but...  No, you're not.  No, no.  Your sex with Sam wrecked that.  Because when we blow up our careers again, Anthony's going to go into the professional talk show world.  It's okay, I'm going to...  It's going to be like the next Sean Hannity.  But I'm going to be like, yeah, I'm going to do O'Reilly or something.  So this is fine.  It's purely acceptable.  All right.  In that genre.  Yeah, I don't know if I could wear the big flag as a... 
[01:24:00]  No, the helmet's good enough, trust me.  As a cape.  Okay.  Looks so silly.  The cape juicator.  And you'll be doing the move, so you'll be all right.  Yeah, I'll be doing the move.  Yeah.  All right, want to do this?  Are we going to stand on the same side of the street?  Yeah, we've got to be the same side of the street.  You get the cab coming toward you first, though, because you've got to be the guy that they  pass up for me, because everybody knows how hard it is for a black guy to get a cab in  New York City, because they always think you want to go uptown and jack them.  Oh, yeah, we've got to go on 6th Avenue, too.  We've got to do it on 6th Avenue. 
[01:24:30]  We're going to do it on 6th?  I was thinking 57th, right there out in front.  Oh, um...  No, 6th because...  6th because, um...  It's heading north.  Yeah, they think that I'm going uptown.  It's heading north.  They think you're going up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Because going...  I'm just telling you...  That might give Anthony an unfair advantage.  I'm giving the field research, I'm saying, is that when I'm going down, when I'm pointing  down at a certain level in terms of, like, 60th, and I'm going down, they tend to pick 
[01:25:00]  me up because they think I'm not going...  I'm staying in Manhattan.  And then you tell the cabbie, you U-turned it, motherfucker.  And I go, I'm going to the Bronx, bitch!  You trick him.  You fucked up.  You trick him.  I'm just thinking if they see me on 6th over there, they might think I just work at, like,  Jekyll and Hyde's or something.  Fucking Patrice probably...  They kind of have that kind of stuff over there, don't they?  Fucking Pat...  I didn't...  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you yet.  I was just thinking, fucking Patrice probably puts, like, the Knicks jersey on, the Knicks  cap, heads, like, makes it look like he's heading toward Madison Square Garden for the 
[01:25:30]  big game, and all of a sudden, he's like, I'm 34th Street.  I'm going to the Bronx, motherfucker.  With a big foam number one finger.  As soon as you get in, you're like, fuck that.  Fuck you, bitch!  I'm going to the Bronx.  So people betting out there?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, they're more paranoid than anything.  Yeah, people are scared.  They should wear the mustache.  Oh, the mustache.  All right. 
[01:26:00]  Are we going to do this or what?  Let's go.  Yeah, I think we should.  Where's Anthony?  I just saw a picture of us go by on the bus.  Oh, really?  They're going to be ripping those down soon.  Where are you, Ant?  I'm down right in front of the doorway.  I'm in the elevator.  Waiting for you to come down so you could observe.  Give a little play-by-play.  I am out here with Patrice, who has turned his hat a little sideways. 
[01:26:30]  He was practicing how he's going to hail the cab in the mirror in the elevator.  And in very intimidating fashion, it barely looks like he's doing anything.  It looks like he's going to rob the...  Oh, sorry, I'm distracted.  The guy is kicking us out of the doorway.  My God.  You'd think a Nazi could stand in a doorway of a building here in a free nation like the United States of America.  So we're going to go...  Yeah, we're going to go...  You're going to have to be first. 
[01:27:00]  And I'll probably be, like, right here.  So we're going to do it here or are we going to do it at 6th Ave?  I think we should just do it here.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, there goes a cab.  There are a lot of cabs available, which is good.  But you should go down a little further.  And then we have to put our mics down and Opie will describe the scene because we don't want them to look like the cabs to think that this is some kind of ruse or something.  Well, these people are going to wreck it.  They've got to stay up here. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, tell them to come this way.  Yeah, you guys stay up here, please.  All right, we're going down.  Yeah, we'll go down.  You go down by the corner a little bit, Patrice, and I'll stand kind of by the phone booth.  All right, we're setting this up.  What are we doing?  Best of seven?  Yeah, best of seven.  Best of seven.  Hold your mic down.  Anthony, if you're just holding it.  What?  Just so I can get some kind of sound from you guys, just kind of have the mics held.  Yeah, you've got to be a little bit closer to me so he can see you. 
[01:28:00]  He can see you from there.  Yeah, oh, he'll see me, though.  He'll see me.  I'm going to sit on the planter here.  Wait in.  Here comes a bus.  After the bus passes, game on.  And I think you need to be a little closer.  I think you need to be where the bus is after the bus passes.  Yeah, you've got to be closer to me.  Because the cab has to see both of you at the same time.  All right.  And then make that decision.  Okay.  Because it's almost weird close.  Close.  Like with his fucking, like here. 
[01:28:30]  Well, then they're going to think that you're both together.  Yeah, yeah.  I like this distance.  I would never pick up a nigga and a Nazi.  All right.  For you at home, these guys are like a bus length apart.  Yeah.  You've got Patrice all ghettoed out.  Patrice, you look downright scary.  All right.  The second this thing goes by, now we've got to start.  And Anthony with his Nazi helmet.  Game on.  As soon as that light turns green, game on.  Yes.  Stand like this. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  Patrice has his arm up.  Ant, get your arm up.  Thank you, sir.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  There's a cab.  He's confused.  He's stopped.  He has passed.  He has passed?  Oh, Nazi.  Nazi.  Fucking.  Why didn't you pick up the African gentleman?  You motherfucker.  I stopped.  You see me.  I stopped.  You didn't stop for a nigga.  You stopped to pick up the African gentleman.  But then you put.  You see that I'm a Nazi. 
[01:29:30]  You didn't stop for the Nazi.  You picked up a Nazi over a nigga.  I stopped.  I stopped.  And you see me stopping, right?  I stopped.  And I see maybe you don't want to.  You chose the Nazi brother.  You chose Nazi over a nigga.  You chose the Nazi brother.  Wow.  Come on, brother.  You don't pick up a fucking Nazi.  All right, Patrice.  Come here.  Come here.  I got to tell everyone what happened at home.  I'm the eyes of this thing.  So they're like a bus length apart.  Patrice.  It's so obvious Patrice is hailing the cab. 
[01:30:00]  The guy slows down.  Keeps looking at Patrice.  Not sure what to do.  He's thinking, well, I need a fare today.  Then he looks ahead and sees Anthony.  And he speeds up.  Third right.  And picks up Anthony.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  One for Anthony.  One for me.  None for Patrice.  One for the Nazi.  All right, let's get back.  I got up a bitch niggas to pick up a fucking Nazi in this street.  One for the Nazi.  One for the Nazi.  All right.  All right, nigga, going to get a cab.  Let's see how this goes next.  Nazi one, swiggy zero. 
[01:30:30]  All right, here comes another cab.  Here comes another cab.  Start hailing at the same time, guys.  All right, here's the cab.  He's slowing down.  And he has picked up Patrice.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Talk to the brother.  I thought he was going to pass him.  I thought he was going to pass him.  Thanks for stopping, man.  Appreciate that.  Listen, there's a Nazi that needs a cab right there.  No picking up.  No picking up Nazis.  All right.  All right.  Two brothers, too.  We're tied.  We're tied.  Two black guys.  All right, we're tied.  Swiggy one, Nazi one. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Best of seven.  Here comes another cab.  Oh, my God.  The cab sped by both of you all.  He didn't want either.  I had my mic up, too.  That might do it.  Hey, I need a cab.  He passed both of you.  This guy's turning.  Here we go.  All right.  Here comes another cab.  You guys got to, like, hail the cab at the exact same time.  All right.  Their arms are up.  We got Patrice.  We got Anthony. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, look at that.  That's two.  Damn it.  Two to one.  Two to one.  Damn it.  Two to one.  They know.  Danny Glover.  This is because of Danny Glover.  This is all Danny Glover's fault.  Where's a Nazi supposed to get a cab?  All right.  Swiggy two, Nazi one.  And you got to get a little closer.  You're a little too far away now.  A little further.  A little further.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go.  Right there.  That's good.  Stand in the street, Anthony, like you really need it.  I'm going to be kind of like.  All right.  All right. 
[01:32:00]  When the light changes, we got a couple of cabs coming up.  Oh, here comes one.  All right.  Here comes one.  Let's see what happens.  And.  Oh, man.  Now it's a runaway.  Now.  Well.  Well.  The cab is kind of in the middle.  Ask the cabbie who he wants to pick up.  He doesn't know what to do.  Wait.  Wait.  Now he's pushing toward Anthony.  Who do you want to pick up, sir?  Whoever comes in the first door.  Yeah.  I need the cab, man.  Is it the nigger or the Nazi?  Whoever comes first door. 
[01:32:30]  Whoever comes first door.  You kind of hedged your bet.  Nah, he.  Let me tell you something.  This gentleman hedged his bet and pulled right between both of us.  What is that?  A tie?  And then he kind of pushed toward Anthony.  I don't know.  It's.  Patrice has two, right?  I got one.  I say.  And that's a tie.  I don't know.  He started.  He started pushing past Patrice.  He really did slowly start passing Patrice.  Well, you might have to give it to the Nazi.  If I'm the official judge.  I think it's two.  Yeah.  And my helpers here are saying thumbs up to the Nazi. 
[01:33:00]  He made an excuse that he was like.  Whichever.  He was ready to pick up Patrice.  Then he saw you.  Then he hedged his bet.  But then he started inching toward you because I think he didn't want to get in trouble.  This is the tiebreaker, right?  We're going to seven, though.  Best of seven.  We got two for the swiggy and two for the Nazi.  All right.  All right.  We're waiting for the next cab outside XM Satellite Radio.  This guy.  You're trying to figure out what's going on?  You figured it out finally?  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's another cab.  I don't think.  No, he's got people. 
[01:33:30]  He's got people.  Oh, he's got people in there.  All right.  We're waiting.  Two for the swiggy, two for the Nazi.  Patrice is loving this.  And you've got to be a little more aggressive because.  You've got to be aggressive.  And you've got to.  Anthony, move closer a little bit.  There you go.  Right about there.  And get in the street a bit.  There you go.  This is definitely fair.  You've got to be trying to get the cab in.  He is.  He is.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  All right.  Wait for the bus to pass.  Wait for the bus. 
[01:34:00]  Game off.  Alvita zane.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  Two cabs are pissed.  Two to two.  To pick up the Nazi.  Danny Glover is going to be pissed if I win this.  Where's Danny Glover for this bitch?  Hold on.  We're waiting for the bus to pass.  Hold on.  All right.  There it goes.  Hold on.  Let this cab go by because they're letting people out.  Yeah, they're letting people out.  We've got to keep this fair.  Let them go.  Let them go. 
[01:34:30]  All right, Anthony, get back in the street.  All right.  Game back on.  Game on.  Will the cabbie pick up a shwibby or a Nazi?  All right.  We're waiting for a cab.  Don't see nothing.  The light's red.  When it turns green, we'll get a few people, a few cabs driving.  Yeah.  I cannot believe it's two up. 
[01:35:00]  It is two up.  God damn, another bus turning over here.  You better not be stopping.  Oh, I'm trying to catch a cab.  She's trying to catch a cab, sir.  It's a little tough.  Hey, what the hell is this guy doing?  All right.  Hold on with the bus.  Get this bus out of here.  They're ruining our bit.  They're letting someone out.  Letting people off.  All right.  That's all right.  God damn public transportation.  That's all right.  We're killing time anyway.  That's good.  If you're just tuning in, we're trying to see if a cab will stop for a shwibby or a  Nazi.  People are very threatened by Patrice. 
[01:35:30]  You look a little threatening like that.  You put your game face on, man.  You're stuck grabbing yourself.  Hey, Patrice.  Monster house on the side of this bus.  I was just telling you about the movie during the break.  Go see that shit.  The 3D one.  A little 3D action.  It's not bad.  All right.  After this bus passes, we'll get back to the game.  The bus driver is shaking her head at me.  Well, find out.  Find out.  Why is she shaking her head?  How are you doing?  Excuse me, ma'am.  Is there a problem?  You don't appreciate it? 
[01:36:00]  No, she doesn't.  She's not happy.  I'll be the same.  She's not happy with what you just saw.  No.  All right.  Game on.  Here comes the cab.  Here it comes.  Put the mic down.  Go in.  Start hailing.  All right.  Cabby's coming up.  Cabby's coming up.  He's speed.  Another one that's kind of in the middle.  Patrice, what do you think?  Come on.  Patrice, what do you think?  He was going.  He got me.  He wanted me.  He was going.  Oh, he wanted me. 
[01:36:30]  He was going.  And then he thought the...  He was going.  He was fucking taking a Nazi.  Totally taking the Nazi.  He looked like a Nazi.  Do you see him?  Wait, I'm going to the judges.  Nazi or shwoogie?  Nazi.  That was so Nazi.  That was so Nazi.  One more.  I'm going to pull this out.  I'm going to pull this out with niggas.  Wow.  You better pull this out.  Nice.  You better pull this out, man.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, what a comeback.  Fuck.  Wow.  What a comeback the Reich is making.  Patrice just saw a girl with huge tits, and now he doesn't know where he is. 
[01:37:00]  Patrice.  Stay in the game.  Stay in the game.  I'm pulling a Jesse Owens on you, motherfucker.  You better.  All right.  Hold on.  As soon as this bus passes, game back on.  It is three for the Nazi, two for the shwoogie.  What a comeback the Nazis are making.  No.  Ant needs one more, and he takes out the shwoogie.  I need one more, Cam.  And the Nazis will win.  All right.  Here comes the Cam.  Get in there, Ant.  My money's on Ant. 
[01:37:30]  Cam is making the left onto 57th Street.  Here he goes.  He is, oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Thanks, man.  We're on.  Damn.  We're going to game seven.  It's good.  It's going right to game seven.  All right.  Hold on.  Don't hail yet.  I am in the street.  Hold on.  Let's set this up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get in the street.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Jesse Owens.  Wait.  Don't hail this one yet.  Hold on.  Let's set it up.  So, here we go.  The shwoogie's got three. 
[01:38:00]  The Nazis got three.  Wait.  Ready?  Okay.  Ready?  Game on the line.  Okay.  You stand there.  Yeah.  I'm going to come out and wave it before you.  We're going to catch you.  You're going to already be waving, and I'm going to run up, and I'm going to wave to get  right ahead of you.  Okay.  Ready?  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Or maybe you guys should start from this doorway and go to your spot.  And then go run.  We run to the spot.  That's exactly it.  Run to the spot at the same time.  We come here, and then.  Okay.  All right.  You go over there where you were.  Yes.  I go where I was. 
[01:38:30]  Absolutely.  We both, as we're both hailing.  Absolutely.  And.  Okay.  Yeah.  You go straight this way.  Yeah.  Make sure it's less than a bustle.  Okay.  Plenty of cabs.  Plenty of cabs.  Okay.  See that one right here?  You say go, Obie.  You say go.  Right there.  See him?  All right.  Hold on.  See that cab?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  When that light turns green.  And he's right up front.  Wait, man.  So, we've got a green light like a drag race.  Yeah.  It's like a drag race.  When that light turns green, game on.  Game on.  Game on.  Shwuggie versus the Nazi.  It's 3-3.  Who gets a cab?  Which is bad for Patrice, because that means three of them passed you by. 
[01:39:00]  For a Nazi.  A Nazi.  So, you.  A fucking Nazi.  Who gets passed up?  The people that were enslaved for so many years, or the people that killed six million Jews?  You've already lost, man.  Fuck.  You've already lost.  All right.  What about this cab turning?  You may have a point.  As soon as that light turns green.  Light turns green.  Game on.  Game on.  All right.  Okay.  So, you've got to put the mics down.  Yeah, mics down when the light turns green.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam, get this.  This is for the title right here.  Here it is.  Lights turning green any second now. 
[01:39:30]  And then we'll step out.  And give our little hail.  Game on!  Wait until he moves a little.  Wait until he moves.  Oh, shit.  He's turning.  Oh, he just grabbed somebody.  Oh, he did.  And a shwuggie at that, by the way.  All right.  Good.  I'm due.  All right.  Right behind.  Right behind that cab.  As soon as he takes off.  Can't be two cabs in a row picking up black people.  Oh, yeah.  That would be...  It's got to be a Nazi sympathizer driving one of these.  That's like the deal of getting three tins. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Go!  Go!  Game on!  Go!  Nazi versus the shwuggie.  The cab!  Oh, damn!  The Nazi list!  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for picking up a Nazi before an African-American.  Oh, Patron.  Did you realize that, sir?  I didn't know that.  You didn't know that?  You didn't see him with the gold chains and everything?  Oh, I didn't know.  Gold chain or silver chain.  Did you notice I'm wearing a German Nazi war helmet and I gave you the Nazi solution as a hail? 
[01:40:30]  Did you see me first?  Oh, and there he goes.  Did you see me first?  Ask him.  Ask him.  I need a motherfucking cab!  The Nazis win!  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that not right?  Patrice, that is not right.  Wow.  So, wait.  What happened?  What did the guy say?  This motherfucker...  He said he didn't see Patrice.  Patrice came bolting out. 
[01:41:00]  He didn't see a 500-pound nigga with jewelry on?  Right.  And a mic?  And a mic.  Didn't see it.  These guys have been influenced, by the way, because what I noticed every time, they're  stopping sort of in the middle, like they're confused, and then they inch up toward the  Nazi.  Just to get, like...  Just in case...  Just to get past you.  Right.  Just in case...  Unbelievable.  There is a problem in this city.  You mother...  Fuck...  I thought Danny Glover was full of shit.  The Third Reich gets a cab? 
[01:41:30]  The Third Reich gets a cab before a black guy.  Are you fucking serious?  This city is fucked up.  Are you fucking serious?  Best out of seven.  That was amazing.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Patrice.  I was sure I was going to win, man.  Good job.  I was sure you were going to win it.  That's ridiculous.  You pulled away.  You did...  I had a comeback.  The fucking Third Reich pulled away.  And it's good because with the seventh one, we did it completely even where we both came  out at the same time, gave our little salutes and hails, and he came right to me. 
[01:42:00]  Right to the Nazi.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the injustice.  That's fucking despicable shit.  Did you see that?  Did you fucking see that?  Despicable.  Holy shit.  Oh, that video's got to go up.  Yeah.  That video has to go up because that was some of the most despicable injustice you will  see.  Oh, my God.  Was that funny?  Nazi.  Every cabbie had a move. 
[01:42:30]  He tried to stop right in between the two, but then he kept inching forward toward Anthony.  Yeah.  Even the ones that were stopping for Patrice were like, eh, do I stop?  Do I roll forward to the Nazi?  I really thought he was stopping.  I thought you won.  Yeah.  I thought the last second he went past you.  I thought the first one was a fluke, and then after you got two more in a row, I thought,  okay, now it's just going to be a sweep.  Right.  But no.  No.  Just horrid cab drivers. 
[01:43:00]  And then we had a couple that didn't, that kind of stopped for me, and then he drove away,  and I looked in, and he looked like a U-boat commander, that guy, that pulled right up  to me and then pulled away when I shoved the mic in there.  That guy was a U-boat commander.  Das Boot.  We'll be right back with more of the best of O.P.  2006.  Just shut up and drive.  The Indianapolis 500.  The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte.  Two historic races. 
[01:43:30]  1,100 grueling miles.  And I'll do it all in one day.  This is Kurt Busch inviting you to follow my attempt at the double on Sunday, May 25th.

[01:48:00]  I'm loving it.  The eggnog drinking contest number three.  I forgot about the bad part of this.  What's the bad part?  The smell.  Dude, I had to put up a paper towel and then, like, spray it with Lysol, and I'm holding it up to my nose.  It's not a crime scene.  It smells like one.  Anthony, do you want to sip out of that pitcher that Magoo filled?  Shut up.  Magoo filled a pitcher, and I'm telling Anthony in the break that, wait, don't drink it yet.  Yeah, don't.  We got to do the big setup for this. 
[01:48:30]  Because if you swallowed some of that, it would be warm like his stomach, but I guarantee you there's a cool spot in there, like, where the stuff that just went down and his stomach didn't even warm.  You'd suck it down like an oyster.  A cool, like, clot of nog from his stomach would slide down your throat.  I think I'm having more fun.  You look like he's about to puke.  Dude, Joe, by the end of this, we have literally, like, 20, 25 people in this room.  By the end of this, there's going to be a lot of people puking.  But I'm having more fun watching Anthony get a little freaked out by this whole thing. 
[01:49:00]  I hate this.  Eric almost threw up.  Eric almost threw up when Sergeant Magoo was filling up the pitcher.  I almost puked, too, I admit.  Did you?  You know what it was?  It's the visual of filling up something that is supposed to be sanitary.  Let me give the big setup.  We got a guy getting close to puking here.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  These guys have been drinking double shots of eggnog every single minute.  When you puke, you're out.  We're down to six contestants.  I think we're going to get our...  Oh, double puke. 
[01:49:30]  Down goes full-blown AIDS.  Down goes full-blown AIDS.  Jesus Christ.  It's just as good coming back up.  Oh, no.  We just lost two competitors.  The cocky no shake.  Oh.  Take that finger down.  There it goes.  Dug out, Dug.  Dug out, Dug is out of the competition.  Oh, no.  Shane's going.  Shane's going.  Pulse alarm. 
[01:50:00]  Shane's...  Wow, Shane's...  Oh, there goes Shane.  Wow.  He got a running start with that one.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Out of the nose.  Look at Budaki.  He's like John Madden of Puking.  He's just doing the color comedy.  Oh, wow.  And the other guys have to do a shot.  All right.  Hold on.  We lost two, maybe three guys there.  We just lost three guys.  Three guys right there.  We lost Dug out.  Doug, who else did we lose? 
[01:50:30]  Shane and John.  Shane and John.  What shot was that?  That was the 30-second double shot of eggnog.  We got three guys left in the competition here.  Shane was a victim of the other two guys puke, and he said that those two guys puke and made  him puke.  He was facing the wall, like at the end of Blair Witch, and other people were puking.  Wait, there's only three guys left?  Three guys left.  We came back from break with six guys, and right away we lost three of them. 
[01:51:00]  Pat, the big...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh!  What happened there?  I missed it.  It came out of his nose.  It came out of his nose?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And Doug's not done yet.  Doug's vomiting more.  And Doug's now vomiting more.  I have to see him.  They had warm-ups really paid off this week, didn't they?  Shane was just wiping off his forehead.  That's how much it's sprayed out.  Wow.  He power-booted through his nose there, Joe.  You heard it.  It was like...  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  It was like a horse that just won the derby.  All right.  No surprise.  We're down to three competitors, and it's the three biggest guys in the competition.  Pat Ruminaki.  Who's it?  Generoso?  How am I doing proud?  You're in your...  Oh.  More pukey going from some of the guys that are out of the competition.  Oh.  Really?  He's coming out of his nose.  Coming out of his nose.  Oh, my God.  He goes out as much as his nose as it does his mouth.  And then what do we got over there?  Are you all right?  I'm good.  I'm all good.  I'm all good.  I'm all good.  Yeah, the 6'6", 460-pound dude is doing fine, too. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, Jerry doesn't even look nervous.  And so what is it?  Jerry Generoso and Pat Ruminaki left in the competition.  Hey, anybody want to make 20 bucks and just take a sip out of Sergeant Magoo's pitcher?  Yeah.  A nice warm sip.  Well, where is Sergeant Magoo?  He promised us a little thing here.  All right, you guys are cool, right?  All right, we're going to let the guys continue with the eggnog drinking contest.  That's 33, 34?  That's 35.  35.  See how fast this goes?  All right, they're up to 35 double shots of eggnog. 
[01:52:30]  Sergeant Magoo, the mic is yours there.  Yes, sir.  So what do you want to do today?  Well, I know what, I'm here to make Joe Rogan puke, maybe.  Joe, what do you think?  It's going to take a lot.  I've got a nice, fine, full pitcher here of eggnog, which I regurgitated.  Yeah.  So I figure maybe put in a little bowl of Froot Loops and we'll enjoy breakfast together.  I see the nice bowl of Froot Loops there on the table.  It needs just a little milk substance.  Oh, no.  A milky substance in there. 
[01:53:00]  Look how...  Oh, my God!  Oh, God damn it, no!  Holy Jesus, no, it's like, it's pouring like molasses.  No, Anthony, it's pouring like rice pudding.  It's rice pudding or pancake batter.  Thick pancake batter.  Oh, we might lose E-Rock!  E-Rock is losing it over there.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, did you see that pour?  Turn around, E-Rock.  Get on the mic.  Oh, God.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, he's eating Froot Loops out of his own vomit. 
[01:53:30]  E-Rock!  E-Rock, you all right?  I didn't know eggnog could clot.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  E-Rock's out puking.  Oh, an innocent bystander gets hit by a straight dog.  Let's make this perfectly clear.  Yes, E-Rock is not in the eggnog drinking contest.  He's one of our own.  He's just puking because he just saw Sergeant Magoo eating the Froot Loops with his own. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, it was the Hulk's preparation.  Anybody in the competition.  E-Rock is so pale right now, and his eyes are running with water.  E-Rock, look at how thick that is.  Magoo, do that again.  E-Rock, you got to look.  Oh, look, look, look.  Watch, watch, watch.  It's like snot.  Here goes E-Rock.  I almost puked.  Did you?  I had to walk away.  I had to walk away. 
[01:54:30]  I almost puked.  Poor E-Rock.  If I hadn't.  Oh, no.  Oh, we lost Generoso.  Generoso.  We just lost Generoso for whack bags out of town.  Sergeant Magoo is taking everybody out of the competition.  Oh, Magoo is carpet bombing.  Magoo's like a suicide bomber.  He really is.  Poor E-Rock.  Look at that.  Oh, look.  They're all stuck together.  It's like oyster crackers.  Magoo, why don't you top off the game? 
[01:55:00]  Fruit Loops with a little more of what you got in the picture there.  How does it take?  How does E-Rock again?  Eric is in the garbage.  E-Rock is puking off a storm.  His stupid headphones are still on.  God, that is hilarious.  Take us to break, stupid.  Oh, my God.  That is hilarious.  E-Rock.  Are you all right, E-Rock?  Look, he's going to top off.  E-Rock, watch him pour it.  Look, watch him pour it.  Eric, watch him pour it.  Just watch him pour it.  Look.  Look how thick.  Oh, my God. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's in the garbage.  What children?  E-Rock is puking.  He's all the way in the garbage can.  I almost lost.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Look at it hanging off the spoon.  Oh, God.  It's like snot.  Oh, my God.  Sergeant McGoo continues to eat the Froot Loops with his own eggnog puke mixture that he poured  from a pitcher.  Oh, adding more sugar. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, wow.  A guy like that on Fear Factor could have cleaned up, man.  Wow.  You can eat your own puke.  What's going to stop you?  Oh, look at Eric.  He's got snot.  Eric's a mess.  He really is, Jimmy.  Poor young hawk.  McGoo, hold that under his face a little bit.  Give him something.  What happened to I-Rock?  I threw up my nose.  You threw up your nose?  Out of his nose.  Out of his nose.  Do you want to eat it?  No.  E-Rock is a mess.  This is the most disgusting eggnog drinking contest we've ever had. 
[01:56:30]  We might not set a record.  We're down only two guys at this point.  Oh, God.  Look at the strings in it.  Oh, the strings that are connected.  Oh, no.  Oh.  E-Rock, look at it.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Every time Sergeant McGoo pours a little more into his Froot Loops, E-Rock loses it.  Where is that stupid Bob Kelly?  Oh, what I mean.  Jesus.  I invite him, but he'd be puking like crazy.  Poor guys in Washington.  We invite him, but he's got it.  All right.  We've got to get somebody else to take one sip out of McGoo's picture. 
[01:57:00]  Someone has to do it.  Oh, Jesus.  E-Rock's got a stomach like Karen Carpenter.  All right, let's get back to the competition, Ant.  We've got Pat from Menachie, and what's his name, Jerry?  I can't really see his name tag.  Jerry, right?  Shot.  We've got two guys left in the eggnog drinking contest.  Of course, Pat from Menachie, who comes into this competition as the favorite.  And very con record holder at 71 double shots that he did last year.  Jerry, how are you holding out? 
[01:57:30]  I'm doing perfect.  Doing perfect.  Pat, how about you?  I'm doing right in front of them eating.  Oh, I'm just wonderful.  You're wonderful.  Pat, any ill effect at all?  I have some of that when you're done.  You're not going to throw Pat.  Yeah, Pat's not phased.  Sergeant McGoo's trying to eat the Fruit Loop puke mixture right in front of Pat.  Pat has no problem with it.  God, that is so heinous.  By the way, Joe, Pat from Menachie, a diabetic.  He has nine toes.  He has nine toes.  And he's taking in all this sugar today.  He's a diabetic, and he's taking in all that sugar.  He does get rid of it at the end of the contest. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, it'll be gone soon enough.  And let me tell you, hearing him let go of all this eggnog, it's like putting on Sergeant  Peppers for the first time.  It's magic to your ears what you will hear.  It's why I'm here today.  I listened to it for a year.  It was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Pat puking is the showstopper.  It really is.  Well, I've heard it.  I've heard it on the radio, but I think seeing it.  It's like the Hollywood sound effect. 
[01:58:30]  It's so perfect.  Yeah.  We got guys in there who couldn't get in there.  A lot of guys drove from a long distance and couldn't get in here because it was too  much of a mess.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's going to puke.  No.  Can we get one of those guys in here?  Like, I want to chip in some money and get somebody.  Yeah.  I want somebody.  Hey, we got money.  Don't do it.  Who are you?  He's the intern guy.  This intern will eat Magoo's puke.  How much can we give him?  Oh, my God.  Well, we're not going to be communists.  All right.  I'm in for 20.  I chip in 100. 
[01:59:00]  Jimmy's got a bid going.  Wait, we got someone else that wants to do it over there.  They're getting more people.  I smell puke if people are walking by.  I threw 100, so.  Yeah, it's really disgusting, the smell in here.  Yeah, it's gross.  Jimmy, the competition should be they got to try to keep it down.  If they don't keep it down, we go to the next guy and the money goes up.  Okay.  That's what I say we do.  That's what I say we do.  Maybe I should take back 50, you know, now that I'm thinking of my bravado.  No, thanks.  It's all good.  You know, it's all fun and games.  Jimmy, throw us down 100.  Everybody comes over.  Right, right.  I know.  All right.  Yeah.  Where are we at? 
[01:59:30]  How many double shots of eggnog are we up to?  That'll be 42.  All right.  Anthony, they're doing their 40-second double shot of eggnog on their way, hopefully, to  a new record.  Yes, Sarge.  I see it.  Believe me.  He's holding up the pitcher like, look, puke.  Yeah, I know.  Magoo is a good boy.  He is a good boy.  He's a good boy.  He has really added a whole new element to this.  Yeah.  He took out like three guys because...  Yeah, that worked for the show.  Yeah, they were looking at it as they're trying to drink the eggnog.  They probably could have gotten a few more shots. 
[02:00:00]  I'm not saying they would have won or not, but Magoo definitely cramped their style.  I want to...  I'm sorry, did Steve see that?  What?  Steve didn't see that.  Steve, you got to see the viscous puke in the pitcher.  You're a tough guy.  Pour on the Froot Loops and then watch Sergeant Magoo eat it.  All right, watch this.  Here's our own Steve.  Pour a little on top, Magoo.  Steve, watch.  I can't see it.  Tattoo's definitely a tough man.  Yeah.  When he pours this...  Look how this mess...  It comes out like rice pudding. 
[02:00:30]  He's pouring it onto another bowl of fruit.  It's all curdled and sour.  Hawk?  It's the hanger.  Oh, the hanger.  Yeah, there's a hanger on the end of it.  I love it.  I would use the word congealed.  Congealed?  And now he takes his little spoon and his Froot Loops.  I spend a lot of time throwing up after that surgery I had, and this is awful.  And now look, like nothing, he mixes it up.  All right, he has no problem eating this.  Here he goes.  He's got a spoonful, and there goes Steve. 
[02:01:00]  I don't think E-Rock has any more puke in him.  He's dropping it.  He's playful.  Magoo is playful.  It's falling on his shirt.  Yeah.  He's like a little boy enjoying it.  It doesn't look as nasty as I thought it would, to be honest.  No?  No, it really doesn't.  Hey, by the way, I've gotten word from one of our pals, Wink Wink, that sits to my left  here, that Kenny cannot handle this.  No, he can't.  Where is Kenny?  We need him for security.  Get Kenny in here.  Kenny, why isn't our security guy in here?  Get Kenny in here. 
[02:01:30]  We don't know half these guys in here.  Look how many people we have.  I want to ask Kenny a question.  All right, Bill Burr, yes.  Can he be in the room?  Tell him to bring his food in.  He needs to come in here.  I just want to ask him a question.  Yeah.  Yes, Bill.  He actually requested that I stay in here, and he...  Really?  No.  No.  Kenny has to come in here.  Here comes Kenny.  20 years on the force.  The smell is really thick in this room, huh?  Yeah.  Kenny.  Between the...  We need you here.  I saw...  We feel threatened.  All right.  Hey, wait.  Let's get to Kenny.  Kenny's over here.  Come on to Kenny.  You guys don't realize how bad this room smells compared to the rest of the building. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I can't even tell.  I swear.  I'm not smelling anything yet.  It's awful.  I smell it.  I just finished eating my breakfast, too.  Can you just take a look at this, Kenny?  Why don't you watch the show?  Watch Magoo.  This is Sergeant Magoo.  Yeah, get Kenny and Mike.  Magoo.  Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  That is a pitcher.  That is a pitcher full of vomit.  No, get Kenny over there.  You know who's worse than me?  Roland is complaining in the other room.  Get Roland in here.  Get Roland in here.  He's right here.  He threw him to the dog.  What a tattletale. 
[02:02:30]  Get Roland.  Kenny, where are you going?  You can't leave.  No, Kenny.  Stay in here, there.  You don't even have to torture him.  He's just immediately told where the platoon was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're ratting him out.  Two clicks to the mic.  I don't like it, but Roland doesn't like it either.  What a snitch.  Roland, you having a tough time?  Get on a mic.  Just find any mic.  Oh, this is going to be pricey.  Yeah, I just had breakfast, too, and I was like, oh.  Really?  Did you see Magoo pour it?  No.  Look.  All right.  Watch Magoo.  All right.  Get Roland a mic there, Roland.  Explain to Roland what that is. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, get Roland a mic.  He's in front of Sergeant Magoo now.  Magoo's been out of the contest.  A lot of the people puke into the buckets, but Magoo chose to puke into that beer pitcher,  which he is now pouring on Froot Loops.  Watch how it pours.  That was eggnog moments ago.  It is now a bile-y mess.  Oh, he's drinking, uh, Roland's drinking Coke.  Coke trying to...  Oh, look at that hanger.  Now it's, like, pouring, like, yogurt.  It's not even rice pudding anymore.  Oh, God, it's hardening.  It's really starting to congeal. 
[02:03:30]  And now he will...  Watch this.  Watch this, Roland.  He mixes up the Froot Loops.  Yeah.  Come on, Roland.  Get a nice eyeful.  Come on, Roland.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  That's for the competition.  No!  All right, let me explain.  Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy that we're going to hire as an intern, he's out  of the competition, obviously.  Sergeant Magoo has been eating his own Froot Loops puke combination.  Now, Sergeant Magoo gave the concoction to Connecticut School of Broadcasting guy, so 
[02:04:00]  now he's eating Sergeant Magoo's puke on Froot Loops.  Oh, my God.  Eric's about to go again.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  Shh, shh, shh.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, there goes E-Rock.  E-Rock is puking again.  He certainly is.  And he has nothing to do with this competition.  We're finding the weak stomachs among us.  Look at Bill Burr, not looking so good.  Bill, you all right?  I'm all right, I'm all right.  Bill, did you see that?  Did you watch that, Bill?  What got you?  The fact that he's eating someone else's puke? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was too much.  Hey, where's Club Soda Kenny?  He's right there.  Kenny's here.  Hey, wait a minute.  Hey, would somebody take, and that picture is so awful, would somebody take a sip out of  it, like without the Froot Loops?  Just a sip.  Just a nice, thick, yogurty sip.  Oh!  Eric's down.  E-Rock's down.  E-Rock's down again.  Wait, we've got to explain, because it's just noise for people out there.  The intern took a big, mouthful sip out of Magoo's pitcher of thick, viscous-y vomit. 
[02:05:00]  He took a Viking swig.  Pat Duffy.  A Viking swig.  And it spilt over his cheeks and chin, ran down his shirt, and splattered on the floor.  That was a victory battle.  He just conquered this town and celebrated with Magoo.  The government needs to follow that dude around.  Dude, this kid started as a listener, a competitor.  Now he's an intern.  By the end of the show, you're going to be like a co-host of this show.  And E-Rock, of course, puked again when that happened. 
[02:05:30]  You get E-Rock's job, by the way.  He's got someone else's puke from his mouth on his own shoes.  Dude, did we explain that he just poured the whole pitcher?  He tipped the pitcher into his mouth, and half it went into his mouth, which he swallowed.  Half it went onto his chin and his beard, after he ate Magoo's puke with Froot Loops on it.  My dad's listening.  My dad's listening.  You raised a tough son of a bitch, sir.  Hey, keep it off the rug.  Keep it off the rug.  You should be proud.  You should be proud.  You should be a Marine. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, it got right on the edge of the tarp.  All right, let's get back to the competition.  It's Pat from Manaki and Jerry.  Where are you going, Hawk?  We only got two guys left in the eggnog drinking contest.  How many shots are we up to?  You have to go back to the days of Attila the Hun to find that kind of disgusting Roman puke rooms.  Just look at E-Rock's face.  Look how he's sad and red, yet pale.  My throat is killing me.  His throat hurts.  It's coming out his nose, and his eyes are all watery and teary. 
[02:06:30]  You look like a basset hound.  You look like Hulk Hogan just walked away from you.  Hey, I've got to ask Joe Rogan.  Are you impressed?  Yeah.  I mean, you've seen it all on Fear Factor.  Are you impressed with this, or what?  I'm very impressed with the drinking of the puke.  Yeah.  That's unprecedented.  I've never seen anything like that.  I bow down.  I bow down to Pat Duffy.  All right, right on.  Pat Duffy.  Holy mother of Jesus.  Yeah, well...  And he didn't puke after he did it.  No.  Huh?  Can someone else do that for the money? 
[02:07:00]  Well, we've got another kid.  You guys want to do the same thing?  What'd you say?  What'd you say?  This guy's saying he can top what he did?  No, he said he can't top that.  Oh, you can't top that.  All right.  How about the guy with the beard, the Nirvana shirt?  We recognize him.  Can you top that?  Do you think you could drink that?  The beard is going to be a nice touch.  The beard?  Yeah.  It drooling down the beard.  It really looks like a fake beard, doesn't it?  Do you think you could top drinking...  Oh, he's stepping in the other guy's puke.  He's in the puke now.  He's stepping in it.  Do you think you could top drinking that puke out of that beer pitcher? 
[02:07:30]  Can I top it?  If you gargle it.  I have no idea.  Can you do it?  Who can gargle?  You know what we should do?  We should fill up two cups and see who could drink an entire cup.  One or the other.  A chugging contest?  Yeah.  You're out?  No, I got it.  I'm in.  Oh, my God.  He's an animal, Joe.  He's an animal.  He's already done it.  You're a rookie.  I think we can get somebody to pee in a cup and drink out of it.  I think we can get somebody to drink somebody else's pee.  I could see that happening. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, I don't think that'll go through.  Nah, nah.  I don't think that'll make it.  Yeah, nah, nah, nah.  What's happening with the air competition in this room?  Yeah, well, speaking of the air in this room.  I think pee is a step down from...  Enough about the pee!  Stop!  None of it's making it.  None of it's making the radio.  Let's just say no fluid is as vile as vomit.  I don't think vomit's the worst you can get.  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Okay.  There was a lot of dumping that had to be done there.  Okay, we're back to the competition.  We're at to what?  51.  51.  51.  Now I'm seeing Jerry. 
[02:08:30]  Jerry and Pat from Munaki.  Jerry's taking some deep breaths.  Yeah, I'm getting a little shaky.  You get a little shaky.  Pat from Munaki, how are you holding up?  I'm fine.  Pat is fine.  Unshakable.  Pat is amazing.  An amazing athlete, I like to call him.  High-level athlete.  Yes.  Yeah.  Next year, we've got to do this.  Jerry's sweating.  We've got to do this in front of an audience, man.  You're looking a little pale, and I'm seeing like this almost spasmatic, like you're ready  to...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Sergeant Magoo has poured out the big cups of puke. 
[02:09:00]  Magoo is a good pourer.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I almost gagged.  It's like this.  Sweaty.  You came very close.  It's like this seaweed.  Look at Eric.  He won't look up.  It looks like curdled vanilla pudding.  Good call.  Curdled vanilla pudding.  Yeah.  All right.  Here it is.  Two equal cups full of eggnog, Bobbitt.  Jerry, don't look at this, bro.  Brother, don't look at this.  I want you in this competition a little longer.  Holy Jesus.  All right.  We've got the two guys still...  Is this a clean cup?  Hold on.  Here's the deal.  We've got the two guys still in the eggnog drinking contest officially. 
[02:09:30]  We've got a small little...  Clean cup.  We've got three rings happening here.  It's like a circus.  We've got these two guys on the side.  They're going to drink a cup of eggnog, right?  Mm-hmm.  First one.  Eggnog puke.  Eggnog puke.  What's the deal?  The guy who finished first wins the money?  Yeah.  Jimmy, it's your thing.  I think so, yeah.  I don't care.  Whoever wants it now.  Whoever finishes it first?  Wait.  Whoever finishes first?  No, no, no.  Because there might be more puke to be drunk.  I mean, we don't want anybody rushing.  Just enjoy it.  So what's the...  Who wins? 
[02:10:00]  Who wins?  I don't know.  We need some rules here.  We need some rules.  How about nobody?  Yeah, I don't think there's money.  Whoever turns this show off wins.  I think they ought to have a chug contest.  Whoever can chug it and hold it wins.  If they both do it, they've got to do another cup.  Oh, my God.  This is insane.  Huh?  Another eggnog puke challenge.  I say gargle.  I want to hear somebody...  Jerry's rumbling.  Jerry.  I'll gargle it.  What's your name, by the way, Nirvana guy? 
[02:10:30]  Drew.  Drew, what's up?  He looks like he's in his spin doctor's.  Someone else's vomit.  That was a long time listening to my puke.  That was your chance.  This is really tough.  I've never had this tough a time.  Nope.  Stan's unflappable, too.  Nothing bothers Stan.  He's just standing there, tenting his pants.  He doesn't care.  I've been fine with everything so far.  So far.  Paul R. Nelson shirt on.  Show off.  Stan is unflappably psychotic.  So I say someone's got to gargle with that puke.  Why not?  I mean, it'd be cute.  Drew?  Jesus, Drew. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, whoa.  He just gargled Sergeant Magoo's puke.  All right.  That got a little too close.  Did they make a mouthwash for that?  Yes, they did.  It's called a bullet.  By the way, HDNet is filming this whole thing.  Okay.  That got a little too close.  That splatter got a little too close.  A little speck got on my chair.  This must be eliminated immediately, or I will leave the program. 
[02:11:30]  Drew?  It tastes like vomit.  What does it taste like?  What does it taste like, Drew?  It tastes like eggnog.  Warm eggnog.  Warm eggnog.  But there's clumps in it.  Dude, there's clumps.  It was warmed up in a man's stomach.  All right.  We got the intern with you.  Pat Duffy?  Yep.  Hold on.  Jerry's raising his hand over there.  Jerry?  What's the matter, Jerry?  I thought it was for a second.  What?  I thought it was for a second.  All right.  What shot are we up to?  We're getting close.  Dan, how many shots are we up to?  54.  All right.  The guys that are still in the competition, it's only two. 
[02:12:00]  Pat from Minaki and Jerry.  They're about to do their 54th double shot.  Oh, they're going to do 55 right now.  All right.  Their 55th double shot of eggnog.  I think last year, Pat, did 71.  Yeah.  We're getting close to the record now.  Pat, how many more do you think you can do?  A few.  Uh-oh.  Oh, there goes Jerry.  Just put his down.  Pat's eating less because he loses weight for his girl, so Pat's not in quite...  He's not in shape.  Not in this kind of shape.  He's becoming in better everyday shape. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Settle down, Pat.  Find yourself a nice girl and settle down.  Yeah, where's your girl there, Pat?  You don't know, do you?  Uh-oh.  I'm going to puke.  Oh, no.  Everyone, this is the big guy, Jerry.  Here comes the bison.  Shh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's like he's sneezing through his mouth.  I can't get it done. 
[02:13:00]  It doesn't want to come out.  Did he technically puke?  Yep.  Yeah, we got a winner, actually.  Somebody, uh...  What a different sound.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  All right, here it comes now.  Does this mean I won? 
[02:13:30]  Magoo's holding the thing under.  Hold the pitch under, Magoo.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Puke into the pitcher, sir.  Jerry is still over the barrel.  Not much has come out, considering how much he's got in.  It's a lot of effort.  It felt like a golf match.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh.  He's pukin into the other thing of puke.  He's heading to Sergeant Magoo's pitcher. 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  Wow.  This is so heinous.  This is so bad.  Oh, man.  You know what's funny?  The pitcher was so heinous that him puking didn't even faze me.  I don't know.  His puke is different.  Yeah.  There's something about it.  It looks like white cheddar cheese puffs.  Yeah.  It's thicker.  It's a cottage cheesy thing.  Yeah, it's had time to really solidify in his stomach.  Yeah, the water has gone through different pipes.  Yeah.  Left the solid.  Body chemicals have been added. 
[02:14:30]  Look at this.  Oh, God.  I like how he's enticing him with it.  Yeah.  The best part about this is Pat isn't even remotely fazed.  No.  How are you feeling, Pat?  Jerry.  I'm feeling pretty damn good.  Jerry?  All right, here's the deal.  Jerry is the runner-up in the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat from Menaki gets his title back.  And not only that, he just finished the shot.  He never had to.  Right.  He didn't have to finish it, but he just chugged down. 
[02:15:00]  And he's refilling his cup.  Look at him go.  Hey, Pat, you going to go for the record or no?  Uh, I already won.  Did I mention I was diabetic?  Pat, do you have a grand finale in you?  Hmm, funny you say grand.  Wow.  Yeah, where's the money coming from?  Do we have to promote anybody or is it just cold, hard cash? 
[02:15:30]  Ooh.  From just the radio station?  Free FM here in New York?  Going on a real good date with Tanya.  Huh?  With that.  You're going to take Tanya on a date?  Yeah.  Buy us something nice?  Drive for a master post somewhere.  Hey, uh, let's go to the phones.  Pat, what are you going to do?  You want to go for the record or no?  Sure, what the hell?  All right, Pat's going to go for the record.  All right.  Ah, let's say hi to Pete in the Bronx.  Pete, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  What's going on?  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I thought my window was open and I threw up all over the goddamn car. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, this is great, man.  All right, thanks.  It's one of those tough shows.  Larry on Long Island.  It really is tough.  Larry.  What's going on?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  I'm driving my truck on Sunrise Highway and I look to my left and I see this chick and  she's listening to the show.  She has to be.  Looks like she's gagging and making all these messed up faces.  I look to my right and I can see this dude in a truck and I know he's listening and he's  laughing his ass off. 
[02:16:30]  Classic radio.  Unbelievable.  I'm loving it.  It's been unbelievable today.  Let's go to Boston.  Zach, what's up?  Zach.  I love Zach.  Let's go to Brandon in Cleveland.  Brandon.  I was fine up until Jimmy started explaining it.  The Viking swig.  I had to burp and I had to run to the kitchen listening to you guys on direct TV.  And I say the money has to go.  I say that would the young intern gargle with the other man's vomit? 
[02:17:00]  I say you get the money.  Absolutely.  This kid, nothing fazes him.  Nah, he's a tough competitor.  Just be careful you don't throw up on the walk.  The only way to top this would be if someone put their head over the bucket with an open  mouth and let Pat Ramunaki throw up in their mouth.  Joey!  That's why Joe Rogan is here.  That's the next level, people.  Let's not make this happen next year.  Let's make it happen this year.  What do you say?  Well, Pat's going to...  See that?  That's all those years from all those great pitch meetings.  That's all the experience.  That's right.  It was a wonderful episode.  Human water fountain. 
[02:17:30]  Well, Pat's going to have to get rid of what he's got in his belly because he's a diabetic.  So, how many shots is Pat up to?  Sixty.  Sixty?  If we can get someone to just lean back and put the head over the bucket with an open  mouth...  Who's going to lean back?  Can I catch it with this cup and treat it?  No, no, no, no.  It's open mouth.  Well, we have to go to...  Eric can hold you up.  Wow, we've got to take a break.  We want to take a break now.  Pat, you think you can do that?  Open mouth?  You've got good aim.  Pat, can you hold out for five minutes before you do?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Sure. 
[02:18:00]  How many minutes do you have to do?  This is going to be the most disgusting thing ever.  Like he's ever done this before.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Pat, how close are you to puking?  I'm pretty good right now.  You can hold out for a few minutes?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Pat's a pro.  All right, here's the deal.  Pat's going to go for the record.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll continue with the O.P. and Anthony show.  I guess when we get back, it's the showstopper that Joe came up with.  Pat's going to have to get rid of this.  He won the eggnog drinking contest, and he's going to get rid of it as the new intern dude  is over the bucket, right? 
[02:18:30]  Pat Duffy.  Other Pat.  Pat Duffy.  All right.  We're back for the grand finale of the eggnog drinking contest.  Wow.  If you're just joining in, Pat Fumunaki has won the eggnog drinking contest, getting his  title back.  He's won two out of the three competitions.  He's going for the record, which stands at 71 double shots of eggnog that he set last year.  And what else is going on, Anthony?  We've got the new intern.  Yeah, the new intern. 
[02:19:00]  Pat.  Pat.  What's his last name?  Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Pat Duffy.  Yeah.  Pat Duffy.  Soon to be legend.  And yeah, he is soon to be a legend in this competition because he has volunteered to let Pat  Fumunaki, who has had how many shots?  Uh, 67.  67 shots.  He is four shots away from tying the eggnog drinking contest record.  Earlier, Sergeant Magoo, as we know, puked into a beer pitcher, poured it into a bowl of 
[02:19:30]  Froot Loops and ate it, which is really disgusting.  And so did, yeah.  Pat.  Pat, our new intern.  He did that.  One step, one step.  Ate some of the Froot Loops.  But now he has volunteered, um, with a little bit of prodding, to letting...  If he wants a job as an intern on the show, he's going to do this.  Yeah.  To letting Pat Fumunaki unload his vomit into his mouth directly. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, because Pat has to get rid of this because he's a diabetic.  Yeah, he's a diabetic.  Now, he's going to kneel.  I would say you should get into position shortly where you kneel on the tarpaulin and lean  the head back over the garbage can because you don't want to be balanced.  You don't want to fall back and break your neck.  Do we have a table?  I think...  What about that little stool there?  A good stool.  Good point.  Like in Max Hardcore?  Can he sit on that?  Let's get the stool.  Is that tall enough?  Yep.  Can he lean his throat back?  Hey, I got to use that.  Is that stool good?  Put the stool against there.  See if he could sit on that and lean his head back like he's at the dentist. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, because he can't be the back of the head.  He's got...  Yeah.  That could be perfect size.  Oh, my God.  Okay, that works perfectly.  Like a hair salon.  Yeah.  Yeah, like he's having his hair shampooed.  There you go.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam.  Sam.  Did you shoot from that angle?  Yeah, shoot from another angle because if we don't get a view of this, I'm going to  be pissed.  This is like watching Haley's Comet.  Oh, you missed it.  You know, you're not going to see this again.  Sam, get in position.  Yeah.  HD net, get in position.  Pat from Minaki, how many shots have you done?  Oh, God.  This is actually also like Flashdance. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  That scene where he pulls the little handle and the water goes all over him, but it certainly  won't be water.  Yeah, you get one later.  All right.  Wait, where are we at?  Where's Pat at?  Pat 68.  You really think this is...  You're really going to be able to do this one?  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah, I'll do it.  You're going to let a dude throw up in your mouth.  Yeah.  Sam, how's that camera battery?  Good?  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah, we got like a three-camera shoot going on.  By the way, this is called The Baby Bird, right?  Than came up with the name?  Yeah, Than came up with the name, The Baby Bird. 
[02:21:30]  The Baby Bird.  Rogan, of course, that sick bastard, came up with the idea.  Yeah.  And he's in position.  For the first time...  Pat's in position.  ...in radio history, you're about to listen to The Baby Bird.  The Baby Bird.  How about the first time in human history?  Which is...  Now, I think some fraternity did this somewhere.  That's true.  We're making German pornography.  Right.  This is...  No, I think he was right the other way.  He's too high in the air now.  Yeah, don't be all silly.  It's all right, because some's going to get on the tarp. 
[02:22:00]  We have a tarp.  We have a tarp.  It's fine.  Pat, how many shots are you up to?  69.  69.  Pat is very close to the eggnog drinking contest record.  Okay, I'm feeling it, though.  You're feeling it?  Yeah.  I'm feeling that pressure.  Feeling a little nausea?  All right.  We got the new intern, Pat, in position.  Pat Duffy.  This is going to be incredible.  And Danny.  Could you mic him from the other side?  Without getting Sam's way to...  We got to film it properly.  Yeah.  We got to film it properly.  Sam, you miss this, you die. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  This is very important.  Don't go for art.  Go for documentary.  Exactly.  HD.  You should get over there, too, just in case.  I think I'm close enough.  You're going to be all right?  Yeah, this guy...  The cameraman's not into the whole puke thing, but he's filming it for HD now.  You know, sometimes you got to...  It's like a war correspondent.  I understand.  You don't want to see it, but you're there, and you have to document what happened.  All right.  A lot of things going on.  Pat, what shot you got in your hand now?  This is to tie the record right here, guys. 
[02:23:00]  How you doing?  He's taking his time.  It's rough, huh, Pat?  He's calling this one over.  Pat, do it for love.  He's going to tell me when to go.  Oh, Pat's ready.  All right.  This ties the Eggnog Drinking Contest record.  Pat has officially tied it.  He is one shot away from setting a brand new record here.  Like a true champion, he's only in competition with himself.  Yeah, only with himself.  He could have stopped.  He won the competition.  He's feeling the pressure.  You could see it on his face.  He's not as confident as he was at the beginning of this. 
[02:23:30]  No.  He is just going for the record, though, so he can pace himself.  He doesn't have to worry about losing.  And the loneliness of the champion left there standing.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Also, his belly is really bloated.  Yeah, it is really pushed out.  Because you've lost weight, and you've got a massive belly today.  You look like a no-filter pole.  Now, I would suggest to Pat over here, the new intern, our new favorite intern, Pat,  that don't move.  It's just going to make it worse.  Close your eyes. 
[02:24:00]  Your instinct is probably going to be to sit up quickly and get out of the way,  but that'll just make it worse.  Just shut your eyes.  Let it happen.  Now, wait, wait.  Where's Pat Fumunaki going to stand?  Because you've got a whole bunch of guys to stand.  Yeah, Pat, what's your position going to be?  Right there.  Give him, like, a little hair rinse.  Do a dry run.  You've got to get his mouth.  No, the mouth, Pat.  Well, the whole head.  The whole head.  But aim for his mouth.  The record.  The record.  The record.  Pat has just set a new record of 72. 
[02:24:30]  72.  Fantastic.  This kid could not be more relaxed.  He's, like, lucky.  I know.  His heart rate hasn't even gone up.  Pat, can we have, like, a dry run of what you're going to do?  Let's say you're ready to puke.  What are you going to do?  Brace yourself on the bucket, each hand, on the sides of the bucket.  And then right in his mouth.  In the mouth, Pat.  Don't worry about the bucket.  I mean, we've got the talk down.  It's called the baby bird.  It's not gay, Pat.  Pat.  You are the mommy bird coming back to feed the baby bird.  Feed your young. 
[02:25:00]  No baby's hungry.  Pat, just destroy it.  God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's going to destroy him.  Please say that before you do it.  Pat, just destroy his face, man.  We don't care about the mess.  We'll clean up afterwards.  Oh, no.  That's right.  It's Tom's tie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  73.  73.  Unbelievable.  73 double shots of eggnog from Pat Fuminaki.  It's the worst thing ever.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  This is really, really bad.  He's got that look on his face like those guys in the 80s that were about to fight Tyson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just that all inevitable loss.  Joe Rogan playing Carolines all weekend long.  With the amazing racist opening up.  Pat, how are you?  Uh, it's getting real close.  All right.  It's getting real close.  The suspense.  All the cameras out.  We've never had more people in the studio, by the way.  There's got to be about 30 people in here.  At least.  And what he's doing is very DiMaggio-esque. 
[02:26:00]  This is like the 56-game hitting streak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  73 shots.  This will never be broken.  Hey, someone is saying, please center the PalTalk camera.  We got it.  I got mine done.  All right.  No, no.  Mine's fine.  It's PalTalk 2.  All right.  That somebody's in the way of or something like that.  I guess it's the camera guy.  What shot is that?  The left.  74.  Oh, he's going for more.  He's going for 75.  Everyone's got to pretty much keep their position so the cameras and everybody can see. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, that's fine.  People are calling from all over America.  They've been puking all over the place.  75.  Just about every city in America.  And in Canada, thanks to XM.  He's just drinking now.  He's up to 75.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here it goes.  Oh, God.  The baby bird is going down.  The baby bird is happening.  The baby bird is happening.  I can't speak.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:27:00]  No.  No way.  No way.  No way did that happen.  No way did that just happen. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I almost wet myself.  I swear to you.  I'm laughing so hard.  We lost Jimmy.  He's laughing so hard he ran into the corner.  Yeah.  A thunderous round of applause. 
[02:28:00]  Down goes Pat.  Down goes Pat.  He's wearing puke blackface.  That was the greatest moment in radio history, period.  It's impossible to top that.  That's impossible.  Trust me on that.  How can you top that?  Trust me on that.  How can that be topped?  We are announcing our retirement right now because that is it.  How can that be topped?  Wow.  Joe.  That can't be topped.  That was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.  That was insane.  Can you believe you were watching that as it was happening? 
[02:28:30]  I cannot believe I saw that.  Holy.  Jimmy, what happened?  I was filming it on my camera for posterity.  It was like Zapruder.  And as I got a hit, the smell hit me.  I almost threw up.  I mean, the smell.  That kid is interned.  The best part when Pat, our new intern, turned his head sideways to get some of it off of his face.  And Pat puked right in his ear. 
[02:29:00]  What about when he opened his eyes and all of a sudden it was just these two clear dots in the middle of this pancake batter?  Listen.  He's going.  He keeps going.  All right, listen.  Oh, my God.  I'm watching it on Joe Rogan's camera phone.  Oh, my God.  I'm crying.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Look, look, look.  Hold on, Ant.  We've got to do this because everyone's asking what the hell happened.  All they heard was the reaction.  So, Pat from Minaki, what shot was that?  The 75th?  He did this 75th. 
[02:29:30]  You've got to get that.  Hold on.  Let's do this, Ant.  Oh, the cleanup.  He did his 75th double shot of eggnog because people aren't sure exactly what happened.  Okay?  He immediately lost it.  We had Pat Duffy leaning over the bucket.  And Pat just unloaded everything that was in his stomach.  I've never seen anyone puke more volume in my life all over Pat Duffy's head.  He's still cleaning off his head.  It's pouring out of his hair still, the puke.  He just shook his head like he got out of a pool, you know, when you have stuff in your ear. 
[02:30:00]  There was no way to describe it as it was going on because it was the reaction in the studio was just amazing.  Oh, my God.  I defy that clip to not make the number one downloaded clip on YouTube.  We're going for number one download on YouTube.  What the hell are you going to watch that's better than that?  That clip will be up on YouTube, what, within a day?  I'm sending that to my website.  It's going to be at JoeRogan.net in about 10 seconds.  That's got to be, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  That has to be online immediately.  It's going right now.  It's going right now.  Brilliant.  Oh, look, Joe is uploading it as we speak at.  Technology.  JoeRogan.net?  Yeah, JoeRogan.net.  It'll be up in my phone camera slot section.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I was watching it, and it was an out-of-body experience because I was like, I know what it's like now to watch a murder happen.  Dude, you're watching going, oh, my God, this isn't really happening.  All right, Anthony, because people are like, all we heard was you guys screaming. 
[02:31:00]  You've got to understand.  It was so unbelievable.  We stepped out of being radio hosts and just watched.  All right?  When I suggested it, I did not think he was going to take it out.  I'm telling you right now, and I have been doing radio for 12-plus years.  That is the greatest moment that we've seen in studio.  And we've seen it all.  And we've seen it all.  That he was leaning back, his head over the garbage pail, sitting on a stool like you would getting your hair shampooed at a salon.  Oh, God.  That's the exact stance he had.  Pat was on the other side where the sink would be, where the faucets would be, yeah. 
[02:31:30]  The mama bird side.  Yeah, the mama bird side.  Pat, the intern, mouth opened.  And then Pat from Unaki just let loose a virtual waterfall.  Have you ever seen anyone puke more volume?  No.  That was insane.  I can't even describe how much came out of him.  It's uploaded.  It's at JoeRogan.net now.  There's a little section in the upper left-hand corner that says latest camera phone shot.  It'll be a video. 
[02:32:00]  It'll be on Text America.  Good luck.  You can find it on JoeRogan.net.  Good luck.  You just crashed your site, I'm sure.  I don't care.  Wow.  I got it on my cell phone.  I don't care.  I can't believe I saw that.  Yeah, Steve, get that video up on Opium Ethics.  And it kept happening and happening.  It wasn't like it happened and then it was done.  Right.  It went on and on and on.  On and on.  Pat just, and the volume, yeah.  It was more each time until he was completely covered.  It looked like that.  The mama bird.  God.  Look at this disgusting, it stinks. 
[02:32:30]  Pat was standing there and he would just open his mouth and it shot out of him.  It almost looked like fake puke.  Like it was being done with a hose.  Like what she says, when she's open her mouth and puked, shot out.  And like Joe said, simple as this.  We just raised the bar.  I guarantee that is the greatest moment in radio history right there as far as just over-the-top stuff.  Oh my God.  I guarantee.  When you see this video on YouTube and opiumethy.com, you're not going to believe it.  I'm uploading a second video.  I got two videos. 
[02:33:00]  And he never puked himself.  Yeah, you didn't puke, right, Pat?  You are a trooper.  Pat Duffy, man.  Pat Duffy.  He's our new.  He's saving it for the walkover.  He's our new intern.  That dude is a savage.  Give him the money.  It's not much money, but give it to him.  That's his money.  Oh, yeah.  Here, Pat.  Now that's a way to apply for a goddamn job.  Absolutely.  Oh my God.  You're hired.  He deserves health insurance after that one.  Yeah, dental even.  What are your references?  He puts his head back and opens his mouth.  Wow.  A little thing called the baby bird. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  You ever hear of the baby bird?  Me.  Greatest moment in radio history?  Yeah.  Wow.  Does it smell over there, Steve?  Steve has puke on him.  Puke on the wires.  There's puke all over me.  It really is.  Is it smelling bad, Hawk?  Yes.  They're good.  People are calling it puke-cocky.  Hey, we're going to walk over to XM.  Yeah.  And we have some, the boys will be drinking some eggnog on the way.  Yeah.  This young go-getter, Pat Duffy.  Yeah.  Hopefully we won't throw up on the walkover because we'd hate to see that on 57th Street 
[02:34:00]  because that would look really awful.  Yeah.  We'll be filming.  Well, I'm now looking at the text that was coming out of Pal Talk because the people watching  it on the cameras.  And I've never seen so many no's being written ever.  People are just disgusted.  Other people just throwing in random letters, like they just slammed their keyboard and  hit send.  You know, they were stunned.  Dude, for the first time, I think the reaction said it all.  I mean, we had over 30, maybe 40 people in studio just losing their minds. 
[02:34:30]  Jimmy, like, I didn't even, I didn't even know where you went.  I stood on the couch and was filming with my own camera.  I fell on the floor.  I was laughing so freaking hard.  I was crying.  I thought I was going to wet myself.  No one else was puking.  They were just, I got right next to it to get it on my camera phone.  I didn't even throw up.  I was so transfixed by the moment.  I couldn't believe it was actually happening.  It was like an alien abduction.  You are a trooper, man.  And then a lot of applause was incredible.  Yeah.  It's called the baby bird.  We'll be right back with more of the best of O'Connor.

Dude, that is a funny fucking story, man.  That is a really funny fucking story.  Listen to what happened to Patrice.  Since the last time we saw him.  Yeah, it was like Christmas time.  I had driven home, went to go to Boston for a second. 
[02:39:30]  So I'm driving back.  I'm driving back through Connecticut.  You know you drive and you get that scared, tired, like that tired that you just, you go,  oh my God, I'm getting ready to die.  Yeah.  Tired.  You don't have any more confidence in yourself that you can keep yourself awake.  You're like, oh damn.  It's cold, so all the windows are down.  Yeah.  Fucking young Jeezy.  Yeah, I'm up, motherfuckers.  Blasting, punching your leg. 
[02:40:00]  And just that type of, tired, where I went to sleep a couple of times.  So I said, I got to find some, I was getting ready to pull over to the side.  So you start having the logic in your head where you're like, I could close my eyes for  five seconds.  Jeez, now when you're driving.  No.  You've never done that?  No.  I've sat there, petrified, just like Patrice is talking.  I think I can give it, just, all right, just two seconds.  I sit there with your eyes open going, motherfucker, you've got to stay awake.  You've never negotiated with yourself?  No, no, I have, but it said, I think I can do a couple seconds here? 
[02:40:30]  No.  Because you're so tired that your logic is starting to go?  No.  No, my logic goes in a different way, where you're driving, your eyes are open, you're  watching the road and you're going, motherfucker, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake,  stay awake, stay awake, stay awake, and then, like, oh, trees, road, sky, and you're just  out, and then, what the fuck, I was just telling you to stay awake, asshole.  Like, at first, you're driving and your hand is at the bottom, you know, where your hand 
[02:41:00]  is pointed up, and you're controlling the bottom of the wheel, then when you get those  scares, you put your left hand out the window, hang out the window, drive with your hand  on the top, that, okay, I'm up now.  Oh, no.  I do.  I'm that kind of horrified tired, so I got to stop.  I do the Harvey Keitel fucking Reservoir Dogs chant to myself, you got to stay awake,  come on, I smack myself in the face, stay awake, stay awake, you're going to fucking 
[02:41:30]  stay awake.  I don't know how, like, the truck drivers, they must know tricks to do.  Yeah, they know tricks, all right, it comes in a bottle, or it comes in fucking a piece  of tinfoil, or whatever the fuck, called crystal methadrine.  I really have a corny mouth, because I'm thinking, boy, those guys, man, how do they  do it?  Cocaine!  Coke, crystal meth, whatever keeps you fucking going.  Whatever gets the load there on time.  Oh, my God.  From wrapping up a family of five.  I'm sitting there thinking they must have, oh, they channel Yum Curry, the magical truck 
[02:42:00]  god that gives them energy and strength, you know?  Oh, God, the truck god, the truck god.  There's a truck god, you snort it through a straw, you smoke it, whatever.  Oh, my God.  So, I start driving and shit, and I go, I see a McDonald's in the distant, you know, oh,  shit, McDonald's fucking rest stop.  Yeah.  I just do 95 till I get there.  Pull in there, park, I go, thank God, I lean my seat back. 
[02:42:30]  Now, you know, I drive.  What time is this about?  About three in the morning.  Oh, way to go, Mr. Jordan.  Wow.  Way to go, Mr. Jordan.  I just always leave late.  I just always just go there and come back, like, leave at 12.  Yeah.  No traffic.  I kind of like the no traffic angle.  Yeah, no traffic.  When you're falling asleep.  Go down to Merritt or 95 from time to time.  Yeah.  So, I park there, I put my seat back.  Now, I drive a Suburban, and it's nigg it up big time.  Like, you know, I got 22s just so don't fuck because I drive in New York. 
[02:43:00]  I would get 24s.  Yeah.  But, you know, the potholes fuck your shit up.  So, I got tent that's like as black as anything, you know, and the whole nine.  So, you know, I put my seat back.  Whew.  Thanking God.  Put my skylight up.  I look in the sky and shit.  Just fall asleep.  I lean back.  You're probably out in like two seconds.  About two seconds.  Yeah.  But, for some reason, you know, after about a good five minutes of sleeping, I just, my  eyes open.  Nothing woke me up.  Just my eyes open.  Not a sound.  Nothing.  Just open your eyes. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, boy.  I look to the left.  Then I look to my right.  Out on my passenger side.  There's a guy looking in my window.  Oh, man.  Clean cut white guy.  Abercrombie and Fitch.  Yeah.  Fucking ties.  Clean.  And I'm looking at him.  Did you jump?  And I'm staring at him.  No.  No.  I don't get scared like that.  I can't fucking have anybody.  Movie fear fucks me up.  Like, you know, creepy shadow figures.  But, like, people don't. 
[02:44:00]  Dude.  Fucking any.  If I open my eyes and someone's there or something.  Bad day.  You gotta try to stay cool.  I almost got raped by that big black guy.  I had stayed cool.  You gotta understand how tinted my windows are.  You gotta understand this.  Now, I look at him to try to give him, like, for 30 seconds, we were looking at each other.  Like, just kind of staring.  So, I finally go, okay, this nigga ain't leaving.  I turn my key backwards, crack my window about an inch. 
[02:44:30]  I go, what's up, man?  He goes, it's cold out here.  It's cold.  It's cold out.  It's cold out.  I go, what?  He goes, it's cold out here.  And he tries my handle on my door.  He pulls my door handle.  Holy shit.  It's cold out here.  Pulls my door.  I go, what the fuck? 
[02:45:00]  I go, well, go inside.  There's coffee in there.  Now, I'm sitting there not thinking anything except for this is some crazy motherfucker who needs warmth.  And I'm going, well, you know, I'm sorry, dude, but, you know, you're not going to warm up in my fucking car, you know?  He thought you were a gangster fan.  And so, he walks away.  I'm looking at him.  And I'm still not, my energy still isn't like, what the fuck?  I'm just like, that was weird.  That's a little odd.  From New York, you know?  Yeah.  So, this, I watch him, this motherfucker gets into a Subaru Outback with a Christmas tree on top and drives away. 
[02:45:30]  And that's when, that's when the adrenaline kicked in.  I said, this motherfucker, he was going, he was going to suck strange black dick before he went home to take a Christmas tree to his fucking family.  It gave me, it was like drinking 14 cups of coffee and a Red Bull. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, you were awake.  Once I said, this guy was a fag.  I didn't know.  I thought he was just a creepy cold guy.  He's a creepy cold guy.  A little cold.  I felt so bad for women that this guy, I wanted to, it was almost like I let something evil escape.  Like, I wanted to follow him and just go and go, this guy is, ma'am, your husband is trying to suck strange gangster cock. 
[02:46:30]  And it was just like Gangsta Fag Song.  It was a well-dressed fucking businessman type sucking dick at a Connecticut restaurant.  Right, dude.  Wow.  It was un, it's cold out here.  What?  It's cold out here.  That's something that you say.  And pulls my fucking, my handle on my door.  Like you felt like you let something evil escape like that.  It felt like I let him, like I should have, like for the duty of the world, like just chase this guy. 
[02:47:00]  Because you think the family he's bringing that fucking Christmas tree home has any clue?  That their husband is sucking rest stop dick and has a rest stop code.  Like I'm going, if I was a fag, is that the code?  It's cold out here.  Oh.  Oh, the pigeons fly in January.  Hop on in, faggot.  Hop on in.  Click.  The door unlocks.  Click, click.  You think he drove away with Christmas music in his car.  And then he gets in and runs his hand like, it really was cold out there.  That was the fag code, but it's chilly. 
[02:47:30]  I'm just cold helping a brother out.  That's what got me was the Subaru Outback.  And I just covered my mouth like, like I just let, I let evil go.  I let it go.  I let it, I should have followed him.  Honey, honey, I'm home with the tree.  Get the kids.  And he, with the dude, I shouldn't even care about shit like that.  You know what I'm saying?  It's just, it seems so evil.  Yeah.  So fucking evil.  Wow.  Wow.  It's cold out here.  It's cold out here.  Well, anyone ask that way to read the signs though. 
[02:48:00]  You dummy.  I such a, I'm so, I'm a fag.  You told him to go into the McDonald's.  Like that wouldn't be your first thought if you were really cold.  Get my dick sucked at McDonald's?  Wait a minute.  Yes.  But listen.  Fuck.  Thank you, Patrice.  I was really stupid.  I wasn't sure if I should go into this really warm building in your car.  Now that you're telling me, of course I should go in the building.  I deserve the pounding you're about to give me.  But it's like, none of my reaction was, you fucking faggot. 
[02:48:30]  It was, it's cold out here.  Huh?  And my mind was trying to think of a way, and this is what I was thinking.  Not get out of here, fag.  It was, hey, I can't, I can't let you warm up in my car.  Yeah.  I mean, God bless you.  It's going to be cold and it's a cold day, but go inside.  I'm surprised you didn't tell the guy, what, did they lose their heat in there?  You need some money for coffee?  Yeah, you dummy.  Wow.  Let's go to Paul the trucker. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, Paul, what's up?  It's what, hold on, hold on, Paul, sorry.  Yeah, fuck the McDonald's or anything.  He had his own car.  No, I didn't see it.  Warm in his car.  Holy shit, even better, Patrice.  I woke up to see him.  So you didn't know he had the car until later.  I didn't even see this motherfucker.  I woke up to see him at my passenger side with his face in my shit.  But that even confirms it more because, let's say he was a fucking drunk and he got thrown  out of McDonald's, and that's why he was cold.  Like, you can even rationalize that until he gets in his own car that fucking, like, 
[02:49:30]  has heat.  Someone's making a great point here, Brian in Rhode Island.  Go ahead.  Brian, go ahead.  Hey, didn't Patricia say that it was like three in the morning?  What the hell's this guy doing getting a Christmas tree at three in the morning?  That's, that's, dude.  This is the whole.  It might have been his prop.  The whole evil was going through my head like, honey, I'm on the way.  I worked late.  I'm on the way home from blah, blah, blah. 
[02:50:00]  Dude, he had a family because he had a Subaru outback and a Christmas tree on top.  No, it's like, it was so after that is when it kicked in.  The creepiness of it kicked in then.  And I thought of it.  What the fuck are you doing out here with a Christmas tree at three?  You're just coming.  Hey, it's four, honey.  You know, I picked up a Christmas tree from the all-night Christmas tree place.  Yeah.  Up on Connecticut Boulevard.  And this mother, man, dude, it, it, it, it's cold out here. 
[02:50:30]  He was on some kind of fucking little business thing where he tells the wife, you know, I'm  going to be working late.  He's just perusing black men porno sites, getting himself all worked up.  Has the Christmas tree.  Three in the morning, he figures he better get home.  And then he sees the rest stop.  Here we go.  And you're just a prize right there.  I was, I was, I was the grand prize.  Merry fucking Christmas.  You might as well put a bow around your fucking, a mistletoe on your belt buckle. 
[02:51:00]  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Here's a black gentleman for you.  It's coming early, baby.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, shit.  And what do you want, successful white man?  I'd like a black gangster cock.  Right here in the rest stop.  And I, and I am so, like, if you don't know me, you know, you know, I just like to dress  that, dress the part.  Yeah.  But, you know, I'm a comedian.  But my whole out thing is like, you know, giant black dude.  I'm in a tinted up truck. 
[02:51:30]  I got my damn, my hoodie on, my this and that.  Yeah.  And this guy's impression of that would be, I'm not walking up to his fucking vehicle  and asking directions.  I'm not, I'm not going for legitimate purposes to your fucking vehicle and knocking on the  window while you're sleeping.  But, and he just was looking like, I can't, I can't even like, was it crazy man stare?  It was just looking.  That stare of wanting.  That stare of wanting.  That stare of wanting.  But then when he said, when he, when he made his move, when he made his move, he didn't 
[02:52:00]  look at me.  He turned to the, so his profile was at my window.  His good side.  So when I rolled the window down a little bit, what's up?  And it just, he didn't look me in the eye.  He didn't have the common decency to look you in the eye, to ask for the cock.  That's cold out here.  It's cold out here.  All right, let's go to Paul.  He's a trucker.  He has reepy shit.  Paul the trucker, what's up?  The rest of us have like become the new gay bathhouses of America, but I was in Gwinnett,  Georgia, and I stopped and I was waiting to go pick up a trailer. 
[02:52:30]  And I was there for about five or six hours.  I went in to use the bathroom and the phone rings, you know, the pay phone.  And I'm like, okay, whatever.  I keep going, come back, the phone rings again.  And I'm like, oh, okay, I'm ditching myself thinking I'm not in the twilight zone.  So I get in the truck and maybe something to eat, go back out, get a soda out of the  vending machine.  His phone rings again.  I'm like, all right, what's up?  So I'm looking around.  I pick the phone.  The guy's like, oh, suck your cock.  And I'm going, huh, what?  I'm looking around the phone.  Holy Jesus.  So I hang the phone.  I'm walking back and this cop pulls up and he's just laughing his ass off. 
[02:53:00]  And I go, what's so funny?  He goes, you answered the phone, didn't you?  I go, yeah, why?  Because I was watching, he goes, there's probably some gay guy in a car over here wanting to  blow you.  And I was like, what?  He's like, oh, yeah.  He goes, this is like the prime homosexual hangout.  And they know the pay phone number?  What they do, yeah.  They pull up and they hit the pay phone number.  Then when you walk by, they dial it and you pick up.  It's like, oh, suck your cock.  Oh, just like, holy Jesus.  Fag's a genius.  Because if I started to beat the shit out of that motherfucker, all he said was, it's cold 
[02:53:30]  out here.  It's cold out here.  He didn't go, I'll jerk your balls.  Right.  It's like they're so covert.  Just to get in.  Keep up the good work, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Paul.  You know what it's like?  It's like Dracula.  You got to invite him in.  See, that's what, it's cold out.  And you had to then invite him in in order to make the next step.  When he knew I wasn't a fag, he immediately bounced.  But it wasn't like, okay, it wasn't like, oh, sorry, he's not a fag. 
[02:54:00]  I didn't mean it.  He left.  Like, you ever see that thing in the Godfather where they say, listen, you don't run, you  don't walk.  Don't look no one in the eye, but you don't look away either.  Don't look away either.  That's how he left.  He just goes, oh, all right.  And walked calmly away.  Like, almost like he knew I would be in shock if I wasn't a fag.  Right.  Don't give you any time to really think about it.  Just leave the situation.  Oh, we were just talking about, uh.  Snakes on a plane. 
[02:54:30]  Snakes on a plane.  What's that hissing?  It's a snake on a plane.  Snakes on a plane.  We were saying he should just substitute all of his Pulp Fiction lines and just put them  in the movie.  Just, seems like that's what happened.  That's some tasty oatmeal.  Snake?  You read the Bible, snake?  Snake?  This is some repugnant mother effing.  Stop that hissing.  What are we going to do about the snake? 
[02:55:00]  How are they going to pull this off like you guys are saying during the break?  How is this movie going to be pulled off?  I just want to know.  It's got so much hype and everyone's like goofing on it before it comes out and talking  about it.  I've been hearing about snakes on a plane since, uh, what, like Thanksgiving?  Oh, man.  It's been months.  It's been a really long time.  They've been hyping this movie for almost a year.  Nine months.  Finally, as per, uh, E-Rock, they had to rewrite the film a lot because, uh, during, I guess,  some of the quick screenings they've given people, they didn't like the fact that Sam,  uh, Jackson didn't use the, uh, MRF-er enough, which is one of his, you know, everyone loves 
[02:55:30]  hearing him use that, uh, phrase.  He's still in the Jedi, though.  It wasn't cursing enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's still in, he's still in, he's still in, he's still in, he's still in, he's still in  his, he's still in, he's still in, he's still in, he's still in, he's still in,  the force, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, my children.  Mace Windu, whatever the hell his name was.  But they, uh, yeah, they wanted more, him cursing more, and more snakes, I guess.  There weren't enough, not enough snakes on the plane!  You need a lot of snakes on the plane.  It's just one snake? 
[02:56:00]  That sucks.  And how did he get on the plane with the snakes?  I don't know!  But I'm on a plane!  But I'm on a plane full of snakes!  They must not be liquid!  Snakes!  Snakes ain't liquid!  People are saying the movie's good, man.  RottenTomatoes.com is giving it 77% good rating.  What does that mean?  RottenTomatoes is the best website for movie reviews, because they take all the reviews  from all the papers all over America, and then they give you a nice average. 
[02:56:30]  Because your local guy might just be...  There's Rotten Tomatoes on the motherf***ing plane!  Because your local movie reviewer could just be a douche.  Yeah.  You know, so you get the balance of the entire country, and then you can figure out a little  better if the movie's going to be alright.  I think they must have geniusly pimped, because it's almost like when somebody attacks you,  you attack yourself to give it less fire.  Yeah.  I think they're making this movie purposely trying to say, oh, this is goofy and it's  awful.  And they're like, okay, we're going to review it as a goofy, awful movie. 
[02:57:00]  And for a goofy, awful movie, it's just fantastic.  Did you ever see a sign on the plane that said, live snake storage, Jules?  Hey, uh...  Whoopi's on the plane!  I thought it was snakes, but it was a hair!  Whoopi's motherf***ing hair is on the plane!  I thought we had snakes on a plane!  It's scaring the passengers!  It's just Whoopi's hair! 
[02:57:30]  It's Whoopi's dreadlocks on a motherf***ing plane!  Damn, now we don't have a movie!  Hey, that snake bitch, are you okay?  Nah, I'm...  Nah, man.  I'm far from...  I'm pretty f***ing far from okay.  Okay.  Whoopi's gonna get some hard pipe-hitting s*** over here.  Work on Whoopi Goldberg with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  They're gonna get medieval on your ass. 
[02:58:00]  Negro, that's all you had to say!  Yeah, Marsalis, there's snakes on a plane!  Snakes on a motherf***ing plane!  What are they gonna think up next in Hollywood?  Snakes on a plane!  Hey, Kyle in New York!  I love it! 
[02:58:30]  Kyle?  Hey, man.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead.  You saw Snakes on a Plane last night, right?  Yes, it was the best movie of the summer.  By far.  Wow.  Wow, look.  The summer didn't have a lot to choose from.  How about birds in a car?  There's a bird!  Screw bird!  How about a bee in your car?  Now, that's frightening.  There's a bee in the car!  God damn!  I got to get these Padkeets to the Padkeet asylums for Padkeets! 
[02:59:00]  Without getting eaten by the snakes!  God damn!  Otters and a canoe!  Holy moly!  They got big teeth!  Hit them with a horn, dummy!  Oh, my God! 
[02:59:30]  I can't get past bees in a car, though.  Bees in a car!  Because that's frightening, man.  When you're driving and you just hear...  You look, I'll be making a fly.  Please be a fly.  It's a bee!  No!  It's not just weaving all over the road.  Damn, bee in a car!  Bee in a car!  Bee in a car!  I ain't gonna get a gun stung by no mother...  Bee in no mother...  Car!  This summer. 
[03:00:00]  Bees in a car.  Well, that's how Hollywood works, so you know these are common.  If there's any success with snakes on a plane...  They'll just throw something in some form of transportation.  There's fish in the post office!  I'm trying to mail something!  And there's fish in the post office!  Sharks.

Stuff of legend.  It really is.  I suggest you go to YouTube and check out the entire performance of him just taking on the entire crowd. 
[03:15:00]  But we have some highlights here.  A little booing going on.  There were a couple of little booers out in the crowd.  Yeah, we should set this up again just in case people weren't listening yesterday there, Jimmy.  What was the vibe?  I mean, what was going on?  It was getting rough.  They booed Jimmy Schubert early.  I mean, again, Philly is notoriously rough.  And then Tracy got them back.  And, you know, the show was going well, but Philly crowds were always on the verge.  They were right on the brink at any minute. 
[03:15:30]  And the second half of the show started, Bobby Kelly went out and just kicked ass.  Boss killed.  Everybody, for the most part, killed.  Jimmy Schubert was destroyed.  I'm going to give Drew Boogie some props.  He did a great job as a DJ, man.  He held it together.  I mean, believe me, that's a lot more important than people realize to keep the music going,  keep people happy with what they're listening to.  And then Bobby Kelly kills.  Don Marrera goes out.  He's doing well.  And then he loses them a little bit.  They boo him a little bit, which is really weird to see a raring at Boogie. 
[03:16:00]  He's such a good comic.  I know, and a legend.  But it was late.  And again, these psychos have been drinking since 11 a.m.  So, I mean, they're getting a little rowdy.  They booed him a little bit, but he handled it.  He handled it better than Schubert did, because Schubert, I think, just went on autopilot.  Whereas Dom kind of, I think, addressed it a little bit or slowed down.  Whatever he did, he made it work and he left.  Billy Berry comes on.  And from what I saw, Bill's first bit or something didn't work, which happens a lot to us as comics.  You know what I mean?  You just come on and your bit doesn't hit.  It's no big deal.  You want to open strong, though, don't you? 
[03:16:30]  But you do.  But again, Billy is in a position on the show where everybody knows him and likes him and he's really funny.  So, he doesn't have to prove himself.  It's like, if you're bombing for 10 minutes, they're going to give you a hard time.  But one bit, they'll usually, yeah, no big deal.  But I think Bill got annoyed at them because they booed Herrera and said something to them about it.  I was watching this on a monitor.  And then they started booing him.  Started booing Bill.  And it got really loud.  And I'm like, are they booing Burr?  And then I just heard him snap.  And he had a moment of clarity. 
[03:17:00]  He was going to go down and bomb horribly.  Or he was going to attack back.  And he attacked back.  He knew.  In a lovely fashion.  He had time backstage to say to himself, look, if this happens to me out there, I know how I'm going.  I know what direction I'm taking.  He was a third guy.  So, he threw his act away.  Yep.  And then just improv for like 12 minutes.  And just beat up Philly.  Slammed him.  Everyone is talking about this.  Everybody's talking about this performance.  So, Tham, what's the first clip?  Him getting into the rant? 
[03:17:30]  Uh, yeah, that's when the wheels start.  Well, the wheels don't come off, I guess, because he killed.  But, yeah, it's just him.  It's none of his actual, like, normal bits.  Right.  It's just the start of when he starts losing it.  Okay.  So, yeah.  The setup, basically.  He did his act.  He started doing his act.  The booing started.  And he said, you know what?  Screw you all.  And this is what started to happen.  You don't stop talking, do you?  Like, ah, f*** it.  I'll just cook this side for a while.  I'll do it. 
[03:18:00]  You know what's funny?  I'm cooking my brain, talking about nothing.  I can't.  I'm just walking around like, yeah, I just got a cheeseburger.  Oh, f*** all you people.  You know what?  You f*** losers.  I hope you all f*** die.  And I hope the f*** Eagles never win the Super Bowl.  Let's f*** you guys.  F*** all you f***ers.  I f*** the players.  F*** all you.  You know what you got?  You f*** losers.  You're the dumb, I'm the rarest.  F*** this f***.  All you.  F***. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, f***.  How's that?  No.  I'm segwaying into my next joke.  Get all real f***ing my f***ing red f***ing all of you.  You line up in your Harold Carmichael f***ing jerseys, and one at a time, you get all f***ing my f***ing.  Oh, my God.  How many beefs are in that?  Was that the beginning of the tirade right there?  Oh, yeah.  It's funny.  You could see Bill with the line about the cheeseburger.  As a comic, you could see right there, he's really floundering internally going, all right. 
[03:19:00]  That was his moment of truth.  Right.  I'm going to try to just turn this around with this, and then they gave him a little hard time.  That was him standing at the crossroad right there.  It was like, all right, do I continue with the cheeseburger joke?  Just talking, because I think he felt, again, like you said, the wheel's coming off.  He was trying to steer, all right, let me get back off the shoulder here.  And then he just kind of struck his wheel rolling in front of the car, and he just aimed for the children.  Is this worth playing with all the beeps? 
[03:19:30]  I think it's, at least play a couple of clips.  I think it's funny with the beeps to just show how vicious it was.  It is funny with the beeps.  It was, yeah.  Please play a little.  It took me over two hours to do.  All right, no problem.  But the people listening on XM, don't worry.  Later on this morning, we're going to play the whole thing in entirety without the beeps.  That's right.  No bitching.  You'll have to hear a couple commercials, but aside from that, we'll play it for you.  No bitching.  Bill's thing is sponsored by Bud.  And for the people that don't have XM, just go to YouTube and throw Opie and Anthony in the search, 
[03:20:00]  and you'll get to see this for yourself as well.  Or get XM.  Or get it.  You chiselers.  How about you throw that out there as an option?  No, you've got to balance the two here.  Don't you get what's going on?  Well, he means today, too.  If you push XM too much, then the people down the hall here get pissed.  Oh, I know.  And if you don't push XM enough, then XM down there in Washington gets pissed.  It's a balancing act.  We're like spinning plates here.  I'm looking at poor Elo's face over here on Pal Talk. 
[03:20:30]  And, you know, I just figured, hey, there's an option, perhaps.  Do you think I was saying it without saying it?  That's how smart I am.  I was keeping everybody happy.  I don't like his creepy goatee.  It hasn't grown in yet.  I don't care.  He looks Puerto Rican and I don't like it.  All right.  Here's some more.  Bill Burr takes on Philly on stage at the Tweeter Center.  This is where he gets into the whole cancer thing.  Harold Carmichael jerseys, by the way, made me really happy.  I got to be a part of the him I was in the book. 
[03:21:00]  David McAllister's 52 hours into a show.  The what am I going to do at this point?  You people are going to God damn acid.  We up here talking about Hitler.  That ain't going to work.  Why don't we talk about it?  Okay.  Throw out some pockets.  Let's talk about heart disease.  You're all going to die of it.  And I'm going to laugh.  It's going to be great.  You're all going to get cancer, which is fantastic, because all your nets are shaved anyway. 
[03:21:30]  No one's even going to notice.  You're going to get fired for coming to work too late, because then I can notice that you  have bone marrow cancer.  The only thing that's going to give it away is me laughing at you in the background.  You bunch of losers with your cell phone pictures.  You're a fucking stupid bitch.  Fee, Fee, Fee, Fee.  Fee, Fee.  And then he starts counting down how many more minutes he has. 
[03:22:00]  Because when Dom started getting booed, he cut his set.  Bill's like, I'm not cutting my set.  I'm doing it every single minute I was supposed to do it.  He's counting down every minute he's doing.  That takes balls.  Is it worth playing?  We'll continue.  I just love hearing the beeps, actually.  At the end there, I don't even know what he was saying.  It was just beep, beep, beep.  Well, then he got into the Ben Franklin Bridge down there in Philly.  I hope you all get in your fourth focuses.  You're right off the side of that faggot-ass Ben Franklin Bridge. 
[03:22:30]  You one bridge heaven.  He's a city that no one gives a about.  The terrorists will never bomb you people because you're worthless and no one cares about you.  You are this diapod, New Orleans.  I hope your mother has herpes and the center of her and you go home tonight and get smitten on your and some other hermit happens and falls cancer. 
[03:23:00]  We love all of you.  Eleven minutes left.  Eleven minutes.  Oh, did he go on?  You're one step above New Orleans.  No one cares about you.  No one cares about you.  Oh, wow.  Should we go on?  I can't get enough of this now.  Let's say at least one more.  You have to.  You have to.  Then he goes after Rocky and the Eagles.  That was great.  Rocky is your hero. 
[03:23:30]  The whole pride of your city is built around a faggot that doesn't even exist.  You got to faggot Joe Frazier is from there, but he's black so you can't faggot deal with him.  So you make a faggot statue for some three-foot faggot you stupid, really cheesy, faggot jackasses.  I hope that cheese melts your faggot faces off.  All of you collectively faggot off.  Nine hours into a faggot show. 
[03:24:00]  Look at you in your faggot Donovan McNabb shirt.  I hope he snapped both his faggot ankles.  The first goddamn day.  I hope you go home in 16.  I can't faggot.  Eight minutes left.  Eight faggot minutes left.  This is one for the ages.  Wow.  One for the ages.  Oh, my God. 
[03:24:30]  He started getting some huge laughs until he went after the Eagles, and then the booing  got louder.  The cheese melts on your face.  He was just throwing every icon, every Philly icon at them.  That cheese steaky, but that cheese melts all over your face.  You want more?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Here he goes after the Phillies.  What's like the Phillies?  That faggot ass team hanged out for a female horse?  You want your pussy?  You want one f***ing World Series since 1880? 
[03:25:00]  You want one f***ing Girls?  We'll talk across and back on the dead, you f***ing jackasses.  Maybe you'll win another one.  It ain't ever happening.  It ain't ever f***ing happening with your red candy, striped, wagging f***ing uniforms.  Your team should be selling cotton candy and the f***ing is crushing a leaf.  You got a soccer team?  That's all I got left, huh?  You got a f***ing ping pong team.  That's all I got. 
[03:25:30]  Team that's never going to win a championship.  You're not going to win a Super Bowl since they had fake masks, you f***ing jackass.  Throwing Gabriel running around a f***ing blanket, a f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing.  Is he a dad or something?  You don't know who the f***ing he is.  Fire my f***ing shirt on the f***ing.  Push the Banana Republic, get the $20 shirt off the rack.  He's just making this up.  He's just throwing, he's windmilling. 
[03:26:00]  Windmilling.  Love it.  This is just a taste, by the way.  It was 12 minutes.  Yeah.  We have two more close.  We might as well play them.  They're short.  So anyway, back to the show.  I got a computer recently, people.  F***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing.  I'm putting two minutes left.  The last two minutes is going to be my rider for the rest of the f***ing floor.  I know on first, I do three minutes. 
[03:26:30]  That's it.  I come on here with a f***ing gun, right?  That's what I do.  I come on with a f***ing gun, hollow tip bullets, and I just got f***ing shooting people.  Okay?  And everybody's chained to their f***ing chairs.  I just blow all your f***ing brain out.  Like, just one after another.  Just f***ing one.  Two to the back of the head.  Never ending.  Come on out like a f***ing Mexican with those two f***ing crosses of bullets.  And just blow all your f***ing brains out.  I really enjoy blowing everybody's brains out.  Just f***ing this. 
[03:27:00]  The next day, somebody's mopping up.  The three pounds of f***ing brains that are actually in this goddamn crowd.  One minute left in the period.  The three pounds of brains that are in this crowd.  He was...  He's just there screaming about how he wants to shoot everybody in the head.  What a maniac. 
[03:27:30]  One minute in the period.  And this wasn't his act.  I just gotta keep saying that.  Oh.  He wrapped up.  All right, listen.  This doesn't change anything, this set.  I still f***ing hate you people.  I hate this f***ing scene.  I hate the way you eat.  You're a little f***ing ass f***ing subway.  And why don't you f***ing go suck it for Joe Frazier and get that f***ing ticket.  You guys all gonna go see Rocky 19?  Yeah, dude. 
[03:28:00]  I think it can win.  All right, listen.  I'm out of time.  You guys.  You guys were here, man.  Thank you very much.  All of you go f***ing yourselves in your a*****.  Have a good night.  And there you have it.  Just a taste.  Oof.  Just a taste.  It's the video everyone's talking about today.  And you can check out the actual video on YouTube.  Throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, because to see him, the energy in him was amazing. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  He's pacing like a panther.  Yeah.  And just swiping at people.  It was great.  And we'll play it unedited over at XM, the entire thing.  Yeah, relax.  Don't worry.  Let's say, oh man, I lost the guy I wanted to talk to.  The guy in Pittsburgh said it's the greatest thing he's ever heard.  Let's say hi to Richard in St. Louis.  Richard.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  I went home straight after work, watched that video, laughed my ass off.  It's the funniest thing I've seen since the beasting video. 
[03:29:00]  It's sent out to everybody.  Oh, that's very cool.  It's like crazy.  Yeah, that's how you spread the virus.  You can use that video to help us along.  Oh, yeah.  YouTube is going to help you guys out tremendously.  Loved it.  Thanks.  All right, Richard.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Mike.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, the best part of the Billy Burr thing is when he's doing the countdown.  Beep, beep, beep.  Seven minutes.  Seven minutes, yeah.  He ain't leaving.  All right.  He was like, I'm not leaving.  Right.  Go screw. 
[03:29:30]  Let's go to Greg in New York.  Greg?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This is so funny.  Watch it last night when I got home.  Hilarious is ass.  But one that pointed out, I'm pretty sure, is talking about the Eagles.  Yeah.  They haven't won a championship since they've invented a face mask.  Yeah.  Talking about the leather helmets.  So funny.  One other note, just real quick, on your letterman.  Have you seen the edited with Anthony's hand over Opie's mouth? 
[03:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty funny, actually.  Oh, the photoshops that people have been doing.  Yeah.  So funny.  Cool.  Take care.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  Someone's asking Dan from Long Island, what was the atmosphere like backstage when Bill  got off stage?  Was he pissed?  Was he pissed?  Are we allowed to say pissed over here?  I don't even know.  Sure.  He was...  Well, what I...  Oh, sorry.  What I noticed was when Bill, like, started getting booed, the whole place backstage was  like, what?  We've got to see this.  Yeah.  And everyone went to the side stage.  And halfway through it, people, I'm not kidding, were falling down, high-fiving. 
[03:30:30]  They loved it.  They couldn't control themselves.  And I think Bill was going to walk off like this effing crowd, but then when he saw the  reaction backstage, I think he realized he was onto something, right?  I don't know.  I was actually worried about going on, so I was kind of concentrating on that.  And it was odd.  I watched what he was doing, and I just kind of felt like, yeah, he got him back.  It was great to watch, man.  It was great to see him pull that nightmare and make it something.  And he made it something really funny.  And the crowd, as much as they wanted to smash him, respected what he did. 
[03:31:00]  He got 10,000 people to turn around and respect.  They loved him when he left the stage.  Oh, yeah.  He got a tremendous ovation.  Gave him a huge ovation when he was done.  Except for one guy in the front row, wanted to beat him up.  Yeah.  One guy was truly, like, just hated him.  Relax.  Yeah.  Relax, ass.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  You know, I watched that on YouTube this weekend, and it is amazing how he alienated  that crowd, brought them back, and did it again, like, six times. 
[03:31:30]  They would boo, cheer, and boo.  Yeah.  Awesome.  How did he do that?  You guys did.  Right when he started getting them back, he would hit them with something they really are  passionate about, like their sports teams.  Yeah.  And he'd just nail them without a boo.  He'd lose them.  He'd go, ah, go F you, F you.  And then he'd bring them back again.  Amazing.  The pictures are up on opianthony.com.  You see the crowd.  E-Rock was taking pictures of the crowd during the thing. 
[03:32:00]  And you see a ton of people, like, standing up and clapping, but then you see guys leaning  all the way back to get their boo heard.  Yeah.  All in the same shot.  Yeah, putting their hands around their mouth, like, really trying to get a loud boo out.  Let's say hi to Ryan in New Jersey.  Ryan.  Showed him.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, Ryan.  I started watching yesterday when I was at work on YouTube, and the funniest part is  when that guy that wanted to beat him up, he called him out and said, what are you going  to say, sir?  Something intelligent?  Something from a guy who never made it out of the fifth grade? 
[03:32:30]  Everyone has their favorite parts.  All right.  Let's go to Tony in Buffalo.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Absolute best download ever.  Opie, I got a green thing yesterday when you said when you kept watching, you kept taking  more and more things out, I watched that thing for 45 minutes, and it got funnier and funnier.  Burr Burr is just, he's a riot.  He's awesome.  All right.  Right on, man.  Thank you.  Let's go to Pete in Jersey.  Pete.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[03:33:00]  Hey.  I was at the show on Saturday, and the best part of the entire Bill Burr rant was when  he goes, if the Flyers even exist, you could put ice capades on the air.  You could put ice capades on.  Let's go to Ted in Philly.  Ted.  This is what it is.  That's great.  Ted.  Yes.  Let's go.  Hey, Ted.  Yeah, I was at the stadium on Sunday, or on Saturday night, and I was sitting up on  the lawn, and everybody was sitting there on the left-hand side going nuts. 
[03:33:30]  You guys still even there?  Yeah, we're listening.  We're listening.  We're really good listeners.  Your storytelling skills stink.  Well, everybody on my left was absolutely going nuts, Bill and Burr, and then all of a  sudden, he would say something, and the entire crowd would unite and boo, and then on the  right-hand side, we'd all start going nuts when he actually started being funny again.  I tell you, it's one of the best sights I've ever seen.  Got to thank Ted, because he kind of let us know when the segment was pretty much done. 
[03:34:00]  I know.  You took a fun, interesting story, and you built a quick brick wall up.  Congratulations.  You're a drunk driver in a limousine on the way to a reception.  Congratulations, Ted.  Good job.  Everyone was having fun, and now just tragedy.  That's right.  I guess so.  You're a 6'1", blood alcohol level, plowing into the bride and groom. 
[03:34:30]  Ladies and gentlemen.  One of the heroes.  You know, you've heard a lot about heroes, I'm sure, today, watching the news coverage.  It pales in comparison to the hero that is in our studio right now, Mr. Bill Burr.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, gentlemen.  Wow.  We just discussed your...  What did you guys do this weekend?  Oh, Jesus.  We just discussed your set in Camden.  Discussed it.  We watched it in the office.  It's already a bootleg on YouTube.  I watched it at home last night.  I cannot get enough of it.  It is the most watchable act I've ever seen. 
[03:35:00]  It's like, you could look at it, you could watch it ten times and catch something new every time.  Yeah.  Animals.  Yeah, I literally had a headache at the end of it.  I felt like I yelled at a relative.  You know what it reminded me of?  It's like somebody that should get the congressional medal for rushing a machine gun nest and actually living through it.  Like, and one man single-handedly took out an entire machine gun nest and bunker emplacement. 
[03:35:30]  Thought you were gone.  Thought you were dead.  You turn that around.  Can you walk us through it?  Because we just, we have no idea what really happened.  Here's what we know.  We're just getting phone calls and things like that.  You walked out on stage.  I guess it was after Dom Herrera.  No, it was actually, it was after the show was about three hours and 15 minutes old.  Right, okay.  And ideally, Jim, what would you say, about 90 minutes is the ideal comedy show?  Yes, and you want to go on probably 50 minutes into the 90 minutes at the latest. 
[03:36:00]  An hour at the latest.  Ideally, the people aren't drinking in a parking lot for seven hours before the three hours and 15 minutes starts.  It was basically, I don't know what had happened.  It turned into OzFest up on the lawn.  Yeah.  And they were booing guys.  Like, even guys who were doing well.  They were, they were, I was kind of walking to the side and they were booing and it was just getting worse and worse and worse.  So you heard where it was coming from.  I really had no, I, I, they kept saying it was up to the left. 
[03:36:30]  It sounded to me when I was out there like it was coming from everywhere.  But, so anyway, so then Dom goes out and Dom's doing a great job and it's just almost like they just decided.  Yeah, out of nowhere.  They're booing the guy and this is like, this guy's like from Philly.  Yep.  He's been doing it forever.  Half the reason they got comedy clubs in that damn city is because of this guy.  They boo him off like they don't even know him.  Unbelievable.  And he's, Dom's funny.  I mean, he doesn't deserve to be booed.  He's a great comic.  Exactly.  So, I was pissed and I went out there and the second I walked out, I was like, you know, hey, you know, whatever. 
[03:37:00]  I was walking down the street.  Did ya?  They started yelling and heckling.  Oh, boy.  And then it went into that Hitler bit and I was like, oh, no, they've been playing this on Opian Ante like 9,000 times.  And I kind of messed that up.  And then they started booing me.  And fortunately, I had been booed before.  And I had made mental notes about things that I did that I liked.  And there was a lot more stuff that I didn't like. 
[03:37:30]  So, I just, I had made a mental note the next time whatever happened.  I'm talking about all your mothers.  I'm trashing your city.  Anything I can think about and I'm not.  The Liberty Bell, Rocky, the Betsy Ross Bridge, Cheese Steaks.  The sports teams.  The fact they hate blacks.  The sports teams.  Exactly, Anthony.  I swear to God.  I already mentally worked it out.  If they started throwing stuff, I was going to go behind the DJ booth and I was still going to finish.  You were dedicated to finishing. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  I was in the back watching.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Again, because you couldn't hear the audience response from the monitors.  And I saw you go, what are you people not going to laugh?  Like, you just scolded them.  Like, Bill, because you are like, I hate to say money in the bank.  It's a faggot expression.  I mean, you never had bad sets, especially gigs like this.  I'm like, how could they give Bill a hard time?  And then you just went crazy.  It was so good.  And he made all this up.  So grateful.  Off the cuff.  And we need to tell people that again.  This wasn't your act.  This wasn't what you decided to do in Philly.  You were just making it up as you go along in front of 10,000 people. 
[03:38:30]  That, to me, I bow to you today.  That was the funny thing.  I had a bunch of people that had come up to me.  Not all those people afterwards.  Probably at least 15 people had come up to me and they were like, did you just make that up?  Or is that like part of your act?  Oh, no, no.  That's a 15-minute chunk of my act.  When I go to Seattle, I just go off on specific stuff about Philly and somehow it kills.  That's what I was amazed at, too.  It's like, God, this guy knows a lot about Philly.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, you should be gleaning tours there in your time off.  It was frightening. 
[03:39:00]  I mean, everything about Philly.  He just recalled stuff subconsciously that he'd heard in school.  It was like your whole brain worked for you.  And the team's old players from the Phillies.  Like he's just Roman Gabriel.  He's pulling up old players from Joe Frazier.  You mentioned Roman Gabriel.  And the lack of respect he gets.  Roman Gabriel.  You don't know who he is.  You mentioned him.  And then you screamed at them.  They're not going to win ever.  They're never going to win.  It was good to see the real Bill Burr finally. 
[03:39:30]  Because we know this is what you're really about.  Absolutely.  And then it finally came out for everybody.  It was fantastic to watch.  You saw the reason why I need to do this.  To me, when I was watching that, like watching you yell like that and just, just, just berate them.  I'm like, that's what Bill hears in his head every time he looks into the mirror.  I never loved anyone as much as I loved watching you do that.  And you completely turned them around when you were done.  And you did your little countdown every minute. 
[03:40:00]  Like I said, there's a teleprompt.  They're showing the comics how much time they had left.  And you'd berate the audience and they'd go, okay, six minutes.  And you kept going and going.  And I'm selling my CD.  Yeah, and I'm selling my CD.  And then you turned them around and they're laughing their asses off.  Now the laughs are much bigger than the boos, but the boos continued, right?  And you knew that you had them.  And then you're like, and I still hate you people.  Yeah, I still hate you people.  And when you left, they gave you a hell of an ovation just for, for doing that. 
[03:40:30]  I got to tell you, it was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.  I never saw a set like that in my life.  As far as comedy things go.  The brutal honesty of what you did and the fact that it was, it looked fearless.  I mean, as a comic, I understand how we are internally, but just the fact that you exploded  and weren't going to back down.  And they knew it.  He's not leaving.  He's not leaving.  He will not leave.  You can only boo so loud, so they just knew that you were going to kick 10,000 people  in the face for 15 minutes until your time was up, and it was just great. 
[03:41:00]  Tony Montana up on the balcony, getting shot.  Come on!  And that guy walked up to your back with a shotgun, and you turn around and you slapped  him with your hog.  Yeah, it was blind rage by the end.  Oh, yeah.  To the point when I got off, I wasn't even, I was really, when I walked back there, I didn't  know what the reaction of you was.  Dude, we all ran to the stage because, you know, the word spread.  Bill Burr is getting booed, and he's just attacking the crowd.  We all, every single person backstage just about was on the side stage just watching. 
[03:41:30]  We're jumping up and down.  We're hugging each other.  We're falling on the ground like idiots.  We loved it.  Having gay sex.  Right.  Just had a mention.  That's right.  That's what I told myself in the rest area last night.  This one's for Billy.  And someone bootlegged it.  It's up on YouTube.  And the word hasn't even really spread.  I mean, now it has, obviously, because we're talking about it.  But this morning, it was already downloaded thousands of times.  I'm like, man, people are talking about this thing. 
[03:42:00]  You go to YouTube and just throw Opie and Anthony in the search, and there it is.  It's there.  The first time I got booed, there's this amazing feeling when you just realize you can't get  him back.  And the first time I got booed, I didn't leave that time.  But I kept trying to do jokes or something.  It wasn't, I didn't leave or whatever.  And then they ended up bringing me up.  And people came up to me afterwards going, like, I got, like, these awful compliments.  Like, I thought you were funny.  Oh, hey, yeah.  And the best one was... 
[03:42:30]  You mean all the compliments Jimmy Schubert was getting after his set?  I mean, he just got thrown to the dogs.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy Schubert is hilarious.  Like, that was the thing, because I love Jimmy.  So I was pissed from the beginning of the show.  Yeah.  And having gotten booed, I know what he was going through.  And then he has got to stand there for the, what was it, the five hours.  And you two guys, Jesus Christ, before I go up, these two stand-up virgins, hey, we got  this great idea.  Oh, we were just trying.  We're going to walk 40 rows through the crowd. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  That's great.  Anything you can do to steal their focus more from the set and whip them in.  Hey, so we get credit for your brilliant set that people will be talking about for  years.  And then they go to the concert.  And right after we intro you 50 rows in, the two stars of the shows, we're just going  to cut off the lights, and they're not going to look at us and try to find out where we're  going.  I thought that was a little ridiculous, too.  Like, I was like, uh-oh, this could be distracting to the comedian.  We make it up as we go along.  What can I tell you? 
[03:43:30]  We won't do that again, Bill.  But Jimmy Schubert was your biggest cheerleader on the side of the stage.  He was jumping up and down, just applauding.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we were joking about that afterwards.  I was like, oh, I felt like we caught the last chopper on a nom.  We were going to look down and see, like, Dom Irera, like Willem Dafoe, in the tree line.  Oh, it was brutal.  It was unbelievable.  You must have seen him.  It was platoon.  You must have seen him, though, getting booed, know what it's like to be booed, saw what  the crowd is like, and kind of prepared yourself, like, if these sons of bitches even try, I 
[03:44:00]  am unloading.  My mindset when I walked out was, you animals, you don't even deserve a show.  I'm going to come out here, and I'm going to start tap dancing to try to get your attention.  You're not even giving anybody any chances.  So the second they started doing it, you were already locked and loaded, ready to go.  I'm talking about teams.  I'm talking about...  It's like, I don't know why I even ironed my shirt to come out here.  I don't even remember half the stuff I said.  Oh, my God.  It's total terrestre.  I've watched it like 10 times already.  It is all good, and it is all brutal. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  It's just fantastic.  I've never, ever seen a set like that.  I've never seen anyone handle a stupid heckler in a club is one thing.  You've got 10,000 people, and you just trashed them to the point where they loved you when  you left.  Stay tuned.  Still to come, more of the best of Obi and Anthony.

With the best of Opie and Anthony, 2006.  Mike, the trucker. 
[03:49:00]  What's up, Mike?  How are you today?  What's going on over there?  You guys rock.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, Mike.  I really appreciate that we rock.  Listen every day, do you?  Oh, yeah.  Every day.  Shit dicks are ripping off Ron and Ferris with the spy report.  What?  We've been doing that for years.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  That was a long one.  That's what you get.  Wait.  Why is he thinking of us?  Accusing us of ripping off another show. 
[03:49:30]  Come on.  Yeah.  I'll give you a fucking gymatorium and straighten you right out.  Exactly.  That's right.  Dave in Louisiana, what's up?  What's up?  Dave.  Yeah.  What's up, Dave?  Eh, not much.  You're ripping off Ron and Ferris.  Ripping off Ron and Ferris.  How long?  Do you remember in Boston?  Yeah, we started in Boston.  We started doing the spy report.  We just changed the name to spy report.  Yeah.  That's enough with Ron and Ferris.  We used to call it the Tattletale Report.  Yeah.  Back in the day. 
[03:50:00]  And then we wanted some more secret agent-y.  That's right.  So we started calling it Spy Report.  Well, after the Austin Powers movies came out.  Yeah.  We decided to, you know, make it sound a little cooler.  Why are they doing that?  I guess.  Is it something that they, uh...  Oh, God.  I'm sure they'll be doing Fat Tuesday soon.  Next thing, if I even hear someone call up and say that we've ripped off message board gossip,  I'm going to be pissed because that's our bit. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  We're going to start that tomorrow.  Yeah.  Remember we did that one time years ago?  It's been on the docket for months.  Oh, for months we've been, uh, talking about that.  We even had a little theme song for it and everything.  It was called Board Chatter originally.  Board Chatter.  Board Chatter.  And then, uh, um, Internet Gossip.  We kind of, and then we finally got it together to, uh, message board gossip.  And there was going to be a song, and as the song was playing in the background, it was  just going to be chitter-chat, chitter-chat, chitter-chat, chitter-chat, chitter-chat, chitter-chat, 
[03:51:00]  chat-chat.  And then we decided to just have Steve do it, because he says razzle-dazzle and it's funny.  Do we have the, uh, theme?  Oh, it's somewhere.  All right.  Someone else's machine.  Why don't we just, we should do a little board gossip, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Razzle-dazzle, it's board gossip with a little gossip, a little chat, a little high. 
[03:51:30]  That's odd, Alia.  Sounded like a clipping in there or something.  We might have to fix that.  I actually have some board gossip.  What do you got, uh, board gossip?  Yeah?  Uh, dugout dug.  Where's panties?  Uh, yeah, had a fight with Bam over angel fuck devil.  Cock Happy Typing Girl.  Well, actually, uh, Mike Rowe, uh, fucked Happy Typing Girl. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah?  Uh, yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's just the scuttlebutt.  He's gonna call it Bored Scuttlebutt.  Maybe we'll change the name so people don't get confused with other people's, uh, shows  ripping our bits off.  Scuttlebutt.  Why is Jimmy just staring out the window?  I'm thinking about things.  What are you thinking about?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Certain bits that we should do, uh, over, uh, the other side that we used to do? 
[03:52:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  And.  Oh, my God.  It's the worst.  When we should do them?  What do you got there?  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  This can't be good if you rock.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  What improperly recorded bit is that?  Hmm.  That's for our, uh...  Spy report.  Oh, that's for our new bit.  Yeah, it's already done.  Thank you, Steve.  Good. 
[03:53:00]  It plays once, then self-destructs.  Spy report.  Yes.  Up to the sky.  Anyway, that, uh, concludes another Opie and Anthony show.  Things like that dry.  Playing the song we play at the end of every Opie and Anthony show.  That's our music and our cue to get out of here.  I watch the floor.  I like to watch the TV.  Nothing. 
[03:53:30]  I'll be fine.  I'll be fine.  You all right?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  All right, well.  Where's our nigger producer?  What?  Too far?  We'll enjoy a little bit of, uh, Jimmy's Eyes of Love.  We end every, uh, radio show with this.  Yeah.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Why don't we turn that up a little bit?  See ya!  Hey!  See ya!  We'll be filled with parking cars. 
[03:54:00]  I watched it for a little while.  I love to watch things on TV.  See ya, that's good song, dude.  Satellite of Love.  I've been told that you've been bold with Harry, Mark, and John. 
[03:54:30]  Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday to Thursday with Harry, Mark, and John.  Satellite of Love.  I love to watch things on TV.  Things like that drive me out of my mind. 
[03:55:00]  I watched it for a little while.  Some other shows don't do.  I love to watch things on TV.  They leave.  We'd hang out and jam with it.  I love to watch things on TV.  Satellite of Love.  Satellite of Love.  Satellite of Love.  Satellite of Love.  Satellite of love 
[03:55:30]  Satellite of love  Satellite of love  Satellite of love  All right, buddy! 
[03:56:00]  Hey!  See you tomorrow.  Hey!  Hey!  I wish I had my cowbell to throw at somebody.  I don't know. They didn't bring it on to the other place today.  There's no cowbell today.  I usually have it right here.  Yeah.  What cowbell?  Get out of here, Jimmy! 
[03:56:30]  Throw it at Danny. I bet it hurts him real bad.  Needs more cowbell.  Let me see that cowbell.  Let me see that thing.  Hey there, Danny. 
[03:57:00]  Gang!  The Rana Fez walkover begins now on the Rana Fez Show on XM.  Isn't this nuts, Fez? We're walking down the street doing a show.  It's just crazy that we're able to be out here on the sidewalk, just walking along like anybody else, except that we're on satellite radio.  That's right.  That's the weird thing.  And whatever happens out here, we just roll with it.  Exactly. Because it's the streets of New York City, you don't know what could happen out here. 
[03:57:30]  So far, nothing.  Yeah. It's actually, I guess everyone's made it to work, and there's no lunch hour crowd yet.  Yeah, I thought it would be a little more exciting.  Yeah. Huh.  Not really much.  Oh, wait, there's a truck.  Yeah. A lot of cabs.  Yeah, a guy on a bike.  Yeah.  You see a lot of that, though, in New York City.  Yes.  Yeah.  During the walkover.  Hmm.  Huh.  It is the Ron and Fez walkover.  Oh, boy. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, here we go.  Nothing at all, huh?  Nope.  Nothing yet.  Oh, this isn't going to help.  No, not at all.  With missing the signal here.  No.  Yeah.  Mm-mm.  Yeah.  Now we've got to just kind of wait here on the corner.  Right.  What if we try this bit, Fez?  I have a cigar clip here.  Uh-huh.  You try to hail a cab with a cigar clip.  Okay, I'll try it.  All right.  Hail the cab with a cigar clip.  Cigar clip. 
[03:58:30]  Shit, I'm getting out of here.  I'm fucking getting out of here.  Come back.  Don't you leave me out here.  Just see if you can do it.  Don't you leave me out here.  You know, all the equipment's working really good today, too.  You know what?  The staff does a great job.  All the mics are working.  The headsets are working.  Everything's working.  We almost have like three people out here.  Yeah.  Any luck with the cigar clip?  Still can't get a cab.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Mm-mm.  I don't know whether it's an anti-smoking sentiment or what.  Yeah.  Hey, there's a homeless guy over there.  Uh-huh.  I make more money than him.  Oh, yeah.  Me, too. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  Hey, look.  His leg.  Yeah.  Completely healed.  Good.  Yeah.  That is good.  Leg looks fine.  Yeah.  Odd.  We're going to interact with these people.  Hi.  How are you?  No, no.  You don't want to interact with me.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Where are you guys from?  Jersey.  Monmouth.  Monmouth University, actually.  Oh, that's Eastside Dave's University.  Eastside Dave?  Yeah.  That's right.  You?  Yes.  Please don't bother the legends, sir.  I'm Club Soda Dave.  You're Club Soda Dave?  You can talk to the legends. 
[03:59:30]  Don't get too close to them.  I came from Monmouth.  Oh, this is amazing stuff.  Thank you, Dave.  It's really interacting on the street.  God, I thought this was going to go better.  Yeah.  This bit sucks.  It really does.  It just sucks.  Where are you guys off to?  ABC Studios.  All right.  We'll follow you there in a walkover.  No, no, don't.  Come on.  Here we go.  We're walking behind them.  We'll embarrass us.  Oh, jeez.  Don't kill our chances for getting on TV.  What show are you going to? 
[04:00:00]  I don't know.  Any of them.  Yeah.  By the way, the Jews run the media.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  So you probably should have checked with them for tickets.  Just trying to be edgy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you want to talk to an opinionated World War II veteran?  Yeah.  Opinionated World War II veteran.  Let's go.  Sure.  How are you?  It's my father, Tracy.  How are you, Tracy?  He's a very opinionated World War II.  He's been a member of the Art Students League for how many years, Dad?  How many years, sir? 
[04:00:30]  About 30 years.  30 years.  And you fought World War II?  Yeah.  Great.  And what are you guys talking about?  Well, my uncle actually died in a camp over there during World War II.  I was army amphibious.  Yeah.  My uncle died.  He fell off a gun power.  We're Nazis.  You know, it's an old joke, but it's still fun.  Yeah.  Tell him about your uncle Joe.  What happened with your uncle Joe?  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with Nazis.  Tell him about your uncle.  Let's wake at each other.  Tell him about your uncle. 
[04:01:00]  What happened with your uncle?  He was...  Ma'am, thanks for bringing this over to him.  He's great.  Your uncle Jack.  Uncle Joe.  Jack.  You had uncles, right?  Oh, your brother.  That's another story.  That's a whole thing.  No, during...  He was at the World War...  The World's Fair.  The original...  Oh, is that right?  Remember the original World's Fair?  Right.  My uncle got blown up at the 1939 World's Fair.  Your uncle got blown up at the 1939 World's Fair. 
[04:01:30]  The rights were a lot more dangerous then.  His name was Lynch.  Lynch.  He was the original one.  Joe Lynch.  God, this is great radio.  Plays for the Broncos now.  He was one of the originators of the bomb squad.  The bomb squad.  And blew up there in 1939?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I joined the service.  But other than that, everything else has been good since 1939?  Yeah.  And then the war?  I'm living.  I'm 84.  I'll be 84 on May.  84 years young.  That's what I say, sir.  Right, right, yeah.  84 years young. 
[04:02:00]  Correct.  16 Ghostmuckers time.  I'll give him another three, four years.  And we're off to...  We're going to go watch him sketch new models today.  Oh, is that right?  So you and your father are very, very close, right?  What happened?  You stick that in your face?  Um, uh, excuse me?  What happened?  Did he stick it in your face?  What happened?  No, um, we're off.  You can't find a goddamn cup of decaf in New York City.  You can't find a cup of decaf in New York City, Will.  Isn't that crazy?  Isn't that crazy? 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  It's the city that never stops being jittery.  Even monkeys fall out of trees, right?  Even monkeys fall out of trees.  I'll check her on.  God, I thought this was going to go better.  Get that out of her face.  She hates it.  One more time, young man.  What is he doing that's bothering you?  Excuse me.  Yeah.  He doesn't like it.  It's just improper.  It is improper to put that in your face.  So you and your dad.  Who the hell are you guys?  Uh, we are, uh, from XM Satellite Radio.  We are, wait, um, what's your name? 
[04:03:00]  We are the Lollipop Kids.  Lollipop Kids.  The Lollipop Guild.  Yeah.  That also came out in 39.  All right, we're going to let you guys go.  Thanks for being the greatest generation.  We really appreciate it.  Thank you.  It was a lot of fun.  That's our new character, opinionated World War II veteran.  Wow, I wish this would have worked out better.  It's really, really slow.  Really bad.  I think there would be more to do on a walkover.  Yeah, it's the worst walkover ever.  There's an amazing set of tits right next to me, though, but I'm not even going to look. 
[04:03:30]  No, I did.  I looked anyway.  Well, I've noticed a lot of, like, really successful-looking people out here with no physical deformities at all to comment on.  Right.  So that doesn't help at all.  Which we found a blind guy.  Right.  Something.  That's someone with a big head.  Yeah.  A bald guy would be nice.  What about a celebrity?  That would be nice.  That would be huge.  Yeah.  Or even someone who looked like a celebrity.  Nothing at all.  No.  Maybe instead of a walkover, we just do a sit-down and we hope people to come to us. 
[04:04:00]  Dave, that girl hated you, huh?  Yeah, she kept slapping the microphone away from Cluck Sawyer, Dave.  Just trying to do my job, man.  Just trying to give the artist some information.  All right, here's something you don't see every day of Black Nun.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe it's a costume.  No, I don't think so.  It's a Black Nun.  Well, that's something.  Yeah, I thought this whole thing would go better.  Yeah.  I thought it would be funnier.  Something to do. 
[04:04:30]  A little something out here.  For a guy who's amazingly short.  Nothing.  Nothing really to comment on, really.  No.  There's a man with a tie.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hey, Captain Ty.  Captain Ty.  Captain Ty.  Crazy Ty man.  There he goes.  All right.  Here's a warm one with a barrette.  Nothing.  Yeah.  These people are completely normal.  Here's a guy taking his trash for a ride. 
[04:05:00]  There you go.  So he's basically doing a walkover, too, but just his whole life is one.  Well, it's sad to see how far Idi Amin has fallen.  It's terrible.  You eat people, that's going to happen to you.  I guess it is.  I guess we'll just start and head back.  Yeah, I guess so.  It's not all that good.  A new bit.  Walkover with Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  I did want to stop and get some blueberries.  Sure.  Sure.  Careful, don't step in that guy's cake.  No.  Try to be kind to everybody, you see. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  If you're just nice, people are nice back, I think.  There's an ATM here, Fezzy.  I want to stop and check my balance.  I want to get to check a Fabergé egg on the way home.  Perfect.  Perfect.  It's a long walk.  I didn't realize how far it is.  How far it is.  I've got to get in shape.  Blowing up a little bit, huh?  Yeah.  Maybe practice this with a microphone on a treadmill.  Artists coming through.  Watch it.  Artists are coming through.  Thank you, Kenny. 
[04:06:00]  I want you to secure us until we get to our security.  And then have our security take us to a secure place.  I'd be obliged.  And I still don't feel so secure.  I don't like people being close.  Please don't look at them.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kenny.  Ready to head up?  Ready to head up.  Oh, there's our doorman.  Five foot feet, eight inches of just wonderful security there.  I always liked the guy.  Yeah, he's a great man.  Yeah. 
[04:06:30]  I always like to say good morning to him.  Okay.  Hmm.  Not the best of the walkovers.  Oh, what are you going to do?  Here's our badges.  Always best to follow rules.  Yep.  Yeah.  Always show the ID card.  That's the way it works around here.  What it is, Fez, it's having respect.  It really is.  Others will do their work.  Well, you know, Mr. Lopez here is just doing his job.  That's right.  Exactly.  And what a fine job you're doing. 
[04:07:00]  Gracias, Mr. Lopez.  What's gracias mean?  Thank you.  Say that.  Oh, thank you.  Geniuses shouldn't have to flash badges.  Okay, get ready to head up in the elevators.  You know something, Club Soda Dave?  I like just to feel part of the people.  It's really not right to act like we're any better or any worse.  If you say so.  Mm-hmm.  By the way, none of you will be riding in the elevator with Fez and I. 
[04:07:30]  Thank you.  Microphone's starting to cut out.  We're going to lose them in the elevator.  I don't think we will this time.  We can always just try.  Yeah, this time it's going to work.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  We'll see you scenes in the elevator.  Okay.  Yeah.  We'll see you next time. 
[04:08:00]  Okay.  Reach regularly.  We'll see you next time.  Bye.  Bye.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  We'll be right back. 
[04:08:30]  We'll be right back. 
[04:09:00]  I can't believe it. The stink there. Any reason why they want them to have their own elevators. Oh boy. I guess everyone's in the pisser. I don't know. I'm in here now. So the show's starting. All right. Here comes Ronnie. Here comes Ronnie.  You getting some breakfast there? 
[04:09:30]  There's no fucking turkey gumbo anywhere. I don't believe it.  Yeah. Soup man. You know what? No plugs for the soup man.  Fuck the soup man.  No plugs for the soup man till we start getting the turkey gumbo.  Where's Dave with the smoothies?  I'm fucking crazy.  I don't know why they can't bring over turkey gumbo. I don't understand it. 
[04:10:00]  Well, at least we get to put it on cruise control for a while.  The real show's over.  Yeah, it's done.  Just kind of kicked back.  Hey, where's all our comics?  What did they do? Read the Alan Sniffin fucking report?  Yeah, nobody here.  866-RON-ZERO-FEZ. It's 866-766-0339. 
[04:10:30]  The cold and flu spreading across the nation.  Oh, what the fuck is this?  It's crazy.  What the fuck is that?  R&F PARTY ROCK!  PARTY ROCK!  R&F PARTY ROCK!  R&F PARTY ROCK!  Remember, it's keep them in Wednesday.  Cow.  Keep your tits out of everybody's face. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah, who wants to see that?  Not me, thank you.  Remember, some yogurt.  So remember to get your Ron and Fez official cow stickers.  Or make up one yourself.  There you go.  Even though you'll never actually see a woman do it.  All these years, not one woman has done it.  That's true.  That's why you do it, keep them in Wednesday.  And then you think everybody's on board.  Where's our comics?  I want them to make fun of each other's shirts.  When we finish our food. 
[04:11:30]  Someone's got to be appearing somewhere.  Matt, you're on the air.  Hey, guys, I got a midget sighting.  Oh, good.  Hey, I'm down here in Arizona.  I got a day worker working with me.  Little hands, midget.  Go from there.  Go from there.  Go from there.  I don't think you really had a midget sighting.  Throw your radio away. 
[04:12:00]  Mango, you're on Ron and Fez.  Hey, Ron and Fez spread the virus.  I've got a great bit for you.  This never fails.  It'll always work out.  Get people to have sex in public places for points.  It's brilliant.  That sucked, sir.  That sucked.  It's actually too much work to keep this up.  It is a lot.  Yeah. 
[04:12:30]  We can just go back to laying down.  Oh, here's Doug out Doug.  Hey, Doug.  How are you?  Hey, bubble boys.  Hey, sweet tits.  Hey.  You guys got a show, a one-market bullshit show that's actually ripping off the cow.  They're calling it WOW for Whip-Em-Out.  And they're also ripping off Club Soda Dave's gossip, board gossip bit.  If you guys want, I can set up an R&F Annoyances war room right now in Pal Talk.  And we can stage a fake-ass bullshit radio war that'll self-promote everybody. 
[04:13:00]  And we'll take them out.  Wow.  What if we did have to put up with Doug out Doug all the time?  That would be so fucking annoying.  That would make me want to throw my radio out.  Seriously.  Okay, they have a message board they use.  It's called whackbag.com.  If you guys want to attack it, just say the word.  We're on it.  We're on it, guys.  The annoyances are with the Ron and Fez show.  The annoyances.  Seems a little long and not real catchy. 
[04:13:30]  Hey, Corey.  Corey, you're on the air.  Jerome!  Nice.  Oh, those Jerome callers crack me up.  That's Steve from Jellystone.  Denise, you're on the air.  Hey, guys.  I want to play What's in My Purse.  Oh, what's in my purse?  Mm-hmm.  It's exciting.  This is edgy.  All right.  Open the purse.  Take your time.  Open the purse.  Yeah. 
[04:14:00]  The way this works is she'll rub her phone along the inside of her purse.  Right.  And then we try to guess the items that are in her pocketbook.  Oh, what's in your purse?  Hold on.  Yeah.  I have to unzip it.  Okay.  I'm going to do it now.  Go ahead, you little tempters.  Go ahead.  Oh, did you hear that?  Let me do it one more time.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  I heard lipstick.  My guess is going to be lipstick.  All right.  I'm thinking it's a cell phone. 
[04:14:30]  Cell phone.  I'm going to go with cell phone on what's in my purse.  Actually, both of you are wrong.  What is it?  I have nasal spray and pens.  All right.  Don't be too excited.  All right.  Go take an aged shower.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes, Fezzy, I just let them have it.  Sometimes they deserve it.  They should just die.  Just absolutely keel over and die.  I think that's the end of it.  This is as far as we can go. 
[04:15:00]  Okay.  Stop paying attention to us now.  Stop posting things like, oh, this is great.  Well, you know it's not.  It's just us fucking around.  It's not all that good.  Best show ever.  Holy shit.  Shows are interacting.  This is why I don't work.  This is why I refuse to get a job.  Hey, everyone.  It's Enjoyable Typing Guy.  Man, you missed it.  You should have heard it.  They were parried.  It was great. 
[04:15:30]  Enjoying the show typing, guy.  It was great.  Now, my computer's probably all fucked up because I really can't speed type.  Yeah.  Don't try not to actually hit the buttons or at least ones that count.  Bronx Mark.  You're on Fez.  Hey, I've been waiting four weeks for my cow sticker.  Once I get here.

Yeah.  But then, 6 a.m., I just gave up.  By the end, I looked like a homeless person in the back.  I got to worry about the jokes.  Right.  And the story being good.  Nobody's going to go, God, Artie's shirt didn't match his belt.  The Ron and Fez Show, weekdays starting at noon Eastern.  On Raw Dog, SiriusXM comedy hits 99.

[04:24:30]  We're back with the best of Opian Anthony, 2006.  We're back with the best of Opian Anthony, 2006.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[04:25:00]  This is the Opian Anthony program.  Rich Fawcett's studio with his lovely wife, Bonnie, Nick Marlin.  Playing Cleveland this weekend.  Yeah, the Cleveland Improv.  We're going to do our acts together this time. 
[04:25:30]  Oh.  People will email us from MySpace.  So, do you guys go on stage together?  Yeah, all of a sudden we're fucking still in a mirror.  I can't even get her to bang me.  I'm going to get her to do comedy with me.  It's just unbelievable.  Is the banging way down already?  Oh, it's unbelievable.  That's not true.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, with us it is.  I still bang, but sometimes you're not in the room.  She's so fucking dizzy.  We were in the hotel the other night. 
[04:26:00]  She's so what?  Fucking dizzy.  What do you think I said?  Rich, dizzy.  Yeah, I have an inner ear infection and I literally am dizzy.  Oh, all right.  That's fine.  That was a fucking 40s expression.  I know.  What a dizzy dame she is.  You know what else he always says?  Dizzy broad?  I hipped you to Diet Coke, didn't I?  He thinks he hipped me to everything.  Hipped you to it.  Stop taking your Lenny Bruce character so seriously.  Listen to me.  We're fucking in.  And I'm dizzy broad. 
[04:26:30]  I hipped her to.  I took her.  I mean, we were in a hotel the other night.  Go on, Daddy.  So the smoke alarm.  The smoke alarm's going off.  She goes, can you press the button?  I go, your cigarette.  She goes, your cigarette is making a smoke alarm.  And next to her on the bed, the little dresser, there's a fucking towel on fire from her candle.  She's sitting there reading.  And there's a fucking towel on fire.  She's going, you got to put your cigarette out. 
[04:27:00]  No, but like it was still five.  What were you, bedrock?  Fucking lights.  I mean, you use a light.  But you do have to.  Because I light a smelly candle because of the cigarette smoke.  Yeah, stop smoking.  Why don't you stop?  Oh, my God, Rich.  Somehow get it.  We're not going to your funeral if you die of lung cancer.  Why don't you stop?  Well, I didn't think you would.  You didn't go to the wedding.  Why would you go to the funeral?  Imagine that.  Oh, I can't make it that night.  Oh, Rich.  Finally, Patrice and Billy Burt bring a present. 
[04:27:30]  He smashed us.  You're taking that hard stuff.  No, no, I'm not.  We all explained ourselves on our past show.  I let it go.  So, dude, why don't you quit smoking?  I am.  I'm going to go to a hypnotist.  I just got the link for it.  I just got the link for a hypnotist.  No, no, not a hypnotist.  What kind of bullshit answer is that?  Not a hypnotist.  A fucking laser.  You can get laser surgery.  That's a really big difference.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait.  What?  Laser?  Yeah.  To quit smoking?  Yeah, yeah.  What do they do?  Unless they weld your mouth shut. 
[04:28:00]  No, I don't know.  What the fuck do they do?  What do they do with a laser?  I think they actually laser a part of your brain, don't they?  No.  They can't fuck my brain up anymore.  They cannot laser a part of your brain.  Yeah, just someone like Nicholson at the end of Cuckoo's Nest.  In Staten Island, some lady I met said she got laser.  There is no surgery.  She was wearing a toga.  I got the link.  Let me tell you something.  We will look at the link.  Give it to Iraq.  He will punch it up.  I will guarantee you, there is no way they touch your brain with a laser to make you 
[04:28:30]  stop smoking.  They do something, maybe googly your eyes or something, or it sounds like a scam to me.  Rich is trying to find a way to quit smoking that's not going to hurt.  Zero pain.  Stop it.  Esty took me down for the patch.  I love to fucking smoke.  You smoke more than I do, but I smoked for 17 years.  Jimmy liked to smoke.  Anthony, one day I was going to quit.  I said, I'm going to finish this pack, and Anthony was just fucking put the cigarettes 
[04:29:00]  down.  I said, I'm having one more.  I had one more.  It was a Friday.  I went down to the cellar.  Esty marched me over.  Got me the patch.  Just marched?  We marched.  Was he leading you with an SS patch on his fucking shoulders?  Which fucking ate off?  Yes.  We marched.  Yeah.  He cleans out the apartment complex.  The patch had a swastik on it.  Yes.  Lovely red patch on my...  Why are you still going for bargains?  Why don't you just go to a reputable guy and get it done?  He wants to do it without pain. 
[04:29:30]  Rich wants to quit without the fucking emotions.  You're going to cry a lot.  I've been crying for five years since I quit.  It's all I did.  I don't understand that the guy is an addict.  You have overcome booze and drugs.  And gambling.  So you know that the only way to really stop, there was no patch for crack.  There's no fucking laser for booze.  I think that was all lies.  You've got to just stop.  Yeah.  I think that's all bullshit.  I almost stole Rich's joke in front of him or Bonnie's joke in front of Rich. 
[04:30:00]  That it's all bullshit.  No, who once said that Rich only did drugs as an excuse for blowing guys?  Is that you?  It was.  I just thought of that and I realized that's not yours.  I said I quit just for the applause break on stage.  Yeah.  That's funny.  That's good.  That's not what I was quoting.  No, but that's another joke I threw in there.  Oh, of course.  But see, you do what I say that you always do.  What?  You try to steal the laughter from whoever got the last laugh.  Yes.  Yes, he does.  You're saying what Rich does is Rich was piggybacking that moment and trying to be the last one to speak so it looked like his moment. 
[04:30:30]  It's called tagging.  It's called tagging.  You didn't tag it.  You didn't tag it.  That's not a tag.  That's a whole new little story that you brought up.  Yep.  Oh, look.  This is comfortable all of a sudden everywhere she goes now.  She's on stage now.  This is a fucking broad.  I was reading a piece of paper in L.A. off a stool.  Now she's on stage with her foot in the front table fucking leaning into the mic and working the crowd.  Okay, and every now and then one of my fucking lines comes in and goes, hey, you know, you got so many of them, but she's getting too confident. 
[04:31:00]  And that's the problem.  I'm going to have to bring you to the stress factory again to fucking humble you.  I don't give the same love as I used to.  Wow.  Remember when they first hooked up?  It was just about love.  When we first hooked up, it was.  It's kind of a drop off here, just a bit.  Wow.  And golly over here.  He's getting a little scared of his position, I think.  I also hear a lot of avoidance about the smoking question.  Okay, Dr. Phil.  That's right.  Dana Reeves just died. 
[04:31:30]  Absolutely.  She didn't smoke.  She didn't smoke.  She had the secondhand smoke, they're saying, or something.  The secondhand smoke or something?  Was his wheelchair a locomotive?  The guy who was smoking near her.  He had little kids and an invalid.  From being a, uh, she was like one of those, uh, torch singers.  Oh, so she was in a lot of clubs?  That's what they were saying.  With the smoke.  I had a little info on that.  All right.  Very good.  I'm glad you did.  I know it sounds stupid, but, uh, she was a singer in the lounges.  All right.  Back in her day. 
[04:32:00]  And they're saying maybe it was the secondhand smoke from way back when.  I don't think that.  I think that whole secondhand smoke is bullshit.  Why don't you just quit?  What are you so scared of?  Uh, because you have fucking kids, you want to see graduate college.  Why don't you stop?  My kids aren't going to college.  Oh, okay.  They keep smoking.  You have kids that you're going to have to drop off at the bottom.  Hey, were you?  At the Regal Beagle.  Were you in Sacramento?  Yes.  Last week?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Richard.  Get an update. 
[04:32:30]  A review.  Yeah.  A review.  Excuse me.  I was in Sac over the weekend on Sunday.  Oh, you were there on Sunday?  Yeah.  I couldn't believe you smoked on stage.  That was awesome.  Was that?  Oh, yeah.  Because you're not allowed to smoke in a club.  You rebel.  You're not allowed to smoke within like 10 feet of a building in Sacramento.  Yeah.  That was awesome.  Born and killed, too.  Yeah.  We did.  I did.  It was a good show, huh, Richard?  Oh, real good.  Yeah, right on.  Cool.  Yeah, it was great.  He tore a couple audience members up.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  I mean, Richard, uh, Richard, Richard, Richard, uh, Vossier gets a bad rep sometimes. 
[04:33:00]  We like to kill him on the show, but it takes a lot of heat on the show, but very funny  when you see him live on the stage.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Now, the bottom line is, Voss, you've been lying about quitting for years.  Listen, we're talking about my fucking stage performance, and all of a sudden you've got  the guy brought up smoking on stage is what happened.  Said he was, uh, yeah, so Richard killed, and he was smoking.  You'll be talking, you've been quitting, I'm gonna quit on my birthday, I'm gonna quit  on my anniversary, I'm gonna quit this, and every one of them passes.  I'm sure we got tapes from N.E.W. of him saying he's gonna quit soon. 
[04:33:30]  Yeah.  That was years ago now, Rich.  You can't fly and smoke in the airport.  It's awful.  I smoke in the airport.  It's in the bathroom.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you stop?  Why don't you get so scared of?  Just stop.  I'm not scared.  Well, I am scared, but, you know.  What else do I have?  What do you do on the flights?  You're not gonna lose a piece of your deal.  I do nicotine gum.  New York to L.A., what do you do?  Well, he complains a lot, number one.  Nicotine gum.  And I sleep a lot.  You're not gonna, you're afraid, Richard, you're afraid, A, of being uncomfortable, and  B, like, you're gonna lose a piece of who you are. 
[04:34:00]  You're not gonna lose a part of yourself.  Okay, here's the deal.  I'll make a deal with you.  We'll pick a date, and I quit smoking, and you quit deviant sexual behaviors.  I've already quit smoking, and when-  Whoa, whoa, whoa, I quit camera.  Hold on.  When deviant sexual behaviors put a tumor on my jaw, I'll quit doing those.  Yeah, what about a fucking lesion on your face?  Not my problem.  I'll just pass it along.  No, see how easy it is?  What are you so scared of?  I've already quit smoking.  I've already quit gambling. 
[04:34:30]  I quit drugs.  I'm talking about an immediate health risk that's gonna fucking kill you, dude.  Some of Jimmy's girls have looked like tumors on his jaw.  I know what you're saying, dude, but I'm not being holier than thou.  I'm not saying quit addictive behavior because it's naughty.  I'm saying smoking is an immediate awful health risk.  I'm not making a moral judgment.  I'm saying it's a fucking horrible risk, and I've quit.  I know how awful it is.  And I'm not being self-righteous.  At least you get the AIDS.  You know, you got ten good years.  Absolutely.  And you could fucking always just pretend you got it from a needle or, you know, blood transfusion. 
[04:35:00]  I got sick ones.  And you will look thin at some point.  And you could eat all you want, right, because you're gonna lose the weight eventually.  And I haven't...  And my sexual addiction, I'm not running into a bathroom in the airport anymore.  And again...  That's because they clogged up all the holes in the dividers.  It does look, though, Jim, like you purposely try to find women who may have something wrong with them.  I'm not saying...  Look, I'm not saying that an uncle 15 years ago doesn't help my cause, because it does. 
[04:35:30]  The worse your family, the better it is for me.  But 15 years ago, you knew better.  Well, yeah, maybe more than 15.  Not the girls I'm dating.  Your uncle touched you when you were 21, 22?  No, one.  That's what I'm saying, 15 years ago.  Your uncle didn't touch you.  There's nobody that desperate in your family.  Why don't you quit smoking?  I'm good.  Here's the game plan.  Oh, boy.  All right?  Okay, I'll make a deal with it.  There's a plan now.  That's good. 
[04:36:00]  June 30th on my birthday.  Oh, stop.  One of the first things you said to me when we started dating was that you were gonna quit  smoking June 30th on your birthday.  And June 30th came and went without incident.  You didn't even bring it up.  I was already bagging you, so what the fuck?  I already closed the deal.  I had to come up with a new lie.  And his sober date.  He was gonna quit on his sober date.  I've heard that one.  I've heard I'm gonna quit after the holidays, after the stress. 
[04:36:30]  There's never a good day to do it.  Yeah, you just have to trick yourself.  You just have to one day just go put your cigarettes down.  And realize it's gonna hurt a little bit.  If I still obsessed, I'd be smoking again.  You think I could go this long obsessing?  How long did you quit?  December will be five years.  No.  Or four years.  Wait.  December of 2001.  It'll be five years in December.  Yeah, I remember when that was.  It was when we were doing the What Have You Got segment of the show.  I had a moment about it.  What the hell is that?  Oh, yeah.  The guy brought the login?  It was What the hell is that?  No, the guy was, we had a couple of doctors in the studio, and we had guests come in. 
[04:37:00]  Hey, Colin.  Hey, Colin.  I was actually.  Take his seat.  Colin Quinn just ripped the boss out of his seat.  Took his headphones.  You were raped.  Oh, man.  That's the most exercise he's done in a month.  Colin, you picked the perfect day to stop by.  You picked the perfect day to stop by.  Get in on this. 
[04:37:30]  I fucking.  Boss is telling us he's going to quit smoking again.  But as Colin walked in, I was thinking about Colin.  That's fucking really creepy.  That's great.  Here's the psychic.  Is that a awful bandage on your nose?  That's from one of the girls he's dating.  Let's get Colin Quinn and Mike.  We need a chair for him.  Surprise.  Oh, what is that?  Colin shouldn't ask his dad.  I'm expecting Bud Fox to save you.  Nothing?  No, that's not bad.  LA Confidential?  Hey!  Come on!  You can see. 
[04:38:00]  Just threw his breakfast on the floor.  The reason I came by, by the way.  Okay.  Are we going to have an intervention or something?  Something.  The reason I came by.  No, it's an intervention for you two guys.  Oh, what do we do?  A little power corrupt.  Power corrupts.  Apparently, from giving this idiot a voice on the radio, he drove me home last night.  His Toyota Caddy.  Have you seen that?  His family that he calls it Caddy?  It's the worst Cadillac ever. 
[04:38:30]  It looks like a Camry.  So he's got the most awful GPS that's like, you know, it's crayons.  It's an eight-year-old girl.  And then, uh...  And then, uh...  So last night, we're driving home.  This moron.  I thought I had something.  It goes to me.  Uh, you know, uh...  I don't believe much in conspiracy.  He always has to deny that he believes in everything, and then he believes in it.  So he can feel like he's a unique guy instead of just another, uh, you know, strip-all idiot like the rest of us. 
[04:39:00]  And he's like, oh, I'm not a conspiracy guy like some of these idiots.  And then he goes into this thing about the wing nuts.  We heard about it, yeah.  It was just so aggravating.  I felt like saying, you know, either do charity or learn a musical instrument.  You're a fucking phony bore.  It's so boring.  You're a shithead.  I mean, if you saw these photos, he goes, give me a...  I'm not giving you my fucking emails.  You can wait.  Send me some shitty pictures.  Go back to porn. 
[04:39:30]  At least then you were kind of excited.  What a phony.  Instead of reading a book or taking a class, this is what dumb people do to feel intellectual.  They check out, like, the size of planes.  Go, I mean, if you look at the vector, there's some other shit.  Because some other asshole sent it to him.  We go, you know, this is not a 757.  Yes, it probably is.  But who gives a shit?  You boring idiot.  It was actually...  Take that thing off.  Is that a sleep apnea thing?  What else could it be?  Colin, you're on fire.  Don't sit down.  I'm not going to sit down.  He's working the room. 
[04:40:00]  He's pacing back and forth and just doing some crowd work.  Are you going to get 2% reduced?  I don't think you're fat because you don't have to, you know.  Oh, my God.  We all do that, though.  We'll read all those political books and then just reciting what we just read to all the people.  But I was honest about where I got it.  I didn't say I made it up.  I said that I found a credible source.  The gravitas in his fucking idiotic face is what got to me.  He put the pressure on me, though, now, to dispute this.  But you'll watch it.  He goes, I'll send you the link.  Watch it.  And then you tell me where the piece came from that is in the 757.  That's right.  Oh, tell him to prove it. 
[04:40:30]  Then you dispute it.  And then I go, well, what's the motive?  I don't know.  But...  Well, that would be part one of this argument.  But I don't know.  Tell me the motive.  Then don't bring it up until you have a motive.  Well, I don't have to have a solution.  No, a motive is different from a solution, you.  Yes, it is.  That's a motive.  It's a solution as to why it happened.  Why would the government shove a plane into the Pentagon?  I don't know if they would.  Because they were waiting for the right opportunity.  So that day when two planes went into the World Trade Center, they said, now's our chance.  Quick.  Because the ones that went into the Trade Center are legit.  It's that Pentagon one. 
[04:41:00]  Yeah.  They just had it sitting there waiting for that to happen.  He raised some good points, and I had to say he raised some good points.  And you raised no good points.  I didn't say I did.  Beat it.  I really felt good to play.  There are bars in town.  I saw them last night.  Bring them in.  I can call it.  Beat it.  Beat it.  Well, we were talking about Rich Voss and his dumb smoking.  He's got to stop smoking.  Yeah, why don't you stop, stupid?  I smoke three packs a day and I quit.  When do you quit?  15 years.  Spend one packs a day. 
[04:41:30]  But he won't tell us why he won't quit.  He keeps making excuses.  I'll tell you what, he's afraid.  And setting dates when he might quit.  You want to know why he won't quit?  Because I fucking smoke.  We all smoked.  Jim smoked.  He quit.  Because you're afraid to deal with the sadness and the fear and the anger that's going to  come out when you quit smoking.  You don't have something to hide behind.  First of all, I deal with anger and fear on a daily basis.  Yeah, by lighting up five packs a day.  I know.  And the fetal position.  Oh, no.  Some use the misandering position. 
[04:42:00]  He's the fetal.  Do you know that fire that you were talking about in the hotel room?  Yeah.  Is directly because of your smoking, not because of her candle?  She lit a candle to stop the smoke.  That's right.  No, she was reading tarot cards.  No, that's not true.  If she was reading tarot cards, she's as crazy as you are.  She needs some more.  Were you reading tarot cards?  Were you reading tarot cards by candlelight?  No, I get a, you know, a scented candle.  Oh, my God.  And it's just for the...  Yeah, because it's nice.  And it's just for the smoke, right? 
[04:42:30]  Yeah, it's for the smoke.  I'm going to wait for myself because no one will rip it apart.  Do you make him open up the anti-suicide windows like that fraction of an inch?  Last night I was there.  Yeah, you were there puffing out there.  It doesn't work.  Blows it right back into the room.  One night I look over.  He's in bed with a cigarette asleep.  Oh, that's never resulted in thousands of deaths.  Did you ever see his old apartment on the fucking floor?  It looked like little black snail trails because this fucking lazy Jew kept falling asleep  with cigarettes in his hand and dropping them on the floor. 
[04:43:00]  He's not going to die from lung cancer.  He's not going to...  He's just going to burn up.  He's going to take a bunch of people with him.  He's fucking...  He's sanding something and putting varnish on it and he falls asleep and fucking kills  everyone in the house.  What's Little Richie afraid of when he takes the cigarette away and there's no barriers  between him and the world?  That's right.  What is...  I'd like to know, too.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just, you know, it's...  No, no, just, you know.  I'm not afraid of anything.  What is Little Richie...  You are.  It's addiction and, you know...  Right, but what does addiction come from?  Pile of ashes, gold chain and teeth.  What's it come from?  It comes from... 
[04:43:30]  You feel comfortable sitting there with something blocking, a big wave of smoke blocking you, not only from  the world, but from your alleged...  Absolutely.  Well, she's reading Tarot.  She's reading the Tarot card by Canada Life.  And tea leaves.  Yeah, she's got to eat tea leaves.  It's the modern day knitting when a husband's not really...  Yeah, these two are coming up with hobbies so they don't have to hang out with each other.  How quickly did this fall apart?  This is the shortest marriage. 
[04:44:00]  I want to fucking know what exactly...  Like, you are...  Like, everyone hides.  You hide your fear behind fucking cigarettes.  Other people hide certain failures behind a lot of food the last year and a half.  Can I...  I knew it was coming.  I know.  Can I theorize something?  Great telegraph acting technique.  It's really coming here.  Jesus Christ.  Can't wait to see Lucky Lou here.  We call it King of Queens with cursing.  Perhaps, Rich, when you started smoking, whatever it was, 20-some years ago... 
[04:44:30]  When...  How long was it?  20.  Okay, so a long time ago.  30-something years ago.  31.  You needed the cigarettes because of your, whatever, your fear, your unhappiness.  And now you're addicted, but maybe you don't need the cigarettes anymore.  You have a lovely bride.  Maybe you're better.  You should be happier now.  I'm very happy.  I got a lot...  Look what you scored, bro.  I'll tell you what it is.  Yeah, he did score big.  The problem is, you still want to think I'm Rich Voss, a teenage rebel, or an old man 
[04:45:00]  a few years away from Boca.  Just admit it, and get rid of the scars, and walk around.  Your new edition could be complaining about your ills.  Old Jews don't smoke.  What's the matter with you?  I hipped you to Jews.  You leave my stuff alone, Norris.  I won't touch your stuff, but you've got to stop smoking.  I'm going to.  I really know you.  Set a date.  Just set a date.  Set a date?  Not set a date.  But don't do it for us.  You do it now. 
[04:45:30]  You don't set a date.  How many times do I say I want to quit smoking?  You don't set a date.  You know what you do?  You take the pack.  Where's your pack?  Huh?  Here's how you do it.  Where's your pack?  It's out in the car.  You know what...  Anthony goes for the old school Ron Conkoma style.  Give me the pack.  In Anthony's families, you just see one of the uncles come out in the Bermuda shorts  with the sandals.  Give me the pack.  He's smoking.  Give me your cigarettes.  Give me the pack.  Give me the quit.  There you are.  Done.  But that was how he helped me quit. 
[04:46:00]  He fucking...  Anthony helped me quit by the same disgust to just fucking throw the pack out.  You immediately throw it away.  And I did.  I had one more and that was just for me.  Yeah, because it's water or one of these people, remember?  No, I don't.  It was the guy with the thing on his lip jaw.  We were playing.  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that?  We have doctors in the studio.  Let's do that again.  People would come up and get free examinations for whatever they got.  Something on their legs.  Something on their...  And this one guy had a bump on his gum line.  So the doctor put the glove on and he's feeling it.  He goes, that's a hard lump. 
[04:46:30]  That's not good.  He goes, you have this checked out immediately.  He goes, you smoke?  And the guy's like, yeah.  And the guy's...  And then we start talking about how he's going to look.  With half a jaw.  Well, the fear on that guy is like, oh God, just tell me what it is.  Tell me what it is.  I mean, it was supposed to be a fun bit and turn it to...  Jimmy quit.  That guy...  It was horrific.  And one doctor, just to add to this, punched out.  He's like, I don't want to be part of this.  Wow.  He saw what was in that guy's mouth and said, I'm done.  I don't want to be part of this.  The guy turned out to not have...  Right.  We found out a month later.  But when he was trying to go, the guy was like saying, all right, where should I go? 
[04:47:00]  What should I do?  And watching him try to hang on to his sanity, I'm like, that is exactly what it looks  like when you find out you have mouth cancer.  Yeah.  He's like, that is exactly a moment.  Because the guy was trying to not panic, and that's what's freaking me out.  But it was panicking him.  Okay, where do I go?  What should I do?  Who should I go to check this out?  And just...  Yeah.  You know, I want the best guy.  I'll never forget that.  You ever stop smoking for a limited time because maybe you had something, you didn't know what  it was, and you're like, uh-oh.  Uh-uh.  Nothing like that. 
[04:47:30]  No.  No?  No, no.  I spoke nonstop.  You did quit for six months.  You did quit for six months.  I quit for six months.  Why?  What spurred that?  Uh, I was working in Boston, and I went and saw the Mad Russian.  There was a guy up in Boston that...  I went to that guy that didn't work for me.  You want to see...  Huh?  No.  He's just a douche.  He doesn't work for anybody.  No, he doesn't work for a lot.  Shut up.  I went six months.  What's the Mad Russian?  He was some...  Some fucking flake.  You call me a flake for conspiracy theories?  Some fucking commie?  Now I need to throw my Aussie doll on the milk. 
[04:48:00]  Anything we think somebody might love has to be destroyed.  That's right.  He broke my trophy on his dumb show.  That's right.  Holy shit.  His fucking Aussie doll.  There's a little Aussie thing that Stalker Patty gave me, and he just ripped it up and  boss...  Oh.  Oh.  Things are going bad. 
[04:48:30]  She's the only person that emails me consistently.  Who is the Mad Russian?  So, Colin, when's your show on so I can be on again?  The Mad Russian is this fucking flaky douche in Boston, and you sit there, and he does  an energy thing over you, and supposedly makes you quit.  Jesus.  And I'm an asshole for thinking that fucking...  It worked for me.  Why did you go?  It wasn't really 21 years.  How about this?  Fuck your aunt.  She was ready to quit.  Yeah, well, if you're ready to quit, maybe that's a help.  I'm really impressed.  That's a help.  Fuck your aunt.  You should do everything you can do. 
[04:49:00]  I mean, you should...  What?  Yeah, get a patch, get hypnotized, do all of it.  Do you like the smoking, Bonnie?  Everything.  I love it.  I don't want him to quit.  Subconsciously wants him to die.  What'd you do?  Would you do it with Bonnie?  You didn't even accuse him of that, because you know he has no money.  It's really not fun to be around somebody who's quitting smoking, and I'm not looking  for it.  How fun is he now?  Much fun to quit.  Did you ever smoke, Bonnie?  Ever?  Yes, I did.  You did?  It took me many tries to quit.  And you quit?  Yeah, so four years.  How long ago?  Four years. 
[04:49:30]  You miss it?  Actually, at one point before I started dating Rich, I thought I might actually start again.  It's very rough when you hook up with a smoker and you've quit for a while because you just  pick it right back up again.  Well, she drinks and gets high every now and then, so that was hard, too, you know.  Stop trying to even it up.  Maybe you can handle booze now.  No, I can't handle booze.  One of me and you go to a smoker.  I know a smoker's thing next week.  Next Sunday we'll go.  I'll go with you.  To a smoker's thing?  Yeah, like a smoker's meeting. 
[04:50:00]  Next Sunday?  Yeah, Sunday night.  You're not working.  Stop acting like you are.  Wait, what's Sunday?  This Sunday?  Sunday coming up.  Yeah, I'll be out of town.  He doesn't even know where Sunday is anymore.  I'll be out of town.  Sunday.  Sunday what?  Between Sunday and Monday, no good.  No good.  And Colin, as much as after that Aussie doll thing, how I really don't want to admit this,  helped me more than anybody.  The thing he said to me, which I don't think he made up, but he said to me, the urge to  smoke will pass whether you smoke or not.  And that was as perfectly simplistic. 
[04:50:30]  Well, it's the same as drinking and getting up.  Shut up.  Stop trying to act like you, too, understand this.  You're still smoking, kiddie.  Rick loves to be the expert on addiction.  He'll just jump in.  Oh, please.  Listen, just what you got.  Look at Barney.  Guess what?  Every guy's like that.  No matter who you married, you'd be miserable every time they open their mouth.  Voss, are you going to the Freedom Center?  What the fuck is the Freedom Center?  That's the laser therapy thing. 
[04:51:00]  First of all, when somebody goes, what the fuck?  You're not doing it.  Huh?  It's Staten Island.  Welcome to Freedom Laser Therapy.  What is lasers do to make you stop smoking?  Freedom from smoking addiction?  It's Staten Island.  I don't know.  They'd probably make a good cigarette lighter.  He's done no research.  Light it up with a laser?  He's done no research on it.  None.  Someone said laser.  Someone said it to him.  Dummy thought technology.  It's easy.  It's the future.  No problem.  They'll take out that little cell that makes me smoke.  Oh, stupid.  You think they're going to do some kind of brain thing?  I told you about it.  What's their, what's the gimmick here? 
[04:51:30]  They don't really explain.  Oh, good.  It's vague.  It's lasers and it's vague.  Low-level laser therapy.  Hold on.  I think I have it.  You don't have to wear contacts anymore.  They use some kind of Jedi mind shit on you.  You don't need that cigarette anymore.  You have no need to smoke.  You'll feel great.  It's Sunday when you get back in town.  We'll go to a place.  Here we go.  Here we go.  We got Tyler and Columbus.  Tyler for Rich Voss.  Hey.  Hey, uh, yeah, I got, you guys were just talking about that guy that, uh, had the big lump 
[04:52:00]  in his mouth, uh, from years ago.  Yeah.  My father-in-law, uh, got the big casino in his jaw and, uh, about a month ago he just  had it removed.  Um, he's, uh, about, what are you boss, about, uh, in your forties?  Yeah.  Good call.  He's 85.  What did he have?  The big what?  His cancer.  The big casino.  Oh, I thought he had like Caesars or Boundaries.  No, he's, uh, actually had cancer in his mouth twice now.  No headphones?  And, uh.  For Rich?  For Rich.  For Colin.  Why would there be headphones for somebody that's in studio with us? 
[04:52:30]  Look.  Why?  Why?  Why would we have that?  Colin actually took a toilet paper tube to his ear and he put it to Rich's head.  It's a great photo of him.  He's hearing the C.  Wait.  That's wacky.  That's wacky.  Wait.  So, he had, uh, he had his whole jaw removed, not the tumor?  Uh, yeah.  They had to take his, uh, the cancer spread through actually the bone in his jaw.  There you go.  There you go.  Ah, I'd look forward to some of that, maybe.  And the inactuitive veins and everything in his jaw and they had to remove the whole damn  thing and rebuild it. 
[04:53:00]  They took, like, hip from, or bone from his hip and skin from his chest and legs and made  him a new jaw, but he's all.  Oh.  Hey, boss, stop it.  Dude, this guy's telling, this guy right now.  This is just a million of these stories if I'm not fucking ready.  Yeah, by the way, caller, you know what?  During your story, Rich was checking his bookings on his Palm Pilot thing.  No, I was trying to find the quit smoking thing right here and I found the, uh, the, uh, link,  the website or whatever.  No, I mean, people, yeah.  Right next to the link to buy cigarettes online. 
[04:53:30]  People quit smoking and all that, you know, all that shit, but it's like, uh, you know,  when you see it, like, I'm sitting across the room from the guy and it's like, tongues,  his dead tongue, his tongue died.  They had to remove that too.  So, like, 80%.  That wouldn't be so bad.  All right, there's an upside to the whole thing.  But wait a second.  From, was that from smoking?  Yeah, it was from smoking.  Or chewing tobacco?  No, he didn't chew.  They said he got the cancer from, uh, uh, they told him he was going to cancer his mouth  from smoking.  Find another way to justify it.  Yeah, filterless? 
[04:54:00]  Yeah.  That doll?  Yeah.  One hundreds.  Is he a Christian?  Plus, it's not going to help those tombstones you call teeth, you know, they're turning gray  from smoking.  All right, Tyler.  All right.  I'm going to, here's what I'm going to do.  I'm sorry you didn't get the reaction you were looking for.  Yeah.  No, he's got a point, which is, Voss has to have the guts to go to a cancer war.  We've had to get a car crash, so it's all good.  No, you're fine.  Thanks.  All right.  You know what I'm going to do?  April 22nd.  Why April?  That's a good idea.  Why are you picking a date? 
[04:54:30]  He's supposed to pick a date.  Is that it?  I've done all that stuff.  I just quit.  I once was just like Rich Voss.  Really?  I tried it all.  The mad Russian.  All of them.  Well, here's where Rich is going.  Oh, the laser thing?  Now, what do they do?  It's a therapy you can't even pronounce.  Oriculoral therapy.  Oricul.  It's the one word he can't pronounce.  Is it something like ocular?  A-U-R.  It's natural.  A-U-R.  A-U-R.  What do they go through?  Your ear?  I-C-U-L-O therapy. 
[04:55:00]  Oricula.  Oricula.  All right.  There you go.  Wait a minute.  If this involves your fucking ear.  Here we go.  What is it?  It's a non-invasive form of acupuncture.  No needles.  It utilizes a minor electrical impulse to stimulate acupuncture points in the outer ear.  I did that one, too.  I did that one, too.  It didn't work.  Really?  Don't be asked.  Why do you think a laser beam in your ear is going to stop you from smoking?  It might stop the zis that are on the back of my ear.  Yeah.  It's going to start boiling the cyst and the doctor's going to drop dead.  I'm surprised you could get the lights out. 
[04:55:30]  I thought the, you know, the wetness would put your cigarettes out immediately.  I know.  It's a mouth.  This technique's been used for pain, addictions, and a host of many other dysfunctions.  I did it.  It didn't work.  It didn't work.  How can you tell it?  It's new.  I did it.  They didn't have it back then.  It's new.  I did it.  It's called his new family.  He did it when it was the acupuncture.  You know how stupid Voss is?  Because it says around the website that they've been doing this since 500 B.C. in China.  I haven't checked the website out yet. 
[04:56:00]  It's new.  Like gunpowder.  What are you, a pterodactyl shit?  Your act may be, but...  They invented the wheel and then this technique the next day.  But it's new to Voss.  The newest thing since the stone tool.  Fucking Voss.  I haven't actually gone to the website yet.  It's not new.  Forget about it.  It's like there, 500 B.C. in China. 
[04:56:30]  I hip to the acupuncture.  One time I went to get like acupuncture, Norm MacDonald goes, you know, that's great stuff  because I was injured.  He goes, they've used that for millions of years in China.  I go, yeah.  He goes, yeah, then they invented medicine.  So they didn't have to use it.  You guys are always on the TV quote each other?  What?  I was pretty excited.  I wish I had a cut.  I don't want to use the car crash.  I want a clip of him lighting up.
