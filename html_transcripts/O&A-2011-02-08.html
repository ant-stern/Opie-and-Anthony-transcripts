<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in their characteristically outrageous and offensive banter, referencing past FCC run-ins.  They satirize CNN's news coverage, contrasting its shift from serious news (the Egyptian revolution) to sensationalist stories (car crashes, teen sexting), and spend considerable time mocking photoshopped images of Anderson Cooper wearing a bread helmet.  The discussion then pivots to the upcoming appearance of William H. Macy and *Shameless*, specifically praising Emily Rossum's attractiveness, before complaining about their dilapidated studio and the lack of preparedness for an upcoming Showtime filming.

The hosts delve into a detailed discussion of the upcoming Fedor vs. Bigfoot fight, providing graphic descriptions of Bigfoot's appearance and Fedor's fighting style, even fantasizing about Jim Norton being subjected to one of Fedor's signature holds.  A news story about a wrestler with strep throat inexplicably triggers a lengthy conversation about herpes, featuring numerous caller accounts detailing outbreak locations, treatment methods (Valtrex, Lysine), and the awkwardness of buying medication.  The show ends this segment with commentary on the Super Bowl's viewership, Christina Aguilera's controversial National Anthem performance, a Valentine's Day candy heart reading "You Cunt," and a brief mention of Vince Neil's 50th birthday.

The show continues with a discussion spurred by a Valentine's Day candy with the word "tits," prompting listener concerns about children.  This leads to a conversation about small, high-definition pocket cameras, with specific brands and features mentioned, including references to B&H Photo Video.  A news story about a grocery store clerk contaminating yogurt samples with semen and saliva is then recounted in detail.  The "Bread Helmet Guy" meme resurfaces, with further photoshopping suggestions and ideas for a segment involving pigeons.  This segment concludes with a review of a video showing Jim Norton experiencing various UFC submission holds (guillotine choke by Cain Velasquez, armbar by BJ Penn, choke by Randy Couture), planning future holds with Frank Shamrock and Fedor Emelianenko, and soliciting listener suggestions (omoplata, anaconda choke, knee bar, Darce choke). Bob Kelly enters the studio towards the end of this segment.

A major portion of the show then focuses on professional wrestling, specifically Vince McMahon's return to WWE and WrestleMania's guest host announcement.  In-studio guest Sam Roberts, a wrestling enthusiast, contributes to the speculation on McMahon's absence and wrestling storylines.  Chris Jericho's comments on MMA and Brock Lesnar's potential WrestleMania involvement are also discussed, along with WrestleMania viewing figures compared to the Super Bowl.  A video of a young boy reviewing Yankee Candles is played, generating sexually suggestive and homophobic commentary from the hosts.

The final and longest segment features an in-studio interview with Fedor Emelianenko and Frank Shamrock, along with Bob Kelly, conducted with a translator.  The interview, marked by comedic miscommunication, covers Emelianenko's recent loss, training, and future fights, including playful requests for him to "punish" staff members.  Frank Shamrock discusses his career and strained relationship with his brother, Ken.  The interview includes Fedor demonstrating a submission hold on Jim Norton and Frank Shamrock briefly demonstrating a hold on Bob Kelly.

A further segment features another interview with Fedor Emelianenko and Frank Shamrock, discussing Emelianenko's weight class, promotion of upcoming Strikeforce events (open workout, weigh-in, Grand Prix quarterfinals), and attempts at simple Russian phrases.  Emelianenko reveals his free time is spent with family and reading.  Frank Shamrock discusses his career, business ventures, family life, and the challenges of commentating on fighters he knows.  His extensive dental work is also a topic.  The segment then shifts to a video of a man's emotional reaction to a library closing, followed by a discussion of Stephen King novels ("Misery," "Gerald's Game").  The show concludes with plugs for comedy shows and a recap of the day's events, including the physical interactions with the MMA fighters (and Showtime's recording of these interactions).


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go, here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit, this is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love, that's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and they've even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Exciting.  Yeah, I think we got our first few minutes of radio.  We're getting ready to do the radio show.  We look at the TV.  It's CNN, too, right?  CNN, yes. 
[00:01:30]  Your news source.  Your big news source.  Your news source.  The home of our new friend, Piers Morgan.  Right.  And we look, and they were teasing a head-on collision story.  A driver driving the wrong way on a major highway.  It looks like it's out west somewhere.  And we watched it, and it looks like somebody in the proper lane is recording somebody that  is in the improper side of the road driving against traffic.  Yeah.  And we're watching, going, oh, here it goes, here it goes.  And then they cut away and go, you know, they'll be back with more of that. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, they're going to be back with that and the story on teen sexting.  Teen sexting.  So I guess the Egypt thing is all taken care of, which is good.  That right there tells you.  I want to congratulate the Egyptians for getting that job done.  And they've got a brand new government, and they're all making well over $50,000 a year now.  So that situation is taken care of, and we're back to what really matters, head-on collisions  and teen sexting.  And teen sexting.  The news stinks.  We are, it's just hysterical. 
[00:02:30]  I want to congratulate Hosni Mubarak for retaining his office because it's out of the news now.  And now he's going to just crack some skulls.  See, this is the problem with the news.  It's their job, not our job.  We're a dumb radio show.  We'll talk about a little of everything.  But it's their job, if there's a major story going on, to hang in there.  Right.  But they don't have the patience because there's other things to talk about.  No, we don't have the patience either as a public.  Yeah, but it's not our job.  We're not a news source.  But their job now isn't to do the news. 
[00:03:00]  Their job is to entertain us.  True.  So they knew we were getting a little bored.  The Egypt thing comes on, and we're like, well, nothing new.  Let's change the channel.  So now they're like, all right, pop in some teen sexting.  True.  And we need some car wrecks.  Yeah, but the dumb point I'm making is then they should call themselves an entertainment show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  See, they still go under the moniker that they're the news.  If you're the news, then you've got to keep Anderson Cooper there, even though he's getting  fucking popped in the face and rocks to the head. 
[00:03:30]  And you hang in there until it's over.  If Anderson Cooper was smart, he'd put bread on his head, and that would solve his problem.  See, he's just not savvy.  Are you obsessed with bread helmet, man?  I cannot get enough of bread head.  I just call him bread head.  Bread head.  I saw you were photoshopping him all afternoon, and then I saw a few photoshops that were pretty  funny.  The latest one I saw was him as Elias on the cover of the Platoon movie poster, where Elias 
[00:04:00]  has his hands on the air and getting shot by the church.  That's a good one.  Yeah, just put in a bread helmet.  Bread helmet is the new, he's the new internet sensation picture.  Obviously, yesterday, one of the guys in that square that I can't pronounce, Tahrir, Tahrir,  Tahrir, Tahrir, Tahrir, Tahrir, Tahrir, Tahrir, Tahrir, Tahrir, Tahrir, Tahrir.  You know, when you've got the rocks flying, you've got to find whatever you can to make  some kind of homemade helmet.  Pad that head. 
[00:04:30]  And Danny turned us on to a website yesterday that had a nice montage of all the homemade  helmets, including the guy that is wearing bread on his head.  Just bread.  Just bread.  There he is.  He looks like he's got a Kaiser roll on his forehead, and he's got a couple of baguettes  or something down his ears to protect him.  My dick is this big!  Yeah.  And he's just screaming something, I'm sure.  It's kind of Braveheart.  Braveheart. 
[00:05:00]  Braveheart with bread on your head.  Yeah, I don't think bread armor has ever been used before in history, has it?  I watch a lot of History Channel.  I've seen a lot of shows on armor and chain mail and throughout history, up to Kevlar  and everything.  I don't think I've ever seen bread.  You know, I've been to enough restaurants in New York, and I'm starting to think the  bread helmet would work.  Really?  Most restaurants don't give a fuck if you have fresh bread.  It's stale, it's hard. 
[00:05:30]  But I think the fresher the bread, the better the energy absorption.  No.  I think we've got to go to Mythbusters with this.  Because I think stale bread would crack apart too much, and the projectile might get to  your head.  You know, Bobo wants back on the show, can we give him a bread helmet and just throw rocks  at his head?  Oh my god.  Please?  We should do something where we have him, put a bread helmet on, yeah.  And then have a test where we drop a cue ball from a certain distance.  And go with stale bread, different types of bread. 
[00:06:00]  I want to get down to one slice of fresh wonder bread.  Oh, you missed the joke.  And you could have went local, brother.  Uh-oh.  Pepperidge Farm, let's go.  Pepperidge Farm, that dumb fucking thin Pepperidge Farm shit.  Thinnest bread in the world.  It just, it comes stale.  Fresh, it's stale.  Do you know how much trouble we would get in if we put a bread helmet on Bobo and threw  fucking, threw a cue ball at him?  Threw a cue ball at his head.  It would be fantastic.  Let's slow down a little bit.  Maybe it's oranges.  Maybe it's some kind of fruit. 
[00:06:30]  Here's the, uh...  Ow.  Are they going to show the accident?  Here's the pickup truck going the wrong way.  This guy's filming it from the other side.  He's obviously going the right way.  That looks fucked up.  They teased it on CNN.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  Oh, there is the crash.  Who's the idiot that hit him?  Somebody, it was a clip, though.  It wasn't even that bad.  Ah, his front got pretty fucked up.  Let's see.  All right, where?  They don't have to show the whole lead up.  Wow.  I can't even see what car got him.  Did he hit a car or did he hit something stationary?  Oh.  Yeah, it looks like the damage was on the left, so it looks like a... 
[00:07:00]  I can't tell.  Car nailed him or something.  Oh, and now they're looking concerned.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Elderly California man.  Oh, boy.  Elderly California aren't coming traffic.  Well, fuck that.  You've got to give them tests after a certain age.  You really do.  But just they come back like they care.  Like, oh, that was terrible.  I don't know why we teased that through our commercials and advertising dollars.  That was terrible.  Assholes.  He had his fist on his chin like he was looking at it closely.  Digital confession.  What is this?  Is this something about the sexting? 
[00:07:30]  That might be the teen sexting.  Oh, wow.  Teen sexting.  I don't know.  Examination of content.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  I think it's just religious.  They've got to do some kind of a legitimate digital story, and then they'll go to teen  sexting.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  But the Egypt thing is all...  That's old hat.  That's good.  That's old bread.  It's good.  I was watching all the big news channels last night, and the coverage is lacking.  Yeah.  No one really cares anymore.  They've given up.  Isn't it right now at the prime time of the afternoon? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And this is when they're...  This is the start of the third week of protesting.  Yeah.  But the numbers have drastically dropped.  Yeah.  That show's not as good anymore.  The ratings aren't as good.  No, man.  It was like the lost finale.  A real disappointment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know, because I never saw lost.  I don't know.  Well...  Figured I would try that.  Finale was okay, but that whole season was...  Ugh.  Yeah.  It's the worst drop-off of a show I've ever seen.  No one show...  There were a couple of good episodes in the final season, but that was it.  Yeah.  And then they didn't really go anywhere. 
[00:08:30]  No one show people are talking about, and unfortunately I haven't seen it yet, Shameless.  People are starting to talk about the Shameless, man.  I've seen that one.  Yeah.  We were supposed to have...  What's his name?  Help me out.  Fargo guy.  Oh, William Macy.  William Macy was supposed to come in, and...  Anything.  I guess he chose not to come in.  We said yes, but I think he said no.  Ah, what the Christ.  Oh, Roland's saying he's coming.  What the Christ.  What?  We do have Macy coming in.  When?  William Macy.  When?  Macy?  I don't know.  Roland's coming in. 
[00:09:00]  That's cool.  Wow.  You're darn tootin'd.  Oh, good.  But people are starting to watch...  You're darn tootin'd.  People are starting to watch this Shameless.  Yeah.  We might have to take a peek.  Shameless is good, huh, Roland?  Awesome.  A lot of people saying it's a bit twisted.  I can't get you guys to show us to catch up.  Yeah.  When is he coming in, or are you just fucking with us?  No, no, no.  It looks like either the 18th or 19th, from 930 to 10.  Ah, nice.  It's my deal here, see.  And what is Shameless about?  It's off a British show. 
[00:09:30]  Management here.  That'd be funny if I'd even seen Management.  That's right.  It's when they go to cash their checks.  They can't even make eye contact with the bank teller.  Like, we know, we know.  Hey, guys, enough with Management.  They're good people.  Atta boy, Roland.  Hey, Roland, all right, yeah.  Roland always gets it back on track.  All right, Roland, go ahead.  What's Shameless about?  Basically, William H. Macy plays a drunk, down-out hippie father. 
[00:10:00]  18th and 19th of what?  That's February.  It's a Saturday.  Enough.  I'm talking.  Roland.  We get it.  Plug your date to you.  No, no.  I want to know what the, you said the 19th, but that's a Saturday.  Hey-oh.  He said 18th or 19th.  Hey-oh.  19th to Saturday.  Oh, 17th or 18th.  Okay.  All right.  Thursday or Friday.  Thursday or Friday.  Thursday or Friday.  Of next week.  That lies.  Hey-oh.  So he's like, is he a hobo? 
[00:10:30]  He's a big hippie.  Oh, don't stop.  Like a big hippie drunk.  But he's amazing.  And he's got kids, but he's not home a lot.  No, and Emily Rossum is amazing.  She plays a daughter who tries to keep the family together, working.  Is she hot?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What I saw yesterday, I only saw two minutes, but it opened up with her and just in bra and  panties trying to get her siblings together to go to school.  Oh, my God.  Let me see that.  And she's walking from room to room with just a T-shirt on with no bra. 
[00:11:00]  She's naked a lot.  She is, huh?  I have the first two right now, but I get the rest.  This is fantastic.  Yeah, let's check out this shameless.  I think people are going to really be checking the show out.  It's pretty good.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Emily Rossum.  Emily Rossum.  Yeah.  She should change her name.  Because people are asking.  She should change her last name to Awesome.  Awesome.  Emily Awesome.  Oh, man.  Look at that cute little picture of her in a bikini.  Wow.  She's in a bikini and she's touching her toes sitting down. 
[00:11:30]  That's kind of cool.  That is cool.  I want to pull this thing.  Pull this thing.  Wow.  She's got a lot of bikini pics, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, she's all right, but.  What else was she in?  Shameless.  When she was walking around that house in the bra and panties.  Shameless.  Exactly.  What other shows has she been in, Roland?  Comment?  Roland?  Comment?  Nothing that we know, I think.  No, she looks familiar enough where I've seen her in something.  All right.  The Phantom of the Opera with George Butler she was in. 
[00:12:00]  Day After Tomorrow she was in?  All right.  That I remember.  Yeah.  Mystic River.  Mystic River.  Where do you want like this at the end?  Hey.  Pew.  Our studio's falling apart.  It really is just falling apart at the seams.  I talked about that with one of those guys that comes around every once in a while.  Yeah.  The ice cream man.  We should just call him the ice cream man because they just kind of come by.  Every once in a while the good humor truck comes by and they go, hey, can you help us  out?  And you miss him. 
[00:12:30]  It's like, oh damn, we just missed him.  Shit.  At this point I don't even want to acknowledge they have names because you don't see them  enough.  They're just guys.  Eh, whatever.  And then when they do show up at six, they have to be hanging out by the studio so we  see that they're here.  It's like, yeah, good for you you're here.  We're here every day.  Go do something.  What are you going to do?  So to those guys that are kind of nameless, I sent it in email.  I sent it to your face.  The studio's falling apart.  Could you please fix it?  You just need some basic maintenance.  Right.  And the mouse doesn't work so I don't think we'll be doing phone calls today which will 
[00:13:00]  make Aunt and Jimmy happy, which is fine.  But there are times we do need to take phone calls.  So if you could fix the mouse, that would be good.  And this doesn't look good on the show.  Of course it doesn't look good.  Showtime is filming today.  They don't have any.  Yeah, but why would they care about that?  Why would they even know that Showtime's coming in today?  I bet they don't even know.  See, if I was one of those guys that are nameless and I was in charge of the Opie and Anthony  show and in charge is in the exclamation points because they're not really in charge.  They're laughable.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  I would be here at 545 knowing Showtime was going to be in here filming something to  make sure the place looked good.  Yeah.  So the company looks good.  It's in your shambles.  Right.  It is.  They can't even do that properly.  No.  They don't even understand that.  Like today would be the day to come in early and give us our ice cream and make sure the  fucking studio is set up.  Right.  Where are those things that were hanging from the wall?  I don't know.  I asked about them a month ago.  Part of our fake negotiations, because it was more of a fucking raping, they said they 
[00:14:00]  would clean up this joint and make the studio something we could be proud of or move us  to a bigger studio.  Did they say that?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Oh, I'm not weird.  All that fake bullshit that they tell you when they're trying to resign you.  Yeah.  I don't work that one.  What?  His mouse is all right.  My mouse alone.  What are you doing?  You're grabbing the wrong mouse.  My mouse is fine.  See, I got it for this one.  It's this mouse.  And this.  I just get this to look at.  Holy shit.  I slammed it and it's actually working. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, now it works.  Right.  Mars had to wake up.  Sorry, Mars.  Oh, shit.  Nah, Mars ain't the problem.  Mars works hard.  The people who are the problem know they're the problem.  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  Anyway, where were we, Anthony?  Sorry.  Yeah, we do have Showtime coming in today.  And I guarantee the guys have no idea.  That kind of should be the ones making sure the place looks all nice for Showtime.  So.  What is Showtime?  We got Fedor and Shamrock coming in. 
[00:15:00]  Is Frank Shamrock fighting Fedor?  No, no, no, no.  He's not an announcer.  No, no, he's an announcer.  Yeah, right?  I mean, Shamrock's an animal, obviously.  But, I mean, his time is.  Yeah, he's a little.  Okay, all right.  You scared me.  Fedor's fighting Bigfoot, who could be the ugliest guy in mixed martial arts.  Really?  Bigfoot?  Yeah, he's not a.  You say Bigfoot.  Yeah, he's not a handsome.  What the hell is that about?  Bigfoot's a little.  Yeah, he's not a very handsome man.  Oh, yeah, I know Bigfoot. 
[00:15:30]  What a twisted head he has.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  That is really bizarre looking.  He looks like a Bond villain.  Does he look like Jaws?  He does look like he.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, that's.  Is he really tall?  I don't know how tall he is.  He's big, but he's not as tall as I thought he was when I was watching video of him.  I mean, I'm sure he's over 6'3", maybe.  Wow.  Is he any good?  Yeah, I mean, I think.  Fedor's going to kick his ass?  I don't know.  I hope so.  I mean, he's come back after his first professional real loss. 
[00:16:00]  It's tough to follow any other league besides UFC, I'll be honest with you.  I know.  It really is tough.  I mean, we all know Fedor.  The little I know about mixed martial arts, I know Fedor.  But I don't know the league he's in at all.  Oh, yeah, he's a big guy.  His head is long.  He's a long head.  Yeah, absolutely.  God, gee, his head is massive.  You think his jaw could take a punch?  Holy shit.  I know, right?  Could you see if he's just got a glass jaw?  Yeah.  You tap it and he just falls backwards.  How do you?  I mean, you can't miss the jaw. 
[00:16:30]  No.  But I don't think it's going to do much damage.  It's right there.  What a target, though.  If you want to punch somebody in the jaw, that's a great target to have.  I said exclamation points, and it's quotations, and I do know that.  But people can't move on with their lives until I make the corrections.  So there you go.  Now relax.  Go take your shit and eat a fucking bowl of cereal and go to your shitty job.  Everything's going to be okay.  So he's fighting Bigfoot.  What's his record?  I don't know.  I don't know Bigfoot's record. 
[00:17:00]  Probably should.  Are we going to have Bigfoot, too?  No, just Frank and Fedor.  Are we going to have the Russian mob in here again?  Probably, yeah.  Fuck.  Fedor hangs out with these guys, man.  They dress from, like, 1968, and they speak the English for the Fedor, because the Fedor  speaks the Russian.  Yeah.  He needs an interpreter.  And the interpreter last time was a little...  His manager, yeah.  He was a bit hungover, I thought.  And we were making sure that he was, you know, translating what we were saying properly.  Yeah.  We didn't want to lose our heads. 
[00:17:30]  I've got to have Fedor put me in a hold of some sort.  I was thinking that.  Dude, I regretted not doing that.  I wasn't doing that at one time.  I have to.  I've got three great ones on my channel, and I need a fourth one.  But I had a dream about you last night.  I really did, because I was thinking exactly what Jimmy said.  Every time one of these guys comes in, Jimmy wants to try one of the holds.  And my dream was that it went horribly wrong with Fedor, because he doesn't really speak  English, and the translation was fucked up.  I forgot what your injury was, but it was not good in my dream.  It was not good. 
[00:18:00]  He does, the thing is, though, he understands yelping and a tap, which is what he would get  if he squeezed.  I might want to go into the hold.  What's his move?  He's more like just force, right?  His last few fights, it seems like he's been relying on that one punch knockout.  He wouldn't take a punch from him, obviously.  No, you can't.  You can't.  Didn't our boy Jason Ellis take a punch from him?  Took a kick.  Took a kick from fucking Fedor.  He did a kick.  He took a punch from Liddell in the arm, but he took a kick from Fedor.  But I was watching Fedor train, some of his training videos, and he's a lighter guy for 
[00:18:30]  heavyweight, but his fucking fists are just awful.  I would never take a punch from that guy.  So what the hell are you going to do with him?  I don't know.  I might be in one of his...  You've done most of them already.  No, there's one on the ground, though.  It's some kind of a triangle choke.  I kind of want to go into that one.  It's where they lock their legs around your upper body.  It's the one he got tapped in by Verdum, if you watch.  Do that one.  That guy's arm is pretty much broken.  Fedor, Jesus.  There's one.  The one he lost with was a pretty bad one. 
[00:19:00]  It's kind of where you're trapped by the guy's legs and your arm is getting hyperextended.  Right.  I kind of want to do that one.  No, you don't.  But yeah, he punches really fucking hard.  He's punching so fast, it looks like 1920s footage.  Yeah.  Like sped up film.  It's just...  Obviously, we've discussed it many times.  It's just a bummer he's not in the UFC.  Yeah, I know.  It's just a bummer they couldn't even work that out.  And the good part about Pride is he was standing up, he's kicking the guy in the face while  the guy's down.  You can't do that in UFC.  Yeah.  Oh, you can't. 
[00:19:30]  No.  So we got Fedor coming in with Frank Shamrock, who's just an animal, even though he's just  an announcer these days.  And we got a shitty studio that will look horrible on camera, but no one cares.  So why should we?  It's fine.  The audience will be happy that we bitched less.  So we won't bitch at all.  We'll just fucking rot with this place.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Punch him in the face pretty hard.  He just hammer fists.  Take a hammer fist from the guy. 
[00:20:00]  What he would...  Oh, that was an awful beating.  Let him give you a trolley horse.  You know what?  I would be scared to let him do that.  That's a damn good one.  Ow.  But tell him it's a trolley horse.  Like, don't break my fucking leg, but just give me a good shot where it fucking just  hurts.  They don't...  Oh, look at that.  I don't know if...  Would you take a trolley horse or a fade horse?  No.  Fuck no, man.  I don't think he would do it.  I think he knows he hits so hard.  He might put you in a move that he could slowly put pressure because you're less likely to  get hurt like that.  But I don't think he...  I think he's too, like, too nice a man to actually throw a punch and hit you. 
[00:20:30]  Really?  Yeah.  It's...  Hopefully he'll have a nicer sweater on.  Remember his sweater was all...  It's just the dumbest things you remember about these guys.  Yeah, that was actually on a horrible, like, Christmas sweater.  Yeah, it was really bad.  Knowing that he could just kill anybody with his fists.  Didn't look like an ass-kicking sweater.  Oh, God, no.  It was awful.  It was one of those sweaters like your aunt or your mom gives you and then you have  to, like, quickly bring it back to the store and hope she never notices.  What is it?  A Van Heusen? 
[00:21:00]  It was a gift.  It might as well have been.  It might as well have been.  He's just a savage.  But I hope he wins.  I really like him.  I don't think he'll ever fight in the UFC, though.  No, I think...  And he's getting older now, right?  He's probably 35, 36.  He's got a few years.  Yeah, yeah.  He can make it to almost 40.  If he stays in the strike force.  Yeah, if he got the skills.  He just showed a clip.  The guy's face was right in his balls.  Yeah, there's a lot of that.  They just...  Yeah.  God.  Well, we've got to figure out the hold you're going to go in with.  I know. 
[00:21:30]  I'm thinking triangle choke.  Yeah?  Yeah.  If you could...  Danny, can you Google a triangle choke?  I think that's when you're...  That's a bad one to be...  When you get caught in that, you're in deep, deep trouble.  And what did Fedor do to Jason Ellis again?  I think he just gave him a kick in the leg.  I've got to see that video again.  Yeah, you go to...  Yeah, Danny's got a couple things going on.  Yeah.  Ugh.  That had to hurt like a fuck.  Yeah.  That's...  That's...  Bam.  That's...  Yeah, that's...  I don't...  That's not a world I live in.  I don't even understand how you take a fucking kick. 
[00:22:00]  Did you see footage of Rogan teaching George St. Pierre?  Did I talk about that?  Holy shit!  He's fucking...  He was teaching St. Pierre how to throw like a spinning...  Like his...  The spinning back kick?  Rogan is a fucking deadly fucking kicker, man.  You don't even want to fuck with that guy.  Dude, he's teaching St. Pierre on video and doing it better.  It's hysterical.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  The triangle choke is...  Is this what this is?  Okay, there it is.  It's where the guy's on his back.  Oh, man.  And his legs are locked around your upper torso and your... 
[00:22:30]  Like your...  How would you describe that?  Your...  Right there.  Holy shit!  He uses his own arm...  He uses the guy's own arm to choke him.  Oh, is that what's happening?  Yeah, he like...  He gets around...  Look, now he's pulling his own arm.  It's almost like a figure four.  That's sick!  And then you tap immediately with that.  Of course.  You have to or else you wouldn't be able to.  Yeah.  You're going to be out.  Yeah, the guy... 
[00:23:00]  Because the guy...  You're trapped.  It's like your...  Your head and your arm are through between his legs.  He's holding you there.  I'm a terrible describer of things, which is good for the radio.  I've got to just say...  There's such gayness in that sport.  Thank you.  I was just...  I was about to say...  There's just a lot of gayness.  Any of these MMA guys in the middle of a match or something go to themselves, wow, this is really gay.  It's two men wrapped up and swirmed together in the smallest possible package they could be in.  They're touching every part. 
[00:23:30]  There's never a oops, I'm sorry I touched you there in that kind of fighting.  They don't care.  They're grabbing balls.  Assholes in the face.  Speaking of grabbing balls, it's kind of a segue, but there's a story on Long Island.  You've got a kid with Mercer.  Oh, yeah.  And he's got some, like, super strep throat thing.  And he's in the hospital on a ventilator.  And the dumb news is like, they don't really know how he got the Mercer.  He's a wrestler.  And you're like, yeah, there you go.  It's from the wrestling mats, you assholes.  Those disgusting wrestling mats. 
[00:24:00]  That's how you get the Mercer.  If you're fucking rolling around where someone else was rolling around all sweaty and shit, you might get what they had.  Do you know what you can get?  All sweat.  You get fucking...  And I found this out.  You can get face herpes from the fucking mat.  Oh, man.  These guys have to shower.  Rogan said he uses a special soap.  He said, I forget what it's called.  It's this really intense soap.  He goes, after a shower, just to be saved, he goes, I stand there for a minute.  With this great soap on me.  It's a petri dish, those wrestling mats.  You get face herpes.  All right. 
[00:24:30]  You could get the Mercer, obviously.  Certainly could get, I don't know, a bit of the gay.  A bit of the gay.  You get some of the gay.  We've talked about this.  I just couldn't do that wrestling in high school.  I was one of those guys that wanted to try all the sports when I was growing up.  But wrestling was one I just didn't feel comfortable with.  Too close contact with other gentlemen.  Oh, this is Rogan?  Rogan, what, wiping down his mat?  Yeah, he's got to wipe it down.  Again, you're walking in someone else's sweat barefoot. 
[00:25:00]  But this is him doing, is he kicking?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Who's, who's mat is that?  Is that his training area?  No, I don't know where that is.  That might be, it might even be in Canada.  I'm not sure where this was filmed.  I mean, his basement.  I want him.  But Rogan is throwing an ace.  Imagine you're like, look, because he puts his hands up and you're like, all right, look,  I'm going to fight Rogan.  I'm going to, he's going to try to punch me.  And then he just spins around and kicks you in the face.  But he's kicking like chest level. 
[00:25:30]  It seems like that's a horrible body blow.  Jesus, that's unbelievable.  And he's really teaching it to him.  Like, St. Pierre is.  And he's so fucking fast.  He spins around and gets that.  You'd absolutely think he was going to punch you.  And then a foot would be in your face.  What I love about that is St. Pierre is videotaping like he's seeing something really cool, you  know, because he wanted to learn it.  He goes, can I videotape this so I can, I can watch this and learn how to do this.  But Joe really knows what he's doing.  I would love to see Rogan actually fight. 
[00:26:00]  Me too.  I've tried to start with him.  He pities me like I'm a drunk woman.  Try to mix it up a little with him.  He could get some damage done, don't you think?  Yeah.  He's crazy.  We went out and he's just such a nice guy to everybody.  You have to really, I think, push him to get a fucking punch in the mouth.  But if you did, it would be very unpleasant.  I'm a big fan of the Rogan, man.  I'm a big, a huge fan of his comedy.  It's a bummer he doesn't come around enough for me to check out.  When I was hanging out in L.A. and just to get to see him at the comedy store just kind 
[00:26:30]  of working on shit was, oh my God, it was great.  Yeah, he is great.  It was great.  Because this shit makes you think.  I like when some of these guys make you think and laugh at the same time.  Well, he's like a weird, you don't usually get like really, really tough guys that are  like complete potheads and thoughtful.  He's a really odd combination of people.  Rogan's like four different people in one.  Yeah, really.  Absolutely.  It should just be one guy that could kick your ass.  Or smoke pot.  Or one guy that smokes weed.  Right.  Or one guy that's funny.  Right.  Or a stand-up comic.  Or one guy that thinks about weird shit. 
[00:27:00]  Or one guy that just sits there and could be a physicist.  Well, that goes with the pot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That goes with the pot.  You're right.  He's all three of them.  Yeah.  That's a really hard combination.  He's a renaissance man.  Yeah.  He's a renaissance ass.  Did you guys watch TV last night and just have to deal with the Christina Aguilera thing  on the local news, the national news, sports center?  It was all about her fucking up the stupid national anthem.  Yeah, that seemed to be a big story. 
[00:27:30]  Most of us don't know the words of the damn thing.  But then again, we didn't fuck it up in front of the largest TV audience ever.  Ever.  111 million people.  That beat everything ever televised?  Yeah.  That's it?  Why?  Have they speculated why?  I mean, it's Green Bay and it's the Steelers.  I understand that it wouldn't be a shitty one.  But that drawing, the most viewers of any television show ever watched, ever, ever? 
[00:28:00]  Well, Black Eyed Peas are huge worldwide.  So that brings in people, believe it or not.  People just watch just for the halftime.  Really?  So they turn it on.  But 111 million is, there's a lot.  How many people are in the United States?  300 million, I think.  So that doesn't seem possible that there's over 200 million people in the United States  that did not check out the Super Bowl.  Think about that.  That doesn't seem possible in this day and age.  I think it's also two blue-collar, working-class cities like Pittsburgh and Green Bay. 
[00:28:30]  They have an amazing history of football.  I think people, in a way, get tired of seeing New York, L.A.  It's like these are both cities that the whole country is kind of interested in seeing which franchise won.  But I would say that a lot of people don't give a fuck about the actual game that watched the Super Bowl.  Probably not, yeah.  The commercials, too.  So what brings them in?  Besides, sure, the teams definitely help, but...  I think it's also, it said the most watched.  I think it's just the most on televisions. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Because people aren't literally watching it.  No, you're right.  It's not like the final episode of MASH or something.  Right.  Where the whole room's quiet.  Where everyone's watching every second of it.  This is just on.  I know in my house it was on on probably eight television sets.  So...  You actually helped break the record for it.  Yeah, I think I put it over the top.  Mm-hmm.  So that is a weird thing.  It's not like constantly being watched.  But, eh, the TVs were on. 
[00:29:30]  I guess that's all that they care about.  Oh, this guy got face herpes from the wrestling.  Face herpes?  I didn't even know there was a face herpes.  What line, what line, what line?  Remember when I said the fucking mouse worked?  It doesn't work.  What line, what line?  Can we get the ice cream man?  We need the ice cream man today to give us some good humor and fix our fucking mouse today.  I don't know.  Line, uh, fucking two.  Hey, Chuck, what's up?  Hi.  What's happening, boys?  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey.  Yeah, face herpes. 
[00:30:00]  Talk about some shit that sucks ass.  I had that shit in high school.  Got it from the wrestling mats.  Me and half my team were out for a while, because that shit spread forever.  And it stuck with me, well, it's forever.  Yeah, the herp is forever, man.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Totally.  So where on your face would you outbreak, sir?  Sorry, where on your face?  Just your cheek and your forehead?  My forehead, mostly.  What is it?  It was like whenever I'm in the sun, it would bust out real bad.  It's the low-level herp that I got. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, it's one.  It's the cold sore herp thing.  It's the low-level one that most of the fucking population has.  And I've had it since I was eight, because some stupid aunt or somebody kissed me when  they had it.  Yep.  And it's been my fucking nightmare my entire life.  And you got it on a wrestling mat?  Yeah, man.  And I kind of always got to be mindful.  Like, I got to douche myself with SPF 100, because the sun can cause breakouts.  So to keep me from looking like a shithead all the time, I got to really be aware of it. 
[00:31:00]  He's absolutely right, though, man.  It comes out in the sun.  Mine is the lip one.  It's a fucking pain in the ass.  I just heard about this.  I put a little weapon with my ex-girlfriend, because that stupid bitch got it from me sweating  on her while we were fucking.  So, ha, joke's on.  Yeah, it's extremely easy to pass along, too.  Extremely easy.  And most of the population has it.  You don't want the other one.  No, no.  The other one's the bad one, the sexually treated one.  Yes, number two, yes.  That can be a bear, apparently, if people outbreak.  But you got it from a wrestling mat.  That's fucked up. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking, the nerve endings pop out.  It's a nightmare.  Does it look like herpes on your forehead?  I would never have thought that was herpes on someone's forehead.  It looks like a cold sore.  It looks like dot herpes.  It actually, like, it gets hard, and, like, you have to keep it covered with a Band-Aid,  and you put some shit on it, you know, the Virax or something, and it'll kind of, like,  turn green and scab off.  But, I mean, it's freaking gross, man. 
[00:32:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  That sounds disgusting.  Yeah.  And you guys got it from wrestling.  Yeah, totally.  Yeah.  I just couldn't do the wrestling.  No, no.  Ew.  Dude, that's tough, man.  Do you want to?  I'm glad I could bring up the level of the show today, guys.  No worries.  Contribute.  Yeah.  No worries.  But I just heard about this when I was in Austin, and Joe and I went out with Kenny  and Joe's buddy to eat.  It was like he was just talking about what we were eating.  I was like, fuck, I didn't know you could.  See, you saw Rogan.  He had towels and all sorts of stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  He knows how to keep his shit clean. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  His mat's clean, himself clean.  He's got the soaps.  I guess if you're in that world, you just understand it.  You learn.  I bet you most people get it in high school and stuff before you know.  Like when you're around guys that are professionally trained, everybody knows by that point.  Yeah, but when we were growing up, we didn't have all these anti-soaps.  I'm still fucking tired.  Antibacterial.  I know the word.  I'm just tired.  We didn't have any of that.  We had just one lousy bar of soap that didn't even smell good. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  That cleaned everything.  But I want to know what that soap is.  It's like a natural soap.  It's supposed to be really strong.  I'm always looking for a new soap.  You want to talk to a guy?  I like soaps.  I do.  You want to talk to a guy who has herpes on his neck from wrestling?  Oh my God, yeah.  I didn't know you could get this.  And why is it just on your neck?  Like wouldn't it just spread everywhere?  That's a really good question because mine is just on my bottom lip.  Which I don't get as much anymore because I don't, believe it or not, you'll laugh when 
[00:33:30]  I say this, but I don't stress as much as I used to because stress brings it out big  time.  Do you take anything for it?  The Valtrex.  Also, there's a...  The Valtrex, when you do have a breakout, knocks it down and it keeps it way down your  body for a long time.  Lysine is supposed to be good too.  It's some kind of a natural amino acid, I think.  Yeah.  I think lysine is supposed to be good.  But I don't get as much, thank God.  But it concentrates on one area for whatever reason.  Yeah, just rushes back to the same spot.  Maybe Dr. Steve could explain that.  Well, it's herpetic and... 
[00:34:00]  Let me say hi to Garrett in Orlando who's got...  Look, look, to the assholes that kind of babysit this fucking place, really.  Which line do you want me to plunk down?  Yeah, but we shouldn't have to do it that way.  I do agree.  Line seven.  What's the guy's name?  Could he come in one morning and see if everything's set up nice?  Hey, Garrett.  What's going on?  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Love you guys.  Love you guys.  Love you guys.  Love you guys.  Love you guys.  Love you guys. 
[00:34:30]  Sorry.  I picked up junior year of high school.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got to explain what happened.  Something happened here, Carlo.  I decided to go fucking Southpaw with the mouse.  And because it had a wire, it decided it wasn't going to go in the direction of Juan to throw  the thing.  And it went flying at Anthony.  And then it hit one of his buttons.  It hit my butt.  Oh, is that what that was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what that was.  Oh, that's actually kind of cool.  Dude, if there was a little longer wire, this would have fucking itched in the head. 
[00:35:00]  That would have felt awful.  Clunk.  Sorry about that.  All right.  What do you got, Garrett?  Hey.  Yeah.  Junior year of high school was basically weighing in, getting ready to start a wrestling match.  And this guy was just covered head to toe in these doors.  And I wanted the medic to check him out.  The medic checked him out, cleared him to wrestle.  And a couple weeks later, I started breaking out on my neck.  So I went to the dermatologist, and the dermatologist is taking pictures. 
[00:35:30]  It's the worst thing he's ever seen.  I've got herpes that break out on my neck that cover my entire neck that just feet and  pus, and it's nasty.  Anytime I go out in the sun, my life is ruined.  So is it on the front of the neck or the side, like whenever you bend your head?  Basically, right on your Adam's apple, it comes out real big and just spreads out on both  sides.  And you get it in the same place every time?  Every single time.  I did not know that, because I always wondered about the lip thing.  I didn't know if you, like the guy with the forehead and now you with the neck. 
[00:36:00]  I had no idea.  That is horrible.  It's horrible.  It's right.  It ruined my fucking life.  So how often do you outbreak, sir?  Probably like twice a year.  Yeah, that's about right.  And it just completes me, you know, shuts me down.  I can't do anything.  Do you do the Valtrex?  Yeah, I used to be on Famvear, and they changed it up.  Samvear?  Master of Japan, who helps the herp?  You just crank up his music and it goes away? 
[00:36:30]  And the herpes hides.  It's terrible.  I know.  When you start talking about Valtrex, everyone's starting to think out there, oh, fuck, sexually  transmitted.  It's not.  This is very different, man.  But the Valtrex definitely knocks it down and helps.  And it's brutal.  Going to CVS, going to pick it up, you know, you look like you're talking to a hot chick  behind the counter picking up your Valtrex.  Oh, really?  You know what she's got?  That's what you do.  You go, what do you have?  Stop looking at me. 
[00:37:00]  What salve do you have?  AZT.  Right.  You never try to fuck the pharmacist unless you're only picking up Allegra D.  If you're picking up Nexium, you might be able to fuck her.  But if you're picking up Valtrex and Cialis, she's like, do you never learn?  They really do know everything about you, the pharmacist.  Oh, it's humiliating.  Oh, it's humiliating.  You know what?  I went recently to a pharmacist.  Pharmacists are dumb.  You've got to hang up the phone.  Oh, which one?  This is how you do it.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:37:30]  After all these fucking years.  Thank you, Jimmy.  What were you saying?  No, she was a pharmacist.  And I go there.  And I had my throat.  I was coughing last week.  So I got some antibiotics just to knock it out.  It was something.  And I go to pick it up.  And my girl is kind of behind me.  So I go.  And she goes, oh, do you have the Z-Pak?  Which was for, uh, it's an antibiotic.  Yeah, strep throat and all that, right.  But it could also, I think, be for a VD.  It's like, the pharmacist.  Oh, right, right.  I think an antibiotic you can use for something else.  I wouldn't doubt.  And I'm thinking to myself, like, I don't care because it's strep. 
[00:38:00]  But shut the fuck up.  Don't announce what I'm getting.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Oh.  What's the matter with you?  Unless it's, are these your magnum condoms?  Then what are you doing?  Like, what a stupid woman.  Fucking announcing it.  I once ran into, uh, you know what?  I'm going to shut up.  It's such second nature to them.  Oh, what?  Yeah, I guess, I guess I, who'd you run into?  I, I, uh, fuck.  What's wrong with me?  An old coworker or a friend?  I ran into an old coworker at a pharmacy who was, who was, uh, sheepishly picking up something 
[00:38:30]  at the pharmacist and, and was like, was like, oh, fuck, what are you doing here as  I pick this up?  I don't know what was in the bag, but his body language said a lot.  Oh, really?  That there was something, uh.  Was he walking like a, had suppositories in?  Are you a small dog with him?  Oh, no.  Getting some soup. 
[00:39:00]  I'll shut up now.  But it was one of those, oh, what are you doing here as the bag is kind of like going  into a backpack and, well, see you, see you tomorrow.  Yeah, you never know.  God, you never want people to see what you get at the pharmacy.  It's just awkward.  Yeah, it really is.  And you got to say, like, you know, your name and then, and then they go, uh, okay.  And then they, they blurt out the name of the prescription.  You're like, oh yeah, okay.  That's good.  Right.  Hey, um, we're talking about, you know, the herpes and you know how we have to keep going 
[00:39:30]  until we have to tap out.  Well, if Jimmy could plunk down a line, uh, oh, is this going to be, okay.  I like this new system.  Makes everything a team effort.  Line seven.  It's Larry in Georgia.  Larry, go ahead, buddy.  Hey, well, hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Larry.  First time through.  All right.  I've been listening for years.  All right.  More information, please.  Same thing as Opie said.  Evidently one of my son's aunts or something kissed him near his eye or maybe on his hand 
[00:40:00]  or something and he rubbed his eye.  Now he's had herpes of the eye.  Nah, I always wondered about this herpes of the eye.  We've heard this over the years here and there.  Yeah.  Is that possible?  Yeah.  This guy's saying it, huh?  Oh, yeah.  What does that mean?  He's on battle track.  It's the same thing as the other guy said.  Anytime sunlight hits his eyes, he just doesn't shine, man.  Well, the good news is your eyes don't really hit sunlight ever, so.  Jesus. 
[00:40:30]  Danny.  Yeah, our house looks like a dungeon.  How old is he?  He's 12.  Ah.  And what does it look like?  Is it around the eye?  No.  No.  You really can't even see anything by looking at him.  His eyes look fine, but anytime the sunlight or a bright light hits his eyes, he just starts  crying, man.  I mean, just...  There's some that are on the outside of the eye, but then there's some that are actually  on the eyeball itself.  All right.  Thank you, Chef.  And you can get a herpetic infection on the eye itself. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  What would you take?  Herpes of the eye or the dick?  Wow.  Jesus, Jimmy.  I ask that to every date.  And they say, I have both, so.  No, that's not what they say.  Uh-oh.  Well, I guess you could...  I'm going to get both.  I guess you could hide the herpes of the dick, so I might have to go dick.  Yeah, wow.  Who wants to walk around with a herpes sore around their eye?  And your eyes, you use for everything.  Yeah, but the big reveal. 
[00:41:30]  True.  The big reveal, if you're like, hi, look at this.  Hey, suck on my chopped meat.  Yeah, but it wasn't...  It wasn't...  It was a tough question.  It wasn't like, would you rather have herpes of the eye or an ice cream sundae?  I'd go with the sundae.  Oh, I thought you were asking.  Of course.  Both answers are going to be rough.  Yes.  You want another one?  Jerome in Florida, and then he's got the herp of the eye.  I need to learn more about the herp of the eye, Jimmy.  The aligned tree. 
[00:42:00]  Hello?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Jerome.  Yeah, I got it when I was about 12.  I'm 28 now.  And really, when I was younger, it's like a cloud, like a white cloud kind of covering my vision.  It disappeared into a cloud.  Yeah, exactly.  And it happened when my uncle, he dropped a beer bottle.  It cracked the cornea in my eye, and then I took a flight across the country. 
[00:42:30]  And I guess whatever bacteria got in my eye happened, and I was in the hospital for like three weeks.  I'm never leaving my house.  And I took medication, and basically whenever I'm sick, my body's weak.  It just goes straight to my eye.  Can't see very well, and then, you know, I get better, and it's fine.  I don't take anything now.  I don't take anything now because now I'm like, I don't have any reactions.  But I also used to get it on my face because of it and on my lips.  Herpes? 
[00:43:00]  It's pretty fucking annoying.  Wait a minute, you think that all came from a dropped beer bottle?  No, stupid.  It came from me flying.  From what?  He said that I guess his cornea was caught or whatever, injured, so, and then, you know.  It left it open for bacteria from the airplane to get in.  But you wouldn't get herpes that way, sir.  Well, that's how they said it.  Jerome.  He probably went into the bathroom and then rubbed his eye.  Jerome.  With fucking, what happened?  What Dominican sat on your face?  Oh.  You got a little bukkake in that cut in your eye, didn't you? 
[00:43:30]  Where were you when the hooker sat on your face with her dirty ass?  But he thought it was a good idea because you were still a virgin.  Wait.  How old were you?  I'd say I was probably 12 or 13.  I might be a little too young.  I think someone's mind made it a beer bottle, but I think something else might have gotten rubbed on his young face.  A beer bottle, was it?  No, no, no.  Would he shake it up in your face a lot? 
[00:44:00]  No.  That beer bottle, you know.  Would it have two little cozies?  Two cozies.  Was it a long neck?  Ah, yeah.  Let's do beer jokes.  Yeah, was there a little piece of skin that went up over the top?  Hopefully it wasn't a foster skin.  That would make it hurt to sit down.  I'm suffering.  You came to the right place for the sympathy. 
[00:44:30]  Yes, sir.  We apologize.  All right, Jerome.  Bye.  Which one is it?  Whatever.  Did I get it?  Maybe we can wake up the sleepyheads and they can come in here and fix some of this shit so we can broadcast properly.  Did I do good?  And bring fucking ice cream.  We want ice cream today.  All right.  Why don't we break?  Ooh.  Time to eat.  No.  Oh, time to do reeds.  Valentine's Day is around the corner, isn't it?  Apparently.  That's what everything that plays in front of me says. 
[00:45:00]  Valentine's Day is right around the corner.  Do you want me to do one today?  Yeah, that'd be fun.  I'll just eat some soup.  I could use some soup.  I mouth this down in between fucking...  I'm thinking I should do one today.  That's why you hear, like...  Maybe I'll do one today.  Have fun.  Vince Neil's 50 today.  Wow.  Really?  Just look down at that.  Where did time go?  He's been around a long fucking time.  He doesn't take talks away, though. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, but Jesus.  All right.  It's AARP territory.  Yeah, okay.  We got a lot of cool stuff to talk about after the break.  Stay there.  Call the O&A show at 866-1211.  That's 866-969-1969.  That's great.  Kopey and Anthony.  Oh, we're putting the studio back together? 
[00:46:00]  Aw.  We're getting our...  Oh, my God.  Katy Perry, huh?  Katy Perry's got a slamming body.  She really does.  She's got those big and heavies.  Yeah.  You wouldn't expect her to have such giant cans.  What is that?  Those are Photoshopped?  Yeah, I thought so.  What's Photoshopped?  Anything of her nude.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hate those Photoshopped. 
[00:46:30]  Bam, bam, bam.  Why is it so low in the background?  It's either way too low or way too loud.  Oh.  Valentine's Day around the corner.  Yeah, it is.  I heard tell.  Yeah.  And this is a news story we probably should have done a couple days ago.  You know those little candy hearts? 
[00:47:00]  Remember those?  The little sweet hearts?  They used to only have a couple sayings on them.  I love you or what.  I don't even remember some of the other things they used to say in the old days.  Oh, you cunt.  You cunt is one of them.  Yeah, that was on there.  That was a good one.  A flick to her.  Right.  Well, the news story has a fine little piece on the candy heart.  Nice.  Small candy.  Big.  Big impact.  It really does say that, doesn't it?  As plain as day. 
[00:47:30]  The message on this small candy heart, we can't show you because it uses a derogatory  term for a woman's chest.  What?  Tits is derogatory?  Just the way the news describes it.  A derogatory term for a woman's chest.  He couldn't even say breast.  Her chest.  A chest-like area around it.  Oh, I hate them.  I really do hate them.  A term for a woman's chest.  I thought it was kind of shocking.  12-year-old Sierra Bush says she was eating a bag of candy conversation hearts when she 
[00:48:00]  stumbled on the naughty message.  I was reading them, and I brought it to my mom after I saw it.  Awkward.  Oh, God.  Would you bring it to your mom if you were 12 years old?  You little rat kid.  I'd give it to my mom.  She was all mad.  I ran to my mommy, and...  Is there a lawsuit going now?  Are they going to sue for it?  I honestly don't know, but you want to...  Let's guess.  Yeah.  What do you think's happening here?  Maybe they're going to contact the lawyer and go, you know, this is inflicting damage 
[00:48:30]  on a child.  Yes.  And ask for some type of...  A 12-year-old girl sees that, and she doesn't have any, so she was all insulted like it was  a joke.  I think the 12-year-olds have heard that word before, huh?  Yeah, probably.  Yes.  I think so, too.  And I brought it to my mom after I saw it.  Awkward?  Yes.  Well, my daughter comes up to my wife and says, thanks, Mom, for the Valentine's Day, and  we both read it, and both of our jaws drop.  Derek DeAnda, Sierra's parent, emailed the company and got a quick response, asking him  to send the candy and the entire bag back so they could investigate. 
[00:49:00]  So they could have no evidence.  Derek was shocked.  He says he doesn't have any plans to sue.  He just wants to warn other parents.  I wanted to bring it to everybody's attention.  You know, watch what you get.  Check it before you send it off to school.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  God forbid.  God, it says tits on it.  God forbid someone sees the word tits, a girl sees the word tits on a piece of candy.  What I love is it was somebody that was very disgruntled at the factory.  Yeah.  Fuck this place paying me no money. 
[00:49:30]  Our jaws dropped.  Right.  All right, so.  You have your flip cam, dude, today?  Yeah.  Your flip cam footage is better than the regular camera footage.  It's like when we, if I, if we, just for my own personal use, it comes up better than  the other stuff does.  Yeah, you got it done with some of the videos I got of you.  Yeah, it comes up better than regular cameras does.  I'm in the market for a new camera, but I want it small enough where I could pretty much  put it in my pocket.  I want like the next level after HD flip. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah?  What is that?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  Like, but you need something small.  Yeah, because I, I, I like carrying it wherever the fuck I go.  Yeah, those are handy like that.  I'm always seeing dumb shit.  But you want a few more features?  I heard the Kodak one's pretty cool, but I think it's, uh, it's comparable to the HD  flip, so I don't know.  Yeah, it's kind of bigger too.  I'm going to make a trip down to the, uh, the, the Hasidics and see what they see.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, B&H here in New York.  They rule B&H.  The only fucking place to go.  And, and, and, and Jews know how to sell electronics.  And Kodak goes underwater. 
[00:50:30]  I do know that.  But what am I going to fucking film underwater?  Iraq.  A fight with a Frenchman.  Oh, God.  Imagine.  Fuck.  That would be a video.  A little scuba diving.  No, the B&H guys, customer service, out the ass too, man.  Those guys will hang with you forever until your questions are answered.  Wonderful.  They really are great.  They know everything.  They're great.  Everything.  At B&H.  They look a little funny, but man, do they know how to sell cameras.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why I buy all my gear. 
[00:51:00]  Do you?  Yeah.  Got everything there.  Yeah, I got to figure it out.  But anyway, uh, his boy's 13, he heard the story, and it was told as nice twat.  Uh, but we just saw the candy.  Yeah.  Said tits.  Uh, Mike in St. Louis.  Mikey.  Mike.  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hey, man.  Yeah, my boy.  My boy.  He told me about this, you know, uh, I think it was yesterday morning he told me about it.  But you know how kids, you know, they, they go on and the stories get a little mixed up  and, and, but when he told me the story, it was nice twat. 
[00:51:30]  You know, so I don't think nice kids would really upset anybody.  None of these words should upset anybody.  Yeah.  But hey, I mean, that's, you do realize your 13 year old has heard every curse word by now,  right?  You know, you're not, you're not.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I say them.  Yeah.  There you go.  It takes the power out of it.  Yeah.  Well, that's the same with the porno.  I've got full custody of him.  I tell him if he wants to look at tits on the internet, I don't give a fuck.  There you go.  Right on.  All right. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, the, yeah, the Kodiak ZI nine.  Thank you, Dave C in New York city.  I heard a good things about that up there.  Yeah.  A bear Kodiak.  And then Jim Boyd in Cincinnati says the new flip has wifi.  Did you know that?  No.  Really?  Upload right from the flip.  Get the fuck out of here.  That would be cool.  That's pretty good right there.  Is that really happening, Danny?  Can you find, is it HD as well?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything's HD.  Everything is HD.  It's silly to get something that isn't HD.  That's not even special anymore.  No.  Well, unless you have an agent that decides, you know, he needs to get to send you a fucking 
[00:52:30]  camera that doesn't have HD.  Did Bob do that?  So there's dust on it.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, shit.  What, you had to save 150 bucks?  Wow.  You know how much money we give you?  Damn, that's, you know, you could say you liked it and thank you.  Now, Bob does give the old school gift.  Like when he said the Apple TV was the 1975 version.  It actually had rabbit ears on it.  I got excited because he gave me a camera.  So, you know, because it was a wedding gift.  So you got all the marriage stuff, the honeymoon stuff. 
[00:53:00]  You got, and now the kids stuff.  And it should be the camera that I just pull out at all my parties.  Standard def.  Yes.  I'm like, what the, who the fuck sends a camera that's not HD?  I'm very ungrateful.  Standard definition, anything.  And I have no problem telling you.  I hate television shows that are like that.  We all have widescreens now.  Whoever doesn't, go fuck yourself.  Even the poor people have widescreens.  Steal one, whatever you got to do.  Because I'm tired of that.  And then who was that?  Was that you that pointed that out, Danny, with the graphic? 
[00:53:30]  If you look at the news graphics on HD news shows, you'll notice a lot of them put the, their logos, like their corner, the little bug and the ticker.  It only fills the screen up for standard definition, even though the edges are open wider, so that the standard definition people don't get their, their little logo cut off.  So you're watching it on a widescreen.  It ends up being too close to the, the middle of the picture. 
[00:54:00]  Like that.  Yeah, look, see?  So you can crop it for four, three.  That doesn't have to be in the middle of the fucking picture.  It should be on the end.  Yeah, right on the edge.  But they got to get their logo.  So they got to get it in there, even for the standard definition idiots that still have fucking shit TVs.  Ugh.  It's, I saw, oh God, and speaking of the fucking logo and all that crap on the bottom of the screen that I know Jimmy loves because it blocks everything.  They teased a story about this old man and old lady dancing to some fucking shit music, whatever. 
[00:54:30]  It was a shit story.  But, but, uh, they had so much crap stacked on top of each other on the bottom, uh, three quarters of the screen.  A bottom quarter or a third of the screen that you couldn't see the, the people, you saw their hair.  I swear because it was taken like from, from above.  So you could kind of see him from the chest up, I guess.  If, if you, you had no obstructions.  Because it was, it completely covered them. 
[00:55:00]  And they're talking about, oh, look at that.  Look, oh, he's dipping her.  You don't see anything.  You know what it is?  It's just laziness by the news.  Like, the fact that they allow that during a certain part where you need to see it.  Right.  It shows you how little somebody's paying attention.  That's just the standard.  Let it run.  They don't care what it looks like.  Someone should be on that all the time looking to see if it's interfering with the picture and, uh, and cut it out and then pop it back on. 
[00:55:30]  Nobody reads stock tickers on the fucking television.  You don't need it.  And I don't need, by the way, the logo on Fox turning HD spitting and these other things zipping along.  I don't need zipping.  It's a lot of attention.  You get, you know, it's got to draw your attention.  Look at that.  Things are coming in.  They're popping in and out.  Yeah, split screen, talking, zipping, Fox HD.  CNN does it too.  Zipping.  America's here.  Zoom.  Fox ticker.  Oh, oh, what's stock up to?  We got it. 
[00:56:00]  Constant motion.  We don't know who's reading that.  I'm looking at MSNBC.  They have a news ticker on the bottom.  Who can read the news ticker and hear the guy talking?  No.  Well, it's some other news I want you to read right below me and try to listen to what I'm saying and read that.  It's an impossibility.  You have to read, watch, and hear at the same time.  And they're three different things.  Who wants to do that?  Three different things.  And you look at the ticker too long and then you look at the picture and it seems to be moving the other way.  Like your eyes get used to the ticker moving one way.  Stop with the news scroll on the news. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  You don't need it.  You really don't.  They used to just use that when there was some kind of big breaking story during like you'd be watching a TV show.  You'd be watching Columbo or MASH.  God, are you dating yourself, butt?  And then at the bottom it would be like a news bulletin, breaking news.  You'd be like, this has got to be some heavy shit.  You always knew it was going to be something awful.  Because they wouldn't just pop that on.  Now it's like every stupid story scrolls down.  And your TV would, you know, start making the noises because it can't even handle that extra information they're going to now give you. 
[00:57:00]  It couldn't deal with it.  You're right though, man.  And then sometimes they would just go, we interrupt this program for a special news bulletin.  Remember the feeling you got?  You'd be like, all right.  Because it would say like breaking news and they'd cut the whole fucking show off.  But you knew it was some good shit.  Yeah, it had to be.  That wasn't really going to affect your life but would make your TV viewing much better.  The North Vietnamese Army.  Like, oh, the Tet Offensive. 
[00:57:30]  I think that's the last one that ever happened.  Are we giving up on making believe we're younger than we are?  I won't give a shit.  Look, I was alive during NOM.  I actually went.  I killed like 30 of them.  Shut up.  What's that?  Look at Fox.  Dude, do they need to have, they have the HD over the Fox spinning and the two little spotlights on the five.  Right, right.  Yeah, look at that.  718, 40 degrees.  They have Newark, Dutchess County.  They have school district information.  Two hour delay, two hour delay.  And above that they have woman meets hero after daring rescue and a big red thing. 
[00:58:00]  And above that they have exclusive.  And then there's graphic of a camera lens on the right of that.  And then behind them they have a TV screen with a graphic on it.  It's literally a third of the screen is missing.  Yeah.  And the Fox logo has to be spinning.  And it has to show you that it's in HD.  Even though we're all savvy to the HD thing.  I'm guilty though because I did that for the compound too.  I put spinning things in graphics.  What are they doing?  So you're doing the exact same thing.  But I'm trying to be ironic.  It's a third of it. 
[00:58:30]  Like I'm trying to do it on purpose.  I want to fill the screen up with stuff.  They have these beautiful.  They've got to point to all that stuff and say this is ironic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look.  Or people don't know it's ironic.  Look at this irony.  Yes, Jimmy.  They've got this beautiful technology.  HD stuff looks great.  And they're just wrecking it.  Yeah.  Ew.  With that guest?  Oh, it's weird.  We don't need.  Wrong color.  That must be good.  Well, they could adjust the tone on that a little bit.  I think they didn't white balance the camera.  They don't want you listening to the radio too.  They're trying to do everything. 
[00:59:00]  Why don't they just have a scale hooked up to the TV so you can weigh yourself and have  your blood pressure in the fucking CNN logo.  That's awful.  Maybe they can feed it to the pundits and their mouths can mouth what your weight is.  Just so you feel like you're a part of the TV experience.  Scrolling.  Stock ticker.  What's happening?  Fucking six in the morning.  Just show me something.  TV's not supposed to raise your blood pressure because you feel like you've got to take  everything in there and throw it at you.  And if you need the info, it's right there at your fingertips these days. 
[00:59:30]  If I want to know what my stocks are doing, I'm not going to sit there and have a convulsion  looking at all kinds of stocks until mine might come up.  You know, I was thinking today on the way in that we have to finally call it.  We've been doing radio a long time and what do we do every day?  We go through newspapers?  Yeah.  I think I go through newspapers out of habit, I realized, today, finally.  Because everything is on my iPad that I need and it's way more updated. 
[01:00:00]  They're talking about Christina Aguilera fucking up the lyrics of the National Anthem in the  paper today because they couldn't get it in yesterday's edition.  It's old news.  Because the Super Bowl ran late.  Right.  They sort of updated a little bit to make it look like, no, this is the latest on it.  But no, they needed to get the story in their paper finally, which means they're like 24  hours behind.  Oh, you have to subscribe.  Okay, that's because I have the post of the daily news.  But I like holding these papers sometimes, too.  There's something about reading one of these local papers.  It's like the Times is too big and smart. 
[01:00:30]  I'm done with the Times.  I realize I just do it out of habit in newspapers.  I really, you know, it's done, man.  How about fucking Huffington Post making $350 million yesterday?  AOL deal, yeah.  Holy shit.  A lot of people say AOL's crazy for that, too.  They're saying Huffington probably will end up in charge of AOL, like running AOL.  Wow.  Well, yeah, that's fucked up.  Who goes to AOL?  I know, exactly.  You know what?  It's still massive.  A lot more people than you think.  It's still huge. 
[01:01:00]  A lot of people are still stuck in that training wheel zone where they just feel like they have  to have AOL.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Actually, a lot of people are going to the new AOL.com.  That's right.  Ixnay.  Lots of people still go.  Lots of people still go.  Hence why the advertising made my point.  I was surprised, actually, how much they have podcasts and shit like Carolla.  They have Kevin Smith.  Yeah.  They do a lot of...  So, basically, they're making a comeback.  They've reinvented.  Okay.  Yeah, they've reinvented.  I know I'm...  They know it's not the training...  AOL used to be the training wheels for the internet. 
[01:01:30]  I know I'm the dummy that still pays for AOL.  I have not been on my AOL account in probably...  Isn't it free?  Probably five to...  Yeah.  But I was one of the...  But you have to tell them, look, it's free.  You can't change your billing options?  It's free.  So...  Nothing?  So why don't you guys do the right thing and stop billing me?  No, you've got to kind of search them out.  Say, wait a minute.  It's free, so why are I...  Oh, and then they do the right thing.  They don't give you customer service if it's free.  Only if you pay for it do you get a customer service.  So you need customer service for it. 
[01:02:00]  So I've been paying for this.  I don't even know how to get on my old accounts.  I don't even remember my passwords anymore.  Everybody forgets their passwords.  I don't even remember.  I'm still paying for it.  On your credit card bill, you're like, next month I'll cancel it.  Month after month, it's whatever it is.  I forgot what it's up to now.  $25 or $30?  Yeah.  That's insanity.  It used to be very important to have AOL.  Well, not anymore for that anyway.  But AOL.com is great.  Go there for all your news.  No, it sounds like they're trying to do different things.  They own Gawker Media, I do believe. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, Gawker's.  Good.  Yeah, it's a huge ring of media science.  So they're smart.  They actually kind of came in from the other angle.  What they need to do better, AOL needs to do better, is their spam filters.  Because every time I get like a blast of email spam, it's from someone's AOL account.  They need to rebrand themselves.  Because any time you ever hear AOL, it just, it kind of, to me anyway, it brings me back  into that older zone.  It always makes me think older.  Yeah.  So they really need to get into my brain and let me know that AOL's, you know, it's new 
[01:03:00]  and you could do a lot of different things.  And you should be able to block people easier.  Like, when I get certain, I literally have been getting a Huffington Post email, Foundry  Music, like for years, and I put them in spam.  Yes.  And they won't let you just block it automatically.  You will not spam me out of your life.  What did you say, Iraq?  Iraq, I can't not hear you.  No, no, no, no.  Go ahead.  What did you just say to me in my ear?  I didn't know if you had mentioned it already.  I was looking online.  And mention what?  About the AOL-Huffington Post deal. 
[01:03:30]  He heard spam and perked up.  He thought he was going to get a sandwich.  He actually says to me in my ear, he goes, and Huffington Post just bought AOL.  That's how this whole discussion started.  Iraq, how did you not hear that?  What are you doing?  What are you listening to?  You might be doing something real.  No, I was looking up AOL, so I did not, I heard it, but I did not, it didn't register  that I heard it.  We started the conversation with Huffington Post AOL, so how could you have a look at it?  Our guest today is the very obese and clumsy, Eric Nagel. 
[01:04:00]  Eric, please tell the audience what you did wrong now.  Ah, what the crazy.  Jesus.  Was there another clip that might be good, too?  Which one?  I don't know.  Someone might have given another Stacey Keech.  Oh, you like that one?  I like that one.  All of a sudden, someone from management appears and offers no support.  Oh, no.  I fucked it up.  Out of nowhere, a Nagel appears.  The show swerves to avoid it, but there's no hope. 
[01:04:30]  A Nagel is just too big and has made too many mistakes.  The hosts scramble to get a hold of the situation.  Oh, the situation.  The situation.  Those both make me laugh really hard.  I love that.  He's in New York.  We've got to get him back in here and do more stuff.  He's great.  It's way too good.  He's going to be in the building tomorrow.  He's doing, I think, something for, I'm going to guess, Unmasked or something.  He's doing something tomorrow.  Oh, fuck.  Wait for a little bit.  Ron Bennington?  Maybe we can have him pre-tape something or tape after Ron and just do something.  Yeah, let's try to get some more lines.  I don't know what, but yeah. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Hey, shopper ingested semen-tainted yogurt sample.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Do you do the samples at the supermarkets?  It's never.  Never.  You don't?  Nope.  No.  Why?  I'm with Anthony.  Because of this.  Because they're fucking disgruntled people that have to give out samples.  They're angry.  Yes.  They're not happy people.  They're on the sidewalk with some kind of like frozen yogurt.  You want to try some?  Oh, yeah.  Try this.  And they got their dumb little spoons in their little cup. 
[01:05:30]  Right.  That you get one thing from, but it comes out of this vat of fucking shit that's been sitting  there the whole time.  Now.  But how do you get, how do you know you've just eaten cum?  I mean, that's, how does somebody know?  Oh.  I probably know.  Know the taste.  Uh-oh.  That was some good acting, Jimmy.  I knew what to do with my hands.  Acting class is going well for you.  Confirming the suspicions of a New Mexico woman, a yogurt sample provided to her last  month by a grocery clerk contained semen. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, God.  According to test results that prompted police to secure a search warrant authorizing them  to collect blood and DNA samples from the subject.  I don't get how this.  Then they realized it was a called Dannon's semen yogurt.  The disclosure that the yogurt sample from an Albuquerque market tested positive for  sperm cells.  Wow.  And saliva.  Oh, God.  How do they know if the woman ate it, though?  Through the yogurt.  Yeah.  How do you know if she ate through the yogurt?  Let me see.  When police arrived to investigate the January 25th incident at the Sunflower Farmer's Market. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, God.  I hate farmer's markets, too.  Yes.  Are you a fan of the farmer's market?  No.  Where all the vegetables look sick because they don't have chemicals pumping them up?  No, you need chemicals, hormones.  You really do.  DNA, fucking scientific shit.  I don't know what we're eating, but, man, your fucking fruits look terrific.  I don't care.  They look great.  They arrested Garcia after determining he was the subject of two outstanding warrants  connected to a 2009 bus for criminal sexual contact with a minor.  Oh, see, he's a pervert.  These are the guys that are giving your samples. 
[01:07:00]  He was serving Dan in yogurt.  According to a police report, when does this story get really good?  The 28-year-old victim was shopping with her daughter.  The first spoonful.  Shopping with her daughter in the store's cereal aisle when she was approached by Garcia,  who worked in the store's dairy department.  After accepting Garcia's offer of a yogurt sample, the woman immediately thought the sample tasted  gross and disgusting.  Oh, God. 
[01:07:30]  And cops reported said it tasted like semen.  What a good egg she is.  That's a guy who has this trained woman.  She sucks a lot of dick.  If out of context in the supermarket, she's like, I'll try that.  Come.  This is cum.  She's like a drug-sniffing dog.  She just sat down and looked at her owner.  She's a spitter, too, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  In a handwritten statement, the woman said, I spit it out on the floor many times because  I was upset. 
[01:08:00]  And what was the guy doing?  Did he realize the gig was up?  Or what did he do?  The woman recalled that.  Jerking off in another thing of yogurt.  Yeah, he said, don't waste that.  That took three hours.  Adam.  Holy shit.  Listen to this fucking asshole.  Well, the woman recalled that when she talked to manager Catherine Flores, she told me it  was Greek yogurt.  People love it.  It has a lot of protein on it.  Come on.  She didn't say that.  The woman paid for her groceries, returned home, where she told her boyfriend about the 
[01:08:30]  incident she told of how Garcia had just come with one sample just for me, and that  he was so pushy to tell me how to taste it.  The woman and her boyfriend eventually returned to the market where they summoned the police.  Wow.  I wonder what this woman did to the guy that was handing out the samples.  Probably nothing.  Yeah, he's just probably sexually acting.  Probably just like, is it kook?  Or maybe she was hot.  Maybe she was the proper type for him.  But how did they get this?  What did they, like, how did she keep the sample?  Did she keep the cup?  Or how did they get it?  Or was he doing it in every one? 
[01:09:00]  Maybe she kept the little piece of sample that was left.  I don't know.  You know, I was reading this.  You guys are trying to figure out how he got caught?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  He was extremely nervous, this guy.  Garcia denied putting bodily fluids in the yogurt container, which he admitted discarding  in a trash compactor.  And then they went and got the fucking trash.  Ah, they took out the trash.  He should have just fucking kept that, and then said, yeah, I threw it out, and fucking  flushed it. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, you know what?  Imagine if he had to eat the evidence right there.  That would have been a little bitter irony, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  This story left a bad taste in my mouth.  But instead of just, he should have fucking, I guess you don't think that they're going  to come back and you're going to have to say it, but he should have lied and said he threw  it out in another garbage.  What are you doing?  People do that all the time.  You watch a lot of these murder shows like I do.  Oh, God.  People take shit and put it right out in their stupid garbage pail.  Like, evidence of killing someone, and they put it in their own garbage. 
[01:10:00]  Like, the cops aren't going to check.  There's a dead body in the house.  They're not going to check the garbage pail outside, you dummy.  They do it constantly.  It's great.  And then I think you started the Breadman Helmet.  What are we calling him again?  Bread Helmet?  Well, Danny is the, he's pretty much the king of knowing what's hot and what's not on  the internet.  Well, I saw you photoshopping yesterday, because I do check out your Twitter. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  Somebody, Ollie Larner, I guess, Ollie with one L, he's got a photoshop of Bread Helmet  Guy in a Donkey Kong game.  I was thinking about this one?  You were thinking about doing that one.  The photoshops are taking over the world with this guy.  I went high tech and went with, um, it's on my YouTube.  It's on my YouTube.  Yeah, that one is funny.  Melissa did one.  He's throwing a pizza.  He's making pizza.  Oh, that's great.  So he's throwing a big thing of dough in the air. 
[01:11:00]  And I had him holding up Simba on the Lion King.  I saw that one.  That's funny.  With Rafiki's body.  And then, um, I've got the other one I had.  I had another one.  Somebody, though, with the, uh, the platoon, the platoon movie poster's great.  And then, uh, yeah, that's the little Lion King.  Yeah, that's funny.  Uh, but then the, the, uh, YMCA one took a little bit of work.  Oh, yeah, the touchdown.  I didn't see that one yet. 
[01:11:30]  Touchdown.  YMCA?  I didn't see the YMCA one yet.  Oh, okay.  You must have done it.  Crank it up.  You gotta see the music.  You gotta have the music with it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's, uh, this, this, I think it actually kind of moves around.  It's fun to stay at the YMCA.  Oh, my God.  It's creepy.  YMCA.  The end is awful.  YMCA.  Yeah, well, I can only do so much. 
[01:12:00]  Well, you know.  That's pretty good, though, man.  People love Breadhead.  Breadhead YMCA rules.  Breadhead YMCA on YouTube.  That's on my YouTube.  Where is mine?  Mine is, uh...  O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  Do you think once, once that, once you start getting cartooned and parodied, all of a sudden  that the rebellion is just, no one cares about it.  It's done.  That was another, like, point.  When you saw the tease, news teases for teen sexting and car crashes and shit, and Egypt  wasn't even on the news today, then you realize, like, oh, okay, the story is really 
[01:12:30]  dying down.  But when they get a figurehead, like, bread helmet guy, and it's the new internet sensation  like Moshing Girl was, and fucking, uh, the, the looter, the Heineken looter.  Who was Moshing Girl?  Moshing Girl was the greatest fucking...  I forgot about her.  Yeah, I know.  I remember...  She was in everything.  I forgot about her.  I love Moshing Girl.  She ruled.  I forgot all about her.  She was in every fucking thing.  Would they put Moshing Girl in different things?  Oh, she would, she'd end up in everything. 
[01:13:00]  She was awful.  And then a guy, guy projectile vomiting out of his nose and mouth was fantastic.  All right.  Moshing Girl rules.  Okay.  Remember we were figuring out the Bobo bit?  Yes.  Let me go to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Hey, I got the ultimate Bobo bread head challenge.  All right.  Yeah, we're trying to get a bread helmet thing going with Bobo.  We really want to throw oranges and rocks at his head.  Yeah, that would be fun to just throw rocks at him.  But Jimmy is the voice of reason, unfortunately, because we really want to do this one. 
[01:13:30]  We get in Dutch.  I'll go ahead, Bill.  Put the bread helmet on him and turn him out and let the pigeons attack him.  Dude.  Oh, let's see.  Birds?  I just filmed a pigeon guy literally last week rolling.  I know where to go to do this.  You mean like they would really come to...  Fuck yeah.  If we put a bread helmet on Bobo and walked him, it's a...  I don't want to say where...  That doesn't matter.  Dude, you give him goggles, like welding goggles, so his eyes don't get hurt.  The pigeons would go nuts.  They would just go for the bread. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, but they'd be all over his dumb head.  That's okay.  They ain't going to hurt you.  No, they're just pigeons.  They're pigeons.  I could film it today if Bobo could get his ass in.  And where do we get a bread helmet from?  You got to make one.  I don't feel like making one.  We got to get one of those big fucking bread bowls.  You got to get a big bread thing.  A bread bowl.  Bread bowl like they serve soup in.  You know how disappointed the birds will be when they see where the bread is?  That'd be like us finding a pizza on a pile of shit.  And he wears glasses, right?  Yeah, but you got to get him some welding glasses. 
[01:14:30]  Fuck that.  The glasses are good enough.  Protect his eyes.  Get him safety goggles.  Fuck that.  Like the birds.  He ends up with his eyes plucked out.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Look at that asshole.  Anything for the show.  If that asshole could get here by 10, I'll do it today.  But we need a bread bowl.  Yeah.  And I know exactly where to go.  I literally just filmed Pigeon Man last week.  How about a marble rye?  A marble rye?  You old bag.  That's the bit, though.  Yeah.  My Pigeon area is good.  Is there another good Pigeon area in Manhattan I don't know about?  I have no idea. 
[01:15:00]  I know where the horse and carriages go.  That's pretty good, too.  I don't know.  Pigeons don't really fuck with you, though, right?  They're aggressive, though.  They'll be right in your face.  They're not afraid of people.  Yeah, but they're not vicious where they'll start plucking your eyes out.  No.  Especially if there's bread on your head.  You swatted them.  Yeah.  So get out of here.  I like that idea.  I like it, too.  I like your video.  The YMCA definitely is...  Ah, it was, you know, a quick little After Effects thingy.  I love that program rules. 
[01:15:30]  Hey, got a little kid that loves his Yankee Candles.  I didn't forget Danny.  Oh, Yankee Candle Kid.  I didn't forget Danny.  Danny brought this to us a couple days ago.  Yeah, he's just a YouTube kid just loving his Yankee Candles.  Do you like the Yankee Candles?  You know what?  I am a sucker for candles.  Can I tell you something?  Ange gets candles for me all the time.  The nice ones like Vanilla and Christmas.  There was like Christmassy ones in the glass. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And then you light them up all over the house.  Oh, I love a good candle.  But you don't smell them.  No, you do.  You only smell them when you go, oh, this smells good.  But every time you light those stupid things, they never smell like that.  The ones I got at my house, they smell great.  You put them in the bathrooms.  Yeah.  You light them up when you're having a party or something like that.  Yeah, those are the kind I get.  And the glass.  Dune grass.  Yeah, those are great.  Dune grass rules.  Dune grass is great.  If you like the beach, fuck yeah.  I love the beach.  I'm a beach guy. 
[01:16:30]  Smells like the beach.  Well, then you know what you do.  You got to get sun and sand and you get dune grass and then you burn them together.  That's great.  Nice.  You could be really gay.  A blend.  Really gay.  I got to tell you something, man.  Jennifer Aniston's cologne or perfume, I guess, because it's a woman.  Smell like reeky pussy.  No.  Holy shit, does it smell good.  It's good?  Holy mother of God.  Well, it has to cover up a world of hurt, so I guess they had to make it really good.  Oh, you know what?  If you don't mind, I'm going to be self-serving for a second. 
[01:17:00]  Someone sent me a picture yesterday on Twitter and we did a caption contest, but I want to  show you the picture.  And they're making a million Jennifer Aniston jokes.  Did you see it?  Oh, yeah.  I saw the picture.  Yeah.  You did?  I don't know what that is, though.  What do you mean?  Like, what is it?  What's really happening in that picture?  Go down like, oh, yeah, I just retweeted.  It was sexy.  I just retweeted the Donkey Kong bread helmet guy.  Right there, I guess.  Does it say caption contest?  Oh, no.  What is it?  Oh, that's hilarious, too.  While we're at it, fuck it. 
[01:17:30]  This guy sent me this.  This thing is being retweeted like crazy.  His name's MT on Twitter.  And he retweeted a tweet he got from Mayor Dave Bing.  Where's Mayor Dave Bing?  Bing!  I don't know.  Is it Detroit?  Help me out.  Bing.  Detroit.  Okay, it is Detroit.  Read that tweet, Danny, that MT got back from Mayor Dave Bing.  Just read that.  There are not any plans to erect a statue to RoboCop.  Thank you for the suggestion. 
[01:18:00]  That's a real tweet?  From the mayor?  From the mayor?  Why would he have to answer that?  How great is that?  Why would he even have to answer that?  I don't know.  It's fantastic.  How funny is that?  All right.  That was like the last good thing to come out of Detroit.  Right.  The tweet.  But give me the picture.  It's the one after that.  Oops.  That's a good one.  What's happening?  Just get rid of that.  It says caption contest.  Two more.  Right?  Yeah, right there.  You got it.  Where?  Uh-oh. 
[01:18:30]  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  This picture.  It's obviously a high school girl either at a volleyball game or a basketball game.  Some kind of sporting event.  Yeah, sporting event.  And then you got another chick that's bending down and spraying her crotch.  Spraying her crotch with some kind of aerosol.  Oh, what's that?  Raid?  There's a million Jennifer Aniston jokes going around over this picture.  But like you just said.  But what is it?  What is that?  What are they doing?  What is it?  We got any young teenage girls that want to call and tell us? 
[01:19:00]  Tell us what's a...  Please tell us.  What's that sport?  Because I don't know.  But what is that?  Like, what's wrong with her crotch?  This is the wrong color.  They're spray painting it.  I don't know.  Maybe it's a powder thing.  Maybe she's got a little rash.  She's got like Spanx on or something.  Maybe she's got a rash.  But no.  I mean, our pants aren't down.  She's doing it through the clothes.  What is that?  Was she stinking?  And the girls are like, ah, ha, look.  But the picture's in mid-spray.  She's spraying her good. 
[01:19:30]  You know what?  Anyone know?  Forget it.  I don't know.  It's the question of the day.  We need someone that does high school sports.  That's so great.  That has little boobies.  I would apply that.  Maybe it's a D-louser.  Mouth.  That's great.  She's got her legs spread apart.  And she's holding her shirt up.  She's holding her shirt up.  Like, what the fuck is going on there?  I don't know.  That's so sexy.  The picture rules, but I really want to know what it's about.  I want to learn.  I want to learn as well. 
[01:20:00]  I want to learn.  What is behind her?  What piece of apparatus?  What sport are they playing?  I can't even tell the sport.  It's tough.  It's just a bench and a water bottle.  There's a water bottle.  The socks are up way too high.  It doesn't look like basketball shoes.  Could it be track?  It's inside, though.  Nah, too many clothes for track.  The socks way high gives it away.  Volleyball practice?  Field hockey?  Inside, though?  Well, maybe they're going to go outside.  Soccer?  We say no to soccer?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  Nah, she'd be wearing cleats or something for soccer.  Could be into a practice.  Volleyball?  Maybe volleyball.  Volleyball.  Maybe she got hit in the pussy with a volleyball.  Yes, numbing spray.  And it hurts, and that's like, yeah, numbing spray.  The phone's on the ball.  All right, the phone's on the ball.  So we're going to get the answer in a minute, but we've got to wait.  I hope so.  And Bobo is really tight.  Bobo's on the line going, I'll do it.  Bobo, you've got to be here by 10.  Stop calling the stupid show.  Let's go to Lauren.  Lauren.  Hey, guys. 
[01:21:00]  How are you?  Oh, hello.  I guess we're going to get an answer now.  Did you see my Twitter with this picture?  No, I didn't see the Twitter with the picture.  I'm in the car right now driving.  All right, no worries.  But I guess the girl's kind of sitting down, leaning back, and then another girl's bending  now in an aerosol can, just spraying the shit out of her crotch.  On the outside of her shorts, though.  Right.  Very tight, very tight spandex-y shorts.  Right.  All right, well, basically, it's not just when you're working out or playing sports type 
[01:21:30]  thing, because I'm not in my teens.  I'm in my 20s.  But when I'm at the gym, or if you have a busy day running around, usually it's either  just some sort of good-scented deodorant-type spray, or just a good-scented spray.  Because if you plan on going out afterwards, and you can't grab a quick shower or something,  and you plan on being with somebody, you want to make sure you smell good down there?  On the outside of your pants, though?  Yeah.  She's wearing her sweaty clothes, and wouldn't she do it in the locker room?  When she only has her panties on? 
[01:22:00]  Personally, I wouldn't do it in the middle of a gymnasium, if that's where they are.  I would go into the locker room.  But, yeah, no, you can, honestly, because after, you feel self-conscious.  And it's just like if you check under your arms to see if you smell, and you put your  deodorant on, if you're like, oh, you know what?  Who does that?  A lot of people, you do, you're guilty.  I love when my pits stink.  All right, look at, a bunch of people saying you're wrong, Lauren.  I'm sorry.  Oh, boy.  All right, well, that's what we do.  At least you tried it.  Who is this bitch? 
[01:22:30]  You sound nice, and.  Yeah.  You're just trying to help.  Sounds like you smell nice and all, so.  Yeah.  So we won't beat you up too bad.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Catherine in Jersey.  Catherine.  Hello.  Hey.  How you doing, bitch?  I love hearing from the women.  We actually have them listening.  It's nice.  What's up, Catherine?  Well, I teach in high school, and.  Oh, do you?  They use the hairspray to keep their shorts in place.  So when they're running around playing volleyball, you know, they're spiking or whatever. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, so it's not chafing their thighs?  Right.  Yeah, no, so they don't ride up into their crotch and whatever.  Ah, you know what?  That might be a good answer.  It stiffens up the material.  It maybe adheres a little to the leg.  Right.  I don't know.  Can we tell what that's a can of?  Zoom in.  Enhance.  Enhance.  Enhance.  I think that's hairspray. 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  That's all I got.  All right.  Thanks.  Where are you getting your motherfucking information from, bitch?  And a few people saying static spray.  Let's go to Denise in Jersey.  Static spray.  Denise.  Hey, guys.  How are you today?  How's the nephew?  That's not very funny.  That's the...  What are you talking...  Oh, Denise.  All right.  I was going to say, how are the calves for Denise?  Go ahead. 
[01:24:00]  Dueling chips.  Dueling chips.  Yeah.  You got to think about it.  Is there a lot of black women?  Is that nappy...  Boo!  Sorry.  What were you saying?  It's not a black girl.  It's a...  It's a white girl.  It's a young, supple white girl.  No, it's static guard.  Because that shit gets all staticky, especially when you get chub rub.  You know...  Well, you get what?  Chub rub.  What's that?  Chub rub.  When the inner thighs rub together.  Oh, well, these are athletic girls.  So, athletic girls, no. 
[01:24:30]  It's some kind of static guard, some kind of thing that keeps everything in place so it's  not rubbing the shorts off.  Maybe it is some kind of static thing, because then when they...  Because that spandex kind of works up that charge, and maybe the shirt sticks to it  and makes you feel all silly.  You ever have a static pussy?  No.  What?  How does that happen?  I don't know.  Oh.  But it does seem good on the men's of ghosts when you spray it.  But this girl is really spraying right where the clit is, if I...  It's... 
[01:25:00]  No, it looks like it's on the thigh.  I gotta be honest.  Really?  It doesn't look directly on the crotch.  Danny, where's the...  Oh, yeah, okay.  It looks like it's hitting the thigh.  It's the way upper right thigh that's getting hit.  You're right.  But the bounce off is making it look like it's...  Yeah, that's what it is.  She might be going like this, and you just caught that...  Right.  Who's on the phone?  What's her name?  It is provocative.  Denise.  Okay.  North Jersey.  I don't care where you're from, bitch.  Why is she spraying the pussy?  Quickly. 
[01:25:30]  I'm bummed we got the answer, because there's so many girls we could just talk to.  When's Jimmy coming back to Jersey?  When's he going to...  Soon.  Jimmy.  March 5th, Montclair.  Montclair.  It's coming soon.  Montclair.  Montclair, right?  Yes, madam.  Awesome.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Let me go to Tom in Hillside.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  You're out, Tom.  What's up, Tom?  Oh, man.  I'm surprised you're not plugging your Twitter from yesterday, the pumpkin lady. 
[01:26:00]  That was a throwaway video.  I don't plug all my videos.  It was just a throwaway video.  I saw a girl with a fucking oversized, really orange jacket, and I don't know.  We filmed her for a minute.  It was hilarious.  Oh, you liked it?  I appreciate that.  Absolutely.  All right.  All right, boys.  Have a good day.  Thank you, Tom.  You have a good day, sir.  Tom in Hillside.  Tom.  Yankee Candle Guy.  Want to do it after the break? 
[01:26:30]  Let's do that.  I don't know.  Okay.  Why not?  So we got a kid that loves his Yankee Candles.  Is he gay?  It's a kid that loves his Yankee Candles.  Yeah.  Well, does he like the way they smell or the way they feel?  He's a little...  Long, thin ones.  He's a little too young to be enjoying Yankee Candles this much.  I just see the first frame of the video of him, and I'm saying this could be a little  femme problem here.  You think you're born with the gay?  Yeah.  Yes.  I absolutely think you're born with the gay, but I do think there's a few people that fall 
[01:27:00]  into it.  That do a little gay.  That do it because they either want attention or they think that they'd be better in that  community, better suited.  But that's like fake gay.  But most people just born with the gay.  I think true, honest gay people are born gay.  Yeah.  Like, when I was growing up, I didn't really talk about Yankee Candles like this kid's  about to talk about.  No.  He's ready to roll on Yankee Candles, huh?  Yeah.  No, because there are kids that are like, you know, like fucking four or five years old, 
[01:27:30]  and you're like, that kid is a femme.  Yeah.  That kid is a femme-y kid.  Yeah, when I...  I told the story a million times.  My nephew with the baseball.  You know, he's been playing baseball since he was...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was basically out of the womb.  He was one of those kids.  They needed to get him on the baseball field immediately.  And you just saw some of these kids and you just knew.  Better suited for ballet, huh?  Some of those kids.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe floral arrangements or interior decorating. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, whatever.  How about that?  Whatever makes him happy.  Window treatments.  Whatever makes him happy.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it's all just about the kid being able to be himself.  I do want to acknowledge...  No bullying, people.  No bullying, please.  Coke Logic caught me red-handed, so I do have to read this.  Oh, by talking about not plugging your Twitter video, didn't you just plug your Twitter video?  And then he writes Radio Genius. 
[01:28:30]  You caught me red-handed, Coke Logic.  It wasn't that hard to catch.  It's like one of Jimmy's plugs.  Oh, please.  Oh, please.  I'm not going to mention the fact that I'll be at...  But I don't.  I know you don't.  I'm not talking about that right now.  I didn't even know that's why you called the show.  You caught me so bad.  Bravo, sir.  All right.  Yankee Candle Kid next.  Stay there.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. Anthony. 
[01:29:00]  Entering the studio, Bob Kelly, everyone.  Bobby.  What's up, Bobby?  Hey.  Robert.  What I loved about the break, Jimmy and Bobby are outside the studio trying to figure out  what holds Frank Shamrock and Fedor should put Jimmy in.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Jimmy's insane for doing this.  I look forward to it, but I don't...  No one looks forward to that.  Looking for punishment.  But it's not like I want to do it like a... 
[01:29:30]  Like Jason Ellis is a different vibe.  Jason's like a guy who practices and stuff, and he's like, ah, kick me.  He'll take like a full kick in the leg.  Yeah, I don't want to do that.  He wants to do a triangle, which means he has to put his face directly in Fedor's ball  sack.  Oh, well, there's a plus.  Well, just above it.  His chin would be resting on his cock tip and sack.  Oh, God.  So you're going triangle with Fedor?  Maybe.  If he wants to do that.  He may not want to lie on the floor.  He may want to just do one standing up with his arm.  Yeah, but it's got to be different than the other three.  Oh, I agree.  You've done Randy Couture, Gonzalez, and BJ Penn. 
[01:30:00]  Thank you, E-Rock.  No, it wasn't Gonzalez.  It was Cain Velasquez.  Oh, Velasquez.  I'm sorry.  Guillotine choke with Velasquez.  Just a regular choke with Couture.  Right.  And armbar with BJ Penn.  I should go for something with the leg.  But BJ was...  That was fluid.  The armbar was my favorite so far.  Although you did make a good sound when you were being choked.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  That was a good one.  We're going to get two new ones today.  Because Frank Shamrock certainly hurt people still.  He should have Frank do an omoplata. 
[01:30:30]  What's an omoplata?  Someone who puts his shin over the front of his neck and chokes you out.  Here's the Randy Couture.  Let's phrase this properly.  Here's the Randy Couture.  Who spelled that?  I did.  Oh, Jesus.  But I pointed out that I fucked it up.  Oh, you put an E in there?  Yeah.  You ever choke a clam?  Use that.  Randy Couture.  Choking out from North.  Oh, God.  The video is twisted. 
[01:31:00]  There's a wind choke.  Wind chokes are actually very painful.  You don't want it again.  You have a soup choke.  Crushes, crushes.  Because you'll take it.  Choke a clam.  That's brilliant.  He's controlling me with his finger.  How do you choke?  He's standing behind me putting his fingers on my neck.  He's checking to see if you're done.  Fucking Patrice.  I've got my bicep on one carotid and my forearm on the other.  Okay.  And now if I apply.  Wow. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Slow motion.  There it is.  So we're going to add to the collection today.  I've never seen Jimmy come so fast.  That sound is like...  I think they both hurt badly, but Cain's was awful.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  That fucking...  That guillotine choke is a horrible fucking hole to be put in.  Yeah, that's bad.  Yeah, they're up there.  We got three of them.  Oh, terrible.  I think the BJ Penn was the one that was the worst.  This one was bad.  Velasquez with the guillotine.  Yeah.  Or if I'm on the ground, I'm trying to get up somehow.  I'm going to have to retweet all these today again.  Oh, he's strong.  This is basically this.  Let's try that just for a second.  But I need a second.  Do you have a safe word, Jimmy?  Yeah, ouch.  Okay.  You won't be able to talk. 
[01:32:30]  Okay.  Here we go.  Okay.  Jimmy looks nervous.  Here it is.  And...  Jesus.  I love how quickly you tap.  But did you see me test the distance for tapping?  I actually put my arm up to his arm to see I could get my arm up there.  He put you in the best choke right there.  And you said you're looking forward to this today.  Yes.  It's funny because you don't get a chance.  How many guys get to be put in those holes by champions?  That's true.  That's true.  This is the BJ Penn in the arm bar. 
[01:33:00]  I have wanted to ask a UFC guy this for a long time.  Damn, it's got 80,000 views.  I like the BJ Penn one, huh?  Holy shit.  This is so...  These always make the MMA sites.  Yeah.  Yeah, they love them.  I'll retweet all these for everybody today.  I'll choke a clam.  I'll choke a clam.  No, don't make it real, Jimmy.  Come on.  No pressure on it.  No pressure, I mean.  BJ.  I don't know what that feels like.  Lock it in.  BJ had just lost, too.  A little pressure.  Yeah, he wasn't happy.  So, you know, sitting in the seat, he does this to Jimmy with his leg. 
[01:33:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Across his neck.  Holy...  All right, he's tapping.  He taps right away.  He taps like a hummingbird's wing.  That, dude, it hurt because it pulls you from...  I didn't realize you got pulled apart.  I knew one arm got pulled, but I was being stretched both ways.  That was a hideous feeling.  Hideous feeling.  Does it just feel like your rib cage is going to open up?  Hideous feeling.  Fuck that.  All right, you're going to do two new ones today.  Yes, I will.  The guys will be in soon.  Fedor and Frank Shamrock.  Someone said to do an ankle one. 
[01:34:00]  That's ankle lock.  Oh, shit.  Do a knee bar.  What's a knee bar?  A knee bar is he grabs your ankle and twists your knee off.  Oh, shit.  Fuck that.  That's a good one.  All right.  I mean, whatever one he wants to do.  We'll see his little hand with a tap.  I'd love to hear him go, oh, my knee.  Oh, my knee, dude.  Oh, my knee, dude.  Yeah, that looks...  Is that Shamrock?  Frank Shamrock knee bar.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  Oh, my God.  Fucking no way.  This guy's fine right here. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, he's fine right there.  He's fine right there.  Until you knee him in the...  Yeah, that guy's fucking on the mat.  He knows how to twist his leg like that.  Get the back of his heel in the guy's asshole.  That would just hurt.  Yeah, you put your heel in his asshole.  Someone's got a hold suggestion for him.  It's like heaven and hell.  Let me try this.  Maybe Shane in Toronto has a hold idea.  Shane.  Hi, Shane.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  If you want for Fedor, maybe go with an anaconda choke.  An anaconda?  Would you go for an anaconda choke? 
[01:35:00]  Never.  Is that where he lays on his back and just puts his forearm around?  Because he is...  They did a test on him on some discovery on how strong he is when he chokes.  And they were comparing...  I think there was a guillotine or arena choke, but the anaconda choke is a pretty cool choke.  You can do it from a lot of different positions.  The one that Bobby was talking about is actually called a go-go platen.  I don't know how much platen.  Sorry, dude.  Thanks.  A go-go platen.  Can I ask you something, Shane?  Because obviously you know this shit.  We want one that looks really good on video and one that will really hurt Jimmy, even though 
[01:35:30]  it's a half a second.  Pretty much any of those holes are going to hurt him.  Yeah.  What?  You've never done a shoulder attack, Jimmy.  You can do a Kimura.  That's where he's going to...  It's also called a key lock.  Frank will do it for you.  But Fedor...  I mean, for Fedor, you've got to go with the choke.  Fedor's not going to lie down.  He typically doesn't do a lot of triangle chokes and stuff like that.  Okay.  So you want to go with like an Anaconda or a Darce choke.  I mean, those...  Darce choke is good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Jones. 
[01:36:00]  Jones did a Darce choke.  I don't like chokes.  It's my neck.  I have a little neck.  Yeah, yeah.  Watch this happen to the people's elbow.  The people's elbow.  What's that?  I like that.  It's the rock.  It's a wrestling thing.  Oh, God.  The rock, yes, of course.  This is the...  Vince McMahon was trending yesterday on Twitter, Ant.  Our old pal Vince McMahon.  I don't know.  Maybe Sam can tell us.  He's got something going on.  When's WrestleMania?  I heard that Chris Jericho had a funny line.  I don't want to fucking wreck it, so Sam, I'm sure he watches every wrestling show. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, please.  Of course he does.  He's Mr. Wrestling.  What is this thing?  He has his shin in the front of his neck and his foot on the back of his neck.  Oh, God.  And he chokes him out that way with his...  He's choking him out with his shin.  Yeah.  Oh, that guy hit the mat like a sack of potatoes.  Sam, why was Vince McMahon trending yesterday?  Because they announced on Twitter right before Raw that Vince McMahon was going to return to TV last night.  Where has he been these days? 
[01:37:00]  Was he injured?  Did his limo blow up?  Yeah.  Did the light fall on him?  Did he run into a Botox needle?  No, the Nexus had taken him out.  Wait, wait, what?  The Nexus had taken him out.  What is this?  It's a faction of rebels.  Oh, okay.  How'd they take him out?  They beat him down.  But hasn't he just been beat down a thousand times before?  But they all did their finishing moves to him, and there was like five of them.  Yeah, but hasn't this happened to Vince?  No, there was too many of them. 
[01:37:30]  And then where did he go?  The hospital, I guess.  So they knew where he was.  Yeah, but he wasn't on TV.  He didn't come back to the arena.  Do you really think he was in the hospital?  Must have been.  I hate talking wrestling with Sam, because he's such an innocent little boy.  Well, where else would he be?  Well, he probably was on vacation.  Well, I think Linda had something to do with it.  Look, I'm trying to become a politician, so could you stop with your silly wrestling shit for six months and give me a shot at this? 
[01:38:00]  He let the anonymous Raw general manager take care of the powers.  Anonymous.  He controls via email.  Okay.  Oh, via email.  Yes.  Oh, that's good.  The laptop goes off, you know.  Oh, yeah.  What did Chris Jericho say yesterday?  You didn't watch Raw last night?  Chris Jericho.  I heard he was in the ring with Vince McMahon, and Chris Jericho was basically saying that, you know, he hates MMA.  And then Vince said something like, we're trying to get Brock Lesnar for WrestleMania. 
[01:38:30]  And then all of a sudden, Chris Jericho said, oh, I love MMA.  No, I didn't see that.  Did you see the whole show?  No.  Oh, what the hell was more important than that?  Are you growing up?  That was the big moment last night.  What are you doing?  I wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning, so I fell asleep.  You actually just went to bed?  Oh.  I mean, the TV was on, but my eyes were shut.  Someone's had enough of wrestling.  No, no, no, no.  I haven't had enough of wrestling.  I've had enough of him.  Oh, you're growing up, Sam.  Vince is getting old.  Well, shit, he's been at this since I was a kid. 
[01:39:00]  It's like getting a little chubby.  No, he came out last night, and he said that next week he was going to make an announcement.  And what is that going to be?  Next week he's going to announce who the guest host of WrestleMania is going to be.  They got Lesnar.  Because Lesnar doesn't have to wrestle.  If he's the guest host, he doesn't have to wrestle.  But he's got to make it look like it.  Like, I bet people slide in the ring, and he goes, like, into position to wrestle, and  then other people come out and start beating up those people.  Dana won't let him do that.  I don't think it'll be Brock.  Cross promotion, though.  No way.  I think Dana would allow him if he doesn't wrestle. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, maybe, yeah.  Because they get a lot of celebrities for WrestleMania.  But Brock Lesnar is not, like, a strong, like, mic guy.  So if he has to go out there and host something, he's not.  Oh, I see.  Who are you thinking?  A Hulkster?  I made a Twitter suggestion.  I saw you.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  I don't think that's going to happen, primetime.  Well, I think it would be a good fit.  Well, I don't think you're a known commodity.  He said it's like a celebrity, somebody who really can, you know, light up a crowd, something 
[01:40:00]  like that.  And I said, that's...  Where does your description come in?  I mean, you're a zilch who puts people to sleep.  There's been rumors of Bieber doing something at WrestleMania this year.  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck yeah.  There's only one thing I want to see him do at WrestleMania, get his ass kicked by a shitload  of large men, and then get ass raped by them.  It's family programming.  Lucky Justin.  When is this WrestleMania?  It's March.  I don't know.  And he also came out, he was in Wisconsin, you know, not in Green Bay, but he was in 
[01:40:30]  Wisconsin, and he proclaimed that there was only, he said, congratulations for the Super  Bowl.  There's only one event that's bigger than the Super Bowl, and that, of course, is WrestleMania.  Do you think WrestleMania will have 111 million viewers?  Approximately.  Approximately.  Approximately.  What was the biggest audience for WrestleMania, and what year?  I mean, I don't know the pay-per-view numbers.  I know that, you know, they've sold 90,000 seat arenas out, but I don't know what the 
[01:41:00]  biggest...  Well, that's close to 111 million.  Well, they don't have arenas that seat 111 million yet.  You ought to build one.  I don't know what the biggest...  One big arena.  Go to Anthony's house.  Go to my arena.  Just have it in his backyard.  Pay-per-view versus network.  I mean, the numbers are going to be different.  Well, whatever.  It's not as popular, I guess.  People aren't willing to make the commitment to fucking buy it.  I mean, I think it's close to 111 million, is what I'm saying.  Ah, okay.  But I'm saying if it's a little bit off. 
[01:41:30]  Largest audience?  Have you gotten that one yet?  Yeah, well...  Trav Doggy?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Are you saying, oh, boy, because Travis is on this?  Danny would have had it, probably.  You should watch wrestling.  I know.  That's what we're trying to figure out.  How many?  Because...  All right, well, as we get that info, you want the Yankee Candle, kid?  Ah, I got to hear this little...  Because we got the guys coming in in about 15 minutes, so we should get this out of the  way.  Maybe do a little break, because then we could get Jimmy into his holds and stuff.  I don't want to.  And talk to Fedor and Frank Shamrock. 
[01:42:00]  Biggest audience was Madison Square Garden.  Biggest, greatest.  How much is...  Wrestlemania.  How much is a pay-per-view?  Shut up, you piss yourself, you old man.  It's like 50 bucks for Wrestlemania.  Okay.  So, the last one was 52 million.  What?  Dollars.  A little remember.  Oh, oh.  So...  Oh, I thought...  52 million divided by 50.  So, that's about a mil.  It's doing a mil on people at home.  Well, that's close.  So, yeah, around a million.  Only a hundred and a nine or ten more.  That's probably domestic. 
[01:42:30]  Well, so is the Super Bowl.  We're talking globally.  All right.  You always have an answer for them.  Yeah, I mean, you sure want that gig.  Is it coming back now, or is it a downfall?  I mean, last time I watched it, it was a small arena.  Like, you could hear the rednecks talking.  No, that was...  That's the other one.  What's the other one?  They're having a tough time.  TNA?  TNA.  Yeah, you could...  I mean, yeah.  TNA was having a tough time.  They record in a TV studio still.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, it's weird, man.  Like, you know, you can hear the people on the top row yelling shit. 
[01:43:00]  They can't get venues?  Like, TNA, no.  And it's all the ex-really big wrestling stars, which makes it very awkward.  Jake the Snake Roberts?  No.  Is he related, by the way?  To me?  Yeah.  I wish he was.  I used to tell people in grade school that he was my uncle.  And they believed you?  Ew.  No, nobody did.  That's too bad.  Here's Yankee Candle Kid.  Did you see this yet, Bobby?  No, I haven't seen it.  There's a kid, I don't know how old he is.  He's probably about 12, maybe.  He's 11 and a half.  11 and a half.  Aw. 
[01:43:30]  And he loves his Yankee Candles, and he couldn't wait to tell the world.  Hey, guys.  Today's going to be another Yankee Candle haul.  I just went to Yankee Candle today.  Okay.  And I decided to buy a lot of stuff.  Already?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm just feeling there's something very feminine, very effeminate going on with this boy, this  young lad.  And he's into candles.  I decided to buy a lot of stuff.  First thing that I'm going to show you are my large drawers.  First one I got was Pink Lady Slipper. 
[01:44:00]  And that's cast on...  Pink Lady what?  The first one he got was Pink Lady Slipper.  Slipper.  What the fuck is that?  Oh, is that him?  Is that him?  Oh, jeez.  No, that's not him.  No, that's another kid.  That is a real gay...  Oh, wait.  Maybe it is.  I'm glad there's one.  Go ahead and haul them since these videos seem to be...  Oh, wow.  That could be the most foaming game.  The first one was a repurchase. 
[01:44:30]  Is it the same kid growing up?  No, it's a different kid.  All right.  Let's listen to the first kid.  Oh, God.  I didn't know this was a phenomenon.  Wow, is he gay.  He thought it was Pink Lady Slipper.  And that's cast under the floral section.  I love it.  It smells mostly like baby powder and flowers.  I really like it.  If you smell...  I like that smell, too.  It smells like that, but it has a little bit more baby powder. 
[01:45:00]  And if you bought any of that, which is $24.99, you got a second one 50% off.  Wow.  So it was early sunrise I got, which is under the fresh.  And I don't...  Does his mom work for Yankee Candle?  I don't know, but if you listen real close, you could hear his father weeping in the other  room, just crying his eyes out, saying, why, why, why?  And I told everyone, if my son was gay, I wouldn't care. 
[01:45:30]  I wouldn't care as long as you know he's healthy and I love him.  Jesus, could you fucking just play baseball one day, please?  Did you walk it in to your son and he's doing this video?  He's doing a podcast.  You would hope that he's jacking it to some fucking, like, really good porn, and you walk  in and he's doing a little podcast for candles.  I'd rather have him walk in and have him jacking off his friend, at least trying to learn about  his cock.  Oh, poor kid.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's a little fatty bumble-addy, too.  He is.  He's a little chubby.  Fresh. 
[01:46:00]  And I don't know how to describe this.  It smells like outside.  I really like it.  And that was one transaction.  Is it a foot thing falling on his foot?  Oh, this is also my transaction.  Sage and citrus.  I've heard a lot of reviews on this, and I wasn't too fond of it when I tried it.  It's a very strong scent.  So I only got it in this.  Like man-ass.  I didn't want to buy it in a four-hour yet because I'm not positive if I like it or not.  It's pretty strong. 
[01:46:30]  Has more of a sage scent than citrus.  Ah.  So when I bought that, they asked me-  Is he maybe-  Oh, shit.  He's putting the candles back down.  What the fuck?  Is his microphone laying on the table?  Yankee candles are heavy.  You're mad about his audio setup.  I don't like the sound quality.  It's a fucking kid in a blue room with 98 candles.  Leave him alone.  Does he finish up with one candle, one jar?  I want to see if he can take that in. 
[01:47:00]  They asked me if I wanted a teddy bear, and of course, I said yes.  He is really infused with soft blanket a lot, and I really like it.  My soft blanket candle I just bought, it shattered.  And I don't have the receipt anymore, so I have to return that to the store.  So I was pretty upset.  This is all he talks about, I bet.  He's what a lonely boy.  At the dinner table, he's just like,  Father, you know what I picked up today?  Another Yankee candle.  There's no dad in this relationship. 
[01:47:30]  It's a single fat mom that adopts cats.  You think that's it?  Yeah.  She's just a single fat mom, and they hang out way too much,  and they're too good of friends.  Like him and his mom are best friends.  Best friends.  And they do everything together.  This lonely asshole, he gets picked on, he has no friends.  He comes home, Mom, guess what?  And they hang out and talk, and they hug each other.  She probably kisses him too long.  Kisses him too long.  She tells him how, don't worry about the kids at school,  because he's so much more special than they are. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, she lies to him every day.  Yeah, has to lie to him like that every day about how special he is.  And he grabbed onto candles, because his mom one day said,  you know, candles are my favorite thing.  So he just latched onto that.  And now him and his mom have something in common.  You think they watch TV together in the living room,  and he just like rubs her leg a little bit?  Yeah, absolutely.  No, my neck hurts working.  Oh, and he breaks out a little massager from Brookstones.  One of those that look like a dildo. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, there's no table either.  They have like TV trays.  Just sitting in front of the TV all the time.  That's all they do.  And then they probably eat a pint of ice cream each.  Yeah.  And she's like, this is good.  This makes you feel good.  This is our happy time.  Lights the candles, and then he eats like a whole thing of Haagen-Dazs each.  That's why they're fat.  We have to go to Kevin.  Kevin, go ahead.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, I think Anthony's got this all wrong.  You guys are approaching it the wrong way. 
[01:49:00]  There's two fathers in the other room,  and they're probably bumping dickheads.  Oh, you think it's one of those double...  What is this?  The video's just called Midget Stabs Man and the Testicles with a Fork?  I just...  The gay candle kid ended, and this started.  Why?  Oh, Christ, this stupid music.  You got a midget.  This midget had a fork, and he just stabbed some guy in the ass.  Yeah, that's not in the testicles, or does he go testicles too?  No, he goes uppercut to the testicles. 
[01:49:30]  That is one angry midget.  Well, wouldn't you be angry?  Is that really a midget?  I like a Steve Perry from Journey hair.  Yeah.  Not a midget.  Isn't that a dwarf?  Well, they're all midgets.  That's something from Middle Earth.  There is a thing where it's all-encompassing, like midget.  Midget is dwarf.  It takes care of all categories, yep.  Little people.  You're right.  Whatever it is, it wasn't met with tears of joy in the delivery room. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  Probably was, and they didn't know until, like, it was two.  Not growing at all.  Oh, look at this little kid, the six-year-old.  Darth Vader kid?  Is he just playing a video game while they interview his mom on CNN?  Yeah.  Oh, no, he's working on an iPad, it looks like.  That's because he's got some kind of congenital heart problem or something.  No.  Yeah.  That cute little kid has a shitty heart?  That's what I heard.  Oh, fuck.  He met James Earl Jones from CNN.  I didn't know that.  And, of course, Darth Vader's voice. 
[01:50:30]  And, yeah, I think he might have some kind of little heart problem.  Oh, Christ.  What are you going to do?  I think that's why he's getting so much press.  Of course.  You couldn't even see him in the commercial.  Well, now.  What the hell does it matter?  Now he's a big star.  He looks like one of the Lawrence kids.  Yeah, yeah.  He has that Joey, what was it?  Joey, little Joey Lawrence look when little Joey Lawrence was little Joey Lawrence.  Right.  Before he was, whoa.  Or the little kid on Eight is Enough before. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Adam Rich.  Adam Rich before he went bad with all sorts of things.  Yeah, he's got that little raggedy mop-top hair that those kids have.  That's what the little Darth Vader kid has.  Are they up or are they downstairs?  You want to break real quick?  Yeah, we should break.  We've got Fedor and Frank Shamrock coming in.  Also got Bob Kelly.  Bobby, what are we promoting today?  Anything?  I'm at the Palace Theater in Albany Saturday night for a big Valentine's regalia.  Nice.  This Saturday night, Palace Theater.  The Virus. 
[01:51:30]  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  We've got to turn on every microphone in the studio.  We've got like 20 people outside the studio.  We've got Fedor coming into the OPN Anthony Show.  Oh, Frank Shamrock.  Yeah, Frank.  Right on.  What's up, Frank?  Amazing.  Fedor, what's going on, brother?  Hello.  It's been a while.  And, Frank, we've got to put Fedor's translator here. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, hi.  How are you?  If you could sit up there.  You're translating today.  I do so.  Okay, good, good, good.  I'll translate for Fedor.  You can translate, Frank.  It just sounds like this.  Die.  Yeah.  Oh, done.  And you're out.  I hear people getting hit and pain.  The sound of pain.  We also have Showtime in studio, I believe.  And Bob Kelly, we've got a packed house.  Bobby, very big fan.  Very big fan, Bob Kelly.  Huge fan, yeah.  Huge fan.  He's good size.  He's good size.  What are you guys shooting a documentary? 
[01:52:30]  Would you say I have a good size?  I don't know if he's the biggest fan, but he's a good size.  Lower her seat, Sam.  What are you doing?  Come on, Sam, please.  Come on, Sam.  Fix the interpreter's seat.  What happened?  This is the one that doesn't lower.  Oh.  That would just be mean to her.  Give me that seat, and she can have this one.  Please, Sam.  Yeah, Fedor is going to knock you out.  Yeah, he's going to knock someone out.  The seat's too high.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[01:53:00]  She's petting him.  That's never a good sign.  That's not a good sign.  Are you trying to calm him down?  Is he all right?  There you go.  Come on.  Glass.  Glass nose.  Fedor just starts laughing at me.  Is she doing her job, Frank?  I have no clue what to say, bro.  I just smile and nod so Fedor doesn't knock me out, man.  Stolich Schneier.  What's that mean?  I don't know.  You should find out.  Anthony, be careful.  I think it's vodka.  Why are you just trying freaking Russian out? 
[01:53:30]  Are you all right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Okay.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Thank you.  I would love having you here.  Big fans.  Yeah.  It's been a couple years.  Yeah.  Big fans of watching you beat people up.  We can have you.  He doesn't need the headphones.  We can have you on that mic, though, so the audience can hear what you're saying, too,  when you translate for them.  Do you want them to hear my Russian as well?  Oh, yeah.  You back off when you're doing the Russian.  I want to pick up a little Russian.  And then you do the English for everybody so we know what Fedor is saying. 
[01:54:00]  That's good that she actually asked that.  Most times, you know, the Brazilian interpreters make you sit through both.  It just takes 12 hours.  Brutal.  He doesn't need them if he doesn't want to wear them.  Whatever he wants.  We don't want to upset him.  It's like talking to Francois Truffaut in Close Encounters.  From behind here, Norton and Fedor.  It looks like a little mini Fedor.  You think so?  Yeah.  Like, he looks like a little mini one.  Tell Fedor that he's making fun of him.  No, I'm not making fun of him. 
[01:54:30]  No.  No, no, no.  She just did it.  Lady.  Excuse me, miss.  There's Tanya.  Tanya.  Don't even miss.  Please.  No, no.  Please tell him that we're not happy with this disrespect.  We don't like it.  Listen.  What's her name again?  Frank.  Frank, you need to help me.  I can't help you on this one.  Tanya.  Dude, please don't listen to anything he says.  And Fedor says he will be waiting for you after the show is over.  Okay. 
[01:55:00]  Nice knowing you, bro.  The only way I'll ever get famous.  How can you think it's a compliment?  How can you think it's a compliment to tell Fedor that he looks like me?  There's no fighter that wants to hear that.  I said from the back, not from the front.  That would be an insult.  You don't have a bad back.  You look good.  So we're very happy.  Are you guys doing a documentary to be shown after the fight?  Or what are you filming for?  Well, right now we're shooting a show called Ungloved.  And it's sort of behind the scenes kind of.  I thought it was Jimmy's sex life. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to keep the glove on that one.  I'll do it.  You know what?  We're showing the insides of MMA really from my life and my standpoint.  Because my journey has been just incredible.  So we're just trying to show people what's going on on the inside.  Stuff like this.  Because most people have no clue that we get up and do all this crazy stuff.  Right, right, right.  Fedor knocks out buses and beats up people on the way.  Yeah, knock the bus out on the way over here.  He KO'd a New York City bus.  No, but you're not.  I mean, you're talking like you're a badass, too.  I mean, you still are. 
[01:56:00]  But no, you were a badass son of a bitch in your time, too.  Yeah, yeah.  My days are done.  I saw a video of you getting.  You had Boss Rootin in a knee bar.  And you're actually sticking your tongue out at him.  Oh, man.  Because it was pancreas and you can't close fists.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was palming your face.  Yeah.  And you're laughing, going, aha, and sticking his tongue out.  So he closed his fist and hit you in the face.  It wasn't very smart.  I was younger then.  I was younger then.  That was crazy. 
[01:56:30]  Can I say that Bob's a very knowledgeable MMA guy?  He is.  But I don't like the way he's sitting right now.  It's way too comfortable and kind of sexy.  Dude, I'm on the couch with him.  That's not cool.  I like the fact that he's lounging like they're sipping daiquiris in Hawaii.  I should have more respect.  She's saying everything.  Yeah, she's making sure he knows.  Just got to keep Fedor in and let him know what's being said.  I wanted to...  You finally lost the fight, which, you know, it was a shock for everybody. 
[01:57:00]  What was going through your mind?  And I wondered this right after the fight.  As you tapped, it seemed like you were hesitant to tap.  What was going through your mind as you were tapping?  When you came to the end of the moment, when you were winning, what did you think was in the mind?  In the head, when you were shooting for the ring, what did you think there was in the mind?  What did you think?  I looked at the situation and understood that we need to stop the fight because we didn't want to sleep in the ring. 
[01:57:30]  I understood that it will happen soon or soon.  I'd love for him to just punch you in the face, Jimmy.  But here's what a phony I am. I nodded because I knew what he said. I actually nodded.  I'm so strong. I nodded. I don't speak Russian, but I nodded. 
[01:58:00]  Speaking nothing special, there was nothing special I was thinking about.  I could estimate, evaluate the situation pretty good.  And at the same time, I could realize that I had to stop the fight because, you know, I didn't want to fall asleep.  All right. So, was it, um, do you think that, uh, uh, Verdum, is that how you say his name? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Okay. Do you think that he, he, because Fedor a lot of times would get somebody down and just, just jump on him.  Do you think that he kind of, uh, was waiting for that and, uh, saw a weakness or, or a flaw in, in the style which he was waiting for?  Well, usually, Fedor, at your zoning, you're going to get a man, you're going to get somebody down and you're going to get person, and you're going to see what you were doing?  I understand that Fabrizio decided to make this treatment, and he did it, but I 
[01:59:00]  I was a little hesitant, and I was not very mindful of the being in the right way. 
[01:59:30]  But I think God will, I'll meet again.  I wish I knew this language.  I know.  I got to learn that.  I got to get Rosetta Stone.  Rosetta Stone Russian.  Can I...  Is that how you learned?  No, that's not...  I understand that Fabrizio Verdun was waiting for that very situation  And he was hoping to use that hold  And I understand that I was in a hurry 
[02:00:00]  And I got really very excited  And I was in a hurry, you know, just to finish the hold  And that's why I was not very attentive  Are these Fedor's words or yours?  But hopefully, that's Fedor's words  I thought you were kicking ass  She has no sense of humor  Yeah, why no sense of humor?  No, I wish you could be in my place, actually  You guys are all going to get your asses kicked  So, if it's God's will, we'll meet each other once again  Okay, so he would fight him  Because I noticed, it seems like in the last few fights 
[02:00:30]  Are you wrestling less and kind of relying on the big punch  Which you normally do land  But there's been times where I was surprised  That you didn't take somebody to the ground  When you definitely could have  Are you finding it more  That you just want to wait for the big strike?  I mean, sometimes I'm surprised  That you don't try to put it  You're more likely to put it  You're more likely to put it  No, just my opponents  They don't really want to go to the parter  And they want to stay in the same way 
[02:01:00]  So, in principle, I'm not against  I don't want to fight  That's not me  These are my opponents  Who are not eager to continue the fight on the ground  So, they want to stay  You know, just to be standing as long as they can  So, that's why I continue  Actually, you know, just fighting  Standing  Okay  Do you feel a certain amount of pressure?  I mean, there's always pressure  But coming off a loss for the first time 
[02:01:30]  Do you feel a little extra motivation  To win this one?  I don't feel any pressure  No pressure?  He doesn't seem like he gets very nervous  So, at the moment, I don't have the reason for that  I've been working out a lot  I tell him I do a little bit  About 45 minutes on the elliptical machine  But it's not doing quite what I want it to do 
[02:02:00]  Does he have any suggestions?  But you've got to turn it on  And stop eating on it  How do I build abs without doing sit-ups?  I don't want to do sit-ups  Sit-ups  Crunches  What would you say are  Sit-ups  Yeah, but she's asked what sit-ups are  Abs  Yeah  How do I build my stomach without doing  Without blowing guys? 
[02:02:30]  So, you need to eat less  I was hoping there was like a really good Russian secret  Like lots of cake and sleep  You need to eat less  You should wish for something like in your DNA  Like Scrabble  When you could just say  I got no good letters  Can I just get all new ones?  That's like your genetics  Jimmy  She's translated that  That's scary 
[02:03:00]  What part of  I would ask Frank this as well  As Fedor  What part of training do you dislike the most?  What part of training do you dislike the most?  I don't have parts like that  She doesn't have what?  I don't like special exercises for the vestibule system when you have to circle around your axis a lot 
[02:03:30]  Is that when you're going in a circle or is that when you're doing  Do you know what that is, Frank?  I don't know what that  I don't know, that's some heavy stuff  Frank looked up from his Twitter like, what?  I was like, what?  Say it again, I didn't understand  That's some Eastern black stuff  When you have to circle around your axis a lot  Like dead wives? 
[02:04:00]  Like pivot  Oh, pivot around  Oh, pivot around  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah  That's his least favorite  What was your least favorite part of training?  Uh, getting up  Oh, okay  Going to the gym  Training  And that was it  You're a very successful, lazy person  Are you excited now that you don't have to wake up and do like six months of, you know, training to get into a fight anyway?  It's just over  I mean, you still teach, right?  I still teach and I do mostly charity stuff, but  It must be great  I'm incredibly happy that I don't work out four or five hours each day 
[02:04:30]  Four or five hours each day  Wow  How many days? Seven days a week?  Six days a week  Six days a week  I did that for 15 years  Wow  Yeah, so now I'm  I don't want to go in the gym  And you got into this through your brother, Ken  Yeah  And you were adopted  Yep  Because you were a ward of the state  Ward of the state  I was a ward of the state too when I was 13  Look how some people succeed and others well  We're on the couch  It's amazing how genetics just make a huge difference  Well, somebody found a hobby and somebody didn't 
[02:05:00]  If I wasn't adopted into a great family that worked out, you know  I didn't know he would have adopted him  I didn't know he was adopted  Yeah, he was adopted  Ward of the state  What a great story  I didn't know that  I was in a group home  And my adopted father was Bob Shamra  And he adopted both Ken and I  Oh, okay  And he was the guy who got us into sports  He told us to go down and get in athletics  And wrestling  And he was, you know, I was a total criminal  He picked a couple of winners  Right  That's good  He had 2,000 kids 
[02:05:30]  And he adopted two of us  2,000 kids  He adopted you when you were 21, right?  I was 21  I was 21  He adopted Ken when he was 18  And what kind of crime did you do?  I mean, I did some crime  I robbed a pizza store on a gumball machine  Okay, yeah  I did that  Of course  Surprise, surprise  I did that  I'm sorry  What did you do?  It's okay  What did you do, tough guy?  I robbed a bookstore, dummy  The first thing I ever did  That's pretty bad  The first thing I ever did  And tell your children not to do this  Because it's a felony  Throwing rocks at a train 
[02:06:00]  Really?  I did that  Throwing rocks at a train  It's a felony  I never knew that  Until I got arrested for throwing rocks at a train  Which they put me in juvenile hall  Which I realized  My home life  Bobby pulled some trains  How did you get caught?  I was forced  I was throwing rocks at a train  But that's an easy one to do  Without getting caught  I'm thinking  The train's moving  That's what I was thinking  I got arrested for the first time  For knocking over a baseball  You know the baseball diamond  How they have the fence on the outfield  We took down the whole fence  For Tufts University's baseball team 
[02:06:30]  Twice  What's wrong with you?  And we got caught  The second time  That sounds real tough  I don't know  My friend, we were in the park  And we saw the cops coming  And my friend Frankie  We were stoned  Obviously  My friend Frankie  Dude, don't run  Just deny it  And I was like, okay  And we tried it  And that didn't work  He threw us both in the car  It's funny how  There was a difference in toughness  It's like  Frank was throwing rocks  At a moving vehicle  And Bob was like  Well, we stole apples one time  And we put them back, of course  I got nothing to say 
[02:07:00]  So you got it  But you didn't get into  You didn't get into  Martial arts  Or pancreas  Was the first one, right?  You didn't get into that  Until later, right?  Not until I was 22  When you were 22 years old  I started training  Yeah, you actually went with Ken  Supported him  And was with the Lions Den  Yeah  I was there in the very beginning  Early days of UFC  And yeah, I mean  The first day of training  I didn't know you could tap  Really?  Yeah  So when Ken was turning my leg around backwards 
[02:07:30]  And I was screaming my head off  Somebody goes  Did anyone tell him he could tap?  And I go  Tap  At the top of my voice  Because I didn't know  That that's how you got out of stuff  That was my first day  What was the worst  What was the worst  Fight  Beating you ever got?  My brother  Your brother just  Yeah  My brother used to just  Beat the crap out of me  Really?  Yeah, because I was  Real smart mouth  And I was  You know  I've always had a lot of confidence  And I've been very articulate  So  Alright  I've always been able to say  Very strong things 
[02:08:00]  And  Ken was able to do  Very big things  To me physically  And he would just  Beat the crap out of me  And you guys were supposed to fight  Well I tried to get him  To fight me for years  Really?  Yeah  And he wouldn't do it?  Well he just  He's had some  You know he doesn't think  Like I think  Like we should make lots of money  Beat the hell out of each other  And have a good life  He thinks differently  And I don't know what he's thinking  Are you guys  I mean you guys  You guys are friends right?  No, no  We're not close  Really?  Yeah, we don't have  We don't have a relationship at all  Are you kidding me?  Wow  I haven't had a conversation  With Ken that didn't involve  Fighting drugs or women  Ever in my life 
[02:08:30]  Wait  You're kidding me  Yeah, I swear to God  You guys never got along?  No, I don't know  I know nothing about the guy  You never had a heart to heart  About you know  The rubber broke  And what do I do?  Never  Ever  Wow  I didn't know that  I never got a birthday card  I never got a Christmas card  I've never got a phone call  Well it's not like  You guys are real brothers  I mean you guys met  In the foster homes  So you guys were  Yeah  Yeah  Because I was in foster homes too  And I didn't like have  I mean 99% of the people  That I was in a foster  They sucked  You know what I mean?  But we got  I mean you know  We spent years  Training together  But he didn't want me there  Ken  Really?  Yeah 
[02:09:00]  Well who put  Your father?  My father  You know  Basically made him  And then  Ken tried to get me to quit  By sort of beating me  And that didn't work  I just got really good instead  Wow  So it just sort of  Backfired  And then  Did that bother him?  Because he was  Original UFC  Original MMA  Star  And then  You  Actually took over  Yeah  And you became champ  And you were just  Kicking the shit out of everybody  Did that bother him?  That you were the  You became the star  And you know  You had your own fans 
[02:09:30]  And you know  You were just known as a badass  I don't know if it bothered him  Because I never asked him about it  But you know  One of the things  One of the reasons  Why I left that camp  Was you know  They told me  You're not a tough guy  You're too nice  Really?  And you're not a killer  And you're never going to be  A world champion  And I was like  Well  I got these other plans  And I had to leave  Wow  Because of how I carry myself  They thought I was  Too soft  Hey but let me ask  Frank something  And I also want to ask  Fedor  Both of you guys 
[02:10:00]  Do you give yourself  After training  Do you give yourself  Any time to just eat bad  Like after a fight  How long do you give yourself  Just to eat like crap?  Well I do  Like a  Cheat day a week  So like  Friday nights  Or date night  The wife and I  We just kind of  Blow it out  But my thing is  I just eat good  90% of the time  That's like the secret  9 out of 10 meals  That go in my mouth  Are good food  See Iraq  You got that backwards  You're working  The wrong system bro  You got to give your  You got to allow yourself 
[02:10:30]  Some shitty food  Every once in a while  Otherwise it stresses  Your mind  More importantly  I want to go to Fedor  Oh  Answer the question  I'm sorry  If he does the same thing  I can't picture him  Eating badly  Does he give himself  Any time to eat badly  Or no?  He eats lots of beets  Well sometimes  I do allow myself  To eat something 
[02:11:00]  If I really want it  Very much  But not during the  Preparation to my fights  But what is it?  What does he allow himself  To eat?  I bet you it's still  Something healthy  Well I can have  Some ice cream  Or cake  Nice  Hey can you ask  Fedor  It's really making me nervous  Why his hand is really bloody  He's got scabs  And all sorts of stuff  On his right hand  Was that from training  Or did he get mad  At someone  On the way  To serious exome 
[02:11:30]  He's got scabs  So this is what I got  During my  During my working out  During my preparation  And as it is situated  On this very place  You know  It takes longer time  for it. It's right on the front  of the knuckle.  Would he be willing to go down the hall? 
[02:12:00]  There are people that kind of  are in charge of our channel who we would love  to see him hit. Would he be willing to do that?  To see him hit?  Yes, people who work for this company, who kind of annoy us,  we would really be very happy if he would just  go down the hall and strike them.  Look, look.  It would make us very happy.  Well, I do not beat people out of the ring. 
[02:12:30]  No, we're not talking about a beating.  We're talking about a charley horse that's going to be there  for a couple of weeks.  Yeah, maybe just a punch to the leg with the chest.  Not the face.  The chest.  God, I wish I had a friend like you are.  How great would life be?  You're talking about the wrong guy.  Frank was in juvie hall.  He'll do it in a second.  I'm out, man.  I'm out.  Bobby, Frank was itching over there. 
[02:13:00]  Ask me, please.  I'll go give somebody a hippie punch.  I'll go old school for you guys.  Is Bigfoot  the least attractive man you've ever fought?  Why so?  Doesn't he not?  What's the weight difference between these guys? 
[02:13:30]  I have no idea.  Oh, he doesn't even care.  He just fights.  That's why you're going to love him.  I don't care.  And of course, we're talking about the big fight.  It's Saturday, 10 p.m. on Showtime.  Strike Force, Fedor, and Bigfoot.  That's why these guys are here.  Just to reset a little bit.  And Frank Shamrock is going to be announcing.  Right, Frank?  I'm calling the action.  Calling the action.  I'm catching teeth from Fedor's punches.  Hey, Frank, can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Now, this is a weird thing  because you guys are kind of going old school.  You're doing a tournament-style heavyweight. 
[02:14:00]  And I mean, you really didn't need to do that either.  I mean, you guys, you know, the heavyweight division in Strike Force is pretty crazy.  It's pretty stacked.  But what made them want to do a tournament to find out who the...  And isn't that going to kind of hurt?  Like, all right, you find out, okay, Fedor wins the whole thing.  Who does he fight?  Everybody just fought over the last six months.  Who does he fight then?  Doesn't that kind of clean it out for him?  I don't think so.  Really?  I think, you know, the problem with mixed martial arts, in my opinion, right now, is it's getting stale. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  I mean, there's no more new techniques.  We've been beating each other up for 15 years now.  Right.  So, you know, one of the things we're always trying to do with Strike Force,  that's why we have the female division.  That's why, I mean, we're always trying to...  I can't even watch that, by the way.  Dude, I love that part.  But it's too...  I can't watch a girl be in a triangle.  Those short shorts.  I love that.  She's in the mount position.  The other one's trying to do the butterfly guard.  And it's just...  I'm sitting there with a heart on him next to my wife, trying not to... 
[02:15:00]  Trying not to...  I can't...  A boob is going to pop out someday.  They're not going to pop out.  We're hoping a boob's not going to pop out.  Why?  What's wrong with you guys?  Let a boob pop out.  But the reason why we're doing the heavyweight tournament is, you know,  mixed martial arts started with a question.  Who and what is the best?  Right.  That was the question.  That's how we got this thing going.  And now we've answered most of those questions.  But now the big question is, who's the greatest heavyweight in the world?  And we think that's important that we find that out.  And this is what the tournament's about. 
[02:15:30]  And I think it's going to bring fresh eyes and energy to the sport and fresh ideas.  That's where Strikeforce is going with it.  I mean, I love the tournament.  I mean, that's my favorite.  Back in the day, the tournament style.  Who is number one?  And not having to wait, like, you know, three years to see all these guys fight each other  and to see a guy defend his belt over and over again.  You're going to have all these guys fight.  And Alistair is a monster.  I mean, he, I can't believe he's great.  You've got a great heavyweight division.  Everybody in tournament is mentally good. 
[02:16:00]  But what about the UFC?  I mean, okay, you're going to be the best in Strikeforce.  This is the number one heavyweight.  Do you think this is going to determine the number one heavyweight overall?  But what are the, you know, Brock and Kane and Junior and, you know, all those guys.  They have an entirely different model for running their league and their talent.  And we believe that your talent should fight everywhere and fight everybody.  And if you're the best in the world, stand up and prove it.  So eventually they'll have to stand up and prove it because we'll have all the best heavyweights 
[02:16:30]  and we'll have all the best middleweights and we'll have all the best lightweights.  We're about creating the best talent and fighters in the world and putting those guys against each other.  That's like our business model.  And then presenting the best mixed martial arts we can.  So that means we've got to do deals with everybody.  That means we've got to be palatable enough to, I mean, we've got seven, eight countries in this tournament.  Like, how hard was that to fly around to eight different countries and do this deal?  That's insane.  Right.  You know, we're the type of company that puts martial arts in front of our brand.  Because it's more important for us that these guys are finding out who the best is and answering the question. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, g'deet, g'deet, g'deet, g'deet, g'deet, g'deet, g'deet, g'deet, g'deet, g'deet.  Oh, Jesus.  Did he?  Is that a question?  Where did he get?  Hey, Fred.  Ian hasn't talked in 20 minutes.  Where did he come from?  I don't know.  It's just rins.  Somebody told him that his answer.  Peter is asking, are you desperate?  Because the question was, where is the toilet?  Yes.  Exactly.  That's all you have after 20 minutes?  I know.  Fucking hell. 
[02:17:30]  That's good.  Hey, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  I wanted to know, too.  What I tend to do.  Maybe we might have to have Travis or somebody bring it up on the computer.  I wanted to know.  I wanted to ask Frank and Fedor both.  To the translator?  Listen very closely, by the way.  We'll mess this one up.  Yeah, because it has to be very nice.  Yes.  We have fighters come in.  We've had BJ Penn has done it.  Ken Velasquez and Randy Couture.  I have them put me in a move, a hold, nicely. 
[02:18:00]  Just to see what it feels like to be in these holds.  So I wanted to ask Fedor what hold he would put me in.  But I will tap very quickly, and it's not for full force.  To show the technique and how it's done.  To show the technique.  But I'm not a martial artist.  I know I look like one, but I'm not a martial artist.  I love it if she messed up. 
[02:18:30]  He accidentally ripped his head off.  Do you want him to?  Yes.  Oh, I want him to.  Yeah, I would love him to.  So I just don't, I don't know which one.  I'm actually trying to find the video.  Whichever one he would like to, because what he thinks would be a good one to put me in.  But not, how do you say very gentle, how do you say gentle in Russian?  Мягко. 
[02:19:00]  Мяха?  Okay, мяха.  See, we had, uh, here's, uh, there's, uh, it's not a good video, but let me see if I can just show you BJ.  Oh, that's funny.  Putting me in the, uh, he put me in a, uh, all right.  Armbar.  Yeah, an armbar, in the chair.  And he's watching now.  Fader's watching. 
[02:19:30]  Okay.  And, uh.  That's good.  That's good.  We did it in the chair.  That's strong.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's good.  That's good, huh?  That was after he lost, too, so you know he gave him a little extra.  He wasn't happy that day.  BJ was not a happy man.  Yeah, some kind of a choker.  Okay, if you need something very gentle, I also can show you the armbar.  Very gentle.  Ah, very gentle.  How do you do the armbar?  The one that BJ did?  Yeah, that's what he did.  Oh, the one that BJ did?  Okay. 
[02:20:00]  Oh!  Wow!  No!  Chop, chop!  Chop, chop!  Chop, chop!  What is chop, chop?  Chop!  What does the hell mean?  He said chop, chop!  What the fuck is chop, chop?  What the fuck is chop, chop?  But he didn't even, he didn't even...  That didn't look like it was any pressure.  That didn't look like anything.  He didn't put any, like, on my neck or anything. 
[02:20:30]  Jim got so nervous, he tried to speak Russian, but only...  I meant to say tap, tap, but I realized I wasn't tapping.  Chop, chop!  I hate to tell you, I didn't get it on film.  He did it way too fast, I'm serious.  Oh, my God.  Chop, chop.  Did Fedor do that again?  How about, uh...  I didn't get it on film.  Well, Sam has a camera.  I think Sam got it.  Showtime got it.  No, Showtime didn't get it.  I don't think he got it.  No, no, no.  What's his favorite hole to put on somebody?  He's a strong guy. 
[02:21:00]  Woof.  So, well, I like different halls.  I, you know, I like submissions, you know, arm bars, you know, leg bars.  Well, I try to work, uh, in all sides, sides, in different sides, in different directions.  There are some halls, uh, which you cannot use very often. 
[02:21:30]  You just don't have the situation, which is good for this, uh, for this very hall.  And if you manage to do that successfully, you'll feel really very happy.  Um, which, I would like him to put me in one.  But I will tap very quickly.  Was this one not enough? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It was.  But Fedor's my favorite fighter, so I don't get a chance.  The other guys always had to put me in one, but there's nobody who would be scarier for me to fight than Fedor,  or so, I would want him to put me in another one.  If you could just touch me one more time, please.  You asked for it, Jimmy.  Do it, Fedor. 
[02:22:30]  Teach him a lesson.  I'm a very bad boyfriend.  This is penance and punishment for my girlfriend, because I'm a lousy person.  Oh, yeah.  What do you think?  I have no clue.  A good choke, maybe?  A good choke?  A good choke.  Jesus.  What is this, Craigslist?  The look on your face when you're saying that is very disturbing.  It's very disturbing.  Okay.  What's Russian gentle? 
[02:23:00]  Mechka.  Mechka.  Oh, he's a scary guy.  What's Russian for keep going?  Ow.  Is that his neck popping?  He got it.  Did his neck pop?  Did you hear that?  Oh, God.  Oh, good boy.  Don't kill him.  Don't kill him.  Oh, my God.  The other guys was great.  The other guys would, like, talk me and go, here we go.  He just grabbed me.  Wow. 
[02:23:30]  Very strong guy.  Oh, we can sit back down.  That was lovely.  Wait.  You got to have Frank do one.  Frank's going to do one.  Can my neck heal?  No, can he do it?  Let him do somebody's arm.  Yeah, Frank, what can you do?  Can you do, like, a Kimura or something?  Can I break his arm real quick?  No, I don't want my arm broken, but could you?  You could just bend it a little bit.  I can fold it backwards real fast.  But you won't do it too hard?  No, no, no.  Okay.  I'm gentle.  That's my wife.  I'm gentle.  I'm not a pretend tough guy.  I'm a sissy.  I can't take the pain.  Oh, no.  Fuck, dude.  That's hilarious.  Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. 
[02:24:00]  Go ahead.  This is what I do when I meet people now, because I'm retired.  How are you doing?  And if they crush my hand and they shake my hand hard?  Right.  And I do this.  Then I just pop.  But what if they don't?  I'll be very gentle when I shake your hand.  If they don't?  Yeah.  What's a good hold that you would put somebody in if you were, like, fighting in a bar or something like that?  In a bar?  Yeah, like, just something that you would...  A hold in a bar?  Well, not that you'd want to hold somebody in a bar, but, like, a good...  Maybe a good leg hold.  Something that could really...  A bar?  Well, not a bar, but some confrontation. 
[02:24:30]  Can you do it?  He just wants it to hurt him, Frank.  He wants you to do something.  Okay, I would need you to do it.  Can you do it?  Okay.  Can you do a knee bar to him, Frank?  A what?  A knee bar.  What's a knee bar?  Crank his...  How about this?  What?  Yeah, do that.  Oh!  That hurts a lot.  What is that called?  Bar move?  Bar move.  That is...  Wait a minute.  Can I...  Wow.  Can I try it once?  That was great. 
[02:25:00]  Can I try it?  Some people, they swing at you and you duck.  They spin all the way around and you grab them.  Can I...  You put them to sleep and then you walk away.  Can I try it, Frank?  Not to be weird.  Do you want to choke him?  Yeah.  Can you choke Bob Kelly?  I'm going to swing at him.  Yeah, you swing at him.  I'm going to swing.  Got him.  Don't swing at him.  Why are you going to do that?  Your cocksock, it can't do it better than you're fucking...  Oh!  Hit!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  That worked.  That worked.  But you got to get drunk and be in a bar.  All right.  That was good. 
[02:25:30]  Why do people like being beat up?  It's because you don't...  You don't get a chance...  Oh, that's fucked up.  There's no sadism.  You don't get a chance to do that without really getting your ass...  That's great.  No fans get a chance to beat up.  I don't know if it hurts.  It's great.  Both sides of your neck.  But it really was.  Yeah.  It's amazing how, like, you know, Cain and all those guys prepared very slowly, and he just grabbed me and put my head...  Wow.  That's got to be horrifying in the ring. 
[02:26:00]  When you watch MMA, you don't...  It's hard to put a perspective on how that feels.  And it's like, now that I've had the armbar and the chokes, it just makes you, in awe of these fighters even more, that this is what these guys are actually handling in the ring.  Yeah, that's...  But that makes you...  It also makes you that they're trying to...  The defense of it all, too.  You see...  You forget about the defense, that you're actually preventing a guy who is an expert at doing that.  You're preventing him from doing that. 
[02:26:30]  And you're trying to do it back.  You know, that's what sometimes you...  I get mad at you when you watch...  And people are booing because it's on the ground, and they just don't understand that these guys...  This guy on the ground is preventing this guy from choking him out every second.  You know, trying to get out of that and back to his feet.  I would say that's the hardest part, though, is understanding how physically challenging and damaging and how much opportunity there is to be hurt, get hurt, or hurt somebody.  And when you get hurt in the ring...  I mean, you got your arm broken by Kong Lee, and you just kept fighting.  Keep rolling.  How do you do that? 
[02:27:00]  I have no idea.  I just stubbed my toe in a fight, and I was like, I give, I give.  Now, you know what?  When you're in there fighting, there's an energy and there's a focus that is nearly unbreakable unless someone turns you, bring it off.  You guys are just wired differently.  We train for it.  That's what it comes down to.  Because Bobby makes a good point.  You stub your toe and you want to, you know, cry to your mommy.  Yeah.  You guys are just wired differently.  I don't understand it on any level.  Yeah, they're different people.  Nah, I don't understand getting fucking hit in the face that hard.  And those, yeah, and those ridiculous holds. 
[02:27:30]  Fuck that.  Did you ever consider, because you're a...  I don't know how that translates, but I'm sure he understands.  Me and Ann have added nothing.  But no, it's...  Me and Bobby getting beaten up.  I'm brushing about a toilet and I just threw nonsense out there.  Do you ever consider, because you're a lighter guy for a heavyweight, and a lot of these heavyweights are so big.  Do you ever consider fighting light heavyweight just to make life a lot easier? 
[02:28:00]  Do you look like your weight a little bit less than all of these heavyweights?  Have you considered a chance to fight in the average weight, which is a heavyweight, or which is a heavyweight?  Yeah, no, I think my weight is a heavyweight.  I think there's no reason to hold a lot of weight for a heavyweight, but to hold a 12-11 weight.  Do you hold a little bit less weight?  Well, to lower it.  Does he start a little... 
[02:28:30]  Oh, you get the answer.  I always forget.  I've got to get the answer.  I almost feel like I understand what he's saying.  Yeah.  I think I'm a heavyweight sportsman, mixed martial artist, because the weight which I have, it is good for the heavyweight division.  And I don't see any sense, actually, to move to the lighter division, because for that I have to lose about 12 kilos.  And I don't see the point.  How many pounds is that?  Like 12 kilos?  24.  24 pounds?  2.2 pounds and 1 kilo. 
[02:29:00]  Okay, so about 24 pounds.  To plug something, too, that these guys are doing today, because...  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  This is the World Heavyweight Grand Prix events.  Today, Tuesday afternoon, 3.30, it's the Strikeforce Free Fan Experience.  It's an open workout at the Roseland Ballroom here in New York City.  It's 52nd Broadway.  It's 52nd Broadway.  Fedor, of course, will be there.  Alistair Wolverine, Josh Barnett, Arlovsky will be there.  Wow.  Verdum and Bigfoot Silva and Sergi. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know how to say his last name.  Haritonov.  Haritonov.  Okay.  And Brett Rogers.  That's finally a name we can pronounce.  Brett Rogers.  Brett Rogers.  Yeah, black guy from Chicago.  That was a great knockout.  Yeah.  Is Fedor starting to learn English or no?  You starting to learn English there, Fedor?  Or no?  No?  No.  Un poquito?  Sit down.  Un poquito?  Sit down.  That's a little bit.  No?  Does he, does Fedor live, do you have a place here?  That's why I'm asking it, yeah.  And in, I know you live in Russia, but does he live, have a home here too in the States? 
[02:30:00]  No, I don't have any home in United States because I love Russia, and every time when I come here, I'm in a hurry to be back home.  So what does he do?  Like, he can't watch TV.  But he doesn't need.  What did he say? 
[02:30:30]  Happy birthday.  Ah, score!  I'm trying, I'm throwing him out there.  I like it, I like it.  See what sticks.  Anthony just bought an iPad app.  What does he do when he's not beating up people in America to pass the time?  He can't watch TV, he can't go to the movies, he can't even talk to, you know, many people.  Yeah.  How does he pass his time before he gets back to Russia?  Does he watch the Jersey Shore? 
[02:31:00]  So, usually my free time I spend with my friends and with my family, so I play with my daughter.  Okay.  Oh, eto harasho.  What?  What did he say?  What did he say?  Oh, that's good.  Oh.  What are you...  The look on his face is priceless, though.  I just, I can't wait for him to mispronounce something.  Yeah.  And then Fader jumps over the console and chokes him out.  I can't wait until he gets a flying head fell into the face. 
[02:31:30]  He's going to think he's saying something nice, but he's really going to be offering him money to break his jaw.  That's right.  No.  All due respect.  I was reading, do you draw in your spare time?  You're an artist?  Like, what do you draw?  I've been dying to know that.  Butterflies.  Yeah, it's probably something nice.  It's probably something nice.  I used to draw, but I'm not doing that now.  I wasn't, I haven't been doing that for a long time. 
[02:32:00]  Now I'm reading.  What is that?  Congratulations.  Who, who...  What are you, an idiot savant?  Are you Travolta in Phenomenon?  I'm just throwing him out there.  I'm just trying, it seems like congratulations are in order.  Can you buy any of his art?  Can you buy any of his art?  Well, I'm afraid you cannot afford that. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, man.  True.  I didn't say me.  I was talking, I'm representing a millionaire.  Well, actually, the drawings, which I make, they're usually for my daughter and for my family. 
[02:33:00]  This is how I express some of my feelings and my emotions.  This is not for sale.  This is, you know, for...  He just likes to do it.  For the sale.  He doodles.  He's not an artist.  Hey.  Yeah, he just likes to do that.  Frank, do you draw?  No.  What do you do besides martial arts?  Business.  A businessman.  That's it?  And I hang out with my family.  I have a little girl that's three years old as well.  So, you're in martial arts.  You do the business.  Yeah.  And I like to hike and read and do business. 
[02:33:30]  That's it?  Do you have an iPad?  No.  You don't have an iPad?  I have an Android.  An Android?  Yes.  Oh, the Android tablet?  I got the Evo and I got a Blackberry and I have a Mac Pro and I have every other electronic  you could ever have.  So, you're a little nerd too?  You like some gadget stuff?  I love that stuff.  Oh, cool.  How hard is it for you to go out with Fedor and out with these other guys because you're  announcing now?  Is it hard to...  I mean, I know you don't miss the training, but is it hard to be around this game without  actually being the one fighting? 
[02:34:00]  No.  You don't mind it?  It's not hard for me.  No, because I'm still very much deep in it.  It's hard to hang out with these guys because I've got to talk about them and I say what is  happening and I try to be honest.  Sometimes they don't appreciate that.  But you'll say something during the fight.  Sometimes they're like, look, I didn't agree with that.  I'm like, that's what I saw.  The hard part is now I'm speaking on their behalf and sometimes it's not what they want  to hear.  Gotcha.  Okay.  I guess we should...  Let's give the big plugs before we wrap up. 
[02:34:30]  Again, the expo today, it's a Strikeforce free fan experience, which is amazing.  All these great fighters, of course, Fedor will be there in fair doom.  I just plugged that.  Friday, there's a public weigh-in at the IZOD Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey, if  you want to see these guys get weighed in.  Saturday, Strikeforce Grand Prix quarterfinals, it's on Showtime, 10 o'clock.  Fedor versus Silva, of course, is the headline event.  And Arlovsky versus...  How do you say the name?  Haritonov.  Haritonov.  Okay, Arlovsky versus Haritonov. 
[02:35:00]  And, of course, I...  I didn't say it, right?  Your confidence bailed out halfway through.  Arlovsky is fighting the other guy.  Wait, wait, wait, Jimmy.  Why were we talking about Bigfoot, then?  I thought that was...  That's his name, Bigfoot Silva.  Oh, okay.  See, I don't know.  Sorry, Frank.  I thought he went around as just Bigfoot.  Yeah.  You had a real name.  You thought he was actually fighting Bigfoot, didn't you?  Yeah.  I got so confused there.  No surprise.  So the fight, Saturday night, 10 o'clock. 
[02:35:30]  And, you know, I'm very happy that you're here in the States.  I have to do something in California.  I'm so angry that I can't attend this fight.  It's, like, literally right across the...  If you're in New York, it's right across the river.  10 o'clock showtime.  Great.  Great event.  Paka da svidanya.  Jesus.  Good luck.  Oh, yeah, very good.  You just did a little English right there.  What did you say?  I saw that.  Yeah.  I said whatever I said.  I said goodbye.  Goodbye.  I said goodbye.  I said goodbye. 
[02:36:00]  And spasiba.  Thank you.  What spasiba?  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  They're very good.  All right, good.  Before things go horribly wrong here.  We're going to stop now.  Thank you very much.  And thank you, Frank, too.  Yeah, thanks, guys.  It was a pleasure, man.  All right, we'll do this.  Thank you. 
[02:36:30]  Hey, man, that was a lot of fun.  Fedor and Frank Shamrock.  We're going to have Frank come back.  Yeah, definitely, because Frank will be in the area.  He's moving to New York.  Frank was better?  Dude, my throat's still hard to swallow.  He's moving to New York to make MMA legal in New York City.  Good for him.  That's what Dana White's trying to do.  Yeah, I know.  It's in all their interest.  Everybody's trying to do that.  Well, Dana's going to do it.  Yeah, I think so. 
[02:37:00]  I'm a Dana guy.  Dana White will get it done.  Yeah?  Yes.  Is that what's going to happen?  I'm a Fedor guy, too, by the way.  Well, yeah.  And I'm also a Frank Shamrock guy.  And I'm also friends with all those other guys that were with Fedor.  Love them.  He has a massive entourage.  He just loves guys.  He does.  Well, I'm not saying that there, Bobby.  That's more you.  You're like the cock, Opie.  Admit it.  Opie, how brave were you during that whole interview?  I don't front.  I'm fucking terrified.  I was going to say, because no one in their right mind was going to bring up Frank's braces. 
[02:37:30]  No.  Oh, fuck no.  Me and Norton were talking.  We were just, hey, brace face.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I was like, hey, what's with that?  Fucking silver mouth.  No, you don't do that.  No.  He doesn't have braces like everyone else got braces, because a couple teeth went in crooked.  They're rewiring his entire fucking jaw.  A full upper and lower set of braces like he's 14.  Because he's finally done with fighting.  He said, you know what?  Yeah.  Let's try to make me straighten his shit out.  Have him got knocked out over the years.  He's not going to get you slammed down his throat again. 
[02:38:00]  He's got 1978 braces.  Oh, there's Frank.  Do you want to ask him?  Hey, Frank.  Anthony.  No.  No, I swear.  No, that's not.  That is right.  No, he just walked by.  Yeah, but here's the thing.  Frank would actually laugh at it.  Did Showtime leave or did Fedor leave?  They're here.  No, Fedor and those guys.  Frank is here.  Fedor might have left because Showtime is shooting for Frank.  Showtime said they got a lot of great footage, so they're like, we'll definitely use some  of that.  Did they film some of the chokes?  They had to have filmed some of the chokes. 
[02:38:30]  You're going to be the big star.  Frank's actually pretty funny, man.  He's great, man.  I would love that.  Yeah, he's great.  Bobby's playing a theater in Albany, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  Saturday night.  Yeah, I think it's Palace Theater in Albany, Saturday night.  Oh, my God.  Great job, bro.  I love how Jimmy said my throat still hurts and no one even fucking...  I know.  Yeah, it's hard to swallow.  And no one even said anything.  What do you mean?  It just hurts to swallow.  I'm fine. 
[02:39:00]  I know what it is.  It's just because I had pressure put on it.  I'm okay.  My neck hurts, too.  The sides of my neck, this right here.  That's great, dude.  I love it.  What is that all about, guys?  It's not...  I go to Jimmy.  You're nuts.  He goes, I love it.  I do love it.  I wanted him to punch me in the arm.  Yeah, the chop chop.  People are saying the chop chop was just fucking hilarious.  Because you don't have, like...  Chop chop.  Fedor.  It's like the odd thing...  He tried to learn Russian.  He went chop chop.  And it went to Chinese.  Yeah, just chop chop.  Dude, Fedor is, like, the quietest of all those guys. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  But of all the guys, he grabbed me the fastest.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he didn't walk me through it, and he did, like, three each time.  I didn't know what he did to your arm.  It looked like nothing.  Did I tell you the truth?  It looked like he put his arm under your arm, put the other arm on top of your shoulder,  and pretty much lifted you up by your arm.  I didn't see what hurt there, but you were in utter pain.  The arm bar that BJ put me in was, like, a cross with his legs and all that stuff.  Fedor just grabbed my arm somehow and used his arm and locked it on mine and was squeezing. 
[02:40:00]  He was just python squeezing my arm, and I was like, I could feel his arm bone.  I was like, ah!  It was his forearm bone.  And you want to go through a translator.  I'm like, that's not smart.  Yeah.  Because it took him a little...  No, he said chop chop.  Chop chop.  Yeah, chop chop.  He knows Russian.  It took him a little longer to let go, too.  The other guys let go right away.  Yeah, he took an extra second, probably.  How bad did you want to go when she asked the question, and then before he answered,  she said, hurry up!  Yeah.  Come on! 
[02:40:30]  I didn't want to at all.  Believe me, I knew some phrases there that were...  I could have gotten in real trouble.  Like what?  I was looking and stuff.  Like, yeah, hurry up.  Or quiet.  Be quiet.  Shit like in the middle of talking, just go, hey, be quiet.  What?  But you should have done that.  Why not?  No!  And then...  Fuck that!  And then go, oh, I...  Oh, I meant to say happy birthday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I wasn't going to say that.  Frank would have a sense of humor.  He probably would laugh and joke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But Roseanne had no sense of humor. 
[02:41:00]  Roseanne!  Yeah.  She had no sense of humor.  She would just straight to him.  He said, quiet.  Yeah, he would know because it would have been in Russian.  So he would have been like...  He just stopped talking, looked at me, and drilled my face in.  He probably would have laughed because he was actually...  He probably would have, yeah.  He seemed to be actually in a very good mood.  He was very smiley.  He could kind of tell that we're having a good time.  But I didn't want to disrespect him or anything.  No, not with...  Dude, he's the biggest entourage of anybody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You think rappers have entourages and these guys are bad fuckers.  They all jacket to say Russia.  But they dare you to have a sentiment that's not pro-Russia. 
[02:41:30]  They all dress like Ali G.  With the Olympic logo, too, by the way.  Oh, is that what that was?  Yeah, that was an Olympic logo.  Yeah.  What does that mean in Russia?  I don't know.  Those guys kick ass.  You know when the homies wear the Cincinnati Reds hat, they're not a fan of the baseball  team.  They're kicking ass and taking names, those guys.  So I'm wondering if the Olympic symbol has something going on.  People are asking about his entourage.  I'm not talking about those guys.  Let's just say they're fucking scary guys.  Let's just say they're the real deal.  End of story.  They're probably everything you have heard. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  He's a Sambo.  I think it's an Olympic sport.  Isn't Sambo?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, Sambo.  So I think he's an Olympic champion, isn't he?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe somebody knows.  But those guys are probably a lot of wrestlers as trainers.  But there's a couple guys that were over there.  We go to Pancake's house.  Those guys over there were the muscle.  The guys over there were the fucking brains.  Yeah, the guys on the left.  And then we had the Fedor.  It was a scene, man.  Yeah, it was a lot of people.  It was a lot of fucking...  He walked through a group.  There had a close to 20 people, right? 
[02:42:30]  And yeah, the shady people could just look outside and go like, uh-uh.  We should have locked the door and shut all the shades and just freaked them out.  Did the shady people fight with a shady guy?  Because there was some rappers where they came out.  Did they say anything disrespectful to the Russians?  Hell no.  They just look at each other like, oh, okay.  I know you.  You know me.  We all know what's going on here.  The other guy's just walking around.  Yeah.  The whole place.  They walked the perimeter.  And no one's going to tell them no.  They're probably casing the joints.  We're going to come tomorrow.  And it's going to be the 35th and then 37th floor.  The entire floor will be gone. 
[02:43:00]  They'll do thousands in improvements to our studio.  God, that was fucking fun, man.  Yeah, I hope it's not all right.  I was so mad.  I was a wild scene.  Yeah, I hope people enjoyed it.  I mean, I know that's not for everybody, but I always rip my balls at some scratching.  I always regretted not getting put in a fucking hole the first time.  Really?  Yeah, I was doing the stare down for a while.  I made Bernard Hopkins stare.  I asked him to stare me down.  And it's scary to see these guys, but Fedor doesn't really stare you down.  He kind of looks away.  He looks meek almost when he's about to fight. 
[02:43:30]  Such a quiet guy that just like, now I want to see the fight.  I'm so mad.  It's like the only chance I'll ever have to go see him fight live.  Showtime, man.  Yeah, showtime.  The best part about showtime is that you get to record it.  You know, UFC, you've got to pay a lot of money.  Which is worth it.  Which is worth it.  I mean, all the fights are worth it.  I want to see Fedor fucking look like a maniac.  Yeah.  We're going to change gears for a second.  I didn't forget it.  Someone on Twitter, he said, trust me. 
[02:44:00]  And God damn it, I trusted him.  And he sent us a great video.  Fishman5440 on Twitter.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  We got a guy crying.  I see him right here.  We got a guy crying in, it looks like Philadelphia.  Did Travis leave the video for you?  Oh, God, that guy.  Yeah, here it is.  This guy, crazy Philly guy.  I'll retweet it in a little bit.  I want to play it on the show first before I share it with everybody.  Now, I guess a library's closing?  A library's closing in Philly.  What's the title of the video so people can find it?  Faggot.  Crazy Philly man crying because library is closing. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  This is all guy.  It's affecting you emotionally.  I am emotionally.  Talk to me a little bit.  Well, I grew up here, I live here, and I used to play football here.  I just don't, I can't believe anybody's going to close this damn thing down.  And I'm a carpenter.  I just, oh, shit.  What did that upset?  Oh, yeah?  What are you kidding?  What are you kidding? 
[02:45:00]  It's like stupid.  Why would they shut down this library?  You grew up at this library?  Oh, definitely.  I grew up on Decatur Street.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  So he lives here.  He's played football.  He's a carpenter.  He grew up on Decatur Street.  And he's frigging nuts.  Decatur Street.  It says Decatur Street.  Why would they shut it down?  I'm a carpenter.  What did he throw that out there for?  He sounds.  Because he could fix the place.  Oh.  He's got to be 70-something, man. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, he's just some old guy going crazy because they're shutting down a library.  Jimmy brought up an interesting point earlier.  That's the place he goes to to download his porn, his kiddie porn.  Yeah, now he's back because his fucking fat wife's going to be looking over his shoulder.  Oh, I swap a carpenter up and jerk off.  Colonel, what are you doing?  I just like to look at them.  Sound like Jackie Martley.  Yeah.  I can't believe they're closing down the library.  It's some Long Island comedy club. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I can't believe they shut down East Side Comedy.  My throat hurts.  We heard you.  It still hurts.  I have an injury.  You probably fucking broke a little bone in there.  I got my new iPad case late last night around 2.30.  The one with the little thing that falls out the back?  No, the new one.  It's around 2.30 in the morning.  I hope you can hook a shotgun up to it.  What's the difference between this one and... 
[02:46:30]  Well, this one is my wife's, the back of her head while we're in bed.  It's perfect.  It just has a stand.  I was sleeping last night.  It kept falling down because my new case hadn't showed up.  Right in the back of her snoring head.  I watched two episodes of Psych.  You leaned it against our head.  Our sleeping head.  She was right on the back of her head.  The wife snores?  Only, only...  I snore really bad every night.  I actually got that snore pillow from Brookstones and it fucking just gave me acid reflux. 
[02:47:00]  How the fuck does a snore pillow work?  What it does is it...  Put it over your face and push.  Yeah, it has handlebars on it.  Snoring will stop.  It comes with a male nurse.  It comes with a big Indian.  There you go.  It's Will Sampson delivers it.  You can get a snore pillow for your nose.  Fucking chip, man.  I can't stand it.  What happened?  So where's the crying guy? 
[02:47:30]  Is he done?  That guy ruled.  Let's play it again.  That guy fucking ruled.  Yeah, I want to hear why he says he's a carpenter.  Yeah, I want to hear it again.  I think he's Jesus.  Let's hear it again.  Yeah, he's like...  It's too good to only play with us.  This obviously is affecting emotionally.  I am emotionally.  Talk to me a little bit.  Well, I grew up here.  I live here.  And I just play football here.  And I just don't...  I can't believe anybody's going to close this damn thing down.  And I'm a carpenter. 
[02:48:00]  I couldn't...  Oh, shit.  He says, oh, shit.  How much is that upset?  Oh, yeah?  What are you kidding?  It's like stupid.  Why would they shut down this library?  You grew up at this library?  Oh, definitely.  I grew up on the camera street.  Dude.  And that guy on the news is just milking it.  He's trying.  Asking him emotional questions.  You're coming here your whole life.  You've been coming here your whole life.  Like, he's trying to get him to cry as long as he can.  Oh, shit. 
[02:48:30]  What did they, bleep it out of the news?  This definitely is the raw, because, obviously, there's no graphics out.  And obviously, he cursed.  So, I'll try to find if this ever aired somewhere.  It's got to be somewhere.  Because they would have to come back from that and be like, oh, yes, he's very upset about  the library.  Or they're snickering and laughing.  Of course.  Not the greatest cry from Philly, though.  Was that guy from?  Oh, no.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio, with two very bad knees. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened?  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  What happened?  Did it work out?  What happened?  I thank God the dream came true.  Good old Mike Schmidt, of course.  Mike Schmidt has cried more on this show.  Just dicks we are.  People actually having emotions is hilarious to us. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know why.  People being emotionally connected to something about their childhood or their career.  And it's just fucking hilarious to us.  It really is everybody.  Come on, Jim.  Stop rubbing my leg.  Just wants to see it.  Fucking shin rubbing me.  It took me 30 seconds to notice.  Because it felt good for a couple seconds.  Just kind of like, oh, that's a nice thing.  Oh, it's Jimmy.  But it's weird how you don't notice for a second.  And you're like, homo move, homo move.  George from Jersey just writes, yay, I got to hear Mickey Mouse say shit. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, shit, kids.  Pulls it down the library.  That's exactly who he sounds like.  Fucking stupid Mickey Mouse.  That guy was, what the hell happened at that library that he's so upset?  I don't even know.  Fucking library.  Who cares?  He grew up there.  He played football there.  He played football right over there.  How do you play football in the library?  He's a carpenter.  Shit.  Oh, outside the library?  What?  I guess so.  I was molested behind that bush.  Yeah, you know, something special happened there.  He remembers.  There's a good Stephen King book. 
[02:50:30]  It's a short story called The Library Policeman.  And he's such a great fucking describer of things.  And I forget if the guy was having flashbacks, but it was like the guy kept, he remembered  himself as a kid and he would say like, he can remember somebody going, I'm the library  police man.  He, the guy had a lisp and he was describing the scent of the guy's breath.  He was chewing something like a mint.  Yeah.  You've been bad.  I'm the library police man.  And then as the story unfolds, you realize that this guy took him behind the bushes outside 
[02:51:00]  the library and fucked him in the ass when he was a kid.  Holy shit.  Little White Sam, Little White Sam his name was, Little White Walking Sam or something.  It was so good.  But he talks about the red hot pain going into his hiney.  Oh.  Oh, it's great.  The library police man.  Police man.  Yeah, that creep.  And he describes looking in the window and seeing a lady doing something while he's being  sodomized.  Oh, it's so good.  Wow.  That library policeman is a lucky devil.  Oh boy, he fucking rules.  They took my library policeman badge. 
[02:51:30]  They said it wasn't for real.  Oh, Officer Paul.  I'm 57 years old.  I'm 58 in March.  I retire from the force.  Yeah, I had to retire.  You had a badge?  Yeah, I did.  I made one.  It said library policeman on it.  Put the list.  Yeah, and I taped it to my shirt.  The books were late.  You had to come with me.  Do you have a uniform?  Yeah, it's like a big long policeman's jacket. 
[02:52:00]  You can hide things.  Yeah, yeah.  Did the story have like, the kid was remembering or thinking back?  Don't remember me.  And it was all like something else?  Yeah.  But then it all came back like, oh no, that wasn't that.  That was me getting fucked.  It's a movie too.  Oh God, that's awful.  I think he said it was a white hot.  But his descriptions of shit are fucking, the misery, I think the opening scene in Misery  is he's describing some sort of ocean of stench or whatever, and it's her breath in his 
[02:52:30]  face.  I believe that's the opening.  Stephen King just knows how to describe.  I mean, that's not really a good thing.  Made a couple of bucks on books, I hear.  Was Misery a good book?  Fucking great, dude.  I only saw the movie, obviously, like everyone else.  The difference in it, there was a little bit more, the book was more brutal, like she  didn't hobble him, she actually chopped his foot off with a hatchet in the book and  blowtorched it to keep it from bleeding.  And she cut one of his fingers off and put it in a birthday cake.  Was Kathy Bates perfect for that role?  Amazing, yeah.  If you read the book? 
[02:53:00]  Thank you, Kenny.  Give me that and a kiss.  Because anyone could have played that.  Someone's got a tweet.  No, she was great, dude.  Anyone could have played James Caan's part, don't you think?  I thought he was good, but she was perfect.  Yeah, that movie is fucking, holy shit.  Yeah, the isolation that you feel.  Oh, yeah.  But when King walks you through it, like, you know, it was an entire novel.  It's like, to walk through every moment of tension and crawling to the door, and he did  one called Gerald's Game, where, dude, conceptually, it was like about this couple, they would go 
[02:53:30]  out, and they, Gerald liked to tie his wife up and dominate her sexually.  So they had a cabin in the woods, and they fucking are doing their sex thing, and she's  tied up, and Gerald's going to spank her or whatever, and he has a heart attack and dies  at the foot of the bed.  Oh, shit.  And now she's handcuffed to the bed, isolated in a cabin in the woods.  And that's the book.  And this, he's so, because he goes through flashbacks to her childhood, I think she was  like molested by her father or something, like, he goes through all this weird shit. 
[02:54:00]  With her father, the library police man.  Yeah, same guy.  But he's just such a genius, even though he was such a tool on the radio, and a corn  ball, but as a writer, man, he's so fucking good.  I don't know why I'm on a Stephen King thing now, but, oof.  Yeah, that would, handcuffed in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah, yeah, it's so good.  And with Stephen King, you know it probably doesn't end well.  But the way she has to, like, kind of cut herself to get her arm to her, wrist to bleed  to get the fucking hand through the, it's like, it's so involved. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, Jesus.  And wild animals come in the cabin.  Yeah, I'm sure.  The door's open.  Great.  Hmm.  Wonderful.  And fucking, uh, every book he has is written in Massachusetts, Maine, I think.  Yeah, it's always in Maine.  In Maine.  All of his books are set in Maine.  Somewhere in Connecticut.  It's always Maine.  The one in Connecticut that he fucking was weird, uh, uh, April 30th at Foxwoods, it  was, uh, the-  Oh, right, right, right.  No, no, I'm not talking about that.  Oh, my God.  The other thing with me and Brewer and Burr and David Tell coming to Foxwoods, tickets 
[02:55:00]  on sale this Friday morning.  The super show that was in Atlantic City?  Yeah, 10 a.m.  We are literally only doing one show this time.  We kept saying that last time.  This time, the room's only available for one show.  Oh, really?  Saturday, April 30th.  So that thing's going to sell out.  I think so, yeah.  Get on the phone.  Oh, yeah.  Saturday morning.  Friday morning, 10 o'clock.  Oh, nice.  Is it hard to sell a theater?  Because I'm doing one Saturday night.  With those guys, it was a lot easier because you have four people you're pulling from.  Myself, in some places, yes, like, I still have tickets in Jersey.  It's not as easy.  Where are you in Jersey? 
[02:55:30]  It's in Montclair, but I'm saying, like, honestly, I might even plug it.  It's like, selling a theater by yourself is harder now unless you're a Z's or a fucking,  uh, Dane.  Or, like, the guys that sell big, sell.  Louie.  Louie could sell out fucking-  Louie could sell out Louisiana right now.  Louisiana.  Yeah.  It's so funny, though, because, like, five years ago, he wasn't even, he was doing clubs.  Yeah.  And probably not even selling out at clubs.  A few viral videos, fucking funny videos, like that church thing.  That's it.  And he got fucking, Louie's thing was, that, we're flying, you're in a chair in the sky. 
[02:56:00]  He did that, I think, on Conan on TV.  That was a regular TV spot that fucking just put him through the roof.  Yeah.  That video went viral.  The show became such a hit.  Why do I think he did that on Leno?  It was Conan?  Uh, yeah, it was Conan.  I thought Conan.  Definitely Conan?  Okay.  Yeah.  I think it was Conan, yeah.  I think it was on the couch, too, right?  Yes, he was sitting there.  He was on the couch.  He was just hanging out.  Wow.  Yeah.  Doing that on the couch.  Well, he does, he, he can, he does his, he can do his material on the couch, but, like,  conversation, because his act is conversational.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:56:30]  So, yeah.  He's one of, honestly, I don't know what you're talking about, Louis, he's one of the few  fearless comics.  Like, he just, I don't know why he gets away with everything he does, but it's because,  I think, because he's so unapologetic about it, and he's just completely not afraid when  he's saying it.  Yeah.  He just has this really weird knack for doing that.  Something about his demeanor and his, uh, the way he just carries himself.  He's really smart, though.  He actually defends the fucked up shit he's about to say, or after he says it, with logic.  You're like, all right, well, that fucking makes sense, in a way, so, I get it, you know?  Yeah.  When he's talking about fucking crazy shit, he's like, fucking, this is why I'm, he's 
[02:57:00]  really, he's like a fucking savant.  I know, he is really smart.  He should be inventing shit.  Yeah, he should be working for NASA or something.  You realize he's smart, and you get mad, it's like, eh, I just thought you were a funny  guy, dope, or something.  Yeah, he's like a genius doing dick jokes.  Hey, bastard.  Funny, funny, son of a bitch.  Good news, the bag of bread has arrived, so.  Bread's here.  We're gonna put, uh.  What about the bag of shit?  Well, he arrived an hour ago, don't worry, he won't be on the radio, for the people that  hate him.  Don't worry, he won't be on the radio.  But, uh, Bobo, did you see the Egyptian guy with the bread fucking element? 
[02:57:30]  Not in science.  The Egyptian magician!  I got bread on my head!  Ah!  They hit me with rocks!  Why?  They needed, they needed homemade helmets to protect themselves from the rocks during the  uprising in Egypt, and one guy, not that guy, he's trying to fucking, he's a rip-off.  No, but a real guy, the only thing he could find was a bunch of bread, and he made a bread  helmet in the middle of this fucking...  This guy's the newest internet sensation right here.  This guy rules. 
[02:58:00]  He's got bread taped to his head, so the rocks won't hurt him.  So I'm gonna get...  It's fucking genius, though.  Bread armor!  It works, I guarantee that fucking Egyptian heart of 30-day-year-old bread.  I think it does, too.  That they fucking eat.  I think a few rocks bounced off that.  Fuck yeah, that works.  He's got two subs on the side of his head.  And his arms, it's the perfect pose for internet sensation.  So Sam went out and got bread, we got Bobo, and I know where the pigeons are, so I'm fucking  putting a bread helmet on Bobo and taking him where the pigeons hang out. 
[02:58:30]  Ah, that's great.  Are you gonna dig that out?  You'll hollow that out a little bit, you'll put it on his dumb head.  And then what are you gonna do, put the baguettes down the side?  No, we're gonna make him hold them, so the pigeons, he's gonna look like the guy.  You know what, though?  You gotta cut one in half.  Yeah, you need crumbs.  Because he needs the two baguettes down the side like...  You can tie it.  You can actually tie it, because if you have him hold it, he'll drop them like an idiot.  You can just tie it with a big rubber band or something like that, like on the top.  Yeah, just make what that guy has.  Get some saran wrap and wrap it up in the birdies. 
[02:59:00]  You can't eat it, though.  Pigeons will go right through that.  Well, leave some openings.  The whole top could be open.  His dome.  Yeah, just do one around to hold it on his head.  And a chin strap.  And a chin strap, right.  We're gonna work on it.  I know where the pigeons are.  And then, like, pay us.  We're gonna film this shit.  How much?  Hey, Chip.  Good bread.  That was Norton.  Oh, the bread looks...  I know.  I was trying to save you.  Look at that.  Oh, the bread looks soft.  No, you can't have...  I just wanna bite some.  What are you doing, Bob?  I know.  I just wanna pretend I'm a pigeon.  I wanna see if this bread is good. 
[02:59:30]  Bobby, get the plug out.  I gotta go find the pigeons.  Palestina, this Saturday night.  Albany, New York.  One show, one show only.  Me headlining, and then three other people.  Alright, I think we did it, right?  Any other plugs?  Anything else?  Yeah, that's great.  No, I think we're great.  That was a good show, old chap.  That was fun.  That was a good show.  Videos be up soon, right?  Oh, fuck.  I got a lot to do.  You gotta upload.  Yeah, I'll upload.  I'll upload to my channel.  It'll be radio on YouTube.  Sam's got better footage, I think, though.  I wish you would've got the armbar, because Sam's angle was decent. 
[03:00:00]  I was moving.  I moved the mic for the chokes, though.  I got the armbar.  Oh, you said you didn't get it?  No, the first...  He was lying.  I got everything, actually.  Oh, you were just lying.  He wanted to do it again.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't know that?  How dumb am I?  What am I, a fucking listener?  How did I not know that?  He wanted to see you in pain again.  Of course I got everything.  I was wondering why.  Maybe it's cat.  I was trying to tell Jimmy I didn't get it on camera, knowing Jimmy would love to have this  on camera.  I didn't even see that, though, because I thought he really didn't get it.  Well, I would've pulled it off, too, but there was a Showtime camera in here.  Sam had a camera, so fuck. 
[03:00:30]  But I was hoping he would do it again, make him believe I didn't get it.  All right, guys.  It was a pleasure.  See you again.  Yes, indeed.  This is the Open Entry Show.  Open Entry.  Open Entry.  All the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
