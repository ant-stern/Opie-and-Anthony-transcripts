<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a humorous exchange about a phone operator mishap, setting the tone for the broadcast.  Jim Norton, promoting his new book "I Hate Your Guts," joined Opie and Anthony in studio. The book, featuring scathing celebrity commentary and photos (including infamous blurry shots from the Aspen Comedy Festival and the recurring joke of a blurry Randy Johnson picture), sparked reminiscing about past guests like Bernard Goetz.  They also discussed Norton's appearance on HBO's "Down and Dirty,"  mentioning Sean Rouse and anecdotes about his health and dating exploits.  Technical difficulties briefly interrupted the show before shifting to a discussion of the upcoming World Series, with the hosts expressing their disdain for the Tampa Bay Rays' advancement and fielding listener calls sharing similar sentiments.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls about MRSA infections, with callers detailing their experiences and the hosts adding humorous, albeit morbid, commentary.  A nurse and a doctor called in to offer medical clarifications. The conversation then briefly touched upon the box office performance of "W" and other films before returning to listener calls and banter.

The show then heavily focused on the 2008 Presidential election, specifically Colin Powell's endorsement of Barack Obama,  the speculation surrounding rally attendance, and criticism of John McCain and Sarah Palin.  Sarah Palin's Saturday Night Live appearance, including Alec Baldwin's mistaken identity anecdote, was also discussed.  Jim Norton again discussed "I Hate Your Guts," explaining its inspiration from the Imus scandal. Rich Voss, a comedian, joined as a guest, discussing his upcoming dental work, prompting jokes about his toothless act. Mick Foley, another guest, recounted a lengthy, humorous story about Anthony Cumia's then-girlfriend, Jill, involving a party at Foley’s house, stolen belongings, and a clothing-burning incident.  Intern David contributed his "Kosher Sports" segment, characterized by physical contact and sexual innuendo, punctuated by listeners correcting his Jewish holiday knowledge.

Mick Foley remained as a guest, discussing his professional wrestling career, injuries (including numerous concussions), steroid use, and his transition from WWE to TNA.  He detailed the physical toll of his career, contrasting his style with other wrestlers, and shared anecdotes about his children's changing perceptions of his work, including a negative audience experience at a "Traveling Virus" show.  Cheech and Chong then joined the show, discussing their reunion tour, past drug use, views on the 2008 election,  their post-breakup careers, and Chong's prison experience and documentary.  Foley remained throughout, sharing another anecdote. The guests and hosts concluded with promotional announcements.

A later segment revisited professional wrestling with Mick Foley ("McFoley"), focusing on his injuries, including a 16-foot cage fall, and the contrast between on-screen personas and off-screen personalities.  A video clip of Foley's falls was shown. Cheech and Chong joined again, prompting discussion of the hosts' celebrity photos and criticism of a staff member's photography skills (E-Rock). Handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold then analyzed intern David's handwriting, discussing her credentials and providing insights into his personality, potential learning disabilities, obsessions, and even sexuality.  The discussion included crude banter, references to the JonBenét Ramsey case, the "devil's fork" in serial killer handwriting, and analyses of John Edwards' and Barack Obama's handwriting.

A final segment featured a phone interview with Michelle Dresbold, author of *Sex, Lies, and Handwriting*, discussing graphology and interpreting handwriting to reveal personality traits and potential health issues.  Callers submitted their handwriting for analysis, prompting jokes and off-color remarks. The conversation touched upon John McCain's and Kurt Cobain's handwriting, and various celebrities' styles. Comedian Voss received an on-air send-off, and the hosts reviewed listener-submitted "Line of the Day" entries.  The segment concluded with a brief discussion of Jim Norton's "I Hate Your Guts."  Opie, Anthony, David, and a caller named Kenny were present in the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop shots.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you Alan Alda?  Okay.  So let's get to the meat of the issue.  You had AIDS.  How long did you have AIDS for?  I think about six months.  Yeah.  I must have had a light case.  Did you notice that the women really like the Obama guy?  Because he's got a huge c***.  Well done.  That's why.  Hello, sir.  This is operator 8-0 with an IP relay call. 
[00:00:30]  Do you know how to use relay?  No.  No, you c***.  No, I'm sorry.  I mean, no.  Calling for supervisor assistance.  Please hold.  Oh, boy.  Now you've done it.  Oh, I thought that was a computer voice.  You went in and dropped an A-bomb.  That was a real voice?  What do you think?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Just a bunch of A-holes.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  And we're off and running with another week of fine radio.  See, we haven't even done anything yet, but I know by the end of this week, there'll  be a bunch of highlights that people will be talking about. 
[00:01:00]  That's how confident we are in our radio show.  Exactly.  Opie, Anthony, and author Jim Norton.  Author.  Again.  When are we going to write our book?  We have a stupid book deal just sitting there waiting for us.  We really got to stop being lazy, Anthony.  Jimmy's up to his second book.  I'm just coming up with more material for it.  Yeah, well, that'll be for the second book, your own book.  I think we should write a book together, and we should write books separately. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, I think that would be pretty cool.  But how about we should start, like, maybe writing?  Because Jimmy's way ahead of us now.  The bad part about writing a book is the writing.  The writing part.  Like, everything else rules.  Yeah.  But the writing.  It does tend to be the annoying part.  The cover art is the fun part.  That's the real time-consuming part.  Writing.  But it's not about us.  Jim Norton.  Look at this cover.  It says, New York Times best-selling author of Happy Ending. 
[00:02:00]  Jim Norton.  I hate your guts.  When is this available for everybody else, Jimmy?  On November 4th.  It's Amazon pre-sale now.  Nice.  How cool is that?  Yeah, man, I'm sorry.  Jimmy walked in about 15, 20 minutes ago and plopped these books down in front of all of us.  And just a quick, you know, just quickly going through the pages.  This looks really, really cool.  Tons of photos.  Yeah.  A lot of your celebrity photos.  A lot of celebrity photos that didn't come out right.  Yeah.  Stupid Steve Martin. 
[00:02:30]  The Steve Martin blurry one is really good.  The Imus picture.  You wouldn't hit a mongoloid with glasses, would you?  It's his little softball or baseball or Little League, whatever that is.  Oh, yeah.  It's a picture.  Yeah.  A mongoloid with glasses.  Yeah, my first small picture, that was awful.  Now, Jimmy, for the people, I think the title says it all, but I hate your guts.  What's the book about in general?  I just blast.  It's just, what happened with Imus annoyed me so much.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  The blurry picture is great.  The what?  The blurry picture.  Oh, of Steve Martin, yeah.  That was the Aspen Comedy Festival.  Know why it's great?  Because we know what that probably did to you psychologically.  You're probably still obsessed about the fact that you didn't get a good Steve Martin picture.  I did not know how to operate the camera at that point.  That's years ago.  Yeah.  And all my pictures came out blurry because the flash wasn't working.  So I blew pictures with B.B. King.  That was when my Charlton Heston photo got ruined.  So, yeah, it's just blasting people. 
[00:03:30]  Hillary, Heather Mills, Sharpton, Jackson, you know, all the people you want to blast.  For all the New Yorkers, a fine picture of Bernard Goetz, the day we almost all died because we thought he brought a cunt to the studio.  Yes.  After we pissed him off.  I miss having him on, man.  He was a fun guest.  He really was.  With his stupid squirrels.  Oh.  Yeah.  OCD.  Everyone should be a vegetarian because it makes you peaceful.  Spreading his papers out.  His whole little area he was creating.  What a kook.  Hilarious Bernard McGurk right before he leaned over and bit me on the neck. 
[00:04:00]  He does look like Nosferatu, doesn't he?  Bernard is one of Imos' people or the people out there who are not sure.  Yeah, Bernie is brilliant, but he's just a creepy looking dude.  Here's my favorite, though.  What's his name?  Walking away.  Oh, that's right.  The Randy Johnson photo.  The Randy Johnson photo, which is legendary.  We've talked about that on the show where I told Jimmy we were having breakfast and I go,  Jimmy, there he goes, Randy Johnson.  And we ran down the sidewalk to try to get a picture. 
[00:04:30]  And Jimmy was denied.  So we have this big dork walking across the street.  He's like seven foot eight.  You can't miss him in this photo.  It looks like a giraffe walking across the street.  It really was.  We were sitting in the Brooklyn Diner with Tyson Walter.  And we just saw this big dopey lumbering head.  He goes, that's Randy Johnson.  I'm like, where?  And he's the only person making eye contact with me.  Well, yeah, because to explain, we were sitting in a booth right next to the windows and how  these booths are set up.  You can't see people walking by unless you're seven foot eight or whatever the hell he is. 
[00:05:00]  You're on a stilt.  And next thing you know, this head just goes bobbing by the window.  This is really funny, Jim.  Thank you.  Your picture captions are great.  Yeah, absolutely.  There's a lot of pictures in here.  Yeah.  And a lot of words.  Now we've got a problem because we tell everybody that reading is for queers.  So what do we do?  We make an exception?  Yeah, be queer.  We want people to read for the next month or so?  That's hurtful.  Writing is for queers, too. 
[00:05:30]  It didn't stop me.  Don't use that word like that to mean something bad.  It's hurtful.  Oh, my God.  You've got a Benjamin Bornstein as a fat C.  Oh, yeah.  I give Maxwell a good trashing in this, too.  Oh, good.  Good.  And some girl wore a Benjamin Bornstein as a fat C shirt to the show in Cleveland.  So I got a nice photo of her in there.  Hope her family knows she was there.  There you go, fat boy.  You made Jim Norton's book.  Are you proud of yourself?  That's not funny.  Yeah, the book's not funny. 
[00:06:00]  I ran out and picked up the first copy.  Shut up.  Yeah, here's the thing.  Shut up.  He's a joke in the industry.  Everyone knows it.  Very cool, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  Jim Norton, I hate your guts.  The GMB, no.  You actually put that in with his picture with Jason Giambi.  I cannot wait to read this.  Yeah, I give Sterling a beating.  You are an ass.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm going to start reading this immediately. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  I just want to get more copies for the rest of the guys.  I only got a couple of copies.  Screw them.  Believe me, I have to say that.  Yeah.  Steve looked at it.  He didn't know what it was.  It's a book.  What's this?  You was a little eager.  Oh, my God.  You had no business being on a freaking baseball field.  Dude, I was terrible.  Aw.  But you tried every year because I see you getting bigger and bigger with the boys.  Yeah, three years.  And then finally said, all right, enough.  I played a little.  It's funny.  I just got contacted by one of my old teammates. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah?  Like last week, this guy Dave.  Yeah, he emailed me.  His father was one of my coaches.  He was the one that yelled at me for doing the ballet spins in the outfield.  Does he need money?  No, it was just a hello.  That's good.  I always expect him to ask for something.  Every time my phone rings and it's someone I haven't talked to, and I'll give it like,  if I haven't talked to this person in 10 years and they're calling me, I'm like, all right.  What tragedy that happened to you that you need my help?  Yeah, or it's, hey, could you perform at a benefit?  Which I don't mind if I can do it. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, no.  A lot of times it's, you know, which is the same as money.  Whatever.  I do what I could do, but I'm just saying.  It would be nice to hear from some of these people just because, you know, because.  Just because.  Right.  You want to say hello and they want to see how you are.  Right.  Exactly.  Very rarely does that happen.  Yes.  No.  All right.  Once again, they pre-order on Amazon, Jimmy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's cheaper, actually.  $8 cheaper to pre-order on Amazon.  Oh, my God.  $8 cheaper.  It's on ONA.  You can go right there.  It's on ONA.  Here, hold up the book, Jimmy.  I want to get a little picture.  Oh.  A little picture of Jimmy holding up one of the first printings of his new book. 
[00:08:00]  These are the first ones.  There you go.  Is the rear cover an actual picture of you doing that?  No.  It looks good, though, right?  It looks very good.  It looks very realistic.  Why wouldn't they let you do it for real?  I probably could have, but it was on a studio floor.  Yeah.  But it wouldn't have photographed well because we had to do so many takes with the camera  to make sure that the camera, because you had to reset the lighting and stuff.  It might not have picked up because I had to use a big squirt bottle. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, just taking a leak on the flowers on the floor.  That's nice.  Very cool.  Jimmy, you've got all sorts of stuff going on because then down and dirty on Friday.  You said you like Sean Rouse?  Oh, my God.  I miss that guy.  I love him.  And wasn't he the guy that was in when we had the big fight?  No.  Was he in?  Or was it Burr?  I think Sean Rouse was there, too.  And I think we scared him off because we haven't seen him since.  Oh, hold on, Danny.  Sorry.  He wasn't there for the fight, but it was because of him that the fight happened.  Oh, right.  So maybe he's feeling a little guilt. 
[00:09:00]  No, it's funny.  Which is weird because I'm a huge fan of Sean Rouse as well.  Sean called me.  It was Saturday morning.  I guess it aired Friday night.  And it was mixed up because I thought it was Patrice's episode this week, but it was Bill Burr.  So you can get on demand tonight if you want.  I promoted that wrong, but HBO told me the wrong thing.  All the guys were definitely good on this down and dirty.  But Sean Rouse.  Right.  I mean, Bill Burr, what can you say about him?  He's great.  Yeah.  But to see Sean Rouse in that forum is very exciting.  I wish he explained to the audience about his rheumatoid arthritis and all that. 
[00:09:30]  Dude, Sean needs so much.  I hate it only being able to give him extra money.  I think he's a guy that you want to watch for 25 minutes or a half hour.  He's a great comic.  My girl said that she was in Atlantic City.  It was one of these weekends I couldn't make it.  And she was down there with a couple of brothers and a few friends.  And she saw Sean Rouse perform.  I forgot the details.  He was warming up.  Maybe for you.  I'm not really sure.  But whatever.  That was a long time ago?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A few years ago.  And they were hanging out after the show.  And he's not supposed to drink because he has rheumatoid arthritis.  And supposedly with the medication he's taking, it's just the worst thing you could do. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, no.  Explain his hands.  They're like this.  They're just all naughty.  And I have no problem saying this because he talks about this in his act.  You know, he shows his horrendous arthritic elbow.  And he makes everybody uncomfortable and then makes, like, hilarious jokes about it.  His fingers.  Picture yourself.  Hold a softball in your hand and then take the softball out.  The position in your hand is in.  That's how a lot of times Sean's hands are.  And his knuckles are very swollen. 
[00:10:30]  And he has, like, what is it?  Sonomial fluid, is it called?  That builds up or whatever.  Yeah.  So he's a mess.  And he's on this medication.  And then every doctor says you shouldn't and you can't drink on this medication.  But he loves his drink and he doesn't care.  So in the mornings, because he drinks so much, he can barely move.  He's, like, dehydrated and just in extreme pain until the alcohol gets out of his system.  Yeah.  And he talks about that on stage.  But anyway, back to the Atlantic City story.  So after his show, he's hanging out with my girl and a couple of her friends. 
[00:11:00]  They're kind of just hanging out in a restaurant or a bar or whatever.  And Sean is using those creepy hands you just described.  That he's trying to pat, like, one of my girl's girlfriends.  He's hitting on her.  Jesus.  I heard it.  Oh, boy.  I heard it, too.  Isn't that great?  You know.  Hey!  There we go.  Did that actually work?  Yeah.  It had to kind of reset something. 
[00:11:30]  So I hit it or I yell into it.  No, let's do it again.  There you go.  Well, because Stunt Brain was tapping on my module.  They spent the whole weekend here trying to fix everything.  Yeah, the whole weekend was spending here fixing everything.  And the initial problem is still not fixing.  And the, yeah.  What is it, a wire?  It's probably a wire.  It's probably some stupid one wire that's not hooked up.  Yeah.  It's just hitting another wire.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  That's amazing.  Well.  And just took us out of our first break, which is going very well.  That's okay.  No worries, Corcoran. 
[00:12:00]  No big deal, right?  Well, you know, it is the first time I brought it up.  So give him time to, oh, that's right.  Oh, literal Jim.  Literal author Jim.  Yeah.  But getting back to Down and Dirty, HBO Friday nights at midnight, there's one to go.  Sean Rouse was great.  And he really, really should be on the national stage.  He's a psychopath.  My phone rings Saturday morning.  He goes, hey.  I'm like, who is this?  He goes, Sean.  I'm like, how you doing?  He goes, all right, man.  What's up?  I'm like, I'm just kind of sleeping.  He's like, all right. 
[00:12:30]  He doesn't say anything.  He's just a weirdo.  He just calls.  He was really excited that he was on HBO.  Of course he was.  But he didn't want to, I guess, openly say that.  He's a kook.  He's a kook.  But yeah, everyone has said that he did great.  Everyone is talking about Sean Rouse.  Look, there's many reasons why you should, you know, take a peek at Down and Dirty.  But especially the one that's going to be on demand tonight.  Check out Sean Rouse.  He's a creep.  And we love him.  He tours with Attell a lot, too.  Dave loves him.  So a lot of you guys have seen Attell.  You've probably seen Sean.  And I did a New Year's Eve with him.  That's been when Lindsey came. 
[00:13:00]  It was me, him, and Yoshi.  Right.  In our AC.  And they booed poor Yoshi.  They shouldn't have.  Yoshi's funny and booed.  Yeah.  They saw, you know.  All right.  They were creepy.  Why don't we take our first break?  Tweak Anthony's mic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Try to fix it.  Just hit things and it'll work.  Yeah.  A lot of things have happened since the last time we all talked.  Just Danny's hat.  Yeah.  We made fun of it.  Actually, Travis made fun of it instantly.  The second he walked in, he goes, you have something red on your head. 
[00:13:30]  It's cold outside.  I know, but it's cold out, so he's got a Nike, a red, bright red Nike hat on.  That's great if it's cold outside and you need to be spotted from a helicopter in a crowd.  Where's Danny's hat?  There he is.  Bright hat.  It does.  It's like Kennedy on the way to Parkland Memorial.  Wow.  Too bad they couldn't get the Nike logo on his head.  It would have been great for the company.  All that exposure. 
[00:14:00]  877-212-0&A.  Lots to talk about.  Colin Powell, Obama, Sarah Palin on SNL, some baseball, some freaking football, and other things.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony.  Ground ball to second.  He won by those guys.  Rays are going to the World Series.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Stupid Rays blew it for everybody. 
[00:14:30]  What was the final score?  Ah, 3-1.  I'm depressed today.  They just ruined the World Series for everybody in America.  Who wants to see the Rays in the World Series?  I guess so.  It was set up perfectly.  The Red Sox and the Phillies?  That would have been a great one.  Instead, we'd get the dumb Rays.  Those Florida teams are scary, man, because it's almost like they're only a few years in the league.  If I was the Phillies, I'd rather face the Red Sox than those stupid Rays.  Kind of know what you're dealing with and everything. 
[00:15:00]  It's just a crapshoot, as they say.  I guess everybody was on to the fact that Major League Baseball was kind of setting up the World Series year after year with the big market teams and said,  You know what?  We've got to just let this play out naturally for once.  Yeah.  So now we get the Rays.  Ugh.  I still call them the Devil Rays.  The Red Sox made it really interesting, though, man.  Go Phillies, go.  What can I tell you?  I've been pushing for the Phillies for a while now, ever since my Mets were out. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  The Phillies are going to win this thing.  Oh, Jesus.  They're going to win this thing.  Everybody knows it.  I'm so sorry, Philadelphia, for that endorsement from Opie.  Everyone knows.  Oh, God.  That only means take every penny.  No.  Every penny you have, especially if it's in the stupid stock market, and just dump it all.  On the Rays. 
[00:16:00]  The Phillies, it's their year.  They've been sitting around for the last week waiting for an opponent.  And they've got the Rays, which we've all admitted is like a minor league baseball team.  Well, that minor league team, you've just thrusted them into championship-dom.  And Chris is talking for everybody.  Well, I guess I'm talking for everybody, but I think me talking for everybody is better than Chris talking for everybody.  Because he writes, nobody wanted to see the Sox in it again.  Really.  No one wants to see the Red Sox in the Phillies in the World Series? 
[00:16:30]  No one?  Really?  Want to see the Rays?  I don't think so.  I'd rather see the Red Sox.  That's a more classic two-team course.  Of course it is.  The Rays.  Let's say hi.  Hivalry.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Stryker.  Morning, boys.  Morning, Stryker.  Yes, you know, let's see.  First, Ope called on the Phillies to win after they beat the Dodgers.  Then he called on, kept saying, Go Fox last week.  So I'd like to congratulate the double Rays on, or excuse me, the Rays, on becoming the World Series champion. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  It's the foregone conclusion.  Thanks, Ope.  All right.  We don't even have to play it, right?  It's the Phillies' year.  Just give it to them, yeah.  Bill and Charleston.  Hey, Ope, how did the Rays screw up?  They won.  You're blaming it on them.  Didn't Boston have something to do with that?  I guess the Rays blow it by winning.  Didn't they want to?  No, they blew it for everybody.  They should have done the right thing.  Except them.  They should have done the right thing and lost Game 7. 
[00:17:30]  They're on the game?  Yes.  I know exactly what I'm saying.  No one wants to see the Rays in the World Series.  Most people in Tampa don't care about this team.  They started caring about this team about a month ago.  You ever see the stands at a Rays game?  It's half empty.  Empty.  More than half.  So I bet you more people in the Tampa Bay area would rather see the Red Sox than the Phillies.  Because they don't care about their baseball team.  I know what I'm talking about, Bill.  I've got to go with you.  Most of the people that live down there are from Boston and New York. 
[00:18:00]  So that's probably who they're rooting for.  You're right.  Exactly.  A lot of New Yorkers, especially down in the Florida area.  All right.  Josh in Philly, what's going on?  F-U, Ope.  Shut the hell up already.  There you go.  Philadelphia teams alone.  You're looking for the Phillies already.  Now stay the hell away from the Flyers and the Eagles.  Oh, how about them Flyers?  Haven't even won a game yet.  Shut up!  How about those Flyers, huh?  Not that my Islanders are doing any better. 
[00:18:30]  Don't help me.  Hey, I'm marrying a Philly girl.  Everyone knows I've got to start pushing for the Philly teams.  Except for the Flyers.  Never from the Flyers.  And then, did the Cowboys play last night?  They lost by 21, I think.  Is that the third straight loss?  Did they play?  Apparently not.  No.  They showed up.  No.  No, I don't follow.  A bunch of bums with stars on their helmets.  Ran around with the Rams.  Allowed them to score a lot of points.  I don't follow America's team.  They lost.  Yeah, I don't either.  America's team lost last night.  Yeah.  Or yesterday, whatever. 
[00:19:00]  They're still 4-3, Jimmy.  I know, but weren't they 4-0?  Were they?  I want to say they were 4-0.  Really?  The three straight losses?  Yeah, it's not good.  What happened?  No.  Why can't they just do it nicely?  Just play and win.  Yeah.  Some W's, guys.  Come on.  You see the Jets game.  Did they win?  I lost in overtime.  Oops.  57-yard field goal in overtime.  57-yarder.  And the Jets lose. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  They blew it.  I just want one of my teams to be successful.  It's been so long.  It's just bet against Opie.  I'm sorry, but that's just what you have to do.  It's not going to happen every single time, but like most times, the percentages are astounding.  Oh, I'm not perfect with this, but the odds are ridiculous.  Definitely.  I have barely picked a winner in the last, I don't even know, 10 years maybe, something 
[00:20:00]  like that.  And look at my teams.  Jets suck.  I don't just suck.  Knicks aren't going to be that great.  Why don't I just...  Mets did a great job of...  Mets.  That's right.  They didn't...  Yeah, with the big collapse.  Yeah.  Two years in a row.  So, let's say hi to Wes the Trucker.  Wes?  Hey, boys.  Wes, up until two weeks ago, I live in Orlando, about an hour from Tampa, and up until two  weeks ago, I didn't even know that they were even in the playoffs, and I think Ant mentioned  the name change, and I didn't even know that they changed their name until Ant mentioned 
[00:20:30]  it.  Yeah.  We all thought it was the double raise until, I think, last Friday.  I'm not even kidding.  Yeah.  Hi, boys.  We have no clue.  And then Big Blue won again, right?  Yes, they did.  It's all about the Giants in this town.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it now.  What are they?  Four and one?  Five and one?  Yeah.  Five and one.  All right.  There's your sports, I guess.  Yes, buts. 
[00:21:00]  And then some dude lost his foot.  Like, Stuntbrain was telling me a story.  I'm like, why isn't this on the front page of the sports section?  I guess there was, like, a college player.  He's seven foot seven.  He got that dumb Mercer.  Yeah, this guy is the...  Tim was walking around casually.  He had it for about a week.  This guy's seven foot seven.  He was the biggest prospect to come out of junior college.  He was playing center for UNC Asheville, something like that, a junior college, but ready to  break in, scoring, blocking, doing everything. 
[00:21:30]  He goes to one of those basketball camps in the summer and gets MRSA, that staph infection.  They had to amputate half his foot.  MRSA?  How do you get that?  It hangs around in gyms.  It lives a lot in gymnasiums.  It's this super staph that is resistant to antibiotics, and it's really nasty.  That's the one that a couple kids on Long Island got that were on the news.  From my high school, Harborfields had a little Mercer problem.  They don't want that.  You get that from a barefoot somewhere? 
[00:22:00]  Well, it lives in sweat, and it travels on your body, and it can get on the equipment.  Not much sweat on the equipment.  No, that's why they're all spraying.  It doesn't wipe it down and spray it or something.  Well, does it live for a while after you leave?  Because you have to wipe down the equipment.  It does.  So that's why they're going crazy now, spraying all these things.  And then by spraying it, they'll mutate it so it'll be impervious to the spray, and  it'll crawl out on its own power and become visible and just beat you up.  Like, that's what I'm waiting for to happen.  Because no matter what good we make, like antibiotics and the Purell and everything, 
[00:22:30]  they're like, all this is doing is making super bacteria.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they said.  Everybody taking all the antibiotics for all these years made this Mercer resistant to  it.  So it's a massive problem.  What's with this learning stuff that these stupid bacteria and viruses and everything  have?  They learn.  It's like, oh, we finally figured out how to thwart this.  You don't have a brain.  Just be a cell and stop.  They learn with no schooling. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Which is even creepier.  Yeah.  They don't even have to sit through boring classes year after year.  They just learn on their own.  One day, like, an antibiotic comes up and goes, I'm going to kick your ass.  I go, no.  No.  Yeah.  Sorry.  You're not doing anything to me.  I'm just going to go and take this guy's foot.  Yeah.  Half his foot.  What are you doing?  You're 7'7".  That just sucks.  His whole life was to make it in basketball, and now they had to take his foot or most of  his foot?  Yeah.  Half his foot is gone.  He had a foot thing on his foot.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  How old was he?  I think he was, like, 19 or 20 years old.  Oh, my God.  Headed to the NBA.  Well, just.  22?  Oh, so he was really headed to the NBA.  So what is that?  Well, maybe headed to the, I mean.  Wow.  But still.  He had a future in pro ball.  What, how do you know you have this?  Like, what exactly is it?  Ask our own Tim.  He walked around with it for a few days.  He goes, ah, they think it might be Mercer.  But we got it under control.  I'm like, why are you here?  We get mad when someone with the flu comes in.  Yeah.  Why are you here with Mercer? 
[00:24:00]  Supposedly.  You can see it.  If it comes on your skin, it's like a lump, and it starts getting really red and hard,  and it blows fast.  It's like a mosquito bite.  Yeah, but it's a little bigger and more aggressive.  And you can usually tell.  How long is it?  Can you get rid of it until you see it in time?  Yeah, but you have to go in and get treatment.  I mean, you really have to get powerful antibiotics on it.  What do you think happened with him?  He just didn't know he had it, or he didn't do anything?  He probably thought it was something else, right?  Yeah, probably thought it was athlete's foot or something, and then by that time, boom.  I have the heebie-jeebies.  Spectro from Michigan wants to correct stunt brain. 
[00:24:30]  He's only 7'3 now, so.  Oh!  Let's say hi to Bob.  Ah!  That's Mercer?  Where is that?  I never want that.  Is that his underarm?  There's a huge hole that looks like it could fit a baseball.  Holy son of a...  I can't look at that.  In his underarm region.  Really?  That's Mercer?  Yeah.  Oh, that's just wonderful.  M-R-S-A.  It's something staff-resistant.  You know, we like to encourage people to, like, Google stuff. 
[00:25:00]  Don't Google Mercer.  You're not going to enjoy what you see today.  Oh.  How do you get it under your arms?  I don't know.  Wherever...  Look at this.  There's just holes in these people.  Ew.  Oh, my God.  It looks for an opportunity if you have, like, a cut to go in there and start taking up residence.  Look at that.  Look at that.  That's not that bad.  This is weird.  I'm not looking.  I can't.  Why?  Anthony, look.  Because it's so disturbing.  But this one's easy.  Oh, you son of a bitch.  If it's a black guy or a Spanish guy...  Yeah, that one's an easy one.  It looks like a bullet wound. 
[00:25:30]  A huge bullet wound.  Like, of howitzer.  Yeah, there you go.  Will it kill you?  You could put a golf ball into that.  Ugh.  Yeah, you can.  You could, like, kind of, like, you know, play the break off his chest, and it'll be  a left...  It'll break left.  But I think you can make the putt.  God, I would hate to have that.  I don't want that.  Let's go to Bob in Cleveland.  Bob?  Hey, Opie.  I wanted to give you a bright ray of sunshine this morning.  Welcome to the Cleveland disgruntled and completely worthless sports fan club.  Yeah, you guys...  You guys... 
[00:26:00]  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Bob.  Bob.  No, no.  That's all right.  I'll cut you off at any point.  No, I think I'm...  I think this time I cut you off.  Yeah, Cleveland's had it bad for many, many years.  But I love that LeBron James.  It's going to be a shame when he moves on after his contract's up, huh?  Yeah, I wonder where he's going to move to, huh?  He is so not staying in Cleveland.  You know that, right?  I might chip in a few dimes just to make...  You know, just to put it over the top so he stays.  He wants to play in a huge market.  He wants to be like a New Jersey Net or a Nick or... 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  I don't know what other team could really go for him.  Boston or L.A. maybe?  Maybe L.A.  He so wants out of Cleveland.  He makes believe he loves Cleveland.  He's from there.  But he's got his sights on bigger markets.  What kind of cut do you think he's going to take to go somewhere else big?  Probably a huge cut because then he'll make it back in endorsements.  The phone's exploded on...  We were talking about Mercer.  Bob, we've got to move on.  We'll talk about Cleveland sports another day.  We've got Mercer calls coming.  Is it Mercer or Mercer? 
[00:27:00]  Mercer.  Mercer.  Sorry.  I'm thinking Bobby Mercer.  Tom the Trucker.  How are you, Tom?  I'm doing fine, fellas.  I just want to let little Jimmy know that I'm a 350-pound, 6'1'' truck driver.  I don't work out in no gyms.  I caught the Mercer probably from a shower.  The Mercer.  What's that?  So what happened?  Where'd you get it?  You can get it in showers.  One of those trucker showers, I bet.  Well, those are clean, right? 
[00:27:30]  You get it in gyms.  You get it in gyms.  You get it in showers.  If a guy's got this stuff, this is how contagious it is.  He can scratch it.  Go eat a buffet and he can spread it out to people in there.  It's very contagious.  Where on you was it and how did you get rid of it?  I ended up in the hospital for two weeks.  Where'd you have it on you?  I had it right in my groin, right at the top of my groin.  Everybody said it was from some of the girls I hung around with like you do. 
[00:28:00]  Wait a minute.  Was it by your testicles or on your leg?  Looks like right above.  No, sir, right there where your carotid artery is, right above there.  Right there in the V.  In the V where the legs meet the torso?  No, literally right above.  Exactly.  And it came up like a staph infection.  As a matter of fact, they lanced it the first time for a staph.  I was out for a week.  I went to another place to have it looked at and repacked.  They said to see a surgeon when I went home. 
[00:28:30]  I got home like two days later.  The doctor put me in the hospital.  He said, you'll see a surgeon in the morning.  They went and cut again on it.  So do you have a hole in that area now?  Well, no.  No, it's healed up.  But it has to heal from the inside out.  And like you said, antibiotics, it's only treated with something called Bactrim.  I mean, you can't even eat with a crab.  It's nasty bacteria.  But they give you intravenously and they give you this Bactrim and this other stuff. 
[00:29:00]  And then once they start working on the sword, you have to take whirlpool therapy.  I'm not leaving my house.  That's it.  Yeah.  I'm doing the show from my house.  This is the last straw, right?  I'm never leaving my house now.  Let me tell you what you need to do.  Carry you some Clorox and water.  Yeah.  Wash your hands all the damn time.  Carry the Purell.  The Purell.  The Purell.  Well, sir, you got it on your groin.  You're not going to rub Purell on your groin. 
[00:29:30]  No, you might.  Oh, yeah.  In a pinch.  I don't know.  I hear the...  The guy that was in the hospital with me, he had it under his nutsack.  Nice.  What the hell are you guys doing on the road?  I know.  The one guy had it on his nose.  Right.  Right.  I hear that.  I just want to let you know, man.  It's something not to mess with.  I ain't going to lie to you.  And like I said, I'm clean.  I use the Lysol, the shower shoes, everything else in the showers.  But I picked it up. 
[00:30:00]  Like I said, a guy can scratch, wipe it on the damn doorknob or whatever, and you can get it.  There you go.  We all got to wear gloves.  I hear the best thing for those open wounds is to just pour pure alcohol on it.  Ow.  Fill it up like a shot.  Put a shot of Jaeger in there and drink it out of his Mercer hole.  Can I imagine the burn of pouring alcohol on a Mercer wound?  The worst burn, like our stories about wounds I ever heard was when Pryor described his burns on his chest. 
[00:30:30]  And when they're fresh, when you're burned, like when your skin is raw, like chopped meat,  they have to give you like a wire brush scrubbing to keep it from getting infected.  Oh, wow.  Burn victims have to get scrubbed with a hard brush.  Maybe that's why their eyes are so wide.  It's just, ow, ow.  That's where their eyes go when they see you walking with the brush.  Yeah.  Oh.  Are you doing some driveway scraping today?  Let's go to Nurse Heather.  Nurse Heather, you're on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:31:00]  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  I have not heard Stuntbrain be so wrong.  Oh, thank God.  I guess you're not a regular listener.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stuntbrain's dumb.  We all know that.  What do you got, Nurse Heather?  He's following the media hype from MRSA.  Yep.  It's resistant to penicillin, and all of the doctors failed to actually take a bacterial  cure and find out that it's actually one of these bugs and treat it with the wrong antibiotic 
[00:31:30]  first.  And that truck driver must have been one of them 300-pound truck drivers who got it in  his nuts and, you know, sat around sweating all day long and not being able to keep it clean,  and that's why it raged the way it did.  All right.  Well, we got every phone ringing.  Everyone paranoid, scared.  They have their MRSA stories.  Is this...  So you just take a little penicillin and it goes away?  No, no, no.  It's resistant penicillin.  Oh, resistant.  I'm sorry.  Okay. 
[00:32:00]  So all the amoxicillin and, you know, the common antibiotics that they treat everything  for is what they end up giving everybody first because it just looks like a little pimple  or a cyst, and they don't pay attention to it.  If they just culture it the first time around and find out that it is one of these penicillin-resistant  bugs, then they would treat it with the correct antibiotic first, and it wouldn't be such a drama  story, but nobody's doing... 
[00:32:30]  All right.  What do we do if we get it?  Well, first of all, when you get it, you won't know you get it because it doesn't come  up on your skin like some foreign body or some, you know, alien that's growing on your  skin.  It comes up like a little, like a little cyst, like a big, like a big pimple or a zit.  Don't play with it.  Oh, my goodness.  What do you do with it?  Don't play with it.  All right.  We got the pimple now.  Now what?  Don't play with it.  Now what?  When you go to the doctor, ask them to culture it, and don't let them give you something 
[00:33:00]  like penicillin or amoxicillin or one of those generic.  They have to give you Bactrim or even vancomycin.  Is there a doctor in the house?  Why are we getting advice from a nurse?  You pulled out a 1940s line.  Is there a doctor in the house?  Some guy with a black bag who shows up.  Cigarette breath.  Oh, Obama?  What? 
[00:33:30]  We need a doctor.  We need a doctor.  Good luck.  She cleans bedpans.  We need someone that knows what they're talking about.  Yeah.  Now we got everyone paranoid.  John in Brooklyn.  How are you, John?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Congratulations on the book, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  Yeah.  I hate your guts.  I'm just switching gears a little bit from the MRSA.  Okay.  Another stupid sports story.  The guy out in one of the mountain states, I think Colorado, a football player, suffered  some horrible injury to his pinky. 
[00:34:00]  And he's such a devoted player.  He wants to play.  He told the doctors to amputate his pinky so he could play the rest of the season rather  than just become disabled for the whole season.  Well, I mean, that's one thing.  But this guy was like 22.  And when you lose half your foot, a basketball player probably couldn't play without a pinky.  But without a foot, you're finished.  Yeah.  And you can't do a lot of things without a foot.  Yeah.  That just sucks.  Oh, lucky us.  We get to see the 57-yard field goal all day long here in New York. 
[00:34:30]  All day long.  God.  Those never go.  Raiders over the Jets in overtime.  All day long.  I've seen the field goal 10 times.  We've been here for less than an hour.  Kick the football through a Mercer hole.  Right.  I kick that out of my head now.  Mercer, what a great place to store your candies.  Your friend, if he has Mercer in his stomach, could you stay there?  I have a company coming over.  I want to store it in your Mercer hole.  A Mercer candy dish for my company.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  Dr. Mark in Philly.  By the way, go Phillies.  I'm pulling hard for the Phillies.  Let's go, Mark.  Mercer, there's 100% on the bar.  It's the antibiotics they're currently treating it with in the early stages that aren't effective because it's being misdiagnosed so much.  But when it gets to the more progressive stages, there are surgical means to resect it, to treat it locally with antibiotics, where it does go away quite easily.  So do you think that this guy, this kid who had his foot, this 22-year-old, just waited way too long? 
[00:35:30]  That's exactly it.  A lot of times people don't have great feeling in the bottom of their feet, and it starts off very small, and it's very aggressive.  It starts opening up as a big sore, basically, as an ulceration on the bottom of the foot.  So you get it early, you're going to be cured of this thing.  You're going to be fine.  All right.  He probably thought his tootsies were just sore.  Like, he had probably, you know, an athlete, you probably get little sores on your feet.  Oh, I'm just going to...  I know I get them on my right hand.  Yeah.  Run to the hospital now for any little blemish. 
[00:36:00]  Well, I'd love you to have Mercer come in with no leg.  No.  It happens.  I hate having that.  I would never want that.  I have Mercer where the leg meets the torso.  They had to take the whole kit and caboodle off.  Or just the leg comes in and the rest of you get thrown out.  Guys, I got to jump off here.  All right.  Thanks, Don.  All kit and caboodle.  This is a doctor coming in with that technical jargon.  We had to take the whole kit and caboodle.  That's a word you don't hear in federal prison that often.  Kit and caboodle. 
[00:36:30]  Do you come here on a Monday with no leg and make believe, you know, nothing happened to you over the weekend?  Yeah, just don't mention it.  Right.  Keep it under your hat.  Come on, guys.  Keep the Paltok cameras up.  Let's go to Jason and Flora, the home of the exciting Rays that are going to be in the World Series against the Phillies.  Wow.  Go Rays.  What's up, Jason?  Morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hey.  Actually, I got Mercer about two years ago.  I took a week off from work and was going to pick up my girlfriend the day before. 
[00:37:00]  I had a little pimple on my face.  So I'm taking at it absentmindedly.  And then the next morning when I'm going to pick her up at the airport, huh, that's my face all stiff.  Why is it filling up with mucus?  So I pick her up and for the next three days it keeps on getting bigger and bigger and filling up with just leaking out nasty pus and everything.  She's like, um, maybe we should take you to the doctor.  I'm like, oh, no, just go to CVS.  CVS.  Maybe you should take him to the doctor. 
[00:37:30]  So was she giving you a kissy, a kiss of your mucus-y, Mercer face?  Yeah.  The end result was, yeah.  I thought I figured out I loved her because she's still with me, actually.  Half your face has been sliced out.  How big of a mark did it leave on your face?  He just has a mouth now.  He's talking through it.  Exactly.  He's right over his tie.  He looks like two-faced.  A snazzy little tie and his mouth and everything else rotted away.  His vocal cords and just all lipless teeth chit-chit-chattering. 
[00:38:00]  It swallowed up to about the size of a grapefruit, and they cut me, actually, in the pimple.  They made that large, and then they cut me about an inch above it, and then just shot me full of novocaine,  and then just start, like, squeezing my face in.  God damn.  Oh, wow.  Just trying to drain all this pus and everything.  My girlfriend's sitting there with her hand in her mouth just freaking out. 
[00:38:30]  And then what did they do?  Oh, they added, actually, string gauze in between the two wounds underneath my face  to keep the wound open so it would drain.  I can't.  I can't.  What an enchanting dinner date you must have been with your draining pus face.  Contagious and draining all over the centerpiece.  Where'd you go on vacation?  I'd just taken a week off of work, and I got a hotel in Sarasota.  Oh, so there you are on the beach trying to watch the sunset. 
[00:39:00]  As your puss is dripping onto the sand.  Girl, an old Bavarian cream face.  Yeah.  Tried to go to Calcutta.  They said he was too disgusting.  He had to leave.  They turned him back at the border.  You can't come into this asshole.  Well, that's a great story, Jason.  Wonderful for Monday.  All right.  We're going to take one more, and then we're going to be in an agreement that we just make  believe we didn't even talk about this horrific thing. 
[00:39:30]  Please.  I'm cringing here.  With that said, we got either Mercer on the back of my head, brother got Mercer from sharing  tattoo, ointment, friend got Mercer from karate, or had Mercer on my back.  We take one more.  Mercer Poe.  I say either on my back or back of my head.  Which one do you want?  Back of the head, because then it'd be fun to hear who else had it in the palm of their 
[00:40:00]  hand.  Bill in Brooklyn.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I had, like two and a half years ago, gotten started out like a little bump behind  my ear, and within two days, the thing blew up.  I mean, like a softball.  It was extreme pain.  I'd gone to the doctor.  He's like, ah, it's just nothing.  So I waited.  What kind of doctor?  It's nothing.  Yeah, exactly.  Put another hat on it.  A regular GP. 
[00:40:30]  And next day, the thing's getting even bigger.  I end up in your going to the emergency room, and they're like, oh, yeah.  You've got to go in for surgery, like, immediately.  Like, there's things in your bloodstream, like the whole back of my neck, and when I  turn red, it's septic, you know.  It's like, if you don't get this removed, it gets into your bloodstream, gets to your  heart, you're dead.  It's like, wow.  You know, and they cut the thing open.  I had a big hole in the back of my head.  Not good stuff.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  I just want to go in now and wash my hands and everything.  Yeah.  I don't.  I have such heebie-jeebies.  I'm itchy.  Why?  You're going to get it going into the bathroom.  You're going to touch the handle, and you'll be Mercer Boy.  I don't want to be Mercer Boy.  How would that be?  You're in a big mansion.  Go ahead, sir.  You just saw Bob and shut it.  Rotting away.  Yeah.  You get up to go to the kitchen from the living room, and your ass is just on the couch  still.  Two little supple buttocks cheeks. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  Thank you, Bill and Brooklyn.  Now we've got a nurse mad at us.  She's in Boston.  Danielle, what's up?  No, I'm not mad at you at all.  All right.  The nurse and the doctor were both right.  MRSA is something.  It actually stands for methicillin-resistant staph aureus.  Oh.  And it is a result of using human antibiotics.  There are several medications that can treat it, but you do have to culture each individual  wound to see what medication will cure it.  Pat from Monaco is saying culture the wound. 
[00:42:00]  Do you take it to the ballet?  Yeah.  You're an ass, Pat.  You're going to put a little viewing glass in front of the wound so it can see.  With some opera glasses.  Yes, because the wound hates when it can't see.  Get your MRSA seat at Carnegie Hall.  Yeah.  Get some culture.  Or can you just bring a tiny little seat and put it on your lap?  Yeah.  You have to buy a whole seat for your MRSA.  A little MRSA zit.  Danielle, sounds like you want to be a doctor.  No, I don't really want to be a doctor.  You've got some knowledge as far as a nurse goes. 
[00:42:30]  Well, yeah.  I've been a nurse for like 11 years.  But doctors are typically the ones, unfortunately, that spread it.  They have a bad habit of not washing their hands.  How can doctors not wash their hands in this day and age?  Seriously, watch.  I've worked in too many hospitals and you see them going from room to room not washing their hands.  We're a lot better at it than they are.  My grandfather actually had abdominal surgery a few years ago and the wound got infected and it ended up being MRSA.  And they had to excise a large section of his abdomen and then treat it with this awful thing called a wound vac that, like the trucker said, healed the wound from the inside out. 
[00:43:00]  But it just basically just was like this thing sucking on his stomach trying to get that.  It was horrifying.  A wound vac?  Yeah.  What is it?  Vacuuming the parson?  I can't take this.  Do you know what's depressing?  That somewhere someone's going, what do you do for a living?  And he's going, well, I make wound vacs.  The wound vac?  That's me.  There's a guy who makes them for a living.  And he's proud.  He's very proud.  That was me. 
[00:43:30]  How are you going to eat, Jimmy?  Jimmy's got a big egg omelet in front of him, egg white omelet.  No, no, no.  It's not an egg white omelet.  It is an egg white omelet, but inside, it looks like a Mercer wound.  Now you just opened it.  It looks like a Mercer wound.  It's an egg white omelet with tomatoes in there.  Let's all eat breakfasts that look like Mercer wounds.  Jimmy's got the best ones.  That looks like a Mercer wound.  Yeah.  It certainly does.  I would eat that on the head of a Mercer patient.  I could care less. 
[00:44:00]  Give me Mercer or give me death.  You are really something.  Yeah, Mercer rules.  My new bumper sticker.  I'm selling that.  All right.  With that, we're going to take a break.  Hey, intern Dave, we're going to do a little kosher sports today.  We haven't done that in a week or so.  That's on the way.  Got to talk about good old Colin Powell.  Yes.  He was on with Tom Brokaw.  Hopefully, we have some audio of Brokaw trying to say Colin Powell.  Colgan.  Colgan.  Colgate.  Phone number 877-212-0&A. 
[00:44:30]  We are going to move on from Mercer.  I'm washing.  Sonny Ferrelli's all paranoid now.  Everybody's like, holy ass.  So now we're going to take a break and make believe we didn't even talk about that.  Okay?  That's the deal we make with you.  I want to be in a plastic bubble.  Bubble boy.  I want to be bubble boy.  He walked outside at the end of the movie.  It was so nice.  Yeah.  He just needed to.  Did he die?  Of course.  You knew he was going to die.  John Travolta's bubble boy?  I don't know.  I mean, they left you hanging, didn't they?  Yeah, but you kind of assumed it was over, Johnny. 
[00:45:00]  He had to live his life no matter what, and he took the walk into the crummy backyard.  Yeah.  Right?  Wasn't it the...  Whatever.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Say good morning to everybody.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Can I tell you how funny Jim Florentine is?  Yeah, what happened?  I got a...  We were talking about Cialis or whatever, and apparently he tried it.  Oh, no.  I don't think he needs it, but he just did.  And he goes, it was great. 
[00:45:30]  First time I took it today.  Awesome.  I got a rod looking at a homeless guy.  Send me a text.  He's coming on the show soon, right?  Yeah, I can't wait.  Finally.  It's about time, Jim.  Jim Florentine will be on the show in the very near future.  Instant feedback, some really good ones.  I know we're moving on, but you just got to, like, this is the mop-up.  Yeah.  You do a little mop-up through instant feedback after we do a break.  Spectro from Michigan writes, I wish my giant wife would get a little MRSA. 
[00:46:00]  Scott M. from Seattle writes, who are these morons who wait until their infections are the size of produce  until they seek professional help?  Retards.  The size of a grapefruit or an orange.  And then we were talking about, you know, Anthony losing a leg, and, you know, would he just come in on a Monday  and try to make believe nothing happened to him over the weekend?  No, it would be horrible.  I would never want that.  Well, not really.  Vince from Bayonne writes, if Anthony lost a leg, he'd just put a shoe on his schlong, and you'd never notice.  Yes, you would. 
[00:46:30]  It'd be silly.  You'd have to take Stialis, you know.  Yeah.  To make sure you could walk.  Goose-stepping like a Nazi.  All right.  877-212-ON-A.  Wow, that W movie didn't do well.  No.  I think everybody's sick of the Bush, and nobody cares.  I had no desire to see that.  I didn't.  It's a very tough audience to bring into that.  I mean, who are you gunning for there?  Yeah.  People that are like, oh, I'm politically minded, and I kind of want to know.  We know what Bush is like, and what he did, and it's not like any surprises there, I don't 
[00:47:00]  think.  People are thinking about Obama or McCain.  They want to move on.  This would have been a big one in between, like, first and second term.  Yeah.  I think it's not that brave to do the movie as he's leaving office.  Oliver Stone, I mean, he's supposed to be this edgy, liberal guy.  He should have done the movie a year ago.  Two years ago, right?  The timing seems weird.  Three different people asked me, you want to go see W?  I'm like, no.  I have no desire.  But that dumb dog movie is still doing really well. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, God.  And Max Payne, which got horrible reviews, was the number one movie in America.  Mm-hmm.  Max Payne, Beverly Hills Chihuahua.  That Chihuahua movie is still just, why don't they just make, like, a ton of those movies?  Because, you know, the parents take the kids to it.  Mm-hmm.  They throw a little adult humor in there for the parents that bring the kids, you know.  And then before you know it, lots of millions.  And then the broads, I guess, all went to see The Secret Life of Bees. 
[00:48:00]  Ew, what is that?  What is that?  And also small breasts.  I'm always looking for...  That's really funny.  What does stop me in my tracks?  What does Bs do when they fall asleep?  How they run around and pretend they're Cs?  They mush themselves together while the girl's sleeping?  Their secret little life.  Beat up the A's?  Although, my favorite, Dakota Fanning, I believe, is in that.  Yes, she is, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, she is.  What is that about, that movie? 
[00:48:30]  I really don't know.  I know it was a popular book that I had no desire ever to read.  I'm always looking for a book to read.  And that dumb secret life of bees is always staring you in the face.  Is it?  Yeah.  What is The Secret Life of Bees all about, Stump Brain?  It's one of those chick-lit books.  Another chick-lit book that I have the same issue that you do.  I can't pick it up.  What do you mean a chick?  What do you call it?  Chick-lit.  You know, girl books.  What's chick-lit?  L-I-T mean?  Chick-literature. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, chick-lit.  Yeah, there's a whole category.  Don't ever use chick-lit on our show again.  I can't believe you haven't heard that.  I read the one about ex-wives.  The Secret Life of Cs.  Now that's a book worth reading.  Yeah, it's a great book.  That's hilarious.  Someone should write that book.  Just get stories of ex-wives and put it in one nice book for everyone to enjoy.  And there's a certain biography, The Secret Life of N. 
[00:49:30]  Very nice.  Colin Powell.  Yes.  That's huge.  Huge.  Colin Powell.  Endorsing Obama.  You know something, though?  I wouldn't put too much behind that.  Because he hates Bush and pretty much the Republicans so much at this point for putting him up there like an ass to recite lies in the United Nations that he doesn't care. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  I think he was buddy-buddy with McCain, though, down there in Washington.  He's so disgusted with Republicans.  Here's how it went down as we were enjoying our weekends.  We've got two individuals.  Either one of them could be a good president.  But which is the president that we need now?  Which is the individual that serves the needs of the nation for the next period of time?  And I come to the conclusion that because of his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities, and we have to take that into account, as well as his substance. 
[00:50:30]  He has both style and substance.  He has met the standard of being a successful president, being an exceptional president.  I think he is a transformational figure.  He is a new generation coming into the world, onto the world stage, onto the American stage.  And for that reason, I'll be voting for Senator Barack Obama.  Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:51:00]  Mediocre Gatsby.  That's very funny.  Mediocre Gatsby.  Is the guy's name?  Yeah.  He's not great.  He's just mediocre.  Oh, that's funny.  That is good.  Mediocre Gatsby.  Other people are putting out Ron Kind.  He's the wrong kind.  That would be great if Paul just endorsed somebody that's not even running to some dork.  Like, Ron Kind.  The wrong kind. 
[00:51:30]  I think that's big, though.  Even though he's mad at them, it's like, he's a respected enough guy.  Yeah.  A lot of white people were saying he should run for president years ago before, you know,  he was the puppet for Bush.  Oh, it was terrible.  Ruined his credibility right there.  He was, you know, he had great credibility.  And that was it.  Yeah, there's roving chemical trucks driving around.  It's like some Iraqi ice cream truck.  Yeah, just trying to give ice cream to the kids. 
[00:52:00]  Iraqi tunes playing.  Kids running up for a big buddy.  It's 120 degrees, and all they want is ice cream, and we think it's something else.  Bomber.  Well, you kind of missed that one, huh?  Yeah, oops.  And then what, Obama did 100,000 in St. Louis?  100,000 people?  Hey, really?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's his.  But what's going on with those big rallies?  They're giving out something for free.  That has nothing to do with people that are psyched about his platform or anything.  It's just he's now this huge, huge celebrity. 
[00:52:30]  He's a rock star.  So people will come out to see him.  There's the picture.  Look at that.  As far as the eye can see.  That's a lot of white people.  That's a lot.  A lot of white people in there.  It's St. Louis, man.  Well, yeah.  That's a very.  Old St. Louis?  I thought there were a lot of.  Well, they got their blacks, but they.  I have no idea.  It was.  An old St. Louis.  Reminds me of my favorite song.  Why don't you meet me in St. Louis, Louis?  Who doesn't hum that every once in a while? 
[00:53:00]  Nobody.  Meet me at the fair.  That song should be firebombed.  It's a terrible song.  Who's Louis?  Who wants to meet that queer at a fair in St. Louis?  Meet abroad.  So what are you saying?  He's a rock star?  Yeah, he's a rock star.  So the people come out to see him just to say, like, wow, I saw the guy.  Yeah.  Like, you know, stupid Bono gets up and there's that many people.  So he's kind of, you know, he's like in that category now. 
[00:53:30]  You know what's funny?  Probably most of those people aren't even voting.  They're just.  Yeah.  They're just going with the hype.  Let's go check out Obama.  Check out this rock star.  Yeah.  You think he's got it now or what?  It's so weird.  He's still a black guy.  I think the.  In America.  The only thing that could stop him is what Patrice said.  The fact that.  The Bradley effect.  Yeah.  Just lying and saying, yes, I'm voting for him.  The polls show him ahead.  But you see crowds like that.  Again, I don't know if they're voting for him, but, you know, the guy sure knows how to 
[00:54:00]  draw people in.  Oof.  I really think, though, he's going to he's going to win.  And the Republican ticket.  It's not like he's up against a great Republican candidate.  Like, yeah, McCain's an OK candidate.  And I think he's a good guy.  But Palin.  Mediocre candidate.  Yeah.  Mediocre.  Mediocre.  It's not a great.  You know, if he had McCain had like if Colin Powell would run as his VP, then Obama had  a major problem.  But, you know, his VP is not that strong. 
[00:54:30]  So people are.  Everyone's looking at her really like, or or Mitt Romney.  Yeah.  Somebody.  They're really looking at her.  Like when you have a guy that is that old and a lot of people are questioning whether  he's going to be around for four years, you better pick a legit VP candidate because now  everyone say if if if McCain was a young guy, you wouldn't care.  You just vote for the president.  Yeah.  Vote for the president.  Now they're voting for two presidents. 
[00:55:00]  They're voting for him and her.  Yeah.  It was a dumb move.  He should have really gotten just a really qualified person.  It wasn't a woman.  I don't know.  He went with some kind of gag ticket trying to offset the Hillary numbers is what they  were doing.  All that Hillary hype and everything.  It would all went away.  No one thinks about it anymore.  And now you got you're stuck with this broad dolt.  She's a phenomenon, man.  People want to check her out, but they don't want to vote for the ticket to goof factor. 
[00:55:30]  SNL had the highest ratings in 14 years.  She was on Saturday.  They did ridiculous numbers.  I don't know what the next.  So whatever she does, people want to check out, but they just don't want to vote for  that ticket, it seems like.  What was that show 14 years ago that actually got those numbers?  I think it was 14 years ago, right?  They said 14 years ago, but it's like, what was that show?  Which one?  It was the Nancy Kerrigan appearance, I believe, after the clubbing.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay, so that's not very impressive.  I was something cool.  I was one of a few that just didn't want to watch that Sarah Palin on SNL. 
[00:56:00]  We got a couple of really quick clips.  Alec Baldwin approaches Sarah Palin, and Lorne Michaels, he thinks Sarah is Tina Fey.  See, because...  Ah, because she's been doing the...  Yeah.  Hey, Lorne.  Hey, Tina.  Lorne, I need to talk to you.  You can't let Tina go out there with that woman.  She goes against everything we stand for.  I mean, good Lord, Lorne.  They call her...  What's that name?  They call her Cara... 
[00:56:30]  Cara...  What do they call her again, Tina?  Oh, that'd be Caribou Barbie.  Caribou Barbie.  Thank you, Tina.  I mean, this is the most important election in our nation's history, and you want her,  our Tina, to go out there and stand there with that horrible woman?  What do you have to say for yourself?  Alec, this is Governor Palin.  Hi there.  I see.  Forgive me, but I feel I must say this.  You are way hotter in person. 
[00:57:00]  Jesus Christ, this is for the vice presidency.  I know.  It's not like a goofy, wacky thing.  It's pretty important.  Hey, she wins in the end.  Her profile goes way up after this whole thing.  Self-deprecation is always great.  People love it.  Plus, I mean, obviously, they would have told him that that wasn't Tina.  Oh.  Oh, literal, Jimmy.  I like this.  It was pretty funny.  Except they said Tina 40 times.  You got it, Alec.  We understand.  Okay, Tina. 
[00:57:30]  You think it's a mix-up.  It's 1973.  Yeah.  Oh, I thank you.  I mean, seriously.  I mean, I can't believe they let her, you know, play you.  Oh, thank you.  And I must say, your brother Stephen is my favorite Baldwin brother.  You are a delight.  Now, come, let me take you for a tour of the studio.  You know I've hosted the show how many times, Lauren?  175 times.  175 times.  Alec Baldwin is great, though.  Yes, he is. 
[00:58:00]  He's great on that show.  He's great on 30 Rock.  Great on the phone.  Huh?  Great on the phone.  Great at parenting.  What a douche.  Great on the phone.  He is great on the phone.  You and him have a lot in common, man.  Why?  The hate for the ex.  His hate for his ex is legendary.  And then, finally, the real Sarah Palin interrupts fake Sarah Palin's press conference.  And so you've got Tina Fey playing Sarah Palin, and then, you know, they do the old switcheroo. 
[00:58:30]  The old switcheroo.  To get the big holy cow effect.  To answer your question, you know, I don't worry about the polls.  Polls are just a fancy way of systematically predicting what's going to happen.  The only poll I care about is the North Pole, and that is melting.  It's not great.  What?  The real one?  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, what just happened? 
[00:59:00]  I wonder.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this is going on.  Did Norton just walk in, or Audrey Meadows?  Thank you.  No, I'm not going to take any questions.  Kramer!  But I do want to take this opportunity to say, live from New York, it's Saturday night!  Good for them.  Yeah.  Bravo.  I've had enough.  I've got to be honest.  I've had enough of candidate charm.  I don't want them going on SNL anymore.  I don't care if you're a funny actor. 
[00:59:30]  No.  If you're engaging.  Just stop sucking as a politician.  Exactly.  Two weeks to go.  That's it.  Two weeks.  15 days, right?  Yep.  Let's say hi to Dennis in Michigan.  Dennis?  How you doing, boys?  Good, Dennis.  You guys got plugged on Hannity Friday on his radio show.  What was he saying?  He was taking Obama-lover phone calls, and the Obama-lover said that Hannity was the funniest  thing on the radio besides O&A.  Hannity replied, he liked Opie and Anthony, but he was no Jim Norton. 
[01:00:00]  Ah, nice.  Wow.  Very good.  He doesn't have AIDS?  That's right.  And fun.  Go ahead.  I'd love to be a Hannity.  How many stations does he have?  Geez.  About 400.  I'd never tell another joke in my life.  No.  Never.  Yeah, let's go to Rick in Rockland County.  So many syndicated markets.  They all want.  Must be a red-letter day for Jimmy, because he got the big mention that he's been waiting 
[01:00:30]  for on the IMIS program.  Why?  What happened?  He went, uh, IMIS was already lying funny, and they're like, yeah, but he didn't.  And then he goes, well, how about that Jim Norton?  And big boy Rob Bartlett gave you the big plug, plugged your book.  Oh, wow.  And then he told IMIS to go look up Monster Rain.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, listen, uh, Monster Rain, I, uh, I don't know what that is.  Hey, Rick.  Get out, boys.  Well, we appreciate that you're calling us to tell us you're listening to another radio  show right now.  That always makes us feel real good about ourselves and what we do. 
[01:01:00]  I'm a subscriber.  All right.  I'm a subscriber.  Really?  That means he could, you know, check out the show later on a replay or something.  Yes, he can.  Yeah.  Uh, I hate your guts.  Jim Norton's, uh, latest book.  We're, we're holding the first few copies.  Yeah.  Everyone else gets it when?  A week?  No, it's, it's available on election day.  Oh, in two weeks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it's pre-order on Amazon now.  Yeah.  Um, and I'll, I'll be doing book signings, which I'll announce as it gets closer.  Ooh.  And there's, there's a picture of the book, uh, cover on onaradio.com, but New York Time 
[01:01:30]  bestselling author of Happy Endings, Jim Norton, I hate your guts.  And you started explaining what the book is about.  I think for the most part people know, but you said you were so mad at what happened to  Imus that it got you thinking about other people you hate or, I mean, not, I mean, not  that you hate Imus, but the other people, right.  The people that were associated with the Imus thing and how they handled it.  They wanted me to, uh, write another book and they're like, we want it to be a little  different than the first one.  We want it to be like a pop culture thing.  I'm like, well, I don't want to just trash Brittany.  I'm like, let me trash people.  Cause the Imus thing annoyed me so much.  I'm like people that I hated with that, that we've obsessed over on the show. 
[01:02:00]  I just wanted to attack.  Yeah.  So, um, I attacked a lot of them, um, you know, for other things too, you know,  Sharpton, Jackson, Keith Olbermann, Al Roker catches a good beating.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Very good.  I mean, Hillary and, uh, just a bunch of people.  The pregnant man, Steve Martin.  Dr. Phil gets a good kick in the teeth.  Yankee announcer, John Sterling.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Uh, a lot of others.  I don't want to give them all away.  I want some surprises for the people out there, but yeah, a lot of the people, uh, you've heard 
[01:02:30]  Jimmy trash on the show.  Certainly.  Yeah.  I really, it was very, very, uh, cathartic, very healing.  Very excited for you, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  We're going to take a break after the break.  Kosher sports with intern David.  Oh, David.  And I saw one of those, uh, fake tents this weekend.  Oh, you did?  It's a crock of S. It's not a tent.  No.  It's like a wooden structure.  It looks like a shanty.  It looks like something you put in your yard so vines can grow on it.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Or if you're having like an outdoor party.  A trellis.  And you want to keep everyone dry.  It's one of those things.  Mm-hmm.  There's a synagogue in my neighborhood and they've got this giant piece of crap shanty  town attached to the synagogue.  I'm like, what's going on there?  And they had holes and I peeked in and I saw a lot of suffering going on.  Well, yeah.  Well, because that's what they do, I guess.  They sit in there and suffer?  They're just, uh, suffering along for the holiday.  Take a personal interest in watching you suffer.  All scarred up.  Yeah.  We'll find out if that holiday is finally over. 
[01:03:30]  We don't know.  Oh, and speaking of Jews, uh, Rich Voss is here.  Very cool.  Oh, good.  Oh, Voss is getting his teeth yanked out today.  Oh, I hope it's, I hope it's way, by way of fist.  He's going to attempt to fix his mouth again.  A little stammer.  A tremendous stammer.  I had five ways to get to a joke, but should have just been left alone to begin with.  Talk about rushing into an empty room.  I'm here.  Nothing.  Uh, I guess Voss is going to get all his teeth pulled today. 
[01:04:00]  And we're going to try, because we're sending a couple camera guys, and we're going to try  to have Voss do some of his act with no teeth before they start, you know, implanting the  new ones.  Got to hear that.  That would be pretty funny, I'm thinking.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  A busy one today for a Monday.  Cheech and Chong coming in here in a little while?  Yeah, in about an hour.  Nice.  Uh, also, uh, Rich Voss has entered the studio.  Yeah.  Rich is going to be at the Funny Bone in Virginia Beach, October 22nd through the 26th. 
[01:04:30]  Wow.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  Wednesday.  Wow.  Wednesday.  Wait.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  Yes.  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, I do a lot of nights when I work for those people.  That's a long haul.  Go to VABeachFunnyBone.com.  That would be nice.  And you're getting your teeth pulled today?  Yeah, I'm getting, not only am I getting four or five pulled, then they're going to  drill through the gums into the bone and put in implants, okay? 
[01:05:00]  And then hopefully I, you know, and then I have to perform Wednesday night.  Oh, I already slobber, okay?  So do you?  We never notice.  So now, now I'm staring with a slobber and just metal's going to come flying out of my  mouth.  And, you know, uh, just broken gum parts and horrible.  Oh, horrible.  Like, it already bleeds sometimes when I brush my teeth without even the work done.  Really?  Yeah.  Does that happen to you?  No.  That's going to be, that's bad.  Well, the problem is you're brushing too hard, probably, and you got to stop holding the 
[01:05:30]  guy's hips while you're doing it.  Why are you getting this done?  Why?  What's wrong with the teeth?  What's wrong with the teeth you got?  They chew pretty good.  Five cuspid incisor.  It's like my fourth set.  Why?  Because, like, I had bridges, and what was holding them up, the teeth under it, they  were starting to get rotten, you know?  I had bad teeth from a certain age, from cocaine till now. 
[01:06:00]  Like, I used to have these big, I had a big gap in my teeth.  We've seen the old videos.  But I had tooth decay in the middle of the gap, so I had a big black.  What'd you snort the coke off of, Snickers bars?  But I still would pick up girls with just rotten teeth.  Well, of course, because you had the whore bait.  Yeah, I had.  It was in my pocket.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Wow.  So, wait, you have to get, why are you doing a gig two days after?  Like, why not separate, give yourself a week off?  Why are you doing a gig two days after? 
[01:06:30]  One, I'm, I'm, I'm, Bonnie made him.  I booked a gig first before I got the dentist appointment.  Two, I need money.  Three, what the hell?  I did a TV show.  My, they pulled a tooth once in my, or did root canal, and I, it got infected, and it  was all full of pus.  And I went to the dentist that day, and they squeezed the pus out with a plier.  No more pus.  I took a plier, just squeezed, and then I taped a TV show that night.  So, what the hell?  You know, we do comedy when I, you know, perform.  Right, we do it in our mouths to talk. 
[01:07:00]  It would be bad if we were sketch artists.  But the thing is, we chat for a living.  It's kind of hard when you're bleeding and swollen from the gums and face.  I'll do it in my back in the audience.  It's no big deal.  So, you're going to, like, you're going to allow us to videotape while they pull these  teeth out of your mouth?  Yes, I am.  Dr. Gotsman today is going to do the work today.  Can you do some of your classic comedy?  Some of those classic lines we recite all the time without your teeth?  All right.  All right.  Without his teeth.  That would be pretty good. 
[01:07:30]  It's Rich Voss without his teeth performing.  I noticed you had mentioned a dentist, so why don't you mention him again?  Who, Gotsman?  Did I mention him?  Because I know what you're getting at, and I don't blame you.  No.  I might get one of the teeth pulled for free, you Jew.  So, wait.  You're going today.  Now, is he, after Gotsman, who's obviously your favorite dentist, after he pulls, is he  pulling? 
[01:08:00]  Believe me.  I've never felt sorry for a dentist before.  I wish Voss was going to see Zell.  Zell.  Oh, discomfort?  Relief.  Are we trying to pull one of them out right now with, like, pliers?  Just for the radio show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Knowing you're going to a real dentist.  Why don't you get Mangala to do it?  Wow, that would hurt.  Yeah.  So, what are you going to do afterwards?  You having fake ones put in, or, like, how is...  What am I doing afterwards?  Immediately.  I'm just going to linger around the dentist office for a while.  They're drilling, like, instead of bone and Gots, and they're putting, what, an anchor? 
[01:08:30]  No, no, no.  I don't know.  You put in...  Okay, so, say you get implants.  They screw them in or somehow.  Right.  You know, they put them in.  So, they're going to put, like, you know, like, something with a thread in it.  You know, like, say, like, you took a little pipe or something and had threads in it to  put your teeth into.  Whatever.  You should not describe things.  Well, I don't know implants.  Well, this is a process, a procedure you're going to have.  Oh, if you went and got a hit replacement, would you know what the metal was made out 
[01:09:00]  of?  He would, yes.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, titanium.  Everyone knows.  Okay.  You picked the worst example.  That one is, like, actually easy.  Okay.  You were getting a haircut.  Would you know what they were cutting?  Hair.  They put implants in, whatever.  They're anchors to put the studs in.  I guess.  It's kind of like putting fence posts in.  Yeah.  As if enough studs haven't been in that mouth already.  You're going to drill some holes and they're going to anchor it down with some kind of,  like, bonding material and you're going to have teeth that might look normal for once. 
[01:09:30]  But will he have them that day, though?  Because you're doing a gig in two days.  Will he have teeth?  I think so.  I'll have this.  They'll put this back.  This is all fake and they'll take it out.  Oh, really?  And they'll put it back in.  Oh, wait, wait.  They're going to use those still?  These are temporary.  Uh-huh.  You know, they made these.  Oh.  Holtzman, the other dentist, made these.  He does the fine work.  Well, where are the ones that you had?  They cut them up in pieces and ripped them out.  You know, they.  They sold them as, like, scrap porcelain.  Somebody's using them as pillows right now. 
[01:10:00]  He tiles on the shuttle.  Yeah.  See, that's the joke, Rich.  What?  He tiles on the shuttle, not pillows.  Who would want to lie in a hard pillow like that?  I don't know.  I know.  Jesus.  A hard pillow.  All right, Rich.  Rich, we're going to move on.  We got, uh, you can help us with this because we got intern David.  He's going to do a little kosher sports.  Oh, boy.  We, uh, we like our intern David.  Here he comes. 
[01:10:30]  It's time for kosher sports with our host, intern David.  Hello, David.  David.  Is that Matterman's brother?  David, hello.  Hello.  Morning, Dave.  How are you?  Hello, David.  Hello.  Shalom.  Shalom.  Are we done with the, uh, what was, what was it?  The, uh, we forgot the holiday.  Sukkot.  Sukkot.  Is Sukkot done?  No, it's not done.  When is it done?  I got to go to that place and get a camera. 
[01:11:00]  It's done.  Well, the high holidays are going to be ending Wednesday at night.  It's not Wednesday at sundown.  The high holidays are going to be ending.  High holidays.  That's where they build the house.  A little house.  Well, it's supposed to be a tent, but they're cheating.  You're making it a little warmer and a little more.  A kibbutz?  No, a kibbutz is a farm that you work on.  You work on in Israel, yeah.  Okay.  What is it called then?  A kibbutz.  The thing is called Sukkot.  Sukkot.  Yes.  Yes, it's Sukkot.  Well, I know.  My grandfather, he rented his house. 
[01:11:30]  Did he?  What is Sukkot about?  What do you do?  What's the purpose of Sukkot?  The purpose of Sukkot is to remember the feast, the harvest, all the fruits and harvesting  the fruits.  What was the name of the tabernacles?  Yeah, the feast of the tabernacles.  Knuckles.  Are you orthodox?  Tabernacles.  No, I'm not orthodox.  How do you know so much about this?  He's described basically with the holidays.  That's not exactly in-depth knowledge.  I think it's a dumb holiday.  Jews have like 4,000 holidays.  You can describe Christmas. 
[01:12:00]  Ooh, what are you?  Some kind of priest?  Yeah.  Oh, mighty.  Who are you?  Pontius Pilate?  Ow.  David kind of knows about the Jewish heritage.  But people call up and correct him all the time.  Like rabbis call up and go, he's full of crap.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  But then they just repeat what he said.  So I kind of have faith in his faith.  I think he's onto some.  You got this one right.  What's the next Jewish holiday after this?  Well, technically, Sukkot ends Tuesday night at Sunday. 
[01:12:30]  But then Wednesday is a different holiday.  What's up with you guys?  What?  What is it?  Forum, right?  No.  Forum's not until April.  Oh, sorry.  All right.  What's the next holiday?  On Wednesday ends the high holidays with the final holiday.  And what's that?  It's called Simchat Torah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That's the wild one.  What is that one?  That's the wild one.  It's one where you dance in the street.  You carry a Torah and dance around in the street with the Torah and dance in the streets.  That sounds really fun to watch.  That's exciting.  Much as zealots.  Because now you're celebrating the fact that the suffering is over.  Sounds like Freak Kick without the gunfire. 
[01:13:00]  No, it has nothing to do with that.  No.  No?  No.  What is it?  It's celebrating the fact that for the Jewish religion, every Saturday when you go to the  temple, you read the next chapter in the Torah.  So on Simchat Torah, you finish reading the Torah, and then you start reading it all over  again from the beginning.  Is it that good?  Is it a good second read?  So you're celebrating that you're starting to read the Torah all over again from the  beginning.  He's so Jewish.  You know when you go to those white supremacy, gun ranges? 
[01:13:30]  He's just the face that would be on the target.  He's the target.  Wait a minute.  Why are they dancing around with raw sushi?  Who said raw sushi?  No, I did.  And I'll tell you who also wishes he didn't say it.  And because you're commemorating that you're reading the Torah from the beginning, you're  happy about the Torah.  So they go in the streets and they dance around.  They have big parties.  But are you really happy that you're reading it again?  Yeah, boo.  I'm happy. 
[01:14:00]  I'm sure happy about it.  That's why I go around and dance around with the Torah.  I'm sure happy.  Are you?  Most people are not happy they have to read the Torah.  Most people aren't happy they have to read the Bible.  Or carry the Torah.  They're pretty big.  But at night, they run around the towns and dance in the middle of the street.  How many times do you have to read the Torah?  How many times?  You have to read it every year?  So that's like once a year at least.  Every Saturday, you have to read the next chapter.  Every Saturday.  Can you get it on tape?  Well, you know it's coming.  So if you look to be 70-something, you've had to read that damn thing over 70 times? 
[01:14:30]  Well, you go to temple.  If you go to temple every Saturday, you hear it all the time and all the time.  So this holiday celebrates that it's over and you're reading it again from the beginning.  Yuck.  You went to yeshiva, didn't you?  As a kid?  Not a yeshiva, but a conservative Jewish school.  Yeah, he knows too much for like the average Jewish school.  A writer would punch it up or something.  But after you dance with the Torah and you finish it, and then Wednesday night, it's over.  The high holidays are over and there's no Jewish holiday for a few months.  What do you do after you dance with the Torah?  Do you just put it back? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, you put it back.  You put it back and then the next morning you read it from the beginning.  It's like a big celebration because it's the first chapter in the Torah.  That's not fun though.  They make it fun.  They celebrate and they dance and they have a good time.  Are there hookers?  No, there's no hookers.  It's not fun.  Jimmy, they're changing the holiday though this year.  Instead of going back and starting over with the Torah, they're insisting all Jews read  Jim Norton's I Hate Your Guts.  Oh, right.  From beginning to end.  They're going to read that in all the temples?  Yes.  Every Saturday will be another chapter of Jim Norton's book, I Hate Your Guts. 
[01:15:30]  What are they going to do when they finish it?  Read it all over again?  Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.  Dance in the streets with gentlemen who use duct tape to talk.  And they're going to dance in the street holding Jimmy's book?  Yes.  Yes.  That's what's going to happen.  I have an interesting side note about Jimmy's book.  Oh, a little side note.  Yes, a side note.  When I go to Starbucks to get the coffees and the lattes, the guy at the front counter  was going crazy.  Like, do you get that stuff for Jimmy Norton?  I'm like, yeah.  Like, oh, I love Jimmy Norton.  I'm his biggest fan.  I'm reading his book right now.  I want his autograph. 
[01:16:00]  I love Jimmy Norton.  That's the first book.  The second one's not yet.  Right.  Right.  The guy was reading.  He wants your autograph.  The guy at Starbucks.  Thank you.  Don't ever admit that that's what you're doing because now I feel like Jimmy's going to have  MRSA.  Maybe it's a guy that just wanted to make sure he was going to get the MRSA to the right  guy.  Squeeze some MRSA puss in your beverage.  Instead of creamer, here's some MRSA.  I tell him I put in a word for him.  Thank you.  Oh, thanks.  I'll sign something you can give him.  Okay.  Is that a Jewish holiday, MRSA?  No, that's a virus.  Oh, wow.  That's where you dance around with a gaping wound and you hold it up. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, hold up.  You hold up.  Celebrate the wound.  Yeah.  You hold up.  You put a yarmulke over the sore.  Over each hole in your body.  Everybody holds their wives up.  Girls come up from the sore.  Right.  The sore raises the rent of other sores.  I want to talk to Hasidic girls.  Women.  I want to ask them and I want them to be honest if the curly fry look is actually...  The payus.  If it's a turn on or not. 
[01:17:00]  Okay.  I really want one of them to call and go and tell me that really is attractive to them.  Okay.  As you're trying to look for a mate.  Maybe they'll call up.  Do you eat kosher?  Sort of.  What?  You don't put cheese on pork?  What do you mean?  I don't eat pork at all.  No.  Never.  I've never had it in my life.  I just don't dig on swine.  And I don't eat cheese and meat either, no.  What about shellfish?  No, never.  You wouldn't have a lobster?  Never.  I've never eaten it once in my life.  Never?  Never, never. 
[01:17:30]  King crab legs?  Never, never.  Would you eat some of this food for the radio show?  A nice big lobster.  Sam did it.  Or some pork.  Would you eat some pork for the O.P. and Anthony show?  I don't know.  I've never had it in my life ever.  It's good, David.  A lot of it's good.  What do you eat?  Especially the shellfish.  Some pork with lobster sauce?  Anything that's not that.  Hamburger, chicken, hot dog, steaks, regular salmon fish.  Why not shellfish, though?  That's against the Jewish religion.  Why?  Because it's filthy.  Yeah, how come the animal... 
[01:18:00]  Shellfish?  Yeah.  They're in water all the time.  The rule for the...  Bottom feeders?  The rule for the water animal is that it has to have fins and scales.  If there's no fins and scales together at the same time, then you can't eat it.  Wait a minute.  But because the shellfish can't swim...  Shellfish doesn't have fins or scales, so they're no good.  But why?  Why do these fins and scales...  Because that's what it says in the Bible.  Whenever it says in the Bible is what goes.  I know, but not necessarily.  That could have been written by a guy who sold...  Finny and scaly fish. 
[01:18:30]  And he submitted that.  Because you can't get this in there.  Just like the rule for land animals is that it has to have split hooves and chew its cud at the same time.  If not that, no good.  No single hoof to...  It has to be able to do the Watusi.  That stinks.  Split hooves and chew its cud.  So what the hell does it have if we don't eat horses?  A pig has...  Pigs have split hooves, but they don't chew their cud.  So they're no good.  Oh.  They don't chew their what?  Cud.  What?  Chewing their cud is like you eat your food and you chew it, but then you regurgitate it and spit it back out. 
[01:19:00]  That means chewing your cud.  And then you chew it.  Why do they want you to spit your food back out and swallow it?  I don't know, because that's the rule.  I don't know.  I didn't make the rule, though.  Pigs aren't gross.  They swallow their food?  You mean they actually just eat it?  They eat it and they swallow it.  That's why cows are good.  Cows chew their cud and has put hooves, so they're good.  You guys are just complicated.  There's all these rules.  I don't even know.  There's rules for animals that fly in the sky.  There's rules for them, too.  This is the part of the Intern David segment where the other Jews call and say he's wrong about everything.  Of course he is.  What am I wrong about now? 
[01:19:30]  What am I wrong about now?  Did they call to collect?  Yeah, they called to collect.  Like that Arnold from Green Acres.  What am I wrong about now?  I don't know, but rabbis always call up and just call it.  We're accepting their charges.  We've got Donnie in New Jersey.  Donnie.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey.  You know nothing about Judaism, right?  Once again.  Okay.  So first of all, the holiday Sukkot does not end Tuesday night.  It actually ends later on today and the other holiday starts tonight.  And it's not called Simchat Torah.  It's called Shemini At-Sarayat.  There is Simchat Torah.  It's Wednesday. 
[01:20:00]  Well, Simchat Torah is just the second day.  In Israel, they don't even have the second day.  In Israel, there is no such thing as Simchat Torah.  It's only something that's outside Israel.  Well, we have that.  We celebrated.  Yeah, but it's actually not its own holiday.  It's just an extension of Shemini At-Sarayat, which starts tonight, not on Wednesday.  I never said it to me.  I said Simchat Torah started on Wednesday, which it does.  But you made it sound like it was a different holiday.  It is a different holiday.  It certainly is.  It's a holiday celebrating this, reading the Torah from the beginning.  And what is it called?  Simchat Torah.  You know what? 
[01:20:30]  Somebody had a great line.  It's long gone.  But they want to know if that's an add-on to the Sims game.  Because Sim...  By the way, guys, you asked that you wanted to know some stuff about the Hasidic girls.  Yeah.  I know some Hasidic guys.  And, you know, I've heard from them what happens when they get married.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Hasidic girls, you know, in the Hasidic community, they're, like, ultra-sheltered.  And they don't hear anything about sex when they're younger.  Uh-huh.  And a lot of these girls, when they get married, you know, these guys, you know, they go out 
[01:21:00]  and they get, you know, they look at a lot of porno, watch the movies and stuff.  And, you know, they get into from, you know, all this sick stuff.  And then when they get married, I hear from a lot of guys that they are able to convince  their wives that a lot of this, like, you know, crazy stuff is actually the norm.  Wow.  And then they have, like, the most amazing sex lives because their girls will do anything  for them because they think that's the normal way it should be.  That's Simca Torah apart.  Yeah.  And there was a place on 78th Street where Hasidic females went to get clean. 
[01:21:30]  What is that deal?  The Mikva?  What is it?  Oh, hold on.  What is it?  The Mikva?  Yeah, the Mikva.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the deal with that?  What's that?  Basically, that's like, you know, certain times of the month when a woman, you know.  Oh, right.  That she's not considered clean.  So, basically, after she's done with all that, then she's got to go to, like, the ritual bath  to, you know, cleanse herself.  Clean that thing up.  She can't do that at home?  No. 
[01:22:00]  God, this religion doesn't give you any time to go to the movies.  Yeah, you're always doing stuff.  Dancing, cleaning yourself up.  Offering, cleaning, dancing, reading, repeat.  All right.  Thank you, Donnie.  No problem.  Take care, Don.  You must look great.  When they empty out the tubs, it looks like the elevators in The Shining.  Christy in Virginia, I feel like this bit has been chewed up, spit out, and shoved back  down the listeners' ears.  All right.  Let's do kosher sports with In-Time David. 
[01:22:30]  Shalom.  This is B.D. Dave with your kosher sports report.  Big story in baseball, the Rays went from worst to first by being the Red Sox last night  to reach the World Series.  You know, when I was younger, I was a little league catcher.  One year, I had a touchy-feely coach who always checked me for a cup.  Yankees and other baseball news, Yankees pitcher Jabba Chamberlain got arrested over the 
[01:23:00]  weekend for DWI.  I sure would like to party with him.  Know what I mean?  In football, yesterday, the Jets had a heartbreaking loss in overtime.  I always wanted to be a quarterback so I could touch other men's behinds.  Good inflection.  In boxing, Bernard Hopkins beat up on Kelly Pavlik over the weekend.  It sure is refreshing to see two sweaty, muscular men in combat.  That's Kenny written all over it.  In NASCAR, Jimmy Johnson won a race in Mortonsville. 
[01:23:30]  Where the hell is Mortonsville?  Jimmy Johnson is currently the number one NASCAR driver.  Wow.  I think men who can drive really fast are sexy.  In horse racing, the Breeders' Cup is this coming weekend.  I wish I was a stud instead of a gelding.  And aren't jockeys nice?  I love those little fellers.  Oh, Lord.  And finally, and finally, I don't talk about college sports.  Know why? 
[01:24:00]  Because no one would have sex with me when I was in college.  And this has been your culture sports report with me, B.D. Dave.  You know, the kid with the big matzo balls.  Intern David.  Culture sports.  David.  Had a theme to it.  It certainly did have a theme.  Yes.  Obviously written by Kenny.  Yeah, that wasn't really one Jewish reference.  What does that mean, written by Kenny?  Does that mean, did you not like it?  It wasn't one Jewish reference in there.  Not one Jewish reference.  That's correct.  It was a totally new culture sports report. 
[01:24:30]  Did you like your sports today?  It was different.  It was different.  I enjoyed it.  How do you not love David?  Who can not love David?  Aside from Ron.  Nazis.  What do you guys think?  Do you like this version or the older versions?  Whatever you like, I like David.  We think we should send you to Hollywood.  He's like, this guy should be on TV.  He's getting a character on SNL.  There's a lot of directors looking for Jews, man.  You're perfect for any role out there in Hollywood.  I hate to say it because he would be gone, 
[01:25:00]  but if the Daily Show doesn't find some interesting thing for him to do,  he's perfect for a show like the Daily Show.  Definitely.  They're all Jewish at the Daily Show anyways.  Jon Stewart is a Jew.  Very much so.  I've yelled that out on him in the street.  Oh, you have?  No.  Oh, okay.  David, I haven't.  That'd be funny if you did.  Yeah, it would be.  All right, David.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  We're going to take a quick break.  Continue with Rich Voss, who's where? 
[01:25:30]  Funny Bone, Virginia Beach, October 22nd through the 26th.  Well, this is a surprise.  Someone messed up, but we're fine.  We're very happy.  Problem.  It's the Open Anthony Show.  We've got Rich Voss in the studio.  We did not know Mick Foley was coming in today until five minutes ago,  but we're going to show you how professional we are, Mr. Foley.  Well, thank you, Ope.  An old friend of the show, Stoppavai.  He's responsible for some of the best radio we've done in many years. 
[01:26:00]  Mick Foley was the matchmaker that got Jill and Anthony together.  Oops.  The famous Anthony thing.  Well, you know, things happen, Mick.  You heard the ending to the saga, right?  By now?  Well, I heard it was not an especially good one.  No.  For the people that don't know.  That's the way things happen.  And let me just preface this by saying Mick Foley was on Channel 11.  Yeah.  He got interviewed by Jill, and then Jill gave you a message to bring over here to Anthony,  and you happened to do our show next.  You told Anthony what Jill said, and next thing you know, there was a thing that happened. 
[01:26:30]  I'd be walking down the street, and people would be thanking me.  Really?  Yeah, they'd be thanking me for bringing these guys together.  The simple message, I'm single, and I'm interested.  Yeah, that was it.  That was the message.  Well, I don't know.  It just didn't, you know.  In the long run, it didn't pan out.  You know.  Do you know how these things happen, right?  I do know how these things happen.  Yeah.  It's like my relationship with Vince. 
[01:27:00]  See?  Things are going well, and then maybe Vince got a little too demanding of you and your time.  Exactly.  Is that it?  Or Vince, I don't know, had your whole week planned out for you.  He did.  See?  Things like that, when you maybe just want to hang out.  You don't want to be told what to do, Mick.  I think that's where the similarities end, though.  Maybe Vince walked in when another boss of a different wrestling company was in your apartment. 
[01:27:30]  And you tried to put him in the closet.  And Vince opened up the closet door and then took your vehicle.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  It may have been a bad sign immediately when I came over here with the news that you guys  start putting naked photos of her up on the internet.  I don't know if that's ever a good sign for a relationship.  Well, you know.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  And then let's say that the guy from the other wrestling company had, like, the championship  belts there at your house.  And Vince came over one day when you were at work and took him out back and burnt them  all.  Speaking of, well, lay this out for me.  Now you're losing me with all the symbols.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you didn't hear the end of the story.  No, I didn't hear the end of this.  Yeah.  Let's see.  We had a party over my house.  Things were already kind of a little not going well. 
[01:28:30]  This is the one that I was invited to and never responded to.  Yeah.  Probably all for the better there, Mick.  Good thing you didn't have to witness anything that happened there.  So, well, I think she was kind of saying that things weren't working out well because  of some of maybe my hijinks in the jacuzzi.  Okay.  With one other girl and you were scuba diving for 40 minutes at a time.  Yeah.  Might have been an indicator.  That could have been a problem.  But, yeah, we spent a lot of time in the jacuzzi instead of walking around. 
[01:29:00]  And then I guess she got a little angry and took off that night and left the house, left  the party.  Well, I was still in a partying mood.  So, and, you know, who wants to be alone at a party?  So, a lovely young lady joined me upstairs and who knew that it's about 730 in the morning 
[01:29:30]  on my locked bedroom door, I'd hear a knocking and Anthony opened the door.  Uh, well, yeah.  So, um, I, I, uh, uh, quickly told, um, the girl that was with me that perhaps she should  get, uh, clothed.  Uh, so she went into my big walk-in closet and started to get clothed.  I opened the door and, uh, we started this discussion about, you know, what I was doing, why was  the door locked, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:30:00]  And, uh, so she was walking around the room and opening various doors and, oh, just like  let's make a deal, she, she hit the right door and there was, uh, the girl just standing  there kind of going high.  So she inquired as to how long, um, she had been f***ing my boyfriend.  So, um, uh, the girl was honest, told her, oh, about three weeks.  See, the girl should have said this is the first time.  Hey, well, you know, that's been a, uh, point of contention or that, but in the long run 
[01:30:30]  it didn't really matter.  Um, cause, uh, then, uh, uh, everyone left and then it was just me and Jill left in the  house to discuss things for a total of five minutes.  And then Jill left and took my Escalade, just drove off in it, leaving her car there and  taking my Escalade.  Now I didn't realize, but my keys were on the key ring and everything.  So I went to work the next day in another vehicle and she returned to the house, um, 
[01:31:00]  went inside, grabbed up this other girl's clothes in the closet, went out to my brand  new fire pit in the back, put it in all her clothes in the fire pit with some lighter fluid  and lit it up, lit up all this girl's clothes.  This is the most somber I've ever seen.  She's waiting to end up.  Yeah, yeah.  Not somber at all.  And not only were her clothes in there, but her birth certificate was there so she couldn't  get back into her own country.  All right, now, oh, okay.  I was, what, what?  I'm, I'm just jumping and making the radical assumption that this new girl was several 
[01:31:30]  years younger than Jill.  Oh, yeah.  She's several years younger than Dakota Fair.  Put it this way, it's, uh, it's illegal for her to drink in this country.  Look at the Similac.  Yeah, so, um, so that happened.  And then she also took, uh, uh, my easy pass, um, a computer that I think she thought was 
[01:32:00]  mine, but the computer wasn't working at the time.  I'll go into that a little more later.  Um, my pistol license, she took that, um, uh, a couple other things.  And then, and then she was saying, I'll give this back to you when you pick up my dry cleaning,  which is $500 and buy me a new camera that she lost at the party.  So it was kind of like, you know, a little hostage exchange.  Um, which finally I just was like, you know something, I, I just got to get this stuff 
[01:32:30]  back.  So, you know, I, I went for it and I, I do realize I kind of handled the situation, you  know, a little poorly, you know?  So I'm like, okay, I'll, I'll, I'll spring for the, the laundry and stuff.  So, uh, uh, give her that.  And then she, um, she goes, oh, so that's your laptop.  And I was like, yeah.  She goes, no, it isn't.  She goes, uh, uh, I had a computer forensic person go over the hard drive.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:33:00]  Not only that, then I was looking over some, uh, American express bills that were in the  pile of, of things that had to be filed and certain things were circled on them like restaurants  and hotels.  And, and then there was a little arrow and words.  That's her.  There you go.  She's a little arrow and words that said, um, uh, so were you out with one of your whores  on this night?  But you look so nice.  I'm looking at her on TV.  Tell them about the rabbit she cooked. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Well, we were all waiting for that, but no, there wasn't any, um, cooked rabbit or anything.  Oh, is this a good one?  No, turn it over.  I wrote it.  Oh, okay.  Just helping.  Oh, yes.  In the bag.  In the story.  Yeah.  In the bag.  That she burned.  That she burned where the girl's clothes, uh, her birth certificate, um, and, uh, her,  her grandfather had passed away.  Okay.  And they divvied up the ashes so that the, the various children and grandchildren could  take the ashes to maybe a special place. 
[01:34:00]  Yes.  And dispose of them.  Uh, that way the grandfather would be like all of my loved ones can then put them somewhere  special for their own place.  And I'll be in various happy places in my afterlife.  I assume this guy's, this guy now resides in my fire pit.  Yeah.  Now he's got ghosts.  Yes.  Thanks to you, Mick.  With, with, uh, uh, burnt cartons for beer and cigarette butts.  And, uh, yeah, that, um, and the wires from the bras.  Yeah.  And, and a lot of, uh, underwires. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Um, it just, uh, needless to say it ended a little, uh, iffy, you know, it was kind of  a little ugly, um, so sorry.  No, don't be it.  It, uh, made for a great radio.  It's going to make a fascinating book.  And once I got my stuff back and, uh, and our stuff back, I might've gone on the air and  said a few like nasty things.  Wow.  Um, I might've, well, you know, which I, I just, I won't want to get into. 
[01:35:00]  And I just said, I'm going to be a gay didn't unload as nastily.  And it all started because of you.  And that's why we're telling the story.  I have this feeling, uh, next time I, I run into Jill somewhere, I'm going to be like  a chief Brody when he gets smacked in the face by the grieving mom.  My son is dead.  I wanted you to know that.  Yeah.  It's like, Hey, what happened?  I was trying to close the beaches.  Make sure you wear a tie with little anchors on it. 
[01:35:30]  Look, my son was in that water too.  Just do what you do best.  Sign the paper.  Basically went and saying you own for about four sets of sheets.  So if you can leave the money when you, uh, leave the show today, that would be greatly  appreciated.  Well, next time somebody asks me to get involved in their personal, I'm just stepping off way  out of it.  Staying away.  I like the long haired Mick Foley.  He's back.  Yeah.  Your hair grows fast.  It does.  Damn.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's, I like the long hair.  The, the little crew cut was a little much. 
[01:36:00]  The crew cut was five years ago.  I was in here three months ago.  My hair was about exactly the same.  Really?  Yeah.  It kind of wasn't.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  I don't remember crap.  It's all right.  I'm talking about Mick Foley's promoting TNA, uh, uh, impact.  And you told the story on our show, which was awesome.  Cause we got like some nice, uh, national publicity.  All the wrestling sites went with our interview with you where, you know, you were telling,  uh, the behind the scenes stuff with Vince McMahon, yelling, yelling in your headset  as you're trying to like, uh, do the matches for him. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  You guys broke it because, uh, I was on strictly to sing happy birthday to Sam and I was kind  of, uh, you know, a profile, very low profile until we were allowed to talk about it.  And, uh, you got me when I had a lot of my mind and, uh, hadn't had anywhere else to  talk about.  Yeah.  Hey, Mick, how did you, um, how'd you escape the brain damage?  And I'll, I say this because we had Brett Michaels in here the other day or last week. 
[01:37:00]  It was depressing.  The guy is not the same person.  Really?  You're talking about the same, uh, what?  Oh, Brett Hart.  Oh my God.  What am I saying?  But Brett also, Brett Hart, you know, he had a, he had a stroke also and that, uh, caused  him to, to, uh, you know, just think a little, a little bit slower, but we've had the  Iron Cheek and we've had a super fly.  There's a whole list of these guys.  Let me tell you a quick, uh, there's a little difference though, between the damage I took  and some of their, some of the super flies damage was, uh, substance related, you know? 
[01:37:30]  Ah, yeah.  This is, uh, there weren't CBS, right?  I was never a big proponent of the F bomb anyway, but I'm going to tell you this, you  know, kind of PG, uh, super fly story that went, he left WWE at the height of his popularity  came to AWA wrestling and, uh, you know, it was a big, uh, catch for AWA, but they didn't  realize the super supply apparently had some baggage associated with them.  And, uh, so, uh, Greg Gagne runs over his dad and he goes, dad, I don't know what to  do with the guy.  And Vern says, what do you mean?  And he says, well, he's, you know, he's effed up. 
[01:38:00]  And so all of a sudden Snooker hears that.  He goes, you think the super fly is effed up?  You think the super fly is effed up?  Then the way the rock told the story to me, he says, super fly goes into a stall and you  hear like chopping sounds followed by like long, long snorting sounds like impossibly  long.  And he walks out of that stall and his eyes are like on fire and he goes, now the super  fly is effed up. 
[01:38:30]  Uh, but you know what?  I made a pretty good decision in, uh, you know, 2000, uh, that I kind of saw the future  and I thought, you know, if I stick around and do this full time, there's not going to  be much left of me in a year.  Uh, because as my knees and back were, uh, really acting up and I thought I had to give  the fans their money's worth, I was like, why don't I take damage to the skull?  You know, uh, give people their money's worth that way. 
[01:39:00]  I really liked seeing that cracked over the head 20 times at a chair.  So it was weird because you need to know what you don't know.  You understand?  And, uh, and I realized that about the third time I drove a half an hour past my house  that, uh, where am I?  But if you guys, if you guys get hurt, it's just bad choreography, right?  I mean, no, well, you know what?  It's, uh, especially when, uh, thing, when, uh, the ratings war and wrestling got really,  uh, tight, we had to give the fans more bang for their buck. 
[01:39:30]  And it was weird because when it was portrayed as being legit and real, you could actually  get away with more.  Uh, but once, once you start saying, Hey, this is, you know, we're, we're entertainment.  People start looking at it closer.  So on one hand, it was good for me because all of a sudden it was like, I get it.  This guy doesn't suck.  He's yeah.  Yeah.  He's really good at taking some real hits.  Yeah.  And, and, you know, and, and, and especially with, uh, VCRs, you know, guys could, uh, 
[01:40:00]  now, you know, obviously now it's DVDs, but guys could, uh, slow-mo and, you know, and  look at things and rewind them.  And I was the guy like, how, how do they do that?  Okay.  I see how they do that.  I was always intrigued when, when I couldn't find a loophole in somebody's style.  Yeah.  And I was like, I want to be the guy who doesn't have any loopholes.  So it seemed like a good idea when 19 years old, you know, I was like, that's a good idea.  Then as you get into your thirties, it's like, man, you would just legitimately throw yourself  from heights that are ridiculous. 
[01:40:30]  Just taking hits to the head that, I mean, you, I don't, how are you not knocked unconscious  every night?  Ah, man.  Some of those hits you did.  Yeah, yeah.  You had to be like, wow, that was a good one.  I am really like, I got the little birds flying around.  I had birds a lot of times.  I mean, I was just knocked out the one time, which was Hell in a Cell, but there were lots  of little birds, uh, over the years.  Lots.  And they started becoming more regular.  And at the time, it was kind of like this, you know, macho thing that you didn't want anyone 
[01:41:00]  to see, and you're bringing up your hand to block a shot.  You know, like as if seeing this steel object approaching your skull at high speeds, uh,  you know, it should not be deflected at all.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just the natural response to put your arm up.  And now when I see, you know, when I see guys, I hope they bring it up.  You know, I bring it up.  Did you, how do you avoid the steroids?  I assume you did for the most part.  Bret Hart was talking about how you guys were just lined up backstage.  There was a doctor that was just pretty much giving them whatever the hell they wanted. 
[01:41:30]  That was before my time.  I mean, a lot, I, I cleaned it up a bit when you came out.  I think it was putting steroids in donuts.  I went the other way.  Notice how I, notice how I just assumed there's no way you could have possibly ever been on steroids.  I just got to point you on the assumption, man.  Dude love did not look like you.  And, uh, you know what?  I mean, it was nice, uh, when everybody else was looking a certain way, it kind of opened  up the door for something that was entirely different. 
[01:42:00]  So, uh, I realized, you know, first of all, nature wasn't cooperating with me at all.  You know, the rumor was that I didn't work out.  And the truth was I worked out hard.  I just never had anything to show for it.  And, and I just, uh, you know, I mean, I thought about it was like 19 or 20 when I saw that's  what everybody was looking like.  And I just thought, you know, maybe I could go a little different direction, but I don't  know if you could ever offer up what I did in the ring as being the healthy alternative  to taking any kind of substance, you know? 
[01:42:30]  So, uh, and I understand that, you know, guys, uh, maybe felt like their jobs depended on  it and maybe, maybe they did, you know, back in another, uh, a few years ago, but it's  good now that you see guys of all different, uh, shapes and sizes and, you know, some of  the, like the rock hard chisel physiques aren't there anymore.  I don't think people care.  You know, we still look, uh, the guys for the most part still look better than the average,  uh, average guy out there.  We've seen, okay, I was, I was going to say, yeah, you, you had the kind of niche where 
[01:43:00]  you didn't have to be one of those guys, you know, you would, you would take such abuse  that it didn't matter if, you know, you had, uh, you know, triple H kind of a body or anything  like that.  It was just great to watch you get the crap beat out of you every night, you know, I'm  trying to think of how I can segue this to promoting the TNA show without it being so, uh,  well, yeah, that's true.  We're just, we're just delving into the past a little bit.  And then God forbid we'd like talk to you, make geez, can I just buy a commercial on 
[01:43:30]  our show and then scram last time I was here, I pointed out that when I, uh, introduced the,  uh, traveling virus, uh, that it was one of the darkest moments of my life.  I never realized how truly ugly your audience could be live.  And it was rich who pointed it out to everybody.  I was like, Oh man, that didn't work out too well.  And then rich comes on and he was like, yeah, I guess that mankind couldn't have spoke.  But what, I don't know how you put it, but it was like brutally true.  And I was just like wilting like that. 
[01:44:00]  What are you doing?  Good one, rich.  What's I mean?  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you, I'm sure you are.  You do.  Sometimes you gotta use it in those audiences.  And I said, I said to Opie and Anthony, like, all right, you know, man, that was a little  rougher because I'm used to almost everybody liking me.  And then that poor guy who was in here who won the crash comedy contest.  I mean, and he was good.  There was like 15 comedians there.  He was clearly the best.  Yeah.  He went out there and didn't stand a chance.  Yeah.  I mean, they just, they just hated him.  And I was like, wow, compared to that, my reaction was like a love in, you know, but 
[01:44:30]  that virus show, man, I mean, all the people we get for the show every summer.  Everyone's a heel.  Everyone's a heel in a virus show.  But this event always stands out in their minds as the event they did.  It can make people get applications in that thing.  It really is.  It's just terrible.  I wanted to give you a compliment based on what Ant was saying about all the crazy  stuff you did in the ring.  What I loved when you were wrestling was to see the announcers go out of character and 
[01:45:00]  basically go, holy ass, what is he doing tonight?  They weren't acting anymore and really pushing the action.  They just stepped out of that role and they were real human beings.  Like, this is insane.  Someone's got to stop him.  Yeah.  I mean, he's going to kill himself in the ring.  That famous cell match when JR made that call, good God, he's been broken in half.  It was like.  That wasn't a scripted line.  That was him just saying, what the hell is wrong with this guy?  The TNA impact Thursdays, 9 p.m. on Spike TV. 
[01:45:30]  Uh, oh, it's live this week.  It's live.  Yeah.  Live from Vegas and it's going high def.  So, uh, this is, I mean, it's a big deal.  I mean, you guys are kind of busting on me, uh, for, for leaving WWE.  Oh, you listen to the show.  I made a car.  I made an analogy here.  Okay.  Now, clearly you guys know that when, when someone goes out and publicly states that they  like your show better than Howard's, they know they're never going to be invited back  on Howard's show.  Right.  And there had to be frustrating for quite a while. 
[01:46:00]  You guys knew you had the better show and you couldn't crack through like the public  consciousness.  Right.  Right.  Same thing here.  We feel like we've got to be, yeah, not bad, right?  Sucking up to you guys in order to make my point.  Now we're on the same page.  All right.  I, you know, I had watched TNA, uh, since they went on Spike a couple of years ago.  And at first for several months, it's like, ah, there's no way this is going to work.  And then, uh, things started to, you know, I started to see a little more character development.  They were adding guys like Kurt Angle to the roster.  And more importantly, they weren't losing guys, you know, when their contracts came up. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  So I think there's a sign that, hey, not only are they getting guys, but when contracts  come up, even when WWE is making the better offers, guys are staying put because they  like the atmosphere.  Well, speaking of that, uh, TNA impact, just give us the roster of some of the guys that  people know out there that are now wrestling for TNA.  It'd be nice if I actually had the roster.  But you got Kurt Angle and Christian Cage and Booker T and Kevin Nash, who are all a  huge part of WWE.  And then you got guys like Samoa Joe, who I always, uh, felt an affinity for because he 
[01:47:00]  was a guy I really pushed for at WWE and they didn't think he had the physique for it.  So you got Joe and AJ Styles.  You got all these guys making up the X division who do these, uh, wild, amazing things.  Isn't Sting part of that too?  Sting is part of it.  Yeah.  Sting was a guy, uh, you know, who was my first real mainstream opponent in the early  nineties and he's back there and, uh, you kind of see guys who really are enjoying themselves  because they're not on the road, you know, 25 days a month, uh, traveling, uh, through  different time zones.  And it's, uh, for me, it's honestly, and you can look at me, Anthony and no Norton, you 
[01:47:30]  can look at me, you know, I'm telling the truth here.  This is the most fun I've had since like 19, uh, you know, since 1999, 2000, when I got  to do a lot of stuff on my own, you know, the WWE show has been so tightly controlled in  the last few years that it's really wasn't fun when I was there.  Aren't you guys doing something on ice around Christmas?  And for the record, Nick looks very unhappy and sad when he said that. 
[01:48:00]  I don't know why he comes back.  It's very depressed.  But TNA is on, uh, I mean, you got Thursdays at nine o'clock.  Yeah.  You got Booker T too.  And someone I used to love, uh, I forgot all about, but he's, uh, on TNA is Jeff Jarrett.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeff's, uh, yeah.  Jeff's one of the founders.  He's hilarious.  He's good.  And, uh, yeah, I mean, he was instrumental in bringing me in there and, uh, I'm just,  uh, I'm, I'm really thrilled to be there.  Cool.  Uh, where are your kids with you these days?  That's my favorite thing with you.  Like, cause we've been talking to Mick Foley for God, close to 10 years now. 
[01:48:30]  And they were very little when you first started coming on the show.  And this was dad can't do no wrong.  Got the posters and they've, all they want to do is watch their dad wrestle.  And now they can't be bothered.  No, they're getting into that teenage, that those teenage years where it's like, yeah,  dad, whatever.  Well, now I've got the, you know, the older kid, the, the, the defining moment, like you  said, they had the posters and everything.  And one day back when we were living in Florida, I open up the room, you know, like looking at  it.  I was like, geez, something's different about this room.  It takes me about 10 minutes.  And all of a sudden I run back there, open up the door. 
[01:49:00]  I'm like, he took the posters down.  Like no dad.  You know, there's always like a symbolic moment when a dad slips down the totem pole, but  to actually be replaced by like Sammy Sosa, you know, it's kind of heartbreaking.  But that's where I'm getting at.  I'm not, I'm not really, I'm not taking a shot at you.  Right.  I'm doing, you know, it seems like every parent goes through that with their kids where you  can't do no wrong.  And then there's a, there's a defining moment where now they're like, get away from me,  dad, for a few years.  But you know what, they, um, uh, they were at the, uh, Nassau Coliseum, uh, during the 
[01:49:30]  Great American Bash.  And that's when it's clear that things weren't working out with me and Vince.  And I did go out of my way to avoid him that day.  And if it hadn't been for Mickey, my seven-year-old room, I'm going to tell you a little story  last night where I, dad definitely did do wrong last night as far as little Mickey was concerned,  but he wanted a bowl of cereal before we left.  So as the little guys were eating the bowl of cereal, Vince came out of the office and he said,  listen, I know you've got problems with me.  And we had a very intense and not exactly cordial, but it was never got, you know, never 
[01:50:00]  got loud, but it was a pretty intense conversation for like 20 minutes.  I think the fact that my kids saw me, my older kids saw me like standing, you know, toe to  toe with a, you know, this larger in life billionaire and not giving ground made them, they understood  you could like earn respect in a quiet, understated way.  That's great.  That's, that's such a shame.  You did so much for Vince in that organization.  But you know what, it was, it was a great, it really was great.  Most of the time was great.  But I mean, you know, Vince, I think part of the reason that, I don't know if he wants, 
[01:50:30]  he was, I got the feeling he was a big Bush guy.  And I think he liked that, that idea that I'm the decider, you know, making these decisions.  And I would, I would sit in these, these production meetings and I would see Vince make split  second decisions that, you know, you know, you know, would either, you know, you make  somebody's career or almost end it.  And then I would have to walk out and I'd see some poor guy like, Hey, how you doing  Mick?  I'm like, I'm doing good. 
[01:51:00]  Dead man walking.  But in my case, I went out there last year and I gave a, it was almost like my traveling  virus moment in WWE, like wrong promo and the wrong crowd.  They've been sitting there a long, long time.  And I don't have proof that was the moment, but I know that I was pulled from the roster  when I was supposed to have like this great storyline starting one week or three weeks  after my book came out, the, the hardcore diaries.  And instead I got sat down the day after mania and said, Mick, uh, we're going to have 
[01:51:30]  to repackage you.  You know, you're not connecting with the fans anymore.  Oh, so my editor calls me up and she said, I thought you're going to be on TV.  And I said, you know, you know, they said they have to repackage me.  I'm not connecting with the fans.  And her statement was not connecting with the fans.  You're number six on the New York times bestseller list.  Like only, you know, it's like this alternate universe where facts don't seem to matter.  It's all about split sessions, split second decision making. 
[01:52:00]  Some tells me the audience is probably different, uh, readers.  And, uh, you're saying I was appealing to that percentage of people who are reading.  Probably weren't there that night.  They were home reading your book.  Yeah, that's sorry.  But it was.  I mean, you guys are trying to get me to say something bad about Vince on the phone last  time.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  You're trying to.  And honestly, you know, I told you that part of the reason I got out when I did was so  that I could sit back and kind of laugh about it because if I had re-signed, I mean, I'd 
[01:52:30]  be miserable right now.  I'd just be.  It wouldn't matter how often.  It wouldn't matter if it was twice a year that he really got in my ear.  I'd be waiting on it.  You know, I'd be like that poor abused wife.  The anticipation of the next punch in the eye.  Yeah.  And you never knew when I was doing that.  You do the good low Vince voice.  Doesn't he?  He's got that one down.  Yeah.  Not the yelling Vince.  Yeah.  Got a problem.  Really a good low volume Vince.  But you seem very happy, Mick.  Oh, man.  Things are going well with this TNA impact. 
[01:53:00]  Thursday's 9 p.m. on Spike.  It's going live this week, too, which is cool.  It is for the first time.  You want to hang for the rest of the show or what?  Cheech and Chong are coming in, right?  Yeah.  You can hang with us and, you know.  I think I've got to do some interviews.  Oh, stop.  I'll hang for a little while just so I can be around those guys.  Yeah.  It would be smart for you to hang because if you leave, then we're going to talk to you.  We're going to talk bad about you as soon as you leave.  Oh, I don't want that to happen.  All right.  No, I don't want that to happen.  Jesus, Opie, could you just, like, shut up?  I think we're confusing the listeners.  We actually adore this guy, but that's why we take our little shots because we feel like 
[01:53:30]  you're one of the guys, Mick.  Can I just tell you a quick story about the seven-year-old yesterday?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, uh...  Is there another serial story?  No, no, no.  This is the...  I'm going to hide this from my wife forever, but share it with your audience.  We were up in a wedding in the White Mountains in New Hampshire.  It was like an eight-hour ride, so I planned out this way of cutting the ride in half by  stopping at Six Flags New England.  We had someone there helping us out a little bit. 
[01:54:00]  And Mickey, he starts getting agitated.  Like, this is boring.  This is boring.  You know, meanwhile, he's been on a couple cool rides.  And so I say, all right, well, the last ride we do is Superman.  Superman's rated the top steel roller coaster in the world.  And I get on with my daughter, and it's embarrassing because they're letting me get to the front  of the line.  There's nothing like that feeling of realizing, you guys wouldn't know this feeling, you don't  fit.  Now that you've cut the line, and you get in, and you don't fit into the coaster.  And I see little Mickey, and I said, do you want to go? 
[01:54:30]  Oh, no.  And he just made the height limit.  You know, he's tall for his age.  And I'll tell you, there was polar opposites between the way he looked when he embarked  on that ride and the way he looked when he finished that ride.  And as he was, like, going up that 210-foot hill, I'm like, this was probably not a good  idea.  And the poor little guy came back.  He was like the guy in planes, trains, and automobiles that John Candy spoke about where 
[01:55:00]  he put his kid in the funeral, left his kid in the funeral home for, you know, kids are  resilient.  They'll snap out of it.  He just had those eyes.  Was he terrified?  He didn't complain about being bored the rest of the way home.  But, you know, we waited and we got that photo.  I wish I had the photo.  Just sheer terror.  Nice.  Well, listen, we got to take a break.  We got Cheese and Chong, and they're here, and they got to be out by nine, so we really 
[01:55:30]  should.  Right, right.  But stick around, Megan.  I will.  I will.  Yeah, I sure will.  We want to play the Superfly Snooker ID did for us going on a break.  We want to, like, rip this thing apart, but I don't know if we have time.  We'll at least play it for everybody.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you are listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[01:56:00]  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio dog.  Yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, and safe to say that we're all very, very  excited.  No offense, Mick, but these guys, you know, I grew up listening to their CDs.  They're some of the first Tommies.  I mean, ahead of their time.  I'm trying to make believe I'm, you know, younger than I am.  I mean, the albums and the cassettes. 
[01:56:30]  I couldn't imagine the big bamboo paper and a CD.  That'd be a little odd.  Folded.  A little small.  Yeah, a little small.  Just regular-sized paper.  It's Cheech and Chong, everyone.  Hello.  Hey, buddy.  Please sit down.  Welcome to the show.  No offense taken, because honestly, you guys asked me to stay, and I thought if I crossed  paths with Cheech and Chong, and they found out that I could have stayed and opted not  to, that it would be a sign of gross disrespect. 
[01:57:00]  You'd have to send guys after you, man.  Your kids would take our poster down, too.  I like the fact that Mick acted like we asked him to stay, and he goes, can I stay when they  need me?  Phony.  And I got to say, Tommy Chong did our show.  A few years ago, and we loved you.  We wanted to try to get you to do it on a semi-regular basis.  We'd stop by and say hi every once in a while, but we haven't seen you since.  Well, this is semi-regular.  He was in jail.  Yeah.  That's about that stint.  Yeah, that'll put a crimp in your social calendar. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  How are you guys getting along?  Everything's good?  Back together?  You guys are happy?  He's a jerk, but it's okay.  I love him.  That must have sucked being in jail, looking at the TV, and there's Cheech working.  You know?  Like, God damn it.  No, no.  One of the biggest laughs I got was when I found out Cheech was a love interest for,  what was her name?  Tyne Daly.  Tyne Daly.  Oh, damn.  I still laugh at that.  When the hell was that?  Is that recent?  Must have been hilarious. 
[01:58:00]  In jail.  Good point.  Who are you a love interest for?  Actually, he looked quite a bit like Tyne Daly.  Better.  Jesus.  No, but I know Cheech just tastes in ladies, you know.  In Tyne Daly.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, he's a gardener, and he's a love interest with Tyne Daly.  Oh, damn.  What was the name of the show?  Judgey Namy.  Judgey Namy.  Of course.  That was fun.  She was great to work with, man. 
[01:58:30]  Tyne Daly?  Yeah.  She was a real pro, you know.  Really, really good actress.  Did she take her teeth out?  I put them in backwards.  God damn, I remember she was in like a Dirty Harry or something.  I saw that the other day, man.  It was a young Tyne Daly.  Damn, she's young, and it still ain't working for me.  But she's working with all the sexy goddesses, you know.  Betty White.  Betty White.  Betty White.  Betty White was the first person I ever saw on TV when I was a kid. 
[01:59:00]  She was on a local L.A. dance party thing called Make Believe Ballroom with Al Jarvis,  and she was 19 years old.  Wow.  And had the hugest rack.  Really?  Yeah, at 19.  She just graduated from Beverly Hills High, and she was this like bubbly little Betty White.  She's a dirty woman.  She's like filthy.  She has anything about sex.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she's got a great sense of humor.  Worse than Cloris Leachman?  You guys have been watching Cloris.  Yeah, yeah.  She's crazy, too, yeah.  Cloris, she's a female, but you don't want to look. 
[01:59:30]  She shows you her teeth, you go, okay.  Yeah, I can put those away.  Yeah, put them away.  How old is she?  She's showing off her 82-year-old cleavage on that show.  Just fold them up and put them away.  No, actually, they're real, too.  Really?  She was sexy on Mary Tyler Moore, though.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Cloris was kind of a whorey character.  Yeah.  Remember the movie, The Last Picture Show?  I didn't see it.  Yeah.  It was Bo Bridges. 
[02:00:00]  Ooh, she was hot, man.  She was the other woman.  Cloris Leachman was.  Yeah, she was the other woman.  She was in Miss America at one time.  She has such a sexy last name.  Leachman.  This is awful.  Leachman.  It's not that Cloris is knocking down the doors.  It was a nickname.  Not going to hear that name in a strip club anytime soon.  Ladies and gentlemen, making our way to the stage, it's Cloris Leachman.  Give her a big hand.  Girls, girls, girls.  It's only a stage if your real name is Hepatitis.  So now you guys back together, right, on the road, taking it on the road. 
[02:00:30]  And are you doing new stuff, or are you going out with the classic interior?  We're like the Alzheimer's show.  Our show is brand new to us.  We haven't done it for, what, 30 years.  30 years, yeah.  Wow, damn.  It was like we'd never left.  I mean, it was like we'd been off for 30 minutes.  Really?  Yeah, we never even rehearsed going back. 
[02:01:00]  We just kind of talked over one bit, and then went on stage, and it was like, oh, man.  We actually sat.  I got a couple of chairs in my backyard.  We put the chairs together.  We sat next to each other and looked at each other and said, oh, okay, let's do it.  Yeah, we're back here.  How do we do this again?  We're good to go.  You know, because we were improv comedians, so it was like, well, whatever he says, answer that.  Yeah.  It would be like you guys rehearsing.  Yeah, we don't rehearse.  You're right.  You know, you don't.  You show up.  We should prepare.  We don't do that either. 
[02:01:30]  No, we don't.  We never did.  Are you guys doing clubs or theaters?  Theaters.  We're going to be in the Westbury Music Fair.  Funny you should have.  Westbury Music Fair Thursday and Friday.  Yep.  This week?  Yeah.  This week.  Oh, nice.  And we're going to be in the Radio City Music Hall in January.  Damn.  So come and see us there.  And we're selling out everywhere.  Of course, man.  Yeah, you've got to go to CheechandChung.com, see where they're playing, and get a ticket  immediately.  Yeah.  People have been waiting for this one for a long time.  It's amazing.  I mean, in bad economic times, we're doing really well. 
[02:02:00]  We haven't been on stage in 30 years, and we don't have a record or a movie, a TV show,  nothing.  But we've got a history.  We've got a history.  That's what's going on.  And I've got a record.  Yeah.  Well, it's a different kind, but it's not a record.  Here's how I've got a record.  And what kind of audiences are they?  You know, the amazing thing is the majority of the audience, 80% of the audience is between  30 and 40.  Wow.  And they're all, like, they're crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've got to tell you, I try to do some political humor in Detroit. 
[02:02:30]  I got booed.  Yes.  I didn't want to hear any.  I didn't want to hear anything.  They didn't want to hear any political stuff.  And they're, like, half and half, half McCain, half Obama.  Yeah.  And we had McCain supporters there.  That's how crazy and retarded our audience is.  Oh, yeah.  What are they showing up for us?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they're Chief of John fans, but, you know, they're just nuts.  You would think they'd all be Obama guys, right?  Well, you would think, you know, but no, no, no.  We were saying in the day that we were middle-of-the-road dopers.  Yeah.  And that that was the norm.  And it's true. 
[02:03:00]  That's what we were.  So, you know, I mean, all of a sudden we'd be on stage, and you could see a change  from the city.  All of a sudden we'd get to Detroit and Indianapolis, and we'd say, yeah, Obama, boo.  What?  What are you doing here?  You've got to be enjoying the hell out of this election, though.  This is a weird one.  Oh, I love it.  I love the whole, I love McCain.  He's such a retard.  Whatever Obama says, you know, whatever they do wrong, McCain blames Obama for it. 
[02:03:30]  You know, it's your fault that the economy's in the mess, you know, because you palled around  with a terrorist.  Yeah.  He's just barely restraining himself, you can see.  Oh, yeah.  McCain, yeah.  Who wants to say the N-word so bad?  He got as hard as that one, but we know what he meant.  We said it behind closed doors.  You've got to think that word is a fly-in.  Oh, can you imagine?  It's got to be.  McCain, McCain campaign headquarters, when the door shuts.  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be a great one.  What about after they sweep for bugs? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Just yell it as loud as they can.  What about Sarah Palin?  Oh, I'd love to hear that conversation.  Yes.  About the Republican Party talking about, who picked her?  Whose idea was that?  Yeah, because she drives the crowd, but, you know, so do strippers.  Yeah.  Tina Fey did such a great impression.  Oh, yeah.  We just cracked her white open.  You know when then Obama and we got a little, yeah.  She has made her a caricature, right?  It's like you don't even take Sarah Palin seriously because of Tina Fey. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Boy, how can you take her seriously?  I mean, what?  Well, she's really smart.  I mean, run in Alaska?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It really takes her brain to run.  Have you been to Alaska?  I hate Alaska.  I've never been there.  I've been there, of course.  You know, like the sun doesn't go down in the summertime.  Yeah.  So you've got people walking around that should be in bed, you know, and they're carrying guns.  Sarah Palin, five kids.  Yeah, they're carrying guns, you know, and they've got that look in their eye, you know.  And when they mine for gold, they take a hose, a pressure hose, and they just destroy a hillside. 
[02:05:00]  You know, that's called mining for gold.  That's how they mine for gold.  And it's weird.  I hung with some of the police up there, and they're Native American, you know, Native American police.  In other words, the guy's sober.  That's why he got the job.  And they're nuts.  They're crazy.  And she's the mayor, or no, the governor of the fine state.  Were you hanging with the police of your own choice? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, criminals and police get along really well.  Yeah.  My dad was a policeman.  Really?  Yeah, LAPD, 30 years.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you still selling merch after shows now?  Like, what do you do?  Oh, so big time.  Oh, so big time.  So we were big in the...  We never had our merchandising together ever before, you know.  No.  And now we have it together.  Boy, we're selling a ton of money.  Which you probably kicked yourself in the ass for not, like years ago.  Yeah, not really.  No.  We were never in it for the money act, you know.  We were in it for the drugs, basically. 
[02:06:00]  Just for the drugs.  You made the money.  That's what it was going to get spent on anyway, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, you know, your wife gets it anyway, you know.  We get it.  So much.  But you know what I am selling?  We are selling...  Like, I got a couple of things, you know.  A.K.A. Tommy Chong.  It's a documentary about my time in jail.  And so we're selling that at the gig, you know, on a CD.  How were you able to...  Oh, any video or...  Oh, it's a video.  Like surveillance? 
[02:06:30]  What did it have?  Yeah, it's got all that.  Yeah, it has.  They got video of the U.S.  The government had to give me the evidence, you know, that they had on me.  Oh, wow.  And so we made a...  Jail after hours.  Yeah.  Yeah, we made a video of it.  Oh, wow.  And it's a great video.  Chong gone wild.  Yeah, it's Chong.  But they didn't show the one where the undercover cop talks to me.  And he says...  You know, he's one of these really undercover cops.  He's got a headband.  You know, no one wears headbands anymore.  Yeah, it's just like over-the-top undercover guy. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, undercover cop.  Yeah, and he had a backpack with a camera in it.  And he'd lean...  Every time he'd ask me a question, he'd kind of lean his backpack, you know, so I'd get  his answer.  Oh, there you go.  And he asked me, he said, these pipes are yours.  They're not really for smoking tobacco, are they?  I said, no, they're for pot.  And then he went out the truck and went, shoot the moon!  That's probably what it is.  But check out the DVD, aka TommyChomp.com.  Were you in a G-pop, that's the general population, or like, I'm over 50, and someone said when  you go to jail or prison, they put you with people over 50, like you don't go amongst 
[02:07:30]  the youth?  No, no.  Well, I was in a camp, like Martha Stewart, same kind of camp.  Yeah.  Camp Cupcake.  Like Camp No-Am or something?  Yeah, it's a...  The jail was actually designed and built for Republicans.  Yeah.  During the Watergate scandal, when they had to put all these guys in jail, they had no  place to, you know, to put themselves in a real place.  So they built...  They only have nine holes in the golf club. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, damn.  No, they don't have golf, but they have tennis.  They have tennis, they have a running track, they have a soccer field, they had a...  A football field, two baseball diamonds, I mean, sports all day, a garden.  I used to go work in the garden, that was my job.  Yeah.  I bet.  That was it.  I bet.  Cheech goes, I bet, yeah.  Hey, we got Lost fans checking in.  Yeah.  Cheech.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not...  I've never seen Lost, I'm one of the...  You're Lost?  But Ant's a huge fan of Lost.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It's a great program.  I mean, I just did an episode right before we started with a tour, it'll be on sometime. 
[02:08:30]  The fun part about it is you sit in the makeup trailer and you talk to the other actors about  their character.  So why are you here?  How come you're still filming and you died two weeks ago?  Yeah.  And hearing their stories and they don't even know what they are, it's amazing.  Yeah, because you never know.  Because with the flashbacks and the flash forwards, you don't know.  Well, if somebody's dead on the show and they turn up again.  I play Hurley's father and I think he's going to be behind the whole thing at the end.  Yeah, really? 
[02:09:00]  You think it's going to all be...  He's the mastermind, yeah.  He's the mastermind.  The writers have got to be brilliant to tie this all in.  I mean, after the last season, they've got to tie in like 15 different stories.  They probably don't even know where they're going.  That is the greatest control for actors ever invented.  15 characters.  Yeah.  You know, yeah, he died.  Tell them what you have to wear, a wig, right?  Oh, yeah, I got this wig that looked like a Tony, the emcee of Ernie's on the strip.  Hey, I'm winning your party.  What a boof. 
[02:09:30]  What's it feel like?  Oh, it's a little like I have a raccoon on my head.  You know, like it's hot and it's in Hawaii.  You have to go to Hawaii.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just like sweating all day, all day, all day.  One of the best characters I've ever seen you play was Dusk Till Dawn.  That was hysterical.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, not the Border Patrol.  Although the Border Patrol, you were good.  What's going on in there?  Like you put on some kind of a hick accent.  But then, no, the guy at the door.  Oh, yeah.  You know what it is? 
[02:10:00]  He actually had a name that I never found out till then.  Really?  Yeah, his name was Chet Pussy.  Really?  I don't know why, but there he was.  Yeah, wow.  Who knows why?  His name was Chet.  Chet.  You come in and just get popped in the face.  Fantastic.  It's really fun working with Robert Rodriguez.  I bet.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a really fun guy.  Is that your wig right there?  That's it?  Oh, my God.  We've got to get that up on our website.  That is horrific.  Oh, my God.  Hey, how many in your party?  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, guys.  Give him a boof.  Maury's wigs don't come off.  That's hot.  That thing is hot, too.  I can't wait to get it off.  Yeah, when I was on the 70s show, I had to wear a wig, too.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  I had the long hair.  When they had the wrap party, the final episode, I was so glad to get rid of that.  Oh, God.  Have you guys done any TV to promote, too?  I know you've done some radio.  Are you guys doing any of the major shows?  Are they filming any of this stuff?  Uh, so far, no.  How?  No?  On the girl show.  A couple of talk shows that are going to show. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, Chelsea Handler, we did.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  We were on Chelsea.  Yeah.  You don't get yelled at sometimes?  You know, the glorification of drugs that was here.  Oh, we get that.  No.  Shut up.  I'm like a designated go-to doper guy.  Yeah.  Or MSNBC.  Yeah.  And I was on a couple of times with Contessa Brewer.  Is that her name?  Yeah.  She's like it.  It's a nice chick, but, you know, doesn't know too much.  She said, do you still, are you high right now?  Do you smoke? 
[02:11:30]  Are you high right now?  Do you smoke?  Uh, I said, I'm not into pot anymore.  I'm smoking hemp.  And she goes, oh, well, that's, oh, well, that's different.  I said, oh, yeah.  We don't smoke anymore.  We're too old.  We're into suppositories.  Yeah.  We're fun.  So you guys should be filming this whole tour.  I hope you are.  You should be filming the shows and filming the behind-the-scenes stuff.  We're going to have a DVD.  We started out filming it.  We started out filming it.  Then it was like, we were looking at a reality show and all that. 
[02:12:00]  Then we looked at it and, ah.  Too much work.  Are people taking bets?  Because, like, Van Halen, the tour was great.  Everybody thought there was going to be a meltdown.  Are people thinking you guys are going to make it?  I don't think so at this point.  Because we're getting along fine.  We're having fun downstairs.  We do stoner humor.  Yeah.  I mean, how, you know, our whole career is a joke.  You know what I mean?  I mean, the fact that we did what we did, we look at each other and go, wow.  You know, we got away with it.  After a few years, though, I mean, how many years have gone by? 
[02:12:30]  And, like, some of the, I guess, maybe there was some petty stuff that kind of got between  you guys that you look at now and just go, oh, what a bunch of crap that was.  Yeah, probably, yeah.  Like, to be mad at that or something.  Exactly.  We forgot what we were arguing about, you know?  Yeah.  Well, it was really stupid arguments, you know.  I don't doubt it.  Both of you is high.  Yeah.  Can't carry on a conversation high.  Like, what were we just talking about?  But, you know, the way it worked, it was, he would suggest something and I'd go, ah, no, 
[02:13:00]  that'll never work, and then 10 years later, I'd suggest the same thing, and he'd go, ah,  that'll never work.  But it all worked out great because it came at a time in our career where, see, when we  wanted to get together before, he was always doing something or I was doing something, and  then it just came at the right time where even though I was doing something, it would  be better if, you know, I was on the road with my wife, but it'd be better if we teamed  up with Cheech, and like Cheech put it, you know, we each have a half of the treasure 
[02:13:30]  map.  Right.  It only works when they're together.  Yeah, and access the treasure without both halves.  Right.  I mean, it's bigger than the sum of its parts.  Mm-hmm.  So, and it's amazing to see the reaction of the audience when we go out there.  It was like, ah, you know, they never thought they'd see us.  How is that, like, what do you think, where do you think that comes from, that you have  such longevity in the business like that when other people, like, you ain't gonna see, like,  the Smothers Brothers go out there.  Well, they were the only one that did what they did. 
[02:14:00]  Well, there's a time.  I'm asking them, Rich.  Yeah, stop embarrassing everybody.  There's a time in your career.  Sit down.  Cheech, Chong, and Voss.  Great.  Right.  No, what happened to Cheech?  Pulls off the tongue, doesn't it?  Cheech and Chong, we were always true to what we did.  We always were true.  There was a time when we could have sold out.  But, you know, when we, there was, actually, we got offered a television show called Chico  and the Man.  It didn't end up being Chico and the Man.  And we got offered everything.  They wanted, they said, you can have, except they didn't offer ownership of the show. 
[02:14:30]  But they offered a lot of money and everything else.  And this is before we did the movies.  And so we looked, and we don't want to be on television.  Because we knew right away they were gonna, they would take what we had and, you know,  and homogenize it.  And we'd be like Freddie Prinze blowing our brains out.  Yeah.  After a series or two.  And so we, we, we turned that down.  So we were always true to our own stuff, you know.  And we were never offered movies.  At least we were never offered movies at the right time.  You know, we got offered stripes when we were halfway through next movie. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  So, so, uh, everything we did was pure Cheech and Chong.  And even the breakup was pure Cheech and Chong.  And, and so when we get back together.  Because there was nobody else involved.  Yeah.  In the breakup of Cheech and Chong.  Yeah.  Just Cheech and Chong.  And false.  That's part of the problem is that you guys seem to end too soon.  And that's why I probably, you're selling out everywhere.  Because it was like, it was, it seemed like there was a lot of unfinished business.  That's right.  It was frustrating to fans.  Like, God damn it.  Mm-hmm.  And it didn't fade out and start.  It's amazing the way that the, it kept on. 
[02:15:30]  Because seeing the movies was a rite of passage for teenage kids.  Oh, my God.  For generations.  Hell, yeah.  Every time you got to be 14, 15, 16, boom, Cheech and Chong movies.  And they kept handing it on.  And then they would go access the records, you know.  And it was, I was amazed that, that generations would come up and say their favorite bit.  And I go, well, I didn't even remember them, you know.  Yeah.  Is that a movie or an album?  And Cheech kind of serviced the straighter part of the audience, you know, with the TV shows lost and everything else. 
[02:16:00]  And he masked an incredible audience.  I stayed in the sort of the rapper kind of doper sort of side.  And so when we get together now, we get both of them.  Yeah.  We get both.  We get the straight audience.  We get the rapper audience, that type of audience.  And it just is magic.  And it's just like the magic between us.  The greater percentage of our audience that's seen us now in concert weren't born the last time we were on stage.  Wow.  80% of the audience is between 30 and 40.  Wow. 
[02:16:30]  Was it 30 years since the last time you guys performed together before this?  27, actually.  But probably 30 because the 27 came at the end of the movie.  We have people going to me, my grandmother went out with you.  My grandmother said she did both of you.  Oh, dude, what a question.  Did you guys in the past, of course, did you ever pull, you know, the two of you on the same girl at one point in your life?  We weren't into girls then.  Oh.  That came later.  Older women.  We were into. 
[02:17:00]  What year was Up and Smoke?  78.  That was 78.  $100 million it made.  $100 million.  It was the very first gold videocassette.  The very first one.  Wow.  And nominated for four Grammys.  It's like, you guys got like a lot of real respect.  We got a Grammy, too.  Yeah.  I got mine.  You still got yours?  Oh, it always says nominated.  No, we were nominated for every record we made, but we won it once.  Where's your Grammy, Tommy?  I don't know.  I figured it was. 
[02:17:30]  She's in a home.  Made up of high.  I got gold records.  I don't know.  There's stuff somewhere.  I got one of your gold records.  You do?  Yeah.  It's for Tommy Chong to commemorate.  I got it.  Just put it up there.  George Lopez once found one in a store, you know, and he bought it to give to me, and  I told him, George, it's counterfeit.  He got ripped off.  He's trying to do a good deed like, man, this is your stuff.  Yeah.  You should have this. 
[02:18:00]  No, I shouldn't.  I felt like O.J., you know.  I think he's going to get, what do you think his sentence is going to be?  O.J. is going away forever, man.  His only defense is that, hey, they're trying to pin that murder I did on me.  That ain't fair.  I only burglarized a guy.  I didn't kill.  They can't pin that on me.  Even though I wrote a book.  What do you think they are?  Don't they know who I am?  This is how I did it.  Did you guys ever see us live? 
[02:18:30]  Mm-mm.  Never.  Never.  Did you see it there?  No.  Just the old albums and the movies.  And I saw you.  They did a biography on you on some channel.  I don't even remember what it was, but they had the whole thing of how you got together  and everything.  And then they showed clips of you guys on stage.  And it was pretty cool.  We're having fun on stage.  I mean, you know, people ask me why we got back together.  I just wanted to see if we could still do it, you know, after all these, because it's  a pretty physical act.  I mean, we run around and dance.  And you're sniffing each other's butts, you know. 
[02:19:00]  That's the physical part.  Well, whenever Cheech came to me, or, you know, his manager that came to me and said,  you know, we've got to put the act together, I looked at Cheech and said, are you going  to put on the tutu?  And he wouldn't say yes or no.  He'd just look at me.  And I said, you know, and that was the thing.  If he put on the tutu, that meant we were back together.  And the day he put on that tutu, we had to get a bigger size.  A stretch of a tutu.  He put on the tutu, and he came running out. 
[02:19:30]  We had a little rehearsal hall going.  We were going over the music, and he came running out with his tutu on.  I said, we're back.  Cheech, is it scarier for you because, like, you know, Tommy, you stayed on stage for a  lot of the time, and you concentrated on the film.  Was it harder for you, do you think, to get back on stage in front of the live audiences?  Not at all.  No.  I mean, not at all.  It was scary, only that the first time we got on stage, I said, oh, jeez, I know this  stuff so well.  It's part of my DNA.  I mean, it's like, this is really a part of me.  I can't get rid of it.  You know, it's so natural. 
[02:20:00]  We never rehearsed.  When we went back on stage, we never rehearsed.  We just went over, talked over a couple of the bits, and went on stage, and did the bits  like we'd been off a week.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  I got to go.  But Westbury, I didn't know you were actually at Westbury.  It's this Thursday and this Friday, and they're doing the coming October 25th, the Orpheum  in Minneapolis, and what's the website?  So we give out the website.  Cheechanchang.com.  Cheechanchang.com.  I know you guys have Atlantic City coming up, too, which is a big market for us. 
[02:20:30]  What's that in January?  Yeah.  Go to LiveNation.com.  LiveNation.com, even better.  For the Cheechanchang.  Radio City.  I mean, you guys are going to sell it everywhere.  Actually, I want to go Thursday night.  I had no idea you guys were local.  I think we're going to have to do that.  We were just in Vegas last night.  It was great.  We did two shows at the Palms and the Pearl.  We're just adding extra shows every year.  Wait, literally last night you took a red eye?  No, excuse me, Saturday.  Oh, okay.  So we came in yesterday, yeah.  Have you guys done that? 
[02:21:00]  I forgot what day it is.  Have you done the Virginia Beach Funny Bone yet?  Oh, Red Cross.  I'm sexual on that this weekend.  It's the equivalent of an outhouse with a microphone.  Are you there?  Yeah, I've been there.  I've done that Funny Bone before.  Sometimes I travel with my wife, too.  She's a comic.  Do you ever get in big fights with her over shows?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, because basically, I'm just saying, you're there to see you, and then she's going  on first.  But you don't want to say that.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:21:30]  I learned that.  You never want to say that.  No, but his wife opens up for us on the show.  She's great.  It's amazing.  Okay, similar, Tommy.  I'll use an example.  Did your wife ever catch you in a rest area with another guy?  Of course.  That's what he really wanted to get to.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, my wife's very cool.  She knocks very loud before she walks into any situation.  Well, the great Cheech and Cha-  Yeah, we've got to get out of here, unfortunately.  Okay, man.  They're ending our show. 
[02:22:00]  Okay.  But LiveNation.com, and this Thursday, Friday, Westbury Music Fair here in New York.  If there's tickets available, go to Live Nation.  And Radio City Music Hall, January 31st.  I don't know if those tickets are on sale yet.  Are they?  I don't know.  I think they are.  They must be.  Check out aka TommyChung.com for the video.  And Mick Foley, Mick Foley, you stuck around.  You didn't ask a question or nothing.  I was starstruck or something.  What's going on?  I was starstruck.  And you guys were asking such good, penetrating questions. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Can I ask a quick question?  Sure.  Tommy, I just want to know-  Yeah, we'll just stay here.  You know, I grew up seeing you in the different movies, doing comedy, and all of a sudden you're  an accepted, I know it wasn't sudden, but you're an accepted dramatic actor, and just  wondering what the first dramatic role was, and if that was a stretch at the time to try  it.  I did a cop in a Showtime movie with somebody, and then people were in it. 
[02:23:00]  That's all I remember about it.  And I go, well, I could do this.  This is actually much easier than doing comedy.  Yeah.  You know, comedy is like playing the slot machines, only every time you put a coin in, you have  to get coins back.  Yeah.  And drama is accumulative.  You know, you get the reaction like at the end.  But comedy, you got to get coins back every time you put it, or else you ain't doing it.  In a dramatic scene, right, you don't walk out of the scene and people go, I didn't cry 
[02:23:30]  or feel emotion, they're just, that's the end of the scene, and that's okay.  Yeah, it accumulates through the piece, and comedy is immediate.  Wow, that's a great way to look at it.  Yeah, because if they're not laughing after, you know, the punchline.  That's the test.  If they laugh, it's funny.  If they don't, it ain't, no matter how much you think it is.  No, that ain't true.  Pause.  So you're at the funny bones of Virginia Beach.  McFoley's going to, TNA Impact, Thursday's 9 p.m. on Spike TV. 
[02:24:00]  Thanks for having me on, guys.  And it's live this week, which is important.  And in high def.  You guys have any questions for McFoley?  Yeah, who are you?  Oh, damn.  No, that's from, like, McFoley from, like, MacGyver?  No.  Wow.  No, I know.  I only get a chance to.  This guy, I gotta say, this guy's known all over the world.  The Middle Eastern countries love this man.  They love me in the Middle East.  Yeah.  You know, it's a big part of that.  Oh, you're David Hasselhoff. 
[02:24:30]  Germany.  It's Germany.  I think it's hilarious that they, like, recognize me and not Mick Foley.  Which is awful.  Well, Norton and I have something in common.  I've written.  What?  AIDS.  I've written three best-selling memoirs.  Write them by hand.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I like to study actors, whether it be comedic or dramatic.  And I was, you know, you kind of, when you're involved in wrestling, it's like a.  You're a wrestler.  You're a wrestler.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there it is.  Wow.  I didn't want to call it a wrestler. 
[02:25:00]  It's all right.  You guys are good.  Whose line is it anyway we're playing over here?  Do you usually work with a mask?  See, that was the deal.  I did.  For a few years.  I did.  Yeah, but I didn't recognize you without the mask.  Oh.  His best years were without the mask.  And the days.  Or without the mask.  That's amazing, because this guy is so recognizable.  I don't watch wrestling, so I wouldn't know.  That's just amazing.  If everybody watched it, I'd be in, you know, big trouble.  Yeah.  I was a big wrestling fan back in the day. 
[02:25:30]  What day was yours?  In the 50s, 60s.  50s, okay.  Yeah, 50s, 60s.  That's what I used to watch.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  What was the famous auditorium?  Olympic Auditorium.  Olympic, yeah.  Saas Palace, yeah.  And any time they do a wrestling scene in Hollywood, they always go to the Olympics.  The Olympic Auditorium.  That was the place.  Great atmosphere.  I knew all those guys, but that's the last time I watched it.  Like Freddie Blassie was probably your time.  Freddie Blassie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's the net geeks.  Lord Ethel Lathie.  Killer Kowalski.  Gorgeous George.  I saw Gorgeous George in person.  Yukon Eric was my guy. 
[02:26:00]  Yukon Eric?  Yeah.  He had his ear kicked off.  He had his ear kicked off.  Really?  I always felt the kinship with him.  Yeah, yeah.  It got his ear ripped off.  We got on the plane one time with a wrestler.  We were on the road, Dusty Rhodes.  Oh, yeah.  The American Dream.  And he had a scab all the way down the side, like three inches wide, all the way down the  side of his face.  And it says, what happened to you?  I got dragged across the ring last night.  People think that wrestling is all bullshit.  Uh-uh, man.  Uh-uh. 
[02:26:30]  He's missing an ear.  These guys are great.  Or a piece of one anyway, yeah.  Or a piece of his ear.  Really?  Gene Kaniski, do you remember him?  Yeah, I do remember Gene Kaniski.  And who was the guy that had the wrestling school in Calgary?  Because I knew those guys.  Stu Hart.  Stu Hart.  We were just talking about his son, Brat, was on the show.  Yeah, one of them died, right?  Oh, yeah.  One of them died, yeah.  See, I'm from Calgary, and my dad used to take me to wrestling matches.  Well, let me just explain something.  You pretty much know everything about wrestling, yet you don't know who this is.  You've just explained everything about wrestling. 
[02:27:00]  He came at the cut-off point, you know, like when you stop listening to the radio.  Yeah, maybe that's...  And, you know, when I was a kid, my grandmother and I used to watch Killer Kowalski,  and Edward Carpentier and all those guys.  Yeah, because it was Kowalski who came off the top rope with the eardrop on Yukon Eric,  and Eric had that real cauliflower ear.  That's right.  Yeah, it was snapped in half.  This is before steroids.  And Yukon Eric was...  Yeah.  You think these guys aren't athletes and it's all fake?  Jump off the top of the rope of a strand of the rig and take a flying leap. 
[02:27:30]  I don't know how much athletic ability that takes.  Mick did quite a few of those.  Quite a few.  Off the top of the cage during a cage match.  Oh, do that?  It was a fall that was just ridiculous.  I was maybe one of the guys who raised the bar to an unsafe fall.  Unsafe is exactly it.  To the insanity level.  How many bones did you break?  How many bones did you break?  Yeah, I never...  You know, somewhere in the mid-teens.  But, you know, I guess when you lose the ear, that's kind of a cool calling card. 
[02:28:00]  But he got thrown from the top of a cage and the cage collapsed and it wasn't supposed to, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And he fell to the mat.  How many feet?  16 feet.  16 feet.  Right on his back.  And the weird thing is, I guess it would be like improv comedy in the sense that, hey, this is not how things are supposed to end.  You're going to have to work with it, though.  Unlike a real sport where the action kind of stops when one guy is unconscious.  You know, your opponent tries to think of a way to keep things going while you revive. 
[02:28:30]  Give me an occupation out there.  Anyone?  Okay, injured wrestler.  Did you get sticked with needles and stuff coming in the ring?  Oh, you know what?  I was kind of lucky.  Last time I got stabbed with an umbrella in Guam by an old lady.  Old ladies, they do that.  They get these big hat pins and that and then the guys will buy these stickers.  We were kind of lucky in that.  It was accepted as entertainment so that the days of, like, guys shooting squirt guns of Drano at wrestlers, you know, 
[02:29:00]  was kind of over.  You know, you didn't have to fight for your age.  Well, they believed that the bad guy was really that bad guy.  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  And I remember.  Yeah, but when I was breaking in in the 80s, I mean, you'd get fired if you were seen even talking to a fan because they didn't think.  Yeah.  You know, you'd then.  Really?  It always seemed weird to me that, you know, 24-7, if you were a bad guy, you had to be that guy.  Yeah.  It was just like never in my nature, you know.  Yeah, and that's not really the way those guys are.  The bad guys are usually the nicest guys. 
[02:29:30]  Exactly.  Yeah, they really are.  Especially the guys like me who come from a background of being a bad guy.  And once you've been spit on and called horrible names for the first, like, five years of your career, it gives you a nice face, you know.  Yeah.  Face.  We're stalling because we're trying to get this video to the.  There's Mick.  Actually, those are.  You guys will never forget Mick Foley.  Those are tacks, right?  Those are tacks, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there we go.  But there is.  Can you see the tooth there?  He's slanting.  Oh, yeah.  Oh. 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  Yeah, here, you can see the tooth.  Yeah, the tooth is.  That's actually my tooth stuck in my nose.  For real, the nose went, the nose, the tooth went right through.  Yeah.  And you continue to wrestle anyway.  How much money were they paying you to do this?  You know, the guys I love are the referees.  Probably not enough.  They're the dumbest guys on the planet.  Yeah.  They never hear anything.  They never see anything.  Well, let me give you a Vince-ism at these production meetings.  The Undertaker, you know, Vicky Guerrero was in a wheelchair, and she was the general manager 
[02:30:30]  of SmackDown and was being forced by the board of directors to wrestle The Undertaker, you  know?  She was in a wheelchair?  She was in a wheelchair, but she was being forced to wrestle.  Got it.  And Vince was big on reality.  You know, these days, referees had to be taken seriously.  You had to obey the referee's rules.  And he comes down, and everybody goes, and remember, because we have reality, reality, or as real  as you can be when a woman in a wheelchair is facing The Undertaker. 
[02:31:00]  Cheech and Sean, watch this.  Yeah, this is me.  This isn't him getting knocked, were you knocked out at this point?  No, no, it was the one through the cage that knocked me out.  Yeah, this is the one off the side of the cage.  I know it's radio, but the reaction.  He's falling off the cage.  Oh!  Onto his back, onto a table.  Oh, man.  That's insanity.  Oh, that's all phony stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's all fake. 
[02:31:30]  You gotta watch.  He got thrown off the top of the cage, landing on the table, on his back.  How much did you get paid for that?  Did you get paid good?  I was a guest spot.  There was never, we were never under any kind of guarantee.  Like piecework or anything?  We never knew, but when I got the royalty, you know, the check from the pay-per-view, it was...  Substantial.  Yeah, it was substantial.  A little compensation for that?  Yeah, I came to regret.  You guys know that probably some of the best work you did in your careers was in arenas or small places you can't even remember. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And so in my case, I look back, I was like, maybe I shouldn't have done quite so much wild stuff out of 120 fans in Clarksburg, West Virginia.  I maybe should have saved that for the big arena.  I know that.  Here's the...  Watch.  Oh, this was a different...  That was a different match.  Another...  Oh, different one.  Jesus, dude.  Gets slammed.  Watch.  He just gets slammed and goes right through the top.  Oh!  Yeah, he's...  Were you knocked out there? 
[02:32:30]  No, no.  Actually, that was what I thought was the end of my career, and I didn't know that no one would buy my novels.  Yeah, we like beating up McFoley on the show, but the fact is, he was part of probably the greatest wrestling match ever.  Yeah, all right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Right?  Yeah.  They list it as pretty much the greatest match ever.  McFoley versus who?  The Undertaker.  The Undertaker.  Yeah.  Which I've always maintained, calling that the greatest match ever was like calling the Titanic the greatest cruise ever. 
[02:33:00]  I'm glad people remember it for so long.  You should take him with you.  He's a very funny man, too.  All right, we should wrap up.  So you got McFoley, of course, the great Cheech and Chong, Lydon Nation.com for all the tour dates.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Well, we want to make sure you got to know each other.  That was the best thing he could have said.  Who are you?  Yeah.  I never was.  That's okay.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Nice being with you.  All right.  We're going to get out of here, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks. 
[02:33:30]  Bye.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the roll.  How cool was that, man?  It was great.  Cheech and Chong.  I was telling Ant during the break that...  It's not often that we have, you know, celebrities come by that make you really nervous.  That was one today.  Really?  Yeah, man.  Because they're just legends.  I remember, like, listening to the Cheech and Chong records and cassettes or whatever the 
[02:34:00]  hell they were on back, back when I was a kid.  Back in the day.  And I would listen in my room to forget about my weird upbringing.  Get a few laughs before I went to bed.  Turn the tears into a little smile.  Oh, sure.  And now to, you know.  And then you fast forward a few decades and they're sitting on your show.  And you get to hang with them.  And that's just weird to me.  And they listen when you ask them a question and they answer it.  It is bizarre, right?  Yeah, isn't it?  It is. 
[02:34:30]  It's just a weird thing.  Because, I mean, the same thing happened with someone like Willie Nelson.  Like, people I used to watch on Johnny Carson as just a little nothing.  And then all of a sudden they're on our show.  To me, that is such a weird thing.  Cool as hell, you know?  30 years later.  I know.  But still.  Like, when you're in your living room watching TV with your family and you see Willie Nelson on Johnny Carson,  you never thought in a million years someday you'd be talking to that same guy. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Same with Cheech and Chong.  And, I don't know.  It was one of those moments today.  It was cool.  And they gave us great radio.  They were very good guests.  I hope my picture with them came out so I can show.  Oh.  You know what I'm going to have to do until I get my Jimmy Norton replica camera?  Um, I want my pictures taken with Jimmy Norton's camera.  That will absolutely happen.  Because the E-Rock camera.  That stinks.  Sucks a fucking big hunk of Nagel.  Wow.  I can't fucking deal with his camera.  Where is E-Rock? 
[02:35:30]  I don't know.  It, it, it, his camera stinks.  His pictures that he takes stink.  And I never get him anyway.  I get him like, I do get him.  Hold on.  I do.  But, like, years after the celebrity is dead.  I, I, let me see your camera.  How did your picture come out of teaching Sean with Anthony?  Yeah, let's see.  Let's take a look.  It's a 10 megapixel.  Is it?  Yeah, aren't you ready to give us another disc of pictures?  It's a 10, 10 negal pixel they call it.  What he does, he collects them, and then every three to four months, six months, he finally 
[02:36:00]  gives us a disc, and then all of a sudden you pop it in and you go, oh, that's right.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  That looks good.  I don't know why you have Mick Foley in there.  Believe me, I waited until he was out of the way.  I would have said, move, Mick.  He'd have to leave the room.  Especially when they said, who are you?  Who are you?  To Mick Foley, how great is that?  It's kind of funny because Mick's head is popping in like he's doing one of those asshole  things that we do all the time.  Oh, my shirt is taking a turn that makes it look like I've got a big fucking... 
[02:36:30]  Boner?  Belly.  Oh.  No, that's got to be remedied through Photoshop.  I'll just cut that off.  I'll fix that.  I'll do...  There you go.  All right, Nagel.  That's probably one of your better ones, so...  It is.  You're forgiven.  You ought to see when Ozzy was in here.  You do take horrid pictures.  When Ozzy was in here, he had forgotten to charge the thing, so there's some great photos  of me and Ozzy at the console here, but a couple of them were blurry, and I'm like,  why are any of them blurry?  That was with the old camera.  Why?  This dangin' H.  Let me see my picture.  Too broad.  Please.  This dangin' H.  Please.  We got Rich Voss, who's getting his fucking teeth yanked out. 
[02:37:00]  He's gonna do some of his classic of Rich Voss comedy without teeth later today for the  boys.  Oh, yeah.  I look thrilled to be with Cheech and Chong, and I love these guys.  Eh, whatever.  Why do we look at the pictures at all?  Oh, I know.  You're right.  Never send them.  Yeah, don't send them.  Ugh.  Uh, we got a handwriting analysis, uh, standing by.  We need to get, uh...  David!  Where's young David?  We've been meaning to do this for a while now.  Where's David? 
[02:37:30]  Intern David came in, and, uh...  He's a...  He's a...  He's a...  He's a bit on the strange side.  A bit weird.  He is...  He...  You're like...  Bar-line weirdo.  You're very much like many of the young Jewish, uh, kids that I grew up with, uh, around Long  Island.  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  He's a reason Jews get beat up, because people think all Jews are like that, like little  goofy, whiny type.  But they are. 
[02:38:00]  No.  Right?  No, I'm like a tough Jew.  You're not a tough Jew.  You are such a tough Jew.  What are you talking about?  No, I'm a tough...  Well, compared to him, I would have to agree, but...  No, listen, I mean, I'm not saying I went out on the street and I got in fights, but I  did stuff...  No, you can be tough without getting in fights.  There's stuff I've done in my life.  When you're a Jew, you're a Jew all the way.  Yeah, what have you done that's tough?  Uh, I don't know, uh...  You know, I...  I used to rob crack dealers and stuff. 
[02:38:30]  I was desperate.  You never robbed a crack dealer.  I almost did.  Did they give it to you?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  Yeah, they'd pull up.  I'd pull up on them.  I'd snatch it out of their hands.  Did you hold them up with your mouth on their cock?  Freeze.  Give me the crack.  Well, I'll suck the lifeblood out, you know.  It's my belly.  I don't know.  Don't make me swallow this cum.  Listen, if I looked like him and had...  As funny as I am on stage, if I looked like him, I'd have a career. 
[02:39:00]  Because they'd go, oh, he's a Jew, and the Jews look out for each other.  But they don't know I'm a Jew in this business.  They think I'm like...  Well, you say it every 30 seconds.  I never say it on stage.  I say it like one time in my act.  Maybe years ago I did.  The star of David tattooed on you.  Exactly.  Never again.  Yeah, but you see I walk around like this.  That's what the audience says.  Well, Hollywood, you fucking shut up.  And then leaving a Voss show.  Never again.  David, I don't plant that fucking scene.  I'm teasing because Voss is hysterical on stage.  I've heard more compliments from other comics about you on stage and how you can work a crowd and stuff. 
[02:39:30]  Believe me.  Well, thank you.  Voss is very funny.  Yeah, we want people to know that.  He's just a complete dolt on this show for some reason.  Do I just bring something?  Of course you do.  And the reason we want people to know that because we don't want Voss coming to us someday.  Like, I'm down on my lock.  You got a few bucks.  Oh, that's the next week.  Bonnie left me and took everything.  Could you just spare me some money?  See, Bonnie doesn't know how much money.  Like, I don't have a lot, but I was happy when they raised the FDIC. 
[02:40:00]  I said this to him.  I go, are they raising the FDIC to $250,000?  She goes, why the fuck would you care?  I go, I'm just wondering.  Oh, look at that.  You got it.  For insurance?  It's already raised to $250,000.  So it insures you up to there?  Yeah.  Because the government backs it.  And then they're talking about some kind of moratorium on it.  Like, you could put as much as you fucking want in there, and you can't lose it for like six months.  You know, they say that, but then when it happens, they're going, well, what the fuck are you going to do?  Yeah.  You lost your stock.  Yeah, we can't afford to pay us. 
[02:40:30]  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, take it.  David, do you resent this type of talk about you?  No.  From Richard?  No, not at all.  He's implying that he's tough and you're not.  No, no, he's the kind of Jew that, you know, he's...  Can't fight?  Well, no, I'm not saying he can't fight.  What he is is he's going to be very successful, you know, but, you know, you can tell he's a Jew.  When he walks down the street, he's got that Jewy Jew look to him.  I said that.  Thank you.  But Rich is a Jew, so he can say that. 
[02:41:00]  I said, David, hold on, it's like the N-word.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Of course you're saying it.  David, what do you think?  The nut candy.  No, hold on, hold on.  No offense, but everyone thinks exactly what he said when they see this game.  Yeah, but, you know...  Why can't he say it and I can't?  Because it's the same reason everyone thinks another word when certain people walk down the street,  but you can't say it.  I understand, but...  I'm just saying Jew is not good enough.  You really need Jewy Jew-Jew.  You have certain very stereotypical Jewish features. 
[02:41:30]  From your neck to the top of your head.  And things like that.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  No, there isn't.  It's just, that's the way it is.  Like, as far as being Italian goes, I know I whip my hands around and talk, and when I'm  with my family, we go, you know, hey, hey.  And he's greasy.  We drop the N-bomb all the time, and I'm greasy, and we don't want him living in our  neighborhood, and...  And saying you got a lot of J.J. characters.  Is that, like, the N-word?  I gotta call it... 
[02:42:00]  You could call him a J-E-J.  Right.  But he's gonna go with J.J.  Hey, what's up, J.J.?  J.J.  When I see him, he reminds me of my cousins that were always so smart and always did well.  All my cousins are, like, lawyers or just, like, rocket scientists.  They're really smart.  Yeah.  And I was, like, the black sheep or, you know, the...  You know, the...  Yeah.  Inferior red sheep.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Like the twins.  The Pete Rose haircut of the family.  Yeah.  Hey, we gotta get into this, because she's on the line.  I mean, we could... 
[02:42:30]  Oh, yes.  Kill Voss some more after Michelle hangs up.  Of course.  There's always time for that.  So, just to set this up, intern David, we got some of his handwriting.  I think he did, what, application for the internship and wrote down some stuff.  I don't remember.  He'd, like, write his...  Even when he's writing down his...  His bit.  His bit.  His sports and stuff.  It's this scrawl, this chicken scratch kind of weird handwriting.  Speaking of the kosher sports...  Very Zodiac killer.  Kenny was amazed at something.  Did you understand what you were doing today with your kosher sports? 
[02:43:00]  Yes, I did.  What was it?  What are you referring to?  Are you referring to the fact that it was a kosher sport and there are no Jewish references?  Yes.  Well, that was one thing.  That was one thing.  But there was something else.  There was something else that was a theme of the whole thing that Kenny's like, I can't  believe it, but I don't think he picked up on it.  Every story had a certain theme.  A sexual thing.  Yeah, sexual intuition.  That it was all like being liking men and stuff.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I picked up on that.  Very good.  Very good, David.  I picked up on that.  I did.  Oh, you've got to get Natterman and do Dueling Jews right next to each other. 
[02:43:30]  They're the same people.  Natterman will have...  I can't do his voice.  I wish I could.  Who's Natterman?  He's got the greatest voice.  Natterman.  Who's Natterman?  I'm Natterman.  Well, do we tell him, David, what this...  Oh, yeah.  So, anyway, he wrote a thing about...  It's not the autobiography that I wrote.  It's nice.  About wanting to be an intern.  And the writing creeped us out to a point.  We got a handwriting analysis.  And she's going to tell us a few things.  One handwriting analysis said, 
[02:44:00]  I don't want anything to do with this.  After she read this and saw his handwriting.  Do you write cursive or only print, David?  Only print.  Why can't you write cursive?  Only thing in cursive is when I sign my name.  Why not cursive?  Why do you say...  Stop saying cursive.  It's script.  Script, cursive, whatever.  My candy club's not a candy club.  You're writing cursive.  There's something about cursive.  I think that was cursive.  I can't write in script.  Did you practice your cursive today?  I don't like writing in script.  I write very sloppily.  But I can.  Because I can't write fast in script.  I have to do... 
[02:44:30]  That capital I is so weird.  I can't do it.  I don't like that at all.  See, it flows together.  I write much faster in cursive.  Nope.  Do you?  Can we say tabernacles?  Tabernacles.  When did you write this?  Tabernacles.  We have this woman waiting for us.  Yeah, she's on the line.  We have her handwriting.  Michelle.  Well, let's get her on.  Oh, all right, David.  Hey, David.  Wow, he's being pushy now.  Very assertive.  Hi, Michelle.  Oh, hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Hello.  Hi.  I have your handwriting, David. 
[02:45:00]  How are you?  Well, we want to know a little bit about you quickly first, Michelle.  What kind of...  Let's start by...  What's your last name?  Because none of us could say it.  It says Dresbold.  My last name is Dresbold.  D-R-E-S-B-O-L-D.  Like the girls dress and dress bold.  Dress bold.  Dress bold.  Why don't you dress bold?  So it's Michelle Dresbold.  And what are your credentials?  Well, I'm a handwriting expert.  I also go to court. 
[02:45:30]  I have training with U.S. Secret Service.  Oh, cool.  Kicks some ass then, too, right?  I do all kinds of criminal-type cases where if there's, like, you know, a handwritten  note at a crime scene, it's my job to go there and try to help law enforcement figure  out who it is.  So, like, what was your best case or whatever?  Like, a case where you brag about?  One of my cases that I guess I brag about was a young college student who put a building 
[02:46:00]  on fire because he had a crush on a girl on the first floor.  Wrote a note to her parents, and what he was really trying to do was scare the girl in  the building to come back to him.  So, unfortunately, he did kill someone in the fire, and I linked the letter he wrote to  his parents saying he put the fire on, and it was anonymous to him, and he's now in prison  for life.  How did you link it?  Was it personality stuff or other handwriting samples? 
[02:46:30]  This was really other handwriting samples.  He had written handwriting from different handwriting samples to friends.  They gave the handwriting samples to the police, and there was this note basically to his parents  that was anonymous but said, too bad that fire had to kill that kid.  It was meant for your daughter.  Oh, that's pleasant.  And anyhow, I linked that handwriting plus other things from the letters he had written to 
[02:47:00]  friends to the letter from the parents, and that was the connection to this fire, and that  was used in his trial.  Do you ever work with profilers and stuff like the FBI?  I do.  In fact, I am a very good profiler.  I'll work as a profiler, and I'll work with, let's say, companies that are trying to hire  people.  Who should they hire?  Or let's say someone's dating somebody.  Should they date this person?  Is this person really crazy?  Are they wacky? 
[02:47:30]  So I work with all kinds of people.  What can you tell?  Obviously, there are certain things that crazier people do, like do they drop their whys a certain  way?  What are you looking for when you're analyzing someone's personality?  Well, I talk about this in my book, which is sex, lies, and handwriting.  Nice plug.  Nice plug.  That sex thing sells.  But in the book I talk about, there are certain features that will show up over and over and  over again in certain types of personalities. 
[02:48:00]  For example, let's just say somebody takes their eye dots or their periods, and they take  them and they make them real big and thick and grind them into the page.  It means that they're really angry and have a lot of inner resentment.  Or if you see somebody's handwriting, and on the first part of their letters, there's like  a little check mark.  You can only make angles when you're angry.  So somebody who has a lot of little check marks that don't belong all throughout their  handwriting, they have a lot of anger and they can like go off if you like push them 
[02:48:30]  just a little bit too much.  I'm not sure what you mean by check marks.  No, do I.  Like a little angle.  Let's just say you make a, let's just say a letter like, let's find a good one, like  an N.  But when you start the N, instead of just making your hand go down, at the very start  is a teeny little check mark.  It's not big.  It's just a teeny check mark.  It's like almost like your hand twitched when you were putting the pencil to paper. 
[02:49:00]  When you're relaxed, hand makes curves.  When you're, like if you get real angry, you can only make angles.  So somebody who's very angry will have these teeny little angular marks all over the place.  That's just one example.  There's, there's all different types of examples.  And like, obviously like different types of people have different personalities.  And for, for, let's say somebody's hand running goes way, way to the right too. 
[02:49:30]  That means they're just so emotional that they can, if they will not think correctly and  they'll just go with their emotions or their hand running is way to the left.  It means that they'll talk to you, but you won't know anything that they're saying.  You know, they'll keep everything in their head.  So every little thing in handwriting shows what's going on in your brain.  I've been, I've been very curious as to very tiny writing.  People that write very small. 
[02:50:00]  What is, what is that?  Can I, can I guess before you give an answer?  Go guess.  I'm going to guess it has something to do with compartmentalizing.  It's an OCD thing.  It has something to do with like the same type of people who compartmentalize everything in  their life.  I say.  Sort of.  I say low self-esteem.  I mean, someone who writes really small, and I tell people this in my lectures, take your  name and write it smaller, smaller, smaller, and so small you can barely see it.  There are people who are super focused.  If it gets too small, they're retreating from public, they're like retreating from society. 
[02:50:30]  Ah, that's interesting.  Sure is.  Because we know a couple of people that write very small and retreating from society would  be something because society probably, you know.  Didn't approve of their, uh.  Any extreme, way too big.  Where they put their.  Way too small.  Oh, and way too big would be.  An ego tip.  Somebody who like has to get all the attention in the world.  Like, hi, look at me.  They'll write you.  Fuck, we should all, we should all wrote something before she did this. 
[02:51:00]  Well, we.  That would have been hilarious to see who had the biggest print.  We could do this by just taking something we've written already.  Right, or you could write something right now.  Except Voss, he hasn't written anything in years.  Sorry, Rich.  That's good.  I lie down.  So wait, you read, you read David's, uh, thing.  David?  I did read David's handwriting.  Now, obviously, uh, it's all in, he doesn't write in cursives.  A lot of people don't write in cursive, especially men.  Um, in fact, a pretty high percentage of men never write cursive. 
[02:51:30]  Is it, is it weird, like, is this weird?  Somebody told me that I make, like, the letter I, I make huge, like, like, when I'm writing I.  And somebody says, because my penis is large.  I think that's the reason.  All right, she goes right along with you, Jimmy.  Michelle.  Just some of David's laugh.  Oh, he laughs with gusto.  That was hilarious, though.  Michelle, what does it, what does it mean when you pepper your writing with the N-word? 
[02:52:00]  You just kind of pepper it in there.  That means you have, um, some not so nice tendencies.  All right, let's get into what, uh.  I've been told.  David wrote my autobiography.  You got a copy of it a while ago.  Right, that's true.  The first paragraph, my name is David.  I was born in 1982.  I first lived in a town called Aberdeen, which is in New Jersey.  I lived there for almost 10 years.  Now, obviously, that's.  We're not going to read this whole thing, but I'm just like, you know, whatever.  Well, that's obviously worded like a well-written adult.  Yeah.  Well.  This is my book report. 
[02:52:30]  When I look at handwriting, I don't look at what somebody writes.  Oh.  What words are.  I look at the handwriting.  And, in fact, often I'll just take a handwritten page and turn it upside down, and I will give you  an analysis, because it's not from what the person says, but from the actual way they write.  Ah.  Let's get to the meat and potatoes of this.  What's David?  What's David all about?  What do you got on him?  Wow.  Okay, well, I'll tell you what I found about David from his handwriting.  Sure.  David is sort of like, in a semi, and when he wrote this, it's sort of like a childlike 
[02:53:00]  or very youthful type of handwriting, almost like, you know, he said he was born in 1982,  so it's actually a younger handwriting than that.  It's a very, like a late bloomer's type of handwriting.  He also, like, he takes his periods, and he does make them pretty big.  Yeah.  That means he's, the way he does it, David can be obsessive.  So when he thinks about something, he thinks about it over and over and over and over again 
[02:53:30]  in his head.  That's actually true.  Yes.  And, like, let's say, David, if you were mad at somebody, like, in third grade, and you  saw them on the street, you still would not like them.  It's like, oh, I didn't like him in third grade, and I still don't like him.  That's pretty normal, though.  If you like someone, you're real nice to them, and if you don't like them, you'll  stay that way.  I did notice something in your handwriting, David, that I thought was interesting.  You sometimes reverse letters, like your Ds turn into Bs, and what that means is probably 
[02:54:00]  growing up, you had a little bit of a learning disability, which might have made school a  little hard for you.  And a lot of people are really bright.  They will reverse letters like you do.  I did that all the time when I was, like, in first and second grade.  Okay, well, it meant that you had a little bit, maybe even a visual learning disability.  And so probably high school was maybe difficult for you, and it could be that you're very,  very bright, but reading and memorizing what you read is hard for you. 
[02:54:30]  That would make him not bright.  This woman, she's got it nailed down to the right.  She got it.  I would do that a lot.  My lowercase Bs and Ds, I would screw it up if I was writing something real quickly.  I would screw it up and be like, oh, that's, you know, of course that's a D. It goes the  other way.  Okay, that really means a lot of people have that.  And you can be very, very bright and do that.  Yeah, I am.  I'm very bright.  It's a learning disability. 
[02:55:00]  And a lot of people who do that have to take other paths in life rather than, like, what  we quote the normal path.  Opie, stop laughing, you bick.  What are you saying?  I'm not normal.  Shut up.  It's better in a way you can be quite bright.  In fact, a lot of really, including Einstein, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a lot of people, he  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Einstein.  I've never heard them put in the same category.  They both reverse their letters.  You're not Blair's cousin Jerry from The Factual Life. 
[02:55:30]  But that can mean you're bright.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Memorizing written words are hard.  You wind up usually doing something more creative and in your own vein, and that's where you  can excel in life.  Yes, David can excel.  Can people fake it?  Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.  Oh, no, no.  Fucking David.  Crack up young David.  Can people fake, fake, like, they might know it'll be analyzed and fake it so it can't be 
[02:56:00]  analyzed?  Wow.  Rich is paranoid.  Not really.  I mean, you can fake it, meaning somebody can write in all capital letters trying to  block prints and you can't read them.  But even if, let me tell you, if you just said, oh, Michelle, I'm going to write with,  let's say you're right-handed, I'm going to write with my left hand to disguise it, every  trait that came out with your right hand will come out in your left hand.  And in fact, they sometimes do an experiment with people and they make them write with their 
[02:56:30]  foot, and I can still analyze their personality.  Really?  Daniel Day-Lewis.  I got 20 jokes right there.  I know what else you can tell.  Yeah.  Oh, God, it's such a good joke.  And it's topical.  What else do you want to know about David?  Anything?  Whatever you got on him.  Yeah, is there, the thing with the period being very, now you said earlier that that  was kind of an anger thing. 
[02:57:00]  It is a little bit of an anger.  It can be obsession.  In his case, it's more like obsession because it's big but it's not huge.  But it does mean that he can be inwardly angry and have a hard time expressing it outwardly.  And what does it mean, like I see some of these letters on the page that he went over the  letter twice and they're darker than the other ones.  Like there's one where he spells school and the L in school is like he went over it a couple  of times.  It's darker than the rest of the word.  Bay, the Y, the H in three. 
[02:57:30]  Like there's quite a few of those.  Okay, when you go over letters over and over again, again, it's an obsessive quality because  you're not satisfied with it just the way it is.  You have to go over and over.  So it's someone who can get quite obsessive and when he's into something, it's hard for  him to move on.  Yeah.  It's a little, it's a sign of obsession.  So that's just something David has to work on.  A little bit of thoughts get in his head and they're hard to get them out of it.  What do you, now what do you consider when someone writes the word Aberdeen and they begin 
[02:58:00]  with a capital A as they should and the capital A is smaller than the three E's in the sentence  which take up the entire line?  Well, that, that is true.  Technically, that isn't really the way it should be.  Of course not.  That, it actually, that is also sort of like, David, do you have a, do you have a little  bit of a visual problem growing up?  Sure.  Yeah.  So that's really what David's handwriting, it's just a little bit, he has a little harder 
[02:58:30]  time visually.  Did you, David?  Yes, I did.  What was your problem?  It's a lot of disabilities, like learning disabilities and stuff.  My glasses.  Yeah, as you can see.  David, that's where David, his handwriting, sometimes when you see things like this, like  if I had seen this, and I, like, I obviously don't know David, but I would say, David, you  have a little bit of a learning disability.  That's correct.  And you're really smart and your visual sense is a little hard, it's a little harder for  you, so you need a little bit of different learning skills. 
[02:59:00]  And that's why his letters, actually, most people's words, the first letter will be big  and then it will get smaller and actually go the other way.  And that's probably because he's had a visual perception problem.  Are handwriting analysts, amongst other profilers, like, looked down at, kind of like chiropractors  are to doctors?  I mean, do you get the respect that, you know, like the forensic people get and, you know,  the ones that are really solving the crimes?  Well, I think maybe some people are looked down on. 
[02:59:30]  For example, I don't think I am, and I think, I actually think that it's a pretty well-respected  field, though you have people who might be a little bit, like, don't know much and try  to pretend they know everything.  I think it's hokum.  Yeah.  There can be a little bit of that with people, but I'll tell you what, the more you know about  it, it's just a fascinating field.  And I find that, like, I work a lot with different lines.  I work that in today.  And they love it, and I have, I mean, I'll give you an example. 
[03:00:00]  When I first walked into, I'm from Pittsburgh, and when I first walked into the detective  bureau, they ruled their eyes, like, oh, who's this wacky girl?  But after they saw what I could do, after a while, I had a lecture for the detectives,  and they were sitting out the hall.  That's how, the reputation of how accurate a handwriting profile can be.  And after people start to find out how accurate it is, you know, you'll just get people from 
[03:00:30]  all over, actually all over the world coming, trying to say, help me to figure this thing  out.  Well, I'm pretty impressed with her assessment of David, because that really does kind of  hit the nail on the head there.  You pretty much got it right.  Oh, thank you, David.  Hit the Jew on the head.  Michelle, from his handwriting, has he killed small animals?  I hope not.  No, he hasn't, but he does worry a lot.  Worry a lot.  He's a worrywart.  What about his penis size?  Oh, it's fine.  You can tell from the handwriting? 
[03:01:00]  It's just fine.  Can you tell from the handwriting?  Well, I wouldn't tell from the handwriting.  She hinted at that.  Well, there are things you can tell about, like, you sure can tell a lot about someone's  sexuality through their handwriting.  Oh.  That's what we're getting at with David.  Okay.  What can you tell?  There we go.  We're looking at a version, aren't we?  Well, sort of.  I mean.  How can you tell about the sexuality?  Yeah.  Okay, well, I'll give you, like, an example.  Like if the beginning of one word is rammed into the end of the other word.  Will that tell you something? 
[03:01:30]  There's something in it.  In David, since he prints, it's a little harder to tell, but if somebody writes your  lower loop, like your G loop, your Y loop, bottom of the F, anything that has a lower  loop represents anything that goes on from your belly button down.  It can be someone very physical or someone very sexual.  So the way somebody makes their lower loops shows what they're like sexually and how much  emphasis they put into their sexual life.  Now we know why Anthony goes through so much paper. 
[03:02:00]  Maybe.  What are your lower loops?  Like, let's say someone...  Poor Anthony.  He can only get four lines per page.  It's okay.  Mine, my handwriting's worse.  Oh, wait.  In cursive, you mean, right?  Well, it can be cursive or if you print, you still...  Unless you print in all caps, you will have, let's say, a G, a lower loop of a G.  My lower loops are fatter, bigger. 
[03:02:30]  Okay, fat, lower loops mean that you are sexual, you fantasize a lot.  About what?  You like to be active and get bored very easily.  I like to what?  You get bored easily.  Cool.  If I wrote you a letter, could you tell if I ever blew anybody for coke from a letter?  Yeah, especially if you titled it, I blow people for coke.  Hey, Michelle, what about people that write in all caps? 
[03:03:00]  I didn't catch that one.  Okay, if somebody writes in all capital letters, well, first of all, one of the reasons men  print and women more likely cursive, cursive is connected.  Emotionally, a lot of women like to connect.  The more you print emotionally, the little bit more you separate.  Somebody who prints in all capitals.  All right, stop yelling, LOL.  Yeah, they don't want you to know anything about them.  Stop talking.  It will almost always be a man, and he'll print in all capitals. 
[03:03:30]  And it means that person doesn't want you to know much about what's going on inside their  head.  So did you read the Ramsey note, the JonBenet Ramsey note?  I'm sure you've seen it.  Yeah.  In fact, I have a little chapter on that in my book.  What do you think of it?  I mean, obviously, I think the family has been cleared.  Mm-hmm.  What do you think of that note?  Well, what I think...  All right, that's about all we have time for, for Michelle. 
[03:04:00]  That note is a very bizarre note.  And, you know, it's one big piece of evidence in that case.  One piece of evidence you definitely can link to the murder.  Who do you think wrote it, though?  Was it a family member or no?  I really won't tell you, but I do compare it to a family member in the book.  And I show you the comparisons to one of the family members, and I leave it up to the reader  to figure out what they really think from looking at the comparison. 
[03:04:30]  I really think it would be very...  I mean, you have to think about that note that somebody wrote it in the house, because  the note was written in that house.  It wasn't brought to that house.  It was written there.  Now, if you've ever tried to write a note, a three-page note, and try to disguise your  handwriting and see how long that takes, so if it was an intruder, and I'm not giving any 
[03:05:00]  opinion on this right now, but if it was an intruder, you would have to have somebody  who would have had to sit in that house for hours writing a note.  And I don't think you can take that out of the equation of what might have happened  here.  But, you know, there's no answer, really, obviously, but I think that note is a huge  piece of evidence in this case.  What would you consider an attribute of handwriting for somebody that is dangerous? 
[03:05:30]  You mean something that someone very dangerous...  Yeah.  Is it that they put little devil horns all over the place?  You know what?  You're not so far off, because there is something called a devil's fork, and I write about that  also in, I'll plug the name of my book again, Sex, Lies, and Handwriting.  I talk about something called a devil's fork, and you will see it not in very many people's  handwriting, but you see it in Ted Bundy's handwriting.  Oh.  Many serial killers' handwriting.  It looks on the bottom of a letter.  It can show up different places, and it looks just like a devil's fork. 
[03:06:00]  And I actually just had a case recently with somebody who was accused of murder, and right  in her handwriting is the devil's fork.  And I'm like, oh my God, and I was busy showing it to people.  It's something you do not see often.  I'll tell you a story about the devil's fork, if you'd like.  Well, Hallam, before you do that, can you tell me what it looks like?  Because...  It looks like...  Okay, you have a straight line.  Okay.  And then, like, at the bottom, there would be a curve at the bottom where the straight 
[03:06:30]  line is, so it looks exactly like what a devil's pitchfork would look like, and you will find  it somewhere in the handwriting.  That sounds like something that's, like, you'd have to do as a calculated thing, and wouldn't  just be an errant pen stroke or something.  I think the interesting thing is, is that it is not calculated.  It shows up, and the person has no idea they put it in there.  Is it like, almost like, picture a letter Y, a capital Y, a horseshoe upside down with 
[03:07:00]  a line under it.  Would you consider that a devil's fork?  Yes.  Okay.  But usually, it will be, like, say, do a Y, and the bottom straight part, which would  normally be the loop, but it goes down, and then you get this curved, like a sad face at  the bottom of the straight Y hanging down.  So it looks like a sad face on the bottom of what would normally be the loop of the Y, 
[03:07:30]  but the Y doesn't loop.  It just goes straight down, and then at the bottom is a sad face intersecting.  Is it in your book?  Yeah, it's in the book.  I can see how that can happen.  I can't even tell you what page, but it's...  What page?  Because I want to see it.  When they talk about certain serial killers, they will have this, and it looks just like  what you would, if you were drawing a picture of a devil, and he was holding a pitchfork,  what the pitchfork would look like.  Michelle, Michelle, I'm sorry.  They do not know they do it.  What, I'm sorry, I'm looking at Alistair Crowley's signature, too. 
[03:08:00]  What page is the devil's pitchfork on?  Because I have your book here.  Okay, what page?  Oh, here's the book.  Let's see where we have the devil's.  I know it's in the chapter about Ted Bundy, and what she's called...  What could you tell by Alistair Crowley's handwriting that he was a silly goose?  Alistair Crowley, actually, that's called...  It's in the chapter called, is that a phallic symbol, or are you just happy to see me in  your handwriting, or are you just happy to see me?  No.  You will find people, and they will actually put phallic symbols or male parts in their 
[03:08:30]  handwriting, and that is somebody who has to get their kicks sexually from something  perverse.  Really?  Or a little different than normal.  God, that explains a lot, because after I put the letter Y, dripping from the bottom,  I'll put little things of the Y's boo.  Sorry, I felt a bomb coming on.  If you look at that, like phallic symbols, example Michael Jackson has it in his handwriting.  When he writes the word child. 
[03:09:00]  A lot of times it happens in, like a phallic symbol, I once saw it in one of my friends  of females' handwriting, and I looked at her handwriting, and I had seen her handwriting  many times, and I'll make up a fake name for her.  I said, Carol, look, you have a phallic symbol, why is it in your handwriting?  She goes, oh my, I said I had sex the first time in nine years yesterday, and it showed up  right in her handwriting.  Wow, that's wild.  If you're thinking about sex a lot, or obsessed, or something that's a little different, it 
[03:09:30]  will show up sometimes when it's never showed up before.  All right, so I'm trying to find an example.  You were telling a story about...  I'm looking for that page as we're talking.  Oh, here, let me see.  Yeah, the devil's fork, because...  I found one, well, there is a devil's fork on page 86, but I'm trying to find you there.  I have a better devil's fork, and I'm looking, looking, and I know where it is, but  I can't...  Oh, it's got to be before that.  Oh, I see. 
[03:10:00]  Right.  Oh, unless it's after that.  We can talk as I'm looking for the devil's fork.  All right.  Hey, I want to ask you about...  I have the devil's fork.  Here it is.  Yeah, what page?  Um...  It's in the chapter, Bad to the Bone, page 151.  At the very bottom is the word living, and it's written by Ted Bundy.  Do you see the word on 151?  Yes.  At the very bottom, the word living.  On the L.  Oh, right, that little three-pronger thing there. 
[03:10:30]  Jesus Christ, how the fuck does he do that without knowing?  What?  He doesn't know he's doing that?  He doesn't know he's doing it.  Sometimes it comes from other letters or words that connect weirdly.  That is creepy.  This is something he doesn't know he's doing.  He doesn't know it's showing up.  You have that also, I think, in the Green Valley Killer, and the BTK Killer has it also.  They do not know they're doing it.  That's so weird.  It's just...  Because when you write, what you're really doing is putting brain prints from your head onto the page. 
[03:11:00]  In fact, Ted Bundy, when they interviewed him, they said, he said, well, I don't...  He never admitted to the killing, but he did say, well, I think there was a devil inside of me, and maybe the devil did some bad things.  And the person who does this will never admit that they did it, because they actually feel that this devil inside of them might have done something, but they didn't.  And it will show up...  It only...  In my personal life, it only showed up one time. 
[03:11:30]  A woman who wrote me said she's dating a man, and she continued dating him.  And I looked at his handwriting, and he had the devil's fork in it.  And I said, do not run away.  You know, get out of here.  Wow.  Don't even go near him.  And she broke up with him.  And it turns out he had a very long criminal history that she didn't know about.  Holy...  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  What do you know about E-Rock's fork?  That's a...  Yes.  That would be real full. 
[03:12:00]  A lot of letters piled on top of each other.  Titanium fork.  I didn't hear you.  Oh, never mind.  That's an inside thing.  Yeah.  Making people laugh.  Michelle, I got to tell you, we got your book ahead of time, and I wasn't going to read this, but now...  It looks great.  You have to read it.  Well, no, I'm going to read it.  Oh, shut up, David.  I'm giving you a compliment.  I mean, now I really want to read this.  This looks great.  Just seeing all these different forms of writing in here from serial killers and such, it's... 
[03:12:30]  Wow.  It looks really interesting.  Sex, lies, and handwriting.  On your website, you talk about Obama and McCain, don't you, and their handwriting?  I have all the presidential candidates and other people who were running, you know, I have all the people who were running for this election.  All right.  First of all, are you a Democrat or a Republican?  Well, I won't tell you, but I can tell you stuff about the different candidates that can be quite interesting.  I can tell you, do you want to hear something about John Edwards?  Yes. 
[03:13:00]  I mean, okay, this might give you a clue.  When I first was doing, I did everybody's handwriting about a year or so ago when they were first running.  And actually, at that time, I was pretty much an Edwards supporter.  And I saw his handwriting.  And do you remember I told you that if it goes to the right, you think emotionally.  If it goes too much to the right, you're too emotional.  And I talk about in the book something where if your letter D falls over way to the right, it means that you've forgotten logic and you go with your pure emotions. 
[03:13:30]  And when I did John Edwards' handwriting, his handwriting, first he has the very long lower loops, which means he enjoys sex.  And, but the rest of his handwriting goes so far to the right, but his D completely leans over to the right, which means that he thinks emotionally and leaves all, he can forget about logic completely. 
[03:14:00]  And when I did his sample, I said to my editor, I said, why does John Edwards' handwriting go this way?  I can't understand it.  I like him so much.  Why is this happening?  Why is this going on?  And, and of course, you know, about eight months later, it came out that he had had that affair.  And he goes to the hotel in the middle of this.  That was so stupid to go there.  You know, when you think about it, I mean, he's a pretty smart, I mean, very smart man.  But emotionally, I mean, that's what that D shows. 
[03:14:30]  When it goes over all the way to the right, you have forgotten logic completely.  And I talk about that in my book with some certain people.  And, and so after that, I thought, well, I can't vote for him.  Something's going on in his life.  And, and right, you know, to, to jeopardize your whole career for a little fling.  That's not, you know, it's a little bit off.  I'm just going to type everything from now on.  No kidding.  I want to know I can, you know, I'm taking something called statement analysis now. 
[03:15:00]  So even when somebody types, I can tell from the words what they're really saying underneath it.  Oh, well, I should hope so.  That's what I hope when someone reads it, they can tell by the words what I'm trying to say.  But you're saying it's called writing.  You're taking a course in reading.  Well, it's called statement analysis.  And what that means is that every single thing you say, it's the way you word things.  Now, I'm not a big expert yet on that, but I am studying it.  And, and, and, and, you know, it's hard if you're just listening, but if somebody writes something down, you, you can tell from how they worded something, example, where they're lying. 
[03:15:30]  Michelle, we're experts as well.  Okay.  You are a Democrat who loved John Edwards.  Well, not anymore, but I do like, I did like him.  I have to say that.  You gave, you gave that away pretty easily.  Hey, uh, Obama and McCain, what do you got on those two?  Because now obviously.  And I did this again like a year or so ago.  But just in his signature, in the O, he makes a sign that's called a phi sign, P-H-I. 
[03:16:00]  It's a Greek sign that means the perfect ratio and that everything should be in this perfect ratio.  And I saw that and I wrote about it on my website.  And so I really, when people called me and said, oh, on the Democratic convention, he was going to make the background a Greek form to make it look Greek.  I said, oh, that goes with his signature.  What does the phi sign look like?  A phi sign looks like a zero with a line flashed through it.  It's all right.  We got a picture of E-Rock with a line through him. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  I mean, well, a zero with a line and it's a phi sign.  When you see symbols in people's handwriting, sometimes you don't even know what they mean and you have to, like, go through your, like, journal or whatever.  But people will put symbols in their handwriting that have some meaning personally to them.  But what does that mean with Obama?  I think it means that he, his basic core belief system is that everything should be in a certain proportion and a ratio.  And I think...  Socialism! 
[03:17:00]  He probably studied Greek when he was in college.  Oh, speak Greek?  You know, I bet he had an interest in it and something about that Greek philosophy.  Then why is it a circle with a line through it?  Well, that's how they make a phi sign.  Do you speak Greek?  I spell a little Greek.  I speak.  Yesu dikhanis.  That means hello.  How are you?  It's very interesting.  I love the devil's pitchfork.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, the devil.  Yeah, it's amazing. 
[03:17:30]  And the McCain thing.  I mean, we got to, like...  John McCain, his handwriting, one thing about it, it is very scrunched up.  And a lot of times...  Like him.  ...somebody has an in it.  Now, I have his handwriting.  The handwriting I have was from four years ago.  And it's very scrunched.  When people are physically ill, you can see it in their handwriting.  At the time when he wrote this, he was ill or impending illness.  And I think he had had a lot of problems in the last four years. 
[03:18:00]  And you could see that right in his handwriting.  Another interesting thing about McCain is you think, you know, McCain is a big family name.  But he writes his first name, John, very large.  And his last name, Small.  And what that means, if you write your last name, Small, and your first name, Large,  it means I want to make it as John.  I do not want to have to...  I'm going to not rely on being the McCain name.  I want to make it on my own.  What does it mean, though, when they're ill? 
[03:18:30]  They're scrunched together?  Like the letters are...  Somebody has illness.  There will be different signs depending on what illness they have.  You can tell a tremendous amount about a person's health when you look at their handwriting.  Yeah, I've got a jumble of scribble here, but apparently it's Robert Reed's autograph.  Okay.  Well, I don't know about that.  Well, of course not.  I mean, it's all scrunched together?  Yeah.  Extremely.  It's so scrunched together, it's just a line.  And he's got a lot of zeros with the slash through it. 
[03:19:00]  On handwriting and illness and how it's related.  Yeah.  And I wrote something on my website about how you can predict...  Well, it's a long story, but I'll make it short for you.  How somebody had a tumor and how you saw it in his handwriting.  And another one of my...  Pudding.  ...said that, and she saw her husband's handwriting, and she said to him,  Oh, I don't want to scare you, but I think you have a tumor on your kidney, and he got a tumor, and he did have it. 
[03:19:30]  Well, just for the handwriting?  He was tinkled on the paper.  Actually, he was a musician, and he had become very good friends of mine, and I went and we visited each other.  They live in Texas, and we're watching his handwriting, because as things disappear in his handwriting, we're watching to monitor his health.  Is it true that Olivia Newton's John's W's look like U's?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  That one, I don't know. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, what does it mean if you sign stuff with just...  If you just sign your last name?  You'll hear a laugh in the background for the next ten minutes, by the way.  I just want to acknowledge that.  But if you just sign stuff just using your last name, what does that indicate?  And if you don't put your first name at all, most of you put at least their initials.  Sorry, I know she's sorry.  But if you only do your last name, it means something like you're sort of taking away of your personal thing. 
[03:20:30]  You're not trying to, like, really expose yourself.  You're just, like, sort of putting up an image.  Wow.  So that's what that shows.  Okay.  And just for my personal interest, did you study Kurt Cobain's suicide letter?  I did have it, and I have looked at it.  In fact, I haven't looked at it for quite a while now, but I do remember it. 
[03:21:00]  And it was a little...  Most things that will show up in suicide letters, a lot of times the person's handwriting will go way downhill,  meaning that the slope of the handwriting goes...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That means that they're feeling very, very depressed.  Oh.  And I would think...  And his handwriting was very erratic, and it means very erratic thinking.  So the one thing you want to look for in somebody is if their handwriting starts to go way, way downhill,  it means that they're, like, falling mentally downhill. 
[03:21:30]  And I think he...  I remember he had that.  Like I said, I haven't looked at it now for quite a while.  What if you have a droopy C?  A droopy C?  Yeah.  It means that you need a facelift.  I don't know.  No, I was thinking droopy C.  I don't think it means that much.  And, like, my D always goes off to the left.  Your D goes to the left, not to the right?  A little bit, like sometimes.  What's that mean?  I don't know.  Your D actually slants more. 
[03:22:00]  That means that sometimes you're very emotional, except there are times where you quickly take back control.  Yeah.  And what's the difference between a good and a bad N?  Well, there's no good or bad Ns, but one thing you want to look for in the N, like, if you have a base in your N, it means you worry too much.  Really?  Uh-uh.  Yeah, I worry about my Ns.  Well, don't worry too much.  All right.  Thank you.  I didn't know that. 
[03:22:30]  I'm glad you could solve those problems.  Some individual letters mean something, how they're made, and others don't mean all that much.  It's the general look of the writing also.  So, um, but there are little things that, every little thing you put on that page means something about you.  Wow.  You know what, I find this a little odd.  Whenever I'm writing on the front of an envelope, like an address, and not so much anymore, but I used to, if it wasn't lined paper, I would always kind of drop off to one side or something. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, well, that's fine.  It would take me to go, if it's not lined, do you mean that the handwriting went uphill or downhill, or what do you mean?  Yeah, it was like, it would start out good, and then by the end of the address, like, it would be dropping down, like going to a down-sloping.  Like you're writing on a down angle.  Yeah, downhill.  Yeah.  I could never keep it straight on lined.  I feel like you don't want your handwriting going down.  I always tell people not to write on lined paper, because lined paper means that you need to follow rules and regulations. 
[03:23:30]  Ideally, your handwriting should go uphill a little bit.  Yeah?  Yeah, and that means you're a little more upbeat, positive.  I'm just going to turn the page a little bit.  There's something called handwriting therapy.  When your handwriting goes downhill, it means you can see things in a negative light.  Yeah.  Tell me about it.  No shit.  We do this exercise where we make you write uphill, and that will actually turn a negative mood into a much positive state.  But realistically, all I have to do is really turn the page clockwise a little bit, and I'm fine, right? 
[03:24:00]  And get back to normal.  Well, no.  Realistically, all you would have to do is when you write, instead of letting your hand drop down, is actually go,  I'm going to make it level, or I'm going to go up, and force it up.  Yeah.  And actually, as you do that, you will feel better and happier.  And they've done studies with really successful people, and the thing that's in common with them is almost always their handwriting goes slightly up. 
[03:24:30]  What was that?  All right, Michelle.  Who's that?  Hold on, Michelle.  I heard you in a voice.  Yeah, hold on.  Michelle, who's the writer of Sex, Lies, and Handwriting.  We've got a bunch of really good questions coming in.  We've got Stephanie in Atlanta.  Hi, Stephanie.  Hey, Michelle.  Hey, so what does it mean when a woman writes in all caps?  Okay.  I rarely...  Now everyone's wondering what's wrong with that.  Does she write in all caps because it's part of her profession?  For example, is she an architect or an engineer? 
[03:25:00]  No, she's a woman.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's why Mr. Brady did it.  We're talking about recipes, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Recipes.  If a woman writes in all caps, I always say to her, it does mean it's time to avoid a little  bit of things emotionally, and I say, think back of when you started, and you were probably  going through something, a little emotional problem or trauma at that time.  Think back of when you started to write in all capital letters, and that's probably an 
[03:25:30]  issue or a trauma that you need to work out in your life.  So very few women do write in all caps.  Does that make sense to you?  Yeah.  It's very interesting, though.  No way.  I mean, do you write in all caps?  I do.  All the time.  I never write any other way but in all caps.  How do you...  When you learned in school, did you write cursive and then somewhere in your life turn into all  caps, or did you write in all caps ever since a kid? 
[03:26:00]  No.  I wrote in cursive...  I can't even remember when I was taught.  Stephanie, can I ask you a question?  Because I'm kind of learning about this.  Do you have big, thick periods?  No.  No.  I'm just asking because I'm learning a lot about this.  But, Stephanie, if I were you, think back of when you started, and if you were going  through something in your life, and writing in all caps doesn't mean that you will distance 
[03:26:30]  yourself a little bit emotionally and try to think, okay, better do it all logically  because I can't get my emotions that involved in this.  So, think about that when you're writing, when it started, what may have started.  All right.  Let's go to Kenny in Jersey.  Kenny, you're on.  Hi.  Michelle.  Hey, Kenny.  Hi.  I mix capital E's and lowercase E's.  You mean like...  What do you mean?  You have a capital E's, like if you write the word ever, it could be a small E, V, a big 
[03:27:00]  E, and an R?  Is that what you're saying?  Like Kenneth.  In your name.  So, really, if you mix capitals where they don't belong, it can mean you're a little  bit unpredictable.  Here and there, it doesn't mean that much.  But, ideally, if your letters that should be lowercase turn into capitals in an erratic  way, it can mean that sometimes you do things that are a little unpredictable, even sometimes 
[03:27:30]  to yourself.  So, ideally, you don't want to do that where they don't belong, but a little bit here and  there doesn't mean all that much.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you, Kenneth.  My friend, Steve, likes to print the capital letters because he's unpredictable.  All right.  I don't know who this person is.  You're on with Michelle.  Hi.  Good evening.  Are you there, sir?  I'm here.  Oh.  Madam.  Madam, what's up?  Hi. 
[03:28:00]  Hello?  Hello.  Hi.  Dan.  Hello?  Yeah, you.  You're up.  Go.  You're up.  Oh, hey.  I'm sorry.  I was wondering, my big P, the top of it gets, it's a lot larger than the rest of it,  like the long, skinny part.  I was wondering what that meant.  Oh, that's a very good question.  The top part of the letter P is very rounded and big, and then you just have a little P  line.  Yeah, only on my big P, though.  Okay.  Well, let's see what we can say what that means. 
[03:28:30]  Well, it just means you have a big P.  Yeah.  It does mean sometimes you like to please others, and there's a big desire to please.  Yeah.  And sometimes when I write my V, the tip of it, it's real skinny and tighter than the  top part of it.  I was wondering, it's like a very big difference.  It's almost like a sharp wedge.  Yeah.  That in itself doesn't mean that much. 
[03:29:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Does it mean anything if every time you write a V, the scrumorstrum?  I hope not.  All right.  Let's say hi to David in Washington.  We're wrapping up with Michelle here, but David has something.  Hello.  Yeah.  Okay.  Seriously, my handwriting is super neat.  It looks like the letters were typed, practically.  Okay.  My A's, I make my A's the way they would appear.  My lowercase A's, like on a typewriter.  Ooh.  Okay.  And sometimes I make my G's that way, too, with the little loopy feel. 
[03:29:30]  And when I'm writing handwriting, the paper, I turn it to where it's like I'm writing vertically.  Yeah, I've seen those weirdos in school.  Well, you know what that means?  Your hearing looks real perfect.  Is that what you're telling me?  It is really close to perfect.  It means you're a braggart.  Yeah.  No, you know what that means?  When somebody, people tell me, oh, look, this person there has real perfect neat handwriting.  Isn't that great?  When you write so it's so perfect that it's unnatural, it means that you can't relax and you're so afraid to show who you really are that you need so desperately to keep everything perfect and in place because you don't want anyone really to see what's inside. 
[03:30:00]  And it's very hard to be spontaneous because if you're spontaneous, people might go, oh, look, you did something wrong.  So you're keeping everything in extreme order so not to give anybody the impression that you have any flaws.  Yeah.  It's kind of a fear factor. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, but I write, like, really messy and I can't relax.  It's just the opposite.  Well, it may be different.  You may not put up, like, a front that I'm perfect.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Well, I can.  You certainly don't.  That's true.  So that's different.  He knows that he has no problem with it.  It means that they're trying so hard not to let anybody see any of their problems.  Yeah.  All right.  What if I write fine, but I have a messy colon? 
[03:31:00]  Well, I guess you have to go to the doctor.  I have a question.  Danny just threw away his paper.  You didn't write this alone.  Who did you write this book with?  I wrote Sex, Lives, and Handwriting with someone named James Kwalwasser, who's a very good editor and writer.  Oh, okay.  I thought James Kwalwasser was a handwriting expert.  Yeah.  No, he's not a handwriting expert.  He's an editor.  A ghost writer.  You didn't write.  No.  Hey, John in Jersey has a very good question for you, Michelle. 
[03:31:30]  Yes, John, you're up.  Yes, I'd like to wonder why my D's go with my A.  What's that, John?  He wants to know why.  They go with my A.  I'm sorry.  If you could please repeat what you said, that might help.  Yes, my D's go into my A, my right.  Oh, yeah.  The D's go to the right?  They go into the A's.  They go into his A's.  Yeah, if he has an A, the D goes right into it.  Okay, so your letters are intersecting with each other. 
[03:32:00]  Is that what you're telling me?  Yes.  At least the D's and the A's, yeah.  Ideally, you don't want your letters intersecting like that.  You know, it's a little hard to know.  Ideally, you want your letters separate.  If it's your everyday letters other than signatures, signatures mean something a little different.  But your letters intersecting mean that there are things that are getting kind of mixed up in your life.  Ideally, you want to keep your letters not from intersecting and not from going overlapping like that. 
[03:32:30]  Wait, what does it mean?  Just like God said.  What does it mean?  If you're signing a J, right?  What does it mean if you sign a J in cursive and the top of the J is really big and round, but the small part of the J, the lower part, the looping part of the J is very small and tight at the bottom.  Most people who write a very big J, a very rounded top part of a J, that usually shows responsibility.  And what is the lower part?  Of no lower loop, it means they're not too much into the sex part. 
[03:33:00]  Aw, responsible and no sex.  The people that mix cursive with print.  Cursive with print.  If you do cursive with printing in a way that is efficient, it means you're exceptionally bright and creative.  You'll find people who are musicians, artists, speakers, who are creative and bright.  They do this form of print writing where they actually combine printing and cursive. 
[03:33:30]  And you'll find that in a very creative, bright people's handwriting.  I think I do that!  Oh, good.  It's a very good sign.  Oh, that's good.  Yes.  What about those dopey girls with the hearts over the eyes and stuff?  Yeah, what does that mean when bitches do that?  It means something different than if it's a boy who does it.  What does it mean?  Oh, what if a boy does it?  You know, usually people who do a little heart, they're almost always teenagers. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Right!  And it's just, it's somebody obvious, it's like pretty obvious what it means.  It's, um, if it's a teenage girl, it means, hi, I feel romantic.  Oh, you know.  Can I go in your jacuzzi?  Yeah, it's kind of.  And it's got a heart over it.  Yeah.  It's something that does that when they get older, though.  It means that it can be kind of immature or a little too romantic.  And that means I'm coming over to burn some clothes.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess it all depends on the person doing it.  Is that what you're trying to tell me? 
[03:34:30]  Your turn.  Well, it depends on their age, too.  Yeah.  How about they, you talk.  For somebody 15 and they're not appropriate for somebody older than that.  Right.  People sometimes do the circle eye dots, too.  A lot of people do that.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, uh, well, the X is a great call.  It's a very interesting.  Where are you based out of, sweetie?  Where am I based out of?  I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Oh.  Oh, cool.  Well, it's been nice talking to you.  Yeah.  When are you going to make it to the big time and get out of that hellhole?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm trying. 
[03:35:00]  I'm trying.  If everybody out there buys Sex, Lies, and Handwriting, I could get out of Pittsburgh.  Oh, that would rock, right?  That would rock.  Where are you going to move to?  Oh, I don't know.  If I had my choice to move anywhere in the world, I think I'd go to some Caribbean.  I don't know.  I might go to an island right now and just snorkel every day and take some time off and  just relax for a little bit.  All wrinkly.  Snorkel every day.  Yeesh.  All right.  Thank you for the help.  I might go up to New York City. 
[03:35:30]  All right.  There you go.  You were very nice.  Well, thank you.  It was such a pleasure to talk to you.  Thank you so much.  Sex, Lies, and Handwriting.  I got to say, at first, like Opie said, I saw this book and it didn't hold much interest.  No.  Now I'm going to read it.  Now that I'm just talking to you, I really do want to read this.  Oh, great.  You know what?  I tried to do it in a really fun way.  So it's not real technical, but you do learn a lot.  And I just wanted it to be a really fun book.  So I think you'd enjoy Sex, Lies, and Handwriting.  And I thank you so much.  Thank you, Michelle. 
[03:36:00]  Thank you, Michelle.  Book held up better than that bro book did.  That's for sure.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Thank you.  There she goes.  And I have a big P in me, too.  Michelle Dressbold.  David's been chiming in a lot.  I love it.  Yeah.  David's hysterical.  He'll just, ah-ha, yeah.  What did he laugh at with E-Rock before?  I don't know.  The zero with the line through him or something?  Yeah.  I'll see you guys later.  He threw in a little E-Rock, a little crack at E-Rock, too.  What are you looking for?  What are you doing, Reg?  What are you doing?  Your teeth?  The big goodbye.  Scram.  Are you doing your teeth? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, I'm doing your teeth.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Are you going to, like, we're going to videotape you doing some of your comedy without teeth?  If I remember.  Yeah, I'll do some comedy without teeth.  All right.  Good luck to you, buddy.  Thanks.  All right.  Good luck, Voss.  Come back.  What is this guy?  Fuck.  Don't, you're not allowed to talk to me.  David's hysterical.  Good luck, Voss.  I know.  Well, David's right.  David fucking is wishing Voss good luck.  Right at all.  Yes, I am.  Thank you.  You wouldn't have good luck if it wasn't for my David.  We love David.  David's a good boy.  Yes.  David's a good egg.  The JJ is all right. 
[03:37:00]  David's a fucking, uh, David's a mensch.  All right.  David, why don't you get up and leave?  He's Voss slamming the door.  Become an intern again.  All right.  Good job, David.  There he goes.  Good job today, David.  Yeah.  You feeling satisfied with your performance?  Definitely.  Were there any parts that you wished for better?  I don't know.  I'm not today.  Yeah, you have that, uh, handwriting analysis.  It was pretty good, huh?  Spot on.  Yeah, she was perfect.  She got it right on.  Very good.  Did they think you were slow when you were a kid?  They thought so. 
[03:37:30]  Aw.  Aw.  I thought so, yeah.  But they know you're not now, right?  They know.  They know.  All right, David.  Filled our quota of certain jokes, which was good.  We really did.  There were some good ones in there.  Our daily quota of horrific jokes.  That's telling you.  Big sloppy period was great.  All right, David.  Okay, David.  Jesus.  Thank you.  All right, David.  That's horrible.  Just awful people.  It's just perfect as a joke.  It's completely unnecessary.  Of course it is.  On a daily basis. 
[03:38:00]  It's brutal.  For no reason.  Oh, God.  All right, here we go.  Why don't we do Line of the Day and get the footage out of heat?  That's right.  Line of the Day is brought to you by WebEx.com.  By the way, Voss is going to be...  We've got to give him the plug.  Yes.  Funny Bone, Virginia.  Virginia.  Virginia Beach.  Voss, what's the plug?  Oh, uh...  Anyway, tell Poe to grab my truck.  Thanks.  Virginia Beach this weekend, but I forgot.  Right.  Next weekend up in Boston at Dick's Beantown Comedy Vault in Boston next weekend.  Halloween weekend.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[03:38:30]  I wouldn't...  Voss will go dressed as a dummy.  Oh, please.  Just kidding.  All right.  Thanks, you guys.  All right.  The Virginia Beach.  When are you going to be there?  I'll be there on Wednesday through Sunday, this week.  All right.  Funny Bone.  Funny Bone.  See you later.  All right, man.  Good luck, buddy.  Webex.com.  Hold meetings, make presentations, do it from the comfort of your own home or office.  Check it out at Webex.com.  One of many runner-up lines of the day.  Brother got MRSA from sharing tattoo ointment.  Friend got MRSA from karate or had MRSA on my back.  We take one more. 
[03:39:00]  MRSA Poe.  That's hilarious.  Karate.  We talked about that today?  That seems like yesterday, right?  Another runner-up line of the day.  Don't ever use chick lit on our show again.  I can't believe you haven't heard that.  I read the one about ex-wives, the secret life of C's.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Is it weird? 
[03:39:30]  Is this weird?  Somebody told me that I make the letter I, I make huge.  Like when I'm writing I, and somebody says because my penis is large.  I think that's the reason.  All right, it goes right along with you, Jimmy.  This is great.  You hear David?  You hear JJ.  JJ.  He was just so thrilled with that joke.  Oh, David fucking tickled him pink.  Boys, she had a hot voice, huh? 
[03:40:00]  A lot of people noticing the hot voice on that.  Can we get a picture of her, Dan?  Well, she has a hot voice, Jimmy.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  Another one.  Is she a fatty?  No.  Is it true that Olivia Newton's John's W's look like U's?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  That one I don't know.  Wow.  Hey, what does it mean if you sign stuff with just, if you just sign your last name?  You'll hear her laughter in the background for the next ten minutes, by the way.  I just want to acknowledge that. 
[03:40:30]  But if you...  Olivia's Newton's John.  I didn't even notice.  W's or a U.  God damn, does that work out?  The line was so good, it doesn't matter.  Oh, thank you.  As soon as her name came up, I knew what the point of the joke would be.  I'm like, how are we going to get there today?  What barbaric route are we going to take to get there today?  What are we doing now? 
[03:41:00]  One more runner-up.  Somebody's using them as pillows right now.  He tiles on his shuttle.  See, that's the joke, Rich.  What?  He tiles on the shuttle, not pillows.  Who would want to lie in a hard pillow like that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's just defeated again.  It's not whatever.  I don't know.  Good God.  Here's your line of the day.  Ooh. 
[03:41:30]  Here comes line of the day.  Line of the day.  Some backup vocals.  What was your name?  Tyne Daly.  Tyne Daly.  Oh, damn.  I still laugh at that.  When the hell was that?  Is that recent?  Must have been hilarious.  In jail.  Good point.  Who are you a love interest for? 
[03:42:00]  There's a little improv stand-up for you.  For you.  I think line of the day, though, should have been, you want to ask him a question?  Yeah.  Who are you?  Who are you?  That was strong.  Who are you?  LiveNation.com for Cheech and John.  Cheech and John.  Cheech and John.  Cheech and John.  I hope it doesn't work.  John is dead, so he's cheating John.  Hi-ya.  It was fun, man.  God, we had Jocktober.  We have some great Jocktober stuff to get to tomorrow.  Yes.  Jimmy's book, I Hate Your Guts.  We got one of the first few copies today. 
[03:42:30]  No, you got the first ones.  The first ones?  Yes.  I had one copy sent to me at the end of last week, and then those are the first ones I  got for you guys.  I'll have this read by Friday.  Now, Jimmy, the one thing.  They can pre-order on Amazon?  They can, yes.  Why is Aunt Nye's thank you below the thank you for your mom, dad, sister, and nephew?  Because what happened was they tend to complain, because originally I had you guys first, and 
[03:43:00]  I had them actually blow Club Soda Kenny.  You had them blow Club Soda Kenny?  No, they did that voluntarily.  It was below.  Below?  Oh, okay.  Kenny likes sloppy party bottoms.  So I told my family to fucking get on their stomachs, open their buttcheats up, and let  old fucking John Kenneth in there with his rod.  They knew better than arguing.  John Kenneth.  And so I had to put them first.  It was simply polite.  Very disappointed you started your thank yous with your mom and dad. 
[03:43:30]  Very disappointed.  Yeah, but it wasn't the way I wanted it to go down.  I'm just fucking kidding.  Oh, I was right.  I was just fucking kidding.  Jim Norton, I hate your guts.  The book looks like it's going to be just as good, if not better, than Happy Endings.  Thank you.  It's definitely a different challenge, Joe.  And I liked Happy Endings a lot.  Definitely different.  A completely different direction.  Yeah.  I think you're going to have people talking about this book in the media.  I hope so, man.  Bash a lot of people.  We do everything else we need to do?  Oh, a Cheech and Chong ID.  They did a pretty good job on, I heard.  Oh, they're probably following the super fly, I'm thinking. 
[03:44:00]  E-Rock brought in the ID, so there's got to be something here with this Cheech and Chong.  Let me see what it does.  Hi, Roland.  Hey, this is Cheech.  And this is Chong.  And you're listening to...  Anthony Opie and...  One more.  Hey, this is Cheech.  And this is Chong.  And you're listening to...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So listen up.  But I can't tell those guys apart, can you?  One guy's...  No, they're both white.  Okay.  That's good.  A little racially insensitive.  Yeah, I'm not happy about that. 
[03:44:30]  See you tomorrow. </pre>
