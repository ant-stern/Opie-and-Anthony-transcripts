<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton introducing themselves with characteristic vulgar humor and acknowledging their history of controversy and FCC violations.  Their show's content, they joked, revolved around "cock or balls."  The conversation began with a discussion of a recent snowstorm, which segued into a profane debate about climate change and its shifting terminology, punctuated by cynical observations about the vast emptiness of much of the Earth, using Australia as an example.  They then mocked a news report about malfunctioning Metro North train doors, which led to a scathing critique of Barack Obama's State of the Union address.  Anthony's comments were particularly harsh, filled with crude and offensive remarks about Obama's policies, personal life, and Michelle Obama's appearance. The empty seat reserved for Gabrielle Giffords prompted jokes about uninvited guests, and a digression about bribing ushers for better seats.

The critique of Obama's speech continued, focusing on clean energy initiatives, NASA funding, and the perceived lack of accountability in politics, with Obama and Hillary Clinton used as examples.  The Tucson shooting and subsequent gun control debate were mentioned, alongside criticisms of the media's coverage and discussion of Gabrielle Giffords' recovery.  Further criticism of Obama's policies, regarding tax cuts, education, and the acceptance of gay people in the military, followed.  Listener calls interspersed throughout included one criticizing Anthony's negativity, a caller sharing a seat-bribing anecdote, and a military lawyer defending the inclusion of gay people in the military based on competence.  The segment ended with continued vulgar commentary on Obama's policies and the hosts' overall dissatisfaction with the state of the nation.

The show then moved on to a discussion about allowing openly gay individuals in the military,  featuring numerous homophobic remarks from both the hosts and callers. A caller shared an anecdote about his father's outdated views.  The conversation switched to a proposed New York State law banning pedestrian phone use, which the hosts ridiculed as a revenue-generating measure.  Callers shared their experiences with similar laws.  A news story about a handcuffed woman escaping a police car led to more caller anecdotes and humorous tangents about police interactions and absurd laws.  Big A, a regular contributor, delivered a comedic, poorly written news report.

A guest appearance by comedian Tom Papa followed.  They discussed Papa's career, contrasting it with their own, along with a comedy benefit, property taxes, and absurd laws, referencing a website showcasing unusual legislation.  This segment also mentioned Olivia Munn and Jerry Springer as upcoming guests.

The next segment focused on past guests, particularly Tracy Morgan, Ricky Gervais, and Colin Quinn.  They discussed Morgan's unpredictable style, Gervais's intoxication during his appearance, and Colin Quinn's Broadway show, including darkly humorous speculations about Quinn's potential death.  A lengthy, vulgar comparison of Quinn's career to Peter Scolari's followed, including speculation about Scolari's involvement in a male enhancement commercial.  Jerry Springer then joined the show, and they discussed his show's impact, shocking content, and his career, including *America's Got Talent* and his Broadway role.  Tom Papa's involvement in the upcoming comedy benefit was again mentioned.

Jerry Springer continued as a guest, discussing the guest selection process for his show, humorous anecdotes about past shows, and his even-keeled approach to the outrageous content.  He discussed his career, including *America's Got Talent*.  Olivia Munn then joined, and the conversation shifted to her Maxim cover, photoshopping, and her career.  Lighthearted banter ensued, touching on her personal life, dating, social anxieties, and panic attacks.  Tom Papa left as Munn arrived.  The conversation ended with further discussion of Munn's anxieties.

A final segment featured Olivia Munn discussing her "super sensitive" state, followed by a discussion of Opie's recent car accident involving his Shelby Super Snake Mustang.  Munn promoted her projects, including *Perfect Couples* and the Maxim photoshoot, before thanking the hosts and leaving the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go, here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its 
[00:00:30]  cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show  suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls. 
[00:01:00]  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Damn.  Thank you, Stacey Keats.  We won't let you down.  Or will we?  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Another fucking snowstorm heading our way, huh?  This is one of those real winters they talk about.  What's the matter, Danny?  Oh, I think the computer was fucking up again.  Wow.  He hit his thing after the computer was messing up.  I was so happy.  Bang.  Another storm rolling through.  Real winter for the Northeast.  It's been quite a while.  I remember when I was a kid, used to have a lot of these storms, snow piling up.  You go out in your little snow suit.  It's up to your head.  And the snow lasted the whole winter.  That's right.  And this seems to be what we're on track for. 
[00:02:00]  Snow's been on the ground now since the first time it snowed.  For a while.  And it just hasn't stopped.  I'm waiting for my pool cover to fall into my pool.  Is this global warming?  What do we got going on here?  Because Canada is unusually warm this winter.  Well, that's odd.  Which is fucked up because they're above us.  Yeah, they're the ones that are supposed to, their cold air comes down here and fucks us up.  They're way up there.  They're up.  They're up.  They're up at the ceiling.  Yeah, that's where they are, though.  Yeah.  And then they're getting snow down in the south. 
[00:02:30]  So what the fuck's going on?  Canada's supposed to be real cold.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  I like their global warming cop-out because when the temperatures were kind of ticking up  and we were getting these unusually warm winters and whatnot,  people were like, hey, global warming, we're ruining the globe.  This sucks.  This sucks.  And then after the first few years lately that we've been getting colder winters with more snow,  they changed their whole thing and went, well, global warming doesn't necessarily mean warming.  We changed the name of it now to climate change because it can mean that it's going to get cold. 
[00:03:00]  Well, that makes sense.  Yeah, it makes sense when it starts getting cold and they were calling it global warming to change the fucking name.  A rose by any other name still is a bunch of bullshit.  I think we're fucking up the planet somehow.  Yeah, we've got to be, but we're natural occurrences on this globe.  I think we're messing with the weather a little bit.  Yeah.  I really do.  But bugs do.  Like animals do.  We're just another animal that's fucking with the planet, but the planet's fine.  The planet's fine. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, there is a fuckload of planets where nothing is happening.  You ever see the Earth from space?  No.  Oh, it's beautiful.  I've never been up there.  I went up there once on an acid trip.  Yeah, I never really saw it that way.  I've seen some satellite pictures.  And you look down, and it doesn't look like the Borg planet.  There's not like lights and speckles all over the place of light.  The most part, you look and go, there's nobody there.  There's just nobody home.  Yeah, that's because the pictures were taken at night. 
[00:04:00]  Oh.  Everyone's lights were out.  Oh, right?  They were sleeping.  They were snoozing.  They were snoozing.  They're snoozing.  I'm snoozing.  Yeah, I would like to think there's not a lot of people around, but fuck.  I live in Manhattan.  Yeah, well, that's one of the concentrated areas.  At any second, you're going to punch someone in the face if there's so many people around.  That is true.  Doing stupid shit.  This is true.  Look at Australia.  I mean, that place has got nothing.  A couple of cities, and then the rest is nada.  Where is Australia?  On that map.  Oh, it's that big thing.  And look how big Australia is. 
[00:04:30]  Now, go to the right and look at the ocean.  That's a little piece of an ocean of the South Pacific, and it's like 10 Australias.  And it's just, yeah, and it's just a little piece of the South Pacific.  There is nothing.  We could fish the shit out of things.  We could drill oil.  We could bellow fucking smoke into the atmosphere.  They're saying we can't fish.  Oh, look at the size of the ocean.  Imagine trying to catch every human being on a hook.  There's more fish.  We're starting to eat ugly-looking fish that taste bad because we've overfished the waters. 
[00:05:00]  That's a fact.  Remember a date?  It's eating an ugly fish.  Get it?  She smelled bad and looked bad.  That's a good one.  I thought it was an A.P. Vigoda reference.  But it's like there's so much ocean out there.  Oh, boy.  Here's your video of the day.  Video shows doors stuck open on speeding Metro North trains.  So what's going to happen?  Everyone just stay away from the door. 
[00:05:30]  Stay away from the door.  They'll fix it at the next station.  Let's all relax.  Yeah.  I bet it was cold, though.  But this guy.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I think those people are idiots who are standing right by the door, but that's really unsafe.  Should they have stopped the train?  I mean, should they have notified somebody?  What do you make of it?  Absolutely.  They should have notified somebody.  I mean, that's something that requires somebody to go ahead and put them in a suit.  They'll press the alarm and make sure that anybody can die.  What happens if they die?  They're going to say, oh, I'm sorry.  Eventually, the door closes on its own with a little push from the passenger. 
[00:06:00]  Metro North actually says the video disturbs them, too,  and they're investigating the malfunction,  which a railroad union official blames on a frozen circuit that controls the doors  and should have also alerted a conductor.  A spokesman says all doors are now being inspected,  and this 40-year-old car is out of service for repairs.  Is there anything more tattletale than this?  Who gives a shit?  So, lessons to be learned from this.  Well, first of all, never lean on a moving train door for this very reason. 
[00:06:30]  And also, Metro North says if you ever see a door open with the train running,  move much further away from it than you see passengers in that video doing.  I thought you'd move closer to it, you stupid bitch.  And by all means, call over a conductor.  They can close it manually.  But one rider on this train told us that a conductor was told and never came back there.  Metro North says this is a very unusual occurrence.  Unusual.  They claim that no conductor was ever told.  Right.  That's the latest this morning.  And then they ask for more money. 
[00:07:00]  Is that news?  A door got stuck open on the train.  Right.  Someone filmed it, so they show people.  This is how they created that story.  They show people outside and ask them to comment.  What are people going to say?  No, no, it's good the door's open.  Great the door's open.  We want more doors open.  And then some dumb advice.  Make sure you move away from the open door.  Really?  They've got to give you the safety.  I didn't know you were supposed to do that.  Got to give you the safety advice for the story.  The news just sucks.  It's so bad.  And what we can learn from this, don't lean up against doors, really? 
[00:07:30]  You could spend the next 20 years of your life leaning up against a door, and guess what?  Nothing.  You'll be completely fine.  It's one of those rare fucking things that happens.  Ugh.  Stupid fucking news.  News is asinine.  You guys watched the Obama?  I watched some Obama State of the Union address.  Let me guess.  You hated it.  No.  Actually.  Actually.  Let me guess.  I thought the lighting was very good. 
[00:08:00]  Let me guess.  And the sound quality.  Let me guess.  You were screaming at your TV.  I was at the part where, you know, I had to reiterate that the tax cuts are temporary  and that millionaires should do their part.  It's like, you know, fucking, how about you cut everything?  Just cut all your fucking pocket-stuffing bullshit with your cronyism.  Yeah, how about you and your family stop taking fucking $800,000 vacations?  Yeah.  I know all presidents take them.  How about we save it that way?  But if everyone's making big sacrifices, how about you start, and maybe Michelle doesn't 
[00:08:30]  go over to Europe with her friends and a fucking full contingent of bodyguards?  And you don't have giant cotillions at the White House with international dignitaries  eating, uh, drinking champagne, champagne cocktails high in the Sierra Mountains.  So, I guess you didn't like it.  No, I hated it.  Of course you did.  I know.  Did you hate it as soon as you saw Michelle Obama?  Even though she didn't do anything but walk in?  That woman's got some shoulders on her.  She's got big hips.  She's a big woman.  She's got the big hips. 
[00:09:00]  She is a big, big woman.  She's got the big hips where you know she's wearing stretchy underwear.  She's got to be.  Sexy, though.  She goes with the sexy.  But aren't they too big?  You ever see sexy underwear that's much too big?  Well, they're stretching too far on the sides.  It's like...  I've always hated that.  You're looking at stores, I mean, you're walking down the foundations aisle, and you  see the supposed sexy underwear, but it's much too big.  You know what I liked about the State of the Union, and this is as far as I got into 
[00:09:30]  it?  The empty seat.  Very emotional.  That's, uh...  For the Giffords.  It's like the missing man formation, uh...  Very emotional.  Fighter pilots.  Some asshole had to fucking stand somewhere, because, uh, they had to have an empty seat  to get...  Empty seat.  ...to get us all emotional.  That's so he could turn and say, and we should be conscious of the empty seat here tonight.  And, uh...  You know, he wanted to stay.  I would have been the asshole.  Is that seat taken?  Yeah, is that...  Yeah, imagine some dummy just...  Is that seat taken?  ...goes, there's an empty seat.  I'm moving up.  Walking down the aisle.  He sits down. 
[00:10:00]  Is that...  I...  That empty seat...  Just be clueless guy.  He's eating a sundae like George Costanza at the game.  He's got chocolate all over his face.  Is that...  I think that's an empty seat.  I'm moving down.  I'm moving down.  Dude, I'm moving down.  I hope the usher doesn't notice.  Fucking ushers, go fuck yourselves.  I'm going to give out a lot of fuck yous today.  Oh.  Stupid fucking ushers at sporting events looking for a handout when you see an empty seat below.  Are you kidding?  They look to get paid off?  You don't know that?  No.  I actually didn't know that.  You don't know that?  No.  I did not. 
[00:10:30]  No, I really didn't.  Is that commonplace?  Yeah.  It's common in New York.  These guys watch their seats like fucking hawks, and if you try to move down, they go,  Hey, you can't sit there.  Oh, but you give them a five spot, they'll let you sit there.  Wow.  Really?  Probably more than five at this point.  Yeah.  You don't know that?  No.  Dude, I swear to God.  These guys fucking...  I don't know how to bribe people.  I've never known how to do it.  They watch their areas.  As soon as you move down, they know, and they come running.  They come running.  I would be so afraid of getting thrown out.  I don't know.  Who...  Jimmy just goes, Thought we could take care of it right here at the garden. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's my ticket.  I don't have my ticket.  Dude, I had no idea that you could bribe your way.  That's great.  And you're supposed to tip them when they show you your seat, even though you sit there  for every fucking day.  Oh, really?  I don't tip.  They have a weird, dirty rag, and they kind of make believe they're brushing your seat  off for you.  And then, if you don't tip, you hear them go, Fuck yourself.  I tip, by the way.  Some jobs dictate you tip, some don't. 
[00:11:30]  But you don't really...  I don't think it's necessary.  No?  But, man, yeah.  You try to move down, and they're fucking looking for their hand out.  You want to go through the State of the Union?  Of course.  It was the big story last night.  The president...  Not the big story in my household.  On the heels of the Tucson shooting coming out, State of the Union address, and a very...  You know, people were very upset about, a lot of liberals, that he didn't bring up  gun control.  Oh.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.  Well, because he knows what happens. 
[00:12:00]  He loses even more people from the House and the Senate.  After watching the way the media tried to pass off this guy's shooting on Sarah Payne,  Dylan's metaphorical target.  Like, I have such a fucking disdain for them, and they really have kept their mouth shut.  It's funny how they have not continued.  Where's the rhetoric talk?  Yeah, where is it?  Where's all the media with the rhetoric talk that it turns out that he was a fucking left-wing  radical?  Which, again, it's not their fault that he did it. 
[00:12:30]  But where is it?  Yeah, come on.  Where the fuck is the media yapping now that he...  His friends even said he didn't like bullshit.  He didn't like right-wing talk radio.  Or even admitting that, you know, perhaps some of the reporting was a little...  Biased.  ...biased and wrong.  But no, you'll never see that.  The story disappeared.  All of a sudden, it's not Sarah Payne anymore, but no one will say it.  And this guy's there grinning in a courtroom like a lunatic.  And...  But he's nuts.  He is crazy.  This guy is batshit nuts.  He's just nuts.  There's no looking for answers. 
[00:13:00]  He's just a crazy mother.  No.  We love answers.  Sometimes there isn't one.  He's nuts.  He's just a crazy person.  He's a nut.  And Gifford's condition has been upgraded to good from Sirius.  Yeah.  She's going to rehab and stuff.  This broad's going to be playing tennis soon, man.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Good to Sirius.  I mean, she's coming to work here at Sirius XM.  No, Chip, she's not.  Although, who knows?  I know.  They'll probably give her a show.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I just had a few titles go through my head, and I filtered it. 
[00:13:30]  See, this is how the O.B. and Anthony Show filter works.  You get a thought in your head, and before you spit it out, 99% of the times we filter  it so we don't get in trouble.  1% of the time it slips out, we get in trouble.  But that time right there, I thought better than to make a joke about her condition and  this place.  No way.  I had no desire to do that or to say how this should probably be perfect in a management  level position.  Okay.  Well, that's funny because scooping on the management.  Yeah.  I was not going to say that at all.  Yes. 
[00:14:00]  Obama, State of the Union.  Obama.  A couple highlights for everybody.  We're telling America's scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds  in their fields and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we'll fund the Apollo projects  of our time.  At the California Institute of Technology, they're developing a way to turn sunlight and water  into fuel for our cars.  Yeah.  Hydrogen.  At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they're using supercomputers to get a lot more power 
[00:14:30]  out of our nuclear facilities.  Supercomputers.  With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuel.  How does he not know if they're using supercomputers?  Someone has to tell him before he makes that speech.  I know.  He doesn't know the difference whether they're using supercomputers to get a...  Supercomputers.  Supercomputers.  They're using supercomputers.  One of those two.  Well, soup is very delicious.  And the Apollo project.  It's all about black people, isn't it?  That line kind of pissed me off because he's the guy that pretty much put the kibosh on 
[00:15:00]  the back to the moon project, which people would go, oh, well, that's another expense.  It's a lot of money.  Bloody, bloody, blah.  But do you know how much technology and jobs and new technology and things he's talking  about here?  He's talking about the next Apollo project.  Well, that is where a lot of technology that this country was famous for making came from,  the space program.  And he's decimating it in order to give money I don't know where else and tax the fuck out 
[00:15:30]  of everybody, yet no money goes to these programs that do make jobs and do make technology and  innovation so we can have jobs here in this country and invent things again like we did  during the Apollo program.  So he evokes the name of the Apollo program, and yet what he's doing is tearing apart NASA  and pretty much restricting them to having to take Russian ships up to the space station 
[00:16:00]  because we now don't have a space program.  Maybe he just thinks it's a waste of time and there's no more new technology to be had.  Well, maybe, but they thought that, too, back in the 60s.  Oh, I understand.  You can't be open-minded.  We will go to the moon and do those other things.  I love when he goes to those other things.  What was that?  Keep your head on?  Oops, that other thing didn't quite work.  Going backwards, Rob in Garden City.  Rob.  Yeah, when I was a kid, me and my father would go to Shea Stadium, and he knew we'd buy the 
[00:16:30]  cheapest tickets, like $10 tickets, and he would go to a certain gate, and he would just  hand the guy $50, and we would just be able to sit down like three rows behind a third-base  dugout, and he knew what seats, like, never got used, and if by any chance they would happen  to show up, he'd just move us to an own seat.  Now, $50, but the usher would move you?  Yeah, just the guy that's in that area, that seats you.  Actually, the musician usher.  And if you pay the usher, then they would take care of you and make sure they would move 
[00:17:00]  you around if the seat they put you in, if the guy showed up.  $50.  Now, what year was that, though?  That sounds more like it.  What year was that?  That was, like, in the mid, like, maybe late 90s.  It's a major scam, especially at baseball games.  Major.  There's so many.  You're not just moving down for free.  There's no way you could get away with it.  Wow.  I didn't know you could do it at all, though, dude.  That's great news.  Oh.  I got to sit right behind, like, right on the third-base dugout, like, setting my drinks 
[00:17:30]  and food right on the dugout.  Wow.  For, like, $10.  Those are great seats when you can put your beer on the dugout.  I've only had that seat once, and it's such a great place.  Great fucking seat, man.  Yeah, it really is.  Put your beer down.  Yeah, lean on the dugout.  Wave.  All right, sir.  Back to the State of the Union.  Oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road  by 2015.  Wow. 
[00:18:00]  We need to get behind this innovation.  And to help pay for it, I'm asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars  we currently give to oil companies.  I'm fine with that, though.  I don't know if you've noticed, but they're doing just fine on their own.  Oh, shit.  A little joke.  A little Obama joke. 
[00:18:30]  I agree with that, though.  Like, fucking put the money into alternative energy instead of giving billions.  I don't want my tax dollars going to the oil companies.  He could ask all he wants.  It's not going to happen.  I don't know what kind of tax breaks the oil companies are getting, what it's being used  for.  I know the oil companies don't just pump oil out and make money all the time.  They're doing very well right now, that's for sure.  But research and development is a huge part of oil companies.  It is.  They can't just keep pumping the same fucking wells. 
[00:19:00]  And we run right now, unfortunately, we still run on fossil fuel until that runs out  and we've got to come up with something different.  Obama wants a million electric cars on the road.  Where does the electricity come from?  Do people understand we don't pull it out of our assholes that it comes from fucking  oil pumping fucking electricity?  Yeah, there's nuclear power plants, too, and stuff.  But for the most part, it comes from fucking, from generators powered by fossil fuel.  But we don't use as much oil that way, right? 
[00:19:30]  Is that...  Well, not as much as I would guess the olden days when we didn't have nuclear power plants.  I like the electric car thing, but I bet you if we grab some audio from Jimmy Carter,  he probably said the same thing in the 70s.  We should do a montage of State of the Union promises.  George W. Bush was saying the same fucking speech.  And I'm sure Clinton said it.  About technology and how we need to.  I'm sure the other Bush said it.  Why does it not get done, though?  Like, I know it's a haul, but like, literally, we can have... 
[00:20:00]  Like, I think a lot of the cabs you take now, because it saves them on gas, are hybrids,  and they're fucking...  They always think they're running out of...  They're off.  Yeah.  They're so quiet.  Yeah.  But why don't we have that?  The oil companies really do invest in and lobby against that shit, and that's where you  got to kind of hate them.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's a business.  If you were...  No, I know.  If you were putting out something, if there was all of a sudden this solar-paneled, hysterical  comedian that came rolling out onto a stage and made people laugh and laugh, and the club 
[00:20:30]  owners didn't have to pay him a fucking...  Paid him a buck every time they came out on stage, and they started going, Jimmy, you  know, these guys are funny, these robot things, we pay him a buck.  You'd be going like, I don't like these robot comedians.  You're right.  And I would be selfish about it, especially if most of my audience is what kept this country  tied into these shit-made countries, like fucking Saudi Arabia.  Especially if my audience was dependent on Saudi Arabia, then I would be selfish, but 
[00:21:00]  boy, would I be a selfish cunt.  I hate the fucking Middle East, and I want out.  With a passion.  I want out.  I don't care what they do to each other.  Yeah, I know.  I agree.  I'm sick of depending on them.  Carolina man, ope, and hates entitlements, and NASA has never done anything but lost  billions of dollars since the mid-80s.  You know what?  And that's probably what Obama's looking at.  But losing, then restructure, but losing money, you don't lose money when you invent 
[00:21:30]  things.  Let's see what NASA has come up with that we use on a daily basis since the 80s till now,  and you tell me that's losing money.  It makes industry.  If a company, if a government agency, and by the way, show me one government agency that  makes fucking money, okay?  It doesn't happen.  NASA is an innovative government agency.  They have great minds, and over the history of NASA, they've had their ups and downs, but 
[00:22:00]  for the most part, they have invented amazing fucking things.  Why don't we privatize?  Privatizing things.  Yeah, privatize.  Why don't we privatize the space program?  How about restructuring and just the waste?  There's so much waste in government, and no one really addresses it, because it's just  like, oh, it's been there.  It'll always be there.  Fix the waste.  What if they privatize it, though?  That's not a bad...  I've heard that talked about.  Why is that bad for them to privatize it?  I don't know.  People are privatizing their own space endeavors. 
[00:22:30]  You got...  What's his name there from Virgin...  Oh, Branson, yeah.  Branson.  He's doing his own thing.  A lot of people are trying to get into the space program, but to say that NASA is losing  money and wasting it is not accurate.  It's not just like you're throwing money in and getting nothing out.  You're getting amazing technology.  That fucking GPS system, right?  The GPS system you're using in your car every fucking day.  Thank you.  Thank you, NASA and the military.  We invented Tang, by the way, Gregory. 
[00:23:00]  Tang is our invention.  Love the Tang.  Yes, I do, too.  Especially the orange flavor.  How about what you're...  They still sell Tang?  Yes, they do.  How about what you're listening to right the fuck now?  On Craigslist.  Sorry.  We would be...  We'd be out of a gig.  Tang on Craigslist.  Tang.  Where do you think satellite radio comes from?  Where do you think?  They slingshot that shit up into space?  We'd be out of a gig?  We'd be out of a gig.  Is that a bad thing?  NASA...  Not necessarily. 
[00:23:30]  Okay, then who cares?  Everything...  MRI, CAT scans...  There's so much shit.  Ah, we were going to invent that shit no matter what.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's exactly right.  And fair to say it was a waste is stupid.  That's very...  You're short-sighted.  Look at the big picture.  NASA, at least, has given us technology that has made jobs.  It's made complete industries that this country exclusively owned for many years.  All right.  Obama talks about kids going to school and getting degrees. 
[00:24:00]  As many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school.  The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations.  I wonder why.  America's...  Why?  Because the students perhaps are distracted by unruly youths and teens.  I saw some more videos of unruly teens yesterday.  It was fantastic.  Which one was that?  Was that Wendy's?  Not the IHOP one?  The IHOP one.  Yeah.  That's unruly teens.  That's what I say now.  I go, oh, fuck, look, an unruly just passed me. 
[00:24:30]  Ah, shit, an unruly won't get out of the way.  That's my new word.  You see unruly.  You see unrulys every day?  I see unrulys.  They're everywhere.  They're everywhere.  Everywhere.  Everywhere you look?  I see them all the time.  Were you avoiding an unruly when you crashed your car?  No, I wasn't.  That was purely my fault.  I do not...  Sounds like you were a little unruly.  I do not cast blame.  Although I was driving on unruly top.  Jesus.  America's fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, huh.  And so the question is whether all of us, as citizens and as parents, are willing to  do what's necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.  That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities.  Oh, by having, you know, parents...  It's family that first instills the love of learning in a child.  And what are you going to do about that?  Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done. 
[00:25:30]  We need to teach our kids that it's not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves  to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair.  We need to celebrate that nerd.  Because he won't be getting any pussy in high school.  Yeah, yeah.  Science fair.  You're old science.  He's right.  I mean, look, he's right about that.  But it's this idealistic bullshit that, like, anybody can say.  It's...  First of all, for your parents to say, turn off the TV and do your homework, you're already... 
[00:26:00]  You're already doing a great job.  If you have to tell your child, hey, shut the TV off, go inside and do your homework,  you're already a family.  Holy fuck.  You're leaps and bounds ahead of the people that are fucking up out there.  How about...  How about where's our son?  So I could tell him to do his homework.  Homework?  I don't even know if the motherfucker's in school.  Turn off the TV.  What TV? 
[00:26:30]  It was stolen last night.  Exactly.  Or at least ask the TV to stop talking so loud before you ask him to leave.  Transvestite joke.  Yes, Tranny.  It's idealistic stuff, which is fine.  I mean, Kennedy spewed out a lot of idealistic stuff.  But you know what?  There was a certain passion in what he said and a belief in what he said.  And the time in American history, we were very proud as American people. 
[00:27:00]  Not as selfish, I think.  Not as greedy.  More united.  Not as polarized.  And I don't mean racially.  I just mean as a country.  I think you're right.  And we wanted...  We were proud to be the greatest country on the face of the earth.  We were proud that, like, look at what we invented.  And now we...  Look at us.  We give this to your world.  And now it's like, oh, China's doing this, that.  And we're just like, I gotta go work.  Ah, leave me alone.  I...  We don't care anymore.  By the way, watch Obama's speech.  And this is something that they're all guilty of. 
[00:27:30]  They all talk about how we have to work together and how this and that.  And we all have to curtail our speech.  And when it's a Republican president, the Republicans stand up and clap.  And the Democrats act like he just said AIDS is fun.  Yeah.  And the same thing when a Democrat speaks.  Republicans sit on their fat asses.  Fuck...  They don't applaud.  ...all of them.  And they're...  If they can't applaud what he's saying as a courtesy...  You know what I mean?  Like, they're such fucking twats.  Like, they expect us to have a...  Watch your babies.  They talk about it being like a friendly discourse and respectful. 
[00:28:00]  Meanwhile, Hillary and Obama rip each other apart.  Just like McCain and whoever he...  Yeah, yeah.  Beat in the primaries.  And then all of a sudden they're on the same team.  Same team.  Like, Hillary...  Why didn't Hillary come out and go, you know what?  I said that Obama sucked and I like McCain.  So I'm going to stick with McCain for the presidency.  I believe in him.  Like, that's what fucking...  How phony they all are.  Because it's phony.  I'm babbling.  I'm sorry.  No, no, you're not.  Because the way people don't realize the phoniness is...  It amazes me.  Like, that is blatant phoniness. 
[00:28:30]  How one day she can't stand him.  And then, all right, he wins the primary.  She concedes.  And now she likes his policies and what he does.  You were just bashing him for being...  Not having enough experience, if you remember.  She said that.  His policies were too liberal.  And now...  Oh, he's great.  I think McCain and Hillary would have been a really good ticket.  Like, I think that would have been an interesting...  I mean, the hardcore Republicans would have hated it because it's very liberal for a Republican. 
[00:29:00]  But, I mean, a lot better than fucking Sarah Palin.  Better than Palin and McCain and better than Obama and Biden.  Tell you the truth.  Yeah.  You know, I don't dislike Obama.  I kind of just wish he was a vice president and then became president after four or eight years of...  Kind of like Bush Sr. did.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  I would prefer that because that would give him eight years or four years of experience.  A little more experience.  Yeah.  And then put him in...  Learn how things work because this has been...  This is going to be a four-year waste of time.  He really is an idealistic guy and he walked in there thinking, like, I'm going to change everything. 
[00:29:30]  I don't think he's a complete liar at all.  And then all of a sudden it's like, you're not going to change everything.  You're not.  It's just the way it works.  I don't think he's genuine in that I hear what he says and I just see it as the next ploy to get reelected.  You are not going to see a sincere word out of this guy's mouth for two more years because everything he does is going to be a platform to be reelected.  This is his first re-election speech right now is the State of the Union. 
[00:30:00]  Let's say hi to Mike in North Carolina.  Mike!  Mike E.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Mike?  Anthony, you're a funny guy, but you're driving me nuts.  All right.  Where is he driving your nuts, boy?  Is he driving them far from home?  I'm doing accents today.  I didn't sleep a wink.  I'm tired.  I didn't sleep a wink.  You do it.  All right.  On day.  Go ahead, sir.  People like you are the reason why you can't get anything done.  All right.  Queers.  Because he's labeled a Democrat, because he's Obama, no matter what he says, you're going 
[00:30:30]  to criticize it.  Two minutes ago, you just criticized him for telling parents to make their kids do their homework.  I mean, really, can you really be so much against that?  Yes, I can, because the problem is deeper than kids do your homework.  Like I said, if you listen, if you're not listening to what I'm saying, I said, if you have a child  in the house and you have two parents and they're telling their child, now shut that TV off and do  your homework, you're winning the battle right there, because you're automatically, you have 
[00:31:00]  your child in the house, he's gone to school, he's come home, you're actually able to communicate  to him to tell him to shut his TV.  He's not out gangbanging or fucking shooting people or selling drugs.  There are parents in the fucking house that give a shit.  He's not pawned off on his grandmother, because the mother's a crackhead, and the father who  fathered ten children is gone.  That's an important issue as to why our education system sucks a dick, and our scores are low. 
[00:31:30]  Come on.  That was an excellent point for television, that he said sucks a dick.  Well, I know.  You can't say sucks a dick on TV.  That guy, we're an extreme channel there, Fez.  All right, let me say hi to Reggie.  Reggie.  Love Ronnie.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Anthony, you son of a bitch.  Why don't you just fucking say you hate him because he's a nigger?  No.  Everything this guy says, everything he says, you fucking disagree with.  Not because his policy.  Because I don't agree with his policies.  Of course I'm not going to agree with him, because his policies are way too left and way 
[00:32:00]  too social, and I'm a fiscally conservative man.  And he's against me.  Yeah?  I don't understand how Anthony got his subconscious to call.  That was amazing.  That was amazing.  So you would hate Obama just as much if he was white?  I didn't like fucking Carter.  I didn't like fucking...  But you do have a problem when he's black, right?  I didn't like Clinton.  You do have a problem when he's black, no?  Because it affects his agenda. 
[00:32:30]  That's the only problem.  I don't physically have a problem because I look at him and I see a black man as president  of the United States.  A lot of people want to pour that on me.  That's not true.  Like if it was Colin Powell and he was a Republican, you'd like him, right?  I would be like, I don't care he's a black guy.  It's Colin Powell.  I agree with a lot of his politics, aside from the fact that he went in front of the  UN as a puppet and just babbled bullshit that George Bush fed him.  But, and that's where he lost everybody, by the way.  But I don't look at Obama and go, oh god damn, look, we got just a negro in the white 
[00:33:00]  hair.  I'm not like that.  I look at him, though, and see, based on his track record and him as an activist in Chicago,  that his blackness affects his agenda in a way I don't agree with.  And that's the only problem I have with him being a black president.  He should just be a president, not a black president.  Get me?  Thank you.  State of the Union, Obama talks about rebuilding faith in government and being transparent. 
[00:33:30]  In the coming year, we'll also work to rebuild people's faith in the institution of government.  Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you'll  be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history.  Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists.  I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done. 
[00:34:00]  Put that information online.  And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up  legislation with pet projects, both parties and Congress should know this.  Your special interests.  If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.  I will veto it.  How many fucking earmarks have been on bills he has signed because they're left-wing earmarks 
[00:34:30]  put in by his cronies?  He's just talking about the Republicans and the right.  He doesn't want to see any bills come across his desk with those earmarks on it.  How about all the earmarks that were in the fucking first draft of the health care bill?  Stop it.  Stop it.  He's fucking lying.  God.  The only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it.  Great.  Do it.  In domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks 
[00:35:00]  and loopholes.  Oh, that's stupid.  This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid,  which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit.  The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part  of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would  add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit. 
[00:35:30]  As opposed to what you added?  Still, I'm willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans  suggested last year, medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.  I like that.  Yes.  I like that.  Trial lawyers.  That's good.  How much does that cost, Tom?  Is that one of those things you could just jump on and go, hey, everybody agrees with this.  Yay.  And it saves us 20 bucks.  No, the lawsuits, but the lawsuits jack up insurance.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Sure do.  It's like we were talking about the sell list. 
[00:36:00]  It's like you don't know who to hate because it's easy to criticize doctors.  Like, fuck them.  They charge too much.  But then again, they pay tremendous malpractice insurance and they should because a lot of  times they fuck up.  But a lot of times they're the lawsuits they have to deal with are things that are beyond  their control.  Frivolous bullshit.  The lawsuits really make insurance a lot higher than it should be.  People sue.  Like this fucking dumb twat that fell into the fountain.  The fountain.  Yeah.  Oh, I saw an interview with her.  She's crying.  And if it was you, you'd feel different. 
[00:36:30]  And she's retained a lawyer.  You looked like a...  Oh, I just hate...  So what?  You can't sue for looking silly because you weren't paying attention.  Your fat ass was walking right into a fountain, you dummy.  Yeah.  You walked into a fountain because you were texting some fucking fat woman babble.  Which will lead to something we'll talk about after the break, what a new law this lawmaker  wants to make.  Oh, great.  This fucking thing is driving me nuts.  He's a Democrat.  Don't even say what it is yet.  I will always say this. 
[00:37:00]  He's a Democrat.  And once again, I would just like to say for all you civil libertarians out there, will  you stop sniveling that it's only conservatives who are trying to infringe on your civil liberties?  Will you stop it?  This asshole's trying to pass a law that will drive everyone fucking nuts.  Look, if one thing happens and the first thing people do is, we must pass a law.  Shut up.  Some fat dummy fell in a fountain and it was funny.  She's fine.  She looked like an idiot on YouTube.  Great.  Join the club.  Can we try to get this guy on the phone for after the break? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  We can try.  Please.  Let's see if he wants to talk about his stupid law.  More Obama from the State of the Union.  And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can't afford a permanent extension of  the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2% of Americans.  Make sure it's that 2%.  Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should 
[00:38:00]  ask millionaires to give up their tax break.  Shut up.  It's not a matter of punishing their success.  Yes, it is.  It's about promoting America's success.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Just fuck you.  Wow.  You're saying fuck you to the president.  Asking millionaires to give you a fucking...  I worked my balls off.  Shut up.  I've worked for many years. 
[00:38:30]  I have a fucking God-given talent for being hysterical and doing voices.  You are...  Why should I have to chip in to something you think I should?  What's that?  Who the fuck, Chip?  Why should I have to chip in for something you think that I should do?  Because you're the fucking president?  Just stop already.  I pay a fuckload of taxes. 
[00:39:00]  I just mailed one out.  And that isn't even for April.  I gotta get all my shit together and fucking send it off and pay more in April.  And then again in July.  And then again in fucking October.  And again, just shut up.  I pay enough.  Fuck you.  Get out of my pocket.  It is...  You know what?  It's hard to argue with that.  It's like...  Fuck!  They just want to keep fucking taking more.  Enough! 
[00:39:30]  Well, that's what this law's all about that we're gonna talk about.  I had to take a fucking pay cut here when I work, but they don't take that into consideration.  They don't want to take more taxes out of the less money I make?  Fuck you!  Just go fuck yourself, man.  I'm sick of it.  Him is cronies.  Fuck you.  And the wealthiest...  Let me make sure I say 2%, which means 98% of you...  Wow!  You're all under my fucking wing.  Shut up.  God, does this guy stink as the president. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, he just does.  God, enough of you with the taxes.  Cut the fucking...  Cut the spending.  Cut your bullshit fucking program.  Don't do shit spending.  Ah!  Fucking socialist commie.  Enough of him.  God, two more years, please.  Can somebody...  Mitt Romney, anybody, just fucking get in there and take his job away. 
[00:40:30]  Send him back to Chicago with his tail between his legs.  Enough.  Obama talks about gays in the military.  Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our  troops and their families.  Let us serve them as well as they've served us by giving them the equipment they need,  by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our 
[00:41:00]  veterans in the great task of building our own nation.  Our troops come from every corner of this country.  They're black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American.  They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim.  Muslim, we get it!  And yes, we know that some of them are gay.  Today, starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they 
[00:41:30]  love because of who they love.  For loving to suck a cock.  Okay, fuck it!  What's that?  If you like to suck a cock, you can shoot a gun.  I do agree with him there, too.  Enough of keeping gays out of the military.  Gays want to go in there?  Have a pisser.  Have a field deck.  You got more balls than me.  Well, you know.  In their mouth.  On their nose.  In their pockets.  He goes into combat wearing a Roman war helmet like the old days.  Let's go to Andy in Atlanta. 
[00:42:00]  Andy.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  What's up, Andy?  Did you guys see in the section where he was talking about fame is not the answer to  long-term success and all that crap, the lady that was falling asleep?  When they went to the crowd, they showed a black lady sitting, obviously a member of  Congress or something.  And she was dead asleep, and her head just rolled right over, and the camera was dead  on her.  Oh, yeah.  She was sleeping.  A little snooze.  Well, that's because blacks are lazy, right, Ant? 
[00:42:30]  I'm snoozing.  Never said that.  There are plenty of wonderful African-Americans out there that are working very hard.  You'll agree that a white person could fall asleep, too, at the State of the Union, right?  I see them on every commercial.  I see them on commercials for cereal.  I see wonderful families eating together in cereal commercials.  I see wonderful families going to Disney.  I see that on television.  So they're out there.  I know it.  I've seen it.  And finally, this from the State of the Union.  We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. 
[00:43:00]  Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit.  None of this will be easy.  All of it will take time.  And it will be harder because we will argue about everything.  The costs, the details, the letter of every law. 
[00:43:30]  Of course, some countries don't have this problem.  If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad.  Right.  No matter how many homes get bulldozed.  That's it.  Like that.  If they don't want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn't get written.  And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn't a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth. 
[00:44:00]  And that's all, folks.  All right.  State of the Union.  Nice finish.  Nice big finish there.  Good one.  I'll pay for it.  Don't worry.  I got it.  Hey, everybody.  I'm like the guy that walks into the bar.  Only the whole, the bar is the United States.  Hey, everybody.  Don't worry.  I got it.  I got it.  I'm good.  Obama says I got it. 
[00:44:30]  Just do whatever you need to do.  I'll take care of it.  I'll again say it.  The 2% he's talking about make a lot of jobs for people.  You tax them.  The jobs go away.  And that's what happens.  Sorry.  It's just the way it is.  You can see what happened with the economy.  It wasn't taxes, but it was, you know, companies fucking up.  But the bottom line was a lot of businesses weren't getting the income that they had before. 
[00:45:00]  And what did they have to do?  Fire people.  And unemployment went up.  Taxes, it's like the same thing.  You're taking money away from a company, and they're not going to be able to hire as many people as they did.  Unemployment goes up, and you end up where we are now.  So, taxing the evil, oh, the evil 2%, oh, we're like Darth Vaders. 
[00:45:30]  It doesn't help the economy enough.  There's a balance, motherfucker, and it's already way tilted, way tilted.  Flat tax, everyone pays, blow me.  With that, Kevin in Wisconsin.  Kevin.  Hi, I wanted to let Jimmy know that having gays in the military, you know, I mean, it sounds good on paper and everything,  but I did four years in the Marine Corps, and there's no fucking way I'm going to serve with a guy like Fez.  You automatically revert fucking ten years.  You're a bunch of juveniles, man, and you're constantly grabbing ass and giving shit to your buddies. 
[00:46:00]  Dude, hold on, Kevin.  I got to say something.  That's really stupid.  I mean, it's not that you don't want to have a Fez next to you because I don't even know if he's gay, to be honest with you.  Let's say he is.  I have no idea.  But you don't want Fez near you because maybe he's a little unstable.  It has nothing to do with this fucking son.  Fez isn't the kind of guy that would join.  Right.  It has nothing to do with his sexual preference. 
[00:46:30]  He's a little shaky on his feet.  We all know that.  Dude, I know what you're talking about.  Like I said, I have no fucking idea what Fez's deal is.  Military guys have a certain way of behaving.  Hold on.  But the thing is, I know you just used to give me as an example, but even though like military guys have a certain way of behaving and there will be annoying things that happen for you guys.  He's like, don't call each other fags because, you know, like that type stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  But to me, man, other countries do it.  And if a guy wants to serve, they're braver than me.  Like any guy, a gay guy willing to go in there and fucking serve and possibly go to war is fucking braver than me. 
[00:47:00]  I never had the guts to do it.  So I don't think I'm in a position to go, that guy can't do it.  No, no.  Okay, let him in.  But I'm just saying, the guy is going to get so much shit, he's probably going to want to put a bow in it.  And it's just the way that people are.  But don't forget, there's been gays in the military since the U.S. existed, since Rome.  They've always been there.  Since the Revolutionary War.  Yeah.  Now they just don't have to.  And they're in every other facet of life. 
[00:47:30]  It's like you work with gay guys or you have gay guys in school or, you know, whatever.  So it's not like it's a foreign being that they're shipping in and only putting in the military.  Yeah, since the Revolutionary War, who do you think was playing the fife?  Oh, yeah.  You should see right after they painted that, he put the fife up his ass.  Right.  That was great.  No straight man would be playing the fife on the battlefield.  The gay guys now, at least you'll know who not to show your cock to.  It's like, don't bully me.  They've been looking at your dick every shower you took.  One gay guy was staring at your fucking hog. 
[00:48:00]  At least now you'll know who they are and you'll just turn the other way.  Yeah.  Turn your ass to him?  They're good on paper, but I guarantee it would never work.  And why don't they take a vote of the guys that are in the military?  I guarantee it'd be 90% against and maybe 10% for the gays.  Isn't there like psychological testing and all that?  So it has nothing to do with actually being gay.  It's how stable you are as a human being.  And I think then the military realizes that and then maybe get a little desk job somewhere.  You're not getting a flamboyantly gay guy from the fucking Halloween parade here in New York 
[00:48:30]  that's going to go to the recruiting office and say, I want to be a Marine.  It's not going to happen.  We're going to get normal guys that just like the cock.  Yeah.  You know, like I said, it looks good on paper, but I guarantee you...  I just like the fact that...  No, no, no.  Look, look.  You're 15 old kids, man.  Fuck everything.  I like the fact that the new doll is coming out.  The G.I. Moe is coming out.  I'm collecting them all. 
[00:49:00]  And the Kung Fu grip is in his asshole.  All right.  Have a good day, boys.  All right.  All right, man.  Well, what are you going to do?  That fucking...  Guy doesn't want the gays in the military.  Keith in Connecticut.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Anthony, after you watched the speech last night and you were nice and happy,  did you just happen to go out in the garage and see the empty space where your Mustang used to be?  Yeah, that was pretty hard to do.  Where are you at with your craziness?  Where are you at with your car?  Well, the dizziness is pretty much gone completely. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, I did some of the...  Dr. Steve, he sent me some of those head exercise things to do, and I did them, and it worked.  Yeah, it's fucked up.  So, yeah, the dizziness is, I'd say, about 90% gone.  And today, I've got to go and pick the car up, put it on another flatbed, and send it to my garage.  You're tweeting some pictures of that shit today, or what?  I will today.  I'll take some pictures today and then tweet it.  But, yeah, it's, you know, it's what it is. 
[00:50:00]  It happens.  They're now calling it a wild ride.  Wild ride!  Because the door was open on a trade.  Fucking media should just...  They should all be fucking killed.  They're just terrible.  A wild ride.  I guess there's no news today.  People are getting some nice fresh air on the train.  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah, probably stunk in there anyway.  Wild ride.  What's wrong with everybody?  Let's go to Don in Jersey.  Don, what's going on?  Hey there, Dan.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Listen, Anthony, my nephew is starting college next year.  Can we have some money? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  I'll send some over.  Why should I have to send you money?  Why not?  You're a millionaire.  Yeah, and I earned it, so why don't you go earn it?  I'm good!  Well, the college thing's out of control.  Well, well.  There's going to be some rioting over college fucking costumes.  World needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  That is the biggest scam going.  You could save a shitload of money in that area.  Here's a major in the Army.  He wants to talk to that guy that just called in.  Jason in Ohio. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, guys.  How you doing?  What's up, man?  Yeah, that gentleman who just called in was completely ignorant and out of line.  I've been working on different referendums and policies in my job as a lawyer in the military to get this passed.  I've also got experience as a combat arms officer.  And here's the gist of it.  There have been gay guys serving forever.  You're going to call them a faggot anyway.  You get over it and you fight together.  That was just a typical ignorant response. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, I think, as they call it, the shit goes down.  As long as he's well-trained and no shit goes down your balls.  But, Jason, that's the shit, we know.  Jason, that's the problem, though.  I mean, people certainly feel that way.  I'm sure he's not the only one that feels that way.  No, and I would say he's in the minority whether he thinks he's in the majority or not.  Yeah, you think it's a minority now that think that way.  Well, the reason you don't pull soldiers is because it's a command decision.  Yeah, it's not a fucking democracy in the military. 
[00:52:00]  You fucking do what you're told.  No.  When I was a little fucking grunt and I got told to move out and draw a fire, that's what I did.  I went and shot Al-Qaeda in the face.  And that's because I was told to do it.  Is it true the gays don't want to call it grunt?  They want to call it grok?  No, I haven't heard anything like that.  Cunt.  Cock.  See?  Wow.  I didn't get it.  Holy shit.  Let the gay guy drop this bomb.  I mean, the only issue you really run into is housing. 
[00:52:30]  Enlisted throughout the military, you're saying, well, how do you house gays?  You have to house them separately to cost more money?  Just live with the gays.  Yeah.  Really?  You're sleeping, what?  You're going to get a cock up your ass?  Yeah.  It'll be just fine for everybody.  Just think at the bars.  It could be so much easier because you could get four gay guys on one bar stool if you just turn it over.  Well, that's one way to look at it.  That old gag.  I'm sure the Coast Guard would be in favor of that one.  Oh, you're saying the Coast Guard has a lot of maybe, mm-hmm?  Yeah, Coast Guard definitely sucks more dick than any other board. 
[00:53:00]  Wow.  I heard that on their commercial for recruiting.  They suck more dick.  You could put that on a banner ad somewhere.  Some fucker will buy it.  Some Coast Guard guy is, like, so pissed right now.  And this guy's, uh, pro-  I know.  Military and he's saying that.  See, but this is the shit that happens.  What a wonderful world.  You just get guys, they're going to make fun.  They're going to fucking talk shit.  Yeah, guys are going to be guys in the end.  Fuck it.  But, uh, if someone's shooting at you, you're not going to give a shit if that guy's gay next to you,  if he's, you know, proficient with a gun. 
[00:53:30]  No.  One of my best friends came out of the closet about a year and a half ago after we got back from a deployment.  Yes.  Yes, his name is Steve.  Um, well, this guy, uh, couldn't be a better officer.  I don't care if he's gay or not, because in a firefight, he was, uh, he was a good guy to have on your side.  Did you know that he was gay or suspect?  Oh, yeah.  No doubt about it.  Um, he would make impromptu-  I was in, uh, the 3rd Infantry Division out of Savannah, Georgia.  Right, okay.  And this guy would make impromptu trips to Atlanta. 
[00:54:00]  Just go, I'm going to visit friends.  Oh, friends.  And finally, we were like, yeah, dude, who are you going to visit?  Who do you go every other weekend to see?  When, when you had, uh, when you had, uh, be on point, were you nervous when he said, I'll be right behind you?  Well, it didn't work like that.  We were in a different unit, but I definitely would have worn, uh, uh, ballistic armor on my asshole around him.  That's what they're going to do.  They're going to start wearing ballistic armor.  Instead of just a vest, they'll, they'll pad their asses with it.  Yes, yep.  Kevlar on your bunger.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:54:30]  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Let me say hi to Paul.  Paul, what's going on?  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey there, Paul.  Hi.  Hey, uh, I just wanted to say, I think it would all mess up because you're not going to have a bunch of guys, junior Marines, junior Army guys, follow a gay leader.  It's just not going to happen, especially downrange, especially in combat.  Yeah?  I just don't think, you know, no one's going to follow someone who's gay, and if you come out, you don't, you go away from the don't ask, don't tell, no one's going to follow that. 
[00:55:00]  I don't think it's, here's what, here's the deal.  I don't think it's so much that you're going to get this influx of flamboyantly gay guys in the military.  I think nothing's going to change, aside from the fact that gay guys aren't going to have to worry that if it does come out, that they're going to lose their career.  I think it's just going to be the same guys that have been leading you, or the same guys you've been leading, and, uh, there's going to be no huge change in, uh, the way, the way, uh, gays act in the military. 
[00:55:30]  I don't see it happening like that.  Yeah, I mean, you got a good point on that.  I mean, I, you know.  Yes, I do.  All right, Paul.  Anything else?  All right, thank you.  Let's go to, uh, Greg on Long Island.  Greg?  Greg?  Greg.  Greg.  All right.  What's happening?  He's got echo.  Echo.  Echo.  Now batting.  Yes.  Number 25.  This guy has a story about his father.  Some guy. 
[00:56:00]  Charlie, Rhode Island.  Number 25.  Hey, Charlie.  How you doing, boys?  What's up?  Hey, not much.  Hey, I was talking to my dad about gays in the military.  He's a 20-year Marine Corps vet.  He didn't say that he's all for it with his hand in his pants, did he?  His opinion is that during a fire fight, all they're going to want to do is suck each  other's cocks and fuck each other in the ass.  It's hysterical the way he thinks about that.  Oh, my God.  He's an old school guy.  Old school guy, right?  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:30]  It's hysterical.  I never stop laughing for him.  Yeah.  I hear you.  All right, brother.  I guess we could take a break here.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Charlie.  How come no one's talking about energy prices?  I did talk about that for four hours on a date recently, right into the girl's vagina.  I didn't even lick.  I just talked energy prices at her clit.  Did she get off?  Yeah.  Her stupid vagina looked at me like a horse mouth, but smelled worse.  Oh, shit. 
[00:57:00]  Big dopey horse lips.  Faded.  Faded an apple.  Faded an apple.  Yes, a Granny Smith green.  I just shoved it in.  Then I heard key runch.  I'm glad I didn't stick my dick in there.  All right, boys.  That was good.  All right, man.  I think we covered it.  Oh, God.  Quick break.  And, yeah, this law they want to pass or this idiot wants to pass.  Yeah.  And it's once again about just trying to get more money from us.  That's all this is about, obviously.  We'll explain next. 
[00:57:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Outrageous.  Borderline.  Illegal.  Audio Entertainment.  Entertainment.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  Virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM.  Wow, that's wild. 
[00:58:00]  What is that about?  In case you got to throw up, right?  All right, they show the hospital.  I didn't hear the sound, but you got to know what happened.  What happened?  I don't know.  I'm looking.  It says, suspect bails from moving a police car.  Yeah.  And they showed the windshield cam of the car on a highway doing highway speed.  And they showed the back seat cam.  And they showed the back seat cam of this chick.  She's sitting there cuffed.  And the window is open.  The back window.  And she just wiggles out head first. 
[00:58:30]  She's cuffed.  And just flies out the window.  And then the next shot they showed was a hospital.  So I guess she didn't get too far.  But she didn't die.  I don't know.  Because it looks like the car was going pretty damn fat.  Yeah.  I bet she was drunk and they left the window open so she wouldn't puke.  Because there was a little pink bucket next to her.  So I bet you she was fucking nauseous.  She said, fuck this.  I'm out of here.  Yeah, leave the window open.  I'm going to vomit.  That's hardcore, motherfucker.  That's hardcore. 
[00:59:00]  So here's your law.  The latest law.  All right.  And let's keep in mind that the politicians don't give a fuck about the individual whatsoever.  No.  What they care about is making more money.  The almighty dollar.  It's all about money when they come up with these wacky laws.  Chasing the Yankee dollar.  There's a guy, New York State Senator Carl Kruger.  We've heard of the Carl Kruger over the years.  Yes.  He wants to make his state's streets safer.  How do you make streets safer? 
[00:59:30]  He's talking about the sidewalks, by the way.  Well, let's see.  And I guess the streets, technically.  Dude, this is all of a sudden.  What do you see?  I think he's saying the Asians can't drive, right?  That's not right.  That doesn't make the sidewalk safer.  Oh, Jimmy, you should wait till more of the story has been told.  Thank God we're on satellite, not K-Rock.  They would have dumped out of that.  Extreme channel there.  To do that, he's not proposing a tough new gun law or advocating for broader police search powers.  No, Senator Kruger sees a greater danger out there. 
[01:00:00]  Distracting gadgets.  Gadgets?  Anyone who calls things gadgets.  Well, this guy is really old, obviously, and has no fucking clue what's going on out there.  He don't use the gadget.  He hopes to ban the use of mobile phones, iPods, and other gadgets by pedestrians in major cities while crossing the street.  Come on.  This fucking idiot.  That's how we live now.  We all live just walking and looking down at our phones.  And in New York City...  And guess what?  Every once in a while, you're going to lose one.  Yes.  But that means make it safe for everybody. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, it's not really good.  When everyone else can handle that type of thing.  Does he realize in Manhattan, you're crossing a street every, like, fucking 50 steps?  Right.  So what are you supposed to do?  Take your fucking iPhone, stop talking, or take the earbuds out?  Right.  This is so unrealistic.  Kruger set a series of accidents in his Brooklyn district.  Where are these a series of accidents?  Must have been two or three.  Must have been a couple, right?  Wow.  A couple of dummies.  And if you're stupid enough to not pay attention when you've got your iPod or your phone in front of you when you cross the street and you get hit by a truck, that's your problem. 
[01:01:00]  Sorry.  That's the mentality of the government being your mommy and daddy.  Right.  That's not what you want.  I don't need them to make me safer.  I can handle my fucking phone.  Don't protect me.  And I can handle my fucking iPad.  Because someone else was stupid.  Get this asshole on the phone.  I'm sick of these politicians.  So a few things happened in his district.  So he's now thinking, well, fuck, we got to do something.  Concerned about the number of pedestrians he saw paying closer attention. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, so, all right, let me read that sentence again.  Kruger set a series of accidents in his Brooklyn district made him concerned about the number of pedestrians he saw paying closer attention to their device.  than to what was in front of them.  Yeah, but nothing happened to those people.  No.  He just noticed.  He's been trying since 2007 to ban the use of distracting gadgets by pedestrians crossing streets in major New York cities with a population of one million or more.  Violators, and this is what it's about right the fuck here, violators will face a $100 fine. 
[01:02:00]  This is about making more revenue.  It's getting more money out of your fucking back pocket because most of us could handle this.  But then you put a police officer in a busy area and he's writing $100 tickets all day long.  It's a gadget tax.  Gadget tax.  Exactly.  That's what it is.  Fucker.  Distracted pedestrians put others at risk when they don't react in a manner others would reasonably predict.  Attorney Mark Harrell told FoxNews.com.  You know, the drivers could help because I do every day. 
[01:02:30]  My fucking horn gets so much use at intersections.  Yeah.  Driving to Manhattan.  Bam!  And people are just like, I got to get back on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It says don't walk.  Get out of the fucking road.  Arkansas Senator Jimmy Jeffress backed a similar proposal to Kruger's, one that would make it illegal for pedestrians and bikers to wear headphones near or on streets before retracting his plans Tuesday afternoon.  Yeah, exactly.  Because he realizes that what a dopey thing to do. 
[01:03:00]  So there you go.  What do you think?  There's no way this will pass, right?  No, that ain't getting anywhere.  That don't have legs.  Stupid fucking politicians.  The dumb broad in Jersey backed off her license plate thing for bikes.  Yep.  She got off of that one.  She backed off quickly.  She realized how stupid she looked.  Man.  You can't make people get license plates for bicycles.  For a lot of money.  And the reason was because some old people get knocked over by bike people, I guess. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And now the old person who can't see anyway pops up and tries to read a tiny little license plate on the back of the bike.  Yeah.  That was her reasoning.  Meanwhile, the reasoning is, let's soak the bicyclist for some cash, too, like we do the drivers.  Yeah, it's always about trying to protect the individual, but it has nothing to do with that, man.  It just doesn't.  It comes down to money.  Why wouldn't they do this, then?  Why wouldn't they do this?  Instead of fining somebody $100, they're walking across the street. 
[01:04:00]  They've got their iPhone buds in their ears, and they get caught.  How about you give them a ticket, and they have to appear at some kind of safety seminar.  See?  That helps the problem.  Just giving them a $100 fine doesn't inform the person what they're doing wrong.  And if you want to help the people, then educate them.  Ooh.  Right.  Bullshit.  Take their money.  When you get a speeding ticket, you don't slow down.  No.  You really don't.  You slow down while you pull away.  Okay, everyone drives the most legally when they're pulling away from just getting a ticket. 
[01:04:30]  That's the most legal.  I actually put my hand out the window for an arm signal and fucking blinker.  It's like my road test is going on again.  10 and 2, adjust the mirror.  Yeah, yeah.  35 miles an hour.  It's extremely nerve-wracking, though.  You drive so good right when you pull away from a cop.  The trooper's right behind you.  Like, oh, fuck, I've got to get back on the highway properly.  Oh, and I hate when they have to go the same way you're going for a while, and you're just like,  let me pass them.  Should I wave?  You think the trooper pulls over the same car within a mile? 
[01:05:00]  It's probably happened.  It probably has happened?  Yeah, it's probably happened.  But don't they understand there's a major panic going on?  Yeah, don't you understand?  At that point?  I think every cop knows that the person that's driving after they get pulled over is freaking out with you behind them.  I think they play that up, too, and have some fun.  I would do a super trooper so bad and just turn the lights on, make them pull over again, pass them, reverse, turn the lights on again.  Yes.  You know how fast you're going?  Richard, Wisconsin.  Fuck that congressman.  It's called thinning the herd. 
[01:05:30]  I'm all about thinning the herd.  Yeah.  We're going against nature.  If you can't fucking cross the street and look at your phone at the same time, you know, whatever happens to you, it happens.  We can't breed out the stupidity when they're being protected.  Like, what do you think?  A three-legged fucking hyena baby, you think they protect that shit?  Hell no.  They eat it.  They leave it behind.  Eat the stupid.  They're not going to fucking wait for you.  Exactly.  Had it.  Oh, boy.  Let's go to Ron in South Carolina. 
[01:06:00]  Ron.  Yeah.  Welcome aboard, Ron.  Hold on a minute before we change subjects because Steve in Alberta has got something.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  My name ain't Steve.  I don't give a fuck.  Whatever it is.  How about guy with the computer up too loud?  Yeah, yeah.  Too loud.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Hold on, man.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, really?  But you're the asshole.  Where's the problem?  How are we the problem?  All right.  It's like we're in a cave. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, me?  That's a law in Alberta here.  You can't.  Turn down your fucking radio.  Sorry, your radio's too loud.  Your radio's too loud.  Hold on.  For Christ's sake.  Yeah, where the problem?  Yeah, where the problem?  Yeah, where the problem?  Where the problem?  Where the problem?  Where the problem?  I'm computing it right now.  Where the problem?  Where the problem?  There.  There.  I like hearing myself.  How hard was that to do?  It was.  As a matter of fact, it was rather difficult. 
[01:07:00]  I'm not used to using that computer.  Took me a couple seconds.  Sorry about that.  Boy, this is the angry.  It's Steve the angry Canadian.  Yes.  You don't remember Steve.  He calls from time to time.  Go ahead, Steve.  Okay, Steve.  There we go.  I'm saying that.  Oh, whatever your name is.  That's right.  It's Steve.  January 1st this year.  Yeah.  For Canada?  No, for Alberta.  For this province.  I don't know fuck shit about Canada.  What's the fucking law?  Where's Alberta?  What's the law?  It's up there.  Right next to BC. 
[01:07:30]  You're way up.  You've never heard of that?  No, no, no.  That's a...  I'm fine.  What's the law, though?  The law that you can't drive with this shit.  Oh, I thought I was waiting for a click there.  Where you can't drive with any kind of cellular device.  You can't fucking put on makeup.  Yeah, but they're talking about walking.  Dude, Steve.  Steve, they're talking about walking.  See?  We're talking about...  Yeah, I know.  But why would anybody want to walk like that, though?  Oh, my God.  Walk right into you. 
[01:08:00]  Do you see the Northern Lights?  Idiots that walk around attached to that fucking cell phone.  Steve, Steve, do you see the Northern Lights where you live?  Steve?  Steve?  I know, right?  Steve?  Steve, do you see the Northern Lights where you live, Steve?  No, no, no.  No?  No?  Edmonton.  I'm only in Calgary.  I'm not that far.  Oh, you're Calgary.  Okay, that's South Alberta.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Who knew?  I thought everyone in Canada saw the Northern Lights.  Why on earth would you be sorry?  I thought...  I don't know. 
[01:08:30]  Wow, this guy's just bitter.  No, thanks, guys.  Thanks for entertaining us.  All right.  All right.  Steve is the angriest Canadian.  Hey, most Canadians are just like, hey, how you doing?  They're all fun.  He calls from time to time.  He stays up all night and then he calls us.  So angry.  You know, if they pass the law because you're putting on makeup and stuff, you know, when  you're driving, I have no problem with that.  I've seen that shit.  Pull those fucking assholes over.  That's some fun shit to watch.  Leave me alone when I'm trying to cross the street and I'm fucking looking at my Twitter 
[01:09:00]  or something.  My biggest problem...  I can handle it.  ...problem still is, aside from, you know, cold tires on cold streets, is people that  just won't get out of the way.  Just get out of the fucking way.  Oh, God.  Let's say hi to Kevin in South Carolina.  Kevin.  Yeah.  Kev.  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's up?  I was just going to tell you guys, I once got pulled over for minding my own business,  riding a bike in Florida with headphones on.  So there's a law in a place called Longboat Key, Florida, where you can't have headphones  on to ride a bike. 
[01:09:30]  And that's all about getting a little revenue for that area.  It has nothing to do about you and your safety.  Nothing.  I was telling you.  Just minding my own business and I literally got pulled over by a police car.  So, anyways.  All right, man.  Have a good day, man.  You have a good day.  This guy's saying Arkansas, huh?  Pete, Arkansas.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  When you were talking about the New York guy, he's actually just still trying to get  the texting and walking disbanded, even though he did away with the MP3 players and everything 
[01:10:00]  else.  He's still trying to get that texting and walking stuff.  So you can't text and walk?  They want to make a law down there, too?  It'll legalize, yeah.  They're trying to figure out how to get more money from us.  You're not allowed to wear headphones in a car here, but that's obvious because you  can't hear horns.  Right.  What?  You're not supposed to wear headphones in a car when you're driving here.  I can't hear you.  Oh.  If you're a headphone.  Well, down here, you can pretty much be blindfolded and drive.  What's that?  Well, this guy.  Hey.  You're crazy. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  So he's still trying to get the texting and walking thing passed.  Who is it?  Another guy?  No, the guy that was in the story that backed off on a wall.  What a nudge this guy is.  A nudge.  It's the way of the world, man.  We're all on our phones.  You know, sometimes you do bump into someone headfirst when you're walking on a sidewalk.  Exactly.  Why does it have to be illegal?  Who cares?  Just bump into them and go, sorry.  Right.  You step in dog shit, too.  Right.  This voice kind of scared me a little bit.  You come back from commercials.  You played Van Halen.  I thought you ran out of dump.  Linger longer.  Wow.  This guy's been around. 
[01:11:00]  Steve Orlando.  What's up?  Yeet.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I heard a news story here.  They were talking about, I don't know what's going on up in Alberta, but I heard a news  story here that this was a result of the girl taking a tumble into the fountain while  she was on her fucking cell phone.  Yeah, we were just talking about that.  I think it is.  It sort of is because that was mentioned in the story.  But she was just a dope.  She was just a stupid dope.  And we should all point and laugh.  That's what humans do is point and laugh when someone falls.  Get over it.  Why the fuck does she have a lawyer? 
[01:11:30]  You're a viral video.  Enjoy it.  Right.  Have fun.  They fired the security guards that released it.  Yeah, they did.  I guess you're not supposed to do that, but.  I'm glad they did, though, for our enjoyment.  Thank you.  I'm all for it.  True fucking humor.  Jesus Christ.  True fucking heroes.  Those guys are.  I saw her interview.  She was fucking atrocious.  Was she?  Oh, dude.  Crying.  Which is what it was like, payday?  If it happened to you, you would shut up, bitch.  It didn't.  And if it did, oh, well.  What are you going to do about it?  It's her fault. 
[01:12:00]  I bet nobody just was walking straight and walked into that fountain.  Find me one person, unless they were blind.  And she's familiar with that mall, too.  Very familiar.  She was texting away and looking at her phone and being a dummy and fell into a fountain.  It's her fault.  This is some of that litigation, that wasteful fucking bullshit that goes on.  Oh, God.  Sue her.  Sue everyone. 
[01:12:30]  Fall in the fountain.  Oh, okay, okay.  We got a trooper or a police officer.  You know how we were just talking about being pulled over and then it's nerve-wracking to  pull away with the cop right behind you?  Yeah.  Matt's got a story.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, what's up, boy?  Hey, man.  Trooper, regular.  What's your job there, brother?  City cop.  I called one time right after I got tased.  You guys remember that?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh.  And I told you I was going to come up there and tase Jimmy for you if you wanted me to.  They wouldn't allow it, but I was willing to get tased right on my cock.  Why wouldn't they allow it? 
[01:13:00]  It's part of training.  That's right.  Hey, but, yeah, pulling people over and then follow them after you pull them over is one  of the main perks of this job.  I knew it.  It's hilarious.  People signal for turns like quarter mile before they have to turn.  And they make sure they look back and make sure you see them put their seatbelt on.  Yeah.  You got to make sure, look, I'm putting my seatbelt on.  Have you ever pulled over the same person within a mile?  No, I haven't. 
[01:13:30]  I've been real tempted.  You know, sometimes people will tell you.  You should do that and then walk up to their car and just go, I'm just kidding.  I'm just fucking with you.  I'm just fucking with you.  I'm just fucking with you.  I was going to see if you'd really pull over.  Right, right.  You've come close, though, huh?  Yeah, I mean, because people, you know, they're acting weird and they tell you, make three  left-hand turns and go back the same way.  You're like, where the fuck are you going?  A little suspicious.  Yeah, yeah.  You ever shoot anyone?  I have not shot anyone yet.  Wow.  One of these days, huh? 
[01:14:00]  I shoot competition, so I'm itching, dude.  I'm itching.  So is Ann.  You know what?  It's definitely itching, too.  When you said there's a trooper on the phone, I thought it was going to be a chick who takes  cum in the mouth and ass.  That is a trooper.  Not quite.  I am no ass gay.  No.  No, of course not.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Very good.  Have a good day.  Yeah, you too.  Careful out there.  So we got that going on.  We're trying to get the senator on the phone.  Senator!  To talk about that dumb law he's trying to pass. 
[01:14:30]  Dumb law.  Ridiculous.  That one's just another ridiculous law.  It's actually called the dumb law.  Yeah.  Why they put that down.  What?  We have other dumb laws they've passed recently.  Is there any way to look that up?  New jerk reaction laws because one person did something stupid and now they assume we all  have to be saved by it.  A few times a year you'll get a news report where they'll say, well, this year alone we've  passed 10,587 new laws.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  What are all those laws about?  Hey, what's this law I'm seeing? 
[01:15:00]  What's this law that I'm seeing up on all the fucking lit signs?  It signs over the highways that says, uh, new law, new law here in New York, you have  to, um, pull over for stopped emergency vehicles.  See, I don't understand this law that it's such a vague description of what this fucking  law is supposed to be that even I read it and I go, all right, are you supposed to pull  over for emergency vehicles coming by you?  I know that I do that. 
[01:15:30]  I pull over to the right and that's it.  But it's, you're supposed to, it says move over for stopped emergency vehicles.  Now, does that mean if I'm in the right lane and they're stopped in the right lane, I got  to move into the middle lane or like what is, what the fuck does that mean?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Pull over for moving emergency vehicles.  Yeah.  We, we've had to do that forever.  That isn't a new law.  That one's makes sense.  Some of these laws do make sense.  Of course. 
[01:16:00]  Uh, JD in New York city.  You got something?  Yeah.  What's up?  It's, it's to move over.  Like if, if a cop stops somebody in the, in, in the right lane or the, or the shoulder,  you should move over maybe to the middle lane.  So you don't like maybe hit them.  What if there's somebody in the middle lane next to you?  You should probably drive on the shoulder or stop.  Logically, don't, that's what people do anyway.  Yeah.  Like.  And then the cops, they angle their car too to, you know, make sure they're a little  more protected.  The law requires motorists to drive with caution when approaching an emergency vehicle that  is parked on the side of the road with lights activated.  All right. 
[01:16:30]  Here's what they don't want.  They don't want you zipping past at fucking 60 miles an hour and the right lane on the hip  right when you, right when you're there.  Okay.  That should only be done if another lane in the same direction as available and the move  can be made safely without impeding other traffic.  No one can get a ticket for this.  If you get a ticket for this, you're on an empty road doing 80 miles an hour next to a  cop with his lights on in the right lane.  Correct.  Because there's a way out of this.  Look, there was a car next to me.  I couldn't get in safely.  Dismissed.  This is the dumb new law. 
[01:17:00]  I like the, the, the meaning is good.  It's to protect the cops that are pulled over.  But like I said, many times when I get pulled over, I will roll my window down and kind  of wave at the cop.  If it's, if it's going to take a while to pull over, I'll, I'll put my blinker on and  I'll wave to him.  Like I see you and I'm pulling over.  I'll slow down and pull off of a highway, pull into a parking lot under a light.  If it's nighttime, I always make sure I'm in a very safe spot for everyone involved.  I'm not trying to run, but, uh, you know, cause you see people, some people pull over 
[01:17:30]  when they get pulled over in the HOV lane and they stop in the HOV lane.  I want to kill him.  It's like, look, you see him there.  He's not going to put his lights on and start shooting out your tires.  Wait till you can pull out of the HOV lane all the way to the right.  Use your blinker and your mirrors.  It might take a little while, but I think the officer will understand that he's not standing  in the HO fucking V lane and, uh, it makes it a lot safer.  I drive faster when the fuzz puts their lights on. 
[01:18:00]  Man!  You ain't stopping me, fuzz.  Uh, we go to Robert in Kansas.  Robert.  Anthony, you're a tool.  No wonder you wrapped up your Mustang.  Uh-oh, what happened?  It's a simple law.  Slow down if you can't move over.  And if you can move over, put your blinker on, move over a lane, and proceed about your business.  It's not simple.  Without putting your foot in the gas on a car, you can't.  It's not simple the way they have it written on these fucking lit-up signs over the highway. 
[01:18:30]  It's not.  I wanted, uh, some clarity on this issue.  He, uh, hung up.  Also, uh, announced today they're trying to get that, uh, law passed with the $10 if you  enter lower Manhattan.  Oh, they want to do that now?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, he tried to do that a couple of years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, that didn't work.  Bloomberg.  So you already, you already pay in most cases to get to Manhattan through fucking, uh, you  know, the bridges and tunnels.  And then if you go to lower Manhattan, it's going to cost you another $10. 
[01:19:00]  They're not talking about a bridge or something.  They're talking about you're on Manhattan Island going downtown, and then you got to pay another  $10.  Right.  Holy shit.  That's crazy.  We've given you guys enough money.  Figure out where the fuck it's going.  Stop already.  Bloomberg is a rich, elitist douchebag.  Enough already.  He really is an elitist baby boy.  He has no clue what's going on.  Figure out where the money's going.  You don't need more.  People can't afford this shit, asshole. 
[01:19:30]  Uh, go to dumblaws.com for really dumb, stupid laws.  This could be good.  It's illegal to fuck in the ass or have oral sex in some places.  What?  Those sodomy laws.  Where is that?  A lot of places.  I don't like the sound of that.  Those are the old laws.  I want, I want some of the new laws where they really, really fucking soak you are just  trying to soak us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause we know the New York a little bit.  Yeah.  Tell me.  Fucking dumb, fucking shit. 
[01:20:00]  Okay.  Women may go topless in public, providing it is not being used as a business.  How about that?  It is illegal for a woman to be on the street wearing body hugging clothing.  That can't be true.  But it's, what does that mean?  She could wear, put it, she could bring her tits out, but she can't wear body hugging 
[01:20:30]  clothing.  What does that mean?  Like, uh, I don't know.  The smoking thing a hundred feet from an entrance to the public.  Oh, that's silly.  Citizens may not greet each other by putting one's thumb in the nose and wiggling the fingers.  Stop it.  What fucking dumb site is this?  That's probably true.  That's probably from like the 1800s.  Ah, no wiggling of the fingers.  Well, how about a fine of $25 can be levied for flirting?  Flirting.  Oh, no.  I don't feel like doing morning zoo radio. 
[01:21:00]  I'm going to bail on that site.  Stupid shit.  Dumb fucking stupid shit.  Yeah, that is dumb.  Stop it.  We got Big A to do some news.  Big A is here?  We got Tom Papa coming in at eight o'clock.  Big A looks like Chaz Bono now.  Really?  He lost weight.  Chaz Bono.  Chaz Bono wants to look like, uh...  Michael Chickliss.  Yeah, Michael Chickliss.  Michael Chickliss.  Good choice.  And she had her boobies removed.  Maybe Chaz Bono's problem was that her mom is so hot and such a sex symbol that she wasn't 
[01:21:30]  getting a little up to that, so she was depressed.  So fuck it?  Yeah, because she was just a big fatso.  Could be.  I think there was a lot of shit going on there in order to make you cut your tits off and  fucking wish you had a dick and look like Michael Chickliss.  I know.  That's a little more than your mom was hot.  You're right.  Yeah, there's a lot going on there.  Yeah, there's some fucked up shit going on.  Of all the men, she wants to look like Michael Chickliss.  Michael Chickliss.  Cher's got some fucked up DNA, because her son, Greg Allman, is a little weird, too. 
[01:22:00]  Elijah.  Look up Elijah.  Is he the gay?  I mean, it's more than that.  It's more than that.  Yeah.  If you're gay, you're gay.  Whatever.  But I mean, I think he was a tranny or something.  Oh.  He was like all in.  He had something going on.  Look him up on the wick.  On the wiki.  The wiki, wiki, wiki.  Where's Big A to do some news?  And then Jerry Springer coming in at 9.  And then Olivia Munn in studio at 940.  That is a big fucking booking right there.  Olivia Munn.  Everyone's talking about Olivia Munn. 
[01:22:30]  She's in Maxim.  Yeah.  And the cover got banned in a lot of places, right?  Oh, right, right, right.  She's quite the dish.  That was because of her crotch shot.  Yeah.  Did you see what they did to subscribers?  Ooh.  People that subscribe to Maxim?  They fucked them.  They took the label with the address and put it right over her crotch.  Not on purpose.  That's just...  Oh, you don't think?  That's where the label goes.  I bet.  I bet they did that to keep the controversy down.  That's where the label goes.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  I'm pissing off everybody.  It's like, why would you do that?  Why does the label go on the best spot?  Because they're not going to redo the labeling machines.  I bet you could turn the screw and put it one place or the other up, down.  You think?  I think they could adjust that pretty easy.  Then they should have.  I think that's where the label goes every time, which pissed off everybody, because then  you pull that thing off and you can't see the crotch, because it takes half the cover  off with it, right?  Yeah.  You can't do that.  Then you get that big rip in there, and you're like, ah, no.  Wow.  Big A really did lose...  Oh, that's Travis. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, jeez.  Big A is walking down the hallway.  Holy shit.  Big A did lose some weight, huh?  He did lose some weight.  Like I said, he was over the house for the jet game, and we were eating some pizza, and he  had his little salad with his little low-fat dressing.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, he's trying to lose some weight.  He definitely looks a lot better.  Yeah, yeah.  He lost a good amount of weight.  Slow down.  He's doing okay.  Keep it going.  He lost like 50 pounds, right?  There he goes.  What's up, Big A?  Hey, Big E.  I have to call you Little A.  Yeah, Big A is losing some weight.  Damn, brother. 
[01:24:00]  You look a little healthier.  Much healthier.  How many pounds did you lose?  About 55 pounds.  55 pounds.  And the doctors want you to lose how much?  830.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm close.  Do you have more energy?  Do you feel better?  Oh, yes.  You do feel better?  Much more energy, yeah.  Yeah?  More energy to eat.  I'm kidding, of course.  And you're used to the food now, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, you're not.  No one is.  No, he could take temptation, though.  We were eating pizza, and then you got his little salad. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, I had a salad with chicken, and pasta, and I had no pizza, no cake.  But you wanted the pizza and cake.  No.  Who doesn't?  He's had enough pizza.  Absolutely not.  Yeah.  Really?  No.  God bless you.  You've eaten enough pizza and cake in your life.  E-Rock, do you want pizza and cake?  Who doesn't?  No, he wants cake on pizza.  Pizza cake.  New pizza cake at Domino's.  Who doesn't?  Garlic butter saw.  Right.  Who doesn't? 
[01:25:00]  Well, good for you, Big A.  Hey, Big E.  What else is going on with you?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Nothing.  Working?  Nothing much.  Yeah, just working a little bit.  Well, thrilling.  All right.  And what is Big A here for today?  He's going to do some news.  Oh, he's going to do some news.  You know, there's a lot of stuff that we don't get to on a daily basis.  That is true.  We'd like to.  You want to do a couple news stories for us, Big A?  All right. 
[01:25:30]  We love when you do the news.  Oh, Big A with the news.  Hold on to your hats.  Do we have any music or anything?  Oh, here it is.  There.  Yeah, we have that at least.  We got the ticker.  We have that at least.  The 1010 Winds ticker.  No, this is three very quick stories, so this should take two minutes.  Nothing.  All right, Big A.  Big A with the news, everyone.  Good morning.  My name is Big A, and I'm here to...  I'm here to... 
[01:26:00]  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  I'm here to...  with some stories.  President Obama delivered the annual State of the Union address last night. 
[01:26:30]  The President ordered his aid of the Union by walking in to a standing ovation. 
[01:27:00]  He then proceeded to stand at the podium for an hour and took us a stab at topics such  as health care and stated he would try to stabilize the economy. 
[01:27:30]  After his speech, he stopped to find autographs for many of the lucky...  All right. 
[01:28:00]  One down, two to go.  President Obama's State of the Union address in news.  Wow.  These have to be written differently.  All right.  Next story. 
[01:28:30]  Two to go.  Big A.  Sooner be medium A.  The Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the New York Jets. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, two to stage the eighth Super Bowl appearance.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Get ready for a triple.  Oh, boy.  The Steelers' staff stomped all over their rivals in the second half 
[01:29:30]  and stood at the ground against a late-game Jets' comeback.  The final score was 24-19.  When the clock stopped, they stand and face the Packers on February 6th at the Cowboys Stadium. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's sports news.  A little sports news.  We got president, sports news.  Now let's go on a little business.  A little business news.  Okay.  Jesus, you guys are bad. 
[01:30:30]  R. Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced he will be staying home from work indefinitely earlier this month.  R. Apple's talk took a slight hit after the statement was released. 
[01:31:00]  But many believe the company who weathered the storm, while he failed to state exactly what is wrong, 
[01:31:30]  it is understood to be more than a stomach ache and a feet nose.  I hope it is not a kidney stone. 
[01:32:00]  Thanks for listening.  If I was hard to understand, it is understood. 
[01:32:30]  A Big A with the news of the day.  And you just lost another five pounds.  Congratulations.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  People want you to read lines from the King's speech.  Ah, there you go.  Can we do the King's speech with Big A? 
[01:33:00]  When the King starts speaking properly.  Yeah, we're kind of doing that.  Kind of working on that?  Okay.  For the Oscars?  All right.  That's why Big A is here.  Big A is here for another project.  But we figured if he's here, he should do a quick little newscast for us.  All right, Big A.  Big A.  Good job.  Very good job.  Excellent.  Tom Papa is here.  We'll take a break.  We'll get Tom Papa on the radio next.  A little later, Jerry Springer and Olivia Munn.  Very busy day.  This is the OPN3 Show. 
[01:33:30]  Outrageous, borderline illegal audio entertainment.  Entertainment.  The Firest.  Sirius XM.  The Firest.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B.  Anthony.  Got Tom Papa coming into the studio.  Uh, really fast.  Kyle in Canada.  Kyle.  Yeah, how you doing?  I was giving a call regarding, uh, Big A and his news.  I, every time he's on, I, I love his bits when he's on there.  And boy, do I feel like a dirtbag for laughing every time. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Well, we do too.  You are.  We made it kind of quick today.  You know, it's a, it's a quick hit.  Big A's here to, Big A's here to do something else for the Oscars.  So we figured, what the hell?  Have him do three quick news stories for everybody.  So uncomfortable.  You were very good, though, in your selection.  You know, the Steelers, the Steve Jobs.  I mean, this was smart.  Kidney stone.  You know.  State of the Union.  Stuffy nose.  Yeah.  Lucky stiffs.  Lucky stiffs.  Why would you put that in his?  I personally thought that it was, it was sweet.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  Thank you, Kyle.  I'm glad you enjoyed that.  Uh, we gotta say hi to Tom Papa.  Hi, Tom.  Tom.  Who's just that from the studio?  How are you, sir?  What's going on, Tom?  Doing good?  It's been a while.  Yeah, it has been.  How's your wife?  You've been a busy guy.  How's your life?  As you travel around, we're here every day doing the same old shit.  Every day in the same damn room.  Punch in, punch out.  Every day.  This is Groundhog Day for us, man.  It's the same shit every day.  I remember when I did.  Some of the faces changed a little bit, but.  I did Conan when he was here in New York.  Yeah.  And, you know, I was like, hey, well, thanks for having me on the show. 
[01:35:00]  And he's walking around with his guitar.  Oh.  And he's after the show.  And he said, yeah, this is a big deal for you, right?  Like, you get to come in and it's a big day.  And now I'm going to go do Conan.  He goes, and he starts, like, doing, like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And he just does this kind of manic thing on his guitar.  He's like, yeah, go ahead.  Come here.  Do your show.  Then go out about your life.  Do shows.  Travel around the country.  See your family.  I'm here every day.  In the same four walls.  Every day.  For him, it's just, yeah. 
[01:35:30]  I'm doing Conan tonight.  I am Conan.  So I do Conan every night.  Exactly.  Right.  He doesn't have to worry about being on the same four walls anymore.  Yeah, sure.  Different walls.  A couple of times.  Yeah, your wish is my command.  I'll move you everywhere.  I would love a change of scenery.  That would be awesome.  Yeah.  Well, you should change things up in here once in a while.  Oh, really?  We don't do it ourselves.  We wait for decay to change things around us.  They don't fix anything or do anything.  So slowly things fall off the wall. 
[01:36:00]  And it just gives a different environment.  This is like that show on Discovery where they show what would happen if humans left the planet.  Yeah, yeah.  And how buildings would fall down.  I think that's what they're trying with our studio.  We're doing that in real time.  Yeah.  Anthony makes a great point.  There was something hanging behind him and that's gone.  Gone, man.  And then you see a little hoarding thing happening in that corner.  We're watching that area grow out of control.  Yeah, soon there'll be a little mold man back there.  Oh, yeah.  And the equipment itself.  There's black mold coming out of these things.  This is like being in a womb after a hysterectomy. 
[01:36:30]  If that's where they're done.  I don't even know where those are performed.  In a womb.  Is it okay?  Hey, we've got to get the word out.  The big time comedy show benefit for Greg Giraldo's family.  Wow.  Yeah.  February 9th, 8 p.m. at the Beacon Theater.  You've got Tom Papa, Jim Norton, Dave Attell, Louis Black, Judy Gold, Ted Alexandro, Jesse Joyce, Colin Quinn, and Jerry Seinfeld.  All in one show.  All coming together for a great cause.  Yeah.  Ticketmaster.com for tickets?  Yeah.  Yes.  We just released a bunch of more tickets. 
[01:37:00]  It's got to be sold out.  It was.  But we just released some more tickets because we were going to film and then we decided not to.  So we have these seats that were blocked out for the cameras.  So they could.  So we've got like 200 seats left.  So we want to sell them.  So if you buy a ticket now, that's where a camera was going to be.  That's kind of special.  No, they're good.  They're good seats.  Yeah.  For sure.  You've got to think they're good seats.  Yeah.  February 9th is how long from now?  It's three weeks.  Oh, I thought it was closer.  Okay.  Oh, silly.  You crazy nut.  No, because my girlfriend keeps wanting me to fuck her.  I'm like, after the benefit.  I didn't realize it was that far away. 
[01:37:30]  Not that it matters, but I think it's two weeks at this point.  Is it two?  Yeah, I think so, right?  What's today's date?  I think we're up to 26.  26?  Two weeks.  Two weeks from tonight.  Wow, two weeks.  Close enough.  Let's see, February 1st, I think.  I've got to pay my property taxes.  You know, that's not the federal and state I just paid.  Oh, my God.  It never stops.  And then the school tax.  Then I've got to pay that.  And then it should be time again for my federal and state tax.  But I'm not paying enough, apparently.  Listen, last night at the State of the Union, I'm not paying enough taxes. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, well, yeah.  Well, you know, anybody that's making anything should give it to the rest of us.  You're penalized for achieving the American dream.  Yeah.  It's a fantastic system.  It is brutal.  Oh, you bastards.  It really is brutal.  Oh, I hate it.  I want to keep my money.  I know.  I'd like to hold on to a little of it.  You know, at some point, I'm not going to be able to fucking work.  Yeah.  And I'm just going to be hanging out going like, oh, is the next guy that did well in  his life going to support me?  Right.  Or what the fuck?  I'd rather just make my money, hold on to it, and then I'll use it to support myself 
[01:38:30]  when I get older so the government won't have to fucking take care of me.  That's the plan, but instead they want everybody to have polyester pants and eating out of  tuna cans as an old person.  That's it, because we have to take care of the people coming up, as they say.  Yeah, just like hanging out, doing nothing.  Doing nothing.  For some reason.  Well, let me bust ass and get up at four o'clock in the morning every day so you can be okay.  There seems to be this thought that the Constitution has a right to prosperity.  It's the right to achieve it and stuff, but there's no right to actually be wealthy, to 
[01:39:00]  have things.  Some people will have, some people will not have certain things.  You hope that the country offers you enough opportunity to get things, and if it does,  then you'll live in the dream that people love and this country's all about.  But if you did achieve it, you're the villain now.  You looked at like evil.  Ew, that 2%!  Did you see?  Yeah, that support the rest of the country.  Did you see how they went crazy over the guys making $150,000, building the towers?  Yeah, yeah.  Building down at Ground Zero. 
[01:39:30]  The guys are doing this major construction, this incredibly hard job that nobody could do.  And they're like, can you believe the outrage that these people are making $150,000, $170,000?  Yeah, because the guy's worked his ass off.  He's got skills.  They're probably crane operators.  And nobody else could build that.  Skills, danger.  It's like the modern-day pyramids.  It's like you're building the modern-day pyramids, and people are pissed that they're making money.  That they're making any money for it.  Are you...  What?  So should we give it to anybody? 
[01:40:00]  Just anyone?  Anyone.  Did the media not get paid when they were covering Ground Zero or September 11th?  I wonder if they all did it for free.  Playing it on a loop.  Yeah.  They kept us tuned in for a year and a half.  I guess they didn't get paid for those broadcasts.  I guess that they went down there for free on their own time off.  They did.  It was very nice.  It was very nice of them.  It's like I say, if they can't afford bread, let them eat Mrs. Fields' cookies.  Updated.  Oh, that's a good one.  I always like when you throw a new wrinkle in an oldie.  And once again, the open door on the train. 
[01:40:30]  This is what the news is talking about today, Tom Papa.  What is it?  There's going to be any panic on the train, but the train is pretty crowded.  It's standing room only.  And riders told us they had nowhere else to go.  Union representatives said that there was a malfunction with a frozen circuit.  Unless that guy is pushing people out that door.  I don't want to see it.  They're hyping this story like everyone was in danger.  Look at the guy.  He's right next to it.  He's taking a phone call.  He don't give him a fight.  It's half a door, too, that's open.  It's a careful door. 
[01:41:00]  There's not even a look.  That's very, very scary.  It's not scary.  You always get this every once in a while.  But you would think what I'm technically developed.  He looks at the psychologist from fucking Celebrity Rehab.  I think they're made in Japan, a lot of these.  I wear a safari hat in Chicago.  I wear a safari hat.  It's scaring me.  What's he doing wearing that?  It happens very rarely, according to me.  It's not on news. 
[01:41:30]  It's not accordingly.  It happens very rarely.  It happens on its own with a little push from a passenger.  That is now it's close.  It happens very disturbed by the happening as well.  They've taken that 40-year-old car out of service they're now expecting.  On the Long Island Railroad between the cars.  And this was before the between cars were closed.  Like they were just clipped together with the little chink-chink.  Right.  The chuk-chuk thing.  It was like a Western.  Yeah, it was like a Western.  We were jumping on top of the train.  And we'd go out between the two cars.  Just bounce us off.  And smoke weed.  Well, there was a platform across. 
[01:42:00]  Right.  And they fully expected you to walk.  And there was like this accordion kind of old school elevator door shutting thing.  And that was on either side.  But you were out.  And you were out in the elements.  And we used to stand there and smoke weed.  And then go back inside.  It just.  But now half a door is open and they're freaking.  The title of the news story is A Door Was A Jar Today.  That's the fucking order.  Who gives this shit?  A door was a jar today.  I can see if it was on a plane.  We felt air from the outside. 
[01:42:30]  We smelt fresh air.  It was terrible.  Oh, it was horrible.  And they just keep showing the video where no one gives a fuck.  They're still trying to make it into something.  They're literally hanging out of it.  You're caught.  No one cared.  Stop all right.  And they're interviewing people on the streets.  Showing them the video.  I know at least one person said, are you fucking kidding?  This is not interesting.  Yeah, but they certainly didn't put that on the news.  Why would you?  Did you see that YouTube the other day of the guy laying on the tracks?  Oh, God.  Yeah, he filmed himself getting run over by a train.  I thought that was fake.  No, it's not fake.  No, that was real. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, really?  You think it was fake?  No, you could do that.  I think you probably just measure.  You've got to find a spot where you.  Yeah, you can easily do that.  I mean, you've got to have balls to do it.  What, you think it's fake yet?  If it's the one I saw.  Where he lays down and the train is coming and the camera's going.  Yeah, it's facing him.  I don't think that was fake at all.  Fake?  I don't know which one.  Okay.  We've got a scoop for you.  No, I don't think it was fake.  I can't believe it's snowing again.  Every time I fly, it snows.  Where are you flying to?  Raleigh, North Carolina.  Oh, good. 
[01:43:30]  You have a little plane.  That's good.  What airline?  You going continental?  No, I think it's American.  Okay, maybe you're on an umbrella.  No, it's a bigger plane.  Is it?  Yeah.  What are you doing at Raleigh?  Good Nights?  Charlie Good Nights.  That club is great.  You like it?  Yeah, I did it recently.  It's fucking fantastic.  Really?  Yeah.  It's my first time.  I've never been there.  I'm only going to go through markets I haven't been to for a year.  Oh, that's good.  There's a couple of switchovers, like AC and whatever.  Right.  But I wanted to do a bunch of markets I haven't done. 
[01:44:00]  Shrevesport.  North Carolina ruled.  Really?  Unbelievable.  Good Nights.  Awesome.  You're going to have a good time, Tom.  Yeah, you'll sell out there.  That's good if I don't get snowed in.  Are you marriage reffing, too, still?  I just wrapped.  You just wrapped another season?  I just wrapped another season.  We start airing in May.  Fuck, how cool is that?  With either America's Got Talent or the Fat Show.  I'm trying to wait.  The Fat Show.  It's such a strange thing.  I was thinking the other day, this is what happens to your life.  It's like, I just want to be on TV.  And you get something, and then things, you're like, well, if we're with America, if America's 
[01:44:30]  Got Talent or The Biggest Loser, it's like, why should those shows matter to my life?  But they're really important.  Which one would you rather have?  Right, exactly.  I don't know.  America's Got Talent.  That's bigger, right?  Yeah, America's Got Talent.  Yeah, they get really good numbers.  What kind of celebrities you got this coming season?  Bill Maher.  Ugh.  Tracy.  Tracy Morgan, Mary J. Blige, Julianne Moore, Ricky Gervais.  Some good ones.  How was Tracy? 
[01:45:00]  Hilarious.  Of course he was.  He just sits there and just throws comedy Molotov cocktails.  Just unrelated.  Just starts, just yells shit out.  He says whatever he wants.  Whatever he wants.  Did he talk about Planet of the Apes?  He didn't.  Oh, gosh.  He went on a Mandingo run.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which we had to edit back a little bit.  I was talking about Planet of the Apes for an hour and just make it fucking the funniest  shit you've ever heard.  He did a run on Josie Wales.  Josie Wales? 
[01:45:30]  There was some guy that was dressed like a Revolutionary War guy.  And he's like, he's up there dressed like Josie Wales.  He's the outlaw Josie Wales.  He's a red coat.  Josie Wales?  Josie Wales on the red coat?  No, the red coat.  No, the red coat.  Exactly.  Josie Wales.  That was Josie Wales.  What a great reference.  I know.  And I didn't relate at all.  The guy who spits?  Josie Wales?  He does it.  And he says everything three times. 
[01:46:00]  Josie Wales?  Yeah, I think the guy that was chasing him was red legs.  So then he probably got a red coat.  Yeah, whatever his mind does.  Yeah, try and piece that together.  That's what he does.  A weird road map.  How was Gervais?  It was great, right?  Gervais was great.  Yeah.  He just starts, whatever he's on, he just starts drinking at the beginning of it.  By the end, he's hammered.  That's fantastic.  Like the first act, he was like, oh, he's pretty funny.  By the end, he was hilarious.  And on his third thing appeared.  I did not know he was a drinker.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:46:30]  Ricky?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, even in his specials, he always has the big pint with him.  Oh, you're right.  You know what?  He drinks pints on stage.  Yeah.  Last time I saw him, he was just pounding pints.  He pounds.  In the Golden Globes, he popped one up right there on the podium.  Yeah, even at the Golden Globes, you could hear by the end, he's like very breathy.  Yeah, yeah.  This is how funny he is.  I'm sorry, how smart he is.  I saw him at the Garden, like 5,000 seat venue, whatever that is, at Paramount.  Yeah.  And he has this, he comes out and it's his Ricky and he's dressed like a king. 
[01:47:00]  It's really funny.  But he has this podium where he keeps his pint, but you can't see the back of it.  And I'm like, that genius, he probably has notes back there.  Yeah.  Because you can't see it.  I was like, what a smart fucking guy.  Yeah.  I'm so dumb trying to fucking have Kenny light his stupid face at 30 so I know what I'm doing an hour.  Is that what you're doing?  Is that what you're doing?  Dude, I tie myself the same way fucking medieval comedians would have a moron light himself.  A torch waving a medieval torch. 
[01:47:30]  Don't you get that panic like when you don't, where is he?  Where am I?  How much time do I have left?  The worst is when you think like, I've been up here for a long time.  I'm running out of material.  Then he lights his face.  I'm like, oh my God, I'm only at 30.  I have an hour.  I know.  What's worse is when the audience goes, wow, he's been up there a long time.  And you're at 10 minutes.  Just do what Patrice does and don't leave no matter what they do.  Just sit there.  The light's flashing on him.  Don't move at all.  No, he won't leave. 
[01:48:00]  He lights his face.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, he does.  I don't like when they flashlight at you because it's distracting to the audience.  Right.  But he just lights that fucking Boris Karloff face in the back with a flashlight.  It's so spooky.  The audience gets up with pitchforks and torches and chases him.  Do you have to nod that you saw?  Yeah, because obviously otherwise I've looked over five minutes later and he's still lit.  It's like, I got it, you fucking Halloween decoration.  He's on fire.  Yeah, actually light your head on fire next time.  Dummy.  Yeah, Kenny, do it. 
[01:48:30]  Well, his hair's dry enough to do that, so.  Fucking hay hair.  Hay head.  Put a stick in your ass and somersault through the room quickly.  That's how I know I'm at 30.  Creep.  Just start attacking a woman when I hear her scream.  Yes.  Bludgeoning her with a chair.  I'm happy Colin's on this gig.  I actually haven't seen Colin in a while since the premiere.  I know.  Who has?  Who has?  He's in the basement of the Hellen A's Theater every night.  He's still going?  He's a big star.  Yeah, he goes till March 6th.  Extended till March 6th.  Extended till March 6th.  Extended till March 6th.  Extended till March 6th.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  You think he's sick of it by now?  Yeah.  We've talked to some of these Broadway guys and it's the same shit.  Every day.  At least we talk about different stuff every day.  He's not talking about different stuff every day.  And he's alone.  And he's just sitting there by himself.  He got extended to?  Yeah, yeah.  Till March?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, he's a success.  He's a Broadway hit.  That's great.  I'm a big success.  And then eventually they're going to move him to other cities and possibly cross the pond.  They're going to shoot it for HBO.  Jesus.  And they're going to hold on to that while he goes on tour with it. 
[01:49:30]  And then once he's done with the tour, release it on HBO.  Wow.  Good for fucking Colin.  And then he'll do his next one.  Ah, enough with Colin.  He's gotten every break.  It's rare that I'm literally that happy for somebody.  I know.  Of all the comics, we always kind of have like a, we're happy for each other, but we're not.  But with Colin, I think every comic is happy when he gets something good.  Because it's like, you know, he deserves it.  Everyone knows how good he is.  Yeah, because he's so old now.  Yeah.  And he's so old, he can't do it for that long.  You've still got time to pass him by.  Here's my dream. 
[01:50:00]  Here's my dream.  That Colin shoots the special.  It's nominated for an Emmy.  And the night before the Emmys, he drops dead in his hotel room with a fucking tranny and a crack pipe.  Long story short.  And he gets it posthumously.  Oh, God.  He's found with his finger in his face.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, would that give me pleasure amid scandalous stories coming out?  Oh, of course.  Oh, finally successful, and he doesn't get to enjoy it. 
[01:50:30]  All the Broadway stars come to his funeral.  Yeah, they dim the lights on Broadway.  Yeah, they dim the lights on Broadway.  For Colin.  Al Pacino.  In front of the Helen Hayes Theater.  I know.  They're just, ah, not the whole, we can't dim the whole street.  It's just Colin.  Just dim one at the fucking pizza place.  Just think about what Al Pacino, Al Pacino's show is right across the street from it.  King Lear.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  He comes in and has to see Colin Quinn.  What the hell?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Long story short. 
[01:51:00]  Short, is that a jab at me?  Who is this guy?  It's great for Colin.  It sucks for Pacino.  That's right.  Every day Colin walks in, yep, me and Pacino.  Yeah, as Pacino, you've got to kind of want to think, hey, I've achieved something.  I'm doing King Lear on Broadway.  And then he looks and goes, oh, look who else they give a show to.  Colin Quinn.  Right.  Who is this asshole? 
[01:51:30]  If you worked a day in your life.  Oh, one of his best performances, right?  One of his best performances, right?  Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.  I saw that on Broadway, actually, with Alan Alda.  And I actually preferred Lemon's performance.  He was in it, Lee Shriver, fucking Jeffrey Tambor, I think, was in it.  That's a weird cast.  One of the Dukes of Hazzard, not Tom Wopat.  Tom Wopat was in it.  The other guy?  Yeah, Tom Wopat was in it.  Tom Wopat.  Oh, my Lord.  It was good, though.  It was really good on Broadway. 
[01:52:00]  They didn't have Roscoe in there, too?  Yeah.  There's a lot of Broadway, that guy, right?  Yeah.  Tom Wopat.  Yeah, he's a Broadway guy.  He's like a revival guy.  He does all those revival, like Annie Get Your Gun.  He's always doing a Western dance with a bunch of gay cowboys behind him.  That's right.  Starring Tom Wopat and Bernadette Peters.  It's got to be some dressing room.  The New York Times calls it the number one revival of the year. 
[01:52:30]  It's Oklahoma.  Now starring Colin Quinn.  Oklahoma.  Where the wind comes, I don't know, something.  He's like one of those guys from South Philly.  When you're a jet, you're a jet all the way.  I guess so.  I guess so.  If you're a Dominican, I don't know what the hell.  Like a bunch of Puerto Ricans are going to dance and not stab you.  Colin Quinn in West Side Story.  When you're a jet, I guess. 
[01:53:00]  I guess you're a jet all the way.  White guy and a white girl with a Puerto Rican, of course, there's problems.  God forbid we show who's really the problem.  Oh, he is a shithead. 
[01:53:30]  I love how we started off with, that's the one guy I'm really happy for.  Now we're trying to mail cancer to him.  Colin's a bum.  Oh, shit.  That's funny.  What do you guys do to a guy you hate, man?  That's what I want to know.  Jesus.  Being attacked by Tom Wolcott. 
[01:54:00]  Wolcott.  Tom Wolcott.  Wolcott.  Oh, God.  Wow.  He's the other guy from Wham!  As far as Dukes of Hazzard went.  Tom Wolcott.  Yeah.  Yeah, the second guy that no one remembers.  The other guy's not working, though, right?  He's the DJ Jazzy Jeff.  Who's the other guy?  Is the other guy working, though?  Who?  What's his name?  George Michael?  No, no, no, no.  No, the other guy from Dukes of Hazzard.  Is he working?  George Snyder.  But he doesn't work.  He did...  He's on tour with the guy from Bosom Buddies.  He was on Smallville for a while.  Oh, right.  That's right. 
[01:54:30]  He gets, like, some TV work and shit.  Yeah.  Oh, the guy from Bosom...  They're on the Let's Hang Ourselves This Year tour.  Oh, my God.  The guy from Bosom Buddies.  What did he do to Tom Hanks?  Did Tom Hanks...  Would he, like, put, like, fucking...  Boy, this better be funny.  I wouldn't hold your breath, though, folks.  Oh, no.  All right.  Let it rip.  I'm just saying, for Hanks to have gone on to such an Oscar-winning career, like, and  him to have...  I saw him at a Starbucks on, like, 72nd Street. 
[01:55:00]  For that Bosom Buddies show?  Yeah.  The other guy, yeah.  Is he doing Broadway?  Has he done anything?  Was he making lattes?  No, but he should have been.  He was fucking...  Oof.  Oh, that poor bastard.  You could have watched that show back then and just been like, these guys will just go  nowhere.  Yeah, too horrible.  And Tom Hanks ends up, you know...  One and done, right?  The fucking huge star that he is.  You ever see him in Taxi?  Tom Hanks, his episode of Taxi?  Yeah.  It's a very funny flashback episode where Jim shows you when he was in Harvard University  and how he first tried drugs and Tom Hanks was one of the guys at the parties. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, and he was the very studious...  Yeah, but Hanks was, like, all high at the party.  He was actually very funny.  Yeah.  He took one hit of a joint and made the face came up.  He's like, Heather, drugs are very addicting.  Some people get it.  Who knows?  I could be one of those people.  It was really fucking funny.  That Taxi was a great show, man.  Oh, it was great.  Tom Hanks was also on an episode of the...  Which one was that?  Family Ties.  Family Ties, and he played the drunk.  The drunk uncle, yeah. 
[01:56:00]  What?  He played the drunk uncle.  I don't remember that.  He had an alcohol problem.  He was always the fun guy.  And then they realized, like, uh-oh, he's got a problem.  That's what a very special episode when they decided sitcoms needed to tell a message.  Oh, but it's pretty amazing that you remember him in all these just one-offs on these shows.  But, like, there's definitely a reason that guy is what he is.  You know what I mean?  I mean, yeah.  You watch him in movies now, Apollo 13, and not even now, years ago, but Philadelphia.  It's like, wow, he's a real actor.  Yeah, right, yeah.  Look at that. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And he started off doing just goofy shit.  Oh, and the poor was a buddy guy, because it's like, he's got to watch him just succeed  every year, get bigger and bigger.  Just holding an Oscar, and you and that are going, I remember we used to come in and go,  hey, we got this show.  This is so cool.  Oh, yeah, me and you, man.  Me and you.  Yeah, what happened?  It must be so uncomfortable for Tom when he sees him.  Right.  Like, hey.  Hey.  Oh.  What's going on with you?  Knowing he could help him out, and he never did.  Stop.  Never said, hey, can you help out, Peter? 
[01:57:00]  I think his name's Peter, right?  Can't you throw him some?  I think it's Peter Scolari or something.  I think it's Peter Scolari or something.  Can't you have him get shot in Private Ryan or something?  Yeah, can't you do something?  Someone in the background getting his head vaporized on the beach?  Could it be an extra, at least?  Well, I would.  A dead body that I walk over?  It's not up to me.  The producers, you know.  I'm only a double Oscar winner.  I have no pull.  I have no pull in this business.  Stop by the castle sometime.  What are you doing?  What about Apollo 13?  Aren't you producing that?  Yeah, but producing, it's really just a title.  Casting.  The casting people.  Yeah.  You know, once you get this far, it's out of your hands, man. 
[01:57:30]  Remember when our bras got mixed up that time?  That was fun.  I gotta go.  Yeah.  You think security stops him as he's trying to get on set of stuff?  I just want to say hi to Tom.  You know.  Tom's practicing for his scene right now.  So, did you hear about Wendy Jo Sperber's tits?  I mean, go on.  Oh, God.  I'm just saying things they'd say to me.  Do you think he's got a clip of the show on his iPhone and he plays it to the security  people when he's trying to see Tom Hanks?  Look.  We were in a show together.  They just get sad for him. 
[01:58:00]  We see that every day.  We see that every day.  You got iMovie, too.  Good for you.  Show the clip of you accepting an Oscar.  Oh, don't have one, do you?  Yeah, you're going to have to.  Show us something from the 90s.  Don't have it.  You know when he sees Hanks, he just wants to go, look, help me.  Help me.  For Christ's sake, help me.  Don't even put me in anything.  Just give me some money.  Just write a check right now.  Just give me a bag of money.  I don't care.  He looks at fucking Hanks the way he'd hate. 
[01:58:30]  He looked at the U.S. after the quake.  Help.  Say anything.  In the credits of a movie, it's just check 1204 written to.  Right.  We got an update on Peter Scolari from Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin, go ahead.  I hope this is true, by the way.  He's gone.  And he hung up.  Supposedly he's doing a commercial on XM.  Some kind of dick cream or dick hardening thing.  No way.  I don't know if it's true.  No way.  Come on.  Can we try to find that?  No way.  I bet he's grabbed Tom Hanks' lapels at least once, but not angrily, just out of desperation. 
[01:59:00]  Like, yeah, it's all right.  Tom's like, you doing some theater?  He's like, yeah.  Tom times with the top.  He just grabs it.  He says, Tom, I need work.  Tom.  I'll do anything.  I'll suck your dick, man.  Oh, God.  This week in Branson, Missouri, Peter Scolari.  In long story short.  Long story short.  Colin Frans.  Colin decides to retire.  Yeah, Peter Scolari's taking it.  You know, the other bosom buddy wasn't available. 
[01:59:30]  Big man.  I want the other fucking bosom buddy.  I just want to slap Colin's face.  He can't even climb up the steps.  He's just going.  He is.  Oh, okay.  He is slappable.  We got more info coming in on Peter Scolari.  Peter Scolari.  Let's say hi to this guy.  What do you got, sir?  I'm Peter Scolari.  I am Peter Scolari.  I am Peter Scolari.  Or is it Scolari?  I don't know.  What do you got?  Whatever. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, what do you got?  Jesus Christ, dude.  Sorry about that.  Sorry.  They've been running commercials on XM for the last three weeks with Peter Scolari plugging  the Boston Medical Group to get your dick hard.  Really?  Wow.  Do we have that?  No.  Come on.  It can't be.  We're looking for it.  Okay.  Does he say hi, I'm Peter Scolari?  Absolutely.  Not all of us can get a hard on by thinking about when we used to work with Tom Hanks.  Other people did this.  Oh, wow.  That's terrible.  Have you met him?  I wonder what Tom Hanks is doing while he's doing those commercials. 
[02:00:30]  Tom Hanks.  What do you think Tom Hanks is doing?  Reading more fucking potential Oscar winners?  Oh, my Lord.  Scripts for an Oscar?  Didn't he just do a series?  I keep watching The Road to Perdition.  Yeah.  That's what you told about, right?  Yeah.  We were talking about it last night.  It's so good.  I didn't see it.  I think that movie.  It's Hanks in a hat with a gun.  Very film noir looking.  It is.  It's really.  It's like one of those that you keep watching and it just keeps getting better.  I think Tom Hanks movies are probably the most rewatchable movies.  I've probably seen Apollo 13 8,000 times. 
[02:01:00]  It's Saving Private Ryan.  Yeah.  You just watch these things over and over again.  Over and over.  And Peter Scalera is doing dick cream.  The man with one red shoe.  I mean, who can get enough?  Joe versus the volcano.  Money Pit.  He did go through a phase where it could have gone either way.  He could have been one of those 80s stars that you went like, oh, remember him?  He did that show and then he was in some movies and now he's doing commentary on a VH1 clip show. 
[02:01:30]  But the short guy's good in that Saving Private Ryan.  Peter Scalera, you see him?  He was so fucking believable.  I want to hear this commercial now.  When Joe the Volcano came out, Peter was just like, maybe this will do it.  Peter Scalera's like, I'll see you on the beaches.  All right, everybody.  And there's fucking Tom Hanks.  You could get a heart on if you rub this cream on your dick.  I've got to hear the commercial.  Where is it? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, that's terrible.  You can't find it yet?  But how would he...  We'll wrap up this nice break.  But how would he promote himself as, like...  He just says, hi, I'm Peter Scalera.  Yeah, he'd have to say his name.  But, yeah.  With no credit, you think?  With no credit.  And you know, some people suffer from erectile dysfunction.  Yeah, he'll keep you clinical.  It's probably a class act.  Like my career.  Some of your dicks might be just like my career.  Droopy, soft, and useless.  Yes, I've been shoving Cialis in my agent's phone for 20 years. 
[02:02:30]  Still can't get it up.  Why don't we just look him up?  Danny, can you look up Peter Scalera?  He's been, yeah.  Oh, okay.  He has been looking for the commercial.  Oh, okay.  Is he doing any gigs or anything, though?  Like, when does his IMBD...  IMBD.  That's what he's on.  IMBD.  That's his problem.  Oh, God.  What's he done lately?  Let's see.  It's post-production.  Something in there.  Has he really?  One summer.  Suburban Cial. 
[02:03:00]  Who's Father McGarry in Cathedral Pines?  We all remember that.  American Dad.  He played himself as the limo driver.  He was a seminary teacher in Big Love.  Big Love.  Big Love.  Polar Express.  Polar Express.  Hey, wait a minute.  Now, Polar Express.  Hey, that was Hank's thing.  Tom Hanks in it.  Here we go.  We got a connection.  So he threw him a ball.  Oh, and he played the Lonely Boy, which is a pretty big role.  Was it?  Kind of.  Kind of.  Not quite the conductor.  It was a day of voiceovers for him.  It wasn't exactly Santa Claus. 
[02:03:30]  Tom probably couldn't even come in that day to say hi to him.  Yeah, just drive to the studio.  Do some voiceover.  I'm not going to be able to make it.  It was probably some second unit stuff.  It was originally Boy, number one.  Just change it to Lonely Boy.  Make it look like a real role.  It was Kyle Evans on one episode of ER.  Oh, I know that.  He was in one episode of The King of Queens.  He was on Reba.  Allie McBeal.  We're going back.  Touched by an angel.  2001 was a little slow.  Peter's got something on Peter Scalera. 
[02:04:00]  Honey, I shrunk the kids in a TV show.  Yeah, Tom Hanks did put him in a movie.  He put him in that thing you do.  He played like the Ed Sullivan type talk show guy.  So he puts him in all his shitty projects.  That's nice of him.  He doesn't have that much confidence in the guy.  That was 1996, by the way.  If you could carry my red shoe.  Let's go to Jackie in Jersey.  Jackie.  First guy.  I mean, the guy was on Newhart for seven years.  He did nothing after Bosom Buddies.  Oh, was he? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, he was the husband.  Right.  He was the husband for seven years.  Why are you ruining our bitch?  I stand corrected.  This has been a great half hour.  But I want to say, in the commercial, he identifies himself.  This is Peter Scalera, your old bosom buddy.  Oh.  Well, thank God he's not doing breast cancer awareness ads by saying that.  This is Wendy Gillesperva, your bosom buddy. 
[02:05:00]  Okay.  Oh, no.  You did not say that.  I didn't say anything.  Everyone misheard.  Over all of the talking.  Oh, yeah.  Now I got to hear this commercial.  Your old bosom buddy.  Oh, boy.  That's terrible.  Danny's working on it.  So is E-Rock.  You can't find the system?  They've been playing it for three months.  It's a paycheck.  You know.  Still looking for it.  Show business is hard. 
[02:05:30]  I have to go to Raleigh.  Yeah, Raleigh.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Peter Scalera wishes he was Rob Schneider.  Oh.  Whoa.  Oh, now.  Come on.  Oh, jeepers.  I saw Rob Schneider leave the Hugh Hefner roast with one of Hugh's blondes.  And then got the blonde fired.  You can do it.  Yeah, see?  Isn't that weird?  Hugh, you can do it.  It's probably why they invited him.  Just to say that.  Hugh can do it.  Hugh can do it.  It's a schedule.  All right.  Get the fuck out of here.  Get the you can do it guy.  More info coming in.  We got Andrew. 
[02:06:00]  Andrew.  Andrew.  Andrew.  You know what?  You guys didn't know he played Wilson in Castaway.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't know that.  In what?  In Castaway.  Wilson in Castaway.  Well, yeah.  Much like in Lord of the Rings, where the actor played Gollum and then they later superimposed  him with Gollum.  He played the soccer ball to give Tom someone to talk to.  Yeah, yeah.  And they later.  He just made him lay around day after day.  Dressed as a soccer ball.  He was in the studio with all those green screen things all over his face.  You sure, Tom?  We need to do this? 
[02:06:30]  No, really.  It's your expressions.  I need to look at Wilson.  Give us a sad face.  Think about bosom buddies.  That's his natural face.  Oh, God.  Oh, this poor bastard.  Oh, he has just...  And it's actually, it is in all honesty, it's not a bad career.  He works every year.  At least he gets a little something.  Every year he gets something.  He gets his insurance every year.  That's what it is.  But if it wasn't, if his bosom buddy wasn't Tom Hanks, it would, that's what kills it.  Exactly.  It just happened to be like, yeah, Tom Hanks. 
[02:07:00]  If it was Joey Lawrence, no one would fucking give a shit.  You know what's humiliating is that we're here destroying his career and he has so much  a better career than I do.  Oh, completely.  Two series.  But you didn't work with Tom Hanks.  That's true.  Right, exactly.  You worked with Colin.  That's the thing that kills us.  Yeah, you work with Colin.  You guys are neck and neck.  Look, you know, we've come full circle.  When you used to call him my show.  Well, you know, folks, a lot of times, he just doesn't say anything.  Does he bite his finger a lot in the show? 
[02:07:30]  No.  I don't think he does.  I think it's an equity rule that he can't.  That he can't do it.  I still have not seen the show.  It's really good, dude.  You haven't seen it?  No.  I would actually go see it.  It's a great date so I can get free tickets.  I want to wait until he gets completely sick and has no passion left and then see it.  You should have seen him in 1980 then.  Oh, shit, Colin, he nailed you.  You should go.  What you really should go is he didn't want to do a Sunday matinee show because it's not that crowd. 
[02:08:00]  Everyone's a thousand years old.  So he does three shows on Saturday.  Does he really?  Three.  Wow.  But you have to do that.  Did he do a matinee and then two?  You have to do a certain amount of shows a week.  And he didn't want to do a Sunday so he threw one on Saturday.  He figured, well, that'd be more of my audience.  But you know, when you're a starting comic, after your first year, you're like, I'm not doing three shows because it's impossible.  You're just hallucinating up there.  And he's the furthest thing from a starting comic.  And to have to do matinees, it's basically, it's like to do stand-up type material in the afternoon. 
[02:08:30]  In the afternoon with all these old women in the audience.  Yeah, yeah.  But no, he said that's what really kills him is doing the, if you go do the, if you want to fun, you should go to the third one on Saturday.  I'll go to the third Saturday show.  What times are they?  Miserable.  Eight and ten or something or eight and ten thirty?  It's probably.  Oh, seven.  And it's probably crowds, really.  It's probably, yeah.  And it's only an hour show.  They should just Disney animatronic.  They turn that crowd around quickly.  Hour fifteen, yeah.  Get some animatronic Colin to get up there, like at Disney, Hall of Presidents. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Fucking, yeah, well, you know.  See, the hard thing is because they have, they have cues and they have lighting cues and they have, it's very actually well produced and well done, which means that he can't just keep going.  Because Colin will just go off book and off road.  Right, right.  But you can't do that unless the lighting guy is right, right with you.  Wow, that's got to drive him crazy.  Exactly, not being able to really, yeah.  Does he, is he able to go out and like work on new stuff?  Does he have time to go to the cellar or anything?  No.  He doesn't have time to even. 
[02:09:30]  He's exhausted.  Oh my God.  I'm sure he does.  I'm sure he'll do like a new line once in a while.  I'm sure he writes new pieces for you a little bit.  In a mirror at his house.  Yeah.  Looking in the mirror.  Holding a shotgun like a microphone.  He throws a line or two in.  He updates.  Yeah.  I saw him update a little bit last time I saw him.  Yeah.  I've seen it a couple times though.  Oh yeah?  Oh yeah, it's great.  It's great, isn't it?  You went?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw it a couple times too.  It's really strong.  And I like the changes they made from when he was way off Broadway to fucking Broadway.  It really became like a real thing.  Yeah, like what the fuck? 
[02:10:00]  This is a real thing now.  Real show.  Not a guy running to the back to start the projector for Colin.  I know.  I was there when in June and July there was no air conditioning.  Right.  The air conditioning broke.  Colin's just sweating.  Dude, it was in a theater where the guy taking your tickets was the guy that was running  the projector.  Right.  So we're all sitting there like, well, why isn't the show starting?  Because the guy has to close up the box office.  And he's running up the stairs.  And you see him run up the stairs to start the show.  That's how he started.  And now, man, it's...  Now he's a Broadway star.  And now he's got a lot of people behind him.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  It's a great name for it, too.  And it's just easy to remember.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's fucking...  I'm so happy he got extended.  Yeah.  Having Jerry involved doesn't hurt.  Doesn't hurt at all.  Yeah, that obviously helps a lot.  Sure.  It gave people...  I think having Seinfeld...  It didn't make people laugh.  Because, you know, you're either going to like this show or you're not.  But it gave...  It kind of forced critics to at least look at it honestly.  Right, right, right.  And they can't bash it once they look at it.  No, it's too smart.  It's too smart.  When we get the plug in, we're going to take a break.  We got Jerry Springer coming in in a few minutes.  You sticking around, Tom? 
[02:11:00]  Whatever you'd like.  I'd love to stay.  All right, good.  Tom Papa is here.  And he's going to be part of the big-time comedy show benefit for Greg Giraldo's family.  That's two weeks from tonight, February 9th.  The Beacon Theater.  Tickets still available.  Just a few, though, because they released some.  So you're going to want to get those immediately.  Ticketmaster.com.  You got Papa.  You got Norton.  You got Attel.  Louis Black.  Judy Gold.  Ted Alexandro.  The list goes on and on.  Colin Quinn.  Jerry Seinfeld.  It's going to be an amazing night of comedy.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  And it's a great cause, obviously.  Great show.  So, yeah, all the money goes to Greg Giraldo's family.  What about people that can't go to the show? 
[02:11:30]  Is there another way they could donate to Giraldo's family?  Do you know what I can?  Yes, they can.  I don't know exactly how they would do that.  All right, maybe we'll try to get that info out there for everybody.  Just send it to me.  I'll take care of you.  You're going to get it to us.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On the virus.  The Sirius XM.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hanging with Tom Papa today.  By the way, if you're not going to make the Greg Giraldo fundraiser slash comedy show. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, hold on.  There you are.  GregGiraldo.com.  You could donate, which would be very good.  Yeah.  Family needs money, man.  All the info is right there on the website.  GregGiraldo.com.  You know what sucks?  Crazy.  It's so hard to watch the roasts that he's on.  I know.  And he's so fucking good on them, but I was just watching the David Hasselhoff roast.  And, you know, it's funny shit.  And then it's like, oh, here comes Greg.  And it's like, ah, guy. 
[02:12:30]  I know.  Oh, it's brutal.  He's so funny.  And now it's depressing.  Yeah.  I've been doing these interviews and watching clips of him.  And, you know, we're going to run some of his stuff at the event, too.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to do this, you know, like five minute video thing with all his best stuff.  And you're just like working on it, working on it.  And then all of a sudden you sit there and you're like, fuck, he's gone.  That sucks.  He's gone.  It's insane.  It really is.  Really awful.  And you can name 20 other comics that should have went.  Absolutely.  It's like, God damn.  I know.  Fuck, man. 
[02:13:00]  My mother-in-law keeps going.  This evil person.  It really is.  Just no justice.  Says nothing funny ever.  Never smiles.  Just keeps plowing.  Miserable people.  Not a fan, are you?  The mother-in-law?  The worst.  The worst.  Just awful.  Just getting in your face.  That attic breath.  Just mean.  You know, so, you know, and I always feel kind of bad about it.  Like, saying that an old lady is mean and nasty. 
[02:13:30]  But, you know, you see old crinkled up ladies.  You think, oh, she must come with cookies.  A sweet old lady.  Yeah, she probably just bakes cookies for people.  No.  If you're an idiot when you're young, you don't get old.  You don't just start becoming nice when your hips start going.  You get angrier.  Now you're a nasty old bitter person.  Now you're worse than ever.  Yeah, because it added in the bitterness of being old.  Yeah.  And regrets.  Yeah.  And pains.  Lost fucking opportunities. 
[02:14:00]  Basically what you're saying is some old people deserve their hips being broken.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  A good slip on the ice.  You're not supposed to be sad for every old person that breaks a hip.  That's shivering like a pop bottle.  Some of them had it coming for many fucking years, man.  Some deserve it.  Fuck them.  Absolutely.  What else is going on?  Creep.  What else is going on?  Peanut brittle hips.  What else is going on in your world, man?  What's on your radar?  Anything in the news?  Movies? 
[02:14:30]  Other TV shows?  I'm trying to catch up on all the Oscar films now that they're all out.  Yeah, I think we all do that, right?  Yeah, I just saw The Black Swan.  Not one black person in it, by the way.  No.  Not one.  Racist.  Yeah.  Was it a good movie?  It was good.  We're trying to figure out if we should see that.  It's sexy.  That's some sexiness in it.  But it's ballerina shit.  Yeah, but there's some lesbian scenes and a little masturbation shit.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good scene.  Sounds very saucy.  I like to think, I don't watch a lot of movies, especially a lot of Oscar-nominated movies, 
[02:15:00]  so I always like to think that the one or two I saw are the ones like, I'm like, oh  yeah, that one's hands down.  That's got to be the one that wins everything.  Like right now, I'm on a true grit fucking juggernaut.  I know this film's going to run away with it because I've seen no other movie.  And you're not going to see The King's Speech?  No!  No!  Why would you?  I saw it.  I saw it.  It was good, right?  I heard it was good.  It's good, but it's also, you're watching it and you're like, oh, this is made to win  awards.  Yes! 
[02:15:30]  It's got an affliction.  It's got accents.  It's a period.  Real actors.  Real actors.  Real costumes.  Real actors.  Who's that homeless guy?  What?  It's really good.  Oh, Springer.  Oh, my God.  That's Jerry Springer.  Oh, that was Springer.  He looked very confused outside the studio.  And then he just walked away.  Where's he going?  I don't know.  He's giving a final thought to somebody.  By Shane 45, because of his audience.  Hey, why don't we know anything about this king?  I've never heard of this king before.  I know.  With the speech impediment.  That's funny.  He did nothing with his fucking king shit. 
[02:16:00]  That was Queen Elizabeth's husband.  Yeah.  Exactly.  What's his name?  I had no idea.  King George VI.  King George VI.  It was one of those things where you're watching Nazi sympathizers.  You're trying to pretend that you knew everything.  Oh, well, yeah.  I kind of know this guy.  Then you realize, I know nothing.  The man who identifies himself as the king is not allowed to stutter through this speech.  You'll not see Jerry Langford again.  It's really, it's so, and it's, you know, you can't really watch a guy stuttering without  laughing.  Yes.  Thank you.  Of course. 
[02:16:30]  It's the funniest affliction there is.  We just did that on our show with Big A doing the news.  We put him on so you laugh a little bit and get uncomfortable.  Big A's, it starts funny and then gets very uncomfortable.  Yes.  And that's exactly what we were going for.  It had to have been like a stuttering caveman.  Like, it had to go back to the point.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And it goes, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And it just laughed at him and he cries.  And then a fucking tiger eats him. 
[02:17:00]  Dinosaur.  He's trying to tell him a saber dude tiger's coming into the cave and all the children get  eaten.  Fire.  Fire.  Look, he can't even talk.  He can't tell me.  Or he panics and throws water on it.  And then for 300 more years, people just die at night.  Thanks for the stuttering, panicking idiot.  Stuttering through history.  A long story short. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, well.  History of the world in 70 minutes or an hour 20.  Whatever.  It all depends.  Where's the Springer?  He's going to the bathroom  Oh yeah, he's the drop of deuce  He can't hold his urine, he's too old  He's probably shitting straight leg  He needs another show idea  So he's going to look in the toilet  Even he'd agree to that  Wasn't it voted worst TV show ever 
[02:18:00]  By TV Guide  Of course  But it was  Worst show in history of television  By TV Guide in 2002  20 years he's been doing the Jerry Springer show  And I want to know if he's bitter  Because Nick Cannon took his fucking job on  America's Got Talent  I think he knows  Whenever he gets another gig  It's like so temporary  Everything's temporary  Jerry's got a lot of the ups and downs  But that show  That's his  Mediocre  Yeah, go  That's his straight line  Last time he was in  He basically hinted that he hates doing that fucking show 
[02:18:30]  Really?  But it's his gig now  Yeah  He's had it  He's had it  It really is  He can't really branch out into anything else  After 20 years  There he is  A little cup of coffee  He's paying for the house  Let's get Jerry in here  Where are we putting Jerry?  What's he signing?  Oh, a release?  For what?  Is he signing a check to a hooker?  We all remember that little gag  Jerry, what are you  Jerry!  What are you  Don't get up  Jerry Springer  What are you signing, Jerry?  That's release 
[02:19:00]  A release  Oh, a release  You've got to keep everything legal  So you can use this over  Jerry's looking good  You are looking good, Jerry  Look healthy, my friend  God damn  Jerry Springer  In the house  Oh my gosh  You haven't been here in a while  We scared you  I haven't  Nah  No, it's just  It's so expensive to fly in  Is that what it is?  Yeah  He doesn't want to do this show  Oh God  I don't play Jerry  No, I do  No, what are we talking?  20  20 years  Doing the Jerry Springer show  20 years 
[02:19:30]  Wow  20 years  There's no excuse for it  No  I'm taking this opportunity to apologize  No apology needed, sir  I've ruined the culture  We, uh  No, you affected a culture  That's for sure  Yeah  Do you ever think  Do you ever think about that?  Petri dished  Do you ever think about that?  Pardon?  Do you ever think about how you  Might have had an impact on  On actual  Civilization  Or uncivilization  Whatever you want  I try not to  You try not to really think of that?  Well, Western Civilization has been around for a while  You know, it's time to give Eastern Civilization a shot 
[02:20:00]  Yeah  So I thought I'd bring it down  But like people, you know  Socrates and Plato and stuff have affected cultures  Do you feel like you're  Well, when you think Socrates and Plato and Springer  Springer  It all rolls  Sounds like a law firm  People with their togas falling off  Beating each other up  During an accident  Call Socrates, Plato and Springer  They have to pixelate a toga slipping off a tit  Because one woman's beating somebody over some  Philosophy  Yeah, it's  You probably could put out a show in a time capsule 
[02:20:30]  And it probably would be as instructive  As watching news things for the last 20 years  Did you get annoyed that people would blame you for things  So like  It's like you really were in a lot of ways  Just showing people  You weren't forcing people to act a certain way  But people would somehow blame you  Because people were acting like assholes on the show  But that's not your fault  I mean  Yeah, no  Unless they were talking about Jerry  No, I guess you know  I've never taken the show seriously  So, you know  I never take the 
[02:21:00]  It shows  Compliment  Yeah  I mean, I never take the compliment seriously  And I never take  Oh, I mean  To heart  And I don't take the criticism  I mean, it's a stupid show  And that's all it is  But it's fun to watch  I mean  If I  I wouldn't watch it  But, you know  I'm 67  Like if I were in college  I'd watch it  Now, it's still a certain age group  And I get it  With 20 years in though  You look back 20 years ago  You got criticized for a lot of things  That the mainstream news media now  Is doing  Sensationalizing stuff 
[02:21:30]  Oh, that was always hypocritical  But you kind of knew it at the time  I mean  You know  They  They would say how terrible it is  And then all evening  Up until the 11 o'clock news  They would promo  Scenes from the fighting on the show  Right, right  Tonight at 11  We're going to be talking to the guy  You know  To get people to watch  They kept showing the  So, of course  That was hypocritical  Yeah, they love the sensationalism  That comes along with it  You know  20 years  When did you do anything on the air?  Anything on the air  Anything on the air 
[02:22:00]  For 20 years  Well, because it's got a niche  Yeah  And it also appeals to younger people  And if you have a show  That appeals to young people  You can stay on forever  Right  Because you always get new young people  That's what I say about my dates  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  You know  Underage joke  Yeah  I'm finished with dates  I'm more into prunes  At my age  I do prunes  When did you stop aging?  Jerry  Pardon? 
[02:22:30]  When did you stop aging?  Yeah, you really did  You look very good  Yeah, what's your program?  It's creepy  Got a full head of hair?  Yeah  What do you do?  Well, I kept my hair  But no  You have a program?  You guys have been drinking  Jerry Sprint workout  You think this is a good face  Thank God this show's on radio  For 67, I mean, amazing  Amazing  For 40, not good  But for  You look good  He's 35, Jim  You look very healthy  Yeah  Yeah, I've been lucky 
[02:23:00]  I've been  Yeah  What are you working on?  Anything else you're working on?  I do Baggage  Which is the dating show  On the Game Show Network  Right  And I wish that had been my idea  Because I think it's a great concept  What is it?  It's a dating show  It's on every night  Here's your plug  At 6.30 and 9.30 every night  On the Game Show Network  But it's your traditional dating show  Except the twist is  The people have to bring on their baggage  Some item  During the  You know  Let's say it's a guy 
[02:23:30]  And out come these three beautiful women  And he gets to choose one of the three  That he wants to go out with  And the three beautiful women  Are all saying  Oh, choose me  And because I'm wonderful  Blah, blah  But during the course of the show  They have to reveal  Three items of baggage  Small, medium, and large  Like this  It could be  I still have lunch with my ex  Every two weeks  What would you consider that?  Big, medium, or large?  That's probably medium  Because  If you wanted to really  Have a relationship with this person  You'd say  You know  She hasn't gotten over it  But the lunch is his cum 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  Excuse me?  Testing one, two, one  That would be  That would be more large baggage  I think  What would you consider  Valtrex?  Yeah  Medium or large baggage  I think Jerry's doing  The marriage ref  For the game show  Now we're talking  I think  Spin it off  I think there's a little  Spin off here  I'll be done this summer  He'll go on for another 20 years 
[02:24:30]  Yeah  So that's pretty cool  So the girl could be really hot  But she has  She might have some  Big problem  Small, medium, and large  But finally he chooses  The one he wants to go out with  And she's all excited  They're hugging  This is great  The audience is cheering  But then just before the show ends  She gets to see  What's in his big bag  And then she can say  Hey, thanks for choosing me  But you've got too much baggage  And she dumps it  And she can say no  Yeah  What's big baggage  What do you see in this big baggage  Well the biggest we had  Is we had this  It was a woman choosing  Among these three hot guys  And the woman was beautiful  And she finally chose this one guy 
[02:25:00]  And he was just beside him  So he was so happy  They were just  Oh, jumping all around  This is going to be great  We're sending him off someplace  But then she has to open her bag  And it turns out  That she was born a man  Oh, wow  Did she still have a penis?  I couldn't tell  Really?  I was surprised  Because I don't know  So I was surprised  Did she still have a penis?  I didn't  I hope he went out with her  Jim would have been  Yay!  I thought this was supposed to be baggage  I thought bag was metaphorical  You'd consider that a three-way 
[02:25:30]  A man, a woman, a woman  Wow, that sounds cool  Definitely  It's a fun show  Yeah  So you're doing two different shows now?  Yeah  Jesus  Where are you?  In LA?  In Chicago?  Well, no  My show I do it  Right up in Connecticut  In Sanford  You're doing Connecticut  Right  That's right  I do the Mondays and Tuesdays  And normally  Wednesdays through Saturdays  We just finish taping  170 episodes  So we're making for a bit  Isn't that great?  You got away from Chicago 
[02:26:00]  To go to Connecticut  And get away from the snow  I know  Yeah  That's great  Unbelievable  Where are they  Busting the audience from, Jerry?  They don't  All locals up there?  The locals are a little scary  People come up  There are a lot of people  From New York  But we thought that  Get a big Hartford crown  We get a lot of college kids  Really?  We always do  So there are a lot of colleges  In Quinnipiac?  Yeah  170  Yesterday we had like  45 in the audience  From Yale  Which was great  Wow, really?  Yeah  So I'm saying  Oh, this is great  It was probably a project 
[02:26:30]  Yeah  I always knew we were a smart show  Yeah  Well, they weren't  They were taking notes  They were taking notes  Yeah, oh boy  It's tough to be funny  When they're sitting there  Taking notes  Western civilization  Excuse me, Mr. Springer  Could you say that again?  Yes  Can you remember anything  From early on  In your show  That now  Wouldn't even be  The least bit shocking  But back then  Was like  Oh my god  This is crazy  Well, I  I was talking about it  The other day  The first year  We did the show  We did a show  On interracial dating  And there were 
[02:27:00]  Oh, Christ  I said things  That aren't an issue now  Yeah  And it was  There was  There were protesters outside  And now, of course  We have a president  Who's the product  Of an interracial marriage  So it shows you  That's why it could be  In the time capsule  You see what is considered  Crazy or outrageous then  And now, you know  It's an embarrassment  That's why I never  Erased pictures on my iPhone  You could go back  And go  I remember  That was two years ago  This was a controversy  Your whole life was on  Oh, it was a big problem  That day  I remember being very angry  That day  You know, I could give a shit 
[02:27:30]  Scroll, scroll, scroll  Yeah  I just have photos  Of my genitals  Oh yeah, I sent that to her  Oh yeah  I texted that to her  And she didn't want to  I can't believe  There was a time  When people thought  This girl was too young  I just hate  When you plug in  The wrong number  Oh  You do that?  Oh  Yeah  Have you ever sent  The wrong text  To the wrong person?  No, but I  You know, I'm still  Using a rotator phone  Oh, rotary iPhone  Those are hard to carry around  Yeah  Oh, I hate the guy  With the nines 
[02:28:00]  Yeah  I know  I won't talk to anyone  You're not a gadget gizmo guy  Over the years  You haven't adopted  What?  I've started  I know this is embarrassing  But I've started doing email  Ah, just started  Wow  Yeah  Because work requires it  So you're  You are two months away  From TMZ  Having your dick picture on  The website  He won't realize  His camera's on  And he's being recorded  Jerry Springer  Sends penis to a girl  I just hope they recognize  That it is one  Why is someone 
[02:28:30]  Sending a picture  Of cauliflower?  What is this?  Vegetarian?  And why is it leaking?  Oh, Jesus Christ  So you've  You also launched  A career for us  For Steve  You're a charity guy  Yeah, yeah  We produce his show  Yeah, yeah  That's doing well  Yeah  He's pretty good  I watched his show 
[02:29:00]  A few times  And he gets right  In people's faces  Yeah, he plays  The tough guy  Yeah, the tough guy  I like when he yells  At young teen girls  Yeah  It's a lot of fun  To watch a big brawny  Ex-cop yelling  At teen girls  You're a lonely man  Yes, I am  It's a lot of fun  I am  Jerry  Jerry  Jerry  You probably have  The most racially  Mixed audience  Of anybody on TV  Though  It's like you really  Across the board  It's like half black 
[02:29:30]  Half white  I don't think anybody  Has it  Maybe Oprah  But aside from that  Yeah, yeah  No, it's always  Been a diverse  I mean  NASCAR  This is true  I love the people  On the show  I mean most of them  You know, obviously  Why everyone's  I mean I really  I enjoy them  I think they're cool people  They do things  You know, they're on the show  Because they've done something  Which is a little bit weird  But otherwise  They're just  They're like everyone else  So like you hang out  With them and stuff after  They don't fit in my  I like how Jerry goes 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, they're just like  Anyone else  You know  The guy that's dating  This woman  And then having sex  With her sister  And the husband  Is married to the guy's  Brother  It's like  I always say  You take any newspaper  In American  By the time you're  On page three  I've got 20 shows  Yeah  Right  Some of us  Just dress better  But everyone's got a story  What was the topic  When the Yale students  Were there?  What was the one you did  When there was the 45 Yale students?  I don't have a clue  I can't remember  Well because we  Yeah, I mean 
[02:30:30]  It's all the same  Somebody probably  Was cheating  Or someone  I mean  String theory  We  The titles of the show  Are put on afterwards  So  Because we don't know  Figure out what's going to happen  Well yeah  Because you don't know  What's going to happen  So we do  Let's say  Three stories a show  That's fantastic  And so  Then we find  Some common denominator  Or maybe we pick  One of the stories  And there was something funny  That happened here  And that's what we titled the show  But you know  The producers don't create  The subjects  The people call them  With their stories  So that defines  What the show is about 
[02:31:00]  And then they could probably  Change kind of midway through  It could change topics  Oh because you don't know  Yeah  And they never know  Where I'm  See I'm not allowed  To know what the subjects are  Really?  So yeah  No  I mean they give me the card  But the card only has  The names of the guests  Because I don't know  Who they are  So they say  These are the names  And then I'm supposed to  Ask questions  As if I were sitting at home  To find out what the subject is  And then make jokes about it  So  But if you're  At this point in your career  If you see Tyrone and Shaniqua  You know someone's baby  Is not known  Yeah  Who the father is 
[02:31:30]  Right  You know that  Jim Bob  And Clarabelle  You know it's going to be  Some domestic violence thing  Yeah  A guy with his wife  Beater shirt on  And a Schlitz  Schlitz  When was the last time?  I know  Schlitz is an old beer  It is  I swear  That  Schlitz  Oh my gosh  I have not heard that  Do people scam a lot  To get on the show?  No  Maybe in the early days  They did  Now there's so many lawyers  Involved  And you have to sign  Releases in front of a camera 
[02:32:00]  Right  You go into a room  Where the lawyers sit  And then you  You have to swear  That everything you're saying  Is the truth  And you've got to  Protect your own ass  Probably  Have you ever been  I think very few times  Do we get scammed  It's happened  Have you been worried  About lawsuits though  With some of the stuff  Being exposed  Some of the physical contact  No  If there is  If there's a surprise  On the show  You're told that  There's going to be a surprise  And you're given a list  Of 21 possibilities  Holy shit  So you don't know  Which of the 21 
[02:32:30]  It's going to be  But you have to  Okay all 21 possibilities  It's like the firing squad  Where the one guy  Gets the clip full of blanks  Yeah  You always have the element of doubt  Yeah  So therefore  Because we're not out  And I'm serious  We're not out to hurt anyone  I mean this is a television show  We want to have fun  So if it's going to be something  That someone really  Doesn't want to hear  Then we're not going to do  But wait  Don't people ever figure it out though  Like if the 21 things  Is you know  Your trip to the moon  Your gay experience  In that rest area  In Norwalk  And then a bunch of  Other ridiculous things  They kind of know  What it's going to be  Figure it out 
[02:33:00]  I randomly chose Norwalk  Of course  I didn't stop in there once  I'm trying to think  Where I remember you from  You're always performing  In Norwalk  But you know what I mean  Do people ever figure it out  Like just the options  Like that's the one thing  They don't want out  I'm sure they do  I mean because there are people  That say no  I'd rather not be on  Oh you have them  Back out last minute  Oh sure  Well it isn't the last minute  They're giving the list  You know  Several days in advance  Oh okay  I bet you the lawyers  Have made it difficult  To do the show now too  Huh Jerry  Not really  We get thousands of calls a week 
[02:33:30]  From people who want to be on  No I mean  But the lawyers  Telling you like  Eh  I bet you it was a lot different  20 years ago when you started  You didn't have to deal with lawyers  Well they knock out  In other words  By the time it really gets  To the producers  Dealing with it  We then  They have passed  All the hurdles  They have to pass  Right  So if it's something  That's clearly  Going to be a legal problem  They don't even get  Near the show  Was there a show  You wanted to do  And the lawyers shut you down  Well I wouldn't know  Because I never  As I said  I never  See that's a great way  To fucking live  Ignorance is bliss  See because we know  And it gets frustrating 
[02:34:00]  It's like come on  We could do that  Yeah no I'm not  We could stick up a bat  We could stick a bat  Up a girl's high  Come on  What's wrong with that  We've done it  That's great  Or it's not signed by mantle  Is it a  We might have done that  Is it a 38 inch  It worked  That was a little  I like a thin handle  Have you  In all these years  Maybe you've had  A brash 20 year old  Or something  That now would be 40  And bumps into you  And says hey Jerry  I was on your show  Oh we still  We're getting the kids  Of original guests 
[02:34:30]  Really  Okay  Wow  And these people  Were told not to procreate  So  And they're just as bad  As their parents  Right  Right Jerry  Oh Jesus  Do you have any negative  Feedback from people  Like when  In person  Like when people see you  Go you know hey  This is really weird  Never  Never  Ever  Isn't that amazing  If you held a gun  To my head  And tried to make me  Remember one person  That ever  You know  Was upset with me  In person  That would be inappropriate  On my part 
[02:35:00]  Honestly  I don't ever remember  First of all  If people don't like the show  They don't watch it  True  So when you're in television  You don't run into negative  Ever  Now  Well people write articles  Yeah  But I mean in terms of  Meeting people  Never  Yeah  They either don't know the show  Or they don't like it  So they don't watch it  Or they're big fans  Are you ever tempted  Like Larry Flint did something  Which I loved  Which is  There were  The conservatives  That were going after porn  And stuff  He put out a million dollars  For anybody that could ruin  One of them  Like with 
[02:35:30]  Having an affair with them  Yeah  It was great that he did that  Yeah  And he actually did  Somebody had some  You know  Husband already  Or somebody had to resign  It was really humiliating  Did you ever want to go after people  That really targeted you  I mean how do you  Resist that temptation  To just ruin them for it  What's the difference  I mean  It's only a TV show  So I never take it seriously  Right  I mean  You could say anything  About the show  And you wouldn't upset me  Right  It's a TV show  I think that's the reason  People don't come after you  Is because  I think  I disagree with you 
[02:36:00]  It is stupid  It's unbelievable  You could tell  Watching the show  That he's just there  Like having fun  And just  Not taking it so seriously  So how do you go up to him  And go  You're scandalous  You'd just be like  Wow  I mean be like  Let's say you're a Yankee fan  And someone comes up  The Yankees suck man  They're terrible  Right  Do you not sleep at night  Because that guy said  The Yankees were terrible  No it's because  I run them down with my car  Yeah  Okay  For that  For that  I'm on your side  On that  That's why his show  Is successful  And he navigates  Any type of negative stuff 
[02:36:30]  Because that's the way  You gotta be  Who cares  What happened with  America's Got Talent  I love that show  I love that you were  A part of that  I do the live show  Ah you wanna be on TV Jerry  I know you  Nick Cannon took your spot  And I was bummed out  They wanted to go younger  Or something  Yeah  You were great  You were great on that show though  Yeah  Well  I've been watching  Since season one  Yeah I enjoyed doing it  And I enjoyed doing the live show  But that summer  It wasn't just that  It was also that  I got offered  Which I did  The musical Chicago  On Broadway 
[02:37:00]  And to play Billy Flynn  And that was a  Once in a lifetime opportunity  Sure  So it was a combination of things  But I think they were very happy  That I had something to do  Because they did  I think they wanted  Wait so you're traveling the country  Doing the live show  And the two TV shows  Yeah each season  I take the ten winners  The ten finalists  Right  And two summers ago  I did three months in Vegas  With them  At Planet Hollywood  And last year  I did a 25 city tour with them  Jesus Christ  So I still work with the show  I just don't do the 
[02:37:30]  The television show  What about  Prince Poppycock  See I watched the show  He was cool  Yeah you do  Prince Poppycock  It was all about  Prince Poppycock  We were all oddly attracted to him  We've never even admitted that  To ourselves  Much less each other  But let's get it out  Right here  I think he's the only one  I remember from last season  Now that I think about it  I watched every episode  What was that little girl  Oh the opera singer  Yeah she had  What is she doing  What's her career doing now  Well she's still in school  But she did  She had a quick school 
[02:38:00]  If you have a voice like that  What's wrong with her parents  Because she had a PSA  I think she had a Christmas album  That did pretty well  Yeah  But if you have a voice like that  What is school going to teach you  You already got your gift  And go out there  And make the money for the family  How to manage your finances  So you don't get Gary Coleman  By your parents  The risk  The gamble there  Particularly  Excuse me  There's no gamble  Because I know what you're going to say  If her voice is blown out  Then she can go back to school  Same with the athletes  That are 17  Going right into the pros  They blow out a knee 
[02:38:30]  Then you go back to school  There's 40 year olds  Going back to school  The problem is  There are a lot of people  With good voices  What makes her unique  Is that she's 10 years old  That's why she's got to capitalize now  Jerry  Yeah  Oh well she's making albums  Strike while the hymen is tight  He likes little girls  No  I like jokes  You made springer uncomfortable  Do you know how hard that is to deal with it  May I have some water please  God almighty 
[02:39:00]  That's like getting a double off Rivera  20 years  20 years  20 years of  Not being offended  I want Jerry  He walks in the air  Ugh  I want Jerry to be the next Regis  Can we start the campaign for you?  You can start the campaign  Oh yeah  But they're going to go younger  Obviously  Why?  You are younger  You are younger  Why would you replace Regis  With someone  You're 13 years younger than him sir  Let's start the campaign  You want the gig right?  I'd love it  No 
[02:39:30]  No  Any thought of retiring from your show?  No  I mean I know I'm doing another four years  Wow  Because we signed with Tribune  And they're going to carry it here  So  No I mean as long as I'm healthy  Yeah  It's fun  I mean  Yeah  You know what am I going to do  Play golf  And it doesn't seem like  Four years  It doesn't seem like a lot of work for you  I mean you've got a good staff in place I guess  Oh they're phenomenal  But no I don't  For that show  No it doesn't  It isn't work  You write your own final thoughts 
[02:40:00]  Oh yeah  That I do  Okay  But the part  You have to be alert  In other words  Because you don't know what the show is about  When the camera's on  Right  You really have to be focused  You can't be thinking what else is going on  And you probably got to hear something from the audience  And know that you want to go out there  And talk to that lunatic  Is it any work?  Otherwise is it work?  No  No  You don't have to go into the office  You just show up and shoot  Yeah  I mean you've got to do the promotional stuff  And the business side of it  Yeah  So the work is the business side of it 
[02:40:30]  But not the performing part  Not the production of it  That's not work  Do you ever have a show that looks like it's going to be good  And it just turns into a dud  Like the topics just aren't moving  Usually Monday through Friday  But you'll have that once in a while  One that's just like  Eh it's just not getting anybody sparked up  Or  Well the more I talk during a show  You know  The less  The worse the show is  You want action  If you don't see me  If you hardly hear me  Then you know it's a great show  Because it's  It's going on its own  Right 
[02:41:00]  I'm there when the show's dying  Right  And now they also have the  That's true  You could get some of the  Too hot for television  Springers  Where I guess now  No pixelation on the boobies  Things like that  The ditties  When they came out in the 90s  That  I honestly think  That kind of put us over the top  Yeah  It became such a hot item  Those too hot for TV tapes  During the  Yeah mid 90s  That's when we passed Oprah  That's when all 
[02:41:30]  I mean that's when  You guys passed Oprah  Oh yeah you did  Oh yeah for  A little over a year  Yeah they got to a point where  Because  Yeah the fighting was fantastic  I hated when they  Had a team  When they told you to  Tame that shit down  So that's a lawyer  That's a lawyer  It goes there  Well they got him on a technicality  About boxing or something like that  Or fight promotion  Well it's still  No it still is there  It's just that various  Various cities will  Edit some things out  But  If you're there  The show is the same  As it always was  It's better  It's better than it was  That's for sure 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  Because it went from a point  Where you were just watching  People beating the shit  Out of each other  Yeah right  And then they would cut  Completely away  Yeah  Which was bad  Now they don't cut it  And now they don't cut it  The best part of the old shows  Was Steve just a step behind  When the fight started  Oh yeah yeah yeah  He was taking his time  He was just  Don't jump in there too fast  He was just  He was just  Holding back the girl  It was great  But what Steve  Doesn't want you to know  Is that that wasn't on purpose  That's why we gave him 
[02:42:30]  His own show  Get out of here  Do you want another  Security guy that does  Nothing we have one  Okay  I'll help you Jerry  Kenny  Here I come  Hope I don't get yelled at  For that later  Screw him  He's fine  I don't like Kenny's  Peppering of grey  It really bothers me  Oh really  Yes  I want to dip my fist  In hair dye  And apply it liberally  Jesus Christ  Well Jerry Springer 
[02:43:00]  20 years  It's amazing  Do they just get to a point  Where they just know  That it's going to do  What it does  Ratings wise  So it just cruises  And  You know what I mean  We have a niche  I mean obviously by now  You have a niche  And you're always going to  Have that audience  Right  The advantage is  And you guys know it  With your show  You have a young audience  When you have a young audience  You can be on forever  Because they're always  New young people  If you do a show  That's aimed at 35 years 
[02:43:30]  At 35 year olds  By the time  They're 37  Their tastes haven't changed  But they're bored  With the show  Right  So the show  Has trouble lasting  But if you do a show  Aimed at 16 to 22  Each year  They're going to be  Kids suddenly old enough  To listen  Old enough to watch  So every year  You get a whole new  Class of an audience  Those are great ages  Basically Tom Papa  You're fucked  Yeah  The marriage ref  One more season  He's never going to make  20 years  He's talking to those  35 year olds  One more season 
[02:44:00]  Marriage  Oh boy  Have you seen  Have you seen Tom's show  Yes  Tom gets people  Before they get to your show  That's right  That's the last stages  Of hope  Yeah  When they're still  Trying to work it out  Oh boy  It usually doesn't work out  It doesn't  You're married  How long have you been married  37 years  37 years  And was that  Was that your first and only  Yes  Wow  Yeah  She's wonderful  She really is  How do you pull that off  Is it just kind of  Your way at work every day 
[02:44:30]  You don't pull it off  And that's how it lasts  You keep it on  You learn to like cauliflower  He was never able to take advantage  Of the loose teens  That came on the show  Yeah you would think  You know  Over the 20 years  A perk of the job  What you do  I mean  Spike bubble  You literally separate  Your real life  From show business  And if you can do that  You can have success  In both ways  That's pretty good  Yeah  Why didn't you think about that  I just 
[02:45:00]  But my  My real life  Is  Is crazier  Than  Than this  Is the thing  So that  It's backwards  Oh yeah  I'm not saying  It's a formula for everybody  It just  I found the right one  No I've separated it  And luckily she has no taste  This is the mellow part  This is like the easy going  Mellow relaxed part  And then  Regular life is  Yeah  Insanity  You just crashed your car  Two days ago  I just wrapped up my fucking Mustang  Two days ago  I was so pissed  Brutal  You shouldn't have been driving it 
[02:45:30]  In this weather  Expressway service road  30 miles an hour Tom  I wasn't even going off that  30 miles an hour  Yeah  I was going 30 miles an hour  What happened to the saddle  The thing  Yeah  Mustang  His head came off  Poor thing  You just hit the ice  Yes  No ice  No ice  30 miles an hour  He was driving  Here's what happened  He was spinning around  To pick up a male hitchhiker  In skinny jeans  The tires  Very hard tires  Yeah  Racing tires  And the road  Very cold  And the engine 
[02:46:00]  Very powerful  And I spun around  When I went into third  I hit the gas  And the rear just  Came right out  And right into the guardrail  Oh  Total  800 horsepower  Doesn't help either  I was just going to the bank  My Escalade was being used  I was taking a mile drive  To the bank  One mile  I didn't make it a quarter mile  That's what you need  Space shuttle endeavor  To get to the bank  That's good  I know  I really fucked up 
[02:46:30]  But  That's why Jerry's so successful  Because he's very even keeled  He really is  You seem like you don't have a bad tab  You're a very even keeled guy  That's probably why he looks healthy  And you know  He hasn't let all the bullshit get to him  The same people like that  Are the ones that know  Where shallow graves are  Even keeled  Seemed like a normal guy  Exactly  Talked him  Always said hello  How deep are this graves  Supposed to be  Of course it's shallow  I'm in a hurry  He's been on Craigslist  In Long Island  For the last couple of years  You know what  Gilgal Beach is

[02:51:30]  And then I wear my glasses  And then I put my hair  In a ponytail  So if like  The UPS guy comes  Or something  And then they see  My name on the  And then I look  There's a kind of  A recognition  And then like  And then just  A disappointment  After that  No you don't understand  That is a sexy ass look  And I'm not even kidding  No it really is not  No it is  And I'm not trying  To be like  Oh no  Because like  I know that I do  Like the sexy pictures  And the whole thing  So I'm not being that girl  I'm just saying  It is not attractive  You can gussy up  Pretty good  Like a lot of girls  Can like you know  Make up and hair  And look really good  But there are some girls  That can be a sloppy mess 
[02:52:00]  And still look sexy  In a sloppy mess way  But you don't want  The UPS guy  To think you're really hot  Because he's coming  To your house  He knows where you live  You don't want that  Creep leering at you  From the shrubs  He should ugly it up  Before he comes  I'm going to throw  Paint on your face  Before he comes  How can brown kill you  There's very specific  From the shrubs  Did you used to work  For UPS  No I didn't  But I guess  Jimmy knows all the tricks  There's a lot of shrub work  I actually have a hat  With bushes on it  Hey we got to talk  About the Maxim  Yeah 
[02:52:30]  Okay let's talk about it  It could be one of  The hottest covers ever  Yeah we love it  Really  That little fucking  Boy shorty  It's the cross shot  Thing that you're wearing  Yeah  And a lot of controversy  Because the subscribers  Got their address label  Put right over  Your undies  Over the controversial  Of your undies  It's a  Yeah I felt bad  They should  They should also  Purchase it  I think that's  I think that's  What they were  Gunning for  It's a really big  White address stamp  Too  It's a little unnecessary 
[02:53:00]  We're going for  Something else there  It is very  Very big  What is very big  No no  The label  It's terrible  It covers up  A whole beautiful  Little frilly thing  You're wearing  Did they airbrush  That at all  To cover it  Someone said  They airbrushed it  Because they were  So worried about  What it was showing  No  Oh like through  No no  You're not airbrushing  You're going to  Airbrush something  Dirty out of it  That's what I mean  Oh you can see the skin  It looks like you don't have  Well photoshop  I was saying thanks to my water  Not thanks for the skin  The radio people 
[02:53:30]  Don't hear  That was water came  I didn't see no photoshopping  That looked  Well I know that like  The photographer that  He did my first Maxim cover  That was last January  And I love him  And a big thing for me  Was to not do a photoshop  I don't want things  To be photoshopped  It's not like a cause  Or a stance I try to make  But it's just  Like Pagita  Yeah  But I like  I want the photo  To look like the moment  From when it was taken  And I just think  It's important for me  Just to feel like 
[02:54:00]  You know  It just  It is how it is  And embrace  All the flaws  And all that  No problems going on  No problem areas  That you want him to  Take care of  Because I saw the raw photos  And that's the same  I mean  The raw photos  Same as what went online  Or when  The background was different  Because I was on a  White background  They just changed  The background  To the blue  But other than that  I asked to not be  You know  Touched  And that's why  So does the photographer  I would ask not to be  Touched either  No I heard that  They only photoshopped  How you smelled probably 
[02:54:30]  I heard they only photoshopped  Like the bottoms  Just to make them  Cover more  That's what  Yeah I don't think so  If a girl is wearing  If a girl is wearing  A very thin fabric panty  You can see right through it  I love that  I'll tell you guys this though  I was very  Maybe  I like putting that part  Of the panty  When it came to this  Cover  I was actually surprised  Because I was  Even though  You know  When you do a magazine cover  Like they  Like you don't really  Have a say  In what happens  Or which picture they use  But they've been  So great over there  And I said 
[02:55:00]  You know  I really want to use  One that's like  More  That's not like  You know  Super sexy  Like this face I'm making  That's like  The first cover  You failed then  And then I just wanted  To be like  Oh this is approachable  But it's also sexy  And you know  And all of my girlfriends  Like saw it  And that's the first one  You're looking at the wrong one  I'm looking for  Yeah maximum cover  I like how Jimmy just moaned  Oh  No no  Someone just brought him  I apologize  Someone just brought him  Water you didn't see  That was an involuntary noise  He's sitting right there  And he's sitting right there  And Jimmy goes  Ah  The real rookie mistake 
[02:55:30]  Oh it smells like  Chicken noodle soup  It's interesting how that happened  It smells like chlorine  In a minute  There we go  Look this is not  But I  But all my  I  This is so not photoshopped  It's not  No man  But see that  That's the interesting  It gets a little darker  Down there  Just a little  Yeah  It's like  That's the  Like the pelvic area  Right  Yeah I just thought  That they  They  There was something more showing  That they were panicking about  So no  Yeah you look like  Tough girl here  Yeah  I like that  Well I wanted to be like  That's 
[02:56:00]  Like you know  My girlfriends and I  We you know  When we're like  If I'm on vacation  With my girlfriends  Or hanging out  We do  We like throw on  Like little boy shorts  And a t-shirt  And we  Yes you do  That is how  I mean  I mean not like  We're not like  Doing pillow fight  Something but we're  Just very comfortable  And  Where exactly  Do you all hang out  What a great place  That must be  Near  Jimmy wants to scout out  A shrub  Paradise  The shrub boy wants to know  The shrub boy wants  But this like  You know in every  Like in every pair of  Like these are  Laced boy shorts  Yes they are  And then there's a  You know like  In every pair of panties  There's like the  Cloth part underneath 
[02:56:30]  Right  Oh  You ripped that right out  Right  No  But that's right there  You can see it  Collects all the goodness  You can see it  So I don't know  What they're saying  When it's shopped out  I call that part  The tea bag  Jesus  What were they saying  Was photoshopped out  No  No no  Only like  My penis  No  Please  You couldn't be that perfect  No no no  Just  Just  Just  I'm judging you  No just  Just saying that  There might have been 
[02:57:00]  A little bit more  Of the body  Underneath visible  Like you would see  No but I don't think so  Because my vagina  My vagina is in the  Appropriate place  Oh  My vagina  I'm not like  Thank god for that  It's not like  Like to have  To have sex with me  You wouldn't have to  Like just put your penis  Like directly  Like it doesn't  I don't believe you  Your penis has to go upwards  You know  Like a normal penis  If it went straight out  If it was perpendicular  To your body  Yeah yeah  It would hit stomach  Yeah  Jim's having a stroke  Yeah  But there were some people  Who had a little bit  Of controversy  But I believe that those 
[02:57:30]  Whoever that was  I just think that they have  Yet to see a vagina  So they're not quite sure  What it is  They're like  I see something  I think that's what it is  That's where it is  But it's great for you  That there's all this controversy  Right right right  We're all talking about this  It's great for  Well I also  It's great for Maxim  I mean I don't really  Get a percentage on this  But they sell a lot of magazines  They'll be like  Oh we like you  I'm doing a movie right now  And I'm on the Daily Show  And I've got my new NBC show  Coming out  So I had a lot of other stuff  Happening so I didn't really need  Somebody to like  To me  Yeah I like to keep 
[02:58:00]  Things focused  I do this because it's  One  I remember in college  Every boyfriend loved Maxim  And it's exciting for me  To be part of it  And I think that  They're always so great there  And I think girls can be  Sexy and funny and beautiful  And do these things  And I liked it  So I just don't  It's just more like  Shut up  When people talk like that  What movie are you doing  It's called  I don't know how she does it  It's for the Weinstein Company  It's with Sarah Jessica Parker  Oh okay  And then Greg Kinnear  Pierce Brosnan  Christina Hendricks  From Mad Men  Who are you playing  I play Sarah Jessica Parker's 
[02:58:30]  Friend and colleague  And the whole movie's about us  We work for Mutual Fun  And it's about her juggling  Like her life  And how does she do it  And how does she make it all  And I'm completely opposite from her  Like right out of Dartmouth  Whip smart  Just no kids  Not doing that whole thing  And then we just kind of  Two girls  Yes  On the same grass  You know what it is  Sarah Jessica Parker  It's a lot of laughs  But mostly a lot of heart  Oh  Right  Is it a rom-com  Rom-com  Rom-com alert  It's not a rom-com 
[02:59:00]  No  It's just a com  It's just a com  None of the rom  Com with no rom  None of the pesky rom  There's nothing really romantic  There's no romantic thing in there  Yeah  What about you  Girlfriend  Boyfriend  What do you got  Justin Timberlake  Single  Single  Justin Timberlake  What  Gossip  We got some gossip  Just friends right  I don't talk about my personal life  Yeah I wouldn't either  And I think that you guys  Are reading too many magazines  In the nail salon  Yeah see  But yeah I'm single  It's fun

[03:00:00]  Oh much too much for what I do  Hold on  How do you feel about Aussie photos  I have a feeling my apartment  Is going to be ruled out very quickly  Yeah yeah  Well you know  I think subliminally  You feel the same way  That I feel about Aussie photos  In your apartment  I love them  I think that you really  I think that  Maybe there's something  You're trying to hide  The guy that doesn't like girls  Has to leave  No I had to bring  I do like girls  Bye  Bye guy that doesn't like  Looking in pretty  Where are you going  Him and the big bopper  Getting on a plane together  I'm going to Raleigh in a snowstorm

[03:02:00]  I have a pool in a movie theater  Noted  Noted  Oh shit  You kind of have the feeling  Like the plane won't crash  But if you look around  In one of those Embraer things  And you look at just like people  God doesn't want you here  You're going down  I'm so going down  Yeah  I  Yeah  The small planes always go down  And they freak me out  Yeah  It's just not  Like they don't de-ice them enough  That's a big problem  And then they go down  Yeah  Yeah  Hey  Olivia said de-ice the plane more  Yeah  She knows she's looking out the window  Yeah  Or just don't take me down with you 
[03:02:30]  Yeah  Well that's  The whole plane  Tends to go down at once  That's that last crash  Is because they didn't  They de-iced  But when they were flying  On autopilot or something  The wings had gotten heavy  Tell her about more of it  I'm sure she's fascinated  Why not  That's what I do with beautiful women  I talk about plane crashes  And disasters  That's why I'm a lonely man  You're going to see me  In a singles bar  So you're familiar  With Jonestown  Are you  Oh  Okay  Oh  Wow  You have a sad life  I really do  No I  I'm alone a lot  I think I'm  I'm more lonely 
[03:03:00]  Than I think  Than people might think  Oh that's terrible  But it's like  Because I don't  I don't like other people  Oh that is fucking perfect  I am a friggin' hermit  I hate people  I really  I don't like meeting new people  I don't like  I have a social anxiety disorder  Everyone's like  I have a  It sounds  I don't mean it as a joke  It's the only way  I know how to describe it  But I have an allergic reaction  To douche  Like when people are douchebags  I just  I freak the fuck out  I just  I can't  You can say fuck on  Oh yeah  I just  I literally  I just freak out  And I can't take it  And I will go off 
[03:03:30]  From my friends  I mean  I went off  July 3rd  Is my birthday  Somebody threw a party  For me in the Hamptons  Again I'm new  No one told me  That Hamptons  Is like  Literally like  Adjacent to hell  And I  It was  I went off  On my  I was just  I can't do it  I can't  I just freak  I freak out  As if  Like someone's  Put me into a small box  Really  I just  I can't  I just don't like  Meeting new people  I don't like  Meeting people  I don't like  I don't like  Meeting like  You know  Older guys  Who own hotels  Who think they're like  Sexy  And then like  Want to hit on  Like somebody younger  And I'm like  Well it's cool 
[03:04:00]  Well that's a good thing  Actually  Because what I found  Is that there are  A lot of douchebags  They own hotels  Well that's why  They're hanging out  In the Hamptons  Like with like  You know  And I'm looking  At other girls  I'm like  You're 16  Oh shit  Yeah  That's weird  Here's the thing  If they have on  Like white pants  And no socks  They're douchebags  Anybody that doesn't  Wear socks with shoes  Is a douchebag  What about  When it's really hot though  What about  Still douchebags  Put on a pair of socks  Do it man  You know what  Let's not make it complicated  Keep it clean  One simple rule 
[03:04:30]  So you get a lot of  Creepy older guys  Hitting on you  And they think  Because they have money  Not realizing  You have money too  That they're gonna  Well no  But that was like  In the Hamptons  But like  I think  But that was more like  Seeing like  Older guys  Hitting on the younger girls  I mean  I have that thing  Where  I think I have a pretty  Good thing  Where I just  I can make people  Want to stay away  I have that  Where I just look at someone  And I  I can like  Furiously text to no one  And you know  Just make drafts of texts  People would get the hint  Yeah  Yeah  I'm just not like  I'm like  Oh hi  And go back down 
[03:05:00]  So no  I just watched  Older guys  Hitting on younger girls  What kind of guys  It's gotta be  I mean  If you're dating  Non-celebrities  It's gotta be  Threatening to them  Your career  And the fact  That everybody  Comes up to you  I mean  I always wonder  What it would be like  To date somebody  Who other people  Want photos with  It's just gotta be  Kind of uncomfortable  I think  I don't  I think that the only  I don't  I mean  I honestly  Don't date that much  The only  And when I've  Gone out with people  Who aren't in the business  It's  There's  It's only been with  And I can only  I can only remember 
[03:05:30]  One off the top of my head  Because  When I'm  Especially now  When I meet people  I can always tell  Like with a guy  If I meet a guy  And like he comes up  And I'm like  Oh he's cute  He's nice  And then  And then he  Says something  And then he's like  Oh it's  You know  Then he says my last name  I'm like oh Libby Mun  And it's just that weird thing  Where it's just like  You know  It's a weird  You just  I don't know  And then I'm like  Oh if we end up fucking  It might be weird  Because like  You might be saying  My last name too  Not for him  But you worry  That he's just kind of  He's seeing you  And your name  And going wow  It would be great  To fuck out  Because of her name 
[03:06:00]  Well because here's the thing  Is like you know  Eventually  I'm doing everything  I can to  You know  To you know  I go to  You know  A good facialist  And take care of my body  And all that stuff  But eventually  Age will happen  And you want to be  With somebody who  Seize past that  Because fame is  It's so you know  Fleeting  And success  You know  It might  Hopefully I could  Stay successful  And keep growing  And growing  But like  Sometimes you're hot  Sometimes you're not  And you want someone  Who wants you  When you're not  Like the one  And if I  If someone just likes me  Because like  They can go home 
[03:06:30]  To their friends  Or their family  And be like  Oh hey  Then they're not  Going to want me  When I'm like on  You know  A Gilmore Girls  Remake or something  Which one  God hopefully  I wouldn't want me either  You'll see them  Start texting  And being like  Oh you don't  You don't get to see  This text  Yeah  Who is that  Oh forget about it  Oh  Someone  Someone  Has that happened  To you  No I've seen it happen  It's awful  I would never  If a guy was  It was like  Super secretive  About his text  I wouldn't want to  I would 
[03:07:00]  I wouldn't be with that guy  I'm that girl who  If I think a guy  I think  I've been with a guy  Who cheated  Like when I was like 18  And just never  And then again later  And I was like  In my like  You know  Early 20s  How did you know  They cheated  They told you  Or you actually  Caught them  You can just  Yeah  Well at first  You feel it  You're like  Hmm  Like this seems weird  And then you end up  Catching them  And usually guys are  I mean  The guys that cheat  I think are stupid  Enough to get caught  Sometimes usually  People want to get caught  That's what I think  Did you do any snooping  Are you like a snooper  Did you go through  Like the phone  Or like 
[03:07:30]  So they were dumb enough  To leave their Facebook open  I don't do that any  Well  This was like  I haven't  I mean I haven't done it  Since I was like  Maybe 22  But my 18 year old boyfriend  I learned how to crack  His code  For his voicemail  Because I remember  His favorite number  Was 12  So then  One day I remember  Calling him  And then I pushed  My head went to the  Receiver  And it pushed  The star button  And he goes  Please enter your password  And I was like  Oh shit  And I was like  What  I was like  Hmm  So I tried  His favorite number  Like immediately  And I was like  You have three new voicemails  And I was like  Holy fucking shit 
[03:08:00]  And there was all these girls  And after that  I accidentally saved a message  By accident  And he was like  Are you checking my  Because I have a save  I'm like  No why would I  How would I even know  How to do that  And then he changed it  And I remember  Trying to check it  And he's like  Ah  So then I was like  Oh  Let me try  I'll just  And I tried a few  Different numbers  And then finally  When I was like  I bet he's so stupid  I bet he thinks  He thinks he's so clever  That this would be like  No one would try this  But he's just so stupid  That it's so easy  So I tried 1, 2, 3, 4  And it worked  Oh my god  Yeah 
[03:08:30]  I was like  Because he probably thinks  Oh I'm so clever  No one will think  Of this easy one  I was like  You jackass  And then  Then he changed it again  Because then I started like  Are you  I'm like  Are you  Are you dating somebody else  I know  Because I met  I met this person  Who's friends with this person  They told me  Because I would know  The girl's name  Hey it's you know  Bitch of the month  It's blah blah blah  So then  And then he changed it again  Because I still stayed with the guy  You know  Because I was an idiot  And then  And then  One time he called on my phone  And then I saw  And I saw the code again 
[03:09:00]  Because it saved in my phone somehow  I don't know  I was very lucky  So I would totally  I think if you can find out  You should find out  But there's a difference  Between wanting to know the truth  And then wanting to just know  What you want to hear  Because you stayed with him  After you kind of knew  Oh yeah  Like people always know  How long did you stay with him  After you kind of knew  Like a year  Oh wow  It was like  It was 18 to like  19  Yeah  19 and a half  Something like that  And then another guy dated  When I was  21  And he cheated on me  All the time  But at one point 
[03:09:30]  I was  But I wasn't really  Attracted to him  Because I just moved out  Well actually  I was like  No I was 24  Because I just moved out  To California  So  23  24  And he cheated on me a lot  But he was like  The only guy I knew  And he was really nice  And thought of him more  As a friend  So when I knew  He was cheating on me  I kind of felt like  Oh great  She can fuck you  And I don't have to  But like  I started to like  Hang out  Have a friend  And like  We go to dinner  And like  Oh shit  You get screeners  And I'll watch them  At your house  How do you cheat  On Olivia Mont 
[03:10:00]  Sometimes people  Have bad chemistry though  That's what I just  Keep thinking here  Did you have bad  Sexual chemistry  Or bad  Maybe you're better  As friends  Some people  Are just better  As friends  Some people  Are better as friends  Which is why  When I meet some guys  And it's not a personal thing  It's just like  There's something wrong  With you  It's just not there  And I would rather  Especially nowadays  I won't date  I just won't date  Unless I just  I really really really like you  And I just think  That there is something there  And there's people  I'm like  Oh  Maybe I could just  Have sex for a little bit  But then after a while  It's like I have to talk to you  Have sex for a little bit  So I just can't do 
[03:10:30]  But I think  I think  In my opinion  From the guy  It's like that  They  It's just not  I'm just not the one  And they also  Want  They just need  Their egos filled  You know  Nothing's ever enough  Did you ask the 24 year old  If he was cheating on you  And he just fessed up  He was  34  When I was with him  Oh I meant  When you were 24  Okay  Yeah  But yes  I did ask him  And he  That's what I find  With guys  You have to  You have to ask  The guys I met  Weren't liars 
[03:11:00]  Which I was lucky  But you just had to ask them  The right question  Like a guy  Code word  One of the last guys  I dated  I said  When I met him  I said  Do you have a girlfriend  And he said  No  Okay  Does she think  You're her boyfriend  I think it's very interesting  Because I wasn't sure  If they were broken up or not  But I think  Because guys were like  Because guys later  Because I had to think  Down to the  You know  Down the path  Well yeah  But I didn't think  That we were together  But she  I don't know  But yeah  And I'm like so  And he said no 
[03:11:30]  So that's a very specific question  So it was like lawyer talk  Like sometimes people  Give you the lawyer answer  Like technically in court  They're not lying  No I don't have her  As a girlfriend  She believes  That I am her boyfriend  Yeah  But I think  But guys  I feel like  You just ask them  The right question  It's frustrating  But you just have to do it  To figure out  The right question  So you find like  But is it harder  To trust people  The more famous you get  And the more successful  Because you said  Now they know your last name  Is it harder to trust  Somebody's motives  When they're  Well I don't really think 
[03:12:00]  I'm  Like right now  There's a lot going on  And people might  See my face  I don't think that people  More people know my name  Than they did like  You know last month  But more people know my face  But I don't  I'm not like  I'm not like racing around  There's not like paparazzi everywhere  People aren't like  More people I can see  That they turn and look  But no one's like  Freaking out  Or anything like that  So I don't think  A lot of people  Really quite know  Or they  But ever since I was young  People thought I had  One of those faces  Where they go  Don't I know you  So I think people just get  They just don't know who I am  Or they think they know me  But I don't know 
[03:12:30]  I don't really talk to anybody  Like I go out  I don't want to talk to anybody  Don't talk to anybody  Yeah I've been from the school  Of I have my friends  Fuck everybody else  I've had them for years  And I just  Your friends fuck everybody else  No no  I'm like I have all my friends  Oh you have your  Fuck everyone else  I have my friends  Semicolon  Yeah right  Fuck everyone else  Fuck everyone else  Got it  Because yeah  You reach a point where it's like  I don't want to know anybody new  Screw this  But I always hate when people say  I just don't need any more friends  I think it's a really douchey  Like egotistical thing  I could always use 
[03:13:00]  Like great new people in my life  I just  I just  I'm  I'm just weird  I'm really  I'm hard  I think I'm hard to hang out with  Because I  I have like  I get anxiety  I'm like oh I don't want to go in there  Like we can go in somewhere  And it's fine  And I'm like no let's go  Because everyone's wearing jerseys  It's weird  Let's go  I don't like it  And I get anxiety  And I just can't do it  Do you have brothers and sisters?  Mm-hmm  I'm the second to the youngest  The youngest girl  And there's a little brother underneath me  Out of how many?  Five  Oh okay 
[03:13:30]  Big family  Damn  Oh that's gotta suck  And you grew up in Tokyo?  Can't you just pop a Xanax and go for it?  No I don't do Xanax  No?  Anything?  I have an inhaler  Because I get  I mean I get full on panic attacks  I have had two that put me in the hospital  Holy shit  Because I didn't know  The first time I decided  It's my asthma  It's my asthma  But I had a doctor to tell me  When you have a panic attack  Your heart rate's going so high  Like you could  Like the last time she said  It was almost  She's like  You might have like a heart attack anytime  Fuck  Like I was like  Because I get  Because I really get so much 
[03:14:00]  I think that's why  When I  Like when people read interviews with me  Or when I say things  Or when I talk  I'm very  I'm honest  Because like  I just  I can't like  I don't think I could ever live in a lie  I'm like  Oh  And I just kind of like  Fumble my way through things  Which I think most people have like  You know  Stage dancers  Or they just say no comment  And I'm just like  I don't really want to talk to you anymore  Do you drink at all?  Yeah  Yeah  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Yeah  What's your poison?  I used to never drink  Ever 
[03:14:30]  Not just because I didn't like the taste of it  But I drink wine  Wine, yeah  Like I went through a period where  Because on my show  Perfect Couples  It's on NBC  It airs Thursday nights at 8.30  Yeah  Nice  Good plug  You should watch it  You know why?  Because you're in it  Because you're in a rainbow  Oh  Yeah you want  I don't know how to do that  But  There's six cast members  All five are in serious relationships  I'm the only single one  And everyone leaves right afterwards  And they run home to their loved ones 
[03:15:00]  And I hang out  And I'm talking with everyone  Ask where they're from  Until I realize that  When the producers and directors  Are just staring at me  Like  You're still here  And I'm like  Oh this is awkward  And then I have to call it out  Because that's my anxiety coming out  So I go  Oh this is awkward  Because you want me to leave  Because you think it's weird  Because now I'm making you feel sad  Because you realize  Holy shit  How sad my life is  Now I'm not going to make you  Okay I'm going to go  And then I go home  And I started doing this thing  Where I'd open a bottle of red wine  And a bowl of peanut M&M's  And that was my life  How great is this? 
[03:15:30]  Olivia Munn is like  William Holden at home  Who would have guessed?  It's fantastic  But I'm not one of those girls  Also it's like  Oh  You know those girls  Like I was skinny  And awkward growing up  And that's why  I'm not  I have a very great life  And I'm very happy  And very fortunate  And there are people  Who are very nice to me  I just am not nice  You know to myself probably  And I just like hole away  You know what I find  I have trouble taking  A deep deep breath sometimes  I don't know if that's anxiety  Yeah that's anxiety  For me  And like I have to actually  Prop myself up sometimes in bed  And then I can do it  I don't know what it is 
[03:16:00]  But it's been happening  For a long time  I mean it's gout  I hope so  The gout  Either that or it's my heart  No but do you feel like  Anxiety?  I don't know  I go like this  When it happens  And then I can  Literally it pops  Because like the tension  What do you do?  No I'm actually asking you  Because I go like this  She puts her arms back  I'm pushing out my boobs  Is what I'm doing  But my  But it pops like my  Like right in here  And like the doctor  It's like it's all that tension  And all the muscles around it  Literally it's  Everything  I  It's my anxiety  Is  Can get  I'm doing really good though  I've been 
[03:16:30]  I've only had  Two moments  Yeah  And one  The first moment  Was in November of 2009  And it was  A month or so  After like  I first got into tabloids  Because of a relationship  That I was in  And we were together  For you know  Three or four months  Prior to that  Before it came out  And then all of a sudden  It comes out  So it's very shocking  And then there's paparazzi  And it was just a weird world  Where people were saying  Nice things  But it's just weird  To like  You know  When you're still deciding  Like if you like someone  Or not  Then the world is telling you 
[03:17:00]  If they think you're a good couple  Or not  And I full on had a  Like I passed out  At my home  I was like  Just I passed out  After three days  Of like not breathing well  And then end up in the hospital  And then  And then  And then I was able to focus it  And then it didn't happen again  Until like  This  When I was shooting my show again  Did you feel it just creep up on you?  I can  Now I know what it is  Because like  I can't take a full breath  He described it the best  Because for me  Anthony described it  Like it's like  You can't get the click  Like where you're like  You know that final click 
[03:17:30]  It's like topping out  You know that  Yeah it is  It's like  It's a full  Like it looks like  I think  I see it like a  Just like a wheel  It's like you go here  And then you just can't  Come  And then  And it feels like  You can't get that  And then I know what it is  And then I have to take an inhaler  And then I  There's  I do have like  Ativan  As an emergency  But then I never  What's Ativan do?  Ativan is  For me  I can't take Xanax  I mean those are so harsh  And they make me go to sleep  And I said I can't take an anxiety pill  Because I can't lose my personality  Because that's  You know  I'd rather have a heart attack  Than like not work  Which probably would give me a heart attack 
[03:18:00]  If I didn't work  But it's so much more mild  I only take like half a milligram  If I need it  And it's only so that  I don't have a heart attack  And it calms me down  Does it happen more  When you're sitting up  Or when you're lying down  Or when you're  For me I find it  When I'm  If I'm laying on my back  And I can't get that like breath  I just start to panic  And then I have to prop myself up  Well  I don't know  Worst line ever to a woman  By the way  No I think it's  I think  I think what you're talking about  Is different than  Like an anxiety  Because in the 80s  I would get them like  Fucking  Panic attacks 
[03:18:30]  Yeah  And out of nowhere  You'd just be like  And then all of a sudden  It's like  In the back of your head  And then the worry  That it's coming  Makes it worse  Well now that you know  Well for me  Now when I know what it is  I don't worry  Right exactly  I can control it  But my doctor explained to me  A panic attack is not  When something is bad  It can be good  It's just overstimulation  So your body  It's just like  You're going through  Like you're just  So for me  A lot of times  Things are really really exciting  Things are really great  I just  It was so much  And too much  You become super sensitive 
[03:19:00]  To every  Like smells  And sight  And like  Peripheral shit  You just become like  An animal  You're all like  Shaky  And it's terrible  Yeah it is  Just not fun  No no  I occasionally get  Like a feeling  Like I used to  When I did get them  And I'd be like  Shut the fuck up  Get out of here  Well is it  Because your life is good  You're happy  Like you love your job  You have a movie theater  In your house  In a pool  In a pool  Got it  You had a sports car  Until two days ago  I crapped  What'd you have 
[03:19:30]  A Mustang Shelby  GT  Not a GT  Super Snake  You had a Shelby  It was like 800 horsepower  And I decided to take it  To the bank  Because  Did you get hurt  Yeah I was like  A little fucking dizzy  For the past couple of days  Did you hurt somebody else  Nah I hit a guardrail  Fucking  That's stupid  I know  The wheels  If it's somebody else  At least you're like  Oh that sucks  But you can kind of  Lay on them  Like well they weren't  They're kind of weird  There was no blaming it  On anyone but me  He had the window down  He was actually yelling  Vroom vroom  As he's rolling  Shut up  I was  It was too cold 
[03:20:00]  So the wheels were spinning  And I spun out  We gotta get her out of here  She's got a very busy day  I'm going through  The gauntlet of serious  Olivia Munn  Perfect Couples  Thursday nights at 8.30  On NBC  Please yes  We'll take a look at that  And also the Daily Show  Daily Show  Yeah it might be on  Today or tomorrow  Not quite sure  And the Maxim's on  Newsstand  It's doing real well  We don't have to  Promote that obviously  Yeah it's fantastic  Very good  And Olivia Munn  On Twitter  Oh yeah  Sorry about the indecency  I apologize  This is terrible  I'm sorry  Come back and see us  Yeah thanks guys  You guys were awesome  Thank you  Alright Olivia Munn
