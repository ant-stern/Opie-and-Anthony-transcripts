<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, focusing on the Winter Olympics, particularly curling, and the perceived lack of respect shown to retiring radio personality Scott Shannon by his former co-host, Todd Pettengale.  A debate ensued on whether Scott and Todd, or Mike and the Mad Dog, displayed greater animosity towards each other.  Other pre-show topics included Bill Burr's tweet referencing Anthony Cumia's old arrest video,  a discussion of Lady Di and Marion’s physical appearances (including a humorous comparison of their hypothetical nude bodies), Bruce Jenner's transition, and the reality show "90 Day Fiancé."  Callers contributed their opinions on the Olympics,  its retired sports, and dramatic moments from the games, including a snowboarder's helmet-cracking fall.  A video of a commentator skiing down a men's downhill course was also shown.

The main show started with a discussion of curling, followed by a Beatles cover of "Hey Bulldog," and several commercial breaks (LLC.com, Sylvan Learning, Pajamagram, Steven Singer Jewelers, AmeroFactors, ProFlowers, Sherry's Berries). A "Dr. Steve Medical Minute" segment tackled the risks of anal sex.  Further commercials for Australian Dream arthritis cream and "American War Stories" aired.  The hosts then discussed the birthdays of Ginger from Gilligan's Island and Sarah Palin, before launching into a critical discussion of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's policies, particularly his proposed tax increases, with a caller, Petey from Texas, expressing concerns about the potential exodus of wealthy residents.

The conversation shifted to a kindergarten Valentine's Day card policy requiring impersonal cards for each classmate, sparking a debate on overprotective parenting, bullying, and the changing nature of childhood.  This segment included frequent highly offensive and vulgar language.  Callers shared personal anecdotes about bullying, and offered differing viewpoints on the topic. The discussion broadened to include Mark Zuckerberg's success, violence as a deterrent to bullying, martial arts, Common Core, teachers' challenges, school lawsuits, and online bullying.  A humorous moment arose from a news report mistakenly identifying Samuel L. Jackson as Lawrence Fishburne. Shirley Temple's death was also briefly mentioned.  Numerous commercials aired throughout.

The next segment revisited the Samuel L. Jackson news story, playing a clip of the reporter's profuse apology.  The hosts then showed a video of a politely handled drunk driving arrest in Australia, contrasting it with American policing styles.  Listener calls followed, covering a John Mayer performance, a listener's experience with a groping cab driver, Whitney Houston's death anniversary, Buster Douglas's upset victory over Mike Tyson, dental issues related to porcelain laminates, Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon’s public appearances, a previous on-air apology, Coco (Ice-T's wife) showing her breasts, and Nathan Fielder's "Dumb Starbucks" stunt.  The segment concluded with a discussion about a TLC show featuring a morbidly obese woman, Penny, and her enabling husband. Comedian Colin Quinn called in with a Valentine's Day anecdote.

A subsequent segment focused heavily on Penny, her lap-band surgery, and her continued overeating, with the hosts and caller "Cigars and Scotch" using highly offensive language to criticize her and her husband.  Clips from the show documenting her weight-loss journey were shown. Kirk Fox, host of "The Test," joined the show, discussing his experiences and comparing his approach to his participants with that of Opie and Anthony. The segment concluded with advertisements and plugs.

The final segment started with a discussion of the hosts' use of NutriBullets, including a shocking admission of adding semen to the blend.  The conversation then focused on *My 600-lb Life* and a featured woman's struggles with obesity.  A commercial break featured Steven Singer Jewelers, followed by a studio visit from DJ Who Kid and Nicole. Who Kid shared an anecdote about avoiding arrest due to a police union card.  More humorous exchanges, mentions of Lady Di and Bob Lee, and commercials for Pajamagram (featuring pajamas with "hidden secrets") and Bare Minerals makeup were included.  DJ Who Kid promoted his new mixtape before the show ended.  This segment also contained frequent use of vulgar and offensive language, including racial slurs and sexually explicit references.

[00:01:00]  in 30 minutes broadcasting's finest duel will hit the airwaves  and prepare for the incomparable opie and anthony show  only a show this big could have a pre-show this good  welcome to the opie and anthony pre-show with sam roberts  welcome indeed hello and good morning it's tuesday here on the ona pre-show 
[00:01:30]  my name is sam roberts and we will be here for the next 30 minutes or so counting down  until the tuesday edition of the live opie and anthony show begins call up 866-WOW-1-WOW-866-969-1969  and talk about what happened yesterday on the show what you expect to happen today on the show  what we're excited about what we want to hear the guys take on of course the olympics are still 
[00:02:00]  happening they're just on 24 hours a day it's so weird that this i guess i mean it's worldwide  so it doesn't exist in a time zone it's on one of the tvs here we're watching live  and the exciting thing about the olympics is that it brings back an event that i think  the opie and anthony show really uh popularized i think that i mean and it's an event it is the most  it has to be the most ridiculous olympic event there is and that of course is curling 
[00:02:30]  i hadn't heard anything about curling as a sport before the opie and anthony show got on board with  it but uh that was what four years ago or eight years ago uh eight years it was eight years ago two  winter olympics ago when ona first became obsessed with curling and it's become a tradition now  every time the olympics comes back uh here it is the return of curling it was brief but noteworthy 
[00:03:00]  on yesterday's show curling is terrific you don't know where to find it you like search the channel  you're like what the fuck is anything but i think there's only 20 people in the world that know how  to sweep properly so yeah so if you and i or anyone else out there were if we were curling we wouldn't  need the sweeping part no because that wouldn't make any difference whatsoever it would just be  shuffleboard uh shuffleboard on ice why you think that that sweeping thing uh they sweep to move it 
[00:03:30]  what a few inches a couple feet whatever you you can't do that there's no way you would be able to  do that moving it or slowing it uh depending depending on what they need to do they either push like ice  shavings in front of the the stone yes or they make it nice and smooth so it goes a little faster  they could curve it they can make it turn a little bit we can't do that no i hear there's like clubs on  on long island staten island but if you went there if they gave you one of those brooms it'd be a waste 
[00:04:00]  of time you wouldn't actually be doing anything significant you'd be lucky if you could even get the  thing straight down the ice like what are they doing training to be wives are they turning  it is so strange that not only that it's like a real sport but it's an olympic sport which means  there are people that dedicate their lives to curling and i would imagine that this is it the  winter olympics come it's like finally it's here but what do you do after that i mean running i 
[00:04:30]  understand or skiing seems like you could ski all year round you could find spots and worst case  scenario you can become a ski instructor there's no curling instructors what are you going to raise  the next generation of curlers but i'm glad that that sport is back and the whole winter olympics is  back it's always fun to hear ona's take i i think even more so than the summer olympics on the winter  olympics uh let's go to bart in pennsylvania bart welcome to the open anthony pre-show if you want to 
[00:05:00]  call in 866-WOW-1-WOW 866-969-1969 what's up bart hey sam i was wondering are the boys going to treat  that geriatric ginger fuck bill burr the same as all the other fans with his tweet uh to anthony  yesterday asking uh showing him a video of that uh that british guy that was getting arrested but was  doing it classy as fuck like resisting and shit oh i said did bill burr to it did bill burr tweet in 
[00:05:30]  that video yesterday yeah and it's an old video right yeah that the show already went over you  wonder the boys always go after the fans are they going to go after bill burr the same well i think  that the difference is and i get what you're saying you know what's good for the goose is good for the  gander yes i remember that i'm looking at the tweet now bill burr tweeted anthony uh the most  polite guy of all time getting arrested but yeah we played that on the show i mean months ago at 
[00:06:00]  this point bill doesn't know and here's the difference anthony especially opie somewhat but  anthony especially does go after fans big time when it comes to getting tweets of videos that he's already  seen the difference is i think bill burr has built up enough credibility with the show in terms of what  he's given us content wise in terms of coming on the show and always delivering that he can afford  to slip up here and there most of the time when listeners are tweeting anthony the same video over 
[00:06:30]  and over again it's not guys who have consistently consistently delivered on this radio program the  way bill burr has not many people have let's go to lou in new jersey what's up lou what's going on  how you doing i just wanted to compliment you guys and with the scott shannon sent uh send off  uh it was actually better than the one that uh plj actually even sent for that yeah i think i think  you're right lou i think we did tribute scott shannon on this show yesterday better than his own station 
[00:07:00]  wpoj did but i personally believe that that's because our own e-rock cares more about scott shannon  than anybody at that radio station he was working for cared about him i mean e-rock was distraught over  this thing all day even on friday when our big super show was happening we were all over the place  worrying about lady die and marion and worrying about bobo and mike bachetti and stalker paddy  and eric was sitting there going i'm hearing some new rumors about scott shannon i mean this was his 
[00:07:30]  world this was his whole world he's a radio he was raised on the radio we we got into of  course scott shannon from scott and todd who we've talked about so many times here on the opian  anthony show is retiring from radio he surprised everybody on friday and announced it we didn't  have time to talk about it much on friday when it was first happening because we had so much going on  with the super show and all that but we got into it yesterday and i personally and i think i think e-rock 
[00:08:00]  especially liked jim's take on it because e-rock to me he was on the air with ona and he felt even  though we've made fun of scott shannon for years i don't think e-rock's ever had a problem with that  he felt a little protective over scott and didn't feel like todd who's obviously ready to just take  over that show uh was respectful at all i mean they've already they've already announced that they're 
[00:08:30]  relaunching the scott and todd show as just the todd show even though he's got a room full of people  with him now it's just the todd show um and in in that clip that we were listening to yesterday  you could tell that todd couldn't be less upset about scott shannon leaving uh and jim broke out his  todd pettengale impression to illustrate exactly what was going on in the mindset of todd yesterday  the todd show coming uh uh february 24th that's it huh and they have like it's counting down it's a 
[00:09:00]  new opportunity to try to get something going what could he possibly do on his song parodies  oh that's it hey look this is scummy mcdisloyal  hey this is this is judas mcbrutus  hey this is stabber back cocksucker parody writer 
[00:09:30]  oh chubba chubba yeah remember that he paved the way and then i got hopped up on the ride  wrote a bunch of song parodies yes you see my work what was your name i didn't catch it uh the first  time around um i'm vulture mc grave jumper  vulture mc grave jumper yeah yeah yeah we squeezed him out like a tube of toothpaste and now it's finally 
[00:10:00]  my turn to shine  you do wonder exactly what todd's plan is with this whole thing does he really think that  scott was holding him back and now he's going to be able to set the world on fire by playing the same  prank phone calls that he did 10 years ago and the worst parody songs anywhere on the radio is that i don't  know i mean we had fun at scott's expense just because you know he looked like stonehenge and 
[00:10:30]  couldn't talk anymore but the real awfulness of that show has always been todd i mean that's that's the  real cringe  douche chill moments on the scott and todd show have always been todd pettengale uh and opie  referred to scott shannon  yesterday as the mvp of jocktober and i thought that was interesting  um because of course jocktober is what we do every october 
[00:11:00]  on the opie and anthony show where we make fun of  all the different radio jocks across the country scott and todd  became such a part of ona because of jocktober i mean last  october we were playing a scott and todd clip literally every week every friday we did scott and  todd day because it always delivered and i think we illustrated that in our uh in our tribute  to somebody who's meant so much to the opie and anthony show scott shannon let's let's hear the 
[00:11:30]  tribute that we played yesterday for him well let's say uh goodbye to scott shannon the  mvp of jocktober yes absolutely this as we go to break oh it's a like a battery car  i can't even feel my own nose  and we know how much you like it but they leave it to your own devices  lucy you got some explaining to do 
[00:12:00]  you can see his pp is a different color because people are always rubbing on it yeah  i'm so tired i can't sleep i want to see the boat movie  standing on the edge of something much to be funny how it feels so much i cannot say 
[00:12:30]  dump me on my head  i don't think that's what that is  i can't feel my own nose  is this ever happening you're all scratched up you got pine needles coming out of your skin 
[00:13:00]  you're sweating and they get home they go like it it's a little crooked isn't it  i got a tree on my house  how do you not get emotional i think anything you put with that song 
[00:13:30]  will make it emotional but how does that how do you not i feel like we're saying goodbye to a friend  now as opposed to celebrating you know one of radio's dinosaurs finally leaving i feel like  we're saying goodbye to a dear friend on the opian anthony show and i think that caller was right i think  lou in jersey was absolutely right we paid a better respect to scott shannon than todd ever did  you know what we got to do though what we've lost john and jeff and now we lost scott and todd we got to 
[00:14:00]  find a new show for uh jocktober that's right i mean as far as jocktober goes that was huge those were  the two best shows john and jeff who opie say always john and jeff came on overnights on k-rock  when we were there and opie used to go into the bathroom and drop a deuce before the ona show  obviously while john and jeff were on and he always commented on how much easier it slid out while john 
[00:14:30]  and jeff were playing on the radio and now scott and todd gone i mean luckily we still have terry  clifford but i don't know i don't know i'm worried about jocktober this year let's go to the phones  eight six six wow one wow eight six six nine six nine one nine six nine to be a part of the opian  anthony pre-show and we go to andrew in new jersey what's up andrew hey sam who do you think hated  each other more scott and todd or mike and the mad dog that's a great question andrew and it's  something that we brought up on ona many many times there's no denying that scott and todd 
[00:15:00]  obviously hated each other uh you could you could hear that in their show we pointed out so many  times that scott was placed on something that we coined the pay no mind list on a daily basis by todd  no matter what scott shannon brought up on that show todd would just give him nothing that said  i can't imagine anything more infuriating than have to sit next to mike francesa for five hours a day 
[00:15:30]  and depend on him for your career i can't imagine that scott and todd hated each other more than mike  and the mad dog must have hated each other i mean they not only i mean they in the middle of their  they they had the highest ratings in new york for a time and it's and they didn't retire they just  split up mad dog was like i gotta get out i gotta get out of here mikey that was all right that was my 
[00:16:00]  my mad dog um yeah they were like we got it i mad dog was like i gotta get out of here i'm gonna go to  sirius and we hear mike francesa so i have to believe that no radio duo has hated each other as much  as mike and the mad dog did you hear the good news what about francesa no he's coming back to tv  he is what channel i think it's fox sports oh i will be watching fox sports every day uh let that's 
[00:16:30]  such that is good news it's good news for the show let's go to steve the therapist what's up steve  hey good morning guys morning i gotta defend eric here i know he's the popular bayonet dummy on the  show yes you have to look at the historical significance that scott shannon plays for radio  not just in new york but in the whole country this is a guy who came to a defunct powerless station in  new jersey during a time where rock aor still ruled fm radio he brought in top 40 uh and not only did 
[00:17:00]  they do that but he brought the morning zoo format to new york uh made it the icon that it is he he's all  he was also very innovative i don't know if a lot of people know this but on the weekends he would  play the radio edit remix versions of a lot of the popular dance songs i mean you know as much as as much  as we make fun of the morning zoo format the fact that it started somewhere is kind of mind-blowing  the fact that somebody actually started that format just because it's copied everywhere now and that is 
[00:17:30]  something you can give him credit for but at the same time um he was a fool by the end of it and  that's what we that's what we always got he stayed at the party way too long way too long and i think  i think when we think about scott shannon on the opian anthony show that's the scott shannon i want to  remember not the radio innovator not the guy who changed the game but the guy who was there way too  long and and was made to look like a fool every day well there's more there's more uh comedy father 
[00:18:00]  absolutely absolutely and that's what i insist upon i'm punching out you sound great sam thank you  steve uh let's go to tommy in texas what's up tommy hey what's going on how are you hey uh i was just  calling because you know just when i get scott shannon out of my head his stupid phrases like it's a  battery car you bring it back with a tribute it brings it back in my head now i can't get it out for  another five months thanks a lot for the bullshit thank you tommy i don't think there's anybody 
[00:18:30]  who listens to ona that actually calls captain phillips captain phillips i think that this show  with some help from scott shannon has officially just renamed that the boat movie steve in kentucky  what's up steve welcome to the pre-show hey sam uh the other day on the super show um remember when  lady die was in that room with the fake dave spell showing her tits when she came out i think you or  somebody else mentioned how sweaty she was yes did something else happen in that room especially 
[00:19:00]  when she's trying to contact him you know it seems like he late he she blew him maybe and promised her  some shit she's like oh i need to talk to you now i need to talk to you i don't know maybe i mean we  did leave them alone in that room lady dying fake dave chappelle on friday's super show i don't know  exactly what went wrong what went on i know i know whatever it was it went wrong but i don't know  exactly what it was we were talking uh there was a funny moment on yesterday's show we were talking  about lady die and marion because of course now we've all seen lady die's breasts there's a picture 
[00:19:30]  floating around on twitter of lady die showing her breasts on the show and you could see my face i'm  her next to her and i've never looked so disgusted in my life it was that was natural i had no idea i was  making that face but let me play you the clip we were theorizing yesterday now that we've seen  lady die's bare chest what marion would look like naked you know marion is very judgmental as far as  friends go and she always thinks that she's better than lady die is so let's play track six 
[00:20:00]  and uh and and what the comparison might look like lady dies tits uh-huh and he almost crashed his car  they're terrible they really are terrible they're flat like not even flat the way they're supposed to be  they're flat like from top to bottom is she a flat cell like i don't know what you'd call it  they're i guess they're supposed to be big if they were inflated or something yeah they look like  deflated fucking balloons looks like she has a leak or two yeah bed buggy tits i can't hear i love  and i love how fucking marion talks about her body right looking good yeah looking good losing weight 
[00:20:30]  i don't know what's going on under her shirts those things like i think if both of her tits like  if you measured them right they're probably three feet across giant they're giant i think if we saw  marion naked i would bet a lot of money that more than one person would start puking  would just start puking just a trollish thing thing body do you know that could have went either way 
[00:21:00]  when you started that sentence you know we saw marion naked it could be like we'd be pleasantly  surprised god no you just know but no one saw we'd probably just start puking  well because we'd probably she talks about how how good she looks and you know she loves it i've  been losing weight good for her but look at my butt's smaller now it's shop look at her bubs  lady die her bubs she was showing them a lot during super show she loves showing those look  how they rest on her gut there really is nothing sexual about lady die or marion and marion is 
[00:21:30]  almost asexual because she looks kind of like a dude uh and she's got a terrible haircut and she's  always wearing sweatsuits plus she's looked exactly the same for the last 20 years lady die on the  other hand is one of the most unattractive human beings you'll ever see however she walks around  just ready to be fucked like anytime any guy does anything even remotely nice it seems like she wants

[00:36:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:36:30]  Thank you.  wrap it said like it said spice it said peppers it said uh it said uh uh spicy and sweet peppers  i'm like oh that sounds nice just at one of these uh bodega type places oh boy uh-oh went to the  corner one of those make your own salad places uh-huh burrito from a bodega you're fucking  brave i know that is make a salad for you no this is a really clean place a very respected place  oh they have very nice wraps and stuff but i started picking out those jalapenos realizing 
[00:37:00]  fuck you know you start pushing fucking 40 and you can't deal with jalapenos anymore  all right good and uh and i woke up this morning and i've been on the toilet ever since  and man i think it was puckering or something because it was just like it's doing that thing  like when you watch a horse take a dump and his butt's like i think that's something like that 
[00:37:30]  but calm down just in time yeah i don't know why i had to share that with everybody but  between that and the neutral bullet man things are a flowing all right yeah things are a flowing  yeah just the look of that it looks like you're going to be shooting that out your ass oh you want  to know what it is well thanks for asking yes what's in the neutral bullet today well you got some  leafy uh spinach uh a little bit of kale oh i took uh sam's suggestion oh and put cum in it  put cum in it directly into asshole a whole navel orange oh wow he doesn't know what a navel orange 
[00:38:00]  is but i do and a half a banana and some pineapple chunks how does it all fit in there and my boost  today because you need the boost gotta have the boost but my boost is very different than most  people's boost because it's not on the official boost list oh no they give you an official boost  off book i did go off book a nice handful of raw oatmeal to keep me full the raw oatmeal what is the 
[00:38:30]  boost supposed to do i don't know it's give you a boost that's give you a boost doesn't the whole  thing kind of give you a boost a lot of sugar in there you think uh the sales department is smart  enough to call the neutral bullet people at this point oh boy no i don't think so either not why  would there be the guy the neutral bullet people like tweet me all the time they're very excited  and i'm not i we talk about our lives that's all but people are buying these fucking things now 
[00:39:00]  because wow because uh we're talking about on the radio show or mostly me so what do you think you  would you know you would think they would call the neutral bullet people but then what like you said  before the show they have a they have a way of fucking up advertisers yeah yeah every time because the  neutral bullet people probably would just like to buy maybe a small schedule i don't even know i'm  not in contact with them in that way but they would probably like i would assume buy a small  package just to see how it goes but of course they'll fucking try to we need a five-year commitment 
[00:39:30]  a five-year commitment at a hundred thousand dollars a month like holy fuck on let let the guys dip  their toe in yeah let them let them get a little taste and see if this is for them i bought an  advertiser i'll never do it again yeah yeah never well they've asked me over the years i'm like no  i'm not bringing my people over here until you do things properly yep yeah so there you go  everyone keeping tabs on the old olympics i watched a little bit last night but then we uh switched over 
[00:40:00]  to you know the housewives because i gotta see you know how carlton's doing and i have and kaya and what  i'm lost kaya and that goes what housewife i have no idea and brandy and her fucked up nose  you don't know these people none of them this is strangers brandy was almost a supermodel but  she has a fucked up nose that drives me insane it's so horrible did it get fucked up from a nose job  i don't know i think so it has a weird like it gets like teeny yeah some people do that when they 
[00:40:30]  get those nose jobs it's teeny this one area that just throws off her whole fucking face that happened  what's his name the fucking olympic guy from kardashians what bruce jenner yeah bruce jenner's  got the skinny fucking nose there's a there's a strong rumor that bruce jenner is becoming a woman  yeah there's a picture and no one is talking about it and the kardashians the one thing i'll say about  the kardashians they they throw it out there yeah they throw all this shit out there and he looks 
[00:41:00]  like a chick and they're pointing out that it looks like he's like growing boobs or something  oh my god he's got a hairstyle there's a new picture he's got a hairstyle that's very very  popular with the women it's like a reverse dye job i guess where they dye the the the ends blonde  i just learned this yesterday by reading about it i have no fucking idea to be honest with you  and then uh and then he just had his adam's apple shaved down you know he looks like jackie o 
[00:41:30]  jackie o and this they're calling it radio silence for whatever reason none of the kardashians are  talking about it which makes people think that he just might be doing this he's actually like  his hair transforming his hair is getting longer yeah this is what they know so far his hair is  getting longer it's in a woman's style totally with the dye job thing at the the you know the edge  is whatever and he's growing his fingernails long oh boy it looks like he kind of has boobs because 
[00:42:00]  he's a guy that has kept himself in a very good shape over the years and then he shaved down his  adam's apple and then all the surgeries on the face and his lips look like he's getting collagen or  something what the fuck is bruce jenner up to and they're saying you know i was on a wheaties box for  the love of god and you would think if people are calling you calling you out on this that you would  say something he's not saying anything and none of the family is you usually get a family member  going hey fuck off this is you know olympic gold for the decathlon right what happened so i don't know 
[00:42:30]  man that's uh yeah why aren't they why isn't anybody i don't know man well we that's not even the latest  one sam i don't think go to oh that is from tmz oh never mind radio silent with family wait go back  to the headline sorry radio silent with family over changes could you read the first paragraph  yeah it says uh bruce jenner is going through some radical physical changes that could be  fundamentally altering who he is yet he is telling his family nothing tmz broke the story bruce went to 
[00:43:00]  a beverly hills plastic surgeon and scheduled surgery for a laryngeal shave which smooths out his adam's  apple uh but he told tmz i just never liked my trachea but you know what is he 60 something  trachea you should do something why would you do that surgery as a i would assume he's at least 60  because he lost his mind have you ever met him like your fucking trachea right how does that bother  your adam's apple i've never noticed my adam's apple before it's whatever it is jesus christ 
[00:43:30]  you wish it was smooth don't you wish i would shave it down i like a nice adam's apple that's pretty  good uh bruce jenner looks like billa jean king did back in the 70s yeah look and he's growing out  his nails growing out his nails oh boy why would you grow out your fingernails is that a thing guys  in hollywood are doing is that a no it's not a thing yet okay because you never know and look  that he is growing breasts this is insanity yeah because they're not like man boobs no plus he's 
[00:44:00]  an athlete he would know how to keep right away right you sure he's not sick i don't think he's got  what kind of sick turns you into a woman holy shit i don't know but no one's talking there i  just can't i know yeah running through every disease physically i mean no one be talking no no so  that's something it absolutely but i did watch the olympics a little bit no but a lot of those sports  are for privileged people uh you think were you were you able to grow up and and and do this as a 
[00:44:30]  casual sport no were you allowed to go speed skating no or do curling uh no i mean most of us  you know if you lived in a colder climate you got to ski a little bit but that's about it  yeah if i guess with the summer olympics uh for the most part if you could run fast  you'll do pretty good summer olympics you can relate to because you did a lot like a run you  did a lot of those sports you're kind of growing up and just fooling around your backyard or whatever 
[00:45:00]  but winter sports that's for rich people you you had to have money to do most of these sports don't  you think we had a curling team in my high school but i was never a curling team no oh wow there you  go that was good so you got to do it quick i realized that because i was gonna that was good  you saw the speed skating thing yeah yeah they took the gold away from that guy yeah it was like  right after the race was done i guess there were a couple of brothers twin brothers twin brothers 
[00:45:30]  right and they had uh medaled uh but it looked like they were going to get the silver and the the bronze  right and this other guy uh comes through the timing you know the the timing gate whatever it is at  the end and they have his time and it's a gold medal run he needed like something point seven  yeah and he got something point seven too and they love the nose they looked and went oh no we're  gonna take a one like hundredth of a second off of your time why i guess because the uh uh they looked 
[00:46:00]  and i it looked like his hand was over the line first but it had to be when your your skate is over  the line but isn't that automatic you think it's not automatic i i don't know i guess they review the  picture the photo finish in this day and age they can't put something on the skate to make it automatic  you think right when you run road races it's just automatic now yeah was it in your shoe you get  uh oh god i have to say this word you get a chip what's that that you put on your sneaker and then  your time is you know automatic yep so you would assume they could do that with the skating you'd 
[00:46:30]  think but they they took a look and decided no huh yeah so they gave it to the uh brother one of the  brothers right and uh took it away from this guy right who then gets the silver i guess and then he had  to cry like a little bit he had a bitch his way on the ice he had to cry like a little with his  little ice skates once you go do a twirl and fucking wine right snap out of it yeah go grab a  girl and go fucking figure skating doubles you right go figure eight and yell ta-da stupid 
[00:47:00]  yeah that's gotta be pretty devastating you know broke down like a little bitch a little bitch  uh but that is it is uh pretty cool to watch those motherfuckers i kind of like the speed skating  i'm enjoying that it's fucking insane how how fast those guys are going yeah how fast do they go  how how they can uh seven miles an hour it's not very fast um but when they when they turn and  they're leaning into those some of those turns it just looks like they should slide right out 
[00:47:30]  the fucking wall amazing it's fucking amazing what else was on oh oh the very uh the big story  last night was an inspirational story from canada right of course with the uh freestyle moguls  and uh you got the gut whatever the fuck oh the cp brother yes yes and they can't stop talking  are you a human being or not did that affect you that that that little video package they put  together no it didn't why he just didn't why does that pull at your heartstrings annoyed me 
[00:48:00]  because it was why pandering well there is look like it was pandering uh i appreciate a brother's  you know love for his uh brother right that's great and uh the fact that the guy's got cerebral palsy  and that's great no no any new sentence okay all right jesus so you're just adding on all the  things that were great uh the fact that he was with his brother in uh vancouver right and uh and  now in sochi and uh it's it is that right there is the end of it but when they start putting the 
[00:48:30]  fucking that that the music and the the fuzzy lens and and getting people to start crying  is just knock it the fuck off the sunrise shot yeah the sunrise the sunrise shot where you don't  really see the person he's walking childhood walking to somewhere yeah they always have to  walk somewhere during a sunrise yeah those video packages where you're going and it was all well 
[00:49:00]  and fine but breakfast the package yes the little package that's fine but then they they showed him  to his run right and he wins a gold medal right it's fucking amazing second time right yeah yeah  the guy tore it up and um they show his brother this is alex billet what's his name billet dee  alex billet dee billet dee billet dee and uh there he is there's his brother and there's his brother  billet dee he he wins and they show his brother frederick and uh he's cheering of course right 
[00:49:30]  they keep the camera on him a little too long every time because he has just shit flying out of his mouth  his whole chin was wet he was literally drooling well that's i know i understand it's an illness  i cp i understand but his parents are right there right you know the tv cameras are on you right  wipe the kid's mouth for the love of christ they probably have given up on wiping his mouth at this 
[00:50:00]  point you know what all the other days of the year you could wipe his not wipe his mouth on the  olympics when your other brother when your your other son wins the gold right and you know the camera's  gonna be on young frederick right wipe his fucking mouth he was it was it was foaming  spit but you can't coming down his chin but that stuff doesn't come through the tv you're gonna be  all right no i saw it you saw the parents were actually instead of they were actually concentrating  on the moment and the win instead of worrying about the aesthetics right or perhaps their child's 
[00:50:30]  drooling to make sure the other kid looks good and there they are hugging after he won the gold medal  i thought that was a great moment last night what's the uh what's the story the kid want to  get several palsy and his brother's just in the olympics yeah there's like a six-year difference  between the two yeah i believe the kid with the cerebral palsy has is older actually he's the older  brother yeah right so and uh you know he really does cheer it up for the he's an inspiration to  very nice sure he is he said that yeah he did say that you gotta have these little personal stories 
[00:51:00]  i hate the personal fucking story all right you don't like you always try to dig and find tragedy  like they found uh what it is that there was uh one of the one of the american female um skiers i  guess she was doing the the slalom okay something with the poles whatever the one with the poles are  right and um was a giant slalom uh no was it the wacky slalom it was yeah you know watch the poles 
[00:51:30]  don't fucking let them go on the other side of your skis yeah well okay regular slalom probably oh it was  it was the american girl it was a third olympics or a fourth olympics or some shit like that and she  had medaled in two right and uh then she got the bronze last night um so so uh they have that story  and it was great and then they go and her grandfather who died last year and there he is  like he's got a couple they show a picture of me like he's got like the two gold medals that she  already won but on him and it's like what the fuck they gotta find a dead relative right a fucking 
[00:52:00]  disabled relative some fucking tragedy they gotta dig up why can't they have just a nice wholesome story  just why does it you know why does it have to be something like that and everyone's grandfather dies  everyone's got some tragedy that's barely tragedy right you just assume that's gonna happen  right guy looked old guess what my grandfather's died before i was two there you go they die there  you go they're gonna die a lot sooner really opie why don't you tell us about it as we do this radio 
[00:52:30]  documentary on you right greg opius got into radio yet his grandfather never saw him do radio  do you wish your grandfather could have seen you i sure do  but then greg opius overcame this tragedy and went on to that's what they do yeah i mean enough with 
[00:53:00]  grandfathers dying that just happens not tragic oh my god are you kidding me god please if your  grandfather's still alive by the time you're 10 years old consider yourself lucky most of them  will walk around the house like those old dogs with cataract eyes and their hair missing  they smell bad you're kidding me they gotta be grandma a grandma will fucking survive a while for  you she'll fucking still get by that stove and start rattling some pots and pans for you but old 
[00:53:30]  school grandpas right no they were dropping at 60 62 yeah old school grandpa old school grandpas i mean  this yeah you know the newer generation grandpas they're hanging in there a little longer but  not our generation we didn't really see our do you remember your grandpa i remember my grandfather on  my mom's side how old were you though uh let me think actually probably 17 when he died well that's  pretty impressive yeah yeah it wasn't too bad nice he was a grouchy old fuck oh they all were 
[00:54:00]  uh francis my grandmother francis francis why don't you order up some chinks really oh yeah  chinese food he'd come in when we're eating chinese food be like yours all look like you're eating  chinks it's like yes grandpa we're eating chinks he always he old school oh wow oh yeah just sitting  in that fucking chair yeah that was molded to him and uh watching the mets that was his thing 
[00:54:30]  every single time i walked in that house i'd walk up the stairs look to the left and there he was  in that chair watching the mets listening to watching ralph kiner ralph kiner kiner's corner  bob lindsey yep he just died uh yeah 91 and who was the other uh and uh murphy uh bob murphy  bob murphy was it bob lindsey to know bob murphy and lindsey nelson jesus i should know this ralph 
[00:55:00]  kiner lindsey nelson and bob murphy bob burphy yeah i like this the story with the cp kid i mean look  don't get me wrong i'm not a complete fucking animal i i do i understand and i i think it was  very nice the way they get along and everything and how inspirational right uh the brother is to the  olympic uh uh skier brother but uh they just go too far with with the pieces with the dramatic 
[00:55:30]  inspirational pieces and again i understand what jimmy's saying it's it's a big moment the parents  want to be into it but you know what carry a little fucking napkin gave the kid a little mouth wipe  the cameras are on him they're on him they know the cameras are on him yeah i don't know all right  i and i was distracted i couldn't enjoy the moment see i couldn't watch the moment and be like oh 
[00:56:00]  oh because all i was like i was like ah but you're enjoying the moment because they told you to enjoy  the moment because this kid has a you know a cp yeah maybe that's it right yeah and then they  couldn't stop showing him what's up with bob costas and his eye it's getting holy shit it's  both eyes now what what's going on dude it's both eyes now his his fucking uh olympics is about him  and his eyes his left eye was right and now it's his right eye too what is it i don't know i think  it's uh i think it's ricin i think the russians are fucking trying to kill him he's officially blind 
[00:56:30]  but he's not telling anybody another story of courage what is going on with his eyes i don't know  i think it's uh pink eye pink eye goes away quickly i think i think yeah i think that goes  away within a few days i think he's got some kind of proper attention some kind of eye infection how  do you get that i don't want to get i know i'm watching just going i don't want to get that shit  it was his left eye but it seems like it's gone to both eyes to both eyes now 
[00:57:00]  and he's got the glasses on and his eyes are just runny and red and the left one's half shut  i don't oh it's terrible i don't remember him wearing glasses so i guess he can't get contacts  in at this point yeah yeah no he can't get a contact in there i don't remember him i think he  usually uh goes without the glasses like a kitten on the sarah mclaughlin commercial yeah his eyes  you know when he wakes up how crusted shut those fucking eyes are probably takes him the whole day  just to uncrust his eyes i asked for this yesterday the retired winter olympic sports oh right 
[00:57:30]  we got the list yeah because they they used to do some wacky things there used to be something  called bandy bandy the hell's that ice hockey with a ball instead of a puck that don't sound  very good why would you do that yeah is that what the expression bandy about oh probably comes from  very good jim norton you would do well on jeopardy yes i went out for jeopardy there was a high  i didn't shut up shut up i know now i'm smiling because now i i how is this going to sound after 
[00:58:00]  my last lie there's no way i can sell this after my smiling and then you're trying to trick us and  you go all right yeah yeah i didn't get on i'm in high school i was i missed it by two people  see you're just laughing he's now he's not even a smile he's laughing i missed it by two people what  does that even mean i don't know uh by the way we have curling on there's i think she's uh swedish  there's a swedish broad with dark hair and ridiculous blue eyes yeah she's very sexy 
[00:58:30]  incredibly sexy if you can find a picture of her just so the boys could appreciate her yes punch  her up i don't know if they're playing right now but who's playing the curling right now uh it's china  in the u.s yeah well that's what they're showing who knows what's live anymore oh it's live okay  uh so then another retired winter olympic sport yeah military patrol they had to do cross-country  skiing ski mountaineering and then rifle shooting wow so what they cross-country ski then climbed a bit 
[00:59:00]  and then shot yeah then there was the ice stock the german variant of curling competitors  uh slide ice stocks i guess that would be ice blocks block ice it's stolen jewish arch  over an ice surface aiming for a target or to cover the longest distance uh-huh uh then there was  ski joring what the hell i think that's how you say that ski joring a person on skis is pulled by 
[00:59:30]  dogs horses or or a form of mechanized uh transportation such as a snowmobile wow so that's  some like gladiator shit that's sketching yeah exactly they're sketching sled dog racing they got  rid of winter uh pentathlon what is that cross-country skiing shooting downhill skiing fencing horse  riding fencing and then horse riding they put fencing into the summer olympics right speed skiing 
[01:00:00]  this is insane oh and i remember i think this was still going on when we were like very young  i think point them downhill and see this is downhill in a straight line as quickly as possible  i do believe this this used to be on wide world of sports or something yeah and they would hit  ridiculous speeds could you find maybe a clip of that that's not her that's not her beautiful too  yeah the one i'm thinking of has very dark hair and like crystal blue eyes uh downhill in a straight 
[01:00:30]  line as quickly as possible that's crazy it's that's insane i bet a lot of people got hurt because  even in is this one oh that's a speed record these are like ski speed records in 97 i guess they were  doing this just point them downhill  hey yeah scoot  he's in a good tuck position  wow he's going pretty fast 
[01:01:00]  get the fuck out of here  there are so many ways to get fucked up doing that  well  he still fell at the end  right  wow  holy shit  that's fast  there's a camera under the uh like i kind of like a gopro almost  right  this i think is uh i think a guy died doing this i feel like a guy died doing this probably a good  15 20 years ago  uh i said the swiss team jim  the chick opie's looking for is on the swiss team i thought i said that or did i say you did i 
[01:01:30]  think you said swiss  so you got that you got speed skiing downhill in a straight line as quickly as possible  synchronized skating is not an olympic sport anymore  eight to twenty skaters skate as a team  yuck  how boring is that  there she is  oh  get a good picture  uh you gotta like  look at that  oh wow  yeah  yeah  that's pretty solid isn't it  fucking eyes  nice right  piercing  snow shoeing  race wearing snow shoes 
[01:02:00]  that sounds  and then ski ballet  choreographed routines performed going down a smooth snow  i remember that  that's that's relatively recent  i remember that one too  and it looked so stupid  right  they're trying to be graceful like they would on skates  but it's like they got these big skis on  right  and it just looks like they're lumbering on on the snow  i think they got rid of that one only a few olympics ago  that's gotta be  right  so  oh my nose is tough  did you see um  did you see the guy that took the gopro down the uh downhill mountain 
[01:02:30]  uh uh  the men's  the men's downhill mountain  yeah this is  well this is an older clip  but  it's a man dancing on skis  you can't be graceful with the poles  he is though  i wonder why they got rid of this  oh this was an event  yeah  i thought this was just a guy fucking around  this is  was for medals  that's boring  how embarrassing to have a medal for that 
[01:03:00]  exactly  he's just kind of fucking skating  this is the proper language for this sport too by the way  you see the guy that took the  he's a commentator for nbc  and he wanted to show you what the men's downhill was all about  so he went down with a gopro  and then another  no not even a gopro  a camera  really  to get that  that first man perspective  holy fuck 
[01:03:30]  if you haven't seen that video out there  go look it up  it's amazing  that's amazing when you watch them  going around those curves  but he doesn't have any ski poles  it's the men's downhill  i'm sure he's going a little slow  but not  i mean he's going pretty fucking fast  and he's got a  he's got a camera  i think this is it  he's intimidating  intimidating  let's go have a look at it  pushing out hard  it's already quite rough and bumpy  and you're on to this first  tight turn  fuck  oh my god  this is called the 2-orban 
[01:04:00]  better come out higher this turn  because we're setting up  for the sequence  how good is this  a guy can hold a camera  and toss  that's what i was thinking  no ski poles  and it looks like he has a gopro  on the tip of one of his skis  jesus  good speed down here  46%  just ran a little bit wide  coming out  they get a blue streak  so you don't lose your way  yeah that's relatively new  wow  that is an insane start 
[01:04:30]  to the men's downhill  now you've got the toughest part  of the course coming up  over the russian trampoline  massive flight  he catches air  you'd be dead if you tried that  you'd just be dead  this guy's no kid either  no 
[01:05:00]  he must have competed or something  hell yeah  that's crazy  that's crazy  it looks like he's going pretty fast  right  yeah  yeah  he's moving  and obviously he's not doing an olympic run  but uh  this is crazy  my legs  my legs  are burning up  haha  we've still got the two biggest jumps  on the course to come  wow  the first of these  is the leg jump  oh my god  look at how steep that is  straight down 
[01:05:30]  this is a real crazy  he's holding a camera  right  i don't understand how you can do that  i thought this was pretty impressive  where's the jumps  wow  are you in all of them  i guess  that is one of the most testing  olympic downhill courses  i guess you get a medal 
[01:06:00]  i've ever seen  and i raced five  and i've skied four with a camera  that's tough  that guy's a fucking show off  yeah put that up for your legs  wow  what are we  oh and a show on facebook and twitter  so we'll uh  we'll put that video up there for you  if you haven't seen it yet  so  yeah  wow  that's intense  what else about the olympics  that was about it i guess  last night  yeah  the highlights  those  what's going on with the  the snowboarding course or something 
[01:06:30]  i don't know  i guess the pipe's a little dodgy  uh this time around  really  yeah yeah  they're doing it uh  i'm not even sure when  because it's  goddamn time difference  right  but um  sean white  i guess goes today  is he the tomato kid  he's the redhead  yeah  the tomato  but he cut his hair  they did a little piece on him  the flying tomato i think  yeah  what was his tragedy  uh well  when he was on the pipe  attempting something  and went up  and and came crashing down  on his back  on the lip of the pipe  and had to go to the hospital 
[01:07:00]  and everything  so they had this whole  dramatic thing  of him being on the pipe again  and right  you know  oh what do i do  oh  i can't get over this  um  i think he's scared  did you see the snowboarder  that uh slammed  the back of her head  ow  and cracked her helmet  right in half  whoa  really i didn't see that  oh my god  that was the other night  it was a slam back  just how her skis caught  or something  just flew her backwards  really hard  and just cracked her helmet  right in half  i don't know what it is 
[01:07:30]  about the winter olympics  they aren't  they really aren't as  watchable  as uh  the summer olympics  they don't have the same  like watchability  right  there's the video  watch  see that crack  how she just slams backwards  yeah she really  cracked her helmet  right in half  die  no she's cool  she finished the course  she wanted to finish  anyway  damn  wait after this  she got up and finished  yeah she laid there  for a little bit  maybe a minute  maybe two minutes  and then she got up 
[01:08:00]  and finished  did that hurt her time  these fucking overachievers  jesus christ  they're in their early 20s  some of these fucking people  and the teens  and they're you know  at the olympics  crazy  we're gonna get help here  uh ryan in virginia  thank you ryan  yeah  what's up buddy  hey  so i don't know  if there's any video of it  because it happened  during a practice run  but in 92  there was a speed skier  from switzerland  that during his run 
[01:08:30]  collided with a snow machine  that had to be  absolutely brutal  so i wonder if sammy  can get off of that  and find that video  real quick for us  that that's  i do remember that  okay that was 92  yeah he was speed skiing  and went off course  or something  and hit a fucking  snow machine  hit a snow machine  and secondly uh  cumia you don't think  the winter olympics  are watchable  there's no black guys  in it  you gotta love  the winter olympics  yeah  thank you  i didn't say  it's not watchable  i said it doesn't have  the watchability 
[01:09:00]  of the summer olympics  i think the summer  the summer olympics  do much better  as far as  ratings go  yeah  than the winter olympics  it's just  there's some pretty obscure  shit in the winter olympics  that's left  i know they got rid of  a lot of  pretty lame sports  but there's still  some obscure shit  i mean i can't get  into curling man  i don't understand it  i don't even know  how you score it  how do you make  it's shuffleboard  that's all  you gotta get  your little fucking  stone in the middle  of the target  and then you gotta  prevent your other  the other team  from doing the same  by knocking on ice 
[01:09:30]  and you get some  and you get to sweep  a little bit  to slow down the stone  make it go faster  curve it a little bit  toward the button  it's called a button  right  i always think of  jimmy going  shuka shuka shuka  that's what they're  doing with  little brooms  that's exactly  what they're doing  shuka shuka shuka  gotta be a good  shuka shuka shuka  yeah  alright boys  thanks ryan  what an aggressive  caller  i know  i hate the way  curling the way  the person who  pushes it out  slides perfectly  because you know  the form  it's like you're  doing a yoga pose

[01:23:00]  Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine with another Dr. Steve Medical Minute.  Hello, Dr. Steve.  I'd like to have make some anal sex, but I'm worried about the consequences.  Can you talk about that?  Thank you.  This is a good question.  Other than the obvious things like sexually transmitted diseases,  anal sex can increase the risk of two principal problems.  Number one, infection, and then trauma.  Because the rectum is fragile, there's an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases 
[01:23:30]  like herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and both directions.  Oral sex after anal sex, the so-called chili dog,  also exposes the receiver to diseases that can be transmitted through contact with fecal matter,  including hepatitis A, but more commonly,  nausea and vomiting from gut bacteria being introduced into the stomach.  A really horrific variety of food poisoning.  Trauma to the rectum can cause fissures and hemorrhoids, 
[01:24:00]  but one recent study showed that anal intercourse caused a loosening of the anal muscles,  but did not lead to loss of bowel control.  Most importantly, just don't be stupid.  Make sure you know your partner, use tons of lube, and go nice and easy.  Sex should be fun.  Don't turn it into a shitty experience.  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine, Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern,  right here on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On the next American War Stories,  battleground, Iraq. 
[01:24:30]  Robert Kelly deploys and within an instant realizes no man can prepare for war.  We thought we were going to starve,  so we brought little bars and stuff,  where there's going to be no food.  I gained 30 pounds in Iraq.  You go to the buffet, there's Chinese food, mac and cheese, barbecue, pizza.  You can walk up to this ice cream  and get as many ice cream bars and sunnies as you want. 
[01:25:00]  But no matter how rich the rewards,  every American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there, I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes,  you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one, and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more.  So tune in as we chronicle the victories  and the defeats for American hero Bob Kelly.  I broke my knee, man!  On the next American War Stories.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back 
[01:25:30]  on Sirius XM.  Best news ever.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best on you?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best on you?

[01:26:00]  Wow, Ginger is 80 years old today.  From Gilligan's Island.  The Big 8-0.  And the professor just dropped 10.  Yeah.  How many left?  There's Ginger.  Marianne.  Marianne.  I think that's it.  That's it, huh?  I do believe.  Who went first, Lovey?  Probably Lovey.  Lovey, or was it Jim Bacchus?  I would go with Lovey.  My God, Lovey on Jim.  Lovey.  And Sarah Palin. 
[01:26:30]  That's your girl.  Your girl's 50 today.  I don't think it's my girl, I swear.  We were talking earlier before the show about a few political things going on, and Opie  loves putting the your boy tag on various politicians.  Well, I said your boy, Governor Christie, is in trouble.  Your boy, Governor Christie.  I'm like, my boy?  Now they're looking at flight logs for his helicopter.  There's a strong possibility that Governor Christie flew over the George Washington Bridge after  the fucking lane closures. 
[01:27:00]  For nothing more than just to look at the traffic jam and chuckle.  They want his helicopter flight log.  Yeah, they want the flight log who was on there, because it might be one of the guys that  was...  He was up in the air that day.  They know that much.  And now they want to see if they took an old...  Took a little ride up the Hudson River to see how traffic was on the GWB.  Your boy's in trouble, brother.  Well, your boy de Blasio, Opie, just through the State of the City address, start opening 
[01:27:30]  up that old pocketbook.  He's nuts.  He's fucking nuts.  He wants to pay for everything.  He wants to elevate everybody.  He's saying it's great.  He's going to elevate everyone else.  It's not penalizing the successful people.  You're making more success stories.  Look, and I swear to you, it's annoying, but I have enough money.  In the end, I know I have enough money.  It's just really annoying when they want to take more from you.  But this de Blasio is going to really fuck over the middle class. 
[01:28:00]  He hates anyone.  They're the ones that are going to get really fucked where they're going to notice major  changes in their lives.  Like, in the end, I'll just be annoyed, but I'll be able to do everything I'm doing  today.  I know that.  But man, I'm from a massive middle class family.  No one is doing anywhere near as well as me.  Well.  And they're going to get hurt by this de Blasio bullshit.  Yeah.  What, to bring up the poor people?  Yeah, yeah.  It's all about the poor for him. 
[01:28:30]  He's a communist.  He's literally a communist.  He's the closest to a communist we've had in a very long time.  He's a commie supporter.  What's some of the shit he wants to do?  Well, of course, the wealthy.  We're talking about the mayor of New York City for the people that really don't know.  The wealthy will be taxed.  Again.  Again.  And it's funny because he goes, you know, to give a little more and this little more  and little more that all these fucking Democrats take, it adds up to be a lot of more. 
[01:29:00]  And I wouldn't even mind the little more if I knew that it was being spent properly.  But you know the government doesn't know how to spend your money properly.  Let's start there.  It's going towards pre-K, pre-kindergarten.  But Governor Cuomo wanted to pay for that shit.  But that isn't it.  And you're right.  Governor Cuomo came in and said, look, we've got enough in the state budget where we can  have universal pre-K for all the kids in your five boroughs in New York City.  That would be one less bill for the city.  And this asshole goes, no.  He said, no.  You know why?  It's not about just that. 
[01:29:30]  It's about redistribution of wealth.  That's what he wants to do.  Right.  He wants to take money from the wealthy that he calls it, which a half million dollars in  New York City is not the wealthy, by the way.  It's middle class people are considered, I guess, wealthy in his book.  He wants to take that and redistribute their wealth because that's the commie way to do  it.  And this guy is a fucking communist.  And good luck.  Good luck, New York City.  I'm glad I don't live in New York City because I'd be outraged at this fucking prick. 
[01:30:00]  I'll bring in my tax bills for the people.  It's amazing.  It's fucking amazing.  It's going up.  How much you spent to live in this stupid city.  A lot of programs you're going to be hearing about.  A lot of entitlement programs.  A lot of money being poured into areas that gives nothing back.  And he'll say, you know, oh, it's great.  Everyone's going to come up.  No, you can't. 
[01:30:30]  You can't redistribute wealth and make things like ambition or fucking creativity, things  like that.  So it's just a waste.  Right.  Fucking waste.  Let me say hi to Petey in Texas.  Petey's a good man.  What's up, Petey?  Well, fellas, I wanted to tell you a little something about, you know, like wanting to  take from the top 1%.  Man, they're mobile.  They can leave.  And on top of that, you know, here on the talk radio, y'all down in Texas, go ahead,  secede, go ahead, secede. 
[01:31:00]  Well, fellas, let me tell you, my family's been on our ranch now for damn near 100 years.  Because my great-grandfather was doing well.  And you know what's going to happen?  God forbid Texas secedes.  You won't have to worry about the knucklehead politicians.  You guys will vote them out, because you'll be paying 12 bucks a gallon for gasoline.  They need not be dicking with the top 1%.  And they surely don't need to be dicking with the oil people.  I don't think the de Blasio thing is about the 1%. 
[01:31:30]  I really don't.  No, it's about redistribution of wealth on all levels.  I think this dips deep into the middle class, some of his ideas.  You can't bring...  And those are the people that are going to get fucking hurt.  He's like, we're going to raise the floor, he says.  Raise the floor of, you know, so everyone can be risen up to a level.  And he's saying the only way to do that is to lower the ceiling then.  You're taking from people that have achieved something, built wealth, done stuff, 
[01:32:00]  and it's not an investment, it's a handout.  People think that everyone who has money is Bernie Madoff.  Like, when you take the top 1%, it's like, yeah, those are guys that's easy to go.  They're portrayed as evil.  Fuck them, they're scumbags, they do nothing, they just capitalize off other people's work.  I understand that emotion, but I don't feel a desire to give anymore.  I fucking work every day.  Right.  Every fucking day, and I go on at night.  I'm not concerned with people who aren't willing to do that at all. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Let me ask y'all, son.  Uh-oh.  What?  What happened?  Let me ask y'all, son.  Y'all are obviously middle class.  Y'all go to work every day.  Oh, middle class.  Do what you need to do to make y'all's money.  Well, shit, what the hell y'all are going to, I mean, you're going to see a bunch of y'all  get smart and leave them states with them freaking high asses.  Well, that's exactly it, too.  It's, uh, DeBazio was talking about, you know, it's time we, um, we have one city.  He was saying one city, you know, where everybody is, is, uh, equal. 
[01:33:00]  He wants to see quality.  He wants to raise the minimum wage.  He wants all kinds of fucking, uh, programs.  And, and the corporations aren't going to run things anymore.  When these people leave, who's going to pay for anything?  What incentive does a rich person have or a corporation that employs a fuckload of people  and is the, the lifeblood of any city, uh, what incentive do they have to stay here when  they could just leave and go to a, a more friendly, uh, city? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Our third world country, like a lot of these corporations, they will pack their shit up  and they'll haul ass to some Punjabi country.  God only knows where, but I know one thing.  It sure as shit ain't going to be in the great U.S. of A.  You don't remember the New York city with, uh, fucking Dinkins and Mayor Lindsey and,  and, and, and Koch.  It was, you know, it was devastating.  We'll see.  Thanks, Petey.  Yo, y'all take care now. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, right on, Petey.  They just waste so much money.  I don't respect, I don't, I don't trust them.  They waste, it's not like every dollar you give goes to something good because I'm fine  with that.  Right.  It's just the fucking waste and the middle management and the overpayment.  And nobody who works in government gives a fuck because they don't have any interest  in the company they work for.  And it's a never ending supply of money.  It doesn't end.  If, if, if the money supply gets cut off, people go to jail for it.  Right.  They, you have to give them money.  So what incentive do they have to spend it wisely? 
[01:34:30]  It's, it's, it's amazing.  It is amazing.  And, and we just keep getting more and more fucked.  Good luck, New York City.  Cause I don't care.  I would love to see New York City go back to the death wish days and fucking just the,  the, the, the, the cracked ends, the busted down.  Remember what the Bronx used to look like?  Holy fuck.  The burnt out buildings, just fucking square miles.  You think it's going to go that bad?  Uh, probably not. 
[01:35:00]  No, I don't think so.  But I, I real, I wish it would.  It's going to get annoying though.  You're going to see a definite, um, a definite tick down though, in the quality of life as  they call it.  Uh, Giuliani was a big quality of life mayor.  Get rid of the squeegee guys, clean up the shit.  Let's get, you know, sanitation crews hauling garbage away.  Let's get a lot of police out there.  So you don't get a lot of these nuisance, uh, crimes and whatnot.  And then Bloomberg did a good job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As much as we kind of, he kept it going because he was a businessman and he saw what it took. 
[01:35:30]  And de Blasio absolutely hated what Bloomberg did with the city.  Oh yeah.  I think it ran pretty well.  What changed?  I think it ran pretty well for most.  Bloomberg, uh, uh, how do you, how do you hate that?  De Blasio gets out there now and talks about changing the city in this way, like people  are mad.  Like there was the way it is.  Yeah.  Like there was major problems with the city.  There were, there wasn't any major problems with the city.  I hate to inform this idiot, but there's always going to be income inequity and there's 
[01:36:00]  always going to be wealth inequity.  It's part of the capitalist system.  You communist dick bag.  And that's the only way it works.  There will always be this inequity because there will always be people that are a little  more creative than other people, a little harder working, a little more dedicated or  a little more lucky.  You'll get that thrown into, but, but that's the, that's the world we live in.  No, it's not the world we live in.  I hate that.  Fuck.  It's really not the world we live in.  No, no. 
[01:36:30]  We live in a culture where everyone gets a trophy.  Everyone gets a trophy.  The every, Oh man, that fucking thing.  You saw that.  I saw that.  We've done that bit a million times.  I wasn't even going to bring it up.  But to read it was, was, what was it?  Uh, guy sent me a letter, a letter that was sent to all the parents for his kindergarten  class.  I read it like his kindergarten class to try to get it straight.  And, uh, and then you get the fucking, there's just so many assholes out there.  What do you mean on Twitter?  What do they sound like?  I don't feel like doing a voice. 
[01:37:00]  Come on.  I don't like being on the spot.  I don't feel like doing a voice.  I get embarrassed.  Not just for a second.  Err.  This guy is like, what's wrong with being nice?  Ah, nice.  They're just trying to be nice.  There's no individuality anymore is what it is.  You dummy.  They're just trying to be nice.  What's wrong with that?  And then other guys are like, oh, I'm fine with this because I was the fucking weirdo kid 
[01:37:30]  in class that didn't get any valentines.  I didn't get any fucking valentines.  Valentines?  I was one of those kids too.  I was a little, I was, I was very small for my age and all that shit.  I wasn't getting valentines.  So you'd rather get a forced valentine?  Right.  What would that do?  And then, well, you want to read this thing?  Oh, it's fantastic.  So, but the guys are like, I'm fine with it because this is what happened to me.  That's, you're missing the point entirely.  You're totally missing the point.  And by the way, if everyone gets one, it means that they, they mean nothing. 
[01:38:00]  Exactly.  So you're still not getting one.  So, so at that point, I would, I would suggest you don't do it at all.  Right.  Because this is ridiculous.  It's phony.  And then you notice that you have to give valentines to guys.  Yes.  Everyone.  Did you notice that point?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck is that?  It's everyone.  Read that, Jimmy.  This was an actual letter or newsletter that goes home to the parents, I guess.  It's called Kindergarten News.  Dear Parents, Valentine's Day is always a fun time in kindergarten.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:38:30]  The children are already expressing their excitement.  Boys and girls wish to exchange cards in school.  May do so on Friday, February 14th.  Ooh, okay, good.  Sounds good.  Nice.  Yes.  The children should sign 16 cards, one for each student in the class.  Mrs., whatever her name is, students should sign and bring in 15 cards.  After signing each card, place in the envelope.  Please do not put any names on the outside of the envelope.  That was the point that I was like, oh my God. 
[01:39:00]  So it's completely meaningless, yeah.  Meaningless.  So you don't even, because, and here's why.  They don't want you making maybe a little special one for someone else.  Like if you do like somebody.  Right, you might put an extra, you might put a heart or something.  Yes, yes.  They don't want you doing that.  So it's random.  You just sign the fucking card and they grab them up?  Well, the reason is this will make it easier for the children to pass out the cards themselves.  How about they know the kids' names and you hand them out that way?  And stop with the bullshitting. 
[01:39:30]  It's making it easier.  Now you're just flat out lying.  Why don't you say what that really is about?  They will give one to each person in their class.  If your child chooses to exchange Valentine's cards in school, he or she should have one for each classmate.  This will avoid hurt feelings.  Hurt feelings?  Please wait until Friday, February 14th.  Can you believe that, though?  But nothing, there's no individuals.  You can't be an individual.  You can't have a one-on-one kind of building thing. 
[01:40:00]  Look at Jimmy's face.  I have mixed feelings on it.  Oh.  But the hurt feelings thing is part of life.  You're going to get hurt after you're out of the protection of a school system.  You're right.  And I agree.  And I hate the mentality of this way it will be easier.  Yeah.  The reality is no one who picks up a gun and walks through a school shooting is one of the popular kids.  It's always the... 
[01:40:30]  And I'm not saying you should gear every school policy.  Yeah, that's crazy.  But when you look at the fucking amount of people snapping and picking up guns and killing their classmates...  It's not a lot.  But I mean, compared to how it ever was before...  But school shootings are way up, and this shit has been going on...  School shootings are way up.  But...  Well, so they seem, I guess...  No, the stats are fucking skewed because they're saying...  They don't say school shootings.  They say shootings done by children.  Right.  And this is 18 or even 21, they've said, and younger. 
[01:41:00]  It's not just school.  They're adding in gang members...  No, no.  I'm not talking about that.  ...who are killing...  Well, no, they are.  But I'm talking about that.  But when you say overinflated numbers of school shootings and say, well, they're on the rise,  they're not.  But when I watch the news, there's more school shootings now than there were when I was young.  But I got a point.  Huh?  The school...  All right.  So if you think that...  I don't think so.  Absolutely.  Which is up for argument, obviously, if you listen to Mr. Kulmia.  But this culture's been around for a while, so it doesn't make your point.  But it...  We've done this PC shit for a while now, and school shootings are supposedly up. 
[01:41:30]  I'm not saying that that's the...  I'm not saying that you have to give out cards so you don't get shot.  I don't mean that.  I'm saying it's a...  When I was a kid, how often did you hear, when you were younger, about somebody murdering...  I'm not saying it never happened, but it didn't happen at this rate.  No, you didn't hear about it at this rate either.  It was...  There wasn't national news like there is now, and they didn't really cover city-to-city  stories like that.  Well, I personally think that schools... 
[01:42:00]  There's more of them now than there were.  I think that, for whatever reason, maybe the mass coverage encourages more people to do  it.  I believe that.  It feels like it.  That could be a part of it.  I believe that, too.  But there's...  I don't like it.  I don't like it at all.  I remember...  Being a parent, I don't like it at all.  I remember when I was a kid, the kids that got fucking treated horrible.  I keep thinking of a couple of these kids, and I was one who got away with it because  I was funny, even though I should have been a fucking disaster, but I was in the middle  there.  Uh-huh.  But I remember the kids that got treated awful. 
[01:42:30]  The rest of us just fucking...  Because at that age, we didn't have the ability to go, well, you know, this is going to balance  out.  You're just not popular right now.  We were little motherfuckers.  Right.  And we were motherfuckers to people who had nothing, and we were motherfuckers to the ugly  kids.  And it was like, it didn't teach them, like, hey, life isn't always fair, because some  people got treated way better than they should have, and on the other scale, some people  got treated way worse than they should have.  And I got lucky kind of being in the middle and fucking falling between the cracks. 
[01:43:00]  So why wasn't people, why weren't people shooting each other up, like you said, when you went  to school, with all this horrid behavior going on?  I think part of it is, again, with the press, the way they cover it and stuff, that just  seems like the solution.  But I just remember the fucking, the horrible way some people got treated.  It's like, how important...  I'm not saying I...  I don't think forcing kids to give Valentine's Day cards to everybody will take away from bullying.  It's basic human nature.  I remember...  People are going to be awful to each other.  I remember the disappointment of not getting any of these, but I didn't obsess about it. 
[01:43:30]  And if you're nutty enough to where, you know, I didn't get a Valentine's Day card in kindergarten,  let me fucking snap.  And my...  No, but I don't mean it like that.  But my parents were also aware of my feelings and what I was going through, and they were  able to kind of talk to me.  I think with kids being raised by nannies and shit, because both parents have to work,  is one of the major issues going on out there.  We had parents at home that dealt with our issues every day when we came home from school.  Look at how fucked up we are.  Not you and I, but look at where you are. 
[01:44:00]  It's not like we're this model amazing society with all these...  Look at all the problems we have right now.  Right.  We were...  We're the adults.  But the solution is to take away any individuality that goes on anymore?  No.  I don't think that...  Zero tolerance laws.  And make believe human beings don't have feelings?  Yeah.  Because as soon as you get into the workplace, your boss ain't going to deal with this shit  and make sure everyone gets a Valentine's Day card, or make sure they get a raise, or  make sure they get a special treatment.  They're going to fuck with you. 
[01:44:30]  And then you're not going to be able to handle that, because you've never had to handle...  Have to handle this shit.  Kids of World War II veterans, like, you know, they didn't talk about anything.  Right.  And those kids, the veterans probably looked at, like, ah, you always got to talk about everything.  Shut up!  Like, generation to generation, we think we're getting softer and softer, and we probably  are, and it's probably the right way to go.  We absolutely are.  But, I mean, again, none of us are shit compared to the Vikings anyway, so we should all act  like, wow, they were tough in World War II.  Fuck them, too.  They didn't go fucking door-to-door with an axe like they did fucking 2,000 years ago. 
[01:45:00]  Fuck them, too.  So, like, they looked at talking about things as being a soft little pussy.  Yeah.  But then you look at how devastating it was for these guys not to talk about things.  Right.  Like, when you see these veterans, they break down, like, I wish we had that.  And so sometimes the way we look at shit, like, eh, you know what I mean?  Like, the softening isn't always bad, I don't think.  It's not an all-or-nothing thing.  Like, that is good.  I agree with that.  But then other things like this, with the kids, like, you know, something for everyone. 
[01:45:30]  I don't agree with that.  No.  I just can't agree with it.  Why would you ever excel?  Yeah, why bother?  Why would you bother excelling at anything?  Why would you bother working at anything when you're just going to be, when everyone's  going to achieve the same level of everything, why would you do anything?  That's what, that was the difference between us and the Soviet Union.  There was no ambition or drive for them to do anything, because no one was able to individually 
[01:46:00]  become successful.  It was part of the collective.  And this is such a collective thing.  Individuality is the only thing that has made this country fucking amazing over the  years, and that is going away.  They want everyone the same, same level of income, the same types of jobs.  You know, everybody's got to be a professional.  And let's not ignore the fact that not getting a Valentine's Day card sucks, but there's got  to be a better way to handle that. 
[01:46:30]  And whether the teachers hand out special Valentine's Day cards, so everyone goes home with something.  Sometimes a girl isn't going to like you, and you're going to like her.  Right.  What the fuck?  But now she's forced to give you a card?  It's phony.  I think that does more damage than anything else.  There's got to just be a better way.  Yeah.  To make sure the kids that maybe, you know, go home empty-handed are all right with that.  I don't know.  But you're not going to get to the girl anyway.  What's up?  What happens, I think, like, getting rejected by girls and not having friends is far more detrimental. 
[01:47:00]  Like, what happens in middle school or high school?  Everybody has a boyfriend or a girlfriend, or nobody's allowed to have one at all?  Right, right.  You're going to get, that's what I'm kind of saying.  It's going to come out in the wash.  Like, the good-looking guys are still going to get the good-looking girl.  Like, that's not going to change.  That type of stuff is, people are still going to talk to who they want to talk to, and date  who they want to date, and spend time after school with who they want to spend time  after school with.  But it's just these little weird things, which, in the overall scheme of things, the little  fat kid, the little ugly kid goes home with a card.  You're right.  It doesn't mean anything.  But what the people who like each other want to do, they're going to do anyway. 
[01:47:30]  But it's crazy that we're protecting all these human emotions like that.  You've got to go through that shit, unfortunately.  You really do.  When you go through some shitty times, it makes the good times that much better.  You can appreciate the good times way, way more.  That's just how it works.  My kid went to school last week with his Batman mask on.  It's one of those hardcore, really nice, solid Batman masks.  He goes, I want to wear this to school today.  I'm like, cool.  Kids are hilarious. 
[01:48:00]  I want to go to school as Batman.  I like to do that, go to work.  Right, with a Batman mask.  So he walks in with his Batman mask.  The whole class is like, oh, wow, he's got a Batman mask on.  They're into it a little bit.  The teacher, within one minute, said, oh, they were cool about it, but they're like, oh, wow, you've got a Batman mask on.  But you know, you're going to have to put that in your cubby until the end of class.  Why?  I don't know.  Is there a no mask policy for that reason? 
[01:48:30]  I think they're not allowed to just, in general, bring outside toys into the classroom.  It's zero tolerance.  But why couldn't it be, let them just wear it for a little bit, and then you slowly fade out of it.  But it was like, okay, but you've got to put that in your cubby.  And he's looking at me, I'm like, I don't fucking know.  I don't know what to fucking tell you.  I don't see a problem with a three-and-a-half-year-old walking in a classroom with a fucking Batman mask where you can still see his face. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, it's not going to fucking...  And who gives a fuck that means everyone wants to come with a fucking mask on.  It's going to distract everybody when they're doing their calculus.  Right.  But I just will never understand that shit.  Yeah, I don't know exactly how I feel about it.  It's a zero tolerance thing that I hate.  I just don't like this collective attitude.  Because when you look at the jobs years ago, like, well, you do this or else you go to college or else you just go out and get a great job.  The jobs that a lot of people would have gotten many years ago just don't exist anymore.  And they don't exist because we're progressing through computers and through fucking GM jobs. 
[01:49:30]  How many autoworkers are going to stand on a thing where a computer can do it and a machine can do it and much better?  So it's almost like all the jobs we have, or say instead of 50%, 70%, are now going to be in this industry.  It's kind of to everyone's benefit to have everyone moving forward in maybe a little bit of a better headspace and feeling better about themselves and more psyched about – I don't know.  Like, is it to our advantage to go, hey, fuck it. 
[01:50:00]  That's the way it works out when, say, half the people are not going to be qualified to do anything that is available?  If right now it's bad, where is it going to be in 20 years with, like, manual labor jobs?  You're always going to need cops and filing tough jobs like that.  The problem is it's not the majority.  I'm in this now.  I'm in this big time at this school and shit.  And you talk to any parent, they're like, what the fuck is this?  They all just get annoyed immediately.  So then you're like, well, why are they doing this then if the majority of the parents don't want it?  Do they speak out or no? 
[01:50:30]  No.  Some do.  But they'll just get shut down.  It's school policy.  It's in the school handbook.  This is just the way it is.  You know, people are shut down immediately if they bring it up.  We brought it up with the teachers.  And they go, yeah, yeah, we know how this is ridiculous.  But, you know, this is just how it is.  This is just how it is.  Why would you want everything watered down like this?  Do you understand when you come in and sign the card and don't personalize it to any one person and everyone has to get one, how watered down and meaningless it is? 
[01:51:00]  And I know it's kindergarten class.  They don't know.  But the bigger picture, this happens, this type of thing happens throughout the entire school and workplace and everything now.  So it's like, why would you want to take something and take any special, anything special out of it and just make it literally useless?  It means nothing now.  When you gave a girl a Valentine's Day and she smiled at you, that was fucking great. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  You had the butterflies.  It was special.  You got that card just for her.  You didn't get it for anyone else.  It meant something.  Right.  This means nothing.  You might as well not do it then.  You might as well just not do it.  There was a guy, he's gone now, but he said an older school, so I think it might have been like junior high or something, they give pizza parties for anyone that gets A's.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And now the other parents, I guess, are getting involved saying, well, we've got to include all.  You can't reward.  That was a story last week. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, it was?  Yeah, that kids who were getting A's got a pizza and dance party, and all the other kids got to go to the dance party later, but the kids who excelled got a little extra treat.  They got to go to A's and have some pizza.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with that?  Rewarding for excelling is now taboo.  Rewarding for working your ass off.  It's bad.  You can't do it anymore.  For the most part, you work your ass off in school, you can get A's, too. 
[01:52:30]  Period.  You really can.  A very small percentage of kids, maybe not so much.  But most kids, if they just apply themselves and worked hard and did all their homework every night, absolutely could get A's.  I have no doubt about that.  And you know what?  There may be a few that can't.  But you know what?  Not many, though.  It's basic human nature.  But others choose not to.  Others choose like, look, it's not important I get an A in trigonometry.  I'm happy with a B, B minus, and I want to go fucking play with my Xbox.  I just think we're all independent beings. 
[01:53:00]  Why the fuck do they expect us to all act the same and be on the same level of everything?  There are kids that are smart and there are kids that are little dummies.  There are kids that are very good, kids that are very bad.  And they should be treated individually.  Joe Rogan said it perfectly.  He says, when you have kids, you want to nerf the entire world.  As a parent, absolutely, I want to protect my two kids at all costs. 
[01:53:30]  But I see where this is bad.  I'd rather him come home with a little disappointment and then sit him down and try to explain it to him and talk it out with him.  You would think I'd want it the other way because you want to protect your kid.  But no, I don't want that.  I don't think it's healthy in the end.  I really don't.  This is a progressive-based curriculum and program that is thought up by these fucking people that have this weird idea that they know how to raise the entire fucking country. 
[01:54:00]  And again, I don't have any kids.  I'm just, to me, would raising them in a certain way, like let's just say that they all have a little more self-esteem from this.  Even if it's stupid, they're in kindergarten.  What the fuck did I do?  Sorry, Jim, I don't mean to interrupt, but the only reason I am is kindergarten, it's easy to say, yeah, this is kindergarten, but this shit is happening to a lot older kids where they really do understand this way more.  But if it makes you feel a little bit better and it kind of helps people who would normally have shitty self-esteem feel a little bit better, how much does it, like is it in the 20 years from now going to hurt us all where these retarded idiots are getting CEO jobs? 
[01:54:30]  Like I don't think so.  I think on this level, kindergarten, if the teachers gave every kid cards, that would be what you're talking about.  They'd go home feeling pretty good about themselves.  But then on top of it, if the kids were allowed to individualize and give out cards as well, I think that would be a pretty decent solution.  You got a card in your hand that looks the same as the other kid's card. 
[01:55:00]  Your name isn't even on the fucking thing.  And like that's supposed to make you feel any better.  Why?  You might as well pick up a piece of scrap paper.  It means nothing.  It's just, you know what, this is all for the fucking ugly kids.  It's just sad to see an ugly fucking kid.  Fuck them.  I know, but it's sad to see an ugly fucking kid who has nothing to do with...  Build up your sense of humor, you little douchebag.  Well, please, you're either going to be a comedian or you're going to walk in with a trench coat and fucking murder all of them and then yourself.  But that's, you know what I mean?  It's like these little ugly motherfuckers that don't get anything and it has nothing to do with their ability. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  They're socially awkward.  Maybe they live in a weird situation.  Let me tell you something.  They don't all grow up to be fucking killers.  No, of course not.  So, you don't think that the character that is built by somebody being judged as an ugly student, let's say, and everything that they have to go through,  you don't think there's some equity in that that later comes out in his expertise in his job as much as it does the handsome kid that gets everything and what he excels at? 
[01:56:00]  Like, don't you think there's a payoff for even that going through those terrible times?  Exactly.  Yes, I do.  But I think that there will be enough of those and enough of them where this is not going to negate that.  Like, this is just a nice little stupid thing.  This is not going to negate all of the experiences you have as an ugly motherfucker not getting girl.  Like, this is not going to change that.  They won't stop at this.  No.  No.  This is just school shit.  I've been through all the holidays already. 
[01:56:30]  There's no Halloween in my kids' school whatsoever.  They didn't have Thanksgiving.  They didn't celebrate any Christmas holidays.  I say Christmas holidays, whatever.  But any holidays around Christmastime.  Yeah.  You know.  Let's say hi to Mark, who thinks me and Anthony are idiots and Jimmy was right.  What's up, Mark?  Well, thanks for the call.  Yeah, Jim, you're right.  Oh, yeah, I love you guys, but you're idiots.  All right.  I would highly doubt I would go out.  All right.  Hold on. 
[01:57:00]  Let me address that.  Let me quickly address that, sir.  Just because I don't have kids doesn't mean I can't throw in an opinion on what the government is doing to raise our children.  And, Mark, I got two kids, so I'm right in on this.  Let me tell you something, and I hear you.  I hear you.  You're making a big deal out of the Valentine's Day thing and some of the other nice, nice things they do.  But let me tell you, it's competitive out there.  You'll see.  Don't worry.  Your son will come home with disappointment.  It gets very, very competitive. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, and you think he'll accept it easier if he's been coddled in school or?  It's not being coddled.  It's not that bad.  It's being coddled.  When you're given a useless piece of paper under the guise that it's Valentine's Day and everyone has to get one, that's being coddled.  Yeah, I think so.  I'd rather my kid have no cards when he comes home.  I don't know any different.  That's just the way Valentine's is.  Everybody gets a card.  It's no big deal.  You know what?  Let me tell you, when it comes to academics and athletics, it's more competitive than we were kids.  I'm the same age as you guys, and I'm telling you, it's way more competitive now than it is for these kids. 
[01:58:00]  You will have plenty of disappointment to deal with with your son.  And I have Beavis, by the way.  Right.  I raise little Beavis.  Right.  He looks disappointed when I don't give him a pounce cat treat.  Very disappointed.  This guy makes a good point, though.  I don't love it.  I don't love it.  Don't get me wrong.  It has maybe gone a little bit too far, but I think you've drawn a big, wide paintbrush over this whole thing with how easy it is to become when these kids are coddled.  They are not coddled.  It's competitive in different ways than it was competitive for us. 
[01:58:30]  There's different about academic competition and trying to keep people's emotions in check through this giving of every child the same things that every other child gets.  It's different.  Academic competition is great, and I think it should be harder than it was when we were growing up.  But trying to lump everyone into one thing so their emotions are all evened out is retarded.  You can't go to school in a Halloween costume. 
[01:59:00]  That's ridiculous.  You can't celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah or something because other kids will be, what, their feelings will be hurt?  Yeah, yeah.  I'd rather my kid learn about all holidays than no holidays.  Our kids do.  Our kids can do wear costumes to school.  I don't know.  I mean, maybe you picked the wrong school up.  I think, you know.  I'm starting to think that, to be honest with you, Mark.  To be honest with you, I'm starting to think that because I've seen other kids my son's age, and they go to different schools where they did go to school with Halloween.  I like that. 
[01:59:30]  But as a parent, parents are the ones who complain.  And most of these things are done because parents complain.  It's absolutely about the parents.  It's not about the kids.  Parents complained, so the school did something.  Other parents just sat there and took it.  It's like, look, the Duck Dynasty experience should show everybody what happened when enough people pushed back.  They buckle every fucking time.  Five parents complaining against 75 parents going, absolutely not, will lose every time.  And the Duck Dynasty thing is a fascinating experiment because they did bring them back, and the ratings are way down. 
[02:00:00]  Still doing very well, but not the crazy numbers they were doing.  But probably not for that reason.  They probably would have gone down.  That's just sometimes the progression of these shows.  You would think more people would watch after the controversy, though.  I think a lot of this goes back to where you guys started.  I think a lot of this traces back to the whole bullying issue, which I don't know if there's a good answer for it, but I'll tell you.  Dude, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  But I'm so sick of this bullying shit because I got to tell you, bullying is way worse than it ever was. 
[02:00:30]  It's just done differently now.  It is.  I agree.  That's what I was going to say.  Oh, okay.  They're online bullying the shit out of each other, these kids.  It's way worse than it ever was.  In the old days, when you got punched in the face for being an asshole, it kind of straightened you up a little bit.  It really did.  I agree with you.  I think that's where I was going.  I think they think they've got it under control, but it's just as bad, and now they have these policies, and they're catching maybe the wrong kids. 
[02:01:00]  It's kind of a mess.  I've had a kid who's been bullied, and he's gotten in trouble for fighting back.  So it's really, I think that's what the problem that they're trying to solve is, and they don't know how to solve it.  But I just don't want you to think that it's all that easy.  It's pretty competitive out there.  I think the old school bullying in the schoolyard is almost way better, but now the bullying has moved to online and other places.  Well, the reason it's like this is because this great generation that we think didn't do a good enough job. 
[02:01:30]  The parents we had, that generation, didn't stop it.  So if they had been this fucking super generation and stopped that shit, we wouldn't be dealing with it now.  But they didn't stop it.  They didn't do anything about it, or they did not enough.  So now this is not just coming out of nowhere.  This is trying to stop something that had the ones that we're saying were so they knew what they were doing.  Had they fucking done it better, we wouldn't be in this situation. 
[02:02:00]  I'm not saying that people who are fucking absolute fuck-ups and do nothing should just be rewarded.  I'm not an idiot.  But I'm talking about people who are by no fault of their own.  It's like, look, some people are just, again, little fucking ugly, weird kids.  And it's like, believe me, the life is going to take care of the people who are qualified.  The fucking smarter kids are still going to be in the chess club.  The more athletic kids are still going to be the athletes.  None of that shit's going to change.  It does.  It all works out.  Those participation trophies, they're all... 
[02:02:30]  They don't mean anything.  They're disgusting.  But, you know, my dad, you know, God rest his soul, he ran a basketball league, and he understood how kids could go home rejected.  We had an awards dinner every year.  So he gave everybody something.  You know, and those kids went home like, look.  And you could tell, like, you know, the kids that really gave a shit about basketball, well, yeah, whatever, you know.  But to those kids, they were so excited they went home with something. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  But then he gave out real awards.  That's all I'm trying to say here.  That's what the teachers could do.  Make sure every kid has a stupid Valentine's Day card.  But then you allow some of that individuality.  You're right.  The kids that didn't get anything, they're going to go home with the card from the teacher excited.  Trust me.  They really well.  But that's how it still exists.  Even though the schools and the teachers are trying to level the playing field, if you talk to these kids, once your kid gets a little older, you'll see.  You talk to them.  They're still the cool kids.  They're still the geeks.  They're still the nerds. 
[02:03:30]  As they get older, the burnout, they have different words for them now, druggers, you know, whatever.  But it all still happens.  It's just they keep it quiet.  They don't talk about it as openly, and they pretend like they're doing something.  They're trying.  I mean, what are they supposed to do, not try?  I guess they have to try to do something.  I think what's going on, though, there's a minority of parents that don't want their kids to have their feelings hurt, so then everyone else has to kind of buckle.  And like Jimmy said, yeah, maybe it's time for the majority of the parents, because that's truly what I do see so far, really should speak up. 
[02:04:00]  Me and my wife absolutely have spoken up about it, but you get shut down immediately.  Like, oh, it's just the way.  It's in the handbook.  This is how they've been doing it for a while.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  You know, but at least we try, and maybe others should try as well.  And I think certainly some of the parents in my kids' classroom, that they're trying as well.  You need to march down there and pull that kid out of that wussy school.  Oh.  I don't think you're wrong.  I'm starting to wonder, you know.  Thank you, brother.  I'll tell you.  It works out.  It works out.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dan in Jersey.  Dan. 
[02:04:30]  Dan?  Hello?  Dan the man?  Sorry about that.  Good morning, guys.  What do you got, brother, before we take a break?  All right.  You know what?  I agree with both points, but to be honest, Jimmy, you're a little wrong here just because  do you think that, like, if Mark Zuckerberg got fucking Valentine's Day cards or laid in  middle school that he wouldn't create a social networking site to outreach, like, for every  person?  No, I don't. 
[02:05:00]  I would bet Zuckerberg did not get a Valentine's Day card.  Probably not, no.  But then again, if Hitler was a good painter, there'd be a lot more people.  I mean, I know what you mean.  I like Hitler's work.  You don't need to pick the absolute streams.  I mean, the painting.  Yeah.  But I know what you're saying.  I mean, like, for every kid that doesn't, you know, get the recognition or whatever,  sure, they could throw up to do bad things.  But for every one of those, there's also a dozen that become, like, Apple CEOs or nerds  or, you know, artists or musicians.  But I think they will anyway.  Like, if that negated it, like, if giving cards to everyone created sameness in such the sense 
[02:05:30]  that you wouldn't have the Mark Zuckerbergs or, you know, the Slashes playing guitar or  all, I would agree with you.  But I don't think that these little things, I think that they're just helping some people  who would feel horrible feel a little bit better.  I don't think they're going to negate greatness.  They're not going to stop geniuses from being geniuses or science geniuses from being, or  funny people from being funny.  I don't think it's going to be nearly that extreme in effect.  I think it's just helping little shittier feelings kind of not be there all the time. 
[02:06:00]  I think you're going to look at your own experiences and what we talk about on the show a lot and  realize that those experiences do make a big difference.  I think you're kind of downplaying that those experiences and what they contribute to who  you are now and, you know, the good and the bad and where you are right now in your career  and whatnot.  I think it did have a big impact.  Where I am right now is absolutely luck. 
[02:06:30]  I mean, I worked hard, but had I had a gun at that age,  I would have shot myself.  It's not a question.  Do you understand?  We get in a time machine.  Where's my DeLorean?  If I had a gun at that age, I, without any question, would have committed suicide.  Wow.  It's not even a maybe or a, I think I, I know exactly.  I would have done it in a moment.  Okay, listen.  It's all those things that leading up, like you have those life experiences that molded you  into a great comic.  If you were coddled at that age, you never would have been able to flourish and have these 
[02:07:00]  different things in court that make you good.  I know what you're saying, but I don't think it's that extreme where the coddling is so  much that personalities aren't going to become personalities.  But I, I do know what you mean.  I just don't necessarily agree.  All right.  I got it.  I got it.  I got to go.  There's a couple of really good calls.  There's a bullying expert wants in.  Expert?  What?  He just believes people?  Yes.  He must have been here.  You got to.  He's our agent.  He's constantly the victim of it.  Very good. 
[02:07:30]  Joe in Yonkers.  His wife's a principal.  What do you got, Joe?  What movie?  Huh?  You guys, this is the show.  You don't know how many nights I want to grab the fucking phone from my wife.  So, why?  She's talking to the janitor and the dildo?  I'll get, she'll get the phone call.  My son was bullied on the bus.  What are you going to do about it?  They'd be in our office at 8.30 in the morning.  Standing over.  What are you going to do about my son getting bullied?  I remember when I was younger. 
[02:08:00]  And you tell me.  If somebody fucked with you on the bus, did you not go to the kid's house?  Or your father or your brother go to that fucking house?  Yeah, something was done.  Oh, yeah.  The bus was no man's land, too.  The bus had nothing to do with school.  Wow.  It really was.  God, that's a great way to look at it.  That was, you know, you needed safe passage to school.  School was relatively safe.  And then home, of course, very safe.  And that bus.  That bus, right?  Anything went.  Anything goes.  The fucking bus driver was on crystal meth, so he didn't give a fuck what we did, right? 
[02:08:30]  My kid's getting nasty texts.  What are you going to do about it?  Go fuck yourself.  Pick up a phone and call the fucking parents yourself.  There are so many avenues to, like, pick on people now, too.  Yeah.  The problem, too, is all these fucking soft cunts, when we were growing up, made their money,  fucking, you know, internet money, all this other bullshit.  So now they got a voice.  They pay a lot of money in taxes, so they think they can fucking delegate whatever they want. 
[02:09:00]  And their little fucking cunt kid can't fucking protect himself.  They go run to fucking mommy and daddy.  Well, yeah, but, dude, were you a big kid when you were growing up?  You know the funny thing?  I was a big kid, and all these other little kids used to fuck around me.  But I'd throw a kid down to fucking fly the stairs.  That was the last time he fucked with me.  Well, yeah, you could do that, though.  I know, dude, if I could throw someone down the steps, my life, you know, Colin Quinn has  a really brilliant joke about, uh, about Gandhi was all about peace, but then again,  because he was 130 pounds soaking wet. 
[02:09:30]  And I think, and I don't want to ruin Colin's joke, but he goes, I know some guys who think  a left hook can cure cancer, which is really such a brilliant observation.  Goddamn, Colin.  But it's like, if you're able to do that, it's different.  But, like, there are kids that, like, yeah, they got glasses, and they can't defend themselves  like that.  And it's like, what are they supposed to do on the bus?  Just go there and get their fucking asses kicked every day?  It's not right.  Although, if you teach them right, right?  Like, I tell my kid, it's funny, because my wife's the principal, so I tell my son, 
[02:10:00]  when anybody ever fucks with you, you jack them in the nose, and they'll never fuck  with you again.  And my wife's looking at me like, what, are you crazy?  But I'm like, what are you going to, because I've got to be honest, too, when I was young,  there was two kids left back, they were, like, two years older than us, they used to fuck  with me.  The left back bruisers.  That was the kid, the fucking kid.  They got beards.  The kid that fucked, yeah, two Albanian kids that were left back, they were, like, 15 in  eighth grade.  I finally threw the kid down a fucking flaty stairs the last time he fucked with me.  This guy loves throwing people down the stairs. 
[02:10:30]  But let's say you couldn't do that.  Let's say you're a really small guy, and you couldn't do that.  Then what would you have done?  I still would have fucking jacked the kid up, because you know how many years I went?  At least two years with these two fucking idiots in my class, and I was like, I know  it's not the right thing to fucking hit this kid, but I can't take it anymore.  Right.  And I don't want a kid to grow up feeling like they got fucked.  It's like you're getting raped almost.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I don't want to say that to you.  You know, when you feel like you can't defend yourself, it's a fucked up feeling.  I agree with you. 
[02:11:00]  The one thing, if I could go back in time, I would have, like, learned how to defend myself  better.  Yeah.  I would have taken up, like, karate or some kind of fucking MMA type of shit.  If you'd be with Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a lot of that bully will stop, or these fucking  kids will rip your arm off.  Something, though.  Just so I had that tool if I needed it or had to.  Not that I would, you know, walk around beating the shit out of people.  But I wouldn't have felt as vulnerable.  I was definitely a small kid that got picked on.  But think about it, then.  Even if you would have one time fucking punched somebody once, maybe even punched the fucking 
[02:11:30]  guy first.  I don't know.  Then you'd just get your ass beat the next day when he comes in.  That shit never works.  Nah.  And sometimes it will stop a bully.  And, you know, this guy's not wrong.  Protecting yourself is really a smart way to do it.  But again, how does that train you for the real world?  Like, you go to a job, and there's some asshole in the sales office that you work with who's  kind of alpha-mailing you.  What are you going to do?  Get up and smash him in the teeth at a laptop?  You got to fucking...  That kind of used to happen before human resources. 
[02:12:00]  People got some shit done at work.  Smash him in the fuck.  But who wants to work in a place where guys are getting punched in the face in the office?  That'd be great.  Who wants to work there?  Well, as long as we can hang up our calendars still.  Yeah, there's other inter-office politics and ways you can, you know, alpha-mail the alpha-mail.  All right, listen, I got to go, bro, just because there's...  Oh, bro.  Because we got a bunch of guys and ladies that went in really fast here.  We got Ray in Oklahoma.  Go ahead, Ray.  Oh, you dozen hestic.  Oh, I tell you, you said it perfect. 
[02:12:30]  I got a boy, he's 12.  He's always been a big kid.  And from the time he was, like, five, I put him in a wrestling program.  And not only does it teach them how to take care of themselves, but it also teaches them self-discipline to where they know they don't have to go around beating the shit out of people.  I think it also gives you a bit of confidence that people can kind of smell when you're growing up.  You know what I mean?  And you have more of a confidence about you where maybe, you know, bullies are going to go, oh, all right, I ain't fucking without that guy. 
[02:13:00]  Who knows?  We got some little guys that are, like, fucking 12 years old.  They're fucking 80 pounds.  And you don't fuck with them.  And, you know, they don't go around causing trouble.  But I guarantee you, if you mess with those kids, they'll fucking take you down, put you in a fucking scissor, and rip your groin apart.  And you don't fuck with them anymore.  That's just what it is.  This is old-school shit, man.  Can you imagine if your kid did this at school now? 
[02:13:30]  MMA, dude.  Right.  That's what it's all about.  You know, Rogan, everybody talks about, you know, how wrestling is the foundation.  And, of course, my kid plays football, baseball, all that shit, too.  But he doesn't have to pick on people, and nobody picks on him.  Another thing that's good about it is he doesn't tolerate somebody fucking picking on, like, one of his friends that might not be able to take care of themselves.  He'll step in.  Yeah, there you go.  I was just listening to Joe Rogan's podcast at the gym yesterday, and he was talking about the MMA fighters and their background. 
[02:14:00]  And he says the majority of MMA fighters had horrible upbringings.  And that's why they're MMA fighters.  When we've talked to him, it's like, oh, he said that?  No, I'm just saying, like, when we've spoken to a few of those guys, when they delve back into their youth, it's like, oh, okay.  There's always some twisted fucking thing.  They just had a horrible upbringing with, you know, mostly their home life.  The brothers fighting them, right?  Or he did say in the podcast as well that a lot of these guys were bullied and picked on at school. 
[02:14:30]  And this is how it turned around in their lives.  They became fucking MMA monsters.  Yeah.  Well, I got one thing for Jimmy.  Yes.  And, Jimmy, I love you to death, but I got to tell you, man, children are a reflection of their parents.  I'm sorry?  Children act the way that they are allowed to act.  Yeah.  I think you're probably right.  So, you know.  So that, but kind of going with that point, that's, I kind of am glad you said that because when you're dealing with, you know, 17-year-old, when you're dealing with kindergarten fucking children, they don't, like, we're all talking about this as adults who can compare and weigh hindsight and experience. 
[02:15:00]  Like, when you're a kid and you just feel like a piece of shit, you don't have the wherewithal or the mental ability to go, hey, you know what, it's not my fault my parents suck and this kid's got bad parents.  That's why he's bullying me.  You don't have the, we can form this stuff as adults, but as a kid, you just know you're getting beat up and you feel like a piece of shit. 
[02:15:30]  But I think that's where the teachers are very important.  Right.  So what are they supposed to do?  They could sit down, sit down the children and, you know, give them a good talking to and try to explain things to them, I guess.  I don't know, parenting is a motherfucker, dude.  Yeah.  It is a motherfucker.  It is a full-time job for real.  And a lot of parents are shitty at it and are lazy with it, unfortunately.  Yeah.  And that's what you have to deal with with your own kid, that you have to now, you know, put them in an environment where there's kids that aren't being, you know, raised properly. 
[02:16:00]  It sucks.  Yeah.  And I don't even know what the real answer is.  I just know parents should fucking work harder at parenting, but.  Like all this stuff about, like, hey, all these kids are getting stuff they don't deserve and Valentine's, like, that's just, again, that's been happening forever.  It's almost like, you know, any parents with influence have been getting what they want for their kids for so many years.  And it's like, how does that train you for the workforce?  When we came up, are you going to tell me there weren't fucking parents who were much better connected or had much more to do that kids got into better, you know, had better opportunities, got into, come on. 
[02:16:30]  It's always been that way.  It's always been that way.  But it happened to us.  We didn't get Valentine's Day cards.  Most of us in the room.  I was all right with it.  I remember being sad, but I wasn't, like, devastated by it.  Yeah.  I just wasn't.  I moved on to something else.  You're kind of like, oh, fuck, I would have liked to have got one.  But then when you did get one, because it did happen eventually, it made it that much more special.  You're like, oh, fuck, this is awesome.  My fucker.  Right.  We're going to get married. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Married.  Plenty of heartbreak.  Thanks, sir.  Don't worry.  Let's go to Ron in Jersey.  Ron.  Hey.  Hi, Ron.  You're a bullying expert.  You want in on this.  I like to comment about the bullying expert.  I'm actually an expert on bullying and being a victim of bullying.  I do workshops, and I actually had to stop doing workshops for teachers in schools because  teachers can't do anything anymore.  Ever since zero tolerance, like you said, Anthony, before, happened about 20 years ago,  which is all about just guns, and it's all about weapons. 
[02:17:30]  Now schools just don't want to be responsible for anything.  That's the biggest thing.  I mean, a kid, a first grader, got suspended for kissing a girl on the hand about a month  ago, and they called it sexual harassment.  She was scratching her crotch at the time.  Yes, and by a substitute teacher.  You hear that shit, though?  Sexual harassment, they called it.  But that's for the big...  For a first grader.  Yep.  Yeah, a first grader.  That's insane.  They've got to take back the schools.  Yeah, that's fucking crazy. 
[02:18:00]  The teachers and the principals and the administrators, they've got to take back their schools.  Well, they're afraid because what happens is everything is like, oh, we stopped bullying.  Christy has these anti-bullying bills, this and that.  A parent of a bully, who's probably a bully, walks in and goes, I'm going to sue you, and  the supervisors always go, ah, you know what, forget about it, your kid's not a bully, you're  fine.  No, most people who sue are probably not bullies, sir.  They're fucking...  And again, this is a lot of it comes from the people who don't know how to raise their  kids, right?  Or they're just too late.  Maybe their kids were bullied. 
[02:18:30]  But it's all parents suing.  Right.  It really is all parents suing.  So parents have brought this on themselves.  People like me don't...  And Anthony, we don't give a fuck.  We don't have no kids.  Right.  We don't even hear about this shit.  Right.  It's parents suing the school system.  Right.  So people who are complaining about this, your fellow members of the public are the ones  who did it.  The school didn't just do this for no reason.  It was because they're tired of getting sued.  Yeah, school's just becoming a shitty place.  It always was, I guess, but...  The day that a school actually stands up to a parent of a bully and says, you know what? 
[02:19:00]  After you try to sue us, because our attorneys are going to be better than yours, and they  actually take a stand, then all the other schools are going to go, oh, wow, we can actually  stand up to a bully?  Because it doesn't make sense.  It's not going to trickle down.  Teachers have no power anymore.  They kick a kid out, and then all of a sudden the principal says, oh, I'm too busy.  Here's a kid back in your classroom.  Deal with it.  And that's why it doesn't work.  You're right.  However, what you're forgetting is you're forgetting a very important part.  The school has to pay their attorneys to defend against the lawsuit. 
[02:19:30]  I know that's the most common thing.  Fuck it.  They'll sue.  They ain't going to win.  What do you think?  The attorneys do that for free?  You think they write you a letter?  Hey, you were right.  We won.  This one's on the house.  They send you bills for thousands of dollars.  That's why I don't know what the answer is, because Jimmy's absolutely right.  That's a major expense for a school district.  Yeah, sure.  And parents can just sue, and how many parents are lawyers?  Right.  They can just file motion, and it's like the school's supposed to just defend against thousands  of parents over the years?  Come on, man.  It doesn't make...  It's...  Wow. 
[02:20:00]  This is...  It sounds like a no-win situation.  There sure is no clean-cut answer.  Oh, my God, no.  But, I mean, that's a big part of it.  Thank you, sir.  I'm going to go on one more call, and then we've got to move on to some other shit.  Chris in West Palm Beach.  What's up?  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  All right, brother.  All right.  Oh, I don't have to deal with the holiday thing, because my boys go to Catholic school.  But down here, they have a new thing with education.  It's called Common Core.  So my boys...  All right.  You've heard of this, man? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They were doing a story on it last night.  Some parents are pretty pissed.  Okay.  My boys are 8 and 11.  So my 8-year-old is in second grade.  So if one kid could spell the word cat, the next kid could spell the word school, and the  third kid could spell Mississippi.  Put it all together.  And they're all challenged.  It's fine.  So my kid might have to spell Mississippi, and the other kid writes cat and dog, and they  both get 100.  Again, see?  It's this collective... 
[02:21:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm confused.  This collective experience.  I'm confused.  All right.  But it's about personally challenging each child.  So if there's...  My second grader is 8, and there's 19 kids in his class.  One kid could spell the word cat and be challenged by it.  One kid could spell, we'll say a bigger word, school, and be challenged by it.  And then you got one kid that can spell Mississippi. 
[02:21:30]  Okay, I got it.  So what's...  As long as you spell cat, you...  You get a passing grade, I guess?  You get 100, just like the kid.  But if a kid that spells Mississippi, if that word's challenging him, he gets 102.  The whole class doesn't have to spell Mississippi or the word school.  They, you know, they could just spell cat.  But what's the test?  What's the question?  Spell Mississippi?  M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.  Very good, Jimmy.  We love you. 
[02:22:00]  He's just using like an example.  And you're very good at explaining things.  He's just using that as an example.  Right.  It's pretty much as long as the entire collective of students.  Right.  It's almost as if you ask the entire class to take one test.  You have the ditto with all the questions.  And all the kids gather around and go, oh, I know this one.  Okay.  Oh, I know this one.  Oh, how about you?  Oh, I could answer question three.  Okay.  And now you get the test.  It's 100.  Right.  They all get 100. 
[02:22:30]  Even though one kid obviously can only spell Kappa, can't spell Mississippi.  But thank God some other kid in the class could do it.  So it's, again, this collective experience of, hey, the class knew this.  But you know what that's about?  That's probably about keeping GPA up.  Oh, hell yeah.  Because if the grades aren't kept up, then all of a sudden the school doesn't get funding  and they don't get their new computer.  That's probably pressure just coming down from the school board on the principals  and on the individual teachers.  They can't come up with this idea of how to get their GPA up. 
[02:23:00]  Because you can't come back and go, he's a dumb motherfucker.  Yeah, what am I going to do?  The schools always get blamed when kids don't graduate.  Yeah.  So it's like parents aren't going to blame themselves.  Right.  I'm 44.  I was born and raised in St. Louis.  Congratulations.  Great.  Good for you.  Yeah, I'm 45.  So do it for one more year and then call me.  That's a very good job.  Combative guy.  But, I mean, it's not like, you know, you had the kid who was in special ed  or the kid who needed tutoring after school.  No, now it's just whoever could do whatever, we're all happy with you. 
[02:23:30]  Whoever could do whatever.  Right.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  All that stuff is how necessary is it to, even those little things you're learning.  Yeah.  Once again, like Ray Kurzweil said, when Google becomes intuitive,  you're just going to know shit anyway.  Like, you don't even have to know stuff anymore.  Like, because you're allowed to use calculators for math.  You could just go, who's the president of Albania?  Doot doot.  It comes back.  But it doesn't even seem like they're adjusting their teaching.  Teachings, I should say. 
[02:24:00]  Now that we do have this tool that's called Google,  half the shit you don't even need to learn in school.  You're just going to learn it over time anyway by looking stuff up.  So why would you have to memorize that shit?  Seriously.  Well, what if you want to get a job over there in deepest, darkest Africa  where they don't have all this technology?  But if there's a question they're asking you on a test,  and we all have phones, and, well, here's the answer.  Yeah.  Then what are you teaching them?  I don't know.  I guess you're teaching them how to figure out things for themselves. 
[02:24:30]  Trying to give their brain a workout.  How to put two and two together yourself.  Teach them how to use Google properly.  That's a lot easier.  You're also just trusting somebody else's information  instead of gathering up evidence and figuring it out in your own head.  Those long, drawn-out history classes.  Yeah.  That's all a waste of time for people our age because it's all right there for us.  Well, it's also those prepackaged curriculums, too.  When you had an interesting teacher that was kind of, you know, fun,  could spin a yarn, tell a little story. 
[02:25:00]  God, how rare are those teachers?  Now they just get these fucking curriculums mailed to them and hand them out.  As soon as you said that, I guarantee most people out there just,  teachers' names popped into their head.  Yeah, yeah.  And only a couple, maybe two or three in their entire schooling.  Yeah.  For me, it was Mr. Fincher.  There you go.  Oh.  He was off book.  Off book.  That's what they got to do.  He really was.  He was like the cool teacher.  We all have that one cool teacher.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  He was the one who's like, yeah, it's fucking warm outside.  Let's just do class under a stupid apple tree.  Yeah, let's do that.  Man.  Let's see the hippie teacher.  Yeah, but then you had...  Okay, Opie, we're going to go outside today.  But then you had the uptight teachers that couldn't even, you know,  think outside the box in that way whatsoever.  Oh, it was all by the book.  By the fucking book.  Yes.  I just think of these kids, man, that I went to school with that got bullied.  And because their family was very poor and they lived on the street.  They had a tiny, shitty fucking house and they were always the dirty kid. 
[02:26:00]  But again, they were young.  So that's how you're fucking raised.  Your mother's a slob.  That's what you go through.  And they were just treated like shit.  And I mean by the...  Because we sensed that they were different and everyone would fucking torture them  and fucking, you know, they were just treated hard.  And one of the kids, like the younger brother, wound up taking an aerosol can  and lighting a match and fucking setting somebody on fire with him.  Like you get pushed so...  And I'm not saying you're going to avoid all that shit.  But if they had just been treated a little bit better, 
[02:26:30]  like maybe not pushed to that fucking extreme because they had shit beyond their control,  maybe that wouldn't have happened.  Like they didn't, you know, we can't say,  well, why didn't they just adjust their self-esteem?  They were too young to know how to do that.  I think it's two different subjects though.  I'm not for kids being bullied in school, trust me.  But the Valentine's Day thing, you know, I think it's two very different issues.  Yeah.  I don't think any kid should have to go to school and be bullied.  No, no.  That's for sure.  But you know what I mean?  Like when you mention bullying, like some guy would go,  hey, tell him to kick his ass. 
[02:27:00]  But it's easy if you're big.  Can't do that.  Yeah.  But they're full of shit.  You see all these bullying programs, like we're stopping bullying and stuff.  Yeah.  It's way worse.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so much easier to bully someone because of this online thing.  We didn't have that.  You had to be right in front of the person to bully them.  Now you just fucking find their, you know, whatever the fuck the kids are up to.  All their information's out there.  Which one are they on now?  You gather it up.  They're moving around quickly.  Yeah.  Snapchat is it now?  Is it still Instagram for the kids?  Where are they at?  Where are they at? 
[02:27:30]  No.  We just could quickly fucking beat the shit out of them online.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You gather up information and then you just use it against them.  That's some good technology bullying.  Let's get funny after the break.  Oh, what?  Let's try to get funny.  Did you see that video?  Which one?  The one that you sent out?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We'll play that after the break.  Waiting for a mate.  Bill Burr is all about this as well.  Someone just tweeted this to me.

[02:47:00]  like he was  and then like he was  going to walk off the  stage and then  Mr. Bojangles  yeah  you got to turn around  the first time I ever  saw Jeff Zabrowski  I was brand new  in comedy  and Florentine  was the host  I used to just  go to shows  and Jeff was the  headliner  and I forget who  the middle was  but Jim's on stage  hosting  and Jeff just  walks up in his  suit  and interrupts Jim  and he's like  can I come on  and Jim's like  what  no it's not  your turn yet  and he just  was ashamed  that he walked  away  and he just  kept coming up  at different points  going like  can I come on  now  and he goes  no 
[02:47:30]  it's not  in hindsight  I realized  how ballsy  that was  as a headliner  to let yourself  be seen like that  there's no surprise  it was a place  called the Varsity Pub  which is where I wound  up doing my first  show ever  and that was  the first place  I saw Quentin Higgs  I saw Otto  and George  before I ever  performed  me and my buddy  Tyler would go  and watch  these stand-ups  I never interrupted  we would sit  in the front  and Florentine  picked on me  what are you guys  gay  and he was in it  for six months  or less  and I never 
[02:48:00]  heckled  I wasn't that  type of wannabe  I just wanted  to be a part  of it  we're like  no we're just  friends  I would always  play along  that's wild  to hear  did Dabrowski  die?  I hope not  I haven't seen  him in so many  years  I know  I haven't even  heard his name  like in fucking  20 years  I never heard  of him before  Jeff Dabrowski  yeah he was a  funny guy  if you saw his  face you probably  know  weird looking  little guy  with a mustache  yeah yeah  big mustache  he may have  moved  I certainly hope  he's not dead  yeah  he was a good guy  a guy named  Vince D'Antoni

[02:49:00]  ballsiest things you could do  yeah  to go in those tunnels  and then  to fucking  see what the hell  was going on down there  fuck that  let's do the  Lawrence Fishburne  what sucks about  you know  doing radio nowadays  by the time we get this  everyone has seen it though  last night  this one  kind of  yesterday afternoon  kind of broke  Lawrence Fishburne  is he going to be in  RoboCop  I guess he's in RoboCop  or Samuel Jackson  Samuel Jackson  you were doing  the same thing  that the newscaster did 
[02:49:30]  whoa  but  oh my god  I think I just did  yeah  but I'm saying  the Lawrence  whatever  whatever  I'm going to try  to explain it  of course  no motherfucker  Samuel Jackson  is on this TV show  out there  in Hollywood  yeah  doing one of these  we've seen that  douche before  many times  and  okay  well we'll just  play it  Jesus  I can't believe  we just did that  TMZ 
[02:50:00]  I tell you what  you working for Marvel  the Super Bowl commercial  did you get a lot of  reaction to that  Super Bowl commercial  what Super Bowl commercial  oh  you know what  I didn't know  my mistake  you know  you're as crazy  as the people on Twitter  I'm not  Lawrence Fishburne  that's my fault  I know that  that was my fault  my mistake  you know what  we don't all look alike  we don't all look alike  we're all black and famous  but we all don't look alike  I am guilty 
[02:50:30]  next question  I am guilty  he thought you were Bob Dylan  right  you're the entertainment reporter  I know  I'm talking to you  the entertainment reporter  for this station  and you don't know the difference  between me and Lawrence Fishburne  my mistake  my mistake  I apologize  really my big mistake  let's talk about  relax  a very short line  for your job  I'll say  it probably would not be hard  to get another person  to sit right here  let's talk about RoboCop  oh hell no  let's talk about RoboCop  will you look at this  fucking cocksucker 
[02:51:00]  he's trying to change  the subject real quick  let's talk about RoboCop  right right  just stay in the moment  jerk  while you're fucked up  yeah enjoy it  oh my god  he's killing  Samuel Jackson  is killing you  right yeah  you're getting something special  instead of the same  old bullshit interview  let's talk about RoboCop  god I fucking hate these guys  right at this point  fuck RoboCop  fuck your questions  and just  go with it  spend the next two or three minutes  being in this moment  Jimmy's absolutely right  let's get back on track  back on track  I don't know how to handle this 
[02:51:30]  if it's off track  I'd be  yeah he should jump in  and say like you know  like RoboCop  is that going to be like  your character in Blade  right right  just keep going  play with it  sure  you're right  keep going  yes  let's talk about RoboCop  oh hell no  oh hell no  really  oh man  I apologize  I'm the other guy  I'm the other guy  the other one  what's in your wallet  right  that's it  that's exactly right 
[02:52:00]  there's more than one black guy  doing a commercial  there it is  no question about that  oh listen to her  I'll say this  he's groveling  he is  but Samuel Jackson  is fucking with him  like  instead of just realizing  the guy made a mistake  which I almost did  with fucking Hugh Jackman  when he was in here  mixing him up with  Neil Patrick Harris  but it got covered quickly  how the hell  do you mix up Wolverine  with Doogie Howser  it's just a mistake  you make sometimes  Jesus  but Samuel's making it look like  oh it's just because I'm a black  it's like  it's not always that dude  sometimes people just  fuck up with celebrities 
[02:52:30]  but you know what  now he's just having fun  because Samuel Jackson  has done a million  of these interviews  he's probably bored  doing them  so to him  it was probably  oh okay cool  I can have fun for once  at least he didn't  mistake a dead child  for the guy  a dead son  you wouldn't have stayed  in that moment  oh my god  yeah or one rapper  for another  right right  he didn't mistake a rapper  for another one  call him  Ice Q  Ice Q  Adam  Ice Q  Ice Q  so confident too 
[02:53:00]  those are two  Ice Q  those are just  two great moments  on this show man  I love it  you're not at the center  of them  oh yes  Adam Walsh  I wish I was here  for the last thing  I love shit like that  you talk about  not wanting to stay  in a moment  wow  I would stay in that moment  yeah you want to move on  to RoboCop real quick  RoboCop  RoboCop  whatever  I don't care  I absolutely would have  stayed in that moment 
[02:53:30]  if I was here  Trav  is this him  no I don't know  yes there he is  okay  he's coming in  I can hear his voice  Adam Walsh  hi John  how are you  where did I stay  hi John  how are you  Jimmy didn't want to  stay in the moment  John  how are you  John  John  not Adam  the dead kid  you had no desire  to stay in that moment  no  I'm big on staying  in the moment  however  wow  when the blithering  idiot across from me 
[02:54:00]  refers to a man  as his murdered son  which has been  his driving force  in life  I feel it better  to move forward  quickly  yes of course  you do  when I said  what did I say  I knew what I had said  oh no  of course you must have been  you should have been  what did I say  did you want me to  reiterate it  you mentioned  the child  who was brutally  murdered by honest tool  instead of the man  who's with us  that's what you've  he was beheaded  yes  let's say  baseball cap  that's such a disturbing  let's say 
[02:54:30]  hi to Gary in D.C.  Gary  best way not forget  Ice Cube  Ice Cube  I did your phone  crapped out  nice try Jimmy  he's gone  he hung right up  what happened  they can't hear the show  anymore on hold  or something  no they can hear it  that's weird  back to Samuel L. Jackson  there it is  no question about that  I'm the what's in your wallet  black guy  he's the car black guy  there it is  Morgan Freeman 
[02:55:00]  is the other credit card guy  you only hear his voice though  so you probably won't  confuse him with  you're exactly  you're out  you're 100% right  this guy doesn't want to  fight back  because he knows  he might say something racist  he tried to go to RoboCop again  but he's also the black guy  that turns off  the house  the water  and the lights  when his kid tells him  the house is cool  I'm not that guy either  do we want to do a list  of all the people  that you're not  that's what he's doing  holy shit 
[02:55:30]  you're right  I know that's surprising  fair enough  he's petrified  and I'm the only black guy  in RoboCop  that's not a criminal  other than Michael K. White  see Samuel  right  let's see here's the thing  Samuel L. Jackson  is not fucking around  he's really angry  yeah because he's  he's had to deal with that  from time to time  like that's  like when I said  the guy was trying  he was being a bit  like he's a black guy  like he was having fun with it  but Samuel L. Jackson  really wasn't having fun with it 
[02:56:00]  like he was genuinely  good for Samuel L. Jackson  pissed off  good  that fucking  dumb Hollywood reporter  didn't even want to fight back  you're going to list  he goes  you're going to list  all the people you're not  not like all the black people  you're not  he didn't even say black  he didn't want to say black  he didn't want to  like Kentucky Fried Chicken  I didn't do one of those either  no  I better not say anything about that  but again if this guy says  one thing wrong  he's fired  exactly  one  if this guy tries joking back  and it's mildly misconstrued  his cunt bosses will fire him 
[02:56:30]  he stinks  but he's also in a fucking  no one position  you're right  yeah  that's good  I just  that was great  I like Samuel L. Jackson  he's fucking hilarious  I have no problem with that clip at all  I like his tweet  when he was tweeting  I haven't seen his tweets  in a long time  he's still  out there in the Twitterverse  he fucking  closed his foot  because of people  misinterpreting  oh Jimmy  oh boy  you know what it was 
[02:57:00]  it wasn't even the laugh  it was  no you were so serious  at first  oh you  you furrowed your brow  sometimes I give it away  after  yeah  by the end of the sentence  he looks like a cheeky boy  then he's just  grinning  he should have one finger  over his mouth  going  tee hee  I do my dimples  whenever my dimples show  you know I'm just being cheeky  if you were telling the truth  would he look so cheeky  I doubt it  why don't we move on  to that other clip 
[02:57:30]  that was sent to us  this morning  maybe it's something  that most people haven't seen  Bill Burr is all about this too  Rodney Dangerfield  what's the description  it's called  waiting for a mate  the description is  must see  alright  oh boy  let's fucking do it then  then we must  looks like we've got a cop  that's about to pull somebody over  cop you idiot  Senior Constable Ash Bowden  is on to an unusual job  just up in Caram Downs  we're looking for a car  that was doing burnouts  and then another call  has come through 
[02:58:00]  I know  saying that  a similar looking car  or a very similar description  has crashed  is this Corey  we're just trying to get to it  as quick as we can  to see what the hell's going on  witnesses to the incident  have given the location  as this shopping mall car park  car park  Ash soon spots  what he's looking  from the petrol station  oh look at the car  it's all fucked up  what happened mate  what's going on  I'm just waiting for a mate  is that why your car's  all smashed up  and you're up on the grass  at the moment  or what  yeah  he's waiting for a mate

[03:01:00]  oh  out of the car now  or get your license out  make a decision  righty at his crick  did the cool  what the  it's so funny  watching a drunk guy  his eyes move  as he searches for excuses  what do you do  if you're a cop  this is what cops  have to deal with  all the time  these fucking assholes  well here's what you do  in the United States  you grab him by the throat  pull him out the fucking window  because he said  the guy said  give me your license  and get out 
[03:01:30]  he goes no  he was willing  to give me your license  he still gave him the option  yeah yeah  that just doesn't happen  the politeness  is what makes this clip  so great  let me tell you  what the good old  US of A has  the taser  they have to have that  they don't they  instant compliance  yeah I'm sure they do  but they probably  don't use it  they probably don't use it  as much  with the gusto  that we like using them here  I don't have a license  I'm sitting here  here  because  I'm waiting for a mate  a mate  and  I don't understand 
[03:02:00]  why there's six people  standing around me  because we're working mate  and you've had a car crash  no I haven't  you're drunk  am I  yeah you are mate  am I  I smell it all over you  so hop out of the car  I'm not  no  easy  come on  oh shit  if you don't want to tell me  who you are  or produce a license mate  you can come over this way  to the police car  the motorist continues  to deny any association  with alcohol  but the evidence  is everywhere  wild turkey in the back  come over this way mate  come over this way 
[03:02:30]  like I said  to the police car  I have nothing on me  as I said before  come up this way  when you stand  in the pockets  car put no  no  no you're right  stand there mate  I'm not being argumentative  with you  I'm not being argumentative  with you  I'm just asking you  to do a few things  I have nothing on me  who owns the car  I don't know  what's your name  let's start with that  James  what's your last name  James  but Ash knows  he's now being lied to  because the driver  has already told him  James is the name 
[03:03:00]  of his alleged friend  well there could be  two Jameses  yeah exactly  it's not like he said  fucking what's your name  fucking  he knows he's being  lied to  because she was  the mistress of Hitler  and she's dead  he gets drunken  anytime anybody  asks him  anybody's name  James  James  Lord of the Wasteland  humongous  very good  this guy's great 
[03:03:30]  what's your last name  James  a suspected drunk driver  has been lying  to senior constable  Ash Bowden  but finally  comes clean  what's your last name  my name's  look at your car mate  you've had an accident  it's blatantly obvious  I've pulled it back  because there was  like  20 people around there  before  so you drove the car  backwards did you  focus on me Clint  you're under arrest mate 
[03:04:00]  turn around  what for  because I'm not happy  with who you are  put your hands behind your back  and sit down here  in the back of the police car  where you can have a think  I told you who I was  have a think  have a think  that's great  do you hold a Victorian driver's licence  no I don't  I was it  probably  12 months ago  for what  drink driving  drink driving  you shouldn't be  you shouldn't be driving  at the moment  I'll be over in the other seat  very shortly  shouldn't you be  the driver  the driver continues to protest  his innocence 
[03:04:30]  once he's settled down  Ash removes the handcuffs  and conducts a breath test  wow  I'll do this for you  just con  that'd be great  took the handcuffs  one  yep  is this in metric  and the cop knows  that he's got a great  like he knows  there's a TV camera  oh yeah  oh yeah  he's got a fucking star here  he even just got a little like  he goes  I'll do this for you  and he goes  oh that'd be great  that'd be great  right  right  right then  right  right  I know  wow he took the cuffs off  that would never happen here 
[03:05:00]  when the guy's hands  were shoved into his pockets  yeah his hands were in his pockets  it'd be  get your hands out of your pockets  okay  I'll trust you  yeah  oh  uh oh  I would say he's at a  one  do you hear that one  two  yeah it's working  all right Clint  in my opinion 
[03:05:30]  to the fact that I can  obviously smell alcohol on you  yes  you've been driving the vehicle  and you've been  involved in the collision  I've not driven the vehicle  okay  I now request you  to accompany me  to a police station  for the purpose of a breath test  I've not driven the vehicle  listen  you've got to listen to me  okay  it's very important  alright  now request you  to accompany me  to a police station  for an evidential breath test  okay  well you must remain there  until you're given  a certificate of analysis  or up to three hours  whichever's quicker  I'll do that  yeah you're happy to do that  I have not driven the vehicle 
[03:06:00]  as we rolled up  a collision scene  with this vehicle  a fair few witnesses  were already watching him  we've spoken to those witnesses  and they've  reconfirmed  as of the fact  that it was him driving  and we are happy with that  now he's obviously  blown into the breath testing  instrument  and we're taking him back  for a further breath test  at the station  if only it was that simple  the young man  is still not finished  just look at  I want to know  where James is  yeah where's his mate  yeah  what happens is he  just waiting for his mate  I think he's lying  Sam  alright 
[03:06:30]  shall I just continue  the clip then  the young man  is still not finished  just look at me  and just concentrate on me  mate  I'm not sure that you're  a federal officer  of the law  I'm not a federal officer  I'm a victor  well I'll move on then  I'm a Victorian police officer  mate  no well that's not good  let's not go around  in circles  are you not a federal officer  of the law  I know  let's not go around  in circles  are you a federal officer  of the law  do you want to come back  are you  no  Clinton  Clinton 
[03:07:00]  shut up and listen to me  it's quite serious  no  it's not cuffed  now  I've answered your question  do you want to come back  to the police station  not really no  because Ash knows  who the driver is  he's no longer under arrest  and may refuse  to go back to the station  if you want to go  wait what  pause this  wait  what  what did they just say  because he knows  who he is  because the guy  now knows who he is  he can refuse  to go to the station  wait  back that up  and then what  they got some wacky 
[03:07:30]  fucking laws  that is some weird  fucking laws  because he's requesting  he goes  I'm requesting  that you join us  back at the police station  instead of just  taking him there  that would be an immediate  no thank you  how about every time  you say no  let's hear the rest  let's hear the rest  say no every time  what  say that  it's quite serious  no  now  I've answered your question  do you want to come back  to the police station  not really no  because Ash knows  who the driver is 
[03:08:00]  he's no longer under arrest  and may refuse  to go back to the station  if you want to go  by your own free will  that would be fantastic  well you're driving  whilst disqualified  mate  I haven't driven  anywhere  well that's something  we can work out  at court  I haven't  I haven't gone  anywhere  wait  I need you to make  a definitive decision  definitive  can you define that  definitive  make one simple decision 
[03:08:30]  mate  and be clear about it  and stick with it  no  it's about what you want to do  let's go  you're happy to go now  I'll go  you're not going to change your mind  if you want me to go there  for a breath test  I'll go  the driver's official breath test result  back at the station  comes as no surprise to Ash  he blew .181  which is four times  over the legal  what is the  what are we missing here  now that he knows  the driver's name  he doesn't have  well do you remember  when he cuffed him 
[03:09:00]  and he goes  what are you cuffing me for  I'm not satisfied  with who you are  he didn't know  your identity  like he didn't  he gets the identity  because he didn't  give him the ID  right he didn't give him his name  yeah  so now that he knows  who he is  is that not an arrestable  offense in that country  drunk driving  or maybe because he wasn't  technically driving the car  maybe he didn't see him  driving the car  so he couldn't arrest him  what the fuck  but he said now that he knows  the driver's name  right and it seemed like  the field breath test  was not enough  maybe  so like if you come out 
[03:09:30]  of a bank  and you're like  my name's Philip Montgomery  alright you're free to go  I'm  I'll know your name  now we know your name  yeah  now that he knows his name  he could go I'm  no  I don't understand that at all  dude I don't either  but then he goes to the station  because I guess if you  don't go to the station  maybe it's worse down the road  maybe if you don't go  they put out a warrant  or something  they check your  because he gave him  a breathalyzer on sight  there  right  I don't know  take that back 
[03:10:00]  and  he was also disqualified  from driving  so he's going to receive  a summons for the drink  driving  driving whilst disqualified  where he'll have to go  and explain himself  to the magistrate  it just goes to show  that not only does alcohol  affect your ability  to drive  but it also affects  your ability  to tell the truth  the driver was fined  $600  in sentence  for four months  community service  nice  alright  that's like nothing  what the fuck  maybe it's not  an arrestable offense 
[03:10:30]  is there yet  his license  was disqualified  your license  was disqualified  for three years  I love how they  just put things  disqualified  disqualified  that doesn't sound  that bad  it's not revoked  or suspended  someone also  was telling me  that news anchor  with the  Samuel Jackson  that report's  apology  might make you  throw up  did he apologize  for that  he did apologize  come on  he said he was  sorry to Samuel  no  did he apologize 
[03:11:00]  I want to apologize  there's no apology  there  to the African  American community  I'm sorry  you all look  alike to me  oh there is  an apology  come on  is this  how embarrassing  yeah hang on  I gotta fast forward  anyway  from the bedroom  to the doghouse  we start right now  with the beauty  and the occasional  pain of live television  first and foremost  I do know  who Samuel L. Jackson  is I've interviewed  several times  over the years  but never quite  like the conversation  we just had  I indicated to Samuel 
[03:11:30]  that I had seen him  during the Super Bowl  and he thought  that I had confused him  with the commercial  Lawrence Fishburne  had done for a car company  of course a Captain America  ad had also run  during the Super Bowl  but I immediately felt  so dumb  I didn't bring that up  and he gave me  the shellacking  that was well deserved  ah  shut up  unlike a lot of people  who do this kind of work  more often than not  I really do know  what I'm talking about  but I didn't  30 minutes ago  and I'm really embarrassed  about it  and I very much  apologize to Samuel L. Jackson  and anyone else 
[03:12:00]  who was offended  for what was  anyone else  what is that  who else  would possibly be offended  how vomity country  how vomity  oh my god  there's more to it  oh my god  who else could have  possibly been  how humiliating  who would be offended  by that  white people  are petrified  of black people  they're petrified  of other white people  well  because they might have 
[03:12:30]  offended  again  I always stress this  because  Samuel L. Jackson  did what he did  he spoke it up  it's a fucking  white boss  that's gonna fire him  it's a fucking  white boss  yep  right  fucking  pussy white boss  enough  with this  groveling  it is embarrassing  that was embarrassing  as soon as you're saying  you know what  I was an idiot  because I saw the thing  right  and I didn't think  to say that  because I was embarrassed  but to apologize  yeah hey  sorry to Sam Jackson 
[03:13:00]  the first part  I didn't mind that much  he said  I fucked up  I'm embarrassed  he gave me a schlacking  that's all good  well deserved  but then he goes  into the  well deserved  well deserved  fucking god  stop  you press a button  to Atlanta  because I suspect  he's in Atlanta  because he's making  another movie  here is Samuel L. Jackson  there he is  are you shooting  something else  down there sir  oh it's just  a replay of the interview  okay  did they go back  to the apology  that was it  you sure 
[03:13:30]  I think so  okay  now  because he didn't  think  oh was that  the Captain America  if he would have  just said  oh yeah  I saw the Captain  America commercial  no I saw the  Captain America commercial  he didn't think of it  and then Samuel  went oh  because Samuel  was definitely  angry about that  he was like  just fine too  whatever  but that fucking  it was a good  moment  good live TV moment  but for it to end  with an apology  yeah  so now it's  don't mix  a person up  with someone else  or you'll be  misconstrued as racist 
[03:14:00]  I could even see  apologizing to  Samuel L. Jackson  like that  because it happened  at all  that's all  yeah exactly  he's an A-list celebrity  that's fine  but then to say  and anyone else  who was offended  who else  would be offended  that you mistake  someone for someone else  there's  it's preposterous  I agree  that's where we're at  because the black guy  was mistaken  for another black guy  first of all  you can mistake  white people  for other white people  it's very hard  to mistake  white people  for other black people 
[03:14:30]  or vice versa  so when that happens  it's okay  I don't get this  we are just so  fucking doomed  alright  we gotta go back  to break  to sell some stuff  oh great  got another song  from the Beatles special  Travis  did you like  the John Mayer one  it was okay  I was  which one did you like  who does he fuck  during the song  anyone  not hot  he was wearing weird  like 90's  baggy clothes  oh yeah  I'm trying to bring  that back 
[03:15:00]  I don't know  what he's trying  did you like  any of these  other performances  I don't know  what you have  the Eurythmics  were good  I didn't like  the Eurythmics  the Eurythmics  were good  Ed Sheeran  Ed Sheeran  was good  shut up  alright we'll do  Eurythmics  with Annie  Lennox  I thought she had  I thought Katy Perry's  was pretty good too  which one you want to do  which one you want  make a decision  Travis  you're fired  day after day 
[03:15:30]  don't want to hear  the man with the foolishness  keeping perfectly still  nobody wants to know him  they can see that he's just a fool  and he never gives  and that's all  but the fool  on him  sees the sun  going down 
[03:16:00]  and the eyes  in his head  see the world  spilling right far  where the lonely  stayed in a club 
[03:16:30]  and out of the thousand voices  he's just a fool  and out of the thousand voices  and out of the thousand voices  and out of the thousand voices  and out of the thousand voices  nobody wants to hear him  for the sound he appears to make  and he never seems to notice  but the fool  on him  sees the song  going down  and the eyes  in his head  see the words 
[03:17:00]  spilling right far  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  yeah  oh  yeah  oh  yeah  oh  oh  nobody seems to like him  they can tell  they can tell  what he wants  to do  and he never shows  his feelings  but the fool 
[03:17:30]  of him  sees the sun  going down  and the eyes  in his head  see the words  spilling right far  the fool  he never listens to them  he knows they're the fool  they don't like him but the fool  of him  He never listens to them, he knows that they're the fool 
[03:18:00]  They don't like him but the fool I feel  Sees the sun going down, and the eyes in his head  See the words, believe I'm one  Round and round, and round, and round

Okay, it was the summer  It was the summer going into my sophomore year of college  We were driving home from a bar  I was in the front seat of the cab  All my friends are in the back 
[03:26:30]  Oh, okay  But I remember choosing the front seat on purpose  Oh, why?  Because I'm a huge whore  Wait, did you  Did you get a look at the driver before you chose the front seat?  Yeah  And let me tell you  Disgusting  Wow, nice  He was like not  He looked like a cab driver  Right  I wasn't like  Oh, we hit the jackpot with the one hot cab driver  Oh, okay  I was wearing a mini skirt  Oh, boy  And a tube top  Which was my uniform at the time 
[03:27:00]  Even though I was another good two dozen pounds that I am right now  Oh, that's fantastic  I had no idea  A little chubby girl on the front seat  I had no idea  So I was sitting in the front  And my friends were in the back, waisted  And sort of one at a time they got out  And I was getting out with my last friend  Who was like asleep in the back  I think I just wanted to feel like I was really turning him on  Like making him go out of his mind  So I just was sort of like  Was sliding my leg over to him  Why am I saying this on here?  Oh, my God  While you're driving in the cab or while you're parked? 
[03:27:30]  Yes, while he's driving  How does he make the move?  So gross  How does he make the move?  All right  He didn't make the move  I took his hand and put it on  Oh, my God  I knew it  This is the greatest thing ever  You took his hand and just put it on your young 19-year-old  I put it on my skirt  And he  You know, we only had like 20 blocks to go  So I was like, this guy better get to work  Did you have panties on?  Yeah  Okay, so what did he pull them aside?  Moved them to the side  Oh, my God  I moved them to the side  Oh, you were just eager  You victimized him, basically  Yeah  Yeah, you raped the guy 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, he did what you do with a vagina  So he fingered you  He fingered me and rubbed my clitoris  Oh, was it good?  Until I achieved orgasm  Oh, you came?  I came  Oh, my God  And then he  Did you rub his dick?  No  I did not touch him  Did he ask you to?  Oh, no  But what happened was  We got where we were going  And so, like  My friend in the back kind of woke up  And he was like  Where are we taking this party?  Like, he was kind of like  Of course  Yeah  And I was  He was the winner of gas cab  Oh, my God 
[03:28:30]  So what happened?  He wanted to know  And what did you pay for the thing?  The cab?  Yeah  Did he make you pay?  Wow  What a dick  I love it  She wasn't going to jerk him off  He's like, alright  8.50  It was easier for him  To separate the dollar bills  Both me and Anthony are back  On with the fart jokes  On SiriusXM  We're rocking back to the show 
[03:29:00]  Oh, boy, are we  Crazy  Whitney Houston thing  Is already two years old  What thing is that?  You know  Her big  Singing the National Anthem  Oh, no  I thought that was longer ago  Her big adios  Oh  Wah, wah, wah, wah  And then  She made a big splash  Two years ago  Oh, boy  Did you  And it's already  24 years ago  That Buster Douglas  Surprised the world  By knocking out Mike Tyson 
[03:29:30]  But if you read the book  If you read the book  Isn't that just  There was no surprise there  David Johansson  What?  Oh, geez  Oh, wait a minute  If you read the book  Tyson was in no shape  To fight  Really?  He was all in  With his  Coca  Cocaine  24 years ago  24 years ago  And what was the deal?  There was a little controversy  Around that fight, right?  No, I mean  Buster beat him 
[03:30:00]  I mean  He  Wasn't there like  What was it?  The count was wrong  Or what the fuck?  Oh, yeah  You're right  What was it again?  Tyson knocked him down  Two rounds earlier  And technically knocked him out  But they gave him like  11 or 12 seconds  They gave him a little extra time  It was actually  Tyson technically  Should have won that fight  Because it was a bad count  Doesn't he show that  In his one man show?  Where he talks about it?  I'm not sure  I think he shows it  And then the place goes nuts  Because it's obvious  That it's 11 seconds  Wow  Or 11 and a half seconds  Whatever 
[03:30:30]  How do they not  Like have a replay  In boxing for that?  24 years ago  Yeah  You know  The refs still  Back then  They still should have  Been able to fucking  Like if the ref says it  It's over  It's over  Like even if he's wrong  Like even if he counts wrong  Yeah  What the fuck is that?  Yeah it's one of those things  Like you know  Like an umpire in a ball game  Kind of a thing  Yeah  Weird  That's a definitive  It's a definitive  Fucking counting thing  It should be a clock  You guys want to  Tick tock  Want a compliment?  We haven't taken a compliment  In a while  Let's do this  No one's had a clock  No one wanted to 
[03:31:00]  Brian in Pennsylvania  Brian  Brian  Hey  Morning boys  How you doing man  Alright  I just wanted to thank you guys  For doing what you do  For fighting the fight  That you fight  Because I'll tell you what man  After that last apology recording  That basically summed up  This country in a nutshell man  And as you guys as entertainers  Every day  You know you go out  And it takes away  All this crap  All this apology shit  And all this stuff  That you guys there  In your office  Have had to deal with  Has taken away  From what you can truly 
[03:31:30]  Truly muster up  And be as a show  We are heroes  The Marines  I think we're  I think we're a little lucky sir  Because  You know  Satellite Radio  Is still allowing us  To do it this way  Even though we bitch  About the place at times  Yeah  But the fact does remain  We do have a home  Where they leave us  The fuck alone  As far as the content goes  It's pretty amazing  Usually  Well  For the most part  I mean they'll yell at us  Like the Pat Cooper thing  Caused a little fucking tiff  Down the hall  But  But in the end 
[03:32:00]  We re-ran  The Pat Cooper thing  All weekend long  So it wasn't pulled  Or anything  Well I'll tell you what  Pat Cooper is fantastic  You guys are fantastic  Keep up the great stuff guys  Jimmy you were awesome  This summer  In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania  Thank you  Nice  Cool  Yeah I  I don't really see  A lot of people  Really doing this shit anymore  It's kind of  It's kind of disturbing  And quite sad  Oh no one could talk  About anything  That guy groveling on TV  Just because he  Fucking called  Sam Jackson

[03:33:00]  Oh I am  The laminates are 12  I'm 50 something  Uh oh  He's got your teeth  Nice  Nice  Yeah but what I found out  From the dentist  Later on  Is because the laminates  Are so much harder  Than the teeth  On the bottom  They grind them down  So tell Anthony  If you don't start  Wearing a night guard  Or something at night  And look completely  Fucking hard  In about five years  Your bottom teeth  Are going to look like  Little um  Civil war headstones  Oh really  What if I  What if I get

[03:34:30]  Unless he's with his mommy  That's weird  Yep  If you watch it  You can see how fucking  No rhythm is in the audience  White people definitely  Don't have any fucking rhythm  They're all moving like  It's ridiculous to watch  It's kind of funny  We know that  The other thing  That's kind of funny  Is I think Ringo's  Turned into fucking Fredo  He looks more like Fredo  Every day you see him  He's bouncing around  The fucking stage  McCartney looks like  Andrew Lansbury  Looks like an old lesbian  He's got nothing nice to say  Yeah why don't you 
[03:35:00]  Start talking nice  About people  Right  I was a little upset  They didn't get George  And uh  Oh see  They passed away  They could have did  A little bit more  Of a tribute  There were four of them  You know what I mean  They fucking have  Two of them up there  And they don't say anything  About the other two  Until the end  Oh they're gone  We appreciate them  What are they supposed to do  Stop every song  And go  One got shot  And one died  Doodah  Doodah  We know what happened  Imagine if you were just  Fucking stuck with somebody

[03:36:30]  For you  But I mean it was  I didn't apologize  To anyone else  Who might be offended  No  You can apologize  For mistaking someone  For someone else  Obviously  But he  He put this other part  Of the apology  Like he was groveling  To you know  Please don't think  I'm a racist  I think we do  Apologize  Every once in a while  On this radio show  But we're not  Groveling assholes  About it  If you call someone  The wrong name  And they're right  In front of you  You might go  Oh shit  I'm sorry for that  I'm an idiot  I thought yeah  That type of shit  You might go like

[03:49:00]  She'd have 450 pounds  I didn't have a problem  With her weight  You know  We were able to go places  I met her at a restaurant  Standing in line at the bar  And talking to her  We talked for like  Two or three hours  And then we agreed to meet  And go on a date  Four months later  We bought our house together  And we got married  After she had gotten pregnant  Her weight went up to  I believe it was 630  After she had Liam 
[03:49:30]  She had a hard time  Taking the weight off  What?  You know  You gotta lose that baby weight  Of 630 pounds  I know women at times  Struggled with getting  The baby weight off  This is not baby weight  This is  She's not like  All the Hollywood actresses  Have personal trainers  You're 630 pounds  You monster  You're eating nachos  You fucking behemoth  Yeah  After she gave birth  To the rhinoceros  She had a tough time 
[03:50:00]  Losing the baby weight  Of course the baby rhino weight  630 pounds  That's a biggie  It has affected  Our relationship  Extremely  It's been  Many years now  Since we've actually  Slept in the same bed  Good  Right now  I'm her full time caregiver  So I can't go out  And earn money  We're just living  On her disability  Oh great  Right exactly  Fuck Edgar too 
[03:50:30]  Fuck him  Both of them  You're right  You're right  He's a waste  You fucking waste  Stop going in there  And feeding a monster  She can't get out of bed  So obviously  She cannot feed herself  So everything she eats  He has to bring over to her  So just bring her  And if she would  No I need  No  Here's what you eat  Right  This is what the doctor said  That's all you get  But I need my dumplings  Oh she loves her dumplings  She's a big fat selfish fuckwad  Yeah she really is  It's like  I understand it's an addiction 
[03:51:00]  And it's a hard one  But when you're making  The conscious decision  Yes  To eat dumplings  Instead of salad  Go fuck yourself  Disability  Go fuck yourself  Fat people and disability  Is infuriating  Fucking infuriating  You pig  It kind of is  Get off it  Well she should get paid  Oh yeah  Yeah  I don't agree Jimmy  We got Colin Quinn on the line  Oh  Colin  What are we doing  What are we doing wrong today  Nothing 
[03:51:30]  I'm just calling  Because I had a fun  Valentine's Day story  From 6th grade  You know  And I was in class  And you know  We weren't giving out  Valentine's  But some kid decided  On his own  To give this girl  Elba  A lovely Spanish girl  A Valentine  He starts crying  And screaming  And then the teacher  Grabs it  And like holds it up  And we all saw it  It was a bunch of hearts  With a bunch of  Hairy pussies  It looked like a serial killer's 
[03:52:00]  Fucking handiwork  That's a hell of a story  That's romantic  Cute  It's got all the features  Sure  A bunch of cooters  Yeah  Right  Alright that's all I have  That's it  Really  That's it  You're just sharing  A Valentine's story  Alright  That's a little  Story  Until next time  Colin  Thank you  Thank you  Call  Bye  I thought you were 
[03:52:30]  Going to yell at us today  I know  That was very nice  I know  She's a critic  I know  Jesus  I don't like you two  Caving into Colin  Every time  Fucking stand up  Backbone  Right  Penny gets ready for surgery  What surgery is this one now  That's the  This is the lap band  This is the lap band  Oh okay  Okay  So we start from the beginning  With this monster  Ultimately I think  It comes down to  Penny  She's going to live or die  I've cried at night  About it sometimes 
[03:53:00]  If she continues in this  Fashion  She could die  We need to do a quick pit stop  Premium chicken sandwich  Crispy or grilled  Crispy or grilled  Crispy  Grilled  Crispy  Oh I'm sorry  Make that crispy  We gambled with  See  See that's why  In that moment  She's a fucking pig  And he's a grovel  Crispy  That's why I have  No fucking tolerance  Whatsoever  You're paying for that  You can't have just  Grilled chicken 
[03:53:30]  That one fucking moment  Without it being a sandwich  You fucking slob  They're paying for that  With the disability money  She's getting  For being fat  So it just perpetuates  The whole fucking  Cycle of fat  Life is filled  With choices  Right there  It was a choice  That was a choice  And she decided  Fuck the choice  Crispy  Oh I'm sorry  He tried to correct it  By saying grilled  Right  He tried to say  Let's have  And he couldn't stand up  To the fucking monster  No  No  Tell her to shut up  And you know 
[03:54:00]  This old gag  But I would love  A crispy chicken sandwich  Right now  How great would that be  They are so tasty  You heard the boss  Crispy chicken sandwiches  For everybody  No no no  They are so god damn tasty  But you gotta make choices  Shitty choices sometimes  Yeah  I don't always eat  What I want to eat  Oh god  Yeah  Yeah I mean  But it's annoying  Because like  It's not like  I have the gift  Of metabolism  And I can eat cake all day  I would love some  Morton's carrot cake  But I can't have it  Crispy chicken sandwich 
[03:54:30]  Some fresh tomatoes  Maybe a little mayo  Just a little bit  A lot of mayo  Just a little bit  A dollop  A dollop  Yeah  Or a schmear  Some kind of cheese  Would be nice  Oh my god  Oh my god  With some nice french fries  Yeah  A nice load of cum  Throw a shit load of salt  On the french fries  Some ketchup  Crispy  Then you know  Warsh it down  With some kind of shake  This beverage  Who doesn't want to eat like that  Yeah  Oh I'm sorry  Make that crispy  We gambled with 
[03:55:00]  Every resource  My family has  Financially  We've had  Friends, families  Neighbors  People donating to us  Pigs  Honestly  If this is a fail  The failure is catastrophic  Wait a minute  So  So she understands  What everyone is doing  For her  And she  Could pay them back  By just ordering  A lousy  Grilled chicken sandwich  There  And she refuses not  No  Because she's a selfish pig  And it's a disease  Why  Tell me why that part of it  Is a disease  Also her fucking  It's a weird disease 
[03:55:30]  Because the choice  Does go into it  Like the idea is  You do make certain decisions  And that's the fucking  Tricky part of it  And that's a decision  She could make  And she's choosing  Not to make that decision  She's a selfish pig  Is what she is  And her fucking husband  Is a disgusting  Grobbling enabler  Every fucking drunk  Has enablers  Every drug addict  Has enablers  Every fat fuck  Has enablers  Don't leave me  The addict is bad enough 
[03:56:00]  And pathetic enough  And selfish enough  But 50  Not 50  But a percentage of it  Is the fucking enabler  Who just can't stop helping  Here you go  Don't kill it  He wins  This show is so schizo  I love it  What happened to sympathy Jimmy  I have sympathy  What happened to sympathy Jimmy  Realistic sympathy  Realistic  I'm not  I'm not  No no no  But I mean  I don't want to be 
[03:56:30]  I don't really need an answer  It's like  There's a difference  Between sympathy and empathy  And doormat  And like I empathize  I empathize with a fat person  Like that  Because it's a brutal addiction  And if she's trying  I'm behind her  And I support her  You don't see the trying part  There's no fucking trying  You got people  Putting their finances  Yeah  Yeah yeah  People are  Towards you getting better  The least you could do  Is fucking go  Oh fuck  I'll suffer through a grilled chicken sandwich  This one time  And groveling enabler  If he had argued with her 
[03:57:00]  And said you're trying to get better  Have grilled chicken  Yeah get used to it  And then she actually overrode him  And said  What are you going to do  Punch her in the face  He couldn't quickly enough  Go  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Don't leave me  Don't leave me  Don't leave me  Don't leave me  Yeah they should look into his issues  Fuck  If he was being honest  He would say  Yeah I don't really want her  Losing this weight  I like it this way  That's why he's with a big fatso  He doesn't want her to leave  Right  How many times are you eating  Oh okay  So now we fast forward 
[03:57:30]  This is the whole episode  In a nice five minute package  So she got the surgery here  Yes  Alright  And then she goes into  The doctor's office  To see how much weight  She's lost  With the surgery she got  Because not only  Does she get the surgery  But the doctor breaks down  A nutrition plan for her  Oh yeah  He goes  This is all you have to do  They could not give her  More help  Right  Than they are giving her  It's amazing  What this doctor is doing  They set her up with  You know  Nutritionists 
[03:58:00]  Therapy people  Whatever she needs  Anything she needs  Physical therapy  She fucking  Is just a piece of shit  It's like that fucking  Fatso on Long Island  Who just can  It's like  I'm sorry  I don't feel  Empathy  For the drunk driver  Who gets sober  Decides to drink again  And then runs into  Somebody again  Then gets sober again  And then decides to  Drink again  And runs into somebody  Yeah  It's like  You're making a choice  To not address  Your addiction 
[03:58:30]  Yeah  Let me say hi  To Cigars and Scotch  Hey  It's been a while  Brother  How are you?  Not for me  I've been here  What's going on?  Fuck yeah  CNS  This is one of the  Old timers  Cigars and Scotch  That's an unhealthy message  How long have you been  Listening for?  Since you started  WNEW  Jesus Christ  Right on  What do you got today  Brother?  I remember that one  For me  The enabler  Is the same person  I want to give  Every kid a valentine  Oh shit  You didn't just say  That to Jimmy  Oh boy 
[03:59:00]  Fuck  Oh no  No I don't  I don't  No I don't think  It's right  Because I think  The motive is different  I think the enabling  Motive  There's a patheticness  In the enabler  Where you're directly  Contributing  To the downfall  Of a person  You're not just  Trying to make  Somebody  Who is  You know  Probably  You're trying to  Make them feel good  Though  It's like  You know  This would be  More difficult  To say no  To big fat  So  Is making her  Feel sad  She's not happy  In the moment  She's not going to grow 
[03:59:30]  It's just  It's to make it all  Better now  It's just  I don't know  To me  It's just the same  Mentality  But do you not  See the difference  Between a 600 pound  Selfish woman  And a guy  Feeding her to death  And  Making  An uglier kid  Who's in kindergarten  Feel a little bit  Better about himself  Yeah  It's like  A 560 pound difference  But other than that  But I mean  Do you see  No difference at all  In those two scenarios  It's all well meaning  But  You're fucking up  The person in the end  But you don't see 
[04:00:00]  So you think that  If you're an enabler  And you're feeding  Someone's addiction  It's the same  As wanting all the kids  To get Valentine's Day cards  Well part of that  Is addiction too  It's like  Instead of learning  Like well maybe  The other kids  Don't like me  Because my personality  Sucks  I'll just get this  Anyway  Or sometimes  Like hey  Maybe not everyone  Likes me  It's the  Keep telling someone  They're special  It's all  It's all meant  To feel good  Yeah but  I understand  But the difference  Between an adult 
[04:00:30]  And I'm  When you say  Valentine's Day cards  We're not talking  High school students  Because I'd agree with you  But they're  Fucking really  Small kids  Who don't have  The mental  Wherewithal  To make the decisions  Or have the discussion  We're having  But that's how  You learn and grow though  That's how you find  Your way  Like early disappointment  It's also how you become  Extremely disenchanted  And unhappy too  Which breeds creativity  Sometimes it does  Sure  Sometimes it does  Sometimes it does 
[04:01:00]  But not always  Hey Mr. Cigars  Mr. Cigars and Scotch  Hey  I do appreciate  Your  Whenever a celebrity dies  Cigars and Scotch  Is the most tasteless  Horrible thing  What's some of your  Shirley Temple stuff  You had to have written some  Well I wrote one  How do you make a Shirley Temple  How  Dig a six foot hole  At grenadine  And maraschino cherries  See that  That's  Wow  I guess that's a hard one  All right brother  I want to move on  To these clips  Thank you  I disagree with 
[04:01:30]  It's being the same thing  I think you're  Absolutely correct  Cigars and Scotch  Cigars  The letter N  Scotch  On Twitter  Oh there you go  Thank you sir  Thanks for being  Faithful to our show  Oh yeah  As others have  Tapped out over the years  Great  Goodbye  Goodbye  Oh shut up  Go  Fucking don't tell me about it  Just go  You think I call a fucking  Television station  When I stop watching  Hey  I owe you to watch 
[04:02:00]  But I don't  Because I've changed  I don't want to acknowledge  And I've changed  So I'm going to blame  For you  Oh just  Fuck off  Give a fuck  We still have enough  As long as we have enough  People listening  That's all the matters  In the end  Call the station  It's just this ludicrous  Fucking  How about you take  A little responsibility  No  I get put in check  Almost every night  You know  Performing  Almost every night  I'm put in check  At one moment  During my set 
[04:02:30]  Some nights  It's a lot of being  Put in check  Some nights  It's not as much  But there's always a moment  Where I'm kind of like  Eh  Alright  You're not fucking  Infallible  Oh  You know  Yeah  Alright so after surgery  They check on Penny  To see how it's going  Yeah  How many times  You're eating  Three times  That's it  Are you able to finish  The whole thing  You're eating  A meal  No  Unless you eat  The better I do  I'm like five or six  But the miracles  Are happening  That you haven't lost  Any weight  No I've definitely  Lost weight 
[04:03:00]  Well let's check  Your stomach  Okay  Keep in there  Oh you don't want  Get out  Really  Your belly  Don't look like  You have lost anything  Oh my god  I used to have  A wad like this  To take my needles  And now it's this  Penny  Not really  Making the changes  That we wanted  To make  Psychologically  And cooperate  And become  A person  That wants  To get well  Look at my nightgown  It goes all the way  I don't need  To look at the nightgown  You can get up 
[04:03:30]  And stand up  On a scale  We can check you  Exactly  I can't stand today  Honestly  I'm too weak  I can't stand today  I can't stand today  She's disgusting  She can't even  Stand today  The doctor's saying  You're not losing  Any fucking weight  She's a disgusting  But how does he know that  Just by looking at her  Just looking  He knows  Okay  He's one of those doctors  He could tell  He sees this shit  Every day right  Yeah  Oh she's hateable  Penny's hateable  She won't even stand up  No  I can't stand today  To get on the scale 
[04:04:00]  Work  Get the fuck up  You pig  Now six months  After the surgery  Six months  Penny checks in  From home  I need to get  Something in me  And I feel like  I'm dropping  All my sugar  There's really  Only so many  Popsicles  And soups  And cream of wheat  You can take  Before you're done  With it  Oh  I see  I cannot function  Without wontons  They're not the best  Thing for  No they're terrible  For you  Without what  Wontons  Wontons 
[04:04:30]  I can't function  First of all  How about this  Piggy  Pork  You've had  Your fill  Yes  You've had  Your fill  You've had  Enough  Wontons  You've treated  Yourself enough  You've spoiled  Yourself enough  Yeah  And you can  Fun  They're not  A little bad  For you  No  They're fucking  Terrible  For you  You morbidly obese  In denial idiot  Everything about them  Is against  The money that you've gotten 
[04:05:00]  Your son  Your husband  Your useless husband  The family and friends  That have given you money  The doctor  The surgery  All that  That wonton  Goes against all that  Yeah  They're not the best thing  For me  Farting  Doctor is out  And it's gonna be like  Why is she eating that  But I  I can eat all of this  By myself  And it wouldn't be as detrimental  To me  As not eating  I don't know if I'm right or wrong  Because I'm a doctor 
[04:05:30]  But the deep brain  I felt that was healthier  Than us were  What  The rationalization going on here  Is bizarre  She on one hand  Is saying  She's got like  This big tub  Of fucking pork  And she's mixing it up  To make wontons  Right  And then  She says  You know  It would be worse  For me  To not eat  Than to eat this  So I'll eat this  And then the guy says  This is better  Deep frying this shit  Is better than ordering takeout 
[04:06:00]  Yeah  So he rationalizes it that way  This seems exhausting  They're a deep fryer in his house  They're deep frying shit  This is exhausting  She's bedridden  She's still completely bedridden  Because of her fat  She's on the government till  Because of her fat  And they're deep frying stuff  And he's just  The fact  Are they this dumb  I couldn't tell you  The last time  I deep fried something  Deep fry  But  I would love to  Oh  Can you imagine  Would you not want 
[04:06:30]  Deep frying some wontons  Right now  Who wouldn't want that  What a fucking  Little soy sauce  Oh wonderful  But I need these wontons  I need them  There's only so much soups  So they're forcing her  To go to the doctor  For a six month checkup  Yeah  Forcing her  Because obviously  She doesn't even want to do that  Nah  She doesn't  I have spent the last six months  Giving it all I have  To lose weight  And have been successful  In losing weight  No you haven't  Did you guys put me  Over your head 
[04:07:00]  So you weren't going  To leave after  I would like the scale  To be lower than last time  Because that's my goal  Every time I step on it  She's still losing  So what's going on with you  It's going good  Lots of nice new  Hanging skin  Everywhere  Well hanging skin  Is not a problem  What is your weight doing  Oh I haven't been able  To be weighed  How come  I don't have a scale  Oh  You don't walk around  No  Not yet  We weigh you right now 
[04:07:30]  And you see how much you lost  Ah  Oh it's a lot of pain  Oh she's trying to get up  She's  Ah  Ah  Ah  Oh attention me  You can't have a  You can't have a goal  If you're deep frying  Deep frying wontons  You can't say you have a goal  At that point  Deep frying wontons  You have hope maybe  Maybe  That you can change  But that's not an official goal  You're looking for a miracle  You're not in the goal phase  Yeah  And you haven't lost any weight 
[04:08:00]  You gained weight  Since the surgery  Okay  You should be right now  Walking  You should be around  250 pounds  250 pounds  You should be  What we have here  Is failure  To lose weight  Yeah  To lose weight  Same guy right  He's a little Indian guy  Is he  Yeah  So she's put weight on  Since the surgery  Yes  She's gained weight  That's pretty much impossible  Yeah that's  At first anyway  I guess eventually what  You stretch everything out  And you can start  She dropped a very little bit 
[04:08:30]  Of weight  Maybe  What's the word  Maybe 30 pounds  I was going to say 280  Very little  And then she just started  Gaining weight again  Because she eats  Fried food  You should be around  250 pounds  She should be off  Walking  I feel that the scales  Were wrong in the beginning  And that I weighed more  Than what that was  How wrong could the scales be  Look Penny  Quit crying  Because this is  For your benefit  Okay  You know how many people  Like you 
[04:09:00]  I signed their death certificate  And later on  I thought  What could I have done  To get across to them  And I'm not getting  Across to you either  There has been change  Look  I mean it's hanging  Off my shoulders  You're just  Trying to convince yourself  Okay  Whatever you're saying  So you can't convince yourself  That your sleeves  Come past your hands now  And they never did that  Penny  I can reach my vagina  And clean it myself  I knew you do that  Six months ago  What you're saying 
[04:09:30]  It really makes no sense  Okay  Then I'm going to have  To just go home  Where I can  Try and get  Something else  I don't think this conversation  Is getting anywhere  It's your life  And your decision  Oh god  Just a selfish  Selfish fuck  She's trying to tell the doctor  That yo my skin is hanging  This that  The scale doesn't fucking lie  She's gained weight  And then she's trying to say  The scale  I think the scale was off  When I first got on it 
[04:10:00]  It's like how  It was off by 250 pounds  And plus  That way they can't check  The scale now  Right  Like if she said  The scale's broken now  They could just say  No it's not  No it's not  I think maybe before  I'm just  And then she's just  I'm just going to go home  And lay in your  Your fat woman's stink bed  Your fat bed  And eat  And fucking  And sickening  Groveling  Fucking awful  Codependent slob  That's married to her  Fucking 
[04:10:30]  Fucking  And he'll  And he'll justify  All day too  Oh yeah  I just was  I thought it was better  To  I just didn't  Because he has  Zero backbone  None  Zero  Don't leave me  Don't leave me  Where is she going  How is she going to leave you  She can't even move  Can we see these monsters  How cool would it be  Yes with Google Earth  I mean where you get to  Knock on the door  And they go  Come on in  Oh wow  Ew  They just set up an exhibit for you 
[04:11:00]  How cool would that be  You put a dollar in the box  Outside their house  Something like that  Amazing  Seeing a woman  Taking up an entire  King sized bed  Yeah  That would rule  The fucking  When they took her to the hospital  For that  To weigh  Like  The ambulance has to show up  Right  The fucking ambulance shows up  The fire department  The fire department  Has to now show up  The fucking fire department  And put her  And take her sheets  And lift them up  And haul her outside 
[04:11:30]  It's a big thing  Who funds the fire department  Yeah exactly  Oh  Yeah  Let's  We gotta  We gotta speed this along  Because we have  Someone calling in as well  After nine months  Penny won't go to the doctor  So a nutritionist  Nutritionist  Goes to her house  Yeah  I think I was told  By the doctor  I failed  Because I didn't meet  What goal he wanted  But I didn't have  The appropriate tools  Given to me  Come in  See you have the appropriate tools  Given to me 
[04:12:00]  So  Dr. Nelson  I didn't ask me  To come meet with you  Right  And so what I want to do first  Is get a little history  What was your motivation  For seeking out surgery  I'm sorry  And you can take this  Root if you want  But I find that  To be an asinine question  Okay  So like  The motivation is obviously  I swear to God  Just let her die  Who gives a fuck  Exactly  Who gives a fuck  Here comes a woman  Part of this giant team  That's there to help  What's wrong with these  Psychologists  Psychiatrists 
[04:12:30]  And nutritionists  Just go  Alright you know what  I'm wasting my fucking time  There's other people  That I'm an expert  At this shit  That I could actually help  So go fuck yourself  Die  You know  Die  It's an asinine question  It's not  She's gonna go  I needed to lose the weight  What's your motivation  To get out  To get out of bed  To see your kids  What a fucking  What a belligerent pig  There are so many people  That need help  And that probably  Would do way better  At the help  So you just let this one go  Fuck  You don't need to save everyone  Fuck her  What's her explanation 
[04:13:00]  For why it's an asinine question  Because Penny's about to tell her  Why it's an asinine question  Oh sure  I've watched like  Three of these shows  I've watched like  1800 pounds  Of this show  And this woman  Is the most hateable  Fucking thing  The other people  Are amazing  They lose weight  They're trying  They're working  I like that we bring  Some of this to our show  But there's no fucking way  I'd be able to watch this  Regularly  No cause the other people  Fuck them  The other people  Are very good  They realized  And they work at it  And actually lose weight  Realized that 
[04:13:30]  Hello  They're proud of themselves  Their family helps  A life raft  Grab it  And this fucking pig  Who wouldn't  She just  Looking a gift her  In the mouth  Playing into her shit  Go alright  You know what  Do it your way  Yeah  I got someone else  To see anyway  Go you know  I'm gonna go  Later bye  Yeah  So listen how she treats  This fucking woman  Okay  So like  The motivation is obviously  To lose weight  And regain what  It's to get back 
[04:14:00]  Whatever you haven't  Had because of it  Or do you have goals  Of having certain  Meeting certain  Nope  Expectations  That you may have  Absolutely not  Will not do that  Will not do that  It's a way for people  To very easily  Get comfortable  Sit on their laurels  And not achieve  To their best ability  Good for you  Good for you  So she won't make goals  Yeah I don't make goals  Yeah that was piggy  That was piggy  Yeah I know  Good for you  Yeah  And excuse  Trying to use  Therapeutic lingo 
[04:14:30]  To justify  Right  Why she's a fucking  Lazy lump  Yeah  Well you got the nutritionist  Now going through her  Kitchen  Now remember  This lady can't go  To the supermarket  So now we have to  Fucking point the finger  At the husband  Uh huh  That's it  What's in the kitchen  She goes through the kitchen  You wanna check the fridge first  While you're in there  She can help you  Clean it out  Oh yeah  Look  We got the ham  We got corn and potatoes  Coleslaw  Uh eggs  Uh and then that's the pie 
[04:15:00]  The pie  Thanksgiving  What do we have here  That's the pie for Thanksgiving  Pie for Thanksgiving  Maybe you don't have pie  This Thanksgiving  You know because  Sorry  Because pig needs another treat  Right  Instead of telling pig  Hey you can't have it this time  Because you're  Inconvenience to everybody  Pig needs another treat  Pig needs a treat  Pig need treat  Slob give pig treat  That's what this show  Should be  Uh  A few million cupcakes  For Liam  My son  He's not a candy eater  A cookie eater  He's got like 
[04:15:30]  Set things  That  No I am a cookie  He gets a bedtime snack  And one snack a day  So we have  Some cereals here  They're in there  Trying to make them  Throw away your cereal  Mommy said  Not till you're 18  That you are gonna have  All the cereal you want  You wanna have  Nutrient dense foods on hand  You want foods  That give you vitamins  And protein  And give you fiber  I know what's in there  Is not good  I think maybe  I made a bigger impact  With Edgar  Than perhaps Penny 
[04:16:00]  I think he maybe now  Has some better knowledge  About what to look for  At the grocery store  It's not police  Egg whites are great protein  Think of produce  Egg whites  Vegetables  I'm not eating just whites  I hate just whites  I'm hoping if anything  That he gets a benefit  That he can make better choices  At the store now  Oh so what you think  I think it was  A bunch of  This is stupid  Just go  Do it your way though 
[04:16:30]  She is a hateable  Fucking pain  Hateable  You wanna take a guess  As to what cereals  She wouldn't throw out  That she wouldn't  Stop giving her songs  Sugar pops  Fucking all that garbage  I'm gonna go with  Captain Crunch  And Frosted Flakes  I did  Opie's favorite was there  Lucky Charms  For the win  Oh yeah  Lucky Charms  I don't do Lucky Charms  Right now  Right  I'm dying to have a  Fucking bar  To Lucky Charms  Give yourself a little  Treat here  Take it away for a while  Oh shit  Her fucking husband  Should literally  Just bring her  Certain things  And say this 
[04:17:00]  Is what I'm bringing you  Cause she can't  I ain't eating it  Then don't  Then don't eat  Don't eat  Bye  There you go  And then shut the door  To where pigs die  Yep  That's it  Bye  Final clip  Penny goes in for her  One year checkup  One year  She should be  After the surgery  Right  Moving around  Active  Exercising  Everything  Yeah  One year  With that surgery  If you weigh 630 pounds  Safe to say  You could easily have lost  200 pounds in a year  Right  More than that  Probably  More than that 
[04:17:30]  I was being conservative  You're supposed to  Lose  In a year  I think in a year  Yeah  You're supposed to lose  A lot in that first year  Yeah  You can lose  Like if you're  600 something pounds  When you go in  You can  The doctor was saying  You can lose  400 pounds in a year  Right  400 pounds  She should be  Up moving around  To exercising  Yeah  Yeah  Let's see what happens  Let's see how much she lost  Oh  Hey  I try everything  I don't know  How I'm gonna get across to you  It's very difficult 
[04:18:00]  Living in a world  Where  I've given you my life  And  Put you as  My earthly god  And that's what I mean  I don't want to  No matter what you say  The truth is  In this gap  I know  I know  Okay  Penny lives in  False reality  And she choose to overeat  She does not admit it  The people that  I operated the same time  I did your surgery  Today  They're 250 pounds 
[04:18:30]  Great  I'm feeling like  I've just been  Sucker punched again  Why didn't this do  What it's supposed to do  What I'm doing  What I'm supposed to do  Where's my  Where's my yellow brick  Why didn't I get it  Because I'm working hard  It's crushed on your feet  It's gravel  It could  At this point  Yellow glass  Penny has  An intention to change  Anything in her lifestyle  I don't know  What would work  For Penny 
[04:19:00]  I hope  She wakes up  At some point  Where's mine  Otherwise I don't think  She's gonna live too long  Yeah  Oh well  For me  The things that are  Going to come  Are going to be  More important  Than the things  I've already overcome  Oh shut up  What does that even mean  She needs to be told  By somebody  You're self-centered  In the extreme  Yeah  And you're  Extraordinarily selfish  And the second she goes  No you are  You say shut up  Your problem is  Punch her in her liver  Yeah but you just  You want what you want 
[04:19:30]  When you want it  You're queen baby  Big baby want  What big baby want  That's it  And that's it  And your husband  Is a groveling  Codependent slob  You just walk away  Yeah  Walk away  And see if she gets the hit  I'm like oh fuck  They're not putting up  With my bullshit  Everyone knows  Their bullshit  At the end  You just know  Your bullshit  And when someone  Calls you out  You're like oh fuck  Right  When you go to detox  They don't say to you  Would you like a beer  Bring me a beer  You sit there 
[04:20:00]  And get nothing  No  I mean they might put you  On certain medication  To help the physical  But they're not  Bringing you beer  They're not bringing you meth  This should be treated  Like that  Where you detox her  And just give her  Healthy food  Right  I don't want it  Well then when you  Lose the weight  Yeah you can get up  And get your fucking  Lazy ass in there  Get it yourself  Get it yourself  Oh that looks good  Is there any more of those  Thank you  It's a honey bar  I don't want that one  I thought he pulled  His fly down  It's always  We got a 
[04:20:30]  Dick sucking joke  So what  What happened with that  At the end  That was it  Nothing  He gave up  He gave up  Oh good  Good for them  Yeah  I want to say hi  To my pal  Kirk Fox  What's up Kirk  What's going on  How did that end up  Did she eventually  Eat the doctor  We can only hope  The doctor was consumed  Much like Quint  Yeah where you at  With the enablers there  Kirk Fox  Listen I heard most of that  Was water weight  Was that true  Yeah  She drank a small  Swimming pool 
[04:21:00]  She's disgusting  We have no tolerance  For that shit  On this show  Listen I just want you  I've lost a lot  Of my baby fat  So I'm rocking and rolling  A strong 190  If anyone's interested  Yes you're  You're the thin fellow  You do the test  Obviously  Which is doing very well  Have you had some  Of these fatties on  Some of these monsters  Listen there's been  Some people with  A little extra weight  But I just stay  Out of the middle 
[04:21:30]  I do not want to  Ever get squished  Yeah  Very non-confrontational  I've seen the show  I've seen the show  Quite a few times  Yes  Yeah a lot of  The clientele  Is a little rotund  But there's also  Some skinny people  You know  Meth  That is true  Meth  Right  Hood rats  Are usually skinny  That's right  A lot of hair  Yes a lot of hair  Listen these people  Are coming on  And I'm changing lives  That's all I know  Well I gotta congratulate you  Because you know 
[04:22:00]  You're in a  You're in a tough  Fucking business man  Like look at  Look at poor search  She's already done  Oh  Is that done that show  Pretty much  Right  He didn't get picked up  I don't think  The search got picked up  The search was on  Right after you  In New York  I mean do we know  That for sure  I mean I think  He was just doing  A little trial run  He was doing a try out  We'll see if he gets  Picked up  Right  You know  There's room for  All of us  Because this ain't  No game  People  This ain't no game  People  Oh wait I'm talking  To white people  Hi how are you  Right 
[04:22:30]  The sweater helps  The sweater makes  Some more  The sweater does help  Yes  Tom's it down a little bit  Kind of like how you  Shaved your mustache  To be the host  Of the test  Listen do you have  To bring that up  You know  You know I miss my stache  I haven't been able  To do any crime  Since I've shaved it  Yeah  You look like  You have some credibility  Without the mustache  Yeah but listen  If the show keeps going  I'm going to  I'm going to just fight  For that stache  To come back  I hear you  Yeah you could  Start calling the shots  Yeah what kind of things 
[04:23:00]  Are you tackling  On the test these days  Infidelity  Family feuds  Paternity disputes  Anything that anyone  Needs to know  I mean there's a lot  Of shit that you guys  Probably need some  Answers to  Ah not really  We got a guy on the show  Today with 33 kids  17 mothers  Oh my god  We're tackling a lot of stuff  How did you find  The guy that has  33 kids with 17 moms  You should be having  That guy give advice  To other guys  How to get pussy  Instead of criticizing  You're going to be  Praising this guy 
[04:23:30]  I think the kids  Are all the same age  So that was a hell  Wow  That is some  33 kids  17  Are you going to have  All 17 moms on  We couldn't afford  To get that many tickets  Yeah  Yeah  We actually have  Two women that are on there  Fighting over this guy  So  Listen this guy is in demand  Yeah that amazes me  The women fight over these guys  That's fucked up man  I don't get it  I haven't even created one  So 33 seems like  A high number 
[04:24:00]  Why would you want to do that  I don't get it  What's the common denominator  In these people  That have these kids  Like this  They don't know  What a condom is  Oh  See  Well a condom  Is something  That feels awful  Tastes awful too  God damn it  He just wasn't ready for it  He wasn't  Yeah yeah  I thought we could do that  Right on stage  Just tighten a knot  But I couldn't  I couldn't get to it  Oh man  I don't get that shit  I was always so paranoid 
[04:24:30]  Getting a chick pregnant  I don't understand  How fucking  People are willy nilly  About that shit  Listen I'm still scared  I don't even have sex  I'm so frightened  Well you gotta grow  The mustache back  That'll do it  And then I can just take it  Oh the old flavor saver  Right  Am I right  How's New York  I miss you guys  I gotta come back there  I gotta tell you  New York sucks  We're having a real fucking winter  For the first time  In many years  I hate it  I mean LA sucks too 
[04:25:00]  I mean I had to play tennis  For like five hours yesterday  Oh man  Stuff I needed to do  Yeah so we shouldn't complain  You guys are pussies out there though  It gets 55 degrees  And you're wearing fucking  Winter coats  That's if you have the balls  To go outside  If it's 55  I'm staying in  What's wrong with you people  All of a sudden  You got a North Face jacket on  It's 55 degrees out  Relax  How do you not get angry  At these people  That you're on your show  And just say to them  What the fuck are you doing  What's wrong with you  How do you not scream at them  I always remember  That I'm getting paid 
[04:25:30]  Oh right  Nice  Would that hurt the show or no  I just take it  I think about a lot of other things  And I know I have security there  But you're very non-judgmental  On that show  I've noticed  But it's gotta be  It's gotta be  I'm going with Jimmy's point  It's gotta be strange for you  Cause you're a comic  So I mean  You see some of this  Whacked out shit in front  And you really wanna like  Go off I believe  Well you're absolutely right  But it's tricky  Because they're real people  And they need this answer 
[04:26:00]  So if I make a joke about it  I could lose them  And then they  And then they stop talking  Or  Right  Or they get angrier and angrier  And I'm trying not to incite it  Right  The trick for me  I gotta tell you  Is trying to get to that resolution  I think that's what's making the show  Resonate with some people  That it's not just about the conflict  A lot of the other shows  They want that fighting  But listen  I am  I'm a pussy  At heart  So there is resolution  What type of resolve 
[04:26:30]  Do you get on these  With these people  Listen  If these people need an answer  They're gonna get an answer  I would think the answer is always  You're a bunch of assholes  Yeah  No  You sometimes find out  That the women are just paranoid  And that the guys aren't cheating  Paranoid of what  Shutting their legs  Yeah  That's scary sometimes  It can be scary  Sometimes it's hard  If you've got 600 pounds  It's tough to close your legs  Well that's true too  Okay  Alright  See I'm learning  Good point  When is the test on there Kirk 
[04:27:00]  Well you can go to thetesttv.com  It's on every day  I think it's on at 3 o'clock  Right there in New York  3 o'clock  That's right  You guys are all over the country  So is the test  WPIX  If someone goes to thetesttv.com  They can check their local listings  Yes  I love the local listings  Are you officially in your second season?  We're shooting some stuff right now  I mean  Is anything ever really official?  No  Hmm  No  No  I'll say no  Exactly 
[04:27:30]  Was I right?  I think  I think it's coming  I'd like to believe it is  I think you just tested us  Yeah  That was a pop quiz  That was a pop quiz  And doing some TV  So I'd like to believe it's coming back  That's a good sign  I'll come to New York  And I'll work with you guys  Sounds good  I think it is  I think it is  I bet you they're happy  Very well  I would think so  I mean I'd like to have a job  Well yeah  It's my first job  You know  So why would I want it to end?  Yeah you got regular work  I've never worked before this 
[04:28:00]  That's crazy  You got regular work for once  Instead of hearing their stuff  But I can always go back to teaching tennis  I still got my shorts  I got my Sergio Takini shorts  That's right  And I still got my basket of balls  He's the tennis guy  Yeah  I'm not afraid to go out there  And teach some tennis  Tennis pro  Nice  Yeah I'll grow the mustache back  And I'll get right back to work  Get them chicks  Who is that a myth?  I mean like as a tennis pro  Were you ever able to bang any of the girls?  Uh  I was supposed to 
[04:28:30]  Oh  What happened?  You just decided against it?  No  Listen  I think that comes into play  Yeah  I didn't start teaching tennis  Just for the money  You do that thing  Where you stand behind them  And hold the racket in their hand  And go  And you swing like this  And you push your hard penis up  Against their butt  And just lay on the court  He doesn't even do that  Just lay him on the court  You don't need that nonsense  No  Skip right  Did you really want to learn  How to play tennis? 
[04:29:00]  Alright  You know what  You're a direct  Right to the point guy  That's the  Who was the most famous person  You talked tennis to?  Uh  You know  Mel Gibson  We played a little tennis  Come on  Really?  Listen  You name it  I've taught them tennis  Every job I've ever gotten in a movie  Was because I was teaching them tennis  That's fucking weird  God damn  Good deal right there  But then the problem was  Is they would keep me on the movie  For three months  But I'd only get one line  Because  They just wanted me playing tennis 
[04:29:30]  Oh  They just wanted to keep you playing tennis  So they wanted to keep me on location  It was tricky man  Yeah  It's a nice gig though  I did Wyatt Earp  And  You know  I was there for three months  I think I had one line  But we did play a lot of tennis  And  I was a real small horse  So that I wouldn't get hurt  What a great mustache  For Wyatt Earp  By the way  Oh  That's what they were hiring  That's what  You have to be hired  You got hired  Because of the mustache  They weren't hiring me  For my chops  Right  Fucking  Kirk Fox 
[04:30:00]  My lamb chops  Well listen  We got to cut this short  We got meetings and shit  You guys got shit going on  Yeah I apologize  That we got to you so late today  But  That's okay  I can go right back to bed  Nice  Sounds good  So lucky  Kirk Fox and the test  Doing very well  Let's take a look at that people  Alright and I'll see you soon  Hope I'll be out there  Sounds great  We look forward to it  Hey Jim  Maybe one day you'll follow me on Twitter  I mean I know you're just  You know  Afraid to  What's your Twitter name  What do you think it would be  It could be Kirk Fox

[04:44:00]  Now  Now  Now  Look back on another  Legendary day of broadcasting  This is the  O.P. and Anthony  Post Show  Post Show  With Sam Roberts  Roberts  Yeah it is  Let's reminisce together  Oh, what a great day today was  It's the Open Anthony Post Show  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number  Phone lines are wide open  866-969-1969  I'm joined by the beautiful pregnant Nicole from the Morning Mashup 
[04:44:30]  Oh, that was so sexual of you  Wide open  You found that to be very sexual  I did, maybe that's because I'm super horny, but I liked it  I'm glad that you haven't, as you are becoming much closer to becoming a mother  Yeah  You haven't lost the horniness  No  And the lust  It's heightened  For sex, it has heightened  Yeah  Huh  I need it  You're going to have a baby next week, correct?  Uh-huh  Oh my God  And then how long until sex?  I think another six weeks  But if I can go before that, I've got to get an inmate 
[04:45:00]  Are you going to?  I just didn't  What do you mean you've got to get it in you?  A dick?  Yeah  A dick  What are you going to do with the baby when it comes time to be intimate with your husband?  She can go to sleep  Okay  So you're going to have sex with her in the room?  I mean, if it has to happen that way  It's going to happen that way  Well, you can't be irresponsible and leave the baby by  It's lonesome  I mean, she'll be sleeping, we'll just be quiet  Will you be quiet, though?  I don't know, actually  What about the first time back?  Perhaps not  Have you done anything?  Like, you came on this show once and said that you like to jerk off an X and see how far it could shoot 
[04:45:30]  Have you been doing anything like that?  I have not done that  Actually, I really should  No, I told you  Just a lot of blowjobs  I don't like doing the jerk-off thing  Right  Only for sport, like for that  Right  Otherwise, it's not really fun for me  And you can do it better than me  Unless there's a game involved  Right  Well, now that you've gotten to know Nicole a little better  Let's find out what today's line of the day was  You ready, Eric?  All set  All right, let's hear it  Here 
[04:46:00]  Comes  Line of the day  Line of the day  Last night, this one kind of, yeah, yesterday afternoon, kind of broke  Lawrence Fishburne, is he going to be in RoboCop?  Uh  Because he's in RoboCop?  Or Samuel Jackson?  So you're doing  Samuel Jackson is in RoboCop  You were doing the same thing that the newscaster did  Whoa  But  Oh my God, I think I just did 
[04:46:30]  Yeah  But I'm saying the Lawrence  Oh, whatever  E-Rock's true motivations are so coming out  Sal has not been here the past couple days  Right  Because he has a throat infection  Ooh  I believe the back of his throat got poked by some kind of blunt object  Oh  Could have been the penis  I'm not quite sure what it was  But  Just guessing  E-Rock has been running the board  Okay  And this is the second day in a row  Where Line of the Day  Has been  Has been made to look  Has been  Done to make Opie look silly  Is Opie annoyed about it? 
[04:47:00]  I don't know  I don't think he realized yesterday  Oh no  Yesterday  The Line of the Day  Was Opie saying  He didn't want  To share dudes  With his chick  Wait, but Opie  Don't feel bad  Because I did that too  On the air today  On the mashup  What did you say?  I said to Rich  Can you pull up that Dennis Rodman clip  Because I had a story about Dennis Rodman  But I wanted the Samuel L. Jackson  So I just mixed up my black eyes too  Yeah, but Opie did it in the exact same other black guy  That the news anchor did  That we were preparing to make fun of 
[04:47:30]  Hey, it happens  E-Rock, are you going out of your way  To make Opie look silly?  No, I just thought that was the best line  Out of what we had pulled  It was pretty funny  All right  Okay, if you say so  Do you want me to play you a runner-up?  Yeah, sure  Okay  I will give you  I bet it's going to make Opie look silly though  If E-Rock's behind it  I'll give you this one  Uh-oh  I'm nervous  Well, thanks for asking  What's in the Nutribullet today?  Well, you got some leafy spinach  Back to the Nutribullet  Kale  Oh 
[04:48:00]  I took Sam's suggestion  Uh-oh  And put cum in it  Put cum in it  That was not my suggestion  Is he like on a health kick-o?  Oh, well, we're all using Nutribullets on the show now  Are you?  Me, Eric, and Opie are  Wow  I'm not missing anybody, am I, Eric?  We're the Nutribullet gang  Uh, no  Roland got something different  Just call yourself the Nutribullet gang  You're right  Forgive me  The Nutribullet posse  Okay  That's better  That's much better  Throw your bullets up  That's right 
[04:48:30]  And we've been comparing  Yesterday, E-Rock was having beet juice  He told us all  I can't imagine you doing  Putting that many exciting things  In your Nutribullet  Well, you heard what Opie's was just now  Yeah, it's healthy  Proud of him  And did you hear him say  That he took my suggestion  My suggestion wasn't cum  What was it?  It was orange  Orange, that's a great suggestion  Sweeten it up  And vitamin C  Vitamin C for anybody listening in the UK  Okay  I put, like, today it was banana, apple, raspberry, kale 
[04:49:00]  Okay  With a boost  You gotta do a boost  I'm so proud of you  Chia seeds is the boost  Isn't chia, aren't chia seeds supposed to be like the help you say youthful?  They're a superfood  Okay  They're a superfood  Alright  That's amazing  Well, I feel like you're a bit turned on right now  I am a new, healthier, opium, Anthony, posse  That's right  Nutribullet posse  I'm sorry  Yes  No man  And I believe the reason that you're turned on by that is because of the lack of sex you've been having  Super horny 
[04:49:30]  No man in New Mexico  Hey, what's up, Proud of him?  What's up, buddy?  So, can you please explain to me?  I haven't got to see the 600-pound show  Does this fat pig, does she just lay in bed and shit all over herself?  Is that what happens?  We were watching my six  I mean, we were listening to clips of my 600-pound life on the show today  And yeah, it's this woman who refuses to lose any weight to get out of bed  Because she likes her dumplings too much  Her wontons  Sure, it's more than a few dumplings  She loves her wontons, though 
[04:50:00]  She won't give them up  And she's making all these excuses like  Well, it'd be less healthy for me to stop eating  Than it would be for me to eat these wontons  So I'm going to eat the wontons  And then her husband's there with her going  We figure if we use the deep fryer at home  It's more healthy than if we order out  That's what fat people say  Exactly  Yeah  So no, she doesn't shit all over herself all day long  But she does have a bedpan that she uses  Well, so she basically shits on herself  Yeah, that's true  I mean  And her husband, Edgar  And the wiping can't be proper 
[04:50:30]  His name is Edgar?  Yeah, her husband's name's Edgar  And he's a bit overweight himself  But he's still mobile  And he walks around  Cleaning out her bedpan and stuff  I'll tell you this  They are in love  And so it's a big  It's a big holiday coming up  And you know, the number one  Gift for Valentine's Day this year  This is where I come in  DJ Hookett just walked in  No  Everybody knows  Yeah  The number one gift for Valentine's this year  Is roses  Yes
