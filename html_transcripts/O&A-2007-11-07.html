<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a raucous and often offensive affair, featuring a chaotic mix of listener calls, pre-recorded bits, and off-the-cuff commentary.  The show heavily featured Dog the Bounty Hunter's apology tour following his use of a racial slur.  Numerous clips were played from his appearances on Hannity & Colmes and Larry King, showcasing his rambling, incoherent apologies and bizarre statements, such as claiming to use the N-word as a greeting, believing he had a special connection with Black America, and even suggesting he would kill himself for forgiveness or wanted to be buried with slaves at Mount Vernon. The hosts reacted with sarcasm and mockery, frequently veering into tangents about the oversaturation of greatest hits albums (specifically citing Kiss and The Doors), their personal lives (including Thanksgiving/Christmas plans), and sports (mentioning Greg Maddux's Golden Glove win).

Listeners called in with their own humorous responses to Dog's situation, often suggesting self-punishment, including suicide, as a condition for forgiveness.  The show also contrasted public reactions to Dog's slur with Alec Baldwin's verbal abuse of his daughter.  A parody song about Eminem needing to urinate was played.  The “Beep Game,” manipulating Dog's audio clips with strategically placed bleeps for comedic effect, was a recurring feature.  This led to a recollection of an embarrassing dinner with Dog and Dice, highlighting Dice's disruptive behavior at a high-end restaurant.  Further "Beep Game" segments focused on Dog's comments about George Washington's home and burial grounds. A listener, Tim, submitted a Dog apology which was discussed in relation to the beep game. The show also covered the "Two Girls, One Cup" video, playing listener reactions including those from D.L. Hughley.

A caller, Mike, discussed a news story about a man losing his job after a private conversation with his son, sparking a discussion on racism, with Opie controversially stating that some of his worst racist acquaintances were Black. This led to a debate about the impact of racial slurs.  The show also featured a recurring $1000 contest, with the winning sound clue being "How did your parents die?".  A humorous news clip about a reporter falling during a grape-stomping contest was also played. Jim Norton was a guest in the studio throughout a significant portion of the broadcast.

Another caller, Rich, recounted his Backstreet Boys concert experience, which included his daughter refusing to attend because of his presence, leading to jokes about his perceived "gayness." This transitioned into discussions about a Walmart upskirt incident involving a 13-year-old girl, a planned lip-sync promotional video for a New York television station (which they rewrote with sexually suggestive language), Maury Povich's show (specifically focusing on a dwarf cheerleader), and a homeless man using a church phone to call sex hotlines.  The hosts' reactions were consistently vulgar and frequently involved suggestions of violence. The planned promotional video was discussed in terms of the possibility of including blackface and Nazi uniforms.


A caller, Davin, planned to wake his roommate with a locomotive horn, leading to a discussion about Zach "Wild" wearing a dress in a mall, which devolved into sexually explicit jokes.  Jimmy Norton recounted the story.  The hosts discussed bowel movements and urination, referencing a listener-submitted website showcasing images of people's bowel movements after a colon cleanse. They promoted E-Rock Radio, hosted by Eric Nagel, and discussed an upcoming merger and the impact of Jim Norton's presence on XM radio stock.  Jimmy Norton promoted his Borgata show.  A bizarre promotion for a toy called the "O&A Party Rock" followed, alongside offensive commentary about E-Rock. E-Rock Radio segments, including "Jimmy versus Dragon Wagon," "Steve Bear Hunting," and Jim Norton's "Drill Diva" bit, were played. A heated, offensive exchange between a caller, Reg, and Jimmy Norton about a used drill ensued. Big Kev's lack of smell and resulting studio odor issues were discussed with uncomfortable detail. The show ended with Harry Potter-themed nicknames and a highly offensive and sexually explicit story from one of the hosts about his great-aunt's encounter with a Black apple truck worker, interspersed with racial slurs and sexually explicit songs.  A voicemail from an angry woman claiming harassment concluded the segment, followed by a child's innocent question and a jingle mentioning "badger lube."  The show also mentioned an upcoming Atlantic City show and a spoiled bit about a coworker who chews on pens, along with a discussion about body odor.  Throughout the entire broadcast,  the hosts discussed internal production problems.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shock, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free. I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-Rock in the bathroom.  they are sick 
[00:01:00]  can you pop this there  aim it over there  this is the worst  this is the worst show I've ever been on  but enough of this palaver  let's get the show on the road  morning 
[00:01:30]  you gotta be quiet  I was letting the music establish  just let it establish and sit there for a minute  people know  I just wanted  I don't want to do the usual like  good morning stuff  because it is wake up your spouse Wednesday  oh yeah  and I don't want to  have spouses waking up  inadvertently before their 
[00:02:00]  other  their significant other can do something horrific  to wake them up  we do have themes for every day of the week  we certainly do  today's themes are  whip them out Wednesday  a fine fine promotion  that we started  back in Boston  and continues to this very day  one of the classics I say  one of the classic O'Brien Anthony bits  classics  people seem to like that one 
[00:02:30]  when we first started Wow in Boston  it was insane  yeah  it's still happening  but it's a little more low-key unfortunately  but back in the day man  remember all the  homemade Wow signs  the construction workers  on the  on the side of like Route 9  yeah  just writing Wow  and everything they could find  huge  everything they could find  yeah  they were building  when they were putting up buildings  they would put big banners over the side  with Wow on them  yeah  yeah  it's still happening  yeah  I guess we just became 
[00:03:00]  busier with our radio show  yeah  we used to spend probably  two to three hours  a day  not even just on Wednesday  a day  talking about  whip them out Wednesday  and then we'd take calls  and it was cool and all  but then  after a while  how many times can you get  guys  it was great  I was driving  I have a stick on my car  yeah  and  this girl flashed me  she's so hot  and  she's like  driving a  a red 
[00:03:30]  um  a Ford  alright thanks man  okay  just proved we didn't have  as much material back then  because that was an exciting phone call  for us  yeah that would have been great  but it is happening  Wow  most of the radio stations were on  they have Wow stickers  uh  that represents  it represents  whip them out Wednesday  and uh  when women see that  you know  the women that are a little looser  a little looser  the women that are  a little looser 
[00:04:00]  a little looser  you know  the goers  no I'm just kidding  because actually  you get some soccer moms  that are into it  for some reason  oh yeah  but uh  some women are out there  and they'll see the Wow  and they will flash  because they see the Wow sticker  or the homemade Wow sign  or the Wow written in the dirt  in the back of a car  and they will flash  that is their sign  to go  oh okay  Opie and Anthony  whip them out Wednesday  boom  here you go boys  and then  they drive on  you drive on  and uh  and that's that  right  right  other themes for Wednesday 
[00:04:30]  uh  can't say that Wednesday  morning zoo bit of the day Wednesday  and of course  uh  my favorite  wake up your spouse  Wednesday  that is my favorite  although I like  can't say that Wednesday  you like can't say that Wednesday  yeah  I don't know what it means  what  what do we  what do we say that we can't say  oh I know what it means  what  yeah there are things that uh  you know you can't say on the radio  like what  and then you say it  and uh  there's a big problem

[00:13:00]  yeah every time  we don't have a  like a morning zoo  bit of the day  for Wednesday we  just grab a  Scott and Todd  bit  they are the go  to show for  hack here in  New York City  yeah they're awful  yeah they are  really really bad  and of course  it's can't say  that Wednesday  in just a few  moments I think  we're gonna start  talking about dog  the bounty hunter  Doug  what an idiot  how bad is this  guy want to  save his TV  show  he's trying  did he actually  say he made 
[00:13:30]  plans to be  buried with  slaves  that's how  sorry he is  yeah  like like  black people  want him  buried with  slaves  it's  he's ridiculous  he has no  clue  and he finally  realizes he's  not a black  man  what does that  mean  I don't know  but he said  it  what he thought  he could say  the word  because he  thought he  might have  a little  black blood  in him  I don't know  what the context  was  maybe we'll  find out  yeah I think  he thought  he had a good  relationship  with the black  community  right  well this was 
[00:14:00]  all on  Sean Hannity's  show yesterday  we got some  of the highlights  we're gonna get  it on after the  break  but yeah  the big highlight  he wants to be  buried with slaves  that's how sorry  he is for using  the n-word  right  and they  canceled the show  and it's called  the reality show  I mean isn't this  reality  yeah  he should have  done it  on the show  though  instead of  in his  like house  I don't understand  any of these logic  there's got to be a way  to spin this  and go look  this is a reality  show  you know  and sometimes 
[00:14:30]  reality is a bit  on the ugly side  because the ratings  for the show  now  I barely watch  the show  I care less  but now  after knowing  what I know  I would definitely  check out  Dog the Bounty  Hunter  and see if he  brings up  any words  see if he arrests  black people  differently  right  they did actually  cancel it  it's  yeah  they said  it's canceled  indefinitely  yeah  which means  canceled  but then  don't call it  a reality show  because reality  is not just  nice reality  reality is  you know  it runs the gamut 
[00:15:00]  they don't want  somebody  it should show  the ugly side  of human nature  if you're going  to call yourself  a reality show  so is this  the next version  of the white guy  apology tour  yeah  it's amazing  it just gears up  and heads to a city  near you  white person  will say something  stupid  grovel  and nothing will matter  white dummy  in front of a camera  but he actually said  he's so sorry  that he made arrangements  to be buried  with slaves  yeah  how effed up  is this guy  the boys are in the  other room  just cutting this up  laughing their asses off 
[00:15:30]  they're like  this guy's insane  he's not  he's a crazy man  he's crazy  he's just  it's the only gig  he's ever going to get  though  what is he going to  parlay this into  I know  he actually got lucky  doing what he does  and being successful  on a television show  now what  he's in Hawaii  doing a reality show  and there's nowhere  to go from here  no  of course not  that was everything  for him  Paul Farmerdale  what's up  hey good morning guys  how you doing  pretty good Paul  what do you got  I am going to  I don't know  how much I can say  wait wait 
[00:16:00]  let Anthony  Anthony's really good  at this stuff  sometimes  sometimes you got to  like tag Anthony  and go  Anthony help me out  alright  that's what the listeners  need to do  because Anthony  can describe anything  and keep it  within the FCC guidelines  I try  I'm going to use  oldie time terms  ok  he wants to wake  his wife up  with her marital aid  ah  ah  a marital aid  ah  which is a  device  that is used  by some  women 
[00:16:30]  and in the  old days  I guess  it was considered  an aid  to marriage  when the  guy wasn't  home a lot  perhaps he was  out on business  oh  or at the office  a little too long  and she would use  this marital aid  to  help herself out  and now he wants  to wake her up  with that  did you want to  continue explaining  ah  because sometimes  I say marital aid  sometimes  and people go  what is that  are you kidding 
[00:17:00]  I'm not kidding  I would think  last time I said  marital aid  people were like  what the hell  is that  so now I explained  what marital aid  is  it's not our  counselor  it's not our  marriage counselor  right  alright here we go  Paul let's see  good one  you have to go  into the other  room  alright the guy  with the super  soaker was really  good but unfortunately  his wife cursed  so not much of  that made the radio  on this side  anyway  alright here we go  Paul  alright  okay  here we go  alright

[00:20:30]  a thing  a thing  Jimmy hates  Tim's promos  where he uses  those cartoon  voices  I like the  production value  it's not Tim's  work it's just  whatever  what's coming  out of Tim's  mouth  his voice  it's that  sound  that grating  the voice  I don't know  where he got  that  it's like being  physically  assaulted  yeah  it's awful  it's a group  of people  that live  in his head  and they  like discuss  things  they're like  they're like  gossip people 
[00:21:00]  yeah  they're like  hen pecked  like a bunch  of hens  and a quilting  bee  maybe he's  got cancer  he doesn't  have cancer  does he  you know  those voices  that Tim does  and Jimmy  hates it  now Jimmy's  got a problem  here because  now Tim's  using those  voices to  promote your  gig at  Caroline's  this Friday  night  yeah it  really is  like a  beautiful woman  agreeing to  sleep with  you and  then just  kicking you  in the  groin 
[00:21:30]  well this  is what  Timmy came  up with  this is  gonna annoy  the hell  out of  you  Jimmy  I know  it is  it's  Jim Norton  little  Jimmy  Norton  on the  Opie and  Anthony  show  this Friday  7 o'clock  I'll be at  Caroline's  doing a  free show  it's  Jimmy  Norton  Jim  Norton  bring your  MySpace  profile  and you  get in  for free  it's  Jim  Norton  HBO is  giving away  copies of  my DVD  all for  free  dirty  whore 
[00:22:00]  we love  Jim  Norton  it's  Friday  night  7 o'clock  free show  Carol  Friday night  in Caroline's  that might be a  complete rumor  Jim Norton  on the  Opie and  Anthony  show  do you still  hate it  Jimmy  I don't want  to promote  myself  it's like  being punched  in the mouth  well I think  he went over  the top  with that  just to  get to  you  that was  absolutely  done  to get  to you  Jimmy  I knew  something  was gonna  be awful 
[00:22:30]  because Tim  was too  happy  when he  walked in  Jimmy  Norton  it's  horrible  it really  is bad  just meant  to assault  Jimmy's ears  I like when  he does it  regularly  but I think  he just  gave you  a little  extra  there  Jimmy  to get  on your  nerves  a little  over the  top  sure  we got  lots  going on  today  this fact  really bummed  me out  when I read  it this  morning  2007  is already  the deadliest  year for  US troops  in Iraq  yeah  you know  you kind  of feel  like 
[00:23:00]  maybe it's  getting a  little better  over there  but it's  not  no  you know  our boys  are still  dying in  record numbers  obviously  it was  it was  really bad  at the  beginning  of the  year  that's  where a  lot of  the numbers  came from  it sort  of has  kind of  gotten  a little  better  but  it's  leveling  off  a little  bit  hopefully  a little  bit  hopefully  getting better  every day  better  every day  I hope  so  but  remember  when Radiohead  put out  their album  and the  fans  decide  if they 
[00:23:30]  want to  buy it  or not  and how  much  they wanted  to pay  for it  it turns  out 62%  of the fans  who downloaded  the new  Radiohead album  didn't pay  for it  and then the  people that  did pay  for it  the price  was like  $6  I'll pay  $6  I think  $6  is well  worth it  so I don't  know if it  was a  success  or not  did it  sell  more  than it  would  have  I don't  know  we gotta  get a  music  expert  on that  probably  not  but  did they  make  more  than they 
[00:24:00]  would  have  with  the  record  company  out  of  the  mix  I'm  going to  say  they  made  way  more  money  even  though  it  was  only  $6  per  per  lie  on the  average  I'm  sure  a lot  of  Radiohead  fans  paid  a lot  more  because  they're  hardcore  and  others  probably  said  I'll  give  them  a  dollar  but  it  averaged  out  to  $6  a disc  they're  going to  wind up  just  charging  I bet  you  but  $3  or $4  which is  fine  if you  can't  pay $4  you just  shouldn't  have it  yeah  well it's  one of  those deals  though  where  a lot  of  people  are  going to  look at  it  like 
[00:24:30]  the  free  download  you know  not  pay  for  it  I  think  that  will  happen  and it  doesn't  matter  as long  as  they're  making  more  money  than  they  would  if  they  went  through  a  record  company  well it's  almost like  through iTunes  and stuff  a lot of times  you just want to  grab one song  it's a dollar  two songs  or $2  so if it's  $4  people will  pay the extra  just get the  whole record  but a lot of  times iTunes  is great  because the  record sucks  except for  two songs  I think this  was a success  for them  I'm going to  say  maybe we  could get  more info  on that  and speaking  of music  really fast  the Eagles  I saw 
[00:25:00]  this on  TV  this amazes  me  they're promoting  a new album  right  and I'm  thinking  greatest hits  of the  greatest hits  because they've  already done  the greatest hits  thing  I love when  bands put out  more than  one greatest  hits CD  it's like  wait a minute  if it was  the greatest  hits  why do you  have a  second collection  of greatest  hits  or the  ultimate  greatest hits  of the  greatest hits  of the  greatest hits  it's the  bands that  put out  greatest hits  albums  without any  other albums  between the  greatest hits  albums  that could be  a fun little 
[00:25:30]  side thing  we do today  you know  some of  those bands  out there  give me their  collection of  greatest hits  the bands  that put out  more than  one  because they'll  start with  greatest hits  volume one  greatest hits  volume two  the ultimate  greatest hits  actually the  Doors  because I'm  walking around  the city  and they got  posters for a  new Doors  greatest hits  album  and I know  they've had  at least four  or five  well  at least four  or five  greatest hits  albums  I haven't  really put  out anything  new  but shouldn't  the greatest  hits just be  that greatest  hits  that's it 
[00:26:00]  yeah  we're done  with our  creativity  here it is  the greatest  hits of our  career  because these  were the  greatest  they start  kind of  slacking  after a while  the greatest  hits aren't  quite the  greatest hits  and stop  adding that  stupid new  song at the  end of your  greatest hits  album  no one wants  no one wants  to hear it  or the live  track  sometimes  the live  track  I don't  mind  because at  least you  know the  song  you know  you get  this great  CD  it's like  all the  songs you  know and  love from  your favorite  band  and then the  last two  songs are  new songs  it's like  no I don't  want to hear  the new  stuff  sorry  don't try 
[00:26:30]  to package  it in  with your  greatest hits  the Eagles  wound up  selling something  like 750  three quarters  of a million  so yeah  when I heard  the Eagles  had a new  CD  and I saw  the commercials  on TV  with another  greatest hits  type album  well it's  called  Long Road  Out of Eden  it's the  number one  album in  America  it's new  music  and it  sold 711  copies  this week  711 copies  711 thousand  copies  sorry  that would  be really  the record 
[00:27:00]  business is  in trouble  the beauty  was that  it wasn't  700  it was  711  like the  Eagles  so wanted  to put a  spin on  a bad  sale  right  right  that extra  11  they were  adding them  up on the  way over  trying to  sell some  but people  want to  hear  Eagles  new  music  that  bad  711  thousand  copies  I know  they've  been  touring  like  crazy  for the  last few  years  just playing  their old  hits  but  they broke  up for how  long  oh man  they were  gone for a  while  but they've  been back  for a while  now  so  yeah  sorry  I was  distracted  by watching  Jill  Nicolini  stepping on  grapes 
[00:27:30]  oh really  just hoping  she falls  over  and goes  ow  ow  ow  ow  so long  form on  that  yeah  they're doing  the old  step on  the grapes  on TV  in New York  today  and of course  it reminds us  of the famous  news clip  we'll get that  on for you  in a couple  minutes  so that was  kind of  interesting  the Eagles  711  thousand copies  for new  music  all right  hey  only sold  at Walmart  is that true  they're only  selling it  at Walmart  and they  sold that  much  well maybe  Walmart  for exclusivity  must be 
[00:28:00]  pushing it  well they  definitely  know where  their target  audience is  too  yeah  at Walmart  I guess  number two  album was  Britney  yeah  with 250  thousand  something like  that  big drop  off from  first to  second  but the  fact that  she's number  two  is amazing  because that  wasn't even  her  well she's got  so much  exposure right  now  I guess it  really does  mean like  no matter  what you're  doing  if people  are talking  about you  it's good  yeah  of course  of course  it is  controversy  sells  we've made 
[00:28:30]  a living  off that  with this  radio show  I think  it was  Family Guy  I was  watching  the other  day  and they  had like  a little  Britney  segment  and she's  holding her  kid  and she's  on the  phone  smoking a  cigarette  and she  takes her  thumb  and pushes  the soft  spot of  the kid's  head in  to make  an indentation  and uses  it as an  ashtray  and she's  on the  phone  and then  she gets  done with  the phone  conversation  and just  drops the  kid on the  floor  and walks  away  this was  Family Guy  yeah  Bravo  it was really  good  but see  you can do  that stuff  because you 
[00:29:00]  know  it's a  cartoon  but if  it's in  cartoon  form  you're  safe  that's  a tough  one to  pull off  though  in real  life  I'm just  saying  disgusting  that  people go  did you  hear  Opie and  Anthony  this morning  and what  they suggested  Britney  should do  when she  smokes a  cigarette  if you  were listening  to the  shock  chocks  the shock  chocks  are at  it again  they want  to push  in baby  soft  spots 
[00:29:30]  say we  got the  exclusive  audio  they edit  out the  good  part  yeah  the part  where I  was talking  about  Family Guy  and just  leave the  guilty  part in  yeah  we know  how you  work  news  stupid  news  we're on  news  hey  dog the  bounty hunter  so he  was on  our pal  Hannity's  radio show  yeah  dog screwed  up  and he also  did Hannity  and co  on tv  dog asked  for forgiveness  this guy  is a  cuckoo  all white 
[00:30:00]  people on  the apology  tour  just look  silly  if you're  white  and you  screw up  you say  something  a little  racial  you can't  go on  tv shows  all over  the place  and start  apologizing  I hear he's  doing Larry  King  tonight  tonight  I can't  wait  I already  DVR'd that  one  I'm in  I am so  in  I am so  into  that one  what do you  got over  there  oh not  that I  was just  I'm very  psyched about 
[00:30:30]  the Larry  King  thing  so how  important  is the  it was  pretty  important  the dog  so what  did you  say  would you  ever goof  on the  or the  or the  or the  you consider  yourself a  black man  you want to  be buried  in a  slaves  a cemetery  what would  your tombstone  say  here lies  a  hater  well you 
[00:31:00]  gotta hear  this guy  we gotta  get into  this a  little bit  Larry  stand by  okay  right  dog explains  that he  now knows  what we  means  and says  he will  try not  to say  the n  word  again  try  listen  to this  good luck  I use  the word  my  little  baby  is  eight  and she  came to  me and  said dad  we don't  say that  and a lot  of times  liar  you know 
[00:31:30]  what  I got  goosebumps  is he  moving you  that much  is there  a personal  lie that  is believing  this  I think  that that  kid walked  in there  and dog  had an  epiphany  the youngster  straightened  him out  see it's  the children  the innocent  that will  teach us  shut up  I think  his child  that was  probably  one of the  first ten  words he  used  probably  look he  said it 
[00:32:00]  honey  all proud  kissed his  cheek  you know  the white  man is  embarrassing  all of  us  who is  buying  this  crap  dog  just go  away  don't try  to talk  ghetto  it doesn't  sound  good  oh  sorry  got the  subject  the kid  actually came  up to him  and said  daddy we  don't use  that word  daddy we  don't use  that word  where would  an eight  year old  growing up  in a house  that just  probably throws  it around  like the  come up  all of a sudden  and say  daddy we  don't use 
[00:32:30]  that word  that's why  african-american  the kid  meant  exactly  probably meant  the word  equal  come up  with a few  examples  yourself  out there  what is the  kid talking  about here  i use  the word  my  little  baby  is  eight  and she  came to  me and  said dad  we don't  say that  and a lot  of times  a boxer's  in the ring 
[00:33:00]  and he  does a good  job  and the  interview  right after  he says  we knocked  him out  and i always  think what  do you mean  we you just  was in there  by yourself  i know what  we means  now  you and the  eight-year-old  knock someone  out what  does that  mean  what does  it mean  he's making  no sense  all right  so he's  dropping  n-bombs  on the phone  he gets  caught  and he  learns what  we means  more than  one person  i'd love to  see a lesson  well learned  and this  little eight-year-old  is trotting  in teaching  him lessons  stupid kid  daddy get a 
[00:33:30]  haircut you  look like an  idiot  dad you look  like one of  the way  outs  what word  is that  honey  mullet  we don't  use the  word mullet  and gun  on a felon  we don't  use that  either  and how  about fat  wife  we don't  use that  word around  the house  new season  those are  words we  don't use  box set  other words  eating  yeah i think  the kid would  have told him  daddy there's  not a person  alive that has  the same 
[00:34:00]  haircut as  you  what are you  doing  the way  outs  wow  jimmy  i say  wow to  that one  today  i've used  the word  for a long  time not  to mean  what it  does to a  lot of  black people  that are  offended  i will try  never ever  ever to use  that word  again  oh my god  try at least  he said try  most people  say i will  never use that  word again  i'll try  unless you  know some  comes up to  me wants to  give me some 
[00:34:30]  i'll call him  i bet you  he used the  word  after he  left the  studio  of course  he did  stop  didn't we  learn from  imus  that ought to  hold those  for a while  that's exactly  what he did  that's rough  yeah  before we  said look i  promised to  never ever  use that  word again  unless of course  i'm watching a  sporting event  and i have  money on the  game and it's  acceptable  i love this  guy  stop with the  apology tour  it doesn't  work  no one's 
[00:35:00]  believing you  everyone knows  you're just  trying to save  your tv show  makes you look  silly sometimes  you just got to  realize there's  nothing you can  do to save it  you're done  i uh i see this  playing out um  like this i say  the dog takes  that mullet of  his wraps it  around his neck  and hangs  himself wow  imagine him  hanging himself  by his own  mullet this  guy is done  maybe he'll cut  his mullet off  to show that  he's a good  person and  donate it  like you know  they've cancer  hospitals and you  donate your  hair  that's good  then he'll 
[00:35:30]  donate his  and no one  will want it  no one will  want the dog's  hair  no one  all right  here we  leaf garrett  in the late  70s  will take the  back part of  it and the  front part  you just  throw out  uh here's uh  more dog from  hannity  and combs  i thought that  i was cool  enough in the  black world to  be able to use  that word  now that's  something i can  relate to anthony  i can't because  um where is this  black world  is it a 
[00:36:00]  doppelganger earth  on the other  side of the  sun  on the black  world  half the moon  i guess pink  floyd sang about  it  i uh i can  relate to that  statement  well yes you  you did something  you had a little  racial faux pas  well as you were  growing up  i was 15 at the  time and you do  think if you're  hanging out with a  lot of black  people that you  could kind of talk  their language  no you don't  and you and if 
[00:36:30]  you're like me you  learn the hard way  when you're knocked  out cold on a  basketball court with  a chipped tooth that  maybe you're not  allowed to say that  word you shouldn't  say it even if you  if you meant no harm  by saying it even  though uh you used  it to tell the kid  that he uh he uh  just shot a really  nice three pointer  doesn't matter  does not matter  i uh i i went to  um central islip  uh public schools  yeah  growing up at one  point when we had  to move every six  months because uh dad 
[00:37:00]  couldn't keep a  vending machine job  thanks  well because daddy  was an alcoholic  well of course he  was  yeah  and uh you know  if he didn't uh  if he didn't steal  enough change from  the vending machines  that month  uh we had to move  so uh we went to  the uh beautiful  central islip  which uh  around the country  if you want to  know what  central islip is like  just look for a  neighborhood that  has the intersection  of mlk and  malcolm x boulevard  there you got in  your head that's  where i lived  and uh i never 
[00:37:30]  once thought i  could ever use  that word in any  context whatsoever  so i didn't  there were kids  that would come up  and go give me  give me 50 cent  and and you gave  him 50 cent  yeah i think uh  the difference i uh  i was brought up  a way way more  naive than you  yeah  you like understood  the community  oh you should have  my parents then  for a little while  right i understood  the community  at six months old  okay  i didn't 
[00:38:00]  subliminally i think  i didn't have any  i was being force fed  i didn't have any  interaction with uh  with uh  um  uh  with african americans  no  until i was in junior  high i had no clue  what they were about  until junior high  really  i'd i'd i'd see you  know african americans  and whatever  they just look different  to me i didn't know  i didn't know any  better  they were just called  black people back  sure black people  so afro-american 
[00:38:30]  so i i didn't have  any interaction with  them uh with them  until i was in junior  high  yeah  and then i i made a  lot of friends because  i played a lot of  basketball and uh  you know the legendary  story this was in high  school now when i was  like uh  did they call you the  white shadow  white shadow  little ken howard  young opie growing up  i'm on hair  i believe i  i believe i actually  was 16 and we were  playing a pickup game  and i i was pretty much  the only white kid on  the court maybe one  other maybe two  tops  then you were picking  up your teeth which  is oh yeah  and then my teammate  my teammate had 
[00:39:00]  sorry the image is  great  my team  my teammate had a  fine three-pointer  swish  mm-hmm  he shot a  he was gay too  huh  oh  sorry  i misunderstand  sports lingo  and i turned to him  and i said nice shot  because everyone else  was saying exactly that  on the basketball court  as we're running up  and down  and before the word  uh completely left my  mouth i was uh i was  on the basketball uh  court  fell  the rest of his 
[00:39:30]  friends said the  same thing  nice shot  and everything was  fine  and then it was  awkward and then i  had to kind of maybe  uh leave the game  uh because yeah i was  in no shape to  continue playing  did you continue with  the friendship or  yeah actually i did  really did you ever  talk about it did you  ever say why did you  punch me in the face  yeah  no it was uh it was  understood  immediately  why would you be  friends with that  douche after he slugged  you when he knew you  didn't mean anything  it wasn't like we  were it wasn't like  we were friends like  going over to each  other's house but 
[00:40:00]  because i played a  lot of basketball we  ran in the same  circle so it was it  was a little weird  after that but it  was all right did  you ever apologize  for punching you in  the face instead of  going hey no  shouldn't be  you were right  apology so here we  go so as we uh  listen to this clip i  kind of understand  from my youth what  this is about  i thought that i was  cool enough in the  black world to be  able to use that  word as a brother  to a brother i'm 
[00:40:30]  not i've always  taken pride to be  the white guy that  can talk to the  black people that  can refer to them  truly as a brother  from a different  mother  but this is america  and this is  entertainment and  that doesn't fly  there  wow  the brother from  another mother  yo  wow  how embarrassing  is this  word to your  mullet 
[00:41:00]  this is  this is  this is  awful  how embarrassing  is this  he is a babbling  like just  idiot  i can't even think  of a good enough  word  who's gonna go to  jail with you now  if you pull them  over  who  shut up  just drive away  over that  yeah  instead of saying  my kid should be  shot because he's  a drug addict who  recorded his father  and sold it to the  inquirer 
[00:41:30]  yeah  father's a boob  but the kid sucks  too  yep  well when we get  back uh we got him  talking about how he  wants to be buried  with slaves that's how  sorry he is  uh we got the  official apology  uh dog talks about  visiting george  washington's house and  seeing where the  slaves were buried  visiting george  washington's house  this guy doesn't  know what to do  he is  i i would love to  see the meeting  that he had with  other people to  pitch ideas on how  to salvage this 
[00:42:00]  all right  uh george washington's  house uh bury me  with the slaves  uh i'm gonna talk  about how i was a  brother from another  mother  guy's an idiot  he's just doing  anything that he  thinks can ask him  to eat collard greens  all right good good  good good  all the collard greens  what else  yeah we know a  little bit about this  when you mess up  uh you go into  damage control uh  mode yeah  and then they start  suggesting just  crazy whacked out  things to try to get  you out of the  uh situation you're  in the dog wants  black people to  throw pies at his  face  well for years

Also talking about greatest hits CDs.  And Kiss is guilty.  Kiss.  Steve came in with their discography. 
[00:46:00]  And in 28 years, they've had seven greatest hits CDs.  And there's one they don't even list on here, which is an album I had.  It's called Kiss the Originals.  Which is, it was Kiss, Dressed to Kill, and Hotter Than Hell.  Their first three albums just put in a three-album package.  I don't know, that's not a greatest hits, but it's just a repackaging.  Yeah.  So technically, eight in 28 years.  I just find it funny when your favorite band puts out greatest hits after greatest hits after greatest hits.  It should be one, maybe two.  Maybe two. 
[00:46:30]  Black Sabbath's had a few, too.  But a couple of them were bootlegs, so I really don't count them.  I think they themselves would put out two or three, but I mean, they've had a lot of bootlegs.  I love what people give them to me.  I don't have them.  What, is Warpigs on here?  Well, some of these bands are just repackaging the same old crap over and over again, just  changing the name of the album and changing some of the greatest hits out.  You know, like dropping a couple, adding a couple that they didn't have.  Well, anyway, with Kiss, you had Double Platinum, 1978, was the first greatest hits?  Well, again, the originals was in the mid-70s, but 78 might have been the first.  All right, so their first greatest hits was called Double Platinum. 
[00:47:00]  Then they went with Killers in 1982.  Then they went with Smashes, Thrashes, and Hits in 1988.  I don't like that title.  And then they went with You Wanted the Best, You Got the Best in 1996.  I remember that one.  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of the tagline that they use.  Exactly.  And then a mere year later.  I'm the best who got mediocrity.  No.  I resent that.  Sorry, Jimmy.  A mere year later, they went with Greatest Kiss. 
[00:47:30]  Ah, see, because.  And then after having all those Greatest Hit CDs out, they went with a box set in 2002.  You got to go with the box set.  And then 2002 also brought you the very best of Kiss.  The very, very best.  Proving my point that we made about a half hour ago.  How ridiculous that is.  And Kiss is a great band, Jimmy.  I wouldn't argue that with you.  It is amazing, though, how many, how, like, the artists, and I'm not saying they're wrong  to want their cut, believe me, like on iTunes and stuff, but it's amazing how they complained 
[00:48:00]  that people were stealing from Napster.  And I bought the same songs.  Yeah.  Nine times.  There used to be, back in the day when we were all growing up, you had your favorite band,  their creativity ran out, then they went with their Greatest Hit CD, then they went with  a live CD, and then they were finished.  So long.  Done.  Retirement.  That usually was how bands would, that was their lifespan. 
[00:48:30]  That was their lifespan.  There you go.  You know what else they're doing?  Goddamn DVDs of TV shows.  And I think one of the biggest criminals, as far as this is concerned, is Seinfeld.  And I love Seinfeld.  I wouldn't miss an episode.  I've seen him a thousand times.  I'll still laugh my ass off.  But they made a huge to-do, if I may say to-do, when they would put out season one, season  two, season three. 
[00:49:00]  A few months later, and then during Christmas, they put out another season and put out all  the seasons.  And then I find out that they just put out the entire show in a box set.  So now you've got to buy that if you missed a few of the seasons.  Like, I didn't buy all the seasons.  I kind of slowed down.  And I was going to pick them up, but didn't.  And now I've got to buy, like, the whole box set.  That's what I have on.  Go back and get them.  It's not like they take them off the market. 
[00:49:30]  You can just go to the store today.  Yeah, but I'd rather just have one box set than 80 boxes of discs.  You're more of a collector.  I could care less as long as I have all the seasons.  No, it's a big difference.  Believe me, because I bought Star Trek, the original Star Trek, when they put out, like,  one episode per disc.  I had hundreds of discs in my closet of stupid Star Trek.  And then they put out the entire series on a box set that was, you know, nothing. 
[00:50:00]  It was, like, about five CD cases stacked up on top of each other.  That's how big it was.  So then you could make some room in your house, throw out all the Star Trek.  That's what it is.  Single DVDs and go with the box set or whatever.  They make the initial seasons, they put them in big boxes so they take up a lot of room.  And then they put out the box set of the entire series, and it's worth it just for space  to get that and get rid of the other ones.  Yeah.  They know what they're doing.  All right.  Hey, someone wants to defend Kiss.  And like you said, you wind up buying the same things two or three times. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I don't think we were trashing Kiss.  Tom, go ahead.  I was.  Sorry.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I love yous all.  Love you, Jimmy Norton.  You guys are awesome.  But, you know, some of the stuff they've put out has had extra songs on it, live versions.  And a lot of times it's the record company that puts the stuff out.  That's true.  And they don't even have anything to do with it.  No, you're right, dude.  And I'm sorry to interrupt you, but it's funny.  Double Platinum, I remember.  The big addition to that was they redid Strutter, and they called it Strutter 78, which was just  like they just re-sang the same song. 
[00:51:00]  But you're right.  It is the album.  The record company is more than the band.  And it's a band that's still trying to put out new music.  I want to look at the Doors.  The Doors are really guilty of putting out a lot of greatest hits albums and CDs and stuff,  even though Jim's been dead for, what, 30 years?  30 some odd years.  You know, with Kiss, you also got to look at him as it's, that's the epitome of a band  that's going to just squeeze the money out of the band.  You know, with Gene in there, I'm sure he thought greatest hits CDs were fantastic. 
[00:51:30]  Like, we could package it without having to do anything else, really, and make money off  of it.  That's Gene all over.  One thing I'll say about Kiss, though, is that when they put something out, you always  feel like you're getting something really good.  Like, they never package things crappy, which I kind of like.  They just package things really nicely.  And speaking of Kiss and greatest hits CDs, this is a song that was on one of the greatest  hits CDs.  I bet you don't know this, Jimmy.  I bet you don't know this, Jimmy. 
[00:52:00]  We're back, back in the New York groove.  We're back, back in the New York groove.  Like Jimmy's version.  Welcome back to the OBN Anthony Show.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  To understand the beauty of that, and if you want the rest of the song, you're going 
[00:52:30]  to have to pick up one of the Kiss greatest hits CDs to get the whole version, but to understand  the beauty of that, we didn't just throw drums behind Jimmy's singing.  Jimmy was actually playing the drum.  Of course.  Vanilla Fudge, because the radio chick, when she was on the afternoons, was dating Carmine  of Peace, who was a drummer, a legendary drummer, and his drum set was in studio.  I guess they were going to do some drumming, and I decided to play on the great Carmine  of Peace's drums.  Yeah.  And I'm good.  And just improvise New York groove. 
[00:53:00]  So there you go.  Hey, Joe Flushing, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm a big Stones fan, but they've got a myriad of live albums, greatest hits.  They've got eight of them.  Eight greatest hits CDs.  Yeah, they've got High Tide and Green Grass, Through the Pairs Darkly, Hot Rocks, More  Hot Rocks.  High Tides and Green Grass?  Made in the Shade, Sucking in the 70s, Forty Licks, and a new latest one is called Jump  Back.  We got that one.  We remember that.  Well, let me ask you a question, because the Stones do have, I'll say this, they have 
[00:53:30]  more of a history, I mean, what, since 62, I'm going to think.  Right.  How many of those songs are repeated?  Do they have, like, the greatest hits, like, from the previous five years, or do they go all  the way back and every one of them has satisfaction on it?  Yeah.  Well, a lot of these albums have several songs, you know, on every album, the same  songs, you know, Honky Tonk Woman, Satisfaction, Brown Sugar, they're on, like, most of these  albums.  I would argue that the Rolling Stones have enough material to put out eight greatest  hits CDs, though.  They are just a monster band.  They just hit after hit after hit, decade after decade. 
[00:54:00]  But shouldn't you only, as a band, be allowed one greatest hits?  Like, these are your greatest hits.  Greatest means greatest.  After that, what are you going to go, no, no, those suck.  Look, these are the greatest.  These, my friend.  These are the greatest.  And then bands, and then when they put out enough greatest hit CDs, bands are guilty of  doing, like, band favorites.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  So they're kind of greatest hits, but there are also some other interesting songs that  might not have got Radio Airplay or made a greatest hit CD. 
[00:54:30]  Besides.  A lot of these songs are on every album.  Yeah.  They drag the ones from the 60s up until the 90s, you know?  Right.  So, I mean, there are several newer ones as the years went by, but a lot of them are  just the same, Jumpin' Jack Flash and stuff like that.  All right, Joe.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Have a good day.  Thanks for listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's get back to Dog the Bounty Hunter on Hannity and Co.  Great.  Speaking of greatest hits.  Yeah.  Where were we?  We got the greatest hits of his apology tour. 
[00:55:00]  Dog is on Hannity and Combs last night.  He's going to be on Larry King tonight, and he's just groveling and just looking like an  idiot.  He really is just looking like an idiot.  Just shut your mouth and hope for the best.  None of this is going to work for you.  When I mis-apologize, we're like, ah, come on, don't apologize.  All right, whatever.  But at least I mis-I didn't wish he didn't have to, but he kept his dignity.  He was still-he was just a subdued island.  But this is-I thought I was one of the brothers.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, we play that before the brace.  He thought he could use the word because he thought he was one of them. 
[00:55:30]  Brother from another mother, he actually said.  He actually said that.  Getting choked up.  He said, Dog thought he was cool enough to use the N-word.  Here we go.  Here's the next clip.  Talking about his son, Tucker, right?  Yeah.  His son started this whole-  I was going to say, you've got to be like Quentin Tarantino to be cool enough to say that.  Exactly.  And you've got to be in a movie at the time.  Does it say, dead son's girlfriend drop off to this set anyway?  But his son started the controversy by taping the conversation he was having with Dog about his black girlfriend. 
[00:56:00]  Here we go.  Here's where Tucker comes in.  I was in prison in Texas Department of Corrections.  I named Tucker, Tucker D. Chapman, TDC.  Because in my life, I had to have something take over that TDC, Tucker, or Texas Department of Corrections.  So I thought, this is the son that I will have, that I will be a good guy for and never go back to prison.  I couldn't name him prison, but it was kind of like naming there's a song with Johnny Cash, you name your boy Sue. 
[00:56:30]  It was kind of like that I was in back then when he was born.  What is he talking about?  He really is a moron.  I couldn't name him prison.  I couldn't name him prison.  Could I?  Could I have named him prison?  Oh, geez.  Should have named him prison.  How about Sodomy Junior?  That would have been a nice name.  And Hannity was just sitting there last night going, I got gold.  Yeah, this is great.  Hannity didn't need to talk.  Just let this guy continue just babbling about nonsense. 
[00:57:00]  What adult.  So the kid's initials equaled the Texas Department of Corrections.  Right.  So he was then able to look at the kid.  I don't even know what he's saying.  This is my son in prison, and this is my daughter, black fist in my face.  And this is my other daughter, dirtbag guard.  And a snitch with a throat cut, my other nephew.  Don't forget Shank.  Here comes lousy screw.  Yeah.  Come here.  Man, I got a lousy screw. 
[00:57:30]  All right, more on Tucker and why he did this.  Or maybe we don't get the answer.  Okay, and how much did they pay your son for this?  Well, I think they gave him $15,000.  That's a legend rumor.  Righteous bugs.  Why did your son do this to you?  You know, I don't know.  I mean, I guess I would say I've been to prison, and I wouldn't do this to my father.  I don't know why he would do it unless, you know, there's some kind of habit or something he needs the money for.  Habit, shrugs?  Drugs.  Well, absolutely, drugs.  That's the reason I went to prison in the beginning. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's kind of like, hey, he's on drugs.  I'm such a great dad that no one would do this just out of, you know, the fact that he bashed the girlfriend.  Oh, my son.  Well, you know, he needed the money for dope.  Wow.  I don't see the holiday season being very festive at Dog's house.  It's going to be very awkward.  Yeah.  I don't see the gifts being exchanged between him and Tucker.  We're talking about Thanksgiving at Thans? 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Oh, sorry, Thans.  So, Dog and Tucker or Than and Mother?  Who do you think has a worse relationship?  I would have to go with Than and Mother.  Than and Mother?  How's Mother, Than?  Than, what do you think?  Well, it sounds like at least they talk.  Well, yes.  Or did.  It's true.  You guys don't even have the opportunity to tape each other, so.  No.  And there could be tape.  She's not a public figure, so. 
[00:59:00]  Right, right.  We hold her to the same standard.  And the way he refers to his son's girlfriend is the way Mother refers to family.  Yes.  Do we have a Mother update?  No.  Thanksgiving.  Coming up.  Getting there.  Will you be in the same place as Mother?  No, I decided this would be the first year that I actually go to my girlfriend's family.  I'm going to try a new family.  You're just going to try honing in on a new family there. 
[00:59:30]  That's good.  I'm going to the bullpen for a relief family.  That works.  A relief family.  Yeah.  That's pretty fun.  That works.  All right.  Kind of cool.  Yeah.  I'm sure my brother and his new nephew will understand.  Oof.  Yeah.  You know what that means?  Yeah, see the other family.  That means you guys got to do.  What?  Did you push the fear out, Jimmy?  No, I did not.  Oh, no.  Someone pushed the fear out.  Oh, that means God.  Yes, sir.  Uh, Patrick Duffy.  Oh, my God.  Just stop me in my tracks.  Did you? 
[01:00:00]  No.  Iraq.  Iraq.  You pushed the fear out this morning?  Someone did.  Who pushed the fear out?  You, Jimmy?  No, no.  I promise you.  I'll tell you.  It wasn't me.  No, I think you're actually.  Wasn't me, man.  Maybe it's my food pocket acting off.  Oh, God.  No, you're quite with your own.  Damn food pocket.  Your own dumpster food pocket.  Disgusting.  It's got some rotting sausage and cannoli in it.  I just know that bothers Jimmy.  I love saying food pocket.  No one likes your food pocket.  What I was going to say, that means if you do Thanksgiving with her family, she's got to 
[01:00:30]  do Christmas with your family.  Is that trade-off?  That's when they're going to take notice and go, oh, okay, I see what's going on here.  Who's going to notice?  Mother and everyone else when you don't show up for Christmas either.  Now, what about the rest of the family?  Because this is kind of a sacrifice.  So you get away from mother, but do you have other family that's going to be there that  you would like to see?  Yeah, but also since my parents are divorced, we have mom Christmas and dad Christmas.  Oh.  I'll at least get to attend dad Christmas. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  That's good.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get back to dog.  There's your mother update.  Not much today from fan.  We'll get into that a little deeper on a future Opie and Anthony show.  Here we go.  More Dog the Bounty Hunter on Hannity and Combs.  Well, Dog says he used to use the N-word as a greeting.  Really?  Is this a word you use with regularity throughout the years?  And now only in the last four days I've realized, five days, that it's wrong to use?  I was sitting in a studio when the other person used the word. 
[01:01:30]  But did you use it regularly?  Not that regularly.  Only probably as a greeting to a black person where they'd come up, hi, man, dog.  And I'd be like, stick my head in his chest, hi, man, how are you doing?  I wouldn't turn around and say hi and use it out loud because I'm going to get beat up.  But I used it as a, when I meet a brother and we shake and we say, how's it?  That's how it is.  It's not a degrading thing at all.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't look at other white people. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, Jesus.  No, no.  Jesus.  The, the, he, does he understand the context he used this in on that recording?  Because it has nothing to do with how he's greeting people or it's not a, um, uh, a joke.  It wasn't some kind of, you know, yeah, it was a personal phone call, but it did get out.  And he was using it as, I don't want my son going out with one of them and, uh, you, you  will not be involved in the show if you do.  But to show you where we're at with racial stuff, like the fact that, first of all, it's 
[01:02:30]  not illegal to be racially inappropriate at home.  No, it's not.  Uh, but isn't it funny?  Alec Baldwin says horrific things to his 12 year old and that's like, eh, but this guy,  because he used racial terms, his career is over.  Yeah.  Both in private conversations, both lead to the media.  One is going to survive and continue to thrive and one is finished.  30 Rock, yeah.  Well, I mean, but him is a career upset.  Before the writer's strike.  Don't, don't use racially inappropriate terms. 
[01:03:00]  Well, this is, uh, this next clip is just beautiful.  It's, uh, dog says he, uh, thought he was black too.  I thought he was.  No, he doesn't.  I don't, I don't believe it that happened.  It couldn't be that awful.  He is desperate.  You said you, you, this is how you would greet, you told me privately Snoop Dogg.  Is that true?  Yes, exactly right.  I mean, and, but you, I mean, you just can't walk up and say hi, you know, you're getting  hit in the mouth.  But when, when a brother says that to you first, or you realize that there's, there's a special  connection that I thought I had between me and black America. 
[01:03:30]  And I used to say, I'm black too.  In other words, I, my whole life have been called a half breed, a convict, king of the  trailer trash, this and that.  I take that and stand.  So when I stood there and said, I kind of know what you feel like, because I've been there  too, that I felt that I could embrace and like as brothers or even as a black woman,  say the word.  I, you can't, I now learn.  It's like a black woman?  I'm not black at all. 
[01:04:00]  How'd your parents die?  Black people.  It's okay to laugh.  Oh, laugh.  Please laugh.  Please laugh.  Point at the radio.  Point and laugh at the radio and just laugh at stupid whitey.  I now know.  Wow.  He was confused.  Oh my God.  He's just battling.  They call me convict, half breed, half breed.  Half breed for what?  Half breed.  That's pretty white to me.  Of course he does.  Yeah, he's all white. 
[01:04:30]  With that blonde mullet.  What is he?  Half bodybuilder, half wham video.  Half way out.  Go back to the way out.  Do we have a little way out music?  Boy, if you pull that one out of your.  I think, yeah, I think Iraq might have some way outs.  Jimmy pointed out that he might be part of the way outs.  This dog to bounty hunter.  Oh, he's awful.  No.  Look at the pressure.  Look at Iraq under pressure.  Oh, he's awful.  He's great.  I love how he just babbles to himself. 
[01:05:00]  Hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  He's heating up over there.  Ed Norton.  One and a two.  There's a place where I can go.  Oh, yeah.  That's where I want to be.  I'm playing good by you good people.  For I found a place for me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gonna go way out.  Well, that's where the fun is.  Well, that gives a crap.  To the black world. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  That's where they were going.  All right, listen.  After the break, we got the big apology from Dog the Bounty Hunter on Hannity and Combs last night.  It's terrific.  And then finally, we'll get into the part where he talks about how he wants to be buried with slaves.  That's how sorry he is.  Yep.  It's some amazing clips, thanks to Sean Hannity.  All right?  Very good.  All right.  Anything else you want to do before the break?  Hint, hint.  Nudge, nudge.  Wow.  Very slick.  I must have been good.  Very slick.  I must have been good.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm not kidding. 
[01:06:00]  Are you kidding me?  Boy, I really am good.  I thought I had something on you.  Nope.  I was ready to say, wake up and do your job, but you've got to turn around and say, wake up to me.  I'm on the mother.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Clear as a bell.  Mm-hmm.  I got to know when now.  Listen to the replay.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  Tear down a wall for me.  Probably three minutes ago, like right over, it was right after the clip of Dog saying that he was, knew now that he wasn't black. 
[01:06:30]  There was some laughter, and in that laughter, boom.  Are you kidding?  Nope.  All right.  There it was.  I knew that was a good spot.  Look at me, getting a little mad, like, dude, fit the sound in.  No.  See, we can tear down the wall for you here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll continue.  Stay there.  Hey, good morning.  It is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:07:00]  We've got to go right to the phones and get our $1,000 winner for today.  And I'm proud to say Buffalo wins the $1,000 today.  Jessica, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Congratulations.  Thank you so much.  Jessica's listening on the edge, of course, the home of Shred and Reagan, and you won $1,000, Jessica.  Nice.  I'm shaking.  Why are you shaking?  I don't know.  I just can't believe I won.  I heard the sounder, but I didn't call because I just didn't feel like it. 
[01:07:30]  But then when you guys said that people weren't calling.  Oh, right.  What's wrong, Ed?  I don't know.  Her story sounded like it was going to become boring.  She's just explaining how she won her $1,000.  I was calling, made this phone call.  I dialed the phone.  I want you guys to use, I have an idea for another sound.  Okay.  Mo.  I want you guys to use, I don't remember what show it was.  I think it's like CSI or something.  But you guys kept playing those horrible one-liners before the show started.  Oh, when we were making fun of David Caruso. 
[01:08:00]  David Caruso.  Yes.  I guess.  It's kind of old hat now.  Yeah.  Well, we'll think about it, Jessica.  Oh, they're funny.  Let it go, Jessica.  Yeah, let it go.  And by the way, we didn't say no one was calling for the contest.  That makes it sound like no one's listening to our radio show.  You know what I mean.  I basically.  You snuck it in good is what I mean.  All right.  I couldn't believe Anthony was able to sneak the sound past me.  I was amazed by that.  I snuck it in.  All right, Jessica.  Congratulations.  Say hi to Shred and Reagan.  What else we wanted to say to Buffalo today? 
[01:08:30]  How are the Bills doing?  They're doing great.  How about the Sabres?  They're doing horrible.  How about the Canadian Ballet?  Yeah, I don't care.  I don't know about that.  How's Niagara Falls?  Oh, boy.  That's hilarious.  That's hacky Buffalo stuff, Jimmy.  It doesn't match their legitimate question.  I want to know.  Yeah.  There's a problem there.  Buffalo's the only place where, like, any random girl just knows about all the sports  teams.  Huh?  Is that, like, a Buffalo thing?  Buffalo, I would say there are, yeah, there's a lot of women up there that know their sports. 
[01:09:00]  Like, I mean, you know, you ask her about the Bills and stuff, but then the Sabres,  and she knows, ah, they're not doing too well.  Yeah.  It's all-encompassing up there in Buffalo.  They know their sports teams.  Interesting.  But there are chicks that know sports, and then there are Buffalo Bettys that know sports.  You don't really want to hang out with the Buffalo Bettys.  Are you a Buffalo Betty, Jessica?  No, I'm not.  You don't wear the oversized sweatshirt?  Oversized Bill sweatshirt?  Nope.  Over the stretch pants.  Over the stretch pants, and eat a lot of buffalo wings, and bake scrod. 
[01:09:30]  Scrod?  Is that big up there?  Well, actually, it's Fish Fry Fridays.  Couldn't get enough of the fish fry when I was living up there.  Right?  Right, Jessica?  That's right.  See, are we going local today, or what?  Hey, how is that?  With tartar sauce?  Tartar sauce.  I want my fish fry with tartar sauce.  How's the last exit on the thruway?  What was that?  How's Conawanda?  How is it?  I'm kidding.  Yeah, Jimmy's just-  It's a friend named Buffalo Things. 
[01:10:00]  You know where it is, anyway.  Yeah, Jimmy's been up there many times.  Jessica, thank you.  You won the $1,000, okay?  Thank you so much.  How's Marv Levy?  Marv Levy?  Scott Norwood.  Scott Norwood?  My God, just-  Yeah, he's a legend.  All right, hey, Jessica, say hi to Shredder Reagan for us.  We got to go.  All right, bye, guys.  There you go.  Jim Kelly.  Do we have tomorrow sound?  Yes, we do.  Okay.  Here is the sound you'll be listening for tomorrow.  All right. 
[01:10:30]  Between 7 and 7.30 a.m. during our program for your chance to win $1,000.  Here's the sound.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Are you kidding?  Yes.  That's the sound for tomorrow.  Jimmy's favoritest thing he's ever done.  All right, very good.  The shut up sound.  So if you hear, shut up.  Tomorrow, 7, 7.30.  Call in.  All right.  Give you a chance.  Hey, in other news, Kurt Schilling signs the one-year deal with the Red Sox. 
[01:11:00]  This I found very interesting today.  Greg Maddox.  Sports news.  Wins his record 17th Golden Glove.  17?  Jimmy's got a mouthful of eggs.  We were all flabbergasted by that.  Me, not so much.  Yeah.  Isn't he like 45 years old?  He's a pitcher.  I understand that.  So they don't get that many balls hit to them, and they only play once every few games.  So they probably have much fewer chances for errors. 
[01:11:30]  So I don't care about him or his Down Syndrome face.  Wow.  He has a retarded person's mouth, and it makes me sick.  All right.  But it's a great accomplishment.  A little commentary.  Yes.  Give you news and commentary.  And we're also talking about Greatest Hit CDs, and now Kiss is off the hook there, Jimmy.  We're done with Kiss because the Doors are the worst offenders.  Really?  They've had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven box sets.  Oof.  Now, you talk about Greatest Hits, and then when you start talking about box sets, usually 
[01:12:00]  it's like, here's the box set of the Doors, and it has to be everything they ever did.  Yeah.  Not in the Doors case.  They had to put out seven different versions of their box sets.  And nine compilations.  Nine compilations.  Nine Greatest Hit CDs.  They started it off in 1970 with 13.  Wow.  Then they went with Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine in 1972.  Then they went with The Doors' Greatest Hits in 1980.  Followed that up in 1985 with The Best of the Doors. 
[01:12:30]  Then in 2000, they just got nuts.  They went with Essential Rarities.  Then they went with The Best of the Doors.  Then they went with The Very Best of the Doors.  Very best.  Then they went with Legacy, The Absolute Best.  Now, that's The Absolute Best.  You could stop right there, right?  But then they went back to The Very Best of the Doors again.  But didn't they have The Very Best?  Yeah, in 2001, but they redid it in 2007.  So how could that be The Very Best if The Very Best came out and the singer's dead?  I don't know, man. 
[01:13:00]  Can someone please just bypass the record companies?  I want the bands to cut them out so badly.  Well, Radiohead did it.  Started a trend.  Oh, by the way, there was only nine studio albums.  Yeah.  Nine compilations.  Yeah, they had nine greatest hits albums, and they only had nine studio albums.  So why don't you just buy every one of them, and you have every great album.  And then you have everything.  You also have every worst of them.  And how many box sets do they have?  Seven.  They have seven box sets for a band that only put out nine albums.  This is Jim Morrison singing while realizing he's impotent.  How many different versions of stupid backdoor man do we need? 
[01:13:30]  The remaining members of The Doors, they all just suck.  Look, they started finding tapes of just Jim doing poetry.  Oh, let's put music behind this.  Have music behind it.  Sell it as new.  Oh, we got audio of Jim ordering some food at a fast food restaurant.  Well, let's just come up with a groove, and we'll send that out to the people.  Whores, I say.  Whores.  Yes, they are.  You had nothing to do with the success of The Doors.  They own them.  Except for Robbie Krieger, maybe a little bit. 
[01:14:00]  A little bit for Robbie Krieger.  The rest of them, forget about it.  It was all Jim.  Hey, more Dog the Bounty Hunter?  A little bit more.  All right, here we go.  So now we get up to Dog apologizing on Hannity and Combs last night, trying to save his...  What a doodle-y.  His TV career.  Mullet.  Yeah, we'll get into Octopus Baby next there, Jimmy.  He's just bothering everybody, this thing.  Stop showing it like we think it's cute.  All right, here we go. 
[01:14:30]  The Dog apologizes.  Of course, all black people in America, I owe an apology to.  Whether, how dark I think I am, I cannot say that word.  I owe the rest of the people, whether they're black or not in America, an apology because people looked up to me.  I've learned a lesson.  All my lessons I've learned in my life have been the hard way.  I guess I wouldn't learn them.  This is one of the hardest lessons I've ever learned in my life, even facing death. 
[01:15:00]  If I could kill myself and people would forgive me, I would do that.  Uh-huh.  Idea.  Oh, idea for a new TV show.  I dropped the N-bomb.  I should shoot myself.  That's not getting carried away.  No.  A very good solution.  If I could kill myself and be forgiven, he would do that.  Black people, do you hear this?  This could be the greatest moment ever.  Get a petition going.  We forgive.  How bad Whitey has gotten.  How many black people could we get to sign a petition saying that we forgive Dog the Bounty Hunter if he kills himself? 
[01:15:30]  If he kills himself.  Oh, my God.  This is our next bit.  It's staring us right in the face.  That is the most ridiculous statement ever.  He absolutely doesn't mean that.  And a little while ago, I did say that this is going to end with him hanging himself with his own wallet.  So I might not be too far off.  In Caligula, there's a great scene where Caligula's very sick.  And someone's trying to curry favor with Caligula.  And he's kneeling by the bed. 
[01:16:00]  And he goes,  I would gladly give my life if Jupiter would just heal you.  And then the Caligula sat up and went,  Jupiter accepts.  And the guy's like,  Um.  And he took the guy away to kill him.  He accepted for Jupiter.  I love that.  Yeah.  So this is kind of like a moment like that.  Jupiter accepts.  Jupiter accepts.  You forgot that he could be the spokesperson for you.  Wow.  Well, we got to get the black people to start signing a petition, man. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Basically, you have to state that you will accept his apology if he kills himself.  Yeah.  How great is this?  Let's call him out on this.  Let's get this going.  How?  Now, how did Sean Hannity?  Black people, start making your YouTube videos.  I will forgive Dog the Bounty Hunter if he kills himself.  Just kill yourself.  But play the clip first, then show you saying I forgive.  Yeah.  Let's call him out on this.  He said he would gladly.  Wait, I got to hear that again.  Of course, all black people in America, I owe an apology to whether how dark I think 
[01:17:00]  I am.  I cannot say that word.  I owe the rest of the people, whether they're black or not in America, an apology because  people looked up to me.  I've learned a lesson.  All my lessons I've learned in my life have been the hard way.  I guess I wouldn't learn them.  This is one of the hardest lessons I've ever learned in my life, even facing death.  If I could kill myself and people would forgive me, I would do that. 
[01:17:30]  But I said on the way here, I hope no one died thinking I meant that word before I got  here.  He's hoping, yeah, nobody died.  What a pompous ass because people look up to me.  No one's dying with you on their lips.  Yeah.  I can't believe Dog is a racist.  I beg A&E to continue production of Dog.  Oh, please. 
[01:18:00]  I would watch every single episode.  I would buy the box set.  I would study every episode.  The guy's adult.  It's a reality show.  Show the ugly side of reality.  Continue with this thing.  Show this groveling idiot.  Idiot is absolutely right.  People would watch that just to laugh at him.  If black people want retribution for what he said, what is more satisfying than watching  this boob humiliate himself and grovel?  Do you understand?  This is the equivalent of crawling on his hands and knees with a hog in his mouth. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty much what he's doing.  It has begun.  Lewis?  Yeah.  You are a black gentleman, are you?  Yes.  All right.  And you're from the Bronx?  Yes.  Okay.  What do you got?  I will forgive Dog if he hangs himself by his mullet, just like you said.  All right.  We have our first one.  That is the first black man that wants to get in touch with Dog and let Dog know that 
[01:19:00]  he will forgive him if he kills himself, and hopefully by hanging himself with his mullet.  How many black gentlemen do we need to make this happen, you think, Lewis?  I don't know the black community.  I don't know how this stuff works.  How many do we officially need, you think?  Two.  Two.  Two, all right.  We're looking for one more black guy.  I just want to say, I love you guys.  I love the show.  I listen every morning on the way to school.  Thank you, my neighbor.  Thank you.  Thank you, my listener.  Thank you, my listener. 
[01:19:30]  And I want to apologize to Boston that we put a black guy on the radio.  I'm sorry.  We'll be more careful in the future.  All right.  Thank you, Lewis.  All right.  Thanks, man.  We move on to Dog.  Now he gets to see a video of Tucker, his son's girlfriend, for the first time.  He's never seen this girl.  Really?  That he was talking all kinds of s about.  Ooh.  And he's just brilliant last night.  He's great.  I believe that Dwayne is a racist, because I've heard many times what he says about me. 
[01:20:00]  Not just this one time, but a lot of things he says and a lot of things he does.  I want to take this moment out to say that I've never been in any trouble, so I really don't get you judging my character.  You've never met me.  I have never met her.  She's a cute little girl.  I didn't know that.  I didn't never know what she looked like.  Well, you have an opportunity tonight. 
[01:20:30]  You started to talk to her earlier.  You want to say anything to her?  Well, I like to say, you know, I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm not like that.  You know that.  I'm very sorry.  I have it.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, is he graveling?  I think this guy really likes being on TV.  He lost his mind.  He's awful.  And loves that people know who he is.  Oh.  Wow.  Joe Piscopo looks like George Pataki.  That's Piscopo? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  He does look like Pataki.  Doesn't he look like Pataki now?  Sorry.  Wait, wait.  I had nothing to what you just said, though.  I just repeated what you said and agreed with it.  Another guy getting a little too old to dye his hair, by the way.  He's right about there.  He only has about a year or two left with that dye job thing before he starts looking creepy.  We've got to get like a montage of celebrities that dye their hair way too long.  I think that would be something cool to check out on a website where they just get to the point they look creepy because they continue dying.  Ooh.  Hey, where's Sam, by the way? 
[01:21:30]  Could we have Sam?  How about Robert Redford and that dye job?  Oh.  It looked like he had the equivalent of a red oven mitt on his head.  Like, you're 70.  It was perfect hair.  Sam, as a black gentleman.  Yes.  Would you like to see Dog the Bounty Hunter kill himself?  I think just the fact that he would kill himself is enough for me, and I'm ready to forgive.  You're ready to forgive.  All right.  Forgive if he kills himself.  Look, the forgiving is the healing. 
[01:22:00]  It's starting.  More importantly, I think Sam, for the first time, has admitted on our show that he has a little of the black blood.  We all know he does.  That's not what I said.  You willingly came to the mic as a black gentleman.  I was just asked to the mic, and just to give my opinion, I thought we were all going to give opinions.  I didn't realize that kind of thing.  No, no, not all.  You ever meet your girlfriend's parents?  Yeah.  How do they feel about her interracial choice?  Come on, no.  And boyfriends.  Well, they actually made Sam stand half in, half out of the house. 
[01:22:30]  Like, the right side of him they talked to, and the left half had to stay on the porch.  Have there been any problems dating a white woman?  No, no problems dating a white woman.  No, you don't find any racism when you're out there.  Not so far.  No.  Okay.  Which is good.  Yeah.  Thank you, Sam.  The throw is looking nice, too.  Sam's not black.  His ancestor's Thomas Jefferson. 
[01:23:00]  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure?  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a mm-mm, white or a mm-mm, yeah, we're teasing, you know.  Because he's white with an afro. 
[01:23:30]  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  Well, that's one man's opinion.  We think there's something going on there, Sam.  Joe, Long Island City, what's up?  How you doing?  How long is it going to be before you get Al Sharpton?  No, Al Sharpton's not going to touch this one.  You know that.  I know.  I think, actually, Dog the Bounty Hunter last week was trying to get a meeting with Al Sharpton.  Yeah.  I don't know why you would ever want a meeting with Al Sharpton.  Nothing good will come of that, ever. 
[01:24:00]  Nothing comes out of that.  He's offered to kill himself.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  Yeah, we just need black people to call our show and say they will forgive Dog the Bounty Hunter if he kills himself.  I want to see his level of commitment if he will kill himself.  I am inviting him on my show, the Reverend Al Show, to kill himself.  First, I want to talk with him about healing and loving each other as brothers of man and not race. 
[01:24:30]  And then we will string him up and have a live hanging on the Reverend Al Sharpton show.  Let's kill the mullet-headed white man.  What's wrong with the mullet there, Reverend Al?  I don't know, but you could see him kill himself at 7 o'clock on my show.  Pinpoint listening.  I must get to pinpoint listening.  It's all about pinpoint listening.  Pinpoint listening.  I know the business end of this. 
[01:25:00]  Meow.  Meow.  All right.  Let's give Dog the Bounty Hunter.  These are the big gets today.  The two clips talking about slavery on Hannity's TV show last night.  Hannity and Cole.  Talking about his home in Mount Vernon.  In Mount Vernon, correct.  Oh, yeah.  A little setup.  Sorry.  Talking about George Washington's house and seeing where the slaves were buried.  There's your setup for this clip.  Yeah.  Talking about his home in Mount Vernon.  In Mount Vernon, correct. 
[01:25:30]  And so they said, well, we want to show you, Dog, where we buried the slaves.  And I'm like, okay, right?  I know that sounds morbid, but I wanted to see that.  He said, okay, there's where it's at.  And there was this blank hill, right?  And there were no markers.  Oh, see right there.  He's already learned his lesson.  He said blank hill.  Ah, see?  He's self-edited.  That's what they called the burial crown.  Very good observation, Jimmy.  A little inappropriate.  Damn, Jimmy.  But it's a good observation.  Maybe Dog is learning. 
[01:26:00]  Oof.  He's checking himself.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my gosh.  Now we've got to replay that part of the clip.  Let's go to John.  He's our black brother in Jersey.  Can I say that, John?  Is that okay to say black brother?  Yeah.  We're brothers from another mother, right?  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  What do you got, John?  Well, I'd like to say that I forgive Dog as long as he kills himself.  It's a really brutal way.  All right.  So far, we're up to two and a half people. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Two and a half black people have said that they will forgive if Dog, the bounty hunter, kills himself.  Yep.  Thank you, John.  I think it's important.  No problem.  Hey, John, wait, wait, wait.  Percentages.  What's up?  Are you 100% black, 50% black?  How black are you?  75.  All right, 75.  75.  All right, so now we're down to two and a quarter black.  So we either need a really, really white black.  We either need a black Republican to make up the other quarter black, or we need an African 
[01:27:00]  to be 1.25.  We basically need Grace Jones to call the radio show.  Yes.  All right.  Make up for that quarter black.  Even this out.  Or that guy, that actor guy with the weird name that's in every black film.  Yafit Kodo?  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's like Kodo.  He's very dark.  Yes, he is.  He was in Amistad.  Or Amistad.  Amistad.  All right, here's that clip again where he saw the black graves. 
[01:27:30]  Okay.  The graves of the slaves.  And there was this blank hill, right?  And there were no markers at all, right?  And I said to him, what do you mean?  And I said, this is where, and he said, there's five family buried there.  There's buried there.  There's buried there.  And I said, well, where's their grave markers at?  And he said, you know, he said, we buried him with their feet towards the Potomac.  And he said it kind of, and I was like, hey, but, uh, you know, watch what you talk.  You know, what are you saying? 
[01:28:00]  Because I was getting a little aggravated that he was talking stink like that.  Oh, you are just the worst.  Watch how you talk.  You watch how you talk.  Why, was his son trying to date one of them and you were reprimanding them?  Hey, I know what you're trying to do there, but let's make it official.  We got to play the bleep game with that last clip.  We'll give it back to the boys and they'll bleep it to make it sound a little different.  Okay.  My first one hit the mark perfectly. 
[01:28:30]  It did.  And finally, dog wants to be buried with the slaves.  Here it is, the last clip of Dog the Bounty Hunter on his apology appearance on Hannity and Combs last night.  He said, no, dog.  He said, the black people back then, when they died, they wanted their feet buried towards the Potomac  so they could walk over the river when they passed away back to Africa.  And I thought, oh, my God, there's not a marker in there.  I told the Lord, and two Catholic ladies own that property, so I've already made phone calls. 
[01:29:00]  I'm going to be buried right in that center.  Oh, my God.  This could be the most amazing piece of audio in recent memory.  I cannot get over what a boob this guy is.  That he's thinking this is going to help?  Yeah.  This will get him back on TV.  I can't understand why people would want to be buried with their feet pointed a certain way,  whereas if you're going to walk across the ocean, why could you just get up and go, oh, no, it's that way. 
[01:29:30]  It's that way.  It's that way.  It's that way.  Yeah, why do you have to be pointed in that direction?  I don't know.  In death, you lose all directions.  Yeah, you just have to be pointed in the right direction.  You're like a zombie.  You just kind of get up and go, oh, and just start walking forward.  And why would you be, yeah, why would you be facing the, where, what am I trying to say?  Never mind.  I'm going to, I'm bailing.  I'm bailing.  I punched out.  I had a thought, but it just got scrambled.  All right, here we go.  Back to this.  I told the Lord, and I, two Catholic ladies own that property, so I've already made phone calls. 
[01:30:00]  I'm going to be buried right in that center.  Is there a deal to do that?  I'm making a deal.  She told me, dog, absolutely.  Because I will never be forgiven as I'm alive, and you and I know that.  But they'll be able to say forever and ever, dog is sorry.  They'll come someday to their children who come to this day, why is dog buried there?  Why is that white man lay there? 
[01:30:30]  And they'll be able to say, because that white man made a terrible mistake, and he requested that.  So it's almost like he's saying he's punishing himself by burying himself with...  Right, right.  He hasn't learned a thing.  It's like people say, why is that white man buried with these people?  Right, I'm going to give myself the ultimate punishment.  Yeah.  I'm going to be laid to rest with these people.  Because he did something terrible.  So he has to.  What an ass!  He said something terrible. 
[01:31:00]  Now he has to lay with them forever.  Forever.  For all eternity.  The one big marker in the middle of this cemetery on Washington's property.  Dog the Bounty Hunter.  Right.  With any logo on the cross.  Right.  He is so self-important.  And people will come by and say, why?  No, people won't even notice.  No.  Or care.  We could give you a list of people that have effed up in the past and no one even remembers  their names anymore.  But they'll say, like, why is this white man? 
[01:31:30]  I like the conversations he thought are going to be happening.  Yeah.  500 years.  Yeah.  Right.  100 years from now.  He hopes people aren't dead yet before he can make excuses.  And he thinks in 500 years or so there's going to be this big discussion about him.  He's thinking that he's going to have that eternal flame like JFK.  Yeah.  And people are going to come around from all over to see where he's laid to rest.  Stop it.  Why is this white man buried here?  And then the father will take off his hat and look at the son.  Because he made a terrible mistake. 
[01:32:00]  This is hell.  Has he even, like, thought about how black people would feel?  I know black people are pretty touchy about where slaves are buried.  Right.  There was a whole thing that happened here in Manhattan.  They were building a building project.  They started excavating and they found that there was a black slave graveyard.  Or whatever.  Yeah.  And the building stopped and that was it.  They had to make some kind of a cemetery park on top of it. 
[01:32:30]  And that was pretty much it.  Do you think...  So could they build a multi-million dollar condo around this thing?  Oh, hell yeah.  Money's got to be made, people.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  It's 2007.  Out.  But Dog thinks that black people are just going to be like, yeah, okay, desecrate this sacred  ground of our forefathers that were brought here by putting this white trash mullet head  in there.  Next stop, Larry King tonight.  Can't wait. 
[01:33:00]  I've already DVR'd it.  A double boobage.  You know what I did?  I DVR'd this on two TVs just in case something gets messed up.  You've got to.  And you've got to run, like, start it earlier in the show.  Oh, I did that as well.  And end it later so you don't miss a delicious second.  I did that as well.  That's a delicious second.  I did that as well.  Tyrone, Long Island, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  What's up, my end?  Hey.  I've got two ways that Cracker can redeem himself. 
[01:33:30]  He can bring that fat bitch wife of his to the hood and drop her off and let us jump  her in like you jump a guy into the gang.  Oh.  Because we're almost done with Lisa Lampanelli.  Or we can get that guy that played Debo and have him just choke his cracker ass out  on national TV.  Well, you know what's really funny?  That would be funny if Doggy's as an excuse.  Like, of course I can.  I feel like I'm black.  Look at the fat white girl I'm with. 
[01:34:00]  Is that not a tribute to the brothers?  I'm doing all I can here.  Travis in the Bronx.  I didn't realize how many people were listening from the Bronx until today.  What's up, Travis?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Well, yeah.  Pretty much want to say this guy, he's retarded.  He thinks he's Dog Doolittle.  The white guy that could talk to black people.  Oh, my God.  Dog Doolittle.  And I really don't know what to say about this guy.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[01:34:30]  I would also love to say I will forgive him if he shaves off that ratty-looking mullet,  eats it, and then kills himself.  Yeah.  Eats his mullet.  Yeah, make sure you keep the kills-himself part.  Dog Doolittle.  You heard it here on our show.  Dog would kill himself if that meant that black people would forgive him.  We've got to get a petition going.  Dude, I'm going to laugh about that all day.  That would be funny.  Bravo to you, Travis.  Hey, can't wait to see you Friday, Jimmy. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, thanks a lot, man.  Yeah, Caroline.  Thank you, man.  Big gig for Jimmy.  Guys, that's funny.  Let's say hi to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch, what's up?  Good morning.  Tonight, I'm Larry King.  He's offering 40 acres and a mullet.  Cigars and Scotch, always good for one.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Lola from Jersey.  Lola.  Yes.  Hey.  Wait, I heard the dog is making a movie about his ship.  It's called the Amidope. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, we're revving up.  This flight is about to take off.  Go ahead, Lola.  Well, I just don't get why, if he's so sorry and he's a brother, then why can't his son  date?  Yeah, then why did he have such a problem?  What's with the apology?  I mean, he's avoiding the whole issue.  He's just a babbling ass.  That's what makes this so much fun.  He actually is going to be buried with slaves. 
[01:36:00]  Like, people are going to give a crap.  Well, I don't know why people do the crap to begin with, anyway.  Except for the black people that don't want him there.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Lola.  Let's go to Karen in Westchester.  Karen.  Hi.  Hey.  I just think he should have just said, yeah, I said it.  It's between me and my son.  Like, Alec Baldwin.  He never really apologized.  No.  Alec, well, this is, you know, again, the difference is the racial stuff, and, you know, 
[01:36:30]  it's a PC world.  It's sickening, but it's the truth.  Yeah.  It is sickening.  But I like where you're coming from, that it was a private conversation, but you're not  being realistic for him to just go, yeah, I said it.  That wouldn't fly either.  And he wouldn't just go, well, he's got a point.  All right.  Thank you.  But there's a line between, yeah, I said it, and I'm going to kill myself and be buried  with slaves.  Yeah.  There's got to be a happy medium there.  We're going to be looking up black movies during the break if you want to join the fun  after the break. 
[01:37:00]  Starks.  Hey, what's up?  Brooklyn.  What's up?  How's retirement, John?  Oh.  Someone got it out there.  Brooklyn.  A little basketball stuff.  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn.  What's up?  What's up, Starks?  Killing, man.  Yep.  It's good.  Yo, I'm putting my piece in, kid.  I want to do the kill himself.  Plain and simple.  You forgive him, right?  If he kills himself, you'll forgive him.  Forgive him.  I'm like, yo, like yesterday, you dig?  I'm in.  All right.  Thanks, Starks.  All right.  Starks is in.  We'll take a break here.  But first, Dan in Jersey. 
[01:37:30]  Dan?  Hey.  Yeah.  I'd like to forgive Dog only on the ground that he kills himself with his big fat cow  wife.  I'm half black.  So that completes the side that Sam said.  You know, he said...  Yeah.  You and Sam make one black person.  So that's good.  We can up our total here.  We're back together.  All right.  Fair enough.  Watch it out, guys.  Thank you, Dan.  All right.  No problem.  Yeah.  That's just amazing, though.  I can't get enough of that.  He would kill himself if that meant people would...  He said it, and he was serious. 
[01:38:00]  Like, he said it as if people would believe him.  Right, right.  All right.  Everything he said, he said like people would believe that.  I want to be buried when people come by and say, why is that white man...  He's not going to say anything.  Hey, can we get Sean Hannity on the show next?  Got to congratulate him, man.  Oh, bravo.  That's just some great stuff last night.  Yeah.  I just...  I don't know if we should continue our friendship.  If he's going to be doing comedy shows like that, we're in direct competition.  Yeah, but also, I don't like the fact that because I never knew that Hannity was a... 
[01:38:30]  Lover.  I didn't do that one right.  I screwed up.  I just curse.  All right.  We're going to regroup.  Ooh.  Thanks to Jimmy.  Aw.  Hey, I...  Whoa.  Hey, I'm entitled.  I had a little car crash.  One of many.  Yeah, well.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:39:00]  Stay there.  Another busy morning for the show.  Opie and Anthony.  Mmm.  Thanks for checking us out.  We do appreciate that.  Shove some food down your throat.  I know.  I know it's a busy show and it takes...  Still, like, right now to start eating breakfast.  Yeah.  I shoved some egg whites and vegetables.  This is a three-break little plastic thing of cantaloupe.  It's taken three breaks so far and I still have some left.  Yeah.  Jesus. 
[01:39:30]  Whip them out Wednesday.  That's happening.  Thank you to the ladies that are flashing the guys and the gals that have WOW stickers  on their cars.  That's what those WOW stickers mean out there.  Whip them out Wednesday.  And if you're in one of those areas where the radio station's kind of lazy, you can always  get involved with WOW by making a homemade WOW sign and throwing that on your car.  All right.  Women out there know that means Whip them out Wednesday.  They know that means you're looking for a little excitement on the way to work today.  All right?  And it's happening all the time. 
[01:40:00]  It just makes for kind of boring radio to take call after call after call of people getting  flashed.  Dude, it's so booze great.  It's also Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Did a couple of those this morning.  We've had better weeks.  We've had better weeks.  Absolutely.  We'll see what next week brings on that one.  I think most of the people are up at this point.  Can't say that Wednesday.  We had a few of those.  And Morning Zoo bit of the day Wednesday.  I don't know what's going on with that.  Don't know what's going on with that.  But maybe we'll have a Morning Zoo bit before the end of the show. 
[01:40:30]  I hope so.  Let's say hi to Mark.  What?  I love the Morning Zoo bits.  No, the one he brought in, I wasn't digging.  No?  Yeah.  Stan's looking at me like I'm nuts.  Well, I am, but Eminem's got to pay.  That one?  What is this one about?  I think we need to call Sam the expert on the Morning Zoo bits.  All right.  Let's bring Sam in.  You see, E-Rock's pretty much an expert, too, on the Morning Zoo bits.  Well, he just picked Scott and Todd bits, though.  We want to, like, get a little variety in this bit. 
[01:41:00]  He used to work for them, right?  Ugh.  What do you got there, Sam?  Tainted.  What is that?  Eminem's got to pee?  Yeah.  Well, it's a hilarious parody song.  I love the movie.  Full of laughs, is it, Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's cracking up.  Yeah?  It's a hilarious parody song.  And it's like, I think it's, uh, he rhymes me, but it sounds like it's pee. 
[01:41:30]  And so it's a song about Eminem, but he has to go to the bathroom.  Oh, that sounds good.  So it's pretty, it's pretty good.  F Jane Seymour!  That's what I say!  F her!  Is that her?  She looks good.  Yeah, well, she's off Dancing with the Stars.  She looks sexy, man.  Goodbye.  That's Jane Seymour?  F her, Jimmy!  Saying no to my mom as far as an autograph went back in the day.  All due respect, I wouldn't mind throwing her a nice one.  That'd be punishment for her, wouldn't it?  Maybe she was a busy gal.  A busy gal in an elevator with five other people? 
[01:42:00]  It's a perfect opportunity to sign something.  Maybe she was on her BlackBerry.  There was no BlackBerrys back in the day.  There was no interruption.  A BlackBerry.  There was no interruption.  Cell phones?  No?  Nothing.  It was a planner, a day planner back then.  There was no cell phones when my...  Maybe she was looking at her day planner.  When my mom asked for an autograph from Jane Seymour, and Jane said no, and then the elevator  ride was awkward for everybody involved.  So I say, F you!  Hope you get more food poisoning.  And she admitted that she has booby plants. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She said she got them put in, what, a few years ago for some role?  A couple of years ago.  What was it?  Wedding Crashers?  Yeah.  Dr. Quinn medicine whore.  But then she said that they had a specialty make-em because they were smaller than any...  Yeah, she couldn't...  Any plants that were on the market.  She couldn't say enough how small they were and how the doctor had to order them special.  Yeah.  Ew, lowercase A cups?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't waste your time.  Anyway, go ahead, Sam.  So, no, I just found this song, and I wanted to share it with you guys because I just thought 
[01:43:00]  it was funny.  Well, this is out of Virginia.  Tommy and Rumble.  Yeah.  From WNOR.  Giving them a little exposure on the Opie and Anthony network today.  This is your Morning Zoo bit of the day.  Guess who's back?  Back again.  And he's wearing A.D. pens.  Now I'm back again and a little bit hyper.  I'm wearing rubber pants and a grown-up diaper. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, I did see that coming.  Ain't nothing sadder.  A rapper from Detroit without control of his bladder.  So let's just see what's wrong with me.  Perhaps it's my physiology.  Or more to the point, my urology.  That's the cause of all this apology.  Now my friends all think that I'm cursed.  I was born with an uncontrollable thirst.  I drink and drink and it's worse and worse.  Stand back, I think I'm gonna...  Now it feels like I gotta pee.  In fact, it feels like a lot of pee.  So everybody look away from me.  While I try to empty little me. 
[01:44:00]  Now it feels like I've gotta pee.  In fact, it feels like a lot of pee.  We got it the first time.  Everybody look away from me.  While I try to empty little me.  Yes, Jimmy.  Two things.  Two things.  I will say.  Oh, he sings well.  Sounds a lot like the original song.  Sure.  I give him that much.  The chorus is atrociously written.  The part before the chorus, as far as just writing for commercial radio, is not that bad.  But the chorus wrecks it.  It just...  I gotta pee.  Oh, stop it.  So before that, you were thinking maybe Jim Norton would like to be on their show, is what 
[01:44:30]  you were saying.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I was only saying that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be the writing of it for a  production value is good, but there's no laughs in here.  No, no.  Aren't you?  Nope.  You had a couple chuckles.  You had.  Really?  You were listening and I was...  Lemon and iced tea.  Bloody Mary mix for something extra spicy.  No team. 
[01:45:00]  I'm still feeling dry like a tub of weed and Kenya on the 4th of July.  My constant thirst is not abating, but my pea-sized bladder keeps inflating.  My adult diaper is now parading.  Out of the pants, I'm irrigating.  This irrigating is irritating.  Embarrassing and humiliating.  Because I'm non-stop emanating and spraying homemade lemonade.  Now it feels like I gotta pee.  In fact, it feels like a lot of pee.  So everybody look away from me while I try to empty little me.  Now it feels like I've gotta pee. 
[01:45:30]  In fact, it feels like a lot of pee.  So everybody look away from me while I try to empty little me.  They really melded in on the chorus, didn't they?  Yeah.  I've been holding it since Cleveland.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, there you go.  That's some fantastic stuff right there.  Wow.  I'm sorry I made Mark from Kentucky wait so long.  Go ahead, Mark. 
[01:46:00]  Hey, this is Mike.  How you doing?  Hey, what's up, Mark?  Hey, uh...  Yeah, that whole, uh...  The whole deal was dogged about it.  I don't think...  You know, I'm black.  Like, I don't think the man should apologize.  You guys are giving this stuff way too much credence.  When you guys start tap dancing or tiptoeing on eggshells, you're going to start tap dancing on landmines.  And that's what this has come to.  This man had a private conversation with his son, and now he loses his job over it.  Yeah, that's the world we live in. 
[01:46:30]  Yep.  I don't disagree with you, but it's the world we live in.  That's completely nonsensical.  And I'll say this, too.  The biggest racists I've ever met in my life are black people.  They have no problems calling white folks cracker.  They call each other the n-word.  I feel like a third grader saying the n-word.  You know what?  Are you really black, sir?  You sound like a white guy doing an impression of an ideal black guy.  He's not.  Let's be honest, though.  Cracker never really caught on like the n-word. 
[01:47:00]  Cracker didn't have the thing.  No.  You could call me cracker all day long.  Couldn't care less.  I could give a crap.  Or could care less.  Honky.  Honky, all that stuff.  None of those things ever really caught on like the n-word.  Nope.  The n-word is the stairway to heaven of all racial slurs.  Pretty soon, white folks are going to get sick and tired of the guilt.  All right.  A lot of people say you're not black, sir.  But thank you for your opinion.  I don't think he's black either.  Hey, speaking of Dog the Bounty Hunter, Sam took the audio we just played for you a little 
[01:47:30]  while ago, and we're going to play the beep game today.  Ooh.  You never know when we're going to play the beep game, right?  I like the beep game.  Want to explain the beep game, Anthony?  Well, we take a piece of audio that's innocent enough, and with a few beeps, your imagination  runs wild.  And you automatically fill in a horrid word underneath a beep.  And it turns an innocent conversation into something not so innocent.  It just makes it funny. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  So remember when Dog was the, remember when?  Do you remember?  When we were talking about.  It was a few minutes ago.  Do you remember the time?  Oh, God.  Was that embarrassing?  What?  That whole thing started with Dice in that steakhouse when he took us out to dinner.  Oh, with the baked potato.  It was first with the, he wanted his steak butterflied.  Right.  Instead of just cooked.  He wanted it cut open so it was thinner and butterflied. 
[01:48:30]  So he ordered it that way, and it came as just a regular big, fat, nice steak.  And anybody else would have been like, excuse me, waiter, I ordered this butterflied.  And they would be like, oh, oh, perhaps I'll take it back, and this will be fun.  Dice goes, excuse me, come here, come here.  Do you remember, like, five minutes ago when I was telling you what I wanted?  Oh, sir. 
[01:49:00]  Do you remember?  And the guy is, it's the waiter.  And all, I had my head in my hands going, this is the most embarrassing moment.  And my potato, I wanted my potato grilled.  I wanted the skin burned on the grill.  Do you remember?  I was sitting next to Joey Paisano.  We were mortified.  Embarrassing.  It was the first time we all hung out with Dice, and we hung out with him many times after that. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  But we didn't know what to expect hanging out with Dice for the first time.  And he had them so frazzled in this steak joint, a really nice steak joint.  Remember by the end of it, because the grill was in the dining room area, basically, Anthony,  so you could see the steaks being cooked?  Yeah.  And by the end of it, he had four or five people staring at the steak as...  They had to bring the steak back like three times.  Because then the guy came back with the steak after the whole remember speech, 
[01:50:00]  and then he went at it again.  Yeah.  Na, na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na, na.  See, I was used to it, because I was touring with...  That was my first dinner with you guys.  Yeah.  I was used to it, because I was on the...  Oh, yeah.  I would look around at everybody else, and they're just...  And then a couple of people came up to say hi to Dice, and stupid Kenny just gets up.  He jumps up and gets right up.  Hey!  Take a walk for yourself.  Can't you see the legends eating? 
[01:50:30]  Kenny loved putting his big mustache in front of people.  Oh, he did.  Trying to say hello?  I found a mustachioed picture of Kenny the other day, as I was going through some photos,  and just hysterical.  We forced him to shave that thing.  She'd grow that back.  No, we forced him to shave that thing.  Oh, I wanted to grow that thing back.  That dumb thing.  I forgot how awful that was until I see the old photos.  Yeah.  Why did I ever like you?  Yeah.  Why did I ever like you?  All right.  Here we go.  So we're playing...  How did I even hang out around with you?  So we're playing the bleep game.  So just remember when we played the clip of Dog talking about seeing George Washington's 
[01:51:00]  house and the graveyard.  Yeah.  Well, we added a few bleeps in it.  A few bleeps?  Talking about his home in Mount Vernon.  In Mount Vernon.  Correct.  And so they said, well, we want to show you, Dog, where we buried the bleep.  And I'm like, okay, right?  I know that sounds morbid, but I wanted to see that.  He said, okay, there's where it's at.  And there was this blank hill, right?  And there were no bleepers at all, right?  And I said... 
[01:51:30]  What the hell is wrong with you, Sam?  Wow.  I've got to take a breath.  Oh, that's bad.  Because we're all looking at Sam like, why didn't you bleep the blank line?  But then he puts up his finger like, hold on, hold on, wait for it.  Wait for it.  Sam made an executive call, and it was a good one.  That was a real good one.  I wanted to see that.  He said, okay, there's where it's at.  And there was this blank hill, right? 
[01:52:00]  And there were no bleepers at all, right?  And I said to him, what do you mean?  And I said, this is where...  And he said, there's five bleepers married there.  There's buried there.  There's buried there.  And I said, well, where's the bleepers at?  And he said, you know, he said, we buried him with their feet towards the Potomac.  And he said it kind of...  And I was like, hey, but, you know, watch what you talk.  You know, what are you saying?  Because I was getting a little aggravated that he was talking bleepers like that. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, my God.  You know what?  You outdid yourself with the bleep.  That's a good one.  Let it be known.  Bravo.  The black gentleman put that together.  The black gentleman.  We got to use you to our advantage.  You got to start admitting you're black.  We can get away with a hell of a lot of good stuff.  God, that's funny.  All you have to do is admit you're black.  And, man, this show changes tomorrow.  Worked well for Howard back in the day.  I don't know if the genetic evidence is there.  I'm sure it is.  Just admit on our show you're black.  And then we could do all...  You could pretty much be, like, you could have your own microphone every day. 
[01:53:00]  You get to sit down every day with the big boys.  Really?  That's all it takes.  Wow.  You're a very light-skinned black guy.  You could live among white people like W.D. Fard, who, I believe, was the inspiration  for Elijah Miller.  All right.  Sam put another one together.  Dog talks about being buried with the slaves.  You might remember when we did this a little while ago.  Do you remember a few minutes ago?  Well...  It was, like, minutes ago. 
[01:53:30]  You can't remember?  Oh, God.  And Sam does such a great job of this.  We've got to make sure people understand.  We added these beeps to make it funny.  Simple as that.  The beep game.  He said, no, dog.  He said, the f***ing people back then, when they died, they wanted their feet buried towards  the Potomac so they could walk over the river when they passed away back to Africa.  And I thought, oh, my God.  There's a f***er in there. 
[01:54:00]  I told the Lord.  And two Catholic ladies own that property.  So I've already made phone calls.  I'm going to be buried right in that f***ing center.  You've made a deal to do that?  I'm making a deal.  She told me, dog, absolutely.  Because I will never be forgiven as I'm alive.  And you and I know that.  But they'll be able to say, forever and ever, dog is sorry.  They'll come someday to their children will come to there and say, why is dog buried there? 
[01:54:30]  Why is that white man lay there?  And they'll be able to say, because that white man made a terrible mistake and he requested that.  There you go.  He's crying through that.  Again, it is so hysterical how he presents it as a punishment for him to have to lay with them.  With them.  With them for eternity.  That's why you should never talk.  Because you just bury yourself further.  Just shut your mouth.  Bury yourself further with them.  If you understand what he's saying there, ignore the beeps. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  He wants to punish himself to the point that he wants to be buried with those people is basically what he's saying.  So that his relatives will have to visit him and have to tread amongst the graves of those people.  Of those people.  And he's only going to drink grape soda for the rest of his life.  Cheetos.  And he also said earlier that if, if, wait, he would kill himself.  What was the line?  To be forgiven, he would kill himself. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  If it meant that black people would forgive him, he would kill himself.  So with that, we get this from Tim.  Dog the bounty hunter is sorry for what he has said.  Of course, all black people in America, I owe an apology to.  He is sorry.  I've learned a lesson.  So very, very sorry.  Sorry.  This is one of the hardest lessons I've ever learned in my life, even facing death.  Be ready to forgive.  If I could kill myself and people would forgive me, I would do that.  Call the Opie and Anthony show now at 877-212-ONA and say yes, dog. 
[01:56:00]  If I could kill myself, I forgive you, my brother.  Kill yourself.  That was great.  That's good.  And Tim doesn't even really work for the show officially.  No, he does a great job.  He pumps out production for us.  Do we give Tim money at all?  No.  Good.  Nothing.  Don't.  It'll spoil him.  Keep him hungry.  All right.  I guess we got to take a break. 
[01:56:30]  We're getting close to playing What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  We also should play the sound.  Smug guy.  Smug guy.  I love smug guy.  I love smug guy.  We haven't done a good enough job.  I know.  Letting America understand why we love smug guy on Jill TV.  He's a black dude and he's got glasses and he always holds the mic.  Instead of straight up, he holds it kind of at an angle and his lips are kind of to the side like he's whispering.  He just looks cocky.  And everything he's saying is just like, I know about this or this is a problem. 
[01:57:00]  But of course this happened.  Look at the neighborhood I'm in.  And when he stops talking, he looks a little bit and he has like this awful smirk on his face.  He's just the greatest.  Yeah.  And he's always mid-nod when they throw it to him.  Like, yeah, you knew this was coming.  Yeah, yeah.  Holding the mic to the side is what does it.  I'm telling you.  It doesn't look reportedly.  It just looks like a guy.  They handed a microphone.  They say, could you talk?  Someone's sick. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  So we're getting ready to play.  What did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  And once again, the sound you need to hear tomorrow between 7 and 7.30 if you want to win that $1,000.  You got it?  There it is.  On.  Five.  Yep.  There it is.  And it is.  Shut up.  There you go.  That's what you're listening for tomorrow between 7 and 7.30.  Okay.  For all the contest rules, go to onaradio.com.  If you don't know what this $1,000 contest is all about, please do that. 
[01:58:00]  Please.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  We're heading into our speed round.  Yeah.  Speed round.  Yeah.  No.  Not a speed round.  Just had it there.  Every time he walks in the studio now, I go, that's the guy.  That's the guy.  He's famous to me.  Hey, Tim, do a few cartoon voices for us, will you?  Yeah, do one of those voices.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Go.  I don't do any cartoon voices.  That's horrible.  It's even worse.  Why?  I love it, though.  I can see his face.  His unshaven face works. 
[01:58:30]  I can see his face.  Shut up.  You just want to kind of slap him.  Oh, yeah.  With a car.  Wait.  Do all your voices.  Go through the gamut there.  Do both of them?  Yeah, do all of them.  Do both of them.  Oh, it's only two?  Well, it's variations.  It's variations of different kinds.  Well, Tim, why don't you do some more voices?  I don't want to.  Oh, God.  It's awful.  It's awful. 
[01:59:00]  It really is.  There's a physical feeling I get when you.  Yeah, it's visceral.  Yeah.  I can't get enough of it.  You know how you take some aspects of this radio show home with you?  Do you start doing it around your apartment or your house?  I do that with two girls, one cup.  I don't want more.  I don't want to clean out my food pockets.  I was thinking about doing a rock scream like that.  Yeah?  All right.  Wait for Tuesday.  We need that sound. 
[01:59:30]  You know the rules.  Wait for Tuesday.  I don't know for what.  I'm going to chase away mice.  Yeah.  Wait for Tuesday.  Why don't you tie your shoes, Tim?  My laces are untied.  I'm going to trip.  Now I'm doing it.  You think he's going to trip?  He'll trip because that's what happens with untied laces.  You know why he still feels like a burnout in high school?  Yeah.  Tim's fighting middle age.  He still thinks he's like a high school burnout with the laces all crazy.  He probably smokes butts.  Butts.  Tim's a boob.  He is a burnout because he can't reenact his voices live in our show, by the way. 
[02:00:00]  No.  And there are more than two.  No improv skills at all.  All he did was go, I'm doing voices.  No, I'm not.  Yes, I am.  His big moment.  That's all he had.  He's brilliant in the production room, though.  That's where Tim lives.  He comes alive.  That's what a million people got today.  There you go.  That's what you get.  Testing.  One, two, three.  Jesus, Tim.  Did he just count to three?  Yes, he did.  Why did he only count to three? 
[02:00:30]  It really was.  We're really trying to develop that thing, and he's not helping matters at all.  So annoying.  He's killing the bit faster than we would like.  Hey, Dog the Bounty Hunter, we were just playing the beep game.  Well, we have a brand new version of the theme song, just in case A&E decides to continue production of Dog the Bounty Hunter.  You know, you've got to change the theme song a little bit.  Certainly.  The fear and darkness all around you 
[02:01:00]  The c***s are on the run  You know you've been hiding in the mud  I'll hunt you down cause I'm the dog  I'm the dog  The big bad dog  I'm the dog 
[02:01:30]  The c*** Hunter  The c*** Hunter  Wow  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I love Ozzy.  You don't like that?  I hate it.  Why?  I kind of like it.  I thought it was just somebody doing a real Ozzy ripoff.  I'm the dog!  The big bad dog!  What's he doing, Ozzy?  I thought that was just somebody doing an imitation of Ozzy.  No, it's him.  It's really Ozzy?  I love Ozzy.  Why would Ozzy do that? 
[02:02:00]  Probably a million dollars  Yeah, but he's got like  God smack his  Sharon threw him up in front of a mic and made him do it.  Someone did the Criss Angel song?  These guys do this now  Cause the networks give them a lot of money.  Who does the Criss Angel song?  Because that is so utterly bad.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I know God was talking about it.  The Mind Freak song where he's standing there like he's an 80s rocker.  Hey, who does the...  Oh, I like that song.  No, you don't.  I don't mind that.  No, you don't.  I'm the dog.  It sounds like one of Tim's voices.  The big bad dog.  Oh, does Sam know? 
[02:02:30]  Sam?  I think Criss Angel does it himself.  Oh, well.  Oh, he's one of those guys that wants to be a rock star, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he absolutely does.  I love when comedians want to be rock stars.  That's my favorite.  Yeah.  Has that ever worked out?  Not really.  No, I didn't hurt.  I'm trying to think.  It didn't help.  Yeah, no.  Hey, the two girls one cup phenomenon continues.  Want to play the one from yesterday?  And then we got a brand new one from D.L. Hughley, the great D.L. Hughley, who's playing  Town Hall here in New York City Saturday night. 
[02:03:00]  We screened it for him.  We did.  You want to explain the two girls one cup phenomenon?  Oh, it's wonderful.  There are two girls and a cup.  And during the course of the video, the cup gets filled up.  To the tippy top.  To the tippity, tippity top.  Dare I say, over the tippity top.  Yeah, over the tippity top.  With what I could only see as being chocolate mousse.  That's right.  And then the girls decide to share the chocolate mousse together. 
[02:03:30]  And they throw up and it's awful.  Yeah.  It is a horrific video.  And they throw up.  I guess they ate too much mousse.  Yes, they throw up.  But they don't want to waste the mousse.  They throw up back on the mousse and then eat it again.  Yes.  Because they're good girls.  It's a horrific video.  But what's great about it is the fact that people are filming themselves watch the video.  Yeah.  Very, very rough to sit through.  The first few times.  Let me tell you, I'm getting a little desensitized.  Yeah.  The first time I couldn't do it.  Now I find myself, I'm able to actually watch it.  Well, here we go.  We got from yesterday, just in case you missed it. 
[02:04:00]  Six girls watching two girls, one cup.  This was their reaction.  This was really disgusting.  Okay, ready?  Okay, you can press play.  Yeah.  I'm scared now.  Click it.  I knew it was going to start off.  Look at the brown.  Shut the f*** up.  Oh, no!  That's not real. 
[02:04:30]  That's not real.  What country are they from?  Oh my god.  That's like a delicacy for that.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  And there you go. 
[02:05:00]  Six girls and their reaction to two girls, one cup.  He laughed a lot, though.  Yeah, well, that's what's great about it.  The reactions run the gamut.  Yep.  By the way, someone's pointing out that dog song, take on a new meaning now that he's an  outed racist.  There's a lyric in the song, the theme song that says, you feel the darkness all around  you.  Oh, yes. 
[02:05:30]  And you will for all eternity.  Yes, when he's buried in the black cemetery with his feet pointing at the Potomac.  I love when people f*** up because you get some great stuff.  Oh, yeah.  We should do a whole show on people f***ing up and what they try to do.  How they try to fix it.  I'm sorry I did that.  Right.  I want my feet planted facing the Potomac.  But not yet.  I'm not dead yet.  See, that mistake could be made, but damn it, leave me alone. 
[02:06:00]  Got a few good years left, right?  So now we got D.L.  Hughley.  This is a brand new one.  Another reaction to the video, Two Girls, One Cup.  Here's the great D.L.  Hughley watching that same video.  Have you seen Two Girls, One Cup yet, D.L.?  No.  Oh, it's the latest rage on the internet.  Oh, you got to see this.  And then we can move on to other things.  It's called Two Girls, One Cup.  You'll be emailing everybody with this one.  D.L., your reaction to this? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, Two Girls, One Cup.  Red, Red, Red.  D.L. Hughley.  Are you watching?  Red, you can react too.  This is D.L. Hughley, Town Hall, Saturday at 8.  Looking good, right?  Okay, that's pretty good.  You like that, right?  Right.  Nice breasts.  You guys have the best radio show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  D.L. looks right.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Come on, look.  Oh, come on, look.  Why don't you want to look?  Oh, my goodness gracious. 
[02:07:00]  I've never seen anything that disgusting in my life.  I turn into Maury.  Come on, look.  It'll help heal you.  Turn around.  Look at it.  Come on.  Come on, D.L.  I think you can turn more into one of my favorites, Angry Vince.  You're going to look at that.  D.L.  D.L. Hughley.  You look at those two girls sharing that delicious treat.  That's right.  Look at those girls.  Look at them.  Now the one is squeezing some out of her mouth into the other girl's mouth, and it's disgusting. 
[02:07:30]  But you look at it.  Look at it.  You're going to look at every minute of this video, D.L.  You're going to look at it, or you're fine.  We got a part two to the D.L. Hughley reaction?  Come on.  All right, here's more D.L. Hughley watching.  Two girls, one cup.  Oh, my goodness.  Okay, y'all can quit it now.  No, no, no. 
[02:08:00]  I need a little more.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  Uncle, Uncle, Uncle, Uncle, please.  I'm tapping out.  I'm tapping out.  Stop it.  There we go.  Hey, Red, look at that.  Look at that, Red.  Look at that.  Look at that, Red.  They just look silly.  All right.  Hey, man, you know what?  I promise you.  I promise you. 
[02:08:30]  I'm not a squeamish dude by any means.  That is the most disgusting.  I mean, damn breakfast.  I'm not even having that no more.  And there you have it.  The phenomenon continues.  That's right.  Eat your...  That's right.  You're going to eat it.  And you watch D.L.  You watch it.  Look at him eating...  That's right.  Angry Fence. 
[02:09:00]  Angry Fence.  Yeah.  We can't get in over that.  Angry Fence.  We love showing people that video.  All right.  Well, I guess we're just about done on this side of the show.  Ooh.  We didn't get to Octopus Baby today.  Was it an operational success?  Do we know?  Who the hell knows?  They might not know for a day or two, I'm guessing.  All right.  They were operating yesterday?  Yeah.  All right.  Well...  This little piggy went to market.  This little piggy stayed home.  This little piggy had roast beef.  This little piggy had none.  This little piggy went in the dumpster.  These five piggies don't even resemble piggies.  This little piggy's on the end of a carrot. 
[02:09:30]  This little piggy looks like an elephant.  This little piggy was cut off and thrown away like yesterday's news.  This little piggy belonged on someone else, but it's instead a parasite.  All right.  Let's play.  Patty cake.  Patty cake.  Ah!  Bake me a cake.  Wow, that was fast.  All those hands.  Turn on the stove.  Stir it up.  Put it in.  Take it out.  All of those hands. 
[02:10:00]  Duck, duck, goose all at the same time.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Fontaine from South Carolina.  Fontaine.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  What's up?  Hey there, Fontaine.  Opie, you're going to hate me, buddy.  I know you hate it when you change your call, but this is for Jimmy.  Brian Regan said it best when he said, it's a cup with shit in it.  Hey, you can't say that. 
[02:10:30]  You can't say that Wednesday.  Yeah, sure, sure.  And you can't say that.  He can't say that.  He can't say that.  That's why it's called Can't Say That Wednesday.  Let's go to Brian in the Bronx.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Listen, I just wanted to thank you for informing me today that a bounty hunter is actually a  racist.  I don't know.  I'm all right.  Thank you.  Just kicking in black people's doors and spraying their face with a frigging fire extinguisher  full of mace. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  I'm sure it was a perk of his job.  You know what I mean?  Good point, Brian.  Good point.  Let's go to Ed.  Black guy.  Bronx.  What's up, Ed?  Yeah.  I'm talking about dogs.  It doesn't really make sense because that means he's continuing with the racism, I think.  But he also said that he would kill himself if that means you guys would accept his apology.  Would forgive, I guess.  Would forgive.  Sorry.  All right, Ed.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to this person. 
[02:11:30]  Hi, this person.  What's up?  With no name.  Must be a slave.  Hi.  Whoever watched.  Yeah.  It's just a blank screen.  Blank screen.  Hey, whoever watched Two Girls, One Cup.  What's up?  What's up?  You.  On the phone right now.  You go.  Ah, speak.  We're limping to the finish line because of you.  Comment.  Comment.  What's this guy doing?  You.  Go.  It's you.  What?  What's up?  The guy that just said, what's this guy doing?  It's you.  Oh, what's going on?  You idiot.  You're a head. 
[02:12:00]  What do you got?  You had me watching Two Guys, Two Girls, One Cup.  Oh, Two Guys, One Cup.  Hey, whoa.  Well, that's a different one.  Looks like you're into a little lemon party, if you know what I mean.  Looks like an old 50s movie where they're at the malt shop drinking vanilla and malted  together.  You enjoy Two Guys, huh?  Cut your losses, sir.  We'll see you guys.  Goodbye, sir.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  We got to get out of here.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm really sorry.  Jimmy's got a quick thing here. 
[02:12:30]  We'll be right back to Atlantic City, Friday and Saturday, January 18th and 19th.  This is Martin Luther King Day weekend.  Tickets are on sale at the Borgata.  TheBorgata.com.  They go on sale this Saturday morning, 10 a.m. for January 18th and 19th.  It is a holiday weekend at the Borgata in AC.  Finally going back.  All new material.  Martin Luther King weekend.  Yeah, it's going to be a big holiday weekend.  You got a little special offer for the black people?  All right.  No, no, no.  Well, to celebrate Martin Luther King's birthday, you can slap me in the face on the way out.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  You heard it here first.  We got to get out of here.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  See you tomorrow.  Back.  Back in the New York groove.  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Are they nice and firm?  Not Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:13:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie.  Opie and Anthony.  XM Satellite Radio.  Here we are.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'll say this much.  I want to say hi to everybody that was in on the gag yesterday.  There, that's it.  All right.  Let's move on.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  ONA.  It worked perfectly.  Hi, by the way.  Didn't it?  Can I have a pen when I walk in? 
[02:14:00]  That's all I want.  No, you can't, Jimmy.  No, you can't.  In your eye.  A pen and some water.  We have 20 guys.  You want a pen that's chewed up at the end?  I know how you enjoy those.  Yeah, because I'll put it right in my ass cheek and stick it right back in.  Then let's stupid eat it again.  Yes.  La, la, la, la, la.  Someone fucking ruined that, by the way.  What?  Someone called up.  Remember when Earl.  Earl chews on the fucking pens around here.  Yeah.  It's like, we ought to just fucking throw bananas in the cup.  Yeah.  For the love of God.  Leave the pens out. 
[02:14:30]  Stop it.  Stop it.  So he chews on them.  So Jimmy thought it would be great to take his pen and shove up his asshole a little bit  and let Earl chew on it.  And then I hear fucking, because I'm listening to Ron and Fez, and I'm waiting for the moment  when, you know, they start talking about the pen, and Earl puts the pen in his mouth.  Take the pen!  And I hear a caller go,  Uh, hey, Earl.  You know how you chew the pens?  Well, this is hysterical.  Jimmy, uh, put one of the pens up his ass that you chew. 
[02:15:00]  And Ronnie just went, oh, you're fantastic.  You just ruined, you know, the guy's bit for him.  Because thanks, you jackass.  Like, why would someone call up and do that?  Just because they can.  Or just because they're stupid.  Yeah, what a dope.  The payoff would have been Earl shoving Jimmy's asshole pen in his mouth.  Oh, we'll get Earl.  Oh, that would have been good.  Oh, we'll get some ass in his mouth, I tell you. 
[02:15:30]  Ass to mouth.  That's right.  You eat that shit pen.  You go ahead and eat it.  It's a stupid Earl.  You take that ass.  That's right.  Crawl around on all fours and stick your mouth on that asshole.  Oh, that's right.  Get a whole mouth full of shit.  That's right.  Like the dirty mushroom.  The dirty mushroom.  Smells good, doesn't it?  You'll like that.  Dirty mushroom.  What did you know? 
[02:16:00]  You said rotting mushroom?  Yeah, rotting mushroom yesterday.  That really conjures up a scent, an aroma.  Tastes like a copper penny, doesn't it?  Doesn't it?  You like it.  Yeah.  Copper penny with soy sauce on it.  What does a dirty ass taste like?  I mean, let's not go with shit.  That's obvious.  Well, I can't make it up.  Mushroom.  I'm going to say berries. 
[02:16:30]  Mushroom does have a taste of mushroom.  Mushroom's actually a good taste.  A little copper taste.  Copper, yeah.  A little copper.  It depends on the person.  Sometimes it smells like an armpit, which is disgusting.  A pussy can smell like that, too.  But you are not disgusted by an armpit with a little scent in there to get your nose in there.  I can be disgusted, though, unless the chemistry is good.  If I have a good chemistry with someone, that smell, that light pit smell is very fucking animal and very sexy.  However, if I don't have that chemistry with you, it stinks. 
[02:17:00]  It's like a pussy.  I like the smell of a vagina.  If it's somebody you have that with, that smell is a very animal thing.  I'm sorry.  What, sweetie?  I'm just watching these poor kids on MSNBC today.  What are they doing?  They invented wedgie-proof underwear, because apparently, looking and dressed like they do,  they were getting wedgies all the time.  Yeah, well, watch.  And now...  Don't dress like that.  Did it work?  Oh, see?  They're like Velcro, I guess.  It just rips apart.  And it rips right out of there.  So then the bully can then choke you with it. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Do the kids invent this, though?  I think they invented it.  If the little brats invented it, then good for them.  Well, that's the typical kind of kid that would get the wedgie, is some kid that would invent it.  It would rip your ball bag and get torn out anyway.  The Velcro runs into your ball bag and rip the house.  Yeah, the Velcro is going to hurt.  You ever, getting back to Jimmy's thing, you ever like a girl until you smelled her smell,  and then you couldn't even look at her anymore?  And I'm not talking about the smell of the van. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I know exactly what you mean.  Their body scent.  Their body scent.  You're like, wow, that girl's really hot.  And then you get close enough where you get to smell their smell.  And it's not like their smell after they run on a treadmill.  Just their basic smell.  Their scent.  Oh, good God, man.  There's no chemistry here.  I don't know.  We've got to move on.  Really?  Absolutely.  Girls smell good.  They smell different, though.  It's underlined.  Yeah, I know.  It's a different thing.  But girls smell good.  Unless it's...  I'm talking about their natural smell. 
[02:18:30]  I'm not talking about their fake smells with their perfume and their soaps and all that shit.  I'm talking about...  I'm talking natural, too.  There was a monster.  There was this monster in a store I went into yesterday that just the second I walked in the store, I was like...  I smelt it.  It was monster woman smell.  Big, fat woman.  Monster smell.  I just like how dogs do that.  They go...  And she just... 
[02:19:00]  She stunk.  Yeah.  But I'm not talking about monsters.  I'm talking about, like, women.  And female girls.  They smell good.  Well, I don't think they need, you know, a lot of stuff to cover anything up.  No, dude, I've had plenty of girls I've met in my life where they were clean, but there was something off.  Their natural smell.  And I didn't know why.  This one's not for me. 
[02:19:30]  It repels you.  I think that's a nature thing.  Somebody said that that was a nature.  You had something to do with DNA.  Like, if your DNA or the genetics are too close.  Oh, if you're going to make a retard.  Yeah, or something like that.  Then it turns you off.  Yeah, that's an embedded thing, which I believe.  Explain how that fucking two-headed freak yesterday got fucked on.  Well, obviously, they didn't have a sense of smell when they were dating.  Let's sit.  Clothes pin on the guy's nose as he's banging her.  Yeah, let's go to Jason in Boston.  Freak.  And think some crazy, but look.  What happened?  Look how we get the phones.  Look at that. 
[02:20:00]  You come up with something to make the phones go like that.  All right.  Go ahead, Jason.  All right.  So I used to date this girl down in North Carolina.  And the first couple times, I smelled this cabbage.  I didn't know if it was from her work or something.  I finally took her out.  And it was just this nasty-ass cabbage smell.  I mean, it had nothing to do with her or anything coming from any orifice.  She just had that cabbage smell.  Okay, okay, okay, okay.  Look, there are certain medical conditions that women have.  There's this one that they emanate the smell of fish. 
[02:20:30]  And it's not just, you know, the normal ha-ha, that old gag.  But they're like from out of every pore, pretty much.  So there are medical problems maybe that make certain girls smell bad.  But I'm talking your average, healthy girl, they smell good.  I think girls smell pretty.  They should?  You're crazy.  No.  You're generalizing.  Yes, in general, girls smell pretty, of course.  And I think every guy smells horrific.  How many guys have you smelled?  Just, I'm talking passing by in a hallway. 
[02:21:00]  You know the, you know people wake?  You ever get the people wake?  Yep.  I hold my breath for people wake.  What's people wake?  It's like, you ever see a boat going through the water?  It leaves a wake?  Yeah.  It spreads out?  Yeah.  When someone walks past you, they leave a wake in the air.  And their fragrance is in that wake.  And sometimes I don't want it in my nose.  When they spread their legs?  No, when they walk past you.  There's nothing sexual here.  When they walk past you nude.  Don't even try.  All right, Jason.  Thank you. 
[02:21:30]  Let's go to Dan in Minnesota.  Dan?  Yeah, Dana.  Morning, boys.  Hello.  Oh, man.  Speaking of b-b-b-boys.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, well.  We dropped that for now.  Ick's name on the b-b-boys.  We got an inside source that knows a lot about us.  Of course he can.  Sounds a lot like b-b-b-b-b-b.  Nah, whatever.  For another day, trust me.  Go ahead, Dan.  Well, I had a girlfriend in high school who was smoking hot and rich to boot.  And when we would kiss, the air that came out of our nose stank like hell. 
[02:22:00]  It was probably out of sinus infection.  I wanted to put my nose in her ass after that just to get rid of her face.  How was her breath?  Her breath was fine.  She smoked, but I thought it had.  But the nose stank was just too much to deal with.  She probably had just like a rotting cyst in there.  Maybe she had something, a big booger that's been in there for like weeks.  Probably like a rotting, leaking cyst.  Or just there was a sinus condition, which is even more disgusting because, I mean, she  has it all the time. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  Caked boogers.  All right.  Before we move on, we're going to go to Jeff in Michigan.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, man.  I got this crazy ability.  I can walk through any place and pick out a woman that's on her period.  I can smell it.  Jesus Christ.  What are you, Riddick?  No, he can...  From Pitch Black?  He can smell the tears of the husband.  You really can...  Wow, we might have to like get this guy to do this for us.  No, the twat whisperer.  Well, that's a hell of a talent. 
[02:23:00]  How close do you have to get?  Oh, man.  I can be within a bar and pick them out from...  No fucking way.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm a freaking DJ.  And I can just tell when somebody's in season, we'll say.  In season.  Wow.  Listen to you.  All right, Jeff.  Like a hunter.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You got a really...  Let's just say a one in four chance of being right, I think.  Or no, is it one in 30?  I don't know what the chances are that a woman...  Because a woman's on a period for a week.  One in 28.  So every woman...  Yeah, that's true.  So every woman you have a 25% chance with.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, you get a group of girls in a room.  And we've found this out just through trial and error on this show.  You get a group of women in a room, and one of them at least will be on her period.  Yeah.  There'll be a string-hiding fucking party going on.  Absolutely.  Just happened last week.  With the penthouse girls.  Yep.  One of them was...  What was it called?  Place on Ground Light Fuse Getaway.  There was a tampon check?  Tampon check.  Yeah, a tampon check.  I want to make sure her string was tucked. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, we got lots to do today over here at XM.  We got a homeless man breaks into church to use phone to call phone sex hotline.  It's terrific.  We got a high school couple using school laptop to make and send porno.  This is terrific.  Assistant cheerleading coach fired for drinking and taking topless photo with high school.  Oh, shit.  When are these fuckers going to learn?  So we got three good ones there.  Where are the people that are just getting away with this?  There has to be people that are like going, holy shit. 
[02:24:30]  Look, another one got caught.  I've been getting away with this for years.  Yeah.  And some people, I guess, go to their grave getting away with it.  Yeah, I think, well, he's not dead, but I think my, well, one of my coaches in high school got away with it for many years.  Oh, no.  I told you about the peephole in his office.  What did he do to you?  To me?  Oh, I thought you were going to say he touched you.  Take pictures.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no pictures, but check your spine.  Did he know?  And I, and I don't know, straighten it out. 
[02:25:00]  In all fairness, I don't know if he put the hole there, but it was, it was well known that  in the coach's office, there was a hole that led to the, the, the, the window.  Oh, stop it.  The girl showers.  Really?  And it was behind a cork board that had all the schedules.  So you just had to move it.  Huge hole.  Huge hole.  How'd they not see it back in?  I have no idea, man, but we spent a lot of time watching girls, like, walk around the locker room naked. 
[02:25:30]  I've admitted this on the show many times.  Nice.  Absolutely.  Along with that.  It was, uh, one of the perks of being the coach's assistant.  It was just there.  I have no idea if, if this particular coach actually put the hole there, but certainly.  Could have been a student, no?  Another coach's assistant.  And I'll say this much too.  I never did it with him in the room.  Well, I hope not.  Yeah.  What are you guys going to do?  It'll be creepy.  You and the coach is jerking off together.  Come on, gather the way I'm close. 
[02:26:00]  But I think it was passed down.  I think it was one of these things that was just passed down.  It was passed down from, uh, from student to student to student.  Sure.  It probably was put up there in the 70s.  I'm sure some tattletale has ruined it.  Oh, I'm sure.  Me, by talking about it on the radio.  Everyone knows where I went to high school.  Oh, you want to, so you want to do cheerleading, uh, coach, or you want to do, uh, Jill TV thing?  We got to do all this stuff today.  I know, we got a lot of stuff.  Well, there was also this phone sex thing in church.  Yeah, we'll do that as well, Jimmy.  Uh, but first we got Scott in. 
[02:26:30]  How dare people do that.  In, uh, San Fran-  San Fran-tastic.  San Fran-  Francisco.  Mmm.  Scott, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, fuck, I love you guys, man.  Hey, thank you.  Speaking of San Francisco, uh, coming soon to the Opium Anthem show, probably as early as tomorrow.  Uh, it, it, it's been brought to my attention, it was never played on the XM, uh, side.  What?  Marco Eats Pussy.  Wow.  It was never played on XM, supposedly. 
[02:27:00]  It's a classic.  It is a classic.  Gay guy eating pussy for NSYNC tickets, I think it was?  An XM world premiere.  Yeah, we're going to have a world premiere tomorrow.  Marco Eats the Peach for, I think, was it NSYNC?  Thumbs up, down?  Not sure.  We should get a straight guy to suck a dick for something.  I mean, something really good.  Like fucking, uh.  Hey, Scott, what do you got from the show?  No, no, no, no, no, no, hold on.  Hey.  That would be fucking.  All right, hold on, Scott, hold on.  Wait a minute.  That would be great radio.  Count me in. 
[02:27:30]  Exactly.  I'll do it, I'll do it for a free lunch.  But how do you know you're getting a straight guy?  Well, there's, again, that's.  How do you know it's not a gay guy?  Gay guy.  Yeah.  Acting straight to win, like, because the prize would be ridiculous.  Yeah, that's a good point.  We have to have a married guy or something like that.  I don't know.  With his wife watching or something.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is this turning into?  To confirm it.  Kids in the other room being babysit.  I mean, we have to prove that this guy's straight.  Yeah.  Well, there goes Giuliani's fucking presidency.  Why?  What happened?  There goes Pat Robertson endorsing him. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, boy.  Now, he needs that, though, for the religious conservatives.  Does he?  Yes, he does, because he's pro-choice.  So the religious conservatives don't really like him.  Yeah, but I think there are other candidates that the religious conservatives would go for  other than Rudy.  Right.  So I think he should probably steer away from that and try to bring over some moderate Democrats.  And, you know, he should take the middle-of-the-road approach.  I think this Pat Robertson thing is going to hurt him with people that take him as kind  of a moderate, not right-wing kind of a guy, but we'll see. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  I just think it's...  I think this hurts.  I'm scared.  All right.  Let's say hi to Scott in San Francisco.  Scott, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, fuckers.  Hey.  I fucking...  I got pink eye from eating an asshole one time.  Did you have brown eye?  You got pink eye...  Damn it.  I got pink eye from eating the brown eye.  Yeah, I got all thick and viscous-y liquid right now that spit all filled up.  Got it in my eye, and I remember I had to wash it out. 
[02:29:00]  Dude, what?  Shit came...  Like, viscous-y stuff came out and went in your eye?  I don't...  I just...  I gathered so much saliva in the asshole...  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Let me tell you what that was.  That was the cum of the guy before you.  Oof.  I don't...  You got the cum of the other guy sprayed into your eye as you're eating.  Look, look. 
[02:29:30]  Ass.  I like ass.  I don't like cock.  But then again...  Right.  So you said so much spit got built up that the muscles must have contracted and...  Yeah, it got in my eye, and I remember...  I remember I kept being a bit of allergy season, so my eyes were getting all fucked up.  And that bitch kicked me out.  The squirting carnation.  I know.  Exactly.  Put some primatine mist in there.  Fucking...  Put some whatever they use for your eye.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Vizine.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  With improv.  With some whatever they use for your eye.  I don't like a fucking cancer on the lung of fun.  On the lung of fun.  I remember I was doing a gig Friday night.  I do comedy too, Jimmy.  Oh, cool, man.  And I was doing a gig Friday night, and then my eyes started to crush shut.  And I was like, well, this ain't fucking good.  I got pink eye in front of a crowd of 100 people.  Well, I had it one time, too, on Tough Crowd.  It was legitimately the pink eye.  And fucking stupid Colin acted like I had the bubonic plague. 
[02:30:30]  Get away from me!  It's very contagious, Jimmy.  You afraid to diet plan, fatso?  It's very contagious, though.  Ah, big deal.  I'm not going to rub my eye on him.  You never know.  Yeah, and I gave, like, three open micers pink eye.  I was like, sorry there.  Sorry there, Junior.  Oh, you're hitting the mic with your eye?  Exactly, that big closing bit you do where you pretend it's a fucking periscope.  It would look something like this.  Let's pretend I was Galileo.  And so, I just said, last night I was eating asshole, I got pink eye. 
[02:31:00]  And then it rolled my shoulders, and I went to myself and got off.  Hey, are you getting your material from movies?  Because this wasn't knocked up.  Oh, was it?  No, I don't get material from movies.  Liar, liar.  You might be a liar.  Hands eye on fire.  All right, thank you, Scott.  Scott, the comedian from San Francisco.  Where are you going to be performing, Scott?  I'm at Rooster Teeth Brothers in Sunnyvale, where Rich Voss will be this weekend.  Wow.  That's where Rich is going to be.  Dual plug.  Getting to work with the great Rich Voss. 
[02:31:30]  When he's not busy walking the red carpet with what?  Backstreet Boys, was it?  For what?  For what?  We found a picture of Rich Voss on the red carpet with the Backstreet Boys.  No.  From when?  On another station site.  Was it Z100?  Watch your mic off.  Yeah, there's photos of Rich Voss hanging out with the Backstreet Boys at a Z100 event.  Yuck.  Eric, were you talking into a mic that was off?  No.  He was...  No.  During the year, okay.  I didn't think so.  All right.  Sometimes you'll hear me react to something.  It's because E-Rock's feeding me all my lines. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, that's just...  Sorry to hear that.  Wow.  That explains it.  Every once in a while we'll be talking and be going, all right, coming up, I'm hungry.  He must go through all of the words.  Yeah.  Never mind.  See how that hurts?  Yeah.  Hold on.  It really does.  Wow.  It really does hurt.  You had no confidence as you shouldn't have.  And then you took a sip right after.  I was like...  What?  What happened?  I was late? 
[02:32:30]  All right.  I think he goes through all the...  Words that I...  Fuck.  Here's the cheerleading coach...  Assistant cheerleading...  Assistant cheerleading coach story.  It's playoff night at Goshen High School, but both the football team and cheerleaders are  tonight without assistant coaches.  We have to be the right role models, and that is exactly what we expect from our employees.  Goshen School Superintendent Charlene Thomas says the school board today fired 19-year-old  assistant coach Andrew Emerson for hosting a party, and 19-year-old freshman cheerleader 
[02:33:00]  coach Victoria Shutower for allegedly providing alcohol to a freshman at the party.  The school says Shutower took this partially nude picture with that freshman.  You know what?  Yikes.  But the assistant coach was 19.  What was the other age?  15.  They're both in high school.  I think.  15 or 16.  Yeah, but there's a certain ethical thing there.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Yeah, but that's why you probably shouldn't hire young teachers.  They're too close in age to the kids.  It's a little hot and everything, but...  Yeah, how do you not? 
[02:33:30]  Ethical.  How do you not sink your cock into the young pussies?  I mean, forgive my terminologist.  I mean, you gotta take a peek if you're a young student.  Dude, I jerked off to every fucking teacher I had, like female.  Good thing to you.  And there were a couple of awful ones.  My social studies teacher literally looked like a horse.  Really?  A fucking horse.  I had a math teacher who dressed like an Amish woman.  She had no sex appeal at all.  She had the sex appeal of fucking headphones. 
[02:34:00]  And why would you spank to them?  Because my dick was bored with everyone else on the Rolodex.  I had to somehow...  Wow.  I used to see the crack of the ass, and if the cheeks were, like, well-defined in the  pants, I jerked off to it.  And it was back in the day when, like, the wind would blow, you would get a hard-on, so  you had to take care of this shit.  And there was no pornography.  I had a hot French teacher I jerked off to.  Me too.  Thank you, Jimmy, for reminding me.  I had a really ugly old typing teacher.  I did it once to her.  Yeah.  Never to teach her. 
[02:34:30]  Never.  And a lot of the women I used to caddy for that were old, but they were wearing skirts.  Yeah.  And you'd probably fantasize about them going, here's your tip, young Greg, and parting  their skirt while you gave their thighs a little kissy-poo.  Teach you the meaning of the word respect.  We had someone that we used to caddy for, that she would do the old peekaboo and stuff.  She was a much older lady.  Oh, I fucking like that shit.  And rumor has it that, it was a strong rumor that she liked this one caddy in particular,  and she was banging him on the golf course in the woods and stuff. 
[02:35:00]  Danny Noonan?  Swear to God.  And she had to be...  I'll just keep going.  I know.  I know.  Don't even try to stop me.  Caddy was probably early 20s.  She was probably, safe to say, 50.  Oh.  Safe to say.  If she wasn't 75.  Nah, nah.  That'd be nice.  Did you loofah her stretch marks?  Her pussy lips look like an elephant's trunk.  That fucking, the little skin on the end, they're like kind of hardened.  The thing that holds the peanuts. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That they put in their mouth.  The little piece that kind of goes up and down, it goes, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.  You can almost feel it.  I would love to get my dick sucked by an elephant's trunk.  I want to fucking put baby oil.  I want to put baby oil in an elephant's trunk and have him just go, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.  And my fucking dick in his stupid nostrils.  There was that day the guy from Long Island had a baby elephant in a truck downstairs, but we couldn't get the elephant upstairs.  So your dream almost came true.  We had tigers in here that day.  And tigers and stuff.  Hey, uh, Rich Voss. 
[02:36:00]  What's going on?  Hey, Voss.  Hi, Rich.  Why are you calling me this early?  Why are you?  This early?  We want to know how your evening with the Backstreet Boys was.  What are you talking about?  We're looking at a website.  There's Rich Voss hanging out with the Backstreet Boys.  Why would you be looking at that?  Rich Voss at the Backstreet Boys party.  First of all, why would you be looking at that?  Where did you get that from?  And why would you care about that?  You're not answering questions, Rich.  Why would we care about that?  We don't care about it.  We find it humiliating for you. 
[02:36:30]  You know, maybe I like certain bands.  It doesn't matter who, you know.  You don't like the Backstreet Boys.  Was it for your kids?  Yeah, I took my...  Oh, you let them off the hook.  Oh, he would have said that.  No, he wouldn't.  Okay, I'm sorry.  He's not that smart.  When did this happen, you're queer?  Last week.  Last week.  Was it?  Yeah, last week I took them...  Well, my one daughter bailed out, but I took my...  Of course she did.  It's too gay.  No.  Of course.  What do you mean it's gay?  It's not...  It's gay... 
[02:37:00]  It's not gay if you're a 17-year-old girl.  No, but it's gay to have your...  She felt bad for you.  She's like, I can't believe my dad's a mo.  A mo.  That's great.  Whose daughter bailed out?  The older or younger one?  The younger one.  See, she's embarrassed.  The older one's kind of resigned to the fact, look, I'm his firstborn, I've got to defend  him and tolerate him.  No, listen to me.  Listen to me.  She asked me to get her Backstreet Boy ticket.  No, she didn't.  She was a beard for you. 
[02:37:30]  You had to say, look, I've got to bring my daughter just so you wouldn't look like a  fruit going by yourself.  Boy, you are really holding this call together because they made a big mistake on this one.  Oh, let's see.  We could transfer for a Backstreet Boy picture.  I took my daughter and the worst part about it is...  Are you guys still listening?  Yes.  And that's the worst part about it.  Let's see.  We had to take pictures four at a time.  Holy mother.  What's that?  Jesus.  Okay, let me see that.  We're...  I don't know.  Four at a time, Rich. 
[02:38:00]  Four people at a time?  Yeah.  And I didn't want to break up my daughter and her friend.  So there was three people, then my daughter, her friend, and two other people.  So I jumped in with the other people.  That's why I took a picture with them.  Yeah, there's trouble.  What's that?  Nothing.  What?  Can I see it?  We're looking at illegal pictures.  No.  Oh.  It's a joke, Rich.  Well, Rich, why do you sound tired?  Why do I sound tired?  Did you just wake up? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, what a fatty.  Nice fat arms, kid.  Oh, that's the coach.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I'm squeezing my dick.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Can we...  That's not yours.  I'm looking at Chris Angel.  That's what that girl looks like with a fucking black hair.  She's like, Chris Angel.  Why don't we destroy those pictures?  Now, Rich, why are you tired?  Why are you fucking nice tits?  Why are they...  No, it's fine.  Yeah?  Is it college?  All right, then destroy them. 
[02:39:00]  Rich.  Yeah.  You sound tired.  Did you just wake up?  Well, I got up earlier to have some waffles, so I went back to bed.  Yeah.  How's your daughter doing?  I miss you.  Daughter?  Rich?  Fine.  Rich?  How's your daughter doing?  Ugh.  How's the baby?  Oh, great.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  We welcome you.  How's the baby?  We'll talk to you soon, all right?  Yeah, thanks, Rich.  Was I supposed to do something? 
[02:39:30]  No, that's just it.  Well, maybe entertain would be nice.  What do you think you dogged the bounty hunter?  Dogged the job hunter.  First of all, are you guys, I'm supposed to entertain?  You wake me up and talk about a picture.  You're supposed to, I don't know, like contribute or participate a little in the program?  Well, first of all, wait a second.  I guess we made the right decision.  It's spur of the moment.  It's like, you know, you're...  Okay, let's make a Backstreet Boy picture funny. 
[02:40:00]  Hey, first of all, I just woke up.  You were used first of all.  You're up to third of all.  Or possibly fourth of all.  You have a lot of first of alls.  You certainly do.  I just woke up.  Yeah.  Some guys, you go, tell me about the Backstreet Boys.  And what am I supposed to do?  Start tap dancing?  Why not?  It's fun.  I like to dance.  Okay.  You probably didn't mind dancing with them.  Five of you probably did like a little thing.  Uh, did you?  Yes, I did. 
[02:40:30]  I slow danced with, I don't know their names, but this one.  Which Backstreet Boy do you find attractive?  Uh, the one with the...  Well, one of them had a little good personality and had a little humor.  So I kind of liked him.  He's a little blonde-haired young boy.  Younger looking one.  You contribute nothing.  I know, except the truth.  You're really contributing nothing today.  Why don't you tell us facts now?  Well, first of all...  No, you can't first of all.  First of all, home. 
[02:41:00]  I think you're up to fifth of all.  If I was in studio, it would be a little funnier.  It would be a little...  I almost...  I turned my shoulders gay when I said that.  It would be a little funnier.  Well, we know what part we could cut out of the replay today.  Continue, Rich.  At least they'll only hear this once today.  Yeah.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  You know, you make me look like the band... 
[02:41:30]  The beauty of having your own channel...  Mm-hmm.  People won't even know that you called if they listen at 3 o'clock.  This is...  You are no replay boss.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  They won't replay my Backstreet Boy interview.  What?  Wait, so if they don't replay this, the people won't know.  That'll be at the brokerage next weekend.  All right.  The bo-kerage?  The brokerage.  The brokerage.  What a fool.  The brokerage next weekend.  All right.  Now, listen.  I'll talk to you guys later, but it was a good party with the Backstreet Boys. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  I wish you guys could have been there.  Look, first of all...  Why didn't you invite us, shit dick?  Because you were up in Boston.  Oh.  No, I wasn't.  I was here.  Did you get a lot of...  I was here.  I didn't go to Boston.  Did you get a lot of recognition at the event?  Two people.  No one recognized me.  All right.  Here's the second part of the...  He's an older man.  ...story.  This is still a little bit early in the investigation, but whatever measures have to be taken that  is appropriate, either with eligibility, disciplinary measures, those will be taken by our high school 
[02:42:30]  administration.  He's my stepfather.  The cheerleader coach's stepfather tells me tonight he did not know about the incident,  but says he's very disappointed with his daughter's actions.  The mother of the freshman in the picture told me she had no comment tonight.  Meanwhile, parents with kids in the school are shocked.  I mean, I would hope that parents would talk to their kids and, you know, it's not something  that should be passed around and it's not something definitely that shouldn't be going through  a high school or happening in a high school at all.  It's cool. 
[02:43:00]  No, this stuff is happening like crazy.  Who cares?  Pictures are being passed around high schools like crazy.  Two chicks and their big tits.  Big deal.  Now with the camera phones.  Yeah.  Imagine having...  Imagine if every friggin' student in your school, when you were going to school, had  a camera all the time.  Yeah.  Please.  What you'd be doing.  Those upskirt shots.  Everything.  Oh my God.  I forgot about that.  That guy the other day that took the picture of the girl.  The upskirt.  Oh, this guy's a gem. 
[02:43:30]  It's obviously wrong, but it's also kind of hilarious.  What this guy was like just a...  Did they find this guy?  I don't know.  We never got to this the other day, but Walmart perf takes upskirt cell picture of 13-year-old  girl.  13-year-old girl is like shopping and reaching for stuff and the guy, he was a smooth operator  I'll tell you.  How they know you're taking pictures.  Walks up the aisle, stops, bends down, quick camera phone pic, and then goes to the girl, 
[02:44:00]  thank you, and walks out.  Yeah.  Maybe you should shut up.  You can't see the victim, but the 13-year-old girl is wearing a skirt and standing on the  right-hand side of the deodorant aisle at Walmart.  Watch this fellow.  He's bald and he's got big stripes on his sleeves.  He spots the girl, leans down, puts his camera phone right between her legs, then snaps  his photo.  She does feel something touch her inner thigh.  Jesus.  She hears the click.  She hears the click and she immediately turns around. 
[02:44:30]  And he says something.  He tells her, thank you, sweetheart, as he looked her dead in the eye.  Oof.  It's amazing to me.  Thank you, sweetheart.  Hey, really fast.  Can we take this audio and play the bleep game?  I hear a lot of bleep for this one.  Yes.  This could be a gem.  Yes, Jimmy?  I just don't know why that's news.  Like, some asshole.  Yeah.  Maybe he knew how old she was.  Maybe she didn't.  But that's, like, news now.  Guy took a cell phone picture.  Even though it's a scumbag move.  Yeah, it is.  But it's amazing what we're reporting is real new. 
[02:45:00]  Who gives a fuck?  It's not news.  Just find him, smash his teeth with a nightstick, and move on.  The victim, who was very bold and smart, immediately told her older sister what happened.  They raced to the front of the store, where they see this guy walking out.  So that gave her another opportunity to get a better clothing description, a better description  of him, to give to us.  Mount Dora is a small, quaint place.  News of the camera phone cataphyl made fun. 
[02:45:30]  Who's voice is, it's fucking terrible?  Oh, blah, blah, blah.  This town, blah, blah.  Ugh.  What a voice.  The bar is a small, quaint place.  Quaint place.  News of the camera phone pedophile made folks sick to their stomach.  Well, quite frankly, I just think they should open Alcatraz and put them all there.  What?  That's my reaction.  Alcatraz?  It's terrible.  What else should they do that's fucking topical?  The gulag, maybe?  What the hell is she saying?  They should push him in Auschwitz. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Get him an Alcatraz, see?  What the hell?  It's curtains for you.  Cell phone pedophile curtains.  And they give him a name.  He's the cell phone pedophile.  Maybe he didn't know how old she was.  He just saw an ass and took a picture.  Cell phone pedophile.  The cell phone baby rapist Democrat.  Jesus, how do you know all this?  That's Tim's wife?  Yes.  Very good there.  That's Trash.  Trash.  Very good.  There you go.  The cell phone.  Should lock him up in the Bastille. 
[02:46:30]  Exactly.  Put him in a cell with Papillon.  Fucking Devil's Island for him.  Oh my God.  What an idiot.  They should throw him in the brig on the Santa Maria.  Let's play the bleep game with this.  Let's see what Sam can do with that one.  If it's not good, then no worries.  Hey, we've got to take a quick break.  When we get back, Jill TV wants Ant and I and Jimmy to lip sync to some dumb promo they're doing. 
[02:47:00]  And they actually gave us the song and the lyrics.  The song and lyrics.  And we're supposed to lip sync and then we're going to be put in like in clips with a bunch  of people around New York lip syncing.  They don't know the show.  These things.  And all I was thinking is.  Our fans would kill us if they see us on Channel 11.  Fans?  My family.  Yeah, your family.  I'm doing it.  I think it's fun and it's good for the image, boys.  You're lying.  Please shut up. 
[02:47:30]  What's the lyrics, Hope?  Let's hear the lyrics.  Well.  I want to hear the music because the lyrics just sound great.  You want to break first?  All right, we're going to break and then I'll tell you what the lyrics are, Jimmy.  And I actually got the song.  It's called This Is The Place.  Sounds fun.  Hey, isn't this great?  It starts with natural sound.  Noise of the control room.  The footsteps.  OD.  The cameraman.  Door opens and closes into the studio.  Music begins.  The coffee rush on the morning ride.  The salt and sand at the ocean side. 
[02:48:00]  Is this how the tune goes?  A hot dog on your way downtown.  The city breathes and it makes one sound.  It's the sound of the neighborhood.  Oh, yes it is.  The kids running in the park barefoot.  I like that.  Is that how it goes?  Broadway.  Come on, people.  Let me hear you say.  From the city to the open sky.  This is the place.  This is the family for you and I.  This is the place.  And we are the people.  New York.  Let me hear you.  And this is the place.  From the river to the open wide. 
[02:48:30]  This is the place.  Where the heart and soul beat in time.  This is the place.  And we are the people.  New York.  And this is the place to live.  Wow.  Jimmy will do his rendition after the break.  Oh, no, Jimmy won't.  Jill Nicolini.  Yes, you will.  Look what she's doing to my weenie.  Right.  Yeah, we're going to change the words.  Now it's hard.  Although, unfortunately, it's still teeny.  Maybe she'll rub it just like a genie.  And then make the inside of my underpants all wet and creamy. 
[02:49:00]  Sorry, my glasses are steamy.  Go ahead.  You can look and see me, but you wouldn't want to be me.  Put on a strap on and ream me.  That's right.  Open and can double team me.  Oh, we'll play the actual song next.  We got twins invent wedgie proof underwear.  We got that audio.  We're going to play the bleep game.  We got the high school couple using the school laptop to make and send porno. 
[02:49:30]  And the guy in the church.  I want to talk about the man in the church.  Okay, we'll do that next, Jimmy.  Hey.  I don't think they should.  You think they're going to take a break soon?  I don't know.  I hope so, because I got to pee.  Hey.  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do you?  It's all about me.  Is it?  I was assaulted.  Were you?  We're brilliant broadcasters. 
[02:50:00]  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  That sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did you?  It's the OB and Anthony show.  Is it?  Oh, God damn.  One of our favorite things of all time.  Maury.  Fuck the radio show today.  Go to Maury Povich.  Holy shit.  He's got the primordial dwarfs back.  It's like, I don't know, look back. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, I think it's just a promo, I think.  It was like a short Helen Hunt.  But he showed he was promoing it with...  I don't know.  It's not a promo.  It's going on forever.  It's this one primordial dwarf that Maury fell in love with, and they're showing every  one of her appearances.  They're up to the fifth appearance.  The fourth appearance was when he played hide and seek with her and her friends, where  he had them hide in the bookshelf behind the coffee maker in a drawer, a desk drawer.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  That's how small these things are.  Oh, you're behind the coffee maker, you little freak.  Oh, my God.  Is she coming back out now?  I think, yeah, here she is.  She's a cheerleader.  She's a cheerleader.  Get me this audio.  How do I get this up?  Wait, Maury?  All right, Maury.  We'll go with Maury.  We'll do a little simulcast here.  You've only been on for 10 years?  10 years of Maury.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hi, Jackie.  How are you, dude?  How are you?  Hi. 
[02:51:30]  You're the one that gave birth to this.  How's that womb of yours?  Boy, I can't talk to you like a little girl anymore.  You know that.  How old are you?  68.  12.  12.  12.  You've grown up.  Not only in age, you've grown taller.  I'm about three feet.  Yeah.  She's what?  I don't know.  Three feet, something?  She looks like a coal miner's daughter.  Are you cheerleaders?  Sissy Spacek?  She's a cheerleader.  Oh, she's a cheerleader. 
[02:52:00]  She's a cheerleader.  Stop it.  Give me a G.  Give me a U.  Give me an N.  Now you do a cheer.  Kelly, your sister's going to help you, right?  Right.  Are you going to start it?  Okay.  Hey, cheerleaders.  Hey, Ma.  Hey, cheerleaders.  Her sister's hot.  Shake your booty.  Oh.  No way.  Shake your booty.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  No.  Yeah.  Shake your booty.  Stop that.  It's not a good cheerleader.  Why are they making a little freak dwarf shake her ass? 
[02:52:30]  Oh, boy.  You are something.  She's not a good cheerleader.  Can we get a 12-year-old freak dwarf to shake her ass?  Did you have a favorite actress-singer?  Who is that?  Hannah Montana.  Hannah Montana.  Who's that?  We've got surprises for you, Hannah.  A surprise for you.  We have a picture.  Every single Hannah Montana item on the show.  Oh, my God.  Item.  Item.  Item.  Thanks, Maury.  Basically, what Maury's saying, look, Hannah Montana didn't think you were important enough 
[02:53:00]  to us here.  You frightened her.  Right.  Look at that.  So, we just got some stuff from Walmart for you.  Yeah.  You think that's good?  Listen to this.  Uh-oh.  We found out that Hannah Montana is coming to your hometown in Minnesota, and her concert  is sold out.  No tickets.  Ah, ah, ah.  We pulled the strings, and you're going to go to the Hannah Montana show next week.  Hannah Montana sounds like a porn star. 
[02:53:30]  Sure it does.  So, just in case you don't know what I'm trying to say here.  Hannah Montana.  Oh.  Didn't think this was important enough.  Look at those Danny Torrance teeth.  Primordial teeth should be fixed.  How are some primordial braces?  Yeah, really.  God almighty.  Nice up-the-skirt shot.  Ooh.  Ten years on this program.  Oh, shut up, you.  Broadcasting.  Dried-up twat.  Maury, you are not the baby daddy. 
[02:54:00]  I know you say.  You are not the baby daddy.  Maury, you're not the baby daddy.  If my math is correct, Maury, you're not the baby daddy.  I get it.  It's so bad.  Oh, the view is just terrific.  Over the last few years, we've met a lot of special guests.  Today, we'll see them again, live and in person.  By special.  The guests who have made us laugh are the guests who have made us cry. 
[02:54:30]  Some of our guests have literally grown up before our odds.  They're back to help us celebrate our 10th anniversary.  It's only 10 years.  Why don't we think Maury Colpice is on for longer?  Oh.  Give me a big smile.  What's happened?  Got married.  Got married.  Dude, does she have a vagina?  She's a torso with hands.  It's half a woman.  And not the good half.  Maury.  Maury.  The part with the head.  No, the icky part.  The icky part.  If there was any god, it would just be two legs and a cunt with a nice ass behind it. 
[02:55:00]  And a fucking cowboy's hat on.  She's got big boobs, though.  She has huge cans.  Huge cans that were dragging on the floor because she has no lower half.  But it stops at the bottom of her rib cage is where her body just cut off and she's walking on her hands.  What?  What happens to the shit?  Where does the doody go?  Where does her shit go?  Ew.  Steve, where does her shit go?  Steve.  Steve. 
[02:55:30]  Comment?  You know a little something about the digestive system and how to abuse it?  Yeah.  I would assume into a baggie, perhaps?  Oh, maybe she uses a bag.  Yeah, a colostomy bag, maybe.  Oh, she must be a grand.  What a fucking fun wedding that must have been.  Sexy.  Ugh.  Her hands are always dirty because she's stepping on the dirt and the ground.  Yeah.  She can't even jerk you off because she has little crushed glass in her fucking rough hands and her rough half a person hands.  Why not just feet and a cunt with maybe two eyes above the cliff so they can see like a Spongebob? 
[02:56:00]  Why do we have to have the top half of the woman?  You know, the one that talks and thinks and disagrees and pesters and nags and can still PMS.  But then again, that is true.  If you had just had the bottom half, you'd get the period and then it's either ass fucking or I just hang you upside down in the closet because you're of no value at all.  Two ears, one ear on each hip so you can hear me going, shut up.  How about that? 
[02:56:30]  With a fucking nice dumper.  Yeah, but the wedding must have just been.  How does the father walk that out?  I know.  Well, he probably couldn't wait to get rid of it.  He probably ran it down the aisle.  Sorry, you're two weeks early.  I know.  Can we just leave her here?  Tucked under his arm like a football.  He's just knocking people out of the way.  And then he spiked her in front of the husband.  She's your burden now.  Oh, he couldn't wait to give her away.  He probably just threw her.  He got like within eight feet of the altar and tossed her. 
[02:57:00]  He's yours.  Got to go.  Take care.  He's got to fucking his bag with him to get on a flight and leave.  Moving to an apartment on the 50th floor with no elevator.  Exactly.  He took her out with the garbage.  He made two trips.  How does she drive?  I don't know how she would do anything.  How does she fucking do sit-ups?  We're going to find out, Jimmy.  Big tits.  Yeah, big tits.  But Sam is back.  The bleep game.  Or the beep game.  Whatever.  I like to say bleep.  Some people like to say beep.  What do you like?  Beep or bleep? 
[02:57:30]  Let's call the whole thing off.  All right.  Sounds good.  I like the sound removal game.  Well, yeah, sure.  The sound enhancement game.  How about the eek game?  Yeah.  How about the Sam Shines game?  Ah.  Okay.  All right.  Just studying you.  That's what I thought.  We're on to you, man.  What do you mean?  It's time.  It is time, Sam.  It's time to admit you're black.  Just give me a minute.  We don't care.  Just a little piece.  Anthony will apologize for 8,000 things he said in the fucking office.  Not only are you black, you know where your blackness comes from. 
[02:58:00]  8,000?  You discuss it with your family.  It was like a great uncle or something's happening.  Nothing of the sort.  What about your family?  What about them?  Do they have similar features?  Hair?  I have one uncle on my mom's side.  Well, I remember him.  Who has similar hair.  Okay.  How about this?  When you go to visit dead relatives, do you know where to go?  Or is there no marker? 
[02:58:30]  Thank you, Jimmy.  I do know there are marked graves for most people.  Any relatives' feet facing the Potomac.  They want their feet to face the Potomac, so if they flick a nickel off their ankle, they'll hit the water.  Was that a quarter?  Wasn't it a quarter?  It was a quarter.  Yeah.  Sorry, nickels for faggots.  I probably.  Only big boys do quarters.  Wait, do we go back to this or will we play the beep game?  In 2001.  Now.  And we were right here.  On Half a Woman. 
[02:59:00]  We were ready to tape our show.  Be Half a Woman.  And in fact, for the people around the country, we're about, I don't know, 50 blocks.  Half a bitch.  No more than the World Trade Center.  Half a woman.  Than the World Trade Center.  Yes.  And two weeks after that fateful day, when we met an incredible woman named Jillian, who  came to us searching for her fiancé, Kevin, who won.  No, we ain't.  I ain't going to sit through that.  I don't know what happened with Jillian, though.  We're not sitting through that.  We want Half a Woman.  Jillian's beautiful.  Yeah.  Oh, he obviously died for 9-11.  Yeah.  And she's pretty, man. 
[02:59:30]  All right, listen.  Why don't we play the beep game?  So we did the, what was he called?  The camera phone perv?  Yeah, camera phone pedophile.  Camera phone pedophile.  So we took that audio.  Remember when we just played that audio?  Remember.  Well, now we gave it to Sam.  Sam, are you in charge of the beep game officially?  Officially, yes.  That's your thing?  Yes.  Another bit for you.  Right.  Sam.  I get to tell you when you guys go to break.  Bad boy, Sam.  No one can take that from me. 
[03:00:00]  All right, here we go.  Life sucks.  This is what Sam did with that audio that you heard a little while ago.  You can't see the victim, but the 13-year-old girl is wearing it.  He's wearing a skirt and standing on the right-hand side of the deodorant aisle at Walmart.  Watch this fellow.  He's bald and he's got big stripes on his sleeves.  He spots the girl, leans down, puts his right between her legs, then his right.  She does feel something touch her inner thigh.  She's the c***.  She's the c***.  And she immediately turns around. 
[03:00:30]  And he says something.  He tells her, thank you, sweetheart, as he looked her dead in the eye.  That's not bad.  That ain't bad.  I like it.  I like it, too.  Beat game is still in the back.  It sounded like he put his dick between her legs.  Oh, is that what it is?  That's kind of what I was feeling there.  It's theater of the mind.  It lets you use your imagination to make your own story.  I don't think a lot of people were thinking dick.  No?  No.  I was.  Of course you were.  Jesus.  Ew.  I didn't know we were hanging with Larry Littoral again today. 
[03:01:00]  Hate Larry Littoral.  Why?  Larry Littoral is the straightener outer.  I understand.  He certainly is.  How's your beauty marks?  I have so many.  My girlfriend gave me a new nickname that she likes.  Oh, what is it?  Paddington.  Why Paddington?  I don't know, because I'm bearish.  Paddington bear? 
[03:01:30]  She's been calling me Paddington for two days.  Paddington.  Paddington and cunt.  I'm kidding, of course.  Not that she's cunt.  That's my entire nickname.  Paddington's the short version.  I'm Paddington and cunt.  Jimmy, I gotta tell you.  Oh, half a woman.  Half a woman.  Half a woman next.  All smelly hands.  Take a Barbie doll, and we just pop the legs off.  What's left is, you know, the torso area.  That's what I am.  There's a phrase.  That's called half a body.  Half a body, half a person.  I mean, I mean, who are we to judge if we're half or not? 
[03:02:00]  No, she says she's got.  And that's what makes the pussy.  Oh, shut up.  But she's fucking like a real torso.  She says it's like a Barbie doll that you pull the legs off of.  But I think she's been walking on her snatch for so long.  Six weeks old.  That it's like.  What?  A baby.  She had a baby.  She has a pussy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  Horizontal.  What?  After that shocking revelation, later on in that show, David had a surprise for his girlfriend,  Rose Marie.  I'm leaving you. 
[03:02:30]  I'm fucking nervous.  For a taller woman.  He left her for a top dancer.  Did you marry me?  Whoa.  It's with him.  Hey, if that's a no-brainer.  What is she going to say?  Did you hear his voice?  And surprised her with a wedding shower.  And shortly after that, Rose Marie came back again with some very big news.  Take a look.  I see a big smile.  What's happened?  Guess what?  Got married.  We have a little video of your wedding. 
[03:03:00]  Very little.  Oh, my God.  Look at the little bright.  You could just kick her down the aisle.  That's awful.  David and I exchanged vows and our rings.  Then it was time for our first kiss.  We're posing for pictures with our wedding party.  Stand up.  It was time for the reception.  I did it.  Oh.  Oof.  And then I got my first pair of shoes.  And I didn't know what to do.  So I filled them with whipped cream and licked it out.  I've seen Rose Marie.  And guess what?  She's here today.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Wait a minute.  Oh, here we go.  Half a woman. 
[03:03:30]  Here she comes.  That's what they do.  They give her a standing ovation.  Yeah.  That's lovely.  She's got huge, huge.  She's walking down the stairs.  Huge, huge.  Giant tits that are almost rubbing on the ground as she walks on her hands.  She probably has A-cups.  All pussy drags.  Wow.  Look at how she flipped herself right up there.  It looks like she's poking herself through a whack-a-mole hole.  Play whack-a-thing.  Dude, she drags her twat on the ground over curbs.  Oh my, her pussy must just be flat.  It's got to be a flat pussy. 
[03:04:00]  It looks like somebody on a motorcycle who slid face-first.  Look right over here, ladies and gentlemen.  All this time over.  That's the son?  Wow.  Poor kid.  Oh boy.  Poor kid.  For the potato sack race.  He puts her in.  Let's close her in the river.  So how are you doing?  Doing good.  Settled into marriage, you know.  Been married 10 years now.  Settled in.  That's never good.  Yeah.  Now, there's one little missing piece of this puck. 
[03:04:30]  Oh no, there's two long ones.  They're called legs.  What is there?  We have a Shelby.  What's a Shelby, a kid?  A Shelby will be two in January.  That she can never drive.  We're a horse.  You have a favorite band, right?  That lasts out of four times.  What's your favorite band?  Rascal Flats.  Do you know something?  They're not here.  My son's favorite band.  So.  Whoopity do it.  The Rascal Flats, we understand.  Flat like your mom's vagina.  In Colorado.  It looks like a wax lips that have been punched. 
[03:05:00]  You knew and your family to lose your Rascal Flats.  This kid couldn't be more excited if mom was actually towering above him.  We've been there in 2008.  I'm going to insult to mom that his favorite band is Rascal Flats.  Oh, thanks so much.  It would be special in our hearts.  Luke.  What's your favorite band?  The Legless Humiliations?  We'll be back right after this.  That was great.  I'm Jay.  Joe Don.  Your favorite band in America.  Absolutely. 
[03:05:30]  Rascal Flats.  Congratulations, Maury, on 10 incredible years.  We love you.  Ah, whatever.  The Rascal Flats.  Why the fuck couldn't we do a promo for Maury?  Yeah.  Why couldn't we get the Rascal Flats?  Get fucking Maury on the phone.  Maury, we could have done a video thing like, hey, Maury, congratulations on 10 years of  dragging freaks out on your stage.  Yeah, get Maury on the phone.  I want the Rascal Flats in studio.  Instead, we get offered this.  The coffee rush on the morning ride.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  The soap and sand at the ocean side. 
[03:06:00]  Nice.  A hot dog on your way downtown.  The city breathes and it's making one sound.  It's the sound of the neighborhood.  The kids running in the park barefoot.  Out on the island, the Bronx and Broadway.  Come on, people, let me hear you say.  From the city to the open sky.  This is the family for you and I.  This is the place.  We are the people.  We are the people. 
[03:06:30]  We are the people.  This is the place.  From the river to the open wide.  This is the place.  Where the heart and soul are beating tight.  We are the people.  This is the place to live.  Oh, that's really a nice song.  And they want us to...  They want us to lip sync to that and then we'll be intercut with other people that are  lip syncing at other notable New Yorkers and people on the street and people from the 
[03:07:00]  news program and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I could see that happening.  Well, let's go to Chris in Toronto.  By the way, a great line came in from, I think it was Dogshit Sniffer.  Wants to know if that lady on Maury is from Flatbush.  Oh, God damn it.  How?  Flatbush.  Oh, my God.  Chris, Toronto.  What's up?  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, I think our favorite band is the Flaming Lips. 
[03:07:30]  That's friction.  Josie and the Pussy Flats.  I'll enjoy that one.  Well, there's the fucking...  There's the song.  Flatbox Fever.  Oh, my God.  Someone's suggesting we do the thing.  It's Tim H. from Columbus, but Anthony wears full Nazi gear.  Oh, how funny is that?  Well, if I could wear a Nazi officer's uniform, I would be happy to. 
[03:08:00]  What if we all did it in blackface?  Steve.  Steve, do you think we'd get away with it if these guys were in blackface and I wore a  Nazi officer uniform?  I absolutely think you would.  Yeah.  And you should do it.  They would let us actually be in the commercial?  I didn't say that.  Oh.  See, I want to be in the commercial.  Oh.  Dressed as a Nazi.  No?  Well, let me ask.  And these guys in blackface. 
[03:08:30]  Oldie time blackface.  Oh, well, that makes a lot of difference.  Not just putting black on your face, like with the outlining of the lips, like the old...  Who used to do that?  Minstrel guys, Al Jolson.  Yeah, Al Jolson was the favorite.  Mammy, mammy, how I love you, how I love you, my dear old mammy.  So if I phrase an email to the executive producer or something like, they love it, the one stipulation  is that they have to be in blackface.  That's right.  Two in blackface.  Two in blackface.  One dressed as a Nazi officer.  One dressed as a Nazi officer.  Ant doesn't want to look stupid.  Right.  I want to actually look like I have some pride. 
[03:09:00]  Can you take that conversation?  And just say, look, the guys want to do it, but they need their own spin.  You understand, because it's a little hokey.  So they need a little edge to this.  They're thinking of doing their part in blackface.  Please tape it.  Yes, tape it.  And then after the fact, go, look, we want to play this on the radio, of course.  It's selling.  And then go, and really sell it.  And go, we got some ideas here.  Anthony wants to wear like a Nazi uniform.  A full Nazi officer's uniform.  Because I enjoy the memorabilia and the era. 
[03:09:30]  I detest what the Nazis have done, of course, through history.  But they were snappy dressers, and I just want to look good.  Okay.  And the other two in Al Jolson era, blackface.  In blackface.  Minstrel.  Why?  Minstrel.  Oh, there it is.  Mommy.  Mommy.  The sunshine's east.  The sunshine's west.  Yeah, the good old days.  I know where.  Let's go down to the speakeasy, boys. 
[03:10:00]  Are you right?  Yeah.  Now, why would you guys want to be in blackface?  I've already explained why I want to be a Nazi.  Yeah.  Maybe something that was more fitting.  How come it wasn't so hard for me?  It's a little abstract, I think.  And make sure you sell it, because Steve's not a good actor.  No.  Steve will call me, but you really don't want them to do it like this, do you?  No.  The guys, they want to play a joke on you right now.  He's the worst.  And have me call and say they want to be Nazis and blackface.  There's Steve doing stand-up.  Because they own it.  That's why the Jews walked into the bar. 
[03:10:30]  Why is no one laughing?  They made the purchase months prior.  Are you insinuating?  The closing took some time, and they got a good price on the bar.  You're insinuating that I'm not very convincing as an actor.  No, you stink.  Hold on.  Look at it.  Nicholson is the Joker.  Oh, that's Joan Rivers.  Oh, wow.  Hello, Mommy.  Congratulations on 10 years.  What the fuck happens with that plastic surgery?  I don't know why she does it.  She's so brilliant and so funny.  A little bit here, a little bit there, and then they go nuts with it. 
[03:11:00]  She doesn't need it.  That's wonderful.  But she addressed it as soon as she came out on stage after she did her AIDS joke and  her brutal 9-11 jokes.  She's like, this face, I paid $100,000 for this face.  She doesn't fuck her out.  Wayne in New York.  Wayne, what's up?  Hey, for that little freak, her favorite song, Flat Bottom Girl.  Fuck it out.  Good job, buddy.  All right, so Steve, you're on that.  Yep.  Homeless man.  Twins invent wedgie-proof underwear.  Or a high school couple uses school laptops. 
[03:11:30]  Stop to make and send.  Hmm.  Oh, I don't know.  I hate the phone sex people.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think?  I'm thinking the phone sex.  Oh, no.  I was hoping they were going to do the homeless story.  Maybe they'll do that one next.  I sure hope so.  Oh, shut up.  I love when they show these people running away from the fucking scary things on Maury.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  We're distracted. 
[03:12:00]  Maury has a great show today.  Way better than this horse shit.  All right, here we go.  Homeless man breaks into church to use phone to call phone sex hotlines.  Guys, let's handle this one with dignity.  A homeless man is accused of dialing up trouble at a Rockland County church.  Police say he broke in at least twice to use a church phone to call a sex hotline.  Tony Aiello has a story.  Elam Alliance Church prides itself as a place that welcomes everyone.  It prides itself.  But James McNair pushed the limits of hospitality and allegedly broke the law in the process. 
[03:12:30]  He broke into a church over in Valley Cottage to use the phone there to call a sex hotline.  Sergeant Bauman says he's never seen anything like it in all his years.  It started on Friday when McNair, a homeless man, allegedly picked the lock and entered the church.  The church treasurer stopped by, found McNair in the office on the phone, and told him to leave.  But she didn't call the cops.  Who gives a crap?  It's amazing.  Homeless guys.  Who cares?  What is this? 
[03:13:00]  What is this about?  Is this the news?  The man made a cummy.  What's wrong with the man making a cummy?  Paddington wants to know.  All right, well.  When the church treasurer stopped by Monday, she found McNair again inside the church building.  This time he was down in the basement in an area used as a children's nursery.  And he was again on the telephone.  This time she alerted the cops, who determined McNair used the phone to call phone sex hotlines, 
[03:13:30]  like the ones that advertise in certain newspapers.  Local residents are shocked and disgusted.  It's sad.  Very sad.  Very sad.  What's sad about it?  You can't say anything you can use on TV.  What can I just book?  Can I say?  What's sad about this?  No one's in the church at the time.  Can we stop talking to local residents?  That's what the news needs to do.  Fuck the residents.  Who gives a fuck what the Jews are upset?  Who cares?  You think that place is a fucking, it's a carnival house anyway. 
[03:14:00]  What do you care?  The fucking Catholic church?  You have more respect when you're on a roller coaster or a fun house.  That's what's disgusting.  The fact they leave him hanging there.  They think he's the son of God.  The man may come.  Good for him.  Good for the man.  They hate local residents.  Local residents.  Why couldn't, why can't I ever be asked?  How do you feel about that?  Well, I think it's great because that guy's big delicious cock wasn't getting enough attention. 
[03:14:30]  His big delicious cock not getting enough attention.  Have you ever lived on the street?  There's not a lot of good pussy to choose from.  Exactly.  What are you supposed to jerk off to?  A fucking, fucking, a Michelob bottle?  Fucking garbage?  A roach on your shoe?  At least he wasn't looking at the Virgin Mary jerking off.  At least he had the decency just to use the phone in the rectory.  Yeah.  The phone has nothing to do with the church.  No.  That man made invention way past the whole Bible thing.  Just a phone.  He was in a priest's office. 
[03:15:00]  You can see the one with the 30,000 highlights magazines stacked up in the corner.  Very sad.  Can't say anything he can use on TV.  What can I, what can I say?  Hold on, let me see.  My understanding is it.  Can't fuck, piss, pussy, shit.  What, sir?  The guy had a complete inability to convey anything without cursing.  What's your, uh, what's your take on that?  Can I say it?  Say anything.  I had fucking cunts.  How could he stroke his cock where fucking Christ is hanging with his dick and balls showing? 
[03:15:30]  Can you use that on TV?  The guy was stroking his cock saying fuck and piss and pussy and eat my asshole.  Can you use this on TV?  What time, what time will this air?  Yeah, what time is this going to be on?  Nothing you could use on TV.  I just want to tell my family.  The cable network, the FCC, things are different for that one.  I want to let my family know.  I want to let my family know.  I'm going to be on the news.  Jesus Christ.  I don't, this is, I just want to finger my own asshole to this story.  Can't use none of this on TV. 
[03:16:00]  Because I'm a, I'm a vampire.  I'm a vampire.  You can't see me in the mirror or on television.  I'm not going to curse, but I'm of the vampire ilk.  Nothing you could say on TV.  Well, let me give it a shot anyway.  Nothing you could use on TV because I won't sign a release.  Because the Jews run the media.  All right, good.  Thank you.  Local residents.  I hate local residents.  They're always disgusted.  How come they're never happy a pedophile moved in? 
[03:16:30]  Thank God, because that guy's a good painter.  I want to see if he'll help with my living room.  Yeah.  I don't have kids.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  I don't care what he does.  Who cares?  At least I know he won't be hitting on my wife.  At least I know my kids will be, hey?  Exactly.  I'll send them over to fucking Uncle Larry's.  They hate the local flavor.  Local residents did exactly what you thought they'd do.  They said they didn't like it, and that's why we videotaped them. 
[03:17:00]  Jesus.  Local residents are cuntbags.  Can't once a local resident be happy.  Thank God someone's jerking off on that phone.  We talked to the man who installed it, and he was disgusted.  Was he?  Was he really?  Was he really?  No, I can't get over it.  And local residents, they've never fucking spoken English before.  Dad, I don't know.  I mean, what are you going to do?  It's just bad.  Bad things to the church phone. 
[03:17:30]  Let's do the local residents.  Oh, I can't wait.  The one is so dismayed, she can hardly get it out.  God love her.  Very sad.  Can't say anything he can use on TV.  What can I say?  Obviously nothing he can use on TV.  My understanding is that he's homeless.  Obviously he doesn't have a phone, so he had to find a phone,  and this was the place that he found a phone.  McNair has a home now.  The guy didn't say phone enough.  The homeless, he didn't have a phone, so where's he going to find a phone?  He had to come here and find a phone.  I mean, I'm not trying to phone in the interview.  I mean, I just don't want to be phony. 
[03:18:00]  I mean, don't play on my phonetics.  I'm not saying it properly.  Oh, right.  We get it.  It's a phone guy.  Enough about the phone!  Enough about the phone!  Right.  He tried to talk into a tin can with a string and jerk off to that.  Oh, sorry, David.  Find the phone.  It was the phone.  Yeah, it was the phone.  We couldn't find the phone.  He had no idea what to do with the phone.  We get it.  Hmm.  I think it's funny.  I can't hear him.  The homeless guy didn't sleep in the church.  He just kicked his feet up on the desk and fucking scrapped a load.  If that doesn't tell you all you need to know about what men are about, he could have 
[03:18:30]  eaten.  He could have stolen jewelry.  He just wanted to scrap a load.  And pesky fucking nun came in.  Well, if that doesn't kill your rod.  That's fucking Alan Aldo with a fucking nun hat on.  Whatever she looked.  Yes, yes.  Stoking your cocky.  Let's hear the guy work, phone into his answer here.  My understanding is that he's homeless.  Obviously, he doesn't have a phone, so he had to find a phone, and this was the place  that he found a phone.  McNair has a home now from Rockland County Jail, where he's held without bail due to prior 
[03:19:00]  felony convictions.  Wow.  The church is now working with Verizon to remove those charges from the phone bill.  That's fucking hilarious.  There you go.  The Catholic Church has a billion, trillion dollars, and they need to have that removed.  I looked at the Verizon guys that have to come in.  I can step on a load over here.  I can step on a load over here. 
[03:19:30]  Can you hear me coming over here?  All right.  It's another load joke.  Good.  It's good.  One trick pony.  Load, load, load.  Switch inflection.  Phone, phone, load.  Phone, load.  Phone, load, load, phone.  Very good.  Thank you, Dan.  It is Master.  It's Povember.  Don't forget that the Master Poe Star Wars video is online for you guys to fuck around  with.  We're trying to turn it into what?  Star Wars kid.  Star Wars Poe.  Star Wars Poe.  Yeah, Star Wars Poe.  Sorry.  Yeah, Star Wars Poe.  Get him wielding a lightsaber. 
[03:20:00]  Put him in a scene.  Whatever.  Star Wars drip.  I love when someone calls someone else a drip or a wet end.  It's a wet end.  Ah, you're all wet.  All right.  High school couple.  It's cleanup day.  Yeah, we're getting rid of some stuff.  Yes, we are.  You know, they say, and this is always good fodder for comedy, scientists reveal that there  might be a cousin solar system.  Oh.  Yep.  That's that.  Very excited.  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  When can we go?  Oh.  Never.  And let's just say it's going to take 41 light years to get there.  Oh, yeah.  41 years at the speed of light.  I don't think we can do it.  I had a funny joke.  Why do we care?  Many years ago, I would do.  Not a funny joke.  Significant.  It was an awful joke.  No, it was an awful joke.  Not a good one.  All right, go ahead.  About space travel.  Yeah.  How the nearest star system to us that could possibly have is Proxima Centauri.  It's either Alpha or Proxima.  I don't remember. 
[03:21:00]  Which was 4.2 light years.  And I said, God Almighty, can you imagine being in the car with someone for that long?  After 300,000 years, I'd run out of things to say.  And what you just gave it, which is the laugh at me.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, it's not that bad.  It's not that bad a joke.  It's just, it's almost like, yes, that's a statement.  Yeah, yeah.  But the humor's lost.  Hey, it's being pointed out.  You did that wonderful phone rant. 
[03:21:30]  But you are guilty of doing the same thing.  Of course I am with Zach.  Zach?  The dress.  Yeah.  Do we have that?  Zach Wild.  Zach the dress?  Yes, I know.  I'm a mumbling idiot.  Do we have that?  Who are we talking to?  Where's Stan?  He's right there.  There's an empty chair where Stan is.  I like it better.  E-Rock, do we have that?  Oh, no.  What?  E-Rock.  Yes.  Do we have that?  I don't know what you were asking for.  Of course you do.  Oh, no.  We were having problems back here. 
[03:22:00]  Don't yell at me.  No, that's not why.  What kind of problems were you having?  You weren't listening.  What kind of, hold on.  Yeah, I wasn't listening because we were having problems back here.  Why don't you just spit on open?  What's the problem?  We were having dilette issues and then we were trying to get line of the day loaded here.  It sounds fine to me.  Eh?  I don't like when he has a legitimate reason.  No, that...  What, Stan?  I will defend Eric as much as it...  Wow.  As much as it hurts you.  And now Eric is mumbling himself.  That motherfucker, I told him.  All right.  Yeah, there was a small window when Eric needs to go over the line of the day with the committee 
[03:22:30]  that picks it and then...  How about the committee fucking shuts up and gets me the audio I've been asking for?  I'll fuck every mouth in this room.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Okay.  So what are we going to do?  We're not doing the dress thing?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I didn't seem to pan out.  No, Eric just refused to do it.  Eric?  Is that line of the day?  I was just watching the waterboarding. 
[03:23:00]  You hear about this waterboarding controversy with the attorney general, I guess?  The new attorney general that has been nominated and they don't want to...  A few Democrats don't want to have him as the attorney general because he will not deny  that waterboarding is a torture.  And I'm thinking, like, water...  All I was thinking was, like, water skiing when I first heard it.  But apparently it's fastening somebody to a board and using water to torture them to 
[03:23:30]  make them talk.  And who cares if it's fucking...  Exactly.  That's my point.  Who gives a flying fuck if it is or not?  The fact these fucking idiots are obsessing over the way we question guys like Khalid Sheikh  Mohammed is fucking repugnant.  God, are we a fucking bunch of dummies as a country?  They were just showing waterboarding those.  And I picture it like you're tied to a board and you get the drip on the head, like the 
[03:24:00]  Chinese water torture, and you're kind of like, uh, it freaks you out.  They just showed what it is.  And they pin the guy down and put a rag, like a washcloth rag, over his mouth and nose  and then take, like, buckets of water and pour it onto his face and intermittently lift  the washcloth up so maybe he can breathe in a little bit and then keep pouring water on  his face.  It was fantastic.  What a great torture. 
[03:24:30]  Now, what we should just do is, uh, either A, let them go, or B, lop their heads off.  Yeah, one or the other.  What do you want?  Yeah, because the guy wouldn't say, yes, it's torture.  It's a, it's an interrogation method.  Yeah.  Any interrogation method can be considered torture to somebody.  Someone will look and say, oh, it's, it, you're trying to coerce somebody into doing  something they don't want to do.  So in order to do that, you can't just give them ice cream.  You know, you're going to have to do something that someone might think is torture.  Whether, how extreme it gets is, I guess, the defining, uh, uh, definition of, uh, torture. 
[03:25:00]  But, uh, I don't think waterboarding is as bad as, put it this way, nothing's as bad  as what the other side has always done to us.  You know, we don't lop heads off and film it.  Yeah.  Jesus fucking Christ.  All right.  E-Rock, we got the dress thing or no?  We're skiing.  Yeah, we're getting it.  By the way, uh, I was, I was, uh, what? 
[03:25:30]  Before, when I did what I did, I was, oh, he's like Fonzie.  He can't say the word wrong.  Oh, thank you for picking up on my Fonzie bit.  That's my new thing.  Yes.  That's my new thing.  I remember that one.  Fonzie couldn't, uh, say it.  I didn't know.  Hey, look, I'm-  You didn't know.  You didn't know, Jimmy.  I'm-  It was-  You couldn't say-  We're sorry.  Correct-a-mundo.  Couldn't say wrong or sorry. 
[03:26:00]  We're sorry?  No.  Like one time he came to me to see his hair.  Yeah.  He was trying to-  He blamed it on Chuck.  That's why he didn't come back.  So you didn't know that I had the DVD box.  Whatever happened to Chuck?  What happened was-  Did they ever give an official answer?  Yes, he was fired because he took a shit in a baggie  and he threw it at Tom Bosley's face in the dressing room.  Hey.  Immediate dismissal.  It was a glad baggie.  It was a protest against those commercials.  And why don't we have any more girls shitting in bags  and throwing them up against windows?  I don't understand why that one never took off.  That's really something that-  Yes. 
[03:26:30]  I don't think, uh, you can do twice.  Why?  I don't know.  To get the right situation,  a woman in a truck with the guy driving.  Yeah.  She needs to take a shit.  They got a plastic bag.  They listen to the show.  Yeah.  They have a phone.  They know the number.  Yeah.  Like, it's a fucking chain of events  like winning the sweepstakes.  Happy Days actually started shit-flinging.  Like, I talked about the Tom Bosley incident  and then Joni picked up on it  and she was famous for it.  Yeah.  But they couldn't get rid of her.  So that's why they called her Shortcake. 
[03:27:00]  because she would never fire a full log.  It would always be a broken wall half-piece.  A little short-  Like, a little short, cakey log  and she would fucking baggie it up,  zip it,  and then, like,  she would lasso throw it.  She would boomerang throw it.  She would go,  wheeze, wheeze, wheeze,  throw!  Wheeze, wheeze, wheeze, throw!  And she would fucking-  She had really-  Apparently a really good aim  was like Davian-  Davian Galagath.  And then when it hit somebody,  it would flatten out  and become a shortcake.  He fucking worked in log. 
[03:27:30]  Galagath.  I did a wordplay joke.  I'm embarrassed I said that.  I thought,  oh, no.  Oh, my God.  He said Galagath.  He's zigging.  Oh, he's on the road course.  I don't-  Oh, no.  My apologies to the listening audience.  Davian Galagath was horrendous.  Turn off all mics.  I have to admit I was wrong.  All right.  Turn them all off.  All of them.  And, um-  All right. 
[03:28:00]  Uh-  What was that?  I'm trying to open  this volatile club soda.  That's the sound  Anthony's pants make  when he's watching  Schindler's List.  Hey, uh,  I don't want to-  I don't want to lose this call.  It's, uh,  Is it Davin or is it David?  And they spelled it wrong there, Davin.  It's probably Pete.  This is Davin.  How you doing?  Davin.  Uh, from Wisconsin, eh?  Uh, originally from Glen Cove, Long Island.  Where's that?  Excuse me?  Where's, uh, where's Glen Cove? 
[03:28:30]  Glen Cove's by Seacliff.  Uh, where's that?  Uh, Roslyn?  Where's that?  Uh, whatever.  It's on Long Island, New York.  Eh, eh.  Where's that?  Meh, meh.  Uh, Davin,  you want to do something  for Wake Up Your Spouse  Wednesday next week?  Next week, I got my roommate,  he's an engineer for the railroad out here,  Canadian National Railroad.  Tired of the train tracks?  Nice.  Yeah, and he got  a actual locomotive horn 
[03:29:00]  off of one of the engines  that they junked,  and I've got it sitting down  in my basement.  I'm gonna hook it up  to a 200 PSI air tank  next Wednesday morning,  and I'm gonna wake him up  with it in his room.  You're gonna blow out his ears.  Quite possibly.  Hmm.  All right.  But I guarantee you guys  it's gonna be one of the best ones.  All right, good.  All right, well,  if you want to do it tomorrow,  we'll make an exception.  All right, well,  I'll try and get it all  set up tonight,  and if I can get it going  for tomorrow morning, 
[03:29:30]  I'll do it tomorrow morning.  All right, Davin,  thank you, sir.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, here's Jimmy  talking about the dress,  the dress, the dress.  Kind of like the phone,  the phone.  Interviewing Zach Wild.  Yes.  You did something in a dress,  I don't, it was fucking,  it was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP  who was in love with you  was telling me  that you did something  in a dress,  and I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage in a dress,  or did you do something  in public with a dress  that was really  completely uncalled for  and hilarious?  I don't know,  but if it was,  I'm sure it was us.  If it was definitely gay,  I'm sure we called it off.  Of course.  You know, when you got guys  that are weighing about  265, 250, 245, 
[03:30:00]  you know, with dresses  that they're bursting out of,  I mean, no,  we gotta make sure  the dresses are for,  like, a 13-year-old  pubescent girl,  you know what I mean?  So it's like,  she hasn't even had puberty yet,  so, you know.  She said you went to a mall.  You were in a mall  or something like that  with a dress,  and you had, like,  your chain wallet.  She said it was, like,  the most ridiculous thing  she'd ever seen.  That's where I was at.  Yeah, I was out in,  I was in Boston  where we were hanging out  in Philly or something like that.  But yeah,  it was definitely beyond gay.  It was a bunch of grown men,  and we made sure,  you know,  we went into, like,  a Victoria's Secret  and just got the most insane. 
[03:30:30]  No, where you're just,  you know,  I can get you  in the smallest stuff  that, like,  a 13-year-old will wear.  Oh, of course.  And you're just bursting  out of these dresses  and everything like that.  You just gave him an idea.  No, I mean...  Dress.  Did you have a dress?  You went with a dress.  There was something  in a mall with a dress.  I'm embarrassed.  Are you?  Colonel Mustard  in the study with a dress.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, what's the matter?  Are you turning away?  I'm not a very good actor. 
[03:31:00]  Oh.  I'm an interviewer.  Jimmy.  Oh, for that.  I'm a comic or person.  I'm just a good Paddington.  Oh, Paddington.  Jimmy.  Swimwalk.  No, I only swimwalk  in celebration  because it just fucking,  you know,  the pounds just peel away.  Hmm.  Swimwalk.  I'll do it later.  You'll feel better.  I know I will.  We all need our...  We all need an end zone dance.  You got the swimwalk.  I know,  but I didn't score there. 
[03:31:30]  You don't do an end zone dance  after you fumble.  I just pulled a Daryl Stingley.  Mine's a big boy brought the big bat.  That's going to be my end zone celebration.  I don't have one.  Do you have one?  When you know you hit it out of the park,  what are you going to do?  I don't know.  How about you just shit your pants?  I might have one.  I could shit myself.  Loudly.  Like, wear rubber underwear  so we can hear it.  Oh, squishy. 
[03:32:00]  Nice, loud, diuretic evacuation.  All right.  I'll just shit myself  when I feel good about a liner.  It's not like a fire hose  bouncing off a rubber wall.  Dude, I had a...  I had a two-footer today.  I want to show everybody.  Nobody wants to see a two-footer.  I mean, I respect that.  Two-footer that wasn't broken.  All right.  Where it, like, was a horseshoe.  Somehow it kept going.  Did you eat a rubber tree plant?  I don't know what happened,  but it was a work of art.  All right, good.  So shit three more like that  so Eric doesn't hurt his feet  when he walks. 
[03:32:30]  I don't know why I said  Eric's not fat like a horse.  I just couldn't think of a person  for a horse.  I used E-Rock.  Yeah.  It's actually not accurate.  He's plump,  but he's not a fucking big horse.  I'm sorry, Eric.  Don't say sorry.  I am sorry.  It was big.  Of course he wasn't.  He's probably playing  fucking Nintendo  or some other game  punks are enjoying.  What, are you playing  in television back there?  The young kids.  E-Rock, what are you doing  back there?  Waiting for you  to do line of the day.  Basically, you say 
[03:33:00]  that he's bored  and it's up to us.  All right.  All right, well.  Waiting.  Well, excuse me.  Don't make us make you  do E-Rock Radio today.  All right.  E-Rock Radio!  Yes.  From 11 and 12 today,  we keep the child alive.  What do you say, E?  Why?  E-Rock Radio?  Playing all the bits  that haven't been played  in a while?  They get to request  like short bits  or what?  Are you in or what? 
[03:33:30]  Do I have to?  Yes.  Yes!  E-Rock Radio starts  at 11 o'clock.  Gentlemen.  You ever take a banana  and scoop it between  your legs and then  touch your asshole  at the one end of it?  Please.  No, I haven't, Jimmy.  What is that?  Danny?  It's gross and it's mine.  Ew, what the fuck  is this website, dude?  Well, it's something  that Dr. Steve  had sent me.  He said he was researching,  doing some research  for his book  and he found this  and it's just...  Jack, is this a whole website 
[03:34:00]  that's called  It's Gross and It's Mine?  What is that?  They're trying to show  some kind of  colon cleansing product  and I guess that the way  that they try to do this  is to have people  send in their  what they call results.  Oh, wow.  And this shit comes out of you?  That's gruesome.  This is more than shit.  Yeah, well, he had explained  it's actually just a big scam  because what you're actually  shitting out  is like the plant byproduct  that you're putting in.  Oh, so it's not even like...  Although some of the results  are quite fascinating.  That is so fucking disgusting.  I love how you got a picture 
[03:34:30]  of the dude that did it.  Oh, God.  Or in this case,  the chick that did it.  Why would you send your face  to the logs next to you?  That looks like eel sushi.  Yeah, look at these  people with a log.  Looks like Tom Cruise.  What are we doing  in our log contest?  Oh, come on.  I love how that one's  in a colander.  It's in a little spaghetti colander.  There's a doily under it.  I ordered that.  Look, I shit this on my armoire.  What is that?  A rubber chicken?  The guy shit out  a rubber chicken.  No, that's...  I ordered that  at the Chinese restaurant.  It's Peking duck. 
[03:35:00]  The guy shit out wind chimes.  All right, where's this website  for the other folks out there?  BlessedHerbs.com.  Oh, shit.  That's a free plug for somebody.  They're good.  That's a fucking old product.  This is like a shish kebab.  It's gross and it's mine.  They just get a guy  with a really big dick  and he fucks everybody up the ass  and they photograph  his cock head with their face.  He got fucking feta cheese on it  and chewing gum.  And a fucking log 
[03:35:30]  like nine inches down.  His fucking pubes have blood in them  and fucking broken skin.  It's gross and it's mine.  And it's someone  with a retarded kiss.  Oh, fuck me.  All right, listen.  Fucking guy.  E-Rock radio at 11.  That means E-Rock  last hour of drive time  for West Coaster.  Oh, God.  It's a big time to be on.  Good time. 
[03:36:00]  Line of the day  is brought to you by  BodogFantasy.net  offering you all  the tools you need  to win this season  in fantasy for tomorrow.  Trash talk with confidence  and take home the glory.  BodogFantasy.net.  Mm-hmm.  Here is a runner-up  line of the day.  Wow, look at how  she flipped herself  right up there.  It looks like she's  poking herself  through a whack-a-mole hole.  There you go, kid.  Right. 
[03:36:30]  Here's another line of the day.  I have to shit myself.  I'm very proud of that line.  Whack-a-mole.  It's my end zone dance.  Okay, there's where it's at.  And there was this blank hill, right?  Mm-hmm.  And there were no...  Oh, see, right there.  He's already learned  his lesson.  He said blank hill.  Ah, see?  Why did he say  blank hill there?  I don't know.  Blank means there's nothing  on it.  Yeah, I know.  Like his head.  Like his head is  fucking empty.  Hey, BodogFantasy.net, 
[03:37:00]  thank you.  Here is your line of the day.  Goodbye.  Here comes  the line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  He's retarded.  He thinks he's  Dog Doolittle,  the white guy  that could talk to black.  Oh, my God.  Dog Doolittle. 
[03:37:30]  That was a great  fucking line.  The line of the day  goes to a listener.  Yeah.  Too bad he did not  hear it  because he can't afford XM.  How do you know  he doesn't have XM?  Huh?  How do you know  he doesn't have XM?  He may be an XM subscriber.  He lives in the wrong town.  Oh, now.  People in the Bronx  like XM.  They enjoy a musical choice.  Yeah.  How'd the merger do?  Did we go through it  or no?  Yeah, the vote was  9-2.  It passed.  I don't think we should  be lying about anything 
[03:38:00]  coming here today.  Do we know yet  or we don't know yet?  We don't know.  Okay.  I hope it does.  I asked you, Rudy.  Does anyone know  we're way out of the loop?  Trust me on that.  Does anyone know  why the XM stock  went up $1.50 yesterday, though?  Yes.  I announced I was not leaving.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Thank you.  That did it.  And people felt  that with Jim Norton on board,  the ship is straight and narrow.  What?  The ship is straight and narrow?  A good straight.  Nobody likes a wide ship  because you get too seasick. 
[03:38:30]  A straight and narrow ship.  No.  Those rock more.  No, they don't.  Not if they're docked.  Did it go back down today?  It's down $0.16, doesn't it?  Yeah, but it was up  like $1.50 yesterday.  People taking a little profit.  That's weird, though, man.  Because Sirius didn't go.  The date players.  Sirius actually went down,  so it doesn't seem to be  attached to the merger.  That's right.  I think they're...  There was...  Yeah, I'm sorry.  It says the FCC action  sparks optimism on XM.  Sirius deal. 
[03:39:00]  It's Forbes.com.  Here's what it is.  People thought I was going to Sirius.  They realized I wasn't.  XM shot through the roof.  Sirius dipped.  Okay.  There you go.  They wanted me to do  my own afternoon drive time show.  Yeah, what was it going to be called?  Huh?  What was the name of the show  going to be called?  Jim's show.  To be determined.  With Jim Norton?  To be determined with Jim Norton.  Myself and a female co-host  discussing issues of the day.  Of the day?  Issues of the day.  Are you going to have  some local residents? 
[03:39:30]  I will be interviewing local residents.  Could we...  Wait a minute.  We can't let this pass.  The local residents rant today  was beyond hilarious.  And I know I say beyond a lot,  but it really was beyond hilarious.  We have to do local residents shit now.  Okay.  We have to go out there  and get local residents opinions  on stuff.  On just bullshit.  On just stupid shit.  Dumb shit.  Who wants to take that bit  and run with it?  I'd rather hear you say beyond  than almost.  When it comes to hilarious,  beyond is good.  Beyond good.  Almost hilarious, not good. 
[03:40:00]  Not as good.  Oh boy.  We have to...  What happened?  I'll put it this way.  Oh no.  Right now, inside my colon,  there's a fucking trap door  and there's a bunch of people  going...  I have to shit  so fucking badly right now.  Picture your attic door.  Picture three elephants  jumping up and down  in your attic,  on your attic door.  And there's a glass coffee table  under the attic door.  How awful this is about to be. 
[03:40:30]  I'm not going to make it home.  I'm going to have to shit.  You're talking about  one of those attic doors  that are in the ceiling.  Yes, yes, yes.  With the pull-down ladder.  Absolutely.  And that thing is ready  to let go.  There's three elephants  and your whole attic  is going to empty out  into your hallway.  Three elephants  and they're all holding weights.  And they all have fat people  on their backs.  Maybe you'll get lucky  and you could fuck  one of their noses.  I would like that.  You know that little grip grab  it does?  Grip grab, grip grab.  Another grip grab.  Yeah, I got a piss too.  Can I say before we go  that I'm doing the Borgata. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Jimmy Plug.  First trip back to the Borgata.  Friday and Saturday,  January 1819.  That's Martin Luther King Day weekend.  Steve, come in here.  The Borgata.com  and tickets go on sale  this Saturday, 10 a.m.  If you want to keep your job,  you have to tickle Jimmy right now.  Right now.  I won't shit.  Right now.  Go ahead.  It won't.  It won't even make me.  Jimmy doesn't get ticklish. 
[03:41:30]  Squeeze his stomach.  I'm a little ticklish.  Squeeze his stomach.  Go ahead.  It won't make me shit.  Yeah, but he's tricking us.  I have all stomach muscles.  If I get you like right there,  lower abdomen.  Oh, wow.  Shake him up and down.  Making me hurt.  Pick him up.  Go ahead.  Don't shake Jimmy.  Please shut up.  Don't shake Jimmy.  It's not working.  No.  You just got a gasser cut on you though.  I'm fine.  No, what you do is  I don't appreciate the  if you want to keep your job.  Shut up.  Just go with the bit.  I'm going with the bit,  but I'm just telling you  I would have done it willingly. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, okay.  See, he's flipped it on you.  Yeah, see?  I did.  I got paid.  Hold on.  Goddamn phone.  It's for you.  Jimmy and I...  Jimmy's holding a banana up  hysterically.  Jimmy and I want to know  what you constantly look at  on your stupid BlackBerry  when you get nervous.  It's not nervous.  The phone was actually ringing.  It's the PR guy.  The PR guy?  That's inappropriate.  Oh, you fuck.  Man, that's...  All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Wait, but Jimmy.  But Jimmy. 
[03:42:30]  Yep.  It's awful.  Jimmy.  I cut a gasser and so did you.  You guys have a conference call.  Shut up.  No conference call for me.  Yeah.  No.  Yes.  No, no, no, no.  It smells like shit in here.  No, no, no.  E-Rock, come on in here.  It's time for E-Rock Radio.  For the next hour,  the channel will be live  until Ron and Fez,  who come on at noon.  E-Rock will be taking your request  for shorter bits  that you haven't heard in a while.  Okay, E-Rock?  Can we take a quick break 
[03:43:00]  and we can gather  some of the requests?  Sure.  And I don't want  Dan and Sam.  I want E-Rock Radio today.  Oh, we don't want that either.  Well, you guys like to do that  every once in a while too,  but it's E-Rock's turn.  Why don't you want to do it, E-Rock?  Because it's always a disaster.  Why is it a disaster?  No one calls.  No one calls, we make it up,  and I just play whatever.  Are you serious?  Oh, there's always requests.  You don't get requests?  Maybe two or three. 
[03:43:30]  The first time we did it,  you got a lot of requests.  I sat here and watched the whole thing.  There was a lot of pre-planning in that.  A lot of instant feedback.  But there's a lot of songs  and things we haven't played in a while  that have fallen by the wayside,  and then people can request that stuff  for the next hour.  Great.  How about we get a...  Look, the phones are ringing already, E-Rock.  I think you're lying.  No, but all right.  E-Rock, you got eight phone calls waiting for you.  After the break, E-Rock Radio, okay?  All right? 
[03:44:00]  Fine.  Can we go to break?  We already did, I thought.  Wow, I really don't have anything  if I don't have these guys in here listening.  Where's the nighttime attitude?  This is how it would be without those two. 
[03:44:30]  Well, they're requesting Jimmy and Dragon Wagon.  That's a good one, E-Rock.  Would you play that one?  Yeah, we haven't done that the last two times.  Um...  How about Yoshi Delivery Guy?  I don't think we're allowed to play that one.  Really?  Yeah.  Um...  How about Silence of the Lambs song with Bill? 
[03:45:00]  That we can do.  With Billy singing?  All right, you'll figure it out, right?  Yeah.  All right, guys, we'll see you tomorrow.  E-Rock Radio next.  Bye-bye.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal. 
[03:45:30]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Hey, what's that? 
[03:46:00]  You've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock. 
[03:46:30]  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can buck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the  centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  It's the fucking rock, you dildo. 
[03:47:00]  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself and he's just ugly and his nose is falling off.  I don't like it.  He's an asshole.  Eric Nagel is this bisexual incompetent radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him and he's not really that smart.  He's here, I can go fuck himself. 
[03:47:30]  Alright, it's E-Rock Radio.  I'm gonna have to do this today.  I have a bad, sore throat.  My glands are swollen.  Sinus infection.  So I'm gonna use Than's mic to talk into for the rest of the E-Rock Radio here.  So no one else gets sick.  I gotta take your requests.  This is our pad stuff.  I don't know.  It has the phone number up there.  No?  So it's 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[03:48:00]  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Fun stuff.  Oh, we got a studio audience.  Thanks, Sam.  Let's go to Steve in California.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, E-Rock.  How you doing, man?  I'm sorry to hear you're sick.  I'd like to hear a little, since Jimmy was on fire today, I'd like to hear a little Jimmy  versus Dragon Wagon.  Now, this is a surprise because this bit is requested every time I do E-Rock Radio. 
[03:48:30]  Are you the same guy that requests this?  No.  No?  Hey, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There we go.  Here's Dragon Wagon.  Yeah.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  That's right.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Wednesday. 
[03:49:00]  Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  This is the trucker, Dragon Wagon.  Oh, my God.  I haven't heard this bit a hundred times yet.  I know.  Jesus, Eric.  It's part of a promo.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Look at Eric.  It gets all mad when we yell at him.  Thank God there's only part one, and it's not like there's two parts of the Dragon Wagon.  Right.  No.  Oh.  No, there are two parts.  Well, this is the one that everybody, even if it's your first week of listening to the 
[03:49:30]  show, you've heard this eight times already.  So why not just plow it right through?  Maybe they want to tape it on their MyFive.  That's right.  My God.  Here's the Dragon Wagon phone call.  It is really, really good.  Yes.  The first X amount of times you hear it, I'm the one who's screaming on it, and I've only  heard it once.  You know, if you've heard this bit more than five times, I want you to email.  All right.  Kill that.  Kill that.  That was not Dragon Wagon. 
[03:50:00]  Butch it.  Did you find it?  Looking.  All right.  That was not the Dragon Wagon.  That was the setup for Dragon Wagon.  So.  Aww.  Yeah.  Let's see what else we got here.  Woo!  Anything.  Do you have anything else we can go to?  What do you have?  Uh, we got Steve bear hunting.  All right.  That's, uh, well, thanks for filling that in, because that goes to line three.  What's up, Mark?  How you doing? 
[03:50:30]  Butch you just told me the bit you want, so we'll play it for you, all right?  There we go.  Hit it.  I want to make sure Steve is safe this, uh, this hunting season.  Oh.  I kind of hoped I could get out of the studio before this segment started.  Has there, uh, well...  Has there been a problem?  Well, they got a bear problem in New Jersey, and Steve happens to live in New Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  I live in Jersey.  That's right.  What's in Jersey?  Every once in a while, uh, they allow the hunters to just start, uh, shooting bears in the fine state of New Jersey.  It doesn't matter where that bear may be. 
[03:51:00]  It could be in your backyard.  They don't give a fuck as long as they thin the herd a little bit.  You're right, Bill.  Well, the bears in Jersey do wander in the backyard.  They do.  When a lot of bears are found in people's pools.  Happening on the Sopranos.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Coming in the backyard and swimming in the pool.  So they want to thin the herd a little bit.  They want to take about 400 bears out, I think.  Something like that.  And the animal rights people come up, and they get all pissed off.  Sure.  They don't want people killing the bears.  Uh, and then the hunters want to hunt bears because it's fun for them.  Right.  And then the people that, uh, live in areas that have bears want them hunted because you 
[03:51:30]  don't want, uh, the, your little puggle to get eaten.  Of course.  At night when you put the little cute guy out back.  It's a boxer.  Well, yeah.  It's, it's one thing.  It's, yeah.  It's one thing to want the actual, you know, to, to, you know, not want to hurt the bears.  But it's another thing when a, you know, 500, 600 pound bear is staring you down in your  backyard because it just happened to wander in there.  Is that going to happen in your neighborhood, though?  No.  It happens in neighborhoods where people want to be in the woods by themselves, and then they're,  then they're annoyed because they're actually living with wildlife.  There's too many people anyway.  Well, it happens in the suburbs in Jersey.  I mean, not necessarily where, where I live because that's pretty close. 
[03:52:00]  It wasn't the suburbs when they started building, my friend.  That's what, that's what.  It was bear territory.  It's called urban sprawl.  It was bear territory.  Urban sprawl.  And I think it's time the bears took their fucking land back.  Right.  Well, apparently that's what they're doing.  Good.  They, they, I like how he says they, Steve.  They're taking all our jobs.  They want to take the grizzly bear off the endangered species list, too.  The grizzly?  The grizzly bear.  That's on there?  Yeah, because in like the Yellowstone National Park area alone, there was like, uh, uh, in 
[03:52:30]  1976, they were down to like 300 bears.  And now it's up to over 600, so they feel like it, they've made a huge comeback and they  don't need to be on the endangered species list.  They've only increased by like.  Something like that.  It was on, uh.  A hundred percent?  It was on Yahoo, if you could find the story there.  And that's enough?  That's enough.  That's enough bears for?  Yeah.  That's enough bears for the one square foot of forest we still have left in this country.  Yeah.  That doesn't seem like enough bears for, for a Yellowstone. 
[03:53:00]  Ramon.  We as humans, we are so pompous.  There's billions of us.  But the grizzly bears in that area, that's up to 600.  Good enough.  Occasionally the animals try to.  We don't need to protect them anymore.  Try to cull our herd.  Yeah.  And it makes entertaining news.  That's hilarious.  If some aliens came down and took over, what herd do you think they'd be thinning first?  Oh, please.  I think it'd be us.  They'd be gone.  At least the Chinese would go first, because there's so many of them that they would, the  aliens would be like.  Yeah, they're like, they're like mosquitoes.  Yeah.  You got it. 
[03:53:30]  Aliens trying to shoo the Chinese away.  They'd be dead, like, really quickly.  They'd just, you know, hunting season open up.  Big mosquito truck.  They just spray that shit out.  We really do need some type of alien invasion to kind of.  Unite us and get rid of some of us all at the same time.  So whoever's left, I like the real strong ones, real good ones, and the ones that'll  be united in fighting the aliens.  Yeah.  The Aryans.  I didn't have the ball to do that.  The perfect race will be left. 
[03:54:00]  We'll have a weaker, weaker.  No, Anthony, you really ought to trim that goatee a little more.  Yeah, no shit.  A mustache part's a little wide.  A little long on the side.  Here's the story.  Once again, New Jersey has declared open season on black bears.  The state has announced its second bear hunt in 35 years.  The six-day hunt in northern New Jersey will begin on December 5th.  It's designed to control the growing bear population.  Opponents of the hunt say there are better ways to control the number of bears without 
[03:54:30]  killing them.  Yes, of course.  That's a fight they have every couple of years in Jersey.  So, yeah.  Do we have audio of the hunters going out and shooting at the bears?  Oh, no, I don't want to hear that.  Someone sent me a video clip.  It might have actually been Buffalo Paul of a bear that got itself up in a tree in  Jersey, and what they did was they put a trampoline underneath the tree that the bear  had crawled up, and then shot it with tranquilizers until the bear fell out of the tree and bounced  off the trampoline.  Oh, see?  They were helping them. 
[03:55:00]  They're trying to be nice.  They're trying to get a little guy relocate them.  This is audio of the bear hunt? 
[03:55:30]  Oh, I think they'll get the guy.  This sounds harrowing.  Must have been very nerve-wracking.  Is this all in fast motion?  You can't take that, Monty.  Oh, foul.  What's Poe doing there? 
[03:56:00]  Oh, and I brought you up.  Wow, the chase was on.  It certainly was.  Glad to see you're okay.  They missed a bulletproof glass on my head.  That's so stupid, but it's funny.  And there you go.  Steve's bare bit in New Jersey.  It's E-Rock Radio. 
[03:56:30]  I'm Eric.  My voice is like total shit right now, but 866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-WOW-1-WOW or instant feedback at opianthony.com if you want to hear something.  Craig in Mississippi, what's up?  Craig.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, E-Rock?  Okay.  I was calling to hear the Drill Diva bit.  Okay.  Jim Norton bit.  Good one.  We can do that.  Here it is.  Sorry for all the background noise. 
[03:57:00]  I just was opening a box.  I got another gift.  Another gift.  I'll show you with the box.  What was in the box?  What is in the box?  Oh, what's in the box?  It's really a cool gift.  Thanks, Andy, from Seattle.  He sent me a used drill because I'd gotten the drill bits a while ago.  We're really starting to get some strange, strange gifts from our man.  That is a skill drill.  This would be great to use in my apartment, though, right?  That is fine, but for your needs, though, I couldn't see you needing anything better than a cordless, though. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, this is kind of a fucking...  Yeah, now you need a cord...  You should have a cordless drill in your house.  Now, is this good for putting things on the wall?  A cordless is even better.  Yeah, you could scare a hooker with that.  That's a little bulky, a little heavy.  A little heavy.  You need an extension cord, which...  You want the prongs?  Yeah, no, no. 
[03:58:00]  Let me see the prongs.  This is absolutely a two-pronger.  Oh, it's a two-pronger.  Of course.  Okay.  Of course.  This is nice.  Thanks for the 35-pound drill.  That is a heavy drill.  I can use to fucking hang my celebrity photos.  This is good for...  I'm going to build a deck in my apartment building, you shithead.  Anybody have anything lighter?  Like, maybe a fucking bowling ball with two ledge shoes?  You're a creep, Andy.  It's a little strange, to say the least.  Fucking weird gifts I get.  How about just some pictures of vaginas and some pornography? 
[03:58:30]  Right.  Let's say hi to Reg on Long Island.  Reg?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  Go ahead, Reg.  Listen, man.  You know, I love the show and everything.  I've been listening forever.  Thank you, sir.  I hope he was on The Nighttime Attitude, but fucking Norton is totally pissing me off.  Why, sir?  What, sir?  I'm a dick bag.  Why?  Dude, you don't appreciate shit.  That's true.  I had to send you a fucking drill?  Oh, it's...  Hey, wait.  You sent him the drill? 
[03:59:00]  No.  No, no, no.  Oh.  I'm saying, whoever this guy was, it wasn't me.  I wouldn't fucking send him shit.  You don't understand something.  Dude, here's what you don't get.  You do get really strange gifts, though, Reg.  Yo.  I'll tell you what you...  Dude, I'll tell you.  There would be nothing without the show.  Dude, I'll tell you...  I'll tell you what you don't get.  I want a new drill.  Do you understand?  I'm an entertainer.  And if a common person wants to send me a gift to pay homage, that is acceptable. 
[03:59:30]  You want to jerk me off with your common person bullshit.  But it will be a new fancy drill for a man of my caliber.  You want me, me, plugging a cord in like you have to?  Yo, calm down.  I want a cordless fancy drill, boy.  And think about how that guy feels.  He taped it a postage, shoved it in a box, sent it to you, hey.  Did he really?  Well, think about how I feel.  Hoping I have a new cordless gift and seeing that cumbersome cord. 
[04:00:00]  Think about how a man in my position feels.  You don't deserve to sit there.  I wish Bill Burr would kick you right in the fucking teeth right now.  Bill Burr wouldn't dare.  Bill Burr knows a fancy person when he's sitting next to one.  Stop trying to divide and conquer.  That's right, sir.  You're not smart enough to hurt my feelings.  You're with your toes with the cords on them.  I'm not there, so I can't kick him in the mouth.  Nah, you wouldn't kick me in the mouth.  I'd kick you right in the mouth.  Nah, you wouldn't.  Fuck you and fuck your mother.  What do you think of them apples?  Oh, shit. 
[04:00:30]  Fuck you.  What do you think?  That shit gets to me?  No.  I'm just saying it to you.  Well, Bill Burr kicking me in the teeth gets to me,  so I'm saying fuck you.  How much was the postage on this?  Why don't you go hang yourself with the cord on your drill?  Hold on.  Wait, I want to know how much the postage was on this.  Hold on, union guy.  I want to know how much postage was on this.  I don't know, but whoever this is,  it was shit and it should have been first class overnight postage.  Don't ever send me.  Shut your fucking mouth.  You don't deserve it.  Shut your dumb Italian mouth.  I'm talking, boy.  Shut up, common person.  There's a fancy entertainer talking. 
[04:01:00]  I don't know.  Where do little people put prices?  I don't even know.  I don't look at prices.  I just say, ship, and they pick it up.  All right, Reg.  Jimmy, you're a cock.  All right.  Good one, Reg.  There you go.  What, you're a fucking Italian with a black man's name.  Take care, Rufus.  Let's say hi to Paul Anka.  Paul?  Besides, it's my birthday, and people want to send me gifts.  The rules.  What?  The hosts get tools.  Drill retails for $29. 
[04:01:30]  Does it really?  $29 of that hard-earned cash.  All right, here's a new rule on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Yes?  You're permitted to send me gifts, but they are not to be under $50.  $50.  Do you hear that?  Look, do you understand how valuable my time is?  If I'm going to open a gift, A, it will be new, B, it will be first-class postage, and  C, it will be over $50 with a receipt in case I don't like it and want to bring it back 
[04:02:00]  or actually have one of the interns bring it back for me and make an exchange.  I'm wearing a nice gift from one of the listeners.  Of course you are.  I don't wear gifts from the listeners.  I appreciate the gifts.  But Eric tapped me during that and had plugged in the drill.  So, oh, there we are.  Riveting.  Unplug that hunk of shit and take it out of the studio or I'm going to fucking drill a 
[04:02:30]  hole through your face.  It still has sawdust on it.  Yeah.  Did you see the cloud come out of it when he, uh, hold on.  He tapped me during that bit, so let's do it twice.  Pull over.  This is going to be a big laugh getter.  There we are.  Remove it.  Good one.  Stupid Reggie with his toolbox.  Hey, you know, the guy sends you a gift.  Shut up.  Jim Norton's drill bit for you on E-Rock Radio. 
[04:03:00]  I am E-Rock.  866-WOW1-WOW.  A reminder for this Saturday Night Virus, 9 o'clock.  It's the Sam and Than Show.  You can find them at thanandsam.com.  Catch it!  Get all their, uh, their archives, podcasts, all that stuff.  And is that Halloween photo of me still up on your site?  Yes.  All right.  And, uh, I guess a crayon drawing of me too.  Yes.  That's all up there.  Thanandsam.com.  This Saturday night for the Saturday Night Virus, 9 o'clock, and then High Society at midnight. 
[04:03:30]  Woo!  Another request coming in, uh, this is actually from Sam, from the Than and Sam show.  It's one of his favorite bits.  Uh, let's hit it.  It has to be addressed.  What, what?  I don't want to.  Believe me.  It's painful for me to have to address this.  But it's gotta be addressed.  It does.  Because, you know, it, it happens too often.  Yeah.  And it's, it's, it's just, it's one of those things that has to be addressed.  What happened?  What?  Look. 
[04:04:00]  We all like Big Kev.  Right?  We all like Big Kev.  You're going there?  I have to.  Holy shit.  Dude.  Dude.  I have to.  You're blowing up his spot?  It's not a spot to blow up.  Holy shit.  Everyone is freaking out.  Everyone's freaking out.  Holy crap.  Everyone.  It's not a secret.  Except to him.  This is going to solve a problem.  I'll be honest.  I'm relieved.  Because when you say we have to address something, I'm sitting there like big saucer eyes like,  uh oh.  Yeah.  He's going to call me out on something. 
[04:04:30]  I thought I was getting booted.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm like.  No, no, no.  We're, we're, we're, yeah.  Jimmy and I are looking around, you know, we're feeling kind of confident, but not really.  And then, all right, get ahead.  It's because it's all whispering and everything's going around and stuff like that.  And it's just got to be brought out.  All right.  Kev has no sense of smell.  None.  That's what it is.  He does it.  It's a medical thing.  He's talked about it on the air a few times.  Which means he has no sense of taste, by the way.  Which means how do you eat so many cupcakes when you can't taste them? 
[04:05:00]  Well.  Oh, I thought.  Why not just mash up carrots and eat them?  I thought that explained what he wears every day.  He had the, he had the, the surgery and he has lost a lot of weight.  Yes, he has.  Over the course of the year.  For the new listeners, you got to explain that.  I was talking to Kev before the show today.  He was close to 600 pounds when we first met him.  Yep.  He's now down to 320.  Giant.  I believe.  Giant.  And he's getting two operations to get the excess skin removed, which I think is part of what  you're going to bring up.  Maybe part of an issue that's going on.  So, since he has no sense of smell, he's not able to really get a sense of what he is emitting 
[04:05:30]  at certain times.  And there are certain days he comes in here, today being one of them, that it's not that  pleasurable to be in his company as far as my sense of smell goes. 
[04:06:00]  Yes, cranky ass.  Your olfactory senses.  My olfactory.  And mine.  Yes.  It is what is called cranky ass sometimes.  You just get a little sweaty.  You get a little thing.  Hey, we've all had our times.  I know sometimes I sit in here and I'm sweating and I know perhaps I should maybe, you know,  psss, psss, psss.  A little B.O.  A little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  You're like getting hot.  Sometimes it's 110 degrees in this fucking studio.  A little B.O.  never hurt anyone.  And I'll plaster my arms down, run for my coat and get the fuck out of here as quickly 
[04:06:30]  as possible.  Why would you care?  If I had, believe me, if my pits stink, I'm fucking raising my arms and walking by every  one of you creeps.  Who cares?  Not only raising your arms, you would get the fan out.  Yeah, I would just fucking flop a little like I was doing the bird.  With that.  And with all due respect and with all due friendship.  And I'm so uncomfortable with it that that's the reason.  If anyone ever asks, well, why don't you just say it off the air or something?  Because I'm too uncomfortable to face somebody and say it off the air.  I'm a big pussy. 
[04:07:00]  Now he's hearing this during the replay.  It'll get back to him.  He's going to hear this during the replay.  It'll get back to him.  Just say what you got to say.  You don't want to say it privately.  I think I did.  You're always better off doing it in front of the entire country.  I think I just did.  That's a hell of a friend, I got to tell you.  I think I just did.  I just, I just, you know, that was it.  And when you look in the fucking monkey cage over there that our producers and various  staff are in, the second I even mentioned it, their heads were bobbing up and down.  The fucking bobblehead dolls in there. 
[04:07:30]  Mentioned what?  Uh, Kev?  Yes?  Hi, Kev.  Hi.  Hi.  Is there a problem?  There was an issue two times ago when you came in.  And then this time today, there is sort of a, um, no, I know you have no sense of smell,  right?  That's true.  That's why you're on the bus today.  Uh-huh.  Because you're one of those that doesn't have to really deal with the homeless people.  Sitting next to Tom eating egg salad.  It doesn't matter to him. 
[04:08:00]  Right.  It doesn't matter to him.  But, um, there's been, there's been, uh, there's been talk around the studio.  Okay.  And, and we just want to bring it to your attention so that the problem can be solved  and everything.  Mind you, this was...  All due friendship, all due respect.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Mind you, it wasn't talk amongst all of us.  It was one person talking.  No, it wasn't.  There has been...  So, basically, Anthony said what?  Anthony, Anthony, for once, brought this to everyone's attention. 
[04:08:30]  I pretty much stayed out of it.  Okay.  Look, you stayed out of it, but it's, there's just...  Oh, my God.  Why?  That's all it's going to do.  It's fine.  Now, look, um...  Yes, Anthony.  I, I, I...  You know, you know, you're my friend, Cap.  Oh, okay.  And, uh, normally, I guess this would be a face-to-face thing, but I am really too much  of a pussy to actually, uh, come out and face-to-face, uh, say something. 
[04:09:00]  Okay.  But there, there is kind of a, a fragrance, I guess, that was coming off of you that was  a little...  Well, Jimmy, uh, help me out here.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  No, that isn't true.  That isn't true.  Okay.  Yeah, I, I just wanted you to know.  Um, there, there, if, if that's true, I apologize.  Smells like, smells like, I love to smell like, come in the morning. 
[04:09:30]  Yes?  I assure you, there's a, uh, there's an explanation.  Oh, okay.  Well, uh, that doesn't have to be something public.  No.  All right.  Okay, okay.  All right.  So, I, I apologize.  Are you sure?  It was, uh, it was me and not anyone else.  See, see, look at these motherfuckers over there, nodding their heads.  Uh, there's, there's five people nodding their heads in the other room.  And Bill is throwing his shoulders up like he didn't know. 
[04:10:00]  It was a little rough to narrow it down with a lot of the homeless in here today.  Okay.  But, um, but, uh.  Well, thank you for bringing it to my attention.  I would, and like I said, if I wasn't such a pussy, I, I would have, uh, said something  in, in private.  But it's not like these little co-conspirators that are sitting there fucking saying shit.  Well, it's really easy for everybody else just to kind of sit back and not say anything  while letting you do the heavy lifting.  Jimmy.  You're next.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, I, I assure you there's a, there's an explanation. 
[04:10:30]  Well, we had speculated.  Low water pressure.  And, uh.  And it has to do with an upcoming surgery.  Yes, it does.  Yeah, okay.  There's some, there's some preparations that are happening and, uh.  Yeah.  That, that may be involved.  That's what was speculating.  Although I can't, I can't identify it exactly because I, like you said, I, I have no way  of telling myself.  That's a tough fucking nut.  No sense of smell.  Yes.  Eh, it's rough.  All right, there it is.  There it is.  Well.  Problem solved, people. 
[04:11:00]  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Um, I, I apologize.  All right.  No need.  All right, big cat.  Okay.  Take care.  Bye.  Oh, Jesus, Anthony.  Well, I, you know, I needed to clear the air.  I just wish I had, wish I had more balls instead of just sitting here nodding quietly.  Now, let me also bring up the fact that is why Jimmy was fucking miserable when he walked  in.  Oh, really?  Did you see Jimmy's face when he walked in?  Yeah.  He was fucking miserable.

I'd also like to hear Anthony doing Al Sharpton too. 
[04:17:00]  That's one of my favorite bits.  Okay.  We don't have that ready.  I was told it's E-Rock Radio.  And you have everything at your disposal.  I was told Al Sharpton with Anthony Cumia was going to be available.  I wasn't told that.  Okay.  Well noon to three baby.  I'm looking.  All right.  Let's just go to what Jeff from Staten Island requested.  This is All the Way May on E-Rock Radio.  Dead Monkey Hummer knows more about my family than I do.  He's from Staten Island.  Opie's great aunt was All the Way May. 
[04:17:30]  All the Way May.  That might have been her baseball nickname.  But yeah.  Her first name was May.  He knows more than I do.  Wow.  Maybe it was?  Yeah.  My grandma's sister.  Yes.  May.  The All the Way May.  Jesus.  And she was the inspiration for leading her own.  All the Way May?  Hey man.  It was like the 20s or whatever it was.  It was 30s.  Your grandmother's sister was known for getting deep dicked in the back of a fucking etsel.  She's a nun!  Now she is.  She's been a nun for like 80 years. 
[04:18:00]  But she was getting her fucking wound busted in 1920.  I don't know her.  Never met her.  I'll bet you that she's a nun now.  Only because some fucking, some strapping black buck gave her a fucking womb busting.  Are you trying to say my great aunt was a size queen?  I bet you she was.  I bet you he sweated and he had overalls.  And he undid his overalls and knelt and gave her the deep dicking of her fucking privileged life.  That's my great aunt.  He gave her a good kidney pushing. 
[04:18:30]  Been a nun for her whole life, Jimmy.  Well, she played a little baseball apparently.  God's work.  She certainly is.  She didn't call the police when he winked at her.  All right, all right.  She waved him into an alley and took that fucking buck and got that big Jim Brown cock smashed into her fucking privileged white body.  She moaned.  She moaned with a weird satisfaction.  It was like, like it was the moan of one who is finally being filled properly.  Now she's a fucking nun.  She was all the way May back then. 
[04:19:00]  He named her that.  I can't believe I got it all the way May.  She said, I've never taken a dick this deep in my privileged white life.  Deep dick me, you.  And you know what she said?  Whoa, this is so comfortable.  Deep dick me.  He fucking was kneeling between her legs in an alley.  And I bet you he had her fucking knees pressed up by her ears like her ass was in gravel.  Fucking with that fucko's black buck thighs straddling her. 
[04:19:30]  Giving her a fucking good stiff deep fuck.  Madonna played my great aunt in the movie?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that would have been if that was all the way May here.  What was the character in the movie?  All the way Meg?  A.K.A. the stripper turned softball player that Madonna played?  I was just thinking about your aunt getting deep.  You are.  Ah, Jimmy's filling up.  Thinking about your great aunt. 
[04:20:00]  Getting a good fucking racial line crossing fucking lesson.  A racial line crossing.  He was striking a blow for fucking 200 years of naughty behavior all the way May.  In the 40s when it was naughty.  I bet he fucking splooged in her too.  He didn't give a fuck.  All right, all right.  He knew he was on a fucking, he was on a fucking apple truck going back to work somewhere.  Apple truck.  Whatever.  He was an apple truck worker.  He would lift and put the bushels back on.  And he saw that fucking white man's pride and her blonde hair and her fucking, her long 
[04:20:30]  nun clothes.  And he fucking gave her a womb full of fucking taboo seed.  He filled her womb with taboo seed.  The seed you could only dream of at night as your inept white husband tried to deep dick  you but couldn't.  That's my great aunt, man.  No disrespect.  No disrespect.  None taken.  She sure she became a nun.  She got a lot done in her life.  And he then, that was the only only nun because the police officer saw that and realized that 
[04:21:00]  she was yelling, ooh, and not rape.  So he shot the black buck and she had to yell rape and become a nun.  That's what happened.  That boy never got back on that apple truck and went back to work.  They had to pay off the Dickens family.  I know Madonna played her as a whore but I don't, you know, I don't think it was that  accurate, Jimmy.  Up and all the way, man, he took a couple fingers in the shitter while she was being deep  fixed.  She was a nun her whole life.  I bet he reached under and he was keeping her ass off the gravel and while he was holding 
[04:21:30]  her ass and deep dicking her, he had two fucking worker's fingers crammed into that  fucking innocent white tuchus.  With those big fingernails.  Hey, hey, don't jump on, Anthony.  When he was fingering her because he had such long fingers like the guy from the Green Mile  and she would have had to explain to her boyfriend why she had fucking field dirt in her  fucking crammed seven inches up her keister.  Hey!  All that...  Get her keister out of this. 
[04:22:00]  All that bushel lifting.  He got fucking field dirt under his long fingernails.  Sweaty man with a fucking straw hat and a pair of overalls with no underpants.  That fucking delicious black prize bobbling around.  Stop grabbing your junk!  You're talking about my great aunt!  You want to get all worked up?  And there's all the way, May, on E-Rock Radio.  A message to Chad from Jersey.  Hey.  That being said, this Saturday, 8 o'clock, Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier host Smodcast, 
[04:22:30]  brought to you by QuickStopEntertainment.com.  8 p.m. Saturdays, right before the Saturday Night Virus.  And let's go to the phones here.  We've got Jeff in Utah.  Jeff, how you doing?
