<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, jumping between personal anecdotes, current events, listener calls, and celebrity guests.  The show began with Opie recounting a miserable weekend of illness for himself, his wife, and child, culminating in the discovery of a missing third of a tooth thanks to hummus.  This segued into a discussion of a drone incident near JFK airport, with Anthony vehemently denying any involvement despite receiving a phone call he initially mistook for the FBI.  The hosts speculated about impending drone regulations.  They then spent considerable time mocking a poorly photoshopped publicity photo from their early Sirius XM days, playing a clip from a Fox News segment that used the photo, further highlighting its infamy.

The show continued with a diverse mix of subjects:  a listener's story about their niece's apparent communication with a deceased relative; the Florida sinkhole that swallowed a man, along with a CNN reporter’s exploration of a legendary Florida sinkhole;  rumors of Howard Stern's television appearances and his impressive PR; Mitt Romney's post-election reflections; the rewatchability of *Sixth Sense* (deemed lacking); the merits of *Poltergeist 3* (also deemed lacking);  and listener calls detailing paranormal experiences.  A Michigan listener recommended visiting Devil's Den, a Florida sinkhole accessible to divers.

The next segment shifted gears to the hosts’ interactions with the cast of *Wicked Tuna*, including online disputes and offers to go tuna fishing.  This led to a discussion of a direct message received from Miss Teen USA Delaware, who’d been involved in a sex tape scandal, after listeners attempted to get her attention via negative tweets.  Seasickness became a topic, prompted by the tuna fishing discussion, with hosts sharing anecdotes, including one host vomiting underwater.  The death of Paul Bearer, a professional wrestling manager, followed, including a pre-recorded interview clip with Sam Roberts. The hosts then compared the current state of professional wrestling to its past, discussing specific wrestlers and storylines.

A significant portion focused on a 911 call about a nursing home employee's refusal to perform CPR on a dying woman.  The hosts and callers expressed outrage at the nurse, using highly offensive language ("hateable woman," "cunt," "pig"), debating the legal and ethical implications, good Samaritan laws, and the fear of lawsuits in healthcare.  A nursing home statement claiming the employee misinterpreted policy was later reported.  The conversation then veered to Valerie Harper's brain cancer diagnosis (from People Magazine), personal childhood shoplifting stories with detailed descriptions, and a visual examination of old Pia Zadora photos from *Wee* magazine, with graphic commentary on her body and body hair.  The Miz was briefly mentioned as an upcoming guest.

A segment focused on the hosts' and a caller's memories of vintage Playboy and Penthouse magazines, involving graphic descriptions of models like Barbie Benton and sexually explicit commentary.  This transitioned to a discussion of sports bloopers, focusing on video clips of announcers making mistakes.

The Miz, a WWE wrestler and actor, then appeared in studio.  The conversation covered his career, his fiancée, international travel for WWE, *The Marine 3: Homefront*, his time on *The Real World* (including a story about his mother’s reaction), and a brief call from a former *Real World* cast member.  The conversation included a discussion of *The Real World*'s evolution.

The show further explored the changing landscape of television, contrasting older unscripted shows like *The Real World* with modern reality TV, followed by a discussion of WrestleMania 29 with The Miz, who also mentioned fondness for the "Sex for Sam" bit.  After The Miz left, Jim Norton's segment began, focusing on his career anxieties, selling out shows, and listener calls.  A black caller expressed discomfort with past racial discussions, particularly Anthony Cumia's comments on eugenics, prompting Norton to acknowledge the concerns and suggest the need for more balanced perspectives. Other callers discussed relationship issues: a man whose wife was jealous of his threesomes, another man's obsession with escorts, and a listener struggling with post-divorce dating.

A caller, "Jimmy," detailed a situation with a stripper who snorted Xanax, sparking a discussion about the pitfalls of such relationships, sexual habits, and open communication with partners.  This was followed by a commercial break for "Masked Sexual Flavors," gel strips designed to mask the taste of semen during oral sex, with crude and sexually explicit language used to describe the product and related jokes. The show concluded with promotions for the Jim Norton Show and the next program.

Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit. 
[00:00:30]  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  We're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  The I Want Dick Crisis.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton. 
[00:01:00]  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Clean it hard.  Clean it hard.  Clean it hard.  Clean it hard.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Put enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning, everyone.  There we go.  Oh, boy.  Was there some fiddling done?  Why?  I don't know.  The mic sounds a little different.  Your mic?  Yeah, a little bit.  Like my headphones.  But yeah, it's more...  Was there fiddling done?  No fiddling.  No fiddling about.  All right.  Fiddle about.  It's just my ears.  It's okay.  It's a little bassier.  You can count on that.  I don't know how you guys notice this stuff. 
[00:02:00]  I never noticed.  Oh, God.  The first bomb of the day.  I never noticed when the mics are not lit.  Because we have very sensitive ears.  Oh, yeah.  And very sensitive rears.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa, hey.  Hey, now.  Hey, now.  Whoa, hey.  The Oaster has come back.  Upper respiratory infection.  What?  Congested.  Damn. 
[00:02:30]  Damn, yo.  But feeling better.  Enough to come in here, yeah.  Because I go crazy staying in my house.  I go absolutely nuts.  I need to be out and about.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Were you totally sequestered?  That's a big word right now to use.  Was I sequestered?  Very popular word, sequestered.  Were you sequestered in your app?  Well, it all started Friday when I did the fake cough and said,  I'm starting to feel sick because I was trying to get out of our meeting Monday.  Oh, right.  But the reason I did that was because I really was starting to feel sick.  Whoops. 
[00:03:00]  Then I had a hell of a weekend.  And the problem is that the whole family went down.  The first time the whole family went down.  Usually, you know, someone gets sick in the family.  You know, there's usually someone around to kind of take care of everybody.  Lost the whole platoon.  We lost everybody.  Everyone was down and out.  Me, my wife, the little one.  Oh, man.  Had some horrendous wet cough.  And then my son had a double ear infection.  So I was telling you before the show, just imagine your worst hangover. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, boy.  Where you just want to sleep.  And you haven't slept in a while.  And then fucking 15 minutes ago, Kenny comes and gets me?  What?  No.  Just imagine your worst hangover.  Yeah.  But you can't take care of yourself.  You need sleep desperately.  You feel like shit.  But you can't because you've got a little one in the house you've got to take care of.  Couldn't even imagine that.  No.  It's like hell on earth.  Yeah.  No.  No.  I read people's tweets.  Could you imagine that?  Or their Facebook when they're like, oh, you know, I was so tired and I wanted to sleep. 
[00:04:00]  But, you know, little and then some kid named.  Was, wasn't asleep yet, so I had to stay up.  My kid would be, if I had a kid, it would be dead.  Because I would just fall asleep and let it just run around sticking things in light sockets.  I can't, I can't base my sleep and lifestyle on some kid.  Yeah.  We all get to the point, you know, you're sick and you go back to just being a child where  all you want to do is roll up into a ball, have mommy make you some soup or something. 
[00:04:30]  Ooh, soupy.  But you can't do that because you've got a little one that's sick.  And obviously, you know, that takes priority over your own rest and health.  Yeah.  It's brutal.  My kid was up all night while I was sick and my wife was sick because of the ear infection.  Ear infection.  Wow.  I couldn't do it.  You didn't do it, right?  If you're a parent, you have to do it.  But you have to, it's not even a question.  Yeah.  You wish there was someone you could call. 
[00:05:00]  Crazy.  And just say, please take care of my kid because I need to just fucking sleep for the next 16  hours.  I'm going to wake up and everyone's okay.  Exactly.  If I can leave me alone.  But that was the first time that happened.  We were all sick, just wandering around the house, like begging each other to, you know,  help.  Yeah.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Help me.  And then insult to injury.  I didn't tell you this part.  So then I haven't slept for a day, a day and a half. 
[00:05:30]  I'm fucking sweating.  I'm sneezing.  I'm coughing.  And I decided I wanted just hummus.  You know when you get an urge for weird shit when you're sick?  You had a little craving for some hummus?  Stupid hummus, right?  And I toasted up the pita bread and I'm just like eating hummus.  Like just having a moment to myself, right?  Next thing you know, I go, why is there a pit in my hummus?  Why is it crunchy?  What?  I'm like, what the hell's going on? 
[00:06:00]  Turns out that half my tooth fell out.  Holy shit.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  Whoa.  It wasn't a pit.  One of my teeth in the back on the left side.  Just cracked or the...  I guess.  It's like half gone.  Oh, man.  I'm like, so now I'm like, now that fucking hurts because I couldn't get an appointment  until tomorrow.  What a disaster.  Well, it was my hummus. 
[00:06:30]  I'm like, what is crunchy?  And I look at this thing.  Oh, man.  I shouldn't say half, but probably about, I don't know, probably like a third of the  tooth.  Enough where you felt it.  Oh, I could, if I touch it, it's like hitting a fucking nerve.  Are you kidding me?  I lose a third of my tooth as well on top of everything else that's going on?  Eating hummus?  Jesus.  What the fuck?  That's pretty bad.  Shipping your tooth on hummus.  How fucked up is my tooth is right.  Yeah, hummus took it out. 
[00:07:00]  I think it was the crunchy pita bread that I toasted up.  The old pita bread.  Or this tooth was just waiting to go.  So when's the dentist appointment?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Yeah, I'm scheduled for a cleaning and then they're going to have to fucking do something.  Probably going to have to throw a cap on that thing, huh?  I don't know if it's going to be a cap or a crown or maybe just, sometimes they just  mold some shit or, you know, take care of it.  Yeah, drill it out or something.  Was it your whole tooth or was it like a cap?  No, it's about a third, but it goes all the way down to the gum. 
[00:07:30]  It's like, it's kind of like a sinkhole, to be honest with you, on the side of the  tooth.  Fuck.  That's fucked up.  And now I've been like playing with it with my tongue, so my tongue's all caught up.  Because it's a ragged, sharp edge.  It hasn't, I don't make me laugh.  It hasn't had anything to wear, erode the rock away.  So it's all, it's all sharp and you fuck your tongue up.  I remember that.  Yeah.  I had a couple of those over my, uh, my chest history.  My chest is, it's fucking raw.  You sound a little bit raspy.  Uh, it's been a few, it's been a wonderful couple of days, but, uh, Brenda Beccaro voice. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  But everyone, everyone is, uh, moving forward and getting better by the day.  So my kid's sleeping because the doctor gave him Benadryl, uh, penicillin and I don't  know, some fucking aspirin shit, but that Benadryl is scary, but, but you know what?  Just knocks them out.  I can see where, I can see where parents might sneak a little Benadryl every once in a while.  They drug their children like on airplanes.  I've seen, uh, parents say that.  Yeah.  I mean, cause, uh, you know, they want them on the Benadryl for a while.  I mean, one more day.  That is it.  It's, it's evil. 
[00:08:30]  It's evil to a almost three year old.  Does it just knock them out?  In a half hour.  Then he doesn't, he doesn't move.  Doesn't move for like 12 hours.  Well, there's a solution around the house.  Just passed out.  Yeah.  That Benadryl is fucking wow.  And it's children's Benadryl too.  So, you know, it's weaker.  Damn.  How do you get a double ear infection?  I don't know.  I, I, over the weekend I did take him out to get like a vegetable juice at our joint.  And, uh, it was really windy and cold. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, that howling wind that goes in your ear.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is all the shit you forget about until you have a kid and you relive that.  Remember being a kid and getting the wind in your ear?  You'd get back in the house and be like, ow!  And that would turn into an ear infection a lot of times?  Why?  Maybe a doctor could explain.  I guess it's because it inflames the inside of your ears.  Yeah.  It fucking gets all red and swollen, I bet.  That's the only thing I could think of.  Oh, that used to hurt like a fuck.  That was, that was day, what day are we up to?  Is it what, Wednesday, I think?  It was Wednesday.  Yeah.  Man, when you're sick, you lose track. 
[00:09:30]  To me, I think it's Sunday or Monday.  Yeah, what is it?  Why are we working on a weekend?  Monday was doctor day where we all had to go in.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because I had to get both kids checked out, and then I'm begging the pediatrician to listen  to my lungs, and, but then I went to another joint to get the antibiotics for the upper  respiratory.  Upper respiratory?  Just looking at the snow here.  More snow?  Like five to eight or something.  Yeah, yeah.  That's going to fuck up the parade in Huntington this weekend. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, that's this weekend, huh?  I'm going FH Riley Sunday for the parade.  I don't think I have any plans.  Huh?  What parade?  St. Paddy's Day parade.  It's a big deal in Huntington every year.  I don't think I've got plans.  I think I'll head out to fucking Huntington.  You should.  FH Riley is right on the parade route.  You hang out.  You grab a beer.  Have some beers.  Trust me.  We don't need the business.  I mean, it's mobbed every fucking St. Paddy's Day just because we're on the parade route.  Might be cool to get a drone-eye view of the crowd.  Is that your drone?  Everyone wants to know. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, boy.  Did you guys talk about this?  No, no.  Not a word.  Does anybody think it's mine?  I've gotten, I swear, three minutes.  I woke up and I checked my mail and Twitter and everything like that.  It was like three minutes ago.  And it was like, dude, is this you?  And a link to the story.  I talked about it on the show twice yesterday.  Right.  I talked about it on Fox News yesterday.  I think we got the clip.  They played the video.  They played the video.  They did.  And it's like, and somebody still is just like, hey, dude, is this you? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  No.  First of all, it wasn't me.  I'll be honest.  I was Google mapping.  Yeah.  I'm like, all right.  I know where you live.  I know where JFK is.  I'm like, all right.  This is possible.  It is feasible.  This is feasibly slightly north of where the planes come in.  I was at the movies yesterday and my phone rings and I didn't want to take the, I saw  a movie called Stoker, which is a kind of an indie thing.  Nicole Kidman's in it, but it's not, it's kind of a, yeah. 
[00:11:30]  And it's kind of weird.  It's got a lot of little twisty turnies in it, but it's, yeah.  Why did you go see that?  Do you know anybody?  Yeah.  I just went, I went out and it was suggested to me.  So, yeah, we went out.  Nice.  We saw a movie.  Yeah.  So my phone rang and, and in my contacts, I have people listed in certain ways and I 
[00:12:00]  have certain friends that work for certain agencies.  And one of the numbers, just what came up was just FBI.  And I wasn't sure if that was what came up because whoever called me was from the  agency, like that, I don't know the person or if it was in my contacts that way.  Cause I don't remember it being in my contacts that way.  So I just peeked and I'm like, fuck, I got a whoosh, like an adrenaline rush.  Why?  You thought it might be a female body inspector. 
[00:12:30]  Didn't you use the wrong voice for that, Jimmy?  A female body inspector.  And by the way, remember the people that wore those shirts and thought they were so cool.  By the way, for the people that didn't see that because Jimmy's on the radio, he actually  like pushed his elbow toward me when he said a female body inspector.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I was like, oh my God.  And then I, I realized maybe that's the way it was in my contacts, um, which it was, but  I still don't know why they were calling me.  That's, uh, I now have an FBI friend too. 
[00:13:00]  Perhaps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those guys are good to know.  I was, uh, I was a little like taken aback because I fully, I fully expect to get a phone  call at least or a visit just from, you know, do you know these, do you know anyone in the  area that has one also?  Do you go to a place, the, the, the, um, the field that, that they fly at close to Kennedy?  Do you, you know, how bummed are you that it wasn't your drone? 
[00:13:30]  I'm so happy.  It wasn't.  Holy shit.  That person is in huge trouble.  Oh, really?  The FBI is asking for the public's assistance to find the person, the, uh, joint terrorist  task force and Homeland security and the FAA in the FBI.  I know.  Was chasing, uh, trying to find him.  I know who it is.  Who?  I can't say.  Oh, I don't want to say it this morning.  You're not ratting?  No, I'm no rat.  Fuck that shit.  Fucking rat.  Um, yeah.  So that was, if you twist my arm, I might have to tell you. 
[00:14:00]  Who is it?  I don't know.  What else has a drone?  Who has it?  Who has it?  Um, are they in trouble?  They just want to talk to him.  They're probably going to find out it's just some dumbbell who has had no ill intent.  Well, they could still be in trouble for, uh, you know.  Problem is, they are going to ground all these fucking things.  You know, it's just a matter of time.  Enjoy your little hobby.  Exactly.  I'm not even, I'm not even at a point where I'm like, you know, I'm going to fight for  this, like with the Second Amendment.  I don't have a leg to stand on.  We were talking about it yesterday.  My whole argument is, it's fun! 
[00:14:30]  It's so obvious they're going to drown.  It's fun!  They're going to ground all of them.  Yeah.  Well, you're a photographer, it's different.  Well, in my case, photography is why I use it.  Although your videos are very beautiful.  Oh, they're stunning?  And you use inspiring music, so.  Stunning!  I only use music that, uh, what you don't get.  Duran Duran?  No, I got to use music that isn't taken down by YouTube.  And isn't available, because they always send you that thing, oh, you're copyright infringement.  You're allowed to?  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Because I use, like, music from the loops that, uh, that, uh, are in some of the Apple 
[00:15:00]  programs.  No, you're allowed to use, uh.  GarageBand, things like that.  You're allowed to use, uh, other people's music.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You just can't claim it as yours.  Well, I would never do that.  Right.  GarageBrand?  They took that on your videos?  No, but they said, like, a certain people can't hear it, and, like, Canada says, I can't  forget it.  Oh, yeah.  Your videos stop because of the music.  Yeah, they do block it.  Yeah.  Iraq comment.  Certain music labels don't allow it at all, like EMI.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anything with theirs, it's automatically deleted.  How do they do that?  How do they know? 
[00:15:30]  Is it, like, is it like...  Digital.  They have a digital print of the songs.  What's the program where you can hear it?  Shazam.  Shazam.  Is it something like that?  I, I don't know, but they just...  Oh, Warner Music Group is another one, too.  Yeah.  If you put anything that's in their catalog, it automatically knows it's from that label,  and it sends you a warning and takes it down.  Yeah.  Oh, so they do take down videos.  Yeah, yeah.  Only certain, uh, music labels.  Oh, those are fucking assholes.  I know.  Because a lot of them will allow it, you just can't claim, uh, that it's yours.  You see what Shazam's doing these days with commercials, too?  Commercial will be playing and have the Shazam logo, and apparently you, you know, you do 
[00:16:00]  what you do when you're trying to figure out what song you're listening to, but they listen  to the commercial, and it gives you additional information on the product or whatever it  is.  Pretty, pretty smart.  It is.  Who wants more commercial?  Yeah.  This commercial's too short for Christ's sake.  Well, if you're interested in said product, you might want more information, but I just  think it's cool how they're kind of integrating that shit into, um, into, like, practical  use.  That's the photo they used on Fox, huh?  Oh, God.  That stupid fucking photo haunts us to this day. 
[00:16:30]  That piece of shit from XM back in the day.  Well, uh, here's what happened yesterday.  I, uh, I was, of course, being accused that it was my drone all day.  Right.  So, um, I was talking about that on Twitter, and, uh, Rick Leventhal, who's over at Fox  News, um, who, uh, his, his girlfriend's so fucking hot.  Really?  Yes.  She, she, I did, uh, I did red-eye with her a few times.  I'll show you.  I don't, I don't want to, yeah, yeah, yeah, blonde.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's, she's really, and she's hilarious and cool. 
[00:17:00]  She's great.  She knows Colin, too, which is really weird.  But, um, yeah, he is, so he was on Twitter.  And he was, uh, he was talking about the drones and stuff like that.  So I sent him a video and, uh, told him about some things.  And he was like, oh, could we use it on, uh, Shepard Smith's show?  I was like, sure.  So he called me up, and we talked for a little while, and I gave him some information about  it.  So he went on Shepard's show and kind of conveyed what I had told him.  Uh, but they put a picture of me up.  And in the old days, this used to bother, it used to bother everybody really bad. 
[00:17:30]  It's like, oh, you used such a shitty picture and stuff.  Now it's just, I started laughing.  When it came on, I was just like, ha ha!  They used that publicity shot of us from XM.  That is the worst shots of us ever.  I think that's why...  Shut it, Jimmy.  I think that's why we don't take PR shots anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the one where my eyebrows are...  When we, uh, first got back to radio, uh, XM, exclusively, uh, eight years ago, went 
[00:18:00]  down to Washington.  They wanted to do this big, huge thing, and a photo shoot, and...  Worst photographer ever.  Well, it started with the makeup lady.  Yeah.  You didn't know what the fuck she was doing.  She gave me Ronald Reagan makeup.  Yes.  We just assumed that, uh, they knew what they were doing.  I look at your neck.  I don't even look real.  What is that?  Your chin is gone on your neck.  I don't even look real.  That's a terrible photo shoot.  It's so fake.  That doesn't look like you.  At all at this point, right?  No.  No.  That's the famous picture where, uh, people...  God, that isn't you.  I have two Adam's apples, because he fucking... 
[00:18:30]  He took my...  Have we talked about this picture in a while, Iraq?  No, it's been years.  This drives me fucking nuts.  It's so bad.  It's a collector's item.  It is a collector's item.  What happened was...  Oh, God.  Is my hair even that color?  Dude, he did double...  You have two neck...  I got two Adam's apples, because what happened was he loved...  What it comes down to is he loved Anthony's eyebrow.  We're both in the shot.  So he decided, all right, I like Anthony's eyebrow, but I don't like what Ope was doing 
[00:19:00]  in that picture.  I forgot what I was doing.  So he took my face and my head from another shot that he liked and put it on my body in  that shot, but he didn't fucking match it up, so I got a giraffe neck.  You have an extra inch and a half or two inches of neck that makes your neck...  You look like E.T.  You could see where the double Adam's apple is.  Opey has frightened E.T. neck.  Right.  And then... 
[00:19:30]  It's terrible.  And then, because I smile like most people, and you kind of close your eyes a little bit  when you smile, not close.  Yeah, you squint when you're smiling.  He didn't like that.  So then he took my eyes and he opened them up as I'm smiling.  Yeah.  And then I'm telling you, he did something when you were in picture, too, because...  Yes.  He couldn't leave everything alone.  He added a splash of douche to your eyebrows.  My eyebrow is up so high in that one picture.  Right.  I think he used, like, my eye from one picture and the other eye from another.  Send me that picture so I can tweet it. 
[00:20:00]  And the color correction's all wrong.  It's one of the worst pictures we've ever taken.  Well, the guy's on a laptop, and he shows me what he wants to do.  He goes, look, I got this cool new Photoshop program, whatever.  It's eight years ago.  Yeah.  He goes, look what I could do.  And he showed me how he's going to take my head off this one shot and put it on this shot.  And you want to.  And I went, do not do that.  Find a picture where we both looked okay and use that one. 
[00:20:30]  He goes, no, don't worry, man, don't worry.  I go, please don't do that.  Turns out he didn't listen to me, and he fucking did it anyway.  And that's why I don't like the guy to this day.  He fucked us.  Doing the people's eye route.  Yeah.  He looks CGI.  Yeah.  It looks fake.  It's the weirdest thing.  Unbelievable.  When that popped on Fox News yesterday.  Oh, Sam Murray sent it to me?  I just did.  I'm going to tweet this picture.  You got to.  So you guys could all laugh your balls off.  When that picture popped on Fox News yesterday. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  I started fracking off.  I'm like, oh, no, not that one.  That picture has been haunting us for eight years.  Oh, it won't go away.  We have better photos on the Facebook.  They could have just went there and taken it out.  Facebook.  When these news agencies are like, do you have a picture?  Can we request a picture?  Right.  It's like, no, just fucking find one.  Just find a picture somewhere.  They're all, there's thousands of them out there.  All right, I got it.  I'll tweet it a little bit.  It is funny to see now.  But you don't look anything like you. 
[00:21:30]  No.  And I look CGI.  Yeah.  Well, the makeup, the makeup to begin with.  Yeah, yeah.  That old picture is fine.  It's like, you know.  Oh, yeah.  It would have been just as easy.  Just as easy.  And more.  And you could just cut you out.  You look like a normal person.  And more updated, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This one.  That one's all right.  Any other one's all right.  Any of those.  Except the one.  I don't even really care.  Except for that one.  Because I know that he photoshopped us.  And the makeup was like, you got like rosy cheeks. 
[00:22:00]  I remember looking in the mirror at the makeup after the photo shoot.  Like, oh, no.  Really?  I was like, oh, no, they didn't.  No.  I just assumed she knew what she was doing.  I'm like, okay, it looks a little weirder than the fucking mirror.  But I guess a little photo.  Look at those two.  Young, full of piss and vinegar kids right there.  Look at that fresh-faced Opie.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Look at me.  I'm laughing my ass off all the way to the bank.  They use that picture a lot, too.  That's not a bad shot, though. 
[00:22:30]  That's from N.E.W.  That shot's 36 years old.  Oh, I'm thinking that's XM.  Okay, that is N.E.W.  That's N.E.W.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's like 12 years ago.  Oh, my God.  They'll use that picture.  Yeah.  And that's the problem.  When people see us out and about, they're like, oh, man.  What happened?  You look like shit.  No, it's 12 years later, you idiot.  But, yes, we do look like shit.  But that was true.  Fair enough.  Oh, Jesus.  Fair enough.  You're right.  So, yeah.  Fox News used that.  And it was just, I was laughing.  But, yeah, Rick Leventhal got on there and was talking about drones. 
[00:23:00]  He asked me all kinds of stuff about the capabilities and whatnot.  This is how it sounds.  Well, you know, Shep, if you have money, you, too, can be a drone pilot.  The devices range from a few hundred bucks to about ten grand or more fully equipped.  And one famous owner I spoke with today is radio's Anthony Cumia from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Now, he's posted videos online of his DJI S-800.  That's it there.  A six-rotor craft the size of the one described by the Alitalia pilot. 
[00:23:30]  It's a stunning piece of technology.  You look at the video it's shooting there.  It could be equipped with GPS, autopilot, radio transmitters, cameras with stabilizers.  It can fly up to a mile high and it can be remotely programmed to a specific waypoint at a specific speed where it can hover for a set time and return as commanded.  It's illegal to own and operate, but there are FAA restrictions, but they're written in 1981.  Those rules will almost definitely have to be rewritten because technology moving so fast.  And Shep Anthony Cumia says he was not piloting the drone that caused the trouble over JFK. 
[00:24:00]  Well, I never would have dreamed that he was.  I wonder how long it is before a seventh grader can fly his drone into the parents' house and kill them all.  Jesus.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, probably for a second.  What the fuck is Shep?  Maybe four years are older than that now.  What Shep are you talking about?  I don't know.  Flight into a house.  They're going to ban all these things.  It's going to be.  They have to.  Like he said, the rules were pretty much written in 81 when you really needed a visual reference to the model.  You couldn't just, like, look. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  You couldn't send it away.  You had a wide look at it the whole time.  Now you can just send the fucking thing wherever, you know, you want it to go.  So, yeah, they'll regulate.  Oh, my God.  What picture is that?  We've been next to each other for way too long.  Oh, my God.  Sam is just finding every publicity shot ever taken of us.  Look how old that equipment looks.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Look at that.  The old phones.  The old big monitor with the vents on the back.  Holy fuck.  Man.  That's 12 years ago easily as well.  Scotso's studio behind us. 
[00:25:00]  It's got muni.  Yeah, remember that?  That studio used to smell like smoke.  Oh, yeah.  That's the Scotso studio and the Jay Moore is going to get some oral studio.  Eh, it was before he was married.  I don't know what happened in there.  It didn't look pretty, but I officially don't know what happened in that studio.  Crazy fucking crazy things going on in that fucking studio.  I have no idea.  Holy moly.  Wow.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:25:30]  Jeez Louise.  What's up, Jimmy?  I'm just amazed.  Oh.  He's got a good PR guy.  That fucking...  Howard Stern is not taking over for Jimmy Fallon.  That's in the paper today.  It's a massive story in the paper today.  He absolutely is not going to take over for Jimmy Fallon when Jimmy Fallon moves and does Leno.  But he has someone that is really good at pushing out stories.  Yeah.  He gets himself...  Him and Trump have two of the best public relations machines behind him. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  How do you get yourself into every conversation about TV?  It's fucking amazing.  Remember he was going to take over for Larry King?  Right, right.  That story was being floated.  Yeah.  And that was never a possibility.  No.  No.  It wasn't even considered.  American Idol.  American Idol.  American Idol.  But then once...  But then America's got talent he's got.  So it's like now that any other time it's mentioned, they're going to...  Right.  They're going to be like, oh well.  It came true.  It's like one out of 20 things that were talked about.  Man, good for him.  He's got a full page in the paper today.  Yeah.  But that is not happening.  But that...  I'm just in awe of the PR machine that they got that out. 
[00:26:30]  They're like, fuck it.  Yeah.  That is very smart, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How the fuck do you do that?  I don't know.  Will he run?  Like, no one should ever say that about Donald Trump.  Yeah.  But they do.  It's like this guy fucking knows how to get himself out there.  The fucking presidential candidates we're talking about.  Romney, Obama, and who will Trump?  Give the fuck.  I don't know.  But he's in there.  He's in that discussion.  Romney finally talked, huh? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He got on Fox News and talked about the campaign and how it was like.  Weren't you hoping to see him with really long hair and a beard?  Would you like to?  Yeah, yeah.  How he really is?  Right.  Fuck it.  He probably shaved just before that appearance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He actually expected to be elected president.  Yeah, he did.  He really thought, you know, they must pump you up like crazy.  All your yes men around you.  Well, it comes from that world where, you know, he's entitled. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I can't lose.  What mistakes did he admit to?  Because they said he admitted to some mistakes.  Did he admit?  I think when that tape came out.  And that was Jimmy Carter's grandson?  Really?  Yeah, you saw that story, right?  He was the one that pushed that fucking tape forward.  Oh, I didn't know it was.  Oh, you didn't know that?  No, no.  The 47%?  That famous tape?  Maybe because he wants...  That was Jimmy Carter's grandson.  He wanted someone in office that could take the heat off his grandfather for being a horrible  president?  Is that what happened? 
[00:28:00]  Well, Jimmy Carter was pretty proud of his grandson.  Did Romney admit that he should have went on...  It sounds stupid, but those other shows he wouldn't go on, it made him look weak and distant,  like he's not going on these shows and just talking.  He could have went on all of these shows.  It was a bunch of things.  What a douchebag not going on...  I mean, Letterman is not the guy, but he's still, he's got a couple of million people  you could go on.  What are you doing?  You know what, though?  Do you honestly think he'd get a fair shake on The View?  If he sat down with The View girls, those fucking vapid liberal cunts... 
[00:28:30]  Yes, he would.  ...just chewing him apart about everything...  Here's why he would.  Because guys who are that good at being politicians are pretty charismatic in a room, and very few  people come at them as hard as they should anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think they would have attacked him.  They would have absolutely...  Those bitches would have attacked him on the whole 47% of the people are fucking freeloader  shit, and it's like...  And you know what?  Romney, although a lifetime politician, isn't all that good at fucking communicating his point. 
[00:29:00]  That's another problem he had with getting elected.  He didn't have that charisma.  And I think him and his people knew he'd have been fucking dog meat in front of the liberal  media and those liberal talk shows.  But wouldn't you love, like, if he said something stupid like that 47% thing, to be able to  sit down and be able to explain it to a lot of the audience who's pissed at you.  Like, he wasn't going to places where people who were hating him for it would hear him. 
[00:29:30]  And what he could have done is, if he had a real, a smart explanation...  He's a bright dude, he could have gone around and just fucking explain it.  Sometimes if you give a real explanation, it takes every bit of firepower from somebody.  It's so hard to transcend the bias that goes on with shows like that.  I think it was a few things.  And then the fucking final nail in the coffin was the fact that Hurricane Sandy wheels in,  takes the news completely off of him, puts it on Obama and Christie, and it was right 
[00:30:00]  up to the election.  He was out of the news.  He wasn't even able...  No one cared what he...  Where he was, who he was talking to, what he was talking about.  And that was like the death knell right there.  Not that I think he had a chance even before that, but if he even did in some of those swing  stays, it was gone by that point.  Just all the momentum of him doing a good job on the debates and everything.  You know, now it's just arguing and fucking doesn't matter.  But yeah, he talked about it, though. 
[00:30:30]  It was a rollercoaster ride.  I don't think he enjoyed his time campaigning as much as Obama does, because he's apparently  still doing it.  Well, I mean, it's fucking...  You've got to be ready for everything to come out, man.  There's nothing you're going to be able to hide in a campaign.  They get everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  True.  Your fucking past friends.  Can you imagine running for office and having audio of this show played?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You wouldn't get out of the gate.  No.  You really do give up a career in politics when you do this program. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Dude, after my first appearance on this show, my career in politics was ruined.  Gone.  On the phone, I talked about golden showers.  Yes.  You sure did, Jimmy.  Got our attention.  It was a terrible phone call, but still ruined my political career.  Loved it.  It was definitely a good phone call.  You guys talked about the sinkhole, right?  Oh, poor sinkhole guy.  You see the pictures coming out today?  Because now it's just the foundation with the sinkhole.  With the hole in it, yeah.  The sinkhole was just in his fucking bedroom. 
[00:31:30]  Just under his bed.  The rest of the house was fine.  Under his bed.  The rest of the house was fine.  Earth ate him up.  And did you guys talk about, I don't understand why they can't fucking get the body.  Come on.  How can you not find this guy?  What, they just don't want to fucking deal with that?  Maybe they're afraid to risk rescue workers.  Or, I don't know what, does a sinkhole collapse in on itself?  Yeah, it's very dangerous in there.  Sinkholes are a motherfucker, but it doesn't seem like they gave it the old college try.  Doesn't it seem like... 
[00:32:00]  It seemed like they only gave him a couple hours.  Yeah.  If that was like JFK Jr. or something, they'd be still digging.  I guess the guy, his life wasn't really that important to anyone except his family.  That is such a small fucking sinkhole.  Right, look, that's the whole foundation of the house.  He was in the wrong fucking place.  And he happened to be on the bed when it happened.  Yeah, yeah.  Man, God must have just hated this guy.  Yeah, fuck.  That is fucked up.  Did you see the story on the news of, I think it was a CNN reporter went down into another 
[00:32:30]  sinkhole that's been there forever?  Really?  No.  Pretty fucking cool.  Scary?  Yeah, he went diving and everything, because there's water and there's all sorts of other  fucking underwater caverns and stuff.  Fuck, man.  I guess it's a legendary sinkhole down in Florida that you could actually visit.  It's been there forever.  But they went down in this thing to show you, you know, what these things are all about.  Damn, yo.  Imagine if our fucking apartment buildings were on sinkholes because they're on that. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We have trains that run right under our buildings.  You know that, right?  I didn't know that.  Oh, yeah.  There's pretty much right under.  Oh, wow.  I don't even know how our buildings are anchored.  They really take it down to, like, the fucking bedrock in Manhattan.  Manhattan's just a big rock covered with dirt.  And, yeah, that's why on each side of Manhattan, the north and the south parts of Manhattan,  they got the big buildings because they were able to hit bedrock in there. 
[00:33:30]  And the middle is...  Not because it's just, you know, fucking dirt.  They don't have as much bedrock in the middle to anchor the building.  So, that's why there's no big buildings in the middle of Manhattan.  Yeah, that's...  Lower and up.  They're not even allowed to, really.  No.  So, that's why Midtown, you can get big ones, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Midtown.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All the way up to...  Yeah, this is it.  This is it.  It's on CNN.  Maybe we can put this up on our Facebook page.  Open it up today.  Wow.  A massive sinkhole carved out of solid limestone by drops of water.  So, this is what a sinkhole looks like from the inside. 
[00:34:00]  From the inside.  I would love to go around there.  Before you fill it up with sand and dirt.  I've seen some stinkholes.  And if someone were living right on top of this, they'd be at risk.  Of course.  I was obligated to split that.  It says Sunshine State homeowners might be surprised to find out just how common these are.  What are the chances of someone having a house in central Florida and living...  263-1.  ...like this?  Very good.  Not as probably as close to the surface as this, but you definitely have cavities of this size all over the state of Florida. 
[00:34:30]  The fossils found in this sinkhole show it's been around since the ice age.  But no different, Black says, in the sinkholes we see opening up today.  These are just a few of his pictures.  The one thing they all have in common is water.  He loves sinkholes.  Rainwater is going to turn into rainwater and that's what's naturally acidic.  That's the device that dissolves the limestone and will help create these cavities.  What is unusual about this sinkhole...  Yeah.  It must take a week or two to build up that kind of water. 
[00:35:00]  ...called the Devil's Den.  It's open to tourists for viewing and diving.  Dive and structure, Prince John's, takes me under for a look.  I find that this seemingly relaxing pool of water.  It's too visual, I guess.  That's pretty cool.  That water is clear as fuck, man.  Yeah, and then they go diving and there's all sorts of little passageways and stuff underwater.  Man, that's got to be so dangerous.  You get lost in there and stuck in one of those caverns up with...  Oh, man, that would be terrible, right? 
[00:35:30]  Imagine going through one of those things and you just...  I would go.  The rock closes it behind you.  Oh, man.  And you're just like, all right, let me just look at my air here until it runs out.  I'd be pretty scared, but I would go on a dive with someone that knew what they were  doing in that place.  Claustrophobic, man.  It'd be creepy, yeah.  Holy shit.  When you're in the ocean, it's too big.  And when you're in those things, it's too small.  Too tiny.  That's why diving is best left to pools.  Eee, that's creepy.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  That sinkhole, though.  I don't understand why...  Why wouldn't they try to get the guy?  Yeah, you'd think there's something...  Or at least tell everyone why you can't get him.  Like, everyone's just there going, why can't you get this guy?  They didn't want to bother.  They didn't even want to...  Yeah.  You get a couple...  You just fucking start digging until you find the guy.  Well, you said it.  He's not JFK Jr.  That's it.  I mean, literally, they went to the bottom of the ocean to find JFK Jr.  Some poor bastard in Florida.  Just some poor...  And then, of course, just to throw him back afterwards, that old joke.  Oh, yeah.  But that's really what they did. 
[00:36:30]  They did.  A catch and release with him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Crazy.  What's the official explanation?  I don't know.  I haven't heard anything as to why they haven't gone to get him.  I guess it's dangerous.  They're saying it goes down 50 feet.  Yeah.  But we have equipment that could handle that.  Yeah, send like a guy on a cave.  Or a cadaver dog.  And what else are they going to do with that area?  Yeah.  They're not going to build a house anytime soon there, so fucking get the guy.  No.  You get Poltergeist House because it's now a fucking grave. 
[00:37:00]  It's a grave.  Poltergeist House.  It's a grave.  With old man in the screen door.  Oh, man.  You don't want that guy popping up.  Oh, that guy.  Mr. Sinkle.  God is in his holy temple.  Oh, that guy was creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think kids see ghosts?  The stupid kid freaked me out the other day.  Really?  Yeah.  All of a sudden he goes, Daddy, I'm scared.  I'm like, what?  What are you scared of?  The two ghosts over there.  Oh, fuck.  Shut up.  Don't say, wow, that's fucking scary. 
[00:37:30]  Of course it is.  The two ghosts over there.  Holy shit.  The fuck?  No, that's fucking creepy.  But in his mind, it was a dumb shadow or something he saw.  But now I'm like, fuck.  Because I'm the one that gets up in the middle of the night when the whole house is dark.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When you don't have all your faculties.  Your faculties.  Everything is just starting to fucking fire up for the day. 
[00:38:00]  Holy shit.  That's fucking creepy.  Fuck.  Sixth Sense really was a fucking brilliant movie.  Sixth Sense was really good.  Yeah.  To pull that fucking off is crazy.  That fucking, one of the best twists ever.  Yeah, but you can't watch it again.  That's the problem with that movie.  No, it's not.  Rewatchability, zero.  Completely zero.  Because it is so obvious that he is dead the whole movie.  Oh, great.  Poltergeist.  Spoiler.  Is that Poltergeist music, by the way?  Yes.  Oh, it is? 
[00:38:30]  You know what was a fucking good movie in that series?  Huh?  Surprisingly enough, Poltergeist 3 was a good one.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, Poltergeist 3.  What made 3 good?  Hulk Hogan.  2 was a bust, right?  No, 2 wasn't that good, but...  Get some fucking 3.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There it is.  3 had the old man on the screen?  No.  That was 2.  No, okay.  Yeah.  3 was good.  Why is that coming up on...  Why is that coming up?  Well, because Tom Skerritt was in 3. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Was it good?  No.  But Tom Skerritt was in it.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Look at that.  Right there.  He has luck.  Oh, he tricked us.  Tom Skerritt.  You tricked us.  He looked very young in that.  He sure did.  He looked white stuff.  How old is he now?  It was like, out of nowhere, he started looking older, but a lot older.  That's what I said!  Oh, you did?  Of course.  What's his name?  Tom Skerritt.  Yeah, Poltergeist 3. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, all right.  We got to take this call from Boston.  Oh, no.  Eric, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Your comment kind of freaked me out.  It reminded me.  My niece was in the corner of our living room just talking, and we went over and we asked  her, who are you talking to?  And she said, Grandma Helen.  And that was my mother, who died two years before she was born.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm telling you, man.  They might have special powers.  Oh, man.  You don't want special powers in kids when talking to ghosts.  I think kids might have some weird special powers. 
[00:40:00]  I hated that.  The fucking girl.  All onto the bed.  Sixth Sense.  She's like, bleh.  Making this shitty puppet show.  She deserves what she got.  Fucking terrible puppet making.  Horrid puppet show.  Who is that?  What girl is that?  It's Mila Kunis, right?  Oh, that was her, huh?  Yeah.  No kidding.  She went on to what?  Oh, I don't know.  A couple.  Oh, the OC.  Who cares?  The OC.  I'm going to ask this guy.  So how do you know that your niece was talking to the grandma? 
[00:40:30]  Did she get any info where you go, holy fuck, that's shit from my grandma?  No, we didn't test her because we probably didn't want to know.  Right.  Oh, that's creepy.  We just don't know how she could even come up with the concept of it.  I also have, I forgot to tell you this one.  I got a Valentine's Day balloon.  It's huge.  I got it for my wife from the kids.  It's like a hollow red heart balloon.  The gold-covered rose wasn't enough? 
[00:41:00]  Jeez.  Anyway, that thing floats around my house.  It scared the fucking shit out of me the other day.  Because the helium is like, surprisingly, the helium was, you know, staying strong in that thing.  But now it kind of floats at eye level.  Oh, man.  And all of a sudden, you come around the corner and this thing is just fucking floating in the air.  Fuck that.  Holy shit.  I get frightened very easily by things like that around the house. 
[00:41:30]  I'm frightened.  My grandson sees people at my house and at his house.  All right.  Here you go.  Mark in Iowa.  Mark in Iowa.  Go ahead, Mark.  Yeah.  Hey, my four-year-old grandson will stand in our back corridor by our, like, going to our back door in the house and says he talks to people.  We've never seen him do it.  We've seen him there, but never, you know, caught him talking.  And he was just a couple weeks ago down at his home in Kansas City, and he came screaming out of his room and told his dad about the man that was in his bed. 
[00:42:00]  And he didn't know what to do.  But we've always thought something was kind of goofy with our house.  Yeah, you raised a little tattletale.  Of course.  I mean, we've got, you know, lights will go on and off in our house.  But I just chalk it up to, you know, the house is 48 years old.  And we've got, like, a door going into our living room, and it'll shut.  I mean, we've got some really goofy shit.  I don't follow on to it, but my wife and my daughter are really squirreled by it.  You know what was the scariest movie was Insidious, which Dom DeRosa recommended? 
[00:42:30]  It fell apart towards the end.  There was some really dumb shit that happened that annoyed me.  But there were parts of that movie that were fucking horrifying.  Yeah.  That was a scary movie, man.  No one saw it?  No.  Insidious?  No, no.  I recommend that, even though at one point you're like, oh, right.  Joe DeRosa's taste of music and movies stink.  Yeah.  But he called it, though.  He said that it gets shitty towards the end of the day.  Yeah.  I was talking about the movie I saw last night, Stoker.  All right.  And it was weird, man. 
[00:43:00]  And fucking, like, strange.  This relationship thing between this girl and her uncle.  And fucking, like, boo.  Really creepy.  And devious.  Yeah.  Very, very.  It's good.  It's good.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good.  I liked it.  Is it a horror film?  No, it's kind of a thriller coming of ages.  No, it's not one of those.  Peace.  This chick is fucking nuts in it.  Just fucking.  But everyone is.  The uncle, the fucking mother. 
[00:43:30]  It's pretty cool, though.  I liked it.  Some Korean director did it.  And it was good.  It looked great, too.  Really.  It's amazing how different directors from different places have a kind of weird,  because it almost had, like, you could tell it was an Asian director based on some of  the shots looking like those, like, The Ring and Grudge and things like that.  I mean, Grudge, excuse me.  Just kind of strange.  I thought it was pretty cool, though. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Independent stuff can look really cheesy, too.  Like, it's on home video.  Uh-huh.  I don't know what makes something look right.  Like, is it the way, like, is it what the cameras are using?  The lighting.  It's all about lighting.  I was talking to Kenny yesterday.  We were leaving here.  I was going to my apartment, and we were walking down the street right here, and they  just had banks of lights set up.  They were filming some TV show, and obviously a big fucking TV show, because the equipment  that was there on the street. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  And I said to Kenny, I'm like, why is all this always necessary for these shoots?  It takes hours and hours to set it up.  And Kenny just goes, why don't they just use natural lighting?  You ever see when they close an entire street, and the lights are everywhere, and there's  techs everywhere, and you're like, wait, why can't they just use, hey, the sun's up.  I don't know what movie it was, but back in the day, it's going to be about 10 years ago,  they were lighting up Central Park.  The building's actually on the outskirts of Central Park for some movie. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  And when you see those shots, you just think, oh, that's just a natural shot.  But they are lighting up those fucking buildings at night.  When you think of how long it takes to film something, and natural light moves, you get  the shadows moving, so they've got to light it up.  Well, this was a night shot, and I just always assumed that night shots, they just use whatever.  But they were fucking, I don't know, I never knew what movie it was, to be honest with  you, because they filmed these things a year before we see them, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  But they were lighting up, they weren't happy with how the buildings looked naturally,  so they had, just like you're saying, these lighting rigs that I've never seen before,  ridiculous, just shining on these fucking buildings for this shot.  I think those are the most amazing guys on the set.  Just to make the buildings look good.  It's fucking amazing.  What they do is fucking, because you never know, you don't notice it until it's bad.  When it's bad, you notice it.  Every movie you see has great lighting in it, and then when it's wrong, you're like,  what the fuck is wrong?  Oh.  Oh, I see.  They're amazing lighting people.  People just sit for hours waiting for the light guy and the light crew to turn something 
[00:46:00]  or put a filter on one light, and it's like an hour later, they put one filter on one  light.  It just takes forever.  Remember when they were filming I Am Legend and 7th Avenue?  That's what I meant.  Yeah, 7th Avenue had a bunch of the banners on the light poles and everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was pretty cool.  Yeah.  I want to learn more about Devil's Den.  Man, this guy, he's been in Devil's Den.  We're never there, Chip.  TJ in Michigan. 
[00:46:30]  TJ.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  You've been to Devil's Den.  Yeah, you would love it down there.  There's caverns in that place where you flash your head, there's a flashlight in there,  and you can't see it a foot away from another opening.  So when you go in there, it opens up into a big room, and the other one will open up  into a big room.  It sounds easy to get lost.  Yeah.  Well, how big is Devil's Den?  I leave a trail of breadcrumbs.  Almost ever.  Whoops. 
[00:47:00]  I took two dives down there and didn't even see a quarter of it.  Oh.  You go down as deep as it'll go, and some of the deeper caverns, they have fenced off,  and they have little statues of a devil.  So it's not in that area.  But once, it's like a bowl with a bowl over it.  So once you descend, you're always over.  Something's always over you.  But you got caverns.  Caverns.  Yeah, we got your caverns.  And then I came up and got some of that deep fish pizza. 
[00:47:30]  But if you get a chance, you guys would love it.  He's from Michigan, huh?  Sounds it.  Well, I still got to go tuna fishing before I go to Devil's fucking Den.  You know what you can do with a piano that you can't do?  If you want to see something cool, go to the Great Lakes in Michigan.  The best wreck size you can imagine.  We have an ocean here.  Thank you.  Exactly.  Those Great Lakes are pretty cool, man.  Giant puddles.  Have you seen the Edmund Fitzgerald?  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  That's too deep.  What?  What's not?  He goes, you know...  Yeah, you know that.  He goes, you know that.  It's pretty deep there.  How deep is the Edmund Fitzgerald?  How deep is the Edmund Fitzgerald?  Edmund Fitzgerald, I think, is at 2,000 feet.  Yeah, that's too deep.  You need one of those fucking subs.  They went to dive at 2,000 feet, but the ship was much too deep there.  Deep there.  That's not when you do it.  All right, TJ.  Of course you do.  Oh, my guy's still talking. 
[00:48:30]  Boy, does Michigan love to talk.  Where else should we go?  Where else?  Grand Canyon?  What do you think?  I know you've been there, but no, you guys.  Hey, obviously it's green.  You know how I talked about Wicked Tuna?  Yeah.  I love that.  I think it's Nat Geo.  Yeah.  One of the guys is a fan of the show.  No way.  And he reached out to me yesterday.  He goes, hey, man, I heard you guys talking about Wicked Tuna.  Anytime you want to go fishing.  On the Twitter?  Yeah, on the Twitter.  He reached out to me, and I'm like, fuck you. 
[00:49:00]  Let's set this up.  Yeah.  And then another guy goes, hey, that guy's boat sunk.  Really?  So now I need to know if this guy's boat sunk or not.  See?  They've roped you in.  But he's saying, look, if you want to go tuna fishing, I'll take you.  And he's one of the guys from Wicked Tuna.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But then another guy, I guess, from another boat, is like, fuck that guy.  His boat sank.  Oh, what did he tweet you?  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you about the celebrity tweet.  You got a celebrity tweet better than the Wicked Tuna guy? 
[00:49:30]  I got a celebrity DM yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Here's some news.  Uh-oh.  So, I want to thank the listeners of this very program.  Oh, no.  What problems did they fucking start?  No.  No problems.  Yeah.  No problems.  Because I got a direct message, a DM, from none other than Miss Teen USA Delaware.  No way.  Yes. 
[00:50:00]  I absolutely did.  Why?  What happened?  What did I miss?  Well, we were-  She's the one, obviously, with the sex tape.  She had a fucking-  We were talking about her yesterday.  It was fine.  We were talking about her yesterday.  Right.  And watching the video again, of course.  You got to make sure you got it right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And-  It was part of the job.  Yeah, yeah.  We were talking about her, and I was like, you know, it would be nice to get a follow.  I like my celebrity follows, and that would be a good one. 
[00:50:30]  I got the T-Mobile girl to follow me, which was nice, and a few others.  So now, I said, it would be nice if she followed me.  So the listeners took the old bull by the horns and started tweeting horrid, horrid things  about horror, the movie, me, things like that.  We talked about the white knight syndrome that goes on on Twitter, where if a girl's in trouble,  or a girl breaks up, or something like this girl's situation, these guys swoop in, you 
[00:51:00]  know, you're such a great person, because they're just trying to fucking hook up, so  shut up.  They feel like they have a shot.  White knights.  I saw it with Melissa Stetton there, when we broke up.  These guys would swoop in and go, you could do so much better than him, why were you ever  with it?  And it's like, dude, really?  Are you trying?  Shut it.  Uh, so, I was like, it would be nice to get followed.  So, um, guys took the initiative, and, uh, she, um, she apparently got all those, those 
[00:51:30]  tweets and read them.  Um, and then I got a, uh, direct message from her that was, uh, it said, um, uh, who are  you?  Oh.  With a question mark.  All right.  And, um, that's where we stand at this point.  Did you write her back?  Uh, no, I didn't.  The answer is, what are you?  And the question is, what are you?  And it's a creep.  I'm a fucking creep.  That's what I am.  But, um, yeah, that was kind of cool.  No, that's better than...  What?  That's better than Wicked Tuna Guy. 
[00:52:00]  She's still not following me.  She is.  What?  Oh, she's not following you.  No.  Why would she?  No.  She's a lovely girl.  Yeah, but guess who she is following?  No, she's not.  Oh, yeah, she is.  You're not.  Okay.  No.  Sorry.  You're lying.  Can you DM her back if she's not following you?  No.  No, that's just it.  No.  You can't.  I was very petrified there.  I was like, fuck, why isn't she...  I think she followed me for a little bit.  Yeah.  You missed it.  Got a DM and stuff like that, and then I missed the window of opportunity, so I just put a regular 
[00:52:30]  message out there like, hey, hey, you gotta follow me.  Hey, for me to get back to you.  That's hilarious.  So that's where we stand.  We'll see what happens later today.  But, yeah, but you know what?  There's been fucking Twitter contact made, and we all know that's the most important.  That can lead to something.  Part of, you know, seeing what the fuck goes on.  And I just got a tweet.  The ship is Hard Merchandise.  Hard Merchandise?  Hard Merchandise.  Is the ship that sunk?  And this guy writes, Hard Merchandise sank at the dock, but will be fixed up. 
[00:53:00]  Ooh.  In time for tuna season.  Is it tuna season now?  I have no idea when tuna season is.  You guys want to go fucking fishing for some tuna up in New England?  I am a pukey guy on a boat like that.  I can't go on those boats.  It's a lot of downtime.  I need a cruise ship before I stop woofing.  We'll get some beers.  No.  I want to be on a boat, and I obviously will not catch the tuna.  I could spear the fucker if I have to get him on the boat.  I can't go. 
[00:53:30]  They're monsters.  Have you seen how big these fucking things are?  Giant.  Giant.  And then they take a big spear and flock right in there.  They look like out-of-shape sharks.  Yeah.  Out-of-shape sharks.  Out-of-shape sharks.  Yeah.  Wow, they are big.  I want to do this.  I would love to.  But now they're competing.  They're cuking.  They're ratting each other out, like, don't go on his boat, go on mine, out of Danvis.  Danvis.  So now I got a couple invites.  That's great.  What do I do?  Do I wait for hard merchandise to get their shit back together, or do I go and jump on 
[00:54:00]  another fucking boat?  Hmm.  Huh?  Why don't you go on both?  Yeah.  Yeah, they like them.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  Both?  Sure you do.  You don't have to choose.  Yeah, go on both and see which one you like better.  Make them fucking compete.  I want to go tuna fishing.  I want to check this out.  You don't get seasick on those boats?  Uh, not so much.  I'm all right.  Where do they go out of?  I would.  Um, Gloucester.  Gloucester.  Gloucester's a biggie. 
[00:54:30]  That's where I think Wicked Tuna goes out of.  Are you going to the Flemish Cap?  I think so, yes.  Sail to the Flemish Cap.  Look how big that fucking tuna is.  Why wouldn't you want to be on a boat when they pull that in?  Ah, poor guy.  He's just trucking moping around being a tuna.  Oh my God.  Do we get to eat fresh tuna right off the fucking fish?  You know what?  You should go on the, um...  Or we got to bring that shit in so you get a fair market price.  You should go on the Andrea Gale.  What's that?  That's a great, uh, boat right there.  A long line, uh, fishing boat. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is there a joke?  Good captain.  What?  Joke.  What am I missing?  They're all dead.  It's the perfect storm boat.  Ouch.  See?  Ouch.  That's terrible.  Why would you want to do that?  Ouch.  Maybe we, uh, take a boat out of Long Island and go tuna fishing.  Hmm.  I want to be with the Wicked Tuna guys, though.  I used to go fishing with my dad, but, um, they were in a little rowboat in the Long Island  Sound.  Catching snappers?  I don't know what it was.  And sea robins?  I don't know.  That's not fishing.  I don't know what he was catching.  Because I never fished. 
[00:55:30]  Because I was too busy laying on the bottom of the boat crying.  Oh, with the crabs in your hair.  Because I had crabs in my hair.  Which, coincidentally enough.  No, it was, uh, yeah.  First of all, I was, like, sick.  So I had a tummy ache and I started crying.  And then I needed to lay down on the boat because I was seasick.  That's the worst thing to do if you're seasick.  I just, whatever.  You gotta look at that horizon, right?  I know.  I don't know what the fuck I was.  But then I'm laying down and we were using, like, crabs for bait or something.  Yeah.  And they got out of the container and they crawled in my hair. 
[00:56:00]  And I woke up with crabs in my hair and I started crying again.  How do you think they felt?  They're supposed to be ocean dwellers.  And the next thing they're just in this fucking dirty scalp.  That big afro I had.  Boom, boom, Washington hair.  You ever use squid when you were fishing?  Yeah, yeah.  I remember that at some point.  I learned only recently from my marine biologist brother that squid and calamari, same fucking thing.  Now, I know it's the same fucking thing. 
[00:56:30]  Don't get me wrong.  But when that shit comes in, they split it up.  They go, all right, half for bait, half for the restaurants.  So it's the same exact thing.  That's what I meant, yes.  I always thought there was, like, a, I don't know, maybe a higher grade or something that made it different.  But no.  My brother's like, no, man.  The squid you put on a fucking fishing line and the calamari you eat in the restaurant is the exact same thing.  See, I was angry that day, my friends.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  I can't get in small boats, though, in, you know, wavy water. 
[00:57:00]  The tuna boats aren't small.  Well, they're kind of small.  They're small.  I'm talking cruise ships I could go on because they're not, like, going back and forth like crazy like the fishing boats.  But I cannot go on charter boats.  I would love to fucking, I've had offers to go shark fishing off of Montauk and shit.  It would be great.  But I'd be puking my guts off.  What does that mean?  No, it wouldn't work.  I've tried it.  You know, you do bring back a memory when I was doing a bunch of diving. 
[00:57:30]  One of my dive trips, Turks and Caicos, they had, like, a little, you know, instructional thing on the boat as we're getting to the dive site.  Yeah.  And because I had to focus on the woman talking, giving us our instructions for the day, and then you were also trying to put your equipment on, and it was, the sea was a bit rough.  And I did fucking, me and this other chick, we're puking our brains off.  Really?  Yeah.  Out over the side of the boat.  It's a, because I had to focus on the instructor. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  I knew I was feeling a little weird, so I'm like, okay, I know I can fucking calm this shit down, but I, you know, you had to listen to the lady.  I'm like, I'm in trouble, man.  Dude, that is the fucked up thing about it.  Like, I've gone out on these boats since I was a kid, like, to go deep sea fishing or, you know, whatever, and you're standing there having fun because you want to have fun, a great time, and then out of fucking nowhere you get that whoosh.  Right.  And you're like, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, this isn't good, oh, fuck. 
[00:58:30]  And it ruined your whole time.  But you can control it.  But if you still have to, like, you know, walk around the boat to get your equipment and listen to this lady and...  Done.  Yeah, but I ended up, I was a trooper.  I ended up diving anyway.  Oh.  Once you're off the boat, you're fine.  No, I've been...  I've gotten almost seasick in the water as well.  In the water?  Yeah, man.  Wow, that's so weird.  Never.  Yeah, because you're getting kind of pushed around and sloshed around a little bit.  Not to the point where I had to puke or anything. 
[00:59:00]  I've never gotten queasy in the water.  Oh, wait, I did puke once underwater.  Really?  That is a scary feeling.  Underwater?  Yeah, you've got to puke right through your regulator and everything.  Why?  You just...  Well, I guess you could technically take it out, but you've got to fucking...  You know, you've got to be careful.  I didn't take it out.  They said you can puke with the things in your mouth still.  Holy shit.  I forgot about that.  That happened to me once, too.  Jimmy's all grossed out.  Terrible.  Why?  And then what happens is then it's like automatic fucking chum.  So then some shit starts fucking swimming around you, eating your puke as you're trying to dive. 
[00:59:30]  Try coming down here and chumming this shit for a while.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  That's something I forgot about.  That might have been all the same trip.  It might have been a little bit of a hangover or something going on.  It doesn't gum up the works?  No.  If you're going to do it through the regulator?  No.  What, is there a flap valve that it comes out through?  Oh, that's crazy.  We'd have to get some, like, real divers on.  Wow, man.  I'm a diver of the muff variety. 
[01:00:00]  I'm what they call a resort diver.  Yeah.  Because I was too lazy to fucking get certified.  So I had to go through the resort course over and over and over and over again.  But then you would get cool people that would go, look, we're only supposed to bring you  like 30, 40 feet down.  But it's obvious you know what you're doing.  So we'll let you do a little more.  Go for it.  But I should have got certified.  It would have saved me a lot of time in fucking pools.  Damn.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Should we take a break?  Yeah, we got our grub here.  We might as well.  So what should I do?  Wait for this boat to be fixed?  No.  Take the first one.  Take the boat out of Danvers?  Danvers.  Yeah, I don't know where that guy is because I didn't fucking save his tweet.  It's like, I can't help it if you wreck your fucking boat.  You know?  Yeah, but I can't wait around.  But he's kind of a celebrity.  Oh, you want to go with the celebrity?  Oh, the other guy isn't a celebrity?  No.  Oh, then fuck him.  Really?  Yeah, wait for the guy with the celebrity boat. 
[01:01:00]  I think he's a celebrity.  Demi Moore follows me?  No way.  Yeah.  That's not true.  That's Demi Tess.  Demi Tess.  I don't follow Demi Moore.  Demi Cup.  That's a bra.  Ooh.  I don't know what's going on with my Twitter.  I'm trying to find this guy.  Demi?  Hmm.  Yeah.  I lost him now.  Fuck. 
[01:01:30]  Fuck.  Where is he?  Hold on one second.  Yeah.  The listeners need to, like, launch the second wave to get me followed.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I fucking, you know.  I don't know.  All right.  It worked.  It worked with the T-Mobile girl.  I lost Wicked Tuna Guy, because that's something I really absolutely definitely want to do.  I want to be on a tuna boat.  All right.  I'd have to be out there all day.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  But as soon as they catch one, they have to bring it in quickly.  Oh, yeah.  Because that meat, they've got to keep it fresh.  All right.  For the sushi chefs.  A sushi chef?  Yes.  I everything.  I a sushi chef.  Yeah.  Who's coming in today?  Miz?  The Miz.  The Miz is coming in.  Mm-hmm.  I saw Jimmy tweeting about the old age home lady.  Oh, yeah.  That's a fucked story.  And I was watching one of the news programs yesterday, just laying around in my own filth. 
[01:02:30]  And the 911 call, did anyone else hear this?  Oh, yeah.  Did you guys play it yesterday?  Nope.  We'll play it next for everyone.  It's enraging.  It's so fucking sick.  I mean, I got a, my mom's at one of these places.  Mm-hmm.  And you just always, you wonder if the, if the people around her give a shit.  Give a shit.  And usually the answer is no.  You think?  Yeah.  There might be something else.  It might, these people are absolutely disgusting, but there's one more thing that might be a part  of it.  Have you heard the 911 call? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  How defiant this, this lady at the home is?  It made my jaw, like I wanted to bite her fucking face.  Yeah.  And that fucking person she works with.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Jeffrey Toomer, his name is.  I know.  It's funny how this always works out, right?  It's not.  You, you know the, the baby that was, uh, cured of AIDS?  Uh-huh.  Where was that?  Down in, um, I forgot already.  Alabama?  You know the doctor?  Mississippi?  The doctor that was involved in that case?  Yeah.  What her, what her last name was?  AIDS? 
[01:03:30]  Gay.  Gay?  How does that work out always?  The name is gay and you become an AIDS doctor.  That's pretty fucking.  But how does that always work out?  It's the weirdest fucking thing.  Jesus.  If that was true, my name would be fucking Jimmy Big Cock.  Boom.  Oh, God.  My, my, my back doctor?  Yeah.  You want to guess what his name is?  Bobby Spine?  Bobby Spine.  Jesus, that's crazy.  Isn't that weird?  What a coincidence.  Actually, and I swear to you, his name is Dr. Bendo. 
[01:04:00]  Bendo?  How does that work out?  Bendo.  I swear that's his real name.  And I even said, okay, what's going on here?  Yeah, what's the gag here, Doc?  You changed your name because this is the profession you're in just to make it easier for everyone.  He goes, no, it's actually my, my given name.  Meh.  What's the gag, Doc?  But yeah, the, the, the lady doctor that was involved with the, the AIDS baby there that  was cured or whatever, her last name was Gay.  She was all over the news programs.  I'm like, come on, really?  Another Dr. Gay?  Yeah, right.  Wait a minute. 
[01:04:30]  And we have our own Dr. Gay here.  Prove me right, Sam.  Prove me right.  Dr. Gay.  Are you proving me right yet?  There she is.  Dr. Hannah Gay.  Dr. Hannah Gay was the doctor that was very close to the, the, the AIDS baby that was cured.  AIDS baby.  AIDS baby or whatever.  There she is.  Look at this thing.  I keep praying the HIV stays gone.  Well, I bet you do.  Dr. Gay.  Nice.  Let's eat, huh? 
[01:05:00]  How about that?  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is my last broadcast as the anchorman of the CBS Evening News.  For me, it's a moment for which I long have planned, but which nevertheless comes with some sadness.  For almost two decades, after all, we've been meeting like this in the evenings.  And I'll miss that.  But those who have made anything of this departure, I'm afraid have made too much. 
[01:05:30]  Old anchorman, you see, don't fade away.  They just keep coming back for more.  And that's the way it is.  Friday, March 6th, 1981.  I'll be away on assignment.  Dan Rather will be sitting in here for the next few years.  Good night.  Walter Cronkite.  Signed off 32 years ago.  No way.  It was that long ago? 
[01:06:00]  Walter Cronkite.  I equate Walter Cronkite with the Vietnam War.  I remember when I was talking about the Vietnam War and the second venture.  JFK, right?  With the glasses.  Yes.  He wiped a little tear away.  Yeah.  When he announced that President Kennedy...  I watched that whole thing.  I told you it was a two-hour thing on whatever channel he was on.  And it was just not that moment, but it was the whole thing of coverage.  And it was really moving. 
[01:06:30]  See, there's one point where he says, the newsflash, President Kennedy has been assassinated.  Those words were so indisputable.  It was really a chilling thing to hear a guy say.  Unfortunately, the president's head wasn't moving, you know?  If he would have bobbed and weaved a little.  Been in that back brace.  That stupid back brace.  He grabs his neck.  He might have lived.  Like he's given the fucking...  That's the universal sign that I need the Heimlich maneuver, isn't it?  Yeah.  Or he looked like when Private Pyle was choking himself at first. 
[01:07:00]  Choke yourself!  Private Pyle goes like this.  Not with your hair.  Don't make me laugh.  That's what he fucking looked like, a dummy.  His soul was blown out, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was fucking...  Yeah, he would have been...  He might have lived.  He would have been...  My flesh.  That fucking crack!  And just...  Like a melon.  Oh, did that come apart.  And it absolutely looks like it came from the front. 
[01:07:30]  I mean, it's so...  It does.  I know you...  I've seen and heard so many stories about why it looks that way, even though it was hit  from the back.  But man, when you watch that, it just...  It absolutely looks like that shot hit him square in the fucking forehead.  Until you see the shot from the back.  When you see the one shot that was shown in a different light, it's like a...  Whatever.  Not x-ray, but you can see the head going forward.  Yeah, yeah.  You can see the shit coming out the front that way.  That's fucked up, right?  Amazing.  Anyway.  There you go. 
[01:08:00]  We lost Paul Bearer.  Sam Roberts?  Oh, boy.  Yes, last night.  For real?  Yeah, he's dead now.  Paul Bearer is dead?  Paul Bearer, of course.  You remember Paul Bearer.  He hung around with The Undertaker back in the heyday of wrestling?  He was the guy that used to come out with The Undertaker.  Meaning when we used to watch?  Yeah.  He had the urn, and he'd walk out, and he did all of The Undertaker's talking, right?  Yeah, well, The Undertaker didn't say a word.  He's a dead man.  Not a fucking peep.  He still doesn't talk? 
[01:08:30]  And he'd go, I think that you...  It was all, you know, it was supposed to be creepy.  Way more high-pitched, though.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, it was.  The Undertaker...  Oh, yeah.  Does he talk now?  Uh, yeah.  A little bit?  Yeah.  So what happened to Paul Bearer?  I don't know.  They haven't exactly said what...  I mean, he was a...  Oh, he looked horrible back in the day.  Yeah, he was never...  He was only 58?  He was 58 years old.  I stopped watching wrestling 12 years ago, and so he was only in his 40s? 
[01:09:00]  Are you kidding me?  He always seemed way older.  He did, right?  He was not in good shape, ever.  No.  Wow, 58.  He wasn't a wrestler.  No.  He would butt in sometimes and hit people with that fucking urn.  Well, with the...  Yeah, you couldn't trust him.  No.  Unlike most wrestling, like, managers and stuff like that, man.  People that bring the wrestler out, you could trust those guys.  They never pull anything.  Is Vince McMahon trying to get the dead body for some kind of fucking storyline?  Display.  Oh, you actually interviewed Paul Bearer, Sam Roberts. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, Sam.  Yeah, I'm going to upload the full one later, but this is just a clip.  Wow.  What did you ask Paul Bearer?  I kept asking him questions in character, and he wouldn't stay in character.  Oh, you fuck.  Why would he stay in character?  What else does he have to do?  I don't know.  Where did you see him?  Wrestling show?  Yeah.  Well, wrestling's been really good, and I'm looking to diversify my portfolio with...  Yeah.  What?  What?  I think I asked him, did you feel guilty for putting the Ultimate Warrior in a casket?  And he said, no, because we made a lot of money. 
[01:10:00]  And I was like, oh, what?  Come on, dude.  Yeah, man, you're trying to fucking help him out.  What's his real name, by the way?  I think it's something Moody.  William Moody?  Something Moody.  Moody.  Moody.  Hey, Moody.  BM.  Big Moody.  You want to see...  I don't know if you want to hear the clip.  Sure.  Why not?  Just asking him about being buried in cement.  All right.  Sling, you were managing The Undertaker for Lord knows how long.  Everybody has their stories of being injured. 
[01:10:30]  How bad was it for you to be buried in cement?  Well, I don't know if we've got time to explain all that, but believe you me, I didn't get buried  in cement all the way over my head.  Thank goodness.  I had to take it to about here, and they had a stunt double.  What?  From Hollywood that came in, and he took it the rest of the way, because that was a very  dangerous, very dangerous stunt.  Vince had him killed.  I know.  Vince had him killed for spilling the beans.  You know, great cavefabe. 
[01:11:00]  What are you doing?  He's letting all my secrets out.  He's letting all my secrets out.  That man's got to die.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, man.  He just sounds like some guy.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  They should just bury him in that sinkhole down there in Florida.  What is that Vince song?  That's his theme song.  What is it?  No chains.  No chains.  There, there, there.  WWE wrote it.  Yeah.  Apparently, they said he had complained to his friends that he was feeling ill as of late, 
[01:11:30]  and he had canceled a few signings.  Oh, boy.  And then all of a sudden.  That's it for Paul Bearer.  Goodbye.  He was, he was a big deal for a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's one of the big dealers.  When was the last time he was on TV for wrestling?  Uh, I mean, it was in the 2000s, for sure.  So it's been a while, though.  That was kind of cool, like, uh, back in the olden days, uh, where somebody would just  be mouthing off in the ring.  Oh, thank you for that.  And you'd just hear, bong, that bell would fucking, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, 
[01:12:00]  here comes the Undertaker.  Come on!  It's just so huge.  Is wrestling as good as it used to be?  No!  Yeah, I mean, oh, boy.  It's not, Sam, right?  It's good.  It's good for kids.  It still has an audience, but I actually tuned in for the first time in a long time because  people were saying it was old school, raw or something, so they bring back some old  guys.  And I tuned in to see some wrestler.  This is what I know, Sam.  Some wrestler that came out, but he won't wrestle until they get his name right or something. 
[01:12:30]  And then I'm like, I'm like, forget this shit.  And I turned it off, so I never got to see any of the old time guys come back.  He's a salsa dancer named Fandango.  Yeah, Fandango.  Okay, yes, that's exactly who it was.  But he won't wrestle until they properly announce his name is Fandango.  And so the guy...  Fandango?  Yeah, so the one guy tried, but it still wasn't good enough, so then he walks away and he  doesn't wrestle.  I'm like, what nonsense is this? 
[01:13:00]  That was his debut, too.  Oh, that was?  Yeah.  Well, that's his gimmick, though.  He did it on Friday, too.  Okay.  I can't be bothered.  He's going to debut tonight.  Fandango.  I know back in the day...  What was the lady's name that gave birth to a hand?  So I know...  I know...  May Young.  May Young.  So I know the storylines can get a little wacky, but...  Well, May Young.  I'm not going to deal with Fandango.  What they did, like, on the 20th anniversary or something, they had a guy dress up as a  hand...  Yeah, I know.  ...and introduce himself as May Young's teenage hand son. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  How fucking ridiculous.  So stupid.  It depends on what your tolerance for stupidity is.  I want the Fandango.  I'm not in.  I'm in.  I'm still waiting.  They had a chance to get me back.  I'm like, you know what?  I think I saw you tweeting about old-time fucking wrestlers coming back.  So I'm like, I would like to see some of the old guys.  And then...  Fandango walks out.  Oh, and I saw Triple H, too.  He shaved his head or something?  Yeah.  When did that happen?  Well, he shaved... 
[01:14:00]  He hasn't wrestled since the summer.  Right.  Shaved his head right after that.  Right.  But he's coming back to work with Brock Lesnar.  He was known for his hair, right?  And he shaved his head.  Yeah, he shaved it off.  Wow.  CEO style now.  It's like fucking Laszlo.  Yeah.  Did the same thing.  Crazy.  Yeah, but that was because water was taking over his fucking house.  He couldn't wash his hair.  Is that it?  He freaked out.  Not any water.  He's a changed man.  Oh, yeah.  Undertaker's working our buddy CM Punk at WrestleMania.  Really? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  That'd be cool.  Yeah.  Well, we got The Miz coming in today at 930.  And 125 days is back.  That's how...  I mean, the wrestler death clock ended before because we had passed 100 days.  Right.  But even since the last one, it was 125 days.  Yeah, that bit went for a while, though, man.  Oh, years.  So who was the last wrestler to die before Paul Bearer?  Brad Armstrong.  No idea.  And who before him?  Mike Graham.  No idea.  And then Chief J. Strongbow, you know?  Chief J. Strongbow.  Yeah.  I used to love the Chief J. Strongbow. 
[01:15:00]  I got a massage from a girl who looked like Chief J. Strongbow.  Sex.  Digging her knuckle into my asshole.  It was fucking heaven on earth.  That's great.  Brad Armstrong died at 51, and his cause of death is undisclosed medical distress.  Oh, boy.  Medical distress?  Oh, my God, man.  Yeah, it's a little rough.  And Paul Bearer's official cause of death.  That's going to be a heart attack, you've got to think.  Oh, poor guy.  Yeah, I mean, he's never been in good health.  And Chief J. Strongbow, though, made it to old age.  83. 
[01:15:30]  83.  83.  And he was always an out-of-shape engine.  Yeah.  Engine.  An out-of-shape engine.  Engine.  He looked horrendous in the ring.  Yeah.  Always.  And he made it to 83.  So.  Nice.  Yes.  Well, bon voyage.  Paul Bearer.  Paul Bearer.  Yeah.  Bon voyage.  Can I see a...  This is the guy who makes it to 80. 
[01:16:00]  Holy shit.  How does that work?  That's Danny Aiello.  Yeah, it looks like Chief J in his prime there.  Everybody else is all jacked up and looking like a specimen.  Yeah.  Well, we know why.  They're falling early, Sam.  Yeah, Chief J had a healthy lifestyle.  What nationality was he?  He wasn't an Indian, right?  I think he was Italian or something.  He might have been just an Italian, yeah.  When he would do this stupid thing.  Do you see a video of him going in a circle?  It's embarrassing when you look back on it.  You think?  No.  I mean, Bob Backlum was always the guy to beat. 
[01:16:30]  What?  Yeah.  For a little bit.  Bob Backlum.  Greatest wrestler.  He's probably the biggest wrestler ever.  No.  I would put Ivan Putzky right up there myself.  Putzky was, too.  The Polish Hammer.  Come on.  Yeah.  The Polish Hammer.  Yes.  That was pretty good.  Let's see Chief J enter the room.  The ring.  Let me do that.  From Brooklyn to 237.  Jose Estrada.  See, like, wrestling is much better than this right now.  Jose Estrada.  That was a big one.  This is not exciting.  This is one of the matches we're going on forever. 
[01:17:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Or less.  Wearing the stupid singlets.  Mm-hmm.  Singlets.  Yeah, Chief J Strongbow having some fringe on his boots.  Which was a big...  Whoa, look at him.  That's a lot of flinch.  This is horrible.  Oh, I forgot the frisking.  And then while he's getting frisked, Jose Estrada just starts beating on Chief J Strongbow.  And the ref doesn't stop it.  Yeah.  And the ref caused that.  Wouldn't he say, wait a minute here? 
[01:17:30]  Look how out of shape he is.  He's fucking terrible.  He's horrendous.  He's getting hyped up, though.  And what year is this?  This has got to be like the 70s.  Oh, yeah.  This is 1982.  All right.  Early 80s.  Trying to get back in the ring, but he keeps getting kicked out with his horrible body.  Horrible body.  Yeah.  His hair is barely hanging on.  He looks like Sonny's wife in Dog Day Afternoon.  He just looks horrendous.  I just don't understand this strategy, Jose Estrada.  I mean, you can't beat a guy unless he's in the ring. 
[01:18:00]  No.  Look, enough with your wrestling talk.  The only reason we brought it up was The Miz is coming in.  Yeah.  Why is he coming in?  He's the star of The Marine 3.  Oh, right on.  What the hell is that?  The Marine 3.  That's the third installment of the Marine series.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  Okay.  You may remember The Marine 1 starring John Cena.  That was Cena.  Or The Marine 2 starring Ted DiBiase Jr.  Oh.  Was it?  Yeah.  Terrific.  Was Virgil Jr. in it?  That would have been interesting.  So The Miz is taking over the franchise. 
[01:18:30]  He's taking over the franchise, yeah.  It's answering some of the unanswered questions.  Yeah, yeah.  Was he on Road Rules or Real World?  I always forget.  He was on Real World and then he was a star on The Challenge.  Yeah, he was a star on The Challenge.  He used to do all of them.  I used to like The Challenge for a little while there.  Huh.  And he was a fan.  Mm-hmm.  I bring it up every time.  First time we met The Miz, he was a reality guy.  He was barely a star and he was a huge fan of our radio show.  And then he becomes pretty big.  And now he's massive.  Well, he was like a little mid-carder and he did the Traveling Virus Tour. 
[01:19:00]  He was on...  No, I remember when he told us he was going into wrestling.  He was going to wrestling school and all that.  I remember this from the NAW days.  Yeah.  Because he was a fan of ours.  So, you know, we always take interest in that.  And I was thinking to myself, wow.  That doesn't seem like a great career path.  Yeah, well.  I thought maybe he could squeeze out a couple more reality shows.  And it worked out for him.  He's like one of the biggest guys now.  It's a good thing you didn't say that out loud.  You would have put that on your shelf next to The Rocks.  You would never be as famous as we are. 
[01:19:30]  I did say...  No, you didn't say it to The Rock.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we had it out with him because he called us out on some stuff.  And I was trying to tell him we had nothing to do with it.  And we were kind of blindsided that day as well.  So, it got heated.  And I actually said...  No, I didn't say it to his face, I don't think.  It was after he left or over on the phone or...  I don't remember.  You said it on the air, though.  Yeah, I said he'll never be as...  Well, I said...  What'd you say?  I said The Rock will never be as famous as me and Anthony. 
[01:20:00]  Yep.  You can call him.  He is the biggest action star in Hollywood.  Yeah.  For many years, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This isn't a fucking...  There's no fluke here.  We've been rotting away for the last eight years.  And he's made movie after movie after movie.  Now he's leading the G.I. Joe franchise in this latest movie.  But let the record show, we're way past that.  We're friends again.  He's been on many times since then.  Right. 
[01:20:30]  We are.  We're totally cool.  There's no issue there whatsoever.  Oh, yeah.  We worked that out.  A little bit behind the scenes, a little bit on the air.  We're all good, but...  And he likes somebody's comedy.  Yeah.  He loves the Norton.  Oh, that's right.  The Rock says.  Yeah, it does.  I wish the Les wrestlers liked comedy.  Why?  Because they all come in here, and they're all fans of Jim.  They really are.  You know how it is?  It's just a bunch of guys with similar alpha males bonding.  And then they text.  Yeah.  They text Jimmy. 
[01:21:00]  Sometimes.  Who texted you?  Let's see how my text.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, same point.  Jericho.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  Jericho.  It didn't start out nice between Norton and Jericho.  No.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  That was a wrong one.  We're way past that one, too.  Yeah, yeah.  That was weird, huh?  Fucking wrestlers are ornery.  They are.  Well, they're those alpha male things.  They also don't get taken seriously throughout life.  Holy fuck.  I forgot about the Chris Jericho and Norton thing.  They don't want to hear fake.  That was a little rough for a little bit. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Now they're pals.  Now they're on roast together and all sorts of shit.  That was a long argument, too.  That was like a 45-minute long fight.  Patrice was in that day, I remember.  Patrice was in?  Yep.  That was the old XM studio.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah, I really like Chris.  It's funny how you start off fucking arguing with somebody.  And then it turns around.  Yeah, yeah.  I genuinely like him.  You guys talk about Rodman and that fucking North Carolina shit?  We certainly did. 
[01:22:00]  Holy shit.  Why are they taking him seriously?  Well, Dennis Rodman's a goofball.  He really is.  And, in my humble opinion, a raging alcoholic.  I've seen the Celebrity Rehab and the fucking Sober House.  Which one was he on?  He's in Celebrity Rehab, but he also drinks his face off on The Apprentice.  He does, right?  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And how the fuck did he get so close to the...  He's a Bulls fan, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, Kim Jong-in wants to change his image. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  So he figured the worm is the guy that can bring his personality.  And the fact that he's just a guy that just likes basketball.  And Obama?  Call him.  Yeah.  You know, him delivering the message to Obama to just pick up the phone.  And call him.  He's a good guy.  He's only 28.  Not only a good guy, he's awesome, he said.  Yeah, Rodman said all that.  Awesome.  Does he understand what this guy does to his own fucking people? 
[01:23:00]  Well, we do it, too.  That's what Rodman said.  And then, of course, he was called out on that and didn't really have a good answer.  However, I still hated Stephanopoulos for that smug fucking jizz boy interview he gave.  And I'm tired of the U.S. not communicating with guys like this.  Because we fucking have dog shit friends when it's convenient for us.  Which is fine to have them, but just be consistent.  Don't be self-righteous.  Stephanopoulos.  He's hateable.  Yeah, I don't like him at all. 
[01:23:30]  His fucking Ivy League boy face.  Yeah.  Douchebag.  That face is so punchable.  Oh, it's fucking...  Like his fist was dangling.  So punchable.  Yeah.  But I don't think North Korea will bomb the U.S. now that this guy knows Dennis Rodman lives here.  He knows why I bombed Dennis Rodman.  And he doesn't know for sure where Rodman lives, so he's not going to bomb the U.S. anytime.  So what did he say about the war?  The guy doesn't like war. 
[01:24:00]  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing.  Say it again.  He don't want that.  He don't want that.  But he said it in a certain way.  It's like, war, he don't want that.  He don't want that.  He don't want that.  He don't want that.  One thing you don't want.  One thing you don't want.  One thing you don't want.  War.  It's like, oh, okay.  That's good.  Here you go.  Take Dennis Rodman's word for it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then that smug John Kerry's talking about how Rodman's a good basketball player, but that old gag.  Yeah, yeah.  Like they have to take this whole thing seriously. 
[01:24:30]  I went down.  He got farther than John Kerry got.  He got farther than me.  Yeah, that's got to piss off John Kerry, right?  That he doesn't get to sit down.  He said he don't want to do war.  He don't want to do that.  He don't want to do war.  He don't want to do that.  That's the one thing.  He don't want to do war.  He don't want to do war.  Well, we got the 911 call from the nurse refusing to perform CPR on the dying lady.  It's enraged.  Yeah.  I saw your tweets.  Jimmy was outraged.  However, I hear she's not a nurse. 
[01:25:00]  Rather saying she's not a nurse.  Do you know what's the whole story?  The old lady fell down, I guess.  At one of these homes, right?  Called Glenwood Gardens in Bakersfield, California.  I don't know her name.  It hasn't been released, but it will come out.  But she fell down in the public area of the home?  Yeah.  Because there were a lot of people around?  I think so, yeah.  It seemed like it.  And they don't provide medical assistance.  Their policy is to call 911 and wait for medical attention. 
[01:25:30]  Why is that?  It's just part of the way they have it said.  Probably so they can't get sued.  They're not liable.  Maybe they're not medical personnel.  I don't know.  You think it's the lawyers getting their bullshit in there?  Of course they do.  Of course.  Bullshit in there.  So they're like, we can't help these people.  Because in the end, we'll get fucked.  But I've also heard this woman had a DNR, a do not resuscitate.  Right.  I thought she had a GNR.  And she was like, fucking...  What's that?  Oh, that's Paradise City.  Listens to Paradise City when she's dying. 
[01:26:00]  I don't know.  But with a DNR, will you let someone just die?  I guess they will.  But then I've heard she didn't have a do not resuscitate.  So I don't know what the story was.  I think that this person was being awful and detached.  Yeah, yeah.  Completely detached.  That's the way to do it.  Apparently, the family, though, says that she did.  They're not going to sue.  That the woman didn't want to be resuscitated.  And they have no problem with what happened.  Boy, she must have been a fuck of a burden on the family for them to just go, 
[01:26:30]  Ah, it's good.  We won't sue.  Thank God she's gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just that she's so hateable, though, in this 911 call.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because this is do not resuscitate.  She's doing her job to not resuscitate.  But she should have said, look, she has a do not resuscitate.  I can't do it.  But what was her issue?  She just collapsed.  Oh, I don't know.  I'm going to guess.  At 87, it could have been hard or something.  I'm just not sure.  She's getting old and collapses, and then she stops breathing.  But do not resuscitate.  I mean, does that mean just basic shit, too?  I don't know. 
[01:27:00]  I think it is.  Like basic CPR or something?  Yeah.  I think so.  I think so.  Ugh.  Like she cuts her arm and starts bleeding.  You're like, nah, I'm not even going to sew that up.  Doctors let her bleed out.  Yeah, but he's in.  Ah, palliative care and ah, end of life.  Ah, end of life.  Care to not resuscitate.  Dying with the dignity of that.  Ah, right.  People just don't want to drag down forever.  That's sick.  Just soak a cloth with your wine and put it over her fucking nose and mouth.  Where is Dr. Sheev?  He wrote me yesterday. 
[01:27:30]  Let's see.  I'm heading to the Dominican Republic.  Oh, wow.  What the hell is he doing there?  He'll be back in a week.  Oh, wow.  And then I said, hey, tell me about it.  Because I've always wondered about the Dominican Republic.  He writes, will do.  It's pretty much a third world country banana republic with four star and five star resorts  on a couple of beaches.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Dominican Republic is on that side.  Haiti's on the other.  Oh, it's one of those?  It's the same island.  It's just a border.  An imaginary line in the middle. 
[01:28:00]  Well, yet Dominican Republic has its resorts and an economy and Haiti is a fucking disaster.  Iraq coming?  They have that thing, too, where the Dominican Republic will bring the Haitians over to work  and then they're escorted back over to Haiti to make sure that they leave.  Get your fucking ass out of here, they say.  Get out of here.  I don't know what the heck's going on.  I just got to get out of Seaside Heights.  I have a Zeppeli.  I don't know all this monkey business overseas.  What the hell do I know? 
[01:28:30]  I'm going to paint her a coffee.  Ah, shit.  A lot of phone calls.  We don't have to go to them.  But what they're saying is, I used to work as an EMT.  There was a lot of neglect when I was an EMT guy.  This particular nursing home, they know there is a DNR.  Eric in Jersey.  I worked in a retirement home in Jersey.  All the issues are because of lawyers.  Of course they are.  Yeah, of course.  Fucking lawyers.  Of course.  But this lady's still hateable.  We're going to play the call in a second.  Yes, she's fucking completely. 
[01:29:00]  I was a medic.  I could give a real honest opinion about this.  I bet.  I bet when they bring the family member there, they have to fill out a fuckload of paperwork  and completely sign away the fact that they know that if something happens, they will,  to the best of their ability, contact emergency workers, and they can come in and do that.  But they themselves, the staff, will not do anything.  And if they sign that away, it's not even an issue of legality.  I don't think there's any legal culpability.  Right, right. 
[01:29:30]  That's what I mean.  I thought that's probably why they do it.  The moral, yeah.  Sorry.  Someone else is saying if there's a DNR, they don't call 911.  Really?  Yeah.  If there's a DNR, they don't call 911.  And then we got this guy, John of Virginia.  Go ahead, John.  Maybe they're obligated to call 911 if it's in a public area, if they fall.  Who knows?  Well, we got a doctor that's going to explain the whole DNR status.  But first, John of Virginia, go, John.  Quick.  Hey, Chad.  Hey.  I was a medic for years, and I was in an area where there's a lot of nursing homes. 
[01:30:00]  This happens a lot more than what you think it is.  And it's not calloused.  It is not cruel.  This person probably did have a DNR.  And depending on where the area is, it also depends on whether you're going to call an ambulance or a rescue squad.  It also really depends on the Medicare, Medicaid, as to whether you're going to call an ambulance or a rescue squad.  But the area that they were in, the way the rescue squad gets paid, they may have called a rescue squad instead of an ambulance company for a DNR. 
[01:30:30]  This person was in assisted living.  They may have had a DNR.  The person may have started to code AA, started to die.  They may have taken this person to a quiet area.  Now, what they were calling a nurse may have been a CNA or an NA, a nurse's aide.  Not a real nurse, just somebody who wipes an ass when somebody shits.  And no, she is not going to perform CPR.  That is not her job.  Can I ask you a question?  I know you're right, it's not her job. 
[01:31:00]  But as a person, and the 911 operator says you're not liable.  You can't get sued.  We take responsibility.  No jury in the world would have convicted this woman for doing anything wrong.  Yes, they would have.  An elderly person's bones are brittle.  Now, what happens if that young lady starts performing CPR, and she accidentally breaks a rib.  Improperly and stuff.  Of course, you could still.  It punches her heart, or it punches her lung. 
[01:31:30]  And they say, well, if you wouldn't have performed CPR, it wasn't your job.  You were told not to perform CPR.  They punctured her lung.  What if you caused the damage that killed her, not what originally was what made her start to code?  Yeah, I wouldn't touch the old bitch either, fucker.  Yeah, I still don't believe that.  It's all this fear of lawyers and getting sued.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, the point is that woman is so hateable.  She's just let her die.  That's what we are as a society.  We're so afraid of getting sued that we, and I wanted to write something about this on Facebook,  but I just don't know all the facts, but we kind of do, this is, it's a microcosm of what we are. 
[01:32:00]  This instance is, we're so litigious, and we're all out to grab money from each other.  People are petrified.  But lawyers don't do it in a vacuum.  They're fucking, we go to lawyers, and they come to us, and we sign on.  So we have brought this on ourselves.  This fucking completely detached, hateable behavior is brought on by us.  Also, if you look at it, the daughter of the woman is a nurse. 
[01:32:30]  She understands the game.  She understands how things happened.  She said she understood what happened.  Her mother had a DNR.  She understands what the young lady did.  She's not mad or upset about it.  But did she have a DNR?  Because I've heard she didn't.  I have heard that she did have a DNR.  I have heard that she did not have a DNR.  Either way, the mother knew what rules were in place.  She is not upset.  Just some jackass happened to find this 911 call.  That happens thousands of times a day, every day, and wanted to make a deal with it. 
[01:33:00]  But I mean, how often do you have the...  Just like that damn airplane whose landing gear happened to get stuck, and they wanted  to make a big deal about it, and all of a sudden it was in the hangar the other day.  And they're like, oh, the airplane's in the hangar.  Okay.  Yeah, just like that.  They just happened to find information one day about something that happens every day.  Well, I think the thing with this that's bothersome is the fact that the 911 operator is saying,  will somebody help this woman just as a person, and this fucking cunt, and as a person, like 
[01:33:30]  what she was showing us is this is what corporate...  I'm not talking about a DNR, or do not resuscitate.  I'm talking about the fear of being sued, or like you said, I wouldn't try to help the  old lady, unless she had a DNR, and it wasn't her wishes.  How long has that 911 operator been a 911 operator?  How long have they known how this really works?  How much training did that person have?  Had that person been in training, and their trainer just went up to take a piss? 
[01:34:00]  I think what's bothering a lot of people...  All right, all right, all right!  Jesus, you just keep plowing through everybody.  We get your point, sir.  I'm exhausted.  I'm just saying, I have been on this side of this argument before, and I've been made  to look like an asshole before.  But you're not having a conversation.  What I was going to try to tell you is what bothers a lot of people.  There wasn't really a human emotion or a feeling from this lady as the 911 operator was talking  to her.  And that's what's bothersome to a lot of people today. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  She's terrible.  All right.  There's a DNR, but you could do something to comfort the lady.  Do something to make it look like you're a human fucking being.  Satin pillow.  Get her used to it.  She was just a corporate annoying woman, and I don't care what job you have.  If you're afraid of losing your job while someone's dying on the floor, and you're not  going to attempt to do anything, to me, it's a problem in this country because we're so  afraid of...  There's something called the Good Samaritan Law, which means that you're not going to get 
[01:35:00]  in trouble if someone's in deep trouble.  You try to help them, and you make matters worse, I believe.  Right.  So doesn't that apply here?  The thing of it is, though, if you work in the EMS or the medical field where you work  hands-on with the patient, and you wanted to get emotionally attached to every single  patient to where you put your job into jeopardy for every single patient, you're going to lose  your job very quickly.  But I don't think that's getting too emotionally attached, performing CPR while the operator 
[01:35:30]  is saying, could you get somebody who will do this?  Is there anyone who will help this woman?  That's why we called 911.  Everyone there is told not to do it.  Exactly.  That's the point I'm making.  It's these fucking lawyers, and these fucking lawyers are a reflection of us.  Lawyers, again, the lawyers are not the ones who are at fault.  It's the greedy, cunty Americans who are just suing each other, and the second we can,  we go after the insurance companies for every little thing, so we kind of deserve it.  All right, John, we're going to let you go.  Thanks for showing us the other side there. 
[01:36:00]  We've got a doctor on the line, Dr. Corey in Cleveland.  Go ahead, Doc.  Hey, boys.  Good evening.  Yes, Dr. Corey.  And that's how you perform CPR.  What can you add to the discussion here, Doc?  So I work in a hospital in Cleveland.  Congratulations.  We do radio show.  That's right.  Most of the time, I'm inpatient.  A lot of times, I work in the ICU, so I deal with this CNR and code status quite a bit. 
[01:36:30]  And it seems that the other guy was very right as far as if the person doesn't want it done  and you do it, you can actually be held legal for assault.  Held legal?  Yeah.  You can be put in jail for that.  Is it Dr. Corey or Dr. Borey?  Dr. Corny.  Go ahead, doctor.  He just goes, hey.  I'm along the same lines as Dr. Steve.  I'm actually training as a palliative medicine doctor.  No one cares.  No one cares.  That's like the worst doctor ever because what's the worst that could happen? 
[01:37:00]  They got a pulse.  Exactly.  Yeah.  But what you can do is if you start doing CPR on a patient and their family doesn't want it done,  they'll come into the room.  They'll find out everybody who was in the room and they'll sue every single person.  Sue everyone.  Sue everyone.  For palliative care here.  So what's your point?  My point is that you can't just, I mean, the person was right in the fact that they didn't do CPR,  and if they did do CPR, then there'd be major legal issues, then they'd be probably sued. 
[01:37:30]  The entire place would probably be sued as well.  Okay.  All right.  I know what major legal issues.  They're not trained medical staff.  Well, even trained medical staff.  I mean, in the ICU, there's a lot of patients who, they don't want intubation, they don't want CPR,  they don't want anything done.  So when they go, we just let them go.  Well, this woman did say, her family is saying that she personally selected Glenwood Gardens  knowing that they didn't have a trained medical staff, which I don't care about that. 
[01:38:00]  There's a human connection.  But that she wanted to die naturally without any kind of life-prolonging intervention.  So maybe that was why they didn't interfere.  I don't know.  Yeah, perhaps.  And I think Jimmy's taking this very personally.  You're taking this very personally, Jimmy.  You heard the call.  She's a hateable woman.  Yeah.  But she said at the DNR, I can't do it.  That's different.  Yeah, let's play the call.  Thank you, Dr. Corey.  Let's go to the call.  Yeah, we finally got some info there. 
[01:38:30]  And now here's the call.  Okay, that's not, we need to get CPR started.  That's not enough.  Okay.  Let me.  Yeah, we can't do CPR.  Okay, then hand the phone to the passerby.  If you can't do it, I need to hand it to the passerby.  I'll have her do it.  Or if you've got any citizens there, I'll have them.  No.  Anybody there can do CPR.  Give them the phone, please.  I understand if your facility is not willing to do that, give the phone to that.  I love this, though.  There's a lot of the call missing, too. 
[01:39:00]  This is great.  Anyone else here?  Lily Tomlin?  Is she actually?  Hello.  One ringy.  Sounds like Lily Tomlin.  Pass the vibe of that stranger that has it then.  I need, this woman's not breathing enough.  She's going to die if we don't get this started.  Do you understand?  I understand.  Okay.  I am a nurse, but I cannot have our other senior citizens who don't know CPR.  I will instruct them in a dining room.  I will instruct them.  It's the coldness of this. 
[01:39:30]  She's just everything you hate about the medical profession is in this woman.  There she is.  What?  Left to die.  It's the coldness of the nurse in this phone call.  I like it.  It's like time is of the essence.  She's like, look, I'm not going to have one of our elderly patients.  Patients.  She's just taking her sweet-ass time.  Yep.  She don't give a fuck.  Not the least fuck. 
[01:40:00]  I will instruct them.  Is there anyone there who's with that?  Okay.  I don't understand why you're not willing to help this patient.  I am.  Okay, great.  Then I'll walk you through it all.  EMS takes the liability for this, Colleen.  I'm happy to help you.  Okay?  This is EMS protocol.  Okay?  I don't know where he is, but she's yelling at me and saying that we have to have one  of our other residents perform CPR and still instruct, and I'm not going to do that. 
[01:40:30]  And what is that call?  Colleen, is there...  They're having this discussion.  What's going on with the lady?  I'm dying.  This is what the country we live in.  This one's dying.  She's like, I'm not going to have that conversation.  Is there a lady, like, feet away from her?  And it's, uh, yeah, I'm going to have to...  You're going to have to come in.  Yeah, let me just convey this entire conversation I just had with this person while, you know,  time ticks away.  Monday or Sunday, you're going to have to come in, son.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to need you to go ahead and give a little CPR. 
[01:41:00]  I'm still instruct, and I'm not going to do that.  And what is that call?  Colleen, is there anybody that works there that's willing to do it?  Let me look around.  Are we just going to wait?  We're going to let this lady die?  Apparently.  Well, that's why we're calling 911.  We can't wait.  She can't wait right now.  She is stopping breathing.  All right.  You hear me?  She can't wait for them to get there.  Whoa. 
[01:41:30]  She's taking three breaths.  It's not enough.  You need to get CPR started.  I know.  I don't think so.  He's saying we don't, so you can talk to my boss, and I'm...  Okay.  I don't know.  They're receiving CPR.  Put your fucking boss on the phone.  Look, jerky.  I don't need to talk to you.  By the facility.  Yeah.  When will the fire department be here?  When will the...  They're coming as quick.  They've been on the way all this time, but we can't wait.  This lady's going to die.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:42:00]  Well, then, if you get anybody, any stranger that happens to walk by that's willing to help,  I understand if your boss is telling you you can't do it.  But if there's any...  As a human being, I don't...  You know, is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die?  Um, not at this time.  No, they won't...  They won't...  Oh, my God.  This lady's so fucking hateable.  How fucking hateable.  Fucking cunt.  Oh, boy.  No, not at this time.  Yeah.  This fucking medical shit.  There's absolutely no emotion. 
[01:42:30]  God, she's everything you hate about the medical system.  Could you imagine, though, if this old battle axe that's on the floor was the biggest cunt  to this woman for years?  Yeah, right.  And she's laying in bed and everything.  Get me my bedpan!  And then she throws shit at her and stuff.  So, finally, she's on the floor dying and the woman's just like...  Yeah, I don't think...  Nah.  Nah.  I don't think so.  I guess her name is Colleen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The lack of emotion is just fucking creepy. 
[01:43:00]  She's fucking...  Yeah.  It's like, I literally hope she's killed by a drunk driver.  It fucking brings out rage hearing this.  Yeah.  But, I mean, because she doesn't even explain herself.  Yeah, not at this time.  One good explanation would...  Yeah.  ...would, you know, help out the situation.  What a hunk of garbage.  You know, we're not allowed to do anything because something.  Because...  How could they not be...  I understand the legality of it, but I don't understand how as a person... 
[01:43:30]  You just watched somebody drop dead on the floor.  If it's lawsuits you're worried about.  I can't imagine you wouldn't say fuck all that and just, like, do what's right.  I don't know.  I kind of...  I'm not swinging the same way you guys are.  Why?  I'm just not.  But, explain yourself.  Like, if someone drops in front of you, but if you try to help them, you could be in trouble  down the road, I don't...  It would be tough not to try to help.  I'm not just saying, you know, if this woman was walking down the street with a walker and 
[01:44:00]  she fell down and somebody called 911, of course there's going to be people that will  rush to help her.  She's in this environment where I think the people there know what needs to be done with  at each patient better than the person on the phone.  All right, fair enough, but why isn't she explaining herself then?  You know what?  And she's fully aware of the environment she's in and what could go wrong or what could happen  to her if she does the wrong thing.  Then you've got to explain that.  Look, she's a cunt on wheels.  But...  All right.  But I can't say she did anything wrong. 
[01:44:30]  Except for the fact that she's, you know, she's Nurse Ratched cold.  She's reprehensible.  Kenny texted me, she said, good Samaritan laws, only criminal immunity still can get civil.  Okay.  All right, but...  Tell us again, to fear of being sued.  It's just this fucking fear of lawyers.  Look, if she did everything right in this situation, I don't know, the one thing she didn't  do right was explain what's going on here to the 911 operator.  Do you think if she would have explained it, that 911 operator would have gotten any less...  I don't know, but...  But the coldness of this woman is creepy. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, yeah, believe me.  Yeah, I don't...  Believe me.  That ain't gonna happen.  You know what?  She's...  She sounds annoyed like she was probably ready to go on her lunch break or something and  has to deal with this shit.  She works in an environment where she probably watches these fucking fossils drop on a daily  basis, and it doesn't bother her.  Right.  And she's just, you know, she's like one of the fucking thousand yard stare people in the  NOM.  She don't fucking care.  So she's like, here.  Oh, by the way.  Well, no, we're not gonna do that.  It's a fucking...  She's... 
[01:45:30]  It's a product on the floor.  It's a product.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  We got more info coming in from Lou.  Lou?  Lou in Florida.  Lou.  Lou?  What's up?  Hey, Lou.  What happened, Lou?  Okay.  Tell us about it.  Apparently, the lady is on leave in the hospital.  The nursing home issued a statement saying that that's not their practice, that the way the  lady handled the phone call is not their typical practice, and that's all they're saying right  now, but it was just on Fox News. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the she...  I bet you that this fucking...  I bet you this dog shit cunt of a woman misunderstood something about the policy and her fucking...  I hope I'm wrong.  I literally hope that I'm wrong.  I want to be wrong about this and just go, you know what?  God, am I a reacting asshole?  Because it's too disturbing to realize that there are...  We are...  This is what we've come to.  Yeah.  Like, it's a fucking fear of lawyers. 
[01:46:30]  If it's a DNR, that's totally different.  Like, if the old lady goes...  Fuck the old lady knowing that there's nothing there.  Well, she signed up!  There!  We all get that.  That?  Yeah, she said that, you know.  Because none of us look at ourselves that way.  None of us look at our own shit that way.  Try getting into an accident that insurance isn't going to cover on some technicality.  You're really going to go,  Eh, well, I did sign the paper, so I should shut up.  No.  You're going to be outraged.  Did she fall, this lady? 
[01:47:00]  I don't know.  I'm falling!  Did they at least get her a pillow for her head or something?  They were doing a porn shoot.  She slipped on cum.  Did they make her comfortable that she was dying in front of everybody?  She had a stroke is what happened.  Yeah, they're not saying much else about it.  I think it's just a lack of compassion overall  that someone's in that job just acting like such an asshole.  That woman is...  That's what bothers a lot of us today is the lack of compassion.  She's a pig.  The way she's saying everything to the 911 operator.  Thank you, Lou.  Let's finish the call here. 
[01:47:30]  We're willing to help this lady and not let her die?  Not at this time.  No, they won't touch her at all.  I can't get them touched at all.  We have residents that are hurried and older.  Any guests that are there that are willing to help?  No, I don't have any staff.  Is there a gardener or any staff, anybody that doesn't work for you anywhere?  Can we flag someone down in the street and get them to help this lady?  No.  Can we flag a stranger down?  Can we flag a stranger down? 
[01:48:00]  I bet a stranger will help her.  I'm pretty good at talking them into it.  If you can flag a stranger down, I will help.  I will help tell them how to help her.  I don't know if I'll hold her.  Well, yeah.  Okay.  Well, she said not to move her.  Yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  And her boss said it was okay.  This is not...  I do not feel this is about a DNR. 
[01:48:30]  This is about we don't provide that type of service and I don't want to get in trouble.  That's what this is about.  This is not about a DNR.  Because she would have just said, no, no, do not resuscitate.  We don't do that.  Most of us know at least one person in an old age home or assisted living.  I guess you've got to do your research to see how they're going to handle your mom, your dad, your grandma, your grandpa.  If they drop, I guess it's up to us to see exactly what they would do in this situation. 
[01:49:00]  I guess it all depends on what the place is.  The people, if they do give care, if they sign something that said do not resuscitate, you know.  This woman, obviously, she just sounds like, you know, a piece of shit.  I'm sure she's a joy to be around.  Right.  But I don't know if I'm blaming her much on this one.  She probably...  You know, we do live in a certain world that...  She probably followed protocol.  Oh, jeez.  How ironic. 
[01:49:30]  Valerie Harper has brain cancer.  Ah.  And she always wore those scarves around her head.  Yeah.  I bet that...  Had something to do with it.  So did Lyle Alzado.  Look what happened to her.  Yep.  Brain cancer.  Mm-hmm.  Aw.  Valerie Harper.  Or Rhoda.  That's terrible.  Rhoda has the brain cancer.  Old pudding head.  Oh, God.  It's terrible.  Yeah, yeah.  Rhoda from the Mary Tyler Moore show.  How old is she?  Later on her own show, Rhoda.  Oh.  Let's hear this. 
[01:50:00]  Hi, I'm Rhoda Morgenstern.  I have a softball in my cranium.  Oh, Jesus.  How old is she?  She's 42.  Since I said she was 42.  Not 42.  A young 42.  She is a little older than 42.  73.  73.  Yeah, she was one of those hippie bruds.  Ah.  I'm Rhoda Morgenstern.  I grew up on Venus. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, it's Brooklyn, New York.  Yes.  What do you got there, Jim Norden?  Travis just handed me this.  It says,  The company whose employee refused to administer CPR to a dying woman said the employee wrongly  interpreted its policy.  Whoops-a-daisy.  But the elderly woman's family said she would not have wanted life-prolonging aid.  There you go.  But this woman is still a repulsive cunt.  The family statement of the Associated Press absolves an elder care home of blame came 
[01:51:00]  less than an hour and a half before the company issued a statement saying the employee's  failure to heed a 911 dispatcher's was the result of a misunderstanding of the company's  emergency medic.  Just a fucking corporate, a fucking hateable, just corporate fucking zero who didn't want  to do what the company didn't want.  Yeah, it happens.  The developments were laid as twisted and a controversy.  Okay, blah, blah, blah.  The dispatcher insisted the woman who identified herself as a nurse perform... 
[01:51:30]  Okay, I'm sorry.  The Holmes' parent company, Brookdale Senior Living, said...  Holmes?  This incident resulted from a complete misunderstanding of our practice with regards to emergency medical  care for our residents.  Glenwood Gardens is conducting an investigation.  The company said the employee was on voluntary leave during the process.  Just a fucking...  So she is an absolute, detached, worried-about-company-policy cunt, and her boss is the same thing.  They are fucking hateable people. 
[01:52:00]  That is the world we live in.  The only solace you can take is the fact that the old woman would not have wanted the...  This is one of those things where, thank God, that this fucking pig did this in a case  where the woman wanted no assistance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's enraged.  That would have been, oh boy, the lawsuits that would have happened if...  And Travis, oh, there's more.  The Tennessee-based parent company also said that by law, the independent living facility  is not licensed to provide medical care for any of its residents. 
[01:52:30]  But it later added that it was reviewing company policies involving emergency medical  care across all of our communities.  Just there's more corporate lawyer...  Yeah.  ...talk.  There's not one thing of, hey man, a person needs help, I'm going to help them.  No.  This is not a medical issue, it's a business issue.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is, man.  In those homes, if you have a DNR, you have to wear a bracelet.  Oh.  I think they're being too hard on the nurse.  They deal with this every day.  It's part of their job. 
[01:53:00]  To be that cold?  Yeah, but that's why we hate the medical profession.  You know what?  Make-believe.  Then make-believe.  And then don't get mad...  You can't do a little acting?  Don't get...  I'm sorry.  No, yeah, go ahead.  Don't get mad when a cop smashes your teeth with his nightstick because he's jaded.  You know what I mean?  Nobody looks at it like that.  But if a cop pulls you over and you get smart and he smacks you in the face, you're not  going to go, hey, man, he deals with this every day.  A lot of people are focusing on that she might have just was doing her job, but we're focusing  on the fact that you listen to a person that doesn't have a human emotion.  And that's bothersome. 
[01:53:30]  And her company, believe me, didn't say she's doing her job.  They said she misinterpreted the policy.  Mm-hmm.  If she was doing her job, they would have said, hey, yeah, she was just doing her job.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I want to go to Rob in Cleveland.  A lot of phones coming in, but Rob, go ahead.  What do you want to add to this?  Yeah, I'm a paramedic in the city of Cleveland, and we go to nursing homes all the time.  They're scattered throughout the city.  They're absolutely...  These nurses are absolutely horrible.  Actually, if you go on YouTube, there's all kinds of cartoons that kind of explain it, 
[01:54:00]  but there's three sentences, basically, that we hear every single time.  It's, this isn't my patient.  I just got here five minutes ago.  I don't know what's going on.  What happened?  It was probably 10 minutes ago.  Yeah, they don't want to be bothered, right?  No, not at all.  It's basically...  They kind of scatter like roaches when we get there.  You know, we kind of go up into the room.  We get the call.  It's never for cardiac arrest.  But we go in, and the patient's just sitting there not breathing.  Nobody's doing CPR, and they just scatter.  So then one of us has to go find one of these nurses and say, 
[01:54:30]  Hey, does this patient have a DNR?  What's going on?  When were they last seen?  You know, and they're cold and stiff.  And it's like, it's absolutely horrible in these nursing homes.  And it's a joke throughout the community, throughout the EMS and part of the community,  knowing that these nurses are like this.  I mean, people, you know, it's just absolutely horrible.  I would rather, and all of us that's in this field would rather die before we get to the point  where we have to go into a nursing home because of this.  Because you've seen it.  You've seen what it's really about.  Oh, it's horrible.  They're just not one of them that I've been to in the city, in this area, 
[01:55:00]  is, you know, beyond this measure of how these nurses act.  And it's kind of the joke in the nurses.  The nurses, the nurses that can't handle, like, if they're terrible in nursing school  and they can't handle, you know, being, you know, a nurse on a floor or in an ER,  that's where they go.  They go to the nursing home.  Man.  You know, I'm sure they're not all like this, but it sounds like a lot of them certainly are.  It's a majority.  Yeah.  Thank you, Rob. 
[01:55:30]  Sure, no problem.  All right.  There's some more insight.  Why would you take a job like that, then?  You're that desperate for work, I guess.  It's just enraging.  I can't wait until this cunt's real name comes out.  And it will.  Oh, that's a fucking enraging.  Man.  Well, how come People Magazine already has, like, a cover of Valerie Harper's Brave Goodbye?  They're the ones who broke the story.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  So it's their story, and then the whole issue comes out on Friday, but they put a little tease out. 
[01:56:00]  Jesus.  They're teasing the brain tumor story?  They are fucking vultures.  That's fucking sick.  They're just vultures.  But people will say we're...  Only in people.  Only in people.  Oh, that's great.  They're teasing the brain tumor fucking story.  She has a lump on her fucking brain.  Find out, you know, makes you buy our magazine to hear about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Lovely.  They'll tell you about her brave goodbye.  And I say this loosely, obviously.  How did we become the good guys?  I love loosely.  How did we become the good guys?  Like, everyone has surpassed us in their shitty fucking behavior. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  What?  They're teasing a brain tumor story.  I just got I love loosely.  Thank you.  That was funny.  How did you even hear that?  It took me a little bit.  Hey, wait.  So she says the brave goodbye now.  Is it malignant?  Terminal.  She's got less than three months to live.  Wow.  Oh, no.  Fuck.  She better...  Has terminal brain cancer.  Get on the ball there.  She's not...  She's doing the Gary Carter, huh?  Take care of business.  Wow.  Fuck.  Did they just not know it? 
[01:57:00]  Or has she known it and they could not?  Who knows?  I don't know.  That's terrible.  I haven't talked to her lately.  I haven't known it yet.  She found out on the 15th of January.  Oh, so she was undiagnosed.  And they told you you got three months.  They said you have about three months to live.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I better get checked.  Oh, yeah.  Bless you.  Thank you.  Are you sick now, too?  No, no, no.  That was a...  I got it.  My stupid apartment in the city.  It's so cold.  Jimmy thinks he's got a brain cancer. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Jesus, Jimmy.  How's Annette Funicello doing?  Have you checked in with her lately?  Oh, no.  She's a disaster.  Yeah.  Man.  She finds out January 15th.  I want to know what happened.  I bet she had symptoms for a while.  I'll probably have lost a vision or blurriness or to pick up People Magazine on Friday to  find out.  Yeah.  Get the exclusive.  Yeah, they're not telling you everything.  They're teasing it right now.  God damn. 
[01:58:00]  Brave panel.  That's fucking her brave goodbye.  Like, you know you're dead.  Oh, boy.  She's been around a while.  I got to get my fucking brain checked out.  I keep thinking I have a tumor.  Death can't be that bad if we all do it.  No, it's true.  If everyone dies, then how bad could it really be?  Yeah.  Meh.  Huh?  Who said that?  Bunny.  No, Jimmy's playing this new character.  Why aren't you involved yet, eh?  Oh, I don't know.  Jimmy thinks he might have a brain.  He's looking up at the light. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm talking to a relative.  Oh, boy.  Is this Jim?  It's fast.  Oh, boy.  Well, we're going to break.  We got The Miz coming in a little bit.  Yeah.  And do you say Hugo or Ugo Chavez?  I say Hugo Chavez.  I say good riddance.  I'm going to go Ugo.  I'm not going to pronounce that H.  No?  Nah.  Ugo.  Hey, did you watch the rest of the Journey movie?  No.  I haven't seen it yet.  I was watching things on Liberia and the Congo. 
[01:59:00]  Wow.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  Just a scream of hoot over there.  I like fucking shit beach.  I want to take a vacation on shit beach.  Can we talk about that next?  I don't know what you're talking about.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  It's that documentary from Vice.  Right.  Oh, that Jimmy recommended?  Yeah.  Really good.  You've got to see Karachi.  Karachi.

Someone just tweeted me, um, this thing, it's, uh, it says Black Monopoly, right?  And it's a Monopoly board, but every space is go to jail.  Oh, see?  Oh, wow, that's terrific.  Wow.  You gotta retweet that?  That's hilarious.  I should.  I should. 
[02:01:30]  I might have seen that before, because it's kind of, it's kind of, I'm kind of, ugh,  people.  What?  They're shit.  They're just sharing with you.  Stop sending me shit, you know I've seen a thousand times for fucking five years.  I'm just, they're just trying to help you out a little bit.  Why are you so annoyed?  Because people are dumb.  You don't like when they send the little jokes?  Oh, that and the sexy fucking girl in panties and bra with holding a gun.  Hey, is this your girl?  You don't like that?  Stupid. 
[02:02:00]  So, so they shouldn't send you any of that stuff, right?  Exactly.  What about the barbecue in the shape of a gun?  That one finally died down.  Is this your barbecue?  Anthony, I think I found your house.  And then it's a picture of the mailbox that's shaped like a pistol.  Anthony, is this your...  Fucking...  Ugh.  Because they get me, like it's a link, and it's like, I click on it, and I'm really...  Nothing new.  No surprises.  You can't express interest in anything. 
[02:02:30]  No.  Where people give you everything involved with it.  Everything about it.  Yeah, no one gives a shit.  And then it ruins it.  It ruins it.  I like birds.  Oh, here's a book on birds.  Hey, dude.  And an illustrated book about birds.  Is this your pool?  And there's some girl at the pool, and it's fucking like junior high, and they're holding  guns.  And it is.  It is.  It is.  That's funny.  Too funny.  People.  You hear about the TSA now allowing small pocket knives in airplanes. 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  And that's got people a little nervous.  Why?  I think they took too much time.  Box cutters, they said, but only because they're too emotional for people.  It's too much of a...  But they're allowing small knives and stuff again, because this just doesn't pose a danger.  Tiny little pocket knives.  You're not allowed to have a locking blade on it.  You're not allowed to have a molded handle around a knife.  It can't be a permanently open knife.  It's those things where, do you ever see the little knives that you open up, and it's 
[02:03:30]  got a little Swiss Army knife, like a scissor on it, a file, and a knife.  I don't know how many of those since 9-11 I've had taken away because it's been in my carry-on  or something, or in my pocket, and you take it out.  And then they just take it, and it's useless.  So you're not going to...  Especially people in first class.  Let me explain to you how wonderful it is.  You get metal forks and knives.  It's wonderful.  So they assume the first class people aren't the ones.  Meanwhile, all the fucking hijackers were in first class.  They wanted to be in the other fucking door. 
[02:04:00]  Of course.  So, yeah.  Because you'd want to be less inspicuous.  Inspicuous.  Jesus.  Conspicuous.  Conspicuous.  That, of course, you would fucking go in first class.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they give you glass.  A glass.  Yes, you do.  You could just smash the glass.  I'm going to blame that on the...  Drive it into someone's face.  Yeah.  A lot more damage than a stupid little pocket knife.  Well, you know the next incident.  It's going to be all hell breaking loose.  And those pilots aren't going to open that door for nothing.  No. 
[02:04:30]  No.  So they're just going to hear screaming and yelling and fucking pounding.  Although the terrorists will have like fucking 500 little knife wounds.  Everyone will pull out their little pocket knives and stick them with a fucking...  Little puncture wounds.  Yeah.  With a corkscrew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess Swiss Army knives are allowed right now.  What do they say?  What else are they allowing?  A bunch.  There's a picture of it.  Grenades.  It's amazing.  No, there was something else.  It's hypocrisy.  Yeah.  Bombs.  Knives and bats.  Was it bats?  Billy?  What the fuck was it?  There was another one.  It's one what's mine.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  They're allowing hockey sticks.  Hockey sticks.  Macross sticks.  Two and three quarter.  I didn't know those were banned.  Yeah.  Two and three.  They're afraid Riff is going to get on the plane.  Two and three quarter.  2.35 inches they allow for a knife.  Very small.  Like he says.  For a penis.  Yeah.  Get on.  Exactly.  All their flights to China were canceled.  We still got to awkwardly drink our water in front of the TSA guy.  None of that liquid.  Still no liquid.  Yeah.  Still can't bring cologne or shampoo.  Unless it's under three ounces. 
[02:05:30]  So stupid.  It's terrible.  Surrendous.  And yeah, you can't bring baseball bats like a Louisville Slugger, but you can bring  those souvenir bats that they hand out, the little ones, and wiffle ball bats are  completely allowed.  Wait, novelty bats could do some damage, though.  Really, though?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could fucking hurt someone with a novelty bat.  I just, every time I picture someone getting beaten with a novelty bat, I just get that  Three Stooges sound effect in my head, that...  It doesn't seem very...  Menacing.  We used to collect the novelty bats growing up. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, man, they hurt.  They were great.  Fuck yeah.  Fucking bat day.  They're doing background checks.  That's what they're going to concentrate on more.  Like this pre-screen.  Come up TSA pre-screen for the airports that have it.  It's amazing.  You keep your shoes on, your laptop's in the bag.  What about that?  Yeah, they just gave it to me on American.  I had no idea.  I just went, I was going through the line, like, oh, you're in this line.  Yeah?  They fucking, like, put your ticket over an infrared scanner and boop, you're good.  But randomly, you won't be good.  So you can't just, you know...  A lot of times you have to go through regular security, but it's fucking great. 
[02:06:30]  I don't want to...  I want that.  Leave your shoes on.  You're right through.  That is nice.  That shoe thing.  Unless you really sit back and realize the simple task of taking off your shoes and put  them on, give you the ability to fly across the nation in a matter of hours, instead of  a Conestoga wagon for months, eating your family and friends.  But, boy, does that annoy people.  It's a pain in the ass.  Me included.  I fucking hate the shoe thing.  It's a pain in the ass. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  But, you know, you put it all in perspective.  And then there's...  Louis C.K. said, you know, you're sitting 30,000 feet in the air, flying hundreds of  miles an hour.  But the problem is, there's nowhere to put your shoes back on properly.  That is...  You're kind of leaning up against a wall and...  Yeah.  It's a balancing act.  Everyone looks like a fucking bum.  Yeah.  How about some benches?  How about some more benches so we can put our shoes on properly?  But it works, too.  That hasn't happened again anywhere.  That was kind of creepy.  Don't you always feel and look like you got away with something when they put your shit 
[02:07:30]  through security and you're grabbing it and the guy looks at you like, thank you!  Like, you're like, holy fuck.  Wow, they didn't discover the bomb.  Then you realize you don't have anything.  What is that about?  I don't know.  You do the same thing when you leave a store.  Without buying anything.  I do the same thing.  You feel fucking guilty as shit.  I always feel like I have to stop before the exit to look at something.  Right.  Like, oh, postcards.  You know, I'm suspicious.  Just so it's like, well, if he was stealing something, he obviously wouldn't stop.  Right.  So I feel like a fucking tool.  We all do that, though. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I know we all do that.  We don't want to look guilty.  What's all that guilt about?  I don't know.  I've had it.  I'm stopping doing it.  Why can't we just walk out of a store?  Yeah.  I didn't buy anything.  I'm walking the fuck out of here.  Guilt free.  Guilt free.  I'll walk out and actually announce, I'm not stealing anything.  Yeah, it's a weird thing.  You're afraid of being stopped.  I don't know why.  It's so stupid.  Yeah.  I have nothing.  I mean, come on.  We're white.  My stupid gag, and I do do this, and I'll throw myself under the bus.  Every time that it goes off, I scream, run. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, that is good.  Every time.  And then the guy will look, oh, that's funny, but I still got to check your bag.  I've only been checking it once like that.  It goes off all the time.  Yeah.  Because I steal.  Because you're a thief.  I used to love good stealing every once in a while.  Yeah, the day.  Back in the day, I used to love a little.  Oh, it's fucking great.  I would go to stationary stores with your friends, and that was like you're cutting your thievery teeth. 
[02:09:00]  Candy, magazines, things like that.  Playboy magazines for us.  And that adrenaline rush.  Yeah, baseball cards.  Those were tough.  They were right in front.  They were right at the counter.  But the Playboy magazines were really easy.  Sorry to interrupt your story, but I'm in on this one.  I'm right with you on this one.  The Playboy magazines, they always put it in the back corner or something because they were embarrassed to have it in the store,  which was perfect for stealing.  And they didn't have cameras back then.  No.  They didn't even have the fucking mirrors up yet.  Nothing.  Nothing.  It was the guy's eyes, and he would look around like... 
[02:09:30]  Yep.  Because I've seen some of my friends get caught, man.  I never got caught.  I was pretty good with not putting too much candy in the pocket so you're not walking out looking like you've got a fucking elephant.  Now, we called it the Sprint for Freedom.  I would always wait for the guy to make his rounds in the stationery store in Centerport.  Yeah, yeah.  Near the Centerport stores.  He would always make his rounds eventually just because he was bored to be sitting behind the counter.  Right, yeah.  And I would be ready to go, man.  And as soon as he left his spot, which is meaning he's moving away from the door... 
[02:10:00]  It's conspicuous.  We would call it the Sprint for Freedom.  Really?  I don't know.  And then we wouldn't go back in that store for a while.  I'd use Covert.  Because we were convinced he knew.  I'd use Covert more.  Oh, you went Covert.  We went Sprint for fucking Freedom.  Walk around fucking...  Yeah, okay.  This is cool.  Oh, yeah.  I don't have anything in my pockets.  And then leave.  It was so good.  No candy tasted better than stolen candy, right?  That's right.  Fucking hit the woods up, go to the hideout, and just start eating your bounty of goods 
[02:10:30]  that you...  You did the steaks, right?  That was a big fraternity thing because we were all poor.  What?  That's stealing steaks.  Oh, I never did that.  No, no.  Oh, man.  We would up the ante when we got older.  Stealing meat is just a different level.  It really is.  Why?  I don't know.  It was better than eating fucking...  Man.  I don't have a lot of crisps for this.  Yeah, of course.  It was better than the Chef Boyardee and all that really...  Like mac and cheese and all that.  We wanted to eat for real.  This is something really hungry about stealing meat.  Yeah, but we didn't have the money to get a nice steak.  From a supermarket, yeah. 
[02:11:00]  We had money for our beer and drugs, of course, but...  How'd you get through the checkout?  This is years ago.  I don't even know.  You just walked through?  Yeah.  Or did you go past the customer service thing where there's no checkout person?  Oh, that's smart.  Well, the other way where now you're stuck at the exit door instead of the entrance one?  No, we would have...  One guy would be buying, you know, groceries.  Legit.  And then you would have some, you know, some extras.  That's how we got away with it.  Would you shove it in your shirt or something? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Where do you hide a London broil?  Right in your jeans, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Pull that shit out.  It was marinated nice.  That's pretty fucking...  Picking pubes off of it.  Yee.  Honestly, that's a memory that goes so far back.  I don't know exactly how he pulled it off anymore.  I'm trying to remember.  Everyone stole back then.  It's just what you did.  Sam, don't fall into that as a young kid.  Young kid.  Fucking 35 now.  He stole pubic hair and put it on his head. 
[02:12:00]  Stealing was kind of fun.  It was just too much tension, though.  It was too nerve-wracking.  It was nerve-wracking.  It was an anxiety attack.  For sure.  But then when you checked out your loot...  That was the good shit, too.  Like when you stole from a can store.  There was some stealing that was just for the sake of stealing.  Like going into a hardware store and stealing a bolt.  Oh, really?  What the fuck am I doing?  Why am I doing this?  I think the worst we ever did was steak here and there.  I never went for the big ticket items.  The big ticket toys. 
[02:12:30]  Jewelry or clothes or any of that shit.  I never went down that road.  I got caught so many times stealing comic books.  And then you have to go in that back office.  You weren't that bad?  I was a terrible thief.  Really?  I was greedy.  I'd always come back and try to steal more.  Yeah, we'd get busted.  Me and my friend Paul got caught stealing comic books in this place that we used to always go to, the flea market.  And the guy liked us.  Yeah.  It was like when Rerun got busted.  The guy was like, come on.  You guys were like, I liked you guys.  Oh, really?  And he took back some of the, instead of calling our parents, he took back some of the comics that we had actually bought, too. 
[02:13:00]  You should have told him the story of the scorpion and the frog.  I don't know that story.  It's a story about a scorpion who wants to get across the river.  And he wants to go on the frog's back and fucking, you know, hitch a ride with the frog.  And the frog's like, fuck you, you're a scorpion.  You're going to kill me.  And the scorpion just tells the frog, look, I'm not going to kill you.  You're doing me a favor.  And this argument just goes on and on and on.  And so finally the frog gives in and goes, okay, get on my back.  We'll go across.  And the frog's swimming across. 
[02:13:30]  And they get in the middle.  And the scorpion fucking hits the goddamn frog with his stinger.  And the frog's dying.  He goes, what the fuck are you doing?  Why'd you do that?  He goes, because I'm a scorpion.  Right?  Enough said.  Yeah.  And then they both said, why are we talking?  Because I'm a frog and we're not supposed to do that.  I should have hopped away.  Exactly.  But that's, you know, you're a thief.  That's not worse.  We got busted.  You're a thieving little kid.  Yeah.  I got caught.  Those back rooms were scary.  They're terrible.  They were threatening.  I remember in Greenlawn. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, boy.  What the?  What the?  Yeah, the old supermarket in Greenlawn.  I think it's now a drugstore for the people that want to go local with me.  And we got pulled into the back room.  And they never called our parents.  But it was the threat they were going to call our parents.  So then I remember a few nights going by where you're just wondering, you know, when that phone rang, if it was the fucking supermarket.  Oh, was that scary?  But you know what?  We never stole again from that place.  Yeah.  Not that our stealing was that regular. 
[02:14:30]  But it was that innocent stealing.  I think so.  There's the innocence.  The thievery.  Stealing dirty magazines.  I used to go to a machine and jimmied them out with a fucking screwdriver.  We magazine.  Of course, you jimmy did it out.  Wait, how did you jimmy the machine back then?  It was just a magazine machine.  You just put the screwdriver under it.  And there would always be a magazine ready to be pulled out.  And you just get the screwdriver under it.  And just fucking jimmy.  Now you're using tools.  Wow.  Now you're using thieving tools.  That's worse than just innocent thievery.  That's how long I've been a sex addict. 
[02:15:00]  That's what I would do.  You figured that out, though.  Yeah.  We figured out the soda thing.  And I was the one with the thinnest arm.  So I was the one that got all the free sodas.  Yeah.  Do you remember that, Keg?  Sticking your arm all the way up.  All the way up.  It was creepy as hell.  Yeah.  Because you were jammed up in there up to your elbow.  It's like German porn.  And I remember the first time doing it.  I was wondering if I was going to be electrocuted.  It was an older kid who used to be thin-arm guy passing on the talent at Harvard Fields High School.  And I was the guy because my arm was so thin.  He'd look at everybody's arm. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to pass it on me and my friend.  And then I remember, like it was yesterday, he goes, okay, get your arm up there.  And then he would explain, you feel those wires, okay, you want to move a little to the right or whatever.  I'm making it up now because I don't remember anymore.  And then he's like, okay, you got the buttons.  Each button is a different soda.  So not only were we stealing sodas, I could take requests.  And I would sit at the soda machine after basketball practice for a good ten minutes every other day just getting everyone free sodas because we could. 
[02:16:00]  And you would push the individual buttons depending on what they wanted.  I want to party with you.  But that's a hell of a talent to have in high school.  It's amazing to have gone from that place in life.  Thank God you straightened out.  I could have been prison.  But, I mean, in high school being the guy that people knew you were the guy that could do that.  That is a good talent.  And I never got caught for that one.  Nope.  Not once.  Can you look up what year Pia Zadora was on the cover of We Magazine?  Oh, wow.  Because that was one I remember stealing. 
[02:16:30]  She had those bud nipples.  Slow fade pink nipples.  I'm going to say 82.  I'm going to guess 82 as well.  That's the 82.  Jet pink buds.  She had a hell of a body.  And I told you I have a calendar.  One of the stolen We Magazines.  Yeah.  And it had Howard Stern was in the calendar.  And Ozzy after the bat bite.  It was really weird.  I think Howard was like fucking had a mustache back then.  I just found it.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Wait, is that it?  It looks like June.  It's just not even that.  Look at her body.  It's not that great.  Now that you look back.  I guess that's the one.  82.  Yeah.  June 82. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  We know our shit.  I remember stealing that one.  Fuck.  Can I see the nudies from that magazine?  We was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see Pia Zadora's nudie pics from that.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Do the one on the right.  I want to see.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me see that.  I don't think the body's not that good.  Well, she has kind of a flat ass.  Something weird going on there.  It's out of proportion, man.  Yeah.  Her ass is terrible.  She has like a tiny back and a big butt.  Her crack starts way too down on her ass, I think. 
[02:17:30]  She has a little boy ass.  It's terrible.  Wow.  I remember that being way hotter.  All right.  Find another one.  Maybe we're wrong.  Yeah.  Maybe we're wrong.  Oh, my God.  It's horrendous.  God, I remember these magazine covers.  Find another Pia ass.  Maybe we're fucking...  You can't just go on one.  No.  Oh, there's that one with her in the bathtub all the time.  Jesus.  I remember that.  Let me see her ass.  Yeah, let's see.  Pia Zadora's ass.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  That's actually juicy.  That...  I don't know.  That's not bad.  That's black and white. 
[02:18:00]  Get a color picture of her ass.  That thong is fucking getting gobbled up.  I remember that one.  It was all about her face and her lips.  Her body is horrendous.  Look at that.  There's something weird going on there, right?  She's got flat feet.  Yeah, wow.  Her feet are flat.  What did she do?  Was she an actor?  What was she doing?  She was an actress.  She was on some of these books.  A singer.  I think.  Yeah.  Let me see...  Where's more ass pics?  Don't they have any?  No?  No, of course not.  Of course she was constantly showing her ass.  Show her nipples.  She had nice big, slow-fade nips. 
[02:18:30]  Fucking love it.  I bet you they're going to be horrible.  Yeah, I bet you those aren't even good anymore.  We sure look through gold-colored lenses, don't we?  Gold?  What?  Rose?  Rose-colored lenses, of course.  What am I talking about?  Let's see.  Is she a nice tits?  Not so much.  This is great.  We're destroying our boyhood memories.  I know.  She looks like Sean Cassidy.  How do I want to fuck her?  I remember her...  Not so much, man.  I remember her being the perfect girl back then. 
[02:19:00]  Find a good pic.  Oh, what's that totally naked one right up top?  Over.  Over.  Over.  Right there.  I don't think that's real.  No, it's definitely a horrible photo shop.  That's terrible.  She didn't shave her pussy.  No, it was a different time, Jimmy.  It was a different day.  Don't fucking judge.  No, it's not.  What would you have done if...  You were sexually active during the time before shaving, right, Jim?  Yeah.  And you...  Because you hate pubic hair.  What did you do?  I just licked it.  But did you go like, this would be so much... 
[02:19:30]  Would you like an innovator?  This would be so much better with no hair.  No.  I just licked it and was happy to be fucking allowed to lick it.  Yeah.  No, I didn't really start caring until I got older and started to dig big lips and shit.  Yeah.  Then I started to really care.  There was a transitional period where it was creepy when you saw one bald.  Well, because they went...  Remember?  They went from full-fledged bush...  Right.  ...to the landing strip.  Right.  And then the Hitler mustache.  Right.  Which always looked weird.  And then just totally shaved. 
[02:20:00]  The landing strip, depending on the angle of the girl, always looked like a lonely  place.  It was just kind of sitting there.  Way, way out there.  Like an island you could kind of see.  Yeah.  Like Tom Hanks' island in fucking...  Yes.  Yeah.  It was just this little tuft.  Nothing worse than a tuft.  It looked great when their legs were together and they were standing up.  Right.  It was very...  But then if the legs spread apart and they're on their back...  Right.  It's kind of weird.  It's just, all right, all the gear...  You're looking up over the top and it's like, there's an island way out there.  Tuft.  I don't want a tuft. 
[02:20:30]  It just looks silly.  It kind of looks silly.  Yeah.  Hang on.  It was like...  Yeah, I didn't like that at all.  But then the clean shave...  The only girls that clean shaved back then were...  Were the freaks.  It was sluts.  Yeah, the freakies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it went mainstream.  Porn stars, pretty much, started it.  Yeah.  If you...  I think if I was a kid and, you know, sexually active in my teens and stuff, and a girl I  was with took her panties off and had no hair there, I'd have freaked out. 
[02:21:00]  Of course.  I'd have freaked the fuck out.  Of course.  Like, what is this girl into?  It was weird.  Because you just got out of the age where that was what everybody had was nothing.  So you wanted to see hair back then.  But I remember licking a pussy.  One of the first times I licked an adult hairy pussy and it just smelled...  Oh, horrendous.  But I didn't like it.  I was like...  It was a fucking rotten, matted...  But I always kind of hated hair on it.  I just couldn't stand...  Like, I didn't mind the hair at all.  But then it would get in your throat and you felt like you didn't clean out the artichoke  heart good enough of that stuff.  Just horrible. 
[02:21:30]  The smell.  What?  Yeah, man.  Nah, that's wonderful.  It was tough to keep it all clean.  The hair.  The matty, sweaty hair.  Come on.  You used some Pert shampoo and conditioner in one back then?  How about Prel?  I got a dumb beard right now and I have to keep it clean because I can smell it.  Ew.  What?  And that's like...  What are you doing?  Does that smell your beard?  Yeah, it's horrendous.  What's in it?  I don't know.  Like food from the day, I guess.  Whatever.  And morning breath in the pillow.  All that shit.  Try drool.  But it reminds me of the back in the day... 
[02:22:00]  Women aren't eating and drooling out of their pussies, though.  It's...  Yeah, but...  Not all of them, anyway.  They're sweating down there and all sorts of juices are...  Oh, it's wonderful.  I love a good, subtle female aroma.  I do, too.  Aroma.  I like it more than that.  No deodorant.  I want it to stink.  I really do.  I like that if I like somebody.  Can you Google...  They would get period blood on their...  Jesus Christ.  Really?  Google Wee Magazine covers. 
[02:22:30]  They have good hygiene.  From 82.  I want to see what other covers are that year.  We did this once.  Do we look at the old covers?  Yeah, until we...  We want to know...  I remember this bit.  Iraq, did we do this?  We want to know what year...  Yes, and stealing from a stationery store.  Oh, well, I know that.  No, I know I did that story before.  Yeah.  Calm down, Iraq.  Only point it out when we ask.  I remember we did a bit where we looked at old...  Centerfolds, I think it was.  Yeah.  Centerfolds, and we tried to figure out what year they finally went.  Linda Blair. 
[02:23:00]  I remember so many of these.  That Motley Crue thing for fucking Livewire, I remember that.  I go back a little further than the Motley Crue covers.  Yeah, so do I, but I just remember this is when I was stealing them.  Wee was great, too.  Oh, yeah.  Child of the 80s.  Go Playboy Centerfolds.  Wee and Swank were good.  Yeah, Hustler was always good.  What was that other one?  Cherry.  There was one with a longer name.  High Society.  High Society.  Thank you, yes.  High Society was pretty good.  Yeah.  Playboy Centerfolds.  From 82?  Go, like, start with 80. 
[02:23:30]  What the hell?  Playboy stunk.  Yeah, it was terrible.  It was good in a pinch, but...  But we're looking at the hairstyles.  I can never jerk off the Playboy.  Through the years.  Through the years.  But we want to go...  Or Playmates.  Playmate of the years.  Do you know what I mean?  So I wanted to get, like, a whole...  We did this.  I'm trying to remember what website we did it from.  How about you put nude?  They were attractive, buddy.  There you go.  There was nothing sexy about Playboy.  Um, no, I found a very...  Look at that.  There you go. 
[02:24:00]  That's...  Whoa.  What year is that?  Tan lines.  Big, like, stark white pale tits and panty line area.  I like that.  And a big, not...  Uh, hair, uh...  Nice natural breasts, though.  No implants.  Who's Lisa Welch?  That's the girl.  She's not an actress, right?  She's in porn.  A lot going on downstairs, though.  Holy shit.  So, heir to the jelly fortune.  All right.  What year is this?  All right.  All right.  That's good.  She's kind of doing a, um, Buffalo Bill pose there. 
[02:24:30]  Is that one of the Hermingways in the middle with the headband?  Hermingways?  Hemingways.  Uh-huh.  I was going to say Margot or Mariel Hemingway.  That's, uh, Mariel Hemingway.  She would...  Did she kill herself?  No, Margot didn't.  I think Margot.  A lot of the Hemingways killed themselves.  Oh, there you go.  That's a good fucking picture right there of some...  All right.  Now they're starting to trim down from the belly, at least.  Getting...  You didn't like the hair that ran from the belly button down to the...  They're shaving downwards now a little bit.  The pubis.  The pubis.  Still a lot of hair.  What year is that?  Still 80?  80. 
[02:25:00]  Can we go to another year?  Uh, wow.  That's a lot of hair.  That's a pelt.  She's ample, though.  That's a lot of woman right there.  I don't think a girl could grow it like that anymore.  That's a big square of hair.  That's a rectangle.  It looks like she put a slice of burnt toast in her lap.  That is crazy.  Holy shit.  Holy fucker.  Oh, we're jumping 85.  85.  Let's see what they were doing in 85. 
[02:25:30]  I'm still seeing a lot of...  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What?  That doesn't look like...  Oh.  That's shaved.  That's 85.  That's just hair in the...  But that's not 85.  Yeah.  85.  Well, that looks like 80s.  She's got the 80s hair on her head.  Yeah.  And she's got some...  People were shaving in the 80s like that.  No, they're moving down.  What a terrible, unsexy picture that is.  You don't like that one?  No.  Who could jerk off that?  I mean, if you look at her and go, wow, what a great body.  Oh, my God.  Fucking make that bigger. 
[02:26:00]  This is a transitional phase, the 80s.  Oh, my God.  What is going on with this woman?  Wow, she's covered in sand.  Yeah.  And that hair...  Oh, my God.  That head is too tiny for her giant body.  Looks like she's doing something weird with her shoulders.  Looks like a toupee.  She looks like the fucking monster that gave Bugs Bunny the haircut with that fucking...  Yes.  ...shoulders.  Big shoulders.  Look at that.  It does look like a toupee.  And those are implants.  They didn't have the implants figured out yet.  Yeah, she looks terrible.  Wow.  Stretchy even.  Wow, my God. 
[02:26:30]  You know what, though?  Seeing hair back then, when you're first...  ...started, like, thumbing through it, that was part of it.  Yeah.  That was just as good as just seeing fucking, you know, shaved.  Back then, hair was like, oh, my God, I'm seeing something.  Yes.  It was good.  It was like a little fucking beacon.  I'm going to guess Hustler started with it or one of those, because they showed lips.  Playboy wouldn't show lips or clits.  Fucking red hair is crazy.  That was, like, insane as a kid.  You're like, what is that?  I don't even know.  Wow.  It's red hair.  But look at that. 
[02:27:00]  Penthouse was always so much better.  Playboy stinks.  Oh, yeah.  Penthouse showed a little more.  They showed a little pink.  Yeah.  At least they showed sexy scenarios and lesbians.  That Barbie Benton, though, in Playboy, that was my fucking weakness right there.  It was Barbie Benton, Playboy.  Oh, did I fucking...  Did I learn a thing or two about what to do to Barbie Benton?  Get her nude.  Yes, nude.  You got to put the word nude in, Sam.  What's wrong with you?  Yes, shit. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Fuck.  What year is that?  Like, 75?  Older?  I don't know.  What year is that?  Fuck, that goes back a little ways.  Oh, man.  What a...  What year is that, Sam?  It's 1972.  That just looks old.  Look, I wasn't getting them off the fucking rack.  I had to find them in basements.  That's right, Sam.  I was trolling around.  These were finely aged Playboys that I was using.  Were you jerking off in 1972?  Yes, you were.  What? 
[02:28:00]  No, no.  I don't think I was.  No, no, no, no.  He was driving.  No.  I was driving.  Fucking Jimmy.  Our Playboys...  Our Playboys always smell like they survived the flood.  Yeah.  There's always water damage.  Oh, look at that.  She's just walking the fucking...  What is that?  A monkey?  Yeah, I'm sure it's probably on the Playboy...  Jesus Christ.  Oh, man, why would she be walking monkeys?  Look at her fucking...  You like that?  Her fucking square body?  Her visual square body?  That's kind of a terrible shot.  That's terrible. 
[02:28:30]  She's hunched over a little bit.  Look at that.  There you go, Jimmy.  She's a Bucsotic.  There you go.  They put their curves in.  You have to blow her off 30 years ago, at least, at this point.  She...  Did you fucked her?  Yeah, they were an item for a while.  The bangs.  She liked the bangs.  She was one of the few girls that he actually went with.  Girl.  A beautiful girl.  Longer than, you know, just having a quick thing.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucking good.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  There it is.  Hey.  Erotic black and white photography.  That's...  She was a pretty one.  Oh, my God.  She's laying down with a baboon.  That was stupid.  That's a dumb picture.  She's with a fucking...  She's laying down naked on a lawn.  A finely manicured lawn with a fucking monkey in her face.  It's like she's ready to kiss it.  That's a horrendous ass shot.  Terrible.  You don't like that?  No, it looks horrible.  Fucking brutal. 
[02:29:30]  1972.  Who was Barbie Benton?  She was just...  I think she was just a playmate.  Oh, she wasn't an actress?  And then she ended up on, like, you know, a couple episodes of The Love Boat.  Oh, Jesus.  When is that taken?  Who's that?  That's Barbie Benton.  That's Barbie Benton.  Recently.  She doesn't look bad.  She doesn't look bad.  Nah, she could look a lot worse.  I've seen that.  She doesn't look bad.  I'm sure with her clothes off, you know, you want to fucking...  She's got to be pushing 60 at this point.  One of those uterine slings to keep everything inside these days.  She's vaginal mesh. 
[02:30:00]  Vaginal mesh.  Nothing worse than ripping your tongue on a vaginal mesh.  Oh, shit.  You know you're probably out of your league.  She's got horrible implants.  Yeah, those are definitely bigger than they used to be.  That's 41 years ago she was in Playboy.  She looks pretty fucking good, man.  You know what?  She doesn't look good, but she could look a lot worse.  I've seen some of them that look like fucking roadkill.  Yeah.  I think she looks good for that.  She probably does all right out on the circuit.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Big giant tits.  Something big oval implants.  She kind of looks manly, too.  Yeah, she kind of does.  Oh, my God.  Old men look like women, and old women look like men.  It's a fucking joke.  We switch sexes.  It gets played on us.  It's what happens.  It's a little strange.  That estrogen and testosterone does the old switcheroo.  Everybody ends up looking stupid.  Hey, caramba.  Why don't we break?  Yeah, what time is The Miz here?  The Miz is going to be in here in a little bit here. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  About 15 minutes, I think.  Mm-hmm.  And we'll talk about some other stuff.  I have to plug the Comedy Zone in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The Comedy Zone.  This weekend, Toledo, Funny Bone next weekend, and Syracuse the following weekend, and then  Caroline's April 11th through 14th.  I'm sure those will be big sellers.  They are.  They're big sellers, right?  Come on, Jimmy.  They certainly will be.  Can I get a cup of coffee? 
[02:31:30]  Sure.  You want it from here or Starbucks?  Oh, from here.  Please, Kenny.  All right.  When is your car coming back?  Kenny, here's my ticky.  You leaving now?  I'll be retreating to the compound this evening.  When do you get to return your clown car and get your big truck back?  I was promised Friday, but I'm going to be in Charlotte, North Carolina with James Norton,  so I'll get it Monday.  What about the snow? 
[02:32:00]  Going to get out of town?  Going to be able to get out of here?  God willing.  And the river don't rise.  Yes.  Yeah.  When's the snow coming?  Today?  Later on today, a wintry mix of wet snow and rain in our area.  Areas to the west and north will see a more significant snowfall.  What about Sunday?  Sunday, it should be clearing up.  Slightly breezy with cooler temperatures.  Really?  Yeah.  That sucks.  Big St. Paddy's Day parade.  Chad! 
[02:32:30]  Chad!  Now, Chad.  Chad!  Oh, what a douche.  If you let me talk.  What's her name?  Carol?  Carol.  Women and Carol are always cunts.  She's one of the name of your aunt.  I hope her name's not Carol.  I hope not, too.  That's terrible.  It might be Carol.  She's not happy over there.  All right, we'll...  Blustery with a chance of snow.  Yeah.  Yes.  No.  Never.

This is Troy, phone screener for The Opie and Anthony Show, here to help you with a helpful tip. 
[02:34:30]  When calling into the radio show, it's a good idea that you turn your radio down.  O&A, what's your name?  Where are you calling from?  Yeah, make sure Opie knows that we don't know shit from shit.  Turn your radio down!  What?  I can't hear you.  Am I on the air?  Hey, asshole!  Am I live right now?  Hey, turn your radio down!  Hey, you!  Turn your radio down!  All right, thanks, man.  Punch it out.  See?  Wasn't that easy.  It gets you on the air faster and it makes you a better caller.  Oh, and if you want to call the show, just look down at your radio.  Yeah, right there.  Take your eyes off the road and look down. 
[02:35:00]  See the number?  Just call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Thank you, and have a nice day.  Three of the action.  Three of the action.  The Opie Reads of the show.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  We're back.  Did you guys do the airborne, um, the airball shot? 
[02:35:30]  Mmm.  Oh, no.  Oh, that was hilarious.  You guys didn't play that?  The one from The Weeknd?  No, not the most amazing, um, buzzer beater ever.  You guys saw that play, right?  The one from my high school?  Was it your actual high school?  The Rochelle High School.  I saw, yeah.  You saw that, right?  I did, yeah.  The most amazing buzzer beater ever?  I certainly did.  That's kind of old news now, but.  Yeah, yeah.  Guy heaved the ball, the dummy, first of all, through the ball. 
[02:36:00]  That's been done a million times.  Yeah.  You can't just throw it in the air, knowing that it's going to run out the clock.  Yeah, but that's pretty stupid.  Why not just fucking bang it on the floor a few times, and then give it the old heave-ho  then?  He gave him too much time to.  Certainly, in hindsight, it looked, it was a dumb idea, but.  Well, in hindsight, lighting the match was a bad idea.  But, remember that one?  Right.  With that said, this is, this is, this is a miracle.  This is a, this is unbelievable.  I can't see it. 
[02:36:30]  You didn't see it?  Why?  Because I can't see that.  Oh.  Thank you.  Yeah, this is old news, though.  I mean, I was just referencing it.  We don't have to see it again.  But the guy has the ball, just tosses it up.  That guy grabs and heaves it, and swish.  Get the fuck.  You see how fast the refs got out of there?  Yeah.  Oh, man, they were petrified.  Right.  That's Noricheldo.  That's Westchester.  It's the type of shit that goes down every day.  Oh, shut up.  Luck.  Luck.  Total luck.  It's a lucky county.  Lucky city. 
[02:37:00]  But the air ball one was hilarious.  The Wizards game.  Oh, yeah, it didn't go, it didn't actually go, and they thought it did.  The call was like, there it is.  We haven't played this yet on our show?  Hit the side of the fucking net, and it looked like it went through the hoop.  Beal driving.  Kicks it out.  Ariza, baseline.  Dagger!  Wow.  Dagger!  Ariza from the baseline for three, and the Wizards with a miraculous comeback in Washington. 
[02:37:30]  They'll pro...  They're saying it did not go.  Oh, wait a minute, he missed.  We saw the nets move.  We saw what appeared to be the ball go through the net, but evidently it came up short.  It was an air ball in the bottom of the net.  Yeah, it went on the net, but it didn't go through the basket. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, you just referenced my favorite one, where the guy is talking to himself.  What?  What?  It didn't go?  Do we have that, Iraq?  I know, you've got to kind of pull that one out of your ass, but he starts talking.  That is gone!  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What?  They're saying you're the one who said it.  You said it.  The announcers at the Wizards game continued here.  Well, from our angle, it looked like it dropped straight through, but clearly...  I was wondering why we didn't see more reaction from the Wizards players, and we seem to see 
[02:38:30]  a sigh of relief coming from the Pistons.  So the dagger has been retracted.  First time caught up, I believe.  Wow.  Hmm.  Eh?  Oops.  Eh?  Oops.  That's the big sports news.  Ah, it's a little old now, I guess, but I just love when the announcers mess up.  I'm trying to find that baseball one. 
[02:39:00]  That one's really good.  Yeah, that was a good one.  We used to have a disc filled with all the mistakes.  E-Rock?  What was his name again?  He was the Mets announcer, right?  Yeah.  Oh, that was...  Kiner?  Ralph Kiner?  Who was the other guy?  Bob Murphy.  Bob Murphy.  Bob Murphy.  Kiner's corner.  I don't know if it was those guys.  What do you got?  I got a lot.  Just play one.  I don't care.  We're wasting time.  We're in between, like, getting into something, because we've got the Miz coming in any minute.  Let's see if this is it.  The pitch. 
[02:39:30]  High five-one.  It's the left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Egg by Yaddy.  Egg's going to play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I was unsure he was unable to reach it.  It's caught by Egg by Yaddy.  I apologize.  He was way out there, and it didn't look like he had a play on it.  But he caught it against the wall in left center field.  Egg by Yaddy.  Oh, God.  Remember that?  That's not the best one, but still good.  What else you got? 
[02:40:00]  I'm looking through all my...  Oh, okay.  I thought you had them.  Found a bunch of them.  Mm-hmm.  Egg by Yaddy.  You guys excited for baseball?  Why?  World Series coming up?  Well, you're the Yankees fan.  I'm excited to go to some games.  I do enjoy my time at this stadium.  I like going to Phillies games way more than Mets games.  Matter of fact, I still have not been to the new stadium out there.  Yeah, I've been to shitty field?  Haven't been to city field yet.  I've been to the new Yankee Stadium. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Or Yankee Stadium.  And I've been to the Phillies.  I've been to more Phillies games in the last five years than Mets games.  I would assume, definitely.  It's good down there.  It's fun.  Yeah.  I just like going to the games when it's a nice day and hang out, drink some beers.  Right.  But as far as really getting psyched for the actual gameplay and how the teams are doing,  yeah, I'm a fan of the Yankees, but I'm not sitting there writing down the stats from day one. 
[02:41:00]  Well, now they've got so much stuff going on, you barely watch the game anymore.  Yeah.  I remember going to Yankee Stadium, and they're like, hey, you want to check out the Yankees Hall of Fame?  And it was around game time.  I'm like, yeah, fuck, let's do that real fast, and then we'll take our seats.  And they're like, oh, it's an hour wait.  So people are waiting an hour during a game to get into the Hall of Fame part.  Can they see the game while they're waiting or not?  No, I don't think so.  There's TVs pretty much everywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah, but at that point, you should stay home and watch it on TV.  You're spending good money to go there.  I want to go to the new stadium once. 
[02:41:30]  It's nice, man.  It's great.  You do it up right in the Legends seats, and then you eat in the restaurant area, and  then you go out in the nice seats.  I'm just going to text our connection and just say hi.  Oh, we have a Yankee.  That's right.  I've never used connections.  I should.  Oh, this is a good one.  Oh, the connection is so good.  This one got me in a Pearl Jam in Philly.  I mean, this is a big connection to have.  I'll just say hi. 
[02:42:00]  Will it be suspicious?  It probably will.  Unlike that move, like I was doing, which is keeping in constant contact throughout  the winter months, I was occasionally being like, hey, how you doing?  You're trying to say it's a little too late to start texting as the weather's hinting  that springs in the air?  It's just fucking, yeah.  You text on opening day.  Hi.  How you been?  I should have sent a text around December 8th.  Merry Christmas.  Something like that.  I don't remember what the last thing was. 
[02:42:30]  Weren't you complaining about tickets last time?  Oh, boy.  I was pissed at my Philly thing.  Oh, yeah.  I wanted better seats for the Pearl Jam show.  So you don't talk to the connection when there's not something going on?  And the last time there was, it was complaining.  Well, I'm punishing her for the bad seats at the Pearl Jam show, and I assume she'll do  the right thing now.  She's such a nice woman.  She's terrific.  Great.  She doesn't deserve to be punished.  She sent baby gifts.  She's a wonderful lady.  Or she said she was sending baby gifts, and I never got them.  She's full of shit.  What?  Oh, my God. 
[02:43:00]  How do you say that?  Look, I, first of all, am out of this conversation because she's wonderful.  Isn't she a great woman?  She's funny.  Yeah.  Very, very kind.  Has she got new seats?  Let me think.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I think she's...  Of course.  Oh, my God.  Great seats.  Legend seats.  And great.  I walk in.  There's a line of people waiting on a table.  It's a fucking restaurant in there.  A line of people waiting to get on there. 
[02:43:30]  She walks me past the entire line.  Sits me at a table.  And, you know, you get your grub, your beers, whatever.  Oh, nice.  It's so nice.  Can I...  Giuliani.  Look.  Oh, Rudy Giuliani's right over there.  Oh, he's checking out.  He's going to be checking out the game.  I did.  I walked past him.  I'm like, how you doing?  What did he say to you?  How you doing?  He's like...  He's not a very friendly guy.  Oh, he had a big bodyguard with him, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can I share with you?  She's in my phone as...  Uh-oh.  I don't know if I should say this. 
[02:44:00]  I mean, if you're going to share, you're going to share.  Put it this way.  Right after you say this, your seats are way up higher.  Right now, here's your seats.  But I can't help myself.  I have to tell you.  She's in my phone as free tickets.  Those seats are gone!  She's in my phone as free tickets.  Free tickets.  Hey, free.  And, all right.  Ready?  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Free tickets?  That's so mean.  Mine.  It's so dehumanizing.  Yeah.  All right, the last time I texted her...  Yeah?  ...was for baby gifts. 
[02:44:30]  It was for baby gifts?  Like, you're texting her saying, I'd like some baby gifts?  No, no, no.  Some babies?  It was a gift?  It's terrible.  She sent baby gifts when my daughter was born, and I wrote,  Hey, thanks so much for the gifts.  That was so nice.  That was November 7th.  Oh, shit!  And today is March 6th.  I know that, because I just wrote and said,  Hey, how you doing?  Wow.  You said thank you for the gifts.  There's nothing else you were supposed to talk to with.  But four months go by now.  Oh, my God.  Keeping in touch with her, and we're, what, four weeks out from opening day? 
[02:45:00]  Do you think she doesn't know why you're texting her?  That'd be great.  That's my whole point here.  That's my whole point.  You text her before the last game of when the Yankees are playing, you know, whatever that is.  And then next time you text her, it's opening day.  Whoa.  It's not so bad.  Whoa.  Last time was November for me.  November 7th, and now March 6th is the next time I actually reach out to her.  Plus, she listens to the show, so she knows.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  This pisses her off.  Of course it does.  And she's a big Springsteen fan. 
[02:45:30]  She got me into the Springsteen show.  Who's a big Springsteen?  We were, what, 15 feet from the stage because of her.  Who did I get into?  I gave someone a Springsteen ticket when I went to the Apollo.  Oh.  I don't know if it was her or not.  It might have been.  I don't remember.  She sent me a little something from Yankee Stadium or something.  It might have been her.  But whoever it was couldn't get in.  It had to be her.  So you're hooked up good.  Oh, I don't even know.  I just gave her.  Yeah, you're going to be taking care of that.  But it might not be her.  It might be someone else.  She's not looking for favors.  She's just looking for a little appreciation for a job well done. 
[02:46:00]  I just don't want to waste a ticket.  You know me.  I make sure every ticket gets given away.  So that, of course, is a Jim Norton show.  But I mean anybody else's show, I'll make sure there is.  I get a writer that I finally forgive her for the Pearl Jam mishap.  Yeah, that'll help.  Let her know that she's forgiven.  Jesus.  Apology accepted.  Forgiven.  This is not rebuilding bridges.  Yeah, Opie.  Remember the building bridges thing?  And rebuilding bridges?  I'd build a few.  Yeah, do you smash more along the way? 
[02:46:30]  No, it's about 50.  It's like...  I'm even.  One for one.  Getting a Ripper Clyde feeling here.  Yeah, but I'm not a big Yankees fan.  So I'm wasting a seat anyway.  Nah, because you know what?  Just going to the game is nice.  Are they playing the Phillies this year?  I don't know the schedule.  I don't know the schedule.  That'd be fun.  That'd be kind of cool.  Yankees-Phillies.  Has that ever happened?  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Some.  Are you just saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, they played.  They played each other? 
[02:47:00]  Absolutely, they played.  Yeah.  That'd be kind of cool to say.  I don't know whose record is what, but I mean, I remember the Yankees losing to the  Phillies a few years ago.  In the series.  Did they lose the World Series?  That's right.  In the World Series.  The World Series.  Where's the Miz?  What was that?  That shows you how out of baseball I am.  A few years ago?  Oh, my God.  Well, let me tell you.  I was back in the...  Fucking mad dog.  He just pulls all that info right out of his ass.  Where's the...  It's amazing.  I don't know.  The Phillies have played interleague recently.  What year did they beat the Yankees in the series? 
[02:47:30]  The Phillies in 2009, the World Series.  Yeah.  Yankees beat the Phillies?  Yankees beat the Phillies in 2009.  Did the Phillies beat the Yankees at all?  In the series or no?  Nope.  Oh.  See, it shows you how much of a ball.  Nope.  No.  That has never happened.  God, I can't believe I had to ask that question.  Oh, Jimmy.  I really don't watch baseball.  The Miz is here?  Yep.  Is he a ghost?  Bring him in.  Oh, I thought you meant he's here in studio.  Bring him in. 
[02:48:00]  That's obviously not true.  Excuse me.  What do we talk to him about?  I don't have a sheet.  Where's the sheet?  Isn't this like a 10 o'clock...  This is like...  Oh, but Jimmy's doing his show.  This would have been perfect for your show.  No, it's perfect for your show.  Talking about the Murnine 3, Homefront.  Late Miz.  Out now on Blu-ray.  Late Miz.  How you doing?  Look at him.  How sharp-dressed.  Look at this guy.  Holy Jesus.  Palomino.  You're like him.  What up?  Look at him.  How you doing, man?  We remember you from, you know, 
[02:48:30]  Way back when.  All right.  I just want to always say that to you.  Yes.  You're like such a big star now.  It's so weird to me.  I'm huge.  I'm huge.  What's up, man?  Good to see you.  It's good to be here.  Good to be here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The first time I think I was on the show was like in 2001.  Fuck.  When I did.  We told the whole story.  Well, the VMAs were here.  Right.  And you guys had two people on the red carpet.  We're talking to Laverne and Shirley.  That were slow, I guess you could say.  We're talking to Laverne and Shirley.  And they interviewed everybody.  And I was like, oh my God, I'm the biggest Opie and Anthony fan. 
[02:49:00]  I have to come on your show.  They're like, come on in tomorrow.  So I came in.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  You were doing Real World.  Back to New York, season 10.  Back to New York, season 10.  It was season 10 back in 2001.  Over a decade ago, by the way.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  You know the original New York broad works here now.  No kidding.  I always forget her name.  She's really nice to us every morning.  Heather.  Heather B.  Heather B.  Heather B.  That's like from the original.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  That's like 20 years ago.  Exactly.  We say hi to her every morning.  She looks exactly the same.  She broadcasts right next door. 
[02:49:30]  And did you know, here's another did you know.  In 2000, when I was shooting The Real World Back to New York, I went to a comedy show  at Caroline's and you were there.  Oh, wow.  Was that?  I must have.  You were.  No.  And here's you.  Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch.  Was it Hedberg?  Was it Hedberg?  Hedberg or something like that?  Hedberg or Patel.  Hedberg, I think.  I was working with Mitch Hedberg?  Something like that.  You remember working with Mitch Hedberg?  I knew him, so we worked together.  This was like 12 years ago.  Wow.  So, I mean, but I saw you and I was like, this guy is incredible.  Like, you were the best out of everybody. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, thank you.  Wow, yeah.  I don't remember that week.  That's so cool.  And by the way, in April?  Was it one of those weeks?  No, I just don't remember.  It's like one of those things where you just do so many.  I'm doing it again in April.  And nice to know that in 12 years, it's still not going to be sold out.  I used to have a wrestling chair over my head.  I met Mitch Hedberg the day, the night he died.  Jeez.  Really?  Swear to God.  We went to Caroline's.  Me and my brother-in-law went backstage.  I finally, you know, I was a big fan.  I met him.  We exchanged numbers.  I was going to get him on the show, said goodbye, and a mere few hours later, he was dead. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, really?  Where were you going when it happened?  Exactly.  What was that little bag you had to do?  Yeah, what happened?  It was Caroline's.  Yeah, he did his last show at Caroline's.  He did, right?  I think it was a Sunday or something.  The Sunday night show, and then the next day they found him.  Horrible.  Holy shit.  Well, what does that have to do with The Miz and the Marine Tree?  What a way to drain the radio.  I mean, my God.  What a morning.  What the fuck?  Depressing.  Just bringing up fucking some old stories.  Yeah.  Do you get back to Cleveland ever?  You know, I never get back to Cleveland. 
[02:51:00]  I always want to go back, but, you know, WWE has such a vigorous schedule.  Like, I'm always traveling no matter what.  Like, yesterday we were in Albany the day before that, Buffalo.  Day before that, Kingston, Ontario.  Day before that, Toronto.  It's just nonstop all day, every day.  Wow.  Where's Homebase?  Homebase is Los Angeles now.  So it's 75 and 70.  Yeah, I don't mean, you know, it works out well.  Whenever I'm home.  My real home is like every hotel that I go to, basically.  But that was my follow-up question. 
[02:51:30]  How many days a year do you see your place?  I would say maybe a handful a month.  Wow.  A couple.  It's nonstop every day, all day.  But, you know, I love it.  So let's say 10 days a month you're home.  Basically, yeah.  Probably less than, yeah.  How do you handle that?  It's hard, and I just got engaged.  Congratulations.  Yeah, and so that's even more of a hard thing to do, to try to balance, you know, your relationship  as well as your job.  You're trying to become a successful WWE superstar, be the best, you know, that you possibly can be.  And then you have to, you know, go home and, you know, she has to understand that you're 
[02:52:00]  building for something here.  Wow.  Does she understand you're the Miz?  She does.  She does.  I mean, she's a former WWE diva as well.  That is a very attractive fiancée you have, sir.  Would you expect anything less?  With all due respect.  Very nice.  Wow.  Very pretty.  Thank you.  Very pretty girl.  And not only is she very pretty, but she's got a great head on her shoulders, so.  Really?  I lucked out on this one.  How did you find that?  Wow.  I know.  It's a rarity.  How did I find that?  How did she find me?  Oh, yes.  Is what you should be talking about. 
[02:52:30]  Exactly.  How long have you been dating her?  Five years.  Oh, that's a well.  Wow, man.  That's great.  And you have adjusted to hotel rooms?  What's that?  Have you adjusted to the hotel rooms at this point?  I've been going for, what, since 2006 with the WWE, so I've been in every single kind  of crappy hotel to amazing hotels.  Yeah.  Are you one of the guys that Vince puts under good accommodations?  You know, yeah.  I mean, sometimes here and there.  I mean, we went to Qatar one year, and I had this master suite where it was the most incredible 
[02:53:00]  thing I've ever...  It's better than my house.  And out there, you'd think in the Middle East, I didn't realize how much money is out  there, but it is incredible.  Like, they just are loading up with everything possible you can imagine.  Yeah, yeah.  That's got to be nice out there.  My brother just got back from the Middle East.  Stayed in a nice hotel, too.  Where did he go?  He was in Abu Dhabi.  I've been to Abu Dhabi as well.  We've been...  I mean, WWE goes all over the world. 
[02:53:30]  I mean, you name it, we've been there.  We've been to China, Japan, Philippines, all over the Middle East.  Do you guys still go to Mexico or no?  Oh, of course.  You know, because Mexico's dangerous, so a lot of...  I think Daniel will fight there.  I mean, I think...  We make tours there every year.  Oh, you do.  What's the coolest place you've been to?  I mean, China.  I never thought of my wildest dreams that I would perform in China, and I thought it  was absolutely incredible.  Call her Joni.  No.  We don't allow China and WWE.  Remember her?  What was cool about China?  Big clit. 
[02:54:00]  It's my favorite part.  Small penis.  Small penis.  We studied it.  Just the fact that it was the first show we've ever done out there, and the fans were just  so excited to have fans that don't speak your language to chant, you're awesome.  That's crazy.  It's pretty sweet.  So, yeah, I got to be the first match.  It was actually Yara Sum, which is asshole.  Yeah.  I mean, I probably got that chanted to me as well, especially me, of all people.  Oh, man.  But do you like China itself? 
[02:54:30]  What city were you guys in?  We were in, I believe, Beijing.  I can't even remember.  Beijing.  I don't even think that's it.  Well, did you get to walk around a little bit, or was it more or less in and out?  It was in and out.  We were in there for one day and literally out the next.  And they know all the storylines.  They know all the storylines and everything.  They know everything.  That's amazing.  They knew everything.  They had merchandise.  Wow.  You know, it's above and beyond amazing.  More amazing than that, it was Spurlock's documentary, I believe, when he was hunting for Osama 
[02:55:00]  Bin Laden, and he was in the Middle East.  That worked out.  And what they showed over and over again was all the fans you got in the Middle East,  and they were all wearing the wrestling T-shirts, and they had the WWE on their TVs.  Yeah, those are always my favorite shows, because you'll see fans in burkas chanting like,  you suck.  Wow.  It's like, we had one show.  It was just for the kings and queens and the princes and their families and friends.  And after the show, the kids kind of tried to get into the ring. 
[02:55:30]  We were already backstage and everything like that, and we were just watching the set,  and we were like, oh my god, kids are in the ring.  The security were trying to get the kids, and the kids go like, no, no, no, and then  point to their dad like, listen, my dad will get you if you touch me.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's like that.  So you performed for the king?  Huh?  You performed for the king?  Yeah, kings, queens of all over the Middle East.  Did you interact with them at all?  Not at all, no.  I mean, obviously they interacted between, out there in the audience. 
[02:56:00]  How big of a show was it just for them?  Was it just for them?  Yeah, it was just for them.  It was just their families, their friends.  It was like 2,000 people.  Oh, that's actually more than I thought.  Yeah.  Oh, they got a lot of fucking family.  We got a lot of fans.  Yeah.  No, that's what I'm saying.  But I figured for a king and queen show, those small private events, sometimes they'll  do concerts for just 50 or 100 people, and it's probably weird, but they're used to  it.  Yeah.  And you guys got to make your own travel still?  Well, not flights, but we'll get to a location, then we'll do our rental cars and our hotels.  It just makes everything easier, for us at least. 
[02:56:30]  No, we bring it up because Mick Foley's a good friend of ours, and his stories are hilarious.  He's a little thrifty.  He rides a skateboard when he gets to a city.  He got down to the point where he was like, what, sleeping on fans' couches and stuff to  save a few bucks as champion.  Yeah.  As champion, though.  I hear those stories, and I get saving money.  I get it.  Right.  But if I'm going to spend something, I'm going to spend something on my health.  Right.  And get a nice, comfortable bed and get some good sleep.  This wasn't when he was coming up.  He said when he had the belt. 
[02:57:00]  He had the belt, and he was sleeping on fans' couches.  Yeah.  And sleeping in airports because, you know, when we get done with the shows, it's like midnight  and our flights are at 6 a.m.  So you're in your hotel for, what, two hours?  So some people would just go to the airport and sleep.  No way.  I'm more like, listen, I'm going to go to my hotel.  I'm going to have a nice, comfortable sleep for two hours and then fly home.  Or at least get a hot shower.  Something, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Let's chill out.  Man, they go right to the airport and just sleep.  Yeah, right to the airport and go to sleep.  I mean, that's back in the old days.  I don't think people do that now. 
[02:57:30]  I think we're smarter with our money.  That's probably for guys that check out that day.  They probably check out at 1, go to the arena, do the match.  And they don't want to pay for the extra day in the hotel.  Oh, just leave.  It's just a long day, though, without putting your head down, even for a quick nap.  Exactly.  Well, nowadays, I mean, even on Monday Night Raw, I'll have like a 6 a.m. media day  where I'll go from 6 a.m. all the way till 2, go to the building, do the whole show.  And this is the day before I was in some other city, had to drive to the town, 
[02:58:00]  probably got in around 1 or 2, put my head down,  and then I'm performing on Monday Night Raw with zero sleep.  And people are like, man, you look so tired.  And I'm like, yeah, you want to know why?  Because I did media all morning to promote for this show,  which I don't mind, but it's still like, you look tired.  Thanks, people.  I appreciate it.  I'm performing.  I'm doing this for you.  I'm entertaining for you, all right?  I get no sleep for you.  Wait, you're trying to tell me you got haters?  Yeah, me?  Me?  I know, yeah, right?  Well, it's still real to me, damn it! 
[02:58:30]  Are you a bad guy?  Are you considered a bad guy?  Right now, I'm a good guy.  I've been a bad guy for the past, like, six years.  And I've always considered myself like a good guy, you know?  But everyone else just booed the hell out of me and told me how much I sucked.  And I'm awful.  They wanted me out of the WWE.  I mean, anytime you come from an outside source, like the real world and a reality star,  everyone's going to automatically hate you.  But I think I've developed enough respect, not only from the locker room, from the WWE  universe, that now they're starting to cheer me.  You worked real hard.  Yeah.  Because I remember at NAW, you were talking to us and saying, I want to go into wrestling. 
[02:59:00]  And I remember, no offense, because now you're the Miz.  I'm like, wow, that seems like a weird career path.  Like, that might not work out.  Yeah, my parents weren't too happy about it when I told them I want to be a WWE superstar  instead of going to college.  I remember the day you told us you wanted this, and you worked fucking hard, obviously.  Yeah, I mean, I moved to Los Angeles, paid my $2,500 to learn the art of professional  wrestling, went to UPW, Ultimate Pro Wrestling, out there, and just started working on the  independent scenes.  And you'd think, since I was on the real world and I did a bunch of challenges, saying, 
[02:59:30]  hey, WWE, I want to be a WWE superstar, they'd be like, oh, man, open arms.  Not so much.  Not at all.  So I had to try out for Tough Enough, which is the reality show that you could win a WWE  contract.  And I ended up not winning because the fans got to vote, and the fans have always hated  me.  But the WWE execs, I guess I impressed them so much that they gave me a developmental  contract.  Wait, who won that year?  Daniel Pewter.  And where is he now?  Who knows?  Wow. 
[03:00:00]  That's a hilarious idea.  See what I just did for you, Miz?  Thank you very much.  I did that for you today.  That makes me feel good.  I did that for you.  Damn.  I don't know that name.  Did he get in at all, or no?  Well, he was there for a little bit.  I think maybe a year, and then he basically cashed in.  Wait, I gotta remember that guy.  That's not a wrestling name.  No one's gonna chant Daniel Pewter.  That's a terrible name.  They didn't know what to do with him.  He barely did anything.  And then he tried MMA, too.  That didn't work for him, either.  Yikes.  Too bad for him.  Now I sit before you, a former WWE champion person that may have vetted WrestleMania 27. 
[03:00:30]  So I think I did pretty well for myself.  And now starting in the Marine 3 home front.  Yeah, that's why you're here.  We should promote the movie, the Marine 3.  Let's do it.  Home front, out now on Blu-ray.  What's it about?  Basically, I play a Marine that's having trouble adapting to coming home.  Rainbow.  Well, I've been to Iraq.  Basically, yeah.  I've been to Iraq.  I've been to Afghanistan.  I've been to Bahrain.  I got to see, you know, with WWE, we do tribute to the troops every year.  And I got to see how our troops prepare for battle.  And some of the stories that I've heard is when they go back home, it's hard to adapt to the normalcy of just, you know, sitting around relaxing. 
[03:01:00]  So that's kind of the story.  He goes home.  He's butting hands with his friends.  You know, he's overprotective with his sisters until his sister witnesses a murder.  She gets kidnapped by a terrorist kind of extremist group.  Yeah.  And do I save the day?  I don't know.  I bet.  But the villain is played by Neil McDonough, who is famed for Justified, as well as Minority Report and Captain America. 
[03:01:30]  So they surrounded me with a good team.  Oh, nice.  So a lot of ass-kicking, obviously.  Yeah.  I mean, I do a lot of it in the ring, and now I do a lot of it in a movie.  So it's definitely cool.  First movie?  Oh, that guy's great.  First big screen, yeah.  How was his role?  It was amazing, man.  It's not every day you get to have a bunch of takes.  You know, right now we're live.  You flub a word, people chant you.  You know, in WWE, you flub a word, people chant, you suck for three minutes.  Right.  So that guy that's in the movie is in Band of Brothers.  That's that guy.  Yeah, he's been a villain in everything.  He's good. 
[03:02:00]  This guy's been killed by every hero known to man.  Now, did Vince give you the time off to film the movie, or did you have to do both?  I got a whole one month.  Oh, he gave me a month.  By the way, filming this movie, it was the first time I was in the same bed for more  than a week in my entire career in WWE.  I couldn't believe it.  Like, it was the coolest thing.  Like, people are like, what's your most memorable moment about being, filming this movie?  And you'd think it'd be like, oh, man, I play with guns, explosions, you know. 
[03:02:30]  No, sleeping in the same bed for 20 days was my most memorable moment because I don't get  that luxury anymore.  That's fucked up.  Is it?  You guys are fucked up a lot.  But no, but I know it's exciting.  This is what we want to do.  I mean, we get to perform in front of 20,000 people.  I mean, I was just performing in front of 20,000 people in a sold-out Buffalo arena cheering  me.  I mean, that's what we live for.  That's what it's all about, entertaining the audiences.  So, as much as I complain and, you know, like, man, I never get to sleep in the same 
[03:03:00]  bed, we get to entertain and do something that no one else gets to do.  I mean, Jim, you must get to do that as well.  Yes, but I get to look at a lot of empty chair backs.  But it is still nice to have a microphone and have people to talk to who decide to show  up.  But, you know, sold-out shows must be nice.  But half-empty shows are good.  No.  Did you take acting classes or did anybody coach you?  Yeah, I studied so much for this role.  Like, I didn't want people to look at it and go, oh, that's Mike from The Real World or 
[03:03:30]  The Miz from WWE.  I wanted a whole new character.  So, I studied with a guy named Alan McRae and we basically looked into this and I was  like, okay, who are the action heroes that I looked up to when I was a kid or, you know,  movies that I enjoyed.  And I was thinking, all right, The Good, The Bad, The Ugly with Clint Eastwood, you know,  Dirty Harry.  Whenever Clint Eastwood walks on the scene, you know, it's basically, it's an aura.  It's a star power.  You know, he doesn't even have to say a word and he's absolutely incredible. 
[03:04:00]  And I told you, come and say hi.  From The Real World.  I don't think I've ever met her.  Actually, I think I've met her once in a while.  Oh, my God.  See?  It's nice to meet you.  My nephew told me all about you.  And I was like, oh, shit.  We were just talking nicely about you, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Thank you guys so much.  Oh, man.  I've never actually been in here.  And I heard you were in the building.  I was like, I've never met him.  A couple of real world alumni.  I know.  This is crazy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And we're old school, by the way.  Like, well, she's old, old school. 
[03:04:30]  I'm semi old school.  Wow.  We don't think you're old, old school.  Well, I mean, she's the originator.  She's an original.  Yeah, she's an original.  So it's like, that's old school.  I mean, you know, that's original.  She's the founder of this thing.  Now, 28 seasons later.  Did you ever think?  It's like a fraternity, man.  You guys, I could see.  I know.  You've been through the experience together.  Thank you.  John Brennan always speaks highly of you.  Oh, my God, John.  Yeah, he speaks highly of you.  True story.  True story.  I know.  I do that a lot, too.  But I just wanted to come and say hi. 
[03:05:00]  I was so happy.  I just feel like we went to the same school or something.  Yeah, exactly.  It's almost like a family with the rear-wheelers and road rollers.  It's every time you meet people, it's like, oh, my God, I was on the show.  I was like, oh, then we have something in common.  Right.  It seems like everyone slept with each other, too.  Oh, my God.  No sex on my season.  No, no, no.  Really?  No, only the cast member got the director kicked off.  Becky, she got the director fired because she slept with him in Jamaica.  They tried to get up to go with some Jamaicans, but that didn't work out. 
[03:05:30]  Only the crew and the cast hooked up.  Yeah, none of our cast really hooked up as well.  The only people that was hooking up was me, and I was bringing girls in.  And the weird part was, I don't know on your season, but on my season, we had cameras in the rooms,  and we didn't realize they were, you could see in the dark at that time, by the way.  That wasn't happening.  It never happened.  And so, like, I remember, you know, watching it with my mother, and my, you know, just, you know, 
[03:06:00]  because we don't get advanced copies, you know, so I'm watching it on TV with everybody else,  and Coral's like, Mike had sex in the bed.  And then it shows me, like, under the covers, like, you know, in that green, like, lighting,  and I'm like, and she's looking at, my mom's looking at me like, oh, my God, Michael.  And I'm like, Mom, I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  Yeah, stop watching it, Mom.  But I was like, Mom, you have to admit she's a pretty girl.  So, I mean, at least you can be proud of me about that, right? 
[03:06:30]  I just remember you being in love with Larry Johnson.  I was so in love with Larry Johnson.  I was excited.  Anytime I hear the name Larry Johnson, I instantly think of you.  Really?  Because you became synonymous with Larry Johnson.  Are we talking about Charlotte Hornets?  Yes.  Yes.  Like, are we going?  Yes.  Yes.  It was hilarious.  You went to the game, and you got to, like, and you're like, oh, there he is.  And it was hilarious.  I had no idea what I was going to say.  I love sports, basketball and football in particular, and just fell in love with him when he was at UNLV. 
[03:07:00]  And it was an opportunity.  When they asked me during the audition, who would I like to meet?  I said, Larry Johnson.  He said, who the hell is Larry Johnson?  And so, I said, I would go to a game when he comes to play the New Jersey Nets.  And when I saw him, I just said, I heard you wanted to meet me.  And our whole conversation started from there.  He was really nice.  I ran into him a couple of times.  Oh, really?  Afterwards, he was really nice.  And he's just been cool.  You know, I haven't seen him in a while.  Wow.  But I always tell him I'm famous now, too.  You know.  So, it's all good. 
[03:07:30]  That's great, man.  But I just wanted to come and say hi, Mike.  And it's really good to meet you.  I've never seen you at any reunion shows or anything.  So, I just wanted to say hi.  Congratulations with everything.  Well, it was a pleasure meeting you as well.  You too.  And thank you.  Good luck with everything.  Thank you so much.  All right.  No, take care.  All right.  Actually, hopped in.  Take it easy.  Bye.  That's so cool.  You've got to love Sirius XM, right?  That's so cool.  Oh, my God.  You never know who's going to pop in.  She's been really nice to us.  You know, I see her all the time and say hello.  I didn't know she was ever on a TV show.  The original real world.  The original.  The originator right there. 
[03:08:00]  That was the one that was like, wow.  Heather.  Heather, right?  Heather B.  She's very nice.  Her, Eric Neese.  Eric Neese.  Norman.  I remember these days.  And the little skinny white girl that was a dancer.  Mindy Cone?  That was her name.  Someone will get it down here.  I haven't thought of these names in a long time.  Maybe.  Maybe someone will get it.  So they invite you to the reunion shows and all that, and you just don't do it, huh?  Well, not even that.  We've even had one in a very long time.  And any time they do, I've actually hosted some of the reunion shows for Real World and 
[03:08:30]  Real World World's Challenges.  But we just never cross paths.  I go to the reunion shows.  I'm not one of those people that I'm like, oh, well, I have to stay away because I'm a new  WWE superstar now.  Of course you go.  Then you look and go, look what I did.  Look at me.  I'm a WWE superstar.  So what are you doing?  Oh, I'm a WWE superstar.  The Real World really got fucked up.  I mean, you know, now they just get them drunk and they're in the house. 
[03:09:00]  But isn't that what you want to see?  You want to see that train wreck.  You want to see fights.  You want to see yelling.  But how long were you in the house?  Five months.  Now they're doing it differently.  They're doing barely a month.  Three months.  No.  The Challenges are one month.  But the Real World is three months now.  So they're still putting in some time.  And I was in New York City.  By the way, I was a college student.  I didn't have money.  And when you're in New York City, it's hard to get by on that college salary.  And they're not paying you when you're on the Real World.  They're not like, oh, hey, since you're on TV, here's money. 
[03:09:30]  Let me fill up the food.  No.  We have to pay for our own alcohol, too.  And I wasn't even 21 at the time, so I had to have a fake ID and everything.  They didn't give you a taste?  They didn't give you food?  No.  Nothing.  I had to buy my own food.  How do they justify that?  Because it's the real world.  You're living like you would in a real situation.  It's not like, you know, it's as real as real can be on TV.  Yeah.  Julie Gentry.  Julie Gentry.  Very good.  That's Julie.  She was, I remember her dancing to that. 
[03:10:00]  It's a wiggle it, just a little bit.  And she's fucking like really going at it and shit.  I have no memory of that.  That's how long ago?  20 some odd fucking.  I didn't.  Crazy.  I watched the set.  I started watching the second season more than the first.  I think everyone has their season that they watch.  I was a real world New Orleans fan.  Really?  The one with Puck was great.  Puck was so amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  Puck and Pedro.  Puck and Pedro.  You put your fingers in the peanut butter, Puck.  I'm not going to sit here while you put your fingers in the peanut butter. 
[03:10:30]  I think that's like the most known line in real world history.  You put your fingers in my peanut butter.  You're picking scabs.  And then you put your fingers in the peanut butter.  You're picking those in your snot rockets.  And the kid was deteriorating right in front of your eyes.  Oh, he did the guy.  Oh, yes.  Oh, God.  He died shortly after that season came out.  He was AIDS, right?  He had HIV.  Oh, yeah.  They had his T-cell count every week.  Remember all that?  Yeah, yeah.  There was good news and a lot of bad news. 
[03:11:00]  And I remember being at a Black Crow show when they announced he died.  Really?  It was shortly after that season was on TV.  Mm, man.  No more than a year later.  Yeah, it was definitely sad and tragic.  But I think that's the first time that you saw a person with HIV or AIDS on national television.  And that's what, you know, the real world brought such new stuff to the table.  You realized they were real people.  Yeah, exactly.  It was the real world.  It touched your hearts.  And then Los Angeles.  And then you came to me on the real world back to New York, running around naked and just doing whatever and getting into fights. 
[03:11:30]  You know, it used to stand for something.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it's just drinking and fighting.  Mm-hmm.  Exactly.  What happened to TV?  Now it's Honey Boo Boo.  Yeah.  Has a show.  I know.  It's just so scripted now.  Everything's fucking...  Yeah, that's what I don't like about you.  Back in my day, when I was on the real world back to New York, it wasn't scripted.  Yeah, yeah.  There wasn't these scripted realities.  Now it's like everyone has a reality show.  And if that person has a reality show, their butler has a reality show. 
[03:12:00]  Yep.  And if they're butler, their limo driver has.  I mean, come on.  And it's like, you know, what happened to people just living their lives on TV?  Well, that's how bad also that scripts have gotten, is that people would rather watch these  fucking dildos competing for some non-prize than watch scripted TV, because scripted TV  stinks so badly.  Well, because they all want the success the Osbournes had.  Yeah, and they can't recapture that.  The Osbournes were one of the last reality shows where they didn't push the storylines.  Yeah.  Sharon said there was never a take two. 
[03:12:30]  It was what it was, and they made what they made out of it.  And that's exactly what the real world was.  We've got to get Mike, a.k.a. The Miz, out of here.  He's a busy guy.  I didn't even promote WrestleMania 29 coming to MetLife Stadium April 7th, but I just did  right there.  There you go.  You don't even have to promote it.  I know.  I mean, it's...  Yeah.  You're right.  I like you to...  Yeah.  I'm going.  Of course I'm going.  Yeah, I mean...  I got his...  I'm still going with you, right?  Yeah, I mean...  I have an extra...  You all should be going to WrestleMania 29 at MetLife Stadium. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, fuck yeah, I want to go.  The last WrestleMania we went to was...  Was it...  2000.  Anaheim.  Yeah.  Anaheim.  That was mega years ago.  This one is going to be incredible.  I mean, you have The Rock, the WWE Champion taking on John Cena.  You know, you have Jack Swagger going up against Alberto Doria for the World Heavyweight Championship.  You have me there.  I mean, that's all you really need.  I mean, what people are going to be talking about.  You know, Rock and Cena, that's fantastic.  But at the end of the day, at WrestleMania, people are going to be talking about The Miz and  where The Miz did to steal the show.  Will Fandango be there? 
[03:13:30]  Fandango.  Fandango.  Fandango.  You've got to say it right.  You've got to relax the A.  You've got to say it right.  That's the most ridiculous gimmick.  That's hilarious.  That's the best part about WWE.  You never know what you're going to get.  You have the most ridiculous...  I mean, one of the number one shows on TV right now is Dancing with the Stars.  Really?  Really?  Stars dancing?  So, I mean, what do we have?  We have Fandango.  I trashed it earlier, but I've got to be honest. 
[03:14:00]  It's kind of funny, man.  It is funny.  It's ridiculous.  It's got me laughing when you decide he's not wrestling because the guy won't pronounce  his name properly.  What's your name in the Marine?  Jake Carter.  USMC.  Jake Carter.  I knew it had to be something good.  Jake.  Jake Carter.  All right.  The Marine 3, home front, out now on Blu-ray.  It's Mike The Miz on Twitter.  I don't know, man.  Come back and see us around WrestleMania.  Promote everything.  We've got it all.  WrestleMania.  We've got it all.  I mean, I'm in everything nowadays. 
[03:14:30]  Also, just to finish up a storyline from earlier, our ticket lady wrote back in.  Oh, what'd she say?  She wrote, wow, what did I do to deserve a text from Greg Opie Hughes?  And then she writes, I'm getting ready for baseball season.  Want to come out?  I wrote her because baseball season around the corner and she bought it hook, line, and  sinker.  Oh, don't say that.  Bought it hook, line, and sinker.  And Jimmy's got Charlotte.  Jimmy, what are you promoting?  Charlotte this weekend, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Toledo the following weekend just to give this shit. 
[03:15:00]  We all.  We all do.  And Mike, it's still doing well, man.  Thank you guys so much for having me out here, man.  And I've been back in the day for Sex and Sam, man.  That was the good.  Back when I was in Cleveland, I would sit there just listening to the radio all day long.  Sex for Sam was one of the greatest bits I've ever heard in my entire life.  Granted, it got you taken off air, but it was worth it, wasn't it?  It was worth it.  To me, it was worth it because it was such great radio.  We're still doing damage assessments.  We're still trying to climb out of that hole eight years, ten years later. 
[03:15:30]  You guys are incredible.  You've always been incredible.  You make amazing radio.  And thank you very much for having me.  It's an absolute honor to be on the show.  I like this.  You're putting us over.  I am because I was back in the day, man.  Yes.  Back in the day.  I've been a fan ever since.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you so much for coming.  The Miz, everyone.  Have a blast.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Later.  Oh, Jimmy.  Okay.  Jimmy's show is up next.  They know.  Stay tuned.  Okay.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  Jim Norton is not going anywhere. 
[03:16:00]  If you have problems at home, it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show is next.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor.  And your chance to speak directly with him has arrived.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now. 
[03:16:30]  You know, that dumb intro plays every week, and I hear it, but you don't listen to it  when you hear it, because, you know, you hear it every week.  But it is true.  A moderately successful comedian.  Like, that was kind of sarcastic and joking.  But just, ugh.  I just want to fucking sell out in advance once in a while.  You know, we all have things in our job that annoy us.  Obsessing over ticket sales is a thing in my job that I hate.  And you probably never get beyond it. 
[03:17:00]  I mean, no matter what level you're on, you know, if you're an arena act, you're probably  obsessed if the arena is three quarters sold and not sold out, or if you're only doing  one show and not doing two.  I mean, I'm sure every level has its problems, just like all your jobs do.  And these are luxury problems to have.  I mean, I'm lucky to have these problems.  If you told me when I was 18 that I'd be 44 and worried about a sellout comedy show,  I would have signed up for that in a second.  So the phones are ringing.  We'll take your calls and hopefully just not drive you to throw yourself in front of a train.  Who's first, young Eric? 
[03:17:30]  Tom in Massachusetts.  He's going to one of your gigs coming up.  Oh, okay.  Tom?  Hey, hey, what's going on, Jimmy?  Hi, Tom.  I've got a question for you.  I'm going to see you in Somerville, and I've got a Patrice poster.  I was wondering, do you think it would be appropriate for me to bring it and have you sign, or no?  Yeah, of course.  But if you have Patrice poster, of course I'll sign them.  I'm doing a show in Somerville, Massachusetts.  I believe both shows are sold out.  I'm shooting them the 29th.  So, yeah, bring your poster. 
[03:18:00]  I'll be happy to sign it.  I'm actually really, really looking forward to this.  It's the only thing that really I'm looking forward to at this point in life.  Okay, perfect.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I'm looking forward to it, too.  I'll see you there.  Okay, brother.  See you there.  Thank you for coming.  Let's go to Jason Cleveland.  He's having an identity crisis.  Oh, good.  Hey, what's up, Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  I'm a loyal fan, and I saw you last year in Cleveland, and I hope you sell out that Toledo show.  Thank you.  I've been a loyal fan for over, like, five years now.  I remember going back with you on Patrice. 
[03:18:30]  I go way back, but I listen to some of the things that recently came up on the show, and being a black listener, it's kind of disturbing because I don't think I'm conflicted about the humor.  I have no problem with race humor and words and context, but I don't know if y'all are actually getting both sides of the story.  I actually see it from some African-American side. 
[03:19:00]  Well, what is it that you feel I'm personally missing?  Well, it's not as much as you because you seem to actually get in.  You seem to actually understand how Anthony's hurt me, like, recently, especially with the eugenics stuff.  It makes me feel like I'm a lesser human being because I just happen to be black at either supposed to be some kind of talking points when I don't know exactly how I should feel about this and how I should feel about hell. 
[03:19:30]  Well, it's like anything else.  I mean, you know, whenever talking points for anything come up, whether it's here or whether it's CNN or Fox or MSNB, wherever it is, you take what you need and you leave the rest.  I mean, you know, there's going to be things you hear which you disagree with, and this is for any listener, not just yourself or not just racial stuff.  And whatever it is that you disagree with, I mean, I love when guys call in and tell us what they don't like, as long as they're being reasonable, which you're being reasonable. 
[03:20:00]  One thing our show could use more of is a balance for that.  Because a lot of times it's me and Ann or me and Ope, we're just all talking about stuff, but it would help if we had somebody else in, like an expert on the other side, or an expert, period.  None of us are experts.  So maybe we could use some more balance in the discussions, but just, you know, it would make for interesting radio just to have those guests in.  But, you know, as far as an identity crisis, why would you feel any way at all about yourself? 
[03:20:30]  I mean, you're just hearing the opinion of radio guys.  Who gives a shit what we think, or Anthony thinks, or Opey or myself?  Well, I went to a school system that was 50% white, 50% black in the Cleveland area.  And I've always been on, I've always danced this edge that I never really fit into either side.  I'm big into cars and drag racing and NASCAR and stuff, but I'm a DJ too. 
[03:21:00]  So you like things that white guys typically like?  I like cars and DJs, I like cars and country music and all that, but yet I can hang out with niggas also, you know?  And it makes so, I can jump both sides, but yet I don't seem to fit into either world.  And it makes it kind of hard to try to find yourself.  See, don't forget too, sir, when you're hearing this show, like, you know, Ann expresses opinions, you know what I mean, that a lot of white guys won't express. 
[03:21:30]  Some are right, some are wrong, and some are just exaggerated for the radio or caught up in the moment.  But when you listen to black talk radio and, you know, black stations, you hear a lot of racial talk.  And I don't mean all the time, but when they talk about it, they talk about it honestly.  The problem is that when white people talk about it and you hear maybe somebody who's more in one direction than from the center, it sounds crazy because white people have become so full of shit when discussing race. 
[03:22:00]  That anybody not discussing it a certain way comes off as crazy.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, you hear, like, a lot of hardcore black guys talk about race.  And, you know, a lot of times you don't agree with them, but they don't sound crazy.  But when a white guy is just as far off center as that, they sound crazy because you're not used to hearing it.  I mean, that's just my take on it.  But, I mean, I hope you keep listening to the show, and maybe we could use some more balance.  I would love to.  I'm obsessed with interviewing Louis Farrakhan, but he won't come on the show. 
[03:22:30]  So, but I would love to get a Nation of Islam guy in here.  Like, I love talking to those guys.  I mean, it would be really nice if you do get someone on.  Someone from the Cleveland area that you probably might want to look into is this guy named Art McCoy.  He's a community activist, and he's kind of out on that fringe.  Okay.  So, he might want to start looking into them and see if he can't get them on the show.  I think it'll be an interesting talk to y'all.  All right.  Thank you for calling, man.  I appreciate it.  And just keep listening.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:23:00]  Thank you.  All right, buddy.  Yes.  Let's go to Anthony on Long Island.  Oh, okay.  Hi.  Hi, Anthony.  I was listening to that guy.  Obviously, I wouldn't just call in to take up your air time, but obviously he was directing his comments towards moi.  So, you know what?  My point of view is that it is balanced all over the media because blacks get their point across every goddamn day in the media. 
[03:23:30]  It's some kind of crime.  It's some kind of crime to offend a black person based on their race.  It's the coddling, the coddling, the ultra-sensitivity that white people need to put on black people on a daily basis is infuriating, and that's the only reason why people think I take it to the extreme when I talk about race and I talk about different theories on race and poverty and eugenics, whatever it is. 
[03:24:00]  Whatever I'm bringing up, it's just discussion.  I don't know everything, but I think we should be allowed to discuss anything without people getting so fucking turned off and upset and insulted.  I mean, black people really have to lighten the fuck up with not being able to feel that they can be spoken about.  You said something that was very true, and it's almost like whatever is the real sore point or the real nerve in what's happening in the world is kind of what we talk about more, and it's what people who are being funny or whatever tend to go towards. 
[03:24:30]  And I noticed a lot more racial talk started after Imus got fired.  That was a tremendous line in the sand as far as language and what you can say, and it made me focus on it more, almost like, oh, this is the thing we can't talk about?  This is now the thing that gets you in trouble?  Well, fuck you.  So you almost are rebelling against the idea of that or against the penalty for that and saying things – and I don't mean you, I mean all of us – saying things that are purposefully almost provocative to the idea of being penalized for them. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  No one likes being told they can or can't say anything as an adult, especially when it's something that isn't directly inciting a riot or literally causing physical harm to somebody.  We don't like being told you can't say something, and having that held over our heads as people I'm talking about. 
[03:25:30]  Absolutely.  I'm just a little whitey.  So when a guy like that calls – and I even understand his point.  I mean, it's got to be bad to have to listen to something that is insulting to you.  But, you know, hey, that's fucking life.  I listen to shit every day that's insulting to me.  That's right.  It's coming out of my own goddamn mouth.  So, you know, I don't want to take up all your time.  No, no, that's right.  You're doing a great job, and I'm listening on my way home. 
[03:26:00]  I love my Jimmy.  But how are you?  Let's get to the bottom of this.  Let's get to the bottom of said Anthony.  Now that you've called the advice show, this is what it's really about.  Let's take care of Anthony.  And let's –  On my phone, I can't – I'm losing the connection.  That's right.  Between yourself and humanity.  Oh, I do love Ant.  Who's next?  Let's go to Chris in Charlotte.  He wants to talk about approaching you at a show.  Oh, okay. 
[03:26:30]  That's not my advice.  Hey, Joe, I'm going to the Comedy Zone in Charlotte this weekend.  Okay.  Thank you.  And I'm really looking forward to it, but I'm nervous about – how do I approach you to get a picture taken with you after the show at Comedy Zone in Charlotte this weekend?  You can just walk up to me.  Believe me, there'll be plenty of fucking room to move around in the club.  So just walk up and say hello, dude.  It's fine.  I'm very approachable and I'm easy.  And eventually somebody will shoot me because I'm approachable.  So just come up and say hi.  It's very easy.  Everybody listening, go to fucking Charlotte this weekend. 
[03:27:00]  Jimmy North's going to kill.  You're going to love Charlotte, Jimmy.  You're going to love it.  I hear it's a great city.  Thank you very much, buddy.  And I hope you enjoy the show.  Thank you.  Uh, Jess in North Dakota has a problem with his wife sleeping with another woman.  Oh, okay.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Um, I don't have a problem with my wife sleeping with another woman.  Uh, there's been a couple of times where we – we got this – a friend of ours that we go out and we hang out and one thing leads to another. 
[03:27:30]  And we end up having a three-way, yet it's more of a two-way and I'm just stuck there watching.  Okay.  The first time we ever did anything, uh, my wife didn't say anything at first, but I paid for it for like three days later.  For the next three days, she's like, what'd you let her touch your penis for?  What'd you let her suck your dick for?  It's like, well, I thought this is what we were doing.  I thought it was okay, but how do I get – how do I get her to be like, okay, I'm fine with you doing whatever with another woman, but when do I get to have my fun with it? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, that jealousy stuff.  I figured that's what it was because, you know, she wants to get her pussy eaten or she wants to go down on the other woman, but if you get your dick sucked, you're a fucking criminal.  And then you have to make a decision like, okay, it's probably always going to be imbalanced like this.  Now, do you – are you willing to just take the hotness of watching her with another woman and just jerking yourself off or only fucking your wife?  Or are you willing to risk not having threesomes at all by saying, look, if you're going to go down on her, then I want to go down on her. 
[03:28:30]  Or if she's going to go down on you, then I want her to suck my cock.  It's like you have to make that decision on what's more important to you.  Because you have to think also – I mean, it's easy for me to trash your wife, but then how would you feel if there was another guy in the picture?  Obviously, you and the other guy probably wouldn't be jerking each other off.  But could you watch her fuck another guy or could you watch her suck another guy?  Actually, we've been in that situation before, and I don't know why. 
[03:29:00]  It actually kind of turned me on to watch her fuck another guy.  All right, so that's a dangerous thing because you're okay with it, and you watched it, and you allowed her to explore that, but then she's giving you shit.  But that breeds a lot of resentment in a relationship when things are imbalanced like that, or it sounds corny, but unfairness.  Like, if you watched her fuck somebody and you were okay with it and you didn't give her shit the next day, she should not be giving you shit about having the girl suck you. 
[03:29:30]  So she's got to deal with her insecurity or else you shouldn't have the threesomes.  Yeah, and the fucked up thing for me is, you know, when that was happening, you know, I told every party involved, I said, I'm not doing nothing unless it's okay with my wife.  And she said, yeah, that's fine, whatever, you know, and I think it was mainly because she wanted to try a different dick, which is fine, whatever.  But I started fucking the other girl that was in the group, and, you know, for the next three, four days later, I'm fucking dealing with, ah, you did that, well, fuck what you did. 
[03:30:00]  Wait, she got fucked and then criticized you for fucking?  Yes, a little bit.  How do you tolerate that? Put your foot down.  Well, we've gotten through it. I told her straight out, I said, if this is the way it's going to be, it's just never going to happen again.  And it was to the point where I was packing my shit ready to leave, but hammered it all out.  But do you think maybe it might have a little bit to do with it?  You know, I'm almost 36 years old, and I have a lot of fucking experience when it comes to being with other women. 
[03:30:30]  My wife, not so much. She's with the same man for 16 years.  I understand that, and I understand jealousy, and it's easier said than done.  But because you've done the other thing, and because she wants the luxury of going down on this woman, or this woman going down on her,  it has to be the same for both of you.  Unless you're willing to accept that.  Like, if you're willing to go, like, fuck it, she won't let me touch the girl, but I love watching them together.  Well, then just kind of, just swallow that and enjoy what you have.  But if it's going to eat at you, and you're going to resent it, like, you can't be doing these things and then both resenting each other after. 
[03:31:00]  Fuck her, she wouldn't let me get blown?  What is, what's, you know, and then she's like, well, fuck him, he had to touch the other girl.  It can't be that way.  It's either you're both going to be okay with it, or you shouldn't do it.  I'm perfectly fine with it.  I mean, what, what man in their right mind is going to have, is going to fucking say,  I don't want to do that anymore because I won't, you won't let me suck, won't let her suck my dick?  Fuck that.  I'm going to let my wife go down on another bitch.  It's fucking hot.  See, that might interfere with me doing it.  That might annoy me because I, again, the, the annoyance of knowing she can do something I can't would probably make me go, well, fuck her. 
[03:31:30]  I'm not going to do it.  And then just cheat on her.  So you're probably doing better than I would do.  Good luck, my friend.  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Anthony, you killed me for president.  Yeah.  Let's see.  That was a good improv, by the way.  He said, Anthony, you killed me for president.  I went, yep.  Like I'm from fucking Maine.  Uh, Kenny in Milwaukee needs your expertise as an author.  Okay.  Hey, how you doing, Jim? 
[03:32:00]  Hi, Kenny.  Happy birthday to Uncle Paul.  Isn't he like 58 years younger this month?  57 years young.  So what, are you writing a book?  Well, I actually published it to CreateSpace, which is free for anybody.  It's an Amazon company.  I'm self-published, but I don't know how to get like a traditional publisher.  I don't know what to start.  How do I, who do I send information to, like a copy of the book?  I don't know, because I, I'm sorry, I, to be honest with you, the way it happened for  me is when we were kicked off the radio, I had put some things on my website, um, and 
[03:32:30]  a public, uh, a publicist, no, not a publicist, a book agent noticed it, Lydia.  And she said, Jim's a very funny writer.  He should write a book.  So I started blogging, but we were kicked off the radio with the idea of a book possibly  coming at it.  That eventually became happy ending.  So I kind of backed into it.  So I don't know what the traditional process is to do it.  Call, but you know, you should look up, look up literary agents and call one and ask them, 
[03:33:00]  what do I do?  So I should actually get a radio show and get kicked off and then.  Yes, go through the same thing I did.  Have a tremendously long and assorted sexual history and then write about it.  All right.  Do you mind if I plug my website?  Go ahead.  It's exposingtheloosechange.com.  And I also have a YouTube channel, Lose Change Exposed.  And I have a bunch of videos that have never been proven wrong.  I debunk the conspiracy theory of 9-11.  I debunk it.  Okay. 
[03:33:30]  And I tell you a lot of answers that they cover up and hide and they're lying.  And, uh, my, one of my recent videos is 9-11 Liars Club, Alex Jones.  And I caught him in a lie and it's right there and he cannot deny it.  And I appreciate you taking my call.  Thanks a lot.  All right, buddy.  Good luck with the book.  Take care.  You're getting a lot of calls with people just asking you about coming to different cities  and things like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't, yeah.  If you want me to come to your cities, I love coming to your cities.  And a lot of the times the shows are great.  But when, if shows sell out, like my, my fans might think it's late, but if I'm not going 
[03:34:00]  to sell out, what's the season going?  Like, I mean, I know people mean well when they say that, but I would like to get to your  cities, but you know, I go places where I typically sell okay.  All right.  Let's go to, uh, Sean in Buffalo.  Hi, Sean.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's going on, brother?  Not much.  Hey, um, so, uh, curious about when you're on the road, I know you got a pension for going  ahead and, uh, getting with the ladies and the hookers and stuff.  You ever pull a girl out of the crowd?  I have, but it's, it's, it's very rare that I do. 
[03:34:30]  Um, especially in recent years because after the, uh, shows I sell merchandise and I sign  it and I'm hanging out and then I go back to the hotel with Kenny in between shows and  I come right before I go on.  So I almost never pick off girls after shows anymore at all.  Um, but I have in my life, but it's, it's, it's much more rare than you would think because  my act is not sexy.  You know, it's not a sexy act.  I'm, you know, I'm, again, I talk about happy ending massages and, you know, self-hatred  and all this stuff. 
[03:35:00]  And it's just not the type of thing that makes her go, Oh good.  I want to fuck that fat titted disaster.  Well, the reason why I'm asking is my gal's trying to con me into going to your show out  in Syracuse and when she's a big star fucker and I think she'd make a play for you.  All right.  Well, tell her I'm available.  We'd have to get rid of you though, sir.  So I don't know what we're going to do about that.  Just don't cock block.  That's my advice.  Hey, that's my obligation to you, brother.  See you in Syracuse, buddy.  Thank you.  Later.  Uh, Andrew has an acting question for you, Jim.  Oh good.  He wants to, whatever my answer is, he's going to do the opposite. 
[03:35:30]  Hi, Andrew.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, when you were working in Caldors and Corvettes and wherever the hell you were working,  driving a forklift, what made you think that you could go into standup comedy and be successful?  Cause you, you don't seem like the type of guy that was in the plays and choir and stuff  like that.  It's weird.  It's like I, because I always saw myself as a comedian.  Like from the time I was 12, I always like that was, I've talked before on the show about  this secret fantasy we have about ourselves, which is why people don't try things because  they're not even afraid of failing.  They're afraid of losing that little secret place they go to in their mind where they can 
[03:36:00]  kind of escape and dream about themselves someday.  So people don't try things cause they're afraid of that.  Um, I always kind of saw myself as a comic.  Like when I worked at Caldor when I was 17 or 16, whatever I was, or when I worked at  Pergament and did all these shit jobs, I always believed that someday I would be doing  more.  And a lot of people believe that.  So I deep down probably never really intended to do it.  It's kind of a luck that I, again, backed into this with my friend Larry and I went 
[03:36:30]  to a comedy show and I wound up just doing it.  But, uh, the same low self-esteem that made me need to perform is the same thing that would  have prevented me from attempting it.  It's a really weird thing.  Like I think most comics are low self-esteem people and yet, you know, we're doing the  most arrogant thing.  So I think a lot of times the odds, everything has to line up for you to do it.  That's why a lot of very funny people don't do it because, you know, everything  doesn't line up for them to do it.  But for me, I just, it was, it was the right place at the right time. 
[03:37:00]  And I was dating a girl and I said, fuck it, I'm going to impress her by doing this.  And so I went against being afraid and I risked kind of blowing up that little stupid secret  place I'd go to and tried it.  Um, but that's the only difference between me and somebody who doesn't try it is that  I tried it.  Were you always the funniest guy on the job site and stuff like that?  In, in many ways I was, um, why is that, I think, is that what you're dealing with?  Like people have told you you should be a comedian or you've always dreamed about it, but you're 
[03:37:30]  not too sure what to do it.  You're afraid?  Uh, no, well, I don't know.  Maybe.  It's too late for me.  No, it's not.  Uh, Rodney Dangerfield did comedy for a long time and then he dropped out for years and  went back to aluminum siding and then came back.  And I think he was named Jack Roy.  So it's not too late.  I mean, when you're doing standup, you don't have to realize you, you know, maybe you don't  want to be Seinfeld or fucking, you know, prior, but it doesn't mean you can't go up  and try something that you like. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, he's gone.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Um, you know, just because you're not going to,  you don't think you're, you're young enough to go, you know, to, to Kevin Hart's success  doesn't mean that you can't go up and enjoy it.  Just don't set your goal of becoming an icon.  Just, you know, just go up and do it because you want to do it.  It's fun.  Uh, we'll go to Mark in South Carolina.  Um, this is some new polygamy.  Okay.  Hey, little Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, love you.  Matter of fact, me and one of the wives and one of my sons are, we're actually going to 
[03:38:30]  be in Charlotte on Saturday night to see the world famous Jim Norton.  Well, thank you for coming.  Yes.  Uh, question I do have, I actually, uh, have, uh, three wives, uh, been with one for 17  years, uh, another for seven years and the third for, uh, going on five years.  Wow.  Uh, yeah, uh, big house.  We all get together.  We're all friends.  We're all, I mean, it's not a religious thing. 
[03:39:00]  It's just one of those things that just kind of happen.  How do you get away with polygamy though?  How are you all married?  Well, it's one is one legal marriage and the other two are, were ceremonies done by  friends.  Oh, that's great.  So that way it's not, uh, you know, legally, uh, bigamy.  Okay.  Uh, but it is recognized by our friends and by our families and everything.  Okay.  Uh, the question I do have though is, uh, we've been together and what I do is I actually set 
[03:39:30]  up date nights for each woman where we have time together, uh, then we have time as a  family, but yet some of them, uh, are still getting jealous, uh, of time that I spend doing.  And of course I do want, I do with all, it's like children.  You can't just do for one.  You have to do, uh, for all.  Yeah.  How would you recommend keeping them in line and from being jealous of one of another?  Uh, dude, that's something that's just popped up.  It's a tough question.  Jealousy like that, because they probably weren't raised in a, in a family situation or society 
[03:40:00]  where that was what they were expecting.  Like they, you know, if you're, I guess a Mormon or whatever, you kind of grow up knowing  that that can happen or that's maybe where your adult life is going to wind up.  But it's, if these are women that were not raised in that culture or in a culture of having  that happen, they may think they can handle something that they can't handle.  I mean, I don't know any answer.  How do you make wife one, not be jealous of wife two?  I mean, I don't know what the answer to that is.  I mean, cause it's not like girlfriends where you're casually dating. 
[03:40:30]  The idea of a wife is that you're committed to somebody for a long time.  So they may have trouble cause they're splitting their commitment with other women.  Um, you know what I mean?  They're fully committed to you, but you're not fully committed to them.  So them not being raised in that culture may be hard and that may be insurmountable.  I don't know.  Right.  And it's just, like I said, it's just something that's just kind of popped up over the last  month or two.  Is the woman you're married to, I'm sorry to interrupt you, is the woman you're married  to actually jealous or is it just the other two?  Uh, it's usually the other two. 
[03:41:00]  Well, they're the ones who know they're not the wives.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  They're basically, they're just basically living in a, in a, they're there, they have  no legal right to anything you own.  So everything you, all you buy or that you get as a group could probably go to your actual  legal wife and these other two will have no claim on it.  So it's almost like they're working for a company that they're never going to own stock  in.  Right.  And for women that, you know, because again, they have a clock that's different than ours.  That's probably starts to play in if they get into their thirties or whatever. 
[03:41:30]  They're like, all right, what if I have a kid with him or, you know, whatever it is.  They're thinking maybe, maybe that goes into it because they don't have a legal claim to  anything.  At least that one woman knows that she has, you know, she's your partner and she's entitled  to half, you know, maybe they know that they have no claim to anything.  All right.  Well, never thought of it that way.  All right.  Anything you would suggest?  No, I would just suggest to tell them like if they can't handle it, that they, and again,  say it nicely, but maybe that they should move on as hard as that would be because 
[03:42:00]  you don't need, if there's three of you living together, you don't need one or two of you  jealous and become, because then it's going to become fucking undercutting and people  are going to start, you know, pitting one against the other and, you know, who the fuck  needs that at home?  Right.  Right.  So I would just have, I would suggest an honest discussion with them and tell them to really  be truthful about what it is they want and what it is they can handle.  And if they can't handle it, they have to be willing to walk and you have to be willing  to let them go without making some kind of false promise.  True.  True that.  Good luck, buddy.  Okay, cool beans.  Well, listen, Jimmy, I cannot wait until Saturday and you're going to have fun and so are we. 
[03:42:30]  Thank you, man.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Bring the hottest wife.  Okay.  Who's next?  Let's go to Jess in New York City.  Hi, Jess.  Hey, Jim.  How's it going?  I'm good, buddy.  How are you?  Hey, I'm a truck driver and I've recently become obsessed with escorts.  Yes.  I'm a comedian and I have a long time ago been obsessed with them, so I get it.  Yeah, and I don't make a lot of money and it's kind of getting out of hand. 
[03:43:00]  Have you ever heard of erotic mugshots.com?  I have not.  Yeah, because you can see the pictures of the girls and then you can call them directly.  You don't have to go through anyone.  I travel around all around the country and I'm in all these different cities and as long  as I'm in a major city, I can just go on the internet and just call a girl up and I can  either get a room or she'll come to my truck and it's really become an obsession. 
[03:43:30]  At this case, I'm probably spending $5,000, $6,000 a year because it's $200, $300 a shot  and I'm doing it like twice a month at least.  Well, I can tell you this, sir.  It's like gambling or any other addiction.  Like, money is all relative to what you make.  Like, there's people that gamble, you know, $100,000 a week away.  And for you, if $1,000 a month is hurting you, then you should look at it.  Because the internet, dude, the internet for us is a new toy.  Like, how old a guy are you? 
[03:44:00]  I'm 50.  See, in our generation, we didn't grow up with that.  So for younger people, it's one thing.  They may be used to it.  But for guys like us who didn't grow up with it, it's this newfound access to everything.  Like, you know, we didn't have girls.  You couldn't just, if I was performing stand-up in 1992, I couldn't just find a girl on a fucking magic device.  You have a magic device that you can call a girl and she'll fuck you.  I mean, how does anybody resist that?  It's very hard to resist.  So sexual addiction has been completely sped up by the internet because we don't know how to handle it yet. 
[03:44:30]  It's something that will eventually work itself out, but it's really hard to balance.  I understand it.  It's like this thing that you look forward to.  Like, ooh, I'm going to be in Detroit.  Now, fuck that one with the great tits is in Detroit.  It becomes this thing to look forward to.  Whereas 20 years ago, it might have been a restaurant or a hotel or whatever it is.  So, like anything else, man, if it's getting out of hand, you should address it and do something about it because it's never just going to go away on its own. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, because it's great because, I mean, you can get a 23-year-old girl, come to you.  I mean, those young girls are, oh, my God.  Yeah.  I mean, I had a girl come to Chucky the other night.  I was in St. Louis.  I mean, she fucked me raw, sucked me.  I did everything to her, man.  It was awesome.  Of course it's awesome.  And the thing, the decision you make is sometimes I'll think, okay, what's worse?  Because if you're out just banging girls randomly, A, you're putting in hours and hours of time. 
[03:45:30]  Because if you want to meet girls in different places, there's nothing wrong with that.  But you're going to have to be online.  An instant message is going to cost you hours of time.  You never know if they're married, if they have some boyfriend that's going to show up at your truck with a fucking hammer.  You might get them pregnant, and all of a sudden you're tied into them for 21 years.  So sometimes just spending a little bit of money is a cheaper option in the long run.  But if you feel it's making your life unmanageable and it's becoming something you shouldn't be doing anymore,  well, then you might want to address it by either going to some kind of a meeting or a therapy. 
[03:46:00]  Because that's the only thing I can think of that works for those things.  Yeah.  I can tell it's an obsession, man.  I mean, I'm lonely, and I just want a woman.  Yeah.  Maybe you should find a girl, dude.  Maybe try a dating site, too.  Match.com or something like that.  Maybe you could try a healthier one, too.  That's not going to guarantee you a fuck.  But when you get into these cities, you'll go to dinner.  Why don't you try that, too?  Okay.  You know what I mean?  And if it doesn't work out, but I hear good things about a lot of those sites that they actually will help you. 
[03:46:30]  And you can meet real people on them.  So maybe you want to try one of those and give it a shot.  Okay.  Thanks, Jim.  Good luck, buddy.  Thanks.  All right.  Yeah, and always make sure you shave before a date.  It's tempting to be slovenly and sloppy.  But, I mean, you want to shave.  And what's worse?  You're all lathered up.  And what's worse than being ready to shave?  And you realize you forgot to buy blades.  Don't you feel like a douche when that happens?  I know I do.  Now you're stuck digging through the trash for an old blade that zombied out your face yesterday. 
[03:47:00]  And now you've got to reuse it.  You're one step away from stealing your wife's lady razor.  And that's just humiliating on a man's level.  You never want to take a pink razor that she shaves her fat legs with or her cankles.  You really want to shave your face with the same thing your wife shaves her cankles with?  This is your Dollar Shave Club moment, you silly geese.  Dollar Shave Club is for guys who routinely forget to buy or simply hate shelling out for blades.  So here's what all the Dollar Shave Club buzz is about.  Everyone buys razor blades, right? 
[03:47:30]  We have to.  Unless you've had your face lasered.  And that's just stupid if you're a man.  Brand name razor companies nail you.  They build them with 10 blades, a vibrating handle, and a built-in back scratcher.  It's idiotic and it's too expensive.  You end up paying up the wazoo for them.  I like that.  That's written in real man language because that's how real guys talk.  We say up the wazoo.  Sounds conversational.  But you do get it.  They're basically saying they fuck you financially.  And they do.  Dollar Shave Club does not. 
[03:48:00]  They say stop overpaying for shave technology that you don't need.  The Dollar Shave Club, you send them a couple bucks a month and they deliver great quality razor blades right to your door.  You save a fortune and plus you always have fresh blades on hand because they're not going to forget to deliver them.  They're not idiots like you and me.  I forget to buy them all the time and I have to go out and get them and it's just expensive and stupid.  So join the Opie and Anthony show listeners who have already found the smarter way to shave at DollarShaveClub.com.  DollarShaveClub.com.  It is, they say it again, DollarShaveClub.com. 
[03:48:30]  Stop paying up the wazoo.  That's regular guy talk because that's how we all talk around the water cooler.  Harry, where'd you get those razors?  Oh, gee, Bill, I spent up the wazoo for them.  Who's next on this fine program?  Rich in Yonkers had a quick question about the Patrice benefit for us.  Okay, yes.  Hi, Rich.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you, buddy?  Good, thank you.  How are you?  Good, thank you.  How are you?  Turn your radio down.  Turn your radio down, Rich, please.  My radio is off, actually. 
[03:49:00]  Okay, whatever that echo is.  Okay.  I'm throwing off the Bluetooth.  Okay.  I wanted to ask you, is that Patrice benefit because I wasn't able to make it?  Is that ever going to be available on DVD or on...  No, it was not filmed, it was not recorded, it was just a one and done, you know, for  the family and the posters are still available, I think.  You could probably grab some of them on eBay, but no, that was it, buddy.  It was just that one night.  Oh, too bad.  All right.  Well, thank you anyway.  Okay, brother.  Take care.  Let's go to Justin, Kentucky.  Hi, Justin. 
[03:49:30]  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up?  I'm good, buddy.  How are you?  Nah, not too bad.  A quick question, man.  I'm kind of backwards.  I mean, I'm a younger dude.  I'm actually recently going through a divorce.  How old are you?  I'm 26.  Okay.  Yeah, I drive a truck, but I'm not one of those guys that are, like, gone constantly.  Like, I'm home five nights out of seven.  Okay.  But anyway, I'm recently divorced, and I just, like, what do you do to meet women?  Like, new people in general, because where I'm at, like, there's no bars, there's no night  clubs, there's like a fucking Walmart, and that's it. 
[03:50:00]  You know, I'll tell you, man, this is where the crazy age of the internet, which we just  talked about, the other guy with the sex addiction, there really are plenty of websites  to go to.  I mean, because I'm not a nightclub guy myself.  I mean, I work on them, and I still have trouble meeting women, and I don't say that  like you should be shocked, but I mean, I'm exposed to different people every night.  I'm exposed to different women every night, and it's difficult.  So even if you do go out to bars and clubs, you're spending hours and hours and hours, 
[03:50:30]  and if you're looking for, like, a relationship, and you're not just looking to fuck, there  are websites, and I'm not shilling from F.com.  I have no experience with them whatsoever.  I don't know anything about them other than the fact that I have heard people, like, or  J-Date or any of these things, where you put up a real picture, and you look at profiles,  and you answer, and it might cost you some money, but again, dude, you're not going to  go out into a bar and drink for free.  You're not going to go out and buy a woman drinks all night just to get no phone number  for free.  So I would suggest, check all these sites out, see which one kind of appeals to you, and 
[03:51:00]  give it a shot, because it seems like that's what people are doing now, is it saves you  a lot of trouble.  It saves you drunk driving.  It saves you hours of beer breath and standing, you know, so give it a shot online.  I've tried online before.  I just really never had luck with the website, because it seems like it's more of a pain in  the ass to manage.  Maybe it is, but I mean, again, the option of live things, where do people go to meet  women?  I guess they go to social functions or bars or clubs.  I mean, I just don't know, brother.  Because I don't, even in comedy clubs, it's hard for me to meet women. 
[03:51:30]  So without stand-up comedy, I would probably be in a monastery somewhere.  I would have no ability whatsoever to get free pussy.  Well, before, I mean, the only way that I would ever meet women was when I was either  in college classes or at work.  And now, I mean, I don't go to college, and I fucking drive a truck by myself.  So there's no social aspect whatsoever unless I fucking drive an hour away from home.  Well, be lucky.  Again, then look at this.  The age of the internet, you are lucky that there is an option. 
[03:52:00]  That does work.  I mean, maybe for you it's been a pain in the ass, but it's a possibility.  So in that way, we are very fortunate.  Yeah, it exacerbates sexual addiction and all that stuff, but it's a really great thing  to be able to go out and put up dating profiles.  You could probably do it for free on Craigslist.  I mean, you have to weed through a lot of prostitutes, but there is like a men-seeking women section  where I think a lot of them are legit.  So there are ways to do it online.  It may be time-consuming, and it may not always work, but again, there's nothing you're  going to do in your truck unless you're on the CB, so you might as well give it a shot. 
[03:52:30]  Except that something is better than nothing, pretty much.  Yeah, of course, dude.  At least we have the option now.  Exactly.  All right?  Appreciate it, brother.  All right, brother.  See you.  See you.  Jason in Detroit has an issue with his parents.  Okay.  Hi, Jason.  Hey, Jimmy.  I haven't talked to my mother or my father in six years.  I had an altercation with my brother, and I went to my parents to kind of like, you  know, kind of make some peace between us, and my parents both said, well, you're 
[03:53:00]  an adult, why don't you fucking handle it?  How old are you, and how old is your brother?  Well, I'm 41 now, and he's two years older than me.  That was six years ago.  Okay, so you're adults.  I mean, I'm an adult, but I was like, you know, let's have a mediator instead of me,  because when I went to him to confront the situation, he wanted to take it physical, and  I'm much larger than my brother, even though he's older, and it wouldn't have ended well,  because I have a temper.  Sure, sure.  In our family, we're not for a temper, and so I was just trying to do things peacefully, 
[03:53:30]  and I've had other issues with my parents growing up, abuse and stuff like that, so  I haven't talked to him in a long time, short, long story short, my father is very ill, and  my one sister who I still talk to, and my wife kind of want me to go visit him, and I  keep telling them no, and they're kind of not letting it drop.  Well, a couple things, dude.  Again, I don't know your family dynamics, but I do in a way, and I'm not saying your parents  are good people or awful people, but there is something to be said for the fact that when 
[03:54:00]  two adults are having a disagreement like you and your brother, maybe parents get sick  and tired of being mediators.  Again, I'm not a parent, but maybe that was part of the issue, and I do think it's up  to you and your brother to handle it without a mediator.  I think if you guys have issues, especially if you've said you've had issues with your  parents and they were abuse and stuff like that, then maybe you shouldn't be going to  them to mediate for you as an adult.  Maybe whatever problem you and your brother has, as two men, you have to work that out as 
[03:54:30]  adults, and just because people are our parents doesn't mean we have to like them.  So, you have to make a decision.  Will you be able to forgive yourself if you never see your father again?  And you have to really know that, because, you know, my dad told me that he had an argument  with his grandfather.  They were very close, but the last time he ever saw his grandfather, I think they had  an argument.  And, you know, unfortunately, a good relationship, that last bad moment was the final memory.  So, for you, maybe there wasn't a great relationship. 
[03:55:00]  Are you willing to never see him again for real?  Like, this is not a dress rehearsal.  This is, like, you understand that you will really never see him again.  I understand that, and I've said that since day one, because I went to my parents.  I could have handled it, and I tried to handle it with my brother, but he didn't want to listen.  It was just his side.  I was just trying to kind of talk to him like an adult.  And any time I bring something off, trying to counteract his point, he wanted to take 
[03:55:30]  it physical.  And like I said, if I would have took it physical, I'm 6'7", I weigh 280 pounds, and I'm not  a fat guy.  Right, right, right.  I'm a little bit bigger than Kenny, because I actually saw you down in Columbus.  Okay.  And my brother's about 6 foot, he's got about 200 pounds.  So it would have ended well.  And I was just like, I don't want to hurt him.  Sure.  Because I know how I would get, and I try to be a adult about it, and I figure, you  know, I was just trying to, let's all be adults about it, let's talk this thing over.  What was the problem? 
[03:56:00]  What was the problem that you two are strange?  You haven't talked to him in six years either, right?  No.  If I ever saw him again, I would probably punch him.  He accused my wife of saying something disrespectful to his son, and I've since talked to his son.  Me and his son actually get along great.  He doesn't get along with his father.  And I asked his son about the situation.  I actually asked his mother about the situation, because they're divorced.  My brother's divorced from his first wife, and she goes, she doesn't recall the situation.  What happened was, my brother was cheating on his wife, and my wife found out about it, 
[03:56:30]  and I think that he was using that as a reason to kind of separate himself from my wife and  me.  Did the wife tell his son?  No.  Okay.  My wife swears up and down, and I believe her.  What did the son say when you asked him?  Son said, I don't know what ever happened, because I always wondered why I never saw you.  I'm his godfather, too.  So, you know, I've talked to his son a lot, and I'm pretty close to him. 
[03:57:00]  Well, there's an old expression, to my own self be true.  If you know, deep down, that you definitely don't want to see your father again, and you  know your reasons are right, and your motives are clear, and you're comfortable with that,  and you don't feel a need to do it for your sister and her peace of mind or your mother,  then don't do it.  And again, just make sure you have a clear head and you're not reacting angrily, because  anger does fade, and there's certain things that are undoable. 
[03:57:30]  And if what you're saying is accurate, and your brother's just being a prick who doesn't  want to listen, well, sometimes, you know, we can only make so much effort.  But if you're estranged from your mother and your father and your brother, you know,  you're the common denominator in that.  So maybe the three of them are fucked up, or maybe you're not processing something well  either.  Don't forget, dude, you are a quarter of that foursome, so there might be something you're  not doing right, too.  His phone cut out.  Oh, okay, so we didn't hang up on you.  Yeah.  We got disconnected.  Sorry, man, I hope you're still listening.  So good luck with whatever happens, and don't punch him. 
[03:58:00]  You're a big boy.  Let's go to Mike in Trenton.  He has a problem with his engagement.  Okay, hi, Mike.  Hey, how you doing, Jimmy?  Good, buddy.  I'm going to give you a little backstory before I get to my question.  I've been with my wife for 13 years now, been married for high school sweethearts, lost  my virginity to her.  For the first time a few weeks ago, I went to a strip club and, you know, got to dances, 
[03:58:30]  finally see the one that was just my type.  Yeah.  I got to get to dances, great time, starts giving me free dances, and I was there until  closing, and she says, why don't you wait up for me afterwards?  So I wait up.  I was drinking all night, wait up.  She tells me that her car's broke down, she just needs a ride home. 
[03:59:00]  Okay, fine.  So we start heading towards her place, and she has to pull over, she has to snort a Xanax.  Okay.  While she did that, we got to talking, we talked about this and that, and then she just  hops on board, and I've been truthful with my wife.  I've never been to Sonic.  We've had a great relationship.  And after we fucked, it was great. 
[03:59:30]  We just hung out in my car for a long time.  We ended up going out to breakfast.  She wanted to give me her number afterwards.  And basically what my question is, is should I jump down this rabbit hole?  No, no.  Do you think your lack of long-term relationships is because it directly contributes because  of your likeness? 
[04:00:00]  Absolutely.  Here's why I say no.  Because if you've been faithful to your wife and you've been good, again, I don't want to  get married or whatever, but I admire people who do it and enjoy it.  It's not like you and your wife are such a terrible couple, and then you met this girl.  This is a girl, this is only going to end badly.  She's, this dancer, and she might be a great girl, but she's much more used to this than  you are.  You know what I mean?  She probably doesn't have a husband at home, so she's risky. 
[04:00:30]  When someone pulls over the first time you're with them and they snort a Xanax, that should  tell you it's not going to end well.  You do not want to get involved in this because she's going to be with other guys.  There's no way you're going to be in some committed relationship with her.  So she's going to be dancing.  You're going to show up at the strip club.  She's going to have some guy pumping hundreds into her, and she's not going to want to hang  with you because she's going to be making her living.  So you're going to get jealous and fucked up.  Even if she doesn't leave with him, the fact that she's going into the back with him and  you're going to want free dances because you guys have a weird connection. 
[04:01:00]  That's a fucking, I'm telling you, you're setting yourself up to be very, very unhappy  if you do that.  And I understand the temptation.  I would personally not go back.  At all.  I mean, that's the other thing is I've never really been to a strip club until that time.  And, you know, even, you know, I am not an idiot.  I know I'm not going to save this girl.  I'm not going to.  But even going back to the strip club and just getting more lapsed into it, I've always  been kind of like a closet case pervert where I've been on probably every foreign website 
[04:01:30]  known.  And, you know, it's like my wife doesn't really know that.  Right.  But we have a great relationship.  We do everything under the sun that we could possibly do together.  And, you know, it's just...  You're going to wreck the marriage.  Because I'm telling you, like you said, a great way to put it, it's a rabbit hole.  And because it's a strip club, this is what strippers do.  And I think she probably genuinely likes her.  She wouldn't have fucked you for free.  But who knows, man?  You never know what's going on in their head. 
[04:02:00]  They're flaky.  They change from day to day.  They get a new boyfriend or a new sugar daddy because you're married and you're not pumping  money into her.  It's only going to end badly.  Again, she pulled over and was snorting a Xanax.  That should tell you something.  That should tell you something.  This is not her first day at the fucking rodeo, as we like to say.  You have a lot more to risk than she does.  I would stay away.  I understand the temptation of it.  Personally, I think that you should be telling your wife whatever it is you jerk off to.  Not the stripper story. 
[04:02:30]  But I don't think you should be hiding what you jerk off to from your wife.  You know, hopefully in a relationship, you can fuck her while looking at the images you  want to look at.  Or she can tell you what her secret dirt is.  And that's kind of healthy.  But I don't...  It's my taste.  It's my taste that have changed.  It's like, when we were first together in high school, my taste was her.  But now it's become...  It's evolved into just...  I mean, she's still fucking super attractive.  Sure.  And, you know, petite, thin, amazing person.  But, you know, it's like, I want that taste of dirtiness. 
[04:03:00]  It's a high.  Yeah, of course, dude.  I get it.  It's great.  It's a high.  Believe me, I've lost some weight recently.  I want to eat cheesecake every day.  I want to shove food into my fucking fat face every day.  Sometimes, and it's really hard to do.  We just got to tell ourselves no.  Because it's not worth the trade-off.  And again, that's me saying it.  And I've destroyed so many things with sexual addiction.  So many great opportunities with women.  And so many wonderful people and relationships that I have fucked up. 
[04:03:30]  And I've been emotionally distant from.  And you're going to do that to the person you love the most.  I've never even been married and I've done that.  So, I don't think you want to wreck your wife's life and your life over a girl who snorts Xanax the first time you hang out with her.  And believe me, she will fuck you over.  She absolutely, you'll walk in that club one night and you'll see her giving another guy the same look as you.  And she'll wink at you in a sexy way and they take him into the back room and you're going to be humiliated. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah.  And you set yourself up for a disaster.  All right, so stay away.  Yeah, man, it's hard.  You got lucky.  See, no one fucks a stripper their first time in a strip club.  No one.  Here's what happened.  Someone got injured.  You got called up for the minor leagues.  You went to bunt and the ball went over the fence.  That's never going to happen again.  You bunted a three-run home run your first time up at the plate.  Just enjoy it, dude.  And be happy that you got lucky that one time.  And realize that does not happen in strip clubs.  And just enjoy that memory.  All right, thanks, Jimmy.  You killed it at the Patrice's benefit. 
[04:04:30]  Thank you, buddy.  Later.  All right.  We have time for one more.  We are out of time.  Let's just say this.  I should have asked him if he had oral sex.  Do you love oral sex?
