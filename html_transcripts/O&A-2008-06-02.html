<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcasting live from WBCN studios in Boston, opened with a recounting of their frustrating encounters with Stone Temple Pilots.  The band repeatedly cancelled interviews and significantly delayed their concert, causing near-riots and backstage chaos involving Scott Weiland, the DeLeo brothers, and Weiland's girlfriend.  Accusations of unprofessionalism and arguments ensued.  The hosts then detailed their train journey to Boston, sharing anecdotes about a flirtatious older woman and a man Kenny danced with, alongside microphone mishaps.

Anthony's new relationship with traffic reporter Jill Nicolini dominated much of the broadcast.  They discussed their relationship extensively, including her missed workdays, her popularity with listeners, her impressive luggage (over 100 pounds for a 24-hour trip), and her elaborate Starbucks order.  This included repeated references to their affectionate behavior on the train, causing discomfort to a fellow passenger.  They officially announced their status as boyfriend and girlfriend, revealing details of their courtship, including pet names and gifts (roses with a love note).  Their singing together, plans for a Nashville trip, an upcoming "Sex and the City" movie outing, and a "Long Island Royalty" mixtape featuring their sing-along were all mentioned.

The show also touched upon the poor box office performance of a movie (implied to lack male appeal), a man's unusual reason for attending a shoe exhibition ("shoes and pretty women"), and a listener's conspiracy theory about Opie and Anthony's relationship with Jill.  Political discussions included the 2008 Democratic primaries, focusing on Hillary Clinton's struggles and controversies surrounding Barack Obama's church.  Racially charged comments from a Clinton supporter and a critical sermon were played, sparking conversation about race and political rhetoric.  Other segments included discussion of an alleged alien video and a humorous anecdote about a child's mispronunciation in a spelling bee.

A significant portion focused on Jimmy, a colleague, trying on one of Jill's dresses, generating humorous descriptions and jokes about men wearing dresses and panties.  The hosts also discussed the Boston Celtics-Los Angeles Lakers NBA Finals, Manny Ramirez's 500th home run, a reconciliation with Robin Quivers, a graphic injury in a Kimbo Slice MMA fight shown on CBS, Ted Kennedy's upcoming brain surgery, and the death of a comedian friend from a brain tumor.  The show featured frequent crude and sexually suggestive humor, with Kenny and Keith, part of the show's crew, actively participating.  Bill Burr's advertisement was also aired.  Finally,  "Opi's Eye" segment featuring photos from their trip was announced.  The entire broadcast was characterized by a fast-paced, rambling style, jumping between numerous topics and punctuated with frequent comedic asides and banter.

[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?

Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  We were number one across the board with men in morning drive radio here in New York City.  Yeah.  We're doing better.  In men, we were number one.  And in women, we crept up to number 375.  Ah!  So I went to the action park trip, and this fine Chinese doctor popped about 20 needles  on me.  Would you take a needle?  What do you need curing, besides your alcoholism? 
[00:01:00]  What's up, Anthony?  Is the date officially over?  Uh, no.  Do you need help?  I should be being held hostage.  No, you.  Yes.  I'm a hostage of love.  Oh, God.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Are we on?  Checking, checking, checking. 
[00:01:30]  Of course we are.  How does that sound?  I don't know.  It's what it is.  Like a million bucks.  What you're used to.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What's the matter?  You gotta be real close?  Yeah.  I gotta be extremely close to this microphone.  Unless I'm doing something wrong. 
[00:02:00]  Am I talking into the right side of this thing?  We are live from Boston in the WBCN studio.  If I have to do the whole show like this.  Smashing the mic into your face.  Oh, my God.  Is this really how I have to do the radio show?  I can't move my head.  What, Jimmy?  Oh, Jimmy, that isn't the way it works.  No?  No, you gotta talk into the front of it.  I don't wanna. 
[00:02:30]  You gotta talk into the front of it.  What year is it?  I know.  Is this better?  Yeah, that's better for you.  It's good.  Truman won, by the way.  You have to put up mics.  Oh, my.  Look.  Can you move back a little bit?  Probably not.  Gotta just shove your face right onto the mic.  Oh, my God.  Did they change the microphone since the last time we were in Boston?  I'm thinking they did.  Roll up some silly putty and put it across the bridge of your nose so it feels like a war helmet.  Wow. 
[00:03:00]  Well, you really gotta have this in your face, don't you?  It's kinda awkward.  I don't want this big black thing right in front of my face like this.  It's kinda creepy.  It is, right?  Yeah.  Alright.  Well, yes, we are live in Boston.  Since the last time we talked to you guys, we saw Stone Temple Pilots twice.  Yep.  We were on a choo-choo train.  We slept in a hotel room for maybe four hours.  At most.  The fine folks here in Boston gave us a great suite at a really nice hotel. 
[00:03:30]  We saw the suite for what?  Four hours?  Four and a half hours?  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  That was it.  It wasn't even like you could go back after the show maybe and catch a snooze.  Pack all your stuff when you leave for the studio.  Yeah.  So we had to just, it was like fleeing.  We're on the lam.  We've been on the lam for two days.  And for what reason?  We're still trying to figure it out.  Yeah.  I mean, we love coming up to Boston, but we would like to come up to Boston and actually  see Boston. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, that would be nice.  We usually don't.  We see the studio.  No.  Maybe a venue of some sort.  And then a hotel room for ten minutes.  And then do the radio show and then leave immediately, because everything has to be immediate  with us.  I don't really understand that.  The show's over.  We have 15 minutes to get to the train station.  Going back to New York.  Hurry up.  We're going to be late.  To rush home to do what?  Nothing.  Exactly.  Why couldn't we hang here for two days? 
[00:04:30]  I love Boston.  I would love to be here another day.  I saw that hotel room last night, and I wanted to buy a Stone Temple Pilots record and break  it, because I missed the hotel all day to get blown off by that band.  I was so irritated yesterday.  You were irritated, right?  I was like cranky.  When we were doing interviews yesterday, not interviews, we were hanging out on the air  up here in Boston on WBCN, and I commented that it's such a douchey move by bands. 
[00:05:00]  But obviously they had the river rave up here, and the headliner was Stone Temple Pilots.  And then it comes down to interviewing Stone Temple Pilots, and they blew us off.  Of course.  And we all knew they were going to blow us off, because on the train, Kenny's like,  and you got an interview with Stone Temple Pilots at 730.  Like, sure, that's going to happen.  I didn't even prepare, because I knew we weren't going to be talking to Stone Temple Pilots.  Of course not.  And then, so they blow off any acknowledgement that Boston, this fine radio station, brought 
[00:05:30]  them to Boston.  And then it comes time for them to hit the stage.  And next thing you know, the BCN backstage passes aren't good anymore.  The band has decided anyone with a BCN pass needs to flee the area.  Get out.  And go back into catering.  Yeah.  The whole reason they're in Boston was because of what this station did.  Yeah.  Bringing them to town.  So Jimmy was completely annoyed.  He's like, I'll be in the limo.  And he just left. 
[00:06:00]  I didn't want to see, look, I don't want to trash them, because BCN brought them up there.  I didn't want to see that prima donna sissy walk.  I don't care if they dragged them out of the truck under a sheet.  I didn't want to look at them.  I hate musicians.  I hate them.  Comics are easy.  Here's 10 of you.  Here's a sandwich.  You're going on in a little while.  Yeah.  We're just happy to be there.  I hate musicians.  Look, I love STP.  They're one of my favorite bands of all time.  But wow, we saw some things in the last two days.  I mean, Scott Weiland's taking this whole rock star thing a bit seriously. 
[00:06:30]  Is she?  Clear the area.  Really, Joan Crawford?  Do you want to sashay through alone?  Oh, you old sissy.  He really bothered me.  All right.  Terrific.  Well, on Saturday night at the PNC, I mean, you know, we could finally tell the folks what  happened, because we were down there for the K-Rock version of this show, and man, people  were getting a bit antsy. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, a bit?  A bit antsy at the PNC Arts Center in Homedale, New Jersey.  We got on stage and told the fine folks that STP was going to be out in mere minutes.  Two minutes.  Yeah.  Two minutes to STP.  And that was right after Filter?  Hang out.  Yeah.  Filter, just amazing.  Richard Patrick, just an amazing vocalist.  And man, they did a great job.  Yeah, then Stone Temple Pilots, two minutes later, we walk off stage, and because I love 
[00:07:30]  the band so much, I ran into my seats.  I'm like, I got to check this out.  And an hour and easily 15 minutes later, there's still no band.  The booing's getting louder at the PNC Arts Center?  Yeah.  One of the security people that works for the venue goes, we are heading toward a riot.  We are heading toward a riot.  He openly said, this is not a good situation.  And what's the reason?  Do they think it's cool to make the crowd that paid good money sit there for an hour and 
[00:08:00]  a half?  I hate them.  And just wait after they've cut off the beer supply.  So now you're just sitting there.  You're starting to get a hangover because you stopped drinking.  And you're just getting all rambunctious.  Yeah.  Is that a good idea?  Do they sit there and just go, this is great.  Let's just completely annoy our audience.  Well, I mean, that's a good question because I looked at Kenny. 
[00:08:30]  Kenny was sitting with us and I said, Kenny, let's go backstage.  Something's up.  So we run back to the backstage area just in time to see some S going down.  Some fireworks.  Some fireworks.  Where is Kenny?  He's got to help me through this story.  If you can find a microphone that works.  Okay.  Wait a minute here, GA.  I don't know how to turn that on.  Hold on.  Wait, let me ask you a question.  Let me try this.  Yeah.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Were the K-Rock passes still good back then?  I guess.  I don't know.  Okay. 
[00:09:00]  So I might have seen what happened.  All right.  Why?  What happened?  No, you guys tell the story.  Oh, right.  Let's just say that there are certain things that happened at K-Rock that got reported at  BCN.  Maybe the band didn't want BCN people around.  I have to see some more shenanigans.  Yeah, could be it.  Yeah, but I mean, I was thinking about that, but isn't this kind of cool for the band?  Sure.  The story I told up here yesterday?  Probably not.  Why not?  They're rock stars.  This helps you out down the road. 
[00:09:30]  Conflict?  Ah, whatever.  So we go backstage just in time to see one of the DeLeo brothers pointing at, there were  two tour buses backstage at the PNC, and one of the DeLeo brothers, all set and ready  to go on stage.  You know, they were supposed to be on an hour and 15 minutes ago.  So he's pointing at this tour bus and going, come on out, Axel!  Come on, Axel!  Screaming, come on out, Axel!  Well, he was pulling an axle.  And it was Scott Weiland in his own tour bus. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And there was a huge monster of a human being standing right in front of the entrance to  the tour bus, not allowing the DeLeo brother, one of the DeLeo brothers, to board the bus  of his bandmate.  That would have been a brawl.  There would have been a brawl.  And, uh, is that right, Kenny?  That's what we saw?  Yes.  Yeah, you have to, like, get...  Yes! 
[00:10:30]  I still can't hear you.  Pretend it's a perp you're trying to be polite to.  Huh?  You said it was 2-3-4, no?  God, uh...  3-4.  Yeah, so it was 4.  We're all counting in the studio.  2-3-4.  It should be working, but I don't know.  Okay, Kenny.  Good morning, is this working?  Sort of.  No, it's not.  Get really close.  Well, my big nose is touching it.  Yeah, I think it's just being picked up on the other mics.  Can I try this one?  Yeah, go over there.  Danny, talk into that one.  Hello?  Yeah, that's good.  See, that's 4. 
[00:11:00]  I'm 4.  Kenny, 5.  Huh?  That might be 1.  Someone told me it goes 1-2-3-4, but I think it goes 1-2-3-4 that way.  You're talking into the bottom of it.  Kenny, aim it down.  There you go.  Now twist it around.  No, the other way.  There you go.  Now talk right into it.  There you go.  Yeah, we were like I Spy.  Oh, my God.  That was so loud.  We were like I Spy backstage.  Yeah.  With all the mystery and intrigue. 
[00:11:30]  So, yeah, one of the DeLeo brothers pointing at the bus and screaming,  come on out, Axl.  You know, because Scott Weiland wasn't ready to hit the stage yet.  The bass player.  All right.  I was just saying one of the DeLeo brothers.  That's fine.  And then there was a girl outside the bus.  I don't know what kind of connection she had to Scott Weiland,  but this same DeLeo brother called her the C-word and said,  get off my effing tour, you bitch.  And then you, get off my effing tour. 
[00:12:00]  I don't want you on this tour.  And then he started screaming because the DeLeo brothers are from Jersey.  They're saying, I can't believe he's going to do this in my effing hometown.  My effing hometown.  Come on, Axl.  Come on.  Screaming, losing his mind.  Next thing you know, the tour bus opens and Scott Weiland walks out  looking like Weekend at Bernie.  He's just like, what's up?  I'm ready to go. 
[00:12:30]  All decked out in his rock and roll attire.  Right, Kenny?  You know, a white jacket, a big pimp hat.  Huge oversized glasses.  Yeah, and he was more wobbling.  Yeah, was he wobbly getting off the bus?  Big time.  And then he wobbles to the backstage area.  Yep.  And now this is at 10.30.  Filter got off around 9.15.  And the curfew for the PNC is at 11 o'clock.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden he's backstage.  And now his woman's getting into it with DeLeo because now she's hanging with Scott Weiland. 
[00:13:00]  And goes, he called me a C.  He called me a C.  And then DeLeo right in front of him.  Weiland's like, I want you off this effing tour.  And then DeLeo gets like literally a couple inches from Scott Weiland's face and goes,  Can you even do the show, man?  Can you do the show?  And then Weiland either nodded or said something.  We didn't hear that, right?  I think he just like lit a cigarette and walked away.  He didn't even acknowledge them.  And then all of a sudden he just starts walking to the left side of the stage. 
[00:13:30]  The DeLeo brother walked to the right side of the stage.  And then if you were in the audience, literally after this whole commotion that went down backstage,  they were playing their first song a mere couple minutes later.  Like nothing happened.  Wow.  And he was really slow on that stage in Jersey.  I've seen Stone Temple Pilots a lot.  He was a bit slow.  A bit lethargic.  Well, they must not have been doing the old, let's get together and I'll sing and you play. 
[00:14:00]  And I'll put my head on your shoulder.  No, none of that.  This is an Opie and Anthony exclusive report.  You won't hear this on TMZ.  You only hear this info on Opie and Anthony.  Hopefully you won't even hear it on the replay with that in it.  Yeah, we'll cut that out.  But they sounded great in Jersey.  And then last night they hit the stage on time.  And I got to say it, they were way better last night. 
[00:14:30]  Way better.  What we saw before we had to be whisked away to our hotel room.  Yeah, I just wanted out of there at that point.  So we could get a few hours sleep before the broadcast is in there for hours.  What happened?  Do you think that Weiland's gynecological exam was a little better the second night than the first night?  Jimmy, you're annoyed, right?  I'm lying.  He has a vagina.  Just disgusted.  I'm disgusted.  I don't like musicians to begin with most of the time.  I think they're prima donnas and most of them are coddled sissies.  I don't like, like they had a meet and greet for the fans. 
[00:15:00]  People that won contests at BCN and then the lead singer doesn't show up.  It's like, what are you doing, man?  He wasn't even at the venue.  No.  You know, that was the rumor last night.  Is he even going to show tonight?  We don't even know if he's going to show.  And after hanging backstage for the last two days for this concert, it's very obvious to me  that Weiland's not associating with anyone in the band.  He's doing his own thing, showing up just in time to sing the great songs that the Stone Temple Pilots have. 
[00:15:30]  So, it was very interesting the last couple of days.  So, he's a douche.  Yep.  I still love their music, but he's definitely playing the rock and roll star.  Yeah.  Definitely playing it.  And I wanted to be backstage to see what kind of shape he was in as he, you know, got off the bus.  And Jimmy's like, oh, I'm out of here.  I couldn't hear that the band wants the backstage area cleared. 
[00:16:00]  Really?  Of what, the station that sponsored them?  Yeah.  For what?  Why?  Because their babies can't walk past them.  It's not like everybody was on stage.  We're backstage.  And they would have walked through.  You might have caught a fleeting glimpse of the band as they walked through.  But no.  Everybody out.  You're not allowed to do that either.  Mm-mm.  So.  You gotta love Sharon Osbourne.  Everybody knocks Sharon.  But I'm telling you something, man.  Nobody on OzFest pulls this crap.  No.  She doesn't care who you are. 
[00:16:30]  She'll just drag you into a room and scream at you.  She doesn't care who you are.  That's why Ozzy has his ass on the stage.  You think she's letting Ozzy go over curfew?  No.  No, you're not getting racked for $15,000 because he wanted to sing Paranoid at $11,15.  Poor Ozzy.  That made me sick.  Yeah, absolutely.  So we're broadcasting live from WBCN here in Boston.  Brought to you by Amazing Superstores, right?  That's the big sponsor today, Mike.  Yes, sir.  All right.  And of course, you know, Coach Mike is wearing his Boston Celtics cap. 
[00:17:00]  Thank God you did the right thing.  I tried.  Big rivalry there, huh?  Lakers and Celtics, Opie?  I have no idea.  I was going to say, can you sound more excited?  I have no idea.  It's a pretty big deal up here.  Is it?  Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.  I think it's, what, the first time in 20, 21 years?  The Celtics and the Lakers in the finals, right?  87.  87 was the last time.  Yeah, it's kind of a big deal, Anthony, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  I know you're not.  Was Larry Bird playing back then?  Of course he was.  All right.  Of course.  And Magic and Kareem and James Worthy and Kevin McHale.  Yeah, those were great days.  So, what else was Magic doing?  Yeah, I don't know.  Dropping a lot of things in the locker room and slowly getting them.  Warrior says Magic Johnson needs to oil up.  Might have dropped the soap a few times.  Warrior also says. 
[00:18:00]  And Manny Ramirez, of course, hitting number 500.  That's kind of quick, right?  He's still a relatively young dude, man.  And Griffey, Kenny, Griffey didn't hit his 600th last night.  No, he's at 599.  I go, Kenny, did Griffey hit his 600?  Yes.  He's still at 599.  I can't count good.  You got the Blackberry, and it looked like you were freaking, 
[00:18:30]  you know, getting your update from your Blackberry.  I thought that's what I read.  Kenny is just the worst.  He is so bad on the train on the way here.  Yeah.  That poor girl.  There was this blonde girl, and she's sitting alone.  And, I don't know, she just seemed to probably just want to be alone.  She was having a drink.  And Kenny just looks at her and goes,  So, you're getting all liquored up? 
[00:19:00]  And then he's like, I'm quite a catch.  Just harassing this poor girl.  And we had the nice drunken couple next to us.  So did I.  Hey, wait a minute.  Who are you kidding?  Bottle of red and a bottle of white.  That's right.  And that was for the first hour.  Yeah.  Well, it's a train ride.  What are you going to do?  Just sit there?  So, who was the drunk couple next to you?  And how could, and wow. 
[00:19:30]  Because they were.  And how drunk were they that you noticed they were the drunk couple?  Oh, because they were drinking.  They had white and red also.  Was it the one, the couple across from you?  No, they went to the left.  They went to my left.  That's what I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  The older couple.  Yeah, across the aisle.  The old bra that wanted to have some lesbian action with your fine girl.  Yeah.  And then she.  That was obvious.  Me and Kenny are like, I think that lady's interested in Anthony's girl.  I think she was that way. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, something was going on.  She was smitten.  She wasn't smitten with you.  She was smitten with your girl.  Really?  Oh, very obvious.  Wow.  A little.  She was trying to flirt with her and stuff.  She was being a little flirty.  Yeah.  And then she had her husband or boyfriend or whatever the hell that was.  And for some reason, Kenny ended up dancing with him in the aisle of the train.  Oh, yeah.  What was that about, Kenny?  You're dancing with an older gentleman.  We had a moment.  On the Amtrak?  Yeah.  What the hell? 
[00:20:30]  Kenny was.  I think Kenny.  It's good to see when Norton get embarrassed because Kenny was doing some stuff and Jimmy  was mortified when he ordered his lunch or whatever.  It was everyone else in the place we were sitting on the train.  Gentlemen, we sit in first class.  Of course.  Not that coach is bad.  I'm sure it's nice for you people that sit there.  So we're sitting there like gentlemen.  And Kenny was just, all of a sudden I hear, could I have a steak over easy? 
[00:21:00]  It was literally that loud.  Yeah.  And it was like being hit in the ears with a mallet.  And all that's on these menus is like, here, you have the choice.  You can have chicken or a salad.  Yeah.  Like the menu's real small, whatever the hell it is.  And everyone knows there's no choices.  And Kenny's making believe he's ordering at Morton's Steakhouse.  That's the soup of the day.  Speaking of Morton's, they made a nice breakfast for us.  So go to Morton's in Back Bay for Father's Day. 
[00:21:30]  They got a lot of specials, I hear.  Thank you, Kenny.  So on the train, you have two choices, salmonella or botulism.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, the old Amtrak isn't known for its cuisine.  Yeah, no, it's awful.  Hey, we dug some stuff out of storage.  You want to eat it?  Give it a whirl.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  We're live from WBCN up here in Boston, Massachusetts for a few more hours.  And then we're back to New York. 
[00:22:00]  Ah, whatever.  Well, we hinted at it.  Yes, Anthony has brought his lovely, do I say girlfriend at this point?  Jill, do we say girlfriend?  It is official.  She is my girlfriend.  We are boyfriend and girlfriend.  And you guys like to make out a lot.  You guys like to suck face a lot.  What do you think?  Do you think I'm stupid?  I'm not trashing that. 
[00:22:30]  It's just an observation.  Of course.  Should we do play jacks?  And what?  She's still at the hotel?  Yeah.  Because you guys have been dating for two weeks, I think.  How many days?  Because I actually heard you tell the older couple that was trying to get in Jill's, huh,  that I think you guys have been dating 12 days.  Yeah, it's like two weeks.  All right, two weeks.  And she's missing her third day of work today. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I hear there's a pool going on when Anthony gets her fired from her job.  Yeah.  I don't want that to happen.  Of course, she's the traffic vixen at Channel 11 in New York.  CW11 News.  And she has officially missed her third day of work since dating Anthony.  Not missed.  You know, she's got sick days.  You know how it goes.  And she'll be here very, very soon?  Yeah, she doesn't have to get up early. 
[00:23:30]  She was a hit at the tweeter center yesterday.  Of course.  We went out to say hi to the fans and stuff, and man, was she a hit.  Yeah.  A lot of people taking pictures, getting autographs, and then getting the elusive double Anthelini  autograph.  Oh.  That's the new one.  Yeah.  They actually get the Sid and Nancy photo together?  Yeah.  We do like our wine occasionally.  We'll say that.  Occasionally?  Yes. 
[00:24:00]  An occasional sip of the old red.  You could have just stopped that.  But we do like our wine.  Well.  All right.  Yeah, I was pushed right out of the way.  It was all about Anthony and Jill signing.  You were not pushed out of the way, sir.  Are you kidding me?  She was signing WOW stickers.  And she was signing where I usually sign.  I'm like, well, I'll just find another spot on this sticker.  What happened?  Yoko started signing the sticker.  Where I usually sign.  I'm like, wow, I don't know where else to sign on this thing. 
[00:24:30]  I've always signed over here.  Oh, I'm seething with resentment.  She's humming kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss be love.  All right.  Something just went off.  What?  I don't know.  Okay.  It's back on.  Let's take our first break.  We got lots to do.  We are live here in Boston at WBCN.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  still trying to figure out all the buttons we're back with the ob and anthony show we're live from 
[00:25:00]  wbcn in boston came up here for the river rave last night overall a great time was had by all  anthony was telling some of the stories uh during the break there had a good time uh toucher and  rich who do afternoons up here in boston yeah uh didn't disappoint anyone all of them walking  around completely hammered they just went on a quest for booze at one point that's pretty much uh 
[00:25:30]  it was pretty much it they walked into the dressing room and uh looked around disgusted  and just said uh you know i'm sick of drinking beer i need some hard liquor you know where any is  uh no like what jack daniels or maker's mark something like that yeah yeah perfect where is  it and then someone said i just saw somebody walk past with some maker's mark they hit where they 
[00:26:00]  went that away and uh wow they just clambered out of the room and and went to the left they were out  of the hall looking for uh they were on a quest for booze i'm glad that toucher uh is showing some  responsibility considering he just had a kid i think three four days ago oops uh collect their  booze i gotta go to jimmy for a second because you're kind of creeping everybody out jimmy why  what's the look you got you got a black sabbath uh hoodie on which uh we expect from you of course 
[00:26:30]  but underneath it is nothing but just smooth skin that keith is now i know now rubbing you don't  have a t-shirt under your hoodie and i'm thinking there's a reason for that i'll open them more if  you want not a hint of hair on his chest i'm very youthful i was uh you know what it is i packed and i  honestly forgot to bring another shirt i can't believe i did because i did laundry yeah to have a  couple of shirts and they were all stacked up nicely in my drawer so i wore my motorhead shirt 
[00:27:00]  uh yesterday i would have worn it today but uh there was an incident  back at the hotel you know how it is oh no sometimes you're too lazy to grab a towel  oh no there's your old motorhead shirt oh god yeah you didn't it's got the consistency of steel wool  right now you didn't on your motorhead shirt yeah i did so lucky us we get to see jimmy in a 
[00:27:30]  black sabbath hoodie and it's zipped halfway down to show his smooth chest it's too warm you're in a  hotel there's like 80 things you can use yes motorhead shirt is one of them  so i i have a kenny was gonna bring me a shirt but he has a brand new 2x t-shirt and bcm brought me  some i'm gonna try one of theirs but danny brought me a t-shirt that's cleaned but i hate wearing other  people's clothes i feel creepy but danny's kind of panicking i see danny's a little ocd because he 
[00:28:00]  come over the shirt's been here since six it's now one break later and he goes you know where that  shirt if not i'm gonna put it away because i don't want to get lost where's he lost it's three  inches to my left we're not cigar smoking next to it it's like anthony and i are like snot rocketing  each other and some might get on it it's completely fine right there it's nice and folded just sitting  there yeah no one's hurting it yeah panic thing about it i still don't understand how you use that  in a hotel because there are a lot of towels there's the the the sheets there's that you're 
[00:28:30]  leaving you don't have to worry about leaving uh anything anywhere i had a towel a small hand towel  and then let's just say sometimes you wipe your hands after after a mess on your hands and uh  uh well you realize oh boy hand towel wasn't enough so get up and get another towel or use the  sheet i wish i would have thought of that and i checked my wardrobe uh selection you bet that's 
[00:29:00]  what i would have done but you know jimmy you're an animal he's just an animal like a monkey in a  monkey cage god bless you i had to go to bed i was i was starting to get out of control i was online i was  looking at this and that and i'm trying so hard to stop but of course i'm in turmoil my personal life  so i i'm like it's after one i'm like just just get it done go to bed yeah go to bed sicko sicko  i can see him saying that out loud too go to bed 
[00:29:30]  as you're just going at it yeah as you're mopping up with a motorhead t-shirt i have regret it i really  like that shirt lemmy would be proud of course he would he wouldn't have it any other way  hey stunt brain is putting pictures up from our uh weekend uh onaradio.com has pictures from the  weekend with anthelini shots as well oh really anthony brook jill nicolini on her first road trip  yeah and uh she's getting along with everybody uh very well swimmingly uh my favorite observation so 
[00:30:00]  far keith also traveled with us and it's keith's job to carry many many many many  jill bags this we're we're up here for maybe 24 hours and she packed like she's going to europe  and for two weeks for two weeks and keith has to carry her bags if that's not bad enough he was  loaded up like just what like a mule or something yeah uh going through penn station but all her bags 
[00:30:30]  are pink bright pink it looks like as pink gets barbie dream luggage yeah and uh yeah a lot of it  uh apparently she you know she likes a lot of options of uh things to wear even if it's one day she did  a costume change at the river yeah i know right yeah and she she opened up the suitcase and had  i think three dresses two pairs of jeans six tops six pairs of shoes and you can never tell until 
[00:31:00]  you're at where you're at what you're gonna wear and then proceeded to take them all out and hold  them up and i had to make the choice of what she was going to wear yeah well that's your job now well  did i make a good job job you made a fine choice yes does she have an extra shirt  i know that's the difference between guys and girls jimmy jimmy brought one shirt that he needed  to use last night yeah and he wrecked it and jill brought enough stuff to wear for a week yeah even 
[00:31:30]  though we're not even going to be here 24 hours yeah yeah i can't i can't imagine what uh what it'll  be like to perhaps go away for a week oh i i don't even i just i just imagine like eight hundred dollars  in extra money for the uh airfare uh because now they're charging per bag a second vehicle  right a second vehicle just for luggage and standing by the luggage carousel for three hours  waiting for everything to come out yeah you're gonna have a hard time differentiating between 
[00:32:00]  your bags and you know everyone else is at the airport oh my god i've never seen pink bags like  that right pink bag right keith is just loaded down with i was laughing my ass off that picture's up  there yes sir all right stunt uh stunt brain has put the picture up on onaradio.com what about  the picture with robin quivers well i gotta get that one yeah did you send that one uh yeah that one  should be uh it should be there so something weird is going on man because uh saturday at the pnc 
[00:32:30]  art center we're backstage for the stp show and uh florentine who's an old friend of uh ours and you  know it goes way back with norton yeah my first paid gig in comedy was thanks to him in 1990 really  yeah jim got my first paid gig yeah jim florentine shows up with robin quivers because they're they're  dating and she could have been nicer yeah and very nice and there was a whole thing that was going on  before she got there like like uh mar who runs uh the station new york she she pulls me aside uh robin 
[00:33:00]  quivers is going to be here is there going to be any problems because everyone's wondering if there's  going to be problems between you guys and her and we just want to make sure everything's going to be  cool and stuff because she's coming as a guest of jim florentine and blah blah blah and like  what do you think's gonna happen fisticuffs we're gonna have an all-out brawl backstage yeah man  and i i would like to i would like to say differently but she couldn't have been nicer she was really nice 
[00:33:30]  to my girl nice to everybody she was a sweetheart yeah and and something's going on between the two shows  lately because anthony ran into uh howard in atlantic city and they're shaking hands i see uh fred norris  at my my freaking um this is my building yeah at the at the grocery store a couple times already  and now uh robin quivers saturday night it's just one of those things i guess so much time has gone  by and you know so much water under the bridge as they say jimmy right a regular guy would say 
[00:34:00]  regular joe well you know six to one half a dozen the other with bygones be bygones i say yeah what  are you gonna do carry to the grave says regular joe says regular joe so because we haven't really  been um it hasn't really been any conflict between uh the shows in a while so things kind of settled  down you put things in perspective and it was like like you said robin couldn't have been nicer  it was really nice to just talk talk to her and uh florentine and there's a picture of you and jill 
[00:34:30]  and i think robin and uh and uh jim florentine florentine yeah we were joking i i said uh right  before it was snapped uh i said to florentine i go well here's a great picture of two guys that  are with women they have no business being with  is that you're openly admitting you have no business being with jill  what am i i was a tin knocker and now you're a tin knocker they're saying yeah that's funny 
[00:35:00]  tin knocker that's pretty much what they're saying now that's hilarious  whoever brought that up oh that's really great  tin knocker yeah i thought that was pretty amusing classic absolutely out there that's good everybody  gets along it's good tired of all the conflict yeah enough yeah jimmy doesn't like conflict i love  it but i'm tired of it i'll be 40 soon you guys will too um it's like what are we doing uh maxwell's 
[00:35:30]  still a douche i i i mean that's a guy though for real yeah uh i i genuinely have a disdain for as  as a guy yeah i dislike him because i think he's uh uh uh revolting yeah yeah i mean that's that's  a real thing i don't like him hill man's a douche i don't know him um well trust me  trying to get a cd player to work oh how's that how's that working out for you  yeah yeah i can't wait to talk to corporate later today they insist that we go on the road 
[00:36:00]  so then we are like extremely uncomfortable doing our show that we're extremely comfortable  doing when we're in our own studio yeah where everything works nice doesn't we always have  problems look look look at this what's the matter stunt friends helping you out you have to change  his name stunt friends bugging me stunting it's just not delicious what do you want to call him  hey stunt taint can you fix the city player is just blinking away i don't i don't even know what 
[00:36:30]  that means so we got manny ramirez's uh home run call that's always good good for like 30 seconds  goodness gracious we got error 85 we'll get it what's an error 85 does anyone know it's like a band from  the 80s wasn't it i loved them here you go all right great this was supposed to be quick here we go  red sox nation gets ready for ramirez to bat for the fourth time tonight in hopes that they'll see  home run number 500 and there's so much of red sox nation to see it here tonight at camden yards it is 
[00:37:00]  amazing  out towards right center field for manny ramirez deep far number 500  one of the greatest hitters the game has ever seen takes another step towards the hall 
[00:37:30]  look anthony i know you're a Yankees fan no no i i was just gonna say you really do got  to give it to uh baseball that they do have those moments you know the game itself to sit through an  entire game especially watching at home when you're at the game it's fun you know you're drinking  beers you're doing whatever you're doing but uh when they're those moments happen like that that is  pretty cool to watch just crack and you're like oh there it goes all right how do they get the audio  of the cracking of the bat yeah that's good i know what i was gonna say is i know you're a yankee 
[00:38:00]  fan but you got to respect the the home run call that's that's how you do a home run call yeah right  jimmy there was no john sterling crap in there absolutely moment be with the moment yeah it was  don't make it about you you're not the one hitting the 500th home run of your career yeah number 500  that was a very good call and now i'm trying to get it out of the cd player and uh whatever i wish the  yankees are not dandy i'm from manny you don't hear any stupid call like that it's embarrassing 
[00:38:30]  as a yankee fan to have to have to have all other teams should do it boss you hate the yankees  just play yankee home run calls you really want to embarrass yankee fans yeah alexander the great  a bomb from a run what a douche uh the fan who caught the ball by the way yeah gave it back to  him for free really low end value was ten to fifteen thousand he could have got for that ball  what a guy he caught the ball and he goes here manny here you go this is your day your moment 
[00:39:00]  here's your ball back i don't i don't need to make uh a few uh shekels off it manny give him anything  i'm sure he'll probably end up signing a few things that's what he should do i was turning  into such a bunch of ebay vultures give the guy his ball he hit it i say that now but believe me if i  caught it i'd swallow it you lit back to your house oh i certainly would you'd sit on it right  away so no one could grab it from you they'd be panning for it for weeks panning uh manny is selling 
[00:39:30]  it and giving it uh giving the money to charity all right there you go look at look at all the good  all the good that's very nice hate good why you got some good in your life now yeah i mean i just  hate you know charitable good i think we have a chance to see the real anthony yep really yeah  we're all talking a little bit i know you're all talking behind my back we're all talking a little  bit we're like you know what this is the anthony we know that that you're all about really i think

[00:45:30]  the legendary wbcn studios must say everyone's been great to us up here in boston want to thank  gabe wellington and the rest of the gang at bcn for having us uh we got breaking news  you think i'm going to talk about the kennedy thing no the breaking news is keith the cop has  to go and get jill keith has to go get jill you have to go get the pink suitcases and you also have 
[00:46:00]  to get her starbucks order which could be the most amazing starbucks order i've ever heard yeah you know  yesterday when we were getting ready to come up here you know it it's my job as uh anthony's handler to  take care of him and his new girlfriend so i made the mistake of asking uh mistake uh no it's your  it's your duty yes i as my job i'm sorry so i didn't mean to say mistake um kenny kenny would never 
[00:46:30]  say uh mistake right kenny he'd say sorry a lot but he would never say i i made a mistake that's one of the  funniest things i ever heard these two uh so yes go ahead so you made the mistake of trying to help  this girl out who's part of your job yeah right right the embarrasser that makes anthony extremely  happy yeah that's that's smart keith yeah okay it comes from a guy who doesn't have uh his boss and 
[00:47:00]  his girlfriend has the uh wallpaper on his phone so just stay over there all right what oh well  there's there's a there's kind of competition a lot of rivalry going on between club soda kenny and uh  keith over what who can make me more nauseous it's a tie congratulations kenny he just knows that in the  head he's got the nose to do that too so yeah i'll say uh go ahead keith so she proceeded to tell me  her starbucks order which i just sat in amazement and looked at her and i said do me a favor just 
[00:47:30]  just text it to me so i have it yeah and this is this is what she likes to drink every morning right  jill nicolini from channel 11 and it the traffic vixen yes three text messages to actually get the  whole order and then i had to cut and paste them into my memo and my blackberry so this way i had the  whole thing at one and this is why starbucks needs just numbers i'll take a number five exactly listen  to this order go ahead uh jill likes a tall sized drink in a grande cup non-fat caramel macchiato 
[00:48:00]  half shot espresso two pumps sugar-free vanilla no foam extra whipped cream just a drizzle of caramel  now that's if she's with you if she's not present if i am not present get the whipped cream and caramel  in a separate cup and a lot please and always get a straw all else fails regular chamomile tea with no  milk and sugar i would say chamomile tea every time now they didn't have the machine that drizzles 
[00:48:30]  the uh the thing was broken so they had no drizzling why is she i gotta ask her why is she having no fat  she's saying a low or no fat caramel macchiato but then she wants a cup of could you bring a vat of  whipped cream and sauce please but i would like the low fat excuse me jimmy what is there a problem no i  don't get it because i want to know what the thinking is because i like just whatever it's  what she wants i don't know you're not following me you're you're thinking i'm attacking it no it's 
[00:49:00]  because i try to have low fat beverages so i'm like why is she having a loaf is there like a difference  a better taste probably the taste i don't get it i want to know why because i can't drink fatty  drinks i'm not slender i would like to ask that though why the no fat i'm sure kenny will get  satisfaction out of the fact that yesterday in penn station i went to the starbucks and i handed my  blackberry to the person because i didn't want to read this out loud yes he just hands the blackberry  over goes read this i need to make it and i failed miserably on my first attempt to get the coffee 
[00:49:30]  really first attempt was a failure but it was taken graciously yes you were allowed one slip up  she doesn't have an attitude whatsoever she's uh she's very very nice what did he do wrong what  did you bring back what was the problem well medium decaf well i made the mistake of donuts just a  cops order container of black i thought that's what you wanted cops order where where i made the mistake  was is that where she says if i am not present get the whipped cream and caramel in a separate cup 
[00:50:00]  and a lot please there's an actual radius of what she means by present she actually means present  with you in the store not present in the same building because by the time i got back with the  cup the whipped cream had already melted is that why she wants it oh see now that makes sense it makes  perfect sense you can dollop your own whipped cream into your drink right and then melt away nobody likes  it melted i mean i could have told you that of course so then she said you got me foam and not whipped 
[00:50:30]  cream and i said no and then she says oh it melted i told you get it in the cup and i said but you  we're together and she says no but we're not together in the same place i have to be there  that's cool good luck all right with that said with that said you got to read off the the order  once again but at a nice pace there keith yes i'll try this is what uh jill nicolini likes in the  morning best pace tall size drink in a grande cup non-fat caramel macchiato half shot espresso two 
[00:51:00]  pump sugar free vanilla no foam extra whipped cream just a drizzle of caramel if i'm not present get the  whipped cream and caramel in a separate cup and a lot please and always get a straw please if all  else fails regular count meal tea no milk no sugar thanks xoxo and by the way i forgot the straw yesterday  so yeah and he forgot the straw all right go get jill and her pink bags is the street team and the  hummer ready so we can go get all the luggage all that luggage okay thank you keith uh kimbo slice 
[00:51:30]  jimmy just turned me on to kimbo slice pretty much knocking some guy's ear off yeah it was a cbs uh  it was a smart move by cbs to bring this guy on because he's really everybody is a street fighter  from miami he's a tough looking dude he's like he's bald but he's got like the uh he kind of has  like a mr t thing going yes and uh he's a really tough uh tough street fighter man just bare-fisted  everyone's a cookie uh he's a well regular joe says that's one tough customer but he was i used  to street fight in miami just bare-fisted and uh so now he's kind of like a sensation uh everybody 
[00:52:00]  wants him to fight in the mixed martial arts yeah and i heard they're giving him a choice opponents  because they want to break him in i mean because as good of a fighter as he is first time out you put  up against ladella's and get killed these guys these guys yeah i mean you know these guys fight the  best fighters in the world he just kind of leans in there and and throws punches they'll just grab  your legs and put they don't care how hard you punch if they can get to your legs you finish and  that's the that's the mix the mma guys are so dangerous so uh he's doing really well against the 
[00:52:30]  guys he's fighting though yeah that is like uh kind of odd that it was on regular television like that  yeah because these are usually on things like you know spike and whatnot they will be now after that  they'll be on pay-per-view after he just knocked the guy's ear off yeah plus the ratings for cbs were  pretty amazing for for uh for the fight the other guy uh oh what's that you had a great line too  about the guy oh god the guy's ear what was the other guy's name kimbo slice and the other guy  james and just the other james thompson yeah james thompson i think his name is uh his ear blew up 
[00:53:00]  it was swollen it it didn't resemble an ear anymore it was just a sack of blood on the side of his head  that was uh not split open yet until about the third round i think and then kimbo slice just  round houses him with his uh right hand into that ear and it exploded his ear exploded on the side of 
[00:53:30]  his head yeah oh yeah his i was saying this his ear looks worse than marvin nash  which is from uh if there's no reservoir dogs you have to imagine the slice yeah marvin nash  here's the audio the video is going to form the video is going to be up on onaradio.com  kimbo's three minutes that's the way mike works kimbo slice destroying this guy's ear  kimbo slice kimbo slice slow off the stool to start the third round james thompson smells it he knows he 
[00:54:00]  can beat this man right now so here we go the third and final round this is where confidence and  experience bring you to the championship gentlemen how do you have this fight school  i have no idea i have no idea i would say that thompson right now is probably ahead  there's a big right hand by slice and now that ear pops leading that ear pops it's pumped 
[00:54:30]  another shot to the right ear kimbo slice swinging by the fences  another uppercut for our right hand  oh my god can you imagine it popped it popped it popped it popped it's an ear they're not supposed  to pop oh no oh did he get a sock in the head oh is that horrid yeah the video is up on onaradio.com 
[00:55:00]  so unbelievable it's an ear uh breaking news we got ted kenny going in into the hospital they're  gonna operate on his brain tumor and then they're gonna uh follow it up with what chemo  was the radiation was this planned i don't think it was like a party late breaking they're looking  for any any cutting edge cure they can and duke seems to have the advantage they probably knew  but didn't announce it just so it wouldn't be a media frenzy after the hospital and i'm thinking uh 
[00:55:30]  you know the last thing he wants is anyone touching his head oh being a kennedy i mean seriously i mean  they're gonna slice into his head and try to save his life i guess because that now they're starting  to say that he might only have six months left that this might be quick this is probably an  operation like just prolong him his life a little more maybe maybe make him a little more comfortable  i can't see how this is a cure or anything please they were saying this thing is just kind of  intertwined all in his brain is that what they're saying really yeah brain tumors are the worst 
[00:56:00]  that's when the worst they go he's got to leave at least they're trying to operate when they just got  to leave it you're finished yeah but they're trying to get it out maybe it's fixable that sound  medical enough maybe it's fixable yeah like it's a vcr i'm an idiot dr jim here yeah you know expert  you know they gotta cut the head open sam and pull it out and then they fixed it jimsy hey jimsy  that's a bitch yep wonder what was happening you probably had like headaches just thought they were 
[00:56:30]  hangovers and then one day you're going to the doctor and he tells you you got six months well  manny who owned the comedy show died of a brain tumor and uh he smoked a lot of pot so we weren't  surprised that he got something because man oh really it was great he was always high you think  the pot got i don't know but i mean it can it's like any type of a cancerous thing could be caused  by that kind of smoke and uh but it's a cell phone possible man he was on his phone a lot saying  ted was probably on the cell phone a lot constantly man oh man gotta watch those things and he uh 
[00:57:00]  he was getting like a little dizzy and he noticed his balance was a little off like his equilibrium  was slightly off oh and uh and then he went and he went fast too man really quick no one even knew  he was sick no one knew it and then we saw him and he got his uh he got it operated on and they just  they tried some kind of chemo and it exasperated it because it does one of two things it fixes it  or it makes the cells grow faster oh nice he's like those are the options you're either going to get 
[00:57:30]  like pretty fixed up or you're dead immediately now with him it just worked wrong you know went  the wrong way oh suck god that's awful yeah nice nice uh bring her upper there i know you think i'm  going to add something that's going to like you know make put people at ease like no no we were  kind of waiting for the laugh we were hoping you were going to twist it somehow i'll tell you a laugh  this is why this is why manny was the funniest guy i ever better know he really was that every comic  will tell you that he used to argue politics because manny was a really brilliant pro-israeli 
[00:58:00]  uh uh he was jew from israel and he was a funny dude and he would always argue with this iranian  buddy of ours hood who was a comedian they would always fight and manny's in the hospital really  sick and hood walked in and manny goes you know it's funny i always wish this would happen to you  that's brutal oh it's like god that is the sign of a funny human being wow he was just the greatest  god bless him unbelievable uh in other news sex in the city of course the number one movie at the 
[00:58:30]  box office but what uh the numbers dropped off drastically after all the chicks went and saw it  yeah on friday they had about 27 million in uh in the numbers and they were predicting an 80 million  dollar weekend but then it went from 27 million to 17 million on saturday and then down to 10 million  on sunday and in fact saturday and sunday raiders beat it handily well because they were saying at  first that uh you know the rate raiders was falling off yeah well it it's going to because it it had 
[00:59:00]  yeah it's been out there a few weeks already right you have to have some kind of a male component to it  it's like titanic is a chick flick in a way but i mean it's it's about the titanic and di caprio  so guys will go see it people teenagers will see things eight times uh but no one's going to see  this more than once these housewives can get out for a couple hours because they're dumb children  i'm boring myself no they got to get back to the cleaning and the baking you know so they can only  see it once yeah but did you hear me just guessing that was all guesswork none of that was based in 
[00:59:30]  fact i was buying it i know me too i meant it i wasn't trying to kid anybody all right he's making sense  i'd spill this on your shirt danny and uh i knew it was stupid head turning the new york paper did  did something interesting they they went to the front of uh the audience at a section of the city  you know viewing oh and took a picture of the crowd and they found what one guy there was one guy in  that picture oh that poor bastard not really he he said he went there for what the shoes and the 
[01:00:00]  pretty women or something he said he wanted to see the shoes and the women the shoes are what it's all  about all right so he was gay and the reporter just said it was the creepiest thing she'd ever  heard i went to see the shoes no he wasn't gay he probably took a cialis and a kitchen knife  probably like jerome brutus just wanted to tie them up and look at their feet and dispose of them  unbelievable anyone that goes anywhere to look at shoes should be locked up and spoken to of course 
[01:00:30]  and are you uh you're into the feet right no i i said i'm i'm into uh i think jill was asking if  you have a foot fetish no i'm into the entire package you know like a girl's got to have uh  attractive feet but on her body i'm not just you know focused on the foot like a foot fetish that's  kind of silly you know as hot as she is on tv she actually looks better in person it's very rare that  happens most girls will look better on tv because of all the stuff you see her in close up and it's 
[01:01:00]  like wow she's even better looking in person as a real life human being that almost never happens  though usually they look good on tv and you see them in person it's like stonehenge  i couldn't talk for a second right so i was watching it was so funny because her and anthony  i'm watching them they're pecking they're kissing they really dig each other and the way these trains  work is whenever you sit like with you know the the chairs facing each other you're going to have  somebody sitting across from you oh yeah so keith the cuckold is sitting on one side  anthony and jill are making out and a guy who looked exactly like a young frankenstein 
[01:01:30]  sat there across from jill a stupid peter boyle face and you've never seen it look like the  principal from first bueller's day yeah like him little jeffrey jones this year yeah sure he probably  had the same type of hard drive that jeffrey jones had a little peewee file trading and uh you've  never seen a guy try to avoid staring at breasts so badly oh my god i know yeah he was looking at the  ceiling tiles he's looking at the at the floor the lights his head was spinning around he could 
[01:02:00]  not he did not want to focus and he uh as soon as there was another seat available he got up and left  he ran he fleed why why he was very uncomfortable yeah we were he just didn't want to look at a girl  always make a scene no what what was his thing he didn't want to stare because you have to stay  comfortable well yeah the cleavage was on display i mean yeah you know can't help it yeah it was  very hard for him to sit there and not stare so uh i think he he thought best he just should leave 
[01:02:30]  the situation i was texting anthony the whole time because i could see from where it was i'm like look  at this creep across from yeah look at this ghoul this peter boyle ghoul can't look at anything he's  staring at the ceiling tiles he's looking at the lady's feet as she walks by the people tearing the  tickets yeah he's gonna track shoes the um the big question saturday at the pnc in jersey for the  stone temple pilot show and last night here in boston everyone thinks the anthony and jill  nicolini thing is a is a radio bit yeah and uh jimmy and i are here to say uh it's no bit yeah i was 
[01:03:00]  reading some stuff on the message board and um it's no bit people are like it's so obviously a bit one  guy had this big conspiracy theory that because um cw 11 reported uh something that you know opie  wasn't too happy about reporting uh that they sent jill over to uh hang out with me to smooth things 
[01:03:30]  over so that they don't get involved in any kind of legal action all right how great i wish that were  true how powerful the show would be that'd be great the view says something we don't like barbers over  underneath and then some people were saying um uh they commented on the pictures and said well they  look like they're you know getting along pretty well in some of these pictures and then uh uh some  people were saying no obviously you know they've been talking about the show for over a year uh 
[01:04:00]  they're friends and uh that's all they do that's why they just hang out and stuff some people just  refused to uh to buy into it did she have a crush on you the whole time when she came in the studio  that day have you guys my birthday have you guys discussed this yeah you know we obviously uh liked  each other a little bit from afar yeah kind of afar i always thought when when she was up in the  helicopter that she was very fun in the helicopter and very uh very cute so yeah you know there was 
[01:04:30]  something going on but you know what am i what am i gonna do hi cute traffic girl can i go out with  you you just don't do that how'd you ask her because anthony told uh told me officially while  they were sitting on a sofa uh in the green room yesterday we're just chatting to the two of them  there was a big couch with just two of them in the middle nobody wanted to sit next to me we only  want to just be like emotion blockers because there was no sex but you don't want to be a love blocker  you don't want to get in the in the way of the wine pouring is what is what you're getting at 
[01:05:00]  you want to talk about long island rubbish they're drinking fine wine out out of red plastic cups  it was everything you thought it would be long island trash and poor keith he's in over his head  on this one he had to go to a liquor store to get more bottles of wine yeah he had to drive out to  the liquor store to get uh some more wine because you know you can't drink the crap they they supply at  these venues i went with them and we stopped at five different places but they were all closed like i  think i don't know the blue laws apply up here still he uh wound up getting some though well 
[01:05:30]  you brought a fine bottle of wine to the venue and they wouldn't let you pour it yeah first they  wouldn't let us even open it at the venue they go we have they go we have our own wine yeah it's crap  i don't like it but anyway you were seeing them on the couch oh yeah yeah and so anthony goes uh  how did you say that you told me like yeah we're officially boyfriend and girlfriend yeah  because we were hanging out and i just said hey will you be my girlfriend and she said yeah will 
[01:06:00]  you be my boyfriend and i said yeah and then what happened then we're boyfriend and girlfriend no then  what happened don't get into details like that you crazy see it's changing now now we're not allowed  to say anything no she probably doesn't care she seems open she doesn't care less yeah but what am  i gonna do sit there and go yeah we did this yes that's what you should do we did this that's what  friends do it yeah that's what friends that's right they share they would make it out the whole it's 
[01:06:30]  real though it's like they really the entire time we enjoy each other's company how can you tell you  you never talk she probably don't know the direct pronunciation of your last name she's probably  this is kumia right or is it kumia well you know look we don't blame you of course not who would  you're giving us uh these this weird look we don't blame you we're just uh we're just uh you know 
[01:07:00]  telling our observations yeah this was a whole chat on the train last night he went train and  she went goes fast and they kissed all through harford and new haven and stanford and bridgeport  and providence oh they barely came up for air we're very smitten with each other i felt like i was back  in junior high watching like my my friend make out a chick right next to me yeah while we're in the 
[01:07:30]  same room i hope he's trying to sleep alone poor hope's got his little pillow i got a seat alone  he's got big dumb kenny running up and down the aisle it's like a big german shepherd  it's hilarious kenny's bothering everyone on the train he really was a nudge all right we're  gonna take another break here kenny do we have to promote anything how about that amazing superstore  thing right here comes kenny with the kenny go latest plug yes everybody patronize amazing super 
[01:08:00]  stores and don't forget morton's in back bay on boylston  why just so fun to stop him with a hand gesture jimmy was waving him off jimmy's giving him the no  don't don't say that thing takes just sign and he stops just show him a shiny object really fast and  then kenny doesn't even know where he is anymore and make sure you go to morton's on oh a pinwheel  it's like when the cats can jump on the cat you just hold up a little water pistol and he just 
[01:08:30]  stops but not leap up yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm just trying to be attentive to you guys yeah yeah yeah  yeah i all right we're gonna take a break we're live from boston it's opie and anthony  there we go  you're checking out the opie and anthony show phone number one eight six six two one two o n a  broadcast live from wbcn in boston so everything is very unfamiliar today but uh that's all right 
[01:09:00]  what else is going on today is hillary dropping out of the the race officially why would she  laughter uh tomorrow two more primaries and she's going to make one push for superdelegates  then she's going to go the superdelegate uh route she's trying she thinks if she can stand up  and say i got more votes officially than obama you should vote for me superdelegates 
[01:09:30]  oh she's gonna try to sway them yep yeah good luck to you she's so done she's got no momentum  obama's got all the the heat yeah and then mccain will win i want to hear the audio this audio of  one of her it's amazing again i like the fact that this it's so funny to watch the liberals kind of  biting each other because like with the language obsession and it's almost like this paranoid climate 
[01:10:00]  they've helped to fuel yeah is they're turning they're just like running in circles biting their  own asses and this one it was a woman who said something about brock's she mentioned that he was  black and uh she's right it shouldn't be a problem what she said and it's not wrong what she said but  the fact they make a big deal about it well sorry sweetie but that's also a climate you helped to  foster you know why can't you mention that he's black i don't think he cares i mean black people do  this was after they made the deal to split up the delegates from michigan and florida and they 
[01:10:30]  essentially said we're cutting it right down the middle and hillary didn't like that because she got  everything in michigan because barack wasn't on the ballot yeah and so they were very unhappy that he  was getting anything out of michigan and that she was getting half of the florida delegates why  wasn't brock on the ballot he pulled out because you weren't supposed to get any legal results and  hillary even said these these votes aren't going to count this was back in january she said you know  the florida and michigan aren't going to count and now she's saying those two have to count oh so she 
[01:11:00]  is kind of being uh uh phony about it yeah completely why wouldn't they count though because the rules  committee said if you hold your primaries ahead of the schedule we've laid out then we're not going to  count your delegates so then why would they hold it before the time that they said you get huge advertising  money think of all the tv and radio ads that run for those primaries and if your state is the one  that says our primary put the person over the top you claim the nominating process so that's what it 
[01:11:30]  was all there's all about money and pride and and but the rules but the rules committee won't give the  votes because they didn't follow their rules right it's amazing how the the popular vote it there's always  a way where what people want isn't done i'm getting very liberal i apologize oh yeah listen to me let's  dump tea in the harbor shut up jim so we got this audio of uh the clinton supporter mouthing off uh  very interesting stuff here check this out i'm proud to be an older american woman where are you from 
[01:12:00]  new york city hillary state the best nominee that's possible and the democrats are throwing the election  away for what an inadequate black male who would not have been running had it not been a white woman  that was running for president oh my god oh boy sounds like a fun person to travel with yeah oh imagine 
[01:12:30]  that in the passenger seat the whole time wow look at the map uh she continues right of course she does a  a little more there all right and i'm not gonna shut my mouth anymore i can be called white but you  can't be called black that's not my america it's a quality for all of us it's about time we all stood  up for it right i'm no second class citizen i really i gotta be honest she's right about the the double 
[01:13:00]  standard in the language oh yeah but whenever like white people start mentioning like what america  used to be it's like what all right let's go what pre-60s go ahead talk your turn  it's like it really is amazing this i call it the good old days  yeah that was uh you're not a victim first of all that voice it was horrible can you imagine 
[01:13:30]  i'm an older american okay old dust bunny womb i'll have eggs over easy just wherever she goes  she talks like that the early bird special her womb looks like brigantine castle in new jersey yeah  just a burnt out husk keith go to starbucks and get me my coffee  uh in other news obama what he's finally saying goodbye to his church yep yeah i guess a little 
[01:14:00]  too much uh controversy there he's uh quit his chicago church after 20 years over of course uh  the the good pastor's uh comments well no it wasn't just reverend right now it was this white guy  the white guy had the nerve to mention that uh he was a whiny white woman father flager  father flagers an ass sounds like the other guy's name almost 
[01:14:30]  uh can yeah i heard this audio and um first of all he's trying to sound like a black guy  father flager yeah father flager is trying to sound uh like like a black guy he's putting that black  inflection on his voice oh no and he's just saying things like he's getting all caught up in the moment  and he's getting loud and um yeah he had to obama had to just bail  problem i'm just my whole job is just to try to figure out how to work this equipment today 
[01:15:00]  era 86 i don't know what the hell's going on just give us our new york studio where we know what how  everything works could just get that thing to play all right i am so out of the conversation because all  i'm doing is trying to figure out how to do stuff over here how come it's not playing i don't know  jimmy you're good opie is it broken stupid corporates uh yeah it's a good idea you really should all  right uh what were you guys saying because now i'm back because i think i got it queued up we were 
[01:15:30]  saying that uh are they ants yeah i'm serious what yeah i forgot to all about two three how you see  the white guys speaking with a black inflection okay i have to erase the point yeah all right the  reverend uh mike all right all right here's uh here's what he had to say oh my god he spoke last  sunday at pastor wright's former church about hillary clinton's tears as she felt the democratic  nomination slip away i really don't believe it was put on i really believe that she just always thought this 
[01:16:00]  is mine i'm bill's wife i'm white and this is mine i just gotta get up and step into the plate and then  out of nowhere came hey i'm barack obama and she said oh damn where did you come from i'm white i'm  entitled to the black man stealing my show tonight barack obama said i am deeply disappointed in father 
[01:16:30]  flagers divisive backward-looking rhetoric which doesn't reflect the country i see or the desire  of people across america to come together in common cause later in that same sunday sermon  flagr acknowledged that he might have rekindled the controversy i'm sorry i don't want to get you in any  more trouble the live streaming just went out again actually it took several days before this  video started streaming and flagr this afternoon apologized i regret the words i chose on sunday 
[01:17:00]  these words are inconsistent with senator obama's life and message and i am deeply sorry if they  offended senator clinton or anyone else who saw them ironically the same words flagr used when we spoke  inside his church last month about reverend right are ones he might have used tonight i don't think  he had any intention to hurt brock he loves brock and i i think that his pain and the moment you know took 
[01:17:30]  over here's the america that i know how about you put a bunch of people in a room and they whine like a  bunch of babies and then apologize for it yeah it's a white how great is this country it's a white guy  saying who's like he's accurate with what he's saying about white entitlement but he's he's speaking  to black people kind of knocking white people so the black candidate has to sound like a white guy  and yeah that's not the america the whole country is just filled with frauds there's not one honest 
[01:18:00]  person about race in public life you can't be but that guy was a little um first of all yeah i love  seeing this self-hating white people when they get in a group of black people and they have to seem you  know they have to put down the man yeah like oh white a white woman and she's entitled what  you know what i take away from that clip though i uh i was brought up catholic and i don't go to  church anymore because it was a bore fest yeah if if if if the catholic church talked like that every 
[01:18:30]  sunday oh well not that i would agree i would i would i would have to go for the show we'll go to a  baptist church i i'm starting to think maybe that's the way to go to get a little religion  back in my soul oh really do you need that well i mean you mean the soul  but the catholic church is all  it's all monotone 
[01:19:00]  fear and i couldn't take it anymore so i i left i i don't go to church on sundays anymore because it's  a bore but man you got a guy you know hooping and hollering like that and then they get and then  they sing songs and stuff i think that's the church for me make it into a little rock show  well you you have fun there i think i'll uh steer clear yeah so obama said uh goodbye to that church  and here's uh that story michelle and i told uh reverend otis moss uh that we were uh 
[01:19:30]  uh withdrawing as members of trinity now it's a decision that uh michelle and i had discussed  for quite some time to more after the national press major club episode i had discussed it with reverend  moss we had prayed on it uh we had uh how do you do that uh consulted with a number of friends and  family members who were also uh connected to the church uh and so uh this is not a 
[01:20:00]  decision i come to lightly uh in and frankly it's it's one that i no decision i make some  slightly a little race joke don't worry come on yeah he's uh he's a phony too because you know  the only reason he's doing that is because he's he wants to be president obviously it's a smart  movie we had to get out of the church they just won't shut up right but a bunch of kooks in there  but a bunch of kooks kooks you're absolutely right he'll he'll he'll be back with the church 
[01:20:30]  when this whole thing uh is over as far as yeah him going for the presidency yeah it's  so funny though he'll be back it's it's almost like geraldine ferraro who's as ultra left as you  can get said that something about barack being black and then she had to apologize and kind of  back away from hillary and then randy rhodes uh attacks uh geraldine ferraro in a joke form in a  stand-up thing so what is the what does the ultra liberal do she complains uh uh she she called randy  roads of sex it's like they're just every one of them is obsessed with language yeah and they're 
[01:21:00]  biting each it's so funny to watch these idiots self-destructing over their own their own fraudulent  arrogance every little word they pick apart they they people are we just we're a nation of just  annoying little little chickens we just cluck at each other i know i'm kind of glad the rest of the  the world hates us they should just can't get away with saying anything no uh without them picking  everything apart and trying to turn it into some kind of uh racial or sexual uh controversy 
[01:21:30]  yeah hillary's a woman and she's white and obama's a guy and he's black there deal with it  how funny would be if we got fired for that yeah wait a minute what what outrageous shock jock says  horrid things i'd like to apologize for pointing out that she is a white woman and he is a black man  speaking of speaking of being outrageous we did an interview for the boston globe on the way to the 
[01:22:00]  venue and uh we talked about all sorts of things and and the guy's trying to get us in trouble with  the mayor ten years later here in boston we brought up a little comment about uh the mayor menino and  uh that's the only thing that made the story where's our exclusive interview with the boston  globe that was such a big deal that it had to be done kenny was panicking and and emails and text  messages are going back and forth because he's trying to set up the interview because it's very  important for everybody that we talk to the boston globe we talked for 15 or 20 minutes on the way to

[01:28:00]  like this you have to act like i'm good but when i'm talking like this i'm the black guy so really i  have to sell my own soul because you can't be honest with your listeners  that was what walter and johnson you're saying i think walton and johnson i could be right and  what happens one guy does uh three or four characters at the same time yeah it's really it's really fun  you sit there like a dope i bombed so badly because houston has never been a good market for  me i'd run nobody in houston really horrendous i bombed so badly on that show they had to go to 
[01:28:30]  break they were playing an asian comics song guitar parodies wow but they would they were being okay  about it but then they were mean to bill burst and i don't like them oh well just screw them yeah and  bill for wrecking my relationship with them why did bill get in the way of your relationship what  did they say about bill i don't remember you don't remember right now probably they just who  knows called him a homosexual oh i don't know i'm just speculating what but that's such a guy thing 
[01:29:00]  they were all such guys it's like the first thing we said what is he he's probably gay  we really are one track dummies yeah you're either a fruit a girl's a whore or someone's gay  nine o'clock i'll see you tomorrow uh other things happening so did you see the alien video or or we're  just getting the screen cap so wow uh unbelievable we gave everyone this story last week there's a guy  that he's uh he's gonna release uh a live action video of an alien yeah he took some video of uh of 
[01:29:30]  an alien yeah and uh i saw one still from it and uh we're on chilling breitbart i believe it's on  breit bart we hate breit bart i was talking to somebody who knows him the driver when i was doing  the hbo thing the driver who was taking me around he's like yeah because i know drudge i'm like well  do you know matrage he's like yeah yeah and i know andrew breit bart breit bart i'm like could you  tell him to not douche us again please yeah yeah they were the ones that got us in trouble for a 
[01:30:00]  homeless charlie but i mean just yeah great bart putting a blogger up there like will it affect  the merger some fat kid in his basement in dc my friend works for the the uh whatever the people nab okay  yeah so uh what's what's up with the alien and uh i saw it and it was uh chilling  uh it is uh indeed an alien looking through the window of a house um and the guy uh took the video  of this alien who's apparently outside looking in the window and he's in his living room or somewhere 
[01:30:30]  and you could see it just peeking up over the windowsill looking into the window because that's  that's what an alien would do peek into windows you're uh peeking around wouldn't you what if you  were on another planet what are you gonna do standing like an idiot or start peeking into  what you think of their houses well that's why i know it's phony because if it was an alien he's  not going to be like peeking around he's wouldn't you no he's got the abilities to do whatever the  hell he wants he's not going to be sneaking around superman he's an alien he's going to destroy your 
[01:31:00]  house and eat you for a snack do that maybe we're not tasty i'm just thinking he would sit there  and look in the window why would he be scared where he would be like kind of peeking about  out just came from another planet he's got he's got ray guns and all sorts of let's see yes will  let's say let's say you went to another planet you're walking around you see what looks to be  the residence of one of these uh aliens what do you do hello yeah no you peek in the window first 
[01:31:30]  no because you have windows you got better abilities if you were able to get from your  planet to their planet you got the upper hand you don't know if we're savages though  how you know they probably know we got guns and stuff they scare us we uh we shoot they laugh at  our guns do they yeah they but they can melt them with their uh ray beams yeah think like old school  superman or something like they could just like tie them into a nod or oh by the way um by uh chilling 
[01:32:00]  i meant completely fake and phony oh okay yeah this is the dumbest fake alien thing i've ever seen  it it look at this worse than alien autopsy worse remember alien autopsy how ridiculous that was back  in the day alien autopsy is it true are we watching an actual autopsy of an alien no we're not no it's a  rubber uh little uh little alien guy it's an alien sex doll i didn't think it was that bad the alien  autopsy was at least well shot and well done it looked real didn't it look you know old they had 
[01:32:30]  kind of a black and white they were trying to make it look old but yeah it was obvious it wasn't old  so yeah this one looks really uh strange it's your typical big-headed big-eyed alien  uh looking in through the window and i i apparently the mode the the film of this  is pretty much just that only he hops up and down a little bit yeah the guy uh the poor little guy 
[01:33:00]  can't get a good look the guy that was part of the interview said in the full motion video uh you  see the alien uh clearly bobbing his head up and down a few times all right good good alien yeah  is there a happy alien standing above him you bob that head  try to grab his ears there's nothing there holes in the head you got to put your fingers in there  they were there until kimbo punched them off we tie it all together yeah i like that very very good  all right so so what more video will more to come we'll keep you posted that's just a photo the 
[01:33:30]  actual video comes out what tomorrow i don't know whenever this guy is gonna he said it's gonna be  released as part of some uh some ufo documentary yeah he's milking it whatever um in other news we  got a kid uh at the spelling bee what's this story about mike he's mispronouncing a word or something  the big spelling bee was on the weekend the big scripts howard spelling bee and they gave this  kid a word and he didn't quite understand what it was and uh he and that's where the laughter 
[01:34:00]  comes from the hilarity ensues okay numbnut  what do you want numbnuts what  numbnut  numbnut is a felt or sheepskin pad placed between a horse's back and the saddle to prevent chafing  can can i can i get can i say it and then you say it yeah numbnut 
[01:34:30]  oh numbnut  that's a relief  let's scream hindi  numbnut  n-u-m-n-a-h  numbnut  how do kids know how to spell 
[01:35:00]  how do kids know how to spell i don't know how do you know an h went on the end of that because he  asked the origin i think and a lot of times the origins will give you right he said where's the  origin  shut up and they study for years the parents keep them locked in a basement but if you don't know  the word it's like oh numbnut i guess like oh yeah i learned that when i was three years old  uh who wrote the story for the show today uh me you spelled it wrong i did  you spelled it like like any of us would have known the proper spelling oh i spelled it phonetically 
[01:35:30]  you spelled it n-u-m-n-u-h that was on purpose so we said it right  that's really that's radio spelling yeah oh really yeah so it's easy  well we thought we finally had something on no on stunt brain there's plenty more  my isn't the word phonetically spelled phonetically  what's uh do we have the audio from last year's spelling bee yeah yeah yeah can we play that who has  it yeah it got cleared you got it i got somewhere in front of me uh-oh oh really

[01:36:30]  yeah just seems like an awkward they talk about how they get together with their spiritual leaders  and pray how do you how do you break into the prayer here's that's a lazy man's way of talking  to god you kneel with another guy and uh  keith has arrived with jill oh and she is uh brightening up the studio immediately and keith  looks completely exhausted he's carrying one two three four five bags four coffees coffees keith you

[01:43:30]  very proud to have that and uh and then he goes well i changed it and he he shows it to me and  it's just a pile of dog crap yeah because that's not aggressive and psychopathic that's good oh i  know what a lunatic you ever see that movie with madeline snow and kurt russell where they're the  happy couple and the the psycho cop becomes like just just turns on them that's what's gonna happen  with him wow i never thought he'll be trying to be somewhere and just fall in love and he'll be  peeking behind the lawn chairs the scope and a rifle are you secretly depressed that you lost

[01:46:30]  jill jill's coming with us smoopy jilly hey jilly poopy bear anthony talks at the lower part of  his mouth like his neck moves a little bit more when he talks he goes like jilly  you do that's what he does he uses the bottom part like okay he just gets very cute and we want  to now that she's here we want to thank jill for playing dj in the limo at uh 12 30 a night as we're  all trying to sleep on the way to the hotel it was terrific none of us were we're brave enough 
[01:47:00]  to tell you to turn the music down if it was keith or kenny or danny or or stunt brain oh boy there  would be no music in that limo i actually kind of liked it though i mean it was nice to i but  none of us wanted to feel like old men it's like you got the you know the the younger woman playing  like loud tunes and we're all like yeah yeah we didn't want to admit that we usually take naps at this  time why you turn that down a bunch of creeps having metamucil dozing off in the limo a bunch  of fairies that's us having fun on the road but uh jill's uh bringing a whole new angle to the thing

[01:55:00]  body ever uh he he had a zipper down and i swear i thought he had a white t-shirt on  is that smooth he was bare chested because he he had a motorhead shirt but he used it last night to  clean up with so he can't uh he can't wear it uh until it's washed i guess so uh jill has uh offered  one of her uh pieces of clothing out of her a lot of clothing that she brought in her pink luggage

[02:03:30]  side well on the website wow look at keith thinking yeah yeah if if jimmy's helmet hasn't  really rubbed up me oh can we launder can we launder that by the look jill's making i don't i don't  think uh put somebody else's uh we have a better chance of her ordering her own uh drink at starbucks  then then jimmy as a woman you don't want to put on a dress until it's washed that your boyfriend's  friend just had on with his hog bounce i mean i don't want to dock by proxy i don't do it for 
[02:04:00]  real proxy stuff is irritating uh derek uh because of the boston globe calling us the radio rascals  came up with this real fast uh the radio rascals it's the ob and anthony show radio rascals let's get  ready to chuck up you are radio rascals radio rascals you are radio rascals radio rascals opie and anthony

[02:05:00]  the best part is that you still have your sneakers and white socks on jimmy and no dignity  what as long as my calves are in the picture  he's also on uh pal talk i guess huh yeah they know please of course  drink it in probably all seen worse of course they have a few late nights  please if anyone has screen cap there's quite a few of me back in the day  legs open up on the desk scrapping oh god oh yeah 
[02:05:30]  wonderful kenny did we get all the plugs in club soda kenny everyone and and is our train on time  i didn't check yet but i will check about the train and  we had a beautiful breakfast morton's back bay boylston street  and maybe jill and anthony could get some gifts from the amazing superstore 
[02:06:00]  well that sounds great yeah because it's like an adult-like store oh is that it yeah yeah their motto  is excite your life amazing superstore fantastic you need to excite your life anthony no not at all  it's exciting right now i don't think i need to go to any store at this point and pick up a marital  aid but you know a lot of people do oh my god what did we get our and i'm saying what did we get 
[02:06:30]  ourselves into because we're part of this yes jimmy's wearing a dress i know it's gotten to the  point where jimmy's now wearing women's clothing i normally wouldn't i like to wear women's clothes  makes me feel much closer to them  no i would wear a panties if i thought it made me feel sexy i don't care yeah yeah i don't care but  it doesn't well i wish it did i would love that like an innocent fetish like that wait jill uh 
[02:07:00]  thumbs up or down on guys wearing panties straight guys wearing great guys wearing a girl's thong or  something like that probably not a thong i'm guessing if you can wear a thong wrong yeah you're probably  starring in karate movies but if you're gonna wear like let's say a larger uh but like boy shorts  no regular panties bloomers like granny panties silken if you're gonna wear them you gotta get a sexy  pair just like the 70s look i guess right a lot of material still around there yeah regular panties 
[02:07:30]  regular panties keep it as you are looks good like that are there any examples in here yes  jesus i am not gonna rummage gonna rummage through the panties no yeah you might grab  the wrong pair i know how girls have to travel almighty this is rfk's hat  look like looks like lincoln's pillow 
[02:08:00]  all right well we're wrapping up our stay here in boston almost done uh just can't get over the  picture of jimmy in a dress that's up on radio.com up there bothering everybody is it looks a little  better than you thought it would that might be a problem yeah it's silly but it's like it's not  it's silly but it's not completely ridiculous on you yeah that's because pockets too oh i didn't know 
[02:08:30]  that yeah oh wow now you can wear it on the train this one oh watch what you reach in there you can  kind of toy around with things oh this is wonderful i think it's good because he's uh  he's also so hairless it's not like a big hairy guy with big chest hair coming out the top of the  dress my name is william and i like to wear dresses my name is william and i like fingernail polish  i'm gonna get rid of all my male clothes and get only girl clothes 
[02:09:00]  somebody you can relate to i didn't know there was pockets there's pockets in there  camera my phone this is great oh look this is great wow all a boy needs and you get a nice breeze  under there that could you know dry things out if you're a little sweaty i very rarely am you'd be  surprised yeah i have to wear like heavy gear in the gym to sweat hooded sweatshirt i don't sweat  yeah all right sweaty so uh we did a lot today what a day yeah anthony uh made official he's uh 
[02:09:30]  dating jill nicolini who's uh well we've been dating well i know but you made it official to  the listeners because someone said it that we all feel like uh we're dating jill nicolini one of the  listeners said that so they need updates living vicariously through i think eventually they're  going to fade away with their updates so uh no the only update is that i guess we're boyfriend  girlfriend yeah and that anthony does sing amaze to me oh see isn't that sweet 
[02:10:00]  no he is so sweet you are so cute honey my little schnookums thank you bear thank you poopsie  you guys got pet names yet where are we at i don't think we've come up with any pet names yet  no no pet names no but you do look good in my little kitty cat suit oh yeah yeah i have a lot  of cats and he loves my cats right they're adorable and uh has admitted that he likes cats so it's over  the years but so that's not a huge surprise but what's the kitty cat suits tell them about the 
[02:10:30]  cat suit it's it's a blanket on the bed that's very fuzzy it's uh uh it almost feels like a lamb wool  really and uh if i have it over me it looks like i'm a giant cat no a little cute cat and and you know  close to what you're acting like  so i'm assuming and then if you're close to naked and my belly gets scratched then i can purr 
[02:11:00]  do it do it honey see i could purr because it you know i'm okay hope he's taking his headphones  off he's leaving the studio that pretty much put it over the top uh jimmy i'm gonna dress  and that is faggier than what i'm doing oh my god oh my god i look like chuck connor's next to you 
[02:11:30]  right now  and you guys have been dating 13 days yes wow yeah i like to say you guys announced jill  announced it to the whole train yesterday yeah by the way jill yes oh we didn't even bring this did  we bring this up on the air the uh the old couple you guys were talking to across the way on the  train the married couple you know the older woman won your bed right she she had a little bit she  had some tendencies you think oh look look at the haircut well i know i know ramon was his name and 
[02:12:00]  that was kelly and ramon was hitting on kenny's wow ramon  and kenny and him danced yeah they had romantic moments i put on some luther vandross  and they were dancing to here and now were we on the quiet car because uh there was nothing quiet  about our ride up to boston jill decided to play music for the whole car and no one was gonna tell  her no he was being loud ordering food and dancing and yeah no one was gonna tell her no we'll see how 
[02:12:30]  the uh return trip goes i think we're all gonna just crash kenny uh keith you ready to carry jill's  luggage out of here we're just about done you gotta zip that up how many pounds of luggage would you  say and don't exaggerate because it you don't need an exaggeration on this one the big one is  definitely 50 plus pounds that absolutely easy 50 that is true i have one of those miniature scales  i keep at the house and when i left i did weigh it i know what's funny about this and i don't want to 
[02:13:00]  blow up his spot but as far as being a cop keith is way up there let's just say he he does very well  for himself uh but in this organization he is carrying pink luggage pink like and he's gotta  say to everybody that looks at him he keeps saying it's not mine it's not mine just say it is yours  yeah so the one bag alone is close to 50 or over 50 over 50 we were here for 24 hours exactly  my point just in case jimmy did you fart or something no what happened nothing like did you see the back of 
[02:13:30]  the dress blow up nothing why are you going like this i don't know  you're taking on the mannerisms of a girl because you got a dress on man  i thought something happened no no no i was he put his hands up to his face like this like  you're right yeah yeah i didn't realize yes i was i was going through a thought process oh okay  i just caught you out of the corner of my eye i'm like what is going on with jimmy i thought you farted 
[02:14:00]  no no what you asked me was kind of accurate like i feel that urge and i just walked through the  process of what if something else happened and i'm in this dress i swear to god and i was going through  this process to myself and you looked over that's my face like oh my god okay mortifying all right  oh because there's not much camouflage there none if something happened it's awful so keith uh the one  bag is 50 pounds the one thing the rolling one yeah all right and then what we got two or three more  right yeah the uh the other pink one is probably 35 pounds it's safe to say close to 100 pounds of 
[02:14:30]  luggage for 100 pounds for 24 hours and you guys are going away this weekend and the pocketbook weighs  about 20. yeah i can't wait to see what a whole you know weekend uh of luggage are you gonna get  more luggage than this i have the whole it's tommy hilfiger and i have about six pieces total so i have  all pink extra large large medium small carry wheelie you name it how are you guys gonna get that down  on it where you're going easy you just wheel it to the uh there's more luggage weight than jill weight 
[02:15:00]  yeah we may have to pay extra now all right keith once you load up like a mule a bag of shells keith  is going to start loading up jill's uh bags yeah uh yeah danny said what you just brought underwear  that was it i brought underwear and a spare shirt yeah and it's in the same bag as my laptop  i packed it i i took a book bag for our trip up here jimmy has only one t-shirt and uh jill 
[02:15:30]  nicolini has over 100 pounds of luggage over 100 pounds that is correct wait do you want your dress  back oh my goodness jimmy just blasted one oh god welcome to the show jill that needs to be laundered  yeah i don't think don't wash it with the uh the lemmy shirt the motorhead shirt have you worn that  one on tv not oh please never or not yet what do i do now the tag just came off yeah so now you can't 
[02:16:00]  even bring it back yeah oh god all right well it's been fun kenny wow any any last thoughts jesus  wbcn is requesting bonus show okay what all right we'll do like that'd be nice all right we'll do a  few more minutes what what do you have a train to wait for we'll do a couple more stories the real  case and hurry up and wait regular joe all right we'll be back with more show in just a bit it's opie and anthony 
[02:16:30]  and we're back with the opie and anthony show i i just pulled out the music  i don't like why well we're not uh in familiar surroundings so it gets a little weird yeah we're 
[02:17:00]  uh wrapping up our broadcast here in uh boston and uh we've had a lot of fun even though we don't even  feel like we've been here because it's just been kind of a a whirlwind trip yeah we kind of kind of a  military operation get in get out what is that about if we're gonna come up here we should come up here  hang out would it be nice to like go to newbury street and have some lunch and just mellow out 
[02:17:30]  and hang out a little bit no show show the sites a little bit you know like leave your room every  once in a while my leave well eventually you're gonna have to leave no you're boring all that sex and  stuff i was in the room next to you guys it's like the one night they've chosen to go to bed like two  saints you're seeing me my straddling my stupid pillow with a little glass up against the wall  we should talk about that we all got our keys oh god my reaction was very different from jimmy's 
[02:18:00]  because i was exhausted and i asked that what his room was we could say it now it was like 418 or  something like that and i was uh 422 and i breathed a sigh of relief because i wanted to sleep and jimmy had  the opposite i got 419 which we called hitting the lotto right which was the room right next to  anthelini so i'm like good they're gonna unknowingly walk me through something  and uh i heard some jibber jabber a little chit chat and hear what they were saying i figured i'd 
[02:18:30]  wait before i get up against it all of a sudden it got very quiet i'm like oh this is going to be  good horrible snoring you heard going honey are you awake no i didn't hear snoring i just knew they  would just sleep because it was quiet i was very disappointed yeah they're like responsible couple  busy day i know uh they were saying to get some dirt on anthony like there's got to be something  weird he likes that's how great would that be right yeah a little slippage yeah well um maybe in the 
[02:19:00]  future i'll slowly jill reveal some you've been doing the show for the last hour you got to give  us something on anthony please i told you that he likes singing amazed that was whatever we know he  likes singing because he's a good singer we know he has a heart somewhere in there trust me yes we've  been saying it for a long time he just didn't want to admit it turn to the kevlar and swastikas yeah  it's there right um okay so that doesn't surprise us and the cat thing doesn't surprise us okay what  about flowers he sent me two dozen roses with a little note do i know what the note said yeah 
[02:19:30]  oh can i tell him what the note said yes no wait wait hold on honey stop it come on  aunt you said the same gift that apollo creed sent the mayor's wife  what did the note say why do you want to know because because because because a lot of people out  there think this is a radio bit this would be perfect uh why can i just put on a dress and farted into it 
[02:20:00]  yeah that's different but inquiring minds want to know she wants she wants okay she's proud of  you of course she likes the fact that you're a sweet guy oh jimmy look at jimmy i love jimmy's  attempt at at bringing this out so i'll go oh yeah okay jimmy you're right but am i right though do you  not like i think the fact that she she knows that anthony has this reputation of being like one of these  shock jocks and the fact that he's this sweet genuine dude he is the most i don't even he's  no no no he's the sweetest sss right you told me that the other day i said he was sweet he's like no 
[02:20:30]  you are no you are you know how you go through that no i don't no no i've never been through that  you know i would i defy any couple um to tell me that uh uh you've never never done things like this  never it was for us it was more like you're a c yeah well you're impotent 
[02:21:00]  uh so we're not gonna know what the note said i guess you can know what the note said  yeah i don't i don't want to push the note said well it's on the refrigerator now it says um  it's on our refrigerator or no i didn't say our  okay it's on the refrigerator it's on the refrigerator and it says dear jill  i am amazed by you right thank you i love you love anthony yeah what that's what it said 
[02:21:30]  that's all we'll say was there more no but i think that was it is that early as far as  love well i got a nice note this morning too that was left in the bathroom is it in your pocket  still it's in my bag which is outside oh damn it could we uh wait now we need to know what she wrote  you it's a nice little note it was there uh you know something less loving hey aunt thanks for the  trip be in touch make sure keith gets it strong right right make sure keith gets it strong 
[02:22:00]  all right and it's digging for the note that jill wrote him this is for all the people that think  that this is a radio bit trust me it's it's not a radio bit i've never seen anthony act like  here's with it and i've been hanging with him for 14 years 14 14 what uh go ahead man what's  the note from jill okay it says i love you anthony have a great show see you soon my love love 
[02:22:30]  yours always jill x-o-x-o  i think this is a nice uh slow healthy progression  i like that it's not at all coming off like two lost souls desperately clinging in a storm  nice to see two people getting to know each other  four belts of booze i love you me too  let's get married this weekend 
[02:23:00]  it's amazing that's where we're oh oh  oh wow oh boy now it's been now the cat's out of the bag  speculation speculation blinds you see copy paste copy paste nice that the cat's out of the bag you're  not under the blanket cutely  jimmy it's me and you kid oh it's me and you this is frightening it really is frightening

[02:24:00]  no but the the flowers and the note were that was a few days ago oh yeah okay  yeah oh but what are those things hawaiians wear around their necks at a luau  lays a lay i that's what his wedding is going to have in it they're going to come back from vegas  with photos of them in lays and announce that they've been married in some fly-by-night chapel  in some creepy ceremony with beverages with pineapples on them  i've never been happy and disgusted at the same time that's that's that's what's going through 
[02:24:30]  my um my head extremely happy but also very disgusted by what i uh witnessed in the last  24 hours yeah yeah yeah look at jimmy he's with me but i but but again we're very happy for  you they are a nice couple oh shut up you're you're not we are no no it's fun it's fun to watch  your friend falling in love yeah did you see him rubbing my feet on the train of course i saw it

[02:25:30]  object to us i mean i gotta be honest and now it's like a thing and now we don't know now we got to be  very respectful well you just you still recognize someone's attractive but uh you know your friend's  girl i just like watching him he was holding her feet last night too in the in the uh they were  sitting next to me to have to face forward in the car what you were watching that i couldn't not  i wasn't watching it was very dark but i just saw her feet were up on you and i saw your hand  cupping it i wasn't staring i mean he's not like the creep how am i the creep because i noticed right 
[02:26:00]  all of a sudden he's a podiatrist he's looking at us like we're all creepy it's like you can't help  but not notice but he wanted to see if i was staring at her feet that's even when you look away you're  seeing stuff that they're doing yeah you can't help it or you you just hear like  in love again oh kissing again are you good that's good i've been dumped for months but i'm  happy to see you too oh that's what i need to pick my spirits up just my two friends uh maybe i  could find a girl for you i have a little i'll bang smug guy from the 
[02:26:30]  from the cw yeah but i thought you like little churches and when i said that she reminds me of  ozzy i wasn't trashed because i dated the girl for years one of my ex-girlfriends many years ago  always reminded me of ozzy and she was a very attractive girl but from the 70s she looked like  ozzy in the paris video and i would always tell her that she never understood that i meant that  love as a compliment oh yeah but she looks like ozzy no no she was she's gonna but not a bad way  not there was a quality to her from this i used to push her hair i'm like could you just push your  hair you wanted and you wanted her to look more like i did wow that is that is kind of sick but yeah 
[02:27:00]  if you have any friends i'm sure you have hot friends yeah and i have a lot of um guy friends too so  it doesn't help what you're looking for girl yeah girl look kind of cute in that dress just  because he put the dress on i mean jimmy you know he likes girls yeah you know oh yeah yeah  i'll keep my eye open we can do like a double date type of thing oh so i might have somebody for  that already really yeah possibly yeah really well that would be nice a couple of power couples out
