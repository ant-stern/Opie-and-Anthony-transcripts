<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious rant against New York's new gun control legislation. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton used highly offensive language, filled with misogynistic and racist slurs, to vehemently criticize the law, calling it a politically motivated sham that would do little to stop crime while burdening law-abiding citizens.  They dissected the specifics of the assault weapons ban, magazine capacity limits, and the broad definition of "assault weapons," expressing concerns about registration, confiscation, and the Second Amendment's interpretation. Numerous callers shared similar frustrations and concerns, some mentioning Wyoming's attempt to circumvent federal gun control. The segment ended with continued outrage over the perceived erosion of personal freedoms.

The show then abruptly shifted to a critique of E! News's Golden Globes coverage, quickly descending into sexually explicit humor, including graphic descriptions of "Fifty Shades of Gay."  The hosts announced upcoming guests: Bob Kelly, Kevin Hart (promoting "The Real Husbands of Hollywood"), Bernard Hopkins, and introduced Eric Nagel, a filmmaker in studio, to discuss his upcoming film.  Nagel's film, featuring a 19-year-old time traveler in the 1940s (without a time machine), was the focus of much playful, inappropriate speculation and teasing from the hosts.  The discussion included copyrighting the script and many crude jokes at Nagel's expense.

Later, the show returned to a harsher critique of Nagel's (E-Rock's) movie script, focusing on its passive protagonist who observes historical tragedies like 9/11 and Columbine without intervention.  The hosts and callers used highly offensive language to deride the character and the film concept, suggesting alternative titles like "The Asshole Through Time" and debating the character's lack of growth.

Comedian Kevin Hart then joined the show, sharing anecdotes about his career, wealth, and experiences with preferential treatment and Chris Rock. The conversation veered into discussions about other comedians – Bobby Kelly, Jim Norton, and Keith Robinson – often involving vulgar jokes and stories about Keith Robinson's poor roast performance and financial issues.  Bernard Hopkins' upcoming boxing match was also briefly mentioned.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Drew Boogie's song, "I'm in Chains."

A subsequent segment tackled the challenges of health insurance in the entertainment industry, with a caller detailing the high cost of SAG and AFTRA insurance. The discussion devolved into vulgar comparisons between entertainers' lives and those in traditional jobs, including the mocking of a fictional sitcom idea, "Regular Joe."  Anecdotes about past jobs, filled with profanity and humor, were shared.  Bernard Hopkins then appeared, discussing his career, disciplined lifestyle, past incarceration, upcoming fight at the Barclays Center, plans for a Joe Frazier statue, and future business ventures.  The segment ended with promotion of Hopkins’ fight.

The final segment was a chaotic mix of conversations.  Bobby Kelly promoted his shows and podcast, followed by more joking about E-Rock's movie.  A caller's frustration with New York gun control laws was briefly discussed, along with another mention of Bernard Hopkins.  The conversation included a long, vulgar discussion about a caller's marital problems and desire for a gun, filled with racial slurs and misogynistic language, and a discussion about hats and racial stereotypes.  Jimmy Norton called in to promote his shows.  Sam Roberts and Bobby Kelly discussed engagement rings and a Steven Singer Jewelers commercial.  Tension between staff members Eric and Sal was apparent.  Madison from First Wave Alt Nation joined, leading to overlapping conversations and jokes about various topics, including Madison's child and The Rock. The conversation circled back to E-Rock's movie. The show concluded with further promotion of Bobby Kelly's shows.  The overall tone throughout the entire broadcast remained highly informal, vulgar, and digressive.

I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, the open Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking like cock and balls. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest net ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  With Opie the destroyer. 
[00:04:30]  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony the rage.  Yeah, yeah.  Your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy on the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass.  It makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful.  But I just can't take them.  This is the Opie Anthony Show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why doesn't this sound loud enough?  Could you turn up the, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Thank you.  That's good.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning.  Good fucking morning.  Man, am I one annoyed motherfucker today. 
[00:05:30]  I am annoyed.  Most people don't care, I guess.  Because, uh, you know, they just skip through life with their shoelaces untied.  Not worrying about our rights.  I am so fucking annoyed at this legislation that's going in place in New York State.  This new, the strictest, toughest gun legislation in the country. 
[00:06:00]  Mario fucking Cuomo, whatever his name is, Junior.  I have no idea.  That motherfucker.  And everyone else in this state, this knee-jerk fucking do nothing, do nothing as far as crime  goes legislation.  I don't even know what I have to do anymore.  Apparently, last night around midnight, when everyone's snoozing, they passed legislation  for this assault weapon ban. 
[00:06:30]  All right.  Ooh, you motherfucker.  When everyone snoozes, real fucking nice.  I was able to fucking start reading this legislation when it was being voted on.  They never put this shit out for the people to read before it gets voted on.  We are fucked as a nation, people.  Fucked.  This government does not work for us anymore. 
[00:07:00]  It's all about them enslaving us.  Try not to pay your taxes.  Don't jack them up as high as they want.  Try not paying them.  You know what happens?  You fucking go to jail.  There's no opt-out.  You don't have a choice.  There's no choices.  Go against anything they put in place, whether you like it or not, and you'll go to jail.  That's freedom.  Fuck this place.  Ugh.  So they put in place this legislation, this fucking assault weapons ban. 
[00:07:30]  Very needed.  Shit.  Ugh.  It's not, Jimmy.  It's not going to do anything as far as crime goes, as far as protecting the people, safety.  Nothing.  This will do nothing.  Did you see that savage beast that was in the backseat of a fucking town car that shot  the driver three times? 
[00:08:00]  It was in the news yesterday.  There was a picture of him.  Hoodies up, yo!  There he was in the backseat.  Hoodies up!  Hoodies up with his revolver in his hand.  Shooting a fucking driver.  Three rounds out of a revolver.  That's all it takes.  And that's the majority of the crime that's going on.  This feel-good bullshit.  Get re-elected.  Cuomo using it so he could run for president.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  And that's what's going on.  So now there's this assault weapons ban where I don't even know what the fuck I gotta do! 
[00:08:30]  I own a fuckload of assault weapons!  Does that make you feel good out there?  Do you have a lot of assault weapons?  Yes!  You're making a very good case.  I know!  All right, look.  I'm angry.  I'm not crazy.  But I'm very mad.  I'm very mad at this.  Because again,  me, one of the highest tax-paying fucking saps in this state and in this country, 
[00:09:00]  is being fucked over.  Now I gotta pay,  and I'm responsible  for other people's fuck-ups  and bullshit.  I own assault weapons,  which classified assault weapons.  They're not.  They're semi-automatic rifles.  Stop.  Stop it already.  So what does the legislation say?  As far as I know right now,  any semi-automatic rifle 
[00:09:30]  with a detachable magazine  and a pistol grip type grip.  So it means any gun that doesn't have,  you know,  the old wooden shoulder stock  without a hand grip on it  and plus  one military-style  accessory,  which means,  you know,  a fucking  optics rail  or the thing that keeps the barrel  from heating up  so you can fucking hold it  in the front  or a muzzle suppressor,  flash, 
[00:10:00]  but not a silencer,  a flash suppressor,  a bayonet lug  just in case you want to go into a bodega  and bayonet charge  the guy behind the counter  to rob him.  Oh boy,  that happens all the time.  Are you for or against the legislation?  That's a fair question.  That's pretty funny.  You fucking asshole.  I know his name is Andrew Cuomo.  Leave me alone.  But he's Mario Jr. to me.  Another fucking lib cocksucker.  So now, 
[00:10:30]  they're limiting magazines also  to seven rounds  instead of the ten which it was  and the thirty that it was  if I have a pre-ban,  pre-assault weapons ban  from 1994 magazine.  It's thirty rounds.  Now I don't know what the fuck  even to do with those.  Get rid of them.  Do I throw them out?  Do I get arrested  if they find them  in my garbage pail?  Do I have to destroy them?  Do I have to take them down 
[00:11:00]  to the fucking precinct  and pay twenty dollars each  to have them fucking  registered and destroyed?  More money that's gonna come  out of my fucking pocket  for doing nothing.  For being a law-abiding citizen  that walked the line,  that towed the line.  I'm not the savages.  And I gotta register  all of my assault weapons  within a year.  I don't even know  what that means.  When I bought them,  I filled out a fuckload  of paperwork. 
[00:11:30]  It went to the government.  It went to state.  They know I own them already.  I had to get a security check  every time,  a background check  every time I bought one.  It's already there.  It's already there.  I already did it.  Stop it already.  What are my pistols?  What do I do?  No, I don't.  My MP5 fucking  semi-automatic MP5.  What is that?  Is there a pistol?  Is there a rifle?  30-round mag on that?  7-round mag?  They don't make them. 
[00:12:00]  10-round mag?  I have one,  but I can get you.  This whole opening  sounds like the opening  to a film,  and we pull back,  we realize you're alone  in a room.  Just fucking,  and your hands are  cuffed behind your back  and you're just screaming.  I don't know  what this is.  I know one thing.  It's not going to do  anything to curb crime  or to make people safer.  Nothing.  Ammunition?  What? 
[00:12:30]  Buy over a certain amount?  They're going to what?  Get in touch with me?  Is that what it is?  Sure.  Yeah.  How many rounds?  How many rounds?  I think after three rounds.  Three rounds.  You don't need more than three.  That's good.  Suspicious amount.  Handgun and assault rifle owners  will require to  recertify their permits  every five years.  Well, I have to recertify  my pistol permit  every five years anyway.  Now everything.  Well, now everything.  But I don't have a permit  for rifles because  they're not,  you don't have to have  a permit for rifles. 
[00:13:00]  Probably now.  You should.  Well, this is great  because I'm sure  this is all free of charge.  I'm sure when you go  to the precinct  with your various rifles  and whatnot  that they're just going  to be like,  all right, hey,  bring them in, people.  We'll just, you know,  pay these officers  to chalk up  the fucking multitude  of people here  that have assault weapons  in New York State.  Free of charge.  No.  More money  that's going to be sapped,  leeched 
[00:13:30]  from the law-abiding citizens  that are exercising  their Second Amendment right  will now be fucked  in the ass  again.  Again.  Oh, my fucking God.  And this is,  this is before  even the federal shit  starts with,  with Blobama.  Because he's going  to get in there,  as he said  in his press conference.  And, you know,  if Congress  doesn't want to work  with him, 
[00:14:00]  he's just going  to sign off  on whatever  the fuck he pleases.  Like he's done  with everything else.  Ah, whatever.  I'm just going  to use my  executive privilege  here  and sign off  on shit.  I am disgusted.  You all deserve it,  you fucking sheep.  You all deserve it.  Good.  God,  do I hope  in 2050,  100 years,  whatever it may be,  this fucking government  just tries  fucking you  even worse  for something 
[00:14:30]  you want  and you turn around  and go,  what do I do?  All our guns  are gone.  They allowed me  a pea shooter  and a fucking  wrist rocket.  Like,  let's just say  that they wanted  to limit the  purchase of ice cream.  That's what  regular people  would be  irritated about.  Exactly.  All the fat  sows out there.  All you fat  fucking pigs  out there.  my ice cream.  This is my right  to eat my ice cream. 
[00:15:00]  Well,  you're still  allowed vanilla.  We're not infringing  on your right  to eat ice cream.  We just think  there should be  reasonable restrictions  so you can have vanilla.  And if you have chocolate,  it must be registered  with Haagen-Dazs  every five years.  But  strawberry's  out of the question.  No Rocky Road?  No Rocky Road!  That's a salt ice cream.  What am I gonna do?  I have no idea  what to do. 
[00:15:30]  I got a  fucking safe  full of guns!  Is Texas  looking better?  I swear to you,  if I did not  own a wonderful  house  that I'm paying  a mortgage on  and I've put  a lot of work  and effort into  before New York  really started  fucking people,  I would move  to Pennsylvania  and commute.  I would  abso-fucking-lutely  move right over  the little border  from Jersey  or whatever 
[00:16:00]  and live in  Pennsylvania  and fucking  commute  because I've  had it with this  state.  The taxes  I'm paying  are astronomical.  They go up  every fucking year  and every right  I have  goes down  every year.  This is  an abomination.  The government  of the people  for the  fuck you!  It is not  abomination.  It's an abomination. 
[00:16:30]  And now  I'm  seven round  magazines.  Where?  Where do you  get that?  That's a freak  number.  What are you  doing?  Where do I  get a seven  round mag?  They'll probably  make them.  They'll be  a brand new  business.  They know  that there  would be  a big  outcry  if they  just wanted  you to have  five round  mags.  They make  five round  magazines.  They make  ten round 
[00:17:00]  magazines.  They make  twenty round  magazines.  They make  thirty round  magazines.  No, they  don't make  a seven  round  magazine.  So now  they know  that if  ten round  magazines are  illegal and  you say  seven round  mags, you're  going to have  to go to  a five round  mag.  So this in  essence is a  five round  magazine law.  They don't  make seven  round mags.  Five will be  enough though.  Yeah, more  than enough.  Oh, watch  me.  I will load  up a thousand  five round  magazines.  Just out of 
[00:17:30]  spite.  Just out of  spite.  I'm going  to go to  the range  and make  a video of  me firing  off five  round mags,  dropping the  mag, throwing  another one  in, and  just railing  off round  after round  and watch  what it does.  It'll do  nothing.  And that's  for someone  that wants  to commit  a crime but  wants to  adhere to the  five round  magazine law.  No one's  going to do  that.  Probably get  you on a  watch list  or something.  That's right.  You can buy  thirty round  mags in  other states,  in other 
[00:18:00]  countries, and  illegally have  them mailed  to you.  Because if  you're going to  commit a  fucking crime,  you don't  give a shit.  How do you  get them to  mail it to  you, though?  You fucking  go online.  How won't  they get in  trouble for  mailing it  across state  lines?  No, they  don't give a  shit.  Or out of  the country.  Look, I'm  fucking sending  from Mexico.  I'm going to  order from  Mexico and  order thirty  round mags,  and then they'll  come across  state line where  all of a sudden  it becomes a  class D felony.  But what do 
[00:18:30]  you think a guy  that wants to  fucking shoot up  anything with  thirty rounds at  a clip is going  to give a shit  that he's got a  class D felony  for a fucking  thirty round mag?  That's why I'm  saying this will  do nothing.  I wonder if  you'll be banned  from going to  those websites  because one of  the other things  is no internet  ammunition.  Oh, well, I  guess.  Well, because  that's fucking  well, that'll  get him.  That'll get  him.  Like gambling.  That's right.  This does  Napster.  Nothing.  Nothing.  This will do 
[00:19:00]  nothing.  It's to make  Cuomo look like  he's doing  something so he  can run for  president.  It's to get  more revenue  out of the  people that  are actually  the law  abiding  citizens that  are exercising  their Second  Amendment right.  That's what  this is about.  This isn't  really about  safety.  First of all,  rifles aren't  used in crime.  They're not  fucking used in  crimes.  In this  state, in  this country,  it's something  like 300  rifle deaths a  year in this  country. 
[00:19:30]  Some of those  aren't murders.  They're not  fucking, you  know, they're  rifle deaths.  Out of that,  in New York  State, how  many are used  and how many  are considered  assault rifles?  This state,  it's pistols  and it's  fucking an  average of  three rounds  are used in  the commission  of crimes  where guns  are used and  fired.  three rounds.  What does that  mean?  That means the  seven is too  many.  The government's  being too lean 
[00:20:00]  with these  seven magazines.  You're right.  And those  five round  clips will be  more than  enough.  Absolutely.  They should  make it  three.  Three round  clips.  No one  walks around  with an  AK-47 or  an AR-15  and robs a  place or  lights up a  fucking cab  driver or  anything like  that.  It's just  not done.  You have  the occasional  nut that  shoots up  schools or  fucking  malls or  anything like  that, but  they're not  going to  adhere to 
[00:20:30]  these rules.  Believe me.  This shit  will still  happen.  And when it  still happens  after they've  put this  legislation  through,  they'll put  more legislation  through.  And it  still won't  do anything  until they've  reached their  goal, which  is, by the  way, disarming  the American  people, disarming  them, to have  this European  fuckwad  government in  this country  that these  liberal Democrat  cocksuckers 
[00:21:00]  want.  And even the  Republicans in  New York have  fucking given  up and sucked  their Democrats  cocks so they  could get  re-elected.  Because the  media has just  completely bamboozled  New York and  the American  people on what  these guns  are.  Had it.  Well, welcome  to the show.  Hey, look at  the phones. 
[00:21:30]  They're all lit  up.  We never take  calls.  Why not?  Let's just go  down from line  one.  I don't care.  All right,  Jimmy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Oh, Jim, not  you.  Jimmy, what's  up, my friend?  Hey, what's  up, boys?  Nice to take  my call.  I normally  don't take  them.  But do they  really think  the fucking  gangbangers  are going to  sit online,  go to the  precinct, and  hand their  guns in and  get the proper  permits?  No.  Guys like you  and I that are  going to do  that.  So what the  fuck is it  going to do?  Like you've  been saying  all morning to  help America?  It's going to  do nothing. 
[00:22:00]  Cocaine's  illegal, but I'm  going to do a  hell of a lot of  it this weekend.  There you go.  If I want it,  we're going to get  it.  There's already  laws against  things, and  they're still out  there, and  they're still  brought in.  The people  they're targeting  though are not  gangbangers on  this one.  This is not  about gangbangers.  No, it's about  people that are  even less inclined  to kill people  than gangbangers.  No, but it's  about people who  do, they don't  give a fuck about  that type of  street crime.  They're not going  to go this crazy  for that kind of  street crime.  This is because  when it's happening, 
[00:22:30]  and I understand  why people are  suburban schools,  and again, those  are white guy  crimes.  This is targeting  the possible  white guy.  They're not  looking at  ghetto crimes or  fucking gangbangers.  That's not what  they're doing with  this.  Well, they are  still going to  get their hands  on whatever they  need to kill a  lot of people if  that's what they're  inclined to do.  Whether it's a  gun, whether it's  a fucking propane  canister with  flares tied to it,  whether it's a  car driving through  a fucking playground,  they're still going 
[00:23:00]  to be able to do  what they're  inclined to do  because they're  crazy people, and  they're not adhering  to the laws.  It's going to  do nothing.  Guys like you,  me, it's going  to be horrible  for us.  Nothing.  Horrible.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Have a good  day.  Bye-bye.  Eric in  Colorado.  Eric in  Colorado, my  good friend.  How are you,  sir?  Hello, Mr.  Anthony.  Hi.  Hey, on  January 2nd, the  state of Wyoming  introduced legislation,  I believe it's  House Bill 1040, 
[00:23:30]  that will make it  illegal for any  law enforcement  personnel in the  state of Wyoming  to enforce any  federal assault  weapon ban.  Yeah, I saw  that.  Yeah, the officer  can lose his job,  be fined, and go  to jail for  enforcing it.  Yeah, that will  go to court,  though.  And, um...  I don't know.  Is it the state  or is it federal  that's more  powerful?  Exactly.  The federal  government's  going to step  in.  Wyoming has a  history of  telling the  federal government 
[00:24:00]  to go fuck  themselves.  So does  Texas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, uh...  I'm seriously  contemplating relocating  to, uh, uh, the  90 miles north to  Wyoming.  Yeah, I hear you.  All right, thanks,  man.  Don't panic, sir.  I'm so panicked.  Uh, what do we got  here?  Uh, good old Frank.  Frank, oh, Frank  was better.  Frank, North Carolina.  Hey, Anthony.  Oh, man, I moved  out of New York.  I'm from Smithtown  originally.  Oh, yeah?  I moved out of New  York in 2004, and I  am loving it.  I bet. 
[00:24:30]  North Carolina.  I got a gun show  I'm going to this  weekend to buy up  the last of what I  need.  I mean, I can get a  silencer if I want  over here.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  What are you going  to use that for?  I'm a law-abiding  citizen.  I own a business.  And, uh, you know,  we have protection  laws over here.  Somebody is in my  driveway, and I feel  threatened, and I  shoot the shit out of  them.  There's no questions  asked.  They were on my  property.  I'm sure there's a few  questions that'll be  asked, sir.  I'm sure there's a few  questions that the  police might want to  know who the gentleman  is and what he was  doing.  Yeah, what if it was 
[00:25:00]  just somebody lost, and  they were going to  knock on your door  because they needed to  use the phone?  They might ask that  question.  You're home as  witness.  All right, Frank.  Enough of you.  Jesus Christ, you're  a crazy person.  Tom in Belmore.  Tom!  Yeah, it's Anthony.  How?  Good morning.  How are you guys?  Hi, hi, sir.  I live in Belmore.  I own a Sega 12.  I have four five-round  clips and two ten-round  clips.  Now, what the hell do I  do with my Sega 12?  I think you get rid of  your fucking ten-round 
[00:25:30]  clips.  You keep your fives and  register your fucking  weapon.  That's right.  I don't even know who  I'm supposed to register  this with.  Well, the other question  I have, if you don't  mind, is I have an SKS,  which is an older version  with a ten-round  detachable clip.  It doesn't detach, and  a thirty-round detachable  clip.  I think it doesn't matter  from what I read so far,  and I haven't read through  it really well, but I  think it's detachable and  non-detachable mags if  they're ten rounds.  I don't know. 
[00:26:00]  I don't know.  This shit, they all  slid it past everyone in  the wee hours of the  fucking morning.  What kind of a fuck?  What kind of shit is  that?  I mean, at least be  open and honest with  the people.  Cocksuckers.  Just to show you where  the government in New  York is going and how  many rights are going to  be taken away even more  so.  Exactly.  You know what?  Just fucking keep  feeding into the  savages, and the actual  people that produce and  pay attention to the  laws get bent over and  fucked in the ass.  Wonderful. 
[00:26:30]  You know, the big  question is why isn't  anybody addressing the  black folk culture?  Because that's not what  this one, dude, that's  not what this one is  about.  No.  This is, it's weird.  Hold on, hold on.  It's not what it's  about.  They react harshly like  this when it's white  people's lives.  They really do.  310 people in Chicago  alone were killed in  shootings, and no one  said a fucking word.  The government does not 
[00:27:00]  react this harshly to  fucking gangbanger  deaths.  They just don't.  20 kids and teachers  get shot, and all of a  sudden, now they're going  to do something.  Exactly.  But that's what it's  about.  Right, what you said  before, Anthony, though,  it's not an assault  rifle, and an assault  rifle has a selector  switch.  Yeah, exactly.  But, you know, the  media...  They've got to get  their information  correctly.  The Democratic, the  liberals, and the media  have just fed into the  people's perception of  what this assault weapon  is.  Most people honestly 
[00:27:30]  think it's a fully  automatic machine gun  that you can buy at  any Walmart.  You walk in, and you  buy a machine gun, and  there's no check, there's  no nothing.  You just start shooting  like crazy.  Oh, I don't agree with  that.  That's very dangerous.  That isn't it.  I've got to go, but I  don't know.  Well, good.  Well, good.  You go.  You go.  Yes.  Does it only take 10  round mags?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm...  I'm... 
[00:28:00]  Yes, yes.  What's up, my friend?  Nick.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey, man.  So, this is the thing.  They make guns.  Like, for instance,  there's a certain type  of AK-47 that'll only  accept a single stack  or a 10-round mags.  Right.  That was made to work  in accordance with  California and New York.  Right.  Places that had these  stupid bands that I  disagree with anyway.  So, my first question  is, for people that  have those, are those  people going to get  fucked and have to pay  more taxes on those?  Yes.  Probably.  But, hey, here's the  bigger issue, and this 
[00:28:30]  is why, Paul, we all  agree Obama sucks, or  most of us do, thankfully,  and not because Fox  said so, but even the  liberal channels are  starting to catch on.  My point is that this  guy openly went out  there and said, I'm  going to circumvent  Congress again.  Yeah.  Isn't that grounds to  try the guy for  impeachment?  No.  And then you don't  just fucking impeach  a president.  You try him for it.  Because the truth of  the matter is, no,  because the truth of  the matter is, George  W. used as much  executive privilege as  Obama is using. 
[00:29:00]  He actually, yeah, he  used just as much as  Obama's using, but it's  what Obama's using it  for that gets me.  He's using it to  circumvent the fucking  Constitution.  Well, I agree.  Obama and Bush are the  same guy.  They're just on the  completely opposite ends  of the...  But they're doing the  same thing.  You know, whatever you  were pissed at George  W. for doing, Obama's  doing the same thing.  Well, that's why his  signature looks like a  penis ejaculating, because  the guy's a fucking  jerk-off.  That's all I've got to 
[00:29:30]  say about it.  Hey, thanks for  taking my point.  Oh, right, my good  friend.  I don't know.  I have a gun that will  not even accept a five  round magazine or a  ten round mag.  It, like, jams up in  there.  It's meant to accept a  nice long AR-15 30  round mag or even a  ten round mag.  But, you know, what is  that going to do?  Is there going to be  some kind of a block you  could put in there?  I don't think so.  I'm going to...  This...  People read this, and  if you don't know  anything about guns, you 
[00:30:00]  go, oh, okay, that's  sounds good.  That sounds reasonable.  The second you know  anything about firearms  and own them and  stuff, you realize it's  very intrusive.  It's purposefully  written to keep you  from owning certain  types of guns and  magazines and shit  like that.  But it sounds like,  well, we're doing a  great job of limiting  guns to people that  shouldn't have them.  It's just horse shit.  They're just trying to  cut down on the ability  of people to walk.  I mean, it's, again,  it's a placebo.  But they're not. 
[00:30:30]  It's not going to do  anything.  But that's...  It's either that or  take them all away.  There's not much you  can...  There's really not  much you can do.  This is the problem.  This guy is dead.  Uh-huh.  He shot himself.  There's not much you  can do.  So the country is  running around like a  bunch of fucking angry  bees because we want to  lash out and do  something because that  was such a fucking...  That one was the worst  one I can remember in my  lifetime.  Yeah, of course.  That was the worst  one.  Well, that's why this  knee-jerk reaction and  this band-aid that 
[00:31:00]  people need to feel  good about themselves  like they're doing  something and to use  it politically.  Abso-fucking-lutely to  use dead children as a  political tool to  fucking get re-elected  in the midterm  elections or to run  for president in four  years.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  And they saw a  perfect opportunity to  do that with this  useless gun legislation  that does nothing but  take away, infringe upon 
[00:31:30]  the right of the people  to bear arms.  Does this go farther  than you thought it  would or not as far?  Further than I  thought.  It absolutely goes  further than I  thought.  It redefines an  assault weapon, makes  it even tougher than  the 94 assault weapons  ban that Clinton put in  place.  Now it's any gun that  isn't just your  granddad's fucking  rifle, hunting rifle.  It's amazing.  And these are  cosmetics. 
[00:32:00]  These rifles that  they're banning, it's  simple cosmetics.  They don't like the  plastic attachments that  go over the barrel.  They don't like the  pistol hand grip behind  the trigger.  That's what it is.  It has nothing to do  with the functionality of  a semi-automatic rifle.  Any nut could take  their dad's or the  granddad's shotgun or  their fucking dad's  or granddad's fucking  semi-automatic 223 rifle 
[00:32:30]  and do the same damage.  You know?  Pop in an illegal  magazine because,  again, they're not  going to care about  the magazine if they're  going to murder people  and go to town.  But the second you  start putting attachments  on it that make it  look like the weapons  that are used in the  military, it now  becomes this thing.  They're no different.  They are no different.  They are semi-automatic  rifles.  As fast as you pull  the trigger, bullets  fly out the barrel. 
[00:33:00]  Regardless if it's a  wooden fucking rifle  that is used for  hunting or a plastic  assault weapon.  Same gun.  But people don't think  that.  They think it's,  they think an assault  weapon is this gun that  is used in the wars and  they're fully automatic  and they fire these  amazingly powerful  bullets.  It's the same gun.  So what do people do?  And I mean, like,  what are, and I don't  mean we, like, what is,  what are people supposed  to do?  Because this, again,  this is not about  street crime. 
[00:33:30]  The government will  talk about street crime  and they'll say it.  The way they react to  something like this  compared to all those  dead in Chicago, they  don't really give a fuck  about gangbangers.  They say they do and  they care a little, but  you can't motivate the  entire government to  move with, I don't  care how many gang  banger killings there  are.  Exactly.  You never get the  entire government to  move like this.  I don't care if the  president's black, he's  a Republican, none of  it means a fucking  thing.  This gets everybody  moving.  Exactly. 
[00:34:00]  So it's going after  the people like you're  talking about.  It's not going after  the fucking thugs.  Now the thugs are  killing the thugs.  Oh, they'll just keep  killing each other and  they don't care.  Right.  They'll still be well  over 300 gun deaths  in your major cities.  And it'll be black  on black crime, of  course.  Right.  So this is not what  that's about.  So to go after the  to target what they're  doing here, which is  the accessibility of  certain guns to that  crazy element, which  most people are not.  But that look, it's  happened too many  times. 
[00:34:30]  So what what's the  what's the logical  step?  I you could say one  time is too many  times.  But I mean, it's  happened a lot.  No, statistically, it's  it's very small.  But I understand I'm  not saying, oh, it's  very small.  People tell that to  the parents.  No, I understand.  It's horrible.  It's tragic.  But statistically, it's  very small.  And when you have a  country with this  many people in it and  there is a freedom  and a right to bear  arms in this country, 
[00:35:00]  you're going to get  people that will use  them for horrible  things.  And unless you want  to take away all of  them, it's not going to  do anything.  It's it is an all or  nothing thing.  And if you took away  all of them, there'd  still be an influx of  illegal weapons that bad  people would still use.  Occasionally, someone's  going to fucking get on  a highway and drive the  wrong way, no matter how  many signs say wrong way.  It's just going to  happen.  I'm sorry.  It's just going to  fucking happen.  This is not a perfect 
[00:35:30]  world we live in where  you can prevent horrible  things from happening.  It's just impossible.  But people aren't  people aren't going to  accept that.  I know.  So they make  inane laws that will  do nothing except  prevent us from  exercising our rights.  How many people would  you think you're saying  statistically it's low?  How many people own  real hardcore assault  weapons?  I don't know the exact  number.  I mean, I can estimate  that out of the 300  million guns that are in  this country, it's 
[00:36:00]  probably I would  probably say a  quarter of that.  So 75 million?  At least.  So how many people do  you think own them?  Um, probably less than  that because a lot of  people own multiple  guns.  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  I'd say.  Uh, so I mean, so how  many are actually used  in, in the commission of  these mass killings as  opposed to the amount  that's out there and the 
[00:36:30]  amount of people that have  them that aren't doing  this?  It's just, you know  what it is?  It happens.  We're so used to it.  We're so used to it that  this one registers, but  like the four firemen that  were killed, what were  they killed up in?  Yeah.  Uh, not, what was it?  It was upstate?  Yeah.  It was like a Buffalo  somewhere in Buffalo.  Yeah.  I mean, like it just  happens.  We, we, we kind of tune  it out.  Like this one again, you  notice, but we don't  notice all the times it  happens.  Not even with, again,  not fucking talking  gang killing, just these  weird psychopaths who  kill their families and go 
[00:37:00]  out and kill a couple  caught, people just had  enough.  And I know that the NRA  doesn't bend.  I saw LaPierre's speech.  They had a chance to at  least get people, fuck  that.  I'm glad the NRA doesn't  bend.  I'm glad.  You know why?  Because it doesn't matter  what the fucking NRA does.  They are, the government is  going to do whatever the  fuck they want to do for,  to better their position in  an election and to appease  the, the, the masses, uh,  with disinformation and  horrible, uh, useless  legislation. 
[00:37:30]  But they're scared of the  NRA.  All of them are.  Not anymore.  They have too many people.  The NRA is gimpy.  They're fucking, they  aren't, they have no power  right now.  They've, the media has  undermined everything about  the second amendment and,  uh, made the NRA through no  fault of, you know, uh, their  own because the NRA looked  stupid too.  Terrible.  Yeah.  Well, they've never had to  deal with a situation like  this.  And when the media is  pounding you and making you  look like the villain, you're  the villain.  I, but I, but I'm, I'm, I'm  fucking rational and I 
[00:38:00]  watched that guy and I, I  wanted to like what he  said.  I really did.  I did too.  I was, I was naive and I  watched him and I was like,  you fuck.  I didn't like what he said  either, Jimmy.  Yeah.  But I'm, whether they bend or  not, if they bend, they would  take even more.  They want an open dialogue with  this and that.  No, they don't.  They're going to do whatever  the fuck they want.  The government is going to  fuck you and do whatever the  fuck they want.  Like I said, you think you're  free in this state or that  you're in or, or the country? 
[00:38:30]  You're not.  Go do something you want to  do.  Go ahead.  Go hunting.  Go hunting, uh, for a deer to  feed your family right now.  Oh, it's not deer season.  Oh, you didn't buy your tags.  Oh, you're using a fucking  weapon.  You're not supposed to be  using, uh, go fishing  somewhere.  You want to fish to feed your  family?  Oh, you don't have a fucking  license.  You're in a place that's  restricted.  You don't have these freedoms.  You own a house.  No, you don't.  You're renting that fucking  property from the government.  Try not paying your property 
[00:39:00]  taxes.  They'll take your fucking house  away.  You can't just not, you can't  just work, get what you want  and then decide you want to  just settle down and live with  what you've accumulated over  your lifetime of working.  Because until you drop fucking  dead, you still have to pay the  government for that plot of land  you're on and all the shit you  have and the shit you want to  buy and the food you're buying,  you still got to pay through the  fucking nose.  And again, don't and you'll go to  jail or have your shit taken away. 
[00:39:30]  We do pay too much.  But, you know, the advantage is if  there's a fire, somebody will show  up usually.  Exactly.  But it's it's a balancing act  and and it's swung way the other  way.  We're fucked with our freedoms.  We are not free.  We live in a free country.  No, you don't.  You don't live in a free country.  You're fucked at every turn.  At every turn.  Unless you want to walk somewhere,  unless you want to walk from point  A to point B, you have to follow so 
[00:40:00]  many rules or else you'll at least  get ticketed or you might go to  jail.  You can't even ride a bike on  certain places to get from point  A to point B.  How is that free?  I mean, I understand restrictions.  I understand.  I'm not saying there shouldn't be  certain restrictions, but don't  don't get this delusion that you're  free to do whatever the fuck you  want in this country.  There's restrictions on everything.  What restrictions would you be for  on on guns, on guns,  background checks for everybody. 
[00:40:30]  I fucking have no problem with that.  Now, has the NRA fought that?  In certain instances, they have  fought for the state's rights to  implement whatever restriction or  lack thereof they want.  So they are defending.  They're not saying I'm against  background checks because if a state  wants to implement background checks,  that's fine.  But they are not for the government  saying you have to.  So they will defend the state's 
[00:41:00]  rights to not have background  checks.  I, on the other hand, would love  background checks for everybody.  Okay.  That's that's one place where they  could have.  That's a place where they hurt  themselves because then people hear  that.  And again, I want you to be able to  own your guns.  I don't care.  But then I look at them and I'm  like, well, fuck that.  You know what?  Fuck.  Because I'm looked at.  They're that unreasonable.  If they if they like I don't want  anybody to be.  I don't give a fuck if they're from  Pennsylvania.  Again, you know, people could get  anywhere they need to get very  quickly. 
[00:41:30]  When the Constitution was written,  you couldn't hop in a car and  fucking go shoot somebody across  state lines in 20 minutes or an  hour.  You know, you had to what would  they have back in the fucking  1700s?  A horse, I think.  Exactly.  Who the fuck?  How many serial killers were there  back?  Jack the Ripper's famous.  He killed six people.  Very small area for him to walk  around.  But that's that's what serial killers  did back then.  That's what that type of shit.  Yeah.  People can hop across state lines.  The whole the whole state boundary  thing doesn't mean what it used to  mean.  But states rights are one of the 
[00:42:00]  most important things.  Yes.  In this country.  That's why it's the United States  of America.  America, not just one fucking  America.  There are states that are united  as a country, but they have  individual state rights.  But we all you're right.  We all use the same military,  though.  There are certain things that  affect each other.  Right.  But I think that I think that  most people wanting a background  check on anyone buying a gun like  that is reasonable.  Well, if the NRA doesn't think 
[00:42:30]  so, fuck them and fuck any state  that doesn't want background  checks.  Fuck them.  Well, Obama is most probably  going to implement background  checks for everybody, for every  state, for every gun purchase  that's made.  I don't have a problem with that.  You know why?  Because I'm fine.  You'll pass.  I fucking am clean as a  whistle.  And I know that.  But I don't like the fact that I  keep getting more shit piled on top 
[00:43:00]  of me for stuff that I and the  majority, the vast majority of gun  owners are not doing.  We're good.  We're fucking fine.  But but whenever something happens  and the hammer falls, who gets the  dick in the ass?  Yeah.  The people that are paying  attention to the rules and don't do  anything wrong.  Do you know how impressed I would  have been with the NRA if they would  have come out when that that  cocksucker made his speech and said  something about they want further 
[00:43:30]  background checks and they tied it  in with the mental illness thing?  Uh huh.  And I would have been like, yeah,  all right, at least they're willing  to discuss things.  Nothing.  Well, but I'm just saying that's why  the reaction and and they and you  guys look you got the idea that you  lose people in the middle.  Do you honestly think if the NRA would  have capitulated on anything that they  were talking about that we that New  York would have not passed this  exact same gun legislation? 
[00:44:00]  You probably probably would have  exact same.  But what would have happened was  again, it's the tone of the country.  Everybody is so upset and frustrated  about this one.  This was a terrible one.  They misread that and they didn't  they did nothing to stop that  fucking swell like they might have  been able to, you know, it's like a  weird mentality like when when they're  going after obscenity, when there's a  conservative thing, the whole the  whole fucking tone, you can feel it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With this one.  That's what that is.  They should have read that a little  bit better. 
[00:44:30]  I'm not saying they would have stopped  New York.  I don't think it would have stopped  New York and I don't think it would  have stopped whatever the fuck Obama  is going to do with Biden's fucking  recommendations that he's that, of  course, whenever asked by the media  to comment on what Biden's  recommendations were or what the  fuck they're they're looking to do.  They don't even fucking mention it.  This this.  Would you want Biden explaining your gun  position if you were the president?  No, I wouldn't.  But I'd want somebody else that he's 
[00:45:00]  he's speaking with.  See, this is what happens.  And it's not just the gun shit.  Believe me, it's not.  Take guns out of the mix.  Whenever the government wants to fuck  you at zero hour, they fucking sign  this shit without anyone having seen  someone tweeted me this bill at  probably nine o'clock last night and  it was signed at midnight.  Working hard.  Good government.  How about you let the people read the 
[00:45:30]  fucking thing before it's voted on  like that?  It's deceptive.  It's deceptive politics.  They know they doing it on purpose  because they know it would cause  outrage.  And it's done with everything, not just  gun legislation.  It's whenever the government wants to  slide a dick in your ass, they do it  in the wee hours of the fucking  morning like that without giving you  any heads up like like Obama gave us  a little press conference and he was  asked, what is this gun legislation? 
[00:46:00]  Well, I'll tell you more about it when  I get Vice President Biden's  recommendations on it.  He knows what they are already.  Biden is just going to go surprise.  Here it is.  You don't think Biden said I don't want  to talk about that.  Yeah, Joe, what's what's the thing?  Hey, nah, do not open till Tuesday.  Oh, he knows.  And he could have fucking spoken about  it.  But this is one of the least transparent  governments I've ever seen.  Administrations I've ever seen.  And the government on the whole is just  fucking horribly. 
[00:46:30]  There's a horrible lack of transparency  because they slip this shit by you.  So there's a bunch of fucking fraud.  Sometimes some of that stuff works, though.  Like after 9-11, there was so much  everyone's like, oh, there's all this  paranoia.  And they did kind of use it to do some  shit that's all right.  Maybe a little bit questionable.  But when you look at it, all that  craziness, there has not been and this is  not going to happen here, but there's not  been one terrorist attack here since  then.  Yeah, something something with all that 
[00:47:00]  craziness, the whole paranoia of the  country, something worked.  There was something that worked in that  crackdown.  At that point, when people were fucking  fed up, something, I mean, literally, I'm  not saying it won't happen again, but  it's been 12 years and there has not  been one attack on American soil.  And this will not work 100% like that.  But this might do something.  I mean, it might, like you said, you'll  never know how many people an actual  gunman saves when he shoots a bad guy.  You won't know how many people this 
[00:47:30]  might actually, but sometimes it does  work.  And in the other case, it did work in  the other way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just don't know.  I really get pissed when I just see  some of my rights being taken away.  Yeah.  When I'm paying through the fucking nose  taxes and everything.  I just feel like I'm being fucked and I'm  paying for it.  This country, like I said, it's the lack  of freedoms we have. 
[00:48:00]  And every year it gets worse and worse  with local politicians, state level,  federal government.  They just pile on these laws, these new  laws that wind up costing you fucking  money and costing you your freedoms.  You're not allowed to do shit anymore.  It's amazing.  You're one of the few guys that will be  able, guys who are like, who make money  and who, who, who shits in order, who  this is going to be an inconvenience to  and annoying.  Yeah, but you're not going to lose 
[00:48:30]  anything.  In time, you do lose something.  And, and yeah.  Oh, believe me, I will go.  I'll fucking get my goddamn guns  registered.  I'm going to go through all the hoops and  there are going to be people that aren't  going to go through the hoops and  register their shit.  There'll be people that won't.  And perhaps they'll go to the range and  have to fucking have a cop next to  them.  And the cop will go, hey, what the fuck?  What's that?  Is it registered?  Is that?  And they'll go to jail for it.  Or how about the fact that, um, what if 
[00:49:00]  my guns break?  What if my fucking gun breaks?  It's out of commission, thrown away or  destroyed, and I can't buy another one.  That's it.  So eventually the supply gets whittled  down for the legal gun owner illegally.  Guaranteed.  You're going to see assault weapons  illegally coming into this country and  being bought by people that want them  illegally.  It's going to happen.  This one is not about those.  It's not going to disappear.  This one is about the legal ones that  get to the wrong place. 
[00:49:30]  And which all of them eventually.  It's a minuscule amount of crimes and  killings that are committed with those  guns.  Minuscule.  And that's where all this energy is  going towards.  To this fucking one point, uh, point  oh, five percent.  Uh, it, it, the, the amount of energy  that's going towards this assault  weapon ban, it doesn't make any  sense.  That's not where the problem is.  It's, uh, this is feel good, re-elect 
[00:50:00]  me, elect me, uh, legislation.  It's just, it's just, because again,  the guy, the guy who did it, we can't,  we, you know, we wouldn't anyway,  because we're too dumb to, to like,  I hope he made a good point about what  you should do is that guy in Colorado,  I just wish some cop would pull him  out of his cell and just put a bullet  in his head.  Just put a bullet in his head.  Stop that already with his fucking  in and out of court, talking about  what his defense is doing, and what,  just fucking shoot him.  This is the only thing we can, what  people really want to do, if we want 
[00:50:30]  to just pull these guys out of their  cells, we want to bite them.  We want to tear into them, and we  can't do that.  Why?  Because it's in the Constitution that  you can't?  Ha ha!  They're shitting all over it for  fucking, uh, people that are paying  attention to it.  How about the fucking criminal?  How about you shit on that part of the  Constitution with the right to a speedy  trial and fucking, uh, against a cruel  and, uh, inhuman punishment?  How about you fucking, uh, shit all over  that part of the Constitution and blow  this guy's head off while you're,  while you're just using the Constitution 
[00:51:00]  as your own personal toilet paper?  How about you use it, how about you use  it, uh, that part of the Constitution?  How long is the Second Amendment?  It's very short.  It is?  Yeah.  Could you print it out?  It's very short.  Not that I don't know it by hand, but I  know it pretty much by heart.  A well-regulated militia.  Yeah, that's what I was just gonna say.  Yeah.  Oh, is that militia?  Militia.  Oh.  Ooh.  Arr, hey, militia.  This guy had a speech impediment.  He meant Melissa.  I knew what you meant.  Okay.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha! 
[00:51:30]  A well-regulated militia being necessary  to the security of a free state.  The right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed.  That's the whole fucking thing.  That's it.  And it's had more people speculating  and arguing as to what it fucking means.  Is there, is there a, a second part to it  or an add-on?  That's it.  That's the Second Amendment.  It's a sentence with a few commas 
[00:52:00]  that, that freak people out.  And a lot of people say,  well, they mean the right to bear arms  if you have a well-regulated militia.  That's backwards.  The thing says,  a well-regulated militia,  comma,  being necessary to the security of a free state,  comma,  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed.  Now, if the people ever need a well-regulated militia,  which is a call to arms of the people 
[00:52:30]  to combat aggressions,  foreign or domestic,  if you need to get together a militia,  the people's right to bear arms  shall not be infringed  because in order to get together that militia,  you need an armed populace.  But is it saying,  because infringed is,  you know,  you can't hamper it.  Shall not be infringed.  So basically,  are purists looking at that,  meaning you should be able to own  any type of gun you want  without the government 
[00:53:00]  being able to say a word about it?  Well, that certainly is the rub, isn't it?  But I mean,  that's kind of what that...  Some purists say that,  but honestly,  everybody that owns a gun  is into some regulation,  restriction.  When this...  And I know,  I'm not even making the muscular argument,  but when this was written,  was there the variety of weapons  that there is now?  Yeah, a multitude of weapons.  Even during the time  of these people's lives 
[00:53:30]  before they signed this,  from the time they were kids  till the time they signed this,  they saw the evolution of weapons.  There was no doubt  in these people's minds  when they wrote that amendment  that weaponry would continue to evolve.  They knew that weaponry would evolve.  They saw it in their own lifetime.  So to think that  they thought it would stop there  and that even though  we would get these amazing weapons  that they should, you know,  not have them accessible, 
[00:54:00]  it's silly.  It's silly.  Well, even if that's what they meant,  and I'm always...  When I look at the Constitution,  I'm always like,  you got to take it  for when it was written.  And again,  I think it's a great...  It's what kind of keeps us free.  It keeps us free.  But I'm also, you know,  I don't want to have people  owning any kind of weapon they want.  I don't either.  Because it's something  they wrote fucking 200 years ago.  I know that they knew a lot.  I don't either.  But they didn't. 
[00:54:30]  They...  Because again,  they probably...  And they probably would have said,  good,  yeah,  there's going to be worse weapons.  Everybody keep your shit.  I don't think they would have sided with me.  But,  you know,  it just...  They could not have seen  the crime coming.  There's no way back then  they comprehended  this kind of fucking  barbaric crime.  I understand that.  They did not.  Back then,  they were defending their homes. 
[00:55:00]  You know,  if you fucking...  It was just a simpler time.  It was different.  They didn't have gangs  murdering each other.  They didn't have guys  walking into schools  killing 20...  That wouldn't have happened  if it did happen back then.  It was...  You know,  they probably hung the guy immediately.  Well,  yeah.  But the right isn't for...  necessarily for self-defense  or for hunting.  That,  by the way,  the hunting argument,  that was just done  back then.  You didn't need  a constitutional  amendment to hunt. 
[00:55:30]  That was known.  You were going to hunt.  Self-defense,  you didn't need it  for that either.  Government didn't have  tanks back then.  Well,  yeah,  but the right  to bear arms  is against  tyrannical government.  And it still works  because the government  isn't going to start  shooting its own people  knowing that they're armed.  You can't just walk  into people's houses  because there will be  bloodshed.  The way to combat that 
[00:56:00]  as a government  is to start shooting  its own people.  that ain't going  to happen  without a complete  collapse of America.  Right.  If the government  starts shooting  their own people,  there's going  to be trouble.  Yeah.  So,  what you have  is the ability...  It's like a standoff.  It's a standoff.  Even though they have  much better weaponry  than we have,  they don't want to use  it against the people.  But if the people  are unarmed,  they won't have to.  So now with a pen,  they could legislate  whatever they want  against the people.  This is right there  we're watching on CNN. 
[00:56:30]  It said that Biden  wants to make  gun trafficking  a federal crime.  Right.  So is it not  a federal crime right now?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  And trafficking  from where?  Between states?  I'm guessing  between states  or from other countries?  Do you disagree  with making traffic...  If someone's  illegally trafficking  guns,  do you disagree  with making that  a federal crime?  No,  it's already a crime.  You're not allowed  to bring a gun  into New York State  if it's from another state 
[00:57:00]  without it going  through proper channels.  Does the federal angle  mean that the government  can prosecute you  under...  I guess,  let's say it's a state crime  and it's a very lenient  state with guns.  Right.  You might not get  much jail time,  but if it's a federal crime,  you might get  a lot of jail time.  Maybe.  I like harsher penalties  for gun crimes.  Fuck yeah.  Make them really harsh.  That's what I like.  But,  you know,  leave me alone.  I'm being a good boy.  I'm being a good boy. 
[00:57:30]  Can you turn off  this fucking E! News,  please?  I hate it.  They're showing  the fucking  Golden Globes again.  Why?  I'm sick of it.  All right,  why don't we eat...  Each other's assholes.  Yes.  Why don't we eat  each other's assholes?  A busy show today, too.  And then we'll come back  and I promise  I'll be quiet  about this now.  Bob Kelly  will be here today.  Kevin Hart is coming.  He's promoting  that new reality show  which actually looks  really funny on BET.  What's he doing? 
[00:58:00]  It's called  The Real Husbands  of Hollywood.  I'll miss it.  Yeah, well,  I actually caught it.  I have that channel  blocked at my house.  Doing a Roots marathon.  It literally is  Kevin Hart's channel now.  Is it?  Yeah,  and he's got this  new reality show  and Bernard Hopkins  is going to be here later.  And we have a filmmaker here.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  I want to discuss  a little bit about that.  Yeah, we'll do that, too.  So, um,  we'll be right back.  New from Grody Publishing 
[00:58:30]  comes the audiobook  So Erotic  it will make you  question everything.  Damn!  That's a good book on tape.  The best-selling  cultural phenomenon  evolves just for men.  It's Fifty Shades of Gay.  The muscles inside  the deepest,  darkest part of me  clench in the most  delicious fashion.  Club Soda Kenny  takes you on a journey  you've only been to  in your deepest fantasies. 
[00:59:00]  Suck me, baby!  Millions of red-blooded men  have gotten rigid  over the excitement  of Fifty Shades  of Gay.  Bro,  I've tasted my cum?  After hearing Fifty Shades  of Gay,  I would totally be down  for tasting someone else's.  Or whatever.  I'm a quivering,  moist mess,  and he hasn't even  touched me.  I've always been a guy  that's, like,  totally into chicks  with tits and stuff  like that,  but you know what?  This book is frickin'  hot as shit.  Holy fuck, 
[00:59:30]  this is wrong,  but holy hell  is it erotic.  For the first time,  I'm sexually attracted  to something that  isn't available  at the deli counter.  My insides practically  contort with potent,  needy,  liquid desire.  Ooh,  I don't fuck guys,  man,  but I'll jack off  to this,  man.  Damn!  The experts agree  Fifty Shades of Gay  is a must listen.  Hello,  I'm Dr. Gay.  This audiobook  is a must listen  for any man  looking to further  a healthy sex life. 
[01:00:00]  I'm erect.  Fifty Shades of Gay,  if you're not  turned on now,  you will be.  Yum.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the  O.P. and Anthony Show.  Wamp.  Wamp.  Wamp.  Oh.  Hi, everybody.  We're back. 
[01:00:30]  Done with my ranting.  Had it.  Hopefully,  Drew Boogie  can make a song  out of that  first hour.  He's brilliant.  I want to hear  that I'm in Chains  song a little later.  I like that one.  I was playing it  at home,  singing along to it.  It's me.  Sounding like  a fucking mental patient.  Yeah,  not acknowledging  the lunacy  that it highlights?  No.  I just thought  it was a good tune.  Yeah,  it's catchy.  Number one hit tune. 
[01:01:00]  Exactly.  I want to address  something I heard  yesterday  on the after show  as I was driving  home.  It was very  entertained.  Of course,  the lovely and talented  Otto  of Otto and George  hung out for the  after show  with young Sam Roberts  and they were  talking.  It was very  entertaining.  And then,  I don't know how  it even got brought  up,  but we found out  we have a budding  film writer.  I think I was 
[01:01:30]  asking Iraq about  like he seems  very,  like he's reached  a point where  he's content here  and that he doesn't  seem to be  motivated to  go the extra  mile.  Like he's not  an upwards  moving guy  anymore.  Did you have any  prior knowledge  that he was doing  this?  Absolutely not.  And so I said,  I just said,  well,  what would you  do if the  show went away?  If there's no  place to move  here,  what would you  do?  Right.  And he informed  me that he had  some things he  was working on  and one of those 
[01:02:00]  was he had  recently purchased  software for  screenwriting.  Good.  He got the  software.  Did you get  final draft?  Yes.  That's what he  got.  Because he's  got the idea.  He's got his  movie.  He's got the  idea.  He's writing a  movie.  He's writing a  film.  He's writing a  film.  Now, have you  ever written a  film before?  No.  Okay.  Eric Nagel, the  movie, is coming  to theaters.  Nagel.  We don't know a  lot about it.  He's being very  mysterious. 
[01:02:30]  Very mysterious.  I listened.  You and Otto were  doing a good job  grilling him yesterday.  But there were some  questions that were  unanswered.  He doesn't have a  script yet, but part  of selling the  script will be he's  going to have to  maintain some sort  of say over who  gets cast in the  film.  That will go away,  by the way.  Soundtrack.  Yes, he wants  soundtrack.  That's written into  one.  He wants that.  And he would like a  producer credit.  He doesn't seem to  have a director, but a  writer-producer.  Writer-producer.  Well, you'd get a 
[01:03:00]  writer-credit, of  course.  Casting.  No, casting and  music.  Here's what they'll  say.  You're going to get a  writing credit.  That's what you get.  Here's your money.  Well, Jimmy, you  better hope he gets  casting privileges,  because you're going  to be cast in this  film.  I am?  I heard.  That's what I heard.  He has a role  specifically in mind  for you.  Iraq, comment?  Oh, I said that.  That's true.  All right.  Now, let's reiterate  some of the stuff I  heard yesterday.  What is this movie  about?  Yeah, I didn't really  explain that to  much.  No, you didn't. 
[01:03:30]  A little bit, though.  One of the main plot  points you did, like  where, you know, not  where, but when it  would be taking place.  Yeah.  What?  It starts in present  time.  Uh-huh.  But quickly goes  back into the end  of the 40s.  The end of the 40s.  All right.  So I know what it's  about.  Uh-huh.  It's about, it's your  life from high school  on.  I'm just kidding. 
[01:04:00]  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm not that old.  Okay, so it goes back  to the 40s.  It goes back to the  40s.  Right.  So now there's a guy,  right?  Obviously, he's at the  end of his life.  No.  No, in present day.  No.  No.  It opens in the  present.  Yeah.  How old is the guy  in the present?  Uh, 18, 19.  Oh, okay.  All right.  He's young.  And then he goes back  to the 40s?  Yeah.  Now, does he know  about the future when 
[01:04:30]  he goes back to the  40s?  Yes.  And does he have, like,  an attitude?  Like, is he a cool  guy?  Is he like Bill from  Bill and Ted?  No.  Does he introduce  things like LOL to the  40s?  OMG.  As time goes on,  he changes things in  history and makes it  his own.  Oh.  So he has...  Does he have a picture  of him and his  brother and sister  that slowly disappears?  Yeah.  He has a future  machine?  No.  A past machine? 
[01:05:00]  No.  No.  It's not a...  There's no, like,  sci-fi element to it  where, for the time  travel thing, it's just  something happens.  Oh, he just...  I'm not getting...  Okay, obviously.  He knocks his head.  And he winds up...  He knocks his head.  ...being back in this  time period.  And it goes...  And has to live the  rest of his life going  through time.  Yeah.  But with not knowing...  He has to live the  rest of his life going  through time, knowing  what he knows about  the future.  Uh-huh.  So he might start  inventing things.  Like, he probably  buys up dot-com stuff  in the 40s, 40 years 
[01:05:30]  before it means anything.  What?  Things like that.  How do you do that?  What is...  Now, he compared it  to the Jerry O'Connell  series, Sliders.  No, I didn't.  I think you did.  You did, though.  I heard that part.  I never saw that series.  It was ridiculous.  Stunk.  It's stunk.  You never want to hear  that your series is stunk.  Stunk.  I thought it was more  like Voyagers from the 80s.  Iraq.  So there's this guy. 
[01:06:00]  He's 18.  He goes back to the 40s.  Now...  Hey there, blubby.  Hey, blubby.  He goes back to the 40s  well beyond when he was born.  And does he immediately  start, like, fucking with things?  No.  What does he do first?  I don't want to give  a lot of this out  because it hasn't been finished.  God.  And he also...  I want to know...  Eric didn't want to give  the title of the movie away.  Right.  Due to copyright concerns.  He's got a title,  but he won't tell us  what it is.  I have a whole bunch of notes  and everything else. 
[01:06:30]  I just want to put it  all together  and get it copywritten  and everything.  You should do that,  but the one way,  a little cheap,  easy way to do it,  print it all out  and mail it to yourself  through the U.S. mail.  It doesn't hold up.  No?  No, you can't do that.  That doesn't work.  I've heard of that in the 90s.  That's horse shit.  And Esquire says no.  That's horse shit.  Why?  Because you have to go through  that you have to send it  to the Library of Congress.  No, no, no.  I know that,  but I'm saying as a temporary thing  while you're doing that.  It doesn't hold up.  It doesn't hold up.  It doesn't hold up a chord.  Wow.  I wonder why.  It just doesn't.  I tried doing that 
[01:07:00]  and then I called up SAG  and they were like,  no, you have to send it  to the Library of Congress.  It takes a long time  to send this back.  I had a kid fuck me  because I wrote a script  with two dudes  and one of the kids  got a little loopy  and we were like,  I had to copyright it  and I tried doing that,  but that shit didn't work.  Like the Nagel.  Yeah, my lawyer told me that.  He's a what?  He's a filmmaker.  Yeah, he's a filmmaker.  He's writing a film.  See, here's what's happening.  We found out yesterday  that Eric Nagel  is writing a film.  That's great. 
[01:07:30]  He's writing a film  and we're trying to,  he already got the software  to write the final draft.  Oh, you got to do that first  because he's not using a quill, right?  Right, right.  So now we're trying to figure out  what this is about.  So far, here's what we got.  Starts in present time,  2013-ish, around that.  19-year-old?  19, 18, 19-year-old guy.  Cool guy.  Somehow.  Without, don't fucking say  time machine  because it ain't no time machine.  Right.  But somehow,  this guy goes back  to the late 40s. 
[01:08:00]  I think he's on a boat  or something.  Maybe he's doing some fishing  and the clouds swoop down  and it's a weird...  Oh.  And all of a sudden,  he comes out  and the lake is the same.  But he can't find his car  on the lake.  Wait a minute.  Where's my car?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And he goes...  So you could do the foley work  for him.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No, he goes down,  he gets caught in a storm  and he goes down.  Oh.  And then there's a little creature 
[01:08:30]  named Chaka  come and guide him.  A bunch of slea stacks.  Yeah, slea stacks.  Eric's original idea  was that he would go  and travel through the decades.  What word did you just use?  Original idea  was that he would travel  through the decades  via time vortexes  like the Jerry O'Connell series  sliders.  That was you again.  Does he use...  You said something  about sliders yesterday.  No, you said that  and I told you.  Does he use a phone booth  to travel in time?  No.  No phone booth.  No phone booth.  You know what this show does?  Kills dreams. 
[01:09:00]  Exactly.  That's all this show does.  This show just kills.  You're right.  This show does nothing  for any of us.  Except...  You're right.  Except maybe eight people  at a fucking gig in Albany.  You're right.  Let me tell you something.  This kid has a hope.  He has a hope.  Talked to his chick.  Yeah, yeah.  He's probably one of his parents.  He talked about this.  Maybe confided in one of these assholes  when they were actually...  He talked to Roland about it.  And everybody went,  you know what?  He said you did.  Go ahead, man.  That's what you gotta do, dude.  You gotta do multiple.  You can't just do one thing 
[01:09:30]  and give him a pay.  And he went, yeah.  That's a good idea.  And he went and bought the stuff  and then he sat down one night  and cleared off the desk  and he went, honey...  I'm gonna write a move.  I bet his wife peeked in  and went, ooh.  Got excited that he's starting to do it.  Yeah.  And everybody's happy for him.  And then he comes in here  and now he's gonna...  I guarantee he's gonna go home  and fucking destroy whatever offices  in his fucking Jersey shit town.  That's not what happened, though.  Here's how he got the script writing software.  His wife got so tired 
[01:10:00]  of being married  to this fucking Lego-making lump,  she brought home Final Draft  and said,  do rights, do something.  Write a movie.  Oh, Norton, you know what?  You know what, Norton?  Your show on Wednesdays is really...  Thank God it's here.  You help people.  Because you're right.  Do something, you cocksucker.  Yeah, you stop playing Legos.  How do you expect me to get turned on by you?  You're playing Legos.  You push my movie, shit dick.  Hello?  Hello?  That's all you do all the...  Hello?  Hello?  Enough.  Here, write a movie.  And he said that, like, 
[01:10:30]  he starts in 2013.  Right, right.  Goes back to the 40s.  1940s.  And travels through the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.  It's such a shit time to go back to.  And 2000s.  In under 90 minutes.  Why would you go back to the 40s?  That's right when the fucking world sucked.  I don't think he had a choice.  Why?  I think he got thrown back somehow.  Because he doesn't have a time machine.  He stepped in a hole or something.  He would be good in the 40s.  I bet he hits his head.  The guy hits his head.  And he's like,  Oh, oh, oh.  And he's like,  Hey, what are you doing there? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Ah.  Wait a minute.  I was just.  Hi.  Hey, pal.  You fell down and hit your head.  What are you up to?  23 skidoo.  Oh, 23 skidoo.  LOL.  That's funny.  What do you mean, LOL?  Who's wrong?  Ah.  I don't understand what you're talking about.  Does he check a newspaper?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he checks a newspaper.  Sees the date.  He's like,  Oh, my God.  And he's walking through like Times Square. 
[01:11:30]  And he sees like that guy kiss the girl.  And he has that somewhere in time moment.  He's in the sign of Penny.  He pulls a hoagie out of his pocket.  And he sees the maid on date.  He's fucking.  He's in paradise because a hoagie is like 50 cents.  No, they're not even invented yet.  But some diner owner is like,  This is a great idea.  What a grand idea.  Yeah, he inadvertently invented the hoagie.  Is there food-related inventions in the film? 
[01:12:00]  You're not coming?  There's no food.  So you don't do anything with computers.  He becomes the hoagie king of Long Island.  Yes.  Yeah, he starts inventing everything.  He gets a pancake.  And someone steps on it.  And it's the waffle.  Oh, my God.  What are you going to do?  They're not all winners.  It's like,  Oh, wait a minute.  I dropped my iPhone.  iPhone?  What about your phone?  Or my phone?  What are you talking about iPhone?  What is this?  You've got to use the phone.  There's one in there.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  I have to check Twitter.  Twitter? 
[01:12:30]  What is that, a bird?  See, he can do all these wacky things.  The guy doesn't understand what he's saying.  He's taking notes in there.  Oh, yeah.  Iraq's writing like a maniac.  Is that what's going to happen, Iraq?  Oh, not at all.  Is he going to have some awkward moments like that  where he mentions something about the future?  Yeah.  It's mainly a drama,  but he said there are a lot of comedic elements.  I would hope so.  Did he say, like, download?  They don't know what that is.  And then he goes,  Oh, I'm a nerd.  I forgot where I am.  Ah.  What made you decide the late 40s?  Just the time I picked. 
[01:13:00]  Iraq, also.  Does he jump through time?  Or does he in the 40s?  And now he's got to live his whole life.  He's got to live his whole life.  Holy shit.  So he's got to go back to...  It's a long movie.  He's going to go back to where he was.  You're not doing it day by day.  90 minutes.  It's under 90 minutes.  Under 90 minutes.  Definitely.  From the 40s until 2015.  Can I ask a question, though?  You haven't written it yet.  How do you know it's under 90 minutes?  Don't you have to, like, write it and then...  Eric has broad strokes.  Because you can't sell a long...  Movie?  A fucking movie. 
[01:13:30]  Just ask Tarantino.  It's impossible.  Yeah, but he already...  Just look at those Lord of the Rings flops.  There's a movie.  JFK sucked.  Again, established.  90 minutes is like old Godzilla movies on Channel 5.  Fucking every movie is at least two hours now.  It's my favorite Patrice joke ever when he did Godzilla.  He used to do Godzilla.  What if this movie...  Seriously, we're about to kill...  And in two, three years, it's a fucking mega hit. 
[01:14:00]  B-Rock's accepting the Oscar up there.  And we're all like, what the fuck happened?  Did you see Norton jump off the top of the theater with the noose around his neck?  I'll be a part of the movie.  You'll be in the film.  Are you going to be in it?  In the 40s part.  Best supporting actor.  Oh, Jimmy does have a part.  Jim Norton.  What's my name in the movie?  I haven't given a name, but I have sort of the look and the way you're like.  Can I just say something, though?  You should have names.  You should have, like, the name of the guy.  I should have a script, too, and I don't have that yet.  No, I'm just trying to give you...  I'm not trying to hurt you. 
[01:14:30]  I'm trying to help you.  Oh, gee, Bob, don't give the guy such a hard time.  I'm going to get in character now.  Yeah, that is good.  I can do it.  So he lives his life from...  Don't give me any guff.  You've got a lot of moxie.  Hey, quiet, you mug.  He lives his life from the 40s in real time after that.  There's no more time travel.  Not in real time.  No, but I'm saying there's no more time travel.  That's right.  Let's fatty hot buckle talk.  There's no more time travel, but the movie does jump to different parts in his life as  he's living through that time.  So if we could go from the 40s and then see what he's doing in the 60s... 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Well, the 50s is an hour.  Does he go to Woodstock?  Oh, man.  Does he go to Woodstock?  That would be cool.  Groovy, man.  Do you know how difficult it is to write that type of...  A period piece.  To write that shit.  To go back, write a period piece, but then to jump ahead and back.  Oh, my God.  Do you know how...  He's setting himself up for the most difficult writing task of all.  How about you do something like fucking Clerks first?  Why don't you do that?  You're not jumping back, though.  Once you go back in time, it just goes forward.  Yeah, but no, he goes forward.  Yeah, but you said you go back and forth. 
[01:15:30]  This is a naked epic.  The very beginning of the movie is current time.  Right?  But it jumps right back to that time period.  When he goes through the sliders.  And he's got to live his life.  It's not a slider.  I hope somebody right now is on Netflix finding this exact movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Does he go through the Stargate?  No.  It's not a Stargate?  No.  Now, are there references to the civil rights struggle in the 1950s?  What do you mean, no?  He's living through the 50s.  There's nothing about the civil rights.  No.  Let me ask you a question. 
[01:16:00]  Let me ask you a question.  He's only got like 10 minutes.  Is he down in Atlantic City, and does he come across like a machine, a fortune-telling machine,  and then something happens?  Oh, no.  Does he get younger now?  Yeah.  I wish I was in the late 40s.  When you're casting, do you want Robert Loja?  Quickly.  He's down knots.  I wish I was.  I wish I was a fish.  so in the 50s  is he like  and then he like says something about  like the internet and they're like  internet what do you fish with that 
[01:16:30]  oh  something like that  yeah they're all flexing their muscles and moving their fists  back and forth  like bowser of course  I think Eric just wants to make a really cool soundtrack  is that it  so he's just doing all the decades  and then the 60s  and he's just going to think of a movie around that  are there disco scenes  it's the time of the season  and then they'll be like  fucking Vietnam  yeah it's beautiful man 
[01:17:00]  and the guy's like oh my god I got drafted  I'm in the nom  he'll already be 40 in the 60s  so you won't even have that drama  of the nom  what's he doing in the 60s  he's 40 years old  he's like wait till you guys see  what happens to Richard fucking Nixon  you guys are going to love this  I'm not going to say it  because I don't want to really alter history  but just pay attention to this  Watergate Hotel  enough said  enough said  and then he goes back to the 50s  wasn't Woodstock in 1969 
[01:17:30]  yeah  so Anthony  so he's going to be like  in his late 40s  to go to Woodstock  so in the movie  he's going to be really smart  when he goes back  oh yeah he's going to know everything  from 2013  and then he goes back  and apparently does nothing with it  because E-Roc has him doing nothing  no I'm just not telling you  why are you not telling us  because it's not done  why am I going to give you all the details  when it's not done  I'll bet you the guy does something  really inane  like he invents gravy boats  just some worthless job  gravy boats  E-Roc 
[01:18:00]  you could kind of communicate  what you're thinking  no I can't  no  which one thing he does  because one  it's publicly being said  it's not taking care of  I wouldn't sweat it  let's just get a hold of ourselves here  and give us a couple of nuggets  who's going to steal the idea  to animate a radio show  yeah let's talk about that  that's true  are you saying Ricky Gervais  is going to steal your fucking idea  I'm saying a lot of people have  oh it's wonderful  he goes back to the 40s  he goes back to the 40s  and then he comes back  and he's in the 60s 
[01:18:30]  and he invents all kinds of stuff  Eric is pitching like  Benjamin Button  it's not like  this is an original idea  exactly  time travel has been dealt with  in movies  exactly  contrary to popular belief  hey hey  fucking  shit  garbage  shit  E-Roc  take your damn hands off her  does that happen in the movie  do you punch Biff  yeah  that's all I'm thinking about  yeah  oh yeah  Eric is actually just pitching  Forrest Gump  except the beginning  is slightly different  Forrest Plump 
[01:19:00]  you made that joke yesterday  no I said Forrest  Gut  Forrest Gut  and then right after I said it  and I was walking into my house  after I hung up the phone  I'm like shit  I should have said  Forrest Plump  Plump's a better word  yes  sounds more like gum  but it is  just instead of sitting  at a bus stop  he falls through a slider's  time portal  and then he has to  start his life  that's true  maybe there's a  there's a telephone booth  that he gets into  something like that  he gets stuck in  oh they call it 
[01:19:30]  the curious case  of Benjamin and Jerry's  no  it's  the curious case  of popped buttons  does he go through  historical things  like are there things  that really happen  that we live through  anything  you're not coming  yeah  oh he does  not the big historical things  no  like little ones  yeah little things  yeah  like like fucking 
[01:20:00]  like Mrs. Johnson's  fucking flat tire  he fixes it  something like that  instead of like  stopping the Korean War  anything  Zach  instead of warning JFK  yeah  just anything really stupid  what about that  does he  does he get to warn  anybody of any  impending doom  no  like  well I know what he does  he does little things  like he changes  somebody's tire  but what he doesn't  realize is  changing that tire  is the butterfly effect  that sets off  and the Korean War  butterfly effect  yeah but what 
[01:20:30]  you should call it  butterfly effect  that's right  how about where  Butterball Gush  peanut butter  and fly  Anthony he's gonna  he's gonna actually  he's gonna save  President Kennedy  yeah  on the way up  to the book  whatever  the book fucking  depository  depository  book suppository  depository  million  maybe  he actually  sees a new  vending machine  as he's putting  his snickers  down his throat  oh jeez  what he'll do  is he'll save  Kennedy  yeah  not knowing  that Kennedy  starts a nuclear 
[01:21:00]  war  1967  oh and then you  get back to  fucking 2013  and it's like  fucking like  the Terminator  did I get it  right Eric  is it little  things that  lead to big  things that  he doesn't  realize  are you calling it  the butterfly effect  are you is it  the butterfly effect  do you have to  stop Cyberdyne  is it sliders  do you have to  stop  no  you don't go  back and stop  Cyberdyne  what's the name  of my character  I said I don't  have a name  for your character  what's the name  of your character  I don't have  I don't have 
[01:21:30]  the name yet  what actors  have been cast  as possible  I haven't cast  the whole thing  I wrote some  things with certain  people  that's what I'm  asking you  in the Terminator  the Terminator  Jesus  I've been on  the other end  of this one  yesterday  so who besides  Jim has been  cast in the film  yeah  who do you see  as the lead  first of all  who do you see  as the lead  I don't know  we all know  who the lead is  now when you  think about a movie 
[01:22:00]  and writing movie  the first thing  you kind of  goes through your  head is a  celebrity that you  would want playing  the different parts  you had to have  an idea  right now  you have the idea  of your lead  character  who does he  look like  who does he  like  what celebrity  is it a Brad  Pitt  or is it a  fucking  like an Owen  Wilson  the guinea  with the big  nose  oh  what  he was good  at the piano  he was in  King Kong  pianist  he was in  King Kong  yeah that guy  and he's in  that fucking  Adrian Brody 
[01:22:30]  Adrian Brody  fucking dick nose  whatever  is it Adrian Brody  is it fucking  is it fucking  John McClane  Hulk Hogan  is it  running out of  buildings  exploding  yeah  maybe it's  is it Dwayne  Johnson  oh  I would see  that  I'd see  that  fucking  The Rock  is it Undertaker  he's too old  though  he's 18  we need like  a young  fucking guy  from Twilight  The Rock could  still be one of  the guys from  you know  back in the time 
[01:23:00]  well true  he could be  the older  guy  he gets  old  you gotta  cast this  the lead  has to be  cast multiple  times  because he  gets older  dude  how many  fucking  ah  he didn't  think of that  but from  18  to like  70  right  like Benjamin  Button  oh man  is it just  gonna be like  bad makeup  you are really  fucking  when they  take a 20 year old  guy  they just take  crusty paint  yeah  they put crusty  paint on his neck  by the way  the answer to  is it gonna be  really bad makeup 
[01:23:30]  is he will have  no choice  now he's doing  the makeup too  yeah  oh this is an  independent film  yeah  oh  is this low budget  he's looking for  backing from  major studios  right  he needs a director  looking to sell it  what  oh  oh you don't  even care about it  you just wanna sell it  make the money  he's just gonna sell it  yes  so  I don't get like  well who's been cast  what actors have  I haven't cast anybody  you just said  Jim Norton has a role  who else does  there was a character  that Jim came to mind  and that's  and I developed  something around Jim 
[01:24:00]  who else do you have  characters in mind for  just Jim  I have other characters  written  not full detail  but just little  descriptions on  certain people  but I haven't picked  is Jim the guy  that when they do  the time travel  it doesn't work right  and he comes out  half done  half done  me  oh shit  you're out coming  that's you  shut up Chip  it's just a little  it's a little 
[01:24:30]  bobo-ish  to like be writing  a movie  and to have only  so far cast people  I know  who are on the show  right  somebody inspires  no one else  was cast  is Opie the lead  nobody else  was cast  Opie is the lead  he is  that's obvious  Opie and Hulk  the Hulk  he wants to just  fucking one day  drop the script  in front of Opie  and say I got  something for you  and Opie will  finally look at him  like an equal  I have you in mind  Opie will be like  I read your script  I think you can play  a variety of ages  Opie spills his  Cheerios and  blueberries on it  get this out of my way 
[01:25:00]  so alright  the guy's 18  he goes back in time  he starts affecting  history in some way  or another  he goes to the  sliders portal  what's the hook  there's no sliders portal  what's the hook  you're gonna have to  follow this guy  from the 40's  up to modern times  what is happening  during that  what's the hook  not the one you  cut your mouth on  I'm sorry  Jesus Christ  let's erase that part  what happens  what goes on  through  that's a lot of years 
[01:25:30]  I know you don't  want to give it away  but I'm sure  it's a lot of years  give us something  because you have a  70 year span  with a 19 year old  actor  Jesus  I mean  I don't want to  give anything away  oh my god  there's gotta be  something that  happens through  history  one thing  Iraq  don't worry  no one's gonna  steal it  yeah  this is back  to the future  and fucking  Terminator  and every other  god damn time  travel movie  if the only time  travel thing  happens in the  very beginning  what is that  hook that keeps 
[01:26:00]  everybody  right  is there  yeah  something's  gonna happen  that this guy  has to stop  maybe there's  another  maybe he runs  into another  sliders portal  and he realizes  you know what  I'm gonna stay  ladies and gentlemen  if you look out  the windows  you'll see  the 1935  World's Fair  does that happen  is it a plane  because that's  35  35 sorry  no something's  gonna happen  in present time  yeah  and  maybe it's 
[01:26:30]  an iPhone app  the boy goes  back  yeah  and it has  to stop  what's gonna  happen  in the present  time  just to  like I'll bet  it's something  really topical  like nuclear  weapons are  flying  hopefully  that's his  movie being  written  he has to go  back in time  to break  Eric's fucking  hands  I love that  you were just  talking about  how people get  shit on with  their dreams  and you just  step right up  and rip your  pants down  take a big dump  this is what I  know about this  show  it's coming  yeah  that's all  that's true  look I'm getting  some in right  now  I hear you 
[01:27:00]  and the  fucking  the fat jokes  are coming  not today  little cabs  coming in  that fucking  midget  there is no  action  there are no  action  no action  sequences  right  it's not an  action movie  not at all  there's no  action  drama with a  bit of comedic  element  you're coming  out of the  gate with a  drama  and some  romance  and a  sliders  portal  hey doll  does your  romantic interest  give you the  clap in 1950  I'm gonna be  writing this  because she's  got a bad  rep  this really  needs a  sliders  portal  yeah  that's the way 
[01:27:30]  it should go  give us some  tell us one  come on  Iraq  we're fucking  clamoring here  like if you  pitch this  yeah  you're gonna have  to tell them  something  yeah  I'd pitch it  once it was  done  I'm not  pitching it  in the beginning  what hooks  the 70 years  are you fighting  vampires  are the vampires  in it  werewolves  no sci-fi  none of that  but that's not  sci-fi  vampires  is it like  last action  hero where  some characters  come to the  movie screen  is that it  no  can you fly  no  you know  superhero  so what is it 
[01:28:00]  that keeps  everybody hooked  for those 70  years  yeah  what he  just locked  the theater  doors  what he does  throughout that  period and  coming to a  realization when  he makes it  back to the  time when he  knew he went  back to begin  with  he doesn't have  he doesn't get to  meet himself  does he  terrible  are you gonna  give fred savage  this treatment  is he the  old man that  the kid was  talking to in  the beginning  gotta give him 
[01:28:30]  my treatment  no no no  or like the  old man gave  him some advice  and then he  realizes  it was him  do you give  do you give a  sports almanac to  yourself  when you get  did you go back  in time and  become a not  shitty radio  guy  so come on  give us  something  what's the  hook  tell us  something  does he  meet himself  as an old  guy meeting  himself as a  young 18 year  old guy  he doesn't  meet himself  but he 
[01:29:00]  finds out what  happens to  himself  the 18 year  old finds out  what happens  to himself  the old man  finds out what  happens after  everything he  did  what old man  oh so he  goes back  he does some  shit and then  he sees like  what happened to  his 18 year old  self because of  what he did  he doubles  himself so his  18 year old  self still lives  in 2013  while another  he lives in  two places at  once  if you see  each other  it can make  a paradox  that can destroy  the universe  that don't make 
[01:29:30]  no sense  oh jesus  once he goes  into the  sliders portal  he doesn't  exist in 2013  anymore  yeah it's  fucking sliders  cocksucker  oh damn  piece of garbage  chip  let him be  creative  chip doesn't  know what  sliders is  yeah i do  what is it  fucking i don't  know  sliders  it's about  tiny hamburgers  that's what  yeah of course  that was his  motivation from  the beginning  so okay  so he  fucking  so he 
[01:30:00]  okay i see  what happened  now is he  purposefully  trying to  change things  to change  to change his  own life  through history  or he  just so  happens  to be  skipping  through life  throughout  these years  and then  goes oh my  god i didn't  realize what i  did affected  me  coming  it could  give us a scene  doesn't have to  be the climax  a scene  how does  everybody  what do all 
[01:30:30]  his friends  think when  he disappears  when he's 19  years old in  2013 and then  he just disappears  for the next  70 years  well he doesn't  disappear  well he goes  back in time  but he's at  2013 let's say  and then he goes  back in time  he doesn't  disappear  because he's  but the young  him is back  in the 1940s  so how can  the young  him also be  because it's not  part of the  story  because it  hasn't been  2013 yet  stupid  but he doesn't  exist anymore  yeah but it  doesn't matter  because that  hasn't happened  yet  but he went  back  but to the 
[01:31:00]  other people  who are living  it does  so all of a  sudden he just  he's still there  he meets his  mom and  falls in love  with her  and has  sex and  makes him  he's his  own dad  he invents  the shaved  pussy  back in the  40s  oh man  actually the  shaved pussy  this is pretty  I like this  the shaved pussy  was invented  way before that  yeah they did  the whores  back in the  old west  they did not  they did  they thought  that prevented  disease 
[01:31:30]  that's why  they used  to make  them wear  the little  what are they  called  the jigs  for the  pussies  what are they  called  pussy wigs  merkins  and that's  where they  were made  out of beaver  pelt  and that's  where the  beaver came  from  stop it  swear to god  you are so  full of shit  I swear to  fuck  how can I  make that  up out of  the fucking  blue  and they  connected  with the  beaver  part  so they  didn't get  crabs  or lichen  they used to  shave  you knew  a woman  was a 
[01:32:00]  prostitute  if she  had to  shave  pussy  because the  crabs  and all  that  stuff  they thought  I don't  think  you did  it would  have been  to shave  your pussy  back then  with what a  straight razor  and that  thing where  you take  the shaving  cream  and go  and mix  it up  the brush  one wrong  move and  you got  two slugs  on the  floor  you got  a Clint Eastwood  asking you  questions  which way 
[01:32:30]  did he go  he slices  your pussy  a little  is that  so  alright  Iraq  I'm using  that  give us  yeah he's  using that  for his  treatment  he can't  Iraq  you gotta  give us  one thing  that happens  through history  with this  main character  that sort  of has  an impact  on his  future self  does he get  angry and  just run  for years  and grow  a beard  that can  happen  it's a good  one  chop that  in  shrimp  fisherman  shrimp  what happens  one thing

[01:42:30]  are funny  motherfuckers  with their phone  you rock  that's great  it sounds like a hit  to me  is Bo Derek in it  no  did she have her  leg bitten off  Jesus  what a funny reference  oh shit  are you in it  cigars and scotch 
[01:43:00]  is asking  is it eternal sunshine  of the spotless plate  that's a good one  that's a good one  here they come  here they come  here they come  is it a clockwork ham  and here they come  you rock  any scenes in the mall  does he go to the mall  no  there was no malls  back then  maybe he invents the mall  he goes to the 40s  50s 60s 70s  80s 90s  2000  in 2010  the mall's in the 70s  he's in the fucking 
[01:43:30]  he's in the radio station  a lot  no  no  that's a good thing  in one particular time  he just fucks something up  and changes the future  you're in the movie once  he probably hands somebody  he probably hands somebody  he probably has a job  at the radio  and he plays something  he shouldn't play  why don't you play this  yeah  oh no what's he doing  I'm pulling my hair out  in the other room  oh boy  nerds  nerds  who is this mystery fat kid  well  he is overweight  the character  a little 
[01:44:00]  a little chubby  can I play him  the misadventures  of the mysterious fat kid  oh shit  who gets stuck  in a sliders portal  oh  need to kick him through  uh  alright  is it  uh  lord of the onion rings  how about the blobbit  did you say the blobbit  I'm so glad  I'm so close to this  but I'm so far away  I'm sorry Eric 
[01:44:30]  but  that was hilarious  ah  this is  the lord of the onion rings  come on man  you gotta give us more  we're fucking  we're digging this  you got yourself  a good movie  sounds awesome  that sounds awesome  I love time travel movies  by the way  I just saw Looper  a couple of  about last week  and it was very cool  I'm worried that there's not  enough time travel  it seems like it happens  once in the beginning  and then that's it  he just loses his life  Looper  no  oh this guy  I like that too  I like that  that he has to go back once 
[01:45:00]  and then he has to get back  to where he was  but in real time  but we don't have to sit around  back to the future  I'm setting you back  sit here for 70 years  yeah yeah  that sounds a little dull  we have one more word  in the title  yeah  come on  Iraq  two words out of six  is not that much  one word  is wrestling in the title  McMahon  no  Iraq  incompetent  titties  burden 
[01:45:30]  elephant  lesbos  distracted  fan fiction  is Lego in the title  is it a series  like Harry Pot Roast  did you use the word  coke or float  no  yeah  what state does it  take place in  like what state  New York City  oh does he ever  New York City and LA  he has never traveled  like south  or like  like to Florida  or anything like that 
[01:46:00]  what does he take  the Pan Am Clipper over  yeah  does he fly over  to just meet with  the big movie producer  real quick  yeah  is he a filmmaker  in the film  is it self reflexive  are there any historical  events that happen  that he causes  yes  not that he interacts  good question Bob  he caused a historical event  does he cause historical events  that really did  does he bump  does he bump into the  world trade centers  do these events  actually  are they events that  actually happen in real life 
[01:46:30]  or does he cause  new historical events  um  good question  new  there's  there's one or two  new things that happen  Iraq  hold on  yeah  does he fucking  tell  uh  the people at the airport  in Boston  that there's terrorists  no  getting on a  why  no  cause he doesn't  interfere with shit  that are  why  why the fuck  wouldn't he stop 9-11  why wouldn't he stop 9-11  cause he doesn't care  what  an asshole's tale  of time travel  he's a rogue  time traveler 
[01:47:00]  Iraq  why doesn't he care  it was 9-11  everybody cares about 9-11  except assholes  your movie's unpatriotic  you hate America  and the soldiers  you're telling me  this guy didn't call him  freedom fries  for a little while  no  what a dick  Iraq  why wouldn't you  fucking  why wouldn't he stop 9-11  stop 9-11  it would be easy  he could be a hero  hero  he could be a hero  he's not  is he an anti-hero  Iraq  wouldn't people wonder  why he didn't stop 9-11 
[01:47:30]  it might  you could  I guess view him  sort of as  of an anti-hero  cause it's all about himself  I would view him  as a villain  he's selfish  knowing what he knows  he's not there to help  other people  why  cause he only wants  to help himself  why  have a hateable  lead character  who didn't stop 9-11  he didn't stop 9-11  that doesn't make sense  you gotta have  so you have to have  a likable guy  why am I gonna watch  the movie  a 90 minute movie  you'll like him  but for the wrong reasons  does he love to hate him  does he call NASA 
[01:48:00]  and tell him there's  gonna be a problem  with Apollo 13  nope  what a dick  what an asshole  this guy is  what a fuck  what does he do  he just rules the world  do people know  that he's from the future  no  oh so nobody's like  why wouldn't you tell us  about 9-11  dick  that doesn't happen  does he stop Columbine  nope  does he stop Francis Ford  Kubler from putting his daughter  in fucking Godfather 3  does he stop Newtown  does he stop Newtown  come on  he doesn't stop Newtown 
[01:48:30]  does he stop new kids  in the block  oh  they wouldn't have banned  guns for Anthony  if he had stopped Newtown  what a prick this character is  write your own movie  I like it  yeah you're a real pud  what an asshole  I say we all write a movie  against this movie  is it called  The Asshole Through Time  that's a good title  it should be  what a dickhead  this guy is  yeah  does he fucking  he doesn't save anybody  well I bet he kills people  like Jack LaLanne  and all those other  troublemakers  does he  does he kill anyone  Jack LaLanne  that's horrible 
[01:49:00]  does he kill anyone  does he kill anyone  comment DRock  I didn't write anything down  about killing anybody  does he interact with Malcolm X  no  does he fucking  keep Martin Luther King  from being killed  nope  he doesn't change  Robert Kennedy  certain things in history  no  no  does he stop plane crashes  nope  tell people there's problems  he doesn't help humanity  why  can you imagine going back in time  it really is autobiographical  does he stop a couple 
[01:49:30]  from going in a church  oh yeah  that would be good  please  help us out  he stops a tape  from being delivered at BAB  oh  that's terrible  can you imagine  going back in time  and having that little impact  and literally everything  just happened  the way you read about it  like  I can imagine  being in time now  and having little impact  really  you have the option  if you go back in time  one thing he does  one thing  you don't find that interesting  that he knows  certain things would happen 
[01:50:00]  and he just watches it happen  doesn't do anything about it  no  it's sociopathic  that's dull  the only way that's interesting  I've already seen that  do you show him crying on a rock  as the buildings go down  yeah  huh  do you show him crying on a rock  watching the buildings go down  no  he doesn't care  so he doesn't even give a shit  I know what it's about  it's about a guy  who goes back  and doesn't change anything  because he knows  he's ineffective  in life  it's about a guy  accepting his own  mediocrity 
[01:50:30]  and his own  but wouldn't something  over the course of 70 years  make him realize  wait a minute  I could actually do something  it's very autobiographical  it's about a man  accepting his mediocrity  and doing nothing  to change anything around him  but as he's getting older  he doesn't change  he doesn't have a different thought  when he's fucking 50  than he did when he's 18  and decide  maybe I'll start helping people  nope  this is starting to sound terrible  yeah  awful  he just basically  it's a time travel  he needs a slider porter  a time traveling 
[01:51:00]  gelatinous mass  yeah  what the fuck  Iraq  what a one dimensional character  no  he doesn't change at all  during the course of the film  he changes  but not  to help anybody  stock an apple  in the end  in the end  does he get better  um  yeah  does he get on a shortwave radio  and talk to his son  how could anybody  how could anybody  like him in the end  in the end  you're supposed to like him  yeah what does he do  but you still know  that he didn't stop  9-11  or Newtown  or Columbine  he's a fucking asshole 
[01:51:30]  he's a dickhead  no  no sequel  if he falls in a sliders portal  at the end there is  so think about it right now  yeah  whoa  does it  not  and he goes like this  as he's falling  not again  what  and then  and then power of love  kicks in  right  everybody walks out  does it  woo  yeah  roll credits  written  by  E-Rock  Eric  E-Rock  Nagle  are the words  sex or bagel  in the title  no 
[01:52:00]  okay  does the E-Rock  video  thing  end the movie  this is the one  like a YouTube video  this is the movie  I want him to remember me for  he probably invents  like Nintendo  and stuff like that  E-Rock forgot to  write 9-11  into the script  but it has  Sega Genesis  it's like  32 bits  that's impossible  does he invent  Sega Genesis  no  Sonic the Hedgehog  no 
[01:52:30]  Tails  ColecoVision  Atari  no  Sonic  Pimble  does he just go back  and play these video games  ToeJam & Earl  does he  does he let  alright  does he hook up  with a girl  at any point  yes  alright  does he tell her  anything about his  time traveling exploits  um  not directly  no  well  as time goes on  she figures out  certain things  oh  how does she figure it out 
[01:53:00]  cause he's doing  like some fucking  I'm not telling you  he goes down on her  and that just wasn't done  back then  what are you doing there  what are you doing there  oh my goodness  that feels good  does she ever get to a point  where she's like  I can't believe  I spent my life  with a person  who didn't stop  9-11 from happening  yeah  when Warren was a king  from being killed  or fucking Kennedy  yeah  he just keeps saying  watch what happens  tomorrow  I bet he just goes  and photographs  all these things  so he has the best  pictures ever  right  like he has a great  new angle  of the fucking  Zapruder film  is he cub reporter 
[01:53:30]  John Lennon gets shot  and his chick  is just like  are you fucking telling me  you could have  stopped that  he's like yeah  but I got him  to sign something first  look at this photo  of him falling down  here's some fake charities  getting things signed for  that's what the movie is  he's just getting  autographs and pictures  how long is he with the girl  she stays with him  through most of the movie  wait wait  so he picks her up  in the late 40s  a little later than that 
[01:54:00]  so she's got like  a poodle skirt  maybe  yeah  where does he meet her  at the hop  when she's 17  and he's 33  yeah  he's at late 50s  into the 60s  so that's the 60s  so in the late 40s  he's 20  he's 19  around there  so he's about 30  he meets her  in his 30s  Sandy  yeah  what happens  they meet  and they fall in love  on a beach  and then he gets in trouble  for jerking off  the masseuse  people want to see 
[01:54:30]  young love  they don't want to see  somebody meet  the woman of their dreams  deep into their 30s  he rock  when fatty met Sally  oh my  and then not  stop 9-11  and then they grow together  Iraq  is any of this  helping you  this is probably helping right  no  no knowing that  the things not to do  and things you have to do  a lot of this  wasn't even planned to do  do you run in  and tell your wife  everything that's happening  as it's happening  and annoy her 
[01:55:00]  while she's watching TV  oh my god  I have an idea  so guess what happens next  hey you better stay away  from downtown today  ah right  downtown  oh yeah  vague idiot  vague idiot  is that the name of it  yeah  the vague idiot  the vague idiot  in a bunch of different times  and his time traveling adventures  yeah  he did  he tried to stop 9-11  but he was too vague  he'd come to the airport  like  something's happening  something's up  that guy looks weird right  are you letting people  on the plane today  yeah  I don't know 
[01:55:30]  hey you watching the news later  yeah  alright  well  you're gonna be  you're gonna be checking people  for  weapons online  yes  atta boy  atta boy  what did you say  atta boy  what the fuck does that mean  exactly  gotta go  gotta go  click  and he hangs up  he goes  he should get it  he should get it  I bet he gets it  what inspired you to make the movie  like what movies  inspired you to start writing 
[01:56:00]  nothing  it's something  an idea I had a long time ago  and I just  finally started writing notes down  where's the 12 Monkeys  12 Chunky Monkeys  I've never seen 12 Monkeys  have you seen the show  Sliders  it's great  fucking Sliders  it just sounds a lot like Sliders  it sounds like every  time travel movie  yeah  that Jerry O'Connell  has been in  Sal what do you think  you liking the  can I tell you something  Sal told me in the phone  screening room 
[01:56:30]  first of all he's been  crying laughing  he's been giddy  he laughed all afternoon  and he told me he was  lying in bed  last night  going to sleep  and he started giggling  to himself about this movie  Sal's overreacting to this  yeah  Sal what do you think  maybe he's  maybe Sal comes from  the future  and he's seen  E-Rock movies  flop  oh shit  or maybe he saw  it was a hit  and wants to undermine  E-Rock's fame and fortune  oh  he's here to destroy  E-Rock the filmmaker  I cannot wait to see this film 
[01:57:00]  oh yeah  oh my god  I'm so excited  good one  what uh  yeah  so I heard you  you were  you were  absolutely giddy yesterday  I was crying  yeah  I was absolutely crying  I think it's just such a huge undertaking  to try to pull this off  wouldn't you  yeah you know  I hate to say this  but Sal's got a point  E-Rock  wouldn't you start  with something a little  uh easier  a little easier to write  start with like a  cast  about all  about dialogue  you know  like something heavy on dialogue  you know what  not that much on acting 
[01:57:30]  no E-Rock  don't write with limitations  these guys are trying to  you're not trying  you're just  all you're doing is writing  everything in your imagination  should be able to spill out  on that paper  that's right  that's what editing's for  yeah  that's not your job  to make this thing  you're writing it  that's true  and if you want to write sliders  into a movie  write sliders into a movie  yeah  I was a little bit behind  but I heard that  the guy doesn't change  anything in history  this is a new detail  he doesn't stop 9-11  he doesn't stop anything  nothing  no Martin Luther King  still dies  9-11 still happens 
[01:58:00]  JFK  because he's the same  selfish guy  at 18  as he is at 70  that's right  so the character  doesn't learn anything  no  no character growth  he's a selfish lump  no advancement  no character advancement  no arc  does he grow Eric  he grows as a person  later  what does he learn  because every character  needs to learn  later  like after 2001  that's where 9-11 happened  he should have been  he's going to be an old man  by 9-11  yeah  it's like 60  yeah 
[01:58:30]  he should have done  his growing by then  oh god  that's the autumn of his life  fucking hate this  he's not telling us  terrible movie  the name of the movie  everything  then don't watch it  I'm a fucking  it's called  I'm a fucking prick  I'm an asshole prick  we're not going to have a choice  not to watch it  yeah  we're going to act it out  on the show  Iraq when  am I in it  will pen hit paper  where's Iraq  Iraq  am I in it  is there any roles  for your friends  like other than Jim  of course there is  Iraq when will pen hit paper  on this

[01:59:30]  but I gotta take a piss  I can't believe  there's six words  in the title  that's the fucking  longest title ever  what the fuck  could it be  one of those long titles  it's just  ugh why  I don't know  I have to pee too  I want to plug something  real quick  oh yes of course  tickets are on sale now  for myself  and Dave Attell  February 22nd  and 23rd  at the MGM Grand  Hollywood Theater  in Vegas  and next Friday  and Saturday  25-26  I'm in San Diego  at the American Comedy Company  and Sunday

[02:02:30]  I don't care  about Easter B  I didn't love that one  I don't like  any of the  Ramones songs  there are a couple though  We're a Happy Family  is the best song  yeah you like that one  it's my favorite  meow  meow  who's coming in  later on  we got  Kevin Hart  is supposed to be here  and  Bernard Hopkins  Bernard Hopkins  who is fighting again  at how old  I think he just turned 48  what's  what's today's date  15th  this might be 
[02:03:00]  Bernard's birthday  why would you do that  as a person  he's trying to fight  yeah at that age  I mean I'm not saying  you know  I'll ask him  fuck he's coming in  but why are you fighting  at that age  you still got it  if you think you can still do it  and then you make that money  how old's the guy  he's fighting  this is  58  oh now it makes sense  this is his 29th  future  oh  it's his 29th  world championship fight  wow  29  fucking championship fights  is he all there  or something  yeah 
[02:03:30]  Hopkins oh yeah  he's there  yes  how do you do that  don't get hit  yeah  yeah  he's had him a bunch of times  he doesn't rope a dope  like Ali did  sitting on them ropes  just letting people punch him  in the fucking head  I saw him in uh  in uh  that's fucking terrible  why did Ali do that  I know  because that was the only way  to get Foreman  to punch himself out  it was brilliant  he punched him in the arms  it was brilliant  he didn't punch him in the head  he punched him in the fucking  it was the arms  well he would do the rope a dope  so he put his hands  against his face  yeah  all shots on the body  all body shots 
[02:04:00]  yeah  all arm shots  he got hit in the head though  he got hit in the gloves  yeah yeah yeah  but your brain is still getting smacked  exactly  whenever I see the guys  put the gloves up to their face  and get hit in the gloves  it's like one of those things  on the office desk  where he goes  tic tic tic tic  you just  it goes right through those gloves  into your face  it's like a croquet fucking thing  he was  letting him punch himself out  and it worked  and he would taunt him  while he was doing it  and it worked  and he fucking ran out of gas  in the eighth round  well why was he driving Jimmy  I don't understand  well he had to go somewhere  and in Kinshasa  things get so crazy 
[02:04:30]  he knew the rain was coming  oh right  now it makes some sense  that it was in Kinshasa  what do I know  the rains  came thank goodness  he had enough gas  to get there  oh my goodness gracious  oh that's kind of cool  okay  I'm amazed that Hopkins  is still 48 fucking years old  and fighting again  who's the heavyweight champion  I don't know  who's any  do you know any champions  I do not know  I really don't  I haven't fought in the months  the day where everyone knew  like when Tyson fought  you knew Tyson was it  you knew the light heavyweight  the middleweight  the heavyweight 
[02:05:00]  you know who the fucking  the champions were  yeah what happened  I don't know man  what happened  why don't we know  the chomp  when  I know the Klitschko  Klitschko is a heavyweight  the Klitschko fucking  Klitschko right here  I'm pointing in my mouth  oh shit  see you get it  Klits  because he's a womanizer  it's amazing  fucking he puts you  like a champ  do you  no you don't  no you don't chip  you don't eat pussy  I bet you're not  very good at that  fuck you  I get it so wet  it's like a fucking  tsunami or something 
[02:05:30]  a tsunami or something  you suck chip  I bet you suck dick  oh man  oh by the way  there's a mob boss  saying he knows  where Jimmy Hoffa is  and the people  actually believe him  but this has been  said many times  but not by someone  they said  this is the most  credible guy  they said  really  but didn't they say  like they chopped him up  and fucking burnt him  and threw him in acid  haven't they said that  in the past  they said he was buried  in a shallow grave  he's an underboss  why  alright look 
[02:06:00]  why would you go through  all the trouble  of kidnapping him  and trying to keep  things undercover  and then bury him  in a shallow grave  they were going to move him  he said  have a wing  Anthony Zarelli  came out  he's 85  he's 85 years old  he was the mob underboss  I think his father  started the Chicago mob  he said  they buried him  in a shallow grave  they were going to  move him  to a hunting lodge  in northern Michigan  oh that's nice  but he was in jail  at the time  it happened  so they left him 
[02:06:30]  where he was  is he going to  tell people  where it is  I think so  and they say  he might be  the most credible  person to come forward  so far  he's having some  issues with the mob  there  I guess  they're all annoyed  with him  really  yeah whatever it is  the respect  yeah  but now he's just  pissed off  wow  so what does that mean  is there any  any place where he is  he knows  they can find  some DNA  do that DNA thing  hopefully yeah  I doubt it 
[02:07:00]  remember when they said  he was buried  at a giant stadium  yeah  when they built it  they fucking put him  in some concrete  yeah  something like that  he was what  he was the head  of the teamsters  yeah  like not local  or the entire teamsters  I think the entire  fucking nationwide  teamsters  he was like a powerful dude  and then  I guess he fucked up  and what  what did he do wrong  well back then  there was probably  a bunch of shit  dealing with organized crime  you think he knew  mafia people  oh boy  what  the teamsters  back in those days 
[02:07:30]  yeah absolutely  I actually don't know  I know that  I watched that  Nicholson movie  but I guess I didn't  watch it closely enough  with Danny DeVito  and he was Hoffa  was DeVito in there  DeVito was in there  yeah  oh shit  see it was a while ago  and I don't remember  DeVito's so small  he is a tiny little guy  if I watch a movie  that he's in  and I  something  makes me realize  how small he is  like  something in the background  or a little kid  walks by  he's the same height  same height  I'd ruin the fucking movie  for me  yeah  you think  Iraq will cast him  in his own movie 
[02:08:00]  DeVito would be good  for one of the parts  I'm sure  maybe somebody  that dies in the  World Trade Center  because he didn't  fucking warn anybody  exactly  what a dumbass character  oh he's an asshole  that annoys the piss  out of me  that he won't  fucking  his character  it just stinks  let's go tickle him  and it's a one character movie  like he doesn't have  he has like the girlfriend  but  everyone else is just  this peripheral Jimmy  at the radio station  you're following the guy  for 70 years  70 fucking years  who won't stop 9-11  you don't like him  with no interaction  with people  great 
[02:08:30]  and it's just because  he doesn't want to  make a phone call  like he's not going to  benefit from 9-11  I'm fixated  I don't know what  annoys me more  the fucking  new gun legislation  in New York  or Iraq's fucking movie  exactly  pissing me off  at least I'm not asking  you to finance it  that's true  well not yet anyway  he will  I'm sure once  Opie turns you down  yeah  even though he has  a part in the movie  oh is Opie in the movie  of course he is  no he doesn't  shut up he does  he's one of the  radio guys  if you want him  to finance the movie  you're going to have  to probably put him in  I'm going to have  to write all of you  in if I want financing  for the movie  yeah  I'll give you $20 
[02:09:00]  right now  put me in  how much  what's the budget for  what do you think  what do you think  the budget is  I have no idea  I wouldn't know  how to figure that out  really  well you've seen movies  before right  yeah but they're  always overinflated  what are you eating  you didn't eat enough  oh shit  wipe your face  Bobby  wipe your face  listen you little  midget  just sit down  it's the complete  opposite  look at you  you're big  and Jim won't  stop losing weight  speaking of Danny  DeVito

[02:10:30]  what do you need  oh shit  that is good  what do you need  if you don't get  your little baby finger  out of my face  I'm going to fight it off  that is good  he needs  he needs a little bit of money  maybe a part of a movie  bobby's a very good actor  that's nice  oh Kevin's peeling off hundreds  oh yeah  Keith does that on Saturday  after he's done hosting  that's for bobby  right there  oh man  that'll buy a stroller  fucking bobby  I'm taking it  you don't buy a stroller  you're going to take it bobby  that's because I love you  a stroller man  come on  nobody knows what that was  all I did was hair stuff bobby  that was for me and you and Jim 
[02:11:00]  well I was going to do more  for you and bobby  Jim didn't get his taste  Jim is still on air  so I don't know  if anything's wrong with Jim yet  I don't know  I'm going to go to AIDS  with that fucking money  what's up man  what's going on  we've just been hanging  bullshitting  just hanging  how was the garden  Chris Rock  I think tweeted  or texted  or put it on Facebook  it was one of the best comedy shows  he ever saw  holy shit  let me tell you what's crazy about Chris  Chris bought tickets  he didn't even call me for tickets 
[02:11:30]  he just showed up  and came  which was amazing  I think that's bigger than  that's bigger than someone  saying they're coming  and supporting you  the fact that Chris Rock  came  bought tickets  and then showed them  after  well if someone could peel off  hundreds better than you  it's Chris Rock  first of all  let me tell you  the biggest shock  to my ego  so in LA  a friend of mine  is having a birthday party  at a comedy club  I was having Chris Spencer  been out in LA  for a long time  everybody always comes 
[02:12:00]  to his birthday  all the comedians  come out  and say hey  and go on stage  so literally  I think I'm going last  I show up late  yo  Kevin Hart's coming  oh my god  Kevin Hart's on stage  I come on stage  happy birthday Chris  I do a little set  and he was like  how do you follow  Kevin Hart  oh my god  Chris Rock  ladies and gentlemen  oh shit  Chris just comes up  after me  and I just  oh damn  it doesn't matter  he just came up  after me  it doesn't matter  well or not  he didn't go on stage  to talk about anything  did they all say 
[02:12:30]  you don't belong there  because Kevin was just here  or were they happy to see him  no they went  they went crazy  I think they immediately  forgot that I was even  on stage  oh shit  immediately  but that's the power  of Chris Rock  that's why he's amazing  this car  I'm in an airport  at like 6 in the morning  I'm exhausted  I just did 7 shows  at an improv  he comes walking through  like it's fucking  4 in the afternoon  Versace matching everything  right  with an entourage  and a hot chick  and he walks  he looks at me  I'm tired 
[02:13:00]  I got like a  like a fucking  honey bun in one hand  a coffee  and he walks  in front of everybody  he goes  what the fuck  happened to you man  oh shit  then he goes  he goes yo man  you need  you need me to get you  through security  oh shit  I got a lady  that just walks me through  did you wait in line  did you do that  oh my  cause I don't wait in line  but if you need me  I was so  the last person  in the world  and I just kicked  his fucking stupid  you didn't need that  no  no  he had no energy 
[02:13:30]  to do anything else  the only thing  he extended  was his foot  that's the only thing  that moved  was the bottom half  of his foot  that's it  he gets the lady  who walks you through  he doesn't  right  he doesn't go  through security  that's what happens  Bobby  there's a fat lady  in a red vest  that's fucking great  man  this is the love of life  that I'm mad  yeah they're called  the greeters  right  they walk you through  they just walk you through  I don't like to  wow that is nice  you can get that too  Bobby  you just gotta pay for it  yeah that's all Bobby  you just gotta pay for it  what  can you do money  you just pay for it 
[02:14:00]  I fucking hate you  I really do  holy shit  he just  he really  he really does  know how to rub it in  he's the best  that is good  how much is a greeter  how much is it  to get a greeter  I don't look at bills  I can't tell you guys  I don't even know  holy shit  who knows  whatever right  they're nice people  they're great  that's it  they're great people  when did you reach the point  where you didn't even have to look at bills anymore  or fucking like 
[02:14:30]  you just knew it was gonna get paid  you're asking me  no matter what you bought  you knew it wasn't gonna interfere  with your fucking living  well here's the thing  if you as a human  say you're at the point  where you don't look at bills  it means you're dumb  because it means everybody's robbing you  well that's probably true  sure  so I always look at bills  that's just me joking  you don't have to worry about them  oh yeah  worry about them is different  no you know  I'm okay financially  but you know  in the back of my mind  I can always go back  to what it was  and these guys definitely know  what it used to be  yeah  were you like broke  oh it was beyond that 
[02:15:00]  it was a level  it was broke  and there was a level  underneath broke  I remember your car  you just had a shit car  no no no  that's what I said  they know  like they know  where it was  so my appreciation  for where I am right now  is at a different level  oh shit  you know  the reason why I can act like this  with them  is because you can only be like this  with people that know you  yeah well you'd be a complete asshole  if you just walked up to strangers  and he knows we won't cry  until he leaves  it's literally like  you can be the guy 
[02:15:30]  that you always wanted to be  and act like  with your friends  that really know you  you can be obnoxious  you can be a joke  yeah of course  fuck you  but it's good  because it's with your friends  that really know you  but you know  for me  it's a certain level  of appreciation  and humbleness  that comes  with getting to what you got  that makes you go  okay breathe deep  this is crazy  this is amazing  relish in it  but at the same time  stay focused  you don't want it to stop  so that's constantly going  right here  yeah that's  that's really the fucking 
[02:16:00]  the niche of the whole thing  is like  oh fuck  now I gotta sustain this shit  because the fear  of going back  to picking up  fucking half oatmeal cookies  under the locker  on the floor  of the school  and eating it  he did that  there was an oatmeal cookie  on the ground  I was hungry  under the locker  in school  and he ate it  oh I ate that fucking cookie  the fear of taking  verbal abuse  from two guys  who you know  don't look better than you  oh shit  that's the worst thing ever  that's the nightmare  for you 
[02:16:30]  that's the nightmare  the fear of sitting  hey Kevin what happened  yeah just the fear  of look at you  look at you  the fear is to walk  back into the cellar  broke and Keith  not even bad  we knew you'd be back  stupid  yeah  are you careful  with like  I'm sure you are  but you're business  managers and stuff  like I don't let anybody  even on my financial level  I don't let anybody  have power of attorney  I give everybody  power of attorney  and I just sit there  because it's so convenient  they would never steal  no one would ever steal 
[02:17:00]  from me  I'm too nice  no  I went to that road  I had business managers  before  I've been broke  after having money  before  oh man  you went through  you went through  a well off  and then a broke  yes  that's the best lesson  to learn  it's the best lesson ever  fuck that  it's only the best lesson  once you get  fucking money again  once you get money again  I was gonna say  it's the best lesson  but here's the thing  they never stole from me  nobody ever stole from me  my business managers  never stole from me  it was people working for me  that just did their jobs  in other words  they paid bills 
[02:17:30]  paid taxes  but nobody explained to me  how money worked  how taxes worked  and at the young age  of 25, 26  you know  you get these checks  and you're thinking  they're yours  and this is your money  oh yeah  they didn't take anything out  10% to the agent  10% to the manager  30% to the government  they didn't tell me anything  it was just  okay  time to pay this  and wipe  and you're like  hammer time  what do you mean  I got 300 dollars left  I just had  so that was a lesson I learned  I got audited once  it's terrible  oh yeah  it's the most disgusting thing ever 
[02:18:00]  yeah  I almost jumped out  a fucking window  why did they  audited you Bobby  what were they  they didn't have anything  they ordered  they ordered  it's fucking easy for me  why would they get it  I don't know what that is  what were you doing  that's the one sheet  that you fill out  when you're gonna get  a fucking $100 refund  Bobby will you  get the fucking food  off your face  please  Jesus Christ  Bobby just  will you just  not be big  for two seconds  damn  I told him and Keith  when I first moved back 
[02:18:30]  different LA  that I got a joint bank account  with my chick  they smashed me  I was so mad  I remember that  I was so mad  and they ripped them all up  in the car  and threw me out  in Jersey City  and well they should  get out of the car  it was the most in love thing  I've ever seen in my life  what  we both got the same bank account  yeah  she sees what I see  what do you mean  let me tell you a little something  about a joint fucking bank account  when you get a  when she gets a divorce lawyer  and then you go to the bank  to take half the money out 
[02:19:00]  half for me  half for her  of the $40,000  that was all I had  in the whole world  and I go and fill out  a $20,000 withdrawal slip  you see where this is going  don't you  and I'm told  Ms. Kumia  the account is closed  there's nothing in there  oh well what happened  oh yes  the other account holder  took out  and I was going there  to take $20,000 out  half  and she  because you're a nice guy  and then she took that  and then I still had to pay  her legal fees  and support  and I'm like  but wait a minute  she took $40,000 
[02:19:30]  but Bobby  Bobby was so in love  like it was so  it was so like  he had that thing in his neck  like what do you  like you know  you know when you squint your neck  and you can see a heart  on the side of it  we share everything  he had no idea  had no idea  and they finally stopped that  when she got disgusted  with the amount he was putting in  she was like  I'm not fucking  she asked for a prenup  let's relax  you don't make that money 
[02:20:00]  oh man  that was just not nice  yo  I'm fucking happy  to see y'all man  it's good to see you man  I'm always happy  I've been watching  Roots on BET  Jesus  I was watching  Jesus  what the fuck  what is a fucking racist  what just happened  want to get some cream  for his hands  what just happened  I was saying  let me tell you  I saw some old  Amos and Andes  and it was fabulous  during the commercials  I was watching Black Week  on BET  Jesus

[02:23:00]  but he bet Keith  that he would have  only X amount of yards  and Keith's like  no he'll have this many  touchdowns  but he got hurt  the first game of the season  but Keith didn't think  that he owed the money  but you did owe the money  because you know  that's the risk you take  and you say he won't have  X amount of touchdowns  if he gets hurt  too bad  let me give you  the funniest story  about Keith  and Keith  he's going to kill me  tomorrow  for telling me this story  but it's the best thing ever  this is like  three years ago  right  so Keith calls me  on the phone  he's like  stupid  he's like

[02:24:30]  what do you mean  Keith is a fucking jackass  oh that's fucking funny  remember the roast  when he thought he'd walk in  and just wing it  oh wow  that was brutal  and Ben Bailey  was that Patrice's roast  yes  Ben Bailey had prepared  for months  to do this roast  and Keith just came in  what's up  Ben Bailey annihilates  his best joke ever  was Keith Robinson  takes a lot of comics  like Kevin Hart  under his wing  and then little Kev 
[02:25:00]  ripped that wing off  and flew to Hollywood  with it  and now Keith  is stuck between  Philly and New York  going in circles  yeah Keith has one wing  and he's going in a circle  between Philly and New York  that was the funniest  funniest roast joke ever  I mean  oh that's great  the place fucking popped  and then Keith comes in after  and he didn't know  Ben just annihilated  and he was bombed  he was late  he walked in the door  right up to the podium  just to fucking go up  and he was just wing it  and he started off 
[02:25:30]  with some dumb red buttons joke  what's up everybody  what's up  why are we roasting this guy  why  and all the people to roast  why are we roasting Patrice  this is the best part  when Keith knew he was bombing  then he reached in his pocket  took out a dirty napkin  with like  a half a joke written on it  and tried to read it  with his stupid old eyes  real quick  let me see here  what do we got here  oh man

[02:34:30]  I'm gonna need a nap  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  this is the O.P. and Anthony Show  I'm in chains  love that song  fucking Drew Boogie  that's available on iTunes  by the way  Drew Boogie's newest hit  I'm in chains  it's a hit  love that  and boy  the message is  right on the mark  right on point  that's what I was gonna say 
[02:35:00]  it's right there  that message  I'm in chains  I'm in chains  thank you  I love it  because I can't say  what I want to say  although I do anyway  what am I talking about  I say everything  I want to say  especially home  and the privacy  of my own home  or my car  with the windows rolled up  oh boy do I say  what I want to say  say it a few minutes  from the back  all right  yeah that probably  wouldn't be a good idea  right 
[02:35:30]  yeah  I know how to fuck up  it'd be a great idea  for this radio show  and for us  oh  because I would be  knocked unconscious  just to see  if you're really  going to use that gun  or not  a big giant  see if he  puts you to the test  a giant fist  coming right from my face  oh boy  he's a nice man though  yeah  yeah  coming in on his birthday  it is his birthday  it is yeah  that's crazy  that's good  when is the fight  by the way  I don't know  by the bye  he's partners  with Golden Boy 
[02:36:00]  right  yes he is  the fight is  I don't know  I guess we'll ask him  wait hold on  it's going to be on HBO  oh it's March  oh  he's fighting  an undefeated guy  light heavyweight world champion  Tavares Thundercloud  I have not followed boxing  Thundercloud  yeah  Indigen  I guess that was on purpose  what  Cumulus probably  would not have been  a good nickname  ah  really  is his last name  Thundercloud  no his middle name 
[02:36:30]  is Thundercloud  his nickname is Thunder  oh  his last name is Cloud  his name is Tavares Cloud  oh  that's clever  Thundercloud  yes  okay  I don't know  I have no idea  I would have called myself  Turbulence  when going through the  take us out  you sweet kid  that's brilliant  take us out  you sweet kid  he is a nice jacket  didn't he  Jesus  that jacket  he just 
[02:37:00]  red sneakers  designer jeans  you can tell he's got money  yeah  that jacket  probably custom made  I can't believe he went through  a broke  after he had money  that's  frightening  yeah  to me  frightening  a lot of guys do that though  oh  no  no  that's it  Dan had that happen  imagine that  oh my god  that's a fucking nightmare  especially after  because Kevin didn't have that  after he hit big big  like  right  when Dane was  massive  after that 
[02:37:30]  is when all that shit happened  oh  imagine all that stuff you did  you built up  and then you fucking  get robbed  it's terrible  I mean it's just  it's terrible that it happened  yeah  cause um  you know  to fucking have that kind of money  and lose it  after all that shit happens  oh my god  that would be  awful  it's hard enough  to lose money  when you make a little bit of it  right  you know what I mean  like I don't know where Kevin was  when he lost it  but he was definitely not  where Dane was  cause he lost fucking millions man 
[02:38:00]  yeah  sucks  I could  it does suck  yeah  I couldn't imagine going  having to like  go to work again  like when people  they go broke  and  and then like  you had your retirement  like those people  that got fucked in the  in the  Ponzi schemes  and stuff like that  like  they had their retirement  it was all set  word  and then they have to like  in their 50s and 60s  get a job  what the fuck 
[02:38:30]  man  it's crazy  it's uh  it seems like a hard  like I'm always amazed  at comedians  I know that go back to school  or go back to work  or  I don't know how they do it  how do you leave this life  even if you're not  quote unquote  you're a huge celebrity  but  how do you go back  to fucking regular jobs  after that man  well some people have to  because they have to  get insurance  I mean insurance is crazy  I mean as you get older  you get sick  you get fucked up  and you  you know  that's why it sucks  being a comic  I mean the actors  at least as an actor  I'm in the  I'm in the  the guild  I'm in the  after I'm in SAG 
[02:39:00]  I'm in the writers guild  I have all this  uh  options for me  and you know  we have that  but comics  we don't have shit  no but I'm not saying  I don't know why they do it  like I get like  for practical reasons  I just mean the heartache  of having to do it  even if you need the insurance  I definitely get it  but to have to go back  and go  like you know  that that nightlife  unless you just learn  to hate it  it's petrifying  that's why I don't  fuck with cruise ship  guys anymore  I used to  I used to like being  oh that's such a shit  but it's not  because they're making  three grand  for two shows  and uh 
[02:39:30]  and they get to  support their families  and they're fucking  a lot of them  are on a ship  all the time  which is not  really the greatest  but if you  if you're single  and you want to  occasionally bang a chick  and you just  be on boats all the time  fucking flying all over  it's a lot worse lives man  but even if you have  a family  and you have a mortgage  and all this shit to pay  going on a boat  a couple times a month  and being away  is  it's better than  fucking getting a real job  you know  yeah I mean  I used to hate that  but now I get it  it's so  so sad 
[02:40:00]  you know  to have to  if you don't  like I do  this year  I had to pay  I had to pay  for the first time  regular insurance  because supposedly  I didn't make enough  because SAG and AFTRA joined  and SAG is cheaper  you have to make  a certain amount of money  to get insurance  right  SAG is cheaper than AFTRA  so I always had SAG  because you can make the money  and you get your residuals  and it just  it just comes in  this year  they joined  so I had to make  AFTRA money  or something like that  which was like  whatever 
[02:40:30]  thousands of dollars  last year  and I thought I did it  and then they were like  you didn't  so I had to pay  a thousand dollars a month  in insurance  instead of a hundred dollars  a month in insurance  wow  that's brutal  it was brutal  and then they finally came in  I told my wife  to call again  and they were like  oh you did make it  but I thought Obama  gave everyone  affordable health care  what happened  dude a thousand dollars  a month was like  wow  it's like  I'll figure it  but I'll do it  but you have to have health  you have to have it  you have to 
[02:41:00]  in your 40s  you have to have insurance  oh yeah  you're gonna start  you know when you're  in your 20s  it's not worth it  nah  who gives a turkey  you gotta go to the doctor  you just fucking  man  go to the doctor  fucking  not pay the bill  yeah  great  but yeah  when things start  falling apart on you  yeah you need that insurance  yeah you get a bump  on your asshole  you're fucking dirty  you bunch of  cum or something  oh Jesus Christ  you hear what I said  Bob  I heard you Chip  it's gotta be  it's funny  I've had a couple people 
[02:41:30]  tell me lately  like  do you know how great  your life is  like just people  who do whatever it is  they're doing for a living  and they're like  you're so fucking lucky  you get to say  whatever you want  for a living  and I guess  it sounds corny  but it's like  at times you get  because I get very depressed  in my life  but you know what I mean  it's like so stupid  and selfish  it's like  life is really good  because you compare yourself  to your peers  we're all peers  we all do the same thing  for a living  so it's not shocking  why do you compare yourself  to wear the boats  paw and stuff 
[02:42:00]  I meant Morgan  cocksucker  Jesus  yeah but you compare yourself  we compare ourselves  what we're doing  we're making it  and we're making money  you know  we live in the city  we have homes  we're paying  you know what I mean  it's pretty crazy  but then there's  that other like  Kev  where you don't have to  worry about it  forever  and your success  keeps you know  giving you more success  and like if Norton  got one yes  on a sitcom  that was a go  I mean he would  fucking  he'd be at that next level  I'm going too soon 
[02:42:30]  I can feel it  yes  I wrote a sitcom  it's about a man  who works  in a regular job  and he just comes home  and he says  regular guy things  I like it  how was work  you know  another day  another dollar  regular Joe  it's just called  regular Joe  regular Joe  or it should be called  like cup of Joe  and then it's like  the beginning starts  and it's a tilted  coffee cup  with Joe's face on it  yeah  like that  and he's just kind of like  bah  bah  cup of Joe  and the whole thing 
[02:43:00]  is I throw my hands up  what do you want from me  so it's like a half hour  yeah 30 minutes  half hour  six to one  half a dollar  and then you got  hey what's going on here  well who's this  that would be  little Kev's coming  to get his money back  Jesus  he just paid a couple guys  to get that money back  for me  he's going to break  your fucking legs  I'll give you 200  to go in and get that  fat guy  and get my money back  I broke my knee man  now we're going to see  the beat on E-Rock  for a second  oh  for his dumb movie idea  no just because  he's that fat guy  oh  I think I'd  probably rather watch  that movie than  regular Joe's sitcom 
[02:43:30]  you don't like  the idea for regular Joe  no  I don't like  having to spend  any time in the morning  with regular Joe  I would never invite him  do you not like regular Joe  no  he's so fucking annoying  you don't like  the tidbits of knowledge  he's just a regular guy  he's not a regular guy  sure he is  he just says regular guy things  he's annoying  you know what  you want it all handed to you  that's your problem Sammy  I don't even know  what you're talking about  I didn't ask for anything  yeah well  you don't ask  because you're too used to getting  what's he saying  it's regular Joe  he shoots from the hip  he shoots from the hip  it's like  he's going to give you 
[02:44:00]  a little wisdom  a little knowledge  and a little fun  I'm a straight shooter  I say it for your own good  a little tough medicine  that's not what I was talking about  tough medicine  I can't stand him  you know  you should use a little  elbow grease  things like that  yeah you can't stand him  because you don't like  hearing the truth  you just want to hear  like all that  all that soft stuff  mommy tells you  well that's not what Joe says  fucking regular Joe  man this is it  it's going to be a great show  I'm so fucking tired today  that just makes me angry  welcome to the real world  try working for a living buddy  fuck it see 
[02:44:30]  yeah I'm tired  what is it that you do Joe  for a living  I work on a construction site  give me a container of coffee  I'm happy  but you  what do you sleep all day  well this is what you get  welcome to the real world buddy  I hate him  I fucking hate him  I hate him because  I knew guys like this  they were on the job side  yeah yeah  before you forgot  where you came from  then we'll see  all of a sudden  Mr. Makes his millions of dollars  exactly  I don't need millions of dollars  you just sit me in front of the TV  I'm happy  could you imagine Norton  losing it all  and having to get a real job  I mean what would you do 
[02:45:00]  the tantrums  what would I do  I'd get up and work for a living  that's what I'd do  what would he do  yeah I don't know  I would do  I'll tell you  I'll tell you what I did  Pergaments  I worked as a  Caldor  Caldor  I worked as a forklift operator  I remember Caldor  I worked at Caldor  I could drive any fork and thing  I almost said fucking  I worked at  oh you can't  Pergaments  oh no  Pergaments  my nickname was Toast  why  I used to love that nickname 
[02:45:30]  when I was  because I would go out  this is like 86  85  we would work  what they called  Iron Days  which were like  9 in the morning  until 9  it was a 12 hour shift  like you do two of them  what were you taking  the wrinkles out of the shirts  oh god no  you were taking  your pilfer  your magnesium  in your bones  it was  you would have  regular days  which was I think  I like that  that's a terrible  fucking nickname  it is  I had a terrible nickname  T-bone  I gave myself  a nickname  shades 
[02:46:00]  I want to know  why toasting  that's because  everyone next to you  was standing here  oh that's terrible  oh that's awful  that was a good one  it was  so Jimmy  okay  you did  Pergaments  you did  that  your nickname  was Toast  oh I was just  working  yeah  it was going to be  in a home  fucking houseware store  and paint  and all that stuff  so I would go out  I would go out  for dinner  on these long days  and come back  an hour later  and I would be stoned  so this guy Frank 
[02:46:30]  who was my manager  would always say  that he was toasted  and they would just  start calling me Toast  and that was my nickname  for a few years  all bloodshot  and red  yeah  but I was just  stoned  stoned Jimmy  must have been  fucked in  I can't even imagine  and they would actually  page you like that  toast  come to paint  toast  you didn't think  that was a problem  no  that you were called Toast  I liked my nickname  a lot  you did  yeah  you think you'd do  something like that again  if you lost it all  motivational speaking  oh yeah  there you go  what  whatever  who are you gonna  motivate  worms  dig in that dirt 
[02:47:00]  get in there  I don't know  what I would do  Toast  you never felt bad  about being called Toast  like you're a stoner  no I loved it  I like it  I thought it was cool  yeah I like it  yeah Toast  yeah I mean  if you're smoking weed  hey what's up Toast  what's up man  and I didn't ask  for the nickname  they just gave it to me  Toast  I would have called you  Jam  you know  it goes with the Toast  you call me whatever you want  just don't call me late for supper  my friend regular Joe  told me that one  tracks up every time he says it 
[02:47:30]  of course he did  the guy on the job site  that was like this regular Joe  his name was Mike  and he fucking  he was the guy  I know Mikey  good people  no he's  oh he knows Mike  of course he knows Mike  good people  it was  the lunch  our lunch break  was  45 minutes long  from noon  to 1245  and he  like at 1245  he'd stand up  and  he wouldn't even like  give us five more minutes  or just be like  hey guys  you know  we're gonna start working again  but 
[02:48:00]  he'd stand up and say  and this fucking  like every time I heard it  I wanna kill him  alright guys  suit up  suit up  that's right  get back to work  like put your fucking  tool belt back on  your little  your drill screw apron  and boy Mike  suit up  suit up  I feel for every dude  listening  who has a lunch break  yes  that you get  allotted time  to fucking  you have from  12 to 1  or 12  that's it  1245  and then you have to go back 
[02:48:30]  back  it's  it's  fucking  the worst feeling  in the world  is when you had to go back  yes  that last second  and then all of a sudden  you're like  you're looking  it's like fucking  it's like school  it's like you've been in school  your whole fucking life  and you never get out  yeah  you're always  too bad  it doesn't seem like  you learn much  it is that regimented  lifestyle of  going to work  the lunch break  and then  it's like fucking  yeah  the bell rings  you go to lunch  you come back  ah no  I am so fucking 
[02:49:00]  happy  and I feel very  lucky  for this job  here because  that working for a living  shit  stinks  yeah  you can't  man  you gotta  you gotta give  those guys credit  some people  don't even get  like  an hour  yeah  they got like  a half hour  yeah  half hour  some people  eat at the desk  because they have  so much work to do  they can work  through lunch  it's amazing  it's a working lunch  there was a guy  named Sandy  who was like  in his 50s  and he was  still  suiting up 
[02:49:30]  and working  swinging a fucking hammer  Sandy's good people  you like Sandy  I like Sandy  he works hard  never complains  yeah  suit up  when you're told to  and him and Mike  would sit around  and talk about  other jobs  that they were on  like that was  their whole fucking life  even their leisurely  conversations  were like  remember that fucking  track job  we had  back in  86  we had  let me tell you  this one  sit down guys  let's see  there were  about 20 units  right  and they delivered  a tin  and now we gotta hang  you know  the tin  in all the 
[02:50:00]  various units  and they forgot  to send  the slips and drives  so there we are  regular Joe finds that  funny  I heard this story  go ahead  so there we are  bending slips and drives  by hand  you know  so we gotta get  the job done  but we got it done  didn't we get it done  Mike  yeah we got it done  a little over budget  but hey  I'm coming out of my pocket  I ain't one of the millionaires  it was horrible  to sit there and go  oh my god  this is gonna be my life  I fuck it  I fucked up  I fucked up 
[02:50:30]  and that's me  yeah but back then  did you  you didn't see yourself  doing that  doing this  no  you saw yourself doing that  right  you were trying to figure out  how you were going to get  out of doing that  right  did you hate that  I hated it  every day  I would be like  oh my god  that's me  that's gonna  I don't wanna do this  I don't like this  and it was  it was terrible  and then when I finally got  started working with 
[02:51:00]  Opie at BAB  I would still be  I would like  oh I was doing  the morning show also  with Bob Buckman  and I would  like come in for an hour  before work  and do the radio show  and then he would  replay some of the stuff  later on in the day  while I was at work  so I'd have BAB on  I'm in an attic  swaying  and fucking cutting myself  and suiting up  and I'd hear myself  on the radio  thinking like  I thought once you  you know  your voice was on the radio  in any capacity  you were done doing this  and there I am  like on the radio  but still working  did that give you hope though 
[02:51:30]  like you know  it kind of gave me hope  but it also made me think like  oh my god  what do I have to do  where I don't have to do this anymore  it's not just getting on the air  obviously  but you understand  like I have these carpenters  at my house  these two guys  are they singing songs  no not those carpenters  it was a long day right  that's very  yes  of course  but they're building  these stairs  and this bench  over my  one skinny woman  in a fag  they're building  these stairs  and they literally  from scratch  just designed this thing  yeah 
[02:52:00]  and they love  what they do  there are people  that love it  there's some people  that love  laying down a cement floor  and evening it out  and I did that floor  and I  one with a trowel  in their hand  yeah like these guys  making my  I mean  it amazes me  that there was nothing there  and then 20 minutes later  there's a frame  like who  how the fuck  did you learn how to do that  no not that type of frame  it's another type of frame  you know what I mean  like these guys are great  yeah  yeah 
[02:52:30]  and they love it  you can see  like see that they love it  I've seen people that love it  and I always thought  they had to be stupid  cause who would love that  like you gotta aspire  to do something else  you can't  this has to be  what will happen to you  if all else fails  this guy looked at  like this guy looked at my kitchen  and was like  oh it's nice  I wish I got this job  cause you know this guy  loves making kitchens  he loves  like looking at the bench  I made that bench  from nothing  there was nothing there 
[02:53:00]  and I created  maybe when you're a craftsman  like that  when you're just working  construction on like  a tracked job  where it's just  20 units  of the same fucking thing  every day  you never drove down  around the neighborhood  with a chair guy  put that AC unit in  right there  I actually do say  they didn't have  they had radiators in there  driving around Long Island  I do occasionally point out  you know  by the way  you see all the units  on that roof  I put all those up there  yeah  I do the same thing  yeah  I'll show some people  you know  you see that building 
[02:53:30]  over there  if it wasn't for me  they'd all have rain  on their heads  you're welcome  the unoiled wheel  squeaks the loudest Joe  you're welcome  squeaky wheel  gets the grease  what does that mean  that didn't really  fit in the conversation  squeaky wheel  gets the grease  you want something  you squeak a little bit  they give you the grease  what do you want  I hate regular Joe  I want to fucking  sledgehammer  his side of his skull  yeah I want you  sledgehammer  the damn railroad  work while  live long day  what  nothing for a living  tell you dumb jokes  help no one  I mean what we do 
[02:54:00]  though  telling jokes  this show is fucking retarded  it is  I did it two days in a row  I'm exhausted today  I can't think  I'm trying to stay in the game  I don't know how you guys  do this every day  and stand up at night  oh  that's right  Jimmy does that  Jimmy is a machine  he is a fucking machine  a mediocrity machine  a big fucking kid  I get to a certain point  and I slink away  like a fucking zilch  like a slug  as soon as you get  success is salt  and I'm a slug 
[02:54:30]  trying to cross it  oh fuck Jimmy  yeah that's  it is  like after  by Friday  like sometimes  you wake up in the morning  and go like  I honestly  did nothing yesterday  last night  I'm going into work  there's a few news stories  but I don't have shit  to talk about  I got nothing  yeah it's crazy  yeah and then you realize 
[02:55:00]  it's like  alright you just  gotta crack the mics  and fucking start yapping  about something  here's what's hard  about what he does  like he said  he does this  but then he does  shows every night  and our shows  we choose to do them  it's self motivated  you don't have to go  to the cellar  it's  I had to force myself  to go back to the cellar  because  I love hanging out  with my chick  I go to my cellar  for beers afterwards  that's what I do  how about you go  to buy a  oh that's a good one  but like 
[02:55:30]  for Jim to motivate himself  to go down every night  is  because you get  any night you can go  I don't need to go  yeah that  I can't imagine  how you guys  motivate yourself  to  as soon as you get  as soon as you get a girl  though  and you move in  or live with a girl  when that happens  maybe move again  you'll stay  you'll stay home  but I tell you man  I want to shoot  another hour  I want to shoot  immediately  and it's like  I thought that sometimes  like you go down  and you work on  Bobby knows the process  you work on shit  and all of a sudden  you got a new 15 minute hunk  where you go to another club  and then you start 
[02:56:00]  bringing that out  and then before you know it  you got fucking 35  40 new minutes  that's amazing  do you actually  consciously  count minutes  like are you going like  alright I got another  four from last night  it's in 15 minute increments  yeah  the cellar's weird like that  like that's how I build material  or other clubs  where I'll do  you fucking  all of a sudden  you notice  like I'm working on something now  and like you put it  in different pieces of the act  when you go on the road  but it's a new 15 minutes  because all of a sudden  I like to go up  and just do a whole new  the cellar actually  I mean 
[02:56:30]  this last weekend  at Bananas  was some of the best shows  I've done  really  I mean ever  because of the cellar  I've been going to the cellar  a lot again  yeah  and I stopped going to the cellar  I was on the road a lot  but now for the last  couple months  I've been back at the cellar  that place is just magical  it polishes your act  you get so much  even just little nuggets  of things  at the end of something  and it makes it  so much  so much better  and then you go on the road  and do your hour  and it's like  what the fuck  you have so much confidence 
[02:57:00]  going up on stage  yeah  there's nothing better  than doing new shit  nothing better  than when you retire  eating fucking hot girl ass  come on  that's pretty good  there's a few things  better than doing new shit  actually  it's in the middle  what about taking a shit  and then itching your asshole  later that night  that doesn't do much to me  when there's a little  when that hemorrhoid itch  oh  it's the best itch ever  no I don't  a fucking dirty hemorrhoid itch  or having  oh it's almost  it's almost orgasmic 
[02:57:30]  having cranky ass  and being able to take  the midday re-wipe  oh yeah  with a tux  a tux  a nice tux  medicated pad  yeah I don't need all that  I'm not a big on issue  of my asshole  do you have a two knuckle  your asshole  while you're cleaning  with a tux  clean as a whistle  on Jimmy  your asshole  yeah  I have a clean asshole too  you don't  yeah I do  I have a bidet  I can open up my asshole  and clean inside  I'm running low on underwear  because  sometimes I just have to

[03:02:00]  go out with the family  I'll eat  I'll see my daughter  no I don't eat that  I don't eat that  when it's not a birthday  really  no I don't  I'll just go and chill  probably go watch a movie  and just relax  because I got training tomorrow  camp started for me  two weeks ago  man  far as  the boxing part  far as  that's a lot of dedication  to like  you're pretty much  giving up  what people perceive  as fun  man I didn't give up  so many  anniversaries  so many  holidays  and Christmas  being in camp  for 28 years  of boxing 
[03:02:30]  or 27  1988  so  I'm kind of  used to it  you know what I mean  but in the same token  you know  you do like  sit back  oh man I can go here  I can go here  but you know  I can go and have  in my mind  my birthday can be  after March 9th  okay right right  in my mind  I'm going to go to the beach  a win will be a nice present  right there  exactly  hell yeah  but you know you're not a sacrifice  you do it  you do it  you do it  the times you got to be in here  when you know  you'd rather be somewhere else  yes  Monday through Friday 
[03:03:00]  6 to 10  I haven't sacrificed cake  in a long time  so he knows  that's the best thing  oh sorry  I guess it's just  become part of your life  to know that  there's certain things  you're just not  going to be able to do  and I'm a veteran  I'm old school  you know what I mean  I've been doing this  for too long  like a lot of things  that might bother  a younger guy  that's the pro right now  like in his 20s  temptations  are out there  oh man  it's my birthday  or it's Christmas  or it's this 
[03:03:30]  my son's birthday  my daughter's birthday  you know  I'm not  not that I'm  you know  I don't care  but it's like  I've lived that  I've been through that  I've worked my way  through it  been successful  so I don't have to  deal with those issues  that a younger guy  has to deal with  you know what I mean  that's away from his family  you're not emotionally  connected to that  exactly  I can go away  from my family  for 9 damn weeks  and I'll forget I'm married  did you though early on  was it tough  to get that discipline  early on  when you were a younger guy  to really  you know  to train hard  and stay away from  no I had a hard lesson 
[03:04:00]  in the state penitentiary  or graded for  oh yeah  well Jimmy did too  yeah  Jimmy did too  Jimmy did some time  in the pen  I did one  I did one night  in the tombs  and I am a good boy  ever since  that's fucking horrifying  and I've been good  ever since too  I've still 98  you understand  so that answer  your question  because I don't  glorify  the dark side  but the dark side  became light to me  because I learned  pieces  out of that experience  that's why  I'm so disciplined  and named 
[03:04:30]  and known  as being as disciplined  and focused  as I am  because I took  out of  the worst situation  that a person  probably can put  himself in  right  and I took  the good  out of that  yes I found  some good  out of that  and that really  fit like a glove  in my boxing career  are you actually  grateful you went  through that  I mean that's a hard  thing to actually  say  no it ain't  because  I'm just trying  to figure out  how to answer it  in the right way  you understand it 
[03:05:00]  without being too  long with it  which I probably  don't sweat it  listen  by knowing  not today  not five  ten years ago  way before then  but knowing  what is going  to benefit  how is going  to benefit me  in this game  in this sport  in my personal life  once you become  somebody  what kind of  adversity is going  to come to you  then  I mean it doesn't  get better  when you become  somebody of interest  whether it's money 
[03:05:30]  whether it's fame  whether it's fortune  it gets even worse  to me  it was part  of my destiny  right  so in hindsight  at the time  it must have  sunk  at the time  I was  a statistic  okay  inner city  black guy  in penitentiary  in a jail  okay  who's going  to do a movie  about that  big deal  you go to  Brooklyn  you can go  to Jamaica  Queens  you can go  to Philadelphia  D.C.  Maryland  you can find  that guy  you can find me  that story's been  done  but what you 
[03:06:00]  can't find  is  the after  fact  you can't  find  what came  out of that  often  which is me  that's what you  can't find  you can find  that story  from the beginning  right  right  but you  can't find  in 1988  in 2013  right now  you can't  find what's  in the middle  of that  often 
[03:06:30]  very few guys  go on  to have  this type  of a life  this amazing  life  they keep  making mistakes  and keep  staying  getting in trouble  and I've done that  in the juvenile system  I didn't burnt  the juvenile system  out so much  I was there  every week  and it was  it's a thing  like this man  it's like  I'm glad  that I haven't  fought no one  with the mentality  that I have  because  we both  won't be the same  right 
[03:07:00]  how do you  beat a guy  yeah man  I had some losses  didn't throw enough  punches  did throw enough  punches  just seen it  one way  I've seen it  one way  whatever  who cares  but  to beat a guy  spiritually  emotionally  and physically  that way  I would hate  to fight somebody  like Bernard Hopkins  because I win or lose  I won't be the same  because I know  what he's working with  I know what he's  bringing to the table  you're 48 today  and you're obviously 
[03:07:30]  completely  what's the difference  between a guy like you  or guys like  Meldrick Taylor  how do you avoid  having that type of injury  or fighters like  Ali  or guys that just  that came out of it  in worse shape  and here you are  with almost  it seems like  nothing has happened  to you  and still fighting  all these years later  and I have energy  and I  my personality  plays a part  but besides  the personality  of who I am  I think  a lot of it  has to do with 
[03:08:00]  you know  not that I know  anything about  Meldrick's lifestyle  or many other fighters  that we can mention  and you're absolutely  right about the analysis  but  I think  a lot of  with genetics  a lot of it  is the way  I took care of myself  earlier  like I invest  my money  I invested  in my life  and my body  when I was  in my 20s  late 20s  and my 30s  because I didn't  come home  from the penitentiary  to 25  I was considered  an old guy  trying to box  at 25  and I made  something out of it  so I've been  calling old  for about 27 years  Jesus  I believe 
[03:08:30]  that  everybody's body  is totally different  as you know  and I believe  you try to  avoid more punches  than you take  that helps too  the accumulations  of  a water  dripping on  this  will stain  it will eventually  work its way through  believe it or not  I don't know how long  but it will work  the wear and tear  of anything  just living  not taking punches  at all  wears your body out  then you leave  then you go back  in the ground  points at Bobby  during that by the way  yeah you go back 
[03:09:00]  so we pointed  yeah I had to point  oh yeah  this worn out body  exactly  so  hang on  hang on  whatever you say  Mr. Hopkins  I see you  gut punch him  Benoit  gut punch him  straight to me  I'm going to  cut first  then going to gun  but I  you know  I can  I am blessed  but I had to  work to be blessed  that makes sense  yes  I had to  work in  to be blessed  that means  that you know  instead of drinking  wine I drink water 
[03:09:30]  I juice  I take care of my body  if I don't have a fight  you'll catch me  not in the gym  getting hit  sparring and all that  I ain't that  deranged  I'm in the fitness gym  in the neighborhood  I'm in the steam room  I'm on a bike  I'm just  I like to sweat  I am addicted  to working out  I don't work out  to the point  where I look sick  I work out  because it became  a lifestyle  I feel good  I gotta burn off  some energy  I have to sweat  I've been doing it  for two decades  and a half  so when you walk around 
[03:10:00]  at 48 today  and you got 3% body fat  and you're straight  and I'm more 50  than more 40  right  you figure 36 months  from now  we'll be talking  I live half of my life  if I'm blessed  to live another 30  or 40 years  so right now  everything is a numbers game  you're born  you got a number  you die  you got a number  and everything in between  is what you build  as a legacy  for yourself  and that's life  so I look at everything  as like  not a philosopher  but I look at everything  and like  wait a minute  if I'm told 
[03:10:30]  by the old trainers  back in the day  not this teachers  not the teachers  that I was told  the trainers today  I was taught by teachers  there's a difference  trainer teacher  hit  and not get hit  oh  what  Bobby tell him  to get on the microphone  can you please  use the microphone  hit and not get hit  hit and not get hit  now it's impossible  not to get hit  at all  it's a fight  but to give your brain  to prove that  you can take one  to me  that is  plain stupid 
[03:11:00]  oh wow really  that is  yeah  and I use the word stupid  because at the end of the day  even if you be a crowd pleaser  because you're getting hit  and you're hitting him  and nobody has a defense  and offense  who's going to count your earnings  when it's all said and done  when you earn  so at the end  at the end  you're going to be sitting there  depending on  whoever  to  write your checks  count your money  you can't look behind 
[03:11:30]  your counting  because  your brain  now I'm already  putting myself at risk  if I'm the best  ducker  in the world of boxing  now if I just  give it up  and not be conscious of  try to catch one  try to duck one  try to roll with one  try to smother one  I was taught  from old school  I just stuck  in the new world  in the new time  when you got MMA  you got UFC  and you got the knockdown drag out  and when I get in there  and I show the fundamentals  of boxing  and I break the guys down  from the old science  of hit  and not get hit  I come across 
[03:12:00]  as being to some boring  I'm not exciting  because  I don't have a swollen eye  I don't have a bust  they never see me  knocked out  they never see me  beat up  they see me do  technical skills  and beat  and break a guy down  and there's a lot of guys  that was younger  than me  about 20 years  who haven't fought  and you're a fight fan  you know  the Jermaine Tellers  not kicking dirt on them  he's not around  Kelly Pavlik  these guys  was 20 something years  younger than me  not only did I beat them  in the ring  obviously  but I beat them  in motion 
[03:12:30]  I beat them physically  and I beat them spiritually  and they never bounce back  have you ever been  in the ring  where you're fighting  and thinking to yourself  holy shit  I'm getting hit  in the head  a lot more  than I like to  have you ever been  in that situation  where you're like  oh shit  I've been in a situation  in sparring  more than actually  in a fight  I've been blessed  with a small percentage  of this lucky  yeah yeah  I mean  think about it  maybe 70  low 70s  in fights  71  72 
[03:13:00]  I lost count  I've never been cut  in the ring  damn  what's the average number  I've never been cut  what's the average number  of jabs  because jabs  don't look like  it's such a thing  we're used to seeing  but that's a guy  punching in the face  yeah jabs look like  it's just setting up  for the big punch  but it really  I'm sure hurts  to get hit with a jab  they don't take that much  for your brain  to bounce around  in your skull  so a jab  is just  the jab is  you know  you got stiff jabs  you got  jabs is not normally  a knockout jab  a knockout punch rather  but in the same token 
[03:13:30]  would be to any of us  by the way  it's that  it's that  right  that tap  that leak  that you think  ain't a big deal  you know  the one in your house  yeah  you come back  two months later  yes  that leak  then did so much damage  that it might have cost  a thousand dollars  to get fixed  and you said  oh  and it cost ten thousand  why  because that leak  in that water  that's that jab  the repetitiveness  that's that jab  this  bam  that gets you  lights out  you know 
[03:14:00]  someone like that  quicker  but this  over the years  in sparring  the worst  believe it or not  the worst physical damage  is done in practice  ask football players  ask basketball players  that's where the tweaks  come in  that's when you  you're not really  when you're game  because it's not a game yet  oh wow  and so you're not really  like you know  you're not  and then you  you got to practice  so practice is near the game  but it's not the game  and you sort of get  a little bit  a little relaxed  and so you're in the ring 
[03:14:30]  you ever see  you've been  she got sparring  in the ring  and you know  that was a great correction  you were going to say  you guys are sparring  he goes  you've seen guys  sparring  exactly  your nose is kind of straight  so I know you've never been  in a sparring match  you know  you've got to have a lump  on your nose  to be in a sparring match  and to me  that's completely correct  that's pretty straight  why don't you put one  on his face for him  I've been waiting to do that  oh my god  the girls he dates  have lumps in their throat  that's about it  so in practice  plus aren't you  at times sparring 
[03:15:00]  with a guy who has something  he wants to prove  that you know  he wants to kind of  like when Holmes  was sparring with Ali  doesn't he sometimes  your sparring partner  want to kind of step up  because he's fighting  the champion  well if you're a smart guy  and you're a champion  you want to fight  someone that's going  to push you  so I do want the guys  to come with  the little chip  on their shoulder  you know  they want to kick my ass  for bragging rights  right  I mean can you imagine  a lot of fighters  made Larry Holmes  made they  not career  but made people  stop  man you know 
[03:15:30]  Larry just got  Larry Holmes  whooping Ali's ass  you know what I'm saying  so listen  it's not like Vegas  and boxing gyms  in America  you know  which happens in the gym  stays in the gym  you get knocked  on your ass  in the gym  I ain't knocked  Bernard Hopkins  down in the gym  that's big  that's big kudos  and then first of all  everybody want to know  who did it  he might have  a contract waiting  he might want to  have somebody  looking at him  a career can be built  on this  has that ever  happened to you  in the sparring  no  because I 
[03:16:00]  I know how  not because it can't happen  it's just for so many years  I had guys coming in  they want to show me  how tough they is  and they wing  wing wing wing  and I haven't beat  every round in sparring  you know what I mean  I had a couple of  bloody nose  but I've seen  that in the gym  especially Phil Luffy  was known for  ruining your career  before  it counts  in the gym  so I don't want  the guys to be  light on me  because I'd give them  a thousand dollars  if they can knock me down  Nazeem Richardson  is outside 
[03:16:30]  in my trainer  you know Nazeem  with the hat  yeah Nazeem  and Nazeem  well you don't do  that in the corner  that's how he did  do it in the corner  in the third round  it was kind of rough  but listen  we give the guys  a thousand dollars  if they can  put me on my ass  and he gets  on them  he gets on them  if they being  too respectful to me  really  what  yeah  that's not  going to help me  Travis Cloud  Travis Cloud  is going to be  trying to knock  my head off  and I'm sparring 
[03:17:00]  for nine weeks  with a guy  like boom  you alright champ  oh right right  you cool champ  you want him  to come in on you  and sometimes  they don't even  say nothing  they just come up  and hit you  and like  because they don't  want you to respond  or they figure  oh you alright  come on  you gotta send him home  you don't even try  to talk to a guy  like that  you can't reason  with him  because in his mind  he's already  too respectful  you don't want him  looking at you  as the champ  you want him  looking at you  as a guy  he wants to knock out  because that's how  you fucking  I want him to look  at me as a champ  but I want him  to look at me  as a person  that he has  to go ahead  and try to embarrass 
[03:17:30]  and beat me up  much as he can  and most guys  that you have  to find like that  you must find  the guys  that have careers  themselves  you can't find  a punching bag  with arms  to think  like a guy  that's a contender  who's 10  15 year younger  can spawn partners  I fight  but I'm going  to be their father  so it's best  for me  to find a guy  that has a career  won a career  and already  has  the  be eager 
[03:18:00]  to make a name  for himself  and then it keeps  me on my cue  it keeps you  on my cue  hey listen  you in a 90 foot  tightrope  would you be  more careful  if it was a net  underneath you  or would you be  extremely careful  if it wasn't one  is that a rhetorical  question  let me think  I think I'd be  more careful  without a net  I would just root  for whoever  was on the  fucking wire  because I wouldn't  be  I'd be on the  side of the  building  cowering  what can your 
[03:18:30]  trainer tell you  after all these  years  by the way  we promote  the fight  yeah  watch your knife  yes  Brooklyn  29th  world championship  fight  it's in Brooklyn  I didn't realize  that  come on man  we're right  next door to you  Brooklyn live  on HBO  oh wow  the Barclay Center  okay over at  Barclays  oh my god  that's great  you know I made  history in Madison  Square Garden already  so I figured I'd  spread it to love  yeah spread it to  Brooklyn  you know it was  Trinidad and then  2001  you know  now we had to  you know  listen Barbara  Streisand is  considered a legend  right  she's a legend  I've heard 
[03:19:00]  how are you going  to have a  Barbara Streisand  which I love her  but you know  you got to have  a boxing legend  the Christian  you know  Jay-Z had his  concerts there  he's a legend  you know what I mean  so and he's still  doing his thing  so I figured  hey you know  we have a great  relationship with  the people that  runs and  and own the  Barclays Center  Golden Boy Promotion  boxing shows  I'm ready  let's get in there  Brooklyn  what can your  trainer tell you  after all these  years like  is there anything  that like  what is it that  a trainer can tell 
[03:19:30]  a guy who's  got the career  you have  like something  you're still  doing wrong  or something  that you're  what is it  that they can  help you with  I don't believe  it's nothing  I'm still doing  wrong because  I won't be  doing it wrong  no more  once he spotted  it  not the first  but the second  definitely the third  time  Nazeem Richardson  is a reminder  and also is a guy  that still  continues to add  on things that  I might have  thought at one  time in my  career life  that I knew  everything  which I never 
[03:20:00]  really thought  that way  but when you get  to a point where  you've done  this and you've  done that  and you made  history more than  one time  which I have  that can  actually  be a mental  comfort zone  Nazeem  he derails  that  he makes  things be  to the point  where  forget  what you  accomplished  forget what  you done 
[03:20:30]  yesterday  is now  you gotta look  at this  he wants  your name  he wants  a piece  of your legacy  and to get  a piece  of my legacy  you have  to do  what no  one has  done  to Bernard  Hopkins  in 28  years  but winning  against Bernard  Hopkins  if you win  in grand  fashion  that has  to be looked  at as  who did  that  and so  I realize  what comes  to the table  that keeps  me more  alert than  really anything 
[03:21:00]  that I face  in the last  three or four  years of my  career  and as I  stay in the  game  winding down  very soon  to a point  where  it becomes  more of a  risk  because  when it  pays  churn every  year  like New  Year's  you lose  something  you don't  look around  to try to  figure out  what you  lost  you don't  have to  figure it  out  it will  let you  know  how do  you adjust  to that  how do  you  camouflage  that  so the  next guy  you definitely 
[03:21:30]  won't tell  no one  but they  are watching  and they've  been watching  me for  over 10  years  and I'm  being mild  with the  10s  because if  you take  10 years  off from  48  then you  know I'm  considered as  an athlete  especially a  boxer still  considered old  do you have  do you have  plans for  post career  post boxing  career  have you thought  about that  well no  because I don't  have no plans  the plans  has already  been done  and the plans  has been  established  years ago  I mean  I'm a guy  to think 
[03:22:00]  ahead  and way  before I got  to this point  in my career  and I mean  many many  years  I've set  up  one of my  business partners  Phil Stern  from Philadelphia  yeah  Stern  it's been  around  me for  many many  years  and so  many properties  in good areas  in Philadelphia  that support  my lifestyle  to be honest  with you  and second  not because  I don't have  no money  it's because  I've done  the right  things  second  being with 
[03:22:30]  Golden Boy  six years  ago  when people  say hey  I can't  fight  be a partner  it's two  years later  it ain't  gonna work  Bernard is  this  Bernard is  that  or Dola  is that  the company  is not  gonna last  now  it's a  different  story  six years  in  and I'm  a shareholder  and also  a respectful  percentage  of the  company  I can't  get into  the details  but I  know  that  setting up  boxing  setting up  business  before boxing  or after  boxing  it has  to be  done  and 90%  of us  don't do  that 
[03:23:00]  second  third  I mean  I feel  like I'm  always  got a  hustle  in me  in a  positive  way  I mean  some of  the greatest  businessmen  and some  of the  most smartest  businessmen  has been  guys that  came from  the streets  that I  came from  Curtis  Jackson  50 Cent  Jay-Z  and I  can name  many  many  more  you know  I figure  that out  of the  boxing world 
[03:23:30]  you know  you got  George Foreman  with the  grill  you had  Magic Johnson  after basketball  you know  properties in  Philadelphia  properties  probably in  New York  no one in  boxing  Larry Holmes  did in  Eastern  has took  it to the  level that  I'm planning  on taking  it to  based on  it can  be a  transformation  from  you know  your sport  especially  boxing  or boxers  because we're  not used  to making  those transitions  that damn  grill is a  hard thing  to beat  that damn  grill  oh man 
[03:24:00]  it's not  like you're  right  but my  thing is  I think  I can  really tell  people  you know  at least  give them  a blueprint  on  how  to  extend  your life  through  health and  awareness  through  eating the  right things  taking care  of your  body  getting the  proper rest  I think  right now  that I  am the  poster boy  for how  to give  yourself a  better chance  to see your  grandkids  grow up  to learn  how to  keep  that work 
[03:24:30]  mentality  get up and  walk steady  driving two  blocks to the  store  you know  I think I  can bring  that  because the  big question  is you're  48 and you're  still doing  this  you look  great  you speak  well  you talk  well  like what  is your  secret  there's  no secret  there's  time  patience  and  years  that went  by  that I  plan  ahead  I'm a  planner  and I  tell people  the last  time I  didn't  plan  I did  5 to  15  years  in the  penitentiary  because I  didn't have  a plan  I knew  what I 
[03:25:00]  wanted  to do  but I  didn't  have a  plan  B  now I'm  not saying  thank God  I didn't  have a  plan  B  and now  I try  to plan  every  big and  small  thing  pertaining  to my  life  do you  sleep  well  I'm a  terrible  sleeper  I  go to bed  at 10  o'clock  and I'm  up at  530  I sleep  well  not right  to sleep  depending on  how hard  I work  but I  think a lot  my mind  constantly  going about  other things  and what to  do  not necessarily  business  it could be  about the  fight  it could be 
[03:25:30]  about the  strategy  it could be  about something  that came up  through that  day that I  gotta think  about  then I  gotta let  it go  because  when you  think  while you're  resting  you're not  really resting  you're burning  energy  your senses  are still  up  but you're  laying down  resting  is your  mind is  somewhere in  the ocean  your mind  is somewhere  here in  the breeze  with your  eyes closed  and you're  just meditating  and I  want to mention  something too  y'all know  how great  Joe Frazier  was  yes  right  yeah  and you  know  being an  unachiever 
[03:26:00]  being most  of the  smallest guys  at that  time of  him fighting  the biggest  and the  baddest guys  in his  era  fill up  your guy  we are  already  80%  done  on  getting  him  the  statue  that  has  already  been  established  by  Philadelphia  Mayor  Michael  Nutter  we are  going to  along with  my  hopefully  partners  Goldenboy 
[03:26:30]  not other  people  that's  coming  on  to  finalize  the statue  that's  going to  be  presented  in  Philadelphia  where the  old  spec room  used to  be at  which you  know  down there  near the  spec room  used to  be all  the fights  there  they're  going to  develop  that whole  thing  sort of  like the  Staples  Center  type of  look  stadium  and I  suggested  years ago  about two  years ago  that that  be the  perfect  place  to put  the 
[03:27:00]  Joe  Frazier  statue  it's  going to  be great  man  we're  going to  do  that  is  at  frazierstatute.com  I'll say  again  frazierstatute.com  and we're  going to  when I say  we  Goldenboy  myself  the city  already  stepped up  at least  80%  already  and we're  going to  present  that  and the  proceeds  from my  fight  is going  to  make sure  that  the final  payment  is done  because I'm  from Philly  and you know 
[03:27:30]  what  I'm a  product  of Joe  Frazier  because  I might  not want  a statue  but to  walk  five or  six  seven  years  you know  I see  the Rocky  statue  as an  inspiration  it's not  too far  from my  condom  it's an  inspiration  so I don't  look at  Rocky  statue  as being  a boxing  statue  I look  at Rocky  statue  as being  a blue  collar  worker city  like Philadelphia  hard nose  come from  the bottom  come up  I look at  the movie  as a message  I don't get  into the  politics  he wasn't  really a  fighter  and all that  the message 
[03:28:00]  I get  from that  was that  this is a  guy that  wasn't  super talented  like an  Ali  this is a  guy that  wasn't  a guy that  know how to  speak  real great  in the  cameras  but this  came  raw  natural  South Philly  type of  thick accent  from Italian  and it  showed that  he came  from nowhere  people  people loved  it  and they  loved it  and they  loved to  get up  and fight  after you  got knocked  down  just like  in life  just like  in anything  so I  take that  inspiration 
[03:28:30]  from that  but Joe  Frazier  we have  a real  live  Rocky  in the  Joe  Frazier  and I'm  glad that  the city  and I'm  glad that  private  donators  and a lot  of other  people  they came  too  man  because  this is  going  big  I'm  had Jackie  at the  website  again  Frazier  statue  dot com  I think  Frazier  got a bad  rap  because  Ali  was so  loved  and then  you see  Thriller  in Manila  that's  special  about  the  fight  and  you  really  like  you  love  Frazier  more  after that  you're  like  wow  man  Ali  really 
[03:29:00]  gave him  a hard  time  like  Frazier  was not  badly  and you  know  what  I  can't  speak  for  Ali  but  I've  mentally  bruised  people  too  because  you  want  the  edge  and  let me  tell you  something  when you  want to  win  in this  sport  and  again  I'm  not  defending  Ali  but  I  can  relate  you know  what  I mean  I look  at things  I've  done  that I  felt  that  was kind  of risky  as I  started  looking  over the  years  but  when you  want to  win 
[03:29:30]  and you  try to  win  you're  very  selfish  about  anybody's  feelings  or  confident  you're  coming  man  I'm  telling  you're  coming  with  something  that  people  can't  understand  because  they're  not in  that  position  to  understand  and you  can't  blame  them  for  not  understanding  but  again  I'm  only  speaking  about  I  went  to  Puerto  Rico  and  I  started  all  not  rioting  and I  got a lot  of  Spanish  friends  and  me  Garcia  the two  time  champion  who's 
[03:30:00]  fighting  Zap  Judah  February  9th  at the  Barclays  in Brooklyn  he's  Spanish  and we're  cool  but  if I  thought about  it  and think  about it  now  I  pit  a lot  of  people  in  jeopardy  including  myself  and it  can carry  long  for  decades  people  can  still  feel  some  kind  of  weight  about it  they're telling us  you have to wrap  the fight  they're telling us  you have to leave  and we're done  anyway  our show is over  it's of course  here in Brooklyn  at the Barclays 
[03:30:30]  Center  it is  March the 9th  and Bernard is  fighting  Travis Cloud  and  29th  world championship  fight  you're one  of my  favorite  people  to have  in here  so  thank you  man  we love  you  thank you  so much  thanks  I'm still  talking  clear  right  100%  man  yeah  thank you  where you  going to be  Bobby  I'm going to be at  the comedy works  in Albany  this weekend  sides put  its temper  next  and then at the end  of the month  Gotham Comedy Club  go to riotcast.com  for my you know what  dude podcast

[03:58:00]  have  really  here's  what I  get  from  Sal  from  an  outsider's  point  of  view  I  walk  in  he's  polite  he's  not  too  friendly  he's  not  an  asshole  but  whatever  you need  he gets  no  problems  and he's  dressed  well  he looks  good  he has  his  shit  together  physically  that's  where  he  tricks  everybody  he dresses  well  and ties  himself  up  but  he's  terrible  he's  got  no  work  ethic  and  he  doesn't  mind  just  doing  the  bare  minimum  so 
[03:58:30]  it's  an  illusion  this  is  his  Clark  Kent  outfit  and  behind  this  he's  a  piece  of  shit  he rips  off  that  button  down  shirt  and  there's  just  a 
[03:59:00]  nice  nice  to meet  you  too  there  was  a  lady  in  here  last  week  that  was  kind  of  just  a  yapper  and a  self  indulgent  Nicole  whoa  did you hear that Eric  I was told that  Roland needs to leave  that's what I  you told me  you were like  tell him to get out  why  Roland's grace  he's a distraction  I said  don't talk to Roland  because he starts  talking shit  that doesn't make any sense  he's not the nicest  he hit me with his pass  that one time 
[03:59:30]  remember that  I don't know what you're  never apologized  I want to know  why Eric snapped  I heard it through  soundproof glass  I heard screaming  before you walked in  can I first introduce myself  to the ONA people  I'm Madison from  First Wave  Alt Nation  been here 10 years  I wanted to come  I love that show  by the way  which one  it's so weird  I love that  First Wave  the channel  it's my favorite  fucking channel  you had no idea  who I was  I actually heard you  you play music 
[04:00:00]  from  The Smiths  yeah  I'm not even saying  this  this is so weird  I'm not saying this  you're very feminine  right now  my hands are  not me physically  maybe we're older  than you  I fucking was listening  to this  this summer  up in New Hampshire  hiking  I was listening to that  it was fucking great  it's good  it's my favorite channel  we love this  I love the Smiths  and old YouTube  and stuff like that  it's good stuff  yeah you play a lot  of great music  it's a wonderful thing  god there's a lot  of talking over each

[04:01:00]  like a few years back  when I would skulk about  and I would go on  everybody's show  that's not nice  were you a minute ago  you said you were older than me  I would go on like  every show  I would pop about  and be on every show  this one he skulks about  he's got like 18 shows  and I'm like what  let me come on his show  can I say this though Madison  he wants to be where you're at  what  he wants to make the money  I make  okay maybe that's the difference  because where Madison is at  I don't know  the money Madison makes  I might not have as many  twitter followers  does she have her own show  or is she playing the hits  what  what the fuck
