<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, punctuated by recurring segments focusing on the previous Friday's "Tequila and Donut Day."  The show began with a recap of this infamous day, detailing E-Rock's ten-shot tequila binge, resulting in several tearful, emotionally charged outbursts.  E-Rock's obliviousness to his crying and his memorable declaration, "I retract my apology and I'll go fuck myself," were highlighted through repeated audio clips.  This segment featured Denny (or Dennis), a veteran SiriusXM personality from the decades channel, offering a composed counterpoint to E-Rock's inebriation.  Other SiriusXM staff, including Sam Roberts, Nicole and Taylor from the Cosmo channel, and various sports commentators, were also mentioned as participants in the tequila-fueled festivities.  Ron and Fez were also referenced as E-Rock appeared on their show after the Opie and Anthony broadcast.

The show then transitioned into listener-submitted audio clips from "Tequila and Donut Day," showcasing E-Rock's "confident" yet intoxicated state.  A promotional segment for a previous Donald Sutherland interview was played. The hosts then shared their negative experiences at the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade, criticizing the excessive drinking and heavy police presence.

Next, the conversation shifted to Lil Wayne's near-fatal health scare from codeine abuse (Sizzurp), followed by a contentious discussion of the Steubenville rape case, including the convicts' remorse and Candy Crowley's CNN coverage, which the hosts heavily criticized using highly offensive language. The role of social media and Anonymous in bringing the case to light was also discussed.  James Lipton was announced as a later guest.  More "Tequila and Donut Day" clips and discussion about a potential job swap between staff members Johnny Tubesticks and Sal concluded this segment.

A subsequent segment started with humorous clips from an intern, David, conducting brutally honest performance reviews.  This segued into a discussion featuring in-studio guest Dennis Falcone, detailing his meticulous radio show preparation, cross-promotion strategies, and anecdotes from his long career.  Falcone discussed his side hustle as a DJ, including children's parties, and his approach to maintaining energy.  The conversation covered radio broadcasting techniques, including jingles, on-air etiquette, and the amusing challenge of professionally introducing songs like Mercyful Fate's "Evil."

The show continued with a discussion about a staff member's "slovenly" attire, contrasted with legendary DJ William B. Williams.  Irene Cara's birthday prompted playing one of her songs (incorrectly, at first), leading to further comments.  Dennis Falcone received his sign-off, with more playful ribbing.  *Dancing with the Stars*, movie box office numbers (*Oz the Great and Powerful* and *The Incredible Burt Wonderstone*), a viral weatherman mishap, March Madness brackets, and a news report about an air-powered car were briefly discussed.  The hosts also touched on the "Mid-Atlantic" accent and actor Clarence Williams III.

Pre-recorded segments featuring James Norton as Ray J Johnson Jr. and a "Primetime Sam Roberts" parody interview with Elton John preceded a lengthy interview with James Lipton.  This interview covered Lipton's career, interview techniques, anecdotes about Marlon Brando, and a previously undisclosed personal story from his youth in France.

The final segment included a Sudoku puzzle giveaway, a caller's anecdote about James Lipton's alleged past (with the hosts' use of offensive racial slurs), further discussion of Lil Wayne's hospitalization, and yet another extensive recap of "Tequila and Donut Day," focusing on E-Rock's alcohol-fueled antics and his wife's reaction.  Who Kid, a mobile DJ, joined the studio, discussing his work, experiences, and challenges, sharing anecdotes with significant vulgarity.  Denny also participated in this DJ-centric conversation, offering contrasting perspectives.  The segment concluded with continued use of offensive language by the hosts and guests.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  This is so cool. 
[00:03:30]  This is fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy, the next minute you're acting like a  big giant ass.  He's got a try to find.  Oh my God.  It's fucking brilliant, man.  It's fucking brilliant, man.  It's fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rape.  Yeah, it's amazing.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  I've got enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:00]  Let's do it.  Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  The obç´„ time rate, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  All weekend I was singing, all the Pope's got a pointy white hat.  That was my weekend fucking cross to bear.  Mars isn't here, is he? 
[00:04:30]  What about Mercury and Venus?  Mars, the mics sound all fucked up today.  Do they?  Yeah.  Let me see.  They're a little bass here.  What's going on, man?  I don't know.  It's always something.  You know what I think?  What?  I think Eastside Dave McDonald toys around with things.  You think he fiddles?  Fiddles about?  Yeah.  In a drunken stupor.  Does he do his show drunk?  I don't know.  Seems like he is.  James. 
[00:05:00]  Hello.  Ah.  That was Toledo.  Yeah.  He really exists.  Oh, my God.  Ah, Jesus.  Really?  Yeah.  Good shows?  Okay shows.  Saturday was great.  Friday was okay.  Thursday was okay.  Not terrible, but just, you know.  I understand why Ohio is a swing state.  It's a weird place.  Yeah, like, it's not sold out shows, except for the early show Saturday at all.  Not, like, the people on Friday, late show, like, I literally felt like, wow, if I wasn't 
[00:05:30]  doing this for over 20 years, I'd be bombing right now.  Wow.  But I, it was like one of those things where, and not that they were a terrible crowd.  Yeah.  I was just, I had to work, and I'm like, on stage I thought that to myself, it's only  because you've been doing this for so fucking long that you know how to make it happen.  Make it happen.  Yeah, and into a decent set where people go, oh, that was fun.  If you were a novice at it, there would have been one little bead of sweat running right  down your temple, and everyone would have seen it. 
[00:06:00]  And six months ago I would have bombed.  Wow, the worst set I've had, and it wasn't even, you know, like, people who watched it  said, well, we enjoyed it, but it's the worst feeling I've had on stage since last April  when I was warming up for Please Be Offended in Cincinnati, another odd Ohio market.  But, oh, all right, they're not assholes, they're just, they're just a different, they  have a different mindset in that part of Ohio?  I don't know, man, not a tremendous amount of Norton fans, like, the people that showed 
[00:06:30]  up were good, but a lot of just regular comedy club people, and I opened up with a fairly  vulgar, brutal joke, so I think for regular, I'm like, oh, God, this is what it would be  like if I wasn't talking to ONA fans all the time.  Wow.  Thank God for this fucking fence.  Holy shit, I would have to be a dead man without them.  Better start kissing their asses.  Oh, God.  Cleveland, Columbus, we are gods.  Yeah.  Cincinnati, Toledo.  Not, not God's status.  No, not so much. 
[00:07:00]  No, but I kept thinking, like, that's why this is a swing state, because it's an unpredictable  place.  The mentality is different in different places.  Wow, right.  It's not predictable.  Like, Boston's Boston.  You know, you go to anyone's message, it's those guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, fuck, man.  Strange.  Oh, man.  But the people that came were really nice, and the club was great.  It wasn't like, there's no one to blame, no one fucked up, the press I did was fun,  there was no one shitty.  It was just, I just didn't feel a vibe there for me.  Wow.  At all.  It'll happen, right?  I don't know, man.  I don't know, man. 
[00:07:30]  We gotta go right to E-Rock, man.  I mean, we haven't talked to E-Rock since the big Friday show that everyone's talking  about.  We should just be able to coast for the whole week, just on Friday's show.  I heard about that one.  We coasted on Friday's show.  We just sat here and watched.  Fantastic.  The fuck did we do?  We watched E-Rock get shit-faced, and we had Denny from down the hall, an old school  radio guy.  God, he had some fucking great lines.  We should put all his lines together.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I don't want to touch a hot mic. 
[00:08:00]  Hot mic.  Is this mic hot?  Because I don't touch hot mics.  I don't want to touch.  He didn't want to touch the mic.  Why?  It was like, yeah, bring the mic.  I don't want to touch a hot mic.  Because a professional broadcaster wouldn't make that sound on a hot mic.  What does Denny do?  He, I don't know.  I don't know.  A little bit of everything.  We hung with him for four hours, and he's pretty much, I don't know.  He does the 60s, 70s channel.  Yeah, yeah.  The decades channel.  He's got a pretty good personality. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  He does the 60s, the 70s, and then he does a little Cousin Brucey.  But, you know, but he's very traditional.  Extremely traditional.  So funny.  We would try to call him in, and he's like, I don't like coming into a studio when the  on-air light is on.  On-air light's on.  When the on-air light is on.  I don't like to hear it.  Yeah.  And then we had him talking up songs, and he's hitting the post and just, you know,  doing great weather breaks.  Did he do it professionally?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Denny is a professional.  Is he in yet?  Because we've got to get an update from him as well. 
[00:09:00]  But the first time I talked to E-Rock since the Friday show was just a mere half hour  ago.  E-Rock, so walk us through it.  What happened after the big Friday show?  For the people that didn't listen, E-Rock decided to make Friday Tequila and Donut Day.  Tequila and Donut Day.  Or Donuts Day.  And he ended up having 10 shots of tequila.  10.  Mm-hmm.  10 shots of tequila.  How many did you have before you started to really feel like you might say something? 
[00:09:30]  Uh, two.  Two.  He was babbling and crying.  No, you cried?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, cunt.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Slow down a little bit.  Oh, it was crazy.  He was crying.  He was bawling.  And we go to him, E-Rock, why are you crying?  He goes, I'm not crying.  He had no idea he was crying.  I didn't know he was crying.  It was so weird.  It was fantastic.  It was one of the creepiest things.  I swear we've seen a lot on this show, but I'll say it again. 
[00:10:00]  It's one of the creepiest things I've ever seen.  He's bawling.  Tears are flowing down his face.  We go, E-Rock, what's wrong?  Why are you crying?  His lip is all quibbery.  And he goes, I'm not crying.  I'm not.  I didn't even know what to say to that because he swore that he wasn't crying.  And then he stopped crying.  And then out of nowhere, he was talking about the show and everything.  And then he thought he ruined the show.  And he goes, this one's supposed to be like that.  And it was so fucking bad.  Not only did he not ruin the show, people say one of the best shows we've done in a really long time. 
[00:10:30]  I heard it ever.  I heard it was one of the best shows ever.  Yes.  It wasn't ever.  What was the crying thing about?  Honestly, I still don't know.  It was great.  I don't know because it wasn't a bawling, whining, it wasn't that.  I was talking.  I just happened to be.  But your voice was a little off as far as crying.  And your lower lip was quivering.  What do you remember about Friday?  I remember most of it. 
[00:11:00]  And what I didn't, the listeners were kind enough to text it to me all weekend.  I'm sure they did.  They said you had the line of the century.  How did the line of the century go again?  It was like, um, uh, I don't know.  Is it the apology one?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  I want to retract.  I retract my apology and I'll go fuck myself.  And go fuck myself.  Yes.  I'll retract my apology and go fuck myself.  Fucking classic.  It was great.  So what do you remember?  Talk. 
[00:11:30]  Um, it got really difficult during, uh, the after show, which I think you guys predicted  that.  We were so mad.  We knew it all kick in right at 10 o'clock.  Although the last hour was pretty damn fucking good.  Yeah.  Um, I kicked in pretty good before 10, but.  I remember doing Sam's show and then realizing that it was like 10 50 and we were done.  I was, and I thought I just sat down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I go into the back and then all of a sudden I'm getting, Hey, Ron and Fez want  to talk to you.  Ronnie.  Ronnie. 
[00:12:00]  So I came back down here, um, took a walk, did the weekend stuff, took another walk.  You were, you were at, you were able to work after that.  Yeah, I did, uh, I did all the weekend.  You had some pizza too, right?  How the fuck is that possible?  Didn't Roland get you some pizza?  Yeah.  I had a piece of pizza.  At three o'clock.  Yeah.  Fuck this shit.  I'm going to go talk to Scott.  Oh, would that have been great?  Wait, but you're fast forwarding a little bit.  I want to know more about the in show. 
[00:12:30]  Ah, the in show.  Okay.  Um, I'm trying to find specific.  I mean, I just, I remember I was just standing there the entire time.  Well, not really.  Well, no, not really.  When I was talking, I was right.  You were wandering around a lot.  Oh, I was running to the bathroom a lot.  And you were trying to find people to do shots with you.  And you certainly.  Yeah, I was doing that.  Jimmy, we thought it was going to be a boss.  He shows up with two bottles of tequila.  We're like, no one's drinking tequila this early.  And of course he did a couple of shots.  And then we're like, well, find other people to do shots with. 
[00:13:00]  Like I didn't do any.  I didn't do any.  And they found him.  Yeah.  A lot of people.  But he ended up fucking killing the bottle, man.  He found people to do tequila.  I'm going to guess.  A lot of people.  I'm going to guess Nicole.  I'm going to guess Troy.  No.  Nicole said no.  Troy wasn't here.  Troy wasn't here other than in.  Yeah.  So those are two guarantees that actually weren't partaking in tequila and donut day.  A lot of sports guys from around here did.  Uh, yeah.  Dennis did.  Dennis, the one guy you would think would never do tequila, ended up doing three or four shots.  Yeah.  That's great. 
[00:13:30]  Taylor from Cosmo.  Yep.  She came by.  She did two.  Some other people.  So yeah, guys from like the NFL channel.  Right.  Oh, right, right.  Stinky came in.  Oh, of course he did.  Good for him.  Good for him.  Yeah.  Nothing has changed in fucking 13 years.  It was great.  Drunk he is.  And then, um, and then of course.  Oh, Rich from the mashup.  Yeah.  Rich.  He didn't do a shot.  He did.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because Nicole wouldn't.  So he did it for.  Yeah, and Roland allegedly did a shot. 
[00:14:00]  He had a different bottle of tequila.  It was the, um.  All right.  That's something I want to, I want to address too.  It was the, uh, the George Clooney tequila.  Why don't we have clips from Friday's show?  Yeah, probably shouldn't.  There's a few highlights.  Do we not have clips from Friday's show?  We should have, we should have the, the line of the century, whatever people call it.  And then we certainly should have the exchange between you and Anthony.  That was a good one.  And we certainly should have Roland doing his shot.  I don't, I don't know why we don't have a bunch of clips from Friday's show. 
[00:14:30]  If everyone's talking about Friday's show, we should have a few highlight clips.  Wait, do we not have clips from Friday's show?  We should.  Jesus.  I've been, I swear to God, I've been fucking looking forward to hearing clips from this  dumb show.  I know, right?  Especially because Jimmy didn't even, he wasn't even here for the show.  We needed clips.  I got my Twitter blew up.  People were like, if he would tell me at this show, fucking today was classic.  I wish he was fucking, he was a rock star.  Yeah.  Right.  Amazing.  All right.  Travis is working on some clips, so we'll have him a little, maybe a little later this 
[00:15:00]  hour.  The, uh, so there's a bottle of tequila.  There was the Patron, which Iraq was drinking.  And then there was this George Clooney tequila that Roland had.  And Roland came in with it and poured himself a shot.  And all he was doing was trying to promote the tequila.  Yeah.  He swigged it down.  And a couple of other people took some shots off of the George Clooney bottle.  Why is the George Clooney bottle?  He has his own brand of tequila.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He got his tequila.  So then Iraq is hammered at this point.  He's always done 10 shots of Patron.  The Patron was out.  So it was like, drink some of this.  So he takes some, he fucking swigs it down. 
[00:15:30]  He makes a face.  He's like, smooth.  That is smooth.  Smooth.  Yeah.  You're right.  Oh, I'll let you finish.  Sorry.  So, so, so, so there was a little over half a bottle of the George Clooney tequila left.  So I grab it and I'm like, I'm like, you know, fuck man, it's early in the morning  and shit, but Iraq's been doing, I'm going to fucking, I'm going to do a shot at least.  So I fucking tip the bottle and I'm just sitting here going, and it's just going down,  down, down, finally squeak out the last bit of it. 
[00:16:00]  Bottles fucking empty.  You chugged tequila?  Well, apparently.  You would think.  Apparently.  That's what Iraq thought.  Uh, yeah, and Iraq is looking at me like I'm a god.  He called you awesome.  And he started again, kind of, he goes, you know, I, look, I know you don't like me.  And he starts crying.  But it wasn't the, um, it wasn't the, the, uh, the bawling.  No, no.  It just was happening.  It was just tears again. 
[00:16:30]  And he goes, uh, but I got to tell you something.  That was awesome.  And he gives me the fist.  And they pound it out.  I shook my hand, but you were doing a lot of fist bumping, you rock.  Now.  Yeah.  That bottle of tequila.  Yeah.  Okay.  Couple things.  One, when I took it and I know I did the smooth, I said the smooth thing, I started to realize  this was kind of weak.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did not dawn on me to what had happened until the show was over.  You had your backpack and you're like, see you later.  Have a good weekend. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm like, he's going home.  That was not tequila.  Yeah.  Oh, you, you knew before.  I didn't then, but I knew when I saw Ant, when he said goodbye to me and he started walking  with his backpack.  I was fine.  That wasn't tequila.  I knew it was water before it even came in.  But I didn't know at that point.  But I did three shots from that bottle thinking he was still doing tequila.  So the official count was 10, even though on the scoreboard, I think we had up to 13.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Three fakies.  10 real shots.  And over the weekend, also, I was getting tweets from people that honestly thought I chugged 
[00:17:30]  a half a bottle of tequila.  Nice.  And, you know, I would do that at nine in the morning and drive back to Long Island after  chugging half a bottle of tequila.  Yeah.  And so then what happened after you left here?  You were able to do all your programming.  Yeah, I did everything.  Let's see how it came out, though.  You have to hear the fucking complaints.  I think it was the first weekend we didn't have any complaints.  Wow.  Maybe you should drink tequila every Friday.  Yeah, I was focused. 
[00:18:00]  Wait, I don't, I don't, I just, where do you get the tolerance from?  You don't drink that much.  Tolerance?  He was fucking blasted.  But to have 10 shots of tequila, I would be a fucking mess for a couple straight days.  I wouldn't be able to.  A couple straight days, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't be able to function after that.  There's no fucking way.  You were so sloppy drunk, man.  I was doing.  You're slowing down.  Anytime I had left, I had gone to the bathroom or I was downing bottles of water.  You sounded much better on, toward the end of the after show, and then on Ron and Fez, 
[00:18:30]  you sounded a lot better.  But still.  On this show, you reached the point where you couldn't even fucking talk.  It was great.  But you shouldn't have been better by the Ron and Fez show.  You do 10 shots.  That's what I don't understand, because you didn't really eat a lot.  You're drinking a lot of water.  It's so early in the morning, you're not, you know, putting food in you.  And he was moving around a lot, too.  So you got 10 shots on a mostly empty stomach.  Holy fuck.  Donuts.  We got three clips out.  Yeah.  The first one would be when Ant was slamming down the bottle. 
[00:19:00]  Why would that be the first one we play?  We were just recently talking about it.  What other ones you got?  Travis is working on ones in the back.  Another one is where Eric has a donut in his mouth, and he's crying.  The other one is Sam asks him, who do you think treats you the worst around here?  And Eric gives his response.  So which one would you guys like?  Oh, I got to hear donut crying.  Oh, yeah.  Donut crying.  Sounds terrific.  Yeah, they're all terrific.  Yeah, play the donut crying one. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, I'm guilty.  He's crying.  Why?  I don't understand this.  Why are you crying?  Eric, you're emotional right now for some reason.  Why?  Did the tequila just tap into like a region of your head?  I don't even know that I'm crying.  I am fucking baffled here.  Holy shit.  I have seen some shit with this radio show.  What the fuck?  You don't know you're crying? 
[00:20:00]  You got tears pouring down your mouth?  Nope.  Oh, wow, man.  Rich Voss, where are you going to be?  Isn't that amazing?  Goddamn, E-Rock.  You can hear that you're crying there, right?  This is the first I'm hearing any of this since being here.  I couldn't listen to the replays.  Yeah.  And I could tell when everyone got to certain parts of the replays just by the way my Twitter 
[00:20:30]  was blowing up.  And then over the weekend from On Demand when people were listening to it, it just didn't  stop.  You could tell what part of the show they were hearing.  Were you embarrassed?  No, I'm not embarrassed.  It's difficult to listen to, but I'm not embarrassed about it.  I've probably done other things that I've been embarrassed about more.  On the show?  Than this?  Sure, or in life.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but not in front of so many people.  Yeah, well.  Wow.  It's hard to hear yourself recorded when you're drunk. 
[00:21:00]  Just, you know, let me listen to any afternoon drive show I've ever done.  Yeah, you know you were there, but it's like, I don't remember sounding quite like that.  Whoa.  That's just amazing.  What clip next there?  We could play where Sam asks.  Yeah, do the Sam one next.  Who do you think treats you the worst?  That would be you.  You think so?  Yeah.  Why is that?  Because you're an asshole.  Oh, yeah.  Why do you think that? 
[00:21:30]  Because it deflects all attention off of you, but lays positive attention on you.  I see.  If that makes any sense.  I see.  It doesn't.  I don't think it does.  I don't think so either.  So I'm the biggest.  That's great.  Yeah, that actually made sense, Eroch.  It lays more positive attention on you.  That would be you.  And then we have the tequila, I guess, when I was chugging the alleged tequila. 
[00:22:00]  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen anything like this.  He's finished a bottle.  Anthony just did a half a bottle of tequila.  Incredible.  Amazing.  And I know, I know that he doesn't like me, but.  This is like Jimmy.  But what?  That was awesome.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Eroch, my friend, and I do like you a lot.  You're crazy.  You're crazy.  You're crying again.  You know that, right?  Now I know.  What he just did?  Yeah.  Awesome.  It's fucking beautiful.  Fucking beautiful.  And you can isolate that.  And take a photo.  I will. 
[00:23:00]  Wow.  You're a blubbering fool.  Right.  It was unbelievable.  It really was.  People are like, you guys got to do that every Friday.  You can't do those type of shows every Friday.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  It just wouldn't.  Break that out every once in a while, certainly.  But.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just.  The whole part of not knowing you're crying, I thought about all weekend.  Oh.  That is just weird to me.  Yeah.  That was strange.  And people have asked, and I don't have an answer.  Dude.  Tears were pouring out of your eyes. 
[00:23:30]  You would feel it physically.  Like, oh, shit, man.  I got tears all over my face.  But it wasn't your typical crying where, yeah, it was.  It was a typical cry.  You were, like Anne said, your lip was quivering.  Oh, it was great.  You were in cry mode.  All right.  Then it didn't feel like that at that point.  It looked exactly like that.  And you were very red.  Like, I'm looking at you now, and you know, you're normal and stuff.  You were so red, like, just boozed up red.  I was very hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I give off a lot of heat.  A lot of heat.  That was unbelievable. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, boy.  We certainly will have more clips.  I want to hear some Denny clips, too.  Yeah.  He was fantastic.  I don't know if it'll play as well as it did live.  Who knows?  I just loved the radio voice.  Everything he was saying.  Well, the contrast between these two as well.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You're a babbling, blithering drunk, and he's trying to hold this level of radio professionalism  while all this shit was going on.  It was great.  Through the madness. 
[00:24:30]  Towards the end, I said some not nice things to Dennis.  Oh, you were saying not nice things to pretty much everybody.  No, but around here is one thing.  He's, I guess, no, a guest.  And I think I kept pointing out how many times he's been fired.  Oh, you think, you kept saying it.  But there was nothing that bad.  No, it wasn't that bad.  There was nothing you can't come back from.  Sal took the brunt of your drunken anguish.  Why, Sal?  Well, Sal just thought the whole bit was ridiculous.  Sal thought the bit was crazy. 
[00:25:00]  Sal wouldn't participate.  He wouldn't do a shot.  Sal, you thought it was ridiculous, right?  And it backfired on Sal.  Sal was trying to be the professional, not drinking, and making fun of E-Rock for drinking  on the air and coming up with the bit in the first place.  And then meanwhile, all the Twitter comments, E-Rock's a rock star, Sal's a faggot.  That's pretty much what the consensus was.  It backfired on you, didn't it?  It's nothing against Eric for drinking.  I like to drink.  It's just I wanted Eric to do whatever he wanted to do. 
[00:25:30]  Let him, per se, dig his own hole.  Let him shine.  Yeah, let him do his own hole.  Please.  Yeah, let him say whatever he wants to say.  I wanted nothing to do.  He dug his own hole and then threw you in it.  Yeah, that's fine.  He did well.  I just didn't want to drink that day.  Let Eric be the point of attention.  That was great.  E-Rock has done so much shit for this radio show.  It's unbelievable.  Which he pointed out as he was crying.  He was running down the list.  Everything he had done for this program.  It was great.  It was fantastic. 
[00:26:00]  And then I like when he just stopped and said, this wasn't supposed to be how the show went.  And after it was so obvious it was an amazing show to everybody, and then he turns around thinking he bombed.  Thinking he ruined the show.  And ruined the show, and he started crying again.  And the actual thing is it's every other day you should feel that way.  Eric's the best.  That was great.  No one wanted to make eye contact with him because he was just like doing this.  He was going back and forth trying to pin his eyes on someone. 
[00:26:30]  And then give him a talking to.  Oh, yes.  His wrath.  He's a very emotional guy, that's all.  Eric's a very sensitive guy.  Yeah.  So you put in a full day's work?  Yeah, because after this show I did Sam's show.  Yep.  Ron and Fez a little bit.  Walked around for a little bit, and then Ron and Fez wanted to talk to me, so I came in.  And finished the stuff for the weekend.  Walked around the city for a while.  I got something to eat, and then went home.  How'd you get home? 
[00:27:00]  I got home.  It was all good.  Oh, no.  He drove.  Oh, boy.  I got home.  That's never good.  Ooh, a little behind the wheel action.  I didn't say that.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  How many hours later did you go home?  Yeah, what time did you go home?  I got home 3.15, 3.30.  Ooh, that's not true.  That was only about, what, five hours later.  And then what happened?  You just crashed?  I, yeah, well, I passed out, and then I woke up and saw the clock was like 6.40, and started 
[00:27:30]  freaking out because it's that time of the year where the morning looks exactly like the  afternoon.  You thought you were late for work?  I hate that, yeah.  I jumped up, started panicking, and I'm like fumbling, trying to get my phone, and was reading  my phone and thinking you guys were trying to call for the last hour or something, right?  And then I'm looking, and I see Twitter going through, and then I realize, oh, I went to  work today. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And I'm going to go way back down.  It really is great when that happens, because I've had that happen.  You wake up, you really think you've got to get to work, and you're like, oh, wait, I  already did that today.  I'm going to sleep.  You know, you'd think after so many years that it would kind of go away, and it never  does.  Now you panic.  Did you get sick?  No, actually, I didn't.  That amazes me.  I didn't throw up, and I was expecting a bad headache or something, and I didn't even  have that, but Roland tells me this after anything, and I never believe it, but this 
[00:28:30]  time it actually happened.  Roland tells me, and he goes, oh, tequila shits are the worst, but he says that after  barbecue and Guinness and any of that stuff, right?  He says it after everything, yeah.  But yeah, it was nonstop for, I think, three or four hours.  It was just constantly going.  Dutying?  Oh, yeah.  Just pouring out of you?  Just, there was nothing solid at all.  It was, it's like, you know when you took a garden hose and turned it, instead of the  stream, it just goes on that faint spray? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God.  God damn it.  You're just spraying out of your asshole.  So, yeah, for like four hours and a bottle of Pepto and finally calm down.  I should have Denny say that, spraying out of your asshole.  Here's the tokens.  Here's the tokens, yes.  Make sure Denny stops in after, when he arrives today.  Sal found a kind of a long clip about how you think you ruined the show after it was  obvious to everyone we had an amazing show.  Let's hear that.  Yeah.  Before you do that, to Anthony and Toby. 
[00:29:30]  Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I fucked this whole show up.  What?  Eric.  He's crying.  What do you got for me, Sal?  Hold on.  Hold on, Dennis.  Jesus, Danny.  You don't know good radio when it's right in front of your face.  You're stepping on a bit.  E-Rock, what are you talking about?  What do you mean?  You fucked it up.  This is not what it was supposed to be.  What was it supposed to be?  What was it supposed to be?  What was it supposed to be?  It turned out. 
[00:30:00]  Look at Rich.  Rich, do you miss partying?  Not at all, right?  What are you talking about, E-Rock?  Eric.  It was perfect.  This show was good.  Why are you crying and saying you messed it up?  What I fucking love about E-Rock, this is where he got honest and fucking got even with  this fucking jamoke right here.  E-Rock.  Okay, and I like that.  What was the show supposed to be?  What was the show supposed to be?  Not this.  What were you thinking it was going to be? 
[00:30:30]  You know what?  Fuck it.  You're welcome for four hours.  Wait, what?  But why do you think the show sucked?  Or that you ruined the show?  A drinking show?  Yeah, but look.  The donuts are gone.  The tequila's gone.  What kind of show did you want today?  You know what?  You're right.  You had nothing planned.  What happened?  What happened?  You're confusing everybody.  Yeah, because you came up with a tequila and donut show, but now you're saying that you're 
[00:31:00]  sorry you ruined the show.  What makes you think you ruined the show?  I don't think people really wanted to hear this.  But now that I'm thinking about it, and I've worked in radio for 19 years, yeah, they wanted  to hear this.  So I retract my apology and go fuck myself.  I retract my apology and go fuck myself. 
[00:31:30]  It's about 30 seconds more if you want to hear the rest.  Oh, 30 seconds more?  Yeah, let's play it out.  Jesus Christ.  This was awesome.  Oh, God.  You sure?  You sure was awesome.  And?  Yeah, we went late.  I see that.  Yes.  It's past 10.  He's running the gamut of emotions.  10-08.  Yeah, yeah.  Bonus time.  Bonus time.  Do we get bonus money, though?  Denny?  Well, you're stepping into somebody else's day party. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, Sam's show, which...  It's stepping into somebody else's day party.  Well, midday.  Are midday's that important in radio, Denny?  Well, sure.  It's the at work listening.  Yeah.  Because people leave the radio on, you get all those quarter hours.  All those quarter hours.  All those quarter hours.  Do you know, there's something to be said for guys.  One of the shows I did on the road this weekend was a guy who did the show by himself. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And he was doing radio for 30 years.  And he was one of these guys who was just a fucking pro.  Yeah, yeah.  And he didn't fake laugh, but he was very conversational and engaging.  And when I walked out of there, I'm like, God damn, that guy was a fucking pro.  Professional, right?  Like, he was so much fun.  Like, you don't run into those old school guys anymore.  There's something really, really great about it.  Most of them are gone.  The ones that aren't cheesy.  Like, this guy wasn't cheesy.  Yeah, it is an actual talent.  And it's one of those things that, like, just are gone.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  So then, so Friday was a waste for you?  You didn't really do anything Friday night?  No.  You were done.  There was nothing I could do.  I was just, I was running to the bathroom.  I was, you know.  Shitting?  Yeah.  Doing Pepto-Bismol.  And just trying to let it work itself out.  Man.  When did you start feeling all right?  Like, after I woke up, like, I, like, around seven, yeah, 647, around there, I started  feeling better.  I, I felt achy, but I wasn't, like, my head wasn't fucked up. 
[00:33:30]  I didn't have a headache.  I didn't feel nauseous.  I just don't understand that.  I'd have had to wait until Saturday morning.  It would have happened a lot.  And been like, all right, I think I'm okay.  Yeah, it would have been well into Saturday for me.  I'm a fucking lightweight.  Jeez.  And then Saturday, you felt pretty, pretty well.  Saturday, I got up at 10 o'clock and did stuff around the house.  And how, uh, how did the wife take the whole thing?  She, she was laughing at it.  She thought it was good.  She thought it was cool.  Yeah.  She understood. 
[00:34:00]  She's a cool broad.  Yeah.  She understood.  The Mrs. E-Rock is a cool broad.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, what other clips you got, Sal?  Anything else?  Uh, we got Eric doing his first and second water shot.  And we got another long clip of, uh, E-Rock and Denny going back and forth.  Oh, nice.  Okay.  Uh, so Jimmy, then we, uh, switched, uh, did the switcheroo.  So now he's drinking water, but he absolutely did 10 shots of tequila.  And he absolutely didn't know that this was water.  No, he had no idea.  Yeah, listen to this.  All right.  Here we go.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:34:30]  Cheers.  Salud.  Salud.  You drinking?  Oh, God.  Oh, that's smooth.  Yeah.  Oh, that's smooth.  Can I hear that one more time, please?  Oh.  Please, I want to hear you, Fox.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  Wait, wait, wait.  Cheers.  Salud.  Salud.  You drinking?  Oh, God. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, that's smooth.  Yeah.  Water.  Fucking water.  Oh, that's smooth.  Oh, you're right.  But he made a face before he said that also.  Like, he was expecting it to be rough.  So he made a face like it was rough.  Like, uh-uh.  And then he realized, oh, ooh, that's smooth.  Okay.  Yeah, that's when I started.  It was like, this doesn't, it wasn't his.  Yeah, yeah.  He didn't have the kick the other one did.  You absolutely didn't realize, though, until after the fact.  No, not until Ant was leaving.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  What else you got there, Sal?  Uh, we got another one of Eric doing another water shot.  Sure.  Hit that.  Oh, it's pouring it on the carpet for the homies.  E-Rock, do a shot with the guy.  Come on.  It's your promotion.  It did enough.  It did enough.  It's up to 11.  Maybe he needs a breather.  But that's smooth.  Oh, it is.  Is it?  Yes.  The last one was really smooth, huh?  Going down.  Is it smooth?  That's water.  What?  The other guy. 
[00:36:00]  Who?  What?  The only guy that just blows the bit.  No, some guy we brought in.  Some guy, and he took a swig of the tequila.  Maybe we should have told him.  Probably should have.  He goes, oh, that's water.  But he didn't blow it, because E-Rock didn't.  Yeah, E-Rock still didn't know.  Oh, yeah.  Even though right in front of his face, the guy said it was water.  Yeah.  Oh, but E-Rock didn't think so.  He used to know it was smooth.  Smooth.  That's smooth.  Oh.  And then we got a clip of E-Rock and Denny going.  Is it Denny or Dennis? 
[00:36:30]  Dennis.  It is Dennis.  Yeah, his name is Dennis, but everyone's calling him Denny.  I've been calling him Denny there Friday, so.  Fair enough.  So here's E-Rock and Denny going back and forth.  Old school radio guy, and E-Rock just fucking hammered.  You're drinking half a bottle of tequila.  I try to find things that we've done during the week and maybe reapply it to the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Denny?  Hey, is this mic hot?  I don't want to touch it until it's on.  No one cares.  You did three hours.  Is this mic hot? 
[00:37:00]  I don't want to touch it until it's on.  It's all.  If it's on.  That is so.  Who cares?  Every little aspect of radio professionalism, he knows it.  Who cares if it's hot?  Well, it's just, you know, like.  You don't move a hot mic.  No, you don't.  It makes sounds.  You don't move a hot mic.  No, no.  You don't want to make those sounds because then the listener's saying, hey, what's that?  It just distracts from the listening experience.  It doesn't.  Listening experience.  You've got to learn these things.  How's this guy feeling over here?  We're constantly.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  He's crying, but he doesn't know he's crying.  We've got to get a listener to take him home. 
[00:37:30]  You should get yourself an Obey and Anthony prize pack.  You should probably tell Denny how you're feeling.  Denny did great.  The first three hours, he did great.  He's not needed now.  He's not needed now.  He was.  He just told me he's not needed now.  Who's the star now, Irak?  Irak loves telling people they're not needed any longer.  No kidding.  It's 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  We're in overtime.  This guy's got to hit the network news or something at the time of the hour.  Shut up.  Turn it off.  Shut up.  Who's the star right now, Eric?  The network news. 
[00:38:00]  Turn it off.  Don't laugh at me.  Turn it off.  Don't laugh at me.  Turn it off.  And try the back time.  If you have two minutes, give me a save.  I'm Maurice Williams.  It's a minute and 36.  All right.  It's the Denny show.  This is one of the best Fridays ever.  Holy shit.  Fucking weird.  You guys have like a regular sign off like I was on, now I'm gone or anything like that?  I was on, now I'm gone.  All right.  Let's do something.  Next time we get together, I'll bring the coffee. 
[00:38:30]  No need for the sugar because you, you're sweet enough.  Let's pretend it's your last show because you've been fired many times.  You don't get to do a last show.  E-Rock is a belligerent drop show.  Buddy goes, you don't get to do a last show, which is another radio thing.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know that's true, E-Rock.  To quote the great rich boss, Pingo.  You don't get to do a last show when you were fired from Terrestrial.  Right.  Do your final soft, sorry, do your final sign off when like say maybe CBS Infinity. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, how about Firefall?  Oh, he's still talking.  Goodbye, I love you.  He's still talking.  You're trying to create something here and you're walking all over it.  Well, because I'm used to talking with the music under me.  I can't take this.  Yeah, no one cares.  Hey, we got to get out of here.  No one cares.  He tries Firefall.  No one cares.  He's got a song for everything.  Wait, let's do this.  Give me a topic.  E-Rock, throw out a topic and see if Denny has a song real fast.  No.  A topic, please. 
[00:39:30]  Please, please, please, please.  That's it.  Yeah, we got some more.  We have Denny doing some intros to some music hitting the post, I think.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Whatever one you guys would like.  What do you want to do?  Denny hitting the post on working for the weekend.  That was a good one.  Let's hear what that sounded like.  Yeah, okay.  Why not?  How about, I know, working for the weekend. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, lover boy.  Go ahead, give it to me.  Here we go.  This is your weekend party song right here.  It's like Jerry's gin joint.  Oh, what is this?  The live version?  The live version?  The live version.  Oh, Sal.  Again.  Holy shit.  Handsome Johnny.  Tube steaks wouldn't do that.  All right.  It's time.  It's a five o'clock whistle.  We're getting out of the office.  You've been there all week working up a sweat, but now it's time to work on a boogie on the  dance floor.  Lover boy, come on in here and show us how to rock and roll because you and I, baby, we're 
[00:40:30]  working for the weekend.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Love it.  The Chrysler Building Video is up on Opie Radio on YouTube.  It's on the Facebook.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  And then Iraq just was plugging everybody's gigs.  Every little dump thing we're all doing.  He obviously didn't mention Toledo.  Oh, oh. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Anything else, Iraq?  You don't feel ashamed or anything, do you?  No, I guess some of my family's starting to hear this for the first time now.  What?  Really?  Yeah, my brother just texted me.  Oh.  He goes, you're a mess.  Oh.  But he said, this is awesome.  You know, he's like Billy Bivitt in Cuckoo's Nest after he had sex.  Yeah.  And this is Nurse Ratched saying, aren't you ashamed?  And Iraq's going, without stuttering, no, I'm not.  Right.  No, I'm not.  And our job is to get him back to shame.  Right.  And punch his penis as he's dragged away.  So he cuts his own throat in the office. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hitting Voss' laugh was very funny, too.  Oh, yeah.  It was unbelievable.  Voss' hysterical laugh.  Iraq shouldn't be ashamed at all.  That was amazing.  Shame.  What a performance.  If you do that every fucking Friday, then yeah, of course.  Yeah, fucking voted.  Voted.  Man.  That was a hell of a...  Any other clips coming in, or is that about it?  Yeah, we got a little more of Iraq and Denny going back and forth.  That's a long clip.  And we also have Denny hitting the post on it.  I like the Iraq and Denny going back and forth, because there's such a contrast there. 
[00:42:00]  Even though Denny did three shots of tequila, he kept it like, fuck that.  I still got to be a radio professional.  Let's listen to this.  You know the ramp time in this song, Denny?  Just give him the outfit.  Who's that, Tavares?  No, that would be the Tramps.  Oh, the Tramps, right.  Tavares did the other one from Saturday Night Fever.  More Than a Woman.  More Than a Woman.  Which is written by the Bee Gees.  Sounds like a Bee Gees song, right?  Yeah, it is Bee Gees.  Of course, yeah.  No, I mean, it sounds like they were singing. 
[00:42:30]  Well, I've had myself a blast reliving the past here on a Friday.  The Opie and Anthony show, tequila and donuts.  Don't forget Rich Voss.  He's going to be out there at Bohemia.  Make sure you go out and see him.  We're going to be out there with the Vans.  Sam's got the Wheel of Prizes.  You've got some Opie and Anthony koozies to win.  That's right.  Also got some chopsticks, too.  Bring him into the boss on Monday.  He'll get a kick out of that.  My name is Dennis Falcone.  Love so much.  Don't forget, this coming weekend here on the 60s on 6, everybody's favorite cousin, 
[00:43:00]  Cousin Bruce, you'll be here at 8 o'clock.  Make sure you join him.  You just have an instinct for that shit.  That's fucking beautiful.  That is beautiful.  I'm helping out E-Rock, though.  How did I fail?  He failed.  He failed?  That was supposed to be his final sign-off.  He was just signing off for the week.  The thing is, you don't say anything.  You never say goodbye.  He knows that.  He can't do that.  No, the radio station goes on, and you don't want to do anything bad.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:43:30]  Hope's right.  Shut up.  This was your final stand-off, and you promoted a fucking song.  He's a gentleman to the end.  He's a gentleman.  I would be fucking breaking the equipment.  A professional.  No, you're not.  They fired him.  All right.  All right.  Say you go to another market.  You say, you know what he did on his last break?  Shut up.  I'm just a music shock.  I'm not Opie and Anthony.  Those guys are zany DJs.  They could do stuff like that.  Dennis.  I'm not going to do that. 
[00:44:00]  I know.  And you're looking for your next gig.  I totally understand that.  Fuck.  Oh.  You need to say your final goodbye to the audience that made you.  No, no, no.  On the station that you're currently on.  You don't say goodbye because the station is 24-7.  You don't say goodbye because you know what happens next week at 3 p.m., 6 a.m., whenever  the fuck you're on.  Life goes on.  Some other dude, and guess what?  The audience doesn't give a shit.  And life goes on.  Exactly.  Life goes on.  Doesn't give a shit.  Life goes on.  You're not going between anger. 
[00:44:30]  Doesn't give a shit.  Crying.  Life goes on.  You say your goodbye.  And love.  And then you go off to Toledo.  Hey, look, my friend, I've been in this business for 30 years, you know?  What's going on in Toledo, Eric?  Jim Norton will be.  Yes.  I don't know the place.  Wait, Daddy just took his head.  Come on.  I mean, come on.  You rock it.  I just can't take it anymore.  I'm not insulting you.  I've got to listen to professionals like Radio War.  You're insulting me.  No, you're a veteran.  I'm not insulting you.  I have the utmost respect for you.  But this is your last show.  You should say goodbye to the audience that supported you. 
[00:45:00]  I said I had a blast.  That built you.  Nah, it built me.  Come on.  You just move on.  And then you welcome them back when you go to the next station.  See you on down the dial.  See you on down the dial?  How do you not love them?  You got them all.  But you didn't say that during your combined.  That's the perfect thing you say.  I'll see you at 1560 AM.  Any further to the right, I'll be in the glove compartment.  I made vocal music at 1390 WRIV. 
[00:45:30]  You did?  I've done that.  You've done the poker.  Done it.  I've done it at all.  Done it.  They were back live.  And you're further to the right, and I'll be in the glove compartment.  How old school is that?  Dude, that's a fucking...  You know that line's been around before?  Oh, yeah.  He's got them all.  He's got them all.  The old school where there was an actual dial that went back and forth in your car,  and that was way over to the right.  That's funny.  I'll be in your glove compartment.  Wait, I'll be in the glove compartment.  How great is that?  What do you got, Sal? 
[00:46:00]  One more you said.  Yeah.  E-Rock tells Ope to go home.  Is that a belligerent, man?  Maybe you should pure.  I don't feel sick, though.  Yeah, but you should get an ass.  I know, but you're crying.  You don't even know you're crying.  I can see this ending horribly.  You want to belly up to the garbage and stick your fingers down your throat?  Go home.  We're done.  Holy shit.  Scott and Todd end at 9.48.  And we're going to end at 9.52. 
[00:46:30]  I'm staying in this seat for a little longer.  Go home.  No one needs you.  Go home.  Go home.  No one needs you.  No one needs you.  That's so mean.  Yeah.  It just means everybody.  Yeah.  We were all scared to make eye contact with him.  E-Rock is a nasty little drunk.  And it all started with the Scott and Todd shit.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  That felt, you know, it felt a little flat, I guess, considering all the work you put into it.  What did he do?  I was watching Dish Nation, I thought of you. 
[00:47:00]  What did you do about Scott and Todd?  Just breaking down their show and the fact that they don't really talk that much and they  get paid between two and four million apiece to do.  Get the fuck out of here, really?  Yeah, exactly.  That's why he brought it to the show.  So they make a shitload of money to do pretty much nothing on their show.  Apparently they talk just a fraction over an hour every show.  That's it.  An hour out of four.  They're on the air four hours.  They talk maybe an hour.  I watched some of that horrible Dish Nation.  Thank you.  And God damn, the way they do the jokes.  Dish Nation.  It sucks. 
[00:47:30]  People are watching, man.  The Black Show isn't that bad.  Like, compared to the other shows, that one is actually okay compared to the Scott and  Todd and the other.  Oh.  Scott and Todd.  That Scott and Todd's a bummer.  It's so hard to watch on that show.  On that Dish Nation.  Yeah.  When he does the, he's just doing jokes in his sweater.  So am I, actually, right now.  But he's doing them into camera.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's playing to the camera, yeah.  Oh, yuck.  Yuck, huh?  Well, do we have that disc of Scott and Todd?  Because you, we should have, we should have that. 
[00:48:00]  Maybe we'll play that after the break.  Oh, right.  Because we never got to it Friday.  No, we never got to it.  Never played it.  And this could be good.  We can maybe play this after the break.  We'll see.  Let's do that.  Anything else, Yrock?  I like when he said there was jelly in the donut and he was all happy.  Yeah.  He's like, jelly in the donut.  He's crying with a face full of jelly donut, like private pile.  Yeah, exactly.  You absolutely held your own, man.  Well, that's good.  You really did, considering you were 10 shots in. 
[00:48:30]  Thanks for the Toledo plug.  You're very welcome.  You're a good boy.  Even though you couldn't remember where it was.  It's all right.  Yrock's a sweet boy.  Neither could anybody else in Toledo.  Yrock's a sweet boy.  And Yrock's always been a soldier, man.  Period.  I say that to everyone.  Never says no.  The amount of shit he's done for this show is ridiculous.  Oh, yeah.  Ridiculous.  Yrock is the very rare combination of utterly incompetent and irreplaceable.  Very rare. 
[00:49:00]  It's very rare that he does absolutely nothing and yet is irreplaceable on this show.  Absolutely worthless and yet loved.  We got it.  The clips keep on coming in.  We're going to have to replay that show.  It's so many people.  Next time we're out or something.  So many people were raving about it.  Yeah.  Saying that they heard the original show and then had to listen to one and some people  two replays.  Right.  Hearing it three times and they were still cracking up. 
[00:49:30]  I got to get this.  I got to get SiriusXM activated in my car.  Yeah, right.  I fucking keep forgetting.  Right.  To get our channel activated.  Did this make the countdown?  No, it didn't because I couldn't focus on that show.  Oh, boy.  To edit it down.  All right.  So it'll be fresh when we replay the whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have another clip coming in.  We're not playing the whole show, by the way.  These are clips that they're just grabbing on the fly.  I wanted to hear these.  What do you got, Sal?  This is when everything starts to blur a little bit forever.  How many shots in, you think?  Do you remember, Yrock? 
[00:50:00]  I have no idea.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll have to listen.  What's the matter, Yrock?  You all right, Bubba?  Yrock.  Woo!  How you doing?  Everything is blurring.  So I'll be here, here, and here.  Oh, you're so three of me.  Which one's the Oopster?  Yeah, the Oopster, Opie, and Greg Hughes.  So you feel okay, though?  You're in this general area.  Do you have the spins?  A little bit?  No, I don't have the spins.  But it's, like, all over. 
[00:50:30]  Holy shit, he's fucked up!  Oh, no, Yrock!  How many, uh, ants?  Your eyes are tearing.  How many anthony's you see?  He's right here.  Why is your...  You're over here.  Your eyes are totally tearing.  Like, you're crying, tearing.  Look, there's tears running down your face.  And you can't keep them straight.  Yrock, why are you crying?  Look who he looks for.  I have no idea.  Those are called tequila eyes.  Are you okay?  No, they're called tequila eyes.  But I see his lip is quivering, too.  Yrock's crying! 
[00:51:00]  What's happened?  I'm fine.  He's crying.  He's crying.  This is fucking bizarre.  It's not watery eyes.  He's actively crying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why are you crying?  I see his lip quivering.  Why are you crying?  I'm not.  Maybe I need a donut.  He doesn't think he's crying.  I don't like chocolate.  That isn't just tears. 
[00:51:30]  Like, when something goes down.  He's...  What's the matter?  That tastes awful.  That tastes awful.  Wow, man.  Yeah, that was the first crying episode.  Amazing.  Where it was like, wow, his eyes are like glassy.  Your eyes went from drunk glassy, which, you know, we've all seen.  And to just like welling up to running down your cheeks.  You're like, what the fuck?  That was so weird. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I was not really aware.  Until you kept pointing it out over and over.  And then I'm like, oh, yeah.  It's like, uh-oh.  The only reason we kept pointing it out over and over again, it was so bizarre to not know  you were crying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was so strange to me.  Yeah, I didn't even know it had started at that point, no.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't just a little.  I mean, tears were pouring out of your eyes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Tears in his eyes, I guess.  Yeah.  Gonna squirt?  Gonna squirt?  Gonna squirt?  Is that it for the clips? 
[00:52:30]  Those are pretty good clips.  Yeah, we got, they're coming in little by little, but Sam's coming up to show me one  right now.  Yeah.  My dad was here, he would have called you a pissy eyes.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it's fucking great.  So what's going on?  Should we break?  Whatever you guys want to do.  I mean, I'm trying to, the folder's taking a little while to load all the clips that are  coming in.  Oh, we got more clips worth playing than Sam? 
[00:53:00]  What do you want?  I mean, there's a million of them.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I just pulled a clip of Eric being very confident.  You know, you always talk about Confident E-Rock.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  After show Confident E-Rock was as confident as I've ever seen any person.  Wow.  Especially when Nicole walked in.  Really?  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, we take a little break and we might play more clips from the big Friday show,  Tequila and Donut Day.  I'd love to hear that one, Confident E-Rock.  Yeah, Confident E-Rock.  I really will.  I've never seen it.  Right now, if you want to.  It's a minute long.  If you want to just show it.  Yeah, we'll play it after the break because there might be a couple more that come in  to finish up this whole thing. 
[00:53:30]  All right?  All right.  On Sirius XM.  News of the world.  Opie and Anthony.  Hollywood radio show to the stars.  Silver screen heavy hitter Donald Sutherland was on the Opie and Anthony show and had a ball.  Jesus, this is the most depressing show.  I feel totally alienated.  And you actually have listeners.  Mr. Movie Magic Donald Sutherland told all.  He was more starstruck by both the Opie and Anthony fellas than they of him. 
[00:54:00]  When I came in here, I was terrified.  Absolutely terrified.  Who booked me into this show?  Donald!  Donald!  Before you leave us, tell us, please.  Did you have fun with Opie and Anthony?  Did I have fun here?  Oh, I'm so happy it's finished.  Stay tuned as News of the World continues to take an inside look at the lives of silver  screen studs and starlets on Opie and Anthony, Hollywood radio show to the stars.  Sirius XM. 
[00:54:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning, everyone.  Hope everyone had a good weekend.  It was one of those drinking weekends, I guess.  St. Paddy's Day.  St. Paddy's Day.  They had the big parade here in New York City on Saturday and then Sunday, yesterday, was  the actual day, right?  I'll tell you something.  You know, you were talking about the parade in Huntington outside FH Riley's last week.  Yes.  And how it's just sucked.  Yeah.  I was watching a little bit of coverage on TV of that St. Paddy's Day parade here in 
[00:55:00]  the city in Manhattan.  It looked the same.  It just looked like it sucked.  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's just people marching around with green hats.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  Did parades always suck?  I don't know.  When you got a parade with no floats.  Right.  I think it sucks.  Well, I mean, you know, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade is awesome.  And it really is.  Because I don't mind watching that.  The balloons, the fucking floats, the music.  I used to live a half a block from the parade route.  So we would just kind of, you know, stagger out of bed and just kind of go a half a block, 
[00:55:30]  stand there and check it out.  It's kind of cool to check out live with all the floats going by.  But every other parade, why?  It's so stupid.  The St. Paddy's Day parade.  It's just a bunch of drunks marching.  Then you got some firemen.  Right.  Then you got some cops.  Right.  And then you got bagpipes.  Right.  And then you got some cops.  Right.  And then you got drunks.  And then you got firemen.  Then you got bagpipes.  Yeah, they just keep rotating the same shit.  Is the parade only a couple blocks long and they just keep it in one big circle? 
[00:56:00]  You can't have a parade where you look at half the people and go, wait a minute, you  should be on this side of the fence.  Yeah, yeah.  You should be watching the parade, not in it.  You should be watching the parade like I am.  What makes you special?  That you're marching down Fifth Avenue.  Yeah, it made no sense whatsoever.  Were there politicians involved?  Yeah, Bloomberg was in there.  Oh, Bloomberg.  Yeah.  We should just throw our big gulps at the dope.  Yeah.  Bloomberg.  He was there.  Yeah, a bunch of, you know, politicians are out there pressing the flesh. 
[00:56:30]  I actually watched for maybe two minutes.  It's terrible.  And I had the same thought you had.  Just there's no reason for this anymore.  And I guess NBC was covering it and they had the cameras set up where there was like  viewing stands for dignitaries, I guess.  Okay.  And no one, like no regular people in the crowd on the sides of the street.  Right.  So you weren't even getting like seeing some drunks holding up their drinks and going,  woo, not even that. 
[00:57:00]  It was the worst coverage I've ever seen of a parade, of a horrible parade.  Of a horrible parade.  Yeah.  I mean, bagpipes are great.  The first five groups of people that go by with them, I guess.  Right.  After that, you're like, really?  It's all you got?  Fucking bagpipes?  Yeah, I wasn't filling it, yo.  And then Sunday, I guess, was actually St. Paddy's Day.  So it was kind of a two-day, you know, bender.  The whole weekend. 
[00:57:30]  To go on.  Yeah.  Good excuse to get a couple days in, right?  Yeah, you know.  Well, yeah, I had a little, a few Guinness, a few of them Guinness for the occasion.  It was snowing during the parade, too.  Right.  Saturday, we had some snow in the area.  Didn't stick, though.  It's not going to stick.  It'll be fine.  The parade will go off without a hitch. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, so it just sucks.  That's what it is.  It's a bunch of people with, like, fucking sashes.  They're wearing green sashes.  But this is just a crowd of people walking down Fifth Avenue.  Like, who are these people?  We're looking at a clip right now.  Like, who are they?  Who are they?  It's just a bunch of people going, I guess I'll just march in the parade.  Yeah, doesn't that look like it should be...  Oh, it's snowing.  ...just people watching the parade?  Yeah.  It's like a dad carrying his kid.  You should have the kid up on his shoulders watching this shit. 
[00:58:30]  Look, there's no...  It stinks!  That was just so you didn't see drunks, though.  That's all that was.  Is it?  Yeah, they don't want it to turn into, you know, the coverage of the Puerto Rican Day parade  they had a few years ago.  They want it to seem like a nice event.  But it's not a nice event.  There's nothing really to it anymore.  I don't know when it changed, or maybe it was always just who gives a fuck.  They got a lot of cops on the parade route keeping people from drinking, by the way.  So it's not even like...  Oh, okay.  The old days of the St. Paddy's Day parade here in Manhattan, 
[00:59:00]  used to be, from what I knew, people from Long Island would hop on the railroad,  go in, get fucking obliterated.  That was still happening.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What they do at the parade is they go way uptown where it's a little more chill.  Ah.  See, that's what you're kind of seeing.  Ah.  But you get more toward midtown and all that.  It still happens.  Yeah, it gets a little crazy?  Yeah, we used to broadcast live on a few St. Paddy's Day.  I mean, remember, just trying to get to the broadcast, it was just a whole bunch of drunks. 
[00:59:30]  In this area.  But that was a while ago.  I mean, the cops have really cracked down on fucking drinking, man.  Yeah, no, I saw plenty of people kind of drunk wandering around this weekend in New York City  with their green hair, and yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's still happening.  Definitely.  The Long Island Railroad apparently banned any kind of booze on their trains until Sunday morning.  Oh, so they are definitely trying to cut it down. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, they're definitely trying to crack down on the boozy factor.  I definitely saw enough.  Enough people.  Yeah, whatever.  Like it used to be, you know.  More importantly, we almost lost Lil Wayne over the weekend.  My God.  Thank God he's okay.  Oh, God.  TMZ was so excited.  Did you follow this at all?  What a who cares?  You like Lil Wayne?  I like Lil Wayne.  Well, TMZ had him dead.  TMZ had him in a coma.  TMZ said they're just waiting for Lil Wayne's mom to fly in to basically pull the plug.  TMZ said he was given his last rights. 
[01:00:30]  Well.  TMZ went all the fuck in, and then, I don't know, six or eight hours later, they deleted  everything off their site.  They got the wrong info from somebody.  Damn.  But they had Lil Wayne basically dead.  In critical condition after more seizures.  Right.  That's what we got now?  Is that current?  No, no, no, no.  Okay.  No, that's all stuff that is just not true.  How's Lil Wayne now?  Lil Wayne's doing all right, right? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, I mean, I think he might...  He tweeted even and said he was doing all right.  Was it from the Sizzurp?  That's what it was from, yeah.  What is Sizzurp?  Oh, man.  Prescription cough syrup with Mountain Dew and Jolly Ranchers.  Wow.  It's one recipe.  Fuck it.  Who invented that?  Of the black community.  Rappers in the South have been...  Yes.  There was another, I think, either Pimp C or Bun B. One of those two died from drinking  too much of it.  Too much Sizzurp.  I guess you don't realize how much you're getting fucked up. 
[01:01:30]  It's like, uh, uh...  So what?  You sip this shit?  Yeah.  You get prescription-strength codeine.  Right.  And then you mix it with whatever...  Well, usually Mountain Dew, but it could be Sprite or...  Sprite, right.  ...you see Lil Wayne use cream soda.  Uh-huh.  Tasty.  And then you throw in some Jolly Ranchers because it's not sweet enough.  For flavor.  Oh, my God.  How is it not sweet enough?  And you drink it out of a Styrofoam cup.  Or three Styrofoam cups.  Right.  I think Iraq should have some Sizzurp.  Sizzurp.  Iraq, you want to do some Sizzurp?  No, I'm good.  Sizzurp?  Yeah.  It's just hilarious. 
[01:02:00]  Why don't you just...  You can call it Sizzurp or Drank.  Right.  Drank.  Yeah.  Where's my Drank?  Do that cause actual seizures in Lil Wayne?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Man.  Codeine, I guess.  Right.  Do they call it beverage?  I'd like my beverage, please.  I don't think it's beverage.  Might I have my drink?  Yes.  But Lil Wayne's had a huge problem with it for a long time.  Oh, yeah.  He's addicted to the Sizzurp.  He drinks Codeine constantly.  Really?  Jesus.  Well, that can't be good for you after a while, huh?  Like, if you saw...  They put out a documentary. 
[01:02:30]  You saw it, Ian.  Oh, yeah.  I loved it.  And he was taking full two-liter bottles of soda and adding Codeine to it.  Yeah.  And then just mixing the two-liter bottle.  Yeah.  And just drinking it.  What does the Codeine do to you?  Fucks you up.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That gives you this lethargic kind of...  Yeah, man.  It's the NyQuil buzz kind of?  Yeah.  It's very morphine-ish.  On a lower level.  But, yeah.  It's kind of a...  Yeah, motherfucker.  I bet you he was fucked up on that when he testified in that. 
[01:03:00]  Remember the funny audio of him?  Classic.  He had to be.  Classic.  He was on the Sizzurp.  Yeah.  He was obviously addicted to it.  I don't know what Codeine does exactly, but I know it really gets you fucked up.  His best friend slash manager stopped riding the tour bus with him because he couldn't  see him because he was fucked up all the time.  And he was like, I can't see him like this anymore.  Jeez.  And that was years ago, so...  Right.  Well, now it got to the point where it caused seizures.  I guess so.  And they were saying that he was given his last rites and that rappers were gathering 
[01:03:30]  at the hospital.  Yeah.  All that shit.  They do have pictures of Nicki Minaj and Birdman showing up at the hospital.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Nicki Minaj.  Who's the Birdman?  Of Alcatraz?  Bird, bird, bird.  Bird, bird, bird.  Not that Birdman.  Oh.  Although he really wasn't Leavenworth, if anybody wants to.  Ah.  A little fun fact.  Right.  Just directly.  I like Lil Wayne because he kind of embraces metal.  Like, he likes fucking...  He likes metal, so I kind of like that as a rapper. 
[01:04:00]  He is talented.  He's weird.  He really embraces metal, though.  Like, now he wears, like, tight pants.  He wants to be like a...  Like an 80s...  It's crazy.  ...hair metal rocker.  Yeah.  Doesn't have his britches down around his ass.  No, they still sag, but they're, like, skin-tighty.  Where's jeggings?  Oh.  That was nice.  Does he come up here at all?  I would love to get him on the show.  I've never seen him up here.  No?  Ah, ha, ha.  It's pretty hard to get.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Fucking start crying, you piece of shit.  New York much. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Do we have audio of that?  The fucking rapists.  The fucking rapists.  They were in Ohio.  Oh, my God.  They were found guilty.  Ohio teens convicted of rape.  Do we have audio of that guy crying like that?  I hope so.  We, uh, no, we do not.  They got a year, right?  At least, I think.  One guy got, the one part I don't agree with, the one guy getting two years or an extra year  for putting photos of her because she's underage.  But, I mean, he's 17, she's 16.  There's something with that age thing that kind of bugs me if you're the same age. 
[01:05:00]  But photography is a whole different game.  Yeah, it is.  When you post fucking pictures of underage, it goes beyond just consenting teens.  That's true.  Teens.  All right.  That's craziness.  Hey, if I can't do it, no one can.  But, I mean, I don't know enough about this case.  Like, I know it's a brutal, like, did they fuck her or just finger her?  Like, I did not.  I don't know all the details.  Yeah, I think they got them on the digital insertion.  The case that has captured the nation's attention.  Two teens accused of raping a drunken 16-year-old girl during a booze-fueled night of partying 
[01:05:30]  learned their fate today.  The high school football players for Steubenville's Big Red never took the stand, but maintained  their innocence throughout.  But the judge found them guilty on all counts.  Tenant's Poppy Harlow was in the court for the entire trial.  Poppy?  Poppy.  Hi there, Don.  Well, as you know, this case has put the town of Steubenville, Ohio, in the spotlight  for months.  But today, the judge made his verdict known to all. 
[01:06:00]  The mother of the 16-year-old victim spoke out for the first time since Trent Mays and  Malik Richmond raped her daughter, saying this after court ended.  It did not matter what school you went to, what city you lived in, or what sports you've  played.  Human compassion is not taught by a teacher, a coach, or a parent.  It is a God-given gift instilled in all of us.  You displayed not only a lack of this compassion, but a lack of any moral code.  Your decisions that night affected countless lives, including those most dear to you. 
[01:06:30]  You were your own accuser through the social media that you chose to publish your criminal  conduct on.  Criminal.  This does not define who my daughter is.  She will persevere, grow, and move on.  Good luck with that.  I have pity for you both.  I hope you fear the Lord, repent for your actions, and pray hard for his forgiveness.  The convicted rapists, both teenage boys, showing remorse after being found guilty.  I would truly like to apologize to our family, my family, and the community. 
[01:07:00]  I would like to apologize to you.  I have no intention to do it.  I'm sorry to put you guys through this.  What's up there, tough guy?  Going to prison, tough guy?  I'm sorry, I didn't want you to say it.  Ah.  I don't know what I like.  The 16-year-old girl was raped during a series of late-night parties in August when she was 
[01:07:30]  drunk.  The court is able to view the demeanor of the witnesses, judge their credibility, and weigh  the evidence presented to the court.  The court has done so in this case, and it is the court's decision that both of the defendants  are hereby adjudicated delinquent beyond a reasonable doubt on all three counts as charged. 
[01:08:00]  Malik Richman, sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile correction facility for  rape.  Trent Mays, to a minimum of two years, guilty of rape and of taking and distributing an illegal  nude photograph of the victim.  Both Mays and Richman will also have to register as juvenile sex offenders.  Prosecutors said the girl was so intoxicated she wasn't capable of consenting to anything.  This case is about a 16-year-old girl who was taken advantage of, toyed with, and humiliated. 
[01:08:30]  And it's time that the people who did that to her are held responsible.  Eyewitness testimony from three teenage boys, all friends of Mays and Richman, and all granted  immunity from criminal prosecution, was damaging.  One witness saying he videotaped Mays performing a sexual act on the girl during a car ride between  parties.  Two others testified they saw Richman do the same later that night, while she was lying 
[01:09:00]  naked on the floor.  In the state of Ohio, this act, performed without consent, constitutes rape.  There seems to be an unbelievable casualness about rape and about sex.  It's a cavalier attitude, a belief that somehow there isn't anything wrong with any of this.  Text messages, tweets, and photos were at the center of the trial. 
[01:09:30]  Fellow teens vulgarly joked about the rape.  Song of the Night is definitely Rape Me by Nirvana.  What if that was your daughter?  But it isn't.  If that was my daughter, I wouldn't care.  I'd just let her be dead.  Witnesses read text messages, including this one, about the victim from Trent Mays to a friend.  Yeah, dude, she was like a dead body.  I just needed some sexual attention.  Now, in addition to handing down this sentence, the court ordered that Trent Mays and Malik 
[01:10:00]  Richmond also receive treatment while they are serving time to ensure that they do not  commit another sex crime.  Additionally, Ohio's Attorney General Mike DeWine held a press conference where he said  that a grand jury will be convened here to determine whether or not others committed crimes  in this incident.  God, it's horrible.  They're going after everybody.  But only a year, man.  I have a couple questions.  One, did they have to consent to allowing it to just be a judge?  Why didn't they take a jury trial? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, they did have to.  They had to agree to that.  They went with that.  Yeah, yeah.  That was terribly dumb.  Really?  Because they assumed that in front of a fucking jury, they would really get fucked up.  Oh, maybe.  Oh, yeah.  They wouldn't have a shot against a jury.  Then the judge will probably handle it with the least amount of emotion as possible.  Right.  But they also were football.  To be completely devoid of humanity here, that's a football town.  Mm-hmm.  And that was a tremendously polarizing case. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  And a lot of people might have thought, well, these young men look...  Look, OJ got off, for fuck's sake.  It's like, I don't know what I would have went with there if I was them.  But, like, social media.  Oh, yeah.  Besides doing that, which is awful, how dumb are you?  Right.  Like, do people not...  Like, I guess because when we were teenagers, we talked shit.  Yeah.  Like, you'd talk about it and tell your friends, and this is how people talk now.  Right.  They talk on Twitter.  They talk on video.  Just amazing.  I think they did get off.  A year is easy. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know.  Like, I have weird feelings about that being called rape.  Even though I understand they should go to jail for it.  Right.  I don't think fingering somebody is rape.  Maybe women will fucking hate me for that.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Yeah, maybe the women should call up on that one.  No, I just...  Because I think rape...  I'm sure they feel violated.  Having anything inside, I'm like that.  There should be something that is a code that's a sexual violation or something.  I just...  Rape, to me, is when you put your dick in somebody.  Rape is almost like a...  I think fingering is just as bad if she's not fucking aware or, you know, wanting that. 
[01:12:00]  Rape is fucking a beating, a violent, a fucking somebody.  I'm not saying that they shouldn't go to jail.  I'm happy with them getting a year for this.  Fine.  I just don't think it should be called rape.  It's some kind of a sexual violation.  I just think...  I probably should have got more time is what I'm saying.  A year is like, fuck.  Yeah, I'm fine with that.  That's nothing.  And the one guy might get two?  Well, yeah.  They're pieces of garbage.  And there are these guys with this football culture who think they could do no wrong.  I believe they're shitty guys.  They could do whatever they want.  I'm sure, you know, that fucking guy that's weeping in the courtroom was laughing his ass off. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, he's fucking carting her around like a piece of meat.  And they were talking about pissing on her and fucking...  Are they...  Did they cum on her too?  Is that true?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They jacked off on her?  Yeah.  Fucking...  All right.  Yeah.  It's just fucking animals.  They don't...  You know.  It's terrible.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck.  They're lucky they're on their age.  Yeah.  How many years would that be if they were of age?  Boo.  Yeah, that would have been a biggie.  They're extremely lucky.  Yeah, that's a big fucking case. 
[01:13:00]  Certainly their names will be tainted and all that, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse, I'm thinking.  And I heard Candy...  Do we have any Candy Crowley clips?  Ugh.  That fuck.  No, because there was a big story about her.  Yeah.  Because she would...  The way she...  Raped the debate?  Yes, and she raped the cookie jar.  Fat face.  Was that...  She seemed like she was showing empathy for the guys, like how sad it was to watch the guys live.  Yeah.  Really?  We don't have that?  Okay. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, hey, look at Confident Sam.  We'll find it.  Ugh.  This guy's going to explain the difference between a fingering and a rape.  Brandon in Virginia, what's up there, buddy?  Oh.  Hey, I just...  I don't know how it is in Ohio, but in Virginia, there's rape, and then there's forcible  sodomy.  That's sodomy?  Wow, okay.  Yeah, it's considered forcible sodomy under the code in Virginia, anyway.  Isn't there, like, something different? 
[01:14:00]  Like, I never do...  There's something called sexual misconduct, I think, where...  That's if you're on a date with a girl, and you're fooling around, and she says, don't  do it, and you put your dick in.  They don't classify that as rape.  Or maybe they didn't, but they called it sexual misconduct.  But I think that should be rape, because you're sticking your dick in somebody.  Yeah.  I believe now that's still considered rape.  It's just day rape.  But under the code, it's still rape.  Well, in Ohio, even as a digital penetration, it's considered rape.  That's what they say.  That's fucking rape.  Right.  Okay.  They don't break it down in Ohio. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, maybe that's better.  Or in that area of Ohio.  Maybe that's better, because it protects women.  Anything else, Brandon?  No, I was in punching out.  All right, man.  Let's go to Christy in Connecticut.  Christy.  Hi.  Hey.  How are you this morning?  Hi, Christy.  All right.  Listen, I just want to add on to what Jimmy said.  I think that rape may be a little strong.  Again, I don't know the whole product of the whole case, but what about sexual assault?  I mean, I'm kind of on the same lines as Jimmy.  Did they actually penetrate her?  Was it just a finger? 
[01:15:00]  And the other thing is, why is she 16 years old drunk with all those dudes?  Where was her mother?  Yeah, exactly.  Okay, fine.  But teenagers do that stuff.  You know, I agree with you about the sexual, I think sexual assault is more likely, or more  comfortable than rape.  It sounds like that to me, but it doesn't matter that she was, she just got fucked up at a  party, and she was stupid, and she shouldn't have, but they really were fucking way, they  were awful.  You're blaming the victim?  No, I'm not blaming the victim, but where is her responsibility? 
[01:15:30]  Well, her responsibility, yeah.  Yeah, it was pretty bad judgment to get fucked up.  But that doesn't all of a sudden relieve you of your rights as a human being to not be fucked  with no matter how drunk you are.  Those guys are animals.  They weren't thinking about anything at that point.  This is not just one guy, like the different, if this was one guy who hooked up this girl  at a party, and he fingered her, and he fucked her, and he fooled around with her, and they,  it's a different mentality than in a room like that, and filming it, and fucking jerking 
[01:16:00]  off on it, that's a fucking, that's a really, that's the type of thing where if they were  all five or six years older, that probably would have turned into a brutal gang rape.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.  Why are you putting yourself in that situation, though?  I mean, like, use your head, if you're going out with five dudes, what do you think's gonna  happen?  By the end of the night, if you're drunk, and you don't think anything's gonna happen,  you're stupid.  You're right, that was stupid, and she was, she should have made better judgment, where 
[01:16:30]  the fuck were her friends, like, sometimes the cock-block friends are needed, but that's  still, just because she was dumb and she made some stupid decisions, doesn't mean that she  deserves that shit.  Uh-huh.  Well, no, I didn't say shit, sir.  No, I know.  But, you know, I mean, you just, you have to use your head, especially in this day and  age.  I mean, use your head.  Show me your friends, I'll show you, I'll show you you.  Yeah, you should protect yourself better, I mean, be a little smarter.  All right.  But it's hard when you get drunk.  I mean, any rational person, you're talking to rational people right now. 
[01:17:00]  The problem is, when you start drinking, you're like, I can fucking drive.  Yeah.  Like, most drunk drivers who kill people, if you sat them down as sober people, would  go, oh, no, I never want to kill anyone.  You make bad decisions when you're drunk, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  All right, Christy, thank you.  Let's go to Keith.  He's a cop in Detroit.  Keith.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Keith.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up, Keith?  Hey, I follow a little bit of this case.  And they, the defense attorney said that they didn't find any type of bodily fluid or semen. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, okay.  So they did penetrate her digitally, which is with the fingers and everything else.  And also, they also brought out the trial that she had been pursuing these two guys earlier in the day and like the weeks before.  So, you know, she knew these guys and she wanted to get down with them.  But she got drunk that night and they did take advantage of her.  Hey, Keith.  Keith.  Could you hand the phone to the cop? 
[01:18:00]  What do you mean?  Just hand it up to the front seat and let's talk to the officer.  Dick Anthony.  Jesus.  I saw it in before you guys when the one chick got slapped out in Seattle, remember?  Yep.  Yeah.  Hey, Keith, let me, because obviously she was into these guys or whatever, but it's amazing.  Like, when you see them, they sunk themselves, like, with their text messages and all this shit. 
[01:18:30]  Like, that stuff is admissible evidence.  Like, what dumb, what arrogant, dumb motherfuckers would do that?  Just assuming that that stuff wouldn't go anywhere?  How do you think that's okay to do?  Right.  Yeah.  That would put up a red flag with people, obviously.  Hell yeah.  All right, brother.  I got to go to Mark.  Thank you, Keith.  He's furious with the girl that was just on, Christy.  Mark, go ahead.  In Chicago.  Oh, how are we doing?  All right, buddy.  That lady's so full of shit.  So is our last guy.  Number one, if you know the background of this thing, these guys call themselves the rape  crew.  This is not the first time they've done it. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, they do.  They get away with this all the time.  Oh, okay.  It's a culture that lives in this town.  They have nothing there but these frickin' football players.  Number two, that girl was set up by another guy she blew off.  I won't say his last name.  His first name's Cody.  He's going to get a civil suit.  He's going to be arrested, too.  Wait, hold on.  What do you mean?  Slow down.  Don't say his name.  But another guy set her up with those two guys?  Wait, and slow down.  Hold on.  And back up.  They were known as the rape crew, so they did this type of thing before?  Yeah.  If you go back and look, that's what they called themselves. 
[01:19:30]  There's three other girls that they've done this to.  So they assumed they were untouchable, that they could get away with some of this shit.  Gotcha.  Exactly.  That's the culture.  Number two, she broke up with another guy.  You're going to hear his name soon.  Okay.  He set her up, and he told her, come to this party.  He wanted her to come with these guys.  She came to dump it.  Oh, her mother.  Did that dumb bitch go to every party with her mother when she was 16?  What a frickin' stupid thing.  No, but, dude, hold on.  I don't think that that girl was saying she deserved it.  I think she's saying, like, where's your judgment? 
[01:20:00]  Protect yourself.  My judgment was, she was going out with her friends like every kid does when they're 15.  Yeah, man.  But she still used bad judgment.  She, exactly.  I'm sorry to get upset, guys, but it's just, she got set off by this other dickhead who's  going to get arrested.  Where was one fucking person in that room to say, hey, guys, what the fuck are you doing?  This is going way too far, right?  There was one guy.  It's a fucking human being, man.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[01:20:30]  Police up your dicks.  There was one guy that did it.  He got on the phone, and he screwed up the one dude that got arrested, or who got convicted.  He got, his phone died.  It was his cousin, and he said, what the F are you doing on somebody else's phone?  And that was, that was evidence.  Right.  One guy, and I, exactly.  Wait, what do you mean he was on someone else's phone?  I'm not sure what you mean.  His phone died.  His cousin's phone died.  Okay.  His cousin saw what was going on.  I heard about it.  He got on the phone, so he had to use somebody else's phone. 
[01:21:00]  What happened, they grabbed all the phones and deleted all the evidence wrong.  15 other assholes who still might get it.  The point is, to answer that nice young lady who seems to go out with her mother every day  and doesn't want to go out and give the kid any, the victim any credit here, like Crowley,  that fat ass on CNN yesterday.  These poor, poor kids.  Oh, poor kids.  Fuck those kids.  Those fucking poor kids went out and fucking raped the girl.  I don't think the, dude, I don't think, I know what you're saying about Candy Crowley,  but I don't think that the last girl who called in was saying that. 
[01:21:30]  Well, okay, but what she doesn't understand, when the young lady got in the car, she was  given a roofie or a date rape.  That's why her judgment was not.  Oh, yeah, yeah, she might have been, yeah.  Right.  She was.  There's no doubt about it.  She was given a rape.  So when you sit there and make judgment on somebody, look at the person who's doing it.  But was she absolutely given one?  Because she thinks she was.  What's the proof of that?  Well, Jimmy, what happened was, after 24 hours, it was all about not being able to  do a piss strike because it was too late. 
[01:22:00]  She was absolutely given a roof.  Well, where's the proof of that?  Yeah, is there any proof of that?  There's no proof of that.  There's been talk about it.  Any witnesses?  There's just talk about it.  But there's no proof for a court of law, unfortunately.  I was part of the crepe crew, Jimmy, where we made wonderful breakfasts for everybody.  It's funny, when I was in high school, I was part of the drape crew.  We went to all windowless homes and helped them.  I mean, all curtainless homes, windowless homes.  Wouldn't need the drape crew.  We could go to all talentless places where I'd be well at home.  Wow.  Thank you for calling, buddy. 
[01:22:30]  If there wasn't any legal, if I could stand up in court, there'd be 15 of these assholes  sitting right next to me.  Yeah, I saw some video of some kid that's sitting on an ottoman or a couch at one of these  parties, and just going on for almost a half hour, 45 minutes, just babbling about how  this girl was passed out dead.  He's making all kinds of jokes.  He's another fucking son of a bitch.  He's just pieces of shit.  He got kicked out of Ohio State for that.  He got kicked out of school for that, at least.  Oh, did he? 
[01:23:00]  Good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  He was going to Ohio State, and his ass is still going to get down.  I mean, all these motherfuckers should go down for something, because for somebody to  not even just not goof about the thing, but to not say something is beyond me as a human  being, to not know, to not know that something bad and wrong is going on at that moment.  How about guys who were there with other girls?  Exactly, and the girls didn't fucking do anything either.  Hey, listen, I love you. 
[01:23:30]  You can't let me bet, man.  Thank you, Mark.  Thanks for the passion.  Holy shit.  We are in a weird fucking place in time, man.  We really are.  We lost this girl, Jenna.  She wanted in badly as well.  Maybe you could call back.  She was probably a fucking...  In high school, I was in the NAEP crew.  We would just go around touching necks.  The crape crew.  Yeah.  Seeing those kids crying, you know, the courtroom confuses you a little bit, certainly, but  fuck them in the end.  No. 
[01:24:00]  You know?  You got the clip of Candy Crowley feeling sorry for those guys?  Let's hear Candy Crowley.  This monster.  Fat apologist.  I cannot imagine, having just watched this on the feed coming in, how emotional that must  have been sitting in the courtroom.  I've never experienced anything like it, Candy.  It was incredibly emotional, incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what  happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very 
[01:24:30]  good students, literally watched as they believed their life fell apart.  One of the young men, Malik Richmond, when that sentence came down, he collapsed.  He collapsed in the arms of his attorney, Walter Madison.  He said to him, my life is over.  No one is going to want me now.  Very serious crime here.  Both found guilty of raping this 16-year-old girl at a series of parties back in August.  Alcohol-fueled parties. 
[01:25:00]  Alcohol, a huge part in this.  But Trent Mays was also found guilty on a second count, and that is of felony illegal use of a  minor in nudity-oriented material, because he took a photograph of the victim laying naked on the  floor that night.  Trent Mays will serve two years in a juvenile detention facility.  Malik Richmond will serve one year on that one count that he was found guilty for.  But I want to let our viewers listen, because for the first time in this entire trial, we have now 
[01:25:30]  heard from the two young men.  Trent Mays stood up apologizing to the victim's family in court after him, Malik Richmond.  Listen.  Can you pause for a second?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's up?  What a fucking disgrace CNN is.  Yes.  Where do you find these fucking, these apologist women?  Amazing, right?  That's embarrassing.  Fuck these young guys.  Who cares about that angle?  What kind of angle are they going for?  Who cares about these two? 
[01:26:00]  What a fuck, what an embarrassing cunt.  Do you know what?  Absolutely.  He's crying.  He's sad.  And did you hear what the problem is?  Not, oh my God, what did I do to that girl?  Her life is fucking ruined.  My life is ruined.  No one's going to want me.  I mean, it's like...  Who gives a fuck?  It's not about you.  It's not about your stupid life.  It's amazing.  Yeah, who cares?  You made that decision.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Amanda.  Amanda, the women want in badly today. 
[01:26:30]  Amanda in New Hampshire, what's up?  Good morning.  Sounds like a woman's...  Yeah, or Amanda.  What did the man say something and you didn't know the answer?  Don't get me started.  Chippy don't play that.  No, Chippy don't play that.  That's a good one.  I'm calling in response to the woman who was saying, where is this girl's mother?  Yeah.  She was 16.  When I was 16 and got my license, my mom thought I was somewhere, but I was really somewhere  else.  Yeah, you fucking tell me where you were.  Where were you? 
[01:27:00]  Where were you?  You were getting big dicks in your ass.  Yeah, hopefully not white ones.  My fantasies are different than that.  So where did you drive the whore-mobile?  And it was the fucking Oscar Mayer truck.  She'd just back it into herself.  Sorry, we're just riffing.  Go ahead.  Yeah, obviously teenagers are going to be fucking teenagers.  Oscar Mayer does not give you the right to take advantage of them as a human being.  Right.  It's wrong.  I think that's pretty obvious to most people. 
[01:27:30]  And we can't feel bad for them because they're crying in the courtroom.  Yeah, of course they feel bad.  They got caught and convicted.  Yeah, they're fucking crying.  That'll make most people cry.  I'm sure if they didn't get caught, they'd still be laughing about it.  Exactly.  Exactly.  They're pieces of shit, and they're crying because they're worried what's going to happen  to them when they go to jail.  They know that they're going to get some dicks up their ass.  It's nice to see whites and blacks work together, though, like that.  That's just teenage boy shit. 
[01:28:00]  I mean, I'm not saying boys being boys.  I mean, that's just, that could happen with a group of fucking white kids or a group of  black kids.  That's something that's fucking completely, has zero culture bias, is the ability to be  a cocksucker when you're drunk and do some horrible shit to a girl.  Right.  All right, Amanda.  Thank you.  It's one human being terrible to another human being.  Yeah, there's a basic human thing that's supposed to be in you.  Some kind of compassion, fucking empathy.  You know, there's that that's supposed to just be in the second you're born. 
[01:28:30]  You're not taught it.  You just know when something's not right.  Yeah.  And, you know, they should have known it.  Tony Rocky Hara, better well damn sure would have it.  Sociopaths don't have that.  When you say, like, how could somebody torture an animal?  Well, how could somebody torture a kid?  Like, I can't even comprehend.  Right?  How can you do it?  How?  I couldn't even watch certain things.  There's something, that empathy thing, man, that fucking thing, it just shuts off in these  people.  Yeah.  Which is why I think when we know who they are, we should kill them. 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  You think they're missing just a part of their brain or something?  Sociopaths.  A piece of their brain or something in the brain just isn't working or is  shut off because you're right.  Chemical goes left instead of going right.  You can't even imagine.  Is there more to the Candy Crawley clip?  Yeah, I want to hear what this fucking fat voice says.  Candy Crawley.  And, you know, something that came up throughout this sentence in Candy was that Malik's father  got up and spoke.  Malik has been living with guardians.  His father, a former alcoholic, got into a lot of trouble with the law, been in prison  before, and his father stood up and he told the court, I feel responsible for this. 
[01:29:30]  I feel like I wasn't there for my son.  And before that, he came over to the bench where his son was sitting.  He approached him.  He hugged him.  And he whispered in his ear.  And Malik's attorney said to us in the courtroom, I have never heard Malik's father before say,  I love you.  He's never told his son that.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck off you.  Can you fucking...  It's amazing.  They are trying to garner sympathy for these fucking pieces of shit.  And obviously, you know, the victim isn't going to go in front of cameras. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  You know, if the victim was in front of cameras crying, this would be a whole different story.  I'm amazed they're going with this.  This angle, right?  This is terrible.  What a fucking embarrassment CNN is.  Ugh.  This was an incredibly emotional day.  These two juveniles being carried out right now.  I'm watching people line up.  And they will be committed today.  Candy.  Poppy Harlow in Subbanville, Ohio for us. 
[01:30:30]  I want to bring in Paul Callen, our CNN legal contributor.  You know, Paul, a 16-year-old now just sobbing in court.  Regardless of what big football players they are, they still sound like 16-year-olds.  The other one, 17, a 16-year-old victim.  The thing is, when you listen to it and you realize that they could stay until they're 21,  they are going to get credit for time, sir.  They're not going to stay until 21.  What's the lasting effect, though, on two young men being found guilty in juvenile court of rape, essentially? 
[01:31:00]  Can you pause?  This is like a fucking sketch.  It's ridiculous.  Right?  I hate this fat cunt.  You're right.  It's like a sketch.  This is like a fucking SNL sketch.  Barely anything on the victim.  Where they twist the whole thing around and make it about these two poor juveniles.  They keep saying juveniles.  Give us a fuck about them.  Unbelievable.  Just focusing so much on them instead of the victim. 
[01:31:30]  Unbelievable.  What a fucking...  I guess they've got to drag the victim in front of cameras to get any type of sympathy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you cry on fucking camera, you know, you're going to get all the attention.  People are going to feel sorry for you.  Let's hear a little more of Candy Crowell.  Andy, we've seen here a courtroom drenched in tears and tragedy.  And, you know, Poppy's description, I think, you know, sums it all up.  But across America, scenes like this happen all the time.  I know as a prosecutor and a defense attorney, when that verdict is handed down, usually it's just the family, families of the defendants and the victims. 
[01:32:00]  There's always that moment of just lives are destroyed.  And lives have already been destroyed by the crime.  And we got a chance to see that.  But in terms of what happens now, yeah, the most severe thing with these young men is being labeled as registered sex offenders.  That label is now placed on them by Ohio law.  And by the way, the laws in most other states now require such a designation in the face of such a serious crime. 
[01:32:30]  That will haunt them for the rest of their lives.  As well it should!  When looking up their background, we'll see that they're registered sex offenders.  Unbelievable.  When they move into a new neighborhood and somebody goes on the Internet where these things are posted.  Thank God.  Neighbors will know that they're a registered sex offender.  It's really something that will have a lasting impact.  Much more of a lasting impact than going to a juvenile facility for one or two years.  Jesus.  And here's the beauty. 
[01:33:00]  This is why the media is such a repulsive fucking...  If you made fun of that, you'd be seen as being inappropriate or terrible.  These are the people who are supposed to be delivering unbiased information.  Right, right, right.  And that was...  How long is it, Sam?  Six minutes.  A six-minute piece about these poor guys who fucking...  Again, sexually assaulted, whatever you want to call it, raped this girl.  Hold on.  But out of the six minutes, how much time do they spend on the actual victim? 
[01:33:30]  We didn't just play the whole six-minute clip, right?  We jumped in the middle of it?  We played...  We didn't play the movie.  All right, so we played...  We just didn't play the crying, which we had played before.  Right, all right.  So we played...  In that clip, they barely mentioned the victim.  It was six minutes about how we should all feel sorry for these kids because they ruined their lives.  Right?  Yeah.  That's what I got out of that.  Wow, that's just amazing.  Hold on.  I'm tweeting them.  That's just amazing.  Un-fucking-believable. 
[01:34:00]  Basically, I mean, when I get out of that piece, CNN is saying, you know, they're way more important, those kids, than the victim.  Their lives are way more important than the victim's life.  Sentence boys younger than you did at the electric chair.  I didn't want to.  I felt I owed it to them.  Ode it to them.  That made me so fucking angry.  It's infuriating.  Why?  Because it's the football culture.  Their lives are way more important in that area than the victim's life.  But this fucking...  What's this other whore's name?  Poppy.  This cunt.  Poppy.  Trying to make it seem like there was a big moment because the guy's... 
[01:34:30]  Fuck him and fuck his absentee father.  Who cares?  Poppy.  Who gives a fuck?  Oh, Poppy.  And his father had a...  I don't give a fuck about why he did it.  Yeah.  Anthony's dad wasn't around the whole time?  No.  No.  Terrible.  I'm saying, like, you didn't turn into a rapist?  Round enough to call me pissy-ice.  And this case is out of Ohio, right?  Yep.  Didn't something else emotional happen in Ohio? 
[01:35:00]  Somewhere in Ohio.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I have no idea how this ends.  Why did I rape that woman?  I think God, this dream came true.  Same place, right?  Ohio?  Yeah.  Do you know, I think someone's tweeting me, this case was a huge cover-up that the hackers, 
[01:35:30]  Anonymous, brought out.  I think that's true.  Didn't Anonymous make this fucking...  Yeah, they did.  That's why I love Anonymous.  They found some shit online.  You hate them all you want, I'm all in with Anonymous, I'll tell you right now.  When they do stuff like this, I really, really like what they're doing.  They started to do more and more stuff like this.  That's great.  Like, real stuff.  They're the ones who brought up all the videos and the photos and all that stuff.  What happened?  They had been deleted?  Yeah.  Was this all deleted shit that Anonymous got?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  How did they...  They found it. 
[01:36:00]  Wow.  These guys are good.  Oh, it's all out there.  Oh, yeah.  They know how to go into Twitter's deleted areas or whatever?  Oh, yeah.  And they...  Yeah, they found that.  They printed the football coach's name and address and all that shit.  What did the coach have to do with this whole thing?  Well, I think he was trying to help in the cover-up.  Kind of like saying, fuck, let's try to...  Yeah, yeah.  It's just that, like, again, that whole football culture.  That whole culture.  Where they just...  Good for Anonymous, man.  Good for them.  Yeah.  Hey, let's remind the people we got the great James Lipton coming in today. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  I love his T.  Who has interviewed everyone.  No.  How come he's not James fucking Armton or James Lip Pound?  Yo, he's 86 years old?  Yeah.  Wow.  Get out of here.  He's that old?  Yeah.  86.  Holy fuck.  All right.  Lipton's coming in in about an hour or so.  So he's interviewed everybody.  We got to ask him the one person he hasn't interviewed.  Mm-hmm.  That he would like to interview. 
[01:37:00]  Ooh, what's this?  Huh.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out next.  The Opin' Entry Channel.  Oh, yeah.  On SiriusXM.  Hey, it's me.  God, you're so fucking...  I don't want to fucking move.  I'm crazy, man.  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you and...  Suck your tits. 
[01:37:30]  If you agree with this, say yes.  But yes, be in the best.  Yeah, I told that to hear it to her.  But I want to fucking lick your pussy and make you come so much.  No.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  Go out in the bathroom.  I'll leave you at the place now.  Bye.  Bye.  Bgehter. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...  From the land of the ice and snow.  From the midnight south of the hot stream.  You're so fucking hot.  I'm so fucking hating on.  I bet she's so jealous.  Oh, I'm going to be proceeding.  I'm going to get a chance. 
[01:38:30]  Make it crazy.  Fucking crazy.  I'm going to go with these arrested now.  Oh, I'm going to go with these arrested now. 
[01:39:00]  You have no more messages.  Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Well, that was a quick eight years.  Wow.  That's eight years ago.  So Terry Schiavo's feeding tube was removed there. 
[01:39:30]  We have any more Terry Schiavo bits, Iraq?  Yeah, we have a few more remixes that I can find.  Maybe should we make it Terry Schiavo Day?  Want to make it Terry Schiavo Day?  We did a lot of material on Terry Schiavo.  I just want to listen to this song.  Does that happen to you?  Yeah, you just stopped talking.  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, I'm on the radio.  Turn this up for a second. 
[01:40:00]  Turn to the door.  I walk right through the door.  Hey, all right.  Fuck it, buddy.  It's mine.  Mine, oh, mine.  There you go.  Ah, fuck.  Going to have to play that one later.  We have more clips from Iraq.  The big show is Friday. 
[01:40:30]  Iraq decided to do a theme show out of nowhere.  I mean, he surprised us.  We had nothing to do with it.  And he announced on Friday that it was going to be tequila and donut day.  And we thought no one would partake.  Thought it was going to be the dumbest idea ever.  But, man, we were wrong.  People are saying it's a career, a show highlight.  An Opie and Anthony show highlight for the ages.  Iraq ended up having 10 shots of tequila.  We said he did 13, but we didn't want to tell him that three of those shots were water. 
[01:41:00]  He had no idea.  He didn't know.  The official total was 10.  And a couple of those shots were some big shots.  So it was probably more than 10 shots of tequila.  And then you went on the after show.  This clip is from the after show, Sam.  Yeah, I mean, I invited Iraq to co-host with me.  Oh, nice.  What's that, Sal?  Eric left the song open playing.  Wait, you're blaming Eric?  Of course he is.  Eric's in here.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:41:30]  George W. Bush?  Eric, you just blamed him.  What do you blame?  George W.  How do you blame Iraq on that?  He's in here.  Sal was the one guy still giving Eric a hard time on Friday.  Really?  Where's handsome Johnny Tubesticks?  Where is the trade going down officially?  He's taking a well-deserved day off.  South by Southwest is over, so I think Johnny Tubesticks is on the table.  You'll be happy in your new home there, Sal. 
[01:42:00]  I don't want to do whatever he does.  You don't want to do anything.  Oh, he nailed you.  Do you even know what he does?  No idea.  Something in the music seems like you're just dragging music into a log all day.  No, I would definitely not stay here if that happened.  Whoa!  Hey, a little threat.  No, it's not a threat.  I just...  Oh, it's a promise?  I want to be here with you guys.  It must be nice to have some throwaway money.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm just going to throw my job away because I don't need the money. 
[01:42:30]  Fuck you, money right there.  It's going to fuck you, money at his age.  Would you do that when you were 23?  Would you be like...  Oh, my God.  You know how many times I want to throw my job away?  I didn't have that luxury.  You didn't like the better jobs?  Right.  I didn't have...  Like, he's saying it's a job in radio.  Yeah.  But he doesn't want to do that in radio.  He'd rather leave.  Right.  By the way, it's a job in...  Oh, there are plenty of jobs in radio I did not like doing, but I had no choice.  In New York.  New York.  In New York, right.  Yeah.  In my case, it was Rochester. 
[01:43:00]  How old did you, Sal?  22.  Ugh.  22?  I was still in college.  Sounds making a full-time salary with benefits.  At 22, I was in Geneva, New York, doing part-time radio, and then I went to fucking Rochester,  which I ended up loving.  I mean, I really like the people up there.  Yeah.  Then I moved on to Buffalo.  This kid's in New York radio and saying, ah, I would just leave.  I'd leave.  I'm not going to bring pizza for the jocks.  It might be a better gig for you, Sal.  Well, look, three shades darker than you. 
[01:43:30]  Jesus.  Are they on the same pay scale, Johnny Toobstakes and Sal?  I would think it's close, yeah.  Straight across trade?  Which, I mean.  Money-wise?  It's a bummer for tube stakes.  For tomorrow's show, could we get a list of, like, what he does?  Sal.  His job description.  And then Johnny Toobstakes.  Should Sal write his own job description?  Yeah, you want to do that, Sal?  Oh, God, that'd be great.  Yeah, whatever you guys want.  We should have an on-air review of Sal's performance.  Yes.  Which intern David was doing? 
[01:44:00]  David was great at those.  Remember David's reviews of people's performance?  I swear to you, it's one of my favorite bits.  They were so fucking mad, because every intern was way better than David, but we made David  the main guy, and he took it so seriously.  Did they hate his reviews today?  Oh, my God.  Because he searched for the flaws in everybody.  Oh, my God.  It was amazing.  He's just pointing out any little thing that every intern did wrong.  And they're sitting there yelling at him, you do nothing right ever. 
[01:44:30]  He's like, no, no, no.  If we play those clips, so...  That's not true.  Yeah, when he'd tell everybody what they did wrong, and they were contradicting him, you  just see his head start going...  Nope, nope, not true.  Getting in before he started talking, his head's already shaking.  Nope, nope, nope.  You think those clips still play, or it's...  Yes.  ...or it has passed us by?  No.  To me, those clips...  We'll replay that soon.  Yes.  Plus, Apprentice is still huge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe you can get me a few of those clips for tomorrow or something. 
[01:45:00]  I loved it.  He took it so seriously.  He had a suit on.  He had a suit on.  He made him sit down.  He had all his paperwork.  He did.  He was very official.  Oh, my God.  He was so official.  And he would bring up their strengths.  You start with the strengths.  And then he would also have...  Like a typical corporate douche.  Oh, it was.  He had the perfect structure for the whole thing.  Yeah.  Like the two Bobs from fucking Office Space.  Yeah, exactly.  Can you tell me what it is you do?  All right, Sal. 
[01:45:30]  Write up your job description today.  Maybe for the next break, all right?  Please.  Next break, sure.  All right.  E-Rock back in studio.  So the Tequila and Donut Day show was a huge success.  And then you went on Sam's show.  And we have one clip from your after show there?  Yeah.  I didn't want to go crazy with after show clips.  All right.  Let's listen to that now.  E-Rock was like, I think, maybe three shots deep.  Yeah.  He looked okay to me at that point.  What do you think now?  You're very sweet and delicious when you're drunk.  You should get drunk all the time.  You're very mushy and lovable.  You like it, Heather.  I think I can get Nicole at this point. 
[01:46:00]  You do.  You think you could fuck her if you weren't married?  I think so.  Wow.  Nicole.  You do.  Do you think he could?  He's confident.  He's charming.  Do you have to go?  All right.  Let me give you a hug.  Look at this.  Steve's lovable.  He almost hit her with his microphone by accident.  That was by accident.  That was not intentional.  But he made up with it with a hug.  No.  He's got no inhibitions.  You're very lovable right now.  I love this.  I'm adorable.  You really are.  You have your experience.  Yeah.  After 10 to 13 shots, we'll say, of tequila, what's that hangover going to be like? 
[01:46:30]  It's going to hurt like a motherfucker.  And when does that happen?  I mean, normally a hangover would occur the next morning.  After you fall asleep.  Even if he takes a nap this afternoon, he's going to wake up hung.  Like, if you close your eyes for like an hour or two.  Wake up hung.  Hung.  Hung.  Yeah.  Hung.  Well hung.  Morning BJ's.  That's how you get woken up by Nicole.  Nicole.  Oh.  I like his fucking, his confident voice, too, that he was doing.  Yeah.  Wake up.  Morning blowjob.  Wake up by Nicole.  All the girls were getting hugs. 
[01:47:00]  Heather B, right?  Heather B.  Heather B.  He likes the show, I think.  He was looking at, he looked at, actually, I think we have more Heather B clips.  Sal just told me if you want to hear it.  Is it worth playing?  Who's Heather B?  From the real world.  She works on the run.  First season?  Uh, Swayze show.  The original real world, New York?  Oh, the black girl came in?  Yeah.  Oh, I like Heather.  Heather B's all right.  She's all right.  What other clip you got?  Uh, this is where, uh, he brings in Heather B.  Into the after show.  All right.  Whoa.  Can I point out?  Show that up. 
[01:47:30]  Hey, I'm a good girl.  You're a good girl, Heather.  Yeah.  You can point out whatever you want, Heather.  I want to say something to Heather.  Say something to Heather.  Talk.  Because you're a bit younger than me.  I am.  You may have joined into the real world series a little bit later.  Mm-hmm.  What?  Heather, my favorite person on real world season one.  No.  That's incredible.  You were on there with, uh, true story.  I'm going to say, fuck Eric Neese.  Wow.  Wow, fuck him.  Who else?  The country guy, no one gives a shit about.  Who was the comic that dragged, I know him so well. 
[01:48:00]  That was season two.  That was David.  Oh, David Edwards.  And what do you think of David, Iraq?  David's awesome.  Right, but that's season two.  And the, uh, what's her name?  I can't.  Rachel?  The girl from, the girl he dragged out on season two.  Right, right.  Tammy.  Basketball Wives, right?  Yep.  Right.  But let's get back to season one.  Season one, Heather B, superstar.  Number one cast member.  Number one on that show.  Look.  And what do you say about the grind?  Eric Neese's show.  Fuck the grind.  Are they replaying that?  No. 
[01:48:30]  No one gives a shit about a dance show.  Nobody.  Right.  You know what?  He doesn't, you don't sound that drunk.  No.  He's confident.  He really doesn't sound that drunk.  Yeah, he's confident.  Every once in a while, he'll do that.  Yeah.  But.  But he's not sloppy like he was.  I don't feel like I'm listening to a guy that was ten shots in.  No.  No, not at all.  Where's Denny?  He's outside the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Over there.  All right.  Denny was part of the big tequila and donut day.  And he was great.  Consummate radio professional.  Absolutely.  I want to see how the rest of his day was. 
[01:49:00]  Here he comes.  That was Friday.  Of course.  Denny.  Dennis Falcone.  Dennis.  Is the mic hot?  Oh, yeah.  The mic is hot.  Oh, crap.  No.  No, you don't move the mic when it's hot.  We all know that now.  We learned that.  Denny's got a catchphrase.  What's your catchphrase?  Is this mic hot?  Is this mic hot?  Hey, everybody.  Denny, just go like this.  I know you're a constant radio professional.  Just go like this.  I kind of like not to move it because you don't want the people to hear what's happening 
[01:49:30]  behind the scenes.  Of course.  It doesn't give that air of professionalism.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't at all.  But doesn't that make it a little more interesting?  Well, sure.  But today is Motown Monday.  Oh, Motown Monday.  Is it Motown Monday?  Yeah.  Oh, so is that on the 60s channel?  Oh, it's always Motown Monday in my world.  Oh, oh.  And you see the way you could use that on Monday is on Broadway, there is a new musical opening  about Motown.  And then you could do a cross-promote to Soul Town here at SiriusXM, which plays a lot  of Motown.  So there's always a way to work pop culture things into cross-promoting. 
[01:50:00]  Do you think of any other channel besides this one at all?  I listen to the Pearl Jam channel and that's it because I don't have our channel in my  car.  Yeah, but I mean like...  That's literally the only channel.  But a listener.  I get it.  As a listener.  But as a guy employed here working, do you consider any other channel on that?  No, I wouldn't cross-promote any of these.  Exactly.  No.  Why?  It helps sell the value of the service.  Who cares, though?  You know, like there's a new show tonight, Bates Motel, you could promote the Elvis channel, 
[01:50:30]  Heartbreak Hotel, you play that, you kind of work things into...  Oh, would you do something like that?  Like, hey, tonight, premiering is...  Yeah, but now he's getting ahead of himself because he wants...  You should promote Motown Monday for us, the way you just did.  I could promote Motown Monday.  You need a song to...  How about Sal?  How about All I Need by The Temptations?  Ah, that's a good one.  Right?  It doesn't have enough ramp time.  Oh, we'll make it work. 
[01:51:00]  Do you know how much ramp time that song has?  I think it's got 12.  He knows that every song's ramp time.  If I did get Sal, all I need...  We call it the intro, Jimmy.  He calls it the ramp time.  Just give me some juice here.  Pump it up.  Turn it over.  Oh, it's a Motown Monday here at SiriusXM.  We always refer to these guys as being tan, tall, and talented.  And all I need is a Temptations on SiriusXM.  But you didn't do the cross-promote with Broadway.  Oh, that's great.  Well, I just...  Well, Broadway...  No, I just wanted to hit the song.  Okay. 
[01:51:30]  Well, I understand why.  And then, again, if you do a backsell...  Hey, by the way, if you love The Tempting Temptations, you can find lots of them over on SiriusXM's Soul Town.  Channel 49, nothing but classic, sold in Motown, 24-7.  That's it.  That's unbelievable.  He knows everything about the decades channels and...  It's the art of the Segway.  It is.  It is.  So, we want to know how the rest of your Friday was after the tequila shots.  All right.  You did three on Friday.  Yeah, I...  Were you feeling it the rest of the day?  I was a little sleepy by about 10 o'clock or so. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  And I just had a couple of pretzels and a couple of seltzers, and that took me right out of it.  Seltzer and pretzels.  Wow.  And you were right.  Yeah, yeah.  That was it.  Yeah.  I was feeling good.  And what did you have to do?  Feedback to work on the weekend shows.  Oh.  We have the doo-wop show on the 50s channel to take care of.  Norman Knight does two shows here on the weekend on the 50s channel.  So, there's lots of things going on.  You know, plus I'm always working on show prep and what's happening.  Show prep and what's happening.  Wow.  What is that?  What is in front of you?  It's always good to carry a clipboard around.  He carries...  And he does. 
[01:52:30]  He carries a clipboard.  Shows that you're busy, and you always just know what's going on.  Like, today, the NCAA tournament.  Everybody's talking about that.  Brackets, brackets, brackets.  Brackets, brackets.  So, you could talk...  What do you got on the brackets?  What do you got on the NCAA tournament?  I would cross-promote to the Mad Dog Radio channel.  Oh, very good.  Channel 86.  Where they're talking sports all night and all day.  But how would that sound?  On Mad Dog Channel?  No, I mean, how would the cross-promote sound?  Hey, boy, I tell you, if you were maybe playing a rubber ball by Bobby V.  Hey, that ball was bouncing by Bobby V. 
[01:53:00]  And speaking of bouncing, the NCAA tournaments, how's your brackets looking?  Well, check it out on SiriusXM Channel 86.  Mad Dog would be talking that NCAA action all day and all night long.  I swear to you, I wouldn't know what channel Mad Dog was on.  Dude, I was just going to say, people ask me, so you're on SiriusXM?  What channel are you on?  I don't even know what channel I'm on.  Never mind Mad Dog.  All right, I really do listen to the Pearl Jam channel a lot.  Yeah.  I don't know what number it is.  Don't know the number.  Well, that's why you have to do show prep ahead of time.  Well... 
[01:53:30]  I mean, again, we have a lot of channels here.  I don't know off the top of my head.  So you do a little prep.  You do a little prep work ahead of time.  You want to talk about that?  Sure.  You want to talk about the Ultra Music Festival, which is going down in a sunny FLA down in  Miami Way?  Down in Miami Way.  Yeah, there you go.  That's on SiriusXM Channel 52.  That's how you say Miami?  Also known as Electric Area, yeah.  Miami Way?  And the Sunshine State.  Do you do the left coast thing for LA?  Or KC and the Sunshine Band.  Maybe a little shake, shake, shake your booty.  Oh, from the Sunshine State.  Yeah, those guys came out of Hialeah, Florida. 
[01:54:00]  They did.  Back in 1975, I tell you, when this song came out of the AM radio, it just exploded.  Right?  When you heard Get Down Tonight?  Yeah.  I mean, it's a song that's changed my life.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, the whole disco thing and everything that was happening there.  Of course.  There's just so many great things.  I'm going to get the song.  Oh, why would Sal get the song?  What are you doing in there?  He's too busy.  His thumbs up his ass.  Sal, what's up?  Sal.  And you see another good cross-promote, then, if you're going to talk about that.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What, Sal?  I'm looking up KC and the Sunshine Band.  You just said you don't know how to spell KC and the Sunshine Band. 
[01:54:30]  I honestly didn't know if it was the letters or it was the word.  It's the letters.  Oh, my God.  Do you know what J-O is?  These kids are young.  A-H.  Holy fuck.  Or you could just look up.  CS.  How about E-Rock takes...  E-Rock, can you just go back in there?  Exactly.  Just squeeze back in there.  You could even cross-reference it by Get Down.  Or just look up Sunshine.  You got it now, Sal?  Well, look up and the...  Sal, you got it now?  I'm looking for it.  Oh, my God.  Which one are the deep tracks?  Yeah, it is.  It's one that's bare... 
[01:55:00]  No, it's not.  It's a power hit.  Oh, a little day.  Power category.  It's a power hit.  They're called power hits?  Yeah, it's a power.  What are the categories?  Well, you probably have A, your powers.  B is your subpowers.  C, your secondaries.  D, your tertiaries.  When I worked at BAB, we had the wow category.  Wow.  You're only allowed to pick one song out of the wow category per shift.  Why?  What would happen if you played two?  Oh, God.  I don't know, because I was too scared to break the rule.  Oh.  You guys don't have a cough button here, because if you have to clear your throat, just press  down the phone. 
[01:55:30]  You don't have that.  Because it's unprofessional to...  Well, yeah.  Are those noises great to hear, though?  I guess so.  Oh, Heath, you found it quicker than Sal did.  I could have had it a long time ago.  Yeah.  Okay, it's K.  C.  Do you want to...  We actually have engineers in there looking for the staff.  Oh, my God.  I know it's in there.  I could have brought my hard drive of hits in here for you.  He's got a hard drive of hits, we learned.  Right.  His hard drive of hits.  Why are you standing?  What's that?  Because you get better voice. 
[01:56:00]  Jimmy.  He thinks we should be standing as we broadcast.  I used to stand.  For years, we were on the afternoons, but I don't think it helps at all.  It just keeps your energy level up.  When you're sitting down, you kind of relax, sort of like that.  You've got to keep that energy.  Three o'clock in the morning, FM disc jockey thing.  Yeah, they start falling asleep.  No, not that.  Are overnight guys important in radio?  I think so.  Why?  Why?  Because they set up the morning show.  You know, if they have a good evening.  How can you set up the morning show if the morning show audience is sleeping?  I mean, you know, America is 24-7.  You've got guys working all night long, people working. 
[01:56:30]  You know, if somebody wants to hear something, call into an overnight show.  Let you know what's going on.  Hey, don't forget, coming up right after 6 o'clock this morning, Opie and Anthony are going  to be giving away tickets, too.  So they promote, and they push it ahead.  So they keep people listening.  Hey, Dane Cook, funny man Dane Cook, who's celebrating a birthday, might be stopping by  this morning with Opie and Anthony.  You never know what's going to happen there.  We're keeping it here.  Oldies all night long.  See?  Middays don't mean anything, though.  No, sure they do.  Sure they do.  They set you up for the lunchtime request show. 
[01:57:00]  Everything's just setting you for the lunchtime request show.  There's a lot of good things, a lot of good purposes.  And a good morning show, then you set the guys up to listen to the afternoon show.  Right, right.  Just keep the listener happy.  What about a night show?  Oh, a night show.  Without a doubt.  People going out to a ball game, going out to dinner, jumping in the car.  They want to find out what's going on.  Hit the radio.  Yeah.  Hit the radio.  Hit the radio.  What has regular radio has been wrecked?  What do you think has ruined regular radio?  Oh, there's a lot of things.  Limited formats.  Too many commercials on music channels. 
[01:57:30]  I went off an anti-Semitic tear for 20 minutes.  For no reason.  A lot of things.  That's why we've got satellite radio.  All these channels.  And it's just fantastic.  Do you mind if I move my hot mic?  You should probably hit the cough button.  I don't have a cough button.  You don't have a cough button.  I have one.  Yeah, I got one.  I hit it right there.  See?  There it is.  Yeah, you got the cough button.  That's nice.  Oh, I'm going to talk into a fan now.  I am your father.  That's what you do every time you eat pussy. 
[01:58:00]  You get it?  I also brought this other manual that I had when I worked at one radio station.  It's a manual about things to do and not to do in a radio station that was given to me when I worked at a radio station.  Wow.  Can we go through that?  Yeah, like using correct grammar.  Don't end sentences with prepositions.  What's that?  Use the correct verb tense.  It's, here are the Beatles, instead of saying, here is the association.  There's proper ways of saying things.  The association of the Beatles.  Stay put in the studio.  Any area in the station outside of the restroom is to be considered off-limits during an air shift. 
[01:58:30]  I don't like calling it an air shift.  I like calling it a show.  A shift is when you're, you know, loading a truck or working at McDonald's or something.  This is a show.  We're in entertainment.  So, I'm going to say, yeah, I've got to do a shift today.  I'm on the radio broadcasting this afternoon.  Wait, so you only stay in the studio or go to the bathroom?  Yeah, you should.  And that's it.  Well, you should because you have to know what's going on.  You know, before then, if you didn't have the internet, you'd be looking in the Joel Whitburn  books or looking up the newspaper and seeing, you know, what you could talk about.  Right. 
[01:59:00]  So you stay into your show.  Would you ever run out of the studio mid-shift to get a photo with a celebrity?  Uh, I'd ask the celebrity to come in.  Or would you just run out and abandon the show for a few minutes?  No, I don't think so.  I mean, you know, you have to bring the celebrity in and I think they'd want to, you know, promote  what's going on.  It's good to get the call letters and get the logo in the photo.  Because then when it hits the press, they'll see, wow, the Opie and Anthony show had so-and-so  in the studio.  What year did you start radio?  Uh, 1979.  Wow.  1979.  I remember 79.  Wow.  What are some of the other do's and don'ts? 
[01:59:30]  Well, let's see.  Always audition anything new.  Spots, promos, music.  Know what to expect.  How a spot or promo will sound before it hits the air.  Ah, what?  Like the intro and then the outro also, right?  The ramp time, yeah.  Especially if a record ends cold or if it fades or something.  Oh, boy, you've got to know that.  You know, and remember, you know, the proper IDs, you know, for the radio station.  What to say, what not to say.  You know, always work in the liners.  And the most important thing is your pacing.  Use the kind of delivery in a normal conversation.  Like if you're playing Morris Albert Feelings, you wouldn't want to be talking it up, you know, 
[02:00:00]  like screaming over the intro, you'd have to bring your voice down.  Because it's like, it's a love song.  Yeah, it's a love song.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, feeling.  You can't be going, hey, that was feelings.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you know, we do have a love songs channel here, too.  Oh, we do?  Channel 17.  Nothing but love songs.  And remember the other day I was mentioning about the double times?  Yes.  Wait, explain double times for Jim Norwood.  Well, double time.  You give the time digitally than normally, like 6.57, 3 till 7. 
[02:00:30]  So people who might not have a digital clock, they go, gee, three minutes before I have  to get out of the door.  But can't they figure it out with the 6.57 part?  What person doesn't understand that 6.57 means three of seven?  Like what person hears 6.57 and goes, oh, good, I got 25 minutes before seven.  Aren't they too dumb to count?  No, no.  It's because they're just coming out, you know, they're just waking up and they're kind of  groggy around the house.  You want to make it very easy for the listener, right?  You got to make it easy.  Keep it simple, Stanley.  There you go, yeah.  I learned about spoon feet.  Keep it simple, Stanley. 
[02:01:00]  I always heard keep it simple, stupid, but Stanley's nicer.  No.  And the most important thing is watch your levels stay out of the red.  You know, don't keep things all.  Oh, we're in the red constantly.  There's just a lot.  Like, never count the music.  Like, say, here's the first of four in a row.  Why not?  No.  Well, because then people go, okay, so then three more songs are going to hit commercials.  But here we could say something cool like, we're in the middle of a zillion in a row because  we never play commercials.  We just keep it going.  That is cool.  The music never stops.  It's true.  That's one of the things.  And the entertainment never starts. 
[02:01:30]  I love this.  And this is probably very important.  Please treat all equipment, buttons, and switches with respect as if you own them.  The finest gear in the world can be turned into junk if it's physically abused.  So, we've had a few coffee mishaps on the studio.  Oh, that's probably the biggest.  That's probably the most common.  You've got to put a sign on the studio, no food and drink in the studio.  Including the hosts?  Well, yeah.  I mean, come on.  In your commercial break, you could step outside the studio and sip a little water or something.  But that goes against your other rule.  Never step outside the studio.  If you have to go to the bathroom, though.  Right.  If you have to go to the bathroom or something to drink. 
[02:02:00]  But what about food?  Just keep it away from the microphone.  All right?  Keep it away from the controls there.  Yeah, the controls.  You don't want to spill anything on there.  That's probably the number one thing that happens to equipment is things get spilt on it.  Right.  But there's a lot of different things to do.  You know, during a shift change in the studio, hello is just about all that's necessary.  Like, hey, I have to say hello.  You don't have to talk about other things with fellow air talent, especially stuff behind the scenes.  Oh, you don't like a good crossover?  Well, it's a good crossover if you're talking about something going on at the station.  You know, hey, what'd you do this weekend?  That's not really important to the listener. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  Yeah, a person thought they know anything about the personalities.  Yeah.  Shouldn't they know a little more about the personality?  Well, you have to watch that because you can't...  Cousin Brucey's been on the radio for 50 years and no one knows anything about him.  Yeah.  He's your cousin.  That's all you need to know.  That's all you need to know?  We've been doing it wrong all these years.  We have been.  Fuck.  And again, if you have any questions about this, the programming director's office is always hoping to be fully discussed.  Oh, great.  Wouldn't that be a treat to go walking in there to discuss things?  Like, do you guys get off the air and have a little morning show meeting? 
[02:03:00]  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  From this floor to the lobby.  Exactly.  So then your fucking fingers meet the elevator button.  So then you put together all your prep stuff for tomorrow's show.  Say, hey, we're going to be talking about this.  We're going to be talking about what happened on Dancing with the Stars last night so we could review on...  Oh, so you have a little meeting.  You meet.  You prepare so much, but you can only talk at, you know, 15 seconds at a time.  It's always good to have more stuff than not enough stuff, right?  Even if you have a whole bunch of stuff. 
[02:03:30]  I remember a good buddy of mine, Ross Britton.  You remember Ross?  I remember Ross Britton.  Yes.  Good-diss jockey.  And he was into the show prep thing years ago.  He would have, like, 40 pages of stuff.  40 pages?  And only use two or three pages.  Then why have the other 38?  Why not knock it down to 20 pages?  Well, because it's good to know.  Say you're playing In the Midnight Hour by the wicked one, Mr. Wilson Pickett.  You look down on your sheet and you say, gee, he was born back on this date in 1941.  All right, why don't we do a little something with that?  Let's hear a little something.  Oh, we've got Casey in the Sunshine Band, too.  Do we have Casey?  Yeah, we'll do Casey first. 
[02:04:00]  Let's hear a little Casey.  You got it, Sam.  He's going to play it.  All right.  Shake, shake, shake your booty.  No, we got...  Oh, we're going to get down tonight.  Oh, boy, I tell you, it sounded so good.  Blasting out of your radio back in 1975 didn't get any better than this.  These guys came out of Hialeah, Florida.  Right now in Florida, got the Ultra Music Festival going on.  You can check that out on SiriusXM Channel 52.  But right now, it's Casey.  Oh, yeah.  Woo!  Fuck.  Do you have a full-time shift here? 
[02:04:30]  No, I'm just on standby.  So I've been keeping a lot of things ready.  How is this guy not on the air?  Why are you just on standby?  Because I'm doing programming work, doing a lot of things.  You know, there's a lot more than what comes out of the speakers here.  Do you do any shifts?  Yeah, sometimes I fill in on the 60s, fill in on the 50s or something.  I would love to hear that.  If they need me, I'm here.  I want to fucking hear that.  I want to know when you're going to be on air, because I will listen to that program.  I like the Decades channels.  I'd like to listen to a little 60s, 70s hosted by you. 
[02:05:00]  It would be great.  It's all about having fun.  Yeah.  It's all about having fun.  I enjoy coming to work every day and, you know, mixing in with a lot of you broadcasters  and stuff, fellow broadcasters.  A lot of great legends at work here at SiriusX Center.  I'm just happy to be a part of it.  Fantastic.  Wow.  I really am.  Okay, if I move this microphone up a little.  Oh.  I heard that.  Breaking all the rules.  We kind of heard that.  And these headphones are nice.  I have the Koss Pro 44 A's, the green ones.  Did you ever see those?  No.  I don't know what that is.  The professional disc jockey headphones.  I'm going to bring those in.  He knows all the headphones. 
[02:05:30]  Those are professional disc jockeys.  Are those the best headphones to use?  Cousin Bruce, he used them for years.  Yeah.  Once I saw him wearing those, I said, hey.  Is he your idol?  Bruce, yeah.  Bruce, a lot of great disc jockeys on the country.  Bruce, he is.  Late Robert W. Morgan worked out in Los Angeles.  Rick Shaw down in Miami.  Rick Shaw?  Yeah, a lot of great disc jockeys.  Philadelphia had a lot of great jockeys.  Let's back up here.  Hi, Luke.  Rick Shaw.  Did he work with Tractor Trailer?  Rick Shaw?  Tractor Trailer?  That's awful.  That's a terrible name. 
[02:06:00]  I think that's true.  A lot of radio stations years ago would have a jingle package of Stan Holiday.  And if Stan left, the next disc jockey came in, he would get that jingle.  Really?  He would have to be Stan Holiday.  He'd have to be Stan Holiday.  Or they would just cut it up so they wouldn't have to redo the jingle package.  Have to buy another jingle or something.  That would suck.  You have no idea.  No, like one radio station would always give guys the same names, like Jim James.  So it's easier for people to remember their names, too.  What about a name like Chuck Roast? 
[02:06:30]  That would be a funny name.  That's a funny name.  Who would laugh at that?  I'm just curious.  I think people, uh, simple people would probably laugh at it.  Simple people would be called it.  Like, what's wrong with just a regular name?  Oh, I think Rick Shaw is a good name, though.  I mean, it could be his real name.  Yes, if you're fucking Chinese and you have a fucking taxi.  It could be S-H-A-W.  Well, of course.  No, I believe it was.  But it's supposed to be catchy.  Yeah, and it was.  But it's not, though.  Why wouldn't you use his name, whatever his name was, you know, Rick Humberkunt, whatever his real name was.  Why wouldn't they just use their real name? 
[02:07:00]  Because it's not memorable.  Yeah, it's gotta be.  Brucey, that's memorable.  Yeah, cousin Brucey.  Rick Hunderhunt.  You want to do that other talk up there?  We got a little Wilson Pickett.  I had a question.  Do you have a shift today?  No, I don't.  What's all the prep for?  Just in case.  Just in case I get the call, I'm ready.  Yeah, I go through all the prep service.  The only guy on the port set taking Viagra just hoping the actor doesn't show up.  I love this guy.  He's well prepared, dude.  And the chance of you doing a show today is pretty much nil.  Well, you gotta be ready.  You gotta be in the bullpen.  You never know when you're gonna be able to throw. 
[02:07:30]  So, they might need you in the eighth inning there to come in and get that lefty out,  and you're a specialist.  Imagine.  When was the last time you got the call?  Last week or so.  Last week or so.  Yeah, last week, I believe it was.  Last week.  So, you're just what?  On the 60s channel.  You were just out there?  Or were you home or something?  I was at my desk.  You were at your desk.  And what did they say?  And what did they say?  Who came up to you?  The program director, Lou Simon, of the 60s channel.  Say, hey, could you fill in at 12 o'clock today?  And you said?  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  And you had your prep and everything? 
[02:08:00]  I got my prep.  Yeah, I went on the internet and took care of things.  Actually, you know, on the iPad in the morning, I look over things that I want to maybe talk  about, keep a note there.  Uh-huh.  So, it's very easy.  You know, you can't be a lazy disc jockey anymore.  You have to have, you know, you have to know what's going on.  You have to be in tune about what's happening, you know, with everything.  Pop culture, the news.  I like learning things along with the listener.  Yeah, it's kind of fun.  Right.  That's my strong suit.  Just kind of learning.  We get to be surprised, too.  Right.  How about that Wilson Pickett? 
[02:08:30]  We got that ready?  Oh, sure.  Let's do this.  Sirius XM playing a great one.  I tell you, he's a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer.  We called him the wicked one.  Wilson Pickett.  You can catch his music on Soul Town, Channel 49.  He was born back on this date in 1941.  Holy shit.  He got the 1941.  I'm going away.  Right there.  It's a fucking, it's an amazing talent.  Do you think that ruins the song when people talk over the music?  Oh, no.  I think it's part of the fabric of the format. 
[02:09:00]  People enjoy that.  I mean, if you're on an album, Rock Station Classic Rock, you're not going to be talking up.  You don't.  You leave the intros alone.  Yeah.  Hold these not so much.  No, because it's part of the format.  It's like when you go to, you know, for ice cream and you want sprinkles, that's part  of the, you expect sprinkles on there.  That is a good point.  I think it's part of the jingles.  That is a good point.  Who are you on the New York radio message board?  No, I just, I read that thing and I chuckle because those guys on there make you chuckle. 
[02:09:30]  They know everything about broadcasting.  Oh, don't they?  They've never been in the game, but it is amazing.  It is amazing.  You've got to love them.  The original name of that message board was Monday Morning Quarterbacking Douches, but  that was already taken.  I love it.  I love the professionalism.  He's got a clipboard.  He's well prepared for a show he'll never do today.  For a show that he'll never do today. 
[02:10:00]  Always carry a clipboard.  I've got to get my clipboard.  Do you know something, by the way?  If you walk around here with a clipboard, people are absolutely going to think you do  something.  Right.  They're not going to question it.  Why would you walk around with a clipboard if you're not doing something that needs a  clipboard?  It's the McDonald's philosophy.  Yeah.  It's like always, even if there's nobody in the restaurant, keep wiping down the counter.  Always be cleaning, right?  Always, yeah.  Just keep wiping.  ABC.  ABC.  Always be cleaning.  That's right.  I used to enjoy sweeping up the parking lot when I worked in McDonald's because I'd 
[02:10:30]  put the radio on and I'd listen at night to the radio.  I'd go out there and, you know, back then when I used to smoke, I would have a cigarette  and the general manager came out.  He goes, you know, if you want to smoke, punch out and go home and listen to the radio.  So I did.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Like a real Scarface Manny Quick moment.  I thought I'd get calls from like Burger King or something or Hardee's.  Uh-huh.  I figured I was zany, but I never got a call.  No, huh?  Never got the call.  You know what's amazing about doing the prep, even though you don't, all this prep  is topical, so he can't even hold it until he has a shirt. 
[02:11:00]  Right, right.  That's what I'm saying.  Exactly.  So all this goes in the garbage and he starts fresh tomorrow.  No, you can always work it back in because, say, you don't have a Wilson Pickett song  on today's playlist.  Hey, he was born back on this day, 1941.  We celebrated his birthday yesterday.  Well, how did you change?  Oh, I said yesterday.  You just got to keep these things in mind.  Like we missed, on Friday, we missed Ides of March.  We could have played Vehicle.  Why don't we play it now?  Let's see how this would have worked.  And a good bit that I wrote up about that.  All right, hold on.  Let's get to Sorrow First.  Do we have the song Ides of March? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, wow, he's fast in there.  Now, you might remember this song on American Idol when Bo Bice sang it.  A whole new generation have discovered it.  1970, it's the original from the Ides of March.  Drive away, baby.  Wow.  See, and you just hit a ramp there.  Or you could say, here's Vehicle.  Right.  You decided to hit a...  Okay.  So songs have more than one ramp sometimes.  Oh, yeah.  And some people just want to sing along with it, you know, tap on the dish.  But I practice a lot in the car.  Do you?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What's your favorite song to introduce? 
[02:12:00]  Like Bob Shepard of the Yankees said that his favorite name ever to introduce was Mickey  Mantle.  He just liked saying Mickey Mantle.  Mickey Mantle.  What is your favorite song?  Wow.  That's real tough because there's so many great...  I love playing Moonlight Feels Right by Starbuck, 1976.  Great summertime song.  Moonlight.  Diddly, diddly, diddly, wah, wah.  Very few songs have a xylophone in it.  That has a xylophone.  There's a reason for that.  That's a great one.  A xylophone.  That's a great one.  You know, staying alive because you're just pumping the energy.  You know, you close your eyes and you're just feeling that guy strutting down 86th Street 
[02:12:30]  in Brooklyn.  Exactly.  Or Andy Ginn.  There's just so many.  He's grabbing his chest.  Hey, could you play Staying Alive?  I don't want to hear him introduce that.  Oh, it was right around this time of the year, 1977, when a music came out.  And you said, hey, what is this song from?  It's from a brand new movie called Saturday Night Fever, The Brothers Skib.  They're going to be struck with Staying Alive.  Oh, man.  Oh, man. 
[02:13:00]  That's incredible.  Yeah, well, it was kind of interesting because back then when you heard How Deep Is Your Love,  you said, gee, is this a new song by the Bee Gees?  Where is it coming from?  And then the song would be in that movie, Saturday Night Fever.  Well, it was a huge soundtrack, that one.  One of the biggest soundtracks of all time, right?  Right.  And, you know, we play a lot of that great, all that great disco classics on the Studio  54 channel, Sirius XM 15.  Why wouldn't they make that channel 54?  That's what I thought he was going to say.  Oh, that was easy.  What's on 54?  I don't know. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, it must not be a music channel.  You can't switch that?  That seems like a logical thing to do.  Well, these things are for people higher than my...  You can't have Studio 54.  It's higher than his pay grade.  He's such a good soldier.  I know.  He's just like, ah, it's higher than my pay grade.  But you can't have Studio 54 on top of 15.  15?  I've seen you at that desk so many times.  I had no idea that every minute you're just fighting being fired.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm joking with him.  I see him every day.  Do you program the music? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  I program the music for the 50s, 60s, help out on the 80s channel.  What's the most important about, let's say, an hour block of music?  What's most important getting in there?  What do you want to do with that hour?  Well, you want to make sure everything flows properly.  You don't want to have too many slow songs back to back.  You don't want to have too many R&B songs.  You don't want to have two instrumentals within the hour or something.  So you want to have a good flow so people get a good representation of the 50s.  You're playing some Rock and Roll Hall of Famers.  You're playing some one-hit wonders. 
[02:14:30]  You're playing some early surf music.  Just a little bit of everything.  A good cross-representation of the decade.  See, you don't just pick songs and just pop them in willy-nilly.  Do you know how fucking revolted he would be by the way I do my Boneyard show?  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Oh, what you hate.  But that's the difference.  You walk around with a clipboard, don't you, Jimmy?  I do.  Is there a Boneyard prep?  No, I just draw, like, giant tits and hairy pussies on it, and I show people.  Willie's Roadhouse is on 54?  No, this is the closest thing. 
[02:15:00]  We don't even have a Channel 54.  Can't they just make 54?  That's why he said, I don't know.  But it's like, what's on 54?  It's like, I don't know.  Right.  Because there is no 54.  But on Channel 56, Willie's Roadhouse?  Yeah.  You know who Charlie Pride is?  Of course.  Of course.  Do you mention in your intro how he always says his K's like this?  He's tall.  He's 75 years young today.  I don't want to say young.  75 years young.  Oh, you're one of those guys.  Yeah.  That's nice.  People feel young.  That's nice.  And you can hear a lot of Charlie's music on that channel. 
[02:15:30]  Oh.  On Willie's Roadhouse.  Like, Kiss an Angel, Good Morning.  You know what's that?  Tall.  Is anybody going to San Antone?  Here's a company, man, but the company doesn't give a fuck about it.  I know.  I know.  I know.  He should be like CEO.  He should be the CEO.  The C-E-fucking-O.  You should be upstairs, Dennis.  Could you play his Charlie Pride song?  What's the one I want to hear?  Oh, how they love to tall.  Tall.  I got a question for Dennis as he finds that song.  Does it make you mad when they just give radio shows to guys that have never done radio? 
[02:16:00]  No, because those are guys who bring a lot to the table.  It's always positive.  It's like the color analyst.  You know, the play-by-play guy.  We call him Frank.  I don't like two play-by-play guys in the booth.  I like a play-by-play guy and a color guy so he can analyze what's going on.  You know, when I played with the Indians back in 87, we had a left hand.  So you're okay that Eminem gets paid millions and he doesn't even have to show up?  Well, we have his name.  We have his authenticity to the channel. 
[02:16:30]  And he brings a lot to the table.  I think Eminem does a credible job here.  More crickets, huh?  Have you seen him here a lot?  Yeah, all the time.  We go to lunch.  He's lying.  Not really.  It bothers you, doesn't it?  No, it doesn't bother me.  Hey, it's their company.  Did you have any mobile DJ gigs this past weekend?  Not this weekend, but I've got one on Thursday night.  Yeah, what do you got?  I've got a dance for the United Cerebral Palsy people. 
[02:17:00]  Nice people.  I do a lot of big dances.  You're going to see some unusual dancing.  I do a lot of good things for them.  That's good.  People like to have a good time.  I added Long Island Post.  It used to be CW Post.  They don't call it CW Post.  They don't call it LI Post.  LI University.  That's crazy.  I'm trying to make it sound like something it isn't.  I'll get out there and we have some fun.  So you should be booked every weekend.  Why aren't you booked every weekend?  I got a job this weekend.  I got one Saturday, too.  I got a birthday party.  I believe it's a christening.  He spins.  Oh, you do DJ work?  Yeah.  So I actually picked up some new hula hoops this weekend.  You know?  Got to bring some hula hoops out for the kids. 
[02:17:30]  Re-tape the limbo pole.  Sure.  Re-tape the limbo pole.  Yeah, well, I got a nice, like a big long dowel, like a big rod that you would have in  the closet.  I painted it, you know, and I put tape on it and sparkles and everything.  He takes his limbo pole seriously.  So I bring the limbo pole out there.  Just drag some pieces to bring the limbo pole out.  Yeah, and you get two kids, usually some older kids, some teenagers who are, you know, kind  of hip for the room and they don't want to do it.  They help out.  Say, all right, I need you two guys to help me out with the limbo pole.  And they hold the limbo pole.  And we get, you know, whoever's birthday is to, you know, lead the line. 
[02:18:00]  Uh-huh.  Limbo, limbo, and you do that.  Keep the limbo going.  What other activities do you do at some of these?  Musical chairs is always a big hit.  Oh, yeah.  How old are the kids that play musical chairs?  Communion age, younger, 12 years old.  We could do adult ones, too.  Adult ones are fine at block parties.  Oh, really?  Do you ever play musical chairs and there's one person in a wheelchair and they just  have to kind of sit there while everybody runs around them and they win every time?  We always make sure the kids are winners.  That's the thing.  Everybody gets a prize.  How do you do that?  When you get knocked out, you come over and see me and I give you a pair of, like, psychedelic 
[02:18:30]  glasses or something.  You know, so everybody feels good.  How many?  I can't tell you how great.  Or Hawaiian lace.  I call them tropical necklaces, though.  I don't call them Hawaiian lace.  How many times have you thought about swallowing a shotgun?  I just enjoy having fun with the kids.  You don't call it lay.  You don't call it a tropical necklace.  It's a tropical necklace.  We're giving out a tropical necklace as we play Kokomo in the background.  I would be out of my mind. 
[02:19:00]  I would just contemplate suicide every day.  I love this lifestyle.  God, God bless you, Dennis.  I'm having fun.  Dennis Falcone.  That's the website again.  We got to make sure you're booked all summer long.  We're trying.  DennisFalcone.com.  I appreciate it, though.  Got a couple of guys gave me a couple of hits over the weekend.  Said they enjoyed me on the show.  That was very nice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I just picture so many bodies in his crawl space.  Yeah, he's sitting there with a bunch of cadavers just fucking hitting the post. 
[02:19:30]  He's such a nice guy and just so positive about everything.  I really enjoy that because it's so rare around this building.  What else is on your prep sheet for today considering you're never going to do it?  Maybe we'll use some.  You should just do it here.  We mentioned that Donna Summer received three consecutive albums,  and she got the Walk of Fame back on this day in 1992.  How's she doing?  Not too well, but we do have her memories.  How about a little?  But we do have her memories.  We do have the music.  Right.  Last dance. 
[02:20:00]  Last dance.  Time to wrap things up.  We hope everybody then had themselves a great time celebrating today.  Happy birthday again to Opie celebrating his birthday today.  Let's have a nice round of applause for our guest of honor.  We make sure everybody, well, just like giving us.  Oh, I thought was that my actual birthday.  We make sure you guys get home safe.  We'll see you again real soon.  If you'd like to have me entertaining your party,  make sure you check me out, DennisFalcone.com.  Let's take it back in time.  The movie TGIF.  Thank God it's Donna Summer.  And last dance.  Take care, everybody.  Get home safe.  Get home safe. 
[02:20:30]  I love them.  You know, and if it's a Friday night.  I just want to hug them.  And if it's a Friday night party, hey, have a great weekend.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Saturday, hey, enjoy your Sunday.  Uh-huh.  And if it's Sunday, have a great weekend.  What a positive guy.  Everything is so positive.  I'm mad.  Do you ever have any negativity in your life?  Well, sometimes when I can't get the people up on the dance floor.  Well, that would get you a little missed.  Because sometimes.  Because you feel like you're doing something wrong, right?  I do a lot of jobs for volunteer fire departments. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Around the country.  Those bums.  God bless those guys who go out there at 3 o'clock in the morning if the phone rings  and they've got to be there.  Oh, yeah.  So when they, you know, all of a sudden you see a table of 25 guys, you've got to go,  I don't think these guys are going to be dancing.  Right.  Right.  So you just play what they want.  Hey, you got any Thorogood?  So you play George Thorogood.  Uh-huh.  Play any Boneyard music or something like that.  Sure, sure.  Try to entertain, play to the crowd.  So even if I have to be a human jukebox, just play to the crowd.  Do you believe in the devil's music?  No.  I don't like to play any devil's music at parties. 
[02:21:30]  No.  No, huh?  No.  Well, there was a good disco song called The Devil's Gun by CJ and Company.  That's a good song.  Did you hit the post on Hell Awaits by Slayer?  No, I'm not too familiar with that song.  That's what you should do.  Make him hit the post on some evil songs.  Yeah, let's get some Slayer.  I want to see if he can hit.  Hey, wait, Doug.  Let's get Evil by Merciful Fate.  I want to see if he can hit the post on that.  What's the ramp time of that?  I don't know.  Because he doesn't know the song.  I don't know the song.  But I do have other work to do.  He'll be able to hit everyone.  Oh, you're trying to get out of here?  He does have other work to do.  Look, he doesn't want to deal with devil's music. 
[02:22:00]  Well, no, the thing is, you see, that goes back to something when we were talking about  the manual here.  Oh, yes.  I would have to listen to that song ahead of time in the production stage.  Right, right.  So I would know.  Because I worked at a country radio station years ago, and I wasn't as familiar with the  music.  So I'd get in about an hour before time before I was on the air.  Oh, my God.  And I'd look at the playlist and say, gee, I'm playing this new song by Tim McGraw.  And I'd listen to it, and I'd see that it has a nine-second ramp time, and what's the  song about?  So I didn't go into it.  Because you're the voice of authority on the radio.  You never want to say, gee, I don't know this song. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  I say nothing but I don't know.  Yeah, but that would be fun to listen to.  Yeah.  Because it would be different.  Well, because, again, if you're the voice of authority of the country music station, you  say, oh, boy, we got a brand new one by Tim McGraw.  Tim's going out on tour next week.  You can catch him over on Polestar.com.  Find out if he's going to be in your neck of the woods.  You just always know what's going on.  Because a person tunes in the radio, and they want to hear somebody, a voice of authority.  Sure, sure.  Someone that's going to guide them.  From now on, you've just elected your voice of authority on this radio program.  Oh, wow.  That's right. 
[02:23:00]  Who is it going to be?  It's going to be me.  Jim Norton?  That's right.  Oh, talk.  Can we?  Ant Labrador.  I think we want him to talk up some evil shit.  Yeah, play on Evil by Merciful Fate.  It's a 30-second intro.  It's a 30-second intro.  What's this song about, Jimmy?  I really don't know.  Good gush.  I could read the phone book.  I was born in a cemetery.  It's about a guy who was born in a cemetery, and he violates a girl in her grave.  You got that, Dennis?  Yeah.  But talk it up like it's an oldies favorite. 
[02:23:30]  And what's this song called?  He's talking about how he'll dig up a girl's body and make love to shame.  Like, he'll have sex with this girl's body and kind of humiliate her body after she's dead.  It's called Evil.  And the song is called Evil?  Yeah.  By Merciful Fate.  Right.  Merciful Fate.  It's off an album called Melissa.  Melissa.  Like the Allman Brothers.  Sweet Melissa.  Well, it's a little different than that song.  And you play this on Boneyard?  I play it on Boneyard.  I play it in my house. 
[02:24:00]  I play it while I'm making love.  Oh.  What would be the channel number for Boneyard?  So I'll give you a cross-promotion.  You got me by the short and curly.  You don't know.  No!  Why would I?  I just say the Aussie's Boneyard.  That is so funny.  We have no idea what channel.  I'm on the Boneyard every night.  I have no clue.  My Boneyard is.  I finally know we're on 105 and 206.  I think we are.  Oh, the longest time I got confused by that.  Channel 38?  No, Aussie's Boneyard.  Yeah.  No, I've got to give the full name of the channel.  All right.  It's Aussie's Boneyard.  And make believe this is just a classic oldie song, okay?  Oh, yeah.  I want the same delivery, please.  All right.  You ready? 
[02:24:30]  Go ahead.  Hit it.  Well, good morning.  I know it's tough getting up on a Monday morning and getting things off to work, getting  the kids into the car.  But I tell you, I've got something that's really going to get your blood pumping.  It's a great song.  I love these guys.  I hung out with them last summer.  It's Merciful Faith and Evil.  Matter of fact, my buddy Jim Norton plays this for you on Boneyard.  You can check that out on Sirius XM Channel 38.  I heard right to that guitar there.  See that?  Right, right, right, right.  That's a ramp right there.  Yeah, so I really could, you know.  You hit one of the ramps.  I hit one of the ramps there.  But you didn't talk about the grave and all that. 
[02:25:00]  No, that's not my shtick.  That's not his shtick.  That's not my shtick.  It's like I wouldn't expect Jimmy to perform at a communion birthday.  Right.  That's not his shtick.  That was my pants on.  Yeah, that's not his shtick.  You know what?  You have to know your strengths and you have to know your weaknesses.  Well, that's pretty good.  What if a particular radio show, we only have weaknesses?  What if we have one giant weakness?  That's the beauty of it all.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Dennis, we've seen you around here for years.  Just barely said hi to you.  Talked to Little Islanders. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, Little Yankees.  And then you became a star this past Friday on the Tequila and Donut Show that E-Rock brought  to the table.  E-Rock was a little mean to you, though.  I didn't care for that.  Yeah, I didn't like that at all.  I was a little mean-spirited.  No.  To be fair, Dennis was also calling E-Rock.  He wasn't calling him E-Rock.  Who were you calling him?  They called him Slabo.  Oh.  Was it because of his weight?  I understand.  Well, his whole, you know, he's got to come a little nicer dressed here in the office  because, I mean, he's not only in the studio with you gentlemen in the morning, he's also  out there mingling, you know, so people walk around, they want to see somebody a bit more 
[02:26:00]  representative of this program.  Yeah, he's basically a slovenly pig, you're saying.  You know, back in the golden age of broadcasting, broadcasters wore shirt and ties to the radio  station.  Oh.  That was nice.  You look up a picture of William B. Williams, the legendary disc jockey who worked at  WNDW.  Let's see a picture of Willie B.  Willie B. Williams.  He was a shirt and tie.  Shirt and tie.  He was in for about 25 years or so.  Oh, God.  He was there for a long time.  Oh.  He used to play a lot of Frank Sinatra music.  He just, you know, he's just a very suave, debonair-looking guy.  Yeah.  That's just from another...  Yeah, there he is.  Willie B.  They used to wear suits to baseball games, too. 
[02:26:30]  There he is.  They're all with Lynch Blacks.  They all have the Beatles look.  He used to wear suits to Broadway shows.  Yeah.  Just going out.  People used to wear a suit and tie or...  On airplanes.  On airplanes.  Yeah.  It was very nice, too.  That was very nice.  Did they really?  Yeah.  We'll get dressed up to go on a plane.  Flight 800 wrecked that.  Yes.  Those good ties ruined.  Your shift is over, so why don't you intro the last song of your shift and get the hell  out of here.  All right.  Why don't we have something?  Hey, how about by Irene Cara?  She is 54 years young today.  Wow.  Irene Cara.  Yeah.  A little fame, maybe? 
[02:27:00]  Yes.  Some fame.  How many...  Wait.  How...  Can I ask you a question?  How...  Can you...  Can you teach me to hit the post?  Because I kind of admire what this guy...  Oh.  I don't know.  How long is the fucking ramp on this where I would need to talk?  Fame.  About 20 seconds or so.  Is it?  Whatever.  Yeah.  You just feel it.  Well, I'm not good at feeling it.  Again, that would go back to listening to it before you actually...  Again.  Okay.  Can I practice a few times in the car?  Can I try it once and then you do it?  Because you'll do it better than I will.  Oh.  Everybody does their own thing. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Let Jimmy do it first.  I have fame.  Irene Cara.  It's a birthday.  So you look a little something up about her, right?  Birthday.  54 today.  All right.  She's in the movie Fame.  She also sang the song from that.  Jimmy knows who Irene Cara is.  Yeah, I think Flashdance.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  This is one by Irene Cara.  You might remember her from Fame while she was crying with her ugly tits out.  The guy told her to suck her thumb.  Remember that?  And Bruno wanted to really fuck her and he never got to it. 
[02:28:00]  Then she was in DC Cab.  She got picked up by Charlie Burnett.  He died of AIDS in real life.  It's kind of sad.  Here it is.  Oh, you hit a ramp, though.  This is the wrong version.  No, this is the wrong version.  That's okay, but you did hit the ramp.  It's the wrong version.  She should have started singing.  You're exactly right.  He had it.  He sure did.  Old fucking candy corn tits.  Played the wrong version, Travis.  It's the wrong version.  I was ramping up.  The one that was on the Fame soundtrack. 
[02:28:30]  I was ramping up old candy corn tits.  You want the other one?  Yeah, let Dennis, your shift is over.  You're out of here.  Here's your last song.  Mention her candy corn tits.  Yeah, can you mention that at least?  No.  We'll see if we can work that in because I've got some other stuff to mention.  All right.  All right.  He's not going to touch that.  Sirius XM, I tell you, I've had a blast reliving the past for you today as we reach  back in time.  But, of course, if you're into the movie Dancing with the Stars, the TV show Dancing with  the Stars, I should say, season 16 is ever covered. 
[02:29:00]  It's live radio.  You can recover.  Season 16.  Can you believe that?  Season 16 tonight.  Check it out.  In the meantime, and in between time, let's go back to 1979 with Irene Cara and Fame.  Jesus.  That's live radio.  You can recover.  You did recover.  You recovered well.  And another thing about recovering, never say, excuse me.  Oh.  Calls attention that you made a mistake.  Who cares, though?  Just go on.  I love it.  It's such great advice.  It really is. 
[02:29:30]  I love it.  We can learn something from Dennis Falcone.  Well, thanks.  It's been a pleasure.  I notice you smile when you talk.  Yeah.  Because I'm happy.  No, but I mean that projects a happy voice.  Well, that's like when you do a live promotion, a broadcast, right?  I'm sure when you guys are out on location, you're there smiling at people.  Yes, as we're getting into the van to go home, being rid of these fucking mules.  You guys have to spin.  If you spin the wheel of prizes, people have a good time.  You know why I smile during a live event?  When I can hear Opie and Anthony in the next room on the air, and I'm getting jerked off 
[02:30:00]  in a bathroom.  That's when I'm smiling.  Dennis, comment?  It never happened to me at a live promotion.  That's because I was giving away t-shirts and koozies.  Right, right.  Thank you, Dennis.  Take care.  I wanted to shut my mic off.  I just don't want to take the headphones off.  Oh, well, you know.  It's fine.  It's okay.  Yeah.  We got to get that button.  I got the feedback.  You all right?  We're leaving the studio.  The on-air light's still on.  Take care, guys.  I've had a blast reliving the past.  Thank you.  A blast reliving the past.  Dennis Falcone. 
[02:30:30]  Thank you, Dennis.  They should be paying him way more than whatever he makes.  Oh, my God.  All right.  To be fair, Iraq, ask him if he smelled my gassers.  Uh-oh.  Someone fucking dropped like eight gassers that whole time.  He's too much of a professional.  Ask Dennis if he farted.  He'll probably go, no, I smelled it.  Yeah.  He's a pro.  He is a treasure around here.  And I'm sure they don't even know his name and just treat him like a shit.  They don't give a shit that he's here. 
[02:31:00]  Unbelievable.  He used to be the overnight dude.  Like, not like on the air overnight.  Like, he used to have to come in at like four o'clock in the morning.  Really?  After all these years of broadcasting?  Yeah.  I remember seeing him when I'd come in the door.  He'd be sitting at that little desk next to the door.  He got here before us.  And he was here before us.  Yeah, yeah.  Iraq?  Comment?  Comment?  There he is.  Did he smell Jimmy's farts?  Not at all.  Not at all.  All right.  We got James Lipton coming in today.

[02:42:30]  tourney don't watch it's kind of exciting any college basketball i don't watch any basketball  even the tournament though is pretty exciting i don't think so i think you get into it a little  bit i don't think so not so much so much well we do have a guy he created a car that's uh possibly  fueled by air this will think he's a dead man oh god this one will never see the the light of day  they make these type of people go away quickly yeah let's not forget about water car a water car guy  is one of our most famous examples yes he didn't feel well after he ate at a restaurant and died 
[02:43:00]  a food poisoning or something or something similar to that certainly did very suspicious and that was  right after not not soon after not not too much uh whatever the fuck i'm fucking tired  i was wondering when you were gonna spit that out i was trying uh yeah he died he fucking yeah he died  after he announced the whole um water car water car thing and this guy you don't even need water 
[02:43:30]  just there holy shit this guy is a dead man everyone looking to save some money on gas and  so when we heard of the car that runs on air we just had to send our correspondent to check it out  abc's nick schiffrin tonight running on empty  it may seem hard to believe but this rust bucket could be the car of the future it'll never be the  car of the future listen to it big oil will never allow this to happen what the hell it's running on 
[02:44:00]  air are you kidding me what do they separate the hydrogen out and um that whole thing probably  that's what they do car of the future so when i look in here i see a garbage can that's great yeah i see  a piece of wood that i see some random string i mean this is totally homemade right it is yes  oops meet inventor peter dierman his car needs no gas no batteries only air 
[02:44:30]  what emissions will this car produce uh it won't actually use any emissions because it's only air  that we're using we're not burning anything here's how it works when you cool air to minus 300 degrees  it becomes a liquid if you want the liquid with the help of antifreeze it expands back into a gas  powering the car's motor  so fancy a spin  range is three miles with a tailwind top speed's only 30 
[02:45:00]  look it's an early prototype but soon there'll be a more polished package  developed by the company designs engines for mclarence sports cars  in 40 years of inventions in this garage peter says this one is his most important  he may just make the old gas guzzlers disappear into thin air  nick schifford abc news hartfordshire england he's a dead man  oh no he's so dead i mean but he has it figured out 
[02:45:30]  oh just you you would think companies would jump on this but there's  there's no way this will ever see see uh the light of day holy shit but he figured it out  like you saw the car it's going 30 miles an hour on air  oh blimey someone's left a cake for me out front  oh this is delicious  that's scary shit you will never hear about this car  what's this fluid underneath me car 
[02:46:00]  oh it's probably nothing  oh yeah that poor bastard  what what is that's a weird thing though because how the fuck what kind of energy does it take to  to get um air oxygen to that cold it's a liquid form you got to think of the energy that it takes to do that  right you know it's like people with their fucking electric cars  oh it's great yeah but you know you're plugging it into a wall and that electricity has to come from somewhere and it's coming from the power plant that's powered by coal or oil or nuclear or something right yeah less pollution though less pollution yes in uh on the roads and they're not the other power plant 
[02:46:30]  they allowed the electric cars yeah they allowed those yeah they did big oil will decide what they'll  because again they're not gonna allow these type of cars in general because some type of oil  power plant is right so powering right so charge them didn't hurt their business too much no but something 
[02:47:00]  like this would really hurt their business oh yeah gotta think they got hit man oh yeah gotta think they  have them out there who's that in the bushes  you think you'll put a positive spin on it at first yeah yeah maybe they come to see my call  oh did they yeah where's lipton he's uh we have them close to 9 30 by the way i heard a little story 
[02:47:30]  you know uh we do that that uh old-timey actor voice right right uh apparently it's called  the mid-atlantic voice okay and it's a thing that was taught years ago right so you don't sound like  you're from any place in particular oh you can sound like it's sort of from england and america  at the same time but why did it matter uh because it was like sounding professional

[02:55:00]  pull up a seat here we go sir please feel free to uh pull up a seat and um what do we got there  got the water a little microphone my goodness we were just commenting we're on the air by the way we just  wing it like this uh if you feel yeah you don't have to if you don't want to as long as you could 
[02:55:30]  hear us that's fine we don't we don't mind uh well obviously uh we were astounded by the list of people  you have interviewed um it's it's quite extensive and uh an amazing array of celebrities uh when did you  when did you start uh interviewing people uh in this in this fashion 19 years ago that's it in 1994 
[02:56:00]  when the earth was covered in mists uh i had an idea as a member of the actors studio that we ought to  uh create a degree granting program for the first time in the history of the studio which was then 47  years old and you know the people that had given us from james dean and paul newman and and uh marlon  brando and so forth right up through pacino and through uh de niro and jack nicholson etc and and and  and i suggested at that time that we the studio first of all was a very private place it was a gymnasium 
[02:56:30]  and uh nobody was uh was allowed in from the outside it was a place where people could go and  what make mistakes why because you'll learn from your mistakes right but you don't want to make  them in public once you're famous so that's that's how it worked i said why don't we create a degree  granting program for the first time we don't have to let people in the studio is still on 44th street  it's still a private cranky place where nobody can get in but let's let this method that has been 
[02:57:00]  honed all these years out in a in an educational uh environment and that was how we started actor  studio drama school which is now at pace university uh and when we started the actor studio drama  school i had uh i had people who would all of our core courses by the way are taught by life members  of the actors studio that way we get the continuity that we wanted and uh so we had people who teach 
[02:57:30]  30 weeks people would come in and do six fridays in a workshop but there was one category left  that was unfilled and that was those people who are members of the studio or friends of ours or  colleagues with whom we've worked who could only give us one one night of their lives so i sent a  letter out and said will you come and teach our students for one night paul newman answered dennis  hopper answered sally field answered i got these extraordinary people saying yes we'll do it and that's 
[02:58:00]  when i sent word back into the professional community i was by now dean of the active studio  drama school which i had i had created it so they made me they said well you'll give it a year start  start it you know how long you've been at the studio by this time had you been there since the  beginning only two years i've been there by then uh i was trained by stella adler and harold clerman and  so um we uh i i i got these responses and i sent word back into the professional community from which i had 
[02:58:30]  come and i said look these people are liable to say something worth preserving and uh anybody interested  because that means television cameras and bravo took the existential leap with me at that time bravo  had 20 million people that is to say and cable vision they were owned by cable vision there were 20  million subscribers today we are in 94 million homes on bravo we are in 125 countries we have a record  breaking 15 emmy nominations and if you would put a gun to my head in 1994 and said predict that or die 
[02:59:00]  i would have said pull the trigger can i ask when you do us such an amazing prep for these interviews  do you do publicists give you the same thing they give us well you can't ask about this you can't  ask what are the parameters you allow we are about to do our 250th episode wow not one publicist has  ever told me i can or cannot do anything not one there is no pre-interview on our show we're the only  talk show of our kind that has no pre-interview that's why i have to work for two weeks to do 
[02:59:30]  those three or four hundred cards all by myself and and the and the the result of that has been  that the the guest walks in and has absolutely no idea what's coming next that's the rigid rule on our  show and nobody has ever asked to violate it i'm amazed by that that level of trust for you it's  trust and well they know that we're going to talk about craft we don't we're not interested in gossip 
[03:00:00]  right we're a master's degree program those are master's degree candidates sitting out there at pace  university and so uh they know that we're not going to get into gossip we don't care about it we really  don't care seriously and what do we care about we care about the work they've done and if i were to  ask you or you or any of anybody in this room look i'm going to interview you and what we'll talk  about i'm just going to ask you about those turning points in your life that made you whoever the hell  you are now both as a as an artist in our case of our show and as a person and you start and i and i 
[03:00:30]  i've done my research and i know that there was a turning point something somebody died therefore this  and so i asked them i described to me what happened and then they they tell me what happened  and in doing so what happens it's it's called effective memory in the stanislavski system what  happens is the emotions that they felt at the time begin to come back and as a result we became to my  absolute astonishment the most intimate and the most emotional show of our kind who gave you the most 
[03:01:00]  emotional interview that you can think of or one that was yeah look when i was asked over and over  again over the years who's the guest you want the most i said look i was for 10 years the dean of the  actor's studio drama school i was his founding dean i'm no longer it's dean i'm dean emeritus and i and i i  said the night that one of my graduated students has achieved so much that he or she walks out on that 
[03:01:30]  stage and sits down in that chair next to me is going to be the night i've waited for since we  started this program and bradley cooper graduated in 2000 we trained him for three years and when bradley  walked out on that stage he looked at me and i looked at him we burst into tears and we had this  wow we couldn't go on with the show for a bit until both of us had recovered so uh there is that kind of  emotional attachment uh in the show that again doesn't make us better i hope it doesn't make us worse 
[03:02:00]  but it sure as hell makes us different yeah and it's uh it's honest i mean obviously not talking  about uh the gossipy end of it just the the craft uh and and just open honesty about i think people  feel safe there too it doesn't feel like they're going to be blindsided by some tmz uh reporter no  because that's look we're a master's class class in university we don't care about those things  our students don't care they would be disappointed in me if i asked a question about 
[03:02:30]  right nothing to do with with the reason that we're all there and uh the result for us for our  students remember they come from 100 we're in 125 countries that's not a joke we were immense in france  in in in japan in australia in the scandinavian countries in latin america the show is just huge  and uh the uh the result is that our students come to us from all all over the world and they  come to us for a reason and the guests know that there's a reason and therefore the guests have a 
[03:03:00]  reason for coming there which is to teach them and it turned out i thought it would be so dull i  thought it'd be so dry i'm serious i thought we wouldn't last a year here we are 19 years the  second longest running show in the history of cable television all of these things it sounds like i'm  bragging i maybe i am but it's also the truth and uh and it's not something that i had anticipated  or even planned it just evolved organically the way an acting role is supposed to yeah how did you um 
[03:03:30]  accept uh being thrust into pop culture like that i mean the parodies that have uh been done about you  which are hilarious i i i it appears that i it it appears that i am a figure in pop culture sure  watch arrested development when it comes back on the air netflix i'm back on the show  the warden gentles but the character that i created on the original show i'm back on on the air the uh 
[03:04:00]  the will ferrell of course yeah we all know about that and it is it's not something that i can plan  but it is something that to be perfectly frank that i treasure yeah i mean will's a friend that he  asked me to be in in his in his movie with him which i did and uh and the uh this thing has evolved  too over the years this this uh this relationship do i like it people ask me do you hate it hate it 
[03:04:30]  uh-huh i would i would crawl on broken glass to have this kind of thing happen to me it must have  been odd though to be the dean of of a university it's all happening at once i was one of seven  deans in a university which is an academic position of course and at the same time all this madness was  happening yeah what a you that's an amazing story of all the people you've talked to what was uh 
[03:05:00]  uh something that shocked you like what's a piece of information somebody most shocking one i think  well brace yourselves it's quite a tale it's brief jack lemon was on i'd known jack lemon when i was a  young actor and came to new york and he was already a famous actor and um jack was you may know an  absolutely elegant human being and it was near the end of his life just a few months the end of his life  and he was on the show and because i'm dean of the school i'm always trying to make a point for the 
[03:05:30]  actors i'm didactic which is one of the things people make fun of me for and some people dislike  me for they think it makes me pompous and um but i'm always trying to teach them something and so i was  here i was working with jack and we were talking about days of wine and roses and i said to him you know  uh the uh the all the famous scenes in it the scene next to the crib with the child the scene in the 
[03:06:00]  in the greenhouse when you smash it trying to find a bottle that you can't you you stowed there  the scene when you're arrested all those huge scenes emotional scenes but the most moving the most  thrilling scene in the movie is the quietest when you stand up in front of the of a.a. for the first time  and say those historic words and then i paused i'm always trying to get my guest i tried to get  de niro to say you're talking to me wouldn't do it i did get uh tom hanks to say uh uh life is like 
[03:06:30]  a box of chocolate and i waited for him to say it and he's and he said it he said my name is he  couldn't recall and he said my name is so and so and i'm an alcoholic and i turned to the students and  i said see look no pushing no pushing no begging for anything just do it just do what the character  does and let the audience provide the emotion see no pushing i said that's acting and he said no it's 
[03:07:00]  not i'm an alcoholic oh wow wow and there follows a 15 second pause which i kept in the edit because i  edited the show and it's right there and we just stare at each other and i saw he didn't want to  go any further and oh wow to the next question but it was the most startling moment in the history of  the show and afterward his wife said to me in the green room first time jack's ever said that in 
[03:07:30]  public wow so the fact that he said that i guess obviously meant he was in recovery and had kept  that private wow that's yeah he was yeah but he had never admitted to it in in public in his life  until that moment would you call that a surprise yeah yeah well not in this studio i wouldn't  come on i enjoy a couple of beers myself but you're an interesting guy too in that you like  how much of this is folklore but back in france when you were a younger guy you you know what what is 
[03:08:00]  this oh god are you going there we have to ask yeah you were ahead you were uh you were i don't  want to say a pimp per se but i was a mech macro uh which is not which is not strictly speaking a pimp  um uh a pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him and generally speaking that  relationship nowadays it's unthinkable unthinkable i'm talking about when i was a youngster this is long  long ago where it was all regulated in france and so forth but in a pimp exploits the women off and 
[03:08:30]  often treats them horribly we know that but a macro works for the women they employ him and i was  living in i was living in paris i had no i couldn't get a work permit it was out of the question in  those days were you acting there that are you there i had gone to i was i had been acting in greece in  a film and then i came back and i didn't want to come back to the united states for a while i wanted to 
[03:09:00]  live in europe and i particularly wanted to live in paris this expression in french called french  called rite de passage rites of passage uh i was going through it and i wanted to continue to go  through it and i had met by chance because i had gone as as americans did in those days to the rupi gal  to see a sex exhibition which was in those days was commonplace in paris  and in america didn't exist at all and uh afterward i had had a drink in the bar in the bordello 
[03:09:30]  and met the young woman who had participated in this and we became friends  she was from can she was beautiful young can was and in those days uh the was the france was going  through a very hard time and the men couldn't get work and certainly the women couldn't and there was no  opprobrium associated with uh uh women who went into what is called them what was called the milieu 
[03:10:00]  which is that world uh and then came out of it no the names i could name for you movie stars and so  forth in france who were in it for a time and there was nothing there were students who were in it who  were earning their way through school women who were supporting their husbands who were going to college  for example uh they were it was a entirely different world and completely regulated medically regulated  and everything anyway uh then when i ran out of money she suggested that i would become her mech  so that i could stay there and we could continue our friendship and our relationship and i did and 
[03:10:30]  it was the most one of the most interesting years of my life now you know the whole story wow but it  what is the one of the responsibilities of uh i would i would go to the i would in the morning  i would appear at american express which is where all the tourists turned up especially the american  tourists uh right next to the uh to the palais garnier uh and uh to the paris opera and uh other people 
[03:11:00]  would be there saying would you like i i conduct tours would you like to see chartre would you like to  see notre dame de paris etc all these people would be these tour guides i was a tour guide i would  say you want to see some sex and uh these americans startled americans would say yes this is really  what they came to paris for in those days and uh then when was this when was this roughly 1950s  and uh so you know france is still recovering from the second world war and uh and the um 
[03:11:30]  um then they i would have to go with them because they were nervous they were frightened about it so  i would take them there to the bordello and and my girlfriend and another woman or a man or whatever  it was we had arranged that this thing would occur and uh uh they were these people were electrified by  and they would ask me to translate for them and speak to these people and tell them what they wanted  to see and so forth um so it was a very strange time in my life but it was it was literally the 
[03:12:00]  only way i could remain in france i couldn't earn a living any other way i would gladly have done  something else now that's probably a much more fun way to make a living yeah well did you get involved  interesting were you a part of what do you mean by get involved well you know i mean what i would love to  have done no no i mean she was my girlfriend for christ's sake yeah yeah i wasn't gonna you know betray her  with even with her wow follow me it's very complicated you didn't get jealous no no no 
[03:12:30]  well she wasn't it was it was we were we were friends we were really friends more than anything  else right yeah and uh and she had arranged for this it had to be arranged for her they would have  found me floating in the sand because you couldn't you couldn't practice that profession uh unless you had  been endorsed okay and so i she got me endorsed wow what a great story i've never discussed this  with anybody else before on radio it's it's quite amazing uh part of of your history and just part of 
[03:13:00]  history i we'd never do that i never would i never would have uh discussed it at all i did in my memoir  inside inside yeah it's there in black and white for everybody to read but uh arthur lawrence the great  playwright playwright had been there and a whole with a whole group of people stella andrew who was  my acting teacher and they were all there in paris they came for the summer and i was there and that  was when i was working and they asked me to her and i took them all and arranged one for them this 
[03:13:30]  as a sex exhibition and and uh arthur wrote about it in his memoir oh really yeah six years ago just  before i wrote my my my memoir and uh he talked about it and he and um uh and so i felt it had  he had outed me did he drop your name in there drop my name i thought maybe it was an anonymous type  no he devoted a chapter he called me he called me the guy who hosts the actor's studio 
[03:14:00]  i wasn't that then he called me the sex guide wow and uh and so once that had been done  i had there was nothing i could do about it except own a memoir to put it on record truthfully  once and for all when judia roberts was on my show years ago and judia had played of course a  prostitute famously and uh i said do we interview prostitutes and so what she said yes and we got  into that and then i began to talk about i said well when i was in france i i and so forth and then 
[03:14:30]  i never realized i had trapped myself and that was long before i ever discussed it and i didn't want  to go any further with it and judia got she started laughing she couldn't stop laughing and it's one of  the most famous moments on the show where i was just sort of fumbling around and i didn't know  what to say or how to get out of it and julia could not stop trying to drink her water and  she let you off the hook or she probably could have pursued it oh she didn't but i didn't confess  anything right right it wasn't until arthur lawrence wrote about it as an experience of his life 
[03:15:00]  that i decided i'd better set the record straight such as it is it's an interesting story and you know  what it's so it it's it's in a time in history where it doesn't seem as seedy as anything like  that now listen the women who were in the media in those days were some of them were very very elegant  and uh and it was and as i say they were examined weekly by a doctor it was completely regulated 
[03:15:30]  some of the bordellos of that time were among the most famous in the history of the world these women  were like geishas and uh they were so royally treated uh and um uh and as they as i said women  moved in and out they needed the money they were desperate and so they would do this for a while then  would come out of it people would know that they were in it there's a very famous very very famous  french movie star who was in and out of that media i won't say what it was and uh that's not my right  and but i know she was and and uh when they when they when they came when they came when they came 
[03:16:00]  out of it there was no opprobrium whatsoever people never even gave it a thought wow the french have  always been look we're the united states of america we're uptight what tradition do we have that the  french do not have the puritan tradition there is a puritan tradition in america which we inherited  but the catholic countries of europe france and uh and italy and so forth do not have a puritan tradition  as a result they look neither does asia neither does japan for example and so in those countries 
[03:16:30]  you don't find the same kind of nervousness or obsession with sex they're much less ex actually  much less obsessed less uptight just less one of the problems with the catholic church today is that  it has become absolutely riveted on the subject of sex right yeah and i'm not criticizing them that's  their right but but it is a fact and uh and the um uh they are they are more sophisticated perhaps  about it or and certainly more casual about it they don't see it as a uh as as every encounter 
[03:17:00]  as a life-changing event sure i'm not saying that's right or wrong but it's it's different from our own  tradition we are more uh uptight and it has to do with our puritan tradition yeah absolutely i think it  takes away from some things that could be you know art i think it takes away from art in this country  a lot of japanese art the greatest japanese artist the the rembrandts and the davinci's 
[03:17:30]  of japan all painted pornography pure pure graphic pornography my wife is half japanese and half irish and  she studied art with a great japanese artist he was a national treasure they declare them national treasures  in japan and he gave her as a gift once this we it hangs in our house this painting by a  master of one of the 18th century masters of japanese painting and it is a pure pornographic 
[03:18:00]  and it has a a place in your home right there prominently displayed pride of place you see  wonderful i love it why not absolutely why not absolutely did you study with uh  did brando study with stella stella adler brander study with stella adler de neuro study with  stella adler harvey keitel studied with stella adler i studied with her for two and a half years  she taught for two years and actually i was uh she asked me to stay for another six months 
[03:18:30]  which i did and worked with her she was the greatest single academic influence on my life  did you so you knew brando yes i knew brando when he was when i first came to new york he was already  uh you know a star but he uh i didn't know him quite well you know i'm always fascinated with  people who got to know him because uh he seems like one of these guys that was rather difficult to  get to know like i at the end of his life i was always trying to get him to be inside the actor's  studio by then he was reclusive and he would sit up in his home and he and he would make phone calls 
[03:19:00]  he would call me and uh we would talk for 45 minutes but he would never appear on the show by then  he would not come out of his house and and uh he was very very very bizarre he speaks to me in  spanish and i said i don't speak spanish and then he would stop but we used to talk for a long time 
[03:19:30]  i said why don't we say this on the air for god right right and uh no but he wouldn't do it so he's  one that got away but he by then it wouldn't have been very valuable anyway because he had spit the  bit he was no longer interested in acting and he contemned it and he hated himself as we all know  uh it ended poorly yeah but when i first saw him when i first came to new york i saw him in streetcar  oh wow and uh he was the greatest actor i ever saw did he really dislike like guys like rod steiger 
[03:20:00]  because there's this famous story about when they were doing that that you know i could have been a  contender charlie that he wouldn't even do the lodge close-ups with him that he just he hated his  acting is that the truth i have no idea i don't know i don't answer that that i i don't know that he  did uh but certainly that scene is justly famous he did everything wrong in it uh he did everything  unpredictable and what instead of being angry at his brother instead of being frightened of his brother 
[03:20:30]  the two things that you would think that any actor would have chosen made made those choices in the  scene his brother was destroying him at that moment what was he instead he was heartbroken  he was heartbroken that his brother would do it was the most amazing choice and only a brando could have  made it i think that nothing nothing impresses me in an actor more than risk if an actor takes chances 
[03:21:00]  and is utterly unpredictable then i know i'm in the presence of a great actor and what there's one more  ingredient that's necessary if the actor first you you are absolutely startled by his choices or her choices  and in the end you realize they were what inevitable that's what makes a great great actor and that's  why brando to my taste is the greatest of his time and we kept we have some great ones going on now 
[03:21:30]  who do you think is unpredictable now like completely who's shot seymour hoffman yeah wow he is good  yeah that's a good one yeah did uh did brando ever talk about acting and and the actual craft of acting in  public in any way yeah he he um he decided after i started inside the actor studio i think he was inspired  by it he because he's a member of the actor studio he was so aware of it he decided he was going to teach 
[03:22:00]  a class in los angeles advertisements went out people walked um and uh they rushed to be taught by  marlon brando and they arrived at the appointed place and he was waited for the door to open for  him to come in he walked in a dress as i recall it lasted i think about 24 hours just he by then he was  two he hated acting he thought that acting was not was not a worthy profession and you know why 
[03:22:30]  because he was a genius geniuses make one mistake consistently they think that whatever they do is easy  why because it's easy for them and they didn't have to learn it because it came from instinctively and  as a result they think it's easy and it's easy for them to become contemptuous of it because look  i'm doing this thing what what's so special about what i'm doing why should anybody make a fuss and  eventually people like brando become contemptuous for example uh ted williams had to teach himself 
[03:23:00]  every moment of swinging a bat he could teach you how to swing a bat because he had had to teach  himself he wasn't a genius what he was was a great great great great student and he taught himself how  to do it willie mays never gave it a minute's thought in his life he was a genius it just  happened he would get up there he'd swing the bat and he'd hit a home run uh there are those two kinds  of those two approaches to a craft and and marlon was absolutely a genius he just was able to do it 
[03:23:30]  now he was well trained by stella adler he had a thorough training from her when you put together  technique with talent you can't teach talent tell us what you bring to the table and know what that's  like and exactly i said i wonder what that's like i'm sure you know but but uh you put together talent  and technique and then out comes a brand you know i can't even watch movies like a miracle on 34th 
[03:24:00]  street was on recently i just can't watch things from that era anymore because again like watching guys  like brando and like hoppin or whoever i can't watch the old school acting anymore it just seems so  disconnected to anything because it was english acting until the uh stanisovsky system took hold  in america through the group theater out of which came stella adler and lee strassberg and all the  teachers whom i have studied with um they until then it was a pale imitation of english theater they had a 
[03:24:30]  kind of false english accent yeah everything had to look good and they practiced in front of a mirror  until they had themselves just the way they wanted none of it was organic none of it was felt none of it  was emotional none of it was real it was all uh a system of of of posing of uh of it was rhetorical  uh it was uh it was essentially false very much like old stage acting that's what i'm talking about  yeah it was it was theater acting yeah they took it to film but then when the group when the when 
[03:25:00]  the moscow art theater on stanislavsky came here in the 1920s there was a revolution and uh that was  when uh strassberg and stella adler and herald clurman and cheryl crawford they saw what was happening  on that stage and they knew that the door had opened it would never close again and then they founded the  group theater out of that came the plays of odette's out of that came all of our greatest actors and today  it is uh it's transcendent in the world there is no actor who is not touched by it in one way or 
[03:25:30]  another and in america we've had some very very very great teachers the greatest whom i thought was  stella adler and uh and she did teach brando and once again there with me i brought a minimal talent  to it so i was okay but he brought this great talent put it together with her with her technique  and out came uh a very great actor this footage oh that same thing yeah unfortunately i should  ask one more question did they say this foot i'm not a fan of shakespeare i can't enjoy it but i 
[03:26:00]  watched brando doing like uh you know uh you know the season he was the mark anthony i think he was  doing and i and i couldn't take my eyes off it because it was like this is the only guy i've ever  seen do it neither could the english actors i remember once uh one of the english actors on my show  was it tony hopkins or john hurt i've forgotten which one it was ian mckellen they said to me look  at the julius caesar you'll see what brando was doing was he here we all came with this classical  training with the perfect body the perfect voice the perfect uh behavior and brando came on that screen 
[03:26:30]  and we were all of us in the shadow and uh yeah and he he was he was able to bring to it uh the kind of  of of of of deeply felt emotions of american training and acting uh when applied to shakespeare who was  the trick was a great writer of emotion a great writer of feeling a great writer of character 
[03:27:00]  and when you put those two together then you've got a performance like brando's but i mean others  do it very well i think tony hopkins is a perfect combination when he was on my show he told me  that while he was studying at the royal academy in london learning the kind of acting that we all  associate with um with shakespeare and with english tradition uh he was sneaking off and studying  stanislavski with an actor acting teacher in london and putting the two of them together and when you 
[03:27:30]  put that exterior technique which is external in which certain aspects of the character are acquired  externally together with a an internal technique that digs deep into your own soul and makes you  recreate whatever it was that shakespeare wrote and said uh organically from your own life experience and  from your own uh deepest deepest the marrow of your bones and you get the kind of exquisite acting 
[03:28:00]  that all of us can react to and never forget yeah wow so so rare to see they're telling us what  they're oh yeah yeah they're you're you have other prestige you're very busy today apparently uh james  is promoting of course inside the actor's studio it's it's an amazing show you get more out of actors  you watch tina fey which is tomorrow night on bravo and you we talked about what improvisation because 
[03:28:30]  she came from second city she gives a lesson in improvisation that is incomparable and guess what  we then improvised and i was allowed by her to interview sarah palin oh she does watch it yep she does  sarah we do about eight minutes together of sarah palin of her sarah palin and it is absolutely  extraordinary you know that it's improvisation it's totally improv we're both improvising 
[03:29:00]  tomorrow night that's uh eight o'clock on bravo it's season 19 and uh you just you're an amazing  interviewer and a great guest and uh you know yeah thanks so much what you get out of actors is amazing  no one gets that coming in stuff out of thank you fantastic thanks for coming in and i think a great  interviewer gets things out of people like you know some people got james to talk about things  that he hasn't talked about right my wife is if she hears this oh boy meanwhile you should have  maybe gotten an acting lesson from him instead of acting yeah i really should have i do things that 
[03:29:30]  are unpredictable too i forget the lines and when i do remember i suck jimmy has a problem he doesn't  know what to do with his hands to make them look natural as he's acting yes he's either by there or  fault hands are the problem look at you watch humphrey bogart bogart never figured out what  to do with his hands he usually tucks them into the belt of his pants really bogart couldn't even  figure it out he watch him he was never comfortable with his hands i find that like what i'll do is  i'll just talk i'll just put them over my head out of frame people just forget that that's why in the 
[03:30:00]  k mutiny he was doing that with the marbles but he just brought those one day it wasn't even part of  the uh script you're right he just started it's absolutely not true all right well let's get james  thank you james very much thank you all all right  and now the open anthony show continues this is after on a live here's your host sam roberts  have a good show sam have a wonderful day i'm out of here bye everybody bye sam i did my magic

[03:32:30]  he's doing the harlem shake in hospital is that what's going on he's like wait wait wait wait  because tmz tmz went out and said that uh first on saturday night they said he was dying  and then the bird man was like little wayne's not dying but what's crazy is uh we were actually  making fun of him on my show saturday you were and then uh bird well bird man manager called me  and bird man was driving to the hospital but they were they heard it on serious exam how we were  making fun of him so i had to do a little wayne shake it up set so i did all play all little wayne

[03:36:30]  and who knew that james lipton could get a job in acting and make a career in acting without ever  acting in anything yeah dude that's crazy he's the man you want this said larry you always call  you want this sudoku well the question i have about the sudoku is which one is it is it one of  the new york post is it the daily news it's the it's the daily news it's the daily news completed  signed and dated by greg ob hughes well um i gotta tell you it could become a very valuable family heirloom

[03:38:30]  just got to eat jelly donuts and you'll be fine eric was the star again i would say of today's show  just the fact if now i don't know it's either you or james lipton today just the recap friday's show  what was so good the today's show was a classic show just because of all the recapping that we did  eric do you did you black out from friday no i did not you didn't black out nope i could have sworn  when you were sitting there because i don't know if you heard about this who can friday at eric's choice 
[03:39:00]  became donut and tequila day what eric said i love tequila i'm gonna bring it in on friday and we're  going to do tequila day and i'm looking at him when he's telling me this earlier in the week going  like you're fucking nuts like why why are they healthy why why would anybody drink tequila at  seven o'clock in the morning but of course we all just looked at him and said all right dude go for  it he went for it and so he brought in the tequila and we made it our mission we went around the halls 
[03:39:30]  trying to find people who kid he did ten shots of patrone on the air what ten shots of patrone on the  air is there something we don't know eric how did it feel after after a few you don't even notice it  anymore well you couldn't have noticed it because dude he did three shots of water that we told him  were tequila after he had done the ten shots he thought it was tequila he didn't know like when did  you find out that you were doing shots of water well like i like i said earlier on the first shot of the 
[03:40:00]  other tequila it didn't have that like that kick that tequila has it seems so well you eric went  on the record of doing a shot of water shots and then he went like this he went smooth  fucking guy drinking water yeah and then um then anthony had taken the bottle at one point and down the  last half of it or probably three quarters and i still didn't notice i still didn't know at that 
[03:40:30]  point eric was sitting there in his drunkenness who kid anthony it's a bottle of water but it's in a  tequila bottle anthony does three quarters of it in one shot and eric's looking at him like he's the  fucking man and eric looks at anthony and in classic drunk guy moment he looks right at him and he goes  i want you to know i know that you don't like me get the work and we're all looking around like  what and then eric goes but that was fucking awesome that was beautiful a troop serum right there 
[03:41:00]  and then uh when the show was over the main show i see ant with his backpack getting ready to leave  him walking down the hallway and i'm like how did oh that was not tequila that's when i realized it  wasn't tequila but you were still loopy oh yeah how did it did it wear off like i don't by the  afternoon did you feel it wearing off yeah it was it was i would say i could feel that i still felt 
[03:41:30]  shitty but it wasn't fucking up like my coordination or anything no no headaches no nothing you didn't get  you didn't get a hangover after that no i was expecting it and i didn't get it i went to the bathroom  a lot but you know no headache no throwing up nothing did you ever have the tequila shits who  could uh yeah when i went to cancun that shit is rough eric talk about the tequila shits a little  bit yeah it was like four hours content yeah it's like constipation right not the liquid no no no it 
[03:42:00]  was like i said earlier you had a garden a hose and the nozzle on it and you don't have it on stream  you just set it to that spray it just shoots out oh i got constipated and so you had jelly donuts  and tequila just pouring out of your asshole oh yeah oh and the sandwich i had too oh of course  yeah because spicy right there because in an effort to sober up he ate a bunch of pizza and then had a  giant deli sandwich yeah and you didn't constipate no it all came out that's just as good as a workout 
[03:42:30]  right it counts as calories burned they're not in you anymore yeah i'll go with that it's the same deal  right yeah i had a body a brick in my ass you had a your your your your shit just tarred up inside  your intestines like i tried to eat a lot of uh i guess burritos and tacos when i was in cancun  during spring break and then because i drank mad tequila and i ate the worm and then all of a sudden  i you know i was scared so i ate mad burritos it was like a brick in my ass when you're in cancun i'm  surprised like even if you the ice in your drinks you can't trust because they don't make you 
[03:43:00]  shit all over the place it was the opposite though no i had a brick in my ass you you were  corked like you were in prison i had a brick in my ass serious what did the wife think of what went  down on the show eric your wife knew i gotta find out about this because we knew that his wife was  listening because at some point during the show eric's wife instagrammed a photo of the pad data that  said eric is drunk it said it right on the radio and eric was on the air and i'm telling like 
[03:43:30]  he's talking reckless like completely reckless yeah they didn't say that okay but you remember  nicole you've met nicole yeah i met her she's a very nice person she's in here and she's going uh  on the after show she's like oh my god eric is so lovable when he's drunk blah blah blah and eric  looks at me and he goes you know what sam and i go what and he goes right now i think i could get her  i go i go you could nicole and he goes i think i could 
[03:44:00]  and then nicole is sitting there and i'm asking her about the hangover and what's eric gonna feel  and nicole goes i gotta tell you this kid he is gonna take a nap and he's gonna wake up hung  and eric goes wake up hung and nicole goes yeah and eric goes more to bj's from nicole  do you remember what your logic was when you were saying that no i i think it was that i remember 
[03:44:30]  a story she talked about that she liked doing that to her husband and so you were thinking wow  we're all waking up when in rome hey you wake up you get a head by her damn she's a nice person too  guys but i don't know if you can if you can handle it when you're hung over from tequila shots she do  got a nice mouth though you've noticed that but the the problem is the ass have you noticed that  flat you like her ass i like flat asses it's totally you are a white guy aren't you because i like seeing  the butthole clear i hate when the butthole's hidden you know you don't like the the deep crevices i want to see 
[03:45:00]  the butthole and the pussy so i know it's there you want a woman to take her pants down and you  have a direct path to that butthole like i had a flat irish chick this weekend you like that red lawn  you don't like it because most of most black guys they like the big ass the cushy cheeks i'm not like  most man something something you can hit it from behind and bounce back i'm you yeah very strange  so what did the wife think of the whole uh the whole thing she she said it was fine what does that 
[03:45:30]  mean though she wasn't upset or anything she just was making sure that i was all right was she  humiliated no she was laughing at it she thought it was funny yeah because i was drunk right because i  was going to say like yeah you know some women could be humiliated by that but to me he came on this show  on friday and he was the man wow you know he was like you said talking reckless but he was the man  he was making people laugh like i wouldn't know are you human have you listened back uh just what i 
[03:46:00]  heard today and i have that was the first time i listened to it what's your what's your feeling  coming off of it how are you feeling over the weekend it's crazy how are you feeling today well  uh overall okay um i'm up until today i'm guessing the performance was was good there's nicole walking  by you don't want me to hook up one of those morning bjs for you nah i can't do that you could  have on friday so you're saying the performance was good yeah everything was good everyone see 
[03:46:30]  based on all the feedback i got all weekend everybody seemed to like the show and um yeah  there's a couple little uh difficult moments to listen to but uh what was difficult for you  actually just listening to it but there was a little rough was there any specific thing that  you said that you were like oh like when you when you looked at anthony and you said i know that you  don't like me is that one of those things you're like why would i say that no um i think it was when 
[03:47:00]  i would the uh the part where they said i was crying and i didn't realize i was crying yeah that that was  kind of like dude you're he's crying he started but it wasn't like come on it wasn't that it just was  happening physically i'm talking to them but it was no it was more it wasn't a happy cry it was  emotional because it wasn't just watery eyes and then the tears started going down his lip was  quivering yeah his the tears were coming down his cheeks and we go irak why are you crying and he  goes i didn't realize i was and then he told me do you remember telling me on the after show 
[03:47:30]  that the second time you knew you were crying and the reason that you were crying was because you  figured out that you were crying no but okay that was i'm sure i said that that was your logic to  me that you realized he was like crying like a bitch though he was just like emotional like then  i love this show i love anthony i want to sleep with opie like exactly that's exactly what was going  on no not at all but wait that wasn't it no not at all oh but he started he started going he 
[03:48:00]  started getting a quivery lip again and saying i'm sorry i fucked up the show i'm sorry i  i fucked up the show crying again you remember that was that embarrassing that you did that um  no it's not embarrassing because i think at the time i did believe that well it didn't last long  it lasted 30 seconds before you completely flipped they convinced me otherwise that i hadn't but it  was tearing though and i retracted my apology i knew that you were a hit because somebody tweeted 
[03:48:30]  me right after my sunday show he was like sam that was a terrible show actually i'm gonna retract what  i just said and go fuck myself because that's what he said okay he goes he rock goes like i'm  sorry for fucking up the show you didn't want a drinking show and opie and anthony are going and  me we're all going what are you talking about you rock like it was the best you you're doing a great  job and he goes you know what after being in radio for 19 years this is what people want to hear 
[03:49:00]  i'm gonna retract that apology and go fuck myself  i would have heard that i would have been dying where's troy bring troy in here it was the one  show that troy missed troy was out sick on friday unfortunately and like this was the one  overall i thought he told me it was in the elevator with his shirt off no that wasn't on friday that was  a couple weeks ago dude you missed the show of the year i know i heard it though it was great were  you happy eric that troy didn't get to enjoy that i no i knew i couldn't find him at first i didn't 
[03:49:30]  realize he was out and then i never thought about it for the rest of the show well you didn't think  about much did you you were feeling no pain i was feeling good you got to listen back to the to what  you said about sal you're sitting there and i was going eric sal is cheering for you and eric dude  troy did you hear it yeah yeah that was great eric starts pointing to the window that sal's by and he  goes nobody cares about him and just like announcing it for the world he was twisted huh yeah it was 
[03:50:00]  funny too man you really uh were you surprised were you surprised at how uh because did you hear that  eric was trying to organize tequila sunday yeah or tequila friday yeah and i was like ah like what is  what's he doing you know and i thought to myself he's not gonna really do it right and then i tuned in  i was sick i wasn't feeling when i woke up a little late and i tuned in it was fucking it was great it was  really funny did you think he would ever in your right mind would you ever think that eric would  sit there and voluntarily just do 10 shots no there's no way it's not him i don't know how 
[03:50:30]  he could do that that's crazy like eric do you do you have a do you drink a lot when you're not here  no not like um how do you say this without sounding like an alcoholic not like like every day you know  every night i need to go home to get something how often do you drink maybe the weekends so like  maybe once or twice a week if that yeah and how many drinks do you have not a whole lot because  you have a crazy tolerance for alcohol 10 shots he did hook it i was counting that's crazy he did 
[03:51:00]  10 legit shots the three shots of water made it 13 it was 10 tequila shots he's also got a lot of body  weight yeah that's well to absorb that i'm not trying to be mean i said that earlier it's probably  yeah but dude you could be obese and 10 shots is still gonna hit you i mean dude you have a lot of  you have a lot of fat in there he's not that fat is he is he 10 shots fat  between seven and ten in the morning that's that's pretty crazy it's and then to wake up with no 
[03:51:30]  hangover yeah that must have been a big ass sandwich you ate oh it was what kind of sandwich did you get  the roast beef or something it was uh well because we had mentioned it earlier i felt in the mood for  corned beef and pastrami i knew it it was a little mustard corned beef and pastrami  followed pizza so it was so this is what your stomach and you're wondering why you had to spend  four hours spraying all over your bathroom eric's stomach had 10 shots of tequila a giant corned beef and 
[03:52:00]  pastrami sandwich some jelly donuts and pizza straight commando right there wow yes yeah  did you think i'm talking about getting hit like the bj's yeah he just he's great he's like a  fucking pimp soon as he gets some alcohol he was a pimp wasn't he just he just had the  fucking sound like a a fucking uh cocaine dick yeah in his pants you know did you feel that way did you  feel like you had a nice little can of diet coke in your pants no i was feeling like well this isn't 
[03:52:30]  going to get any worse so let's just keep going with it it seemed like you were very confident is  that what happens when you drink you get confident maybe a little liquid courage yeah liquid courage  why not that's why people love alcohol man you go out to a bar and you just start kicking  bullshit to a bitch and you don't give a fuck so i'll tell you it's my dick yo yeah but you won't  even be drunk when you're saying that yeah i'll say a regular but you know he shocked me with that  shit i wish i would have heard it he did more than bj good and dennis was funny on the show too i 
[03:53:00]  can't believe that he was actually that funny dude do you know dennis he's the weirdo that sits by  the door oh yeah he's like an older guy and nobody really knows what he does glasses yeah it's a weird  guy he's been working in radio for like since what 79 so that's 70 89 and 30 years um more than 30  years he's like a radio junkie well i don't know how that guy after we've gotten to know him on the  air yeah like i want to give him my overnight shift on hits one how is he not a real jock here well 
[03:53:30]  it translates funny on the air but when you're just walking around or you're standing you're you  have your fucking dick in your hand at the urinal it's not that funny he does you guys got to  understand and troy's right that dennis character that's on the air that's him 24 hours a day and  it really comes across funny and and owen are feeding into him and it's and playing it up it's  hysterical but that dude you'll stand at the fucking urinal taking a leak and he'll look over 
[03:54:00]  like you know back when i was on wla and you're like dude i don't give a fuck yeah it gets you upset  i just get annoyed man you know because it's just like it's just one of those people that just  constantly has to talk and hear himself talk well he's a dj he's a dj troy right but they just don't  know when to shut it off and just be like a regular dude no while you're pissing though while i'm pissing  while i'm in the fucking kitchen while i'm doing anything that dude will just come on and be like  you know back when cousin brucey was bubble bubble i'd have to talk to you about radio and i'm like 
[03:54:30]  i don't give a shit about radio you know what happens when they shut it off  reality starts to kick in all right you heard this guy all right this is a guy  he's got a family he's been in the business for over 30 years and he's still doing  dj work not like club dj work but like what what is it called what what do you say like  sticky radio entertainment yeah no but what did he say he's dj in this weekend uh um the catholic deal  uh christening christening somebody's christening right no he's not yeah he's taking these gigs where 
[03:55:00]  he is christening he's playing musical chairs for kids at these dj gigs and he's been in the  business for 30 years what happens when you shut off the dj character is that you realize what's  going on you get mad you get you get angry yeah you get mad at everyone and everything so you can't  do it imagine being married to that dude we just need the radio guy doesn't ever get shut off he's  trying to end or being his kid like imagine if your dad is just every day trying to tell you about the 
[03:55:30]  old days of radio yeah the glory days like you're driving you're in high school and you got z100 on or  whatever and your dad is just in the front seat of the car going you know before it was z100 it was  but and he's just telling you exactly what i would tell my dad shut the up yeah but your  dad would turn around and be like shut up cutie yeah keep talking whatever sir whatever you say  but but he's just sitting there before elvis duran you know they were they they they he didn't do a  time check i know elvis duran is big but you should do a double time check because what it's going to 
[03:56:00]  do is they confuse the listener they want to know what time it is okay now imagine being a program  director here okay you're trying to run a channel or something and then this guy comes in knows  everything is correcting everything you're doing like you wonder why like you know there he is  walking up the hall you think that's what he does he goes in he's coming up here now he's correcting  program directors and yeah i'm sure he's probably has to let people know all of his knowledge in  radio well listen radio wizard you're doing something wrong here yeah this is the way it should be done 
[03:56:30]  this is the way we did it back in the day and blah blah blah blah so he's like a uzi like a you know  uzi mouth do you know who kid of course is my man is mike hot it is hot you got your own little  catchphrase huh it's already over i want it's called mobile dj work mobile dj parties yeah but that's  what happens right you turn off you turn off that inner dj and the anger is going to come out isn't it  it's no anger that's what i'm saying doing a party is it's fun i enjoy it it's not you know 
[03:57:00]  woo kid goes in does it it's a different thing everybody's different i get my dick sucked at the  end of the night do you get your dick sucked dennis when you do these parties you ever get your dick  i look forward to a tip at the end yeah just the tip i get it a lot he doesn't just put just a tip  one of these mothers of these like you're throwing a kid's birthday party and somebody's you know you  go to a single mom you're not looking around like hey how's this going to turn out tonight i just hope  the dance floor is packed right right right well what if she's looking down to make sure the dj's pants  are packed you know what i'm saying who knows i'm there in my tuxedo have a good time

[04:00:30]  i'm sitting there my aunt is getting on the dance floor and she's doing the macarena i told you i didn't  want this at my wedding you know what if she comes over and she wants to hear it i'll say you know  that young lady over there asked me to play the macarena and you'll say go ahead you know give her a  good time i go she's 70 years old denny don't call her don't call her young lady the cupid shuffle  the cupid shuffle what's the cubit shuffle that's another dance you know long lines of the cha-cha slide  you know the cupid shuffle where you go four steps to the right four steps to the left and walk it  down you know all around you know all these dances you got you gotta stay up on this stuff i feel like i'm 
[04:01:00]  looking you don't play you don't play niggas in paris do you play uh i played that i played that  a couple of times at a gig and words in paris announce the title though you won't no you could  offend people you got kids there usually kids are the ones that are asking for these records you  don't might ask for niggas in paris wow a little white guy did a little white kid ever come up to  you and ask you for that oh yeah they do it all the time you ever tell them do you do you pass judgment  on them or do you let that you know what you said you drop that m-bomb all you want as long as you're 
[04:01:30]  having a good time as long as you're having a good time that's all the dance floor is packed  big as in paris i see i heard you the first time okay i just want to make sure i told troy my wedding  dj would not play any songs of profanity he all i said you can't i said will you play the just no  radio edits and he goes no dude i'm playing the radio right yeah it's lame you have a mixed crowd  you have a mixed crowd if it's an after hours party say things are going crazy like nine o'clock  at night you're having an after hours party sure then it's after hours nine o'clock it could be  nine thirty yeah because like i have a four to eight this weekend okay so that's the party that's 
[04:02:00]  four to eight i'm hope when i go to nine o'clock right right that's the action you know hello t that's  time and a half there you go that's time and a half yeah he plays this yeah so how motherfuckers  don't find me no i know the words i know the words um but you know what at the end of the day that dj  was right because i'm looking around the room we got you know my wife's bosses are there my family  for who's who's you know people of all ages are there they don't want to hear em bombs being  dropped no no that's not the place there's a time and place for you're out of here who kid 
[04:02:30]  i i feel like i'm i'm i'm seeing generations of dj's here daddy this is a hot mic so i want to take  the cans off good good good thank you for taking care of my studio it's do you have any you know  troy is a dj i do i do but he's one of these young dj's everybody's got his own style yeah yeah that's  so you're all about that you're not about people being better than each other you're about people  being themselves gotta be yourself community right it's a community of dj's it's a community of dj's  yeah what do you think would you ever think about maybe morphing more towards denny's style 
[04:03:00]  it's a little more welcoming a little more broad but he does clubs and he does you know a lot of  underground places and things like that it's it's different i couldn't do that you couldn't i  couldn't succeed to what he does but i understand what he said when you get a lot of pleasure out of  djing when you do something you like and you're you're in the spot that you want to be in  it is very pleasurable and when you're sitting there and you're you're doing what you do and  people are having a good time that's what you get out of it right yeah sure yeah there's people  going off have you know basically it's like the whole party revolves around you like if you drop 
[04:03:30]  that volume the party's over and you're right dennis because if you go to troy's place and you're  playing you know cha-cha slide everybody's looking at you like who invited this guy you have to know  too but at the same time be able to read the crowd if troy shows up at a communion and he's doing all  these you know techno mixes that these kids are into they don't know that they're looking at him  like what are you playing don't work you got to know your audience don't you right you got to go  for what i call the scream like all of a sudden if you throw on suit and tie by uh timberlake and 
[04:04:00]  jay-z and people love that song they go everybody screams you know you hit a you hit a nerve right  there so that's one of those crossovers you'll play that you'll play that sure you'll play suit and  tie how do you keep up danny on what's going on how do you how do you keep up on what's not music  service and they tell you and you know yeah you have to you have to stay involved you have to read  the charts you have to uh read the prep sheets you know know what's going on well yeah do you have  any more prep for i was thinking i would like to do it do you think kid kelly will let me give you  my overnight hits one slot no that's your thing yeah but i think it's i think it's highway robbery 
[04:04:30]  that i have that goofy slot and you're sitting there looking for uh somebody to get sick or something  you're trying to knock out somebody's kneecaps to get on the air no that's okay i'm i'm happy doing  what i'm doing waiting to get the call on one of the classic channels one of the decade channels have you  ever seen the movie beyond the mat uh i think so it's a wrestling documentary okay and there's a a  guy who used to wrestle hasn't wrestled in a long time and he's sitting there and he's got a little  trampoline in his backyard he's a lot of shape but he's got two little dumbbells in his hand and he's  jumping up and down on this mini trampoline and he tells he says to the camera you know what i haven't 
[04:05:00]  been booked in about 12 years but you got to stay in shape because you never know what your next match  is going to be i did see that reminded me of you today when you were like you got to prep every day  because you never know never know when you get the call you remember that part eric yes very much  and they're going denny why aren't you on the air today and then he goes i wasn't booked you didn't  book me you gotta book me he was out on the trampoline yeah i'm out on the trail i'm in shape but you  got to book me staying up on the ones and twos um let's go to zach in kentucky what's up zach hey 
[04:05:30]  sam how you doing buddy um i believe we should have and i don't know what dj's would call their  competition but uh a dj off between uh just troy and jimmy and dj who kid on the after show maybe  they both could are all three could play like two songs kind of hear their styles and have call-in  voting or something you know it's not a bad idea if you could kind of maybe on a on a friday show  if we get some some equipment up here and have everybody just give a little taste of what it is 
[04:06:00]  that they do and i don't want you guys kind of you know like i each of you just do what you do  and we'll see the differences yeah that's different styles is that something you do denny  sure would you come in here and get the party started on the after show one day yeah we try  that yeah why not that could be fun a little crazy that could be fun uh mike in philly yo guys how you  doing i was going to come up with that exact idea it's all good i did both styles i did an after  hours club in philly for around seven years i would do weddings all during the you know on a 
[04:06:30]  saturday bring my stuff back the one from one in the morning till six or better i'm all in you're  all in i would love to do it i've been out of it now for about two years and you miss it i'm in  once it's in your blood denny you're dead on all is accurate i dropped an f-bomb one time at a party  and i got you with it because i did after hours and i could do whatever i wanted and it was an 
[04:07:00]  accident and the guy nobody was dancing and i should get on the f-bomb dance floor and a guy  you just cursed and i'm like holy shit how fast did i do this danny i said no i didn't let you get  your chucks on the dance floor your chuck towels your own sneaker right right because you know what we  don't point out our mistakes we go forward good recovery then you deserve i'm telling you man you got  to get one of the hits jack i listen to the 70s i'm 45 i love the 70s my dad was a dj in the 50s 
[04:07:30]  used to spin without without they didn't have mixed board they're two all right is it impolite to hang  up on people sometimes you got to sometimes she's got to you know put them out of their misery got  like five minutes left to show right here to talk forever and take them behind the barn and just  shotgun them he's a dj he is he's in the brotherhood he is it's i i i feel like i gotta try i didn't realize  the djing could bring this much joy because i'm envious of the happiness that is your life i feel  like you know i'm searching for the anger a lot easier to be a dj too these days why do you say 
[04:08:00]  that a laptop and then download music but doesn't that make you upset aren't you sitting there going  like these kids have it too easy you can't you can't complain like that my god you just what are  you gonna do you gonna sit back and complain oh these guys and then you're gonna sit home back in  the day there's only a couple records now i mean a song comes out on a tuesday if you don't have  it by wednesday people are looking at you like why aren't you playing this right so it's you  you really have to stay up on everything like i got spotify i got everything yeah you need to  have everything at your fingertips right well i've been in the business so i'm able to get the music 
[04:08:30]  i know you know the connections and i get things sent to me and i and you know it works yeah you  know it doesn't work yeah when you hear a hit somebody's pushing this out even now are you like  do you know when it's going to work you can tell if it's a good song sure you can people on the  dance floor do your kids like that uh that you stay kind of up to date with the music oh yeah  because my dad has no idea what's going on i mean my son calls me up he said hey could you get me  tickets for swedish house mafia i said what are you crazy really those tickets yeah see my dad  isn't my dad would think swedish house mafia was like a european goodfellas movie or something he 
[04:09:00]  has no clue that this is a popular group yeah i mean i'm a guy i'm in my 50s and most guys say i  don't know how you do that how do you stay up with the music why not you know you're gonna sound old  then they said that in 1958 you know when chuck berry and elvis was around are you still playing  gangnam style yeah you gotta stop still works at the parties you know why because moms like that  yeah right because it's on the mom tip now moms like that song the moms have become aware of it  you can't play that in the club hell no when you did for a while well you you when a song comes out 
[04:09:30]  it's it's like that where it's popular and it's like a like a youtube thing you can drop it for like  a week or two and then you start seeing seeing people turn on you and you're like well i'm gonna bail out  of this one and then you're like that's never getting played again get on it early and get  off it early right where are we at with harlem shake uh it's still good but that's like that's  on the tail end maybe maybe this week another another week or two and that's done and then  it goes over to danny's world well i'll be playing it you know playing it at sweet 16s playing it at uh 
[04:10:00]  you know parties right people like the song yeah yeah and i but but sweet 16s these songs can last a  little longer yeah you'll probably play it into the summertime yeah yeah i kind of wish that song you  know what happened like in may and then you'd have it through the summer right and i also play  snooty clubs where you know if it's oh well it has to be something that nobody knows about and then  everybody knows about it's like this is shit and it's manhattan so it's like if you're not on top of  shit it's you know everybody just needs to be the coolest person in the room exactly and the dj  is your job yeah so if you're not cool you're not having a party goodbye and you have a long 
[04:10:30]  night too do you start like 10 o'clock at night go to maybe four in the morning two sometimes four yeah  yeah jesus christ it's a long night you're oh you're done at 10. it's a long night well yeah  but it's a different you know it's a different thing people are coming there for four hours  right walking in for cocktail hour right then you're opening up to the buffet so maybe they  have an hour and a half two hours of dancing he's got to work from you know keep keep moving the  whole seven hours and not repeat a song you like your you like you like how you your your your niche 
[04:11:00]  you like that i like doing it sure good i love it that's the key secret to life isn't it can't stand  there when you know and look a little sour puss on your face right you gotta like what you do  for instance like e-rock even today e-rock is happier at work today from being fucked up on friday i think  this is gonna be a whole new thing because i think he he gained a lot of respect from his co-workers  and he let loose he let loose a lot e-rock do you feel more respected today uh i think for today yes  you do i respect you a lot more today than i did on thursday for instance because i called you an 
[04:11:30]  asshole i love that did you hear me cackling yeah i did did you hear that yeah when i go who's who  fucks you the most and he goes you and i go why am i so bad and he said because you're because you're  an asshole yeah there you go that's what i've been looking for would you love to really tap into that  anger though oh my god i was trying yeah i was working on it all right we gotta go real quick  i promote something real quick yeah uh at 675 bar this friday djing and then i'm at uh building uh 24 in  redding pennsylvania this saturday plus the nice part about denny's gigs are he doesn't have to
