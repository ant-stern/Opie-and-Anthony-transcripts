<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed their annual "Homeless Shopping Spree," beginning with discussions about a New York City transit strike causing traffic delays and a humorous anecdote from Opie about an aggressive driver.  The hosts then announced their plans, revealing they’d selected ten "despicable" and "stinky" homeless individuals for the event, acknowledging the resulting strong odor affecting studio staff, particularly highlighting Big Kev's surprising lack of smell amidst the stench.  Pre-departure updates from Ben, who was loading the "stinky" group—including individuals nicknamed "Golden Buns," "Gray Wolf," and the erratic "Santa"—onto a luxury bus, were interspersed with listener calls offering traffic updates and suggesting meeting points at the Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack for the "Pests" (listeners) and the "ONA Army."

The journey to the mall was chronicled through chaotic calls from the bus, describing the driver's poor navigation and increasingly erratic behavior of the homeless passengers.  Listeners at the mall attempted to coordinate a meeting point, finally settling on the Ferris wheel.  Further calls provided updates on the passengers’ shopping plans and their behavior. This segment included pre-recorded comedic skits by "Tippi Tom," a drunk and smelly individual who performed poorly sung cover songs.  Studio guest Bill Burr’s presence was marked by an awkward moment when another guest, Francine, inadvertently mentioned the Dave Chappelle Show, a forbidden topic, resulting in repeated apologies.

Live reports from Ben on the bus, No Filter Paul, and Jim at the mall, along with numerous listener calls, detailed the shopping spree at the Palisades Center Mall.  The reports included police stopping the bus (for unspecified reasons), descriptions of the homeless individuals' behavior inside the mall (crude humor and references to public masturbation and bodily functions were frequent), and their shopping choices (or lack thereof) in various stores including Abercrombie & Fitch, a mattress store, a music store, Old Navy, Stephen Barry's, a Native American store ("Native Spirit"), Hot Topic, Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, and Modell's.  Notable incidents included Gray Wolf attempting to remove a saddle from a carousel horse, Tippi Tom humping the horse, a homeless individual refusing to buy anything until receiving underwear, a woman's awkward experience paying with an American Express gift card, a haggling incident at Foot Locker, discussions about a homeless man's "rust-colored" feet and lack of a back on his underwear, Gray Wolf performing a song in a music store, and a store alarm triggered by a homeless man.

The broadcast extensively covered the group's subsequent visit to a mall bar, with numerous listener calls adding to the chaos.  The segment also featured extended discussion about a staff member (E-Rock) getting left behind at the mall, causing amusement.  Vulgar language and crude humor were prevalent throughout.  Listener calls offered diverse anecdotes and reactions, interspersed with jokes and opinions.  A planned future "betting show" was mentioned.  The broadcast concluded with a humorous, off-key rendition of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" by some participants.  Finally, the show included a segment focusing on the hosts' experimentation with webcams, remotely accessing listeners' cameras and setting one up in their studio, leading to humorous observations and sexually explicit commentary regarding a woman's breasts displayed on a webcam feed. The show ended with thanks to participants in previous "homeless shopping sprees" and the show's staff.

[00:07:00]  one of my fellow uh new yorkers more stench to have to deal with in the fucking cab more stench  other people's yuck oh and the cab drivers they said they were talking to cab drivers there's so  much going on with this strike they talked to five cab drivers yeah four of them out of five  had no clue what their contingency plan was as far as the strike goes they divvied up the the whole  city into sections uh zones zones and in order to drive in or cross over into a different zone 
[00:07:30]  cost a certain amount of money like a flat fare it's supposed to be faster that way you could load  more people in the into the cab uh and drop them off at different locations without having a meter  for each person right so uh and four out of the five savages savages that drive the cabs had no clue  that this was even going on uh the roads coming in i had a little bit of fun today on the on the way 
[00:08:00]  in i i left about one o'clock um i knew it was going to be a disaster it's a 20 minute ride by the way  20 minute ride usually i knew it was going to be a disaster took me about an hour and 15 minutes  most of which was spent in queens plaza and getting over the queensborough bridge because i  didn't want to deal with the midtown tunnel and the drive uh uptown so uh i'm driving and i'm on 57th  street which is two lanes and uh there's a a car with two uh two uh let's say attractive girls in 
[00:08:30]  there and they pull up next to me and ask me to roll the window down so uh i roll the window down  i say yes and they go how do you get to central park i guess they're kind of new in the city and  stuff i tell them just go up to like sixth avenue make a right blah blah and you'll get there sure  so as i'm telling him this and dude it was that fast it was as fast as i just told you behind the  girls there's maybe a car length or two in front of the girls at this point so the girls take off 
[00:09:00]  we get stopped at a light now this woman is right next to me line of cars i can't even stress to you  how much traffic is on 57th you're not really moving any great distance at any one time your  car length the car length the light the cop stops you know the car length light turns green waves  you on it's very slow like you're just crawling along crawling uh so the woman's right next to me  so i i roll my window down and i i motion to her to roll the window down she goes no no and i go 
[00:09:30]  where did then i started going where do you think you were going that you're beeping and annoying  everybody and i'm being real loud and i'm right by the crosswalk so now the pedestrians are starting  to watch and she goes i'm going to work i go i understand everyone's going somewhere i go but  where do you think you're going look in front of you there's nowhere to go i go beeping is just  annoying the shit out of everybody i go you know what you have to do and and she's she goes no 
[00:10:00]  i go relax and this is me talking if there was uh space in front of that person i'd have laid on  the horn like crazy too but you got to understand there's nowhere to go so i start going relax you  must relax and the pedestrians now are just fucking laughing laughing their asses off yeah she will not  look at me not acknowledge me i must have said it 20 times until the light turned green but uh so i  guess there is potential to have some fun out there with some of these people that are losing their  fucking minds yeah it's a complete nightmare out there and uh i don't know what the hell's going 
[00:10:30]  on they said it's uh it's gonna be like this tomorrow again right we'll see unless they throw  that ass wipe cock shit that's in charge of the transit workers union uh out this guy what a clown  just overstepped his boundaries now the um the international transit union uh is saying we never  sanctioned this we never you know you're supposed to come to us first uh they weren't at some kind 
[00:11:00]  of log jam the uh uh mta and the transit union where they couldn't have just sat down and uh sorted  this out they didn't hit some kind of a a jam where it was like well we're stuck on this then fuck you  we're striking right uh also they're not allowed to strike that's a job when you get it it's one of  those jobs we're sorry the perks that go along with the job uh there's a downside you can't fucking  strike a city depends on it it's like the cops the firemen things like that it's there's laws in place 
[00:11:30]  that uh make it illegal to strike and they have fucked uh this city up is what they've done by  striking illegally basically did what terrorists want to do to new york city yeah exactly they pretty  much shut down manhattan today al-qaeda dreams they cream about doing exactly what the uh transit  union has done today shut down a city removed all uh public transportation basically did the job of  al-qaeda you know if a bomb went off in one of the subways here in new york city they would probably 
[00:12:00]  shut down the entire system for a little while and then start bringing it up as they uh eliminate  threats uh all but the the one tube or whatever that was damaged they have succeeded in removing  every bit of public transportation uh from new york city something the terrorists haven't done  bravo good job transit union you're better than the fucking terrorists bravo uh assholes i gotta jump

[00:20:30]  have to address this but it's got to be addressed because you know it it happens too often and it's  it's it's just it's one of those things that has to be addressed what happened look we all like big  kev right we all like big kev you're going there i have to holy shit dude dude i have to you're  blowing up his spot it's not a spot to blow up everyone is freaking out everyone's freaking out 
[00:21:00]  holy crap everyone it's not a secret except to him this is going to solve a problem i'll be honest  i'm relieved because when you said we have to address something i'm sitting there like big saucer eyes  like uh-oh no yeah he's gonna call me out on something i thought i was getting booted yeah exactly  i'm like no no no we're we're yeah jimmy and i are looking around you know we're feeling kind of  confident but not really and then all right go ahead it's because it's all whispering and 
[00:21:30]  everything's going around and stuff like that and it's just got to be brought out all right uh kev  has uh uh no sense of smell not what it is he does it it's a medical thing he's talked about it on  the air a few times which means he has no sense of taste by the way which means how do you eat so many  cupcakes when you can't taste them well oh i thought why not just mash up carrots and eat them  i thought that explained what he wears every day he he had the the surgery and he has lost a lot of  weight yes he has for the new listeners you got to explain that i was talking to kev before the show 
[00:22:00]  today he was close to 600 pounds when we first met him he's now down to 320 giant i believe  giant and he's getting uh two operations to get the excess skin removed which i think  is part of what you're going to bring maybe part of an issue that's going on uh so since he has no  sense of smell uh he's not able to really get a sense of what uh he he is emitting uh at certain  times and there are certain days he comes in here uh today being one of them that it's not that 
[00:22:30]  pleasurable to be in his company  cranky ass as far as my uh sense of smell goes yes cranky ass your olfactory senses my olfactory and  mine yes it is uh it is what is uh called cranky ass sometimes you just get a little sweaty you get a  little thing hey we've all had our our our times i know sometimes i sit in here and i'm sweating and i

[00:39:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:40:00]  Jesus.  It's the homeless shopping spree.  The bus is going to be at the Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack.  Hopefully.  We just found out that they're going, what?  They went up Madison, which is probably the worst place to go.  They're on the line right now.  Let's see.  Let it snow.  Who's this?  This is Danny, guys.  What's up, man? 
[00:40:30]  Danny, where are you guys right now?  We're on the road.  We're still in the city.  We're heading out of the city.  All right.  Could we ask a pertinent question here?  Sure.  Why did the bus driver choose to go up Madison through the heart of Manhattan during a transit  strike instead of going west, right to the West Side Highway, and up like the Henry Hudson  to just get the fuck out of this city?  That's an excellent question.  I can't answer that.  The driver is black. 
[00:41:00]  Maybe that has something to do with it.  I don't know.  Why don't you go ask him why is he going through Manhattan?  Does he have to go to 87?  I don't know how to get to NIAC.  Maybe that's the fastest way.  Yeah, I did hear that number thrown about.  Ask him where he's heading to right now.  Hey, where are we heading to right now?  Like what highway?  What highway?  The GWB to, I believe, 87.  Why would you go that way to the...  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Yeah, you could take the West Side Highway.  Why didn't he take...  Ask him why he didn't take the West Side Highway.  Yeah, ask him that.  Why are we not on the West Side Highway? 
[00:41:30]  I'm not getting a response.  Is the bus not getting a response?  Could you get your arm and, you know, the crook of your elbow,  put it around his throat and snap his neck as he drives?  I would love to.  Ask him why.  Is the bus moving?  Yeah, well, why right now?  All right, like where are you exactly?  Uh, let me see.  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  We're on Broadway.  We're on Broadway in like 70-something.  Incompetent buffoons.  Can he make a left at some point and get on to...  They're on Broadway.  Yeah, not Madison. 
[00:42:00]  Well, Kenny's arguing with them right now.  All right, hold on.  So they're not going to 5th Avenue.  All right, if they're on Broadway, that's still the West Side of Manhattan.  That's okay.  Yeah, but...  They could get on the West Side Highway at 70...  Yeah, that's lower-headed.  All right, all right.  That's lower-headed.  All right, you scared the shit out of them.  All right, so you'll take a left on 72nd to the West Side Highway.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, exactly.  Okay.  All right, make sure they do that.  Don Wicklund's going, I don't know, they're at Madison.  Madison, 5th.  I'm like, Madison?  That would be death to the bit.  Oh, forget about it.  It would not happen today.  All right, Danny, what's going on, man? 
[00:42:30]  Well, the Christmas spirit is alive and well on the bus, and I think the guys want to sing  a song for you.  I think they want to sing some Jingle Bells.  All right, let's hear the homeless sing some more Christmas songs.  You guys ready to sing Jingle Bells?  Yeah.  Yeah, come on, let's sing Jingle Bells.  One, two, three.  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the ways, all the money is to ride and what's on this  day.  Hey.  Jingle Bells, Jingle all the ways, all the money is to ride and what's on this day. 
[00:43:00]  Hey.  Cool.  All right, listen.  All right.  All right, listen.  Jingle Bells, what?  You didn't do it all day?  Shut up.  Guys, all I can say is that I miss Vicki.  All right.  And all right.  What else is going on on the bus?  Anything to report?  Just a lot of drinking.  Of soda pop.  Of soda pop.  And ice tea.  And ice water.  No, actually, eggnog and a little hot chocolate. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  That is correct, sir.  And what?  Coco.  Hot cocoa.  Hot cocoa.  That's how we say it here.  Hot cocoa.  What a coincidence.  Coco is driving the bus.  You have to sign to him, West Side Highway.  Stupid.  All right.  Wait.  Wait.  Someone is saying don't go over the GW Bridge.  Let's go to John in New York.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, John.  Listen, I hope you're not going over the GW Bridge today.  Why? 
[00:44:00]  Why?  I'll stick.  What?  Why?  John?  Why, John?  Go, go.  John.  Little Jimmy Norton.  What's going on, sweet cheeks?  Oh, my God.  I want to shoot you in the head.  Hold on.  Let's get to the point.  What's going on?  Tower Theater New Year's Eve.  Jimmy Norton will be at Tower Theater New Year's Eve.  Dude, why shouldn't they go over the GW?  Yeah, why shouldn't they go over the GW Bridge?  Do not go over the GW.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Why are you going to hit traffic from Palisades?  That's why. 
[00:44:30]  There's traffic everywhere, my friend.  Yeah, well, that's what you get for having a strike, too.  Hit the fucking tunnel.  What were they supposed to do?  There's traffic there, too.  There's five ways off of this fucking rock.  Yeah, and every one of them.  Good luck.  All right.  Thank you.  I saw the GW in the traffic, and it wasn't that bad.  Shadabuka has a great point, by the way.  Shadabuka, what's up?  Boys, boys, how are you today?  Good.  Yeah, I've got to ask you a question on what I've learned today.  Yeah.  I wanted to see if you can do that, what's that, a train guy from a few years back, if you still have that. 
[00:45:00]  That's not what it says on the comments here.  The callers are so caught up.  You know what?  Quality callers are on strike also.  They're supporting the transit workers.  The quality callers are picketing this show, and these are scab callers.  I control the callers.  You're not supposed to change what you want to talk about when you go live.  You had a great little comment.  Right.  Basically, you want to say homeless are riding buses today, and we can't?  Ah.  That's a great comment.  Oh, I'm the one that controls homeless.  There's a transit strike in New York City, and the only people on the bus right now are smelly homeless people. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  See, that would have been a good line.  But the one that you said, stunk on ice.  Fuck dick.  We hate you.  We hate you.  Keith the cop.  What's up, Keith?  Hey, what's going on?  Here it is.  Maybe somebody that'll make sense.  Yes, sir?  I failed off the bus, and I've commandeered the XM van.  Oh, you had to leave the bus?  The homeless are now running amok by themselves on the bus.  Well, isn't Club Soda in there?  Club Soda's in there trying to maintain order, but... 
[00:46:00]  He's miserable.  He looks miserable in the back.  It's even in the rearview mirror.  Keith, why did you leave the bus?  Well, we had to make our way with the XM van.  We ran into a couple of snafus that I had to correct.  Yeah.  All right.  We're back in business.  All right.  Where are you guys right now?  We are on 72nd Street, working our way...  To the West Side Highway?  Yeah, we're going to head north eventually.  Homeless shopping spree is happening as we speak.  They're going to be at the Palisade Center Mall, hopefully by 4.30. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Palisade Center Mall in West Nyack.  And we're encouraging the Pest and the ONA Army to meet at the first wheel, if you're  joining us this year, for the homeless shopping spree.  Right.  All right, Keith.  All right.  See you in a little bit.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  Bye.  What a bunch of morons.  A minister of morons.  I don't understand it.  Big Jewish tits.  Oh.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Kuhu.  I think the homeless should be treated to a nice, relaxing massage. 
[00:47:00]  I want those little kiosks.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Is that great?  God, there is another bang-up idea, my friend.  You know those little kiosks, and they have the massage bench?  Yeah.  And you have to put your face in that little thing, and they have to touch you.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Oh, is that horrid?  Thank you, sir.  Is Big Kev going to be confused for one of the homeless today, you think, in the mall?  Oh, Texas.  Now I'll jump on.  What the hell?  Now you're going to pile on.  Pile on.  I hope he's the last guy that jumps on and digs an elbow in the pile. 
[00:47:30]  As the Pac-Man sound is playing at the end.  It's fun to be on top of the pile instead of being on the bottom of the pile, like I  usually am.  You can't take the first hit.  Uh, Than, what's up?  Uh, what's up, man?  I think we finally have a battle plan for once we get to the mall.  All right, what's that?  And we are going to the Circuit City entrance.  Circuit City entrance, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's sort of the main entrance.  That's where the Ferris wheel is, so we'll have lots of fun.  Goody.  All right. 
[00:48:00]  Um, yeah, and that's pretty much it.  You don't want to know what's going on.  All right.  Somebody had the idea of the homeless getting a massage when they went there in one of those  little kiosks?  I think we could get somebody a rub down.  All right, very good.  And the Pest and the, uh, and the fans, they can meet at the Ferris wheel if you're bored  right now and start gathering.  Yep.  What else is going on, Phan?  They're, uh, they're actually pretty mild-mannered right now.  A little disappointed.  That's all right.  The medicine hasn't kicked in yet.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hear some of them, uh, take some medication and, uh, that changes their personality a bit. 
[00:48:30]  That's right.  That's right.  Hey, Phan, how big, how big is the, uh, Ferris wheel?  I don't know.  How are you holding up, uh, with the, um, the smell in there?  Well, was there, I don't, I wasn't listening.  Was there an intervention going on earlier?  Uh, yes, you could call it an intervention, yes.  All right.  So, it's sort of like a, a dueling thing going on.  Really?  They're fighting it out?  Yeah.  It all depends on, you know, what row you're in. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Make sure you get all the homeless people on the Ferris wheel for one special ride.  Okay.  All right, Phan, anything that happens, call us back.  You got it, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  A lot of people want to know why Jimmy's not on the bus.  Jimmy got arrested last time.  Yeah, Jimmy got arrested on a bus, uh, spent a night in jail because of a bus.  Jimmy does not like homeless people, does not like smells.  I've already gone on one of these, and they stunk.  Yep.  And, uh, that's exactly why.  Jimmy doesn't do this. 
[00:49:30]  Jimmy doesn't even, Jimmy is fancy.  All right.  You're a fancy man.  I'm a gentleman.  Let's go to Bill in New York.  Bill?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right, Bill.  I'm a transport workers' union, uh, bus driver on strike, and I want you to know this was  done in honor so we could all be there at Palisades Mall.  Yeah.  I live up in Rockland Canyon.  Let me tell you something.  We, first of all, the leader of our union, Roger Toussaint, is a fucking idiot.  All right, it's good to hear one of you guys say it.  Hey, he's a fucking idiot. 
[00:50:00]  He's a black guy.  The last good leader of the union was a white guy to start with.  So that's a problem.  I work out of Fresh Pop Depot.  I work Brooklyn in Queens.  Oh, Jesus.  And, hey, believe me, trucking niggers and spicks are the other thing.  Oh, boy.  Oh, I know.  I'm going straight to hell for that.  Fuck them all.  Well, dude, what is the exact sticking point with the MTA contract in the union?  Is there, like, one point where they're just going no?  No.  From what the idiots in our leadership tell us, it's an 8% raise spread out over three years.  Right.  The MTA can certainly afford that, but the MTA can also do a lot better with their management. 
[00:50:30]  They are hardly mismanaged.  But if they were a private agency, they'd go broke in two minutes.  They would have gone 4%, they're saying, and they were willing to talk.  They didn't leave.  I know.  Believe me.  Roger Toussaint's a fucking idiot.  Yeah.  There was nothing that the MTA presented to them that should have made them go, oh, well, fuck you.  We're leaving the table.  Nothing.  Gentlemen, let me tell you. 
[00:51:00]  Nothing ever comes good of a strike.  The Taylor Law is going to fuck us.  Two days pay penalty for each day we go on strike.  So you go strike for three days.  You're never going to get back $1,000 over three years for the money that you lost.  Well, sweetie, I got a question for you.  What does the average worker make a year?  I don't know.  This is like, let's say they want...  Both drivers are making $21,000, and I think the motorman, the guys actually drive the team, about $23,000.  The conductor is about the same.  $23,000 a year?  No, no. 
[00:51:30]  $23,000 an hour.  I know.  All right.  How much a year is that?  Starting pay for a conductor is about $43,000 a year.  Yeah.  I mean, nobody makes a $40,000 paycheck.  You know, believe me, the transit authority is horribly mismanaged.  And they want retirement benefits to kick in at 55 years old, where it's been.  The MTA wants to kick it up to, what was it, 63?  62.  62.  62.  Police.  How many other people fucking have...  Yeah, parity of the police. 
[00:52:00]  I'm sorry.  I got to say, I think the police have a little tougher job, and there's a little more mental  stress and pressure of being a cop than a transit worker.  I understand you guys have your pressures, too, but, you know, retiring at 55 for a cop  is fine.  God bless them if they make it to that age.  Transit worker...  Let me give you an example.  Look at that guy driving the bus with all those Mongols, the Nyack.  I know that on a daily basis. 
[00:52:30]  It's driving.  People do it every fucking day.  It's called a commute.  It all ain't.  It's a pin in the fucking balls.  I almost deny that.  Wait, dude, are you saying that the MTA wants to give them 4% over three years, so at the  end of three years, they'll be making 4% more?  No, no, no, no, no.  They don't want to give them...  We want...  It was three, three, three, four, and then three, somewhere close to that.  Every year?  Each year.  Something like that.  So after three years, they'll have a total of 10% increase.  Yeah, more or less.  Right.  Okay.  It's not much.  It's not outrageous, I don't think.  It's called a raise that a lot of people get. 
[00:53:00]  I mean...  All right.  Hey, Bill, we'll see you at the mall, all right?  Hey, God bless you guys.  All right.  Home of shopping spree.  The bus is on the way to the Palisade Center Mall in West Nyack.  Let's see where they're at.  It's E-Rock.  E-Rock!  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Our first call from E-Rock.  I'm in the back of the bus with a couple of our guests here, and we're talking about  what they want to buy with the money when they get the chance to go shopping here.  We're here with our only female guest, Tina.  All right.  What's Tina's deal, by the way?  Tina, what's your deal?  Like, how come you are where you are right now? 
[00:53:30]  You are where you are?  What?  Drugs and alcohol.  Drugs and alcohol.  Nice.  And a bad relationship.  And a bad relationship.  A recipe for rape.  Something for my nephew and niece and my sister and everybody.  Are you buying for your family?  No.  Yeah, she's going to buy some stuff for her family.  She's not sure yet.  Can we actually talk?  Hey, Eric.  Yeah.  Can we actually talk to her?  You don't want that phone by that ear. 
[00:54:00]  She might say no.  All right.  Hold on one second.  They want to talk to you.  Okay?  Here you go.  Hello?  Hi, Tina.  How are you?  I'm doing all right, sir.  How are you doing?  Good, good.  I was just wondering why, since you probably need a few things yourself, are you thinking  about other people in your shopping?  Oh, no.  My sister's got cancer.  I love her to death.  And I buy everything I can for her.  Wait, wait.  What's wrong with your sister? 
[00:54:30]  Excuse me?  What's wrong with your sister?  She got cancer.  Oh, that's terrible.  Jesus.  That's funny.  And so you're going to buy...  That is not funny.  No, that was a sound that was just playing in the background.  So you're going to buy her something nice?  I know.  Well...  Me and Andy, I watch you on Triple S and on and on and on and on.  Right.  So how long has she actually been ill? 
[00:55:00]  Miss?  No, I just buy for my family.  I don't buy for nobody else.  But is your sister going to be okay?  Well, maybe a pair of snakes if I get it.  What?  Huh?  Yeah.  Stop ruining our bit and talk.  Yeah.  Are you okay?  Tina.  No.  No. 
[00:55:30]  What's the matter?  It's not.  It's called respect.  Hey, Tina.  You know what's going on today, right?  Eh.  Where do you think you...  I'm not big enough to screw up the way it is, man.  You think that, you know, I don't want to put my family through anymore?  No, no.  Tina.  Tina.  You have a merry Christmas.  What?  I have no idea what she's saying.  Thanks for killing our bugs just because you're homeless and your sister's sick.  Yeah, I am homeless.  I've been homeless for over 25 years.  25 years on the streets?  You ever...  Yeah.  Congratulations on the silver anniversary. 
[00:56:00]  You ever sell...  I'm an old little mouse.  Did you ever sell your...  I just dye my hair.  I don't know how you get to deprecate in front of a silver store.  You ever sell your box to...  You ever sell your box?  Tina, you ever sell your box or give head for money?  Yeah, I send my father money all the time.  No, but do you have sex for money?  Excuse me?  Do you have sex for money?  No.  No? 
[00:56:30]  25 years on the streets, you never gave a blowjob for like 10 bucks?  No, I don't give bloodjobs for 10 bucks.  The guy next to you who gave you the phone, he'll give you a hundred for a head.  Hold on a minute.  Hello?  Hey, E-Rock.  Yeah, she doesn't want to talk anymore.  I understand.  Can we talk to someone that's very coherent?  Okay.  Let's see.  Who's still here?  Your name's Angel? 
[00:57:00]  I'm going to try something.  Yeah, I know what you're doing.  I was thinking the same thing.  They think they're going...  How you doing?  Hey, who's this?  It's Angel.  Angel, how are you, buddy?  Bye, bye.  Excuse me?  How are you?  Bye, bye.  Thank you.  Merry Christmas, by the way.  Thank you for reading, you know?  Yeah.  I love you.  What are you going to buy at the mall today?  Well, if I don't get some money, you know, I'm going to go buy me some new clothes for  New Year's.  You're going to buy some clothes, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  That's very nice.  And posters for my daughters in Puerto Rico.  Yeah.  Hey, uh...  Money and whatever.  Angel.  Little keys.  Angel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess this would be a good time to tell you, um...  They're not taking you to the mall.  Uh, no.  They're not...  Okay.  Angel, they're not taking you to the mall right now.  All right.  They're taking you to lock up.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  I guess everyone on that bus has outstanding warrants, and we're taking you to lock up. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  What for what for?  Huh?  What for what?  Uh, exposing yourself.  Excuse me?  Exposing yourself to women.  We're not going to...  That was crazy.  Hey, uh, make an announcement for the rest of the bus for us, please.  Hey, guys.  Everybody's going to get a charge for exposing themselves to women.  What an ass.  Hey, uh... 
[00:58:30]  Everybody's getting...  Exposing themselves.  Yeah, you're an idiot outside.  Hey, uh, Angel.  Yeah?  Angel.  You know that guy that gave you the phone?  Huh?  You know that guy that gave you the phone?  Yeah.  He said, you fucking stink.  Yeah, you gave me something to go to the blue shirt?  All right.  We told him to give the phone to the dirtiest bum on the bus.  Oh, please.  How you going to pull me to get that?  I don't know.  Why did he give it to you?  He wants me to give you the phone. 
[00:59:00]  None of these homeless can go along with a bit.  Come on, I stink.  You guys are buzzkills.  All right.  All right.  Have fun today.  They all rot until they fucking get to the store.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  All right.  Where are you guys?  Uh, where are we right now?  Yo, where are we right now?  Where?  We're on the Palisade Parkway.  All right.  It's moving along pretty well.  Yeah.  As soon as we got out of the city, it started moving pretty fast. 
[00:59:30]  So we're making good time.  All right.  What's the ETA?  How long do we get there?  About half an hour.  Half an hour.  All right.  Thank you, E-Rock.  No problem, sir.  All right.  Let's say hi to Elmer in New Jersey.  Elmer.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What do you think about getting me, a homeless guy, some glamour shots?  Yeah, they got to get one glamour shot.  All right.  Punch it out.  That would be very funny.  Glamour shot.  That would be really, really good.  I want to see that. 
[01:00:00]  Let's see.  I'm hanging up on a lot of people.  Sorry about that.  Let's go to Danny.  Hey, Danny.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  I heard that guy talking about glamour shots.  We had the same idea.  I think we want to bring half a Hulk face to get glamour shots.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Oh, that would be the guy.  He's like the star as far as things like makeovers, ear piercings, and glamour shots, things like that.  We're going to take Jimmy's idea and bring him by the Macy's makeup counter.  Someone's got to get a haircut, too.  Some kind of a style of haircut.  All right.  We will definitely do that.  Actually, I'm here with Gray Wolf and Tippi. 
[01:00:30]  I think I'm going to ask them what they want for Christmas, if that's cool with you guys.  Sure.  Let's go, Danny.  All right.  Hey, Gray Wolf.  What's up, man?  Hi.  How are you?  What do you want for Christmas?  I want a home.  Aww.  Unfortunately, you have to work for those.  That's terrific.  Gray Wolf, you're going to have $202.  What can you do with that money?  What do you want for Christmas?  $202.  I'll spend $2 on a trip back home and try to get a room. 
[01:01:00]  You're going to have a room for Christmas.  That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  That is awful.  Because then once you use it, it's done.  Yeah, I know.  But you can only use that for one night.  You know, don't you want to spread it out a little bit?  Oh, that's one month's rent.  Take his money away.  Yeah, he's not allowed to shop.  He's not allowed to use it for shelter.  Yeah, no food, no shelter.  They're not going to waste this money.  Them's the rules.  It's going to buy things that humiliate them, or they're not going to spend it.  I bet Tippi probably has a different way he'd like to spend it. 
[01:01:30]  Material things that will only get them punched in the face out on the street.  That's what I want them buying.  That's right.  Yeah, a titty bar.  We want to go there.  Hey, Tippi Tom.  Titty bar.  What's up, baby?  Oh, jeez, imagine I'm in a titty bar.  I'm still here.  I'm still up.  What do you want for Christmas?  I don't know.  A titty?  No, I'm blonde and a brunette and a redhead.  Do I have a hat?  And I want all three in bikinis.  What do I meant, Tippi?  I don't care. 
[01:02:00]  But I want to go to the beach.  Tippi wants to take some people to the beach.  I'd like to see him at the beach on a day like today, throw him in the water.  Walking down the beach and the seagulls are just following him.  I'm cold.  Yes, you are.  All right, Danny.  All right, guys.  Hey, have Ben call us soon.  Okay, I will.  All right, if you're just tuning in, it's the homeless shopping spree.  We've got a bus filled with homeless people, and they're on their way to the Palisade Center 
[01:02:30]  Mall in West Nyack.  They should be there by 4.30, it looks like.  If you're going to the mall, I guess the listeners are starting to gather around the  first wheel.  Yes, we want them all there to greet the homeless, help them shop a little bit, and follow them  around the store.  And if you're at the mall, give us a call.  I want to see what's going on there, how crowded it is, and all that junk, okay?  Sure.  We'll go to break with Tippy Tom singing.  Remember this?  Oh, who could forget?  From Stinko Records, it's the new collection of covers from America's favorite derelict. 
[01:03:00]  I'm the original Golden Bumper.  Tippy Tom, regurgitated.  Tom Jones, it's not unusual to be in love.  He's drunk, smells like feet.  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten most of the lyrics.  That's whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop.  Tipy Tom, regurgitated, chews up your favorite pop hits.  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady.  And spews them back out, dirtier, grittier, and stinkier than farts and old beer. 
[01:03:30]  But the lady's mine.  Or something like that.  From your favorite haunting melodies.  Riders on the Storm.  Something like that.  To your most cherished classic rock cut.  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Tippi Tom hunkers down and craps all over him and refuses to wipe.  Trying to sit the night on fire.  And if you act now, you'll receive Tippi Tom's tribute to the town he calls home. 
[01:04:00]  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Start spreading the news.  It's old blue eyes.  I'm leaving today.  Meets old crusty eyes.  I'm gonna be a part of it.  New York, New York.  It's a sappy salute to the city that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams,  and left him blowing strange men for cheap wine in the Port Authority bus terminal. 
[01:04:30]  If I can make it here, I can make it.  Tippi Tom.  And he wins.  Regurgitated.  It's up to you.  New York.  New York.  That's my vote.  Wrapped in a special carrying case, brown in the back, yellow in the front, just like Tom's underwear.  Call 1-800-NO-T-CELL right now for your copy of Tippi Tom.  Regurgitated. 
[01:05:00]  Any more requests?  It's the Opie and Anthony 2005 homeless shopping spree.  Tippi Tom gonna jerk off.  Live from the Palisades Mall in West Nyack, New York.  You know I can jump off.  You are, sir.  You are, sir.  You are.  Yes.  He's dead.  You and Anthony Thomas.  I'm scared.  Infected.  We've got Francine in studio.  You ready for the news, Francine?  Yeah.  Hi, Francine.  Hello, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  You don't want to dance any better.  What about Bill?  I said hi to Bill.  Hi, Bill. 
[01:05:30]  Hey.  How are you?  I love your show.  Bill Chappelle's is great.  Oh.  Oh.  A way to bring it up.  What do you mean?  If Dave Chappelle didn't, like, decide to go away for a while,  we'd still be doing that show.  Yeah, I wouldn't be hanging out doing this shit.  It's a soft subject, I think.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I really liked it, though.  I just want to say I liked it.  Swarf.  Swarf.  Yeah, I mean, it was just like...  Swarf.  It was a great moment of my life, and now it's over,  and I was just, you know, starting to not, like, 
[01:06:00]  think about it every day, and then...  Didn't he bring it up?  Did he tell you?  Good job.  No, he didn't tell me.  Everyone has been told around here not to mention that.  You ever heard us bring it up?  No, I haven't.  We haven't even asked Bill the question everyone asks Bill.  What's Chappelle up to?  We don't even ask, because we know it bothers him.  And you had to just casually say that to him.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that...  I didn't know.  I don't know.  I still liked it, though.  It was great.  Oh, bring it up all that.  Bring it up again. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  First thing, this is not a bit.  He doesn't want to hear that.  Okay.  Eek.  All right.  Apologize.  I'm sorry, Bill.  A little late.  A little fucking late.  Well, this is a little uncomfortable.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I told you to not fucking bring it up.  They're testing you.  Oh.  Don't ever bring it up again.  Okay.  Don't even make eye contact with me for the rest of this week, okay?  No.  What aren't you supposed to bring up as far as Bill Burgo from now on so we know for next 
[01:07:00]  time?  Because some people are saying you're dumb.  I want them to know you're not dumb.  That you know and won't be bringing this up anymore.  Right.  I believe it's just helping.  Jesus fucking Christ.  How many fucking times?  I think.  I was just getting past this fucking shit.  Don't bring it up.  Un-fucking-believable.  Don't bring it up.  Okay.  And you know, finally, you do know that this is off-limits. 
[01:07:30]  Okay.  For Borden, never again be brought up, ever.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we get this out of the way?  Repeat that for me, Francine.  Yep.  I, Francine.  I, Francine.  Will never.  Will never.  While Bill Burr is in studio.  While Bill Burr is in studio.  Bring up the Dave Chappelle Show.  Bring up the Chappelle Show.  Oh, my God. 
[01:08:00]  Get her out of here.  Toby and Anthony.  Send to it to them.  It's the homeless shopping spree.  2005.  Where are we? 
[01:08:30]  We got a bus that's filled with homeless people, and they're on the way to the Palisade Center  Mall in West Nyack.  That's 1,000 Palisade Center Drive.  The listeners are starting to gather at the mall.  We got No Filter Paul on hand.  Let's say hi to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm sitting by the front of all the fans of the show.  Do you want to say hello?  Yeah.  Everyone say hello.  All right.  Good start.  There you go.  How many people?  I think that was about seven.  That was more like 37. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, really?  All right.  That's not fair at all.  37 or 40 right now.  There's a couple of undercobs walking around trying to, in being conspicuous, we already  spotted them.  And there's more walking up right now as we're talking.  All right.  Yeah, if you're going to join the homeless as they shop at the Palisade Center Mall, the  fans...  Shut up!  He can't.  He hung up on them.  Holy shit.  Obi's trying to give the big sell.  Everybody's all anxious today. 
[01:09:30]  Shut the fuck up.  We're the most interactive radio show.  Relax.  We'll give you a chance to talk all you want when it's your turn.  We're here at the Ferris wheel.  Thanks for introducing us to No Filter Paul, by the way.  Oh, you're welcome, Opie.  Oh, God.  I can't wait to pay you back someday.  You're the worst.  Why?  Does he want to go out with you guys?  Can I tell him sometimes?  Like, yeah, well, Opie would love to go out with you.  Yeah, thanks.  You think so?  You think?  I was down in Atlantic City.  Call me a think.  I'm just telling you.  And he's like, let's go gamble. 
[01:10:00]  I'm like, I ain't gambling with you.  And then he asked for my...  It's a gamble being with him.  Then he asked for my...  Black person comes by, they're going to hit you both.  He asked for my phone number, so I had to give him the wrong phone number.  Did you?  Because I didn't know how to tell him I don't want him to have my phone number.  And then it turned out...  Want him to give me a number?  And then it turned out he called this fake phone number like five or six times.  Think of that poor bastard.  And couldn't figure out why I wasn't calling him back or something.  I don't know.  Let's say hi to Ben.  What I was going to say, it's the Palisade Center Mall in West Nyack.  They're gathering at the Ferris wheel.  So if you're on your way to the mall, that's where all the pests in the Army are hanging out right now, 
[01:10:30]  waiting for the bus to arrive.  But with that, let's go to Ben, who's on the bus.  Ben.  Isn't Paul the most fucking annoying person on the face of the earth?  God bless you, Ben.  Ben hates Paul.  Let me tell you something.  Ben hates Paul.  It isn't an act.  It's not for the show.  I'm not...  Ben hates Paul.  He drives me fucking crazy.  He anoints me five times a day.  He called me today.  Tell me, is the thing still going on?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:11:00]  Does he really annoy you?  He annoys me.  Steve and I, we just fuck with him back.  We just can't take him.  It's going to be interesting to see how many people join us today.  It's a weird day.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people weren't sure we were going to do this.  So what's up, Ben?  We're actually, we're making great time.  Kenny is saying we're about 15 minutes away.  Oh, nice.  We're doing real well.  So we're almost there.  We're going to pull into Circuit City.  And they'll have $202 to shop with with these nice American Express gift cards.  Oh, God. 
[01:11:30]  That's sweet.  And you know what?  It's always funny, though.  I mean, I was thinking about it all the years.  What's that?  Oh, we're getting pulled over.  Well, that's good.  We're getting pulled over.  All right.  Stay on the phone.  Last time a bus of ours was pulled over, boy, was that trouble.  This is legal, isn't it?  Yes.  Yes.  Very funny, Ben, with a Rick callback.  All right.  Well, we've been pulled over.  Where are we?  Kenny's getting off the bus.  Was it because the driver wasn't sitting in the back seat? 
[01:12:00]  No?  How did I miss that one?  All right.  We'll wait to see what happens.  The bus has been pulled over.  Wants to get the bus driver's autograph.  He loves him in the new Peter Jackson movie.  He sure wasn't King Kong.  That's what I meant, you fucking...  You dole.  Wow.  Oh, Ben.  Ben, that's good that you take everything completely, literally.  Remove the humor. 
[01:12:30]  He has no idea that the vagueness of it kind of makes it funny.  No, King Kong.  Fucking Ben barreled right ahead.  Big head poking out of a laughing box.  What pulled you over?  Well, I'm...  There's a...  It's actually like a Camaro-type state trooper has pulled us over.  Speeding.  Trooper?  Was the guy speeding?  Obviously.  I don't think we were speeding.  I mean, we weren't going that fast.  I mean, the spot where we have been pulled over at was where traffic was being slowed down 
[01:13:00]  due to some construction.  Oh, speeding.  Was it emissions coming out of the bus?  Just tell him it was Big Kevin.  You guys will be all right.  Oh, he's really angry with you guys, by the way.  I didn't start it.  I was like...  I didn't want any part of it.  Dude, I absolutely didn't either.  But now that it's out there, might as well jump on.  I just walked in and gagged.  By the way, are you guys...  Things are looking good.  Kenny is walking back to the bus here.  All right.  All right.  Let's get a briefing from Kenny.  Yeah, let's get a side call on the phone. 
[01:13:30]  Hello.  What happened?  Kenny, what happened?  What was the problem?  We're not getting too much of a warm reception.  We're not welcome.  Wait a minute.  Was that because they know where you're going and everything?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everybody knows they're ready for us.  So what did the guy say?  I don't want to repeat it on the radio, especially since all the cops are listening.  Was it something to do with when you get there? 
[01:14:00]  Was it something to do with what they're doing on the bus?  Was it something to do with the speed of the bus?  What was the...  Be vague, but give us as much info as you can.  We bended a few laws.  Bended a few laws.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I'll leave it at that.  I'll leave it at that.  I'll use my imagination.  All right.  I can't understand how...  You know, there's transporting garbage along. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Isn't it supposed to be in a container with a cover on it, a tarp?  And don't you need a fucking dump permit?  Jesus.  Nappy douche permit.  I suck.  So they know we're coming.  Yeah, yeah.  They know we're coming.  I don't know if they erected a wall to keep us out yet.  Was it a New York trooper?  Yeah.  He was a handsome gentleman.  He was wearing a purple tie.  Very handsome? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, with that big square jaw.  Yeah.  You know the type.  All right.  So are you guys off again?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're rolling.  All right.  So regardless of what he said and the bending of some rules and regulations, let's say, it's on.  He didn't stop you and prohibit you from doing anything, right?  Oh, no.  He just gave us a friendly warning.  A friendly warning.  A friendly warning.  Was there something going on through the windows of the bus that perhaps caught his attention? 
[01:15:30]  Oh, no, no.  Everybody's well behaved.  All right.  I'm just trying to figure it out.  Maybe off air we can get to the bottom of that because I would love to know what the bending is.  We'll have complete details tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny.  We'll keep you updated.  All right.  It's all good.  I'm going to charm them.  And you guys are about, what, 15 minutes from the mall?  We're checking traffic online where we're at, and it's clear sailing. 
[01:16:00]  You guys should be there in 10, 15 minutes.  Well, we'll see.  We're getting rerouted.  Oh, I know what you did wrong.  Yeah, we're getting rerouted.  Commercial vehicle.  Right.  Oh, you dummies.  Commercial vehicle.  All right.  I'll call you back.  All right.  A little detour for the boys.  They're, uh, Jesus.  They've got to find a way around, uh, commercial vehicle.  What a dope.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jim.  Who's fighting them? 
[01:16:30]  Ben just heard it.  King Kong.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jim's at the mall.  Jim.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Palisade Center Mall, West Nyack, if you want to join us.  Uh, get to the first wheel.  Yes.  We're downstairs at the entrance.  It's like the fucking president's about to show up here or something.  There's so much security here.  Oh, really?  There's about 30 people upstairs, and about eight of us smoking cigarettes downstairs.  There's about three security guards, about three unmarked cars, right in the, uh, security's  walking over me right now.  Really?  Yeah.  It's like the fucking president's about to show up now.  What, uh, what is security doing? 
[01:17:00]  Is he hassling you, man?  No, they're waiting to another security guy driving by right now, actually.  Uh-huh.  Security guys, we're on the air right now.  Do you know what?  Do you want to talk to the guys?  We're on the air right now with them.  What's going on?  What?  Do you want to talk to L.P. and Anthony?  We're on the air right now.  He's a security guy right now.  All right.  How you doing, sir?  Is that it?  Yeah, they're on the air.  I'm here.  Hi, sir.  Hello.  Hi.  How you doing, man?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  Uh, you guys, uh, expecting the homeless any minute now to show up shopping?  Have you been briefed? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  They've briefed you about this, and, uh, what's the protocol here?  How is, how should this situation be handled?  What do you mean?  Uh, did they give you any special instructions as to what to do when the homeless arrive?  Are they to be escorted everywhere?  Keep it from being a mess?  I don't know.  Keep it from being a mess?  Have you been told maybe to prohibit them from anything, or do they have free reign  to shop wherever they want in the mall?  I'm, uh, nobody's going to tell them not to shop.  It's not a legal shop, you know?  All right.  Just wondering, you know, because I, did, did you have a meeting about this with the 
[01:18:00]  rest of the security for the mall today?  Yeah.  You did.  And what, what was, uh, what was told in that meeting?  I was off today.  They, uh, told me to, hold on a second.  He was off today.  Hold on.  Yeah.  I'm holding.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, they're mobilizing troops right now.  What?  Oh my God.  What is so funny, sir?  They're on their walkie-talkies, their cell phones, mobilizing the troops to show up at  the entrance here, man.  It's just like fucking bushes in town or something.  Oh, we're back to the listener? 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  I didn't know he passed the phone over.  Oh, the security guy didn't want to talk anymore, I guess.  They're on their walkie-talkies, their cell phones right now, mobilizing.  He probably realized that wasn't the brightest move.  Keep us informed there, Jim.  All right, boys.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Maggie.  She's calling all the way from Syracuse.  Maggie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to let you know that the mall has been prepped that you're coming.  Now, how do you know up there in Syracuse?  Because I work for them.  Oh, you do?  In what capacity?  I work in their home office as a secretary. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, in the home office?  Now, what kind of briefings have been given?  What kind of information have you been getting about this?  Actually, I haven't been getting any information.  I don't know what they've been told to do.  I just know that they knew that you guys were coming.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  And is it going to be a problem, or are these guys going to be able to go around and just shop?  I think that they're going to let the guys, as long as nothing gets out of control, I think they're going to be fine.  All right, that's a problem.  Yeah.  You haven't hung with our listeners yet.  No, we should be fine. 
[01:19:30]  These guys are going to be well-behaved.  As long as everything goes smoothly, there shouldn't be a problem.  You know, you will be pleasantly surprised at how caring and giving our listeners are and how nice this will be for the homeless people.  I can't even say it without laughing.  Basically, the only reason we do this every year is so we...  Because you're charitable fellows.  Well, no, we're hoping for a disaster.  I mean, that's really it.  You know, a disaster where we still get to keep our jobs. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  That is the ideal situation for this program.  Always has been over the years.  A disaster where we actually keep our jobs.  The bigger the disaster, the better, as long as we keep our jobs.  Basically, we're looking for page three coverage, and we still get to keep our jobs.  The more people that get hurt, and the less it affects us financially.  That's right.  That is pretty much it in a nutshell.  Front page means definite firing.  That's why we hope for, like, page three.  What's the name of the mall? 
[01:20:30]  Pacific Palisades Mall.  West Nyack.  The bus should be arriving very soon.  Actually, I'm going to go to the bus.  Thanks, Maggie.  No problem.  All right.  Let's say hi to...  I don't even know who we're saying hi to.  Who's this?  Yo, yo, yo.  Hello?  Who's this?  Hi.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  What do you got?  I've got Jose, who's all smiles but really wants some apple juice.  Yeah, Jose, let's explain for the new listeners.  He's one of the homeless guys, and he loves to masturbate in public. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Perhaps, well, he cannot keep it in his pants.  We also had a special treat in that Santa just unleashed his special brand of holiday cheer  in the bathroom.  I don't want to see what's going on in the bathroom.  Homemade eggnog for everybody.  He dropped off a little brown tree ornament, Sidney.  He dropped off a yuletide log.  All right.  Would you like me to ask Jose here what he wants to get for Christmas here? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Jose, what do you want to get at the mall for Christmas, man?  Uh-huh.  Jose.  Oh, boy.  What do you want to get for Christmas?  Sidney playing.  Uh-huh.  Hot pants, underwear, size, sneakers.  Sneakers?  And $40 in my pocket.  $40 in his pocket and sneakers, I think.  I have no idea what he's fucking talking about.  Yeah, what would you like to ask him?  Ask Jose if he's going to have a problem keeping his junk in his pants. 
[01:22:00]  Okay.  Jose, you're going to have trouble not touching yourself at the mall.  There's going to be a lot of pretty women there.  All right.  I'll be here much, sir.  You promise?  I'll never do that.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Are you...  Jose, are you interested in picking up any women's attire, any women's dresses?  You're not interested.  You're not interested.  You're not interested.  You're not interested.  Nothing?  Hello?  I'm guessing.  Somebody else is talking to him, and he's getting easily distracted. 
[01:22:30]  Sorry.  All right.  Does this mall have a website or something?  Because last year, I remember, we went to the...  Oh, it does?  Yeah.  It looks beautiful.  I want to...  Because I want to see and go through some of the stores.  Damn.  I can't seem to find the link.  If you could help me, Steve, and look at that and then punch it up on my computer over here.  We're about...  Just for an update, we are on Route 59, about five minutes away.  Five minutes away from the mall.  If you're joining the homeless for the homeless shopping spree, get yourself to the first wheel. 
[01:23:00]  That's where the listeners are gathering.  All right, then.  We'll check in with you guys in a few minutes.  Call us when you guys are pulling up, all right?  All right.  You got it.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's see.  Waiting for you.  Getting drunk.  John at the mall.  John, what's up?  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  John, Steve, everybody.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Oh.  Oh, and hey.  Oh, you got the camera working today?  Yeah, there's a few privileged people that are able to check out the broadcast. 
[01:23:30]  Nothing too exciting going on in here, but you just get to kind of, you know, check it out.  Check out the webcam.  Check out Jimmy eating pretzels and chewing them up and regurgitating them.  Would you close your mouth?  You're disgusting.  John, what's up?  Nothing.  We're hanging out in the mall parking lot.  Okay.  Yeah, but the coolest thing is is that me and my buddy Ray, we work for Verizon, and we  work out of, like, Bergen County, and we're up here in our work truck.  Yeah.  So you see a big Verizon line rig right outside the Best Buy. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  They're just chilling out, drinking a few beers.  Okay.  But I'll tell you right now, you got to see security.  They're, like, hovering the place.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's like they keep walking up to us and, like, what are you guys doing?  Oh, yeah, we're working on the lines.  Oh, right on.  They're, like, you're not here for that O&A thing.  Like, oh, no, what are you talking about?  Well, this is a legendary bit.  Why the big deal?  We're just helping.  Well, the last time we did this, there was thousands of people that showed up at the  mall.  I don't think we're going to get that today.  Oh, no, I think you're wrong.  I think you're wrong because there's no parking. 
[01:24:30]  We're taking up, like, you know, we got the big line rig with the big reel of fiber optics  on the back.  We're taking up, like, three parking spots.  Right.  People hate us as it is.  I bet you there's a lot of people in their car listening to the show because they don't  all have my fives and they're waiting for them to show and then they're going to hit  the mall.  Dude, this is going to be great.  Me and my partner, Ray, we got $100 between the two of us.  We're going to give them to one of you guys, send them into, like, Victoria's Secret,  right, sit there and say, look, try something a little slinky for the help over there.  Right.  I think that's what you got to do is send them in there so you can get them in the display 
[01:25:00]  window, maybe humping some mannequins or something.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Okay, brother.  Let's go to Zach in Baltimore.  Zach?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Pookie.  How you doing?  Hi, Zach in Baltimore.  You guys are missing the obvious.  I think half a Hulk face needs a picture with Santa.  I mentioned that the other day, but I don't know if they'll allow adults to get pictures,  especially ones that have spoiled their lives.  Someone else has a great idea for a half a Hulk face.  Big, dirty Phil.  Big, dirty Phil.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey. 
[01:25:30]  Hey, sweet tits.  Hi, Phil.  Hey, you got to have a half a Hulk face go try on some ski masks.  Punching out, boy.  Yes.  Got to say hi to Reverend Rev. Daniel.  Okay.  Who just in capital letters and exclamation points printed yawn, yawn, yawn.  Hey, enjoy this little bounce.  There you go.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  Oh, look at that.  You banned him? 
[01:26:00]  I'm bouncing him.  I used to be able to save these people.  I can't save them anymore.  Nope.  That's it.  I didn't like the yawn thing he was doing.  Frenchy, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Merry Christmas.  Thanks, Frenchy.  You're very welcome, Mike.  Sorry, I couldn't hear the show.  I'm in California.  I'm in California.  Urgent business.  Yes, it's absolutely beautiful.  25.  I mean, 80 degrees.  Wonderful.  Sunny.  25.  No strike.  This must be a very important call.  So why are you calling us, Frenchy? 
[01:26:30]  I don't know, because fucking Billy Mac said, oh, you gotta call the show.  You gotta call the show.  I'm like, okay.  It is amazing how uninteresting he is.  It's almost like a guy doing a parody of an uninteresting person.  Right.  Yeah.  If there was a show that needed somebody to call up and be uninteresting, and he did it,  you would say, no, it's too over the top.  Yeah, you're overacting.  You're not being authentic enough as an uninteresting guy.  No human is that truly devoid of anything of value to say. 
[01:27:00]  You have to at least have something that one person somewhere may be interested in, or  it won't be believable.  But you, it's nothing.  There is not one thing, and that makes it not believable.  When in the first moment of your call, you almost do centigrade, and then you go to Fahrenheit,  you're a fucking dullard, and you should never call another radio show in your life.  I think that was what he was doing.  25, 70, centigrade.  Shut up.  Jeff in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Merry Christmas. 
[01:27:30]  You too, Jeff.  Jimmy, happy birthday.  Thank you, Jeff.  Hey, I'd like to, can we sponsor any of these people?  I can't be there.  You guys are putting me in the charitable mood.  Well, I think enough listeners will be handing over cash today, so that's a good thing.  Yeah, don't you worry about it.  Yeah, I appreciate it, Jeff.  No problem.  Enjoy.  Keep up the good work, boys.  All right, man.  But that is a good idea in the future to sponsor.  That's a great idea for next year.  Fashion.  They could go into some of the fashion stores.  They might be at the mall.  Let's hear what's going on.  Who's this?  This would be Ben.  Ben, what's up, buddy?  What's up, guys? 
[01:28:00]  We are pulling into Circuit City now.  I see a bunch of idiots out front waiting for us.  So we will do the usual.  We'll bring all the homeless off the bus and get them all going.  I'm interested.  You know, and then this thing, the third year we've done this, it's always interesting to  see who goes where.  Right.  Because, you know, like, you always get the two guys that go right to the bar.  And so it should be interesting.  It's actually got a good crowd, and we're pulling up right now.  We're coming up by JCPenney.  All right.  You're going to have to have Sidecar announce the homeless one by one as they leave the bus. 
[01:28:30]  I love that part of this every year.  Absolutely.  All right.  Give him a list of the names and have him announce it to the crowd.  Okay.  All right.  Well, they're at the mall, Ant.  Now the fun starts.  Hey, Ben, do you really dislike Paul?  It's coming off.  Okay.  I don't know their names.  Oh, behind the scenes, uh...  Holy mackerel.  Look at the reception we're getting.  Really?  Holy mackerel.  There's got to be tens of people.  Yep.  No.  Oh, I see Pat Monaki's fathead in the crowd. 
[01:29:00]  Of course.  Oh, wait.  Here's some...  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  What?  Jimmy.  Jimmy's farting, which is usually no big deal, but now he pulls his pants down.  Jesus.  I can't work in this environment.  I'm a professional broadcaster.  This is no way to do a radio show.  What the fuck?  Thank God.  Sidecar.  Hard to work with an owner, eh?  Back to you.  Yeah.  I might have to talk to the security people. 
[01:29:30]  Why?  So I might have to hand the phone off.  Why?  Why?  Why?  What are they doing?  I just want to make sure we're all good, because you've got about 200 people out here chanting  already.  Let's hear the chant.  You're still on the bus.  Yeah.  Could you pop the door shut?  There we go.  Oh.  Yeah, there's some people there.  That's nice.  You're right.  They were in the cars listening. 
[01:30:00]  Holy crap.  We're here.  We're here.  We're here.  We're here.  We're here.  We're here.  Wow.  It's like a sports team coming home after a big victory.  No, it's like black and white footage from the 40s in Europe.  I'm going to hand the phone off.  I'm going to hand the phone off.  The New York Disgusting's.  Hey, who's this?  We are homeless. 
[01:30:30]  I can't hear it.  Thanks.  We are homeless.  Hello?  Who?  We want homeless.  Oh.  Yeah, the chant thing.  We want homeless.  Of course.  All right.  Who's this, Ben?  Keep them.  Good.  This is Danny.  I'm sorry.  It's so hard to hear you.  We have a huge crowd in front of this mall.  It's unbelievable.  Awesome.  There's got to be at least 300 people just waiting outside.  It's just great.  Wow.  And we're getting pictures and video of this.  We'll have it up on the websites later on tonight.  Absolutely.  The pest coming through again.  That is bravo.  The ONA Army coming through again.  It's unbelievable here right now. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  You guys got to, like, intro the homeless one by one live on the show.  Yeah, for the crowd out there.  As they leave the bus individually, give them the big intro so the crowd can know who they are.  That's right.  And maybe pick their favorite if they want to buy them something.  We're looking for Keith because he's, I think he's the only one that actually knows all of their names.  Yes, he does.  A couple of wins for Keith.  Half a Hulk face!  Oh, they're chanting for half a Hulk face.  Oh, I knew he would be a crowd favorite. 
[01:31:30]  An early favorite.  I knew it.  He would be a crowd favorite.  When he walks off that bus and they see that half a Hulk face, they're going to run.  They're going to just flee?  See, this is going to be a recreation of the mall scene from that Dawn of the Dead.  They're going to have to barricade the doors and hope for the best.  All right.  What do we got?  All right.  Well, we're still waiting.  Keith's in the van, so we're waiting for Keith, and I guess he'll be introing all these guys.  Okay.  So, you know, I'm just trying to get to where we are. 
[01:32:00]  He was a little further behind us.  So, once he gets there, we'll be introing all the guys and going in.  All right.  It's not too early to join the crowd up at the Palisades Center Mall, 1000 Palisades Center Drive, West Nyack, New York.  It's the homeless shopping spree 2005.  All right.  They're organizing, so we're just sitting here.  Yeah, we're organizing.  You want me to call you back when we're ready?  What do you think?  It might be a few minutes for Keith to get around to where we're at. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, call him back when we're ready.  Don't have anyone step off the bus until you're ready for the big intro.  No, we want the big reveal.  We want to hear the big reveal.  Absolutely.  All right.  Call us back.  Okay.  Hey, man.  I wasn't expecting a crowd like that.  I've got to be honest.  That's nice, man.  Got to thank the PES and the ONA Army.  Some of them are probably still working until 5.  Yeah, it's going to be – I think it's going to grow.  And there's still time.  They're going to be in the lot for a little while there for the big introductions.  And then they'll make their way into the mall so there's plenty of time to still get down there. 
[01:33:00]  That's right.  And pick out a favorite, like I said.  Maybe buy him a pair of shoes.  Right.  Wouldn't that be nice?  He gets to take those old shoes off in a store.  The beauty is buy him a size too small.  A little ow with every step.  Ow.  Ow.  Yeah, they're waterproof, but ooch.  Ooch.  Hey, one of the homeless that will be shopping today is Gray Wolf, one of our faves. 
[01:33:30]  We should play the Gray Wolf song.  Do we have the new version?  Not yet.  No, he just wrote the second half of the song.  We're going to re-record it soon.  Opie, I would also like to watch.  He was telling me, though, that Tippi Tom dies at the end of the song.  So, I want to tip a little.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to tip a little here.  Here it is.  Ah, there it goes.  I'm tipping a little to Ziggy.  This is our first homeless shopping spree that is Ziggy free.  That's right.  Ziggy was a very entertaining, homeless little feller, and he has since died. 
[01:34:00]  That's right.  He died.  That's right.  It's very sad.  That's right, Anthony.  And he will not be there this year.  But in spirit, he will be there.  I remember his haunting rendition of A Silent Night.  Yeah.  Do we still have Silent Night around?  That would be fantastic.  See, we should have prepared and had some clips of the homeless people, but yeah. 
[01:34:30]  It would be funny if Ben was here and you played the clip.  He would be like, no, you shouldn't play Laugh Drobber, a death thing.  I don't know.  You know, we got Gray Wolf's plan.  It's an obvious ass boob.  All right.  Here's Gray Wolf and Shelter Me from the pouring rain, everyone.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  This is a story about a man. 
[01:35:00]  He always was so lonely at night, but his voice was rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train season.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tiffy told Tommy, let's go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  He plays at night, and now you have no way to go.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad. 
[01:35:30]  Get out of here.  And he says, and you don't have an angel.  And he says, that angel.  Shelter Me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life. 
[01:36:00]  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter Me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  There's just a little peace. 
[01:36:30]  There he is, Gray Wolf and Shelter Me.  Yes.  And I think we're ready for the homeless to leave the bus.  We've got Keith the cop on the line.  Keith.  Hey, gentlemen.  What's going on?  How are you?  Hi, sugar.  By the way, before everyone gets arrested,  I just want to let you know that you did a great job  at the homeless shopping spree once again this year, Keith.  Thank you very much.  Keith really took this bid and made it his own, really.  Yes.  I just wanted, okay, real quick, I had a meeting with the mall security. 
[01:37:00]  I had a meeting with the Clarkson Police Department, and they said, let the homeless shop.  Yeah.  Oh, bravo.  Oh, my God.  It's a madhouse.  There's got to be 20 people out there.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  There'll be a couple more.  Paul's always underestimating.  Yeah, that sounds good. 
[01:37:30]  You're going to have to scream it so they hear the names.  You got it, okay?  All right, here we go.  They're about to leave the bus.  All right, everybody.  First off, we have Tina.  Yeah.  All right, start slow.  We don't really know Tina.  Yeah.  Next up, Gray Wolf, everybody.  Gray Wolf.  Yeah, Gray Wolf's a favorite.  Gray Wolf.  Gippy Tom.  Gippy Tom. 
[01:38:00]  Gippy Tom.  The angel.  Here they go.  Here's the moon.  Gippy Tom.  Gippy Tom.  Yeah, you brought the headline around too soon.  And Rudolph.  And Rudolph.  You can't have Christmas.  Christmas without Santa Claus.  This guy sees his homeless Santa Claus.  He's great.  The pictures will be up on the site's line. 
[01:38:30]  I can't wait to see the video of this.  Santa's carrying a sign.  It says, can you spare a dollar for food pot?  And he got his first dollar.  Oh, I can't wait.  Oh, man.  Hey, did you want?  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, here we go.  Hi, everybody.  It's him.  I'm a Hulk.  I'm a Hulk.  I'm a Hulk.  I'm a Hulk.  Have a Hulk face. 
[01:39:00]  I can't hear it.  Everybody here, James, James on the board.  Oh, they should have ended with have a hug face.  Of course they should have.  What's wrong with these people?  He has no clue.  Last but not least, we have Jose the dog boy.  Jose the dog boy?  He's the one that likes to masturbate in public.  Oh, I thought that was Angel.  He can't help himself.  He will whip out his junk.  All right, everybody, that's those guys off the bus. 
[01:39:30]  I'm going to get him on.  I'm going to get him split up, and then we'll do a couple callings once we get him shopping.  All right, thank you, Keith.  All right, sounds good.  All right, there they go.  They have made it to the mall, Anthony.  Let's all just pray, okay?  Please, God, let us have a homeless shopping spree that does not jeopardize our job.  Please let us get through this without nary a thing that could get us fired.  We are just trying to do your work, oh, Lord.  God, will we ever learn? 
[01:40:00]  Will we?  I ask for your guidance on this very special day.  Please be with us.  Please be our stinky co-pilot during this homeless shopping spree.  God, I've put all my eggs in this basket.  Please don't let these two self-destructive millionaires fuck this up again.  Amen.  I know what's bad about this time.  We now have fuck you money, so we don't even care on any level. 
[01:40:30]  I don't have fuck you money.  I have, I have, oh yeah, money.  Ug from Buffalo, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, ONA, Jimmy?  Happy birthday.  Thanks, Ug.  Appreciate the sentiment.  Not a problem.  I got a couple things.  One, I think the Catholic Church could really learn a lot about charity from you guys.  That's right.  I mean, honestly, they've got to start stepping it up if they want to really get the crowd  to pay the money.  All right, Ug.  I've got to cut you off because Ben is in the mall.  We've got to get an update here.  All right.  Ben is inside the Palisade Center Mall in West Nyack. 
[01:41:00]  The homeless are starting to check things out.  Ben.  We've got to get about this.  We're out of credit.  We have a huge turnout here.  We've got easily a few hundred people here.  We're just finally into the mall, and Kenny and I are going to take Tippi Tom and Gray Wolf  and begin our little festivities here.  So, Gray Wolf, where do you want to start shopping today?  Where should we start?  What do you want to buy first?  I have no clue.  As you can see, Gray Wolf is fully together.  They have no reference point. 
[01:41:30]  It must be like alien territory to them.  What do you want to buy, a sock and a cup?  Yeah, they're used to walking into these places and immediately getting kicked out.  They don't know what it's like to buy something nice, to have the ability to buy something nice.  They're so poor.  They're so black.  Who said that?  Wolf Blitzer is with them, I think.  I love you, and be healthy as well.  Is Celine Dion with them? 
[01:42:00]  Let them touch them.  Let them just touch them.  Perhaps Tippi Tom wants to buy a kayak.  Let him buy it.  All right.  I don't know what happened there.  What happened there?  There was yelling, and then we were disconnected.  I hope someone just bit Ben's hand, and he dropped his phone.  Some rabies-ridden animal bit his hand.  Let's go to Brian in New Jersey.  Brian, what's up?  ONA.  How are you guys doing?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Happy birthday, buddy.  Thank you, Brian.  Hey, guys.  I want to say, just don't let these guys waste any of that hard-earned money that you guys 
[01:42:30]  are giving them on anything by Rich Voss.  Do they even sell Voss stuff in real stores?  They pay these CDs in stores, man.  Of course not.  They're Spencer's.  Don't let them waste that good hard-earned money on that.  I'd rather see them seriously spend it on a sock and a cup.  You could break it into quarters and use it as a shank out in the streets, perhaps.  What?  His CD.  Well, you can actually get it in Spencer's next to the rubber duty and plastic vomit.  It's a gag gift.  Like, your friends think they're going to laugh and enjoy this.  That's a great idea. 
[01:43:00]  Let's go to Andrew in Michigan.  Andrew.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  The whole country listening in as the homeless shops.  Thanks, man.  Just wondering if any of the homeless maybe want to go ice skating.  There happens to be a rink in the Tallisades Mall.  There's an ice skating rink in the mall?  There most certainly is.  They have an IMAX theater.  It's like the biggest mall of all time, basically.  Yeah, it's a huge, huge mall.  Wow.  All right, Andrew.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Todd in Missouri. 
[01:43:30]  Todd, what's up?  Hey, Opie is a smart broadcaster.  Opie, you did the smartest thing I think I've ever heard anybody did.  He laid it all on Keith's lap by saying, yeah, Keith kind of took this, made it his own.  Oh, wow.  You know something?  I didn't even notice that.  It sounded so much like a natural statement.  I didn't realize it was some way to get out of trouble later on.  And the beautiful thing was that the guy who finds Opie Intelligence said, well, how did  he say it?  He goes, I fucking forgot how he said it. 
[01:44:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Hold on, Todd.  Hold on.  He fucked up the pants.  The guy screwed up, and I forgot what he said wrong.  I almost said it right.  Todd, I've got to cut you off, because we've got Ben back.  They have begun shopping.  Ben, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I just brought Tippi Tom at the Zales Jewelers, and that was a very interesting experience.  But Tom now wants to go and find someone that serves liquor.  What a shock.  Oh, really?  Oh, they might want to have a little Christmas beverage.  Well, that's fine. 
[01:44:30]  I don't see why they couldn't.  No surprise Ben picked Tippi Tom for this mission.  Oh, good point.  See, Ben knows in a fucking hour Tippi Tom will be carrying him.  Come on, Ben.  You've got to slow down.  Hey, why don't we get this drunk out of here, everybody?  I want a shock.  He thinks he knows Tom Brady.  Ha ha ha.  Ben and Tippi Tom are going to be on all fours on the skating rink looking for blow.  Yeah, all the ice shavings are going to be trying to snort.  All they're going to get is a brain freeze for Christmas. 
[01:45:00]  All right, Ben.  Grey Wolf is doing something.  Grey Wolf wants to buy some CDs, amazingly.  So we're going to find a music shop.  All right.  Music store.  And we're just going to roll.  I mean, we just got into the center of the mall.  We're turning up a few hours ago.  We've got a huge crowd following us.  And Tippi Tom has replaced Ziggy as the Mick Jagger of the group.  He is.  The Mick Jagger.  He's getting photographed.  People have got tape recorders having Tippi Tom wish their family Merry Christmas.  It's fucking bizarre. 
[01:45:30]  He's a celebrity.  Yeah, he is.  It's good to know that Ziggy's tradition lives on.  Yes.  So we're going to walk around and check back in a little bit.  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  Get everyone else to call in, all right?  All right.  All right.  There's a Rascals Comedy Club in there?  Yes.  I wouldn't know.  Really?  Nope.  Wouldn't know.  I want to do open mic.  Get me on stage.  It's golden buns.  Let's go to Gio in New Jersey. 
[01:46:00]  Gio.  Gio, wait.  What's going on?  Sarcastic.  Nor will I ever.  I love Jimmy.  After good old call that fell out a couple years ago?  Yeah.  I never went back.  Gio.  Yes, sir.  Hey, listen.  This reminds me of the very first one you guys had.  It brings back really great memories.  I'm an electrician.  We were working at the Shore Hills Mall.  Yeah.  And we were listening, and all of a sudden, here come these friggin' animals, like, you  know, walking through the mall with all the cops.  Remember the Shore Hills?  That was the first one you did? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was our favorite.  That was my favorite.  So it brings back great memories.  This is funny as shit, man.  Oh, thanks, bro.  Yeah, a bunch of...  Is this the third one we've done?  I think so.  Wow.  There's a lot of restaurants in that place, too.  Yeah.  So that's not good, because they're all going to end up drinking.  Who's this?  Hey, Sam.  Dan, what's up?  All right.  What's up?  Oh, Dan.  What's up, Dan?  Yeah, we got Rudolph and Santa.  They're perusing Abercrombie and Fitch.  Abercrombie and Fitch?  What are they looking at? 
[01:47:00]  Pants.  All they see is pants with holes in them.  They're like, ah, we're at home.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if this is maybe the best store for them, but it's just what they're in right  now.  Yeah.  Are they thinking of maybe trying some stuff on?  Do you hear the fucking alarm going off in the background?  The stench alarm?  Yeah, there's a lot of touching of the material, which I'm sure is making the people at work  here very happy.  How many do you think are going to try to shoplift? 
[01:47:30]  I don't know.  Because I don't think they have any concept of the alarm systems in there, where if you  put it down your...  No.  Well, there goes, actually.  Yeah, Dan, help us out, because we need a visual here.  What's the deal?  Is the security following you guys around?  Is there a big crowd following Tippy Tom?  What's the deal?  We have a good number of tests with every little group here.  Okay.  So, right now, it looks like there's been some discussion, and we're going to find another  store that perhaps suits their taste a little better. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  So far, the homeless haven't bought anything yet.  No.  We're going to find some store where everything's $8, so...  All right.  Very good.  I'll call you when we get there.  All right.  E-Rock is on the line with Jose, who loves to show his penis in public.  Yeah, I love to send it out.  Or E-Rock, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  We're in a bed store, and they're trying out some of those mattresses that kind of fit  your form.  Yeah.  And they're trying out...  Do you like this?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  He's afraid to go ahead.  Go ahead.  Are you in Brookstone? 
[01:48:30]  No.  A place called Dormia.  Oh.  No, you know this is a bed.  He didn't recognize it.  No, yeah.  I know it's high.  It's a bed.  It's close to like $5,000.  I think it's about $5,000.  You can't buy this.  He wants to buy the bed.  Is it one of those with that space-age foam that kind of wraps around you?  Well, the one that Jose's looking at here is the one that...  It's a mattress, but it has like the pillow cushioning that's sewn on top of it.  Right.  The pillow tops.  The pillow top mattress.  Is he laying down on it?  Go ahead.  You can lay down on it, you know. 
[01:49:00]  Go ahead.  Don't be afraid of it.  You can lay down on it.  Go ahead.  It's a bed.  Go ahead.  Oh, just have him lay down on the floor.  There you go.  There you go.  Is he sleeping already?  He's probably going to nod out.  He wet the bed already.  He's pissed it.  We owe five grand to the place because he pissed the mattress.  He's laying down on the mattress.  We have four different homeless people trying out beds here.  Over on this bed here is Tina and Angel.  Oh, yeah.  Are you rubbing her leg? 
[01:49:30]  He's giving her five bucks at the Amex gift card.  Swiping it through her twat.  He just cuts her corner off with some scissors.  Hey, they want to talk to you.  How do you like the mattress?  Uh-oh.  Hello?  We lost the rock.  All right.  Walk.  She ate the phone or something.  Well, so far, so good.  Why don't we take a break?  There's also an indoor train.  Indoor train.  They could all get on the choo-choo, I want pictures.  I think we got a good crew out there. 
[01:50:00]  They'll get some fine pictures from the websites later on today.  E-Rock is back on the line before we take a break.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Hey.  All right.  Apparently, she hit the button on the phone and hung up.  They're trying out different events right now.  Yeah.  And apparently, the guy who's running the store right now is calling his manager.  He's not happy that they're in here.  Oh, that's too bad.  They just want to shop.  Let them touch it.  Why does it always have to come down to this?  There's poor people not sleeping in the bed.  Go ahead.  Pull the covers up. 
[01:50:30]  Take a nap.  We'll come back.  Pull the covers up.  Oh, no.  I thought it was just a bare mattress.  There's, like, sheets and stuff on it?  Well, there's one sheet that says Dormy on, like a design sheet, just for a look.  Yeah.  He's in the front bed that's, it looks like it splits in two with the king.  Nice.  He kind of does the chromatic thing.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  It's the bed that's in the display window, and he's laying in here snuggled in the blanket.  Snuggled.  All right, let's go.  E-Rock, stay on the line, but I'm going to sidecar Kenny. 
[01:51:00]  Okay.  Kenny, what's up?  Kenny.  Yeah, I'm with 50 Tom, and I'm with Flavor, and it's got a really big list for us.  Yeah.  We're in a store called Love Shack, Kenny.  Oh, we're losing them because everyone's cheering us.  You're in a store.  It sounded like it's.  Kenny, say that again.  We're in a store called Love Shack, which has all the chips.  Love Shack, which has what?  They're, like, you know, picking their mark on all the chips. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, I wish we could hear them.  Your phone's capping out there, Kenny.  All right.  I've got to buy it up twice like a people phone up.  Yeah, there's a huge, well, they are the rock stars of this event.  Oh, Love Shack, it's called.  Love Shack.  What is it?  And what can you get at Love Shack?  Love Seats.  Oh, Love Seats?  Yeah.  They make a love connection.  Oh, so they're, what, like a couch, like a small couch type of love seat?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They sat on all of them and, you know, locked their territory. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, now it just smells like ass.  Guys, we...  This is an unbelievable scene here.  All right, guys, we haven't prayed in 10 minutes.  Time for another prayer.  Another prayer.  Who wants to lead us in prayer?  God, if you would please hear our prayer and let this come off without a hitch and without  us getting fired.  Thank you, oh Lord and Savior.  All right.  We're heading for FYE because Grey Wolf likes to buy some music. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  FYE, okay.  All right.  For your entertainment, I would gather.  Very good.  Wow.  What is good?  And what does he play it on?  Oh, he's got a CD player?  I think he has some, yeah.  Get him things they could never use, like DVDs.  You know they don't have a DVD player.  Or soap.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  What's up?  All right.  Well, Jose invited Angel into the king-size bed and both of them decided they were going  to take a nap.  Yeah.  And they didn't want to get up.  Jose doesn't want to get up now.  Oh, really?  No, that's going to be a problem.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Give one of them five bucks a drink cleaning solution.  All right.  Oh, we're getting up now.  What do you want to do, man?  What's up?  Shoes.  Angel wants shoes.  All right.  Get him to the shoe store.  All right.  And make him have somebody help measure his feet.  Yeah.  He needs his feet measured for size and width and everything.  All right, E-Rock.  We're going to let you go for a little bit.  All right.  Talk to you in a bit.  Good.  They haven't bought anything yet so far.  No.  They can be very smart shoppers, Ope.  Let's go to Danny.  He's with Tina.  Danny, what's up? 
[01:53:30]  How are you?  Good.  I'm here with Tina.  We're in New York and company, and she's picked out some jeans.  Okay.  And she's looking at some, like a jogging suit kind of thing.  Okay.  Tina, how do you know if those fit?  I think you should try them on.  I know.  My butt ain't that big.  I don't know what she just said, but she seems to be very agitated for some reason.  Wow.  She's homeless.  Well, yeah, probably.  Think of what it would be like for you if someone just dropped you on Mars to walk around.  You'd be a little agitated, too. 
[01:54:00]  And the first place that we brought them to was the mattress store.  Yeah, I know.  We got some good audio from there.  Well, see, now you bring them to the mattress store.  I think Ben is bringing his guys to the bar first.  That's right.  Well, I'm sure we'll get them some drinks, I'm sure.  Danny.  Yeah.  Because we're on the other side of this, obviously.  You've got to set it up for us.  What's the scene over there?  Well, we know that there's different crews that have split up, and we have our own group  of fans with us.  And basically, we're just watching Tina, the homeless lady, just touch everything in the 
[01:54:30]  store.  Let them touch it.  Just touch it.  And the rich shirts, and they go look great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's looking for all.  She's picking out, like, sexy v-necks.  Yeah.  Yeah, sexy stuff.  The salespeople are just absolutely repulsive.  Yeah, it's going to be great out on the street.  We want some of the pests to call on the show.  I want to get their point of view of what's going on over there, too.  Absolutely.  I will have some of my guys give a call.  So we've got a pretty good audience out there?  Absolutely.  I mean, the crowd is absolutely unbelievable. 
[01:55:00]  But no spending yet, huh?  No, they haven't bought anything.  No one's committed.  They're very discerning shoppers.  Discerning.  Yes, yes.  Well, James, our male homeless guy that we have, he's waiting on underwear.  He's not buying a thing until he buys underwear first.  Underwear first.  And then is he going to change them right there?  Well, if he'd like to.  I think he should.  There's probably a bathroom somewhere.  Usually they're near the food court or something where he can go in the food court.  I'll make sure.  Where he can go in and change his underwear. 
[01:55:30]  I will make sure of that.  Yeah.  The food court people are going to complain.  Look, these guys came in.  We made a total of $8 today because everybody else left.  All right.  Thank you, Danny.  All right.  We'll check in with you a little bit.  There goes, Danny.  Let's say hi to Chris in New Jersey.  Things are moving real fast here.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  So this is the third homeless shopping spree.  Wasn't it also the third sex for Sam that got you fired?  Yes.  Good luck, bro.  Your mom's socks.  Oh, no.  Oh, sir. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Andrew in North Carolina.  Andrew.  Yeah, what's up?  This is Hydro.  What's up?  Hey, I was just...  I've only been with you guys for about a year since you came on XM.  I was wondering if you can give us new listeners the outcome of the last shopping spree so we can kind of know what's going on.  They actually went very well.  There were a couple of stores during the first one, I think, that, as they saw the homeless coming, shut the big security gates that they shut when they closed the mall up. 
[01:56:30]  And they were just taunted by our fans when they did that.  All the fans started yelling, let the homeless shop.  Yeah.  Let the homeless shop.  It was quite a scene.  Other than that, they got to shop.  They had a great time.  Some of them got drunk.  That's right.  Let's go back to Ben.  And he's on a carousel with Tippi Tom.  Ben.  Hey, guys.  We've got on the horses on the carousel.  It's me, Gray Wolf, Tippi Tom, and about a hundred of our listeners, and some poor Jewish family that's just mortified. 
[01:57:00]  This is a great mall.  We're having a great time.  Gray Wolf's trying to pull the saddle off the plastic horse because he's an Indian.  He's trying to set the horse free.  Put some paint on his hand and slap the ass.  Now it's his.  Tom's like humping the stupid horse.  It's hilarious.  That's good.  Get him drunk and put him on something that goes round and round.  They throw up.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Has anyone bought anything yet? 
[01:57:30]  Well, my guys haven't.  It's been hard moving around.  There's such a large group of people with us.  So Tippi Tom got some popcorn, but don't give it to him.  Yeah.  He's got popcorn.  Gray Wolf, there's actually a musical instrument shop that we're going to go to next.  Oh.  Okay.  Tell him to put his lips on everything.  Yeah.  Try the woodwind instruments.  Yeah.  Even the guitars.  All right.  Ben, anything else?  Ben?  All right. 
[01:58:00]  I'll go.  I just heard a tackle, and we lost the connection.  Dumb tackle.  Hopefully, it means a homeless fell off his horse.  Ben, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I'm with Rudolph and Santa.  Yeah.  At Stephen Barry's.  And they're getting the hilarious items such as pants and peacoats.  What?  A peacoat.  A new meaning to peacoat when they own one.  And that's what they sell at Stephen Barry's?  Men's clothing?  Yeah.  This is terribly practical right now.  Right. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  That's good for them.  One of our female listeners wants to take one of our homeless guys onto this 4D experience,  which is one of these things where it's like a theater shakes.  Virtual reality where you get in and, oh, absolutely.  This is like taking a caveman into outer space.  Yeah, you've got to do that.  All right.  So we'll try to get one of those hooked up. 
[01:59:00]  I'm not sure if they'll be able to call in from it, but at least we'll get a review.  Yeah.  Afterwards, I want to know what the experience was like for the homeless.  Hey, by the way, a lot of people checking in.  They're just getting off work, and they're going to join everyone else at the Palisades  Center Mall in West Nyack.  Homeless Shopping Spree 2005 is happening as we speak.  And the pests are really living up to their name right now because they're just taking nonstop  flash photography two feet away from my face.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  I can't wait to see the pictures later tonight.  Van, I'm just completely annoyed to be doing this, and that's why I love them. 
[01:59:30]  Yep.  You got it.  All right, Van.  Thanks.  I'll call back, bud.  All right.  Scott in Arizona.  Scott.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good, Scott.  This is absolutely the funniest thing I've ever heard, man.  Well, we have the homeless, and they're shopping at a really nice mall right now in front  of five.  I don't even know how many listeners, but I'm hearing five, six hundred listeners.  Tons of listeners joining in.  That's right.  The festivities.  Scott.  Hey, what's happening?  I'm losing your connection, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm driving. 
[02:00:00]  I'm moving today.  You guys are great.  This is absolutely hysterical.  Loving the show, boys.  Thank you, sir.  And a video of this will be up on Foundry Music maybe later tonight or tomorrow.  Probably tomorrow.  Yeah, probably tomorrow.  Because we've got to do this show, and then we've got to get up to do our morning show  tomorrow.  Jesus.  Do you?  What are you saying, Jimmy?  Something like that.  All right.  I guess we should take a break and let the homeless settle in and start buying shit.  It's the Homeless Shopping Spree 2005 at the Palisade Center Mall in West Nyack.  That's 1000 Palisade Center Drive. 
[02:00:30]  We're live right now.  We usually do mornings, but it's 5.05 on the East Coast right now.  Okay?  P.M.  Yeah.  P.M.  So if that time is matching up right now, you can join us.  Yeah.  If it didn't match up, then this is a replay.  And don't show up there, because you'll look silly.  There you go.  It's the Opie and Anthony 2005 Homeless Shopping Spree.  It's every time I'm going to jerk off.  Live from the Palisade Mall in West Nyack, New York.  You still like to jerk off?  You are, sir.  Get on track. 
[02:01:00]  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts. 
[02:01:30]  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Dice and shirts.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't make a fucking maniac of it. 
[02:02:00]  All right, you're checking out the homeless shopping spree 2005.  Everyone's at the Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack.  If you're just getting out of work, you're close by, you might want to check out the festivities.  Let's say hi to Dave in Jersey. Dave, you're at the mall? 
[02:02:30]  What's up, boys? No, I just left the mall. I got caught up.  I'm actually passing it right now. I got caught up with all the pests out there,  and they smell, they smell like it's fire and cold cuts.  They smell like piss and beer.  Uh, really?  Yeah, this is just, these aren't the people you brought with you.  Just a mess out there today.  Yeah.  It is a mess, and people are horrified.  I got to cut you off, because Big Kev's on the line,  and this is the first we're hearing from Half a Hulk Face.  Half a Hulk Face. Big Kev.  Hey, what's up, guys? I'm with Spoon and Half a Hulk Face, 
[02:03:00]  and we've just purchased some fine Timberlands at Foot Locker.  Oh, and who got those?  Uh, both of the gentlemen got a pair,  and, uh, the crowd was nice enough to chip in and help out,  so they were both able to get a nice new pair of Timberland boots.  Did they get their feet, uh, measured?  Uh, Spoon got his feet measured.  Uh, Half a Hulk Face, uh, didn't deny that.  He said he'll, he'll just risk it.  Yeah.  Just slap it against the bottom of his, uh, foot. 
[02:03:30]  Lord knows what's growing on his foot.  Oh, who knows? Half a Hulk foot.  I'll take a size 8 and a size 16.  So that's the report from the mall.  All right. Thank you, Big Kev.  That's practical, uh, footwear for the winter.  Sure.  Very nice. Very nice.  Let's go to E-Rock.  E-Rock.  They're coming. Relax.  What's wrong?  Problem? Problem, Eric?  I got Jose and Angel in Foot Locker.  Um, we had to get them new socks so we could try on the new shoes.  Yeah.  So he takes his old socks off, right? 
[02:04:00]  And his feet are like, clearly just rust color coming off the socks.  Oh.  Right?  So he starts scraping his feet and flinging it everywhere.  And we're like telling him, no, no, no, don't, don't.  Put the new socks on.  All right?  So he's like, don't touch my feet.  I don't want to touch my feet.  So we got him to put the new socks on before he tries it on the new shoes.  So we're waiting for the shoes to come in.  And they're haggling with the guy saying that the shoes are too expensive.  It's not a fucking marketplace in Calcutta. 
[02:04:30]  It's a fucking mall.  He was trying to get a pair of Nikes for $40.  And he's saying 90 is too expensive, 90 is too expensive.  So we settled on these black pair of New Balance shoes.  I can only imagine these guys, too, because we've talked to all of them before this.  Yeah.  All right, I'll pay $60 and give you a blowjob.  So those are the new shoes?  All right, so the guy at Foot Locker brings out a pair of shoes.  Angel tries on his pair, and he loves them.  He's walking around showing everybody.  Nice. 
[02:05:00]  Jose puts them on.  He looks at it, and then looks at the guy and goes, I need a half a size bigger.  And he throws them off.  Oh, no.  So someone is actually going to have to try on those shoes.  Yeah.  So we got the new pair now.  Jose.  Wait a minute, Eric.  Yeah.  Is there a place that Molly gives pedicures?  It's beautiful.  There should be.  I think we saw a place somewhere back.  We can take them over there.  All right, good.  They want to go to Bath and Body Works next.  Oh, very nice.  I'll get him a pedicure.  There's awful things.  Oh, God. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  So once he's done trying on a Tuesday, we'll take him to get a pedicure.  All right, you're right.  Thank you.  No problem.  Let's go to Danny.  Tina is making her first purchase.  Danny.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, Tina just purchased a nice, quaint little outfit.  And we had a little bit of a cringe moment when she went to pay with the American Express gift card.  The cashier asked for her phone number, and she had to politely explain that she didn't have one.  Oh.  It was kind of sad. 
[02:06:00]  You know.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Maybe for that split second, she was actually a person.  She's paying for it.  She breaks out that Amex.  That's right.  And gives it in.  And then, what, a phone number?  Oh.  Oh, that's right.  This is going to end in a couple of hours.  Yeah, she's actually starting to creep me out, because she's kind of muttering to herself.  Like, she's not talking to anybody, but her mouth is moving, and there's sounds coming out.  Yeah, which she did during our fucking phone call.  Yeah, we didn't get much out of her, so.  Hey, what did she purchase? 
[02:06:30]  She got an outfit.  She got jeans, a shirt, and a pair of panties.  Ooh.  Hot.  Yeah, that's for the old ones.  Usually that sounds hot.  Yeah, get the old ones.  No, thanks.  Peel them off like a fruit roll-up.  Yeah, get the old ones.  We're watching them off.  All right, Danny.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Ben.  He's with Graywolf.  Ben?  Yes.  What's up, Ben?  We are in a, Graywolf and I are in a Native American store, and he is making his first purchase.  What is that called, Graywolf?  Graywolf, what is this that you're buying? 
[02:07:00]  Graywolf.  I don't know.  Now there's another Native American guy greeting Graywolf in there.  We're in a little Indian store.  It's a dream catcher.  He's purchasing a dream catcher.  Oh, a dream catcher.  What is that nonsense?  That's going to be his first purchase.  By the way, we've mortified so many people.  A little late for a dream catcher for him, isn't it?  How about a dream smasher?  It's fucking shaped like a whiskey bottle.  All right, Ben.  You were saying horrifying what?  We've been mortifying.  It's funny. 
[02:07:30]  You see these groups of families, and they'll just look and walk in the other direction.  There was these three 12-year-old girls that saw Tippi Tom, and he's yelling, I'm golden  bones, and they just ran for the hills.  This is a great turnout.  What kind of Indian shop is there in that place?  What's the name of it?  What's the name of your store, sir?  What is it?  Native Spirit.  It's called Native Spirit.  Native Spirit.  This mall really does have everything, doesn't it?  This mall is unbelievable.  Good job to Steve on picking this mall.  Man. 
[02:08:00]  How many of you ever bumped into an Indian store?  Really?  No, it's a good-sized store, too.  It's a large store.  So Graywolf is getting his first purchase, and now we're going to go look at some musical instruments.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Ben.  Okay.  Ben's having a really good time with this.  Let's say hi to Heather at the mall.  Heather?  Hello.  Listen, you know what?  It's a little too quiet here for me.  It really is.  You've got a few people here, a group of people there, but there's nothing much going on.  People are walking around, don't even know what's going on yet. 
[02:08:30]  Well, it's a very big mall.  It is a big mall, but, you know, everyone was supposed to meet at the Ferris wheel.  There was one person on the Ferris wheel.  One real group of you, that was it.  If you want to create something, it's in the food court.  You have everyone get together and get everyone on it at the same time.  And then you're going to...  They met outside, and they're already in shopping.  This woman has no clue what's going on in there.  She just showed up.  Yeah.  Someone has to listen to that every night.  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:00]  She just showed up.  Yeah.  She just showed up.  She went to the Ferris wheel.  No one's there because everyone went their separate ways.  Yeah.  How many stories is this mall?  It's like three or four levels.  Three levels.  Three levels sprawling.  There's a ton of people there.  Just they're not where Heather is.  You think any are going to go to Pottery Barn?  Maybe pick something up from Pottery Barn?  Use all of their money.  Joe in Jersey.  Get them a video game.  Hey, guys.  How we doing?  I want to pony up the credit card here. 
[02:09:30]  Maybe buy a pair of boots or contribute to the group dining experience, perhaps.  Are you at the mall?  No, I'm not at the mall.  I'm on the road.  I figure I owe you one.  You had a weak moment two weeks ago, and you gave me tickets to see Disturbed out at the  Starland.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  So I owe you one.  How was that show?  The show was kick-ass.  Nice.  It was a great show.  Very good.  I think the listeners that are at the mall are really helping out the homeless, so I  appreciate it.  We'll take a rain check on that one.  I'm still looking to make good. 
[02:10:00]  Thanks, guys.  All right, Joe.  I think half a Hulk face ought to hang out by Baby Gap or Children's Place.  Just stand there.  I'm going to see Angel or Jose hang out there.  Whichever guy is more likely to misbehave.  Get Jose at the Children's Store.  Heather.  Yes.  What happened?  Ah, tomorrow you get dead zones.  I hate this damn place.  Yeah, what were you saying, man?  Because you had something good to say.  Let me tell you.  You were great as Sonny's wife, by the way, in Dog Day Afternoon.  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  So, I've been here probably, we knew you were coming.  My husband and I came here about 1.30.  Did a little Christmas shopping, ate a little lunch.  Doing the poor bastards.  Good for you guys.  Right.  Everyone was supposed to, we heard they were going to congregate at the Ferris wheel,  which is closed.  I guess someone got wind of it, so.  Uh-huh.  We figured they'd go, like, to the car.  Oh.  Oh, again, one of those pesky dead spots in the mall she was talking about.  It's a nice one between your ears, you babbling whore.  That poor bastard husband.  I guarantee we get a third out of her.  Oh, yeah, she'll call back.  By the way, we got the news on. 
[02:11:00]  The lines waiting for trains to get out of New York City right now, amazing.  Is that a train they're waiting for?  Yeah, well, the Long Island Railroad, you can still use.  Wait, that's the 59th Street Bridge.  That's the 59th Street Bridge, but they're going to another shot down at Penn Station.  They're like, I don't know, they're almost like 10 people wide,  and the line goes forever to get down into Penn Station to try to leave the city.  You've got to use that bridge later.  Oh, yeah, it's not going to be bad, Ann, by the time you leave at 7.  You might as well just sleep where you're sitting, Ann.  By the time you get home, you're going to have to sleep.  Who are the lucky people that are able to drive there that are moving? 
[02:11:30]  I don't know.  TV people, not radio people.  Damn it.  I get up a notch.  Oh, boy, that's going to be a problem.  But this transit strike in New York, just a complete nightmare tonight for so many people.  All right, let's go to Red the Trucker.  Red, what's up?  What's up, man?  After this little shandig here, man, y'all doing good for XM,  because everybody's going to buy fucking radio now just to see what you guys are up to.  Well, we've got a lot of things that are around the corner for everybody. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, man.  What the fuck?  Forever Bonner.  I think the cold medicine is kicking in.  Starting a kicking on you?  A little bit.  A little bit.  All right, that thorough flu or whatever it's called?  Thorough flu.  Thorough flu?  Opie Voss.  I told you it's kicking in.  Thorough flu.  Thorough flu.  That's when he gives you the flu worse.  The thorough flu?  Holy crap.  I mixed with some Tylenol PM. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  That was not smart.  That was not smart.  All right, we're waiting for some of the guys to call back in.  Let's go to Sean in Jersey.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  Didn't Graywolf's problem start by his consumption of Native Spirits?  I believe so, yes.  And the store was Native Spirits.  A little ironic.  It sure was.  All right.  Not entertaining at all.  Not even a little.  Just ironic.  Ironic in a boring who cares way.  Absolutely. 
[02:13:00]  All right, we got a low on the action here.  Waiting for the guys to call back.  Mm-hmm.  We're getting requests for some of this dumb Christmas stuff, so we'll play one here.

Do you know how depressing that was when we were kicked off the air to listen to it?  Because it just reminded me of the show, that stupid character, the retarded guy with  the mouth moving on the computer.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  It really bummed me out.  Well, there's a lot of DJs across America that play this thing, and they make believe it  was theirs. 
[02:13:30]  This was just something that was on the internet.  Yeah.  Stop trying to make your listeners think that you're creative.  Who did this?  In the public domain.  It was just...  Some guy.  Some guy on the internet.  That's all it was.  I'm pretty sure it was.  There was a show in New York City that claimed that they came up with this.  It's like, no, you didn't.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Here's ding, fries are done.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Okay.  We extended the show for another half hour or so.  Okay.  So call us when you get to the bar, okay?  All right, will do.  All right.  Thanks, E-Rock.  You guys, do it.  We're going to do it.  Get to Kenny.  They're not calling back in right now.  Oh, my God.  The bus is loaded and E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock is still wandering around the mall.  All right.  Who fucking did this to him? 
[03:25:30]  I don't know.  This is the Rolling Stones.  Because I know the guys in the office are laughing their asses off.  This is the Rolling Stones all over again.  E-Rock never got word.  Yeah, please call Kenny immediately and tell him don't call him.  And just ditch him there.  Yeah, we got to take off.  He will be so fucking good.  We got to take off.  Get Kenny or Ben on the line.  Oh, my God.  No.  It's the Rolling Stones show all over again.  Pipe, San Diego, what's up?  Guys, this is such a great show.  I was laughing my ass off so hard. 
[03:26:00]  I was crying.  And I'm sitting on the border.  I'm supposed to be watching for illegals coming across.  I had to turn it off for a little while because I was just afraid somebody was going to get by me.  I was just laughing too damn hard.  It was a great show today.  Nice, Pipe.  We could have let in some terrorists today.  All right.  Someone wants to complain here.  Chris Jersey, what's up?  Hey, great show, guys.  I just wanted to call Jimmy out.  I'm saying Re-Cock the Bat.  Did I say that?  You said Re-Cock, sir.  You could kind of get away with that.  Yeah, Re-Cock the Bat is kind of like, you know, just not literally cock it, but, you know, you cock something back. 
[03:26:30]  I swing bats.  I don't Re-Cock them.  Yeah.  Well, you know what it is.  You know if I cock it up.  Get it all cocked up.  Yeah.  It's just you probably.  No, I've never heard that before.  Get all turned on by the word.  Yeah.  Re-Cocking.  Not cock, but the fact that you can cock again.  You can cock.  It made perfect sense to me.  We've got to get some of the guys on the phone.  Ben and the rest of them.  Let's say hi to Paul on Long Island.  Paul?  Paul Pickles.  Hey, guys, the minute these guys leave that bar, like, fully filled up, they hit that fucking 
[03:27:00]  call there and all have to piss at the same time.  Yeah, I understand that.  Yeah.  It's going to be a nightmare.  It's going to be a nightmare ride back to the city for these guys.  All right, boys.  Punch it up.  All right, Paul.  What is Ben or Kenny?  We're waiting for them to call back.  Do we call them?  Huh?  Do we call them?  We're trying to call them.  We're trying, but...  Do you hear how fun, like, E-Rock's having a great time?  Yeah.  We're up on the fourth floor, like, he's as far away from the bus as possible. 
[03:27:30]  We're here on the fourth.  We're on the roof.  Yes.  You know, the door's shut behind us and locked, but we're having a good time.  Like, he has no clue that that fucking bus is leaving.  He has no clue we're about to leave him at the mall with two homeless people.  Oh, my God.  This will be the most pissed off person you're ever, ever going to hear.  Who do you got on the phone?  But he doesn't listen or pay attention.  No.  It's his own fault.  Ben.  Ben.  Hey.  We just left Eric at the mall. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock is at the bar.  Oh, good.  Well, he's going to have a nice time.  He's going to reminisce about the Stones concert, Giant Stadium, when you and I said fuck them  and left them.  Yeah.  We told him to just go up to the bar that everyone's hanging out up there, so he's headed  that way.  We didn't tell him you guys were leaving.  Oh, good.  We're all on the bus, and we are pulling out of the mall.  They're pulling out.  Let me tell you something.  Danny and Nathaniel couldn't be happier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they could be if they were Derek and fucking Travis. 
[03:28:30]  And Sam's back there, too.  They're laughing their asses off.  Yeah, well, it's his own fault.  He doesn't listen.  Fuck him.  He doesn't pay attention.  It's like the show is going to be over in...  Ten minutes.  Yeah.  Ten minutes.  And the guy is like, well, we're here on the fourth floor.  Not knowing.  Doesn't he know how these shows work?  We like wrapping things up.  Like, get them on the bus, and they're gone, and maybe a little conversation from the bus,  and the show's over.  It finishes.  We're extending in a half hour. 
[03:29:00]  Poor Eric.  But he didn't even...  You didn't even have to say that, and he still would have been, well, we're hanging out.  Like, look at your fucking watch.  We always go for the perfect ending.  The bus fades away, and so it's a show for the day.  It's like a story.  It needs a beginning, a middle, and an ending.  And he's just wandering around.  Ben, did you guys pull out already?  Yeah, we're almost out of the mall.  We're out of the mall parking lot, and we're about to go through a light and, like, get  on to the...  Oh, so you're actually driving.  Oh, yeah, dude.  Oh, my God.  This is not a radio bit.  This guy is fucking going to shit. 
[03:29:30]  This is what these guys do.  Go, go, go, go.  Here's his roommate trying to get on.  Go.  We don't know who that is.  Go, go, go, go.  He's a stupid roommate.  Who?  Did you call it the wrong bus?  Go, go.  Wrong bus?  Dude, they're ditching people.  It's his roommate.  Don't say a child bluster.  Here he comes.  Hey, man, sorry.  We didn't realize that was you.  It's all good.  Yeah.  It's going to be all good when Eric finds out we fucking left him.  You don't give a fuck about him? 
[03:30:00]  Hey, I'll be jacked up.  Did you let the roommate on the bus?  Yeah, unfortunately, yeah.  That's fine.  He doesn't even realize that Eric's not even on the bus.  How did he find your bus?  Where are you?  Dude, he...  Listen, his roommate came running up, and we're pulling away.  And we just pulled right away.  We pulled away, and he chased us halfway across the fucking mall.  So, halfway across the parking lot, so...  The fun part is bend your shell.  Don't open the door.  We don't know who that is.  Yeah.  We don't know.  Keep going.  Yeah, yeah.  Go. 
[03:30:30]  Nice work, Lou.  Go, hang on.  Go, go, go.  Going to Manhattan?  And guys, we're taking, we're going through the light, and we are off.  It is fucked.  You know what the funny thing is, is like, you know, so many of the guys on the staff, it's  like, if this was Derek and Nathaniel wouldn't let it happen, or if it was Danny, Nathaniel  wouldn't let it happen, but it's Eric, and they all just hate him, so, you know.  Holy shit.  I think it was funny when Ben said a minute ago, fuck him, and he meant it. 
[03:31:00]  Wait, let's go to Sarge from Whackbag.  Sarge.  Yeah, the court of the day has to go to Ben when that patrol car was behind the bus, and  he goes, this is legal, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  Very good.  All right, let's go to Jay in Connecticut.  Jay.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Happy birthday to each other, cheese.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, I'm a jock up here in Connecticut, and this is fucking radio gold.  All right, well, feel free to take it. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, no, dude, dude, I'm not going to steal it from me.  You guys are like, this is the reason why radio on XM is...  Oh, B.  I knew that was coming.  Thank you, sir.  That was nice.  Can we get Iraq on the phone?  With Ben.  Is Ben, he still here?  Yeah, I'm here.  Would you be afraid to tell Iraq where you are?  No, not at all.  All right, go.  We'll put him together.  All right, we'll get an Iraq on the line, hopefully.  Hey, Eric. 
[03:32:00]  He's not on yet.  Jesus.  Hold on, Ernest.  Look how eager he is to fuck him over, man.  That was the operator.  That whole bus cheering.  They're all psyched.  They're all like, fuck it.  Look.  They're all just like...  All right, let's go to Russell as we get Eric on the phone.  Russell.  Hey, how you doing?  Good, Russell.  What's up?  All right, I learned that O&A are the true pioneers of radio, and the cashiers at O&A have  to use their Brazil nuts to ring up sales on the cash register.  Oh, yeah.  What's going on?  Very good, buddy.  All right.  There was a lot of great lines. 
[03:32:30]  I like the high-line line myself.  I like that line a lot.  I found it to be racist and insensitive.  Me too.  Huh?  Why, 7th?  We got Iraq on the line.  Iraq.  Yo.  Where are you, buddy?  We're on the bus.  He just fucking got on the bus.  Oh, man.  How did...  How the fuck did that happen?  I don't know, dude.  We're fucking, like, on the...  Iraq.  Iraq.  Yeah.  Ben was going to leave you.  Yeah, I'm sure it was Ben. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  We said, look, man, you can't leave Iraq.  He works hard for the show, and Ben's like, fuck Iraq.  Well, yeah, the show's going at 7.30.  I buy that.  Yeah.  That might have been his cue to run out the door.  Well, how did you get back to the bus?  I bet it took off.  According to Ben, you guys were fucking over the GW.  It was way outside the wall.  I don't know how to find him.  I get credit.  He found us.  But this is exactly what he's almost done.  What's happening?  He...  Yeah, we were...  We were completely out of the parking lot. 
[03:33:30]  We were pretty much on, like, the beginning of the highway to get out of the place, and  he found us.  He didn't run it up.  I bet there was this creepy roommate that told us where we were.  No, I didn't.  All right, listen.  Listen, we've got to wrap this up.  So, any observations from you guys?  Best Homeless Champions Free Ever.  Best Homeless Champions Free Ever.  Who said that?  I said...  Can we get the interior light bulb?  Are you guys on a speakerphone?  We can't hear you, really.  No, we're here.  It's just hard to hear with the delay.  Ah, so, E-Rock, what's your observations? 
[03:34:00]  Shut up, Danny.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Hey.  It was fun.  Why are you out of breath?  Running for the bus, Kenny.  Thanks, guys.  All right, pass the phone.  Yeah, pass the phone around.  Sidecar.  Kenny.  Hello?  There he is.  You got the phone?  Yeah, I got the phone now.  All right.  Any observations?  It's hard to hear you.  It's hard to hear us.  All right, everyone... 
[03:34:30]  No, I hear you now.  Everyone have a good time?  Yeah, I tell you, it's indescribably for words.  What went on there?  Yeah.  All right.  And the listeners had a good time.  They got a lot of video and pictures they're going to send to us.  Yeah, it was incredible.  The way everybody was shopping and the way everybody was walking around.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  It was an overwhelming experience.  Ask the homeless if they had a good time.  Hey, did you both have a good time? 
[03:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Terrible.  Yeah.  All the tippy-ton was there since we were the homeless.  Yeah.  Any time, like, music was playing, they did good.  And, Kenny, there were no problems?  No, everybody was very orderly.  The security left you alone?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I stalked them.  I charmed them a little bit.  The cops up here were terrific.  They're big fans of the show.  It was just that state trooper that was driving to come out.  I had his nuts in a knot. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Anybody else have anything?  I don't know.  E-Rock, you want to talk some more?  I don't get it.  He's got to catch his breath.  Catch it and lock it.  I'll call you in a few minutes and I'll thank you.  All right.  Yeah, we're running out of show, so call back before we leave.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe I want to play Spillin' the Bottle with that homeless broad.  Eat it.  All right, there, Kenny.  Thanks, Kenny.  Cool.  Let's say hi to Dan in Virginia.  Dan? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I got what I learned.  Oh, yeah.  Let's play that.  Yeah.  What smells worse, the homeless, Vic Kev's fat skin, or E-Rock's breast?  Oh.  Punching out.  Wow.  That's going to hurt.  Oh, boy.  Ken in Florida.  Yo, ONA.  Jimmy, I love you, brother.  Hey, I learned that niggers were bought by farmers.  Oh, guys.  Sure.  Woo!  That's not how it was said.  No.  Doug in Ohio.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[03:36:30]  Happy birthday.  Dude, this is going to go down in history.  It's probably the funniest fucking show that I have ever heard in my life.  Bless you, Anthony.  God bless you.  Oh, my gosh.  All right.  Thank you.  Tell your friends about the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, man.  I already have, man.  Three subscribers already.  I'm not in Mansfield.  What a prick, Opie.  Let me know.  No mistake about it.  Hoo-hoo.  ONA are back.  You guys fucking rock.  All right.  Coming soon to the show, our betting show.  Yes.  We just got to figure out more bets with the people that are around us. 
[03:37:00]  We really haven't figured out some good.  We haven't figured out good ones yet, have we?  Well, the one Tourette's one is, you know, not started at all.  That's the biggie.  But now we want to build a whole show around that.  Other bets.  Other bets that we could do with, like, Big A and Starker Patty and No Filter Paul.  Maybe some new people we can dig up.  Maybe new people, sure.  Yeah.  And it's going to be high-stakes betting on the show in the very near future.  You can play along at home, as well.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Go.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Thanks. 
[03:37:30]  What I learned today was homeless shopping spree equals homeless happy hour.  Cool.  More H's.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Bernie in Montana.  Bernie?  Hey, guys.  For some inexplicable reason, everybody at the Opie and Anthony show hates E-Rock.  Yeah.  I like E-Rock.  I like E-Rock, too.  Of course.  Well, he's Hawk to me.  He's E-Rock to everyone else.  I like E-Rock.  I don't love him, but I like him.  My girlfriend likes E-Rock.  My family likes E-Rock.  Of course.  He's a genuine article.  He really is. 
[03:38:00]  He's as stupid as you think he is.  Who's going to count down the show without him?  We could just be talking, and the show's going to shut off.  Anyone can put their hand up at the wrong time.  What's so hard about that?  When there's eight seconds left, put up 13 fingers.  And that's whose job?  Travis.  We're going to have to get into the whole E-Rock thing and see why these people don't  like him.  I don't know, either.  Where did that come from?  I like the E-Rock.  Is it jealousy?  The guy works really hard.  Maybe because he's in his late 20s, and he still dresses and looks like he's four. 
[03:38:30]  Let's go to Ryan in Philly.  Ryan.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I learned that Big Cat smells as bad as the homeless and doesn't know it.  I wish I could quit you.  All right.  Oh, boy.  So we've got to do a show tomorrow morning?  Yeah.  That's going to be fun.  This is like bedtime now.  I don't mind.  I'm usually in bed.  I'm going to go eat with little Jimmy Norton.  Want to go eat?  Okay.  Do you want to go eat, Ant, and let the traffic... 
[03:39:00]  Let the traffic what?  Traffic ain't going away.  You can't go at 7 o'clock.  You're nuts.  Traffic ain't going to go away.  He's just going to deal with it, right?  Trudge it out.  It's going to be sidewalks and medians the whole way.  Dude, you're going to hit...  We should give him a recorder.  Can you record yourself?  No, I'm too exhausted.  You don't even have to curse.  You can just go, here it is, and this is where I am at this time.  So we know you are.  It doesn't have to be funny.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  It'd be interesting to hear tomorrow morning how it took you nine hours to get home.  What you're going to do is go home, shit, wipe your crack, and get back in the truck. 
[03:39:30]  Pretty much it.  Fuck.  Thanks.  You need an assist from the NYPD tomorrow morning.  Oh, I need an escort.  You definitely need something.  I hear you.  Well, because we got a transit...  We got a transit strike here in New York City.  The deal is before five...  After five in the morning, you have to have four people in your car to come into the New  York City.  Between 5 a.m. and 11 a.m., you need four people in your car to come, not only come  into the city. 
[03:40:00]  There are, like, major roads, the expressway, the BQE, like all roads outside in Queens and  Brooklyn, parts of the Belt Parkway that you're not allowed on.  They throw you out, turn you around.  I wouldn't turn around.  I'd fucking tell them I'm going through.  I have something in my trunk.  Let's not get into it.  Then they'll go, okay, sir.  We didn't need to.  You go through, sir.  They were interviewing some silly people that had no idea the strike was going on today.  That's what I couldn't believe.  I don't know how many people I saw going, I got to the tunnel and they said, you got 
[03:40:30]  to turn around.  And I'm like, what?  I'm watching TV going, who did know?  I'll be honest, dude.  I wouldn't have known either if I wasn't in the 21st century with some sort of technology.  Something.  Anything.  You could be in the 1800s and have their technology.  It's called newspapers on the streets.  It's a neighbor.  Extra, extra.  Anything.  Extra, extra.  Strike.  Excuse me, stupid big A. 
[03:41:00]  Could you not just have half your face on the screen, you psychopath?  Does that look frightening?  What a fucking kook he looks like.  It's half his head.  And it's still bigger than everyone else's whole head.  Yeah.  By the way, people are trying to figure out this webcam thing that you decide to set up  out of nowhere.  Oh.  It's a little underground.  It's a little underground right now.  It's a little underground right now.  You got to kind of know somebody.  Papa Gulash is fucking his cat as we speak.  See, it's not just people being able to look into us.  We could pop up their little cameras.  And now some girl is taking the cat away. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, and we just popped one up here, and you can kind of see what's going on.  And I fell in love with a gal.  Yes.  Hey, do you got one for the office for tomorrow?  Yeah.  We're going to set one up in the office as we're sitting around just preparing for the  show.  Yeah.  And then we'll leave the camera on so you can just see Ben staring at his computer for  four straight hours when we're doing the show.  Highlighting text.  Highlighting text, and then clicking off of it, and highlighting it again.  Talking into his cell phone, it's upside down.  A webcam coming to the office in the very near future.  Let's go to Jim in Illinois. 
[03:42:00]  Jim, what's up?  Hey, I want to say happy birthday, little Jimmy.  And I lurked at $300 buys you a punch in the face by midnight.  There's the end of show music.  Chris in Cleveland.  What's up, Chris?  Yeah, I learned today that Bum Joby had an appearance at the mall.  That was the highlight, I think.  I can't wait to see that video clip.  A lot of video is going to go up on opianthony.com.  Pictures are going to be sent in by the listeners.  We should have some great stuff to check out later on today or tomorrow. 
[03:42:30]  Jason in Ohio.  Jason.  Yeah, we're going to need to start praying to God.  All right.  What are you guys looking at?  Titties.  They have to be 34 double Ds.  Titties on the screen.  Are those 34 double Ds?  Holy mackerel, are they fantastic.  34 double Ds?  No?  You want to type in what they are?  36D.  What are they?  36Ds.  Yep.  36D.  She sure showed them. 
[03:43:00]  I'll say.  They were fucking hefty looking ones.  Oh, people are saying hi to Opie, who's finally peeked around the corner.  Yeah.  We're going to get a couple of cameras in here, so we're going to get a couple of different views.  Yeah.  We should get one from under the desk, so you can fucking view clear stuff leaking down my  socks as I look at that big rack.  Oh, look.  Holy shit.  Those are fantastic.  Oh, would I like to take her out for a cappuccino.  Oh, look.  We got another one up top.  Look at the size of that tit. 
[03:43:30]  That's Big A's head.  Someone's got to dig up Big A's yard.  He looks like a real, real problem.  Look at that.  Not even an expression change.  No.  Like a fucking large Asian.  I think we're out of here.  How many seconds we got left?  Yeah.  We don't even know?  No.  Steve, can you take the waffle pens out of your car?  That's what Eric does.  Let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  I learned today that the pests smell like pissing beer.  You, you, you, you. 
[03:44:00]  You're punching out.  All right.  I want to thank everybody that helped us out with the homeless shopping spree.  Keith the Cops, Sidecar Kenny, a bunch of other guys that don't want their names said.  And alcohol.  For causing the people to be homeless to begin with.  Don Wicklund, Steve, and the rest of the gang here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  See you tomorrow morning.  The Opie and Anthony.  Program complete. </pre>
