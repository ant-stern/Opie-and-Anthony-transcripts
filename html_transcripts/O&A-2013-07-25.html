<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast live from a Montreal conference room during the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival, was a chaotic and highly offensive affair.  The show opened with an over-the-top introduction that the hosts later deemed humiliating.  The initial focus was on the disastrous travel experiences of the crew: the "radio wizard" forgot his passport, while Roland’s plane seat and hotel room were both double-booked, leading to subpar accommodations and a frustrating restaurant search despite his alleged research. E-Rock remained largely solitary throughout the trip.  Jim Norton’s exceptionally potent flatulence on the plane was a recurring comedic point, as was Troy’s altercation with a waitress over the US dollar exchange rate.  The hosts peppered their commentary with jokes targeting Canadians, their fitness levels, and their judicial system, along with observations about Montreal’s street life, including homeless individuals and sex workers, and a fleeting discussion of the FLQ.  Joe DeRosa, a frequent guest, discussed his Montreal experiences and the reactions to a new tattoo, a recurring joke throughout the show.  A caller advertising barcode scanners briefly interrupted the proceedings.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of a purported "naked breakfast" at a diner, which quickly devolved into a running gag about a spilled bowl of oatmeal and Zito's refusal to clean it up.  A phone call with Sal, a staff member in the New York studio tasked with retrieving a sound clip, led to sexually suggestive speculation about his interactions with the interns (three, including one male).  The hosts openly discussed their preferences regarding female interns.  In-studio guests included Joe DeRosa, with anticipation building for Bob Kelly, who was simultaneously recording his podcast, "Bobby from the Lobby," in the hotel lobby.  The hosts recounted a previous night's altercation with Kelly involving cigarettes.  Denny, a New York staff member, called in to offer audience engagement advice.  Further guests included Jesse Joyce (who discussed his felony DUI preventing past Canadian appearances), Tom Papa, and several others.  A female audience member performed a downward-facing dog yoga pose at the hosts' request, and extended banter occurred with a Toronto couple, Chris and Denise, about their relationship and careers in finance.

The show’s chaotic nature continued with the arrival of more guests, including Chris DiStefano and Bob Kelly. DiStefano’s size became a source of jokes, alongside discussions of the comedians' unhealthy lifestyles on tour.  Bob Kelly's intoxicated behavior the previous night was also a major topic.  The conversation devolved into insults, personal anecdotes, and revelations of DiStefano's father's criminal past and DiStefano's own history of violence. Kurt Metzger’s appearance prompted discussion of his controversial rape joke, leading to a vulgar conversation about varying legal interpretations of rape, graphic descriptions of gender reassignment surgery, Anthony Weiner’s sexting scandal, and personal sexual anecdotes.  A photographer interrupted, and a young child was present in the studio.  The discussion also briefly touched on a Chris Rock movie and Bloody Marys as a breakfast cocktail.

A later segment began with a nonsensical discussion of dim sum, inexplicably transitioning to the ethnicities of the *M*A*S*H* cast.  Tom Papa, a guest, was repeatedly urged to leave for another commitment—a purported interview about a horse with a Canadian.  His departure made way for John Mulaney’s first appearance on the show. The show then spiralled into more ribald jokes and insults directed at guests and crew, including a persistent photographer repeatedly accused of trying to photograph the hosts' corneas.  Jim Norton and other unnamed comedians also appeared.  Topics included the comedians' opinions of each other, John Mulaney's upcoming wedding and his reluctance to discuss a prenuptial agreement, and more of Joe DeRosa’s regrettable tattoos. The segment concluded with plugs for the comedians' festival appearances.

The final segment focused on the hosts’ frustration with their scheduling within the Just for Laughs festival.  They expressed their disappointment, using highly offensive language, about their inability to book Amy Schumer.  They complained about being scheduled last for an internally-referred-to-as "dating show," even suggesting a humorous, albeit extreme, solution involving protests to secure a better time slot.  The show concluded with mentions of a repeat broadcast time and the upcoming Ron and Fence Show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Continental dominance has been achieved.  Through sheer force of gas and profanity,  Canada submits to a comedic monster 
[00:00:30]  like it's never seen before.  Jizz and shit jokes from a different location than usual.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh my goodness!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  What a dramatic open!  What a dramatic open that was! 
[00:01:00]  It's amazing!  We sound important!  Oh my goodness!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  You know how important!  I gotta tell ya!  We're in the back and they're like  Oh my God!  Club Soda Kenny isn't here to introduce you guys!  I go, why does everything have to be over the top?  Can't we just go out there and do a radio show? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah!  Apparently that intro was so long, we're done.  Thank you!  Yeah!  I hope you enjoyed it!  Wow!  That was humiliating!  It really was!  And you would know!  I know!  I certainly would!  It's so nice to be embarrassed without a dress and a dick under it.  We're in a conference room.  Broadcasting live for the first time in Canada and from a conference room.  From a conference room.  This is a first for us.  I don't think we ever broadcast from a conference room, but this is nice.  They kind of did everything up pretty nicely, right? 
[00:02:00]  I like the sweet couches.  Yeah, we got guest couches.  Do we have guests?  We got lots of friends.  I wouldn't call them guests.  They're friends.  Are they friends?  So we could treat them like shit?  Yeah, we could have done this show in New York.  It's all the same guys we do.  It's the same schlubs, Bob Kelly, Joe DeRosa, Tom Papa, and there's a few others on there.  Everyone on the show today is from New York.  Every single comic we have.  Really?  Yeah.  So we're not really getting the local flavor?  No, not at all.  Yeah, that's fantastic. 
[00:02:30]  Well, you know, it's always good to have close friends by when you're so far from home.  Yeah, that's good.  It's always good to have close friends by when you can't get other guests.  It's our go-tos.  Yeah, yeah.  The go-to guest.  It's so weird to see these.  We've never seen these guys before.  No.  Usually when we broadcast live, we always know half the audience.  The usual suspects.  The usual people come by.  Stalker Patty.  Mm-hmm.  Bobo.  Yeah.  All the usual, I don't know, everybody on the outset here just kind of looking, everyone 
[00:03:00]  looks pretty normal.  I know.  It's kind of creepy.  Which is weird.  They seem like nice people.  Yeah.  We're not used to being in front of nice people.  The one guy looks like the guy who lopped off that head in Vancouver.  It could be.  He's out, apparently.  I love this Canadian judicial system.  Ah, you cut a head off and ate half of it.  Sure.  But I'm better now.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Carry on.  You're free to go.  Here's some free health care.  Yeah.  I got to say another thing. 
[00:03:30]  You know, no taking shots at my home nation, but you do seem to be in a little better shape  than Americans.  Holy fuck.  What a bunch of fat slobs we got over there.  This crowd could kick the ass out of our New York crowd.  That's for sure.  You think so?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  And we have one girl.  Great.  Oh, wait.  Two girls.  Maybe three.  Four.  Four.  Okay.  Five.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  This could be a new record.  Five girls.  Great.  That's five times the old record.  Oh, that's good. 
[00:04:00]  It's kind of weird to have so many guys like you, isn't it?  It's so creepy.  Oh, it's fucking a dream come true.  All right.  Do we have to watch what we say?  Apparently, things are hate crimes up here.  I don't know.  Hey, gay guys tend to speak with a lisp.  Blah!  Put him in Canadian prison.  Yes.  Where he'll be turned gay.  Yeah.  I'm sure we'll be chatting with some of you lovely people.  A little later.  Yeah.  Jimmy did a set last night.  Yeah, I did. 
[00:04:30]  How was it?  It was delightful.  I went to the comedy just year old.  They have the, it's in the old hockey arena.  What's it called?  The AMC.  And you walk in and it's literally like walking into a hockey arena where they have center ice.  That's cool.  It's kind of, they have old seats from the old stadium are still there.  And you feel like you're in a gutted arena except there's a movie theater and there's  different like little venues and bars.  And it was very, it was very, very cool.  And I went on last, which is always good because when you get there at 730, you never want to 
[00:05:00]  go on before 930.  Always better to sit there for two hours and listen to everybody else's fucking trollery.  Trollery.  But it was, you know, everybody's warming up for TV sets.  So it was, it was good to do and then come back and I called Sam when I got back to  the Hyatt.  I'm like, what am I going to do?  Yeah.  And I, wow.  You must've been like out of people to call.  Yeah.  Believe me, Sam was not first on the list.  Sam was fucking way down.  Yeah.  Did you go out?  Did you do anything fun?  No, I didn't.  I went to the Hyatt and Sam and I milled about outside. 
[00:05:30]  Saw nobody because it was fucking 1030.  Like two old ladies were looking for the party.  Hey shithead, it's a festival.  It starts at one o'clock.  Everybody's out doing shows.  So I just went back to my hotel and went to bed.  Yeah, I was trying to figure out what jerked off.  I was trying to figure out where everybody was too.  Well, they were, Sam, Sam, Troy and Roland were wandering around bothering the locals.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why wouldn't your mic work?  There it is.  Oh, there it is.  We were going to restaurants and Troy, every restaurant I went to was me, Troy, Roland, 
[00:06:00]  and Mark Zito.  Who's Mark Zito?  He's some guy they sent.  I don't even know why he's here.  Well, yeah.  Why are you here, Mark Zito?  That's a good question.  I don't know.  You like file papers for Scott Greenstein, right?  Oh.  So why are you here?  Are you like spying on us?  Customarily, I set up signage, but somebody else already did that.  So you're here to hang posters?  Yeah.  You're the official poster hanger. 
[00:06:30]  Holy shit.  And they got someone else to do it.  That's the heartbreak.  Yeah.  And as we talk about why Mark Zito is here in Montreal, we want to say hi to Sal, who's  back in New York.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  Sal wasn't able to.  Well, he's still an intern, so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Technically.  Oh, we should start with getting here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We should start from the beginning.  First, I got to just say, though, did you tell Zito what I said in the airport yesterday?  No.  When he was walking by, I said, who is that?  And they're like, oh, it's Mark Zito.  I'm like, oh, that's right. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  I still have no clue who you are when you walk around the hallways or anything like that.  Because he doesn't do anything important.  No.  He's not exactly an impact player.  No.  He is one of those guys that Sirius could just fire and there'd be no adverse effect whatsoever.  Him and the dude.  He's right there.  He's right there.  I know.  We're talking right to his face.  He's sitting right there.  Him and the dude from the morning mashup, we just don't know those two people.  And we see him every day.  They hang out together.  And we see him every day.  Very strange.  It just becomes a vacuum when they hang out together. 
[00:07:30]  There's nothing.  There's nothing happening.  Are you saying that they're like matter and anti-matter?  Yeah.  So last we left you, we did a radio show, then we had to get to the airport.  All of us except one person.  Who?  He's here.  Jesus.  Oh, right, right.  That was great.  Which nickname do you want to use?  We should introduce him to the audience.  Yeah.  Everybody kind of knows you as the radio wizard.  There's the radio wizard. 
[00:08:00]  Just a couple of shots.  Just raises his glasses.  He's like, oh, great.  Fucking Zimmerman looked happy sitting there.  You're officially going to be abused in two countries now.  So enjoy.  He forgot his passport.  That's the headline.  We're all at the station.  We're very excited to go.  We all got our stuff, our bags, and of course the passports that you need to leave the country,  go into another country.  And the only person that forgot their passport was the radio wizard. 
[00:08:30]  The only person that forgot his passport was the guy who was there to remind everybody to remember their passport.  Right, right, right.  So then you had to go through this whole rigmarole of buses, planes, trains.  What the hell were you doing to get back to your house?  Two extra buses and two extra taxis.  How did you realize you forgot it?  I know that that's a panic.  At least you weren't at the airport.  What happened?  I got to give Kenny credit.  I was looking through his list of when we were getting picked up and the word on the top, passports. 
[00:09:00]  And I'm like, holy shit, I don't have my passport.  You didn't even think about it.  You had to be reminded.  So did you realize you forgot it or did you look through your bag?  Oh, no.  I knew right away.  Did you panic a little bit?  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  You got a good ribbing all the way to the airport.  Oh, my God.  Everybody.  I'm sure it won't have ended then.  Oh, we destroyed you.  We should have taped it.  Oh, it was a treat.  Well, that was the thing, too.  He had left his luggage at the office because he wanted to leave the office and come back. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  We didn't keep the van for 30 seconds to see if he was going to get there on time or not.  No.  We realized that if we saw you in the rearview mirror pulling your luggage away, we would have just kept going.  Wasn't there on time.  And Roland was having a good laugh about the whole thing.  Yeah, he was.  He called, is this too inside?  He called Rob Cross to see if you left the luggage there.  And when he found out you did, he laughed hysterically.  Where is Roland?  He's here. 
[00:10:00]  Roland had his own difficulties.  Yeah, it's kind of karma.  Not just at the airport.  Apparently, they just sold his seat on the plane.  Yeah.  They were like, yeah, no, we sold that seat.  He's like, oh, but I have a seat.  And they were like, we don't understand you.  Yeah, they called him for help.  We have Charlie Brown's teacher here.  And then he gets to the Hyatt, and they sold his hotel room. 
[00:10:30]  Do you know that?  Yeah, I found that out later.  He has a sofa bed in a closet somewhere.  Isn't that like Best in Show when they didn't have the room?  They put him in a utility closet.  Yeah, so Roland is on a fold-out bed in some room that isn't really a room in the hotel.  Yeah, and he posted a Vine last night.  And it appears that his room is positioned directly over the entire festival.  Because it's just rumbling with music all night long. 
[00:11:00]  Where is he?  I think he's getting the food.  Of course he is.  Right.  Really?  Just a bunch of empty containers.  I know, it happened.  It fell.  The dog ate it.  He asked my goat to hold it.  No, I think he's in the second half of his suite.  Like, you know, a lot of times a suite will have the bedroom.  And it's got a connecting room.  And I'll bet you that that's what they did, is they gave him the connecting room.  The connecting room off a suite?  Me and Kenny had that once in a hotel room. 
[00:11:30]  It was terrible.  Yeah, it was really hot.  Yeah.  Me and a cadaver.  I'll sleep on the floor.  Yeah, Kenny couldn't make it.  He said he woke up this morning, and the first thing he felt was that bar under the mattress,  like in the middle of the fold-away bed, stabbing him in the back.  This thing's a ruthless thing.  But he is collecting vouchers, so that's good.  Yeah, he is.  What did he get, $800 from Air Canada?  Yeah.  He's got all the perks.  He got $800 because Air Canada sold his seat. 
[00:12:00]  And then I think he's getting like $50 worth of food vouchers for the hotel.  Yeah, $50 a night in room service.  He's doing all right.  That's appetizers for him.  Yeah.  You get $50 in the Hyatt.  Woo-hoo.  Look out.  He gets even more obnoxious when he gets hungry, by the way, because we were all walking St.  Catherine for a while, and he starts yelling at everybody.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, and he walked into a guardrail and hit himself in the testicles.  Which was hilarious.  He walked into a guardrail.  Yeah, he just walked into it.  He was yelling.  He was being extremely obnoxious, and then he took a ball shot. 
[00:12:30]  But then he was leading us to a restaurant, which he had no idea where it was, and he  decided that if he acted like a local, people would help him with directions.  So he started walking up to people with a map in hand and going, oh, bonjour.  Where is this place?  Bonjour.  He can't speak English, never mind fucking French.  Listening to Roland yesterday.  Did you guys hear Roland yesterday planning his – he was talking about the restaurants  up here and the great food, and he has this list of places he wants to go.  And I realized he looks at going to a place for food the way I look at it for sex or 
[00:13:00]  the way some guys would look at it for bars.  Like, he plans out – that's part of his thing is the fucking –  He's a foodie.  There's the meat place.  I'm like, who gives a fuck?  Meat place.  Meat place is everywhere.  But yeah, Troy was bummed out, though, because we walked up to an old stuffy Italian joint.  Remember that?  Yeah, it was awful.  It looked like we're –  I'm like, Roland, really?  All the research you did about Montreal and you take us here?  Oh, it's the best place you've ever been.  He's like, well, I didn't really schedule out tonight.  Tomorrow's the big night.  A lot of times you hang out with Roland and you realize that the research that he says 
[00:13:30]  he's been doing has been grossly overstated.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's a horrible traveler.  Horrible.  Horrible.  He's the single worst independent traveler I've ever been with.  But I must say he does take adversity well because he didn't freak out at the airport  or anything.  They don't give a fuck.  And I hear tell that he didn't even freak out when they said he didn't have a room.  They gave Zito a room and they checked in at the same time.  Oh, God.  Do they even know that he does nothing? 
[00:14:00]  I don't think they know who he is.  Nobody does.  Roland doesn't freak out until he won't take some obscure guest.  He did season three of The Office.  He played the male guy.  And then he breaks down and cries and bites somebody's face in the studio.  Just as long as we take his dumb guests.  But he does handle it well.  He didn't freak out at the airport.  You're right.  He was like just kind of sitting there.  I'd have lost my mind.  Whatever, you know.  If I walked up to the fucking counter and they told me I didn't have a seat on the plane,  I'd be losing my mind.  Yeah, of course.  And he's just like, oh, well.  We can't talk to Roland, so we should talk to E-Rock. 
[00:14:30]  E-Rock's here, too.  Ah, the E-Rock.  Hello.  Good morning.  You're hiding.  No.  Just stay another way.  Oh, you can tell.  Let them see your face.  They've never seen you.  People have never seen the E-Rock.  That's E-Rock.  That's E-Rock.  See, he's not really that fat.  He's not really that fat.  He's not really that fat.  By American standards, he's spelt.  Very thin.  E-Rock's mysterious when we hit the road.  No one really saw him yesterday.  We were all walking around.  Oh, you saw him, Travis?  That's Travis, by the way.  Travis. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  What an ovation for Dr. Gay.  Exactly what I deserve.  Wow.  Yeah, we saw, well, me and my wife saw Eric last night.  He was walking around by himself.  Oh, sweetie.  Oh, no.  How sad.  Why, E-Rock?  No, it was fine.  I walked around, checked out the festival.  It was great.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You like that?  We bother you that much, huh?  A little.  A little.  He's a loner.  He really is.  We offered to, you know, come to dinner with us, and he's like, no, I'm just going to walk  around.  Oh, man. 
[00:15:30]  What's going on?  What did you see last night, E-Rock?  All the street performers that are right outside the hotel here.  They had some concert with a black French comedian.  There was like 3,000 people out there going nuts, but they had no idea what he was talking  about.  And then came back, went to bed.  Oh.  Roland.  Ah, there's Roland.  There's Roland.  He's got his fingers in your food.  Hey, Roland.  We'll get back to you, Rock, in a second.  Roland, food in hand.  What's up, Roland?  Thank you.  I just stole your oatmeal.  What?  From the buffet. 
[00:16:00]  Oatmeal.  What is this?  He stole your oatmeal from the buffet.  What the fuck is this?  That's great.  He's got his bare fingers in the bowl.  It's like a Paddington bear.  All right.  Thank you.  What the fuck is it?  Thank you, Roland.  We were talking about your room.  This is, by the way, this is the same meal they served in the boat in Roots.  How fucking awful does this look?  We're not eating this.  We're not eating this, Roland.  That's fucking...  Thank you, though.  Eat your mush, Spanky.  That's terrible.  What else did you get, Roland? 
[00:16:30]  Your egg whites and your food.  Mine, yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you think about you all so far?  It's nice.  You know, wee-wee, poo-poo.  Bonjour.  He's speaking French.  Yeah, what's up?  We were talking about your accommodations.  Ah, ca-cah.  Well, start with the plane.  We kind of told the story, but from your perspective.  When I checked in, they said, please wait over there.  Ten people in front of me.  They all had C-members, but me and five other people. 
[00:17:00]  And yeah, you didn't seat on the plane.  No.  No, screw Joe.  Yeah, no.  He's trying to fit in by speaking some language.  He's speaking the language.  Nice.  And then I saw a picture of you.  You caught a flight with Tom Papa.  Tom Papa, yeah.  He was there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's super nice.  Yeah.  We had an amazing flight.  What a-  Just a bevy of comics.  Colin Quinn, Amy Schumer, and Jim Norton sitting next to me, who, before they even closed the 
[00:17:30]  door on the fucking plane, farted so horrifically.  He stunk up the entire cabin of the plane.  It's unbelievable how bad his farts are.  It was so bad.  He's sick.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, there has to be something going on.  It's like it's demonic possession smell.  Dude, I've never been prouder.  It was such a-  It was, because Colin and Amy are in front of us, and me and Anna are sitting here and  opens to my left.  I dropped one, and I'm like, oh, it's a fucking home run.  It's a doozy. 
[00:18:00]  It was so bad.  I ended up freezing the entire flight, because I had to turn on the air vents at full blast  and make an air curtain between me and Jimmy to hopefully combat the smell.  It was-  It was brutal.  That was child's play, that air curtain.  I got around that in a second.  Oh, yeah.  You really did.  I actually think it went up and tapped Amy and Colin on the shoulder, and when they  turned around, it fucking popped up.  It really did.  Amy was gagging.  She was, like, really ready to throw up.  Yeah, it was great.  And then he did another one.  But another- 
[00:18:30]  He did many.  Yeah, many, many.  He really enjoys it, which is really strange.  Then we got to the hotel.  We're on the escalator, and he's in front of us.  And the sound it made, Opie was just like-  He thought it was the wheel on my luggage.  Because it just kind of went like-  I really did think it was your fucking wheel.  It turned out to be Jimmy.  And then Jimmy was very strategic with this one, because as the escalator's going, you're  now being launched into the cloud.  The cloud of death. 
[00:19:00]  What about the fat broad behind us?  Who saw that?  I think it was Chris or somebody.  She was really fucking pissed off about that.  Oh, did she get some?  Yeah, she was pissed.  Of course she did.  She was so annoyed, but she couldn't figure out where it was coming from.  Maybe it'll wreck her appetite, finally.  Yeah, it was so great dropping it at a certain height and knowing they had to come up through  it.  They were coming up in it.  Through the clouds.  It was terrible.  It was fucking wonderful.  So, Roland, you missed your flight.  You got on the other one.  That was fine, right?  Yeah, that was karma from laughing at Gary. 
[00:19:30]  I think so.  We told Gary how much you laughed at him.  It was a lot.  It was a lot.  And Travis, who drove from New York Beach to Montreal.  Yeah, I got here at 7.30.  7.30?  Oh, wow.  Fuck.  Two and a half hours before Rome.  But thank God your room was set for you when you got here after a long day of traveling.  They had my room.  Now, how did they not have your room?  I don't know.  The guy goes, we oversold.  So, he gave me a room with a couch and he plaited the bed.  I don't understand the oversold concept. 
[00:20:00]  Shouldn't that just be a free room?  Are you paying for that?  They are.  Serious.  Well, I know.  They should give you a real bed.  That's terrible.  That's an uncomfortable.  I mean, it doesn't have to be a giant room, but that's a terrible situation to be on  a fucking pull-out sofa bed in a hotel.  I know.  That's why you didn't sleep.  Oh, you didn't sleep?  No.  No.  I would not have handled that well.  No.  At all.  I admire the way you handle it.  I thought about you.  That's why you're just staying here.  Jimmy's usually so rational when things go wrong. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Really surprised that that would...  Merle, where are we eating tonight?  Did you figure it out?  Oh, last night was a bust.  You didn't have it figured out for the guys and they were really...  They were bummed out that you weren't a good leader.  Very disappointed because you are the guy that talks about all the research that you  do for these restaurants and then when it doesn't pan out and you end up in just  some shithole.  Yeah, because Troy wants to explore.  So when you explore, you miss all the restaurants.  So we go in different places.  No, you couldn't even figure out the...  You couldn't read the map. 
[00:21:00]  Well, it's in French.  It's in French.  Well, the one thing about Roland, he can't see but he refuses to wear glasses.  Yeah.  I ask people on the street, I go, bonjour, where's this place at?  And they go, over there.  Do you start everything with bonjour?  Yeah, I go, bonjour.  Because they're going to speak to you in French.  And then they go, oh, where do I go?  Oh, no.  I go, where do I go?  They go, over there.  So just speak English to them.  Don't say bonjour because then they think you know...  Yeah, you go, bonjour, and they start going, and you're like, ah.  How do you stop them?  How do you stop them? 
[00:21:30]  It's like, bonjour, and they're like, ah, oui.  It is odd that you just, I, of course, ended up at the bar, at the hotel.  And the bartender comes up and he's like, bonjour.  And I don't know any French, but you start going like,  I love it, Captain & Co.  Like, you just start with the fucking accent for no apparent reason.  And I felt like an idiot, which I was.  Hopefully tonight we go to Joe Beef.  Joe Beef?  Yeah.  Anyone know Joe Beef in the audience? 
[00:22:00]  Is that a good joint?  Yeah.  Oh, who's in the back there?  What kind of place is it?  It's French cuisine.  He's a fucking pip.  French cuisine.  Yeah.  Maybe that guy could help us out in the back.  What's that?  He'll tell us.  Troy's got the fucking studio mic, I guess.  Who knows?  I know.  Troy Kwan.  Well, yeah, it's a good, like, Quebecois, traditional, you know, like, classic cuisine. 
[00:22:30]  What is Quebecois?  It's Quebec.  That's like Quebec French.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's like saying it's American.  So it's got good French.  Good stuff?  Quebec cuisine.  Yeah, good stuff.  Steak au poivre?  Like, um.  I want steak au poivre!  Well, I mean, I haven't been to Joe Beef, because it's really tough to get in, but I've been  to Liverpool House, which is only by the same guys.  So we're not getting in there.  It's like getting into Dorcia.  I have a reservation for three.  You do have a reservation. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, that's you.  Yeah, that's good.  No, he means the time.  That's his dinner reservation.  3 a.m.  All right.  The Cuban set it up.  Oh, the Cuban.  Oh, the Cuban.  So for three o'clock, it's for three people?  Yeah.  Why only three people?  Well, because nobody wanted to go when I asked that to work.  No one asked me.  No one said, hey, Jim, do you want to go for Quebec?  I don't remember anyone asking.  Yeah, I would go.  Was it in between a pitch for a horrid guest?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  We'll get back to Roland and more incredible stories from E-Rock.  But first, I think our first comic is here.  Our first friend.  I mean, this is ridiculous.  Yes, it is true.  We've done this in New York.  It is true.  Ladies and gentlemen, Joe DeRosa.  Joe DeRosa is making his way up.  What do you sit on the couch?  It's like fucking the old Johnny Carson show here. 
[00:24:00]  Joe DeRosa.  You've got to awkwardly sit on the couch.  That isn't weird.  This doesn't feel strange at all.  I know.  It's like the Tonight Show.  You want a table in front of you at least?  To me?  Hi, Joe.  Hi, Joe.  How are you guys doing?  There should be a little table in front of the guests so they can put their coffee down.  Oh, I almost forgot about the horrible tattoo.  Oh, I almost forgot.  I almost forgot.  You know who didn't forget about it?  Oh.  Everybody at this fucking festival has been asking me about it, too. 
[00:24:30]  Long sleeves.  That's all you need.  I didn't bring any because I thought it was summer up here, too.  No, apparently not.  Jesus Christ.  I'm going to fucking freeze it up here.  It was 49 degrees last night, right?  Look at that.  Asking you.  Thank you, man.  See, there you can put your coffee down, Joe.  Wobbly table.  Yeah, dude, you get your table, you put your coffee, you put your eye.  So you're getting...  We got the table, dude.  So you're getting some abuse about the tattoo?  Four people yesterday were like, let me see it. 
[00:25:00]  It shows us home.  They were like, let me see it.  It's actually not that bad.  Show the audience.  Show the audience.  Yeah, it's a nice comb.  It's not that bad.  A comb.  It's a nice UPC code.  It's great.  It's a barbershop hole.  All right.  That's good.  You could scan Joe and find out what he's worth.  Yeah, nothing.  Zilch.  Exactly.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  I...  Yeah.  So it was supposed to be this cold?  Is it this cold usually this time of year?  I don't know, man.  We left like 80 degrees, didn't we? 
[00:25:30]  It was...  Yeah, we left like sweltering New York and came up here.  It's not like it's freezing out, but...  Dude, it was 49 degrees last night.  Was it?  Which I know isn't freezing, literally, but I mean, it was fucking cold.  Was it in Celsius?  No, it's like 10 or 15.  I was watching the weather, and I was like, ah, ah, oh, oh, holy shit.  I didn't bring my parka.  Yeah, that whole Celsius thing is by me. 
[00:26:00]  I don't know what the hell it is.  I don't...  I mean, am I the only one that thinks Celsius is wrong?  Yeah.  It's wrong.  It's not the right number for the temperature.  It's like everything else.  It doesn't make sense.  Well, zero is freezing.  A hundred is boiling.  Figure out the middle.  Yeah, it's...  I mean, put your hand in 130 degree water.  Yeah.  Fahrenheit, 130 degree.  Yeah.  Tell me if that feels like 130 to you, or whatever the wrong Celsius number is. 
[00:26:30]  See, you can't even do the conversion.  I don't even know what the conversion is.  How do you even do it?  Oh, God, I don't even know.  Because there's no logical progression to it.  If it's like, it's 22 degrees Celsius, that's 79.1 Fahrenheit.  How the fuck do you come to that number?  We sound like the idiots of the Americans that only think that our way is right when the  rest of the world is pretty much using Celsius.  I don't like kilometers, either.  That kilometer thing.  That's easier.  Driving from the airport to the hotel in the van gave me an anxiety attack. 
[00:27:00]  I'm like looking out the window thinking, if I was driving on these roads, I wouldn't  know where the fuck I was.  Because the signs is rue everything, and then every other sign is in French, and there's  not like some hieroglyphic telling me what I'm supposed to do.  I was like, I wouldn't know where I'm going.  You know how disappointed I was when I saw a sign that said rue, and I realized that meant  road?  I was thinking RuPaul Trani. 
[00:27:30]  I knew that was going to bomb, and I'd have to explain it to you.  Well, it did, and you did.  Joe, what do you think of Montreal?  You've been up here before, right?  Yeah.  You doing anything fun last night?  I like it up here, man.  It's a nice city you guys have.  Yeah.  A little bit of an attitude sometimes.  Attitude?  A little bit.  A little, I think, anti-American.  There's a little bit of that, like, uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[00:28:00]  You know.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Bonjour, you fucking pig.  Yeah.  You think there's a little of that?  Well, it's, it's, it's, uh, I mean, it's, it's, yeah, there's definitely a little, I mean,  I'm not knocking much.  I like it up here a lot.  But there's definitely a little, like, oh, you Americans, you know, we're sophisticated 
[00:28:30]  here.  And it's like, are, are you, I'm sorry, I couldn't see the sophistication through the  wall of toothless hookers combing every fucking street I've walked out.  It's like a dildo shop every 10 feet.  Yet somehow I'm a fucking boorish American.  Because I don't like Celsius.  Yes, yes.  You don't like the Celsius scale.  It's weird to see all that.  Because in New York, they clean that shit up.  You don't see the toothless hookers.  No, no, right?  Fuck.  It's strange.  But it seems like a nice, even though they have that, though, it seems like a nice city. 
[00:29:00]  So many more homeless people just laying around up here.  Are there more homeless people?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  They don't roust them like they do in New York?  We like to roust our homeless.  You know, give them a little kick.  Come on, keep it moving.  Give them the old, uh, what do they call it?  A wood shampoo.  Yeah.  That one.  What's the wood shampoo?  That's where a cop would take his billy club and beat someone over the head with it.  Yeah.  A wood shampoo.  Yeah, I had to give him a wood shampoo.  You know what I mean? 
[00:29:30]  I never heard that.  Brilliant.  Only an old school cop would know that one.  Or you.  Or me.  Everyone we hang out with apparently is an old school cop.  What the fuck the deal is?  I like it, though.  But if you think about America and stuff, it's the same thing.  Like, we look at foreigners and we're like, oh, yeah, you're number one, motherfucker.  USA.  So, you know, you come to another country and they're very proud of their, uh, their nation.  Yes.  Cities.  Yes.  It is a very truly European-feeling city. 
[00:30:00]  That, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because there is a high culture index here and it is very sophisticated, yet there's a really strange pussy thirst everywhere you go.  Is that what's going on?  Yeah.  You know, it's just, yeah.  What's the crime rate like up here?  A lot of crime in Montreal.  Oh, let's go to the crowd again.  Yeah.  Do we get a lot of crime?  Anyone?  No, apparently, like, you'd know, people would be like, yeah, holy shit, he's fucking crazy. 
[00:30:30]  But, uh, apparently not.  No.  See, they got that shit figured out.  Good for them.  Oh, no.  Fuck.  We can't do it in America because, as you know, we love our guns.  Some of us do.  We love our guns.  Well, I love enough guns for everybody.  I was very disappointed, uh, but, you know, I can't be packing, as they call it in the U.S.  Packing heat.  But, uh, yeah, because, you know, I'm paranoid.  I'm very fucking paranoid, so I like carrying a gun around with me. 
[00:31:00]  But, apparently, up here, people don't carry guns?  You're not allowed to, like, carry a gun with you?  What are you, people crazy?  This sounds like the speech you would give on the witness stand when you finally decided to speak.  To a stunned, silent courtroom.  What, you people crazy?  Is this just me?  You're nuts.  Why?  Bus passengers cutting heads off.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Well, how do they get their violence out up here?  Yeah, what do you do? 
[00:31:30]  If you're not shooting people like we do.  Hockey.  What is it?  Yeah.  Stab each other?  Anyone?  Stabbings, clubbings, beatings.  What's the big thing?  Kind of violence.  God, we love our violence.  They don't have violence.  What's the cop term for stabbing?  Like metal showers or something like that?  Yeah, something like it.  Yeah.  Wow.  No violence up here.  That's weird.  Very strange.  Huh?  Arson?  Arson?  Arson.  A good one?  Wait, there's pretty much a firebombing every... 
[00:32:00]  That's because the people are fucking freezing.  Jesus Christ.  Just trying to keep warm, sir.  It's pretty much restaurants and bars that are getting firebombed weekly.  By who?  Roll that.  He can't get reservations.  Nobody knows.  Wait, no one knows who's doing this?  We call that Jewish lightning in the States.  We do.  Yeah, they're like, oh, little Jewish lightning struck your restaurant, huh?  Ha, ha, wink, wink.  And then...  You know, they get the insurance money. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, logic would say it's unpaid bills.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, whenever something happens.  Cops don't know anything.  Nobody knows anything, so...  Hey, anybody that watch Goodfellas knows that.  Exactly.  You light a match.  That's all he got up here.  Yeah.  That's all he got up here.  That's crazy.  A little arson.  That's it, huh?  You feel relatively safe, like, walking the streets at night?  Something like that, yeah.  What are the cops like here?  Cordial?  Hey.  Bonjour.  Yeah.  Yeah, the cops...  I got pulled over in the Adirondacks coming up here. 
[00:33:00]  I drove up.  Oh, you drove?  Yeah.  How was that?  Well, I was doing 94 through the Adirondacks.  Jesus.  Why not?  And I got pulled over.  Yeah.  You know how many cops show up when you do 94 through the Adirondacks?  All of them.  Oh, really?  What's going on?  There's like eight cops.  They had nothing to do.  And then the guy started accusing me of smoking weed.  He's going, your car stinks like smoke.  I'm like, yeah, I smoke.  I smoke.  I smoked a cigarette in here.  He's like, you sure you're not covering something up, son? 
[00:33:30]  Dude, he...  Holy shit.  Yeah.  He goes, can you come out of...  You got a taillight out, boy.  Yeah.  I know.  Fucking Buford T-Junkist.  He pulled me out of the...  Not pulled me out, but he goes, can you get out of the car?  I'm like, yeah.  And dude, he walked me into the grass and he starts interrogating me.  And he's going like...  He's going, now listen, you smoke, right?  And I'm like, yeah.  And he's like, all right, you smoke cigarettes.  You sure you're not smoking them?  Dude, it was such a weird... 
[00:34:00]  This was a big thing for him, I guess.  Dude, it was so...  I swear to God, I swear to you, I was waiting for him to go.  I'm fucking with you.  I'm an Opiate Anthony fan.  It made no fucking sense.  Yeah.  He went back to the car.  I had other comics in the car.  We went back to the car and made me stand outside.  He was putting his head in the car.  You know how you tell if the cop's serious, though?  How?  You fucking grab his gun.  Yeah.  Because that will tell right away if it's a real cop or if it's just a joke.  Some asshole.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:34:30]  So they were really giving you the business.  Yeah.  And I was like, officer, please.  We're just like four comedians.  We just need to get up to Canada.  Our flight got canceled.  We got to do this TV show.  We got to get up there.  Like, we're not trying to be assholes.  We just need to get there.  And he's like, they'll understand that your flight was canceled.  That wasn't your fault.  And I was like, no, no, no.  They'll understand.  Oh, no.  But I need to fucking get up there.  Right.  And he just kept going, yeah, but they would get it.  And they started arguing the logistics of whether the festival would understand about 
[00:35:00]  whose fault it was, why the flight was canceled.  They had a rondacks.  They don't do anything out there.  They get the occasional bear attack.  They're like, they got to pick up someone's fucking arm.  By that, you mean a fat gay guy?  Yes.  A bearded man.  A bearded, rotund gentleman.  Who else was in the car with you?  A comedian named Carmen Lynch.  No one we know.  Another comedian.  Carmen Lynch is, I think I did a set with her last night.  She's very funny.  Yeah, she's kind of tall and slim, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  She is funny.  Yeah, and another guy named Lee Camp, who's very funny, and another comedian named Sabrina, 
[00:35:30]  whose last name is escaping me.  She's short, long and brown hair.  I think she was on that show, too.  Yeah, she's short, tan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were like the top bill in that car.  That's the way I like it, man.  Joe was having that conversation with the people in the backseat.  You know, the key to success.  You know, once you reach my level.  You know, the second time I did the Carson Daly program. 
[00:36:00]  Now, listen, guys.  Did he get the ticket?  He gave me the ticket, but...  Boom.  Oh, man.  Wow.  That's a biggie.  He had mercy on me.  He gave me a Valium and sent me on my way.  Good fellas.  Anybody?  No?  All right.  Hey, I threw it out there.  He gave me a ticket?  He gave me a ticket.  He goes, I'm not going to give you the ticket for doing 94, because you'll get a $200 search,  like, whatever, fucking bonus charge for doing 94, plus whatever.  He goes, I'm going to bump it down to 84. 
[00:36:30]  And he goes, if you do...  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  Well, then he goes...  But this was the one thing I thought it was...  If you suck my dick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What could you have possibly hit?  There's nothing up there.  There's nothing up there.  I don't know.  Just let you go.  Yeah.  It was like, you know, we're all here on the side of the road right now.  We're safe.  There's seven fucking people that live in this town.  Right.  Work on the police force.  Yeah.  It was, yeah, but the one thing that he...  It's coming in on Twitter that you were definitely smoking pot.  No. 
[00:37:00]  I wasn't.  Wow.  It's coming to Twitter people.  I wasn't.  They know.  They know.  This is...  They know.  This is what I was offended about, was that he was, like, trying to, like, get me to,  like, accidentally admit...  Come on, son.  ...to pot.  Make it easy on yourself.  Right.  Right.  What?  He goes...  He goes in the slumber.  Yeah, like, first 48, you know.  You know, tell us what happened.  We just want to hear your side of the story.  Well, he goes...  At one point, he goes, he goes, son, you're telling...  Are you sure you don't indulge once in a while?  It's like, buddy, I do fucking blow once in a while. 
[00:37:30]  I just don't have it on me right now.  I'm telling you.  I hope you actually said that to him.  No, I didn't.  With your finger in his chest.  Yeah.  Hey, pal.  So, it was just...  It was like...  But the one cool thing he said was, he goes, he goes, listen to me.  If you do 80 for the rest of the way, you should be fine.  Oh.  And I was like, all right, he's kind of telling me.  I'd be like, could you put that in writing so I could give it to the next motherfucker  that pulls me over?  So, that's kind of cool.  He'd let you do 80 in the area, obviously.  Yeah, I was kind of like, all right, that's nice that he told me, like, look, we probably 
[00:38:00]  won't.  Joe, he's a dick.  The guy's...  Yeah.  He had a nice chat with him, and he still gave you a ticket for 84.  True.  He should have knocked it down to, like, 70 or something like that.  He probably radioed his buddy up the road, and he goes, hey, there's going to be some  guy doing 80.  Right.  Coming through.  Feel free to grab him.  Got another one.  And he's probably smoking weed.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got a potter on his way.  Decorating the whole town to the tune of $40.  $40.  That's an attention getter.  That's the man act. 
[00:38:30]  Wow.  Everybody had a little adventure coming up here.  Jesus.  I didn't...  What happened to you guys?  Ah, we took Roland.  Oh, no.  We had it easy.  Yeah, Roland didn't have a flight.  They put him in a fucking storage closet with a pull-away bed or something.  Yeah.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at the signs.  Of course we are.  Where's Roland?  Roland needs us.  Nothing.  We need to put Roland on...  Thanks for covering my goodfellas, Bob, for two minutes to go.  We need to put Roland on the couch.  Yeah.  He's too much fun.  He's already on that upstairs in his room. 
[00:39:00]  We need to put Roland on a bed.  It's too much fun to have him in the back.  Roland is the best.  I'm glad he didn't get on...  He's the greatest.  He wanted to get on a flight, though.  All he was looking forward to was taking his shit on the plane.  Roland had to shit at the studio.  He goes, I know how I'm holding it for the plane.  He wanted to pick a dump.  Why?  Because he's so...  He's a horrible traveler.  We've said it.  He's so strange.  Like to fuck people up like he did?  Oh, yeah.  With this fucking...  You're like Pepe Le Pew.  Yeah.  We're getting... 
[00:39:30]  Someone wants us to ask about FLQ.  I don't know.  What is the...  Oh, no?  Uh-oh.  Wow.  That's a bad one, huh?  What's...  I have no idea.  Someone just goes to ask the crowd about FLQ.  What's FLQ?  And they just all went, ah.  All right.  You got somebody wanting to fess up with some information.  What was it?  There were a terrorist group from the 60s that kidnapped a politician and killed him.  Oh.  And the people, some of the people got exported to Cuba. 
[00:40:00]  They had to leave the country.  Oh, yeah.  It was a whole big political thing.  In the 60s?  It was a long time ago.  In the 60s?  Late 60s.  1969, 1970.  What if somebody wanted us to ask the audience?  Why would somebody...  Yeah, yeah.  It's an old party.  It's not like the PQ, which is a provincial leader right now.  You ever eat at the DQ?  The Dairy Queen, yeah.  There's one near where I live.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Righteous.  Can I say hi to my boss?  He let me come to worker.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he did?  Info at B5.net.  He just said, please, say the company if you need barcode scanners.  Barcode scanners? 
[00:40:30]  Well...  Do you need...  Joe?  Joe, do you want another chat?  Barcode.  He could translate that thing for you, at least.  For all your barcode scanner needs.  I hope we're not flooding that website right now, because we said it.  Yeah, who doesn't need a good barcode scanner?  So, DFLQ was terrorizing Montreal, I guess.  In the 60s.  In the 60s, all right.  Anything else?  Has anybody got any Hindenburg information?  Maybe we could...  The Minutemen?  Want to comment on the Minutemen?  Now, did you guys all groan because it's a bad memory, or did you groan like, oh, who 
[00:41:00]  cares?  It happened in the 60s?  Yeah, so who cares?  Oh, I thought...  I was like, wow, what a respectful city.  They were like, you don't talk about that.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Yeah, we don't talk about that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Roland's on the couch.  I forgot what we wanted to ask him.  I don't know.  Or did you have something?  Oh, what happened...  Yeah, go ahead, Joe.  Yeah, what happened on the way up...  What happened?  Just dicks in the ass.  Dicks in the ass?  Sounds good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They got bumps on the fly. 
[00:41:30]  Where are you sleeping?  Opie said you got a cot in her closet or something?  No, it's like a couch, and then you pull it out of the bed.  Where, though?  Pull out bed.  Here.  No, no, no, but in a room, right?  In a room, yeah.  Why don't they just give you the room?  It's a room, but it's...  It's a room, yeah.  See, I don't understand.  If it's a room, why don't they just give you the room?  There's someone in the suite, and you are in a room off the suite?  I don't know.  I think it's a room.  It has a bathroom and everything.  It's a living room.  It doesn't have a TV. 
[00:42:00]  But who's in the bedroom part of the room?  You hear that?  His TV didn't work either.  Yeah, they fixed it.  Oh, good.  They went, here you go.  What's wrong?  Great, so you can watch Family Guy in French.  Yeah.  Which is the oddest thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  It's on Scary Channel.  Bear Grylls goes, bonjour.  Say that now.  Bonjour.  I don't know.  I saw a flight crew come in late last night, and I bet you that they didn't fucking get  stuck for their robes.  They had beds. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, I didn't know that.  It was a flight crew came in, so they had to have beds.  They saw you coming at a reservation.  They did.  They knew they had one less room, and they're like, we're fucking this guy over.  And they did.  They did.  Why was Travis laughing?  Are you looking at the picture of his room?  No, because last night, it's like 10 o'clock, and I get a text from Roland.  I haven't heard from Roland all day.  And the text is just, how's your room?  And so I tell him, you know, it's okay.  It's next to the festival, so it's a little loud.  And he just replies with, I have a sofa bed.  And I thought he was bragging. 
[00:43:00]  Like, I have a bed and a sofa.  Oh, no.  Let me text Travis so I can brag.  No.  Sofa bed.  But now I find out that he's got half a room that someone's probably going to walk  into from their suite to the sunlight.  Oh, man.  Poor bastards.  See me taking a shit with the door open?  What?  What is this?  I don't understand what room doesn't have a bed in it.  I'm confused.  No, it's a Canadian thing, I guess.  I don't know.  No.  Roland's like, there's no room for the bed. 
[00:43:30]  There's all this sidewalk everywhere.  And it was really loud?  Yeah.  Who was saying that, E-Rock, I guess, that your room was vibrating from all the noise  on St. Catherine?  Yeah.  And the festival?  I heard Bruno Mars over and over again.  Over and over.  Fuck.  Jesus Christ.  I still can't get, I don't understand.  There's either a room or not a room.  Yeah, I don't know.  There's a room with a bed in it, and then there's a sofa with that.  Let's just talk about that for three hours.  Is somebody else? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  I know.  I'm so fucking.  Like, are you sharing this room with somebody?  No.  I hope not.  I hope not.  You know what I think?  You know what I think it is?  Huh?  I think it's kind of like what Jim said.  Like, it's probably, you know, it can be a suite, like a living room of a suite up here,  but they just, there's a door that they can lock it off, and they probably gave it to Roland.  You have a shower in there, though, right?  It's probably like a small room that they give to, like, staff who have to stay here if  there's, like, a weather emergency and they can't go home. 
[00:44:30]  So, like, if the cleaning crew has to stay, they're like, yeah, there's a sofa bed in there.  This was the Overlook Hotel.  Yeah.  That's where Jack Torrance and his wife would have stayed.  Oh, there you go.  It's like, you know, the help.  The help.  The hair taker.  Well, okay.  Well, speed to you.  Should we get back to the E-Rock stories?  Yeah.  They were terrific.  Yeah, E-Rock.  Oh, my God, yeah.  They were really good.  E-Rock.  Got the sound buzzing.  What do you know about E-Rock and his trip so far?  E-Rock, we came in with him. 
[00:45:00]  We were all hanging out.  And everybody was like, all right, we're going to go up to the room and, like, take naps and  then we'll hang out later.  Right.  And so we all start texting each other like an hour and a half later.  E-Rock didn't text one person.  No.  He just went down to the lobby and walked around by himself.  You do hear the radio show every morning, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  He is a loner.  I think there's a reason for that.  Yeah.  He doesn't like the company of other people.  Anyone.  Yeah.  Of the show, yes. 
[00:45:30]  Were you scoping hookers?  Yeah.  That's exactly what I was doing.  Jim said I was trolling for Big Clit this morning.  Wonderful.  Big Clit.  Yeah.  Any plans for tonight?  Besides dinner with Roland?  Yeah.  Big reservation for three.  For three.  We'll squeeze in.  We'll call you an Eric.  Yeah.  What's going on tonight?  Any fun?  Hijinks? 
[00:46:00]  Shenanigans?  I don't know.  Are you going to the casino tonight?  I might.  I might go to the casino tonight.  Friday show canceled.  I don't know.  It sounds like a good casino from what I heard.  It's nice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's a nice movie.  You've been there?  You've been.  I don't roll like you, but yeah.  Who does, right?  No.  I don't fucking know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You are an anomaly if I've ever met one, my friend.  Yeah.  It's a nice casino, though.  It's a nice place.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You take American? 
[00:46:30]  Do they take American?  American money?  I believe so.  American money?  I think, yeah.  You know, years ago, people, our dollar was more money than yours.  Thank you.  Just trying to bring that up.  It was an ancient conquest.  We're up again.  We're four cents, I think, above their dollar right now.  No.  I think we're four cents under.  Yeah.  It's like 90-something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were at a restaurant last night, and Troy was yelling at the waitress, saying that,  you know, this country hates our shitty money.  Whoa.  It was really uncomfortable for everybody. 
[00:47:00]  Why are you?  She was a nice lady, just giving us salads, and you're yelling at her.  Americans have to be like that.  Yeah, like, we come up here, and then we bitch that they're speaking French, and it's like,  oh, yeah, poor them.  They speak two fucking languages fluently, and we're just there like, you dummy.  Troy couldn't wrap his head around the fact that this particular joint, the dollar was  worth 90 cents, right?  Yeah.  I don't even think she knew what I was talking about, anyway.  She seemed kind of confused.  She was trying to be nice, and you were yelling at her.  She was confused because she figured Troy couldn't be saying what it sounded like he was saying. 
[00:47:30]  Which is, you hate our shitty money.  He said, so what you're basically, he looked at this, like, young waitress and looked at  it and said, so what you're telling us is you piss and shit on our money.  That's what you're telling us.  That's what he said.  She's going, no, I don't understand.  No, I don't, what?  No, I don't.  Oh, man.  Just having some fun with the locals, you know?  Yeah, you were joking, right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's a comedy festival, right?  Yeah, they just go around insulting people. 
[00:48:00]  It was actually entertaining.  Yeah.  I got another question coming in on Twitter.  What is the naked breakfast?  Anyone?  Anyone want to cop to that?  Totally nude.  Totally nude breakfast.  No?  No one knows what that is.  The naked breakfast.  These Twitter people are morons when it comes to a...  Well, supposedly it's awful strippers serving breakfast at a diner.  Which diner, though?  That means that.  It would be fun, but who wants that?  Well, you just don't eat the food.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  I don't even like those...  No one?  ...buffet...  I like the foot-long fucking...  Or three-foot heroes at the strip clubs.  Hey, look.  If a midget saves lives, then he deserves to be treated properly.  Want some gloop?  No, I don't want any...  Oh, that looks...  Ah!  God damn.  That looks horrible.  Magic trick.  Oh, man.  Your oatmeal is supposed to fall.  Oh!  There it goes.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The ball had a miscarriage.  We finally got a job for Zito. 
[00:49:00]  Where's Zito?  Oatmeal just spilled...  I knew that was going to happen.  It spilled all over the...  Oh, you dropped your goo!  Hey, that's what your face looked like after last night.  I pressed my luck on that one.  Goosh!  Can you please do French dice?  Hey, bonjour, you fucking asshole!  Oh, great.  Oh, it smells like oatmeal. 
[00:49:30]  It looks better than Jimmy's farts.  It looks like vomit.  And thank you for doing that.  You saved me from my awful midget bomb.  Oh, that was a bomb, Jimmy.  Wait, can we play that back?  That was a bomb.  I didn't hear it.  What did you say?  Suffice to say, it was a bomb.  Oh, it was a bomb.  Yeah, you didn't have it, Travis.  It was not good.  I can ask Sal.  Oh, Sal.  Back again, Jimmy.  Fucking...  Yeah, I actually don't have it in Google Chrome.  We've got to go back to New York.  Sal will cut it if he's paying attention.  Can Sal talk to us from New York? 
[00:50:00]  On the show?  Yeah.  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Hi, Sal.  I've never seen Opi Livemore.  Disappointed.  Yeah, it's just...  How's New York?  You didn't bring gorgeous little Sal?  No.  Oh, you could have sold him for poutine up here.  We should have brought the interns, though.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Two lovely...  They would have been very...  Imagine them just sitting on the couch, like, ah, he giggling like they do.  I imagined it up in my room ten minutes ago.  If there's any question of people's value here, Zito just informed all of us he will 
[00:50:30]  not be cleaning up Opi's Oatmeal.  Wow.  Good for you.  Damn.  He's just here to hang the posters.  Yeah.  That's his whole job.  He's done already.  Sal, what's going on in New York?  Is it lonely?  Yeah, I'd much rather be there.  Yeah, I'd much rather be there.  For sure.  Oh, well.  We'd much rather you be where you are.  What's that, Sal?  I'm pulling the clip for you guys right now.  Thank you.  No problem.  No problem.  Yeah.  Why don't you pull the trigger? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Pull the clip out of a grenade.  Slip or a pin.  Yeah, no, but it's just...  He's got the studio to himself in New York.  You know, right now as he's talking, he's tucking his cock between his legs in front of  a mirror somewhere.  Playing with his nipples.  Oh, fuck me.  All right, I got it.  But he's probably making all the moves on the interns now because he's alone there.  He's the big guy.  He's the guy in charge now over there, right?  Yeah, he is. 
[00:51:30]  He's the last.  It's like when everyone on the Enterprise had a beam down and they left like fucking Chekhov.  Chekhov, you have the con.  Yeah.  It's like, what's Chekhov going to do?  Yeah.  Kirk, Chekhov's a good man, but he's no captain.  Yeah.  He's beamed everybody worthwhile off the fucking ship.  That's Sal.  And now he's got the two interns to be like, hey.  We actually have three interns this semester.  I don't know if you realize.  We have three.  Oh.  Three interns.  Another girl?  It's a boy.  There's a boy in the mix. 
[00:52:00]  We pay no attention to him.  I don't understand when you're allowed to have interns why a boy even comes into the picture.  Oh, I would just have an armada of fucking 19-year-old girls.  For many years, we were very distracted by the women.  So we decided maybe we should keep them away.  All right.  That's fair.  Now we're going back to that.  Dude.  We're going back to that.  Isn't it nice?  It is nice.  They bring like this fucking festive atmosphere to the studio.  They walk in. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, naked breakfast.  Eating an old stripper with flapjack tits.  Okay.  All right.  Now we know.  Sal's got that clipped if you want.  Oh, thank God.  I'm going to clean up my oatmeal.  Now you've got to clean up your own because fucking Zito told you to go fuck yourself.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus.  What is this?  It's oatmeal.  It looks fucking disgusting.  It has skin on it.  Yeah.  Looks like you're cleaning up fucking our Bud Dwyer's office. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, man.  Oatmeal gets like that when you let it sit.  For like, I don't know, 20 minutes or whatever.  It gets gooey.  It's not for two minutes.  Coagulated.  It coagulates.  Yes.  That'd be the.  This is some fucked up repugnant shit.  All right.  We have the clip or what?  Sal?  I don't even like those.  No one?  I don't like those buffets.  I like the foot long fucking or three foot heroes at the strip clubs.  Hey, look.  If a midget saves lives, then he deserves to be treated properly. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, okay.  Three foot hero.  I got it.  Oh.  A midget saves lives.  Yeah, we're back live now.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was.  Pilot to bombardier.  Pilot to bombardier.  We are over target.  Yeah.  That was not a good one.  I don't think you got to tell him.  No, I know.  It's funny.  I was afraid that I would get no sounds after it.  I just kept talking.  That was fucking terrible. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Who else is showing up today?  We got the lovely and talented Joe DeRosa.  Well, sure, Joe.  What about Bob Kelly?  I hear Bob Kelly is doing a podcast from the lobby.  He's doing a live podcast today.  I'm doing it.  From the lobby?  I heard he's setting up in the lobby of the hotel.  And if he calls it Bobby from the lobby, I'll shoot him.  I'll fucking shoot him. 
[00:54:30]  There's no way he won't call it that.  I don't think.  I know.  Dude, welcome to Bobby from the lobby.  Oh.  He's going to slobby from the lobby.  Oh, jeez, dear.  Look, I love the guy.  He's got to do something.  Why don't you wait until he's here to defend himself?  No, then he makes fun of me.  I know.  He's brutal.  I know how this shit works.  It's terrible.  He's rough.  Bobby doesn't play.  No.  He takes shots at him.  Oh, fuck.  He's rough.  Really, dude?  That's how you know Bob is genuinely mad. 
[00:55:00]  Really, dude?  Really, dude?  I did, dude.  We were in the bar last night.  Yeah.  And I just go, I pull up my cigarettes and go, Bob, you want a cigarette, dude?  And he goes, I fucking quit two years ago.  You fucking cocksucker.  And he got fucking angry at me.  Because he wanted a cigarette.  That's the only reason he got that pissed.  Yeah.  And I kept doing it.  And he just kept going, fuck you, you piece of shit.  But Jim's right.  Like, you could tell, like, when he goes into, like, that fuck you, like, you're like, oh,  I think I made me a little bit bad. 
[00:55:30]  You rattled the ball.  Hey, I felt bad.  I was like, I was just fucking around.  It's an asshole thing to do to wave a thing in a guy that, you know, that quits.  Well, well, yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  He did enjoy his cigarettes.  Hey, you guys, I don't know if you want to.  Take a break?  Yeah, we do.  Denny wanted to say hi back in New York.  Is Denny?  He's very needy.  Oh, boy.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Denny.  Hi, Denny. 
[00:56:00]  How's everything doing?  Cross the border.  People think this is a bit, by the way.  No, no.  This is him.  It's him.  Well, we've got to ask him, do you have any advice for our live broadcast?  Just go out there and meet the people.  Shake hands.  Take pictures.  You know, leave your mark.  Especially when you go on a break.  Don't walk away from the crowd.  Keep smiling.  Talk to them.  Engage the audience.  Engage the audience.  Okay.  Should we try to go local?  Well, definitely, yeah.  I mean, you're doing a great job of it now. 
[00:56:30]  You're talking about, you know, all the fun you guys had last night, where Anthony might  be going tonight, and some of the restaurants.  Taking in the culture.  So that's a good thing.  What about the naked breakfast?  I know you don't work blue, but would you have breakfast served by a naked broad?  Sure.  Why not?  Sure.  Why not?  Ah, see?  All right.  He doesn't work blue.  When in Canada.  But he is a man.  When in Canada.  When in Canada.  There it is.  So we should do that.  Yeah, yeah.  And you guys have prizes to give away?  You got some koozies or some t-shirts or something? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, to the crowd, we should have had some swag for them?  Yeah, frisbees are good, too.  Frisbees are good.  Frisbees?  Because it's the summertime.  Not here.  It's freezing up here, Danny.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  But I hear it's kind of cold in New York, too.  Yeah.  Should we do a local weather break?  Definitely.  Why?  And try to do it with three areas up there.  Currently, it's 49 in Montreal.  It's, you know, 42 in Vancouver, and we're freezing our butts off here in the studio. 
[00:57:30]  And then you go right into the break.  I love this guy.  He's my favorite.  This guy should be teaching radio.  Be in a classroom somewhere, teaching people stuff they'll never use in the real world radio.  And do the weather about three areas.  Three areas.  This is everything a program director told him over the whole course of his career.  Like, he remembered everything.  We were told this shit, too, but we just didn't listen. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Danny, should we play some bumpers in and out of the breaks?  Definitely.  I would play the Canadian artists.  Yeah, definitely.  Like who?  Guess who?  BTO.  Anne Murray.  Brian Adams.  Anne Murray.  Born in Whitefoot.  Anne Murray.  How about Rush?  Rush.  He doesn't even say Rush.  Neil Young.  How about Neil Young?  He's good, too.  He's got a couple of hits.  A couple.  Fucking Denny.  Yeah.  Were they all Canadian artists that he just wrote?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How did he know?  Those are the basic ones. 
[00:58:30]  Don't question it.  Don't question it.  He just knows everything.  Right.  About music, radio.  He's the master.  You got a question for him about radio?  Joe, before we take a break?  Yeah.  Denny?  Yes, sir.  I have a question.  Yes.  How do I bang the new interns at the Opie and Anthony show?  Take them out to breakfast.  Get to know them.  Take them out to one of your shows.  And then get a new face and body. 
[00:59:00]  And don't show them your tattoo.  Oh.  He's taking shots at the tattoo.  There was a tattoo joke in there.  What did he say?  Yeah.  He's even taking shots at the tattoo.  Here, what did he say?  I just heard tattoo.  Get rid of it or something.  This fucking couch, man.  You like it, right?  It's just the most awkward way to look at the three of you guys.  You relax, though.  You relax.  Yeah, just chill out.  You're fidgeting.  Can I hold the mic?  No.  Oh, boy.  Now you're...  We're actually going to take a break, and then I think you move down the couch. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, I'm getting the McMahon?  You're McMahon-ing me?  You get the second slide down.  Somebody else is coming.  You get to move down the couch.  Oh, there's a handheld for you.  A handheld right there.  And then we get Joe DeRosa, Bob Kelly will join the program after the break.  Now you're holding a mic, yet talking into the mic that you just still had.  Yeah, what do you...  There you go.  There we go.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah, I know.  Like an old art rock band when they would tape the two mics together.  It's like you're doing a press conference.  And also, Bob Bobby's here, and Tom Poppins coming by, Jesse Joyce, Chris DiStefano, Judah, 
[01:00:00]  Freelander.  John Mulaney, and Kurt Mesker.  Wow, nice.  Very packed lineup.  And maybe other people.  Who knows?  I hope so.  Maybe somebody with a vagina.  That would be nice in fucking two days.  Let's hear it for Joe DeRosa, everyone.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to take a break.  We'll be back live from Montreal at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival.  The O.P.  This is the O.P. 
[01:00:30]  The O.P.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we're live in Montreal, Canada.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got Joe DeRosa on the couch.  He moved down the couch.  He moved down the couch.  Yes.  Even though another new guest isn't sitting there yet.  Right.  Now you're even further away from us, Joe DeRosa.  Yeah.  But he's got a mic again.  Yeah.  Now I can hear you.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  Sorry. 
[01:01:00]  He said you.  The guy just came over.  He goes, you might need these headphones.  Oh, you didn't have headphones on.  I was like, I won't need them.  And then you guys started talking.  I couldn't hear a fucking thing.  It's very handy.  Yes.  In the radio biz.  These guys set up a really nice spot for us, by the way.  Holy.  Yeah.  What the hell?  The broadcast sounds great.  Thank you, guys.  It does sound very good.  For real, man.  Thank you, sir.  We're used to incompetence back home.  So it's kind of nice to have things set up.  And that's just us.  Hey, folks.  A little self-deprecation, it's called.  It endears you to the crowd. 
[01:01:30]  That's right.  Denny told me that.  Yeah.  Did you work the crowd during the break?  I sat here with my arms folded while three people took my picture.  Oh, all right.  Did they get yelled at?  Ah, Jesus.  What's the matter?  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened, Jim?  Did someone get yelled at for filming?  Are we not allowed to film in here?  Troy, what's going on?  You're dead?  You're working the crowd.  What's happened?  Let's talk to him.  I don't know.  Someone told me I wasn't allowed to film here.  Why?  What happened?  What? 
[01:02:00]  Recording.  Video recording.  Why?  I don't know.  What?  What's going on in this fucking shitty banquet room?  That's a secret.  Someone was just drinking their coffee very nervously.  Uh-oh.  So I think it might have been the radio wizard.  Is it?  Yeah.  What could possibly be?  I'm observing the room.  He just got very nervous.  Sir, what could be the reason for not letting somebody take a little video of us?  A little video is fine.  He'd been recording the whole show from start. 
[01:02:30]  Or at least it appeared that way.  Oh, wow.  Short video is totally fine.  Okay.  Well, I guess you should all be inspired by that if anybody wants a short video.  Vine videos are okay.  Vine videos are okay.  He has Instagram no good.  Vine videos are okay.  Just six seconds.  Who cares if there's a shitty...  Oh, you were recording the entire program.  Well, I started at the beginning, yeah.  Oh, what were you going to do with it?  YouTube surveillance. 
[01:03:00]  I say...  He was sent by Big A.  Big A.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Just sneak around.  Oh, just film.  Who cares?  I could personally give one large shit.  Apparently, the company frowns on it.  I don't know.  No, just film whatever you want.  Yeah.  Film this fucking magic.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Make sure you get the signage.  Chuck Zito didn't put up. 
[01:03:30]  No, Chuck Zito, why would he?  He was an ex-Hell's Angel.  Oh.  Mark Zito.  Oh, his name's not Chuck Zito.  Mark Zito, yeah.  I would rather hang out with Chuck Zito.  So would I.  And Mark Zito.  Oh, we all would.  Yeah, yeah.  God, yeah.  He's all right.  Yeah.  Why don't we get our next comic on the show?  Jesse Joyce is around here.  Oh, Jesse Joyce.  Bring him on.  Here he comes.  Very, very funny.  What's up, Jesse?  Thank you, sir.  Join the lovely and talented Joe DeRosa on the couch.  This is awkward, I know.  How are you?  This is a little too formal for us. 
[01:04:00]  It is formal.  This is very formal, but we're giving it a shot.  Jesse, take that.  This was like where your posture was?  Yeah.  It really is an uncomfortable looking position.  They're hunched over on the couch to the mic.  Right.  Yeah, this is weird.  All right, sweet.  We did it.  Now you need a pillow tucked behind your back.  That's what, I don't know, Joe just suggested it.  That's great.  It's like propping up the elephant man for sleep.  Jesse was telling me, you know, backstage, wherever the hell you want to call it, that  you have a felony and you couldn't come to Canada for a long time. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, well, that's the way, I have a DUI.  That's what got me sober like eight years ago, but it's considered a felony here.  Right.  So I love hearing those stories.  Like, it happens every year where guys end up, like, not being able to get in for this.  Sure.  They get turned away at the border.  But, so, like, it was $1,800 worth of paperwork I'd have to get every year to be able to come  here.  Jesus.  I had to get, like, a lawyer in Toronto and everything.  Right.  But the thing is that when you get the paperwork, it's because it's a felony here, you get, like,  felony exemption paperwork.  That's what it is.  So they, like, staple in your passport. 
[01:05:00]  So it just says you're a felon, but it doesn't say why you're a felon.  Whoa, really?  So I would show up to the border every time with fucking serial rapist paperwork, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I have to, like, hand it to him, you know?  And it's, like, this guy either runs a child pornography ring or he's allergic to whiskey  is one of the two.  Yeah, which is it?  Oh, well, it's all.  Well, Joe DeRosa was smoking pot on the way up here, and he was going 94 miles an hour.  You almost had a felony, Joe.  94.  Could you imagine the crime if this comedian sitting here was turned away from this festival? 
[01:05:30]  That would have been.  The people would have been deprived from seeing this set of tits.  Inexcusable.  At 7 o'clock in the morning.  And the sneakers from the Skipper from Gilligan Island.  Oh, Gilligan Island.  I know.  They're like slippers.  They're fun.  They're terrible shoes, Joe.  The first time I saw you with these shoes on, you pointed at them, and I go, God damn it.  I didn't think you were going to see me wearing these.  And you go, well, you only thought you were going on a three-hour tour.  I wish I would have had that clever reference this time in saying, Gilligan Island. 
[01:06:00]  Skipper.  So if you have a dewey in the States, it's a felony here.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  If it's considered a felony here, it doesn't matter if it's on your record.  How do they fucking even know these things when you go up to the border?  I have no idea how they knew.  And with all this shit flying across the fucking Mexican border, they ought to just leave the Canadian border alone.  For the love of Christ.  Like, Mexico, drugs, guns, porn each way, fucking illegal immigrants. 
[01:06:30]  And then just some guy that, yeah, had a couple of too many one night.  Right.  And you can't get in.  The reason they, what I've heard from everybody is that it's because we ratcheted up border security, so they, like, fucked us back.  You know?  That's how it happened.  Yeah.  Ooh, you, fuck you, I fuck you.  Yeah, that's kind of, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  The way we're going.  Wow, all right.  I didn't know there was this fucking border war going on with Canada.  Yeah, yeah.  It is a pretty pussy war, though.  Ooh, dewee filling?  Right. 
[01:07:00]  Well, you can't come up here if you've got a fucking parking ticket.  We saw you walking around last night for, like, two seconds, and you ran off to get coffee.  Yeah, I did.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm good.  It's just, here, the whole time when you just wandered around, you just keep running into, you don't really go with a plan.  You just kind of end up hanging out with.  Yeah, we just know so many people up here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you end up, like, because for those food trucks, and it's impossible, because I don't speak French.  You offered food trucks.  I went to a sushi joint.  Oh, okay.  Because that's a, what you end up having to do, what at least I have to do every time, 
[01:07:30]  is I have to translate French stuff into, like, fucking ninth grade Spanish, and then translate that into English.  It's an impossible way to do it.  Oh, I got to, this is kind of a funny story that I meant to share with you guys.  It has nothing to do with Canada, but it just happened to me, like, the other day in Brooklyn,  and I think it's kind of funny.  So, if anybody, Bobby will attest to this, or Joe, you've been in my car before.  I have been in your car.  It's like a fucking recycling center.  You know, it's just a garbage truck.  It literally looks like they pulled it out of the movie Repo Man.  Yeah.  God, Jesus. 
[01:08:00]  It's like, you know, like, yeah, it's like, forget it.  It's like garbage up to your knees.  It's really bad.  Oh, why is it so bad?  Are you like a hoarder?  No, it's just like, I don't, like, I travel in the car.  I don't care about the physical appearance of it, so I just throw garbage.  You know what I mean?  Like, just throw shit into, like, the passenger side.  Yeah, yeah, exactly right.  When I fill up the back seat, I move to the passenger seat.  That's kind of...  Wait, who was the Dallas Cowboy?  Jimmy, you tell that story.  Oh, it was...  Shit.  It was offensive lineman, Alan...  Oh, my...  Larry Allen. 
[01:08:30]  Larry Allen, right.  That Tyson Walter said,  Larry Allen would drive a Mercedes,  and he would chew tobacco,  and he would just spit it onto the rug in the passenger seat.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, that's not...  Isn't that...  That's crazy.  Well, I've done it with, like, cigarette butts that I know are extinguished.  Really?  Just throw them on that?  Yeah.  There's something weird about that.  That's like...  I guess it is kind of a specific kind of person,  because, like, Judah Freelander apparently is like that, too.  Like, there's a guy, a specific kind of guy  that doesn't give a shit about the interior of his car.  Same guy that doesn't give a shit about his appearance  if it's Judah Freelander. 
[01:09:00]  There's a hat that says champ on it  with the fucking Oscars.  So, anyway, so I did this, like, web series thing with a guy,  so I had, like, a bunch of, like, extra bullshit in my car,  like, props and weird,  and, like, I had to drop him off in Brooklyn,  and I'm not that familiar with Brooklyn.  Like, I've lived in Queens for 12 years,  but I never...  So I'm driving back,  and I end up, like, turning the wrong way on a one-way street,  and, like, right next, like, and a cop is right there,  so he pulls me over,  and, uh, oh, and I was racing to a show,  so I had changed my clothes in my car, 
[01:09:30]  which is another weird...  So there's, like, an extra set of clothes.  Oh.  And, because I'm racing,  I pissed in a vitamin water bottle, right?  So, because...  I've done the...  Oh, that's easy.  Right?  That's easy, yeah.  But I didn't dump it.  It was just sitting there,  like, on top of the pile of garbage, right?  Oh, God.  So cops pull me over,  and the one guy's talking to me at the driver's side.  The passenger, he's, like, looking in,  and he goes,  do you live in your car?  And it was, like, really kind of an eye-opening,  and I was, like, no.  I know it looks that way, but I don't.  And so they're, like...  And also, it's Brownsville,  which is, like, a pretty bad neighborhood, 
[01:10:00]  and I'm, like, a squirrely-eyed white guy,  so they, like, get me out of the car  because they want to search it,  and picks up a hot bottle of piss,  and he goes,  you don't live in your car.  And I go, no, I know that it seems like I do,  but I don't...  And while they're searching it,  these, like, three, like, kind of sketchy black dudes,  like, they walk, and they start...  They're, like, trying to be my legal team.  They're, like, yo,  they don't got probable cars.  Like, they start yelling at me.  Yeah, yeah.  They're, like,  you don't gotta let them search your shit, son.  They don't got probable cars.  You know, they keep... 
[01:10:30]  They need a warrant, right?  And I'm, like, fellas, thanks.  I appreciate your help, but I got this.  And, like, the cops are, like, move on, right?  And that's how...  You can put us on retainer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, they keep shouting legal advice at me.  Yeah, great.  And then the cops,  because I told you I was doing a video,  I have a plastic human skull in the backseat from...  It was, like, a Hamlet reference, right?  It was the reason I had...  But it looks just like a human...  The cop pulls it out.  He goes,  What the fuck is this?  Right?  He pulls it out of the car.  The three black dudes go,  Yo, he a serial killer! 
[01:11:00]  They totally, like,  turned on the side of the cops.  They're, like,  Arrest that motherfucker!  It was pretty interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just funny.  A skull and piss in your car.  Yeah, that's, like,  two out of the three  of the homicidal triad.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the trunk should have  rope and duct tape in there.  Right, right.  Yeah.  I just start lighting matches,  just throwing them on the ground.  Because fire's the third one.  It doesn't matter.  Yes.  It's not important.  There's a couple of very pretty girls here. 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  I love that.  I'm very happy.  Yes.  You want to talk to them, Jimmy?  Yeah, basically.  Yeah.  You want to just get to know them a little bit?  We should get to know the audience a little bit.  We like that.  Say hello to them a little bit.  Denny says we should engage the audience.  Engage the audience with swag and make them feel...  What, throw frisbees at them or something?  We should have brought,  apparently, we should have brought frisbees.  Frisbees.  Because Denny thinks frisbees are the best thing  to throw out to the audience.  I'm convinced I'm supposed to marry that girl right there.  Oh, shit.  I'm convinced.  Is that your chick, dude? 
[01:12:00]  Well, I think it's his chick.  What?  Just a friend.  Is that your chick, dude?  Me, no.  No.  All right.  Oh, boy.  How did you get sandwiched between those two motherfuckers?  Just luck.  Just dumb luck, huh?  Just dumb luck.  Wow.  So do you think that Joe thinks he's destined to marry you?  Well, I really like your new tattoo.  Thank you.  It's not very becoming.  I don't want to keep on bringing it back to the tattoo,  but I really like it.  Oh, can you butter me up, sweetie?  You're sitting next to two guys with, like, full professional sleeves? 
[01:12:30]  And actual male bodies.  Right.  Jeez, you'd think they'd give the girls some room.  They're, like, on your lap.  They insist that they can't move over anymore, but I just, I don't know.  Yeah, huh?  Oh, boy.  Star-studded walking through the door.  Oh, my God.  There's some big stars walking through the door right now.  Big stars.  Stars coming through the door.  You're supposed to be fucking sarcastic when we come in. 
[01:13:00]  Of course.  Big stars coming in.  Go fuck yourself.  What's your name, dear?  That's Colin.  Oh, okay.  My name's Dana.  Dana, and you're from Montreal?  Ottawa.  Ottawa.  Yes.  Ah, okay.  How far is that?  Two hours.  About two hours?  All right.  And what do you do there?  I'm a yoga receptionist, so. 
[01:13:30]  You're just the one that checks the people in?  Yeah, they won't even let me in the studio.  Do you do yoga?  Yep.  Oh, you could tell.  Ah, thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, do you?  That yoga body.  No, I work out.  I try to stay healthy.  I've done a little yoga.  Could you do some yoga?  What's that?  Downward dog.  Can you show what a downward dog is?  Hold on, hold on.  You want this.  Trust me.  I shit my pants trying the warrior.  Hold on.  You want her to do this.  Could you show us what the downward facing dog is, please?  This is a photo op for everybody. 
[01:14:00]  Photo op.  Can you please?  My parents love me very much.  I don't know if they want this on the head.  What?  It's a yoga thing.  What's the yoga pose?  We would never ask you to do anything inappropriate.  Oh, no?  No, no.  It's an official yoga pose.  Wait, wait.  You wanted to hook up with Joe, so you apparently hate your dad.  How much could you possibly love your parents?  Jesus, Jesse.  Well, no, Jesse, if Joe wanted to hook up with her, it wasn't necessarily that she wanted  to.  No, I'm not trying to cockball him.  I'm just saying that was bad.  Oh, my God.  No, Jim's absolutely right. 
[01:14:30]  I disgustingly threw myself.  Joe said that he's probably destined to marry her, and I'm like, fine, but if you want a  bigger one-bedroom.  As the two males vie for the female's attention.  Yes, the rich guy with the pool swoops in and takes her.  I like, too, how used to hard reactions Jesse's used to seeing women have from me, because  he's like, well, she didn't vomit, Joe, so she doesn't hook up right here.  There's a plus working, Joe.  You're in, man. 
[01:15:00]  You're in.  You guys want to see the pose or what?  I do, yes.  You've got to see the pose.  Oh, yeah.  It's an official yoga pose.  There's nothing dirty about it.  All right.  You usually have to warm up, so I don't want anybody to try this.  I'm not warming up, sure.  I'm trying to show off to your friends.  All right.  So she'll get in the front.  Dang, that's lovely.  A dog.  Yeah.  All right.  Very lovely.  And, oh, man, yeah.  She's got her hands posed.  Oh, wow.  Very straight legs.  That was for you, Joe.  Very good.  That was for you, Joe. 
[01:15:30]  That's beautiful.  What do you do there?  What do you do for fun there in Ottawa?  There is a huge bar culture, actually.  I was looking for things outside the bar culture, not so much.  Yeah.  We have a river and a canal.  Whoa.  Damn.  Two straight bodies of water.  Oh, my God.  How many wonderful songs have been written about either?  Two fine places to dump a body.  And any gentlemen in your life at this moment? 
[01:16:00]  My boyfriend, Elliot.  Ew.  Where is he?  He's at home.  He's seethingly jealous.  Why is he jealous?  He didn't bounce on the...  Because a room full of guys wants to fuck her?  All right.  He does a good job answering that question.  But, I mean, why is he...  Of what?  You're not doing anything inappropriate.  No, not...  No, I just...  No, just jealous of being here.  He's a very big fan of the show.  He wants to be here. 
[01:16:30]  Why isn't he here?  He didn't jump on the opportunity, the Facebook offer to...  Just think of what a prize it would be to take a host's come home with you.  Yes.  In your hair and in your pocket.  In your pocket.  Hey, look, Elliot.  This is on my shoe.  I'm...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We're teasing, of course.  You're very...  You're very lovely.  Yeah, we would never do anything...  How old a gal are you, by the way?  I'm 24. 
[01:17:00]  Yes, you are.  Oh, wonderful.  Jesus.  What does Elliot do for work?  Oh.  He's an artist.  Oh, no.  No, a legitimate one.  We call them faggots.  What kind of art?  What kind of art does he do?  He's probably broke.  He's probably broke.  You're an artist.  Starving artist.  Yeah, you don't need that.  Yeah, what do you support him?  No, no.  He just finished drawing backgrounds for Jeff Foxworthy's new cartoon.  That is probably going to bomb, but...  Oh, wow. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, no.  But it's not Elliot's fault.  Nice endorsement.  I'm sure.  Wow.  He draws the backgrounds for Foxworthy's cartoon?  Yes.  All right.  Because when I think art, I think Foxworthy cartoons.  Yeah.  And not even the foreground, the background.  So, in other words, he draws that thing that just repeats every time he runs.  Like a Flintstones house.  Picasso actually did that for the Flintstones.  A lot of people don't know that.  Did he?  Yeah.  It was just one little picture that just kept me running.  Big hit.  And I pictured this guy, like, in bare feet over a tarp. 
[01:18:00]  Just fucking flinging paint.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  Oh, that's...  So, he's looking forward to those checks, I bet.  Right?  Right.  The lucrative Foxworthy checks.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.  And in the meantime, the old yoga receptionist's job has to fucking pay the bills.  That's right.  You deserve better than that.  Absolutely.  You do.  You really do.  What sort of things do I deserve?  Yeah, how about a pool, a movie theater?  Do you have a life-size dinosaur?  I have.  Oddly enough, I have a life-size velociraptor. 
[01:18:30]  It resides right next to the jacuzzi.  Yes.  And he has another dinosaur, his political ideology.  You know, Ann, all that pool and theater stuff is nice, but I think women tend to care for  a more understated gentleman.  Really?  Like somebody that maybe brings a Nintendo 3DS with him on the road.  Oh, did you?  Maybe a guy that doesn't like to flash the money around with an iPad, but more of a Kindle 
[01:19:00]  kind of thing upstairs.  Yeah, girls love that.  Absolutely.  Not flashing the money around.  Jesus.  He can't compete.  I mean, the fucking cock and two balls is just the pool, the theater, and the house.  Let me tell you what I based my whole life on.  I went to an NRA auction once, and I wanted the matched pistols.  I wasn't going to stop bidding until I won it.  That's how I run my life. 
[01:19:30]  I will outbid you on anything, Joe.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Wow.  It just got real.  What is this, the fucking showdown?  Right.  I just figuratively pissed on her.  I will say that.  A girl like that now might say, I don't want to be seen as something that can be bid on.  I have to make a decision to maybe, you know, just to make the real guy jealous.  You know, you blow the third mic.  And that's why you'd want to do that.  But then he's like, ah, and he bids higher.  Because I want to take AIDS home to my boyfriend. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, what a gift.  How long are you with Elliot?  I'm sure you have a healthy relationship.  It's been about five and a half years.  Wow.  And you're 24?  Yeah, gross.  Oh, you're fucking doomed.  There's no way you're going to marry this guy because you're together too long at too  young an age.  He says the same thing.  It's so weird.  How old is he?  He's 61.  Was he your first?  No.  Whoa. 
[01:20:30]  No.  Now we're all like, all right, how do I ask that next question?  That's seeming like a story.  I'll get to it.  How old were you when you had your first?  How old?  I was in high school.  I was in high school.  15.  All right.  I would say 16, yeah.  We're very liberal up here.  Oh, yeah?  That's our thing.  Yeah.  We don't have, you know, we don't teach abstinence in school.  Yeah.  Or do not fuck children. 
[01:21:00]  No abstinence or anything.  It's like, yeah, whatever we want.  It feels good.  Do it.  Love the one you're with.  All that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  Boy, that guy must have gotten a treat, though.  Fucking first time.  Nice.  Nice.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Oh, God.  He forgot he's broadcasting.  Oh, she shaved for me. 
[01:21:30]  No, it just hasn't come in yet.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Sure.  Like I'm chastising him for being a creep.  Yeah.  You didn't bring a yearbook I could stick my dick in, did you?  Should we seat our other guests?  Yeah, we've got to get Tom Papa.  Of course we should.  Thank you so much.  We'll be getting back to you.  Where's Colin?  I don't think you're getting off this easy.  He left?  Yeah.  Why?  He was just checking it out. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, Colin.  What happened?  I saw Colin at the, good morning, fellas.  Hi, buddy.  I saw Colin at the coffee shop across the way.  He'd been there for over an hour already.  Oh, is he writing?  He's writing.  He's doing the big keynote address today.  Oh, that's right.  Here at the festival, and he is nervous.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's a great writer, though.  He is a good writer.  Is he gone now?  Yeah, he just went back.  We wanted to get him on mic, at least.  What's that?  He said he's coming back tomorrow.  Oh, I know.  But I wanted to ask him about the keynote speech for today. 
[01:22:30]  That's impressive.  He said he had a lot of work to do.  Oh, okay.  He's under a lot of pressure.  There have been two good ones over the years.  Yeah, Patton and Mark Maron.  Is that today?  It's today at 1 o'clock.  Oh, we've got to go to that.  Yeah.  Hey, how was the flight with Roland?  Oh.  No one ended up on your flight.  What a treat with Roland.  Nothing like flying with Roland.  Yeah.  He's a good egg.  Yeah, he is a good egg and shaped like an egg.  He's the loudest man on the plane. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, always.  I was sitting next to this beautiful black French girl, French-Canadian girl, and she's  very soft-spoken, and Roland's behind me going, he's got the exit row.  There was a woman sat down, a woman sat down with two children, and immediately he starts  playing.  They're not old enough.  Not like...  Hey, I'm so sick of hearing that.  He's not saying it to anyone. 
[01:23:30]  He's just saying it out loud like someone else had said it.  I don't think that's safe.  So they come and they re-seat him, and he's like, they're like, I'm not sure if you can,  if your children are...  I can sit there.  I can switch with them.  So he switches to right behind me, and I'm talking to this girl, and she's very attractive  and very soft-spoken, and he's just yelling, if the plane goes down, we've got to get superstar  Tom Poppa off the plane immediately.  And people...  I mean, he's addressing the whole plane. 
[01:24:00]  He's like, do you know him?  I'm like, I've never seen him before in my life.  I have no idea.  Call security.  He fell asleep instantly.  Yeah.  Did you get my photo that I sent you this morning?  Yes, yes.  We retweeted it.  Oh, okay, good.  I can't even fault him with that, because I'm one of those two.  I could just crap right out, fall asleep on a plane.  Yeah.  It's the best thing.  You're in a time machine.  You're just like...  Oh, we're here.  It's great.  Meanwhile, everybody else is like, oh, my God, I had to live through it.  When you sleep and wake up, it's fucking great. 
[01:24:30]  I used to do that with drunk driving.  It was great.  Right?  I just wake up and be...  Hey, I'm home.  I'm in my driveway.  That's funny.  You black out, you wake up, you have a little bit of blood under your fingernail.  You're like, yes, I had a good time.  A little pink leather shoe in your grill?  Yeah.  A pink bicycle?  Oh, no.  Why is there a Hello Kitty backpack in my grill?  And a wig with fucking red paste under it.  But it was good being with Roland. 
[01:25:00]  It's nice to have a little friend on your way into another country.  Yeah, a little reference point.  We got so lucky with Colin was on our flight.  Amy Schumer.  I fell asleep, by the way, and Colin woke me up.  I dozed off, and I finally fell asleep.  He never sleeps on plane.  Never.  And the fucking stupid Colin turns around with his headphones and whizzes them into my chest.  He's just such a treat.  I fell asleep while we were still taxiing to the runway, and then Jimmy decides he's going to gently shut the shade on the window. 
[01:25:30]  He fucking slammed it down and woke me up.  I didn't mean to wake you.  I was trying to be quiet.  Yes, you did.  But you don't want a plane window.  You close it, and it's really, they have to pull, pull, pull.  And then it's like, that last pull makes a loud noise, and it didn't wake you.  I thought an engine exploded.  And then, of course, the gas, the noxious gas that he put out in that plane was terrible.  And proud of it.  Like, most people would be embarrassed.  He's like, yeah, it was me. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  And the stewardess is walking down the aisle, and he doesn't even lean over and says, he goes, you think she smelt it?  I dropped such a fucking putrid gasser in the bathroom.  And the pilot went right in after to use it, and I was embarrassed.  I was actually embarrassed.  He came out and said he's now not physically able to fly the aircraft.  Yeah, he started yelling, Allahu Akbar.  By coincidence, I ended up on a flight home from Vegas next to Jimmy. 
[01:26:30]  Just by coincidence, we both ended up sitting next to each other.  And halfway through the flight, Jimmy, you know, he's got his headphones on.  He's got a blanket up.  He's got the whole system, the neck pillow, the whole thing.  And he just taps me on the shoulder, lowers the blanket, and just looks at me and smiles.  And this gas just came across.  It's the worst.  I forgot.  I have a neck pillow, and Colin took it.  And he goes, let me see that. 
[01:27:00]  And then he put it on the floor, and he puts his feet on it.  He goes, oh, this is comfortable.  And Amy took his bag.  It was on the floor, and she goes, oh, let me, I'll put this up for you.  So she takes it up, and she walks it all the way to the back of the plane.  And put it in the carry-on at the back of the plane.  Yeah, now deal with that when we land.  It was a good move.  It's just a bunch of pricks.  And then apparently Amy had those piss-yellow fucking slide-on shoes she wears occasionally. 
[01:27:30]  And Jimmy felt compelled, you know, like those.  Wow.  Oh, another pretty girl with yellow shoes.  Those are the shoes.  Like, greenish-yellow.  I guess they're attractive up here.  Oh.  I'm kidding.  You're a very lovely girl.  Let's talk to her, too.  Yeah, let's talk to her.  And Jimmy felt compelled to snap pictures of them and post them on Twitter as the ugliest shoes he's ever seen.  And he followed Amy through the airport until she stopped.  Amy was covering up and not letting me get pictures of her shoes. 
[01:28:00]  She was hiding behind her luggage, so I followed her.  Because Colin is such a fucking zilch.  He travels with his suit jacket and a hanger.  There's no bag for it.  He's just carrying it like a fucking homeless guy.  So I followed them to the store, and I snapped pictures of her horrible bowling shoes.  And they did kind of, eh, a little bit.  Yeah.  Hers were worse.  Amy's were worse than yours.  Sam, let's talk to the...  Yeah, get a mic over there.  The lovely couple.  Are you with her?  I am.  Are you the husband? 
[01:28:30]  The boyfriend, yes.  Boyfriend?  Yes.  Oh, what's your name?  I'm Chris.  Chris?  From Toronto.  And what's your name, dear?  I'm Denise.  Denise.  Chris and Denise.  Oh, she wants to hold the mic.  I'm trying to make things more comfortable for Sam.  Trying to make things comfortable for Sam and then grow a penis.  So you're from Toronto?  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  Welcome.  Thank you for...  It's a nice ride.  You're here just for this? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Thank you.  I was telling Sam we did the Patrice benefit, too.  So we're actually planning our vacations around what you guys are doing.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Bus trip is up next.  Oh, yeah.  In September.  Sure it is.  Oh, that's cool.  What do you do?  Either one.  I work in financial services.  Oh.  Tell them the company.  What the hell does that mean?  Tell them the company.  Chris wants her to tell us the company.  Financial services.  American Express.  Oh.  Oh.  And travel points. 
[01:29:30]  You have that up here?  Yes, we have that up here.  You would assume, but...  What do you do, sir?  I'm in group insurance.  Wow.  What a power couple.  You guys are like...  Oh, cocktail party conversations?  People just nodding off?  And then I saw a fucking statement that said...  I said the indemnification isn't what it's supposed to be.  That's good.  That's good.  How long have you been together? 
[01:30:00]  Sarah, did you say?  Three and a half years.  Three and a half years.  She knows.  Oh, God.  Why not any marriage?  What happened?  Oh, she's pointing at him.  Oh, shit.  She just pushed the mic.  I should throw me out of the bus there.  I know.  You know, you got to take your time.  Make the right decisions.  Get to know each other.  After three and a half years, if you're not sure we should be married or not, maybe we should  be together.  Well, you got to learn from your experiences, right?  Ah, yeah.  No, don't listen to my experiences.  If you ever even want to get married at any point in your life. 
[01:30:30]  You wouldn't do it again?  No.  Fucking nightmare.  Oh.  To just take your money, bitch at you.  I don't know.  You look like a nice enough girl.  Right?  They all look nice before you put a ring on their fucking fingers.  Attaboy, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Joe DeRosa.  And they're taking your group insurance money.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Imagine some lawyer sitting next to her saying things like, and your potential future earnings 
[01:31:00]  in the financial industry.  Oh, you want to fucking crack them both.  Yeah, except the difference is the lawyer would have a fucking white wig on.  Yes, that's true.  They do have those white wigs.  Do they wear them up here?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  I saw a commercial for CSI UK, I guess.  They have that here.  And they show everything from CSI.  They're doing things and checking.  And then they go to the court scene.  It's like they got the old powdered wigs on. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  That like pilgrim fucking bolo tie thing.  It's just the worst.  Yeah, yeah.  The ruffly shirt.  I don't want to be a pirate.  I don't want to be a pirate.  Yeah.  Was that Seinfeld?  Of course.  I hope so.  That was the worst Johnny Depp impression ever.  That's good.  You get along with our family?  Yeah.  Oh, you do?  Dad's a great guy.  He owns a sailboat.  Oh, wow.  That's great. 
[01:32:00]  Look at you.  Like an eight-year-old.  He owns a sailboat, and it's pretty.  Yes.  Marrying into the Peterson family.  You know, that sweater got excited when it saw the sweatshirt.  Fuck.  Oh.  You had something.  Wait, the sweater got excited when what?  I was trying to say the sweater.  That looks like a sailing sweater.  It does look like a.  That looks like a Cape Cod kind of thing.  I was trying to get to that.  Right.  Yes, very snooty.  It was very cold when we came up here, so both Denise and I ran to the store to buy sweaters.  Oh, you bought them?  Adorable.  As soon as we got here. 
[01:32:30]  That wasn't that nice.  That is pretty smart.  That's cute.  That guy who makes money, let's go buy sweaters.  Right.  See?  I respect that.  That'll go away if you get married.  Yeah.  How are you not getting married when you're living your life already?  Like, we need sweaters.  Yes, we do.  How does this one look, sweetie?  See?  Now, the yoga girl.  Now, Elliot would probably say, it's cold.  Let's wrap ourselves in old newspapers.  Right.  But she's so bummed.  I'll paint something that looks warm. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll paint a flame.  Fucking artist.  Right.  See?  That's a successful guy right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's fucking in some kind of...  You know, financing.  The more boring the job, the better the pay is.  Right?  Absolutely.  So when are you guys going to get married?  Is it going to happen or what?  Yeah.  You know, in the next couple of years, I guess.  I'm going to throw me out of the bus there.  She's shaking her head.  The next couple of years.  Is that all right with you?  A couple more years? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, no, boy.  A couple more years.  Do you want to have a family and everything?  Yes.  Is that what it is?  Yes.  So you want to have some kids and you're hearing tick-tock, right?  Just one.  Just one?  Just one kid.  Just one.  You want to raise a fucking lunatic.  Only child?  Oh, boy.  They're stable.  Hey, I'm an only child.  Exactly.  Zing.  Zing.  That's right.  Zing Zing. 
[01:34:00]  You have three siblings.  They're all on your arms.  That's what you do.  Oh, that's nice.  I'm glad you came from Toronto to come see us.  Thanks for having us.  No problem.  Front row, too.  Look at that.  How'd you swing that?  Who do you know?  Right?  You wanted front row today.  You had to get here at least five of seven.  All right.  They're a very polite Canadian crowd.  I know.  They really are.  It's so nice.  I thought we should have had something for the audience. 
[01:34:30]  Like, you know, coffee or something.  Oh.  Or donuts.  Or cronuts.  Wait.  Is there a Tim Hortons around here?  Of course there is.  Okay.  Well, why don't we get these people donuts?  I'm buying.  Whoa.  Breaking news.  Wow.  Absolutely.  Go pick up six donuts and a bunch of knives.  And you fucking animals can fight over it on the floor. 
[01:35:00]  Donuts.  The donuts are on Jimmy.  We have to take a break for live read.  No, no, no, no.  The donuts are on the house.  Nice.  Yeah, break up my party.  All right, look.  We got Tom Pop on the couch, Jesse Joyce, Joe DeRosa, and we'll be back live.  By the way, Opie, where's Bob Kelly?  I don't know where Bob Kelly is.  Bob is changed.  I'm doing my podcast, Bobby from the lobby.  He's competing with us, I think.  He was up late last night.  I left at like 2.30. 
[01:35:30]  He was doing someone else's podcast in the lobby.  He had a light on him.  He's like, dude, dude.  I just waved and kept walking.  I thought he said what was going to happen.  Enough with the podcast with this guy.  He's like, everybody walking by, and he's just like, dude, let's get him.  All right, forget it.  Yeah, we were saying that was a mogul, that guy.  That was going to be every fucking thing about his podcast.  People just walking by, and he's trying to get them.  And they would just thought, how he meant that?  Oh, no, he's busy.  He's busy.  All right, we're going to be back live in Montreal at the Just for Less Comedy Festival. 
[01:36:00]  Great crowd today.  And Bob Kelly next, I believe, yes.  Woo!  Live from the world's largest comedy festival,  Just for Less in Montreal.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  More, more, more.  Yes.  Yeah!  Wow.  Is that up?  I don't know.  No, now there's something playing.  Oh, that.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Wow, wow.  Oh, boy.  Wow, wow, wow.  I think we're live now, right?  Yes.  Live from Montreal, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, man.  Great crowd.  We got Tom Papa, Jesse Joyce, and Joe DeRosa on the couch waiting for the arrival of Bob Kelly.  We have another guest here, though.  Oh.  Who?  Chris DiStefano is here.  Oh.  Oh, we got to bring him out.  Yeah, we have to move everybody down one.  What?  And Chris will sit and everybody chats.  Oh, we didn't even really talk to Tom yet.  Yeah.  No, it's okay.  Oh, no.  There's a lot of microphones. 
[01:37:00]  I like the fact that Chris didn't even wait for us, and he just walked out like, fuck it.  They said my name.  I'm waltzing out.  Sam's walking behind him, clapping, trying to get something going on.  Yeah.  Sam is just hype, man.  I'm sorry, Tom.  Good, yeah.  He's hype, man.  We usually move everybody down.  What happened?  That's all right.  Fuck it.  I kind of like this.  Yeah, I don't like it.  How are you?  Hi, Chris.  We're all uncomfortable with how formal this is anyway, so fuck it.  Yeah, moving down is kind of weird.  You don't like it?  No.  It's early for us to get up and move two feet. 
[01:37:30]  And I don't like anybody knowing who came in first, second, third.  I like mixing it up.  Yeah, it's a big secret now.  Yes, very.  It feels like a demotion when you get moved down.  It was.  And I was right about to go to the final seat.  Yeah.  No, no.  The final seat is actually right here.  We have a chair here.  You can't see it.  It has a little fist on it.  So you can choose to take that chair.  Just like the one Jimmy's got.  Absolutely.  Except the fingers are open on mine.  Wow. 
[01:38:00]  So what's up, Chris?  Nothing much, man.  First time up here.  So I feel like, thank you for having me on.  I feel weird that, you know, I didn't mean to, I don't know.  I feel like when I walk in.  Fuck you.  Yeah, thanks.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I just feel like, because I just feel like, because I look like such like a beef head  asshole that I just have to say I'm sorry to everybody when I walk on.  You shouldn't, because you're intimidating.  You're kind of an intimidating guy.  You shouldn't apologize.  You make everybody nervous.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I just want to, you know, I'm sorry to the group. 
[01:38:30]  My triceps hit anybody.  So you go to the, do you go to the, like, hotel gym and everybody just goes, ah, fuck  it, and walks out.  Like, why am I bothering?  No, I mean, I've been doing some cardio.  Jimmy!  Not you!  No, I can start working out again.  I haven't been working out as much.  Oh, obviously.  I put on some weight, so.  Did you?  Fucking, yeah, comedy, man.  You know, a lot of fish fillets.  A road food is not typically known to be very healthy. 
[01:39:00]  It's the worst.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why many comics aren't in the best shape, I'll just say.  I'm not looking at anyone and.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Wow.  It is hard on the road, though, because it's like, it's all shit at two o'clock in the  way.  It's like, we're a fucking fat country, Americans are.  And I'm like, you're in the airport everywhere you go.  It's just garbage.  It's like, I just want to eat something healthy.  Yeah.  That was my fucking boring break.  Obviously you have been.  You look great, Jimmy.  Everybody notices it.  I've just been eating to the gym, going, eating better. 
[01:39:30]  Going to the gym?  Going to the gym and eating better.  Why?  Eating better.  Eating better.  Going to the gym?  It's easy to eat a lot of salads at home, and it's even easy to eat salad and shit like  that on the road.  But like, if you didn't eat all fucking day, and then you did two shows, and you're driving  back to the hotel, it's like, you're not fucking getting a salad at Burger King.  Cheeseburger, motherfucker.  Like, yeah, you need to, like, satiate your hunger.  Sate your hunger?  Sate.  What's satiate mean? 
[01:40:00]  Nothing.  Is that a fake word?  It means like when you feel full.  Satity means you feel full.  What's satiate, though, mean?  That's the verb of it, right?  Yes.  Satiate your hunger.  It's like if she was going to not eat, but she wanted people to think she did.  Oh, Jesus.  That took 30 seconds.  That was a slow roll.  Oh, no. 
[01:40:30]  Dude!  Dude!  You got your coffee, dude!  Dude!  Dude!  Dude!  It's Bobby from the lobby.  Bobby!  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Yes.  Doing my show, Bobby from the lobby.  Do you have fans in Canada?  I know, right?  What's up, fuckers?  Hi, Thin Jim.  Hi, Bobby.  Yeah, Bobby, Kelly. 
[01:41:00]  Everybody's here now.  Weren't we up at fucking four last night?  Yeah.  Why are you so fucking happy?  Me?  Yeah, you were shit-faced last night.  No, I wasn't.  I had two drinks.  Oh.  You kept asking me if I was shit-faced all night.  I wasn't shit-faced.  Because you were happy.  I know.  That is a sign something's wrong.  Yeah, you were in the corner going,  these fucking people, man,  they don't get the fucking industry, dude.  Yeah, was he pontificating?  Was he satiating? 
[01:41:30]  He's saying I wasn't doing that,  so I must have been shit-faced.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, no, it takes a lot.  Yeah, I'm usually trying to form a coup  in the fucking corner at any industry event.  We can take this fucking place.  Come on.  It's actually fun being up here,  and it's like when you first come up,  you're supposed to hate it.  It's like guys who think we're supposed to hate L.A.,  but we wind up liking it.  And it's like we've all been up here before.  This is your first time.  Do you like it,  or are you thinking you should hate it?  I'm nervous, you know,  like around like everybody. 
[01:42:00]  You know, it's intimidating,  but I like it.  I think it's a nice city.  I don't speak French, so.  What did you say?  What are you doing with your hands?  I don't know.  Ever since it was very animated.  You told me two years ago  that I sounded like a gay Joan Rivers  ever since I did that.  Oh, no.  He just...  Bobby just spit.  He just sprayed.  Oh, forgive me,  but normally he comes out of the water to do that.  I'm sorry.  You had to do that one, Jimmy. 
[01:42:30]  You had to do that one.  He fucking spit coffee.  Chris, you do have a little bit  of a fruity quality to you.  I never noticed that.  Wow, Joe.  How great would it be  if Chris just fucking took Jaws,  fucking Jaws,  took Jaws and rented it  and showed it to Joe.  I'm just going off of what Bobby said.  There is a little bit of a gain.  Don't fucking love me.  I don't want to get my ass kicked by wide hips. 
[01:43:00]  No, I wouldn't.  He does have childbearing hips, doesn't he?  I'm disgusted.  I do, I do.  Chris, how does it feel  when people talk to you  in a way they never would  if you weren't in comedy?  It's fine.  I think there's something with my jaw  where my bottom teeth come out further  and it causes a gay lisp, I think.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  That's covered in cum.  Yeah, that's a dick in the ass.  You're like Rachel Jantel.  Yeah, it's something weird.  I sound like a moron  because of my underbite. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sure you do.  Decorating a town  with a tuna for $40.  You don't sound gay to me.  What?  I was just repeating  the conversation I've had  with myself in the mirror.  I don't know.  Maybe it's my hair.  I got some product in.  I don't know.  It's good.  I combed it back.  I don't know.  I can't put my finger in  why you're gay.  I don't know.  You're a funny fucking comic, man. 
[01:44:00]  I only worked with Chris once  at Caroline's.  You went up and did time before me.  I didn't know you.  I was like,  this cocksucker is killing.  It was irritating.  Really fucking funny.  And who would heckle, right?  Thanks, man.  Just come down there  and fucking clock him in the head.  Anyone else, motherfuckers?  Everyone's just sitting there  all petrified.  He's not that big.  I know.  What are you fucking talking about?  Look at his arms.  He's a big guy.  What the fuck?  He's not eight feet tall.  He's a regular white guy.  His head is small.  You don't have to be a tall guy. 
[01:44:30]  Look at Mike Tyson.  He was a little fireplug.  Yeah.  This guy's fucking,  you could tell.  Chris, look at him.  And in a comedy environment.  Kick ass, right?  How can you guys tell?  You guys have never,  neither one of you  been in a fucking fight.  Why Bob's so angry at us?  I'm sorry.  It's nine o'clock.  I'm sorry.  He comes in with his sunglasses  like he's at a poker championship.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, no, go ahead.  The professional wants to talk again.  Go ahead.  Sort of racist state trooper.  Where's your plant, your milk?  Yeah.  I scratched my cornea. 
[01:45:00]  What?  What happened?  I don't know.  I've been doing a podcast.  What were you doing when I left?  Don't come wrong.  Don't make it serious  because it's bomb.  No.  He did.  He was like,  oh, whoa.  He totally did.  You're all kidding aside.  Jokes are jokes,  but you know,  this is a health issue.  The blindness is no laughing at her.  Apparently not. 
[01:45:30]  By the way,  do we have donuts for the audience?  Can we just bring them in?  We don't need it to be official.  I mean,  we have food for the audience.  We can bring them in for the comics.  I feel bad we don't have anything for them.  I want to give the donuts a lot.  Jimmy bought donuts for the crowd.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.  But I mean,  while we're talking,  now we don't have to stop the show.  He's a nice guy.  But he is a big dude.  Chris is a fucking,  he's like a scary wrestler build.  He's got a fucking like all-American wrestler.  He's not like cut defined,  but like he's a fucking,  he'll put you through a wall bill.  He would be a problem.  Yeah, Chris,  I was kidding.  No, no,  you can beat him.  I don't care.  I was,  he's a very, 
[01:46:00]  his background is,  did you ever hear about his father?  No.  No.  Oh, God.  Chris,  tell him about your father.  About my dad?  Um, well, uh,  my dad, uh,  he's one of those guys,  like nobody ever really knew what he did for a living,  you know?  Oh, shit.  Everything was,  you know,  cash always.  He was in prison,  you know,  for the first 10 years of my life.  You know,  he's like type of guy,  like, you know,  when I told him I was coming up here,  he was like,  why don't you go blow a croissant,  you pussy,  you know?  Like he just abuses me all the time.  And, uh,  he's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  But, uh,  he's a great guy. 
[01:46:30]  But, uh,  you know,  he's just, um,  he, uh,  you know,  he,  he used to like threaten to beat the shit out of,  uh,  I went to an old boy Catholic high school.  He used to like threaten to beat the shit out of the,  you know,  the brothers and teachers if I didn't get good grades.  And he was like a really very intimidating.  I think that's what I get that.  I'm not,  cause I grew up with my mother.  My parents were divorced.  So,  you know,  I'm like,  was like an intellectual.  I went to school and everything.  And,  but my,  uh,  father was just like this mafioso criminal guy.  Yeah.  So Chris,  Chris is basically a psychopath because he's really wants to be a nice guy. 
[01:47:00]  Like he's so doesn't want.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's just rage under there.  That's a fucking,  that's a guy who's a major fucking problem.  Yeah.  I've only really been in one fight my whole life.  And I,  I hit the kid overhead with a bat,  but I didn't want to,  you know what I mean?  But I just fucking snapped.  That's the only thing I ever did.  You had to,  you were walking around,  you were making a speech and,  uh,  you know,  the untouchables father taught you a few things.  Yeah,  definitely had a swing of bat,  but I don't think he's,  he hasn't gotten in trouble in a few years.  So that's good.  That's a really scary thing.  He just said too. 
[01:47:30]  He goes,  I didn't want to,  I hit the kid over the head with a bat.  That's the kind of guy,  like he's standing over the unconscious guy going,  look what you made me do.  Yeah.  Look what you made me do.  It's not my fault.  That's the only time though.  One time.  That's a big time,  Chris.  That's a big one time.  Yeah,  but he,  the kid was all right.  You know,  I hit him in like a,  a harder spot of his head.  Oh,  that was nice.  Wow.  That was nice that you thought about it.  Yeah.  He knows where to hit.  Yeah,  there's a pretty huge gap between hitting someone with a bat one time and zero times.  That's the end of the game. 
[01:48:00]  He told me I had a gay lisp,  so I went nuts.  Oh,  look what just walked in.  Oh yeah,  speaking of sociopaths,  Kurt Metzger just fucking walked in the room.  Oh wow.  We were telling his rape joke on the street,  me,  Jesse,  and Gary Goleman at like two in the morning,  just walking,  telling Kurt Metzger's rape joke.  You know,  just talking about rape like we do.  Just talking about a funny,  funny joke.  And then we hear a homeless guy just go,  there is no God. 
[01:48:30]  Well,  if you don't know,  if you don't know Kurt's rape joke,  I'll tell you.  Kurt goes,  yeah,  girl got raped.  I'm just kidding.  That's not it.  God,  I just made that up.  Let's get Kurt out here.  Where is he?  He's back there.  Maybe he's making his way to Joe to the couch.  There he is.  Kurt.  Kurt Metzger.  Being led out by our producer,  Sam Roberts.  Our line producer.  The hype man.  What a full couch.  That about does it for the couch, 
[01:49:00]  right?  Well,  that's it.  Joe,  you know what that means.  I know.  One more comic.  I know.  That's the thanks I get for being down here.  You're the first guy.  You're the first guy.  Well,  you know,  we got that seat right up there.  I'm going to sit right there.  Put a nice fist in my hiney hole.  So welcome to another taping of white guys from New York.  What's up,  Kurt?  Yeah.  Thanks for bringing that rape joke up.  Oh,  what is the joke? 
[01:49:30]  We were saying it's the best rape joke in comedy.  Yeah.  Like if they,  if rape jokes,  he said,  if rape jokes were banned,  that one should be allowed.  Yeah.  Oh,  wow.  That would a compliment.  Oh,  did you not want them to bring that up?  They brought it up.  I didn't bring it up.  Is it bad?  No,  I'm not.  He's kidding.  I just woke up.  I'm not good.  Oh,  he's tired.  What's the joke,  Bobby?  Yeah.  It's just,  he's right here.  I know,  but it looks like he's not ready to talk yet.  It's hard for him to do it.  I'll do it.  It's funny when I do his jokes.  Kurt's tired from Perry.  Any but your own. 
[01:50:00]  Come on,  I can love you.  How many guns did you sneak across the border?  I feel naked.  How many guns and 19-year-olds did you get across?  I'm unarmed.  I did 19 to help you out.  Thank you.  That's the man act.  That's the man act.  That's kidnapping.  It was actually two nine-and-a-half-year-olds. 
[01:50:30]  All right,  back to rape.  You want to hear a rape joke?  Yeah,  let's hear it,  Kurt.  Please.  Well,  I don't know if they,  in Canada,  they have like,  is it degrees?  Is there like first and third degree rape here?  In the States,  they break it,  it is,  which way they break into Greece.  So you can have like third,  Lawrence Taylor got charged with third degree rape.  And I don't think it's just like,  how would there be degrees of that?  Because it's an either or crime,  you know?  Like how do you break it up?  How do you ask somebody that that happened to you? 
[01:51:00]  Like,  ma'am,  I know this is hard for you.  Can you please score your rape?  One to three.  One being like a gold medal.  You know,  old fashioned meat and potatoes,  raping.  And then three being,  it's a little bit your fault,  but like,  it's not your fault.  But it's not your fault.  I just mean,  if you put it against the one.  And that's not even making fun of rape,  that's making fun of the judicial system's interpretation of rape. 
[01:51:30]  That's how everyone would see it.  But that's a great joke.  It is.  I don't even do it anymore.  It's on my album.  It's very funny.  Well,  I'll be doing it on the gala Sunday night.  What gala are you doing,  Jimmy?  Oh,  it's not important.  Whitney Cummings,  live HBO.  It's not important.  Oh,  wow.  All right.  I have a great opening joke up here,  too.  I go up and I go,  hey,  I said to some guy,  how you doing?  He answered me in French.  I'm like,  look, 
[01:52:00]  it's killing.  That would be great.  Hey,  wow.  Okay.  Oh,  yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Sorry.  All right.  So who wants to talk?  I'm probably,  I'm tired.  It's okay,  Jimmy.  Yeah,  I'm sleepy.  I like that.  I've heard his cornea.  I scratch my eye.  Yeah,  we were getting into that.  Bobby,  let's go back to the eye.  How did you,  you can't not know how you scratch your cornea.  It came right at your eye.  I did it on a pillow,  Anthony.  What?  I don't know.  You're asking for something.  I gave you something. 
[01:52:30]  That's a lie,  though.  Well,  who,  if you scratch the back of your head,  you'll be like,  ah,  what was that?  The thing that scratched you came for your eyeball.  You saw it the second before it scratched your eye.  What was it?  Don't get so mad.  I don't know any of the frigging kids.  I,  I don't know.  It's an,  it's like a little,  right before you went,  ow,  what did you see?  A pillow. 
[01:53:00]  It's a fucking the ass joke.  It's a Kurt's face.  No,  listen,  I don't,  I think I did it in my sleep.  I think I,  I,  my eye was open and it like,  you know,  the,  the corner of the pillow while I was sleeping,  sliced your corner,  your eyes open.  like Liberace.  Liberace.  Is that what you said?  Yes.  That's from the movie there. 
[01:53:30]  Who was in that movie?  you remember that?  Oh yeah,  I was in that movie.  That's from playing yourself.  Yes.  Tom was the lifestyle consultant.  Liberace.  He wouldn't shave his legs back then.  Were you supposed to be a little swishy in that movie?  I asked,  I asked,  Steven Soderbergh met my character.  He told him,  Tom,  you got to man it up a little bit.  I asked him, 
[01:54:00]  he went and met the guy that I played,  Ray Arnett.  And I said,  so was he gay?  And Soderbergh said,  you're much gayer than he is.  And yes,  he is gay.  Oh,  okay.  Yeah,  yeah.  I wasn't quite sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just put on paisley pants and that was it.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  You're a good actor though.  Great man.  Yeah.  Thanks Jimmy.  Tom is a great actor.  Crazy movie,  man.  Anything else in the,  the old movie?  I just did the Chris Rock movie.  The new Chris Rock movie.  Yeah,  we did that.  Yeah.  What the fuck is this movie everybody's in? 
[01:54:30]  We did that.  Are you in it?  No.  Oh,  finally,  someone who's not in it.  You go around and I'm wanting to sound cool.  I'm in the Chris Rock movie like,  yeah,  me too.  Me too.  It's finally to be on a couch with people who aren't in it.  It'd make me feel a little better.  Everybody's in it.  Rachel Feinstein's in it.  You're in it,  Jimmy.  Yeah.  How did you get it?  We all show's in it.  We all show is in there.  We interviewed his character.  Where the fuck was I?  We tried to get you on and you were busy.  Yeah,  you're probably doing a podcast.  You're a podcast.  I don't do my podcast at fucking eight in the morning. 
[01:55:00]  You're pod.  Yeah.  When are you doing it here?  I hear it right after this.  Do we go into your podcast?  Right here.  I'm doing it right here.  They take all this down.  And it says,  you know what,  dude?  What?  In this room?  Right?  This comes off and my shit is behind it.  Can we keep our stuff up?  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  I do it.  I do it after.  It was a solid.  What'd you say?  It was a solid.  I don't know.  Just let it sit there.  One more time.  Let it sit there. 
[01:55:30]  One more time.  Shut up.  That reminds me of my midget show earlier.  Yes.  How are the,  oh,  we got some donuts down there.  I could use one of those.  I haven't eaten anything all day.  Are they?  I wanted to have some eggs this morning,  and then they brought me out fucking two goddamn frozen eggs.  Hold on.  I just,  I wanted,  the photographer just run over to snap a photo of the donuts.  It's not an event happening here.  It's not an Asian girl running with napalm on her back in 1970. 
[01:56:00]  Jesus.  I'm very excited.  Fucking,  oh my God,  the donut picking up.  Quick,  capture that.  Capture it.  Oh my God.  Who is he?  Who are you,  sir?  Who are you working for?  Getty.  Getty.  Oh,  nice.  Oh,  all right.  Getty.  Getty.  Bobby,  the Chris Rock movie,  they do a big scene at the end at the comedy cellar.  Really?  Yeah,  at the cellar,  and Artie's on,  Artie,  in the script,  Artie's on stage hosting,  because Chris, 
[01:56:30]  it kind of comes back to stand-up comedy,  and he comes to the cellar.  It's like the big final scene.  It's a good way to blow the movie.  Oh,  geez,  don't assume it.  And,  you know,  it's really cool,  and he's dead through the whole movie.  He comes back.  He just blew the movie just to mess with me.  Good job.  No,  but I'm saying that you have an opportunity to still get in it.  Okay,  just pass me one of those friggin' donuts,  would you?  Bobby.  Bobby.  I shouldn't have a donut?  I had a couple of munchkins,  and I feel very guilty.  Yeah?  Aw.  Yeah.  Yeah,  that's,  what?  No,  it's code words,  but how child molesters talk. 
[01:57:00]  Oh,  my God.  Bobby's just so much.  Why is Riley laughing at that joke?  Oh,  no.  Oh,  my God,  there's a little girl here.  Hi,  what are you,  nuts?  I didn't know she was here.  No,  I'm talking to the father.  Oh,  that's not the father.  Travis is the father.  That's how I was pointing at it,  Travis.  Who's that guy?  Grandfather.  Oh,  okay.  Grandfather.  He looks young to be the grandfather.  Oh,  how about that?  Hi.  Grandfather,  he's supposed to watch the kid,  and he brings her here.  I just sang, 
[01:57:30]  I just sang hi,  and the grandfather went,  hi,  guys,  I'm not talking,  I'm talking to the kid.  It's nothing she hasn't heard at home.  Hi,  grandpa.  Oh,  my God.  How are you?  Who's a good grandpa?  Hi,  Riley.  Let's get her to talk on the mic.  Riley,  say hi to everyone.  Hi,  God.  Hi.  Hi.  How's it going,  douchebags?  It's all right.  That's Travis's kid. 
[01:58:00]  All right,  enough.  Let her have a good time.  I'm Uncle Paul.  Be nice.  Yeah,  daddy works for a dirty show.  Can I tell that story that you were telling me about getting your baby picture?  When we were on the phone the other day,  where you got the baby pictures done?  I guess you can now, 
[01:58:30]  Joe.  Yeah,  Joe.  You think these assholes are going to let it go?  They have nothing to talk about.  They just brought up my podcast for the first time ever.  When's your podcast?  Tell us.  Talk to us.  Don't tell them if it's going to embarrass Bobby.  No,  no,  I won't.  Yeah,  if you don't want me to tell it,  I won't tell it.  Shut up.  Tell it.  I'm kidding.  Tell it.  Oh,  my God.  You think I meant that?  I can't tell.  Tell the story,  Joe.  I called the other day.  I go,  what are you doing?  He goes,  dude,  I'm going upstate.  And I go,  we're going to go do this, 
[01:59:00]  this.  And I go,  okay,  cool.  And he goes,  then we're going to Bailey J's house to take pictures with the baby.  Oh,  no.  Wow.  And I go,  can you give this kid a fighting fucking chance to not be the piece of shit that we are?  And he goes,  she's not going to be in the pictures,  asshole.  Her husband's going to take him.  Even so.  Well,  he's a good photographer and he's cheap.  I'll explain to my kid later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who was,  who was there? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Who was holding the flag?  Yeah.  Give me that one picture of you with your head under the dress.  Like you're taking a picture in 1910.  Riley likes that one too.  It's an open house.  My kid,  my kid pissed on Matt's foot in the photo.  He's used to that.  Ah,  fucking Christ.  I'm just throwing out stinkers.  No,  that wasn't bad.  But that was a fucking,  that was a Jake LaMotta comeback.  You're used to that.  No,  no.  I didn't mean because of Bobby. 
[02:00:00]  I meant because his wife's going to,  I got it.  I got it.  Oh,  okay.  We all got it.  All right.  This wasn't fun.  No,  when I said,  no,  you're used to that was actually what LaMotta said in Raging Bull.  Oh,  we did.  He blamed us for being stupid.  Yeah.  Not his jokes stinking.  I didn't.  I played myself.  I said,  I've been throwing out stinkers all day.  That's what I said.  Oh,  Joe.  Wow.  Have a little confidence in yourself.  Bailey J looks,  I mean,  honest to God though,  unbelievable. 
[02:00:30]  Oh,  she looks,  I mean,  I mean,  we were,  me and my wife,  my Don came up too.  We were hanging out with,  they have a beautiful home in a cul-de-sac next to a pagan witch and some other.  Oh,  really?  Yeah.  You can't just move into a regular family.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  You gotta go.  So,  uh,  yeah,  Bailey posted a few pictures,  uh,  recently.  And it was like,  whoa,  okay.  Oh,  it gets,  it's so confusing.  It's like,  I'm no longer confused about it. 
[02:01:00]  Oh,  you're not.  I will suck her dick and lick her asshole.  Joe,  Joe,  Joe.  What?  What do you mean what?  Travis,  I'm sorry.  It's fine.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  He apologized to him for it.  He did the same thing.  Oh,  it's fine.  Between Travis,  not so much Travis,  but with Lisa in the house,  house,  host,  what the fuck was I just doing?  I don't know,  but you see how easy.  It's not a Canadian.  Lisa in the house.  It went from home to house and it connected.  It's Canadian.  Yeah,  usually that's Jimmy is simulating, 
[02:01:30]  you know?  No one knows what that word means,  but what are you going to do?  You're simulating.  Say it in an English accent.  I woke up today.  Going to the gym?  Yeah.  Going to the gym?  Eating?  I lost a little weight.  I got injured sleeping.  I hurt my hand in the goddamn pillow.  Sometimes you hurt yourself.  I was biting the pillow.  I've got fingerprints in my hips like they're dull.  I love that me scratching my cornea 
[02:02:00]  turned into me getting banged in the ass  by some dude in Montreal.  You wouldn't fess up  to exactly how it happened,  so we must speculate  that you were getting dicked in the ass.  So, Joe,  back to what you just said  and how important it really is.  You would suck Bailey J's dick.  Well,  remember about a year ago,  I was on the fence  about whether I'd suck a dick or not.  I am far past.  I am off of that fence.  Wow.  That fence post  is firmly planted in my ass.  He bent over the fence post.  You didn't need to be on the fence. 
[02:02:30]  I unlocked the gate  and walked through it for you.  Joe,  what changed?  I just think she's so fucking hot  that the idea of putting her dick  in my mouth  turns me on.  Wow.  Joe,  you're gay.  You're just gay.  Well,  hold on now,  Bob.  And that's amazing.  Canada really changes people.  It all seems okay up here.  Everybody's so nice.  Very liberal.  Very liberal thinking people.  Just for laughs.  Tom watched Liberace 
[02:03:00]  get his balls tickled  in the bathtub for a month  and he's creeped out by Joe.  That was wordy.  I didn't think he was going to make it.  He was flat.  He pulled it out.  He did.  Joe,  you don't think that's gay, Joe?  No,  not at all  because I don't want to blow  any of the fine looking gentlemen  in this room.  Wait a minute.  Slow down.  No,  no,  I'm not insulting them.  I'm kidding.  I can't tell anymore.  I don't know why.  Maybe you were going to  throw your coffee on me last week  because I thought you were being serious  and you're like,  I'll throw my fucking coffee. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah,  throw it on your back  so you're used to it.  Yeah,  like fucking cum.  Yeah,  Jesus.  Hold the coffee just to cream.  So,  wow,  so you're thinking of it this way.  It's just a woman  with a penis.  Yes.  That's right.  It's just an extension  of her.  Yes.  It's a long,  hard vagina.  Yes.  You know what Joe's going to really realize  he fucked up  is when just that  blow 
[02:04:00]  hits his mouth  and he's going to go like this.  I fucked up.  I need a barrel.  I need a barrel.  Yes.  It's going to be like  when you get a bad bite  of a tuna fish sandwich  and you just go,  oh,  oh,  oh,  oh.  I fucked up.  He's going to run home in the woods.  It doesn't taste like a girl.  It doesn't taste like a girl.  What was I thinking?  I'll tell you  when you realize 
[02:04:30]  you fucked up.  It's when  the aftertaste  hits you.  Oh,  God.  Of the sperm  or the penis?  Oh.  The sperm.  I was just wondering  if there's an aftertaste  to a penis, too.  No.  I know.  Jimmy,  I was,  I know.  Oh,  boy.  I wonder what that's like.  What is the aftertaste?  Bleach.  Seriously?  Yeah,  my ex-girlfriend,  I used to come in her mouth  and she'd come blow it in my face  and go,  did my breast smell?  I come,  hey,  did your ex-girlfriend have a cock? 
[02:05:00]  Stop.  Stop acting like  you had to come inside  somebody else's mouth  and they spit it back  in your mouth.  No,  no.  It came directly  from the fountain.  No,  no.  Later on,  Jim cut out the middle man.  I'm not denying that,  but I'm just saying  that where I get the aftertaste  thought from  was from a girl  blowing the breath  in my face.  Travis' kid  was just marched  out of the room.  Yes,  yes.  Marilee,  grown out of the room.  This is the funny part,  the grandfather stayed. 
[02:05:30]  We're still all in.  I like where this is going.  You joined the show,  sir.  Grandpa,  you all right?  We had to get the kid  out of here,  though?  No,  no,  she had to go  to the con.  To the con.  That's it.  She actually turned to Lisa  and said,  Mommy,  I got to take a shit.  That's what she's learned  over the years.  Anthony,  you've never tasted  your own jizz?  No,  you know what?  Yeah,  I guess I've... 
[02:06:00]  Wow,  this is a fucking  solid answer.  No,  well,  yeah,  I have actually.  I was going to say no  because you just think  of like,  you come and then  fucking shove it in your mouth.  Not like that,  but I have...  You come in your mouth  because your dick is so big.  I have come in a girl  and I use a spoon.  I'm civilized.  I have come in a girl  and then,  and then like  kind of gone down on her.  Yeah,  who hasn't?  Later on in the evening.  Really?  You know,  not like shoving my tongue 
[02:06:30]  in there to...  What about...  Like a fucking...  When you get the edges  of an ice cream sandwich.  You know,  I was...  Yeah,  just the outside,  but it still tastes a little.  As soon as you said it,  that's the best answer.  I'm going to ask...  Well,  we know.  Opie.  Yeah,  I'm sure.  Really?  Yeah.  Why are you...  You got to give it a little...  Why are you getting nervous?  What?  Opie's all of a sudden  testifying in front of Congress. 
[02:07:00]  He turns to his lawyer,  should I answer this?  Covers the mic a little.  Yeah?  Yeah,  sure.  Give it a little taste.  Sure.  A little taste.  A little taste.  Why not?  Anything to spice up  that oatmeal in the morning.  Bobby has to turn  the whole show gay  when he comes on.  Bobby?  He's not gay.  I'm just asking  if you ate the,  you know...  I'm just asking if you  ate cum after we talked  to Joe about sucking  a man's dick.  Nothing gay there.  She is not a man. 
[02:07:30]  Absolutely.  Good point, Joseph.  All right.  You have a white knight  over here defending her.  That's right.  That's right.  She's my baby.  I know.  You fucking talk  about her with respect.  I know.  Here's how you know  Joe's gay.  Joe, if she didn't have  the penis,  would you still like her?  Nope.  That's not gay, Bobby.  Joe accepts her  as she is.  That is something.  If she was just a girl,  exactly the same  as she is now,  except she was really hot.  Of course I would still like her.  She was retardedly hot. 
[02:08:00]  But would you be  obsessing about her like this?  No, there is something  unique about her.  Cock balls.  Very unique to a girl.  Well, that's what I...  I'm infatuated with her  because it's not my thing.  It's never really been my thing.  You're really selling that angle.  It's just that, you know,  I can't explain it.  There is something  more intriguing about her,  the fact that she is  transsexual.  But of course,  if she was just a regular girl, 
[02:08:30]  of course,  I'd want to...  Yeah, absolutely.  Or just a girl.  Right.  What do you mean?  No, seriously,  I don't understand.  What do you mean?  It was bad.  I'm going to be a real man  and blow her husband, Matt.  I'm a fucking man.  That's a real man.  Get a man off, dude.  But not gay.  I don't need those tits.  Fuck it.  Where's the guy?  The obsession is  because she has a dick. 
[02:09:00]  Joe.  It's a very intriguing thing  to me.  Joe says intriguing.  One more time,  I'm going to hit him  with this one.  Joe, you know,  I had a friend  who accidentally hooked up  with a transvestite  at Patty McGee's  on Long Island  like five summers ago.  Yeah, a friend.  And then he fucking  fell in love  with this transvestite  and he wasn't gay.  Whoa.  That's God.  That's God.  Wow.  And he's dead now.  Oh, Jimmy,  that's my God.  That guy  leaned up against the lights. 
[02:09:30]  And he started  hooking up  with this transvestite.  He hooked up  with this transvestite.  Hold on, Chris,  Chris, were there breasts  or no?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  No, the guy,  he thought it was a girl.  We all thought it was a girl.  His breasts  are transsexual.  Transsexual, I apologize.  Big difference, trust me.  In price, I mean.  And it was pretty, uh...  Yeah, sorry.  And he felt,  he was like in love with her.  It was just like his girlfriend.  And then he broke up with her  and then he's,  now he's like,  has like a wife.  Like a regular woman wife.  Does she know? 
[02:10:00]  What?  Does she know?  Yeah, it's like out in the open.  She knows that he did that.  Yeah, everybody knows.  He just,  it was just accepted  like he's,  I guess,  you know what I mean?  The girl had a dick.  It wasn't like chopped off,  made a vagina.  It was a penis.  Oh, yes.  See that?  Chopped off.  Yeah, well,  I think it went through the change.  Oh, okay.  So it was,  yeah.  Post-stop.  That's true, yeah.  Post-stop.  So he had a little change purse?  We always wanted him,  he wouldn't,  because he was like in love with her  so he wouldn't send us pictures.  No, but the trans,  did he have a little, 
[02:10:30]  like a little pocket?  I don't know.  No, he still had the cock,  he's saying.  Yeah.  He had the cock.  He went to Thailand.  No, he said he didn't have the cock.  Oh, I'm so confused.  Let me explain something.  This is what your friend told you.  She was pre-op.  She was not post-op,  because if she was post-op,  he would have shown you,  hey, look at pussy.  Yeah.  There was still a cop.  Oh, I love her too much  to show you that.  Yes.  Beautiful pussy.  I would never dishonor her.  Yeah, you keep your quarters  for the laundromat  and her fucking snatch. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, and Bobby,  you know what too,  this guy, true,  he scratched his cornea,  got infected,  and he does have a fake eye,  so you should make sure  that you get antibiotics.  How do you go to that?  I love you, man.  I was kidding about your head.  I love you.  No, I'm just,  you know me,  I care about your,  you know,  the health and all that.  But I also know you're nuts.  You take one thing  and you just worry about it.  Yeah.  But he's just telling you  to be careful,  or all you're going to be doing  is fucking playing Peter Pan  and doing Wheat Thins commercials.  Sandy Duncan, 
[02:11:30]  you dumb cocksuckers.  Wow.  Yeah, people should remember  old commercials  from 30 years ago.  Who the fuck's going to get  a Sandy Duncan reference?  Apparently no one.  Yeah, I don't see that  as being our fault.  It was a Higgins  from Magnum P.I.  I'm just kidding.  Tag me your lacy,  you bags of shit.  Have you seen how good  the post-op vaginas look?  Holy shit, Joe.  You are all in. 
[02:12:00]  Just because I follow  a couple transsexuals  on Twitter  and I look at their pictures  constantly.  I've seen a couple of pictures  of those things.  They, you know,  I guess as more time goes on,  they get better at doing that.  I can't believe it's not butter.  They take the penis.  They take the penis.  They pretty much  just hollow it out.  And then they flip it  inside out.  Yeah, like a dishwasher glove.  Right.  Like a dishwasher glove.  But what's the real test  is like, 
[02:12:30]  do they smell like balls  still?  Oh, God.  It would have to, right?  It would have to.  It's not going to smell  like a woman.  I have fucked a post-op  and I suspect it was a post-op  because it was like  the features that look  like duck lit.  Like, I just had a really  weird instinct  and I went to see a woman  and as we're fucky,  I could feel that  it wasn't normal.  It felt like different  or something foreign about it  because I don't think  it was as wet  as it should have been.  And I just,  I never asked  but I left  and I went,  that was a fucking  post-op transsexual  because I could just sense  my instincts told me  there was something not.  I heard that it actually 
[02:13:00]  can get wet though.  Oh, maybe.  What the fuck is that?  I found a picture  of a post-op.  Bobby,  you want to see this one?  I got some great ones.  Bobby.  Well, yeah,  let me see.  First of all,  Obi's trying to make me puke  but it's too far away.  It looks like a salad.  It looks like a salad.  That should make you puke.  Bobby's missing.  I love Canadian crowds.  They're actually nice.  They're like your savage  mean fans back in the States. 
[02:13:30]  It's true.  They actually went,  aww.  I fucking love them all.  I had a buddy that did that.  They got a,  they didn't even realize  it was transsexual at first  and the vagina  was just like unusable.  Your asshole does a lot  of the work.  You get that thick pussy.  It's a two,  it's a two whole operation.  Yes.  Your asshole does  all the heavy lifting.  You get her asshole  look like the hole  in the wall  they pulled Carol Ann  out of and pulled it right.  What's so funny too  about like Arab chicks,  like I'm half Arab, 
[02:14:00]  they won't fuck  in the vagina  because that means  they lost their virginity  but they'll let you  take them in the asshole.  Oh, that's good.  So that's like really romantic  on your wedding night.  It's like,  honey, I can't get my dick  into your airtight vagina.  Can I just take a shot  at your gaping asshole?  That's Joe DeRosa,  by the way,  for all the Arabs  listening up here.  Joe DeRosa.  I'm half Arab.  Yeah, that's not  good enough.  It's twice as bad.  I think that's worse.  I think that's actually worse.  You've been trained  out of the extra.  Yeah, you should know better.  Allah, what, what, what, 
[02:14:30]  Allah, what, what,  lock your fucking head off.  You don't think  they stopped listening  at the dick sucking part  earlier?  You think they're still tuned in?  Yeah, that's where  they tuned in.  I'm still hanging in there.  You have post-ops  on your phone?  I have.  There's a transsexual girl  I follow called  Kelly Pierce.  Kelly, why?  Who's very,  she's good looking.  She's not Bailey,  but she looks great.  Where's she from?  I don't know.  She's a porn star.  She, I mean,  she's a,  let me see here. 
[02:15:00]  Her website is.  Oh boy,  he's got all the info.  This is weird.  I love how it started out  like it was kind of like  a kind of an,  yeah,  like a one,  one off quirky thing.  Bailey J is like,  no,  I got pictures.  And now he's screaming.  She doesn't post as much content  as she's supposed to.  On her Twitter feed though,  she had pictures  of post-op vagina  and I like,  I could,  I thought they were just  pictures of vaginas.  They were so perfect  and gorgeous.  Oh wow.  And then she,  and then under him,  it was like great post-op work done. 
[02:15:30]  And I was like,  I couldn't believe.  What's her website?  That it wasn't the real thing.  It's like a blog spot thing,  but it's blogtalkradio.com  slash midnight.  Forget it.  It's like,  it's so long.  It doesn't even fit,  but her pictures,  I can't find her pictures.  Then they make labia  out of the bulls.  Yeah.  They cut them out of there.  Out of your bull bag.  Out of your yam bag.  They fucking,  and you're fashion  some kind of a twat. 
[02:16:00]  Dr. Dice,  pay his scalpel, please.  I need to make a gash  out of this cock.  Oh!  Then Dr. Steve jumps in.  Wah, wah, wah.  There's extra parts though, right?  Like what do you do  with the leftover?  Can we please just have  Dr. Dice keep explaining?  Please.  Please.  It's all right.  I'm asking Dr. Dice.  You gotta take  the piece of the head.  You know,  the sensitive part  that makes you go  guz, guz.  And then they fashion 
[02:16:30]  the clitoralist  or whatever they call it.  So, you know,  cause the chick  still gotta get off.  Cause even though  she got a cock,  now she's a hoo-er.  The funniest Vine videos  I've ever done  were at your house.  And it's just me  and I go,  here's Dice.  Here's Dice pouring  a shot of Jäger, my sir.  Then it cuts to Anthony  pouring Jäger  and he's going,  get in there,  guz, guz, guz.  And then the second one  is me going, 
[02:17:00]  here's Dice explaining  the religious poem  Footprints.  And it cuts to Anthony  and he goes,  the hottest part  of my life,  you abandoned me,  you cocksucker.  Jesus,  only one set  of footprints,  you prick.  And then he said,  I carried you.  Get the fuck out of here.  Fucking nice.  Alright, back to trannies.  Ah, right. 
[02:17:30]  Actually, breaking news,  the cock pictures  have come out.  The new Anthony Weiner  cock pictures.  Oh, goody.  Let's see.  Breaking news.  You mean,  Carlos Danger.  Carlos Danger.  Yes.  If you go to  thedirty.com,  they're saying  this is the first time  they've ever posted  dirty pictures.  Is that a local story  or did you hear about  that up here in Canada?  Anthony Weiner.  You guys know?  Yeah, Carlos Danger.  Dick pics.  Was it after he got busted?  Yes.  This is two days ago.  What an idiot.  It was a year later. 
[02:18:00]  And now the cock pictures  came out today.  It's just breaking right now.  After he resigned,  he kept doing it.  He kept doing it.  For a year.  For a year.  And just the most  fucking perverted shit.  It's great.  You got it?  That's his...  He's got a big fat one.  Does he?  Not really.  No, I was not that...  Yeah, I knew he was  doing trick fucking angles  with that other picture.  Oh, that one.  Pretty nice.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  That's fucking...  That's a new one.  That's...  He's got a lot of nerve  calling that Carlos Danger.  That's Facebook magic. 
[02:18:30]  It should be Frank Caution.  Holy fuck.  That's like where the girl  fucking holds the camera  way up here.  Yeah.  As you get that  slimming look.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of angles  to make your cock  look fucking phenomenal.  And then you got to  plump it up to the point  where it doesn't look  like you got a hard on.  Yeah.  But, you know,  the second it starts twitching,  put the camera down.  And what did he do?  You got to wait.  Give it 10 minutes.  So he...  Was he on, like, 
[02:19:00]  public sites with it  or was he dealing  with, like, friends of his  who were just texting?  He went by the name  Carlos Danger's real  and went on these  fucking sites.  What an idiot.  What an idiot.  So he got caught  and he's like,  all I got to do  to get away with this time  is change my name  to Carlos Danger.  Right?  Right.  He got away.  And you know what?  People were willing  to forgive him.  He was running for mayor.  He was doing well.  He was doing well.  People put it...  Because he got up there.  He said,  look, I did this.  I'm sorry.  I apologize to my wife.  All this happy horse shit.  And then these come out  and he goes,  as I told you, 
[02:19:30]  and he said,  I told you when this  first happened,  there were other photos  and texts out there.  And they're like,  yeah,  but when did this come out?  Like last week.  I fucking did it.  Oh, that's what...  I thought this was just  stuff you didn't get caught for.  No.  No.  After he got caught,  he kept doing it.  That guy's awesome.  Kept doing it.  And then his wife  is just standing there like...  Teehee.  I stand behind him.  We're working things out.  God.  You fucking owe me.  He's toast.  He must have an actual addiction.  Like I thought that was bullshit,  but he's fucking crazy. 
[02:20:00]  We were reading the text  he was sending this  22-year-old girl or something.  And as you're reading it,  you're going,  no one stops doing this.  Like the way he would write shit,  it's not just like,  well,  I'd like to get a little frisky with you.  It's like,  I want to fucking come in your mouth  and hold your hair and pull it.  You don't go from that  to like,  all right,  I'm done.  You don't stop doing that. 
[02:20:30]  It's,  you know.  It's hardcore.  It's not like a guy  that occasionally smokes a dube  as opposed to a guy  that's a dube  booting up fucking heroin  on a daily basis.  Yes,  I said a dube.  A dube.  A dube.  Well,  you know what it is too?  It's these,  politicians have such a fucking easy ride.  It's such a beautiful,  easy ride.  It's like being a comic  or something like that,  you know?  And God forbid he walks,  if he would just walk away  from politics,  it's like,  dude,  take your cock out  in the middle of the street.  Nobody will give a shit. 
[02:21:00]  You know what I mean?  But he won't walk away from it.  No one cares about what he's doing.  Like,  it's a guy texting  some fucking 22-year-old girl  pictures of his dick  and sexting.  More power to you.  It's great.  Right.  But then the second you become  a politician,  that shit's kind of off the table.  Right.  You really kind of got to,  you know.  Yeah,  when you're making laws  about other stuff.  it shows poor judgment.  A lot of times  you can actually do stuff like that  while you're on a live radio show.  I mean,  you'd be amazed  that sometimes  you can get a picture  texted to you  30 seconds ago. 
[02:21:30]  What is that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, geez.  That's a nice open asshole.  Hello.  That is a gamping asshole.  I told you not to show anybody.  You're an asshole, Jimmy.  Pick up Sam.  I've been speaking of open assholes.  Sammy.  Look at that little fraggle.  Yeah,  those salmon pants.  Nice salmon colored.  Sam is looking good these days.  Any after show today?  Not today,  but tomorrow,  there will be a pre-show. 
[02:22:00]  Whoa.  Here comes the pre.  That's right.  Yeah?  Yeah,  probably like six.  Oh, man.  You guys want to come?  You enjoy that.  I'll be snoozing.  Yeah.  What's up, Sam?  How are you doing, Bobby?  Why did you have to ruin  your body with that tattoo?  You know what, Joe?  We should have had a couple  of maybe Bloody Marys  for the show.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been fun.  Get us a little fucking,  maybe tomorrow,  we'll have to get  some Bloody Marys.  I don't get that.  You're going to drink  early in the morning? 
[02:22:30]  But it's Bloody Marys.  What the fuck does that mean?  I don't know.  They've invented a drink  that it's okay  to drink in the morning.  Yeah.  Some drunk was like,  I got a drink before noon,  but fuck, this is crazy.  I can't have scotch.  Yeah.  I look like a maniac  with this pint of Guinness.  Yeah.  They just dumped some champagne  in that orange juice.  Problem solved.  If you do,  if you got a fucking thing  of Guinness or something  and it's eight in the morning,  people would be like,  oh, that poor guy.  Oh, Jesus.  He's got a problem.  You have a fucking mimosa  or a Bloody Marys.  It's like, 
[02:23:00]  that looks good.  I'll have one.  Yeah, it's got celery  and I'll...  Yes, it's a breakfast drink.  I see two grown men  with Bloody Marys.  You look like my aunt.  Nothing.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, Bobby.  Oh, Bob.  There's his exercise for the day.  I scratched my retina.  Will you stop at the flashes?  Freaking stupid, 
[02:23:30]  overachieving journalist.  Dude.  Why don't you take a picture  of some of the celebrities  in the room?  We've got Peter Dinklage  sitting there in the second row.  Right next to you.  You got...  Sir, you got Barry Katz  sitting right next to you.  I love Barry Katz.  Or Triple H.  Take your fucking pick.  The two guys  from any episode of M.A.S.H.  Yeah.  Because...  Cut!  Because they're Korean. 
[02:24:00]  Are you guys...  Are you guys...  Are you guys Korean?  No.  Oh, we're Chinese.  You're Chinese?  I got dim sum the other day.  Good idea.  What?  What?  That's not Chinese.  Dim sum is Chinese.  Dim sum is Chinese.  What is dim sum?  Dim sum, you go in for breakfast,  they have...  Why don't you guys explain?  I don't want to take that.  How do you know they even know?  Look at them.  Look at them. 
[02:24:30]  That doesn't matter.  Of course they know.  You don't think these two fucking...  His last name could possibly be dim sum.  These two MMA fighters  don't know what dim sum is?  Do you know what dim sum is?  Yeah, it's...  They wield dumplings in a cart.  Pretty much that sums it up.  For breakfast, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Brunch.  Or whatever you...  What's in the dumpling?  What's in the...  All kinds of stuff.  Shrimp.  Shrimp.  Veggies.  Yeah, there's like carts that fly around.  Carts that fly around.  And you dip it in some good shit.  Yeah, yeah.  That does sound good.  It's breakfast.  It's the same thing as dinner dim sum. 
[02:25:00]  It's the same thing.  I know.  But it's for breakfast.  You know, pork and vegetables.  I'm making fun of you with alcohol for breakfast.  Yeah, you're going to have dumplings.  I'm going for dinner, lunch for breakfast.  You're having pork for breakfast.  It's good, though, right?  It's delicious.  Yeah.  I like how you thank them like they invented it.  Right?  Yes.  I got to piss.  You got to piss?  Yeah, yeah.  We could take a break.  Yeah, we could.  We need to because we have another hour.  We could top of the hour.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  Take a break.  Is everybody staying around, right?  Sure.  Come on. 
[02:25:30]  Let's hear it for these guys.  We'll be back live.  Montreal, Canada with the Opie and Anthony show.  Live from the world's largest comedy festival, Just for Laughs Montreal, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  More.  Next.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Live from Just for Laughs Montreal.  Yeah.  Live from Montreal.  Loving this show today, man. 
[02:26:00]  Doing the show with all our friends from New York, basically.  Yes, we are.  Opie, I've been told, though, that the lovely and talented Tom Papa must leave us.  What?  I do have to leave.  I have to go talk to a Canadian guy about something.  Canadian about a horse.  There's like a whole Canadian Opie and Anthony show going on upstairs.  Oh, wow.  It's really weird.  Oh, it's another radio show?  No, it's just some interview.  But I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye and give up my seat for the great John Mulaney. 
[02:26:30]  Yes, John Mulaney.  Wow.  First time on our show.  What's up, John?  Yeah.  We're just waiting for Tom to leave.  Yeah, no, Tom.  All right, Tom.  I'm really milking the exit.  Yeah, well, I don't get why you think this is some passing of the torch.  Get up and get the fuck out, Tom.  I just don't want to do what I have to do after I leave the show.  This is a lot of fun.  Thanks for the donuts, Jimmy.  Can somebody get the creepy photographer out from behind you, guys?  Yeah, exactly.  What are you doing, you weird elbow?  I know.  He's trying to get the scratch cornea. 
[02:27:00]  I know.  Just give him the scratch cornea and he'll leave.  What's Bobby doing?  I don't know.  Oh, jeez.  What is he doing?  He's going back.  There he is.  He slipped past you, Bob.  Wow.  I think Bobby was going to punch him in the face.  Where did he go?  He's lurking in the fucking grassy knoll back there.  Hey, LA Confidential.  Fucking get out from behind there.  There he is.  He's snapping pictures all over.  Now he's moving around the back again.  He's trying to get your cornea.  I'm telling you.  Just give him the picture. 
[02:27:30]  Give him the cornea shot.  It's the exclusive for TMZ.  It's the exclusive, right.  Thanks, fellas.  I'll see you later.  All right.  Tom Papa, everyone.  We'll see you later.  All right.  The lovely Tom Papa.  Yeah.  Very funny guy.  All right.  And, of course, John Mulaney will now.  First time on our show, Jim Norton.  Yes.  Take a seat, sir.  Hi, John.  Thank you.  Hi, guys.  There he is.  Jimmy likes you.  Lovely.  He said, we got to have you on the show, man.  Oh, thank you, Jim.  Not that we don't.  No, yeah.  No, we all like you.  That is kind of.  Hey, Jim.  I know.  That sounded bad.  I'm sorry.  He said, we should have you on.  It's like your first day on the job. 
[02:28:00]  Like, someone must like you here, because I don't know what you're doing here.  Thank you, Jim.  I ain't vouching for you.  There it is.  It just is Mike.  Yeah, it's great.  It was in Tom Papa's setting.  And then he had to go.  As we all know from that drama, Tom Papa had to leave.  But now I'm here for him.  Tom wanted that moment, like, when fucking, I don't know, like, Bob Hope would show up  on the Carson show, and then he'd be like, hey, I gotta go.  I gotta.  And, like, he's still here.  He's still here.  As I'm back.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:28:30]  How's it going?  Tom.  Oh, I hope you got bumped on the other radio show.  Great.  All right.  I'll see you later, Tom.  All right.  There he goes.  I think he's finally leaving.  I'm not on his podcast later.  Tom is very, his body is in shape, but he has the head of a fat person.  Doesn't he?  Wow.  He looks like he.  That's exactly what he was talking about.  That's why Tom didn't want to leave.  Yeah.  Once you leave, it's like, all right, don't talk about me. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  We're full of fucking comics.  They won't talk about you when you leave.  Tom just wanted that moment, like, where everybody's like, oh, fuck, Tom's going.  All right.  And nobody gave a shit.  People are like, all right.  Because fucking Mulaney sat down.  The new funny motherfucker.  The new face.  This guy is, I tell you what.  The new fat head, yeah.  A little thin.  He is one of the funniest.  There's a few guys I don't want to follow.  Oh.  This cocksucker.  Whoa.  Is so funny.  He killed at the cellar one night.  The place was rumbling. 
[02:29:30]  I thought he brought somebody on stage and said, hit the fucking music.  He fucking annihilates John Mulaney.  One of the funniest guys out there right now.  Is this what this show is like?  This is great.  I was always nervous.  He just compliments the whole time.  Oh, total queer.  But he.  Bobby Brace, we can't hang at the table.  But, you know, good comedy.  It's all just comedy.  Where are you from?  I'm from Chicago.  Chicago.  Yeah.  We were there last summer.  We had a good time.  That place is kind of getting a little violent these days. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, it's getting violent.  If you want to go to Chicago but don't like the violence, just go to Toronto.  Is that it?  Like the same thing without sans violence?  With sans violence.  One Canadian dude left.  Did you get that?  He's from Toronto.  Okay.  Yeah, he's the Toronto guy.  From T-Dot.  Toronto is what we use for every American city when we can't afford to film in our own country.  So thank you.  You've homed Batman and many other people.  You might know my cousin.  I have a cousin in Toronto, Paul Bernardo.  Oh. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  Love when people do that.  Paul Bernardo.  Yeah.  You know who that is?  Yeah, he was a bad boy.  I don't.  Oh, he was the serial killer who was originally the Scarborough rapist.  It's a funny story.  Dude, your package is so tight.  Can you close your legs?  Jesus.  Yeah, you really are sitting with your fucking legs at like 90 degree angles.  I like it.  The guy that won't marry his chick?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not going to marry a chick?  No.  He's not going to close his legs either.  We learned that earlier. 
[02:31:00]  He's definitely not.  Why would you?  Look at him.  He's a good looking guy.  What about her?  She's gorgeous.  All right.  What?  I didn't say.  I said nothing about you.  She's got that same sweet piece between her legs, right?  Yeah.  That American Eagle cock he's got fucking flesh in that.  Joe will go over and taste it for us.  Why don't we talk to the lovely couple behind you sitting next to Mohamed Atta? 
[02:31:30]  Why?  Can I just ask a question?  Why is this like Noah's Ark?  Why is there pairs of everybody?  If you're happy, you need another Arab to come.  That's good.  Where are you guys from?  Nova Scotia.  Nova Scotia.  Are you a couple?  Yes.  Oh, married?  Yes.  Oh, how long?  Five years.  She does all the talking, doesn't she, dude?  You gave up talking, thinking, everything five years ago. 
[02:32:00]  That's pretty good.  How's it going, the marriage thing?  You still digging it?  It's good.  Great, right?  Right, honey?  It's great?  Oh, that beaten look in your eyes.  Holy shit.  Do you have children?  No.  Oh, okay.  That's kind of good.  Believe me, that's the last key on the key chain for that lock, is the fact that you  don't have kids.  You can always take that with you, like, once I dump this bitch, I don't have to ever  see her.  Jesus Christ, Anthony. 
[02:32:30]  That was me.  What's with you?  I'm just saying, me.  That's how I felt.  I can't wait till you're 60 and just alone in a pool.  What do you mean, can't wait?  Exactly.  Ask the listeners.  They'll tell you I'm 70.  Hey, fuckers.  Oh, my God.  No, I'd rather be alone.  I got, like, my brother has a lovely daughter.  My sister has a wonderful son.  I got, you know, niece and nephew and stuff. 
[02:33:00]  The lovely Travis has the lovely little Riley that comes over the pool.  So there's kids over the house.  But then I don't have to fucking support them.  I don't have to deal with their fucking mothers.  That's for sure.  Like, like, the idea.  One of them is your sister.  Fuck her.  No, I don't.  I didn't mean it that way.  I meant, like, if I had a wife and a kid, I would have to deal with the mother of the  kid.  Dude.  So, yeah.  When you said, I'm sorry, you said there's kids over the house. 
[02:33:30]  Opie and me had a silent just crack on you.  We just pointed at each other.  Like, yeah.  Of course.  Enough said.  Right.  They're always within age.  Yeah.  I check all the statutes.  A bunch of girls dancing to Justin Bieber in the pool.  Yeah.  Their little legs kick back and forth.  All right, Uncle Paul.  Jesus.  Oh, my fucking Paul.  I want to find out what this fucking hipster couple is about right here.  The next generation right here. 
[02:34:00]  Look at these.  The Vice Magazine here.  Yeah.  Vice Magazine.  They're not a couple.  No, they're not a couple.  Yeah, we went through that.  She's running solo.  Yeah, she's married.  Solo?  Yeah, she's dating a guy who couldn't get tickets.  An artist.  Yeah, he makes no money at all.  He's a fucking loser is what he is.  You know, she came with Zach Kalif a fucking Nackus?  I love that you just.  Zach Kalif.  Kalik.  Kalik.  Kalik.  Kalik.  Did you work Kalik into Galifanakis?  I fucked it up intentionally.  No, I'm saying. 
[02:34:30]  Was that like a play on words?  Because he's got to get a little bit of a Kalik thing going on.  Wow, Joe.  No, I didn't read into it that much.  Wow, Joe.  You fucking nut.  I thought you did like a little pun thing.  Yeah, Zach Kalik for Nackus.  I thought you did a little pun thing.  No, but him and Troy should fuck each other.  Troy, you guys fucking should hang out.  Seems like a cool dude.  He does.  That wasn't a bad thing.  Here's the humiliating thing.  That girl.  What's your name again? 
[02:35:00]  I don't remember your name.  Dana.  Dana's very beautiful.  She's friends with the guy with the hat next to her.  She doesn't know this guy.  But this guy's her friend.  And then you'll look at her and go, well, this guy's really good looking.  So her friend probably feels really bad about that.  Well, because he fucking wore a dumb hat back with just the little hair sticking out like wings.  The other guy next to him, you guys look like a couple.  Maybe you should hook it up.  Do you have a girlfriend?  Fucking face.  Yeah.  Fucking new faces.  We met you on Monday with my wife. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Bob.  Yeah.  See that.  Really knowing the fans there, Bob.  You rubbed my belly and said I was a beautiful boy.  You are.  Oh.  Really?  You're just going to whip that out on a fucking national radio?  You should remember.  You ever hear the word shh?  That's cool.  So you guys are...  I didn't know you two were friends, though.  Right?  I and I?  What couldn't...  You couldn't close the deal, huh?  No, she was already taken by the time... 
[02:36:00]  And that matters how?  In what way?  All's fair in love and fucking your friends over.  Are you Elliot's friend or are you just her friend?  I know Elliot, but...  You don't like Elliot.  You met him once.  I met him once, yeah.  So you don't care about his feelings?  Does Elliot hate him because he knows that he's secretly in love with you and he's the guy...  I'm the one that got her to the show.  I put her on the plus one.  Hey.  Oh.  Don't tell us.  Tell her.  Tell her.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Tell those tits. 
[02:36:30]  Those aren't...  You got a padded bra on, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus, Bob.  Why are you...  Jesus, why are you going to ruin everything?  Because I know.  What do you have on a padded shirt?  Bobby.  Bobby.  No, you guys were nice when I came in.  Now you're turning into the...  I don't know what that got an applause break.  Oh, fuck.  This is a good line.  She's beautiful.  Hey, Bob Kelly.  You're late.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hey, retarded Dave Attell. 
[02:37:00]  Hi, sir.  Hey, what's up?  Not much, man.  How you doing?  Are you a fan or do you work for this place?  SiriusXM.  I'm on Canada Last, a Canadian SiriusXM.  Oh, you're an employer.  Oh, yeah.  What, you do a show?  Yeah, I do a show, man.  What kind of show?  Comic Strip.  It's a talk show, comics.  I did it.  It's good.  We're doing a show?  Yeah, I think Bobby's doing it later, I think.  I'm doing it later, I mean.  Oh, cool.  I wasn't invited to do it, but...  Yeah, you were.  You said no. 
[02:37:30]  No, I wasn't.  Yeah, you did.  Oh.  Did you invite Jimmy?  Hey, Jimmy, you want to come do my show, man?  No.  Bobby's way nicer.  Oh, man.  Trying to divide and conquer everybody.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I can't stop looking at the two fucking Chinese dudes.  Can we put the Arabs and the Chinese dudes together?  What?  And then have Troy and this fucking mush sit together?  Just pair everybody up?  Yeah, just pair them all up.  And then what?  People come.  I don't know, just look at them. 
[02:38:00]  Like a zoo.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit, this show's over.  What?  No.  It's a transitional phase.  Yeah, we'll go back to the interview portion.  We'll chat with John.  We were professionals.  You guys are fucking pros.  We're just trying to bounce around.  What are we going to do?  John, let me ask you a question.  What's up?  You work for SNL?  I used to, yeah.  Oh, you quit?  Well, last year, yeah.  Yes, I do.  No one ever leaves, so yes.  What do you mean by that?  I don't understand.  Everyone comes back.  Really? 
[02:38:30]  Watch the show.  Everyone comes back.  You've never been in a skit, have you?  No, I did stuff on Update.  Like, I weaseled my way onto Update to do, like,  like desk pieces, you know?  But you were one of the head writers, right?  I was a writer for four years.  I never had a head writer.  Oh, really?  Was it as bad?  I mean, people talk.  I'm not, I know you can't trash it because you're still there,  kind of, but was it as crazy as people say?  It was as crazy, but it wasn't as bad,  because when I got the job in, like, 2008,  I had read all those books about SNL.  How bad it was, right?  Oh, this is going to be, like, Jay Moore's book, 
[02:39:00]  and, you know, the Live in New York.  I was like, this is going to be, like, cold, shitty, unfriendly,  but it's worth it to do for a year.  And then it was great when I got there.  Like, Seth Meyers and those guys really made an atmosphere  where it's a lot nicer.  I think from, you hear from people, it used to be that.  It used to be, like, a lot more cutthroat.  And I think just people have gotten over that.  But as a writer, you don't have to worry about getting, like,  the skit that you want to be on camera for.  Like, the guys that are actually on camera,  they submit ideas, and it's like, 
[02:39:30]  oh, they didn't take my fucking idea.  Being a writer, it's just kind of like, you know,  Yeah, they're vulnerable in a different way.  Yeah, so, like, it's going to be,  you're going to take it a lot more personally.  So there's no backstabbing going on with you.  Yeah, if you write a sketch about, like, the Grimace,  and it gets cut, that's fine.  But if you're fucking dressed as Grimace,  waiting backstage.  Right, right, and then they tell you.  And then they go, hey, that's off.  You're going to be a little pissed.  That's a lot more humiliating.  Guys, he's sitting right here.  Come on.  When Kurt hosted, we had a whole thing.  How do they pay over there? 
[02:40:00]  Pretty good?  Yeah, the long, yeah, yeah.  Make a good dime.  Get yourself a good apartment.  Yeah, I got, like, yeah,  I got, like, a studio apartment out of it.  That was good.  That was nice.  Did you live in a studio?  No, I moved after that even.  But I got out of the fucking Greenpoint hellhole I was in.  So that was good.  Are you married?  No, I'm getting married.  I just got engaged.  Whoa.  What the fuck are you thinking?  Look how nice these guys. 
[02:40:30]  If we're in U.S., they'd be like,  Boo.  Boo.  Look at that noise.  Prenup?  Uh, no.  Oh, God, you asshole.  No.  Prenup.  Anthony's had an unpleasant experience.  Jesus Christ.  You got a prenup.  How do you bring a prenup to a woman?  I'll tell her.  I'll tell her what happens.  It's terrible.  That is a good question.  How do you do it?  Because everyone says that, like, get a prenup.  But for real, how would you fucking bring that up? 
[02:41:00]  You just bring it to her while she's sleeping  and just scribble a name on a piece of paper.  So she doesn't need to be sleeping to forge a signature.  You could just do it when she's not in the room.  You like the fact that she's unconscious in front of you?  Yes.  That's better for sex.  That's what they're banking on, though.  The fact that you're getting into, at the beginning,  it's all the love and nicety,  and there's no way we're going to be together forever.  We're not breaking up ever, ever, ever.  And then you sign this, what amounts to a horrid contract,  where you could lose your shit. 
[02:41:30]  And then when it ends, it's just as bad as any other bad thing.  You're not thinking about the love.  You're like, I should have gotten a prenup.  Oh, dude.  All right, I'll call her.  Yeah, do that.  Let's call her now.  Hey, I got some good advice this morning.  Set up a PowerPoint presentation with celebrities that, you know,  here they are getting married, and now here they are.  Like, just fucking miserable.  But, like, she's not going to be swayed by examples of women getting a shitload of money  out of that guy.  You can't be like, hey, look what happened to Johnny Carson. 
[02:42:00]  He had to give away $150 million.  Yeah, and look at her better second husband.  Yeah.  Look at her total happy fucking second act in life.  Yeah, look how miserable she is with these millions and this new guy with a bigger dick.  Like, oh, don't do that.  I'm not dealing with a comedian anymore.  All right?  Not a good strategy.  Yeah, how do you bring that to a woman?  That's a fucking great question.  I would just leave it.  Before it gets to marriage, you talk about that, right?  You're like, I would get a prenup if I ever got married.  You've got to put the, yeah, plant the...  That's true. 
[02:42:30]  Early in a relationship, you can say a lot of things.  Like, I'll only have one kid, and if we have a second one, we're killing it.  And, like, you can say all those things early and then later be like,  now, as we discussed months ago.  Yeah, yeah, you can't then bring it up again.  Can't backtrack, man.  No, no.  Where's she going to go?  You're John Mulaney.  Where's she going to go?  That's pretty good.  Thank you.  I'm the Mulaney over here.  That's nice of you to say.  I bet she's very attractive.  She's beautiful.  She's a very nice.  She's a beautiful lady.  And, you know, she'll get sick of me, and it'll end badly, but that's okay.  So what? 
[02:43:00]  That's all right.  How long have you been with her?  Three and a half years.  See, John has come a long way in three and a half years career-wise, too.  So it's like you knew her before you started doing really well.  So it's like it's harder to bring that to her now.  Yeah, I've known her for a long time.  She was a, yeah.  Oh, which means, by the way, she was instrumental in your career.  Oh, you mean for, you're back to, you're back to the courtroom?  The lawyer's going to love the fact that you, your career got better once you got together.  Is that a real thing they use? 
[02:43:30]  It happened to him.  That, my wife, whose only occupation, as far as I know, was drinking Jack Daniels, was instrumental in me getting a gig on radio.  I married her when I was a construction worker.  I was installing heating and air conditioning duct work.  That's when I met her and married her.  I then got into radio, did pretty well for myself.  And apparently in court, I was told that she is most of the reason that I did well. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  Did she take the air conditioning money, too?  Did she take the millions you've earned?  The lucrative air conditioning fortune.  Oh, it was terrible.  I think you really helped her Jack Daniels career along also.  I think I did, too.  I gave her as much as a man could buy.  I told my wife, when she had a prenup, she'd be like, for what?  What am I going to get?  See, you never know.  They're like, oh, I'm signing a prenup for my fucking 20 bucks I'm able to spend a week. 
[02:44:30]  Is that what you were able to spend a week when you were banging nails?  Maybe, yeah.  Are you shitting me?  Well, I had to pay credit card bills because they gave me an $8,000 credit limit Visa card,  and I bought a jet ski on it.  No wonder.  No wonder why you're...  Oh, that bitch.  That's why you don't have any money.  Yeah, that bitch took all my money.  Anyway, I'm going to go buy a few jet skis.  Just fucking white trash.  Oh, totally.  Please.  I need...  It's only for an emergency, and I feel the emergency for a personal water crash. 
[02:45:00]  I'd love to see you, if you never got this show, where you'd be now.  It would be awesome.  Oh, my God.  It would be so bad.  You'd be falling asleep on somebody's fucking roof at noon.  I would.  Yeah.  He'd be wearing shorts and fucking work boots.  Yeah.  Yes.  He'd have Daisy Dukes.  I was...  Right now, you'd be yelling, Ma, we got any baloney left or what?  Oh, God.  I had to move back home.  Three failed marriages.  After one, I knew that was a...  I'll never get married again. 
[02:45:30]  I got an idea.  I know you can drop the prenup thing in.  Just leave it.  Get a PDF of it.  Just leave it open on the computer screen.  That's good.  And then when she goes to use the computer, she could be like, John, what is this?  What's going on?  Because we have a shared home computer.  Yes.  We have a big PC we both use.  Wasn't that your engagement present?  Yeah, yeah.  I got her a 1993 Dell, and we both use it.  No, that's a good...  Yeah.  I should leave it around in all the places she likes to look. 
[02:46:00]  Or I'll just put something in my wallet if she ever goes through it that says, hi, I wish  we had a prenup.  No, what you ought to do is this.  Use reverse psychology.  You bring it up to her and go, look, I mean, I feel like you're doing really well.  Oh.  And if things were to not work out, I would wind up getting more than I was supposed to,  and I would like us to have a prenuptial just so we both kind of...  That would be so worth it to do just for me to do the acting performance of trying to  be like, hey, I've been thinking about something.  You know, it's for your benefit. 
[02:46:30]  Why don't you see if the Chinese guys can put in a fortune cookie?  Wow.  Hey, why don't you sign a prenup?  Your winning numbers are six, nine, four.  Oh, my God.  Your winning numbers are 30 million in 50 years.  How could you be so mean to them when they've been worshipping you for so long?  Oh, my God.  That was very, very fast. 
[02:47:00]  I don't know who's going to top that one.  That was a build-up.  Wow, that was a good one.  Holy shit.  That is a good thing.  Yeah, I don't know how you would approach it, really.  I'm sorry.  Does she make any money at all?  I hope it works.  Yeah, she makes money.  He's the only one on the couch that you guys are worried about him getting a prenup.  The rest of us are like, fucking yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  You can tell he's going places.  You didn't get one.  DeRosa is going to have to give him a velvet painting and a couple books. 
[02:47:30]  He has some shitty tattoos.  And every one of those books is called Cheat.  Because it didn't sell?  God damn, motherfucker.  I thought that that was a fucking gem.  What?  They don't know the book.  That's right.  Me?  Because it didn't sell.  It's a paradigm joke.  That's a paradigm joke.  You put yourself in a situation.  The book sold.  The book sold.  It did well, Bobby.  It did well.  It did okay.  If fucking Billy Bird didn't become famous in the middle of it, it would have done better.  Yeah, that always hurts a book sale when a guy gets famous. 
[02:48:00]  That's what killed John Grisham was getting notoriety.  You're missing the points.  What did you ask me, John?  I don't remember now.  Oh, shit.  This fucking guy's back.  You're like an elf.  He is.  I like a little scarf.  He has like an Arafat scarf.  Like he's going to fucking take war photos in Syria.  How many pictures do you need of six out-of-shaped dudes on a couch? 
[02:48:30]  Six out-of-shaped dudes.  What about DiStefano and Mulaney looks like a late stage of AIDS, but still thin?  I feel like I look early AIDS.  You do.  1981, I don't know.  I haven't yet.  I'm sort of like, yeah, I've had a cough lately.  I don't know what it is.  John, you have a...  Like the guy that Jenny dates in Forrest Gump, which is like, I've got this new thing.  And they're like, groovy.  Looking like that is how he got the guy to fuck him in the first place.  John's got an Anthony Perkins circus Psycho 3. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, man.  Going on right now.  Oh, that was wordy.  Joe, I'll tell you what bothered everybody.  You said Circa, and we hated you for it.  That's exactly where it was.  Chris, this is a radio show.  We're talking to the microphone.  I know.  What the fuck happened to you?  I was listening.  I'm laughing at you guys.  Well, go sit over there if you're going to listen.  You sound like Pesci's mother scolding fucking Ray Liotta.  What?  He doesn't talk.  He just talks.  What the fuck kind of people are there? 
[02:49:30]  They fucking sit there and say nothing, cocksucker.  Who is that?  Fucking Mulaney's in good shape.  Joe's an angry baby.  Well, he's in great shape.  But why don't you talk?  I'm not.  I'm not.  You guys.  I'm not in great shape.  No.  Why don't you talk, I said.  Oh, you mean that?  Well, I was talking before.  He thinks Joe's trying to fuck him.  I feel like this, you know, like I'm the newest and I just feel like if I, you know.  No, Joe, I'm the newest.  No, I know you.  But I'm talking about like in all this.  The least successful or the newest?  Yes.  Joe's the least successful. 
[02:50:00]  True.  No, I'm the newest, I said.  Oh, sorry.  Okay.  He's a good.  Chris has.  I got to do this.  Chris has blown by most of us on this couch right now.  A year ago, he's going, yo, so do you think I should host for somebody out Bananas?  And now he's got fucking TV shows and everything.  He's fucking popping hard right now.  Yeah.  The answer is no.  Don't host at Bananas.  Do you think I should?  How do you feel about the Rose's new tattoos?  That's a good in for you.  Oh, that's good.  Let me see.  You had a lot of fun with them.  That one. 
[02:50:30]  That's still healing.  What is it?  A ladder?  Although the metal stars never will.  What is that?  A ladder?  Oh, yes.  Oh, hey.  A ladder.  Wow.  His tattoo looks like a ladder.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  The best part is when people see them, it's always an innocent insult about his tattoo.  Like he didn't mean anything by that, but it just looks like a fucking ladder.  It just looks like a ladder.  Oh, God.  I mean, it's sick of school.  But, you know, my girlfriend has insane tattoos, so that, you know, you know, Carly. 
[02:51:00]  Yes.  Like, are they good, though?  They're done very well?  Yeah, she's got, like, sick portraits.  Look, is one of them a crossed-out Ghostbuster?  Yeah, he has the sign, the bad religion, that on his bicep there.  Almost bicep.  It's just a circle with a line.  When Kurt said, it means no bicep.  You told me I was the sixth guy to say that to him.  26, everybody says that.  Everybody says the same.  Yeah, because it's a shitty tattoo.  It's funny.  But it was red when you got it. 
[02:51:30]  That's what you did to improve that?  It just make it dark?  I colored it black because the red looked like Ghostbusters.  It looked goofy.  So I colored it black.  Oh, yeah.  That's how you fix the fucking tattoo?  You look like you're in, like, a shitty prison.  Joe keeps getting, like, first drafts of tattoos.  Why didn't you get it, like, moved over your Zappa Lives tattoo?  You don't like that?  What's wrong with Zappa Lives?  I like that he does it.  Because he does it.  Yeah.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah, that's true. 
[02:52:00]  You want to say After MASH made it?  File that one with a Sandy Duncan joke.  I really, could I have picked a more recent show that fucking bombed?  Which a lot of Nick and Night.  That was 83.  What do you want, man?  I made some decisions when I was in the chair.  I want you to stop marking your body with a new tattoo every festival.  Yeah, stop getting tattoos at a fucking mall.  All right, I'll take it. 
[02:52:30]  I'll take a couple Chinese guys and a fucking Arab laughing.  I did it.  You have a fucking picture of a fish tattooed on your arm.  When did you get it?  What age, Bobby?  Uh-oh.  Oh, Bobby's going to show the tattoo.  Bobby got it when he's 12.  Were you really 12?  In Bobby's defense, that's not done.  He's going to get chips and tartar sauce tattooed on the other arm.  There he is.  All right, Joe.  There he is.  Welcome back, Joe. 
[02:53:00]  Joe's back.  Joe's back.  Oh, shit.  But you know what?  You can say what you want.  It's good work, though.  Yeah.  Like, this is my work.  The bottom, this is two tattoo artists.  This is done in San Francisco, okay?  This bottom half was done in New York City.  Both artists are famous.  I went in.  I researched the artists.  I went through all their art.  I didn't go in like at three and come out fucking at 315 with a fucking tattoo.  You didn't think to go on a whim with Kyle Kinnean and have him not help you? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, I didn't get something Norton said to me after a show.  Keep kicking him the ass, dude.  No, after a show, I'd be like, let me go wake them up.  That doesn't work with me.  I'm very funny.  I know you are.  Yes.  Is that a true thing, that story of that that keep kicking him in the nuts that he said that  to you and you found out?  No, he says it to everybody.  I know.  We learned that.  He said it on the phone.  But can we get one thing straight?  During a radio interview.  It's on the answering machine at the comic strip.  Can I just...  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  Joe originally asked him to put...  Could you say we have an 8 and a 1030?  Holy shit.  Can I just settle...  I love that you thought he said it just to you.  No, he didn't think that.  In Joe's mind, though.  I never thought that.  Why would you...  Why then immortalize it on your body forever?  Here's why.  Here's why.  Because you thought it was like R.I.P.D., that movie, like it burned in your arm, like  from Carlin himself.  Nobody saw that movie.  Maybe they saw the commercial for the preview. 
[02:54:30]  No, this is...  This is...  Could that movie, by the way, they just took Men in Black and just put a cowboy hat on it.  Get back to the tattoo.  It's not happening.  Sorry.  I was trying to dance around it a little bit.  It's not happening.  What I was going to say is, I knew he didn't say it just to me, and the reason I got it  is that because he said it to me, and I wrote it on a piece of paper.  I was like, oh, that's really cool.  And then I looked up an interview with him, and at the end of the interview, they said, 
[02:55:00]  what advice do you give young comics?  And he said, I always tell them, keep kicking them in the nuts.  And I was like, wow, he said that to me, too.  I was like, one of the guys, he said it.  That's cool.  And that's why I wanted to get it.  I knew he didn't just say it to me, but every time this comes up, somebody goes, this  fucking idiot thought he just said it to him, fucking jerk.  Okay, let me correct everybody.  This fucking idiot knew he said it to everybody, and still got it. 
[02:55:30]  You should have gone, thanks for coming.  Drive safe.  Next week, we have John Mulaney.  Now, the other thing with it, though, is couldn't it have been done in like a nice kind of almost  cursive writing or something?  It's just stamp letters.  Yeah.  Like, who did that?  They should be, you know, brought up on charges.  Who is the tattoo artist? 
[02:56:00]  This is what happened.  I called this girl who was a roommate of a friend of mine.  Oh, boy.  There you go, roommate of a friend.  Joe's trying to get blowjobs.  That's it.  Joe's trying to get pussy.  Hold on, Bob.  Let's not scold Joe for that.  Oh, okay.  Oh, look at Joe trying to get his dick wet with a mouth.  Yeah, no.  What's wrong with you?  No, you can scar my body for life with a shitty tattoo.  Just suck my dick.  Yeah, it's stupid.  I don't disagree with that.  I wasn't trying to do that.  She did this one, and I really liked what she did. 
[02:56:30]  And the reason I went to her for this one was not because I was trying to do the Zappa one.  And I didn't go to her because I was trying to fuck her.  I went to her because I never got a tattoo, and I knew her, and I was like, all right,  I want to go to somebody I know.  So she did this one, and I told her what I wanted to do here.  She's like, that's great.  She goes, meet me on this day at this time.  I will bring a bunch of fonts with me, and we'll figure out what looks best.  I go, great.  She shows up.  She's 40 minutes late.  She doesn't have any fonts.  That's when you leave.  Then you don't get it.  Holy fuck.  Here's the thing.  Exactly.  Oh, boy. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, my God.  Come on, Joe.  Hey, uh.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I fucked up.  She didn't bring the fonts?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  She didn't bring her fucking pheasant stencils to put on?  All right.  Just listen.  Continue, Joe.  Melini, when you get fonts.  Did he really say fonts?  Jimmy was getting that.  Yeah.  He could not not say that one.  I wanted to go somewhere with it, but I just couldn't. 
[02:57:30]  She brought Times New Roman, but no San Serif like we talked about.  If only there was a way to look at fonts without a woman bringing them to you.  If only somehow they were available.  She has the information.  She's running a little late, but she'll be here.  I was getting to that.  I went through.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Melini.  I sat at my computer, and I typed these letters in in 80 fucking different fonts on a piece 
[02:58:00]  of paper, and I thought...  I picked the worst one.  It's my point.  So what happened after she was 40 minutes late?  She shows up 40 minutes late, and I go, look, I don't know.  I thought this font was good, and she just goes, yeah, yeah, no, that's great.  What was she 40 minutes late for?  Having her Parkinson's therapy?  Yeah, her and Michael J. Fox were thumb wrestling.  So the font we went with was Ben Franklin's print shop. 
[02:58:30]  You know what?  The fucking tattoo stinks, and I fucked up.  Okay, man.  You know what?  But we know that.  We want to know how it got to that point.  Why did you meet somebody in a park?  She doesn't have a fucking tattoo.  Didn't she draw it on your arm first?  Ah, good one.  Like, there's that.  Yeah.  And then you saw the drawing of it.  You're like, perfect.  This is the...  You should have got the blowjob first, man.  You should have emptied your balls out and used your head. 
[02:59:00]  This is the ultimate...  This is the ultimate point of the whole thing.  Yeah.  She put the stencil on my arm, and I was a little nervous, and I was a little panicked  because she was, like, late and stuff, but this is the fucking mistake I made.  I looked at her the way you look at, like, your doctor.  Like, when you never just say to your doctor, do you ever go, you know, doc, my side hurts.  Do you think that could be cancer?  And your doctor goes, no, it's this.  Stop.  You're fine.  And you just go, okay, you know what I'm talking about.  I'm being crazy.  If your doctor met you 40 minutes late in a park... 
[02:59:30]  You see, it's not just the diagnosis part.  And your doctor forgot everything he was supposed to bring.  Oh, I don't have a scalpel, but...  What are you going to do?  I fucked up.  Look, it's too late for you.  I fucked up.  I just trusted her.  I brought up all the things I was worried about.  It's just tit in the middle of it.  There's two big Ks.  Does that look Aryan to you?  And she was like, no, no.  It's not supposed to be tit.  And she started talking to me with this, like, attitude of, like, you're being a fucking idiot. 
[03:00:00]  What are you talking about?  And I was just like, hey, she's the artist, and she did Johnny Knoxville's tattoo, so she must  know what she's talking about.  Why the period at the end?  That bothers me more than anything.  That was...  The period at the end.  That was actually a friend of mine's idea.  What friend?  She whipped her dick out.  By the way, what you should say is, that's an ex-friend of mine's idea.  No, it was a friend of mine's girlfriend's idea.  And I was like, oh, that's...  I don't know.  Guys, guys.  I just didn't think it through. 
[03:00:30]  Guys.  All right, look.  Stop crying.  Just fuck you and take this pounding.  I'm not...  I've been taking this pounding for two weeks.  You're going to take it for life.  Take it for life.  But then there's part two.  The cover-up sucks just as bad as the original one.  What two?  What's the cover-up?  Oh, right.  Absolutely.  We're only talking about the original tattoo.  Now, he originally only had the letters.  Right now, it looks like a ladder.  He's got these fits.  That's the worst part.  And then he decided it was going to be better if you put it in a little box that is supposed  to be a microphone.  Is that what we're getting at? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, where's the top of the microphone?  You know, it's...  That's not a microphone.  Was it Bob Barker's microphone?  Oh, that's what he says.  He was going for a mic.  I want it to look like an old-school mic.  Why?  You're not an old-school comic.  I...  What the fuck did...  You've got an old-school...  Let me see.  It doesn't look like a mic.  Let me see.  I know it doesn't.  People say it looks like a burning cigarette.  It looks bad.  It's fucked up.  Hey, listen.  Mulaney, when you get a prenup tattooed on your own, just because Andy said it.  Ah, yes.  I said it.  We'll get it in a weird box.  Where'd you get your tattoos there, hipster? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, why don't you go where this guy went?  Can you...  Yeah.  I got him done in Ontario.  Can you get...  Can you hook him up with a fix?  I had a guy email me...  Will you suck his dick and get him?  I had a guy email me from hearing this pounding...  When this shame pounding happened last week and the week before.  Yes.  I had a guy call me.  A guy email me, and he goes,  Dude, I'm an artist.  I'll do it for free.  You're fine.  He goes, I've seen it.  He goes, we'll fix it. 
[03:02:00]  Don't worry about it.  Wow.  But here's the thing.  I don't want to get it fucking...  Once I get it covered, that's it, dude.  There's one more run on this fucking thing, and that's it.  I would just burn it.  You've got to get it covered.  Just get a hot iron and burn it.  At this point, you have to get it fixed.  Fixed.  Yeah.  Why did you want a microphone around?  You have to.  A lot of people like it.  A lot of people...  No one likes it.  The fucking...  Who are you kidding?  The drummer from Def Leppard has a better-looking left arm than you do. 
[03:02:30]  Fuck.  Fuck.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  All Joe's tattoos are from the elbow down, because they can't do it on the shoulder.  This is...  Get it?  No shoulders?  Yeah.  So, look at you quietly laughing over there.  I see you.  Let the laughter out of that microphone.  Me?  Yes.  What are you talking about?  I'm just fucking joking, Chris. 
[03:03:00]  Jesus Christ.  Respect to Chris's shoulders.  No, I'm not.  I was...  Listen, I don't have tattoos.  I got eczema.  Yeah, I'd love if Chris talked about the eczema.  You get your tattoos.  Shut the fuck up, kid.  Yeah.  You got eczema?  What are you going to do?  I got eczema.  Hold on.  Eczema where?  It's like on my...  I had it on my...  Well, it's not that bad now, but I was going to, you know...  I can't get really tattoos.  I don't know.  Just my skin flakes.  It's gross.  I got some weird shit.  Did you get it taken care of or something?  Psoriasis.  No, I was.  I don't know.  I had a weird... 
[03:03:30]  I know a good person to see in a park.  You met her in a park.  I mean, you guys just adding fake facts to this story.  What did you say?  You said you met her in a fucking park.  You said you met her in a park.  I never said that.  He said that.  No, I think you said that.  He goes, dude, you met her in a park, dude.  And then it becomes fact.  Where'd you meet her?  He made up the thing where he goes, you think he just said it to you, dude?  It's like, I never said that.  Where did you meet her?  Where'd you meet her?  At the tattoo shop she works in. 
[03:04:00]  Did he say fucking park?  No, he didn't say that.  I think he said park.  No, I said she's a friend.  She's my friend's rooming.  Where did you meet to do the consultation for that?  At the shop that she works in.  That was indoors.  At the shop.  Am I out of my...  That was made in a shop.  I don't believe there were ceilings around when you made that decision.  At the shop.  Then how did she not have the font if she was at the shop?  How was she late to her shop?  Why didn't she have the font?  She showed up late and she's going, I'm so sorry, I'm late.  And I go, well, I have some fonts, dude.  And she's like, oh, let me see what you have.  And she just kind of just didn't draw attention to her. 
[03:04:30]  That's your place.  They don't have the fonts?  Hey, the fonts.  How did he do it again?  I don't play yet.  I love it.  We wash our needles so you don't get...  Hey!  Hey!  You know, I fucked up.  It was a mistake.  It was a mistake.  I like this one.  I don't give a fuck on anybody.  The Ghostbusters cover up?  That's why I fucked it up.  But the rally...  It's not...  It's kind of fucked up.  Like, it's not...  I like the red better. 
[03:05:00]  She fucked up on this...  When she fixed it...  She didn't do this one.  This is somebody else.  All right.  Well, that guy fucked up, too.  Dude, the red was better.  The line isn't straight.  And your placements on them look like you just kind of threw darts at a board and saw  where...  I'll tell you why, dude.  Because you kind of have the body of that ghost from the Ghostbusters.  So it was like a cool tie-in.  There's no real shape to it.  Oh, no.  Oh, Joe.  I was trying to think of an eyebrow joke.  I couldn't get to one fast enough.  Something Harold Ramis eyebrows.  I don't fucking know. 
[03:05:30]  See?  I should have left it alone.  I couldn't think of it.  Dude, I don't blame you.  I mean, who wouldn't go for a Harold Ramis eyebrow reference?  And this is coming from After Mash and Sandy Duncan.  I know.  I know.  I had a couple of fucking complete duds.  He had a doozy earlier about my mother the car.  See?  What the fuck is that?  It's a very old show.  I know that show.  Very old.  How do you know his mom's spirit goes into the car or something?  Yeah, it's the one.  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  Quality programming back then.  Unlike this.  I think this was a very successful show today.  Absolutely.  Wow.  We should wrap up.  Yeah.  Before we really fucking.  Before we really fuck this up.  Right.  What a great time.  I got it here.  We'll bring it back here.  I got to say, goddamn Montreal's been fantastic today for the show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Brought it right back around. 
[03:06:30]  Should we do the plugs?  You guys need plugs?  Yeah, we got to plug everybody.  Thank all of them.  So we're John?  Yeah.  What do you want to plug?  I got a show tonight at 1130 at La Stral?  Bass Trail?  Something like that.  Uh-oh.  1130.  It's something French.  Yeah.  Something French.  Go to the place with the French name.  Yeah.  Come to it, though.  Yeah, that's tonight.  Yeah.  John's a great, great comic.  Thank you, Jim.  It's very nice of you to say.  He's a truly great comic.  Yeah, unbelievably funny.  And Bobby, what are you doing today?  I got my podcast, I think, here at 330 after Colin's keynote. 
[03:07:00]  Okay.  And all you assholes are on it.  So if you want to come back.  And then I'm doing the dating show and nasty show tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  With Tom Papa, right?  Okay.  Tom Papa's doing the dating show and Slayton is doing the – and Jimmy Carr.  It's fucking hilarious.  We have him tomorrow.  He's coming.  Oh, my God.  He's funny.  Jimmy's great.  Oh, my God.  And Papa's – he's got his special on Epix this weekend.  Coming out this Friday.  Yeah, I forgot to mention that.  What's it called?  I don't know. 
[03:07:30]  Freaked Out.  Freaked Out.  Oh, Freaked Out.  Yeah.  Is that the one that Rob Zombie directed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that a bizarre?  Yeah, that is just –  It looks good, man.  The fact that they're friends is the weirdest fucking thing.  Yeah, it's like –  Tom has weird friends.  Like, they're really good friends.  It's like when a dog and a turtle are friends on YouTube.  It's fucking a turtle.  I love it.  I love it.  It's so true.  Jesse Joyce?  Jesse.  Yeah, doing a TV taping tomorrow, the Talk of the Fest at Club Soda Friday night, and 
[03:08:00]  then I'm in L.A. working on the James Franco roast for three weeks.  Oh, look at you.  That's what I'm doing.  Joe?  Where are you going to get your tattoo?  God damn it.  You beat me to it.  I was going to do a tattoo job.  I've got to have Joe do it.  No, no.  We're all friends.  You're among friends, Ricky.  Let's cover up your tattoo tomorrow on the show.  That would be good.  I can't.  It's still healing.  You can't do it yet.  I would do that, though.  I would absolutely fuck it.  Wow, that would be crazy.  Covered up with a machete.  That would be wild.  Are you dumb?  You fucked it up once. 
[03:08:30]  You think it's going to be a positive thing with these guys?  He can't even contain the evil.  Look how much he's just laughing.  I would love it.  It's just bubbling out of him.  My main show is Club Soda Friday night for Talk of the Fest for the TV.  They're taping it for TV, so come out for that.  I hope he looks like he's covering a golf tournament.  Next up on the green is...  Well, yeah, Kurt. 
[03:09:00]  Spit it out.  Midnight Surprise.  I'm doing the thing you're doing.  What am I doing?  I don't know.  Come to the Midnight Surprise.  Yeah, there's like a Midnight Surprise.  Well, I don't know the lineup, but I heard it's pretty good.  It's really good.  I'm doing that, too.  That's a crazy lineup.  That's Friday night.  Yeah, that's a fucking...  No, tonight I'm doing one.  Oh.  I'm doing one Friday night, a Midnight Surprise.  We're hosting one Friday night.  Let's talk about it.  I wonder if there's going to be a connection.  I don't know.  How do you plug your fucking show if you can't?  It's a big surprise.  I know.  It's sold out.  It's good.  That sounds like something Jim pays Vietnamese people to do to his mouth. 
[03:09:30]  Midnight Surprise.  And, of course, tomorrow I'm on the New Faces of Comedy show at the Catacombs, I think.  Yeah.  Are you sure?  This is on the Quiet Faces of Comedy.  Yeah, I'm on the Quiet...  The Shy Guy.  Have you done a setup here yet?  Huh?  Have you done a setup here yet?  Last night.  Did you do what?  Was it good?  Yeah, it was fun.  It was the first show, first New Faces show, so it was fun.  Yeah, I imagine you're going to crush on New Faces. 
[03:10:00]  Because some of those acts are very good, and some of them are newer.  You're more than ready for that.  I like how nice he was.  Some of them are really good, and some of them are newer.  Well, it's hard to tell when someone's brand new.  You know what I mean?  Some of the new guys that stink are going to be great today.  I like that a nice, clean-cut guy like him's on New Faces.  All those guys just look like they're fucking running moonshine.  He's New Faces.  Hey, I've got a beard and a fucking interesting.  Fuck off.  No offense against you.  Hey, did anybody go to the gala last night and see my gala?  No, what is her name? 
[03:10:30]  Sometimes you've got to throw them out there just to keep the funny going.  I can give it, but I've got to get it, too.  Fucking Norton is fucking lightning fast.  You fucking thin little worm.  I guess I have one plug.  He's plugging retroactively.  I'm doing the Whitney Cummings gala Sunday night. 
[03:11:00]  It's like the live HBO up here, so I don't know if there's tickets available or not, but  it'll be on Sunday night here.  Papa's doing a show up here, too, right?  He's doing the dating show with me, and then Schumer's up here, too.  Yes.  Schumer's got her own show.  She won't come on our show.  We can't book Amy.  What?  I don't know.  She's busy.  No way.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Get that bitch on this fucking show.  Is Tom hosting the dating show?  Tom is closing it.  We have Godfrey hosting it, which means it's going to be late.  I want to get on that.  I need to do sets.  You want to get on the dating show? 
[03:11:30]  Is it just stand-up?  It's stand-up, yeah.  I need sets.  I've got to warm up.  Just go to the comedy works.  Why is it called the dating show?  There's a bunch of shows you can jump on.  They put me on last.  I don't want to go on fucking last.  I've got to get the six.  You say you don't want to go on last.  I said that yesterday, and you're going on last?  Have these fucking assholes protest.  That'll work, yeah.  Yeah, they're all hyped up.  Chinese guys can light themselves on fire.  Wait till you get a good spot. 
[03:12:00]  You better wrap it up.  It ain't getting better than that.  Thank you.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  From the, what?  No, no.  From the last festival.  See you tomorrow.  We're out.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is now over.  This special live broadcast from Montreal's Just for Laughs Comedy Festival will repeat today at 3 p.m. Eastern, noon Pacific.
