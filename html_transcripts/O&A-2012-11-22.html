<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and highly vulgar affair, featuring a revolving door of guests and a wide range of topics.  The show began with a segment dubbed "A Very Chipperson Thanksgiving," hosted by Lyle Lovett.  Amy Schumer recounted a graphic tale of a sexual encounter with a cab driver at age 18.  This was followed by appearances from Chris Rock and Colin Quinn, who discussed their careers, experiences at the Comedy Cellar (including Chris Rock's aggressive tactics in securing better spots), Chris Rock's film "Two Days in New York," and Colin Quinn's opinions on the Knicks and Jeremy Lin.  Bob Kelly and Bob Saget also guested, with a poorly-received magic act by "Magic Bob" and his shirtless assistant, Sam, adding to the show's already raucous atmosphere.  The hosts and guests engaged in numerous sexually suggestive and crude jokes throughout this segment.

The show continued with more bizarre encounters involving "Magic Bob," whose act involved throwing coins into drinks and whose shirt smelled, according to the hosts, like "baby farts."  His dramatic exit through a window was recounted in detail.  This led to a discussion of childhood magic tricks and a humorous, crude digression into "gay porn magic."  A main segment featured Will Ferrell and Amy Schumer, among other guests, discussing their comedy careers, experiences with improv (including the Groundlings), and stand-up.  Ferrell shared anecdotes from his *Saturday Night Live* days, including bombing sketches and the pressures of live performance, his fluency in Spanish in a recent movie, a Rolling Stone article about him, and his social media experiences.  Amy Schumer also shared a negative sexting experience.  The show also addressed Colin Quinn's Twitter rant accusing Will Ferrell of stealing the *Anchorman* concept and having a drug problem, with Quinn calling in to discuss the media’s overblown and unverified reporting of the incident.

Comedian Bobby Lee’s appearance was marked by an unexpected panic attack in the studio, fueled by perceived movement of equipment and a hallucination of a rabbit, leading to a discussion of his unusual underwear choices.  His anxious departure was followed by an interview with Steven Wright, who detailed his career, focusing on his success on *The Tonight Show*, his Oscar win, his unique comedic style, experiences with fame, germaphobia, and anecdotes from his career, including a bad gig and the origins of his delivery.  He also spoke about other comedians, including Dane Cook and Rich Vos.

A subsequent segment involved a discussion of comedic influences, including Johnny Carson, Robert Klein, David Brenner, Woody Allen, and George Carlin.  This led into a segment with Rich Voss, who infamously revealed his passwords for Twitter, Facebook, and email, leading to his accounts being hacked by listeners.  The ensuing chaos, including profile picture changes and vulgar exchanges with a Kentucky listener named "Mo Step," who took over his Twitter account, was detailed extensively, along with Voss's wife Bonnie's reaction.  The segment chronicled the widespread online disruption caused by the hack.

Finally, the show concluded with Patrice O'Neal and Luik discussing Illuminati conspiracy theories, featuring speculation about symbols on U.S. currency and participation from a caller identifying as a Mason.  A comedian recounted his experiences working on "A Few Good Men" with Jack Nicholson, sharing humorous anecdotes, including a Christopher Walken impression for Walken himself and Nicholson's story about a surreal encounter with Angelica Huston during the filming of "Chinatown." The conversation also touched upon the impact of Magic Johnson's HIV diagnosis on the set of "A Few Good Men," and Jack Nicholson's enduring coolness, aversion to interviews, and cultivated mystique.  The entire broadcast was characterized by frequent and pervasive use of vulgar language and highly absurd anecdotes.

[00:26:30]  know what i mean it's you know some guys are just better from the neck up than other guys right you  know what i mean yeah that energy that just positive reinforcement he rallied the whole team he  rallied the whole team made everyone better winner you know like uh paul o'neal is not a better does  not have better tools than bobby bonia but from the neck up he did and he had a better career  because he you know there's some guys just know how to do it every day man yeah it brought me back  to the knicks and now i'm like yeah a little fire under new york's ass i like felton i like felton but i 
[00:27:00]  really was excited to see what was going to happen with lynn you think the knicks blew it you think the  knicks could have done something there i mean i know that third year the contract was yeah but i mean  fucker but hey man amari's contract is crazy too i mean he's what the 10th best power forward in the  game you know so and lynn brought in so much money last year but plus the stock of the company went up  because they have the thing about lynn is you don't know how good he's gonna get yeah you know what i 
[00:27:30]  mean where the guys they have right now you know felton and kid they're good but they're this is  probably as good as they're gonna be yeah yeah probably you know i mean not disrespectfully  no but they're there you know exactly what they're gonna give you know what you're getting where lynn is  like wow this guy who knows what's gonna happen if he'd have had especially with jay kidd backing  them up and showing them some shit right showing them some shit man but you know york has a way of  getting these players after their prime they do it in all the sports you know what lynn will eventually be 
[00:28:00]  a nick again i guarantee you he will be a nick again but he's gonna be 32 yeah but they do make  good decisions too sometimes like remember ricky leday played for the yankees he was the hot young  prospect he had a great couple years and then they fucking traded him uh i think he was a left fielder  and you're like why would like he almost bobbled the ball during cones no hitter and you're like  why would they get rid of this guy you never heard from him again i remember i was talking to frank 
[00:28:30]  robinson one time and i forget who he was managing and i said oh you just got that guy from the  yankees he says the yankees never trade good players yeah it sounds good it's like oh you got  that guy from the yankees oh yeah that's right yeah oh he's got hepatitis he's fucking terrible  fucking narcoleptic yeah yeah but sometimes they'll make a decision that the fans look at and go what  the fuck maybe maybe there's something in lynn that they that they saw and it's not worth the 
[00:29:00]  money some surgery and all and i don't know i don't know and he's only 23 i know i'm dying  i mean i'm always a nick fan but that was the first time i was watching complete games every game  right like like i was watching the whole game it wasn't like i was playing with my kids like shut  up the nicks are on it was driving my wife nuts i'm like what you're you say you're a basketball fan  but i didn't realize to this extent i'm like no it's because of him he brought me back he brought me  he really got me excited so you think the nicks could win with uh carmelo anthony and then we 
[00:29:30]  can move i mean they're gonna win but can you win a championship a championship dude okay this  i know he's a great player because i argue this point that's why they shouldn't get real lit  i'll tell you a story i'm talking to mike i'm just i'm just johnny name drop that's fine right  i do it when i can i'm talking to michael jordan years ago right oh that's a good name and it was  right it was literally right after the nicks had acquired uh larry johnson alan houston and chris  chiles and i'd say to michael jordan hey we're gonna get you this year we're gonna kill you this 
[00:30:00]  year and michael jordan looks at me and goes you didn't get anybody we haven't stopped before  and once you know how to stop a guy you can stop a guy and so lebron and these guys they've beaten  these guys before that's why they should have kept lynn because the the new people will beat the  heat not old people not the old that's a great thought it's gonna be some new kid yeah because 
[00:30:30]  the teams couldn't figure out jeremy lynn right and lynn was like you know you had one bad game  against miami well you know james harden had five bad games against right right who did you hate more  as a nick fan uh or not you know as a rivalry uh jordan or reggie miller reggie miller reggie  because reggie miller was so arrogant you know just like smiley arrogant when michael jordan was  like i'm killing you but reggie jordan was like i'm killing you i got a grin yeah yeah and he's not 
[00:31:00]  like at least jordan you can say he's the greatest player of all time jordan's the greatest player of  all time and reggie miller had the the model wife on the sidelines you know jordan had a wife and  kids you know okay he's he's going through pain you know whatever you know and even when jordan  was suffering on some level he's suffering on some level even when jordan was playing your team you  just respected him so much because he was so damn good you forgot you started rooting for him like  oh wait yeah he's playing my team tonight yeah you always had this fantasy where he scored 50 
[00:31:30]  and your team was yes that was always that's always what you hoped for that'd be a perfect scenario  that never happened no well what else about two days in new york because i want to make sure  people how much french is in it and do you speak any french i speak no french okay that's that's  what's kind of fun and it's part of my character so it's not something i had to study speaking no  french all right someone's telling me these uh actors and actresses are huge in france is that  true i don't know yeah they're all pretty big in france i've been you know i was in france i was at uh 
[00:32:00]  can and all that stuff with them and no one knew me and everybody knew that they just knew them yeah  wow they really not know you in france i mean oh i mean they know me a little bit but because you did i know you  did london we talked about that one time you said you went over there and you did who was supposed to  do uh the i was just talking to a comic he was supposed to do the arena and then and then they  said chris snuck in and did the o2 first and michael jackson  there's 50 dates all of a sudden available no it was before well he had 50 it was before that it 
[00:32:30]  was a comedian was supposed to do it was it jimmy carr was it somebody somebody who just told me  and then they said that you came in with the first comic i think to do i think so yeah the o2 which  is a fucking massive is it yeah it's a that's like a real arena it's like playing the garden a few  nights so you know oh yeah you know yeah you guys you guys sell out you know that little place you  know you do your tours we were on we were on stage at the garden dice was uh nice nice when he did the  garden a few minutes on stage yeah as far as selling out is concerned uh you know i i like to say i sell 
[00:33:00]  out but you know the venues i just leave the fucking seat count off you know it's like i've  done westbury but of course with the curtain you know it's never the full you know what i mean  exactly there's a section of 90 people having a ball so what was that 16 000 people yeah something  like that was that your first time over there yeah that was my first and you went right into  an arena did you know i did like 10 shows at this other place you know the crazy thing was i  booked the comedy club i was like okay i'll play a week at the comedy 
[00:33:30]  club and i ended up playing like a couple of months playing big places wow i have my my ego  was like let's just play let's just play 500 seats and see how it goes see it's funny to hear you say  that too because you you're one of the biggest names but you still i guess like any other comic  walk in and go like fuck is are people going to show up to this yeah please please especially in  another country yeah place you haven't been so i was all about playing it small did you graham  graham norton show i've been obsessed with this i love the graham it's great right he's the best the 
[00:34:00]  best talk show host in the world is a gay guy from uh london i agree yeah yeah  i i mean besides the visual colors the beautiful set is he's just relaxed and comfortable and did  he we we watched a clip with gervais and ozzy and sharon osborne did he bring you  and the other because he introduced them all together and they all just kind of sat there  together and interacted yeah he first of all there's no commercials on the show then they tape  an hour and a half to edit to an hour so they make sure it works right yeah so let's cut out the 
[00:34:30]  half hour of nonsense oh i didn't realize that yeah yeah all right so you have plenty of time to  work plenty of time to be funny on it and it's you and and two other guests or one uh it was two other  me and that girl from twilight was the last time and so kristen stewart yeah kristen how hot is that  story man she didn't want me i was like what you mean i had a shot yeah everyone over 40 that's  matter is like i'm sitting there like i'm married she'll never want me 
[00:35:00]  if only i knew yeah she really went for the uh dude the older director guy that story has been  turning me on so much because it's like as much as i feel bad for robert pattinson and i relate to the  humiliation just to see a guy that good looking fucking getting it stuck to him there's something  satisfying about that don't you admire robert pattinson too because it's always great to  have something on somebody yeah yeah it's always great to have one on the one you love  well he gave me the boot all right good for him yeah he's gonna bite a new bitch that's right 
[00:35:30]  i think he's gonna be fine in the end oh please they're lining up i'm sure because they were gonna  last forever yeah exactly yeah she's 22 four years a long time with a fucking 22 year old girl  she just wanted to go out and you know he was probably boring in bed he's all good looking  guy like that can't be a good fuck he can't be jimmy's gotta think this you would know  whatever makes you sleep better at night all the 22 year old boys you  but i was gonna say because he's like really good looking but i'm not really good looking and i'm not 
[00:36:00]  a good fuck so there goes that theory but i'll say he doesn't have to earn it a lot of a lot of  a lot of like good-looking women are not good because they don't have to earn  they do not have to earn it no yeah i concur so they're terrible because they just expect laying there is  going to be enough because because their nakedness is an event yes right there's equity in that  there's definitely equity and just them being naked maybe maybe there is something wrong with  because like they'll just get undressed and i'm like i need i again i need something dirty with  this but for most people that's enough you gotta lay off the porn oh man dude it's fucking it ruins 
[00:36:30]  everything it ruins everything i'm like i think i'm i don't know 40 days pornless oh you're trying  it but you're actually trying to yeah do you sleep but there's a story there why what happened  that you said i gotta stop you just got first of all it's just i don't know if i ever told the story  on this show but i remember years ago my good friend another name got rick rubin gives me a box of  porn literally a box like he's friends with the vivid people and like a box of porn when you get a box of 
[00:37:00]  of fresh porn you're like this is yeah we can actually relate to that you can relate to that  we've gotten the box of porn it's four days later and you you haven't been on time to any meeting  you haven't written any jokes nothing's gotten done  and you're like okay you're like get take your  how dare you give me this box  you're on you know i give the box of porn the joiner and then he curses me out 
[00:37:30]  i can't get anything done how dare you give me a box of porn yeah that is a distraction it's a  hard thing to not go through um because it really does become a do you sleep i sleep better when i'm  not watching it like when i don't watch like like literally last night i was on the phone two o'clock  in the morning i'm having phone sex and i'm looking at old text messages and i was up until four  o'clock in the morning because i can't sleep but why don't you just i'm zoned in like why don't you just  nut and then you can sleep better well i mean that would make sense but i mean it's it's like 
[00:38:00]  you know you hold that back right yeah but just the visualization the porn the computer it keeps me  up i can't sleep yeah yeah you gotta you gotta sometimes just you know do you not watch they  need a porn patch actually just a porn patch do you do you not want real sex when you're watching porn  like i want less real sex when i'm into the porn run i think so yeah yeah yeah so man and then they  start complaining i mean you know believe me i've had girlfriends but what's the matter nothing  what i was just with the perfect woman that's what's the matter exactly i would do anything i 
[00:38:30]  want and now i have to negotiate with you exactly i have to look into your loving eyes yeah yeah  that was always made hard for me in a relationship you just finish and be done with it well you know  that's like say why not have one beer and go home to a guy who's fucking wrapped around a pole  it makes sense in hindsight but you know in the moment yes yes more fun to fucking zone out so  40 days what kind of emotions are coming up there has to be something because i feel good i feel good  i feel like i'm getting shit done really you look wow i finished a book what's a book what's a book 
[00:39:00]  reading or writing about books reading like i actually read a book damn it's harder right it's  harder to read when you fucking zoned out on porn did you start it after i started it after and it's  like oh okay wow i read it like in a real amount of time that a person a grown-up that can read  that is the statement of somebody who was jerking off to a lot of porn like i'm proudly going i read a 
[00:39:30]  book it's a start it didn't take me four months to read fuck yeah man holy shit because it becomes  harder to concentrate like on just a long form relaxing read than it does on just those quick  you ever go to like there's a certain size i don't want to say that you just go to these mega sites  and like you can't even focus on one fetish because it's all oh yeah yeah yeah and it makes  it hard to enjoy any of it yeah you're just crazy the kid in the candy store no but i mean it's good  it's good to hear you're always looking for a better one a better clip it has to be a better 
[00:40:00]  clip it's like it has to be a better clip it's kind of like oh man have you been tempted to go back  there and what have you done when you're tempted i you know i've been okay i've been okay i mean  i'm sure i'll go back i'm no i'm no fool sure sure you're just seeing if you could do it obviously  yeah so and how long do you want to give yourself it's like a like a cleanse yeah  i'll have a big mac right now this is lemon juice and cayenne pepper you're doing that okay  something i do um do you have you gotten like angrier or or no like there's no other emotions i mean at 
[00:40:30]  first it was anger but now i'm actually kind of calm i can kind of sit with people  wow i don't even think about like looking at porn as being something that you you'd have to even stop  because it's affecting something like i maybe you're not doing it a lot well i i do it enough but it's  it's not crazy and i know if i just want to fucking tall soul as they say i just finish up and be 
[00:41:00]  through with it just fucking go to sleep i gotta block some twitter accounts then i'll be good  but do you know how encouraging that is to hear like just to be off porn for 40 days man that's a  long time jimmy loves hearing this because you're not alone jimmy you can do it too there's a there's  a documentary waiting to happen jim norton trying to go 40 days without porn all right now you think  god only knows what he'll latch on i went 17 days without jerking off about five years ago it was  actually really good for me but that's it's a rough one because the first time i did it was just an 
[00:41:30]  ugly scene like you know what i mean i was right back to the races tell us chris has to go in the  year because i don't know if we sold the movie i feel bad we haven't had chris in in a while and  gonna have another show on fx yes called totally biased starring kamal bell right yeah show i'm  producing is he a stand up come up oh he is okay and what does he kind of do just give his opinion  just to give a quick run yeah yeah it's kind of like marr yeah car stewart you know coming on it  right after louie okay that's a great time yeah great time slot louie's killing it again this year 
[00:42:00]  louie's killing it fx as a network is that episode with uh what's her name in the truck loved it oh my  god loved it he's unbelievable that's one of the funniest that might be the funniest episode of  television i've ever seen in my life he's now beloved louie he's beloved amazing i always knew it i  always knew it never doubted it for one second yeah even when we were making pootie tang pootie  tang yeah i knew louie was gonna do it but that's also encouraging last thing is is is to see like 
[00:42:30]  louie got killed for that movie and you know and i he told the story of how they took it out of his  hand but it's like it's nice to see that like you know you're fucking hosting the oscars and obviously  everybody knows you're a brilliant comic and louie's being treated as a brilliant comic it's just nice to  see that like even with something that the critics shit on there's the fucking light at the end of the  the time you're you're a comic you know and you guys know there's only 12 good comics  you know i mean like you know maybe 15 is pushing it i'll go 12 and you know then guys you can count

[00:43:30]  on stage and off you know that motherfucker was a funny guy there's a lot of reasons why that hurts  but the one is knowing he was about ready to fucking finally hit oh he'd have fucked it up  uh yeah but that would have been fun too but that would have been fun too he would have had his own  version of chappelle yeah yeah yeah uh uh you know chappelle sucker cat he would have had his  that's his own version of comedy sexual executives they acted like fainting goats when he was around 
[00:44:00]  why yeah we'd definitely be asking why won't patrice work i missed that voice why did he do it  chris rock on twitter and chrisrock.com is his website i mean he's brilliant what we say we all  know chris and uh good luck with the movie yeah and good luck with uh uh uh the come back on the  porn it's good yeah that's very inspiring starting sunday when i'm back  the opian anthony channel presents a very chipperson thanksgiving you guys know there's only 12 good

[01:03:00]  and she did material she stood up and did material which for is pretty ballsy because  i wouldn't be able to do that no yeah that's she's obviously a sociopath  is that your real hair yes okay  no follow questions no i just want to know  do you understand that i did i did i i um i did it very painfully you started doing it or  after you started no i did it for i did it poorly for like a year and uh um maybe 
[01:03:30]  got 15 minutes of material right that's a lot for a year you ever sexed with amy  oh god i thought maybe it was him yeah okay  it's a tough crowd she won't tell us yeah oh she won't yeah imagine i'm like when he left i'm like  it was well it was well yeah it was well no i had i had some excellent star trek material  oh nice so did i for years my opening joke was an awful star trek alien joke  what was it what was it come on it was humiliating um it was something that but it was such an 
[01:04:00]  obvious setup like yeah it was something like you know star trek they would always meet these aliens  that speak english like you don't know it's going to be and it'll be some miami joke after like  he's still trying to sell it  he's still looking for that target you know i'm trying to find some redeeming value it's  it's gonna work one day one day it'll work you'll find it you just did like improv after that like  from stamp to improv uh no i well i i was doing stand-up and then i found uh the groundlings  groundlings theater on melrose and they had a whole you know you could take their classes and 
[01:04:30]  and i i immediately found out that i was i was more suited for that plus when you bombed you  weren't alone right when you bombed you were with a group of people yeah yeah there's no one to play  you can walk off stage going what the hell was that what were you doing yeah yeah immediately point  the finger and what's what's the rule of improv you don't say no or you always go with you can always  exactly you can never deny something exactly right what's the word amy yes and oh yes and  which is how sexting is supposed to go yes right you say something and then somebody's supposed to 
[01:05:00]  continue okay she had a terrible sexting experience recently yeah the guy was an  asshole yeah he did not yes and me yeah he's like uh excuse me but yeah which is really i have other  ideas i where i want this scene to go did he did he write my word what's going on here pretty much  he just wrote back question marks i am fanning myself right now it was really disappointing yeah i think  improv is hard like i i find that scarier than stand-up like to be able to go out there and 
[01:05:30]  just uh i've watched some bad improv is unwatchable and good improv is awe-inspiring right exactly yeah  good improv feels like you're watching a magic trick yeah it's it's incredible but you're right it and  and you have to go through the bad to get to the good feel good yeah some great people  um phil hartman is phil hartman or phil hartman jennifer coolidge peewee herman jennifer coolidge  uh uh uh lisa kudrow um unfamiliar uh no no okay not ringing any bells no no who are the ones though 
[01:06:00]  that never you never hear from like you always hear well the groundlings let me uh blast off some  names for you oh god it's like what about um joey pepetone yeah he's invoking now not doing a whole lot  isn't john candy was he ground no he's second city he was second but there's the groundling second  city and then uh ucb now it's ucb those are like the three big ones right three three factories of  comedy yeah if you want to make it go right there just guarantee pay your money you're in your teachers 
[01:06:30]  who were in your class the year before but that's the thing with improv you it's just like stand-up in  that you have to you can kind of seem like you have to suck at it for a while i've seen friends who  graduating shows at ucb and they they can't find the end to scenes so they literally just put the  lights out so they move on to the next scene they shut down the electricity because it's that  uncomfortable kind of like an snl sketch when they just bring the applause up yeah yeah wait  commercial what do you do when you're bombing an snl sketch because that to me is the scariest thing  because i've never seen anybody break the fourth wall and address it like they're actually really 
[01:07:00]  good at not yeah this is going nowhere i just yeah i know for me in dress rehearsal i if the audience if  it was not working the tendency is to speed up and just get off off the stage but i would just  purposely slow down and torture the audience if you if you hate this and hate me now i'm just you  know what i'm gonna make it twice as long that's amazing that's balls i don't know what i don't i don't 
[01:07:30]  know what why the masochist excited me would allow that but i was just like okay you hate it you're  gonna hate it a lot more do you have a trick for not breaking um do you like think about something  really sad or you just when you're in the scene you don't i'm always thinking about things that  are sad oh my god i found out he was the darkest dude ever no i don't know i i just have been uh  able to you know kind of commit to something but yeah yeah yeah i'm not immune to it but yeah have you 
[01:08:00]  ever in a sketch have you ever ruined it laughing or ruined it by breaking the fourth wall uh i you know  i've been lucky that the times i've started breaking uh at least on saturday night live was  was usually when i was wearing a beard of some sort so i could kind of hide my laughter all right  keeping you know my beard from falling off so uh uh in fact this that that blue oyster colt cowbell  sketch we did if if you watch it yeah if you watch it i'm totally i'm just laughing but i have a big 
[01:08:30]  beard on so you can't tell and everyone else is laughing yeah that was one that really okay i'm  okay but you know that's a hard atmosphere we've been you know daryl's been on yeah colin obviously  a million times that's a really you you you can either take that or you can't because that seems  like a very very hard atmosphere to survive in if you're not thick-skinned yeah you you have to be  you know it's just you're shot through a cannon and that thing and you have to uh i mean we were  lucky when when i was hired we you know we had eight new cast members a whole whole new writing 
[01:09:00]  staff so we were yeah we were all thrown in together and we didn't we didn't know any better  no one expected anything either it was like oh let's see what these clowns can do totally  and then it ended up being like amazing i mean the worst part of it the worst part of it was the big  uh press conference we had to do we're like warren littlefield and we're like in front of all this  media and we're just all sitting there and we're all sweating and nervous and in our little  brand new clothes that the network stresses and so what funny little sketches are you going to be  doing hey what kind of wacky sketches what's your plan what's what you know what are you like and 
[01:09:30]  we're just like oh my plan i'm just hoping not to get fired i just want to get picked up yeah so  do you have that fear at first that you're going to get dumped is that like scary the first few times  ago if they cut a sketch like the first time you're supposed to be on oh yeah yeah i mean  you know once again like like lauren he had to use all of us so he couldn't uh there wasn't a time to 
[01:10:00]  you know really pick favorites or anything like that so um so we were kind of all used a bunch at  the beginning and uh and yeah and if and you know yeah they're you're kind of bummed if you're in one  thing and but then but then later if you've been on the show long enough you're like oh i'm only in two  pieces great oh yeah you get left i don't gotta go to rehearsal all right um the rolling stone  article that was just out about you yes it means which i haven't read oh it's great yeah yeah you  sound great in it okay good yeah everybody likes you everybody likes you yeah everybody really likes 
[01:10:30]  you yeah but they did it be the interviewer painted it like you've had this very charmed  like existence yeah yeah yeah yeah did that yeah i kind of i mean let's face it there's like we're  saying there's there's just as many people i can think of at the groundlings yeah that you have you  know he's got the just as funny as me automotive shop yeah so when i got hired at snl i'd come back  to the theater and and downplay it because you feel kind of i'd be like yeah it's okay it's all right  yeah living in new york yeah i don't know is it scary there yeah it's scary yeah it's uh there's 
[01:11:00]  there's nothing to do there aren't any good restaurants or anything anyway how are you you  good yeah yeah wichita's been really good to me you got that geico commercial okay yeah great  so it's like it's tough to stay in touch with those friends right it's uh you know but uh i just did a  movie with zach galifianakis and we were just talking about how that you know it is a game of inches and  that we both just got any other move or false step we literally could be doing you know being 
[01:11:30]  extras and whatever and just trying to make make a living here's how you know zach is famous yes i'm  working on my extra here's how you know zach is famous i was in a casino uh recently and uh i  fucking saw the the hangover pinball machine and zach is in a is on is on a slot machine i'm sorry yeah  i'm like that's how you know you're famous when you're on a slot machine in some random casino  the hangover slot machine yeah yeah yeah uh what happened with joan rivers she she said something 
[01:12:00]  recently and it's like how can anybody be pissed at you for real you know not recently that was a  that was a long time ago a long time ago and i this writer was like any anyone ever say anything bad  and i just go well there was this one time this week article where yeah joan rivers called me out  out of nowhere and for what talked about when we met and i was rude to her and i'm like i don't i don't  even know i don't know what she's talking about it and then i i was trying to figure out when did we ever  even meet and then i figured out the only time was on when she used to do the red carpet 
[01:12:30]  for like the golden globes and i the only thing i could track it back to was we were doing the the  red carpet and the uh the time was running out for when you had to get in because the show was about  to start and her producer was like just walk in go into the live shot and she's talking with mike  nichols and diane sawyer so i just walk into the live shot thinking she knows i'm going to do it  and she's like hello hello do you do you know who these people are i was like yes i do they're very 
[01:13:00]  famous oh hello mike nichols hello yes very important yeah we are all important famous people  they're totally laughing and they're like well hello and then she's like yeah but how could she not get  that hilarious i think she just didn't know taking her red carpet dude he's very seriously yeah i don't  know that was the only place oh okay figured out why don't you read the article do you not read stuff 
[01:13:30]  about yourself or you just haven't gotten to it just lazy yeah oh i will read it i just yeah  you get involved in a lot of uh a lot of like underground now too uh on the internet just kind  of friends of yours throwing yeah throwing stuff up online uh what what made you go down that road  um just you know just you know funny or die has been this great kind of playground for  for for stuff like that and uh and just it i think it kind of scratches that itch you still 
[01:14:00]  have from doing sketch comedy where you have an idea and it's not really it's it's not really good  for anything but a stupid four minute thing on the internet yeah but it's amazing together and and yeah  and take a half hour and shoot something and you know but it's not i mean i've i've filmed a couple  things with funny or die and they are it's an elaborate yeah they're like here's your call  time here's your call sheet yeah yeah isn't this the internet wait a minute yeah i did my my own 
[01:14:30]  makeup they're like oh well we're starting over because we're a real thing you know it's no joke  funny or die yeah it's a whole uh well-oiled machine there was another comedy website which i had done  something with florentine on um and i forget what it was even called yeah and it was doing okay right  but then fucking that video with you came along funny or die landlord and wiped that site off the  map my mom just sent me the landlord i'm like wow you're really on the cutting edge right you're  ahead of the curve not like it by the way oh she was against yeah she was against hey how much spanish 
[01:15:00]  can you because i'm kind of amazed that you did a movie where you're speaking spanish for real  uh yes well spanish is my first language oh my gosh yeah i finally i've all these movies in english i've  done phonetically so i'm finally just showing off the spanish yeah are you gonna do like spanish  radio interviews and stuff like i have no no no sadly i just uh i learned it for this movie you know  i mean i i took it really seriously because i didn't i didn't want the joke of the movie to be 
[01:15:30]  that i spoke spanish poorly right so i wanted to be that you you sat down you're like wait he's really  speaking it sounds sounds halfway decent so uh so yeah i had to work you know probably a month prior  to filming and then i would literally the the uh the translator would show up my house at five in the  morning we'd drive to the set and go over the lines and then drive home and start the next day's work  and were you having nightmares in spanish i totally was yeah yeah i was dreaming in spanish and uh all 
[01:16:00]  these things but uh but it was the only way i could kind of do it to to to make it authentic the movie's  really funny i thought i was at the south beach comedy festival oh okay so it was like that was  a great crowd actually yeah and what an interesting crowd because it's you know like the real telenovela  stars were there watching it it's intense is it what's it about it's uh um it's kind of it's like  telenovela meets a bad mexican spaghetti western and it's you know it's one of these heightened epic 
[01:16:30]  stories of you know two brothers trying to save the honor of their ranch that's you know fell on  hard times and diego luna's my brother of course yeah natural natural twins we've been bugged for  years when you guys could do a brother movie finally finally happened um and he comes back to help you  know he's he's gone off and as an international businessman and uh comes back to save the day but  it turns out he deals he deals he's a narco traficante oh no yes ooh yeah and my character 
[01:17:00]  does not like it you're bringing the family name down what are you doing so it's you know it's all  that all that kind of stuff did you shoot in mexico at all or no we shot in the mexico of southern  california chatsworth yeah simi valley simi valley yeah mexico's scary lately there's a lot of stuff  happening that's kind of dangerous i'm not familiar i don't know yeah all right frightening man  no spring break in mexico city no no no i feel like i'd be a good drug mule just for you know  in case anybody's simply for the room i could hold the balloons i just feel like i'm equipped she's 
[01:17:30]  the only one that can bring a hail of pop a fucking hail a veil of i don't want to pat myself on the  back but uh if you're looking for a balloon holder why not that work and will and i have worked  together one time and i thought we did very well together we did tough crowd sketch right oh gosh yes  where you were the worst name of all time oh that's right yeah legendary the name of sketch it  was uh will play the lawyer uh pete wait what was his name pete bentley i think that was colin 
[01:18:00]  gave awful names and he goes on purpose yeah and mine was marv gresto how do you remember marv  gresto that's because it was it was the greatest bad name ever when i read it in the  script i went bananas i was like this is the best thing i've ever read anybody right because colin  because it was such over-the-top nonsense and and he goes and my associate marv gresto here  he's got to say the whole name yeah yeah heat bentley yeah first name and last name 
[01:18:30]  colin's uh colin's hilarious he he gives you quite a bit of guff on twitter  occasionally oh yeah that's right yeah there was a whole right blaming you for things  all your illicit drug use obvious nonsense nobody believed it except the media asked him about it  he's like that's scary that you guys are asked like read by twitter yeah yeah if you did any research  and read 10 of colin's twitters you would know that he does nothing serious on on the uh but that's  what's so crazy you know everyone's just trolling for that stuff to find yeah pull a thing out and one 
[01:19:00]  tweet right here's the sound bite look at that right exactly what happened what happened explain  this yes right yeah louis ck's in some shit uh because of uh some of his um palin tweets that  he made yeah but he admittedly made those drunk from a plane i remember when he did that and then  he deleted them and he's like look uh the next morning he was like i might have written some 
[01:19:30]  shit last night i didn't mean any of it i was like trying to apologize plain drunk is a whole  different kind of tweeting and you're bored and now you have the ability to tweet and you might die  so you can say whatever you want yeah it's bad exactly it's all bad you're up your back's up against  the wall yeah in that you're almost compelled to tweet offensive horrid things yeah yeah are you in a  place where you like you were because you're you have a great career and you're well known and  like were you worried about saying things like this could be a problem like you find that you have to edit  yourself a little bit um i guess that's like the only downside of mainstream real fame is that you 
[01:20:00]  kind of have to watch it yeah i mean you yeah you you uh i definitely i mean especially with the whole  social media thing and you'll you know anything that you say in an interview could be carried  anywhere at any time and blah blah blah yeah did that concern you when that happened with colin  or you're more like oh what the fuck i didn't know about it i didn't know about it till someone  brought it up to me so i never i never it's all colin talks about i never would have known 
[01:20:30]  you see what colin was feeling i'm like well you're a colin first yeah  colin ferguson from jail  colin powell yeah was it colin powell i mean  are we talking my good buddy circle former secretary of state but i i loved you in that sketch  because we'll play it he was right after the elf movies and they're so successful and you come on with  an elf hat playing a lawyer and colin just brutalizes you for being a fucking wearing an elf hat in a  movie but i was like what a funny dude to come on and and do that and then most guys would have 
[01:21:00]  a movie of that big like oh no i'm not gonna no but you just came out with that elf hat and it was  really funny yeah you gotta kind of make fun of everything when you can yeah i i just felt that my  part in it was curious you care i mean that's the thing that's how he gets brought on stage you know  this next guy yes from the elf sketch on uh yes of course he played marv gresto  over here over here i just was watching the today's show this morning and there's a bunch 
[01:21:30]  of kids with marv gresto signs yeah yeah yeah what they want mg sometimes you know it's just a  fucking what was going on down the street they uh there was some british boy band was that what it  was all right all right you guys have to get out of here one direction is that their name  why am i pretending yeah yeah why am i pretending why am i pretending like i don't know of course it  was one direction we see your t-shirt underneath yeah i was driving up and uh there were just a  bunch of uh kids crossing the street yeah easy pickings 
[01:22:00]  have you done anything uh dramatic because like uh like or do you want to do anything because sandler  went into like he did i think spanglish and like sometimes for com and jim carrey has done some  stuff that's dramatic sometimes for comics it works sometimes it doesn't work i did i did i  had a thing come out last year um called everything must go uh uh that was totally dramatic which uh  was kind of an indie thing that uh uh a lot of people didn't see but uh that was great yeah i  loved it yeah it was and you're in the woody allen movie i mean you were funny i was yeah that was 
[01:22:30]  kind of yeah okay yeah yeah stranger than fiction's kind of dramatic yeah a little bit what are you  the most tim and eric that's uh that was a huge very dramatic role this movie's pretty dramatic oh  yeah it gets heated i cried mostly i had my own stuff going around it it was all about your sexing  yeah you don't know how awry things went you got plane drunk and went right to my screen  my movie when you hear like something if people like because do you read what critics right we always 
[01:23:00]  ask you because sometimes people on twitter yeah will tweet me and i'm like you  fucker i'm like why am i responding to this guy there's five people following him what do i care  for yeah i i um once again laziness but i don't really look at the the critique so much in a way  only because even the someone will send me one like hey pretty nice review and so and so and i'm like  okay great let me click on i'll read it and it inevitably starts with uh considering most of the  things he's done this one actually surprised me god damn it yeah and i'm like it can't even yeah 
[01:23:30]  it can't even be good the whole way right right right right so they're like uh don't even read the  good one yeah yeah yeah oh man this guy's usually a loud but he showed amazing restraint in this role  yeah he's not a total buffoon yeah it's like praising you by destroying everything you've ever done  yeah so yeah but you're not phased by it you're okay with that like you i i would be if i if i 
[01:24:00]  if i looked at yeah if i you know went through uh rotten tomatoes and and checked it all out i'd  probably be yeah i wouldn't leave my house probably but uh we were talking about i just stay away from  i just try to say how with twitter and and uh facebook and whatnot you they have accessibility to people  now that they never did in the past yeah we talk about what it would have been like yeah to tell  clark abel he sucked back in those days it was impossible yeah write a fucking letter it would 
[01:24:30]  never get to him it was like you know remember that scene in uh mommy dearest when they're signing  the pictures and it's like the help and the maids are stamping yes the signatures and putting them in  envelopes you never now it's like hey huge hollywood star that's grossed billions you suck yeah you can  basically text them with twitter they gave a direct text to you to write it's like you're  texting yeah people you never had access to absolutely do you tweet are you on i i tweeted for four days 
[01:25:00]  oh wow you had your full i had my i had it was a glorious four days  but but i got criticism on the tweets that came back it was like it was like that wasn't funny  a lot of fun dude this is not what twitter's for because i was like trying to promote some  charity thing i was doing they're like oh yeah that's not what twitter's for man come on here  make it count we're not here for it that's not why we're here it's amazing how some shithead  in his basement can actually tell him that's not what twitter's for when he's trying to promote a 
[01:25:30]  charity but it's like you know as performers we read it most times you don't let it get to you but  sometimes like this is something so irritating about it not that they don't like it but i would love if there  was a way and there's no way to to track the percentage of population that actually tweets  like it's probably numbers wise the small handful of people right yeah they're on their thing every  day that all right yeah i thought you were gonna say i wish there was a way and i was gonna to blow  their phone up in their hand the next time they try to tweet there probably is a way cia cia probably 
[01:26:00]  has that way yeah you make funny films look easy which is really it's a it's a like you make it look  like god that's that's an easy thing and it's certainly not you have this uh i don't even know  how to describe you that you're the fucking amazing deadpan yeah i think legendary deadpan would be the  way yeah just uh like how do you caricature all these you you play an amazing parody of things you  have a gift of showing how ridiculous things are yeah you know i i mean i think uh it's a lot of those 
[01:26:30]  movies i've gotten to do with mckay adam mckay uh you know we we met on at saturday night live and  we're just kind of like you know kindred spirits like we both just thought the same thing was funny  and the same approach and uh and i don't know that's kind of you know put that together and it  seems to work what are you the most proud of right now uh me or will no come on all right probably my  and lasting two minutes is not an accomplishment we want to hear some real gold yeah yeah yeah my 
[01:27:00]  antique gun collection okay yeah four thousand guns yeah wow that's a lot of them every day  they're my children they're my children wow that's great yeah it's really great yeah and uh what else  hey this movie got subtitles i hope so yeah it's if you can't read english this is not the movie for 
[01:27:30]  you yeah going into a subtitle movie sometimes you're like oh god and then two seconds into it  you're just well maybe more than two seconds you're just kind of like oh okay yeah yeah because i want  to see the picture but i want to read the words so i'm like ah you know what's interesting we've done  we've done a big college screening program with this movie and we wondered if that was going to be the  you know if kids were going to be like i don't want to read reading i can't text while i watch this  it hasn't come up once which is good really probably because they are texting they they 
[01:28:00]  they read stuff all the time with the texting so it's just right there in front of them any lols  no lols because it's spanish that would be what's the timing different uh because in a comic in  a comedy it's like you know yeah but was it different because people are reading it and laughing did you  you have to pace it all differently it didn't seem i don't know not i mean once you kind of  got the meaning of what you were saying it was it seemed to all flow the same way all right i'll  actually see this because uh i don't mean like i'll actually see it i'll actually i'm gonna throw you 
[01:28:30]  a bone well i mean it's it's really radically different and uh and it's you know we kind of make  fun of cliche views of mexico and cliche views of the u.s and all this stuff that's what's so  interesting watching it screened in miami it's like the people that are sort of being parodied  a little bit we're watching it oh but they were loving it oh they were spanish-speaking people down  there yeah they got a couple got a couple yeah mostly polish though miami is mostly a polish  totally polack town it's called casa de me how do you say this i mean i know but they don't 
[01:29:00]  casa de mi padre oh my god what's that mean that means uh god i have no idea that's a house of my  father our casa which is a ridiculous title this thing will be a house because it sounds like  house of my father it sounds very yeah very very manly and epic and huge well they're telling us  will have to go um definitely going to support this because the balls to learn spanish and do  a comedy in spanish you are a madman you can't instead of doing the same thing or something that 
[01:29:30]  was similar you just it was a 23 day fever dream believe me every day it felt like i wrapped an  entire movie my brain was like why did i agree to do this but but it paid off it's it's funny and  different you're doing god's work the lord thank you i couldn't i can't say that about myself but  but it's nice to hear yes so is amy though she took the plan b pill she's doing god yesterday she's  got life and death right in her womb there and she chose death i'm in the midst of having an abortion as 
[01:30:00]  we speak well okay so is our show this show has been described don't god motherfuckers chip's guided  tour through the ona archives continues with more unforgettable ona appearances by the world's top  comics coming up this show got me in trouble of course it did this is a very chipperson thanksgiving  what's that on the op and anthony channel  segment five 
[01:30:30]  colin quinn line tom popper tom popper's in studio and uh we talk about colin quinn making news headlines  or something because he was twittering that walter ferrell was stealing all of his material  i don't know maybe he was knitting sweaters or something i don't fucking know  the guys are going to review colin's ridiculous comments on twitter and colin calls up on the  telephone or something and gives his reaction to all the news coverage and uh i guess that like 
[01:31:00]  walter ferrell was doing something about the tweets and colin was on twitter or something and  then uh tom popper came segment five here it is the colin quinn tweets oh my god that guy  is the funniest fucking guy can we get him on the he's out of his mind did we try to get him on the  air he's big news today we should get him on the air can i ask where this is this from one of the 
[01:31:30]  papers yeah yeah what just one of the or or it's online oh soon to be in the papers yeah colin took  over twitter yesterday man he's he's the king yeah he was the guy colin quinn is the king he's the  guy of the twitter was he really yeah man somebody was making news and everything it's hilarious he's  making blog sites what huffington i guess yeah huffington uh went oh my god it went to the the  the mail online at the uk yes man what what dummies people are they are look at that headline i was 
[01:32:00]  into a lot of bad drug stuff he was he saw that will ferrell stole anchorman concept yeah colin quinn  jokes that will ferrell stole anchorman concept and takes drugs but they don't think it's a joke no  because because the media is stupid well he said it says jokes there so that's kind of that  that kind of this article came out later because yeah three paragraphs in it says however it appears 
[01:32:30]  they just failed to spot a good-natured bit of josh a good-natured bit of joshing don't you know  yes mess colin quinn comedian but this is late in the story because a lot of people were buying into  it for a while what jim's reading is from the hollywood reporter and the only oh god and the only  reason they know it was a joke is because colin got scared yeah colin started going off fuck  maybe this isn't a good idea maybe maybe i'll get in trouble look at the headline on huffington 
[01:33:00]  post yeah uh colin quinn rips will ferrell on twitter he stole anchorman has a drug problem  colin colin said i think he said on the show he was just that he said to cnn like you guys  are so dumb like like i'm scared that you don't get it right yeah some of the quotes read it jimmy  read it i couldn't believe that's what it just made me laugh fuck my halloween story who gives a  fuck this is way better i i just it hit me he goes uh ferrell recently received the mark twain award 
[01:33:30]  and it seems quinn was not a fan of that it says uh anybody see will ferrell at mark twain awards last  night great for him i guess like who takes that seriously i know who the fuck takes that seriously  no i'm happy for will we never really got along at snl because he took so many of my ideas but he  he continued that's his whole he took so many of my ideas and the whole thing when uh what's  the lauren michaels one i'm gonna get that's in two and and it's the one that made me laugh yeah  that one's hilarious he goes then quinn escalated his comments by saying will was into a lot of bad 
[01:34:00]  drug stuff and i don't know if he still is actually not true i happen to know he's still very much so  then quinn goes on to target lauren michaels target he goes uh the years at snl lauren really was  kind of messed up over various things and i was the shot caller he's saying he produced  snl during the years he was there and i was the shot call it like called the shot who the  fuck believes that apparently a lot of dumb people we are really oh then the last one goes uh he goes 
[01:34:30]  uh oh he said a couple hours later quinn seemed to apologize for his remarks but at the same time  threw in another zinger i feel bad about the whole will ferrell cup feel bad about the will ferrell  comments i'll never mention him again if he pays me my residuals for the whole anchorman concept  what business dumb motherfucker business insider why yeah the headline says colin quinn may have  just accused will ferrell of stealing the concept for anchorman from him i hope will ferrell gets it  he has to oh yeah he totally gets it he absolutely gets it yeah yeah that's how famous will ferrell is 
[01:35:00]  though like uh movie line uh colin quinn tweets that will ferrell had a bad drug problem  yeah will ferrell's gotta fucking read that and just laugh his ass off like you hope so colin yeah  you hope you hope you hope so i would think so it's you know what it is though it's a it's brilliant  because it first of all it's just funny on the on the surface it's funny shit to read but you dig down 
[01:35:30]  deeper and and that's pure colin is taking something like twitter and showing everyone how  ridiculous it is and how easy it is to take something that is social networking and twist  things around and actually make people believe anything and everybody wants to be first to  print it so right colin quinn is saying that you know friends will ferrell is a drug addict and he  stole anchorman from me they're like fuck we got to get this up on our blog and they're reporters but  nobody does any homework they just get these tweets sent to them they don't scroll back they 
[01:36:00]  don't care insane they're copy pasters they're not reporters anymore they're copy pasters that's  exactly what you just said sam yeah yeah they don't they they don't do any uh background checking at  all they just go with it because they would they need to be the first one un-fucking-believable  they just don't care they don't uh oh you know how you know the copy and paste when we we mentioned  patrice bob kelly is the one who actually said and it doesn't matter like bob kelly said it and  but they were saying jim norton said and they were using bob kelly now i know some guys don't 
[01:36:30]  know bob's voice so they couldn't tell the difference between bobby and i and i get that  but when every when you see one printed and then you see bop bop bop all these other ones printed it  was like all you're doing is reporting what they reported like you're doing no homework yourself  you're doing no original work it's like fucking lazy man happens all the fucking time they're just  lazy what else they have to do during the day they're not doing a radio show all you have to do is  you know uh fact check like they can't listen to audio themselves first of all here it's two 
[01:37:00]  different voices but then just do their own homework and maybe come up with an angle themselves or use  their own words now terrible copy paste get it up on the site boom move on exactly it unbelievable  how gullible and just yeah a complete lack of reporting well well colin said it uh and there's  there's no accountability which you know that's the biggest part like does it matter is somebody gonna  get oh one of these new news agencies uh gonna get in trouble or is the the reporter uh gonna 
[01:37:30]  catch heat from whatever superior they have because they printed something that wasn't true or or real  or printed it like it was true no because everyone accepts the fact that if it's written down even if  it's on twitter it must be true well the stakes are too high so they're all in on it steaks we got  the stakes back there stakes are too high they're doing gambling all the time just hoping you know  what they just read is true as they put it on their site yep uh sleeves has a colin quinn song 
[01:38:00]  that's what coke logic is telling me no one understands him  hair like he combed it with an m80 for la la la jaymore does his voice for la la la got skinny little  legs for la la la breakable cancer fingers la la la nobody likes him for la la la la he's a dirty  fucking rosacea irish face you can so break his fingers easily oh god dude like by looking at them 
[01:38:30]  well uh you know uh we got to hear the sleeves colin quinn song oh who wouldn't want to the radio  ghost himself use radio ghost what does that mean chase some fucking leaves face down  like see the last shot and that is him just going down the river face first yeah you're leading the  leaves by dead example uh you got it yeah let's hear it oh god here it is it's buffering by the 
[01:39:00]  way someone's fired is that really it's buffering  i mean we all have am i right completely right  terrible thing that can never be taken back this can never be taken back colin ever it's  ugly stuff stuff that i keep saying never again then what do you do now you wake up 
[01:39:30]  and what do you find upon waking oh my god  what is this he's using me on this one is this and i'm a big fan of sleeves but i'm exposing him  anybody to see will ferrum at mark twain awards last night great for him 
[01:40:00]  not just you know what is he doing what is this  i have no idea what that was 
[01:40:30]  reading tweets i was actually liking that one  really by the way colin tweeted i guess at the end to all media etc will ferrell was not on drugs  at snl i never even saw him smoke a joint is this what it's come to with three question marks  see i guess he had to because it's like you know he's kidding me as one but it's a great way to end  the whole thing yeah it's like he was getting scared it exposes everybody because will would have  fun with that he was getting scared he got some pressure for some from some people behind the 
[01:41:00]  scenes i'm assuming somebody just said dude you just got to say you're joking yeah it's a great  way to end it because it's not like hey i apologize for this and it's like look hey idiots do you even  fucking get this i want to see more headlines sam uh i was just reading some of his other tweets  that didn't make the article oh really right after he tweeted the lord michaels thing he tweeted  there's things going on right now secret things behind the scenes type stuff that i think will  catapult me into the best of the best and uh yeah right on yeah feel shit feel bad about the will 
[01:41:30]  ferrell comments i'll never mention him again if he pays me my my residuals for the whole anchorman  concept he stole he stole the concept he wants his residuals i don't like the fact that sam read one  that i just read yes and and did the same thing i did with the capital letters put emphasis on it  oh the whole like that i don't like that yeah and he repeated what i said already oh boy what's 
[01:42:00]  going on with you today roberts oh no yeah you would be on beretta's shoulder  he's getting very antsy sitting there i see that you know who doesn't do that to him i see that  mother i'm sure he'll be doing antsy's jokes soon too oh and jimsy's wait a minute yeah you gotta read  the different tweets sam you're reading the same thing detective monahan heard that  ah quince gee i don't know she's only five come on they look so nice when they're that young 
[01:42:30]  i'm the colonel i don't touch him i just look at him look  oh shit so that's a that's a big one today we got to get calling on i didn't have no i someone i saw  on twitter said something yeah i just hadn't seen call's tweets i wasn't looking at twitter  yesterday yeah god damn yeah it's uh it was just it was hilarious it's the perfect way to expose  twitter and expose these fucking idiots whether it's just a another guy tweeting that's sitting 
[01:43:00]  around and can't fucking understand sarcasm or these dumb ass fucking people in the media there's  a panic going on though yeah because a lot of a lot of people on twitter are getting the story  before mainstream news they're getting it out there first so now what do you do you got to  gamble but it's also a mixture of real journalism well not even real like mainstream media and just  a blogger all of a sudden it becomes the same fucking thing but break it down colin's tweeting 
[01:43:30]  this crazy shit what do you do do you try to call his people knowing that everyone else is reading  twitter and you know someone is going to grab it and go with it so then you think to yourself well colin  yeah isn't known to be this crazy uh off the top off the cuff type of guy he isn't in in the  mainstream yeah so they go fuck i let's we have to go with this you know yeah that's what's going on  there i don't have time to confirm it no because someone else is going to grab it someone else is  just going to run with it anyway so i might as well right what what is that one no just when you google 
[01:44:00]  news him once the articles about uh will ferrell stopped the last twitter fiasco that he started  about gaddafi is he just he's brilliant and if you did a second of research you would understand  that colin is never serious on twitter ever we got colin oh good yeah and we got bill burns studio  uh colin quinn everyone colin hey guys how's it going hey buddy hey colin you sound like a  colin you sound like a beaten man after yesterday just chill and listen to some music oh 
[01:44:30]  what's he doing he's listening to beaver he's a believer you love the babes i'm a believer  what's up guys uh bill you heard about colin he's in deep trouble today oh i heard all about it yeah  it was trending colin quinn was trending yesterday on twitter yes he was it's scary how stupid they are  isn't it it's ridiculous it really is like you you continually expose these idiots for for what 
[01:45:00]  they are just like knee-jerk no research whatsoever all you would have to do is search colin  colin quinn's twitter and you'd realize he's done this before and it's it's documented why take  everything he says on twitter as fact and print it like oh my god he's he's accusing means it because  he means it that's did you mean it oh okay i i'm my mistake i started out the morning on a positive 
[01:45:30]  note talking about the uh potential intriguing employment stuff going on with me and then uh  i just mentioned that will farrell stole like a man from me yeah of course then of course i made  up the drug thing so that becomes a big thing the drug thing and they ran with it but did they ran with  it did you hear from anybody because that's like uh because yeah that's why i had to say hey man you  know first my manager was like hey you know i told you troll but then i was like nah man  that's what we always do too we're like nah man this is good right it's good 
[01:46:00]  we know so did you send out a tweet that finally said it was a joke you  fucking retards i want to hear uh leading up to that so then the manager is going whoa colin and  you're like come on man this is all right and then what happened my manager answers the phone to his  credit yeah they go that we asked one site goes we asked colin quinn's manager for a response with  a column series and he just laughed and laughed and hung up so that was that what your manager's 
[01:46:30]  doing laughing and hanging up that's what you want your manager yeah yeah when all hell's breaking  loose that's what you want from your manager he goes click yeah i actually like that just treat  them like the idiots that they are yeah right don't dignify it with a response so you uh did will call  you or his manager because what happened where you finally had to go like look you morons i was  joking yeah because i know well and i know his manager's master's like hey man you know i'm getting  like 50 calls can you please say something i am saying something it was just about the drug yeah of 
[01:47:00]  course yeah i go what is i said tell will i'm sorry he goes he's on a plane he doesn't even know  any of this is going on yeah like well what's your drug problem you know yeah you know what you  should have said call you should have said will he be mad that's that's that's a good one is that  chip of course it's hard to tell chip from jim these days yeah i can't even argue with him 
[01:47:30]  so so will farrell have you heard from will farrell at all no no i don't but really you know what's  he gonna say you know well i don't know that's just it was my whole thing you know so you're still  not you're not letting that not letting that one go are you no i was like hey i'm ron burgundy  i would come in the office joking around like that same name and everything wow my favorite  tweet was when you said that like lauren was falling apart and you were calling the shots  calling the shots yeah people were tweeting back at me like you won't call it you know but of course 
[01:48:00]  even in a couple of media things you know colin quinn claims that he was you know running snl secretly  you know yeah what dummies it's just stupid that was the tweet that got them that i was calling the  shots over there yeah but it's amazing how stupid they are like they literally just like we said  before copy and paste what some other person has written or a blogger and they don't do any homework  or read the context in which these tweets are written no did uh thanks for adding to that 
[01:48:30]  that was your turn colin yeah exactly it was your turn i fucking hit that was the setup i hit the  ball over the net what it's hard when you're at the studio yeah it is you feel like i feel like  everybody's sitting there after each silence going okay let's get off this goddamn phone now  no there's a few people have rolled their eyes but that's about it really do you know colin could do  that that again today and people will still just think he's he's for real yeah they're they're idiots 
[01:49:00]  they do no research whatsoever how many uh how many followers do you lose well at first i lost 800  at the beginning but then i get a couple more now i'm back i'm almost even to where i started yesterday  yeah like twitter blackjack yeah i'm about even his twitter stats is like a roller coaster you're insane  yeah every time you're finally over 100 000 but every time you got close you decide to blow it up and  lose but this is how twitter this is exactly how twitter should be used like anyone who takes it 
[01:49:30]  seriously is an asshole i mean colin is mocking the whole thing i love it the best is when like some  guy like attacks you know like some guy attacks for me and they start attacking poor idiot that doesn't  get it like they just ruined them like some girl yesterday was like sounds like somebody's jealous you  know yeah spreading negativity makes you look like a fool and guys are like shut up you dirty hole 
[01:50:00]  yeah they uh yeah they they react to a spitball with a howitzer  one guy just writes back aids aids aids aids aids  that's probably one of ours yeah probably i think i'd be a point  i love those people try to get philosophical and teach you a life lesson through a tweet in 140  characters you're gonna get enlightened you know as confucius always said  shut the fuck you think confucius used the word the letters you are for your and yeah 
[01:50:30]  when he was trying to write you well just  that's very funny jimmy  oh that's it look at look at the big uh the big book uh out there from chris matthews  yes scumbag who wouldn't come on our show about jfk it's really it's really this is we need another  book about jfk because we don't know every fucking thing they're part did you know he  fucked maryland why wouldn't he come on your show because he's a douchebag that's why he  he was booked and then you know a dumb excuse uh was had which means he found out i guess who we 
[01:51:00]  are or something yeah his publicist probably listened to the show i was like oh you don't  want to go on the show on that show yeah they'll actually read your book and then tell you what they  think of it and they don't care about your influence in this business it's a look inside his  childhood yeah gives a shit gives a privileged childhood what's that he's from philly no he  means jfk oh i read a book about when i was a little kid i know by the way i know i'm going 
[01:51:30]  to get disconnected by you are for this when i was a little kid because you guys going to be signaling  yeah no no i read a book about okay and it really was quite an impacting book it was like he used to  eat toast he had a fight he had a piece of toast and he got on the bus and he had a fight with the  kid who turned out to be his best friend that's always a nice way to start things off humorous  anecdote yeah i wish you were here yesterday we could have chris matthews and done an hour on that  so the toast incident chris did you write about that go go hey you um use toast as a metaphor for 
[01:52:00]  what jfk was yeah like he was wearing toast on his head and it got shut off a bunch of jelly  jelly on it someone threw butter from the grassy knoll well the only the only uncalled for thing  yesterday was in the middle of each twitter war and all these media things was once in a while  somebody would just trash and go and by the way voss never gets off unscathed but by the way  call this is why this is why uh i told you you should have uh you should have gone on pierce morgan 
[01:52:30]  without warning that producer you should have just on tv just said it's a it's a joke you should  have shamed them you were too nice that was for the other one i know i know but i'm saying you should  have shamed them publicly how about the fact that i get off the end train i had to go do it uh like  a little thing oh don't call it that thing oh i guess the end one knows that's the b of course 
[01:53:00]  about 11 30 at night i come up my station there's a picture of bill burr on the middle of the car  i would love to see in that picture your face did you just look down at your phone real quick and not  look up until you're on 56th so i just took my phone and i made somebody take a picture of my face  over his i don't think we could believe anything colin says anymore no a confirmed twitter liar but 
[01:53:30]  lies just a phony baloney yep yeah mr quinn yeah you better go back to tweeting or something right  yeah yeah you know colin you could have been uplifting with your fame instead of spreading all that  negativity too right you're right like uh one of the kardashians that's why they have 10 many followers  because they put in positivity yeah what was your i started the morning on some positive notes i was  saying really good stuff what was your favorite headline you read yesterday about yourself um i  don't know i didn't really know what is it colin quinn slams let's see what this one says 
[01:54:00]  colin quinn tweets that will ferrell had a bad drug problem then they just go over my timeline  and they they even have my early date like in the early part of the day yeah i was tweeting like  feeling a lot of good things going on in the world right now for me a lot of positivity and they  like tweetos too they don't even explain like why why you said that exactly like a bunch of idiots  can they look at you and realize you couldn't feel good no they know he's joking around they're just  taking it seriously so all the they're pandering to the morons something to talk about yeah yeah

[02:22:00]  steven wright was the first one to break out and go to la and be on uh carson right at the time yeah  1982 documentary was when stand-up stood out yeah it's a great documentary because all these guys  were kind of doing their thing in boston and he was the first one to get the call and then after that  they kind of followed steven wright i don't know why i don't know why that all those people i don't  know why that happened like that yeah some kind of magic it was just like well who'd you come up  with jimmy mentioned a bunch of them it was dennis leary paula poundstone paula poundstone

[02:23:30]  especially then it was it was surreal you know surrealistic i mean i wanted to go on there like  that's why i wanted to do this to maybe someday go on there yeah when i got it in my head when i was 15  so then like doing in the clubs and then like peter la salle came to boston he was the  producer of the tonight show he came to look at colleges for his kids oh jesus god wow in the  summer of 82 and then someone wrote an article there was a club called the dingho comedy club 
[02:24:00]  was half chinese restaurant half that was in the yeah right someone wrote about an article about it  and went in the la times so he had that club in his head so then months i don't know how much long  later eight months later when he came to boston he remembered the club and he wanted to go into  it's in the club and then he saw he saw me in there and three weeks later i was on the tonight  show oh wow it was like it was like a fairy yeah did you know he was there yeah oh you knew he was  in the road so you did just tomorrow good and that was when there was only three maybe four channels 
[02:24:30]  yeah yeah yeah you know what i mean now you're on tv it's cool and all but back then 1982 going on  carson oh yeah a lot of people were watching you that means overnight success obviously you go from  no one knowing your name to everyone the next day yeah that changed my career my whole life  sure what happened like in just like eight minutes like one lousy eight minutes that can happen now  because it's hard it's a lot harder what happened after you did you did your tonight show the next day 
[02:25:00]  was it like wherever you wanted people had seen you on the show or how did they meet kind of immediately  back then that would things were just different yeah especially if he like called you over or if he  acknowledged that he enjoyed you it was a couple of days later i was in dodger stadium watching a game  the first time i ever got recognized it was like three days oh really yeah it was pretty yeah it's a  weird feeling right yeah it is and and then he's like get the hell away from me first time you're  ever recognizing you just hey come on i'm trying to have a moment here no you talk to people when they 
[02:25:30]  first start recognizing you you really talk to them like oh thanks a lot were you home with your friends  you know you ask a lot of questions stay a while yeah where are you going two years later you're  like oh why don't you just throw yourself into a fucking ditch you saw the show drop dead thanks  i'm fucking trying to eat  so we've heard too uh too true though yeah after a while it gets a little you know 
[02:26:00]  that's what we were talking about yeah we were talking about you know just even something like  shaking hands we would do these events and uh and you realize by the 50th person you just oh how  many how many clammy fish belly hands can you can you shake without and then you have that horrifying  moment where you get done and you're just tired and you don't realize like you're eating a slice of  pizza and went shit i didn't watch yeah i ate it already hope no one had hep yeah yeah you just 
[02:26:30]  don't know what the hell you're throwing in your mouth but we love them we love it oh yeah every  single one of them i stopped touching my face while i'm working out because i realized like i'm on the  elliptical and it's like you must be able to touch your face all the time  i'm implying you don't work out yeah you're correct all right but no man you start your  hands are on the thing and you're like i didn't even wipe this down first i'm fucking like you know 
[02:27:00]  touching my nose or like scratching everything right yeah this does make you a little germy kind  of you kind of get a little because you deal with too many people i wish i didn't have it like  i wish i wasn't aware like of it is it like an issue uh like a big issue with you or is it just kind  of a i'd rather not i'd rather not you know it just creeps in over the years yeah those tv show  when they investigate murders and stuff and they're going through the room with the light the blue  light and yeah all the scum is all over well this isn't scum but it's not his scum someone else this 
[02:27:30]  wasn't involved in the murder but look at this frank and then it's like you know little tiny things and  it's like well wait a minute that's you know that seeps in these shows seep in so you know  you start thinking about it yeah now you obviously stay at a lot of hotels so that's  is that a nightmare for you it's not a nightmare but your brain my brain has little like  things so i can function it's yeah you can't think of everything you were thinking of the 
[02:28:00]  equipment i think of the exercise equipment i ride an exercise bike so i'm super aware of when i'm in  there doing that but the hotel room i got a block you know part of my brain they shut down the fuse  is like do not do not think of this this this this this this otherwise you can't go anywhere you  mean you don't roll up in the bedspread as soon as you get to your room  you know they don't wash those things ever oh the bedspreads oh yes because when they do why would 
[02:28:30]  they wash those yeah they do the sheets and stuff yeah but the bedspread i bet you they have a  protocol once a year maybe yeah i don't touch the bedspread they do a bedspread run steven's head is  in his hands right now sorry i don't know when they when they investigated mike tyson remember that  when he introduced the rape yeah they uh went in and uh i can't believe i know this it's all right  they found sperm on the bedspread but it wasn't his so then that sticks my so from then on bedspreads 
[02:29:00]  would like as soon as i go in i just yeah peel it off not that it's gonna do anything you sperm's  not gonna hurt you is it chum probably not no i hate when i get it in the eye because that does  give you a pink eye believe me i showed up a tough crowd once my eye was red and someone's like what  happened like if you want a real answer i'll give it to you you're not gonna like it  yeah that's why they call me the distance kid distance what gets me in hotels is the uh the tv 
[02:29:30]  remote because i know personally you know i've had all this i've had you know relations in a hotel room  and then you just kind of roll over and you were you know your hands were everywhere first  thing you do is grab the remote you're changing channels that's the that's the worst of the whole  room right that's because everyone's touching it known thing it's not my opinion that's the  worst thing in the yeah the worst thing that remote probably lights up like a peter maxx painting  when they put the black uh black light on it do you know i hotels they also clean a lot too like 
[02:30:00]  but that's only the areas you're gonna like you know the faucet they do more clean than probably  most people too because every day there's could be made in their washing but i'm like steven i block  it out like because it could drive you crazy but then yeah you just can't think about it i  fucked so many times without a rubber what can i possibly do that i don't have already i think  we're making our guest a little uncomfortable no he's looking around the room he's like he deals  with this it's great because yeah you have you have to deal with it uh and you're you're able to which 
[02:30:30]  is good it's not like you know well i stay in a trailer or i have a truck bring me places like john  madden have it scrubbed down wherever you go you're able to reach it for tissues why don't we  move on it subconscious i don't even know why i was just let me hold this let me hold this i might  need it but it's an interesting psychology because i we all have it to a certain degree yes like it's  where your line is yeah like howie howie mandel is like that's crazy he's the go-to guy like well 
[02:31:00]  i'm not as bad as how like everyone like when you're drinking and drugging you're like well i'm not as  bad as that guy howie is the germ guy it's driving him nuts yeah he's having a tough time with that  last time i was in here he was telling us he was having a tough time with that and he's open about  it and he talks about it it's just it's hard because once you get something in your head man  it's fucking you know who got me started on it rich voss oh rich voss got me started i don't shake hands  and i shake hands like no one wants to shake your hand rich but he has horrible little rock hands 
[02:31:30]  he doesn't want you in interaction at all right i didn't realize with rich it's obviously it's it's a long  line of rapes you can't touch this guy yeah i'm sure he's suffered many so you should touch him  so you should touch him he just gets all like he gets really uncomfortable that's great what do you  mean he has rock hands oh his hands are like he has small gargoyle hands they're really unpleasant  visually and and they feel well terrible they're not nice hands to touch he plays a lot of golf so he  has those really thick over the top calluses they're the hands of a dummy like if you've ever seen 
[02:32:00]  a dump what a dummy's hand should feel like they're vossy hands of a working man oh absolutely i wouldn't i  i wouldn't be happy if he wouldn't find out about it i would like people to twitter voss he has dumb  i told him his hands are like turtle feet but what can he he can't what can he do about it nothing  he has to lose it he's doomed yeah oh yeah do you know voss he's oh he's a comedian he's a he's a  buddy of mine okay rich is right now gonna she knows me we met one time please shut up no one remembers  you hey how was it uh winning an oscar i think steven wright might be the first uh oscar winner in our 
[02:32:30]  studio oh really i'm trying to think you might be right i think i think you're the only one sir  and we've been doing this a long time 1989 right dreyfuss never won one he was in yeah xm i remember  yeah richard was did he ever win though i don't know i love him yeah isn't he great but do you  you have an oscar right yeah yeah where's that oscar right now it's uh on a table in my house in my  living room nice was that 89 that was way after it was eight after that because i remember barry 
[02:33:00]  katz that short film 1989 i was okay barry katz told me that for some reason yeah well that was  incredibly weird because we made a film for hbo we didn't even make it to go in the theater yeah yeah  i mean we went in there to see if we could make a half an hour movie and they said yeah and then we  wrote it and we me and my friend mike armstrong wrote it and dean paraso directed it and then we gave  it to them and they liked it a lot so then they played it in the theaters and if it plays in new 
[02:33:30]  york or la then it's eligible and then it was nominated and then it won we didn't even make it  we made it you know it was like throwing a dart like this this thing was called the appointments of  dennis jennings it was like throwing that to hbo like and a big gust of wind blew it 50 miles to the  the right and it went and where did it go where oh it's stuck in over there oh that oscar that is  amazing yeah it really is it's realistic how long of the film is it 20 30 minutes and when they call 
[02:34:00]  the name do you just go like what i can't i won this just weird like it's happening but it's not  happening yeah and me and the director went up and i said this is for the short film category and  we're really glad now that we cut out the other 60 minutes there's your steven right there perfect  man that must have gotten a massive laugh that is very funny dreyfuss did win for goodbye girl 
[02:34:30]  the goodbye girl 1977 i would have thought it was for mr holland's opus nominated and someone's  saying sinbad won an oscar get the fuck out of here what did he win someone just fucking around  they have to be have you guys known each other before the show uh yeah kind of i used to come on  a show i was in construction for many years i never did radio or anything and then uh uh i was doing  song parodies and stuff so i sent a few it was during the oj simpson thing yeah we didn't really  sent it into his show and yeah he played it the fans liked it he invited me in to do it live and then 
[02:35:00]  we just started talking and it was like oh now we just seven 17 years we're up to wow and then we went  up to massachusetts to radio at uh waaf and uh i just threw my tools out the window my sheet metal  worker tools out the window and uh thought i could always find new ones if i fall on my ass it is  weird we're doing a radio show right because oj killed those people though that's the only reason  we got together if oj didn't commit those heinous crimes that is that is the truth i don't know if  we would have met i'd still be in an attic because oj had to kill the people that made him go i'm gonna 
[02:35:30]  write a song about it i heard about the song i played the song and that's why we're we're doing  radio do you know if you ever meet oj's if you ever meet denise denise uh nicole's sister you should  say do i have a story for you but think lemons and lemonade yes but how else do you think of the  good that came of it we wouldn't have met it was just one of those chance things wow and 17 years  later we're still uh was your show in a year oh no this goes back long island long island then you 
[02:36:00]  went together as a boss yeah how long did you go to the boss three years about and then we got  fired we were the mayor guys saying the mayor menino died in a car accident trouble yeah we were those  guys oh we were we were we were wacky look out yeah we're those guys and then uh they rewarded  they run us out of town they rewarded us by giving us a higher paying job right here back in new york  city so hey that wasn't good enough for us so we fucked that gig up yeah we fucked that up and then  got a better job i i came on around i came to him about 2000 here's how when they fucked the gig 
[02:36:30]  up in here no this was at uh w w it's uh it was an afternoon drive show yeah on the regular standard  radio i was paying 300 a month to live with a comedian jim florentine in jersey and his girlfriend  so it's a 900 rent split three ways i say fuck it i'm gonna move into new york so i'm on the radio every  day i pick up a rent that is seven times higher seven times higher a 2200 a month rent 
[02:37:00]  and five months later we're off the air i have a two-year lease  you've never seen a panic-stricken person whoops 27 uh yeah five months later when you were  blowing colin i couldn't have thrown you guys under the bus faster for colin  and when tough crowd came around i was like oh fuck those guys come on  okay come on reservoir dogs it's so cool too every time i watch you because we've had mad yeah yeah  you're part of like a real an amazing cult it's nice i love to see comedians in places like that 
[02:37:30]  it kind of gives you hope yeah yeah that is uh it's it's you don't realize how huge of a part that is  in that movie to set the mood you know it's steelers wheel you announcing steelers wheel  i still think when i hear that song i think of that that's i think i think everyone thinks how  could he not at this point and and uh i i'm glad you're here because i could ask whose idea was it  to say behemoth well i i did like one or two takes of each thing and i stumbled on that one and i did it 
[02:38:00]  again to make it right but he chose that one it's so funny behemoth you know and the way it goes  behemoth it gets me every time it works yeah i was lucky to get in there because the woman who  edited his movie sally menke she edited the dennis jennings movie that i made so the whole movie was  almost done like reservoir dogs was almost done but he didn't have the voice he knew the guy was 
[02:38:30]  going to be on the radio but he didn't have the voice and she suggested me and he liked the idea so  that's so what you're saying is you're the luckiest guy in show business pretty much what i'm getting  a lot of lucky stories  that's true it's another dart being thrown somewhere just say because i'm talented  enough of the lucky story he's had some amazing really good luck oh yeah he has  obviously i have really you're a brilliant that too i know now you're a brilliant comic steven right  yeah but a lot of it is right place right time too it's like it's nice again that's with anything 
[02:39:00]  man of course yeah but you got to be able to back it up you know i've seen people get lucky and then  it's like oh yeah they suck that's right but stand up is such like i i watched recently with with the  hbo uh what was the young comedians thing you did it was i think it catch in new york they filmed  yeah when the owen king is the host the host yeah wow yeah that was in 82 82 i remember steven from  that um i used to watch those when i was younger all the time and to see a stand up being so opposite  with everybody else because everybody especially in the early 80s was 
[02:39:30]  fucking high energy and crazy and then to come out and just silence people and make them listen  to that that was really a ballsy yeah yeah you gotta have a lot of confidence in your material when  you're you're pretty much just monotone and quiet i can yeah but i didn't know how to do it another way  you know it wasn't yeah well i'll do this you know it was just my only i know what you're saying  i know your angle on that but i didn't know how to do it any other way and when in the early days when 
[02:40:00]  there was a lot of talking in the audience hecklers and stuff noise you know when the  place is noisy in the club i would just talk softer and it would quiet the room down because i was  talking even lower than i normally did because i didn't know how to like say wisecrack things  interact like a you know like a guy off like lenny would right you know what i mean yeah just bash a  heckler or something i didn't know what to do that's a great idea though because that obviously would  force the people to shut the hell up and it worked i don't know why it worked they could have just 
[02:40:30]  talked even more or ignored me yeah somehow it you know i stumbled on it by accident you know how you  learn things by accident yeah yeah like little tiny things happen you go and your brain goes well wait  a minute i got to remember that right for future reference and this whole thing starts piling up you  know because you're your own teacher you're your student you're a student and your own teacher yeah so so that  was like i stumbled on that okay now when that happens again i'll talk softer and it's weird so 
[02:41:00]  you see alternative comics to me they i've always thought they all want to be steven in that but they  miss what he does which is has great jokes like a lot of them are funny but they want a deadpan and they  want to be just they want their words concentrated on right they forget that you have to have funny stuff  to say too and not all comics but i mean that when i watched that movement happening i was like they're  all trying to be steven and they don't even know it but you would go up there not one ounce of  muscling jokes no bullshit just stand there and quietly and fucking murder and it was like there's 
[02:41:30]  something he makes it look like wow that's gonna be easy yeah and then you try it it's like holy  shit they won't stop talking where it's hard where did that where did that come from growing up i i guess  did you just observe a lot of stuff and realize wow that's pretty strange i i could twist that around  and make it funny i didn't really write any jokes to it i went i wanted to do this had in my head  since i was 15 and then i went to school and college and everything went out west to colorado  and california and i came back my brother was getting married i came back in 79 because he was 
[02:42:00]  getting married when i came back i learned heard of the comedy connection i didn't even know there was a  club in boston and then i thought well i've had this in my head since i was 15 i better go down to  the club this is amazing i don't have to go to new york or la i you know i i don't think i had the  the strength as a 23 year old i wouldn't even i didn't have the balls to move to new to leave  yeah i didn't have really a plan it was a fantasy to do this right well when i came back and i heard 
[02:42:30]  the club was right there i was like well i gotta go down and check it out so i went down and i watched  a show and i learned that the open mic night was in two weeks so during no it was every week but i  decided i would go in two weeks and then i wrote stuff during that time to go back but i had never  written any jokes before that really did you get laughs the first night i i was on for about three  minutes and i and they laughed at about half of it you know like in and out and i mean i was so 
[02:43:00]  nervous that's one reason i had straight i have a you know i have a straight face kind of anyway but  i was as pitch pitch you know just like oh my so i was like this like trying to say the remember the  joke say the right joke what's next just like if someone had a gun on me off stage if you make a  mistake you blow your head off i don't know and then it just worked i mean i that's how i talk anyway 
[02:43:30]  yeah yeah but uh yeah no so mike you know mike mcdonald comedian i know the name i don't know him  well he was doing it already i went to emerson with him and uh leary was at emerson too and mario  canton was oh wow okay oh yeah another boston guy i'm going to see him tonight in carolines  oh yeah yeah and uh he's amazing yeah what a mind he has geez so uh i thought oh mike i came off and 
[02:44:00]  i was very disappointed i didn't they didn't i thought oh that was horrible they didn't laugh  at everything but out of innocence yeah of not knowing and mike said look you never even did it  ever in your life and they laughed at half of it so rip out the stuff that didn't work and write other  stuff and put it in and then come back and so when i left from him saying that to me i said that  this many times over the years i left the place seeing it like a positive experience rather than 
[02:44:30]  like oh that sucked right well i leave the place and i'm going i can't believe it they laughed at  something i made up i can't i can't i absolutely can't believe it and then then i kept going back so  he had a big impact on me that one guy being nice to you it is weird how that can make or break you  yeah if somebody else came up but you suck stories about that don't quit your day job yeah  great thanks but another support another comedian it is nice when somebody in the business because 
[02:45:00]  you know people can be very cutthroat but sees a guy who's young and it's like hey he's funny and  and just tells you something they don't people don't realize what an impact that really i always try to  be nice to younger comics um because i remember like when people were nice to me and talk to me like  i meant something it's fun it was an incredibly if they would have if they would have let me know i was not  going to be in their club i never would have come back if they would have let me know like you're not  going to be a part of this ever but they were very welcoming most comics were pretty good did you did  you love it like right from that first time even though you were nervous when you got off stage were  you just thinking i want to do that again i knew i wanted to do it again i don't know if i said i i guess 
[02:45:30]  i love it i didn't think that i loved it i loved the idea that i was 23 and i had it in my head to  be a comedian since i was 15 so what is that like eight years eight years i thought eight years it  was in a concept and then that night they laughed at a joke i made up so that was like a turning  point that was like jeez where where do you think you were headed if it wasn't for comedy  uh well i went i went to emerson uh for mass communication doing radio okay i thought if i 
[02:46:00]  mean i thought i could be funny on the radio i would somehow get to stand up but i didn't know  whoops uh he's got we're uh then he has to leave you're a busy guy today suppose i mean the stanley  cup is a block away from here and i hear you're going to be uh going down there and hoisting it  or something no i'm not hoisting what happened i'm not gonna hoist this thing i'd like to hang 
[02:46:30]  i'd like to hang out longer oh good well yes yeah your guys are telling absolutely oh no problem  then but i go in to get this coffee on the way here and the woman comes in with a  bruins hat and she sees my red socks head oh did you see the series oh i'm gonna see the stanley cup  what i'm gonna see the stanley cup it's on 47th and 6th she said that's why i'm here so then i'm  thinking oh my god you can do the show and then go down there and see it's unbelievable 
[02:47:00]  and i was telling pam that like this this wouldn't have happened and i live in carlisle  massachusetts if i went in dunkin donuts you know this morning to get a coffee oh the stanley cup's  gonna be down the street with three of the players three of the players are going to be there too  i had another lucky  you're not brilliant sir oh my god you know the funny thing is they usually bring the stanley 
[02:47:30]  cup in here but this year for some reason they passed us by man usually we've had we have it  right in front of you you could have done both of that at the same time but you're right the good  the good luck of just watching after all those years just tuning in a few months ago and then he  happens to show up where the cup is i'm gonna follow him down because i guarantee you spielberg  is there somebody somebody is there the carson thing because the guy decided that his kids 
[02:48:00]  wanted to go to college in boston and he had to go to the chinese joint that is  this is creepy steven like you're adding it up later i'll go to kill myself and there'll be no  bullet in the chamber hey another lucky look at that well the first time you have bad luck it's  going to be really bad luck i hear it's a chara thomas and bergeron are going to be there wow  a block away from here is it a zoo down there does anyone know i mean you'll go to the front of the  line yeah what is it a bar is it a bar they're doing oh it's the nhl store oh i forgot about that 
[02:48:30]  that's that's a block away from here what was your first bad like really awful stage experience  there must have been one that you were like because we usually have that one where we're  like am i in the right fucking job here well well like a couple years in uh during the early 80s  they would have the comedy clubs but then outside in the suburbs like 40 minutes away or something  they'd have one comedy one night but it wasn't a comedy club yeah and and there was a place in  the lemonster mass called scampi's and it was like a nightclub thing and that was the worst 
[02:49:00]  thing ever because one thing i learned was that the audience should know there's going to be a show  oh yeah yeah because it was music it was like disco music people dancing and maybe a little sign  like this big off to the side where you come in no one sees it and then all of a sudden the guy  they shut the music off and the lights stop and a guy walks out with a microphone and puts it on the 
[02:49:30]  dance floor and then he started the show and he introduced me i came out and it was like it was  insane here's the guy that's interrupting your night just blankly it was the word that was the  worst what about you where was one of your worst rascals in ocean township um i was working with a guy  named bob levy who i loved he's a headliner who i used to um i used to work like the open mic in the bar  area i never worked a big room and so bob who i really admired was hosting and uh you know like  a young talent night he brought me on and i bombed i actually heard the only time i've ever walked 
[02:50:00]  off stage i was like uh it was like seven minutes in finish yeah i was like uh i actually said to the  audience why too dirty and uh you know and i was awful and some guy this wasn't even a good heckle  he goes get a new act oh and i couldn't handle that i was like oh and i'm sorry i wasted your time  and were you being nice i was just humiliated and i was because it was like a validation of  everything i had ever thought that was negative like here it is like we knew it was coming didn't 
[02:50:30]  we you fucking nothing and here it is um and uh when i walked off some guy i'll never forget this  one guy goes ah you'll get it next time which was a cheese dick thing to say you know it's like  that's great if you're a little eager i'm not a 21 year old creep who's probably gonna get his dick  stared at in a restroom on the way home um you know parkway back in those days couldn't help it  look young but uh that is brutal i think it was the night before desert storm happened because i  remember i wanted to go on the next i called the manager that night the owner ward magnuson 
[02:51:00]  and i'm like i'm gonna get out of the business he's like oh just soul search and see how you feel  and that for some reason that just resonated with me one night can make you just go i want out  don't you always feel for people when they come up to you and they go dude i'm 35 and i've been  wanting to do that for 20 years and i just never and i always feel like just do it man i try it i  always feel for guys who say they wanted to and didn't try it those guys always are you know how  horrifying stand-up is though for for people like to be alone in front of people and think if if they 
[02:51:30]  don't laugh i i don't know the flop sweat that would come out the the fear the i the fight or flight  response you'd get see you know you know i didn't i don't know about jim but i didn't break it down like  that i i was like it was like all right i want to try doing this i didn't break like what you just  described i didn't think maybe that will happen i knew it might i knew it who knows what's going to  happen but i didn't like you didn't really you didn't really break it down yeah and uh but i say to 
[02:52:00]  people you know trying it i say to people why i did it was i wanted to try it and either have it work or  not work but i didn't want to be doing some job like in wyoming or doing like an accountant in  in wyoming wondering what would have happened if i tried it so that i forced myself to do it  right just because you and you look back sometimes on those moments and you go like thank god i didn't  listen to my fear or i didn't make that one turn that would have changed everything and who knows 
[02:52:30]  what i'd be doing now yeah yeah watch the odds of it i would have won the powerball i would have  bought a ticket and won 300 million if you hadn't gone to the club that night exactly it's a  fucking needy maybe if steven pick your numbers and maybe it didn't work out maybe there was  something right around the corner i might have broken down on the way home and bob de niro might  have picked me up exactly being a movie whatever it was he would say to a young lad in purple workout 
[02:53:00]  pants there's a lot of funny people out there like on twitter you on twitter yeah there's a lot  of it's just steven right on twitter yeah but it's yeah okay s-t-e-v not ph so people know steven  right to check out on twitter there's a lot of funny people out there um like i laugh sometimes reading  like you know show fans will write stuff funny guys out there's a lot of funny guys and like what  separates us from them i mean maybe we're funnier or maybe we just did something that they went left 
[02:53:30]  and we went right it's like i'm always looking at people who say i was gonna do it but i i  fucking didn't do it and it's like oh god yeah if you're thinking of trying to try it if you suck  so what the worst that can happen is you bomb yeah what are you gonna go be a cop like it's it's  amazing to me how people will take such a dangerous job where you can get shot without  there'll be a fireman you know i just stayed with the fire department yeah god forbid they stare at  you instead of running into a burning building you fucking lunatic what we do is easy compared  to what you're doing the risk factor you'll be you'll be amazed how many people find it a lot 
[02:54:00]  scarier to just get up in front of everybody alone with a microphone they'd rather run into a burning  building that stops a lot of people going for their dreams they're scared it comes down you're just  scared and there's a comfort zone that you're comfortable with obviously so you just kind of  stay in there uh we worked together we did uh leary's uh comics come home and it was the first  time i was ever get to be on stage yeah yeah like you know it was cam neely's uh yeah it was great 
[02:54:30]  we used to go we used to go every year man what a great line i'm kind of bummed they stopped filming  that damn thing because i can't get up there you know did they stop filming it yeah years ago i  wonder if the comics put a stop to that huh i wonder if the comedian said no maybe comedian stopped uh  signing off i don't know maybe it was just time to move on from that but uh that comics come home  every year is great but it was like watching you on stage i had never seen you live only on  television and it was it was fucking hilarious man i mean it was it was like six thousand people there  and you just murdered yeah it gives you faith in audiences when you see a guy not doing bullshit 
[02:55:00]  and not overselling stuff and doing real jokes and just killing and you're like all right well  you had a great set that night too yeah they were good excellent yeah thank you that was a good  crowd man it was uh it was it was a fun night no i don't think anybody ate their balls although you're  always kind of rooting for that you know it's like you're always kind of rooting for someone's  gotta go down yeah yeah first time i saw you was in the cellar oh god right like a year and a half  ago maybe yep excellent thank you oh thank you man and uh one of the comedians was really nervous that 
[02:55:30]  you were there um this guy anthony uh anthony jeselnik he was really nervous really yeah yeah like he  was a fan yeah he loves steven and he wanted to perform well and i don't know how he did but i  heard it wasn't as good as he had hoped oh which i'm really hoping that's true if anybody knows  anthony i got a question for steven did you ever feel the pressure of changing your delivery because  you're so unique and kind of monotone do you ever feel like i i need to get you know more energetic  obviously it works i'm not questioning that at all but you're so unique did you feel like oh boy uh 
[02:56:00]  maybe i should change this up maybe earlier in the career because it was no no it wasn't what later  there's not a lot of guys like you at all did you mean later on or in the beginning probably  no no you know what you're doing obviously i'm talking in the beginning no because you hit that  stage and extremely unique compared to everybody else there was no thing like how you are thinking  about it i didn't think about it right all i did was try to write jokes that i thought was funny  but that's the rest no it was innocence it was like no it was like how i was saying it it didn't 
[02:56:30]  even enter my mind i was just trying to write things that only made a little laugh at this  how it wasn't until a year later in the boston phoenix someone wrote an article about me and it  said no no monotone deadpan and i was like deadpan is that good yeah maybe i guess i guess i am  i never even thought about it my entire life sure so i didn't break it down like like you are it was  like just the jokes the whole other the whole rest of it was like it just was happening watching 
[02:57:00]  from the outside you hit everyone's like but not even the delivery stuff but just the jokes themselves  are very unique uh the whole act is unique and and it seems like when you when you say when you  tell a joke you kind of look at it like why the fuck didn't i think of that like that's it's it's  it's pretty much an observation of of everyday life but you you do twist it around it's a very  unique talent and were you doing that like at eight years old just kind of no i didn't write 
[02:57:30]  jokes till that no not right i couldn't write it i would remember being liking words like i remember  saying the word premises over and over for no reason when i was like four till it doesn't sound  like it anymore and i remember being in junior height sitting with some guys saying imagine a  flock of false teeth you know i mean that's not an actual joke but it was just like the con layering 
[02:58:00]  concepts and it sounds like it feels good coming a flock of false teeth it's almost something that  could get you slapped in the face and yet it's totally clean there's something pleasing about saying  that it's pleasing to the palate to say a flock of false teeth but it is a lot of stuff where you're  like wow god damn that's brilliant that it's it's right in front of your face but you don't those  are the best jokes that they're not most of them aren't like that but the best ones are the ones that  when you think of it and then it's like wow this has been sitting yeah i've seen it i've seen this 
[02:58:30]  little bit of sand has been over it yeah blew it away a little bit it's like don't you think yes  it's like obvious but no one did it yet do you know as we're talking your toe on it you  stuck exactly i know the luck thing you need look at that joke that is a perfect joke i wasn't on  this page right now yes i'm sorry i truly don't i truly don't believe that no no it's funny i think  you're brilliant and you deserve everything you got but it's this luck thing it's kind of funny today 
[02:59:00]  i will never again literally hear the to the phrase like that's a small world without in my head  tagging it with but i wouldn't want to paint it it's like what a gee that was so that was made to  be a setup it's a small world that's a semicolon that's a world and he fucking picked it up and  and you're right that's exactly it's like and there it is that gem you know it's it's jokes it's  funny goddamn jokes which makes the makes the act who did you like coming up when you were young 
[02:59:30]  who did you kind of look at uh well i watched johnny all the time i watched i loved robert klein yeah  love him amazing you ever see robert klein at yale where he's talking about the mummer's day  parade and he's wearing that awful sweater you probably had seen it's one of his specials from  from yale he's one of the greatest he him and david brenner and uh fryer and bill cosby and carlin  my main guys were carlin and uh woody yale and there was a radio show in boston every sunday night 
[03:00:00]  they played two comedy albums the guy would play one cut from one one to the other back and forth  so he played both albums and i stumbled on this around the same age i was starting to watch johnny  like 15 stumbled had a radio in bed with me and every sunday i tuned in and i heard both out laying  there in the dark listening like and i was like i i think i was studying it without known i was just  loved it so much and i thought oh i like what that guy's doing oh that's interesting and woody 
[03:00:30]  allen did a double stand-up album before he made movies it's called the stand-up years double album  and i heard that and it was like that's amazing the writing of the jokes the way he wrote stuff  so him and carlin were my main guys oh wow i think what he might be because prior and carlin were  social geniuses and woody might be the best pure joke writer ever his i agree it was if it's from  62 63 and it's whatever 64 maybe and uh it has none of that stuff has been that was in the air of take 
[03:01:00]  my wife please right um and fucking woody comes out with this brilliant it's still funny i still listen  to it i'm like awed by how great he was at writing jokes what do you saw his new movie excuse me the  other night it was unbelievable i heard it's really good midnight fantastic midnight in paris  right yeah i've seen the movies over the years and i think oh that's good that's pretty good that's  good and i was blown away by this one wow i might go see it again i very rarely go see the movie 
[03:01:30]  twice while it's in the theater maybe three times in the last 15 years he still writes on a typewriter  he does he's a weird guy yeah they have he uses a typewriter to write he does not use a computer  that's probably makes him comfortable that about he likes that feeling probably yeah it's probably  makes him comfortable that's good what did you what did you find uh or what attracted you to  carson like what what did you like about johnny and that he was he was i don't know he was likable 
[03:02:00]  and he was like to do that new material every night that new five minutes there was i don't i can't  really i loved him i don't even know what i know what i don't know all the time too i watched him  all the time growing up and and there was just something so likable about the guy yeah yeah and  just funny goofies like the mighty carson art players and when he'd do those bits and his monologue  like he wasn't afraid to acknowledge that a joke bombed and made it even funnier that was the thing 
[03:02:30]  the joke either worked or he made it funny because it didn't work so it always worked no one else was  really goofing on the fact that their jokes didn't work back then either it's like and he knew how to  handle like he knew how to laugh and they said he never tried to be the star he was the funniest guy  in the room but he did he just lobbed them up and then step back and let you yeah he never competed  with his guests to be funnier or smarter than they were and how many how many times did you do uh  the tonight show about 12 about 12 times wow he was just like what you said i mean he he wanted you to 
[03:03:00]  get the laughs he wanted you you know he just set it up like he was so smooth too he could talk to  anybody yeah a scientist a five-year-old kid yep an actor yeah anyone he was always smooth it was  never an awkward conversation and you never noticed like i never like the setups you never wondered  how does he know he went scuba diving who the fuck told him you never realized  never thought of that it never occurred to me yeah yeah someone told me and it was just it was

[03:49:30]  that thank you very much i know that the illuminati the illuminati you said looks the head of the  illuminati patrice said he looks like the quaker oats guy  it's just this vast white conspiracy that's based on symbols and stuff you know like the masons and  and uh the pyramid and the eyeball on the back of the dollars and and the pentagram and pentagon  i don't want to believe it i don't want to believe it but you look there's a youtube thing called just  look at the the symbols you look at the dollar let's let's take the fucking dollar and the fact 
[03:50:00]  that after 9 11 you can fold it up and you can see the twin towers burning right why i could also  fold up washington's head and make it look like a mushroom but wait a minute does that mean the  fuck mushrooms good when you fold up a dollar does it look like the world tracing a burning  because you're because you're crazy and you have problems in your brain because your brain doesn't  but and then who the fuck two things because you're putting all your energy in the wrong places  it's not which is what black people do this is this is what this is what bothers me yeah 
[03:50:30]  about some it does about some of you the illuminati come on man that takes too much work to get the  dollar bill just right tonight if we're gonna rig 9 11 why would you have to use that language  oh rig that's why do we go all the way back to the dollar design and yeah that's a lot of  we gotta get this that's a lot of organization okay that's a lot of patience too why would it do it  why the fuck and why wouldn't they have done it a lot earlier because it's like look we got the 
[03:51:00]  dollar bill set we got let's do this immediately why is right i knew it copious on the fucking dollar  bill wow now i gotta pull out a black guy trying to read latin is about as sad as  oh shit i only got hundreds damn and no surprise i have no money so i'm kidding  all right let me see oh here's a dollar what just what the  is this on fire thing come on how do you do the that's it's some kind of  i don't know how to do it it's like origami you gotta do 
[03:51:30]  you need a mad fold-in it's the front it's a mad fold-in oh yeah you do this is it the front  you gotta front all right because his hair is smoke and then the no no no it's trees trees  the frame around his head is uh looks like a tower if you fold it right no it's not i think his head  is the smoke fuck man you forgot how to do it you don't know how to do it google shit oh there it is  there look look right there oh yeah you gotta fold it in a triangle the fuck on man dude i'm gonna get 
[03:52:00]  look at that first of all it's a 20 oh it's a 20 yeah you idiot shit patrice go knock one of them  over the head and grab one oh it's a 20. dude look at that shit that's nothing that's nothing to you  that's somebody why would we do that  what's to be gained because like the honor the back of a 20 was designed like a million years ago  yeah exactly why why do that just to go na na na na na like the reverend right say you think we we 
[03:52:30]  we designed the 20 and then we to make that picture and then like uh a hundred years later somebody  designed the twin towers to match it there it is it's burning and then look at that there it is  just take a look at two towers one's taller than the other and it's on fire i know let me see let  me see let me see what the what kind of coincidence is that let me see i can't see no i'm not going to  hand it to you i know you'll take it get out of here that's nothing i need a cab money anthony that's 
[03:53:00]  nothing no let me look it's a coincidence it's um i'm trying to think of how someone might have come  up with it yeah exactly but you're right that is quite the coincidence why like who said hey you  know if you fold it why right after 9 11 did that happen why do i know how to do that right after  dude if someone did it before now that would be fucked up if somebody did it before then that'll  be better at least you go oh better look at the towers burning oh and then it happens and then you'd 
[03:53:30]  be like that who was that they did this years before 9 11 and people went ah it looks like nothing  not well and then one day people like holy shit it looks like the tower is burning listen man i'm  gonna try to invent something i'm just gonna take a 10 i'm gonna try to fold it up and show black  people rioting louis louis i am begging to the to half of you yeah i'm gonna i'm just i'm begging to  you all right see you got to give away people more credit than that okay look i want to show you the 
[03:54:00]  back of a 10 folded the same way it's the towers again if you fold any bill like this the towers  are gonna be burning okay then that makes it more scary i'm making a hairy pussy out of my dollar right  give me a few minutes here i'm going with uh 70s earth mama muff what happens if you look at a 20  just look at a 20 for a second the front of it just unfolded and look at andrew jackson and the  collar of his of his jacket oh it looks like two a women's black legs and he's like diving into and 
[03:54:30]  she's got a little white paint look at it do you see it oh yeah i see it like two like knees up in  the air and he's about to dip down and see the little white panties right above the word jackson you  ever do the thing with the butter the girl with the butter woman's pussy the little indian girl that's  on her knees you can make a pussy with the butter no you make tits i mean tits like she's holding the  butter like this but her kneecaps because she's kneeling you could fold her kneecaps up to her chest  yeah why would they do that as a kid that was almost jerk off material this is dismissive i can't 
[03:55:00]  allow this oh you're you can't marginalize the illuminati man it's it's there there's no reason  where's the owl hold on where's the owl patrice huh where's the owl and what does that mean  where's the owl youtube on what dollar bill what dollar bill is the owl on on it on the one i gotta  find out by looking at this there's supposedly something with the illuminati about the owl a small  owl somewhere where i see the eye above the pyramid all right you fold 100 you get nothing  huh you get like a bad shave job on a pussy it looks like where's the owl come on come on where is 
[03:55:30]  the yeah yeah what's this with the owl why does the owl mean so much because the illuminati it's all  evil shit man i wasn't where's the owl the evil that's no it's an owl oh shit thank you thank you  mars of course mars we know what's the matter because he's down but he wants to keep his job  it's a mars come on what is it what is it all right what's the illuminati mars

[03:56:30]  five is a little hard to avoid it's right between four and six okay here's the pyramid look at this  shit is all symbols illuminati all right on our fucking dollar bill yes because these are all  shapes that are very useful in architecture these are all there's a reason why we keep people use  permits believes it what mass believes what is the illuminati what's it's the it's the it's the silent  bunch of white guys like masons and shit like that they're not silent they're ruling everything 
[03:57:00]  openly yeah but they're hurting black people for profit every day why are you looking for secrets  there's no secret it's just like people are kicking your ass with nicholas cage's movie they  made it to make fun of it disney fun out of it right it's real shit it's it's so again it's black  people putting effort in the wrong area look at lucas's one trying to uncover that you think you  think that the founding fathers set something up that has continued all throughout these years and 
[03:57:30]  gotten gotten stronger it's not secret torches they go and it's based on on white people  staying in power absolutely and they fucking they kill they have uh uh uh you know can i ask you  something though here what what do they say when they kill when they kill white girls uh virgin white  girls that is just fun  i hope no one catches how come the founding fathers this was before the civil war and the emancipation 
[03:58:00]  proclamation so there was still slavery black people weren't even it didn't even look like they  were going to be in charge of anything or even come come close to to uh uh being in charge so why  would the founding fathers put in place something to keep the black man down when they were already  i don't think it's made to keep the black man down because it makes everyone suffer it's not just  a black thing it's the it's the master plan but again to make white people why why are you it's the  quiet war that's what the pyramids are it's the masses it's the it's the eyeball is all the  masses the high the pinnacle why are you hiding from everything man why are you folding 20 bills

[04:04:30]  world's top comics coming up this show got me in trouble of course it did this is a very  chipperson thanksgiving what's that on the opian anthony channel  i don't want to say this this is segment 10 kevin the polack kevin polack talks about his  encounters with other celebrities that he does impersonations of like christopher walken and  jack nicholson but he don't do good impersonations i do them better kevin polack don't do good ones i do 
[04:05:00]  like a really good walking oh it's chip chipperson on thanksgiving or something oh what are you a turkey  oh that's a good one right and i would do jack nicholson on thanksgiving he is turkey  it's kevin polack it's the worst of the opian anthony show that's what always made an impression 
[04:05:30]  interesting to me you know you can always uh do the exaggerated version or use the quotes from  films or cowbell i mean stop it already with this right you know one of my stories in the in the act  god forbid you get down to carolines this weekend um i'll go uh please is uh is meeting  is meeting christopher walken uh when he got his hands and feet and signature in cement in front of  the chinese theater holly boulevard i was asked to be one of the two speakers at the ceremony the  other speaker was quentin tarantino of course directed him in pulp fiction i'd never met christopher 
[04:06:00]  walken so i don't know why i'm invited you would assume that you would have before then you would  assume that we had met but the fact that we hadn't met i was honored beyond belief to be asked but i  know i'm there because i do the impersonation right and but i don't know what he thinks of it because  i'm sure this wasn't his idea oh you know get that kid who does me you know i don't see that happening  so i show up and i'm nervous and i see him in person for the first time  shit myself instantly it's him you know and he sees him he goes hi they told me you were coming 
[04:06:30]  thanks thank you and the whole time i'm thinking it doesn't matter what he says  because he's using the voice right i mean i'm i'm crying uh and he said and then we're standing  at each other for like 10 minutes in silence he doesn't say anything and now it's getting weird  and creepy because no one's talking because that's a long time for silence and then finally he turns to  me oh i said something lame at the beginning like congratulations hand the feet in cement very  very cool so after 10 minutes of silence then he finally turns to me and he says cement 
[04:07:00]  wow and that was it i'm on the floor pissing myself laughing because he actually said it you  know it wasn't someone doing a bit right uh and then i got to do the the story of how on halloween  night when kids come to the door i answer the door as christopher walken to try to scare them  i got to do that story in front of him in front of the press at the ceremony for him so to do the  impression of him in front of him in that weird way into out of the corner of my eye seeing him 
[04:07:30]  sort of lean forward at the hit at the waist laughing right that was one of those you can take  me now moments but isn't that a tough that's a tough spot to be in well when you have the real  one there yeah there's no reason for an impersonation right in fact the big part of the act is me  telling stories now about my friends think it's a great idea to do them for them right it's a  horrible idea it's a stupid idea because they're them it doesn't matter how good you think you are  they're better they're better as a rule right like i did a few good men we talked about it all my 
[04:08:00]  friends who knew i've been doing nicholson and my stand-up back before that would call when i was  working on the movie they would call every day did you do jack for jack you got to do it for him he's  he's gonna love it he's gonna love it you gotta do it again friends stupid idiots why would i do  jack for jack why would i be the one millionth dickhead in nicholson's face saying this is what  you sound like you know how who would be that to be anywhere near someone like that let alone working  with them and does anybody even think they sound like they sound anyway like most people hear their 
[04:08:30]  voices and go wait that's me yeah you know so to think like i remember growing up in philly i had  no idea there was a philly accent right i thought we'd talk just like johnny carson so it wasn't until  after we middle america from there right that i started to hear the accent right you know yeah so  alan arkin alan arkin said you know if you notice since you started doing me i stopped stammering  i don't i don't stutter as much i just talk directly and without stopping or thinking i used to 
[04:09:00]  i hated the sound of you pausing and thinking about it yeah sometimes they i gotta ask did you  end up doing jack to jack was there just a moment no there was no way in hell because i was convinced  he was going to say i just assumed that maybe he let his guard down one day and you went ah what the  hell what if he doesn't like it because it was so honestly it was so thrilling to be anywhere near  someone like this let alone have him consider me a fellow professional working on this thing 
[04:09:30]  i'd rather talk to him about you know did he know you did him did him i don't know because i  never asked you know what i mean i had done it on the tonight show with carson i mean i it was out  i know it was out there he could have seen it that's for sure he must have saw it but uh yeah he told  me the most amazing story oh god i've never told this story i just realized um while we're working on a  a few good men uh the the the news breaks uh uh magic johnson is uh hiv while we're working on the 
[04:10:00]  film so everyone of course on the set all the crew everybody one at a time is coming by jack to either  say hey man sorry because you know he's mr lakers right or say what the fuck how did what does this  mean you know because a lot of people just couldn't wrap their brain around it so the whole day jack's  kind of walking around a bit of a fog and you know there's there's base camp where the trailers  are it's always a little bit of a walk from the stage in this case we shot on the sound stage uh or  the set wherever you are so you know i jack was one of those enigmas to me where i wanted to leave 
[04:10:30]  him alone i didn't want to force a conversation on him if it happened it happened i didn't even want  to you know i don't like bugging people because i'm still that kid who can't believe he's there honestly  so and especially with that film for me it was like being brought up to the majors let's face it  everybody in the movie is famous except for me i remember actually you weren't famous then  well i mean i don't know avalon i'd done some things but that movie was a juggernaut you know  nicholson head toe-to-toe with tom cruise i mean it was a bit sure i remember rob reiner said to me 
[04:11:00]  while we were sort of prepping this is uh listen jack's going to be swinging for the fences because  he doesn't you know that's the way the character's written and he's he's going to be in all his glory  tom's going to be swinging for the fences to keep up with jack to me he's definitely got to swing  for the fences to try to come up with those two i need you to hit like a double into the gap  it was so great so he um we're walking back to the base camp where the trailers are  and this one particular day where the news broke about magic and jack's all bummed out is the day 
[04:11:30]  that i find myself walking alone with jack back to the trailers we just got both released at the same  moment or whatever people stand around have a conversation and then he and i are walking  side by side back to the trailers and again i'm not starting the conversation it's a weird day already  for him so he's walking and he just keeps saying it's surreal it's just surreal the whole  fucking thing is surreal and we get closer to the trailers and we pass his first and he's about 
[04:12:00]  he puts his hand on the door he's about to enter his trailer and he stops he turns back around he  says you want to hear a story about surreal and i'm now like are you fucking kidding me jack nicholson  wants to tell me a story about what he thinks is surreal why yes jack let me pull up a fucking chair  so i said yeah sure and he says i'm doing this picture chinatown already i'm done i'm done this is 
[04:12:30]  i'm doing this picture chinatown might have heard of this and i'm rehearsing this scene with the with  john he's talking about john houston who directed it and he's saying i'm doing this scene with john oh  no i didn't direct it uh polanski directed uh john houston acted him acted with him in in the movie as  well as the scene we're rehearsing and um i while we're rehearsing the scene i look over his shoulder and  about i don't know 30 yards away off in the distance walking towards the set is his daughter 
[04:13:00]  angelica and i had just started banging her a couple of weeks before and i hadn't figured out  a way to tell the old man and you have to understand i would have killed for him he was like a surrogate  father he was everything to me and i remember how am i going to tell him if i had it was so upsetting  you know because if he had asked me to kill her in that moment i would have done it that's how much  he meant to me and as i'm thinking about all this i come out of my head back into the rehearsal right 
[04:13:30]  as john houston says to me in the rehearsal of the scene mr gidders are you sleeping with my daughter  that's fucking surreal and he spins around and walks into his trailer and i'm standing there like  did anyone else hear this did that just fucking happen blew my shit anyway i don't know why i've  never told that story that's a great story because he mentions he was banging a junkie yeah don't  want to be disrespectful but there you have it but he was with her for how many years forever yeah  long time yeah nobody bigger right no jack nobody bigger also how do you how are you cool to five 
[04:14:00]  decades right that's the real brain i mean he was cool out of the get you know you know i was at a  a prize fight where it was fucking tons of celebrities i think it was hall of field and  somebody in vegas and literally when fucking nicholson just came in everybody turned all  these celebrities even the celebrities turned to go like jack you can see fucking celebrities go jack 
[04:14:30]  nicholson's here yeah because you see that a lot when you see celebrities that won't turn for other  celebrities yeah but when they do then you know oh fuck that's greatness right there when they're  turning their fucking heads too because kevin's right in like 1969 people were like there's  fucking jack nicholson and it's never stopped 70s 80s 90s the o's and now and now whatever we  call the fuck do you stay cool to each generation it's impossible right sure it's literally impossible  and never done an interview only in print never appeared on camera his entire life to do to give 
[04:15:00]  an interview what about the carson that's what about carson stuff never did never did never did  carson i'm telling you never did anything on camera ever uh he never did carson never did  bizarre i just assumed he did no isn't that something though i'm not again part of the  part of what what kept it so cool wait he never sat down for an interview not kidding i'm learning  this today for the first time you would uh i believe you you would read like in you know esquire  gq yeah he's giving he gives great interviews all that stuff that he'll print those guys a week 
[04:15:30]  but i even remember when they started like when stuff like e entertainment yelled stuff to him as he was  going in and he would just say something on the way in that seemed weird to me right because it was  so long before you you know you would only see pictures of him well here's the question why why  you think that's what he did because he wants to be a fucking or movie star he wants to be an actor  he's old school he's old school and i think the belief was if you get on camera and talk about yourself 
[04:16:00]  people will know that you're not as cool as they thought you were right right i mean honestly it  happens immediately you can't compete with that no just some of the characters he played probably  yeah all right and the fact that we would go make up our own rumors about what his life was right  and so a very chippers and thanksgiving draws to a close  listen for more throughout the weekend and happy holidays from the opian anthony channel </pre>
