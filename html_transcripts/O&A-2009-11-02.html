<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of a 911 call from a woman who self-reported drunk driving, followed by speculation on the outcome of her arrest.  Technical difficulties with the show's audio equipment and concerns about noise complaints interrupted the flow.  The hosts then shifted to discussing the arrest of Reverend Al Sharpton's daughter and ex-wife for disorderly conduct, debating the fairness of the situation and reading Sharpton's tweets.  Warren Haynes, guitarist from the Allman Brothers Band and Government Mule, was the in-studio guest.  The hosts initially struggled with his microphone setup before a successful interview ensued, covering his upcoming tour, new CD ("Buy a Thread"), his work with the Allman Brothers and Grateful Dead, anecdotes about his early career (including playing with David Allen Coe), and answering listener questions. Haynes performed "Soul Shine," "Forevermore," and "Old Friend" live in the studio.  The interview included humorous tangents, such as the origin of "Government Mule."  Haynes departed for a flight to Berlin before the interview concluded.

The show then moved on to a lengthy discussion about the 2009 World Series between the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies.  The hosts heavily critiqued the umpiring, the performance of individual players (A-Rod and Cliff Lee), and the Yankees' spending habits. Opie provided a detailed description of an obnoxious Phillies fan, a "Philly cougar."  The discussion included tangents such as a caller accusing Opie of being a Yankees bandwagon fan, leading to a discussion of the Yankees' history;  a picture of the Phillie Phanatic knocking out a supposed Yankee fan (with Joe Frazier refereeing); a caller accusing a Phillies player of jinxing the team; and critiques of Joe Buck's commentary and Tim McCarver's age.  Multiple callers participated, including Mark (South New Jersey), Drew (Alabama), Jared (Boston), Charlie (Philadelphia), Eddie (St. Louis), Zach, Brian (Philly), Jack (South Carolina), Tony (Philly), Louis (Arizona), D (New York), and Riley (Baltimore).  The hosts also briefly touched upon the New York City Marathon and Brett Favre's return to Green Bay as a Viking.

A significant portion focused on Halloween experiences. Opie recounted a Halloween incident resulting in an unintentionally offensive outburst due to a miscommunication with a trick-or-treater.  Other callers shared their own Halloween candy distribution experiences, including a listener's excessively boozy Halloween party that resulted in significant house damage.  The "Afro Wars" competition between Sam and Danny was highlighted, with Danny's shaved head for Halloween resulting in Sam's victory and discussion of his afro plans.  The hosts also expressed frustration with management's interference with a planned, potentially sexually explicit on-air segment involving Sandy Cain and Bobo, criticizing their lack of understanding of their humor. They also played and critiqued a poorly executed John and Kate Gosselin Halloween skit from a local news station.  This segment included rants about excessive taxation in New York City and the MTA, along with discussions about Amtrak’s financial losses, the USS New York’s construction, and the lack of rebuilding at Ground Zero.  Frequent use of vulgar and offensive language characterized the entire segment.

Finally, the show featured discussions surrounding high taxes and government inefficiency, with callers sharing their experiences with unfair taxation and government waste.  A locomotive engineer from Wisconsin detailed wage cuts in his union.  The conversation veered to a DirecTV commercial featuring digitally enhanced celebrities (Kim Basinger, Chris Farley), prompting debate on its deceptiveness.  A caller, Mike, recounted his father’s forced retirement from Amtrak and detailed the poor quality of Amtrak food.  A call from "Rape Kid" was abruptly ended.  The hosts also discussed the seemingly disproportionate attention given to musical guests on television versus radio, introducing the "Virus" character, before a planned appearance by Warren Haynes and a failed attempt to play a pre-recorded audio bit.  The hosts briefly referenced their "Jocktober" segment as "tasteless" and "tacky." The broadcast ended with various off-topic discussions and the usual vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Congratulations to all you Yankee fans on your 27th World Series.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Stop it!  What? I was watching the news. They said they can't lose now.  Stop it!  You saw it!  I know I saw it.  There's a whole montage of how the Yankees cannot lose this one.  A lot of jinxing going on. I don't like seeing that.  We all have that horrific memory of Boston kicking our asses.  It wasn't horrific for everyone. 
[00:00:30]  Well, no. I'm saying, you know, Yankee fans.  Yeah.  That will stand out in history as one of the worst performances by a team choking.  Well, best performance of a team choking ever.  And no counting chickens. No counting chickens.  Well, the news has it, one.  I think Sam's putting a montage together of the jinx broadcast we just saw.  All the jinx broadcasts where they're like, well, they can't lose now.  No. It's like, we're going to see them win it tonight. 
[00:01:00]  This one's in the bag.  Shut it.  The flea's a problem, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Destroy the Yankees.  Well, here's what I'm really hoping.  They go against Lee.  And lose.  No, no, no.  You want them to lose so you could win it at home.  Don't care.  Don't care.  Every sports fan wants their team to win it at home.  Come on.  I want to see that loudmouth bitch behind home plate cry.  I'll get into that later.  But I want to see them go in. 
[00:01:30]  And I want to see Lee get a fucking pasting to see that, like, oh, that was a fluke the other day.  All right.  Now the Yankees have come to play with this fucking guy.  Will it happen?  Very rare.  Now Lee's going to kick ass tonight.  Lee's very good.  And then you get your championship at home.  And then you get to go to the game.  Get to, you know, cheer on your Yankees.  Well, that would be nice to go to the fucking game.  That would be nice, right?  That would be nice.  But I'd rather them just clean it up there so that that fucking pit. 
[00:02:00]  There was a woman that completely distracted me from the game.  Some Philly cougar in a white turtleneck shirt.  And whenever there was a left-hand batter, you could see this woman.  And what a loudmouth Philly whore this woman was.  Just a loudmouth.  Obviously, a lot of people this World Series and during the playoffs are having a problem with strikes and balls. 
[00:02:30]  And the umps calls on them.  The strike zone for a while last night.  Well, I don't know where the fuck it was.  They were showing on the fire.  Literally, they were perfect strikes.  He called balls against the Yankees.  It was crazy.  It was terrible.  And then strikes that were balls.  Balls out with strikes.  It was insane.  Maybe Fox's technology is off.  Maybe it's technology.  Maybe.  The camera angles are so goddamn good.  You're seeing that going, and they show the replay and everything.  When you've got robots that can tell you if it's a ball or strike, I don't know why you're using human eyes. 
[00:03:00]  Why are you using this fat fuck?  I mean, use the human eyes for everything else.  And this woman is hanging out back there.  And then at one point, Posada turns around to the ump to go like, hey, you sure about that?  You know, whatever they say to the ump when it's a bad call.  They think it's a bad call.  You just see her face, and she goes, shut up!  To Posada.  That's awesome.  And it's like, oh, you classless whore. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, did I want to see someone come by and spill a beer on her head?  I really want to see her if we can get a string cap of her.  She had a turtleneck on.  Then I guess she got a little chilly, so she put a little jacket on over it.  You were obsessed with her, huh?  She's behind the guy in, uh, one guy in red.  Well, they're all in red.  Yeah, I know.  Jesus.  But no, there was one guy right there that had a, um, and kind of behind the, I think she  was a little more to the left of that shot.  And you could hear her?  Dude, the whole time, I Twittered it last night and got so many responses from people 
[00:04:00]  going, oh my God, I thought it was the only one that noticed this loud mouth bitch.  You have a picture of her?  And you could just hear it.  And then he goes, and then somebody said, she, he swears that he heard her yell the  N-word out to Cece at some point.  Come on.  She, no.  Come on.  She was that type of person.  Well, she absolutely was.  What type of person?  Yeah, his old mate.  Privileged.  Thank you.  I didn't know how to say it to me.  I was trying to keep it safe.  But get my point across.  You nailed it. 
[00:04:30]  Just an old Philly cougar.  Shut your yap.  Hey, let me go to Mark.  Put your fucking Philly fight towels down.  Wipe your ass with it.  Wipe your ass with it.  Towels.  Stop it.  Spinning the towels.  It's their thing.  What can I tell you?  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  I love fans with props.  Terrible.  Stop it.  Mark in South New Jersey.  Mark.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up?  Hey, Opie.  You know, it's me being a faithful Philadelphia Phillies fan. 
[00:05:00]  And I think it's time for you to jump on the Yankees bandwagon.  You know, I got to tell you, I've been looking at those Yankee hats going, you know what?  I think I would look good in a Yankee hat.  I'd feel bad if I even thought for a second Opie might be a Yankee fan.  He is incapable of becoming a fan of a team he despises.  But I'm not even a rah-rah, I want the Phillies to win.  I'm just in a bad spot this year.  But if the Mets fans are in a bad spot.  You'd be fucking crazy for them.  I'd be rah-rah-ing the Mets. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Even though I haven't really followed them that closely in the last few years.  You're not missing much.  Nah.  I follow their injury stats this year.  It was fantastic.  So one to go.  You guys are feeling good?  Feeling good.  You know, a little tentative.  You've got to look out.  And that Sox meltdown is always in the back of your head.  So I just hope they can do something tonight.  I hope they beat up Lee a little bit more.  He was ridiculously dominant in game two. 
[00:06:00]  So you don't have confidence in your team.  No, no.  I have the absolute confidence.  Let Lee have his win tonight.  Fuck him.  And then you guys get your big World Series at Yankee Stadium.  With his let me catch the ball like I'm fucking Bugs Bunny playing the Gas House Gorillas.  Stop it.  Because he's bored out there.  He's that damn good.  He's behind my back.  What are you going to do today?  Pitch with a mirror over your shoulder?  Backwards?  You magician.  I'll tell you this much.  The umps in this World Series suck a dick.  Terrible.  Is it?  Or has the coverage gotten so good? 
[00:06:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Me and Jimmy were mentioning something.  Hold on.  My reason for this is very simple.  When A-Rod got hit in the first inning, and then the ump is warning both sides.  That was so stupid.  Unnecessary.  There was no reason to hit A-Rod on purpose in that situation.  No, no, no.  And as an umpire, you've got to understand that.  Because now that confuses everybody.  Because, you know, Girardi wanted his animal there to pitch inside, and now he's like,  whoa, whoa, my whole strategy is to pitch the Phillies inside.  Yeah.  Now if my boy hits one of the Phillies, I'm in trouble here. 
[00:07:00]  Why would he warn both teams when the Yankees hadn't even done anything?  It was, you know, why blame, why warn both sides?  But the Phillies have no reason to hit A-Rod in that situation as well.  No one should have gotten a warning.  But I mean, to warn both of them was stupid.  Uh-oh.  What, Jimmy?  What?  Share!  Share!  I didn't know that they did this.  Share!  There's a picture of the Philly Fanatic with a pair of boxing gloves on, and the guy they 
[00:07:30]  pretend is a Yankee fan knocked out.  The Philly Fanatic knocked him out.  Oh, gosh.  That is funny.  You're missing something in that picture.  Well, Joe Frazier's the guest ref.  Joe Frazier's the guest ref.  Joe Frazier actually agreed to that.  Did he?  Then again, we had Joe Frazier in here, and I don't think he knew what he was agreeing  to.  He should have belted the Fanatic in the head.  Just watch him fucking fall over.  Imagine he agrees to do the skid, and he thinks, oh, you want me to fight the Philly 
[00:08:00]  Fanatic?  Yeah, you want me to fight him for real?  Pull that stupid party favor out of his mouth and punch him between the eyes.  Let me say hi to Drew in Bama, as in Alabama mall.  Drew, what do you got, man?  Ant, what's happening?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Ant, man, you're talking a lot of trash about Philly with the flags and stuff, or the...  The towels, yes.  Philly fight towels.  Well, honestly, man, Yankees have bought the best players for years. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Stop.  Oh, my God.  Have they really?  Have they?  Wow, I never heard this argument before.  And?  But you can't downplay that and yell at another team for having silly props.  Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  Because buying a team, any team can spend money, and the Yankee team that was built, that  was the great Yankee team, was all farm system guys.  Yep.  And they made a lot of bad moves after, and Yankee fans hated a lot of those big-name buys 
[00:09:00]  that didn't work out.  The big units.  Randy Johnson.  Stop.  Fucking Gary Sheffield.  All these guys that were never wanted.  Crap.  Coming along.  When the Yankees built to the three out of the four-year championships, there was done  on a trade for Knobloch and a bunch of fucking farm system guys.  Jimmy turned back into a hardcore Yankee fan in the last two weeks.  Yeah, it's like, I couldn't not.  This is like the old Jimmy.  What's going on?  I'm so confused this morning.  I got sick of not watching the team.  And now the way I'm watching again, I'm like, this is why. 
[00:09:30]  You were motherfuckering these guys for the last year and a half, two years.  I'm like, this is why I don't like sports.  Because it affects me so much.  Isn't it like personal?  I literally.  I'm so confused right now.  I literally, at one point last night, had to put down what I was eating because I was  going to throw it through my flat screen television.  When Chamberlain gave up that home run, I'm like, I'm going to throw it.  And my girlfriend's watching it.  I'm like, she's like, at least there wasn't two men on, a man on.  I'm like, you don't get it.  You don't get it.  It was a bullpen.  It was four to two.  And the fucking bullpen comes in and gives up that fucking final run. 
[00:10:00]  That fucking job.  But when I see him warming up in the pen, I get an ulcer.  And I'm ready to throw things at that point.  Oh, is he the, oh.  Here's your, you got a guaranteed win tonight, Anthony.  Oh, great.  Really?  Guaranteed win.  Well, the news has said so.  And we put a little montage together for you.  Well, it could be all over tonight.  The Yankees are just one win away from their first World Series title in nine years.  Good morning, everyone.  And welcome to Philadelphia.  The Yankees now just one win away from their 27th World Championship. 
[00:10:30]  And remember, when Joe Girardi signed on as manager here, he picked the number 27 because  he wanted to capture that 27th World Championship.  And the Yankees will go after that tonight.  We're out here in front of Citizens Bank Park.  And I want you to take a look at that because that P up there that stands, of course, for  Phillies baseball, they're going to have to change that to a Y or an NY for Yankees after  tonight's win because you know they are going to win the game tonight.  You know what?  I have to tell you all in all, Phillies fans, I mean, of course, we're making fun of them 
[00:11:00]  and teasing them because we know that they're ultimately going to be very sad because the  Yankees will end up winning the World Series.  Tonight will be one more win coming our way.  That's the very latest from here.  Back to you guys in the studio.  You guys are so losing.  That's a broad thing.  And this has nothing to do with my dumb sports cars.  You're so losing.  Jinx, jinx, jinx, jinx.  You're so losing.  Well, the jinx thing I bring up because of stupid Joe Buck, that motherfucker who just  every time he has to say something about the Yankees right before something bad usually 
[00:11:30]  happens.  It didn't last night.  But when Rivera comes out to relieve, and it's like, well, Rivera been perfect every  outing in this postseason.  It's just been amazing.  He's never blown a three-run lead in the postseason.  Never blown a three-run lead in the postseason.  And I'm sitting there going, wow, we are going to see the first time he's done this now.  But he didn't. 
[00:12:00]  I know he didn't.  And thank God his talent was better than Joe Buck's curse.  But the curse of Joe Buck, it is there.  What happened to Tim McCarver?  I remember when he used to call a really good baseball game.  He's just an old fucking doddering fool.  He's a bit on the doddering side, isn't he?  I heard him talking about Pearl Jam last night.  Was he really talking about Pearl Jam?  Yeah.  He likes the new album or something.  I think it was Joe Buck.  Maybe it was Joe Buck.  McCarver didn't know what the fuck he was talking about.  All right.  I really wished I was listening to Sterling last night, though, in that ninth inning. 
[00:12:30]  When Johnny Damon, when he jumped off a second, I'm like, what the fuck is he doing?  Were you freaking out?  What are you doing?  Like, he gets to second, just beats the throw to second, and then he gets up and starts running  to third.  And you're like, he's in a rundown.  And then you realize, there's no one on third.  Where was the person that was supposed to be on third?  The infield that shifted, I think.  I don't know exactly where he was.  Shifted where?  To the dugout?  I don't know.  There was no one even close to third.  I got an inside info thing on that one.  Oh, you did? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, he had to go take a leak.  Oh, he had to pee-pee?  He had to pee-pee.  It happens to the best of him.  Your hope is not a big play when you do that.  Well, unfortunately, in this case, there was.  But he had to take care of business.  Lidge was supposed to be on third?  Yeah.  It was just the oddest fucking play.  And to see him get up, and the camera angle was weird, because it only showed the second  base and Damon.  And when you saw him get up and leave the base and start running, I was thinking, he's 
[00:13:30]  lost his fucking mind.  Where did the third baseman go to cover, though?  That is a weirdo.  He ran to cover something.  He was going to let the cover.  The third baseman covered second, because they over-shifted for Teixeira to bet.  They over-shifted that much at the third baseman at second?  Yes.  Well, the third baseman would end up playing shortstop.  And then where was short?  Short would be over by second.  And then the third baseman was, I mean, and then the second baseman goes into, like,  you know, the middle outfield.  It was confusing for everybody.  It was a complete lack of protection of third baseman. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, it was a breakdown.  It happened just gone.  Hey, Drew wanted to make his point.  I didn't realize he had a point.  Drew, what was your point?  My point was, how long do you boys think it's going to be until you see Chase Utley in  the fucking pinstripes?  Yes.  And Lee.  Yeah, pick them up.  What the fuck?  And Lee.  No, no, no.  I'm a Braves fan.  I'm a Braves fan.  But the Yankees have bought the best players in Major League Baseball for the last couple 
[00:14:30]  of years.  You're going to tell me that, hold on, dude.  You're going to tell me that Philadelphia has a small market team?  Are you going to tell me that Boston Red Sox getting guys like Manny Ramirez?  Are you going to tell Philadelphia has Pedro?  Are you going to tell me a lot of these teams are?  Come on, stop.  Yeah, just stop it.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying New York Yankees are the biggest market, and they can draw the biggest teams.  They've got the biggest budget, man.  They get the best players.  They have finally bought the best players.  Yeah, yeah.  They've made some horrible decisions over the last fucking eight years. 
[00:15:00]  They haven't won in nine years, dude.  Nine fucking years they haven't won, making horrid decisions on who they're buying.  And, of course, they won't buy Utley until he's like fucking 50 years old.  Then they'll buy him.  What happened to the old Jimmy, though?  Oh, I'm really confused.  The old Jimmy was a Yankee fan.  And then I went through a thing after Jeter was in.  How long?  Two years?  My whole life I was a Yankee.  No, you were hating the Yankees for at least two years?  It was more than two years, dude.  And now you're back.  I think you only started rooting again the last, what, couple weeks?  Last month. 
[00:15:30]  I would say last month.  When the playoffs started.  Jimmy's back.  Towards the end of the season, Ant started watching it again.  And he's like, dude, if you're going to come back, this is a good year to do it.  At least you're being honest about it.  And I went to a game last year.  I went to, because I was like, fuck the Yankees.  And then I went to, me and Stunt Brain went to the third to the last game of the season in the old stadium.  I had to go.  Yeah.  But I started to really soften then, because I went to the game.  And I'm like, what am I doing?  I can't not, I can't dislike Jeter.  I mean, all right, the guy was a dick to me. 
[00:16:00]  It happens.  Did Stunt Brain look at Joe Buck the whole time, going, man, I wish I had that much hair?  Oh, my God.  Joe Buck's giant.  I was saying, they ought to, like, green screen his forehead and just have, like, bud ads run across him.  I think Joe Buck's got some of those hair plugs.  No.  But he didn't have enough harvest area.  Oh.  Look closely.  I think he did a little hair plugging, but just didn't have enough.  It's not even where the hair belongs.  He's got a huge area between his eyes and, like, where the hairline belongs.  You can kind of see a fake hairline going on.  It's a giant forehead. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, Drew, what?  What, Drew?  He might have signed off.  But you know what?  What did this Rollins say?  What the media says means nothing.  The media's not going to jinx the team, because the media are idiots.  Other players can jinx the team, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Did this Rollins really think the Phillies were going to beat the Yankees in five games?  Did he say that?  Oh, yeah.  This dumb motherfucker actually said that?  Yeah.  Why would you say that?  It's a jinx the team.  Think it.  Say it to your friends.  Why would you say that when the other team hears you?  Let me say hi to Jared in Boston. 
[00:17:00]  Jared.  Jared.  Hey, guys.  Drew, I know you're still listening.  You're a fucking fucktard.  Why the fuck?  All right.  I'm from Boston, but Jesus Christ, you're an idiot.  New York and Boston both pay the fucking luxury tax, you idiot.  Just because New York was playing like a well-oiled machine in September while my team was falling apart like a fucking bunch of idiots.  Dude, you're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  All right.  There you go.  So, we got a game tonight.  Yes.  We certainly do. 
[00:17:30]  I might have tickets for tonight's game if you want to take a trip to Philly.  Philly?  No.  No?  I want to go to Philly on a fucking Monday.  Mondays are depressing enough.  Yeah, you get to see your team win the World Series, though.  Yeah, in Philly.  Good seats, too.  Hey, New York City Marathon was yesterday, and I was very confused because they said the first American since 1982 won the New York City Marathon.  If you know anything about running, it's always Africans, Ethiopians, Kenyans, Israelis, and Polacks. 
[00:18:00]  The Irish.  But it's never a guy with an American-sounding name.  No, it's not like, you know, fucking Bud Johnson.  Right, right.  There's old Bill Smith is going to.  So, I think we just bought a New York City Marathon win.  That's how we did, like the Yankees.  Just like the Yankees.  I think America went and said, you know what?  Some of you Kenyans, we're going to set you up nice in America.  You're now American citizens because we really need a New York City Marathon win. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I think that's what happened because this guy is not an American.  I think he became a citizen last year or something.  Yeah, this guy became an American citizen.  Which I guess technically he is and all that, but.  Well, technically, but it's like saying Kunta Kinte was an American.  Listen for his name here.  Today, for the first time in nearly three decades, an American was victorious on the streets of New York,  but wherever the runners finished, they all deserved a big pat on the back.  Congratulations! 
[00:19:00]  Congratulations!  Congratulations in order for everyone who crossed the finish line at the New York City Marathon.  But the biggest salute went to Mebka Fledgy.  The East...  I look, I...  Mebka Fledgy?  I've lived in about ten cities.  I'm getting up there in age now.  No, I've never met a Mebka Fledgy.  Mebka Fledgy.  Have you ever met a Meb?  No.  In your travels in America?  I don't know a Meb.  New York City Marathon. 
[00:19:30]  But the biggest salute went to Mebka Fledgy,  the East African immigrant who became the first American man to win the race in 27 years.  I'm just praying that this will be my day, you know,  and a lot can change by winning this race.  He crossed the finish line in two hours, nine minutes, 15 seconds,  and was quickly overcome with emotion.  I thought there was going to be clicking.  He's a breathe-right strip on his nose, too.  I like that.  Oh, yeah?  I love this guy.  Whoever said you was one, Meb? 
[00:20:00]  Hey, he spoke the language, so...  God bless it.  That's nice.  God bless him.  He ran 26 miles in a little over two hours.  Yeah.  Those guys are animals.  I was watching Apocalypto the other night.  You've seen that?  Oh, yeah.  Where those guys just ran for days.  And it's like, that's the type of running that you have to be accustomed to doing.  Yeah.  Or you genetically have to be able to do.  Or you'll just drop dead.  He ran 13 miles an hour.  Twice.  It's amazing.  Let's say hi to D in New York. 
[00:20:30]  D?  No, we lost D.  Another one that wanted to yell at Drew.  Okay.  Oh, here's Drew.  Drew.  Hey, fucking, what's up with the fucking faggots trashing me, man?  All I was trying to do was make a point to Ant.  They fucking, y'all bought the World Series.  It's about time he got you one.  Well, the gentleman before that was saying that he's a Boston fan, and Boston pays a luxury tax.  Boston.  Yes, Boston.  Yeah.  Because they, you know, have a lot of high-priced players, and they have a big budget. 
[00:21:00]  They couldn't afford Manny.  Go ahead.  It's your show.  No, I'm just glad it's your show.  I'm sure they could have afforded Manny.  Yeah, yeah.  They probably didn't want to pay him.  They lost Manny because they couldn't afford him.  They couldn't afford him.  Is that what you're saying there, Drew?  Ah, nah.  So we weren't able to buy a World Series for nine years.  They got their World Series, and then they fucking decided to bail out.  When we were spending giant amounts of money on shitty players that were past their prime, 
[00:21:30]  huge amounts of money, we weren't able to buy ourselves a World Series, as you say it.  Now we're able to.  George Steinbrenner not being actively involved with the team is a huge...  Congratulations.  Oh, it's so much better.  All right, dude.  I love your books.  Love you.  Thank you, buddy.  Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Love you, sir.  Thank you.  It was a huge thing for the Yankees.  He's not buying...  I don't like these fucking big-name free agents that come in.  They don't contribute anything.  They're just big names that he wanted to see in Yankee uniform.  That's all he wanted.  It was like a mission of his to collect players and have them in pinstripes. 
[00:22:00]  And now that he's out of it, it's nice to see them looking at players that have potential,  good players, sticking with their old guys, you know, relatively speaking, old guys.  And Joe Girardi's doing a good job, man.  He's made his mistakes, especially in the postseason and stuff.  He's made a few calls that you're like, eh, well, what are you doing?  It doesn't matter.  We're in a three-to-one lead.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie! 
[00:22:30]  Oh, put time.  What's up, boys?  Shut up.  Not even my dumb sports silly curse thing is going to fuck this one up.  Charlie, what do you got, buddy?  Jimmy made that comment about Rollins making that prediction.  I mean, the owner of the Phillies was quoted as saying, bring on the Yankees.  They're the best.  We want to beat the best.  Hey, asshole, you got your wish now, didn't you?  But that's different, though.  That's different.  Saying that is saying, hey, look, we want to beat the best team is actually, in a way,  complimentary to the Yankees.  That's not saying we're going to beat them in X amount of games is different. 
[00:23:00]  Saying we think we're going to win the series.  You're supposed to say that as a player.  Yes, we're going to win.  You have to say that.  But to say I'm going to beat them in five, it's like, what are you doing?  That's like you're saying we're going to kick the shit out of the team.  That's cocky.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I agree.  My thought is beat them, then talk your shit.  Yeah, well, you know, the Phillies can absolutely take this tonight.  They can absolutely take this game tonight.  I'm not saying like, yeah, yeah, I'm not sitting here going, Yankees are going to destroy 
[00:23:30]  them tonight.  Yeah, fuck it.  They can absolutely take it.  We shall see.  All right, let's go to St. Louis.  Eddie, what's up, Eddie?  What's up, Eddie?  How you guys doing?  I honestly think that Cliff Lee is not going to beat the Yankees twice.  If there's one thing that they do great, it's make adjustments.  And also, the next time that there's a Phillies-Yankees World Series, which could very  well happen next year, make a bet with Ron Bennington, Anthony.  Come on.  You've got to put some skin in the game.  Otherwise, it's just talk.  I understand.  Why didn't you make any bets?  I wish I would have.  You know why?  Because Bennington ain't talking to me. 
[00:24:00]  Well, that's because you told him he was going to take all those dicks in his ass.  Well, eh, maybe that's it, but I passed by him in the hallway.  You know what he did?  What did he do?  He fucking, like, hit me with his shoulder and just kept walking, like, fuck you.  Kind of a bam.  Yeah.  No shit.  That's old school Philly stuff.  I like that.  That's old school Philly stuff.  I like that.  Exactly.  He's got that Philly in his blood.  I like that.  Is he from Philly, Ron?  I hope he is.  Originally, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let's go to Zach.  Well, he can take a train and live there if he wants to root against the New York team. 
[00:24:30]  You told him.  I don't mean to be so harsh, Ron.  I apologize.  Zach Key, what's up?  Yeah.  Contrary to the president, we have an office right now.  We are still a capitalistic country.  And the more money you have, the better things you can buy.  Anthony gets to go buy cool guns.  I buy little $200 guns.  It's all about who has the money.  So the Yankees deserve it.  They work harder. 
[00:25:00]  They've got the money.  Who cares?  All these people bitching about those small market teams in Atlanta.  And, you know, shut your mouth.  Are there any other sport dynasties that are known for having spent money on very good players?  Well, not like the Yankees.  What about the heyday of the Bulls?  Not like the Yankees.  Oh, yeah.  That Michael Jordan guy.  I think he cost a little bit.  Yeah, but...  How about Kobe Bryant and everything the Lakers did when they went?  I say the difference is, and I'm playing the other side, but people are saying when a guy comes up to the organization and you pay to keep him like Jeter, it's different. 
[00:25:30]  They're saying the Yankees went out and just grabbed big names or already big names and overpaid them.  Jeter, Rivera, nobody would ever question what they're paid because they were started with the Yankees.  No.  So they're saying they're going out and grabbing big names.  I don't know what they're paying Sabathia, what they're paying Burnett's.  I mean, AJ Burnett, they're paying a lot of money, though, I'm sure.  Probably a few bucks.  A couple of shekels.  They perform.  They perform.  They're good at what they do.  I mean, it's not...  It's just like anything else. 
[00:26:00]  Jimmy, you can go afford things that I can't, that I would like to have.  You think there's any other team that would turn their nose up at a Sabathia or a Jeter or an A-Rod?  Hell no.  Other teams can't afford them.  And the Yankees lost Pettit and Clemens to the Astros, and they offered more money for both of them, and they lost both of them.  So, you know, it happens sometimes where the money doesn't help you, but...  That Clemens signing was fucking embarrassing the last time around.  Oh, my gosh.  They didn't know at the time. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  They didn't know at the time.  That was the only good thing that came of it, was fucking listening to that bitch babble.  Clemens gave a very emotional announcement from George's box that I was really blown away by.  Yeah.  Everyone in the dugout was going crazy.  It was madness.  Okay, one person was smiling, I think.  Passada's fiddling with a safety pin.  Really amazing.  Passada's painting his fingernails white so the picture could see him.  Yeah, Joe Torre's scratching his prostate.  Guys, very sad news.  We lost the listener because he can't deal with all the sports talk, and he's going to octane until 7, and he hopes that we're not talking about sports when he comes back. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, so sorry.  It's only the fucking World Series, you cunt.  Oh.  Let's say hi to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey.  Hey, good morning, Opie.  Anthony, happy birthday.  What's up, Brian?  All right.  Well, you guys were talking about having to wait nine years to get a championship like it's a horrible thing, but Philadelphia had to wait 125 years before they won World Series No. 1 in 1980. 
[00:27:30]  Well, yep.  That's a long time.  That's a while.  That's a very long time.  Nine years is a long time for the Yankees to, you know, kind of suck.  Well, considering they bought all the best players, you shouldn't have to wait nine years.  Yeah, exactly.  Let me say hi to Jack in South Carolina.  Jack.  Hey, fellas.  Great show.  I didn't know XM had a new sports channel.  I'm really glad to be listening to it.  One thing, though, real quick. 
[00:28:00]  All the other sports leagues, especially football and basketball, have a salary cap.  So, when you do spend a lot of money on the quote-unquote best players and they fail, you're really penalized for a long time because you only have a certain amount of money to spend.  That's one of the advantages that the Yankees do have.  They can spend the money, and if it doesn't work out, they can just go ahead and spend money somewhere else.  Yeah, that's true.  And also, in other sports, you've got to be really careful before you give up so much money for one player.  That's a very good parent.  Good parent.  Okay, well, so the small market teams, like the Pittsburgh Steelers, spend very wisely, and they win a lot of championships. 
[00:28:30]  The Pittsburgh Pirates, they can't financially compete with these bigger teams, though.  I also, look, I hated a lot of the big spendings.  I despised it.  I didn't want those.  I never wanted, I didn't want A-Rod.  I was actually wrong because he's been there for a few years now.  I didn't want him.  I never wanted fucking Randy Johnson.  I never wanted Sheffield.  Who are some of the big guys in the last, say, five or six years?  Kevin Brown. 
[00:29:00]  Kevin Brown.  That motherfucker.  I hated Kevin Brown.  I believe he was with Texas before that, and Brown and Rogers used to beat the shit out of the Yankees.  I never wanted that fucking bag of shit in a Yankee uniform, in his bad back.  Never.  All right, let's go to Tony in Philly.  Tony!  Ron Bennington should have punched you in the face.  Cliff Lee's going to fuck you Yankee faggots in the mouth.  I like that.  Well.  I like your pizzazz.  I like your spunk, kid.  Hey, Tony, hope you got your fucking towel.  Yeah, swing it in a circle, in a circular fashion.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Swing your towels now in a circle.  Everyone do it.  Ooh.  We're rallying, guys.  Oh, boy, did that shut them the fuck up.  Yuck.  God damn.  Oh, that ninth inning was great when those towels just stopped spinning, and the people  were just resting their heads in their hands with the towel.  Crying into them.  I hope the Yankees bring props into their fucking ballpark next year.  No, it just wouldn't be accepted.  It wouldn't be accepted by the fans. 
[00:30:00]  It just wouldn't fucking be accepted.  It's not a prop, but, oh, the angels with their fucking thunder sticks.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And the rally monkeys and the hat.  Hey.  Fruity L.A. would do that.  Hey, relax with the Met hat thing.  It's just a big fucking stupid prop.  Put the hat in a funny way.  It's a prop thing that takes the place of the fact that you can't just sit there and  enjoy your team winning, and people aren't out buying a lot of merchandise, so they gotta 
[00:30:30]  force this shit down their throats.  How terrible would it be if they didn't retire Rivera's number, like, say he left, and they  just gave it to some guy, you know, Shep Peters.  He was, like, a utility infielder.  Shep Peters batted 117 through the regular season.  Yankees are not going to be able to hold back the thunder sticks another year or two.  Thunder sticks are going to be taking over.  You think a year or two there's going to be thunder sticks all over Yankee Stadium?  They're going to be everywhere.  They're going to take over the sports world. 
[00:31:00]  Stop.  Because they're fun for everyone, Ian.  I love the two-out, full-count, fucking, everyone-stands-up-now thing that every other  team is doing.  And meanwhile, it was started in Yankee Stadium.  Yeah, like the Ron Guidry days.  That's another one that, yeah.  All right, you're right.  Yankees, greatest sports franchise ever.  Thank you.  And no one will ever come close to what they have done.  Fucking tradition over the years.  You could say all the spending things and stuff, but now let's go back to the fucking  50s and talk about that. 
[00:31:30]  What?  Same thing?  Ooh.  What about the wonderfulness of DiMaggio?  Huh?  Huh?  Was that a big deal?  Was that a big fucking, like, big deal?  It's just a tradition of greatness.  This team is amazing to me because of the way they've come back and won games.  Like, the last couple of games that they've won late in the game.  I'm impressed with this team a lot, man.  Last night's victory.  Sick.  I'm amazed that they won that game.  If you're a Philly fan watching last night's game, you, I know that feeling of disgust.  Three runs against your closer with two outs, nobody on, and two strikes. 
[00:32:00]  And that scrappy little fucking Native American face, Damon.  I don't know what nationality is.  Is he either Mexican or Native American?  Did you hear the crowd go, wah, when they thought he fucking struck out?  I thought he struck out.  I know.  It was the same place I went, fuck.  Yeah, he just barely tipped it down.  Like, oh, fuck.  And then he comes back around.  Let's count fucking able to do it.  Amazing.  Oh, Rivera wears Jackie Robinson's number, which he wore before Major League Baseball retired  for all the teams. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  So he's the only one still wearing that number?  Still wearing that number.  I didn't know that.  That's a little trivia coming in.  Is that true, Jeff?  Did not know that.  Jeff in Jersey, is that true?  We're going to look that one up.  Nick in Cleveland.  What's up, Nick?  Well, his will be retired for Rivera.  I don't want it retired for Jackie.  I want it retired for fucking Rivera.  Jackie was great, but Rivera's done more for the game.  Sorry, black people.  I think Jackie Robinson wins that one every single time.  No, he doesn't.  He does not let Jackie Robinson fucking throw all those shutout innings.  I think not.  All he did was show up and get fucking pelted and cause trouble. 
[00:33:00]  It's true, by the way.  I'm sure it is.  Okay, let me say hi to Nick in Cleveland.  Nick.  Gentlemen, I just want to make a point, though, for the little guys here.  Sabathia was opening up the book for Sabathia.  He pitched in game one against Cliff Lee, who won the Stuyall Award for Cleveland.  The year after Sabathia won the Stuyall Award for Cleveland.  You can't tell us that these small market teams have a chance to compete.  We had to watch both our pitchers play against each other.  We could have held on to these guys if we had some goddamn money. 
[00:33:30]  Who wants to watch small market teams in the World Series?  Just stop already.  Just the small market teams.  Who wants?  Do you think they're going to get the ratings they're getting with the Yankee-Philly World Series?  But they don't give a shit about that anyway.  Because the Yankees, they've got so much money.  They can throw so much shit out there and see what's fixed.  Like you guys say, oh, they didn't win shit for like nine years.  But they were in a playoff every year except for one.  That's a good point.  I mean...  A couple balls go their way, and they've got a couple more World Series. 
[00:34:00]  You guys act like they were in last place every single year because they bought a bunch of fucking tomato cans.  That's a good point, though.  Watching fucking your two players...  Watching those two players face off in the World Series.  But look, the Expos dealt with that for years.  All the Expos are a bad example because Montreal is not a baseball town.  And they were doing 11,000 people a game, 10,000 people a game.  So they didn't deserve a team anymore.  Yeah, let's say hi to...  But Cleveland's a good baseball city.  Louis in Arizona.  Louis.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Louis.  There's a comedian.  I forget who said it, but he said, rooting for the Yankees to win the World Series is like hoping Bill Gates wins the lotto. 
[00:34:30]  I like it.  I kind of like it.  I bet they're a comedian from Cleveland.  From Florida.  Kind of like it.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's our sports break.  Well, we got a little football action we could talk about, too.  Oh, true.  Oh, yes.  Brett Favarara.  Brett Favarara.  We were all wondering how he would be received returning to Green Bay in a Vikings uniform. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, it was a big deal when he ran onto the Lambeau Field for the first time.  And I don't know.  I heard, like, a lot of boos and some cheers, probably.  Was it the booze cheers thing?  Probably more boos.  Yeah?  Yeah, I believe more boos.  Those assholes booed that guy?  Well, it sure did get to him, I guess, because, wow, did he play like crap.  Yeah, he sure did, Anthony.  Oh, Jesus.  He sure did.  Oh, did they fucking kill him?  Vikings 38, Packers 26.  How do you boo that guy after all of the years of his life he gave you? 
[00:35:30]  You fucking Midwest dummies.  Jeez, Ed.  You fucking...  How do you boo a guy that played with you for, what, 15 years?  Through the good years and the bad years, and he comes back wearing another helmet with a fucking wing on it, and you boo him?  You're a bunch of jerk-offs.  It's a horn.  Whatever it is.  It's a Viking.  How do you boo that guy?  Jesus, what assholes?  Boo!  Oh, right.  Yeah, they were very angry with him, I guess.  Dopes.  Because they... 
[00:36:00]  You know what it was?  It's like a jealous bitch booing.  They're still in love with him, but they can't show that love.  They're all jealous.  Did they at least cheer him when he first came out?  No.  No, that's when the booze and the cheering and booze were happening.  Yeah.  I would love to find out for someone that was actually at the game.  On TV, it sounded like more booze than cheers, but you definitely heard some cheers in there.  How mad would they be if he went into the Hall of Fame as a Viking?  He's going in as a fucking... 
[00:36:30]  As a Packer.  It's a problem.  Oh, look.  A few years go by and then they'll welcome him back to Lambeau Field.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break into some other things?  Yes.  What are we working on today in the Opie and Anthony newsroom?  Well, we got...  I want to find out how your Halloween party was.  We'll talk about your Halloween party.  I don't remember.  If somebody can call and tell me what happened.  I was fucking...  I was obliterated.  We'll find out a little bit.  Well, I noticed Danny has a new look, so I'm sure something happened at the Halloween party. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Can we explain that?  Danny lost the get your hair cut and ass fucked bet.  And Warren Haynes is coming in today to jam a few songs for us.  I don't know who he is.  I know the name.  He's pretty much the main guy in the Allman Brothers now.  Government mule.  Fucking knows how to play that goddamn guitar.  The guitar?  Plays the guitar?  Is it just going to be bluesy stuff?  He's going to jam for us today. 
[00:37:30]  You like the Allman Brothers?  What's wrong with you?  I like the Allman Brothers when it's like...  He's playing like Dickie Betts' part, basically.  Well, that's what he does now.  Well, no, that's more of that blunt, but...  But that's the type of thing he's doing.  He's doing like Dickie Betts.  Yeah.  All right.  Does he beat his wife?  Yeah, I think so.  Like Dickie?  I don't know.  Dickie was great.  Boy, when we were playing down in Asbury Park, we were doing a show down there, and Dickie  Betts was up on stage, and then we heard some commotion was going on, and apparently it was 
[00:38:00]  Dickie punching his wife in the face.  There might have been a few problems.  Yeah, there were a couple of problems going on there.  He was on our stage playing all these feel-good songs.  Little did we know he was beating the crap out of his wife in a hotel room before and  after the gig.  And it's documented.  It made the paper, so I don't think we're being outrageous on that statement.  No, no.  We saw the shit going down.  There were some shenanigans.  Oh, yeah.  All right, quick break.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:38:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Talking World Series.  Talking Halloween.  Talking about a lot of stuff.  Football, not so much.  Stupid Jets.  Losing to the Dolphins.  I think your Cowboys won, though, Jimmy.  Yeah, I think 38-17 or something.  Was that the final there?  I didn't watch that.  38-17 over the Seahawks.  You're right.  And the Giants took a beating from the Eagles. 
[00:39:00]  40-17.  More football scores on the way.  But you already know if your team won or not.  Hey, in elementary school, we love these little stories.  It's a quickie.  Elementary school has Happy Costume Day, so they don't offend anyone.  Yeah.  So instead of calling it Happy Halloween, they call it Happy Costume Day.  How does Happy Halloween offend some people?  That's the first thing I thought.  Like, why is that offensive?  Does anyone know the answer to that?  Because no one really traces Halloween back to the Wiccan custom of, you know, 
[00:39:30]  All Hallows' Eve, where the spirits...  No one fucking thinks about that.  It's become something where kids come to your door and ask for candy,  and you have parties and you dress up silly.  Silly!  Did kids come to your house this year?  Well, Ope...  Oh, what the fuck did you do?  Well, let me tell you what happened.  It's never good when you go,  Well, Ope!  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Well, again, there might have been, you know, a situation based on race. 
[00:40:00]  But it started out where I got home Friday.  If you remember our show, our fantastic hysterical show Friday.  You're talking about the show that was shut down by middle management?  Exactly.  You're talking about the show that was shut down by a bunch of rookies?  Even being shut down...  You're talking about the show that was shut down by guys that are half our age?  That show?  Hysterically funny.  I don't want to work with rookies!  Oh, shit.  Now that I got that out of the way, what were you saying, Anthony? 
[00:40:30]  Hysterical show.  Yeah.  Even with any of the limitations, we're brilliant and we can, you know...  Oh, we worked around it.  Of course.  Overcome.  But you know something?  Physically, mentally exhausted when we're done.  Exhausted.  Yes.  And the fact that I slept for 40 minutes the night before made me even more tired Friday.  So Friday...  Well, you sleep like a vampire now.  You know that.  Yes!  You sleep during the day.  In a coffin.  I'm very tired.  So I go home and it's about noon-ish and I decide to take a little nap. 
[00:41:00]  The little nap lasted until about 5.30 in the afternoon.  Six hours.  Six hour nap.  Because now it's Friday and I want to be able to stay up, you know, for the weekend.  I get up.  I do the same thing now.  Party, hang out.  Now I figure Saturday, Halloween party.  So I just Twitter it.  I go, and my Twitter was, anybody...  Because this was like a last minute kind of put together thing, but I knew I kind of wanted 
[00:41:30]  to do something, but I wasn't sure.  So I just Twittered and said, anyone who knows or has been to my place and has not been kicked  out.  Is invited?  Is invited.  That's nice.  It's one of those things.  Wait, I'm confused.  Did you give out candy or not?  Here's where it comes in.  Where are you?  I am weaving my way in.  All right.  Let's go.  So then I do the same thing.  I sleep very late and I'm awakened to the doorbell. 
[00:42:00]  On Saturday, which would be Halloween.  Yes, but it again is about five o'clock in the afternoon.  Okay.  Gotcha.  And now I'm being woken up by children that want candy.  That want candy.  And you don't have candy, do you?  No, no.  I had candy.  Ange bought some candy.  She left it there.  So I had to get up.  And it was fine, you know.  I went to the door.  Lots of little children from the neighborhood.  Don't you pay someone to go to the door for you?  No, I was alone.  I figured what the fuck.  Because you hate kids.  Why would you give out candy to kids on Halloween? 
[00:42:30]  Because Ange bought the candy.  It was there.  It's Halloween.  Well, tell her to give out the candy.  And I didn't want my house egged.  So I figured I better start handing out some fucking grub for these little bastards.  And I had good candy.  You know, full-size candy bars and shit like that.  None of those little snack pack craps.  Things like that.  So I'm handing the candy out.  And then into the evening when some of the people start coming over for the party,  they're still trick-or-treaters.  So whoever was upstairs saw the candy thing and just answered the door and decided what?  And I think it was, was it Newsday Laura who came downstairs and said, 
[00:43:00]  Well, you're out of candy.  You go, Well, what happened?  She goes, Well, a couple of kids came up with their mother.  Black kids, obviously.  And, well, I didn't know this at the time.  It was a couple of kids came up with their mother.  And cleaned you out.  I was like, What do you mean, clean me out?  Well, I put the tray in front.  Because this is all I was doing.  Every little kid would come and their parents are there.  And I go, Go ahead, take what you want.  And usually they take a couple of things. 
[00:43:30]  And then at one point a father went like, Okay, that's enough.  Thank you.  You're supposed to give them candy and just throw it in their stupid candy sack.  That used to piss me off when I'd go to a house and I'd see all this goodness of candy.  And then they would give me shit.  So I decided I'd let the kids pick out what they want.  So they do that.  But apparently, again, the fucking arm swipe that is oh so popular with certain ethnic groups. 
[00:44:00]  The fucking kid took his arm, his forearm, and swiped half the fucking thing into his bag.  That's what he should have done when a dopey white lady held out the candy and said, Take what you want.  You know something?  You know, maybe a little fucking decorum and a little restraint.  He did.  He didn't take her purse.  He just took her fucking candy.  She gave it to him.  Yeah, it could have been a lot worse.  Then the second kid proceeds to pretty much take the rest and leaves like a couple of things.  Then the fat ass fucking mother comes over and grabs what was left. 
[00:44:30]  That's right.  So you were robbed, basically.  Pretty much robbed.  Were you mugged?  Robbed on Halloween.  You were mugged of your Halloween candy?  Of candy.  Yeah, that was it.  Like, what the fuck, man?  You can't just take a couple of things.  It's got to be, ooh, look, a whole goddamn thing.  I'm going to take it all.  Don't try to pin the blame on me.  I've seen this happen every goddamn year.  It started in Great Neck, remember?  Stupid blacks, right?  I didn't say that. 
[00:45:00]  I'm saying that a few bad apples ruin it.  You know?  You know what you should give out?  Every year I give out Smarties.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Stupid Smarties.  The kids love Smarties.  They make your jaw hurt if you're in the show shower.  Necco wafers.  Necco wafers.  Oh, those are worse.  I don't mind the Smarties.  The Necco wafers, though.  I love Smarties.  I saw what Uncle Paul did with the Necco wafers, too.  He dresses like a priest and then makes believe he's giving communion with the Necco wafers.  And then once the kid's on their knees, oh boy. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, look.  Here's the little slipper for the Necco wafers.  Body of Paul.  I think that's your fault, Dan.  You should have been giving out the candy.  What?  You don't know these little bastards.  You'd say that, well, you look very nice and then you plop some candy into their thing.  Look, let me tell you something.  Okay.  And I'm not blaming Newsday Laura for this.  Especially if you have all good candy to begin with.  Here it is.  I'm not blaming Newsday Laura for this.  She wasn't familiar with the situation.  If I had gone upstairs and seen the situation, I then would have just doled out a few candy bars. 
[00:46:00]  You would have adjusted.  I would have adjusted to whom was at the door.  When I see someone that I feel are going to be candy hooligans.  Are you saying they were busting in the black kids because they knew this neighborhood had some good candy?  I don't know where they come from.  Not in my neighborhood.  There was a lot of black kids coming to your door?  No.  Not a lot.  Just enough.  Just enough to wipe all my candy.  Just saying. 
[00:46:30]  It just makes everyone look bad.  Stop doing that.  It's every year I've got a fine other fucking audio of me having problems every fucking Halloween.  Stop doing it like that.  Just have them hand out.  But I try to be nice and think, you know something, maybe this year I'm going to get a different result.  And the kid's going to go, thank you.  And just take a couple of things and not swipe the whole fucking thing.  Like it's a goddamn surveillance tape and a jewelry store.  How many kids?  But you don't care. 
[00:47:00]  I really don't care.  You don't care.  I actually find it funny.  You care that it was done by a minority.  If it was a white kid that did that, you'd be like, eh, whatever.  I thank God it happened again because it just gives me more fuel to scream.  You're right.  But no, the little, the little, um, a lot of little Jewish children in the neighborhood because I live in a very predominantly Jewish community.  Um, very nice, you know, dressed in their little costumes.  Nice.  A little princess, a little Superman, the witch.  Let's say hi to Riley in Baltimore. 
[00:47:30]  Riley.  Hey, Ant, this is what you need to do.  I've got two candy trays.  And when the little schlugs come around, I give them my kids Easter candy that they didn't eat from last year.  Oh, see, that's awful.  That isn't, I don't want to, uh, to, uh, discriminate in that way.  Bullshit!  No, I don't.  That's why the tray goes out and, and I treat every child the same regardless of, uh, race, creed, or color. 
[00:48:00]  And, uh, for some reason, certain races, creeds, and colors, uh, act differently than others when it comes to...  Hold on!  I wasn't ready for that statement.  Uh, take, I'm sorry, I keep going.  I didn't listen to you.  I was taking the candy.  What were you saying?  I said I am equal, uh, as far as my candy distribution...  You're a liar!  ...with, uh, race, creeds...  Goddamn liar!  ...and color.  Get out again!  I treat them all the same.  Get out again!  I don't want them to think, uh, I'm doing anything differently...  You're a liar!  ...with them than I am doing with any other race of child... 
[00:48:30]  Goddamn liar!  ...that comes to my door.  Shut up!  You're a phony!  Hey, this guy's a great big phony!  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right!  You're a big fat phony!  Is that Regan's...  Uh, it sounds like it, but it's, uh...  I think it's from Family Guy, right?  Which character?  I don't...  I don't...  It was a peripheral guy.  It wasn't like a main person.  Okay.  That Cleveland show sucks.  That's not good.  What are you doing? 
[00:49:00]  Just give me new Family Guy episodes.  What the fuck are they doing with that spin-off shit?  Well, yeah, what is that?  Huh?  I'm not a big fan of American Dad, either.  No, not me.  That's another Seth MacFarlane production.  But out of all the characters on Family Guy, Cleveland isn't the guy I'm thinking, wow,  he needs a spin-off.  This is the funny one.  I don't get that one.  No.  I think anybody else probably would have worked out better.  I mean, I would much prefer to watch a Quagmire show.  Oh, Quagmire would...  Quagmire would probably be the number one I would see as a spin-off.  Why did they make Joanie Loves Chachi and not just make a show called The Fonz? 
[00:49:30]  The Fonz probably wouldn't do it, whereas Joanie did love Chachi, and Charles had gotten  bigger.  We wanted to see how that relationship would pan out.  Ah.  All right.  Now it makes sense.  Thanks.  Apparently, there was a lot of felching with Jenny Piccolo.  Haunted me for years.  I had a really kind of a weird moment, because I was doing the Halloween thing down in Philly.  Yeah.  Sitting on a stoop.  With the neighbors.  Yeah.  They all kind of get together.  They're in a cul-de-sac, so everyone's on their stoop. 
[00:50:00]  Sounds so Philly.  It was cool, actually.  Because we had to escape New York, because the problem is, living on the 40th floor in  Manhattan on Halloween, you can't leave your building.  You're hostage.  Really?  You're held hostage until Halloween's over, because they take over the elevators and stop  on every single floor.  Oh, my God.  You literally cannot leave.  Unless you want to walk down 40 floors, that's an option.  I didn't even think of that.  What a nightmare.  So we...  Thanks.  We left New York, went down to Philly, and doing the stoop Halloween thing, giving out  the candy, having fun, drinking some beers, talking sports and whatnot. 
[00:50:30]  And this kid comes up, a large kid, with a limp.  And my wife's mother asked the kid, what's wrong with your leg?  And stupid me, I did not hear the answer.  So she got the answer, very discreetly.  Yeah.  And I go, hey, what's wrong with that kid's leg?  Oh, no.  What's wrong with the kid's leg?  I didn't hear what he said.  Prosthetic.  Because I'm fucking deaf from all these years of radio. 
[00:51:00]  And the kid said, but he whispered it to the, you know, my girl's mom.  Oh, no.  That he has a bad leg because he has special needs.  It's special needs.  What are his special needs?  He's a special need kid.  Is he retarded or is he crippled?  Everyone has special needs.  Why are you getting mad?  The kid has a bum leg because he's a little slow.  Those things don't tie in.  Retardation does not tie in with a bum leg.  He has special needs.  And so he has a bad leg.  I just, I don't know what that means. 
[00:51:30]  And I was yelling it as the family was walking away because I didn't get the answer.  I didn't hear the answer.  You were right to yell it.  You should have yelled it out the window at him.  I didn't hear you.  Get back, you bum.  Oh, no.  He heard it because I kept saying, what's wrong with his leg?  And everyone was shushing me because I didn't know.  I thought he broke his foot playing sports or something.  Soccer.  I don't know.  Let's go to Dave in Baton Rouge.  Hey, Dave.  Dave.  Yeah, morning, guys.  What's up?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, Dave.  Did Hank get home invaded by like an eight-year-old? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, it was a candy home invasion.  What happened to all the gun talk and stuff?  You think you would control your environment?  I'm not firing on children at my door on Halloween.  Take the candy.  But you can't even control seven or eight-year-olds.  You've got to read up on the use of deadly physical force.  It does not say to protect your candy.  You should control the situation.  It's your home, my friend.  All I had as far as decorations for my Halloween party were these cool range targets that are 
[00:52:30]  Nazi zombies with crosshairs and stuff on them.  Sure.  Stuff like that.  So those were hanging up all over the house as the only decorations I had.  No real decor.  Just everybody down at the bar having a little fun.  We got in some karaoke.  The bar, by the way, Ange, if she's listening, holy shit.  Disaster area.  Yeah.  Just be prepared.  The house itself is a wreck. 
[00:53:00]  Is it really?  It was fine when I left.  It was fine when after you left.  We kept drinking.  Why don't you take pictures of that?  That's the type of stuff I want to see on Twitter.  Yeah.  Let me go to Gary in Boston before we get into your Halloween party talk.  Because I want to find out what the fuck happened to Danny over there.  Gary, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  You're the balls, gun.  Hey, I wanted to let you know, I had been doing the same thing you were doing, putting 
[00:53:30]  the candy out on the stoop, letting the kids come up, pick their own stuff.  Well, they were doing the same thing here in South Boston, doing the same exact thing,  just swiping as much as they possibly can.  So this year, I decided to do something a little different.  I decided just to hand it out like normal.  Yeah.  I had this kid of a certain ethnic group come up wearing a ghost outfit and ask for candy  like normal.  I went to hand him the candy and he stepped back and looked at me and he goes, are you  fucking kidding me? 
[00:54:00]  What a bastard.  Why did he say that?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I guess I didn't give him enough candy.  I guess my whole handful, my adult size handful was not enough for him.  Why doesn't everyone just keep their candy that they buy for Halloween and call it a day  instead of like, all you're doing is switching off candy.  You know what I mean?  All the houses buy candy for the kids going to their door, but then send their kids out  for Halloween to get candy.  Can't you cut out like the middleman there?  Should be able to. 
[00:54:30]  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seems all very strange to me.  Let me say hi to Ryan in New York.  Ryan.  Hey, how's it going?  Go Phillies, buddy.  Go Phillies.  I lost the costume contest to a 12-year-old with half an arm.  With half an arm?  Yeah.  She had one of them little stumpy things with two fingers at the end.  Ah, that's built in.  Oh, yeah.  She waits all year for Halloween.  That was my whole ball bill, man.  Tough loss.  Do the amputees out there make really good Halloween costumes? 
[00:55:00]  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  Like make zombie arms and shit?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I've never seen that in all my years where someone takes advantage of their handicap.  The fact that they're missing a limb and make it into, you know, something cool for their  costume.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen one for real?  No.  No.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Nope.  Thank you, Ryan.  So the Halloween party was good.  Jimmy went.  Yeah.  Any highlights?  It was, no, it was all lowlights.  It was just kind of hanging out. 
[00:55:30]  A lot of drinking.  Wow.  A lot of drinking.  More than usual?  Put it this way.  We ran out of all of our kegged beer.  It was pretty much done.  Had to make a run to the-  Did you have like two solid full kegs when you started?  No, but there was beer left, believe me.  Yeah.  And I had to make a run for some bottled beer and then the booze also.  And then I started doing shots and then I didn't even realize who the fuck was giving  me tequila.  God damn it.  Well, you see, there actually is somebody who could drink more than D-Boy. 
[00:56:00]  And he's managed to acquire her as his girlfriend.  Wait, what happened?  Derek's chick drinks.  More than Derek?  Wow.  Way more than Derek.  Was that her that was there?  Way more than Derek?  She's a pisser, man.  She is a pisser, that one.  Holy shit.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can she?  Wow.  She pretty much drank an entire bottle of Patron.  Pretty much.  I was like, I was doing a shot.  I go, look, don't give me a shot that I'm going to go like, uh, and wince. 
[00:56:30]  I'm drinking all night.  I don't want something a little tasty and, uh, I don't want to pass out, you know?  So she's like, ah, fuck you.  Drink it, motherfucker.  Like, all right.  So, so I drink it.  I'm like, that was like straight vodka or something.  She goes, vodka, it's tequila.  She's like, oh, wow.  Great.  I haven't had tequila in 20 years because last time I ended up on the bathroom floor with  the tile marks in my face when I woke up.  God bless you.  No, it was fantastic.  So I ended it after that.  Patron's a lot different, though, than regular tequila. 
[00:57:00]  Jimmy, any observations from the big Halloween party?  No, it was pretty mellow.  It was basically, uh, people in different rooms watching the Yankee game.  Yeah.  Than was there.  Yeah, Than showed up.  It was a very polite gathering.  Yeah.  Um, I just kind of sat there quietly, uh, chit-chat with Big A a little bit and, uh,  a couple of Anthony's police friends.  Yes.  And, um, my girlfriend was talking to a couple other girls and, uh, just yapping away.  Yeah.  Jimmy's like, about what?  Anything, man?  Just chit-chatting.  Girls know how to yap.  They're yapping.  Just, they're good.  Women are great at, like, talking. 
[00:57:30]  Just yapping.  Yapping.  They just know how to keep a conversation going.  You get a bunch of us in the room and we just look at each other, like, talk about sports  for a few minutes, talk about some fine asses, and then we have nothing else to talk about.  Big A came to the, uh, party with a scream mask on that didn't cover his nose.  Did he really?  It's, I swear, it was so small on his face that it was ridiculous.  Yeah.  And, uh, he, we got him to sing a little karaoke. 
[00:58:00]  We got him to sing, stayin' alive.  I saw the, I saw the video.  He was terrific.  Oh, it's tragic.  It was a great time.  He had fun.  Everyone was, uh, you know, drinking.  Like I said, the bar's a disaster, uh, right now.  But, um, it was fun.  I had a good time.  Where's pictures from the party?  Yeah, where is everyone?  Ah, there I am in my usual get-up. 
[00:58:30]  You're one of the three musketeers?  My little three musketeers outfit.  You're one of the musketeers?  Of course.  Why wouldn't I be?  It's the only costume I have.  I was going to go as like an urban militant kind of guy, but I do that every day.  You got to get the bar cleaned up for the big baseball game tonight.  Nah, just get the bar.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Angie's coming over.  She'll take care of it and then mess it up again.  And tonight, with some more drinking and merriment.  But no, it was pretty cool. 
[00:59:00]  I think the whole night wrapped up at about 6.30 in the morning.  That's not bad.  With a showing of Dawn of the Dead in the theater with Ving Rhames and shit.  I like that one.  Wow.  I left like five hours before the party was over.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm such an old lady.  It was just nothing but more bad karaoke, drinking, and movies.  The party was just beginning when you left, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Fast times.  How many people made it to the end? 
[00:59:30]  Um, well, finally.  No, I know.  No, it was about, um, I don't know, four, five people left.  About it.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Amazing.  And then, uh...  And Danny, why is Danny, uh...  Woke up the next day at about five o'clock in the afternoon again, yesterday.  Just in time for the Yankee game.  Yeah.  Why is Danny all clean cut?  There's no facial hair.  He has no hair.  There's Halloween costume.  Well, if you look at, uh, Halloween costume, uh, there online, Danny was the perfect Carl 
[01:00:00]  from Sling Blade.  Uh, and he goes the distance.  Like, if you remember last year, uh, he was Doc Brown, and that's why he had his hair like  that.  Uh, it was, it painted white, and, uh, it was his hair as Doc Brown.  This year, he shaved it exactly like Carl, uh, I still have it exactly like Carl.  It's still just like Carl.  He's got the Carl Sling Blade hairdo. 
[01:00:30]  And he had the big dicky pants on with the, they were too short with the boots and the  bad button-down shirt.  The extra, extra large blue button-down shirt.  Yeah, yeah, blue button-down shirt, and he had some books, uh, that he carried around  with him.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, he had a belt of his books.  Yeah, yeah, it was, it was really good.  And, uh, yeah, you got the facial expressions down.  And then, uh, it was, it was cool, because he'd be like, Carl, could I have a beer?  And Carl would get, mm-hmm, you did the boy.  I'd ask people if they want the biggin'. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You want the biggin'?  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  He's a little loud.  Let me see.  He's over at Bill Cox's bar.  Let's go to Joe in Georgia.  Joe.  Hey, it's Sean, but, uh, I got a quick question.  If Danny shaved his head, does that mean that Sam won Afro Wars?  Ah.  I think Afro Wars, even though we ended it at least two years ago, is finally, officially  over, because it was down to Sam and Danny, and Danny shaved everything off to, uh, you 
[01:01:30]  know, get into the Carl mystique.  Let me be the first to congratulate Sam on growing his hair for a longer amount of time  than me.  You are the winner.  Sam!  Wow.  By the way, I know what I want Sam to do with his hair.  What?  I want Sam.  Why isn't Sam in here?  He ran down the hall.  By the way, I saved my hair.  It's in a bag at my house.  Oh, really?  So, yeah, we can figure out something to do with that.  Give to a chance for people.  Fuck them.  Sam!  Oh, my God.  Get your own hair.  I can't hear it. 
[01:02:00]  Where is, where's that little fucker?  Sam, Danny just congratulated you.  You officially have one.  I didn't know what was going on, because I was asking Kenny, are they still talking about  me, or did they move right on?  And Kenny didn't know, because he's listening to Jay-Z outside in the hallway.  Why didn't you listen to Jay-Z, right?  Were you a cheese eater?  No, I...  You're a cheese-eating rat.  I'm not a rat, but I want...  Thank you for the congratulations.  Last man standing in Afro Wars.  I told you from the beginning, it'd be me.  It was me. 
[01:02:30]  Danny, you are a very formidable opponent.  You've persevered.  Now...  Here's what I want to...  I want Sam to do something with his hair, though.  I was just going to say that.  Are you going to cut your hair now that Afro Wars is over?  Why?  Now there's no reason.  No.  Yeah, why?  To remind people who won.  So people actually...  No, see, that's not...  No, no, you don't do that.  No, I'm like...  You won.  I think Sam should be forced to cut it.  I want a Ben Franklin do.  I want a shoehorn in the middle with Ben Franklin do in the back. 
[01:03:00]  If you really love this radio show, that's what you'll do with your hair.  You have very unique hair.  There's a lot we can do with it as far as sculpting and like that.  I like Ben Franklin.  I'm going to vote for Pennywise the Clown.  Oh, Pennywise.  Yeah.  You get a picture of Pennywise.  Who, the Tim Curry character?  Mm-hmm.  No, I think it can do more for the show.  That's why it keeps growing.  It's going to keep going.  Yeah.  Yes.  Just beat Reg.  Oh, my God. 
[01:03:30]  That would be great.  You could do Pennywise really well.  I could.  Could you do Pennywise for us?  When the time comes.  Time's here.  Should we be red?  Red and bald on top.  Yeah, with a big white face.  Yeah.  It's very scary.  Yeah, we got to make it to Pennywise.  Ugh.  That's frightening.  Yeah, he does look scary.  I didn't like him as Pennywise, though.  All right, so there you go.  Breaking News, Sam wins Afro Wars.  Danny had a good Halloween costume.  Ant's party was good. 
[01:04:00]  Do you think everybody's been on the edge of their seat for the entire Afro Wars wondering  who will win?  Wherever I went, people were asking me about it.  Really?  Was it everywhere you went?  Everywhere.  It was just crazy.  I couldn't even do my day-to-day stuff.  Yeah.  All they want to know is about Afro Wars.  That's awesome.  And no more highlights from the party?  No, it's kind of, you know, got to be there kind of a thing.  It's one thing to describe a bunch of drunks wailing into microphones and drinking much  too much, but it was fun.  I had a good time. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, that's about that.  All right.  We could take a break and get into some other things.  And where it's got to eat.  Yeah.  Yo.  I got a tinkle.  It's 7.30 already?  7.30 already.  Warren Haynes coming into jam for us today.  What's he going to do?  Soul Shine, I think?  Didn't he say he was doing Soul Shine?  I am.  Yeah.  Not sure.  What soul is he doing?  Is Steve here today?  Nope.  Where's he?  Hey.  Oh, it's Monday.  Even though we joked about how Steve's not going to take Mondays off anymore, he still 
[01:05:00]  takes a lot of the Mondays off, by the way.  I went to the Halloween parade in the village.  It was a lot of fun, but I can't sit down.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, before we move on from Halloween, there was something we wanted to do on Friday's  show, but quite frankly, after they shut us down, we just didn't feel like doing anything  else.  We were tinking. 
[01:05:30]  Hey.  You weren't bothered by the shutdown on Friday, Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was bothered because they're rookies and they don't understand that we understand the  rules, and they had to put their fucking noses into our bit.  And, you know, we were second away from Sandy Cain sucking off Bobo.  Yeah.  That's how stupid they are.  Come on.  Sandy Cain wasn't going to suck off Bobo.  Yeah, please.  Sandy Cain has seen some fucking horror shows in her life, and she was freaked out by Bobo  and his tiny little penis. 
[01:06:00]  She blew Tippy Tom and looked at Bobo and said no.  God, she did blow Tippy Tom.  How does that happen?  Did she blow Tippy Tom?  Yes.  Wait, did she actually blow him?  Yeah, she was jacking him off, and then she sucked his dick for a little while.  Really?  Yep.  Nice dick, man.  Right.  The video's pretty good when you tell Bobo to put his fucking pants back on.  Yeah, put your fucking pants on.  I know.  It was just awfully degrading and dirty.  Look, it wasn't one of our greatest bits. 
[01:06:30]  I'll be the first to say that, but management's got to stay down the fucking hole.  We've been at this a long time.  Yeah.  For real.  For real.  Because I tell Blatter some of this shit, you know, eh, whatever.  But then there's real shit, and this is real shit.  Stay far away from us.  Yeah.  Just stay down there.  Do some spreadsheets.  Spreadsheets.  They were running in notes.  How long have you been doing radio, you clowns?  I think I've worked to do. 
[01:07:00]  TPS reports.  I don't know who the other guy is.  I mean, I know who he is, but I don't know.  He seems nice enough.  Whatever.  Yeah, management's always nice.  Whatever.  How come we don't see Steve Blatter anymore?  Because he fucking bailed on us.  Did he?  He's done on the channel?  Huh?  Totally.  Well, he sort of oversees the channel, but he went back to running all the music channels.  So now we're left with a bunch of rookies.  A bunch of fucking rookies.  We all should be bothered by that.  I'm only bothered by the ball breaking about my fucking ads for my gigs and complaining 
[01:07:30]  about how often they play.  And it's like, come on.  That's part of my fucking thing here.  That's rookie shit is what I'm saying.  People should understand that.  Whatever.  Let's try to stay positive.  They got to just let us be a little wild in here.  They got to have a little faith and let us get a little wild.  Running notes in means you have no fucking idea what we do.  And you panicked.  You fucking panicked on us.  It's like, come on the air.  That's part of...  And then they don't want to come on the air. 
[01:08:00]  And then we're sitting here like, duh, duh, duh.  They blew the hatch.  They screwed the pooch.  Fucking rookies.  Got to deal with fucking rookies.  You got to be kidding me.  Anyway, the news.  We're doing a John and Kate Halloween thing.  That was so horrendous.  We want to squeeze this in on Friday, but we just bailed on everybody.  But we can play it today before we move on from Halloween.  Local news, it's an excuse to just put on a fucking costume for Halloween and act like a complete idiot. 
[01:08:30]  With no, like, humor behind it.  No creativity behind it.  No nothing.  Do they attempt to be funny?  If you ask these people, I don't even know which local news did this in New York.  And it's...  When we say local news, I mean, it's still New York City.  Yeah, it's New York.  There's a lot of fucking people listening to the local news here in the big city.  They did a John and Kate thing.  And if you ask them, they would say they fucking killed with this. 
[01:09:00]  We killed.  So, Jimmy, I want you to pay close attention to this.  I certainly will.  The one anchor was dressed up as Kate.  The other anchor was dressed up like John.  And then eight other people that worked for the news station, adults, were sitting around in a circle,  make them believe they were the eight kids of John and Kate.  Didn't we do one bit of theirs that was fucking horrible?  One John and Kate bit from the news guy where he was trying to improv and it was horrendous?  No, we were just watching it.  We weren't able to get it on the air. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, we didn't play it?  Okay.  No, we were yelling and screaming.  It was during a break.  We were watching this going bad.  You've got to be kidding me.  This is the news.  Here we go.  All right, it's 844 and I'm Kate Gosselin here with...  Hopefully he's here.  John?  Are you...  Where are you?  I hear you found religion today.  Did you find anything in our bank account?  Yeah, you know what?  I mean, first of all, I hear you have the kids there.  Hi, kids.  Hi, children.  Do you love daddy?  You know what, kids?  Do you love daddy more than mommy? 
[01:10:00]  Okay, well, you know what?  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing, Kate.  Where are you?  You know, that's okay.  I don't love you.  I don't love you anymore.  You know what?  I'm at the carousel.  Yeah, apparently.  Are you at the carousel with daddy?  Okay, here's what's going on.  Where's the rabbi?  Where's Rabbi Shmuley, John?  Is he at the carousel, too?  Rabbi Shmuley is on his way, okay, Kate?  Okay?  Now, he's going to help me better myself.  I'm going to get zen. 
[01:10:30]  I'm going to really, like, zen out over this weekend.  I'm going to lose some weight.  I'm going to get rid of this gut right here.  You know, this beer belly that I have.  And I'm going to start dressing a little more appropriate.  Stop wearing the Ed Hardy t-shirt and the jeans.  Although, I like these jeans because I love this patch right here.  You know, I spent a lot of time ironing this patch on my jeans.  You know what?  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Can you pipe down?  Mommy's on TV, all right?  Mommy's on TV right now.  I love you, babies.  He does these impersonations. 
[01:11:00]  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Horrid.  Yeah, that's the news.  Now, I didn't know they were doing SNL.  They decided to do SNL on Friday.  Yeah.  Because it was Halloween.  And not even a quick hit.  They were on and on.  Oh, enough. 
[01:11:30]  They had no game plan, by the way.  No.  They had no idea where they were going.  It was just spiraling down.  We'll wing it.  It's going to be fantastic.  Mommy's trying to do the right thing.  You know what?  And money.  You know what, Kate?  Money doesn't mean anything to me anymore.  Yeah.  You know what, John?  It doesn't.  It doesn't when your girlfriend's 22, John.  It doesn't.  But when you've got eight kids to cheat, it means a little something.  You know what?  Nothing you can say is going to hurt me because I'm zen, baby.  I'm zen now. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  You know what?  You're a balding middle-aged man, John.  And now our TV show is canceled.  Stop it.  I don't care.  You know what?  I'm going to have another show with Optimize.  You know what?  I'm hitting the gym.  I got a trainer.  I got a styling haircut with some Dior glasses to go with it.  I don't need a trainer.  I don't need a trainer.  Look at that.  They're clean.  They're well-fed.  Look at those potholes.  No.  They're like eight angels here.  You know what?  I don't need the rabbi because I got my own angels right here in person.  Maddie, keep it quiet over there.  That's okay because they've been replaced with my new family over here. 
[01:12:30]  My new family over here.  Yeah.  See?  Aren't they beautiful?  Yeah.  Isn't the baby beautiful?  You know what?  They're young enough to be your children, John.  Okay?  Well, they are.  You've been replaced, Kate.  Can they fit six babies inside their belly, John?  I don't think so.  All right?  That's a low blow.  That's just a low blow.  You know what?  Just let them know that Daddy still loves them even though they don't love Daddy anymore  because I'm better.  I'm a better man now. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  Well, you know what?  I'm going to get on the carousel and I'm going to have fun today because I'm all about  Zen these days and I'm spiritual with Shmuley.  You know what?  On that note, I'm going to wrap you, John.  See you later.  Eat your heart out.  Enjoy your time with Rabbi Shmuley.  All right.  Coming up on Good Day, New York.  I meant she got a laugh.  I'm coming up on Good Day.  She was better than he was.  At least she wasn't as bad as he was.  That was horrendous on both parts.  Now, at least she had some fucking a couple of good slams.  Some zingers?  Yeah.  He was horrible.  This wasn't a Tommy troop, though. 
[01:13:30]  This was a fucking local news program.  The news.  Let me say hi to Brandon in Virginia.  Brandy.  Brandon.  Jesus.  Brandon, what's up?  Did anyone else notice that John sounded a lot like Bob Kelly?  He kind of did.  I'm going to get in shape.  I'm going to lose the beer, guys.  I'm Zen.  You get your coffee.  You go on the carousel.  Boom.  You're having fun.  You know what, dude?  You have kids.  You know what, dude?  I got a good life.  Boom. 
[01:14:00]  I'm in love.  I got my kids.  You know what, dude?  So what?  I'm hanging out in a private plane.  So what?  It's Danes and not mine.  Boom.  I'm relaxed.  You know what, Dan?  I'm overfishing already.  It was a mini obsession.  Boom.  I hate myself like I should.  Is he overfishing?  He should be.  You know what, Dan?  I talk about it and boom.  Then I don't talk about it, dude.  Was he in here Friday?  I left the studio with Bob Kelly.  It was Thursday or Friday.  He goes, I got the next thing for us. 
[01:14:30]  Paintball.  Think about it.  No.  Like, what's there to think about?  It's fucking paintball.  It's cool.  I've never played paintball.  You reach a point, though.  But he has to make it bigger than life.  Paintball.  Think about it.  You reach a point where paintball kind of gets like, you know, it's for the young.  You give yourself a subdural hematoma.  This looks delicious.  A good fruit smoothie. 
[01:15:00]  You got a big pink smoothie there.  People who say their S's like that, like, it's just the greatest.  Like, you know, the giant people are calling sports radio and have that fucking side of  the mouth list.  Should have their fucking teeth knocked out with a rock.  You know what?  I just think that if the Mets aren't going to play better, we shouldn't support the team.  Why are you calling a radio show?  Text it.  Could we just have speech impediment people call our show for the rest of the morning?  Please.  Please.  Real speech impediments.  Let's go to Will in North Carolina. 
[01:15:30]  Will.  Hello, boys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Sammy.  Thanks, Will.  That fucking clip made me physically angry.  Listen to that shit.  How do they get away with that?  A news director will approve that, but you guys can't run a fucking skit and you actually  have talent?  That's bullshit.  Well, it's a Halloween thing.  You put a costume on, then you can do whatever the fuck you want, I guess.  It was weird.  I mean, the local news, they had a lot of weird stuff going on with their Halloween costumes. 
[01:16:00]  Someone's suggesting, is it Pat from Minaki?  I like it.  Oh, no.  It's Newsvember.  You know.  Newsvember.  They make fun of the news for the whole month and over.  Pat wasn't there at the party.  Why?  We called him.  He said he was feeling a bit under the weather.  Uh-oh.  I don't know what that means.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, what the fuck?  With his medical history, that's never good to hear.  I know.  Uh-oh.  To miss a party?  Like, come on.  Pat's at every fucking party.  We missed Pat from Minaki.  Pat from Minaki hates me, but I like him. 
[01:16:30]  Really?  Pat hates you?  He certainly does.  Why does he hate you?  Don't know.  Wow, that's weird.  Is that real, or?  I don't know.  What's going on?  Let me say hi to Drew in Alabama.  Drew keeps calling us.  What's up with you today, Drew?  Ah, shit.  It's my day off work.  I did a bunch of coke last night.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Drew.  I hate to be busting the balls.  When you shut down the crystal meth factory on Monday?  You fucking Alabama hillbilly fuck.  No, no, no.  Like Bill Burr says, I'm a warehouse worker, man. 
[01:17:00]  But listen.  Man.  Fucking.  Even they put that John and Kate plus eight shit on the news is to distract you from the  whole fucking fact that there's a whole war going on in the Middle East.  Oh, man.  If they put, yeah, man, yeah, exactly.  They put all that shit, they put all this bullshit to distract you with fucking Lindsay  Lohan, who hasn't had a job for five years.  They show a fucking pussy.  That makes fucking the news. 
[01:17:30]  They don't want to show you what's going on in the fucking Middle East.  I disagree with you, sir.  Hold on.  Here's why I don't agree with you.  Because we could get our news now if you really cared.  You could really go on the internet and find exactly what you're looking for.  And they don't have that kind of foresight to do that.  They're just knee-jerk reaction idiots.  And they want to be entertainers, most of them.  It's not like you have three news channels anymore with guys with integrity, whether it  was, you know, Rather and a few other guys or Cronkite.  These guys are all wannabe entertainers. 
[01:18:00]  So they want to be funny, they want to be entertaining, and that's what keeps people  watching, I guess.  But they're not doing it to distract you, dude.  They're too stupid to have that kind of foresight.  And in the days of, you know, we forget, we've always been fascinated with this horse  shit.  What was going on?  What was Joey Buttafuoco the distraction for?  What was the whole OJ fucking trial?  What was that a distraction from?  I mean, we're just fascinated with this horse shit, with celebrity and all that stuff.  So they know. 
[01:18:30]  Who are you talking about?  Who is fascinated?  The populace.  The populace.  If OJ fucking stabs a bitch, send the motherfucking dude to jail.  But that's not...  You're not making sense, though.  We get that.  What are you talking about?  Who?  It's obvious there's a lot of who's out there digging this shit.  That's obvious.  Well, I understand what you're saying, but I'm saying, Johnny K plus eight, yeah, bitch  pumped eight kids out of cunt.  Who gives a fuck? 
[01:19:00]  At the end of the day, who gives a fuck?  There's a war going on.  There's fucking people my age.  I'm 22 years old.  There's people my age out there fucking dying.  I agree with you, but a lot of people have chose not to go and find that information.  And they would rather sit and watch the John and Kate horse shit.  Do you understand?  We're all free-thinking human beings.  And if you really want to find out about that, especially in this day and age, it's  very easy to see.  Okay, but when I turn on channel fucking 10 news, I don't want to see Johnny K plus eight. 
[01:19:30]  I want to see fucking what's going on in the Middle East with the soldiers where my fucking  tax money is going.  Then don't...  I want to see where my money is going.  I don't give a fuck if some bitch is out there pumping out eight kids and being a fucking  cunt to her husband.  Then don't watch.  Dude, hold on.  Dude, all you can do is not watch it.  So don't watch it.  The good thing is there's enough places, whether it's Drudge or other...  You don't want to go to Huffington Post.  You want to go to CNN.com or any of the websites. 
[01:20:00]  There's plenty of places online to get the news that you want to get.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, I love you, dude.  I understand what you're saying, but 99.9% of people in America don't give a fuck about  the internet.  What they do when they get home from work is they turn on the fucking 10 o'clock news,  and what do they see?  John and Kate plus eight.  You're wrong that people don't care about the internet, though, guy.  The majority of Americans do have the internet, or I would say a good portion of Americans. 
[01:20:30]  And you kidding me?  Look at a YouTube viral video has 80 million views or 70 million views.  Yeah, people...  The internet is pretty damn huge now.  Ten years ago, dude, ten years ago your argument's correct, but now it's the internet, man.  You can become a tremendous star on the internet, or a tremendous force on the internet.  Yeah, I mean, if they were able...  I understand chocolate, right?  Who gives a fuck with some fucking douchebag on the internet?  Drew, I agree with you, but to think that they're controlling us by throwing all these 
[01:21:00]  distractions on TV, that's just not true anymore.  They can't hold back information from us.  Like Jimmy said, maybe ten years ago you would have a point, but not now.  And I don't know how things...  A lot of us spend more time on the internet than watching TV.  I certainly do.  I don't know how things run in Alabama, but let me tell you something.  I can watch...  Holy shit!  Hold it, hold it!  I'm just talking!  Well, he did cocaine last night.  I know.  You gotta give him a little...  I'm saying that people... 
[01:21:30]  He's just fucking...  You're good.  No, shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I said I don't know how things work in Alabama.  But I can log on to a stupid YouTube video and know what's going on with the wars in Afghanistan  and Iraq.  It's not like because you do one, you can't do the other.  I could know what stupid celebrities are doing all over and still be educated as far as what  our politicians are doing to rob us blind.  You know, it depends on what priority you have. 
[01:22:00]  Is the most important thing John and Kate?  Or is it, you know, what really affects you?  And that shit is just entertainment.  Well, I understand what you're saying, Mr. Ant.  But the mass majority of people get their information from the television, not the intranet, not the intraweb.  Oh my God, Drew.  We're going to go around in circles.  That's just not true anymore.  It's not true anymore.  You're out of touch when it comes to that.  A lot of people turn on their fucking computer and there's the news right there.  Some headlines.  Quick headlines before you go surfing. 
[01:22:30]  Updates on your phone?  I dial in to AOL and after I hear the...  That's why he's still at that point in Alabama.  We got Dave in Canada.  Hold on, Drew.  Hold on.  Yeah, Drew.  Dave, go ahead.  You're on with Drew from Alabama.  Drew?  Okay, thanks.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks.  What's Drew thinking?  Drew, come on, buddy.  Fucking, I live in goddamn Canada.  You're always making shit-ass fun of us here.  What are you fucking, where are you living? 
[01:23:00]  I don't know about the goddamn war and shit.  I don't give you this fucking crap that everybody's getting their goddamn information off the fucking TV set, man.  I'm living in Alabama, man.  Wherever the fuck your accent is from, faggot.  I love when they hate each other.  I know.  Let these two go.  Let these two go for a while.  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  One at a time.  Play it.  One at a time.  Yep.  Play it.  Oh, God.  Are you black now all of a sudden? 
[01:23:30]  What are you changing your fucking attitude?  I don't know.  I'm black all of a sudden.  No, I'm a white dude from Alabama.  You sound like a fucking nigga right now.  Ooh.  What are you doing?  Finish your point.  Go ahead.  One at a time.  Go ahead.  You done?  This stinks.  No, I'm not.  Yeah, I think you lost there, Dave in Canada.  Poor Canadian.  Drew's right about one thing, though.  And I don't know, they have showed less of the war and less bodies since Obama has been  in all of us.  Just last year, you've not been inundated with pictures of bodies coming home because it's 
[01:24:00]  no longer Bush.  And their thing is, well, it's not Obama's war, so they don't want to hurt him by showing  that stuff.  Obama did go and have a photo op by where they were bringing the caskets back from some  of the dead from Afghanistan.  What was funny about that?  I'm just saying, as a president, I think we're seeing a different side of the war, whereas 
[01:24:30]  Bush wanted people to see progress in what was going on, so we saw a lot of predator shots,  we saw a lot of buildings blowing up, Taliban being killed, this administration is showing  the cost of the war, the bodies and things like that, or at least the caskets and the  death count, more so than the Bush administration.  No.  Jimmy, you are getting them all around.  Cole fucking Kane!  He just laughs at that. 
[01:25:00]  Aaron writes on Instant Feedback, this guy's an idiot, TV never goes on, first thing when  I get home is computer, the computer gets turned on.  How old is Aaron?  Ask Aaron how old he is, because I'm talking about the 45, 55-year-old people that are too  fucking old to get on the computer when they get home.  Wait, wait, wait, how old are you?  He's 22.  You're 22?  I'm 22 years old.  How big are you?  I come home, and I don't even turn on the TV.  Cole fucking Kane! 
[01:25:30]  And let's see, Alabama Crescent Tide is playing football.  Cole fucking Kane!  Yeah, the Crescent Tide.  All right, Danny.  I love that.  You're saying that you don't...  I'll eat a chick during the Crescent Tide.  I don't even give a shit.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, wait a minute.  You've told us all.  Cole fucking Kane!  Crescent doesn't make sense, does it?  It certainly doesn't.  It just sounds stupid.  I just sounded stupid.  And Alabama's on the phone, and I sounded stupid.  Yeah, Crescent Tide.  Why?  I'll eat a pussy when she's on the blue water.  What?  It's on a certain type of cookie. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, my God, this guy...  Cole fucking Kane!  You guys fucking rule, man.  I'm just...  I'm just fucked up.  Yes, we do.  There he goes.  He's a good boy.  He'll probably think, damn, they finally turned my phone off.  Do we even have to argue the point?  Most people are getting their information from the internet right now.  It's amazing, right?  Or their phones, which is obviously part...  The internet is fucking...  It's amazing.  We grew up without it.  People who didn't grow up without it don't understand.  Like, I can't believe I ever lived without it.  Yeah.  I can't believe I lived without a cell phone. 
[01:26:30]  That is bizarre.  How did we get together?  How did we get together?  When you were in your car, you were completely cut off from the world.  From everybody.  Yes, you were.  It was the radio.  If there was a major disaster, the radio would pick it up and you'd know through that.  But as far as a personal thing goes or a friend needs help or that, which, you know, it's usually just bullshit calls.  But you were completely cut off until you got home.  Unless you're listening to this show and then the disaster was probably the show you were listening to. 
[01:27:00]  The show itself.  Yes, of course.  I want to call...  I want to call shenanigans on the USS New York.  Really?  They're saying it was built with 7.5 tons of steel from the World Trade Center.  Yeah.  Now, that sounds like an awesome thing, obviously.  Wow, a lot of steel, right?  I would be...  Well, how much does a fucking...  How much does the ship weigh?  I'm thinking there's a couple rivets they made from some of the remains from the World Trade Center.  It's probably 1,000 tons or more.  Danny, get us stats. 
[01:27:30]  How many tons?  They're saying 7.5 tons of this new warship was made from material from ground zero.  U.S. and Friday melt it down.  New York statistics.  Yeah.  But I think the average person would think that would be the majority of the ship.  No.  7.5 is not.  7.5 is nothing.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no.  I understand that.  But when they visually see the ship, they're thinking, wow, that was made from the remains  of ground zero.  Out of the ashes of 9-11 comes a ship forged of steel from the World Trade Center. 
[01:28:00]  Our nation's enemies brought the fight to New York.  The USS New York would now bring something to the future of blah, blah, blah.  How much does it weigh?  Yeah, how much does it weigh?  About.  It's got elephants five a ton.  That's going to be 1,000 tons.  Let's just say, 7.5 tons of steel from the World Trade Center went into the 600 trillion  tons of...  How many tons?  Does anyone know the answer to this?  We need the vital statistics.  Let me guess.  7.5 tons. 
[01:28:30]  Someone's saying five pounds.  Let's say maybe 1,000 tons is wrong.  1,000 tons is probably wrong.  Because an elephant, again, five tons, that's more than 200 tons.  I'm getting like 24,000 tons.  25,000 tons.  Okay, that's probably right.  Yeah, I was way off.  So 25,000 tons and 7.5.  I mean, that's a very small percentage.  I mean, it's still a cool thing, obviously.  I guess it's enough.  No, it's a cool thing, but...  They probably melted out in some steel they could use and dumped it in there.  Right.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Don in Jersey.  Don.  Welcome aboard, Donnie. 
[01:29:00]  Is that Don on the phone?  Hey, I love the show, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Don.  Welcome aboard.  Just want to say, concerning the wartime coverage, I don't know if you guys got a chance to check  this out on HBO.  It was a Taking Chance with Kevin Bacon.  It was fucking incredible.  Kevin Bacon.  Why was it incredible?  No, I did not.  So I'm asking why was it incredible.  It's the story, whenever a Marine is brought back here deceased, it's the story of how another  Marine has to accompany the casket all the way from when it lands on the U.S. soil to its 
[01:29:30]  final resting place.  And I guarantee you guys will shed tears when you watch it, all kidding aside.  It's called Taking Chance.  Sounds great.  All right.  Yeah, I'll take a look at that.  Thank you, sir.  It's awesome, bro.  We got a spray on there, the fucking, all ready to do their 21-gun salute.  Sure.  They do it yet?  Uh, no.  They're going to pass by Ground Zero with this and do a 21-gun salute.  And then they're parking in near the Intrepid at 10 a.m.  Yeah.  Right next door.  That way you can go and see it.  How about this?  For how long, though? 
[01:30:00]  Because they've got to use this thing, don't they?  I know.  What the fuck?  We've got plenty of ships everywhere.  How about enough, and take this as it's meant, enough pomp and circumstance with Ground Zero,  and how about they stop red-taping and fucking the city and build something?  How about enough salutes and enough tributes?  You want to tribute the victims, you have to fucking rebuild on the site instead of leaving  a hole there.  They just have to do all the tributes and it's still a goddamn hole because they're fucking  the red tape.  A lot of red tape there, Jimmy.  A lot of red tape. 
[01:30:30]  Just the idea that a ship was built with the metal from the World Trade Center, it is  now passing by Ground Zero, and there's still nothing there.  They built a ship with the fucking steel.  Nothing of significance, anyway.  That Freedom Tower is never going up.  I wonder if there is some kind of an underlying reason, if they're really waiting until they  can at least say the war is over or they've gotten Bin Laden.  Hell fucking no.  Because this way they're afraid.  It's greedy motherfuckers that are involved with that whole project. 
[01:31:00]  Hold on, play it out this way.  They're waiting until they can say that the war on terror has been really disabled.  This way, if they build bigger buildings there, they'll be able to rent the space.  People will rent them.  They might be afraid now if they rent them, they'll just be vacant on the top 30 or 40  floors.  I think it's greed.  I think it comes down to a simple word.  Well, that kind of would be greed.  I mean, if they're waiting because they wanted to rent the top floors, that could be classified  as greed.  I think it's just a bunch of horse shit.  It should have been built a long fucking time ago.  Horse shit. 
[01:31:30]  The city's all about greed.  I mean, look at this Bloomberg who thinks he's helping out in New York City.  And he can't get the tough jobs done.  You hear about the cabs?  Another surcharge for the cabs?  To cabs.  And we got a lot of them that listen to this show.  And I take a lot of cabs.  They're out of their fucking minds.  There's another 50 cent surcharge going.  Surcharge.  Great.  It's called a tax.  And already a cab ride in New York City is pretty fucking expensive.  So less people are walking when they realize, you know what?  I could probably hoof this one. 
[01:32:00]  I'm not going to take a cab.  The cabbies are hurting big time.  Yep.  And now they threw another 50 cent surcharge on those guys.  This motherfucker, Bloomberg, with his taxes, Corzine over there in Jersey.  If you're in Jersey, you know, I don't know how.  Corzine's the worst.  You are.  There's even a fucking decision to be made where you would put this taxing son of a bitch  back in office again.  You'd be insane.  If you do, you deserve to be drained of every fucking penny you have. 
[01:32:30]  Bloomberg, same thing.  What's his answer to everything?  Tax the fuck out of people.  I am now paying a tax that involves the MTA, the fucking, the transit of Manhattan.  What's that about?  I don't even live in New York City, you fucking hump.  What's that about?  Well, the MTA apparently is going broke because no one takes public transportation in Manhattan.  Yeah, they do, dude.  You crazy?  Oh, literal gym.  And instead of straightening the shit out and getting it to run smoothly, cut the waste. 
[01:33:00]  Are you suggesting there's some mismanagement going on?  Holy fuck is there mismanagement?  Are you suggesting that?  That's crazy, man.  You can't say that.  That all came out during that last strike debacle that they had with their fucking leader,  the union leader, who's a big piece of shit.  And the mismanagement, the money that is wasted in the transit authority is crazy.  I don't understand how they don't turn a profit.  That is mind-boggling to me.  Well, you know what?  Who cares?  With all the trains, the buses, the subways, the fucking tunnel traffic. 
[01:33:30]  Dude, why do they have to turn a profit when all they got to do is turn to me and you and everyone else  and just tax the living cunt out of us because that's exactly what they're doing.  Instead of raising the rates for the people that use it, which would anger them up the ass,  they give me an MTA transit tax that I have to pay, and I'm out on Long Island.  I pay E-ZPass in and out of the city every fucking day.  My gasoline in my truck, the more tax goes to that than the cost of the fucking gas. 
[01:34:00]  It's crazy.  There's some kind of surcharge on the gasoline, right?  Of course, there's basic taxes.  But I mean some kind of commuter surcharge, I'm sure.  By tires, you're going to be taxed.  Everything is a tax.  So you're doing your part by paying when you come in and out of New York City.  So why do you have to pay for the MTA if you're not using it?  I'm not using it.  That doesn't make fucking sense at all.  It doesn't help me like the – some people say, well, you don't have a kid, but you just pay the school tax. 
[01:34:30]  I pay the school tax in my neighborhood to keep the schools nice so the bad element doesn't move in and fuck my neighborhood up.  What is paying the MTA tax going to do for me?  How is that helping me as a taxpayer?  It's not.  It's letting people off the hook because it's easier for these politician motherfuckers to tax the shit out of us.  Here's what I'm doing for the first time in history.  First time in history.  I am going to a voting booth tomorrow.  Tomorrow's voting day, yeah.  And I am pulling the lever for fucking right-wing conservative motherfucker. 
[01:35:00]  I don't care what his name is.  I don't care if he's been involved in an abortion clinic bombing.  I am voting for him.  That's how hard fucking right I'm going.  But those guys suck too.  And I know.  They all suck.  They just don't suck for taxing like these.  Don't get me wrong.  They all suck.  Don't get me wrong.  I know.  But you know something?  Our taxes suck no matter who's in there.  I'll fucking give her her own abortion.  I don't need the law to tell me that I can't do that.  The taxes suck no matter who the fuck is in there. 
[01:35:30]  No.  No.  Yes.  We're paying too much taxes no matter what.  It's worse when the Democrats are in.  But it still always has been.  So we go back to Republicans.  You're going to be happy?  Yeah.  I'd be happier.  There's still way too many fucking taxes coming out of our fucking pocket.  The Republicans are more.  No matter who's in there.  Yeah, of course.  No matter who the fuck is in there.  But the Republicans are more for cutting the fucking waste instead of overtaxing the shit out.  Look at what Corazine's done.  He went into that situation and he's taxed the living fuck out of everyone. 
[01:36:00]  They can't even live anymore.  People are leaving.  And New York City is another thing.  Bloomberg taxes the shit out of everyone.  Now people have to leave.  Look at sweater meat.  What?  What?  There's a nice sweater meat coming by.  It'll relax you.  Oh, there she is.  Okay.  Okay.  They can't even leave.  As a matter of fact, more people have left New York that were paying high taxes than they're gaining from raising the taxes.  They love putting Band-Aids on these fucking problems.  Yeah.  And ignoring the fact that they got a major issue with this MTA. 
[01:36:30]  A major fucking issue.  If you got holes in a bucket and you're filling it up with water and the water keeps leaking out,  instead of fixing the holes, they just turn the water up more.  It's like, oh, we'll just turn the fucking water up higher.  Did you hear what came out?  Where are the water?  Did you hear what came out with the Amtrak thing?  Maybe Danny can find it because I need the exact price.  But every time someone buys a ticket for Amtrak, Amtrak is losing a certain amount of money.  That's how bad Amtrak has got.  They lose money.  How the fuck is that possible?  On every ticket sold.  How the fuck is that possible? 
[01:37:00]  Except in the Northeast Corridor.  Except the Northeast Corridor, right.  There's one that goes from somewhere to L.A., I believe.  And every time someone buys a ticket for that particular run especially, they're losing a – oh, God.  How much money was it?  It was unbelievable to me.  It was over $400 per ticket.  Was it $400?  Where is it?  Study says Amtrak loses $32 per passenger.  Oh, per passenger.  So that's throughout the entire system.  Yeah.  And, okay, here it is.  Los Angeles and New Orleans, New Orleans, they lose $462 per person. 
[01:37:30]  Per person.  How the fuck do they get to stay in business?  If your business sucks that bad, guess what?  You're going under.  You're gone.  And that's the point.  But we can't allow Amtrak to go under.  We can't allow the MTA to go under.  Well, the MTA is –  Well, eventually something's got to happen.  That should be taken over by somebody that will go in there and just wipe the fucking thing clean and re-staff. 
[01:38:00]  Because now it's at the point where there's so much fucking criminal activity.  Crooks just pocketing money, favors, bullshit, unions holding the city hostage.  I've had it.  Fuck them.  And now I've got to fucking write another check with my federal and my state and my fucking city to school, property, and now this MTA tax.  I've got to fucking cut another check to bail these cocksuckers out. 
[01:38:30]  And then the surcharge on the cabbies on top of it.  It's amazing.  Yeah, now going to cab –  A cab ride is expensive to begin with.  Fuck them.  I am literally at the point where I'm being taxed so much I really am thinking – I have to think about what I do.  And I used to be very carefree and reckless, let's say.  I have to think about things like employing people.  And that helps the economy.  That helps when I gainfully employ people. 
[01:39:00]  My business employs people.  And I have to look and go, I'm not going to be able to employ this person anymore because of the taxes.  So what did that just do?  It just put another person on the unemployment line or trying to look for a job.  They don't know how to fix the problems.  They don't know how to put Band-Aids on the problems.  Bad ones, too.  The stupid Bloomberg.  They all suck.  That's where I'm at with this shit.  Bloomberg and Corazine – but Bloomberg's getting elected. 
[01:39:30]  It doesn't matter.  But we have term limits.  Corazine –  Wait, we have term limits?  No, he decided –  How the fuck would turn that around?  He just decided –  Are we supposed to vote on that at least?  No, he said –  What's that about?  For real?  I don't know.  He said we won't vote on the term limits.  But if I go up for election and people didn't want term limits, they just won't vote for me.  Then why didn't he say that with Giuliani?  Didn't he fucking fight Giuliani?  He was a big one.  After 9-11, when Giuliani wanted to stay on a little longer to make sure –  Logistically, the city can operate. 
[01:40:00]  And he was the guy in there.  Bloomberg said, no, this is the time we need somebody to come in and show that things are still running and working.  The system still works.  And this motherfucker, out of nowhere, just bought his way a third term.  And now he's literally buying into getting a third term.  I still think I prefer him over a Democrat, a liberal Democrat for taxing, even though he is a Democrat.  But he is a liberal Democrat.  I know, but he's at least slightly more conservative, I think, than the other guy will be, than Thompson will be.  Let me think in which way. 
[01:40:30]  Fiscally?  Yeah, I just think taxing, I think he's going to be a little bit better than the other dude.  He's horrid with taxing.  He's so bad.  But he's going to be better than a Democrat.  This guy's going to answer the transit problems.  We've got Jay in Wisconsin.  He's a locomotive engineer.  What's up, Jay?  How much, guys?  I don't know from taxes, though, where you guys are, but we just started up a new corridor transit authority for passengers.  They haven't done it since the 70s out here.  And I'll tell you what, one way, and we go probably about 60 miles, okay? 
[01:41:00]  And for a 60-mile trip, one way is $7, okay?  So it's $14 round trip.  These railroads operate and how they sell their seats based on the absolute lowest amount that they can charge.  For anything, okay?  So what they then do is they go back, and being a union member, you know, I'm not going to say who I work for because I don't want to get the carrier on the ass,  but these fucking unions, they sell away our rights because one trip rate for a locomotive engineer was $350 a day. 
[01:41:30]  It's now $280 a day.  They just cut our wages here last week because they said they can't run it.  Well, so the question becomes, why are we taxing, you know, people like you guys that don't live in the city or live outside where you're not going to use the transit?  Because it's easy, because we're villains, because, you know, it's very easy to tax instead of fixing the problem.  Fixing a problem is such a hassle and makes you very unpopular with the majority of people. 
[01:42:00]  They do studies.  They take polls.  They say, who's the least amount of people we could piss off and get the most money in so that I'll still get elected my next term?  One thing, though, to consider, and this is one reason mass transit is needed, is because they're thinking is if you make it too unaffordable, people will just start driving their cars.  Right, exactly.  And they're thinking that the congestion, they're thinking that will make matters worse.  There's a third solution.  Fix the fucking problem. 
[01:42:30]  Don't put the whole cost on the rider of the MTA or the people that aren't riding it but, you know, are taxed anyway.  Well, and, you know, our crews are the guys that run Amtrak between, we're in the northern corridor that goes out towards Seattle, and that Amtrak line makes zero dollars because they can put their hand out to the government, and the government says, huh, you're fucking going under?  Well, the government runs Amtrak.  They do, yes.  That is a fact.  Yeah, they run Amtrak, so it's not like, you know, they're the ones losing the money, which, by the way, means the taxpayers. 
[01:43:00]  We own Amtrak.  I hate saying the government.  Whenever I say the government, please correct me and say we, because we're the ones shelling out the money.  So when the government gives somebody $18 billion or the government does this and pays for AIDS for Africa or this, that, it's not this nameless, faceless thing.  It's everybody when you pump your fucking money in to them.  Well, as far as mass transit goes, I hate to cut you off, but as far as mass transit goes, every mass transit system that we have that we use as an engineer, and, you know, that's how I make my livelihood, they're set to fail. 
[01:43:30]  I mean, they don't make money, and they won't make money for the next five years, and it's made off the taxpayers' back.  Because the particular part of rail that we use for that, in the 80s, they tore it all out and basically put substandard rail in there.  In this, the state that I'm in, they made the taxpayers $280 million to replace what they tore out because they didn't want to maintain. 
[01:44:00]  It's getting a little too technical.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  You made your point there.  I appreciate it.  Bye, Jay.  Just fix the fucking waste.  That's all.  Let me go to Scott in Virginia.  Scott.  Hey, here's a good one for you.  My lady that does my quarterly taxes was telling me that the health care plan that's coming out for companies that have below or have 25 employees or more, if they don't provide health care for their employees, they're going to be penalized. 
[01:44:30]  Yep.  So what's that mean?  That means that if I've got 26 employees and I can do the job with 24, two people are going out the door.  You know you're firing two people instead of getting this mandatory health care.  Absolutely.  It's outrageous what it costs for an employer.  People don't think about what an employer pays to have insurance for their employees.  And why do they think when you listen to the news and they say, signs are pointing that the recession may be over. 
[01:45:00]  Companies are showing less losses and some are even turning a profit.  But the one thing we can't understand is, how come unemployment is still up and rising?  Well, the companies are showing profit because they're throwing people out the fucking door.  They don't have to pay people.  So the unemployment goes up and the companies can turn a profit.  Well, that isn't fixing the fucking problem.  Well, here's the other part of that. 
[01:45:30]  They're talking about how the unemployment numbers are going down state by state.  Well, the reason they're going down is because people are running out of their unemployment and not drawing on the system anymore.  Yeah, exactly.  That's another thing, too.  They're running out of their benefits.  So it's less unemployment.  Hey, you guys have a great day.  Thank you, sir.  So goddamn ridiculous.  Fix the fucking waste.  All the waste.  And you see with these fucking, like the MTA, where are the suits getting thrown out the door?  Where are those people? 
[01:46:00]  How about you make some fucking sacrifices over there?  Because the second they try to fire someone, the union steps in and gives you 20 reasons why you can't fire this fucking person that is wasting money.  So they go, well, okay, let's raise taxes.  There you go.  Let's put a 50-cent surcharge on taxi rides.  Let's go to Keith in Westchester.  Keith.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I actually work in a village in Westchester County, and we don't even have a rail system that goes through our village, but they are taxing our residents to use. 
[01:46:30]  See, they can't even use that excuse like, well, you got a train station right here in your town, so you got to kind of help us pay for it.  They can't even use that excuse.  And they're only making selective towns that are within the area of their rail service to pay this tax.  Gee, I wonder which towns.  To simplify it, the politicians like Anthony brought up, we bring this up all the time, they don't want to fix the real problems because they would piss off too many fucking people, and then they wouldn't get re-elected. 
[01:47:00]  You got to make some real tough decisions out there instead of continue to put Band-Aids on the problems.  In some of the worst economic times we've had recently, the worst thing they could do is tax the shit out of the people that are employing people.  Because like that other guy said, you just fire them.  Right.  You fire the people to compensate for your tax loss.  Right.  And then what do those people do?  Bill in Philly.  Bill.  Oh, Bill. 
[01:47:30]  Shouldn't the government tell Amtrak to figure out your fucking problem if you want more money from us, or is that too simple?  Is that too simple?  Yeah, too simple.  Is that simplifying it too much?  Too simple to go, what does this guy do?  Right.  If you want more money, you guys got to fucking figure out your issues here.  Yeah.  And then come back to us with some kind of real solution instead of raising your rates and taxing the fucking people that are using your service?  It doesn't make sense.  Okay, you ready?  Yes, let's go, Bill.  Sorry.  Okay.  So I took a trip down about five years ago on Amtrak down to Richmond. 
[01:48:00]  They didn't take credit card information, but they told me that the train was sold out, but I had the last seat on the train.  When I rode down there, it was practically empty.  I wanted to take a later train back from Richmond to Philly, and so I said, can I change my reservation?  They said they could not cancel.  They couldn't give me a later reservation because all their trains sold, they were sold out back to Philly.  I said, well, obviously none of the passengers made it down from Philly to Richmond. 
[01:48:30]  Can't you just give me one of the seats?  And they said, we don't know who didn't make it down.  And I said, nobody made it down except for me.  Can't you just give me a later one?  That's why they run so inefficiently.  They're not like the airlines where you get penalized.  You don't give a credit card information.  You can just call up and make a reservation, and they don't take any information down.  The trains show reserved and full, but they aren't. 
[01:49:00]  All right, sir.  Unbelievable.  I'm sorry.  So distracted by Jody Sweden.  Who's Jody Sweden?  She was in full house, remember?  How old is she now?  I don't know, but she was a meth head.  We're supposed to get her.  We said yes to her, didn't we?  She actually looks good for a former meth head.  Is she coming in?  Yeah.  Agassi said he was doing the crystal meth.  You read that one yet?  Yeah, huh?  Not as hot as her doing it, though.  No, I understand that.  Yeah, she looks real good.  How old is she now?  Also, speaking of Agassi, you know that fucking lion's mane weird hair fucking thing he had? 
[01:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was a wig.  That's coming out today.  Yeah.  Could you get a picture of that?  He had the big, giant hair, and then all of a sudden he shaved his head, but he grew  back completely bald.  I think they're calling, yeah, the lion's mane hairstyle he had in the 90s was a wig.  That's coming out, too.  How could he play with a wig?  This fucking book he wrote is going to be a good read.  How did he play tennis with a wig on?  I don't fucking know.  So what?  He was already bald and just doing the fucking lion's mane wig? 
[01:50:00]  We all bought it, right?  Fuck.  He had a great head of hair.  Let's go to Ryan in Redding.  Ryan?  Yo.  Hey, Ryan.  I work for one of the freight railroads where we actually have to turn a profit or else  we go out of business, but we get trade magazines shipped into our office quite a while.  Swank.  And one of them's Progressive Railroader, and they do articles on all the different types  of railroads.  Amtrak, about two or three years ago, hired a gentleman who totally turned the company 
[01:50:30]  around.  He canned all these people that were skimming off the bottom and stuff like that.  And had that company on track to start turning a profit within less than two years, they  fired him in eight months.  Jesus.  There's too much fucking red tape to fire people these days.  You can't have a business or run a government and just say, all right, I've looked into the  books.  This guy does nothing. 
[01:51:00]  Or this guy has a redundant job.  Um, uh, let's, we got to get rid of him or, or transfer him into an area that is a growing  part of the company.  Something.  What they do is they have 15 administrators that all keep their jobs as, uh, we're getting  taxed to death.  Yeah.  There you go.  It's ridiculous.  It's on the news.  The cabbies are out of their minds today.  That's, that's a biggie.  Cause they were just at their wits ends.  Uh, these guys, uh, these guys, and now they got another surcharge to deal with today. 
[01:51:30]  Unbelievable.  That's why I could give a shit of abortion, fucking gay marriage, get all that shit.  I'm throwing it out the fucking window and, and voting down the conservative line tomorrow  conservative, like a fucking like, like, uh, I want a fascist line.  I want a Nazi line.  I could just pull up the lever next to the swastika.  That's how far fucking over I want to go.  For guys like you, they should have just one lever.  One big fucking lever. 
[01:52:00]  That says, fuck everyone but me lever.  Hey, the Agassi thing.  How good was he that he knew that fucking wig wasn't going to fall off while he was playing?  That's what I'm saying.  How do you play tennis?  The more I think about it, he's got this line.  He always had the headband on, right?  The lion main wig.  He was confident if that thing wasn't going to fall off as he's playing tennis.  How embarrassing.  That's pretty amazing.  Uh, yeah, he wasn't a headband.  Drew in Alabama.  Drew.  Oh, my God.  Am I bothering y'all?  A little bit.  Go fucking Kane! 
[01:52:30]  No, no, no, no.  Hey, Drew, I want to ask you a question.  You're 22 years old, right?  And you're rah-rah American, and that's, uh, that's cool to hear.  Why aren't you fucking over there fighting if you, if you give a shit about the wars?  Oh, we're going back to wars now.  I was fixing to fucking bump fist with Ant-Man.  Man, I was going to tell them, man, fucking detectation shit is fucking garbage.  But you didn't answer my question, because I'm still thinking about what you said earlier  in the show.  If you're such a rah-rah, fuck John and Kate, I want to know what's going on with our soldiers 
[01:53:00]  and stuff.  Why didn't you join the effort?  I can fuck the government, man.  See, my answer would be, I'm too scared to fucking die.  Yeah, I don't want to die.  Yeah, but you're all about it, though.  Shorten everyone over there.  Oh, I know.  I'm a fucking wimp.  I'll tell you right now.  All right, what do you got on taxes, Drew? 
[01:53:30]  Jesus.  Oh, what, am I bugging you?  Yeah, a little bit.  Well, I think I'm talking for a lot of people, actually, Drew.  The taxes and stuff, that goes back to the John K.  Those have to be implants.  Damn it, does she look good.  Yeah, I'm really good.  She was a skinny kid during the show, remember?  Yeah, I agree.  Well, you know, the crystal meth would do that.  And now, look at those kids.  Unless she was doing that after the show.  Dude, that's not even, that's not the flat chested push-up bra thing she's doing either.  Oh, that's some nice boobies, man.  She looks good, man.  That's some nice implants. 
[01:54:00]  And she was a meth head?  How do you come out of a meth head with, like, teeth and stuff?  Yeah, a fucking meth.  And she had a kid.  She should be the poster child for fucking crystal meth, don't you think?  For crystal meth.  And she had a kid.  Hey, kids, crystal meth is good for you.  Look at these fucking pictures.  It didn't affect her at all.  God damn.  God damn.  That's a nice fucking...  That's a fucking set of fake tits right there.  You're hot.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  My point, my point I was trying to make, sir. 
[01:54:30]  Let me make your point for you, sir.  Ah, great point, Opie.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike in Michigan.  Mike.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, my dad worked for Amtrak for 36 years.  Mike did.  And they just forced him to retire.  You stop pointing that conductor's head at my dad.  You stop pointing that conductor's punch at my daddy.  See, I know some of the weird shit that goes on and, you know, some of the shit that...  Yeah? 
[01:55:00]  Why don't you tell us what really happened?  Well, the food that they serve...  That man's wronged that last car for three years for us, and all of a sudden, he's gonna  just do something I can't improve?  It sounds more like Ted than Chris Penn.  I'm Ted Penn.  My brother's name is Chris, and my sloppy brother's pig.  That's nice guy Teddy.  Nice guy Teddy.  All right, Mike. 
[01:55:30]  What do you got?  The food in the cafe car that they serve usually sits in those fridges for, like, three or four  months, because they can never sell it.  And when people do eat it, they get sick as fuck.  What are you talking about?  What are we talking...  What happened?  Where are we, Mike?  He makes a good point, actually.  Where are we, Mike?  He makes a good point.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob.  Say it again, sir, but this time while you're running through a window.  Rob.  Yeah.  Rob.  Hello?  Rob.  Anthony, have you guys ever taken the Acela train? 
[01:56:00]  We've taken it many times, when we used to have to go down to XM's main facility.  Many times.  Yeah.  So let me ask you, boys, with all the money that our government...  Our stupid fucking Democratic bunch of assholes out there, what are they doing with all  of this fucking money that they are putting into the rail systems, and they are not putting  the sellers all over the country?  I don't know.  I don't know what they do.  Yeah, good, good question.  That's a very good question.  Because they're bringing in enough fucking money to make Acela trains all over the damn 
[01:56:30]  place, first of all, yes.  And second of all, they should be able to figure it out where it turns a fucking profit or comes  close to turning a profit.  Well, I'll tell you, the cost for the Acela train down in Washington was so expensive,  my wife and I decided to screw in the bathroom to make it worth our while.  Ah, there you go.  All right, well...  You get a nice shaky part of the track, and you don't even have to move.  It's an effortless fucking...  Yeah, definitely.  Don't feel silly.  It's where it gets a little shaky.  That's a glad scars.  Under the armpit? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You found the scars?  That's not bad, though.  That's good.  It's a good doctor, though.  It doesn't fuck the nipples up.  Very good doctor.  God damn, though.  Thank you, sir.  She's got to show those.  How old is she, Danny?  27.  27?  We were supposed to have her.  Are we going to get her?  Tomorrow.  Yeah, she's in tomorrow.  Oh, man, we are.  Tomorrow.  Jody Sweet.  Jody Sweet from Full House.  Oh, okay.  She was on the meth for a while.  Got her act together.  She was doing crystal meth.  That doesn't look like a meth head.  I see them on Cops all the time.  Wow. 
[01:57:30]  Well, are we done with the tax thing for today?  It's just enraging for everybody.  Yeah, it's a daily infuriation for me.  This guy wants in.  Blake in Wisconsin.  Blake.  Ah.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, you said you wanted a Nazi switch.  I wanted to ask you what the hell you think the National Socialist Party is going to do  to help this situation.  Take some of your money and a huge salary  and get behind some libertarian candidates  and get somebody in office that'll help you.  Ah, you know what?  It would be great if they actually fucking won. 
[01:58:00]  It's usually taking a vote away from a Republican or something,  even though the Republican Party stinks these days.  I don't know what the fuck to do.  That's why I'm throwing the handle for some conservative nut jobs.  I'm throwing a monkey wrench in the works.  Are you?  What the fuck?  Why not?  Why not?  All right, well, we'll take a break and get into some other shit.  I'll protect my fucking tax money and my guns.  That's all I give a shit about these days.  We have a very good piece of audio coming up right after the break.  Ooh.  Wow.  It's a Dewey story, which is terrific. 
[01:58:30]  It has a nice twist.  A very nice twist.  It's exhausting what they do to us.  Oh, I know.  I get so riled.  It's exhausting.  I hate it.  Fucking bill after bill comes in the mailbox and it's like,  what the fuck is this?  Tax effects?  Oh, here.  Here's another tax.  The bridge and tunnels are making a lot of fucking money.  Yeah, I throw hard cash.  It's a cash business.  Where is this money going?  Every day I'm tossing money into their till using their fucking tunnels and their roads 
[01:59:00]  and paying the New York state tax that's supposed to take care of fucking things like roads  and all the tolls I pay and bullshit.  And then what?  They slap me with another one to pay for their fucking choo-choo train?  Are the roads that much better?  The bridges that much better?  No, they stink.  Since we've been driving?  No, it's the same crap.  Go back 20 years ago.  It's pretty much the same fucking roadway.  Patch up a few holes and you're good to go.  Yeah, that's what they do.  So where the fuck is all the money going?  You sit there on a daily basis when they close a lane on the expressway, 
[01:59:30]  so you've got to wait fucking a half hour to get past fucking one lane closure.  Well, I don't know what they're doing because the next day they're gone and nothing had been done.  Where does the money go?  Yes, it is, James.  It is.  Can you explain where the money goes, Ant?  I wish I knew.  Is it for the management?  To line the pockets of the government's machine.  But where's, like...  Where does it go?  You know what it goes?  It goes to congressional fucking bullshit. 
[02:00:00]  It goes to this union organizer.  It goes to fucking executives and administrators of schools that don't even have as many students as they used to  because of foreclosures and people moving out, but they won't fire the administrators.  It just trickles down until it's gone.  That's crazy.  You throw it in at Big Till, and then it just goes away as everyone takes their fucking piece, as they all grab in.  It's happening in every city, but we know New York, and you start really thinking about how much cash they're collecting every day, 
[02:00:30]  and you're like, how are you telling me this city is going broke?  It doesn't make sense to me.  There's not one motherfucker out there listening that hasn't been affected by the fucking tax, the raising of taxes out there by this administration.  Sorry.  You've all been affected.  And if you don't think so, wait a couple of months until you get the bills.  I get them, like, every three months.  Wait till, you know, April rolls around.  You go to your accountant and then say, where's my refund? 
[02:01:00]  And he laughs in your fucking face.  Refund?  You owe money, motherfucker!  And you'll go, but wait, I got a refund last year.  Yup, that was last year.  Who else do you want a motherfucker?  I got one.  Huh?  David Spade.  Oh, oh, right, yeah, yeah.  Who else do you want a motherfucker today?  Why David Spade?  Oh, we brought that up.  Well, he made a commercial with fucking Farley, and now everyone's kind of outraged, and now he's trying to explain himself.  It's like...  Don't explain it!  You made fucking money off your...  An homage? 
[02:01:30]  Your...  It wasn't.  Did he say?  He was making a nice fucking, fucking payday.  Which is fine!  What, what are they, what are they, they compromise the integrity of Tommy Boy?  Or fucking Wayne's World?  You make a good point.  Oh, yeah, those were real work.  Sorry, Citizen Kane.  Didn't mean to step out when the fat guy tore the jacket.  Shut the fuck up, people.  Farley was a funny guy.  He's dead.  Make the money you can make.  He'd be happy his friend was making some cash.  Off his dead body, though.  It's not the integrity of the actual movies.  Like, it's the David Spade defense direct TV ad with Chris Farley. 
[02:02:00]  There's nothing wrong with doing those ads.  I think they're a little stupid.  But there's nothing wrong with them as far as he's making money off it.  Who cares?  I want to know if they digitally changed.  Is it Kim Basinger?  Dude, what do you mean you want to know?  I was about, you beat me to the punch.  Yeah, yeah.  They're using that fucking, the curious case of Benjamin.  Benjamin Button fucking.  Whatever the fucking they did there.  And they used it in X-Men, too.  You didn't look up Kim Basinger's age when you saw that commercial?  Going, wow. 
[02:02:30]  You see the commercial.  It's with, what's his name, fucking from Wayne's World there.  Dana Carvey.  Yeah.  And you're looking at Kim Basinger and you go, wow, she hasn't aged at all.  So then you go to IMDB, she's 58 years old.  That ain't no 58-year-old face.  That's not a 58-year-old woman.  I'm sorry.  No.  They fucking did some kind of new technology on her face for the commercial.  CGI magic.  There's no way that's her real face.  Even with a little makeup to cover it up.  There's no fucking way whatsoever.  No, you could tell makeup and stuff like that, but they might have done some digital fucking. 
[02:03:00]  Might have?  There's not a doubt in my soul that they did.  A little rubber banding under the neck, maybe, and some digital work.  You can only rubber band so much, man.  The skin color was like.  Perfect.  Yeah, nice.  It was smooth.  There wasn't a hint of a wrinkle.  There was no turkey neck.  There was nothing.  And it didn't look big makeup thing to cover up any discoloration of age or anything.  What do you mean you think?  They got some fucking voodoo technology they're using in Hollywood now, which means our Hollywood 
[02:03:30]  stars are going to be around forever now.  Well, it's very difficult.  It's a long, arduous procedure to take out somebody's face when they're moving around like  that.  But I guess they did it to her, huh?  They certainly did.  Jimmy had a great idea, though, of what might have happened, that they actually filmed  the DirecTV commercial while they filmed Wayne's World.  Yeah, that's possible.  Knowing that there was going to be something called DirecTV in a few years.  That's a possible thing.  I don't like his explanation. 
[02:04:00]  It wasn't an homage.  Stop pussying out, David.  You did the gig.  So what?  Make the money.  You took the money off your fat dead friend.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  I just don't like David Spade.  It made me feel a little creepy when I first saw it.  I don't like David Spade.  So.  I'm Team Farley on this one.  I don't think Farley would mind, though.  Team Farley's family on this one.  I don't think they'd mind either.  They'd probably make money off it.  They'd probably make a few bucks off it.  I'm sure the Farley camp made a few dollars.  People are like, I'd say, yo, he's wrong. 
[02:04:30]  Because a guy died?  He can't make money?  Well, I don't know where the outrage is coming from, actually.  I don't either.  We should find out.  People should just shut their fucking faces.  We should find out.  Who gives a turkey?  Excuse my French.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Let's see.  Here's the commercial.  This is Kim B.  So it's a little blurry.  And that affects the tube.  But look at her.  She looks fucking amazing.  I've got direct TV.  That's not a face of a 58-year-old woman.  She's not moving her face around a lot, which makes it easier to digitally enhance. 
[02:05:00]  Right.  Oh, you see her?  Like, right there, she probably should have turned to the side, but she stopped.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's a good call by Anthony right there.  She barely moved.  Yeah, she doesn't move her face a lot.  Move just enough so you know it's like, you know, it's her doing her thing.  Yeah.  Moving targets are very hard with TV.  Has anyone looked into this commercial?  Is there a blog on this?  We have.  We just did it.  Watch.  They're going to start bringing this up on the news, and we'll say, we talked about it.  You heard it here first on the Open Air.  I want to know what technology they're using on these commercials.  Same thing they did in X-Men when they made Picard Younger, and the same technology they 
[02:05:30]  used on that other thing.  The curious case of Benjamin and Brad Pitt.  And if you notice on that one, too, those shots are him really not moving very much.  It's hard to get a moving face and digitally take out wrinkles and discoloration and just  the basic age of skin.  Yeah.  All right.  Crow's feet.  Let me say how to Tony in Pennsylvania. 
[02:06:00]  Tony.  Hey, those commercials are digitally enhanced to all of them, especially the ones where  you think Spade looks that young anymore, either.  Oh, all of them digitally enhanced?  I never even thought of that.  You know something?  Yeah, I wasn't right.  I didn't even notice what Spade looked like in his.  The Kim Basinger one is very obvious.  They're all digitally enhanced.  In fact, you guys see the one with Sigourney Weaver?  She doesn't look that young anymore.  She's got one?  Yeah.  Oh, the alien where she's in the fucking, uh, I don't remember seeing this one. 
[02:06:30]  This one's Back to the Future.  Back to the Future one.  Great Scott!  I forgot to tell Marty when he gets back to the future.  He needs to get direct TV HD.  I already have all the best channels and soon they'll have three times more HD capacity.  They had a little rough in time with him, huh?  They had a problem with him.  I mean, you can still see they're using that technology, but he looks older.  They actually brought Spielberg in and went to Industrial Lights and Magic to try to fix him in that one. 
[02:07:00]  That was the first one that didn't work as well.  Oh, here's the alien one, yeah.  Sigourney Weaver, yeah.  Get away from her, are you?  This thing just goes away.  She looks kind of old there, eh?  Yeah, I know.  Nah, she looks old.  Not that bad, though.  I mean, it's not as bad as when you realize that film is real fucking old.  Right.  How they didn't do as good of a job with her?  Kim Basinger is the best one.  To be fair, though, I mean...  But you can tell that they're all being made to look younger. 
[02:07:30]  Sigourney Weaver, her face hasn't changed in probably 20 years.  Yeah, really?  She looks older, but...  I mean, it's not like she's hot or anything, but...  Yeah, and she's not supposed to be hot like Kim Basinger.  Do you ever think she was hot?  For real?  For real.  Come on, let's get into this.  No, no, you know something?  She was supposed to be...  Ghostbusters.  When I was a kid, maybe a Ghostbusters.  Get the fuck out of here.  She was never hot.  In the first Alien, there was something about her, but I think it was also the character  itself was really cool, and, you know, at that age...  But Hollywood was trying to make her like she was a sexpot or something. 
[02:08:00]  When she got in the escape craft, you saw her hiney, and it was all flat.  How about Noosh?  Little Newt.  No one calls me Rebecca.  You think that's hot for real, Ann?  She's got horrible tits.  Come on.  She had a good body, though.  I mean, she was attractive.  Yeah, because she's younger and all, but she was not a fucking hot boy.  No, she wasn't like a hottie or anything, but okay, look at her big bloomers, her big  70s bloomers from Alien. 
[02:08:30]  She had a nice set of boobies, but I don't know.  And she had a big hairy bush, I think.  I think I might have seen that.  Look what's in those pants.  It's like Jiffy Pop.  Jesus.  It's the old Jiffy Pop.  Dude, you know, that hair down there was probably exactly like the hair on her head.  Holy shit.  Big black and curly.  Covering the lips.  Yeah.  Just completely.  Awful.  What a mess.  Open it up.  The alien mouth comes out and snaps at you.  Yeah.  I touch it.  Do you think it smelled like mothballs?  Oh, yeah.  When you pull those panties down? 
[02:09:00]  A little ripe.  A little underarm.  A little musty.  Musky?  Delicious.  Musky?  What's the word?  Musty.  Musty or musky.  They are, right?  All right.  One for me today.  Nice.  I hate this one.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob.  Yeah, I saw that same commercial, and I swear, it's not new.  They take an old footage, and they dissect it digitally, and then they reconstruct it frame  by frame to get her mouth to say what they did.  Nah, now you're talking crazy.  Now you're talking crazy. 
[02:09:30]  Now you're talking crazy.  No.  I don't know.  Let's slow down.  No, that type of technology isn't as good as you are explaining.  Well, someone can't do that.  Someone has to, it has to be explained somewhere on the internet.  No, I like your thought, Rob, but I don't know.  Wipe some cocoa on your face and get the dirt off.  Yeah, hey, Newt, you got a dirty face.  Let's let me throw you in the tub.  Or give you a good washing.  Uncle Paul would walk up, she'd do that high-pitched scream. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Hey, keep it down, Newt.  The monsters will get you if you tell our secrets.  Be careful.  The aliens are going to give you a bite and a fanny.  A fanny.  Let's go to Tim in Australia.  Tim.  I just thought it would taste...  Yes, it's him.  Listen.  Sorry, go ahead.  I was talking about the Chris Farley ad.  I thought it would taste as if he's a dead man like that.  I know some people might not agree with me, but I didn't like it.  Did you see it and go, I know. 
[02:10:30]  Well, the other, the thing on the Farley, I think the Farley family had to agree to...  They did.  Yeah.  Farley's likeness being in a commercial like that.  They're raping his dead body.  I think they signed off on it, to be honest with you.  Dude, they're just using a guy in a commercial.  You act like it was fucking Lincoln's Gettysburg address.  Come on, who cares?  Gettysburg?  That's the one about the gas station?  Yes, it was different than Gettysburg.  Yes.  It was the Jew that bought a gas station.  Let's go to Rape Kid. 
[02:11:00]  I have no problem with this commercial.  Rape Kid?  No.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, the previous caller was pretty accurate, actually.  Basically, what they do is they take the scene as it appears in the movie, and they digitally  have the actor stand in the same spot, and they just take the mouth, and they basically merge  it onto the mouth of the actor from the scene in the movie. 
[02:11:30]  Kind of like Conan.  It's not as difficult as you might think because of the fact that...  It's always...  Dude, it's always noticeable, though.  That is not even an inkling that that mouth is different than the face itself.  You ever see that baby for the...  God, I think it's an online trading service or something, and he's bitching out the fucking  guy that he just played golf with, and they put the baby mouth talking on the baby.  It's obvious that that's not his mouth.  There's something CGI looking about it. 
[02:12:00]  You can't tell me that that is not her fucking mouth moving.  And the Kid Basinger thing...  I mean, you can study...  With the technology they have, Anthony, they have the ability with motion capture, and also  if you even go back to the movie Babe from way back when, they started doing this more  convincingly with better money used than...  Yeah, well, look at Forrest Gump.  Forrest Gump, it was obvious.  Well, that's a while ago.  Well, this motherfucker's bringing up Babe.  Yeah, that's true, too. 
[02:12:30]  And if you suspend disbelief and watch the original movie, you'll see it's not as perfect as it  actually is.  Rape Kid, you look at that Kim Basinger, it's tough to see any fucking...  Now, Rape Kid, because I don't agree with you, I'm bouncing you.  Atta boy, Ian.  Why'd you do that?  Rape Kid just got bounced.  Every time he calls with something I don't agree with, bounce-a-rooney. 
[02:13:00]  That's what you gotta do, kiddo.  There's no flaws in the Kim Basinger thing.  You can't...  Yeah.  It looks too good, so I'm trying to figure out what the fuck is it.  No one really has the answer yet.  Ah, whatever.  Why don't we take a break?  Fuck.  We got some great DUI audio.  A nice little twist.  Oh, shit.  I didn't go driving after Halloween, did I?  That's your cue.  That was you.  Hit the button.  You.  Yeah.  You.  And to break.  And go. 
[02:13:30]  There, there, there.  Rage against the machine.  Jimmy, what do you got going on over there?  I have to plug it up.  I see you're fiddling about with your iPhone, too.  I'm fiddling with my phone.  Something's bothering you with the iPhone.  And, um...  I told you that iPhone sucks and it's going to let you down in the end.  No, I like it, actually.  See, I told you.  I was right.  This Friday, Saturday.  This Thursday, I'm doing panel on lineup.  But this Friday, Saturday, I'll be in Houston. 
[02:14:00]  Planet Houston.  What's that?  Planet Houston.  At the improvisation.  November 25th, Stress Factory, one night only.  Then two days after that, Thanksgiving, 27, 28, Boston.  January 15, 16, the Borgata from Martin Luther King weekend.  I'm happy to be going back up to Boston, actually, after Thanksgiving.  I have a lot of turkey jokes.  Oh.  Yeah.  I told you every joke.  Yes.  I finish with...  It's going to be a scream.  Yeah.  That alone.  This guy's a panic.  You don't even need material. 
[02:14:30]  Just go up and do that.  That's good to know.  Warren Haynes coming in at 930.  And you know what?  It's Monday.  I hope we don't have to talk to him too much.  Yeah.  Would that be a problem?  Like an interview?  Yeah.  No.  I would love it.  I like a musical guest.  I would love it if Warren Haynes came in here.  I go, hey, Warren, man, why don't you just jam for us?  Just riff.  And then he jams a couple songs and we plug his stuff and that's that.  And we go home.  Although he is the face of the Allman Brothers now.  I got to ask him about that.  Now, how is that?  I went to the Beacon Theater shows. 
[02:15:00]  He's not an Allman brother.  You know the Allman Brothers, they camp out at the Beacon Theater every...  Wow, it would be spring.  It was already six months ago, probably.  Fuck.  Man.  And Warren Haynes is front and center and the main focus of the Allman Brothers.  How does that happen now?  Greg Allman was never the most vocal guy when he was in his prime, but he's off to the side  of the stage, which he's...  Who's singing those memorable Allman Brothers songs now?  Well, Warren Haynes sings a lot of it.  Really?  I mean, Greg Allman's still singing his songs. 
[02:15:30]  But, you know, Dickie Betts did a lot of singing, right?  So he's fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  So fucking Warren Haynes is doing the Dickie Betts, but he's also harmonizing with Greg  Allman pretty well.  Yeah, okay.  So Greg is still doing...  I'm not saying Greg Allman...  Greg Allman's still getting the job done.  I don't want to confuse anybody.  But then Greg Allman will take a break and have a guest keyboard guy come in, like he had  that fucking Mendelin ring guy.  What the fuck is his name?  Or the way it is.  Help me out, Ant.  Oh, I'm trying to remember.  Sorry. 
[02:16:00]  I'm at a loss.  Holy...  Bruce Hornsby.  Oh, Hornsby and the Range.  So the day I went, it was Bruce Hornsby, and all of a sudden he's taken over for Greg  Allman.  So now it's like it's really barely the Allman Brothers up there, but still getting the job  done.  Jesus.  It's almost Warren Haynes' band at this point.  Almost.  Almost.  Let me see.  Warren, let's see.  Played lead guitar for The Dead in late 2008.  Yeah.  They performed at a benefit at Penn State for the then-presidential candidate, Barack 
[02:16:30]  Obama.  All right.  This will go well.  Nah, Warren Haynes, he's a cool dude.  You're going to love Warren Haynes.  He's a fucking...  I hope so.  He's awesome.  He's pretty much running the dead, too.  Is he?  He's the face of the dead and the face of the Allman Brothers.  Oh, oh.  And he also does that government mule thing.  Wow.  Busy man.  But we got some equipment set up here, so I think he's going to just jam, and we'll  ask a few questions.  I didn't forget about government mule, Cooper. 
[02:17:00]  No worries.  Hey, did we play the Rosanna Scotto shit thing on Friday?  I don't think so.  Wow, that was...  She's a potty mouth.  Wow, that was a great segue, and it just didn't want to play.  Yeah, it's good equipment.  What are you going to do?  What the hell was that?  I guess we didn't play it.  What are you going to do?  Let me try this again.  Yeah, that ain't happening today.  Oh, whose fault?  Head's got to roll.  Well, let me see.  Let me see.  I want to see a rolling head.  Let me see if it's the disc.  Remember Jocktober, A Tribute to the Hole?  What? 
[02:17:30]  If this does play, we're just going to let it play out.  Jocktober?  What was that?  Celebrate the end of Jocktober.  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents A Tribute to the Hole, the most unnecessary member  of any radio morning show.  That is tasteless.  Oh, stop it.  No, that's not fun.  Oh, that's disgusting.  It's like, oh, he's so hippy-dippy California, ukulele, dreadlocks. 
[02:18:00]  Not me.  There's this dude named Paul Unca.  My dog was the most stable man in my life for 12 years.  It's like somebody gives me truth serum in the morning and I can't hold back.  Random.  Oh, that is so tacky. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, so tacky.  I'm going to miss Jocktober.  We're going to bring it back as a regular feature, though.  Not like once every two weeks, once every three weeks, just so it's still there.  Yeah.  But that proves the CD player is working.  That means somebody fucked up by burning this CD here.  So now we need a rolling head.  It might have to be Sam today.  I don't know.  Is it Sam's writing?  Sam's feeling all big about himself that he won the Afro contest, finally. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  After five years, has it been?  I have no idea.  After how many years?  Danny actually cut his hair.  About two years now.  Two years.  The contest ended two years ago, I think.  Yeah, it ended.  It never really started.  These two wouldn't.  Yeah, it never started and never really ended.  No.  But Danny finally cut his hair and that's it.  Well, I guess Sam's just coming.  One with freakishly curly, frizzy hair is our own Sam. 
[02:19:30]  There he is.  Look at him.  Now he's running.  Watch his run.  Look at his feet.  Waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle.  He must leave tracks in the sand like a duck.  He doesn't need snowshoes.  You notice that?  No, no.  His feet are big enough without the snowshoes.  He's walking snow.  It's haircut time.  Is this you?  You're writing?  Pass the buck now.  Pass the buck.  No.  I always have a playlist.  Oh.  Oh, it's Iraq.  And then notice what he did also.  He goes, I always have and then added in something that's so convenient to have.  Iraq, is that you? 
[02:20:00]  Is that Iraq?  No, it's me.  That's you?  Iraq.  Iraq.  What happened?  What are you doing, Iraq?  I went twice today.  You're sabotaging the show.  Why would you do that to us?  He hit the button.  Nothing played.  Why'd you do that?  We've been so good to you over the years.  Why would you do that to us?  That was not intentional.  Why would you actually sabotage the show?  That was not intentional.  Then why were you laughing?  Yeah.  I wasn't laughing.  Iraq, I loved your Steve bashing in the email, by the way.  Oh, shit.  Can I defend Steve?  I have to.  He sent myself an email, which I didn't see, at like 9.30 that morning to ask us. 
[02:20:30]  And he probably hadn't heard back from any of us.  And that was why he didn't.  Okay.  Because I just realized later, I was enjoying the trashing, too.  But I didn't see the email.  Iraq had a good trashing, though.  I was wanting to read.  He should have answered the phone sooner.  Yeah, and I got a text while Sam was in the room about three minutes ago saying, hey,  did you call?  And that was yesterday afternoon.  Oh.  Oh, he's getting back to you this morning.  Yeah.  You know, you called him yesterday afternoon.  Uh-huh.  That could be a problem if you're the executive producer of a big radio show. 
[02:21:00]  He's Monday.  As much as we joked about Steve, you know, not doing the Mondays off thing anymore, he  does take a lot of Mondays off.  You know.  He just has stuff to do, I guess.  He just doesn't get to take every Monday off.  Did you get any tweets during the game, during one of the pitchers' conferences, catcher-pitcher  conference on the mound?  They started playing the virus's music.  Oh, great.  And all I was getting was Twitter.  It's like, holy shit, they're playing the virus's music. 
[02:21:30]  I'm sure I did.  I didn't look yesterday.  And there they were, out at the mound, you know, talking to each other, getting the  signals straight.  And I just Twitter out the Twitter, holy shit, they're playing the virus's music at  the World Series.  Did you say you made the Wikipedia?  No.  On this music?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Someone tweeted this to me over the weekend or a couple days ago, whatever.  And E-Rock is the last entry on the Wikipedia page.  Go all the way down. 
[02:22:00]  What does it say?  Danny, read it.  Word for word.  Oh, there it is.  Read it.  It says, the song is currently used as the theme for the character of the virus on the  Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is a completely overweight adult who seems more interested in seeking out hoagies  than just coming up with one single punchline.  Baby Elephant Walk serves as the music bed for this buffoon's pathetic antics.  He is self-admittedly, quote, not very good at this.  Look at that.  I'm famous.  You're famous.  Yeah.  Well, the virus is famous. 
[02:22:30]  So we got Warren Haynes coming in?  Yeah, at 930.  All right.  Can he just play?  Sure, if that's what you want.  We don't want to talk.  I mean, we'll say hi and stuff.  Why is it that radio shows have to talk to these guys, but Letterman and the rest of  them just go, hey, Warren Haynes.  And then at the end, you go, wow, that was great.  And here's the new album.  You get a Tuesday and they show the camera.  We'll be right back after this.  And then, you know.  Why do radio guys have to talk to these guys?  I have no idea.  We're going to do a little talking. 
[02:23:00]  You're not very good at this either, are you?  Little talking.  Little talking, lot of play.  Does anyone have a grapefruit I could talk to?  I'd rather do that.  Oh, that's so mean.  Well, why don't you talk back?  What am I going to say?  I don't know why they do a different TV talk show.  Talking, yelling, okay?  Talking, yelling.  How about you have a thought on that?  Yeah, wrinkly.  Oh, shit.  Wrinkly.  Wrinkly.  This is fine.  All right.  I have nothing on that.  Sorry. 
[02:23:30]  Come on, fucking pimple elbows.  Say something.  What would be the reasoning behind that?  They hate them.  That radio guys have to talk to bands and TV guys don't really talk to bands.  They just, they do what they do best, which is play.  Probably because it's TV.  They can come in what they do with the guests, where on radio they don't really let you.  Why?  Because it's not our show?  No, I think our new thing is to have bands just play.  We do a little chit-chat, but we're not going to do this.  You know, just because E-Rock doesn't know the answer to this, maybe the virus knows the answer. 
[02:24:00]  God damn it, you're right.  The answer to this question.  Why is it on TV, a band could come in, or a musician, singer, whatever, could come in,  they just play, and don't have to sit and talk to David Letterman or anybody like that, or Jay Leno.  And with radio, they have to sit and do an interview.  Do you want to walk through the door so you can be a character? 
[02:24:30]  I think you should walk through the door.  I don't even hear the virus.  Who?  What?  No, he's not here yet because E-Rock's still here.  No, he's got to walk in as the virus.  Everyone knows that.  He should waddle in.  This is so pathetic.  All right, what's the question again, and then we'll introduce the virus.  How come on TV, bands could just come in, or musicians, and just play without an interview,  but in radio, people are compelled to sit down and start yapping about stuff instead of just coming in and playing?  Ladies and gentlemen, with the answer to that question, here he is, the virus. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, God.  Hi, virus.  It's a virus.  Wow.  Hi, guys.  Did you hear the question?  Yeah, I heard it.  Do you have an answer to that question, virus?  Not at all.  You've got to have something.  You've got to have something on that.  TV.  It's a little strange that radio guys have to do very long, involved interviews with bands,  and TV guys, they just let them perform.  Yeah.  And then they walk over and go, hey, that was great.  Don't forget, their new CD is blah, blah, and you can get it blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:25:30]  Sounds to me like a lot of material for something a little funny.  Maybe just one punchline, anything like that.  Yeah, come on, fire.  I don't know about punchline, but it seems like TV commands more respect than radio.  You think that's the reason?  They can do what they want.  We don't do what we want.  But it's our show, so if a guest is in here, we could pretty much say, hey, welcome to the show. 
[02:26:00]  Why don't you play us a song?  And then when he's done, we'll be like, hey, thanks a lot.  And then that's that.  No one's telling us we have to interview people, but people assume that we have to interview them.  Why is that?  It's our fault in the end.  Yeah, I think you're right.  Because we should just say, hey, Tucker, play your stupid song.  You got something about that?  You got something on that?  No, I agree with you.  That's a great way to get out of it.  I agree.  We kind of gave the answer and then asked him.  We're kind of stupid right there. 
[02:26:30]  Damn.  So we set the virus up.  We gave him a good out.  We can't argue with I agree with you.  But how about an amusing point, though?  He's had no amusing anecdotes.  Yeah, yeah, something kind of funny about the fact that musicians go on talk shows, just play music.  They come on here and there's a whole interview and they're in on the hijinks that are going on.  Like, what's that all about, virus?  Come on.  An amusing point.  Go.  Really?  Yes.  Something like funny.  There's nothing amusing about any of that. 
[02:27:00]  There's got to be a joke in there somewhere.  It's your job to find the funny.  Clever comic like you should be able to.  Yeah.  Come on, virus.  Once again, you have been mistaken that I know a funny line for this.  Well said.  How about just an amusing point about it?  Like, you said you had to be a punchline.  Just something that might amuse us.  Go.  A bit of interest.  Let's go.  Time's a waste.  Quickly.  Come on.  Come on.  Anything. 
[02:27:30]  Please.  Something lightly amusing.  Anything.  Go.  Here's Rosanna Scotto cursing.  I get a little sick on those carousels going round and round.  I know.  And the music, too.  Makes me sometimes nauseous.  But still a nice visual treat.  Yeah, it's fun.  It was fun as a kid.  Meanwhile, I need to give a shout-out to Katie Scully, who watches us every morning.  I saw her husband last night, Bill, who said, big fan of the show.  And it would be, you know, really make her day if we gave her a shout-out. 
[02:28:00]  I don't think you're supposed to be a fan of a news show.  No.  Right?  That's just news.  Stop it.  Back to the virus.  Virus, you thought I was going to let you off the hook?  Go.  That was just a little interlude.  Amusing point.  Go.  And go.  How about Halloween?  You got something on Halloween?  Come on.  Yes.  Halloween.  There's a lot of material there.  What'd you dress as for Halloween, Virus?  Funny idea.  Go. 
[02:28:30]  Let's go.  Did you dress as anything?  Yeah.  What'd you go dressed as?  Your turn.  Talk.  What would you go as, if you could?  Yeah.  Not this character.  How about a funny thought?  It's supposed to be a joke.  An amusing thing.  Like, what would you go as?  Yeah.  A little funny.  Yeah.  What would be your ultimate Halloween costume, Virus?  Go.  And why? 
[02:29:00]  Please.  Just think.  Halloween.  Costume.  You.  Fun.  Put all those things together and come out with something.  Ooh, Warren is here.  Good.  Fucking A.  Hey, Warren Haynes is here.  Nice.  All right, Virus.  Quick joke.  Quick one.  Go.  Go. 
[02:29:30]  Halloween.  Go.  Halloween.  Go.  Quick one.  Damn, man.  I was just going to go to a home invasion story on the line.  The guy just fucking hung up.  Love home invasion.  Ends with dogs and guns, man.  Don't you want to hear that?  Call back.  Oh.  How about a quick joke as Warren is making his way in?  Quick one about Halloween.  What'd you dress as?  I didn't.  But what would you dress as?  It's kind of funny.  Yeah.  Go. 
[02:30:00]  Go.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I'm puffing and just.  It's the greatest.  All right, Virus.  Thank you.  Let him off the hook.  It's Monday.  It's frustrating enough when it's on a Friday.  On a Monday, it's almost unbearable.  It's almost unbearable.  Virus.  We got a DUI story that we want to get in before Warren Haynes comes in the studio.  Okay?  Right.  Check this one out.  Nice twist.  911. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  I should explain.  This is the actual 911 call.  It's not the news story.  It's the actual 911 call.  It's a DUI going down with a nice twist.  911.  Somebody's a really drunk driving down Granton Road.  Which way are they going?  They are going.  Towards Granton or towards Neal'sville?  Towards Granton.  Okay.  Are you behind them or?  No, I am them.  You am them?  Did you hear that? 
[02:31:00]  I am them.  Did you hear that?  She's turning herself in.  Yes.  To the 911 operator.  Wow.  No, I am them or something like that.  Them.  You am them?  Yes, I am them.  Okay.  So you want to call and report that you're driving drunk?  Yes.  Okay.  What's your name?  The virus.  Okay.  Hold on one second, Mary.  Okay?  Okay.  Are you still driving right now?  Yes.  Do you want to stop driving before you get in an accident?  Yes, I will stop. 
[02:31:30]  Okay, are you going to stop right now?  Okay, I'm stopping.  Okay.  Just saying.  On train tracks.  What's your last name, Mary?  Sorry.  Are you stopped right now?  Yes, I am.  What kind of vehicle do you have, Mary?  I'm just stopping.  Can I take my seatbelt off?  If you're stopped.  If you're stopped, that's fine, yeah.  I'm in park.  Okay.  A park.  Can I take my seatbelt off?  Yeah, as long as you're not driving. 
[02:32:00]  As long as you're not moving.  Can I turn my car off and turn the flashers on?  Just don't take the keys out of the ignition.  Yep, that's fine.  If you want to turn it off and turn the flashers on, so then we can find you.  That's an odd thing.  Because there's really no proof that she was driving drunk.  Right.  Especially if she pulls over, shuts the vehicle off, takes the keys out, and just kind of lays down. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  I would love to know how that ended.  Yeah, because even her call is like, you could speculate that she was drunk driving, but she could have just been like, oh, no, I called.  I was stopped already.  I was out of my mind.  Right, right.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I never drove.  I wasn't driving when I called you.  Yeah.  I would love to know how that ended.  Well, I bet she got arrested.  It's for the courts to deal with.  As much as I could find right now, I guess they did send somebody out to her location, and authorities arrested the woman after she failed a field sobriety test. 
[02:33:00]  Did they pop her in the shitter?  Yes.  She got popped in the shitter.  It's hard.  You have to.  Well, of course.  How do you tell if they're drunk?  If they go, ow.  It straightens them right up.  They're kind of straight.  Sobers them right the fuck up.  All right.  Should we get Warren Haynes in here?  I say sure.  Is this ready to go, though?  This equipment?  Who knows?  Where is he?  If the equipment's not ready to go, then we got to talk more. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, fuck.  Turn it on.  Today's the day we really want to just kind of listen to some cool music.  Here's Mars.  Mars, is this shit ready to go?  No.  I'm Mars.  Take your time.  Mars, is this shit all ready to go?  It's ready to go.  Yeah?  It's got an on switch or something?  Yes, it does.  See, management thing.  Why don't you just pull the goddamn plug?  Yeah, you pig-asset.  It's ready to go.  He just plugs in and we're rocking.  What fucking button does this come up on? 
[02:34:00]  And you know what?  We got to have the show on outside the studio.  I know management doesn't like that, but no one knows what's going on in studio.  Well, to a point.  Well, I requested that it be turned off outside after we got a threat from a certain lady because  she didn't like what she was hearing when she walked by.  And tell her to walk another way.  Of course.  Put a warning sign up.  You might hear some naughty language, and if you don't like that, then walk another way.  Hey, before I forget, do we have that Reverend Al wife and daughter arrest story? 
[02:34:30]  It is a good story.  Somewhere?  I just want to know if we have it for later because I...  Yes.  Later.  Well, right now.  I don't have any details on it.  I want to know.  There's the story right there in front of you, my friend.  Oh, God.  He's outraged, apparently.  Why is Reverend Al outraged?  I don't know.  He said unfair treatment of his ex-wife and daughter gets disorderly conduct tickets.  Unfair treatment of an ex-wife.  Are you going to read it?  I don't know.  What's going on? 
[02:35:00]  Who's in charge of the show today behind the scenes?  Warren's not ready yet.  He's waiting for a couple more people to come up.  Oh, he's not ready.  Okay.  He's not ready yet.  We got a whole band thing happening?  Are you prepared for this, Mars?  Might be a sound guy or whatever.  I think it's two guys, right?  Yeah.  There's just two more guys coming up.  Who are they?  So you're going to need a commercial break just to set up some stuff, probably.  I would think.  A little tweaking.  All right.  Go ahead, Aaron.  Reverend Al.  What do you got on here?  Reverend Al.  Well, apparently the Reverend Al Sharpton, our favorite race-baiting gentleman, lashed out  Sunday at the, quote, unfair treatment of his daughter and ex-wife by cops, of course, 
[02:35:30]  who arrested the duo for arguing over a traffic ticket in Harlem.  By the way, I watch a lot of TV shows.  Cops.  I watch First 48.  I watch Most Incredible, Most Outrageous, Most Dangerous.  I watch all those shows.  And I never see people arrested, like in Harlem, for arguing over a traffic ticket with the  cops.  So I, along with Reverend Al, am outraged at this. 
[02:36:00]  Could you just comply?  I cannot imagine how two unarmed women with no record could be taken in cuffs from a traffic  dispute with no personal or property damage involved.  It's, it's, it's, it's called, it's called disorderly conduct.  And they're probably resisting.  We will never accept unfairness.  Sharpton's oldest daughter, Dominique Sharpton, 23, and ex-wife Kathy Jordan, 53, were arrested 
[02:36:30]  Friday when they got into a heated verbal tussle with the cops during a traffic stop.  Dominique Sharpton sped past a police car on 8th Avenue and 110th Street.  She was beeping at it, too?  Blasted through a red light before cops nabbed her.  Yeah, she was beeping and swerved around the cop car.  Idiot.  Let's see.  She called her mom, who rushed to the scene to find Dominique in the back of a squad car,  Sharpton's attorney said.  Cops charged both with disorderly conduct and obstruction of a governmental administration, 
[02:37:00]  issued them desk appearance tickets, and let them go.  Good.  Sharpton wrote, there were no drugs or drinking at all, making their treatment all the more  worse.  Sharpton's lawyer called the arrest excessive and said the police car Dominique drove around  was unmarked.  Well, that's the chance you take.  I fucking blew past an unmarked going to the goddamn Midtown Tunnel. 
[02:37:30]  Holy shit, did that guy yell at me like I was a kid fucking got through the tunnel.  He's like, what the fuck do you think you're doing?  I said, I really, I thought you were a taxi and limousine guy.  He goes, does that make any goddamn difference?  You come over that fucking hill going like that?  And I'm just like, sir, I'm sorry, sir.  Yes, sir.  What was I going to do?  I didn't know who you was.  Hmm.  It seems they were arrested simply because they asked why the ticket was being given.  I love that one.  Bullshit.  Why are you giving me a ticket?  Why? 
[02:38:00]  Why?  Why?  Why?  Stop.  That's bullshit.  It is bullshit.  We all ask why.  Everyone goes, yeah, excuse me.  Every single one of us asks, why did you pull me over, sir?  I've never even had to ask.  Usually they go, you know why I pulled you over?  Yeah.  And you go, I got a pretty good idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got a pretty good idea.  I think you treat the cop with respect and you're nice.  And sometimes you get out of it.  Sometimes you don't.  And that was the actual tweet.  Al Sharpton, he tweets.  Well, this is what we deal with every day. 
[02:38:30]  We will never accept unfairness.  You know what the cops deal with every day?  People like your daughter and ex-wife who just won't fucking deal with the police the  way they're supposed to be dealt with.  If you do something and you get a ticket, take the fucking ticket and you got a problem  with it, go to court.  Go to court.  Confront the officer in a court of law.  And if you're right, they'll throw the ticket out.  If you're not, then you pay the fucking ticket. 
[02:39:00]  Don't sit there on the street and make a problem.  Guaranteed there was a, my ex-husband, Al Sharpton, this is Al Sharpton's daughter.  You got revenue.  What's your badge number?  You think they were acting up, man?  You're in trouble now.  You really think they were acting up?  I would absolutely guarantee it.  Yeah.  I would, not a doubt in my head.  Yes, Danny, that's what they were doing.  Can I read that one?  No.  Why?  Don't. 
[02:39:30]  I'm going to read that one.  Don't read that one.  What does it say?  They were, what?  No.  Act like, what?  They were freaking out, he put.  No.  Like, he assumes they were freaking out.  It rhymed with freaking out.  Well, no way.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Jersey, Jimmy.  Hi, Hope.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi.  I just want to say, gang, gang, gang.  Gang, gang, gang.  Co-fucking-Kane. 
[02:40:00]  TJ in New York.  TJ.  Yeah, this proves how big of a douchebag Al Sharpton is.  Who defends her ex-wife?  Yeah, that's true.  That's a bit bizarre, right?  Except for Ant, though.  Ant pays.  Ant doesn't pay anymore.  Don't skate.  Update.  Ant doesn't pay anymore.  Who's Al Sharpton on Twitter?  I want to follow him.  Why would you want to follow Al Sharpton on Twitter?  No.  No.  I was going to put nice guy.  They weren't.  All right.  You can speculate. 
[02:40:30]  Everyone can.  The Rev Al.  The Rev Al.  It's the Rev Al.  The Rev Al.  Good morning, Twit fam.  Oh, we got to reach out clips from the week.  Get the fuck out of here.  Is this really him?  Yeah.  Let's see.  Look at him just promoting all his fucking appearances.  Or.  Oh, well.  Wait.  What the fuck is he talking about?  Or drinking it all.  Well, this is what we deal with.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Here's the tweets on the whole thing.  Where do you start, though? 
[02:41:00]  He was told to stay out of it.  Dominique has grown and certainly can handle herself.  Kathy, the ex-wife, showed the concern any mother would show.  I cannot imagine.  Authorities were cuffed and then released after challenging police on a traffic incident.  Even though Kathy and I are not together, she remains my best friend and top supporter. 
[02:41:30]  And, of course, Dominique is our oldest child.  I met them with the attorney after the rally yesterday.  There's always a rally or some shit.  Did he have a rally over this?  No, this must have been some other rally.  Some other rally?  He's in D.C.  On his way to do the Stephanopoulos show when he heard about that.  Oh, God.  I got to follow him, too.  Got to keep tabs on what this motherfucker's up to.  The Rev Al.  The Rev Al.  On good old Twitter. 
[02:42:00]  And don't fall for that other one.  What's that, Met fan?  That's not me.  I'm the real Reverend Al.  Oh, that's the actual Twitter account?  I am the real Rev Al.  Rev Al!  All right.  Outraged again.  I'm sure they had...  You know, for the cop to do that, to cuff them...  Is the cop talking?  There must have been a fucking yelling match.  I'd love to see the dash cam.  Why the fuck...  Is the cop talking at all?  Why isn't he talking? 
[02:42:30]  I don't know.  They probably told him, just shut your app and we'll deal with this.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm trying to get dash cam footage.  Yeah.  I see what you're doing there, Danny.  I don't think you're going to get dash cam footage from there.  We are the worst human beings.  Shit, man.  Ah, it's unbelievable.  Is Warren Haynes ready to go?  We should take a break. 
[02:43:00]  All those people here, we should probably break and just sound check.  And then let them get set up.  All right.  We'll get them down the hall.  So as soon as we go to break, they can pop in here.  That'd be very, very cool.  Warren Haynes, of course, from Government Mule.  Pretty much running the Allman Brothers these days.  His part-time job is to help out the Grateful Dead.  That's pretty impressive right there, my friends.  Yeah, certainly.  That's pretty damn impressive.  Sightening is, sightening is.  Warren Haynes has been that guy for so long, man.  And all of a sudden, he'll be a guest guitarist that comes on stage. 
[02:43:30]  I remember seeing the Black Crows at the Beacon Theater.  And all of a sudden, they announced Warren Haynes.  And the place went bullshit.  Really?  They're fucking losing their minds.  That's pretty cool.  He's got a great reputation.  Danny.  Why are we watching monkeys talking?  You are an asshole.  I don't know.  Actual monkeys, by the way.  No, this must be some kind of footage from a wild country safari thing.  And it's two baboons having sex.  Yeah.  Funny stuff, though.  Yeah, why don't we take a little breather? 
[02:44:00]  There he is right there.  Warren Haynes.  There's Warren Haynes right there.  I've got a posse.  I'm pointing out.  I'm making him very awkward.  There he is.  What's up, Warren?  All right, we're going to have Warren Haynes on the show next.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got Warren Haynes in the studio.  What's up, Warren?  How are you?  He's way over there.  I'm trying to figure out what mic is his.  We've got a million mics on.  Oh, we're over here.  It's the big button that says Warren. 
[02:44:30]  Push that one.  Jesus.  It does.  Huge fucking Warren side.  Not even a joke.  No.  Warren Haynes, it's very early for you, huh?  A little early, but all's good.  And you were saying you're going to go to Berlin after the show today?  Yeah, I got a flight to Berlin tonight.  The Government Mule starts a European tour for about three weeks.  I can't keep up with you, my friend.  Yeah, it's not easy.  I can't keep up with me either.  Yeah, because Government Mule, of course, that's your main job for the most part.  Yeah.  That's the big one. 
[02:45:00]  And you guys got a new CD out called Buy a Thread that you're promoting.  Came out a few days ago.  And then you got side projects with bands like the Allman Brothers and the Grateful Dead.  Yeah, nice side projects to have, I guess.  And then I was telling the story when I saw the Black Crows at the Beacon Theater.  Next thing you know, Chris Robinson is like, ladies and gentlemen, fucking Warren Haynes.  And the place goes nuts.  You're always guest starring for other bands.  You know, the music business, especially in the circles that we run in, is a pretty small world.  So we're all friends and like being on stage together and stuff. 
[02:45:30]  It's a lot of fun.  Yeah.  I saw you at the Beacon Theater with the Allman Brothers.  I was telling Anthony, I'm like, he's pretty much running the band now.  I mean, Greg Allman's still obviously getting the job done.  But you're front and center.  And you're like the main focus when you're out there in the audience.  Warren Haynes.  Well, you know, when I rejoined the band in 2001, because I joined in 89, left in 97.  When Greg called me to come back in 2001, he's like, I really need you to come back and kind of step into that role a little bit. 
[02:46:00]  You know, because he'd much rather just play and sing.  You know, and he and I have been friends so long, and we've been writing songs together for so long that we know each other really, really well.  So he trusts me with that, and the band in general trusts me with it.  So it's a role that I enjoy.  Oh, you've got a lot of confidence on that stage.  Everyone knows you're in charge.  Greg Allman is nodding like, right on, Warren.  Take the ball and run with it.  But because he's off to the side doing his, you know, the organ and singing when it's his turn.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:46:30]  And, you know, he's sounding better than ever.  He's singing amazing.  Where does he go when he just leaves the stage for 20 minutes at a time?  That's a good question.  Usually to change shirts.  Why it takes 20 minutes, I don't know.  Yeah, you know.  By the way, thanks for the CDs.  Radio guys get treated like shit.  Nobody gives us anything, and you came in and just handed us signed CDs.  So thank you.  That's a nice thing to have.  Absolutely.  We never get swag like that anymore.  And for Jimmy to get signed stuff.  He loves it.  I know.  It just saves me the trouble of fucking following you down the hall like a three-year-old. 
[02:47:00]  I think you would like this, Jimmy.  Yeah, I know I will.  Throw this on your iPod, man.  Or your iPhone, whatever the fuck.  iPod.  Why don't we stop fucking around and get some music?  Yeah, Warren, you want to play some stuff for us?  Sure.  It's Monday, so we're more into just kind of hanging out and listening to you perform, if that's okay with you.  Sure, I'm happy to.  I had one more request for Soul Shine, but, I mean, whatever you want to play is fine by us.  Yeah, I'm happy to do that.  All right, good. 
[02:47:30]  Warren Haynes, Soul Shine.  When you can't find the light, it guides you through the cloudy day.  When the stars ain't shining bright, it feels like you've lost your way. 
[02:48:00]  When the candle lights of home burn so very far away.  Oh, you got to let your soul shine.  Just like my dad used to say, used to say, Soul Shine.  It's better than sunshine.  It's better than moonshine.  It's damn sure better than rain. 
[02:48:30]  People don't mind.  We all feel this way sometimes.  Got to let your soul shine.  Shine till the break of day.  I grew up thinking I had it made to make it on my own.  But life can take the strongest man and make him feel so alone. 
[02:49:00]  And now sometimes I feel a cold wind blowing through my aching bones.  I think back to what my daddy said.  He said, boy, in this darkness before the dawn, let your soul shine.  It's better than sunshine.  Better than moonshine.  Damn sure better than rain. 
[02:49:30]  The people don't mind.  We all feel this way sometimes.  Can't let your soul shine.  Shine till the break of day.  Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness.  Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul. 
[02:50:00]  A woman, too.  God knows she can feel like this.  Oh, when your world seems cold.  You got to let your spirit take control.  Talking about sunshine.  Better than sunshine.  Better than sunshine.  Better than sunshine.  Better than moonshine.  Damn sure better than rain. 
[02:50:30]  No, people don't mind.  We all feel this way sometimes.  Got to let your soul shine.  Got to let your soul shine.  Yeah.  Shine on and on and on and on and on.  To the break of day.  Right on. 
[02:51:00]  Damn.  Warren Hagee.  Goldstock.  That's my voice.  That's my voice.  That's my voice.  Ow.  Wow.  How the fuck do you sing at 10 o'clock?  Jesus Christ.  That's what I was wondering.  Damn, that is really good.  I'm usually singing at the other 10.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's starting.  Yeah.  And it's also got to be said he asked for tissues right before he came on air. 
[02:51:30]  He's got a heavy cold today and he belted it out.  All right.  We're getting swine flu from Warren Hagee.  This is great.  If you're going to get swine flu, you might as well get it from someone that's pretty cool.  You fly private or you guys fly commercial?  We're flying commercial and it's an eight hour, eight and a half hour flight or something  that.  So I'm trying to get some sleep on the plane.  Yeah.  You've been there before, huh?  Yeah.  It's actually turned into quite a cool market for us.  We only started going there about four or five years ago and we were really amazed at 
[02:52:00]  how big the audiences are there.  So it's nice to go back.  Yeah.  Very cool.  We got a novice question.  I don't know.  Definitely with a government meal.  What spurred the name of the band?  Well, I guess I could tell that story on this show.  Most shows I wouldn't want to tell it.  J-Mo, who is one of the original drummers in the Almond Brothers, gave us that name.  We were at a show in Memphis and James Brown, the Almond Brothers headlined one night and  the band was taken off and James Brown was headlining the next night. 
[02:52:30]  And so Alan Woody, the original bass player with Government Mule, stayed over with J-Mo to  watch James Brown.  And there was a segment in the show when he was waltzing with this woman with a rather  large ass.  And J-Mo was like, Woody, is that James Brown's wife?  And he said, yeah, I think it is.  And J-Mo said, shit, Government Mule.  And J-Mo's from Mississippi. 
[02:53:00]  Apparently, in Mississippi, Government Mule means a woman's big ass.  Okay.  So we thought, now we know what our name's going to be called.  That's great.  That's definitely a better story than I would have thought it was going to be.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Well, we, you know, right after that, she passed away.  So we couldn't tell anybody for years where, like, they'd ask you, what's her name?  Oh, uh...  Yes, dead woman's ass.  You don't want to throw that out there.  Yeah.  A little iffy.  But now the statute of limitations on dead woman's ass is going to be right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Add a little time, everything's fine.  Absolutely.  We've got a lot of people wanting to say hi to Warren.  Buddy in Atlanta.  Buddy.  Hey, Warren.  This is Buddy Fenify with Mellow Mushroom.  We're working a lot with Kirk and Kristen West on the big house museum that's opening up  next month.  Yeah.  It's an amazing museum.  It's the house that the Allman Brothers started in.  And did you know that Kirk was such a huge hoarder of every scrap of paper that's ever  passed through the Allman Brothers? 
[02:54:00]  Oh, absolutely.  Actually, Government Mule rehearsed in that house our very first rehearsals.  We lived there, and I slept in Dwayne Allman's room, and Woody slept in Barry Oakley's room,  and we rehearsed there in the very beginning.  So we're kind of connected to that place in a very special way.  So I'm really proud of them.  And they're obviously turning the whole thing into a museum, Warren?  It's going to be awesome, yeah.  It's the original big house where the band lived when they were just starting out.  No shit.  And they're turning it into a museum, which is going to be really incredible. 
[02:54:30]  A lot of great equipment, memorabilia, all sorts of things.  I mean, I'm hoping to go down there for the grand opening.  It's going to be quite amazing.  Now, has the house changed a lot since when the Allman Brothers were really hanging out in  there?  Well, they originally kind of restored it to its origin, but now they're going to make  it a very cool museum with all this fancy gear and stuff, you know.  But it's a really cool place.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Thank you, buddy. 
[02:55:00]  All right, man.  All right.  People are saying they've seen you with Widespread Panic.  Was that fun?  I'd imagine it's all fun for you, right, Warren?  Absolutely.  In Widespread Panic, we just did a lot of dates with the Allman Brothers and Panic together  this year.  It was a great tour.  The first time those two bands have ever played together.  Right.  You started and said, now, our information is very frequently incorrect, but you did start  with David Allen Coe?  That is unfortunately correct, yes.  You say unfortunately.  Was he unpleasant?  Unstable, a lot of things, but very talented and gave me a break that I very well needed 
[02:55:30]  and introduced me to Greg Allman and Dickie Betts, which led to me joining the Allman Brothers.  Dickie's crazy, huh?  Yeah.  We had a run-in with Dickie.  We loved him.  But then it came out, he got in some trouble.  And Dickie and I are old friends.  Dickie's the one that got me in the Allman Brothers in the first place.  Dickie is just happy to be alive all the time, that guy. 
[02:56:00]  But, you know, playing with Coe, I started playing with Coe when I was 19 or 20, and it  was just like being launched into this crazy environment, you know.  I would have never predicted how crazy it could have been.  I learned a lot, both good and bad, but it was a cool experience, and, you know, he gave  me a big break.  So his touring with him is kind of like, it's everything you think it's going to be.  As far as, like, there's girls and drugs and whatever it is that comes with, you know. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, I mean, not in the same way that you might envision, but absolutely.  It's pretty wacky, you know.  And for a 19 or 20-year-old kid, it was an eye-opening experience, to say the least.  I remember opening up for some, actually going on after some band, and they were taking forever  to finish up.  And, you know, when you're playing local clubs and shit, you want to get on.  You want to get on in a good slot.  And this band finally goes, oh, we're just going to play one more. 
[02:57:00]  And we're like, oh, cool.  You know, then they get off the stage and we can get on there and play.  And they go, yeah, in memory of Elizabeth Reed, the live version.  Motherfuckers, man.  Forever.  That could go 20 minutes easy.  That song could go, like, forever.  Oh, yeah, you could take a break.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Absolutely.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, what's going on with the dead?  Are you going to be doing more with the dead?  No plans as of now.  Well, if they do it again, you know, I look forward to being part of it. 
[02:57:30]  But as of now, there's nothing scheduled.  And did you meet Obama when you played with the dead back in 2008?  What did you think of the man?  I enjoyed meeting him.  And we raised a lot of money for his campaign.  I'm raising a lot of money for him now through my taxes.  It's fantastic.  Jesus.  But, yeah, I got to meet him twice.  You know, we've done a lot of those kind of things.  The Allman Brothers did Clinton's inaugural, and the Allman Brothers and the dead did stuff for Obama. 
[02:58:00]  I would imagine the Clinton thing was a lot more fun.  It was fun.  He knows how to throw a party at Clinton.  Come on.  He's a party.  He apparently likes it.  You want to get another song?  Sure.  What are you feeling today, Warren?  Let's see.  I want to remind people, sorry, the new CD's called Buy a Thread.  Everyone should go out and get it.  Okay.  Government mule.  In that case, I'll play something from it.  Good.  What's the name of the song?  This is called Forevermore.  Forevermore.  Warren Haynes.  And you have to envision it with a loud rock and roll band.  Of course. 
[02:58:30]  Of course.  I can feel the rain fall down like tears upon my shoulders.  I can feel the heart wind blow.  Blow on forevermore. 
[02:59:00]  I can feel the gods look down.  Some laugh while some are crying.  I can feel the wasted tears cry on forevermore  Can't you see  My whole world is nothing without you  Can't you see 
[02:59:30]  My whole world is nothing without you  Once in a lullaby  Up, paper sun was shining 
[03:00:00]  Now that it's all burned up  Darkness forevermore  Can't you see  My whole world is nothing without you  Can't you see  My whole world is nothing without you  Where will I run to 
[03:00:30]  When I need a place to hide  Far away from New York City  Who will I turn to  Now that our love has died  I can feel the rain fall 
[03:01:00]  I give on the shoulders  But I can't feel my love  She's gone forevermore  Damn  Had to turn the mics back on  Warren Haynes  Forevermore from the Government Mule CD  Buy a thread  Which is in stores right now  Great man  Sounds  A lot of voice right  Sounds really good  Let's go to Bill in Boston 
[03:01:30]  Bill what's going on  Oh Bill  Hey how are you guys  Hey Bill  Alright Bill  Hey Warren I just want to tell you  I'm looking at my iTunes right now  Download the new Government Mule  Uh huh  And I want to let you know  Soul Shine is such a beautiful song man  Thanks for keeping it alive  Well thank you  I appreciate that  That's an amazing song  Now again to an ignorant person  Soul Shine is from when?  Uh well I wrote it in the 80s  Uh the Allman Brothers didn't record it until 93  And then Government Mule did a version  Uh in 2000, 2001 
[03:02:00]  So it's been around uh a few different people  Who have recorded it and stuff  It's kind of turned into a staple on our scene  Yeah absolutely  Do you do covers?  We do  And when we do a long show  We do like three hours  And so uh we feel like doing a couple of covers  Is kind of cool for us and for the audience  You know if it was a shorter show  We probably wouldn't  But  What's your favorite cover song to do?  You know uh  There's so many of them 
[03:02:30]  I mean I you know I pull out like  Into the Mystic by Van Morrison  And stuff like that  You know  Uh traffic  Uh you know  Last uh  Night Before Last in Philly  We did uh our Halloween show  And this  I don't want to give people the wrong idea  This only happens on Halloween and New Year's  We do something crazy  But uh in Philly at the Tower Theater  We did 90 minutes of Rolling Stones songs  And uh last Halloween  We did 90 minutes of Pink Floyd songs 
[03:03:00]  With a laser light show and all this stuff  It's just something wacky to do on the holidays  Something different  Very cool  You know  And then on on New Year's  We always have some sort of theme  And uh  Uh  Turn the stage into some  You know  Set up that we've never used before  And you know  We've done like uh  What we call the Winter of Love  Uh the anniversary of 1967  Where we did all songs from 1967  And stuff like that  And this year  The  The theory is that 
[03:03:30]  The  The theme is relating somehow to Woodstock  Uh  So we're doing  The 30th and the 31st at the Beacon  And then on the 31st  We do our  Our crazy  New Year's show  If you want my input  I would say  90 minutes of Hell and Ready songs  Uh  Yeah  As long as you sing them  I'm kidding  Jimmy's a big Sabbath fan  You should do some Sabbath  Or some Ozzy  Or something  We actually have done  War Pigs  We've done  Sweet Leaf  You know  We've  We even 
[03:04:00]  The Allman Brothers  Even did  Dazed and Confused  In the middle of Mountain Jam  If you can believe that or not  And I do this thing  In Asheville, North Carolina  Called the Christmas Jam  It's the charity show  That I do every year  And this year  It's on December 12th  A couple years ago  John Paul Jones  From Led Zeppelin came  The Allman Brothers came  So we talked everybody  Into  In the middle of Mountain Jam  We went into  Dazed and Confused  With John Paul Jones  Playing bass  And the place went nuts  You know  Of course  Merging those two bands together  Is something nobody 
[03:04:30]  Would ever expect  But you know  This far down the line  We're up for anything  Alright everyone wants to talk to you  Let's go to Al in Maryland  Al what's up  Al  Did we lose you?  Al  Hey Warren  Hey  Good morning  Wow  Can't believe I'm talking to  Warren Haynes  I'm a huge fan  I saw your show in D.C.

[03:06:00]  No questions, Warren  What's that about?  A lot of ass-kissing, really  I want to hear a question  From one of these guys  Rob, Sacramento  We're hanging with Warren Haynes  Awesome to talk to you, Warren  I get completely gay  Over guitar tone  And I have to tell you  You know, when I see you live  I've seen you live  More than half a dozen times  And every time I see you live  Your guitar tone  Just makes me smile, man  You know, it's just a great sound  And you hit me right in the heart, man  I really love it 
[03:06:30]  Well thank you very much  And once again, no question  All right, let's go to Keith  In Louisiana  Keith  Hey, I hope I got two things  Actually, he does an excellent version  Of One by U2  On Live at Bonnaroo  Wow  Which I'd check out  But Warren  I hear a lot of Dwayne Allman  Of course  In your slide playing  And Elmore James  But who else are your influences  As far as slide playing?  Slide playing  Muddy Waters  And  Rye Cooter  And Lowell George  David Lindley  And obviously Dwayne Allman 
[03:07:00]  And Elmore James  That you listed  Right  There aren't as many  Great slide guitar players  As there are great guitar players  So the  Oh, absolutely  The list of influences  Is a little shorter  Who do you listen to now?  Obviously Derek  Is a phenomenal slide player now  But who do you see  As up and coming?  Well, I wouldn't say  Up and coming  But Sonny Landreth  Is one of the greatest  Slide players out there  As well  Oh yeah  Louisiana guy  Yeah, and of course  Luther Dickinson  That's playing with the Crows  Now is an old friend  And he's playing great 
[03:07:30]  As well  Right  And you know  I think we're seeing  A lot of young rockers  Coming out  For the first time  In a while  Right  Well man  I really appreciate  Everything you do  You're an amazing musician  Thank you  Alright  What is this slide player?  Where you put a bottle  On your finger  And play it  Emulating like pedal steel  Or something  Let's go to Rebel  In Mississippi  Rebel  Hey man  Hey  Warren man  You are the greatest  Fucking slide player ever  Thank you  That video  The video of you  And Derek  Playing in a 
[03:08:00]  You know  Like a dressing room  Kind of improv  On Old Friend  Man that is the  Greatest fucking song  I've ever heard you play  As far as the slide  Because you would  Blow their mind  If you could play that  For them  Well thank you  I appreciate you saying that  Well we'd like to get  One more song out of  I don't know  What  I don't know  I mean you did two already  Old Friend  Warren you want to do  One more for us today  Sure why not  Which one do you feel  Like playing  Well he requested  Old Friend  So maybe I'll do that  What's the back story  With this one 
[03:08:30]  Well he was talking  About a version  That Derek Trucks  And I did  At the Beacon Theater  In the dressing room  That's like a bonus track  On the live  Allman Brothers DVD  And on YouTube  It's quite popular  This is a song  That I wrote  A long  Long time ago  Okay  It's been hard times

[03:12:30]  When you're gonna let this poor man be  Oh, my God.  I'm blown away.  That just blew me away, Warren.  Thank you.  I've never heard that song before.  Where did you find it?  Let's see, it's on the Allman Brothers record 
[03:13:00]  Hitting the note  Okay  And it's just a  Holy  The two of us playing like this  Yeah, right on  As soon as I heard the slide  I'm like, oh yeah, that's what it is  Okay  Yeah, of course  That's great, man  Wow  I'm blown away by that one  Yeah, it's always cool  Because I'm such a narrow ass  When it comes to music  Like, I listen to three things  From the 70s  And then I just  I fucking stop  If it's not Kiss or Sabbath  I don't know it  And it's always cool  When you find somebody  That you haven't listened to  And now I want to go on iTunes  And just buy all your shit  Cool  Did you ever think 
[03:13:30]  You were born at the wrong time?  You got like  Such an old soul about you  Like  You should have been around  In the early 70s  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I mean  All the music that I love  Was from 67 to 73  You know  Right  That's my favorite area  Of rock and roll  Who in particular?  I like everything  I mean, the Allman Brothers  Were a huge influence  On me growing up  And then to join the band  That had to have been  So fucked up, right?  It was such a  Kind of a long process  That it didn't 
[03:14:00]  Kind of hit me  As much as it might have  If it had been immediate  But I joined  Dickie Best's band  In the 80s  And the entire time  That I was in  Dickie's band  The general consensus  Was the Allman Brothers  Will never play together again  And so I just kind of  Took them at their word  Never assumed  That they were going  To reunite  And then  In 89  I got a call  Saying  We're putting  The Allman Brothers  Back together  And we want you  To be in it  So at that point  I had been in  Dickie's band  For three years  Which was kind of like  A gradual 
[03:14:30]  Sort of initiation  As opposed to  Alan Woody  The bass player  Who just auditioned  And the next day  Okay, you're in  The Allman Brothers  You know  That had to be  That had to be harder  Right  Wow  Unbelievable  I think the Allman Brothers  Is going to go on forever  We talk about this  From time to time  Where like  The original guys  Leave or  Unfortunately die  Whatever  And the band continues  And I think we're going to  Enter a period in music  Where the bands  Are going to continue  And there's going to be  No original members left  Yeah  And you never know 
[03:15:00]  Because there's a lot of  Firsts going on  Right now  I think this is the first time  That kids and their parents  Like the same music  It's the first time  We're seeing rock stars  Do their 40th  45th anniversary  You know  We're seeing  You know  The guys in The Grateful Dead  Been doing this for 45 years  And it's amazing  You know  And Phil Lesch  In his 70s  Are out there touring  Is he  In his 70s now 
[03:15:30]  What is Phil now  What is Phil  He's got to be close  You know  And  He's googling  Right  You're googling  No  We're trying to figure it out  But I think you're about right  I should know  But I'm  It's early  And I don't  But  But you know  I think it's awesome  You know  John Lee Hooker was playing  When he was in his 80s  And I think that's  That's awesome  But  Who knows what will happen  With what you're talking about  A couple more phone calls  And then we'll get you out of here  We got Tim in North Carolina 
[03:16:00]  Tim  Yeah  Hey  Hey  Hey Warren  I was wondering  Well how are you this morning  Good  I was wondering about  Train  That song off of  Live at Roseland  Uh huh  That's just  Monster  I mean  That's  Amazing  What does it take you  To get through that  Well the original version 
[03:16:30]  Of Train  Which is spelled  T-R-A-N-E  Like John Coltrane  Yeah  Was on  Our first studio record  And then  The live at Roseland  Version you're talking about  The studio version  Was eight minutes  The live version  Is eighteen minutes  So  Within a year  It had grown  Ten minutes  It's one of those songs  That developed out of a jam  And just whatever happens  Happens  We don't play it  Very often  And we kind of  Incorporate a lot of 
[03:17:00]  Different motifs  Into it and stuff  It's one that  The audience likes a lot  But yeah  It is a workout  You know  Especially for Matt Abs  Our drummer  It's like  It's like  Playing a whole show  In one song  Oh yeah  And he's the man as well  Alright  Hey thank you Tim  Let's go to John  In North Carolina  Can I ask a question  Before you go ahead  If there's anybody  That you want to jam with  That you haven't played with yet  Uh  The list of people  That I have played with  Is  Thankfully 
[03:17:30]  Really  Massive  And I'm very grateful  For that  People that I haven't  B.B. King  Jeff Beck  Jimmy Page  I've met  All of those guys  Never played with them  And Carlos Santana  And I've talked about  Doing something together  But we haven't done it  As of yet  But that's my short list  Those are the four  That if you could jam  With any four people  Or anyone  It would be one of those guys  Yeah  Hey Warren  Something I've noticed  About you for many years  Why are you so down to earth  It's refreshing by the way  Well thank you 
[03:18:00]  And nice to see  But uh  Someone like yourself  Could be a real motherfucker  I think it was from  Having two older brothers  That would kick my ass  If I wasn't  If you changed  Yeah  When the fame came  Yeah  Or not  Just being uppity at all  You know  That would kick my ass  Right  Alright  Let's go to John  In North Carolina  John  Good morning boys  Hey  I just want to give a shout out  To Warren  Calling from Asheville  Warren  You make us proud brother  Thank you very much  I want to catch you 
[03:18:30]  At the Christmas jam  And that's all I got  And y'all have a good day  And happy birthday Jimmy  Thank you  We're hearing a lot of  Southern accents today  Because of you Warren  I noticed that  Alright so we got the new  CD by Thread  Government Mule  I highly recommend  Everyone go get that  Absolutely  You're not into the whole  Taping thing these days  Right  Well we do let people  Record with microphones  But the video thing  Is driving you nuts  No video  Yeah  But we encourage people  To bring their mics  And their recording gear  And trade as long as  There's no money  Exchanging hands  And we offer what we think 
[03:19:00]  Is a better alternative  Which is called  MuleTracks.com  Where you can go on  MuleTracks.com  And download any show  That we've done since 2004  Wow  And pay a nominal fee  For an extremely high quality  Version of it  That's so smart  Because any show you're at  It's like all bands  Should do that  Because if you go to a show  And you like the version  Of a song or whatever  You can just go  And just download  The show you're at  Which is a really smart  Smart move  Well the Allman Brothers  Do it in a hard CD form  Grateful Dead do it  In a hard CD form 
[03:19:30]  Mule does it  In a downloadable situation  And you know  It only makes sense  For bands that play  A different show every night  Because we play  You know  Our repertoire is like  400 songs  So we'll do a bunch  Of nights in a row  And not repeat any songs  Wow  That's the only way  It makes sense  If you're playing  The same 14 songs  Night after night  And nobody cares  Yeah Jimmy  When I saw the Allman Brothers  At the Beacon Theater  I saw one out of the  20 whatever nights  And then I went home  And watched the rest  Of the shows online  Oh yeah  The sound quality 
[03:20:00]  Was amazing  There was like  A seven camera shoot  It was like  They were on HBO  Every night  Yeah  It was crazy  That's smart  And we did  100 songs  At the Beacon  100 different songs  Yeah during that run  And a lot of the songs  Were really long  So  Yeah  How many nights is that  15  Jesus  They do a whole month  They do a whole month  At the Beacon Theater  I panic about one comedy club  If I'm gonna have  More than 80 people  I have a great feeling  To walk into 15  Sold out shows  Alright let's get  Warren out of here  He's got a plane  To catch  Berlin  Wow  Yeah
