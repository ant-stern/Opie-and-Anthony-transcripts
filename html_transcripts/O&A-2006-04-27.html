<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, hosted by Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, began with the hosts joking about their controversial past and introducing their crew, including Hurricane Ben and Martini Steve. They lamented the ongoing construction of their new studio, highlighting the smaller entourage compared to their previous, larger team that included lawyers, CBS executives, and numerous "O&A Pest" supporters.  They discussed their return to terrestrial radio, detailing the media frenzy surrounding their symbolic walk between the CBS and XM studios, complete with numerous photographers and news crews. They compared differing media portrayals, particularly highlighting a New York Post photo of Anthony feigning amusement while reading a newspaper. This transitioned into a discussion about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's decision to have a child in Africa and the paparazzi's access to the location.

A brief, interrupted call from Mary Jane regarding David Lee Roth followed, attributed to technical difficulties blamed on E-Rock.  The hosts then discussed their multifaceted radio schedule, encompassing terrestrial, XM, and college radio broadcasts, and mentioned gifts received from various entities, including Caroline's Comedy Club (though James Norton's gift was delayed). A debate ensued over playing a listener-submitted song parody dedicated to Jimmy Norton, stemming from a perceived lack of responsibility from the show's staff regarding listener submissions.  The conversation took a humorous turn with a discussion of coffee preferences, culminating in Anthony sampling a "Howling Monkey" beer.  A caller raised concerns about potential censorship, specifically regarding Anthony’s planned bit involving racial slurs and endangering wheelchair users.  The hosts discussed their relationship with Tom Chiusano ("King of the Dump Button"), their freedom on XM, and the difficulties balancing their various projects and personal lives. Further calls addressed their radio return, Anthony’s illness, and  American Idol, leading into an extended, humorous, and graphically detailed discussion on underwear preferences and bathroom habits, complete with a demonstration from Anthony.

A significant portion of the show involved a detailed discussion of underwear preferences, interspersed with listener calls and station promotion.  Opie voiced his strong preference for boxer briefs, and the conversation delved into crude humor about bodily functions and wardrobe malfunctions. Anthony's return to the studio was noted, referencing a past incident in Boston, and the show was punctuated by several ad breaks and brief comedic interludes.  A call from Callie, representing The Buzz radio station in West Palm Beach, discussed their format, listener demographics, and promotional plans, including potential future broadcasts from West Palm Beach. This was interjected by Eric, a co-host, eating what was described as “dumpster food.”

Subsequent listener calls covered various topics. One listener compared other radio personalities, including Howard Stern and Dave Ramsey. Another expressed concerns about Andrew Dice Clay’s negative comments toward the show; Opie and Anthony vehemently denied any wrongdoing and discussed their issues with him. A former "Whip Them Out Wednesday" participant shared anecdotes about her teaching job. Other calls included a Wendy's midget sighting and discussions about PalTalk's sexually explicit content, primarily from Arab men, and a listener's planned participation in a "dunk tank" segment. The hosts announced upcoming guest appearances by Joe Rogan and Bill Burr.  The conversation shifted to Jimmy Norton’s difficulties attracting women, particularly in Philadelphia, juxtaposed with his perceived success in other cities like Cleveland and Boston, involving explicit and sexually suggestive commentary.  The show addressed both positive and negative listener feedback with often sarcastic retorts.  The show concluded with further discussion of future plans and humorous anecdotes.


A substantial portion mocked Tyra Banks' self-help segments, specifically criticizing a show featuring life-saving tips (ATM attacks, car trunk entrapment), highlighting the absurdity and Tyra's fear of dolphins.  The hosts humorously acted out the self-defense tips.  Several callers and studio guests appeared: Vinny from New Jersey suggested a cruel, dolphin-related punishment for Tyra; Frank, an XM listener, promoted the show and XM; Rocco, a Hell's Angel, offered their protection.  The Monaghan Pipe Band made a studio appearance, escorting the hosts on a walk from their old studio to the XM studios, creating a public spectacle including interactions with passersby, a newsstand owner, and a Starbucks line, culminating in purchasing a men's magazine.  Other callers discussed the XM move and the walk. The show concluded with reflections on the walk and plans for similar segments.  The segment used offensive language and humor throughout.


A phone interview with comedian Pat Cooper dominated this segment.  The discussion began with scheduling a future appearance on Edge Radio, followed by a humorous anecdote about a mice infestation and electric mousetraps baited with shrimp.  Listener calls followed, one expressing initial concern about a perceived show style shift (later revealed as a joke), and “Marie the Trucker” shared details about her cargo and reacted emotionally to Jimmy Norton reading "tender sentiments" – encouraging notes.  The hosts discussed creating similar notes for their staff.  Pat Cooper's interview covered his career, past conflicts with Howard Stern (including alleged gag orders and sabotage), and various opinions. He shared anecdotes about his childhood, marriage, and interactions with other celebrities, using frequent cursing and outspoken opinions. The conversation was animated and digressive, covering his age, religious views, the entertainment industry, and personal philosophy.  A few other callers briefly interacted with Cooper. His interview concluded with his show business philosophy and experiences.


This segment again featured Pat Cooper, whose angry and highly profane rants dominated the conversation.  He recounted numerous confrontations, using extremely offensive language, with Howard Stern, promoters, and Frank Sinatra, detailing disputes over pay, accusations of insults, and perceived injustices.  He boasted about past performances and interactions with John Gotti, recounting shocking anecdotes.  Brief listener calls occurred, and the latter part included in-studio guests Dr. Ian Smith (*Celebrity Fit Club*) and Michael Strahan (New York Giants).  The conversation with Smith and Strahan touched upon *Celebrity Fit Club*, weight loss, and dieting, with Strahan's presence further fueling Cooper's explosive commentary. The hosts reacted with amusement and limited interruption. The overall tone was highly confrontational and vulgar, marked by Cooper's outrageous claims and language.

Finally, a segment featuring Michael Strahan started with a discussion about a sauerkraut-smelling Rolls Royce eBay purchase (allegedly masking flood damage).  This transitioned to a host's smoking habit, culminating in a bet to quit for six months with a $100-per-cigarette penalty to the American Cancer Society.  Further discussion involved medical topics: a listener’s suspicious mouth bump, and a detailed description of a host's grape jelly-smelling ear infection, causing reactions of disgust and vomiting.  Numerous phone calls involved listener questions for Strahan about the Giants, his career, and other players, and for Dr. Smith about his diet book. Significant banter included jokes about football, smoking, and bodily functions, with a running gag about the ear infection smell.  The segment ended with plugs for upcoming shows and books.

Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  We're dummies.  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[00:02:30]  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We, dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  Opie, I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You look like Chuck.  No, that is a...  Martini Steve. 
[00:03:00]  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Ross.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Er?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opie and A.  Shut up.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:03:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  Stop it.  Quiet.  I would like to just get to know you.  Hello, cutie pie.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello, cutie pie.  Dylan. 
[00:04:00]  Hi.  How are you?  I've never seen Ben run before.  I've never seen Ben run before.  Frightened.  Looks like a girl.  Who else was frightened by that?  Now it's too loud.  Ah, we'll figure it out as we go along.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  We like to call it the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM satellite radio.  And thanks to CBS radio.  Now it's really loud.  See, at this point, we would like the rage music, yes, lowered. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  You don't have ultimate control over there?  I don't know.  I really don't know yet.  Ultimate control.  We're still trying to figure out this studio.  I mean, the studio is not even built and we're broadcasting.  They're going to, what?  They're going to put up the ceiling over the weekend and the walls.  That's what they say.  To deafen the sound.  As soon as you move off mic, it's like a warehouse.  You get the echo of the bare walls.  Right off the bat, I feel so much more comfortable today.  Do you? 
[00:05:00]  And I'll tell you why.  Super agent Bob Eatman is gone.  All the other lawyers are gone.  The big wigs from CBS are gone.  The rest of the gang from X-Dem went back to Washington.  Did they?  Our entourage has been cut in half, thank God.  Yeah, who are those people?  I have seen it.  I saw more people walking through here in the past couple of days.  Leslie Gold, the radio show.  Ooh.  Now we got Leslie Gold promos playing.  That's good.  Ooh.  We like Leslie Gold, but... 
[00:05:30]  Not during our show.  But we're trying to do something right now.  Yeah, the entourage is down to the people that should be on the show.  So it's not really an entourage.  It's just...  No, it's just us now.  It's just the Open Andy show.  Because we've been walking around the hallways here, and I think a lot of people are looking  at us like, what a bunch of prima donnas.  That we have so many people.  Yeah, there was a point.  There was like 50 of us walking down the hall to take one meeting with Tom Chiusano.  Yeah.  And Tom's looking around, rolling his eyes like, you don't need security. 
[00:06:00]  I'm not going to beat you up.  Yeah, we had like two security guys in a sales meeting.  See, they're sales.  They're not known for fighting.  And we had two of them like standing against the wall with their arms folded.  But everybody keep in check.  I'll kick some ass.  Sales meeting.  Yeah.  So I'm glad that's not going to be happening.  Hey, right off the bat, how are you feeling?  Well, you know, yesterday, very under the weather.  Very under the weather.  Now I just have a sexy voice. 
[00:06:30]  I want that bass in my voice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, I'll kiss you and you'll get sick.  Literally, you'll throw up.  I feel a little better.  I think I'm going to blow the voice out before the end of the show, though.  It's one of those things where I woke up and I was like, la, la.  If I talk like this all the day, I'll be fine.  I just have to do my Joaquin Phoenix impression, which is really Jimmy's.  I'm just stealing it.  You sound more like Johnny Cash than he did. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, I've still got it, but I'll over-Medicate, which is good.  I do the show better high on some type of narcotics.  Yeah.  So I'll just keep that going.  Well, we've got a question right off the bat from Mary Jane in Connecticut.  Mary Jane.  Question?  Mary Jane, you're on the air.  Hello?  Hi, Mary Jane.  Hi, Mary Jane.  You're on the airwaves.  Mary Jane?  Are you listening to your radio or something? 
[00:07:30]  Mary Jane?  Just listen to your telephone.  Mary Jane?  Mary Jane?  Whore in Connecticut.  Mary Jane?  Ah, it's a great phone call, too.  Are the phones working?  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Greg in Philly.  Greg, what's up?  I hope the Anthony was going on.  Ah, she was the dummy.  It was Mary Jane was an idiot.  Well, she wanted to know what happened to David Lee Roth, and according to the ratings that  came out yesterday, absolutely nothing. 
[00:08:00]  I think she was going to bitch and complain because David Lee Roth's not on the air anymore.  She was?  I believe so, but the ratings came out for New York City.  Hey, Greg, go ahead, because you're just going to interrupt.  Go ahead.  Say what you want.  Greg.  All right, listen, we got a problem with the phones.  Hey, Greg.  It can't be.  It must be E-Rock's fault.  Everything was so smooth yesterday, and now look. 
[00:08:30]  Now look.  Now look.  I didn't push any.  Yeah, try that.  Greg.  Well, now he's gone.  Maybe he got discouraged.  Hey, JJ.  Yeah, this is JJ.  See, everyone hears us at first.  You can hear me, right?  JJ.  Yeah.  All right, that's all I need to know.  Thanks.  You're not even taking a spot.  You were used ass.  We just wanted to make sure the phones work.  But getting back to that girl there in Connecticut, what happened to David Lee Roth?  The ratings came out for New York City. 
[00:09:00]  First place was WSKQ.  Huh?  I think it's like a Spanish-speaking station, or it's like half Spanish, half English.  Spanglish.  Spanglish.  Spanglish.  What a wonderful movie that was.  And then it was 1010 wins.  All news.  And then it was Light FM.  Then it was Z100.  Then it was CBS AM.  Then it was BLS.  Then there was a tie with WRKS and WWPR.  Then there was WPAT. 
[00:09:30]  But where does...  Then there was WABC.  About where we're sitting.  Then there was WQHT, which is Hot 97, I believe.  Where...  Then there was WAXQ, Q104.  That's got to be next.  Then there was The Fan, good old Imus.  Then.  Then there was WPLJ.  Then WOR.  Then WKTU.  Then WQCD.  What?  That's what, CD 101 or something like that?  Jeez.  Then there was WQXR. 
[00:10:00]  Then there was a station that's called WCAA.  Where is that?  Stop it.  And then there was WADO tied with WNEW.  And there was a microwave oven left on.  And finally, WFNY.  That's where we start today.  We beat WALK FM.  Okay.  We beat a station that is only heard on Long Island and not in Manhattan.  There is a great starting point.  Oh, my God.  So, I hope that answers your question, Mary Kay, or whatever your name was. 
[00:10:30]  Talk about the basement.  Wow.  All right.  I think the phones are now working.  That's good.  Jimmy's in the studio.  Hopefully, Mare will call back.  I don't think she'll be calling.  I don't think she'll be calling.  We got to explain to everyone what happened.  We do like a three-hour show for the CBS stations.  We're on in seven cities.  Then we do eight hours over at XM.  Right.  Then we do 16 hours of college radio.  And then we come back here.  We just call into radio stations around the country. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  All day long.  Yeah, we haven't left the radio yet.  Live, breathe, radio.  There you have it.  So, after the show here and for the seven cities, and then we go and do our show on XM,  but we rush out of here right at 8.50 or a little pretty close to 9 o'clock.  We go down the lobby, and then the XM people hand us microphones.  And then we walk up the street to continue our show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:11:30]  It's only about a block away.  It's only a block away.  And yesterday, we had all our O&A Pest.  Not all of them, but a nice showing of O&A Pest that helped us with the walk.  We're going to do the walk every day in between shows.  It's our exercise.  Absolutely.  And eventually, we're just going to start wandering the streets of Manhattan.  Yesterday, we wanted to just get to the other studio as fast as possible.  But eventually, we're just going to wander around and go into Starbucks and talk to the people of Manhattan. 
[00:12:00]  If we have mics, why not?  Why not?  So, I bring that up because the press was all over this yesterday.  Yeah.  We walked out of the lobby, and the paparazzi were all over the place.  There was like, I don't know, eight photographers.  There were news crews.  There were the O&A Pest.  Yeah.  And they just started snapping away as we started the walk from one studio to the other.  And all the pictures are in the New York papers today.  Yeah.  I don't know if these pictures made it anywhere else, but I know they're in the New York papers. 
[00:12:30]  They followed us right into the studio, too.  Yeah.  Into the XM studio and started snapping pictures.  Like crazy.  So, Newsday had a very normal picture of Anthony and I just walking on the street with some O&A signs behind us.  Right.  And good old Club Soda Kenny just kind of in the background just watching over everything.  And it's a pretty basic article on our first day.  Would it say Opie, Anthony, and Big Dummy? 
[00:13:00]  It should.  Well, this is what I'm getting at.  So, the Newsday picture is relatively normal.  And hopefully, we'll get this up on opandanthony.com.  And the article talks about how we were good boys on our first day back on terrestrial radio.  And that it was a good show and that they didn't dump out, we didn't curse, and it was just an entertaining, funny show.  Okay?  We were responsible broadcasters.  Yes, we were.  And then the Daily News has a picture, which is different from Newsday, of our walk.  There's me and you broadcasting on the street as we walk up the sidewalk. 
[00:13:30]  And then there's this huge Opie and Anthony banner.  And it's an XM banner that the pests are carrying.  And good old Club Soda Kenny is completely covering the XM logo.  Kenny.  I'm sorry for ruining the picture.  Do you understand, though, this is what XM paid for?  This is all that XM wants out of the deal is some marketing. 
[00:14:00]  I repeatedly apologize to Mr. Hugh Pinero for being a thorn in his side continually.  That would have been a great shot for XM because it's us broadcasting with a huge Opie Anthony banner.  Everything's there.  And between our heads would have been XM.  Yeah.  But it's big, stupid Kenny.  You asked me the other day what my job title was going to be.  How about Guardian of the O&A Show? 
[00:14:30]  Do you like that?  No.  No.  I don't.  All right.  Okay.  I'll work on it.  Maybe you could get some regular broadcast media.  And every time they say XM, you could go...  Job title, blithering idiot.  That's true.  And the article that is with the picture here, O&A, minding their P's and Q's is the headline.  Oh, see?  The FNY show bows without a bleep.  They didn't dump out once.  And I guess everyone is really surprised by that for some reason. 
[00:15:00]  I don't get it.  Why is that?  I don't know.  It's our first show.  For the love of God.  You guys did a great job.  Just keep up the good work.  All right.  Thank you.  So did Kenny.  Feeling a little slathered here at the lower end.  And then the New York Post, their photographer, by the way, was late to the party.  You had all these photographers downstairs.  I don't even know who they represented.  Some were for the paper.  And the New York Post photographer was late, so you had to get a picture of us in our other studio there, okay? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And this is the whole reason I'm bringing up the pictures today.  The headline reads, O&A, back in the land of the free.  It's in the New York Post.  You can read it for yourself.  These articles will be online as well if you're listening somewhere else in the country, opianthony.com.  There's a picture of Anthony, just Anthony, in our other studio.  Now, thank God, because the other day you pointed out there was an article with just an Opie picture.  Yes.  We actually count how many pictures we have of each other in the newspaper. 
[00:16:00]  So when the papers come out and there's an article about us and we're supposed to both be in there,  sometimes I open up the paper and it's just Opie's face.  And I go, you know, why did they leave me out?  And this time, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's just me.  And it was so calculated.  I knew they'd use that picture.  Well, uh...  I played them.  There was about five or six photographers in the studio and the New York Post guy that was late. 
[00:16:30]  And I start snapping away and Anthony goes, I know what picture we'll make the paper.  And he lifts up the New York Post and makes us believe he's reading it and laughing along.  Because the New York Post, I think a lot of the bigger papers around your local cities,  they put the celebrity, some celebrity, reading their paper.  And it's supposed to be some big coup for the paper, you know?  And I looked ridiculous.  And I'm leaning back like, oh, let me read the New York Post. 
[00:17:00]  And click.  They snap it.  And there I am looking completely ridiculous.  What a fool you look like.  What an ass.  I am a jackass.  Right next to the picture, Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony knew which paper to turn to yesterday  when he made his comeback to terrestrial radio.  It's got a big, like, smile on his face.  And he's holding it with a picture of Alzar Cowie on the front.  Yeah, yeah.  You're just reading about the beheadings and chuckling.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:17:30]  And I did indeed look ridiculous.  But you purposely were trying to look ridiculous, mocking the fact that celebrities are caught, you know,  reading the New York Post and they picture that in print, like you said.  Yeah, but celebrities.  But you were mocking that.  You were mocking the whole process.  Yeah, because I don't, first of all, I don't consider myself a celebrity.  When they get a Brad Pitt holding the post, that's a coup for the paper.  This was one of those set up.  I was goofing on the fact that they do that.  And that's the picture they run with.  And what about Brad Pitt ruining his life? 
[00:18:00]  Just he's a I'll go on record.  I think he's gone insane.  He's gone completely insane.  She must be so good.  So good.  It must talk back to him.  It has to have magical, mystical powers to drag your ass over to Africa, to some desert in Africa, to have a kid.  Isn't that his baby in her?  I guess.  Like she's pregnant. 
[00:18:30]  And that's his.  He couldn't have one with Jennifer Aniston was the rumor.  Like somebody, apparently he's okay, but rumor had it that she was barren or something because they were trying to have a kid and they couldn't.  All empty warehouse womb.  So she gets pregnant.  Wouldn't you want, this is your first kid, the heir to your, you know, the pit throne.  Wouldn't you want it in a hospital, in like the best hospital in America?  Not a place where, you know, they're, they're shooting kids out by the millions and half of them die during like childbirth. 
[00:19:00]  And I have that stat because I have a mic in front of me.  And as you know, anyone that talks to a microphone is telling the truth and an expert on the subject.  But I would think you would want to go somewhere where maybe your first kid is born.  And if there's complications, there's somebody there that doesn't go.  And a guy with a drum saying that this is going to make your baby better. 
[00:19:30]  How about a hospital?  She'll be standing up by a fruit stand, dropping by a curb.  Llama walks by, steps on it.  He's whipped.  He really is.  He's whipped.  How do you talk a guy into going to, where are they, Nambia?  Who knows?  They're in some African nation.  No, what's interesting about that is a small African nation in the middle of a desert and all that, right?  And they're, they're really bitching and complaining because the paparazzi found them. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  How?  How did the paparazzi find you in a small town in Africa?  Or as white as they are?  Probably with a satellite photo.  There's only two white people in that whole part of the awful world.  Well, there's the answer I'm looking for.  But obviously the publicist or whoever is letting people know where they are to get the photo.  A little leakage from the publicist.  But they're bitching and complaining and saying, you know, we're not even safe in Africa.  You know, they're following us around in Africa even.  I think you could get lost in Africa if you really wanted to. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, completely insane, though.  How do you just run off to, that's how, that's how far, like, these celebrities have gotten away from what regular people even think or do.  It's that conversation.  Let's go to Africa, man.  Let's just go to Africa and have our kid.  It's like they're going to get pets in all these weird parties.  They want exotic kids to show up.  You know, it's like let's land in some place that doesn't have free-flowing toilets and grab something under the age of one. 
[00:21:00]  We'll name it.  Something that sounds like a desert kind of.  Most people just like if you have something exotic, it's in a fish tank.  It's a colorful little fish just swimming around the tank.  You're right.  They collect little human beings.  Look at its eyes.  What is it?  I don't know.  Let's just bring it.  Bring it home.  Name it something stupid.  It's ours.  They will diaper it occasionally.  All right.  We made the news last night. 
[00:21:30]  Good old Channel 9 was out there as we made our walk.  Here's what they had to say.  Opie and Anthony kicked off their new free radio show today.  The Bad Boys of Radio made a triumphant return to New York City with their show on CBS-owned WFNY.  The two then strolled down the street to their other gig.  At XM Satellite Radio.  Lots of New York fans were on hand to welcome them back.  Welcome them back.  Welcome them back.  Welcome them back.  What happened to their parents must be proud. 
[00:22:00]  Editorializing anymore.  Hey, let's say hi to Rich in New Jersey.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Welcome back to the airwaves.  It's been four years.  Thank you, Rich.  It's not so much that they want to have the baby in Africa.  It has to do with the swarm of flies that happens once the baby is born.  It's this chick.  She's nuts.  Carrying around blood.  She must pick the flies.  I think he's attempting something.  Could there be? 
[00:22:30]  Sir, was that an attempt at humor?  Well, it's kind of early in the morning, guys.  All right.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  And you've hit the wall, sir.  You know what it is?  He went to pull the curtain, like, off, like, and yell, ta-da, and the rope got stuck,  and the curtain just kind of went halfway and stopped.  He failed miserably.  He certainly did.  All right.  Let's go to Charlie in Philly.  What's up, Charlie?  Hey, how's it going?  Welcome back to airwaves.  You guys are great. 
[00:23:00]  Finally, a morning show that we can listen to.  Where?  Oh, us.  Jeepers.  Jimmy Norton.  Little Jimmy Norton.  I want to give you a special welcome back.  Tussle, tussle, wink, wink.  Oh, thank you, fellow.  You're welcome.  Billy does love Jimmy.  Yes.  The people there do.  Loves Jimmy Norton.  Yes, the family.  When he goes there and does his comedy act.  Yes.  Me and the teller sold out, by the way, at the Brugada, so stop emailing me about it.  Thank you.  Congratulations on that. 
[00:23:30]  Very nice.  Thank you.  I don't know if he had anything else.  He either hung up or the phone's just kind of crapped out on himself.  I think the phone's just get bored with us.  Yeah, we have, like, five seconds.  Click.  Done with you.  It's a weird situation.  We're just trying to get used to our new surroundings.  Like I said, every time you back off the mic, it's, it's, I mean, this is not a professional  studio yet.  That's why I don't back off the mic.  You just stay right here?  Yeah, stay there.  See, I need to move around.  People bitch that I'm too loud or something sometimes.  You want me to move your mic down or? 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  Are you going to listen to the listeners?  Are they engineering the program?  I don't know.  Who knows?  Who knows who's engineering this program?  I don't know.  We're figuring all that out as we go along.  Hey, we're a very interactive radio show, of course.  You guys know that.  And Spoonman sent in something that has something to do with little Jimmy Norton.  Hi, Mr. Martini.  That would be Martini Steve, wherever Steve is.  Attaches a little ditty tribute to Jimmy's ending from XM's first not simulcast broadcast 
[00:24:30]  with Free FM based on Sir Paul McCartney wing song, Let Him In.  Yesterday, at the end of our other show, this is very confusing, but eventually it'll all  make sense, trust me.  At the end of the other show we were doing, Jimmy was left in the studio waiting for his  gift from Caroline's Comedy Club here in New York City.  They congratulated us with bottles of Dom, fine champagne.  Well, there's a weird thing that's going on. 
[00:25:00]  I mean, obviously, we're getting a lot of attention coming back to terrestrial radio.  You know, and the press is all over it, and it's all Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony,  Opie and Anthony.  I guess that's the brand name, Opie and Anthony, and has been for many, many years.  But the show has changed drastically over the years, and now it's pretty much a three-man  show.  Yeah.  You know, it's Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  The press are like, yeah, whatever.  They don't give a crap.  In fairness to those dopes, they're really not supposed to know.  They're not fans of the show.  You know, that's their thing. 
[00:25:30]  It's like, who is this guy?  Well, I don't know if they have to say it like that.  But, you know, they're not supposed to know.  It's just, you know, you don't expect it from the press.  Yeah.  From, you know, YSP.  And there was a time Jimmy would try.  Like, we would sit down for, like, interviews with papers and stuff, and Jimmy would be in  the interview, and he would be talking, and he would be saying some wonderful things and  some very interesting things about the radio show that could easily be in print.  And then the article comes out the next day, and it was like he wasn't even in the room.  Yeah.  So, I figure, why? 
[00:26:00]  It's too needy to try to jump in the picture.  It's silly.  It doesn't matter.  So, I don't do it.  Mm-hmm.  So, then the gifts have begun to arrive.  Everyone is welcoming us back and sending us stuff.  And, well, Philly failed miserably as far as Jim Norton goes.  They feel so bad, by the way.  No, they shouldn't.  I mean, why would you?  I forwarded an email from Karen Buck to you.  Did you get it this morning?  I didn't look, to be honest with you.  Oh, okay.  No, she absolutely loves you.  Hold on.  Here's Ben. 
[00:26:30]  Yes, Ben.  I actually felt terrible about it, and there's something unbelievable coming to you tomorrow.  They don't have to send me anything.  No, no, no.  What is it?  It's over-the-top ridiculous.  It's unbelievable.  But now I'm going to feel guilty.  Well, let's ask Jimmy.  Do you want the gift?  Yeah.  Of course he does.  Oh, no, no.  He's going to want the gift.  Are you sure?  Yeah, of course.  It's not about pride.  I'm not like...  But I'm going to feel kind of bad, like, almost like if you feel like I didn't get enough  attention and everybody, like, lavishes attention, I need to kind of feel like a dick.  Like, all right.  Does it involve Black Sabbath? 
[00:27:00]  I shouldn't comment.  Of course it does.  Of course it does.  What else would it be?  I know.  That's the ultimate gift for Jimmy.  Anything that involves Black Sabbath.  It's one of Iommi's pubes.  And by the way, I still argue that you got the best gift from YSP yesterday.  Really?  Yeah, because you got the Starbucks card.  You could use that.  I will use it.  It wasn't even a monetary gift.  Are you implying they gave you nothing you could use?  I can't use any of those gifts.  Wow, that Philly's hat was fantastic.  I'm a Mets fan. 
[00:27:30]  And then the Flyers jersey.  My Islander friends are going to kill me if I start walking around with that.  And then a T-shirt that says Philly.  I would wear that.  That was kind of cool.  So I got a T-shirt.  So you got a T-shirt out of it?  And then a couple of homeless guys got some fine find.  On the walkover, we just hand this stuff out to homeless people here in the city.  I had a free FM shirt, and I knew that would get snatched up if I didn't bring it with me.  And I come back today, and lo and behold, it's gone.  One of the shows just grabbed it.  Probably gave it away as a big prize.  Do you still have your Starbucks card? 
[00:28:00]  Yes, of course.  I wouldn't throw that out.  I don't have my gifts anymore.  And then I had to steal Steve's gifts.  I got some U2 DVD, which is really cool.  And then I got the brand-new Stain CD that I want to check out.  Yeah, Steve got stuff, and Obi rummaged through it.  Like, you can't just buy your own.  Poor Steve.  He's got to drive a hybrid vehicle because he doesn't make enough money to afford gasoline.  Right.  And you're pilfering his gifts. 
[00:28:30]  Good.  That's what you should do.  Steve's nothing without you.  Good boy.  So Jimmy was feeling a little sad yesterday when we left the airwaves  because the YSP thing wasn't up to what he was expecting, I guess.  So then we went over to do our other show.  And then Caroline's Comedy Club, I mean, we take care of them.  They take care of us.  We've got a great relationship.  And they sent over some really, really nice gifts, some Dom Perignon.  Dom Perignon.  And there was only two. 
[00:29:00]  Now, Jimmy doesn't drink.  Everyone knows that.  But they could have gave you something.  Maybe a water.  We had our gifts nice and wrapped.  We had a card with them.  It was wonderful.  It was a card, too.  Oh, yeah.  A really nice card welcoming us back.  Cards are nice.  And Jimmy got nothing as far as that goes as well.  And we kind of told him at the end of the other show yesterday that his gift was on its way.  And he kind of just sat in the studio and waited for it for about 10 or 15 minutes by himself, very uncomfortably, waiting for his gift. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And you read some sentiments to get you through it.  I have, yeah, a box of tender sentiments, which helps me through troubled times.  We all have things that we do.  Some of you have the luxury of beating a child.  Well, I don't have one.  You just have tender sentiments.  Tender sentiments.  All right.  Just pick me up when I'm feeling blue, if I may.  So that's kind of the setup.  So Spoonman, hi, Steve, attaches a little ditty tribute to Jimmy's ending from XM's first not simulcast broadcast with Free FM based on Sir Paul McCartney's wing song, Letterman. 
[00:30:00]  Is this good?  No.  Oh, after all that, I just set this up for 10 minutes.  No, no.  It's not bad.  It's actually very well produced, but the –  It's well produced?  Yeah.  It's –  Is it funny?  Well, no, but it's mixed properly.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, Jimmy.  It's plenty of bass.  It's the first listener submission that we've got since starting this CBS broadcast.  Uh-oh.  And it's –  Okay. 
[00:30:30]  So why should we play this?  Because it's about little Jimmy.  Who's the first?  But it's not good, so why should we play this?  It's not terrible, but it's not.  See, here's something you'll learn.  Nobody on this show's staff takes responsibility for anything.  No one will fess up.  How is that?  No one will –  Well, because if asked, if somebody comes up with some bit of material for this program,  and you ask them, hey, what's your opinion?  You think it's good?  Well, Steve brought it in.  It's like, well, is it good? 
[00:31:00]  Well, Dan listened to it, and he thought it was good.  Like, no one wants to commit until it's played and it's a hit.  And then it's like, no, dude, I came up with that.  You just brought it to my attention, but I –  How is that?  Like, there are a bunch of –  How is anything I just said dodging responsibility?  Because you're not committing to this piece.  I will commit to –  You are bringing it to the table, right?  Sure, absolutely.  Okay.  Is it good?  Is it funny?  No.  Now he's safe. 
[00:31:30]  No.  Then why give it to us?  Because I was trying to –  So we shouldn't play it?  Nah, don't play it.  Or should we now play it because it's so bad?  I don't know.  That's a really good question.  Exactly.  Don't get the bear angry.  Somebody check if –  Maybe there's somebody knocking at the door.  Don't do one of the worst songs ever, by the way. 
[00:32:00]  Just awful.  You have integrity.  Someone's knocking at the door.  Someone's ringing at the bell.  Oh, really?  Are they?  But –  Be the best you can be. 
[00:32:30]  You are a firm-breasted something.  By the way, how is this well-produced?  Oh, my God, Steve.  I produce better stuff in college radio.  Compared to some of the stuff we do get?  Where's my gift?  This sounds like gold.  Oh. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's just the song with an occasional drop-in of a clip.  Do you know that most of the stuff that gets sent in sounds like it's being broadcast through a wind tunnel?  So when I hear something that's clean –  You're going on just pure production value.  Yeah, on that one.  Yeah.  So we might as well play an opera record that was produced well.  Yeah.  Do you realize that we dropped –  Did you want to break that?  Why would I?  Why would I waste the energy?  Just place it down and never look at it again. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  That we just went from 22nd to 23rd.  Let it be known, Steve's first contribution to the show stinks.  It was your first contribution, and you laughed all the way in.  You probably listened to it in the car and thought it was great.  It's actually not my first contribution.  My first contribution within this new CBS thing was a sweeper, and I handed it to Ope this morning.  Oh, I mean the first contribution of somebody else's that you then had to judge whether it was worthy to be on the program. 
[00:34:00]  Okay.  Fair enough.  You probably popped it into your hybrid.  You were doing 60.  You hit play.  You slowed down to 40.  That's a stupid vehicle you drive.  What are you following?  All right, Steve.  Thanks.  We've got to take a break here.  Yeah.  Get over all these laughs we're having.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Pull over, folks.  More song parodies coming.  That was horrid.  It's not too uncomfortable here today.  Yeah.  We're going to play a little something, and then we're going to take a break.  So check this out. 
[00:34:30]  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who? 
[00:35:00]  Who?  Who?  Who?  Who?  I invented everything.  Who?  I, I, I, I, I did everything.  What is this?  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee Diva.  Coffee Diva. 
[00:35:30]  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  What's going against the wall?  I'm not going against the divas.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks, Colin.  You betcha. 
[00:36:00]  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  And at least they're not funding terrorism.  Now, another O.B. and Anthony flashback.  That sucks.  What else did you bring?  He brought, um, wow, a black and tan beer called Howling Monkey.  Oh, come on.  Look at the label.  Where's my, where?  All right, here's my Howling Monkey.  Dude, look at the label.  Let me see the label.  It's a monkey in a suit.  It is. 
[00:36:30]  It's Planet of the Apes.  My God.  The label is adorned with the image of Dr. Zayas.  Damn you.  Damn.  Let me, let me partake in some of this Howling Monkey.  Ah.  Damn, it's, it's not bad.  My God.  The image of Dr. Zayas staring back at me.  Damn you all to hell.  I can't be drinking Howling Monkey. 
[00:37:00]  But I'm strangely drawn to it.  Drawn to the Howling Monkey as I was drawn to Zeri.  Lovely Zira.  Cornelius never knows.  He will never know what happened between me and Zira.  We drank a case of Howling Monkey.  And then I turned her into a Howling Monkey.  Yes.  I dropped my loincloth.  She saw the man with no hair on his body. 
[00:37:30]  I gave her some of Jarton's meat.  Yes.  I partook in monkey meat while drinking Howling Monkey.  Damn me to hell.  I like the Howling Monkey.  Well, is it better than the, uh, the Steel Reserve?  What's the alcohol content on the, I don't know.  All right, shut this music.  Give me Reverend Al's and I'll go back to the Steel Reserve.  All right.  We need a little more Steel Reserve. 
[00:38:00]  Wait a minute.  Give that to me.  All right.  All right, here's Steel Reserve.  Ah.  Yep, yep.  Steel Reserve, definitely stronger.  It's got a, uh, stronger taste to it.  Ah, that's gross.  The Howling Monkey.  You don't like it?  You don't like the Howling Monkey?  No.  That's a better one.  Now, is this, uh, is this, uh, sold in the communities too?  Is this in the community?  This was around here.  We can get this around.  Oh, it is?  We saw some stories.  All right.  Damn. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know.  I don't like it.  Well, the Steel Reserve will get you, uh, snot.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  If you want to talk to us today, uh, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's go to the phones, talk to Frankie in the Bronx.  Frankie, what's going on today?  Hi.  Frankie.  Hi, Frankie.  Yeah, how's it going, buddy?  What's going on, Frankie?  Not much.  I just wanted to know what you guys were going to do when that king of the dump button over 
[00:39:00]  there decides to start editing your show like he used to do this third.  The king of the dump button.  Hmm.  Yeah, Tom Chiazano.  So far, so good with Tom Chiazano.  Or as Howard Stern would say, Tom to Tom, Tom.  Uh-huh.  Well, um, we'll just see how far we can go, see when they start dumping.  And then we'll...  Or what about when they wreck your show, like when you guys try to put your genius or your 
[00:39:30]  comedy in and XRK just decides to, like, say, nope, that's not good enough.  Sir, there's no way they can wreck this show worse than our lack of ability will.  Well, guys, I'm glad you guys got a sense of humor about it.  But, you know, I used to listen to the, we used to listen to the Stern show all the time.  And, uh...  A few people did, I hear.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, and it just started getting so ridiculous with, you know, everything getting bleeped out  and everything like that.  I was wondering if it was going to start getting on your nerves the way it did with Howard. 
[00:40:00]  I'm sure it will.  Well, we're going to...  Yeah, it probably will.  And I'm sure we're going to butt heads down the line.  But at the beginning here, we're all trying to play nice.  But, uh, yeah, I see problems in the future.  There was one bit that I do...  There's one bit that I do that they...  I already talked to Tom about and they won't let me do it.  It's where I go on the street corner and I find, uh, people in wheelchairs of different  ethnicities and I scream racial slurs at them.  And then we...  It's a funny bit.  Yeah, yeah, I point, you know, we all laugh about it after.  And then I push them into traffic and hopefully they're hit by a bus and I scream more racial slurs. 
[00:40:30]  And he's like, ah, that won't fly and free up.  And it's great because it's a bit that has an ending.  Yeah, absolutely.  But, you know, stuff like that's going to be a headbutt issue.  Might be a problem.  Stupid man.  Now I'm thinking we should try that bit.  Yeah, well...  And you know one of our pets will try it.  I'll take a part in it.  I don't know, Frankie.  You know, uh, I think Howard could have done a better job trying to work around the rules.  He just...  He just kind of gave up on the whole thing, you know?  Well, I mean, after 20...  After 20 years of doing it, how long you gonna...  You know, how much of the rules you gonna keep up with after a while, you know? 
[00:41:00]  Well, that's why this is the greatest gig in radio, because when we really do get, you  know, very, very frustrated, we still have another outlet to just let it, you know, let  it loose.  You know what I mean?  Ah, the XM.  The XM.  Yeah, but I still think we could do some unbelievable radio within the rules that are in place here  and by the FCC.  You'll have to just wait and see.  We're just still trying to get used to our surroundings.  We're sniffing around the walls.  Like when you get a new dog, it just kind of sniffs around, takes a leak somewhere, and  you know, you gotta clean it up. 
[00:41:30]  Smelling seats, trying to guess which one Artie sat in.  You know, it's gonna take...  I don't think it's gonna take that long, though.  I feel so much more comfortable today than I did yesterday.  There's a lot less people staring at us.  It's really strange doing a radio show when the people staring at you, you've never met  before, and you don't know what their deal is.  You know, but most of those people are gone today, and it's a good feeling, I gotta tell  you.  Well, it's great to hear you guys on the radio, and you know, that's about it pretty much. 
[00:42:00]  I just wanted to hear if you guys were gonna fill in, you know, fill Howard Stern's shoes  really good over there in his old studio.  We understand they're, you know, big shoes to fill.  We're gonna do the best we can.  That's why we tell everyone that we're filling David Lee Roth's shoes.  That's right.  Right.  Which is a little different.  That's like filling Mabel King's shoes.  Yeah, well, I'm gonna be listening to you guys, that's for sure.  All right.  Thank you, Frankie.  I appreciate it.  Tell everyone we're back, okay?  You got it, bud.  All right.  And get those wows on your cars immediately.  Chuck in Kansas, what's up? 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Opie.  I got a question for you.  First of all, happy birthday yesterday, Anthony.  Hope you're feeling better.  Yeah, I feel a little better today.  Happy birthday today to you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  How come the guys from the Post were even allowed in the building yesterday after those  knuckleheads, for choice of a better word, were never shown you guys any justice in the  papers or nothing, and yet they get to come in there and snap photos?  Chuck, I can answer that, because we are publicity whores.  Yeah, at this point, you're right. 
[00:43:00]  If someone will print a picture or a quote, we don't care who it is.  Yeah, the day before, we were talking a really good game, and, oh, the post is here.  Let them in.  Do they need coffee?  Go get them lunch.  Make sure they're comfortable.  I'd do a thumb wrestling photo with Joel Steinberg if it were to get me in the paper.  I'm glad we get more time with you guys on the air now.  While you're speaking about wheelchairs, one thing I...  Go ahead, sir.  One more time.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  What, Chuck?  One thing I've tried to...  I was trying to do a gel.  It messed up.  See how frustrating it is, Chuck. 
[00:43:30]  That's all right, dude.  It's no big deal.  Yep.  I keep missing your point.  Do you like him or don't you like him?  I can't quite tell.  The whole head and nose bomb thing was really uncomfortable for a lot of people.  All right, Chuck.  Thank you.  Let's go to Ralphie and Glencoe.  Ralphie, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, Ralphie.  Listen, F Stern, tell everybody, when they talk about him, tell them to go listen to him  on the other station.  You guys, you know what?  He should fill your shoes, Stern, man.  You guys are so much better, dude. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, because we're proving that all right.  I'm such an ass kisser, aren't I?  You are.  Very good at it.  Yeah, but you guys are the best, dude.  I'm glad you guys are back.  I listen to you guys on XM anyway, so it doesn't make a difference.  Glencoe representing.  Big.  Yo, listen.  Do they call it the GC or something tough?  Glencoe.  See, I'm trying to be nice to you, bunch of homos.  I know.  Attaboy.  Hey, you sound like crap, dude.  Yeah, thank you.  Me.  Anthony's really sick.  I've been sick.  Oh, boy, boy, boy.  No, I'm just saying.  Wow, wow. 
[00:44:30]  Now listen to him.  Listen, if we, you know, this is very important that we started yesterday.  You know, if it was just a regular day in Radioland, Anthony would have taken off the  last couple of days.  Nah, you're good, dude.  Don't worry about it.  That's all.  Ask everybody.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Bye, fella.  I actually feel, and I think I sound a little better than yesterday.  Just a little.  Didn't I say that when I came in?  You kissed me and said.  Pace better than yesterday.  The day's healthier.  Did you at least watch American Idol last night?  Yeah, that was pretty much where I fell out, you know, crapped out, fell asleep. 
[00:45:00]  I did watch Idol, though.  No surprises there.  Get rid of the blithering idiot, Kelly Pickler.  Yeah, Kelly Pickler is now gone.  Kelly Pickler.  So we got, what, five guys left, or five contestants left.  You got a broad in there, right?  A couple of broads.  Yeah, Catherine McPhee.  And Paris.  And Paris.  Mm-hmm.  Catherine McPhee is coming out strong.  She might win the whole thing now.  I don't know.  I still think that Chris. 
[00:45:30]  The Chris Daughtry guy?  Yeah.  Jimmy, who do you think is going to win American Idol?  Well, I originally thought that it was going to be Clay.  This is how far behind Jimmy is with any kind of popular culture.  I know a little bit.  He's so self-centered.  You know nothing of anything.  It's not even, it's just, I'm just so wrapped up.  It's hard.  Do you understand that I'm very busy with doing stand-up and acting classes in this radio show  all in the midst of a horribly consuming sexual addiction?  How difficult it is to balance all that stuff. 
[00:46:00]  So I really don't watch most.  Yeah.  You know, Sopranos is the only thing I'm up to date on.  That's really smart when you're doing morning radio.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't watch.  Oh, sarcasm.  We don't care though.  I was all feeling good.  To not know about anything that's going on that everybody else talks about at work.  I know about American Idol, man.  I kind of kept up more than usual.  And Sopranos, the first time I ever caught up on a TV.  When's the last time I was caught up on a show at all?  Yeah.  Don't make, he's making himself sound like a hero.  Like, hey, I kept up with the Sopranos. 
[00:46:30]  You bought all the DVDs and finally got caught up when?  Well, I was caught up when Tough Crowd was shooting in 2003, 2004, in between suicide  attempts because this show was off the air.  And then I finally got caught up a couple weeks ago, like, watching this season.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone else pretty much right from the start was watching it.  Not little Jimmy.  No.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jim in Wisconsin.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, that's fine, guys.  Morning, Jim.  Thanks for calling the show.  Hey, nice talking to you guys too.  Long time fan, truck driver. 
[00:47:00]  We all listen to you, but this is killing me.  I need to know when does the other show come on because I could listen to Minneapolis traffic  and probably get a better laugh, guys.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Then listen to that.  Sorry, man.  Don't be sorry.  Just put on Minneapolis traffic and then drunk drive into a schoolyard.  What do you think of them apples, stupid?  I'm not doing my semi, but what time do you guys are going to switch over to your regular  XM stuff?  You already know what time we switch over.  So why would you ask?  You already know the answer to all those questions. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know the answer.  What time?  Well, then, do you know what?  Just sit in front of the XM with your eyes wide open and wait.  And just stare at it.  None of your business.  Just stare at it.  That's how you would take care of your regular listeners?  Yes.  Exactly how we do it.  What are you hauling?  I paid for the premium service.  Love you.  Well, then aren't you stupid?  Make a sharp left and flip over into a ditch.  Charlie in Cleveland.  Charlie, what's up?  Yeah, this is Charlie.  I just wanted to let Jimmy know that we didn't forget about him. 
[00:48:00]  We're sending him a present.  We're sending him a nice big Van Heusen sweatshirt.  Thanks.  Where are you from?  Cleveland.  Oh, good.  For those of you who don't know, every year my parents have a reputation of buying me atrocious clothes.  I still have.  I saw them recently for the Christmas clothes because I haven't seen them.  And I have the two boxes of shirts they bought me.  Just abominable.  Van Heusen.  No more Van Heusens, but you ought to see some of the collared shirts they brought me.  One was electric blue. 
[00:48:30]  And you would never, ever wear it.  Unless you're going to a Puerto Rican graduation party.  No, why would you?  It was awful.  And they're like, you're not going to make fun of this on the air.  I'm like, no, why would it?  I just wanted to come in dressed like that.  Let you guys crucify me.  You should definitely come in with one.  I want to see what you look like outside of just a t-shirt.  I will.  Parents should stop buying clothes at like 22.  Absolutely.  22?  22.  How about 12?  No, man.  Let you start picking out your own stuff.  What? 
[00:49:00]  How?  Yeah.  How?  Like you go shopping with them.  See, logically, 22 makes sense because you're not making money.  No, I mean they still buy them.  So you get the handouts from your parents and you get the clothes.  They still buy the clothes.  Hopefully you're out of college or already working on the job and you got some money coming in and you can buy your own clothes.  They still buy them.  You get to pick them out, though.  But Jimmy's getting clothes from his parents at, what, 36?  37 years old.  37 years old.  For Christmas.  And I don't like my parents spending money on me anyway.  I'm just like, just, you know, a book is fine. 
[00:49:30]  I would get the same stuff for every occasion from my mom.  She would give me like a big package of the Fruit of the Loom underwear and some type of boot, you know, Doc Martens or something, and a couple of shirts, things like that.  But the underwear thing, and we had talked about this before, had gotten so embarrassing because now she figures she's going to get me the designer underwear, you know. 
[00:50:00]  And it doesn't come in the plastic bag with the cute Fruit of the Loom fruity people on it.  It comes with the buff gay guy that looks like he's got an armadillo stuffed in his underwear.  Yeah, and it's one thing.  It's hard enough to shop for it like that.  But it's worse when you open up a gift from your mom and there is just this, a gym rat guy of questionable sexuality in just little bikini underwear. 
[00:50:30]  And, Mom, I got you this.  Oh, great.  Thanks, Mom.  I got you some porno.  Because it's the same thing.  It's pretty much, I could see gay guys walking into the underwear section looking around and completely being satisfied with what they see on underwear boxes these days.  Well, that's for the gay guys.  It's also for the chicks because they're really buying the underwear for the guys.  Are they?  When was the last time you bought your own underwear?  It's just it. 
[00:51:00]  It's difficult because I don't want to go up to the cash register with the box, you know, with my arms full of gay pornography.  They've done some marketing, I bet you, and they realize that most women are buying the underwear for the guys.  And they're hoping their guys can look as good as the picture on the packaging.  It's embarrassing.  They bring them home.  They give you the box.  It's got that picture on it.  And you put them on and pulled up over your belly button or the bikini briefs. 
[00:51:30]  I have been satisfied with the Fruit of the Loom Tidy Whities since I was like six.  I went from diapers to Tidy Whities.  It's the same as diapers.  They're awful.  They're not.  They're cottony soft.  What do you mean?  How high up are they?  Well, they're your regular standard Fruit of the Loom underwear.  What do you got, like four inches on the sides?  I don't know.  Let me look.  I got boxer briefs.  That's the way to go. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, boxer briefs are quick.  Boxer briefs.  Why are you showing us your underwear?  Ralph, they're actually fine.  How fancy are you?  Polo underwear?  You creep.  I'm wearing polo.  What?  Holy Jesus.  It's just come with a whole drill in the back of them.  Why are you taking your pants off?  This is a first thing.  I'm wearing polo because I thought I had regular Fruit of the Looms on, and I'm a lying sack.  Yeah.  Because now I'm wearing designer underwear.  Oh, these old things.  Polo underpants.  What a millionaire.  So these did come in the awful gay gentleman box that was in the store. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And my girlfriend did buy them for me, but I cannot buy these.  So I do have a lot of just standard Fruit of the Loom underwear, tighty-whities.  How do you find those in the store?  They're on the only mannequins that are bent over.  Exactly, Jimmy.  You're a boxer guy, though.  Boxer or boxer briefs?  Boxer briefs.  See, I don't like the boxer briefs, too.  You know when you go to relieve yourself, a lot of times you just grab the leg and pull 
[00:53:00]  up.  No, you don't.  And go through the bottom.  How do you?  Through my zipper.  I don't grab the leg.  No, I'm not talking about the cuff of my pants, you idiot.  No, no, but how far do you pull your jeans down?  What do you pull them down?  What are you, five years old?  You pull them down to your ankles?  Like you do.  I've seen it, idiot.  Wow, we're learning too much about Anthony right now.  No, no, no.  This is really interesting because Anthony doesn't get into this talk ever. 
[00:53:30]  No one uses the actual hole that's made for that in underwear.  You just pull down.  You pull down from the top?  Yes.  Every single guy in America does it that way.  I've done both, where you pull down from the top or you just, with your index and middle  finger, you grab the leg of the tighty-whity and pull up.  Well, that's logical if you're wearing bikini briefs like yourself.  No, regular foot of the loaf.  I'm not wearing bikini briefs.  Why don't you just...  They're a designer.  Tighty-whities. 
[00:54:00]  Take your jeans off and then reach all the way back between and pull them like down under  and up through the front.  Jimmy, you're making it ridiculously confusing now.  Just use the hole in the front.  No one uses the hole in the front.  It is the most inconvenient thing ever.  Ever.  That hole in the front was on those, like when people used to wear long johns.  In Little House on the Prairie and there was nowhere else to go.  You would go through the hole in the front.  It's the same design as in 1860. 
[00:54:30]  No one goes through...  You either pull down the top or you pull up from the leg.  Or if you wear boxer briefs.  Now, that's what I'm saying.  Boxer briefs, you can't pull up.  There's too much material there.  And boxers, ugh.  First of all, there has to be some absorbency to underwear.  I'm sorry.  You're not going to shake it all out.  So?  So if you're wearing boxers, all of a sudden you're feeling drip, drip on your kneecap.  Ah, who's looking? 
[00:55:00]  No one's looking.  Who's looking?  Who cares?  You don't have that dripping on your kneecap.  I never care.  Yeah, you don't want everything all just tight.  I like everything in a tight package.  You want to be able to breathe down there a little bit.  It breathes.  It's cotton.  It breathes.  I don't like things hanging out.  And you're more vulnerable to an errant swing that might hit the side of your leg in hot weather, you know, when it looks like a weather balloon, where it's really stretched out.  It could, like, hit the side of your leg and really hurt. 
[00:55:30]  I think Anthony's back.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, please.  He's got to keep it all.  You remember that time in Boston?  It's like a small Haitian family being smuggled.  Why don't we take a break?  We're behind in breaks.  It's a very interesting conversation there, Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  We're going places.  I feel it.  Yeah.  I feel it.  Come on.  All the way up to 20th place in no time.  How embarrassing that I was wearing my designer underwear today.  It is funny.  You're trying to be like the regular fella.  I was trying to be a regular guy wearing gold-plated undies. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Go get my limo.  I've got my herties.  That makes me sound like a really talented comic.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Only creeps listen to this program.  That's right.  That's a bunch of lies.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  It's time for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:56:30]  The Opie and Anthony show will return in just a moment.  In the meantime, enjoy the soothing sounds of Percy's face.  Soothing.  Calmo.  Trendy.  New Jersey.  you're checking out the opian anthony program we had someone from philly that wanted to bitch

[01:02:00]  good programming i'll tell you too it was great coming back from the break and actually hearing  some cool alternative rock music as you guys were coming back in well we like the alternative rock i  think a lot of people know that so that's good actually godsmack was on leno last night oh nice  yeah they're still doing it they did their latest uh single speak how'd it sound i don't know i had to  go to bed i got it on the dvr i'll check it out uh later on today no i gave opie a call about 6 30

[01:04:00]  that way opie and believe me he's still in mid-explanation oh i know he's still talking  and then he's gonna be like hello hello it's real quiet he's probably the explanation's doing well  oh that's weird i just had the phones fixed down here i'd love to know how long people ramble on  after opie hangs up like that it's got to be sometimes for a long time especially people that  are chatty cathys i like to just babble all right let's go to bruce in pennsylvania bruce what's going  on buddy hey what's up gentlemen welcome home thank you for your name i'm i haven't heard you guys 
[01:04:30]  since uh the uncle the knuckle and the tear stained pillow what you don't remember that uncle knuckle  tear stained pillow i mean i've referenced that type of behavior many times we got back on ysp  yeah that was old jimmy norton in the ysp oh cool hey um i was a big stern fan that never went with  howard the serious and just sat around in hell fucking oh excuse me wait oops oops there it is 
[01:05:00]  the first one the caller threw it out i threw it out i'm sorry gentlemen that's okay i'm sure al caught  it down the hall to catch it al hey i was wondering is is kid chris that's on at the uh in the afternoon  the same kid chris that used to work with you guys back in the day yes well he used to send some uh  bits from time to time and we played it on our show and uh you know he comes up with some really  good stuff yeah i was wondering how many kid chrises could there be in radio yeah you know what 
[01:05:30]  come on in radio there's so many of the same you know cliche names all the time yeah no kid chris  used to do stuff for our show back in the day yeah his show rocks too man hey what were you listening  to in philly when uh when howie went away and and we went away well unfortunately dave as far as i could  choke back to vomit i'd listen to dave and then just cruise through music stations well he had he had a  tough spot man i mean was it was it a bad show i actually never listened to it i mean it might have 
[01:06:00]  been an average show that kind of got a bad rap no david i mean you know what i wanted to give  david chance a big van halen's band wanted to give him a chance i always thought he was amusing in  interviews but i guess that just didn't hold up for four hours you know yeah it's kind of hard to  be funny just alone for four hours a lot of people are saying he just should have told like rock stories  like groupie stories or whatever and if he ran out just make up no one's because who's going to think  he's lying yeah so what you know wasn't what we expected we expected some comedy you know but uh 
[01:06:30]  anyhow it's great it's great to have you guys and kid chris and barsky man that makes a hell of a  lineup and i'm really enjoying ysp all day now all right right on thank you so much bruce let's  go to jim in new york jim what's going on what's up fellas hey jim you guys all right man i like you  but uh what do you guys think about jb and elvis i haven't heard like them guys we're too busy doing  about 12 hours of radio a day that uh you know when we're when we're not doing radio i don't really  listen to the to the radio the only time i'm gonna check him out now that we're on yeah we'll check 
[01:07:00]  them out now that we're on the same station but i you know i would listen to uh to like ron and  fez after we were done on my drive home so the only time i do the only time we listen to jv and elvis was  uh when i think voss was doing uh from he did our show on xm and then came over here and we said we  got to mention something about a forced miscarriage on a bus or something awful like that and he actually  did it and they laughed we thought they were going to dump out of it in panic but they actually they  laughed and had fun with it yeah they went with it so so to be honest um you guys ever have a 
[01:07:30]  problem with uh i i heard you guys didn't like andrew dice clay he was dogging you guys and kid  chris had him on and that's why kid chris thinks you that you guys don't like him that's what he was  saying the other day i mean no we have no problem uh with kid chris okay that's cool i called i called  chris and asked him because i know him for a long time we got booted off the air chris was in sacramento  and he was really cool with me when i went out there to do gigs and he had no reason to be cool 
[01:08:00]  with me because he was on the air and i wasn't uh and he was really a good friend so i was like i  heard someone said that he said this and that so i called him and said is that true and he said no  not at all so good and dice put him in a really bad spot you know for some reason dice decided to  start hating us we don't even really understand why we did nothing but good by a lot of people don't  like him neither so that guy's a bridge burner man i guess he was i guess he was all right i guess he  was on howard's show yesterday uh saying how he's gonna beat me up again bashing us stop because i 
[01:08:30]  talked about his kids i didn't talk about his kids i talked about how he's a bad father i left his kids  completely out of it he didn't talk about his kids he's a bad father is that it yeah he's a he's a really  bad father i wish i could do my dice impression now but i can't i do a perfect dice i could do sick  dice hey i got a cold hey look hey i got a sore throat usually i sound uh more like dice but 
[01:09:00]  hey i got a stuffy nose hey that hope he's in ass i'm gonna i'm gonna beat him up you talk about my  kids i'm gonna hit you now that's all i could do or you get no show tomorrow  that'll blow out the voice right oh my god i don't know i could do sick dice i guess hey some  nyquil oh oh my throat hurts ow i guess hickory dickory doc someone got a lozenge

[01:10:00]  know what happened but all of a sudden he turned on us i guess because he had to sell some tickets so  he went back on howard's show and i don't know i don't know he just completely uh destroyed us to  sell a few extra tickets for governors on long islands that's just like playing at the garden  good luck to you that's just like playing at the garden dice and then i you know i said that he's  kind of you know he's a bad father how he turns on people you know and now he thinks i'm not talking  about his kids look out he's gonna come and get you unfortunately dice is dead to us we honestly have 
[01:10:30]  no idea what we did to him to start this whole thing but i don't think anybody has to ever do  anything to him he just uh it comes off as a psychopath he gets something in his head  i get something in my head over here and uh he goes off on people that were just his friends  that's why you know you can't really look back and say who was friends with dice a few years ago  and see them as his friends now just doesn't happen yeah well good luck to you dice christine

[01:15:00]  your nostril i had a four-hour acting class i just came home after we ate and i put it on and i went on  cam with somebody and i pulled a jfk assassination shot in my own face and i dozed off i'm gonna have to  mount a stem and streetway sign next to my keyboard  are you on pal talk yeah of course yeah well when are we setting up the pal talk cameras i'm hearing  now next week all right they have to run some cable um but um for those of you that don't know 
[01:15:30]  it's it's uh one of these online uh video conferencing things that we've kind of gotten into  um and we have cameras and people can look in on the show and we can see them which is kind of fun  because girls will get on there and show us uh things show us certain acts um but a lot of it  unfortunately is made up of uh arab men who like to uh be naked in front of in front of their camera 
[01:16:00]  they just have the camera under the desk yeah no face yeah it's no face they don't but their name  is like abu laba muhammad abi and and then you just look at what looks to be the lower half of  a bear body because it's just all fur and uh you know he's working it i guess he's looking at the uh  the girls on the camera and just going at it like a monkey and that seems to be what a lot of bell talk 
[01:16:30]  it's about but that's something to do with the name opi right because the the name of the room  is open oh well this is just in in a lot of the rooms there's a lot of a lot of sex rooms because  at first we thought opi meant something in arabic or something there's like uh the the bbws if you're  into fatties you go there and you see fat chicks then there's guys looking for guys girls looking for  girls but in every room it doesn't matter what the subject matter is there's arab men uh that i guess 
[01:17:00]  are so repressed that this is their opportunity to go online no matter where they are in the world  and see western women uh scantily clad naked and uh they just can't control themselves so they just  start going at themselves and it's uh it's insanity and i guess jimmy is one of them because uh there's  girls that'll get on there and you know show do things they get on with their husbands or boyfriends  and and completely just go at it and um we've had people on the show uh if we couldn't get them 
[01:17:30]  into the studio they go on the pal talk cameras and do odd things at their house and we had one guy  uh and his wife on on camera uh she had a stun gun you know right now tom chiusano is getting really  nervous oh i know watch how this turns i will try to navigate this treacherous water getting all  nervous in his office right now had a stun gun and uh this guy's forte his little thing his show 
[01:18:00]  that he would do on pal talk is letting his wife stun gun him in a place that hurts a lot when you get  kicked in it and that's what she did just whammo slammed it and the guy dropped the guy dropped right  to the ground convulsed and it was hysterical and not to be outdone he he then got up and uh we requested  that um he spin around and she stunned gundam there and he he like he bent over and she stunned gundam 
[01:18:30]  and he flew headfirst into his wall and put a hole in his plaster wall it's better than the moon landing footage  oh absolutely and then you can go that you could see that and then you could do what jimmy does go  make friends with some girls on there uh go to private rooms with the girls um take your clothes  off and you know anything goes exactly and it's not like the old days i remember something called see you 
[01:19:00]  see me it was the first video conferencing and it stunk it was like uh bad animation you know you get  like one picture refreshing every five seconds where's the fun in that but this it's really  smooth and stuff we've been using it for the show so uh i think next week we'll have it hooked up by  monday we'll have uh the pal talk cameras live in studio yep over here at least we already have them  at the other place yeah all right why don't we take a break you're listening to the opian anthony  program and uh we'll do something after these messages

[01:21:00]  so we're happy you tuned in it's going to be up to them to figure it all out to figure it all out  we don't have enough time to thank you to explain everything i ain't recapping now this show goes by  really fast the first part of our radio show and then we go over to xm satellite radio and continue  over there but tomorrow it's joe rogan and also we're going to bring by uh big a and twitchels to  do the news from the dunking booth and also they're going to do uh yo mama jokes yeah i know you're 
[01:21:30]  rolling your eyes out there trust me it'll be uh very very entertaining and bill burr stopping by  tomorrow to say hi we're being heard on um a fine station in cleveland and we got kim monroe on the uh  the phone right now kim what's going on not too much how you guys doing welcome back to cleveland  thank you kim what color is your hair today uh well it's actually going to change later this  afternoon but right now it's uh a pinkish red pinkish red all right yeah how did you know that  opie how did you know to ask her about her hair color because i take notice oh wait you were never 
[01:22:00]  up there i was never here oh okay i was never there you've never met uh kim monroe oh all right  when i was on the road with jimmy just kind of hanging out and watching him you know be a star  uh see we had two years off and and opie did stuff studio and i didn't anthony had a girlfriend and opie  and i had each other great well it's it's the truth sometimes we even get separate rooms on the 
[01:22:30]  road oh wow must have been lonely yeah start that rumor that's terrific so uh jimmy played cleveland  i went up there and we had to do rover's uh morning show yep right and i was allowed to sit in the studio  because the company that fired us you know this is a radio station that was one of theirs yeah so we  went by the station so jimmy could be a star doing the whole morning show with uh rover and i was  allowed to sit there as long as i didn't say a word you could not speak so for four hours i was it was 
[01:23:00]  killing me yeah i just want to jump in there and do some radio with the guys and uh i wasn't allowed  but kim monroe had like uh i think purple hair back then really something something pretty crazy  it changes colors a lot what do you do that for because it's hair and it's fun and why not it's your  natural color i couldn't tell you right now really i really have no idea you know what that means  mousy brown it's mousy brown all the girls with mousy brown hair uh diet another color i like 
[01:23:30]  cleveland girls too the best girls are pretty wild yeah cleveland and boston girls are the best in the  country yeah yeah i even remember as a kid going on vacation with the family and people would go  where are you from i'm like ohio they're like oh one of those girls i'm like what is that goers  is that what you're saying jimmy i don't know about that they don't just tease they go yeah well i don't  know they're all goers but the ones that claim to be are i'm like philadelphia who a city is probably 
[01:24:00]  my favorite city i love philadelphia but the girls there do they never and i mean it doesn't i've had  2 000 people in an audience and struck out i gotta explain though basically what he's saying is the  girls in philly have morals yeah but he's calling all the girls in cleveland sluts i'm not i'm not  boston has the sluts cleveland has the sluts philly girls have the morals and and then yeah that doesn't  make jimmy happy no no it's like if you claim to be something if you claim to be a certain way 
[01:24:30]  don't get me interested by presenting yourself a certain way and then when i approach you go teehee  you know and run away with your jimmy to you though presenting in a certain way is going hi i  enjoyed your show then you think you know you're starting to think about going back to a hotel room  and i'm pretty accurate dude i know when they're giving me certain signals just for the attention  you know when they are and believe me in philly there's just been too many situations and the  girls are hot but they just you know hey what's going on what's going on they're getting nothing 
[01:25:00]  so cleveland and boston you know i'm not saying i have a great batting average there  yeah you know the girls that show up you know they bang i've introduced jimmy to girls in philly  and uh he gets really mad because after an hour of just hanging out having a couple drinks whatever  what you know whatever we're doing that the girls uh or whatever won't go back to the hotel with him  and he gets so pissed off and i'm like jimmy it was an hour i saw it once it was an hour we're just  hanging out we hung out one time at a diner in new york and there was a girl from philly who's a nice 
[01:25:30]  girl but i i didn't want to i i wouldn't i would have made out with her but i wasn't looking to  like have sex and believe me i know when i'm in like completely filth vibe but with this girl she  was kind of cool i was getting some kind of vibes off her so she was staying not far from where i  live and so we were walking by and i'm like why don't you come over for a little while it was late  um it's four in the morning all right i'll be late late but i wasn't gonna try to i would have  fooled around with her and made out or something but i wasn't gonna try to have sex with her i mean  i'll tell you even that now in hindsight and she's like oh i can't i can't and i just can't 
[01:26:00]  i'm 37 what what what i don't know should we have our parents meet first and approve it you dope  just either come over and make out or beat it like what am i why would i want to have a coffee with  her like it's 19 should i pin my give her my pin here wear this hon and wear my sweater i mean you  should be disappointed on it for die you should be disappointed to a point but you really take it  seriously and personally i do i just hate to i mean i saw him walking across the street after  she said no and you could just see how pissed off and angry you are because it was another philly 
[01:26:30]  girl who gives you vibes like real good vibes and uh and then nothing call me in why would i do that  for what so i can waste another complete night having coffee with with my grandmother for what  you can't have the whore mentality all the time but no i said what there's guys out there that gotta  work at it i wasn't looking for sex most guys have to work at it who are we kidding we all do  i have to work maybe if you called her and had another little uh date or what have you then you  would have got some action but i had met her before she was somebody i maybe i would have taken 
[01:27:00]  three times then oh my god in your world that's crazy right right for a kiss yeah for sex if you  really like somebody i understand that but it's like just to make out to hang out it's almost like  i'm not gonna rape you stupid just come over we'll make out and end up fine and then you leave  i'll yell you know i'll yell whore and i'll just close the door on you  yeah you just uh you're you're socially a little off jimmy it's not you're not the norm you know  no but i know i know when i'm expecting unrealistic sex and it's kind of my own 
[01:27:30]  silliness and i know like when genuinely like come on just to come over and make out for a little while  but she was worried about everyone else would think of her and it's like and again i'm old enough to  know like if you're worried about other your friends are going to think of you i can't i can't do it  but look you're you're contradicting yourself just about why because you're saying you just  come over and make out again what are you 12 but no kissing is fun and then she thinks that after  the kissing you're just gonna let her go or is there duct tape and a shovel not in her future 
[01:28:00]  a shallow grave if the kissing's going well you're obviously gonna try for more yeah well that's our  that's our jobs yeah and that's our jobs that's what we do it's it's it's all we do i saw him  work some girl at a hot tub in california once some canadian girl yeah real cute just hanging out  in her little bikini and everyone's got their little tootsies in the hot water and jim is just  working her and working her working her and and just basic conversation and she goes oh well uh i gotta 
[01:28:30]  get up you know early for something tomorrow so have a good night she gets up and walk away and  he was so angry with himself starting to second guess every word that came out of his stupid mouth  because i know when i'm getting vibes and i blew it there's let me tell you something i am the king  of like getting like almost somewhere nobody gets closer and flops better than i do i'm amazingly  awful at closing the deal yeah yeah i remember when you were in cleveland one time we had a girl who 
[01:29:00]  worked in the promotion department total hottie long blonde hair um i definitely thought you were  way hitting on her in fact we have a picture hanging up still in the promotion office of you  standing next to her i think you came up to about chest level and your eyeballs were focused  and it's we have it hanging up it's it's our shrine i remember her i was really hot really sexy but 
[01:29:30]  again promotions department she was being fun and flirty um and but i i knew what that was all  along like a lot of times the girls just they see that they want to play and have fun and be like  oh look at i'm hitting on you lol and they just don't understand what an addict they're dealing  with i want to make sure there's the problem because in the real world all that stuff happens  with jimmy he takes it so seriously and so personally it just drives me nuts it drives him yeah i think  all women are flirts by nature all of them yeah but jimmy don't flirting to him is you better sleep 
[01:30:00]  with me flirting is okay i understand harmless flirting but i also understand when somebody's  doing something to try to get a reaction um you know i mean if you're trying to get a reaction you're  trying to get something then don't get mad at me when i want to take you back to the room girls do  though i know just like we do what opie said you know after making out unless you're 12 years old  making out's fine at 12 you know when you're a kid uh but you know once you get a little older  it's supposed to go a little further so what they don't have to do anything sometimes i'll go look 
[01:30:30]  just stand over there and watch me did you just see you are a creep i'm like look just stand over  there watch here's what i need you to do just put on that catholic school girl outfit pretend you're  tied up just cry and watch me that's all i need you to do i know jimmy well enough to know  oh that's the absolute truth oh i'm awful i love to be watched makes me very happy  so kim what's stop stop with that you rubs uh so kim what's the vibe in cleveland 
[01:31:00]  man it's been great as soon as we made the announcement on monday we had people calling in  like they were a little bit confused like wait a minute what's going on they're going to be on in  the morning they're going to be on in the afternoon what's happening you know so there was a little bit  of confusion but by and large people were just calling up one call i had in particular a guy  must have said thank you about 37 times oh that's awesome so glad and so happy so you know i mean i  i was shocked when i heard the news um that well you know a week or two weeks ago when it was leaked 
[01:31:30]  everywhere um couldn't believe it and then i was just like when they told me for sure i was like  hell yeah bring it on hey uh by the way how's the homeless situation in cleveland oh it's still bad  yeah because uh i went up there with jimmy uh a couple times actually for some gigs and we would  you know we would be in a nice hotel in downtown cleveland you can't even leave your hotel and you  get attacked immediately oh yeah and right now it's even really a lot worse by the building where 
[01:32:00]  the station is because um there's a film crew on euclid avenue they're filming um some location shots  for spider-man 3 so they've got the street dressed up to look like new york city there's  new york cabs so obviously that's the place where they're all hanging out right now i think  that's where brad pitt and angelina jolie go to adopt kids downtown cleveland they could  might have been funnier if i didn't trip over angelina jolie they could just hang out in our  building because all of them are hanging out inside the building standing in the windows 
[01:32:30]  watching what's going on too yeah it really is uncomfortable it is i agree very well and it's  all about lebron james in cleveland yeah it is it's unbelievable i know it's great we got a chance  to talk to him when he was still in high school you know going to watch him play a couple of games  and just like the coolest guy you know he really really respectful and and down to earth and i would  hope so he was 25 in high school yeah see that's yeah i got a kind of a car crash that kind of did 
[01:33:00]  bombsite that's all right i was trying to help i know you did i tried to give you an assist or  something i don't know i pothin you uh yeah all right kim hey guys again we're so thrilled to have  you guys back welcome back and uh let's try you know you are you are really going to just make  enemies out of everybody that is trying to do us right you can't continue to just hang up on 
[01:33:30]  but it's so much of the people that are important to this program right now more affiliates you want  to humiliate it is really funny for some reason i don't know why hanging up on someone in mid  sentence is hysterical because it's almost like if you had a gun and you could kill them it would  be just as funny hey i just wanted to watch them just lay there well because you know she continues  talking and realizes we hung up yeah then has to awkwardly walk down the hall and everyone heard it 
[01:34:00]  on the air and wonder how long she was talking after the hang-up i bet you got disconnected and then  yeah she hears us on delay and no i didn't they're laughing oh is that awful this guy won't stop  calling it says uh just wants to say welcome back ron in brooklyn what's up welcome home uh thank you  ron that's all you wanted to say well just to say welcome home it's a good thing you're back i'm  taping your show now even as we speak and i think we're gonna get the only army back to gear  uh it's now called the o and a pests well that's two out of three they're pests they're they're 
[01:34:30]  truly pests yeah by the way happy birthday yesterday anthony thank you sir i don't think anthony did  anything for his birthday i'm gonna try to hook up something one of these days i hope it will be  yeah i know everybody's back to normal i kept in touch with one of our regulars stalker patty a long time  ago and what happened well you know kevin search um he sees me more so often and says to say hi to  her i'll email her and i'd like to know what language he's speaking by the way i'd like to understand 
[01:35:00]  you you you're speaking and i think it's english but i can't understand it's like charlie brown's  teacher wah wah wah wah wah listen if it's the cold i had anyway all right thank you ron we're glad to be  back thank you very much even though we uh we've been back for about 18 months yeah thanks for being a  cheap uh cheapo oh please i'll keep in touch with you guys there's the cheapos and then the people  that were paying that are mad that they were paying yeah let's go to cigars and scotch a faithful  listener of this fine program cigars and scotch what's up congratulations on the deal and i love 
[01:35:30]  anthony's new jack klugman impression thank you i'm doing a stage version of the odd couple yeah for the  people that haven't heard us in a while uh anthony's really really suffering yeah i have a uh bad cold i  don't normally sound like this please of course i don't think that needs to be explained yeah you've  referenced a dunk tank yeah now those of us that have xm are laughing our butts off right keeping it  clean but there's so many people that do not know the origins of jay moore's brilliant line and i think 
[01:36:00]  this should be explained it really is something that jay moore came up with and we have definitely  adopted uh crossed away from us is where robin used to do the news for howard's show  and uh jay moore called it a dunk booth yeah and it's very very accurate it's the dunk tank it's the  dunk tank and now it's just been overtaken by degenerates yeah they're just uh destroying the thing  but uh tomorrow big a and twitchels will be doing the news from the dunk tank yeah and then i think 
[01:36:30]  know what we should do we should just have uh a listener every day come up from the street and do  the news from the dunk tank yeah put them in there like the old days in here yeah just start uh giving  tours and stuff see how useless she was we should drag travis out of here street can do it  travis hasn't said anything to the audience young travis good guys got nothing all right thanks cigars  and scotch all right let's have the body like a toothpick by the way when we end in about 45 minutes 
[01:37:00]  uh and then continue our show on xm satellite radio uh we got four bag pipers that will be  helping us with the walk today are we are we just doing this to be wacky we're openly admitting that  it's really hack it is stupid we know that i wanted a marching band bag pipes are gonna look silly  we're looking for a high school marching band you want some uh publicity for your freaking band  you know get a hold of ben ben what's your email address these days 
[01:37:30]  ben at foundrymusic.com yeah it's on the website all right i've never seen ben work this hard  though in quite some time ben actually has to work now he actually ran and after four  feet just grabbed his chest and collapsed  it's fun yeah yeah ben is really enjoying himself so far i like it i like being you know  ben used to just have to sit in front of the computer and he'd punch up websites and with his 
[01:38:00]  his uh little mouse he would highlight text and then unhighlight it at a terrific rate of speed  and that's what he would do and we would joke that that was his job i know travis goes to me  yesterday he goes you're gonna be that hands-on every day now is yeah you know it's what he used  to do though at any w for us syncing up everybody it's kind of in charge i think the name of the  job is producer ben remember they have to work again you know i haven't worked since any w you know 
[01:38:30]  at least he's admitting it thank god he faked it for 18 months over there he seems to be a new ben i gotta  admit yeah he's very excited about this full of vim and vigor okay we're gonna take a break you're  listening to the opian anthony program and uh when we get back you want to try to do the tyra  banks thing actually try to do something today the most self-important woman in the world by the  way to the new listeners eventually we'll do stuff with this radio program don't you worry we're just  kind of getting comfortable it's like a it's like a homecoming where we're talking to the old 
[01:39:00]  listeners they're welcoming us back we're yeah we're kind of introducing everybody to the cast of  characters telling some old stories you know that type of thing but eventually we'll actually talk  about uh you know the news and the pop culture and things that matter yeah things that matter we got  things i see a bunch of there's a million things in front of you but we'll never get to them or we  got a gigantic breast story that we might get to well from uh the insider and we also have that  dateline thing which is now just should become a reality tv show do we have that audio just spin it

[01:43:30]  Como.  All right, we're back.  We're checking out the instant feedback from Free FM.  Jimmy's a little annoyed.  Some of it's bad.  Some of it's good.  It's just funny to read some of these disgruntled people.  This one retard, Jimmy and Queens.  What's all the hype about?  You guys are the worst.  There is nothing to your show.  Oh, Davis Lee Roth was better.  Davis Lee Roth. 
[01:44:00]  Was he really?  I enjoyed Davis Lee Roth.  Oh, I love the people that make their opinions after a couple of shows.  Mark my words.  And this guy, I don't believe.  You will love us.  Joe from Brooklyn is not a disgruntled Howard Fenn in disguise.  This is worse than Roth.  Who they should have stuck with a bit longer.  Serious?  Here I come.  Running to the store right now.  You better do something to CVS.  You just lost a valuable customer. 
[01:44:30]  Who cares, stupid?  You're one guy.  You don't mean anything.  Let's say hi to Heather in New Jersey.  Heather, what's up today?  Hey, guys.  I want to say I really appreciate what you're doing.  I don't know.  True Radio is dying out.  I'm a new fan, and you guys are really holding your own.  Heather.  You're a new fan today?  I am.  I am.  I'm at work right now, and I have you guys on.  Thank you, Heather.  And can I read this guy's name?  Because he put it in the instant feedback.  You can, right? 
[01:45:00]  But we're talking to Heather.  I'm sorry.  Heather is kissing our butt.  Heather, are you still here?  Yeah, I'm here.  I just can't make out what you're saying.  Oh.  Let's get a little background on Heather quickly.  Heather, how old are you?  Nineteen.  She's nineteen.  Isn't that wonderful?  Teen.  Remember.  And what made you laugh today?  What's that?  What made you laugh today?  Laugh?  Laugh?  What the hell is that?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  No, it made me laugh.  I don't know you guys.  I don't know.  Just the whole...  Oh, boy. 
[01:45:30]  Just the whole, you know, devil-may-care attitude.  I dig it.  Yeah, she likes the attitude of the show.  She has a pretty rad.  We did not just use the word rad.  Why?  Hopefully she's nineteen.  She could use whatever word she wants.  I don't think you forgot how it is to be nineteen, guys.  I don't think they're using rad these days as much.  You made a comeback.  No, you forget that when you're nineteen, you can use an abused word.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  All right, Heather.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  The reality is we're just trying to get comfortable.  Of course we are.  And then we'll really get going in the next day or two. 
[01:46:00]  Yes, Jimmy?  Dave Herleman from New York.  That's the name he gave us.  Comment.  I tuned into ONA.  This is to CBS, by the way.  I tuned into ONA and found it very disturbing.  Pretending to break a woman's glasses and making her cry is not very nice and kid-like.  Is this the new format?  I will not be tuning in.  Those are still the same people that endorse sex in church.  I'm telling everyone to not follow the station and your morals.  You have none.  First of all, you lying scumbag. 
[01:46:30]  That glasses-breaking thing was done on XM, so get your filthy lies straight.  Really?  Yeah, after we leave here, we continue on XM, and we had Stalker Patty come in, and I broke  her glasses, so she thought.  Yeah.  Got her in tears.  Then we threw a sheet cake at her that was brought in for Anthony's birthday.  Yes.  That ended up on her back, and she was dressed for her new job at Starbucks. 
[01:47:00]  So she started crying.  I have to go to work.  I can't go with cake on me.  And then she found out that we didn't actually break her glasses, and she was very, very relieved.  And then at that point, we couldn't be the nice guys that we sometimes are, and just hand  back the glasses to her.  We gave her a deal or no deal.  And she had to choose between walking around the studio amongst mousetraps and rat traps. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, big rat traps with the glasses.  We were going to put her glasses on the floor and spread rat traps all over the floor.  And mousetraps.  And she would be blindfolded and have to find her glasses through the mouse and rat traps,  which is really funny.  We did that to her once, made her completely strip naked and crawl around on the floor.  And the snapping and screaming was hysterical.  And we were going to do that yesterday, but we gave her an option. 
[01:48:00]  She could do that.  Or she could put a rubber doctor's glove on, a latex doctor's glove, and grab a certain  part of Jimmy's anatomy and hold it for, how long was it?  30 seconds.  30 seconds.  And she's a virgin, by the way.  She's never been with a guy.  Never even heavy petting.  Just nothing.  So this was a little shocking for her.  But she opted for that one. 
[01:48:30]  She opted for the grab Jimmy.  And she was horrified, as was everybody in the studio.  But that all went on after this.  Yeah, so that guy's a liar, liar, pants on time.  And by the way, you know, don't worry.  We're going to bring all this fine stuff to this program, too.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  We're really just getting comfortable.  We would like to actually do a broadcast in a studio that's complete.  I just got to read one more.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  He's gritting his teeth.  It's just, I just hate people's guts. 
[01:49:00]  I see his Breathe Right strip switching.  I knew it was inevitable.  David Lee Roth would be bagged.  Really?  How'd you know that?  Do you work for Arbitron?  He was simply too good and apparently too sophisticated.  Finally, there was articulate talk and fresh format, which you apparently couldn't help but squash.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Too bad.  He wrote too bad again.  Now you turn to O&A. 
[01:49:30]  Personalities that cater to white trash entertainment.  Fact.  Thank you.  Very true.  For getting our listeners right.  Doesn't CBS radio management realize that this is New York?  Question mark.  Exclamation point.  Question mark.  I think they realize what state they're in.  And then in parentheses, I realize the broadcast extends well beyond New York City, but oh well.  Back to searching for sharp, stimulating morning radio content.  What a bore this ass must be driving around in his car.  Where are you turning to in your sob? 
[01:50:00]  Please tell me exactly what station you're going to for your stimulating morning content.  It would be this station.  Can't seem to find anything stimulating.  I want to interrupt this program.  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  Who saw this coming?  Let's say hi to Dennis in New Jersey.  Dennis, what's going on?  How's it going, guys?  Welcome back.  Thanks, Dennis.  Me and my mom were at a drive-thru at Wendy's in Jersey, and we saw this little midget wearing a little child-sized Wendy's uniform. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, it gets better.  Okay.  He had this tiny little walker.  He needed a walker?  Crippled midget.  A poor little crippled midget?  Yeah.  And he was in a little, and I mean L-I-apostrophe-L, a little uniform?  He certainly was. 
[01:51:00]  And what was he doing at Wendy's?  Apparently going to work.  What was the, oh, you didn't see him at Wendy's?  You saw him going to?  He was getting out of his car.  I didn't know what the job was.  Yeah.  Poor guy.  Well, usually these sightings are very, very entertaining.  I like when the sightings are better, because usually it has a little story, like I was shopping, went to the supermarket, and I saw a cart that didn't seem to have anyone really pushing it.  And then I realized there was a little midget pushing it with his little sausage, Vienna sausage fingers. 
[01:51:30]  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Hey, Freddie, what's going on, man?  Hey, how you doing?  Listen, I just had what you guys did to stalk a body.  Yeah.  With the glue chops and everything.  Yeah.  Well, I'm an exterminator, so I'm volunteering my services.  Yeah.  And just to let you know, now that I can get a double shot of you guys, man, this weekend I'm getting an XM.  Ah, very good.  Look, see, the deal works for everybody.  Exactly.  See, that's... 
[01:52:00]  You've got to get, if anybody's upset over David Lee, let's be fired.  Why don't you just have him on as a guest and make him happy?  Yeah, we could have David Lee Roth on.  Yeah, why not?  I don't think we'll be young.  Yeah, that'll work.  I'm happy.  He's rich anyway, so it doesn't matter if he can fire anyway.  Right on.  All right, thank you, Freddie.  Look, whether you liked him or hated him or whatever, you know, he seemed like a nice enough guy, but the numbers just were plummeting.  Well, the ratings came out today.  That's just a fact of the matter.  You could write about how great it was and how you enjoyed his stimulating conversation and everything. 
[01:52:30]  That's all fine and well, but the ratings were in a free fall.  They had to do something.  You know, this is radio.  That's what happens.  If we don't bring the numbers up, your pals O&A are going to be on the front page of the papers again.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  You know, it's just the way the business works.  Wouldn't it be funny if they were just dissatisfied and fired the show tomorrow?  Hysterical funny.  Well, you know, maybe funny, not the right word. 
[01:53:00]  There'd be no surprise.  Keith in Jersey, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, Keith.  Hey, man.  You guys were just talking about the perverted justice bloopers.  Yeah.  There was this one episode where this guy walks in the house completely naked.  Yes, we saw that.  Yeah.  Yeah, he walks completely naked, and then two hours later, he gets caught at McDonald's on the same exact day.  Yeah, that was an all-one.  It was the next day, actually.  It wasn't two hours later, but it was the same guy.  I thought it was the same day.  No, but either way, that doesn't make it much better, but he was using the same screen name.  You've got to love this guy. 
[01:53:30]  By the way, I guess America's Most Wanted is doing the same thing.  They're ripping them off.  They're doing the same exact bit.  Yeah, that dateline's doing.  Really?  Yeah, just thought I'd throw that in.  Good.  Had nothing useful to add to the conversation.  It's getting just crazy ratings, so of course.  True.  Of course they're going to do the exact same thing.  Is that the guy?  Is that the actual clip?  When the cops came to get him.  This is what he said.  I just came to get something to eat. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, that was his excuse.  I just came to get something to eat.  Yes, but it's what you wanted to eat that the problem is.  All right, let's get into this Tyra Banks thing.  Where's Nathaniel?  Nathaniel's one of our guys.  His whole job with the show is pretty much to watch TV.  That's his job.  Actually, he does a lot more for the show, but one of his main jobs is to watch TV and just find that ridiculous stuff that is on TV.  And have commercial auditions ruined by us. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, that's true.  That's his second job.  Yeah, we'll explain that one further down the road.  But basically, he watches TV and brings some of the ridiculous things to our attention.  And one of the shows we can't get enough of is the Tyra Banks show.  I think Tyra Banks can't get enough of that show either.  She is the most self-centered person on television.  Sorry, I'm still trying to figure out what mic to turn off for Nathaniel.  No problem.  I didn't really have anything. 
[01:55:00]  So, the Tyra Banks show, life-saving show, what's that one about?  Yeah, she picked just four or five random things that can happen to a human being and taught her audience how to handle them.  She had, you remember that?  She's helping.  Yeah.  Do you remember the plus-size model Takara from her show?  She had her, it was kind of mean.  She's like, well, we're going to have you get attacked going to an ATM.  And they had all these lights set up and whatnot.  And then, instead, they took her there, and then on the way back, after the rehearsal, they attacked her in a garage without telling her. 
[01:55:30]  So, she just wants to traumatize everybody.  The funny thing is, they did that with a buffet with the fat model.  They said, you're going to be attacked.  Just be prepared.  And what were some of the other ones?  What to do in case you're attacked by a shark.  At the ATM?  Yes.  Kind of odd.  She has a problem with ocean-going life. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Because, of course, we remember the last thing Tyra did to help people was get over their fears.  That's what she does.  If you have a fear of styrofoam, she'll throw you in a pit of styrofoam.  Dr. Tyra knows how to cure people of their phobias.  Well, there was a lady that was scared of the stove.  The stove, yeah.  That was my favorite.  So, Tyra made her baked cookies.  Baked cookies.  And then she puts little prizes in things that they're afraid of.  Like the styrofoam woman, she had to dig through a bunch of styrofoam to get like this diamond ring or some crap. 
[01:56:30]  And then we found out, of course, we have to find out about Tyra, that she, her fear is dolphins.  She's afraid of dolphins.  And we just found that a little odd that, you know, you could pretty much go, you could be afraid of a lot of things.  But if you're afraid of dolphins, you could pretty much 100% guarantee you will not run into one if you do one thing.  Stay away from the water. 
[01:57:00]  If you're in Iowa, you're pretty much safe from dolphins.  Yeah.  So, I mean, on yesterday's show, it was life-saving things.  And I guess she locked herself in a trunk of a car or something.  Is that the one we're going to hear right now?  I think that's the first one.  Okay.  This is on her.  This isn't even in a scary garage or anything.  This is just on stage.  She's brought a car out.  They pulled a car onto her set.  Yeah.  And locked her in the trunk.  You know, if someone attacks you and they're trying to put you in a trunk, you shouldn't do it because your chances of survival go down. 
[01:57:30]  How much?  Well, I think it's something like 90% of the women that are put in a trunk in an attack situation don't come out of it.  Don't come out alive.  I mean, it could say more about the people who put you in a trunk.  Jimmy?  Where do you get that stat from?  Do you talk to people and go, what happened?  Well, then he locked my head off.  All right.  Thank you for taking our survey.  All right.  Another percent.  What a ghoulish, a ghoulish stat that is to have at hand. 
[01:58:00]  They should have ended the segment by pulling her out of the trunk and treating her like Marvin Nash from Reservoir Thoughts.  About the odds.  But there are things you can do to get out of a trunk.  To get out of a trunk.  I know we have a car here.  Yeah.  And I'm going to volunteer.  And I'm going to get in the trunk.  Yes.  Yeah, Tyra.  What courage she has.  She's so brave.  No wonder they put these people in trunks.  Walla doodle.  Walla doodle. 
[01:58:30]  Walla doodle.  Walla doodle.  Walla doodle.  Walla doodle.  See, the impressions are slowly but surely coming about.  I had to do that one to save our job.  All right.  Here we go.  Appropriate.  Here's the second clip.  If you are forced into a trunk, there are a couple of things you want to do.  First of all, you want to look, search around under the fabric.  This usually would be enclosed in a normal trunk.  So you have to pull the fabric off of this?  Pull the fabric off or the plastic off and you'll find a trunk cable in most cars.  Okay.  And just pulling on that real hard will actually release the trunk. 
[01:59:00]  So this is the thing I'm supposed to pull.  Can we see this?  I think everybody should see this at home.  This will be under some fabric or some plastic, but this is what you're supposed to pull.  That's right.  The newer cars actually have an orange cable you can pull on.  Oh, a real orange cable situation.  New cars.  New cars.  Okay.  But not everybody has new cars.  No.  Especially not serial killers.  Yeah.  If you're a serial killer.  See an old key type lock on their trunk.  Well, if you're going to lock someone in your trunk, wouldn't you make sure they're not  going to be able to get out?  Yeah.  Tie them up.  Knock them out.  Something.  Disable that gadget. 
[01:59:30]  By the way, if you pull on that, you'll get out.  I'm going to be stopping up the road a little way.  I do believe the serial killers also know that, Tyra.  This is a little trunk.  So I'm going to get into it.  You're my attacker, right?  You're making me get in here.  You should do.  Yeah.  I guess I wouldn't help you into the trunk.  No, you wouldn't.  I'm 5'10".  Yeah.  All right.  So I'm getting inside the trunk.  All right.  Watch your head there.  Slam her head. 
[02:00:00]  Put your shoulder there a little tight.  Okay.  All right.  So now she's locked in the trunk.  And they got a camera in the trunk just staring at her stupid face.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  It's really small in here.  It's a trunk in here.  Get me a camera here!  Help!  Help!  Help!  What is she doing?  Okay.  Now he has walked away.  I thought that was the audience.  He's gone.  And I feel safe enough to get out. 
[02:00:30]  Where is the...  I don't even see it.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, yes.  Nice to be here.  She did it.  Beautiful.  They should have disabled it and driven it to Texas and left her out in the sun for a week.  Why are they clapping because she popped the trunk latch?  Why don't you do the old minivan test and have Susan Smith back you up to a dock?  See how well you do there.  Right. 
[02:01:00]  If you're so confident, let's make it a little more difficult.  Yeah.  But it was all lit up, the trunk and everything.  Of course.  So it was so easy to find the stupid cable.  The guy tells her where it is.  And they applaud like idiots on these shows.  All right.  So what if you're locked in a room?  I mean, I watch 24.  Yeah, exactly.  And I always wonder if I was Jack Bauer's daughter because she just keeps getting kidnapped over and over again.  What would I do?  You know what she does, like every five minutes.  So what do we do?  This is my door over here.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  If you're locked in...  If you're locked in, you don't want to do what you see in the cop shows where they run for it.  They do this.  Yeah, exactly.  They do the shoulder.  Don't you see that?  It's like...  Yeah.  It's a perfect way to dislocate your shoulder.  Really?  But what you actually want to do is focus on the lock area or the handle area.  Kicking a door open.  And give it one or two, usually is enough, one or two strong kicks right above or around the lock area.  Really?  Do you want me to show you this?  Oh, yeah.  I'll see if I can do this here.  All right.  Oh, okay.  More applause. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  This is obviously a little easier than your average door, but...  But that's how you do it.  To kick through the lock.  All right.  I'm going to try it.  Let me give it a shot.  I'm Jack Bowers' daughter.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it's really...  It's very odd to hear someone that hot and want them to be paralyzed.  It is just nonsense TV every single day. 
[02:02:30]  She is awful.  Every single day, nonsense TV with Tyra Banks.  She's helping.  Helping who?  You wouldn't know.  The attackers don't know what to do.  Yeah, cut that cable.  Good point.  Imagine that.  You're stuck in a trunk.  Someone locks you in.  You go, you know, thank God I saw that ridiculous episode of Tyra.  Let me just pull this up and...  Oh, geez.  The cable's gone.  I think you remember your attacker had on a Tyra shirt.  Oh, no.  Vinny from New Jersey. 
[02:03:00]  What's going on, buddy?  Oh, hey, and Jim, it is so good to have you guys back.  Thanks, Vinny.  Thanks.  Listen, with this Tyra Banks stuff, they got to lock her in the trunk, drive it down to SeaWorld in Florida, right into the dolphin tank.  So when she does escape, she's stuck in a tank full of dolphins.  And let her try to get out of that one.  Surprise.  All right, Vinny, thank you.  All right, thanks.  Take care.  All right, let's say hi to Frank.  Frank, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys.  Congratulations.  Man, I'm an XM guy. 
[02:03:30]  I saw Norton on the last comic stand-in a couple years ago.  He was wearing the XM 0-8 t-shirt.  That's the first that I had heard about it.  And I got hooked up with the satellite.  I never looked back.  I mean, I'm happy for you guys.  I hope you're getting paid tons of money.  Me too.  I don't know what I'm making yet.  But to be honest with you, I'm done with FM radio.  But everybody out there that's listening on FM radio, you're very fortunate to be hearing this show.  This is the most honest, real, funniest show in the country.  This show is it. 
[02:04:00]  And we'll get to that soon.  Maybe not this morning, but I'm telling you, this is the show.  Yeah, Frank, we're not going to make believe we're really uncomfortable because we're just getting used to doing this again.  The two shows right now are drastically different.  We leave here in a few minutes.  We go over to XM.  And we've been there for 18 months.  We know the studio.  We know our listeners, all that stuff.  And it's very, very comfortable.  We're going to get to that point very, very soon over here as well.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  The show is wherever you do the show. 
[02:04:30]  It's all.  It's great.  I got to tell you, it feels a lot better today than it did yesterday already.  That's what happens.  I think we'll be up to speed by Monday.  Oh, yeah.  But I urge everybody.  I mean, I don't.  And I know.  I hope you suck these guys dry for money.  But everybody's got to get satellite radio.  All right.  When I first got that satellite.  All right.  Let me just finish.  When I first got that, it was like the first time I got it and I started listening to it.  Now I know what people must have felt like when they first started getting TVs back in the old days.  Satellite radio is very special. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Thank you.  Tom, just not just going to be.  Yeah, I know.  But do you want us to get sued?  Yeah, really?  Let's say hi to Kevin in New Jersey.  Kevin, what's up?  Yo, yo.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  All right.  A couple questions for you.  First off, what's going on with Bubba?  He's in New York this week.  I heard you guys have some people.  I want to know what the fight's planned for.  What's he doing in New York besides an obviously major event?  He's here for the Outdoor Film Festival.  Of course he is.  Well, he had his chance to beat me up and, you know, he didn't show up. 
[02:05:30]  So what can I tell you?  Oh, come on.  Go to the serious place.  You can knock him out, right?  He had his chance.  Let's say hi to Rocco, one of the Hell's Angels that listens to this program.  Rocco, what's up?  What's going on, ONA?  Welcome back to Radio Airways, brother.  We missed you guys.  Thank God somebody finally realized to put you back on.  Thank you, Rocco, sir.  Hey, listen.  If you guys have any problem up there, you just let us know and you will be escorted to  wherever you have to go in style.  That's fine.  Thank you, Rocco. 
[02:06:00]  We appreciate and respect the offer, but I do believe we have our own security, people.  Not that we wouldn't love to have you.  I wouldn't mind having the Hell's Angels on our side.  It didn't work too well for the Rolling Stones, but I think why not give them a second chance,  Anthony?  We got a second chance.  Why not give the Hell's Angels a second chance?  I say we hire them as our security starting tomorrow.  Hey, Anthony, you got to do me one favor. 
[02:06:30]  We were listening to when you were back on and you were doing your mother-in-law driving  in the car.  Yeah.  Can you just do that one more time?  I will get into all those fun stories when I can actually talk.  I would do it if I was you.  It's a Hell's Angel.  Remember.  Thank you.  Oh, look.  You're saved by the bagpipes.  Thank you, Rocco.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bagpipes.  Jesus. 
[02:07:00]  We stink.  This is going to be our escort.  Yeah, who else is getting a douche chill?  Down the street.  We are hacks.  Well, we got like three and a half minutes left here, and then the show continues on XM  satellite radio, and people are starting to figure out every day we're going to make the  walk from here to there.  And today, the bagpipers will be escorting us to XM satellite radio. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  And these guys, where are you from and all that?  Let's get a few plugs in for you guys.  Yeah, how are you doing?  Welcome back, guys.  Thanks for having us.  We're the Monaghan Pipe Band.  We're the number one pipe band in New York City.  We're the oldest pipe, one of the oldest pipe bands in the country.  How do you know you're the number one pipe band in New York City?  Can anyone here say otherwise?  We might have a battle of the pipe band.  Well, actually, we do have them.  They have pipe band contacts.  Oh, they do?  There's different grades. 
[02:08:00]  We're a grade two pipe band.  It's the highest grade in New York.  Nice.  And actually, we're the only grade two pipe band in New York.  Therefore, we're the best pipe band in New York.  Now, you're the drummer, I see.  I'm the bass drummer.  Can you also pipe?  I could, but...  You're not the good...  Yeah.  I'm a man.  You're like the guy...  Oh, wow.  He's kissing his pipers.  Yeah.  What we're going to do is we're going to march out of here.  You guys are going to walk us down the street, and we'll bring you right back up to the studios  at XM and have a little fun, okay?  That's great.  It's an honor.  Thanks so much, guys. 
[02:08:30]  Welcome back again.  Thank you.  What kind of plug do you guys need?  What kind of plug do we need?  Yeah, man.  You should get something out of it.  The name, again, is...  We're the Monaghan Pipe Band, monaghanpb.com.  We're growing and growing.  We practice in the Bronx every Monday, and we have a lower grade band, a grade four band.  No one knows how to spell Monaghan, by the way.  Monaghan.  There's many ways to spell Monaghan.  M-O-N-A-G-H-A-N.  P-B.com.  That's the Monaghan.  I'm not going to happen.  It's Monaghan.  And we're having a band dance in Brooklyn this Saturday night. 
[02:09:00]  Believe it or not, Unlimited Beer.  And the wonderful and sweet tunes of the Monaghan and the Martin Duffin Memorial Pipe Band.  And so...  How do you dance to that?  What's that?  How do you dance to pipes?  Is it that river dancing?  Just like that.  Yeah.  And try to hold on.  And what's the phone number if people want to book you?  They can call me at 516-457-9797.  That number again is 516-457-9797.  Operators are standing by.  All right.  Get near the door. 
[02:09:30]  Start warming up.  Thanks, man.  We've got like a minute and a half left of this portion of the show, and we'll start marching.  All right?  Let's go to the phones for the last minute here.  Jimmy in New York City.  What's up?  Yo, man.  What's going on?  Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say congratulations.  You guys are doing a fantastic job.  David Weiroth, I don't know what they were thinking.  They should have realized that that was a bad choice since you got a hold of Van Halen  and turned him into a puss.  I mean, Van Hagar.  You know what?  It sounded good on paper.  They gave it a shot, and that's okay.  And now we're here, and we're going to make it work. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  You guys.  I listen to you guys on the way to school every morning.  You guys make my day, really.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Charles in Massachusetts.  Charles, what's up?  Welcome back, man.  I miss you guys because I'm a cheapskater and didn't want to buy XM radio.  We missed you, Charles.  Thanks, Charles.  No, because I remember your previous two tours of duty up here in Massachusetts.  Yeah.  I was hysterical, so I was kind of heartbroken when you went to XM.  All right.  Well, we're going to be around for a while this time.  Glad to hear you.  Uh-oh.  They're starting up. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, no.  Thank you, Charles.  Georgia, Long Island.  What's up, George?  Hi, George.  George, you got to yell.  You got to yell.  Tune in tomorrow for Funny Shirt Friday.  Hey, tomorrow on the program, Big A and Twitchell's doing the news from the dunk booth.  Also, they're going to do Yo Mama.  We got Joe Rogan and Bill Burr.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. 
[02:11:00]  And we'll see you at XM in a few minutes.  We're out of here with the bagpipe.  Thanks for listening.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Is this mic on?  Yes.  I can't even tell.  Yes.  We have left.  Free FM.  We're in the lobby.  We're heading to the sidewalk. 
[02:11:30]  This is really embarrassing.  The bagpipes are in front of us.  We're openly admitting that this is really hack radio.  That is the worst.  That a morning zoo should do.  But the looks we're getting are priceless.  It was funny when they walked in and Opie said, is anybody else getting the douche chill?  The douche chill.  They make me want to drink.  Look at all the people on the sidewalk just running away.  They don't understand why during rush hour bagpipers are playing marching down the street. 
[02:12:00]  Got a few listeners out here today.  Not as many as yesterday.  It's the walk up 57th street to the XM Satellite Radio studios.  I thought today's show was a little better than yesterday, huh?  Yeah, I think it gets better every day.  We should spend this time just, you know, talking about the show we did so we could get better.  A recap?  A little recap of the show.  I can't wait to feel better.  That'll help me out a lot more.  Yeah, that's what time.  It's like you've been in 30 years. 
[02:12:30]  That's good for radio and visual.  Look at all these people with their iPods just totally annoyed.  Oh, look at Travis.  Hey, Travis.  Good to see you.  Only in Manhattan can you do this without getting a severe reaction.  Yeah, people are kind of looking through the band.  They're kind of looking, but, you know, they're still on their way.  No one stops.  No one.  This city is ridiculous.  We're stuck at the light.  This is terrific. 
[02:13:00]  Do you know how stupid we look?  That's the whole point.  This stuff is great on paper, and then when you're actually being stared at like a jizz bucket,  you're like, maybe we shouldn't have done this.  It's just a hack.  Uh-oh.  But they ran out of songs?  Did they run out of songs already?  You guys run out of songs?  They're probably hyperventilated.  We're about to cross over 6th Avenue on our way back to XM.  We like attention.  Get out of the way.  Or.  All right, let's continue with our walk.  There we go.  Now we're walking again. 
[02:13:30]  Across 6th Avenue.  The bagpipers in front of us.  Just a bunch of fools.  The Monaghan pipe van from New York City.  It's like it's gearing up to be a beautiful day here in New York.  We're passing a newsstand.  Jimmy, you need any more magazines or anything for the second half of the show?  Yeah.  Some people have lined up like it's a parade.  They've actually started to split up on the sides of the sidewalk, thinking it's some kind of parade.  Hi, sir.  Do you sell any men's magazines like Playgirl? 
[02:14:00]  We do.  All right.  How much for a magazine with cocks in it?  That's like $8, $9, different fries.  All right.  Let's get one of those.  The darker, the better.  Take this anyone.  Oh, let's take a look, Jimmy.  There's Man Date.  He likes Big Fat Cock.  Yeah.  What's the best magazine with Big Fat Cock in it?  Yeah, which is your top seller?  Honcho is the best one.  Where's Honcho for Pete's sake?  Yes, it's over there.  That's right.  Honcho.  100% stud meat. 
[02:14:30]  Real men, real naked.  How much for a honcho, fella?  Hey, where do the bagpipes go, by the way?  Hold on.  This is embarrassing without the bagpipes.  Hi, sir.  Great.  All right.  Can I buy this?  Oh, sure.  He's going to get that.  A bunch of men.  Just look at other men.  What about...  Now, this is all I need, sir.  Don't try to force cock down my throat.  All right.  Thanks, fella.  Godspeed.  I think you should have went for all boys, Jimmy, myself.  No, honcho is the way to go.  Yeah, we all know that.  Jimmy actually bought honcho.  Why wouldn't I?  Let's look at it as we're walking down the street. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  Get that band play.  Otherwise, it's still silly.  He's got his copy of honcho.  Who doesn't?  Look at these gentlemen.  Oh, God.  Hello, sir.  How are you?  Honcho Magazine, fella.  Get a shot of that.  I'm a big fan of the Opie and Anthony program in his WOW t-shirt.  We just passed.  A bunch of listeners outside the studio.  We're on the other side of the street here now.  That's right.  By the way, we're passing the studio because we need coffee.  That's right.  We'll see you guys in a few minutes. 
[02:15:30]  We got to get coffee.  We'll be back in two minutes.  Tourists are taking pictures like it's a parade.  You know what it is?  They probably say, wow, look at those guys.  They look like dicks.  And they're correct.  We might as well take advantage of this.  This is like our coffee break.  How else are we going to do five, five and a half hours of radio every day?  Oh, look.  They're waving at us.  Bus load of little kids.  Little kids are waving.  Cover up your honcho magazine.  No.  They're all clapping.  Hello, everybody.  Hey, kid. 
[02:16:00]  You ever see Perverted Justice?  All right.  We got the bagpipes.  It's the Monaghan bagpipes from New York City.  A lot more sidewalk traffic up here, by the way.  Oh, look at this little skinny kofor.  You dropped something.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You got nothing from her.  I didn't even look.  Everyone's on their way to work.  The hustle and bustle.  And now they're enjoying the bagpipe.  By the way, bagpipes, one of the most annoying instruments ever made. 
[02:16:30]  Poe, why do you have your arm out?  Like, there's big trouble coming.  There's 40, 30.  Why does Poe have a suitcase, a rolling suitcase?  What's in that?  I didn't hear you.  Exactly.  Why do you have a suitcase, a rolling suitcase?  Oh, because I have all the stuff that I need to protect you guys.  My paperwork.  I can only imagine.  Why is Don Wicklin giving us two minutes?  What happens in two minutes?  What happens in two minutes?  We've got two minutes to go.  All right.  Let's get in line inside. 
[02:17:00]  What happens in two minutes?  All right.  All right.  We're in Starbucks.  What, this is the line for Starbucks?  No, Ben.  Yeah.  Oh, they've got a big long line in Starbucks.  I'm not a big coffee drinker.  I'll go in, though.  Wow, this is a long line.  Ben is trying to get us to the front of the line.  That ain't going to work.  What are you looking at, lady?  It's going to annoy people.  Jimmy, the lady right there is really, really annoyed. 
[02:17:30]  Who cares?  Oh, look at Kenny.  I'm not cutting this line.  I'm not cutting the line.  This is New York City.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not cutting that line.  I don't cut lines.  I'm not that brave.  Talk to that lady, though.  She's really annoyed.  Wow.  You can go to the front of the line.  Miss, you just cut me.  This lady just cut me.  Well, just have Ben.  I'm feeding honcho.  Ben, just give me a grande cappuccino skim milk dry.  Kenny, order that for me.  Jimmy, he's feeding his honcho, and there's a girl right behind him. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  And he goes, you just cut me in line.  And then she went behind him, and he opened up his honcho to one of the worst pornographic  gay pages I've ever seen.  All right.  I guess we've got to set the scene.  We're showing the honcho.  We're at Starbucks.  Jimmy, are you?  Oh, that's a nice one, right?  They usually don't show Johnny.  No.  No, Johnny doesn't really show.  That's a good one.  He's not known for showing. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're on a very long line at Starbucks.  Should we just wait outside?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to wait outside for our coffee order.  They're so annoyed at us in here.  Oh, they hate us.  It's the Monahan pipe band from New York.  Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or XM-CANADA at 877-438-9677.  The OVM Show. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  Okay.  We're back on.  There we go.  We're back on.  They had to have an ID or something.  All right.  Why don't we work our way across the street?  I don't have my coffee yet.  Yeah.  We're waiting for our coffee.  Oh, are you waiting for your coffee?  Who's getting it?  I am.  Ben is getting the coffee.  Oh, Ben?  So we're just going to stand outside of Starbucks?  Yeah.  That's what we do now.  Jesus Christ.  Here.  Talk to that fan of ours.  What?  What?  The one in the green shirt.  Who's brave enough to approach him? 
[02:19:30]  Hi, sir.  You have anything you want to say?  O-N-A rocks?  You like Honcho?  That would be a no.  You like Honcho Magazine?  Yeah.  You want to?  Honcho.  How old are you?  I am 22.  Glad I met you 10 years ago.  All right.  All right.  What are we going to do as we wait for our coffee?  I don't know.  Just wish that we had another band with us.  This is really embarrassing.  Well, we'll do something different tomorrow.  I think tomorrow we got a guy on a unicycle.  Like a really, really big one or something. 
[02:20:00]  Another annoyed person walking out of Starbucks.  Hi, sir.  Sorry to wreck your morning.  Oh, Ben's got the coffee.  Ben, you got to carry my Honcho.  Yeah, Ben.  Carry my Honcho, faggot.  Onward.  Thanks.  And back we go.  Come on, guys.  Working our way to the studio.  That's right.  I'm going to cross the street now.  Oh, boy.  Oh, please let the marching band cross in the middle of the street.  I want Poe to stop traffic.  I want to see how good Poe is. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  I think Poe and Kenny should stop traffic for us.  And the band.  Well, Kenny's not messing around.  Wow.  He just stopped traffic on 57th Street during rush hour.  Kenny's good.  That's very impressive, Kenny.  That's right.  Kenny's got no fear.  He's stuck right in front of a vehicle doing about 50.  And our intern's about to trip over a curb.  All right.  We're finally on the other side of the sidewalk, making our way to XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:21:00]  We've got our coffee in hand.  Looking like complete asses.  You just can't make eye contact with anyone.  That was really awful.  I want the bagpipers in the elevator with us.  No.  Yes.  Do they have to even come in?  Geez.  All right.  We're about 100 yards away.  People are going to start to look at us.  You think?  Making a spectacle.  Yes.  Good morning, everybody. 
[02:21:30]  Good morning.  Is the guy videotaping us?  Kenny.  For what?  See why that guy's videotaping us right now.  Why is he?  What?  This guy's videotaping us.  Ask him what he's using the tape for.  He's probably a foreigner.  Oh, he's a foreigner?  Yeah.  All right.  Wow, we must have tens of listeners waiting for us outside XM Satellite Radio.  Can't they just build a tunnel for us so we don't have to deal with anybody? 
[02:22:00]  Look, they're pointing and smiling.  Oh, you should see these creepy miscreants.  All right, we're heading in to continue the Opie and Anthony program.  Excuse me, ladies.  Big stars coming through.  How many minutes did this kill, by the way?  Four at least.  All right, we're in the lobby of XM Satellite Radio.  Nice magazine, Ben.  Oh, are they going to be annoyed when they hear this band following us in?  Oh, man.  Oh, boy, are they annoyed.  The building guy is not happy.  Is he ever?  All right, we shut him down.  We shut him down. 
[02:22:30]  We shut him down.  It's okay.  It's all right.  That's all right.  Everybody calm down.  Calm down now.  I wish he was dead.  Everyone calm down.  All right, we're at the elevators.  We're going to lose the mic, so why don't we just stop right here?  How's that sound?  That's fine with me.  We'll be back on the air in less than a minute.  Maybe two minutes.  I don't know.  Take two elevators up.  All right.  Here.  What the fuck am I?  What the fuck is this kid?  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids. 
[02:23:00]  Pornography in the workplace.  People wait on TV screens.  The drawings.  They ran south and took off with a family car.  People make nasty comments about women.  Viruses.  Writing in our area, find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button!  I'm a black ninja, fuck baby.  All right, we remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dogg on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  Just give me some action today.  I'm going to crap myself. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, what a log you're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  And the Opie.  With Opie.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Good old Ben.  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating boob.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock. 
[02:24:00]  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawk fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:24:30]  Hi.  Hey.  Opie took a great time to take a piss.  It's the now Anthony and Voss show.  That's it.  We lost a couple of guys on our transfer over.  You don't want to make the announcement now?  From Terrestrial Radio.  What's that?  It's just the Anthony and Voss show?  Are we going to wait for the announcement until Monday?  We'll do it.  The announcement will come out right after the cancellation announcement.  Stop it.  No, they had to take a leak, I guess.  Bladders like little hummingbirds, like babies. 
[02:25:00]  They're just peeing straight up in the air, laying on their back.  Can't we call it for us and Anthony?  Why does it got to be Anthony and Voss?  Oh, stop it, Richard.  What happened, Jimmy?  The breeze right strip off and it ripped off another skin.  See, you're going to get a problem with that adhesive on the breeze right strip.  I know.  Do we have any, uh...  Bassett Tracer.  A mirror.  Hello, not good enough to be on regular radio.  How are you?  Bassett, that hurt.  Oh, did you say that to me?  That hurt. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, that's nice.  You know, you are so gloaty.  You are in like a whole lake of untouchable.  You know, this business is like a heart monitor.  It goes up and down.  I understand.  But I never forgot the time that you got recognized at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  And you actually said, well, he's famous, too.  And they go, yeah, who are you?  And I said, Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  They had no clue and then told me to take the picture for them.  Yeah, but here's the thing.  I was always there. 
[02:26:00]  And, uh...  I always introduced you as a famous person.  And it never worked.  No one cared.  Anyway, that was very, very interesting.  Now we're back in familiar surroundings.  Eventually this whole thing is going to make sense for everybody.  Eventually it's going to be comfortable on both ends of this.  But, uh, so far it's, uh, it's a little strange over there.  It's a little strange.  Yeah, it's a little weird, huh?  But, uh, we got some laughs.  We got some laughs in.  I so want it to be like a month down the road, you know? 
[02:26:30]  I want to be used to being over there.  Because now we sit here and it feels like, you know, the show.  Well, right off the bat there's an echo.  So you gotta, like, you gotta...  This is all inside stuff, I guess.  But you have to make sure you don't move while you're broadcasting.  Because as soon as you move off mic, there's this echo that's really, really distracting over there.  But they're going to fix that.  Yeah, they're fixing everything.  I thought it felt a lot better today than it did yesterday.  Just like when we started here every day.  It just gets a little better. 
[02:27:00]  You feel a little better about yourself.  If you recall that first week here, oof.  Oof.  A little nerve-wracked.  And then, uh, you know, unsure surroundings, equipment stuff.  So, just bear with us.  In the end, it's going to be great for everybody.  Uh, we want to thank the, uh, the Monaghan?  Yeah, Monaghan pipe band.  The Monaghan pipe band for giving me a headache.  Five minutes to Monaghan.  Kenny was two feet away from me. 
[02:27:30]  I was trying to tell him something.  He couldn't hear.  That's how loud it was.  Backpipes are real loud.  That was really loud.  And the people at Starbucks.  Because, you know, most of those people are just waking up, just getting their first cup of coffee.  They were so annoyed.  And who knew that the line at Starbucks was that long when regular people are going to work?  When the average Joe is going to work?  It doesn't matter what time of the day.  When we go to Starbucks, it's like six in the morning when, you know, they're just opening.  It's so easy to get your coffee.  The line was all the way out the door.  I think they're doing, uh, pretty good business over there.  Yeah.  I think they're doing all right. 
[02:28:00]  I know it hurts.  The bagpipes, uh, on, like, St. Paddy's Day.  People at nine in the morning or whatever, they don't care.  Because it's St. Paddy's Day.  Nine in the morning on a regular work day, people are just kind of like, what the fuck?  What?  Why?  Why?  Where do you practice that?  Like, at home?  In the Bronx.  In the Bronx.  There you go.  Yeah, can't hear it over the gunfire anyway.  Hold on.  Some people want to comment about the walkover.  Ron in Boston, what's up? 
[02:28:30]  Hey, the walking segment is by far the best segment on the show because it demonstrates  how uncomfortable Anthony is in public.  Doesn't it?  He wants a tunnel built.  It's amazing.  Now we get to finally see the inside.  I didn't go into Starbucks because I hate people.  I love the awkwardness of the whole thing.  I really do.  When people are looking at you like, ugh.  Jimmy's just got a set of nuts on him, though.  He walked right up to that newsstand and asked the guy about magazines with cocks.  He just, and he picked up an issue of, uh, Honcho. 
[02:29:00]  Honcho Magazine.  And then she was showing the pictures to this, uh, this businesswoman at Starbucks.  Yeah, commenting on the fellow on the back.  Well, like Anthony said, uh, uh, she was like, hey, you cut me in line.  And all Jimmy had to show her was the Honcho Magazine and open it up to a horrendous page.  And next thing you know, she had no problem with Jimmy cutting her in line at Starbucks.  All right, Ron.  Thank you.  I got to listen to myself.  Sweet.  All right.  Cool.  Uh, guy with no name from City with no name. 
[02:29:30]  How are you?  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Ant.  Uh, it was yesterday, sir, but thank you.  I know.  Hey, can you break down the, uh, radio magic, the, uh, fourth wall?  Uh, the, what are they, satellite phones, satellite microphones?  How do you guys, you hear, you're perfectly clear as you're walking down the road.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  You can also...  Go ahead.  No, go ahead.  You're doing good.  We just interrupted for one second.  Ah.  What did he do?  I don't know.  XM, uh... 
[02:30:00]  I'm nervous.  XM pulled out their checkbook and, uh, and bought, like, the latest thing.  These things, these microphones are amazing.  Aren't they?  They're handheld microphones.  Eventually, they're going to be pinned on our lapels.  Oh.  And, uh, they broadcast great.  But then again, you know, the studios are only a block away.  They're pretty close.  Thank God.  Let's say hi to, uh, I didn't mean to go to Jen, but Jen, what do you have?  Yeah.  What's up, Jen?  I think that it sucks that I'm paying for XM, and I waited for you guys, you know, to 
[02:30:30]  find out what company you're going to, and now I got, like, twice as many commercials,  and I'm paying for them now, even though you're on free radio.  You're not hearing commercials on XM.  I am.  I'm hearing horse crap on XM.  You guys aren't, like, hanging out and talking and doing your thing.  It's all about...  We are right now.  Well, it's in the early days of this whole thing.  Everyone's got to just relax and see how this plays out.  We got all sorts of ideas.  They're trying to figure out what to do when we go, you know, and play commercials when 
[02:31:00]  we're on regular radio.  There's also talk about taking the whole morning show that we do and making it into a steroid  version, we're calling it, for the replay, so you don't even hear us taking very long  breaks.  So we're still figuring it out as we go.  All right, because it just seems like we're losing more of the show.  Not at all.  We got a new bit where we walk every day, and every day it's going to get sillier and sillier.  That was actually really funny today.  No, that was cool, but I was listening to the replay.  Wait, the only reason that was really funny today...  See, I've got to call some of these people out. 
[02:31:30]  The only reason that was really funny today is because it's a new bit because of the deal  we made.  Yeah.  All right.  And there's so many other things that are going to come about because of the deal we  made.  Better guests, bigger...  I mean, it's, you know...  So just have patience, basically, is what you're saying.  Oh, man, it's only been two days.  We're not even comfortable over there.  I waited two years for you guys to go to XM, and I waited, you know, I saw Jim on Colin's  show and was so psyched, and I don't know.  You know what?  I've got to blow you off, Jen.  That was awesome.  Thanks, Jen.  I've got to blow you off because the guy that was on the phone with us, and he just kind 
[02:32:00]  of hung up out of nowhere, it looks like he hit a bus.  Let's go back to Bill.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, sorry I dumped out of that mic question.  I just hit a goddamn bus.  Fucking wasn't looking and bang, right into the back.  You were walking or driving?  Oh, you're driving.  Driving.  We just hit a fucking city bus.  Oh, no.  You want to talk to the cop?  He's going to be here in a minute.  Yeah, we can do that.  Hold on the line.  How much damage?  All right, man.  How much damage? 
[02:32:30]  My fucking airbag went off, and my front end, I was going 30.  I didn't hear anything.  Yeah, we didn't hear any of that.  My phone went flying out of my hands, and it hit the fucking windshield.  I don't mean to laugh, but my God.  Fuck.  Bill, you all right, though?  I'm fine.  I just fucking pissed.  Hey, where are you?  Where are you?  I'm in downtown Minneapolis, right on the corner of 7th and Hennepin. 
[02:33:00]  Well, there goes traffic in that area.  Fuck.  All right, Bill.  Hold on.  All right.  We'll check in with you in a second here, okay?  I'm paying attention.  Let's go to Mike in New Jersey.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, I think that Jen's chick should shut the fuck up.  You guys need to get midgets circling you as you walk across the street, because the morning  show on CBS, not nearly as bad as we all thought it was going to be.  Well, and we're just getting started.  Me too.  We're just getting started.  You know?  Yeah, well, Jen needs to fucking get AIDS from little Jimmy.  Punching out.  You know, we never pat ourselves on our backs, but we know we're so much better than what's 
[02:33:30]  happening at CBS so far.  We just know that, but it's going to take a little time.  It's going to take a little time.  Yeah, so we should get midgets for the walkover?  Oh, that'd be great.  We want to get the bike taxis.  Yeah, with fat girls.  With fat girls in bikinis.  Pedaling.  In bikinis.  I think tomorrow it's a unicycle.  Just one unicycle?  Like an oversized unicycle.  Well, maybe we could add to it.  We're going to have some kind of circus theme tomorrow.  A juggler? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, we're going to have a little circus theme tomorrow.  Spinning pie plates on sticks?  All that.  All that.  If ever someone could get hit by vehicles tomorrow, make it be circus people.  Somebody on a bike with a cream pie being balanced on a broom handle.  Just a nice truck.  Pie in the face.  I want to have a clown.  And he goes, make up, make up.  And a big powder puff hits him in the face.  LOL.  All right.  I want someone to have a pie and have him go, let me have it. 
[02:34:30]  And then when he says that, a stray bullet hits his spine.  Well, we got to thank the bagpipers.  Let's get some plugs in before we get you guys out of here.  Hey, thanks again, guys.  Thanks.  We appreciate it.  Welcome back, man.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  It's great to have you back.  Thank you.  Looking forward to it.  If the midget thing don't work out and the fat chick on the unicycle and the fucking cream  pie and shit, you call us back.  We'll be able to have...  Actually, these guys are half midgets, actually, to tell you the truth.  So they'll be happy to come back and fucking play for you anytime, man.  All right.  Anytime.  And it's great to fucking have you guys back. 
[02:35:00]  And it's great to be able to say fuck.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Yeah, look at him.  I like the bagpipe theme.  I wouldn't mind having them around a few more times.  So, you know, get all the plugs out.  Seriously, you helped us out today.  Again, Monaghan, but we're the Monaghan Pipe Band.  M-O-N-A-G-H-A-N.  And our website is M-O-N-A-G-H-A-N-P-B dot com.  We have a lot of guys here.  We're in the Bronx and we're in Brooklyn and we go all over the city.  We compete all over.  We compete internationally.  And we're huge O&A fans. 
[02:35:30]  And you can call us, 516-457-9797.  And we're having a dance again in Brooklyn on Saturday night.  Come to our website.  Check it out.  All the great tunes of the Scottish and Irish pipes.  And, of course, all the beer you can drink.  Of course.  Yeah, and of course.  Is that a stereotype?  Anyway, yeah, and that's about it.  So thanks again for having us, guys.  And call us back anytime you need us to fucking wake up everyone at Starbucks for you, all right?  Thank you, mister.  That was good.  I think we got video and pictures of that, by the way. 
[02:36:00]  We'll get that up on the website in a little while.  You guys can play yourselves out of here.  Sure.  You don't have the big drum, but open the door, somebody.  This is going to get really loud.  Yeah, I'll open the door.  How about that one?  All right.  Here we go.  And then play in there for a couple of minutes while they're trying to work.  Do these guys have groupies?  Do they play?  I do.  Yeah.  Usually they're...  There they go.  You can see them on Pal Park leaving the studio.  Oh, it's not loud. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, slam the door, Hawk.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Let's go to Neil in Philly.  Neil, what's up today?  Good morning, guys.  Thanks for taking my call.  I wanted to, first of all, thank you guys for blasting out my ear with the bagpipes. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  But I was at Vaught's show in Redding this weekend, and he and Bonnie absolutely killed.  He and Bonnie actually...  Absolutely killed.  Good.  Thank you.  Never saw them live before, but they were fantastic.  I mean, there was a girl in the front row with a cop, and she wouldn't keep her mouth shut,  and both of them were just ripping on her.  Never seen anybody, a comedian, make a Colombian funnier. 
[02:37:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  I mean, the reality is, we say this all the time, we beat the hell out of Voss on the radio  program, but when it comes to hitting a stage, he's just unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  He's unbelievable.  I don't want people to confuse the issue.  He bombs a lot on this program.  I don't bomb a lot.  You can get tapes.  Get tapes.  Your average is up there.  You must be taking steroids or something, because your average is getting much better.  But I'm going to write a list of good bits I've done on this show, but here's the thing.  Hey, why did you call me the other day, and you want to talk, by the way? 
[02:38:00]  A couple things.  There's nothing, you know, just some idea.  Well, tell I'll be what.  There's no need to be sneaky here.  I'm not going to squeeze somebody out of the job.  One was settled today when you guys...  I was supposed to do Kid Chris on Friday, right?  Right.  Tomorrow, because I'm in northeast Philly this weekend.  So I talked to him, and he goes, I don't know if he can come in, because I don't want  all the pests to go crazy that I'm still an O&A guest, and I think they're pissed at  me, and this and that.  I go, look, I'm not like that.  They know I do other radio stations.  I just won't do, like, one or two.  Wait, I'm not to interrupt you, Rich. 
[02:38:30]  I had the same thing with him.  Yeah.  It was like, he's like, well, they were concerned that a lot of the fans would call in, or O&A  fans would be a problem.  It's like, well, first of all, you don't have to have calls come in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  And that's the same thing he told me.  So maybe he doesn't want O&A people in.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But so I said I'll straighten that out.  Right.  Okay.  And then the other thing is, I might do a tour with Florentine and Levy.  We wanted to set up a tour, but I don't know if there's a conflict of interest that I wanted 
[02:39:00]  to do.  Good.  I can save time.  I can go home after this.  There is actually a conflict of interest.  They're comics.  You know what I mean?  But we've worked with Florentine before and stuff.  I'm trying to get Florentine to do the dates with me and a tell.  Oh, thanks.  See if I was open those weeks.  No, I know you have to be.  So those were pretty much it, you know.  All right.  Well, you want to come by the other studio tomorrow to promote the gig in Philly?  Yeah, I would love to.  Well, how are you going to promote the show?  In Philly?  Yeah, you can promote it here as well, but we're on YSP. 
[02:39:30]  I'm allowed to come in.  Here's the thing.  When Ben, I said, can I come in today?  And Ben said, yes, I'm all excited.  I'm going to, what's her name?  Oh, I'm going to do the new show.  When I heard it on the radio, driving the other day, it just brought back good memories.  Right.  And people, they'll see how funny it used to be.  Honestly, we're not even worried, because we know it's just early on, and it is what  it is right now.  We always stink for the first nine or ten months.  Don't you worry.  Ben said, come in Thursday, and then he called me, and I'm all excited. 
[02:40:00]  Then Ben said, all right, meet at the XM studio.  And it was kind of like a girl saying, I don't want to go out with you anymore.  But, of course, I love XM, because you know what I mean.  All right, stop.  Stop talking.  Thank you.  Stop groveling, Rich.  You're not a nice guy.  I'm not groveling.  I love XM.  Shut up.  We explained it.  You're not a nice guy.  We explained it.  But the first few days, we just wanted it to be Anthony and I and Jimmy, because we're  just trying to get used to the place.  And starting tomorrow, we're going to open it up and start getting things done.  So come by tomorrow.  Oh, cool.  We've got Big A and Twitchell's doing the news, and they're going to do Yo Mama. 
[02:40:30]  They're going to battle Yo Mama style.  Doing Yo Mama jokes.  And then we've got Joe Rogan.  It's going to be a good show tomorrow.  It's going to be a busy show.  Yes.  How are you doing with the smoking?  I have a great plan, and it's working out.  Why does it keep smoking?  No, no.  Well, I cut back.  It keeps smoking.  Wait, when was the last time you had a cigarette?  About 45 minutes ago.  So you have a great plan, and it's working out.  I'm cutting back.  As of May 1st, I start dieting, so I lose a lot of weight. 
[02:41:00]  And then June 30th, June 30th, I quit smoking.  All right, cool.  I set a goal, and I got skin cancer in my ear.  I got to get cut out.  Bonnie said he always.  Do you really?  I think so.  That's what my doctor said.  Let me see it.  Yeah, that's bad.  Yeah, that's real bad, actually.  Okay, well, that's just a little thing.  I wouldn't worry about that.  That's how it's starting.  But that's never indicative of more to come.  Nah.  No, but it has nothing to do with smoking.  That was from the sun.  How busy are you today? 
[02:41:30]  Because they really want us to go to noon every day, as many days as we can.  And we'll go as far as we can, and then when we know we have nothing, we've got to get out of here.  That's obvious.  I say we force him from 11 to 12 to take smoking horror stories, just Rich Voss, in the studio with the callers.  Like, what happened?  Yes.  Because every time we talk to him about his smoking, there's an excuse.  Well, this is happening, so I can't quit.  I'm going to quit on my birthday.  I'm going to quit on the anniversary of my divorce. 
[02:42:00]  Bonnie said when she was in last time that he always picks some date, and then it comes by.  Is that what you're supposed to do?  Yeah, but not four months from now.  It's cool you're picking a date.  Here's what we'll do.  May 1st, you start dieting.  You're in great shape.  Here's what we'll do.  That's the one thing you have going for you is your body.  Here's what we'll do.  Not this Monday.  I'll do it the following one.  Give me one more week, and I'll do it.  How's that?  Cool.  Do you want to do that?  One more week what?  Why do you want the week?  Why do I want the week?  Why do you want the week?  To get mentally prepared.  I clean my house.  I've got to do stuff and get ready. 
[02:42:30]  No, but I don't give a shit if you ever stop smoking.  I'm just looking for good radio.  I'm giving you the opportunity at 11 o'clock, maybe 11.15.  We'll try to go a little past 11 today.  You take us to noon.  It's just you in the studio taking cancer horror stories.  Oh, I'll do that.  Yeah, I have no problem with that.  All right.  Am I allowed to smoke when I do it in the studio?  No.  No.  Okay, but I'll do it, yeah.  No.  No, all right?  Yeah, yeah.  A week for Monday is good because you've got to pick a date. 
[02:43:00]  That's fine.  Another week.  And you can plug the hell out of your show in Philly.  No, I don't care.  But you have to take the stories.  And I want the listeners to really call up with the stories.  But not now.  I know this show is mostly a comedy show, but I really want you to suffer for about 45 minutes.  You've made others suffer.  It's only right.  You should suffer proper.  All right.  So, but how's a week for Monday?  You want to do that?  You want to make a week to do with Edge Radio?  You know, you could see my progress.  I'll do a week.  Progress?  You'll come in with blood on your hands.  Bonnie's dead. 
[02:43:30]  The fucking house is on fire.  How you doing?  A little cranky.  I know.  Well, there's no burn marks on my floor like the other place.  Dude, when I first saw Rich's floor, it had like 30 black marks from his cigarettes falling asleep.  I'm like, you have your kids sleep here.  What's wrong with you?  You'll be one of those people that just burn up one day.  Of course, falls asleep with a cigarette in his hand.  How do you do that?  How tired are you?  You ever wake up because it reached your finger?  Yeah, you burned.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike in Fresno.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Just want to let you know, Monday, you guys scared the shit out of me, man.  I thought Anthony was kind of kissing ass.  I thought Jimmy was stifled.  I was like, okay, this is scaring the shit out of me.  The show is changing.  I don't want to listen anymore.  I put on the boneyard.  But then Tuesday, I put you on.  Man, you guys are still kicking ass.  I'm real happy for you.  Thanks.  So, thanks for not changing the show for SXM subscribers.  I think he's...  And, Opie, I got one more thing for you. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  He's kind of joking.  We weren't on Tuesday, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  That was his whole joke.  Marie.  Hi, guys.  Marie the trucker.  What are you hauling?  We're hauling Alaskan king crab.  Oh, hurry.  Oh.  Can't you send some our way?  I begged for some.  They wouldn't give me any.  Are they alive or no?  Oh, no.  No, they're frozen.  Hurry.  They're frozen. 
[02:45:00]  They're going bad.  Yeah.  She's probably...  By the way.  Yeah.  Speaking of seafood...  Oh, man.  Worked like a charm.  I went and I got some shrimp for some shrimp cocktail.  Oh.  And I got...  That's some of them shrimps.  I got like a pound of shrimp and we ate up most of the shrimp except for a few and then  we threw it out in this little wastebasket right next to the mousetraps.  Bam!  Bam!  Got two last night.  They smelled it, huh? 
[02:45:30]  They liked the shrimpers.  Did you do that on purpose?  No.  But my traps, I haven't gotten anything lately.  I've been putting the peanut butter in there and nothing.  Nothing.  You throw away seafood and then leave it in your house?  Well, no.  It was like, you know, it was dinner...  Overnight?  No, no, no.  It was dinner time.  Yeah.  And then we threw the shrimp away and then it was hours later and I was, you know, before  I went to bed, I took the garbage out knowing that it was shrimp and I saw my electric mousetraps  that that fine listener sent me. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Both blinking.  I'm like, yes.  They had to have smelled the shrimp and just went nuts.  Bored over it, thought it might be in there.  And they couldn't find it because it was in the wastebasket.  Nice kill.  And the traps were, you know, kind of in that same area.  So they probably smelled the shrimpers and went right in the electric mousetraps.  Saving the pelts?  I should have taken a picture.  I haven't taken a picture of the mice I've killed lately.  Dude, you're infested.  You know what?  We figured that we're up to like 20 kills. 
[02:46:30]  But you don't have rats.  And I'm not even exaggerating.  Not even exaggerating.  Last time I was keeping track, I was up to 12 or 13.  And there's been a few since then.  So I think I'm around 20.  Damn.  You're an ace.  But if you have mice, you don't have rats.  How do you?  What?  Yeah, they can't live together.  Yeah, because rats will eat the mice.  It's like rat, mice, scissors.  I'm reading a really creepy.  What if they're eating the mice, but you have so many mice that they just keep like replacing them?  Then the mice will get out of the house if there's rats there.  They'll leave?  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  You don't actually.  Like white people with.  I was absolutely thinking the same thing as was every other racist who enjoys this program.  Me and Jim used to go rat watching up in.  Remember that place we used to?  Yeah, 72nd up there by the train.  Yeah.  Just the bushes would rustle.  You would walk past and just hear.  And they move.  The bushes move.  And you go, why are the bushes moving?  And you look closer and there are rats infesting the entire area. 
[02:47:30]  You get that by Washington Square Park too after you leave the cellar at night on a weekend.  It's really late.  And you walk by the park and literally you can just stop for a minute.  You watch and you just watch it move with rats.  And now that they've taken a lot of those bushes out in the park, I think they want to un-disinfest,  if that's a word.  Yeah.  All you see is holes all over where the rats, it's creepy.  And the people that live right across the street have them all in their front yard.  Million dollar brownstones.  Yeah.  They have rats in the front yard.  But I can never understand living here. 
[02:48:00]  So, Marie, what do you got, by the way?  Well, yesterday when you guys left little Jimmy in the studio, you had me in tears.  Every time he'd shake that tender sense of this box, my eyes were just watered like crazy  and my old man sitting there laughing his ass off at me.  You were crying.  I was crying.  You had me in tears.  I know it's a bit, but damn, he sounded so poor, Lauren.  It's actually not a, it's actually not a bit, it's something, it's something, it's something 
[02:48:30]  that I do even at home when I'm sad because a lot of times, you know, you just kind of  feel left out and you just want, you want to just, you need sometimes a tender sentiment.  Unloved.  All right.  They need to make more tender sentiments.  Oh, yeah.  They're making more every day.  You know what?  Kind of like fortune cookies.  They're coming up with new sayings every day.  You know what?  Give us one.  All right.  Marie, just for you. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, there's a lot of tender sentiments in there.  Yeah.  Let's see one.  Box seems to be filled up today.  Pulling it out and you deserve to be respected.  That's for me.  It's a special tender sentiment.  Oh, you do.  All right, Marie.  Happy, happy hauling.  Thank you, sweetie.  All right. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  All right.  Goodbye.  All right.  Enough.  Jesus.  You know, we get it.  You cried.  You laughed.  You had fun.  You're hauling crabs.  Go fuck yourself.  We get it.  We're great.  Shut up.  Hey, you made tender sentiments for E-Rock.  E-Rock gets beat up on this show a lot and I don't like it.  What am I doing there?  No, there's a bunch.  Stop peeking in there, nosy.  Don't peek at the sentiments.  Don't peek at the sentiments.  Let me see it.  Can we get an example?  Bring it over.  Jimmy, what's this about?  E-Rock.  There's a bunch in there.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  All right.  I hear the-  E-Rock gets beat up a lot.  Right.  And I don't like it.  I don't like the way Eric gets yelled at.  Could you get a microphone, please, before I spit on you?  I think we should all get a box of tender sentiments based on-  I bring nothing to the table.  Based on what we do on this show.  Is this on?  Yes.  Is this on?  And what happens-  Is this on?  Eric gets yelled at a lot and he works hard and I don't like it.  I think that he sometimes deserves-  Touch that water again, please.  And I think that Hawk at times needs a tender sentiment and no one ever offers him one. 
[02:50:30]  And I think he's a sensitive dude and if it works for me, it should work for him.  Well, maybe an example of your tender sentiments, if you want to shake it up.  Do you ever get sad, Eric, when you get yelled at?  Honestly.  Once in a while, Jimmy.  Okay.  Obvious.  Shakes it.  Pulls one out.  Here's a tender sentiment for E-Rock.  Don't read it ahead of time.  You just read it.  A rhesus monkey should empty his diapers into your open mouth. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, there you go.  You should be feeling a little better about yourself.  Great tender sentiment.  Oh, take the box with you.  You never know when you're going to have to dip into the old box.  Candyman, what's up?  What's up, ONA?  Hey, Candyman.  What's up?  Boss, you suck. 
[02:51:30]  Thanks.  Hey, Jimmy, I want to tickle your balls a little bit for that tender sentiment shit.  That was hilarious.  Thanks, man.  I was just like the other fucking caller, laughing my dick off, listening to you shake that box.  Thanks, man.  It was just one of those little silly things.  It was one of the funniest endings to our program ever yesterday.  They're talking about it on Whackbag.  Ben is laughing his ass off outside the studio.  Ben, come in here.  That's all he does.  Now he's back to not producing, by the way.  Yeah, now he's off.  Come on in here.  I want to see what Ben is doing.  Ben now only works from 6 till 9. 
[02:52:00]  Hey, Ben.  Pat.  Thank God we both pat for the satellite show because he's said fuck about 80 times in the  two minutes he's been out there.  Yeah, we got Pat Cooper outside the studio.  Yeah.  This should get very, very interesting.  And he's got a real tough time hearing, so you got to yell to talk to him.  Are you kidding?  I can't even talk.  He's like, fuck it, fuck it.  Well, he'll put headphones on him.  Yeah, he just told me about an $8,000 hearing aid.  All right.  $8,000 hearing aid.  He's babbling to someone out there, and obviously that person just doesn't care. 
[02:52:30]  He's politely nodding.  I know.  He's so annoying.  Anyone else notice that?  Steve's like, you want to do IDs?  What the fuck are IDs?  I want to get paid to do fucking IDs.  Boss, you're going to have to sit here.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Because I want to.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  We haven't taken a break since we left the other studio.  Wow.  I hope people realize that.  I love you.  I got to take a leak.  Yeah, we got to take leaks, and when we get back, we'll talk to Pat Cooper. 
[02:53:00]  Hi.  I like to listen to Opie and Anthony when I'm feeling blue, just like the pills Uncle Henry  gives me before bed.  They make me feel all tingly down there, and my undies get tight.  Then Uncle Henry stares at me with a stopwatch.  I wish I could sleep on my tummy.  Hey, you're a crazy bitch, but you fuck so good.  I'm on top of it when I dream.  I'm doing you all night.  Stuck yourself down my back to keep her eye on. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, you're a crazy bitch, but you fuck so good.  I'm on top of it when I dream.  I'm doing you all night.  Stuck yourself down my back to keep her eye on.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  That's Buck Cherry, crazy bitch, Rich Vossen Studio, playing Comedy Cabaret Northeast Philly  this weekend.  Thank you, sir.  And we're doing, I'm not plugging this, but we're doing a Mitch Hedberg tribute on Sunday.  Where?  In Minneapolis. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, man.  I would love to go to that.  Yeah.  Are flights cheap?  Yeah.  JetBlue?  Yeah, I know.  I'm thinking Northwest, I think.  It's really cheap.  I would love to go to that, man.  Yeah, it's going to be a tell, a bunch of comics.  Yeah, very cool.  I've never been asked to do one of those tribute shows to a comic.  Jerry Red Wilson was a comedian that died.  Never been asked to do that.  And these are guys I know that die.  None of these fucking people that book them would ever ask me to do it.  It's really irritating.  Well, they threw me out of, you know what it is.  Bonnie was doing it because she's friends with Mrs. White, his friend, Lynn.  And so I was going out there. 
[02:54:30]  So they called me.  They go, do you want to do it on the show?  I mean, there's comics on it that, you know, we should easily be doing.  It's not even, it's not a matter of, you know, because I was, I mean, I knew Mitch.  But I mean, a guy like Jerry Red, who I was actually friends with.  Good friend.  You know what's so weird?  I met Mitch Hedberg for the first time two days before he died.  I was at the Caroline show.  Oh, yeah.  Pretty much the last show he did.  I was there.  We met.  We exchanged numbers.  He wanted to do our show.  I respected that guy a lot.  I thought he was so original. 
[02:55:00]  And then I think it was like two days, maybe three days later.  I don't know.  Something like that.  And he died.  When he died, we got, he died in Jersey.  And we got back to Jersey.  His wife was in the hotel.  So she said, come, we had, we picked her up that morning, the next morning or whatever.  Right.  She stayed at our house for two days.  Right when, let me tell you, it was the saddest, most creepy, you know, I mean, just.  Yeah, that's just not good.  But then once you showed me the checks he had, like $40,000 a weekend and stuff, I'm 
[02:55:30]  going, well, you're in the money now, babe.  You know what I mean?  I mean, they're making.  $40,000 a weekend?  Oh, him, Mitch?  $40,000 a weekend?  Yes, in some place.  Jimmy, calm down.  $30,000, $40,000.  But he didn't get an XM jacket.  What's that?  All right.  Hey, we got to get Pat Cooper in here.  He's losing his freaking mind.  Pat Cooper.  What'd he say?  He's not ready?  No, he wants big money.  All right, man.  You want, you want big money for this, Pat? 
[02:56:00]  And remember, I put you down.  I put you guys down.  And look what happened to you.  What are you handing me this damn thing?  What are you, can I sit down?  Good morning, good morning, good morning.  Good morning, Pat Cooper.  Harry Cooper.  Rich Voss, you like him?  We love Rich.  North is very funny.  Yeah, we just have a jacket.  I don't work for jackets.  I want a suit.  We discovered Rich Voss.  I did a show with Pat.  Who are you, Anthony?  That's Opie.  I don't look like an Anthony.  Not that you care.  I know you don't care.  I'm Opie.  That's Anthony.  I'm the Guinea.  That's Jim North.  He's the Opie. 
[02:56:30]  So where do we begin with Pat Cooper?  Pat.  First of all, legend in the business, Pat.  Much respect.  Well, you're very kind.  Thank you.  But I got to tell you something.  Let's go.  When you had that controversy years ago.  Sure.  Yeah, we played the audio on our show.  I screamed at you guys because I didn't understand.  I'm not a cop-out, but a fact.  I said, where are you going?  You're starting to sound like the other guy.  But the other guy, by fighting you, made you bigger.  And I told the other guy, you're going to make them bigger because the more you give 
[02:57:00]  them publicity, the more they're going to rise.  The guy didn't believe me.  I said, you don't own the words, the, him, about.  You don't own those words.  Other people have got a right to make a living.  You may not like what they do.  That's none of your business.  They got a right.  There's enough room out there.  Right.  That's when I ended my, no.  Then I didn't do a show no more because I told them, you can't be a dictator.  Them days are over.  You're making 90 billion.  What more do you want?  He didn't want anybody else to be doing anything even remotely near when he was there.  I got ideas from other comics.  If I didn't, I'd be calling you a liar.  Right. 
[02:57:30]  We all got ideas.  Not from these two guys because I'm too brilliant.  Are you talking about Cousin Brucie?  You found out.  That's why he's great.  It's really interesting, but he doesn't do Howard Stern's show anymore because of how  Howard treated us when we were working for the same company.  But look at what happened.  Look at what happened.  And by the way, he did play right into our hands because that was.  It's the second time.  You're interrupting me.  What is it?  I'm going to interrupt as much as I want.  Let me explain something.  Look at what happened.  Look, he's looking at me.  He's looking at me.  He's looking at me.  You didn't say nothing. 
[02:58:00]  No, no.  Fine, but you got paid.  Right.  And I told him, it's the man.  They're going to get paid.  They don't need your crap.  I said, not only that, now you're in their seat.  You're in his seat.  So the man's making half a billion.  How much more can you?  Wait, did you play with my people?  What are you making?  Snapping pictures?  We're snapping pictures.  We're taking pictures of everything.  This is not going to help your career.  You're like a lunatic.  But he definitely played into our hands is what I was going to say.  I'm sorry.  You speak the truth because he definitely played into our hands.  You can't.  Because, listen.  We knew if we irritated him enough, he would start talking about us.  And that would only make us bigger. 
[02:58:30]  We would have the talent to back him up.  But I try to explain that.  The more you fight, the more you fight.  I made a name not by my humor, although I'm brilliant, but by my controversy.  When you're controversial, you're special.  You stand there and go, that's the guy that said that, that, that, that.  When you do that, fine.  I gave this guy radio he'll never have in his life again.  You did great radio over there.  He's got tapes of me that I did.  Classic moments, Pat.  Thank you.  Classic moments.  And I think he kept his career going on a lot of those classic moments.  Well, my friend, that's not wrong with that. 
[02:59:00]  He did a lot for my career.  What's right is right.  Sure.  I did great for his show.  But what happens, he wants to be in a driver's seat.  And I say, man, not me.  I'm not a follower.  I'm a leader, I said.  I don't have to be.  I came here.  You invited me.  I didn't even know who he was when I got on there.  I became a regular.  I said, you know, pick me up with a car.  I don't ask you.  I come here with the train.  Rain, storm.  I come.  I deserve respect.  And if you don't give it to me, you can keep your shove that thing up your rear end.  I don't need it.  And I told him the truth.  I said, your wife's going to dump you.  Your mother don't like you. 
[02:59:30]  Your father don't like you.  Your children don't like you.  He said, what makes you say that?  Very simple.  If you were my kid, I would strangle you.  I said, if you were an Italian, you'd be already dead.  They'd fucking strangle your balls.  My father would say, kill that son of a bitch.  But you're a Jewish guy.  And the Jewish people say, ah, he's a talented boy.  So he says, tits and ass.  What does that mean?  That's why.  And I said that to him.  Remember what I'm telling you.  Your wife's going to dump you.  Not my wife.  She likes to play tennis.  That's why she's going to dump you.  She likes to play tennis.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  But do you really think he's bummed that. 
[03:00:00]  So what happened?  His wife got rid of it.  Oh, boy.  But let me ask you something.  It's not obligated.  Hold on.  Let me ask you something, though.  Is he bummed that his wife dumped him, though?  Is Howard Stern bummed that his wife dumped him?  Let me tell you something.  I'd be upset.  I was married 41 years.  I lost my wife last year.  Okay.  I would be devastated if my wife left me.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, see, Howard felt by giving you tennis lessons, by buying your kid a pony, 
[03:00:30]  that was going to be success.  My father bought me a pony.  Three days later, we ate it.  I mean, give me a break.  So he figures that's going to make, you know, Long Island crown.  I know the mothers.  She's got the sweetest mother and father on the planet.  But you're a Jewish mother and a Jewish father.  They would rather him be a doctor.  Right.  Or a schmuck would have been better.  But they stuck with him.  What are they going to do?  But he did.  He broke barriers.  What's right is right.  He broke barriers.  Never denied it.  Where do you go now?  You go for the paycheck.  Damn. 
[03:01:00]  Because that's what he did.  It's all right.  That's okay.  That's his business.  That's his business.  He's got a nice young lady.  He's going out with a beautiful girl.  I wish him no harm.  I wish him a million dollars a day.  But it's over.  A million dollars a day makes more than that.  My friend, it's over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We already know that.  You know, if he's there and he knows in his heart, because if he was smart, he wouldn't  betray his people on that show.  He'd have stood on that show.  He's like, I'm betraying my people.  Because a lot of those people are not going to go to the other network.  That's what I'm saying.  There's the go for the paycheck, which is all well and fine.  But, you know, you've got to have some consideration for the people you've got to be loyal to. 
[03:01:30]  Because the man, you know, Hitler wasn't satisfied with two countries.  He wanted three, then four.  Then he fucked up and went to the wrong country, and he got his ass kicked.  Yeah.  I'm not saying he's a Hitler.  Don't remind me.  But I'm bringing a point out.  It's lucky once in a while he throws something.  He's got a real good average, actually.  I've got other guys here, talk to them because I'm getting boring.  No, you're doing very well.  I love Pat Cooper.  Very well.  When you're talking about the old classic days, how many years do people just run around 
[03:02:00]  going, who told you that?  Who told you that?  That's right.  I mean, classic times.  I get that from the younger people who don't support me.  Yeah.  I try to explain it to Howard.  Howard, the younger people will support these two gentlemen because they're up to date.  I said, I am my own kind of guys.  I got my crowd out there.  They keep supporting me.  I try to explain it to Howard.  I said, your young people are not going to come and see me because my kind of humor  is left for them.  And that's honest.  I said, I'll tell you the truth. 
[03:02:30]  I said, listen to me.  I pack them in.  My people, when they start dying, I'm dead.  And when I start seeing half the houses, it's over.  And to say it's over is a compliment because you did it all.  I'm 77 in two months.  Where the fuck am I going?  You don't look 77.  Where the fuck am I going?  I work Monday night.  Who works Monday?  You didn't work Monday night.  Nah.  All right.  Pack the place.  And you had a hell of a career.  Pack the place.  I mean, but that's okay.  That's my kind of people.  I'm expecting these 20, 25, 30 years old.  They're still with tits and ass heads. 
[03:03:00]  I went through that.  I mean, hey, I'll give you an idea.  Two days ago, on my grandkids' eyes, I wouldn't lie to you, I get a letter for senior citizens  to get an erection.  My outer guard.  My outer guard.  You put a patch on your arm.  So I got a comedic mind.  I put the patch on my arm.  Three days, I mean, three minutes later, I started to smoke.  But this is what I'm getting.  Everybody's worried about my erection.  Yeah.  I'm happy if my body gets stiff.  But this is where I'm at.  To admit that you're an old guy, you had your moments, and you go about your life and your 
[03:03:30]  work, and when it's over, it's over.  I rehearse every Thursday.  And you're still working and having fun.  Anthony, every Thursday, I rehearse dying.  I tell my wife, do you like me this way or do you like me that way?  That's reality.  You're a morbid bastard.  No, no.  That's fucking reality.  Yeah.  Don't let nobody bullshit when they go, I gotta have your bullshit.  The bottom line is you're going down with all of us.  So understand that and enjoy whatever pleasures you got.  You know.  I don't hang out with comics.  Not because I respect even bad comics, because I know how tough it is to get up on that stage. 
[03:04:00]  Very hard, sure.  But when you hang out with other comics, it gets fucking crazy.  You gotta close the store once in a while.  Go to Whitley there.  Sit down there.  You know, hit on a broad with hair under the arms.  It's something different.  Here's a biography you want to give us.  Yeah.  I opened for him.  He killed.  Of course he killed.  Everyone knows that.  I mean, it was just like, damn.  Pat Cooper has all that, he has energy that the younger guys don't have.  I used to listen to Pat on Bob Grant, when you would do Bob Grant.  I did Bob many times.  We love Bob Grant, by the way.  Oh, my God.  I think it is. 
[03:04:30]  Hey, I used to do Imus.  What happened with Imus?  This prick, this prick made a statement that he inherited me from Stern.  And I said, wait a minute.  You inherited what?  You wouldn't know my talent on your best days.  I bailed him out in Las Vegas when they did a show the first time in Vegas.  Three o'clock in the morning, I got up to do a show.  And he didn't like comics.  So he liked me.  As I was doing Stern, I was doing him.  Stern never stopped me.  I said, who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?  Forget it.  Now, what was this?  About when?  So, this couple of years ago.  So now, he don't want me on the show anymore. 
[03:05:00]  I said, what are you?  Gee, what were you?  You ugly bastard.  Who were you?  I said, you suffer from scar tissue, you piece of shit.  How the fuck are you?  Who the fuck are you to tell me you inherited me?  You couldn't inherit your ass.  I said, fuck your farm and fuck your cows.  Cocksucker.  That pisses me off.  Wow.  Well, that's the fact, pal.  He's got a fucking farm.  He wants somebody to know he's saving their children.  He met his brother.  He's another fucking nerd.  You hear me?  You hear me, Don? 
[03:05:30]  You're a piece of shit.  What?  He listens to the show every day.  He loves our show.  What happened to you that made you so angry?  I was angry the day I was fucking born.  I didn't like my mother's attitude.  It comes with the territory.  My whole family fucking yelled.  Everybody yelled.  They never cried.  We fucking yelled.  Whether they're angry or not.  Oh, yes, the friends.  Who made the mackerel?  What time did you come home?  What the fuck are they?  I don't know about that.  What are you doing here?  I don't know.  We never went to church. 
[03:06:00]  We were barred.  Because we would yell out our prayers.  And then all the emotion had to be shoved down.  My friend.  Right?  No crying.  I used to get dizzy.  So I used to walk the street and be on the floor in two minutes.  I'd be on the floor like that.  I went to a fucking doctor.  I yelled at him.  He says, nothing you can do.  Go out and fucking yell.  Because if I stop yelling, I'll fall down.  Because of the adrenaline.  Yeah.  See, last night I was sleeping knowing I was going to do this show.  So the fucking foot was going like that.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  Back and forth. 
[03:06:30]  Got out of the train.  Nice.  Come here.  And you've got to contribute to the show.  What the fuck you want me here for?  Because I'm back.  What has he got to say?  Can this guy say something?  Is he a good guest?  Should we bring him back?  Those are the fucking things.  I don't need this shit.  I got back to slides.  You got on a train to do our show?  I thought we sent a car for you.  I don't want a car.  By the time I get out of the car, I could be here three and four times.  Back and forth.  That's a good point.  Car.  What do you expect?  You've got to spend the fucking money that you're making. 
[03:07:00]  Don't be a pig.  Always spend it.  Go out.  Have a great time.  Have some fun.  Right?  We're going to take it with you.  I just bought an apartment.  All right?  Because I'm there 20 years in my other apartment.  They want me out.  I got no lease.  I said, fuck you and your apartment.  So what do you do?  You go out and do something else.  I buy another one.  See?  And I go there.  The woman goes.  They look at you in the apartment.  They go.  You know, you have to go before a board.  Yeah.  I said, before a board?  Yeah.  Fuck you.  And fuck your board.  I said, I grab your balls, lady.  She goes, you seem like a nice guy.  I swear to Christ. 
[03:07:30]  She goes, why should we put you in front of a board?  She said, you want to pay a half a million dollars?  Cash?  The man's got cash.  What does a board mean in life?  He's such up to Lena.  He's up to Lena.  That means Italian.  You'll pick me out there.  I said, well, thank you, Mr. Schwartz.  You're the person.  You're not the one on the board.  You have a half a million dollars.  For fucking money, you're going to give me a blowjob.  Remember that?  Fucking money is the bottom line.  When they say it ain't the money, bullshit.  It's the fucking money.  And when you're born a dog, you can't die a cat.  Remember those fucking words?  Words of wisdom, man. 
[03:08:00]  Wow.  People are loving Pat Cooper on the show.  Hey, Pat, you want to throw on some headphones?  Some people want to talk to you and say hi.  Oh, well, you got to listen to the call.  Let me see if I can hear.  You got an audio?  I'm lucky I got a seat here.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Brian, you're on with Pat Cooper.  He might not be able to hear you.  He's got a hearing thing, but go ahead.  All right, I'll give it a shot.  Pat, when you were doing Stern Show in the 90s, man,  when he had you on, sometimes I'd just stop what I was doing.  You are such a funny fucker. 
[03:08:30]  And you bring an energy for a man 77.  You bring an energy that I hope you get to do a threesome  with Happy Typing Girl and Luchi 18.  And ONA, you fuckers rule.  Get little Jimmy more money.  I love you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know something?  You know something?  When you turn around and you say,  why are you yelling all the time?  So naturally, people are expecting you.  This is your...  I mean, if you say, good morning, how you feeling? 
[03:09:00]  They say, Pat, there's something wrong with you.  Yeah.  Why are you so low?  Okay.  I went for the Sopranos four times.  I told David Chase, don't ever call me again, ever.  This is my fucking minute you're taking away from me.  At that time, it was 75.  I said, every fucking thing I hear my tick,  tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.  I'm going to fucking die, and you're breaking my balls.  You don't know what to do with me four times.  You put Frankie Valli on, you should have put that Valli on.  What the fuck is over there?  I said, the guy can't fucking act, and he don't like it.  Fuck him, too. 
[03:09:30]  Then they put Lauren Bacall on.  She gets robbed, and she falls down.  Then that other ugly bastard, Sopkins Lee, I said,  I'm a fucking genius next to this shit.  I'm special, you dumb assholes, and you don't put me on.  So what happens?  Yesterday, Sunday, the guy mentions me on television.  He goes, you'll never pay anybody, but you'll pay Pat Cooper.  So I got a call from my friend.  As you see, I don't even have to show up.  I got fucking publicity.  Twenty-five million people heard the word.  They go, more fucking phone calls.  So what does it mean?  What does it mean?  You know what it means? 
[03:10:00]  Stand in the fucking light so they can see you.  And don't be afraid to take the shit if you can give it.  Yeah.  And understand?  Well...  This is going to cost you about $30,000.  Hey, hold on a minute.  Send me a check.  Indy Mike wants in.  Indy Mike, you're on with Pat Cooper.  Morning, guys.  Hello, Pat.  Hey, hi, I'm Andy.  Andy, Randy, whatever your fucking name is.  How are you?  God bless you.  Happy Halloween.  I guess I don't see you in October.  Hey, Pat.  You seem a little bit hostile.  I thought maybe Jimmy could hand you over his box of tender sentiments and pull something out.  Hostile. 
[03:10:30]  I am fucking hostile.  What do you mean, see you a little bit?  That's my fucking thing, man.  I'm hostile.  I tell the priest.  I went into the...  Listen, I got a confession.  I told the priest.  I ain't telling you a fucking thing.  How does that grab your father?  I don't tell nobody shit.  So that's my craziness.  My father beat the shit out of me, but he don't go to confession.  He's a fucking hypocrite.  So what does that tell you?  You stand down and you be counted.  Seven, eight, nine, ten.  You're out.  That's the fucking story.  I'm up to six right now.  I got four more digits and it's all over. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  Go back to bed.  What was the Pat Cooper upbringing like?  What was...  It was no upbringing.  It was a downbringing.  Because they taught you you get nothing.  Was that it?  You get nothing.  You want to go out and work for it.  You don't like it.  You learn that young.  My father says, there's a fucking door.  It goes out and in.  You don't want to stay here.  Go do it.  I came here when I was 11 years old, he told me.  I ran away 14 times.  Nobody found me.  What the fuck does that tell you?  Listen to this.  I'm crying.  What's the matter?  My mother wants to put my head in the oven. 
[03:11:30]  So the woman goes, that means she loves you.  Let her put your fucking head in the oven and let her fucking love you.  You sick bastard.  So she tells my mother, I said, fuck.  I didn't say fuck.  I said, fuck.  How does that grab you?  My mother beat the shit out of me again.  So there's your answer.  I've not heard a lot of love in your childhood.  I got more fucking love on my pick and respect for people and care for people than people imagine.  My friends who know me over the years, I'll give you my soul if I love you and I care about you.  But that fucking word love is dangerous. 
[03:12:00]  Fucking dangerous.  Never tell a woman you love her.  Never.  No?  No.  I told my wife I adore you.  Love is shit.  She says, you what told me?  I never heard that.  You're going to hear it.  But you never told me I love you.  I don't fucking love you.  I adore you.  I adore you.  Now honeymoon.  What are we going to do?  It's up to you.  You want to play cards?  You want to get this thing on?  I said, you want to fuck with the lights on or with the lights off?  You want to sell mine or you don't want to sell mine?  That's my comedy humor.  And I married her 41 fucking years and I lost her a year ago.  And the stern people, these cocksuckers, don't even call up and say, Pat, I'm sorry for your loss. 
[03:12:30]  Are you shitting me?  Now, pricks.  Now, that's bullshit.  I may hate you, Opio and Ant, who the fuck you guys are.  I may hate you.  But I'll tell you one thing.  I'll pick up a phone and I don't want to see you anywhere.  Your family get hurt.  I don't want to see you get hurt.  I may disagree with you because you're not that good looking.  And they should put the light dimmer here.  If you're looking for a fucking romantic world, you've got shit to worry about.  It's a good thing you're in the fucking morning because mid-afternoon you're in deep shit.  He's got a shot that blondes are in.  You know what I'm trying to say?  Blondes on Second Avenue, they love guys like that. 
[03:13:00]  Pat Cooper just killing for us.  Dude, you know, we played your audio when you talked about, well, you confronted Howard  and said it was bullshit that he had a gag order on us.  And that's when we started respecting you.  Even though you took your shots at us, too.  But we don't give a shit about that, to be honest with you.  It wasn't to defend him.  That wasn't the idea.  I didn't give a fuck he made $90 million.  But you couldn't believe that he would actually put a gag order on it.  I was pissed off that he would turn around and make you guys get hurt. 
[03:13:30]  I would have said, you sent who in the church to get laid?  I would have called you, Opie, where's the church?  I want to come there.  That's funny.  Where the fuck is your sense of humor in the world?  Where's funny?  It's fucking funny.  They're worried about if you call Tom Cruise's daughter, Susie.  Who gives a fuck?  I mean, if you got humor, people get up in the morning, got a tough day, you make them  laugh.  You get a wacky guy like me, you make people feel good.  That's good.  The money will always be there, man.  Always be there.  Fuck the money. 
[03:14:00]  Listen, I got a few dollars.  I told my daughter, you know, I gave her house or whatever they want.  I said, at the last day, I'm going to put a 10 cents in the fuck-a-meter.  It's gone, the fuck-a-money.  It's fucking gone.  You got what I got.  I gave them everything.  So I bought an apartment on East Avenue A.  Okay?  I'm respectful.  I bought a yarmulke.  You know, in case the fucking, in case the wind shifts.  You know?  And I go there, and I'm going to live amongst my Jewish friends.  There you go.  And they're wonderful people.  Because, see, years ago, years ago, I used to say something at the table funny. 
[03:14:30]  And my father goes, what are you, a buffooner?  What do you give you the right to talk in your mouth?  If I was a Jew, another mountain boy.  Because the Jews were the best comets on the planet.  I've never seen, I mean, I grew up with the greatest, the fucking greatest Jewish comic.  Bloody Bruce?  Shecky Green, in my opinion, was one of the greatest nightclub comic on the planet.  Jack Carter's and these kind of guys.  Now, the young people today don't know that.  And these two gentlemen here worked their way. 
[03:15:00]  Their style here was not years ago.  There was no word stand-up.  You're an entertainer.  He goes, what if my brother's an entertainer?  What does he do?  He does everything.  But then I would stand-up.  I got a dentist at Red Bass.  He's drilling me, drilling me.  He wants to be a fucking comic.  I said, do me a fucking favor.  Do I want to be a dentist?  Do I want to be a fucking dentist?  Fill the fucking hole and leave me the fuck out of here.  He goes, well, Pat, I want to tell you a story.  Fuck your story.  I said, do I want $380?  Fill the fucking hole.  You carpenter. 
[03:15:30]  Let's go back to the phone.  It's Jay in Jacksonville for Pat Cooper.  Jay.  Is that it?  And Pat Cooper needs to make it.  No.  No.  Hold on.  We keep going, Pat.  We keep going.  Where?  What time do you get out of this thing?  I don't know.  I got to go back and do Stern.  What time do you get out of this thing?  Yeah, he's going to want you on after this appearance.  I'll tell you right now.  Hey, Jay, what's up?  Hey, we need some inspirational tapes from Pat Cooper to get our lazy bum asses out and  do something with our lives.  Yeah, inspirational tapes.  A lot of people sit around and don't feel much with their lives. 
[03:16:00]  I swear to you, but a guy, see when I got DVDs are blank.  You fill it in.  Whatever makes you fucking happy.  Fill it in.  In other words, use your imagination.  Don't depend on anybody to give you a lift.  Give yourself a lift.  Everybody's got talent.  And remember what's more important, the doctor or the plumber.  Fuck the doctor.  The plumber will always fix your leak.  Remember these words.  Lawyers are full of shit and doctors are full of shit. 
[03:16:30]  I got hearing aids cost me eight fucking grand.  I can hear an aunt fart across the room.  I can't hear my friend right next door to me.  So watch out for medical assholes who turn around and say, you're going to hear.  I can't hear cock.  Did you hear me?  I can't hear cock.  Open the head to be talking to me for 40 minutes.  I don't know what the fuck they're saying.  I said to myself, I got a bluff.  I got a fucking bluff.  I know I'm off the air when they kick me into the table.  Right now I got a fucking sore on my foot. 
[03:17:00]  And I ain't started yet.  Holy shit.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt.  Hey, Pat.  How you doing?  Huge fan.  God bless you.  I'll be out there in November at the Pack Shop Theater.  Fuck Westbury.  I have to go to the Poconos and tell my wife I love her just to see you.  He loves you.  Listen.  He loves you, Pat.  Pal, what would you say to Jesus if he came back?  I don't know if he heard you.  What would you say to Jesus if he came back? 
[03:17:30]  Take the nails out of your fucking hands.  You're messing up the carpet.  Holy shit.  Jesus is a man.  No more than a man.  He did not go through granite on a Friday.  I was a prickly for 13 years.  I went through granite every fucking day.  Nobody gave a shit.  But you got to be a realist.  The man was an evangelist.  He tried to do great things around the world.  God bless him. 
[03:18:00]  Moses, he split the water.  Whatever.  But always remember the truth.  It never happened that the guy went through granite.  Bullshit.  I tried three times.  I got a fucking headache.  Don't listen to the bullshit and everybody telling you, put in the kitty.  Put in your ass, the kitty.  A lot of people with the religion.  Religion is dangerous.  Let me tell you something.  I believe in what I believe.  I trust and respect everybody.  They love Jesus.  They love God.  I got my own love.  Don't be bullshit and say, well, God is going to save us.  Nobody is going to save you but yourself. 
[03:18:30]  And when you give to another person and honestly really care and want to help somebody, that's the bullshit.  Not when they get, you know, I get, I swear to you, I get big, big letters from Indian.  Indian.  Indians in Iowa.  Who the fuck has thought Iowa was, but Idaho was potatoes.  I'm getting fucking Indian feathers.  I'm getting the jinx-y things they send to me to help the kids who are over there freezing.  So I said, what are you doing?  They're freezing.  Send them money?  No.  Send them a fucking blanket.  So I sent them a fucking coat and a blanket.  I got insulted.  What's the matter?  You got no money?  What the fuck you want from me? 
[03:19:00]  The guy's freezing.  What are you going to put a dollar on your ass?  It's snowing out, you sick bastards.  Well, you got an attitude.  Well, fuck you.  Don't call me about 973 feathers.  One more feather, I become a fucking turkey.  You got any thoughts on the afterlife?  What do you think happens?  Afterlife?  There's no afterlife.  Nothing.  This is it.  You are now in hell.  You are right now in hell.  Yeah.  You can't make it.  It's over.  After this, you're dust.  You're part of the fucking woodwork.  I don't believe in afterlife.  No heaven, no... 
[03:19:30]  Listen to me.  My father had an under...  My father never went to school.  A fucking genius.  You know what I said you are?  Sperm.  You're a fucking liquid.  That's all you are.  You come out of my balls.  That's all you are.  So you think you come out of my balls, you're going to go to heaven?  And who the fuck wants anybody to come out of my balls?  And there's your answer.  That's fucking reality.  You come out of my balls.  Who the fuck you think you are?  I said, come out of your balls?  I thought the teacher...  My father calls me a liquid.  So the teacher says, bring your father here.  My father loses a day's pay. 
[03:20:00]  Goes over.  What's your problem, teacher?  She said, well, that's a filthy thing to say.  Let me tell you something.  You come out of your father's balls.  How does that grab you?  She goes, well, you have an attitude.  Fuck you.  He went home.  Okay.  Let's go to Joe in New Jersey.  Take the nails out of your hand.  You're bleeding on the carpet.  Joe, what's up?  You're ruining the carpet.  I just wanted to say, I've been a fan of Pat Cooper for a long time.  I used to listen to him on the Hoo-Hoo Show before you guys were around.  Yeah.  By the way, big fan.  Welcome back to regular radio. 
[03:20:30]  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, Joe.  I think you're great.  But Pat Cooper, you are one funny son of a bitch.  God bless you, buddy.  You remind me of my uncle Vincent.  I swear to God, I feel like I'm in Sicily listening and sitting down at the table with this guy right now.  I think any Italian family has somebody like Pat.  You're a one-of-a-kind, but doing some uncle or something that's just loud and funny and just a pizza.  My uncle's and aunts and aunts.  No disrespect.  My uncle said, I'm bringing my wife over. 
[03:21:00]  My uncle was a good-looking guy.  My uncle, Matt Clark, gave her a look like a fucking nothing.  Good-looking, very suave.  He said, I'm bringing over my wife.  Why do you meet my wife?  And you expect, you know, in those days, was not the plan to come off the boat.  So I'm standing by the pier by the gangplank, and I go, Uncle, where's my new aunt?  He goes, I'm standing next to her.  Edward G. Robinson with coils.  She's pocket-tanging like Edward G. Robinson. 
[03:21:30]  That's his wife.  This fucking guy is handsome.  He said, it's not the looks.  He says, but when I come home from work, she bathes me, and she cooks for me.  And when we have sex, ah, that's it.  Wait, of course, I got to go to work the next day.  That's how they survive.  Today we want to bang, bang.  I got laid 20 times.  I got laid 30.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  I was in my teams after the first time.  I had to go to a fucking doctor to find out how to sit down.  I got laid 30 times.  I had a broad 90 times. 
[03:22:00]  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  I got one sperm count now.  I'm saving you for later.  They're all full of shit when they tell you, ah, I got this boy.  I had a manada toire.  I told a broad, you want a manada toire?  I don't like sauce on my food.  What the fuck is that?  You don't like sauce on your food.  So don't listen to the bullshit.  Masculinity.  You know when you know a man is a man, when he walks in the room and he can say, hiya,  you know that fucking guy.  Stay away from him.  That cocksucker will beat your brains out.  Not these fucking bullies.  We got a lot of bullies.  Yeah.  Watch out for the bullies.  Or when he looks like... 
[03:22:30]  Most of the bullies I know are homosexual.  And why are they homosexual?  Because to protect their fucking homosexuality, they want to shout, take that side.  I'll take your tongue out, put it in your nose.  By that time, they're tired.  Fucking bullies.  I love bullies.  They're full of shit.  There's a guy who's trying to cover up for something.  I know a guy with no arms was a killer, so don't fuck with me.  No fucking arms.  They call him Mr. Nobody.  Kill you.  How'd he do that?  He with his legs.  He with his legs.  That's right.  He'd fucking destroy you.  He'd put you in a ham hock.  I was all over. 
[03:23:00]  Let's go to Lou on Long Island.  How did you get this fucking show?  You guys ain't got a fucking way to do it in a fucking hour.  Dude, we've been doing radio for four hours already today.  We got at least another hour.  Hey, 90 million.  Nice.  Do you like 90 million?  When you go home, you count.  Hey, here's how they count.  I hate them.  I'm working nine, four fucking hours.  What's that noise, honey?  That's the money.  That's the money.  Shut up and go back to bed.  I'm tired.  Fuck you.  Then die.  Time to fuck around.  I'll take your fucking job now. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, well, listen.  I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll add another hour for half the money.  Half of nothing.  That's a good deal.  Let's say hi to Lou on Long Island.  Lou.  Hey, Pat.  I don't know if you remember me.  I met you the first time with Louie Primer at Westbury Music Fair.  That was a great time for me because that guy's one of the greatest entertainers of all time.  Louie Primer.  God bless his soul.  God bless his soul.  We were in your dressing room when you came in and you were pissed off that Louie put his truck,  his bus, in the spot for your limo.  Yeah.  You know what else got pissed off?  You know, they didn't want to pay him fully because he didn't play the trumpet. 
[03:24:00]  He couldn't play the trumpet because he had a bad heart.  So they turned around and said, Louie, you're going to have to take 10% off.  You went fucking nuts.  He said, what do you mean taking 10% off?  He goes, well, you didn't play the fucking trumpet.  He says, well, they came here to hear the trumpet.  He said, that's your fucking persona.  You sing the songs and you play the trumpet.  This is how sick fucking producers are.  He didn't play the trumpet.  Okay?  So the poor bastard died.  He was in a coma for six fucking months, six years.  Wait a minute.  He woke up, played the trumpet, one song, and one fucking died.  Yeah, he was sick at the time. 
[03:24:30]  That's why he didn't play the trumpet.  But I tell you, we were in your dressing room with you and your wife, and I didn't stop laughing  for 20 minutes because I think you did 20 minutes on Louie's bus in your parking spot.  Well, listen, he was not only a great talent.  He used to call me on the stage just to break his balls.  I mean, we had more fucking fun.  I used to do the Italian dog.  I told him I had a dog he would speak to in Italian.  He's hot.  I said, tell the dog.  I said, Vin, I got a dog.  Go back and he barked.  You know, he would fucking go nuts and soup a thing like that.  But what a, hey, great ladies, man.  Great ladies, man.  Yeah, I've got a recording of that thing when you went up on stage making fun of his toupee. 
[03:25:00]  You got that?  That's worth about $30.  Sell the fucking thing, you sick bastard.  Put it up on your bed.  All right, thanks, bro.  Do you have audio on that?  Send that in.  It would be fun to hear.  Yeah, let's go to Houston and say hi to Reed.  Reed, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  Buried a big-nosed Jew.  Pat, I just wanted to ask you if you've ever been to prison.  What?  You ever been to a joint?  Ever been to prison?  Have you ever been?  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Always an honest guy.  Let me tell you something.  No, it's not a question of being honest.  It's a question. 
[03:25:30]  You've got to be an asshole to go to prison.  You don't do things stupid.  You obey the rules and regulations of your society.  But I'll tell you what.  I was in the fucking army.  That was the funniest guy in the fucking army.  The funniest cocksucker in the army.  All I told him.  I said, give me the fucking gun.  I'll kill anybody.  Where the fuck are they?  Where are these Koreans?  They let me go.  They let me go.  Because they didn't understand my fucking humor.  I'll give you five days until the guy's a wacko.  I swear to the wacko.  They didn't give me a gun.  They found it was Italian.  Give him a spoon.  Put him in the kitchen.  A fucking spoon.  What are you fucking guys, crazy?  The southerners. 
[03:26:00]  God damn mafia.  I ain't no mafia, you rat bass.  Give me a fucking Tommy gun.  Tommy, where are you?  Tommy, where are you?  All right, let's go to George in Chicago.  George, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Pat Cooper is killing today.  Hey, George, do me a favor.  There's a theater in the Chicago area, the Chicago Theater.  Tell those assholes, if they don't know what the book of Pat Cooper, they're fucking dickheads.  You tell them I'm fucking insulted, they turn me down.  What the fuck?  Are they stupid?  Are they fucking stupid in Chicago?  How dare they fucking insult my intelligence? 
[03:26:30]  Turned out.  This is my fucking country.  I demand a reconk.  Dad, we want to see you in Chicago.  Are you ever detourced?  You tell those rat bastards they don't know what to book.  They book book.  You know what they do?  They book Hitler in a Jewish neighborhood.  That's how fucking stupid they are.  I turn around.  They put my name up.  They go, right now, we don't know if there's crowds around.  Fuck your crowd.  They're there.  I'll take the door.  I'll take the door.  They backed off.  Because you've got 30-year-old people who don't know me.  All right?  There's a place called Foxwood.  I worked at a pack all the time.  Now you've got the Mohegan son. 
[03:27:00]  I want a tape.  As you want my tape, give me your tape.  I want to know what the fuck you do.  You want my fucking tape, you fucking asshole.  You insulting cunt that you are.  Who the fuck are you?  You want my fucking tape, you sick motherfucker, you asshole in the dirt, you piece of shit.  You ought to be a shame to yourself.  I says, you fucking lowlife insulting me.  I packed fucking rooms.  Are you thinking about it?  Who the fuck gave her the job?  A deaf mute?  Cocksucker.  A tape.  What are you?  An amateur?  I don't wake up yet. 
[03:27:30]  A tape?  Yes, you know.  Is that an insult?  Of course.  But that's the insult.  So you know what happens?  She won't book you.  Fuck him.  I got four fucking agents.  I said, Atlantic City.  Never had a problem in Atlantic City.  I put 5,800 people Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, middle of the week at the Hilton.  I said, she goes, well, you did me a favor with the prices.  I said, no, no.  Bloomingdale that day was on sale.  So I went on sale.  I gave you my sale price.  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  Only in March.  Now she says, I want to bring you back. 
[03:28:00]  Now you got to pay.  All right.  I said, I don't have the budget.  I said, but that rat bastard that you booked over the weekend, who came from fucking Australia,  who didn't bring in shit, how you paid 150 a fucking night?  I did 5,800 people.  You have to think about it?  Fuck the Hilton.  Okay?  Fuck them all.  How dare they?  You know what's wrong?  Nobody stands up to these cocksuckers.  Nobody tells me, who the fuck you think you're talking to?  I'm a fucking tradesman. 
[03:28:30]  I'm a craftsman, you asshole.  I'm fucking dynamite, you fucking no-talent piece of shit.  And you're going to tell me you're going to direct the boat?  You're not even a sailor.  Get the fuck off the boat.  You sick cocksucker that you are.  Embarrassing me.  A man of my caliber.  Now that I'm living with the Jews, I got my yarmulke.  Fuck all of you.  Let's go to Terry in Philly.  Terry, what's up?  Yeah, this is a great stuff I've heard in a long time.  Fuck you, too.  What's up, Terry? 
[03:29:00]  I'm only kidding you.  Don't mind you, but fuck you anyway.  Terry, you got to start.  Terry, Terry, you got to start over.  Start over.  I want to know what Pat thinks of Robin Clivers.  Is she as big of a phony as he is?  Robin Clivers is a myth.  She's no longer, she's not there.  They don't think she's there.  She's not there.  She had the balls to write a fucking book about nothing.  Anytime you start a book with Once Upon a Time,  it'll work for Disney.  What the fuck you doing with Stein?  She's not a bad person personally,  but she's a loyalty to him.  Gary Delabato, another Scott tissue. 
[03:29:30]  This person, bum, makes a statement that I abused  Howard Stern's daughters.  He said, I got the tape to prove it.  Let me tell you, you fucking asshole.  Bring the tape here,  and I'll kiss your balls in Macy's window  that I said anything bad about his daughters.  I don't pick on people's children,  you fucking Scott tissue bastard.  Remember, you got talent because you're ugly.  Anytime they're on a book,  they say, get an ugly fuck,  they get you, Gary.  And remember,  when your mother wanted fucking tickets to the show,  who did you call, you asshole?  You called Cooper, didn't you, you fucking bum?  When my wife turned around and died, 
[03:30:00]  did I hear from you?  You're no talent,  disrespectful,  cocksucker,  Scott tissue motherfucker.  How's that grab you?  You piece of shit.  You disrespectful fuck.  You're a disgrace to the Italians.  One point.  Say,  cinqui,  novi,  otti.  You lose.  Wow.  Fucking assholes.  And you know something?  Don't get on bad Cooper.  It's unfair.  If you two guys would say,  knock the shit out of me,  then you got to give me equal time on your show.  That's fair.  All right?  That's what I tell all these guys.  You want to knock my brains, 
[03:30:30]  you tell Howard,  he knocks my fucking brains.  One time,  I'll come out climbing on that fucking guy  because I came this close  to beating the fucking brains.  I'm not a fighter.  I'm scared of everything.  But I don't fucking bite his nose off.  I don't fucking bite his nose off.  He set me up.  Yeah.  Three guys,  he put in the cars,  he said,  I bad mouth to him.  I said,  let me tell you some,  you asshole.  Why would I need three guys to kill you?  I bad mouth to you every day.  What the fuck good is it?  Who the fuck are you?  When do you walk on water?  I said,  I'm knocking your fucking ass.  I can't fight.  I'm the fucking worst.  I'm the worst.  See,  if they run toward me,  I run toward them. 
[03:31:00]  I have no sense of direction.  You understand?  So I turn around  and I said,  step outside.  He said,  we are outside.  Well,  now you're telling me you're cunts.  But anyway,  that's one of the best tapes  he's ever had of me.  And the three guys,  the cowards,  ran out of the closet  and they run down the street  because they wanted to be noticed.  I says,  Howard,  you're my friend.  Your first thing you say is,  wait a minute.  I know Pat Cooper.  He won't badmouth me.  He can tell me to my face.  He's always said what's on his mind.  He didn't defend me.  And I went,  I mean,  I went after.  I got the fucking cam boy shaking.  I was,  I was,  and I said,  good thing Howard didn't stand. 
[03:31:30]  He's nine feet tall,  you know.  But I don't like to do that.  I'm not a tough guy.  I'm not a fighter.  I don't tell people to stand.  But you say things right  to people's face.  You don't need to go behind  anyone's back.  Listen to me.  You'll always remember.  Remember this.  When you can tell John Gotti,  step outside.  And they all look at you.  You hear what I said,  John?  Step the fuck outside.  He said,  Pat,  don't get nervous.  Now he knows I'm putting him on.  Otherwise,  I'm fucking,  I'm fucking dust today.  Yeah.  That's my humor.  Right.  That's my humor.  You actually did that?  That's the best fucking humor in the world. 
[03:32:00]  I'm sorry?  You did that?  20 times.  Wow.  Sam Gravano come over and he goes,  you know,  you're starting to get in.  It's like,  am I talking to you,  Sam?  Did I fucking talk to you,  Sam?  Step outside.  He goes,  we are outside again.  It's like,  what the fuck are we in now, Sam?  But you know something?  Hey,  I did his daughter's wedding.  Yeah.  I had the wise guys,  you know,  I'll tell you the truth.  Pat,  for the old ladies,  I'm doing this here in the afternoon  in Long Island.  I'm my grandkids.  Pat,  these old,  they all got big crosses,  they're all wearing black,  but I mean,  you want to cry, 
[03:32:30]  you know,  they're the backbone of the Italian culture.  So the guy said,  Pat,  the old man wants to say hello to you.  Now,  you know,  the Italians,  the old man is the big cheese.  He's in the dark,  there's two guys,  one on the left,  one on the right,  and I can't see him.  And an arm comes out,  he goes,  Pat,  how are you?  You need anything?  I said,  no,  I'm trying to find out  who the fuck this guy is.  No,  no,  I said,  I forget.  That night,  they do John Gotti's wedding.  They said,  Pat,  the old man wants to see you.  I go there,  here's this guy in the dark again,  a guy on the right,  a guy on the left.  Pat,  you need anything?  He said,  what are you,  a fucking franchise?  I swear the fuck I said,  what is that,  a wooden fucking arm? 
[03:33:00]  I said,  this guy's everywhere.  Till today,  I never knew who that guy was.  I said,  we don't tell you who he is.  I said,  I don't think there's nobody there.  There was a guy holding a wooden arm  with a fucking sleeve on it,  going back and forth.  I mean,  like a schmuck,  I'm shaking his hand.  Let's go to New York.  You did John Gotti's wedding?  Yeah,  I did.  It was me,  Connie Francis,  me,  Connie Francis,  George Kirby,  and Jay Black.  Oh,  wow.  That's a good.  And you talk about Federer.  I was peeing,  and a guy was peeing on my leg, 
[03:33:30]  just like Johnny Carson.  I said,  Johnny Carson peeing on my leg.  No,  no.  And Jilly Rizzo,  quite a few years ago.  I'm there with me and my wife,  and Johnny Carson's bombed out of his fucking gourd.  I'm in there taking a leak,  and Johnny Carson's here on my shoe.  I go,  oh,  oh,  you're peeing on my fucking shoe.  I'm Johnny Carson.  Give the fuck up your mother Carson.  Get the fuck you pee off my shoe.  Jilly walks in.  Hi,  what's the matter?  I said,  Johnny Carson's peeing on my shoe.  He said,  well,  he's Johnny Carson.  Fuck you,  Jilly didn't pee on your shoe.  Now I got to go home and change  with this fucking pee on me. 
[03:34:00]  But the prick never forgot me.  They introduced it.  They want to put him on the show.  He says,  I don't know.  He's not for me.  That's because he peed on my shoe  and he's red bastard.  I said,  that fucking assholes,  because he was drunk in those fucking days.  Yeah.  All right?  Frank Sinatra,  okay?  Big name.  All right?  He said,  Pat,  take this out of your rack.  That's,  do I tell you what songs to sing?  That was the end of me with him.  Why do you want you to take something out of your head?  Because he wants to show that he's your fucking boss.  Don't you get the message?  Oh,  just a little power show.  Pat Henry,  17 years.  Tom Dresden,  Ted Dresden,  10 fucking years.  You become his comic.  I ain't nobody's comic. 
[03:34:30]  I said,  Frank,  don't tell me what to do up there.  They're waiting for you.  The fuck you think they're waiting for me?  And he didn't know what to say  because nobody's supposed to talk to him like that.  Who the fuck are you?  I told my father to stop breaking my balls.  So who the fuck are you?  But then,  they don't deserve the respect.  They don't deserve my respect  when you're trying to bullshit me.  I said,  what the fuck?  You kidding me?  So Julie says,  well,  the old man,  he's not the fucking old man.  My father's the old man.  When the fuck did Sinatra become the old man?  I said,  tell him not to call me kid.  Hey,  kid,  an Indian kid.  I'm not a fucking kid.  That was the end of me.  10 days later, 
[03:35:00]  I worked downtown to Fremont.  You went from Sinatra to downtown to Fremont,  worked with a guy called Joe Williams,  not a great singer.  They didn't make fun of me,  you dumb fucking asshole.  You went downtown  after working with Frank.  You worked with Frank.  Three years later,  everybody went downtown  because Frank went downtown.  I said,  if Frank went,  worked in a pile of shit,  you all follow him.  You'd all follow him.  You ain't got backbone,  you fucking no-life,  cocksucking no-good,  talented assholes.  I said, 
[03:35:30]  no,  Frank is downtown.  It was just one of those things.  Fuck you,  brother.  How's that grab you?  I worked with Joe Williams,  one of the greatest singers  on the fucking planet.  I got more money  working with Joe than with Frank.  Oh,  you know,  you're working with Frank,  you're going to get $30.  $30?  What are you kidding me?  I get $3,000.  Not with Frank.  You're working with Frank.  I'm working with Frank.  Yeah,  Frank said,  Frank did,  Frank did.  I like the man.  I respect the man.  Fuck you,  Frank.  Don't run with my life.  Who the fuck are you?  And my wife goes,  jeez,  Pat,  you're not working with him again. 
[03:36:00]  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Now we're doing the benefits  six years later.  Oh,  thank God.  Peggy Lee,  Pat Cooper,  Frank Sinatra,  and the stepbrothers.  You know,  the pap dancers.  Frank's working in Vegas.  I said,  Pat,  I got to go on first  because I got a show back.  That's the Frank.  Whatever you say.  Hey,  Frank,  he's talking.  He said,  I'm going to do three songs.  He starts the fourth song.  I run out.  How many times I told you  fucking three songs?  What are you fucking sick?  He starts to laugh.  I says,  what is your fucking peg?  He's waiting there in the back.  She's getting fucking nervous breakdowns. 
[03:36:30]  And now people are laughing.  Four years later,  we're roasting Pamela Soda.  Sinatra comes over to Pac  and I do the fourth song.  Damn a fucking true story.  It's not the shit you're right with  with Robin Quivers.  My mother beat me up.  My father.  You just like to beat me up.  You're ugly.  That's why.  Let's go to John in New York.  John,  what's up?  Mr. Cooper,  how are you?  God bless you.  The last time I saw you,  I think it was in Staten Island,  you were working with Frank Jr.  Oh,  yeah,  Frank Jr.  Let me tell you about Frank Jr.  This is a classy, 
[03:37:00]  no,  this is a gentleman,  a classy,  fine gentleman.  But to live under your father that way  is very difficult.  But he's a gentleman  and he does a nice job.  He's a fine man.  Trust me.  And I can pick him.  I pick him away,  I'll tell you.  He's a fine man.  He never looks for trouble.  He does the best he can.  And to live under the name of a Frank Jr.  See,  my father's only a bricklayer.  Nobody give a fuck for me.  But they still said,  you know,  you don't lay brick into your father.  Well,  lay brick into your fucking father.  What's your business?  But that's what we should never do.  Never be like your father. 
[03:37:30]  Be better.  Be better.  If your father's a gangster,  be a better gangster.  If your father shot 10 people,  shoot 20.  Always be better than your father.  You got a question,  John?  I don't know if Mr. Cooper  would go for this pool,  but I think XM needs an hour  of Pat Cooper  somewhere on high voltage.  Yeah,  we got to get you on this  satellite, man.  What?  Or at least get on our show  more often.  You're getting satellite?  No,  we're on XM right now  and everyone's saying  you're killing.  I'm sad.  What is your fucking problem?  How are we saying 
[03:38:00]  we're going to go on satellite?  I don't know what I'm going to do.  We ought to bring him  on as a regular.  You got to come up  with fucking money,  you sick fuck.  Give up something,  you sick bastard.  Let's go to Mike and Philly.  That's the bottom line.  Am I right?  What am I,  working for nothing?  No.  This is a throwaway.  I need to do my heavy stuff.  Mike and Philly,  what's up?  Hey,  I am absolutely honored  to have a chance  to talk with the great  Pat Cooper.  You guys just stole my thunder.  An extra,  I paid extra  five bucks a month 
[03:38:30]  to have Pat Cooper  on 202.  It's the best.  It's an honor.  I'll shut up and listen.  You're the greatest.  All right,  thank you.  Let's go to South Carolina.  Mike,  what's going on,  man?  Oh,  listen guys,  you got to replace Patrice  with this guy.  He is fantastic.  Love you,  Pat.  You're awesome.  We're going to have to pay him now.  The love for Pat.  We might have to pay him.  You're going to pay me.  Fuck you.  You're going to pay me.  I know.  Buy me a car,  something,  find the fucking place.  Just bring him in.  He's awesome.  Love you guys.  All right.  Thank you,  buddy.  You're very nice. 
[03:39:00]  Thanks,  man.  Well,  we got to get,  are you playing New York still?  I got to play New York.  God forbid you should fly me in  from the fucking Yucatan.  Fucking God forbid.  Well,  fuck you.  Right away,  you're not going to cut down the price,  you sheep.  I'm figuring we'll sell out a few shows for you.  That's all.  Hey,  listen to me.  I respect you and all that.  I don't need you to sell out my cock.  You hear me?  I don't need you.  I didn't come on here to sell out cock.  I'll sell out without you.  You understand?  I sell out to deaf people.  I sell out to deaf people. 
[03:39:30]  You hear me?  I'm doing a deaf convention.  You understand?  For the potato growers in fucking Idaho.  So cut the shit.  I don't need your fucking bullshit here.  You don't need me.  After 30s,  you're going to become a fucking bore.  Where do you go after this greatness?  You're going to go fucking downhill.  What are you going to bring on?  Who are you going to bring on next?  A guy that talks with a lisp?  Well,  we have him.  Yeah,  he talks with a lot.  It's right there,  Rich Voss.  Oh,  man,  Pac Cooper.  Well,  you've been going for an hour.  We really should take a break.  Yeah,  you should do something. 
[03:40:00]  Take a clutch,  soon become a car.  Goddamn,  Pat.  Fantastic.  Look what Howard Stern lost.  And he lost Jack Motley,  who's a fucking great gentleman.  One of the nicest fucking guys on the planet.  And you don't want to pay the guy.  Give him another $100,000,  you cheap fuck.  He was there.  $90 billion.  He was there when they built that show from nothing.  Now,  this is to tell Howard Stern,  don't want nobody  unless you're under his foot.  That's why people got  hoof and mouth disease.  Because they're under his fucking foot. 
[03:40:30]  Fuck all of them.  If they can't take it,  stand up to the man.  This kid.  Howard,  who the fuck are you  to abuse me,  you full of shit?  Fuck you and your money  and whatever you stand for.  And if you open your fucking mouth,  I'll break your fucking head.  How does that grab you,  Howard?  But you know something?  They're all pussies.  They're a guest man.  If Howard Stern dies tomorrow,  these kids will be afraid  to walk the street  because people spit at them.  Remember,  they did it for money.  I don't do nothing  for fucking money.  I'm doing this shit for nothing.  I'm a genius. 
[03:41:00]  I'm throwing this shit away  for nothing.  Where do you pay me?  I won't say a fucking word.  Ben,  best guest ever or what?  Ben loved it, Pat.  That's unbelievable.  See?  He's our boy, Gary.  Look,  he's a nice guy.  He's your boy.  What do you want?  That's not terrible,  what you say.  I always watch out  when guys with blonde hair.  Ben,  what time do you get off the air here?  I don't know.  It's like whenever we want.  Whenever we want.  Yes.  You get to stay.  When do these guys talk?  I don't know. 
[03:41:30]  You can't follow that.  No.  We're not dumb.  We're not going to do that.  No.  Pat.  Let me tell you something.  I know you can follow him.  Let me tell you something.  No one can follow you today.  Just remember this.  No one can follow you.  I swear to you.  I'd follow anybody.  That's why we're in the business  because we're fucking special.  Hey,  they can hear Sinatra sing  the same songs for 70 years.  You do the same story twice.  We're fucking geniuses.  We're the fucking geniuses.  Don't ever put your craft down.  Anybody say,  fuck you.  When you can do what I do,  let me see. 
[03:42:00]  He don't put his craft down.  He lets his audience do that.  Excuse me.  Did you interrupt me?  I'm on a fucking roll.  He did.  I didn't like it at all.  He did interrupt you.  It was rude.  I don't know.  I know these two guys.  I know these two guys.  I see them work.  I know what they can do.  I mean,  we are special.  No one's following you today,  though.  It's not a question of following me.  I happen to be,  look,  that's minor to know  the guy's on a roll,  back off.  If he's on a roll,  I back off.  That was the problem  with Howard's show.  He wouldn't let anyone else  be the star on that show.  Oh,  I was the fucking star on that show.  No,  you did better than most, 
[03:42:30]  but I mean,  if anyone started getting  more attention than Howard,  that was his biggest  fucking problem.  Well,  that's okay.  He had to ring the people in  and make sure he got  the last blast of stuff.  He's not a fucking happy man.  I didn't say he was happy.  I'm bringing the point  that when his wife left him,  that came another circumcision  he never expected  because that's fucking  killed his fucking ego  or those were  the gorgeous girl  and I will tell you the truth.  And again,  I don't hate the man  or dislike the man,  but he's got to grow up  and understand  there's enough for everybody.  I mean,  God forbid something  happens here,  send your wife,  hey boys,  God bless you,  I wish you well, 
[03:43:00]  you know,  you're doing a great.  Competition breeds money.  Competition breeds money.  Yeah.  Oh,  oh,  what are you doing?  Oh,  Eric,  what are you doing  when Pat's talking?  Pat's talking  and you're showing notes  to me?  How about some respect?  Your respect,  Pat.  Oh,  let me bring out  another point.  You're finished  with this shit?  All done.  All right.  Caroline,  Caroline,  are you listening?  Uh-oh.  Listen to me,  Caroline,  you tell those  fucking assholes  that work for you,  don't they ever call me  they want me  just on a Monday. 
[03:43:30]  Fuck them.  Joy Behar works  a Friday and Saturday  she can't draw  if I draw my ass  and you want me  on a fucking Monday  to take the door.  You tell those assholes  to talk with comics  with respect.  Not to talk to your  fucking friends,  Caroline.  You ought to be ashamed  of yourself.  You tell them,  don't call me  no fucker.  I don't need  your goddamn place.  I got to work  on a street corner  with no fucking lights  or nothing  and be a hit.  But you turn around  and call me,  we'll want you  on a Monday,  Mr. Cooper.  This fucking 12-year-old  sick bats are calling me.  Tell him to go  fuck himself.  Hey, I'll take the Monday.  Caroline,  I'll take the Monday. 
[03:44:00]  I'll take the Monday.  That pisses me off  they call me on a Monday.  Joy Behar,  nice lady.  Joy's nice.  She's not that fucking funny.  Joy, you're full of shit  from an old movie  but that's beside the point.  You're not that funny  but she's on the fucking view.  She's on the view.  I'm on up in Anthony  which is stronger  than a fucking view  and I'm going to  end up working on a barge.  I understand, Caroline.  Bullshit.  Hey, Anthony's stepdad  is on the line.  Sal wants to say hi  to Pat Cooper.  Sal.  Yeah.  Hey, Sal.  You're on with Pat Cooper.  Hey, Pat,  I got to tell you. 
[03:44:30]  Hey, Pat,  from one old fart  to another old fart,  you're the greatest.  Even the St. Anthony  the statue  I've been listening  for 60-some years.  You're the best.  He loves you, Pat.  Thank you, buddy.  I appreciate it.  Very kind.  You have a nice feast.  I know it's two weeks late  but after all, hey,  we still got to lay an egg.  At our age,  we forget.  God bless.  Two weeks ago.  Take it easy, Sal.  I'll call you.  Okay, thanks.  Did you ever work  with Lenny Bruce?  You worked with him?  So I'm at the Atlantic City. 
[03:45:00]  I was a kid, man.  What a genius.  I mean, you talk about  a flow,  snapping the fingers  and saying things like this.  Did I hear right?  Did I hear right?  Eight people in the room.  Eight people.  The Orchid Room.  Eight people in the room.  And I'm looking at this guy  and I was a kid.  I was, you know,  I went online to see the comics,  Fat Jackie Minute,  the Paramount,  and I went down there  with a couple of guys  and I said,  when this guy said  the four-letter word,  I mean, everybody,  nobody let me froze  because it was like a shock.  But the flow, 
[03:45:30]  forget the words,  the snap,  the flow,  the beat,  it was like watching an artist.  And the guy went on,  he went on Ed Sullivan,  but it wasn't,  he couldn't,  you're tying his tongue.  This is why I admired  Richard Pryor.  He said,  if you don't want me  in my way,  fuck you.  Because Richard opened  a lot of doors.  I was never,  I couldn't say,  and Ed Sullivan,  I couldn't say damn.  You said damn Yankees,  you had to say darn Yankees.  It's not darn Yankees,  it's fucking damn Yankees,  but Ed Sullivan fired you.  You couldn't say pregnant,  you had to say expecting.  So these guys broke down barriers. 
[03:46:00]  Not only that,  they broke down barriers,  they were funny.  But I got news here,  if he was alive today,  come in and now,  he'd be nothing.  He would be Lenny Bruce Minichos,  you know why?  That's all been said already.  So Richard Pryor said,  you know,  I did a roast,  we roasted Richard Pryor,  it's another thing,  I do the roast,  because I go on last.  Why?  Because they want to see  the Italian fucking die.  I never fucking die.  I fuck him where they breed.  We're roasting Richard Pryor.  I get up.  Everybody said anything  about Richard Pryor.  Now I'm the last.  I get up,  I say Richard,  do me a favor,  why the fuck would you die? 
[03:46:30]  That's my open fucking line.  I said,  you're breaking your eyeballs,  you're burning yourself,  you stick stuff up your ass,  you stick stuff up your,  do me a favor,  die now,  you'll be the biggest fucking comic  in the world.  Let me see you fucking die.  The place couldn't stop laughing.  I said,  you hear me?  Will you fucking die?  Italians,  we fought and we died.  That's it.  You had to make a fucking epic.  Fifteen minutes  of telling this guy  to fucking die.  And they screamed.  Because you know,  they know where it's coming from.  I mean,  when you do those fucking roasts,  man,  you know, 
[03:47:00]  he fucking crazy.  People go,  they always get the comment,  when you show no respect,  fuck you.  Fuck you again.  When you show no respect,  when you shouldn't say  you want him to die.  I want him to fucking die.  All right?  I want him to fucking die again,  you cocksucker.  Hope you fucking die with him.  You jealous prick.  I went on laughing,  I killed the fucking audience  of Barthesda.  You made prior laugh,  right?  I went on to laugh.  We did,  we did Don King.  I said,  Don,  Don,  we all come from monkeys  and gorillas.  But unfortunately, 
[03:47:30]  you got there too early.  What a,  not a comment,  you should say it  about the black people.  Fuck you and the black people.  How dare,  it's a joke,  you stupid bastard.  But,  no,  jealous.  Hey,  Ben,  grab that mic really fast.  Yes.  We got to bring in  Michael Strahan  for a little second.  Yeah,  are you a football fan,  Pat?  I don't like the ball,  I don't like the foot.  Michael,  get in there,  hurry up.  Here comes the lull  in the station.  Hey, 
[03:48:00]  Michael Strahan.  Yeah.  What's up,  Michael?  Hey,  not much,  man,  we're not on air,  are we?  Good job.  Yeah,  actually,  we are on the air.  This is what we do,  we just screw around  for a few hours.  All right,  that's Pat Cooper.  Michael,  how are you?  He doesn't like the foot  or the ball,  but,  I got a football  with his name on it  faded.  It may be fake accent.  Now it says,  I swear to you,  Mike,  I don't know  how the fuck  you're right.  Don't you know  how the fuck  I got it.  I got Joe DiMaggio.  Give me five balls 
[03:48:30]  of a stupid pep.  Because in those  fucking days,  I didn't have  the right ink  to stay.  I got,  I got Sinatra  to my pep,  pep.  I said,  fuck you  and football,  Mike.  How's that fucking  good?  Fucking football.  What did I  walk into,  man?  And he make us  laugh.  Fuck him  and his football.  Give him the ball.  Give him your ass.  I don't trust  that fucking guy.  Give me a favor,  quick.  Fucker,  San Diego needs you. 
[03:49:00]  Eli wouldn't go,  I'm not going.  Do you want me to go?  No,  you don't have to go.  Mike,  sit down,  we'll joke in a session.  I'm afraid of you.  Stand down,  we'll talk to you.  We're actually,  take a break.  Yeah,  we're going to take  a break,  actually.  We just wanted you  to meet Michael Strahan  and Dr. E.  Smith here.  Wait,  wait,  why don't you say  hurry up,  Mike,  you're fucking boring.  Say something.  You're lucky  I can't talk  I don't want to talk,  man.  Come on,  tight.  Wait, 
[03:49:30]  what?  Pat,  what happened?  Oh,  hey,  come here,  here.  He's got tattoos  on his arm.  He reads himself  that night.  Hello,  ma.  Hello,  Anthony.  Hello,  Terry.  Take that shit  off,  you're out.  You said,  fuck.  Mike,  so far,  you haven't said shit.  I walked into a firestorm  after.  Holy shit,  Pat.  Look at this fucking load.  Eight seconds you hear,  the fucking show's over.  I can honestly say  I'm never left  harder on this show.  You know something?  I got news here.  Yeah.  To be a great fucking athlete,  not him, 
[03:50:00]  but just to be a great athlete,  it's such a great thing  to walk down the street  and they say,  you know something?  You rat,  that's how you dropped  the fucking ball.  What is your fucking problem,  Sam?  The hammer,  the hammer,  the hammer.  And he said,  I never drop the fucking ball,  you little bastard.  Yeah.  Nobody drops the ball  when I get the ball.  I'm with the Giants.  I would quit  if I were you  a little fucking shaky  last year.  I was shaky.  Listen to me,  hiccup fucking baseball. 
[03:50:30]  I would if I could,  they'd play longer  and make more money.  It's not the fucking money,  you're going to die  with your fucking money.  Just be a great guy,  be a great athlete.  Grab a couple of bras,  get a side order  and they run out of town,  that's all.  You're a fucking stud,  that's all.  I catch a football  and they thought  I was a fucking gay guy  in my day.  When you played tennis,  they thought you were gay,  now you're a fucking athlete.  Hit that fucking ball.  Hit that ball.  Hit that ball.  Bullshit.  Fuck the ball.  Fuck all the balls. 
[03:51:00]  Fuck Bobby Bonds  and his fucking back.  Fuck all you athletes.  Step outside,  strandahana,  handahana.  Nothing's all in your ass.  I gotta go.  Thank you for everyone.  Thank you.  I found my Cooper today.  Oh, to my doctor  and I'm having  a nervous breakdown.  God bless, man.  You too, man.  Sorry about your wife.  You'll have more time.  I don't even know you,  but sorry about your wife.  You got a fucking year,  now you say it.  What the fuck is your problem?  How do you do?  You hump every seven days,  nine days,  what the fuck's the difference?  I appreciate it. 
[03:51:30]  I'm serious.  Put down your fucking hair.  I lost my pop, so.  You didn't have a good year.  All right.  Thank you.  Take a break?  Yeah, we really should  take a break.  Dr. Ian Smith's here  from Celebrity Fit Club  and, of course,  Michael Strahan  from the New York Giants.  Absolutely.  Wow.  We got to step aside  for a few.  We'll be back.  Bobby and Anthony  have returned  to CBS Radio.  And the listeners  couldn't be happier.  You guys are doing  the Howard Stern show, man.  Who are you kidding?  There's about a thousand stations  doing the same exact show.  Josh, that's right, Josh. 
[03:52:00]  You can do whatever you want.  You're just going to fail  because you're sussed  because you're just repeating  what everybody else does.  By the way,  I was listening to your show  in the beginning  when you were making fun of  I'm just hanging out  in the village  with this pink cowboy hat  and the whole deal.  I like this guy.  By the way,  Sirius just offered him a show.  They're paying him  $10 million.  El programa  de Opie and Anthony.  También Jim Norton.  No se le olvide de Jim.  That means  don't forget about Jim.  California  We bow to Pat Cooper today. 
[03:52:30]  That was one of the best hours of radio.  Unbelievable.  He's out of control, man.  Who's on the phone?  I don't know.  Someone called during the show. 
[03:53:00]  It was another one of those  somebody hitting me on autodial  and then you just hear  talking in the background.  I love that.  I got you.  You called me once like that.  What did I do?  I picked up the phone.  I saw Opie.  So I hit and I listen  and I just hear you talking.  Like so you autodial me  and then you're afraid  to like listen too long.  Yeah, you never know  what they're going to say.  Fucking Anthony.  What a dick.  You know, so.  I don't know. 
[03:53:30]  I don't even know  how we continue  after Pat Cooper.  That was just amazing.  And I got to tell you, man,  I think I have balls  as far as confronting people  and saying stuff.  Man, he went after Michael.  You guys have never met, right?  No one.  If I meet him in the street,  I'm going to kick his old ass.  I'll be honest with you.  I didn't want to do anything in here.  I was quiet.  But he better watch out.  I'll kick his old ass.  You never know  how someone's going to take that.  Pat Cooper just attacked  Michael Strahan.  Hey, the dude is crazy.  I walk, he's talking. 
[03:54:00]  You're not saying anything.  You won't let me get anything in.  What do you say at that point?  Exactly.  And then he slams the mic down.  He's like, I'm out of here.  He even knows when to leave.  It was like Vegas.  Thank you.  Good night.  It was a perfect appearance  on this radio show.  Yeah.  Pat Cooper killed.  Oh, is he funny, man?  What a lunatic.  And boy, talk about open and honest.  That guy will bash people.  By the way, some good news.  Tomorrow, when we're doing our show  on regular radio, 
[03:54:30]  and they go to those long commercial breaks,  we're going to replay the Pat Cooper stuff.  Oh, cool.  In segments.  We're just going to play  the whole freaking thing tomorrow.  Good.  All right, just in case you missed  a part of that or whatever.  It's unbelievable.  Actually, I mean,  we got the replays later today.  If you're just tuning in,  make sure you check out Pat Cooper.  He did an hour and ten minutes,  and we just basically watched him.  He performed at John Gotti's wedding.  Yeah, it was amazing,  the store she has.  You know, it's just great.  It's funny, dude, man.  He's 77.  You could do comedy forever.  You know, just think. 
[03:55:00]  I mean, he's 77.  He's complaining, too,  about the shit we complain about now.  Like, fuck that club.  They won't hire me.  Fuck them.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, shit was going on  back in the 20s.  But it doesn't stop.  He's 77.  Vaudeville bringing out  his big steamer trunk on stage.  Do you think he's burnt any bridges?  Holy fuck.  Fuck you, Sinatra.  Whoa.  Yeah.  When you have fucked Sinatra.  I told Sam Giancana.  Holy shit.  Oh, Jesus.  He's only even talking about  people who are dead,  so he's all right.  You don't come to New York 
[03:55:30]  and talk to Caroline that way.  What's wrong with him?  Also in studio,  Dr. Ian Smith,  one of our new friends.  Celebrity Fit Club  has started filming, right?  Oh, boy.  It's going to be  the best season ever.  Yeah?  The absolute best.  What's the lineup now?  We got this guy that is...  What, your fat celebrity?  Well, you guys have been  friends for what,  a long time?  A long time, yeah.  This is my guy.  Michael, you laugh at him  now that he's this big  Hollywood star on VH1?  You know,  I like that part where...  He used to be  the serious doctor 
[03:56:00]  on the local news  here in New York.  Opie, step onto the scale, please.  Right, right.  That's my favorite part  of the show, man.  Every time I see it,  I'm like,  he's such a...  Well, man.  But anyway, doc,  I'm sorry, go ahead, man.  Come on to the show.  No, he knows.  See, straight knows.  Straight knows me  from way back,  so he knows that  I did the show,  I said no at first,  then decided to do it.  And it's funny  because we'll go out,  the two of us,  first of all,  everyone mobs him.  Right.  No doubt about it.  But once every hundred people,  they'll recognize me  before him  and he thinks  they're coming to him,  they're coming to me.  That's a lie. 
[03:56:30]  What are you lying for?  Why are you lying like that?  Most people come to you,  be honest.  No, I'm not saying  that they don't,  but people come to you,  you know,  everybody,  and people know  that they're all fat people.  Mostly,  but you know,  who's complaining,  they're people.  Or with dentures,  but 1% come to me  and when that 1% comes,  I'm always waiting for it too.  I'm like,  yeah,  I still got a little action.  But we're good friends.  Are you sick of everyone  coming up to you  and asking you  eating advice and all that  and how to diet?  The first time he came in, 
[03:57:00]  we all rushed him  after the show.  Look,  this is what I'm doing wrong  and everybody had questions for you  and I imagine  that's what's going on  all the time now.  Here's the worst thing.  When I'm in the airport  and I'm eating,  people come and say,  I'm watching what you're eating.  I'm like,  oh, great.  Don't you have something  better to do?  No.  I mean,  just be regular.  People don't want to eat  things around me.  You saw me.  We went out the other day.  What did I have?  I don't remember now.  Piece of cake.  Piece of cake from Starbucks.  That's right.  We were at Starbucks.  I had a piece of cake the other day.  I had to go over my journal.  You're keeping a journal?  I did a food journal. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, he did.  He did it for a week.  He did it for a week.  Dear Broccoli.  What do you eat?  I got a food fucking journal.  Dude,  we've got very long hours now  and I think if I eat better,  I'll have more energy  and I can get through this  the damn thing.  You can write down  everything you eat?  Yeah, for like two weeks.  See, Anthony's completely different.  He has, what do you have?  Like a bagel and club stove.  A bagel and club stove in the morning.  And that's it for the whole day.  Until he goes home.  When I go home,  I'll have some, you know.  I have to eat the entire time  I'm on the air.  First of all,  every half hour. 
[03:58:00]  Look at him.  He's about the size of a skeleton.  He's hypermetabolic.  Your metabolism is like...  Hold on, hold on.  Hyper what?  Slow that down for some people.  Oh boy, here we go.  Hypermetabolic.  It means his metabolism  is like going like a race car.  I know what it means, Doc.  I barely,  I don't eat that much either.  And it's usually just,  you know,  chicken,  broccoli,  things like that.  Well, I think  what you're used  to not really eating a lot,  you really don't.  I mean...  Yeah, but that's bad though.  That's like starving yourself.  You can't not eat.  That's the whole point.  People think,  well, you know,  if I starve myself  and fast for a week, 
[03:58:30]  I'm going to lose weight.  No, you're not.  The Fat Smash Diet.  And it was on  the New York Times  bestseller list.  It's on the list right now  this Sunday.  Congratulations.  Listen, Opie,  one of your guys  emailed me  from your message board  and said I was cheap  because I come in here  all the time  and don't give away free books.  So I brought free copies.  I don't know how you guys  give stuff to you,  but I brought free copies  from people.  I see you brought a lot too.  How many of that?  Hey, hold on.  What is it?  Four books?  So, um...  Here, you take,  Opie,  you take one.  I'll take one. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, they're all gone.  No more free books.  Oh, Ian, please.  Next time,  bring a few more.  Dr. Ian Smithowitz.  He did make me  drive the paper parkies.  Oh, boy.  I come here in good faith.  I came here  to congratulate you guys  on your big deal.  Congratulations, gentlemen.  And then you guys  are just slamming me  this morning.  What's up with that?  We got to bring...  All right,  we won't slam you anymore.  We got a guy  that's doing  the Fat Smash Diet  around here.  And he's lost,  how many pounds  did Nathaniel Lewis again? 
[03:59:30]  I don't know.  Look at this.  Look at this,  Dr. Ian.  Whoa.  Hi.  Hi.  Whoa.  Do you remember  how he looked  only a couple weeks ago?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's tall, yeah.  I didn't know  you were going to go  on the program.  Yeah, it was a  spur-of-the-moment thing.  How'd the detox go?  Uh, it wasn't too bad.  It wasn't as brutal.  First few days are tough, right?  Yeah.  And then you get used to it.  Yeah, then it's just  the weekend is tough, too,  when you fall out  of a routine  because I can just  have whatever I want.  So how much  did you lose?  15 pounds in nine days.  In how long?  In nine days? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  Doing what?  Wow.  Exercising and doing  the fat smash diet  for phase one.  Nathaniel's very,  very uncomfortable  because there's  a bunch of guys  just staring.  You're talking about  something sexy  like dieting.  Right, yeah.  Just men.  And then we got  Jim Norton  who's eventually  going on the  fat smash diet.  He attempted  to get on the diet  on four days in a row.  And then they  brought cake in  for his birthday  so I shoved  three pieces  into my fat face.  He had three  different desserts  during the morning  show yesterday alone. 
[04:00:30]  Jimmy's got no  self-control  is what it is.  There were three  different cakes  and he got to have  a piece of each one.  I had to.  So I'm trying  to start it today.  I had egg whites.  Good.  I actually did have  dry wheat toast today.  I had dry wheat toast  you're not supposed to have.  All right, all right.  That's not bad.  That's not going to kill you.  And I had two bananas  and a smoothie  with skim milk.  What time is it, though?  It's only 9 to 11 o'clock.  Yeah, I know, right?  We thought it was 6, though.  We're at the station  at 5 in the morning, so.  While you're...  Ooh. 
[04:01:00]  While I'm what?  I forget it.  What, what?  I'm sleeping at 5 in the morning.  What?  Oh, okay.  On occasion.  He started something.  Well, I was just going to say,  I mean, 5 o'clock for us,  you know, we're working  at 5 o'clock  or going to work.  5 o'clock for a star like this,  I mean, you know,  the night is...  You know what?  Let's cut this whole star crap out.  Let me tell you what, my friend.  By 7, I am up  working out in that gym.  Nobody's life is easy.  I mean, I wish I could just  tell fat people  how to lose weight. 
[04:01:30]  You know what?  I really, as a joke,  I don't mean to offend  any of the fat people out there.  Not fat, overweight.  People are a little obese.  I was there once.  My brothers used to call me Bob.  It meant booty on back.  I had a big ass.  And that's why  I started working out.  So I really, I sympathize with you.  And, you know,  if I ever need it,  I'm going to try this diet, man.  Right now, I'm good, though.  But 15 pounds,  my man lost.  Nine days.  I didn't see him before,  but he looks pretty good.  So why is this  Celebrity Fit Club  going to be good?  You seem really excited 
[04:02:00]  about the people  that are doing it.  First of all,  this is the biggest guy  I've ever seen on the show.  He's 6'4", 4'30".  Whoa.  And he walks through the door  and you're like,  Who is it?  Bone Crusher.  Who's Bone Crusher?  He's a big rapper.  Big, huge rapper.  He's got wild hair.  I mean, if you see him,  I mean, he's very recognizable,  obviously.  But he's athletic.  The guy, like, plays basketball.  Like, he's athletic.  He can run.  I'm like, dude,  Really?  How can you be 4'30  and you're, like,  running around?  So he's great.  But you know who's awesome?  Big Pussy from The Sopranos. 
[04:02:30]  Vinny Pistori?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That guy is real  New York, Italian,  you know.  He's like,  Doctor, come on.  I've got to lose the weight.  You know.  But it's going to be good.  We've got a lot of action.  What about the Baywatch, babe?  How brutal does she look now?  Be honest.  Well, here's the problem.  You took care of Kelly LeBrock  and got her sexy again.  You know, here's the problem.  I've got to be honest with you.  When you go online  and you Google her,  you're seeing her  from her heyday of Baywatch.  Right.  And you're like, whoa.  What's her name again? 
[04:03:00]  Erica Eleniak.  Yeah, so people  could play along at home.  Eleniak.  E-L-E-N-A-K.  You'll remember her.  She was the Pam Anderson  before Pam Anderson  on Baywatch.  Exactly.  But, you know,  she's had a kid.  She's married, you know.  Here's my prediction, though.  She's going to be  the new Kelly LeBrock.  You're right.  When she finishes this show,  her body is going to be killer.  She's not that...  She's about 20 pounds overweight,  25 pounds.  How bad does she look?  Why is it, though,  when people say,  well, she had a baby,  which I understand,  but she's married.  Like, when you get married,  just let yourself go.  You let yourself go.  That's it.  Like, I got somebody now.  But, Norton's never been married, 
[04:03:30]  so that doesn't go that way.  That's why there's prostitution.  Look, I don't need to be in shape.  I don't think I'm...  Here's 300.  300 bucks equals workout regimen.  Cup of Jell-O.  How much did Kelly LeBrock lose altogether?  31 pounds in 100 days.  She looks good.  31 pounds.  For someone like that's 400 and something pounds,  31 pounds is not going to put a dent in it.  No.  We're going to try to get...  You know, our goal for the show, 
[04:04:00]  for this guy,  it's only 100 days.  I'm putting on my diet.  Our goal is to get 50 pounds off of him.  And the guy's going to die  if he doesn't lose weight.  I'm telling you.  But he liked to take his shirt off  in concert, too.  Wait till you guys see it.  Really?  Yeah.  And you got...  Who do you got?  One of the Wilson girls, right?  Carney Wilson.  Carney Wilson's on it.  She's back.  You know, she had the gastric bypass  seven years ago.  And she ate her way through that, right?  Well, she had a kid...  Ate her way through it.  You sound like a trapped rat.  He knows, though.  She's got to eat her way through.  That's why I love this show.  That's why I love this show.  You still got to eat, right?  Yeah. 
[04:04:30]  Even though you get that done,  and she ate her way through it  and her stomach got big again, right?  Her downfall...  She'll admit it, by the way,  was snack.  She just can't stop snacking.  See, it's the mental...  Because I know a guy who had it,  and it's like the eating habit.  It's like if you're not dealing  with why you're eating...  Like, I quit drinking years ago,  and if I don't deal with my character flaws,  I'm going to start again.  It's not just about the substance.  You know, you can't...  If you don't deal with, like,  whatever fucking problems you have  that makes you such a fatso,  and that's exactly what it is... 
[04:05:00]  And his problem is on page eight  here in this gay magazine.  I mean, the thing is...  See, the gastro...  Now I'm on fire.  The thing is, that's a quick fix.  Yeah, just like Pat Cooper.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God.  Holy fuck, how funny.  Yeah, you're just on fire.  No, you really are.  But that's a quick fix,  and, like, addiction, too.  You can't...  There's no...  You know, there's no quick fix.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Well, that's the whole point, though.  Everyone thinks there's a quick fix.  And the idea is you have the surgery,  and then people just want to keep  eating cakes and stuff like that.  And you know what's going to happen.  You're going to gain the weight back. 
[04:05:30]  Now you're going to be miserable  because you've got the surgery that you can't undo.  And then when you eat a certain amount of foods,  bad stuff happens to you.  You guys can say it.  But...  You throw up, right?  The other way.  Oh, you shit.  Like crazy, yeah.  Well, you throw up,  it's just from the opposite end of your mouth.  But anyway, you're right.  There are no quick fixes,  which is why we try to put these guys  on a good program  to make them lose weight gradually.  But if you can snack, though,  but maybe she was just snacking on the wrong stuff.  You can snack, right?  Yeah, but you can't snack  on two bags of potato chips.  How about a few bananas?  Well, that's not a snack. 
[04:06:00]  How about pretzels?  You can have pretzels once in a while.  Yeah, pretzels, yeah.  A half a bag of pretzels,  but people go overboard.  You read the book, huh?  No, but I want to  because I really want to lose it.  Like, I've been exercising a lot  and I've lost some.  I mean, you guys...  Actually, he's lost a lot.  He did an HBO special or whatever.  A year ago.  Yeah, it was a year ago.  A year ago,  and he was a lot bigger.  Yeah, I was a fucking completely fat fuck.  So now I lost some  because I was so disgusted  with the way I looked on camera.  I'm going to quit smoking,  so I'm scared I'm going to gain a lot of weight.  He's not going to quit smoking.  He's not going to quit.  He really is a fucking slave to cigarettes.  You're not going to quit. 
[04:06:30]  Why wouldn't I?  He's a doctor, too.  Maybe he could help you out.  Are you serious?  You're a smoker?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How stupid is that these days?  How old are you?  What the hell is it?  48.  How long have you been smoking?  Oh, listen, I know the fucking...  I know it's bad.  Why don't you answer his question?  I'll just answer my questions.  Jesus.  Just answer the question.  Just answer my questions.  How...  17...  31 years.  How long have you been dressing  like you're in a barbershop quartet?  What are you talking...  I'm talking to him.  31 years.  And I met your wife.  Yeah.  She's a comedian, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give me her number,  because she and I will attend  your funeral together.  Oh, that's nice.  Uh-huh.  Here's the thing. 
[04:07:00]  I like that.  Uh-huh.  Stupid.  He's telling you.  He's a doctor.  He keeps making excuses  why he can't start.  No, I'm not making excuses.  You know...  You've given us start dates  for the last...  Who knows?  Years he's been giving them to me.  Years.  Years.  You know, if not for anything else  but what he just said,  to keep Bonnie away from a black guy.  I know.  Hey, I'm going to the funeral, too.  Two black guys.  Could go home,  Bonnie will have a carton of cigarettes for him. 
[04:07:30]  He's not going to leave me for a black guy.  He likes her electricity on.  That's a good one  if they're not two really rich guys.  Rich guys.  They're millionaires.  They're not looking for cars on eBay, my friend.  He bought...  Oh, sauerkraut shrunk.  What kind of car did you...  He bought a...  Was it a Rolls Royce?  Yeah.  Off eBay.  He bought a Rolls Royce on eBay.  I didn't buy it.  The deal fell through.  He tried to  and he lost his deposit  because he sent the guy money  before he even went down to Florida 
[04:08:00]  where the guy could have ripped them off.  He went for a test drive  and the whole car smelled like...  Sauerkraut.  Sauerkraut and sausage.  No, the car had molding.  The car smelled like a flood.  I go...  This car was in a flood.  He goes,  No, no.  It's a sauerkraut that he put in the back.  He put a box of sauerkraut.  To try to...  If someone put a box of sauerkraut  in the trunk,  they're trying to cover up a smell  that's worse than sauerkraut.  And you lost her money?  No, I finally got it back.  eBay, I got it back.  How much was it?  A thousand bucks.  But I got a thousand dollar deposit  down a car  that was in Florida. 
[04:08:30]  What year was the car?  It was...  Well, it was old.  It was an older Rolls Royce.  It looked really nice on eBay.  What year was it?  No, it didn't.  Stray's a car guy  so he knows all about cars.  Let's go.  It could have been like an 89  or something.  It was like for 25,000.  The year that Rolls...  The year that Rolls guys  make fun of.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  But any Rolls Royce  with 25,000,  at some point  you should have realized  that was a problem.  I'm being honest with you.  No, of course.  I don't know.  I never stole as many cars as you.  I'm just trying to say 
[04:09:00]  that, you know...  No one's laughing.  One bad one.  The blue book  was 42,000.  That was very hurtful.  That was mean spirited.  That was really mean spirited.  Oh, yeah.  I would apologize for that.  Dying in strangers  is nice spirited.  We wouldn't be strangers  after your funeral.  We'd be one big happy family.  Every rich benefit  she showed  but like Voss benefits  wearing a Giants hat and jersey.  I miss him so much. 
[04:09:30]  We're killing him.  I love this.  I love this show.  I'm telling you.  Dr. Ian Smith loves this.  So, you've got to stop smoking.  I am.  Monday, I'm stopping.  He's a doctor.  Yeah.  No, you should have  he just said Monday.  Monday.  Any Monday.  You know what?  You know what?  Let's do this.  Here's the deal.  Let's put a penalty phase in.  Millions of people  are listening to you.  What's your penalty  if you don't stop Monday  and keep to it for six months?  We'll do it by six month intervals.  I have to watch his act  two nights in a row.  No, I don't know.  What kind of penalty?  Yeah, Rich, 
[04:10:00]  we're trying to help you.  No need to be hurtful.  Let's make a penalty right now, guys.  Seriously.  What's his penalty  if he does not stick?  It's got to be  Monday you start  in six months.  We've gone six month plots.  You will never make it.  I would.  I got 20 years sober.  I got two years off gambling.  And no years off cigarettes.  Let's deal with one thing.  All right.  Right.  Stop thinking of all the things  you've done.  Jimmy.  You have 48 years without death.  So what?  What does that mean?  I stop Monday.  I'm stopping this Monday.  Okay, good.  Okay, here's the deal.  You ready?  Yeah.  You got a lot of money.  You're a comedian.  You're famous.  You won the last  comic standing, right? 
[04:10:30]  Yeah, a couple things.  Tough crowd.  Okay, here's the deal.  Nice plug.  Here's the deal.  A hundred dollars a cigarette.  What do you mean?  You contribute a hundred dollars  and we're going to have  a fund here.  He'll never be honest, though.  No, no, he's going to be.  No, no, look at the guy's face.  Come on.  I'm fucking honest.  That's what I'm saying.  He'll never be honest.  Look at his face.  A hundred dollars.  It's not.  You just said you're going to do it.  I am going to do it.  I'm going to quit.  That's the point, stupid.  That's the point we make today.  Oh, my God.  He's already buying it. 
[04:11:00]  All right.  So Monday.  A hundred dollars.  A hundred dollars.  A hundred dollars.  A hundred dollars.  Okay.  Besides the fact that I'm going to live  and quit smoking.  Goes to the American Cancer Society.  Then something.  Yeah, okay.  Then something.  When I get to six months  or three months,  got to be donated to a, you know.  How about you donate  some of the money you save  from cigarettes?  How much are they packed now?  They're a lot.  Like five bucks.  What are these things?  No, seven or eight dollars.  Yeah, seven or eight bucks.  No, no, no.  It's two.  I feel.  But whatever.  Whatever.  It's going to start Monday  and end Tuesday.  Okay, you'll see. 
[04:11:30]  We need bits.  We need something  that's going to last a few months.  Monday.  I'm stopping Monday.  I quit four years ago.  Four years?  Four years, man.  You know, I know you told the story a lot,  but he's a doctor.  He would appreciate the story.  What kind of doctor?  We had, back on NW,  we had a day called  What the Hell is That?  Where we had three doctors.  Real doctors.  And they were like,  we had listeners coming in  with all these little weird  skin tags and things.  A lot of people are scared  to go to the doctor.  So we said, come on in.  We have doctors here  and in a fun atmosphere,  they'll at least look at it 
[04:12:00]  and tell you if you should then  pursue and go to a doctor.  Some strange things came in.  Yeah.  But most of them,  actually all of them,  were just little nonsense.  Ah, that can be taken off.  That's nothing.  This is nothing.  One guy came in late.  Yeah.  And he had like a little  white bump in his mouth.  And he was a little like,  ah, what is that?  It's been bugging me.  And the doctors looked at it  and it was kind of like...  Cancer.  Well, they wouldn't say that,  but they were like,  you really need to get that checked.  And all the fun  drained out of the room.  Oof.  And they were like,  was one of the guys behind him 
[04:12:30]  making a seat  like it could be cancer?  And the one doctor  didn't want to touch it.  Like, no, no.  You just have to go  and get that looked at.  One guy tapped out.  He said,  I don't want to be part of this.  Yeah, I can't do it.  He's just got to go get this checked.  And so...  The one of the doctors?  Yeah.  Wow.  Tapped out.  He was like, whoa.  Because it wasn't an official diagnosis.  You know,  they're all packed on lawsuits.  So the guy started panicking  and the guy was trying to...  He was like,  all right, what do I need to do?  Who do I need to see?  Do I need to get this checked out?  Do you think I should go...  It was watching this guy  try to hold on to his sanity.  It was like,  that is what it looks like  when you find out  you have mouth cancer.  That's the reaction. 
[04:13:00]  It was like a weird window  into watching somebody find that out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Him panicking  but trying not to panic  was what...  I'm like, enough.  So I'm like, I got to quit.  I'm going to finish this pack.  And he screamed at me.  He's like,  just fucking throw the pack out.  So I had one more.  So I'm going to have one more.  And then I went on the patch  and that was it.  That was it?  I had one more cigarette.  Four years ago.  What?  Yeah, it was December of 2001.  Cold turkey.  Well, can I do the patch?  Yeah, you should do the patch.  God bless.  SD from the Comedy Cellar  who's like...  She's like a hardcore  Israeli smoker for 30 years.  I quit with the patch  and she took me... 
[04:13:30]  The minute I got down to the cellar  she took me and got the patch.  It's like, do it and do it.  I don't even know  why I used the patch.  Just quit.  Why?  Why?  It's hard for 31 years.  Yes.  You may need a little bit.  Didn't you use the patch once  and you were smoking with it?  No, no.  I quit for six months  a couple years ago.  Five or six years ago.  I quit for six months.  But I didn't want to quit  more than I wanted to smoke  and I started again.  Why not use the patch?  The patch, it's like an ego.  We're like,  I should be able to do it myself  but the patch is like a 10-week program.  I did it in completion  as it said to do it. 
[04:14:00]  Like normally I would just go  I'm quitting Monday.  It sucks.  You got kids?  You got kids?  Yeah, two daughters.  Let me tell you real fast.  Listen, hold on.  Hold on, let the doctor talk.  All right, go ahead.  My mother,  okay, so I have a twin brother.  My father divorced my mother  when I was a kid.  I didn't have a dad.  So my mother was a smoker.  We couldn't stand smoking.  It was just the smell of it.  Not for health reasons.  We were kids.  And we used to always say  stop smoking,  stop smoking,  stop smoking.  One day she came home  and she wasn't smoking.  We're like,  whoa. 
[04:14:30]  My brother and I  were like nudging each other.  What happened?  Next day,  no smokes.  So finally we're like,  Ma, you okay?  She saw a movie at work  where some mother  and her two sons,  the mother died of cancer.  It was one of those  kind of discouraging,  this is old school,  and they showed the two kids  going crazy,  you know,  in grief  at the funeral of the mother  and she stopped cold turkey  because she said,  I don't want my boys  to have to go through that.  So what's up with you, man? 
[04:15:00]  Your kids,  what's up with that?  You want your kids  to bury you like that  over something like that?  Especially since you've  accomplished nothing  and they have no inheritance.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm about to start crying  right here.  He's pissing me off.  Now,  you're pissing me off.  You don't have any bad habits.  You're saying  in your whole life  you've had no bad habits.  Of course I have bad habits.  Okay,  so I'm addicted to something.  Not habits to kill me  and to hurt other people.  My habits are  I like to go out  and buy a nice coat  every once in a while.  I like to buy a nice watch  every once in a while.  This man drank cranberry juice. 
[04:15:30]  I drank cranberry juice.  All right,  so you're perfect  but here's the deal.  I'm not perfect.  I have an addictive personality  so I've done  certain things in my life  I've accomplished quitting.  Okay,  I'm addicted to smoking.  I'm not in denial.  All right,  I have to stop smoking.  Okay.  I got 20 years sober  so I know about addiction.  I got two years  off of gambling  so you know.  Okay.  You know.  All right,  that's fair.  That's fair.  I'm an understanding guy.  That's fair.  All right,  let's go to the phones. 
[04:16:00]  You know what you should have said  when he said that?  You should have said whoopty fucking bitch.  Perry Winkle from Whackbag.  We got Michael Strahan in studio as well.  We should talk a little football  before we get out of here.  Oh.  Perry Winkle.  Wow.  Hey guys,  let Dr. Eden Smith  check out Voss's ear.  Yeah.  What's the deal?  I got skin cancer  but I got to go to the doctor for that.  No,  the other thing.  Oh,  that's just everybody get those.  Everybody.  You're willing to take one for the team today? 
[04:16:30]  No,  no,  no,  no.  I like these guys.  I wouldn't do it to them.  No.  Why?  What he does is  he rubs behind his ear  and there's some type of  like ancient cyst thing.  Strahan would like it.  And then he makes people smell it  and it just smells like  decomposing garbage.  Oh,  it smells like blueberry.  You should try it.  You would like it.  You're a football player.  You can handle it.  What the hell  does that guy have to do with this?  Oh,  you're smelling your fucking smell.  You're a fucking man.  I'm the smell of stankin' man.  Football player.  He'll do anything. 
[04:17:00]  Yeah,  big old dumb football player.  Dumb football player.  I didn't say,  I said you can handle it.  You're tough.  You know,  it just,  it smells like blueberries  and strawberries.  I have an idea.  How about this?  Michael smells it  and if he doesn't like it  because he's tough,  you're tough  and you have to handle  his fist in your jaw.  Then he won't be able to smoke.  That's the answer.  That's the answer.  Hey,  have you rubbed that recently?  No,  I probably have a lot.  Do we have any interns here today? 
[04:17:30]  Have you ever smelled,  all right.  It's actually not bad.  It's more like grape jelly  and it's annoying  that it smells like grape jelly.  Let me set this up.  We once did this  in a train station parking lot.  There was a bunch of us,  a bunch of comedians  and stuff.  And I dry heaved  and two other guys puked.  It's that bad.  It's unbelievable.  Because it's a jelly,  here's the problem.  It's got a grape jelly vibe to it  so it's not really gross  in itself  but you just know  where it came from.  It's like,  why does it smell like jelly?  It shouldn't smell like jelly.  It's not in itself  a bad odor. 
[04:18:00]  But the concept...  I'm staring at him, man.  He has some issues over there.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What kind of...  All right.  Hold on.  What's your name again?  Just flip the ear,  John.  I want to see it.  All right.  Get John a microphone.  Man, look at him.  Look at...  I thought kids didn't...  I thought kids didn't  put that kind of moose or gel.  This guy's hair is...  Holy cow.  I thought that was out of style  like ten years ago.  Uh-huh.  Dr. Smith is giving you  a good beating.  What do you have to say?  I have nothing to say.  I'm embarrassed to know.  He's the guy...  He's the guy we think  looks like a grown-up child star. 
[04:18:30]  That mic's still not on.  Turn the mic on, please.  I'm going over here  because the scent seems to waft.  It's a stupid grape jelly smell.  Oh, I might have some.  All right.  Well, smell it first.  Watch this.  This is the real deal.  You know when you smell it yourself  and it's from you  and it makes you sick? 
[04:19:00]  Don't even think about it.  Don't even think about it.  Just fuck away from me.  I'll shoot you.  John, what does that smell like?  This is like a fucking  rotting cabbage.  No.  Take one more.  Don't be a silly goose.  It's...  Wait, give him...  Give Dr. Ian Smith the mic back.  That is the real deal. 
[04:19:30]  Why don't you smell it, Doc?  Doc, I think you need to smell it  to make a prognosis.  Listen, everyone settle down.  I have to get my doctor voice on.  Everyone settle down.  It's antibacterial.  Come on, dude.  Cut the cyst out.  What are you doing?  I just had...  Can you rub it on your finger, please?  Back out.  Drain it.  No, I had to drain.  It's not...  The cyst isn't still there.  Well, what's smelling?  This was there years ago.  I don't...  You're the doctor?  No, I'm not a dermatologist.  I'm not a funk doctor either.  It's not a stink.  It's a stink.  Do you have any more  because we have another victim? 
[04:20:00]  Well, I don't know.  Maybe this ear has some.  I don't usually get...  You get it out of both ears?  No, I usually just get my left ear,  which sucks.  Let me see if I get any right ear.  I don't...  You're like a muskrat.  It's his defense mechanism.  Yeah.  I still might have some left.  I don't think so.  See if I got it.  Would that be a yes?  Yes.  You like the grape jelly setup?  It smells nothing like grape jelly. 
[04:20:30]  It smells like asshole and cadaver.  But I have to do the grape jelly thing.  I'm like, yeah,  it's kind of like a weird jelly vibe.  It's not like jelly.  It's like an open casket.  We did that once in a parking lot.  I laughed so hard that day.  It's only the left ear.  Yeah.  Come on.  We have no callers for the Giants.  We got the...  I'm not worried about that.  I'm enjoying this conversation.  There we go.  You're sick of talking about football.  You're probably sick of talking about football, right?  You just want to do the hang  and be funny and laugh and all that crap. 
[04:21:00]  Where am I from?  I'm from all over.  I'm from Houston.  I'm from Germany.  I'm from here.  I'm everywhere, man.  Where are you from?  Plainfield, New Jersey.  Oh, that's exciting.  Yeah, we're here.  Houston, everybody's just walking down there.  Hey, I'm born there.  I'm not where I grew up.  And that city's growing.  It is.  Huge.  I don't know that at all.  Admit.  That's the first time you ever heard  a black man say he was from Germany.  Admit that.  Admit it.  Just say yes, I admit it.  That's the first time I heard a black man  admit anything.  Father in the military? 
[04:21:30]  Father in the military.  Retired major.  Grew up over there.  Came back here.  What branch of the service?  Army.  Okay.  Man, the army, man.  My dad's a command sergeant major.  Reserves us, so we never traveled.  Yeah, we traveled a lot.  Big Gene.  Big Gene.  All right, let's go to Jason.  He's in Wisconsin.  Jason.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a question for Michael.  So, first of all, I'd like to say  I'm a huge Vikings fan.  Can't stand the Giants,  but I do like Tiki Barber.  That's good.  I know you like party boats, 
[04:22:00]  but anyway, go ahead.  That leads to my question right there.  My question for Michael is,  have you ever thought about comedy  after football?  Because I watch his ads,  and I just laugh at everyone.  He's so hilarious, I think.  You know what?  Actually, no.  These guys here are funny, man.  I'm just, I don't know.  I don't have,  these guys can sit here all day,  and you can smell behind their ears and stuff.  They can do this every day.  I don't know if I can do this every day.  But no, the commercial stuff is just fun.  I do it, and you know. 
[04:22:30]  And your show on Fox.  Yeah, the best damn sports show.  Yeah, you do a good job with that.  That's a lot of fun.  I like that,  and you can just let go  and not be so serious.  And, you know, I like it.  Who knows where it goes,  but I'm not as talented  as these other gentlemen here.  All right.  I'm in awe in their presence.  I have one more quick question for you.  Go ahead.  Who's your favorite quarterback to sack?  Please let me.  You know what?  I'll be a Donovan McNabb  because I hate the Eagles,  the city of Philadelphia.  There you go.  Dirty people throwing spit at you. 
[04:23:00]  You know, you'll be at the game,  and I remember one time,  I scored a touchdown in overtime.  We won the game,  and I'm in the end zone,  the team's celebrating,  and they were dipping.  You know, they're spitting in cups.  They're throwing that mess out of them.  They battering.  Yeah, Philly is...  They don't like me anyway,  so hell with Philly,  but they're nasty.  I don't like Philly.  They once, what,  booed Santa Claus or something like that?  They're legendary, their fans.  They boo injured players.  I mean...  They cheered.  This is when...  That's our biggest market  besides New York is Philly  because we're garbage,  and they're garbage. 
[04:23:30]  No, no, no.  But it's funny that  I have a love-hate relationship with them  because I was a Dallas fan,  and when Irvin got pulled off,  they cheered,  not because he was...  but because he had, like,  a neck injury.  I think at that end of his career.  End of his career, yeah.  Yeah.  And they cheered.  It's like,  you just don't cheer  when a guy gets pulled off  with a neck injury.  They did.  So you give a little extra  to McNabb?  Yeah, I try to.  He's a good friend of mine, man,  but I know...  I just...  Something about that team.  I just can't stand this.  All right.  Dirty and awful.  I do agree with you. 
[04:24:00]  Vernon from Oklahoma.  Vernon?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Vernon.  Hey, I got a question  for Dr. Smith.  I'm finishing day nine  of detox today,  and I'm freaking losing my mind,  but when we go into round two,  what are your thoughts  on, like, those...  like, the supplement bars,  as long as you don't have  a lot of sugar in them,  mixing those in?  But what kind of supplement?  Like, protein bars?  Yeah, like EAS  makes those protein bars,  and I know you mention in the book  not to, you know,  get on the power bars  because they're just filled  with sugar, 
[04:24:30]  but what do you think  about the round two?  Yeah, all I care about  for phase two  is making sure  that the calories  and the carb count  in the bars  have to be lower.  That's all.  Those bars are good.  I mean, they're good.  Some of them are really healthy,  but watch the calories.  I mean, it shouldn't be over,  you know, per bar,  about 60 calories,  and your carb shouldn't be over  like 10, 16, 10.  Okay?  Cool.  Is that cool?  Congrats, man.  Congrats.  Weigh yourself tomorrow morning.  Well, I did today.  I had to take a look,  and I'm at 14,  so I need one more pound 
[04:25:00]  to hit fans 15.  You lost 14 in eight days?  14 in eight days.  Dang, man.  Dr. Smith, thanks, buddy.  I love it, baby.  It's the Fat Smash Diet  from Dr. Smith.  How about those balance bars?  I used to eat those  and think I was doing really well,  but they're like Snickers bars.  They're actually better than candy.  That's true, though.  See, people don't realize that  because it looks healthy,  and they say it's healthy.  That stuff is balanced.  Fat pig I was going on a stage  and I was at a balance bar.  Mr. Healthy.  Prostitute in a balance bar.  Why am I not looking good  with a pretty girl on my arm?  Well, you can't supplement it 
[04:25:30]  with ribs and chicken fingers.  They call it that  because after you eat one,  you can balance  on the other side  of a seesaw with an anvil.  Yeah, please.  Well, just balance that joke  out with a wall.  I had that work.  I had that word  in so much better.  And the second Jimmy looked at me,  I lost everything.  Jimmy is like the intimidator.  He killed me.  He does give you that stare  when you're trying  to deliver the line.  I had a seesaw, anvil,  balance, nothing.  Your ratio is so good. 
[04:26:00]  It was a weird way  you were coming out with it.  You're very never worried.  Anvil is never worried.  He's to the point.  And I look at Jimmy  and know it's going nowhere.  Because I've bombed  so many times in my life,  you know when a juicy bomb  is about to come.  Internally, I'm going,  oh, this is going to be awful.  Let's go to Kenny  in New Jersey.  Kenny.  Hello, hello.  You're on with Dr. Ian Smith  and Michael Strahan.  Hey, Doc,  I was curious  if you really did have  any books to give away.  Because I'm becoming  a fat bastard  after quitting smoking. 
[04:26:30]  I have four copies  of the Fat Smash Diet here.  I don't know how,  Opie, how do we do this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We've done five hours of radio.  I don't know.  Here we go.  You ready?  I'm going to give you  the website, okay?  All right.  And you email me  from the website,  www.fatsmashdiet.com.  And there's an email link  and email me  and you're from Jersey, right?  www.fatsmashdiet.com.  I'm Kenny from New Jersey.  All right.  Make sure you put that in  and I'll have my assistant 
[04:27:00]  say it out.  How about this?  The doctor ain't too smart,  is he?  Can they put him on hold  and we can mail them out  for him because what will  happen is this,  1,500 Kenny from New Jersey  is from.  Yeah, okay.  You're going to give away  1,500 bucks  and you only have four books.  All right, hold on, Kenny.  Our audience are a bunch  of dishonest.  We'll mail it out to you.  All right, let's say hi  to Poppy in Mississippi.  Poppy.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  It's great to talk to you.  Dr. Smith, great book.  I'm on my 11th day 
[04:27:30]  and it's not so bad.  All right, pops.  Not so bad.  And?  That's it, huh?  I can't hear you guys at all.  You're right to the point.  Can you hear us?  How about now?  You all right?  Yeah, I can hear you now.  What about now?  Oh, it's a great...  I've lost like half  of my goal weight  in nine days.  So, great book.  And can I ask Michael a question?  Yes, sir, please.  Go ahead.  How is it like playing with Eli?  Eli, it's fun, man.  Eli looks like he's 12 years old,  to be honest with you. 
[04:28:00]  But he is...  Why do you have your thumbs down  over here?  Wow, Dr. Ian Smith  is giving the thumbs down to Eli.  Everybody gives Eli a hard time.  Eli Manning.  You know, Peyton Manning's running  all over the place  and doing his thing.  Archie Manning did his thing.  There's more pressure on Eli  than anybody.  Eli got much better.  I can't believe you're giving  the company line here.  No, no, no.  I'll be honest with you.  Hold on.  Eli, I will not sit here  and lie to you  and tell you that Eli  played like Joe Namath  the entire season.  But one thing that Eli did  is I can't be upset at Eli  if he doesn't play well  because he goes in every morning. 
[04:28:30]  He's there after work.  He works and does everything  he needs to do  to be a great player.  And as I said,  when your brother's doing  what he's doing  or your father did  what he did,  he has more pressure  than anybody.  I like the way he handles it.  He's going to be a great player.  You may not like that, Ian.  What's the problem?  The guy's going to be  a great player.  What's the problem, Ian?  Hey, Michael.  Yeah.  Michael.  Hey, ONA,  y'all need to get Eli.  I went to Ole Miss.  He is a living legend  in college  from what his  extracurricular activity.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I read in the paper  the other day 
[04:29:00]  he was singing  I'm Too Sexy or something  at some karaoke bar.  So he's becoming a legend  very quickly here  in New York, too.  No, I'm talking about  he's got some stories  of the women in Oxford  that would be great  on the after show  or the after the regular show.  Well, we'll see.  Okay.  We'll see if we can  finagle some of those.  All right, here's my...  You're wondering  why I'm rolling my eyes.  I'm rolling my eyes.  Are you a Giants fan,  by the way?  I love the Giants.  See, I'm a Jets fan,  but I can acknowledge...  Well, you know,  they say all Jets fans  are Giants fans  who couldn't get season tickets. 
[04:29:30]  I like that.  That's a good point.  Here's a problem.  He makes up all these excuses  about pressure and blah, blah.  Let me tell you something.  How are you going to tell a guy  who delivers mail  for $32,000 a year  that some guy is making  this multimillion dollars,  a contract,  and can't deliver,  but because he works hard,  it's okay.  Okay, fine.  Stop trying to suck up  on their mail delivery people, Ian.  Oh, I'm just saying.  Get out of here with that nonsense.  That's what he needs to do.  He works hard.  He's going to be a great player.  Give him time.  Okay, I work hard, too. 
[04:30:00]  You didn't know a doggone thing  about dieting  right when you got out  of medical school.  It took you some time to learn.  But I delivered, though.  Yeah, you delivered  four freaking books  for 15,000 people.  That's what you delivered.  Everyone gets a page, I guess.  Now you're turning  to my friends against me.  My real friends.  You know, Michael,  you're right.  We're starting to see  the true Dr. Ian Smith.  Next time I come in  with 25 books,  what's the number?  What's the right number, Jimmy?  I trust you.  I think 10 books is fine  because how many 
[04:30:30]  can you give away on the phone?  That's fine.  10 books.  You're going to be 9  because Jimmy wants  its free copy.  Oh, I already got one  signed in the back.  We all got them.  Hold on to that.  It's going to be worth something.  He's killing you.  Listen, Michael Strahan  is one of my best friends  in the world.  This is my brother.  I bring him up here.  Talk to you like this.  Yeah, but why are you  killing me in front of these people?  They don't know me like that.  Man, we're not sitting  on my couch at home.  I'm not sitting on the couch  with you at home either.  All right, more questions  for him.  Forget me.  Talk to Strahan.  All right, let's say hi  to Matt in Illinois. 
[04:31:00]  Matt.  Hey, Michael.  How you doing?  I'm good, man.  What's happening?  I love the Giants.  You guys are going to be  awesome to see, aren't you?  I think so.  Are they?  LaBar Aaronson?  Yeah.  And my question about  is Brandon Jacobs.  Is he going to get  a lot of playing time  you think this year?  I think so.  Brandon got a lot  of the rookie last year.  Toward the end of the year  he didn't get as much.  He's another guy  who started out  really heavy  and really hot.  But, you know,  the rookie,  you hit that wall  where about halfway  through the season  you're used to being finished.  And for us,  you just kind of get going. 
[04:31:30]  So he hit a wall last year.  I think this year  he's going to get  a lot more care.  He's going to help  Tiki out a lot.  All right, this is Dr. Ian.  Let me tell you the real deal.  The guy runs straight up.  He runs a little too high.  He needs to lower his...  See, I'll give you the real deal.  One thing about Dr. Ian,  I'll come and show  the wall, Doc.  Doc, you've done nothing more  than jump on a treadmill  for 10 minutes.  Let me explain something, man.  The dude hit a wall.  It's hard work.  Physically,  you get a little tired.  He runs...  You're going to tase him?  He runs straight.  He runs like a freaking tree.  All you have to do  is take a saw  and sort it down. 
[04:32:00]  He's 6'5", 270.  He's bigger than me.  Playing running back.  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  Now, you're right.  He does need  to lower his shoulders a little bit.  I don't know anything  about football.  That's right,  because I'm a doctor.  I've never played football  in my life,  so I wouldn't know anything.  Everyone, please call in  and talk to Michael Strahan  about the Fat Smash diet.  You said you're not funny.  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm a football player,  but I slept at  Holiday Inn Express last night,  so I know a lot  about doctoring and diet.  Let's go to Joe in Boston.  Hey, wait.  Did you have to run 
[04:32:30]  against Larry Allen?  Have you had to play  with Larry Allen?  Yeah, I played.  He's like a legalized killer, man.  I can't get Larry Allen jer...  Football makes me sick  with the fact  that they only put out  certain jer...  I could never get  an Eric Williams jersey,  and I could never get  a Larry Allen or a Leon Lett.  Eric Williams was the toughest  guy I ever played against.  Larry Allen was right there.  The car accident hurt him,  I think, though.  It did.  Set him back.  Before that,  he was mean.  He beat his mom up, man.  He's the only guy  that owned Reggie White.  Reggie White,  what would he put  the palm under your jaw?  Well, he was the only guy.  Reggie White was a preacher,  you know,  peaceful man for the most part. 
[04:33:00]  He's the only guy  I ever saw make Reggie White  fight on the football field.  So that's what I tell you.  You got a preacher fight, man.  That's good.  Hey, Jimmy's a Cowboys fan, Michael.  I could tell.  I mean, you know,  I could smell it.  And you have those good  Larry Allen stories?  Didn't he used to just spit  in the passenger seat  of his brand new car?  Well, Tyson Walters played  for that.  He was told that Larry  was spitting his Mercedes  like he would just,  he had to chew  and he would drive  and he would just spit  on the passenger seat  floor of his Mercedes.  I can't believe it.  I can believe it.  He's a messy guy.  He's a messy guy.  You know how big he is? 
[04:33:30]  He's very good, yeah.  I met him at the Pro Bowl.  He's big is not big, man.  He's unbelievable.  Larry Allen.  I met him at the Pro Bowl  and shook his hand  and was like,  okay, what do I do now?  He was quiet.  You talk a little crap to him  and he'd just look at you  and smile.  That's intimidating, man.  I like a guy  to say something back.  Now, Pro Bowl last year,  he actually spoke to me  after playing against him  for 10 years or whatever.  Finally said more words  than one.  I put together a sentence.  I was happy.  I feel like we're friends.  Is he one of the most respected?  I guess he is, right? 
[04:34:00]  Yeah, without a doubt.  One of the most respected.  Probably one of the most feared.  You just don't line up  straight ahead  and just try to run him over.  It's not going to happen.  By the way, Jimmy,  I think Tyson signed  with Washington.  Oh, good.  Okay, good.  I was hoping he'd last year.  He called me recently  after he signed.  We're good friends  with Tyson Walter.  He played with the Cowboys  for a little while  and then he got to let go.  He don't know Tyson Walter.  Huh?  He don't know Tyson Walter.  I'll beat him down this year  if he's with the Redskins.  He doesn't know Tyson Walter.  The response he gave you was...  That's okay. 
[04:34:30]  I have heard of the name  Tyson Walter.  That's right.  See?  I have heard of the name.  I can't say about telling him.  I doubted him.  But you know what?  To be honest with you,  after a certain amount of time,  I already pushed Matt Leiner  and Vince Young.  That's all I can tell you  about the draft this year  because that's all I hear about.  I don't pay attention anymore.  I worry about...  I would say to Opie,  this is Opie's show.  The respected guy.  I say, you know,  I don't know him,  but, you know,  just respect him.  That's all I'm saying.  There's been a lot of gentlemen  in the NFL.  How about Leon?  I keep track of every one of them.  Leon Lett.  Leon Lett always got a bad rap.  Leon was a good guy.  The big cat, fantastic. 
[04:35:00]  He got a bad rap  because the fucking stupid Don Beebe  knocked the ball out of his hand  in the Super Bowl.  No, I think the alcohol and drugs  may have gave him the bad rap.  Oh, he slid into the ball  on Thanksgiving against the Dolphins.  He didn't know.  Leon got nervous.  You know, he just made  silly blunders.  What does he know?  The Leon Lett rule up.  Yeah, Leon,  he made a few errors  that were very, very obvious  in big games.  All right, a couple more questions  and then we're going to get out of here.  Let's say hi to Travis in Iowa.  Travis.  Yeah, I got a question for Michael.  I know that football, 
[04:35:30]  I want to know if you're  kind of a big star now.  I shouldn't say kind of.  You're a huge star and everything,  but is the game still fun  or is it too much of a business?  Is it too much bullshit?  I mean, is it still fun  to go out and play?  Yeah, I love it.  You know, that's the,  Jerome Bettis put it best  when Jerome Bettis said,  I love the game  but practice is just what  makes him not want to do it anymore.  And I'll be honest with you,  just to practice,  if it could be like  Alan Iverson,  practice, practice,  practice, practice.  If I could miss practice every day, 
[04:36:00]  I could play for another 20 years.  You know, the funny thing is  when this guy's going to go  to training camp,  so we play golf all spring.  I hope he plays golf too.  We're going to play together.  We play golf all spring  and you can tell.  I beat this.  Man, I win so much money off,  Doc.  I supplement my income.  Anyway, go ahead.  I can't even finish the story today.  Like what?  Sell them books,  boy, I need that money.  I'm a high school coach  and I go to these camps  and these clinics  and there's millions of dollars  on the line, 
[04:36:30]  you know,  for tenths of seconds  on the 40.  I just think,  you know,  wow.  You got to love it  to do it though.  After a certain amount  of time financially,  it really,  the money comes down  to mean nothing.  At some point,  you want to win,  you want to contribute,  you want to produce  and that becomes a good thing.  So for me,  it's fun because I get to play  with a lot of young guys  who are first,  second years.  I can see how they're  as excited as I was  when I was that young  and a lot of things  in our business now  that I didn't see a lot  earlier in my career.  But at the same time, 
[04:37:00]  I love it.  If I didn't,  then I would probably  sell Fat Smash Diet books.  I'm going to finish  my story now  if you don't mind.  Yes.  So we play golf all spring  and you can tell  when the season's coming,  the golf season's coming  to a close  in training camp  because he starts whining.  He starts,  you know,  he gets real cranky  and I'm like,  you know,  he's like,  oh,  I got to go up  and,  you know,  where's your thing,  up in Albany?  You know,  training camp is coming  and he's just cranky  and irritable.  I'm like,  dude,  you're getting ready  to make who knows  how much money.  More money than I'm making 
[04:37:30]  you know,  yeah,  but training camp,  training camp,  then he comes,  he goes away,  it's like,  you know,  we send him off,  all the guys send him off.  Then he comes home  and he just kills people.  We're proud of you.  Focus, man.  We're proud of you.  Thank you.  How many years  have you been playing?  13.  It's 14 coming up.  Wow.  We got a question  from one of our interns.  I guess he's a big Giants fan.  Yeah,  how you doing?  I'm good, man.  I know your good friends  with Brett Favre.  How do you feel  about him coming back?  You know,  I'm happy he's coming back.  I don't know  if it's good or bad.  He said he wants to come back 
[04:38:00]  and be on the team  as contender.  I don't necessarily  think they're contenders,  so you know what?  I just hope he doesn't  come back and regret it.  Do you think  there's going to be  a big difference  with like no  possibly no receiver  and Walker coming back  and the team  kind of going downhill?  You see the same thing  like happened last year?  Well,  it's tough  because talent-wise,  I don't know  if they match up,  but also you have  a new coach.  You have all those  different things.  When you have  all those things,  what's so funny, man?  He's nervous.  I'm just watching his.  I'm waiting  for him to ask me  a bad question  so I can spring  out of my seat. 
[04:38:30]  The questions  aren't bad.  It was just  the nervous mic shake  and the lean against  the wall.  I'm usually not  starstruck,  but I'm a huge  Giants fan,  so it's kind of  a big deal for me.  I usually don't  get starstruck  whatsoever.  I appreciate it.  You're five  coming back.  That's a good idea.  Do you think  they're going to  win the big game?  You nervous idiot.  Give him a ball.  But it's going to be  tough, man,  because they've got  a new team,  new coach.  It's going to be  extremely tough for him.  That play you made  was awesome.  Remember that time 
[04:39:00]  when you caught the ball?  That was good.  I give that clammy mic  back to somebody  that knows how to use it.  Well, no,  do you get any more  questions?  No, one question.  All right.  The next question.  How do you think  it's done?  All right, go away.  Get out.  Let's go to...  No, what cares?  Can you give me  that guy's information?  Which guy?  Buffalo?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Tell him to email me  or something.  We'll end with him,  but first it's  Ben in New York.  Ben.  What's up?  Michael Strahan.  What's up, my man? 
[04:39:30]  What's up, man?  Hey, man.  It's a great  Larry Holmes invitation,  dude.  That's awesome.  Hey, listen.  How do you feel  about Favre?  I mean, obviously  you're friends with Favre,  but did he really  lay down for you  to get that sack title?  Wow, he was on the ground,  so I guess that  constitutes laying down.  Who's got the most  delicious-looking  cock in the locker room?  Actually, that would  be your mother.  How could you  see it in her mouth?  Hey, I got a question  for Mike. 
[04:40:00]  Have you ever played  at the Comedy Cabaret  in Northeast Philly  this weekend?  Yes, I am.  Hey, after what I said  about Philadelphia  on this show,  I'm going down there  with security, man.  One more call  and then we'll get  out of here.  Boy, you're talking  about calls.  How you doing?  No kidding.  Hang on, man.  That's what happens  every day after we get  off the air,  but people don't realize  we're still doing radio.  Pat in Buffalo.  You got a question  for Dr. Ian Smith?  Yeah, I want to get  my hands on that book  because I'm the kind  of person Jimmy shudders  when he sees get  on a plane next to him.
