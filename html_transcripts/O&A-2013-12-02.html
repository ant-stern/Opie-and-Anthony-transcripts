<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing their uncensored style.  They discussed their Thanksgiving break, followed by complaints about their failing New York sports teams.  Norton recounted an allergy-induced Long Island accent and his post-break disorganization; Opie grumbled about the upcoming Christmas tree.  A substantial portion focused on Black Friday chaos, with callers describing violent incidents, stun guns, and injuries at various stores. One host shared a negative experience with a Santa Claus photo.  The hosts mused on the absurdity of Black Friday and Amazon's drone delivery plans.  This segment ended with the announcement of guest Jim Brewer and a brief discussion of an old music video.

The show then delved into the disturbing case of Ian Watkins, the Lost Prophets singer convicted of horrific child sex crimes, including the attempted rape of an infant. Callers, including a child protective services worker, detailed the crimes and the alarming prevalence of child sexual abuse and maternal complicity. The conversation shifted to the graphic details of Paul Walker's fatal car crash, including descriptions from online photos.  Jim Brewer then joined the studio. He discussed his 90-year-old father's dementia and his struggles with his father's care, as well as his mother's mental health issues and the challenges of choosing elder care. He also shared anecdotes about his teenage daughters, including one's fascination with heavy metal and another's social media obsession, and his own history of self-harm.

Brewer’s segment continued with a discussion about risky teenage sexual behavior and parental strategies for prevention, leading into the premiere of his new Christmas song, "Santa Ain't Coming to Town." He then detailed his African safari with his family and James Hetfield, recounting near-fatal encounters with elephants and hippos. He promoted his comedy tour and podcast, and the hosts mentioned their podcasts featuring Michael Madsen and Patrice O'Neal.  The segment concluded with a 1989 video clip of Sam Kinison and an anecdote about two unnamed male radio station employees making crude, sexually explicit comments about women visiting the studio.

The next segment centered on that same 1989 VHS tape, featuring Sam Kinison and "Wheeze."  The focus shifted to the two unnamed men's explicit and objectifying commentary on women, using highly offensive language and descriptions of their bodies.  The hosts discussed the video’s rediscovery and online release, comparing 1980s media sharing to today's platforms.  A call to a porn chat line with Jenna Jameson was included. The segment ended with a discussion of the Star Wars Holiday Special.


The final segment began with a discussion about children's weight at fat camp, transitioning to teenage celebrity crushes (including a focus on Rob Zombie's difficult interview).  Fantasies about camping trips with Mick Foley, Hulk Hogan, Eddie Murphy, and 50 Cent followed, with explicit details about sexual encounters and body parts. Jim Brewer's discussion about his 14-year-old daughter's dating life prompted further explicit discussion of the hosts' teenage experiences and sexual encounters, including graphic descriptions of penises. Frequent guest Nicole joined, discussing an episode of Guy Fieri's "Big Bites" and Guy Fieri's perceived inappropriate behavior towards her. The segment ended with more discussion of Nicole's dating life and further explicit talk of sex, concluding with the announcement of the next segment featuring Ron and Fez.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning, everyone.  Whoa, what's up with that?  Hello.  Oh, that sounds good.  All right.  Perish the thought.  We're gone more than, you know, the standard weekend. 
[00:01:30]  Long weekend.  Yeah.  How was everyone's Thanksgiving?  Oh, well.  Yuck.  Good, everyone.  I ate too much.  It was a nice break.  It was a nice break.  Nice break in the action?  Yeah.  It was fun.  There's a lot to talk about.  But can I just say that Geno Smith stinks?  Oh, no.  What happened?  He's pretty much the worst quarterback in the NFL. 
[00:02:00]  But he was getting rave reviews.  Oh, boy, was he at the beginning of the year.  Yeah.  I don't know if the team's figured out his shit or not, but he stinks.  What'd they pull him?  They pulled him at halftime because he was four for ten for a total of 29 yards passing.  Oh, does he stink?  Like, people are starting to think about Sanchez again.  That's how bad he is.  Sanchez. 
[00:02:30]  Fucking Sanchez.  Why is that even still a fucking option?  I don't know.  So then I was thinking, all right, my Jets stink.  At least I got my...  Oh, that's right.  The Knicks stink, too.  The Knicks are 3-13.  Yeah, I heard that on the news this morning.  You don't watch basketball.  I understand that.  No.  The Knicks are 3-13.  I heard they threw up nine in a row, I think.  Yes, that's right.  And seven at the Garden.  Yeah.  Carmelo Anthony stinks.  What happened?  Well, he doesn't make other people better around him. 
[00:03:00]  That's why he stinks, and I can't wait for the Knicks to be done with him.  Fuck Carmelo Anthony.  Fuck.  So then at least I got the...  Oh, that's right.  The Islanders suck, too.  Oh, man.  God, is this going to be a long winter.  What the fuck?  Got nothing.  I'm not a huge sports guy, but I like to take my peeks.  There's nothing to peek at.  You want to see a little, you know...  All right, well, there's Knicks.  Head jets.  Stick.  Damn. 
[00:03:30]  Allergy attacks.  That's a good one.  Because kids are jumping up and down on my sofa.  My sofa.  Your sofa.  That's how I talk when I got allergies.  Your sofa.  The Long Island accent comes out when I got allergies.  My sofa.  They jump up and down, and I see the dust just coming off the fucking thing.  Oh, man.  Don't that maid vacuum it?  Yeah, the maid vacuums it all right.  Vacuums that couch.  Yeah.  Sofer.  She vacuums the sofa. 
[00:04:00]  Fuck.  My eyes.  One sneeze, and my eyes are pouring water.  Yeah.  Welcome back, everyone.  Yes.  To this shithole.  Oh, man.  I just could not get my shit together.  Whenever we take a few days off...  Right.  I wake up, and it seems like everything I need has been hidden.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I roam around the house looking for shoes, wallet, like everything... 
[00:04:30]  Tissues, please.  Everything I haven't had to really, you know, put in my pocket or anything.  You don't have a spot for all that stuff?  I do, but I don't know.  Sometimes it gets moved.  I don't know.  I have a spot for my lip balm, my building ID, my apartment keys, my wallet.  No, to me, it's like my stupid shoes.  Yeah.  I kick them off somewhere, and who the hell knows where they are. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, so I got out of the house later than I like, and then, oh, the traffic.  But, well, you know, you can complain, but who's going to listen to traffic?  All right, tree time.  We get to deal with the fucking tree for the next month.  That stupid tree.  The big fucking Christmas tree.  Stupid tree.  Yeah.  When you've seen one tree, you've seen them all.  I know.  Who cares?  I got my memories from when I was a kid.  I don't need to see that stupid tree anymore. 
[00:05:30]  The stupid tree.  Are they lighting the stupid tree today?  When do they do that?  I think it's today.  Really?  Yeah, so you better get the fuck out, because everyone's, like, heading in.  They're heading in right now for the tree.  Is it again?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's a big fucking deal.  So, I mean, you know, it could be worse.  We could be on a Metro North train, so.  Well, that must have been entertaining.  I'm going to say it right now.  I think somebody was texting.  I'm going with texting.  You're going with texting? 
[00:06:00]  Fuck yeah.  And by somebody, it would have to be the engineer.  He's saying that the brakes failed.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  I don't know about that.  Because that's, like, a dead man's fucking curve over there.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen that turn?  No.  Before?  It's a nasty turn.  And it's just north of Manhattan, basically.  And, uh, yeah.  You've got to slow the fuck down.  I bet he was, like, fucking so.  He was trying to get one more fucking text in before the curve, I bet you.  Before he had to slow down.  I'm just guessing. 
[00:06:30]  I have no idea.  But it's too fishy that the brakes failed.  Yeah.  In this day and age.  I don't know.  Blame it on the equipment.  I think it's always human error.  That's why.  Let's go with robots.  It's time for robots.  They're not going to be texting.  Take the humans out of the loop.  What do we got?  Four dead, though, right?  Damn.  Four dead and 63 injured?  That's horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  You're just on that little choo-choo train there.  From Poughkeepsis.  Yeah.  Christ. 
[00:07:00]  But.  Too much.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I know.  Getting back into this shit.  Can we just take the rest of the year off?  How great would that be?  The rest of the year.  Why not?  It's going to be a quick four weeks.  We take, what, a week and a half at the end, at least?  Don't we?  Yeah.  We should take at least a nice week or two at the end.  Yeah, but then we burn our fucking days, and then you can't go anywhere.  That's what I hate about that.  Or a week, at least.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I'd definitely take the between Christmas and New Year's thing.  Yeah, but then we can't go on a real vacation because these fucking assholes, these bean  counters count every fucking day we take.  I think we still have some time, though.  I sure hope so.  After that.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Well, we had a nice vacation we could have taken.  What do you mean?  Oh, well, yeah.  Oh, boy.  The boat thing?  Yeah.  I'll just call it what it is.  The boat thing.  I'll go on a boat appearance.  I'll do the boat activity. 
[00:08:00]  The boat thing.  I want to see the boat movie.  Yeah.  Well, we were going to have a boat movie, all right.  Yeah.  It's going to be a hell of a boat movie.  Oh, well.  Oh, God.  So Thanksgiving was good for everybody, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went to my brother's house, and I visited Iraq's Christmas gift.  It was nice.  All right.  I saw that picture.  It was really nice to see that it's doing very well at my brother's house.  A picture of the poster.  Yeah.  And we were going to set up a goof shot.  I go, you know what?  Scott, we don't need to set up a goof shot. 
[00:08:30]  I just want to take a nice picture of my Christmas present from Eric Nagel.  How long ago was that?  A couple years now.  Damn.  Too long.  But it's in a nice place.  It's in his office now next to a YouTube poster.  It looks good.  It looks great.  You see it?  Yeah.  And now I got it on my phone, so it's just like having it in my house.  It's just like having it.  Look, I can visit it right now.  Look at that.  It's a nice fucking poster.  It's who gave you the YouTube poster that you gave to him.  No, he's a huge YouTube fan.  He probably got that on his own. 
[00:09:00]  What?  I have a lot of windows in my place.  Yeah.  How was your Thanksgiving, Eric?  It was very good.  Very good?  Very good.  Why was it very good?  Well, Thanksgiving was great.  Lots of good food, as you would expect.  Of course.  And then the weekend, putting all my Christmas stuff up, which is exciting.  Yeah.  Why do you guys do that?  Anthony did it, too.  I did.  Well, I saw people grabbing their Christmas trees yesterday.  Yeah.  I'm like, no. 
[00:09:30]  And I got two little kids.  I'm going to wait at least another week.  You know why?  Right, because Thanksgiving was a little late this year.  True.  We only got, what, three and a half weeks left?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, it's like, boom, it's December.  You know.  Right.  Once it's December, that's Christmas.  Yeah.  At my little house.  And overdid it a little.  I fucking plugged that shit in 15 minutes after Thanksgiving was over.  All you need is synchronized music with it.  Yeah.  Once you do synchronized music, that would be cool.  That's all I need.  Why not? 
[00:10:00]  Neighbors would really fucking love that.  For someone that doesn't like fucking people in general.  Right.  The Valkyries.  You got a house now that people are going to have to stop and check out.  Oh, I love people.  Why would you want that?  I love people.  You don't love people.  You hate people.  I love people.  I'm a people person.  You're not a people.  You're neither of those things.  I had my poker game Saturday, and everyone came over.  It's fun.  I saw the picture Twitter photo.  Carl dropped by.  Did he have a good time?  He was done with the touche in Bayshore, and he stopped by the house. 
[00:10:30]  E-Ruck, yes?  I like how you had another edition of Big A taking photos that you weren't aware of.  Yes.  When Colin was enjoying your movie theater.  Yes, yes.  And he got a picture of Carl sitting in one of the seats.  Yeah.  And he posted.  Big A just going around, snapping his little picture.  Sneaking around.  Sneaking around.  He's going to capture one thing.  He's going to get the equivalent of the Oswald in the fucking depository picture without meaning to. 
[00:11:00]  He was photographing the Stephen's freeway sign.  Yeah, him and his cousin there, Tim Gage.  Tim Gage showed up.  Sure.  But he doesn't do well to come he is.  No, him and Joe were there in the same room there.  They were.  They didn't beat the shit out of each other.  They fought back in the day, right?  Rumor has it.  Yeah.  Is it true or not?  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  But apparently. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  But yeah, I had a good time.  Carl didn't stay long.  He just kind of dropped in to say hi.  You had to check it out.  Yeah.  Yeah, he checked it out and then we got on with our little poker game.  How big is the cat now?  It's almost too big.  Oh, he's beautiful.  He is beautiful.  You got to get another cat.  He is pretty big.  I know, but I kind of feel like I missed his growing up.  He's so old.  He's only four months.  He's a little guy.  I know, but I missed his youth, I think.  I only saw him once.  That's a big cat already.  Yeah, it's a fucking beast. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, you're going to have to get another kitten.  Yeah, you should kill that one.  Oh, no.  All the Christmas decorations are up and he's already fucking swatting at them.  No.  He's not behaving at all.  Little shithead.  You're raising a shitty cat.  He stands up and swats at things.  Like, he'll just fucking stand up on his hind legs and just swat at things.  Very cute.  Yeah.  Little spotty guy.  Does he scratch people?  No, he's pretty good with everybody. 
[00:12:30]  Everyone comes over for the poker game and everything and he just walks around.  He doesn't care.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  Is it hot in here?  It is fucking hot in here, right?  Let's turn down the fucking heat, Morris.  Turn that fucking...  What are you waiting for, Jesus?  Everything's got to be readjusted.  Re-readjusted.  Yeah, let's get all our fucking buttons back where they belong.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  Anyone do the Black Friday thing?  We actually did the Black Friday thing.  Did you?  You went to a store?  Wow.  On Friday.  I went to the Walt Whitman Mall.  Damn! 
[00:13:00]  How was that?  Well, I tweeted that I'm the worst Black Friday shopper ever.  Yeah?  I actually went to a crowded mall, got a crowded parking spot, walked into a crowded department  store, thinking I could sneak in that way, into the crowded part of the mall.  All right.  And a mere two and a half hours later, I came out with one $50 t-shirt and $80 worth  of socks.  Oh, God.  That's what I went to the mall for.  Was the line a little long at the register? 
[00:13:30]  Everywhere.  It's...  Everywhere.  So not only did I only get those things, it took forever to pay for them.  I figured it was time to get all new socks.  Yeah.  Once a year, I just blow out my sock collection.  Good thing to do.  I get attached to socks.  Oh, fuck that.  I blow them out.  I got brand new socks on right now.  It could be one of life's simple pleasures.  We are great.  Piss socks don't have a long shelf on.  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Going after me today.  Brutal. 
[00:14:00]  You're like fucking...  I'm not playing today.  Going after me today.  Brutal.  I do piss sock, though.  I do do that.  Do do.  I do do that.  Oh.  You're right.  Oh, my God.  I just go golden toe, man.  Yeah.  The golden toe people were all excited that I talked about golden toe.  So you would think they would fucking send me some golden toe.  Oh, socks.  Instead of fucking tweeting that, they're excited that I'm talking about them.  Yeah.  Send me some fucking socks. 
[00:14:30]  Put your socks where your mouth is.  Exactly.  I see.  So.  So that Black Friday thing, I was all the way out east for Thanksgiving, and we're driving  home around, I don't know.  I guess it was just before 8.  Yeah.  It was just before 8.  And we had to stop and get something for the kid, either a diaper or milk or something.  I forgot.  And it was right next to a Walmart.  And how I had to loop around to get to a drugstore, basically.  I got to see the Walmart.  And there was a lot. 
[00:15:00]  I couldn't believe it.  Thanksgiving night.  I guess they were opening the doors at 8, because the line was moving.  But it had to be, if I had to guess, it had to be 300 to 400 people online outside the  Walmart waiting to get in.  Who the fuck wants to do that?  I mean, the line was slowly moving.  Who wants to do that?  Walmart opened at 6 p.m. on Thursday.  That's great.  Then why?  This was around 8.  Maybe this one opened up at 8?  They had different sales.  Or was it Target?  It was either Target or Walmart. 
[00:15:30]  Every two hours, they change their sales or something.  Do they?  Who gives a shit, though?  I mean...  When you see that, do you...  I was thinking, like, how depressing that people...  Is this a case that people just don't have the money to buy shit regular price?  And, like, there's people that really just...  They see everybody enjoying iPads and stuff, and they have to have it.  Is that what it's...  Yeah, they're on a budget, so they're probably actually getting some real shopping done.  Yeah.  But even when I had no money, I didn't want to deal with that shit.  Fuck that.  Can't they do it online or no?  They can't just buy stuff online for the same price?  You're right. 
[00:16:00]  Even when I was a broke motherfucker, right?  But as you get closer to Christmas, they drop the prices on everything to get those last-minute  sales in.  You have plenty of opportunities to get sales, is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  To do a Thanksgiving night.  8 o'clock at night.  I couldn't believe this.  Fuck that.  Right.  Fuck that.  Oh, man.  I was pretty amazed by that.  I wanted to go in so bad.  Yeah?  Yeah, just to check out the craziness.  I saw some videos.  That's close enough. 
[00:16:30]  Some crazy videos of some crazy people.  Apparently there was a woman with a goddamn stun gun.  Stun gun, yeah.  I know this mall.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I've been in this mall many times.  When I go down to Philly, we go to this mall.  Oh, well, this is the mall of choice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's Frankfurt Mills, right?  Is it nice?  That's where we go to check out juice.  Oh, Jesus.  I joke about it every once in a while.  Me and my brother-in-law, we go there to check out Black Hineys. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  And they call it juice.  They go, hey, we want to go to the mall and check out some juice.  And we go.  Uh-huh.  So it's that mall, yeah.  I know this mall very well.  Well, apparently there was a woman being assaulted.  She breaks out the stun gun.  Those fucking animals people are.  A little fight going on.  In the mall.  There it is.  Wow, that rules.  Good for her. 
[00:17:30]  I love it.  Good for her.  Carry a stun gun.  That's great.  It beats a real gun.  Can you get in trouble for carrying a stun gun?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Woman tasered in mall medley.  Black Friday medley.  Yeah.  Yeah, there was that.  And then there was a few of those where it's just pandemonium.  People screaming, tugging at fucking boxes. 
[00:18:00]  And it just got like, you see these guys pushing women, grabbing at these boxes, trying  to get that TV.  It's just this, it really is a disgusting display.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, getting all those people in one place with sales.  It doesn't bring out the best in people, I will say.  Watch the police do nothing, this guy writes on his video.  What are you supposed to do?  This is what this is supposed to happen. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, grabbing for shit.  What fucking pigs?  It really is piggish.  Why does the rest of the world hate us?  They don't even have fucking water.  Yeah.  Why do they hate us?  We don't understand.  Fighting over TVs.  Right.  That's who we are, though.  We wonder why every politician's a scumbag.  That's where they come from.  Yeah, you're right.  This video's boring, by the way. 
[00:19:00]  And then they announce some other sale, and what, they all run to another place in the  store?  I don't know.  Just see.  Yeah, why do they announce the sales like that?  They actually want this bedlam in their store.  Yes.  Because it looks like, wow, there's some great stuff happening.  Sure.  Yes.  They kind of deserve it.  I never dealt with that.  I don't know.  Maybe someone could explain that to us.  I don't know.  The Black Friday phenomenon.  We all have them in our family.  Those people, whether it's your aunt or a friend of the family, that they can't wait  to get online and go to Black Friday shopping. 
[00:19:30]  And I don't want to hear.  And it used to be where you had to stay up all night, but now they said, fuck staying  up all night when we could open the stores at 8 o'clock Thanksgiving.  I don't want to hear that they're broke, either.  Like, oh, shit.  You know, you guys talk like that, but people need to get to sales.  I was wondering if it was that or not.  I don't think it is.  I don't fucking think it is.  It might be for some people, but for the most part, I think people, like, enjoy this.  They love going home and saying, oh, look at what I got. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  I got this on sale.  Yeah, they enjoy the whole drama of dumb Black Friday.  When Black Friday comes.  I wonder how it was in that mall in Atlanta where that guy used to do the security guard  guy.  All right.  Taser people.  Remember him?  That must be great.  Yeah.  And now it's, what, Cyber Monday.  We're up to Cyber Monday.  How was Small Business Saturday?  And what was yesterday?  I don't even fucking know.  You got the Black Friday. 
[00:20:30]  You got the Small Business Saturday and nothing yesterday?  Small Business just carried over into Sunday.  Well, Sunday.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But, yeah, the...  I don't think the Small Business Saturday works.  There's no small businesses.  That's the problem.  That's what I'm getting at.  Yeah.  And then why Cyber Monday when you have access to your computer constantly?  I don't know.  It's not...  But they're saying everybody's going back to work so they can shop at their computers.  Yeah, like they don't have them at home or on your phone or...  Yeah.  But they got special deals only today? 
[00:21:00]  Not really.  No.  Oh.  That's another load of shit.  Oh.  You can get the same dumb bargains.  Yeah.  It's a Black Friday bargain so you can get at the website.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  On Friday.  Well, we got guys that did the Black Friday thing.  You want to try to get into the mind of a Black Friday shopper?  Yes.  I'd go just to check out the people, but I wouldn't fucking deal with trying to yank shit from  other people and wait in line to pay for it.  Bunch of people in the head.  Carlos in Tennessee.  What's up? 
[00:21:30]  California, bro.  Carlos.  Wow.  That's...  How did they get Tennessee out of California?  What's going on, Carlos?  I worked in the OCH department on the Black Friday, the Thursday evening sale.  Yeah.  And, I mean, there's just an entire massacre there of people.  I think we had a fight.  People fighting over a crock pot in the home department.  Was it a fight?  A fight?  A couple of people? 
[00:22:00]  Sorry, I don't know what my heart is beating, like, fucking 50 miles a minute.  Oh, sorry.  You sound delightful and relaxed.  You really are a big deal.  Yeah.  All right, Carlos.  We had a Marine officer manager running into the electronics department yelling, who wants  an iPad?  Who wants an iPad mini?  Mini, mini.  You want an iPad mini?  Yeah.  And everybody's just fighting over here.  I want one.  And we had, like, lines of, like, at least 400 people.  Yeah.  Crawling.  All right.  Gotcha.  An amazing call.  Thanks, Carlos. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, no.  He was all nervous.  Let's go to Kristen in New York.  And he failed.  He failed to entertain us.  Isn't that great?  It's like, oh, the caller failed to entertain the hosts.  Thumbs down.  That's what it comes down to, doesn't it?  Kristen in New York.  What part of New York?  What part?  I'm in Salamanca.  I'm an hour south of Buffalo.  Wow.  Yeah.  Kind of no man's land.  Ah.  Fucking. 
[00:23:00]  Go ahead.  Did the Bills win yesterday?  I need to know.  No.  And they played in Toronto, right?  They did.  And there's a great picture of Rob Ford eating a chicken wing.  I guess that diet's working well for the guy.  I'm sure that it is.  Did you see the picture yet?  I have not.  The guy's supposed to be on a major fucking diet.  And they got him chomping on chicken wings in Toronto watching the Bills.  Anyway, what do you got, Kristen?  I just wanted to say that we used to do Black Friday shopping for a few years in a row until 
[00:23:30]  about three or four years ago I was seven months pregnant and a woman pushed me to get to a TV.  So she just kind of tapped out after that because, you know, physically pregnant and this woman...  Well, let me ask you, were you in the way of the TV?  Yes.  Apparently so.  There you go.  That's a fair question.  There you go.  Why would you go to a Black Friday thing if you're seven months pregnant?  Yeah.  Well, good point.  But I wanted to go with my mom because my mom was afraid to go by herself. 
[00:24:00]  So I thought, well, what the hell?  How would she go there?  Yeah.  She brought a pregnant bodyguard.  This just sounds like something you two should have stayed at home.  Yeah.  It sounds like you weren't that smart.  Jesus.  Well, I agree.  It was probably not our best judgment call, but we went, we tried it, and it failed miserably.  So we decided that we would not do that again.  But also, on your point, you had asked if you could get the prices online, and yes, I bought 
[00:24:30]  everything online this year.  For the same price, right?  Of course.  Yeah, the same price.  Yep.  It was delivered right to your house.  Right.  I don't have to fucking drive around.  Thanksgiving Day.  Right.  Yeah, everybody at Walmart was fighting over 32-inch TVs that were $99.  Yeah.  Like, at most, they're $189.  That's right.  I bought the exact same TV on Thanksgiving Day this year for a present that was less than  $75 more than what it was on Black Friday. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  You just fucking go online.  Buy online.  Exactly.  Just do it that way.  All right.  It's great.  Thanks, boys.  Have a good day.  Good job, Kristen.  Unlike the other guy.  Yeah.  Parking at the mall is like, how far away do you have to park?  Not too bad.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I know a little area.  Oh, the secret.  You got to know the side roads to the mall.  Not the big fucking entrances.  And you also have to bail on getting the good spot.  Yeah? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, you got to bail.  Well, that's what I mean.  You go a little deeper and just fucking deal with it.  The walk, it's not that cold out.  No, but when it gets like fucking freezing cold and stuff, that's a bitch.  True.  Windy.  And you're like, ah, I got to park far away.  The other problem, too, because I was at the mall on Friday, too.  Yeesh.  And the thing about Black Friday is that it's all people who don't go to the mall, usually.  Uh-huh.  So they don't know how to do anything.  Oh, my God.  That's like putting your ticket in the parking machine takes a half an hour because nobody 
[00:26:00]  knows.  No clue.  Nobody's paid for parking.  They don't know how to pay for stuff at the register.  No, they're just sitting in the hallways at the mall, just looking around.  Everybody's just so slow.  Man, nobody knows how to fucking walk in the mall where they're just like five people abreast  doing a shuffle and you can't get past them.  Holy shit.  Now, did we want to stop at Bed Bath & Beyond?  That's not here, Dad.  When a group of people is walking and you're behind them and then they'll just stop to  chat in the middle of the walkway. 
[00:26:30]  Hey, it's infuriating.  Yeah.  Get out of the way.  I forgot there was one other thing that happened at the mall I'm going to show you.  Oh.  Fucking Santa Claus ripped me off.  What?  That motherfucker.  That's awesome.  Santa.  My young son who's...  My young son in the car.  All in with the Santa Claus is like, holy fuck.  And we're like, all right.  So we get in line and we do the famous Santa Claus picture, right?  Yeah.  But the little one was not having it.  So this is my official Santa Claus picture. 
[00:27:00]  I wish I could...  Oh my God.  I wish I could tweet it, but I just...  That kid is...  I just don't put my kids online.  I don't really want them to be too public.  That kid's catterwalling.  Yeah.  My little daughter is screaming bloody murder and my son has no clue that his sister is  screaming bloody murder.  She's not going to ruin his time with Santa.  And he's got a nice smile on his face.  So she was not going to calm down for the Santa Claus picture.  So I got this and then I go, well, can we at least get one with just a kid? 
[00:27:30]  And they charged me for two fucking packages.  Oh boy.  Those twats.  And in that photo, though, she's technically the right one.  Yelling and screaming, there's a stranger holding me.  Like, that's the right attitude to have.  We're going to send this out because this is going to be my Christmas card.  That's hilarious.  You got her just wailing uncontrollably and him smiling like it's the happiest day of  his life.  But you would think they would go, hey, we'll give you that one for free because we can't  do anything with that.  But they charged me for two packages.  Yeah, they don't care.  And yeah, of course I can afford it, but it's just, just, it's just that they try to 
[00:28:00]  fuck you.  It's just twatty.  They just do it every chance they get.  Every chance they get.  They just, every nickel they fucking.  Right.  I just thought they would throw that in as an extra.  Yeah.  They're like, well, it's two packages.  How many eight by tens do you want?  And do you want wallet sizes?  What year is this?  Just send me a digital.  I said, no, I was out almost a hundred bucks.  It's like, fuck.  Jeez.  These Santa clauses really make little kids unhappy.  Dude.  Santa's a scary fuck. 
[00:28:30]  It is.  They're creepy, man.  He's got the big dumb beard.  He's dressed all in red.  No one dresses like that.  I think, I think a lot of these guys are, you know.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  It's a weird job to want, especially the younger ones that have a terrible fake beard.  Why would you want that job?  Yeah, why would you want to fucking sit there with screaming kids?  Right.  I don't know.  Why would you want to sit on Santa's lap?  Oh, I don't know.  Why would any boy want to do that?  Oh, no.  What is that?  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  Maybe I was just filming. 
[00:29:00]  You're on Santa's lap.  Yes, I am.  My daughter needed a diaper change.  I'm like, you know what?  Uh-oh.  Wait till after fucking the Santa thing.  Oh, no.  Just in case he's a fucking creep.  Sat on Santa's lap with a little duty diaper.  A little duty diaper.  Good.  Jeez.  That's why they charge you for the second package.  Yeah.  A little repellent.  They gave us a shitty kid.  I'm going to charge him twice.  Fuck that.  Let's say hi to Dom in Texas. 
[00:29:30]  Dom.  We were at Best Buy on Thursday, and there was probably three, four hundred people standing  outside.  And they come out of a side door, and they're like, okay, we're going to open the doors.  And about as soon as they said, open the doors, everybody started pushing.  They had these Star Trek doors that go to the side.  Right.  Everybody pushed those doors that came off the track, shattered on the ground.  Oh, doorbuster deals, they call them. 
[00:30:00]  See?  Literally.  Everybody started going in and pushed over a bunch of people that got cut up by all the  glass from them.  And we all have this in us, by the way, because we always wonder how long it would take for  all hell to break loose.  For society to break down.  If we lost electricity or something, it would be the Black Friday thing times ten.  Yep.  We'd all be in those fucking stores, you know, elbowing the shit out of people to get whatever  the fuck we can for our families.  At least that would be understandable, though, if we were getting water or some food. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  But the fact that we're just trying to get a fucking flat screen for the bathroom.  Exactly.  Just put animals.  The worst part of that, they've got, well, a few undesirables.  They'll get the little baby chair, just put their purse in it like they're, you know,  wrap it up like it's a baby, and then start screaming.  You see them two minutes inside the store, and they're walking around with an empty one  just loading shit up in it like it's a shopping cart.  Oh, how could they?  Give us a shit.  Give us a shit. 
[00:31:00]  Fuck them.  He hung up on that.  Fuck them.  Black Friday, if you just go any time of the day, you're good to go.  Yeah, it's when they first open those doors where you get fucked over.  Well, you've got to get the door buster deals.  Door buster deals.  They're called door buster deals, huh?  Yeah.  What kind of deals?  Oh, look out.  $35 PlayStation games.  $35.  How much are they normally?  These games, $50. 
[00:31:30]  So you're saving $15.  You're getting pushed through a play class window for $15?  Right.  That's crazy.  Or you get $8 Blu-ray movies.  Well, hold on.  Let's go back to the games.  You're trying to tell me that between now and Christmas, they're not going to be close  to $35 somewhere.  Yeah.  Somebody's going to say, fuck it, let's sell some games.  And the big gift this Christmas is PlayStation 4 anyway.  Right.  None of these games will work on it.  No.  Yeah, PlayStation 4.  That's a scumbag move.  Yeah.  People want to play their PlayStation 3 games, man. 
[00:32:00]  What the fuck are they doing?  All these games are going to be obsolete.  Like Jimmy just said, fucking, they just, they have to get you at every fucking turn.  Buy new games, fuckers.  Right.  That's what they're saying.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  So now you've got to, you know, buy the games twice, right?  Because you probably have a couple PlayStation 3 games you really enjoy, so now you've got  to get the version for the PlayStation 4.  The upgraded new version at full price.  That's just fucking horrible.  How much different is the PlayStation 4?  Like, is it that much better?  It's one better.  Of course it's that much better, especially if you're in the gaming world. 
[00:32:30]  I have a new Xbox I'm not using.  I'm trying to give it to my nephew.  It's an unopened, brand new Xbox.  Well, now they've upgraded the Xbox, so your nephew's going to be like, what, is this an  old Xbox?  No, it's probably from like six months ago, eight months ago.  That's old school.  Yeah, they got a brand new one.  You got a 360.  That's like a new game.  I'll give him that old piece of shit.  That's that whack shit.  There you go, Nick.  Knock yourself out.  Don't fucking smash my face with it.  Thanks, faggot uncle.  Oh, thanks, Uncle Jimmy.  That's great.  Thanks, Uncle Yesterday. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  You can save $150 on a MacBook.  Oh, yeah?  How much are they?  That's a lot, though, if you've got no fucking money.  I guess, but they're like $1,500, $1,600 anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't afford to begin with.  I mean, what do you want?  You shouldn't be buying it anyway.  Does Apple not have sales, though, right?  Apple does not push the stores?  They were given $50 to $100 gift cards on a bunch of stuff on Friday. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  But that was it.  Like, if you bought an iPad Air, you get a $50 gift card.  Right.  You got to buy something else there.  Right.  That's a good gift card, though.  Fucking Apple gift card everyone likes.  That's a great gift.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You gave me one.  It's still sitting on my dresser.  You know what I mean?  I got to use it.  Yeah, you probably should.  Now, look at one of those.  Probably.  I want to.  It was more than $50.  Sam, are you ready to do some research?  Yes.  Look at one of those TVs and the sale price.  Now, go somewhere else online.  Go where you can buy it online and see what it would cost. 
[00:34:00]  You can just go there.  Well, where is that sale for that TV?  Yeah, where was that?  That was Best Buy on Black Friday.  Best Buy on Black Friday.  Best Buy on Black Friday.  Okay.  All right.  Now, we'll see if you could just go online and get one for pretty much the same fucking  price.  Okay.  Let's see.  I like this investigative journalism we're doing here.  That's a good bit.  We're like fucking.  I feel like Cronkite.  Yes.  Good bit.  That's amazing. 
[00:34:30]  Are you kidding me?  Do we have a little research?  I just want to see how stupid people are.  I hope it's cheaper online.  Anybody who fucking went and got a deal and got injured for no reason.  Yes.  Okay.  You can get it on Amazon right now for $12.97.  Yeah.  Okay.  On Friday, the TV costs, with the Black Friday's savings, if you got there for the  door buster.  Right.  $12.97. 
[00:35:00]  So these shitheads are trampling each other when they could just order it online?  Order online.  It comes right to your fucking door.  And they're going to drop it off with a fucking droid.  How cool is that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  That's a bullshit story, right?  They can't have droids in the sky delivering their Amazon packages, like they're saying.  It wouldn't be practical, I don't think, to have them.  How cool would that be to look up in the sky and just see droids all over the place?  They're all over.  Delivering stuff.  I bet you'll sooner be able to just order something and print it in your house before 
[00:35:30]  they'll be a droid.  Ooh, printers.  Those 3D printers, once everybody has those, which we all will someday, you'll just order  something and print it.  But here's...  That'd be amazing.  I'd like some bakala, please.  Bakala.  Terrible example guy.  It says, save $402, but the TVs are never the actual list price.  That's why it's called Best Buy.  It's always on sale.  Best Buy is going to go bust, right?  Yeah.  Do you think...  I don't know.  They seem to be doing okay with their electronics.  They're doing okay. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  It's the movies, the companies.  Oh, here's the Amazon thing.  Vail giant Amazon has unveiled.  Chief business correspondent and drone expert, well, she is today.  Christine Romans is here with more.  It feels a little pie in the sky, but Amazon...  Ah, the fat broad said pie in the sky.  I'm just saying, I didn't show five.  He says, for five years, and he says, this is a research and development project, but  he wants to make it happen.  It's like a domino pizza dropping out of the sky for you, right?  At 30 minutes or less, you would buy something on Amazon, it would get in that little yellow  box, it would go in that little drone, and it would come to your doorstep if you live 
[00:36:30]  within 10 miles of one of their warehouses or their fulfillment centers.  Look, they have 34 of those fulfillment centers around the country.  By estimate, maybe two million packages a day.  Even if they did a quarter of their traffic by drone, you would have a sky full of little  black bugs dropping stuff out.  That would be cool.  Now, I was asking people this morning...  People would grab them, break them, some kid would get his eye taken out.  Please, it would never happen.  All negative comments so far.  People say privacy issues.  All three of them.  Air traffic.  Privacy.  Was the package looking at you fucking lights through the window? 
[00:37:00]  This sounds a little Orwellian.  What are the bugs that come?  Locus.  The, yeah, what do they call it?  Crabs.  Headlights.  Birds.  Birds.  Ciccadus.  Birds.  Crabbs.  Crabbs.  Beyond the fascination of, I mean, if he could actually pull this off, what does this mean  for business?  It sounds like it would be yet another game changer, which Amazon already is.  What are the...  Talk about the impulse purchase, right?  I mean, you could be sitting there and you could have something and you could have...  Can they do return?  I know.  Please wait 10 minutes while I make sure it fits, right?  Oh, I love their banter.  It really is horrific. 
[00:37:30]  In 2012, you've had commercial use of drones has been legally allowed.  Well, what bothers me...  Anytime soon.  What bothers me about the media, once again, I know, but it's one of our things we focus  on.  Why don't they use the other...  Why don't they say the other part of the story where Amazon figured out a way to get  everyone talking about them today?  That's pretty much it.  Because the odds of this actually happening are so slim.  Yeah.  Right?  By 2015.  There's no way because...  The safety concerns are the biggest thing.  Like, we're such a litigious fucking people as it is. 
[00:38:00]  Could you see that thing falling out of the sky and hitting somebody or their car?  And of course you've got opportunities that are going to figure out...  They're going to get big nets and they're going to be on the rooftops.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just going to be swatting at these fucking droids.  To get the goods, yes.  It's an old woman trying to get into an apartment building and a propeller from a drone just  levels her in the back of the head.  Yeah.  Not to put cameras on them to prevent thievery and then the privacy issues will get brought  up again.  Oh, then the privacy issue. 
[00:38:30]  That's the problem.  Well, we're going to lose the privacy issue.  Yeah.  Technology is going to take care of that.  You can't...  You're not going to be able to hold back the technology.  We're already...  Like, what's the difference between having one of these that's flying around or the multitude  of cameras that are already on you out on the street?  Right.  Just because it's connected to a pole outside doesn't make it any less intrusive.  Let's go to Brian in North Carolina.  He used to work at Best Buy.  He's got some Black Friday knowledge for us.  He's fired for rape.  Jesus.  Some terrible story. 
[00:39:00]  Brian, what's up?  All you fucking cockbags.  These assholes, they would start camping out Tuesday, usually, for the Black Friday.  So they would set up their tents outside of the store.  They would ruin their Thanksgiving, sit there for three nights.  We asked to do it in line a couple years ago.  The very first guy, we said, what are you even waiting for?  He said, I don't know.  My wife just told me to camp.  Apple 5?  He was just told to camp out.  He was told to camp out by his wife.  Jesus.  That's all he knew. 
[00:39:30]  That's a shitty wife.  That year, I don't know how she was.  She probably didn't even suck his dick or anything, either.  Wow.  Chippa.  Just ruining fucking Thanksgiving.  Well, that's what it is, too.  Like, half the people online, you just point them into, where's the deal?  And then you point them in this direction, and they buy whatever the deal is.  Just point them to the other side of the parking lot.  They'll probably walk over there to make sure you're not fucking goofing.  You're saying they would camp out just to save $50, Brian?  Yeah, because this particular year, there was this shitty laptop that was on sale for 
[00:40:00]  about $249.  Regular price on that one, I believe, was $279.99.  That was only about $20, $30.  And the TVs, and they're shitty technology.  The computers are usually outdated.  Right.  It's shit that you can only use if you just wanted to browse the web.  Right, yeah.  It's going to be good for anybody.  All that crap.  Yeah, yeah, people think they're getting a great deal.  You're all fucking sheep.  And then for the thing, the point that Sam had with the games, that shit usually lasted  all day, because they had thousands and thousands of those $35 games. 
[00:40:30]  You could go in at three in the afternoon and still get those fucking games.  Right.  Yeah, because no one wants them.  It's the whole reason they're on sale.  Right.  And none of the new stuff is on Black Friday, Boobusters.  Brian, some great insight.  Thank you.  Oh, amazing insight on the Black Friday phenomenon.  Amazing.  Did you see the end of the Auburn game?  No, I heard something happened.  That's all I heard.  I went to find a video. 
[00:41:00]  I couldn't find one.  You can't find the video?  No, but I was on the shitter, so I wouldn't take much time.  That was the only play I saw.  I was just flipping around, and I'm like, oh, field goal to win the game.  I'll check this out.  I'm not a huge college football fan, and that was the only play I saw.  What happened?  You don't know.  No.  Well, let me play this for you.  Oh, a little odd, Joe.  Well, the Auburn anchor just loses his fucking mind. 
[00:41:30]  Does he?  And then the other team had to call the same play locally.  Yeah.  You've got to be excited no matter what.  Even though your team is going to lose in a horrific way, how do you not get excited  at what you're seeing in front of your eyes?  I don't know.  I don't know if it's their team getting shit on.  The guy's trying to kick a field goal.  How far was the field goal?  50-something.  It was pretty far.  Yeah.  And then the guy runs it back for a touchdown. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, shit.  What, did he catch it?  Or did he get blocked?  Yeah.  He catches it.  Are you allowed to do that?  Yeah, obviously.  So if you miss, you can catch it and run it back.  Yeah.  And Alabama had, wait, here are the Auburn and Alabama.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So the first one, which one do you want to hear first?  The one that's really exciting.  The Auburn one.  All right.  Yeah, this is the point I'm trying to make.  Oh, this is the one with the, go full screen, too.  God damn you.  All right.  Good goal.  56 yarder. 
[00:42:30]  Okay.  And it stays inbounds.  He'll run it out to the 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 45.  There goes Davis.  Oh, my God.  Davis is going to run it all the way back.  Auburn's going to win the football game.  Auburn's going to win the football game.  He ran the miss.  He'll go back.  He ran it back 109 yards.  They're not going to keep him off the field tonight.  Holy cow.  You guys really didn't see this over the weekend? 
[00:43:00]  No.  They've played this about 100 times.  That's amazing.  It was 109 yards, but officially it will be 100.  They don't keep track of it like in the NFL.  What was he doing back there?  Just in case.  I bet you when they kick it over X amount of yards, they have a receiver.  Yeah, just in case.  In most cases, you're not going to get that.  It's going to be over your head, and that's it.  How long was it?  56-yarder.  Oh, wow.  I think over 50, maybe.  They put someone back there.  Yeah.  And then Alabama has nothing but linemen on the field. 
[00:43:30]  Right, right.  You know, they don't need any of their fucking fast guys.  They just want their bruisers out there.  So once he got past the initial fucking line of guys, he's home free.  But then, you know, the Alabama guy also had the call.  And my point is, it sucks for Alabama, but you're seeing an amazing play that you're not going to see anytime soon.  And it's going down in history as one of the greatest, like, finishes ever.  And this is what you got.  We're going to show you from Eli. 
[00:44:00]  You heard what?  Auburn.  So, see, he's excited.  Like, here we go.  Our team's going to win this.  Uh-huh.  A little different. 
[00:44:30]  That wasn't amazing, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I thought that was going to be totally dead, but, you know.  I don't know, but I know you guys.  I don't understand you have to be professional.  Because wouldn't you be like, holy, what the?  Well, compared to the other guy.  Yeah, the other guy.  Auburn.  We're not my ball game.  Let's go to Eric in D.C.  Eric. 
[00:45:00]  I'm here.  What?  I'm here.  Oh, I know.  I say hi, Eric.  Good thing.  What's up, buddy?  Thank God for that.  Hey, yeah, there's more to this story.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Do tell.  Yeah.  Well, it was going to be an overtime.  They had the last play of the game, and the guy went out of bounds.  And the Alabama coach argued that there was one second left.  And I mean, it might have been a tenth of a second.  Right.  So he insisted on them getting to kick the field goal for the win.  Right. 
[00:45:30]  Oh.  He could have beaten them in overtime.  They were dominating the game.  Right.  But he insisted on them.  I don't know if they're dominating the game if it's a tie.  Yeah.  And by the way, if he insisted, doesn't he?  Dominating.  It's a tie.  You're right.  Because in the end, it's really about how many points you get on the scoreboard.  What?  Auburn only really had big play.  Alabama had really big play.  It was a joke, idiot.  I understand what that actually means, but it was just a dumb joke.  And also, how could the coach insist and make that so?  Right.  Coaches insist all the time.  He challenged the review and made them look at the clock. 
[00:46:00]  So they went and looked at the clock the exact moment that kid's foot hit out of bounds.  And he goes, we get one more second, we're going to win with a field goal.  All right.  So the coach was technically right, though.  Yeah.  I mean, you got to go for that every time.  Obviously, it didn't work out in his favor, but you want that opportunity.  That's a long field goal, though.  56?  Not for a lot of these college kids.  They're animals.  Anything else, Eric?  Happy Thanksgiving.  Yeah, or whatever.  It was all right.  It was nice.  My cheese wasn't a hit, which was a bummer, but... 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  That was your only responsibility.  I know.  You brought sweating cheese down from New York.  You brought nice cheese, too.  It was nice.  Nobody enjoyed it?  Not really.  Just sat there?  There was a ridiculous clam dip there that was unbelievable that you just spread on crackers.  Oh, everybody.  Oh, my God.  And then they had a taco salad dip.  You know that shit?  The sour cream and the flat.  Nobody liked your hard, blocky, plain Jane cheese?  Oh, I didn't like it.  I was bummed.  I know they brought out some kind of buffalo fucking chicken wing dip thing. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Fuck.  Dude, cheese just sat in the corner.  It did just sit there and start sweating.  Because cheese sweats when it's realizing it's not going to be eaten.  Yeah, it's nervous.  It's humiliated.  It starts getting nervous.  Don't get nervous.  What happens to cheese?  I know.  Leave it out for one lousy hour and it loses its fucking mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Relax.  It's going to be okay.  I need to be refrigerated.  Right.  Jesus.  What are you doing to me? 
[00:47:30]  I'm sweating.  Really?  That's nervous.  What the hell goes on with cheese?  Cheese isn't happy unless it's being eaten and spread.  When it just sits there, it's embarrassing.  It's humiliated.  Swiss cheese almost gets invisible within an hour.  What is that about?  Yeah.  I know.  It turns like fucking plasticky.  So, yeah.  We should break.  We got food.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, today's Jim Brewer Day.  I'm very excited.  He's here at 730, yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  Does he have to leave then fly?  Jim's doing a gig tonight in North Carolina. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's doing, or is it South Carolina?  The comedy's on in Charlotte, North Carolina tonight.  Tonight?  And then tomorrow is at the Atlanta punchline.  I guess he's doing one-nighters in clubs.  He's probably doing a bunch of them.  Wait, tonight, then tomorrow, then Wednesday, then Thursday?  He's working all week, all over the place.  One night at each club.  Jim can do that.  This is where Jim Brewer's going to be this week.  I'm just going to give the states.  He's going to be in North Carolina on Monday, today.  Then he's going to be in Atlanta tomorrow.  Then he's going to be in Tennessee on Wednesday.  Then he's going to be in Nashville on Thursday, giving out the cities.  And then Chattanooga. 
[00:48:30]  Chattanoogie!  So he's hanging out in Tennessee for a few.  A few out of the five days.  Wow.  Jesus.  All right.  Jim Brewer on the way.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, oh, I know, I know.  30 years ago.  He's been dead that long.  This was a big deal.  Oh, and you'd hear this on MTV.  You were like, well, no videos for half an hour.  Right.  Yeah.  This would knock out three videos.  Yeah.  Ola Ray, the beautiful black girl that he picked up.  The nice fucking hiney.  She was nice.  She had some nice juice in that hiney.  I liked at the beginning, though, the little acting part before the music even starts. 
[00:49:30]  Well, they're on a date.  They're on a date.  Very believable.  He gives her a fucking, what did he give her?  Gives her something and goes, now it's a fish shoe.  A fish shoe?  A fish shoe.  Did he really say that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now it's a fish shoe.  Now it's a trout sneaker.  I don't know.  I don't know.  So, this Lost Prophets guy.  Yeah, I mean.  I kind of didn't want to talk about this because I hate this creepy shit. 
[00:50:00]  It's getting harder and harder to like him.  Yeah, this guy.  Wow.  What was the big song by the Lost Prophets?  I actually liked this song.  Something about a train, I think.  What's the song, E-Rock?  Oh, boy.  Come on, E-Rock.  You should know this off the top of your head.  I actually liked this one song, but.  I don't know any of their music.  I don't know.  There's no real reason why you should, but you might know this one song.  This guy is just despicable. 
[00:50:30]  Wow.  Yeah, he's a real piece of shit.  But he's looking for it, so give him a break.  Lost Prophets lead singer allegedly abused hundreds of children.  Hundreds of children.  How did he get away with this for so long?  I don't know.  You don't have the song?  They probably wiped it out.  Yeah, it's Last Train Home.  Yeah, Last Train Home.  Okay.  They also had one or two other songs that were.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I've heard this.  Wake Up and.  Oh, that picture's not good. 
[00:51:00]  That's one you wouldn't know.  I don't know if he was abusing people in the hospital, but he was.  I got the story here.  I just want to hear a piece of this.  A lot of people know this song.  Well, his band is fucked, too.  They're like, they're really, they're like.  Can we find a new singer, please?  No, they just broke up.  They'll be changing.  They'll probably just come back together and get a new singer. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  This is quite generic.  They all go to different bands.  Yeah, maybe.  Quite generic horse shit.  Yeah.  Was this the hit?  They had a couple others, but.  Do you know Shinobi vs. Dragon?  No.  Okay.  What's this one?  But he.  He had a.  Oh, this is a really big song.  Yeah.  This guy.  Lost Prophets rocker Ian Watkins was a drug-addicted pedophile  who abused hundreds of kids during his years as a rock star. 
[00:52:00]  His ex-lover has claimed.  Gee.  What's her issue?  Nah.  If she knew all this shit was going on.  Well, she had been going to the police for years.  So what the fuck were the police doing?  Nothing.  Joanne, who's 38, said the sicko singer, who this week admitted trying to rape a tiny baby.  11-month-old, yeah.  Used his band's world tours to have sex with underage fans.  She claimed she even went to cops in the Star's native South Wales to complain about his depraved actions. 
[00:52:30]  But police dismissed her fears and took no action.  She had.  He was, I guess, fantasizing with her and being a real pig.  And she might be a jilted lover at one point.  But she went and told the cops.  And they didn't do anything.  And I think that there was photos that went back and forth.  Because they didn't talk for a while.  And then she went and apologized to him.  Because she felt bad that she, like, I almost ruined his career.  And then he started up with it again. 
[00:53:00]  He started showing her pictures again.  And then she went to see him in L.A.  And she thinks he stole her BlackBerry probably to get rid of the images.  I was reading a whole bunch of shit on it last night.  Wow.  It's really fucking amazing.  But you didn't see that last minute play by Auburn.  But you're all in on this one.  Well, yeah.  I feel this is a bit more newsworthy than some guy running with a fucking blown up ball.  The kid fucker is definitely more compelling.  I said to the police, there's hundreds of victims out there.  And you're never going to find them.  Because the mothers are in on it. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  What the fuck?  How does that happen?  What?  How young were the victims?  I don't know exactly.  I know what happened.  What do you mean the mothers were in on it?  He said, not guilty.  I didn't do it.  This is bullshit.  And then apparently they hacked his iCloud.  Which I think is where they found a video or something.  And there was a lot of hardcore, disgusting images of child porn.  I think he got accused of making some child porn.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's scary enough to think about what's on your hard drive. 
[00:54:00]  Why would you have this shit floating around in the clouds?  But it's a cloud.  That's crazy.  I'm guessing he didn't know.  At least you feel like with that hard drive in your computer, you're like, okay, it's all self-contained right here.  I could always tie a rock to it and throw it in the ocean.  In the river or something.  And we'll have it floating in an iCloud.  That's nuts.  Just up there.  It's hard to walk by the police with a rock around your iPad when they're knocking on your door.  Excuse me?  I'll be right back.  I'll bet he didn't know.  I'll bet you that he didn't, wasn't aware of the backup stuff. 
[00:54:30]  Because I know somebody else whose iCloud got hacked through their iTunes or whatever.  Wow.  And the police finally got a hacker to get through.  And they found, I guess, a very...  That's, I think, where the baby rape attempt allegation came from.  Jesus Christ.  Is that...  I guess they have video.  I'm guessing.  A, how do you do that?  And B, how do you live with yourself after you do something so horrific like that?  That's unbelievable.  I don't think they think of that shit.  At all, right? 
[00:55:00]  Like serial killers or anything else.  His charity work made him an ambassador for young people by the Kidney Whales Foundation in 2008.  He's since been stripped of that title.  Oh.  So.  He was also...  One of the headlines was that he would fantasize about fucking kidnapping and killing children.  That's just wonderful.  That was, uh, that's the latest.  That's lovely.  He denied charges that he raped the 11-month-old child, but admitted to the two counts of attempted rape. 
[00:55:30]  Jesus.  I'm guessing they found the picture of him attempting and couldn't...  That's, again, pure speculation.  Oh, my God.  Whose baby was this?  Some woman.  She was being convicted.  They don't release the names in England.  The woman is that big of a fan where she goes, here, have at it with my baby?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  So her and another mother, I guess for another kid, both...  And someone, girl, got in trouble for tweeting their names in England.  That's like a crime in England to name victims, so you can't name the mothers because the victims are related.  Hmm.  So the mothers are kind of going to jail, but they haven't been named publicly. 
[00:56:00]  Uh, the musician also admitted to sexually assaulting at least one child under the age of 13,  aiding and abetting a female unnamed co-defendant to sexually assaulting a child under age 13,  and conspiring to rape a child under the age of 13.  Fucking guy is really fucked up.  Two women aged 21 and 24 have also admitted a string of sex offenses.  So that possibly would be the mob. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Probably.  In cahoots, as they say.  Lost profits.  They formed in 97, sold more than 3.5 million records.  They said he would do, like, coke and crystal meth and heroin, like, and just some fucking drug-fueled craziness,  but even drugs don't make you do that shit.  What is that?  He was raped as a kid?  I don't know, man.  This is how he gets off?  Like, how does your brain get so fucked up?  There's got to be something in the upbringing.  And start misfiring like that.  I don't know.  Like, I don't get it at all.  Like, what, I can't, in my worst day, imagine what the attraction to that shit is. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, my God.  It's so beyond anything relatable, sexual.  Or animal.  There was some hardcore animal porn he had, too, and it's like, I don't understand the fucking  attraction of that.  Like, how do you come to that?  How do you look at that and go, like, ooh.  Yeah.  The animal stuff.  Yeah, any of it.  You look at it, because it's silly.  The animal shit is funny.  No, but I mean when you're jerking.  Like, you know what I mean?  Right, right.  Like, we watched the fucking guy in Seattle get fucked to death, and that was a home run. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  A home run.  But what a fucking...  He's getting sentenced, like, December 18th.  So the case is already over?  He pled guilty.  I think once they hacked the iCloud, once it was indisputable, he's like, I'm done.  Because he doesn't want more shit to come out, probably, right?  Yeah, or just a trial where the images become...  I don't know.  I mean, the images probably wouldn't be public, but...  So what does he get?  I'm gonna...  I have no idea what their sentencing standards are.  But I'm gonna guess 40 years, 30 years.  He's in jail forever. 
[00:58:00]  Or does he get out half that time?  Because he's a relatively young guy, right?  I guess he's in his 30s.  He's trying to fuck an infant.  That's a big, big...  Well, I hope so.  I hope that's a big deal.  No one's gonna...  You never fucking know.  There's a story...  Sympathize.  Speaking of a big deal.  Remember the nanny when we were in Boston?  Yeah, I remember her.  1997-ish.  Yeah.  Me and Ann were doing radio up there when that whole fucking thing went down.  A 19-year-old nanny from England was over in Boston, you know, schooling or whatever the fuck. 
[00:58:30]  And she shakes a baby to death.  And she's now living in England in a small town somewhere.  And she's having her own child.  She's 35 years old now.  And it turns out she barely did any time for that.  Less than a year.  Less than a year.  It was like 200 and...  I want to say like 78 days.  That's all she got.  For killing someone's baby in the end.  That's all she got.  I thought you meant the other nanny that was cut in half and left in the dumpster.  Oh, God.  I know where that dumpster was, too.  Never happened at that.  You look at that dumpster to this day, it's creepy. 
[00:59:00]  It's still there.  Why is like...  And you know they just hosed it down.  Oh, of course.  Never got a new one.  They never caught that.  Whoever did that.  Oh, you know.  Yeah.  Ixnay.  Oh, right.  We know some people.  Ixnay.  Ixnay.  Inside job.  Ixnay.  Cops.  Ixnay.  Might know some people.  Ixnay.  Oh, boy.  It's been some strong rumors up there for many years.  Ixnay. 
[00:59:30]  This stuff...  What is this guy saying?  Bill in Michigan.  Go ahead.  Hey, I'm a child protective services worker for...  The state of Michigan.  And I'll tell you what.  This stuff goes on way more than what you want to know.  Parents sexually abusing their kids.  And what we get quite a bit, too, is these scumbag mothers of children that have registered sex offenders move in with them. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  I've heard about that.  We have to go out and warn the mother.  It's like, hey, you know, Johnny's swinging dick here.  Your new boyfriend is a registered sex offender.  And, you know, we tell them about having to hold them accountable and stuff like that.  But I've never found a mother yet that didn't already know her new boyfriend was a sex offender.  Yet they still allow these registered sex offenders to run their kids.  It's crazy.  It's unequivocally crazy.  And I know Hope is a little freaked out about it. 
[01:00:30]  I mean, I've been doing this for 17 years.  And I think most people are freaked out by it, by the way.  Of course, I've got two young kids right now.  So it's way on my radar.  Well, and I'll tell you what.  I mean, we only investigate the ones where it's parents or guardian or, you know, something very...  There's a relationship between them.  We don't even get involved with the ones where there's no relationship between the child victim and the perpetrator. 
[01:01:00]  That's law enforcement only.  And they probably do probably twice the amount of number we do.  It's sickening, you know.  And you do this for long enough.  And I hate to say it, you get numb after a while, but...  How do you get...  I don't understand how you could stay in that profession after a while.  Well, how good?  I know you're saying you get numb by it, but wow.  Because you're helping some people, too?  Like you are saving some kids from that fate?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, that's exactly...  I've heard, you know, from some of my co-workers who were the foster care worker 
[01:01:30]  after I pass it on to them, you know, and I've gotten secondhand, you know,  hey, who removed me, you know, down the road?  You know, tell them I said thanks.  You know, you do get that small bit of...  So you get some small victories.  Yeah.  But I'm not in it.  You know, I'm not in it for accolades, you know.  You're in it for the paycheck.  I didn't say that, man.  Yeah, but I'll tell you what.  I did law enforcement for five years before I went to this, and I've had cops tell me,  you know, how the hell can you do this? 
[01:02:00]  You know, the serious, you know, stuff.  And it's like, well, it's simple, you know.  Unlike you being 24-7, I'm now essentially Monday through Friday, 8 to 5, weekend holidays  off.  I got to work after hours.  It's overtime.  You know, and I said, you know, and I always usually get them with me.  I'm not worried about getting shot walking up to a house or a car like preferably you  are.  And I usually get the, you get a pony type of thing.  So, you know, it's sickening, you know, but it's there, and it's the reality that people 
[01:02:30]  in society don't understand sometimes.  So, you know.  Well, that's why I just lock myself in my house.  I turn a blind eye to the whole thing.  Like, and you have lots of guns, yeah.  Exactly.  All right, Bill.  Thank you for the insight.  All right, Billy.  Be good.  Yeah.  There goes Bill.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Happy holidays.  Happy holidays.  Happy holidays as the children are being raped. 
[01:03:00]  That's wonderful.  Jesus Christ.  Let's see what jail justice is like.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's just see.  I don't know, man.  I think you should be able to execute a guy that is attempting to rape an 11-month-old.  Absolutely.  Definitely.  Absolutely.  You should be able to kill him.  Absolutely.  Especially this photographic or video proof.  It's not just he said, she said, but the mother.  Right, right.  If there's proof, like visual proof, and you see him holding an infant down and trying to  fuck it, the state should be able to kill you. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Because you have zero value to the rest of us.  Zero.  Of course.  All right.  That was frightening.  That was a downer.  It happens.  You know.  They're horrible people.  In more uplifting news, Paul Walker.  Oh, boy.  I'm not laughing at this.  I'm not laughing at Paul Walker and what happened, but I don't know.  A little bit of a car wreck. 
[01:04:00]  A little bit.  Leaving a charity event.  Yeah.  A lot of it, actually.  I guess.  And they're starting to say that speed was a factor, everyone.  Yes.  Speed was a factor.  Speed was a factor.  Really?  As was the car bursting into flames and burning them both beyond recognition.  There's a picture going around out there.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  No way.  Mm-hmm.  God.  Of them dead?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, gosh.  I chose not to click.  Those pictures just fucking turn up.  It's amazing. 
[01:04:30]  A lot of our listeners are trying to turn us on to the picture.  I guess a French newspaper, I think it was.  Uh-huh.  Actually posted it online.  Yeah.  And then quickly removed it.  But, of course, anything that's up for a few seconds, people grab it.  Ah, yeah.  So now people have it.  Yeah.  And it's kind of becoming that thing.  Hey, man, you want to see?  Check it out.  Were they just burnt?  I didn't.  I just don't want to click on it.  Yeah, there was something in dental records.  Right.  They had to it.  Wow.  That car is fucked.  That's demolished. 
[01:05:00]  How fast do you think they were going?  Uh, boy, hard to tell from the burnt car picture.  I know.  And it hit that tiny little fucking tree.  That was it, huh?  The pole, too, though.  There was a pole.  Was there a pole?  Yeah, I think so.  They went through?  Enough to...  Because there's some piece of metal...  Oh, that's the...  Forget it.  Enough to set it on fire.  I think it was just that tree.  I really think it was just that small tree.  Wow.  Yeah.  I was thinking they would cut that fucking tree right in half.  They were going pretty fast.  Yeah.  So, that's just horrible news. 
[01:05:30]  What was he?  He was just in all the...  Fast and Furious.  He was in Varsity Blues, right?  Oh, yeah.  He was in a few others.  I honestly didn't know who he was.  Somebody told me...  I mentioned his name on Twitter.  I realized I haven't seen any of his names.  He was a pretty big deal.  Yeah, no, apparently so.  I just didn't know his name.  40 years old.  And he wasn't driving.  What, he had like a race...  Race car buddy.  Race car buddy.  Oh, boy.  Ex-race car driver.  Great.  Jumped into...  What kind of car was it?  It was either a Ferrari or a Porsche. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Something like that.  It was hard to come.  A super fast one.  Yes.  I don't like that fast car shit.  I have no problem admitting I'm a fucking pussy when it comes to that shit.  No problem.  I was always the guy fucking bumming everyone out when we were in a car full of guys with  one guy driving 90 miles an hour, drinking a beer with one fucking hand.  And I'd be the pussy basically saying, stop the car.  Slow it out.  I'm getting the fuck out.  Drive like a maniac. 
[01:06:30]  Never had the balls for that, ever.  Yeah.  You get up there.  Oh, yeah.  But never with anybody else in the car.  I mean, I...  I didn't...  I hated being in a car when someone else was driving fast.  Yep.  I don't like that at all.  I don't like anyone else driving at this point.  Yeah, that's true.  I drive every single chance I get.  Every chance I get, I'd rather drive.  And then, you know, we tell the story.  We got those Lexuses...  Oh, yes.  Back in the day.  And I went over 100 on the Long Island Expressway just to see how it feels. 
[01:07:00]  And I was like, okay.  Did it.  That's it.  Never again.  Yeah.  And I was scared shitless.  At 100...  Maybe it was like 103-ish, 105.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  But I was like, all right.  Open road.  Let me see.  Let me go up to 100 in this fucking thing.  And it was no fun for me.  Shit happens very quickly at that speed.  You see shit flying by.  It's just...  Oh, and I did it for like...  Like, I was...  You know, a split second.  As soon as it basically just hit over 100, I was like, all right. 
[01:07:30]  Right back down to 65 or whatever the fuck.  Don.  I don't...  I just...  But there's a lot of guys that enjoy that.  But now they got him in Fast and Furious 7.  Uh-oh.  Which they've already filmed.  Oh, no.  At least they started.  But he dies in a car wreck.  Why?  Oh, boy.  Brewer's here.  So why don't we take a break.  Oh.  And clear the field for Jim Brewer.  Nice.  All right.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:08:00]  Sirius X.  Sirius X.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The guys are back from the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  Fuck yeah.  Jim Brewer in studio.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy looks ridiculous.  Thanks, Jimmy.  He's losing weight.  Oh, my God.  He's still not happy, though.  No, I'm happy.  He was pinching something earlier. 
[01:08:30]  You know what?  Look at him.  He's on my helmet.  Yeah.  I got some I want to lose.  And I'm like, can I not lose this last bit?  There's always going to be something you're going to pinch.  Yeah, but I want to lose.  There's enough here where I can look at it and go, nah, I need to really...  Lipo.  Do the liposuction.  No.  I don't know if I want to do that, though.  I don't know if I want to do that, though.  I don't know if I want to do that.  You know what, too?  Like, the way Jimmy looks, you get a different confidence when you look like that.  He's got a swag.  He's got a man face now.  He's got a man face.  I want to be a boy, Jimmy.  He almost has a jawline. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Almost.  He had a little baby face.  A little chiseled look, man.  I want to be a boy.  We already are, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah, good for you, Hammer.  Thanks, buddy.  Nice.  I just caught up with Jim Brewer.  He's got a lot going on.  Oh, yeah.  His parents are still doing well.  My father's 90.  90 days.  He lives in Florida.  He lives in my house.  Thinks it's 1947.  Oh, shit. 
[01:09:30]  And he thinks he's in Florida.  Right.  That's beautiful.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, my God.  So, he's good.  His dementia can't be that bad.  If you could turn into living in a very cool year in a state you like.  Right.  He'll tell you anything about the war.  Right.  He'll tell you anything about the war and the time he went to a whorehouse.  He'll tell you anything about that.  But yesterday and whose kids are?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not really sure about that.  Oh, man.  Does he have a hard time with the technology?  Like, if you show him an iPad, does he realize, like, wow.  Oh, he doesn't know what the hell that is. 
[01:10:00]  No, but if you show him that, does he go, like, wow, this couldn't be 1947 or is there  any?  No.  Oh, not even.  But the brain is weird.  Like, he remembers everything from the war.  And that's probably completely accurate, too.  Oh, he's dead accurate.  And then he woke up.  There was a stretcher where he woke up and I videotaped her.  I put it on Facebook a couple weeks ago where he thought he was a movie.  He said, I don't know.  He wakes up because he's in the hospital bed.  And he'd go there.  He'd go, morning, Dad.  He's like, I'm in the movies.  Holy shit.  You're in the movies? 
[01:10:30]  Who are you in the movie with?  He goes, Shirley Temple.  I said, you're kidding.  Are you filming this week?  Because you're in Atlantic City.  So what are you filming?  He goes, I can't tell you.  It's a secret.  I said, all right.  How much are they paying you?  $800.  All right.  All right.  Sounds good.  What the fuck?  I hope I'm in that fucking world.  Wow.  Your art looks great on it, though.  Do you ever get bummed out or depressed?  No, I really don't. 
[01:11:00]  No, he's 90.  Good for you, man.  It's 30.  Every day is 90.  Right?  Yeah.  It's like, fuck it, man.  It's not like he's going to protect me from a bunch of bullies.  Like, those days are over.  Right, yeah, yeah.  It's not like he's going to give me advice about anything.  It's over.  Who cares?  Wow.  It's like having an awesome two-year-old kid hanging out.  Right.  Holy shit.  How's your mom?  How's your mom?  Oh, much better.  That's another ep.  We had a couple epics on here.  By the way, sorry to interrupt you.  Are you filming your dad?  Like, are you talking about your documentary or whatever? 
[01:11:30]  No.  Because it's real.  I started to.  And it's more depressing now.  Oh.  So it's more of.  I mean, if you want to hear it.  It's more.  A lot of cleaning.  Oh, boy.  And their ass is literally.  His ass is like an elephant ass.  So you have to, like, spread it.  I mean, it's just layers of layers of old skin.  Oh, wow.  So yeah.  Yeah.  It's just like, here I am.  I'm going to be cleaning my dad.  With the hose.  So it's.  It's not really.  Wow. 
[01:12:00]  Like the other one, he was alert.  And I could bust his balls and all that.  Where here, he's.  He's not really.  It's different.  He just says, yeah, a lot.  Yeah.  Are the conversations worth filming?  Like, not that part.  But like, is there anything in that that would be uplifting or helpful to people?  Because I think that's fascinating.  The shit that you've already filmed.  The documentary was great.  No, no, no, it was.  And I think I got pretty much everything I could have got.  Where.  And I keep.  I keep hearing you over and over.  You know, start filming him again.  Start filming him again. 
[01:12:30]  And I don't.  I really don't know, Jimmy.  If there's.  Maybe there's something there.  If there's enough there.  What you would see is just.  Yeah.  Like, all right.  I'm getting him out of bed.  And then I could.  The only thing he remembers is.  What happened in 1945?  Ah, I went in and Japanese.  And I shipped out of Seattle.  And then.  And then I had leave for two weeks in Australia.  Oh, my God.  I got a cat house.  I got crabs.  And that's true. 
[01:13:00]  That's the most.  The most entertaining thing he'll do.  Yeah.  And it's hard to capture.  Is people come up to him.  Like on Thanksgiving.  And they want to talk to him.  They sit down.  Like, hey.  James.  What's this guy?  Oh, my.  This guy said he's working at the.  I'm working the Statue of Liberty.  You know.  You know.  It's about America.  And blah, blah, blah.  And he kind of lured him in.  And he goes.  I don't give a shit. 
[01:13:30]  That would be funny.  But if I.  They're so far and few.  Right.  I'd have to have a camera on him 24-7.  But also the contrast between what you filmed already.  That was in the documentary.  And what's going on now.  Could be.  It could be.  Obviously it would be depressing.  But kind of.  I think it's helpful.  People don't know what to do.  Right.  They don't know what to do.  You seem to be handling it better than most.  Which is kind of what I'm saying.  Like.  You seem to be doing a dignified great job with it.  And saying.  Hey.  This is what it is.  And this is how you deal with it. 
[01:14:00]  And.  That's pretty impressive, man.  I learned it from watching elephants.  Not so cheap graphic.  Elephants.  Elephants.  The old elephant legs behind.  If the lions don't get him.  The other ones push him along.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And shit just drifts down his leg.  And they stick him in a mud hole.  And that's it.  They move along.  And they're dead.  Is he still happy in his own way?  Yeah.  As long as they're eating.  Right.  As long as they want to eat.  He'll wake up every day and go.  I'm hungry.  Are there times you feed them certain things. 
[01:14:30]  Knowing that you have to take care of it on the other end?  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  Like Thanksgiving.  Like no chicken wings.  Or.  No.  Thanksgiving.  I had a huge fight with my wife.  Because she said.  You got to give him fruit.  Because I have.  I have a nurse that helps out.  Nurse wasn't there Thanksgiving.  So I take him all day.  No problem.  It's 30 people over the house.  And she's like.  You know.  He eats fruit every morning.  So I'm not giving him fruit.  So I'm not giving him fruit.  Because when we give fruit.  Two hours later.  It's splat.  I'm not cleaning that up today.  Oh God.  I want to enjoy my. 
[01:15:00]  I want to enjoy my.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  My stuffing.  I want to enjoy some nice gravy.  And I don't.  I don't want this.  Nice potatoes.  Gets in your fingernails.  Oh my.  Put a bunch of gloves on.  Oh.  I do put gloves on.  I do.  All the way up to my.  All the way up to my freaking.  My elbow.  I get gloves.  Man.  But yeah.  Yeah.  If I have them.  It's a very strict diet.  See.  Cleaning up after my kids.  It's starting to get rough.  Because it's starting to smell.  Like real shit.  Oh yeah.  I can't imagine doing it with a fucking parent. 
[01:15:30]  No.  They're a buck 80.  Buck 80 pounds.  Eating.  Celery.  And meat.  And eggs.  Just pouncing off.  Shit.  Then they're in that.  Then they're in the old tubes.  Right.  Half of them are already.  They've got dead meat in there for 30 years.  Then comes out.  So you're scraping some of that off the walls.  Before it comes out.  He doesn't go very solid.  It's like bad elephant.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  So wait.  Will he get out of bed to eat?  Or is he in bed all the time?  Oh no. 
[01:16:00]  We've got to get him.  We get him out of bed.  But we've got to.  Can he walk around on his own?  No.  No.  No walkers or anything?  As a matter of fact.  A walker for about.  Five feet?  Yeah.  Maybe 20, 30 feet.  Okay.  And then it's all wheelchair.  Right.  And then there's a little staircase.  Five stairs.  I've got to get him up and down.  How?  How do you do that?  He can.  He grab his ass.  And he grabs.  And he grabs.  And he grab one of his.  Under his shoulders.  And you just kind of push him upwards.  And then the other tricky thing is when they're older too. 
[01:16:30]  They take this medicine.  So if you.  If you squeeze too hard.  Oh man.  You literally rip their skin open.  Yeah.  Like literally just.  I totally get all that.  Gauge is open.  So you've got to be careful the way you.  The skin is ridiculously paper thin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's weird.  That's what happened to my mom.  It's really weird.  So.  Does he ever make the bathroom on his own or no?  Like is it.  They just can't tell when he has to go?  Or once in a while can he sense it?  You've got to sit him down.  Like a kid.  You've got to sit.  Or like a dog.  You've got to let him out.  So.  What I'll do is. 
[01:17:00]  Wow.  Do you have a schedule figured out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you kind of know like.  All right.  It's coming soon.  So.  Absolutely.  Instead of having him make it in his pants.  I'll hopefully get to a toilet.  Gotcha.  What you do is.  In the morning.  He has cereal.  He has bananas.  Then he has fruit.  Then he gets toast.  Then he gets cookies.  And then coffee.  Then we walk him.  Like three times around the island.  Wow.  He walks around the little kitchen island.  He's doing his little dance.  He stares out the window.  And he shakes his head.  And then.  And it's like.  All right.  Let's go downstairs. 
[01:17:30]  And sit on the toilet.  And then he sits on the toilet.  And just like a kid.  You go.  Did you go?  And he goes.  No.  Did you go yet?  No.  But you just got to wait for the smelly.  Oh.  All right.  And then that's.  Dude.  It's another thing.  If you really want to hear it.  He's too.  He.  He doesn't.  Like a real guy.  He can't tuck your donkey in.  You know.  When you sit down.  You tuck your.  You tuck your dick down.  Right.  And you sit.  He's not capable of doing that.  So I have to pad around.  His dick.  Because when he's.  When he's crapping.  He's peeing all over. 
[01:18:00]  Oh.  So I got to.  I got to put pads.  All over the floor.  And all over.  Like.  Literally tape it around his.  His sack.  And his legs.  Because it's just.  It's more cleaning.  Oh my God.  Why don't you get a bidet?  Well get one of those Japanese toilets with a bidet.  So you don't have to wipe them when he's on the toilet.  A bidet would do a great job.  I'm sure he's still got to wipe no matter what.  There's too many crevices like you were saying.  It's like elephant skin.  And.  When they.  If you want to hear it.  He.  He gets like a callus. 
[01:18:30]  On his butt cheeks.  When they get older.  Because they're sitting down so much.  So they have like this.  You have to constantly put cream in.  Lily.  When I go to the bathroom.  You have.  As he sits.  I have to spread his cheeks apart.  So there's a nice clear path.  Otherwise.  If you just sit him down.  It's the whole thing.  Yeah.  It'll get smeary.  It'll be smearing all over.  It's gloves.  What a good son though.  He's a good son.  He's amazing.  You know.  And his outlook on the whole thing is amazing.  I really have no problem.  Faintly. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  I make my kids watch.  And I want to make sure they're in line.  It's like.  Exactly.  Okay.  And how about mom?  I mean.  Mom lives in independent living.  Which I think.  On this show.  Is when.  The day she went in there.  Oh.  Right.  Right.  Remember when we called.  And you guys were.  I didn't feel good about that one.  Dude.  People.  Did I help you?  Weirded out by that one.  Did we help you?  Yeah.  You know what really helps?  I didn't feel good about that one.  I'll tell you what made me feel good about that day.  All right.  Somebody called in. 
[01:19:30]  And said.  While we were doing this whole thing.  You guys are pretending you're a therapist.  Someone called in and said.  Your mom has.  Abandonment issues.  And this is very normal.  They get angry.  They can get violent.  And.  It made a lot of sense.  Because her first husband.  Was killed in World War II.  A month before he was supposed to come home.  While she.  While she had his baby.  Then her father.  Died a year and a half later.  And then.  Her.  Other.  Uncle. 
[01:20:00]  Who was very close.  Died.  And then.  You know.  So yeah.  She's always had these.  The bitch.  She always resorts.  So like.  My father.  My first husband.  She would beat my dad.  Not like slapping around.  But.  You know.  My father would like watching war movies growing up.  And she's like.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Oh.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My husband's dead.  I don't like it.  You know.  She would sit there drinking.  Holy shit.  She would sit there.  He.  He's sitting there.  And she's in the other room. 
[01:20:30]  I'll be home for Christmas.  God damn Nazi son of a bitch.  So.  Yeah.  It was.  And your dad was never aware that maybe the war movies was not a good idea.  Oh.  That's all he.  He should have like switched to westerns or something.  That's all he knew.  Right.  That's all he knew.  And that was her.  Wow.  And that's what made her.  Plus that was his life too right?  He was like.  Yeah.  It's his life.  I mean.  But that's what got her going though.  You knew what you were getting into.  You had that drunken conversation one night before you slept with one another. 
[01:21:00]  I was in World War II.  My husband was dead.  Oh.  Oh.  Great.  Let's do this.  Let's pop out a kid.  Right.  I mean.  You know what you're investing in.  Mm-hmm.  So.  It's not like.  She knew what she was getting.  How old is she now?  87.  Wow.  I missed the old days.  She would come in with your sister at NEW and she'd be a trip.  My mother's funny still.  She's really funny.  She's a rip.  She's much better where she's at.  She's a different person.  Is she happy?  She's back to the NEW days.  Really?  Is she happy over there? 
[01:21:30]  She's a wise at.  Yeah.  She's very happy.  Good.  Do they miss each other?  She's got all her friends there.  You know what?  He doesn't miss her.  But.  And I don't know if he even knows her.  But she.  When she comes over now.  She has.  She sits with him the whole time.  Oh.  They do sit together.  Oh.  Okay.  She'll sit with him the whole time.  Wow.  But whenever.  She pays for his care.  I pay for her rent.  Where she lives.  And she pays for him. 
[01:22:00]  And.  You know.  Whenever it's paycheck time.  It's like.  You know.  The nurse gets a lot of money for doing it.  And then.  The mom.  Listen.  Take it down a level.  If you were in a nursing home.  Be ten times the amount.  This woman's a godsend.  Yeah.  They take care of our elderly.  Yes.  If you find a good place.  They're all right man.  It's very hard.  Yeah.  How do you know where to fuss on your mother?  That's scary.  You got to do some research. 
[01:22:30]  Because there are the places out there.  Where they pick up some horrific things with the nanny cam.  Oh my god.  Oh god.  Really?  Yeah.  Keep them out of bed.  The best places honestly are private care.  Right.  They're going to cost more money.  But you got to think.  Yeah.  You got to think like in the private school mentality.  If you go to a state run nursing home.  Oh forget it.  Oh boy.  Let me tell you something too.  I would have in and out Walmart trampoline clientele showing up to take care of my father. 
[01:23:00]  And they were a disaster.  They'd sit them on the toilet for three hours.  I had to get cameras.  They'd let them lay in bed and just piss for a while.  They'd show up at the house with an attitude.  Like I got to take care of.  So you got to go through a lot.  And if you start going to state run places and run by the government funded, those workers  don't care.  90% of them are horrible. 
[01:23:30]  So when you say private, do you mean home care or private?  Okay.  Like a home care nursing home or home care independent living.  You may pay more.  It's worth in the end because you know they're being taken care of.  They're private so they depend on your money.  Right.  They're not depending on the state.  They're not depending on.  You can't have a situation go down in their place is what you're saying.  We're going to see.  Yeah.  We take you under.  Because that would really fuck up the money coming in.  That's right.  People would yank their parents out of there.  Right.  What's the price difference between a state run one and a private one? 
[01:24:00]  Oh my God.  Just generalize it.  Night and day.  There's so many people that are probably listening right now that can't afford the private  care.  Right.  So they'd have to do the state.  They're both.  I don't think you're going to find either or for less than five grand a month.  Yeah.  That's about what we're paying for my mom.  It's probably five grand a month.  All right.  We're doing about five G's a month.  My mom's three and three for independent living.  So basically she's living in an apartment.  Right.  On her own.  And she gets, you know, a meal here and there.  Wait.  But it's in a home. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  It's one of those places.  But the door is all dressed up like it could possibly be her.  Yes.  Her real home.  Yes.  I know exactly what it's hard about.  Right.  And you go in the apartment.  It's like, oh, wow.  And she lives by herself.  There's no one in there.  Yeah.  But there's a front desk lady.  And there's.  Yeah.  We went from that to the next stage.  And then there's.  She's got to be watched at.  Watch a little more.  The lurking building.  A hundred yards away.  That's the.  That's where they send you.  You can't be independent anymore.  You're going down the hill. 
[01:25:00]  That's.  That's the.  Down the hill.  Down the hill you go.  Send it down the hill.  Where we sit you in the hallway.  And you just sit there.  And you're head cocked.  Oh, God.  Or the bad wing.  The bad wing.  Yeah.  Like that weird part of the high school.  Remember.  Harbour Fields.  That Ann talks about it, too.  That's strange.  Yeah, the back hall.  That.  You never really went down there.  You just knew some shit was going on.  Uh-huh.  And I think it like.  I think the lights were dimmer. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Everything just drastically changed.  It would take that right turn.  And it was the other section of the high school.  Teachers you only serve once in a while.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like, who the fuck is that?  Kids.  You're a teacher.  Yeah, exactly.  Teach that guy.  What are they teaching in this hallway?  What happened to Eddie Gonzalez?  He went down there and he never came out.  He never came out.  But 87 and still independent.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  So she goes on the field trips and all that.  She goes on the field trips and the dinners and this and that.  Wow.  And she has her happy hour every Friday.  Happy hour is from. 
[01:26:00]  Happy hour is from 4 to 7.  And you got to bring.  I mean, they give you two glasses of wine.  That's something else.  Oh, wow.  That's righteous.  Cheese and crackers.  Where's the happy hour?  In the place itself?  Yes.  Really?  And she says Lily like they try to hawk extra wine and it's great.  Is there sex going on?  There has to be.  That's what I'm asking.  It has to be, right?  There has to be.  There's definitely one creepy guy around. 
[01:26:30]  I want to say he's like in his 50s and he looks like a bizarre late 1970s, 80s bar hag.  I think I work with him.  Classic.  I think that's me.  Oh, wow.  But you look at him and he has the glasses that his eyes are expanded in him. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  And he's always sitting outside with a leather jacket smoking cigarettes.  Oh, no.  The cool guy.  How old do you think he is?  Ah, maybe 60?  Where the other ones are clearly high 70s and above.  Way over.  So I don't know if he's...  Wait, he's almost too young to be there.  Yeah, it's 55 and over, I think, or 60 and over.  But he's very suspect.  Oh, he's a resident?  Oh, I thought he was a worker.  There's maybe two suspect residents where you're like, nah, what's up with that? 
[01:27:30]  They're trying to get some pussy.  Oh, God.  You never know.  You never know.  You never know.  He's like, hey, you know, I can still drive.  Right.  I can...  Go out on a date.  Yeah, I can drive.  I can cook still.  You know how to work the microwave?  Man.  You never know.  So assisted living, you have access to a nurse.  Like, if you have a button or something, you hit it if there's a fucking problem.  Yeah, they pretty much leave you alone all day.  That's cool.  Pretty much.  They leave you alone all day.  But they have services right there, like a nurse's area and a little restaurant-y or 
[01:28:00]  cafeteria thing.  A common area to hang out in.  And a place to fucking go watch movies and, you know.  Like what Paulie Gautier's mother in fucking Soprano, like when the last season.  Yes.  Oh, God.  That's exactly it.  Yeah.  But it's a real room that looks like it's your home.  Yeah.  There's nothing hospital-y about it.  Right.  Unless your mind starts going and you've got to go down the hill.  Down the hill.  Where the lightning is.  The frightening little trip down the hill. 
[01:28:30]  And that's always the update.  Cheryl had to go down the hill.  Poor thing.  My mom does have great-  Does she talk about all the people that are dying?  Dying and certain ones.  I don't know if she doesn't take her meds.  The lady cross street from her says, if you go to her apartment, she has an  umbrella over her chair, over her lounge chair.  Oh, no.  Because she says at night they come out of the ceiling.  Oh, well, they'll do that.  And they-  What the fuck? 
[01:29:00]  They come out of the ceiling and they're trying to get her, but the umbrella stops them from  getting on her.  Yeah.  And what are they?  All right.  Not really the people.  Uh-huh.  And they're little people.  Uh-huh.  Wait, so-  All right.  Watch what I'm going to be right.  She's got the umbrella inside.  Yes.  Over her chair because that protects her from the people coming out of the ceiling.  It's got to be a hell of a way to live.  Right?  It bums us out, but I wonder if in your own head that it just all makes sense and it's  cool as fuck.  Yeah, right?  I guess so. 
[01:29:30]  I don't know.  I'm just wondering.  You might be scared of fucking people.  Imagine thinking that your umbrella is stopping people from attacking you.  Oh, my God.  That's a pretty horrible place.  That is frightening.  I could see if you were convinced that there was pussy on your chair and you kept grabbing  it.  But being afraid of the little people in the ceiling.  Yeah, yeah.  That's far out there.  That's rough.  We might all be there one day.  Yeah.  Which is really weird.  Fuck yeah.  Good Lord.  Good Lord.  So, and then, how's the daughters?  I'm trying to catch up with Brewer.  It's been a while.  They're really good.  The next... 
[01:30:00]  What are the ages again?  14.  I know you told me off air, but there's three people.  I'm trying to keep them from dating.  Right.  14, 11, and 8.  The 8-year-old is 8.  11-year-old is...  What does an 8-year-old do?  Let's go up the...  Mine is full-blown tomboy.  She's bowing arrows, cuts knives.  Wow.  Pocket knives, hangs out with boys.  She will not wear chick clothes at all. 
[01:30:30]  She's into rock.  That's pretty normal at that age, though, right?  Yeah.  She's into rock, metal.  She wears wrist metal stud plates now.  Really?  At 8?  I totally corrupted her.  That was funny.  What kind of music does she like?  She likes ACDC.  No kidding.  Yeah, she likes ACDC.  An 8-year-old.  Wow.  Yeah, you'd be surprised.  The 8-year-old, ACDC.  And then 11-year-old is...  She's, you know...  Katy Perry and blah, blah.  But the 14-year-old... 
[01:31:00]  That's a world that I guess I lived in.  They literally only exist in their world.  Nothing else exists.  And it's a lot...  This is minor, but social media is a big problem because she won't get her work done.  She'll sit there on a freaking iPad or whatever, like a junkie. 
[01:31:30]  And you give it to her, and she's like,  Ah!  Don't take it away from me!  Like, what are you doing?  I'm Snapchatting!  It's really bizarre.  And then, you know, and she's constantly showing you, like, Todd, Snapchat it.  It's funny.  All right.  Snapchatting.  It's exciting.  Disalienist Instagram?  So, we came up with this...  We came up with this rule, like, listen.  10 o'clock at night.  It's over.  Give me that thing. 
[01:32:00]  If you don't give it to me, I come in and take it.  Okay, okay.  Go in there, and she hides it under the bed.  So, while she's under the bed, you come in at, like, 10.30.  Like, what are you doing?  No, no, I'm sleeping.  You open up, and there she is with the...  Instagram.  And you go, give me that.  And then they don't...  They don't go...  My wife...  This is why I can't have guns in the house, because she would shoot one of them.  She really would.  Oh, my God.  She's got hormonal... 
[01:32:30]  She's a maniac with the...  I mean, she goes from zero to 140, and she just...  She takes off the door hinge, and she's like, yeah...  So, she walks in...  Oh, you've taken the door off?  Oh, yeah, all the time.  I've had that happen when I was a kid.  All the time.  Door's taken off.  Everything's unplugged.  She had to sleep in the living room for, like, a month, this kid.  So, she goes in there.  She's under the covers.  Are you on Instagram?  No.  Pull the covers away.  There she is, the thing. 
[01:33:00]  And the kid don't get it.  Instead of going, all right, sorry.  She puts her face...  She puts her hand out.  She goes, wait.  Just wait.  I'm not doing...  Just wait.  Oh, no.  And, you know, I'll cut your hair.  And I'm like, listen.  Meatball.  Just think of a bank robber.  I come in, and...  Okay, everyone, hands up.  You don't...  You don't go, wait.  Let me finish putting the money in the bag.  It's over.  You're caught. 
[01:33:30]  Put the money down.  Put your hands in the air.  Right, right.  You're done.  Put your face down on the ground.  There is no...  Hold on a second.  Just hold on.  I'm not done stealing.  So, it's...  Oh, my God.  You're doing a little...  I have to look forward to.  Yeah, have fun.  No, no dating.  Hey, listen.  No dating.  Uh-oh.  I don't care if...  What you say is you're no dating.  You're 14.  Well, so-and-so dating.  I don't care about so-and-so.  I wasn't allowed to date in high school.  My mom made it a major fucking issue. 
[01:34:00]  No dating.  They're too stupid.  They're 14.  I don't know what they're doing.  I don't know what they're doing.  She wants a date, though, huh?  Yeah, so...  I know something's going on.  Are her friends dating?  Ah, a couple of them, yeah.  That makes it tough, right?  They start at, like, 12.  So, then you have to deal with that shit.  Yes.  You have to start reading friends out.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You.  This one's out.  Just out.  Out.  I know this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, can I hang out with this family?  No.  No.  It's over.  It's over.  Because...  No.  Wow.  Because your kids are out there banging. 
[01:34:30]  No.  The eyeliner's on the face.  That's it.  It's over.  Once the eyeliner starts getting in, it means they're hunting.  They're hunting.  They're looking for something.  They're hunting.  Oh!  Oh, no.  And they show up quick.  Oh, God.  Can your daughter hang out?  No.  You've had that?  You can't.  No, I honestly haven't.  Oh, wow.  But I've seen it with the other kids.  Does she wear makeup?  I had a New Year's Eve thing two years ago, 12 years old. 
[01:35:00]  I left the kids alone for like 15 minutes.  People were sucking face.  Oh, man.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Jesus Christ.  I'm not going to call your parents.  Did you call the parents?  Yeah.  Where did you go for 15 minutes?  They were just waiting for you to leave.  They were just waiting for me to turn the corner.  Dry hum and sucking face.  What are you doing?  But that's what we all did at parties.  And that's the thing.  Like, I do remember.  But even then, I was too scared in someone else's house. 
[01:35:30]  I'd rather do it behind a garage or something like that.  Oh, that's funny, dude.  So I called the parents.  I'm like, listen, your 12-year-old's sucking face.  Oh, my God.  She's got his hand.  I just need you to know so you don't think I'm allowing this.  Right.  You want me to pick her up?  No.  Maybe you should talk to her about condoms and getting banged.  I'm just saying.  She's with a 15-year-old boy.  I'm just saying.  That's all you might want to know.  I'm just giving you a heads up.  But they're bummed because they don't want to go get the kid.  And that's it.  They don't care.  They're just like, oh, man. 
[01:36:00]  I got my buzz on.  You really got it.  You really got it.  All right.  I'll see what I can do.  I'll get her porno off her thing again.  I would have known fucking Jim's a cock blocker.  What?  They cut each other?  What do you mean cut?  Girls cut themselves.  Oh, the cutters?  The cutting thing's becoming big, huh?  That wasn't a thing when we were growing up.  Was it a blood bond?  Like that?  No.  They cut themselves for attention.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I never heard of that.  We never had this growing up.  I used to do it. 
[01:36:30]  But we didn't have it growing up.  Seriously?  I was drinking.  Yeah.  I was a teenager.  16, 17.  Are you kidding, Jimbo?  Yeah.  I'm all cut up.  Look at that fucking mess.  You used to cut yourself?  Oh, yeah.  It was a fucking...  Before emo was popular, I was a little attention douche.  Oh, God.  I was a little emo.  Before emo's...  But how did that become popular?  Yeah, like, well, how do you get from...  But, all right, where did you discover that?  You had to see it somewhere.  Where do you go, oh, my God, I'm going to drink.  I'm going to raise it up a level.  I'm just going to cut something.  I'm going to start cutting myself. 
[01:37:00]  I don't remember.  I always carry a box cutter, so I thought it made me...  To protect myself.  Tough guy.  Yeah, I just did it when I was drunk.  I don't remember the first time.  Was it a turn-on in a weird way?  It felt...  Like an adrenaline rush?  Yeah, it felt satisfying.  Somehow satisfying.  Yeah.  Wow!  It made everything okay?  Yeah, it just felt like there was results.  Oh, my God, your age...  I was...  How bad were the cuts?  Tapping pillows.  Someone was pretty bad.  Cut himself.  Yeah.  Wow.  What would you do right after you cut?  I was...  It was such an attention thing.  Oh, yeah.  If I wanted to be dead, I'd be dead.  You used to look at all the blood on you and fuck it. 
[01:37:30]  Sometimes I'd go to sleep like that.  Just wake up with it on me.  All over your sheets and stuff?  Oh, you had on me, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  You had some stuff going on.  Perhaps.  But my point, we're all...  We're all...  Perhaps.  You're just starting to figure that out, Brewer.  But we're all about...  We're all within the same age.  And when we were growing up, there wasn't a lot of that.  But now it seems like it is a thing.  Yeah.  How did it become a thing?  I have no clue.  But it's weird. 
[01:38:00]  It's creepy.  It bleeds into the music, I think.  And once people...  Like, people can now...  Everything is uploadable so people can see it.  Right.  And see the results of it.  Yes.  Back then, you didn't have that.  Right.  So, there's a lot of girls in her school doing this.  Not in her school, but in the area.  In the area.  In the area, it goes on.  More than...  And you just gotta...  Your awareness level is heightened on number four, terrorist alert.  Forget terrorism.  This is terrorism a whole different... 
[01:38:30]  I mean, it's just...  There's so many things going on.  Orange?  Was orange the big one?  Or we went to red?  I think red was red.  Red was red.  Okay.  All right.  Well, I'm in red.  The alert system.  You're in red.  You know, and they're conniving.  You gotta...  You know how I learn with my daughters?  You gotta watch CSI.  I'm not even kidding.  Really?  You know what CSI...  And you know what the best show ever is?  The first 48.  Oh, yeah.  I love that one.  I love that one.  When they interrogate people...  Yep.  You're picking up some pointers.  Here's what they'll do.  Yes.  Here's what they'll do. 
[01:39:00]  They're always very vague.  So, the big thing with teenagers and pre-teens are, can you drop us off at the movie?  Oh, you know, most parents go, oh, okay, I'll drop you off at the movie.  What you don't know is, they've already texted, twittered, a whole gang load.  And the story is, we all meet in the theater, we'll even pay for the ticket, then the minute  they leave, we ditch the place, and we got an hour and a half, or two hours, like the 
[01:39:30]  fire movie's phenomenal.  It's like two hours, 40 minutes.  That's like...  Oh, crazy.  That's a pre-teen, uh, freaking...  The fire movie.  Oh, my God.  It's like, oh, my God, two hours, 40 minutes, we can, we can suck face, we can go, we got  a dumpster, we can try a crank, we can tear this up, and we'll be fine by the time dummies  come back.  And then they push it out, like, there's a pizza place next door, so they buy another  hour. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, God.  Do you hang out in the parking lot?  Have you done it?  No, but it doesn't even get that far, because it goes like this, it goes, uh, this is, I  go, uh, and I, usually on the road, is when she first started, my wife would like, um, you  gotta talk to your daughter, she wants to go to the movie, and she always wants to see  a rated R movie.  Um, so we go, and she calls me up, and she's, yeah, Dad, can I go to a movie?  What movie do you want to see?  No, I want to see, you know, whatever, uh, Tit and Boobie movie. 
[01:40:30]  No.  Okay, what if we see this movie?  So I already know, the con job, uh, yeah.  Of course, pay for that movie and go into the other one, if they even go to the theater.  Right, right, right, all right, so, okay, so this is the game we're going to play.  But we did all that!  I know!  That's what makes it weird, I think, in my head.  And that's why it's even funnier, because I know it, and at the same time, so I go, uh,  all right.  So that was one circumstance, and it was no, just no.  I'd rather go in the theater, in our theater, go watch a movie in there.  So, now, the next time. 
[01:41:00]  Dad, can we all, me, me and my friend are going to see a movie.  Okay, who, who's your friend?  Oh, it's my friend Lisa.  Okay, now, I know from the past, Lisa definitely hangs out with boys.  Um, are there boys involved?  Silence.  Um, maybe.  Ah.  No!  That is yes.  The minute they hesitate, it's a media no.  Yeah.  If they don't know the time of the movie, it's already no, because they know everything. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  They plan days and weeks.  Okay, the movie's at 540.  There's a movie at 610.  If we show up at 5...  They would know all this, yeah.  Right!  So, there's always, like, who's, you gotta probe, who's going to the movie?  Uh, a couple friends.  What are the friends' names?  And then I go right to the mothers.  I need, I need phone numbers of the kids.  You go, what?  Why do you need phone numbers?  Wow.  And then I go, let me talk to your friend. 
[01:42:00]  And Lisa gives me the phone.  Lisa, let me talk to your mother.  I'll call my mother.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Ah, yeah.  Give me the phone number.  I call the mother.  And we'll do, so yeah, I'm a pain in the balls.  Good for you, man.  That's a lot of work.  That's a lot of work.  That's a lot of work.  That's a lot of work.  A lot of parents don't want to go through all that.  Well, you get, if...  I think you should, but I'm just saying.  When you're 17, 18, knock stuff out.  You're 14!  When did she start becoming, uh, just, uh, what am I trying to say?  Where she's just...  Social and boys? 
[01:42:30]  No, just in her own world.  When the family didn't matter as much, and you don't matter as much, and it's all about...  Uh, probably...  When did you lose them, I guess?  Um...  12, 13?  I mean, but then I...  Her, probably around 12.  So, I literally just had to talk with her, like, I have to put her in volunteer work.  Right.  I have to put her in something where she has an awareness of what others go through.  And then I...  Because, and then it's partially my fault.  Well, I mean, we live in, you know, suburbia, upper middle class, like, waiting on line 
[01:43:00]  at Disney, there'd be none of that.  If we can afford first class, we shall be on it.  And so there's...  Right, right, yeah.  There's no sitting in the economy for the Brewers?  Are you kidding me?  So she's got no clue.  Right.  So, uh, you know, she'll be like, why does this one have a small house?  Uh, sorry, hon, no.  We...  This one has a normal house.  Right.  We have, uh...  So, I can give you some examples. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, I'll give you...  I'll give you a...  You want to sit down?  You better sit down.  I'll give you an example.  Brewer never sits down.  No.  He sits down.  I'll give you...  Is it 820 ready?  Yeah.  You killed it.  Oh, no.  You killed it for us.  Darn it.  We got all this stuff to talk about.  Well, yeah, but I gotta...  I have this whole ridiculous...  Oh, wait, you're not here for the duration today?  No.  Oh, man.  I'm here to, like...  Boo.  850, 855.  I have this whole ridiculous...  Jimmy's done this.  I'm sure you...  Once...  We even have done that.  You know when you sit and you gotta do, like, 40 radio stations? 
[01:44:00]  One after another.  Satellite shit.  I got that today and tomorrow.  A media tour.  Wait, what are you promoting?  We don't even know yet.  A song.  A song.  Oh, my God, Jim.  You sent me that and I forgot.  Oh, my God.  I'm an asshole.  It's so good.  No, it's not.  It's terrible.  I swear, we don't even know.  It's called Santa Ain't Coming to Town.  It's...  Okay.  It's called Santa Ain't Coming to Town.  And it's pretty much reprimanding your kids.  How about...  And if you don't...  If you don't shape up, guess what? 
[01:44:30]  He's not coming.  So how...  It's very...  It's got, like, a hard rock metal edge, but it's like...  You know...  Why don't we play the song now?  We'll take a break, and then we can get into the second half of this.  I apologize to Jim.  You sent me this and texted me, and I'm fucking sorry, dude.  Just don't worry about it.  Nah, that's shitty.  You're my friend.  I should open it.  And you didn't send it to me at all.  You son of a bitch.  Oh, man.  It was for the Boneyard.  He sent it to me.  Oh.  It was for the Boneyard.  So how did they get this?  iTunes and all that?  iTunes and all that.  And listen, my wife's redoing a lot of things, so I think an iTunes would be great. 
[01:45:00]  I had it free in my sight for, like, three days, and now it's like on iTunes.  Like, fuck that.  Yeah, now it's on iTunes.  So even if you don't like the song, but you love Brewer, just fucking download Hell,  help Brewer.  Help Brewer out.  I'm redoing Freak...  All right, we're going to get into it.  Let's play the song.  We're going to take a break, then we're going to continue with Jim Brewer.  Do you have it?  Iraq said we do.  I hope so.  I had no idea about it until today.  It's very rock, very...  Whatever.  If you like it, you like it, but it's...  Exactly.  Well, Merry Christmas, boys and girls. 
[01:45:30]  Now, listen, I know we're excited because Santa's coming, but we're going to have to  go over our little list first and make sure that everyone's been a good boy and girl.  Okay?  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,  Merry Christmas.  Yeah, well, I'm checking out all the kiddies' Christmas list.  And you know what?  I have some issues. 
[01:46:00]  Let's review.  Listen up.  Hey, little guy.  How many times has mom asked you, not once, not twice, but over and over again,  clean up all your toys.  But you never do, do you?  No.  You leave them all over the place.  They're in the kitchen.  They're in the bed.  They're in the outside.  They're inside.  They're in my bed. 
[01:46:30]  Please do as you're told.  Otherwise, Santa Claus just might not make it this year.  So when you're doing a favor, start cleaning up all your toys and all your clothes while you're  at it.  Please.  Santa Claus ain't coming to town.  Santa Claus ain't coming to town. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, my sweet little girl.  Pay attention.  Unfold your arms and look at me when I'm talking to you.  We discussed no social media, which means no iPod, no iPad, no computers, or Facebook, 
[01:47:30]  or Snapchat, or Instagram, none of it do you understand, until all your schoolwork and all  your chores are all done.  Otherwise, Santa is going to skip right by the house.  I'm not fooling you, young lady, and neither is Santa.  Okay?  Santa Claus ain't coming to town.  Santa Claus ain't coming to town. 
[01:48:00]  Okay, let's tighten up as a family, okay?  This Christmas, we're going to get back to the true meaning, which means spreading joy and  using manners, which means please and thank you, and doing things that we're asked to  do, and not repeating ourselves over and over to the point where Mom and I have both had  it.  Okay? 
[01:48:30]  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Santa Claus ain't coming to town.  Stand to close 
[01:49:00]  He ain't coming  He ain't coming  Stand to close  He ain't coming  He ain't coming no more  He ain't coming no more  He ain't coming no more  Listen or he ain't coming  Deal with it  Punks, Merry Christmas. 
[01:49:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Bravo, Jim.  That's great.  Brewer's new Christmas song over there.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Got you, Brewer, in studio. 
[01:50:00]  Make sure you go to iTunes and get that Christmas song, please.  Brewer says he needs the money.  And if you missed it, I'll be playing it on my Boneyard show tonight.  It was really good, man.  I'm not being polite either.  It was actually really good.  No, I'm very nervous.  Why?  Why are you nervous?  Because it's just out of my butt. 
[01:50:30]  Out of your comfort zone?  I'm a little cocky.  I like this song.  But when I have peers like Jimmy, literally when I hit send, it's like, go.  It's out of my hands now.  It's done.  He's either going to go, fucking Brewer, in a stupid little fucking retarded little faggy song.  And then I didn't hear from him.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  I feel so horrible.  We were texting, and the problem was, I haven't been on the...  I pre-taped some Boneyards, because I was away.  I was in L.A. last week.  Right. 
[01:51:00]  And so I wasn't on the air that much.  And then even seeing you this morning, I didn't remember until you mentioned it.  I'm like, oh my God, what a dog shit friend I am.  Yeah, but I'm the same way.  Yeah.  I'm the same way people send me stuff.  Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you get 40 emails a day and texts, and you're diverted 24-7, and then you go home.  I think the song's going to do well.  Our audience should go to iTunes and get it for Jim Brewer, please, because his wife's  remodeling.  Also, really fast, jimbrewer.com, because I see you're all over the fucking place this  week.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, this week, yeah.  You're everywhere.  A bunch of different cities.  North Carolina, Atlanta, and a bunch of places in Tennessee. 
[01:51:30]  So if you're in any of those areas, go to jimbrewer.com to see where he's going to be,  okay?  How are the one-off and comedy club nights, Jim, that you're doing?  The best.  That's good, right?  They're always sold out.  Really?  They're phenomenal.  I may even, I may next year tour just during the week.  I love being home on the weekends.  So to do a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and come home like Friday, or a Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday, and like two shows on a Friday and come home is phenomenal. 
[01:52:00]  And I like going from one city to the next city to the next city to the next city.  Keeps it fresh, right?  Yeah, and you don't get bored.  And since staying in a hotel for three days.  Not only that, I hate two shows.  I'm done with it.  I'm too old.  I just don't have the energy.  I'm done with it.  I don't like doing, you know, even same premises.  It drives me bonkers.  And I'm tightening up an hour right now.  So it's, you know, I'm done.  I'm ready to go. 
[01:52:30]  So just before break, you were sitting down.  What were we going to discuss?  Uh, we were talking about just the added, I think we were going into Africa.  Oh, all right.  You were going with the daughter?  Is that where we were going?  Well, it's part of the daughter thing.  Oh, okay, okay.  It's part of the daughter thing.  Yeah, you went, you went to Africa with, uh, can I, well, James Hetfield.  I mean, it's out there.  We were on Instagram and all that.  Oh, great.  That's pretty cool.  And that's when I knew I was safe.  Because I was very nervous about going into a safari.  Because we're staying in tents. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, man.  We're staying literally in tents.  Yeah.  In the middle of nowhere.  And, um...  Wow, that's cool.  It was cool.  Were you scared?  I was real scared.  Yeah.  Because you...  And you had your whole family?  Yeah.  That's why...  Oh, man.  I would Google every night, you know, people mauled by lions.  Yeah, you're just prey at that point.  Who's been mauled by safaris?  Is there revolutions?  There's more food out there.  Right.  Is there a lot of people getting mauled?  I didn't find any.  So, my first question, you're in tents in the bush, basically. 
[01:53:30]  Yes.  So, how do they protect you?  Well, this is what they say.  They...  They say, um...  They say, listen, you have guns?  Yeah.  But we're going to sleep way over there.  You're not going to have a problem.  You're going to hear lion.  You're going to hear hyena.  You hear shit.  Oh, yeah.  This is what you hear.  Vroom.  Vroom.  Vroom.  And you're...  And you're in your tent.  Your eyes are bulged like a cartoon. 
[01:54:00]  And you don't want to move or make a sound.  And the sweat, I literally could slide off my bed because I was sweating so bad.  Now, what I was really petrified about was, in the tent next to us was my eight-year-old  daughter.  And she's staying with three other kids.  And they tell you, like, listen, don't turn on lights.  And don't make a noise in the night.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Because the animals just think it's a big tent.  And then, you know, if you start going, oh, I'm in here. 
[01:54:30]  And the curiosity...  Now it's a TV dinner, right?  Where's your bathroom, by the way?  Is there a bathroom in the tent?  There is a bathroom in the tent.  However, you have to unzip the back of your tent.  And then you're kind of in another section of the tent.  And then you've got to unzip that.  And literally, you're sitting on grass.  And there is a little bit...  I mean, it's not like staked down.  You know, a snake.  Anything could be...  So I was doing a lot of hovering.  You see ants and big bugs and beetles while you're...  And all lights are off. 
[01:55:00]  So you've got to kind of bring a flashlight.  All the generators, everything's off at night.  And the first night, he's like, listen, you know, you're going to hear lion and hyena.  Just stay in the tent.  And you're fine.  I promise you, you're fine.  But you hear, hyenas are eerie.  You hear like...  What is that?  And then you...  And it's all around you.  And you...  Oh, my God.  And you freaked out.  And then the second night, a freaking hyena went against our tent. 
[01:55:30]  You can hear him walking on the mat.  And then he scraped against it.  And then sat in front of him for a second.  It was just complete sight.  He got up, walked away.  And then I remember Dee going, did you hear that?  And I went, yeah, look at her.  Just be quiet.  Just be quiet.  And we got out.  And there's, you know, there's this footprint in the morning right there.  Holy shit.  And then you ask the guys.  And they're like, oh, yeah.  He was, you know, they smell the food. 
[01:56:00]  And they're like coming for the scraps.  Like food.  I mean, to them, it's normal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the stupid lights come around.  They went to freaking shaking lights.  Yeah, but can't you get a guy to stand in front of your tent with a gun?  Give him some extra?  You probably could.  But at the end of the day, they don't really bother you.  Do they stay up?  They don't stay up at night?  No, they go to sleep.  I would assume they would stay up at night and let you guys sleep.  No.  You've got a brand new crew in the morning.  They stay up a little bit.  But no, they're up all night.  Now, the second is the first drive drive we go on. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  But I'll post this.  I'll try to post this online.  We're videotaping.  And there's three cars.  And the back car is them.  Just the adults.  Me and my wife, James, his wife.  The middle car is the teenagers, preteens.  The first car is my eight-year-old and one of his sons.  His one son.  And we come across these elephants.  And elephants are kind of close. 
[01:57:00]  A little baby elephant.  And you're like, oh, my God.  And then they freaking charge.  And I'm videotaping.  You just see the camera go kaboom.  Straight down.  And the thing charges my daughter's car.  The eight-year-old.  While she's sticking out of the top.  Hits it.  It's like Jurassic Park.  And drags it.  Holy shit.  About ten feet.  And the whole time I'm just visualizing getting tossed.  Crushed to death.  They jump out of the car. 
[01:57:30]  No guns.  The guy's clapping.  And you hear him going.  Come on.  I swear my life.  I'll send you the video.  Oh, I believe it.  And so the thing.  Then I pick up the camera.  Once he starts running away.  And I pick him up.  And he shakes his ears.  And he kind of gives us like a little F you in his trunk.  And then takes off.  And everyone then turns to me.  Did you get that video?  No, I didn't get a video.  I panicked. 
[01:58:00]  And I wanted to see what was going to happen to Dean.  And my daughter's like, oh, I got it.  I got it all.  And she did.  It kind of me.  I was kind of excited.  Oh, wow.  She's got the snapshot of the elephant pushing the car.  Holy shit.  And you see my daughter like looking on like, oh, my God.  It's freaking elephant.  It was a baby elephant that pushed the car?  No.  It was a full grown.  It was one of the teenagers.  So how did the guy fucking clap his hands and make the elephant go away?  He says they think it's a gun.  And now they claim never, ever do elephants actually make contact. 
[01:58:30]  Most of the time, they charge.  And they'll get all the way up to the.  And they do that slide stuff.  And then they do slide stuff.  Right.  Their ears go out fucking real wide.  Right.  And it works.  Yeah.  And but he goes, this was very unusual that he actually made contact.  Yeah, of course.  Why wouldn't it be unusual?  Why wouldn't it be unusual when I'm here?  Of course.  Of course it's unusual.  Why didn't the car drive when the elephant was charging it? 
[01:59:00]  Our cars were off because when we first got there, it spooked them.  So we turned the engines off.  So you're sitting there and you're taking in the ambiance and the elephant.  Did you complain to the manager?  I want to complain.  The manager.  I'd like to see the supervisor, please.  The supervisor, please.  I'll tell you.  That's why I love that fucking Disney Jungle Cruise.  Nothing fucking, nothing unexpected.  God, you just assume they have it all figured out.  Like you're in tents and they're staying up all night for you.  No, in fact, one night, one of the last nights, it was the greatest thing in the world. 
[01:59:30]  How long, by the way, was your trip?  Twelve nights.  Wow.  Okay.  So in one of the last nights, and you're in a different park every other night.  One of the last nights, we're all sitting around a fire.  And it's before dinner.  Before dinner, one of the Zulu guys come to your tent.  You get a flash of light.  He comes, picks you up with a spear.  Oh, shit.  And he walks you to the fire, which is next to the dinner tent.  So you go there, and all of a sudden, we hear like, and he gets a flashlight, and about 
[02:00:00]  30 yards away, he's a freaking hippo.  Oh, shit.  And that's the first time I saw, that's the first time I saw that.  Don't look to your right, Jim.  Oh, you're right.  Sorry.  That's the first time I saw a safari guy panic a little.  He went, okay, everybody stay behind the fire and start slowly backing up and head towards  the tent.  Please go in the tent.  And out of all the animals in all of Africa, hippos are the most dangerous. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, they kill more people over there than any other animal.  I didn't know they attack on land.  I always thought like, oh, wait, people retarded?  You don't know in the water?  No.  They come up on land to graze like an elephant.  And if they see you, they're heading for you, and they snap you right in half of their  jaw.  Jesus Christ.  So wait, did the hippo see you guys?  Of course he did, right?  He did.  And at one point, yeah, he was sideways.  And when we flashed a light, he faced us.  Oh, man.  And that's when, and then the other guy picked up and he stuck the lights in his eyes and 
[02:01:00]  we all went behind the fire because the fire is freaking them out.  How primal is that?  Hey, we got to protect ourselves with fire.  Yeah, do you ever think you'd be hiding behind a fire from a fucking hippo?  Yeah, in 2013.  You'd be on television.  Yeah.  Right.  I was in the real Survivor.  That was the real Survivor.  Jeez, no shit.  Do they have guns, the guys?  They got to have a gun.  They do have guns.  Okay, so.  Because we would go on, guys, and they would definitely have guns.  I'm sure it's the ultimate last resort to shoot one of them. 
[02:01:30]  We just, we didn't even know.  We just, we went to the dinner tent.  And once you're in the tent, he's not going to, he's not going to bother you.  And it's just too noisy.  There's too many people.  It's fire.  They don't want to mess with it.  Yeah.  But it was, it was sick.  Yeah, no kidding.  How big was the hippo?  It was awesome.  How big was the hippo?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It was probably about, probably a good eight, nine, probably like eight feet long.  He was a, he was a big hippo.  Do they not like being petted?  That's amazing.  I tried my damnedest, but no, he wouldn't. 
[02:02:00]  If I had pictures, I'd, I'd, I gotta tell you, you know, everybody thinks that when cavemen  finally discovered fire, how to make fire, you always think of the cooking aspect first.  It's like, oh, and, and heat and stuff like that.  How fucking great must it have been to go like, wait a minute, everything that tries  to eat me is afraid of this shit?  That's right.  It's like, gotta be the greatest fucking thing they ever came up on.  Like, we'll just put this shit out by, in front of the cave.  And now no fucking things are gonna just sneak in and eat our babies, uh, tonight. 
[02:02:30]  You're right.  You're right.  This had to be the most amazing thing.  It really was.  And, and, and, and, and that's the first time that thought process even went, because  the first thing he said was, get beyond the fire.  Fire.  Oh, yeah.  The animals are fire.  I hate this shit.  This is great.  This is great.  Hey, this is great.  Get to fire!  You know what I would have torched on, man?  There's not an animal on the face of the earth that has figured out, except for man,  how to put that shit out.  You know, like, there's not one other fucking animal that can put that fucking shit out. 
[02:03:00]  And even we have trouble.  But at least, you know.  You would have, um.  Oh, that's fucked up, dude.  There was, uh, um, there was another, we, we went to this, this tribe in the middle of  the bush, middle of nowhere.  And it was one night we slept in these tents that weren't even canvas.  They were see-through.  Oh, God.  Mesh tents.  So we're sitting there, and there's no big animals, but there's, there's, there's no  predators, so they say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the mission was to find these guys called the Hazda tribe.  They, they think that maybe they're the original man, I don't know. 
[02:03:30]  They're like our Indians.  They're nomads.  And we find them, and they take us hunting and show us how to make fire and all this  stuff.  And, you know, you give them salt, and they're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Meanwhile, they're just African actors.  They're just, that's like our Disney, Nick.  Right?  Oh, you just happened to find them.  And that's all I could keep thinking.  I'm like, no, you know, the safari guide was like, listen, I got these guys coming, the  guys in Metallica, and the other guys in the video, I can really use your help here.  Yeah, when they all, when they all, when they all get together, they sound like every cast 
[02:04:00]  member from The Wire in real life.  They're just like, oh, yes, well, we were out there in the bush.  That one guy looked like he was high all the time.  I see his kids look just as big as him.  It was crazy.  So they took you hunting, though.  Dude.  That's pretty fucked up.  The best, but they, they separate you.  So you're only allowed to, a court warrior.  So me and my eight-year-old are following this guy through the freaking middle of nowhere. 
[02:04:30]  And I started panicking, because you really don't see anyone else, and you're in high grass,  and you're going around, and you're going around, and he eventually, he kept going around  these rocks, and he'd shoot now, and then he finally came out with a spear through like  a, one of those prairie looking, he looked like a prairie dog.  Yeah.  And the thing's still alive, and my daughter's traumatized, like, oh, my God.  And I'm going, oh, it's great.  And he took his head and smashed it on a rock, and he smashed the thing, and he tied it up  to his waist.  Like, that's his lunch later. 
[02:05:00]  It was pretty fucked.  When I, when I put the whole thing together, I'll bring, I'll show you, like, little highlights  of that.  It's freaking, that was one of the best, when you see him just holding this thing up with  an arrow through it, and he smashes it, and ties it up to his waist.  Like, it's no big deal.  All right, let's keep continuing our, our journey.  Were there any hotels at all, like, when you first got there, or was it right to the bush?  We, when we landed, our safari guy picked us up, and the first thing I saw was in the  middle of the night, we were just on Dirt Road. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, man.  We were in Tanzania, and you just see people wandering, like, the street, there's no, like,  no shoes.  Where are they going?  That's, I'm like, where are they, some people walk, there was a fish market we went to one  day in the middle of the desert.  We had to drive, like, five hours in a desert to get from one destination to the other, and  people have, like, a donkey in the desert, and they're walking, like, a day and a half,  two days, just to go buy some fish.  And the way they keep the fish fresh is they smoke it, so they smoke it right there, and 
[02:06:00]  just, and they do this once a month, and they stack up on, like, enough fish to get  them by.  And it's Lily living in the middle of nowhere.  What did you eat?  Oh, he ate, like, kings and queens, I'd say.  Did you eat well?  He brought in the good stuff.  Yeah, no.  So, this guy, Lily, would set up dinner like a four-star restaurant every night in a tent.  It was a, and one day, he surprised us.  We were in the middle of the Serengeti, and we wake up one morning, and we didn't have  anything, and then all of a sudden, we just stopped, and they have this full-blown freaking 
[02:06:30]  buffet set up.  So, we sit down, and we're eating.  It's freaking amazing.  And I started backing up, because the picture was amazing.  So, I'm about maybe 50 yards away, and I'm snapping, shining.  I got some on video.  And they're going, hey, hey, hey, hey!  No, no, no, no, come back.  Come back.  So, what is it?  You can't wander off.  You got to stay in the group.  Oh, shit.  And then, we finished breakfast, got in the car, and I don't think we drove 60 yards,  and it was a whole pride alliance, just hanging out. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, fuck.  Underneath the tree with babies and everything.  They were probably just watching us, like, is this dope?  It goes back any further.  It lingers any longer.  It's like anybody else watching an ice cream cake back up towards them.  Yeah, it was.  Wow.  It was freaking awesome.  That's awesome.  You weren't worried about, like, the food or water.  You're getting sick.  I was, but they supplied nothing but bottled water, and the food was unbelievable. 
[02:07:30]  Really?  What kind of stuff did you eat?  Well, yeah, we had steak.  We had chicken.  It was, like, curry chicken.  But did you eat any of that weird shit?  Hippo or cheetah?  No, no, no, no, no.  And the guy, I mean, the guy's an upsk...  I mean, the safari guy literally flies to the States,  and he goes over everything you want to do and everything you want to eat.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  What kind of wine you want to drink, what kind of alcohol you like.  Damn.  Dude, you would love... 
[02:08:00]  And if you're a hunter?  Yeah, Anthony would love it.  There is one element he might not care for.  You won't even have to deal with that, Ant.  You won't even have to deal with that.  That's hilarious.  Fucking Jimmy.  Totally different.  Totally different.  Oh, I know.  I've heard.  Totally different.  Yeah.  There's no music culture there.  No.  If that's what you're worried about.  Yeah, no, no.  Totally different culture.  What airline did you guys take?  KLM through Amsterdam.  Eight hours Amsterdam, eight hours to Kilimanjaro.  Out of L.A.? 
[02:08:30]  Something like that.  No, no.  Jersey.  It was unreal, man.  It was awesome.  Sounds like a great time.  You would like it.  I probably would.  You would really like it.  Yeah, I probably would.  But if you were to do it, do it through the people we went through.  I mean, it's literally, you don't have to see nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  They personally, they wait for you at the airport.  Get you.  Brings you to his, to his, he brings you to a freaking, his compound overnight.  I, and I mean, now I just watched the freaking movie, what do you call it, with the, Django? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm on the plane, I watch Django, and then I show up at his compound, and you're like,  wow, this reminds me a lot of the movie.  I mean, it's just, like, they're waiting for you.  He's a white guy.  Oh, Jesus.  And they're waiting for you to pick up your, but I'm like, I got my bag, like, no, no,  no, no, no.  Why do I go?  Oh, my God.  Anyway, I'm like, all right, all right, take my bag, you know, and I'm not going to, and  you know, and they, you stay in these amazing places.  It's, uh, it's pretty awesome.  Wow. 
[02:09:30]  It was awesome.  It's really good.  Damn, dude.  It's that time.  I think you gotta go.  That's so fucking cool.  Darn it.  Brew's gotta go.  This sucks.  I love, I love listening to Brew.  There's very few people I've said before that have the gift to be able just to hold everyone's attention  for a while.  Jim is like, Louie's the guy who can do it, and you, I can't think of many, even comedians  that can be as interesting as talking about anything.  What does Louie do?  Is he, is he resting for a while?  What is he doing?  No, he's shooting a show.  He is shooting a show.  God, he's freaking brilliant.  Yeah.  I was just watching one of his stand-up specials, uh, over the weekend. 
[02:10:00]  Let's throw it on.  I had seen it before.  His fucking act actually has re-watchability.  Yes.  It's so odd with comics, like, you know, there's certain comics that you could just watch the whole  thing again, and it's funny still.  Yeah, and that doesn't happen a lot.  It's so weird.  He's made me work real hard.  Yeah.  I'm not even kidding.  Like, he made me go, oh, that's, that's what you gotta do.  Yeah.  You just gotta keep pumping and pumping and pumping.  So, I owe a lot to what he's doing.  All right, Brewers.  Thanks for having me, man.

[02:16:30]  Where I realized  I gotta do  Radio  Very different  Than what I thought  And I've been  Uploading some clips  On my YouTube channel  OP Radio  There's one where  Actually this might even  Be worth playing  He talks about protesters  He had the gays  Protesting his show  Alright  Are you in the videos  At all?  Did they catch you at all?  Yeah  I'm a complete  And utter nobody  Trust me  I was just getting  My radio career going  And I  And Brother Weez  Sort of took me  Under his wing  He was cool to me  You could see me  In the background  Here and there  With a fucking camera  Just taking pictures  And being like 
[02:17:00]  A rah-rah guy  I got like a WCMF  Lobster sweatshirt on  I'm just like  Fucking promoting  The company  And the radio station  You're a Denny  Pretty much  Yeah  A young Denny  So if you  I got more clips  That will be going up  In the coming days  But you'll see me  In the upper left corner  Because I was up  On like a cabinet  Or something  Because the studio  Had like 30 people in it  Anyway  After the show  Local TV  Talked to Sam Kinison  About these  About these protesters  That were at his show  And what he's saying 
[02:17:30]  Is like the same shit  We're dealing with  Today in 2013  I want to see the video  Wow  This is 24 years ago  Fuck  And this is just  The news  Talking to Sam Kinison  One of the videos  Up on my channel  OP Radio  On YouTube  Go there  Okay Sam 
[02:18:00]  You had some protesters  At your show  Last night in Syracuse  And there's a group  Here in Rochester  That's planning  To do the same  Oh they are  Yeah  What's your feeling  I don't know  What they're trying  To accomplish  I don't know  What their message is  I mean I'm not  I'm not on public radio  Or television  Doing my routines  It's a show  That you have to  Come and see  And pay your money to see  I think the constitution  Allows people to be entertained  By what they  Consider entertainment  You know  And that's all I'm doing  I'm a comedian  That's a comedy show  And if I was David Duke  Down in Louisiana  I would understand  This kind of reaction 
[02:18:30]  But basically  I think they're totally  Misinterpreting me  And maybe even using me  To establish a name  For themselves  In the local area  As some kind of  New AIDS awareness group  We're trying to figure out  What the protest is about  I guess they don't agree  With the jokes  But you know  I mean what do you do  If you don't agree  With the jokes  You just don't go to the show  You don't support  The entertainment  You are what you are  Yeah  That's exactly  Unlike any other rock band  Or any other movie  I mean you know  I didn't enjoy  Tort song trilogy  With Harvey Fierstein  And Matthew Bronick  But I didn't hold a sign  I'm going to go  Don't see this 
[02:19:00]  Or you'll know  What Ferris Bueller  Does on his day on  You know  So I mean  Everybody has a right  To their own taste  In entertainment  I don't think these people  Have the right to legislate  What I can do on that stage  I mean I have a  Constitutional right too  And if I don't want to  Understand the gay movement  I don't have to  I can misunderstand it  That's my constitutional right  So they want to protest  All they're going to do  Is make me bigger  And sell out the room for me  Wow  What are you doing here  With Weez  And then it goes on  That's pretty good  Isn't that wild  Yeah  That's exactly  What's going on  I disagree with them though 
[02:19:30]  I think they do have the right  To tell you what's appropriate  So yeah  Well  You think Sam Kinson  If he was alive today  Would be into the gay movement thing  He'd probably  He probably would change  He wouldn't be saying  He wouldn't be thinking  The same way probably  I don't think so either  Because in the last 20 years  A lot of people  Have changed their opinions  Are kind of like  Oh alright  Right  Because the more gays  That have come out  And the more people that  You realize you're working with  You know what I mean  I'm just thinking that  It's really hard to all of a sudden  Right  Hate gays  And uh 
[02:20:00]  I don't think he was hating gays  No I don't mean him  But you know what I'm saying  I'm just saying in general  Yeah  Look at that studio though  That's Jimmy Schubert  With really long hair on the left  Is that Jimmy with the sunglasses?  Yup  Believe it or not  Wow  I mean it's a  1989  Carl LeBeau is in studio  Where's Carl?  With the black hat  Alan Stevens  Very good  And then uh  This guy on the right  Is Marty something  Do you know a comic named Marty from  Marty?  No  He hung with Sam  So I don't know  If he was just a friend  Or if he also was a stand up  With the hat  Is this Mitchell Walters 
[02:20:30]  With the hat or no?  Uh  Mitchell  I'm only guessing  With the ponytail  Was it Marty or  Maybe it was Mitchell  Mitchell Walters  It looks like Mitchell Walters  I can't see his face  I'm only seeing him  Because he has glasses  And a ponytail  Right  And Mitchell  Was he a funny guy?  Yeah  He uh  Yes I just would love to see his face  I wouldn't have recognized Schubert though  Right  So I'm just getting into the video  It's like an hour and ten minutes  I'm just throwing  I'm editing the shit out of it  Because there's a lot of down time  Music playing and shit like that  But uh  Wow  What a cool vibe  It's literally  The day that changed my life 
[02:21:00]  When I watched Sam Kinison work  I'm like holy fuck  You could do a lot  On a live mic  At a radio station  I pop in every once in a while  I want to see you in the background  I don't even know if I'm in this clip  But there's other clips I am  You'll see my stupid little fucking  Opster head pop in  To take a picture of Sam Kinison  And then um  Can you go to another video?  I find it hilarious  I don't even know  Fuck  But as I'm going through this tape  There were two guys in another studio 
[02:21:30]  They were filming through the glass  And there were girls in the studio  And they were all horned up  And creeping on these girls  But they sounded so fucking pathetic  What do you mean?  Can you play part of that?  Did they sound uh  And I just cut this up  And put it up there  It has nothing to do with Kinison  Oh thank you  That's the girl  She faxed it in  It's got her tattoo  Oh she's a pig  Get her out of there  Get her out of there  I like that blonde right there  She looks fucking  She looks like a fucking gobble queen 
[02:22:00]  Oh  Unbelievable  Her up the ass  My boss is sitting there going  Oh show us your tip  Oh man  She's going to talk about  I think the blonde is going to do it  No  You think so?  Yeah we should  And she just watched her  Oh there's Wheeze  Okay  Sam's giving her the pressure  I'll pause  Yeah  Pause right there  That's my midriff  Above Wheeze's head  In the white sweatshirt  Right there  That's me  Oh okay  So I was in there  That day  But I think this video is hilarious 
[02:22:30]  Because these guys just start  Completely losing their minds  Gobble queen  I know  They were fucking  They thought they were being cool  By saying that  Play a little more of it  Looking at all the 80's attire  They're laughing at us  There's 30 guys in the studio  They're laughing it up  Show us your tip  Show us your tip  There she's going to  You can tell  That shirt  That shirt's got  That shirt's got  Fucking titties  It's a tuxedo shirt

[02:50:30]  You don't think they're cool  No they're a bunch of nerds  It got me away from editing  The cool shit of the video  Which is Sam Kinison  I'm like fuck Sam Kinison  These guys are a treat  That shit is gold  I love it  They're a treat  And they were just like  Spicing their dialogue  With curses  To try to make it seem  More edgy  Just to each other  Right  Fucking  Yeah  Those fucking tits  Yeah  Well one was the older guy  I bet his co-worker  Was like a younger guy  A newer guy  And he's trying to sound like  The old fucking cool radio guy  Look at me  He's not wrong 
[02:51:00]  I don't will that shirt off  He was a sales guy  That was there for most of my time  There  And then the other guy  In the room  Cause it's  I'm starting to remember all this now  Was a younger sales guy  Yeah  Not by age  But by experience  Yeah  More than anything  He's trying to make the cool guy  How long do you think  That people would last at the station  Before they realized  He was a dingus  I swear  I remember him  As being like  Alright  That guy could not have been alright  Then there's another  Video I'll put up  Where now the camera's in studio 
[02:51:30]  And you'll be able to see those guys  Oh nice  So now they'll be the famous guys  Right  But that'll be later today  I got a lot of editing to do  See like  This was a guy  Who would  Every time somebody new came in  Right  He would try to impress them  Because his coolness  Yeah  Would only last like a month  You didn't think he was cool huh  No fucking way  You think he knew what to do with a girl  No  With big pooders  Hey dude  Some chicks are gonna come in the studio  Why don't you come with me  In the back room here  Let me show you how it's done  Let me show you  Right  Yeah  Look at that chick  Fuck 
[02:52:00]  All these guys think I'm a nerd  He'd probably refer to a girl's tits  As puppies to her  Oh yeah  So these puppies are nice  Yeah nice puppies you got there  Oh thanks  The girl's like  Shut up  I just want a prize  I just want to win a prize  Hey well quiet down a little  I think I hear your puppies barking at me  Ah yeah  She'll just give me the tickets to the show  I gotta fucking entertain this shithead  Say I'll twat with a bad mustache  I'm not gonna fuck you okay  There was another girl that came in  And um 
[02:52:30]  She showed  She flashed whatever  Damn  And they gave her a pair of tickets  And they thought that was the funniest thing ever  What  A pair for a pair  A pair for a pair  They made that joke  Yeah  They would die  They thought it was hilarious  But no one was making that joke  They just said here's a pair of tickets  That they lost their minds  A pair  Wow  Hey that pair got her a pair  Write that down for weeks  Get it in the joke  Yeah that's a good one right there  A pair for a pair  Then the contest got sad  When they only had one ticket to give away  Well we have the one single 
[02:53:00]  Oh god  Sit alone  That's great  He's like a low rent porn star extra  Snacklefish  Yeah  Snacklefish on Twitter  Looks like we just got tickets to the beaver show  What's a beaver show?  A beaver show  Yeah  What's that?  Nice beaver  He sounds like Jim Florentine  If he had zero confidence  Or humor 
[02:53:30]  Yeah  Right  Yeah  I mean Florentine's hilarious  Open the shirt opening  Yeah I'm dying to see that  I want to see the shirt opening thing  Like Florentine would go up to her face  Hey come on honey  Show your fucking tits already  This guy  Is behind bulletproof glass  Yeah  Being a fucking ladies man  It's just other dudes  Yeah  Just praying that the young guy  Wouldn't pick up on the fact  That he's a nerd alert  A douche  Yeah  A dingus  Yeah  Yeah  Anyway 
[02:54:00]  So  Spent my weekend looking at that video  It was pretty cool to see  Holy fuck  Sam Kinison in his prime  Oh school  1989  He was gone a mere three years later  92 I believe  Yeah  That is fucked up  There was really no outlet for a video like that  You'd shoot a bunch of video  And unless you popped it in your dumb VCR at home  And showed people  Traded their game  No one saw it  But why couldn't we  Like a local access show or something  No one did that  Where were the visionaries 
[02:54:30]  I know it was tougher with the technology  But there were outlets on TV and stuff  But it was a big deal to show people though  Yeah  Like those tapes made the rounds though man  Like fucking faces of death and all those  Right  They did make the rounds  Some people  It just took longer  And your copy would be horrendous  Yeah  Because it was like a hundred generations or whatever  Twitter was hand to hand  YouTube was hand to hand  But I mean it was getting around  But it was very odd  Like just things like that though  That you would just record  You'd record a fucking family vacation  Or a birthday party 
[02:55:00]  Or all that shit just sat there  Yeah  No one watched it  But like you're taping your vacation  Some whacked out thing happens  Somebody does something ridiculous  Falls on his head  Yeah  Now that would be a massive viral video on YouTube  Right  And back then  Then you didn't even know what to do  You would show your friends and your family  That was about it  Yeah  The only visionaries were the ones  That were going around  Trying to buy people's weird clips  And then putting out those compilation VHSs  Or the Jess tapes  Or the TV shows  Or the America's Funniest Videos 
[02:55:30]  Right  America's Funniest Videos  Buzzy's good friend had a guy  And I've showed you some of the tapes over the years  Oh man  He was a collector  Oh right  Yeah  Yeah  You know back then  All the news footage  All the news footage  Even though they knew they couldn't show  Like the  I saw one  It was a motorcycle accident  Where the guy was  Absolutely fucking headless  There was a head on the side of the road  And they did the story  On the horrific motorcycle accident  But they filmed all that shit  For their own shit 
[02:56:00]  They knew there was no way  It was going to make TV  Right  But then they would put it on a tape  And trade with other news stations  From around the country  And they were all in on it man  And this one guy we knew  Buzzy's friend mostly  He had a whole basement  Filled with shit  I wonder if that guy ever did anything  With that stuff  Made a YouTube channel or something  There's got to be a bunch of useless video  Out there from people's  Just mundane lives  A lot of birthday parties and things  Right  But it's cool now  Because some of this stuff 
[02:56:30]  Is like 30 years old  Well yeah  So you can put it  Now you can put it  People are putting it up  On their Facebook  That's what I mean  A quick video of them  When they were 10 or 8  Or whatever the fuck  The weird videos that you put up  Like Christmas  That's like throw away video  But you put it up now  And it's like  It's not throw away anymore  It's film  Wow  It's actual 8mm film  Yeah  We got a little bit  A little bit for everybody  A little bit  Did we do everything for today?  A little tit  Pretty much  The only thing for me is 
[02:57:00]  I like to have the bigger ones  Yeah  Yeah  That's what I like  Good looking girl  She's good looking  I like that  Yeah  Fuck  Fuck yeah  Oh no  What is that?  Oh my god  It's Chip Baca  What?  Chip Baca  Yeah maybe  The Wookiee  Yeah  The Millennium Falcon  What they call it  The Millennium Eagle  Where did you 
[02:57:30]  Create Chip Baca  Just hours alone in my house  Doing that over and over again  Television show  Or a joke to write  Or something  No  Just alone  Hours you did that?  Dude  Hours  I walked around  Just being Chip Baca  All day in my fucking house  Chip Baca  To yourself  Yeah  Han Solo  How come he doesn't have friends  Or something  What the fuck  Fucking Yoda 
[02:58:00]  Fucking Greenwood  Or something  Whatever  That's horrible  Jedi  I don't really like Chip Baca  No I don't either  Who shot first?  Oh right  And or Greedo  Yeah  What's that?  Who shot first?  That's a  Yeah  Greedo  How come he doesn't be happy  With what he's got?  Chip Baca 
[02:58:30]  Is going to be a sensation  No he's not  You don't think so?  No  I thought of it  Because I was talking to someone  About the Star Wars  Fucking Christmas special  And I watched a little bit of it  Yeah  God  Isn't that so utterly bad?  The fact that that got made  Is just atrocious  How anybody shot that  And thought it was good  Yeah  Wow  Maud  Well it was starving for  Starry for  You know  Anything Star Wars related  Oh god 
[02:59:00]  It was terrible  So that's probably  Went into it  Mala and Lumpy  And Itchy  The names  Oh they were terrible  And then Jefferson Starship  Or something  I didn't watch the whole thing  Was there  And then  They were all talking  They were a big get back then  So bad  See but this is now in line  This was really hard to find  For a really long time  Yes  The Star Wars Holiday Show  1978 on YouTube  That one has no audio  You gotta get one with audio Sam  That one's got no audio  Oh there it is  No  The audio was taken off  Yeah they took it off  Why? 
[02:59:30]  Because it was a copier of violation  So you have to find little clips  Find the one with the Spanish subtitles  I was watching that one  Wait but they allow the video to stay up there  But not the audio?  I don't know  Yeah  Oh  Lumpy  The announcer  With special guest stars  Beatrice Arthur  Beatrice  Oh is this embarrassing  God is this fucking horrid  Diane Carroll  Oh  You think this is good?  This is embarrassing  Jefferson Starship 
[03:00:00]  Jefferson Starship  You know her Starship  Right  That's cool  Harvey Corman  Who thought this up?  Awful  Animated Star Wars story  On the Star Wars Holiday Special  Oh so awful  Wow  Life day  They had to get back for a life day  Right  Oh this is so bad  You know like when they zoom in on the Wookiee's house  On the cartoon Wookiee house  And for ten minutes there's no dialogue  Yes they're just making noises  They show Itchy and Mala and Lumpy playing in the house 
[03:00:30]  Nice music  It's like a regular house  Except there  The rainbow  Shit sticking to their fur  Connection  Shit sticking to their fur  The kids coming down with a fake plane  This is it  Them just  Making these noises  Star Wars is like a massive movie  And on a big movie set and everything  This is not a shitty TV studio  This is all about marketing though  That's why I hate George Lucas  It's just to sell stuff  What are they saying? 
[03:01:00]  Chip Baca  He's going  Look at this plane  How come it's not called a symbol  And the old guy's going  Get away from me Chip Baca  Go in your room or something  I gotta lay down with Lamar  This is ridiculous  They just make noises  There's no subtitles  There's no anything  No  No little cute like Pekingese looking things 
[03:01:30]  More dog shit fucking products  This is terrible  You don't like that?  It was one of the worst things I think I've ever seen  Yeah  Oh look at this  She's got the apron on the mother  Why is she wearing an apron?  She's a cunt  It's like fur  There's hair all over everything  She cooks a pie  There's just hair in it  It's terrible  A hair pie is not bad  A hair pie  Hey show your hair pie  Come on honey  Nice  Hair pie 
[03:02:00]  I'll take a slice of hair pie from her  And another helping for dessert  Hey  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah  Oh shut up Lumpy  Oh god  I know  Lumpy's a twist  I wish he got that name  Because that's what they felt  In his neck glands  That's the mother and him talking  She's pointing  Go play  Alright well  That's like listening to old people talk  Just noise  Shut up  Shut up you burden 
[03:02:30]  That's what you hear  Just noise noise  Babble noise  George Lucas did try to get this removed  From every fucking possible place  Yeah I know  Like it used to be at the sci-fi conventions  You could buy a VCR copy  And he put the  Tried to put the kibosh on that  I'll bet you though  That even though he probably didn't have much of a hand in this  It's still  Come on you couldn't  Whoever did this  This is just terrible  And then for them to get 
[03:03:00]  The stars of the movie  Yeah  Fucking do that  I mean they got them for these little  Little parts  Apparently Princess Leia was all drugged up  She's trying to sing a song  And she's just fucking  Hammered  I love the whole copy of this  It's really bad  They're doing Star Wars auditions for the new movie  You can do it online  Like you can go  Someone was going to send me the link  And she didn't  But for the new film that they're doing  You can audition on video  Like they have like dialogue 
[03:03:30]  So I was thinking I wanted to  But it has to be in by December 3rd I think  So anyway  It has a link to that  Please email me  Because I would love to  Maybe put in an audition tape  Oh  Yeah what the fuck  Chip Baca  No just whatever  Oh  I used to say Boba Feet  And people would crack up  That is funny  I know  He goes I know  I was watching Star Wars last night  It was on like a sci-fi channel  Or some fucking shit  Whatever it was  And I was just thinking how  How like the new version  The J.J. Abrams version of Star Trek looks 
[03:04:00]  And how the original original Star Wars looked  It's going to be such a huge departure from that  Like because even  Even as technology got better  It was still stupid Lucas  With his fucking mitts in there  And his dumb toys  Even if he wasn't directing it  And stuff like that  And the Jedi toys  And that fucking new hunk of shit  With Hayden Christensen  He had final say  You know  Jar Jar  Yeah  Jar Jar Binks  This is going to be  Like a complete departure  A cool movie  Yeah  I'm very hopeful 
[03:04:30]  He's going to want to make it his own  Yeah  Yeah  Fuck around with  You know  Right  But he's also very good  With keeping  I was going to say tradition  I mean it's going to be traditional  But  Well that's just  It will look the same  But there will be something different  Right  Yeah  No I don't  I think he's going to be  Look like a motherfucking badass  Oh different  Oh fuck yeah  I think he goes all in  And makes him different  Yeah  Absolutely  There are certain things that  He's got to stick to  Just because the purists  Will be like  Fuck him  But then other things  Like you can just make it  So much better 
[03:05:00]  Without Lucas  And his dumb fucking  Paws in it  Chewbacca  What is he tasty  Or something  I think Chewbacca's a sensation  At least something  Well enjoy him  Get used to him  When is that supposed to come out  What  The movie  2015  Wow  I think  Alright we're getting there  I am  I am  Why don't we get the hell out of here 
[03:05:30]  We have a Bobo bit  Bobo bit  I was thinking of playing that Cinderella song today actually  But  Coming home  It's kind of a cool song  You know  I'm not going to plug all my days  Because it's apparently not doing any good  So go to my website  If you want to come see me  If not  Don't fuck yourself  Come on man  Support our shit  That's all we have  Nah I've been on the road too much  You know in the last few years  It's a new hour material  Like what do people want  It's brand new  Brand new shit  Yes  Alright  Alright

[03:09:00]  They charge me  Four hundred dollars  An hour  That was good  Thanks Jenna  Come here Mr. Maloon again  Daddy has something  That needs cleaning  This  Is after  O.P. and Anthony live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Oh those two guys 
[03:09:30]  Might be my favorite  Two people ever  Not O.P. and Anthony  They're very far down  On that list  Not even close to the top  I'm talking about  Whoever those two people  Were in that room  With O.P.  We were just watching  The YouTube video  He posted it  On his page  O.P. Radio  On YouTube  And O.P. was able  To discover  A VHS tape  From I guess  89  Of Sam Kinison  In studio  With Brother Weez  His radio mentor 
[03:10:00]  And there's two  Mystery douchebags  I'll call them  The Masked D-Bags  Who are  In like a little  Producer studio  And they're commenting  On the girls  That are in studio  But it's  It's the worst thing  You've ever heard  Like  And it's the typical  I was talking to  E-Rock about it  During the break  It's the typical  Thing  Where we've all  Met somebody like this  This guy  Because my theory  On the room  Not the film  The room  But the room 
[03:10:30]  That we just saw  Via those YouTube videos  My theory is  That one of those guys  Has been there  For a long time  And he's the one  Who's doing most  Of the talking  And he's making  All the stupid comments  And he's  And he's  You know  He's the one  Who's talking about  Titties being under the shirt  And he's the one going  Oh yeah  Yeah she's good looking  I like good looking  He's that guy  He doesn't have an ounce  Of as they say  Game  With ladies  Like he's not good  With women 
[03:11:00]  But what he does  Is he takes  Young people  Or people who are  New to the office  And he tries to  Convince them  That he's cool  Because everybody  In that office  Has caught on  To this guy  By now  Everybody knows  That he's a lame wad  Okay  Everybody's aware  Of it at this point  But what he does  Is he has to wait  Until somebody new  Comes in  And then try to  Convince that new person  That he's cool  And try to keep 
[03:11:30]  That person away  From everybody else  In the office  Because everybody else  In the office  Is just going to  Tip him off anyway  Opie was talking  About during the break  Before he left  Saying that he  Honestly thought  The guy was cool  But he doesn't  Know if  He's at that age  That he didn't  Know any better  If his perception  Was skewed  Maybe the guy  Was just having  An off day  You know  But I told  I told Opie  I think it's obvious  That Opie also said  Earlier in the tape  He's wearing like a 
[03:12:00]  Station logo hoodie  And when was the  Last time Opie  We had a four day  Break  And Opie  Comes back to the show  To go  Oh great  We're back to  This shithole  So it's been  A long time  Since he would  Wear the call  Letters  On his shirt  He's not exactly  Dennis Falcone  But Opie was still  In that mind frame  Where he's wearing  The call letters  And he's  Excited that he's  In radio  And  And he's looking  To really 
[03:12:30]  Grab the world  By the balls  Yeah I know  Who can grab me  By the balls  That chicken there  The good looking one  Not the fucking  Dog  Woof woof  You know what I'm  Saying  Yeah buddy  Yeah buddy  I could understand  Where Opie was  Like he was  Enthused by the  Whole thing  Cause this guy  Seemed cool  He seemed like  He was having  A good time  But I got to  Imagine if Opie  Had not moved on  From Rochester  Very quickly  After that  He would have  Caught wind of it  Too  Even at a young  Age  Anybody would 
[03:13:00]  I mean  You know it's like  It's like when I was  Interning for Scorch  In Syracuse  If I wasn't  Already such  A little asshole  Even at  However old I was  21  If I wasn't already  Such a piece of shit  I probably would have  Been able to get  Sucked up  In some of his  Bullshit  Cause you could tell  He's just like  Yeah he's got all  These plans  And he starts  Going through them  You know  There's somebody like  That everywhere you go  E-Rock you said  You've dealt  You've dealt with  This before 
[03:13:30]  Yeah I've seen it  And the key thing  For what Opie said  Was that the guy  Was a salesperson  You think so  And I've seen that  When I mean  Just as recently  As when we were  Up at K-Rock  Uh huh  You would see  Some of the guys  And they were very nice  But you could see  That mentality  It's just like  Oh dude  Shut up  866-WOW1-WOW  Is the phone number  So call in  It's after Opie and Anthony live  And yeah that is true  Because you find  With sales guys  These are guys  A lot of them  They're some great sales guys  But as far as 
[03:14:00]  The overall picture goes  The majority of sales guys  Spend the day  In a tie  In a shirt and tie  They're trying to sell  Some product to somebody  While answering to a boss  So they've got to spend  All this time on the phone  Trying to impress somebody  That they're trying  To get to buy something  While at the same time  Trying not to get  Their boss angry  And so they can't  Really do anything  They're just there  To follow the script  And to sell  And so  They go way over the top 
[03:14:30]  Whenever they get  A chance to be a dude  I guess because  They want to prove  That they're just a guy  Like anybody else  And so they start  Saying things like  This guy  Yeah  Yeah  I'll bet  Under the shirt  Is titties  And nipples  And they're the same guy  After the whole event  Is done  They're like  Come on  Let's go get a couple beers  Yeah  It's like dude  It's 2 o'clock  They are  They are  Yeah  It's like 2 a.m.  And the night's been great  I was saying p.m.  Oh  You're like  I don't want  The morning shift  They're like 
[03:15:00]  Come on  Let's get some  No  I'm going home  I thought it was just because  Dude you just told me that  Your preference as far as women goes  Are good looking women  I don't want anything to do with you buddy  Sorry  I'm going home  It's only 2 p.m. bro  I don't  Because they don't want to get home to their family  Because that's where  It's the same deal  Just like their boss tells them what to do all day  Their wife is at home telling them what to do  They got to answer to their little kids  It's a miserable existence  I feel for you people out there  But you got to calm down a little bit  When you get that opportunity 
[03:15:30]  Like I'm not cool  I'm not a cool guy  I don't know how to talk to women  But  I shut my fucking mouth  You know what I mean?  I shut my mouth  Around  When I'm out in public  Unless I'm making fun of somebody  Then I'm okay  Kevin in Philly  Hey Sam  It sounds like  One of your old characters  They say poopy shit  Yeah he does  Just  Just going over the top

Yep  I was gonna say  Jim Brewer was in here today  And what a great way to come back from vacation  Than with Jim Brewer  I swear to God  He always comes in here  And however much time he has  That's how much time he should be in here  If he can be in here the whole show  Be in here the whole show  Because he's electric  He comes in here with these stories  That are unbelievable every time  I don't know  If he realizes 
[03:19:00]  How cool  Like he's living the life  That young Jim Brewer  Would freak out over  He came in here today  And he told a story of  Going camping with James Hetfield  He's going on family trips  With the Hetfields  From Metallica  Jim Brewer has been a metal fan forever  And now he gets to go camping  With the god of metal  It's amazing  Who would you  Eric  As a youngster  If they found out that 
[03:19:30]  Old Eric  Today Eric  Defeated Eric  Depressed Eric  Bloated Eric  Was going camping with somebody  I'm just kind of painting a picture  Horrible  Who would it be?  Who would the James Hetfield moment be for you?  To go camping with  Because I would imagine  That if James Hetfield  I mean not James Hetfield  Jim Brewer  Talked to his 13 year old self  And said  Young self  I just went camping with James Hetfield 
[03:20:00]  Little 13 year old Jimmy  Would be freaking out  Right?  Yeah  So who do you think it would be?  I would have loved  To have gone camping  With  Hulk Hogan  Or Randy Savage  Not together though  The mega powers would collide  Oh my god  That'd be fantastic  Would you do it now though?  Okay now  Going  Forward  Macho Man is dead  So I guess you could sleep  Above his grave  If you wanted to  But Hulk Hogan  Is still alive 
[03:20:30]  And  I mean I was going to say well  But he's still alive  Would you go camping with him  Now?  Like if Hulk Hogan  Came to you and said  Eric brother  I got a Hulkamaniac  Camping trip coming up  Right around the corner  And I need my number one  Hulkamaniac there with me  I need you  Representing  The red  And the yellow  And the training  And the saying your prayers  And the eating your vitamins  And he did his whole spiel  And he went fucking crazy  And he ripped his shirt off  Would you go camping with him?  Hell yes  You would 
[03:21:00]  Oh yeah  Would he even have to go through that whole spiel?  No but I would let him  What if it was just like a  The way that  Like John Stockton basketball camp  When I was a kid  Everybody wanted to go to  John Stockton basketball camp  If it was Hulk Hogan sleepaway camp  And it was all little kids  Except there was no age restriction  So you could go  Would you go?  To a sleepaway camp?  But Hulk Hogan was there  I don't want to go with other people  But you would get your own cabin  Would you be a counselor? 
[03:21:30]  Maybe then  Would you be a counselor?  Would you try to get a job as a counselor  At the Hulk Hogan sleepaway camp?  At Hulk Hogan's campground?  Yeah  Would you be a counselor maniac?  Yeah I would  Counselor maniac  You would  You would try to get that job  Oh yeah  Would he have to pay you?  Room and board is fine  You're a hell of a negotiator  As long as he puts you up  And how long are you willing to stay?  Morning exercises  You're just doing his poses  Counting to five  You just Hulk up 
[03:22:00]  You put your hand by your ear  How long would you stay for?  I'd stay for  How long is camp?  Three months  June, July  Summer camp is three months?  Well maybe two months  I'd do the two months  You would  Yeah  I've never been to camp  So you go  You call up Tim Sabian  And go  Tim  Look  You know I love the show  You know I love my job  I don't want to  I don't want to put any of this  On the back burner  But  An opportunity has come my way  To be a counselor  At Hulk Hogan's 
[03:22:30]  Sleep-a-mania  Sleep-away camp  I need to do this  I need to be that kid at Wembley  I need to do it  Do you think Tim would be like  I understand brother?  Yeah  I don't  I don't  No  I don't think Tim would understand at all  Uh  Freak Dog  Freak Dog in New Jersey  What's up buddy?  Hey guys  Um  I'd really love to do this  Sleep-away camp  With the killer bees  The wrestlers  Why?  What?  Well you know what would be great  They'd put their masks on  And one molest me 
[03:23:00]  And I don't know which one  What about that?  What about that Eric?  It's more like a dream  What if Hulk Hogan puts on a wrestling mask  And molests you?  No  Is that  E-Rock  What if Mr. America molested you?  Wouldn't that be fantastic?  Be honest about it E-Rock  If Hulk Hogan put on a mask  And it was stars and stripes  At night Mr. America just sneaks in  Yeah  And he was just spooning you at first  You'd be okay if he was spooning you  Correct?  No I would not be comfortable with that  If Hulk Hogan was spooning you  You wouldn't be okay with it  No I would not be okay with that  That seems a little hard for me to believe  He's your hero 
[03:23:30]  Sorry brother  How far would you let him go?  I wouldn't go far at all  Would you kiss him on the cheek?  No  What if he said play one right here brother  And pointed to his Hulkamaniac cheek?  No  You wouldn't kiss Hulk Hogan on the cheek?  Give him the boot  No you wouldn't  You couldn't get your foot up that high  To save your fucking life  I could but it wouldn't do anything  You couldn't get your foot up to his knee  Be honest  That's fucking wrong  Would you give him a hug?  I'll give you the boot  Would you give him a hug?  If he asked you to be a hugamaniac?  I'd give the Hulkster a hug  Yeah and what if he said 
[03:24:00]  Now play one here brother  Or play one here's cheek  I'd be like what the fuck's wrong with you?  You wouldn't give him a kiss on the cheek?  No  I don't know who my  Who my camping with buddy would be  I don't know  Rob Zombie  I guess so  I'd go camping with Rob Zombie  He'd tell you like really fucked up  You know like ghost stories  That'd be fun  Yeah  Yeah  He'd tell ghost stories  And then I'd be like  So Rob remember that time when  And just do the Chris Farley thing  I would let Rob Zombie spoon with me  I would think  And he would shit talk white zombie  Yeah he would 
[03:24:30]  I'd get him to  He'd tell you all those stories  I would love that  And so tell me what really happened  Why'd you leave  Cause let's be honest  White zombie was Rob Zombie  Wasn't it?  It was  Wasn't it?  And he'd be like  Yeah let me tell you something  About those fucking assholes  It'd be great  But we'd be in the spoon position  I told you about when I saw  White zombie right?  Because that's part of summer camp  I don't think so  I saw them at David Letterman  Oh yeah  They set off the fire alarms  That they had to actually  End the show out on the street  Cause they exit everybody  From the theater  I can't believe you don't think 
[03:25:00]  Spooning is part of summer camp  I've never been to summer camp  So you don't know  No  They tried to make me go to camp once  And I was gone within the week  It was a fat camp?  No  Be honest  It was a baseball camp  Okay  Okay  It was a quote unquote baseball camp  But was it one of those camps  Where it was heavy on the exercise  Low on the food intake?  No it was baseball camp  Be honest  Lee Mazzilli  Bud Harrelson  Baseball camp  Bud Harrelson?  Bud Harrelson  Oh  It was a Mets thing  But it was  I just don't like camp 
[03:25:30]  What was the average weight  Of the camp kid?  Be honest  They're like real  They're like  Seven, eight years old  Were they fat kids though?  That's what I'm asking  No  No fat kids  Alright  Anymore  Or  I'm asking  I'm asking at the beginning of camp  Not at the end  Okay  DJ Who Kid just walked in  What's up buddy?  I see you're talking about  The worst interview I've had  In my career  The guy  Remember I told you?  Who?  Rob Zombie was like my worst  Oh yeah  You had a tough time with Rob Zombie  Do you think G-Rock went to fat camp  When he was a kid? 
[03:26:00]  No  He's not fat  I was never fat  Until I worked here  Oh  Oh  He's not considered fat  He's like thick  You know how  When we see black chicks  And they'll be  Yo you're thick son  Right you start licking your lips  And everything  Let me ask you who could  We were talking  Because Jim Brewer was in here  We were talking about  People who  If you were hanging  If your like 13 year old self  Found out you were hanging with him  They'd be like  Oh that's fucking awesome  Like for me  If my 13 year old self  Found out that like 
[03:26:30]  I was texting with Mick Foley  He'd be like  That's amazing  Yeah I will  Jim Brewer the comedian  He was in here talking about  Going to camp in Africa  With James Hetfield  From Metallica  No  Yes  Get out of here  Yes  E-Rock wants to go on a camping trip  With Hulk Hogan  I don't know what that is  But I think he can get it done  E-Rock I think you're closer now  Than you've ever been  He wants to do  For some reason  He wants to go to  Sleepaway camp with Hulk Hogan  What?  I don't know why  No it started off with camping  Look I don't know E-Rock 
[03:27:00]  I can't get into the whole thing again  We just got into the whole thing  Spooning  Sleepaway with his wife  I can't get into it  Yeah he hasn't brought up his wife once  And he's talking about  Spooning with Hulk Hogan  I don't know what his deal is  I haven't said any of that  But is there somebody like  Like if  I don't even know with you  If your 13 year old self  Was like  Oh you get to hang out with 50 Cent  Nah I'd probably like Eddie Murphy  Eddie Murphy  Have you ever gotten to meet Eddie Murphy?  I met Eddie Murphy before  Michael Jackson would be a big one  Yeah but not with his reputation  He might finger me  So you were aware of that  Even as a kid 
[03:27:30]  But when I met him as an adult  It was different  When I was a kid  I wanted to  You know  You wanted to meet Michael Jackson  No I wanted Eddie Murphy  Oh okay  Because I was about to say  I'm sure Michael Jackson  Wanted to meet you  When you were a kid  Yeah that's reversed  That's a whole other thing  That's a whole other deal  So Eddie Murphy would be the one  You go camping with him?  Yeah because he used to have  Leather outfits  Like the leather top  And the leather pants  Right  Crazy so imagine us  In the woods with that  Looking good  Beavers love leather  And you think you'd be  In leather too?  Oh yeah  Little kid leather  Like oh shit 
[03:28:00]  Look at me  Okay  Leather tent  Yeah  That'd be crazy  Would you spoon with him?  Yes  Eddie Murphy  That's okay  That's what I'm saying  Like he  I can relate to  E-Rock shit  Because Hulk Hogan  Is like  The Jesus Christ  To you guys  Yeah but you know what  Like Eddie Murphy  Is still  On that level  To me  But now  Hulk Hogan  Like it seems realistic  That E-Rock  Would go camping  With Hulk Hogan  You know what I mean?  It could happen  Like Hulk Hogan  Is not  Eddie's brother  If you found out 
[03:28:30]  That Hulk Hogan  Started his own  Sleepaway camp  Yeah  You wouldn't be that surprised  I wouldn't be surprised  Like that  No you wouldn't  But if Eddie Murphy  If Eddie Murphy  Was like  Yo man I got a leather tent  That's crazy  You'd be like  What?  I'm like what?  Right  They'd go what?  Exactly  Exactly  I'd spoon with Eddie Murphy too  But I'm a little homo though  Only because he's Eddie Murphy  Did you spoon with Michael?  No I did not  Okay  We were adults  I was just asking  Both of you  That's the problem  Would you let him spoon  And then laugh in your ear? 
[03:29:00]  I think I would  With an Eddie laugh?  You're doing the Eddie laugh  You have to  I would  The other thing  I'm glad that you're here  Who could  Because the other thing  That Jim Brewer  Was talking about  Was  Jim Brewer  Has a 14 year old daughter  And  He's got  What are you  Michael Jackson?  14  Oh I'm sorry  I thought you said 18  And now  He didn't  Those two things  Don't even sound alike  I'm like  I'm like  Well  He said now  He's got to worry  About his daughter 
[03:29:30]  Starting to date  Starting to fuck you mean  No date  I said date  Be respectful  God damn it  Does she have Spanish?  I don't think so  Alright  So she should be okay  Back to the date  Yeah  But she's going up to him  And saying  Like I want to start dating  All my friends  Are trying to date  I want to date  And Jim Brewer  Is telling her  You can't date  That's the rule  If you're 14  You can't date  You have kids  How old is your oldest son?  14 also  14  And you came in here 
[03:30:00]  Saying that there were people  On his Facebook page  Talking about blowjobs  I was like yo  Go for it right?  Get it going  Right  Exactly  Get a tiger  Because I'm sitting there  Thinking while Jim Brewer  Is talking  That  When I was 14  My parents told me  I couldn't date  But it was just  A point of fact  I was like yeah I know  I don't have the ability  Are you ugly?  You have pimples or something?  No pimples  But I was very small  I had just a big head  And it was just awkward  Believe it or not 
[03:30:30]  Who kid  I wasn't always this  Suave debonair man  You see in front of your face  I know man  You're like so fucking hot right now  You think so?  No  I guess not  Weird with the mouth thing  And now this  But  But you said you had a small cock  When you were young  That's not what I said  You just said that  No I didn't  E-Rod  Isn't that what you just said?  That's what I heard  No it's not  That's ridiculous  You were small  I was a small person  Oh  I guess the cock matched  I don't know for sure  I'm a bigger person now though  Yeah I hope 
[03:31:00]  But  Like  I didn't know how to talk  To any of these girls  Like it's amazing to me  That a young girl  Can be like  Yeah I choose to start dating now  There was no for me  There was no  I choose to start dating  It was  Whenever a girl  Will look at me  Is when I would like  To start dating  I was like 17  18 years old  Gotta get that ass  Yeah  But there was no  Sort of  Early teens  I was so awkward  Around girls  But you probably  Got it before me  I got mine at 19  19 
[03:31:30]  So you were awkward too  But I had no gear  I had pimples  I was rock  Right  Well yeah me too  Like I didn't know  What cool it was  I was wearing size large  Wrestling t-shirts  To school every day  Plastic coats and shit  Right  That's why  Eddie Murphy was my idol  Because he had a leather  Outfit  Right  Straight leather  Yeah  And you were like  Yeah that's cool  I remember like in 6th grade  Because that's when you really start thinking about dressing cool  And I was sitting there  Going  Okay  How do I dress cool  Because girls  That's when you start becoming a warrior  You're like  Look at these girls  Hanging out with these guys 
[03:32:00]  That look way older than me  And are much cooler than me  I could recognize that  And I go  Okay well why is that  Why do they look older than me  Why are they cooler than me  Must be because of the way they dress  Not because  I'm a fucking midget  You're really that short  Must be  Yeah I was real short  Must be because  I was like  I wasn't 5 foot by the time  I was a freshman in high school  Damn  Oh it was awful  Damn  Like all the girls were like  Oh Sam he's so cute  But not cute like  Oh I want to date him 
[03:32:30]  Like  Oh  You know what else is cute  This little schnoodle over here  It's  It's part poodle  Part schnauzer  Were you on some stand by me shit  Like you look like that  Like back in the day  Which one  Not the chubby kid  That was E-Rod  I wasn't chubby at all  I was rail thin  I look like  He's thick man  I look like a tiny little Ethiopian boy  Except white  Yo for real  I look like Starvin Marvin  Except with a little afro on top 
[03:33:00]  I can't see that man  You're like a  You're so debonary  Thank you  Thank you  With my Yeezus t-shirt on  Yeah you gotta  Yeezus t-shirt on  But I remember going  And like looking around  Cause it's not like  I was wearing  Like I had no idea  What else to wear  Besides that  So  Oh who kid  Are you needed  Yeah I'm needed real quick  Well let me tell you  That's when I was like  Oh  What am I gonna  Mom next time you're at the store  Can you pick me up  Some Tommy Hilfiger t-shirts 
[03:33:30]  People still wear that stuff  I don't know  But she was like  Oh yeah sure  She never did  She thought way better of it  She was like  You're not gonna be able  To pull that shit off  You little idiot  How about we get your stuff  From the WWF catalog  But what's wrong with Jim  With his daughter dating though  They don't know what  Fuckin  They fuck at 14  Because when you're  A father of a daughter  You don't want your daughter  Dating  You know  These fuckin scumbags  Like your son  Like doggy style  What happens  I don't know what positions 
[03:34:00]  Scissors  But what happens  If a little 14 year old  Half black  Half Asian kid  Walks up to his door  With a crack dealer sweatshirt  Or a trap lord hoodie on  He's gotta suck that dick  Yeah  That's my son  Yeah he doesn't want  Any part of that  Yeah I know  But it's hard raising kids now  I would imagine  At the end of the day  He's got his dick sucked  Whether he likes it or not  Who your son  Yeah I couldn't argue with him  I was like alright  It's probably easier  When you have a little boy  You don't have to worry  About his  His innocence 
[03:34:30]  Being taken from him  There's no STDs  In the 14 year old  In the area  Well not yet no  18 is when the STD  Starts popping  Not for me  So it's clean right now  There was no STDs for me  You know why  Why  Because I was not  Leaving my room  You should have seen  You should have seen  How happy I was  The day  Because I'd sit there  Freshman year of high school  Was when kids started  Going out every weekend  Like you'd go out  You'd go to the movie  You'd go out with your friends  But I only had two friends  And they sucked  So we never went out anywhere  I just stayed at home  And by me 
[03:35:00]  Yeah  I just stayed at home all day  Or I ran down the train tracks  And looked for dead bodies  But I'd be sitting there  I'd be  Every Sunday night  I would have this horrible pressure  Of  What am I going to say  I did this weekend  Because there'd always be  Some girl  Shit  Right  There'd always be some girl  That was like  What'd you do this weekend  And I'd be like  Why the fuck would you ask me  That humiliating question  Atari nigga  Yeah what am I going to say  I sat home and played wrestling toys  I'm 15 years old  I'm too old for that shit  The day I found out 
[03:35:30]  That's crazy  I was sitting there  I'm searching  I'm searching  I'm like  Wait a minute  And one time  I heard somebody say it  I heard  I was eavesdropping  On the conversation  And the girl goes  What'd you do this weekend  And the guy goes  Oh not much  I just hung out  I was like  Hung out  That sounds cool  When that guy says it  That's crazy  Except you know  I didn't realize  I started saying it  Because that guy sounded cool  Sounds cool when he says it  I'm going to start saying it  Anytime this girl asks me  What did you do this weekend  Oh not much  I just hung out 
[03:36:00]  But when you do that  Every single Monday  Oh shit  It starts to become apparent  I came in a girl  To say that  You were hanging out  With your parents  I probably didn't even know  What came in a girl was  I did that the first time  I told you  That's why the chick  Got pregnant  I thought you know  Your first time  You're 19  Yeah  First time having sex  But I thought  Women get pregnant randomly  Like you come in them  And then  The pelican comes through later  Right you didn't know  Dropping that little nigga off  Right  Right  Little brown pelican comes down  I'll be right back man 
[03:36:30]  Where you going?  I'm just going around the corner  So five minutes  I'll be right back  Oh okay okay  Yeah  Come back  We're coming to girl  Yeah yeah  I'm just going to go around the corner  I'm just going to hang out  For a couple minutes  I'll be right back  Just to hang out  Alright come back  You're welcome back  But yeah  I mean that  I thought it was going to be  A life changer  And it was for a couple of weeks  When I could just say  Oh yeah  Just hanging out  But they saw right through that  In no time  And I didn't have any  Like I didn't know 
[03:37:00]  How to hang out with people  I already didn't know  I didn't know what people did  In their free time  I didn't know what was cool to do  Like hey  You want to  Come over to my house  And watch wrestling tapes  That's my only point of reference  I was a senior in high school  Before I broke out of any of this  Eric  Were you like a cool guy  In high school?  No  But I  Didn't have any problems  With anybody either  What do you mean?  I just did my  Kind of my own thing  Just like right now  You just went home  You went down to your basement  You watched cartoons 
[03:37:30]  And then if people gave you shit  You were just like  Whatever  I got to  Soda stream at home  Exactly  That's it  Yeah  Did you have a  Did you have friends?  Oh yeah  I got along with a lot of people  But did you have friends?  Yeah  Like that came over to your house?  Mmhmm  Were they like  Freaks and geeks?  Yeah I guess you could say that  Dungeons and Dragons friends?  No no no  None of that  What'd you guys do?  We  Wasn't the cool thing to do  But we used to go out at night  And like 
[03:38:00]  Vandalize  That's cool  What do you mean  It's not the cool thing to do?  That's the fucking coolest thing  I ever heard  You come out of your mouth  There was a golf course near us  And we used to just  You know  Sneak in  Because it was at night time  You just crawl on your stomach  And go to the sand traps  And break all the rakes  See that's cool  Throw the flags  That's so much cooler  Than anything I was doing  I was doing nothing cool  Nicole's here  Hi  This is like a revolving door today  Really?  And I gotta tell you  The titties are looking huge  Are they?  Yeah  Well I'm pregnant  They are big  They're just full of milk and shit  My God 
[03:38:30]  Guy's big bites  I know  Well I think he was  He was inappropriate enough  Without me talking  Without me showing the boobies  I turned on my fucking TV  On Sunday morning  Yeah  Trying to relax  And all I see is the  Cheese ball morning mashup  And Guy Fieri hanging out  The crew  Yeah  Yeah the crew  And like  Guy Fieri  It's funny  Because I know you all  Right?  Yeah  And it couldn't have been more clear  That he wasn't actually your friends  He kept  He was calling you Nicky  Yeah I don't know

It's from the United States of America  Okay sorry  And here we pronounce an R  Like an R  Not like a D  Yeah sorry  Yeah Matt was not pleased with that 
[03:39:30]  He actually got up  And was like  I'm not watching this shit  I'm like your wife is on  He was like  Yeah well Guy wants to bang my wife  So I don't want to watch anymore  The whole time  I don't think he does  The whole show  It was just a weird show  Because it was supposed to be a competition  Yeah  But Guy was just making all the food anyway  Yeah  It was like  It was under the guise  No pun intended  Of a competition  And the whole time  He's just flirting with Nicole  Yeah  There's three dudes  And Nicole  And he's like  Oh wait till you see Nicole make this pesto  On these nuts 
[03:40:00]  And I was like  It's the food network  He was giving the other three guys shit  Because they didn't know certain parts of food  And then Nicole's like  I don't know any of this  Oh it's okay  Come on over here  But it was like  The shittiest  Stand next to me  It was the most cheese ball flirting  Like everybody knows  Yeah  If he's like really  Like flirting with you  Yeah  He should be  Negging you  You know what I mean  Negging me  Negging  What does that mean  Like negative  Like saying something  That's like  Kind of a slam  Oh  Like oh Nicole  This food is really good  At least that's what I thought

[03:41:00]  Guy Fieri on this show  It was in reference to him  Getting into a lover's quarrel  With his hairstylist  Who is a man  So  It's not all bad news  For Guy Fieri  Maybe you guys said  That it was a lover's quarrel  I think they were just  Drunk and being stupid  Well it came across  As a lover's quarrel  Really that's the way  It came across to us  I'm glad you're here Nicole  I know  I really missed you  That's why I came in  I missed you too  I was just talking about  When did you start dating?  Matt?  No not Matt  Dating?  I'm done with Matt 
[03:41:30]  You just said  When did you start dating?  Yeah when did you start dating people?  Oh dating in general  You really are  There's just tumbleweeds  Going through those years  Sorry  Sorry  Dating  Like really dating  I think my first real boyfriend  Was maybe like  In like high school  Yeah  Yeah I mean like  I like kissed a boy and stuff  And like did stupid things  But nothing like a real boyfriend  We were talking about Jim Brewer  He was in here  And his daughter's 14  Wow  And she's asking like  I want to start dating now  And I was saying that  When I was 
[03:42:00]  Throughout my teenage years  There was no  I want to start  It was all  I want to start dating  It just wasn't an option  Yeah but I mean  It's not like  I mean what is dating  Really when you're that old  Having a girl talk to you  Would have been good enough for me  Oh Sam  Like you tell me  Freshman year of high school  Yeah  If you're asking me  What did I do  Every Monday  You're like  Oh what'd you do this weekend?  Yeah what'd you do this weekend?  Let's pretend we're back in high school  Okay alright  So Sam what'd you do this weekend?  Oh not much  I just hung out 
[03:42:30]  And did what?  Hung out  Oh fuck  Follow up questions  Oh no  Because I would have to try to figure out ways  To not say nothing  I sat at home  In my parents house  And watched wrestling  And played with wrestling toys  And just was  Way below  The level of maturity  I should have been at  At that point  You didn't get your dick sucked  For a long time  No  No  I was deep into high school  Before that started happening  Okay  That's alright  I was probably 18 
[03:43:00]  17  Yeah  18 before that started happening  Wow  Was it like huge for you?  Do you like remember  Your first blowjob?  Do you not remember  The first time you blew somebody?  I do  Well I would assume  It's huge for everybody  Yeah that's true  That's true  Except for the girl  Who was blowing me  But um  Huge  You know  Really small  You're very funny  You should get a radio show  Thank you very much  Um  That it was probably  Never an issue for you  Giving  Giving a blowjob  Dating  Yeah no it was not an issue  Plus you put out  Yeah  From the get go 
[03:43:30]  I mean it wasn't like  I wasn't like a full whore  How many people did you sleep with  In high school?  In high school?  Yeah  Two or three  That's it  Yeah  I had boyfriends  I had like serious boyfriends  When did you start to go wild?  I  Right after college  It was over  After college  Yeah because in college  I had a serious boyfriend too  And right at the end  When we broke up  It was like  I was off  And then into my 20s  It was all over for me  So were there guys  Probably in high school and college  That were coming up to you  And you were like  Oh I have a boyfriend  Sorry  Yeah  And they were just pining over you  I don't know if they were pining 
[03:44:00]  They were probably pining  The way Guy Fieri was  Oh Jesus  And then  Come to find out  Yeah  Four years later  You're just sleeping with anybody  With a pulse  Well that's not exactly accurate  Exactly  Or is it close though?  No I  I was  I was enjoying my  My youth  Your vagina  My vagina was enjoying  Every second of  I was just living it up  Yeah  I'm not judging  Once you get married  You want to never look back  And be like  I regret that  I never got to do that  I never got to fuck  That kind of guy 
[03:44:30]  Or that kind of girl  You want to know  That you got it all  Out of your system  And you want to make sure  That your husband  Does regret your past  Yeah  I wish she hadn't slept  With that kind of guy  Yeah  I wish she hadn't slept  Right  Right  I'm getting texts  From your husband  Yeah he's probably  Not really pleased  With this conversation  She's a fucking liar  Your husband just texted me  She's a fucking liar  Eleven cocks in high school  There was not eleven  Was there eleven  There was not eleven  Be honest  No  I seriously dated  Three guys  And slept with all of them 
[03:45:00]  So after college  Is when you just decided  To just dip into  The variety bag  Yeah man  I really went buck wild  And I have zero regrets about it  I had a great time  Is there any type of person  Young, old, black, white  Latino  Yeah  I don't know  Alien  I've tried them all  That you haven't had sex with  No  Creep  No I didn't  Do you have sex with a fat guy  Maybe someone  A little bit large  Not full on fat  Not like I can't find  His penis fat  Right  But maybe a little bit overweight  Did you ever have sex 
[03:45:30]  With somebody with a tiny tiny penis  Pinky yeah  Really  Yeah  And I  His story was the next day  He wouldn't leave my apartment  So I had to make up a lie  And say that like my friend  Had an emergency  And I had to go  I couldn't  I couldn't get him out  And I just was like  Having nightmares  About how small  I couldn't even feel it  I was like  Is it in  It was awful  You just had to wait  Until he came  Oh  I don't want to think about it  Even if he gives me  The heebie-jeebies  Was it like  Like if he's jacking off  Is he using fingers  Or are you using a whole hand  I just remember  I didn't even know  If it was hard 
[03:46:00]  Because it was so small  Was it like  When you roll up silly putty  I don't want to talk about it  Did he achieve climax  Maybe  He probably did  I just kept looking over  At my closet  Like is it over yet  Now is this a guy  Who looked  Like could you tell this  Going in  Or did you assume  That there was going to be  Something to work with  I thought there was going to be  Something to work with  I mean he was kind of a hipster  He was  Was he confident  Yeah  Hmm  In what  I don't know  Because this has to be  Something that  I always wonder  Guys with a penis  That's too big  Or one that's too small  They have to know  That there's an issue  With  I would think so 
[03:46:30]  Right  Somebody would have  Alerted them to it  Right  Or at least like  You look at a porno  And it's like  Nobody's going to have it  That big  Yeah  But if it's like  The size of one of his balls  Like doesn't he get embarrassed  Yeah  When he pulls down his pants  I would think so  Did he seem embarrassed  No  He was like  You're going to love this  And if you're not  I am  So it doesn't matter  Exactly what happened Sam  It's awful man  You took on a very masculine role  In that scenario  Yeah man  It was not  It was not one of my  Proudest moments  Do you usually  Do you usually take on  A masculine role like that 
[03:47:00]  Like next morning  Goodbye  At the time  A little  A little bit  Yeah  At the time  A little bit  Except for with Matt  Because Matt was like  Your husband  See I'll call you  And then never called  See that's  Negging  Oh now I understand  What negging is  You're used to all these guys  Yeah  Fawning over you  Right  And this is a lesson  For all the guys listening  This is something  That I had to learn eventually  Yeah  Because I married way  Over my head  God she's beautiful  I love her  And I went from being  The guy who had to  Figure out a way to say  I didn't do anything  Exactly  I've been there 
[03:47:30]  Right  But the whole reason  That that worked with him  Yeah  Was because  He is a sweetheart of a man  Yeah  So you have to be nice  To the girl eventually  Or like in private  Right  But if you see guys  Fawning all over a girl  And Nicole had it set up  Where guys would  Because she gave up  This vibe  Like I'm too good  Blah blah blah  Like fuck you  You were there  Yeah  Okay  Yeah I can tell  Okay  And so the guys  Would be all over  Plus  But they also knew  You know  You talk a big game  But you will give it up 
[03:48:00]  Right  So they'd be all over you  Yeah  And all these guys  Are in love with you  And you're like  Goodbye  See you later  We're done here  Matt's like  Your husband  Is going  She doesn't have anybody  Being like  Yeah  Bye  No you go  Yeah  And that drove you crazy  Yeah I hated it  Right  I don't like that one bit  But that's how you were  Treating all these guys  I know  I feel bad about it  A little bit  Do you or not really  Not really  No  Because everything  Worked out fine  Didn't it  But I have to say  That I feel bad about it  Do you still talk to the guy  That had a micropenis  I do not  I never talked to him again  Never  Like he called a few times 
[03:48:30]  Was that a direct result  Of the penis  It was 100%  Wow  Yeah  I couldn't even work with it  It's not like  You know some things  Like when you  Are dating a guy  And something weird  Happens when you're being intimate  Like you can maybe work with it  Did you blow him  I think  I think I tried  It was blurry  I was super wasted  Yeah  Yeah  But it was probably  Just like  Yeah I don't even  Really want to think about it  Like it's actually  Traumatizing a little bit  Like you have to be  Really delicate  Like when you're almost  Done with a lollipop  You don't want to bite it  But it's going to break 
[03:49:00]  At any moment  You're almost at the gum  Because it's this tiny  Right  Right  Just like that  It's this tiny little  Thing at the end  Oh god  You're sick  So you were mad about it  I was really mad about it  Because it was like  I feel like  I wasted a notch  I can't get out of this  Our clothes are off  At that point it was like  You had enough notches  For Sally Struthers  To be wearing that belt  You know  Really Sam  I thought so  Really  That's the idea I was getting  I don't know for sure  Sally Struthers  She's a big woman  She is  That was a weird reference 
[03:49:30]  That's the first fat woman  I thought of  I don't know what's going on  In my head  I would have gone with  Like Paula Deen  Or something  Okay  That's a little more  A little more topical  Maybe I need to spend  More time with the mashup  Maybe  Maybe I'm spending a lot of time  With some gentlemen  Who are a little older  Than the people  Who are hosting  The morning mashup  Perhaps  But Sally Struthers  Is a pop culture reference  Nonetheless  Okay  My bad  Yeah  I  It was  I just was  It was annoying  Is Kirstie Alley better?  Kirstie Alley is even better  Than Paula Deen  Because she fluctuates  Is the only thing  But for the most part  She's fat  And plus  You'd probably know  Based on the joke 
[03:50:00]  Where I was going with that  I got it  You probably didn't think  I was thinking about  Skinny Kirstie Alley  I did not think that  It's not  Look who's talking  No  Not back in the day  You know  She used to be like  A major coke head  I wasn't thinking  About her coke days  Is that right  Bad  Yeah  She's still very open about it  Cocaine  Maybe she should have  Stuck with it  She's addicted to lunch  Now though  Yeah  So  It didn't do anyone  Any good  It's really bad news  But so you were  You were mad about it  It added a notch  Yeah added a notch  And I felt like  You know at that time  Because you're like  When you're kind of  A party girl  And you're crazy  And you're going out 
[03:50:30]  It's like he wasted  A night of mine  Like I could have been  Out with my girls  I could have been out  With another guy  I could have been  You could have gotten  A big juicy one  I could have gotten  A big juicy one  And isn't that  Isn't that the dream  That every girl should have  That's what it's all about  If anybody  Is wondering  Whether or not  Now is the time  To let their daughter  Start dating  I would assume  Based on listening  To you today  They will not be  Doing that anytime soon  I hope Jim Brewer  Is not listening  Because that means  His poor daughter  Is never going to  Get to date  After listening to me  No I wouldn't think so  And she shouldn't 
[03:51:00]  Quite frankly  Do you miss the wild days  I do miss the wild days  You do  I  Because I remember  You coming in  Before you got married  Not coming in  Yeah  But being in the studio  And saying  That you were  A little nervous  About getting married  Yeah  Because it was just  Going to be the one  Dick  Yeah well so was he  You have  No  He was worried  About just having one  Oh  Vagina  Vagina  Okay okay  Yeah but I mean  That's out  Any guy  I feel like 
[03:51:30]  Yeah yeah  That is  That's just the way  Guys are  Right  For you it's a little  Different  Like you don't hear  Too often a woman  Being like oh  All this cock  That's going to be  Just flying by me  They don't say it  But they think it  They do  They think it  Has it been tough  No  I'm  Maybe at certain points  It was tough  Like when I was really  Mad at him  I was like god  I'd love to go out  And just bang someone  But  Have you  No  Not yet  No not ever  I would never do that  Good  That was a test  I'm in love  That was a test  Madly  Madly in love  Yeah 
[03:52:00]  What if he was a celebrity  Chef with spiked hair  Oh no  What if Guy Fieri  Like Guy Fieri  Is a TV star  What if he  Propositioned you  What if he  Cornered you  In his backyard  And been like  Yo  I know we're just  Rolling around for TV  But what's up  For real  What if he did  What if he did  What if he did  Whoa  Whoa  I mean I'm not saying  That he did  But what if he did  But what if he did  Yeah  What do you think  He would have said  Hypothetically  Where's your husband  Guy Fieri
