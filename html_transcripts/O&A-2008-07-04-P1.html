<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a studio guest, Roland, recounting a bizarre encounter with Bill Clinton at a Starbucks.  Clinton allegedly cut in line, briefly embraced Roland, and then rushed to the restroom, prompting humorous speculation from the hosts and Roland about Clinton's subsequent activities.  This was followed by a less-than-successful attempt by Roland to sing "Ave Maria" as a tribute to the recently deceased Luciano Pavarotti, which devolved into laughter and mockery.

Comedian D.L. Hughley then joined the show in studio.  After initially downplaying and then openly mocking a song they'd played, the conversation shifted to political correctness and censorship, triggered by a caller's story about a Michigan coffee shop renaming itself from "Beaners" to "Big B's".  This sparked a discussion about the perceived hypocrisy of focusing on minor word choices while ignoring larger societal issues like single motherhood and violence, with Hughley contributing his perspective on racial slurs and societal problems.  The discussion included an anecdote about O.J. Simpson and a remembrance of Johnny Cochran.

The show featured a comedic bit about a Long Island man's chaotic moped ride, followed by a call from an Australian listener who discussed past show appearances and transitioned into a discussion about the treatment of horses in Central Park horse-drawn carriages, veering into humorous and offensive tangents.

A significant portion of the show centered around a commercial for "Mr. Bucket," a children's toy.  The hosts mocked the jingle, speculating on its possible double entendre, and included humorous tangents about Oscar De La Hoya and the game's mechanics.  This segued into a darkly comedic auction of deceased sports figures' body parts and memorabilia, including Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, and others, punctuated by offensive jokes and listener participation.  Further calls and rambling discussions ensued, covering parenting, the reliability of sayings, and the US dollar's value relative to the Canadian dollar.  Bret Michaels' association with the "worst of Opie and Anthony" was mentioned.

The show also included a discussion about Rich Voss's baby's sleeping arrangements, with listener calls offering parenting advice.  This transitioned into offensive jokes about a swastika in a cornfield and Bill O'Reilly's perceived racism, followed by more offensive jokes about family members' body parts.  A phone interview with "Mr. DVD," an expert on upcoming DVD releases, was plagued by significant technical difficulties, leading to crude and offensive humor from the hosts during the repeated interruptions and eventual rescheduling of the interview.  The technical problems persisted until the segment's end.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things, some people don't want you to say this, some people don't want you to say that, some people think if you mention some things they might happen, some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst, the worst, you're listening to the worst, not the best, the absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  We got Roland coming into the studio, where's his song?  When you need radio, he's the one that you call. 
[00:00:30]  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small.  The one you can count on the book, a guest for a session, but ends every single sentence he says in a question.  No pronunciation, soft-spoken and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic and he crumbles.  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonadeus, bonadeus, check him out Friday-wide.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  I mean, that action, suspense. 
[00:01:00]  The beauty of the Roland rap is right after that energy, you get this lump.  But I was watching him as the song was playing and he didn't look happy.  No.  He kind of had his head down.  He was just...  Because he even knows how awful he is.  Oh, Roland.  I know.  Hi, Roland.  How are you?  I'm well.  We all got an email yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  I went to Starbucks and McClinton. 
[00:01:30]  Now, you went to Starbucks.  Yeah, I was coming looking for apartments to move into.  So I can't...  You went to Starbucks to look for an apartment?  No, no.  I came back from Brooklyn.  No.  Little cakes.  He's going to live where they put the little cakes.  He's got two cinnamon cakes and a Roland.  Don't mind us.  I mean, I was just waiting in line and I was next.  I didn't know what I wanted. 
[00:02:00]  Like, what do you want?  I go, I don't know.  So I was looking and I just felt somebody tap me.  He goes, do you mind if I cut in line?  I was like, I don't care.  And then I looked up and it was Clinton.  How many people were in line, by the way?  Probably six, five, six.  You couldn't wait for six people?  Did they...  He's the most powerful man.  No, because everybody was, like, pulling out their cell phones, trying to get pictures  with them.  Was he okay with that?  Yeah, he took pictures, signed autographs.  Why didn't you get a picture with the president?  I had to go...  The ex-president.  Bathroom.  You know what you should have told him?  I had to go to the bathroom. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, well, you'll get the picture the next time.  Yeah, next time you see him.  Dude, I'd bump into him.  Dude, cut, double cut.  I would have made him cut, double cut.  What's cut, double cut?  Remember cut, double cut?  Where your friend would come up online, and he says, can I cut?  And then he cuts in front of you, which has to be okay with everyone behind you, because  he's cutting in front of you.  And you say, cut, double cut.  And then you go in front of him.  So what you're actually doing is letting your friend cut the guy behind you. 
[00:03:00]  Cut, double cut, the worst thing ever.  And you're like, you can't cut, double cut.  You just cut me.  No, it's cut, double cut.  Oh, sorry.  You just what me?  Cut, double cut.  I'm saying cut, double cut.  See, Tim heard it, too.  Cut, double cut, you c***.  I catch it down the hall.  Wait a minute.  That was a little iffy.  Yeah, that was close.  See, that one you really see.  He walked over to the Park Meridian afterwards, signing, taking pictures of those people.  Did he stay at the Park Meridian?  I don't know.  Is he still in town? 
[00:03:30]  Wow.  Should be.  Wait, did he go into the parker?  He went into the parker.  Oh, that means he's staying there.  What if he had breakfast?  That's good.  I like how you just give away the security of...  An ex-president.  One of the ex-presidents of the United States.  He might have walked through there.  Yeah, he probably met somebody there.  Or he walked through.  Met somebody at a hotel?  What are you speculating?  Wow.  You heard it here first.  Roland's saying that the ex-president is having an affair.  Steamy, hot affair at the Park Meridian Hotel.  While his wife is running for the presidency.  Wow.  Yeah.  So wait, Roland, he taps you and he goes, can I cut? 
[00:04:00]  What do you say?  Sure.  And then he orders his coffee.  He goes, can you get this kid something?  And I said, I guess I'll take a cocktail.  This kid?  This kid?  Did he call you a kid?  Well, because everybody else behind me was like 80 years old.  Did he...  You had the urge to go to the bathroom?  Well, it's just like once he ordered, he puts his arm around and people are asking  questions like, hey, how are you?  And then one of the guys goes, can you take a picture with me?  He goes, sure.  And then I head to the bathroom.  You head right to the bathroom?  I had to take a huge... 
[00:04:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I have nothing to say to a politician.  Like, hey, good bill.  Good bill.  I don't know what else.  Yeah, but I mean, how about hi?  I guess...  Well, how about can I have a picture?  How about, are you enjoying New York?  I don't know, something.  I got nothing for politicians.  I just like...  Well...  All right.  Bringing back memories, you know, being on the road, campaign trail, because I've seen  him with his wife on a couple of these things.  It's like, you know, does it make you want to get back into the fray?  Hey, there are a few things you could ask that man, instead of going, excuse me, I got 
[00:05:00]  a duty.  How about we do a little play acting with Roland?  Yeah?  All the presidents.  Like, let's...  I mean, do you have a game?  I don't know.  Like, all right, President Bush is at Starbucks.  What would you say to President Bush?  Wow.  Do you have an opportunity to talk to him?  Anything.  Go ahead.  Hey.  Enjoy your coffee.  How about not being controversial? 
[00:05:30]  How about Jimmy Carter?  He's online.  He taps you on the shoulder.  You're like, oh my God, that's Jimmy Carter.  Hey, I heard you got a book out.  Nice.  A book out?  A book out.  He has a book.  Oh, a book out.  Oh, a book out.  You should enunciate when you're speaking with them.  What about the great communicator?  What would you say to the great communicator?  Ronald Reagan.  Obviously dead, but he's online.  He taps you on the shoulder.  What?  I met him as a little kid, yeah.  You met Reagan?  Reagan. 
[00:06:00]  And Bush Sr.?  Carter and Powell and Al Gore.  And how many pictures do you have of these people?  Because when you work at SNL, my dad had friends who were politicians.  How was the duty when you met Ronald Reagan?  I mean, I was this kid.  All I told him was I was hungry.  Of course.  Yes.  That hasn't stopped.  Did you get pictures?  That won't stop for years.  My mom has a Reagan picture.  Wait, you've met five U.S. or four U.S. presidents? 
[00:06:30]  Just Reagan, Carter, Clinton, Bush Sr.?  Yeah.  That's four U.S. presidents, and you don't have pictures of any of them?  What a waste.  Just one.  Just one.  But you have the memories, right?  What's up with this Forrest Gump thing that happens to you?  I don't know.  You call it your Forrest Gump moment when you meet politicians.  Well, all my friends get mad because they really want to meet them, and I wander around,  and then I get to meet them, and they hate it because they would ask me questions and  take pictures, and they go, you're the guy who gets to meet them.  That's fun.  But you also have to, like, go to the bathroom. 
[00:07:00]  I do.  I get nervous.  You get nervous stomach.  I do.  You get sour stomach.  I do.  Then I just...  Did you have to run into the bathroom?  I did, yeah.  I just...  I know.  Like, when I met Al Gore, the guy's like, hey, go talk to Roland.  I go, hey, how are you?  I'm like, I'm good.  I go, I got to...  I'll be back in a minute.  Al Gore.  So, wait.  Would you have taken a photo of something?  You have a camera on that?  No.  How did you not get a picture?  Well, these are...  He had to do the...  By the way...  Is he a nervous stomach churning?  I do.  It's a former president. 
[00:07:30]  I get it.  Whatever.  These don't call him Mr. President.  No, you call him Mr. President.  You don't have to say former president.  I said ex-president.  And it's a technicality.  We all know he's a former president.  You don't even have to say former.  I apologize.  You just say President Clinton.  That's right.  Yeah, he's like, hello, Mr. President.  They are still...  You still give them that title.  Or P to the res.  Well, that's a great moment for you, Roland.  Yeah.  It's an awful moment for him, though.  Awful moment for the toilet.  No.  Yeah, I guess I mean...  God.  We also want you to... 
[00:08:00]  Would you leave a grande double espresso?  More than that, Anthony.  Perhaps more than that.  Roland, are you ready to do our tribute to Pavarotti today?  I think so.  Pavarotti.  By the way, Don Wicklund gave me a breaking news email.  Oh, wow.  Only 15 minutes ago that Pavarotti died.  Thanks for listening to the show, Don.  Pretty much started the show off with it.  Ah, he's great.  It is big news.  He must have been busy.  71 years old.  Pancreatic cancer got him, right? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, and we want Roland...  No, can we set up a mic for Roland and some freaking reverb?  Did he?  Reverb.  What happened?  Did he send it to the whole company on the email?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, way to go.  Breaking news.  Which one are we going to use?  The other one is reverb.  All right.  Roland, talk into that.  I want to see if we got some nice reverb for you.  Hello.  Hello.  Say it again.  What?  Hello.  Please. 
[00:09:00]  You got it?  I think so.  All right.  You get your headphones on.  This is Roland.  He's doing his big...  Get this nice boy a coffee on me.  Could you get him a...  That's fantastic.  Get this kid?  Yeah, this kid.  Yeah.  He put his arm around you?  Yeah, because he was talking to people.  Did he smell good?  I was just going to answer that.  He did.  He smelled good, right?  Yeah.  What do you smell like?  Deliciousness?  I don't know.  Oh, my God. 
[00:09:30]  That isn't quite what I was looking for.  Bill Clinton smells like deliciousness.  Deliciousness.  I was thinking, you know, high karate.  You weren't smelling a cinnamon bun, were you, at the time?  One that was right under your nose as you were stuffing your face?  No.  How long did he have his arm around you for?  Just for like a few seconds.  Did he leave a little, like, of his armpit? 
[00:10:00]  Was it on your shoulder?  No.  And then when you went...  Sniffed your shoulder, did you smell Clinton all day?  No.  He just looked like this.  And he went, hmm, pretty good.  Did he look confident in person?  Deliciousness.  He did.  He was just like, people, like, when they had a camera, he goes, do you want to use that  camera?  Use that camera?  Yeah, especially with Hillary running right now.  He's going to be nice to everybody.  Yeah.  Time to get a photo of Clinton.  Absolutely.  He will not say no now.  An eatable she.  All right.  Well, Roland.  Roland screwed it up. 
[00:10:30]  We've got to head to break here, but Roland's got to, like, do Pavarotti proud on his passing.  Yeah.  So you're going to sing what today?  Ave Maria.  Ah, one of the favorites.  One of my favorites, too.  Of Pavarotti.  Right.  Yes, this is a big one.  Yeah, this is a big one for Roland.  He really knows this stuff.  Who knew?  He's a big opera fan, opera singer.  You're going to built this out, right?  Yeah.  Do we have some Pavarotti just to give everybody a little taste of what it's supposed to sound 
[00:11:00]  like?  All right.  The Great Pavarotti.  See that nice, beautiful music.  Wait for it.  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[00:11:30]  That guy's pretty good.  I think this kid's got potential.  I do agree.  This guy can bring his toilet wherever he wants and do a voice like that. 
[00:12:00]  He is that.  Belting out a tune.  Yeah.  All right, I think we've got enough of what it's supposed to sound like.  Roland, you've got to do Pavarotti proud today, okay?  I will.  All right, now do you know where to come in?  Sure.  All right, here we go.  Roland doing Pavarotti.  A little musical.  A little musical. 
[00:12:30]  Maria, gratia per nia.  Maria, gratia per nia. 
[00:13:00]  Ave, ave, Dominus.  Dominus, tecum benita, tecum benita, tecum benita, tecum benititio.  Et tu benititio.  Et tu fracus, tecum benititio.  Finchus tecum benititio.  Jesus.  Ave Maria. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Ave Maria.  Noc et in hora.  Noc et in hora. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Ma-truus.  Et in hora.  Ma-truus.  Ave Maria.  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:30]  Wow.  You think he'll get an 11-minute standing ovation?  Bravo.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Bravo.  El Fatso.  El Fatso.  I am the werewolf.  I like to make werewolf movies. 
[00:15:00]  He sounded like singing.  Hey, wow, what can you say about that?  Well, you know, I'm just glad we can give him a send-off like that.  Yes.  Pavarotti, give him the tribute he so deserved.  In that rendition of one of his classic songs, Ave Maria, as done by our own Roland, I have to take a dump, whatever your last name is.  Let me ask you a question. 
[00:15:30]  I told this to my chick yesterday.  Would you be mad if your girlfriend banned Clinton?  I told her I would almost understand it.  Like, I wouldn't consider it cheating.  Like, if we were in Starbucks and you met him and you went into the bathroom with him.  You're cuckold.  No, but I'm not.  I have no, but I would probably just let her do it.  Go ahead.  Oh.  Why not?  That's those deals that couples make.  The deal, like, that would be her freebie and then you would have to be able to have one.  I love when you're, like, I love when you run into a fat chick and she'll say something like, me and my husband have one. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, we got a deal.  Mine's George Clooney.  Yeah.  You'll let me have sex with George Clooney.  That's great.  You know what I mean?  She's just a slob.  She's a big slob and she's all excited, like, we both have one.  Mine's Brad Pitt.  Yeah, well.  You know.  Who's his?  That chick he works with.  Oh, those dumb deals that married couples do. 
[00:16:30]  Stop it.  Oh, we're faithful to each other, but we both have one, you know.  We're allowed.  Yeah, like Clooney's going to run for that pig.  Bang some freaking house, yeah, soccer mom from freaking Bayshore.  Yeah, okay.  We each have ours, you know.  Mine's, oh.  Well, let me tell you, mine is.  Forget about it.  Right.  Leave for him and a second for him. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, would you?  Is that your freebie?  People are suggesting that Roland's opera becomes a new ringtone.  Not a bad idea.  Cigars and Scotch, what's up?  Photo op diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  He said photo op diarrhea.  I love it.  Well, anyone else want to do a little opera today in honor of Pavarotti?  Now I smell a new bit.  Look at this. 
[00:17:30]  These bits are just flying all over the place today.  Let's say hi to Keith in Connecticut.  I smell some of the Starbucks bathroom, too.  Yeah, Keith.  Yeah.  It sounded like Roland was singing in pig Latin.  Bunch it out.  By the way, Awful Me is saying that Jimmy has one.  You know, one person you're allowed to have sex with.  Yes.  And that would be me.  No.  That's what Awful Me is saying.  That's not.  I think they're going back to the dream where you're a cute birding over the car. 
[00:18:00]  It's sexual, and let's hope Jimmy has one.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  And a lot of people are asking, why didn't Roland try to book Clinton for the show?  Yeah, Roland, you are the official booker of the OPN Ampest.  Yeah, that would have been a good one.  That would have been a nice get right there.  Imagine if he said, I heard those guys.  They're funny.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's heard of the show.  I love that show.  God damn.  He's heard of it.  Those boys are funny.  What?  Great.  What?  He has a book tour?  Yeah, he's only doing television.  When's he doing a signing? 
[00:18:30]  I think this week.  Could he get Jimmy to the signing?  No.  He just flat out said no.  All right, Roland, get out of here.  Can we do the Roland rap?  When you need radio gold, he's the one that you call.  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small.  The one you can count on the book of guests for a session.  But ends every single sentence he says in a question.  No pronunciation, so spoken and numbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic and he crumbles.  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonadeus, Bonadeus, check him out Friday wide.  It's rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'. 
[00:19:00]  It's rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'.  It's rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'.  It's rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'.  That's good.  I mean, head action, suspending.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio,  starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  This is Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  What's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:19:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Look who's in studio.  D.L. Hughley, everyone.  I'm late, but it wasn't my fault.  That's all right.  And don't pay attention to the 80s new wave.  We're kind of goofing on the fact that this is the type of thing other radio shows do.  Yeah, absolutely.  If that makes sense.  Absolutely.  Okay, good.  You've got to have a day of the week thing.  Right.  Freaky Fridays.  That's what they tell you.  Yeah, yeah.  Freaky Fridays.  Yeah, you've got to have things like that.  Or else you're not a successful real radio show. 
[00:20:00]  And the bosses listen, and then they go,  why don't you have, like, days of the week?  Right, right.  So we come up with, like, crap for days of the week.  Because the guys who did the calendar already thought of that.  Yeah.  Just a minute, we're embarrassed that D.L. might just walk in and think that we're just sissies.  Oh, yeah.  We're just doing this to be ironic.  We have to explain everything.  No, thanks for pointing that out.  Because he walked in kind of at the wrong time.  Right.  Because we would have had fun with that song, and Ant would have played his little slide 
[00:20:30]  whistle to it, and we would have goofed on it.  But you walked in, big star, big comedian.  We're like, uh, uh, don't pay attention to that song.  That's definitely what he's doing.  Didn't want to look like a dick.  As soon as you leave, though, tune in the show, and you'll hear us just goofing on it.  And you might even laugh, because some of the people out there do laugh.  Is it okay to laugh anymore?  Can you do it?  No.  That's what we're trying to figure out today there, D.L.  Speaking of which, let's go to Brian in Michigan.  This is really interesting.  Uh, Brian, go ahead. 
[00:21:00]  Hey, uh, we've got our Beaners Coffee Shops here.  Um, pretty popular.  Definitely 10 to 1 compared to Starbucks around here.  And, uh, I was just in there after I've been listening to you guys talk about censorship  in Grand Lodge here, and, uh, they've got to change their name.  Not going to be Beaners Restaurants anymore.  And the funny thing is, there's two ladies in there while I'm there.  They can't even figure out why, until I had to point out what, you know, what angle people  are looking at it from, and, uh, it's just ridiculous that it's coffee shops. 
[00:21:30]  Well, the name they're changing it to is just irritating.  They're changing it to Big B's.  Oh, God.  Big B's Coffee.  What do they, they have to do it, or somebody?  Well, here's the story.  Uh, thank you for sending us up there, Brian.  Uh, are there any actual Mexicans in, um, Michigan?  Yeah, right.  But, uh, boy, did you take, man, you damn near crossed two borders to get there.  Do you really think Mexicans, when you're thinking Beaners Coffee, though? 
[00:22:00]  Who thinks that?  No, I'm saying, but that, that has to be.  Of course that's.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It says many folks in West Michigan can't start their day without the morning cup of coffee.  All right.  One popular Java, uh, joint is changing its name.  Uh, Beaners is changing its name, like Jimmy said, to Big B's Coffee starting January 31st.  Uh, the change comes out of concern that the name Beaners is considered, considered a disparaging term among Hispanics.  Yeah, but any, any Hispanics in Michigan is in the witness protection program. 
[00:22:30]  The only reason they'd be up there, why the hell?  What the hell is there?  Is there a lot of agriculture in there?  Uh, I would think, yeah.  Michigan?  Well, in the rural areas, I would think.  Michigan's a weird spot, because you got, like, Detroit in it.  Right.  But then, on the outskirts, it's like farmland.  Yeah, Ted Nugent's in there shooting his crossbow at people.  You know, threatening the potential president.  Yeah, you got Ted killing his own dinner.  Right, right, right, right.  The hell is going on in Michigan. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  Has Carlos Mencia been to a Michigan?  Is that what the problem is?  Right, right.  Spreading.  Beaners, yes.  I don't understand.  I'm sure no one even complained.  It's another panicky Pete.  Like, we've been saying all morning, you can't do or say anything anymore.  You know, it's so, uh, what was I, uh, you know, because they had a funeral a couple  of months ago for the N-word.  Oh, yeah.  Which messed up 45 minutes of my show.  It's people in my family I can't even talk to now.  How come you don't call?  I don't know what to say to you.  I know. 
[00:23:30]  I was in mourning to it.  Ruined my whole commute home.  Right.  But, you know, it's so funny because more black people die from, uh, eating fried foods  and not exercising than ever heard the N-word.  Yeah.  Like, you don't go to the doctor and you say your cholesterol's coming down, but have you  been saying the N-word?  Yeah.  Your blood cells are starting to sickle.  What are you talking about?  That's exactly what we were talking about.  Like, why not take up some real important issues?  Because that isn't...  It's too hard.  You know, it's too, like, no matter what anybody says, the, uh, it, it isn't the violence or 
[00:24:00]  bad schools or, or, or drugs or, you know, the, the biggest problem in our communities is  that 70% of children are born out of wet.  Like, too many single mothers are raising kids.  That's the deal.  But that ain't gonna get you on the news.  And I, it hurts me when I see a single, a beautiful black woman struggling to raise a child  because if she didn't have that baby, I'd be trying to get some.  You know what I'm saying?  Only time a man comes by when he's there to read the meter.  Are you my daddy?  No, I'm here to cut your gas off. 
[00:24:30]  Well, why are you here?  Will you teach me how to ride a bike?  I don't know.  You got a picture in your mind?  She devil joining.  Can't she keep a secret?  I just think that everything, the things that we tried to fix it, like, like now that,  like, I remember they had a protest in front of FYE music stores and kids don't even go  to music stores.  They'd steal it off the internet like everybody else.  Right.  Who goes to the music?  In two years, those, that, that, that, that, that business won't even exist.  Well, yeah.  They shut down the Tower Records, man.  Right. 
[00:25:00]  It's being phased down.  No one's going to have gone.  Because it's antiquated.  Nobody does.  Like now, like, even Master P, he, he's going to start a rap label with no profanity.  They already have that.  It's called jazz.  You know, we need it.  And, you know, it's, it's so hypocritical because you can't, you can't go to Walmart and buy  a record with graphic content or violent content, but you can't go to Walmart and buy a gun.  Yeah.  You can't get the new 50 cent.  Yeah.  That's the, yeah, that's the big argument right there.  So we can ban songs about guns.  You just can't have a, you know.  Yeah.  It's all this, uh, I said it for years. 
[00:25:30]  It's the symbolism is more important than the substance of something.  So if you make this symbolic gesture that you're trying to curtail violence through getting  the lyrics of rap songs and comedians, uh, cleaned up, but the actual violence is fine.  Right.  Just let that alone because that's too big a problem to really deal with.  Real cute because it's almost like they blame comedians and rappers for the coarseness of  America.  Like, like it wouldn't have been slavery if it wasn't for, you know, pick me, Mark.  I'm starting it. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, like we, like, it's just almost like if you see the world, I think that, you know,  all you have a responsibility to talk about the things you see and if people don't like  the pictures, change the things we see as opposed to talking about the way that we discuss it.  Yeah, people are always very confused as to whether the media is causing the problem or  just a reflection of it.  But yeah, we, before television or radio, there were people, you know, thrusting swords through  each other's abdomens, you know, it's just the way it was. 
[00:26:30]  We're very, we're very, very, very violent nation.  Very violent.  Violent nation.  I think we're a violent planet.  Right, right.  I think.  Well, no, no, we got, I'm telling you, there are more, there are more children between 12 and  17 in prison in Southern California than any other country in the world.  Wow.  Any other country in the world.  I'm not, I'm not a country in the world.  So, you know, we, we, we put people, we're violent.  It sounds like a good stat until you realize they probably kill them in the other countries  and not put them in prison.  Well, you know, they're, they're just buried somewhere in a forest. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 12-year-olds with no hands.  They're taking credit.  Yeah, for spitting out of sight.  I guess that does it.  And, and everything's entertainment, like OJ, man.  And let me.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the OJ thing.  We can all entertain.  We've been waiting for this.  If you get away with murder.  Yeah.  Don't, don't mess up no more.  That's pretty much it.  Don't you go, hey, you know what.  I hear you, bro.  I hear you now.  I'm not, I'm not.  Stay squeaky clean.  Right.  Because they're watching you closely now. 
[00:27:30]  And he's been such a good guy for a few years, you know.  Like, he just goes, he smiles.  Everyone is still getting his autograph.  It's like, if you want to hear the horrible thing, though.  There's the, one of the guys that he's arrested with is a guy I used to play golf with all  the time.  And every time he was playing golf, he would get OJ on the phone with me.  So now, you know, he's like, do you want to talk to OJ?  I'm like, nah.  No, I really don't.  I got, I got enough problems.  I'm going to need to hang out with OJ.  So now, you know, that's the biggest news. 
[00:28:00]  And you know he's going to jail.  You know he is.  Why are people, y'all going to get him back for that?  Oh, you're kidding me.  It's one of those deals where everyone was just waiting for him to trip up.  Oh, man.  And this is really, whatever happened in there, it's really one of those things that  if it was anyone else, you'd just plea bargain it down.  Like, I will get a basic assault, nothing thing.  You get on a little probation or a slap on the wrist. 
[00:28:30]  This is going to be.  He's getting a death penalty.  The penalty, right, for killing two people is going to be put on him now.  Right.  And let me tell you, and then they say, well, he's a, you know, they want to let him go because  he has no ties to the community.  He's a flight risk.  And then he's not a flight risk, but do you remember that slow speed?  Yeah.  And it's like, how are you trying to get away from the police and save gas?  That's right.  Make a commitment.  I want to be free, but gas is $4 a gallon.  Jesus.  Cowling is looking at a phone somewhere just hoping it's going to ring. 
[00:29:00]  Where's Al been?  Where's Al Cowling's been?  Oh, man.  Trying to avoid it.  And Johnny Cochran was a good friend of mine.  We did a bunch of stuff together.  Like, we used to do AT&T commercials.  And he's not, I mean, he got vilified for just doing the job that he was supposed to do.  He's a great attorney.  I mean, I'm telling you what, you might have said a lot of stuff about him, but when you  got in trouble, he's the man you was going to call.  Well, I think if you're a black guy, that's who you want to call. 
[00:29:30]  I don't think because he was a pro.  No, he played the race card with the Mark Furman thing.  I think he turned that jury around.  It ain't really hard to, like Mark Furman is.  Well, yeah, but if you, believe me, talk to any, and I've said this before, talk to any  white guy.  They've used the word.  No, I don't care.  Don't lie to me.  That's what I hate.  It's like.  You show me a white person and they say the N-word and I'll show you a two-year-old.  I'm sorry.  We've got to conclude, Mr. Sibi. 
[00:30:00]  That's the first word they say.  And you almost forgot, a poorly raised two-year-old.  Right, right, right, right.  He's speaking early.  People are lying.  And it's just a plain fact.  It doesn't even, you don't even have to be racist to use it.  No.  It's just the fact that when someone pisses you off in life, you want to throw out the  worst possible thing you can to that person.  So if you're driving down the street and I get cut off and I'm almost driven into a  wall and I catch up and look over, if it's an Asian person, I'm going to throw the worst 
[00:30:30]  Asian slur out.  Not yell it out, but it's going to go through my head.  Right.  I'm going to think, and I'll probably say it in my car with the windows rolled out.  Let me point something out.  I think Jimmy saw it too.  You're exaggerating your story.  How?  You say these words if someone just merges a little too quickly.  Right.  All right.  Someone didn't use a blinker.  Right.  Or you're kidding me off.  How come I couldn't have an extra bag of soy sauce?  And he almost runs me off a cliff.  So now DL, you understand that I had him.  You understand that I had him.  Right.  The guy's shooting at me.  Right.  I was, I was. 
[00:31:00]  Are you kidding me?  It is so, like, like, and I'm not, you know, look, I just, I was here last time I was  here.  Right.  There were the two, there were the three brothers that had shot the police officers.  Right.  Remember that?  And they got in the way with it.  And then they found fingerprints on a bucket of chicken.  Remember that?  That's true.  Now, that's N-word stuff.  Like, I, that's the stuff that you, now, I can't make that up.  But to, to, to act like I know brothers and I know people I would consider the N-word.  And there's a difference.  If I'm hanging out at a cool restaurant, that's all right. 
[00:31:30]  Brothers is cool to hang on.  But if a fight break out, it's the N-word I call.  Somebody that got a police record and ain't scared to get hit in the face.  That's what I mean.  Have you, have you stopped, uh, because you're, you're an edgy comic man.  You, you don't ever, uh, uh, uh, kind of try to appease people.  Have you, have you, because Eddie just got in trouble, Eddie Griffin.  Yeah, but Eddie got in trouble.  You know what?  Eddie got in trouble because, why would you book him for that?  Right.  Well, explain, Jimmy.  We got to reset that.  Well, for Eddie Griffin.  Eddie Griffin, I think it was a black entertainment magazine. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  It was a very conservative.  Right.  It's, it's, it's like, you know, the Kiwanis Club for black people.  Right, right, right.  It's like, why would you book a dirty...  There's people that laugh like a...  Yeah, so they book Eddie Griffin.  It was extremely edgy.  Right, yes.  It was the N-word, right?  It was not the N-bomb, but he was dirty anyway.  Right.  They wouldn't have liked...  So they kicked him off the stage.  That's how it's going to go.  But you book him for, you know, to make these placatory, I just, it's, it's just things  I can't, I can't stand when somebody pretends like they're, they're trying to do good,  but they're really only trying to, to, you know, you can fight causes 
[00:32:30]  that get you on TV, but really don't accomplish anything.  And that's, and that's what I see.  We're just exacerbating the problem by acting like it's the coarseness of words, like it's  the music that did it.  You know, I ain't never seen a remix kill nobody.  Like now when you do drive-bys, you're playing a great R&B hook.  That's great.  I mean, I don't...  It's constantly in the news where someone will jump on a cause.  We've, we've talked about the violent video games.  Right.  And, and people love saying that that's the reason for school shootings. 
[00:33:00]  Uh, and then you look at the circumstances beyond the school shooting.  Here is, they call them social misfits.  Uh-huh.  Social misfits means that some girl ain't having sex with some dude.  If you want to stop school shooting, tighten them up.  Hand out more trim.  You know that dude who walks in, some find somebody to give him some.  Right, right.  That's a deal.  That'll make some frustrated people.  You don't ever see a dude having sex shooting up school.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  That Asian kid, the shadow vision too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the quarterback of the high school football team is not shooting up the school.  No, no.  I think DL's on to something.  And you always saw, I mean, going through school, you always saw the kid that was a little  off.  Right.  And you're like, oh boy, this guy.  And he was constantly just berated.  Right.  And that was one of the kids that could have just at any moment snapped and come in and  shot people.  Save a life, hire a hooker.  Yep.  Get him some.  That's it.  Save a life, hire a hooker.  It's really, it's really hard.  We need t-shirts. 
[00:34:00]  That's a good one.  Social misfits are people that don't fit in because nobody's giving them a month.  We need to take a break.  You're hanging for a little bit.  Oh, absolutely.  How was your, did you just fly in from LA?  Yes.  The red eye?  Yes.  And you're this funny?  And ever since of the word, it was a red eye.  I applaud you today, man.  Oh, man.  Every time we've had to take that red eye, I can't even, like, I can't even function.  You're like 20 hours of sleep.  I was wondering what I was going to come into this morning because, you know, every time  I turn around, you guys are suspended or there's some kind of crap going on.  Jim is being death threats.  I don't understand. 
[00:34:30]  But God bless you because a lot of celebrities cancel our show because of our controversy.  So we have a long list of people that will not do our show because of the crap  we've gotten in.  Anthony Michael Hall.  Ben Kingsley.  Ben Kingsley.  Danny DeVito.  Al Roker.  Yeah, Dan DeVito.  He'll get drunk on The View, but it won't come in.  Yeah, but it won't come in here.  So you challenge us.  There you go.  That's just a bunch off the top of our...  A bunch of them won't come in.  Jessica Alba's people won't let her come in.  Just a bunch of them.  Well, if Jessica's not coming, I can't come here. 
[00:35:00]  Her and her and her.  What's the guy?  Dane?  Dane Cook.  They did that movie.  Yeah.  He's actually coming in.  Of course.  His publicist passed on us and then emailed Dane.  I'm like, well, how come you're not coming in?  He goes, oh, no one told him.  I just saw Mr. Brooks on the plane.  How was it?  I just saw Mr. Brooks on the plane.  Hey, man.  You don't want more people.  You want me to be honest.  Hey, look, man.  That's all right.  I did Soul Plane.  I have no right to talk about anybody.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  You've never seen anybody brutalized the way we brutalized Kevin Martin when he came  back to New York for that movie. 
[00:35:30]  But you know, Kevin was young and he didn't really know what to do when it was his first  gig.  I knew how horrible it was.  I sold out.  I did it for hardwood floors and drapes for my wife.  And I knew I was doing it, too.  It was horrible.  I cast my chick with a mask on.  I kept telling everybody I was JJ from Good Time.  I have a question on Soul Plane.  Wait, wait.  How was the plane so big?  It was a very large aircraft.  How did it fly?  That was my main complaint about the movie. 
[00:36:00]  Well, it was the Cadillac of planes.  It was horrible.  All right.  We got to take a break.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Hey, this is Joe Perry.  This is John C.  This is Brian Regan.  This is Charlie Murphy.  This is Lois Griffin.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  This is Larry the Cable Guy.  You're listening to the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Got a quick little segment to play for you guys.  It's Jim Brewer, one of our old pals, talking about riding mopeds on Long Island. 
[00:36:30]  You Long Islanders are going to love this one.  It's on the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Get the hell out of here with that thing now!  Christ!  He's bringing back a memory.  If you live on Long Island, man, every neighborhood had the kid.  Had the kid with the stupid moped or the motor or the minibike.  Yeah, with Debra Rake and he's like... 
[00:37:00]  All day.  Long Island memories, man.  He was the cool guy, too.  He was also the guy that would stop in the middle while you're playing a stickball game.  Yeah.  And he'd get off the bike and he'd go, oh no, it's the moped guy.  Get off this bike. 
[00:37:30]  Give me the bet.  Hear the cigarette dangling from his mouth?  Pitch the ball.  Take a swing.  And he would look horrible swinging.  Pitch a good boy, kick your ass.  This game is for fairies.  Pitch a good boy, kick your ass.  Pitch a good boy, kick your ass.  He would take off.  He'd take off.  He'd always have a dribble of snot in his nose, but he couldn't say nothing because he was  too tough.  Because he'd beat you up.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Another Long Island memory.  Thank you, Jim. 
[00:38:00]  Two brothers in jail.  If you want to drive your dogs to complete a Saturday, go to Razor.  Pitch a good boy, kick a good boy, kick a good boy, kick a good boy, kick a good boy, kick a good boy, kick a good boy.  I can't listen.  Knock it up.

[00:45:30]  in the park  and what happened  the tree was  I said the tree was spooked  the tree got spooked  and ran in front of the horse  yeah  the horse was spooked  or something  yeah  there was a guy  doing a  you know how people  get in the park  and they just start  doing things for money  yeah  some street performer  was playing a drum  and he spooked a horse  and that horse  being spooked  spooked another horse  and it's that horse  that ran off  and ran smack  into a tree  and killed itself 
[00:46:00]  it killed itself  and then what happened  to someone's beamer  or something  I heard like  yeah the other horse  that got spooked  I think ran into a BMW  right  and kind of dented it up  but that horse  and BMW  are doing fine  I'm weird  with like animals  man  like I'm not a  hardcore animal rights  activist by any means  you know  I'll eat my meat  and I'll wear my fur  and leather  and all that crap  but I walk through  the park a lot  by the way  not being an animal rights  activist  you just talked about  every cruel thing  I'm not  I'm no activist 
[00:46:30]  I'll beat one  I'll kill one for fun  you named every single thing  I'll wear leather  fur  I eat meat  I work at a chicken  processing plant  I take baseball bats  to baby seals  if it's in season  I just want to hammer  the point home  that I'm not an animal  rights activist  cut blubber out of whales  use it for my own  home heating  I gargle with veal  I mean I'm no activist  I keep warm with veal fat 
[00:47:00]  well veals don't get fat  now do they  well they get meaty  they get meaty  anyway  but when I  when I see those  horse and carriages  around the park  I feel really  really  really sorry  for those freaking horses  they're miserable  especially in the middle  of the summer  when it's a slow day  they just stand  in the street  as taxi cabs  are missing  shut up  in Australia  the time's different  yeah  do your role  and just be a listener 
[00:47:30]  please  we'll talk a little bit later  I want to go online  with you later  and just tell  Qantas jokes  where's a stingray  when you need one  well that's personal  anyway  I agree with you  I think they're cruel  and I don't like them  and my girlfriend  I'm going to go on one  over the summer  or whatever it was  and I wouldn't go on one  in New York  in Lancaster  we did it with  it's nice air  I hate that  not the city street  and stuff  there's nothing worse  than seeing the poor horse  sitting there  when they don't have a ride  and they're just  they're parked  all up and down  what is that 
[00:48:00]  Central Park South  and they're sitting there  and you ever see  a horse like  sitting with his hip  kind of  like John Wayne  he's got weight  off of one leg  and the weight's  on the back leg  and then he just goes  and shifts his weight  yeah  just kind of  hanging out here  this is just like  it's supposed to be  on the plains  somewhere  with me  having sex 
[00:48:30]  with horses  and oh  don't take that  clip out  please don't isolate  that clip  if they allow it through  are you allowed to say  sex with horses  well with horses  that's what they do  out on the plains  right  anyway  as long as you don't  make fun of the  horse's ethnicity  or age  right  and don't imitate  what a horse sounds like  no  that would be really  bad radio  in this day and age  horse Americans  will be offended  it's stereotyping  the horse  and don't call a horse  the b word  no we'll get into that  as well  and as the horses 
[00:49:00]  are waiting for their  next ride  these cabbies  and the black cars  the black tinted  ass wipes  that drive those cars  are flying by the horses  missing them by  by mere feet  oh yeah  all day long  and the horse is miserable  it doesn't get any air  in this city  they're sitting in traffic  like they're sitting  behind traffic  with just exhaust  pouring into their  big horse nostrils  those nostrils  aren't made to have  exhaust pipes  in front of them  and hard concrete  under their little  stupid horse feet  I mean look  again I'm no horse 
[00:49:30]  activist  believe me  I'll beat one  for glue  in a second  but they're standing  on concrete  with those hooves  which is painful  I can't watch it  I don't like it  so Nick is bringing up  a story that happened  very recently  this horse running  into a tree  and pretty much  killing itself  oops  committing suicide  he doesn't want to  give these dopes  any more carriage rides  through the park  so some guy  can go  will you marry me  you sit there  and then  sometimes on a chilly night

[00:52:00]  around  no  alright listen  we gotta take  a break  Nick give us  a call a little  later this morning  we like you  I think you  I don't like  a lot of facts  about kangaroos  I think you  could be a  regular on this  radio show  it's Opie and  Anthony  hey this is  David Duchovny  you're listening  to the worst  of Opie and  Anthony  I'm sorry to  do this  you picked the  wrong day to  listen to the  Opie and  Anthony show  why  every once in a  while we like  to find a little  something a little  nugget and we 
[00:52:30]  like to get it  stuck in your  head  this is an  actual commercial  from what year  by the way  it's for a game  oh from the  90s that's it  90s  yeah this was a  game  no way  I would say  it was the  80s  I remember  this  you remember  this  oh hell yeah  I don't remember  this one  I remember  this song  I used to  laugh my ass  off  but I remember  like the apartment  I was in when I  was watching it  and that was  kind of the  80s  yeah  yeah  it's like 
[00:53:00]  80s  alright maybe  late 80s  mid 80s  yeah  something like  that  the wise  Wikipedia is  saying released  1992  1992  okay  well we're  going to get  this stuck  in your head  today  Wikipedia is  stupid  and by the  way  audience  participation  make up your  own jokes  after you hear  this  yeah  it's just a  fun commercial  for a game  you'll remember  it  believe me  you'll remember  it  it's very  nostalgic  and it's  fun to  listen to  and I  don't know  why  it was  not this 
[00:53:30]  funny  when it  was on  the  television  yeah  because now  it's just  really funny  Mr. Bucket  that's right  I'm Mr. Bucket  I'm Mr. Bucket  I'm Mr. Bucket  out of my mouth  I will pop  I'm Mr. Bucket  We're all  gonna run  I'm Mr. Bucket  The game's Mr. Bucket  the first to get  their balls into  Mr. Bucket  wins but look  how  because the ball  will pop  out of his  mouth  I'm Mr. Bucket  the balls  will fine  in my servicios  I'm Mr. Bucket  I'm always  what I'm  about  I'm Mr.  We're all 
[00:54:00]  gonna run  I'm Mr.  Bucket  Mr. Bucket  Mr. Bucket  Milton  pack  Mr. Bucket  I like turtles.  Yeah, I know.  You like turtles.  Mr. Bucket's a good egg.  Man, what is that all about?  It just doesn't look like a particularly fun game.  No.  You drop a ball in Mr. Bucket's head, and his mouth is a big circle, and the ball just falls out.  It pops out.  It's a game for three-year-olds.  Have you ever hung around a three-year-old?  Yes.  You can give him a piece of paper.  They'll be amazed for hours.  You know what I think the object was?  What?  You get different colored balls.  You got to put them in Mr. Bucket's mouth. 
[00:54:30]  No, no.  You put them in his head.  In his head.  And then they pop out his mouth, and then you got to run back and put it back in his  head, because if all your balls pop out, then you'll lose.  And to make it a little challenging for the kids, they have a little shovel.  They can do it with a shovel.  But see, they don't explain it like that.  No.  Because then the song wouldn't be as fun.  It's just fun singing, I'm Mr. Bucket.  Balls pop out of my mouth.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket. 
[00:55:00]  Portion balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth.  Everyone will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I like it.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls in, and Mr. Bucket wins.  But look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Ball is what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Everyone wins.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Not everyone wins.  Someone is suggesting that Oscar De La Hoya lost every time.  When he was playing Mr. Bucket. 
[00:55:30]  Mr. Bucket.  The thing with Mr. Bucket is the ball apparently shoots out of the mouth, too.  It's not just falling out.  There's something inside of Mr. Bucket that propels it out.  Yes.  Propels the balls out of his mouth.  And then you've got to pick them up and put them back in his head.  Because the first one to get all their balls in his head without them popping out of his mouth wins.  Because then all of a sudden you've got one ball left.  And you're like, oh, oh, oh.  You put it in his head.  And bam.  The other ball shoots out of his mouth.  And now you've got to run and chase that one.  And you were almost a winner. 
[00:56:00]  And the frustrating thing is the ball cannot go in the mouth because of the way the thing is set up.  No, you've got to put it on the top of his head.  What about Mr. Bucket?  What's that first line in that song?  It annoys me.  Mr. Bucket?  No.  It's like he's confirming he's Mr. Bucket.  Like people are like, are you Mr. Bucket?  Mr. Bucket?  Can you hear the first line in that song?  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  Hold on, hold on.  All for me.  Very good.  The girl at the start of the commercial sounds like she's saying, let's just put it this way.  Instead of saying Bucket, she's saying something that might be a little dirtier. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Let's hear.  She's saying something fun.  Well, little.  It's a stretch.  Maybe she's blowing off the idea of the game.  Yeah.  Being dismissive.  Yeah.  You know what?  I hear it now.  Now they're going to play this five times a second.  Listen.  Everyone's going to hear it.  Listen closely.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  And then you know how kids are. 
[00:57:00]  They can't pronounce stuff properly.  He's like, that's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  And she's looking at him like, so?  Who mentioned you?  I didn't say that.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  What?  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Toss your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth I will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We.  We.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls into Mr. Bucket wins.  But look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls will pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm all what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket. 
[00:57:30]  We.  We.  We.  It's not a we.  It's not a ride.  There's nothing we about it.  Mr. Bucket is a yellow hunk of garbage.  It's funny.  In the commercial, the kids are just, the angle is a floor angle.  You're on the floor.  Yeah, with Mr. Bucket.  So, Mr. Bucket just looks like an entity.  Get out of the way.  Mr. Bucket's coming through.  Look out.  Spitting balls, causing a ruckus.  And it's just the kids are running around having a ball.  Mr. Bucket is not fun.  Wow.  Late breaking news. 
[00:58:00]  Oscar De La Hoya just changed his name to Mr. Bucket.  I like turtles.  Yeah, we know you like turtles.  Stop already.  Oh, the kids are screaming.  Playing Mr. Bucket with shovels.  Wee.  Wee.  Yeah, Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I like the fact that he just continually sounds like Heather Mills' leg coming off. 
[00:58:30]  I'm Mr. Bucket.  A lot of people, let's just put it this way, are wondering about the black balls in the  game.  Let's just put it that way.  Steve from Bayshore seems to be suggesting a game for an E-Rock.  A mayo bucket.  Put your food in my top.  Into his mouth it will pop. 
[00:59:00]  But it never comes out.  Yeah, that's the problem with that game.  Kids are just waiting around for the food to pop out.  And it never does.  It never does.  We grew donuts in his head.  None of them came out, mother.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  Oh, no.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  This will get stuck in everyone's head today.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth it will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls in and Mr. Bucket wins.  But look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth. 
[00:59:30]  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls will pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  A ball is what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Another feature.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Another feature I just noticed that I forgot about is Mr. Bucket has two arms.  Yeah.  And they move over his head as like a ball blocker for the top of his head.  So it makes it harder to get your balls into the top of his head because his hands are moving 
[01:00:00]  back and forth over the top.  Only a few people will get this but screw it.  He moves his hands over his head like Earl does when Earl's trying to think.  Oh, when Earl's thinking.  Mr. Bucket.  Hey, almost sounds like it.  Mr. Bucket.  Okay.  I just did a joke for about 15 people.  But the thoughts never enter my head.  And that's not even a linger longer issue.  Trust me.  That's just way, way inside.  He's always just scratching his head and moving his hand across his scalp. 
[01:00:30]  Well, they know it from Ronifest.  Trying to figure something out.  I'm Mr. D***.  God, we all forgot about Oscar De La Hoya.  See, here's all the news.  This is today's show.  We just decided.  No-no's.  It was a huge start.  Six-pen.  Who?  Exactly.  What?  Oscar De La Hoya was the star of the show at 635, and now it's all about Mr. Bucket.  It's a no-no's.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Portia balls in my top. 
[01:01:00]  I'm Mr. Bucket.  It's coming out of my mouth and we'll pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  That's the weed.  That's the weed.  What are you doing?  That was fun.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls will pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  A ball is what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee!  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee!  I'm Mr. Bucket with fun.  It's a fun.  Okay.  The awful children's noises you hear.  I know.  I know.  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Screaming in the back of Mr. Bucket.  He's a hit.  By the way, running around with amounts to kitty litter scoopers. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  To pick up the balls with.  People in answer feedback, completely amazed that they didn't dump out of that.  Because we're a professional broadcaster.  What?  We're a professional broadcaster.  It's a great commercial.  The great thing would be if someone put an M-80 in Mr. Bucket's skull, and then the  little snot put her hand out for Wee!  Wee!  Mr. Bucket's ball, and an M-80 landed in her little fat baby fists.  Serves your eye, punk.  They don't really explain that the balls go in from the top of his head.  Yeah, the top of his head. 
[01:02:00]  And then the top of his skull is removed.  He has no top of the head, right?  He's a bucket!  But they don't want to explain that, because then the commercial wouldn't be as fun to  listen to.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I look like JFK in Dallas.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The brains come out of my head.  My wife tries to get him off the trunk.  You can find the ball in the grass.  He knows.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Mr. Bucket comes with a Governor Connolly bucket right in front of him.  There's one little picture of this very bad boy. 
[01:02:30]  He's wearing like an awful Danny Torrance sweater, and he's covering.  He's holding like a yellow, it looks like the letter C, like a hollowed out, like a letter  C if it was a shovel.  Yeah.  Like, it's like a little scoop for the ball to throw Mr. Bucket's head.  It's so to pick up the ball.  And he's covering his face.  He's like freaking out at Mr. Bucket.  The glee is too much?  Is it?  Is that or he's afraid of a talking bucket with a mouth and arms.  Like, hey, mother, there's a bucket speaking to me.  You know the thing that you throw up into, you mop with? 
[01:03:00]  It's down to talking to me and encouraging me to throw things in your head.  You know the thing when you come home on Friday night, and you're a little teetery, and you throw up?  It sounds like what father says to you before he punches you.  But I'm young, I don't understand.  That'd be hysterical.  Dad comes home all drunk and throws up in your Mr. Bucket.  Oh, he doesn't know it's a Mr. Bucket, so you pick it up, and it leaks out of the mouth into the rug.  Oh, you turn it on, and it just starts shooting his vomit on the walls and all over his children. 
[01:03:30]  Good old dad needed a bucket to keep his ears cold.  Mr. Bucket?  Oh, I'll just use the Mr. Bucket to keep my Budweiser's cold.  Mr. Bucket.  Mr. Bucket!  Oh, what?  Again?  I'm Mr. Bucket!  I'm Mr. Bucket!  Portion balls in my top!  I'm Mr. Bucket!  Out of my mouth it will pop!  I'm Mr. Bucket!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls is Mr. Bucket wins, but look out!  Because the balls will pop out as well! 
[01:04:00]  I'm Mr. Bucket!  The balls will pop out as well!  I'm Mr. Bucket!  A ball is what I'm about!  I'm Mr. Bucket!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  I win!  Don't grab it!  Hit her with the bucket!  You know, this is very interesting because...  There's a voiceover for that.  You know, there's obviously some kind of double entendre thing that is being suggested there  just to kind of make this song fun for the parents to listen to something.  You think so?  Yeah, come on!  They could explain the game a little differently than that.  How?  Huh?  How?  What do you mean?  What the game is? 
[01:04:30]  They're colorful plastic toy balls.  You don't think parents that heard this commercial back in the day aren't sitting there laughing  going, oh my god.  Mr. Bucket?  It's kind of like the kid movies they make today.  They throw a little of that adult stuff in there.  Like Shrek.  Knowing that it'll go right over the kid's head.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking that today, sure.  Wee!  All right, we got to take a break.  Wee!  No, they wouldn't want anything.  They want nothing that's not right associated with a kid's toy because parents would never buy  it.  No, I'm not saying they think it's just there where it goes over the kid's head so they 
[01:05:00]  can't really complain about it.  Well, I think they just described the game perfectly is what they did.  You're crazy.  This was purposely done in my humble opinion.  Yeah, what about the Ball Buster game commercial from 1975?  What about it?  Do you have that right there?  All right, hit that, Iraq.  The name of the game is Ball Buster.  Why are they playing the Sting music? 
[01:05:30]  It's a family game.  Fun for children.  It's a bit of hardware.  And for adults, it's exciting.  Babe Ruth's last job before he died.  You make strategic offensive and defensive moves.  Then try to bust your opponent's balls.  It's as easy as checkers.  But exactly like pool, you're a ball. 
[01:06:00]  What the hell are they playing?  Ball Buster.  A great new game from Mego.  I don't remember how the game was, but there's balls you have to bust.  There's like pool.  Yeah, something like that.  I don't know.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll get this stuck in people's head today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Our Bud Dwyer made a Mr. Bucket out of himself.  He shot the top of his head.  Mr. Dwyer.  The gun goes into my mouth. 
[01:06:30]  The brains pop out of my head.  Carl from Newport, Rhode Island.  Here I am.  Comes out of the bag.  A Mr. Bucket.  Sorry.  Carl from Newport writes, you guys missed the we're all going to run part.  Like there's some kind of ball-craving psychopath coming after the children.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket. 
[01:07:00]  Out of my mouth I will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls in, and Mr. Bucket wins.  But look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Mr. Bucket.  From Milk and Bradley.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, we've got to be pretty careful about this next segment.  Don't want to piss off Boston too much today, but the Ted Williams thing is getting out of hand. 
[01:07:30]  Well, apparently his family.  And I was a little sad to hear that Ted Williams passed.  Were you?  Yeah, no joke.  A little sad.  Yeah.  Well, any time a legend passes on.  The last few years of his life were pretty tough.  Mm-hmm.  I think it's an example to the parents out there that they should treat their kids much better.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe Ted Williams was a good father, and this guy turned out to be a douche anyway.  Could you see Ted being a good father?  This guy, John Henry, one of his sons, has been living off his father's name for many, many years. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  And there's been a lot of stories that have come out where he's made Ted's son a lot of bats while he's retired in his little home there in Florida or wherever he was just to try to make more and more money.  And now this new idea is just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Well, his son, Ted Williams' son, John Henry, has decided he wants his father to be cryogenically frozen.  You know, where they take you and they freeze you, they suspend you in this liquid that freezes you. 
[01:08:30]  Bring you back to life.  Until years and years pass and they come up with a cure for what killed you.  But, you know, when you're that old, where are they going to go?  Where are they going to come back to?  Yeah, I know.  Well, the problem is they haven't really figured out how to defrost you where you're going to be okay.  They just think it's going to be, you know what it is?  They think it'll be, we're thinking in terms of today.  If you're frozen and they take you out, the technology we have today, you know, they're looking for the Star Trek type technology. 
[01:09:00]  Where like Bones can take that pepper shaker and wave it over you and all of a sudden you're not just cured, but you can get younger or something.  What a scam.  Yeah, it's a total scam.  You want to believe?  You want to believe.  Immortality.  But, you know, there's also the other option that his son is talking about, which is the DNA.  He's saying that if they preserve his head, just his head, that later on they can. 
[01:09:30]  This is real, right?  This is real.  If they preserve his head.  It says AP next to the story, right?  Right, AP.  Okay.  You want to hear a clip?  Listen to this clip.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  And I said, we're not doing anything.  It makes me so sick.  That's the daughter, right?  Right.  The half-daughter or something.  She's at odds with the brother because she wants to have Ted's wishes, which were to be cremated. 
[01:10:00]  He was a very private man.  Just the fact that he's part of this spectacle now is probably rolling in his cryo chamber.  I thought Ted's wishes were that the Red Sox would win a World Series.  Oh, you've got to go there.  Maybe this will be the year now.  They'll rally.  Maybe they'll rally for Ted and Ted can have some influence.  So John Henry wants to preserve the head of his father.  Well, I guess he would like the whole body. 
[01:10:30]  But he'll accept just the head.  Just the head because that's what they do, too.  Get this, these cryo places, they figure if you can't afford the big chamber for the whole body, they sell you on the fact that, look, we'll chop off his head and then we freeze the head.  Because in the future, we'll be able to put that head back on something.  We'll clone his body.  We'll have his brain.  See, that's what they get.  We'll have his brain. 
[01:11:00]  Because cloning, if you clone the body, he'll just be a guy going, oh, I'm Ted Williams?  What?  He won't know.  But now they have Ted's brain.  So when the future comes along and they defrost him, he'll be fine.  Can I hear that clip one more time?  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  It makes me so sick.  Like something of a zombie movie.  We can freeze his head. 
[01:11:30]  And Fat Bastard is going to show up at the clinic and steal his moojo.  He's got more mojo.  Oh.  We have another clip of the daughter?  Yep.  Ted Williams' daughter.  He said that it would be really interesting to sell dad's DNA.  There's a lot of people out there, he said, that would buy dad's DNA.  And there could be lots of little Ted Williams' running around. 
[01:12:00]  This John Henry guy is insane.  First base, Ted Williams.  Second base, Ted Williams.  Third base, Ted Williams.  Catching Ted Williams.  Right field, Ted Williams.  A whole team of Ted Williams.  How great would that be for the Sox?  A whole team of just Ted.  They already have that team.  They're called the Yankees.  First base, Bugs Bunny.  Second base, Bugs Bunny.  F-ing Yankees.  Oh, man.  His head, though.  That's got to be something. 
[01:12:30]  Just freeze the head.  Ted Williams' head, people.  Ted Williams' head.  Now, this is memorabilia at its pinnacle.  All the cards, all the cards I sold over the years ain't nothing compared to sports figure body parts memorabilia.  That's what I'm into now.  And we're starting with Ted Williams' head.  We're going to clone him.  Look, I'm cloning right now in my laboratory. 
[01:13:00]  We're going to clone heads.  Get it on FlexPay.  Like, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000.  Clone him with some stronger arteries.  They tend to just bust open on him.  Come on, people.  We got the babe's larynx again.  Up for bids.  I remember that from a few bits ago.  You know, if this guy John Henry could, he would just travel the country with Ted Williams' head in a jar. 
[01:13:30]  Like a pickled punk.  Without a doubt.  He would do something crazy like that.  You know what?  The Sox should sign up Ted Williams' head.  Could you picture it?  Come on.  They just put it out on home plate.  Try to pitch to that.  Ball.  Ball.  Ball.  Ball.  Well, really can't seem to get a good pitch in on Ted Williams' head. 
[01:14:00]  That's got to be hard.  That one high.  Again, high.  Right up by the eyes, that one.  Playing some chin music.  Just a bit outside.  He tried the corner and missed.  Ted Williams, since coming back to Major League Baseball, has 175 walks.  Ball.  That one again, high.  And he takes another base on a walk.  They'll roll him down there to first base.  Ted Williams' head.  What a season he's had. 
[01:14:30]  Clemens with the pitch.  Oh, no.  He hit him.  He hit him.  Clemens again with the chin music.  That would have gave him a black eye.  But he takes his base.  Look at Ben.  It's disgusted.  Ben is disgusted.  Don't die in Boston, man.  Don't, don't, don't.  God forbid we talk about John Henry wanting to, you know, preserve his father's head.  This isn't coming out of left field.  This is coming from reality.  The guy wants to do this. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Wants to sell his DNA to sports fans.  We got Lou Gehrig's lymph nodes.  Lou Gehrig's lymph nodes.  You'll be the luckiest man on earth if you get this.  Pardon the pun.  Ted Williams' head.  People, look.  Look, I got it on my shoulder right now.  I'm the two-headed guy.  You could do this all day with your own Ted Williams' head.  Be the life of the party with Mickey Mantle's liver. 
[01:15:30]  The big sliver.  Just put it in a punch bowl.  It's self-pasting.  Ben laughs at that.  Ben's laughing at the Mick.  Making fun of a Yankee's okay, but not making fun of a Red Sox.  There you go.  Yeah, I see where you are.  What, enough time went by that we could make Mickey Mantle jokes and it's okay?  You douche.  We got Billy Martin's windshield with his face still on it.  Billy Martin's windshield. 
[01:16:00]  Look at his face out.  It looks like the shrouded Turin.  All right, I'm in.  You got me.  Come on.  We got various Thurman Munson pieces.  Various Munson pieces.  They're pretty tiny.  But we send them there.  You open it up, you don't even know what you're going to get.  Look, I'm opening up my Thurman box.  Oh, you wrote the same joke. 
[01:16:30]  Look, you don't know what you're going to get.  Look, it's a tongue.  I got Thurman's tongue.  Limited edition.  Pick your own pieces.  You order enough, you can build your own Thurman.  All the king's horses, all the king's men couldn't put Thurman together again.  But you can if you order now on FlexPay.  It's all about cloning.  Just clone the pieces.  Clone the pieces.  I got a Ted Williams rookie head card. 
[01:17:00]  First edition.  Jim Mint 10.  Jim Mint 10.  Jim Mint 10.  This guy holds the record for walks.  He's never hit a ball since being re-upped with the socks.  Rookie card Ted Williams head rookie.  What are you going to pay for this?  And you could have the head cloned.  That could be rough.  Very limited edition.  Arthur Ashe's T-cells.  Very limited edition. 
[01:17:30]  Ain't many of these people.  Had a hard time finding any at the end.  We got Lyle Alzado's bloated steroid brain pieces.  His brain damn near popped out his head.  He had to keep that bandana around his head because his steroid brain was popping out.  Bobby will eat his finger.  Bobby will eat his finger.  Bobby will eat his finger.  And, of course, we got John Crook's cancer nut. 
[01:18:00]  Cloned anyone could have.  I play ping pong with him with my kids.  Hey, Bob from D.C. once in.  Yes, Bob?  Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know about the marketing campaign that Boston Red Sox are doing.  It'd be Ted Williams' bobblehead night.  It's real head.  There ain't no spring, so it just falls off.  Dave Trevecki's arm.  Come on, we got it.  Ted Williams' head's on third. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, boy, Philly.  I think the city's going to start fighting again.  Kobe, what's up?  Ted don't lead much when he's on first.  Hey, perfect for the Sox.  You put Ted Williams' head at first base, the ball never goes through his legs.  How about Bill Buckner, you Sox suckers?  Oh, boy, the city's going to start fighting.  Hey, Joe, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Lance Armstrong's left nut.  Get it on Flixby.  I'll see you guys.  You suck.  Hey, do you have Johnny Moses' legs, Anthony? 
[01:19:00]  We got Will Chamberlain schlock.  Will Chamberlain schlock.  This thing isn't in Jim Intent condition.  Been used a lot.  Hey, Keith wants to make a bid.  Yes, Keith?  Yeah, I want to place a bid on Thurman Munson's altimeter.  Thurman Munson's altimeter.  That comes with a lung.  Look at this coming up for bid now.  Vernon Maxwell's daughter.  Up for bid now.  Let's clone her.  Cut her head off. 
[01:19:30]  We got Payne Stewart's frostbitten toes.  That was a cold flight.  Cold flight to nowhere.  Kind of twilight zone.  Shut up, you idiot.  No, stop.  Come on.  He was traded like, that makes it all good.  Yeah, yeah.  That was very tragic for the Canby family.  That's all I'm saying.  Carson.  Walter.  Jim Abbott's fleshy baby hand.  Maybe the Mets can clone Mo Vaughn when he was good. 
[01:20:00]  We're going to send you Dale Earnhardt.  You want him?  He's yours on Flex Pay.  And the whole thing comes in something the size of a paint can.  You can smell Tiger Woods' fingers.  How about that one?  No one's got to die for that.  Jason, what's going on?  What's happening, guys?  How are you doing today?  Good. 
[01:20:30]  I just wanted to place a bid for you with you, Don.  I was wondering how much I could get the ball that killed Tony Kinniglio.  The ball that hit him on the head.  And the Red Sox do suck.  Later, guys.  Oh, boy.  This could be rough.  Yes, Joe.  I want to put in a bid for the Gale Saints, Brian Piccolo, backfield.  Yes, Frank.  Yo, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to place a bid on the stuffed Corey Stringer.  You missed the joke.  The life-size doll. 
[01:21:00]  That's what makes it funny.  I'm sorry.  That's Corey's...  All right.  Now we're getting a little rough.  Nathaniel.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Nathaniel.  I'm wondering if you have any of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team left.  All right.  Stop.  Oh, God.  Paul.  Walt from the city.  Can I bid on Bob Murphy's memory?  It's okay.  I'm not using it.  That was a towering high fly ball deep to center field. 
[01:21:30]  Easily caught to end the inning.  With the score tied at nine apiece, we pause for these words from...  What?  I'm still in my garage?  Oh, I thought I was watching the game and announcing...  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  As Ted Williams rolls to second base, we pause for these words from Budweiser, the king  of beers.  Go ahead, Mikey.  I've got a bid for Donnie Moore's brain matter.  Oh.  And it comes with the second place trophy. 
[01:22:00]  We got George Brant's hemorrhoids that he was so proud of.  Look what I got up on my mantle here.  It's Joe Torrey's prostate.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to ask Don West if I could put a bid in on Walter Payton's liver.  Walter Payton's liver.  That thing was ravaged.  Or at the very least, I get Mike Utley's spine.  All right.  Hey, hey.  I want Len Bias' nostrils.  How would you like that Michael Jordan's pop propped up in your own room? 
[01:22:30]  Use his head as a whistle.  It can happen now through cloning.  Hey, all the big sports card memorabilia places are selling the clone sports figures.  Tony.  Yeah, I'm looking to buy a Dale Arnott skull puzzle.  That's a tough one.  But look, I'm trying to fit the pieces together.  There's a thousand of them.  This is worse than the 3D White House I tried to put together. 
[01:23:00]  It's impossible.  And for Jordan's dad, you could use him in your car to get in the HOV lane.  It's going to pay for itself, people.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This one's in mint condition.  It's even still sealed.  It's Roberto Clemente's parachute.  All right.  Argentinian soccer team beef patties.  This stuff isn't that far-fetched if John Henry wants to sell DNA of Tony Williams.  Yes, Paul.  Yes, how much for a Martina Navratilova's ****? 
[01:23:30]  Later, douches.  I know.  You know what?  I know they dumped out of that, unfortunately.  He wanted to know how much Navratilova.  Navratilova.  Thank you.  Her junk.  Her junk.  Her mule.  Why is someone saying, and cut?  And scene.  Hey, man.  He's walking these days, Brian.  Brian.  Yo. 
[01:24:00]  Hey, what's up?  I want to know if I can get some of Dennis Baird's running shoes.  Change the joke.  Stop it.  Change the joke on us.  Who wants a flu, Joey Orta?  We got it here.  I cloned it.  All right.  Now we've gone too far.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I just want to put a bit on, it's not sports related, but Rich Voss is funny bummed  because he ain't using it.  Yeah.  Just when he thought it couldn't get worse.  Matt.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Matt.  I got the Kyle family shattered hopes and dreams. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, okay.  Just punch it out.  I can't.  How do we always start with Ted Williams' head and end up in this quagmire?  Pam Anderson doesn't play sports.  Yeah.  Stay with the program.  Stay between the lines, guys.  Let me see.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:25:00]  That will really piss off, Buffalo, and we're going there Saturday.  That is horrible.  You are the worst.  That.  That will get a Buffalo.  Let's save that for after we get back from Buffalo.  How's that?  He wouldn't need a Duns cap.  All righty.  Well, I guess that's it.  Why don't we go to break with some classic Bob Murphy.  The pitch.  High fly ball. 
[01:25:30]  It leads to left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Agbayani can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I was sure he was unable to reach it.  It's caught by Agbayani.  I apologize.  He was way out there, and it didn't look like he had a play on it,  but he caught it against the wall in left center field.  Okay, here we go.  Hey, this is Bret Michaels of Poison,  and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:26:00]  Let's go to Jason.  A lot of our listeners hung up.  They couldn't wait for the break.  Jason and Randolph, what's up?  Hey, I was just calling about this whole case thing.  I don't think it's a fact that the cops have a new toy to play with.  It's a fact that I'm pushing their chest around and being in charge of something.  I think that these guys were beat up in the school, you know,  in the sandbox at school when they were growing up.  The parents took advantage of them, and now they've got a little bit of a  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Sorry about that.  They've got a little bit of power.  If they want to puff their chest, I'll prove that they're in charge.  Some guys, yeah.  It's about, I'm in charge. 
[01:26:30]  It's my house, my rules.  You're going to listen to me, and I get a taste.  This is going to help me prove that point a little bit more extremely.  They did a psych...  Power crops.  Sorry, sir.  Absolute power crops, absolutely.  All right.  We get it.  We know.  But they don't have absolute power, and they are on some level accountable,  and some of them are corruptible, and some of them aren't.  But they did, like, a great psychological profile of cops,  and they said that them and criminals have a very similar personality maker,  but both went in the...  I guess to do something that extreme, like, professionally or a lot,  you have to have a certain personality type. 
[01:27:00]  I don't like the fact that they just threw out absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Oh, I know.  I don't like that.  So does the buck stop here?  So get a hold of yourself.  Why don't you speak softly and carry a big stick?  Well, go grab a bird in your hand.  It's worth two in your bush.  Six or half dozen the other.  Six.  Six or half dozen.  Hold on one second.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on one second.  Wow.  Mark's first words are just not disappointing anyone.  Absolute stupidity appears absolutely stupid. 
[01:27:30]  What did you say?  Six or one half dozen the other.  Six or one half dozen the other.  Is your father Yogi Berra?  Why?  Six or one half dozen.  Because you just take expressions that are very cliche and, like, you remove parts of them and then just combine them.  Save time.  Six or one half dozen of the other.  You've never heard that saying?  I've heard...  Oh, my God, Ray.  I've heard six of one half dozen of the other. 
[01:28:00]  Six to one, a half dozen of the other.  Yeah.  Six to one.  Not six or half dozen of the other.  Six to one?  Yeah.  It's six to one half dozen of the other.  I've heard six of one.  If you think about it...  Six of one, a half dozen of the other.  I've heard it of.  No.  Because you've got six of one...  Half dozen of the other.  ...and then a half dozen of the other would be...  What the saying is, it's the same thing.  It's six or six.  I've heard it play like it was odd.  Six to one, half dozen of the other.  Like, that's the way...  Like, odds?  Six to one?  Six to one. 
[01:28:30]  Six to one odds, half dozen of the other.  That's what I heard my God say.  I've never heard that.  Here's the thing.  Six or one, half dozen of the other.  Wow.  Two things.  In the real world, nobody questions that.  But here's the thing.  You know what I learned yesterday?  Do you know what...  Do you know what...  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth means?  Do you know what...  Yes.  If you hand me a present to close my eyes.  No.  Do you know that?  Do you know what...  Don't look a gift horse...  Yes, I do.  Because a lot of times...  I'll tell you.  Okay.  Horses were typically used to bring gifts to the American Indians... 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  ...because of the anthrax and...  I'm sorry.  What do they have?  Wait, wait.  The anthrax back then.  Because I meant to say smallpox.  Yeah, that sounds like...  Smallpox, they would not interact with the Indians, so the horses would actually bring gifts on their backs, on a saddle,  because they didn't want to interact with somebody with smallpox.  Wrong.  Wrong again.  I made it up.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth means...  You tell the age of a horse from its teeth.  So you open up its mouth and you look, and if it's a gift horse, don't be... 
[01:29:30]  You know, it's a gift.  You shouldn't be saying this isn't good enough.  So you look at the teeth and see how old the horse is.  First of all, I just thought that you are very smart and you know everything, but it just hit me that somebody probably just sent that to you on the computer.  No, no.  I used to own horses.  God, do you listen to the show at all?  Well, Anthony used to be a cowboy.  I was a cowboy.  Pretty much a cowboy for a few years there.  In my youth.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I used to rope and ride and shoot. 
[01:30:00]  While you were dressing sexy for drug dealers to get a little more drug.  I was racing Jim Canna.  Yeah.  Jim Canna barrel racing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do listen, but I must have missed that day.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  I missed a horse day.  Yeah, that is an interesting expression.  It's a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd like to get a gift horse and then just knock his teeth out.  I wish I could punch hard enough and knock a horse's teeth out.  Hey.  How stupid it would feel.  Don't punch a gift horse in the mouth. 
[01:30:30]  The listeners don't even miss a beat ever.  They're now using the Rich Voss method.  You got Coke Logic writing, great minds think a lot.  Oh, right.  I heard that one yesterday.  Never forget.  On the replay.  Right.  It's hysterical.  I'm driving home listening.  Great minds think a lot.  Let's go to Jeff in Chicago and we pound you for that one.  No kidding.  Jeff.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I want to tell you you're a genius.  Why?  The little turtle line.  Yeah.  I love it. 
[01:31:00]  I was busting up yesterday and the reason why was that every time you played that turtle  thing, you'd follow it up by saying, I know, I know.  It just had me going.  All right.  Cool.  I like turtles.  Thanks.  I know.  People still enjoying the I like turtles.  It's turtles.  All right.  Oh, here we go.  Let's say hi to Scott in New York.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, bud.  Hey.  It is Scott.  Don't put all your glass houses in one basket. 
[01:31:30]  Don't tell you what?  All your glass houses in one basket.  They're just using the Ridge Voss formula today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I want to get another play out of this.  The Mr. Bucket thing we were playing yesterday.  Mr. Bucket.  Mick Jagger gathers no moss.  Mr. Bucket.  We were doing this whole thing yesterday and we got some positive feedback on the beat  version of the commercial. 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  I want to play that again.  But first, let's play the original.  This is an actual game for kids there, Rich Voss, from the early 90s.  I don't remember this commercial.  Oh, I do.  My girl said, you don't remember this commercial?  I'm like, no.  Mr. Bucket.  You really remember this?  Yeah, definitely.  I do not.  Watch a lot of TV.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth and will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The game's Mr. Bucket. 
[01:32:30]  The first to get their balls in and Mr. Bucket wins.  But look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls will pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  My balls what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Mr. Bucket.  Mr. Bucket.  From Milton Bradley.  Doesn't the guy who's doing the Mr. Bucket announcement, the Mr. Bucket, the balls in my mouth,  doesn't he look like he's like on a coke binge and his teeth are grinding?  Grinding his teeth.  Mr. Bucket.  The goal is like he just can't get it out faster.  All right.  We took that commercial and we put a few beeps in it. 
[01:33:00]  We like to play the beep game every once in a while.  Me.  And it sounds a little differently.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls in my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth and will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Me.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls in and Mr. Bucket wins.  But look out.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls will pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Me.  We're all going to be.  I'm Mr. Bucket. 
[01:33:30]  We're all going to beep.  Mr. Bucket.  I like that beeped one.  Yeah.  I really hate the way it starts off like with a noise and then like the lead, the way the  boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  Mr. Bucket.  What a creep Mr. Bucket is.  Just a talking bucket walking around the house bothering your kids.  Shooting balls out of his mouth.  Mr. Bucket sucks and he's a health hazard.  A talking bucket.  Yuck.  How horrible is that gig for the studio band that has to come in and play the background 
[01:34:00]  for that?  I'm Mr.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  I'm a bass player.  A bass, yeah.  You want to be Geddy Lee and the next thing you're going to be strumming for Mr. Bucket.  For the Mr. Bucket theme song.  They dubbed children's voices over here yelling we and we.  I might recognize this music when your uncle walked into the room.  You know, the background music to Mr. Bucket.  You know, I got greedy.  I was.  Yeah.  You had a great point.  And then I got greedy.  Well, let's go to Bob in Wisconsin.  Bob, what's up? 
[01:34:30]  Hey, I got a question for boss.  Yeah.  Hey, boss, do you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome?  Irritable bowel, did you say?  Yeah.  Oh.  Let me reach him in that one, though.  Oh.  Sorry, Bob.  Let's go to Joe on Long Island.  Joe, what's up?  Play on words.  Yeah.  Yeah, I used to have Mr. Bucket and the balls used to get stuck in his mouth every morning.  Really?  It looks like there would be a problem with the mechanism.  Yeah.  Because if you drop it in the top, it looks like it drops it in the top of his skull and  the balls get fired out of the mouth. 
[01:35:00]  But it looks like the balls would get stuck coming out of the mouth if the mechanism wasn't  functioning properly.  Yeah.  Did the bucket call Kenny to help him?  What?  Oh, that was a great one.  No one knows what you mean.  I'm trying to figure out.  What?  Maybe you're getting too deep.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You've got to just loosen up and...  Yeah, what happened?  Don't try to...  Don't swing for the fences.  No, he was pretty excited.  He moved forward and everything, and he grabbed onto the console.  He thought he had a good one.  Here's what boss does with his stupid ring.  He taps it because he's a nervous Nelly. 
[01:35:30]  Just in life, done on the air.  He'll go, punchline.  He could always skate like a little...  His ring hits the console.  We just took you inside the show.  Now you'll hear that tap all morning long.  You're right.  You're 100% right there.  I try to hit a home run instead of building.  Yeah.  I try to...  Instead of...  Yes.  It's the first inning.  I should just take it easy.  Yeah.  And look, because sometimes the strike is...  The ball is...  It's a strike.  You just got to sit there and look at it. 
[01:36:00]  You don't have to swing at everything.  Thank you.  Or hit a pitch to the opposite field once in a while.  How about that?  How about taking a pitch to the low right corner and...  How about over the first baseman's head into right field for a nice little single?  A little blooper.  Or sometimes you have to bunt and sacrifice for the other guy.  Well, you do that a lot.  You certainly do.  But use the bat and stop using your chin and face to allow the ball to hit and just  fall stupidly off of it.  Man, it's...  I love balls.  You know, everyone's talking about the tasers now.  Taser's under fire. 
[01:36:30]  Don't take the tasing videos away from us, man.  That's right.  They're doing a whole story on Good Morning America about the tasers.  That's what I wanted to use on stage.  Remember I told you?  Yeah.  Tase the audience.  Yeah.  That'll help.  All right.  Hey, wake them up.  Hey, why don't we bust a nut with corn nuts?  It's not about anything else.  Go to your room and lock the door.  Cause when you try it once, you'll want to try it some more.  Size doesn't matter and that's a fact.  It might be small, but it's a big effect. 
[01:37:00]  Bust a nut.  Bust a nut.  Grab a bag of corn nuts and bust a nut.  Delightly toasted and hard as well.  Enjoy yourself.  We won't tell.  Corn nuts, an intensely crunchy corn snack, comes in seven nut-busting flavors. 
[01:37:30]  Bust a nut at a convenience store in New York.  Yeah.  I hated those things.  They barely...  Terrible.  Oh, did I hate those things.  It tastes like rotted teeth.  They barely talk about the corn nuts in the commercial, but, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Gives them an excuse to do the slug line over and over again.  That's gotta be kinda new cause corn nuts aren't that old.  I mean... 
[01:38:00]  Corn nuts are ancient.  Are you kidding me?  All the flavors, seven flavors?  1975.  What are you talking about?  What?  No, cause flavors just came out recently, like, when they came out with, like, the salt  and bitter.  The salt and bitter.  Please, God.  Stop his heart.  I can't.  What?  Flavors just came out?  No.  Like how they assorted flavors on different things?  See, you think it's crazy?  But, like...  I've never hated anybody as much as I've ever hated. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  You're in rare form today, man.  Like, take, for instance, potato chips.  Okay.  All right.  Back in the day when kids had barbecued and regular, okay?  But all of a sudden, in the last maybe five years, six years, they came out with all these  new flavors, the salt and vinegar, the pickle.  Sour cream and onions.  Wait, wait, wait.  See, that is recently.  That's not like...  Salt and vinegar chips are, within the last five years?  Five, six years.  I wouldn't say...  They had them in the Old West.  Holy...  Are you kidding me?  Do you really... 
[01:39:00]  You really don't think that flavors...  I mean, flavors have been around forever, but...  You relapse?  What?  You relapse, man.  Did you relapse?  Can you...  Can you do me a favor, Hawk?  Can you Google...  Being a father at 50 years old is killing you, man.  A newborn father.  Father of a newborn.  Okay.  Can you...  Can you...  Can you Google something about this?  When did...  Somehow find when flavor started? 
[01:39:30]  I get...  I'm going to bet this.  I don't know what year it was.  What?  Can I tell you...  But it wasn't 02.  Can I tell you when flavor started?  Yeah, flavor.  When...  Was it Adam?  Yeah.  Spit into the apple?  Yeah.  There you go.  That's when flavor started.  He went, wow, this tastes good.  I missed a boss.  Dumb crap comes out of my mouth.  Hey, a couple things here.  Let's go to Jim in Pennsylvania.  Jim, what's up?  Yeah, I'd like to kill two bosses with one stone. 
[01:40:00]  Jesus, boss.  My ears went from the...  Flavors.  Flavors.  Flavors are relatively new.  Five years ago, they started, according to...  Yeah.  Five years...  Five years ago, flavor started.  Six years ago, you went into Baskin Robbins.  They went, vanilla.  Yes.  That's all we have.  We're not even...  Here's some frozen milk with sugar dumped on it.  Yeah, we don't have even one flavor.  We're licking ice cubes only six years ago.  Home of zero flavors.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  31 in five years, not bad.  We're cranking now.  Five years ago, there was no flavor.  Alex from New York City.  Wow, what a revelation.  Flavors have been around forever.  They had Orange Tang in the 60s, where they sent up the moon people.  Yeah, the moon people.  Yeah.  Moon people.  Astronauts.  It's catching.  Let's go to Ed.  Ed, what's up?  Wear a SARS mask around Voss, where you just start sounding stupid. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, Rich.  SARS.  Spelled C-Z-A-R.  SARS mask.  God, I'm sorry.  We're all over the place.  I'm sorry.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, Rich.  I got a question for you.  Is the Earth round or flat?  Oh, please.  And how's my kid doing?  Good.  Good.  That's all you got?  How's my kid doing?  Happy bit.  Did you sleep last night?  No.  Not at all. 
[01:41:30]  40 minutes I slept.  Why?  What's going on?  Baby's up crying.  I'm yelling.  I'm yelling, and Bonnie goes, you're not mad at me.  I go, partially your fault.  Why are you mad at her?  Because your baby's crying.  She carried the thing for nine months.  Give her a break.  We have an extra room that she can take the baby into and sleep and do whatever.  So she doesn't keep the baby in your room?  The baby's sleeping right between us.  Oh, my God.  It's over.  Wait.  What do you mean in between you?  You're going to roll over on it.  Yeah.  In between.  Like, she's on one side, I'm on the other. 
[01:42:00]  Is that normal at that age?  No.  What?  For the...  Put it in a crib somewhere.  My older daughter still sleeps in between us, but she won't get into the crib or the  bassinet without crying.  You got to train her.  I mean, I don't even have kids.  Dude, you got to...  Seriously.  You got to...  Yeah, we give her a biscuit every time she does it.  Well, but I mean, you got to just say, hey, straighten up, kid.  March five.  And then you let them cry and cry and cry, and you got to take the pain until it falls  asleep in that stupid bassinet.  A bassinet. 
[01:42:30]  I'm sorry.  Damn it.  Sorry.  I didn't like the fact you would let me touch your baby.  I wasn't going to be poking at it.  You didn't want to.  When I first saw your baby.  Well, because...  Is that normal?  No.  In the beginning, before six weeks, you have to wash and disinfect your...  Especially your hands.  That, you know...  Because the baby's, you know...  So you're mad at Bonnie because...  No, I'm not mad at her at all.  I'm just...  Because the baby kept you awake.  I haven't...  And she should know better to get the baby out of the room and go to the special feeding  room.  Flop one out and let the kid partake.  And it's so weird watching... 
[01:43:00]  Like, because my first kid, my ex-wife didn't breastfeed.  And watching her breastfeed, she just lays there.  She has a technique where she'll lay down.  Like, not hold the baby too.  Like, she's almost like leaning on her arm.  Let the kid do all the work.  Yeah.  And just drops her breast in the baby's face.  Oh, that's good.  And, you know, she's watching TV as...  You know, and it's kind of like weird in between that.  It's kind of uncomfortable.  You know what I'm saying?  Are you jealous of the baby yet?  Well, the fact his hands are bigger on her breast. 
[01:43:30]  Are you jealous of it?  No, not at all.  She's a very...  I didn't sleep.  You know, but even if I had eight hours sleep, I would still say that potato chips just came  out with all these new flavors about six, seven years.  All the new ones.  Fan said 1950s.  Flavors have been around.  Relative to Voss, that is recent.  Wait, potato chip flavors?  I'm a fan.  Yeah, potato chip flavors.  Oh, yeah, barbecue.  But what...  Salt and vinegar.  Salt and vinegar.  The one you used... 
[01:44:00]  The one you used, yes.  I remember eating salt and vinegar as a kid.  No way.  Now that I'm in my early thirties.  That's a long time ago.  Yeah.  Salt and vinegar kind of made a resurgence.  But it had been around for quite some time.  Yeah.  Where'd you hear...  You heard that recently.  Where'd you hear that?  What?  The flavors were new.  Someone said that.  You weren't...  Yeah, it sounds right.  No, no, no.  Well, because Bonnie said that a lot of the flavored chips came from Canada, like the dill pickle  and the...  Oh, is she a Canadian that tries to push that whole Canada invented everything? 
[01:44:30]  A couple things.  A couple things.  Dill pickle chips.  Thanks, Canada.  Good.  All right.  Let's say hi.  Thanks.  We give them light and electricity, and they give us dill pickle chips.  Suckers.  Now they're all bragging that their money is the same as ours.  That is annoying.  Oh, does that bug me?  First time in 31 years, the dollars are the same.  Yeah, the dollar and the loony.  What's happening to the U.S. dollar?  I don't understand the economy at all.  The U.S. dollar is just plummeting.  Why?  We suck.  Eh, because we do suck.  We got too much cheap money out there. 
[01:45:00]  That's what it is.  How do we get rid of this?  Too much cheap money.  We got to start burning our money.  Just start burning boatloads of cash.  Just start burning your money at home, and the dollar will go back up.  Just tell the Chinese that the dollars they own are worthless.  Yeah.  Why is our money going down the toilet?  I don't get it.  It's not because there's too much printed why our money isn't worth anything.  No, first of all, they lowered the interest rate, and that kind of hurt us.  That's why Canadians' money, the Canadians' money, shut up.  Let's go to Jim in Wilkes-Barre before this moment passes.  Make some money less worthy, worth anything.  Jim, go.  Hey, boss, just want to know, you don't have to worry about rolling over on your kid. 
[01:45:30]  It's drooling on your kid, grounding the kid.  Jesus Christ, boss.  Yeah, he's basically saying if the kid is sleeping between you two, there's a risk of the baby drowning.  No, you've got to see my pill.  Like, I drink those crystal lights that, you know, the...  No.  Because you believe in you.  No, but here's the thing.  And there's soap right there.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  It's soap.  Five years ago, that would have just been water.  Okay.  I said wait because I'm keeping track of the here's the things today. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, okay.  I've had it with him and it's here's the thing.  If you could hit the bell when you hear it too, Ant, that would...  Oh, I would never remember.  Because, Rich, you do this.  I'll try.  You say, here's the thing.  And then nothing comes.  I've been waiting for the thing.  Okay.  And so I wake up after drinking and my pillow is all red and stained and my sheets from drooling  redness.  He's drooling crystal light.  It looks like it's my face. 
[01:46:30]  It's my face's time of the month all over the pillow.  Do you sleep?  Do you swallow it or do you just like put it in your mouth and then lay your head and go  off?  Just let it drool out.  I know.  I'm kidding.  Oh.  Oh.  And we got a lot of parents checking in.  They're saying, oh, my God, Voss, not the family bed.  You should not.  No.  Never.  Start this out with the newborn sleeping with you guys because then the kid's never going  to leave the bed.  And guess what happens?  Guess what happens to you, my friend?  First of all, no privacy for you and Bonnie.  No privacy.  If parents are listening to you guys, what good parents could they possibly be? 
[01:47:00]  We have a lot of parents listening to us.  Good?  Really?  Yeah, we do, Voss.  Don't take a personal comment.  You're molding a human being's personality right now.  I just got upset because I talked about his parents' listeners.  We got a lot of listeners that have kids.  Yes.  It's time to acknowledge that crap.  All right.  Well, all right.  Here's the thing.  Oh, boy.  Hold on.  Hit the bell.  Yes.  Yes, Voss.  In the beginning.  Okay.  And here comes the nothingness that Jimmy pointed out.  He's going to quote the Bible. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  Go ahead.  It's okay.  But when the baby turns like, you know, a couple months, then you got to make sure it  can't sleep.  Well, you know, maybe six months and not sleep between you because then it gets used to it.  Here's the thing.  Bonnie is so loving this baby.  Voss does too.  He's had children.  Bonnie is so enthralled with this baby.  She doesn't want to spend a moment away from it.  She cannot put it down.  You got to see the happiness and joy in her face.  I can never bring that to her.  Or anything in life, could you bring that to?  How about a smile?  Could you bring a smile?  Could you make someone happy to see you? 
[01:48:00]  Just not a frown.  Bonnie is just so in love with this baby, but you can't smother it in the sense that  because the kid's never going to want to leave the bed.  I mean, I know that.  I'm telling you.  You got to put the kid out on the steps when it sleeps.  You put it in a crib on the steps and tell it to shut up.  That's how you raise a baby.  You yell at it through the window.  Shut up.  Bad baby.  In the winter.  Let's go to Dave in Pittsburgh.  Dave, what's up?  What's up, boy? 
[01:48:30]  Hey.  Poor fan and his useless break sign.  I know.  It's awful.  You can't have your cake and kill Voss, too.  Yeah.  You can't have your cake and kill Voss, too.  You could have made a better one than that.  You could have said you can't have your cake and do something funny, which I can't  think of either, obviously.  But that wasn't it.  No.  Kill Voss?  Why?  Yeah, that's not nice.  No, it's not nice.  That's not nice.  I take that as a threat.  Fan just threw away his break sign.  He should.  All right.  We'll take a break.  How about that?  That's what we do now.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:49:00]  Hi.  This is Chris Cornell, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Before the break, we were talking about a swastika in a cornfield.  Swastika.  You see these every season.  You know, they've got to cut some fine designs in the cornfields.  Yeah.  And, well, this guy, I'm assuming it's a guy that took it to the next level here.  Another message of hate was cut into a cornfield in New Jersey.  You can't see it from the ground, but a state police helicopter spotted the swastika in a  Washington township field on Friday. 
[01:49:30]  Several acres of stalks were crushed and ruined.  And police say it must have taken the Carver's hours to finish that symbol.  I want to offend flying Jews.  It's the flying Jew.  Jews in a plane are the problem.  They spy on us.  What, are you going to offend a Jew for half a second?  What is that?  I don't know.  We're gone.  You can't see it from the ground.  And you'll notice on the left side of the aircraft.  Ladies and gentlemen, the right side of the aircraft, if you look out, you can see lovely 
[01:50:00]  fields, the fields of farms.  Look out on the other side of the aircraft.  Any Jews might want to turn their head and watch the movie.  We've got a copy of Schindler's List on the plane.  It's going to feel a little better than what's outside the window.  It's a swastika.  Don't be a, no, it's not a swastika.  It's just a new, it's a new airport with very curvy runways. 
[01:50:30]  That's China.  Oh, Jesus.  You didn't notice something in that clip, though.  The newsreader was more disturbed that the corn stalks were ruined.  Yes.  Listen again.  Many stalks were killed.  Listen to how the newsreader's annoyed because, like, the corn stalks were ruined.  Listen.  Another message of hate was cut into a cornfield in New Jersey.  You can't see it from the ground, but a state police helicopter spotted the swastika in  a Washington township field on Friday.  Here it comes.  Several acres of stalks were crushed and ruined. 
[01:51:00]  They say it must be ruined.  Were crushed and ruined.  Oh.  Yeah, that's the problem there.  A corn.  Hey, by the way.  Old corn going, never again.  By the way, our pal Bill O'Reilly put his foot in his mouth.  Again.  If we can find the story, I don't know all the details.  Sylvia's in Harlem.  Yeah, he went to a black restaurant.  It's a black restaurant, basically.  Very famous here.  Oh, my black owners, the cooks, everybody in the joint is black. 
[01:51:30]  Cook.  And he was amazed that the restaurant ran so well, like, our white restaurants.  Oops.  Or something like that.  I'm paraphrasing.  We need the details.  Yikes.  He put his foot in his mouth.  If we can get that clip, that would be great.  It's almost like implying that black people don't eat.  What, are you stupid?  White Americans invented the restaurant?  It was amazing.  They took an order, brought it to the kitchen, and then food came out.  Did he think that black people ordered food and then just threw it at each other from the kitchen? 
[01:52:00]  He probably thought he'd end up in a big iron pot in the kitchen with them stirring it with Bugs Bunny.  It's actually a very famous restaurant here in New York.  They serve soul food.  I don't even know what they serve.  I don't know, but he was amazed by the service because, you know, it's owned by black people.  Wow.  He's an ass.  He really is not as big of an ass as the Iranian president.  I am speaking at Columbia University.  Before we talk about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 
[01:52:30]  Ahmadinejad.  Yeah, I think you're pretty close.  You're closer than anyone's going to get.  Ahmadinejad.  Ahmadinejad.  You want some Ahmadinejad?  Ahmadinejad.  Ahmadinejad.  My grandmother, rest in peace.  We know.  She was a saint.  We get it.  Made the best sauce.  Bless us all.  Rest in peace.  Rest in peace. 
[01:53:00]  Hey.  On the eyes of my children.  They're always gambling away organs of loved ones.  What's with the Italians?  I don't think I've ever bet my mother's organs on anything.  Hey.  On my mother's right breast and her left ovary.  Hey.  On my mother's bung.  All right.  My hand to my grandmother's uterus.  This is the best sauce.  Hey.  On my father's little bone, this stirrup in the ear. 
[01:53:30]  Just really nitpicking with parts.  Yeah.  I swear.  On my grandfather's vast difference.  Oh, wow.  Hey.  On my uncle's epiglottis.  I swear this is the truth.  Oh, she will make a man I got.  And make your mouth water.  Your mouth and water.  The man I got.  That she is to make.  Hey.  Hey.  On my children's septum. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, it does sound like an Italian dish there.  Amada Dinajad.  Amada Dinajad.  Amada Dinajad.  This is Stuart Copeland and you're listening to your radio.  The worst of opium and...  Hey, let's talk to Mr. DVD.  Hey, Mr. DVD.  Mr. DVD.  Hey, gentlemen.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Lively afternoon, isn't it?  Well, we get in these very heated debates.  We need to bring the humor back into the show and we'll do that right after we talk to Mr. DVD.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Who is Mr. DVD?  Mr. DVD knows everything about DVDs.  What's coming out.  The special features they have.  The Easter eggs that are hidden on some of these DVDs.  Hey, I got to ask you a question.  Shoot.  Mr. DVD.  Very big DVD coming out and it seems to be being pitched as the DVD of all time.  Planet of the Apes.  The remake.  What kind of features are going to be on this thing and is it worth it since the movie blew?  Comment, Mr. DVD.  I've seen it and you're right.  The movie is pretty indifferent, but there are some great featurettes on it. 
[01:55:00]  Things like makeup tests, stunt test footage, two different commentary tracks.  And what about this changing of camera angles?  There is stuff where you can use a multi-angle feature to like mock edit the film.  Mock edit the film.  Why don't they give the public the opportunity to do that before they released it?  Might have played out a little better.  The multi-angle feature, very few discs use it, but you can use it for stuff like on the Matrix. 
[01:55:30]  You use it to activate these small making of featurettes on the disc and what have you.  So, you know, it gives people a different perspective.  But it's still the same crappy movie.  Do you need a different perspective if you're a guy that goes out and gets laid?  I'm not sure.  I've got to tell you, the stuff on Planet of the Apes is pretty interesting, but you're right.  A great DVD can't make a bad film good, but it can make a bad film interesting.  Ah, where have I heard that before?  Last time he was on.  Oh, right, last time he was on. 
[01:56:00]  Thank you, boss.  I knew I had heard that before.  And it was last week.  Yeah.  Yeah, we enjoyed Mr. DVD.  Hey, Mr. DVD, did you see Harry Potter?  Yes, I did, actually.  What did you think of the Harry Potter movie?  You know, it's weird because it's two and a half hours long.  It's like the Gone with the Wind of kids movies, but...  All the kids there enjoyed it.  All the grown-ups seemed to enjoy it.  The tone is pretty much perfect, and it was way better than I expected from, you know,  the director of Bicentennial Man and Mrs. Doubtfire. 
[01:56:30]  Mr. DVD, I've got a question.  Rich Voss with a question.  Are you a bottom or a top?  When I play softball.  What?  I have a serious question.  Is that the type of material we can expect to be hearing?  No, no.  All new stuff.  Are you a bottom or top, honey?  Oh, now I know what he's asking.  Okay.  Yeah.  Mr. DVD?  Just take in.  Mr. DVD? 
[01:57:00]  Mr. DVD?  Jim Norton wants to ask a question.  Did you ever sit down with Mr. Moviefone and discuss who should hang themselves first?  No, Mr. Moviefone and I don't hang out and chat that much, nor have we ever discussed  who should hang themselves first.  Well, let's try to get a little more out of Mr. DVD.  Any more DVDs coming out?  One of the new ones coming out this week or next week?  There's a bunch of stuff coming out in the near future.  Nothing really that interesting next week.  But on the Tuesday after that, on the 4th, there's a couple of... 
[01:57:30]  Anthony, he cannot hear us right now.  Yes.  It's time to play the silent game.  Okay.  The Pearl Harbor two-disc set.  The director's cut of Almost Famous, which is actually going to be pretty interesting  because I'm more interested in seeing the director's cut of Almost Famous than I am in seeing the  actual theatrical release.  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:58:00]  Hello?  Isn't that the most painful thing to have to sit through?  Hello?  Did they dump out of that?  Hello?  I think he said something at the end.  I couldn't quite make it out.  I don't think it was audible.  Find out if they dumped out because it...  Oh, my God. 
[01:58:30]  Is that funny?  He said hello twice and then...  Oh, he's back.  Hold on.  Let's make like something's wrong with the phone.  Mr. DVD?  Yes.  Hi.  Sorry.  We had a new phone system put in.  It's still screwing up.  I understand.  We didn't hear the last part of that.  Hold on.  A lot of great stuff is coming out of the 4th.  Mr. Movie Phone?  Hold on a minute.  Oh, Mr. DVD.  Sorry.  Ben, make sure he knows about that problem.  Okay?  Can I ask real quick, too, before you describe this, if you...  Mr. HIV, I wanted to know.  It's Mr. DVD. 
[01:59:00]  Paul, is that so witty?  He's blaming Colin for it.  That was Jim Norton.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I know it's something you would have expected out of Colin.  Jim Norton, you're indistinguishable from Colin, and that was so witty.  All right.  So where are we, Mr. DVD?  Pete Johnson's on the phone thing, though.  A bunch of great stuff on December the 4th, including the two-disc set of Pearl Harbor,  which you don't want to rush out and get because they're doing a three-disc set in May.  Let's try this again.  This fool is going for it again.  We are playing a silent game.  He has no clue that we're doing this today. 
[01:59:30]  Also, both Bill and Ted films come out on the 4th as well.  All right, that time he cursed.  Okay, all right, all right.  That time he cursed.  All right, that time he cursed.  He's sitting there with Vic.  Because the phones have been dropping out.  And then he hung up.  Oh, that's too bad that he cursed.  Gee, you know something?  Here, I think he's calling. 
[02:00:00]  Go for three.  Go for three.  All right, right off the bat.  Painful.  Mr. DVD?  Are these phone problems like the equivalent of yawning and stretching when you have people  over for dinner?  What?  What's that mean?  No, Mr. DVDs.  Yeah.  No, we've had...  Are you on a better phone right now?  I think it's us.  Oh.  I think it might be you, humans.  Mr. DVD, we had...  You know, we've recently been syndicated.  Yeah.  So now we have our local and our syndicated phone lines.  And sometimes when the guy out front hangs up on the syndicated phone line, it hangs up 
[02:00:30]  on the line you're calling in on.  We're going to make sure now that nobody picks up or hangs up on the syndicated phone  line.  And I apologize.  I did hear something about Bill and Ted.  Both Bill and Ted films come out on the 4th, yes.  Bill and Ted on the 4th.  Anything special with those DVDs?  Not as far as I know, although I know that the one actor, Alex Winter, is probably eminently  available to do a commentary or a documentary, or for that matter, play your  child's bar mitzvah.  Alex Winter's career has not taken off as Keanu Reeves has. 
[02:01:00]  All right, well...  I can't take it.  I can't take it.  It's definitely funnier for us because he's cursing.  It's going to be great with the bleeps in it.  Believe me.  Yeah, well, we're going to love it with the bleeps in it.  Well, basically...  He's cursing like crazy.  Wait, here he calls.  God damn it. 
[02:01:30]  What the F is calling his line?  If we can't get this phone fixed...  He's calling back?  You know, if we had a good guest on, we'd be really embarrassed.  What line is he on?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hi, Mr. DVD.  Mr. DVD.  If you had a good guest on, you'd be really embarrassed?  Damn it.  That's great.  If you had a good guest on, would you be less embarrassing?  I'm sorry.  I didn't know you were on the line, and I didn't mean that.  I'm just getting a little upset about the phone situation.  Actually, Mr. DVD, Anthony was trying to be funny there.  He actually knew you were listening.  It wasn't a good joke.  I'm sorry, Mr. DVD.  It's all...  No, it's all good fun.  It's all good fun. 
[02:02:00]  We're just roughhousing a little bit.  No, we're not.  Okay.  That was Colin Quinn again.  That was...  That's not Jim Norton.  That's Colin Quinn.  You throw a girl down, and you teabag her at gunpoint.  That's roughhousing.  All right, Mr. DVD.  So, we got some info out about Bill and Ted.  What else can you tell us?  On the 11th, you get a very loaded disc for Rush Hour 2.  No.  On the 11th, you get a great DVD for Jurassic Park 3.  Oh, no.  And also, for you Planet of the Apes fans, last week, not only did you have Planet of the 
[02:02:30]  Apes, the remake, but a four-disc box set of Planet of the Apes, the TV show, which  is...  I can't take it.  This is painful.  He goes back and goes like that joke about the guy that goes bear hunting and keeps hitting  the side of my face. 
[02:03:00]  This is painful, man.  Holy shit.  There's no way.  And if Pete Johnson would show his ass here and fix this problem, there wouldn't be...  Mr. DVD?  Is he here today, Ben?  Yes.  I'm sorry.  You know, we might have to reschedule this, because we're having problems.  We've had this problem all day.  I'm sorry.  I completely understand. 
[02:03:30]  What we'll do is I'll get in touch with Ben, and we'll figure it out, man.  Yeah, maybe we can reschedule it when Pete's here.  Our engineer, for some reason, decides he's just going to take off the day before Thanksgiving  and leave early.  And now we have a phone problem.  We have a highly rated afternoon show and no phones.  15 cities are going through this with us, Mr. DVD.  It seems, though, that it has to be something with the computer, because it seems like we  get 30 or 40 seconds out of you and then nothing.  And then it drops out. 
[02:04:00]  What's going on on your end?  Do you hear anything at all?  I don't.  You know what?  I don't hear anything.  I'll be talking, and then it'll just go silent, and I think, God, I'm really boring.  Are you on a cell phone or a wireless?  No, I'm on a hard line.  I'm at a hotel.  I'm on a landline.  Wait, wait.  But it goes silent?  Yeah, it goes silent.  In what way?  Do you hear a click or something?  I don't hear anything coming back on the other end.  I don't hear you guys cutting in.  I don't hear you guys talking.  But there's no dial tone?  It's just silent?  Just dead.  And then I swear, and then I hang up, and I dial back in. 
[02:04:30]  Hello?  What a toll.  What a toll.  Five times.  Five times.  It's a new record.  Wait, wait.  No, no.  I can't do it again.  Why not?  No. 
[02:05:00]  Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson.  Hey.  No, come on.  You know.  And now we've got to sit with our phone screwing up for the rest of the show, which is another  hour and a half.  This is great.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pete.  Mr. DVD?  Yes.  We've got to give up on this.  I'll call you guys some other time.  Thank you very kindly, gentlemen.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We'll have to reschedule it.  What, Jim?  Jim.  Quick question, because we don't know.  Maybe 20 seconds and he'll cut out again. 
[02:05:30]  God damn it.  All right.  Mr. DVD, we'll reschedule?  Absolutely.  Okay.  All right.  Well, keep thinking about witticism until then, Jim.  Oh, a little dig at Jim Norton.  Mr. DVD, why are you hitting me with singers like that?  He knew you were setting him up, Jim.  A little dig at Jim Norton.  This Mr. DVD is not as stupid as you think.  Well, you have to get up pretty early in the morning to put one over on you.  You know what?  I've got something that I've always wondered about as far as DVD goes. 
[02:06:00]  You still there, Mr. DVD?  Yes, I am.  Stupid freaking phones.  Why can't I get a lot more older stuff on DVD?  It's taken a long time for them to get from video to a DVD on a lot of the older movies  that I would love to see.  Like Godfather.  It took forever to get Godfather on DVD.  It took forever.  No, I'm not even talking like the high-end movies.  I mean, kind of the cheesier B films or something.  Are those ever going to make it to DVD?  Because I'd like to eventually throw my VCR away, but for some of those movies, I've  still got to do it.  Are we going to be seeing a changeover of those movies? 
[02:06:30]  We will.  Well, it does take a while to restore it.  All right, Ken, you're a silent disc.  Good question.  Oh, he slammed it down.  He's breathing.  Two sides.  Click.  All right.  He's called back seven times.  Seven freaking times.  Imagine being a girl breaking up with him.  Holy.  Hey, man, Ann and I know better than anyone that we know how to, you know, pound a bit
