<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Greg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing the show, noting Opie's absence due to a humorous, self-diagnosed illness (severe stomach flu possibly caused by semen ingestion).  The conversation immediately shifted to E-Rock's birthday celebration at a Brazilian steakhouse, where his strategic meat selection and subsequent sangria consumption led to a food coma.  His gifts, including a Wii U, games, and a Jambox, sparked discussions about cleaning services and online anonymity, touching upon the irony of online hate speech and the potential for technology to both expose and protect individuals.  This led to a speculative discussion about a future devoid of human emotion, engineered through technological manipulation.  The show then transitioned to a similar hypothetical scenario regarding the mapping and removal of negative emotions and personality traits.

This segued into a discussion of Dennis Rodman's visits to North Korea and his positive portrayal of Kim Jong-un, including analysis of Rodmanâ€™s interviews and criticism of George Stephanopoulos's interview approach.  Joe Piscopo called in briefly to discuss his career.  A humorous anecdote about Jim Norton's painful sexual encounter was shared, followed by discussions about the struggles of 80s bands, Justin Bieber's "worst birthday ever," and the stark contrast between Rodman's views and the realities of North Korean human rights abuses. The hosts recounted a story about a filmmaker couple kidnapped and forced to make propaganda films, touching upon Stockholm Syndrome and the Colleen Stan case.

The next segment started with contrasting opinions on Barack Obama's presidency, followed by comedic tangents and promotions for Anthony Jeselnik's show and Anthony Cumia's motivational tour (featuring highly offensive language).  The serious tone returned with a discussion of a Florida sinkhole that killed Jeff Bush, followed by the tragic hit-and-run death of a Hasidic couple,  with their baby initially surviving but later succumbing to injuries.  The hosts debated the religious implications and the absurdity of attributing such tragedies to divine intervention, using offensive language throughout their commentary.  A discussion of a former colleague's negative experience with someone named "Scorch" was followed by brief promotion of Gillian Jacobs and *Community*, opinions on Chevy Chase and *Portlandia*, and discussions about social media, eugenics, and racist websites.  The segment concluded with commentary on a Selma March anniversary event, Joe Biden's gaffes compared to Dan Quayle's, and the hosts' emotional responses, particularly Anthony's inability to cry.

The show then shifted to a discussion about what makes the hosts emotional, focusing on movies that make them cry, including *Saving Private Ryan*, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, and *Ghost*.  The revelation that one host had made out during *Schindler's List* elicited shocked reactions.  The arrival of Gillian Jacobs was excitedly anticipated, leading into a segment with the actress discussing her career in indie films, her childhood, awkwardness,  Shakespeare (including a funny anecdote about Martin Short), and her experiences on *Community*.  The conversation also touched on social media, Jacobs' Twitter followers, and the hosts' interactions with her and other celebrities.

The final segment focused on the fakery of reality TV, a scathing critique, using vulgar and misogynistic language, of Lauren Silberman's failed NFL tryout, promotion of Jim Norton's stand-up shows, further discussion about crying during movies, and an interview with Andrew Jenks. Jenks discussed his MTV show, *World of Jenks*, detailing dangerous experiences filming, including an encounter with armed gangsters in Miami and time spent in a nursing home.  He described his experiences documenting animal slaughter, his book (70% pictures), and his upcoming season focusing on cancer, autism, and gun violence, including a returning autistic subject, Chad. He also recounted a near-physical altercation with rapper Maino.  Jenks promoted his book signing and the premiere of his show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is he at me? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ooh.  What that music means.  Get the fuck to work.  Yeah.  That's what it means.  Ah, it's like you hear the whistle blow.  What do you want to do?  Ah, the whistle on the job site.  Yep, there we go.  Get to work. Get your lunch panel.  Toot toot, suit up.  Let's get to work.  Come on, guys.  We got a job to do.  Come on, gents.  Open up the gang box.  Get the tools. 
[00:01:30]  It's time to go to work.  Man.  All right.  How's everyone doing today?  Good.  I hope after a big, uh, big weekend.  Everyone have a good weekend?  I sure hope so.  Yeah.  These are all rhetorical questions.  I'm just asking the listeners.  That's what I was told when I first got into this business.  You're speaking to the listeners.  Not really the people in the room.  Talking to me that time?  Wave to Sam.  Oh.  Uh, Opie is, uh, he's out today.  Jim, any clue? 
[00:02:00]  He's very, very sick.  Um, it's a stomach flu.  Oh.  Um, and they don't know what it is, but there's been something going around, which is been transferred.  It's from semen.  Oh.  And it gets into the stomach, so we have no comment as to how Opie made it.  We don't know.  He's not saying.  Is there any way semen can get into the stomach other than, you know, what we all would imagine,  how it gets in there?  That's the only way.  No, no, it's, it's, but no, they say this is, this is when it happens when you gargle it  and you don't swallow it. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  It's when you gargle with it and then you spit it out.  It's what leaks down your throat into your stomach.  Oh.  So I hope he's okay because it's a, it's a very nasty stomach flu.  Ah.  Well, I, uh, I hope he, uh, he feels better.  Yeah.  Because, um, he took the day.  I like that.  I was, right when I got the, uh, the little text, I'm like, how can I spin this into me  not coming in?  How can I twist this around where the boss would go like, of course he would take off 
[00:03:00]  because of that.  Everyone's sick.  There must be a bug going around.  Oh, yeah.  The whole show is sick.  I have the same thing.  The semen in the stomach.  Yes, you do.  Semen in the stomach.  Ah.  It's a terrible bug.  So, uh, I know I, I had a pretty fun weekend.  Nothing, nothing great to speak of.  Obviously, nothing as great as what, uh, the birthday boys weekend must have been like.  Our own E of the rock.  E to the R.  Uh, it was his birthday weekend.  Of course, Friday we had those wonderful heroes. 
[00:03:30]  It was so good.  Like, the middle of the weekend, I started thinking like, God, I should have taken like  five of those home with me.  How much did, I had one section of one hero, that was it.  Yeah.  I had the Danny Aiello.  A quarter.  Yeah, it was so goddamn good.  That was fucking amazing.  The chicken and the little broccoli rabe on it.  The broccoli rabe.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was pretty goddamn good.  But then I'm like, uh, you know, Saturday I'm going, I should have taken like five.  Take them home, put them in the fridge.  Um, so we were celebrating, you know, the, the beginning of the E-Rock birthday weekend.  Yeah.  Um, and now I just want to know what happened. 
[00:04:00]  Because all I got out of E-Rock was the fact that, um, he, he really,  uh, indulged for his, uh, birthday.  E-Rock comment?  Oh, yes, I did.  At the, uh, Brazilian restaurant?  Yeah, you said you were going to that place where they, uh.  Oh, Plata Forma?  No.  Was it?  Oh, I love Plata Forma.  It's good, right?  I went to one in New Jersey.  Okay.  Jersey?  And, uh.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Nice work, Lou.  I, uh.  Was there a toilet with the pull chain?  Exactly.  Did you order the veal?  You could put the hamburgers behind the toilet. 
[00:04:30]  E-Rock is putting on his fucking, his little Simpsons bib.  How's the Italian food in this place?  I'm going to speak moron with E-Rock now.  A grosser physical spectacle.  Sorry.  We're just doing salato.  If anything happens to my chicken parm, I'm gone.  E-Rock, um, so you went to, uh, the Brazilian place where they slice off that meat. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  Huge portions of meat.  Did you, uh, pay attention to the, um, the strategy?  Yes.  Whether they bring the beginning meats they bring.  Oh, like the cheaper ones.  Yeah.  And they want you to fill up on that, so when they come up, uh, come around with the good  stuff, you go, oh, and you flip your little paddle over to red, because you don't want  no more.  Yeah, the first four rounds were, uh, just, no thank you.  Not interested.  Really?  You know.  It must have been so hard.  Oh, my God.  They're probably talking about that in the back.  Not, not even just a joke on Eric, but, like, just to see that food and just pass on it. 
[00:05:30]  Because you go, they are hungry, so when they bring in the stuff at first, you just want  to eat anything, and then, uh, you gotta pass, no, I'm waiting for the good stuff.  Anything wrapped in bacon are the lesser meats.  Ah, ah, I see you've come dressed in bacon today.  Lesser meat.  In high school, he was voted, meat most likely to be lesser than.  E-Rock.  So, uh, no.  Uh, so you, so you waited.  Yeah.  Ah, it must have been good. 
[00:06:00]  Would you go with the little lady?  W-E-I-G-H-T-E-D.  It's gonna be a long.  It really is.  It really is.  So, uh, you went with the little, little woman.  Anyone else?  Yeah, a couple, uh, friends.  We went out to dinner.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, after the first four rounds, passed on all that.  Wow.  And then the good meat started coming out.  Ah, now you're talking about digging in.  You're talking, um, filet mignon, talking, uh, sirloining in garlic. 
[00:06:30]  Ooh.  Garlic buttersaw?  They had, uh, ribeye with, uh, melted mozzarella.  Mmm.  Oh, my God.  See, those are the ones I never get, even though they're delicious.  Yeah.  But they're just too much, so I'll always get, like, a little lean cut of this and that,  and I never get that fucking garlic stuff.  I should try it.  Oh, I love that stuff.  It's good, right?  Oh, God.  Very good.  Fucking starving, too.  Very good.  It's terrible.  That and a lot of sangria to go with it.  Ah.  So you're not a drinker, are you?  I'm getting there.  He's working on it.  Yeah, I'm working on it.  The last year has been a, been a growth experience. 
[00:07:00]  That's nice.  That's not a fat joke.  I wouldn't say that.  I mean, emotionally, I think you've grown.  Yes, right.  Yeah.  So.  Sangria, though?  Sangria.  Isn't that, like, cheap fucking puke stuff?  Yeah.  Like, you will throw up if you're drinking sangria.  It's terrible.  That's what a group of girls will get if you go out to a bar.  Yeah.  They used to have, remember a place called Beefsteak Charlie's?  Yes.  Back in what I call the day?  They used to have unlimited beer and sangria, and they'd bring over pitchers.  Yeah.  Beer pitchers full of fucking sangria, and if you'd just keep drinking, 
[00:07:30]  it, and you'd throw up at the end of the night.  You'd puke up, and it'd look like you're throwing up blood.  Maybe it's his weight loss plan.  Oh, is that it?  Sort of bulimia through alcohol?  You're just not making it right.  Oh, is that it?  What's in it?  Isn't it?  What is it?  You rocked the sangria expert.  It's gravy with schlitz poured into it.  Schlitz.  Schlitz.  That's a good drinking beer.  Go ahead.  What is it?  Well, they make, it's all pre-made now, so a lot of people just buy the bottles, 
[00:08:00]  but you can't just do the bottle of sangria.  You've got to chop up the fruit with it.  Then you put some gin, some triple sec, and some brandy with it.  Oh, there is some, like, other booze in sangria?  And you make it the night before.  Isn't it wine?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you make it the night before, so it all, it soaks in.  You can make it in a bunch of different ways.  I don't even want to fucking make it.  It sounds like, so sangria is a wine, but you mix it with three other liquors.  It's a, like, fruit-based wine, like, punch.  Okay.  Almost.  Sounds like jungle juice.  Yeah, it's, yeah.  I mean. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, that's terrible.  Just make it in a tub with sherbet.  No, it's delicious.  Like Sunny D.  Sunny Delight.  Whatever that is.  Is it orange juice?  I don't know.  Even when he gets drunk, he wants a delicious treat.  Of course he does.  Why not?  Yes, so you're drinking sangria and enjoying the meat.  Enjoying the meat.  That's good.  He likes sweet.  Yes, sweet.  And then, yeah, as soon as we got home, I passed out.  Oh, you passed out on your birthday?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  No birthday sex?  I was, I food coma-ed out.  You did?  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  And then it was Sunday.  Holy shit.  What time was it?  11.30?  Oh, man.  11.30 on a Saturday night.  On his birthday.  On his birthday.  Oh, you didn't even throw the wife one?  Good thing you made love to that steak.  Exactly.  He fucking adored the steak.  It was delicious.  Cherished it.  Did you have dessert?  No.  Oh, yeah.  We had some dessert.  Oh.  And I'm not usually a dessert guy.  No, he doesn't have a sweet tooth.  We've learned that over the years. 
[00:09:30]  What did you have?  They had some, um, it was some kind of, like, banana bread little cake thing.  God, do I love a banana-y snack?  I love banana bread.  Banana bread's fucking rule.  Anything, anything, like, dessert-y with banana tastes amazing.  It's the best.  Banana bread pudding or some shit.  Oh, fuck.  Banana Foster.  Oh.  Very nice.  That's a favorite, too.  What is it?  I said Banana Foster's is a favorite, too.  What's that?  I don't know.  It's good stuff.  It's a little, uh, caramel.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  You just know what you're doing in.  Caramel, whipped cream, banana.  It's great.  Yeah.  It's delicious.  That sounds good.  My God.  So you go home.  It's 11.30.  You pass out.  Yeah.  How'd you get home?  Um, we had other people drive us home.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yeah.  Designated drivers, or were they?  We cabbed it there, and then other people brought us home.  Were they drinking sangria as well?  Uh, the people driving, no.  No?  No.  Come on.  It's too bad.  Who goes out and doesn't drink?  Big Kev.  Oh, okay.  I haven't seen Big Kev in a while.  In a long time.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:10:30]  It's doing good.  Yeah.  I'm doing all right.  Ooh.  So, um, uh, fun-filled conversation of action figures?  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Oh, what a fucking nerd fest that must have been.  Oh, so do you see the new collection of Simpsons toys that are out?  Well, I'm hoping when I unwrap some of my gifts, I'll see them right in front of me.  Something's in there, I think.  Um, okay, Iraq, so you pass out.  I got the invite to the dinner at, like, the last minute, though. 
[00:11:00]  I got it on Friday after I had made a stink about not getting one on the after show, and  I was so, because I couldn't go, because I already had plans for my parents on Saturday,  and I was bummed out, because I wanted to go like a douche with a notebook and just  be able to record every single little...  Oh, you should have.  I know, I wanted to.  You know he'd be the worst guy to take to your birthday, because he would.  I didn't get invited either.  I didn't either.  No one here did.  No one got an invite to the Iraq festivities.  I like fucking the Brazilian places.  I could talk fucking geeky shit.  Yeah, well, why don't you invite the guys? 
[00:11:30]  You don't come to anything.  What?  They did.  Him and Tom...  Him and both went to Tom Papa's house on last Monday.  Yeah.  Monday went to Tom Papa's house.  Oh, come on.  You never invite me.  Oh, that's bullshit.  I invited you over to summer.  One party that...  Fucking...  What happened to that party?  Didn't he know that you couldn't...  Wasn't there a time he invited...  He had a party when he knew me and Ann couldn't go, or me and O couldn't go?  No, it was me and you.  Me and Sam were in the...  When we were in San Diego.  But yeah.  You know something, Sam?  The After Show might be something for you to jack your fucking mic up to unrealistic proportions,  but maybe you could tame it down during this program. 
[00:12:00]  They're all the same.  What?  I guess this is Obie's magic mic.  They're all loud.  Is this better?  Holy shit.  That's better.  Okay.  Thank you.  So, Iraq.  Mm-hmm?  So, I want to talk about your gifts.  Yes.  What did you get?  Now, this is your 35th birthday.  Mm-hmm.  35 years young.  And what's some of the gifts that were given to you?  Who gave them to you?  And when did you start opening them?  Yeah.  I started opening some of them on Saturday morning when I got up. 
[00:12:30]  I love it.  He's a child.  He wakes up and runs downstairs.  So excited.  You almost fell in your feetie pajamas.  Yes.  The little hatch in the back is flipped down, his ass hanging out.  Yeah, there's a cum leaking out of it.  Little turtle handprints, because a ninja turtle came in and sodomized him.  It's just thud, thud, thud down the stairs, and the cat runs away in a panic. 
[00:13:00]  Just trudging.  Oh, E-Rock.  So it's Saturday morning, you just can't wait.  You're all excited.  It's birthday morning.  When was the last time anyone in this room was excited about their birthday?  I could probably say seven years old.  Seven.  I was very excited.  Every year my wife will be like, you want to open your present?  I'll be like, yeah, whatever.  I gotta take a shit first.  Something.  But E-Rock, 35 years old, running down the stairs, eyes all open wide in amazement. 
[00:13:30]  What time did you wake up Saturday morning?  11.30.  Alright, that's not that bad.  His wife made sure he had the grips on his socks, because she knew he would slip.  He'd be so excited.  Well, she's probably learning to keep the presents upstairs, so that he doesn't hurt himself  going down the steps.  I'll keep him in this room.  You don't think he slid down the banister?  Oh, that's true.  No, he tried.  He jumped down the banister and just smashed.  Oh, yeah, he tried to, and you might have heard of somebody with a house in Florida. 
[00:14:00]  It sunk.  So now your gifts are wrapped, obviously.  And where are they in the house?  They were in the dining room.  They were on the dining room table.  On the dining room table, all waiting.  Were they there the night before?  No, they were not.  No, they magically appeared.  Did she wake up early and put your gifts out?  Yeah.  That's not a birthday thing.  That's a Christmas thing.  That's a good wife, though.  The gifts could just be sitting there, and no one would give him any mind at 35.  It's kind of funny. 
[00:14:30]  Sam's right.  That is a good wife.  It is a good wife.  She knows that he'd be excited by it.  Of course she is.  That is true.  She probably woke up nice and early, just saw him slumbering there, and was caught between  choking him with a phone cord and putting his gifts out.  She's like, should I put his gifts out or just strangle him to death?  Just end it all.  All that fucking energy she had from sexual frustration.  From her passed out lumpy cider.  Exactly.  It's like when they're trying to wake De Niro up in Raging Bull to tell him he's got sexual  charges against him.  Champ.  Wake up, champ. 
[00:15:00]  So, yeah, you go over to the table, and...  Can I ask you, how did you know that they were downstairs?  When you woke up, did she tell you?  Did she wake you, or did you just wake up and go downstairs?  I just woke up and went downstairs.  Bolted straight up in bed.  It's my birthday.  Oh, it's my birthday.  So you run downstairs, yeah, and...  Never mind.  Well, huh?  Nothing.  I was going to say something.  Yeah, that's what you were.  Comment?  I was going to say, I had to get up before the cleaning people came in to clean the house,  so...  Ooh.  Downstairs.  Cleaning.  Well, I'm sure Troy Kwan will have something to say about that. 
[00:15:30]  We're going to say, well, it's...  Yeah.  Oh, people.  I have people for that.  The cleaning people.  The cleaning people.  Well, when you buy a house, you need cleaning people to go over there.  You do.  Absolutely.  You do.  They've got to come in there.  I don't know what that's like.  Write that down for the after show.  On a fucking Saturday, you have cleaning people over?  That's crazy, right?  Why would you do that?  What?  Every two weeks, they come on Saturday.  Why on Saturday?  It's like, that's where you want to spend time again.  You don't trust them to, like, some places give cleaning crews a key to clean their house  when they're not there.  Yeah, because they're Mexicans. 
[00:16:00]  You don't trust them, right?  Is that what you were going to say?  Comment, Iraq?  Racism.  We don't trust them to leave them alone.  El comente, Iraq?  So do you just follow them around from room in room?  No, we're just there, but we make sure everything is done.  How do you know if they take stuff out of the dresser?  Do you weigh the dresser before they get there and then when they leave?  What are you afraid they're going to steal?  Some of them action figures?  Yeah, he comes back.  He's like fucking Kathy Bates in misery.  He sees his Hulk Hogan is facing the other way and he knows something happened. 
[00:16:30]  He knows something happened during his absence.  You've got to hobble those fuckers.  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having cleaning people that the entire time they're  there, you just have to lazily sit in the house and wait for them to finish?  Yes.  Like, shouldn't you be able to go out and do other things?  Or how about it after work?  You have them come after you get home.  I have one person come once a week during the week and when I get home, she's there.  She starts at like 8 o'clock.  It's the same one Opie uses, which is why I'm great because he's got a fucking, he's  a four bedroom house.  So if she's going to steal from either one of us, please. 
[00:17:00]  It's not going to be me.  Four Mexicans come over my house and fucking run around.  It's like Speedy Gonzales times four.  Speedy Gonzales.  It's Gonzales.  They're all over the house.  But you know what?  I fucking, I'm there like after work.  You know, even after real people's work.  You know, late.  Not my, just my stupid hours.  But, wow.  Because Saturday, I couldn't imagine like you want to just hang out on a Saturday.  You want to have the house to yourself and you and the woman there, the wife.  New toys.  Yeah, new toys. 
[00:17:30]  And then you got these fucking people running around, cleaning up.  Oh, well.  Regardless.  Let him, let him run the Nagel mansion the way he deems fit.  Yeah.  So you go to your gifts.  Yeah.  And what do you, what's the first one you open?  The biggest one.  Of course.  There's no waiting.  That would be the belt.  What is it?  It looks like a giant anaconda, but it's flat. 
[00:18:00]  So you go over and of course, you go right to the big one.  What kind of wrapping paper?  Oh, right.  Well, I posted it on my Twitter at E-Rock Radio.  It was Ninja Turtle wrapping paper.  No.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  35.  Ninja Turtle wrapping paper.  And it's not the old Ninja Turtles.  It's the new one.  It's the retro.  It's the new one that children actively watch.  Right.  That means his wife had to go into Toys R Us and go to the wrapping paper section.  And then someone said, oh, this is for your kid.  Oh, so your kid. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, how old is your little boy?  Oh, 35.  Yeah.  He's retarded, you see.  Yeah.  He's 35, so I'm wrapping it up in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle paper.  Now, did she do this to be ironic or she knew you'd kind of like it?  She knew I'd like it.  Oh.  You really like the Ninja Turtles?  I haven't gone into the new series, but I used to like the old series.  Here's what the answer to that should be.  No, I don't.  I don't care for them at all.  I used to.  When I was a child.  Right, right.  When I was a child. 
[00:19:00]  But is that the only wrapping paper over there?  Oh, that was the only.  Everything was wrapped in that.  Oh.  Ninja Turtle.  Oh, God.  I could just imagine what that looked like.  It was delightful.  I bet.  Oh, happy to see it.  Okay, so you come down, there's a bunch of green Ninja Turtle boxes all piled up, and  the biggest one was how big?  About that big.  Two feet.  Like that big?  Two feet wide.  A box.  Two feet wide.  Size of lunch.  All right, so you open that up, and what's in it, E-Rock? 
[00:19:30]  It's a new Nintendo Wii U.  Oh.  Whoa.  Wow.  I hope some games came with that.  Uh, yeah, a game came with it, but.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  What's a Wii U?  Is it the same as the Wii?  It's the new Nintendo system.  Okay.  It's got, um, wow.  It's the one that's failing miserably.  Yeah, it's not doing well.  Is it bombing?  It's the guy that bought it.  I got it for his birthday.  I'll tell you why, because people are sick and tired of that fucking dumb, childish graphics  they use. 
[00:20:00]  Well, not necessarily that.  They upgraded to HD and everything, but the price is too much for that system.  It's $350.  Is that a lot for a system?  Yeah.  That's how much you would expect to buy a PlayStation or an Xbox for.  A real system.  Yeah, that should be about $100 less.  So let me, uh, I'm looking at your gifts now, and that's everything you got?  It's nice.  Minus some gift cards, yeah.  Uh, so I'm looking, uh, and I see, um, a game.  I see, is that a game?  Wipeout?  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Wipeout 3.  Okay.  Wipeout 3.  Is that like the television show?  Yeah.  Ooh.  What's Wipeout?  It's a, it's some, it was some foreign game show that they brought to America where people  just do obstacle courses all the time, right?  No, no, no.  Yeah, it's a take on, what was it called?  Most Extreme Illumination Challenge.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  True TV's got one of those kind of fucking shows.  Uh, so, so you play that, and obviously you're the virtual person that has to go through  a little course.  Yeah.  Ah.  So you play, uh, wait, did you, did you, uh, start playing it when you're cleaning people  over the house?  I have not played it yet.  Just lounging around playing games while they fucking toil? 
[00:21:00]  Wait, are those games, Iraq, those three things?  That one is.  Oh, Wipeout's a game.  Um, okay, I'm looking at other things.  All right.  I see, uh, Monty Python, um, DVDs.  Documentary, yeah.  The only adult thing there.  Mm-hmm.  That's a documentary on Monty Python.  Mm-hmm.  I see, uh, Archer.  Season three.  Season three of Archer.  You like Archer?  I love Archer.  Which is an animated, uh, series on FX, I believe.  Yes.  Bourdain loves that, and I've never seen it.  Very good thing.  Bourdain was on last week's episode.  Okay.  Isn't that on before Legit?  That it is.  Yes.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  I've, I've heard about, uh, Archer, but I've never seen it.  I see a, uh, Mario, Mario shirt?  Yes.  It's a t-shirt.  T-shirt?  Mm-hmm.  Why would she get you that?  Mario's face on it.  Mm-hmm.  It's got Mario, it's a circle with Mario, like, hanging out of the circle, like, the old Warner Brothers.  It's his little logo, yeah.  Saying, it's a me, Mario.  It's a me.  And what did you think when you said, like, oh, cool?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I would wear that.  What size is the t-shirt?  It's an XL. 
[00:22:00]  You're not gonna fit into that.  Now, um, I'm actually surprised he's not wearing it today.  Yeah.  Do you have to wash them before you wear them?  Mm-hmm.  No, not, not like, uh, not a white shirt like that, usually.  Black one, definitely.  I get itchy if I don't wash them.  Sometimes, yeah, they're a little stiff.  So what's that, what's it, what's the, uh, video something, the white box, and then there's a...  Video capture device?  Yep.  What is that for, D-Rock?  You can, uh, it works with both Mac and PC, so you can transfer, um, uh, your old videotapes,  reel-to-reels, things like that. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, so like, uh, VCR?  Yeah.  That's a great gift.  That's actually a good gift.  That's a good one.  That's kind of grown up.  Unless it's, you're transferring videos of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to, uh...  So what do you do?  You just hook it up to a VCR?  Uh, yeah, you hook it up to a VCR.  Some of the old reel-to-reels actually have an auxiliary output, so you can hook those  in as well.  Reel-to-reels?  Or an S-Video.  And then what, you import it into iMovie or something?  You play it in real time, right into iMovie, Final Cut Pro.  Or it's got its own, I think it's got its own capture software. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, okay.  And then you take those files.  Oh, God, you're talking Greek to me.  What the hell, you on the space station?  Forget about it.  Get a container of coffee, go to the movies.  Regular Joe doesn't understand any of this.  It imports them into these massive QuickTime files.  And converts it into HD as well for you.  Oh, wow.  That's cool.  That's a very cool...  That does sound...  That's good.  And then I see something called a Jambox.  Yes.  What is that?  For the jelly?  I didn't know what that was, but it's awesome.  It's awesome.  It's this speaker that runs on Bluetooth, so you can put it anywhere and just send audio 
[00:23:30]  right from your phone or your iPad to anywhere it's located in the house.  You gotta be hooked up to your Wi-Fi, right?  No, it's just Bluetooth.  Bluetooth.  And then, so give me an example of how you'd use this.  I was streaming podcasts right to it over the weekend.  So it's anything on your phone?  Anything on your phone.  I can, too.  Anything that has a Bluetooth connection can go right to it.  No, you can also use it as a speakerphone.  Obviously.  Oh, yeah, I read that, too.  It's got a mic in it.  That would be kind of embarrassing, though, if you have that on and you get a phone call 
[00:24:00]  and you don't know and it's in another room and you're having some horrible conversation  with some girl that you shouldn't be having and your wife is hearing it.  Wouldn't that be awful?  That would be terrible.  Oh, Jesus.  Funny for her, though.  Absolutely.  So wait.  So you want to go out to dinner and then I'll pass out later?  I thought you only did that with me.  So the Jambox, is it louder?  Because Mac products have horrible speakers and they're never loud enough.  I watch the Sopranos on my fucking iPad and I literally can't even have the dryer going  because I'm like, what? 
[00:24:30]  What do you say?  What do you say?  What do you say?  So is the volume good on that?  The volume's great.  Okay.  Nice.  You can hear it.  You max it out on your phone and you can also max it out on the Jambox as well.  So you can blast that thing all through the entire house if you wanted to.  And that's the small one.  They make a bigger one with a heavier subwoofer on it.  So where is that now?  It looks like it's on a bed.  That's on the dining room table.  Oh, the table.  That's tablecloth.  Alrighty.  Look, he's all proudly displayed and set up for a picture for his website or Twitter 
[00:25:00]  or whatever the fuck he's putting it on.  I want to go to E-Rock's house.  Have you been there, Ant?  Never been to the Nagel of the States.  Have you?  Been there a couple of times.  You have?  A couple of times.  I've been invited.  I just haven't gone.  I haven't even invited.  Yes, you have.  How far is it from here?  E-Rock is not like me.  Time-wise.  Not that far.  It's like 10 minutes away from the Meadowlands.  Yeah, so...  That's far.  Roughly 20, 35 minutes.  It's far.  It's not bad, though.  If I could drive east or west, I'll drive east.  It's my house.  You know? 
[00:25:30]  If it was on the way, I would stop by a lot, E-Rock.  No, you wouldn't.  You're in the opposite direction.  I swear, why wouldn't I want to go over to E-Rock's house and drink some beverages?  Just to make it hurt more, knowing that it's only five minutes from my house, I'm still  not going to it.  No.  I would definitely go.  Are you planning a shindig or anything?  We're going to do a bunch this summer.  This summer?  A bunch.  Hopefully, we'll have the outdoor movie theater set.  Whoa.  That would be kind of cool.  Yeah.  I've heard about that one.  Do you have an outdoor movie theater? 
[00:26:00]  No.  I don't have an outdoor movie theater.  I'm amazed that Antroid doesn't.  I like the indoor one.  You know what?  Outdoor?  Eh.  I could always hang something up and fucking blast something onto the side of the house.  But to have the outdoor movie theater?  I don't know.  He doesn't need it.  He has a fucking...  Anthony has a Predator drone.  He doesn't need a fucking cool setup in fucking 1975.  Shag carpets and lava lamps.  I know.  E-Rock's got the same thing.  They fucking screened Burt Reynolds movies on Boogie Nights. 
[00:26:30]  Fucking Anthony's flying shorties.  So you're going to get an HD movie screen out there?  Yeah.  It's all in the projector.  I mean, the screen...  No, no pool.  Oh.  Are you going to get one?  No, I don't have enough property to do a pool.  No?  Buy the house next door.  It happened there.  Yeah.  House next door.  Yeah.  I mean, it was sold to E-Rock.  Well, that's...  And then what happened?  Then I guess you went out.  Were you all fidgety at dinner? 
[00:27:00]  Because you wanted to get home and play with your toys?  Were you fidgety?  Are we done?  Did you bring the handheld with you?  No.  Oh.  No, no, no.  I haven't played the Wii U yet.  Oh, man.  I need to get...  I ran out of those infrared cables.  Oh.  So I need to get one more so I can hook it up and keep it out of the living room.  Your, um...  It's the one for what?  The remote thingy?  The fucking...  The sound?  What?  What infrared cable?  E-Rock comment.  The infrared cable. 
[00:27:30]  When you don't want to have all your components and everything in the room that you're in,  you can put them in a closet or somewhere.  Okay.  You can wire an infrared cable through the wall and put it in front of the TV so you can  access everything you have.  Yeah, with one remote.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just need an extra cable for the Wii U.  And then we'll be all set to go.  Ah, those are great.  I have that in my bedroom.  I have all the components of the closet.  And the one little thing, it's stuck on the TV and you just ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, yeah.  You got that downstairs in the movie theater.  I got that downstairs in the movie theater.  I got it upstairs in my fucking living room.  You and Eric can talk.  I can't relate to this.  I got it everywhere. 
[00:28:00]  It's amazing.  I have a switcher.  Oh, yeah?  If I want to use the PlayStation, I just have to reach behind the TV and flip.  A mechanical switch.  Yeah.  That actually has to be pushed.  And then you put it.  Amazing.  And then if I want to go to the Apple TV, flip.  I ran out of space.  So if I want to watch Apple TV, I unplug the PlayStation.  So you got to unplug the HDMI and then plug that in.  My TV is so old that it only has two HDMI.  Well, why don't you get a component receiver?  Yeah, I got one of those. 
[00:28:30]  I used them all up.  You used them all up?  Oh, yeah, because we got the Xbox and the, you know.  Xbox and what?  Xbox, PlayStation, Home Theater.  Blu-ray.  Blu-ray.  Who's he?  He needed the money!  I can't have infrared.  Oh, man.  He rock.  He's a gadget meister.  Yeah.  I would be disappointed if I was your wife for many things, but for the fact that you  didn't immediately start playing with your toys. 
[00:29:00]  No, yeah.  She was just bummed.  She got a game, too, that she wanted to play.  So we're going to...  What game did she want to play?  She got...  I Have a Husband That's Great.  Yeah.  A fantasy game.  Yeah, it's a weird one where, like, you talk to the husband and he says, I have to go out  and he gets a briefcase and goes to work and does adult things.  And you show him Ninja Turtle stuff and he goes, what is this, honey?  This is for the children.  Why is he a robot?  Yeah.  Well, it's the Wii graphic.  So let it be known. 
[00:29:30]  Jimmy's doing, like, a kind of robot move to simulate the Wii graphics.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's so weird that you push the button and the fantasy husband goes, no, thank you.  I've had enough.  Let's have some more sex.  Oh, E-Rod.  So what game did she want to play?  Yeah.  She got Just Dance 4.  Ah, boy, those girls love that dance, those dance-y games.  Is she a good dancer? 
[00:30:00]  She's all right.  Can you dance?  No.  You don't play it?  I will, but I'm just...  Oh, boy.  I don't dance.  Oh.  Do you have a...  Oh, well, you got Wii.  I was going to ask you.  Xbox Connect.  What's that?  I have Xbox Connect.  You do?  Yeah.  You have Xbox?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah?  Oh, fuck.  Xbox and a Wii U.  Holy shit.  I only have Xbox.  Nobody has two video game consoles.  Crazy.  Nobody...  I love that I have zero...  I have a PlayStation just for deep Blu-rays.  Yeah?  You're wasting it. 
[00:30:30]  I know.  I know.  I don't know what to do with it.  I've tried the fucking Grand Theft Auto.  Get a game.  I did.  I tried Grand Theft Auto.  I backed into the fence like a cunt for 40 minutes, and I'm like, goodbye.  I would watch that.  It's one of my favorite stories.  Dude, I would love to watch you play and just, fuck, back into a fence.  I literally kept back...  I was like Martini with the basketball.  You backed the car into the fence, Martini!  Remember I was telling you that they make that device now you can plug in so you can record  your video game experience?  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  We should hook that up for Jim.  That would be kind of good to get some audio.  See how he plays, hear his headset conversation. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to get one of those things, obviously.  Fucking yelling at five-year-olds on the Xbox.  Yeah.  Do they call you the N-word?  Yes.  Yeah, fucking...  People throw a nigger around on gaming.  I saw a show, actually, on the news.  They were commenting on how racist a lot of these people that play games are.  They play Modern Warfare and shit like that.  It's nothing but, like, fuck you, nigger, fucking cocksucker. 
[00:31:30]  It's amazing.  Like, what's going on out there?  Because it's so taboo, that's what you can say anonymously there.  It's like the internet at times.  People can say what they want without any penalty.  True, yeah.  Well, when you play at night, yeah, but if you're home during the day, if you ever throw  one of those games on between three to six in the afternoon, and you get all the kids  that just came home from school, just as bad, if not worse.  Yeah, yeah.  With the N-word.  They love it.  They love that word. 
[00:32:00]  There's a rumor that PlayStation 4, since it's going to be so connected to social networking,  is that you're going to be using your real name in online gaming.  Oh, boy.  So it might cut down on the racist stuff, because, you know, you're using your real name  and not just some fake...  Well, how come you can't just make a fake one?  Because everything's going to be connected to, like, your Facebook...  And your credit card.  And your credit card information, so it's all going to be, like, real names.  I don't like the sound of that.  Just like YouTube's trying to make you use your real name when you comment on stuff. 
[00:32:30]  I kind of like that, though, and I know a lot of people hate it.  Not for gaming.  I mean...  I don't know.  I can't think of a whole lot of circumstances where you don't kind of use your own...  If you want to comment as yourself, you should just be able to comment and say what  you want to say.  Sometimes, you know, society doesn't accept what you want to say.  And, you know, you'll be in Dutch, as they say.  Well, you've got to make a decision.  Well, you do.  Because I have to make the same decision every day.  Like, I want to say certain things I can't say, even though I talk for a living. 
[00:33:00]  So I make that decision.  You can say it.  Do I want to say it and fucking suffer the consequences?  But what if you want to say it, but you can't, not because it's wrong, but because there's  some kind of stigma that would be put on you for even voicing your...  You shouldn't be able to voice your opinion?  No, you should.  Of course you should.  But what is it that you would want to say?  I can't think of anything I would want to say that would get me in trouble.  Like, meaning, if I want to say something, I just say it.  Or I would write it, but I would never do it as anyone other than Jim Norton. 
[00:33:30]  I just wouldn't do it.  It would never occur to me to go on anonymously and do that.  Maybe you don't have any taboos you want to discuss in society.  I don't know.  I don't know.  There are certain things, especially racial discussions, where, you know, taken out of  context, a little clip here of Twitter posts that in print, in an article with your name  attached to it, it could be devastating to your career when all you meant to do was, you 
[00:34:00]  know, put out your opinion on something.  And meanwhile, it then gets twisted around and used out of context, and you wind up losing  your job or worse, you know?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It just seems to me some things with anonymity are fine.  Other things, obviously, if you're going to critique somebody or bash somebody or be  what they call a hater with an eight, you know, then you should, you know, man up and put  your name in there.  But there are certain things that society has dictated that you will be fucked if you 
[00:34:30]  say it.  So, you've still got to kind of remain in the shadows.  No, I don't.  I agree.  Even though you're probably right, I still think people shouldn't remain in the shadows.  I don't think that they should.  I really don't.  Because I don't think, like, what can't, like, you want to comment on race.  Yeah.  And you want to, you can comment on race.  But the problem is, I've never in my life read somebody being, like, really anonymous  who goes on and just says things like, you know, hey, I think that the problem between 
[00:35:00]  black people and white people, people who want to be anonymous just want to go on, he's  fucking bigger.  Like, they just want to say these fake internet tough guy things.  I don't see that anonymity being used for legitimate, in China, or North Korea, if  they had the, you know, that type of shit, sure.  But that's not what we're dealing with here.  And you don't know what it's like, dude.  They're just, people just dicks.  I do.  And I understand your point about that, just bashing and coming off like a fucking idiot.  But you can honestly have an intelligent discussion about sensitive topics like race and still 
[00:35:30]  be, look at that as a racist and taken out of context and whatnot.  If you start discussing, go on Twitter and start discussing things like the bell curve  and basic IQs from around the world and the disparity between certain races of people  on the world and the difference in intelligent levels.  You could fucking absolutely be crucified for that.  And it's obviously a viable conversation. 
[00:36:00]  I mean, it's not like you're bashing your, your, your, your, uh, quoting, um, text, you  know, uh, studies, you know, and then people can say that's all horse shit.  I understand, but that should be allowed to have that dialogue with your real name and  whatnot, but you'd never can because they will take some of the fucking things that  you wrote, twist it around and, uh, you know, send it to your boss or something.  Then the bigger problem is that us, we are the, well, then we kind of deserve that.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Because we're all, we're all, it's not like there's an anonymous day, like an almighty  day.  It's us.  Oh, the us is worse than the day.  We're fucking terrible.  The us has become so much worse than they.  No one sticks up for each other.  You know, you're right.  You know, people at the first thing, some, when something happens, what, when something  happens on the sidewalk, a fight or an accident, you just see people's hands go up  with their phones to, to put it online, be the first one to get it online instead of  helping or, you know, trying to figure out what the best thing to do would be. 
[00:37:00]  All we want to do is catch each other making mistakes and crucify each other for making  mistakes.  Yes.  And then we want to protect ourselves when we go on and have discussions.  So that's why that annoys me because the people, the people who are anonymous are the  same group that are happy to write anonymous complaints and I want this one to get in trouble,  but I'm going to use the anonymity to protect myself too.  You're right.  It's just, it's just a fucking, it's fucking sneaking around.  Nobody's saying what they mean or be, there's ways to have even a bell curve discussion. 
[00:37:30]  I know it's very unpopular with a lot of people, but there's ways to have that without  fucking losing your whatever.  That's true.  I, I, I've had some great discussions, but you know, if taken, like I said, at a contest,  there's that anonymous fucking email that gets sent to someone's boss or someone's wife  or something, you know, there's, there's plenty of ways you could just anonymously send shit  like that.  Um, yeah, it's just, we're in a weird place, man.  Yeah.  The big brother thing is, is really interesting. 
[00:38:00]  I've, I've talked about this in the past where, um, everybody had this thought that 1984 and  a big brother was going to be government cameras everywhere watching us.  And then the government was going to use it for some fucking like diabolical thing to  screw us over.  And then it, as it turns out, we're the guys, like all the people with the fucking cameras  and their nosy, busy body look into everyone's life on Twitter and everything.  We have become the big brother part of, of what we thought it was going to be.  Thought it was going to be the government, very diabolical, very, um, harmful to your life. 
[00:38:30]  And then it just turns out to be some idiot with his phone catching you in a, a dumb moment  or, or out of context or whatever.  And, uh, they're the ones with the power to post it and fuck you over.  Well, you, it's like the tech, the people are so paranoid about the technology, like  they're going to run our lives.  Yeah.  The technology is helping balance power because people who are very powerful are, they're  just as vulnerable to dumb texts or dumb emails or pictures like Wiener pictures.  They're being brought down by it. 
[00:39:00]  Seeing that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're catching them doing shit and they can get away with less too.  Yeah.  Like look, look at fucking what happened in Egypt or what happened to, it almost happened  in Iran or all social media.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's balancing things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not this evil, the people are being made, you know, you're right.  We are fucking doing it.  We're doing it.  We're all becoming more powerful.  Yeah.  Which is even worse than just a select few.  Yeah.  Because at least a select few who are powerful kind of knew how to be motherfuckers and cunts 
[00:39:30]  and keep the system running.  Uh-huh.  All of us are rising up and like there's a lot of shitheads in all of us.  And they are, they are just as vulnerable.  Yeah.  They're just as vulnerable.  It was so odd to watch, I guess right after the Donald Trump, The Apprentice, you see  the celebrities tweeting and saying, oh, vote for me, vote for the, and it's like, God,  that's so cheap.  It's like, it cheapens your, even though their celebrities have been cheapened over the years, 
[00:40:00]  it just was odd to see people whose names you know, you've seen them on TV, you've seen  them on stage and stuff, like begging you for votes.  Pandering.  It just seemed like, ugh.  Yeah.  That's kind of cheapens everything.  But then you realize that's what social media is.  It's everybody just trying to be somebody.  Everything we do technologically is because we want to communicate more.  It's really, like with texting and fucking, you know, self, everything is just so we can  be more connected.  It's really weird. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, there is this need, so needy to just look, look, here I am.  I want to talk to five people at once.  The phone is not good anymore.  Here's me.  Because I can't talk to five people at once.  Yeah, I wasn't even on Twitter for most of the weekend.  Just like, you know, fucking doing other things.  And by last night, there was, every mention I had was, where are you?  Where have you been?  What?  Are you okay? 
[00:41:00]  You can't even, you can't even take a day of not doing it where people now don't notice.  They don't notice.  It's like, hey, you're fucking, where have you been?  Oh my God.  When do you sleep?  Check my timeline.  Look for the eight hour gaps.  That's what it's gotten to the point where, like, people can know when you're awake or  asleep based on your timeline in Twitter.  And you see, like, what you guys saw, when you saw those fucking cameras that follow you  everywhere, we're getting to a place where everybody will know everything about everybody 
[00:41:30]  else.  And it will completely level everything.  I don't know what Sam and Trash, everyone will know what everyone is doing in an instant.  Eventually, I'm telling you, thoughts are going to be, that's the next thing we'll go  through.  You had some racist or some sexist thoughts.  Oh, imagine that.  Eventually, because once we map that shit.  We've noticed that you've been thinking some very unpleasant things.  You go to, like, fucking the new, like, mental HR.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  You have to go down to MHR and fucking sit down.  Yeah, we noticed when you were sitting at about 1142, you thought something very sexist.  What?  Yes.  See, the whole place is wired where we can find out what you're thinking.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Well, then, what am I thinking right now?  But you'll know what they're thinking, too.  Really?  Yeah, we'll all be tapped into the same fucking thing.  Eventually, we'll all be.  I bet there'll be secret things.  You're not going to be able to know what the president thinks. 
[00:42:30]  That would be blocked.  But that eventually, yeah, we will.  Yeah.  Really?  I think all that stuff will balance out someday.  Oh, man, no way.  They don't even fucking allow the press in there now.  So, that's the sort of transparency I don't think we'll ever see.  That's where we're going.  Yeah?  Yeah, it'll be unavoidable.  I'm telling you, I really believe it.  I don't know.  That's the whole weird difference between the mechanical and the organic thing.  Like, our brain.  But it does throw up some kind of electro, electric waves, your thought process and stuff. 
[00:43:00]  But you think at some point that'll be able to be captured?  Without a doubt.  Of course it will.  God, that would be terrible.  It's mysterious to us.  Like, what makes your essence?  What makes you you?  Oh.  It's a fucking, there's an answer for it.  It's not this mystery, like, we call it the divine spark.  It's not.  There's something, there's a physical reason for it that they will capture.  I get petrified when I'm jacking off that, like, dead relatives are watching me.  Never mind fucking, people could read my mind.  Of course, if they're watching you, they're the focus of your thoughts at that moment.  Oh, Anthony's thinking of, oh, Jesus. 
[00:43:30]  Why is he?  Jesus Christ.  I think that's why whenever we think we see aliens, they're all silent.  When do we see aliens?  Yeah, that's a good point.  When do we?  Well, I guess our interpretation of aliens is they're just silent.  God, that would be so scary.  And they're kind of boring.  Yeah, they are.  Yeah, because I think that eventually these personality traits, which make us a certain  way and exciting, will get weeded out.  Because whatever need it serves to be funny, whatever need it serves to be this or that, 
[00:44:00]  we're going to genetically fix it so you don't need that shit, you just have it.  Very Vulcan-like.  Yeah.  Logical, without any real, you know.  I don't know, those never end well in movies.  When you take away, like, love and fucking compassion and fucking all those emotions,  it usually ends very poorly.  Like some couple finds each other and starts falling in love and having sex, and boy, do  they get it bad.  Oh, boy, the people in charge don't like that. 
[00:44:30]  It's where we're going.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What about entertainment?  Will there be a reason to watch something and go, ha-ha, I like that, or oh, that's  dramatic?  No, eventually not.  What?  What are we going to do?  Jimmy, I'm bored!  No, but I'm telling you, I think about this a lot, like, when you look at what a movie  is, or let's say we watch a movie, we're like, oh my God, look at Nicholson and that.  We're getting close within our lifetimes where you can just take anybody's image, and you'll  be able to just make whatever you want them to do in a film, because now you can image 
[00:45:00]  capture somebody, so if you image capture somebody, you can just create a film with  them.  The technology isn't there yet.  With your mind, maybe.  That's next.  Maybe you could just think of the movie you want in the scene and the actor and doing  it, and then you could just take the electronic impulses that makes that image and transfer  it onto an actual medium that then puts it into other people's heads, so they watch  the movie in their heads.  I think we'll look back at entertainment and films and go, wow, people had to do that? 
[00:45:30]  Future Jimmy scares me.  Why?  It's Future Jimmy.  Your image of society in the future is frightening.  And I know, and in the present Jimmy, technologically I'm a fucking boob, but I really do believe  this.  You know, Street View and Google Maps?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Future Jimmy is exactly what the plot of Fringe was, the TV show.  It was about the evolution of humans to the point where they removed emotion from the brain,  because that was just taking up space where we could be more intelligent, and they knew 
[00:46:00]  everything that was coming, and everyone could read everyone's thoughts, and that's  exactly what you're talking about.  See, and I really did not see Fringe.  I don't think emotion will be removed.  I think it will just be not needed.  Isn't it dangerous, though, Jimmy?  Because don't you think emotion gives us the ability to care for people and to treat  people nicely, know the difference from right and wrong, isn't there?  But, you see, needing to care for each other, I think that whatever, I'm not going to describe 
[00:46:30]  it well, but I know what I'm trying to say.  I think that the need to have that, I can't figure out how I want to say it.  A certain je ne sais quoi?  Yeah, I don't think that we will need to have that anymore.  Really?  Yeah, I don't think that that will be...  That's a fucking chimp thing.  Yeah.  Like, we're doing, you know, these...  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  These are still, like, fucking ape things.  Yeah.  These weird things to make us do something, or to make us... 
[00:47:00]  It is so odd, though, because I honestly think when you enjoy someone's company, and they  make you laugh, or you find somebody attractive, things like that are what keeps you from  choking them, or, you know, feeling bad if something happens to them.  Say we know how to map whatever it is that makes emotions and personalities, and we learn  to just remove the bad shit.  The things that cause...  At first, it'll be things that cause, like, fucking, you know, mental retardation, or...  Schizophrenia!  Schizophrenia, or whatever it is. 
[00:47:30]  Like, all these terrible things will be removed.  Mm-hmm.  So, then we'll just start to balance out a little bit, and then you start removing things  that cause anger and rage, because that's bad, and people won't be angry or rageful, and  then all these things will start to get removed that are bad, but a lot of the things, by  removing the bad, the good won't be needed, because the good is, a lot of times, there  just to counteract what's negative.  And then, eventually, you remove all emotion.  Yes.  Eventually, yeah, but you don't need it, because...  It's exactly like Fransky Schwarzman.  It's a dopamine release.  I mean, all that shit.  But, you know, did a funny description, and it's like, bites of chocolate, or whatever he called 
[00:48:00]  love, that's all, it's a dopamine release.  Yeah.  And it all, it's to further the species.  Once that shit is not necessary, then we'll start going through wormholes.  But, we're not gonna go out and explore the fucking Andromeda galaxy, going, God, I hope  my cunt wife isn't cheating on me!  You think that has to be done away with before we can, you know, do really cool shit like  that?  And I realize my description is very basic and stupid and fucking...  Yeah, it puts the point across.  But, I...  Like that.  I don't think that it's a bad thing.  We think it's a bad thing. 
[00:48:30]  Well, based on what we are now.  Well, look where we are now compared to where we were, say, 10,000 years ago, or whatever.  Where we're just fucking...  I mean, we're...  You know, a lot of what we did is we're not doing anymore.  But you're taking away our personality.  Exactly.  Because individuality, and I've said it...  Personal.  I love my individuality, but I think it's a primitive thing to need it.  It's a primitive thing to need individuality.  More of a collective.  Yeah, such a sad, bleak universe.  No!  I don't think...  It seems like it.  And we're all the same?  We don't have any personality?  We don't have any emotion?  We're just walking around?  What color is everybody?  That's important to me.  I don't think we'll need it. 
[00:49:00]  I don't think we'll...  Because we have to entertain ourselves and watch the new...  Look at this, watching the toddler cured of HIV.  Can you imagine if we all just knew that the second it happened or there was no need  for a cure?  You know, then you just gotta go out and figure things out and fucking beyond the planet.  Oh, that's so fucking...  I know.  Frightening.  I'm probably only 2% right.  If that, that would be still frightening.  Wow.  We fell right in there, going from E-Rock's birthday to fucking some cosmic stuff.  Sorry, I brought up the PlayStation.  We had enough of that. 
[00:49:30]  Enough of E-Rock's birthday already.  Oh, yeah.  You were talking about the people who have to be logged in.  But first, that last name would be kind of dangerous if you don't...  Yeah, that's true.  Just because if you're a kid playing, you don't want someone to know where they can find you.  Hey, where are you?  Yeah.  Hey, hey, Timothy Buttons.  I see you.  Yeah.  That goddamn baby.  They cured it, thank God.  They can't say I gave it nothing.  Yeah, the AIDS baby.  Well, let's take a break.  Let's have some grub. 
[00:50:00]  And we'll be back.  I want to talk about, of course, Dennis Rodman.  I'm going over to Korea.  His statements.  What a diplomat he is going over there.  It's great.  Secretary of State Dennis Rodman.  But I'm in the news.  And you know who sent him over?  Who's that?  Vice.com.  Oh, it was Vice.  Fuck, I've been watching them all weekend.  Amazing, right?  They sent him over to fucking North Korea.  Yeah, that's a fun story.  I got some clips of that.  It's outrageous.  He spoke with George Stephanopoulos.  And wow, he's out of his fucking mind.  Okay, we'll be right back. 
[00:50:30]  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  Sirius XM.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  He's so funny.  Sirius XM.  Calling in to your favorite radio show can be one of the funniest experiences there is.  Boys, how are you?  There's Joe Piscopo.  Joe Piscopo.  It's been so many years, sir.  You can get your point across and have a laugh with the boys.  How long have we known each other?  Since the Eisenhower era?  Yeah, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time. 
[00:51:00]  But sometimes, things can go horribly, horribly wrong.  Without the proper forethought, these dream calls become the stuff of nightmares.  Hey, Joe, you getting that young pussy now that you're single?  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I'm trying to keep it nice.  Yeah.  Of course.  Pleasant conversations turn to exercises in extreme humiliation on a national level.  And I wanted to plug, too.  It's Scottsdale.  Yes.  Tomorrow night, I'm at the Talking Stick Resort, which is going to be a plan. 
[00:51:30]  Only the good places for you, Joe.  Joe Piscopo.  And that includes Jersey.  Why the obsession with Jersey?  I think because I was brought up here and everybody's got that work ethic.  Because after the Sandy situation, we all joined together.  It's bad you didn't have a beach house.  A room full of silence can only lead to irrecoverable damage.  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[00:52:00]  So before you pick up that phone, remember, the next asshole could be you.  Hello, guys.  Hello there.  Come on now.  What?  Where are you?  I got you?  A message from your friends at the Opie and Anthony show.  What happened?  What happened?  Hello, hello, hello.  Coming up on an all-new O&A Behind the Laughter, comedian Jim Norton opens up about his private life. 
[00:52:30]  So I'm on my stomach, and I guess maybe a little goes in, and it's really hurting.  I'm like, yes, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And the work that goes into creating a great joke.  And I just have to keep stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  And she's like, just relax, you're tensing up.  And I'm like, of course I am.  Trying to fuck me in the butt.  How does a famous comedian hone his craft?  And she's getting annoyed at me.  She's like, just relax.  And I'm like, I'm trying to relax.  And then a little bit of it going, stop, stop, stop, stop.  I have to shit, I have to shit, I have to shit.  Jim Norton opens his heart. 
[00:53:00]  I'm gonna shit, I'm gonna shit, I'm gonna shit.  And his sphincter.  And then she stopped and I ran into the bathroom because I had farts.  And we all know, farts equal funny.  And I fucking push out like.  Hysterical laughter and soiled bedsheets.  I kept saying, how much is it?  And she's like, that much?  When we go behind the laughter with comedian Jim Norton.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:53:30]  Ooh, old school.  I wasn't a fan of this.  What's the name of this?  Butthole Surfers.  Right.  Pepper.  We weren't really able to make that post-90s transition.  The old butthole surfers, huh?  Not quite. 
[00:54:00]  It seemed like it was easier for a 90s band to transition to 2000 than it was for 80s bands  to transition to a 90s.  And then the 80s bands all come back and fucking, you know, do their little thing in the 2000s.  Remember Loverboy?  I heard them on the after show.  Right.  They're still big.  Yeah.  Huge.  Were they playing Fox News that day or something?  Yeah, we were just like, hey!  I can't wait until summer.  So we get the summer music festival Fox News thing every morning. 
[00:54:30]  See what fucking hacks that everyone's forgotten that's out there.  That they never let play.  Right.  They show like five minutes and then go to commercial.  Bumper music.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  America's Barbecue.  America's Barbecue.  Boy, they sure love that America angle over there at Fox, don't they?  There's nobody out there, though.  Today's show is a block away.  Yeah.  And they have thousands of people.  They have their big summer concert series out there.  And, yeah, they get the big stars, the teen heartthrobs. 
[00:55:00]  And then Fox News throws some country singer from 1985 out there.  Yeah, because Fox is appealing to people in their 40s who are on their way to work.  They're not going to stand out there and fucking just to watch like, whoo!  That's true.  Lover boy.  They're hard to shake your fist in the air when you're like, looking at your wristwatch.  Oh, I'm late.  I got to be to work.  Yeah.  Little kids are over there at the TV show watching Justin Bieber.  What happened to Bieber's birthday?  Worst birthday ever.  Worst birthday ever.  He was tweeting.  Why?  Um, he was tweeting like that, one tweet was, I'm so excited, birthday, yeah, this is 
[00:55:30]  going to be fun.  And the next tweet was hours later, worst birthday ever.  I know why.  And then there were so many people that tweeted like, all these little bitches tweeting like,  Justin, it's okay.  I hope it gets better for you and your birthday.  Don't worry about it.  He had a great, sorry.  No, no, they're just dolts.  Was that his birthday outfit in England? 
[00:56:00]  Oh, hat.  With the yellow hat.  The yellow hat.  And that was a really cool outfit.  Did you see that, Ant?  No, I missed that one.  Did you show Ant before, before, before, before Sam explains why, I want Ant to see the,  because Bieber had a cool look.  Did he?  Yeah, man.  Did he have a cool look?  Absolutely.  Where is that?  Oh, no.  Come on.  Justin Bieber, England.  Handsome.  Google Justin Bieber, cute.  Oh, no.  What is that?  Stop.  Stop it.  Yeah, it's a new, like, a hip-hop spiked hat.  It's a big, yellow hat.  Did you see the rest of the outfit, though?  You gotta get the whole outfit. 
[00:56:30]  Get him walking out.  He was really cute.  There you go.  What the fuck is he?  He's homeboy, man.  You don't get his shit.  What a fuck.  That hat is really big.  It's like a yellow bobby hat.  That's terrible.  And it's got, it's bedazzled.  It's bedazzled with spikes.  What is, all right, whatever.  Those pajama pants?  Yeah, he's wearing Joey Buttafuoco pants.  They look like those tiger stripe pants from the 90s.  Yeah.  Looks like me doing stand-up and fucking spotswood pants. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, well.  Yeah, worst birthday ever, he tweeted.  Yeah, he was upset that E-Rock took all his attention away.  Was that it?  Yeah, everybody on Twitter.  He didn't get a Wii U.  Everybody on Twitter was going nuts for E-Rock's birthday, and they forgot about poor JB.  They just wrapped his gifts in, like, regular wrapping paper.  Yeah.  The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle paper.  Or, aw, I guess paparazzi is what fucked him up, right?  No?  No.  I'm guessing he wanted to have a big birthday party. 
[00:57:30]  The paparazzi guy.  Here's his tweets.  Gonna be fun tonight.  Thanks, everyone, for all the birthday wishes.  19, exclamation point.  Then, big night ahead.  Oh.  And then, worst birthday.  Worst birthday.  How could Justin Bieber's birthday be worst birthday, by the way?  Sam, you want to explain?  No, I don't know.  Oh, okay, I know.  You know what happened?  Yeah.  Well, I'm a guy in the know.  Dish!  Dish!  I guess, yeah.  Were you invited to the party?  Is that what happened?  Travis does everybody.  Travis, he's a regular socialite. 
[00:58:00]  I guess wherever he was having his party, there were some problems with some underage guests  getting in.  And what's Will Smith's kids?  Jaden.  Jaden wanted to come, and she's like 14.  Jaden's a boy.  Jaden?  Okay.  He's 14.  Someone in the know.  Sorry.  Believe me, I've made the similar mistakes.  Oh, shit.  And the security wouldn't let him in, and so Bieber decided to just leave because a lot 
[00:58:30]  of his guests were under 18 and couldn't get in, so he just left, and worst birthday.  Why did he decide to have a birthday party at a place that he knew wouldn't let people under  18 in?  Because he's Justin Bieber, and he thinks that he can do whatever he wants.  He's not above the law.  I don't know.  Hang on.  Yeah, I mean, that would be annoying, though.  Well, you'd think it would be.  But you should hold it somewhere where 14-year-olds can get in.  Yeah, you can't have it at the club, then.  Yeah, there's places for that.  Go to Chuck E. Cheese's.  Or Herbert's House.  Is he in London?  Is that where he was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was at a Cirque du Soleil nightclub? 
[00:59:00]  Circus-themed 19th birthday celebration went awry Friday night in London.  The Biebs took to Instagramming on Sunday, bashing Cirque du Soleil nightclub for shutting  down his celebration early.  Hmm.  More details from Justin Bieber's worst birthday.  Ooh.  Funny moment when people believe I brought underage people in the club.  You think Will is letting his 14-year-old in a club?  I don't think so. 
[00:59:30]  Second, I love how the club wanted to give the press another reason to why we don't stay  at their weak-ass club.  Wow.  So they wouldn't look bad for me walking in and right back out.  Bieber wrote in a caption next to the black box,  I said worst birthday, but that was due to dummies pushing over my fans and being overly  aggressive.  By the way, it wasn't the worst birthday, because all my friends from back home flew in.  I was just mad in the moment. 
[01:00:00]  He was just mad in the moment.  Worst birthday.  So he didn't like the way his fans would be intrigued.  He liked the fact that these fucking, probably these dumb guerrilla guards were fucking,  were probably being mean to his fans.  I hate that shit, too.  Ooh.  Yeah, Bieber's birthday bash went sour after members of his entourage got into an apparent  confrontation with the club's security, prompting his entire party to leave.  Security thought some members of the Superstar Singer's crew looked rather young when they  arrived at the club and were refused entrance because of their age after they were asked  to show their IDs.  Ah, boy.  You'd think you would check beforehand. 
[01:00:30]  The club spokesperson says we operate a strict age policy.  I guess you have to, you fucking get shut down because one of Bieber's little friends.  Sure, you're still running a business.  You're fucking, yeah, little fucking 15-year-old, passed out, drunk, puking on the floor.  Sure.  Right.  Yeah, so worst birthday ever.  They should change the drinking age.  To what, Uncle Paul?  Four!  Four.  Years?  Four?  Yeah.  You're nice and mature by then.  Something tells me a four-year-old and a drunk four-year-old act exactly the same. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Just stumbling around and babbling, yeah.  No, one of them sleeps better.  They don't quite wake up from pain.  Well, Dennis Rodman, of course, our ambassador to North Korea.  How many people actually go over there from the United States and chat, especially anyone  of any note, you know?  There's ways to get in there.  One of Jonathan's friends went, and they do something. 
[01:01:30]  It's like 100,000 people.  I forget what it's called.  It's a display they do where it's kind of a...  What is it called when a bunch of people are in the stands of a football game, and they  all flip the card over to say the same thing?  Oh, right.  I've seen that.  Like, you know, yellow, blue, whatever it is.  They do a display like this.  That's amazing.  In North Korea, it's one of the greatest things humanity has ever figured out.  It's great, because that's what you get when, if you make a mistake, you're fucking beaten 
[01:02:00]  and tortured.  If that card doesn't flip over at the right time, get the person in seat of 90 seats of  air.  And then they just fucking ravage him on the field.  Have you seen it?  Yeah, it's great.  It's fucking amazing what they do.  I don't know what it's called.  What do I say?  Look for North Korea.  Give me a search keyword.  North Korea.  Card flip.  Card flip.  Display.  Just card flip.  Yeah, or...  Oh, card flipping.  There you go.  See?  Oh, you don't know how to Google.  No, I'm trying to pick a good one.  Any of them, I guess. 
[01:02:30]  100,000 people they get for this.  In the state.  But, like, because there's nothing else to do or watch there.  That's it.  Poor fuckers.  You're right.  Even those people, like, they've been so oppressed for so long.  I don't even think they know what to do with freedom and choice and things like that.  Some people just can't deal with it.  It seems like a boring existence.  Yes.  Boring.  Everywhere you go, you're escorted by guards.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's 100,000 people in the back there. 
[01:03:00]  Jesus.  You just gotta...  It looks like a big video screen.  Yeah, but it's all people.  It's people with different colored cards.  Just flip them up and make words in that wacky writing.  Yeah, and it's...  And then it's, like, people dancing on the field in various, uh, costumes.  What a fucking strange culture.  And it's about the history of North Korea.  Like, right now we're looking at just all these people in these weird costumes.  But it looks like a giant TV screen in the back.  And it's fucking people holding cards in seats. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, there's, um...  Are those some of the card people?  I don't know if they're the card people or if they're watching.  I think they're just watching with their approved haircuts.  You know what he...  Oh, did you see the flip?  Yeah.  They're fucking...  It's amazing.  They're, uh...  It's so odd that...  It's very hard to get a dialogue going with people that we really don't understand their culture.  It really is.  Like, this is so odd that we don't even care if they want to kill us and we want to kill them or anything.  It's so much easier to destroy people that you just don't have any clue what the fuck their life is about. 
[01:04:00]  It's like a big college football game.  That's all it is.  Eh, yeah.  But there's something very devious behind it.  Well, thank goodness we have ambassadors now.  Like Dennis Rodman, who went over there and actually hung out with Kim Jong-un.  They watched some basketball.  Apparently, Kim Jong-un is a very big fan of the basketball.  And the Bulls, for some reason.  Really?  They're fans.  Him and Kim Jong-il, I guess, fans of the Bulls.  Oh, probably because he preps them many times. 
[01:04:30]  A little shorty.  Yeah, big basketball fan.  Bulls fan.  And then Dennis Rodman goes over there.  I guess Vice sent him?  Vice arranged it.  I don't know how they pulled it off.  Amazing.  Yeah, I can't fucking believe they got him in.  Yeah.  And obviously out, too.  There's a story of some filmmakers that Kim Jong-il liked.  They were Chinese or they were South Korean or whatever.  For some reason, they went there and he kidnapped them.  They were like a husband and wife team.  And he just made them make movies in that country. 
[01:05:00]  Holy shit.  Make movies for me.  I wish I knew the story.  Can you see kidnapped filmmakers for North Korea?  Wow.  That's fucking crazy.  But there's nothing you're going to do.  No.  Because any country is not going to go to war to get one citizen out.  You want to go to war?  Yeah.  You see Obama banging down the phone doing coke off the table.  I've got to get organized.  Hangs up the phone.  Him and his wife?  Yes. 
[01:05:30]  That was his idea of getting organized.  That's right.  Exactly.  I've got to get organized.  And he hangs up the phone.  50 Colombians coming with machine guns.  And you're fucking straightening up the phone.  And the picture might be crooked.  Yeah.  I've got to get organized.  What's it say about them?  This is a long piece.  Because I guess he eventually wrote a memoir.  Which is probably really interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Him and his wife were filmmakers.  filmmakers.  Huh.  And he kidnapped them to just have them make movies.  Did they go there for some reason? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I'm going to have to read that.  It would be so funny if Dennis Rodman got kidnapped.  Oh, no one care.  He found out because he was supposed to do Celebrity Apprentice Press or something.  He's just fucking owning their basketball team.  Well, that's the risk.  He's out there.  Go ahead and play.  I want you to play for me now every day.  That's the risk you take when you go there.  Chances are it's not going to happen.  Okay.  But this is a dictator.  How great would it be if we went to war to save Dennis Rodman?  It turns nuclear.  Yeah.  Like, everyone had this concept of what would cause a worldwide nuclear war.  And it's Dennis Rodman. 
[01:06:30]  It's the worm.  The worm did it.  Do you want the story?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, his ex-wife was kidnapped from Hong Kong to North Korea.  Hong Kong?  Do you know, I heard something about Hong Kong.  One time, King Kong went to Hong Kong to play ping pong, apparently using his ding dong.  I heard that.  That wasn't true, though.  What happened was King Kong got hung up in customs.  Oh.  All right.  Here's what I figured.  If one guy bombs, I should jump right in with him. 
[01:07:00]  Thanks for the company.  You're welcome.  It just looks really lonely down there.  Hey.  So, his ex-wife was an actress.  This guy's name is Shin Sang-oke.  Okay?  Yeah.  He needs work on his vocals.  So, she was kidnapped from Hong Kong to North Korea.  Shin traveled to Hong Kong to investigate, and he was kidnapped as well.  The kidnappings were on the orders of future leader Kim Jong-il, who wanted to establish 
[01:07:30]  a film industry for his country to sway international opinion regarding the views of the workers.  That's how you do it.  Yeah.  So, North Korean authorities denied kidnapping him.  Claiming that he came to the country willingly, of course.  Ah.  And how are they going to prove it?  You know, it's like, willingly.  You're not going to give a non-state approved interview.  He was put in comfortable accommodations, but after an escape attempt, because, you know,  he was there willingly.  Yeah.  He was placed in prison.  Oops.  He was brought to...  She stayed in his gilded cage. 
[01:08:00]  In 83, he learned why he had been brought to North Korea.  That was five years after he had been kidnapped.  They didn't tell him?  Yeah.  His ex-wife was brought to the same dinner party, where she first learned that her ex-husband  was actually in North Korea.  Wow.  So, they remarried shortly afterwards, as suggested by Kim Jong-il.  From 83, Shin directed seven films with Kim Jong-il, acting as an executive producer.  Yes.  Do you know how fucking frustrating his notes must have been?  Oh, man.  Well, in the love scene, it should be the leader. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  True, the leader.  Good point.  All right, yeah.  Are you taking notes from that fucking idiot?  Fantastic leader is the main love interest in the movie again.  Yes, the star should be short and homely and have poor eyesight.  I heard you.  The best known of these films is a giant monster film similar to Godzilla.  In 86, eight years after his kidnapping, Shin and his wife escaped while in Vienna for  a film festival.  He kidnapped a filmmaker that makes Godzilla-type movies?  Yeah, pretty much.  But he let him go to Vienna for a film festival? 
[01:09:00]  I guess.  They managed to seek political asylum in the United States Embassy before they were found  out.  Kim Jong-il became convinced that the couple had been kidnapped by the Americans.  Oh, see?  How do you fucking let them go to Vienna?  Like, how delusional are you to their loyalty?  That's being delusional.  That's being delusional.  There's a story of a woman named Colleen Stan who was kidnapped by a couple, a married  couple in California while she was hitchhiking.  And they held her captive for seven years, made her a sexual slave. 
[01:09:30]  It's a very claustrophobic story where they would put her in a coffin-like contraption  under their bed.  Oh, I heard about this.  And there was times where she had to sleep with like a fucking head box on.  Like, I read it like I was crawling out of my skin.  Yeah, the head box.  And she eventually escaped years later because they had her believe that it was this white  slavery thing.  But they let her, they eventually, at one point they let her go see her family.  See her family.  And then she came back because she was so brainwashed.  She believed that there was a white slavery ring and her family would be killed. 
[01:10:00]  She told you to have to fill out that contract too.  A slave contract.  A slave contract that she had to fill out.  And they were, yeah, they threatened her, her family and whatnot.  It's just weird.  Perfect victim, I think the book is called.  How people can just buy that shit.  But she was so brainwashed and eventually they, like, they went away one time and they  left her in the fucking coffin and it was so hot that she actually kicked through and  broke out but stayed there.  What an idiot!  But I don't comprehend either.  Just wanted to get out of the coffin.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Well, they were eventually letting her stay in the bathroom handcuffed.  Yeah.  And then one of their kids saw it so it was right back in the coffin for a couple years.  Something called the Helsinki Syndrome, I believe.  Yeah.  I have no idea what it's called.  Oh.  Stockholm.  Well, Stockholm, yeah, I know.  Stockholm.  You can empathize with your kidnappers.  Yeah, I was just blind from Die Hard.  The guy in the news mentions the wrong country.  Stockholm, damn it.  Yes, I know.  The husband got greedy and wanted more slaves so the wife just couldn't, didn't want to  deal with that and fucking told the girl, like, you can, and then she escaped and whatever. 
[01:11:00]  But that's what happened, I guess, like, they kind of figured that these two wouldn't  go.  Wow.  How did I just ruin the whole show?  I'm sorry.  No, no.  I love shit like that.  I'm reading about it.  Oh.  Now, of course, Dennis Rodman goes over there.  Um, as a representative of the United States.  Why can't you say that with a straight face?  Because it, I saw the clips.  He's fucking retarded.  Now, do you want to play the clips that Sam has pulled or do you just want to watch the 
[01:11:30]  video?  Well, let's, um, let's watch some of the video.  Okay.  I want to, I want to get, like, the full impact of what his dumb face looks like.  Of course, he's got the piercing in the middle of his lower lip.  He's got a piercing in each nostril.  Uh, his tats all over, of course.  And, um, yeah.  And George Stephanopoulos is here.  And he's talking to the one guy in America who's had, you know, like, interactions with  this dictator that everybody...  Had to sit down.  And he has to sit there and ignore the fact that he's a fucking... 
[01:12:00]  That he's retarded.  Yeah.  That he's an idiot.  He's actually interviewing him as he would a politician, a diplomat.  You know how much they wish this was Abdul-Jabbar or Jordan or any player but him?  Well, yeah, I've noticed, um, he, he is a bit unstable.  Um, he, there are certain commonalities, like basketball, that, um, uh, we share with...  That would be, like, what you would want to hear.  The United States would be happier if it was Muggsy Bogues that went over there. 
[01:12:30]  He ain't want no war.  Uh, yeah, play some of this.  It's, uh, great.  George Stephanopoulos.  Weirdest encounter.  Eagle in the age.  Top of the news in North Korea.  What language is that?  The first American to meet...  Louder.  Not John Carrier, even Jimmy Carter.  Nope.  It was Dennis Rodman, a.k.a. The Worm.  They watch basketball.  Kim is a big fan, but that was just the beginning.  Some ice skating, too.  An aquarium visit.  Then a long dinner and lots of drinks with one of the world's most mysterious and dangerous men. 
[01:13:00]  I love him.  I love the guys.  He's awesome.  He's awesome.  He was so honest.  That about a dickhead who presides over prison camps, allows millions to starve,  and it's threatened to destroy you.  This is what annoys me about, like Stephanopoulos.  Yeah.  How many fucking dictators have we been friends with?  Ah, very good.  Because they did things that we...  You're right.  Come on.  Stop it.  You're right.  That's why I don't like when we don't talk to these guys.  We had no problem with who was the guy that fucking ran Zaire Mobutu for all those years. 
[01:13:30]  Mobutu.  You know, because these guys give you access to the fucking mineral mines.  Uh-huh.  We have plenty of dog shit.  In the Middle East, we're fucking, you know, in bed with people that absolutely kill women  and homosexuals and China.  Yeah.  We're in bed with China.  And as far as their death camps and human rights policies go.  But again, you're right.  As long as there's something in it for us, then we could do business with them.  This fucking...  We were from Musharraf in fucking Pakistan, whose own people hated. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  But these phonies like the Stephanopoulos take this high road.  We shouldn't go talk to Kim Jong-un.  What the fuck has he done to America?  Well...  He might be a cunt.  Yeah.  But what has he done to us that's so terrible?  It's actually...  His father...  The extortion thing's pretty good.  How he threatens free countries with nuclear weapons and then says,  Well, I'll stop if you give us a bunch of money.  Hey, it's a great move.  Why shouldn't he do that? 
[01:14:30]  He sees us fucking handing over $250 million to Egypt or fucking money to the Syrian rebels.  Why the fuck shouldn't they get the money?  He keeps a constant loaded gun pointed at South Korea, which was one of our allies, of course.  Yeah, fuck them, too.  They're not even grateful for us.  Fuck them.  Fuck the South Koreans.  They want the troops out.  They're sick of the troops.  I think we should be out of there.  Fuck the DMZ.  It's not our problem.  Yeah.  I don't care if Kim Jong-un goes in and takes it.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't think he could at this point.  China's not going to back North Korea anymore.  You don't think?  No, that was a big thing, obviously, during the Korean War. 
[01:15:00]  The problem was in North Korea.  We could have fucking devastated them.  It was China.  Just came a fucking bunch of million screaming Chinese flying over the border.  But now, I absolutely think China is so entrenched in capitalism at this point that they look  more how it would affect their economy than how it would affect maybe a communist ally  like North Korea in this day and age.  I think they've got like a one-track mind where they know that their economy is going to be... 
[01:15:30]  Express to fucking riches.  That's what they're all about these days.  They're not the old 50s communist China anymore.  They are a powerhouse.  It's amazing.  More billionaires now in Asia than in the Americas.  Oh, really?  Yeah, fucked up.  So just this attitude.  He keeps death camps.  He does...  Who gives a fuck?  I like how all it takes is basketball and drinks for Dennis Rodman to just think you're  an awesome guy.  And an aquarium.  And an aquarium.  The aquarium must have been fun.  He's awesome.  I think Dennis Rodman just walking around with a balloon of a killer whale. 
[01:16:00]  Like, oh, this is fun.  Looking all silly.  Make him splash me.  Yeah, he splashes them all.  Yeah, but water gets on Kim Jong-un.  He has the fucking whale killed.  Yeah, but it's not even the whale doing it until there's a Korean guy in the water splashing  away from the great leader.  That's the great leader.  That's what they call him, the great leader.  That's great.  That is great.  A little more of Dennis Rodman.  Amazingly, Rodman now has more first-hand impressions of Kim than any other American. 
[01:16:30]  There is nobody at the CIA who could tell you more personally about Kim Jong-un than Dennis  Rodman.  And that in itself is scary.  And Dennis Rodman joins us right now.  I guess you don't find it scary.  No, it's not scary.  There's some amazing, man.  Wow, man.  You know what?  He's wearing a suit.  It was money printed on it.  It was a great experience, me and my, I call him my son, Elkin King.  We went there, man, and it wasn't supposed to be like that. 
[01:17:00]  It was supposed to be like him.  Just meet the guy and just have a good time.  And it turned into such an event.  And I have to ask you first, when you said you love Kim and think he's awesome, were you  aware of his threats to destroy the United States and his regime's horrendous record  on human rights?  But one thing about that, you know what?  I didn't look at all that right there.  I understand what he's doing.  I don't condone that.  Right.  I hate the fact that he's doing that.  But the fact of it is that, you know what?  That's a human being, though.  He let the scars down.  He did one thing to me with a friend. 
[01:17:30]  I didn't talk about that.  What country is Dennis Rodman from?  Could you pause this for a moment?  What country is he from?  Are you having a hard time understanding?  Well, I'm denoting an accent.  Where is he from?  In the United States of America.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  He sounds almost Asian in that.  Yeah, like he picked up the accent.  Figure out how many times he says one thing.  One thing.  This is his favorite thing.  Here's the thing.  Ah.  The one thing he did, though.  The one thing he did, though.  His friend.  He's from the country of Trenton, New Jersey. 
[01:18:00]  Oh.  I didn't know he was a Jersey guy.  He doesn't sound like he's from Jersey, but...  All right, so...  Oh, no.  He has a horrendous human rights record.  Oh, no.  Like the Chinese?  Why do you say that to fucking every secretary of state when they come back from China?  That is a great fucking point.  It really is.  Stupid Stephanopoulos.  Like, this, of course, is the wacky story.  You got crazy Dennis Rodman going over.  The first American to really sit down and talk to this guy.  And he comes back with these stories about what a great guy he is.  Because they just sat there and didn't talk about world events or anything. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Talk about basketball.  But the thing to do is to bash him like this.  Sure.  And bash Kim Jong-un, who is no better or worse than a lot of these motherfuckers that get  away with, literally, murder.  And these jealous cunts in the media, they can't believe that this lunatic got what they  couldn't get, no one else couldn't get.  Because, again, how about how many people has Mike Wallace gone and talked to?  He went and talked to the Ayatollah.  So don't fucking sit there.  Of rock and roll?  Yes.  It was really bizarre.  I just hate the way they're all of us. 
[01:19:00]  We know who Kim Jong-un is.  Stop prefacing, well, do you know that?  We know.  He does threaten the United States, but he threatens everybody.  He threatens Japan.  He likes to think of himself and his country as a powerhouse in the world.  A world leader.  And that nuclear weapons thing is a big one as far as a country's power in the world.  So he's trying to get that.  But then when we say you can't have it, he goes, all right, well, you got to give me  some of that money and then we'll cut back on our nuclear weapons program. 
[01:19:30]  He isn't going to do a fucking thing.  He's just talking shit.  He's like a loud kid that you have to give candy to to be quiet.  And again...  Candy, by the way, is billions of American dollars.  He sure is.  And he gobbles it up.  But, hey, look, the Russians threatened us with nuclear war for fucking 30 years.  They just didn't say it.  Why wasn't I told?  From fucking 1990 on.  According to, you know, most films in Hollywood, that's the big threat now.  It's nuclear secrets.  Well, that new movie about the White House being taken over?  Yes, yes. 
[01:20:00]  Olympus Down.  Thank you.  Whatever it is.  I guess the Koreans are the villain in that one.  The Koreans are the ones that take over the White House.  I don't know why.  What do you think the villain's going to be when it's released in Korea?  What they should be, which is the Arabs.  The damn Arabs.  You want more?  Yeah, please.  I love it.  Do you think you have a responsibility to ask him about it so that you don't be perceived  as sort of propping up his regime, his cult of personality?  In an environment, especially when your grandpa and your father... 
[01:20:30]  I'm sorry to keep doing this.  Again, would he be asking Angelina Jolie this if she went to the Congo and talked to  some dictator in the Congo?  Goodwill ambassadors.  It's not their job to go over there and fucking criticize the regime in a country where you  probably could not...  You could be held there if he wanted to.  Yeah.  So stop with this dumb shit.  Well, I think a lot of times the government doesn't want these goodwill ambassadors to  be used as propaganda for the leaders.  Of course they're going to treat Dennis Rodman well. 
[01:21:00]  Of course they're going to let him come back here and have these great stories about how  awesome Kim Jong-un is because it's propaganda.  It helps their cause in the long run.  So I can see why he's doing that, but...  Yeah, maybe not.  Yeah, I think that's the difference.  Coming back and telling everybody, that guy is awesome.  What a great guy.  He's amazing.  Loves the b-ball.  Loves the b-ball.  But how much of him being terrible is propaganda on our side?  Exactly. 
[01:21:30]  Like, how about, you know, these guys are made to...  And a lot of them are monsters.  But if you come back and he actually treated you well, so why shouldn't you just tell how it  was?  It's like, you see, we won't talk to the Iranians or Ahmadinejad, we're not going to talk to  him.  Why not?  We don't have to like him, but you got to sit down with him.  I guess when you assume that all you're going to get out of him is bullshit and propaganda  and lies, that there's no real need to give them the credibility of sitting down and talking  to them.  I don't know.  I'm just rambling. 
[01:22:00]  If we were consistent, I would agree with you.  Yeah.  If we were 100% consistent and we didn't all of a sudden become friendly with Gaddafi,  all of a sudden he was our buddy.  Oh, he's helping us.  He's helping us now.  It's fucking crazy.  You know, we wonder why everybody in the world's a twat and we can't make up our mind  who our friends are.  Yeah.  You're terrible.  All right, we'll give you this.  All right, come on over.  All right, you're our pal.  Now, one thing, the kid's only 28 years old.  You called them great leaders.  Do you really believe that? 
[01:22:30]  No, what I saw in that country, I saw in that country, and I saw people respect him and  his family, that's what I mean about that.  Aren't they forced to?  Aren't they forced to?  Well, I say no, because I think he's...  I say no.  He says a different view, because I sat with him for two days.  Oh, two days.  And he asked me to give Obama something to say and do one thing.  Oh, here's the message.  He wants Obama to do one thing.  Call him.  He wants a call from President Obama?  That's right. 
[01:23:00]  He told me that.  He said, if you can, Dennis, I don't want to do war.  I don't want to do war.  I don't want to do war.  Did you say, why don't you pick up the phone and call President Obama?  No, you know, it's a different story.  He said, why?  Because guess what?  Good God, John.  What is it good?  He's not his dad, not his grandpa.  He's 28 years old.  So you think he's different.  What did he tell you about America, and what did you learn about him?  Guess what?  The one thing I said to him, I said, we talked about, if you see the clips or whatever, he loves basketball. 
[01:23:30]  Now, I said the same thing I said, Obama loves basketball.  Let's start there.  Let's start there.  He says that.  He says that about sports.  Both of you guys love basketball so much.  So that's one tiny bit of common ground.  Did you get any sense from him?  What do you think of a cool bit?  You know what?  One little bit of tiny common ground.  That's what motivates people to want to fucking change their country.  It's usually that pop culture shit that gets the students rioting and crazy. 
[01:24:00]  It comes from, you know, if he would have said, oh, come on, Twitter.  Well, who's going to use Twitter?  That's what motivates people.  It's all this weird social enjoyment stuff.  And they're both fucking Bulls fans.  Yeah, apparently, ever since he took office, he's really promoted sports.  Because he's such a big fan of sports.  He wants a relationship with the United States.  He's not as far.  He's a younger guy.  He's a younger maniac.  Oh, he's 28.  He's so jealous of, like, South Korea, I bet.  Yeah.  He's probably like, North Korea, we best Korea.  Why no talk to us? 
[01:24:30]  I bet.  And now he's trying to get Dennis Rodman to go back and tell him, just call.  Just give him a call.  Do you see how he looked at the camera like he was talking to Obama?  Hey, Obama, just call the man.  Obama got the message.  Is Kim Jong-un there?  Leaves him a message?  Yeah.  Hi, it's President Obama.  Yeah, do you have 10-pound balls?  How do you walk?  All right.  Little prank calls from the President.  Prince Albert in a can?  You better let him out. 
[01:25:00]  Well, no, Dennis says, yes, I do.  I have Prince Albert on my cock.  I'm sure he does have a piercing.  Hey, Kim, is your refrigerator running?  No, no power here.  We broke.  Shit, you ruined my gag.  One thing I know is by him, he's very humble.  He's very humble, man.  Humble?  As a kid, he's very humble.  This fucking portrait of him 20 feet high on every building.  As a man, he's very strong, but guess what?  He don't want war. 
[01:25:30]  That's one thing he don't want.  He said in the past that he would destroy the United States.  Well, I just think that.  I think that's coming from his father.  I think as a young man here, he don't want anything.  What else does he know about the United States and President Obama from what you could tell?  What I could tell about him, he does one thing.  He loves power.  He loves control.  Control and power.  Of his dad and stuff like that.  But he's a great guy.  He's just a great guy.  We sit down and talk to him. 
[01:26:00]  Perception is perceiving how things go.  A great guy who puts 200,000 people in prison camps?  Well, you know what?  Guess what?  It's amazing how we do the same thing here.  We have prison camps here in the United States?  We have prison camps.  Guess what?  This is all politics, right?  And the one thing, he don't want to do that.  He don't want to do that.  But, you know what I do?  It's more like it.  I'm not like a diplomat.  I don't want to do that.  Really?  But it sounds like you're apologizing for him.  No, I'm not apologizing for him. 
[01:26:30]  I think the fact that, you know, he's a good guy to me.  Guess what?  He's my friend.  I don't condole what he does, but as far as a person to person, he's my friend.  Indy, you're my best friend.  This fucking Stephanopoulos is a smug cunt.  You're not liking this, are you?  Hating his guts.  He's a smug cunt.  A smug cunt.  No, but he...  That's what they put under his name.  Look, on NBC News.  He knows the situation and the benefit of Rodman going over there.  It's a door opening.  It's a door opening into a country. 
[01:27:00]  We have...  We obviously give a fuck.  We obviously want something or we wouldn't be on the DMZ.  We would not have fucking troops stationed there if there wasn't some concern about this guy.  So here's this fucking dumb pop icon who fucking walks in.  Pop culture guy, I mean.  Pop icon.  Oh, I'm in prison.  That guy, I'm a pop icon.  And he's the only contact we have with this.  And all this fucking smug douchebag is doing.  And he would never ask a fucking politician this shit. 
[01:27:30]  He would never ask a reporter this shit.  Well, so what did you say?  Well, obviously, though, a politician wouldn't be coming off with the answers that Dennis Rodman is either.  Well, I just think he's awesome.  Could you see a politician sitting down going, he was awesome.  I must say, awesome.  He's a good friend of mine.  And the reporter probably wouldn't assert that the United States also has prison camps.  I don't think he meant it like that.  I think what he said would do the same thing here.  There was something about the phoniness.  I'm sure the injustices that he perceives in our system, he probably was talking about that. 
[01:28:00]  And what we were talking about, obviously, he's a little too retarded to bring up the fact that we do business with plenty of dictators in countries that have imprisoned people on their political beliefs and whatnot.  So, yeah.  Exactly.  So don't, the one guy that gets in who Kim Jong-un is nice to, don't come back and just go, well, did you tell him he was a bad guy?  Did you question his human rights?  You little fucking jizz drinker.  Shut the fuck up.  You jealous little bitch.  Jizz drinker.  That makes me sick.  Hope he doesn't get that virus that Obie got. 
[01:28:30]  The smugness of Stephanopoulos is making me fucking physically.  Because, you know, this is just a basketball player that got in.  So just look at it for what it is.  It's a fucking, a stupid little olive branch.  It doesn't mean much.  But do you honestly think that if he didn't handle Rodman this way, that he wouldn't have taken a load of shit for just letting Rodman say that he's awesome and that he's a friend and, you know, whatever about the death camps or fucking prison camps. 
[01:29:00]  He would have been called out on the carpet as a journalist if he didn't say this.  Maybe he would have been.  Maybe what's annoying me about Stephanopoulos is it's a mirror to how fucking selective the outrage is over the behavior of other world leaders.  Yeah, and unfortunately, Rodman's too stupid to turn it back around and call him out on the fact that you don't, you never address diplomats in these horrid countries with horrid leaders about what they're doing with these people.  Yeah, but he probably thinks they're all awesome, too.  They might be awesome, man. 
[01:29:30]  Awesome.  You know what?  These guys, most of these leaders are charismatic people.  Yeah, exactly.  That's another thing.  You're right.  They have an ability to fucking captive.  And you realize you're talking to the leader of a country.  So all of them are a lot.  I'm sure if you meet Ahmadinejad or fucking, you know, if you met Saddam Hussein, all of them are probably very, very captivating men and seem awesome.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Rodman through history.  Hitler was awesome.  Me and Hitler sat down.  We watched a basketball game. 
[01:30:00]  He's my friend.  What about the killing of six million Jews?  Hey, you know, shit happens.  One thing.  One thing.  You know something?  We do that here.  President Roosevelt, call him.  Call Hitler.  Yeah, I mean, you know, we fucking, all right, whatever.  I was going to make the same point again, so I thought myself, my apologies to the audience.  You can deal with it.  Someone who, hypothetically, is a murderer, who's your friend, is still a murderer. 
[01:30:30]  Well, you know what I do, seriously, you know, I think, guess what?  Guess what?  What I did, what I did was history.  What's history, and guess what?  It's just like we do over here in America, right?  It's amazing that we have presidents over here do the same thing, right?  It's amazing that Bill Clinton could do one thing, have sex with his secretary, do one  thing, really get away with it.  It's still powerful.  He uses that?  How can you compare that to prison camps?  A prison camp do one thing.  We don't need to do one thing, object that. 
[01:31:00]  We don't need to do it, object that.  Guess what?  We do one thing.  One thing.  Like a friend to friend, right?  It's a friend to friend.  He's a friend to me, and that's about it.  So you're going to go back?  Yes, I am.  I'm going to go back and do one thing and find out more what's really going on.  Find out more.  Okay, next time you go back, you should bring this report from Human Rights Watch with  you and maybe ask some questions about that.  That might make an uncomfortable basketball game.  Thank you for coming on.  That might make an uncomfortable second half.  I hate this for fucking cocksucker.  Yo, yo, Kim Jong-un. 
[01:31:30]  And there's the half.  The half is done.  We'll be right back.  Yo, Kim Jong-un, what's this?  And they're just kind of sitting like, not looking at each other.  What the fuck?  Every time we look at the relationship we have with Saudi Arabia, you fucking cocks.  Cocksucker.  Exactly.  They fucking shop hands off in the middle of the town.  Women are put in jail.  They're raped.  They have rocks thrown at them.  Yes.  Shut the fuck up.  Because they caused it.  It's their fault.  Shut the fuck up.  Like, how much shit does Saudi Arabia own in this country? 
[01:32:00]  They probably own things that he's involved with.  You go into the fucking CEO of these companies, you go, do you know who bought us?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what's bothering me so much.  It is a hypocrisy.  It's a phony fucking, this fucking fraudulent high road.  My favorite part is Rodman saying he's going to go back and find out what's really going on.  I'm going to go back and find out what's really going on.  I broke dice with the man.  We watched some Bazibon.  Now I'm going to find out about the camps. 
[01:32:30]  Now he feels comfortable, you know, touching on that subject because he's already broken  the ice.  Well, I'm going to find out about the camps.  I'm going to find out about nuclear armaments.  He said no.  He said no.  He don't want war.  And we're going to watch a rom-com together.  One thing.  One thing.  One thing.  One thing.  One thing.  One thing.  He.  How does Kim Jong-un perceive him?  Like, he must have been like, what the retard?  That man is a stupid man.  You know who the dummy is?  Us for giving money to that country. 
[01:33:00]  We're fucking dumb motherfuckers for giving the money.  We fork it over so he stops his shenanigans.  Again.  What?  We're just bribing him to not get nukes?  Yeah.  Fuck us.  Exactly what we were doing.  You're right.  Just fucking nudges.  Yeah.  Mind you, if he fires one off, or if it looks like he's going to fire one off, you'll level  the shitty country.  They've been testing missiles out and missiles that could probably.  They're not going to hit California.  They're not hitting us.  What if they do get technology that could reach the west coast of the United States? 
[01:33:30]  They're not going to do it.  They're not going to do it.  They don't want to do war.  They're not going to.  But they're not going to.  The Russians didn't do it.  The Chinese didn't do it.  They had a lot more to lose than North Korea does.  Nobody wants their population wiped out.  Well, that's true.  And China doesn't want him firing a nuke at us.  That's true.  Nobody wants him firing a nuke at us.  Well, that's why when you had a completely insane leader like his father, there's no  reasoning with him.  But this guy, it does seem like there's a little more wiggle room. 
[01:34:00]  But there was reasoning with him, because he didn't do it.  There was reasoning with him.  Well, he didn't have the capability yet.  But all these guys, a lot of times, they're just saying what they know they need to say.  Hitler was a doer.  You know what I mean?  A doer?  But he was.  He just did shit.  And fucking Stalin.  These guys just did things.  They didn't fucking bark.  And then as soon as someone else said something, they back up.  That's how you know the difference between a true sociopath maniac and a guy just fucking  just talking shit.  Point well taken. 
[01:34:30]  We should be like Michael Madsen.  You're going to bark, little doggy, or you're going to bite.  You can bark all day, little dog.  Well, that's an interesting take on that.  I haven't seen any of the news talk shows in the morning addressing it quite like that,  Jimmy.  You throw a nice twist on these things.  Just driving me fucking...  Not even the questions he's asking.  Yeah.  It's the smugness.  It is.  Thinking he's just talking to this fucking lower life form.  Like, Stephanopoulos makes me physically ill.  Maybe you can bring this report to him next time. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, just like that fucking cunt boy attitude.  Whereas if it was Barbara Walters that went over and she just had a friendly meeting with  him just to break the ice, this jerk-off might mention this stuff, but he would never talk  to her in that condescending manner.  Well, what about when Jane Fonda came back from North Vietnam and said pretty much the  same thing, that their people are wonderful people, their leaders are awesome.  I don't think she used that word, but she sat down on an anti-aircraft... 
[01:35:30]  Absolutely.  ...emplacement.  But since we're not at war, does it make it any better that you're pretty much just  spreading propaganda about what a great guy is?  Much better.  Yeah?  Because aren't we still technically at war with North Korea?  Well, it's kind of a...  Yeah.  Was it the Armistice or whatever?  It was kind of a treaty, but not a...  There wasn't a complete secession of aggression or violence.  And Jane Fonda was denying that our soldiers were being tortured.  We had guys over there being tortured.  And she was giving propaganda that was contradicting what our tortured soldiers were saying. 
[01:36:00]  It was a big difference between actively being in a war where guys from Long Island are  being shipped over and fucking killed in a jungle to what's happening here.  It was a huge difference.  All right.  I think, you know?  I think she should have been shot for what she did.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you think that was like treasonous?  Believe me, many people thought so.  And a lot of people these days still fucking can't stand her because of it.  Yeah.  She did look good, though. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, does she look good?  Yeah.  Fuck her.  I got a picture and I got it signed.  Hi, Jane.  Love you on a golden pond.  Fucking worm I am.  Annoyed Jane.  What's the story of Bill Cosby?  What's he doing up there on CNN?  Civil rights.  Civil rights?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had that...  What was that in March?  Down there?  Selma?  That was a long time ago.  Oh, right.  That thing.  No, they had an anniversary of Bloody Sunday, they called it.  The march was down there in Alabama. 
[01:37:00]  Hey, Matt on Twitter.  50 years.  Forgive me for addressing one dummy on Twitter.  That's okay.  I love dummies.  Fuck us.  You voted for Obama.  I didn't vote for Obama, Matt.  What?  I'll accept your apology in a moment.  I did not vote for Barack Obama or anybody.  I did not vote.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, you didn't.  No, I didn't.  Well, you didn't vote against him either, though, Jimmy.  That's true.  No, I didn't.  Just didn't vote.  Exactly.  That implies everything that not voting implies. 
[01:37:30]  I happen to like Obama.  I really...  Yeah, man.  And it's...  I hate his tax policies.  I hate them as much as you do.  I hate the death tax.  But I don't know why there's something about him I really, really like.  I don't know.  I think a lot of people are kind of seeing more that he's just a perpetual campaigner at this point.  And he's not really doing good for the country.  We're still in a fucking economic downturn. 
[01:38:00]  And people are saying the only way to get back from it is through, like, consumer spending.  But no one's got money to spend.  And then after the payroll tax went up for everybody, and they're seeing less money in their check,  they're buying...  They're pretty much just buying what they need.  And not buying any of those, like, items that get the economy going.  And the, you know, all the little wheeze, little wee-use, and the fucking...  I'm helping the country. 
[01:38:30]  You are.  That's what you should say.  I can picture Iraq saying that as he's in the basement with a rope around a stool.  I'm helping.  I'm helping the country.  I don't mean that, Eric.  I don't want that to happen.  Of course not.  I'm just kidding.  Of course not.  I love Iraq.  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  His wife obviously does with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle wrapping paper.  Everything else.  We'll take a break.  Take a little break.  And we can make... 
[01:39:00]  Do a little man-to-man kissing, getting to know each other.  I'm going to go wee-wees.  Let's go look at each other's wee-wee.  No, I'm not going to read that.  I've got to go pee-pee.  I've got to go pee-pee.  Give me it.  All right.  Nice.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's all right.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Serious Mexico.

Man, I sound like a fucking lunatic.  You made some good points, though.  I did.  I did.  Motivational speaker.  That's what I should be.  Hi, everyone. 
[01:42:00]  I was just watching the news during that little break, and apparently they have not found that  poor fucker that fell in that hole.  No.  There was a big sinkhole.  It opened up under a house, and these things happen time to time.  A car will get swallowed in the road or something.  It's just this big, either from running water or something, there's this big void that opens  up in the ground, and then the top kind of caves in, and everything falls in.  But it's usually pretty manageable.  There have been some big ones that have swallowed up some buildings and things like that, but 
[01:42:30]  for the most part, no one gets hurt at these things, because they're so random.  But there was a guy, I guess he was in bed, and a sinkhole opened under his house.  Swallowed part of the house, and him, and his bed, and he was screaming, as would anybody.  And they can't find him.  They just never found him.  They're demolished in the house now, but this must be a big fucking sinkhole.  That's horrifying.  Right?  Because you didn't know that you weren't just killed instantly. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You might have slowly suffocated.  It must have been so deep.  Like, it just must have been being formed for quite a while.  Is that it?  No.  Oh, that's another sinkhole.  Fucking sinkholes.  What the hell is going on?  They're like monsters.  There's more than one.  I'm going to find it.  They're like monsters.  Well, without them, all the water would just pile up.  In the sink.  In the sink.  Yeah, they're knocking the house down.  But they said it was, what, 60 feet across?  Yeah.  Or something like that? 
[01:43:30]  But how deep?  I want to see 20 feet across and 60 feet deep.  Really?  Am I crazy or no?  But if it was 60 feet deep, they would just have to go down there and find him, right?  Uh, 20 foot wide.  There must have been a chasm underneath.  Like, I was just imagining him going down there like one of those Plinko chips from, what's  that?  From the Plinko game.  Tickling, clink, clink.  And just, like, keeps going further and further into the earth.  To the bowels of hell.  Yeah, more than 50 feet deep.  Wow.  That's like a five-story building.  How do you not find him, though? 
[01:44:00]  Because it's probably, I wonder if debris falls.  Three days after a sinkhole swallowed a man inside his Florida home, who began demolishing  the house.  Demolishing.  His home.  But authorities say they were unable to recover the body of the sinkhole victim, Jeff Bush.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to determine the whereabouts of Mr. Bush, Jeff Bush.  But he's in the hole.  Who's a gentleman that was consumed by the sinkhole. 
[01:44:30]  Consumed.  We've told the family that, and again, we've expressed our sincere condolences to them.  It all happened Thursday night.  Jeff's brother, Jeremy, recounted the terrifying moments.  My moments.  The moments is home.  So I ran to the bedroom.  Oh, boy.  I went to go open the door and run in.  My old lady turned the light on her, and I seen that there was no floor there.  Wow.  Wow.  Everything was gone.  My brother's bed.  My brother's dresser.  My brother's TV. 
[01:45:00]  And my brother was gone.  Oh, man.  In this big hole.  All I could see was barely, barely see his bed.  And I jumped in the hole to try and dig him out.  I got a shovel and just started trying to dig him out.  Whoa.  I thought I heard him screaming for my help.  I thought I heard him asking me for help.  So I tried and tried and tried digging him out. 
[01:45:30]  And I was screaming and screaming for him.  And I couldn't get him out.  I tried so hard.  I tried everything I could.  Well, that memory will go away in a month or two.  Don't worry about it.  No, no.  That won't stay with him forever and ever and ever.  I disagree.  Oh, you think so?  Yeah, it's going to be there for a while.  You think he's going to remember that fucking moment where his brother's begging for help  and he couldn't help him?  Holy shit.  Oh, that's pretty bad.  The top buddy's stuck underneath the house.  The house just fell through.  No, it didn't. 
[01:46:00]  Okay, and what happened to the house?  The bedroom floor just collapsed and my brother-in-law is in there.  He's underneath the house.  Jeremy and four others, including a two-year-old child.  All that was left were these riled up striped socks.  And they removed his ruby red shoes.  Thank the Lord for not taking my daughter and the rest of my family.  Thank you.  While sinkholes are not unusual in the state of Florida, workers say this one is unusually  deep, wide, and unstable. 
[01:46:30]  The demolition of the home could be completed as early as Monday.  Rescue efforts have ended, and officials say they do not expect to find the body of Jeff  Bush.  They don't expect to even find his body?  Nope.  What the fuck?  It's a hole.  He's in there somewhere.  It's not like the ocean.  Maybe it was like a sinkhole like in Star Wars, and it literally consumed him.  Oh, like the worms in there?  To eat on it and everything.  Yeah, you want to get people to keep digging?  There's got to be some plates, like the fucking Titanic.  We send boats to the middle of the ocean and 2,000 feet into the worst terrain on Earth. 
[01:47:00]  We can't go 60 feet to get some fucking guy out of the ocean.  That's a poor bastard.  Out of the dirt.  Out of his little fucking sinkhole.  He's gone.  That's fucked up.  Yeah, lost him.  No, it couldn't be helped.  He's gone, and there's nothing we could do about it.  Wow, that's fucking, that's kind of frightening.  Yes, it is.  You really got to feel bad for the brother.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  It's terrible.  We'll continue our terrible news segment right now. 
[01:47:30]  The terrible news segment.  Yeah, we're going to do terrible news.  Terrible news.  Terrible news.  Weird news.  News that's terrible.  Terrible news.  We're going to jump a new segment.  Sponsored by a bit of a bit of a bit.  Scorch.  This story is so fucked.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  21-year-old couple, right?  Oh.  21-year-old couple here.  A Hasidic Jews.  A hit-and-run crash.  They were on their way to the hospital because the wife thought she was having her baby at 
[01:48:00]  that moment.  Their first baby.  And the husband and wife were in a livery cab, which is one of these, you know, cabs for hire  kind of a thing.  Yeah.  Black car.  Town car.  Yes.  And they got broadsided.  Slammed.  T-boned.  By another vehicle.  Threw the wife and mother-to-be out of the vehicle.  Underneath a tractor trailer.  That was parked.  It was parked.  And the guy was pretty fucked up in there.  And he wound up dying on the way to the hospital.  Uh, the woman was, um, was dead. 
[01:48:30]  They brought her to the hospital and delivered the baby through C-section.  The baby's still alive.  Still alive.  Uh, doing well.  But, what I like.  You figure, they're very religious people.  Orthodox people.  Orthodox Jews.  And, um, boy.  That's what that gets you, huh?  Yep.  That's what that fucking, uh, committing your life to a religion.  Um, and then what happens?  It's terrible.  It's just, how does everybody in that community, because they are very religious. 
[01:49:00]  Yes.  Why do they always excuse God being a douche?  Because it's mysterious.  Like, he must have wanted them for something.  They make it very special when, uh, the Lord takes you like that.  Because, uh, he wanted you for something, I guess.  Well, then why do we punish each other for bad crimes?  Like, let's, like, why are we, why is murder a crime to religious people?  Hey, because we're not fucking God here.  No, but maybe God, we're instruments of God.  God, why is it that when we religious people think, when we do good things, I am but an  instrument of God. 
[01:49:30]  Ah.  How about people doing bad things?  God didn't like him, and he wanted them to get his fucking teeth knocked out with a  hammer.  That's a good defense.  He asked me to do it.  I wonder if that would hold up in court.  Probably not.  I bet.  But it wouldn't even hold up to religious people.  No, no, it wouldn't.  You're right.  That is hypocrisy.  Good shit's up to God.  Yeah.  God had me do this.  The bad stuff, well, you're in trouble.  The bad stuff, God's got to do really firsthand.  Yeah.  He can't, uh, he can't delegate the bad stuff.  Yeah.  Good stuff, delegate.  Bad stuff, no.  He's got to do it himself.  They didn't even, they haven't even called the guy who did it.  No, it was a hit and run. 
[01:50:00]  They know his name.  Yeah, the woman that owns the car lent the car to some guy, I guess.  So she's in trouble for lending the car to somebody that wasn't under the insurance  or something.  Do you think her insurance is going to go up?  No, probably not.  Does she have Geico?  It's no fault.  Yeah, no fault.  But the guy just took off running after he did that.  And I guess they know his name, so it won't be long.  Let me see, what would you do?  What would you do?  Religion has nothing to do with it.  No, you're right. 
[01:50:30]  Oh.  If, let's just say, let's say he was drunk.  If the guy was drunk or high, knowing that that's a mandatory prison, is he smart to  run away?  Because leaving the scene of an accident is not good, but you always have the excuse of,  I was just in shock and I panicked and didn't know what to do.  That's true.  What's the worst thing to get in trouble for?  I would say the drunk would be worse.  If you're drunk or on drugs.  And, yeah, that'd be worse.  That's an absolute, at least this one you could say, I was just, I freaked out. 
[01:51:00]  I didn't know what to do.  But they could also, you know, get a timeline of where he was, what he was doing, and kind  of.  Can't prove drunk driving.  You can't prove it, but you put enough, you put enough out there, somebody's going to  be like, eh, he was probably drunk, let's fuck him over.  Especially since the people died, like it's still vehicular homicide or whatever.  Yeah, he's got that manslaughter thing going for him.  But the baby lived, which is amazing.  She was hit with a force strong enough to throw her out of the vehicle and down the 
[01:51:30]  street under a tractor trailer.  And that fucking womb, that's an amazing place, right?  You're just in there fucking floating around.  And, uh, you get flung out of a vehicle and the baby's still okay.  But then again, but then some women will be fucking making eggs and they bump their stomach  on the fucking panhandle and they lose the baby.  There's no absolute with it.  No, there's no rhyme or reason to it.  I think they should make, um, make like wombs you could fucking just zip yourself into 
[01:52:00]  and drive around in that.  Yeah.  Seems to work pretty well.  Little arm holes.  Yeah, little arm holes.  You steer and you're fucking, hey, I'm fine.  Two people on the phone are saying that the baby died.  I mean, last I heard.  I heard the baby was alive.  The baby was in serious condition.  It was definitely delivered alive.  Oh, I didn't even hear serious condition.  Yesterday, they said it was in serious condition.  Tragic death.  This just happened.  Whoops.  Oh, well, it was born premature, too.  So maybe that was, um.  It was alive when it was born, though.  Yeah, I heard it was born normal. 
[01:52:30]  I didn't realize.  Oh, this young family will be buried together now.  All right, breaking news, the baby's dead.  Gee.  That's terrible.  Terrible.  What a horrible story.  And the papers, I mean, again, the papers can only do so much, but both of them say miracle.  Miracle baby.  Born an orphan.  Not quite a miracle, is it?  Wombsuit would still work, though.  Wombsuit.  You know?  The womb did protect the baby.  For a period of time.  That should have been the headline.  Wombsuit works.  Wombsuit works.  Wombsuit.  I want a wombsuit. 
[01:53:00]  Fucking depressing.  Yeah, that's terrible.  Terrible story.  Well, you know what?  Um, I wonder if, God, is that better or worse when the whole fucking family's dead?  Like the mother, the father, and the kid?  It's like, I mean, no one's left out.  You know, you imagine just the dad lives through it, and he's got to be told that his wife and  baby are fucking dead?  That's crazy.  Yeah.  I guess that was God's fucking great way of, that's his consolation prize.  Yeah, well, the father of the woman said that God is punishing him. 
[01:53:30]  For his sins by taking away his daughter.  Yeah, that's what God does.  That's how self-centered this guy is.  That he's making it about him.  That it's about you.  Jews aren't known much for their self-suffering and guilt in their religion, though.  That's the, hold on.  Let me correct you, Ant.  That's not true.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh.  But isn't that amazing?  Like what a self-centered, it's hard to criticize a guy's daughter's dead, but what a self-centered  thought that is.  Boy, he's going to be a guilty motherfucker, then.  It's just the self-obsession to think that your sins are so mighty. 
[01:54:00]  God finally got around to looking at you and going, oh, what have you been up to?  Yeah.  Well, well.  And what the fuck kind of sins has he been pulling if that's the retribution God chose  and not maybe I'll give you a flat tire on the BQE?  That's fucking some bad shit.  And that's his way of avoiding the actual fact, which is, wow, God is a fuck.  Or just.  God is a fuck.  Or life is just a random.  Random thing.  Selection of.  Yeah, no. 
[01:54:30]  God is just.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  His sins merited that punishment.  Yeah.  He must have been like fucking retarded young children or something.  That's a terrible, terrible payback.  Not just young children.  No.  Had to be the most innocent.  And why do all those people got to pay for that guy's sins?  Absolutely.  God damn it.  No, everybody's got to pay.  Yeah.  Well, there's other family members.  What about the husband?  What about the husband's family?  Yeah.  Now they've got to go, oh, thanks.  What have you been up to?  Yeah, way to go. 
[01:55:00]  Jesus.  It's fucking frightening.  It's frightening what people think.  Husband's family, I was probably saying like, no, we're good.  It's the other guy's sins.  We're in the clear on this one.  I haven't been doing anything.  I've been pretty good.  Yeah.  Fucking depressing.  I merit probably losing my car keys for 20 minutes.  That's my fucking bad thing that's going to happen because I really haven't been all  that bad.  Yeah.  But to wipe out an entire family.  Wow.  Yeah, because of this guy's sins.  Yeah, his sins.  I'm bad.  So I'm so important that God would kill other people because I'm bad. 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  Just a fucking...  I don't know what it's like to lose a kid, so...  Yeah, I'm sure you're trying to look for any reason besides, hey, it's just random.  Random and shit.  Yeah.  So I guess, you know, put it on yourself.  Yeah.  Make it seem like, you know, they didn't do anything.  It's frightening.  Um...  Yeah.  Now we'll just ponder that.  Just let that sink in a while. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, God.  It's so depressing.  Depressing news.  Depressing news.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding.  Depressing news.  Hey, depressing news segment.  The PFG TV.  PFG TV is sponsored by...  Hey, who's the car dealership we're talking about today?  Have you heard from Scorch at all?  Anything new on the Scorch front?  No, I know that somebody is...  Somebody posted a YouTube video.  Yeah.  And it's every time we've talked about Scorch.  It's just one long video.  It's like hours long.  Wow.  Which is just... 
[01:56:30]  I mean...  Do you know anybody that works with him still?  No, I only hear from his former sidekick, who I worked with, who he moved...  Yeah, the one that got angry because Scorch moved without telling him?  Yeah, because Scorch was...  Right now.  Oh, my bad.  Scorch was saying that, yeah, I'm going to send our tapes out.  Don't even worry about it, Pauly.  We got this.  You just stay there.  I'm sending our tapes out.  And then a day before he left, he's like, oh, by the way, tomorrow's our last show.  I'll move it to New Hampshire.  Have a good life.  And so, yeah.  But, I mean, I talked to him. 
[01:57:00]  And he listens.  He loves the Scorch segment.  Good luck to you.  Oh, I bet he does.  He's harboring some resentments.  Oh, I bet he loves him.  All right.  Oh, you can't.  I can't.  I'm just watching the latest.  I know.  Watch the big opener.  I guess...  Oh, Jillian Jacobs is coming in later.  Yeah, Jillian.  She's from Gillian.  Right, right.  We said Jillian, and then she corrected us.  Gillian.  Yeah, you thought called Gillian's Island.  Gilligan.  Oh.  Yes.  Was she on Community?  Community, yeah.  Isn't that going off the air?  No.  It was actually... 
[01:57:30]  What?  It was.  It looked like they were just trying to bury it,  because they said they were going to put it on on Fridays and da-da-da.  But then somewhere, NBC decided to change their mind,  and after they filmed all the episodes,  they decided to put them back in the Thursday night lineup.  But it's funny...  Ah!  Because they filmed all the episodes for air months ago on Fridays.  Right.  So, like, three weeks ago, they had their Halloween special.  Oh, that doesn't...  Yeah, that doesn't play well on a first-run show.  Right.  But, I mean, it's okay, because Community's a bizarre show. 
[01:58:00]  Anyway.  So it's like, you know, okay, Halloween special in February.  Yeah.  I'll take it.  I wonder if she'll badmouth fucking Chevy Chase.  I don't know.  He's off the show now.  I know.  What a douche that guy is.  Everyone just hates him.  Yeah, it's either him, or it's everyone who has ever met him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, no one really enjoys Chevy's company, working with him.  I'd love to get the creator of Community in here,  because I'm sure he would smash Chevy. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, he's had some...  Yeah, Dan Harmon, because Dan Harmon's the one who Chevy would leave the voicemails for.  Yes.  Chevy.  I do think Chevy Chase is really funny.  I think he used to be.  Yeah.  He used to be.  Now I can't watch him without knowing what a prick he is,  so it takes away from, like, any humor.  Yeah, like, when I watch Community now, I'm just watching the scenes,  and I'm going, all those people hate that guy.  Oh, they hate him.  All those people there hate that guy.  I'm sure once the old cut, and this funny scene is over,  he was just an asshole to everybody. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  I was watching fucking...  Someone said I should watch Portlandia,  because you should check it out.  Just watch Portlandia.  Just check it out, because it's kind of funny and everything.  I've heard mixed things.  Hipsters love Portlandia.  Love it.  I've never seen it.  I couldn't imagine a hipster that wouldn't love the shit out of this.  Sal loves.  He does?  Yes, he does.  I gave it a good shot.  There was a marathon on,  so I gave it a good three, four episode shot there. 
[01:59:30]  Well, you're just not cool enough.  No, let me tell you what it is about hipsters and comedy also.  You could watch that show,  and without laughing, with a complete straight, dumb hipster face,  go,  that's really funny.  That, um...  Yeah.  Oh, I could see how that is hysterical.  You're not laughing at it,  but you're going like,  all right, I could see why that would be funny.  It's very clever, what happened just then.  Very clever. 
[02:00:00]  But not one, like,  ha, ha, ha,  what is that anyway?  Ha, ha,  laugh,  the sound,  ha, ha, ha,  ha,  what is that anyway?  Laughing.  Because a lot,  and I've never seen Portlandia,  but a lot of hipsters,  it seems like,  are like,  Yes!  A lot of these guys,  and I'm generalizing,  are just boring guys.  Yes!  They're boring dudes,  and so they'll,  like,  they don't crack each other up.  No, no, no.  That's just it.  They think that that's lowbrow or whatever.  It's got to be so subtle,  and so strange and quirky, 
[02:00:30]  that you don't guffaw over it.  Because you look at it and go,  ah,  there's the funny part.  Thank you.  The idea that,  well,  it's overarchingly funny.  Yes.  Like,  the whole thing is funny.  It's not a funny thing.  It's not laugh out loud funny.  No,  it's just the entire,  reflecting back on the episode I just watched,  yes,  the entire thing was funny.  The entire thing.  But I never laughed.  I didn't get it.  Did you see the one where Eddie Vedder was in it?  No.  That was probably a really good one.  Was he in that one?  He was in an episode. 
[02:01:00]  He was in that episode?  That,  I'm sure,  is really good.  Yeah?  The rest of it,  I don't know.  So,  Chelsea's name popped up in there,  too,  in the credits.  Was she in it?  She wasn't in the episode.  That's weird.  Maybe she was in it in her scene get cut?  Sometimes if you're in something you're seeing,  it's cut.  Oh,  maybe.  It was like the Milk Advisory Board commercials they do.  You know,  which is another,  like,  hoot.  But I saw her name in the credits.  I'm like,  oh,  fuck.  She's doing it in there.  Yeah.  She's making contacts with everybody,  isn't she?  Well,  she wrote on Parks and Rec, 
[02:01:30]  talking about Chelsea Freddie,  and for,  I think,  a couple years,  and she's going to get something huge.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  She'll get something very good.  She's writing for a Kroll show now.  And then she's making a little Twitter relationship with the fucking T-Mobile girl.  She's got me like,  fuck,  I think they're going to hang out.  Are you jealous?  Yeah.  That's what's got you like,  man,  this chick is making contacts.  Jim's talking about all these big shows she's on.  You're like,  yeah,  and she's,  she's tweeting that T-Mobile girl.  She's tweeting the T-Mobile girl,  Carly Fulks.  And I don't like that at all. 
[02:02:00]  I want to hang out with Carly Fulks.  You do.  Yeah,  I think it would be fun.  But,  uh,  alas,  I am but another one of her Twitter followers,  and nothing more.  Not like Chelsea Freddie.  No,  they're talking about having play dates with their animals and stuff.  Yeah.  You gotta get some animals.  Maybe she reads my fucking late night drunken tweets,  and realizes I'm a fucking lunatic that shouldn't be dealt with.  Probably.  Yeah.  The T-Mobile girl can't be,  um,  linked up to a guy like me. 
[02:02:30]  She'll lose that fucking sponsorship in a second.  Yeah,  but you would think the same thing about,  like,  a,  I don't know,  morning news personality.  Oh.  You know,  it happens.  Oh,  the Nicolini factor?  Yeah,  yeah,  it happens.  That was also an odd thing,  wasn't it?  That was also before you were,  uh,  you know,  doing fucking bell curve tweets.  Let's be honest,  you've snapped a little.  No,  I haven't.  I've always been like,  Anthony has lost his way.  I wasn't tweeting in favor of eugenics.  I was tweeting about eugenics. 
[02:03:00]  Just that there were some arguments that could be made.  Arguments can be made.  Okay.  Yes,  indeed.  Yeah.  Maybe you're right,  Jim.  Maybe Joe Nicolini,  if he was tweeting the eugenics tweets,  wouldn't have been so.  Things have changed.  Yeah.  For Anthony.  I don't think they have.  I know you don't.  I think we never have the ability to see ourselves as everyone else does.  As either sees.  It's okay.  Uh,  no,  no,  I,  uh,  I do believe I have always felt this way and been like this and, 
[02:03:30]  uh,  wondered certain things.  Uh,  but now through,  uh,  Twitter and whatnot,  you have the opportunity to expand,  expound,  uh,  about this,  um,  certain,  um,  uh,  beliefs and,  uh,  ideologies.  Just opening the conversation.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Like last night,  I was on a nigger mania.com and I was,  uh,  well,  I did every night though.  It's every night.  No,  it's not every night. 
[02:04:00]  And I go to many websites.  I go to many different websites that get both sides of the story.  There's the horrifically racist white sites and the horrifically racist militant black sites where they just wish harm and death and destruction on white people.  And then the,  the other sites are making fun of,  uh,  black people.  Right.  And,  um,  you know,  I am like the,  the guy that can absorb from all of this.  I go to TMZ.  What?  Yeah.  I go to TMB. 
[02:04:30]  It's amazing though.  You do absorb from all sites,  but yet when the sponge is squeezed,  what comes out of it is not,  not quite a reflection of all the sites.  Oh boy.  Uh,  I must say though,  there's a lot of fun videos out there of,  um,  hijinks and shenanigans more so on the,  uh,  white side about blacks than on the black side about whites. 
[02:05:00]  There are just fun videos to watch.  I mean,  that's true.  And world star hip hop is a black site and they just consistently put out videos of black people.  They love it.  Yeah.  They love showing like black people fighting is good.  Yeah.  Um,  causing a ruckus in perhaps,  um,  restaurants,  um,  Denny's most,  uh,  most of the time.  I've seen many a chair fight at Denny's,  uh,  on,  on world star hip hop.  Um,  just basic,  um, 
[02:05:30]  lawlessness.  It's very strange that black people like watching videos of black people acting like buffoons.  Yes.  And white people like watching videos of black people acting like buffoons.  You know what?  It is much like Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un talking about basketball.  There's the common ground that we ought to meet on as blacks and whites.  The fact that we both enjoy watching black people be buffoons on video.  Right.  And we could start there and open up a dialogue.  That's where we start.  That's where we start. 
[02:06:00]  We could all agree that that shit's hilarious.  Yeah.  Uh,  there was a,  a March.  I was talking about that earlier.  The,  um,  the March.  And,  uh,  I guess,  um,  it was in Selma,  right?  Yeah.  That was where that,  uh,  bloody Sunday March was years ago.  I don't know.  And,  um,  yeah,  so they had a,  an anniversary of it.  And Joe Biden,  Vice President Joe Biden was down there linking arms,  arm in arm,  a lot of arm linking.  Um,  Jesse Jackson was there.  His criminal,  uh,  nut job son wasn't, 
[02:06:30]  I guess he was busy,  but,  uh,  Jesse Jackson was there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Breaking the law and extorting money from embezzling money from his constituents.  Uh,  but white people always look so stupid,  linked arms,  walking,  uh,  doing that.  We shall overcome a song.  They look out of place and uncomfortable.  Even Joe Biden,  um,  is linking arms and,  and just,  he,  he looked silly.  You really have to be black to do that.  You'll look like the guy that doesn't belong there. 
[02:07:00]  And you know what?  In a way you kind of don't.  It's about,  you know,  black people and,  and their,  uh,  voter rights,  um,  march that they were doing at the anniversary of the Selma March.  And you just look silly as a white guy in the front of the line,  especially.  I know he's the vice president,  but no,  it's true.  I mean,  white guys probably,  if they're going to make a change,  uh,  need to change from the inside.  Yes.  Like white people protesting is like,  what's he doing?  What is he doing?  You're already on the inside.  It's like,  we shall overcome who? 
[02:07:30]  You,  Joe,  you're the vice president.  You could already,  you could do it already.  You're the guy.  You don't have to overcome anything except maybe your fucking mental,  mental frame of mind and your thoughts on how to defend yourself with a shotgun.  Apparently he also later on said,  uh,  about his,  uh,  shotgun for home defense,  uh,  that you just shoot through a door.  Yeah.  He's talking about shooting through a door.  If somebody is,  um,  coming for,  so some guy actually did that and was arrested.  Some are really arrested for reckless endangerment.  Yeah.  He just means if your girlfriend's cowering in the bathroom. 
[02:08:00]  Oh yeah,  that's it.  Strap on your spatulas and,  uh,  let rip.  Uh,  yeah.  Biden's shotgun through the door.  How does,  how come Biden doesn't get called out more on his dopey shit?  We're used to him saying dumb shit.  Although it is really funny how,  again,  not that that'd be the media liberal paranoid,  but Dan Quayle,  but then he misspelled potato and he was a retard for life.  He fucking said a lot of dopey shit and they just didn't leave him alone. 
[02:08:30]  All the talk shows were on top of him constantly.  And now Joe Biden has had a multitude of just some of the dumbest shit that he's,  uh,  he said,  and he gets away.  Is this it?  Let me,  potato.  Potato.  Oh,  he made the kid put an E at the end of potato.  That was incorrect.  Oh,  remember that? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah,  you forgot one little thing at the end and the kid's like,  no,  I know how to spell potato.  And he makes the kid,  he guilts the kid into writing a fucking E at the end.  Phonetically,  you're correct,  but,  potato.  No,  incorrect.  How embarrassing.  But the fact that that became a huge thing that the guy just made a spelling mistake.  Huge.  And we wonder,  well,  this is the same people,  which is us,  that made a big deal out of his spelling error,  are the same ones who are complaining that our anonymity is the only thing that allows us to run on a fucking line and go, 
[02:09:30]  Jigaboos suck.  Like,  we're the same people.  Yeah,  yeah.  Dan probably was an idiot.  Yes,  he was.  Oh,  are these some of his quotes?  Let's hear this.  I like this,  obviously.  Let me just tell you how thrilling it really is,  and what a challenge it is,  because in 1988,  the question is whether we're going to go forward to tomorrow,  or we're going to go past to the back.  We don't want to go back to tomorrow. 
[02:10:00]  We want to move forward.  I believe that I've made good judgments in the past,  and I think I've made good judgments in the future.  We'll be better tomorrow.  Well,  Bobby Knight told me this.  He says,  there is nothing that a good defense can not be a better offense.  Oh no.  I was known as the chief grave robber of my state.  What?  I have a very strong record on the environment in the United States Senate. 
[02:10:30]  What a dick wagon.  It's a pivotal role in the Pacific.  It is in the Pacific,  the part of the United States that is an island that is right here.  For those of you whose eyes may be fluttering in disbelief,  let me repeat that.  Hey,  it's Lewis.  Hawaii has always been a very pivotal role in the Pacific.  It is in the Pacific.  It is a part of the United States that is an island that is right here. 
[02:11:00]  Oh my God.  He just dropped an award.  Can you show that again?  Hold on.  He's getting an award and he drops it on the podium.  It was a space shuttle model.  Oh God.  It was a space shuttle model.  He just dropped it.  Oh,  he's a different man from the intellectual midget that has been portrayed in much of the media.  Wow. 
[02:11:30]  That's a good bunch of clips.  Have you heard?  He has done nothing.  Like he just went away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really did.  What happened to him?  He got tired of people calling him a fucking idiot and decided to go.  Maybe that was it.  Live in a cabin somewhere or something.  What's he doing with himself?  He did resurface.  You forget about Dan Quayle.  Dan Quayle.  He was the vice president.  Remember all the shit he took about the Murphy Brown thing?  He was talking about how a single mom like that was not.  That's where family values came in.  And that was the big catchphrase. 
[02:12:00]  Whenever these guys comment on pop culture, they fucking...  Yeah.  They fell miserably.  Shut up.  Well, Obama had a faux pas with his pop culture.  His pop culture quote.  Forgot all that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was talking about the budget crisis and the sequester and how it's going to affect  people and whatnot.  And he mentioned that he could not Jedi mind meld with people. 
[02:12:30]  He could not Jedi mind meld with people.  And, of course, he's mixing up Jedi mind trick and Vulcan mind meld, which, of course,  if you're a geek, and this was discussed ad nauseum at the Nagel birthday table with  Big Kev, I'm sure.  Did you hear what he said?  Oh, it's terrible.  He called it a Jedi mind meld.  Obviously, everyone knows Mr. Spock, a Vulcan, does the mind meld.  And a Jedi does the mind trick. 
[02:13:00]  These are not the droids you're looking for.  That's the mind trick.  The mind meld, you've got to touch the guy's face.  Maybe he was saying, I can't do a Jedi mind meld because it doesn't exist.  I can't score a touchdown in baseball.  I think he fucked up.  The counter-argument would be that Jedi mind tricks and Vulcan mind melds also do not exist  because they're fictional.  Well, that's true.  That's up for speculation.  Jedi mind meld is not an option during sequester negotiations.  What did he mean, though? 
[02:13:30]  Did he mean the Jedi mind trick, or did he mean the Vulcan mind meld?  Like, he meant something.  He meant one of those things.  Like, could he go in like fucking Vader and just start fucking force choking these guys  that aren't...  Well, what's the mind meld?  The mind meld is where Spock places his fingers on the side of your...  Like, the bridge of your nose above your eye, side of your head, and he says, he shuts  his eyes and he starts looking and your minds meld together.  So he feels and knows what you want. 
[02:14:00]  He actually did it with a whale in the Star Trek, the Voyage Home thing.  Find out if the whale's doing okay.  Yeah, and he found out that Gracie was pregnant.  Oh.  By the mind trick!  I think he meant mind trick.  Did he?  I think he meant that he could go up and then tell everybody, like, you want to pass the  budget.  Like, we want to pass the budget.  We don't want to cut anything.  We want to raise taxes.  Is that it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We want to raise taxes. 
[02:14:30]  We want to be president doing something.  But he is free.  He's a president of writing.  His president.  That's what they would say.  God.  Talk sucker.  Why would he mind trick them into wanting to...  Yeah.  That is a little...  That is a little weird and fucking ominous that he would...  He would even bring up something like that.  Like, the fact that he can't do it, he thought about what it would be like to be able to do  it.  Like, if I had my way, I would have absolute power and control their minds.  Right.  But unfortunately, I do not. 
[02:15:00]  Exactly.  Just walk in.  Why would he vocalize what every one of us thinks every day of their life would be  if...  Wouldn't it be?  But it only works on the weak-minded.  So he would be able to affect every single member.  Yeah.  Because they are all stupid.  Get it?  I did not.  Ugh.  Yeah, that was...  And again, it's what you brought up.  The fact that any time they try to delve into pop culture, they fail miserably.  Because they're all really so far out of touch.  You realize these guys' entire lives have been dedicated to politics. 
[02:15:30]  That's it.  And they really don't know much else about anything.  Which is odd that we choose these people to represent us.  They learn how to parrot the right things and say the right phrases.  Yeah.  And express the right emotion.  That's why that's just dog shit when they mention people's names.  Joe the Plumber.  It's like that's them attempting to take...  They really are like...  Yes.  ...completely detached.  And they take what they hear and they are trying to mimic the emotion. 
[02:16:00]  That they're fucking awful.  Yeah.  They honestly think that's what people want to hear.  And since they know they can't pull off saying...  Unless it's years ago.  They're like, I grew up in a small town.  But they can't talk about what they've done recently.  And make themselves sound relatable.  So it's always...  You know, on the campaign stop the other day, I spoke to a little woman that was a waitress at a diner.  And she told me...  And they've got to convey these bullshit...  Absolute bullshit stories.  To try to make them sound like they can relate. 
[02:16:30]  That's why during...  When Obama was talking about Newtown...  I really believed the emotion.  I actually believed it very much.  Oh, who wouldn't be sad?  It was terrible.  Yeah.  But I mean, that was a real moment.  And when Biden was talking about...  He was talking to some returning veterans.  And he was talking about when his wife...  I think it was his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident many years ago.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he started...  He kind of went off book and was talking about that.  It really...  Like, kind of, I know what you're dealing with when you lose people.  I can't not look at that, though.  And think it's...  I can't not think it's calculated.  It could be honest.  It could be an honest moment. 
[02:17:00]  But I can't help but think they think that honest moment will be of some value to them.  Maybe.  I mean...  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, Obama was looking for some way to get into the gun control issue.  And that was it.  Not that he wouldn't feel absolutely horrible about what happened.  But then again, you can say, ah, all right, it did happen.  I might as well get some mileage out of it.  Yeah.  It looks like it's possible.  But we all kind of do that, I guess.  I mean...  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Uh, you know, we show emotions when it suits us and we don't when it doesn't.  Mm-hmm.  Some of us just haven't shown emotions since the summer of 1973.  Some of us have all love and sadness and fear come out in rage.  I got to tell you something.  Sure.  I'm pretty good in certain circles.  Like circles of two.  Yes.  Like circle jerks.  Yes.  With a cracker.  I'm really good.  Yes.  No, when I'm like, when I'm with somebody, not a guy, when I'm with a young lady, let's 
[02:18:00]  say, I'm pretty good.  I'm not very cold or shut off.  Right.  I'm pretty, I'm pretty, you know, not emotional when I start fucking weeping openly in front  of, did you see this?  You did.  When's the last time you cried?  What?  When's the last time you cried?  Out of frustration or sadness? 
[02:18:30]  Sadness.  Or frustration?  I had tears of frustration when I was getting fucked in the ass from the divorce.  Okay.  I was like, fuck that!  But sadness?  Maybe 95?  When your dad died?  Yeah.  But no movie?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, how ironic, right?  The last time I cry, I get all pissy-eyed. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Was when my dad died and he was the one that told me to not be pissy-eyed.  Yeah.  My ex was like that.  She just didn't cry during movies.  I'm blubbering and she's not.  I don't know how you do that.  Well, there's a difference between, like, a healthy emotion and being a faggot.  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true.  What movies make you weep?  But a lot of them, you know, Cuckoo's Nest has made me cry many times.  Yeah.  Tragic films.  A lot of them.  Even sometimes.  Lost.  Lost, I cried through all of season one.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  There's certain weird things that will make me cry.  But again, I know I'm a fucking blubbering jizzbag.  But the extreme that you go to on the other side is interesting to me.  It doesn't mean, like, you can't not get the urge.  I'm trying to think of sad things that have happened, though.  You just divert the train.  Over that.  You divert the fucking train before it gets there.  Like, you know what I mean?  You have the track switch before it gets right to that.  Before it gets to sadness?  Yeah.  Let me think.  I'm trying to think of what has been sad in 20 years.  Because you're too perceptive and intuitive, and you pick up on things too well to not 
[02:20:00]  have sadness hit you.  I get sadness.  I understand it.  I know when it is.  I feel it.  But it doesn't manifest itself into that physical response of tears.  You're like one of those advanced creatures Jim was talking about.  What is the salty discharge?  I care.  When you say that, it's on your back.  Oh, boy. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  It is weird.  It is interesting to me, because you're not an unsensitive guy.  Like, people who don't know you hear you rant.  But if the aunt is really generous and fucking giving and a great host, like, you do all  these things that are anti-cocksucker.  Yeah.  No, I am very close to the people that I love.  And, you know, I got good friends and things like that.  But there's just that one thing of, like, real sadness, where I'm just like, you know, 
[02:21:00]  I can't do that.  I just can't fucking...  It's very healthy.  You can't blubber.  It's very healthy.  How do I blubber?  What should I do?  You're welcome.  I didn't mean that.  Poor birthday kid.  It just doesn't end.  I know, it doesn't.  I don't know.  It's hard.  It's not a matter of how do I do it. 
[02:21:30]  It's how do I keep preventing myself from doing it.  You think that's what I do?  I do.  For some movies, I'll be, like, watching.  And if someone else is in the room, I, like, don't want them to hear the big, like that.  You know how you go, so I'll just sit there with, like, my mouth open, saliva building,  because I don't want to swallow, because it'll be too loud.  Blinking quickly.  It's like it stops you from...  It's all this weird stuff we do to stop us from...  And it's weird.  Sometimes it comes out, and you're like, oh, that's kind of weird.  I would feel so stupid. 
[02:22:00]  But why?  Alone, I'd feel stupid.  But why?  I don't know.  It's a lot...  We never feel stupid if we get angry watching TV.  No one ever feels stupid getting angry or getting turned on.  So, you know, when you see somebody angry, you're not like, look at that pussy.  Just being angry.  Anger is just...  Anger is just...  Dad would be proud.  A smokescreen.  If he stopped me from crying.  After being weepy, cry-y little Anthony at everything, my dad finally stopped my ability  to fucking cry. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, boy.  But that's...  That's fucking...  That's it.  There's always something behind anger.  I think, yeah.  I think there's times where...  But it's always frustration.  But half the time, it's hurt feelings or sadness.  Yeah.  Or just, you know, yeah, man.  It's usually something pussy that we think is pussy-ish.  Yeah.  And it's fucking...  It's hard to acknowledge.  Men...  That's why women cry.  What do you think?  They're fucking...  They're not that much different.  Oh, please.  They're just told that it's okay.  That's why women don't fucking walk into work with a machine gun and kill their co-workers  because they don't filter everything into rage when they're sad. 
[02:23:00]  They're like, oh my God, you hurt my feelings.  And we're like, what a cunt.  And then meanwhile, we go to a bar and fucking belt somebody's teeth out instead of just crying  for five minutes.  Do you think if I was able to cry and blubber like that and get real sadness out, that  might be less...  There'd be less rage in me?  I know it for a fact.  Really?  Absolutely.  Oh, shit.  Because by cutting that stuff off, at times you lose this fucking... 
[02:23:30]  Your ability to empathize with people because you're...  And you're too smart to not to.  It's not to do with your brains.  You're too fucking...  You pick up on almost everything.  So like those things that would filter and be kind of sad.  Here we go.  I just threw water in my face.  Does that work?  My mother one time said that to me because I would always make the obnoxious remark during  a sad film.  Oh, she tried it, yeah. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, but she was like, you always have to say something obnoxious.  It's like, don't call me out on it, Mom.  But she was right.  Was she?  Yeah, and I just...  Because I don't like to feel...  It's embarrassing.  But alone, it's not that bad.  Yeah.  It's like...  But you don't feel silly afterwards?  No, because I know what anger does to me, man.  And I'm bad with it now.  Like using funny stuff to jerk off with and then after you come, you're like, ew, I kind  of feel creepy.  I did that.  Yeah, I mean...  Crying would be the same thing.  It's like, oh, really?  Am I that sad? 
[02:24:30]  Am I that emotionally invested in this fucking movie where I'm actually weeping over these  fake characters?  No, but it's...  It's a nice thing to be able to connect like that.  It really is.  Like, you know when my ex would cry a lot when we'd fight?  She would cry.  When we fuck.  Yeah, and I'll be after.  And there'd be tears of empathy for me that I actually thought I did good.  She would cry and just hug me and pat my back because I was like, am I as good as...  You know, but yeah, it's really healthy to do it, man.  Yeah.  And I'm not, you know, in some fucking new wave shit or new eight. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  But that much anger is fucking poison, man.  It's so bad.  Yeah.  I don't know how to handle good things.  I remember getting an MTV audition one time years ago.  Like I was doing something for MTV the next day.  It was really small, but it was a good thing at that time.  And I'm driving down the street and I didn't know how to handle the rush of good emotions.  So I'm driving down Houston Street.  I'm in a road rage and I'm like, I wanted to, I physically had to stop myself from running  somebody over with my car.  But that's why for good stuff.  Because again, it's the twisted filter, not knowing how to handle or process things. 
[02:25:30]  They all come out the wrong end.  They come out the wrong end.  But I love like anger.  Yes.  I love my rage.  It is.  But Bobby Fisher loved his.  And Bobby Fisher was, you can't, you can't get beyond the genius of Bobby Fisher.  And he was a Jew who hated Jews because people, he focused on this one thing that he may  have had good points about Israel.  Some of what he said about their foreign policy might've been correct, but the part that was  correct just gets blown out into everything is this. 
[02:26:00]  And then you see, it's almost like you put a fucking, not you Anthony.  He's equating me with black people as he was Bobby Fisher.  I'm creating like the kind of the ability to take something that there's correct feelings  about and filter everything through that.  Like with a, it's almost like putting a fucking, uh, a yellow or green or whatever, filter  over something.  So everything looks that way.  Oh, right, right, right.  And what happens with smart people?  It's not dumb guys that do that.  Oh, yeah.  It's smart people.  I don't know how to get more like, um, emotional on that, that sad part. 
[02:26:30]  How do you do that?  What do I do?  Well, it's like.  Watch sad movies and just like alone and just, just not fucking, not even put up any  defense.  Yeah, try not to.  What's a good movie?  What's a good sad movie for me?  The Notebook.  Oh.  Whatever it would be for you.  Yeah, whatever, Jungle Fever.  Whatever it would be for you.  As my friend Sean once said to me many, many years ago, stop trying to find who you are.  Just get rid of all the crap you're not and whoever you are shows up. 
[02:27:00]  And it's like, that's what I got to do when I'm trying to be sad or whatever.  Just fucking stop blocking it.  Don't force it and, and, you know, and try to have a moment.  I'm not consciously blocking anything, I don't think.  I don't think I'm being conscious when I, like, block anything.  I just think it just doesn't happen.  It just doesn't really.  Let me think.  I'm trying to think.  Maybe not Blubbery Cry, but I haven't even been choked up with a movie.  Let me try to think of a.  Hmm.  Maybe I could understand how people felt sad watching maybe the end of the Titanic. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  It was kind of, no, nothing.  Yeah, I mean, of course.  I didn't cry watching Titanic.  It's like, you know.  It's a fucking beautiful ship and it, it sunk.  Yeah.  And there was the people.  I think there's also, there's got to be like a personal thing.  What?  Really?  World War II stuff gets you.  When you see those guys.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, the poor vets when they're talking like Band of Brothers and then they have the real  guys.  Yeah.  That were being portrayed in Band of Brothers and then they talk in the last episode. 
[02:28:00]  They all, like, reveal who they were and, and their, their ties together and everything.  All right.  That'll do it.  Now, how come that works?  Because it's probably what, one of your, we all have those weird Achilles things.  Maybe yours is watching strong people.  Oh.  Reduced to what you see as weak or whatever.  But I mean, that gets to all of us.  When you see strength kind of, uh, knocked down, it's like, wow.  Like when you see like a, we see a boxer cry or something like that.  Nobody thinks like, what a faggot.  Cause you can't, he's too much of, too much of a tough guy or an alpha male. 
[02:28:30]  Ah.  So seeing strength sometimes, uh.  Vulnerable.  Yeah.  It's, it's, you know, whatever it is for any of us, it might be, uh, you know, it might  be different for all of us.  All right.  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, maybe, I'll, maybe I need something like that.  Yeah.  Saving Private Ryan was, was, was pretty sad.  At the end there.  Yeah.  Where he asks if he's been a good man.  Yeah.  That was pretty sad.  Um.  Hmm.  Yeah.  It's not, I don't know what it is for everybody, but it's like, it does.  Hmm.  I mean, there's those fucking, I can't say what's going to do it, what's not going to 
[02:29:00]  do it.  Like, what makes me, like the end of Cuckoo's Nest, I've seen it 50 times and every time  he's like, ah, just leave, McPurphy.  Just fucking leave.  You got a chance.  Yeah.  You helping these people, dummy.  He never, he never leaves.  No, he doesn't.  He stays there like a dope.  That's a lobotomy.  And Billy, Billy Bibbett's not stuttering.  He's helping these people that are playing cards normally.  It's such a weird subtext to it.  He's certainly, uh, the staff there didn't understand that.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  So stuff like that. 
[02:29:30]  That is a sad one.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  I did choke up at Ghost years ago.  Where that single, single tear goes down to me more's face.  That was kind of sad.  Come on, Glory, Glory doesn't get to you?  Like, maybe I like.  Glory holes.  Glory.  That makes you cry in the other way because you're gagging.  Glory?  Glory.  But when fucking Denzel is being whipped and he's fucking, that moment that won on the  Oscar and he, and he just, he, he's the, the, the acting he's doing even, even if you  know, it's not the slavery that gets you.  But when that fucking teardrops, when he's just defiantly looking into the camera at 
[02:30:00]  the, and he won't cry, he just fucking drops one because he's being beaten so badly.  The Morgan Freeman speech to him was nice when he fucking, uh, slaps Denzel and he shames  him.  He shames this guy by making the rest of them like, you know, we're behaving like men and  you're not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That didn't even, not even the, not even the part about the white boys dying for you.  Cause that to me sounds like a fucking white writer put it in, but the idea of it's time 
[02:30:30]  for us to fucking pony up like men.  And he, Denzel just sits there with that fucking, that realization on his face and horrified  look of that he, this guy's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's well, I don't know.  Maybe that's not for you, but I mean, that's the type of stuff that gets to me.  Maybe not.  You know, uh, let's say, uh, you know, for you, the jungle fever where their lips meet.  Oh, it's terrible.  Yeah.  What are they saying over there for sad movies?  This is just the list I found. 
[02:31:00]  Uh, E.T.  Oh, stop.  At the end when E.T. tells Elliot, I'll be right here.  And he plays to Elliot's heart.  Oh.  That didn't get to me.  When he was laying on the floor like an old dog turd.  And, fuck, that was a little sad.  Oh, yeah.  A little dying on a bathroom floor.  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  On linoleum.  Uh, Up in the Air.  Oh.  Nah, it didn't get to me.  Stupid balloon movie.  My Girl.  The end.  Oh, that was pretty sad when she's crying and shit in the fucking funeral.  What an awful funeral that is.  All right, that's pretty bad right there. 
[02:31:30]  Gone Baby Gone.  No, I don't think that got to me.  Uh, Shane.  Oh, Shane.  That's the old western.  Shane.  Yep.  I don't remember.  Good fellas.  Shane.  Shane.  Yep.  Shane.  Well.  Gran Torino.  Uh, no.  No.  No.  Never Let Me Go.  No.  I didn't see that one.  Terms of Endearment.  Yeah, I had some fucking moments.  Yeah, Debra Winger dropping dead of cancer was fucking pretty miserable. 
[02:32:00]  Awakenings.  There was a couple of moments in that that got me, I think, um, I don't remember what, but  there was something.  When he knew he was going back to being a retard, or whatever it is.  Yeah.  It's a coma.  Yeah, it's usually these weird little, what else?  Brian's song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Let's see, let me go to Titanic.  Green Mile.  Green Mile, really?  Marley and Me, which I will not see.  Oh, that's not the dog.  They raised the dog.  It's like you own a dog for the movie, and then it dies. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Great.  That is fucking...  I completely hid that from the viewers, from everything.  It looks like this awesome movie about a...  Don't tell me.  I didn't see it, but I know it happens.  Family got his little dog.  You know what?  That's trying.  Man, though.  That's like, look, we're going to make you cry.  Fuck you.  And it works.  Nah, I don't want to.  I don't mind when it works.  Like, even though, like, sometimes it's schmaltzy and it doesn't really get to me.  And sometimes when it does, it makes me feel more normal.  Like, I'm such a fucking wacko with shit.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  And sometimes, you know what?  I'm just being a fucking fruit, watching a fucking sad movie, crying like some woman.  Like some woman.  Yeah, I'm like Johnny Fontaine.  Yeah.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Schindler's List.  Schindler's List.  Oh, that got me the other day.  I made out during Schindler's List.  Huh?  That was bad.  What happened in the bunker?  You made out?  The girl in a red dress?  Fucking creep.  You made out during Schindler's List?  Yes, of course.  The Notebook?  The Notebook.  Schindler's List didn't get to you when that fucking...  Oh, yeah, because what happened in the bunker? 
[02:33:30]  The brutality of that or that red dress?  I read the book first.  It was really terrible, but it wasn't a sad terrible.  It was just a, oh my God, that's fucking terrible.  The realization of that fucking...  I pawed the new.  Oh, it was fucking...  I pawed the new.  The horror these people went through.  The piano was sad.  Or the pianist.  Not the piano.  The pianist.  I saw that the other day.  That was good.  Was that with...  Yeah, what's his name?  Oh, not Brody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Brody, yeah.  Yeah, Adrian Brody.  Adrian Brody, yes.  Adrian Brody. 
[02:34:00]  Adrian Brody.  I'm Brody.  What?  I'm Brody.  I'm Brody.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Fuck yeah.  More Nazi stuff.  That's all he said.  Yeah.  What else?  It's all subjective.  Yeah, but some...  Requiem for a Dream.  Sophie's Choice.  Requiem for a Dream.  Sophie's Choice!  My movie was dead!  They are a joke!  We are dead!  That's one of the saddest moments on this show.  I know!  Tippy Tom crying over Sophie's Choice was terrible.  All right. 
[02:34:30]  Star Trek II Wrath of Khan.  The hell?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When...  The first time I saw that was actually in the movie theater.  And, you know, when Spock drops dead there, and Kirk's just kind of, like, fucking lost.  It's like, oh my god.  Oh my god.  Yeah, that was pretty sad.  But then knowing Shatner now and what a fucking prick on wheels he is.  I love William Shatner.  It's hard to get worked up at that scene. 
[02:35:00]  And then you know he comes back to life anyway.  Sorry for the spoiler.  What got me in the theater when I saw Malcolm X in the theater.  That got me.  Really?  Yes.  What part?  Um, when he meets X and he cries.  What do you mean?  When he meets Elijah Muhammad, I feel like it's just an acting moment that was amazing.  And when he, uh, at the end when he gets shot, and they have this whole I am Malcolm X.  That's where they got that whole I am whatever from.  That was the Spike Lee thing.  All these people.  And then they got Mandela.  I'm gonna have to, um...  Oh, and Ozzie Davis' eulogy.  Yeah.  When, yeah, when he's reading the...  I don't know if that's an actual recording or if that's just them playing it. 
[02:35:30]  But they're showing all this real footage of X.  And I was like, that got to me.  Huh.  I need to really be able to relate, I think, to what's going on on the screen.  Yeah, so do I.  Field of Dreams is the only thing that'll do it for me.  Oh, yeah.  And that's because baseball and fathers and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  What happens?  Does the guy's wife run off of the juke?  Exactly.  She runs off of one of the owners.  Are people calling the sad movies?  Oh, man.  Yeah, they are.  What are some suggestions?  Oh, let's take some phone calls. 
[02:36:00]  I know.  I forgot that thing existed.  I know.  At first, I was like, what is that blinking green monstrosity?  Oh.  All right.  Let's take some calls, shall we?  Go to Brian.  Brian.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Great.  Into the Wild.  That story about Chris McAllis.  I didn't see it.  Yeah?  I thought that kid was such a fucking moron.  He didn't make me cry at all.  Didn't do it for you.  No, it was so stupid.  Of course, I'm glad he's dead.  So you have a completely different point of view.  Oh, you spoiled it right there.  Yeah, he died. 
[02:36:30]  More spoilers.  Because he's a spoiled kid who decided to find himself and go in the forest.  What an asshole.  That's true.  Thank you, sir.  Is that sad?  Just ruined it for that guy.  Ruined it for everybody that hadn't seen it.  That's an old movie.  What about beaches?  I guess so.  Yeah, beaches make you cry.  The Wind Beneath Your Wings?  Oh, that's the one with fucking...  Who's it now?  Pett Midler?  Pett Midler.  Pett Midler.  And who else?  Some other chick.  That other broad.  Barbara Hershey?  Barbara Hershey? 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  E.T. used to make me upset as a kid, but not to end the beginning.  I used to get so upset when his family left him and he was alone on the planet.  I used to...  Oh, is that it?  I always fast forward to when the spaceship leaves him and he's just looking.  And he's just looking around like, what the fuck?  I don't know if E.T. did or what, like, throughout my whole childhood.  It was E.T. and Punky Brewster.  I was always afraid my parents were going to leave me somewhere.  Abandonment issues?  I had that too.  Oh, man.  My dad would be like a baseball game and he'd go to, like, get a soda and I would think  that he would not come back. 
[02:37:30]  That's called foreshadowing.  Oh, no.  But I had no reason to think that.  Your mother ran off with a soda berg.  I don't know why I'm hoping my mother.  It's like a Jewish name.  Soda berg.  Uh, soda.  Soda.  Uh, Ian.  Ian in Jersey.  Ian.  Ian.  Morning, gentlemen.  What's up, man?  Forrest Gump.  That had a lot of chokers in there.  Yeah.  Yeah, that had a few...  You know what?  That Forrest Gump, when I'm not being a cunt watching it, it actually gets to me.  Yeah.  I think...  Philadelphia made me cry. 
[02:38:00]  The only real sad part of Forrest Gump is kind of the end there, where he was with  his little fucking kid that could see dead people.  Yeah.  Or even the...  Bubba, the black guy with the big lips.  Oh, Bubba.  I didn't care about that.  When Bubba dies.  Bubba.  Big dumb Bubba.  Yeah.  This fat family.  No, I don't think that was even very sad.  Even when she...  Ginny gets the AIDS and he buries her at the base of a tree like a fucking squirrel.  German shepherd.  Yeah.  Who else have we got here? 
[02:38:30]  Chris in Long Island.  Hey there, Chris.  Hey, and it's Chris in Livewire, Joe's friend.  I'm going to claim first to say no homo here, but Steel Magnolias every fucking time.  I can't stop bawling.  I don't remember...  Steel Magnolias?  The new one?  The black one?  What?  Isn't there a new one with black people?  Yeah, that would make you cry, right?  Of course.  Why wouldn't it?  Thank you.  These are sad movies, but I'm not going to watch these, and I don't think they'd do anything  to me.  I need a movie that, like... 
[02:39:00]  You need a personal touch.  Yes, I need something.  You're not just going to cry over something that's sad.  Yeah, whatever it is that gets you.  What is it that gets me?  God.  I would imagine father-son stuff.  I could do it.  You're the strong, sexual figure, because that, to you, is the guy that you looked up to.  Tarryton commercials.  That's what he used to smoke.  Yeah.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  You want to do one more?  That'd be a good movie I could watch.  Son of a bitch.  Dot, dot, dot.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:39:30]  The story of young...  Yes.  Don't be a faggot tonight on Lifetime.  Exactly.  Although, uh...  I think our guest is walking to the studio right now.  Oh, really?  No, she's, uh...  They changed it to nine.  All right, let's take a break.  Well, I didn't know that.  You're going to take a break?  Yeah, we'll take a break.  We'll take a single.  I got to pee.  I thought it was 9.30.  Let's take a single.  We'll pee.  We'll fucking do everything, and then we'll come back with the Gillian Jacobs.  Let's do it.  Can't tell if we're back or I'm supposed to read something. 
[02:40:00]  I don't know.  I'd do both.  Oh, you know something.  Uh, Anthony Jizzelnik.  Uh, or Jizzelnik.  It's Jizzelnik or Jizzelnik.  Let's call the whole thing from Comedy Central's Rose to Charlie Sheen and Donald Trump. 
[02:40:30]  Now, he's bringing that same wicked sense of humor to his own weekly series called The Jizzelnik Offensive.  Tomorrow night on Comedy Central every week, Jizzelnik gives his hilarious and twisted take on the darkest news stories of the moment.  The stuff no other show would touch.  And each week, Anthony has two of the hottest comedians joining him to rip on pop culture and those off-limit topics.  Tomorrow, it's Christian Schall and Billy Eichner.  Yeah, they say life is cruel. 
[02:41:00]  Well, so is he.  The Jizzelnik Offensive with Anthony Jizzelnik.  Tomorrow, 9.30 p.m.  9.30.  Uh, 8.30.  10.30.  What?  Let me try that again.  Tomorrow at 10.30 p.m.  9.30 Central after an all-new Tosh on Comedy Central.  Yes.  All right, we're back.  And, um, I guess Gillian Jacobs is here?  Oh, yeah.  Is she outside the sh-sh-studio door?  Is Roland chatting with her?  Yeah.  Is he chatting it up?  I'm going to stop flirting.  Ooh, here she comes.  Got the water, got the mic, got the headphones, got everything. 
[02:41:30]  Here she is.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello.  Oh, my God.  I keep forgetting how cute Hollywood girls are.  There's such an air about, like, um, girls that are on television and movies.  I gotta say, like, you could walk around, and there are plenty of pretty girls all over  every, you know, major city in the country.  You walk around the streets, you're like, ah, that's a pretty girl.  That's a pretty girl.  But there's this, like, there's like an aura around television and movie stars. 
[02:42:00]  You'll look fantastic.  Thank you.  Don't you look great, everybody?  Yeah.  I want this to be more like the old Carson show.  Although, right now, it's like the king of comedy in the basement.  That is one of my favorite movies, king of comedy.  Ho, ho, ho, Rupert Pupkin.  Wonderful, Rupert Pupkin.  Wonderful.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rupert Pupkin.  Gillian, your vacationing agrees with you.  Doesn't she look terrific?  Oh, my God, do this now.  This is Creed 4, the radio.  Yes.  You look different than last time. 
[02:42:30]  I dyed my hair brown.  Yeah, that's it.  But your natural is?  My natural is somewhat lighter than this.  But, you know, being an actress, I haven't seen my natural hair color in years.  So, who knows anymore?  They made you like dying?  I just did a movie where the lead actress was blonde.  So, they're like, you gotta go brunette.  So, it's fun.  I like it.  Oh, shit, they don't want two blondes in the air.  No, they never want two blondes.  Who's the lead actress?  Elizabeth Banks.  Why didn't they make her dire hair?  You're funny.  Well, community, obviously. 
[02:43:00]  Still kicking.  Still kicking.  Joe McHale was in here about a month ago.  Uh-huh.  And almost talking of the demise of the program.  And then we find out you guys are still cranking.  We're still cranking.  I mean, it remains to be seen if we'll do another season.  But I remain eternally hopeful because I love the show, even though it's a sad little baby that tries.  It's very popular.  And how many years has it been on now?  This is our fourth season that's airing right now. 
[02:43:30]  And is that actual years in this TV show?  Because some things are like, we're on its 10th season.  We've been on three months.  I know.  We call them seasons, but it's every week.  It's cycles on America's Next Top Model.  We've been on since 2009.  Oh, okay.  So, whatever that is.  That works out mathematically.  That's the only realistic season to me.  It's got to be a year.  Stop.  I agree with you.  People that say seasons.  We've been on 10 seasons.  Shut up.  Do you miss Chevy?  Well, we haven't shot without him yet, so I don't know yet. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yes, right.  You shot everything.  Ah.  If we come back, I can tell you.  But right now, I don't know.  But are you happy that you won't be shooting with the Chevy Chase?  I would say that, you know, obviously, from things he said in interviews, he was not happy  doing the show.  I love how everyone...  I was so diplomatic, right?  I know.  Why would anybody just say that he's a dick?  He's a dick.  It's fun, because we've been through this with Joel.  He's shitty to everybody he works with.  He really comes off like just the worst guy to work with. 
[02:44:30]  We've interviewed enough for you guys.  Obviously, we know Joel.  We've had a few.  Dan and you.  You're all nice.  It's not all you.  Well, you know, I think that it's a really hard show to shoot.  It's a lot of hours.  And maybe if I was 67, I wouldn't feel like working for 16 hours a day.  So what was his excuse when he was on vacation movies for being a prick?  Exactly.  Or on phone calls or in person.  Some people don't like to work hard.  I mean, I understand that.  I mean, you know, sure. 
[02:45:00]  I would imagine if I become an internationally famous movie star, maybe I, too, will not want  to work hard anymore.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Give it a try.  What is your movie with Elizabeth Banks about?  Is it sad?  We were talking about sad movies.  It's not sad.  I've been in a lot of sad movies, guys.  Oh, yes.  Have you died in movies?  Oh, yes.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  This movie I did, I was a runaway who became a stripper.  Whoa!  Who got hepatitis and I died.  I had jaundice in the movie.  They painted me yellow and I froze to death. 
[02:45:30]  Holy shit!  Wow, wait.  What the hell?  What was this?  Was this a lighthearted comedy romp?  Yeah.  Before Community, all I did was really depressing indie movies where I was mainly runaway prostitutes,  strippers, drug addicts.  Wow.  Been raped a lot.  Nice.  Holy shit!  What's your saddest movie you did?  I did this movie called Gardens of the Night where my character was abducted by Tom Arnold  and another guy at the age of six, put into a child prostitution ring and then later was 
[02:46:00]  a street prostitute.  So that was pretty sad.  So that was pretty sad.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ!  You play some great characters.  Yeah.  Wow!  Would you cry watching your own movie?  Uh, that one was really hard to watch, especially the little girl version of me was a really great actress.  So it was terrible to watch.  Yeah.  Because they did it really realistically.  Tom Arnold's actually really good in this film.  And watching it with an audience, you just hear people gasping and my mom said she just  could not watch it.  He's probably not acting the creep. 
[02:46:30]  Oh!  Yeah.  I'm teasing, of course.  Tom footage.  I loved him in True Lies.  He's great.  I know.  Wonderful.  So you've cried watching that?  I watched that one with an audience, which is, I think, the only way I could get through  it was because it was at a premiere of it.  But sometimes when they're that depressing, it's too hard to watch.  Yeah.  Anthony can't.  We were talking to say, Anthony has trouble crying during a movie.  He doesn't get sad.  Not trouble.  I just don't, like, weep.  I don't.  He asked me when the last time I even cried was, and I think it was, yeah, 1995 when  my dad died. 
[02:47:00]  And that's it.  But I see movies, and I understand they're sad, and, you know, but I can't just...  Oh, it'll get me.  Sometimes, if I'm in the right mood, a commercial will get me.  I mean...  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes I get...  I was getting so frustrated with how sappy I was that I forced myself to not cry at  some, like, little kid parent commercial that I knew normally would really just get me.  I'm a sap.  Yeah.  A couple of commercials, like, let me think.  I wouldn't be crying over them, but the little one with the little poor Emma, Emma, 
[02:47:30]  Bonana, Fana, Fofema, and the guy comes in, the male nurse, and he's like, okay, we'll  give you this shot.  And she's like, obviously has cancer.  Headish.  Like, she's got the little kerchief on her head.  And he's, like, singing a song with her so she could take the medicine.  And that's kind of, like, sweet and everything.  You know, but it's not getting me blubbering or anything.  I played a cancer patient in a commercial once.  Of course you did.  Oh, no.  When I was in high school, I did a local commercial in Pittsburgh for a hospital, and 
[02:48:00]  I played a girl who had had cancer.  And it aired every morning during SportsCenter, so every boy in my high school saw this commercial  and they used to make fun of me all the time.  All the wonderful boys.  I know.  Were you, like, the healthiest cancer patient ever?  I was.  Yeah, they didn't do anything with my hair.  They weren't even doing your full head of hair.  Hey, the hospital was so great, I made a full recovery.  Oh, that's okay.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And we had TVs in our cafeteria, and it aired one day during lunch, and all the boys from 
[02:48:30]  my homeroom, like, stood up and sarcastically gave me a slow clap.  Slow clap?  It was so humiliating, yeah.  Oh, man.  It must have made you very popular, though.  Nothing made me popular.  Are you kidding?  No.  I swear, I even recently got a tweet from someone I went to high school with saying,  I remember being an asshole to you in middle school, and I just wanted to apologize.  Oh, the gym teacher?  No.  The teachers were way nicer to me than the other kids.  Were you gangly?  I was.  Were you awkward?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:49:00]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I was not even five feet tall when I started my freshman year of high school, so I was  really small and very awkward.  I had big glasses, and I wore a lot of overalls.  I was never popular.  Yeah.  Were you, do you listen to, did you listen to music that other people were listening to,  or did you have this niche little thing?  I listened to Cole Porter.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  You're one of the weirdos.  I was listening to, like, 1930s music.  Oh, please.  Yeah.  What a weirdo.  Yeah.  In overalls.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  I remember one time I was at a pool party, and kids were playing this game.  They're like, let's go underwater, and then you hum a tune, and then if the other person  can guess it, they win.  And I started crying.  I like that at the Tommy Lee house.  It was not that kind of humming underwater.  Don't hum in a God of DeVita in its entirety.  Child, please.  All right.  He's doing fucking Greengrass and High Tides live version.  Whoops.  I'm sorry. 
[02:50:00]  The Humming Underwater.  Well, I didn't.  I started crying because they were singing all, like, top 40 songs, and I never heard  any of them, so.  Oh, you weren't into any popular music?  I made myself start listening to the radio because I was so embarrassed by that.  What a little nerd.  I was a nerd.  Were you in, like, the acting?  Oh, yeah.  Theater.  I was doing a lot of Shakespeare.  Oh, okay.  People were not into the things I was into.  Yeah.  Did you have the theater people, though, that you were, you must have been popular with  those circles.  Well, they, none of them went to my same school, so on Saturday I would go to my acting class, 
[02:50:30]  and those were all my friends, but they all, like, lived around the city, so I didn't  get to see them Monday through Friday.  Jeez.  How did you ever, like, make it out of there with any type of personality or ability to  work well with others?  Fast forward to Tinseltown.  Tinseltown.  There's a lot of strange introverts in Tinseltown, so I'm not alone in that, but...  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of shy actors, surprisingly.  Yeah.  Most of them, actually not most of them, but a lot of them, like, when you look at, like,  De Niro interviewed, he's not a good interviewer. 
[02:51:00]  No, he's very quiet.  And Dustin Hoffman's not a great interviewer.  Yeah.  It's like these amazing masters are just, I think it's almost like they're so pliable  into their roles, they're weird as people.  I don't know how it works.  I wonder if that happens, like, the better the actor you are, the less you have in your  real life, because you, like, you have to be malleable.  Like, all right, he can play anything except himself, and he's, like, an empty vessel.  And a lot of those so unhappy are, like, seems like they've got to screw loose, and I remember  as a kid, I was like, I'd rather be a mediocre actor and a happy person than a brilliant actor 
[02:51:30]  and just, like...  Just tortured constantly.  Yeah, tortured.  Yeah, so I'm very happy with my mediocrity.  You ever watch Brando interviewed?  It was not a good thing.  No.  So how are you?  Let's put Tahiti.  All right, he's a fucking psychopath.  Might be the greatest, but he's nuts.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  So, you were getting gigs then when you were in...  What was the youngest you worked?  Oh, gee, I mean, no.  Jimmy always answers my questions like it's him I'm interviewing.  I did my first play when I was eight years old.  Aw, what was it? 
[02:52:00]  It was called Steadfast Toy Soldier.  I think it was based on, like, a Hans Christian Andersen story.  Jesus, most kids would be like, Annie.  I did do Annie.  Did you do Annie?  I did Annie.  I saw some billboards for Annie as I was coming here today.  Yeah.  It's back on Broadway.  I was such a bad singer that they were just basically like, don't project.  Oh, my God.  Were you one of the kids, obviously, in the little group?  I was one of the little orphans.  You weren't little Annie.  No, I was not little Annie.  I could not sing.  Just in the back. 
[02:52:30]  It's a hard knock line.  Yeah.  They're like, further back, further back.  Think it.  Don't sing it.  Think it.  Just mouth the words.  Yeah.  She's adorable, but she can't sing a note.  It's still true.  Yeah.  It says that you competed.  I'm just reading this.  Oh, yeah.  Pittsburgh Public Theater.  You would compete in the annual Shakespeare monologue contest.  Yes.  Which is...  I think it judged that.  Yeah.  It was like American Idol for Shakespeare.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  You would do a preliminary round, and then they would pick finalists, and you'd perform 
[02:53:00]  your scene or monologue live in front of this audience, and then some theater critics  from Pittsburgh actors would judge, and you won a complete orcs of Shakespeare.  If you won.  Ooh.  Pretty exciting.  Did you...  Pretty exciting.  Did you do well in it?  I won twice.  Wow.  Wow.  Damn.  Yeah.  What monologues?  Well, I did one for the scene contest twice, so I did a scene from Romeo and Juliet, and  I did a scene from The Tempest.  Ah.  Let's recreate that right now.  Yes.  I have no clue. 
[02:53:30]  Shakespeare seems like it's hard to watch, because British actors do it, and they always  do it with the same...  And then you see, like, Brando do it, and I'm like, wow, he seems like he's really feeling...  I enjoyed watching him do it, but I usually don't enjoy watching Shakespeare.  Well, I think sometimes people are trying so hard to make you understand the line that  they're not acting anymore.  And so I feel like sometimes if somebody like Brando is less concerned with that, and then  you can actually get the story and the feeling across better.  Your listeners are really interested in Shakespeare. 
[02:54:00]  No, it's really, because it's so out there.  It's like, I couldn't watch Shakespeare and know if I was watching it done well or poorly.  Yeah.  I couldn't tell.  But that's me.  Well, I've seen some productions that made me fall asleep, and some where I was like,  you know, on the edge of my seat.  So, my mom saw this production, there's this company in England that still does it with  all men, like it was originally done in, you know, Elizabethan England.  Even the chick parts?  Even the chick parts! 
[02:54:30]  Wow, that's incredible.  And there's this actor, Mark Rylance, who was on Broadway, like, last year, who's just  an incredible actor, and she saw him play the female lead in Twelfth Night and said it  was, like, the best performance she's ever seen.  Bizarre.  I know.  That's how it used to be.  It used to take all our parts.  Oh, man.  So now, what's your favorite Shakespeare line?  Do you have a favorite line that you read, you go, fuck, that's a good one.  Oh, God.  Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day.  I don't know, that's the first one that comes to mind.  Creeps in this petty pace. 
[02:55:00]  What does that mean?  Slow.  No, I don't know.  Oh, like, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, creeps into this, what?  Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.  Oh.  And all our yesterdays are the lighted fools the way to dusty death.  Something like that.  Is that like it's almost Friday?  Like, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you so much.  Yes, and when Shakespeare first said, happy, happy hump day.  What does that mean, that line?  It's talking about how slowly time moves, is what I thought it was.  The slow pace of time that leads to death at the end. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, always very uplifting, those Shakespeare.  Some of the comedies are fun.  Yeah.  Are they?  I got to do this one day, there's this company in L.A. that does a one-day benefit performance  of Shakespeare plays, and Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson do it every year.  And so it was really fun.  I got to do it this last year with, like, William Shatner and Martin Short and Billy Crystal  and Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, and it was really, really fun. 
[02:56:00]  It was, it was like, felt like being a kid again, because it was, it was Midsummer Night  Stream, so it was a silly comedy.  And Martin Short played Puck, and he was like, during rehearsal, he's like, should I bring  my, you know, my nude, my nude suit from home?  And they were like, oh, yeah, yeah.  I thought he was joking.  Oh, no.  He has a nude bodysuit that he's, like, drawn in a cartoon outline of, like, pecs and a penis,  and it was the funniest thing.  He wore that outfit?  He wore it.  He wore it.  He ran around the audience and just, like, came out and posed in this nude bodysuit, 
[02:56:30]  and the audience went crazy.  And he's such a genius.  Martin Short is still as funny as ever.  And so I got to do Shakespeare with Martin Short.  Can these guys all do Shakespeare, like, traditional Shakespeare?  Some of them, no, but everybody's having such a good time that you, you just, like, you  go with it.  How was Billy Crystal at Shakespeare?  He was Billy Crystal, but it was fun to watch.  And watching Martin Short make Billy Crystal laugh was a really fun thing.  I would like to see Shatner's pacing with Shakespeare.  Wow. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, it was, and they had him sing Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds in the middle of the play.  So that was, like, watching that album live, to me, it was a highlight.  He will never live that one down.  I think he's embraced it, which I guess is the only thing you can do, right?  Yeah.  He comes on here every so often, and all I do is throw Star Trek, real obscure Star  Trek references at him, and he doesn't seem to take that very well.  Really?  He kind of has fun with it, but I know he's really annoyed that I just won't stop, like, 
[02:57:30]  like, gamesters of Triskelion, and, you know...  Does he remember them?  No, that's the thing.  He's like, I don't even know what you're saying anymore.  Anthony, what are you talking about?  With that cadence he has, he's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  We've talked to Bill quite a few times.  Oh, you call him Bill.  Bill Shatner.  I call him that, even though he never told me I could.  But I wanted to sound like I was, like, his pal.  I'm Bill Shatner.  Yeah.  That sounds good.  Do you have any celebrity friends that you call different names than they're known in 
[02:58:00]  the public?  I don't think I have any celebrity friends.  I'm trying to think.  I remember Chuck Heston was a big one.  It's like, instead of saying Charlton Heston, it was like, someone would be on The Tonight  Show, and they'd be like, yeah, you know, oh, the party was great.  Chuck Heston was there.  And I'm like, Chuck Heston?  What's Chuck Heston?  The lawyer?  Chuck Heston.  Yeah.  My lawyer, Chuck Heston, was there.  Chuck Heston.  No, I don't think I have any.  Do you guys?  No.  Hollywood friends?  No.  No.  No, I don't even have a TV.  I don't think I have any celebrity friends.  No? 
[02:58:30]  Come on, you have to.  You're a celebrity.  Yes, I don't think so.  Joel McHale's a friend of yours.  Joel McHale's a friend of mine, but what am I going to call him?  Joe?  I mean, it's just Joel.  Just Joel.  Do you go to things like the Golden Globes and stuff?  No.  Award shows?  After a couple of years of your show not getting nominated for a single award, you don't feel  like going to the parties as much.  Oh, no Emmys or nothing?  No, I think we won like a special Emmy for a stop motion animation Christmas episode we  did, but we've never gotten, or we got, no. 
[02:59:00]  The sound.  No, we don't even get like sound or lighting.  No, we don't get anything.  So after a couple of years of that, you're like, I kind of feel like they're going to  ask me why I'm here if I try and go.  Oh, no.  So I stay home.  Red carpet.  Why are you even here?  Yeah, I don't know.  Thank you for asking.  Oh, wow.  Do you get invited?  I get invited to the parties.  You know, there are a lot of really nice parties, but, you know, after a while you just sort  of feel like, I'd rather go if the show is nominated. 
[02:59:30]  Right now it feels like, eh, I'd rather stay home.  Maybe this year.  Maybe this, sure.  Maybe this is the year.  This is the year.  I can feel it.  I'll watch.  Season five.  Yeah, I'll watch you accept.  Thank you.  I would be very happy to go.  That would be very cool.  We've won, the only thing we've ever won was a Television Critics Award, and we were  nominated.  I actually got nominated.  It's the first time I've ever been nominated, and the show got nominated, and we went, and  everybody's like, it's a nice award, but no one's, like, amped up like they are at the 
[03:00:00]  Golden Globes or the Emmys.  We won.  You've never seen people more excited about anything.  Oh, really?  It was like as though we won double Oscars.  We were jumping up and down on stage and looking out on the most apathetic, bored crowd of  people.  Oh, recognition, acceptance.  Yeah, I know.  And we were like, oh my God, this is amazing.  And everyone else was like, thank you so much for this award.  I'll be at the bar in the back.  So, yeah.  The one time we did win, we were way too excited.  What do you like doing when you're not working?  Guys, I'm still a nerd. 
[03:00:30]  Are you really?  Oh, yeah.  I love to go to bed around 10 p.m.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Are you a TV in bed person or not TV in bed?  I don't have a TV in my bedroom.  So, in the living room, I watch TV.  Yeah.  My favorite show is RuPaul's Drag Race, which I'm sure you guys all watch avidly.  Right?  I've never seen it, but I probably know half of them.  Oh, yeah.  You should check it out.  Your friends are doing great work.  I saw RuPaul in a Chipotle, what's that, when I was out in L.A. with my manager, but 
[03:01:00]  dressed as not as man, unshaven.  Yeah.  Nobody recognized him.  But it's odd to see that.  It's shocking.  But I was such a fan of RuPaul that even before the show was popular, I knew what he looked  like out of drag, and I saw him at a bakery once with my friend, and I was too nervous  to say anything, but I kept pinching my friend, being like, that's RuPaul, it's RuPaul.  It's like, no one else cares but you.  I'm like, this is major.  Did you get a picture? 
[03:01:30]  No.  Do you take pictures with celebrities at all?  No, I've never asked.  Jimmy does all the time.  Really?  I have a great one with RuPaul, yeah.  You do?  Yeah, we did Chelsea Handler together a few years ago, but it was Ru dressed as Ru, and  I'm like this little shrimp.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, RuPaul's very tall, yeah.  So tall.  Yeah, it's a great shot.  Well, you don't seem to be part of, really, the Hollywood community.  I don't know what's making you think that, except for the fact that I don't leave my house  and have no celebrity friends.  You're on the show.  You're on a very popular show.  Yes.  I would assume you'd be kind of on the scene a little bit. 
[03:02:00]  Kind of on the scene.  Yeah.  Kind of on the scene of getting up at 7 a.m. every morning and then being tired at 9.  That's my scene.  No scandals?  No scandals.  No.  Everyone in Hollywood needs a good scandal.  I know.  I'm really boring.  No nip slips getting out of a limo?  Gosh, no.  Nothing like that.  I feel like I always make sure to wear underwear, so.  Dee-wee's.  Dee-wee's?  Any drug driving?  Oh, I don't even see that.  Yeah, that's how close I am.  I'm like, what's that? 
[03:02:30]  No.  Is that a new drug?  No.  No, no drugs.  No, no drugs.  God.  I know.  I'm in the wrong profession.  You really got to get a little bit of a naughty side more to you.  A little naughty in Hollywood.  All right.  Okay.  That's good.  I'll work on that for 2013.  Yeah.  How happy were they moved the show back to Thursdays?  Very happy.  Yeah.  We never actually aired on Friday, so, I mean, it was, you know, it's been a wild ride being  on this show, so as much as it may seem like we're always on the brink of cancellation, 
[03:03:00]  we somehow seem to always come back, so I'm not going to rule us out.  Well, a new breath of happiness and fresh air being blown in with someone being blown  out this year, so.  Yeah.  Very good.  When's it on?  I'm sorry.  Thursday night's at 8 p.m.  Thursday night's at 8 p.m.  That's great.  Gillian.  Thank you.  Loved having you on again.  Oh, thank you for having me.  You're so lovely, and you're sweet, and you're very fun.  Oh, I love being on the show.  Thank you.  Oh, a little Sam Roberts connection.  Hi.  You like Sam?  Yeah, I love Sam.  Sam had me on the show. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, God.  That's stupid.  But first of all, it's an extension of our show, so please.  No, no, no, no.  It still counts as money.  It still counts as money.  All right.  Well, take a quick break and be right back.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  That's pretty funny.  Hey! 
[03:04:00]  Um, you're all lathered up.  You're ready to shave, aren't you?  Then you realize, oh, man, I forgot to buy blades.  Now you're stuck digging through the trash for the old blade that, um, as they say, zombied  out your face, you know, cut it all up and everything, or you're one step away from stealing  your wife's lady razor.  Ouch!  You know what that does?  This is your Dollar Shave Club moment.  Yes, Dollar Shave Club.  It's for guys who routinely forget to buy or simply hate, uh, shelling out for blades.  So here's what, um, all the Dollar Shave Club hubbub is about. 
[03:04:30]  Everyone buys razor blades, right?  Well, brand name razor companies, they nail you.  They build them with the tin blades, vibrating handles, built-in back scratcher.  You end up paying up the wazoo, as they say.  Uh, Dollar Shave Club says stop paying for shave technology you don't need.  With Dollar Shave Club, you send them a couple of bucks a month, and they deliver great quality  razor blades right to your door.  You save a fortune.  Plus, you always have flesh, flesh, fresh blades, flesh blade on hand. 
[03:05:00]  Join all the Opie and Anthony show listeners who've already found the smarter way to shave  at dollarshaveclub.com.  dollarshaveclub.com.  And that is dollarshaveclub.com.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  I need music to this.  I'm a rooter for the Hooters.  I'm a fan of the glam.  Just a knocker-docker. 
[03:05:30]  In other words, a man.  Try to look girls in the eye.  That ain't who I am.  I'm a cripple for the nipple and the part that don't get past me.  For my reincarnation, coming back and uplift bra, I want to lug them jugs and be with  women in the raw.  I want to hug them haystacks every little straw.  Bees them double Ds.  I be the chief me, squeeze them squaw.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I know I'm right. 
[03:06:00]  I'm always right.  Hi.  We're back.  Boy, what got kind of, I don't know, kind of just glazed over here toward the end of our  Gillian Jacobs interview.  The fact that there's some type of rapport between Gillian and our own Sam Roberts.  Well, I've been underestimated in this studio a lot.  And what you guys have got to understand is there's a whole world outside of here that's 
[03:06:30]  all about what's going on in the world of Sam Roberts.  No, there's not.  You don't think so?  But that upset me.  Because we're talking and I'm like, oh, thanks for coming in.  She's like, hey.  She nods and then she looks over at Sam and gives like a wave that like of knowing.  Like she knew you and gave that like that.  And I didn't say a word the whole time she was in here.  I could have just been ignored as furniture in the room.  So I'm thinking in desperation, I'm thinking, okay, maybe this is just she's saying hi to 
[03:07:00]  everyone in the room, you know, thanks to the board op guy or whatever the fuck.  Right.  And then no, it turns out she did your stupid show.  That'll call it now stupid show.  And she remembered it.  And what did she say?  Did she say the quote?  I love Sam.  Oh, boy.  How fucking many times are you going to put that in a promo that you use?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The same way she would have said I love Frappuccino or I love fries.  No.  Frappuccino.  Sounds like Al Pacino. 
[03:07:30]  You know, we've, well, we've had, we've Twittered back and forth before.  Now, Twittering back and forth.  Are you talking DMs?  No DMs.  Oh, right.  Just tweets.  Now.  But a series of tweets.  Series of tweets.  Now, were these funny kind of ha-ha tweets?  Or were they, hey, Gillian, you know, something of substance to say?  Well, no.  It was because, like, I had heard that she, there was an internet report.  I was on my wrestling website. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, shit.  Wait till you hear this.  Uh-huh.  And it says that she was at a wrestling show in L.A.  And not like a WWE show.  What?  Like one of the Supermark, like, high school gym.  Why was she there?  Wrestling shows.  I don't know, but it said she's been to a couple of them.  Wait, wait, wait.  And I'm like, what?  She's into, like, wrestling?  The promotion's, I think it's called Pro Wrestling Gorilla.  Like, it's, it's a nut.  Wow.  And so, and so I tweeted, you know, like, oh my God, this is amazing if it's true or 
[03:08:30]  whatever, and just tagged her on it.  And we started going back and forth about this wrestling thing.  Do you think she would, does she follow you?  I don't think she follows me.  All right.  That right there says fucking volumes, dude.  Yeah, I know.  There are some times where you look at somebody and like, oh, they're not following me.  Because I remember throughout the conversation, like, as each tweet went on, just checking.  Is she checking back and forth?  Like, did she hit the button?  Right.  Did she click to follow?  Right.  I don't think she follows me.  Why would she? 
[03:09:00]  Because of that cartoonish picture.  There's nothing in there that would make her want to follow you.  That's true.  But she's kind of geeky nerdy.  Exactly.  So, wow.  How many people does she follow?  Let's take a look at her.  She follows 150.  150 people.  Wow.  And who are they?  That's important to her.  And how many, how many followers does she have?  243,000.  Right.  Right.  So I'm, I'm tweeting her and she's got like 250,000 followers.  And through the muck of the 250,000, she sees my tweets.  I've seen a lot of verified check marks on people that she follows.  But there's no fucking follow, Sam. 
[03:09:30]  But that's, she only follows these verified people.  No, I see other ones.  There's a lot of other ones.  But they're all writers.  Oh.  Yeah, well.  So she's not just following people that she doesn't have real relationships with.  Okay.  Oh, is that how you justify it?  It's not justification.  I, um, God.  I was thrilled when the, um, T-Mobile girl, Carly Folks, uh, started following me.  She's a boyfriend, though, right?  Shut up.  Plus, she doesn't talk to you like she talks to Chelsea.  I know.  Or even my ex. 
[03:10:00]  How that happened is beyond me, too.  Because my ex always hated her because she thought she should have gotten the part.  Well, you know your ex is fucking throwing cock blocks up.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah.  Your ex is probably pointing out your tweets and being like, oh, this fucking guy tried  the same shit with me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pay him no mind.  Exactly.  And you're just like.  I'll bet you send a DM with LOL in it and she's like, yeah, he did.  Oh, God.  Yeah, she knows my whole fucking game, so she knows if I, oh, God.  That's the worst.  When your ex is just fucking giving up all your moves to some other girl. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  It's like, oh, does he do this?  Oh, I thought I was special.  Well, guess not.  Gather not.  Well, that was kind of nice.  She's very pretty.  Very pretty.  Gillian Jacobs.  Yeah.  She's got that dark hair now.  And you know what?  Smoking body.  But I got to tell you this, too.  I'm hoping.  Like, I was hoping this time that you guys didn't take her.  Because if I get, I think.  Oh. 
[03:11:00]  If I can get her back on my show one more time.  Mm-hmm.  Then I can get a follow.  You probably would have.  I think one more.  Because you would have confronted her on the show and said, why don't you follow me?  As a matter of fact, punch up your Twitter right now and click follow.  That would be funny if she did.  And then you checked later and you weren't being unfollowed.  How embarrassing.  Just started treating you, bitch.  How embarrassing is that?  There have been some people I've chose to follow and then just unfollowed them because they tweet much too much.  I'm sure people will say that about me.  But I go through phases. 
[03:11:30]  Like, this whole weekend I've barely tweeted anything.  But there are some nights that go by, oh boy, am I a tweeting motherfucker?  I'm a tweeting buffoon.  You haven't followed, like, famous people, but you had a relationship with them, and so they would have to see, oh.  Yeah.  And then there's some famous people that I've noticed follow.  And then I'm kind of embarrassed at some of my tweets.  I'm like, oh God, they're reading that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But I'm not going to change who I am.  No.  Hey, I'm no shill for Hollywood.  That's not me.  How about a shill for humanity? 
[03:12:00]  Okay.  Yeah, but I assume, like, I assume now, especially if, because people follow a lot of people.  Uh-huh.  And, like, I started following a whole bunch of people at one point.  Like, I used to follow, like, 80 people.  Yeah.  And then I just started, I'm in the hundreds now.  But I just don't read any of them anymore.  So what's the use of having them if you don't read them?  It's the old tree falling in a forest with no one there to hear it.  It's just like a thing.  Like, yeah, we're buddies.  I follow you.  But, and then read any of your tweets. 
[03:12:30]  You don't read any of their tweets?  Almost none.  So do you only read your mentions?  I read my mentions, yeah.  And, like.  So you follow people.  You don't care what they have to say or what other people are saying about them?  No.  Never.  See, I don't really follow people unless I want to read their tweets.  You know?  Well, you don't follow people out of being vindictive and passive-aggressive.  We learned that.  Yes, we did.  I think Jimmy learned it because we did.  All of a sudden, I'm not followed anyone.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  You follow Colin, though, again, right?  I do, yeah.  Slowly going back to people.  Yeah.  No, I agree with you, though. 
[03:13:00]  Most of them are just fucking pricks.  Colin's too funny not to follow, though.  Yeah.  Like, even if I was so pissed off at Colin, I'd still have to follow him just because he's  fucking hilarious.  But it's hard to follow somebody when you're annoyed or when there's a situation because  it's like you're seeing them every day and you're reading what they say and it just  makes you think of it.  Like, when you're not following anybody, it's not a punishment.  It's like, you know, I'm not thinking about this situation right now.  Yeah.  You must have, like, this weird relationship with a fuckload of people.  You're seeing them every day. 
[03:13:30]  You're hearing their opinions.  Because I only follow people that I know.  Mm-hmm.  I don't follow people I don't know.  No?  No.  Who would I follow that I didn't know?  I don't know.  I can't think of anybody.  How do you get pussy?  I never follow people like that.  You don't follow chicks?  No.  Yeah.  Unless I know them.  It's dangerous.  I follow, like, every person I interview.  Do you?  Like, when I just follow them before the interview.  And then I'll tweet them after the interview.  And sometimes they tweet back.  Sometimes they don't.  Sometimes they retweet.  Do you have them under D-list celebrities on your Twitter filters? 
[03:14:00]  Look, I got a retweet from Mr. Scott Baio yesterday.  I saw the pictures.  He was in last week.  It was the afternoon, though.  What'd you tweet him?  I taped it for my Sunday show.  What?  Baio.  I just tweeted that he was going to be on the show.  And then Scott Baio was like, let me retweet that.  How many followers does he have?  Wow.  He has a lot, actually.  I'm sure he does.  Does he?  Yeah.  And you love Sam, too.  He loves me.  Oh, well, he's known for that.  He has 69,000 followers.  Well.  Last tweet. 
[03:14:30]  Look at that.  Look who's quote unquote stupid cartoon face is on Scott Baio's timeline.  It was Sam's tweet.  Look.  Exactly.  It was Chachi.  All right.  And Charles.  Did you talk more about Chachi or Charles?  Well, more about Charles, definitely.  Oh, Jesus.  I have a younger skewing audience.  Do you?  I talked about his reality show that he just said right off the bat.  Well, first of all, obviously it's fake, like all reality shows are.  Oh, did he? 
[03:15:00]  I was like, really?  He started talking all about like.  Oh, thank God.  That's refreshing.  And he was like, you know, most of it's just improv.  Some of it's written.  I would write scenes.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And he goes, we would send it to the network and they'd say, where's the rest of the footage?  Like thinking that they would film hours of stuff.  And he'd be like, no.  No, that's it.  We filmed the arc.  Oh, you think it's going to be like this thing where they have to call for the good parts and like a real reality show.  Meanwhile, it's like, no, this is all you need.  It's fake.  Here's the show.  A real reality show they probably did.  Like when the Osbournes, they probably filmed and edited through it. 
[03:15:30]  That's just too much work.  Like, yeah, you know, the Osbournes was real because there was no specific storyline throughout the season.  It was just like, oh, the dogs are shitting on the floor again.  Right.  Hey, there's a story.  But all these other reality shows.  All these other reality shows.  They have definable arcs throughout the season.  How could this happen?  If it's a reality show, if things just going on.  Oh, how convenient that there's these arcs.  Who are these people?  I don't know.  We're walking by.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, no.  Geez.  Oh, no.  She's sexy.  Are those some?  I don't know who they are.  Are they employees?  They're very sexy.  How you doing, sir?  Ma'am?  Probably new.  Jesus Christ, like a Benetton ad.  Very sexy girl.  A lot of different cultures walking by that window.  And a very tall ginger guy.  That's exactly right.  Every one of them just looks like Eastside Dave.  Every time I see a redhead, I'm just, oh, it's Eastside Dave.  That's good for Eastside Dave, though.  It really is. 
[03:16:30]  He's on the status that he doesn't look like somebody.  No.  Everybody looks like him.  Yes.  He is my fucking, the litmus test of gingers is Eastside Dave.  So when you see Eric Stoltz, you're like Eastside Dave.  Eastside Dave.  Exactly.  I saw on the news before that girl, can we get that clip of that girl that went to  kick the field goal for her tryout for the NFL?  Now, they've been making a big deal of this.  Some broad, she wasn't even in football in any way, shape, or form.  She was a soccer player.  And apparently she gets an opportunity to try out for the NFL. 
[03:17:00]  This is something.  For the Jets.  For the Jets.  Why not?  This is something any guy, it would be a dream opportunity.  And they give this chick a chance.  She fucking stinks.  Spoiler.  She might have been nervous.  No, this is not a nervous kick.  This is not a, I'm injured kick.  This is not.  This is called a girl's leg trying to kick a ball.  That's what it is. 
[03:17:30]  Should we take bets on how far she kicked the ball?  Well, I saw the clip.  Let's see.  I didn't see it.  Jim, how far do you think?  274 yards, Travis.  That's my guess.  That's what it was.  It went out of the stadium.  Hey, you know what?  Better to try and fail than not try.  That's what I always say.  Really, regular Joe?  The hell do I know?  Get a girl on the field, though.  I don't know about that.  By the way, it's probably not going to help me that Jim Norton just tweeted, at Gillian  Jacobs, thanks for coming on the show.  Not Sam is enraged that she doesn't follow him. 
[03:18:00]  You're such a cock blocker.  That might actually get you followed now.  Yeah, believe me.  I know what I'm doing.  No one who knows more about celebrity follows than me.  That is true.  It's my next book.  You are the master.  The master.  What's this chick's name?  Lauren Silberman.  Lauren Silberman?  Yeah.  Is that Jewish?  Silberman?  I don't know.  Yes.  You're going to that party.  He knows soupy sales.  You're going to the Silbermans.  Remember in Fame?  The Silbermans.  The Silbermans were friends with soupy sales. 
[03:18:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I did not know that.  And they made the girl go, happy birthday to you.  In the movie of Fame?  I don't remember that part.  Doris Finsecker was her name.  You really do kind of know some things.  Yeah.  Garbage.  I know garbage.  There's a lot of things.  I didn't know that Google Maps had a street view.  But I remember Doris Finsecker's name from a movie in 1980.  Yeah.  Let's check out this wonderful kick from Lauren Silberman.  She's trying out for the NFL. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, no.  That was a kickoff.  Oh, God.  She kicked it eight yards.  It's terrible.  It wasn't a field goal attempt.  It's a field goal attempt.  It wasn't.  She was supposed to be kicking off.  Yeah.  That was a kickoff.  He ran 16 yards.  This is why girls should be allowed to try out for the NFL.  Because I'm never mapping.  Probably not with the outcome anyone expected.  All Lauren Silberman wanted to do this.  She just said you're so nice.  Instead, she made history. 
[03:19:30]  The 28-year-old former college club soccer player competed for a slot as an NFL kicker.  Slot.  Alongside dozens of men at the league's annual tryout Sunday.  The first woman ever taught a mission.  They must have laughed at her.  Oh, my God.  They must have been laughing.  She kicks like a girl.  Yeah.  Is that her?  Someone who's tall or just short.  You should, you know, go after your dreams and make it happen.  She's teeth like the pulp.  This cell phone video showing her nailing a field goal at a Super Bowl fan event. 
[03:20:00]  This is 20 yards.  Yeah.  And while the MIT graduate had never played football, she says playing video games gave her  a leg up.  And then I would use the game and, you know, try to just think about, you know, what I was  doing.  I would rough the kicker every time and just fucking molest her pussy on the ground.  Like she's pinned on the ground.  You're just grabbing at it, squeezing her tits.  Ultimately, her performance fell short.  Oh, look.  Oh.  Oh, they must have laughed at her.  It went 10 yards.  All the cameras on her. 
[03:20:30]  13 yards.  The result, she says, of an injury.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, God fucking drop that hole in between your legs.  That gaping wound between your legs.  It is really painful.  Shut up.  The story really isn't about making it or not.  What is this, monster?  No, it is.  Yes, it is.  It is about making it.  Girls can't compete.  I've met so many, you know, young girls re-testing to tell me.  Stupid red and stimpy mouth.  I'm glad that now they have a little model of someone in a role that they might not have  received.  It was an injury.  And that, to me, is great. 
[03:21:00]  How injured are you?  Can't kick more than 13 yards.  Silverman hopes the NFL scouts will look past her injury and give her another chance.  Give her another chance.  She's stunk.  Stop it.  They must have fucking howled at the girl kicking 13 yards.  Here she goes.  Watch this.  That's not even good for an onside kick.  Nothing.  Terrible.  Good for her.  You know, it's all about trying out.  Don't click this.  How fucking humiliating.  Oh, what a great kick that would be.  Oh, she's...  And here's the kickoff.  Oh, there seems to be a problem. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, that's just...  That's an onside kick.  That's an onside kick.  And then she holds her thigh like, yeah, that's what the problem is.  Ow, my leg.  There's no talent here.  The problem is just below the clitoris.  No talent had been sent.  She was a soccer player.  No matter how many times she kicks it, it doesn't go much further.  And they just keep fucking teeing up the balls for her.  She got the kick twice, and then they decided she would not get a third kick. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, man.  They couldn't even waste the time.  Yeah, because you get three kicks.  This is tryouts.  We're all good.  I think we've seen it.  I think we've seen it.  I wonder how, like, the good...  Look at the face.  That's like Mosh Girl.  Yeah, she does look like Mosh Girl.  How are the good...  Like, what are the guys that are pretty good at it that still don't make the NFL?  How far are they kicking?  By 60 yards.  I mean, they're probably kicking it just as far as any other kicker, but, you know, there's reasons you don't...  They can't aim it as well or...  Definitely further than 15 yards. 
[03:22:30]  Her face in that still would be great to cut out and pop into, like, every fucking picture.  She does look like Mosh Girl.  Eh!  Did they ever figure out who Mosh Girl was?  Not that I know of.  Lunatic.  Love her crazy face.  There's so many old internet people and things that are just long gone, like, that were so fucking popular.  Mosh Girl.  Happened out of her.  Love Mosh Girl.  That girl's like, hey, you remember Mosh Girl? 
[03:23:00]  She's one of the first.  Famous.  Memes.  Like a meme.  Yeah.  Boy, what a great face.  Oh, it's so fucking...  The other guy that's, like, dancing with his friends or moshing and...  And he's got the vomit coming out of his nose and mouth.  That's a great one, too.  You see Kevin Hart on SNL?  How did he do?  I saw the monologue.  And I only saw one sketch, the Steve Harvey sketch.  I didn't watch the rest of it.  That guy's just projectile vomiting out of his mouth and nose. 
[03:23:30]  And his buddy's just, yeah!  And then, oh wait, the World Trade Center guy's behind him.  What?  Remember him, too?  It's the guy that was on the roof of the World Trade Center.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, and obviously, best wishes to the Queen.  Queen of England.  She apparently has a stomach virus.  We're making duties.  Oh, God.  Could you imagine with that old bag's watery shits from a stomach virus?  Your Highness. 
[03:24:00]  She's fucking spraying mud.  Now announcing, Her Highness the Queen.  Bring me the golden bedpans.  Looks like Dinty Morse, too.  She needs baby wipes.  My asshole is on fire.  Skid marks on her throne. 
[03:24:30]  Her nice red throne.  They're taken into the bathroom.  She's got fucking shit running down the back of her royal leg.  Prince Philip has it all over his dick.  So you know what they were doing.  Emergency.  She has to wipe with her hat.  Her dumb hats.  Yeah.  I wonder if any shock jocks will be calling in trying to get her at the hospital.  Uh-oh.  Hey.  Oh, hello.  Can we talk to the Queen, please?  That would have been funny just to try.  Oh, my God.  Just like how bad call.  Hello.  Put me through to the Queen's room. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Ah, don't kill yourself.  Oi, oi.  Fuck them.  She didn't think we were going to get through in there.  They're back out of the air, though.  Are they both or just the guy?  I think just the guy is.  Why?  Is she the one who made the call?  She's probably still petrified and fucked up.  Is she fired or no?  She got like post-traumatic stress disorder.  They didn't fire either of them.  I thought they got fired.  No.  No?  No.  She's just too depressed.  Spend it.  Oh, get a hold of yourself.  Fuck that.  That woman was a fucking nut anyway.  Exactly.  Get back on the phone, shithead. 
[03:25:30]  Get on there.  Get back on the show.  So, I don't know what happened.  She died.  It was our fault.  We meant to make a fine call.  Call three.  She put us three.  And she killed us.  Blah, blah, blah.  What a great day.  This has been a lot of fun, everybody.  Everybody.  I have a couple of plugs.  Well, plug away, Jim Norton.  By the way, Polka Nuts, much more fun than I anticipated.  I got a lot done.  This weekend, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, making my first ever appearance in Charlotte, North Carolina at the Comedy Zone. 
[03:26:00]  So, go to cltcomedyzone.com.  Just get tickets.  But this weekend is my first time ever.  Following weekend, March 14, 15, 16, first appearance ever in Toledo, Ohio.  I canceled last year because of the special.  I am not canceling this year.  Be at the Funny Bone there.  And I'll be in Syracuse at the Funny Bone 21, 22, 23 of March.  That's the week before I tape in Boston. 
[03:26:30]  It's coming up very quickly.  Nice.  And then April 11 through 14, Caroline's here in New York City.  I'm getting some requests for that one.  People are going, oh, Jimmy's going to be a Caroline's.  I'm like, yes.  I am fucking, I better just, I'm ready to shoot.  But I got to fucking plan an opening and do other stuff.  I'm way behind here, yeah.  Is that hard?  It's really hard.  Yeah, I mean.  It's hard to put your material in order.  That is, yeah.  But I won't be able to top the Aussie opening from last year.  That is a good one. 
[03:27:00]  That's a fucking good one.  Yeah, if you get the order, I can't get the order right yet.  Like, I've been opening with one thing.  Randy Rhodes would be really good.  Yeah, but he's just turning me down.  He's like, I can do it, but I won't.  Can't get him on the phone.  But I'm fucking, yeah, I'm just getting, there's certain things I'm opening with.  I'm like, I want to get this.  I want to, you know, you just play with it and see what feels right.  Is that what you do, like, when you go out to clubs to get ready?  Like, do you change the order around and go, oh, that works better than that?  Sure.  God, it just seems like, like, how do you know?  Certain things flow better.  Like, well, this flows into that.  That's a natural lead-in to talk about guns. 
[03:27:30]  Or this is a natural lead-in.  It feels comfortable to set this up into that.  But, you know, I never know what to open with.  Never.  Nah, man.  Never.  You don't want it to feel too automatic.  Hey, thank you.  Too polished.  Too polished.  Yeah.  People are weird when they see me do stand-up.  They're like, well, we hear you talk on the radio and it's different.  I said, well, yeah, it's a different form of...  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Performing.  Yeah.  I mean, you don't know too, too many radio guys that do stand-up where you know them equally  well from both.  You know one or the other. 
[03:28:00]  But when you talk to Louis Black, when you listen to Louis Black talk, he's like that,  but he's not always.  No, no.  You don't talk to Louis where he's like, you're crazy.  Yeah, he's rarely sticking his finger in your face and yelling at you.  No, he's usually in your asshole.  Well, I prefer.  All right.  All right.  Jimmy Norton.  Wonderful.  Go see Jimmy.  I'm seeing you in April there at Caroline's.  Oh, good.  I love going down there to see my pal Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  Of course, the wonderful Sam Roberts is up next with his Let Me Try to Pick Up Famous Girls 
[03:28:30]  show.  That's right.  Apparently, you're married and way out of your league.  You're married.  So appreciate that, my friend.  I will.  But Gillian Jacobs is way out of my league, too.  All right.  You know.  That's true.  Iraq, it was a good job you did today.  Very good today.  You're a good boy.  Good boy.  Oh, Iraq.  With his little fucking children's presence and wrapping paper. 
[03:29:00]  I want a juice box.  Birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday.  Yeah, would you blow out the candle to it and the cake?  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  After Opie and Anthony live is next.  After Opie and Anthony live is next.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  Finally, I can turn my mic up to the appropriate volume here on After Opie and Anthony live. 
[03:29:30]  It was a fun show today.  Gillian Jacobs said nice things about me.  That was the end of that sentence.  How do you like that?  Oh, my God.  Right off the bat, you can call us at 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[03:30:00]  Ben in New Jersey wants to get on the phone right away.  Ben.  Hey, Sam.  I want to know why a talented broadcaster like you can't break E-Rock and find out what the hook of his horrible movie is going to be.  Well, I can't confirm that it's horrible.  You know, we don't know enough about it yet.  But I think we did figure out the hook, and the hook is that as he's going through time, the main character,  because, as you know, E-Rock is writing a sci-fi movie, and it's about a guy. 
[03:30:30]  It's a 90-minute movie that takes place over six to seven decades, and it follows his life.  And the hook is that he won't admit to, but it's fairly obvious if you listen to the clues he's given,  that the main character keeps falling through portals, like in the show Sliders with Jerry O'Connell.  And that's kind of, that's the gist of the film.  That makes a lot, I wasn't here last week, so I didn't hear it, but it makes perfect sense because Eric is a huge fan of Portal. 
[03:31:00]  And Sliders, the show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the sandwiches.  So, I mean, the whole thing works out perfectly.  Did I get it right, Eric?  Nope.  I don't believe that.  Jim in Alabama.  What did you learn, Jim?  Hey, sorry, buddy.  Dude, I was cracking up for 20 minutes.  Dan Quayle is a dickwagon?  Could you imagine being called a fucking dickwagon?  He is, he's a dickwagon.  Anthony is fucking hysterical. 
[03:31:30]  He is, thanks, buddy.  Dickwagon, sorry, it was so boring.  No, Dan Quayle.  We learned he's a dickwagon today.  Anyway, so, E-Rock, big birthday weekend for you.  You really haven't played the Wii U, huh?  Haven't played it yet.  What is Wii U?  First of all, why name a product a name that rhymes with P-U?  Yeah, you know, I thought of that, too.  As a kid, I would say, oh, I don't want the P-U anyway.  Stinks.  How come you haven't, what is the Wii U?  I don't understand. 
[03:32:00]  The main console looks like the Wii, the original Nintendo Wii, but it's HD now.  And the controller itself...  But the graphics look like cartoons.  Who cares if it's HD?  Well, most of Nintendo's games look like that.  Some of their games don't.  They have a game called Zombie U, which looks pretty good.  And they have, you know, they started carrying the Assassin's Creed line with them.  But the controller has a TV screen inside, in the middle of the controller there.  So you can play the game either on the TV, or send it to the screen, or use the actual 
[03:32:30]  screen on the controller to play the game.  Oh, so it's like a Game Boy meets Nintendo.  Yeah, so if you're in a certain part of the game, as you're playing it on the television,  all of a sudden you have to go and do things on the controller in order to affect the game.  Now, do you really still play, or is it one of those things where you liked playing  video games for so long that you just can't let go?  Like, you can't admit to the fact that you're never going to use this?  Or are you going to?  No, I love, for Nintendo, the Mario and the Zelda series are the two staples for me. 
[03:33:00]  And you can't get over them.  Every time, I have to play every one.  I like, I love those two game series.  I'll play other games that come along depending on the system.  But Mario, you cannot say goodbye.  Mario and Zelda most of all.  See, like, for me, whenever PlayStation puts out a new console, I feel like I need to get it.  Like, they announced a PlayStation 4.  Which, by the way, was not what they demoed in our office that day, Roland.  I know, but...  Do you remember when Roland was walking around here saying they were going to debut the PlayStation 
[03:33:30]  4 in our office?  But I'm making it up to you guys by giving you a free one.  All right, I mean, that's a good make good.  That works.  That works.  Yeah, we got to look at the Harry Potter storybook.  Were you embarrassed that day, Roland?  I was like, my bad.  Roland told everybody.  He walks around and he's telling everybody, hey guys, Sony's coming up here this afternoon  and they're going to give us a preview of the PlayStation 4.  And this was a month ago.  Yeah.  So we're like, Roland, they haven't announced the PlayStation 4. 
[03:34:00]  And he goes, I know.  This is the first time they're doing it.  And he goes, no pictures.  Well, you also forget it was such a top secret thing.  They were stopping here to show us before they went to the airport to go somewhere else  to demonstrate this.  Like, this was a huge ordeal.  And he goes, so no pictures.  You know, nobody can take pictures.  You could talk about it, I think.  Not sure yet.  Yeah, double check.  But no pictures.  Yeah.  And I go, oh man, this is really happening.  He goes, yes, it is really happening. 
[03:34:30]  And then the day comes, Roland, you want to go grab lunch?  No, no, no, no, no.  Sony is coming and they're going to have lunch.  And I was like, oh, what are they bringing?  Pizzas, sandwiches.  They're going to have everything.  I go, oh my God, PlayStation 4 and pizzas and sandwiches?  This is going to be great.  And so I'm sitting there and he goes, but they're not coming until 1.30.  I go, okay.  I can let my stomach growl until 1.30.  And so we're sitting there and Roland's like, oh yeah, today's the day, baby.  I'm going to be the hero of the office. 
[03:35:00]  Roland debuts the PS4 for all you ham and eggers.  Yeah, they tell certain people, you can't come in.  You can't come in.  Exactly.  No nickel and dime jabronis are going through this door.  No.  I'm just going to jabroni.  It's an invite-only list.  Yeah.  And so that little list of invite-only people, they arrive, Sony arrives, and the first thing  they do is they take the food out.  And the food's what I've been waiting for.  Because like I was saying, I don't play video games really, but there's still something 
[03:35:30]  in me that feels like I have to keep buying these PlayStations.  Because you grew up with it.  Right.  So, I'm like, okay, we're going to get some food, and then we're going to see this new  futuristic system.  Oh, yeah.  And they pull out a fruit platter.  Yeah.  And that's it.  And small cupcakes.  Oh, yeah.  And mini-fruit platter and mini cupcakes.  Yeah.  And I'm like, Roland, like I have to whisper it, because there's people who are there.  And I go, Roland, what the fuck?  And he goes, he goes like this.  He starts just waving me and shushing me. 
[03:36:00]  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry.  I go, what the fuck is going on?  And then they're like, okay, so can we plug into this TV?  And Roland's like, yeah, this TV right here.  And they pull out a brand new PlayStation 3.  And I go, Roland, that's a PS3.  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  When I saw that, I was like, they probably put a 4 inside a 3.  Right.  Because they don't want to show anybody what it looks like.  They don't want it stolen.  And they're like, here it is, Roland. 
[03:36:30]  Fiddy away, boys.  Yeah.  Take all the photos you want.  Shit on my face I did.  Here's what we're here to demo, everybody.  It's the Harry Potter PlayStation game book.  Story time book.  Story time.  It's PlayStation for ages 5 to 8.  That's what we call a show business, miscommunication.  Bro, you're not supposed to hear.  Do you hear the way, like when other people speak, do you hear them the way they hear you? 
[03:37:00]  Like, are your ears just all glommed up and they only understand Roland's speak?  No, she told me, we'll bring pizza and that.  I'm like, great.  And then when she was up there, she said, we had no time.  And I just thought, oh boy.  What?  They had no time because what?  They had to go and find an old PlayStation 3 somewhere?  Yeah.  But the next thing to her, I got a big old cheese sandwich right now.  Yeah.  And then she goes, well, to make it up, she's, I'll send you some 4s at this certain date. 
[03:37:30]  So are you going to get me one, do you think?  Yeah, because I have a big poo-poo sandwich.  Okay.  And if you don't, you know I'm going to come on here and make fun of you for this too.  Because that's, I mean, the problem is that you're like, look, they already think that  I exaggerate.  Why would you come here with a PlayStation 3?  You're fucking me up right now.  No, but she did, she promised PlayStation 4s.  She did?  Yes.  Okay, so you're going to get me a PlayStation 4?  Yes.  It's on the record?  It's on the record.  Okay, Roland's food court is on Saturday?  Roland's food court is on Saturday, you can get a PlayStation 4.  I can't wait.  You hear that, Hoot Kid?  What are you talking about?  I'm getting a PlayStation 4 from Roland. 
[03:38:00]  Is it a PlayStation 4?  They introduced it like last week while you were out in Bahrain and Dubai and Las Vegas  and all those exotic lands.  I don't know.  You sure about that?  Yeah, because Roland owes it to us because he came in here promising a month ago that they  were going to debut the PlayStation 4 in Roland's office.  And that's not what they did at all, Hoot Kid.  Not even close.  You bullshit and Roland?  No.  He said it was a show business miscommunication. 
[03:38:30]  Faux pas, as we say.  We were talking to E-Rock about his birthday this morning.  Oh, shit.  How old is your oldest?  Hoot Kid?  My oldest is 12.  You're talking about my kids?  No, my dog.  No, your oldest banana in the house.  Yes.  Your oldest kid.  12 or 13, something like that.  12 or 13.  So when it's his birthday, do you, like, wrap his gifts the night before and leave them  out?  No, I don't do that shit.  He's not.  Is he too old for it?  Yeah, I was like, go get your gifts, nigga.  Okay. 
[03:39:00]  E-Rock, how would you have responded if you had woken up on your birthday and you would  have been like, it's my birthday, and your wife had looked at you and said, so go get  your gift, nigga?  How would you have responded?  I probably would have started screaming.  Nah, kids nowadays, they just want their gift.  They don't care about all that.  It's not even Christmas.  We just give them, either you give them money or just give them the gift.  E-Rock, E-Rock's old school.  E-Rock is a child of the 80s and still lives, he lives, he lives his life today as a child 
[03:39:30]  of the 80s.  80s.  Okay, he got a, tell me if this is hip-hop.  Go ahead.  He got a Super Mario t-shirt for his birthday.  That's hot, though.  It is hot.  What?  That's gangster, yo.  Okay, okay, good.  It's not Wario, it's Mario.  No, no.  That t-shirt right there is gangster.  Yo, that is hot.  Okay, all right.  Now.  I'll wear a piece with that, a little chain with that.  You would?  Like a little magic mushroom chain?  Well, that's the black people way, but that's hot, though.  I like that.  I like the way he sticks out the hole.  The problem is that E-Rock ran down the stairs. 
[03:40:00]  He woke up first thing in the morning on his birthday, bright and early.  His birthday was Saturday.  He did not.  He woke up bright and early as the sun came up.  And he got on his wife had to give him special socks with grips on the bottom because she knew that he gets excited and they have hardwood floors.  From the sliding.  She didn't want him to slip and fall and break his neck falling down the stairs.  And last year, and you want to know what he did last year? 
[03:40:30]  No.  Last year, he jumped on the banister to slide down it?  No.  He cracked the banister, who kid?  He broke it directly in half.  Do you remember that, Eric?  That didn't happen either.  It didn't?  No, you made that up.  Oh.  Do you believe in Santa?  Who kid wants to know?  Nah.  I do.  I think he did, Robert.  You think he does, right?  There's a Mexican Santa?  I ain't no Mexico had a Santa.  The he steals.  Oh.  Exactly.  He steals or rape women.  Mexico Santa.  You can tell he's been there because, you know, it's the same thing.  There's reindeer footprints on the roof and there's a guy comes down your chimney, but you wake up with less presents. 
[03:41:00]  It's like a lawnmower on the roof.  Right, right, right.  A riding lawnmower.  No, I'm kidding.  No cookies, just tacos, some salsa.  So, E-Rock runs down the stairs.  Uh-huh.  It's bright and early in the morning.  He's got his grippy socks on.  And he's got all his gifts waiting for him with Ninja Turtles wrapping paper.  Jesus.  E-Rock, did I make that part up?  Uh, no, you did not.  Jesus.  Can I ask him a question?  Yeah.  Where'd she find that wrapping paper from? 
[03:41:30]  Where'd she find that wrapping paper from is what he asked.  Wow.  Probably Toys R Us.  That's awesome.  Or Target.  One of the two.  Yeah, so E-Rock woke up first thing in the morning and quickly opened up his gifts and  got all excited and everything.  There's a lot of kinky stuff going on at E-Rock's house, man.  You think it's a sexual thing?  I hope he doesn't have, like, I don't know, maybe like a Ninja Turtle dildo.  I don't know, like...  Uh, E-Rock.  I don't know.  If you had a Ninja Turtle dildo, what bandana would it be wearing over its eyes?  What color?  Uh, if I had one? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, what color bandana would it have?  It'd be purple for Donatello.  Oh, okay.  You know Donatello does machines.  Yes.  Donatello probably invented the vibrator.  You think so?  Plus Donatello, you know what his weapon is?  Damn.  He uses that long stick.  The bo staff.  Oh, you're right.  And that's what the dildo would be in the shape of.  Yes.  Donatello's bo staff.  The stick of dildo in the sewer?  Dirty shit.  That is dirty shit.  And it's got that toxic waste all over it that made the...  That's disgusting.  It's disgusting.  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  It's about to get that ooze on it, right?  With fucking vanilla ice wrecking, blasting.  Yeah.  You probably fucking her into the...  What was that?  He had Ninja Rap.  Ninja Rap.  Yipes.  Let me tell you something, who could.  And you're all lathered up, right?  Oh my lord, no.  It gets so frustrating.  Not over this.  Okay.  I'm talking about over the weekend, you know.  Imagine, picture this.  Saturday morning.  It's a Saturday morning for the rest of us.  E-Rock has already opened all his gifts, right?  Now, you open all your gifts. 
[03:43:00]  You gotta freshen up a little.  You're all lathered up.  You're ready to shave and...  Ah!  You realize...  Nah, nah.  Come on.  You forgot to buy blades.  Nah, get out of here.  Oh, man.  Can I shave that pussy?  Now you...  No, pussy, no.  Oh, I think...  Oh, you're talking about his chin?  His chin.  Yeah, he doesn't have to shave his pussy.  Who kid, E-Rock has what we call a natural in the vagina area.  E-Rock has a pussy?  Yeah, he does.  Now you're stuck, who kid?  And you're digging through the trash for that old blade that zombied your face out yesterday.

[03:45:00]  He's a gay guy?  No, he's not gay.  Oh.  Not that I know of, anyway.  You could ask him.  He's coming in here.  Oh, that's what he has.  I'm gonna ask him if he's gay with that last name.  He has a...  Jenks.  I'm like, he's fucking a guy.  It's not...  No.  Jenk me.  I don't think there is...  I don't think that's how gay is passed down.  It's not like Italian.  Like, you can tell by the last name.  Duke me.  Yeah.  Duke.  I haven't heard that word since third grade.  Duke him in the ass, yo!  No.  Andrew Jenks.  He has a show. 
[03:45:30]  I think it's called World of Jenks on MTV.  Okay.  And it's this show.  I heard of that show.  He's a documentary guy.  I heard of that show.  And he just goes and interviews...  He doesn't interview him.  He, like, lives with people for a time.  You know Maino, right?  The rapper?  Yeah, he smacked him.  Yeah, you saw it.  That's what I'm saying.  I know who that is.  I'm glad you're here, though.  He's crazy, too.  He did, right?  What?  He wanted to prove him.  Maino's smart, though.  Smacked the white out of him.  Because Maino is like, you're not going to come on my TV and come to my shit and make 
[03:46:00]  rap look pussy, right?  So what did he do?  The hand of God.  I think he saw Jesus, Moses, Mary.  He slapped the white off of him, didn't he?  We'll have to ask him about that when he comes in.  He'll be in here in a couple minutes.  He might not remember.  I know.  Slept him silly.  He was watching the episode.  Oh, shit.  When did that happen?  God, man.  But he got a season two out of it.  He did all kinds of stuff.  He did...  He followed around an autistic kid.  And now I think the autistic kid is like...  For real? 
[03:46:30]  Who was it?  Eli Manning?  Shit.  I don't think it was Eli Manning.  No.  I'm so mad.  The football episode was a different episode.  Okay, okay, okay.  Now the autistic kid, I think, is following him around for season two.  Eli's following him around.  Not Eli, man.  Not Eli.  He was hanging out with...  22, 24!  Hey!  He was hanging out with an autistic...  22!  He was hanging out with homeless people.  Serious?  He hanged out with an MMA dude.  He hanged out with a gambler. 
[03:47:00]  He's hanging out with all these people.  Homeless people?  Yeah, he did a whole episode where he was just chilling with homeless people.  Damn.  Yeah, he got famous, I guess, because he made this documentary where he was just chilling  in an old folks' home.  He lived there with the old folks.  Wow.  So, I don't know.  He'll be in in a couple minutes.  He'll be in some bed pants.  Watch some whack-offs.  While we're talking about movies, we had an interesting topic on O&A today.  Do you ever cry during movies?  They were talking about it.  Yeah.  Because, you know, Anthony's got his rage issues, and Jim was saying, if you cried more... 
[03:47:30]  Well, Ant's now...  He's kind of, lately, been bringing up points that are just in his head.  Okay.  You know what eugenics are, Who Kid?  Yeah, of course.  Ant's kind of thinking there might be some science to it.  Yeah.  Just enough...  I'm not saying that he's in support of the movement.  Just enough that he thinks the conversation should be an open dialogue.  And we said to him, maybe it's getting a little carried away.  Yeah, I think he is.  Maybe you need to dial it back.  And Norton ended up saying, you know, you need to be able to cry sometimes. 
[03:48:00]  Because they were talking about movies, and I was saying, like, it caused me abandonment issues throughout my childhood.  E.T. made me so upset.  Yeah, I cried in that shit, too.  Not the end, though.  You didn't cry then?  When it went up?  The beginning.  Yeah, that's the beginning.  You and me are in the same page then.  When he had HIV, you weren't crying?  No, I didn't mind.  No, I think that's Philadelphia you're thinking of.  Oh, shit.  But...  No, yeah, when the spaceship flies away, and his family leaves him, and he's just stuck in a forest with the earthlings... 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, you cry...  That fucks me up every time.  Get out of here, Sam.  When I was a kid, I used to watch that movie a lot.  Always fast forward through the first 20 minutes.  Always.  Always.  You're a bitch.  Skip right to the Reese's Pieces.  You're a fucking dyke.  What did you cry in?  You're a dyke.  I cried on Charlotte's Web.  I don't care.  Yeah, that's right.  You told me that before, didn't you?  Yeah, that's like the ultimate tear-jerking.  Yeah, for a pussy.  I'd rather be a vagina for that.  When the spider died...  Mills is looking at you. 
[03:49:00]  Everybody who works at Sirius, who's like in the hip-hop side of things, they walk by this studio like, what the fuck is Who Kid doing in there?  Bladder told me he cried when he saw Juice.  When he saw Juice with Tupac.  That's amazing.  You can bring him in, yeah.  Andrew Jenks is here.  Oh, shit.  How's it going, man?  What's up?  Welcome.  We're on the air.  Cool.  Make yourself at home.  What up, son?  You know DJ Who Kid?  Oh, man.  I should. 
[03:49:30]  This is DJ Who Kid.  My name's Sam Roberts.  How are you?  You're Andrew Jenks.  Yeah.  Welcome to the show.  And there's breaking news happening on CNBC, which I'm sure you guys are really focused on.  Yeah, we're trying to keep...  Well, that's why we have all these TVs.  We keep abreast of everything.  Right, of course.  To be as informative as possible.  Oh, shit, Obama's gay.  I knew it.  I don't have the view of the television.  Is that what it says?  He's like, I'm gay today, and I'll be gay tomorrow.  But you guys have all business.  Is this like a business show or something?  Yeah, we have Fox Business Channel, MSNBC.  I've never...  We stick to finances here. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, right.  That's what you're here to talk about, right?  Yeah, it's just the look, right?  It's just the look good, right?  You don't really care about it.  No, I mean, I don't think anybody's ever looked at those TVs before Jenks got here.  We were just talking about movies.  Like, Who Kid said...  He said I was a lesbian because I cried during E.T. when the ship flies away.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he cried...  I thought you were a lesbian anyway, but okay.  Just from walking.  Yeah, he just looked the look, yeah.  But Who Kid cried during Charlotte's Web?  When the spider died. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  My big thing is when...  What was the deer?  In Bambi?  Yeah, when Bambi's mom dies, I'd have to leave the room.  That killed you, huh?  Yeah, that was brutal.  So it's cartoons that are worse for both of you.  Yeah, I guess we have a sweet spot, yeah.  I cried and peed at the same time.  I peed and cried.  You peed a little bit, too?  Oh, man.  That doesn't seem right.  You pee when you cry?  Yeah, you had a tinkle.  You know what I'm saying?  No, I don't think either of us knows at all what you're saying.  But so far, I've got a guy that cries and pees at the same time and a dude who's a lesbian.  Yeah, well, and we just, we're here to talk about business. 
[03:51:00]  We were talking about you, too, before you came in, because Who Kid saw your episode?  World of Jenks is like, it's on MTV.  You film, I assume it's a lot of work, because you have to film like a mini-documentary for  every single episode.  Yeah, we shoot about 10,000 hours of footage over the course of a season.  For every episode last year, it was about 140 hours for 19 minutes and 20 seconds after  commercials.  What?  Yeah, it's nuts. 
[03:51:30]  It's nuts.  Do you look at the guys who did the Catfish series?  It's one fucking documentary that you're just making a series out of.  I have to do a new one every week.  Yeah, no, I know.  Maybe we should relax.  Well, you know what we do is we shoot a lot at night, because people let their guard down  at night a little bit.  And we'll just have one camera rolling, and people chill.  So a lot of times, with a lot of crews, you know, they'll start shooting at like 9 or 10,  and then they'll, you know, wrap it up at 7, but we keep going, and that's an extra,  you know, 5, 6, 7 hours a night.  Wow. 
[03:52:00]  Who Kid saw the episode?  I've seen a bunch of the episodes, but who can remember specifically the Mano episode?  That's like my best friend.  Every African-American black male from Sway onwards, I think.  Like, to this day, I was on a plane the other day, and a black dude came up, yo, man, you  took that hard.  I'm like, that was two and a half years ago.  Can we relax?  I think they used to hear it for two and a half years ago.  It was like, someone just sent me a link, it was on some rap song, and I can't remember  which.  Oh, get out of here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like the sound one? 
[03:52:30]  It was like, I'm not going to be that white boy that took it from Mano or something.  And I was like, all right, yeah.  Yeah, all my friends were pretty excited about it on the email chain.  And you're sitting there going, what I do matters, finally.  Yeah.  You truly looked horrified, though, after that smack, though.  Well, let's just, two and a half years ago, about, I would say, I approached Mano after  a little concert, and I said to him, you know, you keep preaching to me that you're a role  model, and you have a young son, and he looks up to you, but every time I see you on the 
[03:53:00]  red carpet or out on stage, you're sticking up your middle finger.  Oh, shit.  And I probably caught him at the wrong time to do that.  He was all amped up from the concert.  He was pretty amped up.  His boys were pretty amped up, so he choked me for a little bit there.  And I decided to stand back up.  I don't know what was going on.  I should have just, you know, probably left.  And then he slapped me back down a couple times.  And, hey, listen, I guess it made for good TV.  But, you know, who's worse?  Like, Mano or your camera crew?  Why nobody to help you? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, your camera crew should sit there like, yes.  They don't care.  My camera crew.  We got the commercial.  Yeah, they don't give a shit.  They're just there to film, and they're not, yeah.  I mean, I could be dying, and I think they'd keep it rolling, because, you know, it's good  TV.  I know what happened, though, Sam.  What happened?  I think he was like, yo, what up, nigga?  Did you drop an M-bomb?  Yeah, of course.  That's what I do.  That's what I'm talking about.  I call white guys lesbians and black guys the N-word, and I make television.  And you're sitting there going, hey, look, I know Mano.  It's cool.  Don't even worry about it, guys.  So, how did you, I don't understand, like, you, I was, I just got the book now, but I 
[03:54:00]  was going through it.  Okay.  And, so, here, you want to take a look at this?  I like how you said you're going through it.  That's a great way to put it.  I was going through it.  I wasn't reading it.  Well, I didn't have time to, you know.  No, I'm kidding.  Read it.  But, well, that's what, I showed who did the book.  Your face is on the cover of it.  And I'm like, yeah, Jenks.  And he goes, no, I don't know who that is.  And I'm like, well, he does a show, and he, like, talked to Mano, and he was like,  oh, that's who it is.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  That's that motherfucker.  But, so, you were doing documentaries. 
[03:54:30]  Like, you're one of these, like, annoying overachievers.  Right, exactly.  From the beginning.  Yes.  Like, you, like, it says, like.  You just said it on the head.  He, at 16 years old, created a film festival.  Right, right.  And, so, have you always just been this way?  Like, you could just, I'm going to go out and do something.  Where the rest of us were like, no, I don't know how to do that.  I always just loved using the camera and filming stuff.  So, it was like an obsession.  And that might actually be a fairly bad thing and a horrible way to live life. 
[03:55:00]  So, I wouldn't really admire it.  But, yeah, when I was 19, I hated college.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, so did I.  But then I just stayed there because I didn't have any discernible skills.  Well, I moved into a nursing home for five weeks.  Are you serious?  Yeah, I'm serious because I just couldn't take college.  And my grandfather had dementia and I couldn't really take it myself.  I couldn't wrap my head around it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And so, I decided to move into a nursing home.  We bought a couple cameras off of eBay.  And edited the 200 hours of footage in my parents' basement. 
[03:55:30]  Made a 90-minute movie.  And started randomly submitting to film festivals.  Got into a few.  And then HBO called one day.  And I was like, I swear to fucking God, I'm telling you, I did pay my cable bill.  And they were like, no, we want to buy your movie.  And that kind of started the whirlwind.  See, that's crazy.  And then, like, MTV finds you.  And they're like, we don't know what we want to do.  We want to do something.  And it said in there, they gave you, like, 50 grand to do a five-minute, like, preview reel.  Yeah.  Are you sitting there going, like, I could make a movie with two cameras I bought off eBay? 
[03:56:00]  What do I need 50 grand for?  No, I mean, you just hit it on the head.  I did.  Well, A, I paid it.  Don't tell MTV.  But half of it was, well, not half of it, but was for debt and various rent and that sort of thing.  What a car.  And then.  The rims.  But I did spend the majority of the money on shooting what I thought was going to be a feature-length documentary.  Because in the contract with MTV, I had it done so that if they didn't pick up the show, I retained the rights to the footage. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, wow.  See, I know.  Oh, so the idea is that at least you'll have this documentary.  So I was like, all right, I'm going to shoot 200-foot hours with Mano, spend, like, you know, 20 days with him, really, you know, really get a lot.  Yeah.  And then I'll edit together almost a trailer for the movie.  Oh, wow.  That'll be five minutes long, and I'll just give that to MTV.  And so they saw that, and they were like, would you want to make it 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes?  And that ended up being the pilot that aired after the VMAs that got, like, you know, 6 million viewers and every black guy in the country saying, oh, you're the dude that got slapped by Mano. 
[03:57:00]  So popular.  So you make one, your idea is like, okay, I'm going to do the, you make this one movie in the nursing home.  Yeah.  And then you're like, I'm going to do it again.  I'm going to make another movie.  And you put everything into it, and you're filming with Mano and everything.  And MTV is like, yeah, give me 13 of those.  Yeah, exactly.  Although, in between the two, I went to Japan for seven months and made a movie for ESPN about Bobby Valentine, the manager.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And so it was like the two movies they made to prove to the ESPN brass that 30 for 30 would really work. 
[03:57:30]  You know, the 30 for 30 series on ESPN.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So I did, like, the two leading up to that.  I did one of them leading up to that.  And it followed Bobby Valentine, who was the most famous baseball manager in Japan, because he was the first.  Well, A, the Japanese really look up to American culture.  B, he was the first American manager to ever win a Japan series, the equivalent to a World Series here.  Became a demigod.  There was a burger named after him, Bobby's Burger. 
[03:58:00]  Wow.  A beer named after him, Bo Beer.  Really?  A street named after him.  So, you know, people are like, you know, what was it like to live in Japan for seven months?  And, you know, usually I'm like, well, if you were to follow around Brad Pitt in America for seven months, what would you think it's like?  You know, it's like, I don't know, it's kind of a funky experience.  Yeah.  Have you been in Japan?  Konichiwa.  You've been in Ropungo, what is it, Ropungo district?  Yeah, in Yokohama, Tokyo.  I know you get mad pussy, because that's the only place white dudes get pussy.  In that area?  No, in Japan. 
[03:58:30]  Oh, in Japan in general.  America, you can't get it done.  I'm not disagreeing with you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's, I mean, well, they love the culture.  And that's part of the culture, isn't it?  You're like a white dick there.  Right, well, that's what I was implying.  I mean, I was trying to be subtle and have a little couth about it.  He's right about the baseball thing, though.  They're like fucking whores out there for this shit.  Obsessed.  It's like Western, you know, European soccer.  Did you go there with 50 Cent?  We're not allowed there.  You're not allowed in Japan?  We're banned from Japan.  Why?  Due to, I guess, the gangster culture. 
[03:59:00]  What are you talking about?  They're all pussies over there.  They don't want that gangster shit coming there.  No, I bet it's because of the weed.  I know a lot of people, you probably bought a lot of weed and you got in a lot of trouble  and then they won't let you back.  Happened to one of the Beatles a while ago.  Really?  Yeah, they're strict on the weed and I'm not here to judge you.  Be careful.  Who gets about to slap you?  I'm white.  Don't worry about you.  I'm going to take a stop.  I'm just as white as you.  Don't judge my color.  Calm down.  No, it's the gangster culture because, you know, 50 really doesn't do weed.  But then, you know, they just don't like all that fuck shit, bitch. 
[03:59:30]  They don't like the cursing?  They'll let Eminem in.  I guess if you're white and you curse, you can get in.  But if you're 50, no.  It's actually true.  When you walk around Japan and you see a black dude, everyone kind of turns around.  They're like, really?  They don't allow me in sex spots.  I can't fuck bitches.  I can't pay for sex.  Right.  Well, that's why white guys have such an easy time.  Like if there were no black guys, white guys could probably hook up with chicks whenever.  No, but it's just that we have big cocks, so we go there.  Is that what it is?  The girl will leave and go home and can't fuck 100 little dicks. 
[04:00:00]  And you fuck one big dick.  Oh, I see.  And you go home.  That's an interesting interpretation.  Yeah, yeah.  Have you guys ever heard of love hotels?  No.  No, I'm not serious.  Yeah, that is.  Love hotels in Japan.  I'll skip the very long story because I'm sure we have a time limit here.  But essentially, when you go, and I don't know this personally, it's just from what I've  heard, of course, when you go with a lady that you like or what have you, and the next  morning when you wake up in this particular hotel room, you're cheating on your wife essentially 
[04:00:30]  is the reason you go there.  A lot of these middle-aged men go there.  And so in order to come up with an excuse or to explain what's happening, you hit a button  on the phone.  And when you hit the button, in the hotel room, there's surround sound.  He's not lying.  And you hit the button.  I'm not lying.  You hit the button, and it'll say office.  And you hit it, and then all of a sudden, all these office noises go on around you.  And you call up your wife, and you go, oh, honey, my God, I've been in the office all  night.  You put up the phone, and then you hear all...  Or there's a traffic button. 
[04:01:00]  You hit traffic, and all of you hear just traffic, surround sound.  You call up your wife, honey, I'm so sorry.  Pick up your cell phone.  You know, it's insane.  They've mastered the art of cheating on your wife.  Do the women know about the hotels?  I mean, this could get a little bit controversial amongst the culture, so I don't want to just  stereotype or generalize, but from what I understand, it's almost men or women, it's  sort of accepted as long as it's not known.  Exactly.  Right.  As long as you've got a story, I'll believe it.  Just tell me something. 
[04:01:30]  And I was there for seven months, so this is, like, I'm open to other ideas or other...  I don't know.  You know, I'm just...  That's what I heard time and time again.  That's how you tackle all your documentaries.  You always go in like, look, I don't want to offend anybody.  Clean slate here.  Just do what you do, and I'm going to ask some questions.  Yeah, that's all.  I'm just asking questions.  What's been your favorite thing that you did?  Was there anything as dangerous as Mano choking the life out of you?  Oh, yeah.  That was nothing.  I mean, I've...  When I was in the nursing home, it got dangerous. 
[04:02:00]  The bed panning, the whacking off.  You didn't know that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I'm not...  The old dudes be whacking.  I lived with an animal rescuer in the C-9 Basin 15 minutes from the Miami airport, you  know, the beach, South Beach, and LeBron James and all that jazz.  And there's an area called the C-9 Basin where they slaughter horses and have dogfights,  kill all types of animals, you name it. 
[04:02:30]  And so, yeah, people don't know about it, so we did a little documentary about that.  Like the land version of the cove.  Yeah, yeah, similar to the cove, which is an amazing documentary.  And so we went there at like 3 a.m., and we would set up cameras in certain spots where  we knew they'd slaughter the animals.  What?  And then we'd have to come back 24 hours later to retrieve the footage.  And there was, I mean, gangsters surrounding you with, you know, guns and this sort of  thing.  So that was probably one of the more dangerous, more dangerous, you know, things that we've 
[04:03:00]  done.  And for the show that premieres tonight, Monday at 11 o'clock on MTV, Monday tonight at 11  o'clock on MTV.  People can actually have a Jenks Festival today, especially if you're in New York.  Oh, right.  Because at 7 tonight, you're going to be in the Union Square Barnes and Nobles.  Yes.  Signing copies of your book.  Signing copies.  I'm going to talk for like 30 or 40 minutes and go through some of these more crazy stories.  Which is great.  And, you know, kind of a lot of times people are like, who are you?  Like, who are you to be doing this? 
[04:03:30]  How did you get here?  So I kind of go through this whole story that people don't necessarily know about.  And then, yeah, we'll sign some books and that sort of jazz.  And the book is great because it's full of like pictures and everything like, you know.  Well, God forbid anyone really reads.  So yeah, 70% of it is pictures.  Well, nobody wants.  No, I mean, I didn't mean that in a condescending way.  You're talking about black people?  Nobody wants to hear you talk about how dangerous it was.  They want to see the photo.  Yeah, man.  I mean, if you go further into that book there, you'll see the pictures where I'm wearing the  camouflage and all that.  You used to be 200 pounds?  I used to be, when I was in, I went through puberty in fifth grade, I had, in sixth grade, 
[04:04:00]  I had this voice, I was this tall, and there was just more of me to feel awkward.  Yeah.  How does that, how is, like, I was really short when I was in school.  I was 6'1 in sixth grade.  I was probably 4'1 in sixth grade.  Did you know you were a lesbian yet?  No, I hadn't.  I was still struggling with a lot of things.  But is it, was it awesome?  Like, I, because when I was a tiny little lesbian sixth grader, I was thinking, like, 
[04:04:30]  oh, I wish I was 6'1.  No, you don't want to be 6'1 because, again, 6'1, 210, deep voice, people thought, like,  who, like, what is, kind of, what is this?  Yeah.  I wasn't even a dude or a guy who was an it.  Like, what is underscore it this?  Like, what's he doing?  Like, what's his, there must be something wrong.  Do we need to put him on the sex offenders list?  Right, yeah, kind of.  Like, he should be a teacher, right?  Or what's going on?  And then, you know, I just, just like I was growing out a beard, and the armpit stains  were bad, and I still didn't know what really deodorant was. 
[04:05:00]  Thanks a lot, Dad.  You know, so it's just, like, the kind of basics.  And your dad's sitting there like, he's in sixth grade, he doesn't need to know puberty  talk yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Dad, I think I have other ideas about that.  Well, that's great.  Oh, no, we still got time.  Great.  He's actually, he's kind of ill, man.  The thing about it, he doesn't want to be, like, the norm, like, you know, the normal  director.  You always wanted to be different like that?  You're, like, super different here.  Well, you know, I like telling, not to get too earnest here, but I like telling stories, 
[04:05:30]  like, for our show, we're not looking for people that want to be on reality TV.  So, like, when you put up the, you know, when you put out a blast, MTV's looking for  interesting people to be on this show, World of Jenks, everyone and their mom and their  grandfather and their sister will come out saying, you know, look at me, look at what  I do, you got to, I got to, and so we avoid all of those and, like, literally just seek  out these people and almost convince them to be, really convince them to be on the show. 
[04:06:00]  And then a lot of these people, like the people that we follow this year, they're extraordinary  individuals for different reasons, but their stories are amplified because they're going  through cancer, autism, gun violence, respectively.  And what I've learned from living in a nursing home is when I'm in front of the camera, they  see me cry, they see me get mad, they see me get upset, they see me make mistakes, and  they're like, oh, okay, Jenks, not talking third person, but Jenks is willing to be vulnerable,  he's willing to let his guard down, you know what, I will too, and there's a certain trust  level that exists. 
[04:06:30]  I got to hug him, man.  No, I mean, he's not being vulnerable right now, he's saying in the end.  I don't want to hug this nigga.  We're not on the show.  Sorry, man.  How did you, like, how do you get in touch with these people?  Like, how did you, for instance, like, how do you, do you just find Mano's people and  be like, hey, I might film something for MTV, can I just hang out with you for a month?  I talked to, um, I pitched it to a lot of, a lot of rappers, and most of them just, you  know.  Who was your, who was the guy?  They're like, unless I'm the star of the show in every episode, no, thank you. 
[04:07:00]  But you thought, like, music video?  You're saying we're making a movie about me?  No, so I go up to Mano, exactly.  And I go up to Mano, and I tell him the story, and, you know, what I want to do, and he thinks  long and hard about it.  Yeah.  And he's like, yo, Jenks, I got one big problem with this.  And usually when someone has one big problem, it's almost, it's a lot worse than a few problems,  because I can kind of take care of the few problems, but a big problem is kind of like  a line in the sand.  Yeah.  And he goes, damn, man, my one big problem is, I didn't think of this idea myself. 
[04:07:30]  And I was like, okay, well, you know what, I can work with that.  Who was the ideal guy that you wanted to do it with before Mano?  I mean, anyone that, you know, Fiddy would have been nice.  Oh, man, you would have died.  Yeah.  You would have got shot at somebody.  Our ratings would have been even higher.  But Mano is good, though, because, like, Mano is not one of these, like, he's not huge,  you know what I mean?  He's, like, still, like, actually gangster.  He's, listen, the, yeah, Mano is an actual gangster. 
[04:08:00]  He was in jail for 10, 11 years.  Right.  And when I asked him, I said, Mano, why were you in jail for 10 years?  And he wasn't yet quite opening up.  I was like, why were you in jail for 10 years?  And he thought about it.  He was like, well, I kind of kidnapped a guy and put him in my basement and just sort  of forgot to return him.  He's not lying.  But when Mano rolls through Bed-Stuy, which we did a couple times, and, like, people show  him love.  There's no, there's no, apparently Jay-Z won't show him enough love. 
[04:08:30]  So that's, you know.  No, that's Illuminati, man.  But they're both from Bed-Stuy, so.  But, like, Jay-Z and 50 Cent and those guys, they're, like, they're businessmen now.  You're not doing it, it's a different documentary when you've got one of those type of guys  than when.  That's a, that's too bad, though.  That's a shame.  And you know what?  I don't need to follow them anyway, because they have enough, they have enough attention.  You know what bothers me, speaking of Jay-Z, I've been meaning to get this out all morning,  is that because of the book coming out, Barnes & Noble, Union Square, tonight at 7 o'clock,  make sure you're there.  The, um, the, the, the kind of frequent thing that people now say is, you know, oh, Andrew 
[04:09:00]  Jenks, filmmaker and author.  Right.  And I'm like, that's bullshit, like, I'm not an author.  Just because you write a book doesn't make you an author.  The equivalent would be, when I saw an interview the other day, and they're calling Beyonce  Knowles now a filmmaker, because she had that HBO documentary.  Right.  Beyonce is not a filmmaker.  She's a wonderful, like, once-in-a-generation artist, singer.  But just because you make something, doesn't mean you're not, like, I am not an author.  I could point the webcam at myself and talk to a computer for a while, too. 
[04:09:30]  Exactly.  You could be a dyke, too.  Yeah.  I could be a lesbian, too.  Right.  Just because you say something.  Yeah.  And so I just would like to, you know, I had to get that off my, I'm not an author.  And neither is Jay-Z for that, just because he has a book doesn't make him an author.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Just translated his lyrics for the rest of us.  Right.  He's many things, but not that.  Uh, and the autistic kid from season one.  Yes.  He's coming back for season two?  The thing is, one in 88 young Americans now have autism.  When you're doing this...  Now, how, how, just think about, one in 88. 
[04:10:00]  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  And, go ahead, my bad.  Do you figure out why?  Like, how come now autism is running crazy with kids?  You know what the thing is these days is everyone has an opinion on everything, so you go online  and, like, everyone will give you their own version of why.  I know, what's her name?  Jenny McCarthy thinks, like, you can cure it, and other people think it's because we're having  kids later, and other people think it's because of certain shots we're giving.  I don't, like, that's not my job.  I'll let everyone else have their own opinion on that.  My mother-in-law thinks it's the preservatives.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And I don't think people, there is no, I don't know if there is a right answer, so I'll let 
[04:10:30]  people kind of squabble over that.  My deal is, let's get to know the kid with autism so he's no longer defined by autism,  he's defined by who he is.  Right.  So I follow Chad for a year, he's 21 years old, he is the funniest guy you will ever  meet.  I mean, literally, I watch the show and I swear you'll see that.  He is graduating from school, and for a guy who is just so used to repetition and doing  things exactly how he's used to, leaving the school you've been at your whole life is a 
[04:11:00]  huge deal.  I mean, think about, like most people, it's a big deal when you leave something.  For him, it was just mind-blowing.  So it's his senior year, he gets his first girlfriend.  Wow.  Yeah, he goes to prom, gets his first kiss on the forehead, but it's still, you know,  first kiss.  They almost break up, almost break up because he thinks, Chad thinks, that his girlfriend  Amanda has too many Justin Bieber posters, which I can see, and also watches the Disney  channel too much, which I can also, you know. 
[04:11:30]  And then his third reason was actually fairly practical in that they live an hour apart,  neither of them can drive.  Makes sense.  He doesn't like a long-distance relationship.  And so then we go on, we see him try and find a job, which was a real struggle, and then  he slept in his parents' bedroom on a blow-up mattress, a tiny little room, his entire life.  Wow.  Up to 21 years old, and so we try and make that transition to him sleeping in his own room.  It's cool, it's big stuff, I like it.  Yeah, check out the show.  It premieres tonight on MTV at what time?  11?  11 o'clock.  11 p.m. tonight.  Go to the book signing at Union Square, Barnes & Nobles at 7 tonight. 
[04:12:00]  Thanks for stopping by, Andrew Jenks.  Thank you, man.  Am I going to cry tonight when I see you at the episode?  Yeah, there's that.  Oh, yeah.  I'll actually bet money that you cried, but I'll also bet money that you laughed.  Okay.  There you go.  Ron Fezzer coming up next.  Andrew Jenks.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Goodbye.
