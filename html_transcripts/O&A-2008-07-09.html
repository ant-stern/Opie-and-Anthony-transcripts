<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts introducing themselves with crude jokes and descriptive phrases.  The conversation quickly shifted to the recent New York Times building climbers, focusing on the contrasting skills of Alain Robert and a self-promoting individual advertising a book on terrorism with a poorly designed banner.  This spurred a broader discussion of famous daredevils like Philippe Petit and George Willig, along with base jumpers.  Listener calls followed, detailing embarrassing childhood memories, primarily school-related incidents involving accidents and bullying, prompting Opie and Anthony to share their own experiences, naming specific individuals and recounting their own past bullying and misdeeds.

The show then moved to a discussion of the Running of the Bulls, focusing on the injuries sustained by participants, followed by a tangent on Anthony's childhood fur coat and his mother's advice. More listener calls described further embarrassing school incidents. The next segment tackled human-animal interactions, specifically cruel traditions, including the historical "diving horses" of Atlantic City's Steel Pier.  A caller then performed an impromptu rendition of the "Different Strokes" theme song, a song that had been referenced earlier in the show as having been sung in their school hallways by a classmate.  Crude jokes and comments were prevalent throughout this portion of the broadcast.

The following segment began with a school-related anecdote and featured Kevin, who was criticized for bullying.  In-studio guest Sam’s perceived racial background fueled speculation about his parentage and a discussion about Thomas Jefferson's descendants. The conversation then turned to frustrations with the network's lawyers and FCC censorship, citing examples like the censorship of "poop" and "gumption" and restrictions on Asian humor and jokes about topless women.  The hosts expressed a desire for younger, more understanding lawyers and recounted a seemingly futile meeting with the legal team. Sam, also a show correspondent, provided live updates on a man climbing the New York Times building, including on-the-street interviews with bystanders discussing their political opinions and views of the climber.  A substantial portion was dedicated to *Back to the Future*, including trivia, behind-the-scenes information, casting details (Marty McFly), and the original refrigerator DeLorean concept.  The segment concluded with more complaints about the network lawyers.

The next segment opened with a discussion of aging anxieties and the absence of Adrienne Barbeau as a guest, attributed to previous comments about her breasts.  Larry King's off-key "Happy Birthday" to Ringo Starr was recounted humorously. The show heavily featured clips from *Mondo Topless*, accompanied by sexually explicit discussions and jokes about the dancers.  The hosts discussed the changing social attitudes towards nudity.  The surprise announcement of Eric Logan's departure from XM Satellite Radio to work for Harpo Productions followed, provoking speculation and jokes about his new role and the potential impact on the show, given the upcoming merger. The segment continued with discussions about Logan's departure, more *Mondo Topless* clips, and interactions with callers, including relentless mockery of a caller, Tina, for repeatedly requesting mentions of Adrienne Barbeau’s appearance on *Quincy*, culminating in a bizarre, sexually explicit recounting of a *Quincy* episode involving a corpse.

Further discussion of Eric Logan's departure dominated the next segment, filled with profanity and sexually explicit jokes.  A phone call with Don Wicklund, a colleague of Logan's, initially unconcerned, later expressed sadness, leading to the hosts jokingly "firing" him.  A call from their agent, Bob, who was initially unaware of Logan's departure, added to the conversation, eliciting shocked reactions and further sexually suggestive comments. This was interspersed with more off-color jokes and homophobic slurs.  A caller, "Jimmy," detailed graphic experiences with cuckolding, sparking further sexually charged commentary and a discussion with Don Wicklund on the subject. The segment ended with jokes about a future prank involving ping pong balls and speculation about Bob's personal life.

The final segment heavily featured morbid humor regarding George Harrison's death from cancer, including repeated jokes about his head and cancer, and riffs on Beatles trivia and John Lennon's "bigger than God" quote.  The closing involved a nonsensical exchange about alternate timelines and *Back to the Future*, more George Harrison jokes (referencing his head as a "chicken pot pie"), and mention of Eric Logan's disabled email account. The show ended with an extended "Different Strokes" segment interspersed with random phrases and a brief MySpace self-promotion by a DJ, noting they went fifteen minutes over their scheduled airtime, seemingly in relation to Eric Logan's departure. No guests were explicitly mentioned beyond the regular hosts and those who called into the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Out of any other medium, have to be nice.  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it. 
[00:00:30]  All right, how's it going?  It's going quick.  Tor Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea.  All right, this is a bust, lesbians.  We're going to smell all of your fingers.  If it smells like a day at the fishing hole, you're under arrest.  We're blithering idiots. 
[00:01:00]  That's fine, though.  I want more of my it is C, it is C, it is C.  I love you guys.  I'd suck all your c*** up all day.  Fine.  I think that's an endorsement.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, this guy.  Yeah, we start with this guy.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Yes.  We'll get into the festivities in a little bit.  But here in New York City, we got another dope. 
[00:01:30]  Actually, so far we've had two dopes and one professional.  That has, or that have, climbed the New York Times building here in New York City.  Yep.  This morning was the third guy.  Might want to look this up online if you really care, but there was the professional guy.  What was his name again, Jimmy?  You like him.  He climbs without anything.  Just using like the fingertips and his toes. 
[00:02:00]  Alain Robert.  Alain Robert.  Alain Robert.  Alain Robert.  He knows what he's doing.  He's climbed structures all over the world, and he's a professional.  He makes it look easy.  Then he had another guy do it the same day as Alain Robert.  This was about a month or so ago, right?  Well, this morning we get into work, and a couple of our guys are not here because they're  down at the New York Times building climbing it.  No, of course not.  We should at this point.  We would get some promotion for the radio show. 
[00:02:30]  It seems like it's an easy climb, too.  Yeah.  They put up some lattice work, and it's easy to climb, apparently.  So the third guy started climbing this morning.  He got up to the, what, 11th floor?  Yeah, about that.  11 stories.  And he took out his, quote, he unfurled, you gotta say quote, unfurled, quote, his banner.  Yeah.  That he wanted the world to read. 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  And he placed his, quote, banner on the 11th floor?  Yeah, he's apparently got a book about terrorism, and he wanted to advertise it, so he scales  the New York Times building right when all the morning news shows start.  Very calculated.  Not a bad idea for self-promotion.  Wonderful idea for a radio show.  Oh, oh.  But perhaps.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  When you're unfurling your banner.  Quote.  Yes.  Your banner.  It should probably be a little bigger than an 8x10 sticker.  You see this piece of paper here, Jimmy?  That we have some show prep on?  11 stories up.  This was 11 stories up promoting what he needed to promote.  And we would give him the free promotion today, but we couldn't read the damn thing.  Put it this way.  It was too small, so you lose.  Put it this way.  The news cameras on the ground zoomed in on it, and you still couldn't read it. 
[00:04:00]  And you know news cameras now can zoom in a mile away.  They could show nose hairs if they want.  You couldn't see it.  They showed a poor cop that had to climb out and take it down.  Yeah.  And it was just, in two little swipes of his hand, he just tore it.  Yeah.  And ripped it down.  This banner, this quote banner fit in the cop's hand.  Yeah.  This guy's an idiot.  He really is an idiot.  He did everything perfectly.  Got the timing right with all the news channels, because all the news channels here, 
[00:04:30]  are featuring him on the news.  And he blew it.  Yeah.  Blew his opportunity to really promote his book, which looks like some kind of kooky book.  Yeah.  Bin Laden's plan.  Bin Laden's plan.  Yeah.  The project for the new Al-Qaeda century.  Yeah.  So is he for Bin Laden or against Bin Laden?  What's his deal?  I think he thinks he has some inside info. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, does he?  He said he's been reading about Bin Laden since 99.  Yeah.  Well.  But, you know, is this anything new?  Bin Laden doesn't like us?  I don't know.  Really?  But when Robert...  Robert...  Got to say the French words like that.  Robert...  You know, when he climbed, it was cool.  We all checked it out.  And now we got this dummy, and they arrested him.  And now they're talking here in New York that they want stricter, what, laws passed, and 
[00:05:30]  they're going to have stricter fines.  Oh, for climbing?  Yeah, they don't want people climbing buildings anymore, because this dope from this morning  is going to ruin it for everybody.  You know?  Yeah.  You need that George Willig character every once in a while.  You need Robert every once in a while.  Who else, Jimmy?  Who else?  Who's the guy that, like...  There's Willig and Robert and the guy Spider Dan, but he used equipment.  Right.  What about Petit?  Fully Petit.  We have him coming in.  Spider Dan.  Yeah, Spider Dan. 
[00:06:00]  Sounds like Spider-Man, only with Dan.  Well, yeah.  Yes.  He, um...  Philippe Petit was the craziest of all.  Yeah.  The craziest of all.  We're obsessed.  Jimmy and I are obsessed with Philippe Petit, and I'm so bummed that he didn't do his Twin  Tower thing when, like, we all had video cameras.  I know.  Because all there are is, what, photos of this guy, this insane...  Well, he's not insane.  He's a tightroper, and he knew exactly what he was doing.  But he lays down in the middle of the Twin Towers on a tightrope. 
[00:06:30]  Oof.  Yeah, he went back and forth like six times, eight times.  Yeah, and he laid down at one point to kind of look at the heavens.  Yeah.  And look at birds flying above him.  I got goosebumps just talking about it.  Yeah, he laid down on the wire, and there's actually one point where he's walking across  the wire, and he kind of just stops and squats down and looks to the ground.  Just looks down.  To the ground.  He looked down.  He goes, I wanted to see this.  I would never see this again.  With nothing under him except a piece of cable.  What if all of a sudden you snap out of it and you go, I don't know how to tightrope 
[00:07:00]  walk?  Yeah.  I'm stuck here.  Help.  Yeah.  Help.  You Google Philippe Petit, and some of the pictures are just horrifying.  Just horrifying.  But anyway, you got him, and then you got the guy that jumps.  Who's he?  They caught him at the Empire State Building recently.  I don't know his name.  Yeah, but...  And there's a case going on here in New York City.  Which he should lose.  He takes a parachute.  Well, he was on the other side of the railing.  He was ready to go, and some cop was able to grab him. 
[00:07:30]  Yep.  And he's screaming.  The video's great, because he's screaming, let me go, let me go.  You're going to kill me.  You're going to kill me, yes, because I know what I'm doing, and I need to jump properly.  He was afraid that what was happening was, when the security guy grabbed him on the other  side of the fence, and I think cuffed him, so he couldn't jump.  But he said that you have to cut this off, because if his parachute deploys, it will  rip me up in half.  Because if he's cuffed there, and he was afraid of his parachute...  Oh, my God, really? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And he's just dangling, and getting pulled, and your arm rips out of its socket.  That parachute would have ripped him right off the thing.  That would be great.  But I think they should get fined for that, because if your parachute doesn't open, even  if you know what you're doing, you could have a technical malfunction, you're going to  land on somebody.  Sure.  I love these guys, though.  You can't make it a major crime.  You really can't.  Because every once in a while, as human beings, we need some excitement like this.  All of a sudden, you wake up one morning, and you're like, he's doing what?  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  You need that in your life.  I just wonder, how many people have been hurt by people that have done this?  No one.  Yeah.  No one.  And what's up with the New York Times building?  They said they were going to make it climb-proof, or whatever.  Less attractive to climb.  Yeah.  By putting what amounts to a ladder in front of it.  Right.  That's what they did.  Oh, really?  A giant ladder.  There's a sign now that says, do not climb.  Yes.  Danger.  Do not climb.  And yes, someone's saying, don't forget Turk 182. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Anthony had some fine Turk 182 jokes in the office today.  I was just saying, it was not quite Turk 182 when he pulled out his little 8x10 sticker  and put it on the side of the building.  Turk 182 is a quite rare movie, but there you go.  There's the reference today.  So, we wake up with that this morning here in New York City.  What's going on in your town?  Give us a call.  877-212-ON-A.  Empire State Building Base Jumper, two years ago, Jeb Corliss? 
[00:09:30]  Is that the...  Yeah, but he's got a name.  Jeb?  He's got like a name, like the Human Fly, or the...  He doesn't go by Jeb.  No.  For the jumper?  Yeah.  He's got to have a fancy name.  These guys got to have fancy names.  Jeb is not a fancy name.  No.  That's a silly name.  You need kind of like a superhero climbing name.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace. 
[00:10:00]  Brooklyn.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you, sir?  I'm standing and breathing.  Hey, I would have turned around.  When that cop turned around and grabbed me, I would have looked at him and said,  listen, you either let me go or you come with me.  Those are your two choices.  Yeah, but the problem was the cop was on the other side of the railing.  Yeah.  Holding on tight.  And the Empire State Building has that railing where it's like curved and stuff,  so it's really tough to get over.  Yeah.  The guy could not have pulled the cop over.  He was on the outside.  Picture yourself in jail, and you're outside the bars. 
[00:10:30]  The other side is the guy inside the bars.  You could not have pulled him through.  Yeah.  That wouldn't have worked.  Hey, by the way, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  I hit 21 years Saturday.  Oh, congratulations, man.  Thanks, bro.  Good boy.  Later.  See you.  Bye-bye, Brooklyn.  All right.  Let's see.  21 years without a drink or truck in my party.  But no, that's the way to say it.  Not Voss.  Yeah.  Who makes it so dramatic?  Yeah, this guy that got caught at the Empire State Building.  I used to watch this show, Stunt Brain.  Stunt Junkies on Discovery.  He was the host.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Marcos from Yonkers.  What's going on?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Now, I was calling in.  You guys were talking about the high wire.  Did you guys ever see that video?  It was a family that this guy, he was like seven years old.  Carl Wallenda.  Sorry to interrupt you.  Carl Wallenda, that guy he was talking about.  Yeah, yeah, him.  But he ended up dying and falling to his death.  Yeah, where was that?  Like in Puerto Rico or something?  In Mexico?  Mexico, somewhere down there.  No, it was in Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico?  Puerto Rico.  Yes.  He made it to the middle of it. 
[00:11:30]  He tried to sit down and he just fell.  Yeah, he was, it looked like it was windy, right?  Like he's walking.  It's exactly what would happen to any of us if we tried it.  Oh, my God, yeah.  And the Flying Wallendas, I mean, they were very, very famous.  Yeah.  They did this all over the world.  Didn't he die in front of the rest of his family or something?  In front of the whole family.  Yeah.  And I remember Robert Klein had a very funny bit about how the Flying Wallendas were just  bent on killing their whole family.  And they're just so proud of somebody when they die.  Yeah.  It was very funny.  They would do like pyramid things on the ropes, too. 
[00:12:00]  Like they'd have the whole family out there and do some kind of a pyramid.  That's insane.  Yeah.  It's like, let's just risk the entire family's life here.  Right.  Let's take them all out at the same time.  He's walking.  I think he was like 20-something stories up.  I mean, he wasn't as high up as, you know, nearly like, but way high enough to kill you.  I hear you only need five, Jimmy.  Yeah, I think so.  Something like that.  He's in the middle.  And all of a sudden, you could see him teetering.  Yeah.  And this guy's an expert. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, the balance stick with him.  The wind was blowing and he starts teetering back and forth.  And you're like, oh, boy, he's in trouble.  Oh, boy.  And then he's going, he actually drops the stick in an attempt to sit and grab the rope.  Yeah.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, now that's all, that's ringing a bell.  He dropped the stick.  It kind of bounced.  Yeah.  And then he, he tried to grab the cable and just, yeah, didn't quite make it.  YouTube Carl will end it.  That should pop up under LOL.  I don't think.  Hello.  I don't think Iraq is awake there. 
[00:13:00]  LOL.  Why don't you want to switch off the photo?  We're done with that photo.  Yeah.  Iraq, your excuses stink.  Who do you think you're talking to?  Iraq, you'll leave, you'll leave the picture up too long.  Yeah.  The Empire State Building guy, we moved past.  Why would you want, why would you want that picture still up there?  Things rotating.  Oh, he acts like this is just some giant thing for that man.  Right.  That was 1978 that happened.  Really?  Yeah.  It was in Puerto Rico and he was 73 at the time crossing the wire. 
[00:13:30]  And the family website says it wasn't because of the wind.  It was two misconnected guy ropes that made the main rope unstable.  And that's what.  Oh, so it started shaking a little bit.  Yeah.  A little oscillation of the cable.  Older than McCain.  And he was crossing that wire.  Oh, see.  Imagine McCain up there.  I don't know why I said that.  I don't know.  I was thinking.  But the image kind of made me chuckle.  Oh, okay.  I think because he wouldn't be able to hold the.  Couldn't hold the pole up. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  I don't know.  Those arms of his.  See, we can make anything funny, I guess.  Give us two things.  We'll make it funny.  Hey, we're doing improv.  Improv.  Got to give props to the person we just trashed.  I was laughing about that all day yesterday.  What, the improv thing?  Steve.  Steve's improvs.  Yeah.  Yes.  My favorite new thing is intern Bulb.  Hey, Bulb.  Is Bob in today?  No, tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow.  Make sure he's.  No, rosy cheek, Bulb. 
[00:14:30]  Make sure he's on this side of the show tomorrow so we could really exploit Bulb.  Of course.  Bulb.  Ah, what was I saying?  What was I saying?  What was I saying?  What was I saying?  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock.  We just trashed him, but now we've got to give him props.  We do.  Can you find this thing or what?  It's not showing up.  It'll show up.  It's YouTube.  Everything's on YouTube.  Look at Jimmy in his face.  It'll show up.  It'll show up.  I'll end a fall.  What do you have?  It's showing something about Georgia.  Tyro Walker does headstand on high wire. 
[00:15:00]  He walked across a canyon in Georgia.  Yeah, he did a lot.  Well, these guys did a lot of that stuff.  All right.  Back when people cared.  Yeah, let's move on.  And if he finds it, he finds it.  Got to give props to E-Rock.  What do we search on YouTube?  I know we'll put the video up on onaradio.com, but remember when we had E-Rock ask CBS FM?  They broadcast literally right over there.  Mm-hmm.  E-Rock from Opie and Anthony annoys WCBS FM in New York.  That's a great search right there. 
[00:15:30]  E-Rock from Opie and Anthony annoys WCBS FM in New York.  Just type that in YouTube if you have a good memory, and you'll get to see the video I'm  about to mention.  But they broadcast literally right there.  And someone on comment said, wow, they weren't lying.  They really do broadcast very close to Opie and Anthony.  They were doing their July 4th countdown, what, A to Z catalog thing.  And E-Rock walked in, asked them what song they were up to.  They said what song they were playing. 
[00:16:00]  And E-Rock basically said, who gives a blank, cleaned it up for the radio, and slammed the  door really, really hard.  Well, that video is now up on YouTube, and will be linked on onaradio.com.  Yeah.  It's E-Rock from Opie and Anthony annoys WCBS FM in New York.  All right.  You got the video?  Oh, is that him falling?  No, it's him doing a headstand.  Damn it.  Doing a headstand.  I want to see him plummet to his death.  Yeah, I don't, maybe they got that off, uh, off the internet. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, that's not him falling.  Why would you do a headstand on a tightrope?  I don't know.  Uh, because it's impressive.  Yeah.  I don't know why you'd do either of those things.  I would never do a tightrope, and headstands are just silly to me.  Cool.  Here's the clip of...  You're feet four.  Why don't we just hire our listeners to be producers?  Here's the clip of him falling.  Oh, yeah?  Where?  Uh, it's on Instant Feedback.  Kent, the movie guy. 
[00:17:00]  Oh.  We know Kent.  Uh, all right.  You find it there now, E-Rock?  Rope walking accident.  Oh, boy.  All right, here we go.  Oh, this isn't...  We'll link this up on onaradio.com.  Here he goes.  He's, uh...  Oh, the tightrope is wobbly.  It's a little wobbly.  Oh, yeah.  The pole...  Oh, now it's shaking.  It's starting to oscillate.  Oh, my God.  He knows he's in trouble.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  The pole is going back and forth.  He's trying to go down now to lower his center of gravity and get on the cable. 
[00:17:30]  All right, he should have saved it right there.  Oh, he falls.  They don't really show him falling too much, huh?  No, but he kind of sits and then clumsily...  He has the amazing balance until he goes to grab the wire that he's just a fledgling old man.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Then he turns into that old geezer.  Yeah, we'll get this up on onaradio.  Yeah, he tries to lower himself down and just, uh...  Oh! 
[00:18:00]  Oh!  Oh, there he goes.  They do show him hitting the pavement.  Yeah.  That's over, Johnny.  All right.  There was about a good second there for him to go, wow, I really screwed up.  You're kidding.  And then just crack.  Yeah, you get that wobbly rope like that.  We've all tried to do the balance thing, and then it's like it starts to wobble a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  You just can't control it.  Woo!  All right.  We'll go to the phones next.  877-212-O-N-A. 
[00:18:30]  Come on!  Opie and Anthony.  Bitter, angry motherfuckers.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy's a realist.  You're a racist.  Fuck!  And I'm clueless.  Hey, good morning, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  What?  We like to learn on this show, right? 
[00:19:00]  No.  I just learned something.  Well, we like to learn stupid things.  Right.  We don't like to learn, like, about European history.  No.  Yeah.  Or quantum physics.  Learning's stupid.  For the most part, it is.  School learning is stupid.  Think back to high school.  Mm-hmm.  What'd you learn?  I learned about Mesopotamia.  All right.  What could you tell us about Mesopotamia? 
[00:19:30]  It's the cradle of civilization.  Is it?  Yeah.  And what are you going to do with that knowledge now?  I want to visit Mesopotamia someday.  Right.  I always thought that meant that someone had a lot of Mesopotamia.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  I like turtles.  Yeah.  Well, this is what I learned today.  As Jimmy continues to crack himself up. 
[00:20:00]  The running of the bulls?  It's more than one day.  Who knew?  Who wants to do it more than one day?  I thought they did that dumb thing once, and then they moved on.  But no, they're so obsessed over there.  It was like a week.  What?  It's such a popular thing to do that they made it longer than a day?  Do we know the history of the running of the bulls?  I'll find it.  Well, here on the Opie and Anthony Show, we're keeping track.  And here's what we got.  Yesterday, day two of running of the bulls, a man was gored. 
[00:20:30]  That means something went up something.  Yeah, yeah.  A horn got through him.  Sure.  Man gored and four injured in day two of running of the bulls.  Stats are way down.  Day one was a very impressive day for the bulls.  Yeah, I think it falls off after day one.  Day one is really your big injury day.  Yeah.  The bulls did all right on day one.  Day two, not so good. 
[00:21:00]  Day one, zero people.  Got the horn up the you-know-what.  But 13 were injured.  So running of the bulls, two days down.  Maybe this is it.  I don't even know.  Are they going to do it again today?  You got 17 injured so far.  So who's winning that?  Hot shoe.  Bless you, Anthony.  Thank you.  Bless you.  Oh, my nose is itchy.  Yeah, but we're not fans of the whole running of the bull thing.  Who made it popular?  That writer there.  Ernest Hemingway. 
[00:21:30]  Ernest Hemingway made it very popular.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He made it very romantic.  Yeah.  With the matador.  Meanwhile, it's not.  No, it's-  Just let these beasts loose in the street to chase around a bunch of dummies.  That's disgusting.  And I'm not even an animal rights activist.  I like my steak.  I like my leather shoes.  All that crap.  Oh, yeah.  I'll wear a fur if it comes back in style.  I don't know.  Anthony used to wear one back in the day.  Well, you know, I didn't want to.  Had to. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, he bought it for me, and it was either that or freeze.  Yeah.  If Joe Namath comes back and just starts wearing furs and makes it cool, maybe I'd wear one.  I don't know.  That's what my mother said.  She goes, Joe Namath is wearing a fur coat.  Yeah.  So don't you worry about, you know, going to school and having people call you a sissy  because you're wearing a fur coat.  Did they?  And guess what I did?  You wore the fur coat.  Yeah.  They called you a sissy, and you went home and cried, and then your dad yelled at you for 
[00:22:30]  crying.  Of course.  You win.  Of course.  It's the story of my life.  Hence, lucky us, we get to hang out with the tough Anthony.  With the tough outer shell Anthony.  Protect, protect, protect, protect, protect, protect.  Defend, defend, defend.  Protect, protect, protect.  Don't show any emotion whatsoever.  Daddy taught me that.  You know the horror that I felt when mom came home with that god-awful fur coat? 
[00:23:00]  Like, all my friends at that point were wearing, like, the Kenny from South Park snorkel jackets.  Those were very in back then when I was a kid.  And I expect mom to come home.  It's, you know, back to school time.  And she's going to come home with a jacket for me.  And it's a fur coat.  This gray fur.  And I just started crying right then and there.  I was like, I can't wear this to school. 
[00:23:30]  They're going to make fun of me.  And she goes, oh, Anthony, go scratch your ass.  That was a big one.  Go scratch your ass.  Sometimes she'd just say, go scratch.  Why was the Kumey is obsessed with ass play?  It was just scratching it.  For some reason, you had to scratch your ass if you were upset with anything.  I've never heard that.  Oh, go scratch.  I've heard it over the years doing radio with you.  But outside this show, I've never heard scratch your ass.  Oh, that was a big one in my household.  Why go scratch it?  Why not, since you're there, just go ahead and scratch it. 
[00:24:00]  Just start scratching.  I believe it was, get off of whatever you're on right now, whatever subject you're on,  and do something more important, like scratching your ass.  See, it's some kind of sarcasm thing.  You know, like, oh, go scratch your ass.  You'll be making more of a point than you are crying over my fur coat that I just bought you.  Sure.  So that's when she brought up Joe Namath and said, well, Joe Namath, if they make fun of you,  you tell them, Broadway Joe, Joe Willie Namath of the champion New York Jets wears a fur coat. 
[00:24:30]  So they're not completely, not understanding child playground psychology.  No, not understanding there's a drastic drop off between superstar Joe Namath and little skinny arm Anthony Cumia.  Oh, forget it.  A little emaciated kid. 
[00:25:00]  With a fur coat.  With a fur coat.  And the first day, I stepped off of, out of, I walked to school at that point.  I didn't take the bus.  So when I stepped into the schoolyard, it just started.  Hey, hey, hey, Cumia.  What's that you got on?  Oh, Joe Namath wears one.  It's the first thing out of my mouth.  Because I had to defend myself against it.  And they didn't care.  Like, I never said it.  They were just calling me every derogatory term for a homosexual that they could think of. 
[00:25:30]  And kids could think of a lot.  The G one?  Everything.  The F one?  What, gay?  F?  Yes, the F one a lot.  The Q?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fruity?  Fruity?  Not so much Fruity.  They string them together and call you a queer gay?  You're a gay queer?  Yeah.  All, every one of them.  How about the CS? 
[00:26:00]  No, no.  They were a little too young for that.  But it hurt.  I was very hurt by that.  You meant, Cumia Scratcher.  And I, uh, me saying go scratch your ass to them didn't help either.  No.  And I believe some of the bigger children decided to just punch me.  Yeah.  Because I was wearing something silly.  Yeah.  So what you have to do is walk up and punch that person.  That's what kids do. 
[00:26:30]  It was Lord of the Flies and I was Piggy.  Kids are brutal.  Kids just suck.  They really do.  There's no sympathy.  There's no thinking things out.  It's just this instinctive, let me destroy this person.  Yeah.  Uh, because they're different in some way, shape, or form.  There you go.  I did the same thing to poor, fat Patrick Fulham.  What'd you do to Patrick Fulham?  Patrick Fulham was a fat kid that made the funny face when we punched him in the stomach.  Oh.  So we used to punch him in the stomach all the time. 
[00:27:00]  If he just didn't make the funny face, we never would have punched him.  But we had him.  And then Bellin.  This girl's name was Bellin.  Bellin Cornell.  She stunk.  She stunk.  She might be listening.  You stunk.  She smelled so bad that the teacher took her out of class and had to address the classroom  in some way where she thought it was going to help by telling us, look, she probably has 
[00:27:30]  a medical problem.  She sent her to the nurse and said to us, Bellin probably has a medical problem.  So, you know, be nice to her.  Don't be mean or talk about it or anything.  And the second she came back in the room, just, you stink.  You smell.  Would you go in your pants?  And just kids.  They're such animals.  As long as we're sharing.  Oh.  Rosemary probably listens to the show. 
[00:28:00]  My mother.  No.  Oh.  From Washington Drive School, grammar school.  We all know that you used to go in your pants.  Yep.  We all know it.  We also know that you used to strike out and kickball.  Strike out and kickball.  That is true.  That won't get you made fun of.  And even though you became very, very hot in high school, it was tough to get past the  fact that you, you know, did what you did in your pants in the middle of class. 
[00:28:30]  And you had to awkwardly leave.  And the janitor had to come with the sawdust.  The sawdust in the broom.  And the teacher would have an extra pair.  For you.  Just in case.  Just for you, Rosemary.  We had some girl do that in the cafeteria.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like people are talking and there's this little chatter going on.  A little chatter.  And then you just heard the sound of somebody as if they took a large glass of water and  started just pouring it on the floor. 
[00:29:00]  And everybody kind of looked around and turned.  And this girl was just sitting in her chair.  And, and you know how the, uh, some of the school chairs have those three slots where  your actual seat is.  It was just pouring out of there.  Oh, really?  And hitting the floor.  And everybody just, a few people were like, oh, but everyone was just like, ah, ah, ah,  ah, ah, ah, and pointing.  Let's play Call Out Your Old Schoolmates today.  Oh.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Who's, who was pukey?  Who upchucked and, uh, didn't, uh, didn't live it down for years?  I'll do a good one.  Camille?  Everyone knew you had amazing boobs when you were 14, 15 years old and we all stared.  Every single one of us, you were the first one to develop and we all took notice.  Yep.  There was a girl named Jerry.  Jerry?  With an I?  With a G.  It was G-E-R-R-I, I think you're right.  All right. 
[00:30:00]  I wasn't going with Jerry with an I in the beginning.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  And she came back from summer vacation and was just, I mean, she had huge breasts.  And she was a tall girl, too.  She looked like she did not belong in the school.  She sprouted.  Yeah.  And I decided I was going to comment on her breasts.  So I said something pretty nasty. 
[00:30:30]  I think I used the T word for breasts.  Sure.  And, yeah.  And she kicked me in the groin so hard.  I went down on that hard, cold school hallway floor.  That's exactly what her dad taught.  Oh, exactly.  The dad sat her down and said, look.  Absolutely right.  He's not stupid.  He's like, oh, my God.  She's the person to develop.  Guys are going to start saying.  And she's going back to school in September.  I'm going to have to have a talk with her.  She got some kickboxing lessons during the summer. 
[00:31:00]  And if anyone says anything or, God forbid, touches you, you turn around and you kick them  right here, you probably got, well, I got this big padded cup for her to practice on.  Yeah.  And now kick daddy.  Kick daddy.  That was great about the girls that were developing.  They didn't know how to, like, they didn't know how to live with their new boobs.  What, did it get in the way of, like, their writing? 
[00:31:30]  Well, now you see, like, you know, a well-endowed woman.  Yeah.  She knows how to work her boobs because she's had them for a long time.  But, you know, you go from flat-chested to wah in one summer, they're getting in the  way of everything.  And they just don't know how to live with them yet.  Yeah.  Which is a lot of fun for you, the guy.  Well, since we're calling out former classmates, I'd like to address this girl, Pam.  Sure.  From Elwood Junior High.  She was president of the IBTC. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Which, of course, is the itty-bitty committee.  Mm-hmm.  And she was the opposite end of the spectrum, completely flat-chested for, um,  uh, I believe the entire, like, school career, even through high school.  Yeah.  And then, I believe on classmates, um, dot com, she, uh, she turned up and had gotten implants.  Really?  To compensate for her years of being called, you know, the president of the IBTC. 
[00:32:30]  Sure.  And, um, they're just giant.  They're giant cans now.  Overcompensating?  She was really skinny, too, and now she's, like, kind of plump.  Sure.  With giant cans.  Sure.  And she bleached her hair.  She, like, wanted to turn into a different person, I think.  Sure.  Hysterical.  And we ragged her relentlessly.  Well, if you want to continue.  Why not?  Uh.  Plenty of ammo. 
[00:33:00]  Uh, David, we all knew.  Oh, no.  You weren't fooling anybody.  Oh, no, really?  You weren't fooling anybody.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And you were good at sports, but didn't you notice everyone ran out of the locker room  when you decided it was time to shower?  Oh, okay.  You weren't fooling anyone.  Not a soul.  Did he fool some people for a while in elementary school?  Like, when you just thought he was sensitive?  Right.  I didn't fully understand what that was all about as a little kid, but I knew something 
[00:33:30]  was different.  Uh, yeah.  Kind of talk like a girl.  Yeah, hung out with the girls a lot.  You were great in the mile, but you weren't fooling anyone.  Was he in drama class?  Did he do a lot of plays?  Was he in drama?  That's a really good question.  I don't remember anymore.  I always wanted to be in the plays, but I didn't have the courage to go in and audition 
[00:34:00]  and do that.  But then when the play was all, like, put together, and it was like the night they did  it, I always felt like I wanted to be one of the in crowd that was, like, hanging out  and getting the adulation.  Right.  And then hanging out, like, afterwards in the back hallway by the stage, congratulating  each other with their bad makeup on and everything.  Sure.  Or, yeah, I kind of wanted to, I was a nobody.  Valerie, we knew there was something going on.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:34:30]  With one of the, uh, really?  This one might be, maybe I should shut up.  Oh, so you're talking about a crime.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, there was a lot of staying after school and Valerie, uh, people were talking.  Mm.  I want to say last name so bad right now to prove my point, but.  Well, yeah, I can't quite do that.  Jimmy, you want to share?  A couple of people.  You got one?  Know anyone in school?  Or was it you?  No. 
[00:35:00]  You're the one that if anyone else had a radio show, they'd be talking about you.  Oh, no, it was this guy, Jim.  There was a lot of sexual deviants when I was a boy.  Was there?  Of course.  In school?  Not in school, but with school kids, yeah.  With little schoolmates?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talked about it, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, well.  Was it alone?  I'll know about that.  Yeah.  Let's go to Sarah in Jersey.  Sarah.  Hi, boys.  How are you?  Good, Sarah.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi.  In eighth grade, there was a girl named Christy Reischer.  Whoa. 
[00:35:30]  Did we go last names here?  Well, for that, it's okay.  Okay.  I don't care.  She deserves it.  All right.  It was time to switch classrooms, and she came out with her khakis that were nicely stained  red, and she had no idea.  Oh, wow.  Right in the middle of eighth grade class.  Yeah.  She's walking through the hallways, has no idea.  A teacher had to pull her aside and say, look, you've got a problem, and to cover it  up, she's using her purse to hide it. 
[00:36:00]  Not quite working, huh?  No.  Everyone's just laughing their ass off as we walk to class.  Nice.  There you go.  We're calling out our classmates from the past.  Pat Brooklyn.  Like Jackie O's dress.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's up, Pat?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Pat!  One time in second grade or third grade or something, this kid just crapped in the  classroom, and the smell was intense, and no one knew what it was.  And then all of a sudden, someone saw a piece of crap underneath his desk, which kind of 
[00:36:30]  boggles the mind, because how did the crap actually get from the piece of the town?  I don't know if that's going to...  Yeah, you got...  Yeah.  I don't know.  You might not have kept it clean.  I don't know.  We were giving them the benefit of the doubt, and then, nah, we don't know, because now  it's being used as that.  Just a kid went in his pants.  Sure.  So you say he went in his pants and smelled the whole room up.  Yeah.  See, there you go. 
[00:37:00]  I like to think our listeners can figure stuff out if we speak in code.  Yeah.  I think we got some bright listeners for the most part.  You don't have to over-explain to the point where the FCC has to get involved.  Yes, Jimmy?  I had a bad habit of, let's just say, not making it to the restroom, because I like to  go at home only.  I was one of those people I didn't like to do in the public facilities.  I don't think anybody really enjoys the public facility more than they do home.  Home is home.  You were sick of getting hit on?  No. 
[00:37:30]  No, but got to a point, oh my God, no, I just...  Tapping the foot underneath the stall.  Tap, tap, tap.  Wide stance.  I remember I had a little accident.  Yeah.  And I was in line to leave, and all the classes...  I had a big crush on Kelly Howell.  Oh, who didn't?  Oh, of course.  She was very cute.  Was she?  And I remember she was standing right behind me, and it was very obvious that I had a  little accident.  Oh, no.  I'll never forget the tap of her finger on my shoulder.  She tapped you?  Kelly never talked to me. 
[00:38:00]  And I'm like, yeah.  Good icebreaker.  Yeah.  And she tapped me, and she goes, did you go poops in your pants?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I attempted sarcasm, and I was like, yeah, right.  But I had...  But you were being accurate.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  I did.  That was awful.  I'll never forget that little tap.  She actually had to tap you and ask you.  Yeah, she didn't beat around the bush.  No.  No. 
[00:38:30]  Wow, that would be embarrassing to even have to ask you.  Think how embarrassed you must have been.  Horrified.  What'd you do?  Stood there and stared straight ahead.  The same way I did when Lynn in high school, when I used to be very greasy, and I wouldn't  shower much.  And she was sitting next to a girl I had a big crush on.  And then she leaned forward and goes, hey, why don't you wash your hair?  And then it was sitting together.  Her and this girl I had a big crush on.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  And I didn't answer her.  And I said, it is washed. 
[00:39:00]  That was my answer.  You had some really bad comebacks.  It is washed.  It is washed.  Yes, I was taking the Carlisi improv class.  And then she tapped me again, and I just kind of kicked back at her chair.  Whoa, like, shut up.  Yeah.  She laid off.  Wow.  I had to figure out the physical violence.  Amazing.  We got the phones lit.  877-212-01A.  We're calling out past classmates.  One of the many things we're doing today. 
[00:39:30]  Also, we started the break by talking about the running of the bulls.  Yeah.  They do this for eight days, Jimmy.  Eight days they torture these damn bulls.  Through the streets of Papalona.  And they, yeah, you ever see the bulls, like, when they slide on the pavement, just smash  into a building?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're not made to run on pavement.  No, but they do this for eight straight days.  Eight days these poor bulls have to deal with this crap.  You know what would be kind of interesting today is to see other things we do with animals 
[00:40:00]  to make ourselves feel better.  Because I remember one where they throw, like...  How about a chicken and a German?  What's the one where they throw, like, a...  I think it's a calf from, like, the fifth floor.  Whoa.  And it's some kind of religious ceremony or something.  I think it's in India.  I can't remember.  Of course it's in India.  Of course.  But we do some sick crap with animals. 
[00:40:30]  I want to get a few of those on the show today.  The ones where it's tradition, it's religious, those type of things.  It's not some ass doing something dumb.  I'm talking about something that they do year after year after year.  That's accepted.  That's accepted, yes.  I remember something with a calf being thrown to its death, and that's supposed to bring  good luck, or I don't know.  Not to the calf.  Yeah, no kidding.  Jesus.  We'll get the info after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Andy.  That's what you're listening to. 
[00:41:00]  I'm Andy.  Opie and Andy.  Tiffany's show.  You got that right.  Lots going on today.  Got more stories.  We're calling out our classmates from the past.  You know who they are.  They kind of got a little infamy there during their school years by doing various things.  Maybe going to the bathroom in the cafeteria. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Throwing up in the hallway.  It's all molded in grammar school, and you can become the star quarterback or the really,  really hot chick by the time high school rolls around, but it always goes back to what you  remember from grammar school.  Yeah, because kids are cool.  Let's say hi to Dano in Kentucky.  Dano.  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you. 
[00:42:00]  Jimmy's got a big one coming up in 10 days.  It's his birthday every day, but the big birthday is in 10 days, and it's a biggie.  Yes, he'll be 21.  Yes.  All right, guys.  I went to school at Scott High School in Kenton County, Kentucky.  Sure.  We had a young man there named Michael.  I'll leave his last name out of it.  He was captain of the video club, and he did a piece on the basketball team.  Okay.  Yes.  Well, as soon as it went to fuzz, there was Michael. 
[00:42:30]  I know what you're going to say.  I'm going to help you out with this one.  He was taking care of himself.  Yes, thank you.  So this kid was making a video for the, what did you say, the basketball team?  Yeah, it was like captain of the video club or whatever.  And what, they were, you got to explain a little bit.  So then they're going to show this video during one of their games?  No, they showed the video like before first period started.  It was like a little TV news thing, and then it was like a local, like a school event show, 
[00:43:00]  like a school news show.  Sure.  Okay, I got you.  Well, anyway, this is the best part.  The wrestling coach looks up at the screen in his class.  He looks up, because he also teaches health, and he goes, we'll be discussing that later  in the year, guys.  Like, oof, wow.  Kind of embarrassing.  No kidding.  He's never lived it down.  Unless you're like really sporting.  Then it's kind of like, hey, hey, he threw this in on purpose. 
[00:43:30]  That's right.  Hi, gals.  I was advertising.  We all do it.  Might as well show you what I got.  Let's do one more, and then we're going to move on to a couple things,  then get back to this.  Todd Richmond, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Todd.  Hey, I'm going to call out a girl in first grade.  Her name was Tammy.  This is actually kind of calling out a teacher, too, because Tammy was one of these girls.  This is pre-Ritalin days when all we were back then is just hyper brats,  and no one could stand this girl. 
[00:44:00]  She was always acting up.  Teachers used to always say the same thing our parents did to us was, you know,  we wanted attention.  Tammy always wanted attention.  Teacher had enough one day.  Tammy snaps, grabs this girl, brings her out to the hallway into these recessed glass showcases.  They used to put, like, nativity scenes and things like that in there.  Trophies, things like that, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Unlocks the showcase, puts Tammy inside, locks her in,  marches out every first grade classroom, and says to each kid, one at a time, 
[00:44:30]  go give Tammy all the attention she wants.  And we all had to stand there and just laugh our butts off.  And so, of course, Tammy, you really used to help on a hay bale beside a pumpkin,  and it was just phenomenal.  God bless that teacher for doing that, but you do that these days.  Oh, you're in jail.  Are you fired or so fired on this one?  So fired.  So fired.  And probably in jail.  Yeah, unfortunately.  And for good reason, because I'll be honest with you,  that girl was never the same after that.  It's like she suffered some kind of brain damage. 
[00:45:00]  It fixed her.  It fixed her.  No medication, just good old-fashioned butt-kicking.  There was a retard that used to live down the street.  A tard?  A tard.  A waterhead?  Used to live down the street.  Yeah.  And their house had a big bow window,  you know those windows that kind of protrude out a little bit?  Well, because the kid wants to get his big head near the window.  Yeah, yeah.  Big head's got to be...  And on the inside of a bow window, 
[00:45:30]  it's almost like you've got this little ledge to stand on  to be in the bow window.  Well, this retarded kid, it was a girl, by the way,  would stand there and she'd just take her clothes off.  Oh, nice.  And all the neighborhood kids would just stand in front of this window and watch.  It was like Amsterdam.  Amsterdam.  Dumb.  Yeah.  And, you know, we would just stand there and watch until her parents had come 
[00:46:00]  and just kind of pull her away from the window.  Yeah.  To all of us booing.  Was she pretty or was she a mess?  Oh, she was a mess.  She was, you know, well, down syndrome and stuff.  So she would take her clothes off and just kind of stand, not move, not do anything sexy,  just stand there naked.  And we would all just go, ooh.  Kids.  Jesus.  We're just such sick little bastards.  Of course.  Hey, the other thing, because the running of the bulls, 
[00:46:30]  we learned it's for eight days they're doing this to the bulls.  And by the way, I know what goring is or to be gored.  I just like to think that the horn's going someplace.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody's calling me out on it.  I know what it means.  He goes, that's not what it means.  He actually got gored in the abdomen.  All right.  But I'd like to think that the bull's really winning and getting one up the you-know-what.  They would still be getting gored in the abdomen if it goes far enough.  Yeah, exactly.  So we're looking for other, this is another thing we're doing today where we mess with 
[00:47:00]  animals for our pleasure because it's a ceremony of religious, some kind of religious ceremony  or some kind of tradition.  And Jason from Columbus reminds us of one.  And what about in the 20s when a girl riding a horse would jump off a platform into a tub  of water?  That was for our enjoyment every summer.  The steel pier down at Atlantic City.  Yeah.  And now, as we all gather around, Mary on her horse is going to jump off of this 100-foot 
[00:47:30]  platform into a bucket of water.  Look how excited the horse seems to be doing this.  You know, if the horse could talk, what do you think he would say?  Ah!  I don't want to do this.  Please don't make me do this.  It's against every instinct I have.  Right.  I want to be back in the field.  Yes, I'll pull a plow.  That is something a horse does not want to do. 
[00:48:00]  And if you've ever seen, like, old film clips of it, the horse is so apprehensive to jump  off.  Its little hooves are going...  It does not want to go.  And there's Mary kicking away.  They basically got to push the horse over the side.  Basically, what they do, I think, you know, the diving board, they just make it smaller  and smaller and smaller.  They just start pulling it in.  Yeah.  Pull it in and let the horse just fall.  Until the horse doesn't have a choice. 
[00:48:30]  What would happen?  I'm not sure what happened.  It was the most disgusting thing ever.  It was the diving horse.  And they would both jump into this giant wooden bucket of water.  Like a pool.  Did the horse die?  No, not supposed to.  It wasn't supposed to, I'm sure.  But it was never the same.  They had their shares.  Yeah.  The horse just got out of there going, oh my God.  What the hell was that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, for our enjoyment, that's what we did. 
[00:49:00]  We did a lot of fun things with that.  Here's the diving horse.  Wait, the best part of this footage, it's old school footage, we'll throw it up on onaradio.com.  Start it over again.  The horse thinks it's getting a treat.  It's running up these stairs like, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, I'm  getting a treat.  Where am I going?  Here, watch.  I'm going somewhere special.  Yeah, watch this, Jimmy.  I get a good view.  All of a sudden, the horse is really motivated to run up these stairs, because I'm sure we  tricked it into something.  They're showing a bunch of old clips of stupid things people do. 
[00:49:30]  There, look.  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  It's going to be fun.  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  They run the horse.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Right into the pool.  Into a pool.  And now he's just like, what the hell just happened?  Give me some oats.  We just, we just, we stink.  Our relationship with animals, we stink.  Oh, we're much better than we used to be as far as entertainment goes.  That's for sure.  And although we'll still dress a monkey up in a cowboy hat and have him ride a dog.  Sure.  Because that's just hysterical. 
[00:50:00]  It really is funny.  I will say that PETA gets carried away, because my thing that I think is entertaining is you  take baby elephants.  Yeah.  And it's called a tap dance.  And what you do is you take the baby elephants and you put them in a little pit with thumbtacks  and nails, and they have to walk on it, and they go, ow, ow, ow.  But you play music, it looks like they're dancing.  And you hear little clickety-clack sounds.  And I've been criticized for that amusing thing.  You shouldn't be.  Yeah.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  It's cute.  The little trunks go up.  As they try to pull the tacks out of their feed with their trunk.  Yeah, then they get in their trunk.  They're like, what's going on here? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, this was our own Sam?  This happened, too?  What?  Oh, I wasn't even going to go to this phone call.  Kevin, Virginia Beach, what's up?  What's happening, boys?  How are you?  I'm doing well.  Good.  Just thought I'd throw a little classmate under the bus.  Okay.  But your young waist employee, Sam.  You went to school with Sam?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  Oh.  And I was actually a part of this as well.  But singing the theme to different strokes in the hallway of high school. 
[00:51:00]  Sam used to?  Oh, yeah.  No, he wouldn't.  Why?  Oh, Sam.  I only want to hear you singing the different strokes theme if you and Dudley are in a tub.  What was his name?  Mr. Carlson.  Yeah.  Now he's got hair like Willis, too.  And hopefully he winds up like Kimberly.  Sam, are you used to sing the different strokes theme in high school? 
[00:51:30]  Well, you have to understand, this is when different strokes was just starting on Nick at Night.  So it was an exciting time in my life and in Kevin's life.  You're not selling this one.  And so, I mean, yes, there would be mornings where we'd sing a different strokes song.  Well, you know, why don't you give us a little bit of the different strokes theme?  You want to sing over the music or you want to go acapella?  I think you should go acapella like he would have been in school. 
[00:52:00]  Acapella.  Let's go.  Oh, the camera's in here.  You know how you film people doing weird stuff?  Look at Steve running in and filming you.  Oh, what's the matter, Steve?  Oh, Steve just ran out.  What happened?  You know something?  Sam's always prepared with the camera.  Always.  And Steve comes in with the camera thinking he's going to get Sam.  Nope.  And he just went, ah, and ran out.  What happened, Steve?  He growled like a big bear.  Do you have tape in it?  Yeah, it usually is tape in it.  Now you're opening up a... 
[00:52:30]  All right.  You got a new cassette, a little HD cassette there.  I guess I'll just wait here and warm up the pipes or something.  Yeah, why don't you do a little meme?  Yes.  Meme, meme, meme.  Steve, any funny comments about how you walked in without any tape in the camera?  None whatsoever.  I don't have tape.  We know that.  Dude, I was laughing all day yesterday after work.  I was just doing Steve improv all day. 
[00:53:00]  I was doing everything literally.  I'm putting something in the microwave.  That's all I was doing.  All right.  Let's get the different strokes, Meme.  What are we talking about?  Yeah.  We got film in the camera.  Let's go.  All right.  Here we go.  Well, the world don't move to the beat of just one drum.  What might be right for you may not be right for some. 
[00:53:30]  A man is born.  He's a man of means.  Then along come to.  They got nothing but their genes.  But they got different strokes.  It takes different strokes.  It takes different strokes.  Everybody's got a special kind of story.  Everybody finds a way to shine.  Kirk Douglas' theme song.  It don't matter that you got not a lot.  So what?  They'll have theirs and you'll have yours and I'll have mine.  Sam, so you went down to the New York Times building this morning, didn't you? 
[00:54:00]  I can't even look at Sam.  You did that in school?  Well, there was more people.  I mean, Kevin would join in and a couple other people.  That's why you need a little harmony, right?  You friends join in?  Well, we were just being silly.  Were you?  Silly.  Yeah.  Medcap times.  Were you really?  Yeah.  Just kind of before class.  Good times.  Good times.  Where did you go to?  Well, Kevin used to sing it with you?  Yeah.  Hey, Kevin.  Yeah.  Son of a bitch.  You're going to know when to. 
[00:54:30]  Do you know when to jump in here?  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Why don't you start?  I'm going to go again.  Yeah.  Kevin, when you know when to jump in, you just jump in with your old  classmate, Sam.  You ready?  You ready, Kevin?  I love it.  Okay.  Well, the world don't move to the beat of just one drum.  Might be right for you.  May not be right for some.  A man is born.  He's a man of me.  Then along come true. 
[00:55:00]  They got nothing but the genes.  But they got different strokes.  It takes different.  His phone isn't working very well, is it?  It just messed up the whole bit.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  You suck.  Yeah.  That was wonderful.  That was being cool.  No, Kevin also used to laugh at the retarded kids to their faces, so he was not a nice person.  All right.  We also have Sam in here because you went down to what?  What did you do?  Opie and Anthony get the scoop on the story of the century. 
[00:55:30]  You're calling it the story of the century, Sam.  Wow.  I just have a question about Sam.  Do the different strokes remind you of your own thing?  The white family adopting the black kid?  No, I'm not.  All right.  I'm not adopted.  Well, you are black, though.  Actually, both my parents are Caucasian.  Sam's a light-skinned black guy, and I think that his parents adopted him, and he doesn't  know that.  You're Sam's brother.  There's black blood in this family.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Somewhere.  There's some black blood.  A few drops there, Sam.  You think there's been some shenanigans, Sam?  Yeah.  It has yet to be uncovered. 
[00:56:00]  You admitted that you're a descendant of the great Thomas Jefferson.  Thomas Jefferson, who, of course, has a whole part of his family.  They get together at the family reunion every year.  Only one part of the family.  Well, no.  Actually, the black part of the family has started to show up at these reunions now that  they found out that he did, in fact, have sexual relations with some of his slaves who  had children, and they consider themselves descendants, which they are, of Thomas Jefferson. 
[00:56:30]  Imagine the first year they showed up at the party.  How annoyed everybody got.  Well, I guess they're here.  That's part of our culture we kind of wanted to forget about.  The court said we got to let him into the party.  First year was probably awkward.  So, Sam, knowing that about Thomas Jefferson, and then looking at you, and you swear you're  a descendant, see, it's obvious.  There's something going on.  Well, I mean, there's...  You guys might have got back on track, but someone went off the road for a little while. 
[00:57:00]  Well, and then we found out that Sam dated black girls exclusively for up until his present  girlfriend, I believe.  Before he met the lovely Jess, who everybody wants to...  What?  Jesus.  Just talk to.  Just talk to?  Yes.  She's a good conversationalist.  Yes, she is there, Sam.  I think Ronnie has a major crush on her, and I know Club Soda Kenny does, and I know the  list goes on and on.  Yes, there, Jimmy. 
[00:57:30]  You all right?  Yeah.  What happened?  No, I'm just looking at the dump list.  Oh, I'm sure.  What got dumped?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's...  Poop.  They dumped the word poop.  How?  You know something?  Can somebody ask...  Yeah, yeah.  We got to fight for something here.  Can somebody ask if the FCC...  Has ever...  Has ever find a show for someone telling a story about when they were a little boy, and they 
[00:58:00]  had an accident, and they used the word poop.  Yeah, please.  And I know that you're doing your job as a dump guy, but come on, man, you got to use  some common sense.  No one.  That's never going to be finable, and it never was finable.  If you said that to the Pope, he'd chuckle.  Right.  You know, a lot of people are trying to figure out how to save radio.  If you want to save radio, you got to get young, hip lawyers.  Not these old curmudgeons that this company has been with for decades. 
[00:58:30]  Who can we ask about that?  It's time for these lawyers that they presently have to retire and let some young bucks that  have a little gumption come in and keep everything edgy and safe at the same time.  They just dumped the word gumption.  Oh.  Oh.  I mean, when it gets down to the fact that we have to dump out the word poop, these lawyers  are out of touch.  Please.  They need to move on.  Simple as that.  Please, somebody do some research.  Simple as that.  And find out if there's ever been a fine levied for the use of the word poop. 
[00:59:00]  In that context.  Right, right.  I mean, I would love for this show to be fine for using the word poop.  That would be hilarious.  Not a variation of it.  Not in a context that is filthy or against FCC regulations.  I understand.  But I even defy you to find one of those.  Well, Hildebrand is coming up next week to have a little session with us.  Oh, is he?  Don't even bother.  We did that session.  And then he sits there and explains why we can't do anything. 
[00:59:30]  I'm like, this wasn't the reason we're meeting, you ass.  I haven't talked to that guy since that meeting, if you need to know the truth.  That guy's a waste of time.  Don't meet with him.  Go have lunch with the guys.  I'm sure I won't be invited to it, but can you just ask him?  Don't meet with him.  I'm telling you, it's going to be a waste of time.  Now you got under my skin.  And we were supposed to have this big to-do meeting, like, okay, look, there's problems  here, so we need to meet and figure out how we can work together and how you guys can 
[01:00:00]  help us do an edgier show.  And the whole meeting was two hours of him explaining why we can't do this, this, this,  and this.  I'm like, we accomplished nothing.  Don't meet with him.  I'm telling you right now.  I'll try and get out of it, but it was sent from above.  Of course.  Well, you have to.  You have to.  Why are the...  What's the reasoning?  About the...  The guy's out of touch and doesn't give a crap if this show survives or not.  He don't care.  He doesn't care.  We need young lawyers that understand there's a very, very talented radio show that could 
[01:00:30]  get massive ratings, but you got to help us out and allow us to be edgy, knowing that  the word poop is not going to get us fined.  So you need a kid out of a Grisham novel.  Yeah.  Yes!  That's what we want.  Yes!  A young go-getter that's got to prevail.  Well, that...  I've been dealing with these lawyers since we moved to New York 10 years ago, and they  were in place way before we got here.  They're a waste.  They're not helping no one except making sure their bank accounts are nice and fat. 
[01:01:00]  Because then when we don't get the job done, then there'll be another show, and they'll  make their jobs miserable.  The word poop.  Don't meet with them.  I'm telling you.  It's going to be a waste of time.  Well, it's about the bag words, too.  Dude, has anyone watched...  Oh, my God.  You got me going.  Well, that's it.  I mean, that's what I'm going in there for.  Has anyone watched I Survived a Japanese game show yet, and we're not allowed to do  Asian humor on this radio show?  Are you kidding me? 
[01:01:30]  Hmm.  Take a peek at I Survived a Japanese game show.  Yeah.  They make fun of what we can't make fun of.  Of course.  Oh, my...  Don't meet with them.  I'm telling you.  I will never meet with them again.  Never.  I'll try to get out of it.  I got one of those invitations.  Oh, when he gets saved from brass.  Yeah, you got to go.  What was the reasoning?  Well, we had an incident where some of the bag words got out.  Good.  They should have.  Yeah, I know that. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, the DB?  Yeah.  A couple DBs.  So now you have to meet with them?  And the SBs.  The FCC is not going to fine you for saying DB.  Sorry.  It's not an FCC issue.  It's a CBS issue.  They're going to drive you nuts.  They don't give a crap about you and your career.  They don't give a crap about the race.  No, he actually should meet because it will give him an insight into what...  Yeah.  How ridiculous it is!  Well, he has to.  He has no choice.  Yeah, of course.  He can't just say I'm not meeting with them.  Yeah.  He has to.  He can.  We can. 
[01:02:30]  Well, he can.  You're part of the show now.  Look, I don't even want to be on mic.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, you have to meet with them.  Dude, it was infuriating because Ant and I were like, holy crap, this is a nightmare.  So we had this big meeting.  They flew up.  We had the big guy who we definitely respect, Dan Mason, a few others in the room, Tom Chiasano,  who we respect.  He's gone from the company now.  And we sat down and we got nothing accomplished.  I sat there like, why are we even meeting?  I don't need to know why we can't do things. 
[01:03:00]  I need you guys to help us be able to get other things on our radio show.  This is one of the very few CBS things I was allowed to be at.  And I was at this meeting and I asked him point blank because we couldn't have topless girls in here.  We weren't allowed to have topless girls.  Which has nothing to do with the FCC, by the way.  Nothing.  And he said, well, it might get into this area.  And I'm like, well, has there ever been a fine levied for somebody just being topless in a studio?  I mean, it's mind boggling to me.  On a radio show. 
[01:03:30]  And he goes, well, no.  What are you doing?  I mean, this is not six degrees of Kevin Bacon.  I mean, how far do you want to go?  How far removed are we going to get?  Oh, by the way, they said they'll look into it and try to figure it out.  Guess what?  We never heard from them again.  Don't meet with them.  I'll try not to.  If you meet with them, you're fired.  Jesus Christ.  Don't meet with them.  I'm telling you.  It's a waste of time.  Well, I went in to try and get.  No, call them back and go, look, I don't want to meet with you guys.  It's a waste of time.  We'll make sure your dumb DB word is dumped every time now.  Which has nothing to do with you. 
[01:04:00]  It's the guy down the hall.  And he shouldn't be dumping that.  But I was going in to try and get things changed.  Especially after the Mike Myers thing.  Remember, he said the poop word and it got dumped.  And it was a simple thing.  Wait, what did he get dumped for?  Poop.  Oh, Mike Myers got dumped for poop?  Yeah.  We have to fight for poop.  And I think it's worth fighting for.  I think poop is worth fighting for.  We have to make a stand on poop.  These guys are ways of time.  And I brought up the same thing Travis just handed to me in the list of children's books 
[01:04:30]  with the word poop in the title that have been covered on morning shows and shows like  Oprah and Regis and all this stuff.  I'm about to read a list of children's books with the word poop in the title.  Right.  Let's see if it makes the air.  These are books that five-year-olds are reading.  They're reading.  And, of course, all these rules are put into place to protect the children.  Give me a thumbs up or a thumbs down there, E-Rock.  A list of children's books with the word poop in the title.  Everyone poops. 
[01:05:00]  That one is a very well-known one, by the way, too.  Is it?  Yeah.  A lot of parents get that one for their kids.  They also read a book called Where's the Poop?  Who's mud-flapping Matty?  Any more of these filthy offensive titles?  Yes.  I got distracted.  Worst morning show ever.  A show in Myrtle Beach called Mud-Flapping Matty.  It hurts when I poop. 
[01:05:30]  Emotionally?  A story for children who are scared to use the potty.  Oh.  And then, finally, the truth about poop.  Thumbs up or down on the list of children's books that use the word poop there, E-Rock?  E-Rock's still listening on delay.  Yeah, we're there on delay.  So, E-Rock's listening in delay.  And then you gotta...  I don't see how you can...  What?  The first one was dumped.  The first one was dumped.  The first one dumped? 
[01:06:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Come on, man.  And you're gonna meet with these idiots?  You're a dummy.  Thank you.  Stunt Parade is a dummy.  Yeah, but you gotta use your common sense to hit on the button.  You gotta tell these guys no.  But I'm saying...  He can't...  He has to meet with them.  He can't not...  Even though he doesn't want to, he has to.  He can't say no.  It's impossible.  They'll say, you're meeting and you're fired.  He has to.  And I have to feel like I can stand up for the show and at least make a swing at it.  If you're gonna meet with them, go, look, I know this is...  I just wanna acknowledge that this is a complete waste of time, but I'm forced to meet with you. 
[01:06:30]  That should be your opening statement.  I would like the meeting standing up, because that way it'll last five minutes.  Dude, these guys are a waste of time.  They don't give a crap about our success.  They don't care if we succeed or fail whatsoever.  They don't care.  They just don't care.  What else, E-Rock?  Just the first one.  They dumped the first children's book?  Just the first one.  That was the most popular one, too, right?  Bro, you dumped the title of a children's book.  Yeah.  No, I don't blame him.  I really don't.  He's got his... 
[01:07:00]  He's got the people that are telling him what to do.  I understand that.  I mean, you know...  I don't think anybody's ever said to him...  You've got to go way above the dump guy on this one.  I don't blame him.  It sounded like it, but Jiven's saying it's not.  The first one wasn't dumped.  Oh, okay.  Then what was dumped?  Just the last one.  The last one was dumped?  Just the last one.  It hurts when I...  Yeah, the last one.  Oh, my...  Oh, my God.  It's mind-boggling.  This one.  Yeah.  That is just beyond me. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  You know what?  Just get your iPods and get it over with.  Just destroy radio for us, please.  We're doomed as like a nation.  When they're doing that, I don't get it.  Why are these guys responsible for radio?  I don't get it.  Those are children's books.  I don't get why these lawyers are responsible for our success.  They're not keeping us safe.  They're available.  They're making it harder for us to do this job.  Because they've sunk their claws into every other aspect of entertainment, and that's  what lawyers do. 
[01:08:00]  They sink their claws into things.  They create nothing.  They help nothing.  So stunt day brain.  Yeah.  Stunt of the brain.  So you were forced to meet with them?  Because the D-B word got...  Well, I initially...  A real few times?  I initially asked after the Mike Myers thing, because I wanted to fight for it.  I thought, geez, we've got to be able to stand up and take a swing for ourselves.  And that was said, yeah, eventually.  And then the D-Bag and the S-Bag thing happened, and they said, let's get everybody back in 
[01:08:30]  line and make sure, since you're the new guy, that everybody understands where the lines  are.  Yeah.  Nice and safe, gang.  Yeah, the lines are way, way back.  From where they should be if you were a young, hip lawyer and understood, you know, how hard  it is to do this type of radio to begin with.  Yep.  You don't give a crap.  Nope.  I will never meet with them again.  Never.  Maybe physically, I might have to, but I won't be there emotionally. 
[01:09:00]  Emotionally.  Not at all.  Nope.  Don't even say hi to him anymore.  We did that corporate function, and he's across the room, like, pfft.  Don't even look at me.  I don't acknowledge you exist.  You made our jobs a nightmare.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Gutshot Drew is making me laugh today from Howell.  He writes, Stunt Brain is like the new soldier in Vietnam, all bright-eyed, thinking he can  make a difference.  Vets O&A understand the quagmire. 
[01:09:30]  Excuse me.  But let him go to his cute little meeting, knowing he's going to get his blanks blown  off.  Stay with me, Stunt Brain.  Stay with me.  See this piece of crap?  Bag him and tag him.  Go have fun at your little meeting as they talk down to you the entire time and belittle  you.  They're not even that bright.  They stink.  Like, literally, when you're debating over a point, it's not like you're debating F.  Lee Bailey.  Right.  It's irritating. 
[01:10:00]  They don't have answers, usually.  I, well, I, uh...  And I know you don't like me.  I, uh...  And I don't care.  We looked into that.  What, what, what, Jimmy?  What?  Not you.  No, I didn't hear, though.  I said, and I know you don't like me, and I don't care.  I don't give a crap who likes us.  Well, I care if the listeners like us.  I really do.  I like being liked.  Listeners, do you like us?  It's fun.  I mean, all of us.  I know you have your favorites, but do you like the show in general?  After me, who's your favorite?  Hey!  Hey! 
[01:10:30]  I want to give a shout-out to the Deadheads, because it was 13 years ago today that the  Grateful Dead played their last show.  13 years?  Yeah.  And I think Jerry's been dead for about 12 now.  15.  Well, parts of his body have been dead for a while.  He's missing what?  Whole dead feet finger.  He was missing a finger.  And then you got some birth days.  We don't usually do birth days, but yeah.  You doing a birthday shout-out?  Well, you got three. 
[01:11:00]  You got Courtney Love.  She's 44 today.  You got Tom Hanks.  How old do you think Tom Hanks is?  I'm kind of surprised at this, actually.  52.  Wow.  Really?  I thought he would be older with all the hit movies he's had over the years.  Oh, I thought you were thinking he'd be younger.  Okay.  Mm-mm.  And then, uh, guess how old OJ is?  Hmm.  Today.  Ha-ha!  OJ is 61, which means he killed, uh, well, allegedly. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, no, he killed him.  The civil society, he killed his wife.  All right, good.  So we could officially start saying that.  He always could.  He killed her.  We know it.  Um, he's 61 today.  Which means he was, what, 47 when he, uh, when he did what he did.  I thought he was older when he did what he did.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, uh, we had a guy climb in the New York Times, uh, building here in New York City.  This is not a repeat.  Uh, this is the third guy.  We had two guys do it about a month ago or so, and they went all the way to the top.  Third guy today decided to go up about, uh, 11 stories, I believe. 
[01:12:00]  He hung some dumb banner that no one could read, and they arrested him.  What's up, Jimmy?  I'm thinking of the size of his banner.  Yeah.  Like, what a dope.  Yeah.  Just a small little poster.  Yeah.  That no one could read.  So Sam ran down there.  Oh, thank God.  And got, uh, some man on the street stuff.  And we love man on the street stuff, right?  Oh, yeah.  And this stuff, I mean, these people watching for hours on end, some guy who climbed up 
[01:12:30]  and put up a bed sheet with some stickers that nobody could read on it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was like, I mean, you could see the banner, but then there were a bunch of red stickers  or letters or, I mean.  It was basically eight by tens.  Yeah.  All over the place that you couldn't read.  No.  Some guy with a southern accent explains what's going on to young Sam.  All right.  So you've been here since like five o'clock.  What are we looking at?  Somebody's climbing up this building?  Yeah.  When I got here, he was on, uh, right at the New York Times on the T hanging out. 
[01:13:00]  And then they went through the glass, it looks like, and pulled him in a few minutes ago.  And he hung a flag, which they're pulling up now.  I just don't know what the flag says.  Where are you from?  Are you from here?  I'm from down in Virginia, but I live here now.  Oh, okay.  How long have you been living here for?  I've been living here for a little over a year and absolutely love New York.  So, I mean, the excitement on the street was at a fever pit.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  This is, uh, yeah.  The whole city stopped for this one, huh, Sam?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:13:30]  They had to close off like a whole block.  Southern guy says who he's voting for and why, then comments on the New York Times climber jumping.  He thinks he's going to jump?  Well, that was the question posed.  You know, is he, isn't he?  It's crazy stuff.  All right.  Do you have any plans on who you're going to vote for in the upcoming election?  Oh, yes.  Obama.  How come?  I feel like it is time for a change.  I don't think we can take another four years of the Republican Party.  What kind of changes would you like to see?  Oh, I'd like to see changes in just the way to help bring our boys back home from overseas. 
[01:14:00]  And I'd like to see some changes just in just the way the people are treated here in the United States.  Are you secretly kind of hoping that this guy jumps off the building?  No, I'm not.  I do like seeing that big air mattress over there.  That's kind of the first time I've ever seen one of them besides on TV.  Do you think that would really help him if he jumped?  No, Lord, no.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Y'all have a good one.  I'm sort of invested in this.  I kind of like this.  Why is it?  I kind of like Sam on the street.  Why wouldn't the air mattress help? 
[01:14:30]  It wasn't a big mattress.  I mean...  Oh, really?  The New York Times' building is a block long.  Yeah.  And the mattress is like the size of a car.  Oh, okay.  So if you just jump a little to the right, a little to the left, you're going to miss the mattress.  Yeah, professional stuntmen have to do this.  Yeah.  You know?  And just some guy falling is going to hit the mattress.  And they have to deflate it.  Like, I think...  Remember that Steve McQueen movie?  It was done in Chicago where the guy jumps out of that giant parking garage.  Oh, yeah.  And he, like, lands or something like that on his back. 
[01:15:00]  What was it called?  Nobody remember?  I don't know.  It's one of the greatest stunts ever done for a movie, though.  Yeah.  That guy's dead now.  Really?  That stunt guy.  What was his name?  Oh, damn.  Jumped right through the window, right, Jimmy?  The breakaway glass?  I think so.  Or is that the one with the car?  There was a...  That was the car one.  The one I was talking about might be a Burt Reynolds movie.  Okay.  Yeah, it was a Burt Reynolds.  Sharky's machine.  Sharky's machine, yeah.  Yeah.  But when you fall, like, 13 stories or 10 stories, they have to deflate it, I think,  when you hit it so you don't bounce off and ricocheting, you know. 
[01:15:30]  That would be hilarious.  Yeah.  You survive it all, but then bounce another 10 stories up and back down to your death.  Actually, those things have, like, blowout things on the bottom of them, so when you  hit, it blows the air out of it.  It pink socks.  Or else you would.  Yeah.  It definitely pink socks.  Two days in a row.  Let's see how...  What kind of street do you get going with the pink sock joke?  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  He writes, CNN.com.  This will infuriate Jimmy even more.  CNN.com is showing a picture of a dead body on a curb with blood running down the street, 
[01:16:00]  and you guys can't say poop.  Yeah.  What's more offensive?  We can say poop, I guess, but we just can't say it in certain ways.  Yes.  Like every other human being.  Yeah.  Or like a five-year-old would say.  Yeah.  I'm in a bad mood.  I'm just, you know, I'm dealing with...  I'm not in a bad mood, you know, but this infuriates you, and it should infuriate you.  That's all I'm saying, Jimmy.  All right.  Back to Sam's on-the-street interviews.  Oh, yeah.  Some guy who can't speak lets us know what's happening.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm just trying to figure out what's the haps down there. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, okay.  Anyway, you're calling it the haps?  What's the haps down there?  It's a little reporter lingo.  You know, I love a good catchphrase, Sam.  What's the haps?  I like it.  What's the haps with Sam Roberts?  That's good.  I like that.  What's the haps?  Maybe you change your primetime gossip segment into...  I feel like...  Here's the haps.  This is the what's the haps segment.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So we're here at the New York Times building.  Sir, how long have you been here?  About 45 minutes.  What's been going on?  I know. 
[01:17:00]  So the guy who was over there, like on the...  So this is what Billy Crystal is doing these days?  No?  Boo!  What was his SNL character that this guy almost sounds like?  Yeah.  You look marvelous.  Yeah.  Almost.  All right.  All right.  So we're here at the New York Times building.  Sir, how long have you been here?  About 45 minutes.  What's been going on?  I know.  I saw the guy who was over there, like on the other side of the building, and he started 
[01:17:30]  moving.  And then he was coming, like, down.  I said, well, maybe he's going to, you know, maybe he's going to make a decision, maybe jump  or...  So this guy's just been climbing up the building since you've been here?  No.  I didn't see him climb the building, but I saw him inside the building.  The what?  All right.  Look.  The Bwilden?  I know it's America, but not everyone should be allowed to vote.  The Bwilden.  The what?  The Bwilden.  The what?  That's wonderful. 
[01:18:00]  And you got more audio of this guy?  Yeah.  I mean, I figure he's been there for like an hour, so he could tell me.  All right.  You know.  If you had to guess, what do you think, what would be his reason for going up there?  Maybe, you know, the war, the economy, you know?  Do you have any plans for who you're going to vote for in this election?  I don't know.  Maybe Barack Obama, you know?  How come?  You know, he's a young guy, you know, for young people, and I represent young people.  All right.  Cool.  Well, thank you very much. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Sorry.  There you go, Ant.  Every time we ask people why they're voting for Obama, or McCain for that matter, they  don't really have a good reason why.  Nah, change.  Well, this guy.  Ah, what's a change?  Young people for young people.  Yeah.  Young people for young people.  Uh, we're almost done with, uh, what's the haps?  Yeah, what's the haps?  This last guy, he let me know that he's been there for five hours.  And so all these other people that go around doing interviews with me, and interviews with  the TV stations that were down there, they don't even know what's going on. 
[01:19:00]  Because they got there 45 minutes an hour ago.  This guy's been there since the beginning.  So he gave me the scoop.  I love these guys.  All right, so we're here in front of the New York Times, Bill, and it looks like things  are cleaning up.  But how long have you been here, sir?  I've been here about a little bit over five hours.  That's the way I had by this guy.  Five hours?  Why?  Why?  Why?  I don't think I've ever been anywhere for five hours.  Not even a good baseball game. 
[01:19:30]  I'll bail after three and a half.  Five hours?  What is he doing?  Five hours he's standing there watching this guy.  And after, like, it's not like the guy was even on the outside of the building.  Like, it was kind of tiley.  Yeah.  So he was on the inside, so you couldn't even see the guy.  You could kind of see a shadow of him.  Oh, because that's what they put up, so you can't climb it?  No.  Well, yeah, like, he climbed it.  He wasn't even on the outside of the building?  Well, he had a ladder, and then he went behind the tiling and climbed up that way.  Oh, my God.  I thought that guy, oh, wow.  Oh, never mind.  It's a visual. 
[01:20:00]  That would have been amazing.  It looked like the guy was taking care of himself right on NBC.  But he was massaging his foot.  All right, I could give you the visual.  He had his foot way up like this, but you could only see the top of his foot, and he  was going like this on live TV.  Sounds sexy.  I'm like, and we can't say poop.  All right, go ahead.  Yeah, so, I mean, like, he's on the inside of the tiling, and so from the outside, you  could kind of see shadows.  So the whole time, people were like, oh, they got him.  Oh, they didn't.  That was the wind.  Right.  And, like, so they really don't know what they were seeing. 
[01:20:30]  No, and people had been there for hours.  All right, let's get back to the guy that was there for five hours.  Yeah.  And so what happened?  This guy just started climbing up the building?  Yeah, well, just from that section over there, he just started climbing the building.  He was actually on that side, and then he was just crossing over.  Do you have any idea why he's doing this?  Well, they were saying something about, he had put something up there saying something  about bin Laden.  Yeah.  That's what I heard from a reporter from Channel 11.  If you were there for five hours, I think you would have more info than what this guy 
[01:21:00]  is giving young Sam Roberts.  Now, by the way, that reporter from Channel 11 was Smug Guy.  He just heard Smug Guy talking.  He heard Smug Guy.  Oh, so that's what's going on.  Yeah.  He's just quoting Smug Guy.  Right.  Which anyone could have done if they were there for five minutes, not five hours.  And he was also putting these, like, stickers up there, like, put about five  stickers.  Oh, I got to read them.  Stickers.  Guy put color forms up on the Times building.  One of my favorite things is Sam's sarcasm. 
[01:21:30]  He writes for this track, the guy continues to give us the incredible inside scoop.  Sam.  Well, he's been there all night.  What the haps?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  He was also putting these, like, stickers up there, like, put about five stickers.  So he put them up after he got up there?  Yeah.  Wouldn't it have made more sense to make the banner and then go up there?  Yeah, no, I don't know.  Were you kind of hoping he was going to fall or jump? 
[01:22:00]  No.  Are you kind of hoping?  No, I wasn't.  Definitely not.  You know, I just thought the man, I just thought he was crazy or something at first.  You think he's right for protesting like that, or you think he's nuts?  Definitely not.  That's what you get.  Wow, incredible.  Five hours, you get that.  This guy was waiting there for five hours and didn't want him to jump.  Yeah, so what are you waiting for?  Oh, my God.  You know what?  All right.  A happy ending.  I will wait around for five hours if I think the guy's going to jump. 
[01:22:30]  Of course.  If you know the guy's going to jump.  If I can encourage him to do so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was only there for, like, 20 minutes and I wanted him to jump.  I'm not there, and I know he didn't jump, but I wish he had.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, there you go.  What's the haps?  I think we're going down the line that people are waiting on for Back to the Future shoes.  Yes.  Oh, this is incredible.  Nike?  Yeah, Danny and Travis.  You've got a lot of lines forming in New York City.  Just to backtrack, you've got the new iPhone.  They're already waiting on line at the Apple Store. 
[01:23:00]  July 11th.  And then we found out about the Back to the Future sneaks.  Back to the Future, Marty McFly, Back to the Future 2 shoes.  Yeah.  Danny and Travis are helping me with Back to the Future trivia.  Uh-oh.  We're going to see how much these guys know.  Do you really think they're on line for the shoes because they kind of look like Marty  McFly's Back to the Future 2 shoes?  Kind of.  They look exactly like them.  Do they?  I've yet to see a picture.  Well, they have laces.  So not exactly.  So they're not exactly.  Everyone knows Marty McFly's shoes did not have laces. 
[01:23:30]  But we haven't achieved that technology in sneaker yet.  I see Danny, another expert, has walked into it to join us here.  Oh, the Back to the Future crap.  What?  Why?  Oh, God.  Actually, there's been a, you know how people make these vlogs and you can sign up for like  an online petition or whatever?  Yeah.  There's been a petition floating around for at least probably two or three years already  to get the Marty McFly 2015 Nikes produced by Nike.  And finally, finally, this dream has come to fruition. 
[01:24:00]  Can I tell you?  What about the self-drawing jacket?  They're still working on that one.  Dammit.  I'm looking at the sneaker, by the way.  It looks like a Jordan Nike sneaker from 1985.  This was the...  No, 2015.  I know, but it looks like...  It's 2015 Marty McFly.  But it looks like something that Jordan wore like when he was winning championships for the  Chicago Bulls back in the day.  This sneaker is the pinnacle.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's the pinnacle of sneaker technology from the late 80s.  Yeah.  And it sticks to a hoverboard like no other sneaker can. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Plus, if you go to...  If you're looking at the movies and a big hologram shark from Jaws 15 comes out of you, as long  as you got your 2015 Marty McFly's on, you're going to be able to avoid it.  Is that another Back to the Future reference?  Forced it!  I don't give a crap about it.  Forced it!  You gotta watch the movie.  Oh, yeah.  18 more times like we have.  I know.  We're obsessed.  It's actually on the big holographic billboard that Jaws 19 was going to be directed by Max  Spielberg, which is Steven Spielberg's son. 
[01:25:00]  What?  Is it?  Is today's...  Is that another reference from this movie?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That one's from my head.  I've also been privy to some conversation with the boys here about the DeLorean actually  making some kind of a little comeback.  Yeah.  People are buying DeLoreans now.  Are they?  There's a company that is putting together the DeLorean parts that have been in storage,  the original parts, and selling a DeLorean. 
[01:25:30]  You can pick up a DeLorean for about 40 large now.  For brand new.  Brand spanking new DeLorean.  And a dream come true would be to have one customized with the flux capacitor inside.  And Mr. Fission.  Mr. Fission.  No, I would want the original plutonium version of that.  Because if you have the Mr. Fusion thing in there, first of all, you can't complete it  because it can't fly.  Right.  So you just look silly.  Hey, Ant. 
[01:26:00]  Yes.  Did you know that the Mr. Fission was actually a Krups coffee grinder?  What?  What?  It was.  It sure was.  But for those people waiting online for their Marty McFly shoes, you do have to know that  even on a hoverboard, if you're going to go on water, you still need power.  You still need power?  Yes.  You got to have a pit bull or something like that to go on water.  Yeah, yeah.  Regardless of your sneaker.  Because if you're on a hoverboard over water, it's not going to work.  It's not going to work. 
[01:26:30]  Everyone knows that.  Yo, I just want to contribute.  This is what I'm hearing right now.  Unless you got power.  There's actually a DeLorean that is made exactly like the Back to the Future one.  Stop it.  That you can rent out.  Really?  What?  I suggest that we get it for the virus show.  Please pull up in that? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wouldn't that be a banner day in history?  And that's the one that Kobe Bryant drove up to at the L.A. premiere of these shoes a few days ago.  Well, I don't like the idea of, you know, it's kind of already been done now.  So you pull up in it.  You're just another guy pulling up in it.  Yeah, but you could pull up at the virus show on the sidewalk and everybody would be like,  Ant, how are you going to get out of here?  There's no roads.  I don't need where we're going.  But we don't need roads. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  How about a train?  No.  Can I get a train?  No, that's very stupid.  A Back to the Future steam train that can actually fly?  You need massive amounts of coal.  Yes.  Well, actually, the doc could make the logs.  Right.  That, you know, have extra power.  That red log.  Yeah.  Oof.  Well, I think he used some of the extra plutonium to make the log time travel in the train. 
[01:28:00]  How did he do that?  It's technology.  I don't think he did that.  Well, where did he get red logs from?  I don't know.  He made them, though.  He was able to make them back in the 1800s.  The hell of an inventor.  I know.  No one better than Doc Brown.  I learned yesterday what the original name for that movie was.  What?  You don't know?  What?  Spaceman from Pluto.  What?  No.  And originally, it wasn't a DeLorean.  It was a refrigerator.  That's just stupid.  A refrigerator that they had to bring to a nuclear test facility to travel back in time. 
[01:28:30]  What?  To get the radiation?  To get the...  And Steven Spielberg didn't want to use a refrigerator because he was afraid that kids were going to just start jumping in refrigerators.  Into refrigerators to try to go back in time.  Did he really?  Yeah.  And that would hurt the little children.  So then they changed the name of the spacecraft.  That's so great.  Do you know who was first cast to be Marty McFly and actually had filmed some sequences?  Catherine Hepburn.  Catherine Hepburn?  No.  Danny's raising his hand. 
[01:29:00]  Danny?  Danny?  The correct answer is Eric Stoltz.  Eric Stoltz.  Very good.  And he played it a little wacky.  He was a little too Doc Brownish.  There wasn't a good contrast.  Screen caps of this because he actually filmed half of the movie with Eric Stoltz.  Yes, with Eric Stoltz.  Half the movie?  Yeah.  And then they actually recast him because they felt he was playing it too over the top.  You can go to bttf.com.  Yes.  Which of course is Back to the Future.  Have you seen the locations?  They've taken pictures of all the various locations that we used in the movie. 
[01:29:30]  So if you want to do a tour, you can actually go out and do a little tour of the actual locations from the filming.  Even Hill Valley?  Well, no.  Hill Valley tragically recently burnt down at Universal Studios' lot there in California.  So the clock tower, all that, it's gone.  It's gone.  Guess they couldn't save the clock tower, huh?  Save the clock tower!  You guys are a bunch of nerds. 
[01:30:00]  Amazing.  I'm hanging with nerds.  We'll probably continue this after the break, right?  You can continue now.  Please.  I love it.  Slacker!  Did he ever have hair?  No.  Let's just, we'll just blurt out lines.  Do I really need to swear?  Yes.  God damn it.  Oh, dad.  Dad, daddy, daddy-o.  Look.  So when do the sneakers come out officially?  I don't know. 
[01:30:30]  We're going to find out with the next, what's the haps?  What's the haps?  We're going to be at the Nike store asking the people that are standing on line to get  the Marty McFly 2015.  I'm sure they don't need any of the other shoes that are coming out.  They've got to be all there for Back to the Future.  They're just, isn't it?  They're just sneaker geeks.  They don't know anything about the movie.  I'm going to have to prove you wrong, Hope.  By the way, our own Sam likes to collect sneakers.  He's one of those guys.  Oh, yeah.  Do you?  That's one of the haps that are in his life. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  He, uh, what's your most valuable pair of sneaks?  Well, uh, from, I think my birthday, Jess got me a pair of custom made Rob Zombie Nike  Dunks, and they're awesome.  And they're, I mean, they're custom made and they look fantastic.  I think I got a picture on my MySpace.  So those are probably the most valuable ones, one of a kind.  But, I mean, I got some exclusives.  Well, how much are they?  I don't know how much they cost her.  Oh, she had them made for you.  Do you, is it a, uh, is this, is, do you wear them? 
[01:31:30]  No.  Why?  They're sneakers.  Because then they get all messed up.  So then what do you do with them?  Keep them in the box right next to my desk.  I open the box every now and then and say, that's a nice sneaker.  Well, why would you like art for him?  Well, why would you buy sneakers that you don't wear?  Because they're cool.  I can understand if, like, Michael Jordan won a championship and you happen to get those sneakers.  You put them in glass, but.  See, like, the sneakers I'm wearing now, I bought, like, in high school.  And I really liked them, but I wore them and they got all messed up.  Yeah.  So for years, I tried to find another pair. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Because these were messed up.  Uh-huh.  And Jess, the saint that she is, finally found another pair.  And so now I have a new pair of these that I don't wear.  All right, so what's the haps?  What's the haps?  You're going to be asking these guys back-to-the-future questions?  Yeah.  All right.  See if they're really worthy of owning the Marty McFly 2015.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll ask them that hoverboard question.  In 1985. 
[01:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  Which one?  I, uh, I and Jimmy.  Of course.  I and Jimmy don't get that.  Which one?  Well, there.  You guys crack yourselves up.  I don't really understand.  There could be an alternate 1985.  Ah, okay.  That happened because the sports almanac was taken back and given to Biff.  Yeah.  And of course then Biff acquired a lot of money through gambling and built the big Biff Hotel  Casino and pretty much ruined Hill Valley. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  Uh, and that was the alternative 1985.  So which one?  I'm talking about the regular 1985, Danny.  Can there be an alternative?  But good question.  Which one is some great nerd humor, huh?  Wait.  Can there be an alternative July 9th?  8 a.m.?  Yeah, please.  Me and Jimmy want to go to the other July 9th.  Yes.  Go when men are talking about giant racks.  Right.  Things of that nature.  But it does seem odd that, uh, 30 years in the future seemed a very long time in 1985 
[01:33:30]  and they came up with some pretty, uh, outlandish things.  We got seven years.  So, in seven years we have to come up with that self-drying, uh...  First thing we got to do is come out with a whole lot of Jaws movies.  Right.  They got to pump these out because we were up to 19.  And rainbow hats.  And rainbow hats and ties that are actually two ties.  Two ties, yeah.  That hang down.  Plus those freeze-dried, uh, Pizza Hut pizzas. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  And fax machines on the wall.  No internet, but fax machines on the wall.  No, fax machines on the wall where the fax that says you're fired comes out.  Read my fax.  Read my fax.  McFry!  And, of course, don't forget the fruit basket elevator.  Right.  That lowers the fruit in front of you at the table.  It's so convenient.  That was a super microwave that cooks a pizza in five seconds.  Of course!  It was already brought up, Travis.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Come on.  Stay with us here.  Stay with us.  How can we? 
[01:34:30]  It's fantastic.  I can't believe you haven't seen it 80 times like we have.  Danny and I have talked about doing an entire Saturday Night Virus show.  Just revolving around Back to the Future.  Count me in.  Yes.  I'm so there.  I don't think it has been on where I have not watched it.  I don't care if there's five minutes left.  No.  It wasn't even that good of a movie.  It's fantastic.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  It's not even that good of a movie.  No, because you're looking at it as a movie.  Not as an event. 
[01:35:00]  It's not a lifestyle.  It's a nostalgic event.  Even Back to the Future 3, which was terrible, is awesome.  Of course it is.  The over-the-top acting of Mad Dog.  Buford Mad Dog.  Buford Mad Dog.  It was fantastic.  I would not tango with that cowboy.  No.  Of course not.  What kind of a name is Clint Eastwood?  Oh, jeez.  He called himself Clint Eastwood.  What a scream. 
[01:35:30]  I know.  You're now talking about Back to the Future 3?  3, yes.  3.  Well, you know, it was a trilogy.  Am I hearing this correctly?  Oh, it was a trilogy.  So, it had to be.  And it was filmed at the same time as 2.  They actually filmed them both simultaneously.  Oh, wow.  That's why if you pay attention at the end, after the credit says,  to be continued.  Yes.  To be concluded.  The end. 
[01:36:00]  The end.  Right.  That's how it was.  To be continued after the first one.  Yeah.  Which is a little odd, too, watching the two different actresses  that played Marty's girlfriend.  I have another piece of truth.  Yes, Danny?  When Back to the Future 2 ends and it says,  to be continued, then they show a trailer for Back to the Future 3.  That was the first time that a movie ended with a trailer  for the next movie since, I think, Russ Meyer did it in the 60s.  Wow.  Wow.  Mondo Back to the Future.  Wait, hold on.  I don't think that qualifies as trivia.  Why? 
[01:36:30]  Because nobody would ever think about it.  That's almost like saying, a bit of trivia for you,  but these three windows I'm looking at, someone thought they might be four.  But then they decided to make them three.  Anything can be trivia.  This is...  No, I think Danish trivia is more evidence that Back to the Future was a groundbreaking film.  Of course.  And an achievement in cinematography.  Why was your different girlfriend?  Because Elizabeth Shue, who played the girl, I believe had prior commitments. 
[01:37:00]  No, her mother actually was diagnosed with cancer, and she spent a lot of time in camera,  so she couldn't commit to the episode.  How do you know this?  Not a very big part, though, for the girlfriend.  They had to take her back because they didn't plan on making a sequel when they finished the first one.  And when Doc comes back, of course, he says,  Marty, Marty, it's your kids.  So they had to take them both back, and then they just laid her on a bench and left her for a while.  What are they turning to...  You can't say that.  You can't say that on the air, but we know what you're going to say. 
[01:37:30]  Everyone knows the line, Travis.  I think, didn't they re-shoot some of the first movie scenes?  Yes, they did.  With the new girl, yeah.  When she walks up to Marty, as Marty's looking at his brand new truck,  his four-wheel drive 1980s truck,  at the same time Biff is waxing the car.  Of course, Biff turned out to be the guy just waxing the car.  I know.  And I like how the McFly's come back from tennis, I believe.  Yeah.  And comment on Biff. 
[01:38:00]  I hope that's the second coat of wax.  And they discuss how they met through Biff.  Right.  Through Biff's attempted rape.  Right.  Of Marty's mom.  It's like, oh, if it wasn't for Biff, we never would have met.  Oh, that's right.  He was trying to rape mom in the car.  Because that's George McFly's way of looking at Biff waxing that car  and saying, who's raping who now, Biff?  Oh, okay.  I always wondered about that.  Why would they invite the rapist? 
[01:38:30]  Right.  The man that actually was trying to rape your wife  over to your house to wax your car.  He's humiliating him.  Biff is now his manservant.  Because he is.  He walked in very excited with the books.  Yeah.  I'm just finishing it now.  Now, Biff, now, Biff, don't con me.  You got me.  You got me.  All right.  Stop it.  For the love of God, then stop.  Holy. 
[01:39:00]  Stop.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Can you tell?  Oh, that is holy.  Just stop.  Can you tell we like the movie?  Get us out of here, Iraq.  Opie and Anthony, we just had an observation.  Channel 11, the hack news here in New York City.  Local news station here in New York City.  They're extremely hack. 
[01:39:30]  No, they're not.  They're a professional news organization that employs wonderful people.  I know you have to say that because you're dating the lovely Jill Nicolini,  the traffic vixen, who does a very good job with the traffic, by the way.  Of course she does.  But the rest of them, they're a bunch of hacks.  No, they're very nice, and they do a fine job.  They just like to get silly.  Right.  They're hacks.  No.  How could they be hacks?  They should go back to broadcasting school.  They do.  No. 
[01:40:00]  Look at this guy.  What is he doing?  He's at a beach as they build sandcastles.  That's not the news.  They're a bunch of hacks.  That's his job.  He goes out and does various things.  His job is what?  I don't even know what he does.  That's Larry Huff.  He goes around and he does kind of the, you know, I'm going to be out and about.  You know, today I'm at the sandcastle building thing.  How about this?  He's too old to be out and about.  What is he doing?  Hey, look.  They're my pals. 
[01:40:30]  See?  Anyway, the hacky news channel here in New York.  Channel 11.  What?  The CW.  They had Adrienne Barbeau on.  Adrienne Barbeau.  You might remember her.  Yeah, this is for maybe the older listeners.  But she used to be quite the looker back in the day with the big boobies.  She was on Maud.  She played Maud's daughter.  Oh, my God.  Creepshow.  Yeah.  Remember that?  I remember all that, but I didn't remember she was on Maud.  Yeah.  And she was in a fine film called Creepshow. 
[01:41:00]  Sure.  That if Danny and the rest of the boys want to come in, we can discuss that movie ad nauseum.  No.  Tomorrow.  I promise we'll give you that tomorrow.  Escape from New York.  Escape from New York.  Squeeze.  Yes.  Yes.  Quite the career.  Well, Channel 11 got to interview her because they're like normal human beings.  We were going to interview her, but I actually asked Roland if she would mind if we asked her 
[01:41:30]  all about her boobs and things we could do with her boobs, and I guess that was a no-no,  so we're not going to have Adrienne Barbell on her show, and we could have had her.  Could have had her.  Well, we had to go down that dumb road.  So, a little observation.  She's getting interviewed on this, quote, news outlet here in New York, and because she's  no...  Wow.  What movie is that from?  Swamp Thing.  Swamp Thing.  She's completely naked in the swamp?  Why?  Why would you be completely naked in the swamp? 
[01:42:00]  Because she's got those boobs.  They really are lovely.  Yeah, because they're natural.  They're big teardrops.  Big heavy teardrops.  You want to hold them and go, holy mackerel.  That's what I do with big breasts.  I hold them and I go, holy Toledo.  What does the girl do when you're doing this?  She goes...  She usually...  Sometimes wake up.  Yeah.  Put them, boom.  You know what a guy wants?  You want heavy without the sag. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Which is very...  It's very rare.  So, A.J. M. Barbeau is on Channel 11, and because she's known for having the big boobies,  now that she's an older woman, she still has to show the old woman cleavage.  Because that's what she was known for.  And I was looking at Anthony, I'm like, you know, like, God sucks that he allows us to  just rot away.  That's what we do the second you're born.  Like, that is just a cruel thing to give us humans, you know, the ability to just rot 
[01:43:00]  in front of everybody else.  You have to rot.  As they continue just bringing youth into the equation.  Yeah.  You get older and you rot and there's beautiful things around you constantly.  That sucks.  The beauty of you, by the way, is that you point out how wrong God is.  Not with starvation, or AIDS babies, or murder, but because Adrienne Barbeau's breasts have  begun sagging.  Sure.  That makes you question God.  There is no God. 
[01:43:30]  She shouldn't have to show off her old woman cleavage.  She should be able to have the young, nice body.  She's got like one foot of powder smelling cleavage now, you know.  Yeah.  It smells like Johnson's baby powder, old person mothballs.  And I understand we have to die.  I get that concept.  But why not keep it simple?  Where the outside of you stays young and youthful.  Yeah.  Whatever your prime.  And you should decide what your prime is.  Like, I want to be that magic age of 27. 
[01:44:00]  Seems to be a good one.  I want to be 27 for my entire life, but the inside of me could rot.  Let the inside rot away.  So the inside starts rotting.  But on the outside, you still look like a 27-year-old kid.  But at 75 or 80, you're like having a hard time performing.  And you can't really use the toilet very well.  And you get Alzheimer's.  What happens?  Well, I don't know. 
[01:44:30]  I don't have this.  You don't have that all figured out yet?  I just want to at least look young.  Things inside could continue rotting and slowly.  The blatant vanity problem you have.  It's just ridiculous.  Oh, like I'm the only one?  Come on.  It just sucks to get old.  That time is a bitch.  We say it a lot on this show.  Time is a bitch.  I blew up my voice making you guys stop the Back to the Future thing.  See?  All right.  Hey, moving on. 
[01:45:00]  So no Adrienne Barbeau because I guess we insulted her by asking if we could ask her about her boobs and nothing and nothing else.  Our pal Larry, Larry King, was doing something wonderful yesterday on the show.  Oh, dying.  Oh.  Yeah.  In their first get-together.  Oh, God, what a tool.  I think we announced that yesterday Ringo was celebrating his 68th birthday.  Was he?  Was he the oldest Beatle, I guess?  Because isn't Paul only... 
[01:45:30]  65?  65, 66?  Yeah.  I know he pissed the...  What the hell is wrong with me?  Don't answer that.  Um, past, I was trying to say.  The famous 64.  Anyway, Larry had to sing Ringo a little happy birthday.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  Larry, you gonna give him a little Beatles happy birthday?  Can you have this?  You want me to do that, really?  Yeah, come on, Larry.  Yeah, Larry, Larry, open up. 
[01:46:00]  Happy birthday.  All right, baby.  Wish I had you drumming behind me.  Can you...  Happy birthday?  Why?  What's drumming and the happy birthday?  Oh, I thought he wanted some gay love.  He meant with Ringo's hands on his back.  Oh, playing bongos on my shoulders.  Come on, Larry.  Come on.  Ugh, this isn't gonna end well.  Happy birthday.  All right, baby.  Wish I had you drumming behind me.  Can you...  Happy birthday to you. 
[01:46:30]  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Ringo.  Peace and love, and happy birthday to you.  Oh, my gosh.  Not bad.  That was a first.  Wait, can I ask why she's reacting?  Peace and love, God bless.  Thank you.  Okay, baby.  Why is she reacting like this craziness is happening?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's insane.  Whoa, we got the scoop.  Larry sang.  Did you hear that?  No one cares. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, my.  Yeah.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things, Larry King is singing happy birthday.  And Ringo's smiling because he knew George Harrison's holding his head going, ouch.  Will you leave him alone?  Just leave the guy alone. 
[01:47:30]  Paul McCartney's holding his seven legs.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, Larry King is singing, happy birthday.  You should see the two remaining faces in the Yankees' dugout.  Oh, my God.  You're crazy.  You're nuts.  Oh, God. 
[01:48:00]  I don't know why I find that hysterical every time.  It's a hoot, 100% of the time.  A hoot.  Is this true?  Jeff M. from Staten Island is writing that Adrian Barbeau was featured in my favorite movie, Mondo Topless.  Mondo Topless?  Oh, no.  No.  Really?  When I'm doing the Topless. 
[01:48:30]  Give me my Russ Myers clips.  You know, there's a lot of things.  You didn't say Topless right.  See, now I'm with you.  You know how you were doing the Back to the Future?  Yeah.  I'm all about Mondo Topless.  It's the Topless.  When I'm...  Doing the Topless.  Doing the Topless.  The Topless.  Beautiful Pat Barrington.  Pat Barrington.  Ugh.  Her name...  She's hot, but her name has a sexy peel of an anvil. 
[01:49:00]  Pat Barrington.  Pat Barrington Ironworks.  Yeah, a lot of confusion.  Because you expect an old broad and it's...  It's Pat Barrington.  It's Pat Barrington.  It sounds like an Irish bar somewhere.  We're going to Pat Barrington's place.  I'll see you there.  Catch a drink.  Right.  Gonna have an Irish week at Pat Barrington.  Oh, God.  That's great.  God damn George Harris.  I can't get enough of him in his head. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, but...  Jimmy makes a great point.  I'm going to the end again because the excitement.  Who's overexcited?  I forgot.  I recognize the voice.  Is that old stroke face?  You know, the one with the facelift that really hasn't...  What?  Greta's on Fox.  Greta?  Oh, Greta's on Fox.  It sounds like her, no?  All right.  I don't know.  All right.  Listen to the excitement.  Happy birthday, dear Ringo. 
[01:50:00]  Peace and love and happy birthday to you.  Oh, my gosh.  Not bad.  That was a first.  I love it.  It was a first.  He's 90.  He's never sang happy birthday to anybody.  He sang that to Christ.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, exactly.  He's got seven wives and he's got kids.  That's the first time he sang happy birthday.  Ringo's heard it.  Larry has sung it.  We've all heard it.  It was a first for nobody.  Yeah.  It was an 800,000th. 
[01:50:30]  She should have said it.  It was a non-event miss.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Babbitt Bardot was in Mondo Topless.  Yeah, that's not Adrian Barbo.  No.  Oh, we got...  Beautiful Babbitt.  Look, we...  I understand there's some faithfuls out there and they're like, why again?  But it's just one of our favorite things.  Russ Myers, Mondo Topless.  And what's weird is we started talking about this again last week and it turned out the  guy who did the over-the-top announcing died very recently because we were trying to get 
[01:51:00]  him on the show.  You're kidding.  He died like a week before we went down this road again.  Yeah.  You want to hear the intro for Pat Barringer?  Pat Barringer.  Oh, it's Barringer.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's Barr...  Yeah.  And then we got the...  Babbitt Bardot.  Babbitt.  Reving up on runway number one is punctuous Pat Barringer, a magnificently configured female  skilled in the art of the topless.  I beg you to try to listen to what she has to say. 
[01:51:30]  All that you're doing is a dance.  It has no meaning whatsoever.  However, there are gyrations and so on, suggestive movements, but still it is entertainment and  there is no other meaning other than a dance.  I got to tell you something.  Yeah.  The internet has desensitized all of us because the excitement of this crap back then because  it wasn't everywhere.  I got goosebumps listening to this guy.  My God.  My God.  He's topless.  Right. 
[01:52:00]  Holy crap.  Now you just turn on your computer and you see nakedness.  You see two girls, one cup.  You really had to go out of your way to get this nakedness.  I defy you to even breathe watching her topless body.  When I'm doing the topless, my gyrations.  That's when the girls talk, but I want to get the intro clips.  As you were saying that, dude, I was thinking the same thing.  If you saw this in the theater in the 60s, do you know how many guys must have just cranked  in the theater watching this? 
[01:52:30]  Dude, I got goosebumps, man.  It gets you excited to see the topless.  The topless.  The topless.  The topless.  The topless.  Uh, you want to know what a girl must possess?  Of course.  I don't even know where to go.  There's so many places here with this.  What must a girl possess to measure up as a topless dancer?  She must have a body well above the average in physical beauty, unblemished by an uneven suntan,  together with a bust line that is firm and youthful.  The topless dancer's face as well must bear an equal burden with the body, encouraging 
[01:53:00]  sensuous and provocative expression, supplementing her physically exciting figure.  Let it be known.  We just played that clip.  Extremely, uh, I can't even say the word, but we can't say poop.  No.  Dopey lawyers.  Well, that was nice and, uh, that was, uh, it was sexual, but it was, um, it was beyond  sexual.  This, this, this innocence that comes with this is like, look at, look at me. 
[01:53:30]  Goosebumps.  Ah.  What do you want next?  Well, he's holy.  I can't believe the pair of on this one.  Hey guys, losing his mind.  I love it.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm going to get that.  There's an equal burden.  The face.  Right.  Oh my God.  How is a face going to bear an equal burden with those.  She's got losing his mind.  He's wrong about them needing those qualities.  I've been in places where, you know, one's missing due to a shark attack. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, I know.  Horrible.  Yeah.  He makes them sound like, yeah, they're all goddesses.  You ever been to Ronkonkoma at Bird's Place?  Ugh.  Yeah, but they do some fine tricks.  Battle wounds.  I used to like the, uh, the match trick they used to do there.  Yeah, yeah.  That was all right.  Listen, here's, uh, Babette Bardot.  Hang on, men, and zero in on bouncy Babette Bardot.  French and Swedish.  50-50 where it counts.  Speak to us, Babette baby.  Babette. 
[01:54:30]  Babette.  Baby, speak to us.  Almost sounded like dice.  Babette, baby.  I got my c*** in my hands.  50-50 where it counts.  It counts.  Speak to us, Babette baby.  I try to project a childlike to a woman quality.  Because I do believe that men don't like so much odd sex.  They like softness also.  So I try to project both sexuality and also gentleness. 
[01:55:00]  So I do always stop my act more or less in a very gentle way.  Shut the f*** up and show us your c***.  All right, who do you want to hear next?  You got Darlene Gray, you got Darlene Gray, Luscious Sin, Darla Paris, Diane Young, Donna X.  Diane Young.  Come on, Diane Young.  There's Diane Young.  What an awful...  Herbert Hoover.  Here's Diane Young.  Settle back and let yummy Diane Young entertain you. 
[01:55:30]  Blondely beautiful.  And while you're about it, lend her your ear.  I used to play a cello in a symphony orchestra when I was 13.  Did you?  Did you really?  What did an uncle do?  Break the cello over your head one night while he was attacking you?  Steve from Bay Show's got a couple of great names.  Madge Peabody and Eunice Frump.  They really are the unsexiest stripper names ever. 
[01:56:00]  Let's bring out Edna McGillicuddy.  All right, Biscuit Eater.  Nice one.  The Bouncy Agnes Weinstein.  They're coming up with some good ones.  Here's one of the girls talking about the trouble with the pasties.  The pasties.  To wear pasties, you know, you have to put on all that glue.  And it's so hard to get off. 
[01:56:30]  And sometimes the pasties slip.  And then the glue shows.  Sometimes they fall off.  That's terrible.  She sounded kind of sexy.  They're all about making sure the pasties fall off.  Yes.  Oh.  A lot of people saying this is where Larry King got his voice from.  I like men.  Well-built men.  Skinny, scrawny men. 
[01:57:00]  No.  But he-men.  Look like men.  And I don't like the long hair look at all.  I can't stand guys who go around with long hair.  I didn't even really need to wear a bra until I was halfway through junior high school.  It all came late, but it was there, boy.  No denying it.  Yeah.  Oh, dear Lord. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, no denying it.  Did we do Darlene?  Bring out the lovely Erica Nagel.  That's mad man.  That's very funny, mad man.  Erica Nagel.  Did we do Darlene Gray yet?  Hey, you bastard.  Wow, wow, wow.  The beautiful Jill Nicolini.  Did we do Darlene Gray?  I don't remember. 
[01:58:00]  No, we didn't do Darlene.  Ready to entertain you as Bucks out at Darlene Gray.  England's answer to the biggest and the best.  What do you say, Darlene?  No, I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  Wow.  That's amazing.  That was a big scoop.  Look how excited we are, though, man.  Erica Nagel.  Right.  The beautiful Erica Nagel. 
[01:58:30]  The Bucksonic Erica Nagel.  I defy you to breathe while he talks to you.  And away we go with Lutthes and Lene.  Both and mindsome.  Give us a word, Sim.  I can be around anything green and have a feeling, a sensation run through my body  only because it is a feeling of nature.  It is a feeling of freedom.  That's terrible. 
[01:59:00]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry, Eric.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  Oh, my God.  She's as dumb as she is in confidence.  I didn't mean to. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, uh...  Erica Nagel.  This Bucksonic...  Settle down, gentlemen, as old dumpster comes.  This Bucksonic buffoon will gyrate for you.  I've got to play this clip.  I love this.  Copenhagen is the supreme Scandinavian city for the pleasure seeker. 
[02:00:00]  Let us hurry inside the famed Atlantic Palace for an unforgettable experience.  Greta Thorwald, a Nordic nymph.  Greta Thorwald?  That's right, Bucksonic.  Alice Stakehold.  She's a hundred today.  You're doing the birthday smuckers thing.  She's on the smuckers chart.  On the news.  One of the Mondo topless girls.  From Loudoun, Tennessee, Alice Stakehold. 
[02:00:30]  What beautiful Harriet Goldman.  She has glasses and looks like Eli Wallach.  Hailey Mae Barnes.  Also known as Scatman Crothers.  This 107-year-old will entertain you.  How about a little soft shoe, bitch?  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha! 
[02:01:00]  All right, listen.  Wait, we've got to hear this name again.  Let us hurry inside the famed Atlantic Palace for an unforgettable experience.  Greta Thorwald, the Nordic nymph, whose pulcritude is unrivaled by any showgirl in Denmark.  Her youthful bosom, flat stomach, firm hips, and smooth, lithe legs  all seem to unite in her wildly exotic dance,  which she delivers in a burst of uninhibited frenzy. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, my God.  We're going to have a race to the bathroom.  He just makes it sound so good.  By the way, someone on Instant Feedback, this is an old bit.  Hater! Hater! Hater!  Ah, don't worry about it. Shut up.  Go away, hater! Go away!  You ever watch a movie twice?  Go away, hater!  Or 1,500 times if it starts Michael J. Fox.  By the way, to the dopey haters out there,  we ban you from Instant Feedback for hating.  Ban, ban, ban.  Less hating. More love. 
[02:02:00]  Hater! Hater! Go away!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The venomous voices of the vastly vulgar airwaves.  Introducing the Destroyer.  Operator of the OCD organization, Opie.  The Professor.  The know-it-all neurotic Nancy Anthony.  Swing over to little Jimmy Dorton.  The worthless, chinless, box-a-master of laugh.  Meet the irritating extra of excrement E-Rock.  Or the swishy audio shim Steve C. 
[02:02:30]  And don't forget Sam.  Black and white.  50-50 where it counts.  Corrupting the cavities of hear-holes everywhere.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony.  Another good one today.  We've got a choice here.  Got some A-Rod news.  Or more Mondo Topless clips.  I love that Mondo Topless. 
[02:03:00]  You know what's funny for the people that write and call and go,  we heard this before.  You don't think we have?  But it's fun for us to do it again.  Yeah, we've heard it before.  We're laughing.  Right.  These guys are telling us something we don't know.  Yeah.  Well, we figure if we're doing it again and enjoying ourselves,  that someone out there is also enjoying it.  Oh, wow.  I was just handed another disc of Mondo Topless clips that we've never played before.  Ooh. 
[02:03:30]  We'll save this for another day.  Another day.  Gigi Latouche?  One of the girls' names.  Gigi Latouche.  We've got to hear one.  All right, all right, all right.  Here's our A-Rod news, by the way.  You've got a stripper up there in Boston, Candice Houlihan.  Candice Houlihan.  Caught A-Rod's attention at a Red Sox game in Boston.  Of course in Boston.  She was heckling him.  He went over to the stands and asked her out.  That's what she's saying.  They spent two nights together. 
[02:04:00]  Yes.  Another woman coming out of the woodwork.  She looks like a little slut.  Oh, was that at the game?  I thought that was at the strip club that she met in.  According to what I got in front of me,  she was heckling him, and he went over to the stands and asked her out.  They spent two nights together.  Then she felt bad when she found out his wife was pregnant.  Told her friends that he was well-endowed and a gentleman.  Three months later, during the ALCS, they hooked up again,  and she credits her talents for reversing the curse. 
[02:04:30]  What?  Wow.  Candice Houlihan.  So she's saying that she kind of threw his game off?  Wow.  I guess so.  She sucked a championship right out of New York.  A good girl.  That's a talent.  All right.  What do you want to hear, Jimmy?  You want to hear Gigi Latouche?  Yeah.  A little Gigi.  The buxom Patricia O'Neal.  All right, we... 
[02:05:00]  Buxotic Bobbett Kelly.  That's right, dude.  I'm going to start with this one, actually.  I was wearing beads, as I recall, around the neck  and a black patent belt at the waist  with a rather scanty bottom G-string.  I was doing some sort of wild Watusi or something.  A wild Watusi? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Wow, I can only imagine what that looked like.  Oh, yeah.  Buxotic.  All right, here's Gigi.  Paris, seductive female that she is,  has played mistress to the world for centuries.  Saints and sinners from all corners of the earth  have been lured to her bosom by her siren song,  eager to indulge in her many sensual pleasures.  Let's high away to Blas Pigalle,  the wild and lustful monument to sexual eroticism, 
[02:06:00]  and drop into La Sphinx,  and thrill to the wantonest of Gigi Latouche,  the girl with the throbbing guitar.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, hey.  Throbbing guitar, what?  You know.  Gigi Latouche?  You need props.  We have like that,  come and see producer Stevie the Douche.  Steve C. the Douche.  Steve C. the Douche. 
[02:06:30]  We should just show how times have changed  and go into some of these strip clubs in New York  and do this exact thing.  See how quickly we get kicked out.  Yes.  With the ever-increasing popularity of skin diving,  it has only reached...  What the hell is skin diving?  Skin diving.  What the hell is skin diving?  With Louise C.K.  I never get... 
[02:07:00]  Steve.  You know what's weird about Mondo Topless?  I've seen it...  Seriously, I've seen Mondo Topless  probably two dozen times, okay?  I've never made it to the end of the movie.  Nah, why would you?  She's really sexy, this one.  So I never got to the point  where he talks about skin diving before.  Yeah.  Yeah, these girls...  She's a looker.  Oh, boy, is she.  With the ever-increasing popularity of skin diving,  it is only reasonable to conclude  that the Topless would become 
[02:07:30]  a very important adjunct to the sport.  With very little training,  the novice can learn to use her breathing apparatus  below the surface of the water quite readily.  And many relaxing and satisfying moments  can be achieved,  particularly when amateur motion pictures  are employed to record the pleasurable event.  All right, I did get to the skin diving part  of Mondo Topless.  I was reminded by when I heard that clip.  It's just a whole segment on Mondo Topless,  girls going under the water Topless. 
[02:08:00]  Skin diving.  That's what skin diving is.  Yes.  In Europe, men and women are together,  and they feel like make love,  they aren't going to make love.  And in America, well, they go in a roundabout way  asking, well, you want to see my stamp collection?  If he wants to see a stamp collection, fine.  But he wants to make love,  whatever he should tell us.  There shouldn't be no shame in wanting to make love.  Like, there's no shame in wanting to eat steak  or drink water or milk or liquor or whatever. 
[02:08:30]  On the other hand, I do not like a rude approach.  A man can always be very romantic.  And a man can always seduce a woman if he knows how,  because most of the time,  a woman gets seduced much more mentally at first.  But if that's what he wants,  he should seduce and not talk about his stamp collection.  Stamp collection?  Who the hell has a stamp collection?  And what guy tells a girl,  you want to see my stamp collection  to get her over the house?  Right. 
[02:09:00]  Apparently it would work.  She's saying, you know,  you don't have to say that.  If you want to show them the stamp collection,  just say that.  But if you want to have sex,  just say, hey,  you want to come over and have some sex?  Right.  Don't beat around the bush.  Right.  Just beat that.  Let's meet Abunda.  Berlin today is a city divided.  With the eastern sector under the cruel domination of communism  and West Berlin part of the free world.  located only a stone's throw from the fashionable 
[02:09:30]  Kurfürstendamm,  the Broadway of Berlin.  The Broadway of Berlin.  The Broadway of Berlin, huh?  Broadway of Berlin.  we encounter the Fairlady Film Bar,  where Abunda Vita,  the bosom bountiful,  is about to begin her act of primitive passion.  Capacity crowds flock to see Abunda Vita,  fantastically developed,  exercise her magnificent pectoral pulchritude, 
[02:10:00]  as she wantonly entertains the sporting crowds of Berlin  with fierce intensity.  Ick benign whore.  He can't even get to the end of the sentence.  He's so excited.  He's just...  Come see this volvacious Jew hater.  Wow.  Is that her?  She's buxom.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, is she.  She is like one of those typical...  Wow.  ...big German girls. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can have an older face, though.  Well, that's the heavy without the sag  that we were talking about.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Lovely Ava Braun.  This is Abunda talking.  The guys that don't know how to dance,  and they should,  whenever they come over to the apartment,  I'm always trying to teach them new steps  and how to dance,  and they're very inhibited...  The goose step.  ...to self-conscious, 
[02:11:00]  and they want to have a few drinks.  Watch her dance her way  through the Warsaw Ghetto.  She's doing dancing lessons at home.  God bless her.  Imagine how hot you got to be  to have guys come over the house,  her apartment,  and dance.  You want to meet...  We're running out of show, unfortunately.  You want to meet Heidi Richter.  Heidi Richter.  Another sexy name.  They didn't have that figured out.  Richter?  I barely knew her! 
[02:11:30]  Hamburg is the second largest city  in West Germany,  and continental Europe's  most vital harbor.  Let's journey uptown  to the Casino de Paris,  the perfect place  to cast Anchorage for pleasure,  and peek in on Heidi Richter,  a tall, blonde, Aryan beauty  of perfect proportion.  And watch her as she squirms  and rides topless  on a luxurious bed,  contorting her supple body  in a manner which defies description. 
[02:12:00]  He can't even describe it.  It defies description.  She put her head right up her...  This is...  This is how...  This is how Heidi Richter sounds.  He just wanted to take  some pictures of me  at first,  and then all of a sudden  he asked me,  would you like to be a playmate  or try for Playboy magazine?  And so I thought of her,  so no, never, you know. 
[02:12:30]  But then, I don't know,  it changed my mind, but...  Money.  I just tried for it,  and I didn't make it.  The reason being that  this is what they said,  that my bust line was too big.  Her bust line.  My bust line was too big.  That's the most unsexy way  to describe boobs.  The bust line.  My bust line.  When I'm doing the tabless,  my bust line.  I can't find that clip.  Her breasts are not that big. 
[02:13:00]  No.  They're kind of tight.  No!  I think they turned her down  for other reasons.  Yeah, because she was on...  They were trying to be pure  back then with their topless...  Yes!  They are men  who do not respond.  Some of them either talk  or look there to fall asleep.  So I believe either  they don't like girls  or I don't know  what's in their mind.  They do know  this is burlesque.  So naturally,  I try to ignore it,  although, you know,  I find this pretty frustrating. 
[02:13:30]  This happens so seldom,  but naturally,  it does bother me  when it happens.  I see men falling asleep  while he's talking too much.  Who the hell's gonna  fall asleep back then  when they're doing  the art of the topless?  What is wrong with you?  Right.  Some drunk at a bar.  Some crap hole  in Germany.  And you're falling asleep.  Guys, it's stein  after stein of beer.  He just falls asleep  on the bar.  Yeah.  She's shaking her stuff. 
[02:14:00]  Wonderful.  BJ the hater.  Hater!  Hater!  Go away, hater!  By the way,  dope,  these are brand new clips  never played on our show.  Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.  Less hating,  more love.  Haters,  go away!  We meet  Yvette.  Le Grand.  Plus,  Begale has no corner  on the thrill market  of Paris.  Just as naughty  and nice  is the Etoile area,  which boasts  such famous night spots  as  the Lido,  Le Sexy, 
[02:14:30]  and the  Piste Resistance  dance of niteries  hot-lighting  the topless.  The world-famous  Crazy Horse Saloon.  Witnessing  the passionate  performance  of vivacious  Yvette Le Grand  is a never-to-be-forgotten  delight.  So let's look in  on this  buxom brunette,  the most curvaceous  cowgirl  in the western world  as she  tempestuously  tosses her torso  in the most sizzling  topless spectacle  ever brought  to the Crazy Horse Saloon.  Noah's brilliant  about this guy.  Every description 
[02:15:00]  is completely  different from  the one he did.  Yeah.  And they're all  the greatest woman  ever, ever.  Right.  Like, there's not...  One's gotta be  better than the other,  but this one  is the bestest.  Remember what I told you?  That one was the bestest.  Forget what I said.  Remember what I said  about beautiful Babette?  Right.  I was bullcrapping you.  We're just about done.  This is Yvette  talking about  bosom control.  I have perfectly  good control  of my bosom.  I can move them. 
[02:15:30]  And I can do  also tassel work,  but with this  I don't believe  it's very sexist.  I don't do it.  I try to do  movement like  a man and a woman  are in a bedroom  and the woman  is being seduced  and I try to do  very soft  and also  sensuous movement.  Yeah.  All right.  And finally,  the end of  Mondotopolis  with the sign-off.  I don't think  we ever play  the sign-off.  Maybe we end  every show  with this now. 
[02:16:00]  We'll see you guys  tomorrow.  We'll end with this.  Well,  Mondotopolis  measures up.  The unmistakable  Russ Meyer touch  makes this more  than a gang  of great gals.  It makes it move.  We sincerely hope  that you enjoyed  the flick.  That's how it ended.  Anticlimactic.  Yeah,  big time.  Well,  you have no more 
[02:16:30]  fluids in your body.  Yeah,  you're all just  a bunch of guys  slip sliding  out of the theater.  Right.  What do you say  at the end?  He probably is saying  because he knows  nobody's left.  Right.  I hope he's doing  the flick.  The one person  still actually  watching this garbage.  And he's dehydrated  from all the saliva  he used  introducing the girls.  Everyone just needs  fluids at this point.  Erica Nagel.  Yeah.  I'm a lovely. 
[02:17:00]  All right,  guys,  we're off to XM.  Bye-bye.  The last time  I saw a pair of jugs  that big two hillbillies  were blowing up.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Get a wow sticker,  get flashed,  get happy.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  And here we are  at XM Satellite Radio  with a fine audience  outside the studio.  Get a few more people.  You guys get to come in here.  Might be just short 
[02:17:30]  of enough people  to come in the studio  with the bleachers.  Remember when I started  the whole Red Alert  a few,  what is it,  about two weeks ago  and people were like,  oh,  it's another dumb thing  by Opie trying  to get everyone talking.  and he's just  trying to create chatter.  Don't buy into it.  Does this all the time.  Who said that?  I'm trying to think  of who said that.  The haters,  which are going to go away.  Trust me,  they're going away.  But there's changes 
[02:18:00]  happening.  We all know that.  The merger  might go through,  might not in the very near future.  We don't know  who our new boss  is going to be.  This is a time  to be concerned.  We have a year  left on our contract  and we haven't heard  a word.  We were supposed  to hear something  July 1st.  We did not.  That doesn't mean  we're being fired  to let go.  But there's other things  that are way more important  and they'll get to us  eventually.  I don't think  they can do that.  I got a huge announcement.  A huge announcement. 
[02:18:30]  It's not going to hit  for another 15 or 20 minutes,  maybe an hour.  But our good friend,  our confidant,  the guy that got this show  better than any person  ever got  the O.P. and Anthony show,  understood it,  knew how to market it,  knew how to make sure  the company capitalized  on what we were able  to bring  is leaving  XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, no.  Steve Carleeson? 
[02:19:00]  Yes, I'm going  to the Gay TV channel  and he'll walk in.  Steve, comment,  yes, Gay TV.  Yes, I'm working  at Logo now.  And gay.  He's actually  a very good friend of mine.  I don't know  if that has been  kind of translated  through the radio show,  but he really is  a very good friend  of mine as well.  Eric Logan is leaving  XM Satellite Radio  and Eric just called us  to give us the heads up, 
[02:19:30]  which I respect  because there's  a press release  that's coming out  within 15, 20,  maybe a half hour  from right now,  and he wanted us  to know before  everyone else knows.  What a guy.  This is breaking news.  Our pal,  our friend Eric Logan  is leaving  for an opportunity  of a lifetime.  I don't know  if we're allowed to say  what the opportunity is yet,  but it'll be well known  within the next half hour  what that opportunity is.  It's an amazing opportunity.  I'd say he's starting  a website for donkey porn. 
[02:20:00]  He's been working on it  for years in his basement.  It's a donkey porn website.  Elo's always been  a donkey porn fan  ever since those  bachelor parties  in Tijuana.  Yeah, but  this is extremely good news  for Eric Logan.  Not so good news  for the Opie and Anthony show.  Not so good news.  Not so good news  for us.  But I knew something was up  because he's been  blowing me off  a lot lately,  and I've been like  kind of screaming  through the BlackBerry. 
[02:20:30]  Like, what the fuck, dude?  I know something's up.  You've got to give me something.  And he would just  ignore the emails  and all that.  And now it's very obvious  why he was doing that.  Yeah.  And I think Mr. Logan  saw the writing on the wall  as far as the merger goes,  and I think...  The writing was literally...  It said,  Eric Logan,  get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  You're going to be fired.  Somebody spray-painted it,  and he immediately  thought it was that guy  who runs the Spanish channel,  you know,  because he's a racist,  and he says spray-painters  are always Spanish people. 
[02:21:00]  I would say,  Eric, why do you talk that way?  Ah, Eric Logan.  When this merger goes through,  there's going to be  a whole new management structure,  and I've been hearing  that not many conversations  went on with Mr. Logan,  which is insane.  Completely insane.  Well, he's a CEO  in training this, Eric Logan,  and I think he was not going to,  you know,  wait around to get bad news  and decided,  all right, look,  I'm a very valuable commodity. 
[02:21:30]  That's right.  In the,  in the,  in media.  In the booze industry.  That's right, right.  If you hear like a weeping,  it's the guy who runs Coors.  Yeah.  He's been sober  for a very long time,  my friend.  Exactly.  He hasn't crashed a car  in a very long time.  So he's not stupid.  He's like,  you know what?  Well,  look,  I'm going to go,  I'm going to go get  the opportunity of a lifetime,  and Mr. Logan  has done just that,  and I'm not happy  whatsoever about this. 
[02:22:00]  I'm happy for him,  though.  I'm happy for him,  absolutely.  Look,  if Malcolm's in the bottom line,  people tend to bring in  their own people.  It's just the way it works,  and,  you know,  Eric's a smart guy,  and if he has a great job,  why wouldn't he take it?  He'd be dumb not to do this.  He'd be a dummy not to do it.  It's a great,  it's,  it's,  it's,  it's,  it's,  it's Harpo.  All right,  it's Harpo.  Wow.  Fuck the press release.  Fuck everybody.  That's right.  Eric Logan is going to be running Harpo.  He's becoming a Marx brother.  Yes.  That's right.  He's becoming a Marx brother.  He fought to be Chico. 
[02:22:30]  They said,  no,  you're too dumb to be Groucho.  Right.  We'll give you this one.  Yeah.  He probably thinks it's Harpo,  but it's really Zeppo,  and it's just an awful,  awful place.  You know,  we were supposed to wait,  but fuck it.  He's going to be Oprah Winfrey's  right-hand man,  literally running Harpo Entertainment.  That is fucking huge.  We'll never see him again,  because,  no,  I don't think there's a place for us.  No.  No.  Harpo.  He only applied for that,  because he wanted to be the dean  of that school.  Oh, 
[02:23:00]  over in Africa?  Yeah.  He applied for that.  Eric Logan,  our pal,  our friend,  our conference,  is going to be running Harpo.  There you go.  Don't need a press release now.  It'll be everywhere.  There it is.  Holy shit.  Fuck.  Oh, well.  Once the merger went through,  anyway,  I don't think he was going to be around,  to tell you the truth.  Which is stupid.  Oh, yeah.  I can say it. 
[02:23:30]  Anthony's not saying it.  I'm saying it.  I'm the dummy.  No, I didn't say it's stupid.  It's stupid that he wouldn't be  basically running the new company,  or at least, like,  one rung down from the top.  They got their people.  Yeah.  You know?  They got their people over there.  But, um,  hmm.  Hmm.  You know,  I know, uh,  I know what Eric Logan could do now.  Hmm.  Because he still has the power.  Okay, porn.  What?  No.  No.  Stripping.  Give us the Howard Stern contract 
[02:24:00]  before you leave.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, sign us to some ridiculous contract  before you leave.  Four days a week.  Ridiculous money.  Stock options.  Yeah, why didn't he do that?  Eight weeks of vacation.  You know, Logan,  you say how much of a friend you are.  Come on, Nilo.  I know you still have the power.  You could,  you could sign off on that right now.  Come on.  He's a bit of a lame duck.  Yeah, perhaps they wouldn't  take him seriously 
[02:24:30]  and actually let the contract go through.  Yeah.  So, uh,  there's the big news  that's gonna hit the wire.  The AP.  And Orbitcast  in mere moments.  Go to Orbitcast.  Did we scoop everybody yet?  I don't think we did.  It was announced  at six o'clock this morning.  Was it really?  Yeah.  You're kidding.  No, I'm kidding.  Oh.  Um,  I guess there's only one thing to do.  Um,  Eric Logan's plane  was shot down  over the Sea of Japan.  It spun in.  There were no survivors. 
[02:25:00]  Will we be hearing  from Mr. Logan today  after the announcement?  No.  What are you kidding?  He can't associate  with the likes of this program.  No.  We're shock jocks.  If that's the job he's doing,  why would he ever admit  that he was on this program?  I know.  He can't even,  yeah.  He'll be like,  Opie and Andy?  Yeah.  I think I've heard of this show.  It was something bad  at a church.  But aside from that,  no.  I don't even know  who they are.  I only listened.  I thought it was  Oprah and Anthony.  My mistake.  Yes.  You'll see him live  somewhere at some event 
[02:25:30]  and go,  oh,  Elo!  And he'll just be like,  who,  what?  Usher him away.  Man,  with that said,  how many people  did we listen to  in our careers?  Really?  I know you're making  a lot of jokes,  but seriously.  No one.  Was he pretty much  the only person  we ever listened to?  Plenty of times  I didn't listen to him either.  I'm just being honest.  I'm not even joking.  But,  yeah.  So,  there's only one.  I always respected  his advice.  I didn't always agree with it. 
[02:26:00]  Didn't always take it.  Right.  But,  you know.  Well,  you do know the,  also respected  his ability  to drink.  Yeah.  I was sad  when he went dry.  We lost another one,  Danny.  I hate that.  He didn't agree  with our suspension,  which was a tough time  for our relationship.  He's like,  dudes,  trust me,  I'm not in on this one,  but I have no choice.  Right now,  he's going,  I completely agreed  with their suspension,  and he's trying  to backpedal.  Elo has to call today 
[02:26:30]  and say,  your mom's box.  It's only fitting.  That's going to be  a very,  very sad moment  on the show.  And there's only  one thing  we could do  for Eric Logan  at this point,  and he would  appreciate it,  cock pictures.  Yes.  Oh,  the listeners  can help out.  Yes.  Give him a fond  farewell.  Yes.  I guess,  by sending  cock pictures.  Yes.  Because he loves  the cock pictures.  Yeah.  We don't know  if he loves the cock,  but he loves  the cock pictures. 
[02:27:00]  All right,  blind CC Jimmy too.  But wait a minute,  I'm also,  all I get is  I'm gay,  cock pictures.  Can we get our  I Will Remember You  montage?  Oh,  wait a minute.  We need some  Logan clips though.  You misunderstood him,  by the way.  He's not working.  Huh?  He's not working for Harpo.  He's working for  Eric Nagel's new company.  It's Hippo.  Imagine he got  all confused. 
[02:27:30]  He's actually working  for $10,000 a year,  not a million dollars  a year,  and it's for  Hippo.  Hippo.  Hippo.  Ah,  fuck me.  This business  just always  gives you that twist  and that turn.  We had him for a long time.  I mean,  That's true.  Think about it.  You know?  Think about it.  Think about it.  I think we'll be okay  in the merger.  I don't think  they'll just dump us.  For what?  We're good boys.  A charmer like me?  I know.  Jimmy Norton alone  is just charming. 
[02:28:00]  Ricky M.  from Massachusetts  is very confused.  I thought Gale  was Oprah's  right-hand man.  Oh,  yeah.  Maybe too soon  for the Oprah jokes.  Let's make sure  Eric signs the contract.  Oprah doesn't bother us.  Yeah.  Does he have to  move to Chicago?  Chicago?  Oh,  I would imagine  he would have to  move to the Windy City.  He's not going to do that  from Washington.  Are you going to be  in Washington?  Washington.  At least we know  we could get  Oprah Winfrey tickets  now for our ladies. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Hey.  Can I just  for a second  address  What you doing, baby?  This girl  named Tina.  Hi, Tina.  She called a few times.  Mm-hmm.  She's been  on a pal talk  Mm-hmm.  insisting  that I mention  the fact that  Adrienne Barbeau  was on an episode  of Quincy.  We had moved on  from the Adrienne  Barbeau shit  hours ago  fucking hours  ago  and she was still  just kept going  Anthony,  Anthony,  pick up,  I'm on the phone, 
[02:29:00]  I'm on the phone  and I looked up  and I saw her name  was up there  but it was,  we were already  into like  ten other things deep  Yeah.  and she would not  stop with the  Adrienne Barbeau  Quincy thing.  Yeah.  Tina,  I know!  All right?  Get it!  After Swamp Thing,  you know,  we didn't give a shit  about Adrienne Barbeau  anymore.  So, uh,  Tina,  people on Pal Talk,  feel free to just  mock Tina  to no fucking end.  There.  Oh, they put her 
[02:29:30]  on the dumb bitch meter.  She's scoring high.  No, she won't be bounced.  I'd rather just have her  sit there  and be goofed on.  We get it, Tina.  You blow goats.  All right.  Well, there you go, Tina.  They found her  by the swamp, Sam!  There was swamp gook  in between her  giant mammaries.  The swamp thing  teabagged her.  Gypsy.  Hey, Gypsy.  Gypsy, everyone!  Gypsy!  Gypsy's out of steam already. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  That was all  Gypsy had.  Oh, that's all Gypsy has.  But that was good.  There was some swamp residue  between her huge breasts.  There was a beautiful body  and the hairdo  was a permanent.  A permanent!  Could it have been a girl  that you were maybe  on a boat with?  I don't know.  It was either  Adrian Barbeau  or Peter Brady  in the later episodes.  She had a pair  of big fat  fucking tits, Sam. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  Gypsy gets a little blue.  I want a tit fucker, Sam!  Even you  with your tiny Asian penis!  I want to straddle a tits  and fuck a face, Sam!  Take the toe tag off  and take the  take the money hand  comes in.  I don't remember  this episode.  That's right.  Gypsy loses  his fucking mind.  Give me those tongs! 
[02:31:00]  I want to open  her asshole, Sam!  and smell it!  I'm going to  fill her full of cum!  He just  loses it  and Quincy  just starts  fucking the body.  That's right.  She couldn't be  any worse  than that  flat-ass  cunt  way out of my boat, Sam!  Her ass  was lost  in a lawnmower accident!  She should be  murdered! 
[02:31:30]  Quincy  just loses  his fucking mind.  Open her mouth!  There's a moth in it!  I want to  fuck her throat, Sam!  Push my cheeks!  Tongue out my  hiney, Sam!  With your  jet black hairdo!  Laying on the  fucking  autopsy table  with the  Y fucking cut  in her chest  top of the head  sawn off  and Quincy's cock  balls deep in her.  And what was his  boss's name  with the mustache?  Oh yeah, fuck.  Can't remember.  He comes in  and gives him a scolding? 
[02:32:00]  Yes, of course.  So is yelling at him.  Hey, we tried to get  Logan on the phone  by the way.  That would be  something that  Steve, the executive  producer of the  Opie and Anthony  show should be  on top of.  Maybe he is.  Let's ask Steve.  Steve?  Steve!  No.  Steve?  Grab Steve.  Hello.  Are you getting  Logan on the phone?  Have you tried  getting Logan on the phone?  Yes.  Are you just saying  yes because now  you would look  bad if you say no?  No.  Actually, I have  a phone.  No.  What has he said?  What?  What has he said? 
[02:32:30]  I haven't picked up  yet.  He hasn't picked up  yet.  He hasn't picked up  the phone yet.  Okay.  We're not kidding.  We're not going to  get him.  Steve's now going to  try to get our  Logan on the phone.  Yes, Ilo.  I heard you're playing  the harpsichord.  Congratulations.  I heard you're  working for Helpo. 
[02:33:00]  The times,  they are a-changing.  Put a finger  in my hiney, Sam.  What?  I'm going to make  comsies.  What's that about,  Jim C?  You just got to  give him a prostate  exam every day.  She may have a  flat ass, but she  puts a finger in  my hiney, Sam.  My hiney.  There had to be  something good about  that flat ass bitch.  I want to fuck  my boss's face 
[02:33:30]  and feel the little  mustache tickle  my balls, Sam.  Well, Detective  Monaghan,  tongue's my ear.  I like my ear  kissed.  He's a piece of  shit.  Quincy just goes  completely ballistic.  He's awful.  Starts fucking  the corpses.  That's right.  Turn on the  wonder years.  I want to come, 
[02:34:00]  Sam.  Take off that  girl's onesie.  That's right.  Adrian Barbo died.  I put codeine in  her drink and she  died of a codeine  overdose.  Now eat my ass,  Abigail.  Abigail.  What was her last  name again?  I don't know.  Abigail.  I don't remember.  Whatever.  I need facts in the  middle of a great  bit. 
[02:34:30]  That's all right, I  asked for the boss's  name.  I'm an idiot.  Why don't we take a  quick break and continue  with the O.P. and  Anthony show?  That's you,  Iraq.  Jesus Christ.  Iraq?  Dillette stalled.  Iraq?  Iraq, it's not his  fault.  Dillette stalled,  restarted.  Now what do we do?  Hold on, here's the  official, we scooped  everybody, two employees  from Nate Davis, date  July 9th, 2008,  referring to Eric 
[02:35:00]  Logan.  He's dead.  That's right.  The company's been very  badly raped, you see?  These official  announcements are always  horseshit.  Don't try the wine.  These official  announcements are always  horseshit.  Are they?  It is with regret that I  inform you that Eric  Logan will step down as  XM's executive vice  president, programming as  of July 31st, 2008.  He has accepted an  extraordinary opportunity  to join Harpo, Inc., 
[02:35:30]  full details of which  will be announced  shortly.  Apparently a mailroom  position has opened.  And they thought young  Eric would be perfect  to run letters around  the building.  How great would it be if  Oprah offered him a  terrible job and he  misunderstood?  He didn't get it.  Oh, he's making 41  G's a year.  He has to pay his own  moving expenses.  I think Eric doesn't  need this shit anymore  is what it comes down  to.  That's a big job, man.  Working for Oprah,  she ain't going anywhere.  He had a lot of stress 
[02:36:00]  he had to deal with.  Can I say that I love  Eric, but how funny  would it be if her show  all of a sudden became  number 30?  Like, after he came out  Oh, boy.  Just tanks.  It just went right  into the shitter.  Steve, why write it  down when you can say it?  There's a million likes  in the studio.  What's up, Steve?  As soon as he can,  he will, but he cannot  get on the air right now.  Why?  We won't be hearing  from him.  I'll be hearing from him  no more.  Didn't give a reason,  he just said he cannot.  But he will.  But I was asking him.  But I was asking him,  yes.  There it is. 
[02:36:30]  That's exactly it.  I love it.  I love it, Steve.  Oh, no, don't be mad.  I'm going to go  blow my brains out.  I'm going to go  blow your brains out.  The beauty is...  Yes, I guess I better  find a sharpshooter.  Oh, shit.  Because not only  am I gay and incompetent,  but I'm stupid.  I saw that.  I missed.  The beauty is,  he says he's going  to blow his brains out  and not one of us  said,  no, don't! 
[02:37:00]  Shut up.  Eric has made  tremendous contributions  to XM since joining  the company  four years ago  when we had only  2.1 million subscribers  and 120 channels.  We now have  2.2 million  and 121 channels.  We're now on the  verge of bankruptcy.  Today's unrivaled  content starring  Opie and Anthony  as well as 169  other channels  is the direct result 
[02:37:30]  of Eric's vision,  hard work,  and inspired leadership  of our programming group.  Blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  Why can't these guys  just talk from the heart?  We're firing  this drunken fool.  Every word was  carefully picked  for this.  Yes.  Under Eric's  leadership,  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  what?  Under Eric's  leadership,  Opie and Anthony  I need food.  Under Eric's 
[02:38:00]  leadership,  XM expanded  and enhanced  our lineup  across the board  to include  some of the  biggest and  best names  in broadcasting  including  Opie and Anthony  and content  that appeals  to every kind  of fan  whether it's  sports,  music,  news,  or entertainment.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  In the coming weeks  I will announce  the organizational structure  that will be  in place  after Eric  leaves.  Until his  departure  at the end  of this month  he will continue  in his current  capacity  overseeing  day-to-day 
[02:38:30]  operations,  personal matters,  and merger-related  planning.  No, he won't.  Like they're going  to let him  be involved  in merger-related  planning.  Ha ha, come on.  No, he won't.  Starting right now  he just gets to  sit there  and just kind of  like do  check his email.  Merge your  fucking belongings  with this box.  Right.  And then merge  that into your car.  And merge  the hell out of here.  Then merge  into a wall  for all he can.  Right.  Right.  Exactly. 
[02:39:00]  That's the merger  fucking related  planning.  He had to leave.  It was a merger.  Say Quincy  gets business quickly.  Of course.  You know what  this means?  What?  Less radio for us  until the new guy  is announced.  Starting tomorrow.  Nice.  You're lucky  if we're even here  tomorrow.  We will miss Eric  and the infectious  energy and  infectious  and enthusiasm  that he brought  to XM every day.  Please join me  in thanking Eric 
[02:39:30]  for four years  of incredible service  by sending him  cockpictures  and wishing him  continued success  in his new endeavor.  His new what?  Endeavor.  His new what?  I don't know  how to say it though.  Endeavor.  Endeavor.  His new endeavor.  His new endeavor.  Eric Logan  left  to go to  a new endeavor.  Endeavor.  And we wish him  continued success  in his new endeavor.  Endeavor. 
[02:40:00]  us.  And it just says  Nate Davis.  Not truly,  sincerely.  I love us.  None of that.  Love.  Today's unrivaled  content lineup  of 170 channels  is a direct result  of Eric's  double vision.  That's right.  Everything got doubled  since he got here.  That's right.  Eric,  carefully  emboring  with the hand  covering one eye.  Eric was even  thinking of XM  during the bed spins  and with his head 
[02:40:30]  in the toilet.  How funny would it be  if the stock  just went through  the roof  because he was  the problem  all along.  That's it.  The Logan factor  is gone.  Right.  Buy,  buy,  buy,  buy,  buy,  buy.  He's going to be  day-to-day operations,  personal matters,  and merger-related  planning.  Yeah,  right.  You won't be  attending this meeting  today.  No.  He's been relegated  to what amounts  to the kiddie table  at Thanksgiving.  That's such bullshit.  He's not going to be  doing any of this stuff. 
[02:41:00]  If he was,  he'd be able to  sign us  to some huge contract  like you just said.  That's why we got  to get him on the phone.  Yeah,  come on,  Elo.  Do it up.  Oh,  my God.  Swanson,  New York.  Hey,  Swanson,  I want to go over there.  What?  Do that to my name  every time I come on the show.  What else are we going to do?  It's Swanson.  We could do a TV dinner  a bit.  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah,  there you go.  All right.  TV dinner.  I wanted to know  if we can still make fun  of Don Wiki Wicklund  and send cock pictures  to him.  You think Don Wicklund 
[02:41:30]  is moving up  because Eric Logan  is leaving?  You know what?  You know how this stuff works?  No.  Fired,  so fired,  every one of them.  New guy comes in  and picks his own people.  That's how it works  in radio.  But can we still  send cock pictures  to him?  Why would we want  to reward Don Wicklund  like that?  Yes,  we want Logan.  And give him things that,  see,  we would have to give him  things he doesn't like,  like hot chicks  and vaginas.  We want Eric Logan  to enjoy the goodness,  not Don Wicklund. 
[02:42:00]  Don Wicklund  is a faggot.  A little harsh.  Really?  Oh,  he knows I'm teasing.  Don talk all the time  while he's sucking  my cock.  I talk all the time  while he's kneeling  and nodding affirmatively.  Let's get Don  on the phone.  I think Don's gay.  I think Don needs  to say a few words  about his boss,  Eric Logan.  Get Don on the phone.  A few nice things.  A few nice things.  We should have people 
[02:42:30]  come in and maybe  or get him on the phone  and say things about  Eric Logan.  Hilo gave a clue  yesterday on the phone  and we missed it.  What did he say?  Joe Dallas,  what?  Hey,  yesterday you guys  were talking to him  on the phone  and someone said,  what in the hell  are you typing?  And he actually said,  I hereby.  Oh,  he said,  I hereby.  Yeah,  but that's kind of  what,  that'd be something  he said.  That was his little tape. 
[02:43:00]  And us self-centered asses  who are always just trying  to think of the next  fucking line,  he probably said,  I'm leaving.  Yeah.  I'm going to work  for Harpo.  Yeah.  And we didn't hear it.  All right.  Well,  God,  all the guys  with the vision  are leaving the company.  Lee Abrams was an amazing guy  and he's,  he's long gone.  He went to Chicago too.  Is he?  I thought he was still  with the company.  Oh my God.  Are you kidding?  No idea.  It's been gone  for four months.  It's easy.  I was like,  thank Christ,  he stopped sending me  that boring fucking newsletter.  Oh,  I love the newsletter. 
[02:43:30]  Please.  I love the newsletter.  Footer.  Yo,  what's up boys?  What up footer?  And,  what the fuck's up?  Jimmy?  I mean me.  Jimmy.  Yo,  I wanted to bring up something  to Jimmy.  Hey,  I've,  I've went into the,  to the cuckold world  a little bit  and it's been absolutely  incredible,  dude.  Tell me.  Um,  sorry.  So we got,  right now it's three times  so far.  All right,  hold on a minute  because there are a bunch  of people out there  that don't know 
[02:44:00]  what cuck holding  is all about.  Jimmy will explain.  Well,  it can be a different thing.  Are you a married man?  No.  Mr. Grady?  I'm actually banging  the wives.  Oh,  he bangs the wives  of husbands  who want to watch  and be humiliated.  Yeah,  now.  How do you meet them?  How do you meet them?  Um,  there's a little list  out there  from a guy named Craig.  Okay.  I don't get it.  What?  Where do you find them?  Oh,  I go in the newspaper.  I go in the newspaper.  So,  so you,  what do you advertise  yourself as?  A bull? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah,  just,  um,  you know.  No,  no,  no,  no.  I don't use the word  bull,  but,  um,  just,  you know,  long lasting,  well endowed  and,  you know,  I'm pretty legit,  so it,  uh,  I don't usually disappoint.  I got a pick  if I had to,  you know,  but,  um.  And what happens?  They contact you.  Yep,  they contact me  and they'll send a pick  or,  you know,  want me to send a little proof.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And,  I,  um,  for me,  I don't really want the dude  to be,  you know,  in any way involved.  You know what I mean?  I'd rather not even like DP, 
[02:45:00]  you know what I mean?  That double penetration,  I don't even want to do that.  Um,  but,  so,  so anyway,  I,  so far I've had three different experiences.  The first time,  I want to say she was a five,  not terrible,  and I was a little nervous first time,  but it was good.  Second time,  same thing,  a five,  great time.  The third time,  holy shit,  dude.  I mean,  I,  if,  I would never let people bang my wife.  She was so,  this chick is so hot,  Jimmy.  I mean,  you know,  she's like an eight or a nine.  Dude is the man,  just sits back,  lets you do his thing,  talks you through it with her, 
[02:45:30]  you know,  tells her what to do,  just a dirty girl.  Fucking incredible,  dude.  Absolutely incredible.  Are the guys tied up at all,  or was there any humiliation,  or just watching them,  watching you fuck?  Two things.  One,  the,  the,  the one,  the second time I went,  the guy,  he wanted to just kind of sit in the corner,  and like,  almost like direct his chick.  You know what I mean?  Like,  all right,  yeah,  we blow his load,  take it in the face,  you know,  like,  things like that.  Okay?  The other guy,  strictly,  fully clothed,  I mean,  I glanced up a little bit to kind of see where he was at.  He's like,  fiddling around on the computer. 
[02:46:00]  I mean,  it was just like,  he didn't even give a fuck.  Wow.  You know?  He wasn't even involved in it,  but.  Do we wait?  Oh,  go ahead,  sorry.  I don't want to interrupt,  sorry.  No,  I guess what I was just going to jump in here for a second.  The only way I would like have sex with someone else's wife,  if the guy like was in a straight jacket or something,  how do you know the guy's not going to jump up with a hatchet or something?  Like,  all of a sudden,  all of a sudden decide, 
[02:46:30]  I thought this was a good idea,  but now that I'm living through this,  this isn't a good idea,  and I'm really not,  really not happy,  and I need to kill you now.  No,  you make a good point,  because I definitely was nervous,  and I mean,  dude,  when you hear Jimmy talk about it and different things,  I'm like,  holy shit,  this is great,  I'm going to bang with no bang,  like,  you know,  you just make it look easy,  Jimmy,  you know what I mean?  It's like,  it's just good times,  you know,  but honestly,  you are walking into,  you know,  a couple's,  you know,  strangers home,  you have no idea who they are,  and not for nothing,  you're getting fucking naked, 
[02:47:00]  so you're sitting around in their room,  you obviously may have a few drinks,  but my point is,  you try to get as comfortable with the dude as possible,  as far as like,  like,  I talk to him like it's my boy,  like,  yo,  but man,  meanwhile,  like two minutes later,  I'm about to bang your wife,  but I try to get as comfortable as,  you know,  possible and feeling out,  and just see what happens,  you know?  Yeah,  I like,  a good cucking is,  cucking.  Is that what they call it?  No,  I'm just kidding.  I just wanted to share that with you guys,  so I'm out of here.  Thank you,  sir.  I'll talk to you later.  Good job. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Good job by you.  That is,  I didn't even know what that was called  until Jimmy started talking about it.  I've enjoyed some of the videos,  because the girls being so dirty,  I was never into interracial porn,  just because it couldn't be my penis in it,  so it didn't really turn me off.  Is Eric on hold?  No.  Okay.  Someone that could wait,  trust me.  Oh.  Don Wicklin.  Oh,  let's go get him,  Don.  Right.  All right,  and then we'll get back to you.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen,  it's Don,  I don't butt my shirt all the way up, 
[02:48:00]  Wicklin.  Hi,  Wicky.  Donnie.  Obi.  Hi,  Don.  Your boss is leaving.  How do you feel today?  I just found out.  Yeah,  that's great.  Get rid of the cancer.  Wow.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  Got to give it to Don.  Got to give it to him.  So,  are you bummed out,  Don?  Nah.  Nah.  Hold on a second.  I got to finish picking up the trash.  Hold on a second.  All right,  because I always say Don works with a stick with a nail at the end, 
[02:48:30]  and picks up the garbage around.  That's right.  XM.  Hey,  Wicky,  are you worried with the merger and stuff?  You know what?  It's a day-to-day thing,  Jimmy.  You never know.  No,  Don.  Nobody knows what's going to happen with anybody.  But are you,  I'm saying,  are you a little worried,  or do you feel secure?  I mean,  not that anyone's told you anything,  because they won't,  they won't,  you know,  play their cards,  but Don,  you know,  you know I like you,  right?  Yes.  I mean,  we do our thing on the radio,  because,  you know,  that's what we do,  but the reality is, 
[02:49:00]  I do like you,  and with that,  I say this,  you are so fired.  You are not going to be part of this new company,  so start getting out there,  because you still got,  like,  you got some stock here,  my friend.  I don't know,  Oak,  Wicklin is one of those guys where,  they have to keep XM people,  they have to keep some.  Do they really?  Yeah,  yeah,  they will,  they're not going to gut everybody,  they can't just gut the whole,  every single person,  and Wickie,  Wickie knows his way around,  but he's not in a high enough position like Eric Logan, 
[02:49:30]  where he'll be dealing on a day-to-day basis with Mel,  because that's probably where Mel wants his people,  to oversee everything,  but the day-to-day stuff,  he'll need guys like Don,  who know their way around XM.  You know,  I wasn't even making a joke,  they got Tim Sabian over there.  Tim's great,  but would Tim and Don be competing with each other?  Maybe they can both do it,  and be like the Tim and Don show.  Don,  I mean,  everyone's leaving XM,  right?  A lot of people,  I heard we wouldn't even recognize half the people down there at this point. 
[02:50:00]  I don't even recognize half the people when I work here.  Don,  it's so weird though,  it was supposed to be like a merger,  but isn't it more like just like a takeover?  It's so a takeover.  It's so a takeover.  What I mean?  How did that happen?  Like,  is that just the way it was?  That's so weird because XM was in better shape financially.  You know,  guys,  I ask the same questions every single freaking day.  I really do.  I ask the same questions,  but I ask Eric the same questions. 
[02:50:30]  Then again,  I can't ask him now because his ass is gone.  He might be on the answer now.  But he's going to be continuing day-to-day operations until he leaves.  Right.  Including a merger-related planning.  Yeah.  Right.  Good luck with that.  He'll probably be like merger-related planning.  He'll probably like where the truck should back up and take things.  Where's that hand truck?  Where's that forklift?  Yeah.  That's kind of planning, though.  Are they going to announce a successor or what? 
[02:51:00]  I haven't heard anything yet.  Probably not, right?  I would tell you, too, but nothing yet.  No.  Because now they're saying the merger is going to be done by the end of the month.  Why would they put a new guy in there before the merger when the guy would just, you know, get fired?  They're going to push it off, push it off, and I guarantee you it's not going to be somebody from here.  That's a high position in the company.  And in the merged company, it's a high position.  So it's going to be somebody from over there.  Well, at least we got a good relationship with Mel, so that's good. 
[02:51:30]  That's what we got on our side.  We haven't talked to him in a while, so I'm sure it's fine.  We haven't talked to him in six years, Jimmy.  Maybe he'll forget who we were.  Maybe he'll forget who we were and think that we were, like, just people that we worked with him before and we were good.  Hey, Don, you know all that promotional stuff that says Opie and Anthony?  Could you quickly, like, just white it out and just change our names?  Maybe that'll work.  Yeah.  Slappy and Wappy.  The Greg and Tony show.  Yeah, just turn everything into Greg and Tony and maybe we can get it past them. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm sure he'll be happy to have this program.  We don't have any swag left anyway.  We don't have any budget, so.  No, there's nothing left.  Help.  At the times, they are.  Go back to red alert, people.  We're back on red alert.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  We lowered the alert a little bit, but we're back in full red at this point.  Full red.  So, Don, what's your thoughts on Eric Logan leaving?  Click.  No, no, no.  Talk from the heart, man.  Come on, man. 
[02:52:30]  It's going to be a huge loss.  A huge loss.  It really will be.  In what way?  A huge loss for XM.  Heard it here, folks.  What are you, Earl?  Earl says shit like that.  Talk from the heart.  Eric did a lot for XM.  He did tons for us, and it's going to be a huge loss for us.  It really is.  More black girl crap.  Maybe that is from the heart, though.  Maybe Wicklin doesn't really like Elo.  It's true.  Or maybe he doesn't really know what Eric Logan did.  Or maybe.  No, really.  Who does?  Eric and I were very close, and it's a huge loss for us not having him here. 
[02:53:00]  It really is.  God's still holding on.  He's worried about his own gig.  I mean, he's got to be worried.  You know, now that Logan's leaving the company, I always wanted to know this.  Did you and him ever have gay relations?  Not once.  Close.  How many times, then?  Did it ever get close?  Because I always saw a little weirdness between you two when we went out for those steak dinners.  Yeah, that was all an act.  I'll tell you what happened.  Eric misread Don and thought he could have him whenever he wanted, and then got drunk  one time and tried to kiss Don, like, in the American Beauty, and Wicklin pushed him 
[02:53:30]  off.  He goes, what are you doing?  I have very blue eyes, but I'm not gay.  And Eric said, I'm sorry, dude.  I'm sorry.  Keep that between us.  He has green eyes.  What's that?  He has green eyes.  No, you have blue eyes, I think.  Hey.  No.  Don't you, Don?  Is all hell, now that the official, what do you call this, letter came out from Nate  Davis, is all hell breaking loose down there?  You know what?  Nobody is to be found on the programming level down on the first floor here, so you can't 
[02:54:00]  talk to anybody.  Nobody's responding to anything.  I know you guys wanted to get Eric on the air.  I tried to find him.  I have a feeling he's probably packing up his shit already.  Yeah.  Yeah, because this is crap.  He's not going to be in that building starting tomorrow.  That's just how this works.  If anyone knows about packing shit, it's Don Wicklund.  That's a gay joke.  Why would you say that and it would flick you answer me? 
[02:54:30]  That's hurtful.  I'm kidding.  Don knows I'm kidding.  Hey, Don, did we scoop everyone?  Oh, no, absolutely.  Nice.  I was in my meeting, my nine o'clock meeting, and Steve let me know that you guys were talking  about it, and no one in operations knew about it, so yeah, you scooped everything.  Nice.  So let's talk about cuckolding.  Have you ever had any cuckolding experiences?  Cuckolding.  Yeah.  Have you ever been the bull?  Like when they call you, they call in Wiki to get the job done?  The bull. 
[02:55:00]  No.  Usually the bull is a black guy, I think, though.  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Like servicing her bull.  Wow.  Her husband watches.  Don?  What happens after the cuckolding?  I don't know.  And then the bull leaves, and then you're just like, oh, honey, that was good.  A lot of times, I think the guy will probably want a cream pie.  Maybe the girl will fucking make him lick out her pussy.  Cream pie.  That's what they call it, eat a cream pie, where the guy will suck out his body's pussy.  There's nothing creamy about it. 
[02:55:30]  The bull will come inside the woman, and a lot of times, she'll put her pussy on the  guy's face and make him clean it.  Wow.  That is degrading.  And then squeeze the cum into his mouth.  Jesus.  Yeah.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I forgot.  What do you mean me?  I'm not saying that it is what it is.  Even to know that is sick.  What's that sick about it?  Have some cream pie, you goose.  I could see Steve talking about it, but Jimmy has an embarrassment.  I could see Steve ordering one.  Yes. 
[02:56:00]  I'd like a cream pie, please.  Yes.  It's a pie with cream.  Yes.  Yes, I get it.  I'm gay.  I like creamy pies.  Pies.  Could you go find Eric Logan for us right now?  I am.  Actually, I gotta go, because I gotta go pack up all his stocks and money that he's got  to put in my car now.  Yeah.  Oh, is he leaving with some big options?  All right.  All of Eric's stuff that he's done over the past four years is going to be in the dumpster  behind XM.  What do you mean?  It was in the dumpster five minutes after he did it. 
[02:56:30]  Do you know how many of his memos people just looked at politely with their misspellings  and fucking coffee spills on them?  I got it.  I got it.  That's right.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Booze-fueled emails.  Yes.  We will change the name of the company to fucking XM.  People see the fucking and think it's crazy.  All right.  Relax.  All right.  Relax.  All right.  Yes.  I have it.  I have it.  We could relax them inside of tube televisions.  No.  They're going out.  We could relax them hats where they play music from the hats. 
[02:57:00]  That's not what you're talking about.  No.  We're a fool.  Well, good luck, Kilo.  We're going to miss Eric very much.  As a guy, I'm going to miss him.  I'm not happy whatsoever.  Don.  Not just as a boss.  Don.  Boyd.  Don.  Boyd.  Say something nice about Eric Logan.  I love Eric.  I wish him the best of luck at Harpo, and hopefully he's hiring.  Ah, okay.  There you go. 
[02:57:30]  You don't think I thought that right away?  I'm like, there's no position for us in Harpo.  No.  What are you, stupid?  Hey.  No, no, no.  Let me tell you something.  Maybe they'll start a shock shock division.  I have covered your asses for four years.  Fuck that.  You're on your own, dude.  Go fuck yourself.  What are you mad at Wiki for?  We just told him he tastes loads.  Whatever.  He's a good boy.  Covered our asses.  He's had his cover many times with men's pelvises. 
[02:58:00]  How delusional is he?  I had the hotline right to Eric Logan.  You never...  Fuck you.  Covered our asses.  I don't want the people to believe that.  Dick.  Jesus.  It's Don.  Oh, this whole place is falling apart.  Yeah.  All right.  Now we go into a merged company without Eric Logan.  That will be interesting.  I think we knew that was going to happen. 
[02:58:30]  Of course we did.  And wait for the call today, Anthony.  As you sit there casually.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Did you guys hear?  And it's always like...  Because stupid Bob, our agent, he's on L.A. time.  So he's still sleeping like he's dreaming about fucking whatever he dreams about.  Ghoul as shit.  And he'll finally call around, too.  Did you guys hear?  Yeah.  We heard hours ago, Bob.  Hi.  Hi.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Bob?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Did you hear the news? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Eric Logan is going over to Harpo.  I can't even say it.  This is disaster for us.  Just go back.  Go to Sears.  Buy some tin snips and tin knocking hammer because you're going to be just back in the  attics.  This is the end for us.  No, it's the end for him.  It's about him.  Oh, my God.  I see my 10% going away.  10% of...  Oh, my God.  My kids were in that water, too, Chief. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, whenever Bob talks, he sounds like he's about to cum.  Just doom and gloom.  Cumsies.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Oh, this is so bad for us.  Oh, this is so...  That's what it's going to be.  Over and over again.  Just this fucking chant of how bad this is for us.  This is not good.  This is...  Oh, my God.  He was our guy.  What do I do now?  He was our...  You know us?  He was our guy there.  Now we have no one.  When the merger goes through, we're going to have to deal with people that, you know, 
[03:00:00]  we don't have good relationships with.  I don't know.  It's going to be a very difficult situation for us if we even make it through at all.  I said, oh, my God.  How did this happen?  How did this happen?  You're okay at CBS?  Are you sure?  Are you sure?  Because I'm hearing things over there, too.  Rumblings and grumblings.  I don't know.  I just...  Oh, my God.  It's a tale of 10% of nothing.  What is that?  It's nothing, isn't it?  Yes.  Nothing.  Something.  Nothing. 
[03:00:30]  Least nothing.  You've got to have something to get a commission to me.  Yes.  Okay, hold on.  I'm at the store.  Yes, one piece of Bazooka Joe bubblegum, please.  Can I have a receipt?  Yes, thank you.  I'm curious.  Well, hold on.  It's going to be a...  I say we call Bob now.  It's going to be a fun ride.  Yeah, let's call Bob.  Let's call him on the air now and talk to him.  Yeah.  Super Agent Bob Eatman?  I bet you.  Can I take a guess?  He won't be as panicked as you think because he knew it was coming. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, yeah, okay.  He knew it was coming.  All right, sure.  Well, I mean, that's not good for us, but...  I knew it was coming.  No, you have no idea.  This guy doesn't take news well, ever.  Yeah.  He knew it was coming.  Yeah, I mean, it's not a shock.  God, I hope we break the news to him.  This will be...  Oh, someone already had a call, I'm sure.  He'll probably do.  Wait, what do I do?  Up this part, right?  Yeah, okay.  What time is it there?  10, 9, 8, 7 in the morning? 
[03:01:30]  You hear like, oh, Bob, in the background.  Our call has been forwarded to an automatic...  Yeah, fuck that.  We call his house and wait for everybody else.  8, man.  Fuck this guy.  8, man.  Call him.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, I hope his 10 of a wife answers.  She is lovely.  She's a 10, and he's 3 on a good day. 
[03:02:00]  Bob's a minus 4.  All right, here we go.  Uh-oh.  They probably think it's a death.  It's always bad when you're falling off.  Oh, hello.  Robin?  Yeah, hi, Russ.  Hi.  Oh, boy.  It's Opie.  Oh, hi, Opie.  How old are you?  Who's Russ?  Bob's brother.  You sounded just like him.  Oh, okay.  Is Bob there?  We have bad news.  Oh, God, yeah.  Hold on. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  Opie.  Yes.  Hold on, Opie.  All right.  We're waking him up.  Hey, how are you?  Wow, he was right there.  Eric Logan's leaving the company.  Pardon me?  Eric Logan is leaving the company.  Bob, you got time.  I heard you know where he's going.  Harpo.  You're on the air, by the way.  Yep, I know.  I heard.  There it is.  There it is.  Yeah, he's going to Harpo.  What do you think about that?  You're not surprised, are you, that he's leaving?  Is Eric there?  No, no, he's not. 
[03:03:00]  No, he's already blown us off.  He said, good luck to us.  Are you on the air?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bye, guys.  What do you think this means, Bob?  I think it's great for him.  That's what everyone says.  We know it's great for him.  We're not stupid.  What do you think about for the company and us and the continuing relationship thereof?  Yeah.  Well, I'm hopeful it'll be good for you guys.  I mean, I was good with Eric there, and I, you know, we'll see. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know what to tell you.  You hear that?  Oh, God.  I don't know what to tell you.  It starts thinking.  Oh, my God.  You don't know what to tell us.  That's not good.  No, I don't know what to tell you because I don't, you know, in a merge company, it'll  be, I assume it'll be.  You assume what?  I assume in a merge company, I think it'll be Scott Greenstein.  Uh-huh.  In a non-merge company.  I have no idea who's, uh... 
[03:04:00]  Does Scott like us?  So, what do you think about dealing with Scott?  Would that be a thing to do?  Yeah.  Does he like us?  I don't know.  I haven't talked to him.  I hope he does.  That's a nice...  Well, I do.  You bring in a lot of, uh, a lot of subscribers.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And?  Ah.  You're getting into what I mean, yeah.  And I just woke up.  When did you hear about Eric Logan leaving?  Oh, I just heard, uh, uh, yesterday. 
[03:04:30]  Heard the...  Oh, thanks for the phone call.  Yeah.  That's a weird thing not to...  It was top secret, guys.  It was, uh, you know, something that I'd heard, and, and, uh, I didn't hear that he  actually, you know, I had heard that he had actually signed his agreement or was, you  know, actually done with that, but I heard that, uh, it was a very good possibility that  he was going to take the job.  And you wouldn't trust us with that information?  Yes, I would trust you with that information.  I would trust you.  I'd trust you to go on the air with it. 
[03:05:00]  Like everything else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Bob.  Uh, so, I, I hope, uh...  Are you getting nervous, Bob?  Things are changing.  Yeah, what's your gut, what's your gut feeling about this?  Uh, feeling about the merger?  About Eric not being there, about, uh, the merger, about who we're going to have to deal  with.  Just your gut feeling about the future of this program and, uh, satellite radio.  Are you nervous? 
[03:05:30]  Uh, I'm not nervous.  No, you're still the highest, you know, bringing the highest, most subscribers on, on the platform  on XM.  So, I'm not nervous about it, no.  Hopefully optimistic.  Yeah, I told you, man.  We're going to be fine.  I mean, I, Bob, it's so hard being the Pete positive in this situation.  Hopefully optimistic.  I couldn't hear you, Jimmy.  I, I was just saying.  Now you've got to repeat it.  First of all, here's the beauty of this, Bob.  Bob, the joke bombed, and now I have to say it again. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  I said.  See, you're talking into the mic thinking you're talking to Bob.  You've got to yell to that phone.  Oh, he's on the phone?  Yes.  Oh, but you called him on the phone, phone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't we have people here calling him?  I didn't feel like doing it.  That would be silly.  This is more real.  Hey, Bob.  We didn't wake you, did we?  There we go.  The kid redeems.  I, I know.  We're going to wake you every day now for not giving us that news yesterday.  That's right.  That's what we do now.  What do you think of them apples?  Yeah.  What do you think of them apples, Jimmy?  Or those apples. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  Bob, it's safe to say you're a bit nervous, huh?  No, I'm not nervous.  Loved having Eric, because he was a big supporter.  Where's our, where are we at with our option?  Option?  The option to pick up the option?  Yeah.  The date has passed.  Yeah.  See?  For all the people that were wondering.  No one's picked up the option, but it's a, it's still an option.  Hopefully it's going to be a merged company.  This is Dan's impression. 
[03:07:00]  The option, to pick up the option has passed.  And that's an option.  That's just an option, guys.  So, uh...  Yep.  But we have other options, besides the option.  Right.  There's always CVS.  So, who's...  So, when...  He didn't say CVS.  He said CVS.  We can work at the counters.  When are we going to talk to someone about the option, do you think?  You don't think Bob's talked about that already with somebody?  He tried, but no one's talking.  They're not doing anything until the company merges. 
[03:07:30]  I know.  That's why I'm asking his opinion on that.  Right, exactly.  He's been here.  He's been down this road.  He's not spending any money until they...  There's a, you know, a decision on the merger.  Oh, God, Bob.  What does that mean for us?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God, Bob.  I just put a pool in, for God's sake.  Okay.  I need to...  Yeah, talk to you about other things.  I need to...  I need to...  I need to review stuff like that.  I agree, Bob.  What do you think about drugs?  What do you think about selling drugs, Bob? 
[03:08:00]  I don't think it's a good idea.  Okay.  No.  I'll take your advice.  Think about it.  Hey, Bob, how do you feel about me mewling Flintstones chewables in my asshole?  Again.  Hey, Bob.  Do you have to get up now, or can you go back in your call?  You're coughing for a few more hours.  No, I got to get up.  Aw.  It's going to be a long day, isn't it, Bob, now that it's been announced?  Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.  Who are we going to be?  Big supporter of yours. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  I've been saying that.  Who are we going to report to now, you think, in the time being?  At XM?  Exactly.  I don't know if it's left.  Bob, we're so depressed by this news, we're going home early.  I don't think anyone would fault us for that, right?  Probably not.  Dandy Don Wicklin, maybe?  I'm reporting to Dan.  I mean...  No, of course not.  His name's Don.  Yeah, his name's Don.  Dan Wicklin. 
[03:09:00]  His husband.  I don't know who you're going to report to.  You know, you didn't really report to Eric lately.  I mean, he's, you know...  Well, he blew us off...  Yeah, he blew us off a while ago.  So I knew something was up.  I just think he's been busy with all the decisions that they had to make,  and I don't think it's really been there.  I think that...  Busy looking up real estate in Chicago.  Thank God I still have my Citadel stock.  Woo!  He's moving to Chicago.  Great city. 
[03:09:30]  Good for him.  Great job.  That helped the show today, Bob,  by making sure everyone knows that Chicago's a great city.  It is.  Nice.  It's going to work at Harpo.  Hey there.  Hey, your name's Eric Logan?  Hey, it's Elo.  Why don't you move from over there to over here?  Oh, Chicago.  A bunch of wind and mustachioed idiots.  He's going to have to deal with that.  He's going to have to become like a Cubs fan.  By the way, Bob... 
[03:10:00]  The biggest cologne is beer farts.  By the way, Bob,  you might want to make sure nothing's going on with Robin and your brother,  because she was very excited that I was Ross when she first answered the phone.  Ross.  Ross.  Ross.  Ross.  Ross.  Ross.  Sorry.  She goes, oh, Ross.  Right.  Oh, like at 7 in the morning.  I'll check into that.  You're not supposed to call until Bob leaves.  Right.  Ross, why are you calling now?  She was very suspicious.  She's like, oh, I'll get Bob, who hasn't left for work yet. 
[03:10:30]  Bob, my husband is still home.  Sure, I'll get him.  Uh-oh.  If I was not really laughing, I think there might be some suspicions.  Are you a cuckold, Bob?  That's the last thing I'm worried about.  I mean, I'm not really concerned about that.  What's the first thing?  The Opie and Anthony show, right?  That's my first priority, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Well, thanks for calling.  Ah, there it goes.  Go on, Ron.  Are they telling you that we have to go? 
[03:11:00]  Wait, who did you say goodbye to?  Say goodbye to all you guys.  Oh.  Did you say goodbye, Ron?  No.  Gotta go.  He's gotta go.  Gotta run, he said.  Oh, you gotta run.  He's got to run.  Go to the gym.  Oh, there you go.  What do you do at the gym?  He's got a trainer.  Jesus, that isn't nice to say to somebody.  What do you do at the gym?  You obviously don't use the equipment.  No, I don't mean that.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Bob probably puts on, like, little tight pants and does, like, Pilates and things that  show off his genital girth.  Why don't you say that? 
[03:11:30]  Bob's a creep.  I've seen Bob lift.  He could kick your ass.  So what?  Good for him.  He's a big girthy hog.  He's got a trainer named Jason, who's a fine trainer out there in L.A.  How was his Bob lift?  Yeah, you were here for a long time, you know.  Jason was my trainer for a while.  Right.  Right.  So.  All right.  All right, Bob.  Well, we won't keep you any longer.  Could Robin do the show with us a little longer?  No, she's in the shower.  She'd be great.  Oh, she's in the shower, huh? 
[03:12:00]  You got pal talk?  So, Bob.  Why isn't Bob laughing at him?  I don't know.  He goes to the gym this early?  Yeah.  Oof.  Before he goes to work.  Oh, it's really hard to hear anyone else other than you.  How long does he go to the gym for?  He goes every day for, like, an hour.  Oh, my God.  Or almost every day.  Yeah.  Three days a week.  Three days?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Bobby.  All right, Bobby.  All right, guys.  This is a bad day for us. 
[03:12:30]  You know that.  Nah, that's it.  I have faith Bob will start reinforcing some new relationships.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll call Don and make sure you guys are well taken care of.  You're going to call who?  Don.  Stop it with Don crap.  Don does nothing.  Don Wicklin?  I'm teasing.  He's the joke of the company.  Even Bob's teasing.  We're on our own.  We're on our own again.  That's wonderful.  That worked out well for us last time. 
[03:13:00]  When we had no boss.  A butterless ship.  Right.  That always works well when there's no direction.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Bob.  Have fun at the gym.  Don't pull anything.  Yeah.  Talk to you later.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bob's going to lose a nut today.  He's going to lose so much to try to get the stress out.  And a nut's going to fall out of his gym shorts.  We had a couple of good Bob-isms in there, though.  He's like, well.  Everyone was saying that.  They didn't realize how well you did, Bob, until they heard Bob. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, God.  What's the tink-a-link-a-link for?  Oh, someone's calling.  Someone's calling the Opster's phone.  Oh, no.  Who is that?  It's a Tate.  It's a Tate.  A Tate?  I was going to say it's a text.  Oh, God.  From Nate.  Just says, pack your crap, Hacks.  Hacks.  It's a Tate.  Yeah, Orbicast says that the FCC told XM lawyers to not schedule vacations for mid through late July. 
[03:14:00]  What?  Mm-hmm.  Why?  Mm-hmm.  Pucks, they'll be meeting.  Oh.  Why else wouldn't they?  Because they want Logan in on it.  Or maybe they just want the hotels that the lawyers would be taking in their fancy places.  Going spiraling.  Boo.  Not even a boo.  How great was Bob, though?  And the fucker knew yesterday.  I know.  How smart is Bob?  He didn't know who had to tell. 
[03:14:30]  Why would he?  Who cares if the info is leaked out a day early?  I don't want my salary to leak out.  Your salary couldn't drip out.  You're hurting his voice, though.  Oh, yeah.  I already know.  Yeah, yeah.  I found out.  I found out late last night.  Yeah.  I was walking in the night by police officers at the door.  Right?  He's just...  Oh, that's a great idea.  What?  Cole Bob's house at 30. 
[03:15:00]  That's not a good sign.  Joe is brilliant.  Hold on.  Let's give Joe the credit.  Joe and Jersey, what do you want us to do?  Yo, you guys got to call back like half an hour and say you're Russ again and ask if  Bob is gone and see if she really is fucking banging him.  You got to do it.  It sounded too convincing.  Like she sounded too surprised.  No, Robin, I got to say, she's hot as hell. 
[03:15:30]  There you go.  So why wouldn't?  Keep it in the family.  You know, they're out in L.A. or wherever.  It's a little different, you know?  Well, she'll give us good radio, though.  Bob's going to the gym in a few minutes, and then we'll call Bob's house back.  Thank you.  You got it.  Nothing better than having dinner with Bob and Evil Bob.  Bob and his brother Ross.  Evil Bob.  The excitement ensues.  Well, the Evil Bob because he does the goatee.  Yeah.  Like old school, like, you know, sitcoms. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Well, I gots the tinkle.  That's, uh, yeah.  That's about that.  You guys picked a good day to come here, I guess.  Yeah.  A lot of fun happening today.  What?  Yeah.  We like the applause.  Yeah.  We deserve it.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful  bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow Stickers have many other uses?  I use Wow Stickers around the house to keep raccoons away from my garbage. 
[03:16:30]  Come here, little fella.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's biting my balls.  Jesus Christ, my balls.  Ouch.  Ouch.  My balls.  My balls are being bit by a raccoon here, people.  Dude.  Raccoon eating my balls here.  Raccoon on balls.  Anybody?  Do you see the raccoon dangling from my crotch?  Opie and Anthony.  Get your official Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers at opieandanthony.com.  Derek, there's something hanging off your balls, man. 
[03:17:00]  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Opie and Anthony.  Nice audience outside today, too.  Yes.  Elo's resignation brought to you by 5-Hour Energy, by the way.  So the people are enjoying their 5-Hour Energy.  That's right.  Elo's resignation brought to you by 4-Year Incompetence.  5-Hour Energy.  Thank you. 
[03:17:30]  They give the listeners the free 5-Hour Energy.  I'm starting to see that 5-Hour Energy everywhere.  Yeah?  Yeah.  At our little supermarket there, Jimmy.  It's right on the counter.  Right there for your choosing.  A lot of people getting their 5 hours worth of energy without the crash, Anthony.  On the street, yeah.  Anyone jittery out there?  I don't know.  The answer is no.  Of course not.  No, because see, they don't give you the jitteriness.  Yeah.  You dopes.  Make you scream or something. 
[03:18:00]  Butcher came up with a little remix.  Remember when Shaq did that thing about Kobe?  Oh, yeah.  About his ass?  How does my ass taste?  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  That's why I didn't want to say that.  Because now you're going to isolate that and you're going to be, you know, sounding gay.  Why would you do that to yourself?  It could be anybody's.  Because I'm getting mine.  He ate his ass.  It's not like he said, hey, give me a cock to suck.  Right.  Or another example.  I don't know. 
[03:18:30]  I don't know.  I ate your ass.  Tasted good.  I don't mind a little shit.  Fuck it.  That could be anything.  Yeah, because if you sit here and say something like, I love getting balls in my face, they're  going to isolate it.  Okay.  So that's why I would never say anything like that.  I like a good man-ass right in my face.  No, you can't say things like that on the air.  That would be bad. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  So what if I'm hungry?  I had a cock.  Yeah, see?  It's another perfect example of what not to say because the wacky production guys will  throw something together and make you sound silly because all this part will be cut out  and they'll just isolate saying something like, you know, I like a cock you got to grab  with two hands.  Yeah.  You know?  Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer it unclipped.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Well, but...  Any examples?  Uh, no.  Uh, but...  No?  No? 
[03:19:30]  Butch, uh, did a remix of Shaq's tune to Kobe.  Yeah, boy, the streets is talking.  The NBA's dopest rhyme spitter and NY's illest DJ have teamed up to bring you the  Tell Me How My Ass Tastes Mixtape.  Hosted by DJ Fartbox.  Shaq's easy to look back, boy, and he's kicking it raw with hits from his classics like  What's Up, Doc?  Can we rock?  What's up, Doc?  Can we rock?  What's up, Doc?  All the way up to his new joint. 
[03:20:00]  Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes.  Shaq, who is back?  Coming straight for your fucking dome.  Pips, pushers, prostitutes, even white boys.  You ain't popping in the hood till you got to...  Tell me how my ass tastes mixing.  Cop that shit now.  Damn.  Damn.  Nice job, Butch.  Damn.  Butch knows how to...  What is it?  What's the word?  Uh...  Knows how to...  Bring it.  Bring it on? 
[03:20:30]  Rhyme?  What?  Bust out some rhymes for the people that thought we were kidding.  No, we weren't.  Line of the day is sponsored by...  Fucking A.  Fucking A.  I'm right with you.  We're not stupid.  And before you bitch, you would do the same thing.  If you knew your boss was gone and you had no boss for a few weeks, you're taking longer  lunches.  You're showing up at 9.15 instead of 9.  And you're going home at 4.  So shut up. 
[03:21:00]  We're just doing what any human being would do if there was no boss around.  Enough of you.  Right.  What?  You're a goody two-shoer and you're going to stay?  Yeah.  Even though you have no boss?  Line of the day is sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite.  Let me tell you what these people are doing.  Yes.  They back up the computer.  They freeze Han Solo.  Boo.  Who fucking cares what Hamza Bin Laden says?  Bin Laden's son released a poem?  Who gives a fuck?  He's just going into the family. 
[03:21:30]  He has 18 sons?  Hickory dickory dog.  Right.  The Jews all suck by God.  You know what's hilarious about that?  Everyone is surprised that Bin Laden's son is writing a poem.  He's just going into the family business like any other dude would do.  What do you expect him to be doing?  Bin Laden has 18 sons.  He's been doing some fucking.  Jesus Osama gets pussy.  Yeah.  He doesn't play games.  No belly loads for him.  Take it in the womb, bitch, or don't take it at all. 
[03:22:00]  No shitter, no mouth.  Womb or bust.  He's a signer on his balls.  They don't mention how many daughters he has, but 18 sons and this youngest one is 16.  Yeah.  18 fucking sons.  Yeah.  Fucking A.  My girl just got the ELO news.  She rules.  Holy shit about ELO.  Oprah, you're not going to be allowed to even speak to him anymore.  I know.  That's so true.  I'm not kidding because ELO and I became friends over the years. 
[03:22:30]  You know, he's a good man, but there's no fucking way he's going to ever be able to  talk to me, you, or Jimmy again.  Done.  He'll talk to me again.  Those shock jocks.  I'm actually doing something for Oprah.  Oh, are you?  Yes.  What?  Private party.  Where are you driving her?  Private party, huh?  She wants to see her children's.  And I was going to say, I want you to drive me back.  In the color purple, you want to choke that white bitch to death? 
[03:23:00]  Why?  Because she wanted to ride home.  I kind of liked her.  We would take you home.  She was sassy.  You wanted to, her face.  Whoever casted that woman as the old white cunt that Oprah wanted to spend time with.  Need old white cunt for.  Whoever casted that woman should be fucking given an Oscar for casting, because every time  I see the color purple, I want to grab that woman's face and squish it as I would shit.  I want to see my children's.  I just want to see her kids.  Yeah. 
[03:23:30]  Could you go to improve?  Improv, I guess it would be, right?  Because there would be an extra E.  Okay.  Improvereverywhere.com.  What is that site?  You have to check out.  I have no idea what it means.  You have to check out the shirtless mission on improveverywhere.com.  Yeah, these are those guys that.  It goes perfect with your Abercrombie rant a few months back.  Mike L.  Thank you, Mike L. from Minnesota.  Yes.  Those guys do the same.  You know, like when they did that Grand Central Station stunt where they just froze in the middle of time. 
[03:24:00]  Grand Central, so everybody freaks out about it.  It's those guys.  They do stunts like that all the time.  Wait, how many of them did that?  Were they just stopped?  It was a bunch of them, man.  It was like, I think they had a decent amount of people, like 100, 200 people.  They got to do that.  That's so cool.  One of the latest things I was just reading about that they did was they got, I think,  16 pairs of identical twins and set them all up in a subway car across from each other.  So it looked like they were sitting across from a mirror and people were just getting on the train and like freaking out and not knowing what to do.  A little fucked up. 
[03:24:30]  That's fucking brilliant, man.  That's a good one.  Those are great stunts to do.  See, I had a different idea for a stunt where I was going to yell like fucking leave a briefcase  with smoke coming out of it, yell terror on a plane.  Nobody would laugh at that.  Of course not.  All right.  Oh, that is cool.  Go to improv everywhere.com.  Can we go underground and maybe do one of these stunts?  Yes.  Can we?  I like to improv.  I'll improv.  My website is called Improv Nowhere.  I want. 
[03:25:00]  How about we do this?  We go very underground and we set up a stunt where everyone just, I don't know, buys a ping pong ball.  It goes into a very, very public place.  At a certain time, everyone just shows up.  Shoves it up their ass.  And throws their ping pong ball.  Oh, I thought they would just put them in their ass.  Well, that could be good, too.  That'd be cool.  And then shoots it out of their ass.  And then shoot it out.  Big shit covered.  Ping pong ball. 
[03:25:30]  Let's do the ping pong stunt.  Where can we do the ping pong stunt?  Steve?  Everyone has to like synchronize their phones and their clocks.  They show up like all at the same time.  You don't show up early with your ping pong ball and you release your ping pong ball and leave.  Can someone get Steve?  What is it?  Steve.  Steve who?  How did we get sidetracked from leaving early?  Steve, what do you think about the ping pong idea?  Trying to get us back on that track. 
[03:26:00]  Is it possible?  How many people do you want to organize?  I don't know.  Ping pong.  You can't really throw anything because that's the problem.  Yeah.  What do you think of the ping pong idea?  Can we organize?  Are we talking about 20 people, 30 people, 50 people to unleash ping pong balls?  I don't think we should unleash them because that can cause, like what these guys do is  they don't throw anything because if one person gets fucked up.  How do you get fucked up by a ping pong ball?  It panics them and they fall.  I'm telling you. 
[03:26:30]  This is what assholes people have.  Hold on.  Hello.  Yes.  Pussy's anonymous?  Yes.  I am propped on the phone.  What is that?  Sorry.  I'm just teasing.  You're improv.  All right.  Let's just do line of the day then and get the fuck out of here because who gives a shit  at this point?  Carbonite.com does something with computers.  I don't know what.  You might want to look them up online.  It's easy.  They back up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any of your  files.  I actually like that.  You can check it out at carbonite.com. 
[03:27:00]  Promo code XM.  Oh.  But how do you back up a computer?  Just push it.  Back that.  Back that pizza.  Thanks.  Back it up.  Just sit on it and go in reverse.  Let's do the first runner-up line of the day.  Well, the world don't move to the beat of just one drum.  What might be right for you may not be right for some.  A man is born. 
[03:27:30]  He's a man of means.  Then along come to.  They got nothing but the genes, but they got different strokes it takes.  Different strokes it takes.  Different strokes.  Everybody's got a special kind of story.  Why?  Everybody finds a way to shine.  Kirk Cubs' theme song.  It don't matter that you got.  Not a lot.  So what?  They'll have theirs and you'll have yours and I'll have mine.  Sam, so you went down to the New York Times building this morning, didn't you? 
[03:28:00]  That was a complete waste of time.  Whose idea was that?  Yeah.  Who thought that would make a good runner-up line of the day?  I think that was Travis.  Travis?  Stop trying to do conceptual art and paint the fucking fruit in the bowl.  Exactly.  We tell dick jokes.  Stop.  What the fuck was that?  You should have had one line from it.  Like the opening line and everybody would have dropped it.  Mm-hmm.  God. 
[03:28:30]  Everybody would have said, I'll give a good one on Sam.  Dog killed for that.  Another runner-up line of the day.  The beautiful Erica Nagel.  The buxotic Erica Nagel.  I defy you to breathe while he talks to you.  By the way, the people have spoken and they said, well, Blue Heeler is representing the  fans today and he says, Opie and Jimmy are allowed to leave early. 
[03:29:00]  Anthony's not.  He owes us an hour for that bullshit back to the doucher talk.  You know something?  Go fuck yourself.  Back to the future talk.  It was great.  Probably some of the best radio ever.  What's Sam's new bit?  The street thing.  Oh.  What's the haps?  What the haps?  What's the haps?  Did you guys do Back to the Future shit yet?  Terrible.  What's the haps?  Yeah, I went down to try to ask some of the people on the sneaker line what's the haps. 
[03:29:30]  But there was only like a dozen people there so far.  So we got a couple people and then tomorrow morning we're going to go down and see if the  line.  Because the shoes don't go on sale until Saturday.  Do you get anything that's worth playing tomorrow?  Yeah, man.  People love Back to the Future.  They have no clue, right?  Some of them don't know the movie.  And they're online to get the sneakers?  Yeah, they're all waiting for the Back to the Future.  Oh, that's going to be good, man.  Some of them.  One guy said he was just a fan of Kobe.  All right.  Well, Sam is just developing the bit as we speak.  So what are you going to ask them tomorrow?  Hopefully we'll have something by tomorrow. 
[03:30:00]  What are you going to ask them?  Just Back to the Future questions and stuff.  Yeah, all kinds of Back to the Future questions.  Like, what's Biff's grandson's name?  Oh.  You got to ask them what event they're going to wear their sneakers to.  Just be clueless that they're collectors.  Or since the movie happened, what is the hottest thing Michael J. Fox has spilled over himself?  Not that she won't have anything, but what's that, gazpacho? 
[03:30:30]  Here's some soup for you.  Stupid.  Nice and chilly the way you like it.  Some fucking cold beet salad.  Carry that, you fucking clod.  Fucking, here's a sippy cup.  You and the baby share cups.  Tea with a straw.  Steve's writing again.  Steve, you got a mic.  What are you writing?  Jot, jot, jot. 
[03:31:00]  Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle.  I was just telling you.  Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle.  What?  Thank you.  I was just telling you.  Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle.  Doodle, doodle.  Oh, I get it.  I do nothing and I doodle.  Oh, okay.  That was it.  Um, I was just telling you.  Two things I like that a rooster says cock-a-doodle.  I tend to doodle a cock.  Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle. 
[03:31:30]  Cock, cock, cock.  I can't even.  Um, I was telling you.  Why doodle a cock when you could suck a cock?  Jesus.  That's a super bad thing, you know.  What do you got there, Steve?  What?  Nothing.  I was just telling Sean.  What do you got?  I was telling Butcher to do an intro for Sam's What's the Haps?  Because I think that would be very fitting.  Hey, here's another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:32:00]  E-Rock, do something.  Great nerd humor, huh?  Wait, can there be an alternative July 9th at 8 a.m.?  I actually, uh, enjoyed that segment today.  We did too.  And, uh...  We all be an Anthony show.  All right, let's get out of here.  Sounds good.  That's my voice.  That's it?  I'll bite your tattoos off.  Another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:32:30]  Here we go.  Larry King is singing Happy Birthday!  And Ringo's smiling because he knew George Harrison's holding his head going, ouch!  Will you leave him alone?  God damn.  Always fucking funny.  We get obsessed with the stupidest things on this show.  All the George Harrison cancer head jokes.  Do you think he ever held his head, though, and just went, ouch! 
[03:33:00]  As if there was music too loud that no one else could hear.  Ouch!  Ouch!  Me head!  That's probably when they knew they had to take him to the doctor.  Where's Dad?  He's on the floor again going, ouch!  Holding his head.  Me head!  Stupid George.  By the way, let it be noted that Eric Logan's email has already been shut off.  Oh, that's good.  Wow.  Is he calling our show?  Nice wig, shit dick. 
[03:33:30]  Doubt it.  Sergeant Pepper's pudding head.  Oh, fuck.  Maybe the Beatles.  Who said they were bigger than God?  John Lennon?  Yeah.  That was smart, huh?  Oh, God took him out.  Gabe Jordan Harrison.  Yeah, from laughing at the joke.  Made Paul McCartney marry a one-legged bitch. 
[03:34:00]  While my family gently weeps.  Motherfuckers, we're going to make it to 11 now.  Oh, I know why.  Why?  In honor of Eric Logan, we're leaving early today.  Yes.  Uh, the last runner-up line of the day.  In, uh, 1985.  Mm-hmm.  Which one?  I, uh...  I and Jimmy...  Of course! 
[03:34:30]  I and Jimmy don't get that.  Which one?  In a second.  Which one?  Why would that be funny, though?  We all know there are alternate 1985s, based on what happens when the timeline shot off  into another direction there.  See, Ope, what happened was, is that...  Ah, no!  See, old Biff went back in time.  He gave the sports...  Here's line of the day!  Here's line of the day!  Here's line of the day!  Old Biff gave the sports...  Damn it.  I wanted to get that out. 
[03:35:00]  Never hear it enough.  Light of the day!  Light of the day!  Light of the day!  Now, Biff, don't con me!  You got me!  You got me!  All right, stop it!  For the love of God, get stuck!  Holy...  Not only am I gay and incompetent, but I'm stupid. 
[03:35:30]  Sorry, almost stepped on Steve's improv.  Not only am I gay and incompetent, but I'm stupid.  That'll help us in the lawsuit.  Thank God we have that for our lawyer.  All right, we gotta go.  Jimmy, why were you laughing over there?  I was only thinking of the hat.  The fucking hat with gutters.  I was just thinking of how George Harrison did nothing to deserve the teasing he gets.  The brutalizing he gets. 
[03:36:00]  At every chance, George Harrison mush under the hat joke.  There's nothing we enjoy more than a fucking skull-o-putting reference.  I don't know why.  Because the cancer heartens.  It doesn't get soft and mushy.  But the thought of...  The picture I got in my mind of him wearing a hat with gutters.  And the gutters just are leaking.  His head looks like a chicken pot pie. 
[03:36:30]  Pat from Monocleum.  While my head gently seeps.  Okay, that's a good one.  Old cunt ass comes out with a funny one.  I can't believe I can't think of one Beatles song.  Such a fucking fool.  Someone mark the calendar.  We did 15 minutes extra of radio today than we were going to do. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, I know it's before 11.  Yeah, but still.  We were going to be out of here by 11.30, 11.35-ish.  So we did an extra 15 minutes.  Just let it be noted, okay?  We leave you with this.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Well, the world don't move  To the beat of just one drum  What might be right for you  May not be right for some  A man is born  He's a man of means  Then along  They got nothing but their dreams 
[03:37:30]  But they got  Different strokes it takes  Different strokes it takes  Different strokes  Everybody's got a special kind of story  Everybody finds a way to shine  Kirk Douglas' theme song  It don't matter that you got  Not a lot  So what?  They'll have theirs  And you'll have yours  And I'll have mine  Sam, so you went down  And you guys will be fine  Different strokes it takes 
[03:38:00]  Different strokes it takes  Different strokes it takes  Different strokes it takes  All right  Push  Die  Die  Die  Push  Damn  You've just been pwned
