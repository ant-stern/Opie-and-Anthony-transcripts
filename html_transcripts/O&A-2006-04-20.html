<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, reacting to negative newspaper headlines, including nicknames like "Dopey Opie" and "Pervy Pal," speculating about the author's identity and motives.  Initial listener calls are hampered by technical difficulties.  The show then covers various topics: Oliver Stone's controversial 9/11 movie; the "cougar" phenomenon, discussed with humorous commentary based on a New York Post article;  American Idol results and alleged voting manipulation; and ongoing technical issues.  Jimmy Norton participates in several segments, including a bit where he pretends to be outside the studio and a discussion of his imaginary childhood friend, Helen.  A listener shares a story about a friend dating a much older woman.  The show plays a previously recorded bit, “Bill’s Dead,” in both English and Spanish, followed by a humorous promotion for "The Black Ninja."

Patrice O'Neal joins the discussion, prompted by receiving 9/11 conspiracy theory messages.  This leads to a comedic debate between O'Neal and Anthony, focusing on the speed of the Twin Towers' collapse, the Pentagon impact, and the lack of investigation. Opie's malfunctioning Blackberry, sending blank "m4m massage" emails, provides comedic relief.  Callers offer diverse opinions on the conspiracy theories.  A caller mistakenly identified as a physicist (actually a pharmacist) attempts to contribute to the physics of the event.  The debate involves discussions about potential planted explosives and the plausibility of the official account.  Cumia and O'Neal agree to a future two-hour show dedicated to a full-scale debate on 9/11 conspiracy theories, with each bringing in expert support.

Patrice O'Neal remains in studio for a segment dissecting the top ten country songs, with the hosts guessing song meanings before hearing the lyrics. This segment is filled with crude and sexually explicit jokes targeting truckers, further references to 9/11 conspiracy theories, and frequent interruptions from callers, many of whom are truckers. A running gag involves prematurely placed lyrics.  A brief discussion about Opie's past encounter with Henry Rollins occurs, along with heavy promotion for Patrice's upcoming relationship advice show on XM202.

The show continues with more offensive jokes about abusive relationships and country music, inventing humorous, offensive song titles and attributing them to fictional country singers.  A countdown of fake country songs with absurd titles follows, alongside crude humor about sonograms and pregnancy.  Henry Rollins joins the show, and the conversation shifts to his projects, including his IFC show featuring musicians like Ozzy Osbourne.  Discussions include Black Sabbath's influence, Rollins's travels (including the Trans-Siberian Express), anecdotes from his travels often involving seedy or dangerous situations, and his physical fitness.  Jimmy Norton shares sexually explicit anecdotes.  The conversation also touches on celebrity encounters (including a negative one with Carmen Electra's publicist), Rollins's opinions on 9/11 conspiracy theories, and promotions for Rollins’s show and upcoming performances.  The show concludes with this promotional information.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Oh, but more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  All of the radio rips me off, all of the radio rips me off, beyond AM, beyond FM is XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:00]  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  He's a freak.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  God, why don't you put so many jerseys in the world at the same time? 
[00:05:30]  I got an idea.  I got an idea.  I got an idea.  Yeah.  Why don't we just play music today? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, a music show.  Lots and lots of music.  Wow.  Good morning and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Good morning.  Did everyone sleep well?  Hmm?  Sleep.  Sleep?  What the hell is that?  What's sleep?  Who needs sleep?  Sleep is stupid.  I got used to not sleeping a long time ago.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Wake up bright and early, Opie.  Bright, early, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  Hmm.  Well, how is everybody today?  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, boys.  Anything interesting in the papers?  No.  Nothing good?  Nothing before page nine.  Pervy pal?  Why do I get to be Pervy pal? 
[00:07:00]  I've never had a good name in a headline.  Ever.  Pervy pal.  Pervy pal!  Hello, my Pervy pal.  Good morning, Dopey Opie.  Jesus Christ, it never ends.  Pervy pal will be taken on Whackbag within minutes.  Pervy pal.  I'm sure Pervy pal is already named on Whackbag.  My Pervy pal.  Wow.  I guess the post doesn't have a sense of humor when we trash them on a daily basis.  Well, apparently, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  I guess somebody that might have been listening and heard us goofing on their comedy bits that they like putting in their paper, their little top six list that they had yesterday, or their funny headlines.  Maybe they didn't like that.  And now they're getting us back by calling us Dopey Opie and Pervy Pal.  Good old Pervy Pal.  What the hell is Jimmy?  Chopped liver?  If you're Pervy Pal.  Oh, I know.  If I'm Pervy Pal...  Yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Child killer chip.  Child killer chum.  Horrid.  I did not appreciate that.  I know John Minnelli is like, you know, he's had a good relationship with us over the years, but I don't think they come up with the headlines.  That's what these writers always say.  Whenever they write a story and there's a really bad headline for it and you confront them, they go, hey, we don't write the headlines.  We learned a while ago that there's just one guy, and that's his whole... 
[00:08:30]  I think that's lying.  And that's his whole job is just to write headlines.  Write headlines.  In the paper.  He doesn't write the actual stories.  You know, the stories are handed in, he reads the story real fast, and then he's the clever one at the paper, and he comes up with the headline.  But wouldn't you be pissed if you're a writer and...  Yeah, of course.  The eye-catcher that makes people go to your story that you toiled over is something ridiculous or doesn't really fit the story well, or...  Of course.  Yeah, you'd be, like, kind of pissed at that.  But the writers aren't smart enough to come up with the headlines.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  That's what they're telling the writers.  How about you just take the first sentence of your story, and that's the headline, and then you continue.  I don't know why there has to be a headline writer that has to write Dopey Opie and Pervy Pal.  It's usually Dopey and Anthony, or Dopey and Dopey, Pervy Pal.  What the fuck am I, I'm here like a monkey.  I'm just jerking off and throwing feces at guests when they come in.  Oh, you're trying to say it's not accurate? 
[00:09:30]  All right, there have been a few instances where I might have earned the moniker, but...  Jesus.  While he's bumbling around going, duh, you're patting the fanny of a lad who's dressed like Angus Young.  Yeah, there you go.  And Opie just looks and goes,  And I'm just on the subway cranking one out in front of Asian girls.  Click.  click you know this takes the cake as they as some people would like to yes you know we've 
[00:10:00]  we've seen our share of headlines over the years certainly have maybe maybe erot could be useful  today and uh no stop right come up with some of our old headlines yeah because they are entertaining  but today pervy pal my pal the perv ah right dopey ov i'm proud to be here you know what though the  dopey opi is so expected that's i know well that's why it's the easiest thing to do with opi yeah what  what else do you rhyme with it uh mopey scully opi scully opi i don't know what else you mopey 
[00:10:30]  mopey if he was in a bad mood he said mopey opi mouths off about and then whatever i've seen  dopey opi a million times opi and dopey was usually the headline we've seen opi that was the big one  when we got the boot right put opi and dopey yeah maybe if he's all positive you could call him  hopey hopey hopey hopey that would be good norm the trucker uh he's got a good point here norm 
[00:11:00]  what's up hey guys uh short-term listener first time caller um wanted to say maybe there's a comma  missing and it was dopey being anthony opi and pervy pal because i think pervy pal i always have to  speak uh little jimmy you know if there was a comma there it would save me and i would once again  only be dopey because it would be dopey opi and jimmy the pervy pal i think they're acknowledging

[00:19:00]  i got scared ah christ on a pony anyway my god  yeah hey american idol was uh fantastic last night did you uh see it any surprises i think  they're lying to us on that show you think i think they're absolutely lying when they split up  the uh contestants into the groups i think they say that it's the bottom three and the top three as 
[00:19:30]  far as the america's uh voting is gone and chris and paris chris daughtry paris whatever her last  name is yeah and uh ace ace young were in one group and i'm like there's no way because i know ace  is awful and had to go but chris and paris in the bottom three couldn't happen they were uh they were  the best i think out of uh uh the performances well now katherine mcphee she was good she was she was 
[00:20:00]  the best right up there then it should have been night it should have been her chris and paris  yeah but but it's too obvious that way they don't they don't they love the surprises even from the  beginning when they go into the rooms and tell that room full of people whether they've made it or not  and they go oh sorry we had to come in here to tell you that you're not going home you're going  they go wow they love the surprise yeah and it would be no surprise if you knew the top three  because you saw how good they were uh so i think they mix it up i think they're lying so they put one 
[00:20:30]  of the bottom three in with two at the top which i think they did i think that there's a lot of uh  people out there voting that uh just figure chris daughtry was a sure in that everyone else was  going to vote for him yeah so and i think at this stage in the game you have a few favorites because  you've been watching the show a long time right so you're like you know what uh ah man chris daughtry  is going to get all the votes so i might as well try to save kelly pickler with my vote this week 
[00:21:00]  and she needed saving and she needed saving and all of a sudden a lot of people thought that way and  next thing you know chris daughtry doesn't get a lot of votes because you're right it doesn't make  sense on any level that he would be the bottom three because him or paris he's pretty much going to be  the winner of this thing yeah or the runner-up at the worst so they're doing this just to keep the  suspense so that when there's two groups of three people you know that you don't sit there knowing  that all right it's going to be someone in the group they love the twist and last night that was 
[00:21:30]  huge yeah that was everybody went like get the fuck out because on one side you had kelly pickler  elliott and uh katherine mcphee yeah and katherine mcphee was one of the strong ones from tuesday  and then on the other side you had chris daughtry who was one of the strong ones paris  was very strong and an ace yeah an ace who just stinks so glad he's gone don't have to look into  those vacant eyes lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes well he'll never sing a song again here's the 
[00:22:00]  announcement from last night two guys who are like the matt damon and ben affleck oh yeah just in case  you missed it though so then it comes down to chris daughtry and ace are on the stage and one of  them's going home yeah and they show chris daughtry's wife and friends and they're all worried oh my  god oh my god no and then at that point what's a sure in did i say sure a shoe in a shoe in sorry  the shoe in sorry we're preoccupied today are you guys really are you guys thinking all day about my 
[00:22:30]  chicago gigs tonight and this weekend it's all that's been on my mind jimmy chicago gigs pervy  pal all right i'm sorry ellis disappointed you let's say hi to ellis ellis all right he's gone  exactly as he should be all right here's uh the announcement so it's chris daughtry and ace young  on the stage and one of them's going home i wonder who it would be two guys who are like the matt damon  and ben affleck of american idol best of friends here one of them leaving us in a second on american 
[00:23:00]  idol simon you took credit for chris last night doing a great job you take credit for him about  to go home possibly standing here before us i wasn't the one who was singing ryan what are your thoughts  about these two ace i think you're going to end up going home tonight results time america  the person with the lowest number of votes leaving us is ace  chris you are safe 
[00:23:30]  man yeah he dodged a bullet that's it i think he was one of the number one or two votes voted people  i don't think he was uh the the bottom three never mind bottom three he was like  second to last is that what they're saying out of all the people up there chris daughtry was  second to last in votes that's impossible that part is impossible they're pulling shenanigans 
[00:24:00]  by the way uh uh-huh no one's calling the show today yeah phones either broken or deathly silent or  uh they're being screened uh travis has his thumb up his ass no there's no one calling the show  see it's it's it's a weird morning let's just be honest with each other strange it's a very strange  morning and uh and not one phone call coming in i mean you know a little odd 
[00:24:30]  that doesn't make any sense ope huh no no no one call i i honestly i think the phone system can't  handle what's going on right now and i'm not even joking yeah i know our enemies would go see this  proves that no one's listening to them they said this morning on the show that no one was calling  exclamation point exclamation point capital letters angry fan wow great angry typing guy 
[00:25:00]  oh i cannot keep track of everything that is uh is that is being printed yeah things uh have a  tendency to go viral sometimes maybe yeah maybe i should uh punch up instant feedback today  yeah yeah maybe i should pop that up that would be what people are saying that's another way for the  listeners to get through well we're trying to uh read the instant feedback again yeah we neglected that 
[00:25:30]  for a while because stupid us we'd rather look at boobs on pal talk than read yeah i know we really  are unprofessional what uh you don't want to talk about okay what happened with just tuned in  comment fmq just curious to hey let no are you guys going to all right instant feedback is useless  today and looks like the phones are useless too all right the phones are useless and i can't read one

[00:36:30]  yeah that that might have worked in 1956 oh my god the writing in the post is horrific  prowl into new york city's hottest scene older women young guys  the article starts ew with a lot of h's be very very quiet we're trekking cougar cougars urban  ah there's one now down at the end of the bar ain't she a beaut mate about 45 years old and a 
[00:37:00]  real ferocious hellcat she is blow her head off we'll just wait till she leans in for a sip and then  dot dot dot what i don't feel like reading exactly no but after dot dot dot you got a sip of what metamucil  well after the dot dot dot hi there would you pass me a napkin oh this is an article in the post  ah crikey she's pouncing on the bait somebody hit her with a tranquilizer dart no better still get her 
[00:37:30]  another cantaloupe martini cantaloupe martini of course uh it's dangerous business tracking a cougar  why a sophisticated species of female who seeks the pleasure of younger males these are 40-ish women  who have no qualms about picking up or getting picked up by the same boys they sent off to bed  for being naughty when they were babysitters men their own age they've been there done that collected 
[00:38:00]  the alimony oh is that what that is or is it the fact that men their own age want nothing to do with  them right because of their stupid wrinkled faces men their own age are out hunting for 18 year olds  and so it's either sit alone or go out and become a cougar the only thing you say to a cougar is  is your daughter here point her out exactly let's see uh cosmo talks about the cougar thing of course  it does it says rather than work on a relationship that might not go anywhere it's better to go younger 
[00:38:30]  and friskier women get the athletic sex and let's face it guys get the easy sex you're right see  they're saying it's an easy yeah anyway the article goes on and on and on and on and on and on and  talk about some of the clubs and bars in new york city where you could find the cougars because  they're hanging out there just waiting for you any tactics i guess but i didn't read this thing yeah  no uh that stupid reading gets in the way all the time reading nothing's highlighted or anything 
[00:39:00]  there's probably some great tactics on how to bring one down yeah because someone bear trap on a bar  stool will you leave a fucking depend undergarment in the middle yeah can someone like can someone  highlight the good stuff on this or you dangle a charm bracelet in front of her and when she starts  to say that looks like my grandson you crack her in the back of her wig give her a good sodomizing  while she tips over the chair all right wait now i gotta carefully i gotta carefully rip out the 
[00:39:30]  middle part because we could talk about that while someone highlights the rest of it good good job  because they have a you are a great newspaper ripper you see this look at the uh all right well  now you're blowing it okay he's under pressure i'm ripping her tit off right now well if you don't  make sure sorry old broad god damn jimmy i couldn't spit it out quickly enough awful joke  shouldn't pervy powell have delivered that what's this how did it come on perfect nice nice 
[00:40:00]  all right who could highlight this danny can of course you can yeah look for we're looking for  tactics on how to bring down these uh cougars all right so as uh danny highlights the good stuff  because we were too lazy to read the whole article uh the cougar breeds yeah there's a whole bunch of  categories and this is this is kind of where the bit gets fun oh good uh you want to start from the 
[00:40:30]  bottom up or the uh probably from the from from the top to the bottom would be great right yeah  yeah because first of all you got your top cats they're called top cats these cougars are the top  of the food chain uh food chain excuse me classy rich pampered and ultra hot all right find them  at hotel bars in the peninsula or essic house think ivana trump jerry hall or sarah ferguson  all right they got some cash they're looking good probably got a little work done got lots and 
[00:41:00]  lots of money a lot of work done you know they're old but they're trying but they're trying so much  work done it looks like she has a meaty slit between her bosoms wait a minute wasn't that  say say wasn't that somewhere else then you got the slut cat slut cat right below the top cat  these cleavage bearing twice divorced alley cats can be found shooting pool and chain smoking 
[00:41:30]  parliaments at dive bars on monday nights think janice dickinson and kim cattrall yeah sex in the  city totally you walk into a bar and you see one of those old broad shooting pool and there's like  guys around her vultures yeah she's just done then you got the euro cat again with the bull cue  the euro cat these sultry and sophisticated foreign felines have the olive skin and sexy  spanish and italian accents to match look for the gray armpit hair okay cage these cougars with a few 
[00:42:00]  uh salsa dancing moves oh they they love to dance the old broads yes yeah think isabella rosalini  yeah how about i don't well how about who's the one that played tony montana sister oh yeah  think i heard now let's uh let's go to the buff cat the buff cat these gravity defying fitness 
[00:42:30]  fanatics have the bods of women half their age keeping up with them is a workout and we're not  talking about the gym ah ha ha fucking i get it i better dump that oh no we don't have to dump yet  of course not uh i think madonna demi moore and jane fonda oh and then you got the rock cat you know  that's the traitor cat tells me the traitor cat fuck it with a north korean helmet over his face 
[00:43:00]  even though it was vietnam wrong war shit dick treasonous cat  those broads are the ones that uh look good with their clothes on maybe you know the buff cat  the buff cat yeah yeah once the clothes come off man and then you got the rock cat spot these  downtown rock and rollers by the badass tattoos and leather jackets  they're ferocious in the sack plus have stories about partying with the stones 
[00:43:30]  think chrissy hein yeah the kidney stones debbie harry and joan jet  wonderful what is that uh iraq is that her now yeah  well she looks like a cougar what's her real name could be let's go to uh carl in new york carl  what's up hey how you doing today what's up hot carl nice guy listen hey you guys yeah listen uh  when i was 16 i lost my charitable woman i was twice my age and uh and all up and through my 30s 
[00:44:00]  i was going out i was always hunting for uh older women because it was nice easy quick way there was  no mind games it was like hey you want to fuck let's fuck um instead of trying to deal with girls  my own age you know teens and in the 20s got to play around a little bit it was easier just to  pick up an older woman that's all it was to it easier yeah it was just an easy lay yes it was because 
[00:44:30]  they knew what they wanted and they and i wanted the same thing so yeah i mean it was just easy my  thought on this is if you're a cougar and you're out at a bar you don't have morals at that point  neither did i have morals but movies or tv shows kind of want to romanticize it and let the cougar  think that she's you know something a looker and the guys are after them because of that and not  because they're the you know the wounded gazelle on the plains of the serengeti not gonna happen  guys no they want they want to get fucked and they want to get fucked good they're not with their old 
[00:45:00]  man and they want and they want somebody young and that can last and just pound it to them and  and i was glad but anthony's on to something the cougars think they're sexy and hot right and still  relevant out there in the dating world or in the bar world the reality is they're one step above your  pillow yeah it's either go home and you know have sex with your pillow or bring one of these bras home  easy pickings well i'm 46 now and i'm not looking for older women i'm looking for still somebody in 
[00:45:30]  their 30s maybe you know something like that you know right i'm not cruising for older chicks these  days if you can't find one why don't you just go like to the doctor's office and take some white  nurse shoes and stick them under that skeleton he has in his office and jerk off to that it's creepy  find a teenager good advice jimmy good advice all right thanks carl let's go to jack and put a  fucking flowered hat on it just jerk off i've been kind of scolding you about this oh sorry uh oh it's  all right uh dude i when uh i had a roommate uh i don't follow whatever he listens to the show

[01:19:30]  this  oh that's all  good stuff  yeah  oh okay  that's all good  that's interesting  all right  hey uh  so what are you  talking about  messaging me  after after the  9-11 thing  i started getting  all type of  warrior emails  to say  go fuck yourself  they started  sending me  email email  uh uh  what do you call  links  to all  type  and they were  going  patrice  fucking  fight hard  buddy  that was  like this  big dumb 
[01:20:00]  nigga  fucking  info  all right  i did get  those text  messages  on the way  to boston  big i mean  like there's  one guy  scientific  like like  there was  scholars for  9-1-1  like not  not kooks  like science  this one guy  scientific fact  talking about  the way  just one  thing  talking about  the way  buildings  things come  down on  like dropping  the egg  he said  dropping the  egg  from the  top of the 
[01:20:30]  world trade  center  would take  8 seconds  for the  egg to hit  the ground  that's how  long it took  for the  buildings to  fall  ready  he said  even let's  say if you  go  the fact that  it falls  and it has  to hit  each floor  and the  pressure  from each  floor  falling  to the  pressure  of the  next floor  giving way  let's say  it was  110 stories  how you  figured it  out  let's say  it fell  from the  96th floor  so if you  gave it  a half a  second  a half a  second  to fall 
[01:21:00]  and then  the pressure  of the  other floor  to hold  itself  and then  fall  a half a  second  it would  have took  46 seconds  for the  fucking  buildings  to fall  that's  science  nigga  science  it wouldn't  have took  8 seconds  for the  fucking  building  to fall  why would  each one  get a  half second  if the  additional  weight  falling  on each  one  is  additional  additional  additional  why a  half  second  why wouldn't  it go  faster  a second  was good  not only 
[01:21:30]  that  a second  isn't good  in that  that is  implying  that  it fell  one floor  at a  time  when it  started  coming  down  there  were  multiple  floors  smashing  at the  same  time  multiple  floors  coming  down  giving  resistance  he said  if you  drop an  egg  off the  top  of the  fucking  building  without  resistance  it would  take 8 seconds  a fucking  building  that was  made out  of steel  and that  it fell  in what  he said  its own  footprint  which means  it fell 
[01:22:00]  straight  fucking  down  as opposed  to  it  falling  down  funny  little  thing  called  gravity  and it  pulls  straight  down  but  you're  talking  as if  one  floor  hit  the  next  floor  and  now  it's  two  floors  and  then  it's  three  floors  when it  fell  ten  floors  at a  clip  were  just  smashing  but it's  still  the  resistance  from  the  other  floors  resist  the  resistance  if it  was 
[01:22:30]  a half  of a  half  a  second  it would  still  be  20  seconds  it fell  in 8  seconds  how it  was  propelled  downward  faster  than  gravity  because  even  there's  no such  thing  as  faster  than  gravity  so  how  did  it  fall  faster  that  there  were  rocket  engines  there  pushing  it  down  it  was  demolished  professionally  wouldn't  it  still  have  to  fall  the  speed 
[01:23:00]  of  gravity  I  mean  it  was  still  no  because  that's  what  it  was  polarized  the  cement  that's  in the  middle  of each  floor  with  the  steel  was  pulverized  by  explosives  because  that's  how fast  a demolished  building  would fall  so not  only were  the  explosives  put in  the beams  that support  it  but  we had  to go  around  in  cubicles  and drill  in the  cement  floors  around  where  people  were  working  and  plant  explosives  anthony  wow  this  gets 
[01:23:30]  better  and  better  could  you  move  your  facts  first of all  the  buildings  are not  open  the  buildings  are not  open  25 hours a day  let's just  label it  D5  instead of  C4  that'll  confuse  the shit  out of  them  the  security  guards  said  listen  man  people  were sending  me all  type  of shit  and I  was  watching  it  shit  is a  good  word  for it  I 
[01:24:00]  cannot  this is  scholars  for not  people  accredited  motherfuckers  from MIT  believe that  these  buildings  and I  got another  email about  the same  type of  thing  and they're  just  stealing  JFK  the one  guy  goes  NORAD  was told  to  stand  down  stand  down  really  Sutherland  speech  in JFK  whoever sent  me that  email  shut  your  teenage  face  shut  it  take  us  Def  Con  1  let's  go to  Tim  on  Long  Island  Tim  you  sack  out  piece  of  shit  alright 
[01:24:30]  let's  go  Tim  get in  here  hey  did  one  call  about  Patrice's  theory  here  there's  a  problem  it's  not  mine  I'm  just  copying  what  I  heard  Patrice's  not a  thinker  he's  copy  paste  I'm  just  repeating  what  another  motherfucker  said  hold on  but  pretty  much  all  of  America  is  copy  paste  by the  way  let me  say  something  about  you  feel  like  you're  an  expert  even  your  disagreements  are  copy  paste  motherfucker  so don't  forget  that  hold on 
[01:25:00]  sir  let me  say  something  about  Patrice  because  after  9-11  no one  was  fucking  louder  at the  comedy  cellar  table  with  the  chalk  doing  all the  numbers  and up  to  11  remember  that  I  know  you  believe  I  didn't  say  I  didn't  either  I  believed  it  until  September  13th  9 plus  2  good  point  all  9 plus  2  11  all  the  numbers  that  added up  9-11  every 
[01:25:30]  number  you did  that  the dates  added up  to 9-11  I  forgot  it was  fucking  5 years  ago  but  you  do  understand  that  the  craziest  people  in the  world  have  these  number  things  that  they  do  there  were  also  facts  that  were  wrong  on  that  equation  they  listed  the  wrong  number  of  passengers  when  you  look  at  9-11  it's  a 9  plus  2  1  9  10  11  flight  11  flight  93  92  no  flight  93  I  think  it  is  the  3  to 
[01:26:00]  represent  nothing  and then  flight  11  it's  a 9  but  when you  turn  the 3  this  way  it  looks  like  tits  and  there's  two  tits  so  9  isn't  it  hard  to  build  two  buildings  in  the  shape  of  an  18  it's  very  inconvenient  for  the  fucking  elevators  I  saw  a  27  building  in  Chicago  listen  science  man  this  is  the  problem 
[01:26:30]  with  the  clock  is  you're  talking  like  each  floor  is  a  structural  entity  unto  itself  it's  not  the  floors  are  actually  suspended  from  the  out  of  skin  of  the  building  so  once  that  building  starts  collapsing  those  floors  have  no  strength  at  all  they're  providing  no  they're  not  waiting  like  how  fast  did  they're  not  waiting  a half  a second  or nine  seconds  that's  how fast  it fell  they're not  waiting  at all  man  it's  just  going  right  through  I have  a special  which I  saw  not to  interrupt you  but I  have  a special  that I  saw  which I  have  on 
[01:27:00]  DVD  somewhere  of  why  the  building  stalled  the way  they  did  I  saw  that  same  it  had  something  to do  with the way  that they  were linked  they should  have been  they should  have been  the floor  should have been  hung in a  sturdier fashion  why didn't  the upper  part  when the  building  started collapsing  the upper  part above  where the  plane hit  did not  explode  there were  no  explosions  it didn't  collapse  until that  thing came  down and  hit the  ground  so how  do they  know  where  to plant  the  explosives  they planted  it all  through  the 
[01:27:30]  building  and  who's  to say  that  those  explosives  they didn't  know how  to set  off  the  explosives  where they  need to  set  them off  let me  ask you  if they  were going  to go  through  all  that  wouldn't  they  have  just  picked  guys  who are  dead  he  believes  it  but  there's  some  little  blockage  of  reasoning  that  makes  him  not  completely  believe  it  he's  being  a  devil's  advocate  so  he 
[01:28:00]  believes  it  in his  gut  because  being a  comic  you have  to have  this  kind  of  cynicism  towards  the  government  he  knows  cynicism  is one  thing  but  something  that  if you  said  to me  there  was  a  rogue  element  in  the  government  allegedly  in  world war  two  and  somebody  knew  that  was  going  to  happen  and  stood  back  and let  it  happen  maybe  a  couple  of  that  you  talk  about  implosions  and  and  and  and  and  and  then  bringing  the  buildings  down  and  Mohammed  Atta  not being  alive 
[01:28:30]  somewhere  and he's  living in  Ronkonkoma  but he's  walking around  going  I'm  Mohammed  Atta  and they're  going  no  you're  dead  he loves  me  and I'm  a comic  well he's  from Jersey  he knows  you fucking  know  I  really  don't  I  actually  look  I asked  for  credible  I said  please  because  me and  Tim Young  were talking  Tim's a  comedian  and when  Tim goes  well you  know  WTC7  when he  said  WTC7  if he  couldn't  beat me  to death  I would  have hit  him  Tim's a  psycho 
[01:29:00]  and he  could  really  hurt  me  so I  just  nod  to  Joe  the  trucker  Joe  what's  up  hey  how you  doing  hey  let's  go  Joe  you  got  to  get  right  in  today  okay  sorry  about  that  hey  there  was  a little  bit  of  difference  between  a  concrete  floor  I don't  think  you got  your  comparison  let's  go to  Mark  astrophysics  proves  Patrice  wrong  Mark  I don't 
[01:29:30]  know  what  kind  of  physics  it is  but  when  each  floor  starts  falling  it  exponentially  will  fall  with  more  and  more  pressure  I  said  that  yes  so  there's  no  way  that  it  would  take  you  it  was  milliseconds  that  yeah  it  wouldn't  you  start  this  argument  by  saying  a  second  per  floor  there's  no way  it's  going to  be  a  half  a  second  this  is  the  problem  with  the  show  do  any  physicists  listen  to  this  we  have  a  lot  of  I 
[01:30:00]  live  in my  building  is one  of the  greatest  fucking  honest to  God  one  of the  greatest  theoretical  physicists  in the  world  why would  I  hi  you  don't  know  me  who  do  you  think  killed  everyone  in the  world  trade  you  ask  transvestites  no I  don't  I  close my  eyes  and enjoy  no one knows  nothing  another thing  why my brain  is like  no one knows  nothing  okay 
[01:30:30]  uh  uh  uh  forensic  study  of the  of the  of the  fucking  immediately  this is what I  remember from just  watching this new  shit I'm watching  immediately  immediately  hold on let  him talk  god damn  it  immediately  they  came in  and took  away  the fucking  evidence of  the buildings  for the physical  evidence of the  buildings  for now  now  they were  looking for  bodies  no man  hold on let  them  TWA  the TWA  flight  right  they dug 
[01:31:00]  fucking plane  debris out of  the ocean  to put that  fucking plane  back together  right  to see what  the fuck  happened  they did  not  see what  happened  to the world  train  everyone saw  but no  they did  not do  a  what  made  the  fucking  the  material  they did  not study  the material  they took  the fucking  buildings  away  here's the  problem  with that  if you  recall  there was a  fucking  frantic  rescue 
[01:31:30]  going on  he said  no  people wanted  to rescue  they actually  for a couple  of days  if you remember  they thought  they might  actually dig  some poor  son of a  bitch  out of  that mess  so they  brought in  cranes  and just  started  pulling  shit  out of  there  and where  are you  going to  put it  where are you  going to  put it  broadway  you can't  reconstruct it  right  and another  thing  there's no  when a plane  blows up in  the air  and goes in  the water  believe it or  not  it's a lot  easier to  pick the  pieces up  and put  them together  than it is  when it hits 
[01:32:00]  something at  500 miles an  hour and  ends up  little specks  of pretty much  nothing  did you see  footage of that  plane vaporizing  when it hit  the brick wall  they say  oh it never  would have  vaporized  and that's  the question  I ask  why did it  vaporize  when it hit  the pentagon  and then  someone sent  me a link  to a military  test that had  been done  about nuclear  reactors  they wanted  to see if it  could withstand  a plane crash  so they show  concrete being  hit by a plane  and there's no  resistance to the  concrete  it was like  the plane  didn't exist  turned into  dust  it was a perfect  hole in the 
[01:32:30]  side of the  pentagon  a perfect  round hole  they said  the holes  you're seeing  pictures of  inside were  done during  the rescue  effort  that was  not the  hole  they're saying  the plane  you are being  misled my brother  you really are  by who  by the Jews  fuck it  the one group  I agree with  here's a guy  that worked in  the world trade  center  let's see if  there was any  action going on  while he was  trying to do  his job  Billy what's up  hey boys  what's going on  Patrice man  I'm a cynic 
[01:33:00]  just as much  as the next  guy and always  into this  government  doing this  and that  but man  you're taking  it a little  bit too far  I'm just  repeating what  fucking white  people say  I'm repeating  everything I've  heard from  Billy Clark  from white  teenagers  I'm up on  the 65th floor  of the Empire  State Building  and during  9-11 we  watched the  whole thing  the first plane  went by the  building went  right down  5th Avenue  shook shit  off the shelves  in my office  yeah  because it was  doing about  500  and it was 
[01:33:30]  a complete  mess  and you know  what I guess  some people  want to be able  to point the  finger  they want to  have some  concrete evidence  that it's  this person's  fault  plenty of  fingers to  point  I'm not  in disagreement  I was as salty  I'm still salty  but I'm saying  I'm not saying  that it's a  complete  I'm saying  something  you can't say  that it's just  completely an accident  you're getting  no it wasn't  like the Poseidon  adventure  it was Arabs  that don't like us 
[01:34:00]  an accident  you know what I mean  an accident  killing us  that the government  that is starting  to point towards  more than just  Arabs  doing 20 years  who blew up  the trains  in Spain  Arabs  I believe that  who blows up  the friggin barracks  but they're able  to do this  who's hijacked  planes over the years  if listen  what I'm saying  is I believe it  because I just  believe it  there's no other  point  I'm only  watching these  things that  other people  are doing work  and raising  questions  everybody here 
[01:34:30]  is doing the same  they're made  with an agenda  you're making  a decision  on what to  believe  the things  you're watching  are made  created  with this  agenda  they twist  things around  and then present  them to you  in a twisted  inaccurate fashion  they don't do that  in the other  side  like your side  of the thing  I'm not looking  at some package  that's presented  as look at  the conspiracy  here it is  I made it  view this  I'm looking  at things like 
[01:35:00]  here is  file footage  from different  news agencies  of photographs  of the pentagon  it's not one  little hole  in the pentagon  it's a perfect hole  I'll punch it up  later after the show  I will show you  the real pictures  of the pentagon  and you will see  wing marks  engine marks  everything  this is what  we should do  I was talking  to Patrice  about this  we should do  a 9-11 show  I'll do it  on a Saturday  I don't know  are you into this  I'd be into it  absolutely  here's the deal  it's  Anthony picks  a team 
[01:35:30]  Patrice  picks a team  I pick white people  I'm going to  find me some  no you need  some backers  Tim Young  is a big  conspiracy guy  I'll get Tim Young  I need  no here's the deal  we'll give it  a couple weeks  to develop  but basically  Anthony obviously  doesn't believe  what you're saying  and let's do  a couple hours  and see what happens  blueprints  and everything  you get to study  for a couple weeks  you get to bring  in other people  I think you'd be  a reasonable person  like Anthony  who would you bring in  would you keep Jimmy  Jimmy's a half a traitor  Jimmy doesn't believe 
[01:36:00]  in it really  Jimmy actually  reads facts  and I raise questions  I said well  there were certain things  that were interesting  points raised  by conspiracy people  I said that Pentagon  the questions they raised  were interesting  when I was presented  with the facts  both sides  okay now I understand  why I believe  a plane hit the Pentagon  but I wanted to have  there were certain  questions that were  raised that I didn't like  I don't like the fact  that there's no photos  of it happening  and there's no video  I think it does exist  I think they're protecting  us from it  but I don't think  it's because it wasn't  a plane  I will bring in things 
[01:36:30]  on that day  I have documented evidence  I will bring in  you better get your shit  together if we're doing this  I will bring in pictures  charts graphs  blueprints  and actual witnesses  when was the last time  you read a blueprint  Patrice  I read a blueprint  in my sneaker collection  you never read a blueprint  I spent the shelf  I had blue balls one day  here's a blueprint  he would read  it's a girl lying on the bed  looking for love  and the blueprint  is his hand jerking off  on her  and then there's a blueprint  of the door  him opening it  and closing it 
[01:37:00]  and leaving her  when did this piece of shit  motherfucker  become like  the reason  yeah  it happened to be  this is what I'm saying  he's the dirtiest  hunk of shit ever  and he will  he will just sit there  and just explain me  jerking off  but I told him that  do you understand  what he'll repeat  he'll just repeat  well at least I'm not saying  it's science  he'll repeat something  I might have  I told him  that could have been  exaggerated  but I'm saying  he's repeating  he's just like  you saw a blueprint  you're just saying 
[01:37:30]  oh well this blueprint  is this  but you're discrediting  other stuff  that's just as credible  the hole in the side  of the building  why is your picture  the picture  the picture I saw  is some imaginary horse shit  that they made up  because I will also use  your picture  as one of the pictures  that show  a bigger picture  yeah  you're looking at  one little narrow  piece of information  you know  and if you zoomed in 
[01:38:00]  on that wall right there  you would see  a wall full of naked women  and now  if you presented  that picture to somebody  and you said  what type of room  was this taken in  there'd be speculation  that it could be anything  it could be  it could be  a playboy shoot room  it could be  a fucking porno  guy's fucking thing  it could be  a guy's bedroom  a teenage boy's bedroom  you pull back here  and take it  you know  it's a radio studio  I'm saying  you're looking  at a narrow  piece of information 
[01:38:30]  I'm looking at  four different angles  of the site  the angles that  there was another  fucking thing on that  the way the plane  would have had  to crash  it did  the plane would have  to go like this  the way the plane  crashed  it's like it was  driven into the side  that's what I'm saying  it's improbable  that's the word  improbable  improbable  it's probably  a one in a million  shot that that guy  hit the pentagon  why crash a plane 
[01:39:00]  then and why not  just have a shoulder  launcher  why not fire a missile  if you and I  if you're saying this  and I can hear you  saying it  then why wouldn't  people who are  brilliant enough  to plan this  make such basic  errors  like why would you  put a missile hole  and say it was a  767  they don't believe  how they believe  that we're dumb  they believe  this country  to be stupid  not that the way  information is passed  this is not JFK  even JFK  the conspiracy  became kind of like  geez that doesn't  look good  and that was in the  60s when they  had video cameras  there was five  videotapes taken  in 63  everything's videotaped 
[01:39:30]  now  they're gonna fire  a missile at a  building  and say it was a  plane  and not think  that anyone's  gonna  not think  that somebody  might have a  video camera  how do any conspiracy  theories that you  believe in wholeheartedly  I believe JFK  I believe a lot of  the conspiracy theorists  are wrong  but I do think  that there was  definitely not just  Oswald  yes  that one  I definitely  UFO  UFO conspiracies  but I mean  not as far  as they  presented  I believe  UFO conspiracies  not that there  are any  or there are  aliens  but I do  believe that  the government  kept information 
[01:40:00]  from the people  on things  that they were  working on  like nuclear  bombs and shit  I believe  and like  weird powered  devices  that kind of  looked like  flying saucers  in the desert  when people  would see that  and then the  government would  be like  we had nothing  flying in that  area  it's like  bullshit  that was one  of yours  that starts to  talk  because they  don't want to  admit that  they got  stuff in the air  although pilot  testimony convinces  me though  when you have  pilots saying  look this thing  I've heard  radar stuff  saying  you have  a craft 
[01:40:30]  going up  it's just  going like  400 miles an  hour  and then it  just goes up  800 miles an  hour straight up  I've heard  pilot transmissions  and radar  that type of  stuff is convincing  weird stuff  to a certain  degree  yeah  UFO is nothing  but an  unidentified  flying object  if you believe  in UFOs  but that's  different  UFO could be  anything  if you're  saying  flying saucers  aliens are  visiting  I definitely  believe in aliens  you believe they 
[01:41:00]  were here  flying around  and we caught  them  no one knows  what do you  believe  I can't imagine  we're the only  thing out there  I believe  that we're not  the only living  organism out there  but I don't  believe that  there's aliens  flying around  this planet  Carl Sagan  didn't believe  it either  I don't think  they've been here  he said that  the distances  were too great  that they exist  of course  but it was  just too far  to come  it could be  some incomprehensible  way that they  can get here  wormholes  but yeah  of course  a psychopath 
[01:41:30]  a psychopath  said  a known crazy  man  said the most  believable way  that you could  travel  at this speed  is if you learn  how to manipulate  magnetism  and the magnetic  poles between  each planet  if you can learn  how to manipulate  that  and be sucked  in between  the magnetism  of each planet  that you could  travel that fast  that is kind of  crazy  there are theoretical  physicists  that say that  there's a way  to make something  happen in two 
[01:42:00]  different places  at once  like you know  if you're traveling  faster than the  speed of light  Dr. Kaku and I  discuss it sometimes  in the elevator  oh really  like I'll walk in  one time I freak  because I'm a fan  of his  because I used to  hear him on Art Bell  he's a disgustingly  brilliant genius  and I saw him  and I was really  starstruck  and he was at the desk  getting ready to walk  towards the elevator  I go hi Dr. Kaku  and I started to walk  and he actually  doubled back  and almost went  to the other elevator  I creeped him out  in my own building  you know what  bothered me  about the good  doctor  because you  pointed him out  to me one day  and I was walking  home and I actually 
[01:42:30]  saw him and I  started freaking out  and I was starstruck  because I'm like  that guy is smarter  than pretty much  anyone on this planet  what is he known for  he's a theoretical  physicist  he's like  these guys are the  ones that go beyond  what physics do  and they theorize  like Stephen Hawking  he theorized about  black holes  before he had  any proof of them  he's got some shit  and there he is  on the streets  of Manhattan  taking a little  bike taxi  he was being filmed  for something though  they were filming  that's why I didn't  go over and go  and discuss him  oh by the way  I didn't see the camera  because I was just  thinking that's a little  strange  if I was that brilliant 
[01:43:00]  I don't think I would  be you know  taking bike taxi  for enjoyment  why is no one  that backs me  on this calling  I did ask  by the way  your gravity question  I confirmed with him  that I was wrong  because we control the show  oh really  you motherfucker  let somebody  we control the show  put somebody on  who backs me  asshole  you dopey  we had a guy  dopey dopey  dopey dopey  and pervy  pervy pal  let a motherfucker  who believes me  answer  listen this is what's  going to happen  seriously  in about two weeks  two weeks  we're going to do  a 9-11 show  because this is  getting old  we got to settle  it once and for all 
[01:43:30]  yes  it's Anthony  versus Patrice  Anthony gets  one or two guys  you get one or two guys  and then we'll have  at it for two hours  straight  on this fine channel  presenting facts  people are already  betting  and it'll never get old  by the way  we're still talking  about fucking JFK  oh I know  I know what you mean  but people are  betting already  and the early bets  are in for Anthony  fuck him  I'm gonna  you know what  you got nothing  I've been  leisurely into this  you son of a bitch  and I just  now you're gonna delve  now I'm gonna get  blueprints 
[01:44:00]  you know there's  nothing wrong  with everyone being  educated  and we want you  to wear a suit  that day  that's right  and we want you  to come in  with a briefcase  a shark skin suit  sky blue  as long as that  motherfucker has  the fillies on the  front  I'm gonna have a  powerpoint presentation  and you better have  some charts  charts and graphs  we want graphs  and charts  and you believe in too  that's the sad thing  you believe in the  9-11 conspiracy show  no I'm not sure  what the government knew  you're not completely 
[01:44:30]  but as far as the event  that happened on 9-11  it happened exactly  how I saw it on TV  it's pretty clean cut  what they knew  I don't know why  you're not letting  the physicists call  what Bush knew  and all that  I question a lot  of that stuff  absolutely  but that's  manipulation  but that's different  than saying the event  didn't happen  how we saw it  I didn't say the event  didn't happen  I wonder how you saw it  I just think  I do wonder  if we could have  prevented it  I wonder if we could have  I don't know  those questions man  I just  the questions that were  raised  and the fact that 
[01:45:00]  there's a couple of  non-like kooks  that are fucking saying  look there's some  credible guys  making lectures  that fucking work  at institutions  of higher knowledge  that are saying this shit  I've seen them  and I've seen the same  type of people  very intelligent  engineers  talk about how  we never landed  on the moon either  can I ask  and they're  intelligent people  some of them  like I said  engineers  the architect  of the building  said he couldn't  fall like that  oh well  but here's the 
[01:45:30]  architect  here's the other  thing  here's the other  thing  did the buildings  need to fall  for them to  accomplish  what they wanted  to accomplish  I think when  two planes  hit the  twin towers  job done  well they're saying  that Jude  they got done  exactly  but they got  they got  you know  they got  they got down  exactly what they wanted  they would have  had to demolish  why wouldn't they  just do this  let the planes  hit and then  demolish them  you'd have to  demolish them  anyway  you could stop  building up  from where  how would you 
[01:46:00]  get  no way  how'd they get  that high  anyway  you don't think  they could  build  okay ready  out of any  construction workers  who could have  if the buildings  didn't fall  could you have  a construction company  could you rebuild  where the planes  they absolutely  would have demolished  them  if those buildings  had like from  the 76th floor  up  gone  this is a  guesstimation  no it's not  because they would  have been worried  about the problem  they are smart 
[01:46:30]  people who are  doing lectures  on the lecture  circuit  soon as the  planes  they work at  institutes of  higher  as soon as the  planes hit  they did what  they had to  you know  they did what  they wanted to  do  I mean to  actually make  sure the  buildings came  down  that you know  what does that  do at that  point  hey Patrice  are you willing  to believe  that it was  regardless of  who did what  and stuff  that it was  Mohammed Atta  and terrorists  that flew into  that plane  yes but  here's why  I'm saying  yes I  believe it  to be so  but there 
[01:47:00]  are fucking  look it  I'm about  as I'm  in terms of  because I had  a follow up  in terms of  my own  like investigation  yeah  when a motherfucker  just raises a  question right  like we were  all the day  after it happened  was like  destroy  whoever you  have to destroy  you know we  just were  emotional  just to watch  that happen  but I'm saying  now it's five  years later  questions are being  raised and  and the fact  that somebody  would go  okay  some of these  guys might be  still be alive  okay some of 
[01:47:30]  them might  still be alive  it's just a  question that  you that  goes in your  head like  there's no  point for  me to  first of all  there's really  no point to be  against Bush  at this point  he's gone  in two fucking  years  he's done  there's really  no point to  ever fucking  really be on  him this hard  but I'm saying  when somebody  says that  I didn't do  my own  investigating  like damn  I thought  I saw a  motherfucker  driving a cab  that looked  just like the  18th nigga  I'm saying  that you  raise that  question  you just go  could that  shit be 
[01:48:00]  could that  shit be  true  that was  why I asked  on the air  that was why I  asked on the air  that's why I  asked on the air  what if  what if the  plane  didn't make it  what if he got  lost  got shot down  then you have  and one  one of the  buildings gets  hit let's say  one of the  world trade  center buildings  gets hit  falls down  now you got  the other one  standing there  the plane  didn't fucking  make it  got the guy  got caught at  the airport  it was shot  down by the  fucking  mill  whatever  ran out of  fucking gas  I don't know 
[01:48:30]  what would  they then do  with a world  trade center  loaded with  fucking  explosives now  what what  do they do  good question  because you do  not the fuck  do they do  because you do  know that one  was supposed to  hit either the  Capitol or the  White House  where are the  explosives that  were in there  one of the  planes almost  had a mid-air  collision too  when they were  turning around  from Boston  it was a couple  thousand feet  or two hundred  feet of hitting  another plane  and flying  so that one  wouldn't have  been the world  trade center  that's right  what happened 
[01:49:00]  Patrice is  raising his hand  where's the  explosives  here's the  possibility  just to say  open your  mind up  could be  completely  ridiculous  my mind  is like  like a  cougar  snatch  the fact  that they're  blaming  the owner  whatever  steen  okay  yeah  say  as an  insurance  thing  I think  it's a  disgrace  first of  all that  Arabs do  something  and a Jew  is taking  the blame  for it  it's a  goddamn  disgrace  I don't  know how  they spun  that  I'm just 
[01:49:30]  saying  possibly  possibly  that  in case  of this  type of  disaster  and you  needed to  bring these  buildings  down  quickly  they  built the  buildings  with  demolition  equipment  just in  case  insurance  wise  you had  to go  okay  we gotta  bring them  down  right  now  wow  get a 5XL  straight jacket  wow  get a 5XL  straight jacket 
[01:50:00]  I'm just throwing something out there  my man Patrice  I'm just throwing something out there  that they could  two words  A Cam's Razor  what  two words for you Patrice  A 5XL  A Cam's Razor  A Cam's Razor  what the fuck is that  oh my god  that's what I do now  Patrice Razor is a good point  I call  A Cam's Razor  what is that  into question  what is that  O-C  C-A-M-S 
[01:50:30]  Razor  I'm just saying  I'm just throwing out there  well  tell Patrice this  two words  A Cam's Razor  I know Professor Anthony  knows this term  but here you go  anyways  the simplest answer  is usually  the  truth  oh okay  yeah  I've heard that  but not put in those terms  alright well  we'll have a show  what is it  two hour show  you thinking  I'm thinking 10 minutes  I was just thinking  what are we going to do  with the other  hour and 55 minutes  it's going to be like 
[01:51:00]  it's going to be like  Little League  it's going to be ahead  by 20 rocks  we're going to have to  call the game  I'm just saying  that you  you gotta  you're in deep trouble  who are you bringing  to the table with you  Patrice  who the fuck knows  I never got into  any of these fucking  you have no idea  who you're dealing with  I do  I'm not afraid of this  motherfucking prayer  he knows me  every day  he knows me more and more  I read the report  I'm not scared of this  how many pages in the report  Anthony  oh my god  hundreds  there was about  hundreds  how many pages  did you read in the report  I read what somebody else read 
[01:51:30]  and repeated  copy and paste  wait a minute  you fucking read  the 9-11 report  he read the entire report  understand my context here  you went to a barber shop  and got some facts together  you're only repeating  what you're told  but you're only repeating  certain information  that you were told  I'm not going to let you  I'm not going to let you  get away with that  not only does my pal  Anthony read the report 
[01:52:00]  then he studies up on  and starts pulling out  blueprints and stuff  see now you gotta go  read the report  and now you gotta  back it up  with other sources  my pal Anthony goes  this looks interesting  but you know what  I want to find out  for myself  so I'm going to find  a blueprint of a 7-57  I'm going to the Boeing  and I'm going to see  what this piece is  and look for it  in the engine  and it matches  did you hear  what you do  did you hear about  the fact that they found  the guy's fucking  passport  okay I'm just asking  alright  who's the 
[01:52:30]  the fact that they  would say that  right  you can either  you do two things  you either  believe it  or you don't believe it  that's what I'm saying  is this is  this  these questions  are like  up for debate  now only thing  I'm saying  is that some of  these scientists  are saying  that scientifically  some of this shit  is not  is not  credible  what that report  you read  is not credible  from scientific  basis  so I'm just saying 
[01:53:00]  I couldn't believe it  you don't think  it's feasible  possible  that a guy  that is most  definitely  in the front  of the fucking plane  and all the passengers  were told to get  to the fucking  back of the plane  behind the fuel  and the guy  is in the cockpit  in the front  of the plane  as it smashes  into the building  and he is torn  to shreds  you don't think  his passport  can go flying  somewhere  and end up  on a street  somewhere  could 
[01:53:30]  are the odds  that it's gonna get  is it probable  is it  is it probable  no  it's so unlikely  that the moon  made it up  it's so unlikely  that you wouldn't  make it up  you wouldn't  you wouldn't  in an explosion  you wouldn't  leave a passport  in the street  it's improbable  and the whole  conspiracy  you're spouting  is improbable  is it impossible  it could be  improbable  you know something  they could have  put it to its foot  it's so  improbable  that you would  take the less 
[01:54:00]  improbable thing  and say  this is more probable  hey Tony  Tony can help out  Patrice  Tony and St. Louis  go ahead  yeah  what about  that $20 bill  that you folded up  and one side  was the pentagon  and the other side  was the towers  I thought that  was interesting  yeah  oh and you fold  the $20  I knew you was gonna  let that type of person  who actually did that  even Hawkins  is probably on the line  right now  you told me to help you out  I helped you out  he put  the guy  you fold up the $20  and it looks like a fire 
[01:54:30]  like the bushes  and you put it together  it looks like the world  tracing on fire  that's who he let through  he's not letting  he's not letting credible  fucking people on the line  I certainly did  I certainly did  that's why this guy  laughed at himself  I certainly did  if you also folded a certain way  you can make it a bow tie  and then you can blame  the nation of Islam  for doing it  I certainly did  the next caller  is gonna tell Patrice  that 9 plus 3  equals 12  no no no  anyway  here's a good question  that we had  but this is why  my mind 
[01:55:00]  my mind just works  crazy  it doesn't work  you're gullible  you're gullible too  you fucking piece of shit  but at least you admit you are  how would you  if you could go back in time  yeah  now we need time machines  you know that I'm just saying  you think time machines  possibly could be  we got a cabinet  we can turn that into  time travel ever  ever  by the way  you're wrong  it will be  and Dr. Kaku will explain that  it's about  if you travel fast enough  yes it is  you can go further in time  you can see  what we do  you can see into the past  when you're looking at life  when you're looking at 
[01:55:30]  the light from a star  you're seeing a million years  in the past  yeah but you're not  seeing an actual  some substance  you can touch anymore  you're seeing an image  we can't see that yet  we can't do that yet  but eventually  they do think it's possible  and this is theoretical physics  does think that's possible  it has something to do with mirrors  and you're laughing at me  and in a certain way  I thought you was being funny  I'm not stupid all the time  I thought you was being an ass  you used the mirrors  how?  no  I can't believe  that he actually just bought  I'm a good actor 
[01:56:00]  I made that up completely  if you traveled away from Earth  faster than the speed of light  as you look back on Earth  you would see time going backwards  and you also  you age differently  when you travel the speed of light  but you would see it  it's not actually happening  it's what you see  now let me ask you  if you could go  if you could go  no it did  we learned that  in Planet of the Apes  no remember  like  that's great  let me put that in my footnote  source  Planet of the Apes  no remember the scene  where like  it wasn't Charlton Heston  right  damn  they used the other guy 
[01:56:30]  and he was okay  and then he checked on  his fellow astronauts  and there was a  there was a crack  in their thing  a leak in her  she was supposed to be  our Eve  damn you  you cut out his brain  you bloody baboon  so they ended up aging  remember  yeah the one person  yeah  the one chick  she was supposed to be  the chick that was going to  bang the three guys  and make a new civilization  there you go  see  that proves it  that proves everything  you're a hypothetical thinker  right  you're a hypothetical  why only one chick  would they send them  what if she had bad genes 
[01:57:00]  and the kid came out  with Down syndrome  they're like  oh  now they're stuck on a planet  a whole planet  full of these things  no back then  they used to just send  Rock Hill Welch  ain't nothing wrong with that  it was Sophia Loren  you know Rock Hill Welch  first thing you do  is open a big hat factory  they just threw them  on a spaceship  with all that wasted headroom  or actually use  the hats that the age  were wearing  you big head  wait here's a quick question  how would you have stopped it  if you can go back in time  hypothetically 
[01:57:30]  if you go send you back in time  to 9, 10  oh wow  that's cutting it close  how could you  what would you have done  to try to stop it  if you had the knowledge  what would I have done  to stop it  to try to stop it  okay  I would have called  first of all  I would have called in  bomb threats  on all the planes  that's the first thing you do  say  there's going to be  a bomb  on  each of those planes  automatically  plane grounded  I'd give the names 
[01:58:00]  of who's going to do it  automatically grounded now  would it have been  automatically grounded then  automatically  yeah  bomb threat  they take very seriously  I'd have done that  give out the names  of the terrorists  and say that these people  you know  are planning  to blow that  and it would  mess up their whole  their whole scheme  they'd search them more  they'd look into their  background a little more  even based on like nothing  just a stupid  and go to the  statue of liberty  and scratch that  nonsense off  and it would just say  give us your white people  but we're already there 
[01:58:30]  though right  I like Timmy's idea  it's not about black people  it's  it's more about them  black people have been  upgraded to past them  we're not them anymore  you really gotta go back to the white  you fuck up yourself  you fuck ass  the last bastion  white people  I saw many people  listen  last bastion  the last bastion  it's over after us  after you is over  Dave in Jersey  Dave  I'm hearing  Dave  Dave  I think that these  conspiracy theories  are impossible  I mean 
[01:59:00]  all these firemen  are sitting there  sifting through the rubble  they don't find  any remains of any  sort of explosive devices  in the rubble  but they'll find  body parts  they'll find  computers  phones  all that kind of stuff  I mean it's impossible  to have that many people  involved in these theories  and not have one person  find something  did you see  the clip of the firemen  talking  and one dude  was like  dude  it was a bunch of explosions  and that motherfucker  came down  like a professional demolition  a fireman  said that 
[01:59:30]  what does the fireman  know about  what the fuck  did they know about  all type of shit like that  no one knows about  the world trade center  falling before it fell  no one knew about it  no one knew what it  sounded like  people heard roars  they heard friggin  freight trains  they heard explosions  you just discredit that  statement  as  ah whatever  no  he probably did hear  explosives  and he said  the way it came down  was like  what the fuck  like that shit  was not  falling  anything is going to  take the path  of least resistance 
[02:00:00]  which is straight down  on a 90 degree angle  to gravity  when can we take  that's the path  when can we take  the path  to a commercial break  we could do that  good segue  good segue  because I gotta take  a path right to the urinal  come on guys  let's lighten it up  listen fellas  I'd say that  whole break  I just was excited  about all the new emails  I got from my secret friends  who won't call in  they're using their  goddamn negro  guinea pig  to spew out the nonsense  white people really do know 
[02:00:30]  how to use black people  for their own goddamn  ill-gotten games  you bastards  where are you  did you see a picture  of the guy  who's the head  of this thing  this ass  he wears a shirt  that says  9-11 conspiracy  he's a 22 year old  boob  yeah but I'm not  with it  I'm not with it  I've left loose canes  boy  I've left loose canes  but Trace  this guy Jerome  wants to help you out  Jerome  here we go  what's going on fellas  hey Jerome  alright  I'm not going to  say anything new  I mean I know  just as much 
[02:01:00]  as all you guys  why are you calling  I'm a physicist  I want to try  to help out  ah a physicist  then where do you  physicist  sounds like  we're physicists  from Brooklyn Tech  yeah  hey there you're  fucking  E equals MC  fucking square  I made a mistake  I'm a pharmacist  fuck it  I'm out  I teach physicist ed  at the high school  alright physicist  where did you go  to your physicist school  well now  now it's probably  going to get worse  more jokes 
[02:01:30]  small school  out of  out of Boston  call Curry College  call what  I know Curry  it's on  it's in Milton  MIT a little too  expensive  or the grades  weren't that good  no no Curry College  is the division 12  of physicists  they actually spell  physics with an F  if they played Duke  they played Duke  in the national  physicists  they wouldn't lose  Jesus  they didn't have  any scouts  in there  no there's no  there weren't any 
[02:02:00]  scouts checking him  out in high school  the head coach  is also  the motherfucker  that cooks  he's the cook  and the head coach  over the front door  it says if man  were meant to fly  he'd have wings  oops  Curry College  that's what they  that's what you  that's what they  they're professional  in Curry  they cook chicken  goat  you go there  and eat  the physics  of Indian cooking  this nigga  from Curry College  calls me  to back there 
[02:02:30]  with the Curry  fucking college  sir what did you  learn there  that will help  out this conversation  empathy  that's tough  I mean  oh Anthony  I gotta leave it  all up to you  though  with all your  arguments  I mean that's  all that we  we studied  you know  how things move  in space  and exactly  the points  that are made  with this  with the  commission report  you're the dumbest  physicist I've ever  heard in my life  wait a minute  wait a minute  give him a break  too  your boy 
[02:03:00]  is socially  inept too  people are really  smart  are not good  socialists  give him a chance  first of all  he's on the  fucking radio  first time  in his life  let him  let him  get it out  sir explain  inertia  get right  to the point  let's see  if he's a physicist  explain inertia  oh  oh that's good  you have a body  an object  that's moving  there could be  something inside  of it  and if it turns  left  that thing  can turn  left too  no  somebody  call  is that  correct  I don't  know  what it means  he don't even  know  I know  he wouldn't  even know  that  the law  of inertia  is easy  an object 
[02:03:30]  at rest  will remain  at rest  unless  it is  influenced  by an outside  source  and an object  in motion  will remain  in motion  unless  influenced  I don't know  who to believe  curry college  here's what it is  or  new professor  ex  air conditioning  man  new professor  now  fuck both  for y'all  I don't believe  in either  one  inertia  is  this is  the name  of my  daughter  no  inertia  it's where  your dick 
[02:04:00]  is when  you fuck  ursha  alright  karnak  good one  inertia  Jimmy held  a little envelope  up to his  turban  inertia  inertia  let me  close the envelope  open  there's dew  on your  dippity  two words  may inertia  rob your 
[02:04:30]  house  tonight  two words  yes  shroddinger's  cat  end of  discussion  is that  someone else  fucking with you  I don't know  shroddinger's cat  is the  of course  the law  of physics  that says  alright  Jerome  anything else  well I want to  try to help out  Patrice  I want him to  say what  what's something  an argument  what's an argument  that he can't  explain himself 
[02:05:00]  it's the whole  the scientific fact  of how the  buildings fell  how fast they fell  the thing I was  watching  the guy said  if you drop an egg  from the top  of the building  it would take  eight seconds  to fall  but that's  with no resistance  and the buildings  fell in eight  seconds  nine seconds  with resistance  who is timing  the buildings  falling  it's probably  fucking on film  you can watch it  they just time it  is he trying to  help me  but still  like it's  I mean  that's something  that's not 
[02:05:30]  possible either  can we at least  get a guy  from paprika  college  I know  they're a step  up  I need some  all spice  college graduates  how about  Mrs. Dash  University  motherfucker  this nigga  called from  I'm telling you  Curry College  is a college  that's on the way  to another college  when you're driving  you go  that's Curry College  I'm on the way  to another one  it's the dumbest  college ever  it's one building  physics community college  god damn it 
[02:06:00]  physics community college  oh god  that's motherfucking  wicked shit  that dummy  I would rather hear  Big A read  out of a physics book  of course  let's go to Dave  in North Carolina  Dave's gonna back up  Patrice  hey  hey  I've been in  countries where  they do rig  buildings and  bridges with bombs  and also I want to  ask you  have you ever seen  a fire burn  downwards  a fire burn 
[02:06:30]  downwards  yes  yes  and it would  make so much  sense to drop  a building  that's a lost  cause  anyways  a what  it would make  so much sense  to drop a building  that's a lost  cause anyways  they can't put  the fire out  they can't pull  the plane out  you know  it would make  more sense  to drop the  building  yes so  they had it  rigged just in  case  I got you  just in case  planes had it  rigged  but I mean  I've been places  where they do  rig things like  that 
[02:07:00]  and I mean  it's easy to say  they can just  run in there  and push the C4  and drop it  thank you very much  that's Patrice's  constituency  there he is  that's my esteemed  colleague  you might be right  if you rig a  building  you know  you ever seen  fire burn down  yes I have  you might be  whenever someone  starts  I've been in  countries  you might be  redneck  this is awful 
[02:07:30]  I'm just gonna  start to say  if you ever  studied physics  at Curry College  you might be  you might be  an idiot  see the chemistry  between us  we finish each  other's sentences  sometimes  another minute  and that guy  would have said  did you notice  there were no  yarmulkes burned  that's another thing  some of the shit  it's like  what you decide  that you're gonna  it's like  I go  when people go  there was no Jews  they were told  they were told  the day before  to take the day off  Patrice  we got other  things to do  on the show  today  so here's the deal 
[02:08:00]  this is what I say  to you  well first of all  you're gonna be on the  radio Saturday night  doing your relationship  show  which is unbelievable  if you haven't heard  Patrice doing his  relationship show  which by the way  I just wouldn't even  try to challenge you  in that whole  fucking realm  that's where you're  an expert my friend  I've seen guys  rattle off questions  to Patrice  off the top of their head  some obscure  relationship question  and without blinking  an eye  or taking a second  to think about it  his computer like  relationship head  spits an answer out 
[02:08:30]  you like  in a second  it's like  oh  what are you talking about  you do blah blah blah  blah blah  and the guy's like  like fascinated  like he just climbed  the mountain  and Buddha was sitting  up there  and he got an answer  from him  he's heading toward  a weekly show  with that  because it's that strong  so it's going to be  on Saturday night  8 o'clock we decide  8 to 10  and this is what  I say to you Patrice  if you get a team  behind you  we'll do a 9-11 show  we'll do a 9-11 show  I'm on it right now  couple of weeks  we'll get on the air  and do it with some 
[02:09:00]  proof  and all of our little  shit  and we'll encourage  everybody to call  people that agree  with you  and people that agree  with Anthony  and we'll do it  the right way  once and for all  fair enough  we're going to go to break  with Patrice O'Neill  a little bit  maybe it's cold  outside  we took one of  Patrice's stories  and we  we put it to music  there's a guy  looking in the window  clean cut 
[02:09:30]  white guy  amber crombie and fish  what's up man  he goes  it's cold out here  I go  I go  what  it's cold out here  and he tries my handle  on my door  he pulls my door handle  holy shit  it's cold out here  we'll go inside  there you go  we'll go inside  there's coffee in there  now I'm sitting there  not thinking anything  except for this  some crazy motherfucker

[02:12:30]  special  featuring  comedian  and host  of VH1's  web junk  20  Petrice O'Neill  Saturday  April  22nd  from 8pm  to 10pm  only on  XM202  a happy  woman  is a  miserable  man  but women  don't even  know how  they want  to be  treated  hey  you're crazy  bitch  but you're  fuck so  good  I'm on top  of it  when I dream  I'm doing  you all night  stack yourself  down my back  to keep  me right on  hey  you're crazy  bitch  but you're  fuck so  good  I'm on top  of it  when I dream  I'm doing  you all night 
[02:13:00]  stack yourself  down my back  to keep  me right on  yeah we still  gotta do a show  that's Buck  Cherry  you're checking  out the ONA  program  Patrice O'Neill  in studio  he's gonna be  here all day  tomorrow  because  little Jimmy  Norton's  playing some  shows in  Chicago  Chicago  as Keith  would say  you're gonna  leave in what  a half hour  no actually  stay until  11 my  flight's  later  hey my  flight's  a little  later  so I'm  gonna hang  out a little  bit longer  on the  program 
[02:13:30]  you want me  to shout  it all over  this fucking  airport  hey we got  Henry Rollins  coming in  too  yeah  could be  interesting  we've had  Henry on  a couple  of times  we argued  with him  on the phone  last time  yeah what was  it about  he was like  he was talking  down to us  about Richard  Pryor  he tried to  and Jimmy  smashed him  pretty good  yeah  we were just  talking  he's a spoken  word  and I'm like  why don't  you just  do stand-up  because he's  there's like  jokes in there  and he's like  what so I can  write a  and he did 
[02:14:00]  some smart  like remarkable  I could do it  so I can write  like a chick joke  or something  like that  like all comics  just do that  and then Jimmy  got up and  punched him  so hard  in the face  through the phone  that Henry  fell down  I said  oh yeah  I guess  that's what  comedians do  like Richard Pryor  and we just  got into an  argument  he's like  why haven't  listened to Pryor  since you guys  were 12  and then he  just named  prior albums  wrong  hey  want a little  trivia  about Henry  Rollins  and my  illustrious  radio career  maybe Opie  can  maybe Opie  remembers this  Henry Rollins 
[02:14:30]  has something  that was a  milestone  in my  radio career  do you  remember  what it  was  wow  and I'm  pretty good  at this  stuff  give me  like a  slight hint  it was at  WAAF  I know  what it was  no you don't  I do  actually  you told me  shut your  face  you told me  no I haven't  because I  just remembered  I would say  it would be  the first  person you  interviewed  on the  radio  but that's  the  no  but you're  in the  right  ballpark  Fenway 
[02:15:00]  the first  celebrity  you star  fucked  no  the most  famous guy  to ever  rape you  on the  console  Jimmy  Norton  gets the  point  what the  hell is  it  you don't  remember  let's see  looking  let me look  at instant  feedback  I'll refresh  the page  if somebody  has it  I will  no  it's a  milestone  in your  radio career  Henry  Rollins  kind of a  milestone  in my 
[02:15:30]  career  my radio  career  you didn't  warm up  for Black  Flag or  something  nope  when you were  doing your  band thing  this was  the first  interview  I ever  did  solo  because I  was doing  the show  alone  because you  were home  sick  I actually  did the  show by  myself  holy shit  I remember  that  remember that  I did the  show by  myself  yeah  it was me  and Henry  Rollins  in the  studio  I do 
[02:16:00]  remember  that  I had been  doing radio  for no  time  and I'm  sitting there  alone  trying to  work the  buttons  because  god forbid  they had  someone  give me a  fucking  board op  back then  cheap  AAF  actually it  went really  well  the interview  went great  it went  good  I do  remember  it went  well  and we  played music  it wasn't  a talk  show  his sickness  got better  in the  snake  no because  you know  something  it was  I'm fine  as far as  as far as  playing music  because we  played a lot  of music 
[02:16:30]  back then  and it  was just  make sure  when the  CD counts  down  make sure  you have  the next  one in  there  it's pretty  much  easy to  do  and then  Henry Rollins  came in  had a  good interview  with him  I thought  it went  well  but in  between  like when  I had to  front sell  or back  sell a  song  what the  fuck  do I  know  hey  that was  Pearl  Jam  know what  sucks  no one  gave a shit  about us  back then  so there's  no tape  no  no tape  no  every word  we say  is recorded 
[02:17:00]  passed around  the world  placed in  shrines  good point  Nixon  why I  don't know  but  yeah every  show  every word  from a show  can be found  somewhere  I guarantee  there's no  tape of that  no  that was  that was  my first  solo  flying solo  well Henry  Rollins will be  here at 10 a.m.  he's got a new  show on  IFC I believe  right he's doing 
[02:17:30]  a talk show  over there  yeah he does  like  reviews  movie reviews  and interviews  I saw  it used to be  movie reviews  and now they  expanded his  role  he's doing  some talk  stuff over  there for  that  cool  well there's  a bunch of  things we  could do  we got  Patrice O'Neill  in studio  we got  worst stutterer  ever  we have a  story coming  out of  Minnesota  looks like  man busted  for jacking  it  we might need  Steve for  that  why  he was  in the  urinal  next to  him  guy 
[02:18:00]  needed  something  to  jack  to  I like  this  country  music  idea  I never  did  you want  to try  the  country  music  idea  we had  a lot  of fun  with this  yeah let's  do that  with Patrice  when you were  in Hollywood  there  also we have  a peek  at another  sitcom  called  Teachers  that's a lot  of fun  usually too  yeah  Dan put  that together  yes  of course  he did  yes  wonderful  you want to  do the  country  music  thing  I'd like  to try  it  every once  in a while  we look  at the  top  country  songs  in  America 
[02:18:30]  now  we're  not too  up to date  on  the country  I'm looking  at the  top  ten  country  songs  in  America  and the  truckers  are going  to be  very  disappointed  in us  I  don't  recognize  one of  them  I recognize  some of  the artists  some of  the names  I haven't  heard any  of these  songs  they don't  recognize  it  won't  give them  away  though  because  what we  try to  do  is  we  read  the  song  title  and  then  we  try  to  figure  out  what  the  country  song 
[02:19:00]  is  about  that's  it  oh I like  that  yeah well  this one's  easy  which one  number  ten  all right  number  ten  so you  want to  just  get into  this  a little  bit  yeah  we don't  have to  play  all  ten  we'll  look  at  some  of  the  titles  of  the  top  ten  country  songs  in  America  and see  which  ones  we  want to  go  with  okay  yeah  so  number  ten  is  Leanne  rhymes  something's  gotta  give  something's  gotta  give  this  has  to  be  she's  in a  relationship  it's  bad  something's 
[02:19:30]  gotta  give  either  she's  this  guy's  gotta  straighten  up  his  shit  or  she's  fucking  leaving  patrice  and this  is  where  i  respect  patrice  very  much  because  he  can  usually  figure  this  shit  out  and if  you  tie  9-11  into  this  i just  don't  want to  think  to be  everybody  that i'm  always  against  my  friend  anthony  right  just  9-11  thing  now  something's  gotta  give  i would  say  that  this  chick  is  trying  to  be  very  somebody  gave 
[02:20:00]  her  some  advice  to be  very  in tune  with  her  audience  and i  think  something's  been  going  bad  and  it's  gotta  pick  up  really  yes  i disagree  like in  her life  in her  life  can i  go  all right  i think  the star  of this  song is  just  constipated  anything  it's  like she's  gotta take  a really  bad  dump  how much  money  would that  make  though  if this 
[02:20:30]  was  a sexy  bitch  going  something's  gotta  give  something  gotta  give  i think  just like  the staff  of the  opium  anthony  program  the star  of this  song  eats  a lot  of  egg whites  and  something's  gotta  give  yeah  the oxy  powders  jimmy any  ideas  liang rhymes  something's  gotta  give  i think  she's  being  fucked  by a  fat  man  on a  little  flimsy  wooden  bed  a little  futon  so  it's 
[02:21:00]  referring  to  the  bed  that  the  bed's  gonna  give  her  back  with  a  bed  one  gonna  break  her  hips  on a  bed  something's  gotta  give  so  keep  pumping  fat  boy  yeah  it's  a  cougar  getting  fucked  old  graham  cracker  hip  well let's  go to  kelly  in wisconsin  we'll let  the listeners  play a little  bit  kelly  kelly  you've  never  heard  this  song  before  right  i've  never  heard  that  song  before  and  just  let  you  know  i'm  a  truck  driver  hold  hold 
[02:21:30]  on  kelly  his name  kelly  why  i  i  think  this  song  is  basically  he doesn't  get it  because it's  normal to him  now  do you spell  it with an  eye  with a little  heart over  the eye  no  why  kelly  why  why did  your parents  call you  kelly  you know  i don't  know  i know  there was  uh  there's some  like men  that are  named  kelly  yeah  i was thinking  bad news  bears  kelly  kelly  leek  leek  or something  like that  yeah  he wasn't  exactly 
[02:22:00]  the most  if you're  looking for  the most  badass  i don't think  you got it  opie  little kelly  leek  he was badass  on the air  hockey table  but  he really wasn't  a badass  in that movie  was he  tatum o'neill  smashed him  in air hockey  yeah  he sucked  kelly  van dam  kelly  van dam  wham  bam  van dam  you guys  rock  we know  kelly  my name is  kelly  i'm from  wisconsin  kelly  what's the song 
[02:22:30]  about  kelly  saunders  i think  it's about  a virgin  who just  can't find  a guy  with a big  enough dick  to break  it  because he's  waiting to  break that  hymen  so the  something is  the hymen  something's got  to give  alright  alright  that's close  you know how much  money she would  make if she  could be smart  enough to make  a disgusting  song like  she's constipated  leanne rhymes  has enough  money  alright  why don't we  try to  why don't we  find out what  something's got  to give 
[02:23:00]  is all about  see this reminded  me of another  song called  someone's got  to give  it was about  trying to  collect for a  charity at a  bar mitzvah  holy crap  let's listen to a  piece of  something's got  to give  leanne rhymes  the harder  beginning  states  this is hot  country  some kind of  is this michael  jackson's first  song  Indian shit  what's this  george harrison  bangladesh  that's groaning

[02:39:30]  like he's like  she's like  you know  I'm the lucky one  because you know  you're a great guy  she's just some  dumb guy who thinks  this is a  this is a reverse  psychology arrogance  to say that  you may think that  I'm the lucky  that you're the lucky one  because I'm such a hot bitch  but I'm the lucky one  let's go  let's say hi to Vinny in Vegas  that's good  Vinny  hey  how y'all doing  what's up Vinny  hey I just want to say  you know  I take a little bit of offense  to what you guys are saying  because you know  I drive for a living  and I don't drive  you know

[03:13:00]  week on the  independent film channel  yeah i have a  meager half hours  yeah henry rollins  show i think it's  actually 25 minute  show so it's less  than half an hour  that's a great game  but uh  25 minutes i would  love they gave me uh  this is the second  season so i'm doing  something right uh  for now uh so  yeah it's a good show  we have musical guests  on and uh  interesting guests  just to talk  well people i find  interesting hopefully  yeah  i actually watched uh  part of the episode  of the game yesterday  it was uh  a great interview with  ozzy  oh yeah  it had a cool feel to 
[03:13:30]  it was like almost  like you were hanging  out in someone's  basement you don't  feel like you're  watching like a  typical uh  talk show and uh  it was really  interesting  yeah i've interviewed  ozzy a bunch of  times you know  i've worked on some  of his video press  kits and i've  toured with him and  he's a great guy and  that was probably our  best interview we've  ever done together  he's a good guy i  mean yeah we've  had him in here  everyone likes  he was great for us  man yeah  who doesn't like  ozzy yeah everyone  likes like no one  that goes ozzy's a  dick yeah  you never hear stuff  like that but you  don't think black  sabbath was the  greatest band ever  right me yeah 
[03:14:00]  yeah i'm one of  those people yeah  wow look at that  jimmy norton does  too jimmy is the  hugest black  yeah not everyone's  cup of tea but you  know considering what  they were doing when  they were doing it  they kind of came out  of this musical vacuum  and they kind of were  the cornerstone of a  genre and so like  them or not you have  to give them props for  at least being  innovators and for  that you know and  besides that i like the  records that's what i've  been saying and like a  guy like santana who  stole from rat salad  off of uh paranoid  nobody believes me but  i'm telling you know  sabbath were innovators 
[03:14:30]  but yeah and they were  and uh and uh but  carlos santana and his  band fantastic  all right listen jimmy's  sounding smart and  stuff but you two  sunday bloody sunday  he he thinks was ripped  off from black sabbath's  sunday title was  sabbath bloody  sabbath bloody  sabbath right  right and that's a  stretch though it's a  bit bit of a stretch  thank you thank you  mr ron it is  thank you henry's  being polite because  he probably is friends  with bono they hang  out and pull trains  together he's a nice  dude uh never  i don't think they  would happen i don't 
[03:15:00]  think that's gonna  happen i don't think  that's gonna happen  i don't think they're  pulling trains like  with what our teeth  i don't think uh yeah  they're hanging  that's not hey what  happened to your arm  who did you oh i uh i  fell magnificently in  front of a bunch of  people in front of a  supermarket the other  day in new york that's  just like you know i  tripped and i'm a  klutz and so i i cranked  my wrist so there's no  real good story that's  no sir i just that's a  good story for whoever  saw it because seeing  anyone fall is funny  seeing someone fall and  going fucking henry  rollins well that's  that's what happened i  got up and a few people  went hey are you okay i

[03:20:30]  and i'm 45 so i i just figure if i keep  lifting like that i'm gonna blow it one  day and be hobbled because you know  you don't get your hips back you don't  get your knees back so uh yeah i look  different just slowing it down a little  bit well i'd rather be training when  i'm 65 instead of being that guy who  can't lift his arm over his shoulder  because of rotator cuff damage so guys  like me and henry who work out i prefer  to do like the bike  the bike i get on the exercise bike and i  listen to my ipod jimmy's getting in  shape trying to jimmy  he's in shape already though 
[03:21:00]  do you have no idea does anyone ever  put you put you in the spotlight and  kind of highlight you i mean get into  your life and stuff like you oh yeah  no you have no idea really just we  don't have a show without jimmy norton's  stories did you live alone oh yeah  you got oh you know why don't you give  him a story jimmy just jimmy please i  live alone yeah i have a nice place i  live alone sorry i have a nice apartment  jimmy likes some unusual things yeah yeah  well it's up to him what falls out jimmy 
[03:21:30]  what falls out of your computer they  consider uh well it's actually what  leaks out of it um they consider golden  showers to be bizarre right some people  would a lot of people would you can't  come on you're you're like a rock star  man you gotta well um some people would  find urinating on someone else a bit  much yeah well he doesn't urinate on  somebody else no it's uh he likes women  to come in wow and drink a few perriers  and yes yeah yeah well you know jimmy 
[03:22:00]  this is manhattan new york in 2006 i  guess you can just you know get your  kicks absolutely absolutely ah there's no  guessing as long as there's no dogs or no  kids i think we're all good yeah go yeah  really good movie no big play like like  the suit the side bad guy really i i'm  desperate for movie work i take whatever  i can do no no there was one you played it  was a big one and you play like the side  bad guy you didn't all much but you was in a  lot that movie oh yeah it was kind of a  a small bad guy that's right he was that's 
[03:22:30]  right you never seen fucking heat you said  it was a good film and it was fun to you  know fun to do scenes with al pacino that  was fun nice guy that's right you get to do  de niro scenes or just put you know i  never met de niro he wasn't on the set a  day i was there but i i did scenes a few  days of al pacino and it is it's cool when  a guy you you admire so much that is cool  because you know we all grew up watching  scarface godfather dog dance you know all  those movies and so if the guy's going to  be a jerk it's going to be kind of  heartbreaking because you have to take back  all your your well in those days laser 
[03:23:00]  discs but he he's actually a really cool  guy he's cool to everyone on the set he's  very classy guy and i've found i mean you  all meet famous people all the time but i  found like the bigger more famous people i  guess they don't have anything to prove  like your ozzy osborne's they're often  disarmingly cool we meet the person kind  of on their way up and they kind of blow  you off yeah a little too hip to hang  around listen to too many other people  who are waiting like right on the wings  someone tell you not to say this and at  this point you know i guess as i got this 
[03:23:30]  show i'm interviewing famous people or  whatever so it's interesting to see how  these people carry themselves i got a  question where do you have to deal with  the publicist yes yeah yeah yeah we  interview in first we interview famous  people all the time and every once in  a while you get someone to sit in that  seat and then a wall of publicists yeah  and they're shaking their head like a  head and oh you can't ask them that we  know the guy that wouldn't mind you're  not asking these scandalous questions  yeah you know is it but you know the  guy or girl that's in there would love  to just talk man just we're sitting and 
[03:24:00]  talking we've had guests dragged out  carmen electra was dragged out of our  studio would be and i don't remember  saying something they didn't want her to  say god i hung out with her i thought  she was really cool yeah we liked her a  nice publicist don't confuse us we liked  her a lot it was the publicist you know  that are what way involved in her career i  don't remember what we were talking  about and they literally maybe she's a  little too raw for them or something i  mean because she'll say what's on her  fine because they try to i guess a lot of  these people try to mold uh an image out 
[03:24:30]  of these celebrities and or just make  them like safe for prime time yeah yeah  i don't want some new thinking that  getting a real americans don't say this  word that word think about all these  things so they give them the sanitized  version and it becomes completely  unbelievable immediately you know like  where you're like oh come on man i'm not  stupid so yeah i i see how that would  offend but no i i've interviewed a lot of  famous people on the show so far and  ever so far it's been great we've not  had one jerk in there the only thing 
[03:25:00]  that's been interesting is well we've  had women uh penelope cruz was a guest  uh daryl hannah were guests and they're  both wonderful but they're very nervous  to meet me and you know they're like  like uh i don't like you know i i don't  want anyone nervous to meet me that's  that's that's at any rate people are you  mature now like yeah like you sound like  a dude that like has some type of  religious thing going no sir not at all  like you don't sound like a fucking ex  goddamn rocker at all yeah you're  surprised that people are nervous to meet  you well no no no no i i i just don't 
[03:25:30]  think if you're gonna be a host of a show  that you would want to put a guest in  an environment uncomfortable where they're  uncomfortable that's what the fuck i tell  you two motherfuckers all the time the  environment uncomfortable i mean you're  having a good time see thank you it  would be a drag if i walked in there and  there and you guys said oh hey bitch sit  the fuck down so what what's on him  rollins you know i know well i'm the  why are you surprised that people are  uncomfortable to meet you i don't know  but but i i got that look like i don't  snap at any second i don't want them to 
[03:26:00]  feel that way because how good is the  interview gonna be if the guy's like ah and  you got real tattoos do like you you're  you have the real like you know you have  the lots of people have tattoos no no no but  you have like your shit is like that's  all right before shit was really like  these motherfuckers with this mother  got like fucked up tattoos that's old  school ink that's old school ink yeah  really like you know like a lot of  pretty colors yes there's too many  pretty colors in tattoos these days  all you know what i mean like 25 years  old they all look like sailor tattoos 
[03:26:30]  some of those were done with a big pen  yes do you have an animal do i have an  animal no was you ever a animal oh my  god yeah was i ever an animal yeah i'm  like what of you from television but i'm  hitting people come on man stop trying  to no no no no no no no no no no no  like a fucking like like not an asshole  no no no i'm asking you was you fucking  like okay was you fucking five girls at  a time was you knocking motherfuckers  out was you smoking okay all type of  foul shit never never did the drugs and 
[03:27:00]  drink been drunk like three times in my  life when i was 17 just never dug it  smoke pot once didn't like it tried lsd a  few times interesting don't want to make a  a habit of that uh women more than one  at a time no been with women yes many  times lucky me what was your vice was a  big vice vice yeah we're gonna have an  artistic outlet man come on we'll get you  off uh getting on a stage and jamming  yeah i i well i i played music all the  time i i've averaged over 100 shows a 
[03:27:30]  year for 25 years so and doing that being  kind of trying to be performance grade all  the time it keeps me more in the gym than  anything else and watching my diet getting  ready for a tour and so i've kind of had  this life like kind of like a show dog or a  thoroughbred horse like you're running on  the track you put it up you comb it down  you throw the blanket over it and you see it  the next day and so i've lived more like  that which i know is kind of lightweight so  yeah i've gotten in a lot of fights never hit a  woman but i've gotten a lot of fights with  men lost someone some did a lot of damage 
[03:28:00]  to some guys faces broken more noses than  i can remember quite not you know and i'm  not i'm not a tough guy i'm not trying to  say i'm the man i'm just saying but yeah  yeah i've mixed it up and i've gotten my  ass kicked a lot we had a lot of guys  coming up especially you know back a few  years ago that just wanted to you know be  able to tell their friends that they hey  look i punched henry robin there was a lot  of that and it was a drag because all i  wanted to do is get up there and sing the  damn song we had the guy swinging your  head or the guy in angel dust you know  like holding you down and punching your  lights out so i did all that and but no i 
[03:28:30]  never did the five girls at once no i  never like you know through the thing out  the window and i don't think any longer  i'm not i'm kind of just boring in that  way what do you think of um what do you  think of uh 9-11 you think it's  conspiracy or oh boy no um i i saw that  loose change documentary which is  interesting on that lately well it raises  an interesting point of view but i just i  think the human nature it a lot of  people would have to be keeping a huge  secret i just don't think in this day  and age of opportunities for book deals  and miniseries that somebody in a 
[03:29:00]  capitalist society would go like mom is  the word and i'm partially responsible  for 3 000 people getting killed for no  good reason right so the conspiracy  theory while it that loose change  documentary does raise some interesting  points that that make you think at least  no i do not think it was a conspiracy i  don't think the pentagon wanted to have  al-qaeda fly planes into the twin towers i  do think that from uh reagan bush one  clinton bush two i don't think we get 
[03:29:30]  those presidents gave enough attention to  afghanistan al-qaeda and the taliban there  you and i'm i'm just saying because i've read  the cia books by cia people saying like  guys like robert bear who are really  interesting who are there on the ground in  these places for two decades who said you  guys you you don't want to pull us out of  afghanistan we use a thing called al-qaeda  don't take your eye off man fuck henry  rollins no  because he does the reading thing patrice  it's all about we call him copy and paste 
[03:30:00]  oh you ain't shit  your ghetto name is copy and paste  man he reads some where's the lead singer  from he looks at the loose change thing  that's been packaged as look at this  conspiracy  where's the nigga from acdc i want to talk to  that motherfucker it is interesting god might  agree i i still didn't make you think that  everything a bunch of people lied about  getting killed and whatever explosives were  planted in buildings where people are  working on a daily basis that would be a  little rough it stretches it does stretch 
[03:30:30]  it just a tad just a little bit but the  important thing i want to ask you too it's  it's about your show yes do you have  comedians on uh not yet although i'd like  to you know the the second season we've  done like it's been on three weeks so we  got a long way to go we got twenty shows  in the season so if i could have a guy  like uh patten oswald on  who i think is a funny dude i'd like to  have him on the show why don't you just  spit on me  i like patten well he's funny what y'all
