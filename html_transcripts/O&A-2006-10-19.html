<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous virus metaphor before transitioning into typical comedic fare, including fart jokes.  James Norton was present in the studio. A significant portion focused on the Mets game, its late start affecting listeners, and a possible Game 7 invitation from their boss, Joel Highlander.  The hosts bragged about their high radio ratings in various cities, contrasting their success with the Boston show "Mantown." The conversation then shifted to the shooting of rapper Fabulous,  connecting it to Sebastian Telfair and a medallion theft, with the hosts employing offensive language and racial slurs.

A large segment was dedicated to the "Fatty Pig Fatty Contest," soliciting callers to provide contestants, with one promising a 690-pound woman.  The discussion involved vulgar language and offensive jokes about logistics and handling such a large person.  The show also promoted their upcoming Halloween party and *Saw 3*, briefly mentioned Jerry Springer and a disturbing news story about a mentally handicapped man, and discussed Barack Obama's potential presidential candidacy using racially charged humor.  Bob Saget's television ratings were also briefly mentioned, concluding the initial segment.

The broadcast continued with a substantial focus on Bob Saget's new game show, "1 vs. 100," its high ratings, and a comparison of his on-air and off-air personas.  The hosts joked about Saget's language on the show and discussed memorable contestants, including one with a voice box. Barbara from Cleveland called in expressing interest in the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, leading to more crude jokes about obesity.  The HBO Comedy Festival, featuring Saget and Jim Norton, and the documentary "The Bridge" were discussed, with the director slated to appear the next day.  A call from Louis C.K. ensued, along with further discussion about Saget's show and "The Honeymooners." The hosts touched on influencing Jerry Springer's participation in "Dancing with the Stars" and their feud with a Chicago Sun-Times columnist.  Further promotion of Saget's show, along with mentions of Otto, George, and Nina Hartley (with hints of salacious stories), concluded this segment.

The show then tackled Paul McCartney and Heather Mills's contentious divorce, mocking Mills's allegations of domestic abuse and making offensive jokes about her prosthetic leg.  Audio clips from news reports were played, highlighting the graphic nature of the claims.  Crude humor and speculation about the divorce's financial aspects followed. A phone call with Jerry Springer, participating in *Dancing with the Stars*, revealed Opie and Anthony's campaign to keep him on the show, much to his frustration. Springer complained about unfair voting and the grueling schedule. A news story about a man in New Orleans who murdered and dismembered his girlfriend before committing suicide was discussed with dark humor and graphic descriptions.  The segment ended with comedic anecdotes from their studio move to XM, including interactions with a homeless woman and a man collecting cans, along with mentions of Louis C.K., Otto, and George as guests at upcoming live events and a talent contest.

A heavily damaged car arriving at the studio prompted jokes about its condition and the cab driver, Andrew, followed by a discussion about the racial demographics of Andrew's clientele.  The broadcast transitioned to technical difficulties, malfunctioning equipment, and non-functional guest mics, interspersed with crude jokes and sexual innuendo.  The hosts discussed a dentist with large breasts, teeth whitening, and inappropriate on-air comments, referencing a "dump report" filled with sexually explicit language, including phrases like "may I blow your dad," "piss my pants," and variations of "cunt." Phone sex experiences, including one host receiving news of a friend's suicide during a phone sex call, and other vulgar jokes were shared.  Louis C.K., Otto, and George were in the studio, along with a phone call from Lady Di, which detailed her struggles with homelessness, alcoholism, and a man's suicide, with the hosts using insensitive language during the questioning.  A news report about a naked, drunk woman causing a fatal accident and another about the brutal sexual assault of a developmentally disabled man were discussed with offensive jokes and comments.  A stingray attack story and technical difficulties were also briefly mentioned before closing advertisements and promotional announcements.

A segment centered around graphic online videos, including beheadings, animal abuse, and extreme pornography, with the hosts and callers sharing their experiences and reactions.  A caller detailed his experience with an escort service, leading to a discussion on the price of sex.  Trisha, a 420-pound truck driver, called to discuss a weight-gain contest.  A perceived terror threat at NFL stadiums was also mentioned.  A lengthy, humorous call with Patty, a 51-year-old virgin Starbucks employee, ensued, where the hosts presented her with pornography magazines.  The segment featured extensive vulgar language, graphic violence and sexuality, and taboo subjects.  A voicemail from Jimmy Nortonâ€™s mother, advising him to exercise, was played.

The final segment focused on a female caller, "Patty," and the hosts' crude pressure for her to engage sexually with a man who gives out complimentary casino tickets.  The conversation involved sexually explicit jokes and comments, focusing on Patty's perceived lack of sexual experience.  Patty's past experiences, including graphic details of sexual acts with show hosts and others, were discussed.  The "Line of the Day" contest, featuring dark humor and sexually explicit themes, was announced and judged.  Louie CK was a guest.  The segment ended with Patty continuing sexually explicit statements at the hosts' prompting.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  It was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ.  Five hours?  It infects, replicates and kills this fast.  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one. 
[00:00:30]  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  We better stop this outbreak before it mutates us.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is this frantic?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a little dirty. 
[00:01:00]  Wipe me.  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Very dramatic opening for a silly show, isn't it?  Very dramatic.  Very dramatic opening.  Dramatic opening, followed by fart jokes.  Silliness.  Followed by a lot of silliness.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Morning.  It's a virus.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  That's what it does.  Some of the buttons are out of place today.  They're trying to figure it out.  Out of whack? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I sound really, really loud in my headphones.  I don't know.  I guess they'll figure it out during the break.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Feel free to call.  We're taking your calls.  Everyone very, very tired in New York.  Ooh.  Because of the Mets, right?  Yeah, I think the whole city stayed up last night to watch the Mets. 
[00:02:30]  Not me.  Not me either.  Not me.  And I'm a Mets fan.  I just can't do it.  I just can't do it.  Why when all you got to do is flip on the news in the morning?  You'll know in a second.  Ah, it's not the same.  Eh.  Ah, how much worse is it, though?  You just picture it in your head.  The big plays.  So you're not sitting through those innings when nothing happens.  See, you can't understand because your team's not in it.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:03:00]  But it's like I go to bed early, 9.30, and I'm taking a peek at the Mets game, and I'm  like, oh, I'd love to watch the whole game.  You know, just do the hang.  Like a real person.  Take it all in.  Then I go to bed wondering, and then I wake up, and I turn on the TV.  First thing they say is Mets win, so you're kind of right, I guess.  That's pretty much it.  They win.  They show the highlights of how they won.  Yeah.  You know, they show how each team scored, and they show how your team scored a little 
[00:03:30]  more than the other team, and you won.  Yeah.  And then you figure, you know, you could have used that time to learn French or something.  Imagine if during the entire baseball game, you just watched the highlight at the end  and took all that time to learn something.  Anyway, Jim Norton's on his way.  All right.  Maybe we'd have a smarter nation.  Well, here it is.  This is what it comes down to, the Mets and the Cardinals.  This is what you missed last night.  You saw the numbers, 6 out of 23 in this series against St. Louis. 
[00:04:00]  That is ripped into right.  Back at the track, and that's a start for the Mets.  1-0 New York.  There you go.  All right.  You get your big home run.  There you go.  There's the home run.  Gets the crowd going wild.  So there's the excitement, and then two hours of nothingness.  Two hours goes by.  Maybe even more.  And then you get this.  Runner at second, 2 out, 2-1 pitch.  Eckstein chops it to the right side. 
[00:04:30]  Valentin sends this one to being seventh.  A final of 4-2 in game six.  And the Mets and Cardinals will hook up tomorrow night.  And, of course, you got BTO in the background taking care of business.  The Mets took care of business.  They took care of business.  And I was talking to Joel Highlander yesterday.  He said if the Mets win yesterday, last night, he wanted to invite us to game seven tonight 
[00:05:00]  at Shea Stadium.  Really?  I'm like, on what planet does that make sense?  See, he should know, being our boss-o-bosses, that we get up a little early.  I mean, it would be great.  I would love to go to a game seven at Shea Stadium tonight.  Yeah.  I would love to.  It would be fantastic.  But I think people are just, you know, getting into their driveways as we speak from last  night's game.  They're still coming home.  I mean, the game's in around a quarter to 12. 
[00:05:30]  Then you got to get out of Shea Stadium.  Yeah, that takes a long time.  You know, we're not getting home until 1, 1.30 in the morning, and then we have to get  up by 4 for the show.  Shot.  And we're too dedicated to the radio show, believe it or not.  That stinks.  Oh, I would have liked to.  Is he going?  Did he want to go with us, or is he just, like, going to give us tickets?  He want to take you and I, yeah.  Oh, see, a little hobnobbing.  That would have been hobnobbing with the boss at the big game.  Hell, we can still go. 
[00:06:00]  We can.  And just give the people a really crappy show tomorrow.  Or duck out early so people can call up and go, dude, I saw you leaving like the fifth  inning.  Faggot.  What a fan.  Big fan you are.  You're a real Mets fan, huh?  Anyway, let's go to Matt.  Pretty good networking thing, you know?  Kind of a hang out, talk to the boss.  Right.  You got, what, eight hours to sit there with him?  He's a cool guy to hang out with.  Yeah.  He was calling yesterday to congratulate us on the rating so far. 
[00:06:30]  Mm-hmm.  Like I said, yesterday, New York looking really good.  Boston looking just ridiculous.  Amazing Boston.  Kicking Mantown's ass in Boston.  Philly, we still have some work to do, but it's promising.  But yeah, it was, we were moving up.  We thought Philly would be easy, so this is kind of a curveball.  We got to figure out how to get around that, but we'll be just fine in Philly.  And then the ratings came out for Cleveland and Washington yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  I think it came out for Providence as well, but no one gave me those ratings, so I don't 
[00:07:00]  know what's going on there.  But Cleveland, forget about it.  Yeah.  Thank you, Cleveland.  Just destroying Cleveland.  Thank you, Cleveland.  And I hear D.C., you know, JFK, which is a fine radio station, I hear we're doing very  well on WJFK.  All right.  I don't have the breakdowns yet, but I was told that we did very well in Washington,  D.C. and Cleveland yesterday.  So, Matt in Boston, what's up?  We get another three months.  Yeah, I know.  Well, not really. 
[00:07:30]  I mean, we got-  Ratings.  We got another, what, 20 ratings books to go through.  I know.  And then it finally ends, and then it begins again.  Every day we get ratings for like a two-week period.  Matt, what's up?  Yeah, speaking of ratings, man, those guys got to change the times for playoff games.  They have it in 04.  I couldn't watch any of the playoff games, because I get up at 4.30, 5 in the morning  to go to work.  Yeah.  And the ratings are suffering.  It showed the other night.  Like, this is like one of the lowest years for baseball ratings. 
[00:08:00]  It's terrible.  What do they do it for?  The West Coast?  West Coast.  Yeah.  They've been arguing this on-  The West Coast isn't even part of the demographic, though.  Who cares about the West Coast?  Everybody on the East Coast is watching.  When you get New York, that's the biggest market to be watching people.  Matt, everyone agrees with you.  They've been arguing this point on sports radio for years.  And I guess they want to get the West Coast involved in the playoffs.  But I say you started at 7.30, and the game gets way more interesting, an hour, hour and  a half in anyway. 
[00:08:30]  And you'll still get your West Coast audience.  And then you'll probably get more people on the East Coast staying up late to watch the  game.  If you're not a huge fan of the Mets, you're not staying up to midnight to watch these  games.  Right.  And if you have XM radio, you get to listen to all the playoff games on your ride home  on the West Coast.  You're all set.  There you go, you know.  But if you're like kind of a baseball fan, but you don't really care if the Mets or the  Cardinals win, you know, and the game's ending around 11, I think you're going to get a lot  more people just checking it out.  Yep. 
[00:09:00]  It's really frustrating, man.  Let's go to Pete in the Bronx.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Pete.  I've been listening to you guys for a few weeks now.  I really love this show.  You guys make me piss my pants every morning.  That doesn't sound very good.  Hey.  You might want to get that checked, Pete.  Yeah.  He's got medication for that, sir.  What's up, Pete?  I'm listening from 5.56 every morning.  I can't wait till your show starts. 
[00:09:30]  5.56.  Well, thank you, sir.  He's got the Kenny syndrome.  We appreciate that, all right?  No problem.  I'm telling everybody about open-edged me, baby.  All right.  In the Bronx?  You got it.  In the Bronx, baby.  That's pretty cool.  We got a lot of the homeboys listening.  You think we got a lot of the homeboys?  It works, but yeah, I check my email.  Yeah?  I finally just...  I smoke my funny cigarette.  Yeah?  I smoke my funny cigarette on the way to work, and I piss my pants.  All right.  How are we...  Funny cigarette.  Are we for or against Fabulous? 
[00:10:00]  Or is it...  Fabulous.  Fabulous.  It's Fabulous.  Yeah, let's talk to the brothers right now.  Are we down with Fabulous?  We down with Fabulous.  Fabulous been shot.  He's going to be all right.  I'm down with you guys, baby.  Wow!  I don't think this guy's too street.  The word on the street is that, you know, it had something to do with an NBA player.  Really?  The shooting, yeah.  Is that what they're saying about the Fabulous shooting?  That's the word on the street.  You got to listen to the hip-hop station, I guess. 
[00:10:30]  They probably have all the inside info.  What do we know?  We're white boys.  They're talking Sebastian Telfair, who plays, of course, for the Celtics.  The Celtics, of course.  He was going into one of Puffy's joints, and he got his bling.  Do they still call it bling?  I need a real brother on the phone so we can talk about this.  Do they still call it bling?  I think it could be called bling, but there are other things it's called also.  Well, Sebastian Telfair was going into a Puffy restaurant in Chelsea.  Puffy's place, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  With his Bentley, and he decided it's a Bentley so he could park it right in front.  And the restaurant said, man, Telfair, you keep your car out there.  It's going to get towed.  The cops are going to come and tow it.  Now, who told him that?  Or give him a ticket.  Well, the restaurant manager there or something.  Like some of Puffy's thugs that run the joint?  So Telfair went to the parking lot with his Bentley, and he got his bling ripped off him.  $50,000.  And then he went into the restaurant, and he saw some of Fabulous's posse talking. 
[00:11:30]  Fabulous.  And he saw one of the guys, and he said he saw the guy that stole his bling.  That stole his bling.  And they asked Telfair.  I can't believe I know this.  I know.  And I'm waiting for a brother.  I'm stunned.  I'm watching you stunned that you know this story.  And Telfair, they go up to Telfair.  They go, you want to report this as a robbery?  And, of course, Telfair, you know, you can't.  You can't do that.  You got to take care of yourself.  That's what they do on the street.  Brother, that's what they do on the street.  Take care of my own business.  So he's like, no, I'm no snitch. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  But then rumor has it.  Uh-oh.  And this is where I'll start with rumor has it.  Rumor has it.  It's being alleged.  People are saying Telfair was then outside talking to somebody.  Well, here it is.  A witness at the restaurant told the Post Telfair loudly complained of being robbed.  But when asked by security if he wanted to call police, he said no.  He then got on his cell phone and was heard telling someone, get over here and take care of it. 
[00:12:30]  Uh-oh.  So he's calling up his boys?  You know, police said some members of the Golden Tongue Rhymer's crew, known as the Street Family,  have been involved in a tit-for-tat war of medallion theft with other gangs around Bedford-Stuyvesant.  Medallion theft.  Uh, where the rapper grew up and had a long list of enemies.  A short time later, Fabulous and three members of his crew walked out to the parking lot and were approached by a gunman.  The unknown thug fired nine shots at them, striking the rapper once in the right thigh, cops.  Nine shots, hits him once in the thigh. 
[00:13:00]  Can these guys go to a range once in a while?  Man.  Can you just go to a friggin' range so you can at least hit your targets and not innocent bystanders?  You're not down.  And kids in a playground?  You're not down, brother.  Ah, my.  He didn't shoot to kill.  No?  No, it's not a crime for murder.  He was teaching them a lesson?  Yeah.  Trust me.  Nine shots.  You're gonna hit him?  I understand they shoot sideways, upside down.  And just going, buck, buck, yeah.  And they're talking so much smack and jumping as they're shooting that bullets are just flying everywhere. 
[00:13:30]  You like that?  You take that.  No, I think the latest...  Break yourself.  Break yourself.  The latest, uh, way to shoot?  Yeah.  They do headstands now.  You actually do a headstand.  And then you start shooting.  But do you turn the gun then right side up in a headstand so it's upside down to you, but relative to your target it's right side up?  Yeah, you try to do that.  But now they're saying Sebastian Telfair may have something to do with Fabulous's shooting. 
[00:14:00]  I want to see him start shooting with mirrors over their shoulders.  Yeah.  Like Old West tricks.  Yeah.  Just any type of shooting that is completely unsafe to the people around who you're shooting at.  Right.  God.  So that's the latest.  It's in, uh...  Wow, I'm stunned at your knowledge of this hip-hop crime.  And it's called just a medallion and not bling?  Medallion theft?  Is that like a thing that's going on?  You gotta steal the tiki idol?  Yeah.  Is that it off of people?  And then you collect them? 
[00:14:30]  And the one that was ripped off Telfair's neck was worth like $50,000.  If you're pulling up in a Bentley with a $50,000 medallion around your neck and you're part of the hip-hop community...  Right.  ...you're gonna get robbed.  You're gonna get robbed!  Are you crazy?  All right, well...  I don't even stop at lights around that, uh...  That's what's going on in the community.  I mean, if we're talking to the Bronx, we gotta know what's going on.  Here's, uh...  Here's what was stolen from him. 
[00:15:00]  The actual tiki idol from the Brady Bunch.  Uh, let's say hi to Meg in Boston.  Meg, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Yesterday I was listening to AAF before you guys came on, and they were bragging about their ratings.  They're bragging about their ratings?  How are they bragging?  In Mantown?  Yeah.  Are they insane?  Yeah.  They were saying, oh, thank you, Boston.  We're doing great with all the odds against us.  Oh, my God. 
[00:15:30]  Odds against them?  They've been there eight million years.  What's the odds against them?  Yeah, what's the odds against them?  They're a local show, and we're a syndicated show out of New York, and we're kicking their ass.  Well, I never hear them actually say your name.  I don't think they want to plug you guys, but they'll always say, well, the competition's changed the past month and a half,  and we have been told it's going to be a lot to go up against, and they said, oh, no, we're doing great.  And, yeah.  They're honest.  They're totally lying.  They're dropping like a rock.  Yeah, they lost a lot in the ocean there. 
[00:16:00]  They're awful.  We're kicking Mantown.  Mantown.  Good.  Faggot Radio's losing to Opie and Anthony.  They're going to have to retire to the Lazy Boy Recliners and the ball game.  That's right.  In Mantown.  No, honestly, the ratings in Boston were almost better than what we're doing in New York.  Yep.  The Boston ratings were ridiculous.  I would think so.  I mean, there are conservative, like, views, and it's a democratic state, so, I mean, no one wants to hear that crap anyway. 
[00:16:30]  And we don't have any views.  What, they talk too much politics?  No, yes, they do all day.  I remember way back when Hillman was pretty conservative.  I don't see as that has changed.  So, you know, you kind of alienate.  At least we have zero consistency in our political views.  Like, one day we can be staunch right-wingers talking about certain things.  And then the next day we're bed-wetting liberals. 
[00:17:00]  Right, right.  I don't know how that happens.  Maybe we're just schizo.  Well, I don't know what they're talking about, Meg.  We're kicking their ass.  Everyone knows it.  I'm glad.  Everyone in the know knows it anyway.  The people that get the actual ratings books and take a look at it, they know.  You can say whatever you want on the air, apparently.  You don't have to adhere to any actual facts, which is hysterical.  Well, you know what happens.  I've been doing radio a really long time.  What these radio stations will do and these morning shows will do, they will find that 
[00:17:30]  one tiny little demo that they may be number one in.  It might be, like, men 35 to 40 that wear slacks and are balding and go to man-town.  And they have to drive a minivan because their wife told them to.  We're number one with those people.  And then they'll have a big, like, you know, promo on the air.  We're the number one station in Boston. 
[00:18:00]  And then you break it down and you realize they're number one in this tiny, tiny little  who cares demo.  Maybe they're talking about the actual ratings of man-town.  Right, right.  Is that a market?  I don't know.  Man-town?  Come on.  Unzip your flies, gentlemen, and show us how much you like our program.  I've got to be honest.  We were hoping for, you know, a better fight from the people in man-town because it's just  so much fun to goof on man-town and how stupid it is.  But once you beat them, it's, you know, kind of stupid. 
[00:18:30]  We beat them after the first month, like the first trend.  We were only back a month and we beat them.  We're like, oh, this sucks.  Yeah.  Because we want to make fun of them some more.  And then our first, you know, full book comes out that we're responsible for with nobody  else in there.  Yeah.  It's just our show.  Yeah.  And it's over, Johnny.  There you go.  We beat them.  All right.  Well, thank you there, Meg.  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks, Meg.  Basically, what we're trying to say is they're full of, you know, crap, crap. 
[00:19:00]  You're full of crap, crap.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Freddie in Brooklyn.  Freddie, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Love you guys.  Oh, thanks, Freddie.  When you guys talk about the brothers, that's the funniest stuff.  Back in the days, I saw you talked about River and Al and the...  Oh.  River and Al.  Yeah, go ahead, Eddie.  I'm going after the Cracker Barrel.  Cracker-ass Cracker Barrel.  Oh.  Would you turn some lights on, Opie?  Trying to wake some people up around here. 
[00:19:30]  Trying to wake some people up.  And has decided to do an impression.  Let's go.  Goddamn.  Finally trying to do one after three years.  I am outraged at Cracker Barrel.  But we should know with the name Cracker Barrel that there are going to be problems serving the black man.  So I've decided to take this upon myself.  I am looking to speak with Mr. Barrel.  What was his name, Jimmy? 
[00:20:00]  Fred.  Fred Barrel, I'm calling you out.  A black man will not dine at the Cracker Barrel until I speak to Mr. Frank Barrel, CEO of the Cracker-ass Cracker Barrel.  What's the problem there, Reverend Al?  We are going to Coon Barrel now.  Screw Cracker Barrel.  How about monkeys in a barrel?  Barrel full of Reverend Al.  I try to keep it a little cleaner than you.  All right.  Thank you, fan. 
[00:20:30]  Now I can say **** Barrel.  I am outraged at the Cracker-ass Cracker.  Why not just call it Honky Barrel?  Whitey Barrel.  The Devil Barrel.  I'm opening a new chain called **** Barrel.  That way people know what they're getting.  All my **** can come in and eat as many crackers as they want.  Where do they serve a Cracker Barrel?  I just picture you sit your ass on a barrel and eat crackers.  That sounds like **** to me. 
[00:21:00]  Over that **** Barrel, you're going to come in and get fried chicken,  chitlins, black-eyed peas, and you'll be served within three minutes unless you're white.  Then we're going to shoot your ****.  Well, Reverend Al, you have a problem with Chris Rock's mom, right?  Do I?  I didn't read the whole story.  Wait a minute.  You don't have a problem with her personally, but you're helping her cause because she feels  like she wasn't served because she was black.  Maybe she wasn't served because they were just really, really busy and they never got to her. 
[00:21:30]  Busy?  Yeah.  How busy could you get?  What's your order?  I'll have the crackers.  Thank you.  I'll be right back.  How long can it take?  They serve more than just crackers.  Do they?  Yeah.  I didn't do my research.  I just saw a good opportunity to be in the news.  But look for my Reverend Al **** Barrel stores opening up for **** only.  All right, Reverend Al.  Thank you.  Another way for him to just jump on the bandwagon. 
[00:22:00]  Oof.  I was pretty sad if he's going after this one.  It's been a while.  What happened to Reverend Al, man?  He used to go after the big causes.  Big ones.  Now he's helping out Chris Rock's mom because she didn't get served at Cracker Barrel?  It's not exactly that.  She's claiming racism or whatever?  Yeah.  Wow.  Not exactly the biggest thing he's ever done in his career.  You notice when he's running for office, though, all this crap goes away?  When he runs for any political office?  Yeah.  He really doesn't jump on these things. 
[00:22:30]  He's done.  He tries to be a mainstream and be accepted by white people.  And then once he's not running for office, he could go off on these wacky things.  I think he's a joke at this point.  Yeah.  Well.  His time is over, Johnny.  He'll never.  It's all about Obama.  Oh, you like the Obama?  He's going to run, bro.  Where's he running?  He's going to run for president.  Obama.  You know.  Obama.  Obama.  If his name was maybe Don Anderson. 
[00:23:00]  Don Knotts.  Jesus.  Donald Anderson.  I think he'd have a better chance.  You watch.  Obama is running.  How much of this country is pulling the lever with Obama next to it?  Well, you're not doing it.  Well, then, you know, then you're going to have another Republican in office because you're  going to have Obama running.  You're going to have Hillary Clinton running.  Well, we'll see who the Democrats decide to pick.  They're all going to jump in. 
[00:23:30]  I'm going to have a front runner, but it'll be a goof then.  No, I was reading Obama has to run.  Why?  Because if he doesn't run and then, you know, another Republican gets, well, a Democrat gets  in there, then he can't run until 2016.  2016.  That's assuming a Democrat wins.  And then gets real.  And then it becomes, yeah, the incumbent.  Right, right, right, right.  Wins.  I don't think so.  And he doesn't want to take that chance.  And you know he wants the presidency.  Nobody heard of him until three years ago. 
[00:24:00]  Who talked about Barack Obama?  Nobody knew who he was until three.  He makes a good speech and all of a sudden the Democrats love him.  Yeah, one good speech and they're going to groom him.  It's more than one good speech.  Because he's a black guy.  He is.  He is rolling now.  Is he?  His popularity is growing.  He's going to be on Oprah.  Oh, well, there you go.  Obama for president.  I don't see it happening.  Those Democrats are morons.  The second you lose an election, the day after, they should be grooming somebody for that office. 
[00:24:30]  You tell me who's going to win.  I'm not very familiar with the Democrats.  That's the problem.  No one is.  That's why I say Obama.  Because they're too fragmented.  There's no real unity there.  So they battle each other.  It's not going to be Obama because he's a black guy.  It might be Obama.  The middle of this country.  He's sort of black.  The middle of this country, not ready for it.  Dude, I would agree with you if it was Mickey Rivers black.  But it's Obama. 
[00:25:00]  Colin Powell would have had a hard time at his peak before he screwed up.  I think Colin Powell.  With his maps of Iraq showing an ice cream truck and saying there's chemical weapons in it.  Bling, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  You know what's in this truck?  Soft serve.  Is it?  Did the president tell you that one?  You idiot.  You wrecked your whole career.  That's good.  Helping out your boss.  I say Obama and I say he's the right color.  Wow.  He's just light enough. 
[00:25:30]  God.  God, I want to thank you for the Opie curse.  That will pretty much guarantee he cannot win.  The middle of America, middle of this country that, you know how close the elections were the past couple of years because a lot of people were pissed off at Bush.  Yeah.  The middle of the country still voted for Bush, but some of the people were so disillusioned that they went Democrat.  Yeah.  They would never go Democrat if a black guy was running.  It's just another land. 
[00:26:00]  It's a whole other land in the middle of this country.  We have very liberal thinking on the East Coast and the West Coast, very open-minded sometimes, but in the middle, very traditional.  I'll use the word traditional thinking.  Then you find a better candidate than Obama.  He's running, my friend.  If they run Obama, if they try to run Hillary, it's just going to be a joke ticket and the Republicans are going to win the presidency again.  Obama's no joke.  They tried running abroad with Walter Mondale.  They lost 49 states.  Oh, who was that? 
[00:26:30]  Ferrara?  Geraldine Ferrara.  Geraldine Ferrara.  49 to 1.  That was Reagan.  Husband had a few problems of his own legally.  Maybe you ought to check that out before you throw your hat in the ring.  I'm just saying it's all about Obama.  You watch.  You watch what happens in the coming months.  You watch, all right.  You watch.  You better not drive around in any open vehicles the way this country thinks.  Obama.  Don't go to Dallas.  He's not Mickey Rivers Black.  That's what I say. 
[00:27:00]  And that's what the campaign slogan should be.  You think that that should actually be?  Right.  Just to distract him because it's all about a black president.  I get that.  I'm Obama.  At least I'm not Mickey Rivers Black.  Yeah, then you're going to get,  Well, you know, that's pretty good.  He makes a point.  That boy makes a point.  Let me pull the lever for him.  Ain't going to happen.  You've got some whiteys that will vote because he's not Mickey Rivers Black.  I'm telling you right now.  That's just how the country works.  Ask the brothers.  They look at each other and go, 
[00:27:30]  Man, you're not as black as me.  Don't see that putting him over the top.  I think it could swing some votes, though.  Campaign slogan.  Who are we to pick?  At least I'm not.  Mickey Rivers Black.  Predict the future, Opie.  Good luck with you there, though, if you want to support him.  Too bad I couldn't come up with a better reference.  I have to go back to a Yankee that played in, what, the 50s?  Actually, the 70s, whatever.  But how about Barack Obama, dot, dot, dot, dark, but not criminally so? 
[00:28:00]  Thanks, Anthony.  I like that.  It could also work as a campaign slogan.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Break.  Just getting started here.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest began like a stampede of hungry rhinos.  But now it more closely resembles a sleepy, winded elephant.  The current heavyweight in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is Crystal from Cleveland, who weighed in at 430 pounds. 
[00:28:30]  We're so sure there's someone bigger out there, we put up a fatty finder's fee in the amount of $1,000 to the person who brings in the heaviest girl by the end of the contest.  So grab your sonar equipment and find us a whale.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest gets $10 for every floorboard-shattering, tear-inducing, self-esteem-destroying pound on her body.  Fat-bottom girls, you make the rockin' world go round.  Go to opieandanthony.com for contest details.  Sponsored by H57 Hootia.

[00:29:30]  Saying hi to Cleveland today, personally.  That's what I'm doing.  Yeah?  That's what I do now.  You hate Cleveland.  I don't hate them when they show up in droves to listen to this program, according to the ratings.  Wow.  But we have to say it again.  We just don't understand downtown Cleveland.  Yeah.  We don't know much about Cleveland.  I don't know.  To make any real opinion.  How did we get such good numbers when there was nobody there? 
[00:30:00]  I'm sure the suburbs are lovely.  Maybe that's it.  Because, wow, great numbers in Cleveland.  Thank you, Cleveland.  And Washington, supposedly.  Really good.  Haven't seen those yet.  I heard we got some bumps.  They're calling it bumps in the ratings.  I'm looking forward to Pittsburgh.  I'm looking forward to West Palm.  I want to see some action.  What about Buffalo?  Hey, Buffalo.  What do you have against Buffalo?  I don't have anything against Buffalo except for their weather. 
[00:30:30]  I love Buffalo.  We had one of our greatest parties ever in Buffalo.  So, I adore Buffalo.  Was that the number one party ever for the Opie and Anthony show?  Number one party ever in Buffalo was the T&A with O&A.  Had to be.  Who's going to argue that?  There was 20 illegal, perverted acts going on on the beach in full public view.  And no one got arrested. 
[00:31:00]  What a fantastic party.  I stumble across those videos from time to time.  They're on the internet.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you flip around checking out Opie and Anthony stuff and you'll see the pictures from that day.  I bet those are getting used, too, those pictures.  What do you mean?  Those aren't just pictures that guys look through or videos that you look at and go,  wow, that looked like a fun time.  I bet they're being used for certain pleasurable things.  Because you see what's happening in some of those pictures.  The still pictures alone are amazing.  Yeah.  Looked like a gynecologist took them. 
[00:31:30]  But that's the greatest party ever.  What about Asbury Park?  What about Island Park on Long Island?  That would have been better if I didn't have to wear Kevlar the entire time we were there.  Asbury Park.  They're trying to turn that area around, too.  But when we were down there, it was a scary, scary place.  Good luck.  Very scary place.  Good luck to you.  And then Island Park, remember the, what was it called?  Remember we had the foam and the girls dancing and the girl cracked their skull open? 
[00:32:00]  That was fun.  Yeah.  Figured it would be a good thing to have a bunch of foam.  Because that was kind of big.  Late 90s.  Late 90s.  We went European.  Mid 90s.  We went European at one of our parks.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  And the foam would start, and everybody's raving, and the foam, and some girl slips and just cracks her head open.  You just see foam with this little bubbling red, bloody foam popping up in one spot, and you know someone's injured. 
[00:32:30]  A bit on the pink side.  Yeah, what the hell's the pink foam?  Well, we have another party coming everyone's way.  This is a good segue.  Ooh.  The Open Anthony Halloween Party is being brought to you by Saw 3, opening in theaters Friday, October 27th.  Love the Saw movies.  Suffering?  You haven't seen anything yet.  Saw 3.  I like the Saw movies.  You seen any of them?  I have not seen the Saw movies.  Do you know anything about the Saw movies?  I know the end of the first one.  All right. 
[00:33:00]  I was told.  That ruins it.  Oh, okay.  I've heard about the ending.  Yeah, okay.  I think everyone is, yeah.  Stan's all mad at me.  Why?  Because at some point, I guess I gave away the ending a while back when it first came out and was in theaters.  That's how I know it.  That's right.  And so Stan's just watching it.  Okay.  Whatever.  Kind of knows.  But I like those movies.  And they pump them out pretty quickly.  I just like the senseless violence and pain and the surprise and things like that. 
[00:33:30]  I like those movies.  Yeah.  Are we announcing where the Halloween party is going to be?  Oh.  I don't know.  No?  Gee, I wonder where.  Yeah, same place.  Come on.  The faithful listeners.  Let's be real here.  Know where it's going to be.  And we do it a little different with our Halloween party.  We're looking for costumes that have something to do with the show.  Mm-hmm.  And then we'll have a nice prize for the best costume that night.  Are you dressing up this time?  Because I know you never have dressed up for a Halloween party.  No, I will not be dressing up. 
[00:34:00]  Jimmy Norton, any costume?  No, I don't think so.  Can't even get the question out and you're already saying no.  I'm not too embarrassed to put on costumes.  Unless it's like something obviously cheap.  But I'm always afraid I'm going to put a lot of effort into a costume.  Could you?  And it's going to suck and people are just going to laugh at me.  Come as a cherubish comic with a Breathe Right strip on his nose.  Come as an ass.  As a total ass.  What are you thinking?  I'm thinking this year.  Of wearing.  I'm thinking this year I might come as some type of renaissance man. 
[00:34:30]  Ugh.  With a sword and a thing.  What do you think?  I do it every year.  No, I need a new gag.  Well, you could go, but just make sure you have a lute.  Yeah, I would have to be a lute.  Should I be a bard this year?  I'll be a bard with a lute.  I'm sure someone will be dressed up and they'll be carrying a lute at our Halloween party.  That'd be good.  See, that's a good example of somebody.  A nut with a lute.  I was watching Studio 60 or what's the other one?  30 Rock.  30 Rock.  30 Rock.  I think it was Studio 60. 
[00:35:00]  And they worked Sting performing on the lute into the show.  And were they goofing on them?  No.  Like how beautiful it was and Sting playing the lute.  They didn't goof on it?  You know, because it's a variety of show and what happens behind the scenes kind of like  an SNL sort of.  Yeah.  And they got Sting as the performer.  And he's, you know, performing on the lute.  And then they're doing a little dialogue and you can hear Sting in the background. 
[00:35:30]  Boy, is he trying to sell that thing.  He'll show up on anything.  Can we get him?  Probably.  Let's get him on this show to sit in that seat and play his stupid lute.  Probably.  So, he did Fields of Dreams or whatever.  No, Fields of Gold.  Right.  Thank you.  Now he's starting to do police songs because he realizes there's lute stuff.  Everybody thinks stinks.  No one wants to hear the 15th century songs.  So, he's playing police songs awful.  Well, one.  He did Message in a Bottle and, yeah, Fields of Gold or whatever.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  That's one of his solo songs.  This might be the thing that drives him back to the police.  That's what I'm hoping.  Failure.  That's what I'm hoping.  That's what I'm thinking.  This might be what everybody needed to get them back out.  If he did something like on an SNL where he went out on the lute, if I was the band,  I would make sure I knew what police song he was doing and just crank it up full volume  rock like the old days and drown out his lute and make it so he has to sing it like the  police.  Stupid lute.  We'll have more on the Halloween party, but I'm sure someone will show up with a lute. 
[00:36:30]  I dress up every year, so I'll figure something out.  People have fun with it.  They like making fun of me, especially you.  It's awkward for everybody.  Let's be honest, Andy.  Why is it awkward?  It's one day.  It's Halloween.  It's what it's meant for is to dress up a little and have a little fun.  I don't like things like, I've never dressed as a girl.  I don't get that whole thing.  Some guys really enjoy once a year the ability to dress like a woman.  Travis does it all year long.  And then on one day, maybe Halloween, he could dress like an actual man. 
[00:37:00]  You could wear a construction hard hat and a tool belt.  Like a manly thing.  Just figure one day a year.  You could wear a girl naked and not throw up.  So I wouldn't do something like that.  But, you know, I'm not really into the horror thing either.  Like Dracula, things like that, dress like that.  I don't know.  I kind of like being a little different.  Ah, the faggier, the better for you.  No.  What?  Renaissance.  I had an actual sword. 
[00:37:30]  I could have run through.  Like I said, the faggier, the better.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Cast a spell.  Are you going to be bringing your beanbag spell?  I'll bring beanbags and throw them at the audience while I cast my spells.  You've all been slowed.  Ugh.  The Halloween party, though, is a hot ticket every year, so we're looking forward to it.  And they want us to broadcast live this year.  It's going to be just a train wreck for the rest of the country.  We have said we refuse to do broadcasts from live events. 
[00:38:00]  We either broadcast from someplace or do a live event.  We never the twain shall meet.  And for some reason now they want us to do it.  Yeah.  And it's a night thing.  Well, because they sell the crap out of it.  It's exactly it.  That's the only reason.  They don't care about a nice broadcast from you and I.  They just realize it's an opportunity to sell the crap out of it.  This Halloween show is brought to you by blah, blah, blah.  Hoping Anthony walking on stage, sponsored by Dr. Scholz. 
[00:38:30]  They sponsor everything.  See, because it's hard to do a show where you can entertain people live in a venue, in the audience, and do a live radio broadcast.  You usually have to be tucked away somewhere and then occasionally come out, do something for the crowd that's preplanned, entertaining for both the people there and the radio audience, and then go back and do pretty much a show, a radio show.  But when you're sitting there in front of animals trying to do a program, it's a little rough. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  So we'll see what happens.  Yeah, we will.  Cluster F.  Great.  Kent in Jersey, what's up?  Hey there, Kent.  Hey, what's going on?  You guys missed the point.  Oh, you missed the point on Studio 60.  They did goof on Sting.  See, when I was watching, I only took a quick look at it because I'm like, here's Sting again with his stupid lute.  Ta-da!  Did you hear that part?  I couldn't tell you the first thing about Studio 60.  Yeah, they show the dress rehearsal and then they show the actual show. 
[00:39:30]  He did that medieval crap in the dress rehearsal and the producer made him do that field of gold in the actual performance.  Oh, really?  He was going to do one of the old songs?  Politely without saying it, he said that the medieval stuff sucked.  Okay.  I'm not into Studio 60.  See, I'm into 30 Rock, though, with Tracy Morgan and Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin.  That show is hilarious.  That's hilarious.  Hilarious.  That show is hilarious.  That show is hilarious.  It's hilarious because Tracy Morgan is finally being himself on TV. 
[00:40:00]  It's the same Tracy Morgan we got to see backstage at the ONA Traveling Virus.  Just a nut.  Yeah, he's actually insane.  Yeah, he's just a nut.  I agree.  He's barely acting on that show.  All right, Ken, thank you.  He's so loud.  I got you back.  When I was on stage in Philadelphia, I think it was in Camden, I'm in the middle of my acting and I hear a noise backstage.  And I'm like, I thought somebody was heckling me.  It was Tracy backstage.  I'm in front of 10,000 people and I can hear him yapping backstage. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  He was holding court.  That's what he does.  A little too close to where Jimmy was performing, unfortunately.  Yeah, within four blocks.  He's the loudest man on earth.  He's yelling and actually acting things out.  Like, he won't just say, you know, so this guy's doing push-ups.  He gets down and starts doing push-ups and I'll smack a bitch and he's got to, like, mime it all out as he's just yelling.  He's great.  Take a peek at 30 Rock with Tracy Morgan.  He's doing all right, man.  He's a very tough guy to have a conversation with.  Like, I like the guy that he's very funny, but it's like he'll walk up to you and just go, make it up money, son. 
[00:41:00]  You're like, why?  I don't know where I can go with that.  What are you saying to me?  All right.  And he's got bodyguards around him kind of nodding.  And you don't want to seem like the nerd white guy who didn't get the reference.  You didn't get the reference.  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, it's like, Tracy, man, I saw the show, looking great.  Yeah, you got some wheels, man?  What do I?  I think he's just messing with all of us.  What does that mean?  I think he's uber smart.  He's just messing with us.  He's like, look, see, paranoid, scared white boy thinks I'm actually saying something to him. 
[00:41:30]  That would be really funny for you black people to do.  It's so funny that we all noticed that because I was talking to people backstage going, am I stupid?  Because I don't really know what he's saying to me.  Yo, bro, that's molasses on a kneecap.  And you're like, what is it?  What does that mean, Tracy?  That would be funny for you black people to do to us, though.  Just come out with stuff that we don't understand and watch if we laugh or just smile politely or run in fear of our lives.  We'll never call you on it.  We look at your entourage. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's the proper reaction, and we fake it.  Yeah, we will never say, what does that mean?  Well, does that, yeah.  What the hell is he talking about?  Yeah, I just nod kind of knowingly and then just walk away with our whiteness and our whiteness.  I almost said something, and I realized what side of the show we were on.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say hi to John.  Hey, John.  I'll tell you anyway.  John.  Hey there, John.  You're on the air.  John.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my goodness.  Come on, John.  I'm sorry.  I'm from Curry City.  I got the biggest Fatty McFatty you've ever seen in your life. 
[00:42:30]  Fatty McFatty?  It's not Fatty McFatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  It's Fatty Pig Fatty.  All right, where are you from?  Jersey City.  But I'm from Seacaucus.  The lady's from Jersey City.  What happened was this summer when the electricity went out, they gave me a call and told me at the gym I work out.  You know, I'm slash bodybuilder slash trainer.  So they told me that there's a woman.  Slash your throat.  So basically the town had to cut the door open to get her out to the hospital. 
[00:43:00]  Ah, one of these fatties that can't move themselves.  Yeah, but when they weighed her, she was 690.  And now, even though her workout consists of moving her leg two inches and times, you know, and then just moving her fingers.  And then she's like, I'm winded, I'm winded.  And she smokes like eight packs of cigarettes.  What's wrong with you, John?  Yeah, you don't sound like you're in shape.  You sound like Saul Rosenberg.  Yeah.  No, I'm sorry.  I work out this early.  I just took the stuff I work out with. 
[00:43:30]  I'm getting wired to work out.  What, broken glass?  I'm going to see her at 9 o'clock today.  And how do you know her, sir?  I'm sorry.  How do you know her?  He had to help her.  I know her, but I'm her trainer.  Oh.  After they got her out, I guess she needed to lose weight and they called this guy in.  Yeah, they said she wanted to lose weight and coverage.  So what, you go to her house and help her with the workouts?  I go there and she moves her leg like 10 times, like two inches.  Yeah.  And that's basically what she can do.  And she has a little ball that she squeezes. 
[00:44:00]  And she's winded.  I'm talking.  I never seen a lady ready to drop dead quicker.  Oh, man.  The only thing is, this is good for you guys.  I used to listen to Howard Stern every day.  Yeah.  I put you guys on one day.  And the only thing my Sirius satellite radio now is, isn't the dust.  Because all I do is listen to you.  But she still listens to Howard Stern.  She doesn't know about the contest I mentioned.  Do you lift the Sirius unit as your workout? 
[00:44:30]  I'm surprised she hasn't eaten it.  I don't even do that.  I don't even think it exists anymore on September.  Well, John, what's the odds of getting her in here for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest?  We talked about getting her in Friday.  And she said that if you didn't make fun of her, what I was going to do was call in at 9 o'clock.  And you could tell her it's not to make fun of her.  It's just a simple way.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We need a doctor for us to suture our mouths shut.  Yeah.  Can that happen?  And we need her to lose 480 pounds before she gets here.  You can do what you want.  I don't care.  Once she weighs herself, you can friggin' ride her. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Listen.  Here's the deal.  We got now three girls over 500 pounds that are saying they're going to come in.  When are they coming in, though, man?  I can get her in.  Enough with the promises.  Just get in here.  Now, how would you bring her in?  She doesn't sound very mobile.  Well, what happens is she has this special truck that comes.  And if I throw the guys, I tell them, look, I'll give you half the 500 bucks, you know, that I'm going to get.  I'm sure these two guys will drive her there. 
[00:45:30]  You get 1,000.  All right.  Well, yeah.  Here's the deal.  We're paying $10 a pound.  Actually, H57 Hootie is paying $10 a pound.  Shut up.  Lose weight for free at H57.com.  I got to get the plug in for that, too.  Six Gs this woman would be worth.  Yeah, $10 a pound, $6,000 for her, and $1,000 for you for bringing her in.  A finder's fee.  He's a heck of a trainer.  He's, like, just trying to teach her to get herself a steamy.  He's, like, look, do you want to put on a pig mask and stand on a scale for the national audience?  $6,000.  For six grand. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, she might be cracking seven now, for all I know.  Right.  What are you training her with, sir?  Just a whip and some hay?  Basically, if she goes to the trough, I know she's in a good mood that day.  Just do the old gag, get, like, a long stick and, like, a dessert, and she has to just continually walk toward the dessert.  Put a tortilla in front of it and let her follow.  Yeah, or a tortilla, whichever you want to put in front of her.  You tie it, like, you put a stick on her head with, like, a piece of cake hanging off it.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Tie it to her fat head.  Point it toward the station. 
[00:46:30]  She won't know.  She'll just walk towards it, clumsily lumbering.  All right.  You know, John, this sounds really good, but I don't know.  You're the third person now that has promised us a really fat girl for the Fatty Big Fatty Contest.  I don't know if I believe him.  No, but I swear on my mother's soul.  She just passed away two years ago, and I wouldn't swear on her soul.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  Well, dude, I mean, when I came back from Iraq, and this was a gift from God.  All right.  So what were you saying, dude?  You swear?  Why do you swear?  I would never swear on my mother, but this I will, because for the money, she wants a big screen TV, 
[00:47:00]  and this is the only way she feels the money.  All right.  You know, 600 pounds is going to win this contest.  You know, the girl from Binghamton that's 541, she would win the contest.  Just one of you have to come in.  Why does she want a big screen TV so she can use it as a tray to eat on in bed?  No, that's exactly what she does.  She sits in this chair that moves, but, I mean, when you hear the engine strain,  I think they need to put, like, a lawnmower engine on it, because this thing barely moves. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  All right.  Listen, you're babbling enough.  Let's make it happen.  All right.  Give us an update later on this morning.  Oh, shut up.  Give us an update later this morning, all right?  Huh?  Give us an update later this morning, but someone is saying you're lying.  I think you're lying.  Yeah, he just sounds a little too showy.  Let's hear from Billy.  See what he says on line six.  All right.  Billy.  Billy.  Oh, hey, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, listen, I'm really thinking this guy's full of it, 
[00:48:00]  because he was on Elvis and JV yesterday about the topic they had about the most blood you've  ever seen in one time.  They were talking about blood, and he said that he killed somebody by cutting their jugular  or something like that.  Oh, well, he just hung up, too.  Yeah.  He just hung up, too.  He sounded like he was a little too weird with the voice.  Well, we do have two other people out there that want to bring fatties in, so, you know,  we're just waiting for them to show up at this point.  Everyone's promising us a real big fatty for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest. 
[00:48:30]  Hopefully, it'll happen.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We got Jerry Springer update.  We got to talk about NFL terror.  We got to talk about that New Orleans couple.  Oh, that's a cute story.  Could be the story of the day, right?  Such a cute story.  Heather Mills.  Yeah.  And, of course, the retarded man that was sodomized with blank.  With a blank.  You fill in the blank.  With a blank.  I'm actually mentally rolling the dice going, come on, vegetable. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, that would be nice, actually.  He wishes.  He certainly does wish.  We'll give you the answer in just a bit.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the O.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and lace panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction we want to exploit,  you can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, 
[00:49:30]  or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this s***.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I just felt like doing that.  It's a good way to come back from a break, because then people aren't confused.  They know we're back from a break. 
[00:50:00]  Leave that polished radio for the other asses out there.  This is what we do.  Hey, we're back.  There you go.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.A. virus spreading across America.  Our pal Bob Saget's on the phone, and he wants to thank us for his great ratings on TV.  You guys kicked it for me, and I want to thank those three large ladies that can't fit in an elevator to come visit you.  Oh.  You know what?  We blew you off, because a guy said he had a girl that's 600 pounds that he's going to bring in from Jersey City, 
[00:50:30]  and now I have to apologize to Bob Saget.  That guy was full of crap.  You think?  I mean, I felt so bad for her.  I mean, how do you even, what's the maximum weight in, like, an Otis elevator anyway?  I think it's, yeah.  She's probably just going alone.  Yeah, she'd have to go in alone.  It's 1,300 pounds, right?  Something like that, sure.  That's our goal, to get some monster that came and make it up we have to go outside and wear in the atrium.  Oh, my God.  How's Gilbert Grape going to get the exposure?  We love this contest, but it kind of has stalled at this point. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Looking for the fattest, the heaviest girl, actually, to walk through that studio door,  and we're going to give them $10 a pound.  I'm really stunned that they feel that their dignity is worth more than $10 per pound on their body,  yet they walk around like that.  If their dignity was worth so much to them, wouldn't they lose the weight?  Well, some people just can't help it.  They have a glandular thing.  Yeah.  Glandular.  What's the gland that makes you eat Twinkies all day?  Have it removed. 
[00:51:30]  We're going to pitch this show idea to NBC, by the way, Bob.  Fatty pig fatty.  I think you just have to, like, Hannibal Lecter, just eat your way out of that.  It's going to be one versus a thousand pounds, we're going to call it.  That would be an awesome thing.  You could put a hundred people that large, and the whole thing would just collapse.  Yeah.  See, it was heavier.  You know, the people all the way at the top, you can't even medevac them up there.  It's an awesome stage.  By the way, thank you guys.  It really kicked ass in the ratings.  Bob, I've got to tell you, I purposely watched one versus a hundred. 
[00:52:00]  I think I like it better than Deal or No Deal, and I love Deal or No Deal.  Yeah, it's a good show.  They got Howie's Good on that thing, but that's really nice of you to like it, man.  It gets funnier.  I think I do more edgy stuff as the weeks go on.  You drop the C-bomb?  Yeah, I do that.  I drop it.  That's edgy.  I drop it with a T, and then I bring up a 700-pound woman, and I eat her.  Whatever it takes.  It's like a ham on Christmas. 
[00:52:30]  We're lucky to know Bob Saget personally now, and actually our audience now knows because  I think because of our show that he's a dirty boy, and then I watch one versus a hundred,  and it's back to the nice Bob Saget.  Back to the nice Bob?  Yeah.  You can see the rage, though, this time.  You can see it, actually, because now I know you.  I'm like, that guy wants to say some crap.  I said to you this at the virus.  I said, look, I'm doing it.  I'm not selling out, but it's definitely, you can't curse. 
[00:53:00]  You can't drop the F-bomb on family television, but as the weeks go on, I am saying things  that are more in the PG-13 variety.  Will this affect your stand-up career in any way?  I mean, because a lot of people now, like the old days, are going to see you and say,  oh, there's that nice Saget gentleman, and I hear he's going to be in our town.  Let's go see him, and then they're in a state of shock as they're leaving.  Then they turn into the Nazis at the end of Raiders.  Yeah, their heads explode. 
[00:53:30]  Maybe their heads blow up, and there's just all that's left is salt.  Hey, Bob, let me do the bragging for you, okay?  In its first week, the show drew 12.8 million viewers.  Wow.  A rare feat for a Friday night.  It's done so well, NBC ordered an additional 10 shows  and pushed back the season debut of Las Vegas.  Wow.  Whoa.  By the way, it was only 9 million viewers, but a lot of them were 700 pounds.  That's it.  I hear James Conn is coming to just kick your ass. 
[00:54:00]  Well, you know what's funny?  We were shooting the show, and James Conn was shooting Vegas across a thing,  and he walked over to Las Vegas to see the thing, and he comes in, and he goes,  holy crap, I want to be on this show, because the thing was gigantic.  I heard he just bit his finger and went, son of a bitch, son of a bitch,  and wrote some number down on his closet cabinet.  Well, you know what it is?  He's trying to parlay this into a Freebie and the Bean sequel.  Thank you to everyone over 58 that got this.  Wow.  That's a good reference. 
[00:54:30]  I want to drive a car into an old couple's bedroom.  That was in that movie.  You really got to be an old-timer who loved that damn movie.  Freebie and the Bean.  That's a good movie, that movie.  He did not go back to Freebie and the Bean.  Yes, he did.  He pulled the Freebie and the Bean card.  The set for the game show is one of the greatest sets I've ever seen on TV.  Just a wall of people.  It's the contestant facing this wall of people, and, of course, that's the hundred.  And then they ask these, really, in the beginning, the easiest trivia questions ever,  and people still get them wrong. 
[00:55:00]  Yep.  And they also have some people that they had to cut out that I spoke to.  Those are the fun ones.  Real morons?  Well, not really, but it's like one guy, we didn't know it, and he was a really nice guy.  They didn't put it on the air, but he had a voice box.  Oh, no.  Yeah, and I felt bad.  And he started talking to me, and he sounded like one of those guys.  Hi, Bob.  How are you?  Hi.  And he was a survivor, a cancer survivor, a really nice guy. 
[00:55:30]  And we went out afterward and smoked a couple of packs of cigarettes.  There you go.  I'm like, come on, Bob.  That was really starting to make me sick, but all of a sudden, he turned it around.  You know what he does, this guy?  He says he's a biker.  He was a biker with one of those things because he was a survivor.  And I was like, you know, don't want your muffler exposed if you've got a problem.  No.  This is why.  Everyone thinks a cop is coming up behind him because he whistles when he's riding his bike.  You just clean the pool with it if you hook it up.  Clean the pool. 
[00:56:00]  This is why we'll never be on network TV or any TV, for that matter, because I would do  the voice box show.  I would have the contestants, the voice box guy, and the whole hundred, the mob.  We'd all have to have voice boxes, and I would be the host that just openly laughs at everybody.  Right.  And you know what's great about it?  You don't really need a buzzer.  It's like.  No, you just got.  What was that sound you made when you came back from the break?  What was that sound?  Oh, I forgot already.  We all blocked it out like childhood insights. 
[00:56:30]  He makes so many.  It was like a busy signal.  It was like.  Yeah.  I was trying to.  That was it.  I was trying to come up with the new sound of the Opie and Anthony show.  The current one is by old Jimmy Norton.  You want to hear the sound that everyone knows?  Please.  All right.  Is it the.  Frankus.  Oh.  Frankus.  We're trying to think of the most horrid, irritating noise, and so far that's it.  And the arrangement of the letters that spell Frankus is just annoying. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, well, try being on stage and having some fat kid yell that at you.  And by the way, to the fat kid in the cellar that critiqued my set last night, I hope you  fell into a pothole and cracked your neck.  Big fan, but you were awesome.  Well, not awesome.  I've seen you a lot better.  Really?  Oh.  What a bastard.  Slap his fat, livery lips.  Should have.  Hope you're dead.  A lot of people don't understand when you go to the cellar, you get to see all these  comics trying out new stuff.  Yeah.  You know, it's like Michael.  It's a privilege.  Michael Jordan at his home court just trying some new shots.  He's not going to take it to the main stadium until he's got it mastered. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  I'm doing the HBO Comedy Festival.  That's not really.  Yes.  And Jim Norton is going to do it with me.  I'm doing it with Jamie Kennedy on the early show, but the late show is the dirty show  with Caesars on the November 17th, and Jim Norton and Jeff Ross and a couple other people  are going to be on the late, dirty show with me.  Cool.  I think we're on in Vegas.  I'm not really sure.  We are.  All right.  Yeah.  Hi, Vegas.  Oh, you are coming to it now?  No.  We're actually broadcast, XM as well as CBS. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  I know that because I got an email yesterday from one guy that said, everyone in Vegas hates  you.  I was like, thank you, Mr. Representative of everyone in Vegas.  That's enough to get you on a plane.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob, now that we're friends, can you fly me out to the Vegas show?  Whatever you need.  I'm going to have a guy pick you up.  He's got a voice box.  On the Saget jet, I'm sure the network's going to be giving you.  A couple more, one versus 100, and Bob will have to be added to the list of people that  used to call our show.  Another hit show.  Jesus Christ, this guy. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  He took me out for a New York junket, and all he did was give me a FedEx sticker.  I stuck it to my ass, and then Gilbert Gray picked me up.  Hey, when's the show on again, by the way?  Is it every Friday?  This Friday.  I thought it was going to be on 8 o'clock, but I read that it might be on at 9 o'clock  because they're so excited about it.  9 o'clock a better time?  I don't know.  I think 8 o'clock is the old full house time spot.  That's why I used to walk around with a dust buster acting all gay.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  Oh, you were adorable.  Whatever.  Acting. 
[00:59:00]  What's what I like to call acting?  Acting like I love guys.  Bob, the only thing I hated about 1 vs. 100 was Jeopardy, dude.  Oh, you didn't like him?  Oh, I hate that guy.  But he got all dressed up for it.  Mr. Know-it-all.  He was nice.  Oh, the guy that I'd like.  What's his name?  Jennings something?  Ken Jennings?  Yeah.  Peter Jennings.  Peter Jennings.  No.  No, that wouldn't be him.  Well, that would be on my show.  Bring out the corpse.  It's time to play.  Actually, that would be really good to have everyone's deceased, all 100 of them. 
[00:59:30]  Just dead people.  Just staring at you and you get nothing done.  And the center square is the crypt keeper from HBO.  Various states of decomposing.  Hey, you want to explain 1 vs. 100 for the new listeners or the people that didn't check  it out yet?  It's 100 people.  They're all contestants.  It's kind of like Millionaire.  It's kind of a little bit like You Bet Your Life where I could talk to them.  And the guy next to me, if he wins, then they get nothing.  And if they win, then they split the money that he lost. 
[01:00:00]  You can't explain it.  You really have to watch it.  Which is good.  It's not bad.  People really liked it.  I was really happy about it.  What was the question?  Man, I didn't realize you were calling today.  I would have been more prepared.  Oh, the size of Martha Stewart's uterus?  It was one question.  You can't get this question wrong.  It was so easy.  And then they reveal the answers and 10, 12 people got it wrong out of 100.  The professor on Gilligan's Island couldn't make a bra, couldn't make a radio out of 
[01:00:30]  Mrs. Howe's IUD.  I've never heard that one.  Oh, no.  Not put quite that way.  Yeah, one out of 100, you know, I don't know, tissue scars, something.  Is it a, it must be a pain in the ass to get 100 people organized, though, on that set.  They have really good producers.  They did it pretty quick.  And as soon as, like, say, the contestant loses and 60 people are, like, taken out, they've  got to replace them.  So, in the same show, they've got to, like, replace all those people.  There's no elevators.  And then is there, like, an annoying person that's like, I've got to wet. 
[01:01:00]  Well, the problem is they've got to pee, so I want them to put, like, portatoities in.  Oh, so they can just sit on a pot.  Yeah, they just sit their crap in the hole.  Just throw in bedpans.  By the way, if they're on national television and they get it wrong, they end up crapping  themselves anyway.  You know, so if somebody's, like, projectile, like, diarrhea or incontinent, it just goes  right down a tube.  Oh, that would be wonderful.  I want to get someone that can't fit in the cubicle in there. 
[01:01:30]  That's what I want.  One of the people you're talking about.  Yeah, fatty pig fatties.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get it right in there.  The guy from Seven, that guy.  Yeah, big 600-pounder.  Were you on the dating game?  Yeah, I was on it twice.  One time I won and one time I lost.  And the time I won, they sent us the winning trip was to Guatemala.  Guatemala.  Right.  And they had a civil war there that week.  Yeah, that was like, what year could that have been?  God, early 80s or something.  Yeah, so there were, like, communists fighting over there. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it was like the Contra, like landing.  Yeah.  And you could go on the date, but you'd have to crawl on your belly under barbed wire.  Did you have a chaperone?  You could have to play with a chaperone and they'd shoot all three of you.  Did you wind up having any action with the girl or?  No, I never went out with her.  I met her and I did see her a couple times after that, but nothing really happened.  I was, at the time, dating my girlfriend who became my wife, who became my ex-wife.  Is that, that's something, so you go on the dating game, you win, but you, did you barely 
[01:02:30]  see each other on the trip?  Yeah, the chaperone keeps you apart.  They're like a giant condom.  They just C-block the whole thing.  The C-blocker, yeah.  I would think that's what they gotta do, though.  You're pretty much complete strangers and they send you to a third world country.  Yeah.  And with the chaperone who probably looks like Wally Cox.  You could have just ravaged her, shot her in the head and said the commies did it.  Well, if your chaperone looked like Wally Cox, you could have brought Brando along.  It could have been a very interesting date.  They liked each other.  Yeah.  They probably played for Quacky or Yahtzee. 
[01:03:00]  And then who'd you lose to?  Anyone famous?  When you lost?  No, it was weird.  These two guys, I don't know who the guys were.  I can't imagine.  But the girl was cute and that one I lost.  And they brought you around and you have to get the little kiss on the cheek and a pat  on the back.  No matter what.  She actually let me pop a zit on her back.  Who were the two guys on the show when you won?  Bono and Bianchi?  Yeah, exactly.  One of them had lipstick on his hand.  But it was weird because you feel rejected.  You walk around, you're behind a partition the whole time. 
[01:03:30]  You think you were clever on the TV and all they did was get medical insurance paid for.  It was like all the guys.  A lot of people did that show.  Like Tom Selleck did it.  Yeah.  Arnold did it.  Yeah.  John Ritter.  That's right.  John Ritter, yeah.  He was good.  I don't like when nice, funny people go.  It's much better when, like, for a while, Hollywood Squares, I just thought God was going,  you know, Charlie Weaver to block.  You know, he just kept taking them, Paul Wynn.  Every one of them just kept going, you know.  Oh, that was a great show when they all started dying off like that. 
[01:04:00]  Are you ready to laugh?  The squares, everyone's in rectangles because they're shaped like coffins.  That's what I think.  Rip takes the square.  Rip Tamer, I think he's doing good.  He's not dead yet.  No, he was just in, what, the Jackass movie.  He's funny, actually.  He's, like, hooked up with those guys somehow.  Yeah, his hair looks real.  Oh, yeah, that toupee and that whole over-the-top gay thing where they're throwing the confetti. 
[01:04:30]  Yep.  Oh, okay, we get it.  Hey, there's a girl.  Help us out here, Bob.  Barbara from Cleveland wants to be in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Barbara.  Hey there, Babs.  You're on with Bob Saget, Barbara.  How are you, Barbara?  Hello.  How are you doing?  I'm sorry if you're embarrassed at all by any of this.  Why did you call in, honey?  I was hoping to be in the contest.  What's the name of the contest?  What is it?  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty. 
[01:05:00]  We love when the fatties say it.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  And what are you tipping the scales at, dear?  It's a lot.  What are you up to?  What are the contests up to yet?  God, you sound fat.  We're up to 430 pounds.  Ooh.  Do you beat that?  Possibly.  When was the last time you weighed yourself, and what was it?  About that.  About that.  About that, yeah.  So do you gain weight fast? 
[01:05:30]  Do I do what?  Do you gain weight quickly?  Can you eat stuff and get fatter, like within a week?  Yes.  I wouldn't do it on purpose, but yeah.  Well, how about for about 4,500 bucks?  Yeah, I could probably do that.  Here's a way to judge it.  What circus animal have you most often been mistaken as?  I don't.  Uh-huh.  Um, hippo?  Could short round ride you out of a jungle?  Yeah, I'm a jungle hippo.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Stick with the Indiana Jones.  Well, why don't you, you know, maybe you could, have you seen a specialist?  I can't hear you.  Look at network TV, Bob.  Yeah.  I'm trying to help.  Trying to help.  Yeah.  Bob, please, we don't need your help.  I don't need a specialist.  What is that?  We don't need network TV, Bob.  Yeah, we don't want network TV.  We don't want another successful show, Bob.  We want the aristocrats, Bob.  We want garbage, Bob.  That's right.  Bob's trying to have his segment removed from the aristocrats. 
[01:06:30]  So what do you want me to do?  Tell her to go eat a live goat?  Yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  If you want, that's fine.  Well, Barbara, what's the problem?  What's the biggest thing you've ever eaten?  The biggest thing, I don't eat big things.  I eat a lot of little things.  A lot of little ones.  Caramel corn.  Children.  A lot of caramel corn.  Goobers.  Things like that.  What's your poison?  Entenmann's?  I just tend to take things and make them big on my butt.  What is your snack of choice?  Yeah.  Have you ever eaten?  My snack of choice? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Something chocolate.  Donuts or candy?  Candy, probably.  Can I ask you a question?  Do you ever notice people looking at you when you eat uncomfortably?  Like, I don't like, if I see somebody really fat eating, sometimes I want to look at them.  I know they're going to see how much I hate their guts, so I can't look at them.  Do you notice people looking at you or looking away when you're eating?  I don't know if they're looking or not.  Probably looking.  Yeah, they're looking.  Believe me, they're looking.  You don't really hate their guts, though.  Hey, Bert from Philly says her voice sounds like it's trying to eat itself. 
[01:07:30]  Great.  Have you ever, can I ask you a question?  Have you ever gone into a petting zoo and just thought about this, grab them a sheep?  No.  Just start eating an animal right there in a petting zoo?  Or have you ever walked into a petting zoo and had to slap children's hands away and  say, not me?  Anyone want to do it?  As they take palms full of seeds and put them up to your mouth.  Would you like some grain?  No, none of the above.  See, I'm not even like this. 
[01:08:00]  I'm just trying to make these boys happy.  I know.  You know how I feel about you.  Okay, yeah, you love me.  You ever tip over an SUV with your nose and try to rip two small children out of the  bottom?  You ever stood in front of a train?  Just about a bus?  No, don't even.  Don't.  I'm sorry.  Bob can't help himself.  He's got to.  He's got a Hit Network show.  He's trying.  I can hear him trying to hold back.  Like, look, man, this is not good for my image.  But he knows funny. 
[01:08:30]  He can't help himself.  Just remember, Bob, 12.8 million viewers last Friday.  Yeah, but none of them have ever laid in front of a plane and stopped it.  Oh, my.  Barbara, so are we going to see you or what?  Yeah, how do I do this?  You got to get down here or maybe we could work out something with the station we're on  in Cleveland, K-Rock.  With the Cleveland station, maybe a video link.  Can I come out to New York?  Huh?  I can't come out to New York.  You don't have to.  Well, maybe you could go down to the Cleveland station and they'll help us out, get some 
[01:09:00]  video of you, and they'll weigh you.  Okay.  Hold on the line, Barbara.  Thanks.  You know, I don't know what to say.  Yes, you do.  Barbara.  You just choose not to at this point in your career.  You think she's ever used a piece of roofing tile as a cookie?  I mean, just eat, like, you know, home products, gone into Home Depot and just started chewing  on a board.  Eating posts?  Yeah, wood.  All right, Bob, we got to take a break.  I'm going to take off because that's what I do.  One versus 100, Friday night at 8 or 9. 
[01:09:30]  Did we figure that out?  It says 9 o'clock on this sheet.  Oh, it says 9 o'clock?  Okay.  But then again, it says at 9 p.m. Eastern time last night, which meant last week, so  that might be wrong.  Yeah, it might be 8 o'clock, but it might be 9 o'clock.  I apologize.  They're excited about it, so I don't know what the hell they're doing.  Bob, it's my job to say that I love everything that the guests do, but I got to tell you,  I really like this show.  I really, I actually really appreciate that.  I really like it.  You know what?  I got to tell you, I like it, too.  It's really weird.  It's weird.  It's like it gets better, too. 
[01:10:00]  It gets less, you know, less drama.  It kind of gets funnier and then has the drama, too.  I think it's a simple show.  It's like Millionaire, but standing up so I can pee down my catheter.  It's really good.  Check it out for yourself.  It's 1 versus 100 on NBC Friday night.  Will you be in it all before then or no?  Before I see you in November?  Well, you know what?  I'm going to actually, I want her number, and I want to go trampolining.  I want to jump off of a high tree and land on her.  Bounce on that gut.  And send the tickets for the Vegas show to us, okay? 
[01:10:30]  I will.  I will.  Airfare included, of course.  First class, of course.  First class, yes.  We don't fly coach anymore.  I'm going to get you guys out there, and I'm going to pay for everything.  Maybe not this year.  Yeah, we'll see how it goes.  Thanks so much for everything, guys.  All right.  Bob Saget.  We'll talk to you soon.  He's just, we love him.  Bab.  We love him.  Another hit show, the son of a bitch.  Jesus Christ.  He came in because of the aristocrats, and we all just hit it off, and now he's just a  good friend of the show. 
[01:11:00]  You believe it.  And 1 versus 100 is really, really a good game show.  And if you like Deal or No Deal, check it out.  Roland just came in and said it's 9 o'clock at night.  Roland?  9 o'clock?  Roland, just give him the money.  Yeah, maybe Roland can...  What's up, Roland?  It's 1 versus 100 is at 9 o'clock.  What night?  Friday.  Okay.  Friday.  9.  Roland took care of us, by the way.  The director of The Bridge coming in tomorrow?  Coming in tomorrow, and they're going to messenger over, screen her copies this morning.  I don't know if we talked about it on this part of the Opie and Anthony show, but there's  this movie, a documentary we talked about about a year ago, and we thought they squashed 
[01:11:30]  the film because San Francisco is not happy.  Matter of fact, Jimmy's going to be in San Francisco this weekend doing his stand-up.  Maybe he'll be in the sequel.  Doesn't go well.  Some people show up Friday night, The Bridge 2, Mediocre Comic Jumps.  Basically, this guy's...  What they find is a Breathe Right strip in the water.  This guy set up a camera on the Golden Gate Bridge for how long?  Was it a year?  About that, I believe, because I'm not too sure.  You don't know.  For a long time.  It was for a long time. 
[01:12:00]  And he caught a bunch of people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge because it's something  that happens all the time.  And San Francisco tries to kind of brush it under the rug and like, let's not talk about  this, but it's happening a lot, and this guy did a whole documentary on it.  You actually see these people going over the rail and getting ready to jump and stuff.  Well, that's what we saw in the preview.  I don't know if they're showing video of them actually jumping.  Oh, I hear they do, but they got it under the pretense.  They got these permits under the pretense that it was just going to be this kind of time-lapse  thing of the bridge.  Right.  Traffic patterns.  Yeah, traffic patterns, things like that. 
[01:12:30]  And what they got was what they were looking for, people jumping off the bridge because they  had heard there was a pretty high suicide rate from the Golden Gate Bridge.  And the bridge authority in San Francisco tried to have this film squashed because they  didn't want people seeing this, maybe copycatting people jumping.  And I guess that didn't work.  It went through, and now the film's going to be released.  And the chilling part was you see people contemplating.  They don't show anybody jumping, but you do see people stepping over the railing. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  But you see them standing there for a minute, and you know that they're going over, am  I going to do this or am I not going to do this?  Or they're just picturing whatever it is that's causing them to want to kill themselves.  And then you can almost see them just give in and step over the railing.  Yeah, that is the creepiest part of the preview.  Really, really creepy.  And then they talk to the families of some of these people.  Well, they're trying to find out what these people are about and what their wives are  about.  What drove them to it.  Right.  His first interviews about the movie will be here.  Oh, really?  What?  Because it will be like one of his first interviews.  He's talking about the movie here.  Yeah, man.  This came out of nowhere yesterday.  Now we've got the director coming in tomorrow. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  It's going to be quite a controversial film.  Yeah, it's called The Bridge.  It's opening in New York next weekend or something.  New York next weekend?  Oh, nice.  Wide anywhere?  Open Friday wide.  What's the director's name?  Eric Steele.  Okay.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  We've got Louis C.K. in the house.  We also...  Is Otto here?  All right.  Otto and George are joining the show today.  But we'll get Louis C.K. in next.  He's been waiting in the green room way too long.  So we'll get to him next.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's up? 
[01:14:00]  It's Louis Tuchels Centani.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony Show,  which is to say that we've discovered a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's,  we've enlisted the help of hearing-impaired Chicago reporter Karen Meyer.  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony Show,  which is to say that we've discovered a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  Exactly.  Exactly. So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's, muster up some courage and an ounce of self-control and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:14:30]  Contact Steve at foundrymusic.com. That's Steve at foundrymusic.com.  And remember, be yourself one ticket at a time.  Tourette's Day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  We want to say hi to Chicago once again this morning.  We're obsessed with Chicago.  Gotta be.  Big hi to everyone listening to us on WCKG. 
[01:15:00]  And we're still waiting for Robert Fetter to give us a call and stop hiding behind his column.  Yeah, he's the guy in the Chicago Sun-Times that trashed the show saying it wasn't, we've been on there a month and a half and he's saying like, eh, it's not going to catch on.  He's just a douche.  See, it's not happening just like it wasn't happening for Rover.  Like the guy didn't even give us a chance yet.  And he knows how this radio thing works.  It's way too early.  We know Chicago's going to be tough.  We know.  We know about radio history.  Most shows that syndicate to Chicago don't do well. 
[01:15:30]  We understand that.  But we do think we're going to find our audience in Chicago.  And this guy's already saying, eh, say, say, nothing's happening.  After a month and a half.  Jesus.  Well, you know what, Louie?  Louie C.K. in studio.  You guys can relate to this.  Yep.  These guys that talk out of their asses.  They got a column and they just, you know, they make these massive, well, they just flat out lie is what they do.  And they, because they know the truth.  Like he's saying something that he knows, like he's friends with Mancow, this guy, which is cool.  That's his guy.  Rumor has he went to Mancow's wedding. 
[01:16:00]  I hear he was the flower girl, so.  Okay, that's funny.  That's right.  We're not calling you a traipsing mullet, of course.  We're just joking.  Elbow to the ribs.  That's what I hear.  I hear he was the flower girl at Mancow's wedding.  Because he had to add that in parentheses.  Obviously, the solution is to hire Mancow.  No, the solution is to at least give us a chance before you start with this crap.  How about a ratings book?  How about a ratings book?  Right.  Give us one ratings book that's all ours.  Well, the ratings came out in Chicago, and we're doing nothing. 
[01:16:30]  But it's too early.  This book wasn't ours, really.  We're on even a month of the three months.  I think we're on maybe a month.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe if that.  Maybe.  So, you know.  I was there in Chicago.  You were just in Chicago, Louis?  Yeah, last week.  So we're telling Robert, give us a call.  We'll discuss this.  And he's still hiding.  And this bagot doesn't want to answer his phone.  And we get the pests on the job.  And yesterday, we wound up getting, like, all of his personal information and stuff. 
[01:17:00]  They are the worst.  Five minutes after we mentioned him, I walk over to the PalTalk screen.  I look, and his social security number is up.  Is up there.  And his phone, his home phone number, address, how much taxes he pays in his neighborhood.  Wow.  They are ruthless, and I love them.  Pictures of him as the flower girl.  Right there.  Exactly.  Other than Homeland Security.  They are.  They absolutely are.  Come on, Robert.  Let's go.  Give us a call.  Yeah, just call up.  We've called you.  We've left messages.  You know how to get a hold of us.  Mancow's not even in Chicago. 
[01:17:30]  No.  No, he got kicked off his hometown station.  Yeah, no.  And I did all the radio, and none of it's, I mean, good.  Yeah, there's a lot of.  Hey, Eric and Kathy.  Come on.  Yeah.  Eric and Kathy.  Eric and Kathy.  Come on.  I didn't need to know what was going on.  If you have what we call the hole on the show, any show that includes what we like to call the hole,  she is the fun wrecker of any radio show.  They have tried for years to get a hole on this program, and we finally compromised and got Jimmy Norton. 
[01:18:00]  Because I didn't get the homosexual experiences in my youth.  That's as close to a chick as we're going to get.  That's as close as we're going to get.  But she's the one, you know, you've seen it.  How many shows have you done?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  And they're always, guys.  Yep.  Now, oh, you don't have to be like that.  Just the fun wreckers.  Yep.  Just put the big.  I just picture like the train, an old style train going down the tracks.  Boop, boop, 90, 100 miles an hour. 
[01:18:30]  And then this big, sweaty hand pulling the brake.  That is what a hole's job is.  Sparks flying out of the comedy wheels.  Come on, stop.  There, there it is.  We got some clips of a hole.  Guys, I can't take this.  I got to say you got to stop.  Yeah, do we?  Do we?  They're just there.  You know what they're there.  We're going to balance it out and keep the link.  Yeah, the program directors all think it's a good balance.  No, like women are listening just because somebody says that occasionally.  Yeah, I like listening to that show that offends me as long as somebody occasionally stops it. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  And just kind of curtails it and says, oh.  You know why?  It's a lot like my house.  I have my husband and when his friends come over, I'm the one that goes, guys, coasters now.  Oh.  Ugh.  Boo.  Take her.  Oh, meh.  Take her out in the S.S. Peterson out to Modesto.  Fix that problem.  I'm so sorry.  I'm just trying to help, guys. 
[01:19:30]  That's what radio has become.  That's our professional hole.  Hey, Louie, I was talking about Lucky Louie yesterday with Joel Hollander.  Who's that again?  He runs the radio division for CBS.  A huge fan and he's bummed that the show's off the air.  Well, maybe we should do it as a radio show.  He thought it was the old-time radio.  Yeah.  Down to Peck's guy.  Honey, I'm home.  Yeah, somebody with clunking coconut abs.  You have to do a horse if you're doing Santa Fe.  It's got to be the coconuts.  I don't know why a horse was involved in everything that's on the radio.  Look at here. 
[01:20:00]  A horse is coming, smoking a Lucky Strike cigarette and trampling some Negroes.  Clip clop.  Clip clop.  Clip clop.  He said it was the new Honeymooners.  Oh, that's great.  He said it was the new Honeymooners.  It's also the good stuff that's in common that it's going.  That was like a great compliment, though.  That was like a great compliment because nothing else was really tried like that, like the Honeymooners.  The Honeymooners, brilliant writing. 
[01:20:30]  The acting was great.  Fun, fun cast.  When I started putting the show together, I got the DVD for the Honeymooners and I watched the first one.  I wanted to see how they hit the air.  Same with all the family.  Both shows hit the air like gangbusters.  I wanted to see if they eased in.  What was the first Honeymooners episode?  The first Honeymooners episode is unbelievably classic.  It starts with the wife, with Alice.  Trixie, upstairs, just got a new TV.  Oh, the TV.  Alice has never even had a TV because Ralph is cheap. 
[01:21:00]  That was the first joke is that Ralph is cheap.  Trixie says, give him the old pipe and slippers routine.  The old.  Make him feel good.  So Ralph comes home and she says, hi, dear.  This is the first time you've seen them as a couple together.  She just says, hi, dear.  Welcome home.  And he goes, what's your problem?  He's already on to us.  What do you want something?  And they start screaming at each other.  But yeah, every couple had, you know, on TV thus far had been sweet to each other. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  And they're the first ones.  And you hear the audience explode when he, like they go, oh my God, this is a real couple.  Where people don't say I love you when they walk in the door.  Just screaming at each other, I want to watch Liberace.  Yeah.  What is that?  What is that?  What is that?  That was when she wanted the TV and she's screaming.  You wanted to watch Liberace.  Yeah.  I loved one of the lines in one of them was like, yeah, I got an atomic kitchen.  This place looks like Yucca Flats after the blast.  Yes.  Always just bashing him. 
[01:22:00]  His lack of income.  The crap hole they lived in.  And then the mother comes over and demeans him.  Oh.  Fighting for them.  It's awful.  And he's poor.  He's like, if he was rich and they were doing that, but it's so brutal.  Yeah.  It was great.  So.  I didn't know that was the first show though.  I don't want my, she goes, I don't want my salary to leak out.  She goes, I don't, your salary couldn't drip out.  Couldn't drip out.  Could be the greatest broke line ever.  What a thing to say to a bus driver.  Yeah.  Look, he's not trying.  And that was, that was a great similarity between your show and the honeymoon is, was 
[01:22:30]  that it, the wife wasn't just being bitched at by the husband.  Right.  She like on a lot of the instances got the upper hand on, on Ralph.  Yes.  And Ralph just had to be this schmo that took it.  Exactly.  And that's exactly what you were doing on the show, you know?  Oh, exactly.  The wife is smarter, gets over on you more.  You're trying to pull something over on her and she's 20 steps ahead of you.  Well, and also she's working.  Like it's a common American couple situation now is that guys don't have the pride.  They have too much pride to go get a job that they don't like. 
[01:23:00]  They think it's beneath them to do something that they don't want to do for money.  And women are like, thank God I have the opportunity to do a job and provide.  It's like women don't have that kind of pride.  So they're better.  And guys are like, I'm not doing that.  And she's like, let me at it.  Yeah, yeah, they want to work.  And on a piece of shit like you.  And the relationship with the kid would crack me up.  The lack of real communication between the father and daughter is hysterical. 
[01:23:30]  But it's got to be.  You can't talk baby talk and watch some of these shows and the father is so involved in everything that the small child is saying.  And you're just like, I don't understand this.  No.  This is babble.  Kids are stupid.  Kids are dumb.  They don't talk baby talk either.  They're just rotten little people.  They're not cute.  They just suck.  They're ridiculously stupid.  I looked at the cellar last night.  Louis was on stage.  And I didn't even know you were going to be there. 
[01:24:00]  And he's doing some bit about his kid falling and hitting her head.  And all I knew was I watched for a second.  And the thing is like, you said something, how you get used to it.  Yeah.  And then you think like, oh, she's dead.  All right.  It was like, my kid's dead joke.  And it was just so.  Well, because your kid, you know, when you have a baby, you know, we're on our second one.  So even more, they hit the deck occasionally.  They hit their head, hits pavement.  And it's that sound of like, it sounds like a rock inside of a peach.  Like, oh, you hear tissue like getting destroyed. 
[01:24:30]  And the first couple of times, you're like, oh, it's like your whole body quakes with fear.  But it happens like a hundred times.  After a while, you're like, yeah, well, it's probably dead.  You can't keep reacting like that.  Just after a while, you just get immune to it.  No, because my one daughter pulled the other kid down by the throat.  Grabbed her by the throat.  Grabbed her a baby.  This is a four-year-old.  Grabbed her baby sister by the throat.  Pulls her to the pavement.  And then says, I was trying to help her.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  A lie comes out.  Yeah, immediately.  But while she's doing it.  She's got shitty timing, though.  Like, she's pulling her down and saying it at the same time.  She's like, I'm trying to help her.  And so then she looks at me kind of with this wild grin of like, I just hurt.  I might have killed my sister.  And I think I feel good.  And I'm looking at her like, you suck.  And then the baby stood up and said, I'm sorry.  Oh, Jesus.  Isn't that sad?  That is so sad.  She apologized to us that she almost got killed. 
[01:25:30]  She's like, so we realized that my daughter and I both laughed at her.  I guess the more kids you have.  I don't know.  I don't have any.  I don't want any.  But my girlfriend's sister has three kids now.  The first one, I remember, anywhere they went, she went with disinfectant wipes and set up everything and wiped it down and just looked at contempt with the waitresses who would be like carrying coffee pots too close to the baby and things like that. 
[01:26:00]  And by the third one, that just goes out the window.  It's like they're just picking up toys from out in the street and putting it in their mouths.  You don't care.  No, no.  Like the woman on TV on the Lysol.  I saw a Lysol commercial where she has a ball and she's just dousing it with Lysol so it's drooping and hands it to a kid.  There you go.  By the way, what a real comic I am.  I say to Louis, like, and I give away his punchline.  I didn't mean to do it.  No.  Hey, what about that joke where the two Jews walk into the bar and they own it?  Yeah.  So much for that joke. 
[01:26:30]  Louis has got to go write something new now.  That's how housewives do it with comics.  Hey, let's go to Mike in Yonkers.  He's challenging you guys on the Honeymooners thing.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Mike.  Whoever's saying that that's the first episode for the Honeymooners, it's definitely not the first episode.  It's a bunch of lost episodes.  Oh, we're not talking about the lost ones.  Oh, screw the lost episodes.  There's a reason why they're lost.  And some of those were, like, sketches that were done on, um, yeah.  No, of course, but it's much, listen, the thing was, it's more interesting when I tell the story here to say it was the first one. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  I know I'm fudging it, but who cares?  Everybody who was alive then is dead.  Thank God.  Jackass.  And we got a good laugh out of it.  That's all we care about.  It doesn't matter.  Thanks for spoiling.  Craig on Long Island.  Craig.  Hey, what's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  Hey.  You guys are missing the best out dig ever.  What?  He comes home and he says, I'm the king, Alice.  I'm the king and you're nothing.  And she says, that's right, Ralph.  You're the king of nothing. 
[01:27:30]  Later.  That show still holds up, obviously.  And my favorite episode, he finds a suitcase of money.  Yeah.  In the bus.  It turns out to be counterfeit, but he spends all of it.  Yeah.  So now he's in the hole how much he spent.  Easy come.  That's the best part.  She calls him on it.  He takes him four seconds to process it.  Yeah.  Go through shame and regret, but right to, no, man.  Anger.  That's right. 
[01:28:00]  I spent it.  That's me, baby.  That's right.  I had it and I went with it.  Awesome.  He has to get mad.  Is that the one with the clothes in it?  Where he's like, I'm going to, she's like, well, you can't return those clothes unless the  man knows some elephants that need to work with.  That's right.  She was just a vicious, awful, dominating bitch.  Talking about how fat he was, yeah.  Really well, too.  Let's go to Jason the trucker.  Jason.  Hey, Louis CK, the funniest part I thought is when I seen you told your wife that your 
[01:28:30]  daughter was an asshole, and the next time I told my three-year-old he was an asshole  to his face, I thought it was the funniest part.  Let's go, guys.  Let me tell you.  That probably got dumped out of.  So basically, Louis inspired this man to tell his child to her face that she was an a-hole.  Yeah.  That's nice.  That's what he got from the show.  That's nice.  My daughter, she wouldn't know what that meant.  It wouldn't matter if I said that to her.  Then they'd just start using it around the school and their friends.  Yeah.  My little, the 15-month-old said, you got to be careful. 
[01:29:00]  Like, my wife, we went for Christmas to her parents' place, and there's somebody that  I shouldn't now, whoever's listening.  He's going to know the story.  All right.  She called somebody privately.  You know how when you're at Christmas holidays, you're all having a great time.  Yeah.  But then when you go in the separate rooms, you just say horrible things about everybody  who just hugged and kissed.  So she said, what a C-word about this woman.  And then the little babies walked around.  What a C-word.  What a C-word.  Just singing it for the rest of the vacation. 
[01:29:30]  How adorable.  Very sweet.  A little sing-songy.  Yeah.  Really nice.  That'd be a great kids video with the little red ball bouncing over the same line.  Let's go to Dave in Maine.  Dave.  Dave, we're hanging with Louis C.K.  What's up?  Come on in, Dave.  Hi, Dave.  What's up, Dave?  Callers are a little bit...  Spit it out, faggot.  They're a little slow.  Dave, well, he wants to know what was it like working with Jim on Lucky Louis there.  Jim is hilarious because he works so hard. 
[01:30:00]  He wants so badly for it to be good.  Yeah.  So, I mean, you know, he seems like a careless jerk.  Cutie.  Yeah, cutie.  Sure.  Comes off like he's just going to come in and piss all over the place.  Yeah.  And you kind of figure when you work with comics, you're going to have to rein them in and they're  going to go, can't I just say it different every time?  Like, comedians are usually idiots on a set.  Yeah, I'm just going to riff.  Yeah.  But he would very respectfully be like, excuse me, may I try saying, you know, blow your dad 
[01:30:30]  or something like that.  He would very respectfully ask to say awful, disgusting things at the next take.  But he really worked with his acting coach, Bob Krakauer, every day.  And he was, no, a very sincere and very hardworking guy.  And I thought he was great on the show.  I liked him.  I thought his character was hilarious.  Krakauer did a great job.  But after seeing my performance, I should have worked with Copperfield or somebody else  who could have really done bug eyes.  Yeah, but it's funny. 
[01:31:00]  It's good.  It was old-fashioned TV acting.  I thought it was great.  Old-fashioned TV acting.  That's what I think it was.  I think that was a compliment.  I don't like the new realist kind of, like, mumbling jerks on TV.  They're not funny.  Who wants to watch that?  Like the old school.  Yeah.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Yeah, exactly.  That's awesome.  Let's stop right there for a second.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  All right.  C.K. in the house.  Are we promoting anything, Louie?  I'm with the Trump Marina on Saturday night.  Very nice.  In Atlantic City.  Trumpmarina.com. 
[01:31:30]  That's right.  Saturday night.  And you've got a fan in Charlotte because they're, like, plug Louis C.K. Charlotte performance.  That's right.  And next weekend, I'm in Charlotte.  Comedy Zone.  Comedy Zone.  Okay.  But this weekend?  This weekend, Saturday night.  Trump Marina.  Trump Marina.  All right.  We continue with Louis C.K. and we've got Otto and George.  And Nina's here?  Yeah.  Nina Harley.  We didn't know if she was coming in or not.  No one got a confirmation.  Jimmy did a sex scene with Nina.  Really?  Well, I don't know.  You had sex with her?  Not sex, but it was a-  We'll get into it after the break.  You were in a sex scene?  Kind of.  And if we don't talk about this story, we're just stupid. 
[01:32:00]  The two guys in the bathroom?  Yeah.  With the thing at the bowling alley?  Yeah.  It's a horrific story.  But then you've got the other story.  About the woman in New Orleans.  Ah, that's another one.  We've got to decide which one is more horrific.  It's a love story.  One's a love story.  Well, they could both be love stories, actually.  Yeah, we'll get into that after the break.  Huh?  Is that the one that you were talking about?  Is the guy, like, something wrong with the guy?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's not a vegetable, Jimmy. 
[01:32:30]  That should be addressed.  This guy wished it was a vegetable.  We'll talk about that next.  It's the One virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest began like a stampede of hungry rhinos.  But now it more closely resembles a sleepy, winded elephant.

[01:33:30]  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's right, it is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got a full house today.  Louis C.K. doing great for us.  And now we've got to say hi to Otto and George as well.  Hi, good morning.  We had Bob Saget call in.  And now I'm hearing Jerry Springer's going to call in, by the way, Anthony.  He's still on Dancing with Stars or Dancing with the Stars or whatever the hell the show's called. 
[01:34:00]  None of us even watch it.  But we're obsessed with making sure he continues on the show.  Yeah, the goof factor.  He said if he wins, he's going to dedicate it to the Opie and Anthony Show.  If he wins, he will say that on the air.  Yeah, in case you don't know what's going on, we had an interview with Jerry Springer about three weeks ago.  And he was on this show.  And we told him that our pest, the One Pest, will vote for him now every week.  And he begged us.  He said, guys, please do not do this.  My knees hurt.  I went on as just to have a little fun and maybe get some exposure. 
[01:34:30]  You know, he knew that he was the goof factor.  That's awesome.  All these shows have the goof factor.  Someone that obviously can't skate or dance.  And Jerry Springer was that guy.  And he goes, please, guys, don't.  I want to just go home at this point.  That was three weeks ago.  But we think he was just being humble.  If he does win and doesn't dedicate it to the Opie and Anthony Show, the same pests that made him win, oh, my God.  They will never let him live it down.  Here's a radio segue. 
[01:35:00]  Speaking of can't skate, can't dance, what's going on with Paul McCarty and Heather Mills?  Yeah, we'll move on to that in one second.  But from Dancing with the Stars last night, this is what happened, okay, with Jerry Springer.  Joey and Edita.  Jerry and Kim.  So it was up to these two pairs, obviously, who was going to get voted off the show.  Okay.  On our sixth week of competition, the couple with the lowest score and therefore leaving right now. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  The drama.  Who?  None of you.  And here's why.  In light of the early departure of Sarah and Tony and two couples leaving the competition last week,  we've considered all the options.  We think it's most fair that everyone, everyone move on to the next round.  Know what I'm thinking? 
[01:36:00]  What?  Jerry got more votes to stay, but they didn't want to kick off that other couple.  It would have been too far.  So they used an excuse because someone else had to leave the show because her nanny's banging her husband.  That's scandalous.  That's scandalous thing that's going on.  Why would you have to leave the show for that?  Yeah.  Anthony, you watch too much television.  Open the door and go for a walk.  There's a world out there, you creep.  I can't help it.  And then just a little more audio and then we'll move on.  The judges' score for this week will be added to the judges' scores for next week. 
[01:36:30]  The viewer votes for this week will be added to the viewer votes for next week.  We'll then combine the totals in our normal manner at the very end of next week's show.  And then the couple with the lowest overall total will be eliminated.  A rocket science.  And every point given by the judges last night will count.  Our couples are being judged on their performances over two shows.  Joey and Edita and Jerry and Kim have some serious work to do if they're going to pull themselves out of the bottom two next week, Jerry. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, Jerry was just annoyed.  He's like, just pull it.  Someone who saw the show, actually.  Rodney in Texas, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rodney.  I am pissed off with you guys.  Y'all got me hooked on that goddamn show.  I mean, dang show.  My fault.  That agony in his eyes.  Yeah, everyone's saying the agony in his eyes.  It's so great because nobody wins except for you guys.  Yeah.  If he wins, he hates you.  America hates you. 
[01:37:30]  The viewers hate you.  He's up there on that stage.  We just win.  The greatest thing in the world.  He's on that stage knowing what's going on.  Yeah.  And he's rolling his eyes in agony last night like, no, guys, stop, please.  You've got to make him win it.  You've got to make him win it because then the whole point of the entire show is you guys.  Right.  It's all about us and the pest.  We just ruined everything.  We're trying, but the judges' votes count for something as well.  The judges' votes count for 50%, and then the listener vote counts for 50%.  Yeah.  So our listeners really have been pounding it to override the judges. 
[01:38:00]  We get calls and emails from the listeners that, like, I've voted 10 times, voted 20 times.  They only allow you to vote 10 times.  You've got to use that power other ways.  Yeah.  Like local races.  For good.  Little small towns have your guys move there and, like, jerk as the aldermen.  Just win elections.  Yeah.  Sort of take over the whole country, maybe.  Just in time.  Little ways.  Well, the ONA pest, they're getting the job done. 
[01:38:30]  They're voting every week for Jerry Springer.  ABC.com.  Help us out.  Join the fight.  Make Jerry win the whole thing.  He hates us.  Oh, wobbly neat bastard.  All right.  And, well, we'll go to Heather Mills now there, Jimmy.  Heather Mills hit Sir Paul McCartney with the worst accusations yet.  Jerry Pinacoli has the breaking couples news.  Paul McCartney shooting down domestic abuse allegations.  Today, the Beatles legend fires back on Extra over the explosive new claims from his estranged wife, Heather Mills. 
[01:39:00]  In 13 pages of court papers, Heather alleges Paul stabbed her in the arm with a broken wine glass, shoved her when she was pregnant, and grabbed her around the throat.  In a statement issued through his lawyers, Paul says he wants to protect his children and not comment publicly.  But that in court, quote, our client will be defending these allegations vigorously and appropriately.  A source close to Paul today accuses Heather of leaking the court papers to hurt Paul's reputation. 
[01:39:30]  No more me shell my bell.  You know, when they always say that thing where he shoved her when she was pregnant.  Yeah.  You're pregnant for nine months.  What, you're supposed to not shove somebody for nine months?  It's like almost a year you're supposed to, like, oh, hands off the beauty queen while she's got a baby in her.  Oh, the last trimester is the most important.  Yeah, it could have been real early on.  She pissed him off, a little push.  Right after she took the test and he shoved her.  Shoved me.  Why didn't you believe that this is true? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, who else wants to believe that he's just a maniac behind closed doors?  I'm totally buying it.  You're buying it?  Yeah, yeah.  I have to.  Just to hear one of his Louvre songs.  Let me hear a Louvre song.  And just picture him just slapping her around.  I love you with a wine glass.  Yeah.  You whole.  Bring me a wine glass.  You're a one-legged bitch.  She was on Larry King years ago and she was saying that she didn't know who Paul McCartney was and she fell in love with him just as a guy.  Oh, sure.  It's like, come on. 
[01:40:30]  A liar.  He's a beetle.  Yeah, I know.  He's also so good looking.  He's, you know.  Yeah.  He looks like an older woman now.  He does.  Definitely.  He's like 65 and he has hair like Christy McNichol in 1978.  You can't be attracted to him.  Yeah.  I guess.  But every time that anybody does, whenever they do court papers publicly, it's always awful.  Oh, yeah.  It's never like, you know, he told a boring story.  And so I'm divorcing him.  Yeah, it's all the awful stuff.  Yeah, no one's going to remember that.  One night she sat there and just talked about a new rug. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  No, it's almost like you hear the lawyer saying to her, well, you can say stuff like shoved  you when you were pregnant, stabbed you with a wine glass.  It's like, yeah.  They do.  They kind of coach the girls, too.  They probably hand you a menu.  Yeah, just circle what you want.  Like your wine glass is worth like $50,000.  Like you're ordering fireworks back in the day.  Circle an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert.  I'll take a wine glass to start and then I'd like a no stump operation for dessert. 
[01:41:30]  That's the best one.  Yeah, what was the no stump?  Do you stump operation again?  She wanted to get an operation on her stump, and my new idol said no because it will interfere  with my vacation plan.  Yeah.  Why is she getting her stump?  Isn't that a hopeless cause?  I know.  Get her stump operated on?  Unless they're putting a, grafting a lizard tail onto it and have that thing grow.  I want to get a bottle opener on my stump.  What could they possibly do?  What's the improvement?  Anything they do is just going to make it shorter. 
[01:42:00]  I got to get my stump.  I know.  You're not getting an operation on your stump?  On your stump?  Your stump.  I got to go to Maui.  You better get your...  Well, Heather's friend speaks out here.  Oh, no.  Today, in an extra exclusive, Heather's friend and American publicist Michelle Elizabeth reacts  to the accusation.  She did not leak anything, and she wouldn't.  Otherwise, she would have come to me.  So, we had to ask, if this alleged abusive behavior was going on, why did Heather stay? 
[01:42:30]  All you need is love.  That's what she thought.  Wow.  All you need is love.  He used my stump to roll over some pizza dough.  I don't even like pizza.  They're all in Europe.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Married to a Beatle.  She hit the lotto anyway.  Of course, she did.  That's it.  No prenup, right?  He's as dumb as they come.  He has had no prenup?  No prenup, and he had a kid with her. 
[01:43:00]  Oof.  Yeah, I see.  Her kids should just kill him.  I mean, his kids should kill him, because that's the thing that hurt.  Well, his older kids hated Heather Mills from the beginning.  They're probably older than she is.  Of course.  They're probably older than she is.  Trying to sleep in here and clunk, clunk at night as she gets up for a midnight snack.  Parrots flying all over the place.  Terrible.  Woodpecker going off on her leg.  You want to hear Lady McCartney real fast?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sure. 
[01:43:30]  This is Brother Joe.  Maybe not.  Or not.  E-Rock.  Fix it.  What did you do?  Run.  Run and fix it.  Yeah, something's going on.  We'll try it.  We'll try it.  You incompetent.  There it is.  Sorry.  You roll.  Lady McCartney, she used to have two feet.  Plain to see your lower half's income's lead. 
[01:44:00]  Saved lots of money.  Got a great excuse.  Can't have price on pedicures, boots and shoes.  Every night she takes on for prosthetics.  Hops in circles when she tries to run.  Yes, she only has to tie one shoelace.  She has a stub.  Lady McCartney always has a patch. 
[01:44:30]  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Stump, stump, stump, stump.  Stump, stump, stump, stump, stump.  Stump, stump, stump, stump, stump.  There's no worse word.  Stump, stump, stump, stump.  Yeah, there's no nice stump.  I'm going to go for that.  Stump.  She has a stub. 
[01:45:00]  Where your leg ends.  Lady McCartney.  You no longer have a foot you have to stomp, you idiot.  It's the rate this time I'm chewing on your leg.  Tuesday afternoon, she's looking sexy.  Then I lift the skirt and see that stump.  Stump.  Close my eyes and fantasize while effing. 
[01:45:30]  She has a stub.  Lady McCartney.  Or should I say Eileen?  How you gonna curtsy when you meet the queen?  Oh, it's just going on way too long.  All right, George, relax.  What is that, Alan Sherman?  The guy sucks.  That Nina Hartley backstage, she's got a book to promote about her days in pornography called 
[01:46:00]  All My Aching Cunt.  Jesus.  George is surly.  Why are you so surly, George?  It's song and I'm late too long.  That is the medical term, stump, right?  It's not like some nice...  It should be a nicer word.  It's like, what's her name?  Pamela, who plays my wife on the show, who's actually very funny.  She was talking about how medical advances, they can take the retina of an eagle and transplant 
[01:46:30]  it to another eagle.  Really?  But for like a walker, they steal the cut open tennis balls, all they got?  Like this.  Because it's not important.  You see those every day, yeah.  Even a rich, like a millionaire, has got his cut open...  Yeah.  With the tennis balls.  Tennis balls.  On the end of the walker.  And what is that?  Yeah, is there a medical terminology for the tennis ball?  Nobody cares.  Nobody cares after a while.  No.  About old people.  I've seen the old folks, though, that really have the fancy ones with the hand brakes on  them and everything.  But they still got the tennis balls.  Wheels and the tennis balls.  They still got the tennis balls. 
[01:47:00]  Hey, we were going to move on, but Danny brought to my attention that this next clip  about Heather Mills and Paul McCartney is really good.  All right.  Danny's putting himself out there.  Well, he's claiming something else.  Listen to this.  Well, Paul McCartney once wrote a song, P.S.  I Love You.  Mr. McCartney could pin a follow-up, P.S.  I Didn't Beat You.  Heather and Paul...  What?  That was...  Unfathomable.  Wow.  At number two, Heather is now publicly accusing her soon-to-be former husband of abuse.  The London Evening Standard published information they claim was leaked from the Mills-McCartney 
[01:47:30]  divorce papers, which include these shocking...  Here we go.  Listen to this.  Paul beat her.  He stabbed her with a broken wine bottle during one of the attacks.  Paul is an alcoholic and a heavy drug user.  And even that Paul tried to stop her from breastfeeding their daughter, telling her, quote,  they are my breasts.  Paul, imagine, has quickly retaliated via his lawyers saying, quote, he recognizes that  the only correct form for his response is in the current divorce proceedings. 
[01:48:00]  Our client will be defending these allegations vigorously and appropriately.  Mills-Peep say the court documents are highly confidential and refuse to confirm if the leaked info is genuine.  All right.  Didn't deny it, though.  How do you not deny that?  Just get out and say, look, whatever this... whoever leaked this, whatever it's... not true.  There you go.  The moment you...  Yeah.  So did you stab her with a wine glass?  Well, you know...  This is all going to come out in court. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, I bet you did fine stab...  I'd rather have this come out in court in sealed documents where no one will ever hear the truth  than me saying no here in the public forum where it's going to make every news story.  Yeah, where it's the only place it actually matters.  Yeah, that only matters in the public eye.  He didn't deny the claim or anything?  No, no.  No denial of anything.  Maybe he figures by not even commenting on it, it's so absurd, you know.  Sometimes that works, but not in this case. 
[01:49:00]  In this case, he should just...  Well, wouldn't she get a pile of money without accusing him of anything just by being married to him?  I mean, maybe there's some truth.  He already offered...  More money.  A pretty nice payday.  Now you get more money.  See, how much could he lose, really, if it's all true?  Like, how much could he really lose?  Like, $10 million out of...  More than that.  Way more than that.  Way more than that.  Way more.  Probably hundreds.  It's still splitting millions.  At least a hundred million.  At least a hundred million.  She has a kid now.  It would be great if he just went, that's right, I did.  She's a cunt.  Did it all. 
[01:49:30]  What do you want from me?  Spend five minutes with her, you'd stab her with her.  Have you gotten your hand, mate?  Hand, mate.  God.  Sorry for saying that word.  Sorry, there's a guy around the corner there that has a button.  Takes care of that.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Hopefully.  Although, when we got fired last time, the same guy that's on the button now was on the button.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy that was supposed to save us that day.  Yeah, CBS.  It's like hiring John Carr to babysit your daughter. 
[01:50:00]  Put her in a little cowboy hat and some six guns.  They say he's grown up, though, so hopefully he has.  Everything's fine.  Hopefully he has.  Management now.  Well, we're waiting.  You know, it's another great James Conn movie.  Speaking of freebie and the bean, the gambler.  Did you ever see that one?  Oh, that's a great one.  Yeah.  Awesome movie.  Yeah.  He's just a sick, degenerate gambler in it.  It's really cool.  Paul Servino's also in it.  He keeps making more and more dangerous bets and losing. 
[01:50:30]  And then finally he just gets a black hooker and starts a fight with her pimp.  Yeah.  It turns out, obviously he's got nothing to do with gambling.  He can't gamble any more money, so he gambles with his life.  Oh, wow.  He slaps a dangerous pimp.  Yeah.  Huggy Bear.  Huggy Bear played Antonio Barnes.  Huggy Bear, of course he did.  Yeah, of course.  What else is he going to play?  The president in a movie?  Yeah.  I got to check that movie out.  All right.  We're waiting to see what we can do with that other story.  I might have to wait until we get over to XM, which is fine with us. 
[01:51:00]  I like that story.  We do like that one.  We could go with this.  The New Orleans story is really good, too.  All right.  Listen to this.  One of the big stories today.  He wanted to listen to jazz music on North Rampart last night.  Instead, musician John Gross sat outside of King Bolden's bar, shocked.  Yeah, that's beyond anything that I've directly experienced before.  Just a few doors down.  She is dismembered.  Police find a woman murdered in this apartment thanks to a tip from her killer, her body in pieces. 
[01:51:30]  Police say the man who did this jumped to his death right after from the rooftop bar of the Omni Royal Hotel last night.  But the scene at the Omni Royal Hotel was just the beginning of a long night for police.  When they checked inside of the suicide victim's pockets, they found a five-page suicide note,  leading them to an apartment complex on the 800 block of North Rampart.  When the detectives went in the apartment, they found a dead white female that had been dismembered. 
[01:52:00]  Sources close to the investigation tell eyewitness news they found her legs inside of the oven,  her head in a pot on the stove, and the rest of her body in a trash bag.  Police say her boyfriend even left her family's contact information for the police before he left for the Omni Royal.  It appears he cleaned it up a lot before he left.  Police say he planned the whole thing.  I would imagine that he was in some serious mental anguish and pain. 
[01:52:30]  Can you imagine?  I couldn't fathom to think what caused him to do it.  Good call.  But he had to be in some serious pain to do it.  Lucy Bustamante, Channel 4, I've missed news.  Did he at least put a mint on the pillow?  It'd be really funny if they say, what was your reason?  He's like, I loved her, but honest to God, I was just hungry.  It's starving.  It's in my mind not to do that, I forgot.  Were they married?  Every place was closed that I called for takeout.  I saw those legs.  They weren't married. 
[01:53:00]  They'd hooked up.  They were actually featured in a story during Katrina that they weren't going to evacuate,  so they stayed there.  And the news did a whole story on them.  They're out in front of this place cooking beans on some open fire.  Coincidence.  Five-page suicide note.  It's a little long.  Five pages.  You don't want to write a suicide note where people are going, da-da-da, what else?  All right, yada-yada.  You don't like life.  You don't want people to start skimming on your suicide note. 
[01:53:30]  There's no fun about that.  Desperation.  Couldn't get a job.  The Katrina.  I couldn't help myself.  Blah, blah, blah.  A tasty bitch.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, so they did a feature on them, and he dismembered her, and then the legs were in  a pan in the oven and turned on, so they were burnt.  I hate to interrupt you.  Yes.  But on the phone.  Oh.  Hold that thought.  On the phone.  Speaking of the lady that was... 
[01:54:00]  Burnt legs.  Right.  We have the legs.  No, it's Jerry Springer.  Oh, there you go.  Wow.  Jerry.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Jerry.  Jerry Springer.  There he is.  Jerry, you know that we know...  You're the reason I'm still on.  I told you, guys.  All of our listeners...  All of our listeners are just pounding the phone lines and voting for Jerry Springer.  That's right.  This is not good for America.  Look, we have video of you.  This is perfect timing. 
[01:54:30]  They're showing you on Good Morning America, falling to the floor going, what is going on?  But Jerry knows what's going on.  Right, Jerry?  Well, I suspected that that might happen, what happened last night.  But when we were finally under the spotlight, and they do the drum roll, and one of the two  couples are going home, then I thought, you know what?  I'm wrong, and they'll probably do something like this next week or the week after.  I really thought I was going home then.  Yeah, you did, huh?  Sorry, Jerry.  You are not going home. 
[01:55:00]  Until we decide.  Yeah.  Let me make a case to you, okay?  All right.  See, this is what happened three weeks ago.  He begged us, like, don't do this to me.  Go ahead, Jerry.  The floor is yours.  Yeah, well, it's enough.  Enough.  He's had it.  I love that that's the case.  No, it's, you know, I mean, it's fun, but it really isn't fair.  Don't fight anymore.  It's a free country.  That's great dancers.  It's not fair for the other dancers.  We know, Jerry.  They're really good.  We don't care.  The thing is that when unfair things happen to dancers, it doesn't matter. 
[01:55:30]  You know what our listeners are hearing right now, right?  Vote for Jerry.  Vote for Jerry.  Vote for Jerry.  And all, all, they love watching you dance.  Yeah, and next week I have to do, what, now I have to do, what, the mambo and the foxtrot?  Is it the foxtrot?  By the way, you look stunning in your matador outfit.  Yeah.  Well, you did, honestly, guys, when was the last time you did a mambo?  I can't say, the mambo.  Mambo.  Mambo.  Carlos.  Tuna fish. 
[01:56:00]  What am I, a cat or something?  My grandmother didn't do this.  So, Jerry, how are the knees holding up?  They actually do hurt, particularly the left knee.  I mean, they got it really taped up and it's absurd, you know?  You know, what do they, you know?  And Emily Smith, God love him.  He's an athlete.  I mean, at least they're as cool as you can be.  How embarrassed are you every week when the crowd starts booing because you're not getting voted off?  Yeah, that's got to hurt.  And it's not my idea. 
[01:56:30]  Now, the judges always give you very, very bad scores.  Yeah, but they're always very nice.  Yeah, they're very nice.  They're really nice and then they always give me the lowest score, which means they at least have integrity.  Right.  Yeah, but they really give you the lowest scores.  And they really do not want you on this show.  Yeah.  Can't you quit?  Can't you just say, I don't want to do this anymore or you just don't have it up?  Well, he has a dance party he has to think of.  Yeah, because as soon as I lose, they put her on a boat back to Australia. 
[01:57:00]  Wow.  Jerry, are they on to us yet?  A boat?  Are they on to us yet?  Are they who?  Are they on to us?  Are they on to us?  Yeah.  Has anyone said anything like, hey, is this voting rigged or something?  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  No, it's, they're real careful about that with the FCC and everything.  No, that actually is, no, it's accurate.  I mean, they don't mess with that.  But we don't doubt it's accurate.  So that means we have a chance to make you win this whole thing still, right? 
[01:57:30]  I mean, if people keep voting, I guess it is possible.  I mean, but it's absurd.  This is the guy that runs the Jerry Springer show saying this is absurd.  Oswald on Instant Feedback.  I voted for Jerry almost 500 times the other night.  This is great.  This is wonderful.  They shoot horses, don't they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just like that.  Yeah.  Well, there's just no excuse for this. 
[01:58:00]  But, I mean, I'm trying.  It's just, everyone thinks I threw it last, like, two nights ago.  Like, no, I wasn't trying to lose.  That was, you know, that's what it is.  Yeah.  And then they say, oh, you weren't trying.  That was my best effort.  Your best effort has people thinking you're trying to throw the fight.  Yeah.  What does that say?  You know, talk about self-esteem.  Now, your partner.  Yes.  Is very good.  She's phenomenal.  She really is.  She is.  And I guess people are assuming that's what's getting you through. 
[01:58:30]  Well, of course.  No, I think it's my back step that does it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's good.  Yeah.  She's getting me through.  She's great.  By the way, Jerry, no deals.  We're going to see how far we can take this.  We are pushing you into the winner's circle, my friend.  Yeah.  Oh, this is great.  I'm going to make you a partner in my new line of dance studios.  Hey, do you get to talk?  Like, if you get kicked off, either way, do you get to talk?  Yes.  Okay.  So, no matter what, do you get to say something?  I was working on my speech last night. 
[01:59:00]  And it's a good one.  And you're really going to like it.  Does it have the words Opie and Anthony show in it?  Yeah.  It certainly should.  Yeah.  You continue to dance for our pleasure, Jerry.  That's right.  Yes.  Dance.  We make you dance.  I am not worthy.  Opie and Anthony, I'm not worthy.  We're like Charlie Sheen, and you're like that Vietnamese guy with the big teeth, and  we're just shooting at your feet.  Dance.  Yeah.  It's like the guy in the old cowboy movies.  Yeah.  The pistol, yeah.  It's like, Pa, Pa, what was that movie? 
[01:59:30]  It's Spider.  Oh, my God.  Shane.  You've got to go to...  Shane, Dane.  You've got to go to ABC.com.  The message board is just filled with comments from the ONA Pest.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And they're voting like crazy.  They love you, Jerry.  They're going to be voting for you.  And I apologize for that, but there really is no other way this can go.  No.  That's right.  Okay.  This will be good for America.  Yes.  Yeah, of course it is.  And you think the culture's falling apart.  Now, where are you off to do your regular show? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, now I'm...  Right.  Now I'm in a few minutes flying back to Chicago.  Sorry.  Chicago to do the show.  What do you got lined up?  How many shows do you do in one day?  Well, now, while this is going on, I do three shows a day.  Three shows a day.  So you've got to deal with three shows worth of those mutants?  Another reason why he wants off the show, because it's killing him.  Yeah.  You have to fly to Chicago, do his show, and then he goes flying back to...  Where is it?  L.A., I guess?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You fly commercial or private?  Private.  I have my own plane.  Oh, look at you.  Look at me. 
[02:00:30]  Well, if you were a dancer, you'd have one, too.  Jeez.  You're a pilot or...  No, no, no.  You fly yourself up there, no.  I like to see his rudder kneecap go out and come spin in.  Yeah.  We've got another guy, Mel from Connecticut.  I auto-dialed 4,800 times.  4,800, folks.  Jerry, you're going to continue to dance.  Okay.  All right, Mr. Springer.  You guys can be there at the ceremony, okay?  I would love it.  Great.  Hey, thanks a lot.  Have a safe flight.  Thank you, Jerry. 
[02:01:00]  Have fun, man.  See?  Bye, sweetie.  Just in case you guys thought we were making this up.  That's awesome.  We're completely controlling Dancing with the Stars with Jerry Springer.  That's awesome.  It's getting tougher and tougher as the weeks go on.  I just love how miserable he is that this is working.  He didn't want it right from the start.  No, that was three weeks ago.  It wasn't like, hey, guys, make sure you vote for me.  He was going, I want off this show.  And that's the only reason we were saying, guys, vote for this guy.  Yeah.  We want to make his life miserable.  It's going to be tough, so O&A pass.  Let's see what we can get done, okay?  Vote for Jerry, abc.com. 
[02:01:30]  Yep.  More with Louis C.K. and Otto and George.  Otto, where are you going to be?  Comics?  C-O-M-A?  Comics tonight with Nina Hartley.  And it's like a brand new club.  It's supposed to be like a $10 million club.  It's on 14th Street.  It's in the Meatpack District.  It's actually run by the same people who run this other club in Denver.  It's supposed to be a very great place.  All right.  We'll talk more with Otto and George and Louis C.K.  playing the Trump marina.  That's right.  Saturday night.  Saturday night.  Okay.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum. 
[02:02:00]  I play the O.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email Steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas,  or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this s***.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:02:30]  We never stopped doing the show.  But we had to get the commercials in.  The O.P. and Anthony Show, the O&A virus spreading across America.  Louis C.K. in studio playing the Trump marina Saturday night.  And Otto and George, the great Otto and George,  with Nina Hartley actually at Comics Tonight.  On 14th Street in the Meatpacking District.  It's a very hot new comedy club here in New York City.  Yeah.  And how can they get tickets?  Do you know Otto?  Ah. 
[02:03:00]  212-524-2500.  Secret agent, man.  I have one thing I have to mention.  New Year's Eve, I'm doing the Borgata in Atlantic City.  Tickets go on sale Saturday morning at Ticketmaster if you want to go.  I can't wait.  And Roland had something to tell people.  Very briefly.  Oh, Roland.  I forget.  It was just something he mentioned to me that I couldn't quite grab.  Yeah.  What was it about my Hammerstein show?  Yesterday, a guy called Ed Norton wants to come see Jimmy at Hammerstein.  Oh, November 10th.  Yeah.  Wow.  No.  I won't accept this as fact. 
[02:03:30]  No, this is a lie.  No.  This is a lie.  These two are in cahoots together.  I can't stand this.  He's excited to see him.  He hasn't seen him live before.  Yeah.  Edward needed four tickets.  I wasn't sure that Roland said that.  No, no.  I wasn't trying to really say anything.  I just thought he wanted to.  You don't know how it annoys me that an actor like Edward Norton, who I think is a really  good actor.  Oh, Edward Norton.  Edward Norton.  The actor is a fan of this little nothing.  Oh, cut it out. 
[02:04:00]  He just wanted to come to see some comedy.  I just four tickets.  I just wasn't sure what you said.  I didn't mean to him.  You stink.  We were talking about party lines and scanners and stuff during the break.  Yeah.  Yeah, the 900 numbers.  I didn't know you used to be a moderator.  Louie used to be a moderator.  For a 900 number?  And a 900 number in Boston when I was living there.  Because it was the only job I could get that was from, like, I started at midnight and worked  until 7 in the morning.  And I had to listen to people's conversations. 
[02:04:30]  But it was always, like, 50 guys just in silence.  Why did you have to listen, by the way?  Because if they were rude, I was supposed to cut them off.  And I also was supposed to spark conversation.  In case there was a lonely action.  Like, hey, guys.  Yeah.  Well, like, you're one of the guys, though, right?  I'm one of the guys I'm supposed to be.  Well, they knew I was a moderator.  But anyway, there would always be these guys that would fight, start fights with each other.  And they'd make plans to meet and fight somewhere.  They'd go, like, I'm going to kick your ass.  I'm going to kick your ass.  Where are you, faggot? 
[02:05:00]  I'm in Quincy.  How do I get to your house?  All right, you know when you go, you know, Route 1A?  That's what we did that on the show.  That's where that was from.  Route 1A.  Go Route 1A to the 7-Eleven, make a right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I know where that.  All right, I'm going to kick your ass, faggot.  Every day that happened.  And I'd leave.  I was supposed to break those up, but I liked listening to them.  So sometimes I'd isolate two guys that hated each other on one line and let them fight.  It was awesome.  And then a girl would come in and...  And everybody would just start, oh, can I get your number? 
[02:05:30]  Can I get your number?  And then she'd leave.  She'd panic and leave, right?  Sometimes I would isolate the girl and masturbate on the phone with her.  It really did.  It was really foul.  Because you're getting paid.  Yes.  It was a real creep.  That's wonderful.  Did she know you were a mod or no?  Yeah.  That's how I, you know, they found that sexy.  So I used to get girls to talk to me.  And I'd be in this little office.  Why wouldn't you meet them?  Playing with myself.  What?  Why wouldn't you meet them?  They're all fat.  Who calls what?  Attractive girl.  Yeah, exactly.  Anything.  What are you buying the commercials that go on?  Hi. 
[02:06:00]  I saw a commercial.  No pretty girl ever dials the phone.  My name is Amber, and you could call me.  Pretty girls just sit there and people have sex with them when they want them to.  Yeah.  Yeah, the commercials for those are always the worst.  Some of the best times Ed and I had back in Boston was listening in on his scanner,  his illegal scanner at the time.  I had a scanner, and I'd listen to cell phone calls and cordless phone calls from the apartment  complex.  We would just get a ton of beer and just sit around on a Friday night just listening in  on these conversations. 
[02:06:30]  And then you'd hear like, you'd hear the ring, and it would lock in on the signal.  And you'd never know what you would get.  Oh, here it comes, here it comes.  And then sometimes it'd just be, hi, honey, I'm coming home from work or something.  All right, see you in a little bit.  Most of the calls are just regular crap you hear every day.  Remember the guy crying because his wife caught him cheating?  Oh, that was one of the best ones, too.  That's what guys always do, they cry.  The guy's crying.  I know, I know, I know.  She goes, what you did to our marriage after so long, she's crying. 
[02:07:00]  And the guy just went, I know, I know, I know.  Wait, he caught her cheating?  No, she caught him.  Oh, okay.  And they were trying to work it out with us listening in.  Oh, it was great.  We were laughing so hard.  You know, he's checking ball scores.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Oh, this guy was a mush, man.  But we were talking about one call I got.  We linked into it.  We were just drinking beers, hanging out, having fun.  And something someone said was funny.  And we did the old knee slapper. 
[02:07:30]  She was talking to some dude.  And we kind of slammed our foot on the floor like, holy jeez, that was funny.  And she goes, oh, those neighbors upstairs are constantly making noise.  They're up late at night.  And it was you.  And we were like, oh, my God, she's right downstairs.  So we tapped again.  She's like, oh, I'm making noise.  Upstairs always.  They never sleep.  Like, this is great.  Let's really start screwing with her.  So I had one of those vases with, like, pebbles in it and took some pebbles out  and then went out onto my balcony.  I was fourth floor. 
[02:08:00]  She was third.  And started throwing pebbles at her sliding glass door like I'd lean over the railing  and throw it real hard.  And she would be, wait, I'm hearing noises out on my patio.  It was like a horror movie.  It was a video game.  It was an interactive game.  It really was.  And then we sent Jay from Framingham down to knock on her front door and run.  He was the drunkest.  I remember he would panic.  He would knock and start falling.  I'm like, dude, just go downstairs.  It looks the same as this apartment door, only downstairs one flight.  Just knock on it and run back upstairs. 
[02:08:30]  But be quiet.  And you would hear the stares and the phone call of the guy panicking.  Everything was coming over.  So she got so scared that the guy that she was on the phone with, she goes, could you  please just come over and stay with me tonight?  Because I'm afraid, you know, stay on the phone.  We got this guy some action.  I'm afraid.  It's like, geez, we got the guy laid.  It was amazing.  That's awesome.  But it was interactive.  And we were just messing with her and it was getting worse and worse.  Why did you have a vase with a vase?  A vase.  It was like one of those vase. 
[02:09:00]  Who knows?  I've been divorced for frigging 12 years.  That happens eventually.  That's why I had it.  Hey, Jimmy, not to top your Hammersteins thing, but New Year's Eve, I'm at the ground  round in Parsippany and Doug McClure is coming to see me.  Doug McClure.  Brock Peters.  Edward Norton requested to see you.  When you're a fan of somebody, don't you try to get tickets? 
[02:09:30]  Shut up.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Leah on Long Island.  Leah.  I want big Hollywood friends.  Yeah.  Leah.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi.  Ahua.  Not a straight night out.  It's really Leah, not Leah, but that doesn't matter.  All right.  So I'm calling about my daughter.  She's 15 today.  Look, that snatch.  She's 15?  Yeah.  And, you know, she always, her older sister always steps in shit. 
[02:10:00]  She'll like everything good.  All right.  Let's get on with the Carson.  You're a potty mouth is what you are.  Enough.  We're trying to get some of this on the radio.  So your daughter's 15 today.  What do you want from us?  And your other daughter gets lucky or something like that?  Very lucky, yeah.  And what happened was a couple of weeks ago I had a garage sale and we were selling...  No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's better.  Okay.  So this guy buys a Nintendo.  And as he buys it, she goes, I wanted that.  I didn't want you to sell that. 
[02:10:30]  Now it's her birthday.  And everything I went to buy, nothing was right.  I had to return.  She doesn't even know, like, what her presents are.  And I realized that she wanted an Nintendo, but it's a Mario Brothers.  Oh, it's a Mario Brothers.  So why don't you go buy her a Nintendo?  That's the good part.  Sell them.  They don't sell them anymore.  Oh.  They're in line with the problem.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So what do you want from us?  Now I'm with you.  Okay, that if you could put out on the radio, if anybody on Long Island has one that they're  willing to sell me, I mean, not, like, to rip me off, but, you know... 
[02:11:00]  How about this?  I do have one.  I do have one.  Yeah.  What are you looking to spend?  But I don't want money for it.  Hey, listen, Mom.  Oh.  I don't want money for my Nintendo.  I actually have one that is basically just out of the box because right after I got it,  I got an upgraded, like, a PlayStation.  I just didn't use it.  So it's, for all intents and purposes, brand new.  Now, I know you're interested in that.  How much would you be willing to pay for it?  What do you want to sell it for?  I don't want money, if you understand what I'm saying.  Here's the point I'm making. 
[02:11:30]  If you're willing to, let's just say, enjoy a little throat yogurt, I will give you...  Okay.  I will give you this thing for your daughter's birthday.  Yeah, that's fair.  Oh, come on.  It's her birthday.  You got to do better than that.  That's why I'm not making her do it.  I'm saying...  I don't know how that would go over.  All right, well, then you don't want it.  It's basically out of the box I have no use for.  You don't love her.  You don't sound like you.  Yeah, way to go. 
[02:12:00]  I love her.  I love her.  I'm calling the show.  I love her.  Way to look out for your daughter.  Yeah, go ahead.  You sold for Nintendo to get a garage sale, and now you're not even willing to do that.  Exactly.  To make up for it.  Hey, lady.  I got a husband that's begging for that.  Oh, my God.  Okay, then let him get the Nintendo.  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  You should buy her a book.  Hey, stupid.  Can I ask you something, stupid?  Do you have a computer?  Do you own a computer?  Or did...  I did the eBay thing.  I couldn't find it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Now, hold on. 
[02:12:30]  Do you have a computer?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Just stick to the questions here.  Do you know you can download any game that that system could play onto your computer and  play it?  That you don't need that?  That's why it's not sold anymore?  Yeah, but it's not the same thing.  You're right.  Absolutely.  Yeah, it's not that awful television picture.  She likes it.  Just go to eBay. 
[02:13:00]  Why are you a father and I?  Is your daughter a retard?  Buy her a book or something.  Have it a book.  It's not...  Why is it being mean?  I listen to you every day.  We like you.  Then you know we're mean.  Just then answer the question.  Is she a waterhead?  I know you're mean.  What does she got?  A waterhead.  My favorite is...  What is it?  Dot, dot, dot, dash me.  That was very funny.  Right.  Oh, hysterical.  What was your drink of choice during pregnancy?  Dash, dash.  All right, listen.  The video game is going to make your daughter stupid.  So buy her a book or something.  Like mom.  It doesn't matter that she wants it. 
[02:13:30]  All right, listen.  We got Tom on Long Island.  Tom, can you help this girl out?  Yeah.  I still have...  She wants the original Nintendo, like the first one, not the Super Nintendo.  Yeah.  I still have it.  Like, never used.  All right, never used.  She wants to play Duck Hunt.  I say it like Duck Hunt.  Right.  Because if you say it too quickly, it gets dumped out of it.  Now there's something that's being thrown at your head. 
[02:14:00]  Hey, by the way, I was in a...  Duck.  I still got this thing.  If there's any way we could cut a deal here.  You ever been to Chinatown where they have duck vaginas?  They sell them by the barrel.  No way.  They sell them, like, by the barrel.  Barrels of duck vaginas, like, with a scoop stuck in it.  Get out of here.  Is it a delicacy?  Could we dominate a species more than that?  We're still in their vaginas in big barrels with a scoop. 
[02:14:30]  I didn't want to try it because I'm afraid I'll, like, what if I love duck vaginas?  Then you're going to have to just go and get them all the time.  Because nothing could taste like a duck vagina.  It must be, like, really specific.  No restaurant serving.  No.  Bring yourself, just cook this.  All right, listen, Tom, we got to go.  All right, man.  And Lee, I don't know what to tell you.  Lee, yeah.  Give me some coffee cup.  Lee?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'll get nothing and like it.  Yeah, you'll lose.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, your problems don't matter at all.  That's right.  Bye-bye, bad mommy.  Jesus. 
[02:15:00]  Not even close to mattering.  Not even.  We really got to get out of here.  We're real late today.  Louis C.K., Trump Marina, Saturday night.  He did a...  You were great today.

Hello, sir.  I think that was only heard on that.  How are you doing, gentlemen?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They probably did dump out.  Hi, boys.  Hey, guys.  A couple of fans.  Yeah, duck vaginas, did they talk about that?  I'm not sure.  Because it wasn't said in a sexual context.  No, it really wasn't.

How much of the chicken do you eat and then you're still hungry, where you have to go,

Well, I can't hear.  Here.  That's not...  I make 20 a day.  20 a day?  I make $40 a day, but this is about $15.  Where do you find a lot of your cans?  At the spots, you know, in front of the buildings.  In front of the buildings?  And outside the coffee shops.  Oh, look at that.  I almost got hit by that.  So that's what it is. 
[02:23:30]  And is this what you do full-time?  I'm unemployed.  Oh.  I'm looking for a job, you know, so it's very hard to...  So you do that and...  I work, you know, because I'm, like, semi-retired, you know, very close to retirement.  What's it you used to do?  Uh, financial analyst.  Wow.  You know, that's today.  You are a financial analyst?  Yes.  Today...  If you're doing this, what the fuck are your old clients doing?  How are your clients doing?  But today is very difficult because they have the computer network.  Right.  People can't get information from the computer. 
[02:24:00]  They don't need you anymore.  They don't need the financial analyst.  The financial analyst himself.  Right.  Because the information is in the computer.  But don't they need somebody on the other end of the computer?  No, they need the big guy.  So why don't you do that?  Now you tell your clients, like, Diet Pepsi cans are up.  Yeah.  Fanta.  Mountain Dew cans are doing moving well.  A radio?  What do you think?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's a little bit of radio.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Hey.  You got any fresca? 
[02:24:30]  That's what I call talent.  Very good.  Very good.  That's what I call talent, he says.  No, really?  I used to write a little bit of poetry in college, you know?  Oh, do you remember any?  Huh?  Do you remember any?  Any of your poetry?  Any poetry?  Maybe you can recite some.  I have that talent.  I don't have any.  Can you recite a little for us?  I don't remember any.  It's been a long time.  You don't remember poetry?  No.  It's been a long time.  It's been a long time.  Oh, who's behind me?  How are you?  Oh, wow.  You look familiar. 
[02:25:00]  You know, if you crush the cans, you could put more in the bag.  Oh, wow.  That's a pretty smart thing, Kenny.  Financial advice for the can picker.  Is that?  Yeah.  I used to be a wolf man.  Well, no one can hear you, sir.  Yeah, there you go.  If you recycle aluminum, you crush the cans, put them in, you know, take them to the recycling  center, but I sell it five cents each, you know, which is deposit, you know, a thousand 
[02:25:30]  cans is $50, you know?  Oh, you know your math.  You know your math.  Okay.  I want to hear some.  Okay.  He's had enough.  I got to keep.  Yeah, I want to hear some poetry.  Yes.  We want to hear some poetry, some homeless poetry.  I don't remember any.  It's been a long time, my friend.  How about roses are red, violets are blue.  My balls smell like Katrina just blew over them.  Can I see how heavy the cans are?  Yeah.  Come on.  Okay.  Yeah, because he lugs them around.  You can't judge a man until you hold it.  This isn't going to be good. 
[02:26:00]  Over here now holding the cans.  Wow.  These are really.  How much is this?  $240 and $60.  Just $300.  Just $300?  $300 cans.  Just put them in the middle.  Just leave them in the middle of 57th.  Wow.  Hope he's walking around now with the guy's cans.  That's $15.  Damn it.  The NYPD just drove by.  I can't do it.  Look at him.  He's looking at you.  He's looking at you.  Well, there goes that bit.  I'm not that brave.  Enjoy your cans, sir. 
[02:26:30]  What does he make?  $40 a day?  He's talking to you.  I don't know.  $40 a day.  XM Radio, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  I remember.  You subscribe to that?  Okay.  It's only 8,000 cans a month.  Here, we got some Burger King coupons for you.  All right.  God bless.  You have no idea how lucky you are today, sir.  Hey, man.  Let me double your daily take there.  Double your income.  Hey, that's nice.  Big K.  Throwing a few 20s.  Hey, the guy's nice and sheep.  I make a lot more than him.  I remember poetry next time.  Huh?  I remember the poetry next time.  Yeah, remember poetry next time. 
[02:27:00]  We're here every morning, so you come by with poetry.  Don't expect a handout every morning, but if you do some poetry, it can be worth a few  bucks, I'm thinking.  Okay.  Once in a while.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go, my friend.  What's your name?  Yeah, what's your name?  Bottle guy.  What's your...  Gonzalez, Frank.  All right.  Frank Gonzalez.  Okay.  Very good.  Frank.  There goes Frank.  He's been arrested so many times, he knows to say his last name first.  Yeah.  Frank.  Can I tell you what I was going to do?  We'll just call him Frankie Cans.  I was going to dump all the cans in the middle of 57th Street. 
[02:27:30]  I was just about to start doing it.  Oh, that would have been...  And an NYPD car, like, makes the left on a 57th.  Yeah, and he was looking...  And he was looking right at me because I was looking a little suspicious.  My life is better than that guy.  Yeah?  You think?  A lot better.  It is.  It does put things in perspective.  I don't have to carry stuff like that around.  You don't have to carry around a ton of cans.  Yeah.  I'm glad I'm not him in every way.  How is this guy...  Like, down to his smelly ear.  Who's this guy walking with us?  It's the shine.  They call it the shine. 
[02:28:00]  He's a comedian.  I've known him for many, many years.  Have you?  Just tell Mr. Miller his car is here.  Mr. Miller?  Mr. Miller?  Mr. Miller?  Go ahead.  Mr. Miller?  Mr. Miller?  Get in the car, Mr. Miller.  Trying to throw Flea into Mr. Miller's car.  All right, why don't we keep rolling?  Mr. Miller. 
[02:28:30]  You suck, Flea.  Flea, you ruined the bit.  Yeah, Flea.  You could have just hopped in.  Yeah.  What's up, Big A?  All the regulars out here today.  Is this your car?  Is that Big A's car?  Is that your car?  Um, actually, just today.  I usually drive across Victoria just today.  I know it's a piece of shit, but...  Whose car is it?  Um, it's company's car.  This is a company car?  Drunk.  This is a company car? 
[02:29:00]  What, did this thing back into you?  Wow, no, those are kick marks on the inside.  Yeah, I don't have it all the time.  This is awful.  We'll have the picture up on opianthony.com.  Jesus.  Andrew, this is horrid.  You drive people around as a cab driver in this thing?  Yes, actually, I dropped off in the area.  That's why I popped over here today.  Wow.  All right.  They're going to think this thing is abandoned or something.  That is the worst. 
[02:29:30]  Who gets in this and actually wouldn't just hop in a cab?  Like, why would you call this and get this fucking car?  If this car pulled up to get me one day, I would...  You've got sweet rims.  I'd punch you.  Look at those rims.  Nice.  You're going to let the air out.  Jesus.  Oh, shit.  I hope you let the air out of the tire.  Wow.  The car has been dying to do that since Big A sat in it. 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  That is awful.  And then you come in this car to pick me up?  We just gave the money to the wrong guy, I think.  We really need to give Big A the money.  You coming upstairs today, Big A?  I can't.  My head's getting back up to the Bronx.  What do you got to...  Oh, the Bronx.  Okay.  Yeah.  So usually, what, do you pull up in front of banks?  They jump in and you speed off?  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  Why not?  Great.  How many would you say black people to white people ratio per day for you? 
[02:30:30]  More white people.  I pick up in the rims that's more white people.  Really?  Yeah.  More white people?  Yeah.  I would think up there in the Bronx.  Yep.  Bronx.  More white people.  Good.  See me.  Stereotype.  What do I know?  Well, there you go.  All right.  That's...  What's this on the mirror?  I don't know.  Bulletproof stuff, I think.  Jesus.  Bye, Andrew.  How are you?  Good.  All right.  There's some kind of lock thing on the grill. 
[02:31:00]  What a mess.  Sir?  Cars like him.  A disaster.  I think that's about it today.  Yeah.  Unless you want to have a tomato fight.  Throw one of those cherry tomatoes.  Who's...  Is it your car?  No.  Who's truck?  Oh.  Who's going to mess with your tomatoes?  Oh.  What's going on here?  Hey, hold on.  Hold on.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Up.  Your skirt blew up.  I missed.  I missed. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  What do you think, sir?  Very nice.  Very nice, dude.  Yeah.  Your skirt blew up, man.  Oh.  Everybody saw it.  Your skirt blew up.  I couldn't help it.  All right.  Let's go upstairs.  Yeah.  Let's take it up for part two.  Part two.  Part two.  Part two.  Of the show.  Thank you. 
[02:32:00]  Mm-hmm.  O.P. and Anthony.  XM 202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined. 
[02:32:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're loose.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Cornwalls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I can have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm gay.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:33:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:33:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:34:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:34:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:35:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:35:30]  You people only knew what goes on here while this music is playing for an hour.  Must be important stuff, right?  No, it's not.  Do we have to fix that?  Problem?  Problem?  I'm not really sure. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, it's not the incorrect.  Yeah, look, look, look.  I can't get anything on the air.  I can't get anything on the air.  The machine's not working, man.  Fix it immediately.  Problem?  Problem?  No, it says Ron and Fez, so it might be hooked up for them.  Ron and Fez.  That doesn't matter?  It shouldn't.  Hmm.  Yeah.  My machine doesn't work today.  You know the hot chick that Kenny, when she's walking across the street, Kenny goes, your  skirt blew open?  Yeah.  She's on her elevator, and she was really nice, and she goes, someday your tooth is  going to hurt.  She's a dentist in the building with those big, beautiful breasts, and believe me, I 
[02:36:30]  made an appointment on the elevator.  See, I want to get a teeth whiting, because I want to do it anyway.  She's an actual dentist?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm such a chauvinist asshole.  She's like, I'm a dentist.  I'm like, really?  And everybody on the elevator laughs.  She's like, yeah, we come in all sizes and shapes.  All kinds of dentists.  Oh, she was sexy, man.  I would love her to work on my teeth.  And she's got to have a crazy business.  Yeah.  She certainly will.  I'll go and...  Getting cleanings twice a week?  That's awesome.  Right, and so does the laundromat right downstairs, because I cum in my pants. 
[02:37:00]  DJ Anna Lightbulb from posthores.net.  Oh, what happened to foaming pussy?  I thought that had potential.  Oh, I was undermined.  Huh?  I closed down the Opie and Anthony room.  Yeah.  As a joke, because baby girl was just sitting there with her shirt off, and everybody was  like drooling.  So as a joke, I shut the room down until we got over here. 
[02:37:30]  They all just went to another room.  Of course they did.  So now our room is empty, and the fan room is full.  Let's see.  It backfired.  Boring.  It backfired.  I was just...  Now that thing works.  But now I need my instant feedback back.  Who's this new guy?  Who's the new guy that's messing me up here today?  All right.  Thank you.  One new guy.  Yeah, and foaming pussy.  Yeah, we thought that had potential.  We got to get that going again.  We got to go back to the lab with that and make that happen.  Back to the lab.  So far, we've had one girl do foaming pussy. 
[02:38:00]  See how different things are over here?  Foaming pussy, yeah.  Foaming pussy's great.  I'm looking at the dumps from the other show.  Yeah.  It says that I said, may I blow your dad?  I don't remember saying that.  Did I say, may I blow your dad?  I don't remember what the fuck...  It was a pointy and slip.  What the context was.  Well, there's a...  Apple.  Well, there's a...  Was that just something I said to you?  Just like, you got a light for a cigarette?  Can I blow your dad?  No, what's weird is they also read your mind over there.  And they added to the dump page, so... 
[02:38:30]  She's a cunt.  I remember that.  It's a new technology they're trying out over there.  Hey, let's do the dump report with Club Soda Caddy.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  We start off 6.09 a.m.  A caller, you guys make me piss my pants every morning.  Oh, I can't say piss your pants.  That sucks.  That's not...  We needed a compliment, too.  And then he backed it up again, 6.09, and I piss my pants. 
[02:39:00]  That seems so light.  Yeah.  I mean, if he said, you make me shit in my mother's vagina every morning...  Right.  Then I could understand.  Yeah.  I laugh so hard, I shit in my mother's cunt.  That's funny.  That's funny material.  Yeah, you know you laugh at the heart.  Come over here.  You know you're laughing hard.  Yeah.  7.51 a.m., Louis C.K. makes his debut.  Piece of shit like you.  I don't remember that either.  Talking about Jimmy Norton.  That's right. 
[02:39:30]  That's right.  Backs it up.  7.53 a.m., Louis C.K.  She's got shitty timing.  And do we have no Saget dumps?  I thought he got dumped a couple of times, no?  Oh, my God.  He was good.  Are you kidding?  He did all right today.  He didn't get...  I'm sure he should have been dumped for something.  He's networked.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's networked Bob now.  He's networked Bob.  You've seen diarrhea and stuff like that?  He's networked Bob, though.  He knows how to do it.  Yeah.  He did tap dance around the regulations.  Yeah, you know.  Bob's a good boy.  7.56 a.m.  A caller chimed in, asshole, asshole, and fucking. 
[02:40:00]  Not cool.  7.58, Louis C.K. again, piss all over the place.  As if pissing in pants isn't bad enough.  Now you're just pissing all over the place.  All over the place.  All willy-nilly.  I don't remember piss all over the place.  And here, 7.58, apparently Louis' favorite line, may I blow your dad.  No memory of it.  No memory of it.  This very morning, and I don't know why I said it.  You just said it, and you don't remember.  I don't know.  I just told you. 
[02:40:30]  May I blow your dad.  I don't know.  8.23.  May I?  I know.  It was proper.  It wasn't dumped for grammar.  That's normally something you say to a girl when you're picking up on a first date.  No one's going to punch you if you put it in those terms.  May I blow your dad?  Yeah.  Well, no.  You may not.  I'll be defensive.  Put a hold of this cock in my mouth.  What's wrong with you?  Hold it in there.  8.23, we can't leave Otto and George out.  No.  Oh, my aching cunt.  That was right on the line, though. 
[02:41:00]  They must have hesitated.  Just to be safe.  Just to be safe.  Otto's only been on our show a hundred times.  He's still learning.  He's going to be there soon.  That's always the gray area he's going to know.  It's not Otto.  It's George that's got the problem.  That's right.  Otto's fine.  Yeah.  And then Louis C.K., 8.26.  As Paul McCartney, I said this.  She's a cunt.  That was as Paul McCartney.  I believe it was more of a cunt.  A cunt.  She's a cunt.  A cunt.  8.52 a.m., Louis C.K., isolate the girl and masturbate on the phone with her. 
[02:41:30]  Sure.  Mm-hmm.  8.56, Otto and George again.  Lick that snatch.  Nice.  Wow, it sounded just like him.  Almost.  You didn't read the entire description.  Do you ever do phone sex, Jimmy?  Are you into that?  I used to be until the computer.  Yeah, many times.  Yeah.  Many times.  I find that sometimes they stray into an area that you're not into.  Oh, no.  And you have to politely ask.  Because they assume you're on with her.  She's like, yeah, I'm going to lick your cock.  And I'm like, yeah. 
[02:42:00]  And then she goes, I'm going to stick my finger in your ass.  And I go, oh, no, no, not really.  But she thinks.  She's like, yeah, no, you little fag.  I'm going to stick.  And then I have to go, okay, I'm the paying customer, and I don't want you to do that.  No, I mean it.  No, I mean, no, I'm not.  And she's like, oh, I'm sorry.  And then we go back to it.  The last dump of the day from that stupid woman caller who wanted a Nintendo.  Yeah.  Steps in shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  I got, you know, remember Drake Sather? 
[02:42:30]  I know the name.  The comedian shot himself in the head.  And he was a friend of mine.  I was having phone sex in a hotel on my cell phone.  And then I got a call on the other line with my manager telling me that he shot himself.  Who was telling him?  And I'm fully hard and close to coming.  And my manager says, did Drake just shot himself?  And I'm like, oh.  Like, I can't properly grieve until I get rid of this boner.  Yeah.  So I had to go like, I'll call you right back.  And I had to finish my fucking phone sex.  Because otherwise I'm like talking about poor dead Drake with a hard on. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, with a hard on.  So I got to get rid of it.  And I'm not going to.  Poor balls.  Yeah.  I don't want to jerk off to him.  Wow, that's rough.  Because I did right here in that.  A couple years ago?  Like a year ago now.  Did it flash in your mind as you were finishing off?  Of course.  It was not flash.  It was prominently.  Prominent.  Oh, Scott.  You can hear it reverberating.  How the fuck do you finish?  Well, you had to.  I ain't got something in common.  You both got shot.  That's right.  Wow.  All right, we got to take a break. 
[02:43:30]  They got to fix the equipment.  What's the matter?  I just got to communicate from the fan.  I don't know.  They're going to do some adjustments.  And our guest mics didn't work.  So apologies to Otto and to Louie.  They had to share a mic.  It just did not work.  And I have to apologize to all the pal talkers.  Why?  Because I shut the room down before we left.  And I have to apologize for that or else they won't let Baby Girl back into our room.  All right.  Please come back.  We apologize for him. 
[02:44:00]  It's so easy to get an apology out of us.  He's trying to put your foot down and it landed in shit.  When we get back to story of the day that we couldn't even attempt to touch over at the other place.  So we'll do it right after the break.  Next time on a very special Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray's brother needs a helping hand.  Ray, I got a problem, man.  You got to help me.  No.  I picked up a tranny last night at Hunts Point and there was an accident.  No.  We were trying this erotic asphyxiation thing and he, she was supposed to pitch me before it ran out of air.  What are you doing? 
[02:44:30]  But Ray's father isn't buying it.  What a lot of bull.  Come on.  All right.  You got me.  I picked him up on 10th Avenue.  The family hijinks don't stop there.  Ray, you got to help me get rid of the body.  I don't want to do it.  No, come on.  It'll be fun.  We'll chop it up and bury it out in Jersey.  I live on Long Island.  All on the next Everybody Loves Raymond, tonight at 8.  All right, we're back. 
[02:45:00]  Louis C.K. in studio.  Otto and George in studio.  Lots to do today.  This is the story we couldn't do over at Free FM.  Yeah, a little bit of a problem.  Which is fine.  Doing it over there.  So we come over here.  We're over here now.  That's what we do now.  Yeah.  This is probably the story of the day.  Although I got another story in front of me here.  Naked drunk driver kills man on Staten Island. 
[02:45:30]  Naked drunk driver.  Woman.  A woman was naked?  Yeah.  You want to start with this?  Yeah, let's start with that and segue into the love story of the bowling alley.  Right.  Because this is pretty interesting, too.  She was naked, but she was smart enough to be wearing her seat belt.  All right.  Well, that's all she was wearing.  She could have hurt herself.  On Staten Island now, the man is killed while trying to cross the street overnight.  And police say that the woman who hit him was driving naked and drunk. 
[02:46:00]  Eyewitnesses reported Lisa Calagresi.  She's live now in West Brighton with details for us.  All right.  Hottest drunk driving story ever.  She's giving naked drunk chicks a bad name.  It's not fair.  Yeah.  Really.  Not all of them are naked and drunk.  And killing people.  Yeah.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with being a naked drunk woman.  What if she was driving fine and this idiot just ran in front of her car?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, she might have been good at driving drunk and naked.  She had a flea for what reason?  That's what you got to think. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  She was leaving.  Or she just all drunk.  I'm fucking leaving.  One of those.  Like I got in a fight with her fucking boyfriend or husband.  And they're laying in bed.  They're naked.  Like it's some fucking fight starts over crumb up her ass or something.  And then she just, yeah, go, fuck it.  I'm fucking leaving.  And just walks out the door of the car.  Well, wouldn't they at least take your clothes in a pile maybe?  No.  That drunk.  That drunk.  Or somebody fucked her that well that she ran out of the room screaming into a car and 
[02:47:00]  ran a dude over.  She had to tell people how great someone fucked her.  I got to go to a mall and tell everyone how great he fucked me.  Oh.  She hits the gas and the jizz just rolls back with those french fries collect behind the seat.  Yuck.  Write what the details for us, Lisa.  Good morning, Laurie.  And the man was actually crossing the street to meet his brothers at a bar when he was hit  and killed by a speeding car.  Now, police say a naked drunk woman was behind the wheel.  That's the car she was driving.  It wound up being flipped over. 
[02:47:30]  She also hit that car, a red car with a man and a woman inside.  Fortunately, they were treated and released with minor injuries.  Fortunately, they were closed.  Twenty-four-year-old Talia Taylor is now being charged with DWI and vehicular manslaughter.  The victim has been identified as 41-year-old Big Larry Simon.  Big Larry.  So long, Big Larry.  Big dead Larry Simon.  Oh, damn.  Poor Big Larry.  What a way to go.  What a way to go, right?  Because you know at the funeral it's going to be all somber and shit, but everyone's going 
[02:48:00]  to go, dude, you got hit by a drunk naked bitch.  What are the fucking odds?  What are the odds?  Weird.  It takes away from your life, though, because they're not going to be talking about you at  the funeral.  No.  No.  It ruins your funeral.  Right.  It's not, you know, the fucking eulogy.  Big Larry was a man you could always go to.  Holy shit.  Fucking naked drunk brother.  Whenever you had a problem, Big Larry was there.  Helping out and fucking naked brother ran him over.  She was drunk. 
[02:48:30]  It's just a horrible night.  I mean, I go to the social club and I just see a guy laying kilt in the street.  And then I go to the bar and I'm there with his brothers.  It changes the whole story.  William Wallace dead in Staten Island.  Oh, fuck.  He was kilt in the street.  Was he?  Then I go in the bar and I'm there with his brothers and they didn't even know that it  was their brother laying in the street.  Taylor is being treated here at St. Vincent Hospital for only minor injuries. 
[02:49:00]  She may not have been wearing any clothes, but she was wearing a seatbelt.  Police say she was incoherent when she was brought to the hospital.  Yeah, well.  His brothers were waiting for him in the bar.  Where the fuck is he?  Fucking faggot.  Where the fuck did he go?  Oh, he's dead.  I don't want to tell him this story about some drunk naked chick they just arrested.  What the fuck is he? 
[02:49:30]  Jesus.  The twists and turns.  Fucking life takes, man.  No kidding.  Do we want to go here today?  Oh, no.  Lady Di?  We'll make it fast.  Lady Di.  Hey, how you doing?  How are you?  Hey, drunk.  Okay.  How's everything?  Lady Di.  Marion was in the other day.  Let's do a quick recap.  Lady Di used to be on our show.  She was part of the retarded Laverne and Shirley, we called them.  Childhood friends.  Lady Di.  And Marion, shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  So, Marion is married and doing fine.  Has been for years. 
[02:50:00]  Lady Di.  Lost her job.  Became a drunk.  Became homeless.  Lost her young teenage son where he now has to stay with her father because she's an incompetent mother.  Then ended up homeless.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You did.  Okay, go ahead.  Anyway, go ahead.  Ended up sleeping and giving blowjobs at the train station.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Some train station in Jersey.  No.  While you were homeless.  Two other homeless guys. 
[02:50:30]  Welcome to the show.  I didn't say.  Wait a minute.  So she's homeless blowing other, blowing homeless.  Yeah.  We're not just like a lot.  Blowjobs are supposed to get you up the ladder.  You don't blow other homeless people.  She's blowing her way down.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Well, blow me down.  That's what I meant.  I always wonder what Popeye meant by that.  Don't wrong about that.  Oh, my goodness.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Yeah.  Right.  Look at the way from we're getting around like that.  Homeless splooch.  You know?  Disgusting.  Come on.  So what's the update? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, what's...  Now, Marion came in and said, you're not homeless anymore.  Right.  I'm not homeless anymore.  Where do you live?  Do you still blow homeless guys?  I still live in the wizard there.  She's an old time now.  She gets nostalgic.  Can I suck your cock?  For old times' sake.  Sorry, Sal.  Can't do it.  I miss the smell of rotted flesh and metallic tinge.  I'm imagining it for us.  Hi, George.  Oh, stop saying hi to people.  All right.  Just get on with it.  Listen. 
[02:51:30]  We want to know.  What happened?  You're on the clock.  You don't have much time today.  Okay.  I don't have much time today.  I just called you up just about two minutes ago.  Hey, idiot.  Listen to us.  Now you have less time.  What happened?  What happened?  You live somewhere now.  Where do you live?  Is it a homeless shelter or do you have a house that you're paying rent for?  It's not a homeless shelter.  And yes, I do have to pay the rent over here.  Is it a halfway house?  No, it's not.  Are you drinking?  Are you still drinking?  No.  Yeah, that's a yes. 
[02:52:00]  That's a yes.  That's a yes.  That's a yes.  On occasion.  Okay, okay.  On occasion.  All right, good.  How's your son?  Yeah, and now that you have a home.  My son is really good.  I just talked to him last night.  Well, no.  Now that you're home, your son probably lives with you now, right?  No, he's coming.  He's coming over to my dad's house.  Why is that?  That's a better environment for him.  A better environment as per who?  As per my dad has a house and I do not.  As per maybe social services.  No, no, no. 
[02:52:30]  You're a failure as a mother.  You're a failure as a wife.  I am not.  Anthony, stop.  Why don't you let everybody know how your husband.  She's a possessed as a homeless blower, though.  As one of the best.  Okay, listen.  Why don't you let everybody know what your husband did so we wouldn't have to live with you anymore  or go through divorce proceedings or anything.  Let everyone know what your husband did.  All right.  And go.  Let's hear this again.  What did my husband do?  And go.  How did your husband get out of being married to you?  And go. 
[02:53:00]  My husband got out of being married to me because I divorced him.  No, no, no.  But just the memory of you that wouldn't leave.  Just being married to you drove him to do what?  To do blank.  What finally happened?  No, no, no.  To do blank.  What finally happened?  Floor is yours.  First of all, first of all.  Your husband kissed a blank.  Ah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Richard Dawson.  Ah, he said kill himself.  I'm going to say a choo choo train.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, your husband decided. 
[02:53:30]  I saw your commercial on television, and you looked really, really nice.  No one cares.  Yeah, so what happened to you?  That's nice of you.  What happened to your husband?  It doesn't matter.  Just tell Louie, because he doesn't know what's going on.  We're trying to paint you as a complete person, and you're running around in circles.  Tell Louie, because he cares.  He cares.  Please tell me.  Okay.  All right.  Do I have to get into this again?  Yes.  Freely, because he doesn't know.  Quickly.  Okay.  Just listen to the show on a daily basis, you know, from what's next.  Get to the point. 
[02:54:00]  Get to the point.  What happened to your husband?  Louie C.K. wants to know.  What happened?  No, I wasn't married to this guy.  Okay, we don't care.  Just say what happened.  He's got his finger on the button.  You're going to be gone in seconds.  Come on now.  What happened?  This is what happened.  He committed suicide.  There you go.  How?  How?  How?  How?  How?  How?  What are you going to present?  How?  How?  Lewis C.K. needs to know.  Don't start me on this.  Just get it.  Just tell us how.  How?  How?  How?  Yeah.  How?  How?  How did he do it?  No, not the word how. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Jesus.  How?  How?  How did he do it?  Yeah, this is the first time Lewis has been on our show.  He needs to know.  I'm not an Indian, you know.  No, no, no.  Anyway.  Anyway, no, no.  What happened was...  Buffalo.  Yes.  Thank you.  How did he do it?  Okay, no.  This is...  No, no, no.  He...  Just say it.  This was years ago.  This was back in...  Do you want to punch her in the face?  This might be freeing.  Do you just want to punch her?  Just tell me what...  How did he do it?  What was the method?  Do you want me to get to the point?  Yes. 
[02:55:00]  What was the method?  He just...  He just...  Just decided to end his life and put himself in front of a train.  There's nothing funny about that.  Of course not.  Keep on bringing that up.  Was that a Will and Grace laugh?  Is that really necessary to keep on bringing that up?  Maybe.  You know what?  If you're going to come on the radio on a show like this, I think you must expect it.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Lady Di, listen to me.  Listen to me. 
[02:55:30]  If it helps you out any, you can just imagine that instead of killing himself, he actually  was trying to get back with you and he thought he was running to hug you.  You fat fucking train.  Wait a minute.  We would not...  Shut up.  You're probably saying it too harshly.  He jumped in front of a train.  He put himself.  She said he put himself in front of a train.  He put himself, yes.  In front of a train.  Like in theory, yes.  He was trying to empathize with the train.  He put himself in the place of the train.  He put himself in the place of the train.  So cruel.  No, no, no.  Diane, what you should have said is this.  Instead of... 
[02:56:00]  Why do you keep on asking me that?  Here's how you say it to make it gentle.  Because it's funny every time.  It's like a joke that just never gets told.  Exactly.  No, come on.  Diane, here's how you say it.  From now on...  Diane, here's how you say it.  Don't say he jumped in front of a train.  That's too cruel.  When they say what happened to your ex-husband, say he decided to smooch a choo-choo.  Yeah.  That sounds nice.  See?  He's not my ex-husband, first of all.  What is he?  Well, he's dead.  I was never married to him.  No.  Oh.  He ate a caboose.  But the thing is, why do you have to keep on bringing that up?  Because it's really interesting. 
[02:56:30]  I don't know why.  You broke up with him?  You rode him out on a rail, did you?  That was a long time ago.  Have your tickets ready.  Otto, please.  Did he leave a note?  No, no, no.  Yeah, any note?  Oh, good question.  Yes, my pancreas will be stuck under the dining car of the number 207.  From Rochester to Hartford.  Please leave my three undamaged toes to science.  Shut up, we're laughing at you.  And you've got to bring that up. 
[02:57:00]  Come on.  What did he write in the note?  Like, answer goodbye, bitch.  No.  To collect my legs, you must change a Jamaica.  Change a Jamaica.  What?  No.  Let me tell you something.  He's not going to be happy with you guys.  What?  He's not going to be happy with you guys if she's listening to the show.  Because I don't have the accent yet.  Oh.  You're the best.  He's not going to be.  Come on.  That's her godson.  Did he leave a note?  Did your, uh, a guy that wasn't your husband.  I don't know because I wasn't with him. 
[02:57:30]  Well, someone might have told you.  Because it was obviously your fault that it happened.  So did he say that in the note?  I have no idea.  I'd like to tell my loved ones.  No.  Should have given himself more time.  I looked at his watch or train schedule.  I'm telling you the truth.  And guys, you've got to stop bringing that up.  Come on.  All right.  You're right.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  All right.  Let's get back Amtrak.  You're right.  Yeah.  No.  No.  I don't know.  I actually said this is what a hack I am.  Hold on.  Shut up, Fatso.  I said, let's get back Amtrak. 
[02:58:00]  Like a funny wordplay went on track.  It was perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't enter that because I'm not that fat.  Let's not get into this.  He just wanted to test the Doppler effect with his lungs outside of his body.  Everybody's doing okay over here.  Yeah, everyone's doing the train.  Yeah, you've got to play that again.  Was this your wedding song?  No, it was not.  I was never met.  She says, no, it was not.  Actually, no.  I think it was a Titanic theme.  It wasn't a drain whistle. 
[02:58:30]  You sure it wasn't clang, clang, clang went to trolley?  Guys, guys, we were not married to each other.  Right.  I married later on to someone else.  Yeah, but the kid, you know.  Did he ever read his child the book, The Little Engine That Could Kill Me?  No.  If I stood in front of it like an adult.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You know, he's 16 years old now, you know.  Cool.  What? 
[02:59:00]  My son, he's 16 years old right now.  Yeah, and now he can actually know that his mother's a waste.  And he's 6'4", and I see him, you know, as I go over there and everything like that.  6'4", he's going to come and beat us up now.  Fucking son's going to come and kick us out of us.  I'm not saying that.  This was fun eight years ago when he was a kid.  I know, when he was a poor little kid.  You know, you can't change the past.  How old was your ex-husband when he died from metal hitting his body? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, how old was he?  Oh, God.  On purpose.  I'm 44.  Why do you keep on asking me these questions?  How old was he?  You only want to know it.  It is a good question.  This was back in 2001, so you figure it out.  How old was he?  He would have been 43.  He was 2000.  Oh.  It was 2001.  What was the date?  He was about 39 years old.  What was the date that he died on purpose?  Well, why do you have to keep on bringing that up?  I agree.  What was the date?  I agree. 
[03:00:00]  What was the date?  October.  Oh, God.  I think it was maybe October 26th.  I was trying to see if it was pre.  So it was after September 11th.  Yeah.  We're all still reeling from September 11th.  Maybe that was it.  Something like that.  You see, that was right before Halloween, and he wanted to go to his 30 different things,  and he couldn't decide.  Jim, you know, you guys, come on.  I'm only telling you I'm doing better, and you keep on bringing that up.  What's wrong with you guys?  Who's the dope that does that to himself, like, within six months of September 11th? 
[03:00:30]  You know you're getting no press.  No.  Exactly.  I wanted to call you up to let you know I'm doing good, and you've got to go bring that  up again.  No, tell us what's going on with you.  Are you okay?  Tell us what's going on with you.  What was that?  Tell us what's going on with you.  We'd like to know how you're doing.  So things are looking up like your husband saw you see a light at the end of the tunnel.  Oh, God.  I kind of expected that from that.  Oh, did you? 
[03:01:00]  Everything is going good right now.  I'm not working today because there's no work for me today.  I figured I'd give you a call.  I was going to call you up on a...  What are you doing now?  Who cares?  What are you doing now for work?  Doing hand jobs to pigeons.  No, I still do warehouse work.  No work today because the hobos are collecting cans.  Warehouse.  That's funny.  She said the same thing when she was homeless.  Warehouse.  Warehouse.  I am not homeless.  Don't laugh.  Oh, my God. 
[03:01:30]  I should have came up to the studio with Marion that one day.  Oh, yeah.  What would that have done?  I should have came up there.  What would that have done?  No, no, no.  But, no, no, she went over to the Columbus State Parade and it was our day off and everything  like that.  So, I just, you know, I just stayed home and that was it.  And that was it.  You just babbles.  I babble and I babble.  You babble.  So, that's it.  I don't know what else to say.  I mean, I should have came up there and everything, but I got up a little too late. 
[03:02:00]  She ought to pay that phone bill.  Yeah.  Wow.  Why is it so funny?  I guess, for me, it's because it's not me.  Oh, yeah.  I don't care.  That's good.  That's always the rule number one.  It's not me and I didn't know him.  Yeah.  I just don't.  What befalls others doesn't actually bother me at all.  Yeah.  Because it's not me.  God damn, you fit in well here. 
[03:02:30]  It's so true.  The further away they are, the less I care.  I was checking into an airport security once and there's a guy trying to push past people  because he's late.  He's like, I'm going to miss my flight.  And I'm like, no, you can't go in front of me.  Yeah.  Don't care.  And he's like, what time is your flight?  And I'm like, in like three hours.  I'm very early.  But we don't line up by what time your fucking flight is.  We don't line up by what time you start staying in your life.  And he's like, I'm going to miss my flight because you won't.  And I'm like, you're not me, so I don't care.  Because.  You're not my, you don't live in my body, so I won't be late. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Because it's the last guy in the chain of events that got this guy to the airport this late.  You.  Yeah.  No.  And even if it was, I still don't give a shit.  Yeah.  Who cares?  I don't care.  I got three hours.  But if I was late to the airport, I'd be like, I'm getting in front of you.  Yeah.  I'm not going to ask you.  Because it's me.  Yeah.  I'm going to figure this out.  All right.  Story of the day.  Sorry for that interruption there.  This is great.  Listen in.  We're going to begin with an attack on Long Island, and it is, frankly, beyond shocking. 
[03:03:30]  A developmentally disabled man, a bowling alley worker, viciously attacked by two teenagers,  sexually abused with a plumber's snake.  The two teenagers are now charged.  Who would do this and why?  It happened to the bowling alley in Shirley.  Wouldn't and why not?  I would assume supporter Jim Doan is for us tonight.  Jim?  Bill, first, a bit of a warning.  There just is no way to tell this.  Oh, that's great.  He's got to warn them.  He's dope. 
[03:04:00]  A bit of a warning.  By the way, I'm fucking, we're speechless here.  Wouldn't he put it?  He said, a bit of a warning.  There's no way to tell this without laughter.  Make him believe they're getting something done.  You can't.  Yeah.  There you go.  A bit of a warning.  Horrible, depraved story without being more graphic than any of us would like to be.  Keep in mind that the victim in this case is a 21-year-old developmentally disabled man  described here at the bowling alley by people as friendly and innocent. 
[03:04:30]  He is a maintenance worker who people here say would never hurt anyone.  But on Sunday night, according to police, he was followed into the men's room by two men,  one of whom held him down, and the other one sexually assaulted him with a plumber's tool.  I don't want any story about me, no part of any story about me to be described by people at the bowling alley as...  There is a great line here in the post...  Plumber's snake. 
[03:05:00]  ...where it says...  They're talking about the fallen maintenance employee of AMF Shirley Lanes into the bathroom.  He was a Shirley Lanes employee.  Shirley Lanes.  Shirley, your asshole, can't be sore.  And it says, as one teen held the victim down, the other forced the plumbing snake inside him and spun it several times.  Wow.  The man suffered severe pain, bleeding, and internal injury.  Wow.  See those things?  And a little bit of...  He's a little ashamed, too.  Probably a little...  He's a little embarrassed.  I don't care how developmentally challenged you are, that part of you is not... 
[03:05:30]  I may be retarded, but this is kind of a drag.  I really don't think this is right.  You ever think what these guys do right after a crazy act like that, before the cops discover what happened?  Like, ha ha, and then throw the snake down.  And then, what's the...  Ah.  So, why do we...  Ah, shit.  Did we just do that?  Yeah, did we just do that?  Yeah.  Did I just hold him down while you shoved that plumber snake up his ass? 
[03:06:00]  Dude, why do we do this?  Dude, do we...  Dude.  But how do they come to it?  Like, did one guy...  Well, that's what I wanted...  Because you look at the picture, they're like, these kids...  I get that you're, you know, you're a teenager, you're bored.  Yeah.  But how do you, you know...  Hey, my dad's got a plumber snake.  You know that retarded guy at the pool alley?  Why don't we get him in the bathroom, you hold him, and I'll snake it up his ass, and then, you know...  Ten minutes.  We'll do ten frames.  Like, what the fuck?  Got any quarters?  I want to play Miss Paxton. 
[03:06:30]  Hey, Jim in Jersey.  Jim!  Yo, I got a Pa from Moon Hockey line.  Okay.  I guess they gave him the old 7-10 split.  Yeah, that is a Pa from Moon Hockey line.  Devoid of humor.  There you go.  There's more to the story here.  Of course there is.  Oh, the reporter goes to the address of one of the suspects.  Oh, that's good.  At the address police sources give for one of those charged, nobody seemed to know Steven Rodriguez.  You know Mr. Rodriguez?  No.  Not at all? 
[03:07:00]  No.  No, not live here.  No.  No.  That takes balls going to the house.  Or a fucking bad job.  Sounds like the reporter might have a fetish.  That'd be great.  They'd grab the reporter, hold him down, and snake his ass.  I'll give you an exclusive.  My ass was snake as I tried to find Mr. Rodriguez.  It seems this more to meet the eye.  Yeah, this story didn't end here.  No.  It ended in my anus, and it goes on still. 
[03:07:30]  I'm Ernie and Ashton's reporting from my bed at Columbia Presbyterian on my stomach.  At least I'm not a retard working at the bowling alley.  Otherwise, in every other way.  Chris from Oklahoma City.  They pull out the snake, and there's just pennies and gum stuck to it.  Pennies and gum?  Jesus.  We're supposed to be sad here, guys.  Oh, yes.  Come on.  Maybe that's it. 
[03:08:00]  They were convinced there was something in his ass valuable, or that they lost.  Oh, yeah.  And they're just trying to help a guy out.  I gotta hear this guy again.  Nah!  At the address police sources give for one of those charged, nobody seemed to know Steven Rodriguez.  You know Mr. Rodriguez?  No.  Not at all?  No.  Police gave this address as where he lives.  Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't live here.  I just live in my system.  What a shitty reporter. 
[03:08:30]  What a great family.  No one seemed to know.  I asked one man who had no reason to know.  Who are you?  I'm just a plumber.  I lost a tool here.  I'm looking for my snake.  Somebody stole my snake.  I left it here.  The address is where he lives.  Well, I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't live here.  I'm just visiting my system.  What?  Did your sister know Mr. Rodriguez?  I have no idea.  Does Mr. Rodriguez live here?  I just got here from Florida.  I couldn't help you, dude.  And it's little wonder nobody admits knowing him. 
[03:09:00]  He is now charged in one of the most horrific...  He's not admitting it.  He's from Florida, you fucking adult.  He's not admitting it.  The guy instantly just accused him of lying.  And this lying sack of shit.  Do you still have to use the news...  It's no wonder.  Do you still have to use the news voice in a story like this?  Yeah, I know.  No one seems to know.  It's no wonder no one's saying he lives here.  Listen to the reporter's voice.  Rodriguez live here?  I just got here from Florida.  I couldn't help you, dude.  And it's little wonder nobody admits knowing him. 
[03:09:30]  He is now charged in one of the most horrific, one of the most heartless crimes in memory.  I don't know about heartless.  Yeah, I think that took a lot of heartless.  One hold them down, one does it, then they switch off.  Team effort?  Exactly.  Did he switch off your turn?  Yeah, come on.  I'm sick of holding him.  His back is sweating.  I thought retards were strong.  What a fucking docile nothing this guy was.  21.  21 years old, too.  Yeah.  Out of age, at least.  Yeah, at least it wasn't. 
[03:10:00]  Now they can claim it was consensual.  We didn't know.  He said, uh.  Okay, I love you.  Hey, Anthony, don't we have audio of the attack?  Oh, I think we might.  We have an exclusive on our show.  Actually, you know, it wasn't that bad for him.  Right.  It sounds like a horrific thing to happen to somebody, but he actually worked there.  He used to set the pins with his asshole.  Yeah.  So, it really didn't hurt him that much as I looked for the proper sound. 
[03:10:30]  I'm never fucking...  I think there was some microphones in the bathroom.  With a lucky break.  With a lucky break.  Actually, actually, I was thinking of audio before the act was committed. 
[03:11:00]  Oh.  I have no idea.  Let's see what's cooking in your mouth.  Let's see what's cooking in your mouth.  Oh, oh, oh, her.  Shit.  You mean it might have been that they wanted to check and see if he had some blockage of  some sort.  Actually, he just...  It wasn't even the whole act.  It was just the day.  He didn't want to do it on that day.  It's out Friday-wide.  Oh, Friday-wide.  Announcing when he's going to shit. 
[03:11:30]  So, yeah.  Oh, there...  All right.  What have you got cooking in your oven over here?  No, no.  You can't really hear our...  That's a fake laugh if I ever heard one.  All right.  Well, we got more details in the story.  Steve couldn't be happy about this.  And the most heinous act ever.  Heartless.  Heartless.  A mentally challenged man with a snake up his ass. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  More to the story here.  Of course.  A maintenance worker at the Shirley Lane's bowling alley, a 21-year-old developmentally disabled  man, was followed into the bathroom here and savagely sexually assaulted with a mechanical  plumbing device.  This guy's getting into it.  Anyone else hear that?  Savagely sexually assaulted. 
[03:12:30]  With a mechanical plumbing device.  Oh, fuck.  Lucky fella.  Plumbers have gone wild.  A plumbing device.  Plumbing.  The assault caused severe internal injuries, and the victim was found bleeding on the floor.  Charged in the attack were 19-year-old Stephen Rodriguez and 17-year-old Michael Lunsford,  both from Shirley and both men, now charged with aggravated sexual assault in the first degree.  No one with a bowling alley would talk with us on camera, but everyone here knows the victim, 
[03:13:00]  and everyone here now knows what happened to him.  There are obvious and unpleasant echoes in this case in the Abner Louima case, in which a police officer sexually assaulted a man with a stick, but this victim was developmentally disabled.  He was just 21 years old.  And also the plumbing, they don't even make the connection.  No.  It wasn't a stick, it was a plunger. 
[03:13:30]  It wasn't a stick, it was a fucking snake.  Yeah.  So it's like something about plumbing equipment makes people go, I gotta put this in somebody's  ass.  Now.  Wow.  The toilet's clogged.  Fuck.  I need to grab something and shove it up some guy's ass.  Tim from Connecticut, on the instant feedback, there's snakes, there's a motherfucking ass.  Snakes.  The fucking, oh yeah.  You know how filthy those things are?  He had the mind of a three-year-old and the asshole of a 38-year-old porn star.  Those things are filthy, too. 
[03:14:00]  You ever seen a plumber's, a plumber's snake thing?  They don't sit there and clean them off.  No, they wipe them down with a rag for a minute.  Yeah.  It's not like they boil them afterwards.  Disgusting.  It's not meant for the anus.  And then to spin it a few times, those things have like blades on them.  Yeah.  They have blades.  Well, if you're gonna stick it in, you gotta spin it.  You gotta spin it.  What's the whole point?  You gotta go to this.  You gotta go to this.  You gotta go to this.  You gotta go to this.  No.  It's just stupid.  Yeah.  It's a waste of time.  What's it look like?  Dude, we're here, let's spin the fucking thing.  Yeah.  It comes on a big reel.  Yeah, I don't know what that looks like.  And it feeds out, it's almost like metal conduit. 
[03:14:30]  It's like a coil spring.  And on the end of it is some kind of a blade that spins, so you could crank away on this thing.  It's meant to cut through, you know, century-old shit that's built up in pipes.  And what you do is feed it down.  Or a retarded man's asshole.  You feed it down the toilet as you crank the handle.  Or the retarded guy's asshole.  Or the retarded guy's asshole.  And it cleans it out. 
[03:15:00]  Dual purpose.  There you go, Jimmy.  There it is, Jimmy.  Look at this thing.  I'm thinking these guys, by the way, didn't do well on their SATs.  Nah, I'd like to.  Oh my God.  Now, why was the snake in the bathroom?  Well, maybe he had to go.  It's one of those things, like, they don't usually just have him laying around.  Well, he was probably going in there to fix a toilet.  There was a toilet full of diarrhea and shit and tampons that he was fixing.  Oh, so you think he being the maintenance guy.  So they went in there and they improvised.  Yeah, they said, hey, let's use what he's using. 
[03:15:30]  Well, they just saw the retarded man walking to the bathroom with the snake, and the one guy  went, are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Oh, my God.  And the one guy said, yeah.  And then he goes, as he's holding the guy down, putting it in his ass, the other guy's  like, I just thought he wanted to turn the lights off and run.  I didn't know we were going to rape another man who was developmentally disabled.  Johnny and Spionk.  Johnny. 
[03:16:00]  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, Johnny.  Have you ever been to this bowling alley?  It's a Shirley.  I mean, you talk about animals.  And I'm not just the Spanish guys either.  Just the white trash that's out there is terrible.  Yeah, Shirley is not really a nice place out of Long Island.  Oh, my God.  It's like Brentwood.  It's out at Exit 64.  Exit 64 of the expressway.  We're on Waiting River, right?  Yeah.  It's like the last bastion of, like, condos and things.  And then you pass that and you're out, you know. 
[03:16:30]  You're out on the island.  Wine country.  Right.  It's wine country.  Well, Shirley.  The retarded guy whining in the bathroom.  About this.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Johnny.  You got it.  Just a horrific story today.  All right.  And I think his life was going so great, too.  Yeah.  The retarded guy working in a bowling alley.  And Shirley.  And Shirley.  God, what a far tumble that was for him.  He's the only guy who ever had a snake in his asshole and it actually took him up on 
[03:17:00]  the social ladder.  He was on the radio.  I heard I was on O.B. Anthony, too.  It was kind of cool.  I got a retarded guy with a snake up his ass in Shirley.  Bigger than you.  All right.  We're going to break.  Louis C.K. in studio today.  Trump Marina Saturday.  Saturday night.  And Otto and George tonight at Comics here in New York City.  Yep.  C-O-M-I-X.  On 14th Street.  Let me pack your district with Nino Hartley. 
[03:17:30]  There you go.  All right.  Now getting your nails done could wind up doing a lot of damage.  How bad will the hurricanes feel?  A popular medicine for children now linked to seven deaths.  A common medicine could be turning people into compulsive gamblers.  And is there a hidden danger in your bag of microwave popcorn?  Oh, stop it.  Are your local reporters trying to scare you to death?  The Opie and Anthony Show wants to hear scary news teases from your town.  Send your audio to danny at foundrymusic.com.  That's danny at foundrymusic.com. 
[03:18:00]  Opie and Anthony.  We're talking about stingrays today.  Are we?  Yeah, I think we are now.  Because we hadn't up until now.  And that almost sounded like we've been talking about them all day.  I want them to think they missed something.  Oh, okay.  See?  I tore down the eighth wall. 
[03:18:30]  Another stingray story.  Yeah, these things are getting a little uppity.  Mm-hmm.  The stingrays.  It's all about the stingrays now.  So a stingray jumped in a guy's boat and...  Yeah, apparently.  Stabbed him in the heart.  And stabbed him in the heart.  Scary as that.  Yeah.  This is war now.  Yeah.  We're at war with the stingray population.  And we're losing.  Now they're coming up where we breathe.  Exactly.  That's bad.  Exactly.  An 81-year-old man survives a stingray attack similar to the one that killed crocodile hunter Steve Irwin. 
[03:19:00]  The stingray jumped into his boat off the coast of Florida, then stung him in the chest.  The leaping ray left a foot-long barb in the man's chest.  He underwent surgery to have to have it removed.  He's expected to make a full recovery.  Wildlife experts say this was a very unusual attack, and they say stingrays are normally peaceful animals.  All right.  Keep saying that.  Keep saying that.  You should see what two stingrays did in a bathroom in Shirley, New York.  In the boat.  Jumped up.  Jumped into the boat.  Take that, cack sucker.  Jumped out again. 
[03:19:30]  How does the 80-year-old guy get stabbed in the chest, and he lives, and this stupid Aussie  is, like, in shape, or, you know, running around the outback?  Fucking dies.  Yeah, he dies from the same thing.  By the way, we all got our copies of The Bridge.  The director is coming in tomorrow.  The poster looks even good.  I'm very jealous of my company.  The poster's creepy.  You got your copy, though?  No, no, it's coming in about 20 minutes.  Oh, okay.  We were talking about this over at Free FM today.  The director of The Bridge is coming in.  How many deaths? 
[03:20:00]  24?  I think 23 out of 24, something like that.  24, yeah, it said 24.  Boink, boink, boink, boink.  Fates of 24 people who died at the Golden Gate Bridge in 2004, linked together by a four-second  fall, but their lives have been moving on parallel tracks and similar arcs all along, because  they kind of look into these people, you know.  It would be kind of like a lunatics gone wild if they just showed people jumping, you know.  Here's a guy.  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  Check out this nut.  And with a do-do-do, whoop.  Yeah.  We're going to actually...  They just play this a bunch of times.  Whistling.  That would be wacky.  But they kind of get into these people's lives and what sends them to that final moment.  He wants us to feel for these people, right?  On the Golden Gate Bridge.  Yeah.  Apparently, this guy did his research and realized, hey, about that many people, 24 or 25  or so, every year kill themselves on the Golden Gate Bridge. 
[03:21:00]  It's been happening for years.  If I set up a camera and just keep it rolling constantly, I'm going to catch people killing  themselves.  What a great idea.  Brilliant.  So he did that and made a movie about it.  Very controversial.  Yeah, because the movie is so fucking long, but it's in real time.  I'm going to do a movie where I...  Wow.  Oh, okay.  That joke.  I heard somebody else did a movie where they set up a camera in a bathroom in a bowling  alley in Shirley.  Wait.  See how many they can catch.  There's like 50 raping.  Finally got pay dirt. 
[03:21:30]  At the end of the year, you find out.  Yeah.  Fucking constant.  A whole year of people peeing and throwing out garbage.  The guy's been taking a year.  He took the camera out the day before yesterday.  Fuck.  Nothing happens here.  Fuck.  All right.  Let's say hi to Casper.  Hey, Casper.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up?  I was watching Mythbusters last night.  Yeah.  They were talking about jumping off bridges and stuff, and they tried to throw the dummy  off the Golden Gate Bridge, and they weren't allowed to.  They couldn't, because he was in the bathroom having his asshole. 
[03:22:00]  Snake dummy.  So what they did was they dropped him from 150 feet off a crane, that dummy they got, and  they measured like almost 300 Gs on your body when you hit the water.  Oof.  That could do some damage, I think.  Definitely.  Almost as bad as a snake up your butt.  I'm thinking maybe a broken nose.  Later.  Perhaps a bit more than that, Opie.  Perhaps a road rash.  That was a myth?  Yeah, I know.  What myth were they busting?  Well, they're running out of myths.  Mythbusters was doing like myths that were urban legends, things that everybody knew, 
[03:22:30]  and now they're kind of like scrambling for things.  There's a myth that if you jump off the Golden Gate Bridge, you could be killed.  Let's find out.  I think that's a myth.  So they take a dummy, like a crash test dummy, and throw it off and get all kinds of readings  off of it.  Apparently.  Yeah.  Wow.  The data shows.  This was really surprising.  Your head would cave in.  Your head would become part of your anus.  Yeah.  It'd turn inside out.  Now someone is arguing, saying the ray didn't jump out of the boat. 
[03:23:00]  There's no way the ray would have jumped out of the boat.  It just can't happen.  What do you mean jumped out of the boat?  In the boat.  Jumped out into the boat.  Oh, out of the water into the boat.  There you go.  Okay.  Maybe he was fishing, and he had it on the line, and gave it a good tug, and came onto  the boat.  I don't know.  I don't know either.  They never give you enough details on those stories.  We want all the details.  We want the video.  All right.  So the guy from the bridge will be in tomorrow.  That's probably on YouTube already. 
[03:23:30]  That's going to be great.  I can't wait.  And I can't wait to see the movie tonight.  I got it.  I don't know if I'm...  For free.  I don't like things like that.  Not only do I like them, I adore them.  I don't like watching the violence.  I can watch smut and stuff.  Jimmy will go to, like, ogreish.com and those sites and watch the beheadings and things  like that.  I can't.  No.  Show me a Jap girl with shit coming out her ass in a wedding dress.  Amen.  And I'll watch it 80 times.  I watched some of those Iraq beheadings.  Oh, you did?  It's horrific.  Yeah.  It's burby on a very... 
[03:24:00]  The weirdest part, though, is how it always ends with they show the guy's head, and he's  got this dumb look on his face.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Look on the dude's face.  It's like a sitcom husband.  He was just screaming and screaming, and then he just looks like...  It's like one eye kind of...  Yeah, that's really a drag, man.  That's my edge.  I can't go there.  Wow.  The worst thing...  I haven't seen him, so, you know, I don't even...  You guys know how nutty my ex-girlfriend is.  They know Erin, my ex-girlfriend.  She's crazy, and she's very funny, and she's nuts.  Nothing fucking bugs this chick. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  She was over my part one time.  She's like, I want to see these videos.  I'm like, you don't want to see this.  No.  She got me to go to one.  I'm like, okay.  I put it on, and she was watching for 30 seconds.  She screamed.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  She physically did a...  Oh!  And fucking had to walk away from the computer.  Worst thing ever.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Ben, you fucked the shit out of her.  Yeah, I did.  Actually, while we were doing it.  That's why she screamed.  How'd you be stuck it in her ass?  I never made her feel good in bed.  I'm like, you were going to make a noise tonight.  Watch this.  Wow.  That's a whole new form. 
[03:25:00]  Make girls watch behaving videos while you fuck them.  While you're dogging her.  If they fly up, they get the same.  Let's try to sell that to NBC.  I think we have a hit on our hands.  But any of that shit, like the grotesque, people like, hey, this guy jumped off a fucking  building.  Check out this picture.  It's like, no.  I like that.  The sex stuff, anything goes.  I've watched that guy get killed by the horse, and that's kind of...  The guy's dying, but the horse is fucking him.  Come on.  That kind of outdoes the dying part. 
[03:25:30]  Exactly.  You feel sad, yet you have a raging erection.  But you said a Japanese girl with shit coming out of her ass is...  Yeah.  That's good?  It's not good.  It's not good, like, holy shit, I gotta see this.  What's wrong with just a Japanese girl?  Why does it have to be feces involved?  Because that was one I saw.  Oh, okay.  And, like, that stuff won't grow.  It'll gross me out.  Like, I'll be like, oh, that's disgusting, but I can watch it.  Yeah, he's trying to explain how far he could go with this stuff.  Yeah, that's, like, how far it goes, but it's all sex stuff.  Oh, I see.  Like, I can't take violence.  I like watching fights.  Like, that stuff.  You go onto YouTube and, you know, you watch two guys just beating the shit out of each other. 
[03:26:00]  That's fine, too.  But when it comes to, like, people killing...  Some of the ultimate fighting I can't watch.  And I can also watch our troops, videos of our troops killing insurgents.  Really?  Like, there's one of, I guess, a helicopter gunship just ripping apart about five guys.  One guy's trying to hide under a truck, and it's night vision.  They got footage.  Wow, cool.  And he crawls out a little bit, and you hear the guy go, hit him, hit him, and you see  pieces, because it's a heat signature. 
[03:26:30]  So you see hot pieces of this guy go flying on the street.  And that doesn't bother me, because, again, I don't know him, and it's far away.  Yeah, he's not you.  And it's not real enough, you know?  It's almost video game-ish.  It's only videos I couldn't watch on Oberst, and I could not do it.  It was a four-part series of a guy torturing a kitten.  What the fuck?  It was...  You could watch a beheading, but not kitten abuse?  I don't know why.  Little kitties.  I don't know why I couldn't watch it.  Not that I judge one is worse than the other.  Because humans aren't innocent of anything.  Animals are all innocent. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, I don't know.  Fuck off.  Sweet.  Well, yeah, because the guy...  Fuck off.  I thought we were getting some insight in it.  Fuck off.  I like kittens.  I like cute kittens, you cunt.  Your mother's cunties are a few of my favorite things.  But, no, I don't know if it's a love for animals.  I just couldn't watch it.  It just...  I saw part one of it, because I hated the guy doing it so much.  He didn't really hurt the kitten in the first one.  He spun it around.  He was fucking with it badly. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, God.  But they said it was graphic animal torture, and I couldn't watch it in three parts.  Couldn't do it.  Why would you do it?  I couldn't do it.  Why would you watch it?  He went to jail, though.  This would bug...  They don't get much time, no.  This is in Belgium.  A couple of months.  But Ogres took the videos down because of complaints from PETA, and it's like...  That was kind of odd.  There are beheadings.  Like, you'll leave the beheadings.  PETA's like, fuck the Iraqi beheadings.  But that, and that was the...  I like that they kowtow to PETA, too, of all.  Yeah.  The relatives of the beheaded... 
[03:28:00]  Fuck you, whore.  Could you take my son's death off of your sight, please?  Fuck you.  Wait a minute.  Cindy Crawford's on the line?  Oh, no.  Or whoever.  They're consistent.  They're protecting animals.  You know, the shower...  Let me tell you something, though.  Those kittens are adorable.  Yeah.  The shower scene in Psycho, they were more upset with the shot of a toilet bowl than they  were of the stabbing of Jared Lee.  They didn't want the toilet shown.  Why?  There's something about the bodily functions that was a problem.  Don't remind me that I shit every day. 
[03:28:30]  Kill a girl who hasn't wanted to.  No, that's true.  They're...  Yeah, they've had problems with bathrooms and mentioning bathrooms in TV for years, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone knows the water closet story with Jack Parr, I guess it was.  Jack Parr got in trouble for saying water closet on the old Tonight Show.  He was talking about something in the bathroom, not even going to the bathroom.  He mentioned...  He said water closet and got in all kinds of trouble saying that.  Imagine...  It's a fucking...  What a...  How uptight... 
[03:29:00]  Dick's in this freaking country.  All right.  Let's go to Matt in Dallas.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, yeah.  I don't know if you've seen this Japanese video with the Japanese girl with the eels.  You all seen that?  With the what?  With the eels.  Yeah.  Oh, the eels coming out of her?  Yeah.  We saw one on Paltop before with a squid falling out of a pussy, which is horrible.  Yeah, a whole squid just shoved in there and it looks like she's shitting it out.  But it's coming out of her pussy.  Is the squid alive?  And the squid is using three of its tentacles to hold its nose. 
[03:29:30]  That was a weird water skiing accident in her home.  It's like a fucking squid right now.  All right, guys.  Straight up her snatch.  Damn it.  That was tough.  All right.  Yeah, a friend used to feed...  That's...  You know, that's one thing.  That's sick, too.  I hate that.  Like feeding kittens to a snake if you have a pet like python that's 18 feet long.  Yeah.  That's one thing.  And you've got to have a weird head for that.  But even that doesn't equal the torture and like slow killing of an innocent little animal 
[03:30:00]  that's all cute and everything.  I saw one.  A fucking water buffalo you could just beat over the head all day with a sledgehammer.  Like who gives a shit?  I actually jerk off watching the last scene in Apocalypse Now.  Oh, and they're just cutting apart that fucking water buffalo in Apocalypse.  Nobody cares.  No one cares.  Kittens, though, their foreheads are too big for their face.  It's adorable.  That's funny.  I'll tell you an awful one I saw.  And I didn't know how bad this was because it was on Consumption Junction. 
[03:30:30]  There was two guys who, again, I would just love to strangle these guys.  And there was a cat inside of like a little cage that it couldn't move in.  It was like trapped in this little cage.  And they doused it with fucking gas and set it on fire and videotaped it.  It was just awful, the sounds it was making.  It was horrible.  I can't comprehend doing that.  You don't have to watch these.  I know, I know.  And watching them, I think, is affecting you even though you don't think it is.  Yeah, that's why I don't watch that.  I mean, I watch those beheadings and I regret it.  Yeah.  And I don't watch that stuff anymore. 
[03:31:00]  I had nightmares over those.  I had nightmares over those.  All I saw was a still, the closest I saw of a beheading was a still picture of the head  on the guy's back.  Yeah.  How they put it on the back.  I saw one still picture of that for a split second and the image is still too clear in  my head.  No.  I remember every detail from those days.  Yeah.  See, it fucks you up, Jimmy.  Yeah, it does.  Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stop it.  Don't do it.  I should watch happier videos.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Where's the old shit in the mouth stuff I used to download?  The good old days.  The happy days. 
[03:31:30]  Otto, can you watch that stuff?  I've never seen a beheading video.  Yeah.  I remember seeing that guy shoot himself in the mouth.  Or Bud Dwyer.  That stayed with me for a couple of days.  That was a bad one.  The worst thing about the beheading was the guy screaming, and then they cut his throat  so it goes from hearing his voice to just hearing wind coming out of his fucking air  coming out of his head.  God damn.  He was gasping for he couldn't breathe, obviously.  Yeah.  That was it.  It was like, whoa.  He just becomes lungs pushing air out of him.  See, that seemed bad enough.  Like, you're just saying this? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, sorry.  I can't take it.  It was horrible.  Oh, man.  Not even in a funny way.  It was like disturbing.  In a funny way.  Not even funny.  No, but I mean, that's how bad it was.  Not like, like, when you think, you know, if they had put a clown hat on him.  That's what his family said at the funeral.  That wasn't even funny.  At least if it had been funny.  Did you even laugh?  No, I gotta tell you, I didn't.  I gotta be honest with you.  It wasn't even funny.  Didn't even laugh.  You know what I mean.  Brian from Grand Rapids.  Hey, Opie, fill with Norm Audio on Daily Show.  I sent it to Steve.  Is that the Norm MacDonald? 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, that's what, uh, that, you know.  Daily Show was the thing I saw, yeah.  Oh, okay.  We should, you were just talking about that during the break, so we should maybe play that.  Maybe Steve could bring that in.  Uh, NFL Stadium terror threat, yes.  What?  This is...  Maybe you were right.  Maybe you did see sharpshooters.  Huh?  You said you saw sharpshooters.  No one wanted to listen to me the other day.  I told you.  He said he saw sharpshooters on the roof of Giant Stadium, and some guy called us and goes,  Oh, really?  There is no roof on Giant Stadium.  And then we gotta explain that there is a little perimeter.  It's not the fucking idiot.  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  You gotta explain the dumbest things to people.  Oh, God.  The dumbest dummies.  I love that he called.  I'm gonna call, because that's a slight error in vernacular.  We get it every day.  There ain't a roof every day.  Terrorists threatening to target seven NFL games this Sunday.  Homeland Security officials aren't putting much stock behind the online threat, but they're  still warning stadiums from New Jersey to Seattle to be on alert.  Fox News' Catherine Craig is in East Rutherford right now with more.  So what is this threat, Catherine?  Well, Lucy, basically it's an internet posting warning that those seven stadiums that you just 
[03:33:30]  saw from here at the Meadowlands to Seattle to Cincinnati down at Houston, basically that  they will be hit with dirty bombs.  If you have tickets to go for games at any of those stadiums, local and national elected  leaders are saying that you should go and you should feel safe.  Right now, Homeland Security says you can't expect extra safety checks and increased patrols  at Giant Stadium and the six other NFL stadiums around the country.  You should go.  You should go. 
[03:34:00]  Exactly.  I'm saying that.  I felt safe until I turned the TV on this morning.  It's one dirty bomb and it's on the end of a plumber snake.  The department says it issued the warning just to be cautious, but Homeland Security  is skeptical about the validity of the threat.  The internet posting was discovered a week ago.  Local congressman Peter King, who also runs the Homeland Security Committee, says if you're  going to the Meadowlands this weekend for the Jets game, you should feel safe.  If I had tickets for the game on Sunday, I'd go to the game. 
[03:34:30]  I mean, I'm very confident nothing's going to happen.  But on the other hand, in the world in which we live today, every threat has to be looked  at and we have to be cautious, we have to be prudent.  Do you want tickets?  No, I'd go to the game.  And the people who run Giant Stadium, where we are, tell us this is a well-protected  force, so they already have advanced security screening systems in place.  How do you get me to be cautious and go at the same time?  They scared you, yet told you everything's fine.  You should totally go.  Then why talk about it? 
[03:35:00]  There's threats out there.  Eh, they're not credible.  Go to the game.  Go to the game.  Have fun.  Homeland Security guy said if he had tickets, he'd go.  When was the last time they detonated a bomb in this country?  Like, never?  I mean, it was like...  Yeah, not legitimately.  Yeah.  It was one of our own.  But now you have that in the back of your head.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks to the news.  Dirty bomb.  Yeah.  It's even worse.  No, that's the only thing that ever happened.  Yeah.  September 11th.  Except for the thing that one of our guys did.  Yeah, that domestic shit.  Also, the 93-tree-tree had a bomb and they just didn't do right. 
[03:35:30]  What?  The 93-tree-tree had a bomb and they just didn't do right.  The 93-tree-tree had a bomb.  The 93-tree-tree was just targeting certain people, though.  He didn't go to, like, crowded stadiums.  Right, right, right.  He was all right.  This is awful to say.  He was all right.  Allegedly awful to say.  But, you know, September 11th and how Ground Zero is hallowed ground.  Yeah.  Do we have to pretend that there were no assholes in those buildings?  There wasn't a single-shit-asshole.  Like, before it happened, I never stopped at those buildings and went,  oh, keep it up, you sweethearts.  Love that place, and everyone in it, hope nothing ever happens to them. 
[03:36:00]  And every favorite people, those two buildings.  Yeah, every couple was in love, right?  Yeah, there was probably a vicious divorce case going on.  There wasn't one couple that was a single asshole.  A day away from filing divorce?  Yeah.  Do you think there was one bitter ex-husband who went, look, it's a tragedy,  but, you know, she was a cunt.  Yeah, I took out a couple of Janine Garofalo fans up there.  Yeah, in hindsight, with enough time going by, you can bring that up, you know.  I'm sure there were a few pricks working there. 
[03:36:30]  I always don't measure, like, I think you can measure how bad a person you are  by how soon you masturbated after the planes hit.  Like, what's the first time?  Was it like a month after?  That's a good gauge.  Between the two buildings collapsing, which is probably a bad sign that I had to.  I had to, because otherwise they win, you know, the terrorists.  Right.  You've got to go on with our lives.  Keep shopping, keep jerking off, don't let them win.  That's true.  Keep it up.  Jerry. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  Hi, Jer.  Jimmy, I have a question for you, my idol.  Okay.  Last night I had an escort service come to the hotel room, and she charged me $100.  I don't know, we just kind of sat around and talked for a little bit, and then we got down to business.  She gave out prices.  First was $40 for a blowjob, $80 for just sex.  Where'd you find this fucking bargain?  Denver. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, wow, funny, I'll be there next week.  So it was $40 for a blowjob, $80 for sex.  What was the $100 for?  Everything.  Blowjob and sex.  Wait, is that in addition to the $100 or no?  No, it was just $40 for a blowjob, and then it jumped up to $80 for sex, and then it was just $100 for both.  What the fuck is this question?  What's the question?  Yeah, what is your question?  What'd she look like?  Was she awful?  I'm telling everybody.  The question is great.  It says, Jim, is $100 too much for a hooker? 
[03:38:00]  Dude, that's not even close to enough.  Because I don't know, I'm afraid that diseases are getting robbed, so I've paid more than that for hand jobs.  But again, is it too much for a hooker?  No.  No, it's not.  I paid $7 and two cigarettes once to get blown by a chick on the way home from Plainfield, New Jersey, when I was like 20.  But you eat raw cashews.  Yeah, I'm trying to eat healthy now, but I don't know.  Think of what you could do with that $7 if you had it today in the cigarette.  Hey, those cigarettes, thank God, my lungs are a little healthier.  Here, here.  Well, I've never done such a thing like that, and I figured, well, I want to be like my idol. 
[03:38:30]  I've never done such a thing.  Way to describe a 1932 vernacular.  I've never done such a thing.  Well, I never.  I never.  Put my monocle back in.  Yeah.  That's right.  And bring my slave.  You and your whole fucking family, Carleone.  So was it good for you, Jerry?  Yeah, I think it was worth my half hour.  Half hour?  Was she hot?  Half hour. 
[03:39:00]  Stood about five, six, maybe 110 pounds.  Eight stone.  Fifteen hands high.  Nice little perky kiddies.  Where was she from?  Was she from down the road, a spell?  Good set of teeth.  Like he's trying to sell a Negro.  I am, by the way.  Jerry? 
[03:39:30]  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think your answer is no, it's not too much for a hooker.  Why is Norton your idol?  For his comedy skills or for just liking prostitutes?  We're seeing both.  Yeah.  Besides Opie and Anthony being funny, he's the funniest comedian that comes in.  Right.  Thank you.  Well, I'm not coming in from here.  He's here.  Why don't you ask him about Richard Pryor or something?  What are you asking about hookers for you?  Yeah.  Creep.  I don't know, because Jimmy is an expert on that subject.  Well, he's got a point. 
[03:40:00]  His parents are listening.  Yes.  Fucking asshole.  Yes.  My father would probably say 100 is too much for a blowjob, but mom would say, no, it's  not.  Yeah.  Mom would say ass play.  Anything for you, Jimmy.  Only if ass play involved.  Jimmy, once your mom say you have a nice gym downstairs.  A nice one.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  You're bombing.  Don't really.  I actually don't.  It's funny.  I did take mom's advice, and that's why I started working out.  Mom's advice changed my life.  Oh, my God.  It's from way back.  I forgot about that. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Mommy loves you.  We just remembered the voicemail, but I forgot that it led to you actually working out.  It changed my life.  My mother left me a voicemail.  She heard me on the show one time talking about prostitutes.  Yeah.  Wait, Louie, have you ever heard this?  What?  No.  It was 30 seconds.  We haven't played this in a while.  We got it.  It's a real voicemail from my mother that I saved and put on my CD.  And she had heard you talking about prostitutes on the radio.  Yeah.  On this show.  Yeah.  So how did that lead to working out?  Well, I'll tell you, this is the voicemail she left.  It's great.  It's a real voicemail.  She was really embarrassed that I played it.  They're running around.  No one's really working behind the scenes today. 
[03:41:00]  You remember one time when Jimmy and I were working on my show, and Jerry Miner, who played  my neighbor across the hall, we were all eating bacon.  You know, there's always a table of just bacon, a whole table.  And we're just eating it, and I'm just making myself sick.  And I'm like, oh, God, I fucking hate myself.  Just eating bacon, just making my body hate me more.  And Jim does one of his corny things.  He says, everything in moderation, Lou.  And then so I said, really, everything, like, that goes for anything?  Like fucking your mom in the ass in moderation? 
[03:41:30]  And then I said that, and then Jerry Miner, like, does a motion of a mother getting fucked  in the ass and goes, not too much now, dear.  Like your mom telling you.  Oh, shit.  We got the phone call?  Oh, we got it now?  All right, so this is really Jim's mom.  Okay.  Leaving a voice.  A couple years ago.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here.  But we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful 
[03:42:00]  thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says, replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs.  And, you know, just for like 20 minutes to half an hour, and you would feel better.  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise.  And you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up.  And you relieve, you know, tension and stuff.  And you'd be meeting other people. 
[03:42:30]  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange.  But I am a mother, and I worry about you.  You're doing so well.  Everything is falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interstate this on your mother.  I'm taking a special license. 
[03:43:00]  But anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Peace.  Bye-bye.  I want to cry.  I want to cry.  That's the best mother I ever heard.  Is she nice?  When you listen to that, she says, though, don't be mad at me.  Like, he goes home and, what the fuck did you do, bitch?  That's what I'm saying to you.  But it's so sweet.  Like, you picture it playing while, you know, like in Apocalypse Now, you're laying there  dead, like, cleansed paper.  Oh, God.  Anyway, sweet, you're laying there riddled by bullets. 
[03:43:30]  That's it.  Get your hiney out of the way of the bullets.  Can't bring your hiney home.  Oh, damn.  That's good.  We're going to get you a new car, but that's a secret.  And avoid prostitutes.  Ha, ha.  Yeah.  It's just ha, ha.  That laugh.  Bullet riddled body.  Oh, that's so nice.  You see what he was protecting?  It was a fucking hooker.  Oh, my God.  That's so sweet.  Yeah.  I like also, just like every mother of a grown person, it starts with, hey, everybody's 
[03:44:00]  fine.  Everybody's fine.  You just know your mother calls.  Every time I see my mother, I'll say, who's dead?  Yeah.  Otherwise, don't fucking bother me, mom.  It's a death call.  Yeah.  We get along really good, though.  I mean, my parents are, like, really cool.  They like their day.  She's right, too.  Of course, she is.  She does good advice.  They love the show, and my dad loves the sex story.  He doesn't care.  But she was right.  I did take the advice.  I was like, God damn, my mother.  I don't think you were going to take the advice.  See, that's what a mother hears her son talking about, like, you know, shitting in  hookers' mouths, and she just thinks, he needs to exercise, my boy. 
[03:44:30]  He needs, I think that's what he needs.  Isn't that fantastic?  That is so awesome.  Innocent ignorance of a mom.  No.  That's the way they think.  They'll defend any boy.  She said at one point, she goes, you know, you'll tone up, and she was kind of saying,  look, look, I do understand why you have to pay for it, but maybe if you're probably  just fat tits, score a little free box.  That was a loving mother's way of saying it.  Exactly.  Oh, you think that that's what you meant by?  Put the money into a health club. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  You might actually.  You'll meet some people.  Might get to fuck somebody who's not chewing gum while you're.  Yeah, maybe if your tits weren't showing in an XL shirt, you'd meet a girl for free,  fat fuck.  You and your deep belly button.  And you've been working out ever since?  Yeah, man.  I fucking, I did, I did, I hate when I miss it now.  I did yesterday, I hit the heavy bag a lot, now I did fucking 10 rounds in a bag, and  I, you know, fucking a little bit.  How many pounds did you drop?  I don't weigh myself.  I don't know, because I.  Yeah, I don't do that either.  I work out, but I don't care about the number.  I just kind of like want to see where my stomach is at, and it's all eating, and I'm fucking, 
[03:45:30]  it's hard to eat right, man.  It's fucking.  I just do it to feel better.  I just do it to have stamina and feel like a person.  Do you know a massage therapist in L.A. changed me, too?  I was, I went out, I was in L.A. shooting, luckily, and I fucking, I went to a massage  therapist one time, and she wouldn't jerk me, she wasn't her thing, but she would have  for like a thousand, and I was like, that's crazy.  And as she's massaging me, she goes, you know, she said something about you might want  to, she was just trying to exercise, because you don't want to be the guy that girls just  fuck for money.  And she was basically saying, like, look at you, because I was heavy when we were shooting.  Wow.  But you were close, and here's the thing, you were close enough to be told that, because she's 
[03:46:00]  not going to tell every fucking disgusting guy that, because they're fucking, you know,  because he's going to die that way.  No, that was pure.  But she looks at you, and she goes, if he worked out, he could just crawl over to the  other side of only fucked for money.  No, that was pure rage, because she's an ex-fat girl, and she was really trying to hurt  my feelings.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because she had a little dog running around the hall.  Oh, that's what you mean.  How do you know she was ex-fat?  She told me, she lost a lot of weight.  And here's a word of advice, if you're going to get a massage, you're not going to get jerked  off if they're allowing their small dog to run to the apartment.  That's never going to fucking end with a fucking load being shot. 
[03:46:30]  So you went to her apartment for the massage?  Yeah, but she-  How are you not just going to strangle her?  She didn't, but I guess they have a, she didn't have a doorman.  Oh.  She didn't have a doorman.  She didn't know.  But no, it actually turned out to be an okay massage, and she'll never know, but she helped  me.  Did you give her a thousand for the jerk?  I wouldn't give her a thousand for an ass fuck and 800 back.  Oh.  Let's go to Trisha, Alabama.  Trisha, Bama.  Hi.  Hey.  Hi, I'm a truck driver.  I weigh 420.  My husband's been trying to feed me to get up to like 441. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  And we got a load coming, leaving Monday out of California up to New York.  It's called Trisha.  When your husband goes food shopping and puts the groceries away, does he have to hire a rodeo  clown to distract you?  No, he's been feeding me all them truck stop food.  Fat pig selfish fool. 
[03:47:30]  He's been feeding me all them truck stop food like that cowboy.  Rotten oinker.  Let me explain what's going on here.  Trisha is 420 pounds, and our current leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is 430, so she's  stuffing her face because she wants to win the contest.  Yeah.  My husband said we can use that money, so he's been trying to feed me all the time, and  I'm just about puking.  He got ding-dongs in the truck, and he's been feeding me. 
[03:48:00]  He got ding-dongs in the truck.  Sounds like a metaphor for something.  He's got ding-dongs in the truck, if you know what I'm saying.  We do that, too.  He likes to.  After an August run in that truck, her seat must smell like a fucking Haitian refugee tent.  I'm douche.  You douche?  I was kind of saying that your butt cracked just from being sweaty.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I can reach back there still.  Oh, God.  You can?  That's great.  Barely.  You'll be in the Olympics soon.  Biscuits and burgers. 
[03:48:30]  That's amazing.  She can wipe her ass.  On her way to a gold.  Yeah.  She's going to be fucking getting shot put gold.  Oh, shit.  So, you guys coming to New York?  Yeah, we're supposed to deliver there on Wednesday.  They've got to bring her in through the tunnel like those elephants in the circus.  She has to hold on to the telepronation.  They've got to close the Lincoln Tunnel to walk her through.  Oh, God.  Oh, just eating hay and shitting while she's talking. 
[03:49:00]  Those are impact tremors.  Oh, we're teasing, darling.  Yeah, of course.  So, when do you come in?  On Wednesday.  Wednesday, okay.  A lot of girls promising to come in next week.  We'll see what happens.  We hear a lot of talk.  We don't see a lot of fat.  That's right.  So, come in.  Come on in.  We'll be nice to you.  You'll have fun either way.  Ten bucks a pound.  Yeah, we're good like that.  All right?  Okay.  Enjoy dying young.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hold on the line.  We'll give you some info. 
[03:49:30]  Otto had a really great line one time.  I think it was like a really fat woman walking, and we were doing the walkover, and Otto says,  do you like to play peekaboo with the Grim Reaper?  Oh, is that a good one?  Maybe you should give him like 12 a pound or something.  You know, it's pretty humiliating when you're asking from him.  Yeah.  We are, but you know what?  There's a finder's fee, too.  Fuck yeah.  A thousand bucks, and they get 10 bucks a pound, 400 something pounds. 
[03:50:00]  That's $4,500.  It's like a big game hunter.  Just to be you.  You get a finder's fee for bringing this slob down.  And their face would be obscured the whole time, right?  By a pig mask.  By a pig mask.  And a horse like people that used to take rich guys in the 1800s to go find game and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to see a very fat woman, right?  Oh, yes, boss.  I'm going to show you a very fat man.  Yes.  She's a truck driver.  Buona.  Buona.  She's a big fat woman.  Yeah.  White hunter, fat fuck.  This show, you know what we were like? 
[03:50:30]  We're like the guy in The Elephant Man that brought the people to laugh at John Merrick  and drink.  Yeah.  And pour alcohol on them.  And what was wrong with him?  And nothing at all.  Nothing.  I love when he gets his fucking, when he gets his fucking shaving kit and he opens it  and he tries to comb his hair and dab on cologne.  Because he's a classy guy.  He wants to go meet the princess.  That huge head.  He died sleeping with his zilch.  He finally gets it.  He just wanted to live.  He just wanted to live. 
[03:51:00]  He just wanted to sleep on a pillow like the boy in the picture.  All right, listen.  Norm MacDonald.  Actually, you brought this up during the break, but they were listening to us on Pal Talk,  so now maybe we should do this.  You said Norm MacDonald and the Stingrays?  Really funny.  Funny joke on the, you know.  On what?  The Daily Show?  Yeah, on the Daily Show.  This was sent in by Brian from Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I wanted to talk about the Crocodile Hunter.  Did you?  Because I think.  Yeah, you're going to make him sad.  Because I think, you know, it was tragic at the time. 
[03:51:30]  But I think.  I don't know.  People call him and then they're shocked.  Oh, hey.  You wouldn't believe it.  Who got killed.  The Crocodile Hunter.  Please don't make me laugh at this.  Because they were like, he was 44 years old.  I'm like, that's a ripe old age for a crocodile.  And you know who had to be pissed about it were the crocodiles. 
[03:52:00]  Because he got killed by some fruity fish.  So you know, you know the crocodiles were like, hey man, that crocodile hunter got killed.  Who did it, Frank?  You know, you don't even want to know, man.  Bill, man, you had a chance. 
[03:52:30]  The guy go, man, I had a chance.  I had that mother.  He was, he was timing with a stick.  I could eat him and his kid.  I don't feel good about this.  Do you remember I ever tell you that story, Bill?  Yeah, only a thousand times.  That's true of the kids.  All right, Norma Donnell.  We're putting it on.  That is goddamn hilarious.  Very funny.  Jimmy, did you let one out? 
[03:53:00]  No.  Yeah, I smelled that shit, man.  Come on, Jimmy.  Come on, Jimmy.  What time is it?  Oh, it was bad.  He gets scared.  I'm getting nervous.  All the guys made me nervous.  I need something.  It's from the soup, Nauti's.  Okra soup over there.  Thank you, man.  Fucking disgusting.  Spray it in your eyes.  God, fucking Febreze.  I didn't see shit.  I didn't see shit on the menu.  Shit puree.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  That's good.  Much better.  Spray it right into the mic and then just smell the mic. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  It's like being a fucking, one of those CSI guys where you gotta put the Vicks under your  nose because the body's been rotting for three months.  That's what comes out of Jimmy's ass.  We're already in a soundproof room.  It's not nice.  No.  You guys want to talk to Patty before we get out of here?  Patty.  Patty's here?  Yeah.  What is she here for?  A couple minutes.  I got a Paltalk shirt.  And then we're going to do line of the day and get the hell out of here.  Patty, by the way, is a 51-year-old, I guess she is now, 51-year-old virgin.  She has never had sex in her life. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, why would the mic be on?  Yeah, wait until the mic's on.  It's on.  When you hold the mic, could you cup the bottom of it?  Sorry.  I want to see what it would look like.  No, I mean, see, she has no idea where the balls would be.  I don't know.  Where would balls be on that if that was a cock?  Here.  No.  Right in the middle of the shaft.  In the middle of your shaft are your balls, people.  Like a twig.  If they hang any lower, please get to an emergency room.  Your balls belong in the middle of your dick.  Right below the head.  You stupid ass.  Don't you understand they'd be... 
[03:54:30]  I haven't seen too much of that.  That shaft, let's say, is an entire cock.  Where would the balls be?  With an XM box on the top.  Here.  Now, cup underneath.  Like that?  There you go.  Yes, like both...  Like you're praying.  Like you're praying that it would stop, because it's your uncle.  And you're 12.  Yeah.  Now, what are you here for?  Anything special?  No.  Just went over for the walkover.  Haven't been for a little while.  And worked a lot of mornings.  So, I had my first day off in about six days. 
[03:55:00]  So, I decided to do the walkover.  Why didn't you go to Atlantic City?  Take the jitney.  I haven't been there in a while.  No.  And, like, that's once in a very, very blue...  You're on a losing streak.  51 years.  That's right.  Yeah.  You go there and play the walkover.  How would you drive back from Cleveland?  I remember talking to you about that.  Oh.  It was nice.  Yeah.  Drive back from Cleveland.  Nice eight-hour trip. 
[03:55:30]  It's nice.  On a bus?  No.  In a car.  Yeah.  With Pat from Monaki and with no filter, Paul.  Why are you talking like you're digital and it's breaking up?  With Pat from Monaki and Paul?  Yeah.  Oof.  What were you doing in Cleveland?  I was at the virus show.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I was in the petting zoo, which I loved.  That was so cute.  They put a few of the pests in the petting zoo and people got to spit on them and do whatever  they want to.  No.  People were, like, going, like, petting the top of my head and going, oh, did you get 
[03:56:00]  those fucking gums, Chernobyl?  God damn it.  Yeah, I know.  Doesn't it look like rolled up hubba bubba and chiclets?  Yeah.  Now you think that's a B.  Miss Virus at the PNC Bank Arts Center, too.  Well, that was a joke.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  Oh, my God.  I didn't even know about it.  You know when people were petting your hair, they were giving you stink finger first and  then petting you on the head?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Your head smelled like a plumber snake in Shirley. 
[03:56:30]  No, it didn't.  Oh, God.  Anything else?  Anything, yeah.  No.  How's work?  Nothing new in your life?  Yeah, I just got my first raise.  Oh, you got a raise?  Almost perfect rating on my evaluation.  Where are you working now?  What do you do?  At Starbucks.  Oh, yeah.  What do they evaluate you on?  Oh, your work performance and everything.  And out of a 3.0, which is the highest you can go, I had a 2.9-something.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's mediocre.  Everyone does that. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, what do they want you to work on?  You know, that'll get you laid eventually.  I'll just be a little faster at the drink bar and that's about it.  Is that 12 plus?  That person's 1834.  That's a good pickup line.  It's rated.  With a guy.  You know I got a 2.9 on my Starbucks.  Yeah, my Starbucks.  Performance rating.  Evaluation.  That'll get you something.  That falls right below.  I have polyps on my cunt.  Do you know what that means, Patty?  Oh, look.  I think you're on the verge of a break.  Something's going to happen for you. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  A couple more presidents, you'll be.  Yeah.  You got that right.  Let me tell you how this is going to end.  Some angry criminal robbing the register, holding her head under the coffee, and just  fucking pouring scalding coffee on the side of her face.  Open the safe.  There we go.  Open the safe.  I don't know the number.  They don't give it to us.  It's a 3.8.  I don't know the combination.  How much do you make now with the raise?  Well, I make 9.70. 
[03:58:00]  How much do you make?  Oh, wow.  8.75.  Wow.  95 cent raise?  It's not bad.  They couldn't give you a buck raise?  They had to go with 95 cents?  95 cents.  How about a buck?  Hey, that's a good one.  Most places I can't just give you 5 cents or a quarter.  You walk back in that fucking place and go, this place isn't called Star 95 Cents, asshole.  I want a buck, you fucking cheapskate.  That's right.  Oh, I'm very happy.  I really am.  I'm very satisfied.  Well, she said most places give it 10 cents.  Not only that, but I got two retirement funds. 
[03:58:30]  Hold on.  10 cents?  Where else have you worked?  In fucking prison?  Yeah.  10 cents.  What do you mean you got two retirement funds?  Yeah, I have a floral one with the Dallas, and I also have a SIP fund, and now I even  have a little stock.  You have a what fund?  I have a SIP fund, which is like they take money out of that and they buy stock for you.  Oh, that's great.  This wonderful guy that used to work at this place called Enron, he's running the funds.  No, no, no.  Nothing will ever happen.  In 10 years, I'm going to do pretty good with the pension and everything. 
[03:59:00]  Make it 10 years off the pension.  I have no idea.  Yeah, I don't know yet.  I don't know how to calculate stuff like that.  Have you ever thought of falling in love with a death row prisoner?  I mean, there's usually something there, you know?  No, don't worry.  There'll be a match for me someday.  Have you ever worked at any place in your entire life for 10 years?  Everything yogurt for 25 years.  You were at Everything Yogurt for 25 years? 
[03:59:30]  Did you just say 25 years?  Well, actually, no.  I started in 1980 and now I just help my friend out in this franchise once in a while.  Did they give you a gold yogurt lid when you left?  No, they give you a gold shotgun that you can point at yourself.  Oh, God.  I have an employee of the year plaque from 1986.  Apparently, your streak ran out, though.  That's the year after I graduated high school. 
[04:00:00]  You were getting an employee of the month.  Employee of the month at fucking Everything Yogurt.  What happened here?  Oh, this country is a fucking giant, smelly vagina full of shitty people.  By the way, if I do the math, you were 31 in 86?  Yes, I was.  That's Everything Yogurt getting the employee of the year.  What happened at Everything Yogurt?  That was 20 years ago this year.  20 years ago.  Well, nothing happened.  The company was changed over into other hands and I just moved on, but I still help my friend  out once in a while in New Jersey.  What did you move on to?  Golden Gate Bridge. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, no.  No, it's just been a change in partners in the company.  Hold on, hold on.  There's nothing wrong with getting an employee of the month at Everything Yogurt in 1986,  but 20 years later, it's still the story you're telling.  Patty, Everything Yogurt, 25 years, and then what?  What was the next move for you?  Well, after that, it was, well, I also worked another job while I was at Everything Yogurt.  All right, but Everything Yogurt, 25 years, what was the next gig?  I worked at Burger King for-  That's a jump off. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  I love Burger King.  I worked at Nathan's, which I, you know-  You're just like one of those fucking ants that bring the cricket down into the hole,  aren't you?  You're just fucking food service industry.  That's all you are.  Anything yogurt equals nothing life.  Yeah.  Don't you think, like, that's 25 years of my fucking life, and what do you have to show  for your 25 years at Everything Yogurt?  Did you get, besides the plaque, did you get any kind of like, wow, you-  How much money you made in 25 years at Everything Yogurt? 
[04:01:30]  No.  They said, look at our name.  It's Everything Yogurt.  We don't give you anything.  How much?  I started off around $3 an hour, $3.50 an hour.  The minimum wage was that low then.  And all the yogurt you could pump into your head, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't give a shit.  They just don't give a shit.  No.  It doesn't matter.  25 years, what is it?  It means shit.  It means nothing.  $3,000 for a life.  If you went to 50, 18-year-old kids or 14-year-old kids who would have done the same thing.  They don't care.  They don't care.  Not at all.  This is a neglected American.  And she's moved on and on from that. 
[04:02:00]  McDonald's this, and now she's just at Starbucks.  No one's taking care of it.  And again, she's like, this is great, Starbucks.  And you know what's going to happen, Patty?  It's the first time I've ever had benefits.  But they're taking care of you, right?  Yes, they are.  They're very good to their employees.  They're really selective with my diet.  And you worked at Godiva Chocolates, too.  Yeah, I did.  That was my favorite job that you had, because she used to bring Godiva Chocolates up.  Yeah.  She was a perfect employee for Godiva, and they kicked her out the door.  Why?  Because a change of managers, and the new manager didn't like me. 
[04:02:30]  Why did he not like you?  No one likes you.  No, I don't know.  I probably knew too much.  Well, that fucked up shit going on at Godiva.  Yeah, I knew too much.  Fucking bullshit at Godiva.  Just say what the cherry-filled chocolates are made with.  Those are actually tiny miscarriages.  Oh, God.  You know too much.  It's actually more expensive than cherry chocolates, but the fucking owners.  The dumpster at Planned Parenthood with his ladle of fucking chocolate. 
[04:03:00]  I'm telling everybody.  Yeah.  You're fired.  No one will listen to you.  It's a breaking story.  Hey, there's a job over here.  Go back to yogurt, you fucking...  Yeah.  There's a job opening in a bowling alley.  Yeah.  That's right.  Thank you.  I'm happy where I am.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think I'm going to retire at Starbucks.  25 years of yogurt.  What is that?  Some kind of sick joke?  I'm healthy.  All right.  Well, outside of my heart condition, I'm healthy. 
[04:03:30]  Well.  Jesus.  Heart condition.  The only thing I have to do is with my latest test, I am developing osteoarthritis, which  is common for my age, and I'm going to get therapy and do exercises for it.  How about some spermatozoa?  Some protein from some fucking giz?  You really have nothing to lose, man.  Why aren't you getting any, like, sex?  You've gone your whole life without sex.  Don't you think that might help?  Yeah.  Mentally, physically, emotionally?  Yeah, when I meet the right person. 
[04:04:00]  Right person.  You're 51 fucking years old.  Who are you waiting for?  Just turn into a size queen.  Do you date?  Do you date?  Enjoy the last five years.  I haven't had an opportunity to meet too many people.  No dates.  I don't go out very much.  I go home.  I watch my DVD.  Are you using that vibrator we got you?  Are you?  Be honest.  I'm too embarrassed.  Oh, come on.  That's a yes.  How many times a week?  I'm embarrassed.  How many times a week?  It's good, though.  It's good you're doing that.  You're using that?  It's a good release, right?  It's a good release, right? 
[04:04:30]  She probably wore her clit away at this point.  Do you use any visual stimulation?  Do you have any magazines around or pictures?  No.  I don't want to buy that stuff because I don't know what the newspaper guy will think of me  if I pick it up.  Oh, God.  The newspaper.  The savage.  You're worried about the fucking savage at the newsstand worrying what the fuck.  Oh, my goodness.  In fact, I remember.  Let me tell you something.  I don't know.  I must look a little young for my age because I picked up a magazine once and the guy wanted  to see my ID and I got embarrassed and ran out. 
[04:05:00]  He wanted to make sure you weren't a retarded human.  He wanted to see where you lived so he could kill you.  Let me see ID.  You want a hustler?  Oh, no.  What is that?  There you go.  Take a hustler.  There's some cock in there.  She needs a guy.  She needs like a, you know, Us magazine.  But there's cock in there.  Don't we have inches laying around?  That's what I was just going to say.  We should get her inches.  Get one of Jimmy Norton's fag magazines.  Let me see.  What's that one?  This is pretty good.  Patty, look at this one.  There's two cocks in this one.  Turn to page, this is Sasha Gray, Tommy Gunn, and Scott Nails.  We all know their combo.  Yeah.  Turn to page 66. 
[04:05:30]  Turn to page 66, Patty, in your workbook.  You could hold the mic in your mouth if you need to.  I'll put the mic for you.  There you go.  There she goes.  Where'd you get the snazzy PalTalk shirt?  That's nice.  Oh, I got it from Happy Typing Girls Pajama Party last night.  Oh, you were at the pajama party.  That's right.  Yeah, I got one of the shirts.  You were the one that they made fun of.  Look at these two fellas.  They got fedora in them.  There's like a little story to this one. 
[04:06:00]  When these two guys are interrogating a girl, they're like old-fashioned pride.  Oh, my God.  Yes, they do.  Like the 40s, like Bogart.  Yeah.  What do you think of that, Patty?  The interrogator takes hold of a prisoner's garb and violently shakes the person around?  She's reading the words.  Read the text.  Yeah, she's reading the text.  What the fuck is that?  That line could have come from a report at Guantanamo.  Turn to page, what do you think?  If you and your lady are into role-playing seven pieces.  What about the giant penises?  Come on.  Turn to page, Patty. 
[04:06:30]  Describe what you're seeing.  There you go.  Turn the page.  Oh, turn that page.  She's singing into it.  Don't be embarrassed.  Look at how big that is.  Why are you embarrassed?  Kate was skulling with a bedpan.  She giggles like a...  Fucking dope.  This is disgusting.  What's disgusting?  You have so much guilt.  You have so much fucking Catholic guilt in you.  Look at it.  Hold on.  What is disgusting about that?  Yeah.  Oh, there's that one picture on the bottom of the page.  Oh, I can't do that.  It's a girl sucking on a guy's cock.  Yeah. 
[04:07:00]  This one.  This one.  Yuck.  What's describing?  She's in fucking junior high.  Describe it.  She's doing something and there's something coming out and it's ill.  Oh, the money shot.  Yuck.  A load of jizz.  It's a money shot.  That's what it is.  It's a money shot.  Patty, when you masturbate, what do you think of?  If you're not thinking of pictures like that.  I don't know.  A perfectly brewed cup of coffee.  Or plaque.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Or plaque.  Just jump to the plaque.  I don't know.  Fucking plaque.  I don't like the... 
[04:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Which one would you like to be in here?  But I...  One thing I noticed...  Patty, a voice.  Oh, that voice.  The guy in the pictures are losing their hard on voice.  I do notice with some of those girls, when they do that.  They just turn their heads in the pictures.  What the fuck was that?  What?  I'm trying to fuck a perfect hooker.  Can you shut that off?  I thought it affected their brains or something.  If they swallowed stuff.  So, I looked it up.  And about three quarters of those girls have high IQs. 
[04:08:00]  What?  Wait, wait.  Patty heard.  I think I heard her right.  That when a girl, like, swallows, it affects their brain.  It affected her brain like she wasn't bright anymore or something.  Why did you think that?  Where did you hear that?  I don't know.  Who told you that?  I have no idea.  I don't remember.  It just, like, stuck with things.  Not far from the truth.  It seems to be the dumb one, so...  No.  No.  Who told you that?  I don't know.  You heard that growing up?  The only thing was that when I hear them being interviewed, they sound like they don't 
[04:08:30]  know too much.  They don't read too much.  You know?  And you think that's...  It must be the jizz.  It must be the jizz.  And you made the leap that it has to be the jizz?  It has to be the gals of jizz.  It can't be the crystal meth 10 minutes before.  Yeah, no kidding.  Or the fucking...  I don't know.  But then I read some kind of statistics.  The fact that they were beating hot and drop.  Dropped out of school at 13 because they were being fucked at home by the teacher.  But then those girls are actually in the gifted category IQ-wise, so why would they be that?  Where did you find this info out? 
[04:09:00]  I don't know.  Some kind of a statistic.  Sex just for the emotional...  You're not a complete human being.  You have not done what human beings need to do to be complete humans.  Ah.  I know one thing.  The last time I went down to AC was back in June.  Ah.  Mm-hmm.  And the guy at the desk that was giving out the comp tickets wanted to, you know, once  wanted me to come down sometime and go for coffee with him.  Why didn't you go?  Why didn't you go? 
[04:09:30]  Did you like him?  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  I'm still in touch with him, so...  How are you in touch with him?  Not the fucking shy bit.  You fucked someone already.  You know, he's a nice guy.  What are you waiting for?  Well, I'm going to wait until the 27th, because I was invited to a free slot tournament.  You fucking guilt-ridden cyclops.  You don't have to pay or anything.  A what?  A free slot tournament.  If you win, you get a little money, you know?  You're never going to do it.  And they only give it to cardholders, and I have a card for the last four years, even  though I don't go very often, but I still get the information. 
[04:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Keep the card, though, you know?  It only takes a little room in your wallet.  How great would it be, though?  So what I'll do is if he's probably working that night, so I'll go down and have coffee with him.  Where's Richard Speck when you need him?  Fuck someone already.  You know, I'll have coffee with him.  Wouldn't that be great?  Start with a coffee is a good start, but you haven't had the coffee yet.  I'll have coffee with him.  He was a nice guy.  No, but I will.  I will.  I'll make it a point to go down and, you know, hang with him.  When you're 68?  Yes.  No, on the 27th of October, I'm going to go.  You've had 30 years of coffee.  You need your fucking penis.  You've had your whole fucking life to have coffee. 
[04:10:30]  You know, I just want to get to know him.  Start with coffee at 51.  You know, and he likes me, you know, a lot.  He doesn't.  How great would it be after the first cup of coffee if she's forced to eat his oniony  ass at gunpoint in an alley?  No, I really can tell.  You know, I'm just going to go down.  You've got to jump on it because you're going to show up on the 27th.  I'm ready for coffee.  And he's going to go, who the fuck are you?  I tossed aside an invitation six months ago and you show up now looking like that. 
[04:11:00]  Are you kidding me?  I'm looking at another girl rubbing his unclipped cock through his workman's overalls, his coveralls.  Oh, my God.  You can't paint and child's blood on them.  I'll go down there.  I'll do the slide.  Get down there now.  Now.  Every second that you're not blowing that guy is a fucking waste of your life.  That's what he does.  He's been to 50 of them already.  He's not going to fucking remember you like his princess walking in. 
[04:11:30]  He does remember me.  He's called me once or twice.  You have no time.  Look, at this point in your life, if you blow the thousand guys, you're still a loser.  You're behind schedule.  You're still way behind.  He has called me, you know, to chat with me on the phone and stuff.  Chat on the phone.  What, did he crank the handle?  Chat.  No one chats on the phone anymore.  Caldonia, 647.  Hello, Sarah.  Could you connect me to the guy that gives away the comp cards?  Right away, number please.  How the fuck old are you? 
[04:12:00]  Yeah, he knows I'm coming down on the 27th.  He knows on the 27th.  Good.  She's got it scheduled like a missile launch date.  You know, he just works the dust down there.  It's a fucking cup of coffee, you dolt.  You know, he takes his break, and we'll have a cup of coffee in one of the restaurants.  Excellent plan.  Wow, that's wonderful.  What an awful.  This guy thinks cup of coffee means what I think it means.  Right.  Which is meet me in my apartment and suck, or you get punched.  I hope it ends in fireworks or a shallow grave for all of us here.  All you see is one of those three-quarter leg pant legs just sticking out of the fucking 
[04:12:30]  dirt.  With a fucking shoe and a broken foot.  I'm kidding, of course.  I hope he gets through with you.  I hope he gets through with you, and your cock looks like it's covered with espresso grounds.  Yes, I tripped, Jim.  You said your cock, meaning her.  Her cock.  Oh, she probably got a cock.  Who knows?  Oh, she looked at me all mean.  Like, no, I don't have a cock.  What was that, Patty?  Do you have a cock?  Do you have a cock?  She doesn't know. 
[04:13:00]  She's never opened her pants.  You know I don't.  All right, Patty.  Oh, we have seen her completely naked, by the way.  Really?  She put on a Crusty the Clown mask.  Something with masks on the show.  We're like the Mardi Gras.  And she jerked me off wearing, she put on deli gloves and jerked me off.  Yeah, she put on deli gloves and jerked off Jimmy.  Is that true?  Oh, yeah.  Put on a clown mask and got completely naked and crawled through mousetraps to get checks  so she could pay her rent.  She's done a lot for us.  And I played with her nipples while she played with herself with a vibrator.  And we put a vibrator in our panties. 
[04:13:30]  All right.  Yeah, I know.  It makes no sense.  You know something?  But don't put a dick in there.  No, keep the cocks out.  She's also...  Jerk off Jimmy with deli gloves on the radio.  But still waiting for the nice, for the right guy.  Had her bare hand down the front of Ron Jeremy's pants.  Yeah.  Under his ball bag.  And let Ron Jeremy put his hand down the front of her pants.  You know her.  But she's a virgin.  But don't put the dick in the pussy.  Cup of coffee on the 27.  Cup of coffee on the 27.  And hopefully by 2009 we'll be up to him combing my hair. 
[04:14:00]  But I'll bet he's hearing this and why would he want to go out with a girl that's done those things?  Yeah, you slut.  Because she's famous.  She's on her own AIDS.  Great show.  But he probably thinks you're a nice girl and now he knows that you're playing with Ron's balls  and you're jerking off and you're like your nipples played with.  You're a vibrator whore.  All right, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Good luck, Patty.  We got enough comedy out of you.  We're done with you now.  It was nice meeting you.  You seem very happy.  You seem like a well-balanced, settled person.  Thank you.  All this deflects off you because you have an inner happiness. 
[04:14:30]  Yes.  But still you should let some guy fuck you in the pussy.  Yeah.  Or at least, and I don't mean to be crass, but let some black man use your mouth as a pocket pussy.  Go with God.  Let someone fuck you, you idiot.  All right.  It is time for the line of the day.  God damn, Louis fits right in.  Absolutely.  Louis.  It's not even an effort.  It's just something about this room is horrible.  It is.  It really is.  It really is.  Because we leave, you know, Billy Burr.  Sure. 
[04:15:00]  Bill Burr.  There are so many times he'll sit right there and we'll just go through a show and the same  shit's happening today.  And then we get out on the street and walk to our cars and he'll do nothing but go,  God, it's just so fucking terrible.  I know.  Poor fucking girl and the thing.  And then we're just fucking saying shit to her.  And I'm like, Billy, shut the fuck up.  I got to do that every day.  Right.  You know, and I got to sleep at night.  Don't make us think too much.  Don't fucking guilt me out because you can't fucking deal with it.  Yeah, go home, curl up in the fetal position and you shower.  Take your rape shower. 
[04:15:30]  Leave me out.  No, take it.  Take your rape shower.  Here's a rape kit.  Swab your pussy.  Give it to the police and go home.  Go get some coffee.  Sit in the tub until the water is all frigid and cold.  Oh, my God.  Cry yourself to sleep, faggot.  All right.  Oh, man.  Line of the Day, sponsored by BodogFight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S.  in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on BodogFight.com, a mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any  seen before. 
[04:16:00]  I personally don't even know how one was picked today.  It was tough.  Because they were flying all over the place.  Well, there were some great lines at the end of the show, but I think the competition  ended before 11, so just keep that in mind.  What a rip-off.  Because they had to get it together.  Don't count any lines out.  Oh, okay.  Don't count any lines out.  You know something?  Because Otto had one.  It was very fucking funny.  I don't know.  Let's see what the judges said.  Well, we got two.  Very competitive here.  How do you just get to who judges this?  Yeah.  Who's behind the scenes?  There are morons. 
[04:16:30]  Here we have moron al fresco and moron under glass is over here, but they judge it.  Shut up.  Don't fucking use ventriloquism back there to call me an asshole without moving your lips.  We got three runner-ups today.  Wow.  Three runner-ups today.  Wow.  That means it was a pretty damn good show.  Here's the first runner-up for line of the day.  I always don't measure, like, I think you can measure how bad a person you are by how soon  you masturbated after the plane's hit.  Like, what's the first time? 
[04:17:00]  Like a month after?  That's a good gauge.  Between the two buildings collapsing, which is probably a bad sign that I had to.  I had to, because otherwise they win, you know, the terrorists.  Right.  Wow.  There you go.  There you go.  Runner-up.  That was a great show.  I'm honored.  Made the runner-up.  We see Kay with the runner-up.  Let's do the second runner-up for line of the day.  It's one of those things, like, they don't usually just have him laying around.  Well, he was probably going in there to fix a toilet.  There was a toilet full of diarrhea and shit and tampons that he was fixing. 
[04:17:30]  Oh, so you think he, the maintenance guy, they found, yeah, they said, hey, let's use  what he's using.  Well, they just saw the retarded man walking to the bathroom with the snake, and the one  guy went, are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Oh, my God.  That was awesome.  That was awesome.  And the one guy said, yeah, and then he goes, as he's holding the guy down, putting  it in his ass, the other guy's like, I just thought he wanted to turn the lights off  and run.  I think they were going to rape another man mentally disabled. 
[04:18:00]  You know what line of the day is like?  It's like those old sitcoms that plays the still picture during the episode.  You know, you'll have the Fonz doing a little pose by the car or something.  Very good, Jimmy.  All right, the final runner-up line of the day.  Here it is.  Oh, my God.  What would you like to be in here?  But one thing I noticed.  Out of your voice.  Oh, that voice.  The guy in the pictures are losing their heart on the voice.  I do notice. 
[04:18:30]  Yeah, that's a good one.  That was last minute.  Another one from Jimmy.  Finally, here is today's line of the day.  Here, Jimmy's vocal.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  When your husband goes food shopping and puts the groceries away, does he have to hire 
[04:19:00]  a rodeo clown to distract you?  Otto.  Otto and George with line of the day.  Yeah.  That one was killer, man.  Thank you.  Otto will be at Comics tonight.  Yes.  On 14th Street.  And in Freehold tomorrow.  And go to OttoandGeorge.com if you have a computer.  There you go.  And Otto's working with Nina Hartley.  She's got a book out called Total Sex, and she's doing a border signing on Wall Street 
[04:19:30]  today at Borders.  If you want to meet her, she's a porn legend.  Yeah.  You know, if you want to meet her, she's there this afternoon.  She's there.  And of course, Louie.  Tomorrow night, a great stand-up, obviously.  Saturday night.  Saturday night.  I'm sorry.  Trump Marina.  Trump Marina.  Oh, yeah.  Otto's tomorrow, Friday.  I'm sorry.  And Louie's Saturday.  Saturday.  I'm also doing a taping.  Yeah, we're so used to being a Friday with this.  Tonight is Comics tonight.  Oh, is it?  Oh, it is.  Okay.  Tonight is Comics.  Tomorrow, Freehold Sheridan.  Okay, yes.  And you're taping something? 
[04:20:00]  Oh, well, I'm doing an HBO hour for the first time.  It's taping in L.A. at the Henry Fonda Theater.  All right.  You guys aren't there, but somewhere.  It's awesome.  For XM, you are, so.  Yeah, yeah.  Anyway.  Some people show up.  November 4th.  I want to look at the loons.  Dope.  You get lost.  Louie, it was a pleasure.  Louie.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks for having me.  Amazing, man.  Great day.  I had a great time.  Louie's first appearance in the studio.  He just killed.  That's my favorite radio time ever I ever had.  It was great.  Come back and see us.  It fits in all too well.  And I have a couple of plugs. 
[04:20:30]  One is that my New Year's Eve Borgata tickets go on sale.  I'm going.  I know you are.  You have to call and get you a room immediately.  Kenny's getting them.  Okay.  Kenny better be on it.  He's on it.  He's nice with the smoothies and the fruit, but if I fucking end up holding my dick in  front of the hotel there, I'm going to be pissed.  Yes.  That is Saturday, 10 a.m. on Ticketmaster.  They go on sale for the Borgata.  It's not the big room that I did with David Tell, the event center.  This is the music box.  Oh, it's an intimate atmosphere.  Well, I know it's a good room, but there's going to be less tickets than there were last 
[04:21:00]  time.  So, if you want to go, and the Hammerstein, the 10th of November.  I'm also joining Jimmy in Denver.  Yeah.  And they're going to the same place next week.  Just going to hang out.  A couple of men in Denver.  We'll see Jimmy Monday, San Francisco.  Yeah, man.  You guys had that guy.  Fucking job.  I'm going to watch it on the flight.  If I can get my copy before we leave, I want to watch it on the flight.  Well, if you're up, call us tomorrow to talk about it, because I'm seeing the movie tonight  as well, The Bridge.  I will be up.  I'm doing the radio out there.  Yeah.  All right.  Give us a call tomorrow morning, Jimmy.  All right.  All right. 
[04:21:30]  Wow.  What can I say?  We had a great time.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Later, man.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no, I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cup right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak. 
[04:22:00]  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the PF thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite floral treat.  My favorite eating cock.
