<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a furious rant about the eighteen-minute commercial break preceding the broadcast.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, repeatedly stressed the absurdity of the length, and callers overwhelmingly agreed, with one, Dave, even jokingly requesting another.  This led to a discussion of Opie's recent resignation as Assistant Program Director, fueled by his frustration with Jeremy Coleman and Ken Stevens over their lack of communication and disregard for his and Anthony's input. They announced they would continue the show but disavowed any responsibility for the station’s success or failure, threatening to start late if the excessive commercials persisted.

The show veered into numerous tangents.  The "55-gallon drum challenge" was discussed, along with a past PSA incident that angered a special interest group and a critical review of the Grammy Awards. Plans were made for a post-show Hooters gathering with listeners, including a contest winner.  Further complaints were aired regarding the lack of communication from management, highlighting Jeremy's failure to even speak to them in person.  Interspersed were random listener calls, including one recounting a family drama, a bowling discussion, and an anecdote about a listener shot with lamb blood, with the hosts playing a sound clip of this incident. Fast Freddy called in, providing a website address for photos from a previous segment.

The chaos continued with a segment focused on Earl, a show employee, and his attempt to invite Nadine, a departing co-worker, to Eddie Trunk's wedding.  The conversation initially touched upon a past altercation between Black Earl and Al Dukes from the Ron and Fez show before focusing on Earl's awkward invitation to Nadine.  Earl initially denied inappropriate behavior at Nadine's going-away party but later admitted to asking her to the wedding. Nadine’s response—requiring her boyfriend's attendance—caused considerable amusement and frustration, leading to an escalating situation culminating in Earl's destructive outburst involving a microphone. Eddie Trunk called in to explain the RSVP limitations, and Nadine joined, confirming the invitation and expressing discomfort with Earl's approach.

Leif Garrett, known for his VH1 "Behind the Music" episode, joined the show, sparking a discussion of his past struggles with drug abuse and career anecdotes, including working with Eric Estrada and a foosball movie. Mario Cantone called in to share his Grammy and celebrity culture opinions.  A suggestive phone call concluded this segment, with Leif Garrett still in studio.  The hosts consistently used vulgar and offensive language throughout.

A phone interview with Mark Burnett, executive producer of *Survivor*, followed, focusing on *Survivor 25*, its cannibalistic island location, and the contestants, specifically a very attractive female contestant ("Cleopatra").  The hosts made frequent jokes about large breasts and past antics, including the lamb blood incident. Leif Garrett remained in-studio, discussing his career and comparing himself to Vanilla Ice.  Rudy, a recurring caller known for provocative and homophobic remarks, also participated. Stephanie, the "Naughty Nighty Contest" winner, joined, along with Patty, a 46-year-old virgin with a gimpy leg.  Jennifer called in to plan a goldfish-related "55-gallon drum challenge" entry.

A final segment featured Jennifer, in-studio with Opie, Anthony, and Rick, in a bizarre game involving the revelation of a “not pretty” aspect of her body, which turned out to be related to her weight.  Following commentary on her physique, Jennifer was challenged to a game involving secreting live goldfish in her clothing, qualifying her for a future "55-gallon drum challenge."  The show concluded with discussions of their upcoming Hooters trip with Stephanie and Scott Pharrell, and several messages from the "FU line."

[00:06:30]  wanting to know  if there was any more room  for the challenge  uh... the 55 gallon drum challenge  yes  yes  there is  yes i think we're gonna give away  uh... three more spots  three okay  uh... what do you want to do  to get into the 55 gallon drum challenge  i was thinking about eating worms  worms  is that possible  you'd have to eat a lot of worms  a lot  yeah we've seen the worm thing  it's pretty impressive  but  it gets nice and bloody and dirty in your mouth  but compared to uh...  some of the stuff we've had here recently  i don't know if eating worms is good enough 
[00:07:00]  you know  we had the girl spooning out big  lumps of lamb brain  right out of the lamb skull  and then yesterday we had  nuked blood  until it was the consistency of  pudding skin  yeah  and the girl shoved that down her throat  anyway  it was the same color as uh...  chocolate pudding skin  yeah you're getting sick aren't you  that's awful  it was an  it was disgusting  we got some video up on  foundrymusic.com  check it out by the way  and then we had the uh...  girl that we doused in lamb blood  right  with uh... super soakers  that was so much fun  all right 
[00:07:30]  well can we put you on standby heather  sure  we got to kind of you know  uh... figure it out  see if it's if it's worthy or not  okay  all right  all right  well uh... anthony i have an announcement to make  yes  i'm uh... i'm resigning  yes  from what  as uh... assistant pd  oh... of the new york station  now i remember when we uh... re-signed  you had put in the contract  and you really did  that you were the assistant program director 
[00:08:00]  of uh... the station here in new york  no joke  it's official  oh... oh yeah  i am the assistant pd  here at uh... wnew new york  and uh... anthony  i mean he didn't  your assistant to the assistant manager  anthony uh... anthony didn't get the title  because he didn't really care like i did  i really cared  i mean all kidding aside  it was something that was important to me  that was your mistake  uh...  the caring part  right  and uh... i just want to make it official  that i am uh... resigning my position  i i don't want any say in the success 
[00:08:30]  or failure of this radio station in new york city  see basically i don't want to be responsible  for what is going on anymore  the only time  because what happened was  let me let me just finish my thought  when we re-signed in june  uh... you know i took i took pride in the fact  that we were staying with the company  and we're quite happy that we are staying with the company  okay  of course  uh... i wanted to be assistant program director  so i could uh... have a say in what goes on  what shows are around us  uh... what direction the station's going in  uh... and uh... that role kind of expanded 
[00:09:00]  uh... to uh... other cities let's just say  okay  i am completely  insulted and disgusted  with jeremy coleman and ken stevens  there are changes that are going to happen  that they have decided not to tell uh... myself  and anthony  yeah  and i think that's complete bs  we're always told about being team players  team players  well we're not uh... alerted to certain things 
[00:09:30]  our uh... opinions  and uh... recommendations  for this uh... crap hole here  in uh... in new york  uh...  no one really pays attention to uh...  uh... to to what we said  ah it's a goofy  a couple of goofy radio guys  all right sure  but you know something  i think uh... we kind of got a line on  on what should happen here  yeah  and we gave a lot of suggestions  we gave our opinions  and um... uh... you know  no one 
[00:10:00]  no one  they didn't listen to us  when it comes right down to it anthony  no because uh... actually thinking it out  and reasoning and doing the best thing for the station  takes uh... back seat  to uh... things like  i don't know  i don't know  uh... uh... bullying  muscling  deals  things that uh... really aren't for the good of uh...  of uh... the stations  or the company  but  you know  you make a promise here and there  hell  to get off the hook over there  and then uh... before you know it 
[00:10:30]  um...  you're uh... you're effing up stations all over the place  hell that  you know they're bosses  they have every right to  to do what they uh... think needs  to be done  whatever  i won't even argue that point  but i'm insulted that uh... you know  no one gave us a phone call today  to tell us about uh...  changes that will be happening in the very near future  okay so  uh... you know  i i washed my hands of uh... programming  here in new york  anthony and i will still kick ass  and still do our fine radio show  we care about this show  period 
[00:11:00]  but at this point at 313  on thursday  the last day of february  everyone else is on their effing own  there you go  we separate ourselves from  every single effing person here  that's it  well ron and fez are still fun  we like those guys  we like ron and fez  i'm just saying you know  but we take no responsibility for anything  no responsibility for the success  or failure of the station in new york  yeah 
[00:11:30]  if it succeeds great  you can tell me to my face  that i was completely wrong  and ant was completely wrong  great  i look forward to that day  yeah  but i can't sit here anymore  and act like uh...  all this crap makes sense  it doesn't  and as far as radio 101 goes  take care of the 18 minutes of commercials  before we start a goddamn radio show  at three o'clock  no one sits through 18 minutes of commercials  no one  do your effing 
[00:12:00]  hey hey  hey watch the language  that ain't gonna get through  so that's that  good luck to everybody  good luck  may the best man win  yeah  have fun  and this all comes down to  not even having the 
[00:12:30]  the common courtesy  to give a phone call  today  today  give a reach around  or jeremy  your office was right next to us  you didn't even come in  did you  did you  uh-uh  guys i know this is gonna upset you  and ken wants to talk to you about it  and see if we can work something out  nothing  nothing  there will be no talking  that's the respect you showed me and anthony today  there's no need for meetings  there's no need for us to sit in rooms with anybody and discuss things 
[00:13:00]  like has been presented  there's no need for it  we know what we do  we do our show  three to seven  that's it  anything else  good luck to you  and starting tomorrow  we're not going on the air at three  if there's 18 minutes of commercials before our show  yeah  now maybe we'll come on and burp  and fart for 18 straight minutes  maybe we'll do something stupid like that  but  but we're not going to start our radio show  take care of the problem jeremy  remember when we were squeezing commercials at the end of our show 
[00:13:30]  because we had no choice  and we listened to you  we're like okay  we'll  we'll take care of the problem  yeah  take care of the problem  don't ask me my advice  no that's done  that's done  I'll be busy working on the opian anthony show with anthony  that's it  no more  not even an effing phone call  no more  and I'm so glad we said what we did 
[00:14:00]  at the meeting the other day  thank god  oh yeah  thank god  fast freddy  what's up guys  hey  hey uh  I wasn't going to bring this up  I've got all those pictures by the way  but I wasn't going to bring this up  but you sound pretty pissed today  who is that guy that came storming in yesterday  and said  this time they got too effing far  oh uh  oh that was hysterical  oh the PSA thing  uh yeah  oh yeah yeah yeah 
[00:14:30]  that guy stormed in and said  this time is  that's not even effing funny  yeah Ken got a little uh  oh that was Ken  yeah  and he turned around and split  it was hysterical  yeah if you're a special interest group  and you have  what a tool  and you have a problem with something  and I have done on this show  all you have to do is write Ken or Jeremy  and they will put a 60 second PSA on the air  during our commercials  even though we did nothing wrong  nothing  nothing  well I got something good for you 
[00:15:00]  I remember the conversation we had with the Sikhs  and all the stuff that happened after 9-11  we did nothing wrong that  that means a PSA in the middle of our freaking show  and not just one  every break  I heard that it was awful  every break  but we were talking something about  I'm sure it said something like  towelhead terrorists or something like that  no what happened was  you know a lot of people were upset after the 9-11  because a lot of people died  really  so they lashed out  and one guy said  you know let's kill all the 
[00:15:30]  you know all the towelheads or whatever  and then we had a Sikh call in  and he goes  look man you know we wear the turbans  but we're nice guys  and we really aren't part of this  blah blah blah  we had an open discussion about it  and we understood this kid's point  yeah  big time  okay  and then we calmed everyone down  but I'm sorry we're all a little edgy here in New York  and so what happens  a special interest group  that probably didn't even hear the whole goddamn segment  gets to Ken and Jeremy  next thing you know  we're playing a freaking 49 second PSA 
[00:16:00]  I think you were still playing when you stormed in  not anymore  wait wait wait wait wait  I wanted to play with the circus music  hey man you guys are having too much fun  you want to call back with the pictures  yeah you do that  I'll call back later  alright man  take it easy  there goes Fast Freddy  I wanted to play it with the circus music  oh there it goes  I guess it's never getting played again  that's  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[00:16:30]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  see a new PSA  don't worry Ben  he's not  protecting his head  his card's flying  another reason I'm not going to be involved with programming  because they never even told us or asked us  you know  look dude  you know  we really need to do this PSA  because they're really upset  and  I know you guys are going to be pissed  but let's talk this out  and see if we can work out a solution  maybe you play it a few times  and  and then we'll drop it 
[00:17:00]  yeah  all of a sudden it just appears on our show  things are going to be different around here  starting today  today  18  today  there you go  all right  ready  3  2  1  OVNA  the Robert Downey Jr. is a radio  right  where you can't leave anything alone  let's hear a mother-daughter queef over the phone 
[00:17:30]  you pick artistic subjects  Opie and Anthony  yeah check it out the Opie and Anthony show  aren't we going out  aren't we going out tonight  we're going out  we're going out right after the show  yeah  maybe sooner  I think it's the first time we've been out 
[00:18:00]  since  9-11  not counting the benefits  and things that we were kind of a part of  Anthony  going to have a beer with the listeners  right at Hooter  right at 7 o'clock  downstairs  56th Street  between 7th and Broadway  Scott Farrell  from The Morning Show  he said he'll stop by  and drink with us  and Stephanie  who won the  Naughty Nighty Contest  she's on her way up 
[00:18:30]  from Washington  and she's going to hang with us  you guys get to meet Stephanie  the winner of the Naughty Nighty Contest  tonight at Hooters  it's kind of a hang  you guys know the deal  it's not  it's not like a road show or anything  we're just going to kind of hang  yes  we'll have some fun though  maybe if you guys work together  stop suggesting working together 
[00:19:00]  it ain't gonna happen  stop suggesting meetings  stop stop stop stop stop  if you had confidence in your show  you would just do your effing show  why do we have to work together  and meet and stuff  just do your effing show  because that's what we're doing  that's it  I don't understand why they won't meet  with me  why  not even a meeting  why  I don't really get it  I figure

[00:31:00]  but to  kind of  you know  try to  tell the  listeners  that everyone  is  chummy  chummy  and we  all go  out  and drink  and eat  party  together  it's just  ridiculous  what purpose  is that  going to  serve  it's not  that way  it's just  not that  way  it makes  for very  boring  homogenized  radio  boring  boring  boring  look at  Bobby from  Queens  more uncomfortable  than Rick's  attempt at  humor  wow

[01:02:00]  do that one  Earl just  threw something  at Ben  for laughing  Earl  why are you  getting mad at  Ben  why did you  throw something  at Ben  he was in  the way  wait  you're throwing  at me  no  this is the  wrong day  my friend  Earl  any other  day  it would  be a lot  of fun  Earl  anything  was asked  I wasn't  there  well obviously  that got a  reaction  because you're  throwing stuff  at Ben  as he  giggles  he's just  sitting there  cackling  like a  god damn  chicken  why do you  why do you  get so pissed 
[01:02:30]  off when Ben  cackles  why  he's enjoying  himself and  having good  clean fun  yeah  Ben's enjoying  the show  just a white  man laughing  right  what do you  think Earl  what's wrong  with you  what's wrong  do you have  a problem  with Ben  when he  cackles  can I  go now  no  no  we need  you  I don't  know  that's why  I'm asking  I'll give you  a couple more  little hands  lock the door  anything  you can

[01:03:30]  think  did you  ask her  a question  did you  ask  her  a question  if  she could  do something  for you  yeah  anything  Earl  comment  please  well I always  knowing that  what the reaction  will get from  I always say  I always use  the opie question  where that  when she goes  can we see  your stuff  oh you asked  her that  what  that isn't  what we're  talking about  but you asked  her to see 
[01:04:00]  but I know  what type  of reaction  I'll get  from it  that's why  I have  no idea  oh my god  oh my god  he's lost  his mind  oh my god  Earl has lost  his mind  wait a minute  Earl get back  hold on Earl  holy Jesus  Jesus Christ  Earl  what's wrong  holy Jesus  Earl lost  his mind  he wanted  to kill  Ben  what's wrong  Ben's laughing  too hard 
[01:04:30]  he's having  much too  good a time  okay Earl  so you asked  to see her stuff  I have no idea  where this is going  did you ask  Nadine  to maybe  attend something  with you  what  we're going  to Eddie  Trunk's wedding  ah  here's the rub  Eddie Trunk  that does  a couple  rock and roll  shows here  at WNW  on the weekend  yes  very good ones  and they did  a very good job  and he's getting  married  and you need  a date  so you  she wanted 
[01:05:00]  to go  I didn't  have a ride  so I asked  so you figure  you'd ask  the lovely  Nadine  to go with you  nothing's going  on  Earl  did you ask  Nadine  to go to  Eddie Trunk's  wedding  yes  you did  that's a date  a wedding  to go  to a wedding  with somebody  is kind of  like a night  out together  which is a date  so  but there's  more to it  I know  there's more  to it  and this  is the most  funnest  part of  this whole  story 
[01:05:30]  no she said  she said  you asked  her  hold it  you walked up  I did not  ask her  how did you  ask her  to go to  the wedding  with you  give me  your line  what was it  she knows  Eddie  I know  Eddie  I said  do you want  to go to  the wedding  you got  invited  to Eddie  Trunk's  wedding  Nadine did  not  as far as  I know  right  so you  went up  to Nadine  and said  Nadine  would you  go to  the wedding  with me  Eddie  Trunk's  wedding  with me  yes  and there  was a 
[01:06:00]  but  a but  on whose  part  yours  or hers  no I know  that's what  we're getting  to but at  first you  walked up  to Nadine  pretty Nadine  and said  would you  go to  Eddie  Trunk's  wedding  with me  there was  nothing  into this  it was  provided that  Earl I ain't  even gonna  go there  I ain't even  gonna go there  you're right  but you went  up to her  like anyone  would go up  to anyone  and asked  to go to  a wedding  what was  her answer  she said  she can go  provided that  she can bring  her boyfriend  with me  what's so funny  about that  there's nothing 
[01:06:30]  going on  you got  shut down  no  there's nothing  to shoot down  when you go  up to a girl  and ask her  to go to  someone's wedding  that's like  asking someone  on a date  and then  okay  I'll take  my boyfriend  let's say  you're in high  school  and you want  to ask  someone to  the prom  they never  shoot back  an answer  to you  like well  yeah  but can  I bring  my boyfriend  oh my god 
[01:07:00]  put that down  Earl  oh no  here is what  happened  in essence  Earl  if you really  think about it  no no  do we have  witnesses  in that  she has to  bring her boyfriend  right  that annoyed  you  doesn't it  oh no  Eddie  we're free  with Eddie  Earl  I had no  problem  with it  yes you had  no problem  but here's  what happened  you in essence  sent Nadine  an invitation  to Eddie's 
[01:07:30]  wedding  plus one  you gave  her  an invitation  to the wedding  he's not  going  who's not  going  Nadine's  boyfriend  is not  even  going  why is  that  first of  Eddie  is a  true  that you  also  called  Eddie  and said  that I'm  bringing  two dates  I didn't say  bringing  two dates  I went  Eddie  asked  let me  go  let me  backtrack  this whole  thing  I was  not  going  to the  wedding  at all  because I  did not  have a ride 
[01:08:00]  to the  wedding  I said  I do  not  have a  ride  it was  Eddie's  suggestion  if you can  get someone  to go  with you  that has  a ride  there was  a couple  other people  here from  the station  that are  going  dude  Earl I  love you  you know  that's great  but let me  tell you  hold on  maybe it was  your whole  hold on  maybe it was  your approach  because if  you should have  went hey  there was  nothing  hey Nadine  are you going  to Eddie  Trunk's  wedding  you are  great  can I  get a ride  there's nothing  about the  approach  at all 
[01:08:30]  Nadine and  the boyfriend  didn't ask  you to put  on chauffeur  uniform for  that night  too  did they  no  there's  nothing  to do  with it  Nadine  you're the best  friend I  ever had  I'm just  trying to drive  you to the  wedding  Wiggly first  yes  Miss Nadine  Nadine's in  the studio  Nadine how  are you  we called  you a piece  of ass  because I  thought you  weren't  we didn't  think you  were here  anymore  so please  don't file  any sexual  harassment  charges against  us  so did  Earl ask  you to  Eddie  Trunk's  wedding  yes he  did  he did 
[01:09:00]  so what's  wrong with  that  there is  nothing  wrong  with that  I didn't  think there  was anything  wrong with  that  oh Earl  there's  nothing wrong  with it  there's  nothing wrong  with asking  a girl  to a  to a  prom  right  we are both  friends with  Eddie  we are  how uncomfortable  was it  it was obviously  uncomfortable  because see how  he's reacting  Earl you know  how uncomfortable  was it Earl  when Nadine  had to tell you  that can I  bring my  boyfriend  Earl you know  what you gotta  do you gotta aim  a little lower  than Nadine  though maybe  ask the El  Salvadorian 
[01:09:30]  cleaning lady  that comes in  that's true man  she'd suck it  for a sandwich  there's nothing  Norton  knows by  experience  no Earl  Earl it's  okay so  you asked  her and  what did  you actually  say Nadine  exactly what  Earl just  said I  don't know  why I said  that because  I think  that's really  wrong  that's rude  don't you  think you  probably said  the rudest  god damn  thing  that is so  rude of me  why would  you say  that  I was not  going to  try to  go through  that  there was  nothing  going on  that is  shot down 
[01:10:00]  I don't  know why  I said  that  yeah that's  rude  I know  why  because  you got  scared  you're  like oh  my god  I think  he's asking  me out  on a date  and I'm  uncomfortable  here  yeah  and I do  have a  boyfriend  so I'm  just going  to tell  him  because  you see  the way  he looks  at you  when he  talks to  you  it's not  he's a  good guy  there was  nothing to him  because we  both know  Eddie  and we're  going to  and he's  getting married  I know  Eddie  too  you had to  call  Eddie  and say  that you're  bringing  two people  to his  wedding  yeah that's  now let me  know what  happened  you call  up Eddie  Trunk  and you  I called  Ed and I  said  because he  needed  at the  RSVP 
[01:10:30]  by Monday  I call  him on  I think  it was  Sunday  or Monday  and I  said  I can't  go  but  I might  have a  ride  but  there's  a  problem  she might  have to  bring  another  person  yeah  and then  what happened  he called  me back  and said  we're  overloaded  and he  called me  back  oh and  then he  shoots  the whole  thing  down  isn't that  embarrassing  like I  don't need  another  oh this  whole thing  is so  awkwardly  I don't 
[01:11:00]  sense  the  awkwardness  in it  I told my  boyfriend  that I  had done  this  and he  was so  mad at  me  he's  like  that is  so rude  how can  you  even  say  that  good for  the  boyfriend  I'm  not  going  first of  all I  wasn't  invited  you  weren't  invited  and I  don't  you  should  go  Nadine  man  you've  got  sunset  of  rest  Earl I'll  take it  I'll  drink  this  is  going  to  be  I'm  not  going  Earl I  got a  song for  you  and  Nadine  who is 
[01:11:30]  this  oh  Jesus  hang on  Earl  don't go  crazy  Earl  hang out  Earl  oh my  god  Earl's  going to  punch  somebody  Rick  is  in  front  of  the  door  and  he's  not  letting  Earl  out  of  the  studio  Earl  it's  okay  hang out  hang out  hang out  hang out  now the  mic broke  you broke  no stop  don't 
[01:12:00]  hey Pete  Johnson's  going to  yell at  you  hang out  Earl  we'll keep  it  track  today  we need  a new  PSA  we need  a new  megaphone  and now  we need  a new  microphone  is  he  pissed  Earl  there  that  mic  is  fixed  look  cause I  feel  so  secure  when we're  together  everybody  lighters  yeah  every rocker  has a soft  side  yeah  oh this is  awful  alright you know 
[01:12:30]  oh look  look who's on  the phone  maybe he can  shed some  light on  alright let's  go to  Eddie  Trunk  the groom  Eddie  Trunk  what's up  boys  how you  doing Ed  congrats on  your wedding  by the way  thanks  I'm down  in Florida  actually  and I just  got a  call from  Johnny Hardrock  telling me  that I should  call in  and then Rick  called me  and I  just heard a  little bit of  what's going  on on hold  well here's  what happened  as we  understand it  Earl  was invited  to your  wedding  he could  bring a  guest  he asked  Nadine  because Nadine  lives  they live 
[01:13:00]  close together  and she  has a car  so that's  Earl's  right  I'm not  even disputing  that  everyone else  is implying  that  Nadine  she's even  applying  that it  was something  more  nothing else  you don't  think  zero  well anyway  then Nadine  decides that  she says  okay I'll  go but I  I want to  bring my  boyfriend  to which  instead of  Earl going  are you  out of  your mind  for even  suggesting  that  he goes  let me  call up  Eddie  well here's  what I  know  okay  first let me 
[01:13:30]  preface this  by saying  you know  anybody who's  had a  wedding knows  that it's  pretty difficult  to try to  get everything  in line  and meet  certain  criteria  for head  count  etc  right  everyone knows  it's always  there's too  many people  and  Jim  Norden  I'm sorry  go ahead  continue  Eddie  well what  happens is  you hit a  certain number  and then it  goes over  and then under  and just all  this wackiness  so that being  said I would  have loved to  have been able  to invite  everybody that 
[01:14:00]  I work with  at WNEW  but it just  simply wasn't  possible  alright whatever  that's fine  I invited  Earl  and a guest  and I got  a phone call  down here in  Florida a couple  days ago  I reminded  Earl that  the RSVP  date was  this past  Monday  right  and I didn't  hear anything  from him  and I said  what are you  doing  and then he  called me  back and he  said listen  I don't have  a ride  and I said  well you know  if you're really  that hard up  for a ride  there is a  train that goes  right to where  the church is  if that works  for you  if you can't  make it  don't worry  about it  and he 
[01:14:30]  called me  back  and then he  said well  he said  I can bring  Nadine  but the only  way I can  do that  is she gets  to bring  her boyfriend  as well  so can you  give me  a plus two  a plus two  like it's  one of the  heavy metal  shows  that Eddie's  you got  balls  it's the  poison show  I need  plus two  if that's  not a problem  I will not  go  maybe  Nadine's  boyfriend  will pass  out  he drinks  too much  and then Earl  has got  even  it's in  maybe the  boyfriend  drives  no no 
[01:15:00]  Earl  wait  no  no  stop  oh my god  he's smashing  the mic  that's like a  that's a very  expensive microphone  watch the Judas Priest  CDs  Earl you're scaring  Leif Garrett  Leif Garrett is  petrified outside  the studio  hey Eddie  is Piazza  going to the  wedding  I'm here  he's in spring  training  so he's  obviously not  going to be  able to be  there  I was hoping  I'd get to  sit at this  table  Earl  look at that  microphone  now  Earl  let him  let him  go  what do  you want  on that  mic  let Earl 
[01:15:30]  go  don't hit  don't hit  Leif Garrett  on the way  out  can I say  something  he's a teen  idol  he's a teen  idol  yeah  don't finish  to Earl  honestly  I know  that he  had no  other agenda  in asking  me that  he just  knows  that I  love  Eddie  Trunk  he asked  me to  go  because  he thought  I would  like it  I think  I'm the  one who  created  this whole  mess  yes you  did  you're  a dirty  girl  of me  to ask  that  I didn't  even think  I would  get away  with it  but he  said he  would ask  so I  was like  okay  but I  even knew  that my 
[01:16:00]  boyfriend  was going  to say  no  I  totally  knew  that  and that  was cool  I don't  know why  I just  asked it  I guess  because I  could  what I  had told  Earl  was  that I  would give  me a  couple  days  because  we  still  had  some  last  minute  RSVPs  coming  and if  there  were  some  people  that  couldn't  make  it  and a  spot  opened  up  I'd  be  happy  to  say  yeah  no  problem  because  it  wouldn't  have  been  a  problem  but  then  I  found  out  that  we're  like  exactly  on  our  number  and there  was  no way  that  it  would  work  without  setting  us  into  a  different  area  of  money  just 
[01:16:30]  to be  put  in that  position  is  just  horrid  like  I  invited  him  and a  guest  and he  wants  to  bring  two  people  here's  the  thing  here's  what  I  found  Nadine  you  don't  ask  a  girl  with  a  boyfriend  to  a  wedding  because  she's  going  to  want  to  bring  him  I  would  never  say  that  at  all  but  the  only  thing  is  that  I  only  see  him  once  a  week  so  I  figured  he was  going  to be  at  my  house  anyway  hold on 
[01:17:00]  Pete Johnson  is in the  studio  now  Pete  did you  see  what  Earl  did  to the  mic  nobody  white  did  that  Pete  did  you  see  that  can  you  believe  that  I  don't  know  what  you  guys  do  to  him  he  he  took  the  mic  and  he  slammed  it  onto  the  top  of  the  counter  so  I  don't  even  know  if  the  mic  works  anymore  never mind  the wire  ripped right  out of  it  Rick  you're  putting  it  back  together  Pete  was  on  that  microphone  let  Pete  fix  the  mic  it's 
[01:17:30]  my  job  I  can  do  it  Pete  not  happy  this  studio  is  his  baby  yeah  I  thought  Opie  did  something  all right  check that  mic  is it  going to  work  we got  Leif  Garrett  outside  he's  got to  use  that  mic  does  it  work  hello  Pete  you're  a genius  thank you  you fixed  it again  where's  Earl  I gotta  talk  to  him  you gotta  fix  Earl  now  I think  a lobotomy  might  do it  alright 
[01:18:00]  wow  Earl  lost  his  friggin  mind  how did  this  even  come  up  on  where  did  this  even  come  from  was  it  Nadine  had a  little  going away  thing  last night  and Earl  decided to  ask her  at the  going away  thing  actually  no  that's  not  true  he didn't  ask me  yesterday  I  kind of  slipped  and said  that  because  I had  too much  to drink  and I  didn't  realize  having  Ben  Stinky  and everybody  else  there  they made  a field  day out  of that  yeah  Ben  called me 
[01:18:30]  he couldn't  even talk  he was laughing  so hard  he gets  Earl  so pissed  Earl's  ulcer  right now  looks like  the girl  we shot  the blood  at  yesterday  good for  the boyfriend  for saying  no  you gotta  respect  that guy  he's like  no way  that guy  he must have  a big  yule  because he's  willing to  let her  go  he's like  I'm not  coming  just go  with him  oh wait  a minute  so Nadine  even if I  could have  gotten  the plus  two  he wasn't  coming  anyway  yeah  actually he  feels really  uncomfortable  about it  and he didn't

[01:24:30]  best behind the music ever  man  thank you  who knew what was going on  it was  it was just honest  you know  yeah  i had no idea  they set that thing up the night before  and told me the night before  and i was like  no way i'm not doing it  really  i was scared to death  and i just  it was an anxiety attack man  but it turned out to be a good thing  it turned out to be a good thing  yeah  cause it seems like you guys made peace with each other  it was a car accident  you had  uh  what year was that  right back  two days before my 18th birthday  really  yeah  a few years ago  happy birthday 
[01:25:00]  yeah  well you were living  cause no one knew  actually what had happened to you  over the years  you know you remember you as a kid  and then all of a sudden  you disappeared from the face of the earth  you popped up in what  uh  the outsiders i guess  you were in that  yeah  that was in 83  and then uh  you know it disappeared again  and the next thing we saw  was that behind the music  it was like  holy gee  who knew this was happening  right  you fell right into that whole  stereotypical child's thought thing  man  it's so true man  i mean so many ways too  my life's been like that  you know  really 
[01:25:30]  yeah even if like  it's been like you know  getting ripped off by the old management  and everything  right  every one of the cliche stories  kiss me at least  please  every one of those cliche stories  at least give me a reach around  come on  yeah give me the reach around  at least  come on baby  that's funny  what started happening  like i could  all i could imagine  and all  all we really saw  was you're a kid  and you're just getting  i guess  booze drugs  and girls  thrown at you  at every corner  that's what it was man  like at 15  going on the road  right away  i did not have 
[01:26:00]  any parents on the road  with me  and i was  hanging with the guys  you know  so it was just like  nobody was carding me  in bars  you know  it was just crazy  like just happy to have you around  smoking and drinking  and you know  and i like the mothers  not the daughters  oh really was that it  really  oh yeah  wait let's call  dude  cause the chicks  look just like  forget about it  you couldn't pass by  a magazine stand  uh... back then  where you weren't just  all over everything  so you think like  in sync  uh...  they're actually  doing the moms  who knows  i don't know  if they're into it 
[01:26:30]  cause they and i  are trying to figure that out  it's totally possible  trust me  cause they and i  have talked about this  on the air  with like in sync  you know  they have all these  adoring little girls  that they can't touch  obviously  but i forgot about  the moms  they gotta be  you know  listen  girls are having  kids at 18  you know  yeah  yeah but we're talking  the kids are going  the kids are going  to concerts  they're looking fine  you know what i mean  yeah  so you were banging  the moms  you got a problem  with that  no  i think i rock  you know  you know  you gotta learn  somehow  and how old  were you  fifteen  sixteen 
[01:27:00]  and how old  were they  like thirty  yeah  like twenty  late twenty  that's like a dream  for a fifteen year old  isn't it  yeah  we all have those  weird fetishes  in school and stuff  you want to do  like the mom next door  the housewife  whatever  the teacher  when you're fifteen  there's no thrill  in banging a fifteen  year old  cause you're fifteen  now i'm thirty  three  i mean i would spend  a lot of cash  to do that  but when you're fifteen  you've never been to  Thailand  with a different man  no but you know  it's like uh  back in that's  when i'm back  in two fifty four 
[01:27:30]  days man  you know  i was you know  leaving with  kelly lebrock  and stuff like  that  now it's studio  fifty four  how old  in there  fifteen  and they're  letting you  in that place  say it again  oh yeah  steve rebelled  back in  hey  you want a little  schnitzky  you know  come on  it's like  sure steve  whatever  and then i guess  at that age  you just have  no self-control  over you know  hey  maybe if i  do too much  of this  it's gonna  really f me  up  you don't even  think that way  at that age  yeah  it's just like  you got it  bring it on  you're indestructible  what age  what age did you do 
[01:28:00]  coke man  i need to know  oh man  guys i don't know  sixteen  seventeen  yeah  yeah a lot of  people do that  true barrymore  was a lot younger  yeah  it's that  who got you on  like heroin  and stuff  who got you  doing that  i don't know  nobody really  got me on it  you know  i was just thinking  it's gotta be a first  time  i think i did that  one myself  it's not like  they held them down  i just can't get  into the mindset  there's gotta be  a point where  you're going  okay  you know  coke is one thing  pot's another thing  even popping a few  pills or whatnot 
[01:28:30]  you obviously never tried  no you're right  you know something  but that's what i hear  from anyone who has  done it  it's like  but you gotta cross  that line  where you're like  alright  now this is  friggin' heroin  no i hear what you're saying  i hear what you're saying  and i was scared to death  of it as growing up  and i saw people  doing it when i was  really young  you know  but uh  it was  because i never  i'm not  i'm definitely afraid  of needles  i was smoking it  oh you are  when i found out  there's a way to smoke it  we all thought  it was opium  you know  which is basically  the same thing anyway  you know  it doesn't sound as bad 
[01:29:00]  if you're smoking opium  hey a little opium  it's not like  i'm doing heroin  you can't really get  addicted to opium  it's not opiate paste  or anything like that  it's just called opium  a little paste  damn  but uh  you know  one thing leads  to another three days  in a row  and you're hooked  yeah  it's all it took  seriously  it went fast huh  because it's  it's easy to do  wow  i was hanging out  with like waylon  and navarro  and all those guys  but they all got clean  at the same time  we all got clean  at the same time  yeah  that must have been 
[01:29:30]  a hell of a party  hanging with those guys  every day  like just hanging out  scoring and hanging  jeez man  what happened though  like all of a sudden  you know  you're pretty much  on the top of the world  as a kid  you know  you're on a bunch  of tv shows  and doing movies  and then what  did it just  start slowing down  or go away  i never had  i never  you know  at 15  i had to be an adult  you know  yeah  so like  in my 20s  you know  i wanted to be a teenager  you know  and then  obviously 
[01:30:00]  you know  what was once  a ritual  became habitual  you know  and then  you're stuck  you know  but  you know  getting busted  was one of the best  things that ever happened  to me  you know  because i tried cold turkey  and that's just  impossible  and you know  so i went to  what's the story  rapid detox  what's the story  of you getting busted  how did that  come about  oh  foolish thing  i had it in my pocket  trying to score downtown  you know  oh damn  not a good thing  did you try to go  hey man

[01:38:00]  What a patriotic moment that was.  It was much better than the tribute last night.  Hey, we're blowing off Leif Garrett here, though.  Leif, go back to Leif.  I'm laughing.  Because he's very important to Leif.  Leif is going to be at B.B. King's, right? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Tonight at B.B. King's?  No, no, no.  We're Maxwell's tonight in Jersey.  Maxwell's in Jersey with the band.  You got your band with you, right?  I hope they have chicken fingers.  All right, Mariel, we'll talk to you soon, man.  Sure, just blow me off.  Well, I don't care.  All being the operative word.  All right.  Well, ask him something.  Hey, I already talked about Three for the Row, which he probably hasn't been talking about that.  How was the last time someone brought up Three for the Road?  What's that?  When's the last time somebody brought up Three for the Road?  No.  A long time ago. 
[01:39:00]  I believe it was 1979 the day it was canceled.  Someone's writing in saying that Leif was in a foosball movie.  A what?  Oh, God.  Were you in a foosball movie?  Which one was that?  What's a foosball movie?  God.  What is that?  It's like Jesus Christ.  Please educate me again.  I think he'd rather talk about his heroin abuse than that movie.  Nobody brought up the drugs.  We brought up the drugs.  He was honest.  Eric Estrada wanted a Coke off him. 
[01:39:30]  Did he?  And he was banging Kelly LeBrock when he was, what, 15, 16?  I know.  I prefer to use the term make love.  Yeah, he does.  I only love Brock.  Because you think you still have a shot with her, right?  She's still hot.  Yeah, I'm kidding.  He was a teen idol.  He was like Coach David Cassidy, teen idol.  Yeah, I know.  He was it.  Yeah.  And you know what we also learned from him?  He was banging the moms.  He was?  Yeah.  He was banging the moms?  I was trying to figure out how that works with these old teen stars, and they weren't  going for their fans. 
[01:40:00]  They were doing the moms.  Yeah, happy Mother's Day, ma'am.  Here's my penis.  Something like that.  I'm going.  All right.  Hey, you killed today.  Thank you.  Killed.  I love you guys, and I will see you very soon.  All right.  We'd love you, too.  It was great talking to you, too.  Nice talking to you, man.  Good luck with everything.  Kick-ass at Maxwell's.  And baby King's.  And I'm going to be wearing my ass.  Kick my ass at back.  There he goes, Mario.  Tanto.  Oh, my God.  Mario used to do a kid's show here in New York.  Really?  Out of New Jersey, actually.  Steampipe Alley, it was called. 
[01:40:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And you'd watch it.  And the autumn around children.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, I would watch it even back then.  I'd be watching going, this.  This guy's the host of a kid's show?  It's the Pee Wee Herman syndrome.  Yeah, it was pretty much like that.  I'm like, he's doing like Joan Crawford impressions to the kids,  and the kid's got like no clue look in their face.  So you've got to tell us the plot of the foosball movie.  I'm going to go rent it tonight.  Dude, I don't even think there was one.  You're just playing foosball.  It's just bad. 
[01:41:00]  This is the Scotty brothers thinking, hey, we can start it.  We started a record label with him.  We can start a movie from a production company with him.  That's classic.  Let's do a movie about, let's see, foosball.  That's the right now.  What a hot topic that one is.  Hey, Ron, what's up?  Hey, Leif, I just want to ask you, what was it like to play Tommy on 8 is Enough?  Why don't you know?  That's the smart guy.  That's the wrong show.  That's the other guy.  You dick.  That's Willie Ames.  All right, why don't we take a break?  You can hang for a little while, right?  We'll talk about the video stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Dude, do you know Ozzy Osbourne?  I've got a great story about Ozzy, man.  All right, we'll tell it after the break.  That's a good radio piece right there.  He's the hugest Ozzy fan.  All right, okay.  And also Stephanie from Washington.  We'll get her in here next as well.  Right.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's a squid.  It's a big squid.  It's a big squid.  Coming soon, the return of the 55-gallon drum challenge on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:42:00]  Look who's in the studio, Ant.  Leif Garrett.  Yeah.  Having fun, Leif?  So far.  You don't want to be here, do you?  No, no, no.  Do I look scared?  No, you don't look scared at all.  Jeff wants to ask you a question.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, hey, how you doing?  All right.  Hey, listen, I'm 36, right, Leif?  How old are you?  I just turned 40.  Okay, cool. 
[01:42:30]  You are on Family, right?  Yeah.  Okay, let me tell you something.  Me and my brother have four older sisters, and the reason why we wanted to kick your ass  was not because we had to watch the show because you were on it, but they were watching the show anyway.  Let me ask you a question.  Christy McNichol.  Come on, man.  She was a little dyke by the time she was five.  What was it like making out with her?  What are you insane?  I like the question, though.  Dude, really?  No, I never made out with her.  Yeah, how many kissing scenes were on that show?  I remember you trying to, like, get some of that. 
[01:43:00]  Well, yeah, I was trying to get some of it, but it was like, hey, buddy, I've got needs, too.  Yeah.  There was no tongue action or anything like that.  Just trying to force yourself on it a little bit.  Hey, I've got to admit, though, man, we were listening to your story, and now, like, we're older and everything.  We don't want to kick your ass anymore.  We want to kick you out for a beer if that's allowable.  Of course, man.  Right on.  You still do the beers, Leif?  Of course.  Dude, you know who hit Christy McNichol like things?  Armand Asante and Little Darlings.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you think he banged her, you say?  Yeah, he was, like, 20 years older than Armand. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's a scary little man.  Oh, the Aussie story.  The Aussie story.  I'm sorry.  Okay, I'm not sure why these people always ask me the same questions.  He's like, when reputation precedes me, but he's coming out of the bathroom at the whiskey  bar, and that's the one they have at the Paramount Hotel, but the one in Los Angeles, and I'm  coming out, and I see, as I round the corner, Aussie comes staggering towards me, and he's  like, full tilt and full tilt.  He goes, you. 
[01:44:00]  You look like you have cocaine.  Oh, man.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  The Aussie story.  What was this?  It was, like, about four or five years ago.  You.  Well, did you?  No, I just finished it.  Yeah, that's right.  Very good.  No one ever has cocaine for somebody to ask for.  He might have hit me up going into the stall.  You're going to lose yourself, too?  Never coming out.  It was useless.  He was blind as a bat. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, be careful, because Aussie listens to our show, Leif.  He might just call her.  That's all right with me.  All right.  Aussie, you remember me?  Aussie from St. James.  We can't get away from this.  Somebody commenting on Long Shot, which was the foosball movie.  That was the foosball movie, yeah, yeah.  Says, let's see.  And it's this really, a really bad song that went along with it.  I'm looking for a long shot to come through.  I guess there was a song.  You didn't perform that, did you?  I had nothing to do with that.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes, it was really bad. 
[01:45:00]  The guy ordered it.  Said, it's a foosball spectacular comedy drama about a kid who's trying to make 50 grand playing  in a Tahoe foosball national championship.  There's laughs and loves and nonstop foosball action.  Yeah, nonstop foosball action.  And how's this for cliche, right?  It's like they turned down a three-picture deal with Paramount and Universal for that.  Okay.  I'm going to slit my wrists.  The guy says, it's a boring, badly acted, and almost unwatchable, yet we love it. 
[01:45:30]  There's no hope for us.  We can't defend ourselves or this trash.  We just urge you to watch it.  That's classic.  Now, that makes me want to see it.  That's crazy.  You know what, I'm watching now.  Jennifer, what's going on?  You can find it.  Yeah.  Hi.  I'm on?  Yeah, you're on.  You're on.  You sound like you're in a car.  Oh, my gosh.  You're in a car?  I am in a car.  Where?  I'm driving in Rockland.  Rockland County?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And what do you want today?  I want to do the fake oak. 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  Yeah, that was kind of something we wanted to start up again, and it kind of went by the  wayside.  The five o'clock fake oak.  I usually don't fake it, but it's an exception.  Well, you'll fake it today.  It's an exception.  You'll fake it for the radio and for Leif, right?  This is good.  We get kind of a feel of what the girls sound like when they're in the sun.  Fake work.  Yeah, it's kind of nice.  Do you know Leif Garrett?  I've got to pull over, though, because it's kind of a little while I'm driving.  You just shut your eyes.  I mean, I did sometimes while I'm driving, but, you know. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  We haven't had one of these in a while.  Remember how we like it.  Start slow, build to a crescendo.  I need motivation, though.  What do you mean?  A little bit, like, uh...  Some hot talk.  No, you guys motivate me.  Don't make us work for it.  Oh, no.  We don't want to work for it.  It always sounds horrible.  Ugh, ugh, ugh.  Just moaning. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Okay.  Ready?  I'm going to stop right here.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're all waiting.  I'd like to be the guy passing by right now getting a glimpse of this happening in her car.  Yeah.  Like, wow, what the hell is going on over there?  What kind of seats did she order?  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:30]  What are you laughing at?  We were just getting into it.  It was working for me.  Now, get me a cigarette.  It was kind of cool.  I wanted to yell, push.  He's crowding. 
[01:48:00]  She had a nice rhythmic thing going there.  You did well, man.  All right.  Are you actually touching yourself at the moment?  You're shaking?  Why?  You were nervous to do that?  A little.  I'm still shaking, though.  You did a great job.  Sarah Garrett would like to know if you were touching yourself.  My legs are shaking.  Miss, miss, miss.  Were you touching yourself or were you just...  Yeah, I was.  Oh, there you go.  I like that even more.  But, you know, it wasn't real, though.  No, of course.  I understand.  My real ones are much...  Jennifer, you might have started something. 
[01:48:30]  We'll see you tomorrow, all right?  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  You're welcome.  Yeah, thank you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  We've got to say hi to Mark Burnett.  Mark?  Hey, guys.  What's up, Mark?  How do I follow that?  Our survivor friend?  Oh, no.  Is that what we're talking about?  Oh, that's right.  There's another one.  This is Survivor 25, right?  Right.  Mark?  You know Mark Burnett?  Leif?  He's the head muckety-muck of all the Survivor shows.  Executive producer?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Mark Burnett, you remember Leif Garrett? 
[01:49:00]  Who?  Leif Garrett, where the hell were you in the 70s?  Oh, boy.  He was on every magazine in the 70s, dude.  No, I'm only 17.  I don't remember.  No, of course I remember.  You remember Leif Garrett?  Yes.  All right.  He's hanging with us today, so...  The question is, he's hanging with you guys.  Is there a bunch of naked breasts around like I had when I was there?  Well, we've got a very attractive girl outside.  Yeah, and we're going to have her in here.  As a matter of fact, yeah, we should bring her in.  Yeah, bring her in.  Bring her in. 
[01:49:30]  So, Mark.  Don't get mad.  I'm just going to ask one question.  Why should we watch Survivor 8?  Actually, you should watch Survivor 25 because, actually, it's back to the island.  It regains all the momentum of Survivor 1 on the island.  Tonight's a great show.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, you know what?  You have to watch it and see.  I can't convince you guys.  You know what?  I shouldn't have to. 
[01:50:00]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Mark.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is Rudy.  You got any queers on the show?  Well, I want to know because, uh, the first one had that queer Richard, otherwise known  as Dick.  Dick.  You know Dick?  Yeah, I do know Dick.  And, uh, I think that Rudy should be on his own special with Brandon from, uh, Survivor  Africa.  That would be the best, uh, you are, can you imagine?  Yeah, we like Rudy.  We have him on the show every so often.  He's a pisser. 
[01:50:30]  He comes in every once in a while and he's just hilarious.  I don't know about them faggot people.  You're like, oh, okay, Rudy.  Well, once you reach a certain age, you're allowed to say whatever the hell you want with  impunity, I guess.  Seems to be the rule of thumb.  No, you know what?  Uh, the new Survivor's getting really good reviews, uh, in the paper today there, Mark.  So.  Yeah, you know, it's a matter of the chemistry.  I mean, I think on Africa, the chemistry didn't work as well with the people.  And being back on an island and it was the first one that me and Jeff Probst didn't  really want to come home and finish shooting that fast. 
[01:51:00]  I mean, normally we can't wait after 60 days to get home, but we had a good time.  Yeah.  I hate to interrupt you, but if you're busy, we could just play the interview we had with  you for the last Survivor.  Well, it sounds the same, right?  Dude, I have a question for you.  How come?  Let's do that.  I'm teasing, of course.  I love the fact that Mark Burnett has a sense of humor, though.  I know.  How come there's no, like, black guys or Puerto Rican guys?  Like, 80 percent, like, yuppie white people.  Why do they know? 
[01:51:30]  Like, I'm not even making money.  Why is that?  Mark, this is coming from a guy that doesn't watch TV.  Yeah, he doesn't even know about Survivor.  I guarantee he has no clue about Survivor.  No, I do.  What about Jervis?  Yeah, but I'm tired of him.  Well, that was two years ago.  Exactly.  But I just tell you.  You know, actually, this time we had this guy, Sean, who's from Harlem.  And make sure, on a minute-by-minute basis, you're a member from Harlem.  So we do have...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Hey, Mark, why don't you fill everybody in on where it is this time? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, the Marquesa is a group of islands 1,000 miles north of Tahiti.  1,000 miles north of Tahiti, okay.  South Pacific, if you're geographically challenged.  And it looks kind of like King Kong Island, with the towering mountains coming out of the ocean.  It's kind of a cool place.  There was cannibalism there less than 100 years ago.  Wow, that sounds dangerous.  Does anyone lose their face? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, give us something, Mark.  Give us something that we can look forward to this season.  Something just...  Okay, okay.  The thing you can appreciate in the first act, there's a...  I'll use Jeff Probst's words.  Sarah, in the first act, who has the best body money can buy, by the way.  Just think Cleopatra, when she comes into the beach.  I mean, there's something that, if you guys watch, there'll be a total Opie and Anthony moment in Act 1. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, really.  All right, well, I'll hold you to that.  Does that mean she's going to start puking all over the sand?  No, me, she has beautiful breasts.  And it's like, every time I've ever been and spoke to you guys, that's the number one subject.  So...  Well, he does know us.  And me, she has a nice face as well, because what you subjected me to last time I was there, I had to run away.  That's true.  You were surviving our show last time.  Mark...  That was rough.  Thank God you didn't show up yesterday, or you would have been in a thong as we're shooting blood at you. 
[01:53:30]  We had a girl in brawn panties, and we got these...  They were ultimate super soakers.  Yeah, they were the big super soaker water rifles.  They were like four feet long, really thick, and just ridiculous looking.  And we filled it up with pig's blood, or was it lamb's blood?  It was lamb's blood.  Lamb's blood.  And the girl had to stand about 15, 20 feet away, and we blasted her with the blood.  That was great.  It went everywhere.  Bloody girls, always good, always fun.  That's good, right?  At least pretty.  She was gorgeous.  Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  She was a cute little girl.  Hey, Mark.  I have to tell you that, honestly, it wasn't so much the size of the enormous breasts you subjected me to.  It was the faces that went with them.  I was scared to death, man.  Oh, I know.  That was the day that we had three or four girls that had just tremendous...  Is that the word?  Just huge boobs all over, Mark.  Hey, Mark, what's this about them having to get their own food?  There won't be any food available?  Yeah, it should always have been that way.  I mean, the last three, I didn't do it because I couldn't find on the island or wherever it were enough carbohydrates. 
[01:54:30]  You know, I don't give them carbohydrates.  They have less energy in the challenge.  They'll be pretty boring.  But this place, there was enough food.  They have to work really hard for it, but it works.  And no matches or anything?  No, they've got to use a magnifying glass.  So, you know, the fact of the matter is, a lot of people got a big rude awakening about they had to actually work for the food.  And it was very interesting to see if it was a meritocracy or not.  So, there was cannibalism on that island less than 100 years ago?  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  But really, these are the places where these warrior guys are still around those parts, have tattooed faces.  And even you guys have heard of Herman Melville, right?  Who wrote Moby Dick?  Yeah, we're pretty educated here, Mark.  We just don't like to show it.  Yeah, I'm sure.  That education thing's overrated, you know?  Yeah.  When you're doing a radio show.  Anyway, he escaped.  Herman Melville escaped from a wading ship and thought he was going to find friendly natives.  Ended up with the cannibals on this exact island.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that. 
[01:55:30]  Hey, Mark.  Are you surviving your divorce?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, B.  I don't even...  You know something, Mark?  I don't even like that joke.  No, it's not even a joke.  I'm getting raked.  It's a tough thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  It's a tough thing that, you know, a lot of people have to go through.  That's all I'm saying.  Ever since you guys brought me around those breasts, I've had problems in my life.  See?  It's like kryptonite.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, Mark.  Mark, we're looking forward to the 83rd. 
[01:56:00]  Consecutive season of Survivor.  It really is.  All kidding aside, it's getting very good reviews, so...  I'm watching tonight, Mark.  And I've got to be honest, I didn't watch many episodes of Africa.  I think that whole 9-11 thing kind of distracted a lot of people to reality programming.  But I think I'm ready to take a peek at Survivor again.  Yeah, sure.  Thank you.  And it was the opium Anthony moment in Act 1 when Cleopatra comes ashore.  I'll look for that.  We'll be discussing that tomorrow, then.  All right, guys. 
[01:56:30]  Take care.  Thank you, Mark.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  Mark Burnett.  There he goes.  You know he hangs up and just goes, a couple of wankers.  Why do I have to go on the show?  I hate those people.  I've got to plug me show, and it sucks that I've got to go on that blasted show.  Less than 100 years ago, there were cannibals.  I mean, the intrigue.  Woo!  You know something?  Where you're standing right now, I bet you 10 million years ago, probably dinosaurs around.  How frightening is that to think about?  Woo!  Horrific.  Oh, I can almost feel one over my shoulder.  Hey, we're going to have to let Leif go in a little bit here. 
[01:57:00]  So, we've got to talk about the music real fast.  I mean, yeah, what's going on now?  The new band is F8, right?  F8, and it's rock and roll, man.  And you guys are playing Maxwell's and Hoboken?  Yep.  What kind of sound is it?  Like, uh, is it...  I can't really categorize it.  Is it rock and roll?  It's, I don't know, Zeppelin meets Still in Temple and Alice in Chains.  I was going to say, because you were doing the heroin with Scott and Dave Navarro, I'm  thinking a little Red Hot Chili Pepper, Jane's Addiction, STP thing happening, no?  Yeah, you could say that.  I don't know so much the Jane's Addiction thing, although I love that band. 
[01:57:30]  You don't do Put Your Head on My Shoulder, do you?  If you want me to.  You guys couldn't pay me enough to do any of that stuff.  You couldn't pay me enough.  This is deja vu for us.  I feel like I'm talking to Vanilla Ice again.  Oh, what?  When Vanilla Ice was in?  He just did a remake of Ice Ice Baby.  I kind of like the new sound that, you know, we were listening to when he was in here.  You're doing the same thing, though, changing your image, and you really don't want to go 
[01:58:00]  back to the old days, obviously.  No, not at all, man.  Not at all.  But everyone brings it up wherever you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bastards.  Vanilla Ice.  They're doing a thing.  Dick Clark Productions is doing a show.  Yeah.  They wanted me to box Vanilla Ice.  Oh, that whole gag.  They got Tonya Harding is going to be boxing Amy Fisher.  We're talking about a convicted felon for attempted murder, and now, hey, hey, let's bring it  on to the Wacky Fox channel.  And Danny Partridge and Greg Brady. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, Danny Banducci's fighting Greg Brady.  Yeah, Greg Brady.  And they wanted you to fight who?  Vanilla Ice.  Vanilla Ice.  That would rock.  Why not?  Because he'd probably kick my ass.  He looks pretty tough.  You couldn't pay me enough to go on television and get my ass kicked.  Yeah, you're probably right.  Oh, my God.  You know, they're filming.  They're coming up.  It's really soon.  I think they ought to have...  I'd like to train a bit, you know.  Yeah, really.  They ought to have Vanilla Ice and Suge Knight box it out.  Wouldn't that be great?  That would be great.  Hold him over a balcony and just punch his face.  Make him sign a contract. 
[01:59:00]  Mike has a question.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  How's it going?  All right.  All right, check it out.  Lee, on your list of things to do, I know you got Kelly with Rock checked off.  What do you do for kicks, man?  Do you rock and roll or do you just like the rest of us?  Do you get stoned every once in a while?  What is it?  Rock and roll, man.  Rock and roll.  Yeah.  I've got a few cocktails here and there.  But the rock and roll, is that a good outlet for you?  Is that how you like?  You have fun.  I don't think you have many things left to do, man.  What do you mean?  Like there's no life after drugs?  After Kelly LeBrock at 15. 
[01:59:30]  I don't know what to do after that.  Yeah, you blew your wad early, man.  No.  I can't believe LeBrock at 15.  It's like, what do you do after that?  It gets real after that.  You're right, Mike.  I don't agree with that, man.  You find different things in your life.  Well, life keeps on going.  You know, hey, everybody's mobile.  Life keeps on going for all of us.  We all do a little bit here and there.  You know, we need a little bit then.  We need a little bit next time.  You know, that keeps going for all of us.  But I'm saying, what do you look forward to?  How do you get off?  That's what I'm saying.  Is it rock and roll?  Is it in front of a crowd like that?  Yeah, but I mean, I don't literally get off in front of a crowd. 
[02:00:00]  You know, how goodful women are still around.  You're just making money with this rock and roll thing.  It's just how you'd rather make money like this than, you know, put up sheetrock.  You'd rather rock and roll.  That's how you make some money.  Is that what you're saying?  You know, yeah.  I'm not pumping gas.  Trust me on that.  Well, rock and roll, that's not a bad way to do it.  You know, people listen to that.  Yeah, they do it at all.  All right.  I didn't know you partook in a couple of beers every so often.  We'd have had some beers for you.  Of course.  Come on.  I didn't even drink a beer because I thought, hey, you know.  You know, I'm subscribed that you can't do anything. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I don't buy that.  I'm sorry.  I like that, too.  I like that attitude.  You know, you just got to know what you don't want to be a slave to, you know?  Hmm.  So.  Uh, Gus.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Lave.  How you doing, man?  How's it going, man?  Hey, listen.  I think you're playing the club where my band played last night.  You're playing the Court Tavern tomorrow?  Uh, not.  No.  Tonight we're playing, uh.  Maxwell's in Hoboken.  Maxwell's.  And then Tuesday, March.  But we are playing the Tavern at some point, I think.  I think tomorrow night you're playing the Tavern, yeah. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  Because, uh, we're going to be playing right around the corner for a minute, so I'll pop  in and say hi if that's cool.  Right on, man.  What's your band name?  Juggly Sons.  All right.  Juggly Sons.  We're going to be right around the corner.  So we played the Court last night, actually.  All right, Gus.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Any other, uh, 70s or 80s starlets we can know about, uh, before you?  Yeah.  So we can live through you?  Live vicariously through.  I don't know.  Did you pull any, like, R. Kelly stunts when you got a little older?  How about, I live, my new idol, by the way.  What, what's that about?  What was that about?  The, uh, the problems he's having now with the underage girls and the golden, oh, he's 
[02:01:30]  a classic.  No, no.  Oh, he's a classic.  I'm not a pedophile.  No, me neither, but I admire him for it.  I can't play football either.  I still like Tony Dorsett.  The topical reference, fat breasts.  Oh, my God.  Tony Dorsett retired.  He hates himself.  He's so self-hating.  I think he was in that roller, uh, ball, uh, no, that roller skating episode.  That's who I yanked out of football now is Tony Dorsett.  That was good.  We know you're a Cowboys fan, so shut up. 
[02:02:00]  Nothing to do with it.  If I was, I would have mentioned somebody more recently.  Mark, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  How are you, man?  Hey, Leif.  How's it going, man?  Good.  I just want to know, if you still keep in touch with, uh, with your friend, when was  the last time you saw him?  Uh, I haven't seen him in a while.  Really?  I'm not, I'm not gonna lie to you.  I mean, we've talked a few times since then, but, you know, it's a lot of years that went  by and a lot of garbage went down between us with attorneys and stuff like that.  So, I mean, as genuine as it was, it's not like we're ever, I mean, you know, become  best friends all of a sudden overnight.  It just doesn't happen to them.  Did he get a better haircut? 
[02:02:30]  I don't think so.  That's right.  I think he's still looking like he's in Leonard Skinner or something.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Take it easy.  Leif, good luck, man.  Thanks, Leif.  All right.  All right.  We got to get him out of here, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Where's the gig?  Uh, Maxwell's in Hoboken tonight with Leifgaard.  Check it out.  And the new band F8.  Check it out, okay?  Calm down, you guys.  Thanks a lot, you guys.  All right.  And we're going to say hi to Stephanie next from Washington, D.C.  I'm going to say hi to you.  I got the cheddar.  I could pay the rent.  For a great deal.  All right. 
[02:03:00]  See, a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  Call me daddy.  I'm your cheddar man.  All right.  Hope you like crap.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Felt like I was just in the principal's office.  Why'd you run away at the good part?  Couple phone numbers in the New York area. 
[02:03:30]  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philly.  Eight, six, six, two, seven, seven, four.  Wow.  That's eight, six, six, two, seven, seven, four.  Wow.  I needed a dumb button on that last phone call.  I never heard so much foul language.  I always have to walk.  I always have to walk when I'm being yelled at.  You left during a very important phone call, Hopey.  It goes back to when I was a child.  I had to hear the rest of it. 
[02:04:00]  There was a lot of yelling that went on in my house sometimes.  Yeah.  It goes back to that.  I tune out when people yell at me.  He was yelling at me.  He was using the F word.  I get psychotic when someone yells at me.  Boy, am I glad I shut up today.  I told you to shut up.  You were right.  You're a smart man.  You're a very smart man.  Okay, a couple things going on here, Anthony.  Look who's in the studio, and she's scared to be here now. 
[02:04:30]  The lovely...  Hey, go away.  Keep Patty out there.  Don't mess up my view already.  The lovely Stephanie.  Stephanie, the winner of the Naughty Nighty Contest.  You know her as contestant number 37, but she won the whole damn thing, and she's going  to Hedonism 3.  And you're beautiful, man.  I mean, we saw all your pictures, but to see you live, I feel like, oh my God, that's  a celebrity here.  Look for me.  I know.  Look, I've seen all your pictures.  They're beautiful.  She was hot in the pictures, but in person, she's even hotter. 
[02:05:00]  She's really attractive.  Yeah.  Yeah, it bugs me.  You'll like it.  Yeah.  Looks like she tanned for her visit to New York.  A little tan, right?  It's okay.  A little tan.  Are you dead?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Un poquito.  A little bit.  A little bit.  And what do you do for a living?  Surgical assistant.  Yeah, she's the surgical assistant.  And she brought...  Wasn't it oral surgery?  It's very.  Yeah, it's the oral surgery she assists in.  Now, a few things.  Right after the show tonight at Hooters on 56 between 7th and Broadway, we're going downstairs  to have a few beers with our listeners.  We'll be there, like, literally at 7, a little after, bringing Stephanie down. 
[02:05:30]  And I think Stephanie was a little nervous to come to New York because you brought pretty  much bodyguards.  Yeah.  Bodyguards?  Those guys are huge outside.  Oh, really?  One guy's trying to play foosball and his head is hitting the ceiling.  Look at him.  They're all mad.  They're all retards with you.  You call them retards?  Great, Norton.  Lurch and his friend?  Yeah.  Lurch, how tall is that guy?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, he's up there.  Where do you know them from?  Just friends or...  Yeah.  Oh.  But you brought them for protection, right? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  She's smart, man.  You don't go into a place with all our listeners and...  We don't bite.  You're not dating one of them?  Our listeners, though.  They might.  What, what, Jim?  I was just wondering if she was dating one of the 6'8 people.  No?  You got yourself one of those boyfriends?  Yeah, she nods.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right.  Sorry.  Do we get to see a wow in the studio live?  Uh-huh.  Oh.  It's a special day.  This is a very special day. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, what's going on?  What's the matter?  Oh, hey.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Hey, yeah, kid.  Hi, Garrett.  Stinky, is there a business in here?  There's a girl in here.  That's Garrett.  Don't you have, don't you have, don't you have, don't you have phones to, uh, answer?  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They can, uh, wait, I guess, Garrett believes.  Yes, Garrett.  All right.  Uh, Stephanie, let's, uh, let's do a wow.  Get that out of the way so we can concentrate on, uh.  Wow.  Oh, man. 
[02:07:00]  That's why it's called wow.  Dr. Dink.  You know what?  You did a great job with those.  You're so mad, right?  They're perfect.  Why are you mad?  Just look at me.  Mine are bigger and yours are nicer.  Jimmy?  Those are perfect.  Jimmy, show, uh, show Stephanie yours.  No, that'd be prop.  I can't do it.  He's not a prop comic.  That'd be natural.  It's not just come out.  Oh, come on.  I can never do it on command.  Is he carrot top now?  Exactly.  How about the body, uh,  Would you like me to smash fruit on my chair?  How about the belly?  No, I certainly won't.  How about the belly fat?  No.  If I feel like doing it, 
[02:07:30]  You know, here's the thing.  I wouldn't be angry and want to do that  because she has a boyfriend  so I wouldn't even think of asking her out.  If I was thinking of asking her out,  I would have the urge to pinch my fat  because I know she'd say no.  But she has a boyfriend  so it doesn't even occur to me.  Yeah.  That is the way that works.  Is your boyfriend happy that, uh,  you were kind of nude all over the internet?  Very.  You know how many people saw those pictures?  A couple million.  Yeah.  Easily.  Yeah.  You'll see tonight.  I bet.  Do you ever think guys might be doing, uh,  things to themselves 
[02:08:00]  looking at your pictures?  No, really.  I don't.  You don't think about that  or you just,  you don't want to think about that?  It doesn't bother you  to know absolutely  that guys are doing that?  that have called us  and described every detail  of them doing that?  I feel like we know each other.  I feel like we've met before  in the bushes  while I had a hammer.  All those fantasies.  Anthony,  it's, uh,  time to get that yummy taste  out of our mouths.  Yeah.  That yummy taste.  Open the door.  Yeah, bring, uh, 
[02:08:30]  have you heard us, uh,  talk about Stalker Patty  on this show?  Yeah, I have.  Yeah.  I picture her a little younger.  It's time to get to...  Oh, she's a gimp.  She's a 46-year-old virgin.  Bring in the gimp.  She's like so pathetic.  All right, here comes Patty.  I guess you better  wake her up then.  Oh, God.  Goddamn.  Patty.  I, just when you thought  it could not possibly  get any worse  for you.  Patty, what's with your arm?  I think you had foot surgery.  What is your arm?  You look like somebody 
[02:09:00]  who's paralyzed on one side  and their arm curls up.  No, it's just...  Talk into the mic.  How many times have you been  talking to the mic?  How many times have you been  on our show?  Talking to the mic.  Sorry.  What's the problem  with your arm?  Oh, nothing's wrong with it.  It's the way you hold it.  It's like you're all  crippled up.  No, I'm just not used  to the king.  I'm not used to the king.  Hey, Patty.  Can you believe her,  Stephanie, right?  Patty, take a look  to your left  to see what you would  look like in Bizarro World.  Right.  That's Bizarro World.  They love the  cliffhanger. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  If this doesn't prove  that God has a sense  of humor.  Oh.  Just a couple  of strands  of DNA.  A couple of genes  different.  You get the  sperm cell  swims.  Yeah.  And then one  hits the egg,  but the one  just behind it  would have been that.  No.  No, Joe,  this is a lot  more than that.  Really?  This is a lot  more than one  little sperm  missing by a quarter  inch.  This is 14 or  1500 years.  Right.  I think the sperm 
[02:10:00]  that produced Patty  got hit over the  head with a baseball  bat.  Do you think that?  You think it was  swimming in Lysol  before it hit?  No.  I do know that I  have music in my  blood because I'm  typo negative.  Shut up,  stupid.  Oh,  that's the band.  Awful.  Oh,  I know that  that's the band.  I thought because  you liked anthrax.  Stephanie and Patty  in the same show.  Die.  But a lot  different,  Anthony.  Yes.  Very different.  Look at that.  They are both  female, 
[02:10:30]  I think.  Right?  Well,  Patty,  now that the hair  is starting to grow  back,  you're really  looking like a boy  now.  Thank you.  I hope I look  like a girl soon  when it gets even  longer.  You're starting to  look like Elvis  Costello.  Yeah,  that is pretty good.  Is that a compliment?  Yeah,  women usually take  that as a compliment.  Tell them that it's  like Elvis Costello  Now,  what's with the  foot?  What's with the  gimpy foot?  She had a broken  reset and all that  to what?  Yeah,  I love that  what did I learn. 
[02:11:00]  That was interesting.  Well,  that's great,  Patty.  Maybe people  didn't hear that  because they're  listening right now.  You can catch me  on Broadway  as Peter Pan.  There it is.  Look at her.  There it is.  I'm Peter Pan.  It's like I have  little screws  in my foot  so the listener  quoted and said  that the foot  got screwed  before I did.  As far as you know,  you were under  anesthesia.  I remember that  laying down on a gurney  being driven home  in an ambulance  after I came out.  An ambulance.  An ambulance.  An ambulance. 
[02:11:30]  You didn't have a ride  to the hospital  or to the office  or back home,  did you?  You didn't have a friend.  Yeah, but I got a ride  back home.  You didn't have a friend  to take you, right?  Well, I wasn't going  to ask people  to come all the way  out to Long Island.  That's too far  for people.  Oh, yeah.  The backwoods  of Long Island.  Did you have to pay  for the ambulance?  No.  The ambulance?  The medicate covers it.  Yeah.  And now you've got  one foot done.  Yeah.  And when that heals, 
[02:12:00]  then they'll do the other foot.  They'll do the other foot.  It took a lot more work  than they first anticipated,  didn't it?  Well, I guess it took  a little work.  Yeah, I was out  for two hours.  First, they gave me  the Valium.  Then they gave me  something in the IV.  Then they said  they were going to give me  the good stuff,  and that's the last  thing I remember.  Yeah, it's called  his mule  when you went to sleep.  I thought it was  extra oxygen or something.  Did you wake up  with a bleeding tuchus  and five men laughing  in a circle around you?  No.  I woke up  and everybody said 
[02:12:30]  the X-rays looked good  and stuff,  and the first thing  I asked for  was my walkman  so I could listen  to the show.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, nice.  Here's for the workman.  She's got the feet  of a jackal.  Well, the sad part  is only one was done.  Yeah.  Well, you can only  do one at a time.  I need another good one.  Stephanie, would you  like to see a foot?  Well, you've got  nowhere to go, Patty.  Show Stephanie  the foot that wasn't  done yet.  This is the foot  that's not done yet.  Well, I think she  can figure that out. 
[02:13:00]  It's the one that  doesn't have the big  huge cast on it.  Pull the sock off.  Look at this big  nasty...  It's awful.  Isn't that awful?  You're not clipping  your toe like that.  Her foot has a...  Did you hear that?  Oh, my God.  What, Stephanie?  That's a bunion.  It's an onion.  Your foot has a shoulder,  Patty.  It's not normal.  It has an elbow.  It's like her foot  is always going...  Hubbler, hubbler,  rib rib.  By the time summer  comes, I'll be able  to wear open sandals  and do stuff 
[02:13:30]  with my toes again.  Do stuff?  What do you do  with your toes?  Like what?  Nice fingernail  polish on them.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Make it look nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, put a band-aid  on Kennedy's head.  Okay.  I use it to pick up  food with to bring  back to the nest  for the young birds.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, I didn't know  y'all were doing  a radio play.  You got Beauty  and the Beast in there. 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  Norton rules.  Yeah, Norton rules.  Town Hall, April 18th.  Tickets, ticket master.  Got to give it to you.  Oh, by the way,  Philadelphia...  JFK line.  Thank you.  Somebody called  Philadelphia.  There's 23 tickets  left in Philadelphia  for the final show  on Saturday.  Wow, that's it?  Yeah.  All right.  Stephanie,  what do you think  of Stalker Patty?  I thought you were  going to be a little younger.  Oh, I thought you were  going to say  a little something else-er.  No, she's 45?  46.  She's a 46-year-old virgin.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, doesn't that  sound hot?  Ugh.  She just never used it.  It went to waste.  It went bad.  It rotted on the vine.  Rotted on the vine.  That thing is never  getting used, Patty.  Face it.  Fix your feet.  Paint your toes.  That lap is never,  ever getting used.  Right?  Do not resign  to the fact that  you'll be on your  deathbed going,  I should have  had some  sexual experiences. 
[02:15:00]  Well, let me tell you,  I got a piece of paper  in my pocketbook  that says all the  stuff that I could do  and the last item  that was checked  that I could do  was have sex.  Why?  Are there certain  things you can't do?  I thought it was so funny.  What can't you do now?  There's not much  of anything I can't do.  You know, I can't run.  A point of football?  You know, huddle, huddle.  Hey, you work for an  oral surgeon, right?  Uh-huh.  That's a tooth doctor?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  What do you think  of Patty's teeth?  What do you think of those?  Doesn't it look like  she was smiling,  turned her head sideways,  and smashed her face  into a bandsaw?  She's got like those  little nubby,  little chiclet.  You know the mini chiclets?  Yeah.  Tiny teeth.  She's got the little  mini chiclet teeth.  And they're endearing.  Yeah.  Endearing?  Really?  Best I could do.  Don't they look like,  she's got JonBenet Ramsey teeth.  Those little, tiny...  Someday, 
[02:16:00]  I'll be a Miss America.  Someday,  can't even hear that song  without wanting to  whack my bag.  What?  Stop, man.  We got a hot girl  in the studio.  All right.  Well,  nothing they could do  about that?  Don't they have things  called laminates or something?  Can't you have laminates?  Veneers.  They call it veneers.  You can't just put one  over her entire face.  What do you suggest  for Patty's teeth? 
[02:16:30]  Patty, smile.  Go,  eee.  Give it a good smile  for Steph.  What do you think?  You really can't  too much for that.  Yeah, I bet.  You're talking about  her teeth or her as a whole?  Her teeth.  Yeah?  They're called mandibles  with my aunt body.  I got my big,  giant mandibles.  I could carry a hundred  times with my own weight.  Doesn't she have  the body of an ant?  She should have another  set of arms sticking  out of her hips.  She does.  Right?  Man, if we're not  dedicated to our listeners, 
[02:17:00]  I'll tell you.  It was so easy  just to blow off Patty  and hang with the hotness.  Yeah.  But we had her bring in  the sickness.  The sickness.  Oh, shit.  And people are noticing.  Anthony, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Right now in the studio,  you've got the pros and cons  of being a gynecologist.  You know,  that's the truth, right?  Imagine you're the dyno, right?  And Stephanie comes in,  oh, I'm here for my checkup.  I made the right choice  in medical school.  I'm here for my pap smear.  You're like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, you go from 
[02:17:30]  someone all nicey-nice  to Fulton Street real fast.  And then Patty comes in,  I got him, Rish.  I'm like, oh, God.  You guys rock, dude.  All right, Anthony.  I don't know what happened.  I sat down  and I saw cube webs.  Well, it's from lack of use.  What do you got to do?  Grease the fittings  every so often  and keep it pliable?  Like you do with a  grease fitting or something?  No.  Trust me,  I'll be ready  when the moment comes.  Oh, stop. 
[02:18:00]  The moment's never coming.  Except that it's all right.  It's never going to happen.  Yeah, face it, though.  I like the fact  that Patty's a dreamer, though.  There's a difference  between being a dreamer  and just being completely deluded.  Good.  Stephanie, can I ask you  when your first experience was?  Just an age.  No details.  Good, good, good.  Fifteen.  Fifteen.  Nice.  Now we need details?  Sixteen.  Yeah.  Just two kids effing.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, the good old days.  Having fun. 
[02:18:30]  Backseat of a car, maybe.  Sometimes.  One of the spots.  That age without  serious repercussions.  What are you talking about?  Would you?  Where are you doing it?  The bingo game  where they could see?  Patty, you were supposed  to have sown  your wild oats  at an earlier age.  By 18 at the...  Yeah.  At the least.  I was also involved  in too many religious groups.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, so only the young boys  can have sex?  Let me tell you something, though.  I was involved  with a lot of religious groups 
[02:19:00]  growing up.  Uh-oh.  Before I saw  the dark side.  Opie, were you an altar boy?  No, I didn't go...  No church activities?  No, like...  No, like...  Little blonde locks.  Oh, man.  Imagine how they would  have gone after him  at about 12, 13.  In the inner tea oven.  Tussle his hair.  Church groups and stuff.  Activity.  Hide under my frock.  Well-defined abs  from caddying.  Actually, I had nice shoulders  back then.  Of course you did.  Smooth little blonde boy.  Heck.  What's up with you, dude? 
[02:19:30]  Clergyman could just come up  and give him a little massage  on the shoulders.  Hey, how you doing today?  Hey, was he carrying  your bags this weekend?  Did a good job  with those candles  this Sunday.  Anyway, they...  Mind if I suck your C?  Did I go too far?  There were religious  retreats and stuff, Ant?  Yeah.  And there was a lot  of effing that went on  on these religious  retreats there, Patty.  I'm not surprised.  And we went on these  retreats in the name  of God there.  Wow.  I know.  And what about you, Patty?  That's why I'm not  really involved  with that anymore.  Patty, did men 
[02:20:00]  or boys  that were your age  ever, ever  make passes at you  when you were younger?  Well, I remember  one time  when I was about  17 years old  I was friends  with a group of kids  and this one guy  wanted to kiss me  and I got scared  and said no  because my foster parents  had spies  and they would get  phone calls  my behavior  and spies.  Spies?  Why didn't you  camouflage the room  with tarps  like our own  Jeremy Coleman  says you should do?  I saw your daughter  and I didn't want  to get in trouble.  I saw your daughter 
[02:20:30]  she's quite a whore.  They were old  you know  very old fashioned.  Let's compare  so a guy  made a pass  at you  29 years ago  right?  Right.  29 years ago  is the first  recollection she has.  Stephanie  when was the last time  a guy made a pass  at you?  The other day.  Five minutes ago?  Yeah.  As soon as you  showed up.  I do get any of the stuff  by 25 year olds  sometimes  and that gets  a little embarrassing.  Wait wait  what's your delusion  this time?  It's not a delusion  I have been asked  out by 25 year olds 
[02:21:00]  but you know  What's wrong with that?  What do they say  they ask you out?  How do they ask you out?  A few things wrong.  25 year olds.  You know.  She always taught  you know  the way she talks  I get asked out  sometimes  by 25 year olds.  You know.  I have good hygiene.  Hygiene.  Unfortunately  you guys my age  are either married gay  So what do  how do these guys  ask you out?  Yeah.  They just say  you know  kids a phone number  I've gotten  phone numbers  They put the knife  to our throat 
[02:21:30]  and say  don't make a move  and don't yell.  You know  it could be a problem  46.  21 year old guys  want to go out  with you.  That's got to be  a fraternity dare.  A hazing  hell week.
