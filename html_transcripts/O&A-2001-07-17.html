<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with sexually suggestive banter and euphemisms for masturbation.  A caller, Keith, recounted a graphic story about unexpectedly witnessing his parents having sex in a detailed position ("feet over the shoulders"), followed by his mother's call, adding further explicit details and revealing multiple instances of their children witnessing their sexual activity. This was followed by more caller stories detailing similar experiences of witnessing family members having sex, including one about a grandmother witnessing a sexual act from a car.  A significant portion then focused on the Asbury Park, New Jersey "Greek Fest" riot, with callers, including Vinny, detailing the violence, sexual assaults, and gun violence that occurred.  This segment was punctuated by advertising for LASIK surgery and Pinnacle Horny Goatweed. Comedian Richard Jeni was a guest, albeit a frustrated one, as the hosts repeatedly made him call in from the building's lobby despite his close proximity to the studio.  The show also featured a caller's story about biting her boyfriend during an attempted "makeup sex" session.

The show then shifted to 18-year-old Christy from Dallas (described as homeschooled), who had a brief, awkward interaction with the hosts. The focus then largely turned to Anthony's experience at a Spinal Tap concert, where he detailed encounters with Penn Jillette, Will from *Will & Grace* (with comments on Will's apparent attempts to downplay his gay character), and Stephen Van Zandt.  Anthony described Spinal Tap's less-than-stellar behavior and the hosts' feeling snubbed despite promoting the show.  This segment was riddled with homophobic slurs and derogatory comments directed at callers and celebrities, alongside vulgar discussions about a fictionalized VH1 Def Leppard movie. Jim Brewer was in the studio for a portion, and numerous calls continued, including multiple calls from Christy and a friend, Ashley, from Dallas, with ongoing sexually suggestive and offensive comments from the hosts. Attempts to book Opie and Anthony on Bill O'Reilly's show resulted in dropped calls and contentious exchanges.  The segment concluded with Jim Brewer's chaotic musical interlude.

A highly irreverent and sexually explicit discussion about Rob Halford (Judas Priest) followed, including homophobic slurs and graphic sexual comments.  The hosts linked Halford to a fictional VH1 movie starring Jim Brewer, fabricating absurd and offensive details about Brewer's life and sexual acts.  The "F.U. Line" segment featured angry calls directed at various people.  Two women from Dallas engaged in a sexually suggestive conversation with the hosts, who made derogatory remarks about their appearance.  Nicole from Cleveland, introducing herself as a "hot redhead," prompted more sexually charged banter.  One-legged boxer Jimmy called in, mentioning Penn & Teller's presence at a show. Paul Mercurio was in the studio throughout much of this segment.  The hosts discussed a negative *Time* magazine article about them, focusing on a perceived misrepresentation of Anthony's comment about Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.  Their anger was directed at the author, Joel Stein.  Cheryl, a recently evicted *Big Brother* contestant, called in, and the conversation became sexually charged, with the hosts making inappropriate comments about her appearance and motherhood. Tommy also joined the conversation with Cheryl.  The segment concluded with more calls, discussions of blind boxing, and a listener winning $100,000 in a contest.  Crude humor and offensive language dominated this segment.

The final segment began with a prank call where a listener was tricked into believing they won $100,000, only to receive a candy bar.  A Tiger Schulmann Karate commercial aired, interspersed with crude commentary from the hosts.  Paul Mercurio and Jim Brewer were in the studio, promoting Mercurio's show and Brewer's concert film, described as containing incriminating behind-the-scenes footage. Jokes about alcohol and drug use were prevalent.  The "What Did We Learn?" segment featured listeners sharing humorous, often sexually suggestive and offensive, takeaways from the show, including anecdotes about 18-year-old virgins from Dallas and a black worm on a window.  The segment concluded with more sexually explicit remarks and jokes. The show ended with a live read for Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed, accompanied by sexually suggestive comments, and a promotion for "Whip Them Out Wednesday".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And regard to...  Quacky!  That's a part of human sexuality, and it is perhaps to be taught.  Against the law, and you get arrested for it.  Beat the meat, bop the dishes.  I had my hand down my pants.  Choke the shit in.  Now your body's ready for the major pump.  Flog the dolphins, jerk the gherkins.  Ever seen a grown man naked?  Spank the monkeys.  You want to touch my monkey?  Opie and ask for me.  We've got to learn how to do this, dude.  Why did all the dinosaurs die out?  Because you touch yourself at night. 
[00:00:30]  I spent most of my teen years loving my body.  Go ahead, Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Yeah, well, you were saying how horrible it's to see your mom's boobs.  Yeah, if you inadvertently see your mom's boobs.  What?  Seeing your mom and dad do commando on the bed.  Commando!  What happened, Keith?  Oh, God.  I tried to forget it.  What happened?  You walked in on them?  Oh, yeah.  Early Saturday morning.  You opened...  You just flung the door open?  Opened it.  Was mom taking it from behind, or what?  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, what was happening?  Yeah, what position were they in, Keith?  Feet over the shoulders.  Whoa!  Wow!  That's the hi, how you doing?  Is your dad hung?  Huh?  Oh.  Is your dad hung?  I don't know.  But, like, were they making noise or anything?  It was pretty embarrassing, huh?  My mom's a professional.  She was moaning, huh? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  And then what happened when they saw you?  Well, their back was kind of facing to me, so I managed to get out.  Oh, they didn't see you?  They didn't ask you to join them?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, man, you got...  Who are you, Rick, today?  Taking it too far?  I took a hit on the head this morning, and I'm terrible.  Think I'm spaz?  Hey, this kid's quick.  Even 12-year-olds think I'm on spaz.  So, did you enjoy it?  I mean... 
[00:02:00]  Oh.  Was that the first time you ever seen, you know, people having sex?  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, man.  Has your dad told you about the birds and the bees yet?  Actually, my brother did.  What did he tell you?  Well, it started with this question, what hole does he go into?  My father said, whatever one's open. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Is your dad's name Jackie?  No, not that one.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Keith, you're all right, man.  I mean, I guess you'll do okay.  All right.  Anything else?  Rather not say.  Okay.  You guys suck.  All right.  So does your mom, Keith.  All right. 
[00:03:00]  Call back any time, all right?  Okay.  All right.  There he goes, Keith, everyone.  He's pretty funny.  He's very funny.  He's a funny little lad.  Keith's mom is on the line?  Oh, no.  Come on.  No way.  Keith's mom.  Hey, yes.  I'm Keith's mom.  All right.  Now, Keith was...  You sound a lot like Keith.  He caught you and Daddy having sex.  Well, Tony says, I mean, I was unaware of that, but it reminded us, first of all, they  deserve whatever they get because they never leave us alone. 
[00:03:30]  And we try to barricade our room.  And if that doesn't work, they hear the bed squeaking.  They take a broom handle and bang on the living room ceiling.  It's a clue as then, yes.  But what I wanted to say was it reminded me when I heard him on the radio.  Your voice sounds a little hoarse.  Yeah.  Anyway, my nephew one time...  The pink tip white owl.  The white owl.  No, I don't smoke cigars. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah, sure.  The cigar, the brand is called Keith's dad.  What?  Nothing.  Go ahead, Keith's mom.  Anyway, one time my nephew was...  We had, like, company and my husband, he wanted to have a matinee.  So, what we do is we shut the bedroom door and then we open the closet door so it goes  against the bedroom door.  You barricade it in a little bit, yeah.  Right, double door.  And we're having, like, a final time up there.  And all of a sudden, the kids, I didn't know it, they were playing hide and seek. 
[00:04:30]  So is your husband.  Hide the salami.  No, we were...  Yeah, we're not that way.  Seat the meat.  Oh, my God.  Listen to her voice.  And we're both pretty big people, you know?  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Also, poor Keith saw two fat people having sex.  Oh, yeah.  You know, like, is it in? 
[00:05:00]  Listen to her.  Now we know where your son gets his chops from, man.  I know.  There's one good thing he put there.  It's a comedic family here.  Okay, go ahead.  So we're up there and all of a sudden the door, my nephew hit the bedroom door so hard  that the closet door swung shut, the bedroom door opened, and there he was.  Well, I never saw my husband jump off.  He did like a pirouette in the sky and landed on the floor.  So my nephew, he just went like, oh, sorry. 
[00:05:30]  It's going to make you puke.  No, no.  So he runs out of the room.  So now my husband wants to, like, start and, you know, just where he left off.  I was like, no, God, I can't.  I can't now.  You know, like, forget it.  Wait till later.  Oh, man.  You left him hanging?  Yes.  What a messed up family.  You're having sex.  Your kids get to watch you.  Nephews, nieces, whoever the hell wants to open the door.  Hide and seek going on.  You got company downstairs.  You need to screw upstairs.  It was the worst position ever you could have fined so much. 
[00:06:00]  Uh-oh.  What were you doing?  We were f***ing out.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  I don't even know what that made on the radio.  If that didn't make it on the air, let's just say.  Okay.  Yeah, you could say numbers.  69.  Filet of fish.  Hold the cheese.  So I felt like I had to say something to my nephew.  All of a sudden, the kid had to hanker in for some Arby's roast beef sandwich. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, well, no.  I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable.  I took him downstairs, and I pointed my finger in his face, and I said, I hope you have nightmares for the rest of your life.  I will.  What's coming off of that finger?  How much does Mom and Dad weigh?  I just need to really picture this right now.  Well, we're very tall.  How much do you weigh?  Well, I'm about two.  All right.  Two bills, huh?  He's about 260.  And you guys were in the 69 position. 
[00:07:00]  Your kids checked that out.  No, I asked you.  Wow.  Hey, but at least I was facing the other way.  Oh, so the kid got the bob shot?  No.  No.  You're traumatizing children.  It's like a hot air balloon shot.  Hey, but this ain't nephew.  This is a few years ago.  But this ain't nephew.  He just got caught by his girlfriend's father.  The upside down hot air balloon shot. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, my son's yelling at me now.  Anyway, I really like your show over there.  Yeah, everyone likes yours.  My new best friend.  He listens every afternoon.  That is so funny.  Is your son there with you right now?  No, he just went in the other room because he's by the radio.  I'm in the den.  Oh, yeah.  My husband's sleeping on the couch.  All right, we got to talk to Keith again.  Get him on the phone.  Okay, hang on.  Hey, sir, they want you.  Oh, my God.  Social services, please get over there and take those children. 
[00:08:00]  For God's sake.  We just got to keep them online for two more minutes.  We'll have the address.  Ella?  Hey, what's up?  Keith, did you hear what she was saying on the radio?  Yeah.  That's pretty embarrassing, huh?  Yeah, I guess so.  So your mom's like a big gal?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  It's a bit.  And your dad's pretty big.  Her ass looks like two pigs fighting over a milk dud.  Keith, you rule, man. 
[00:08:30]  That is funny.  Keith, we got to go drink beers with you, man.  Oh, man.  Do you know what your mom's favorite number is?  Oh, Keith, you getting in trouble?  Oh, now the motherly amount.  Are you getting in trouble, Keith?  Huh?  You getting in trouble?  No, my mom just said, they'll tell you where we live.  No, no.  Hey, so Keith. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah?  Your cousin saw your mom and dad having sex?  Oh, yeah.  What did he say about it?  Yeah, what did he say afterwards?  I don't know.  I was really young, but he had a horrific look on his face.  Oh, man.  That's pretty awful.  Yeah.  You know, you don't want to see that.  But guess what?  What?  Same kid dropped out of high school.  Well, that probably affected him.  He was traumatized.  Yeah.  How old is your mom?  She's around 46. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, and they're still going at it, huh?  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  It seems like you guys catch them having sex a lot, according to her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They try locking the door with the closet.  It doesn't work, huh?  Put a chair up against a doorknob.  Yeah.  They make these things called locks, Keith.  Yeah, really.  What about a lock?  My brother has one.  You ever walk in on him?  No.  All right, man.  Well, keep in touch.  I will.  I'd like to know what's happening in the wacky world to your parents. 
[00:10:00]  We're going to need updates, Keith.  All right.  They aren't smoking that wacky tobacco, are they?  I have no idea.  Yeah, you better say that.  Yeah.  Hey, Keith.  Yeah?  Do you have pubes yet?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  You always got to go there, man.  It's the bang on the head this morning.  I'm not thinking right.  Yeah.  All right, Keith.  All right.  Well, thanks for calling back.  We're having your mom call us, all right?  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  There you go. 
[00:10:30]  The Keith family.  The Keith family.  The Keith family.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for today.  We promised a bunch of people we'd replay that to start the show today.  They have a wacky, wacky family, those Keith's and Keith's moms and Keith's dads and walking  in on sex.  Everyone else.  You never saw your parents doing it, did you?  Hell no.  You ever hear your parents doing it?  Yeah, I've heard it.  You heard your parents having sex?  Not like my parents, but like my mom and stepfather. 
[00:11:00]  Which was like really bad.  Yeah, it was years ago.  Did you really hear them?  Yeah.  It was many years ago.  It was sound, you know.  Sound that's still with my mother like 20 years later.  They were both on the show yesterday.  Yeah, but like when they first got together, I guess they were doing it like rabbits, you  know.  And me, my brother and sister still living in the same house.  We're young. 
[00:11:30]  We're kids.  And there it was one night.  Like, oh, oh, it's disgusting.  Was it during the day?  Oh, you said in the middle of the night?  It was at night, yeah.  I'm just like, oh, man, who wants to hear this?  Did your mom have an O?  I wasn't listening for that.  I think I put my head under the pillow.  I know my brother was pissed because like the next day, Sal came to the door and my brother 
[00:12:00]  had a baseball bat and wouldn't let him in the house.  Like he was all pissed off.  It's like, then they got married and they're still together.  I think I heard Sal go, Roe, put a little nigga in it.  Come on, Roe.  He's from Baltimore, you know.  Come on, Roe.  Put a little nigger in it.  You can't say that.  Of course not.  All right.  You?  You're not getting off the hook.  You?  Ever hear it?  I don't know.  Have you ever the pleasure groans of your own mom? 
[00:12:30]  I think I heard something.  Oh.  Something about a pussy.  What?  That's all I want to say.  That's all I want to say today.  Holy Jesus.  Wait, wait.  You heard the P word for, you know, a cat or a different area come out of the room.  Was it in a man's voice or a woman's voice?  Uh, man's voice.  Oh, no.  Your father's doing some of that dirty talking.  Will you shut up?  My parents are listening today. 
[00:13:00]  So are mine.  They want us, they want to hear what we have to say about the Time article and everything  else.  Shut up.  That must have been some great dirty talk.  Yeah, I'm going to get that P.  I didn't say how it was used.  Well, you heard it.  He must have been saying it.  Shut up.  God, that is great.  Shut up.  Apusa.  Shut up, George.  Apusa.  Shut up, George Dick.  Apusa.  Apusa.  Apusa. 
[00:13:30]  Apusa.  Apusa.  Apusa.  Apusa.  Apusa.  Apusa.  Asuga.  Yeah, I've got to guarantee you right now.  I wasn't said like that.  Well, now that's all I can think of.  Ooh, wow.  Right.  Want to say hi to everybody?  Hey, we messed up all the phone numbers.  It's like the New York line is busy as heck, and the national number, no one's calling it. 
[00:14:00]  How did that happen?  Because we screwed it all up yesterday by adding a brand new phone number.  But it's the right number.  So I'm not even going to give out the New York number, because we don't have to.  Look at the phones.  They're going nuts here.  All right.  The national number to get a hold of us today, 866-277-4WOW.  Or you could dial 866-ASS-4WOW.  Same number.  PUSA!  I hope all the cities put that number on their websites and stuff, because it's getting a 
[00:14:30]  little confusing now, unfortunately.  And I apologize.  But if you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4WOW.  All right?  Right.  John, what's going on?  And I quote, to be quite frank, I think we're much funnier than he is.  Oh, Jesus.  I am so effed.  I am so effed.  Thanks, John.  Is this going to be another Time Magazine article?  I don't know what you're talking about, John.  Thank you.  Let's just put it this way. 
[00:15:00]  We're going to be on Fox News in New York tonight at 10 o'clock.  Fox News.  But knowing that they're not going to run until, like, 1055.  Well, they'll tease it.  And coming up, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Is that the promo they're running, one of our lines?  Yeah, the promo was you saying, yeah, I think we're much funnier or something like that.  Doesn't mean he doesn't do a good radio show, right?  Right. 
[00:15:30]  Okay.  Because I just got out of a meeting about this.  Oh, man.  Gee, was it another promo of me touching children or something of that sort?  I'm sure you're featured in the Fox News piece tonight, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  What'll it be?  Talking about the Olsen twins?  We'll go through the whole piece tomorrow on the show.  I think it's a whole feature.  They're doing, like, five or six minutes on us tonight.  Ah, poosah.  Fox News in New York, that's what, Channel 5 or whatever? 
[00:16:00]  I can't get that out of my head.  What?  What?  Ah, poosah.  Oh, what?  The audio clip of me from Fox News?  Of the anchor?  Anthony was featured last night?  I didn't know that.  What, was somebody talking about me on the news?  All right, they'll find the clip.  Oh, hold on.  Ah, your stepdad's on the line.  That's probably not Sal.  Sal?  Hey, guys, it's Sal, Anthony's stepdad.  Yes, I'm not listening to you. 
[00:16:30]  Anthony, you didn't hear your mom giving me the rusty trombone.  Oh, shut up.  I'm hanging up, Ant.  We can't have that.  We're not going there, friends.  No, no, no.  That's a bit you'll never hear.  I just thought it was the real Sal, Anthony.  No, he calls on the hotline.  Will, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  Hey, check this out.  One time, I was about 12, but 13.  I walked into my parents' bedroom.  They were having sex.  I walked in and out, and they didn't even see me.  My dad was up to see for like, I don't know, six months or so. 
[00:17:00]  Did you see the bobshot?  Did you see your father's bobshot, the back of the bees?  No, they were underneath the covers.  All I saw was the covers going up and down, up and down.  And I said, what the hell?  I walked in.  I grabbed like some gifts my dad had brought me, and I walked out of the room.  I was in there for like 30 seconds.  They didn't even see me.  That was messed up, bro.  And I was 13.  I'm 30 now.  I'll never forget that day.  Yeah, you don't want to ever see your parents having sex. 
[00:17:30]  That's all.  All right, now, you guys suck.  Thank you, man.  I had a moment with my grandma once.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You shouldn't really put it that way.  You had a moment with your grandma.  My dad was having some quadruple bypass surgery.  Yeah.  Piece of cake, little surgery thing.  Sure.  Up in where?  New Haven, right?  And we were visiting them at the hospital.  And then we're tooling up I-95.  It's me.  I think my sister.  My sister's husband, Mike. 
[00:18:00]  My brother.  Maybe my, um, another brother thrown in there.  My grandma.  We're just piled everyone in the car and we're going up I-95.  There's a car going really slow on the granny lane.  Yeah.  And we see this girl's head, swear to God, just going up and down, up and down, up and down.  My grandma took a peek.  Oh, no.  Turned to us and smiled.  She enjoyed the view.  She knew what that was?  Oh, hell yeah, she did.  Wow.  Maybe she was a goer back in the old Model T days in the car.  She was 85 at the time.  85.  And she gave us a smile because we're all laughing our asses off and we're thinking, you know, 
[00:18:30]  it's going to go right over grandma's head.  She knew about that stuff?  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  You didn't say anything though, right?  Um, one of my brothers, I'm sure, had a wise-ass remark.  Yeah.  Knowing that.  Yeah.  Oh.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, boys, what's happening?  Hey.  Hey, uh, where you guys had the road show last week.  There was a huge riot down there this weekend.  Yeah, I heard about that.  Sunfire the whole nine yards.  You should have seen 18,000 people. 
[00:19:00]  What a great little story that is.  We had a road show last week, uh, live from legendary Asbury Park.  That's where Bruce Springsteen got his start.  Asbury Park, New Jersey, right on the beach.  Used to be a booming entertainment complex back in the, uh, 40s.  You know?  A lot of people used to take their families there.  And, um, and now it looks like Beirut.  Now it looks just like Beirut.  I mean, we went to the Stone Pony, had a great time with our road show there.  They're really trying to get something going in that town. 
[00:19:30]  But it, it looks like Beirut.  There are broken down hotels.  The window's gone.  Everything's plywooded.  The roofs are caving in of these legendary landmark, uh, attractions that have just been ravaged by, uh, time.  And, um, it seems that this is a popular place for, uh, Greek Fest, Opie.  Do you know what Greek Fest is?  Uh, no.  Greek Fest.  Uh, they pop up, uh, all over the country, these things.  It's, it's for, uh, black college students to get together, um, and do the, uh, fraternity, sorority, party thing. 
[00:20:00]  Kind of blow off some steam.  Oh, it's kind of like Freak Nick.  Like Freak Nick.  Freak Nick.  Down in Hot Atlanta.  Freak Nick.  Freak Nick.  Got to tell everyone about Freak Nick.  Freak Nick.  Because when we got fired from Boston, we flew down to Atlanta for a little, uh, radio interview.  Mm-hmm.  And Freak Nick was just about to begin, and all the white people in town basically told us to leave town.  They get in here.  No joke.  We were leaving because we were flying back to New York. 
[00:20:30]  The airport's full of white people, like they're fleeing.  It looked like the evacuation from Saigon.  People waiting on the roofs for the choppers to take them off.  It's like Whitey just wanted out of Atlanta.  This is no joke.  We're not trying to be funny.  The locals, they board up their businesses, the storefronts.  And you could see...  Like a hurricane's coming.  Yeah.  And you could see chicks and guys driving in the cars up the main roads, and they just  stop in the middle of the street, blast music, get out and dance on the cars. 
[00:21:00]  And the girls all do that, uh, the booty dance, Opie.  I like big bucks.  They shake their ass in that round circle as they hold their hips right in front of them.  One of, uh, other, uh, uh, uh, like other guys.  It was quite lovely.  And they wait until they get a responsive guy, and then he goes up and starts humping  them.  I swear to God.  Like, she'll just get out, start doing the booty dance, shake that ass in those round  circles, grab the hips, look over her shoulder, and, and kind of dance around. 
[00:21:30]  And then a guy just comes up and starts humping her.  I like big bucks, and I cannot lie.  It's called Freak Nick.  Freak Nick.  So they do something similar down there in Asbury Park?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's called a Greek Fest.  And, um, the first one they had was a different part of the Jersey Shore, and it drew like 60,000  people, um, this year, 5,000 people who the police say are, um, not affiliated with, uh, 
[00:22:00]  black fraternities, sorority members, uh, probably not even affiliated with colleges.  It's just people hanging out.  And, uh, this year, 5,000 people, uh, 3,000 of those made their way into, um, like the beach  area, and just had running gunfights through the street.  It was like, I'm reading this story.  They're running, chasing each other, firing weapons.  They have, uh, uh, an SUV with the windows shot out, shooting an automatic weapon out 
[00:22:30]  the window at people.  There were carjackings where the, the gridlock got so bad because there were so many cars in  the area that the carjackers couldn't leave the parking lot they jacked the car from.  So they just drove in circles, shooting things from the stolen car.  Did anyone get killed or anything?  Uh, I, I don't know.  I know some people were seriously wounded.  They found one guy in the street with a bullet in his hip and his own 9mm gun on the street 
[00:23:00]  next to him.  Like, he'd just been dropped right there.  13-year-old girl, sexually assaulted, just stripped of her clothing.  Other women, uh, assaulted and mauled.  Yeah.  Yeah, the sounds of Asbury Park.  Oh, my God. 
[00:23:30]  People being robbed at gunpoint along Asbury Avenue and two brothers.  Two brothers in a, well, they were brothers.  Two brothers in a vehicle with Hawaiian license plates were carjacked.  Boy, that's being lost.  How we get here? 
[00:24:00]  Witnessed a group of teen boys stripping the clothes from a 13-year-old girl.  Seven women reported they've been groped.  Armed robberies at any of the stores that are open.  And they pulled over a car and found hollow point bullets in the back seat.  I mean, it's like they just went there to shoot each other.  To have this running gun battle.  In all fairness, it shouldn't be called Greek Fest.  Said this deputy from the police department. 
[00:24:30]  Other mayors say that...  You got knocked the f*** out!  And they said there weren't as many cops on duty because in previous years, the police have been told by the party goers that there's too big a police presence.  And they don't want them cracking down on their fun.  Well, this is what happens when you pull some of the cops off of there.  Vinny!  Hello, Vinny.  What's up, Vinny?  You know, I just called to give you guys the facts. 
[00:25:00]  And here they are.  Oh, it's Vinny the Racist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Black males, age 16 to 35, 4% of the population.  Yet, Anthony, check this out.  They're committing over 50% of the crime.  Come on!  Really, Vinny the Racist?  Where do you get your information from?  What?  Anthony, there's a fact.  He's running the 1999 FBI crime report.  You got the computer right there, Anthony.  Do you subscribe to that?  Yes, I do. 
[00:25:30]  You're out of your mind, Vinny.  Well, Vinny, perhaps that statistic is because of oppression.  See you, old buddy!  Perhaps it's because of oppression, Vinny.  Oh, Vinny.  I know, you know, look, I'm giving you the facts.  You can look it up.  All right, well, we'll all look them up.  FBI crime reports, 1999, 4% of the population, 60% of the crime.  Vinny, what do you say we do?  How do we fix this, then?  Well, I don't think there's any cure now.  I think it's got too far.  I mean, we had a chance a couple years ago when Papua Cannon was running. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, more funny!  Cut that out, man.  All right, we're going to go to FBI.com and look up your facts.  Yeah, look it up, Austin.  Come on.  You know, I ain't going to look it up.  Here he goes.  Vinny, always going off.  Tuttle checking and saying, hey, didn't all that happen at the road show?  I know, when I saw the news article, I thought they were writing about the road show at first.  Yeah, because it says, mayhem follows festival in Asbury Park. 
[00:26:30]  I'm like, oh, God, what happened?  Right.  What did we do?  It talks about guys getting arrested for being drunk and naked.  I don't know.  It starts off a little like it might have been one of our road shows.  By early yesterday, police were collecting hundreds, hundreds of bullet casings strewn across several city blocks,  blood-stained sidewalks, turned upside down downtown supermarket,  where a 24-year-old city man was shot three times by an off-duty narcotics detective. 
[00:27:00]  The man fired his .357 magnum into the crowd, then pointed it at the detective.  Brian's a Jersey cop.  Brian.  Maybe he's not.  There were reported gunshots all over, and apparently there were some running gun battles.  People just running through the streets shooting each other.  At least five people were robbed at gunpoint.  Now there's a party. 
[00:27:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Let me try this again.  All right.  Here we go.  Brian.  Yo.  Hold on.  Brian.  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  What's happening?  That off-duty detective actually shot two cops that were on indictment, actually.  They were the ones going around shooting up the streets.  Get out of here.  Yeah, man.  They were on indictment for a narcotics distribution. 
[00:28:00]  Two Perth and Boy cops.  I didn't hear about that.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's not an R-Raz story there.  Yeah.  Well, when you're indicted for stuff, I guess you could just go out and shoot the streets  up and have fun.  Why not?  Yeah, why not, right?  Have some fun with it.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  All right, dude.  All right.  There he goes, Brian.  We should take our first break.  We're just getting started, right?  Listen in critical condition with bullet wounds to his face and neck.  All right.  Greetings from Hatchbury Park. 
[00:28:30]  Hi, this is Bruce Springsteen.  Holy jeez, I'm getting out of here.  Greetings from Hatchbury Park. 
[00:29:00]  Hatchbury Park. 
[00:29:30]  That man makes a move, the nigger gets it. 
[00:30:00]  You got locked the f**k up.  All right.  Hey, Rick, is the Richard Jennings thing just about ready?  It's ready.  I don't know.  How uncomfortable is that?  We got some cringe radio on the way.  Richard Jennings came in, and we really messed with him really bad.  I didn't realize how bad it was.  It was fortunate.  It's brutal to listen to.  We'll play a little taste of that next. 
[00:30:30]  As we go to break, something from the archives, okay?  A call that went horribly wrong.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  Oi.  This is FM Talk 1027.  We are having an absolute riot today.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities.  Yeah, sure.  Hoping a lot of people are joining the Tuesday Night Hummer Club right now, Ant.  I would hope so, too.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right.  I'm in the middle of being inducted into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, as we speak.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at Seaside Heights.  Are you on the road?  Oh, no.  I can't do that right now, at least.  No?  No, no.  I'm at home.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that, though.  Let's talk to the lady real fast.  Okay, here.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Are you really inducting your boyfriend into the club tonight?  Yeah, I sure am.  All right.  Hey, real quick.  Lick the mouthpiece on the phone.  Go ahead, real quick.  Oh, God.  Go ahead.  Now give him back the phone.  Oh, no, no, no.  Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah? 
[00:31:30]  What's your name?  Kelly.  Kelly?  Yeah.  Can he hear us right now?  No.  Okay, listen.  Kelly.  Yeah?  We will give you a really good prize.  He can't hear, right?  No.  All right.  I want you to give him back the phone and go back into inducting him and just give him  a little bite.  Okay.  I'm serious.  If he screams, we're going to give you a really good prize.  All right?  All right.  Not enough to really cause, you know, severe damage, but enough to get a reaction, okay?  All right.  All right.  Let's put Jeff on the line again.  Okay.  What the hell was that? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, s***.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I had to jump back.  Don't curse.  Sorry about that.  She spit him.  Jeff, what's wrong?  Oh, man.  She bit me.  She bit me.  She bit hard, but...  God damn, Opie, that's bad. 
[00:32:30]  Isn't it a beautiful thing he's getting a kiss and made better now?  Man, that's not right, Opie.  She went right for it, though.  That's not bad.  That's real funny.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  And I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless. 
[00:33:00]  Gracie.  Hey, pictures.  Look at that.  Anthony, diamond vision.  I think we're on the air.  Diamond vision.  When you choose a LASIK surgeon, you want experienced specialists, not someone who's impersonal  high-volume assembly line.  No.  Remember, it's not quantity that matters.  It's quality.  That's why professional athletes like Tiki Barber have chosen diamond vision.  And Opie's chosen diamond vision.  Dr.  Philitop does it.  Harvard trained, board certified. 
[00:33:30]  This guy's a pro.  He's done thousands of these.  Here's the best part.  Diamond vision is proud to make LASIK affordable with prices starting at just $499 per eye through  July.  That's $499 per eyeball.  Call them up now for a free consultation in Manhattan, Scarsdale, Greenwich, or Westport.  1-800-984-2020.  Easy number.  1-800-984-2020.

[00:34:00]  Not your everyday, everyday.  On Bravo.  Meek, crap.  Opie and Anthony.  102.7.  WNEW.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Days of the new.  Little case.  Enemy.  Nice move by Travis Meeks.  He gets rid of his band and they turn around and form Tantric.  Oops.  Ouch.  Look what I did to you now.  Look what I did to you again. 
[00:34:30]  Lee, what's going on?  Hey, Lee.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Let's go.  Let's go.  We're a fast-paced radio show.  I'm sorry?  Oh.  What's your story?  Okay.  One time I was with my boyfriend and we got into a really, really bad argument.  And then he decided that it would be a good idea to have makeup sex to make it better.  Makeup sex, huh?  Yeah.  And he said the makeup sex always is the best sex to have. 
[00:35:00]  Makeup sex could be really, really good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Please hold.  Please hold.  Hold on.  We're professionals.  You can't say that on the radio.  Just said went to administer the Hummer.  Right.  You went in for the Hummer and then what did you do?  Well, I bit him so hard that he, I swear he screamed like a 12-year-old girl with a skin  knee and we were at college and we had to take him to the health center. 
[00:35:30]  Why?  Did you draw blood?  No.  He got a really nice bruise though.  Did you pinch a piece with your teeth or did you just bite down on a meaty part?  I bit down on the, right at the top.  Right at the top.  Yes.  Yes.  The sensitive area.  Great job.  The problem I have with this call, it says on the screen that you thought it was funny.  What?  Ouch. 
[00:36:00]  Ouch.  I was justified.  Ouch.  Cute story.  Thanks, Lee.  I don't like those stories.  Yeah.  Ladies don't get any wise ideas like that.  Dominic, what's going on?  Dominic.  Hello.  Hello.  The owner of the Stone Pony.  What happened?  We were talking about Asbury Park and he said, I demand to speak to Opie and Anthony.  So there we had it. 
[00:36:30]  Maybe.  Is he calling back?  Dominic.  Hello.  No, that's not Dominic.  Who's this?  Hello?  Hello?  Dominic, mine too.  Ah.  Hey.  Dominic, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  The owner of the Stone Pony, it says on the screen, you demand to talk to us.  Yep, I demand to talk to you.  Great sound effects about the last riots here this weekend.  I'll tell you, Asbury Park was giving us a lot of heat for your show, for all the lewdness 
[00:37:00]  and everything that happened.  Really?  Uh, and this goes to show them that the Opie and Anthony show was nothing compared to what  their sanctioned events could be.  So what was it like?  It was pretty bad.  I had people coming up to my lawn, because I live a block away.  I just bought a house, and for breakfast, my daughters say, there's someone with a big  black worm pissing on our window.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[00:37:30]  Dominic, you can't say that word.  Yeah, the, uh, there was, there was, uh, Anthony, why don't you clean that up?  Well, there was somebody, uh, um, um, defecating, liquid, liquid defecation.  Um, on my, uh, while we were having breakfast.  You're eating breakfast, all of a sudden.  My daughter, that's 10 years old, turns around and says there's someone, you know.  Is, uh, uh, taking a leak on your window as you're having breakfast. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  How did she, how did she describe what was...  It was a worm.  She says they have a worm that's, there's liquid coming out of a big black worm.  Oh, my God.  So, basically, that was my morning rude awakening.  Uh, and then, basically, I had to just patrol the corner and just make sure that the property  wasn't damaged or any of that.  Hey, Dominic, a little, a little advice from your pals, Opie and Anthony.  Get out! 
[00:38:30]  No.  No, this is a great time.  This is a great town, guys.  This is, you know, you have to believe in it, and this is a great...  Asbury Park is on the, uh, comeback.  This, just, what you see here is, like you said, is Beirut by the shore.  It's 14 years of a failed development, but that's, uh, we have a new city council, and  they're doing a great job cleaning it up.  Yeah.  Those sound effects that you guys did were great.  I'll go on record and say you got a great club at the end. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  The area around there has to be, uh, you know, revitalized.  Yeah, but, you know, that's what it takes.  It takes people to believe in the area and to come in and put your money where your mouth is.  Sarajevo's on the comeback trail, too, you know.  Yeah.  But, uh, a lot of us will not see the day when there's, uh, nice buildings again.  Saigon.  Saigon.  That took 30 years.  But listen, that's what attracted me.  It's surreal.  It's magical.  All we needed was, like, tumbleweeds in this city. 
[00:39:30]  A year ago, there was nobody.  Nothing walking on the street.  Now we have people.  Now you're bringing your show.  You're packing the place.  And there's people here.  But, Dominic, you got, uh, black worms being pressed up against your window while you're eating breakfast with your little kid.  Hey, that's life.  So on.  You know, life goes on.  I move on.  You know, it's...  I'm still alive.  More power to you.  Yeah, without a doubt.  All right.  Well, thank you, Dominic.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:40:00]  The owner of the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.  I got a revitalizing plan for, um, Asbury Park.  Leonola Gay, with her deadly cargo in her belly, leaves the airfield.  Bound for Asbury Park, where, uh, atomic bomb will be dropped.  Clearing the way for new development.  She rolls down the tarmac.  I mean, please.  He's a brave guy.  Yeah, without a doubt.  I mean, and let me tell you something. 
[00:40:30]  If I'm sitting there, and you got a daughter like that, and some, uh, guy whips out his junk in plain view and starts taking a leak on your window, you should be able to shoot him.  It's a black worm, Anthony.  A big black worm is squirting on the window, Daddy.  When you hear that, get to the root cellar.  Get to the root cellar.  And get your gun.  You get your big black gun.  Because, I'll tell you something.  You don't know if that big black worm is going to come through your window and invade your daughter. 
[00:41:00]  Like Godzilla.  Take your daughter away.  It could.  Who wants that happening?  Black worm wraps itself around your daughter's neck and pulls her right through the window there.  Pulls her out.  Alexandria. 
[00:41:30]  Alexandria.  Hey.  Hey.  I got the one thing worse than catching your parents.  What?  Catching your grandparents.  Oh!  You caught your grandparents having sex?  Yes.  I grew up with my grandparents.  I wasn't raised by my regular parents.  What kind of sex were they having?  I think it was like my mom was, my grandmother was like straddled my grandfather.  Like, oh, she's a top girl?  Yeah.  Nice.  And my grandparents are like in their 60s.  I think all, at that age, all ladies have to be top. 
[00:42:00]  Don't bounce too much, Grandma.  I might break a hip.  You can't, you can't have Grandpa, you know, on top.  I'd say I saw them once, but I heard them every Sunday morning on the morning.  Like laying on a gummy sack full of potatoes.  I'm having sex and, uh, click clacks are hitting me in the bush.  Oh, God.  Well, that's a great story, Alexandria.  Thank you.  You guys suck.  All right.  Bye.  Grandparents.  With Grandma on top.  That's nice.  That's a hot grandma. 
[00:42:30]  All right, we have the Richard Jenny, uncomfortable, oof, radio clip here.  You want to explain the Richard Jenny thing, Anthony?  Well, he's a comedian that has been on, um, oh, my God, just about every talk show you  can think of.  Yeah.  Pretty famous guy.  Sure.  Sure.  He was on, uh, Ron and Fez's show, I guess, uh, before us here in New York.  And, uh, Ron came in, asked us, why haven't we, haven't we had Richard Jenny on our show?  I'm like, you know, we really don't have much to say to Richard Jenny. 
[00:43:00]  It wasn't like the name all of a sudden goes, oh, yeah, let's get him.  You know, nice enough guy and all, but I don't know if he really would fit into this, um, program.  Right.  But he called up.  And then he wound up coming down.  And, um, we gave him a really, really hard time.  We, uh, wouldn't let him in the studio first.  We made him call from right outside the door.  Of the studio.  Yeah, what you're about to hear.  Good bad.  Is, uh, us talking to Richard Jenny on the phone, even though he's probably 12 feet away 
[00:43:30]  from us.  At one point he looked in the window so we could see him.  It was like a prison visit.  Right.  We beat him up really bad.  Yeah.  And here's a guy that's been on Leno and Letterman and everyone else.  Here's a guy.  So let's go to the tape.  It's, uh, us with Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny's out there?  Yep.  Yeah, get him on the phone.  All right.  Richard Jenny's, uh, a comedian.  Called up yesterday.  Yes, he did.  At the end of the show.  Wanted to, uh, come in.  Mm-hmm.  Plug his, uh, show. 
[00:44:00]  Caroline's.  And, uh, for some reason he kept getting disconnected.  Right.  And, uh, we invited him to come in today.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello.  Who's this?  Richard Jenny.  Who's this?  Richard Jenny.  Hey, uh, Richard.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good?  I'm just peachy.  Thanks.  Uh, when are you coming in?  I was thinking about coming in, uh, today.  Today?  Yeah.  At what time? 
[00:44:30]  Probably about, uh, 440.  440?  It's what?  422?  Yeah, I'm, I'm really close by.  Where are you?  I'm actually staying in the lobby.  You're outside the studio?  Yeah, I've been, I've been staying in the lobby.  I didn't want to miss you guys.  Hmm.  And you want to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  If it's okay, if you're not too busy talking about Ron Jeremy's, uh, penis, I could maybe  stop in.  Well, Ron's coming in, too.  You get along with him?  Yeah, you said yesterday, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yes, I've met him before.  In fact, I used to do jokes about him in my head.  I used to do a joke about big, hairy, fat guys with hair on their back getting, getting  all kinds of chicks, and he came up to me.  I did the porno awards.  That's how I met him.  Oh, really?  I had a bit in there about fat, hairy guys getting all kinds of women.  He comes up to me, he goes, you're talking about me, weren't you?  And I go, no, no, it's just a generic fat, porno, hairy guy.  It wasn't really you.  When you tell that joke on stage, do you get a laugh?  That wasn't actually the form.  It was just telling a story. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, I thought, oh, I thought you said that's something you do in your act.  Do you want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  Well, that's where you're on the phone like you are now, and then you step up to the glass  on the door to the studio.  Right.  And you talk that way?  No, I'm not doing that.  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  You ever watch Oz?  Why can't I just come in?  I can't just come in the studio. 
[00:46:00]  Are you worried about germs or something?  Oh, we're going to have Ron Jeremy in.  That was really funny, that thing yesterday was really funny.  What thing?  The thing where you kept hanging up on it.  Oh, yeah.  It would be funny if we hung up on you right now.  No, I think it gets old.  It gets old after a while.  Yeah, it does.  This is our new game.  You're 15 feet away, and we're making you call us on the telephone.  At first, I was pissed off, and then I just started cracking up.  We were so juvenile.  Were you really mad?  At first, I was.  What the hell was that? 
[00:46:30]  How could they do it?  And then I just go, that is just so asinine.  I have to laugh at it.  But if you're going to get mad at something like that, maybe you shouldn't be on our show,  because we're juvenile.  That's true.  You know?  Well, it's up to you.  I was hoping you'd put me on.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny.  Well, I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure on you or anything.  I'll be funny.  Like, what's the first joke you're going to tell on the air?  Stop it.  You're totally putting him on the spot here. 
[00:47:00]  Do you have a riff on, like, Clinton or anything?  Clinton.  Any riffs on things in the news?  There's lots of riffs on whatever you want to talk about.  Yeah?  But I've got to be in the studio to do it.  I'm not funny in the lobby.  Yeah.  So you got any knock-knock jokes?  He's laughing at the juvenile stuff again.  Knock-knock.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Um, uh-oh. 
[00:47:30]  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny.  Who?  Richard Jenny, you're hearing knock-knock because I'm pistol-whipping Opie and Anthony.  Get it?  Richard Jenny, who?  Oh, sorry.  All right, Richard.  Can you give us a few minutes to think about it?  Yeah, think it over.  Opie, you are just the worst host ever.  All right, hold on, Richard. 
[00:48:00]  Someone wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Paul.  What's up, boys?  You're on the air with Richard Jenny, who's right outside the studio on a phone.  Yeah, do yourself a huge favor and leave him where he is.  Why?  Why?  He was on Ron and Fez yesterday, and I felt like sticking a steak knife in my forehead.  Oh.  Richard?  He was more boring than church.  Richard, did you have a good time on Ron and Fez yesterday?  Yeah, I did.  But actually, I feel like sticking a steak knife in his forehead, too. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, he was horrendous.  He was horrendous.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  That's not nice, Paul.  Richard Jenny came all this way.  He's in the lobby, outside the studio.  Right, Richard?  In the lobby.  Not for much longer.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean?  Wait a minute, Richard.  I thought you know how to have fun and stuff.  Come on.  You're wearing me out with this crap.  We're just having fun and hanging.  All right. 
[00:49:00]  You're not having fun with this?  It's funny for like a minute.  Yeah, but you know, some things are funny, right?  And then they get unfunny.  And then the longer they go on, it comes right back around and gets funny again.  Yeah, I guess.  We're waiting for it to get to that point again.  All right.  It's really not there yet.  We'll have a long wait.  Richard, do you know what our show's about?  You ever hear our show?  What have you heard about the O.P. and Anthony show, Richard?  Nothing.  Not much?  Nothing?  No. 
[00:49:30]  Are you from New York, or where are you from?  Originally from New York, there.  And where you live in L.A. now?  Yeah.  So you're not familiar with this show?  No, but it's so popular.  So this could be like Commonplace, and you wouldn't know it.  We might do this to every guest we've ever had.  Are we on the air right now?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  What?  You thought this wasn't on the air? 
[00:50:00]  No, I thought we were just talking.  We are.  It's a talk show, kind of.  All right.  I'm going to hang it up.  All right.  What?  Hello?  Why did he hang up?  Did he hang up?  What's going on?  Rick, go see how that went.  He's right outside the door.  What's the matter?  But we were having fun.  Why is there a look coming in here?  What's up, stinky?  Stinky, what's wrong?  Nothing, nothing.  I don't fear for my life.  Is he okay? 
[00:50:30]  Pacing a little.  Rick, go smooth things over, Rick.  Rick, you're the producer.  Take care of things.  No, we're going to go to the listeners and see if they want Richard Jenny on the show.  There he is.  He looks like he's going to kill us.  Richard Jenny.  Come here.  Sit down, man.  Are you doing this or not?  Oh, no.  Come on.  It's all fun.  Richard Jenny, how are you?  Aren't you a good sport, Richard?  That's Opie over there.  I'm Anthony.  Uh-oh, he looks all uptight.  What's the matter?  You spend too much time.  You're wasting time, right? 
[00:51:00]  It's like a waste of time.  See, now you've got to be funny.  No.  After we just pissed you off.  He looks all pissed.  Here, get on the mic.  Just let's see how much we can screw with Rick and Rick.  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  For sure.  That was a joke.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  I get it.  Richard, let me explain something.  Look at two little babies. 
[00:51:30]  He's going to conform to our show.  Don't say...  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to be more funny.  Don't say two, because Opie is...  Press button, you big loser.  Press button.  Be more funny.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us, and we can't take it.  I was listening, and Opie is a prick to guess.  You don't have a sense of humor?  Just a little taste.  It goes on forever, but...  He was doing the typical comedy thing.  Hey, recently I was on a flight, and... 
[00:52:00]  Uh-oh, here comes the joke.  Here comes the joke.  That just shut him right down.  You know, let me tell you, recently, you know, I've been flying to...  Here comes the funny.  Here comes the funny.  Show me the funny.  All right.  We must take a break.  Yeah.  Is Jim Brewer coming in today?  That's what the fact says.  Hey, Hammer.  Brewer should be coming in today.  Paul Mercurio from The Daily Show on Comedy Central stopping by.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to have the hot mom that was kicked out of the Big Brother house. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Why not?  We wanted to get the executive producer on, Arnold Shapiro.  Yeah.  Tell him how much of a loser he is for kicking Justin out of the house.  Yeah, we said that when it happened.  I mean, you'd need interesting people in there like that.  You're looking for ratings.  You had him in the palm of your hand, and you decided to chicken out and kick him out  of the house.  What a...  Line 11.  We'll get to line 11 in just a bit, okay?  Yeah.

[00:54:30]  Give us a call.  866-277-4.  Wow.  That song rocks.  For the New York audience, we're being featured on the 10 o'clock news tonight on Fox, Channel  5.  Fox 5, 10 o'clock news.  The fine folks at Fox, I'm sure they're going to just make us look stupid like everyone else  does.  Right.  But they put the piece together in such a way that maybe the national affiliates, yeah, 
[00:55:00]  will pick up the story as well.  Oh, well, there you go.  Who knows?  If someone in another city sees it tonight, let us know.  They'll definitely be on in New York, though.  Oh, boy.  I won't watch.  Christy, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, nothing.  How you doing?  I'm fine.  All right.  You've been on hold for about 45 minutes. 
[00:55:30]  What do you got for the show?  Oh, about last night's show.  Yeah.  That was my last night.  Yeah.  Oh, you're calling from Dallas.  Yeah.  Dallas, Texas.  All right.  What's up?  Oh, nothing.  You were listening to last night's show?  Yeah.  And?  That was, like, dumb.  The show was dumb?  No.  The Time magazine thing was dumb.  Oh, the Time article?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all right, though.  That's what they do.  They're not going to write anything positive about us.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  How old the gal are you?  I'm just happy we're in Time magazine.  She's 18, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Christy.  Uh-huh.  Did you pick up the Time magazine to check out the article?  No.  Oh, all right.  Not yet.  Well, she got that little accent going.  Yeah.  So, what do you do, Christy?  Um, nothing.  Nothing at all?  Nope.  You go to school?  Yeah.  Oh.  What grade are you in?  I'm not going to tell you that.  What?  I'm not going to tell you what grade I'm in.  Well, you've got to be either in 11th grade or 13th grade or 12th grade or you're going 
[00:56:30]  to community college.  What are you doing?  What?  Oh, Christy, I've got to let you go.  No.  No, no, no.  Huh?  No.  No, no, no.  You should be doing that homeschooling.  I'm doing homeschooling.  There's Christy from Dallas.  Damn you concrete walkers.  I don't like your kind.  You're shitty people. 
[00:57:00]  I love that tape.  Yeah.  How was Spinal Tap last night, Anthony?  Oh, rock.  Yeah?  Yeah, I had a lot of fun, man.  Spinal Tap.  I saw him last night at the Beacon.  I had a star-studded audience, Opie.  A lot of people were there?  Star-studded.  Was it the place to be last night?  It seemed to be the place to be, yes.  For the likes of Penn from Penn and Teller.  The guy from Will and Grace. 
[00:57:30]  Will from Will and Grace.  Is he the gay guy?  He's one of the gay guys on the show, but I think he overcomes it out in public by just  always being wrapped around his hot wife, girlfriend, whatever she is.  It's hysterical.  Yes, I'm gay on the show, but look.  I'm going to have a girl right here in front of you just to prove I'm not.  That's going to suck that you're the gay guy.  And I hit sitcom if you're not gay.  Because, you know, the gay guys just probably come up to him all the time.  I just love you.  Get out of here, faggot. 
[00:58:00]  Christy's back.  Hold on a minute.  Christy.  Why'd you hang up on me?  Because you had nothing to say.  Aw.  All right, we'll give you a chance to say something.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Is this going to be on tonight?  Yeah.  Dallas?  Yeah, you'll be on in Dallas.  Dallas.  Sounding really stupid.  Cut this out.  All right, go ahead.  Say something.  I was on hold, like, forever.  And then you guys just...  Oh, oh. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, you're heartless.  I'm going for five today.  You're going to go for five with her?  She'll call back.  I say she calls back five times.  Anyway, spinal time.  Christy, what the hell's this phone bill all about?  Mama.  So you ran into the gay guy from Will and Grace, but he's not gay.  I didn't run into him, Opie.  The way you make it sound, like I ran into him.  But he's not gay because he was with his hot wife or girlfriend or something, and he  made sure everyone was checking him out when he was with his hot wife or girlfriend.  Right.  Okay.  Making sure.  I got it.  And I think he was trying to be a little bit of a tough guy in front of his girlfriend. 
[00:59:00]  A little tough guy.  What, slapping around a little bit?  No, that would have worked, though.  That works, too.  No, he's sitting in his seat, watching Spinal Tap, and his chick is on the aisle seat.  Right.  And he's next to her.  And some people were walking in the aisle, and his girl couldn't see.  So he kind of leans over.  His girlfriend taps the guy and goes, hey, she can't see.  And the guy just turns around and goes, shut up, faggot.  He did not.  No, he moved.  But shut up, faggot. 
[00:59:30]  But, and then at one point they got up, and right before he sat down, someone threw a  drink in his chair.  So he sat, and his ass got wet, just like a real gay guy.  Come on.  Gay guy's sitting in seats that people have dumped water on or something.  Anthony, we're on in San Francisco now.  Cut it out.  We've got to make a good impression for everyone listening in San Francisco.  Welcome, we welcome everyone.  That's a winner.  We welcome everybody. 
[01:00:00]  So what else happened at Spinal Tap?  Oh, we got a clip of somebody talking to the guy from Will and Grace.  Freaking fag.  You want to make out or something?  That's horrible.  That's not him.  So is Penn the one that talks or doesn't talk?  The big one.  Yeah.  The big guy that talks.  He was there.  Also, Stephen Van Zandt from, of course, Miami Steve.  E Street Band.  And The Sopranos.  The Sopranos.  Now, everybody knows.  More people are coming up to him asking him about taking pictures with him because they 
[01:00:30]  know him from The Sopranos than from Springsteen.  And then he's talking to me about he wants a show on WNW here in New York.  He wants to do a what?  A talk show?  No.  He wants to do like a garage rock show.  Because we already have the Eddie Trunk show there on Saturday night.  And he does a good job with that.  No.  It would be like, you know, something on the weekend where he would do something.  I'm like, all right, you know, I'll talk to Ken Stevens for you. 
[01:01:00]  Bada bing.  I'm just like, hey, he was pitching you a rock show.  I do you a favor.  Maybe you do me a favor.  Bada bing.  Does he understand we don't really play music anymore on the radio station?  That's something I don't know.  See?  Yeah.  No, I think he knows that, but I think he was pitching some kind of weekend show.  All right.  Yeah.  And Spinal Tap rocked.  You know, they did all the hits, but they were kind of, I'm sorry, they're kind of dicks.  They really are.  Well, yeah, they blew us off yesterday. 
[01:01:30]  They blew everyone off.  Everybody.  It's just amazing, because we presented the Spinal Tap show.  Opie and Anthony present.  Says it on the ticket.  We're concert promoters as well in our spare time.  Yeah, for some reason.  I don't know what that entails.  We have presented Andrew Dice Clay in the past, and now Spinal Tap.  So, uh...  At the garden!  You would think if we're going to help them sell tickets for their show, because it wasn't sold out, right, Ant?  Yeah.  They would, uh, I don't know, maybe, you know, come down to the station and, uh, you know, hang on our show. 
[01:02:00]  They blew us off.  Yeah.  Totally blew us off.  And, um...  And I heard they were kind of dicks to their fans and backstage last night, huh?  We're hanging out backstage, and it was hard enough for me to get a pass.  I got one pass.  And, uh, for me and my girlfriend.  And that was it.  I had my brother Joe, uh, Cowbell Bill hanging out, uh, Big Kev, Joe Curry.  Everyone I went with had to sit out there, and then I got my messages on the phone later. 
[01:02:30]  Dude, man, I guess you couldn't get us in and stuff, but, you know, it's cool.  I enjoyed the show.  So I'm the, uh, I'm the dick.  I'm the bad guy.  Now I'm the bad guy.  You need a person like me.  You need me.  I'm the bad guy.  You gotta take care of your entourage, Anthony.  Well, I didn't see anybody.  I saw fleeting glimpses of people, uh, that were in Spinal Tap.  The Anthony entourage.  My entourage.  My peeps.  I'm like P. Diddy.  I'm P. Diddy.  I'm P. Diddy.  P. Diddy. 
[01:03:00]  So I, I, I go back there.  I, I barely see Spinal Tap.  You know, the guys.  Mm-hmm.  Um, they leave through the back door to go to their limos.  There's people waiting outside for autographs.  Not a lot of people.  But there's, like, guys went out there for some autographs with some Spinal Tap memorabilia.  Nothing.  They walked right past them.  Right past them.  Maybe they were, you know, trying to be rock stars.  Hey, look.  You know, you're taking your Spinal Tap thing a little too friggin' seriously.  Uh, it was a goof band, a movie back in, uh, like 1982, 83.  Maybe they're gay. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe they're gay.  Hey, faggot.  Maybe they're...  Nice head, dicks.  Where you going?  You two big now, faggots?  You sucked on SNL, dick!  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Jim Brewer.  I'm gay for you, faggot!  Were you on SNL during the time any of them were on?  No.  No?  No?  Yeah, they missed each other.  Right, right.  Really?  Michael McCann wasn't on, like, part-time thing?  He was on for, what, a season?  Yeah, I know. 
[01:04:00]  All those guys are.  They were on for, like, ten minutes.  Yeah, Christopher Gass.  The only one that was on, uh, a short amount of time was Anthony Michael Hall.  Oh, God!  Do you remember that?  Oh, yeah.  The Anthony Michael Hall month.  Wasn't that Julia Dreyfuss, too?  Yeah, yeah, she was on, sure.  Michael Anthony was on a tear, too.  I mean, he kind of had the gayish geek thing going, but you loved him.  Because he got high in that movie.  He had that growth spurt, and it was all over.  And then all of a sudden, it was like, what happened?  Now I think he's in that...  I think he's in that movie, that Def Leppard VH1 production. 
[01:04:30]  What?  Who's he playing?  I don't know who he's playing, but he's definitely in the, uh, the Def Leppard movie.  Yeah, he's playing the drummer's leg.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Def Leppard movie, tomorrow night, in the VH1.  Def Leppard made a movie?  It's a VH1 movie.  It's a VH1 movie, like, uh, they cast...  Did they cast it in, or...?  No, no, it's not them.  They cast people as Def Leppard, which is hysteric.  Where did they get the one-armed actor from?  I have no idea.  Arm, leg, whatever.  Arm?  No, I know. 
[01:05:00]  But who cares?  I know my amputees.  Arm, leg, whatever.  I know my amputees.  So, I saw some dramatic moments of him in the hospital, you know, and the fake Def Leppard  talking to him, you know, trying to act like Def Leppard.  We're still gonna be a band.  Yeah, stuff like that.  We're still gonna rock it.  We're still gonna be a band.  We're not giving up on Def Leppard.  No.  We're gonna still be a band.  Photograph will live on.  We'll be back with more of the Def Leppard story on VH1. 
[01:05:30]  Photograph!  So, back to Spinal Tap.  Back in!  Back in!  Back in!  What are you doing?  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  How annoyed must the rumors that I was going to be?  Food, shut up, bitch, shut up!  Yeah, here we go.  VH1 Behind the Music presents Jeff Leppard.  But not really Jeff Leppard in the Not Really Jeff Leppard story. 
[01:06:00]  And the guy with the missing arm, but he's not really missing at all.  How did they do that?  We'll show you on Behind the Jeff Leppard movie.  Behind the Music.  See how they struggled on to perform songs like Love Bites.  Love Bites.  When you need that.  Pour some sugar on me and rock it.  Yeah.  Watch how they were gang raped by five black rappers after a concert one day. 
[01:06:30]  It still survived.  Make your own British flag shorts.  Just like the drummer.  The movie Hysteria.  Jeff Leppard.  Starring people that kind of look like Jeff Leppard.  I'm there.  I'm there.  That says watch me.  How cheesy was the blonde guy?  Remember the blonde guy?  They all were blonde, no?  Tight pants.  No, no, no.  The short blonde hair guy.  Hey, and then the guy died.  Wait a minute.  The one long hair guy died. 
[01:07:00]  Did he shoot himself or something?  No, he got like so effed up all the time on booze and drugs.  Oh, that's got to be a great part of the movie too.  Oh, bandmates dead, but the band's got to go on.  We're missing a leg in a play of a fucking single of Bites.  Oh, me gone, me foot fell off, but we could still be a band.  See Jeff Leppard as they transform into a band of nothing but heads.  Heads.  Singing heads.  My body rotted off, but we're still a band. 
[01:07:30]  We've got to keep Jeff Leppard together.  Singing heads.  They're bringing their heads out.  Shut up.  They're bringing them out.  We're going to see.  Look, it's the head.  So put them on the stool, man.  A story of courage and bravery.  As Jeff Leppard is just heads.  Jeff heads.  I had to learn how to play the guitar all over again when I was just a head.  It's hard to re- I had to re-teach myself guitar. 
[01:08:00]  Of course, I had to play with me tongue.  With special gift, Ozzy Osbourne.  As he comes in and crams one head and bites it in half.  And then shoves the other half in his pooper.  Well, it's quite well.  I was just a head.  I figured we would snort some lines.  It's just a head that cocaine came right out of the neck.  I think I'm basically saying it is this myself.  See the story of courage.  Bravery. 
[01:08:30]  A story no one gives a flying F about.  Jeff Leppard.  In torso rock.  See they're choking on their own vomit stories.  Jeff Leppard hysteria.  I don't know what they're saying either. 
[01:09:00]  It was great.  We're all still buds from long ago.  And no matter how many body parts fall off, we got to keep the band together.  We were abused.  I remember one time we went out with Metallica and they used our heads for kickballs.  It was not funny.  Lars got real drunk and he ordained it on my wife.  I remember one time the bass player, he's still just a head, decided to take a drive. 
[01:09:30]  And he got in a horrible accident and lost his ears.  And since he played the bass with his ears on his head, he had to teach himself all over  how to play without the ears.  Hysteria.  See how one of them finally went into a movie career and entered the movie Castaway.  The Roadshow.  The stage production, London of Castaway. 
[01:10:00]  What was the guy's name, Castaway?  The part of Wilson.  Wilson.  Wilson!  I used to be named Wilson.  Wilson!  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Yes, I got a real good feeling that they're going to have to change the name of that movie  to Hysterical.  Yeah.  Hysterical.  Going to have a big, big herb tomorrow.  Do some bong hits.  It's going to be funny.  Right on.  Well, they got the bad wig jobs and stuff.  Yeah, the bad 80s British rock guy wigs.  That just looked really bad. 
[01:10:30]  Even Spinal Tap's wigs last night were just like really bad.  Like for the movie, they were bad, but kind of gone.  And then I saw him backstage, the Spinal Tap guys, just kind of walking around because  they weren't hanging with anybody.  And it was frightening because they come out and Christopher Guest, I mean, completely  bald, he's gray, like beard, fat.  Yeah.  And you're like, wait a minute.  That's not Nigel.  What happened to Nigel?  What happened to Nigel?  I knew you should have given him the big bread.  He wanted big bread.  How many times do you think he sits in a bar and someone goes, hey, 
[01:11:00]  man, say, this one goes up to 11.  Hey, this one goes up to 11.  Could you shut up?  Oh, wait.  I don't even have the accent.  Look, could you shut up?  That's not what he said.  Do the accent, man.  No, really.  I'm really busy.  Say 11.  They have the mini stone head?  Yeah, the little stonehenge came down.  And oh, how they danced to little children of Stonehenge. 
[01:11:30]  And the stonehenge comes down and the little dwarf dances around it.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Were they in the pods?  No, they didn't have anything like that.  Were they in the pods?  No.  And it was sponsored by some kind of fake, like, depend undergarment.  So they had, like, big flyers in the back for these fake undergarments.  There it is.  Long ago, before the dawn of history. 
[01:12:00]  Hundreds of years, before the dawn of history.  Left a strange race of people.  The Druids.  You've seen that movie too many times.  Yeah, you've got to get out of the house.  Tony, what's up?  Who doesn't love the movie?  Hey, the guy's a dicks.  Brewer is a sick bastard, man.  Oh, we love Jim Brewer.  Dude, buddies of mine went to the show.  Yeah.  Best way to piss them off.  Say, hey, where's Squiggy, dick?  Oh, Michael McKeon? 
[01:12:30]  Dude, he had a...  Where's Squiggy?  Wait, you guys actually did that?  Friends of mine did.  They wouldn't give him autographs.  Where's Squiggy, dick?  They were being dicks, so he goes, hey, where's Squiggy, dick?  Welcome to Michael McKeon.  Go, hello.  Dude, he shot him off.  Hey, LeVayne.  That's funny.  That is very funny.  Hello, LeVayne.  Nice head, dick.  Where's Squiggy?  Thank you.  Good night.  We're Squiggy, dick.  Yeah, I see.  You know she's side, faggot.  Where the banshees live and they do live well. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, man.  Where a man.  Hysteria.  You wouldn't even know that we're playing Spino Tap music because we couldn't get the  rights to the real music.  I wonder if they performed the Def Leppard songs or if they actually got permission to use the  songs.  It was just a bad cover band version.  I remember hating him so much one time, I'd go out and beat Mexicans for that one video.  What was it?  Once bitten?  Remember? 
[01:13:30]  He was so over-exaggerating.  He'd go up, no, no, no.  He'd go up, when you make love.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  When you look in the shoes.  I'm just looking at me.  I'm going to get drunk and fight a Mexican.  Enough already.  What the hell does that mean?  All the chicks love them.  The chicks really like them.  And the bad videos.  That was like at the beginning of MTV with the swords and the chicks in the cages and  stuff.  Like, what does this even mean? 
[01:14:00]  Photograph.  Photograph was kind of a story.  Wasn't it like the Marilyn Monroe kind of story going on?  They were taking pictures of Marilyn Monroe.  Wow, this is so good.  Sugar on me.  One of the eight videos they played on MTV before they went, and showed the Apollo rocket  taking off 800 minutes of the day.  Was that guy a black guy?  Remember the one guy?  The big J.J. Jackson.  J.J. Jackson. 
[01:14:30]  All right, it's J.J. Jackson here.  We're going to premiere Thriller for you tonight.  Great, J.J.  Great.  They gave J.J. all the black artists.  You'd be banging your pillow to Nina Hartley?  Oh, Nina Blackwood.  Nina Blackwood.  And who looked just like a space cadet.  Martha Quinn.  Like she was on the dope.  Alan Hunter.  Martha Quinn was like the homebody.  Alan Hunter, wow.  Mark Goodman.  Mark Goodman.  Yeah, Martha Quinn was like the homebody chick.  The girl next door one.  And then there was a Nina Blackwood.  The rock who-a.  Hey, you're a rock who-a. 
[01:15:00]  You know, she was just...  E-R-R-W.  You just know she was honing everyone's knob.  She was like, hey, look who's here, man.  Take your shirt off.  See what you got, you D-L-R-W.  Nina, let's see your boobies.  She's a dirty little rock who-a.  We should take a break.  All right.  Hey, Jim Brewer's here to hang with us for a while.  Nice.  Brewer's.  Nice visit, Dick. 
[01:15:30]  Finally.  Jesus.  We kept saying, Brewer's on today.  We're psyched.  Brewer coming in?  No, Brewer's not coming in.  What happened?  Wow.  He couldn't get a sitter, I hear, the other day.  Hey.  Nice.  Dick.  A sitter.  A real man.  I was going to bring my kid in here.  Let her tear ass up in here.  Your mom turned ass last time you guys were here.  Yeah.  She was crazy.  Look at breweries playing all our cities, man, that we're in.  Oh.  Dallas, San Francisco, Chicago, Cleveland.  On the Hysteria Tour.  Wow.  That pretty much covers all the markets we're in right now. 
[01:16:00]  Or cities.  September.  Yeah.  September 22nd at the Canyon Club in Dallas.  All covered by VH1.  Okay.  Where am I playing?  I know.  Exactly.  When it gets closer, we'll tell everyone.

I don't even know what this means.  I'll do it in her voice.  See how I'm falling in from your elbows to your fingertips?  Know what that is?  That's about the same size as a Vermont Teddy Bear.  That's my Vermont Teddy Bear.  15 inches.  Bigger than you thought, right?

[01:18:00]  Rick took it hardcore.  What clip did you just check out there?  I checked out a guy who took out his eye.  He took out both eyes to prove that he was blind for Blind Dave.  Even though Blind Dave couldn't see, anyway.  Tell me that's not a buzzkill if you're high.  Yeah, you're at a party.  Dude, that guy had his eyes come out.  Shut up, dick.  Charlie, do it!  We were wondering if when he got punched in the face, they were just going to fly out of his head.  That's kind of scary.  The guy that pulled his eyes out, though, he won blind boxing. 
[01:18:30]  Decisively.  Yeah.  Blind Dave still recuperating from his blind boxing bout.  Broken ribs, cracked ribs, a bruised spleen, and a bruised kidney.  Bruised kidney.  TKO.  Or was it a KO?  It was every time we had a tell-in a break, and it was a TKO, yeah.  I think.  Wow.  We have Stephanie from Fox News.  Hey.  Where am I going?  Let me go.  Stephanie.  Let's talk to Stephanie. 
[01:19:00]  Stephanie, what's up?  How are you doing?  Hey.  We got you on the air.  I didn't mean to be on the air.  I kind of wanted to talk to you privately about something.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Nothing that interesting, though.  Is it good?  Yeah.  What do you want to talk to us about?  Well, it's nothing really sexy.  I don't think you're going to want your listeners listening to it.  It's kind of boring.  I want to book you on a show.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What?  Fox and Friends?  Or...  Bill O'Reilly?  Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly? 
[01:19:30]  I don't think he likes us, does he?  Well, he wants to talk to you.  No, that means he doesn't like us.  No, that doesn't mean anything.  Stinky.  Speak your piece, man.  I just think maybe a former employee had something to do with this.  Oh, you think Psycho Mark?  Oh.  Yeah.  Former employee Psycho Mark who got a settlement today.  A huge, huge settlement came in.  It went to arbitration, some kind of informal arbitration, and Psycho Mark walked away with  money that I think amounts in the tens of dollars for the use of his bits. 
[01:20:00]  He made less than $5,000 to completely wreck his career with our radio show and this radio  station.  Good job, Psycho Mark.  Bravo.  Hope it was worth it.  Hope you get some good weed.  Hey, guys.  Ass.  We can't play any of his clips anymore.  If we rerun a segment with Psycho Mark, he wants to be paid a couple hundred dollars.  So the choice is, all right, we'll just move on and outplay his stuff. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  All for less than $5,000 to wreck his radio career.  Good move, Mark.  Take his shirt off.  Stephanie, I don't know if we'll be doing the Bill O'Reilly show.  Well, but listen, it's about the corruption of today's American youth.  Oh, my God.  What in the hell are you on here?  Let me tell you something.  This is American.  You want to know about corruption of youth?  It's the darn you-know-what's, and I ain't going to say it.  Rinds with biggers. 
[01:21:00]  Okay?  Oh, my God.  Go ahead and laugh it up, hotshot.  This is America.  Now, you better crap or get off your donkey.  Okay, go ahead and hoot and holl it up, you chink lover.  When's the last time you've seen a chink walk in the streets?  Good night, show's over.  They blow their bombs in the basements because this is America.  Now, get it together.  Now, you want the Jamaicans coming in when you've got the darn Haitians playing with their yo-yos like it's going out of style? 
[01:21:30]  Ring your bell, hotshot.  This is America.  Wake up, Hammer.  Will Hammer.  Stephanie's back on the line.  Stephanie, what happened?  Well, you cut me off, and I was telling you how we're looking at it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Something happened when you're falling.  No, you guys cut me off.  No, man.  You dogged me.  I was sitting here, and all of a sudden you hung up on me.  That's not possible with our new phone system.  Well, someone there made a little bit of an error because I was cut off.  All right, make your pitch to get Opie and Anthony on the Bill O'Reilly Show. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, Stephanie, are you a blonde woman, are you?  I am a blonde woman.  Are you American?  I am American.  You're not one of them darn Nicaraguans, are you?  Nope.  Okay, then.  Let's hear what you got, Hammer.  Well, here's the deal.  I think you guys need to come on the show because we're talking about the corruption of American youth.  You've got to do a little better than that.  Yeah.  Sell it.  Yeah, sell it.  You want me to sell it?  Yeah, give us the pitch.  Why we should be on the Bill O'Reilly Show.  Okay, well, you're one of the people that... 
[01:22:30]  Oh, oh, so horrible.  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know.  A phone came to shoot.  I'm sorry, man.  That was my fault.  That is so bad.  That was my fault.  What a stupid voice.  Everybody wants us on their show so they can just trash us.  I know.  We finally figured out how this game is played.  Finally.  Pretend I'm really into...  Tell them...  Right.  Tell them I have a son their age and they adore them.  Right.  Please, can you do this for me?  I am...  Bury these animals. 
[01:23:00]  They are Satan worshipers.  Having blind people box each other.  It's medieval and I've had it.  You should see the piece they did.  Oh, wait.  As he goes home and bangs a hooker.  Stephanie.  That's a guy.  Who's a hooker?  Stephanie.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hi.  What's happening on your phone, man?  It's really not my phone.  It's you guys.  It can't be us.  You know what happened...  We're here with Jim Brewer.  We're on in seven cities.  We don't have time to fool around.  This happened yesterday because Pete Johnson, the engineer here at NEW, just hooked up the  national phone line. 
[01:23:30]  See?  And sometimes now when they pick up on the national side, it hangs up on the New York side.  So I want to apologize for that.  That happened to me a couple of times.  I tried to get through to you guys.  Remember that happened last week?  That's right.  Thank you.  See, they were trying to put the blame on me.  I know.  All right.  Well, we thought because we hadn't hung up that it was you, but I know now it's Pete.  So what's happening?  It's just kind of short-circuiting because of what?  I think so.  There's like something going on between the national lines and this one, but...  Is it personal?  No.  All right.  Let me put you...  Hold on.  Let me put you on the VIP, and that should keep you from hell. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, all right.  All right.  You're on the VIP now.  All right.  The big pitch to get Opie and Anthony on the Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly.  Stephanie, if you would please.  Okay.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Yes.  The big pitch is as follows.  Bill O'Reilly is sort of a legend.  Isn't that the most painful thing?  I'm cringing.  I can't take any more.  If that line rings again, I'm going to wet myself. 
[01:24:30]  I'm going to wet myself.  I'll bring my shoes and my glass so that I have them.  Is this her calling back?  Hello, Stephanie.  What's going on?  I thought I was on the VIP line.  Look, look.  I'm really getting pissed off.  We have a show to do.  Jim Brewer is...  I'm getting ready to leave.  Yes.  Do you guys want to call me back?  No.  We got you on now.  Let's get this over with.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  When would you like us on the Bill O'Reilly show?  Well, we'd like to sit down and talk with you the beginning of August to talk to you 
[01:25:00]  sort of what the effect music and radio has on...  That's awful.  I stare at Opie's finger on the hang-up button like, oh no, when's it going to happen?  The anticipation's killing me.  He's not going on Bill O'Reilly.  He just wants to trash us.  Of course.  No.  F. Bill O'Reilly.  He's a fan.  No, he's...  Screw him.  He used to be on some pretty wacky shows himself before... 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  He tried to go legit.  Huh?  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Could you get pee?  Because this is not funny.  Yeah, make sure this doesn't happen again because I'm getting sick of this.  Because we got the executive producer from Big Brother calling in as well.  Stephanie.  Am I the prank now?  No.  We never take it this far.  It wouldn't even be funny after this.  Stephanie, you would know if we were pranking you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  Usually the stupid ones don't know. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, okay.  How long do I have this time before you hang up on me again?  I'm not hanging up on you!  I thought I was on the VIP line.  Get it through your thick head.  Hey.  Opie.  We're not hanging up on her.  Would you stop?  Hey, do you know Richard Jenny?  Are you talking to me?  No, I don't know Richard.  No.  Just wondering.  Okay.  All right.  Now, what's the thing is, the downfall of American youth?  What is it?  Well, I just want to sit down and chat with you guys about the effect that music and radio 
[01:26:30]  has on young kids.  Yeah.  And, you know, you seem to be, you know, one of those shock jocks, as they love to call  them over here.  And we just sort of want to sit down and get your opinion on this and what you think.  How much does what you say affect how people behave?  Hello?  Hello?  Silent game, always funny. 
[01:27:00]  Hello?  I guess she didn't read Time.  This thing on.  Hello?  Yeah, it's right there in Time Magazine.  Time Wrecks one of our best bits by printing it.  Oh, well.  Bill O'Reilly.  So, you're responsible for the youth of America going to hell. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, Bill.  Next.  What do you think of those Olsen twins?  All right.  Where were we?  I love them.  I'm going to go fight a Mexican and punch my wife.  Where were we?  We were talking about blind boxing or we were starting on something.  The guy's eyes.  Yeah, popping the eye off him.  I think we were done with that.  Cracked ribs, something.  Spinal tap.  Spinal tap.  Yeah, I was kind of done with tap.  Are we still in July? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, maybe we were talking about that.  Boy, this is a long month.  This month goes forever and ever.  What did you guys do the fourth?  Oh.  You calling that sir?  Joe, what's up?  Funny with that.  They won't let you say the P word, though.  Oh, sorry, guys.  He wet himself.  You wet himself.  He wet himself driving.  Thank you, Joe.  No problem.  All right, bye.  I was telling one of your stories.  I'm going to ask you during commercials if you can, because I don't want to put you on 
[01:28:30]  the spot.  Oh.  I was telling one of Jim Brewer stories to my brothers.  They were dying.  That's all I can say, because I'll give it.  Well, here, give me a pen.  And talk for a second.  Christy and now Ashley are calling back from Dallas.  You know, the 18-year-old girls?  Yeah, we're in Dallas.  Listen to this.  Hi, Christy and Ashley. 
[01:29:00]  What's up?  It's almost like Mary, Kate, and Ashley.  Ashley doesn't want to talk to you, though.  Why?  I don't know.  She said she doesn't want to talk.  Put that bitch on the phone.  Hey, that's like my best friend.  It's like totally a cool chick, and you're so not.  Don't you love this?  They're 18.  Watch this.  Put that little slut on the phone.  Hey!  It's so not nice.  That, like, upsets them so much.  It's not funny.  She just hung up.  Yeah.  Anthony, I totally said you were cute, but now you're a jerk. 
[01:29:30]  You call anyone, like, in their, I don't know, late 20s, early 30s, up in that thing,  you go, hey, slut.  They turn around and go, shut up, a-hole.  You know, you call a teen girl, I got a slut.  Hey, stop it!  You're so not cool.  Yeah, I'm not a slut.  You were going to be my best friend because I made you first, but now you're not.  And you totally kissed Jeffrey, and I know you didn't want to kiss until I liked him,  but then Karen kissed him, and it's because Karen got cheerleading, and that's why,  did you hear, Jeff, I just got my period, but you tell my mother because she'll totally 
[01:30:00]  tell everyone, and my sister, I hate my snow, no boo, you know what I meant.  Damn, that's funny.  Oh, my God, I have three pubes.  Yeah, a lot of people, a lot of people hanging up on us today.  I don't know why.  That is just no light to say, it's no good, it's a caca.  Willie!  Hey, Willie, what's up, man?  Willie.  What's up?  Hey, we're hanging with Jim Brewer today.  Yeah, I know, dude.  Jim, you rule, dude. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, well, thank you.  I love you, dude, man.  You got this.  Hey, ho, hey, ho.  You got some crazy ass?  You're like half-baked, huh?  Yeah, dude, that was great.  There's a lot of half-baked or something.  Right on, man.  Hey, Opie, I was thinking, you want to talk about, like, bad hair VJ, man.  Adam Curry.  Remember him?  Hey, remember Adam Curry?  Oh, wow, Adam Curry.  Adam Curry.  Yeah.  He was part of that whole, when you had the 80s metal guys going.  He was going for that Frampton Comes Alive look or something. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, I know.  You may know me, I'm a VJ.  Adam Curry.  Wow, dude.  There's a name from the past.  I'm an MTV VJ.  I think Alan Hunter was the worst, though, because he just, he looked like he didn't belong.  At least Adam Curry was trying.  Oh, and what's their name?  Which guy was Alan Hunter?  Uh, the blonde.  Blonde hair?  You got the teeth?  Uh, I don't think of someone else.  He was one of the original.  Short blonde guy?  Yeah, short blonde guy.  Um, didn't fit in at all. 
[01:31:30]  I used to love Judas Priest on there.  Oh, yeah, dude.  Video, you got another thing coming?  Yeah.  And at the end.  The dude's head blows up.  Look at Will.  The dude's head blows up.  But also, Halford was offline with the actual song, so it'd be like, he would say, uh,  you got another thing coming, baby.  And his voice, his lips would be like three seconds later.  You guys saw that, Dick?  It's totally not real.  All right, Willie.  Thank you very much. 
[01:32:00]  You guys suck.  Hey, thanks for the support in Cleveland.  We greatly appreciate it.  Hey, dude.  I'm talking to everybody, dude.  You guys are starting to pick up around here.  Right on.  Get the wow on the back of your car.  Hey, how you guys doing with Rocker?  Oh, dude.  Oh, yeah.  Is that a good thing?  Oh, I know, dude.  He's awesome, dude.  Hasn't he blown, like, three games already?  Yeah, but...  Yeah, because he's too busy going to OzFest.  Isn't it true that he flew to OzFest when he was supposed to be pitching, or he came  back a couple hours before game time or something?  Oh, really?  I'm not too sure about all that.  I think it went to OzFest. 
[01:32:30]  If that's true, I'm going to take back everything I said about it.  Right.  I mean, he's an emotional player.  You've got to give him, like, if just one thing pisses him off, that's it.  He's done.  He's, like, he's so, like, mad.  I'm sick of the neighbors and the part of the kids and the Cubans.  Get up, faggot.  Right on.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Hey, right on, Willie.  Thanks.  Uh-huh.  Bye.  Get the wow on the back of your car.  It works like a charm.  All right.  All right, man.  Bye. 
[01:33:00]  Hey, Christy's calling back from Dallas.  Oh, good.  All over the place today.  Christy.  Hello.  Sick.  Hey.  Where's Ashley?  I'm sorry.  My friend hung up on you guys.  Where's Ashley?  She doesn't want to talk to you guys because you called her a slut.  Well, everyone knows, Christy.  I told her you guys were just playing with her.  But she sounds like the hot one.  Who's hotter, you or her?  Me.  I don't know.  No, I'm hearing Ashley's hotter than you, and she's a goer.  You're the prissy one, and she's the goer. 
[01:33:30]  I told her we made out with Todd behind the chimney.  You know what we're talking about when we say she's a slut, right?  Yeah.  I told you guys we were just playing with her that you do that.  Yeah, but you know what we're talking about.  Remember in school what happened with her?  Right?  Am I right?  God, no.  Sweetheart, have you ever fought a Mexican?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Have you done the deed yet, Christy?  Huh? 
[01:34:00]  Have you done the deed?  What?  Have you done the deed?  What?  I can't hear you.  What?  You're 18.  Have you done it yet?  No.  You're a virgin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Duh.  Yeah.  Duh.  Yeah.  Duh.  Well, what are you waiting for?  Yeah, what are you waiting for?  I'm waiting for the right person.  Good for you.  I'm not a whore or anything.  All right, good.  I'm with her.  I'm proud of her.  All right, Christy, we're done with you.  No, no, no. 
[01:34:30]  Hey.  We like talking to the loose ones.  Hey, hey, wait.  God, I feel high today, man.  We like the ones that have a little of that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Have a little of that low hang down thing going from me.  From abuse.  Let's get high and talk about aliens.  All right.  They saw some UFOs in Jersey.  Recently?  You see that?  Recently?  Just over the weekend.  What are you talking about?  In Carteret, New Jersey.  All right, let's take a commercial break. 
[01:35:00]  I'll hit the stairway and let's really talk about it.  Okay, we can do that.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Toke it up.  Dude, I heard.  Think about it.  All right.  Jim Brewer in the studio.  We're in the middle of Star Wars right now as we speak.  We could be like just living.  Dude's got fake eyes.  On a molecule underneath a big giant's fingernail.  That could be our whole universe, man.  How do you know that?  And dude, under our fingernail, we could have an entire universe. 
[01:35:30]  Do you think, think about this and judge me?  See, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see, see,  give me a second.  Don't do so much next time, faggot.  Sorry, dick.  You didn't tell me it was like that.  This is the faggot.  Just give me a second and think about this.  Right.  Michael Jackson, okay?  Yeah.  Possibly a prophet. 
[01:36:00]  Wow.  Profit.  Faggot.  Whatever.  Dick.  I hope he was the best.  He goes, wow.  He always had that one press.  You know that guy.  We totally judge him.  If he's black or white, doesn't matter.  He said it.  Am I right?  He always had the one press.  No, he couldn't convert, so he would just go, am I right?  Wow.  Does it make sense?  Look.  Well, yeah.  He's into kids.  Why?  Because kids are pure, and they know evil, and that's why he's not, and you're evil for judging 
[01:36:30]  him whether he's a black dude, a black, a white, or a chick.  Dude, shut up and pack a bowl, dick.  Oh, crap.  I dropped it.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Anyone got a lighter?  I can't find it.  It's in the bushes, dick.  Marijuana is the bomb.  I only had a freaking dime bag.  Go back to Rice, Rosedale, buy it from the Rican's. 
[01:37:00]  Marijuana is an narcotic, medically and legally.  It never did anybody any good, and does everybody a lot of harm.  That's right.  Uh-oh.  Christy's calling back, and she's crying.  Christy?  Christy?  Hello?  What's the matter, Christy?  Why did you hang up on me?  You're our pal, right?  Yeah.  There you go.  You're out there in Dallas.  Mm-hmm.  Christy, we hung up on you because, quite frankly, you're kind of boring.  I am not boring.  And there's not much to you? 
[01:37:30]  Let's hear a good story.  You're a pretty simple lad.  All right.  Give us a story we might find exciting.  Go ahead.  Yeah, give us a good story.  Okay.  Let's see.  One time at band camp?  When my friend Larry tried to use his finger, I didn't make sure my parents were saying.  My friend Ashley was going to cuss you out, but I told her not to.  Cuss.  Shouldn't be cussing, you city suckers, you concrete walkers, you shoe-wiring city folk. 
[01:38:00]  Hey, Christy.  Huh?  Has any guy reached patch yet?  Yeah, how about that?  What?  Patch is the bomb.  Has anybody reached patch on you?  No.  No?  What do you do, some karate moves to make sure he stays out of there?  Do you try to put his arm around you and fill you up?  No.  Never tried that?  No.  That's a good move.  What's the matter?  You don't got boobies yet?  I do, too.  Have you given oral favors yet? 
[01:38:30]  No, she hasn't done anything.  You're 18, right, Christy?  Huh?  You're 18, right?  Yeah.  You must be kind of a chubby son.  Yeah, now I'm just thinking you're a chubby.  Yeah.  I am not.  I am not.  No oral favors.  You ever give a handy?  No.  Those 707s really can't hug this guy.  Hey, Opie.  Show me yours, show me mine.  Are your boobs still in the shape of a coat?  Shut up.  Hey, Opie. 
[01:39:00]  Opie.  He's right here.  You can talk.  Okay.  My friend Ashley thinks you're hot.  Hot?  She thinks you're hot.  Well, I don't care.  Ashley will do you.  Ashley will do you, too, because she's a slut, Opie.  She's a lot of slut.  I ain't talking about aliens.  She is a virgin, man.  And you're a prude, Christy.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  Yes, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  You can kiss me.  Kiss my ass.  Okay.  Can I kiss you on your dirty spot?  No.  Shut up.  What about the dirtiest of all spots, Christy? 
[01:39:30]  How about that spot?  No.  No.  No.  Right.  What, do the boys prefer sheep over there where you are?  No.  Cows?  Hold on.  You don't even know what goes on in Texas, okay?  All right.  Hold on.  We want to just listen to a little tune.  What is this?  Oh.  I am the cute one.  It's a yellow.  It's a yellow.  Turn it off.  Give me a headache. 
[01:40:00]  I'm not green.  I'm the cute one.  I've got you.  I've got you.  I am the cute one.  Oh, my God.  Is this you and Ashley?  No.  No.  I am the cute one.  Anyone knows?  I've got the profile.  She's got the nose.  She's got the nose.  She was a whore.  Hey, who's the stripper? 
[01:40:30]  Stupid hooker.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  That is so old.  Yeah, you got that right.  I'll give you that one.  I'll start that for late.  All right.  I've been listening to your show since it first came on here.  I'm beginning to start hating you guys.  They're all pink on the inside.  I'm dying.  Oh, God. 
[01:41:00]  John.  How was I supposed to know she was underage?  Sweet, miserable crap.  Pussah.  You know what I'm saying, Doc.  Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it.  You take it now.  Are you...  Am I getting on your... 
[01:41:30]  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Am I getting on your nerves?  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Am I getting on your nerves?  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Stop it.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Stop it.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up.  Shut up, Demi.  Hey.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hey.  How'd you like to suck my ass? 
[01:42:00]  Shut up.  Virgin.  And I'm proud of it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Hey, everybody.  We're not going to get laid.  Hey.  Could you shut up?  Quiet.  Hey, man.  Save me a fork.  God.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  Put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.  Can I touch it? 
[01:42:30]  You know what I think?  Shut up, Demi.  I think you guys aren't getting any because you're doing this.  Shut up, Demi.  Don't just stare at it. Eat it.  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Demi.  Suck it.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. See, your name's Danny Falker.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Whatever you do, I'm not hanging up.  I'm going to keep calling.

Yeah  You just go around with it 
[02:07:30]  Dude, I got screwed  This is Time  In Time Magazine  This is the best thing  You could come up with  For Time  Let me  Let me explain  Please  Alright  We did an interview  With this jerk off  Ass  Ass  Tool  Knob  Jerk  Joel Stein  However  Admit  Before it went that way  You were like  Dude, you understand  The interview we're doing  I don't think you do  You want your boat faggot?  Then shut up 
[02:08:00]  Cause this is heavy  Maybe I'll  Maybe I'll talk about you  Maybe  You build up this  Oh, it just  This guy sat an hour and a half up in the conference room, right?  He's asking all kinds of questions.  What the hell is this?  Oh, is it?  More Mary Kay.  Very funny.  Very funny.  More Mary Kay.  Anthony is getting so high. 
[02:08:30]  His pockets are so tight right now.  This is hot.  And this song was when they were young.  Daddy pocket tight.  Daddy pocket tight.  All right.  Anthony Weinstein's point.  All right.  We talked to this jerk ass.  Joel Stein.  Joel Stein.  Joel Stein.  I thought I wrote a nice piece.  Nice piece.  We're about an hour and a half up in the conference room.  Intriguing.  Intriguing.  Insightful.  Insightful.  He asked us questions.  Right.  He asked us questions about everything.  And we were upstairs, and I'm kicking back.  I'm answering them.  I'm feeling good about this.  You know? 
[02:09:00]  Did you give me a big riff on Leave it to Beaver?  Did you go crazy?  No.  You know something?  No.  What I did was, I was not the on-air person.  He's asking questions about behind the scenes and the show and how we got started and what  he thinks our audience is all about.  Like, just questions.  An hour and a half.  And I'm answering them and feeling good.  Like, all right.  You know, I'm really getting my point across on a lot of this stuff.  You're not trying to be a wise-ass or anything.  Brewer is laughing.  What is your point?  Brewer has been here, man.  You're like, I ain't even going to drink before to get high. 
[02:09:30]  This is going to be great.  And then what do they print?  Goat boy, right?  You give them everything, they print goat boy.  Brewer's been here, man.  Brewer.  So we're talking, talking.  So then he goes, look, could I hang out during the show a little bit?  We're like, all right, sure.  So before the show, we go back into the office, right?  We're hanging out.  I'm walking out of the office.  The Mary-Kate and Ashley poster's right there.  I go, look how hot they're getting.  Like, I'm goofing.  I go, look how hot they're getting. 
[02:10:00]  And that's an old picture.  I go, look, that one's the prude.  I go, but that one, she's the goer.  Yes, there it is.  That was it.  Yes.  I walk, and then I walk out.  We do the show.  On further inspection, he dismisses Mary-Kate as the priss.  Like it was this big calculated thing.  Ashley is the goer, unquote.  See, you let your guard down.  You felt comfortable.  I know.  I know.  You never do that.  An hour and a half, I gave calculated answers to every goddamn question.  They break you down.  This mother-friggin' tool prints an off-the-walk.  It's like Marathon, man.  He breaks you down.  Is it safe? 
[02:10:30]  Is it safe?  Is it safe?  Joel Stein, he just breaks you down.  You're absolutely right.  He's Lawrence Olivier.  Is it safe?  Is it safe?  That was the only quote they used from Anthony.  The only quote.  And I swear to God, I answered everything.  Is it safe?  Is it safe?  I don't know what you mean.  I don't know.  How do you feel about Mary-Kate Matthews? 
[02:11:00]  How do you feel about...  Are they safe?  Are they safe?  I don't really have an opinion.  Are they safe?  Which one is the goer?  Which one is the goer?  Ashley's the goer.  Ashley's the goer.  We will take a break now.  He wore me down.  You're right.  Son of a bitch.  That was it right there.  God damn it.  The only quote in time.  Why do you say Mary-Kate is the prince? 
[02:11:30]  No.  No.  And you know what the thing is, Jim, about this whole thing?  And you know, it's time effing magazine.  Sure, I've been in the penthouse.  Something like that ends up in penthouse.  It's not like it's going to end up on a dentist office table a year later.  It's not like, you know, a magazine I could take over to mom to see.  Something that all my mother's friends now are reading.  And going, oh, your son, the pedophile.  Great. 
[02:12:00]  Great.  Yeah, we know, Anthony.  We'll lock our kids up when he comes to visit you.  Now, sweetheart, I know you talk highly, the young man.  And I know he's adorable and he's got the big show.  But that was very disturbing, sweetheart.  I agree.  What was that obsession with the Mary-Kate and Ashley?  That was totally uncalled for.  Why would he say something like that?  It is Time magazine.  Hey, Margaret, I don't ever think I can read Time magazine the same way again.  He said he was funny. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I think they were talking about you on the news last night.  We got a clip.  Were they?  Oh, yeah.  When I get out, I'm going to get drunk.  I'm going to get some drugs.  And I'm going to get the first kid that I see.  You ass.  What?  What the hell?  What?  That was a background check we did on Anthony.  It was a fine lady talking about a pedophile in their neighborhood.  Wow.  And they overheard him and that's what he said.  And then I sit there and go, you know, oh, maybe I'll get a better quote in the next Time magazine we're in. 
[02:13:00]  It's like, how many times are you in Time magazine unless you're right at the top?  It's like the second paragraph.  Oh, I know.  And it ends.  Ashley is the goer.  And then you go through the rest of that interview.  Opie says.  Opie responds.  Opie comments.  Opie says.  Opie said.  Opie.  I get not another goddamn thing.  And then he called up yesterday, this little prick. 
[02:13:30]  And he calls up yesterday and goes, oh, well, you were just pretty quiet the whole interview.  He's like, what?  Were you?  No.  No.  I swear to God.  I think he talked more than me.  But this guy all of a sudden is like.  I think you had the hots for you.  Joel had the hots for you.  That's what I think.  I'm playing the fad card here now.  I understand.  But I'm playing the fad card.  Look, look.  I work in the media.  I'm on The Daily Show.  Word is Joel Stein likes blondes.  See?  That's all I'm saying.  And I'm just saying.  All of a sudden, he's just listening to everything Opie's saying. 
[02:14:00]  And I was just a piece of trash sitting there to a kid-touching piece of trash.  Killed our chances of getting the Olsen twins on the show.  Yeah.  And then he writes that we don't even prepare for our show.  It looks like a bunch of guys just waiting for a pizza.  That's what we do before the show.  Yeah.  I agree with that.  You're less like people preparing for a radio show than people waiting for a pizza.  Where is that pizza?  Get this guy in here.  Let's kick his ass.  Guys, jerk off.  We talked to him yesterday.  See what he does before he works.  There's one quote I get in Time Magazine, and it's, they're looking hot. 
[02:14:30]  The Ashley.  But you asked for it.  You let your guard down, man.  You're right.  We let him into the office.  Which one is the going?  Which one is the going?  Mary Kate's the press.  Which one is the going?  Mary Kate's the press.  You want to be in Time Magazine, don't you?  You don't want to be in time.  Yeah.  Just tell me one thing, and you can be in time.  Which one is the going?  I don't know. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, I can tell you.  Hey, someone has something interesting here.  TJ.  Hey, are you sure that quote was talking about Anthony, and it wasn't just Paula Poundstone?  Wait, let's listen.  Is this Paula?  Yeah, let's listen again.  Is this Paula?  When I get out, I'm going to get drunk, I'm going to get some drugs, and I'm going to  get the first kid that I see.  Sounds like a woman wearing a bow tie.  That sounds like Paula to me.  A woman wearing a bow tie.  Do you know Paula Poundstone, huh, Jim? 
[02:15:30]  I never came, no.  No, never worked with her?  No, no, no, no.  I was molested by her.  Why were you?  She did, I teabagged her, and then it was all a blur after that.  And then knowing how she teabagged you.  Whoa!  I wouldn't put it past that having a sack.  Twelve foster kids doing a high school cheer.  Mommy, mommy, I teabagged.  Anthony, today's the last day as time being the enemy of the show. 
[02:16:00]  Because we'll have a new enemy after our piece on Fox News.  Oh, yeah, so now Fox News comes in a couple weeks ago, does a whole piece on us that's  running on Fox tonight on the 10 o'clock news.  They are going to kill us.  I just know it's just going to be, how did they edit that together?  Mary Kate and Ashley, hot.  Want them to lick it.  I'm trying to remember what we said during that one.  Oh, there's no remembering it.  Oh, man.  Hi, Fox News.  Can we set up some equipment? 
[02:16:30]  No.  No, not that so.  Hi, this is Britt Hume.  Let's get the interview started.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Now, I'm working off of this Time magazine article that you think Ashley is a goer.  Is that correct?  No, I never said that.  Smith, don't make me bring in Bill O'Reilly.  You did tell all your ex-girlfriends you were in this magazine, weren't you in your drunken  stupor?  No, no, stop.  I can't even know.  Yeah, how much were you talking about this that everybody knew? 
[02:17:00]  Were you like, just, I'm going to be a time, I'm going to be a...  Oh, don't.  Right?  Charlie, you up?  I up.  What's up?  What magazine you been in?  That's what I thought.  That's what I'm thinking.  What time is it?  It's time.  What time is it?  It's time to look like a pedophile.  Apparently.  Dude, presents are in time.  Now, do you have the Dodge Caravan that has the remote control sliding doors so they can  just jump right in?  Trap them in.  Yeah, I put the puppy in there.  And then I open it up in front of the school. 
[02:17:30]  When they get in, I shut it right closed.  You tape sweet tarts to the outside of the door.  Sweet tarts.  And go for the sweet tarts.  You open the door, they fall in.  They're yours.  I leave little trails of that sugary pixie dust candy.  Out of the dots.  The dots on the wax paper.  A dot trail.  Right.  I would eat the paper.  So there you have it.  Get the paper out of your mouth, goddammit.  Tom, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, man?  You're on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:18:00]  Out in Harrisburg.  I'm a driver.  I go out to Harrisburg once a week.  Yeah.  Found out that they're going to try to bring in blind boxing there next week.  On another radio station?  Yeah.  Yeah, blind boxing's going to sweep the country now.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  And you guys ought to be thankful that Time Den published that O.P. likes condoms and Anthony  don't.  Yeah.  That's a clip.  Yeah, that's a clip.  There's some sound clips that just get us in trouble around here.  All right.  You guys suck.  I'll talk to you later.  Do we have that isolated clip?  No.  This reminds me.  Can I just tell you this real quick? 
[02:18:30]  What happened to me at Stand Up New York?  I'm at a club here in town.  Here comes the joke.  No, I'm not doing that.  I am not doing that.  I knew it.  I knew it.  Suck it.  Suck it.  I knew it.  I'm sorry, Paul.  I had to.  I know.  I know.  When he said blind, forget it.  I'm not even going to tell you now.  I'll tell you off air.  Forget it.  Knock, knock.  What happened at Stand Up New York?  No.  No.  I won't tell you.  We did that same gag on Richard Jennings. 
[02:19:00]  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  That's awful.  Move it back.  Everyone was laughing through it.  Here's when it happens to Richard Jennings.  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  That was a joke.  It's like taking a shovel to a guy's face.  Isn't it?  It's awful.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Cheryl.  Yes.  Hey.  This is Cheryl, who got kicked out of the Big Brother house last week. 
[02:19:30]  How are you, Cheryl?  How are you doing?  Good.  Pretty good.  Great.  Welcome to New York.  Thank you.  I wish I was up there.  And many other cities, actually.  So...  Yes, we're big time.  Where are you calling from?  From Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.  Yeah, you're the hot mom that got kicked out of the Big Brother house.  Yes.  What happened?  Oh, it's a little twist in it that went all wrong.  Mike brought me in as being the nice guy. 
[02:20:00]  And then, because they weren't the nice guys, I ended up getting kicked out to teach everybody  a lesson.  You're still believing that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I heard a little footage on, I was the one, you know, I was more of a threat than anybody  else than Nicole, so that was not, you know, I didn't take myself as a threat.  I thought I was kind of a nice, quiet kind of person.  That's what I thought, sweetie.  I don't understand why this happened. 
[02:20:30]  Who watched your kids while you were on the show?  She told her family.  Oh, my mother and my sister.  How old are your kids?  She's got a stink to it.  17 and 14.  Oh, wow.  You're hot.  Which one's the goer?  All the guys in the house wanted you, huh, Cheryl?  I, well, supposedly.  Did you?  Of course, I didn't know that.  They were all saying it behind closed doors.  I think they were a little chicken.  I saw some of you.  You had to know.  Hey, how much?  There you go.  How much does it suck?  How much does it suck to be the first person kicked out? 
[02:21:00]  No one remembers the first one kicked out ever.  Hi, sucker.  I don't know about that.  I think they're remembering.  No, not when the show's over.  How many people remember Deb?  Who?  Guess what?  I'm on the show.  Nice head.  How many people remember the first guy kicked out of, um, the first survivor?  Richard Jenny.  No one remembers him.  How many people remember the first child kicked out of Anthony's van? 
[02:21:30]  Wow.  That's awful.  Cheryl, so what did you think of Justin?  Her name is Sandy, by the way.  Yeah.  I thought Justin was a pretty interesting character.  He kept everybody going.  Did you, uh, did you find yourself attracted to Justin?  To Justin?  Yes.  Nah.  He likes putting knives to the, to the throat there.  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  We, uh, I didn't know anything about it until Friday morning.  Yeah, but in his defense, the woman had leaks all over her neck.  He was just trying to chop up some leaks for dinner.  That was my own defense. 
[02:22:00]  With Nicole, that was my defense.  She had parsley on her neck, and I needed to get some parsley to garnish my steak.  I mistook her neck for the chopping block.  Can't a man in America garnish a steak with parsley from his wife's neck?  My God.  Hey, Tommy.  What's going on, guys?  You're on with Cheryl, who got kicked out of the Big Brother house.  Oh, Cheryl, can I tell you you're the hottest mother in America?  I would plug it myself.  Oh, so sweet.  I would pleasure myself to you about four times an episode. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, no.  You would pleasure yourself to Barney, I mean.  You are so hot.  God.  How does it make you?  When you did those, when you would CT us all in an American public, when you would do  that thing, when you put your hair back under that water with your bikini on.  Yeah, you look good in that bikini, Cheryl.  You did.  Thank you.  A lot of guys whacking it to you.  Oh, I'm whacking it right now to you.  Is that wrong?  I know.  That's very good.  That's very healthy.  Oh, you're a god, Brewer.  I love you guys.  Have a good day.  Hey, Cheryl, you look pretty good in that thorn, by the way. 
[02:23:00]  I want to...  Can I smell it?  All right.  Tommy, thank you.  Nice.  Nice.  Hey, Dick.  His big opportunity was to say, can I smell it?  Can I smell it?  What's the matter with you?  What a tool.  He had a friend there with him on that one.  Can I smell it?  Cheryl, you get it right?  This is my kind of background.  Say what?  Say what?  Can you smell it?  Should I say, can I eat it?  No, you wouldn't want to eat it.  You just want to smell it.  Say, can you look at it? 
[02:23:30]  No, look at it.  It smells between eating and looking.  Do smell.  Say, can you lick it?  Hey, Cheryl.  Say it.  God, I feel like I'm back in the house again.  What are you guys doing to each other?  We're smoking a lot of dupe.  Well, Cheryl.  Well, hold on.  Jason has a question for Cheryl, Anthony.  Oh.  A big fan of Big Brother.  All right.  Jason.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Cheryl, I got a question for you.  Hi, Jason.  Yeah, you sound hot and you look hot, too.  I was just wondering, do you like it in... 
[02:24:00]  I couldn't hear you.  I'm coming out of...  Hey, I asked if you like it in...  You guys roll.  All right.  I thought that was what he said.  Yeah.  Do you?  People are terrible like that.  They really are.  You seem like a pretty sexually free woman.  Yeah.  I better be in that place.  Right.  And what...  In Da Stupor? 
[02:24:30]  Who on the show were you...  What's going on in there?  Who were you attracted to on the show?  Who did you really want to get in the sack with?  Oh, let's see.  I think Hardy was probably the one that was most attractive to me.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Hardy was nice.  Are you okay?  Somebody's gagging there.  No, it's not us.  Everyone's fine here.  He's playing with himself again. 
[02:25:00]  I can hear him.  What's in the water in Florida?  Tell me.  What's in the water?  Have you got any offers to do anything?  Television, magazines, anything like that?  Not as of yet.  Are you going to go naked in AARP magazines?  Yeah, exactly.  No, I haven't hit AARP.  I'm still too young for that.  Well, a lot of people that come out of the reality shows, they get the opportunity to go and playboy or something.  What would you think about that?  Would you do it?  Yeah, I think I might do it.  Oh.  How about a naked lotto drawing where you draw the ping pong balls for Channel 7 News here in New York? 
[02:25:30]  Don't you like the condom balloons that were water?  We filled up condoms for water balloons.  We went back to high school.  Telted each other.  You're going to have to excuse him.  He's out of his mouth. 
[02:26:00]  Okay, get your breath now.  Okay.  He fell off the chair.  Wow.  I thought that was right in the Richard Jenny wheelhouse.  What?  I thought that was funny.  I just didn't even know.  It's the Richard Jenny wheelhouse.  I love it, a lot of comfortability I haven't felt since my wedding night.  The best thing I've ever seen. 
[02:26:30]  And then he just loses his mind.  Hi Cheryl, where's the...  Hi, what are you guys doing to each other in there?  Do you actually...  Okay, tell him to breathe.  Breathe deep and slow.  I cannot breathe. 
[02:27:00]  I can't breathe.  He's on the floor.  What are you guys doing?  I'm laughing too hard.  Cheryl, you're a funny lady.  Did you actually think you were calling a radio show and we're actually on the air with this crap?  You just called someone's house.  Yeah.  Nice head, Dick. 
[02:27:30]  Wow, okay, that's cool.  Wow, my stomach hurts.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Well, there's not really much to ask you because you only were on the show a couple episodes.  Yeah.  But did you have a good time?  Is it something that you look back fondly on?  Hang on a second.  We're all trying to care.  It was extremely interesting on there.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Come on, care.  Come on.  Come on, care.  Come on, brow. 
[02:28:00]  Forrow my brow.  Forrow.  Care.  I just can't get it up.  Sorry.  Empty.  Empty in the care department.  Hey, you want to...  The pooper is empty with care.  There's no care in my pooper for you.  Have you even pulled off the air yet?  No, nothing. 
[02:28:30]  No care.  Zero care.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got something right here.  Indifference.  There it is.  More indifference.  You're going to kill me.  They're going to kill me.  Well, Cheryl.  Thanks for calling in.  Hey, when is the show on? 
[02:29:00]  Tonight.  Yeah, it's on tonight at 8 on CBS, right?  Tonight at 8 o'clock.  Hey, Cheryl, happy birthday.  Thank you so much.  Another year over.  I've got to come out there and meet you guys.  Absolutely.  One year closer to 50.  Bring your daughters.  Do you like bowling?  Yeah.  Older, wiser, and better.  How about a threesome with your daughters?  Oh, God.  I don't think so.  Paul.  Now, that was Paul. 
[02:29:30]  That was Anthony.  That was Anthony.  He really will not be welcomed back to this program after that remark, Cheryl.  I know.  I know.  Exactly.  I apologize.  I'm sorry, Cheryl.  Now, where did Paul come from?  Is he the one trying to shove the chair?  No, I was raised by a pack of wolves.  What do you mean, where did I come from?  I don't know.  Where did I come from?  What does that mean?  You come from a wolf.  I don't know.  I, um...  Wow.  Cool, Cheryl.  This was all right.  You were on a show, right? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  And it was pretty much like a game show.  Would you do it again?  We play games on this show, too.  What are you people?  On soap?  What would you do differently on the show?  Um...  Shut up.  Depends on who's on there.  This group was really interesting.  Give us an answer.  Who cares who's on there?  Is it safe?  Shut up.  Yeah, it was safe.  Shut up.  It was safe.  Was it safe, really?  It was crazy.  It was wild.  We all, uh...  Is it safe? 
[02:30:30]  We jumped in hot tubs.  We...  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  The point is, it was fun.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Oh, wow.  Shut up, Demi.  Well, Cheryl, are you going to get to New York, you think?  Or...  Oh, yeah.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Would you like to go out or something?  Yeah.  Hang the phone up, you skank.

We're having a party to watch it at my place.  Hey, your favorite singer is Liza Minnelli, huh?  No.  Is it really?  Because I'll have you sterilized.  Seriously.  No, it's definitely not.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Someone wants you to hang the phone up.  I don't know who that is.  Who's that?  Andrew Dice Clay.  Hey, this is a little strange. 
[02:32:00]  Least favorite movie, Half Baked.  Half Baked?  Already got fingered.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Did Brewer Delayed Reaction finger to Oprah?  Right, they gave me the finger.  An artistic kid that snapped out of his coma for a minute.  All right.  Well, Cheryl, this has been a lot of fun, and happy birthday.  Thank you so much.  Doing anything fun for your birthday today?  No, not really. 
[02:32:30]  I just went to work for a little bit, so now I'm on my way home, and we'll see what happens  there.  Is your husband going to, you know, take care of you?  I have one of those.  Oh, you don't?  Oh, you're a divorced mom.  Yeah.  Oh, when did he leave you?  No, I left him about two years ago.  You left him?  Yeah.  What happened? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, what happened to the marriage?  Not enough action.  He liked your dumpier.  He wouldn't put it in the dumpier.  There he goes again.  There's a long drag ball that he flips center field, bounces off his testicles.  Oh, that's what it means.  Look in and run, picks up the ball, throws it, smack right in her vagina.  There goes, please.  This is, um, I think we have some audio of her husband, uh, right before he was kicked  down.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Wow.  That must have angered you. 
[02:33:30]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  How kinky would you get with your husband?  Oh, gosh.  Could you shut up?  It just didn't happen.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hey.  I'm sorry.  Uh, we didn't realize Dice was coming in today.  A poosah!  Sometimes I wish he just had a big old penis and teeth. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, that would have worked in the house.  Quiet.  Oh, yeah, that, the house again.  That house.  Shut up, dummy.  Well, Cheryl, I think this went, uh, quite well.  Yeah, I, I, I, I learned a lot.  Yeah, how many, uh, radio interviews have you done?  Oh, about, uh, 16.  Really?  You'll, you'll remember this one.  What?  Yeah, I'll never forget this one.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I think I'm, no, no care. 
[02:34:30]  This one has just been, like.  It's just a long drive.  Unbelievable.  Way back.  Yeah.  All right.  Off the wall.  Well, why don't we, uh, let Cheryl go.  Cheryl, we're going to miss you.  Yeah, Cheryl, if you'd come to New York, please hang with us.  You're fine.  Yeah, I'm going to come hang with you.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 horn.

You ever do the thing where one of your pals is sitting there, you got the jeans on, and  you take your Bic lighter, and you just turn the gas on, and you hold it on their legs  so the gas builds up in the material, and then you light it.  Maybe we can go bowling or something.  Ow!  What are you doing, Dick?  Yeah, that's when you put the flame on their back pocket.

No, no, no.  You pick them up, and one guy picks them up, and you hold on to it, and the guy goes about  40 miles an hour, and then you just let it fly.  You just sit and bounce down the road.  20 blocks.  But bing, but bing.  Then, of course, there's always a rock through the windshield, which always gets a lot of the  anxiety.

[02:43:30]  Keep it going.  The whooping monkeys.  Why the hell are whooping monkeys so goddamn funny?  Isn't whooping monkey just dead?  Johnny, the whooping monkey is endangered in several continents.  The whooping monkey just threw feces at me.  Feces, Johnny.  Johnny, he's going to bring out whooping monkeys. 
[02:44:00]  These whooping monkeys.  Whooping monkeys.  Johnny, Johnny.  Now, you'll notice he likes to burrow into my crotch.  There's your problem with the whooping monkey.  That's because I smeared Fluff-a-Nutter in there.  Well, that's what Doc Severnson does to me.  Oh, Doc.  Whooping monkey, shut up.  I'm hungover.  Hell.  Also, in the crease of my ass, big attraction to Hellman's Light.  Don't know why.  Yes, you have quite dust-doomper. 
[02:44:30]  Whooping monkeys on the show today, Ed.  Whooping monkeys.  I slept with one in a drunken stupor last night, Johnny.  Hi-oh.  Boy, can they polish your knob.  Doc Severnson, what a faggot.  Nice suit.  Charles Nelson Riley called.  He wants it back.  Oh, how's that for a topper?  Oh, how's that for a topper? 
[02:45:00]  Look, Doc Severnson, he's having a whooping monkey.  Hi-oh.  Hi-oh.  Here's another scotch, Johnny, you're told.  Freddy the Quarter for being humped by a whooping monkey.  Stay tuned as the mighty Carson art players have sex with whooping monkeys.  We have a baking segment with whooping monkeys. 
[02:45:30]  Scream on the monkeys.  Scream on the monkeys.  Scream on the monkeys.  Scream on the monkeys.  Oh, my God.  What the hell is happening here today?  Seems the whooping monkeys have taken over the audience, Ed.  And there's a long drive.  All-deeds on the field bounces off the African-American.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, Anthony, I think someone's going for the old sweet tart tape to the van.  You've got two more.  Yes.  Nice job.  Good callback, man.  Hey, Elmo Bob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Man, I've been listening to you since the first day.  Keep up the good work.  Nice.  Listen, I just wanted to let you know what I learned today.  Oh, yeah, we can start that.  Wow.  Okay.  Patch, not marijuana, is the bomb.  And I've got a little something for Brewer.  How you doing, Brewer?  Good.  You were talking about Nina Blackwood before. 
[02:46:30]  MTV girl?  Yeah.  She is probably on Celebrity Skin online.  And there's a great picture of her.  Of her legs.  She's sitting down.  She's shaped in a V.  And she's got nothing but that special slice.  I'd rather hear whooping.  You've got to talk to her.  The Indian babble of this man.  Oh, is that it?  Let's see Nina Blackwood.  She has dark hair now.  Give me the picture.  Someone see?  Someone really found her?  Looks like a Montana crutch rat. 
[02:47:00]  Let me see that.  That's her?  I don't know.  Let me see.  Let me see.  That there looks like a Montana crutch rat.  Take a look, Ed.  A Montana crutch rat.  Yeah, that's her when she was hot.  During the mating season, the Montana crutch rat.  They mate with whooping monkeys.  Lucy, you ain't nothing but a darn Montana.  Oh, that is so touch stuff.  Yeah, something's wrong with that picture.  That is so touch stuff.  But it's kind of hot.  You know what?  They should have taken her walker out of the picture. 
[02:47:30]  We need to take a break.  All right.  And then we can come back and play.  Glaze her like a donut.  Yeah.  Nice.  I'm going to get glazed.  Glaze.  Everyone sticking around for the last segment?  Now, Ed's going to do a Purina commercial from the stage.  A Purina dog butt.  Look at the end of a bitchy, Johnny.  He's mounting me.  Look at him.  His hair is getting caught in my back hair.  I don't know what to do next.  I'm going to marry him.  That faggot duck is having sex with a chihuahua. 
[02:48:00]  He's making his eyes bulge even more than usual.  I did not know that.  We will take a break.  And we'll come back with what did we learn on the show.  What an educational show.  And, of course, Tommy Newsom will be here.  Hey, Tommy fell asleep and Ed had sex with him.  Look, we have a still pic of Ed teabagging Tommy Newsom.  Ed is teabagging Tommy's beige sport jacket.  His leisure wear.  Scotch dripping from his yam bag. 
[02:48:30]  We have the 100 grand clip, Anthony.  All right.  Give me a few requests for the new cities.  The time we gave away 100 grand on the O.P. and Anthony show.  That was a few years back, Jim.  It was a touching moment.  Hi.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham.  Hey, Craig.  Guess what?  Did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  Get out of the way.  I won.  I won.  I won.  No way.  You're kidding, right?  107th. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, wow.  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand.  Oh, my God.  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Man, the first thing, I have this old, oh, I cannot, jeez, I've got to calm down.  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner.  I'm the winner.  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand?  I got this, oh, man, I got this shit box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one.  A new truck.  Oh, that, oh.  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar? 
[02:49:30]  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey, what the f*** you been saying?  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man.  You said 100 grand.  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy.  Oh, you guys are a bunch of dudes.  Hey, hey, hey.  Congratulations, man.  Uh-oh. 
[02:50:00]  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, buddy.  Ah, Anthony.  Tiger Shulman Karate.  Ever thought it would be cool to get into karate?  Fantasize about what it would be like to kick someone's ass?  Yeah, it's good to know karate, but for some reason you just haven't taken the time to do it.  Here's a reason to do it now.  Tiger Shulman Karate celebrating its 18th anniversary.  They're inviting you to take karate for free this summer when you enroll in the beginner program. 
[02:50:30]  Here's why it's good to know karate.  You work and define muscles you didn't even know you had.  In addition to an amazing workout, you develop skills that you'll have for the rest of your life,  and you're going to have the confidence of knowing you can defend yourself in any situation.  That's pretty cool.  And your kids, kids who take karate, have greater self-confidence and do better at school.  But don't take my word for it.  Go find out for yourself.  Call up 1-800-52-TIGER.  Join Tiger Shulman Karate today and take karate for free this summer. 
[02:51:00]  Call them up 1-800-52-TIGER.  Get all the details.  Call now.  Anniversary special expires July 21st.  1-800-52-TIGER.  It's really cool to beat up.  If you know karate, and you ever see a drunk guy get beat up by a guy who does karate?  It's pretty sad.  I'm going to assume it's a slow beating.  Because a guy would, like, kick him and, like, throw him.  Hey, what are you doing, man?  He doesn't even know he's hit yet.  Faggot?  Don't kick? 
[02:51:30]  Tiger Shulman Karate.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  7-W-N-E-W.  Man, just a few minutes left in the show today, Ann.  Yeah.  I'm going to play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  866-2774.  Wow.  What a blast today.  My God.  And if you're listening in New York, 877-692-1027.  Definitely want to thank Paul Mercurio for stopping by. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Where's your plug?  July 23rd at Carolinas, right?  Yeah, Monday, headlining at Carolinas.  Come on out.  Very, very good.  Yeah, his stuff is great.  Thanks.  Seriously.  We've seen you a bunch of times.  And, of course, Jim.  We've seen you many times.  And, of course, Jim Brewer.  What can we say, man?  Thanks for letting me hang.  Oh, please.  Anytime.  You know that.  Yeah, good.  Nice.  I got some meetings.  I hope she didn't turn on the radio.  I'm busy.  She never does.  No radio.  I'm busy.  I got to do it.  I got to edit. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, what is that coming out?  A lot of people are asking.  It's almost done.  Are you doing a CD?  No, I did a concert film.  I did a concert film.  At Irving Plaza.  It's almost done.  We're doing the sound tomorrow.  Nice.  And so it should be done in like a week or two.  Cool.  A lot of cool behind-the-scenes stuff.  Cool stuff.  A lot of stuff in this.  A lot of incriminating stuff that might have been set up in Boston.  A lot of fun stuff.  Drunk and back out.  All drunk in Boston.  Here's your little go-play games, all right?  You get to see Jim backstage screaming at his manager because the steamer isn't there to get the crease out of his pants. 
[02:53:00]  There's a crease in my pants.  I think you'll see more of us running out of an alley with a joint because tourists started walking down.  Like one in the morning in Boston.  Every tourist, man.  Dude, you could smoke a joint right here.  No one's going to bother you.  There's a rumor.  There's a section where you and I are kind of interviewing Brewer.  Which one?  Which one?  We're drunk in that bar.  Yes.  But if you don't understand, it doesn't have to be there. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, no.  We don't care.  Brewer, we don't care.  I think it's hysterical.  It's hilarious because we're completely hammered.  You don't want to do anything that steps on Anthony's quote in time.  You don't want to mar that.  Oh, my God.  You were playing Boston at the Comedy Connection.  It was like 2 in the morning.  The bars closed at 1.  They kept the bar open for us.  We're hammered.  And asking Brewer about his SNL days.  He just would not hold back at all.  Yeah.  He's like, I don't know. 
[02:54:00]  Someday I'll tell you about this.  You know who the biggest dick was?  Yeah, that was pretty good.  They brought in Lazy Boys.  Everybody relax.  I'll be told them all.  Pretty much, man.  We were wrecked, man.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Is he saying that?  D-I-C, Calvin, okay, dick.  Calvin, monkey.  No, you're dick.  That's what it is.  Okay.  Yeah, I remember that night well.  I went off.

You guys suck.  What was that, Christy and Ashley?  Yeah.  Christy and Ashley are our little 18-year-old girlfriends from Dallas.  So you're a virgin?  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Bill.  We're a howling monkey. 
[02:55:00]  Hey, Bill, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that, Ed.  Christy's the prist and Ashley's the goer.  Right.  Yeah.  We learned that, too.  Nice show, Deke.

Yeah, we're on Fox News tonight, 10 o'clock news.  Wow. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, that's great.  You're going to get the 60-year-olds watching you.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, today I learned from Time Magazine that O&A is just a talk show about boobs.  Yeah.  That's all we do, obviously.  Did you take a hit of helium?  Yeah, what happened?  Go watch this.  I'm going to sing a song on the helium.  It's going to be great.  Yeah, E.G. Marshall.  See, I'm coming at you.  Wait a minute.  I got it.

I also learned that it rhymes like bigger.  Peace out.  All right, bye.  Wow.  See, here's the problem with them.  First of all, they're lazy.  You got to iron your sheets before you go out for the cross burning.  They're lazy.  Lisa, can you get me a beer?  Jeez.  Doug.  It's right there in your...  Hey, Doug.  Doug.  Yeah.  What's up?

We're now going to bring out the red-assed baboon.  I love the red-assed mandrel, isn't it, Adam?  Oh, no. 
[02:58:00]  What part of the jungle is this now?  Oh, who cares, Johnny?  That ass looks like the same color red in Doc Severinsen's suit.  Yes, the suit is red.  I slept with it last night.  Like a big man.  I humped it.  It made me red.  My shaft was red.  It reminds me of when I was hanging out with Chuck Heston.  What in the hell? 
[02:58:30]  Smells like cat food and acid.  Well, is Danny Thomas here?  Will someone please take a dump on a plate glass coffee table?  Yes, Danny might have been into that.  Danny liked the dump.  The Cleveland steamer on the plate glass.  Who doesn't, Johnny?  No.  Marlo in Connecticut, if you're listening, call in.  We want to talk about your father's fetishes.  We got to leave.  We got to leave.  Yeah, look at the time, man.  You got to get out of here.  Let's go with that.  Jim Brewer, go have fun at the Shea Stadium.  That game.
