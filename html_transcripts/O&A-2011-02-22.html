<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, grappling with technical microphone issues, their frustration punctuated by vulgar language and exaggerated complaints. This segued into a discussion of a news story linking oral sex to increased oral cancer rates in white men, sparking a crude and racially charged debate about oral sex practices across different racial groups.  Mars, a Hispanic staff member, was briefly involved, adding to the already provocative conversation. The discussion then shifted to the causes of oral cancer, veering from the news story to theories about tobacco use, all within a framework of offensive jokes and racist stereotypes.

Comedian Patrice O'Neal joined the show, receiving congratulations for his successful stand-up special and appearances on *Jimmy Fallon*.  The conversation moved to O'Neal's *Fallon* experience, including jokes cut from the broadcast, particularly one referencing Obama.  The final major topic of this segment was the surprisingly high cost of maintaining the White House, as highlighted by a History Channel documentary.  The hosts reacted with exaggerated outrage and vulgar language, speculating about potential uprisings and revolutions, drawing parallels to events in Egypt and Libya, and weaving in dark humor and conspiracy theories.  The segment concluded with further off-color jokes and banter.

The next segment began with a discussion about societal apathy towards current events, using the example of unnoticed environmental disasters. This transitioned to the political situation in the Middle East, focusing on Muammar Gaddafi and his son, described as "an evil mother," and the hosts suggesting that entertainment could mitigate the dangers of their regime's downfall. The conversation then turned to racial issues and surveillance within American society, followed by a cynical discussion of the "golden throat homeless guy" and the media's exploitation of his situation.  They detailed his relapse into homelessness and his mother's reaction using offensive language.  The conversation then returned to Patrice O'Neal's Comedy Central special, "Elephant in the Room," discussing its reception, title, and the network's brief channel guide listing.  A significant portion focused on a critique of the NBA All-Star Weekend dunk contest, comparing it unfavorably to past contests.  A video of Spud Webb seemingly dunking at an older age was shown and revealed to be a trick shot. The segment concluded with a discussion of the Carmelo Anthony trade, criticism of the Steinbrenner family and their treatment of Derek Jeter, and a debate on the easiest jobs in baseball history, ultimately deciding on Herb Washington's role as a pinch runner. A brief discussion of aging celebrities' balding heads also occurred.

The following segment focused on hair transplants.  The hosts and Patrice O'Neal discussed hair loss, hair systems, and cosmetic procedures, with one host graphically detailing his hair transplant experience, including the pain and cost ($12,000).  They compared modern techniques to older methods and mentioned several celebrities who have had transplants (Jamie Foxx, Kenny Rogers, Pat O'Brien).  Patrice O'Neal's new comedy DVD was heavily promoted, along with an anecdote about a harsh interaction with an audience member.  The conversation shifted to Patrice's views on men's lack of concern for their partners' health, a topic also featured on his DVD. Kurt Metzger was mentioned as an upcoming guest.  The hosts then discussed the stand-up comedy scene, criticizing younger comedians' perceived lack of struggle and comparing them to older generations.  A lengthy and often offensive discussion about comedians with physical disabilities followed, with several specific examples and opinions given. The segment ended with further promotion of Patrice O'Neal's DVD.

The next segment centered on the hosts' reactions to stand-up comedy clips featuring comedians with disabilities, specifically a deaf comedian and Nikki Payne (who has a cleft palate).  The hosts used highly offensive language to describe the comedians and their performances, offering harsh criticism and mockery.  The discussion then shifted to the nature of comedy and the “trial by fire” necessary to succeed, contrasting the comedians' perceived inability to handle criticism with the hosts' own style.  Other comedians mentioned included Louie Anderson and Sean Rouse.  A documentary about a dysfunctional West Virginia family was shown, along with clips of Jimmy the Greek and Hulk Hogan making controversial statements.  The hosts discussed the changing landscape of acceptable language and the controversy surrounding racial slurs.  The segment concluded with Kurt Metzger promoting his appearances and *Ugly Americans*, and the hosts promoting their "Car Crash Comedy" event.

The final segment focused on the hosts' experiences with Twitter and its users, contrasting the anonymous harassment they received through letters with the readily available insults on Twitter.  They discussed their methods of dealing with negative tweets, ranging from ignoring users to directly insulting them, sometimes using racial slurs.  The concept of a “Pardon Day” for blocked users was introduced.  The conversation touched on stand-up comedy, using Ricky Gervais's Golden Globes routine as an example.  A lengthy anecdote about a disastrous wedding-related pilot with Patrice O'Neal was shared.  Kurt Metzger was mentioned and his shows promoted. The show concluded with a "Black Tweet of the Day" segment for Black History Month.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now. 
[00:00:30]  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  The crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  Jesus.  Morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, let me just...  Funny, funny.  How to adjust these new...  They're brand new, right?  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Not mine?  Really?  Check, check, check.  It sounds a little different.  It does, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That's why I said I must have brand new headphones, because they sound different.  Mars.  But it's...  In like five minutes, it won't matter. 
[00:01:30]  But right away, you're just kind of like, that's a little different.  His mic sounds really bad.  Does it?  Yeah, it sounds very...  Like a...  Tinny.  Tinny.  Yeah, a little flat.  A little flat.  A little flat.  A little flat.  I could definitely, yeah, notice that.  That's punishment for taking off yesterday.  Just flatten my mic out.  Don't do that again.  Never do that again.  Well, the radio guys are really, really anal retentive.  Oh, yeah.  As far as what it sounds like in the headphones.  And if it's slightly off, it drives you nuts. 
[00:02:00]  You're like, ah, what happened?  Something changed.  Wait, listen, listen.  Your mic is horrible.  Distortion.  Horrible.  Distortion.  What happened here yesterday?  Hey, distortion.  Distortion and very, very flat.  Meh.  I can't get anything out of it.  Watch when I yell.  What the hell is...  Obama!  Obama!  See?  See, it's doing something.  Oh, oh.  Oh, a little gain.  What is that?  He did a little gain.  A little gain on me?  A dig gain.  Hey, hi.  What's a dig gain?  What is dig gain? 
[00:02:30]  Digital?  Oh, dig gain.  Keep going.  I dig that gain.  Yeah.  How's that?  Yeah, that's...  Wow.  Oh, God.  Listen, how's all the...  Hey, everybody!  It's too early for that shit.  I could give you this.  Go ahead, yeah.  All right.  Let's try this one.  Oh, this is perfect.  I like this.  This is how it should be right here.  Right here.  Hey, I'm stuck in the well.  I'm stuck in the well.  This is exactly how it should be right here.  Yeah, I'll just be like, hey, uh...  I go home with a sore throat every night. 
[00:03:00]  All right, this is what I'm going to do for now on.  All right.  You need to be right around.  All right.  All right.  Start talking like, um...  Start talking about, uh, Obama or something in Texas.  All right, well, uh...  No, start with something like, you know...  Start with, um, eating pussy or something.  Oh, my God.  Uh, did you read the story about the, uh, pussy eating, uh, can give you oral cancer?  I sure did, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  And, uh, if you notice, the prime victim in all this are white men. 
[00:03:30]  Of course.  Which just...  I mean, if there's ever been a stereotype, uh, where, where, um...  By the way, you're blowing my bit, because now we're just doing regular radio.  Yeah, I know.  I wanted you to do, like, Obama tax shit.  So I could...  Yeah, all right.  Like, just say into taxes somehow.  All right.  Uh, you know something, uh, April, uh, tax time's coming up.  I hope everybody's got their checkbooks out, because, uh, a lot of people, they're, uh...  You know what they're doing now?  They are, uh, uh, paying taxes when they used to get a refund. 
[00:04:00]  And now, it's, it's out of hand.  Back to pussy.  And I...  Notice black men aren't on that list.  On what list?  Because they don't eat the coochie.  The, uh, the eating pussy, uh, uh, uh, cancer mouth list.  All right, we got...  Your mic's perfect.  You need a lot more gain for something.  For some reason.  I don't know.  The mic must be fucked up.  It's probably a switch on the mic.  Oh, no.  These are, like, mics I used to use. 
[00:04:30]  It's like a Mr. Microphone.  Yeah, I...  Why aren't they radio mics?  These can't be expensive, are they?  Yeah.  These are expensive mics?  $600.  Huh?  $600.  That's not expensive for a radio mic.  That's not expensive.  $600?  These should be $1,200 microphones.  We laugh at $600, Mars.  Okay.  What about the big ones?  Did you ever watch...  There's a fucking...  Oh, there's a show, hold on, that has, like, really good mics?  Oh, that's right.  Live from the compound.  You ever see it?  They're quality fucking microphones. 
[00:05:00]  Are they...  Can't we have them here at work?  Are they more than $600?  Yeah, they're the radio microphones that you see in every radio station because they work.  Is it safe to say that your studio is more expensive than this studio?  Yes!  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I have more computers.  Oh, my God.  Great microphones.  Well, you, uh...  That's a microphone.  Yeah, oral sex linked to increasing cancer rates.  And it's happening with white men.  This is hilarious.  White men.  Uh, boy.  Patrice O'Neal's going to be in here again today. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  By the way, his special was amazing.  Oh, yeah.  The feedback on it was unbelievable, and hopefully it leads to better things for Patrice.  But, yeah, we'll talk to him about it.  The black guys, in general, don't eat the pussy.  It's kind of been the stereotype over the years.  People have known that black guys do not enjoy eating pussy, and it is a white guy kind of thing to do.  I don't know.  Are Asians into it?  Uh, that's a really good question.  I don't know.  You know, the black guys supposedly don't.  White guys definitely do.  Um, Hispanic.  Hispanic.  White guys.  I don't know if Hispanic does it. 
[00:06:00]  I think Spanish guys are all about the car wash.  Just everything.  Oh, everything down there?  Just everything.  The big Latina booty?  Yeah, they're just all over.  We got Mars in here.  We could ask him.  Oh, let's ask Mars.  Mars is, uh, Hispanic.  Sorry, he's done for the day.  Here he comes.  Oh, here he comes.  Here he comes.  He did his 15 minutes.  He's running in.  Mars, uh, did you hear the story?  The white guys get mouth cancer from eating pussy.  They say that human papillomavirus gives you the mouth cancer. 
[00:06:30]  If you like eating the pussy and you eat a lot of pussy.  Um, we, we know blacks aren't getting this.  Right.  Because it's, uh, everybody knows black guys don't eat pussy.  They don't like it for the, you know, majority.  Uh, Hispanic men.  We eat it all.  All of it.  You do, right?  I, I, I knew that.  The booty, the big Latina booty.  Booty, including the fucking, uh.  The smelly taint.  You just go.  The fucking, that time of the month.  Really?  Yeah, not me, but.  What?  All right, he says not him.  So now we're looking for him for an example. 
[00:07:00]  And he says, well, yeah, they do, but not me.  Wait, you're representing the Latinos out there.  And you're saying they go down even when they're having their periods?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  As long as you don't poke the hoe, you know, just lick the clit.  You're straight.  What's that, what's that called in Spanish?  Sangria?  Sangria.  Is that sangria?  What do they call that?  Wow, really?  Yes.  Oh, wow, that's rough.  That is, uh.  That's a rough one.  That's a rough one.  I understand if you stay in the area, you'll be fine. 
[00:07:30]  But that's taking too many chances.  There's keeping your head above a certain level when that's going on.  Yeah, you've got to keep your head above the Red Sea.  Yeah, yeah.  Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba.  You've got to stay out of the red zone.  So it's everything.  We call it the car wash.  You're just all in.  All in.  All right.  I mean, white guys, you know, we venture.  White guys are also into, like, just shoving tongue in and.  Stabbing it.  Uh, yeah.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  How's that feel? 
[00:08:00]  And they just wind up getting these fucking mouth cancer.  That's probably why.  Because we're just not doing it right.  Yeah.  Uh, boy.  You know who could eat pussy?  Who?  Roger Ebert.  Oh, shit.  That motherfucker.  Could he eat pussy in his day, I bet.  Oh, shit.  The king of pussy.  And now the king of no jaw.  No.  Oh, that's great.  What are people going down on their chicks eating some skull?  Copenhagen or Happy Days? 
[00:08:30]  Do they put a pinch between their cheek and gum and then start licking clit?  You, I, I, you, you taught me about stats a long time ago.  I think this is bullshit.  Come on.  Really?  Do you see white guys walking around with fucking mouth cancer in general?  Here and there.  Uh.  But usually, you talk to them a little bit and you find out they were chewing.  Chew.  A little dip, as they say.  If you're dipping, that's, that's like, that's like, uh, the easy path to the cancer.  Oh, yeah.  Smoking, it's, it's, it could go either way, but it seems like if you were chewing back in  the day, you got problems when you get a little older. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Tobacco use remains the leading cause of oral cancer.  There it is.  Okay.  And then you're getting some cancer from the, uh, from, uh, eating the puss.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Oh.  Well, researchers found a 225% increase in oral cancer cases in the U.S. from 1974 to  2007, mainly among white men.  White men.  Now, that could have been like five white men had it from eating pussy.  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh, you know, 15 or 20 get it, and it's a huge increase, but in the scheme of 
[00:09:30]  things, it's not a lot of people.  Do you know one person with mouth cancer in your, in your, you know, in your, uh, in your  circle?  In your circles, uh, no, I gotta say, uh, knock, knock, uh, wood.  No.  And all those, and all those white guys are eating pussy, so.  Eating that pussy.  So what's going on?  I don't know.  Um, I would assume my uncles were eating some pussy in their day, and they all don't have  the mouth cancer.  They're getting up there.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Mine was, you know, Italian, older Italian guys. 
[00:10:00]  Old Italian guys.  Do the old Italian guys eat the puss?  Remember the Sopranos when Uncle June fucking went to eat the pussy?  Uh, he was looked at.  He said, you keep this quiet.  He didn't, he didn't want everybody to know, and he ate the pussy because it's a sign of  weak, weakness.  But, um.  How is that weakness?  But not this generation.  It's calling you.  Now Italians, uh, just dig in like.  But the old school.  Like it's a gabagol.  The old school Italians didn't?  No, no.  I didn't know that.  They, uh.  I think they did, but they tried to hide it. 
[00:10:30]  Like they'd never, they'd never fess up to it.  Well, they didn't like do it with their wife, but with their little side piece.  With their guma.  With their guma.  You get your guma.  And, uh.  You gotta think they were eating the guma's pussy.  Yeah.  And lick it up.  Oh, like some fucking, uh, like a gabagol.  Or like a fucking, uh, uh, gaga gal.  Calamar.  Calamar.  Like some fresh calamar.  Well, calamar is a little rough, though.  Yeah, you don't want to smell like calamar.  You don't want to go down and find some calamar.  No.  It's a little chewy, and it's a little, uh. 
[00:11:00]  It's a little gamey.  A little gamey.  A little fishy sometimes, like rubber bands.  Yes.  Yeah, you want.  You don't want that.  No.  You want it to bounce back nice.  Yeah.  Not with a slight hesitation before it bounces back.  You know what my conclusion is on this whole thing?  What?  Uh.  Girls, uh, pussies are just dirty fucking germ factories.  Their vaginas are horrid little germ factories.  What's, what's on their puss that is giving us fucking, uh, oral cancer? 
[00:11:30]  It's that fucking, uh, fucking PVC.  That plastic stuff.  No, it's HPV.  Human papilloma.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Isn't that what they do?  The running of the bulls?  And the papillona.  The HPV.  HPV.  They get that, right?  And then that increases their chance for getting cancer.  Although, I think every chick has that, but like, yeah, see, sometimes it like goes,  it goes rogue on them.  It goes rogue. 
[00:12:00]  In general, it's dormant.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  It's like, it just hangs out there.  Every once in a while, it peeks, uh, it peeks its head out or something.  Yeah, yeah.  It rears its ugly head.  And that fucking thing goes on your tongue, and then you got mouth cancer?  How does this work?  But then you could get the virus in your mouth, I guess, and then it could linger and just  do nothing.  Right.  Or it could, you know, next thing you know, you're Robert Ebert with a, or, uh, what's  his name?  With a fucking...  Ebert.  Yeah, Ebert with a snap-on jaw.  Yeah, yeah.  Roger.  Roger Ebert.  Roger.  With a snap-on jaw.  All right, we don't need to see fucking pictures of what could happen. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, God, I want to see that.  Ow.  Uh, black guy.  Oh, we do eat the pussy.  We started late, though.  Uh, let's go to Corey in Atlanta.  Corey.  All right, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hey, Om.  Hey, uh, the black guys, yeah, we eat pussy, man.  We just started a little bit later than you guys, man.  Around 95, 96 is when...  When you finally...  Is this a black history moment?  And then in 1995, African Americans started enjoying pussy. 
[00:13:00]  It was a great day.  I have seen the clitoris.  Right.  That is good.  I love that.  Back in 95, 96.  All right, punch it out.  Wait, no, don't punch out.  What happened in 95 or 96 that made all the black guys go, you know, it's time to eat the pussy?  And, uh, from the words of the old Negro spiritual, pussy at last, pussy at last, thank God almighty, I'm eating pussy at last. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, Opie, I think what happened is, uh, like, you had a rapper started talking about it, and you know how black people like to follow the rapper, so...  Yeah, you guys can't do anything on your own, you gotta wait for a rapper to tell ya.  Exactly, exactly.  The fuck?  But you'd be here with one of your bitches.  Yeah.  What rapper?  What rapper started the black guys eating the pussy?  Yeah, good one.  Now I need to learn something today.  Lil Wayne, motherfucker?  Lil Wayne!  No? 
[00:14:00]  It was Trick Daddy.  Uh, Trick Daddy?  Yeah.  Trick Daddy got the black guys eating the pussy.  I'm talking about eating pussy.  Did you know this, Ed?  I didn't know this.  This is great for black history, Ed.  And you know what?  It makes complete sense.  I believe this guy.  Yeah.  So before that, no one was eating the pussy, and what was the problem?  The smell down there?  Uh, no, it was like Ant said, you know, it was like a sign of weakness, and if a guy was eating the pussy,  it was like, don't tell anybody, because that's fucking disgusting.  Corey, have you been with white girls? 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  Ah, damn it.  Can we be honest?  Have they filed charges?  Can we be honest with each other?  They smell different, don't they?  They do smell different.  All right, thank you.  Because if a white guy says that, forget it.  We're in trouble.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  There is a big difference.  But I've come close to a couple black girls, and the smell, I'm telling you, is really, really rough.  It's just different culturally?  I guess.  Is it diet, you think?  I don't know what it is.  I'm going to say it's diet and genetics. 
[00:15:00]  And genetics?  Diet and genetics, wow.  Because if you get a black chick and a white chick, they both eat the same thing.  The pussy's going to taste different.  I think it's got a lot to do with the pH.  The pH?  The pH, you've got to test it like a pool.  The pH is in water.  You've got to have the pool guy come in and make sure the pH is good.  But sometimes you've got to shock a pussy if it's turning green from algae.  You've got to use a litmus strip.  Yeah.  Give me a litmus strip.  I need to know.  I think this is too acidic. 
[00:15:30]  Did we not just find our next bit?  We've got to put some baking soda in there.  Can we get some pussies in here and do some fucking testing?  Do some testing.  Some fucking litmus paper.  And another little tidbit, black women started admitting to getting on the mic around 2000,  2002 or something like that.  Really?  That they've been going down on guys?  Right.  Yeah, they've been doing it.  They just didn't want to be seen as a whore. 
[00:16:00]  I ain't doing that.  Right.  I ain't no whore.  Well, that's why the black guys found the big fat white girls, right?  Yeah, because they loved just sucking dick.  Yeah.  They tried real hard.  Imagine that.  The black guy just laying back first time with a big fat white chick and he's just like,  what the fuck is she doing?  Yeah.  Holy motherfucker.  And she just starts sucking that dick.  That was my initial lure for getting with a white chick because, you know, it was known  that all the white chicks love to suck the dick. 
[00:16:30]  Wow.  And you wanted to have a little of that, huh?  All right.  Yeah, I really wanted that.  Where do you find a good coal burner these days?  Hey, shit.  All right, Corey.  I remember you, man.  You call every once in a while.  Hey, by the way, Augusta, is that a shitty area?  As far as what? 
[00:17:00]  Well, I'm going to go to the golf course.  Not golf.  I'm going to be doing a very white thing.  I'm thinking of checking out the Masters this year, finally.  Yeah, just stay around the golf course as soon as you leave from around there.  That's what I heard because I'm trying to look at hotels and they're all shitty hotels  in the area.  So they have this amazing golf course and I guess it's in a really bad neighborhood.  Do you know what Negroes can do to a golf course?  And how far is it from downtown?  Because I might have to go see my nephew.  Uh-oh.  From downtown Augusta, the golf course is probably maybe an hour. 
[00:17:30]  Okay.  Thank you.  Look, I'm using this as a personal little thing.  The radio show.  If you want a hint of what you'll have to contend with, just watch some of the Libyan footage.  All right.  No kidding.  And that'll be your drive to see.  That's actually people trying to get into Augusta.  Yeah, sometimes it's very good.  We mixed up the tape.  We're sorry about that.  We'll get to the Libyan tape.  That was Augusta.  Yeah, we want to start with the pussy eating because that Libyan situation is just ugly.  Yeah, that's somebody that's not going to go quietly. 
[00:18:00]  We want to start with something fun and happy like pussy eating.  Yes.  Holy shit.  Although it was pussy eating and cancer in the mouth, so not very happy.  But happier than the Libyan thing.  Yeah.  All right, Corey.  Thank you, brother.  All right.  Thanks, my God.  Let's go to Rochester because Brian does have a very good observation.  Brian, go ahead.  Oh, Rochester.  First off, the Hispanics call it Montezuma's revenge.  Wait, isn't that diarrhea?  Yeah, we all know that is diarrhea.  I'm not feeling that joke.  You're laughing.  I'm trying to get us to laugh along, but I ain't feeling it. 
[00:18:30]  Anyway.  Okay.  Anywho, I think they do, since they ban smoking, more people get mouth cancer.  And mostly white people do chew.  Well, I like that you're bringing that up.  Well, a lot of hillbillies, yeah.  They're saying that oral cancer has gone up from 225% between the years 1974 and 2007.  Those are some major smoking years, 1974.  74 to 2007, yeah.  But 2007, we were already starting to ban it everywhere. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  So this is very confusing because you would think if they started banning smoking, less people  are smoking, so less people are getting mouth cancer.  So why are these numbers, you know, increased drastically?  And we'll see.  Smoking before 1974, forget it.  Yep.  Everybody was smoking.  Everybody.  Everyone.  Fucking women were smoking as they were delivering babies.  Pregnant.  The doctor's smoking, pulling it out.  Yeah.  He's got one eye shut.  The smoke is going into his eyes.  They're like, ah, push, push.  You think we're joking, but let's get an old timer on them. 
[00:19:30]  Tell me right now you were allowed to smoke in the delivery room.  In the airplanes, the smoking section in an airplane?  Right, right.  Really?  Yeah, that makes sense.  By the way, hold on two seconds, sir, because I want to bring up the point that Mayor Bloomberg,  I think today, is signing into law a whole new smoking thing.  It's going to take effect, I think, in 90 days.  With the beaches and the parks and stuff?  City parks, city beaches, the little walkway.  Right, like in Times Square, you know that whole big open thing in Times Square where  they close the street and open it up to public and put seats there? 
[00:20:00]  No smoking in there.  So he's really cracking down on this smoking thing.  I think that's completely ridiculous.  Are you going to feel full of trash?  Crazy.  You know, I think in our lifetime, you're going to see smoking pretty much illegal.  Yeah.  Yeah, unless you're just cowering in your own home looking out the window like a paranoid  crackhead.  Well, they'll probably figure out how to ban it in your own house somehow.  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right, Brian.  All right, thanks, guys.  Thanks, brother.  I'm drawing it.  I'm going to give you the info. 
[00:20:30]  People got a gust info.  That's fine.  We'll do that another day.  That's boring to the people.  Can you really get...  Yeah, man, we've talked about this.  Roberto in Arkansas.  We only learned this recently.  Yes, Roberto, you could get an STD for moral sex.  No, man, I'm...  And you could get cancer for moral sex, we're learning.  No, no, check it out, man.  Point blank, white chicks taste like bologna.  Black chicks taste like armpits.  And Mexican chicks or Hispanic chicks, whatever the fuck you want to call them, taste like 
[00:21:00]  pico de gala.  Hey, that's quite cool.  Come on.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We're going to ban the phones for 15 minutes.  That's one man's opinion.  Roberto.  What about the Asian guys?  That's the only reason we started going on the phones.  Yeah.  No Asians checking in?  What's their protocol?  Their pussy eating protocol?  It sounds like the Latinos are all in.  Yeah.  White guys in and sometimes all in, I would say.  What's that Kama Sutra book?  Shows any pussy eating or is it all fucking in weird positions? 
[00:21:30]  That's...  Makes you fucking and you look like hieroglyphics when you're doing it.  I don't get it.  Have you ever tried one of those weird positions?  No.  It's like any position you really got to study and then do it, it just looks uncomfortable.  And it's really awkward when you have to jump out of bed with a fucking cramp in your  leg and a boner.  Yeah, because you twisted yourself into a pretzel.  And all of a sudden your calf muscle goes and you're like, fuck.  Is this satisfying?  You're hopping around the bedroom with a fucking cramp and a boner. 
[00:22:00]  A cramp and a boner.  That's embarrassing.  As your boner goes away real quick because the cramp is just like on the top of your  mind.  So dumb.  You ever try one of the moves that take a lot of physical strength, but you've heard  about it and seen it on a porno or something and you go to try it and it's like, oh, this  is good.  Oh, I can't do this anymore.  Oh, this is a good one.  I think she's digging.  I'm exhausted.  I don't think you need more than six positions probably.  And that's maybe high. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  I can think one, two, three, at least four or five.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe throwing a six on a, on one of those.  You mix it up a little like.  One of those long Saturday nights.  Like a special.  Yeah.  Here's the special move.  I think.  You don't want to pull out a special move though because I would assume that your girl  would think you got it somewhere else.  It's like, hmm, he never used this one before.  Yeah, I guess.  What the fuck?  You got to be careful with that shit, I guess, right?  I guess.  I learned this one from an old German Scheiser video. 
[00:23:00]  All right, so enough about, uh, Asian guy.  Okay, finally.  Uh, Dave in New Mexico.  You're, you're not Asian if your name's Dave.  Maybe it's Dave in Chow.  Uh, what's your last name, Dave?  I'm in mom.  My dad's Swedish.  My mom's Korean.  We want, we want a hundred percent.  Eh, we could start out with half.  All right, you're half.  Maybe he just fucking licks labia.  Right. 
[00:23:30]  He doesn't go in too deep.  You go in all the way.  All the way in.  Yeah, a lot of Asians.  Fuck, I guess I'm the one.  You're half Asian, man.  Fuck, no, it don't fucking matter.  What?  It don't matter.  That's half Korean.  That's nothing.  Yeah.  We want like a, like a Chinese restaurant waiter.  Yeah.  We want a hardcore Asian, and I want to know what they're doing.  I want an Asian that gets on the phone when you order food, and you've got to give him  your address five times, and he still fucks it up. 
[00:24:00]  That's the Asians we need on the phone.  You would think it would be good for business to hire one guy that speaks English.  I never understood that.  Right.  Just one guy.  Ah.  What's up, Patrice O'Neal?  Patrice.  I was trying to sneak in.  There he is.  How do you get your sneak in?  He's like tiptoeing in.  How does Patrice sneak in anywhere, ever?  I'm waiting for the, yeah, there's no break, and I'm just going to...  I feel like I'm looking at a star today.  I was waiting for Fame to call, but...  Fame didn't call, huh?  I was waiting. 
[00:24:30]  I was waiting for Fame.  You said he was going to call, but Fame was going to call, but I saw him hanging out  with Blake Griffin.  I'm like, that piece of shit.  He told me.  Fame's got to call.  He told me he was going to call me.  He said, I said, I don't care.  Don't forget it.  I think we've known you for about 10 years now, and I feel like I'm looking at someone  famous.  No.  That was nice.  You had a lot of exposure last week, man.  You were in the paper a lot.  You were on the Jimmy Fallon.  The Jimmy Fallon set was really good, by the way.  Thank you.  Smooth.  You were very relaxed, and Fallon was digging you, and Questlove was digging you.  I like that.  Questlove is a fan, too. 
[00:25:00]  Like, he's a guy that already knew me and everything.  Yeah.  Because when I came out, he was playing a fucking creep.  Oh, shit.  And that means he was listening to the radio, because we were talking about that fucking  creep.  Yeah.  And I was like, that's fucking amazing.  He wouldn't know that, but...  Wait, wait.  I don't even know that.  You lost me.  We were talking about creep.  Like, we were talking about here, and I talked about it on the radio, like in San Francisco,  just talking about how wonderful, like how much creep touches white people's hearts somehow.  And we talked about it, and fucking... 
[00:25:30]  But I...  You know, he played it.  Yeah, yeah.  Because of him, at least.  But, um...  That means he knew.  He knew.  Oh, yeah.  Don't just pull that one out of your ass.  And, uh...  The best part of your Jimmy Fallon set was at the end, he starts plugging your specials,  like, yeah, that was six minutes!  That was six minutes!  It felt like the white boy was ripping you off.  That was six minutes!  Because I...  I...  They cut something out.  I was talking about Obama.  It went well.  Because I...  You did an Obama thing that didn't make...  Yeah, that didn't make TV. 
[00:26:00]  Well, it was...  Yeah, they cut it down.  I think they was probably like, hmm...  Oh, was it a hmm?  Well, no.  Or a time.  Because it was a hmm earlier.  I had finally beat the audience into knowing that it was just going to be uncomfortable.  So, you know, stop.  Because he did a good joke earlier about something.  They just went...  It was about the Westminster dog show.  And he goes, how did that come about?  In the 1800s, somebody was writing, you know what we need now?  First, we need to treat black people better.  But second, so we need dog shows. 
[00:26:30]  So, it was like...  It was a good joke.  Yeah, yeah.  A little edgy, you know, for that.  And the crowd was like, hmm...  Did you just go...  At that point, did you go, oh, boy.  Here we go.  I'm going to have to deal with these motherfuckers.  I'm just going to blast these fucking white people.  Because he has a politically...  He's very political.  But he's not...  It's not motivated.  Right.  He has a lot of black people.  And it's not fake black, because there's a lot of black people backstage.  Yeah.  So, he has a lot of minorities. 
[00:27:00]  Dude.  It's a totally different vibe than what you would see.  Yeah.  So, what was the Obama joke they didn't go with?  Well, it wasn't a joke.  He just said, so, what do you think about Obama?  I go, fine.  And he goes, you like his job he's doing?  I said, listen, frankly, I don't believe in the idea of the president anymore.  I said, but at this point, it's a tradition.  Like a turkey, right?  I said, if he was a boss, one day I would like to see a president go, I'm not going to  live in the White House.  I'm just going to stay in this condo in Connecticut.  If he's the boss. 
[00:27:30]  Like, fuck the White House.  I'm not going to live where you want me to live.  So, I said, look at your show.  I said, you're a boss.  There's not a Conan shit.  What if Conan left and you had to still have his shit?  This is the Jimmy Fallon show.  This is...  Right.  You rinsed Conan out of this motherfucker.  You don't slip into somebody else's shit like that.  You got to sleep in the presidential bed and watch all these other dead motherfuckers  staring at you all day.  You can't fucking repaint them shit. 
[00:28:00]  You can't...  It's a tradition.  Yeah, yeah.  You're actually allowed to redecorate all that crap.  Curtains?  Not crazy, though.  Not crazy.  Yeah.  You can't knock a wall out.  No.  I was telling you before the show, it's worth watching.  They're going to run it, I'm sure, a million times.  They did our show on the White House.  And why wouldn't you want to live there?  Fuck that.  They're at your beck and call, man.  Yeah, but so much.  And if you all of a sudden decide you want to be a swimming guy, they put a swimming pool in for  you in the back.  All right.  I mean, I can't...  One of the presidents, they gave him a putting green in an area where he could fucking hit 
[00:28:30]  some wedges.  I mean, Michelle has her fucking...  Obama got the basketball court.  And there was a bowling alley put in.  Bowling alley for somebody?  Yeah.  I mean...  It is crazy.  I was telling Ant, and I might have...  I was starting to get a little sleepy, so I'm not sure.  Maybe someone could back me up.  But supposedly, it's top secret how much money it costs to keep the White House running.  And there's estimates that it's over a billion dollars.  A year?  In what?  Well, that I don't know, because like I said, I was getting sleepy. 
[00:29:00]  Is that for his four-year term a billion dollars, or is that a year?  It's top secret shit, because you don't want the fucking public knowing how expensive it  is to run that place.  Yeah, to keep all the security.  So they've estimated that it's over a billion, but I'm not sure of the times for you.  It's not even that big of a match.  I would assume a year.  Fucking Torrey Spelling's father has a bigger house.  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  And I think those things cost two million a year to keep.  In a much better neighborhood.  Right.  But you got chefs, you got private functions, you got...  The security alone is crazy. 
[00:29:30]  You got security.  I think they're also talking about the helicopters landing on the lawn.  International Finance Service and General Government Appropriation Act of 2008 indicates  that the yearly operating expense for the White House is $12,814,000.  That is, that's a big fucking difference than what I saw last night.  $35,000 a day to run a household.  So, okay.  So, okay.  You're saying that now, right?  $12 million a year.  What I'm just saying... 
[00:30:00]  So we got to...  Hold on, hold on.  Because it's going to take time.  If they can find it down the hall.  History Channel last night, if you can find the clip, them talking about how much it  costs to keep that White House running.  Because now, I mean, $12 million and a billion, obviously, that's ridiculous.  I see what they're saying here.  They're saying that, according to the government's official documents, the White House spent $12.8  million to operate.  But what constitutes operation of the White House?  So they get into it, and there's all these other things that kind of roundaboutly get 
[00:30:30]  to...  You know, it's because of the White House, but not directly.  Right.  So at the end of all that stuff, that's when you get that number that Ope's talking about.  There you go.  Total cost of all White House elements for fiscal 08 was $1.5 billion.  $1.5 billion.  There you fucking go.  And Danny, hold on.  Hold on.  Because total...  Go to that list.  Because that's...  Yeah, to the top of that.  What does it say?  Total cost of the White House for...  Okay.  Read some of these things and how much they cost.  Compensation of president, including an expense allowance of $50,000. 
[00:31:00]  $450,000 is what he makes.  All right.  So that's his salary, whatever.  Executive rent, resident operating, is that $12,814.  $12 million.  $12 million.  Sorry.  $12,814.  Wait, find some of the good ones, Danny.  That's the original one.  Okay.  U.S. Postal Service, White House branch.  Wait, you missed the vice president's downtown office, man.  All right.  Yeah, keep going then.  $15 million.  And what is that?  Downtown office.  Why would it cost $15.5 million to run that in one year? 
[00:31:30]  The White House office is $53 million.  See, we have money.  The president's unanticipated needs $1 million.  That's his unanticipated...  We didn't anticipate that.  Wait.  And know what that means?  Because I was watching the show, like, all of a sudden, Obama wants burgers.  Right.  So they try to make it look like one day Obama...  I guess he did this.  They showed it on the show last night.  That one day he goes, I'm getting burgers.  And they show him in the White House, hey, who wants burgers? 
[00:32:00]  I'm going for burgers.  I'm going for burgers.  And they got an insider that doesn't work for anybody anymore.  He's like, look, you know, they like to think that all of a sudden Obama just wanted burgers.  But all this shit is planned out way ahead of time.  Of course.  He's just not allowed to one day go, I want burgers.  Yeah.  And then they have to deal with the security and all that just so he can go down to the local burger joint  and get some burgers for the White House for that photo op.  You're not even getting down to the $200 million shit.  Holy shit.  Air Force One.  Air Force One costs $200 million. 
[00:32:30]  Why?  They're estimating.  To park it?  A year.  Yeah.  To fly it.  Until they fly it?  To shine it up real nice.  Did you ever see that plane dirty?  Never.  That helicopter has to be maintained pretty much daily after every flight.  Oh, the helicopter.  Yeah.  The helicopter squadron.  Did you hear about...  You don't want the president going down on Air Force One.  Did you hear about...  Why is that $271 fucking million?  I watched.  I'll tell you.  Air Force One and the helicopters and all that, they regularly tear them apart and put  them back together to make sure that there's no funny business going on. 
[00:33:00]  You could get six Puerto Ricans to do that shit.  Right.  And pay them not even...  They regularly take the whole fucking plane apart to make sure there's no bombs or whatever.  Fair enough.  A bad fucking part that someone said, well, if I put this bad part in, this thing's going  to fall out of the fucking sky.  This is radio, but I have to explain that you have agree with that price face.  No, I don't agree whatsoever.  Like, you're like...  No, my point on this whole thing is...  It's too much money.  I watched this show last night.  I'm like, you realize this country has money to fucking burn, but they continue to take 
[00:33:30]  money from the individual.  That's what I'm saying.  Why wouldn't the president go, you know what?  It's just...  See that and go, I'm going to stay in Chicago.  Right.  I got a nice house.  Just send me a really great fucking security squad.  Just get me on Skype.  I'll do my shit on Skype.  Yes.  Skype.  Why?  This is what I'm saying.  This is just traditional nonsense.  It's nonsense.  Yeah.  It's expected to be in there.  It's the same cost as Thanksgiving.  Right.  Turkey, fucking pans, and...  And when they start talking about how we all have to make sacrifices, they ain't knocking 
[00:34:00]  that $1.5 billion down.  Nope.  That's staying at $1.5 billion a year.  What else was on that list, Danny?  I saw the post office.  Yeah, how about knocking that down?  The White House has its own post office, and that's $700 and something thousand a year  to maintain.  Improvements at the James J. Rowley Training Center, $3.7 million.  Well, that was a one-time pay, I guess.  Here's what you...  Give me the regular stuff that is year to year. 
[00:34:30]  Here's the problem we have here.  Protection of persons and facilities, $689 million.  I thought you were going to go $1,000.  What?  That's it right there.  Protection of persons and...  Wow.  Okay.  So that's the, like, Secret Service and all their little weapons and training or whatever  the fuck.  That...  Camp David costs almost $8 million a year, and most presidents go there, what, maybe four 
[00:35:00]  times a year, tops?  Yeah, yeah.  And that thing's just sitting there.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, man.  This country has money to burn, and they're just taking money from our fucking pockets.  You don't honestly think they could cut that fucking budget in half?  It doesn't matter.  It's fake money any fucking way.  It's like...  Yeah, good point.  You know, who's getting charged a bill?  When they take our taxes, that's not fake money.  Yeah, but that's a reason that we're going to pay it anyway.  They take your taxes.  Taxes ain't something that we're given for a reason. 
[00:35:30]  They just take it.  They take it.  Oh, money.  Yeah.  Like, people don't...  This is why...  The lack of fury in this country is what makes me tired.  It's because this money is...  It's just...  Yeah, I...  It's just nothing.  But no one's furious that taxes don't really exist like that.  It's just that they're paying back somebody that prints money.  Wow.  So this money's fake.  Dude, four...  Yeah.  It's fake money, man.  Yeah, he did the math.  Over $4 million a day, $4.3 million a day to run the White House, and everything kind 
[00:36:00]  of associated with that.  And it doesn't.  It doesn't.  This show is really...  It's a great show on Anthony's channel there, the History Channel.  I just happened to watch this last night.  And I'm sitting there like, you've got to be kidding me.  They can't knock some of this shit down?  Especially if we're in hard times, supposedly?  Yeah.  Especially if the boss is getting $450,000 a year.  It's the trickle-down theory.  Yeah.  The chef is only getting $90,000.  You know when they have functions and stuff?  I learned last night that in the old days, like, presidents left the White House owing money. 
[00:36:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And they changed that, obviously.  I don't have the figures in front of me, but I think Thomas Jefferson owed, like, $30,000  after he was done.  What Jefferson was saying was...  And $30,000 back then, that's got to be something.  $30,000 and fucking, like, oldie time money.  They had to pay for some of their own shit if they wanted to have a party.  Yeah, but that was back when they were trying to actually make the country this really wonderful  fucking idea.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  They weren't in there going like, by the way, all you people that I'm the president of, 
[00:37:00]  you've got to pay for all my shit.  Right.  Because back then, people would be like, all right, revolt, we're just going to storm  this place.  They were trying to be as different from the queen and king as possible.  And it's turned into worse than what they left.  That's why they've got to keep Super Bowls on, because motherfuckers around, they'll start  to be like Egypt.  Egypt or fucking Libya.  Libya.  It's going to look like Libya.  This world's on an uprise.  And Bob Rain.  I'm not fucking jerking off to this, because you know what?  In all of these people, these revolting revolutionary people, there's a douchebag who's going to 
[00:37:30]  fucking just put his foot on a people's neck, too.  Of course.  You think it's going to be a wonderful place?  Yeah.  Me and I were talking last night on the phone, and yeah, we were saying, like, I feel sorry  for the rest of the country's, you know, following in Egypt's footsteps.  They think it's going to be this great thing.  They think it's going to be a cakewalk.  Did you see the video that went around over the weekend with the fucking people marching toward  the military?  Did you see the video?  Libya?  I think it was Bahrain.  Bahrain. 
[00:38:00]  They thought it was going to be this.  Oh, it's the mother of Bahrain?  Yeah, Bahrain's like freaking out.  Where is Bahrain?  I don't even know.  I'm not even going to make believe I know.  It's there.  It's there.  Between Egypt and fucking Libya.  Where is it, though?  Where is that map?  It's close.  But dude, they're marching toward the military, and it's like, all right, we've got an Egypt  situation.  This is cool.  I'm going to check this out.  And they think it's going to be like, yeah, let's go to the town square here, and we'll build  toilets, and we'll get people with flags.  They were like, uh-uh.  All of a sudden, it's like a fire video.  Was that who they killed?  That was the Bahrain people?  Yeah.  Oh, so you saw the video. 
[00:38:30]  And all of a sudden, you heard the gunfire.  The cameraman says, fuck this.  And when he gets his composure back and turns it toward the people, you see fucking dead  people on the road.  And one guy with dress pants and fucking, and he's just doing the, turning in circles.  You're walking towards the fucking dictator's army.  What the fuck do you think is going to happen?  Well, because everyone saw the Egypt thing.  Yeah, they saw the Egypt thing.  They thought, look, this is kind of easy. 
[00:39:00]  We can do this.  It's like, yeah, that's easy.  And then you got the people showing their bloody hands.  I got blood on my hands.  You see the Egypt thing, and it's like, oh, this is great.  You get out there.  You don't leave.  And then the leader goes, okay, I'm leaving.  And you get somebody like Gaddafi.  He's like, you know what?  No.  Get the Air Force.  I want fighter planes to bomb the protesters.  And do you understand, people don't get this about America.  And look at, this is the thing. 
[00:39:30]  You travel.  I love this country.  In terms of living your life and just away from everything else and have equality, it's  the best place you can be.  But it does some really fucking horrible shit.  And when you got guys like these dictators who will kill their people, those are the  people we work with.  We love a dictator who puts his foot on the people's neck, and they pay him off.  We haven't heard from Gaddafi in years.  He was around when Reagan was around.  In years we haven't heard. 
[00:40:00]  But we always hear about Armadillo Gilead.  And we always hear about the guy from, not Colombia.  From North Korea?  No, North Korea.  But he's a motherfucker.  But the guy, it's not Argentina.  It's the...  Oh, Venezuela.  Venezuela?  Venezuela.  Yeah, yeah, that motherfucker.  What's his name?  Lou...  That's not Lou.  Yeah, I know.  Anyway, that fucker loves his people.  He's trying to keep all the resources for himself, all the oil, all the fucking Chavez. 
[00:40:30]  So all this shit, they hate motherfuckers like that who love...  They don't like dictators who love their people.  No.  But here's the fucked up shit.  With all these uprisings, America's going to be in deep shit because all this paperwork  is going to come out.  This WikiLeaks shit.  And they're in cahoots with these countries, man.  And that's why they keep them quiet.  Like, oh, we fucked up.  Yeah.  Because you can't account for the people rising up.  Basically, yeah.  A lot more people in the Middle East are going to not like America.  Not that we're...  Once they find out how much shit... 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, they're going to hate us even more is what I should say because I don't think  they're rah-rah about America in general.  But hopefully they hear this somewhere in Bahrain.  Listen, we ain't got nothing to do with it.  The citizens don't know.  No.  America don't know this shit.  Oh, we don't know the back...  We don't know what the fuck's going on.  Oh, why that leader was in there.  What he's been fucking keeping his people down for.  So...  Yeah.  And what are they looking for?  What are like all these protesters?  What do they want?  They want the Obama thing, which isn't happening. 
[00:41:30]  A sandwich?  No.  No.  They want...  I told Ann last night, they want the Obama thing.  That's not happening in this country.  So many people thought their lives were going to drastically change when Obama went in office.  And they're, at this point, realizing that's not an easy thing ever.  He was here.  He was perfect at the time because it wasn't a good white guy around.  Yeah.  It was a perfect time because the country was feeling...  I think they were feeling revolutionary because of George W.  It was getting...  People were getting mad at that motherfucker.  And they put Obama into just... 
[00:42:00]  Right.  Everybody went, my God.  Yeah, but the point...  This is some Jesus-y shit that just happened.  But the point...  Yeah, Jesus-y.  People really, really believe their lives were going to get...  Yeah.  Not a little better, drastically better.  And that's what's happening in Egypt and all these other places.  They're convinced now in Egypt that their lives are going to be drastically different.  It's not...  Well, they've got to put a leader in.  Yeah.  They've got to have a leader.  Their lives will get better.  And then you fast forward maybe 20 years, maybe it gets significantly better.  But in general, their lives aren't going to drastically change.  But it's not.  Leaders are... 
[00:42:30]  This is tradition.  Mm-hmm.  It's like...  It's like people go, oh, is he a nice guy?  On Fallon, I go...  But they cut all that out.  I go...  I go, it's a shame he has to be the president because he seems like a nice guy.  Yeah.  But it's just like being a car salesman.  You could go, he's a nice guy, but what he does...  He's a car salesman, right?  No, man.  Like, his job is to do...  Obama knows all the shit that we do, and he doesn't quit.  So anybody that knows what we do to the world and has an idea and goes, I'm going to still 
[00:43:00]  do this job knowing what the fuck we are and how we do, knowing that it costs a billion  dollars to live in this fucking house...  I bet there's no out, though.  You ever think there's been a president that got elected, found out what's going on, and  goes, I can't in good conscience do this?  I can't.  Yeah, he quit.  And then it's like, yeah, I quit.  Really?  All right.  Why don't you just do that one last motorcade down there in Dallas, and you quit after  that.  And his brother was going to tell everybody why he quit. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  So his brother had to be let go.  He had to go.  We have to let you go.  Lincoln quit.  Certainly suspicious, that's for sure.  You know, I'm going to go to this play, and then I'm just going to announce that I'm  done with the presidency of the United States.  And you know what?  I might blurt out some of this shit that went on during the Civil War.  Because some of the stuff, I'm not feeling too good about it.  All right, Mr. President.  Here, we got your presidential box up here at Ford's Theater.  It's a great, funny play.  You sit and enjoy.  Oh, really?  He put his resignation papers in. 
[00:44:00]  They were wrapped up into a small bullet.  It's in his head.  Read this.  I'm going to shoot you between the eyes.  Read this shit.  And JFK made a big speech.  People forget that speech he made about secret societies.  The huge speech in front of people about, we don't operate in secrecy.  This is not what we do.  And he just was, JFK, but anybody who galvanizes people in a positive direction gets smoked, man.  It just is because this country cannot afford for people to have the veil uncovered because 
[00:44:30]  you can't afford to have 350 million people running around trying to take over the country  and revolt.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't afford it.  What do you think would happen to this country if we all rose up?  I don't know.  There's shit going on in Wisconsin right now.  You think it would be a Libyan situation where they just start firing us?  They would have to.  They would have to, right?  They would have to.  We think we're more civilized than that, but I think it would be ugly in this country.  Yeah, they would call it something else. 
[00:45:00]  If it was a bunch of blacks, Puerto Ricans, Chinese, right?  Oh, no.  Marching towards this room because they didn't like you motherfuckers.  Yeah.  After they got through Kenny, maybe Keith.  Yeah.  Then it's you and you have your pistol.  People are dropping.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  People are dropping.  I mean, the White House is right there.  If 50 million people decided, I'm going to Washington and just bum-rush the White House.  What did they want to do?  They probably got some shit, man. 
[00:45:30]  What?  A giant pepper spray thing that comes out the top of the...  I'm thinking giant trap doors.  The whole street just goes.  With James Bond villain shit.  Why else $1.5 billion a year?  They got some shit.  The secret shit that never popped out during 9-11.  You're right, dude.  It was like $685 billion.  What?  Well, that was to hollow out the street below so we could just take it out. 
[00:46:00]  It'll fly just like a spaceship flies away.  All of a sudden, the White House just becomes its own island.  Spaceship.  Right.  Right.  It takes off.  It just launches.  With that dirt and roots.  Yeah, everything around it just fucking...  Fucking the Washington Monument is a missile.  It's a giant buff.  I don't even want to know.  That Lincoln statue is a transformer.  He gets up and starts killing people.  It's fucking...  The Lincoln Memorial gets up and just starts racking heads. 
[00:46:30]  Are you fucking serious, man?  The eternal flame turns into a flamethrower.  Look like Jason and the Argonauts.  Everything with system.  Animatria.  Like claymation.  How great would this movie be?  In DynaVision.  I would see this movie.  It's...  I don't know why they call people...  Look, again, I just believe in everything.  Yeah, yeah.  But I still, just as a quality country, this is a great pretend country. 
[00:47:00]  The other countries, it's just reality.  All day long reality of, I have a guy in office that's stealing my money, but he's my leader.  How did this happen?  And we are kept so busy and so distracted...  Distracted.  ...that we don't look at it and join together to go like, wow, you know, something really has to be changed.  And I don't mean by an election and shit like that.  Like revolution.  And you see it in these countries.  You feel it.  Like revolution.  But as Americans, we would never even dream of that because, my God, Lindsay Lohan is in court in a little slinky dress. 
[00:47:30]  And by the way, that dress, we're going to tell you what it's selling for if you stick around till 11.  And you love it.  That's why you do comedy.  You just go...  You know, I'm angry enough to like go on a show and like be comfortable enough to just fuck with the audience.  It's like, where it's like, I fuck with the audience.  So it's like, but you go on and you really, you understand how awful it is. 
[00:48:00]  It's just drones sitting there that don't care.  That I still, to this day, I don't know why no one cares about birds falling out of the sky.  Like you look around and go, you just, you just look around and you go, I just care.  Can somebody help me?  Can someone care?  I think we all care deep down.  We know some shit's going on.  We just don't want to deal with it.  But like...  Deal with it.  Because we got the latest video game coming out.  Fucking the Knicks got...  That's right.  The Knicks got Carmelo...  Distractions.  The Knicks just got Carmelo Anthony. 
[00:48:30]  Come on.  I could care less about birds falling out of the sky now.  Do you think these countries in the Middle East have the amount and depth of distractions that we have?  Absolutely not.  Well, that's why Gaddafi needs...  Gaddafi needs like an Entertainment Tonight to be on that TV immediately.  He needs an E.T. on public, on his government-run television.  He needs like Entertainment Tonight.  He needs like that fucking, that other gossip show.  He needs all that shit.  He needs video games.  He should get Joan Rivers over there pronto.  Yeah, reality shows. 
[00:49:00]  Something.  Some distractions.  They need distractions.  Because he's going down.  I think Gaddafi's going to lose.  I do too.  I really, yeah.  And you were saying before the show, his son is an evil mother.  His son, when you start...  When you start yelling, there will be blood in the streets, those leaders that are into  that blood running through the streets thing, ah, it's going to be dangerous.  Yeah, you can't get them out.  But here's another issue that America, I think, has that maybe, you know, Egypt didn't have 
[00:49:30]  is that it was a confusion between the cops and the military.  Some of the military and the police were like, how can I shoot my people?  Yeah.  We, you know, it's an us and them thing in this country.  Everybody, everything is an us and them.  Racial fucking power.  It's like, you know, they sell at Brookstone now and it's easy to get.  The camera is no bigger than the top of this.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The top, it's, it's a pen. 
[00:50:00]  It's a pen and it's another one that's just...  Yeah, but it's a pen.  And they're spies.  To have you spy on your, on your neighbor.  To have you...  Yeah.  They, they separate us so well.  And it's like, look at, you know, you're the head.  We're going to give you, okay?  You got to pay, you know, we talk about the fees, the condo fees.  It's like, help, you know, we're going to let you off.  You don't have to pay condo fees if you keep your foot on your neighbor's neck.  If you will get in there and get that money, you get in there and then now, you're Gaddafi's son. 
[00:50:30]  It's just...  I'll fucking take that deal.  It's just so, it's so much stuff to keep us from being dedicated to each other.  That is no, but that's, that's, that's what makes you tired is that you just don't see any, any anger.  And they, and they're good at keeping it down.  It's just, I don't know how we move on to the next thing.  Yeah.  Like, there's one, like, like, is there a thing, okay.  We just don't.  Is there a thing in your life that you go, that bothers you so much in terms of what's going on in the world?  And you go, let's not move on from that until I'm, I'm completely quenched of this. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, but it, it goes away.  It moves on.  You forget about these things.  And, and, and the distractions that are thrown at us keep us from uniting.  They keep us from having a dialogue with each other that doesn't involve Lindsay Lohan or the golden throat fucking homeless guy.  Or the fucking, that was, that was a debacle of, of taking our, like, taking away our fucking concentration.  Cause that fucker, he went right back into being his mother. 
[00:51:30]  We saw that coming a mile away.  We said it the first day.  If you pull tape of us on day one when that story broke, we said, this motherfucker, they're making it sound like this poor homeless guy got an opportunity.  When meanwhile, homeless guys are crazy.  Like, there are some homeless people that are like homeless and like, oh, I don't know what happened.  I had a job at the office.  I was laid off.  I couldn't find any money.  Now, me and my family are out on the street. 
[00:52:00]  That's like one, that's point.  Who was that guy doing?  That's like, bro, out on the street.  I don't know how that happened.  Me, my wife, my child, now I have to live in a shelter.  Just normal homeless guy.  Normal homeless.  Like, they, they, some, something happened.  And he's still trying to get back his house, but he can't.  And then there's the other 99.9% of the homeless that are stark raving fucking lunatics.  They are mentally damaged.  They are, are, are defective mentally. 
[00:52:30]  And that's why they live on the streets.  Either they're alcoholics, drug addicts, or fucking paranoid schizophrenics.  They can't fit into society.  That's where this guy fit in.  But they're painting.  They grabbed him.  They threw a suit on him.  They shaved him.  They, they got him to do Kraft macaroni and cheese commercials.  And, uh, and then he just went right back to doing what he was doing.  And they all knew.  And everyone knew.  Matt Lauer and the rest of them, they all knew.  It was just, let's do a show. 
[00:53:00]  They used him for their own ratings.  It didn't take any time.  Oh, that was the fastest rise and fall.  The fastest rise and fall.  And you, and you know, you knew.  But now he's kind of back again.  From his mother, from his mother's reaction.  Which, don't, she just hated him.  She said, this is horse shit.  She knew.  She knew.  He's like, oh mommy, oh mommy, oh mommy.  And she's like, don't, she was cold as fuck, wasn't she?  Don't disappoint me again.  That's what she said.  Don't disappoint me again.  She had it, man. 
[00:53:30]  She'd been disappointed by this motherfucker so many times.  Stealing this shit.  Of course.  Stealing her, her fucking brooch that her great, great grandmother.  Sold it for.  You know that shit.  What's going on?  Sold it for a fucking sandwich.  And I hit a fucking bottle of muscatel.  She sold it.  She had a picture with her and Harriet Tubman.  And he fucking sold it.  Hi mommy.  Hi mommy.  Hi mommy.  Hi mommy.  I love you mommy.  I love you too, son. 
[00:54:00]  I love you.  Please don't disappoint me.  I'm not mom, I'm not.  It's I love you too, son.  First thing she goes, I love you too, son.  Second, please don't disappoint me.  Not like, wow, you're doing very well for yourself.  It's good.  He's like, I love you.  Look, I love you too.  She might as well have said, yeah, I love you too.  By the way, public people, he's going to fuck this up so bad in record time.  But did you see the tape of her before the reunion? 
[00:54:30]  Oh no, no.  She was trashing him.  Really?  She just knew.  Did you see that?  Oh yeah.  The pre-reunion where they found her and said, did you see what's going on?  And she just was like, he is a bum, a fucking problem, a piece of shit.  She's 95 years old and she just is like, this guy, I should have killed him.  Like Carrie's mother.  I should have killed you when you came out the womb. 
[00:55:00]  I should have.  Let's go to the closet and pray.  Why did it touch me?  All right, we're just getting started.  Of course, we got Patrice.  I want to talk about the special when we get back.  Yeah, that's funny shit, man.  I'm a little mad because it was on during the fucking slam dunk contest.  I'm going to tell you something.  You didn't miss shit.  That slam dunk contest, that horse manure.  No, but we'll talk about it.  I mean, we'll talk about that and other things after the break.  Stay there.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:55:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  The official radio show of the coming apocalypse.  Ron and Fez, next at 11 a.m. Eastern on the virus.  Uh, it's a poster of a McDonald's breakfast.  Now, don't you feel embarrassed, Fez, that you thought it was going to be bad?  It's a giant egg breakfast to mock me with.  It is bad, Ron.  Listen at your own risk.  I've turned heel on starving orphans today. 
[00:56:00]  Ron and Fez, today at 11 a.m. Eastern.  On the virus.  On the Sirius XM.  Here's what women do and men do.  If this was a company, we start out in the mail room.  You start out as a fucking get the coffee.  We have to start out by what have you accomplished thus far in your fucking life.  So we have to come in and your company as get the coffee, but it has to be as a CEO of what we accomplished.  Pull your pants down. 
[00:56:30]  Then I'll tell you what kind of car I drive.  After you, pull your fucking pants down.  I don't want to fucking dance.  Pull your fucking pants down.  I want to see it.  Pull your fucking pants down.  This is not all I want.  Unless that's all you got.  Pull your fucking pants down.  I don't want to take you out to the Spitzer restaurant.  Pull your fucking pants down.  Prove I can pay for it.  Pull your fucking pants down. 
[00:57:00]  Prove I got a nice car.  Pull your fucking pants down.  Prove I got an education.  Pull your fucking pants down.  To see your cooch.  Hands down.  Pull your fucking pants down.  Don't force me to make you a better person.  Pull your fucking pants down. 
[00:57:30]  Uncross your eyes, you goofy hoe.  Pull your fucking pants down.  I want to see it.  Pull your fucking pants down.  Hands down.  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  And now, the Opie and Anthony show.  On a higher end.  Sirius XM.  We're hanging with Big Mama Prods today. 
[00:58:00]  Patrice O'Neal had his Comedy Central special over the weekend.  And I'll tell you from my Twitter, people were really, really digging it.  Really digging it.  Bam, bam.  Does that make you happy?  Yeah.  I mean, I was happy out here.  But fame hasn't called yet.  We were talking about that last week.  You're just hoping that fame calls now.  Yeah.  But see, in a lot of people's minds, that's fame.  That you have a Comedy Central special.  Yeah.  But there's levels of that.  Yeah.  Not to...  You're hoping for fame to call. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Were you just looking at your phone all weekend?  I, uh...  But yesterday was President's Day.  A lot of people took Monday off.  So today's the day that fame should call.  You probably wouldn't know fame called until probably a year from now, two years.  You know?  If, uh...  If the people get it in their hands, that's all I...  That's what I...  Well, the DVD comes out today, is it?  Or tomorrow?  Tuesday.  What's today's date?  Oh, today is Tuesday, right?  The DVD's out today.  Then today's the day.  Oh, that is it.  45 minutes of extra shit. 
[00:59:00]  That's great.  Some, you know...  Talking about, what, an elephant in the room?  Yeah.  What's the name of it, right?  Elephant in the room.  Elephant in the room.  Did you see the way it was on the fucking channel guide?  It just said Patrice O'Neill elephant.  Didn't fit.  Are you serious?  Yeah, it just said Patrice O'Neill elephant.  I didn't mind, though.  Oh, Patrice.  It just, you know, you just...  Because that's why I really named it elephant in the room, not to...  Not for what it means.  I really named it because I'm overweight.  You didn't mean like...  No, but I did mean it because it's a double meaning. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  But I did it because it's just like I'm the elephant in the room twice.  There it is.  Patrice O'Neill elephant.  Which, let me tell you something.  That's horrible.  Can I tell you?  This is why I didn't name it.  I wanted to name it 800-pound gorilla, right?  For real.  It would have been the Patrice O'Neill gorilla.  Elephant.  Yeah.  That would have just been fucking worse.  It would have been unfair to white folks to have the maturity to pass that over. 
[01:00:00]  But elephant in the room, they could get with...  But elephant, dude, that's what Shaka Zulu called himself.  That's like king of the beast.  Yeah.  For real.  So Patrice O'Neill elephant is great, but people can't...  Because I'm overweight.  So I give them something to fucking think about.  It's just something to think about here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm fat.  Call me elephant.  But for real, elephant is some arrogant shit.  It's an arrogant title.  It tests him.  It's just arrogant.  It tests the viewer's maturity.  It does.  Are they going to just call you fat, or are they going to understand what elephant really means? 
[01:00:30]  Patrice O'Neill fat fuck in the room.  Right.  Which is for the haters, you know what I'm saying?  Enjoy.  You made it easy for the haters.  Yeah.  They should be thanking you today.  Yeah.  I think about everybody.  Haters, you're welcome.  Patrice made it easy for you.  I think about everybody, man.  I've seen it like a million times before it was on TV, but I was watching at the same time  as where I thought everybody else was watching.  It's just to see, like...  We hope fame calls today.  Yeah, yeah.  We really do hope fame calls.  Fame also.  Fame will give a ring.  Hey, NBA All-Star game was up against the special. 
[01:01:00]  That pissed me off.  Because people do tune into that stupid slam dunk contest.  Comedy Central will run it, hopefully.  A million times.  Because they paid for it.  Yeah, so they're going to want that.  It's not a do-it-yourselfer.  Right.  I didn't go into cahoots with a management company to try to sell it on the road.  I DVR'd the slam dunk contest, and I went there afterwards, and douche chills, man.  Me and Patrice were talking a little bit during the break.  Douche fucking douche chills.  Because you explained it. 
[01:01:30]  Every dunk has been done by the guys.  Yeah, there's no more...  There's no more...  There's not much else you can do.  Centrifugal energy for the nigga to turn in the air anymore.  Like, how many more times can you turn?  It broke out two hoops.  Yeah, the guy dunked two balls.  He did three.  Who cares?  He did three.  And nobody cares.  He dunked three balls.  It wasn't that.  On two hoops.  His name...  Wow.  Exactly.  I swear to God, I have no fucking idea.  His name is fucking Jim. 
[01:02:00]  Jim, the giant nigga who can fucking dunk three balls.  No one cares.  The top player...  Here's the difference.  Here's the difference between the dunk contest then and now.  Ready?  I'll give you the first name.  Name the last name of the guy.  One of the guys.  Surge.  Exactly.  Surge.  Ibaka.  And what did he do?  Yeah, what did he do?  He's the fourth best player on his team.  Fourth best.  DeMar DeRozan.  Big drop off.  He might be the first now, but he was the third because everybody left. 
[01:02:30]  But I don't...  I'm not a huge NBA fan these days, so I'm not a good...  Look at this shit.  He missed that...  See that dunk he just made?  Yeah.  He missed that seven times.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I hate.  They have two minutes to complete the dunk.  This dunk right here?  It would have been nice if he made it the first time, but he's still standing there like...  Why do they allow these guys...  I guess because they want them to do really difficult dunks.  Because they need highlights.  Right.  They need...  You know, here's him missing.  But we talked about this...  I hate to use the term Jump the Shark because it's overused, but I think the Slam Dunk Contest 
[01:03:00]  really jumped the shark this year because they brought out that little kid.  The little kid from America's Got Talent, if you remember.  All of a sudden, they're just kind of hanging out all of a sudden like,  Mr.  Mr.  Oh, no.  I can't find my toy.  Can you get...  Oh, there it is.  Can you get it for me?  There must have been a creative meeting.  How the fuck did that shit get up there?  Danny, if you can find it.  Because it is so uncomfortable.  So the thing is, the little kid comes out, he loses his toy, and oh, wow, the toy's on the rim. 
[01:03:30]  So then the fucking guy, another guy, I don't know his name, the dunk is going to be...  He's going to dunk the ball, and then he's also going to grab the toy with his teeth.  Wow, that's crazy.  The problem is, he didn't do it correctly the first time, and the toy falls to the ground  because he missed the dunk, I think.  Yeah.  So now they had to awkwardly put...  They awkwardly had to put...  Oh, short, short, where are you going?  You lost?  Here.  It's a little Asian kid with a mohawk.  What's wrong? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, no.  My toy's stuck in the loop.  What did you do?  I don't know.  All right, let's ask the man to possibly do something.  Oh, no.  He just happens to be sitting there.  Can we see if you don't get it?  Oh, Roger?  I'm doing anything for your Asian ass.  Give me...  Why don't you get your mama-san to get your toy, bitch?  Five seconds.  Stand over here, little man.  I wonder where your parents are.  I turned from this.  It got me so disgusted in my stomach.  This is so bad. 
[01:04:30]  It's uncomfortable.  You are...  You are...  Oh, it caught it!  They edited it!  Yeah, of course.  Motherfuckers.  I'm going to take this.  It's been in my mouth.  No, the point is, he didn't complete the dunk, so then they had to awkwardly put the toy back  on the rim.  Oh.  Which then the whole fucking bit doesn't make sense, obviously.  And there is a little, like, thing sticking off the rim.  Right.  Holding his little toy thing there.  And then we had a guy jump over a car. 
[01:05:00]  The guy, because I don't remember his name.  Blake Griffin.  Blake Griffin.  Do you understand why the dunk...  Can I tell you why the dunk contest sucks now?  The great dunk contest was Jordan, Dominique, Larry Nance, fucking Terrence Stansberg.  All the great dunkers were in the fucking dunk.  Spud Webb.  Now, it's the third guy, because LeBron don't want to be in it.  Right.  Kobe's not in it.  Yeah, the main guys don't want to be in it.  And if they were in it, they would be trying to beat each other.  Right.  And that's why it would be great for us.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:30]  That is one of the sickest things I've ever seen, is how far Jordan jumped.  We had a guy...  Don't fucking do that.  We had a seven-footer this year.  He actually was behind the line.  Really?  Yeah.  And it was like, whatever.  Like, no one's talking about it.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Exactly.  Remember when Spud Webb won the fucking dunk contest?  He's 5'2", or whatever the fuck.  He's 5'6", or something.  I would have been pissed at one time in my life if my special came.  I would have said to God, you can't never give me a break, right?  You put my special on against it. 
[01:06:00]  But I really was like, I don't give a shit, because the dunk contest stinks.  Yeah.  Did you see the video of Spud Webb?  He's now some kind of assistant, assistant coach, and some who gives a fuck.  Assistant to the assistant manager at the movie theater.  And they were making fun of him.  They had a video rolling.  Like, you won the slam dunk contest.  Now you're an old man.  I guess he's like 45 or something.  Correct.  And he had a suit on.  He said, oh, really?  Because he's 5'6".  And if you could find the clip, he showed these guys.  He's like, really?  Give me the fucking ball.  He could still dunk at 45, at 5'6". 
[01:06:30]  He was a phenom.  That's pretty impressive.  The greatest dunk contest.  Well, no.  Vince Carter.  But then Spud is right after him to me.  Vince Carter was devastating.  Yeah, but Spud Webb is such...  I know.  He has no height.  And it wasn't that he just...  Here it is.  Yeah.  That's your assist.  That's your assist.  Good shot.  I'm going to pop with the jab step.  Let me see the jab.  Oh!  Yeah, they're just fucking doing warm-ups.  And you got Spud Webb on the sideline with the real coach. 
[01:07:00]  Oh!  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah, you saw that, Spud.  You like that?  What you got, 360?  Come on.  Oh, what you got, 360?  Look at that short little motherfucker.  And he got a gut now, too.  He's got a gut in the suit.  And the guy dunked, and he went to Spud Webb.  He's trash-talking him.  No, don't do that.  Don't do that.  Obviously, they set up this video a little bit.  Yeah, but the acting is funny.  Yeah, the acting is funny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really bad.  Oh, don't do that.  No, he's going to sign it for me.  I appreciate that.  But he's an old guy, like Patrice said, with a little fucking belly now. 
[01:07:30]  It was impressive when he was in shape that he could dunk.  Oh!  Jesus.  He's five, six.  No, no, no.  You think that was in an edit?  No.  Wait, stop.  He was on a trampoline or something.  Oh, shit.  No.  Look.  No.  The floor.  Look at the floor.  All right, hold on.  I said this video a million times.  I know.  I just fucking fire it on me.  No.  Are you serious?  Dude, watch this.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:08:00]  I'm embarrassed.  Because I'm like, how the fuck is he still dunking at this age?  Watch how slow and fat he's moving and how he goes in the air.  Watch.  I'm embarrassed.  Watch.  Please be no trampoline.  Watch.  I will not live this one down.  They're not going to show.  What dunk have you seen?  No feet.  Please.  Something else.  Oh, dude.  He totally stepped.  It's either a trampoline or there's a step there.  There's something that he steps onto.  You see him stop. 
[01:08:30]  Danny, help me out.  Look, watch.  Help me out, Danny.  Right there.  He's up.  He's up on something.  It does look like he eyeballs something real quick.  And you could see him stepping up on something.  Yeah, he stepped up.  He didn't just.  Like, it's not a fluid.  It's not a fluid motion from the ground.  You can't step on air.  I think I'm not well.  Watch this little short shot, man.  He's not well.  Dude, I'm.  Look.  Okay, okay.  I'm off of you and leave me like stuff.  He was going up before he went up.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:09:00]  He walked up some stairs.  I am so fucking embarrassed.  He walked up stairs.  Honestly, now that you pointed out, it's very obvious.  I was like, why isn't this video everywhere?  That there's fucking 45-year-old man with a little belly in the shoe.  Are they saying that it's fake?  Clearly fake.  Oh, my God.  I didn't read the comments.  It's a fake.  I don't read comments on videos.  Absolutely.  Let's see.  He obviously stepped up on something.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, man.  You hear me, too? 
[01:09:30]  You got to check this video.  Nope.  I'm calling bullshit.  Oh, man.  This is clearly fake.  That's so uncomfortable.  Did you see how not jumping he did?  I'm so uncomfortable.  He almost broke in half moving.  The only thing I was...  The acting was so bad, I'm like, okay, obviously they set this up, but I...  Oh, boy.  The actual dunk is so good.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Ha, ha, shit.  Five-seven. 
[01:10:00]  Wow.  And that's him really fucking doing it.  How does he get so high in the air?  He had the best dunks that year.  You know, it's one thing that he's five-seven dunking like that, but then he also had the best dunks.  Does he get stairs?  And Nate gives no credit either, because Nate's five fucking eight.  Who?  Nate Robinson.  He's five-eight.  Five-eight.  Something like that.  He's just as short as spud.  I knew he was under six, but five-eight.  Yeah, he's a music.  He's one of the movies.  That's fucking hysterical.  I'm so embarrassed.  They gave him a little step. 
[01:10:30]  As soon as Patrice said it, it's so obvious.  I don't know why I didn't pick up on that the first time.  You just wanted to be so...  I wanted to believe.  Yeah, you just wanted to believe.  You wanted to believe.  You wanted to believe.  I want to believe in fairy tales.  You've never seen a dunk, right?  You've never seen a dunk where you didn't see the feet.  Yes.  Yes, that's the whole part of the dunk.  Show any of these dunks and you don't...  I figure it was the dumb camera guy.  Didn't have the shots set up.  Yeah.  They had all the time to...  Oh, there's the feet.  There's the feet. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, look there.  Even Jordan.  The famous shot of Jordan losing his mind.  And Jordan wasn't in the dunk contest that year.  He was hurt that year.  That was the only reason?  That's when he fucked his foot.  Very hurt.  My feelings.  Yeah, but if you don't got the main fucking stars of the league in the dunk contest...  It's no good.  It's no good, right?  Holy shit.  Who started that shit where, like, look, I'm too good to be in the dunk contest?  Nobody.  It was Dr. J versus David Thompson, which was the biggie.  Artist Gilmore was in it, I think.  But the biggie was Dr. J versus David Thompson. 
[01:11:30]  Then they just stopped it.  They stopped the dunk contest, and they brought it back in 84, I think, with Larry Nance, Dr. J.  I don't think Jordan was in it.  He might have been in it, but...  I think Jordan did it in the beginning.  Dominique.  That's when they brought it back.  And they should just take a break now.  Because right now, the three-point contest is more...  People like it more because it's just a skill you can't fake.  Right.  It's simplicity.  Right, right, right.  Because this other thing they're doing, they're just trying too hard, it's the guard skill 
[01:12:00]  challenge, which bores you to tears.  Of course.  It's like an obstacle course, Anne.  It's the fucking...  Really?  It's the Chicago...  Throw the ball through this hole, take a jump shot here, then zig and zag, dribbling.  What is that about, Sam?  No cares.  It was so dumb to watch.  Nobody gives a shit.  Right.  And then it's the other thing where they got the girl...  I didn't get that.  The old guy and the present guy of a town.  So Chicago would be, you know, the girl that plays for the Chicago girl team. 
[01:12:30]  I love that.  That's how much we care.  The Chicago girl team.  Then it'll be the best Chicago guy that plays now and a Chicago guy that played back in the  day.  And they got to make one from half-court.  And they got to make fucking shots.  It just stinks.  And they should just stop.  But the All-Star game stinks, too, because it's just not...  It's not the pageantry.  No one cares.  It was a hundred...  Yeah, it really is.  No one cares.  It was something like 147, 143 this year.  Yeah, because no one played defense. 
[01:13:00]  No defense.  They just like...  Because you know why?  It's the ethic.  This is why I don't like basketball.  I used to be a basketball fan.  Here's what I would do.  I would follow a guy from high school.  Let's say Kenny Anderson.  Okay, Kenny Anderson was who was probably one of the...  You know, probably in the top 10 all-time high school players in terms of lore.  And what happened is, guys like that, I would follow him through his college career and  then to the pros.  So, seven years into the pros, if he sucked, I would finally go, oh my God, he sucks. 
[01:13:30]  But I would be following him up to that point.  Right.  But here's why basketball is good.  It used to be good.  But when you was a kid and you watched Barkley, Jordan, Dominique, Kevin McHale, Larry Bird,  Magic Johnson, and then Moses Malone, right, play, you wasn't a high school kid and watched  Moses Malone and went, I'm coming out of high school.  I'm going to go down low with Moses Malone.  You were scared to death of Charles Barkley and Moses Malone and Larry Bird. 
[01:14:00]  You said, fuck it, I'm going to school.  And I'm going to stay in fucking school.  You come out after four years of playing, you earn some lore, you earn some pedigree,  and then people go, I want to see how he's going to be in the pro.  But now, the ethic ain't there.  It's like these guys, like, the reason why the LeBron thing bothered everybody that were  old school is because you go, I would have never thought I had to join forces with Magic  to win shit.  I would go down to my dying breath trying to win myself and be the man responsible. 
[01:14:30]  These guys are not the guys that used to play when you were into it.  They just have a different mentality.  They're buddies.  They're smiling.  I remember the first year Jordan was in the All-Star game.  You know that they fucking band together.  They fucking colluded.  Isaiah, Magic, they colluded to make sure Jordan looked like an asshole.  They said, fuck him. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, not anymore, man.  These guys all hang out together.  They're buddies, man.  They're buddies, even though they're on a different team.  Carmelo, Isaiah still hates Carmelo.  Carmelo blasted Isaiah.  He had a, if you look at Isaiah's face, it's a terrible scar over his eye.  Jesus.  Because Carmelo gave him a buck fifty with his fucking elbow, and it's still fucked up.  I think he had to have, like, plastic surgery to get it fixed.  To this day, he doesn't like him.  It was word that Isaiah had put a hit out on Carl Malone. 
[01:15:30]  It was like all kind of that shit.  The Jordan rules, you know, where the Jordan rules were, fuck Jordan up.  If he comes there, they'll punch him in his face.  But she's right.  And now they're all just buddy buddies.  Now they're just palsy-wowsies.  Hey, let's get together and have a great team together.  You want to do that?  Yeah.  And being a sort of, I should say, a sort of Knicks fan, I'm psyched that Carmelo Anthony's  coming here.  But now we're building our super team.  Knicks made out, man.  Yeah.  We're building our super team because, you know, what LeBron started, they started their 
[01:16:00]  super team thing.  So now you're going to have a league that has five or six super teams, and the rest of them  are just going to be, they might as well be the Washington Generals.  But super teams now are only talent.  This is why the Celtics should never be able to beat Miami on a physical level.  They're 35-year-old men.  But they have old school heart.  They play old school.  They got one young monster, which is Rondo, but they play like an old school team. 
[01:16:30]  And Miami doesn't.  Miami plays like a new school team, but they should never lose to the Celtics ever because  they just, LeBron is a monster.  He's just the best player in the league.  He's unstoppable.  But the fucking Knicks, man, they got rid of, I don't, if I was Denver, I'd have made  sure I got their whole team, man, for Carmelo.  Carmelo's a super duper star.  Oh, yeah, he is.  And they gave away, they got, here's the problem, if you're a Knicks fan, I'm a Celtics fan, 
[01:17:00]  but I watch more Knicks because it's here.  Yeah, that's the game that's on.  So I see them all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  If they got rid of Gallinari, who's a big bum, he's a seven-foot jump-shooting bum.  He's not wrong.  Why do you think they got rid of him?  He's not wrong.  And they got rid of Chandler, Wilson Chandler, who's a, he's just a journeyman.  He's a good player, man, but he's going to be a journeyman guy. 
[01:17:30]  He's not, he's not championship quality.  The other guy, Mozgov, is another big Russian mummy.  And they got rid of, who's the other name?  And Felton, who I like a lot, he ain't no championship.  He's just, they're tough guys and they're, they're, they're, they're comparable or competent,  but they, they got to keep Landry Fields.  That's who, that's who Denver should have said, you to throw Landry, because they got to keep Landry Fields. 
[01:18:00]  Who's a fucking second round?  Really, if it wasn't for John Wall and Blake Griffin, Landry Fields would be up for the rookie of the year.  He's a beast.  They got to keep him.  Denver's dumb.  Knicks fans should be, some guy wrote something about, I forgot his name, one of these old guys that said the Knicks didn't do anything.  Phil Mushnick.  Phil Mushnick.  Yeah, some dude.  Phil Mushnick hated this trade. 
[01:18:30]  And I'm going, this fucking trade for the Knicks is tremendous.  It seems like a great one.  They got two superstars.  And how you win a championship.  Yeah, because we got Chauncey too, man.  You got Chauncey.  Chauncey is, Chauncey is a good player.  He's Felton.  He's Felton.  He's Raymond Felton, except for he's older.  He gives you what Raymond Felton gave you.  He's got some years left.  Kind of a chubby dude that just throws it to Amari, yo.  That's chubby.  You have Amari and Carmelo on the same team.  This is big, man. 
[01:19:00]  New York should be.  This is a biggie.  This is big.  They might not win a lot this coming up because they got to figure it all out.  They have two superstars in the top 15.  But now we got a chance in the playoffs.  No, you don't.  I said a chance.  I'm not saying...  Yeah, you got to put it this way.  We'll do all right.  Yeah.  I mean, you got two superstars on the Knicks, man.  We'll do all right.  You haven't had two superstars on the Knicks since they won the championship back in the  day.  I know, but the thing is you need three.  No, you don't.  Well, they say three. 
[01:19:30]  I'll argue with you about that.  Here's what you need.  You need three.  You need two.  You need a shooter.  You need two super duper stars.  And one super?  Here's how you win.  Either you have this.  You have a super universal type of motherfucker.  LeBron.  A cosmic motherfucker like LeBron.  Kobe.  And two all-stars, like normal good guys, and then two competent bums.  You can win a championship. 
[01:20:00]  He doesn't wait with everything.  No, seriously.  Look at the Lakers back in the 80s.  It was Magic super duper.  Kareem super duper.  No.  Who's a competent bum?  You got to put a face to that.  I'll tell you, a competent bum is Kendrick Perkins.  A competent bum is Derek Fisher.  He's a competent bum.  Because you have Kobe, who's a superstar.  Right.  And you have Lamar Odom. 
[01:20:30]  Fisher doesn't get respect because he plays for the Lakers.  And Paul Gasol, who are big time all-stars.  And Fisher just does it day in and day out.  And when the Lakers won with Shaq, it was two superstars.  It was Kobe and Shaq.  And then there was three competent bums.  That's the old school way.  You needed two guys on a team.  You needed three guys.  You needed Larry Bird.  Most people would acknowledge, too, like Jordan had Pippen.  Yeah, but was Pippen the same level as Jordan?  No.  No.  Of course not.  You're proving my theory. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, but he made the all-star game as well.  But he wasn't top echelon guy.  Kobe and Shaq, definitely.  Kobe and Shaq were echelon.  And then you can't name the other three.  Bigger than on that team?  Yeah.  No, he couldn't.  Well, Fisher was on the team.  The Celtics are the 80s.  Bird, super-duper star.  Right.  Parrish and McHale.  Right.  All-stars.  Right.  Normal guys, but good.  Right.  And then other two bums.  Who are the competent bums?  Danny Ainge and Dennis Johnson.  See, Danny Ainge is a competent bums. 
[01:21:30]  You're right.  Competent bums.  He was a bum who was good.  Kind of need a three-point shooter.  Just make this shot.  Yeah, you need someone that just makes that one shot.  You had Steve Kerr on the Bulls.  The Knicks have two superstars right now.  Yeah, we need a third.  You need a third.  And here's the thing.  Just because that's what...  Here's what's great about Carmelo, what's going to happen with him.  Is that he doesn't have to now be the guy to have heart.  He's only really a scorer.  He's a scoring machine.  Amari is a beast. 
[01:22:00]  He's a fucking angry, mean motherfucker who dunks it in your face every chance he gets.  He's the leader.  So, Carmelo could just be what he is.  Kind of drops 30, but it's easy.  He could drop 50 if he had a mean streak.  But he's so talented, he could drop 30.  And his kind of lazy 30 is better than most of these motherfuckers.  Really hard, hard fucking 50.  I mean, the Knicks are good now. 
[01:22:30]  It's a big deal.  I can't wait to watch it tomorrow.  They're going to be there playing tomorrow.  And while we're talking about sports here, Anthony's team's getting a little shit today.  Fucking Hank Steinbrenner.  Yeah, saying that the guy's getting a little fat.  Well, Hank Steinbrenner said that...  He basically said that Derek Jeter was more interested in building his mansion in Tampa than playing ball last year.  They have a problem with Jeter just because the negotiations were so rough.  And Jeter, his mansion's... 
[01:23:00]  They have a fault, by the way.  Jeter's mansion is complete.  It's on the front page of the papers today.  It's their fault.  It's their fault.  First of all, for these scumbags to badmouth Jeter in any way,  the guy's been the fucking heart of the team.  When people go...  He's been pretty free of scandal.  He's been like the face of, hey, look at this.  This is what the Yankees are about.  And then he wants some money. 
[01:23:30]  They lowball him.  He gets in there and goes, no, this is what I want.  And then they shit talk him and stuff.  Fuck that.  I hate the new Steinbrenners.  These fucking Steinbrenner kids.  Yeah, the Qaddafi sons.  Yeah, yeah.  They're like Qaddafi sons.  They're like Uday and fucking...  Saddam Hussein's sons.  They haven't earned their respect yet.  They haven't earned shit.  In the end, George Steinbrenner got a lot of respect from his guys.  George was the fucking...  There was a lot of hate there as well, but he also earned some respect. 
[01:24:00]  George was the fucking guy.  God, you nailed it.  Qaddafi sons are now the fucking Yankees.  Yeah.  Yankee guys.  George was the guy.  He fucking, you know, lost his mind a little bit there, and then he dropped dead.  But to think that just because the son's name's Steinbrenner, that they have that kind of rapport with the team.  I mean, George was a prick to the team a lot of times, a prick to individuals and stuff like that.  But he knew how to, you know, give credit when credit was due and pay players that he knew would be good for the team. 
[01:24:30]  Yankees didn't have to pay Jeter in the end.  They did.  Oh, they did?  Because they knew they had to.  It would have been really bad.  You're not letting Jeter go.  But hold on, hold on.  It would have been really bad.  But the negotiation hurt their souls like they had to come out, like today.  It's on the front page of the paper.  And give a shit like he's too interested.  Shut up.  He was more interested in building his mansion than playing ball last year.  See, that was their way of going, well, fuck you.  But Louis Jeter's done for years for the Yankees. 
[01:25:00]  They should shut the fuck up.  Baseball seems like a sport, though.  You can have distractions and still play.  Yeah, you know, most of the time you're just sitting down.  Like you can take calls from contractors while you're sitting on the bench waiting for your turn at back.  Oh, yeah.  So how much wood do we need?  What do I need?  How's that bathroom coming along today?  Yeah, I'm thinking we need an extra joist on that because I want to go with the vaulted ceiling.  I'll call you next inning.  I've got to get into the batting circle.  Yeah, hold on, hold on.  I'm up.  I'm up.  I'll be right back.  Actually, hold on.  Right.  Hold on.  I'm just going to put the foot.  Talk to Prasada.  I'm going to fucking just, I'll be right back. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, we'll decide the title.  You don't have to be into anything.  No, no, no.  Like if I'm on a bench and they go, hey, O'Neal, we need you to get in there and bunt.  I go, okay, you bunt.  Which side?  Yeah, where do you want me to lay this down?  Third baseline, where am I going?  I don't have to be in the momentum.  No, no.  I can build my house.  You can build your house from the dugout.  That's great.  Here's the question today.  I got one to start it, and it might even be the answer. 
[01:26:00]  Who had the easiest job in baseball history?  Wow.  What do you mean?  And I remember a time, like you say, the guy that maybe his whole job, well, this is what  I mean.  Like, you know, when you get some of these older hitters, all they have to do is they're pinch  hitters.  DH.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, not even DH.  They're literally pinch hitters.  Yeah.  Where they come up every once in a while.  Wait, what's the difference between a DH and a pinch hitter?  Pinch hitter, you know, you could just, you're pinch hitting.  You just take somebody's place. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, take someone's place.  But DH, you hit four times.  DH, you're on the list.  The American League.  But I mean, there's like pinch hitters, like, I guess it's more National League, I guess  is what I'm talking about, where they literally will hire, I think Kurt, Kurt or Kirk, Kirk  Gibson, I think at the end of his career, he was just a pinch hitter.  It's like, yeah, come up here.  And he sat the bench and just every once in a while came in and pinched hit for someone.  That was his job.  He didn't have to play in the field ever.  And he didn't have to play every day either. 
[01:27:00]  He wasn't the DH.  Just sit there on the bench and it's like, hey, we need you.  All these things have happened where we now need you.  That's got to be the easiest job ever.  Yeah.  And baseball just has no...  But there was a...  It's like a Wild West with money.  It just has no...  There's no control over baseball and where the money goes.  There was a guy that played for the A's.  If Danny can find us great or if someone has the name, that'd be awesome too.  His whole job was to pinch run. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's even funnier.  He didn't even know how to play fasty McWiggins.  He just goes in for the slow pitch.  I might be wrong, but I don't think I am on this one.  But I think the A's in the 70s, they actually had a guy.  His whole job was to pinch run.  How much has a pinch run on me?  He didn't even really know how to play baseball.  I don't think he ever hit.  His whole job is to just sit on the bench and wait for that moment where they really  needed a little speed on the bases. 
[01:28:00]  Easiest job ever in baseball right there.  I think baseball is the easiest job in baseball.  Anything.  Any position?  If you're building your house from the dugout, that's great.  I love that.  If you're the third hitter, this is what you do.  Third hitter goes in.  You make a call.  You go, hey, look, I want to talk about these fucking plans for the pool.  There it is.  Herb Washington.  I remember his name.  Herb Washington.  Now, did he ever hit? 
[01:28:30]  Herb Washington.  Had to hit something, right?  No?  Washington became one of the world's most celebrated sprinters as a student athlete at blah,  blah, blah.  The four-time All-American won one and ta-da-da.  What does it say about his baseball career?  That played in 105 major league games without batting, pitching, or fielding.  Wow.  Playing exclusively as a pinch runner.  There you go, Patrice.  His whole job was to pinch run. 
[01:29:00]  Played in 105 games, and that's all he did.  Never took the field and never batted.  I wouldn't have to say paid for that shit.  That's the easiest fucking job in baseball right there.  I believe that's in the 70s, so who knows.  I mean, to run 90 feet.  If you have time to daydream, I don't know if it's a real sport.  Yeah.  Patrice?  If you're in the outfield, just daydreaming.  You can't daydream when you're in an NBA basketball game.  You can't daydream in hockey.  You can't if you're at the end of the bench.  You can.  You can.  I'm talking about...  An actual player. 
[01:29:30]  Okay, fair enough.  You could be in the outfield basically daydreaming.  Daydreaming, yeah.  You could.  Somebody would probably disagree.  I got a couple of really big-time baseball fans.  And they would argue the whole strategy.  And they just hate that I hate baseball.  But that's how you could tell a really good sport is if someone else hates it, you're not really interested.  Like, you don't give a shit.  No one can convince you football sucks.  No.  Like, you go, if you say football sucks, you're dumb.  But fucking baseball, to me, is just shockingly boring. 
[01:30:00]  I can't get into it.  And you got Kevin from Connecticut.  It's kind of brilliant, Kevin.  Opie, the easiest job in baseball was the second-string third baseman for the Orioles between 1982 and 1998.  Oh.  That's a fucking brilliant little instant feedback right there.  Of course, that was Cal Ripken's fucking streak.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  Whatever.  Does this mean anything to anyone?  Who knows?  Yeah, sports.  We did our sports talk.  Well, it's two big stories, though.  Carmelo Anthony coming to the Knicks is huge.  Because we're... 
[01:30:30]  Well, officially, the Knicks are building the second super team in the league.  Yeah.  Officially.  And there'll be another three or four, and then the rest of the league's fucked.  Because they're going to run out of fucking super players.  No, because Oklahoma got super players.  How many...  But how many teams could build a super team?  Well, you just...  You got Miami Heat right now is the only one, technically.  Even though, you know, the Lakers are...  The Lakers are in...  The Lakers are a super team.  And now you got the Knicks starting to build one.  Celtics.  Celtics, you think?  So that's four. 
[01:31:00]  Well, Denver's shitty now.  Cleveland's shitty.  Minnesota has a guy.  Just a guy.  Philadelphia's irrelevant.  Fucking...  That's what I'm saying.  Orlando's a pretty decent team.  Who's going to build a super team in the offseason?  Knicks.  Well, the Knicks, obviously.  They'll find that third.  Knicks are going to be...  And it has to be a bum?  A competent bum?  No, it's going to be...  It might be Dwight Howard at some point.  Really? 
[01:31:30]  He's going to...  Something big's going to happen.  The freak of nature.  Yeah, something big's going to happen.  With those awkward, over-the-top shoulders of his.  They're just palsy-wowsies, though.  It just sucks.  It sucks.  That's a great point today.  It stinks.  Buddy, buddy-wuddies.  And then you got the Derek Jeter mansion was built, so that's another huge story.  Yeah, that's what people are talking about.  That's such bullshit, though.  The guy's done nothing but great things for the Yankees.  But that's why...  How can you get mad, though, when these guys do for themselves? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so you forget that the owners are the worst pieces of shit.  But there's a guy that plays for the Indianapolis Colts, okay?  His name is Bob Sanders.  They let him go, right?  Bob Sanders may be one of the toughest dudes you've ever seen play football.  Just smash it.  You can't score when Bob Sanders is on the field.  He hits you, he smacks you around, he intercepts the ball.  He's devastating.  But he gets hurt.  All the time.  Hurt.  But they just dump him off. 
[01:32:30]  It's like his business, man.  There's no loyalty.  He's like, Bob, you gave your body for us, man.  So anything you do, we're going to pay you for just being out there for a minute.  Yeah.  So they get mad when these fucking guys go do things for themselves.  They say he's prone to injuries.  So they say, we can't deal with this guy.  So I'm going to leave this basketball team because I'm prone to not winning championships.  I'm out of here.  Right.  You know, fuck that.  Fuck it.  You know, I can't get mad.  It is true.  As an owner.  As a fucking owner.  An owner who gets mad at this is basically, it is a slave mentality. 
[01:33:00]  It's like, I own you.  And so when LeBron leaves, he gets so fucking pissed off.  But if LeBron busted his ankle and couldn't play, he'd dump him right off.  Oh, there's the John Travolta without his wig on.  Without the hairpiece.  Oh, look at that face.  He's got worse than Phil Collins.  Even Phil Collins doesn't want.  He's finally saying fuck it, huh?  I guess so.  Did he say fuck it or is he? 
[01:33:30]  And people can't move on with their lives.  They're saying that Ripken played shortstop most of that time there.  Oh, yeah?  So Kevin's line's still brilliant, but Kevin's since third baseman.  But people lose their minds against Ripken played short.  So there you go.  Damn.  Here's your correction.  Why does it say John Travolta is bald, elated?  I'm sure he's elated that these pictures are off on what Tyler Durden did.  Oh, I gotcha.  They were being sarcastic. 
[01:34:00]  He probably doesn't care.  He's probably sick of trying to keep that fucking hair shit.  Keeping that weave thing that he had in his head.  Yeah, he's sick of trying to keep his secrets, too.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's probably.  His wife's side of the secret.  That secret.  It's just enough already.  Enough of your secrets.  Enough.  Kissing that fucking guy on the stairs of that airplane.  Just a bald and sissy.  Just tell everybody.  You've had your time.  I'll fucking just enjoy it.  What happened to that Pulp Fiction hair?  Was that his or his? 
[01:34:30]  No, of course not.  That's just the same speculation as my good friend Brendan Fraser.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Brendan Fraser.  Those pictures are fucked up.  Bruce Willis-y thing going on.  Yeah.  Travolta.  Like, if he just went with it, it wouldn't be that bad.  It's not that bad.  But Bruce Willis, he's disturbing looking with his bald head and his oldness.  He won't put a wig on in movies.  Put a wig on.  He threw some shit on in, I guess, Sixth Sense he had a wig on. 
[01:35:00]  And he's put a wig on a couple of times.  But he's always had a weird hair, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Even in Moonlighting, you saw it.  It was like, oh, that shit's going.  He used to have hair, though.  No, that is not his hair.  That's like, you could see it was going.  That's not his hair.  You think that's already some shit going on?  Yeah, that's receding, and he's like, you think that's some shit going on already? 
[01:35:30]  Seagull feathers in the front of his fucking head.  Seagull feathers.  The fuck out of here.  That was never his hair.  And this mutt, too, fucking Nick Cage's hair.  Yeah, yeah, Nick Cage.  He won't stop with his fucking head.  That's funny.  Yeah, it really is funny.  Oh, which movie was that?  That's the Jackal.  Oh, the Jackal.  Was it?  I think that's the Jackal.  Do you really want him to be wearing wigs?  He has to. 
[01:36:00]  Did you see his cop-out head?  Yeah.  It's just the bald, white head.  Yeah.  It's just not, and that weird nose.  But he's totally accepted being the bald Bruce Willis.  I think he hasn't.  Like, no one looks and goes like, ugh.  No, but I think that's the point Patrice is making.  Now people start to look like, ugh.  He's old.  Yeah.  You know who's getting over with the baldness?  Jason Stratham is getting over somehow being a balding man.  And he's still like a sex symbol somehow.  Because he's not that old. 
[01:36:30]  He's in his 30s.  Yeah.  Once you, you know.  But Bruce is getting old.  Well, he's got dents and stuff in that head.  Yeah.  It's just some dings.  Can I see cop-out head?  Cop-out head.  Cop-out head.  Just look at cop-out head.  Look at that one down there.  Yeah.  It's like.  Wow.  That really does look weird.  It looks like it's caving in on the sides, right?  And it's bulbous.  Yeah.  Look at cop-out head.  It's very bulbous on top.  Cop-out head.  It's bulbous because the sides look like they're caving in. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's just not.  And it never used to look like that.  So, put your eyes on to something.  And The Rock got a strange bald head.  Rock was shaving his hairline back until now he has to.  It was good.  No one wants to see a balding.  Oh, The Rock.  A balding Samoan.  The Rock.  Is he going bald all the time now?  Yeah, I think he's going bald.  He is, yeah.  He doesn't have that great head of hair.  What's, uh...  Wait a minute.  God is great, though, because he'll make a guy like Rock bald just to make me feel better. 
[01:37:30]  Just to fuck at him.  What's going on with David Spade?  You see him in those commercials?  It's like, his hair now is just bizarre.  Like, you can't figure out what is happening with it.  Well, I was...  Like, look at that picture.  He's got the biggest sweep on the front there.  Dude, I was told years ago by a very reliable source that he is as bald as they come.  Really?  Yes. 
[01:38:00]  I heard that years ago when we were at N.E.W.  He was bald then?  That's why, you know, a lot of these movies he's wearing bandanas and stuff, like, in water parks.  Because he's kind of got to keep it all together, yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, I heard that.  I heard from a very reliable source that is a major hair system, and he's had it for a really long time.  And where's he gone?  What's he doing with the, like...  He's had that same, like, long kid hair for a while. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, well...  Well, wouldn't you?  Why would you get hair cut that ain't gonna grow anymore?  Yeah, you can't cut hair that's not gonna grow anymore.  Exactly.  It's the fake hair.  If you glue mattress stuffing on the top, it's not like you can go have it fucking shaked up.  Do you remember old school?  I had one.  I think most people listening right now could relate to this.  Like, you had the boss that had the two hair systems.  Patrice, you ever have a boss with the two hair systems, and then he would wait for a long weekend to change it up and go with the long version? 
[01:39:00]  Oh, the long hair?  Like, hey, it's growing.  Hey, it's my hair cut.  Oh, boy.  And then fast forward, maybe it's summer vacation, he comes back with the short version?  Yeah.  And he thought no one noticed that he had two hair systems?  But a guy in hair could still...  It's like a woman...  Sometimes you see those Indian ladies that are losing their hair?  Oh, my God.  I think that must be just devastating, man.  That's fucked up.  Well, it looks like they're going through chemo.  It's devastating.  They're losing it in a fucking weird way. 
[01:39:30]  There's the patchy ones that just fall out in patches, but then there's also, like, some women get male pattern baldness.  No, that's the problem.  Like, when guys lose their hair, you lose it in such a way that you could almost deal with it.  But when women start losing their hair, it's like it comes out in clumps...  It's like the mange.  Yeah, like that.  There you go.  It just comes out in clumps in areas that maybe it shouldn't be falling out of.  Oh, man.  I feel bad for women that go bald.  Oh, shit.  That's one of those things that hurt my heart, though, because you just know it's so bad.  Oh, shit.  It's so bad. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, what can she do?  They try to tease it up and spray it, and you can see right through it.  It's like cotton candy.  Look at this poor lady right here.  Look at her just recognizing that her hair's a mess.  Just trying.  And she's young and pretty.  It's just sad.  Oh, man.  And not having hair makes you look so much older.  It's just...  Yeah, yeah.  It's important.  I'm deciding whether I'm going to start putting Sharpie ink in my shit because it's going gray.  Sharpie ink?  Is that...  I don't fucking break open Sharpie ink. 
[01:40:30]  Ah, shit.  Because this gray just makes you feel old, man.  Yeah, they're gray any time.  And they haven't figured out the hair system for black guys.  Yeah.  I think they did, yeah.  There was a guy on TV that used to wear this, like, Afro helmet or something.  Oh, God.  That was fucking crazy.  I forgot his name.  I think it was a sports guy.  That hair club for men or something.  They had a black guy in there.  Yeah, yeah.  They figured out for the black guys.  Not too much because it's hard to just put the pubic hair, fucking curly hair, and shove it in a follicle. 
[01:41:00]  This is easy to deal with mop hair as opposed to fucking broom hair.  Ha, bro, man.  I seen you on fucking Joey Behar.  Yours is fucking...  Yeah, mine actually worked.  Because I wasn't, like, completely fucking bald.  I noticed I was thinning.  But you...  Did you make sure that your baldness...  The baldness that you had was it?  Yeah, it was taking years. 
[01:41:30]  Like, for years, I'd look and go,  That's thinning out a little bit.  And then, like, ten years later, I'd be like,  Yeah, that's thinning out, man.  So you think you're done with...  You have still...  Your natural hair you have.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I pop, you know, the Propecia just in case.  What's Propecia?  Yeah, it's that fucking...  It's supposed to keep your hair.  It's like it keeps it at the status quo.  Makes your boners weird.  Now, do you get...  Makes your boners weird.  Do you get, um...  Do you get haircuts?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:42:00]  But they leave the other shit alone, though, right?  No, it's all the same.  It's all fucking regular growing fucking hair.  It grows?  You didn't know that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fucking...  It's your regular hair.  They take it from the back here.  So what made it stop growing in the first place?  Just on certain areas, like in the front and in the back,  it would, uh...  It would, like...  Your hair falls out when you shed your hair,  and then it would grow back, like, thinner and smaller and shit, 
[01:42:30]  and then it keeps doing that.  And that's when guys go bald.  So what they do is they...  It's like sod.  They transplant it.  So they take it from the back where it doesn't go bald.  It takes the whole root.  People...  You ever see people, like, completely balding at the horseshoe?  So they transfer live hair to your...  Yeah.  But how is...  But what happened to the follicles to where your other hair died?  Oh, that was just...  That just sits there.  But they put new shit in the same area.  And it's living.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you understand the question, though?  Like, what...  When they put the living hair in the other hair, 
[01:43:00]  what's keeping...  What's the nourishment to keep that hair living and growing?  Blood flow.  It's the same thing.  They just...  They take out...  Blood flow in the hair?  When they take out the hair,  they don't take out, like, a thing of hair  and just stick it in your head.  They carve out a swath of your scalp.  They scalp you.  Oh, so you had to, like, heal.  And then they...  Oh, yeah.  This is major surgery.  It took, like, 12 hours of laying on a fucking table  with my head numb with Novocaine watching movies. 
[01:43:30]  And then they take a big swath out, like this,  and then they dissect the swath and cut all the fucking tissue.  And they take hairs with just one hair,  and then clumps with two, and clumps with three.  And then the ones are used, like, in the front, like, hairline shit.  And then the twos and threes are used to fill out areas,  and then it just heals and becomes your fucking...  And then when does the stuff that they...  It's fucked up. 
[01:44:00]  When does the stuff that they cut from the back heal again and start to grow?  Oh, that...  No, they gotta get...  They gotta, like...  What they do...  Yeah.  They take it out...  They gotta close that area.  And then they just go...  And stitch it closed, so it's like it never existed.  And then...  But that's still living.  Oh, no.  I see.  Yeah, they don't put anything there.  So that's why your eyebrows are a little higher than when I first mentioned it.  My eyebrows got higher.  I know, because that's what I was asking.  I'm like, wait a minute.  You just closed that shit up?  Isn't that why y'all look surprising?  I'm like, fuck! 
[01:44:30]  God damn, what the fuck?  I'm from the back of my head.  I don't know how they would do that.  It's like...  Like, squeeze it together.  But your scalp can stretch.  Your skin stretches, so it just fucking...  It's just amazing they figured that shit out.  They don't take a fucking six inches out, you know?  So you have a fucking...  Like a really funky scar back there.  But you hand her over it.  No, it's pretty fucking...  It's pretty like fucking hairline.  The only time you see the scars...  They're doing shit like that.  ...is when these guys end up, you know, shaving their head completely.  Shaving their head.  I'm not shaving my head.  You've seen that ugly scar behind on some guys, right? 
[01:45:00]  I think Jamie Foxx has it.  Yeah.  I think Jamie Foxx had it done, and you could see the scar on the back of his head because  he shaves his head.  Jamie Foxx was going bald?  Yeah, I think so.  You could find Jamie Foxx...  He does have that scar.  Jamie Foxx hair scar or something.  When you've got money, you can just do things for yourself, man.  It's like, fuck it.  Damn.  Yeah, that was like, you know, I think 12 grand or something like that.  I guess that's the same thing with teeth.  Fuck it.  It's like...  Yeah, yeah.  That's well-spent money right there.  I gotta get that done. 
[01:45:30]  I was looking at my mouth and I was just like, shit.  I've been looking into laminates.  Get that toilet mouth like Voss.  When I have my fucking...  You got the bad teeth.  When I have my...  I just never gave a fuck.  I cracked it when...  I cracked my tooth when I was like nine and never got it fixed.  It just was there.  And then I started...  There was a time where I had anxiety and I would grind my teeth at night.  Oh, shit.  And I grinded them till...  Till I couldn't grind them no more.  It just was a mess.  So with fame calls, you might have to get new teeth for Hollywood.  I think with fame calls, I think I at least have to get that. 
[01:46:00]  I think I have to at least do what some of them do, is just get the top done.  And then the bottom was like...  And they just got the top done.  You ever see the undone bottom ones, you pieces of shit?  That's just someone that ran out of money.  You see that shit all the time.  Do you see the Jamie 5?  Did you find one with the scar or something?  No.  You ever see the guys with...  They have the one or two lines of new hair because they ran out of money.  They can't get the whole thing fucking seated?  Oh, no.  That's the old school shit that... 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, that might be it.  No, the old school hair plugs.  If you look at the Olsen twins' manager, this is the worst thing that happened to people years ago.  They would get hair plugs.  It's different than what they're doing now.  They would take like a pencil eraser-sized coring tool and just take plugs out of your head that was the size of pencil erasers and then shove them in new holes that they made in the front of your head.  And you'd go bald behind it and get these things that look like doll hair. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, so that...  Those are plugs.  That's old school.  Oh, so you can...  If you have money, you don't have to look like that?  No!  They don't even do that anymore.  Now they do individual follicles to keep it looking natural.  What was your procedure called so I can see what it...  It was just a...  What was it?  Fucking...  Where did I have it done?  Bosley?  Is the company even around anymore?  It's just hair transplant.  Look at how bad that looks.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Holy shit. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Can I see hair transplant?  Was there like...  Yeah, like Bosley or fucking...  They still around?  Is this a billion dollar business?  Men's hair now.  Yeah, yeah.  They like...  Some people are too far gone, so it's like...  Oh, Kenny Rogers had it done.  Kenny Rogers had it done.  Kenny Rogers had a lot of work done.  Pat O'Brien.  Pat O'Brien is a member.  Look at TC, motherfucker.  Yeah, he got that shit taken care of.  TC?  She's straight.  TC. 
[01:48:00]  TC, motherfucker.  Yeah, some guys are way too far gone, so it's like thin.  It looks like when they first started going bald instead of...  They're totally bald, but...  Yeah.  Do you have to be rich?  Yeah, I think you got it.  You need some cash.  You need some disposable income.  I think they take payment plans.  You come and repossess your fucking hair.  Some guy just comes and takes his fist and grips it right out of your head.  They just hire ex-wives.  But if you're just, like, thinning, it works pretty well. 
[01:48:30]  If you're completely horseshoe bald, then, you know, they can't find enough hair on the  back of your head.  Well, Michu fucking Cock who got it done.  Michu Cock.  Yeah, he was totally gone.  Damn, that was a good one, because he looked like a fucking...  He looked like riffraff.  ...orchestral conductor, and then he went to...  Yeah.  ...retired swimmer.  Much better look.  Ah, shit.  Wow, this guy was 30 years younger than you.  It is amazing how old you fucking look. 
[01:49:00]  That was the deal.  It's just, you gotta fucking, you know, if you can...  Wow, man.  ...if you have the means, I highly recommend it.  Six figures, low six, high fives?  No, it's just 12,000.  Yeah, he said 12.  12,000 bucks.  That seems cheap.  12 Gs.  That seems cheap as far as getting, you know, new hair.  Yeah.  How many procedures?  How many times do you have to go back?  One day.  One day, it's done.  You're going early in the morning, you leave at night.  It's fucking crazy. 
[01:49:30]  And you have to sleep, sit, standing up?  They tell you...  Like, in a coffin?  It's like, don't do whatever you have to do to not sneeze.  Like, you're fucking...  Oh, fuck.  People have had, like, their fucking implant things just shoot out of their head.  Oh, fuck.  Don't, like, don't put your head between your legs.  How long?  No, like, sex.  You can't do anything to have, like, your heart rate up.  How long?  Uh, for, like, maybe five days.  You got to just...  Until it, like, sets.  Just chill out and find.  Yeah.  Until, like...  And then it, like, scabs over.  Until it sets.  Until it sets like a window tint? 
[01:50:00]  It's got...  Don't roll your windows down until the tint sets.  Pretty much.  Ah, shit.  You fucking get in the refrigerator?  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus Christ, man.  That's so...  It seems so fucking violent.  And then I had to wear, like, a bandana on my head.  How about a shower?  Uh, yeah, showering you could do, like, after, I think, three days.  But you had to take a washcloth with, like, just a special shampoo and kind of wet your 
[01:50:30]  hair with a cup.  You didn't let the shower nozzle hit you.  And wet your hair with, like, a cup real slightly.  And then take the soapy washcloth, put it over your head, and just kind of touch it.  Oh, fuck that.  And touch it and touch it.  You know what's hilarious?  And then wash it off with the cup again.  This is...  These are the mistakes that...  They didn't just know that.  This was...  This was like, okay, some guy came back with his fucking...  Like, shampoo in his hair.  Just meat clumps.  Fucking...  And the drain. 
[01:51:00]  And they're like, well...  Oh, shit.  You had to stay there.  They just had to fucking actually watch you and say, okay, better not do that.  See what you're doing?  You had to sleep like the elephant man sitting up where you'd fucking suffocate.  As your head is falling apart.  Like an Indiana Jones villain's head.  Like you opened the arc too fucking early.  And it's just melted in the shower.  And you're just like, holy shit.  Like that guy in Poltergeist that looks in the mirror and just starts picking his fucking 
[01:51:30]  face apart.  That's how your head fucking just chopped meat.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man, dude.  God damn.  Imagine how much shit they had to do before they got it perfect.  Before they realized what you shouldn't do when you're doing this.  Now, did you fuck up any time where you go, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Did I fuck up?  No, no.  I was really cool with it.  And I think we were on vacation at the time.  Yeah.  Because it was during, like, Thanksgiving or something.  So we had that whole week.  I was off for vacation.  So I didn't have to worry about, like, coming in here or anything.  I could really be mellow. 
[01:52:00]  What's that?  Ba-ba-ba-boom.  There was that interesting period of time where you were rocking the bandana for a while.  I had to wear the bandana, yeah.  Because it was really bad.  Keep on rocking in the free world.  And that's another bad thing is they had to actually shave.  Oh, where's their video?  They had to shave the area of your head where they were implanting these fucking things.  So you feel bad enough that it's like, oh, you know, yeah, I'm thinning in the back, in here, in the front.  And then they had to shave it in order to do the implanting. 
[01:52:30]  So now you're like a monk.  You look like a monk with the back shaved and shit and everywhere they put it in, shaved.  And then it grows back in.  How long did it take for your hair to go back in the back?  It was, in the back, it's instant because it's closed up.  It just sealed that up.  It just started growing.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  He's still missing out.  They take that out and then they squeeze it together.  No, but I'm saying, so how long did that area start before you, that was, that star heels?  Oh, that was like, that was not a week.  By a week, you're not even fucking dealing with it. 
[01:53:00]  Pay attention to that.  They take the stitches out.  You go back, you go back like a week or so later, a week and a half, and they take the stitches out.  And then the thing, yeah, that would be me rocking the bandana.  Yeah, and people are going, I'm shooting a Desert Eagle in this, at the range.  And they're going, is that popping follicles out of your head when that fucking gun goes off?  Oh, my God.  And then I really started thinking, like, wow, maybe, maybe they're right.  I shouldn't shoot that gun.  That was a hell of a look, man.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I look like a fucking gangbanger.  Holy shit.  And when you sneeze your hair, it's like one of those party things. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, bon voyage.  Like a bang gun, a fake bang gun.  And now it's just...  Yeah, now I put a hat on, especially in the morning, because my hair is a wreck from the night.  I've never been able to actually sleep without waking up looking like Medusa.  Yeah, you're graying a little bit now.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that hair graying, too?  Nah, graying the sides in the temple, on my temples.  But the top is...  The top is fine.  I got grays in there and shit, but usually if I'm doing TV, I go down to, like, Johnson 
[01:54:00]  Hogg and have them touch it up a little, because TV gray looks so bad.  But also where they got the hair from, that area usually doesn't get gray, or it gets gray  later.  Yeah, it's that...  You know where they get the hair from?  The temples get really gray.  When you see someone that's totally bald, and they got that horseshoe ring of hair, that  is genetically, will never fall out.  It's just genetically pre-programmed that that horseshoe of hair, you never go balder than  that.  So that hair is always fine. 
[01:54:30]  So when they cut that swath out, that's from the patch of hair that will, is genetically  predestined to not fall out of your head.  So when they pop it in, it doesn't come...  It won't go bald.  Fuck that.  That's what they told you.  That was the line they saw make.  I wrote a check, motherfucker.  That's the greatest $12,000 line.  And it fucking still works, so I don't care.  I'm going to pick me some $12,000 lines.  And that fucking shit starts dropping out like goddamn...  It starts falling out like fucking shredded weed. 
[01:55:00]  Shredded weed, yeah.  I'm scared if I do it, and then there's erosion, and then it becomes its own island.  That's what I was asking you, Mike.  And that's why you asked, you know, you were sure that the...  Yeah, yeah, because like I said, I wasn't...  That the fade was done.  I wasn't like fucking...  I was old enough where I realized like, all right, I wasn't going to go totally bald,  but I just didn't want to have like thinning and shit, and spots and stuff.  And I didn't wind up saying, hey, could you make a head of hair that looks like it did 
[01:55:30]  when I was 20?  You know, didn't do that.  Good luck.  You know, I didn't want that.  I needed a, you know, to look age appropriate, and it worked.  Oh, Danny, can we stop talking about this, please?  Oh, shit.  Is Danny like, uh...  I was going to go ask Danny about that, too.  Was you thinking about it?  No.  I don't have the mic for that, but...  I mean, if you did, wouldn't you?  They take payment plans.  Yeah, but you look fine, man.  Some guys, it just looks fine. 
[01:56:00]  It bothers you?  Well, no.  I don't think there's anybody.  I think...  You're right.  You're right.  I think every guy is bothered by it.  It looks like you lost yours in a fight.  Like...  Like, his looked like it was lost.  Somebody cut him up with some, and...  Like, you could lie about how you lost your hair.  It doesn't just look like regular...  Mine's going in a weird, deep triangle, man.  Oh, sure.  A weird, deep triangle.  A weird, deep triangle.  Like, it's...  You'll be too old to care when you're trying to be.  I'm starting to think that.  I'm hoping.  But I've been taking a peek at it. 
[01:56:30]  I see my coming attraction right there.  It works out pretty well.  Mine is starting from here, and then it's a triangle.  So, from the middle of the head...  It's going to be...  And triangling out toward, like, your eyes...  And then it also looks like it might be, like, a four-inch part.  Who wants to live with a four-inch part?  Not a Phil Collins, right?  No.  Complete four-inch part.  Oh, like down the...  Yes.  Where you...  Like the opposite mohawk.  Where you would want more to leave or less to leave. 
[01:57:00]  Right, right.  It's that weird in between.  And you have a refusal to, like, do your hair in a different way to kind of cover it up, too.  Like, you have regular, you know, white guy style.  You're not trying to, like...  I don't know what I could do with that.  I definitely have lost a bunch.  Why don't you just grease it back like fucking Gordon Gekko or something?  Gordon Gekko, yeah.  It would be so obvious at that point.  My haircutter says just keep it short.  I'm at that stage where you can keep it...  I don't see it, though.  I don't see where it's, you know...  You keep it short, you could cover up some hurt. 
[01:57:30]  I would love to grow my hair out again.  I used to like having...  And white guys, man, you have light hair, so it's easy.  You can go bald in the summer.  See what you blacks do to us?  It's from worry.  It's so much worry in our life from you black people.  Wait, blacks go bald slowly?  It's like...  We can lose our hair in the summer.  We lose...  One summer?  We can go Memorial Day to Labor Day. 
[01:58:00]  You go bald at 19.  Like, it's rare you see a bald 19-year-old black guy.  Dude, I had a friend in a school that just, like, was...  He was going bald in high school.  And you're like, oh...  And then he...  By the 20s, completely gone.  The big thing in my school, we had a kid that was going gray as a senior.  Like, holy...  There's always those freaks of nature.  And then I saw him literally the next year, and he was more gray than that, at 19.  I came from Connecticut saying, well, blacks do everything more slowly than whites so many. 
[01:58:30]  It's really good.  Really?  You just go, really?  Really?  Is that what it is?  All right, we've got to take a break.  Patrice's DVD is out today.  Yeah.  Even if you saw the special over the weekend, it's 45 more minutes of material.  Yeah, man.  And some...  It's the segues that make the jokes make sense.  After the edits?  Yeah, after I come from a commercial, and now I'm talking about animals, where I was 
[01:59:00]  talking about titties, and there's one before, so...  The segway is very important, and also, worth the price of admission, is you railing on  that bitch in the audience.  Oh, you had the DVD?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You watched the whole DVD?  Yeah.  How was that?  I didn't see the whole...  It's fucking great.  It is fucking great.  You saw the whole fucking thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was worried they wouldn't have you going after that girl.  That's on a DVD?  That was a long bit.  Oh, it's...  But it couldn't be part of the special, because it was too raw.  It's brutally funny.  Like, it's brutal, but it's so funny. 
[01:59:30]  And you get the boyfriend, or the guy that she ain't fucking, whatever he is, you get  him to completely take your side of it.  Do you understand that he tweeted me?  He did.  That guy, and said, thank you.  He said, dude, you're right about that girl.  You're absolutely right.  You have a knack of looking at people in an audience, because you're doing your act, I  don't think people think you're paying attention to them.  So when you're looking at them, and you call someone out, you fucking bam, bam, bam, and 
[02:00:00]  let everyone know what they're all about in one sentence.  But do you know what that, because it's the difference between TV, because you get a lot  of people that come to a comedy show, and think they're watching Comedy Central.  Yeah.  Like, you go, like, in Houston, this little fucking douchey little white kid with his  family, with just being, like, whatever.  I go, you know what's weird, man?  I mean, not that I'm threatening you, but you just have, there's nothing in you that says 
[02:00:30]  I'm a fucking big black dude that could slap this shit out of you.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Like, something's fucked you up.  There's not a wall up here, dude.  And I'm not threatening you, kid.  I'm just saying, you gotta understand, here's how close I could be to you, and you're being  disrespectful.  And you don't know.  Because you can turn, for me, you know.  So, like, doing crowd stuff, but when I was doing it, that girl, her face was anti-lasting.  Oh, yes.  I said, I'm not being this unfunny.  I said, you're just being a little cunt.  Yeah.  Oh, it was classic. 
[02:01:00]  It was great.  I'm glad you saw that.  I'm glad you saw that DVD.  So, I'm glad you saw that DVD, because it's like, because there's one part that I wanted  to be in the show, desperately, but it was just talking about guys not caring about  their woman's health.  It's just, I wanted that to be on the special on TV so bad.  That is fucking great, yeah.  Just talking about how you've never had your man go, when's your fucking Ghana, your pussy  doctor appointment.  Your pussy doctor.  Sweetie, when is your pussy doctor appointment? 
[02:01:30]  Have you checked your breasts for lunch lately?  Never.  Ever.  Have we ever gave a fuck about a woman's health?  It's on the DVD.  It ain't like you don't give a fuck.  You just go, oh shit, I've never asked my girl.  I don't think about it.  My girl goes to the doctor, she says, I got a doctor's appointment.  Well, good luck.  Okay.  Not what is it for?  What doctor?  What do you need?  What do you got?  Is it the checkup?  Is it nothing?  Oh, okay.  That's it.  You've been taking care of yourself?  If you said, yeah, I'm going to the doctor, what, sweetie, what do you, what doctor? 
[02:02:00]  There you go.  Let's break.  So, you get the DVD and all the regular places.  Oh, yeah.  So, Patrice's DVD is out today.  Elephant in the room.  Yes.  More with Patrice, and I think Kurt Metzger is stopping by today to say hi.  Kurt Metzger.  He's here?  All right, he'll join the show next.  Stay there.  Kurt, big.  Oh, funk.  Do, do, do, do.  Of course, we've got Big Mama Prods, Patrice O'Neill in studio. 
[02:02:30]  His DVD is out today.  Make sure you check that out.  Elephant in the room.  Most of us saw it on Comedy Central on Saturday night, but there's 45 minutes of material you  have not seen, and some just unbelievable stuff on the DVD.  Stuff that should have made the special, but because of time restraints and all sorts  of shit.  So, make sure you pick up the DVD today.  Also, Kurt Metzger in studio.  Yes.  Metzger.  Metzger.  Patrice is telling us all about you.  During the break. 
[02:03:00]  What'd he say?  He's saying you got a big hog, and he's also saying you got a good clit joke.  But Kurt, Kurt, Kurt is fucking, he's in the next echelon of the young gangsters coming  up.  Yeah, really?  Pushing, pushing the old fellas out.  Yeah.  You should get more work, then.  He's a fucking weirdo.  He's a natural weirdo.  That's his problem.  Like a real weirdo?  No.  Eight foot tall, strange man.  Patrice makes me nervous sometimes.  Why?  You know what?  Patrice made me nervous for years, to be completely honest with you. 
[02:03:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I brought up...  You never knew that?  You're intense.  Yeah.  What?  I swear to God.  It's been a while.  It's been a bunch of years now.  I take care of it.  I always tell Kurt.  I'm a big fan of Patrice.  I'm just like...  Kurt's a fucking beast.  I was intimidated by Patrice probably the first three years you did this show.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what it was.  Dude, that's special.  But you're just lovable, Patrice.  Elephant in the room, my girl that you pissed off at the barbecue because you told her dress  was inappropriate or something. 
[02:04:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  She's dressed like a whore like I love you.  She hated Patrice ever since then.  She made us watch it twice in a row.  Really?  Elephant in the room.  How bad was the dress?  I was teasing her.  It was like American Apparel horse shit.  It all girls were.  It wasn't like...  I'm like, how can you be with a comic and not have a sense of humor?  Yeah.  Like, I tell my girl to calm down if people fuck with you because, you know...  Yeah, but it's not...  She's got like a...  She had to wear like a back brace or something in high school, you know? 
[02:04:30]  So she's like...  She's got like this weird complex that she's being made fun of, you know?  I have a fuck that way of like picking out exactly what's going to make somebody really  horrible...  It was really immediate.  Like, why are you so mad right now?  He just hit her like right in the...  Right in the floor.  Because he always goes for the one thing.  He knows.  What?  I didn't know that he knows.  Scoliosis?  You felt it.  I just didn't know.  You felt it.  I didn't know the motherfucker and his damn girl had fucking bad backs.  I just took it like he thought she was hot and like trying to knock her down a peg, 
[02:05:00]  which I love that he does with hot chicks because I'm racist against hot chicks in general.  And he would really...  I mean, it's really great to just bring a girl around here and have him go to town on  it.  Just have her get smashed?  Yeah.  She was already knocked down a peg from life before she got out.  I'll tell you why Kurt's good, though.  Kurt...  Kurt...  I don't know why it isn't...  What happened?  Oh, Kurt was starting to get his own thing going.  That's what happened because Kurt would...  I've been Kurt on the road a couple of times.  Mm-hmm.  But I would find myself...  I'd go, Kurt's good because I would find myself watching and being into his act all the way 
[02:05:30]  to the end and I got to go on after him.  Oh, shit.  So I had to go get into character.  I'd be like, shit, I got to get into character.  But he'd be saying some shit and one of the jokes...  I don't do it justice.  I don't want to be corny, but you do it.  That was about the African story.  That was about the clip thing.  Yeah, could you just say that?  I don't...  It just...  It made me laugh so hard.  I'm putting pressure on him to be funny with this shit.  Well, acknowledge that there's some pressure.  Yeah.  What is that, Kurt?  The thing he likes is the end of it because I used to live at an African store in Brooklyn.  It was like a real place and there was a sign that would say African supplies on the 
[02:06:00]  store that used to creep the hell out of it.  Yeah, one of those.  You know, what the hell?  That can't be good, right?  You're like, all right, I need a machete with bloody hair on it.  I need an army uniform for a five-year-old.  I need a sharp rock to circumcise my daughter.  And then everybody gets mad.  I'm like, listen, I'm not pro-female circumcision unless you have one of the giant clits that  I hate.  It's like a small dick.  Then just like, you know, don't use a rock.  Just a little off the top.  And get like that petty paw.  That petty paw. 
[02:06:30]  And just.  And just.  She wants the daisies.  Just work it down.  So you look like a human.  And not some kind of a.  A giant clit.  Just like.  A fucking animal's.  An animal just clawed.  It's too long.  Oh my God, dude.  I was with this Puerto Rican girl one time.  And she was hot too.  But she had her clit.  I mean, I looked at it.  It looked like a miniature dick.  Like a miniature dick.  It had the little.  Mushroom head on it.  Like a head on it.  Jimmy's all.  He's not here to defend himself.  But he would agree.  He loves that.  He is into that.  He loves that shit.  Me and Anna.  A giant clit.  Giant clits are sexy, man. 
[02:07:00]  No, me and Anna.  No, the ones he likes.  We just never understood over the years.  The little baby penis.  He looks like a little fucking.  A little penis.  Mini dicks.  Yeah, the mini dick.  Yeah, it looks like he's looking back at himself.  There it is.  It's the dewclaw.  Yeah, it's the dewclaw.  She had a clit like a dewclaw.  She had a clit like a dewclaw.  That's it.  I thought you were talking about that.  There's a million comics going to go out tonight to try to get their fucking rights to dewclaw.  The dewclaw.  What the fuck is that claw used for anymore? 
[02:07:30]  That's like that.  The whole of cigarettes back when they were up.  Evolution just hasn't gotten to that claw yet.  I'll tell you exactly what that claw is used for.  When you put rubber bands around his snout, he uses that to take the shit off.  Oh, man.  It's his thumb.  Yeah, it's like his thumb.  What's that mess above that called?  That's that pad thing.  What is that used for?  It's the foot pads, man.  You know?  No, that.  I know.  It's their natural shoes.  That's called the labia majora.  That's way up on the lab. 
[02:08:00]  It surrounds the dewclaw.  It probably had something to do with fucking when they were ripping apart a caveman's throat.  It was easier to fucking hold on or something.  Yeah, it was padded.  It didn't slip on blood.  Who's the top fives now?  Who's the young soldiers now?  They got you?  Uh, Hannibal.  Who else?  Who's the...  Who's your crew?  No, not the crew, but the...  Not the crew, why not the crew?  There's no carnival, but...  You sort of had your...  I don't...  You had your guys.  It was a tough crowd crew, but who's his circle?  There's no circles. 
[02:08:30]  No more circles.  It's what Comedy Central and the scene...  Oh, the hot list?  Yeah, who's in the scene?  Well, it was the real hot list, not a made-up list by someone.  It was me, Reggie Watts, and the people...  Is Reggie...  Is Reggie Watts in New York?  I don't know.  He's always...  If he is, he's always doing a room.  I never met him, and it's like fucking...  I watched him, and I, you know...  I like him, because he looks like a Where the Wild Things Are creature.  I don't...  I was like...  I hear about him.  Somebody's like, oh, Reggie Watts. 
[02:09:00]  But he's like a beatboxer and a DJ or something.  Yeah, it's not a...  I mean...  It's not like stand-up.  It's like a...  I hate how unfunny you can be and still be in the comedy game.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm not saying Reggie Watts is unfunny.  No, I've seen it.  It's just this thing where there's a comfort zone that some of these young comics have.  I'm watching some of the new...  I keep up with who's out there.  I do.  You have to.  And I'm watching all the new Comedy Central specials. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  And it's just these young guys, you know, with long, unpronounceable names.  Right.  They're just comfortable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're comfy.  They do well and...  Yeah, they all learn the same rhythms, dude, in those rooms.  And then they just talk that way.  I'm going to not put pressure on myself because this is supposed to be funny if you laugh.  I don't want to reek of effort right now.  No, no, no, no, no.  You know what was a big thing back in, like, the 80s and early 90s?  Yeah, yeah.  That you don't see anymore that I didn't think ever fit into comedians is the team, the two 
[02:10:00]  guys that would get up there and do a team act.  People still do that all the time, man, dude.  I still fucking can't see you do one of those games.  Two guys combined are half as funny as one guy.  You still got the Scolars.  It's amazing.  Oh, well, yeah.  I think the Scolars brothers...  The Scolars brothers might be the last team, but they're twin brothers, so you can't really...  It's like the Smothers...  It worked with the Smothers brothers back in the 60s when everyone was laughing at anything.  And Paul Mooney's kids, the Mooney twins. 
[02:10:30]  Really?  They do...  Well, you know, the Smothers brothers had, like, one guy was dumb, and now people just finish  each other's sentences, like...  Yeah, is that what the thing is?  He's doing cunts, yeah.  I just don't enjoy this new...  I don't have to be funny thing.  Yeah.  They prefer if you're not.  But it's not irony.  It's just...  No.  I just did a show.  And you don't get it.  You didn't laugh because you didn't get it.  No, I'll tell you what it is, dude.  It's the one...  That whole scene of Alternative is controlled by chicks. 
[02:11:00]  These awful chicks that look like Carmen Sandiego with, like, glasses and wig haircuts.  Thank you.  And they control that scene.  By the way, why Kurt's having a bad time, because Kurt is...  That's what he'll say.  That's what people don't understand.  That's how you don't get in, is you trash who trash...  Ah, okay.  And you take them back to high school.  Like, they...  I'm like a...  I was always a nerd.  I was like a jock when I go to those rooms.  I was like, oh, God.  This is like a rapist slash bear to them.  Just because I'm not doing complete bullshit. 
[02:11:30]  I mean complete bullshit.  Because they're smart enough...  Here's the thing.  They're smart enough to do material that they know is interesting.  But they know it's like a woman doing edgy shit, but it's not really...  They're not really edgy.  You're right.  They know that edgy's...  It's just like anything else they do that they challenge men.  They play basketball, and it stinks.  But they know that they're going to be getting credit because they're girls.  So if you're sort of funny as a girl, you'll get credit. 
[02:12:00]  But these girls, they come on with this...  Yeah, man.  The hottest comic I've ever seen.  It's like you go...  First of all, what's her name?  Schlesinger?  She's so sexy.  I couldn't tell you one of her jokes.  Pop her up there.  You go, why are you funny?  When did you need to be funny?  Because this bitch is going with the biggest natural titties you've ever fucking seen.  What's her name, Travis?  Elijah Schlesinger.  Elijah Schlesinger.  It's unbelievable. 
[02:12:30]  You can't even resent her if she, like, bumps you on a show or something.  I like what you just said.  When did you need to be funny?  Because you guys all had something that...  Some horrible thing that happened to you in your lives that made you need to be funny.  It's rare you get a really good looking...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but this picture's not even doing a job.  No, it's not...  No, that's pretty nice right there.  And she wears tight shit, too.  Yeah, she's, like, hot.  She's funny.  That's pretty nice right there.  I don't think I've ever seen her.  Oh, dude.  I've seen the face.  Last time I was standing, she went on, and the camera would, like, pan...  Look at this fucking girl.  Oh, my God.  It's a comic. 
[02:13:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, dude.  She sits in this room, and it's like, really, am I gonna...  Really, sweetie?  You know how funny you gotta be?  As funny as I have to be at a Klan meeting, like...  Like, hold on, guys.  Hold on.  No.  Seriously.  I'm a funny motherfucker.  Fucker, wait a minute.  Put that shit down.  I'm really funny.  Any clips?  There you go.  That's what she...  That's how she does her comedy?  With her belly.  With the hippo stick.  Her badge is, like, almost showing.  She has some good badge showcasing dresses she wears. 
[02:13:30]  Damn.  I could never get past the deaf broad.  Like, I'm like, you're not as funny as that awful...  That's terrible.  What the bonnet thing?  Knock, knock, knock.  Shit, bitch.  That deaf girl episode on Seinfeld, when she goes...  When he's like, what are you, deaf or something?  And she goes, bingo.  It's like, oh, shuck.  Didn't she get run over on the beach?  Who?  I think we laughed for days over her.  Who, this chick?  No, the deaf comic.  Oh, the deaf comic.  I think she got hit by a fucking beach patrol guy. 
[02:14:00]  Is she alive?  Is she alive?  Yeah.  Oh, for sure.  Dude, this goes back about three or four years.  We laughed for weeks.  She was big in the scene, too.  But there was another one.  A dude.  Twitter, help me out today.  What's her name?  A Spanish guy that was in a wheelchair dude who has cerebral palsy that used to force you  to have to listen to him.  I hate that shit.  I hate who that is.  He was famous.  He did the rounds.  Yeah, I know who you're talking about.  There is some shit you're just not cut out for.  Like, obviously, I'm not going to be a football player. 
[02:14:30]  It just isn't going to happen physically.  It just doesn't work out.  No.  So some of these comics should not be comics.  Right.  Because you're instantly taking away the funny when you're reminding everybody of their mortality.  Well, the deaf comic.  Josh Blue was working hard, and he was all right.  So he told me they thought he was faking the palsy to do actual damage.  Like Kaiser says, that's Julian.  Kaiser says something.  At the end of the contest, he walked away all normal. 
[02:15:00]  Are you right?  We can't find the comic?  The deaf comic?  What are we trying?  Verbal.  Eliza.  We're trying to see.  You asked if she was funny.  I've never really.  I've seen her tits, and I turned.  Like, I just go, she could be funny, but I just go, pop that up.  I've never heard a word.  Let's listen to her a little.  Let's try one.  Here we go.  This is what?  Happy birthday, I think it's called?  Oh, happy 4th of July.  Stand at the wacky comic music.  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, tonight. 
[02:15:30]  I saw another bumper sticker the other day.  It said, war is not the answer.  I disagree.  I think war absolutely is the answer.  And if you don't agree with me, happy 4th of July.  I'm just going to hold her super loose.  I'm thinking.  I'm thinking.  People seem to think we won this country in a game of Yahtzee.  I'm not saying bomb it as in people, but we're American.  It's in our history.  It's in our culture.  We love a good fight. 
[02:16:00]  We're into it.  It's in our blood.  But that's why the fucking Irish of Notre Dame, not the negotiating Jews of Brandeis.  What?  I didn't hear.  I didn't hear.  She turned sideways.  Hold on, hold on.  And her ass is fucking beautiful.  It's so beautiful.  Here we go.  Is she good?  I saw that.  Hold on, hold on.  Here we go.  One person in this room.  Redo that joke.  What?  What did she just say?  I don't know.  We got four guys.  One guy.  I know the point.  Yeah, I know the point.  I know the point. 
[02:16:30]  I got it.  But I was staring at her titties and her ass.  You couldn't recite that joke.  I got it.  You know what?  Give me the punchline.  I skimmed it.  The punchline is.  The actual punchline.  Not the overall punchline you just got.  I can't get the wrong one.  That's my point.  Happy 4th of July.  I heard happy 4th of July.  We didn't win this country in the Yahtzee.  I heard that.  Those are the two things I picked up on.  And look at my fucking protruding nipples.  What if she took me out of a dewclaw, dude?  A dewclaw clip.  If she has a dewclaw, I don't care. 
[02:17:00]  Why do girls have dignity if I was her?  Do you know how many balls would just be in my fucking mouth?  They should be.  Executive balls.  Executive balls.  You're so fucking right.  No one's interested in my horrifying nothing balls.  Maybe that was different.  You think I wouldn't let if some fucking horrid woman executive wanted to just take a swipe  of my balls for a special?  Yeah.  You might not.  You'd do that, right?  I think I'm funny.  Fuck dignity.  You know how amazing my pussy is? 
[02:17:30]  That's what I would just be saying all day long.  Look how funny my tit is.  Why am I trying to work and make something out of it?  I would just make sure my tits look good every day.  Yeah.  Pop up another one.  Maybe we were, you know.  You're so right.  All right.  Try to focus.  Yeah, like doggy style.  That sounds a little blue.  All right.  Yeah.  Maybe we can focus on the sex bit.  Oh, my God.  She's bent over in this one.  Wait a minute.  Why did you put up official?  You got to get YouTube where it's like.  Yeah, that's true.  Where she has, she, see, Comedy Central. 
[02:18:00]  No, but we're, we're, wait a minute, wait a minute.  We're right here.  We're right here.  I know, I know, but Comedy Central's not fair to anybody's funniness.  All right, that's fair enough.  That's true.  It's because we don't even know what she's saying because we're distracted by what she looks like.  That's because of the lighting.  Okay, she's at the, okay, she's at the Laugh Factory.  Let's do Hand Job at the Laugh Factory.  There you go.  All right.  She's at the Laugh Factory.  Ideal date.  All right, good point.  Now we're talking.  You know.  But, like, seriously, like, just, I don't have, like, a ton of sex. 
[02:18:30]  I'm going to put that out there because we're, like, the end of it right now.  But, like, you don't, Hand Job, you don't, it doesn't happen as adults.  It's pretty much you make out, you rub a little bit, and then you have sex, or you, you get a beach or something.  I mean, you can't do a Hand Job.  If you pull out a Hand Job, he'd be like, what are you doing?  This tickles, we stop.  So uncomfortable.  You don't do Hand Jobs, right?  And this guy was like, I was like, I don't want to hook up.  I'm, like, I had to go or something.  He's like, come on.  He's like, what about, what about just a Hand Job?  And I was like, I'll tell you what, fucker.  I'll give you a Hand Job. 
[02:19:00]  But it's got to be on my terms.  It's 45 minutes long.  No lotion.  And you don't break eye contact.  That's just, like, more sexy talk, I know.  You're the best.  If you're annoyed, turn it on.  I never talked about this.  This is great.  Look at her ass, dude.  Turn it on him.  Like, as it's about to go, don't he, she might be the hottest comic I've ever seen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it goes back at him.  Can I tell you this? 
[02:19:30]  I had a boyfriend, and now I'm looking back at the story.  There's a reason I don't have one anymore.  When you get the goo on your hand.  What do you think her problem is?  Because, like, when he's right at that stage.  Every comic has a problem.  Like, he's here, just go.  Well, what happens when you're done?  Yeah, we can turn it on.  They get very upset.  What do you think her problem is?  Life has been too easy.  Ah, she's gotten everything based on life.  These comics, this bitch should be, have scars on her soul.  Let me tell you who's funny. 
[02:20:00]  Ruth Buzzy.  Ruth Buzzy.  Because she came up with Don Rickles calling her a fucking ugly cunt.  Lucia Ball, Gilda Radner.  Yeah.  Fucking, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Phyllis Diller?  Phyllis fucking Diller.  Oh, man.  She's fine.  She's fine.  Sean fucking Rivers.  Who, you know, uh.  Ugly broads.  Ugly bitches.  And who's the other one?  Uh, the one that did all the, Lily Tomlin.  Oh, yeah.  These girls, see, it'll get back to her that we was fucking with a little bit, right? 
[02:20:30]  Wasn't really trash.  No, we're not trash.  No, we're not trash.  But I'm saying, it'll get, it'll, she'll take it as a trash.  You can't get past how hot she is.  But it's like, it's like these women don't go through shit.  Because women run shit.  Right.  They don't come up through the fucking rank and file of horror.  Dude, Amy Schumer, hot and funny.  Easy.  Another easy.  Amy Schumer tells people don't.  She's on stage.  I heard stories.  I heard say to guys, you know, don't bring me up like that.  Bitch. 
[02:21:00]  Shut the fuck up.  You know, I'm trying to finger pop you before you come on stage.  Fucking country hoe.  Just get on stage.  Like, you, they don't do nothing.  Just comfortable, bitch.  Talking about yakking niggas off at the beach.  Like, like, giant tits.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  You're supposed to go through war.  Yeah, yeah.  There's supposed to be a lot of, a lot more hurt, I think.  I think, you know what?  I think Amy's funny, though, because she's not as hot as, like, probably she wanted to be.  So she's got that going.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:21:30]  She's funny, dude, honestly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But she has Sarah Palin disease because she's a comic.  People, she's hot for.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, hot for.  Hot for.  Oh, right.  She's, you know what I mean?  What's Sarah Palin disease, exactly?  Or is, is like, people go, woo, Sarah Palin.  But it's, she's hot because, because all the other politician bitches are horrendous.  And also, she's, like, the only hot chick in Alaska, too.  That's what you're saying.  It's just, she's hot.  The only chick in Alaska.  She's hot for, for reasons.  And Amy's a cutie pie, whatever. 
[02:22:00]  But I'm saying, it's just too easy.  It's too easy.  We're going to move back to the deaf comic, Kathy Buckley.  No!  Kathy Buckley.  I remember on our studio, she brought, like, a machine that says, this helps me hear.  And she's doing a fucking act.  You know, when you mean nothing.  About a hearing aid?  And you have to have, she's not funnier than her deafness.  Yes.  Can we get a, we got to get a Kathy Buckley thing.  She looks deaf.  Look at her face.  And was she the one run over by the beach because you can't hear the fucking guy beeping 
[02:22:30]  the horn?  I think it is.  I think it is.  I think we'd laugh for days over that.  Who's a funny handicapped comic?  Do you know anything?  Uh, no.  It's too distracting.  Well, there have to be not, it has to be a certain handicap.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  He's got an emphysema and he's doing it.  He has, he has a disease that you can't.  He's got a lung bubble and he's.  It's just, it's distracting.  Okay.  If you're in a wheelchair, but you're, but you're a regular, fine.  If you have a physical handicap.  Well, who's a wheelchair guy that we laugh at? 
[02:23:00]  None now.  I can't think any.  No.  There's really none.  Has there ever?  Well.  Yeah.  But he had a, it's almost like Josh Blue.  How did they get on stage?  Like if you're a wheelchair, I've never seen access.  There was a guy in Boston.  There's no fucking ramp.  We had to lift him up.  Oh shit.  Really?  His name was Matt, something in Boston.  I stopped lifting him up.  Matt.  That's funny.  A guy that can't stand up named Matt.  We stand up, sat out.  And he, he got heavier. 
[02:23:30]  Like he wouldn't even try to pretend to be lighter when we would lift him on stage.  He would almost sink down harder to have us have trouble getting him on.  I said, I'm not bliffing you on stage anymore, you fucking dead man, you piece of shit.  He's purposely eating unhealthy.  Fuck you.  Couldn't go on a diet, so it was easier for you guys.  Fuck him.  But cerebral palsy is very difficult.  Josh Blue, I think, is kind of funny.  What?  I can't.  I thought he was far too.  I can't get past.  I can't get past the distraction.  Yeah.  I can't.  I can't get past. 
[02:24:00]  And when I went to that.  That's all I'm noticing.  I can't.  All right, let's get some Kathy Buckley.  It could be the funniest shit ever.  And was Kathy Buckley the one run over?  She was.  She was the one that was run over.  You're not going to be able to move on from life until you find this guy here by a beach patrol.  We laughed for days, and I wasn't sure if it was the comic or someone else that was deaf.  Being deaf.  Huh?  Go back.  To her being deaf.  And there's a bit called being deaf.  When they talk about their handicapped. 
[02:24:30]  And Caroline.  It's the best.  It's the best part.  Oh, that awful deaf lady's haircut.  Yes, it's true.  I am hearing impaired.  No, I am not deaf.  Pause.  Pause.  I can't.  And she's got goofy eyes on top of it.  She looks all goofy.  She's got goofy eyes.  And comfort.  This is, listen.  If she just got a smashing every day from comics, she would be funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But she's, you see her comfortable.  She's strutting.  She's strutting around on the stage. 
[02:25:00]  But that's why, by the way, all those alternative fan comics, why not?  They want to not ever be mocked, ever.  Yeah.  They want to form their own clique and mock up.  And like, if you can't take a hit, how can you ever be funny like that?  Yeah.  You have to get that.  And when you're deaf, you think you'd be the ultimate funniest from just that voice  she has?  Yeah.  You'd be hilarious.  Man, you're my memory, my band.  And that bad fucking mullet she's got.  Stump mullet in that teacher's uniform.  And nobody trashes her.  How is no entrancing her?  Nobody says, will you get the fuck up?  Get it.  She's opening her eyes twice as wide to make up for the loss of hearing. 
[02:25:30]  She's trying to increase the sense of sight.  When she gets thrown at the ashes.  She's trying to see sound.  She's opening her eyes wide to open up her ear cam.  She's going to put a card down and ask for money after the fucking act.  We used to trash this stuttering comic in Boston so bad.  I can't remember how to say his name.  But we used to tease him unmercifully.  He's hilarious.  And he came and dressed really nice one day to Knicks.  And we was like, what the fuck are you doing, man?  Why are you all dressed nice? 
[02:26:00]  He's like, what was you selling vacuums?  Right?  And then motherfucker goes, no, motherfucker.  I don't want no vacuum.  You have to torture.  It's brutal.  It's pressure.  It's trial by fire.  It's destruction.  And whoever comes out is the winner.  You just come out.  That is great.  Can we go back to this clip?  I have a feeling this clip's going to take a long time.  It started with goofy eyes, man. 
[02:26:30]  We're rewinding it.  Look how comfortably she just kind of flows in.  Because she knows no one's going to throw something at her fucking head.  And she looks like a dude.  She really has a dikey look to her, doesn't she?  She looks like a guy that went through a sex change a little too late in life.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I was just...  Okay.  I was just...  Okay.  Is it one of these?  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  But she couldn't hear that, so that doesn't matter.  Okay. 
[02:27:00]  Four-wheeler hitting her on the beach.  Word coming in that...  Do you know a comic, a comedian named Nikki Payne?  She's a comic with a cleft palate.  No.  So after...  After this?  After the deafie.  After the deafie, we've got to go to the cleft palate comic.  We'll take other suggestions on our Twitter right now.  You know what?  And how different do you think it's going to sound than the deaf comic?  N-I-K-K-I.  That's a very similar handicap speech-wise.  All right, let's go with the...  P-A-Y-N-E.  Here we go.  Talking about her deafness. 
[02:27:30]  Yes, it's true.  I am hearing impaired.  No, I am not deaf.  I just don't listen.  Oh.  I just bought me one of those clappers.  You know, when you clap your hands and your appliances go on and off?  There's nothing more depressing than knowing that your appliances can hear better than you.  She sucks dick, man.  I'm not going to stand for that shit.  I know.  Go to Nicky Payne.  No, no, no.  It's so bad. 
[02:28:00]  We got it.  This is such nasty.  We got to keep going.  We got to keep going.  And it's mixed with 80s horse shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's 80s all the way through and through.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  What are you going to do?  I'm falling and I can't get up joke?  Come on.  We can't do a minute?  I'm dead.  We're 15 seconds in.  We're 15 seconds in.  Oh, believe me.  Let's give her a chance.  I'm trying to have fame call.  Do you understand?  Do you understand?  I'm waiting for fame to give me a call.  You niggas is making me listen to this bitch.  It's a minute.  Why don't you have Jelly Jewel Marathon, too, you motherfuckers? 
[02:28:30]  We're 23 seconds in.  Oh, my God.  It's a little over a minute.  Let's go.  Let's try to get to the end.  Well, now it's negative, and then a couple years later, I developed spinal meningitis.  That's just through my family, quote, that I would be a slow learner and that I would  not grow to be any taller than 5'2".  And then I was in a school for retardation for two years before they found out it was just  a hearing loss, and they called me slow.  Oh, my God.  Look at the clap she's getting for that. 
[02:29:00]  So she can see them.  What the fuck?  Imagine you're waiting to go on now through this.  The comic is next on the list of this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're almost to the end.  This is so bad.  I'm just trying to get you to the end.  If any comic.  I'm trying to start it to fast forward.  If a comic came up and did this and didn't have a handicap.  I don't know if it's low blood.  I'm trying to have fame call me.  You niggas is playing this bitch.  You're shaking over me. 
[02:29:30]  What are you doing, man?  I'm trying to fucking make it.  Are you that pissed or you need orange juice?  I can't figure it out.  What is wrong with you motherfuckers?  This is infuriating.  We're almost there, though.  We're almost there.  She didn't deserve to be on that stage.  I do wear two hearing aids.  One in each ear.  I'd wear a third one if I knew I'd put the darn thing.  This is my brand new hearing aid.  Get a load of this.  It's computerized now.  I have the hearing aid in my ears.  And this is my remote control.  A remote control?  I am now in control of your laughter. 
[02:30:00]  This baby cost me $4,000.  $4,000.  And I'm thinking, for another $1,000, I could have had that boob job.  It's not like I'm going to hear through my chat.  Is that TV?  Yeah, this was TV.  It was Caroline's Comedy Hour.  When it was on A&A.  How did it take me so long to work that club, dude?  Yeah, yeah, see?  For years I couldn't get in there.  You should have just went...  Nigga, cut your ears off. 
[02:30:30]  Stab your eyeballs out.  You'll be fucking on in a minute.  Yeah, instead of like...  Yeah, hi, I'm a working comic.  I've been like, click, hello?  What?  Hello?  Have a hangmail.  If you had that, if you were the deaf comic, how would you approach it?  Or would you just not do stand-up?  Or would you...  How would you...  Just don't do stand-up.  You have to address it, right? 
[02:31:00]  It's so...  Because they have to address it.  They have to, because everyone's so uncomfortable.  Everyone's like, what the fuck is it?  Everybody up until 2000 did comedy because they thought they were funny.  Right.  So she did comedy to put a message out there.  Yeah.  That it's okay to be deaf.  Deaf people can do it, too.  It's a message that she doesn't...  It's like...  It's like if you did comedy as a deaf guy, you was a funny motherfucker.  You figured it out.  Yeah.  Because people tease the shit out of you. 
[02:31:30]  And you learn how to be fucking funny.  You're not funny unless somebody fucks with you.  Mm-hmm.  Can we get the other comic up?  I don't like the we're on equal footing.  Even though I'm deaf, I'm a comic, too.  We're on equal footing.  No, you're not.  We got Nick.  Which bit you want?  Terrible.  We need a short one, obviously.  Nicky Payne, right?  Does she talk about her?  What's her problem again?  She got a...  As they call it, a cleft palate.  But I like the old hair lip.  Yeah.  Do you know? 
[02:32:00]  And they mentioned H-A-R-E as a rabbit mouth.  Looks like a little rabbit mouth.  I always thought like a hair.  What?  The hair was growing out of there?  That's all you do.  And they left the scar like that to remove it?  You got one?  Yeah.  It's like, wow, that was a big hair.  A beauty in the beast lip.  Yes.  Is that it?  Well...  Yeah, this should work.  All right.  We don't want to spend five minutes with this shit.  Oh, come on.  Let's just laugh for 30 seconds and move on.  Here's for Nicky Payne, Nicky.  Oh, this is from Last Comic?  Oh, Last Comic.  She was on Last Comic.  So I have a list. 
[02:32:30]  We used to have to go to speech therapy for it.  So every day this speech therapist would take me out of class.  She's boss on helium.  ...words over and over.  I'm out, too.  I'm out.  Wow.  Suck my dick, man.  She probably barely has a list thing happening.  Cartoon voiceover work, dude.  She'd be all out.  Yeah, yeah.  She could do that.  I think she should just go right to Nickelodeon and say...  She doesn't speak that better.  She sounds like a murder face.  You're making it worse than it is.  You see that guy...  Put that nine-minute one on and see what she's talking about. 
[02:33:00]  Put that nine-minute one.  Go ahead.  Let me see this shit.  Put that nine-minute one.  This is where we're going tonight, folks.  She's going to tear the stitches out talking along.  Not exactly intellectual comedy.  Oh, I'm a f***ing humping.  All right.  She's got the crowd going.  Hey, miss.  This is CTV.  I thought I was going to be a whole lot of...  Oh, God. 
[02:33:30]  You know she must have taken some shit growing up, though, right?  I think she might be funny.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  I've been only up here two seconds, and I've said f*** about a million times.  I'd like to tell you that I have Tourette's Syndrome, but I don't.  I'm just f***ing dirty.  But that's an affliction I would love to have.  I would love to have Tourette's Syndrome, because if I did, I'd just march around town  all day long going, f*** you.  Nice job.  It's March! 
[02:34:00]  I'm sorry, it's been correct.  She's aware that she's a horror show.  I know she's not.  She's alright, this chick.  She knows she's a nightmare.  Last time I said it didn't, because she had to do that whole...  I have a speech about...  If I did last time, I had to go on and go, I'm overweight, and she's being overweight.  It's like, you know, it's like, you know...  Oh, I know.  So, I don't...  She's aware.  She's not trying to...  She's just a mess.  I'm really overweight, and I sweat a lot.  If I didn't, I would explode. 
[02:34:30]  My father beat me with a whiskey bottle, and I turned tragedy into comedy.  Did you?  How about the comedy part?  Who's that?  Yeah, who are you?  Louie Anderson.  That's fucking Louie Anderson when he's a...  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I thought it was a fat shit comic.  I thought it was Roseanne for me.  Well, that too.  It could be any of the above.  Tragedy.  But Louie was a beast, though, back in the days, man.  Oh, God.  He was a...  You didn't think he was unfunny until later. 
[02:35:00]  I've never...  It's a lot of family feud.  Yeah, I think I was never a fan of Louie Anderson.  No, I think the first couple of times I saw him, I think I was like, all right, this  is funny.  But he came out with Sam Kennison in them.  They all came out together.  Yeah, but then he started getting on this whole thing of how, getting into his life  and how he was beaten as a child.  And he's gay, right?  And he couldn't say it.  Yeah.  That's a huge thing.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Just a chunky gay man?  Yeah.  And then I think the Enquirer had some shit that he had got a bunch of boys over his hotel.  Paying the pool boy or something. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He was paying off some shit.  Yeah, something going on.  That was the end of it.  I like sucking a cock.  They want to watch.  Sucking.  We should acknowledge Sean Rouse.  He's hilarious.  And he's just a mess on stage with that arthritis of his.  He's got like three things.  Sean Rouse is fucking hilarious.  Yeah, he's a fight, dude.  And he's got the bad arthritis and he's supposed to not drink, but he fucking loves his drinking,  which makes it worse.  Never heard of him.  His fingers are all just like fucking in weird directions and stuff. 
[02:36:00]  You've never heard of Sean Rouse?  He opened for a telecom.  Find Sean.  Yeah.  Is this a short clip?  Yeah.  Sean Rouse is hilarious.  You ever wake up so hungover you can't even move?  You just lay in there dehydrated.  The TV's on fucking full blast.  You can't find the remote.  All the lights are on.  The curtains are open.  This is too...  There's food all over the fucking place.  This is too real.  You know you have a Gatorade in the fridge.  If you could just get to it, that would propel you to the shower and on to breakfast. 
[02:36:30]  But you just can't move.  You're laying there thinking, I guess I'm just going to have to listen to SportsCenter one more time.  He's authentically miserable, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Then once you have it memorized, you say, all right, fuck it.  I'm just going to jerk off now.  It's the most fun thing to do when you're alone anyways.  So you do. 
[02:37:00]  And as soon as you come, you realize that you've pulled the last drop of moisture you had in your body  out through your dick.  Your lips chapped.  Your face dries out.  Your wrists curl suck to your chest.  Somebody's going to have to make a decision on me.  Is he new up here?  No, he's from the south somewhere.  I never signed anything.  Then you're laying there, you're thinking, fuck.  Now I'm in a world of shit. 
[02:37:30]  There's no way I'm moving now.  Unless I could eat that wad laying on the floor.  If I could get to that wad, that would propel me into the kitchen and then onto the shower.  So you know what you're going to have to do?  You're going to have to jerk off one more time.  This time on your face and chest.  Eat that.  That will propel you to the initial wad. 
[02:38:00]  And then onto the Gatorade.  And I know it sounds disgusting, but that's how McCain got out of NOM.  He's got arthritis.  You can stick your claws in your ass.  I'm looking for laughs.  Fuck him.  That doesn't count.  No, he's a funny guy.  He's got a bunch of shit around, though.  He's funny, but arthritis just doesn't count.  It's like crippling.  His arms are like...  Is he like this on stage?  If you flip her up a little bit, that doesn't even... 
[02:38:30]  No, flip her up a little bit.  Oh, my God.  Because he's normal.  But he takes a medication.  He's got something else on him, too.  And mentally?  I don't know.  No, the doctors basically say if you don't drink, it won't be as bad.  He's got bad white people breathing, unfortunately.  Huh?  It's like southern bad white people.  Oh, that inbreeding?  I'm not putting him with Kathy Buckley.  No.  It's not just a super...  That's a hard one.  That's terrible audio there.  He's got a great joke on having sex with an underage girl. 
[02:39:00]  Talking to the judge, which is just phenomenal.  He sounds funny.  He sounds funny.  And he's authentically miserable.  He looks like he's really...  Some guys are trying to pretend.  He was part of Jim Norton's thing there.  That's what he was saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he said it.  I'm sorry.  But arthritis doesn't...  You're debilitated.  But I got a pinched nerve in my neck that really fucking makes my arms hurt.  So I'm not fucking going for it.  Like, he's not going to get up on stage and you're going to be...  And I'm fucking diabetic.  I have diabetes.  So it's like, no, you don't get...  We feel like all like this, it doesn't... 
[02:39:30]  Nah, nah.  It's not going to distract you from the guy.  Did you ever see that commercial, the old lady who's got arthritis, and she's like,  I'm here to talk.  And she's got these rubbery little hands.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I'm here to tell you.  Knuckles are gone.  She's like, she's got Tyrannosaurus arms.  She's got Tyrannosaurus arms.  Nah, man.  I'm talking about...  Her fingers are like little T-squares.  Yeah.  They're little rubbery fingers.  They're little boomerang fingers.  All right, here's any nervous system conditions.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the only thing I'm talking about.  Nervous system conditions are bad. 
[02:40:00]  And on girls, too, I wanted to have sex with girls more, because they have, like, what  do you mean, like, I don't know what you call it, like swivel hips, you know what I'm  talking about?  Like elbow crutches, and like your hip kind of wiggles.  Oh, like that weird kind of, where the braces, those not full crutches, the metal braces.  I wanted to bag somebody extra because of that.  I have just felt that.  Really?  Just like this sexual...  And what stopped you?  You didn't go up to her and say hi?  Yeah, she would just...  No, I didn't.  She'd be into it.  Would she be cool with that?  Your self-esteem was low?  Fucking asshole. 
[02:40:30]  I got that one hip...  I remember girls in school, like...  I don't want to cheat on my girlfriend with a handicap, she doesn't tell it right.  And then she snitches on you on Twitter?  Honey, she had swivel hip, it's not cheating.  Like when I was going to, when I was going to, like, elementary school and shit like that,  it was fucking years ago, so you would get, like, the tail end of the thalidomide babies  that you get.  Oh!  So they were, like, the ones with the weird displaced hips and fucking big water heads  and shit.  I remember teachers from the end of the polio, you know, like the last guys that didn't get  polio vaccine back in the day, years ago, when I was a kid. 
[02:41:00]  The big shoe motherfuckers?  Yeah, big shoe people.  Yeah, big shoe people.  You big shoe motherfucker!  I did it.  You know how lucky you are not to be alive back when you just did big shoe disease for  the reason?  Big shoe disease.  Jesus, forrest Gump feet.  They didn't have a fucking shot for that.  And they had to explain to us, like, well, he had polio and they didn't have a cure for  it when you were, when he was in kindergarten.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking, it was one of those diseases they hadn't cured yet.  Oh, fuck.  Baby foot.  Older weeks.  Dude, how do people, by the way, ever take, like, a religion side over a science thing? 
[02:41:30]  It was just, like, all this shit you get from science and then nothing you get.  From religion.  Big foot disease, who, that's gone because it's science shit.  Right.  And, like, not one, I can't think of one religious thing that has helped anything.  Not one prayer has made big foot disease go away.  No.  It was a shot that was invented by people that, yeah.  Yeah, church just gives you this fucking hope.  This false hope.  Look at that science.  Science!  There weren't dinosaurs.  It was millions of years ago, not 5,000 years ago.  I'm trying to hold my hair in. 
[02:42:00]  I got a nice head of science hair.  Science hair.  Yeah, that's it.  I prayed to God all I wanted.  I had to go for Tinker for $12,000.  Yeah, dude.  Free a Propecia and Rogaine.  I take both of them.  Does it work?  Yeah.  Damn.  Really?  My hair, I would go both.  It doesn't work.  It's not exciting, though.  Dude, I would lose my hair unevenly, dude, up one side of my head.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Just horrific.  A big part.  Yeah, a big part.  Did it grow back?  Yeah, it grew hair back.  There's all the peninsula that's up to you. 
[02:42:30]  A peninsula.  I'm smiling, too.  And I'm desperate to hold on to it.  I don't even care.  It looks flammable.  Yeah, you just hold on.  I told you when I met him that my hair looks like burnt matches.  I said, somebody's trying to cover up a fart.  And Patrice goes, you were intimidated by me.  Yes, this is all examples.  It was all fucking great.  I have to tell people if I don't fucking play around with you, I don't like you.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what they have to all learn.  That's what they learn. 
[02:43:00]  That's all good.  Kurt Metzger's going to be at Helium Comic Club down there in Philly.  Nice.  Wednesday and Thursday night?  Yeah, I'm filling in for Dove Davidoff, I guess.  All right.  That's great, man.  People get a chance to see Kurt Metzger in the Philly area.  Helium Comic Club Wednesday and Thursday.  Anything else you're promoting there, Kurt?  Ugly Americans on Comedy Central.  Oh, they picked that up?  Yeah, the next one comes out in June.  He's like one of the stars of that.  Yeah, he is.  It's an animation.  All right.  Ugly Americans on Comedy Central.  And we're taking a break. 
[02:43:30]  And Patrice, you got your DVD out today.  Yes.  Elephant in the Room.  So hopefully the people picked that up.  Because there's extra material from...  Yeah, I hope that wasn't shown on Saturday night.  I think I missed Call from Fame.  That's a good special, man.  You can see that cut a lot of stuff, too, because I just see these weird...  The edits.  The weird edits.  I always hate that.  Yeah, what was he saying?  I don't like the commercial edits like that.  Yours wasn't as bad.  But you see some of these edits like, holy shit, what the fuck they cut out there?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, my presentation or whatever's wrong with it was like, my fault.  Like, they edited it out.  All right.  It was their phone there. 
[02:44:00]  It's all my fault.  I sucked.  All right.  On Friday, March 4th, the Opie and Anthony Show invites you to witness history as we present  Car Crash Comedy.

[02:44:30]  The virus, SiriusXM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Probably not the day to bring this up, but we got Kurt Metzger in studio, Helium Comedy Club  Wednesday and Thursday, trying to turn Anthony on to the wild and wonderful whites of West  Virginia documentary I saw a couple days ago.  I tweeted it to a bunch of people, and a lot of people really are digging this thing.  Kurt saw it.  Ant's got to see it. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, I got to see that.  Patrice has to see it.  Danny's going to see it.  It's a Johnny Knoxville project, man.  He followed this family around for a year in West Virginia, the whites, and they're all  extremely fucked up.  Extremely fucked up.  Yeah.  I already knew that.  I did that documentary already.  Somebody said they were going to buy it.  They threw it in the garbage.  I've never seen it again.  I tried to make six documentaries about how fucked up white people are.  No one wanted a bite.  Do we have a taste of this with some audio, maybe? 
[02:45:30]  A little fucking sizzle reel?  A trailer?  A little trailer or something.  You liked it, right, Kurt?  Yeah, I like it a lot.  And it's all based on a guy that he tap danced well or something.  Their dad invented a kind of new clogging or something.  Clogging?  Yeah, and then he was clogging.  And then he was...  West Virginia's, dude.  Oh, okay.  And then he was murdered just when he was going to hit, I guess, and become a big star.  Where?  I don't know.  Or something awesome.  And then his kid was the dancing outlaw, and there's a documentary about him, and they 
[02:46:00]  made another one 20 years later about the rest of the family.  Well, let's see what the trailer's about.  I'm telling you, if you haven't seen this yet, do so immediately.  Dan's going to see it, and then we'll have a whole discussion on it, hopefully later  this week.  Boone County, that's right.  What a coincidence.  I mean, ironic.  Boone County and West Virginia.  I really, really want to comment on that.  When you represent whites, you don't know what you're going to get into.  Shootings, armed robbery, embezzlement, forgery, drug cases, burglary fights, things like that. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, God.  I've been joy-killing people.  Cutting them up, shooting them.  I can't stop killing them.  That's how for some of the f***ing truck to turn me in a f***ing dead mineshaft, my pedagraphics  back.  I've got three mineshafts of his own.  Anyway.  Well, I used to be water in the back. 
[02:47:00]  I used to try a little coke here, and I smoked a little crack.  Holy shit.  Jake the Snake Robertson?  Yes, he does.  Oh, yes, he does.  Now, they're going to smoke their pills.  I'm like, if you started some f***ing weird thing, it would be time like I'd fight you.  The pills here is Kirk.  Kirk White. 
[02:47:30]  I just went on a rampage, pretty much.  The one's in prison.  What are you going to do, shoot me?  It's just strange how everything had happened in our family.  It's not at all strange, by the way.  He clearly caused all the problems.  It would have slain like a story.  Take your funeral. 
[02:48:00]  What do you want people to do?  F***ing roll, baby.  Trailer's not good for radio, obviously.  You know, I'm watching this, enjoying it.  I don't care.  Follow along at home, I guess.  This is a f***ed up family.  Go home and watch it today.  Oh, absolutely.  I'm telling you.  And then the music by Hank Williams III. 
[02:48:30]  Well, I guess he's an outlaw in his family.  They don't really dig Hank Williams III.  They don't?  I don't think.  That's what people were telling me on Twitter, I guess.  No, he's not.  I was learning a little more about the players in this movie.  Like Hank Williams Jr.  One of the broads gave birth, and then she's doing lines of something in the hospital.  Some say crystal meth.  I thought it was Coke.  It might have been Coke.  And they took her child away, and she didn't understand.  The one woman goes, well, they took him away because they probably found drugs in him.  And the baby's like a day old. 
[02:49:00]  And it's like just normal.  Like, well, they probably found drugs in him.  Yeah, it's great.  Like it's just normal thinking.  Or she was hiding drugs in the baby?  Yeah, she was hiding drugs in him.  Mueling drugs.  Then you had one guy in the family.  He went on a rampage, and he fucking was shooting at cops and his own uncle.  Who shot the guy that died?  No, no.  That didn't die.  That didn't die.  Who was the guy being buried?  You want me to give the whole movie away?  Well, it's not like a fucking mystery movie.  Why don't people get that? 
[02:49:30]  I'm a spoiler motherfucker, man.  Tell me the whole shit.  Every time you get the people out there, they get pissed.  Yeah, but it's not like it's a documentary.  It's just a grammar.  It's not like a...  It's not surprising.  It was just the matriarch.  It stayed that way the whole movie.  It was just the matriarch.  She finally died at 80-something.  Oh, I thought it was...  That's all it was.  They fooled me.  Yeah, they fooled you a little bit.  They tried to make it look like it was the guy.  Yeah, no.  That was just the matriarch finally passing on.  But you said the guy that invented the clog dance got murdered?  Yeah, but we didn't...  It was years ago.  Yeah, it was years ago.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I was confused. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  You can't even keep up.  There's been so much crazy shit happening.  Here's what we're learning right now.  Anthony's not watching it.  No, I think he's going to watch this one.  No, I watch dumb white people, too.  I enjoy watching dumb black people on the web and TV shows and shit, like First 48 and stuff.  If you...  Here's my thing with First 48, and I don't want to let a bunch of people in on this because  I know, you know, the cops probably don't want me to say this.  Oh, boy.  But if you watch a television show and the cops, the detectives walk in and they're talking 
[02:50:30]  to the suspect, and the suspect is telling him shit, and then finally either confesses  or gives up a friend or something like that, and the cop walks out of the room, and he's  like, they're high-fiving.  You see it.  They're like, yeah, yeah, we got it.  We got the case.  And when they walk in, and the suspect goes, I want to talk to my lawyer.  And they go, okay, that's within your right.  I'm not going to say another word.  They pick their stuff up, shut the door, and you see them go like, shit, fuck, they're 
[02:51:00]  mad?  Like, wouldn't you lawyer up immediately knowing that it pisses the cops off because then it's  probably in your best interest to lawyer up?  Who's the dummy that fucking talks?  A lot of people, dude.  You get the guy, the black guys are like this.  They pull their shirt up over their mouth.  Right.  They sit there, and they're just like, well, I don't know.  I saw Cheeseburger about 3.30.  He was with murder.  And I ain't seen nothing after that. 
[02:51:30]  And then they're just telling, like, every fucking detail.  People just want to be heard.  Do you remember who's the Central Park rapist, the kids that they put up?  Because I remember when I was a kid, the wilding sprees that these black kids were going on,  supposedly.  The wilding.  And it turned out, those kids didn't do any of it.  And they were like, we were railroaded.  I remember like, oh, they were railroaded, sure.  And it turned out, absolutely, some Puerto Rican guy did it, and they got blamed for it.  But I usually just say, they were probably guilty of something.  But how do you admit to it if you know you didn't rape somebody and beat their head in the rock? 
[02:52:00]  Jason's just shaking his head at me.  And we did good today.  But now it's on.  Now it's on.  No, it's, it's, I'm ignorant.  You were well-behaved today, Ant.  You were well-behaved.  I consider myself ignorant.  You were well-behaved until 9.30.  And now you got the cheek shaking his head.  I'm a slave to the racist media and racist judicial system.  I think Ant felt like he had to do that because of what he just saw.  He saw Whitey acting really bad and said, you know what, fuck that.  Do you think that's what just happened?  Yeah, because you've been well-behaved today.  Holy shit.  That might have been what happened? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Believe me, it was subconsciously, though.  Because I want to see, I love dumb white people.  I don't think so.  I think, I think the problem is really, um, I'm just shaking my head because it's just  shaking it.  I don't give a fuck.  But that's the thing that black people, some, we can't ostracize any, any of us, even if  we're wrong.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, and white people, these people are not embarrassing the white folks.  No, you're right.  Because it's so out there and they're the whites and they're stupid and shit.  So I'm not like, oh, fuck, that's gonna, that's gonna go. 
[02:53:00]  But I'll tell you one thing, though.  Culturally, sometimes I get embarrassed when I see, like, real over-the-top dumb guineas  that are just, hey, what the fuck, and I go like, oh, God, that's embarrassing.  Yeah, yeah.  But even these, even these whites think they're better than blacks.  Think?  If a nigga came up in a suit, holding a suit, with another suit on his other arm, with a 
[02:53:30]  catalog full of suits, and his diploma from his six colleges, they'll still be like, well,  yeah.  He gets sickle cellomania, so he's a fucking, yeah.  You bring home one of them, and I swear I'm gonna shoot you.  Yeah, a nigga in a suit.  Yeah.  Don't you also, aren't you, with a suitcase full of money.  Don't you believe, too, that, that athlete thing about, like, the slave, you know, the  better athlete, Jimmy the Greek, they have a higher muscle on their thighs, which makes 
[02:54:00]  them a better athlete.  I had somebody tell me that, like, my roommate from Georgia, they have a fast twitch muscle  that you can't, fast twitch muscle.  It's not the crock of shit, it's not, it's absolutely not true.  First of all, black people are better athletes, so it has to be a reason.  There's gotta be some type of reason.  I'll tell you it.  A breeding reason.  You wanna hear the clip?  You wanna hear the clip?  It's Jimmy the Greek.  Let me hear Jimmy the Greek.  Yeah, let's hear this.  The black is a better athlete to begin with, because he's been bred to be that way, because 
[02:54:30]  of his high thighs and big thighs that goes up into his back, and they can jump higher.  Well, what's wrong with that?  And run faster because of their bigger thighs.  This goes back all the way to the Civil War, when during the slave trading, the big, the  owner, the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman, so that he could  have a big black kid.  Why did he say that was so bad?  The cameraman was just looking, going, I am filming the last thing you will ever see 
[02:55:00]  Jimmy the Greek do.  I never heard the whole thing like that before.  It's fantastic.  For the youngsters, man.  He's obsessed with the big thighs.  Oh, yeah.  He was huge in sports when he said that, man.  He was on the top of his fucking game.  Every sporting event, they would come out and go to him as the handicapper, like, so who  do you pick?  Jimmy the Greek?  We're going to have Jimmy the Greek's picks.  And he was basing it on big thighs.  And big thighs and your big black.  Did you see it, um, 30 for 30?  The Jimmy the Greek 30 for 30, uh, documentary?  No.  Fantastic.  Really?  Because he wasn't on top when he said that. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, really?  I always thought he was.  CBS wanted him gone.  Right.  And he, they wanted to fire him.  Oh, shit.  Because he was, they were losing ratings.  Oh, perfect opportunity.  And he wasn't getting along with, uh, the white girl on the show.  She wouldn't, they wouldn't tape, no one would tape the show.  He taped it, fake taped it.  He wasn't even there.  They would, they would go to him and he had did it like in some fucking studio down the  street or something.  And they was looking for a reason to get the fuck rid of him, but he was so powerful.  But when he said this, they went, yippee!  That was like, perfect six years. 
[02:56:00]  So he was, he was pretty powerful then.  Well, no, he was a.  Jimmy the Greek, your big black.  He was an icon, you know, it was a hard to just get rid of him.  They breed your big black.  Well, Howard Cosell said some, some crazy shit too, as we all know.  Yeah, but that wasn't even.  And Hulk Hogan said some racist shit.  Yeah.  When he used to do promos against like Tony Atlas.  Shine my shoes, boy!  Like he went.  You better shine.  You never heard of Tony Atlas, racist Tony Atlas?  I don't think so.  Can you find racist Hulk Hogan, Tony Atlas?  What I love is the, with Dog the Bounty Hunter, after he said that thing, when he made up 
[02:56:30]  for it, he's going to be buried in a slave grave.  Yeah, yeah.  He's giving up going to white heaven now.  That was so embarrassing.  So uncomfortable to hear when he said that shit.  And that's all racism is now, is catching someone doing something racial.  Yes.  So, so white people effectively are doing a good job.  Policing, policing themselves.  No, no, at eliminating racism, because it's boiling down to racism is just the word nigger, 
[02:57:00]  some lynchings, and some other things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So once you get rid of that, it, it no longer exists.  Then it doesn't exist.  So now, there's a bunch of outlaws that they're catching that they, you know, and they do that,  it's, it's gone.  Stragglers.  Fucking gone.  We got a few stragglers.  Look at young Vince.  Iraq is a little confused.  It's Tony Atlas.  Yeah.  Well, we got, you got to fast forward to Hulk Hogan.  Yeah, let me see.  Yeah, this is a horrible version of the clip, unfortunately.  You seen it before?  Look at young Vince.  Jesus is a young Vince. 
[02:57:30]  Oh my God, look at his big thighs.  Okay, here comes the Hulkster.  Hold on one minute.  Hold on right here.  Enough of all the Gaga.  Let me tell you something.  If you want to see a body, if you want to see the real Mr. Universe, if you want to  see number one, I'm standing right here, and I came out here to show all my fans, enough  of this brown clown here.  Brown clown.  Brown clown.  Oh, this is the physique. 
[02:58:00]  It sounds like Lenny from Motorhome.  I'll tell you something, Tony Atlas.  Anything, anything that you can do, I can do better.  I'll tell you what, boy.  Anytime you want to pose down, anytime you want to get on the stage with me or turn that  ring, boy, I'm ready for you because all you can do is shine my shoes.  You want to get on the stage with me or turn that ring, boy.  You understand?  She raised a 6'2", 250 pound man. 
[02:58:30]  Something whoops your back, boy.  You understand?  Anytime you want to get on the stage with me, you want to get on the stage with me.  You want to get on the stage with me.  The only answer back where the Scatman Brothers was.  Let me tell you.  Hong Kong phooey.  What is that just for wrestling purposes, that racism?  That guy screamed out.  Yeah, but it's still, you never see that even by mistake now.  You brown clown, shine my shoes, boy.  Shine my shoes, boy. 
[02:59:00]  It was acceptable.  Wasn't it a brown clown back then?  Wow, man.  You think that hurt Tony Atlas' soul?  You black and you whack.  You think that hurt Tony?  I'm bigger, nigga.  You think his family was like, go figure.  Why you got to do that?  Why you got to do that kind of shit?  Let that white man, it's like, mama, that's how I'm making money.  That's how I'm buying your car, mama.  Yeah.  And her mother don't care.  Her mother's like.  Nah.  Like my mother. 
[02:59:30]  Like Tony Montana's mother.  She ain't Tony Montana's mother.  If I gave my mother some dirty money, she'd just put it right in her fucking bra.  Hey, mama, your son is a success.  Your son is a success.  I robbed two banks, killed 14 people.  And she'd be like, be careful.  I just shut it right in her.  Oh, look at that.  Isn't your brother just the best thing in the world, you big frizzy-headed bitch?  Who'd you kill for this, Tony?  Oh, mama, come on, nobody.  I don't want your hand on it. 
[03:00:00]  My mother take every fucking shitty slave dime.  It's a business success.  If I was shuffling, zippity-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a.  Zip-bidi-doo-dah.  Zip-bidi-okay.  Playing a trumpet.  My old knight.  Put the fucking top on it.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  With a plunger in it.  Oh, yeah.  She ain't giving a shit.  I brought it for me.  Howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy.  Howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy. 
[03:00:30]  That country.  Give me that money, motherfuckers.  Any of those?  You need to move.  He brought her a fucking one-bedroom fucking house, and that was...  Patrice is sprinkling sand on the floor.  My mother and my girl hates my horse shit integrity.  What the fuck are you doing, nigga?  I need some new shoes.  Can we play the Booker T clip real fast?  Holy shit, man.  Where he fucked up and said the N-word.  It's one of my favorites.  Oh, shit.  And he gets so mad at himself. 
[03:01:00]  Like John Mayer did when he said his penis was racist.  You ever see this?  We take what we want, and after we take that frugger and the giant, we want the gold, sucker.  Hulk Hogan, we're coming for you, nigga.  I should want out the record, Stevie Ray.  Look at this.  And Sammy was like, oh, shit.  That look...  And that was before they established the A-E-R difference.  Yeah.  But with his hands, he knew. 
[03:01:30]  I'm going to have to redo that.  Still better than any older warrior ever since.  There's an even better one that was like the last edgy thing that WWE did before they  went in the other direction that they're probably trying to bury at this point.  Oh, yeah.  Which is just Vince McMahon's outward use of the N-word.  Oh, really?  Have we ever played this?  I don't remember this.  It was from a couple years ago.  It wasn't even that long ago.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  Let's hear this.  He's a little gray.  What's up, boss?  Yeah.  What's good in the hood? 
[03:02:00]  Just holding it down.  Trying to take care of business.  Keep it up.  I'm a nigga.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  It was good acting.  Tell me.  He didn't just say that.  Well, it's kind of hypocritical, Booker.  I thought he said it a lot.  It was just...  Did you see how awkward he was even saying it? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  He was like, oh, boy.  Well, I'm going to have to say this word.  The electricity shit in his body.  That's just fucking...  That should be classically known.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah.  And then the strut afterwards?  Yeah, he did a strut.  He did it on pay-per-view, so it's okay.  It's all right.  Oh, it was a pay-per-view?  Yeah, so it's fine.  That's good.  Black people weren't watching that.  That's what I'm paying for.  Extra.  Yeah.  That's what he did.  Extra niggas.  You know.  Yeah.  Niggas.  Niggas pay for pay-per-view.  Oh, my God. 
[03:03:00]  Jimmy the Greek's pay-per-view.  Oh, man.  Jimmy the Greek's pay-per-view.  Does he have a pay-per-view?  That's fucking horrid.  He looked very awkward and uncomfortable saying that.  He probably knew it was not a good idea to be doing this.  Oh, you think so?  Yeah.  Probably, like, immediately after he did it, he was like, what?  It didn't do any good to do that.  Yeah.  It didn't help.  But when Triple H was here, man, I was skating.  Yeah.  Well, I'm telling you, when I was saying that, Vince is the boss. 
[03:03:30]  When he said, oh, he pitched me an idea, I'm like, Vince, he don't pitch ideas.  He tells you.  Like, Booker T probably was like, I don't really want to do that.  Yeah.  He's going to do it.  Yeah.  He'll do it.  It's not like Booker T had a choice to be offended.  He put Booker T in a spot.  Yeah.  Because he don't give a fuck, man.  He's the boss.  That's his fucking show.  And it's his world show.  Yeah.  Somebody has to tell him that, you know, hey, Vince, I don't know if... 
[03:04:00]  Really?  Because that's why he had to stop the nation, the domination and all that.  Yeah.  He ran it by his black Republican friends.  They said he was cool.  That's fine.  I heard Thomas said it was fine.  Fine.  Fine, Vince.  No problems.  My nigga.  I know.  He really didn't.  It didn't come out very natural.  And you just go, Vince.  That's a good clip, though, because of the strut.  You can't do that, man.  You can't do that.  Vince.  You've been strutting afterwards.  But there was no trouble.  I didn't hear nothing about it.  This is not random to me.  No, man.  That's the first time I heard that.  That must have been right before it really became... 
[03:04:30]  But it was halfway hilarious, though.  It was like kind of...  Yeah, yeah.  They set him up as like the guy...  I mean, it's not...  Yeah.  ...offensive.  No.  What year was that?  It must have been...  It must have been...  No, it wasn't that recent.  It was probably 2006.  Oh, okay.  That's recent enough.  Well, that's recently enough for people to get pissed.  It has to be right around the Imus thing when we all started talking about it.  Wow.  It couldn't have been after.  No.  No, it wasn't.  Yeah, it was 2006.  He'd have been crucified.  Because it was a couple years before Imus. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, you think it happened before the Imus.  It had to have happened before Imus.  If it happened after, he would have gone.  But Booker T had to be there to make it less brutal.  Right, right.  Right.  He's standing there naked with his...  He's already naked.  Standing there like a naked big buck with high thighs up into his back muscles.  Looked like a Zulu warrior.  But do you see that John Cena was well-dressed for the championship?  And they just get this naked...  Ass sweaty.  Ass sweaty.  Fucking goddamn dreadlocks.  He looks like a Mark for Death... 
[03:05:30]  The Mark for Death fucking boss.  Just fucking nude.  All right, Patricia might be right about some things.  Oh, man.  Cena looking all nice.  Just showered.  Cena was pressed.  Right.  He had his fucking...  My nigga.  And he goes by a guy that looks like my nigga.  Would he...  Would he say that to him because he's yours?  With his fucking...  With his girlfriend that has a prom dress on and a tiara and just a naked sweaty man.  He might as well had a bone through his nose. 
[03:06:00]  Just going booger booger.  Right.  Eating it with a pot.  With a white man's hand.  Everything is okay.  The white people.  You just don't...  I know.  One day, though...  I probably won't live to see it, but it'll be a nice...  White people get some kind of awakening.  You think?  That just fucks with them.  Because I think one day everybody's going to leave this country.  I think all their half-black grandkids will be the...  Say that again?  All the half-black grandkids. 
[03:06:30]  I just wanted to hear you say it again if you had the balls.  What did I say?  Shut up.  Okay, so...  Don't even try to dig yourself out.  We've caught your timing off.  You know we did.  Don't fucking...  Don't fuck...  We're professionals.  Just take it in the face.  So...  Something's going to fucking happen.  Just something's going to happen when white people are going to just be faced with their 
[03:07:00]  own horror.  Somehow.  Somehow.  We'll find a way to kill all blacks, finally.  We'll figure an inventive way out of it.  They'll put something...  Something in the jelly.  You know?  Those 70s movies where...  Something will happen.  They've got the poison that just kills blacks.  Something will happen.  Yeah, you think?  April 2007 on that clip.  When did the IMAS go down?  Never.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Danny's doing the...  I'm figuring it out right now.  Huh.  What kind of thing do you think could happen to white people?  Dude, he did it.  I'm telling you.  Thank you.  He did it right around the IMAS shit. 
[03:07:30]  IMAS was...  IMAS was April and this was April.  And, uh...  But he would have never did that to...  This is a direct result to the IMAS thing.  I'm telling you.  To what?  Try to get attention?  Wow.  It was two weeks later.  Vince knows.  It was two weeks after the IMAS.  Thank you.  So he was trying to get some attention.  Wow.  What the hell did he think?  Because he said it with the GGA.  Yeah, but that didn't matter at that point.  It didn't matter.  You're right.  But he...  Because IMAS didn't say Nigger, though.  He said Nappy had it home.  Nappy had it home.  Right, but then it brought the whole N-word discussion.  N-word. 
[03:08:00]  Or a fiasco.  That N-word fiasco.  You motherfuckers really did effectively...  We did fuck it up.  ...find a way to say Nigger.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone has to say it.  I can't even...  I refuse to stop saying Nigger.  They used to just say...  And they were using racial epithets.  Oh, my God.  And that could cover a lot of ground.  When have you ever heard the word Nigger used to describe anything in the news?  Now you hear N-word, which is supposed to take the place of Nigger...  All the time.  ...all the time, but you never heard of Nigger.  Yeah.  It's...  White people are very, very good. 
[03:08:30]  Crafty.  Very crafty.  Very good.  Do you remember above the Laugh Factory here, the big banner that said...  The band, the N-word project?  Oh, God.  ...started a project?  Because of fucking Michael Richards?  Yeah.  But we fell for it.  Black people fell for it.  I didn't fall for the banana in the tailpipe, but a lot of...  A lot of black people fell for that whole, like, yes, bury it, the NAACP.  And I'm like, this is...  I want to keep it.  Fuck that.  Did they have a funeral like that?  Yeah, yeah.  The funeral.  A fake funeral.  And they were burying...  Is it Detroit?  The word arose like, Jesus.  Yeah, the word came back... 
[03:09:00]  Three days later.  And black people came back stronger and fucking...  Black people should be...  Performing miracles.  Black people should be marching like Egyptians to stop fucking...  Like, to stop this slave thing that they're doing.  Anything that has nigger in it, ever, is going to be replaced by fucking...  Slave!  Yeah.  In person.  What is it, Tom?  Oh, right, you know.  Yeah, yeah, Tom Sawyer.  That's just...  You know, as a kid, I had that book, like, the illustrated classics, and it just didn't  have that in it, and it didn't, like, take anything out of the book.  Oh, really? 
[03:09:30]  Like, I didn't...  I know the gist of the story, and you didn't have to put nigger gym in, it was fine.  Yeah.  You can't be...  It just said gym in the book I had.  It just said gym?  You gotta leave it alone.  Yeah, and they're children's illustrating...  That seems wrong, right?  Yes, it's wrong.  But this country hates history.  It's a shiftless, lazy gym.  Where was the fight about that going on?  Like, in the South or up here?  It's not even a fight, because black people were just as outraged as white people that  that word was being removed.  No, no, they're removed.  Condescending.  It was the dumb publisher, because they wanted to get the book in school. 
[03:10:00]  Let me tell you what's gone now.  Ready?  What's gone now?  Mm-hmm.  Sticks and stones will break my bones.  Yeah, man.  Oh, shit.  But names will never hurt me.  It's a destroyed...  Because all these...  Now names hurt...  Kids kill ourselves.  Everybody hurt.  It's bullying.  What the fuck?  Bullying.  We don't need the bullying...  Let's have an anti-bullying seminar, and...  You know...  And in the end, the sticks and stones didn't hurt you.  You know what I wish they told me in school, Silver Ed?  When I was in school, I wish they were like, listen, all these people around you...  Well, at least they didn't break your balls.  One of them matters, and they're not even worth the price of a bullet to gun them down. 
[03:10:30]  That's all you have to remember.  Don't get all worried about it.  Right.  Everyone around you does not matter, even a little bit.  So don't...  It's not even worth getting a gun and killing...  They're not even worth killing them with guns.  Right.  That's all they could have told me in school.  I would have been fine.  No.  People got bullied in school, though.  People got bullied.  It's what happened.  You really...  But there's still people in my past that I do wish...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It still sits in my craw. 
[03:11:00]  But doesn't that make you who you are?  I wish I could light your whole family on fire.  But do you think if you didn't have that with you, you'd be just so much more of a wonderful  person?  Or did it just make you who you are?  It prepares you for consequences.  Yeah, see?  Like, they're fucking up the natural progression of what makes people people.  Order.  They're trying to take out all this bad and just make it good and everything.  And life isn't like that.  What's the point of fighting to get to the top?  Like, if you feel... 
[03:11:30]  Like, I'm always teasing about it, but I'm just like, you know, being a celebrity or being  an athlete, you really are the natural A crowd.  You're naturally better.  Like, not even...  Fuck Hollywood.  Just when you were in high school, if you were the baddest, the toughest kid, the prettiest  girl, the funniest guy, the fastest athlete, the best basketball...  You were better than, say, these...  These, uh, emu...  Emu.  These emo girls.  Emu.  Or these fucking emu girls. 
[03:12:00]  I'd rather have the emu girl.  Oh, they're emu.  Or the people that work at the Apple Store.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The kids that work at the Apple Store.  The geeks.  They found a way for them to be part of the A crowd, but what they used to do is they were  natural, uh, spectators.  Yeah.  They were, you know, naturally spectators.  And now, there's no order.  They were the people in the back of the shot during the sitcom where you're showing the  real cast members.  Like, in Welcome Back, Cotter, you had them, and then you had the people in the back of the 
[03:12:30]  classroom.  You had the sweat hogs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then you just had...  Because the class had to kind of be filled up.  Sure.  So, you gotta put in the rest of the people.  They're just spectators.  Yeah, they're watching the action.  Shut up, Boom Boom.  Shut up, Barbarino.  And the rest would be back there like, Barbarino's crazy.  Freddie Boom Boom's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Horseshack is silly.  That's what they don't have no more.  No.  Now they go...  Now they tweet Boom Boom and go, you know, fuck you, nigga.  I'm better.  Or Barbarino, you don't dance that well, bitch.  I got my BG's out right now. 
[03:13:00]  You're going bald, motherfucker.  Yeah, like...  Like, you haven't earned a spot to say shit.  You haven't.  Everyone has a say now.  Does that cut down on the celebrity assassinations, though?  I don't know.  Like the stalking and...  Like a forum for these weirdos?  It does give them a forum, but is that better or worse?  I don't know what the stats are.  Before you could, like, blog or be on reality TV, didn't you have to, like, shoot John Lennon?  Yeah, definitely.  You had to, like, write them letters that they would get and be like, wow, this is creepy.  But now there's so many creepy tweets. 
[03:13:30]  Oh.  Sorry.  Oh.  I was just wondering what that was.  It was too loud, right?  What is it?  Good.  Sorry.  Damn.  It might have been another bit with the N-word.  That's all.  Sorry.  Sorry.  No, we were just talking about that.  I didn't realize you could hear it that well.  No, it's...  There was an order that's gone.  Yeah.  It's just like, I talk that shit, but I'm like, you know, on Twitter, dude, for you to  really think you're my friend on Twitter, it really is a...  It is. 
[03:14:00]  It's like, dude, I don't know you.  At all.  And it's like, if I'm talking to you through...  You gotta understand, man, that's not really what it is.  No.  It's because I'm, you know, I'm trying to be cool, a man of the people type of shit.  How you doing?  Da, da, da.  But for real, you know, Lady Gaga got it right.  Like, walking down the street, half naked, with a circle of bodyguards, and she goes,  ew, don't let them get close to me.  And then go perform in front of them. 
[03:14:30]  But she makes believe she's everyone's friend, right?  Right, but she's really not...  She's not that person.  Not really.  Yeah, man.  But it's like, just respect your natural order.  Like, if you're not a confident fucking A personality...  Like, look, there's some A personality people out there who don't get a chance to have  the public, you know, forum.  Yeah.  But if you don't have a non-A dude that you catch up to...  Because sometimes I'll answer a Twitter person, because Big Mom, a lot of people don't know,  but they'll put Patrice O'Neal.  So I'll search Patrice O'Neal sometime. 
[03:15:00]  Like, you know, some girl wrote, you know, he said the same shit in Houston that he said  on a special, boo.  So I had to write her back, boo, you lying, bitch.  And then I said, triple boo to you, nigglet.  Like, fuck you.  Like, you don't...  You haven't...  You're lying.  Yeah.  Why would you say that hateful ass shit?  Yeah.  Because they want to not...  Some people want to compliment you, but they feel like a pussy if they just...  You know what I mean?  They got to knock you down a peg. 
[03:15:30]  I know, I got the nerve to be honest.  But I think I earned talking.  Yeah.  I mean, I've been through some bullshit.  I've earned talking for over 20 years.  Some people don't just get to, like, just get to come in and talk.  Yeah, that shit.  That's the shit that just pisses you off.  If I see somebody that really says something nasty or whatever the fuck, and I feel like,  I'll block them.  Sometimes I just...  I look at how many followers they have. 
[03:16:00]  If they have, like, three followers, you're not going to bother giving them the time of  day to the public, so you private message them in Twitter and just lambast them, and then  send it, and then block.  Yeah.  Now you gave them a little tidbit, and you know they can't get back at you.  And then I do always say, like, oh, really?  With your three followers?  Do you think I'm honestly going to post this in the open public forum?  That's where Block Monday came from.  Block Monday.  You go in, you go... 
[03:16:30]  Yep.  You socialists...  And I don't mean socialists.  Socialists.  Yeah, socialists.  You nobody knowing motherfucking piece of shit said, fuck me, fat boy?  Yeah.  I'll fucking smack the shit out of you.  Fuck you.  What, are you serious?  Three people, and then those three suck, his three people suck, and they got a three...  You're gone.  And your fucking friends.  I do that.  If they have under ten people, I know that he's going to be like, hey, did you get this 
[03:17:00]  guy and tweet my response because he blocked me?  So I block all of their friends, too.  Well, I got to get on Twitter.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah, Twitter is fun.  Once they...  Once you have established your order of how you do shit.  There is.  You could be like one of these dictators and just chop heads off.  And the people who say fucked up shit, they know how to say fuck, because all I ask is  witty.  Yeah, witty.  You could be racial, you could be fucked up, but be witty. 
[03:17:30]  Just some wit to it, and you're fine.  So you're Gaddafi on your Twitter rant?  Then...  No, just sometimes...  Mowing him down?  No, you know what it is?  Sometimes I pardon you.  Sometimes I pardon you.  And you pardon the ones that you're not sure about, because they go...  Yeah, yeah.  You go, he probably gave it a shot.  I'm bashing.  Like, all right, I'll give it to him.  Why don't we have a pardon day?  Pardon day?  Amnesty for...  You got a chance to come back. 
[03:18:00]  No, because whenever people...  No pardon day?  Sometimes they get in touch with me through, like, I made this account just to ask you  to please unblock me because blah, blah, blah.  I didn't say anything bad.  And I'm like, I know if I blocked somebody, they fucked up.  They fucked up.  It's not...  I don't block people and then think...  Anthony, though, people hear this show and get confused about what meanness is, though.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  They're confused about how it is.  Oh, absolutely.  They hear you bash Voss, but they don't know what a line of... 
[03:18:30]  The line is right.  ...funny you're trying to be.  But it's just like you just go, hey...  Like, if somebody's...  Like, we talk about me burning bridges, but if somebody just goes...  You know, hey, fat boy, don't fuck this up.  Like, I'm sorry.  Yeah, wait, wait.  First of all...  Sorry, don't...  Who the fuck are you?  Don't...  Don't worry about whether I fuck.  Watch your fucking mouth.  Yeah.  You're not sitting next to me on the show and, you know, I didn't just rip you an asshole  and you're not Voss coming back at me with something.  So...  This ain't camaraderie, nigga.  Yeah, you just... 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You essentially wrote me a letter or made a phone call.  Yeah.  Dude, there's a lot of day job dudes that wanted to be a comic, but they have the balls to go  through the bullshit you have to go through.  And they feel like they always were a comic, even though they have a fucking roofing job  or something.  Yeah, yeah.  So they'll just talk to you.  We're both in the business.  I'm funny at my dumb lunch head job.  Yeah.  You know, I've been told...  Pretty funny.  And that's how I got started.  I got started as a funny...  Thinking I'm a funny guy and heckling a guy, a comic, who I thought I was funnier than. 
[03:19:30]  And then I was absolutely who I despise now.  Oh, shit.  Because I was coming from a place of jealousy.  It wasn't a place of like, hey, I'm just trying to help.  It was, I think I'm funnier and I'm going to fuck with this guy, his profession.  Because he's up there and I'm not.  But I didn't realize being a comic is a profession.  Being funny is another thing.  Being funny is, I know that all the people all the time that I'm being funny with, being  funny in another country is a whole nother thing. 
[03:20:00]  Or being funny, like Ricky Gervais was funny on the Golden Globes, when the whole audience  is staring at him and going, I want to, who can we call to ostracize this motherfucker?  It was hilarious.  It's like, that guy did some gangster shit.  It wasn't, put some douchebag who thinks he's funny in front of fucking Hollywood and stand  there and, and call Tom Cruise gay.  Yeah.  Awesome.  That's fucking great.  And talk about Scientology and, and, and, and not stop. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Like, even under the pressure of, it started getting uncomfortable and he just kept pressed  on like a soldier.  That was one of the greatest things I've ever seen, man.  Yeah.  He ramped up.  That's gangster.  That's fucking gangster.  You go.  Yeah.  I remember, uh, I guess when I saw him, that was my favorite thing was at the, the wedding.  What was that?  Oh, pilot.  I wrote on this pilot that he was on with Voss.  Like the wet, it was like the wedding class.  You know, I got that somewhere.  I don't know where, but.  Do you have it?  I wonder where it came out.  But there was a reality show where he, he followed the groom of the bride's family and 
[03:21:00]  Voss followed the wife's family for the wedding.  And then they roast the family at the toast.  It's like a roast.  Like a, so we would follow the family taken to write jokes.  So, but she's all these jokes too.  The family that was invited apparently had no idea a pilot was, or what the pilot was  going to be.  And they insisted on bringing the kids in and shit.  It was, by the way, a terrible idea for it to do at the wedding.  So Patrice went on.  We wrote like, just vicious, like what you write for like comic books for a family on  a wedding, some townie family, upper state, upstate New York. 
[03:21:30]  Dude, they hated Patrice.  And people, they loved him the whole week.  I mean, it was like seeing like the, the stress test of luggage where the gorilla is  smacking.  I feel like, I saw the depth, his depth test of like, when the, oh, racist matriarch,  mom, mom, mom.  I said, mom, mom, mom, mom.  I said, mom, mom really acts like she never blew, blew and fuck, fuck anybody.  And they was like, she had eight kids. 
[03:22:00]  So she had to fuck, fuck somebody, mom, mom, fuck, fuck.  Because you have to have something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue.  And three of those describe mom, mom's vagina.  It was a brutal, it was a brutal fucking, I mean, a brutal roof.  Dude, they were so mad.  It was hilarious.  I said, this girl got a cold song.  We were hiding behind a wall.  So the family, the family couldn't see the crew.  So they're, they're outraged.  So you hear Noah laughing.  And you hear me high-pitched cackling through the wall. 
[03:22:30]  Oh my God.  While there's family's angry.  I'd love to see that.  Oh, dude.  It was, it was, they probably couldn't do it.  It was just too much.  It was too much.  But I, we, I left so fast.  I threw, it was a rented tuxedo or something.  I threw that at the producers, got dressed in the bathroom and ran.  I got in the room.  They had to hold, you know how fucking, these Jersey Shore bitches, they want to be held  back from fighting me.  Right.  Because I made a cold soul remark about this bitch.  I said, listen, if you, if you run out of ice, just use one of the cold souls off of 
[03:23:00]  this other bitch's face or whatever.  It was just at a big, holy, just a family, imagine a family, family, townie wedding.  You assaulted them.  It was a roast.  Do you, you come from lumber people, right?  Like you imagine them with this Patrice yelling, and let your mom on, your Italian grandma  and I told the driver, I told the driver, let's go, let's go, let's go.  I threw the shoes out the window and then fucking, out of limo and fucking, you got this? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, man.  You got to bring this onto the show.  I think my buddy got that shit.  You got it, Kurt.  I never got to see it when I got done.  We got to play some clips from this.  I got to call my boy and see him.  You got it.  Bring it in, man.  I really was killed, but he was, they hated him so much.  Voss might have it.  Ask Voss if he has it.  Yeah, I think Voss is in a market.  Mark, you know, Mark Market probably has a copy they give you.  Well, awesome.  The producers.  Hey, Kurt, we got to work in more, man.  Kurt Metzger.  Definitely.  Did great today.  Oh, shoot.  Helium Comedy Club, Wednesday and Thursday, 8 o'clock. 
[03:24:00]  It's over?  Good comedy club in Philly.  It's over.  Well, I'll be back.  Went fast.  Jimmy's gone all week, so fucking come on in.  Jimmy's slacking this week.  What's he doing?  A little Hollywood action.  He's got some things.  He's got fame calling.  Norton is not waiting for fame to call.  Norton is knocking on doors.  Norton is chasing the fame.  Is fame here?  Is fame here? 
[03:24:30]  I'll try next door.  I'll try next door.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I wasn't bothering fame.  Norton, leave fame alone.  He's a nice guy.  Can I get a picture with you?  Picture with fame.  I want a picture with fame.  But he's doing it right.  He's going to go home now and wait for fame to call.  Wait for the phone call.  I'm just looking at my watch.  But the DVD is out today, Elephant in the Room.  DVD today.  Let's make sure we pick it up.  Yes.  45 minutes of something you didn't see.  And there's some deleted scenes.  There's a few people that didn't even see the special.  So you get the whole thing on DVD today. 
[03:25:00]  So hopefully it'll be some buzz.  I don't know.  That's great.  I think that's it for today.  Yeah.  I think we got the black tweet of the day in honor of Black History Month.  So we'll end with this here.  In honor of Black History Month, the opening Anthony show proudly takes a look at the most  inspiring and intellectually stimulating African-Americans on Twitter.  And today's tweet comes from, today's tweet comes from, oh, there you go.  Somebody that can read, T-Ducks 410.  I think them fruit snacks got me walling. 
[03:25:30]  LOL.  Ay.  Well said.  T-Ducks 410.  Stay tuned all month as I continue to celebrate the accomplishments of the African-American culture.  Here on the opening Anthony show.  T-Ducks 410.
