<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, playfully arguing before boasting about their improved Chicago and San Francisco ratings.  They then read a dismissive email from a listener, "Big Fan, USA," sarcastically suggesting they find work at Burger King.  Anthony recounted attending a Radio City Music Hall reading featuring Stephen King, John Irving, and J.K. Rowling, detailing King's humorous performance and the enthusiastic reaction to Rowling. This led to a discussion about the fine line between sanity and impulsive, absurd acts,  including hypothetical assaults on Bill Maher and J.K. Rowling.  Anthony described his prime seating, secured through an auction, and his proximity to the stage, mentioning fleeting thoughts of assaulting Whoopi Goldberg, the event's hostess.  Other celebrities present included Soledad O'Brien and an unnamed Black actor.  They also addressed media misrepresentation of their feud with Whoopi Goldberg.  A substantial portion of the show focused on the "Whip Them Out Wednesday" ("WOW") campaign, encouraging listeners to display "WOW" stickers on their cars to attract women who would flash them, discussing the campaign's success and associated rules.  Audio clips from Russ Meyer's "Mondo Topless" were played, featuring topless women in San Francisco and Meyer's distinctive narration, sparking further discussion.  The segment concluded with a call from a heavily intoxicated Doug Stanhope, who described his self-invented cocktail, the "Xanadu," a concoction of Xanax and mushrooms.

Doug Stanhope joined the show as a guest, launching into a discussion about his psychedelic drug experiences, particularly with mescaline and mushrooms, and how these experiences intertwined with his thoughts on mortality and his difficult relationship with his dying mother. He detailed a mescaline trip where he witnessed mountains melting in the desert.  The hosts shared their own drug experiences.  Stanhope discussed his life in Arizona, his disdain for Dane Cook, and problems with his website.  The show then featured "Mousetrap Trivia," a $1000 prize contest.  Contestants included a Princeton PhD student with stretched earlobes, a mosquito control worker who'd had West Nile Virus, a steel mill worker, and a stereotypical O&A fan.  Bob Kelly was mentioned as being in studio.  The segment included promotion for upcoming Opie and Anthony live shows, ticket sales, and a PSA for LSD, featuring a woman convinced her hot dog was speaking to her.  Mark Parenteau's imprisonment for providing PlayStations and inviting underage boys to his home was also discussed.


The mousetrap trivia continued, with contestants Andy, Keith, and Jason answering increasingly difficult (and poorly written) music and pop culture questions.  The use of electric and glue mousetraps as punishment for wrong answers led to comedic moments and discomfort, possibly due to one contestant’s pre-existing medical condition. Bob Kelly participated in the mousetrap punishments. Andy eventually won the $1000. This was followed by an "XM walkover" street segment, filled with crude and offensive interviews about the heat.  The show also promoted their upcoming appearance on David Letterman and included a listener call criticizing their behavior, which was met with further insults.  The segment ended with a "Daily Dump Report," summarizing the show’s offensive and crude comments.


A significant portion of the show focused on a confrontation with Howard Stern, with Opie and Anthony announcing their August 31st appearance on the David Letterman Show and challenging Stern to prevent it, framing it as a "World Series of Assholes." They confidently asserted Stern couldn't stop their appearance. Richard Huff of the New York Daily News was interviewed live, receiving intentionally outrageous quotes from Jim Norton ("I like eating bananas because they remind me of dicks" and "Aussie rules") for his article.  Huff also relayed Stern's claim that he *could* have stopped their appearance but chose not to, suggesting pressure from someone at CBS led to their booking. The segment was rife with vulgar and offensive jokes, targeting various groups. A listener’s criticism of their focus on Stern was met with insults.  A call from Mark Burnett, producer of Rockstar: Supernova, connected the show to Tommy Lee, who shared a story about a woman with inflatable breast implants and armpit valves. The broadcast continued with further vulgar exchanges and a discussion of a satirized Mel Gibson 12-step program in the Daily News, followed by a recounting of an uncomfortable elevator ride with Jim Norton.


The show then transitioned to a discussion of music preferences (Led Zeppelin vs. Black Sabbath), followed by a promotion for a "Mistress Rhiannon" website.  An interview with Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe ensued, covering the band, the upcoming "The Dirt" movie adaptation, and graphic sexual details from the book, including the "burritos" story. The conversation extensively involved vulgar discussions of penis size, comparing it to various objects and celebrities.  A past argument where Opie called Tommy Lee a "pussy" was rehashed, leading Tommy Lee to hang up as threatened.  Further discussions included underwear preferences and a caller's story about seeing Bruce Springsteen's penis. A caller's description of a woman's breasts led to a promotion of the Opie and Anthony "WOW line." The segment concluded with more promotion of their upcoming events and Bob Kelly’s stand-up show.

Well, it's Stephen King  See, that's exciting right there  To go, wow, that's Stephen King  And he's reading from one of his novels  Yeah, John Irving  But then after  Then after two, three minutes  I'm thinking, okay  Alright, that's Stephen King  And he's still reading  No, because the story was pretty cool  You know, it was a part out of  The Body  Which was the short story  Is there a beginning and an ending?  Yeah, yeah  Or is he just like  It's, it's a  Or does he just go  I'll read, uh, page, uh, 123 today  No, no  It was like, uh, Lardass's Revenge 
[00:03:30]  It was a piece of the story  That, you know, you could absolutely  Get from beginning to end  In a pie-eating contest segment  You know, where the fat kid  Eats the pies  And proceeds to vomit  And plans it this way  Because they have this pie-eating contest  All the time  And, uh, every year  And he set it up  Where he would just vomit  And it started the whole town vomiting  And, and the way, you know, Stephen King  Is reading, you know, he wrote it  And he's reading the goddamn thing  And, uh, it was very funny 
[00:04:00]  Very entertaining  And it's Stephen King  When did the locals start eating each other?  Because, like, when does it get scary?  No, it wasn't one of those  I know, it wasn't one of those  It was more of a funny  Kind of really gross vomit  Oh, like the puke doesn't mean something  Like there's not a puke  No  There's not a puke creature  No, it wasn't one of those  A puke creature  No puke creatures came out  No rats  No brand new disease happens  Because the whole town's puking  No, no  It's just pure comedy  No child-killing clown  Nothing like that 
[00:04:30]  No  It was, uh, funny and gross  The people don't end up  Turning in to puke themselves  No  And haunting the people  That didn't puke  They didn't  Right  Nothing like that  You gotta love Stephen King books  And, uh, John Irving came out  And, uh, read, uh, something  That was very funny  I'm not familiar with a lot of his stuff  Yeah  Book-wise  I don't know who he is  Wrote, uh, Cider House Rules  Uh, it's a great book  Yeah  Uh, guy's very, uh, charismatic  He was, uh, very interesting  Great voice 
[00:05:00]  And then, uh, J.K. Rowling  Who, you know, they were  A bunch of kids  The Harry Potter chick  Yeah, a bunch of kids up in the balcony  It was just like  When she came out  It was like deafening  Screeches of little kids  And then she came out  And read a little, you know, thing  And all the kids are going crazy  And all I think of  I think of those things like  Really terrible  You know, if you're in church  Or at a funeral  You just think the most horrible thing  You could do  Let me run up and tip the casket over 
[00:05:30]  You know, you get those thoughts  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And I think the difference  Between being sane and insane  Is the sane people get those thoughts  But you just don't do them  Yeah  And insane people actually do these things  But you get the thoughts  But you have the part of your brain  That keeps you  No, you're not going to really do that  But you run through a scenario  And go, oh my god  How awful would this be?  You know, if I ran up  And just started smacking around the corpse  Remember when we went to a taping  I think it was, uh, Bill Maher  In L.A. 
[00:06:00]  Way back in the day  Uh-huh  The whole time I was sitting in the audience  I'm thinking  Man, I want to jump over the rail  And just tackle him  Yeah, just tackle him  Just tackle him  Make the news  I don't even remember what he was talking about  Or what the show was about  Because that's all I was thinking in my head  Like, how much fun would it be  Just to jump over and tackle him?  Yeah  So I was thinking  If I ran up on the stage  And grabbed J.K. Rowling  And held a knife to her throat  And made her tell the ending  To the last book  In front of all the people 
[00:06:30]  Like, that would make the news  Yeah, that would get  How much time would I do?  But the ending would make more news  Than what you actually did  Yeah, exactly  Like, oh, and a stunning twist  By the way, she said it  Because  That would be  Sex and church DJ  Decided to, you know  That would be the biggest story  Sex and church DJ  Ending a book  You start getting all warm  Because, like, your brain starts taking over  Yeah, your brain starts processing  And then you start thinking  The act  I really want to do this  Like, oh my god  And you get all nervous 
[00:07:00]  Like, you're going to do it  Right  And people know you're going to do it  Well, how stupid is that?  I know  Your body starts reacting like  All right, we're going to do this, right?  We are going to  Yeah  Because your body doesn't know  Your body's just a stupid hunk of meat  Yeah  It's your brain that keeps you from doing it  Yeah  But your body starts preparing for it  Yeah  All right, man, I'm ready  You tell me  I'm ready  Just tell me what  You give the word, brain  Anytime  I'm off  My legs  The legs are ready  The arms are ready  And then you've got to tell your body  What are you, an idiot?  Calm down  This is a jackass 
[00:07:30]  It's a drill, right?  Freaking  Stand down  Freaking  That voice starts taking over  Oh, God  Oh, will you just shut up?  Oh, is that horrible?  Yeah, you start getting all sweaty  And then your chick looks at you like  What's wrong?  Are you okay?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I'm fine  I was just going to kill JK Rowling  But don't worry about it  I'm not  I was debating if I should run up on stage  And take her hostage  My body had completely prepared for it  Right  Thank goodness my brain decided to stand down  Because I was ready to go  I was on ready alert 
[00:08:00]  You think it's just us  Or do other people out there  Have to say make that crap?  No, other people do it all the time  That's good to know  It's one of those  It's one of those horrific things that happen  That you just  Like I said, sane people don't do it  Insane people don't have that filter in their head  And they actually do it  Right  Because you want to do it just to be silly and have fun  A little silly  Hold a knife to someone's throat  Well, we were sitting there waiting for the festivities to start about 7.30  And they start introducing  The lights go down 
[00:08:30]  Big applause  Like 6,000 people in Radio City  And they go to introduce the hostess of the evening  Who's going to introduce the other people that are going to introduce the people  Before the big reveal  Before the big reveal  Did you have any idea who the host was?

[00:11:30]  We don't give a crap  About Whoopi  And her stupid radio show  But for some reason  We're connected with her  These days  And my brain  Is starting to agree  With my body  Knowing that it would  Be huge news  If I just went up there  And tweaked her cans  Or something  Now I'm  I'm sure you were  Getting recognized  At Radio City Music Hall  To begin with  I was keeping  A pretty low profile  Yeah  Uh no  Nobody really  Recognized me  It was a bunch of snobs  I got a couple of looks 
[00:12:00]  A couple of looks  Yeah but  But the section we were in  Was really like  High security  The section  You were in the front row  It was  And it was section  You weren't in a section  You were on the stage  There was only three rows  For the people that  Bought the tickets on auction  There was the front row  And then there was  Two rows behind us  And that was it  And then  Then there was a big  Gate-like thing  And you know  You had to get through it  Nice  Yeah so it was like  Pretty high security  She had no clue  You were right there  In front of her  No  No  No clue 
[00:12:30]  And with the way  The lights are  You can never see  The crowd  I wish  You know  It would have been cool  To kind of  You know  Have her see  But no  She didn't  Were there any  Celebrities there with you?  Celebrities  I kind of scanned  The crowd  Who brought up  Let's see  John Stewart  Okay  Was there  He brought up  A J.K. Rowling  Yeah  He said Rowling  And all you heard  Was a bunch of kids  Go  Rowling 
[00:13:00]  Rowling  Yelling at him  For getting it wrong  Yeah  And then  Soledad  Who I'm watching  On the news  Right now  On CNN  Soledad O'Brien  How would you  Recognize her?  She was there  How would I?  I never would have  She's like  She's one of the  Top anchors  On CNN  She's very hot  I never would have  She's probably  The number one  They got  I don't think  There's any  Female news lady  I would recognize  And she was on  The Today Show  For many many years  Diane Sawyer  Connie Chung  But most of them  Chicks I would never  Recognize  And then 
[00:13:30]  What was his name?  I don't know  Some black guy  Money  Athlete  No  He's been in movies  And stuff  Usually plays a cop  Yeah  I don't remember his name  Denzel Washington  No  Kind of looked like him  Samuel Jackson  No  Kind of looked like him  So how was Whoopi?  Whoopi  Whoopi was pretty funny  Yeah  I gotta say  When she's in that  Kind of atmosphere  You know  Kind of an MC  Hostess kind of thing  She was reading off  A little teleprompter 
[00:14:00]  That was in the podium  And  It was  There were a couple of jokes  That she didn't feel  Were really funny  And she skipped through them  In a funny kind of way  And  You know  Played off of  Little mistakes  On the teleprompter  Pretty well  She does that good  You know  Well that's her thing  She's good on stage  Yeah  Yeah that's her thing  That's her thing  It's like  Get a radio guy to do that  And he'd look really bad  Yeah  You know  That's what we're getting at  She stinks at doing radio  And we're having fun  Calling her out on it  She's got a good career 
[00:14:30]  As a  Comic actress  You know  The press doesn't get  Anything right though  Because  We've been going at it  With Whoopi Goldberg  For the last two days  Just because we can  And because it's fun  That's the only reason  We're doing it  We're not scared of her  And her stupid show  And the press is getting it all wrong  They think Whoopi gave it to us  And showed us  Yeah really gave it to us  Who said that?  What press?  It's the latest article  That came out today on it  It's got a little  It's got a little viral thing  Going on here  The story is spreading 
[00:15:00]  And as it spreads  They're getting all their facts wrong  Getting things wrong  Whoopi told them  Is one of the articles  Was getting at  Maybe they do that  Just to make it more interesting  Because it's almost like  O&A kick another set of teeth in  Well one reporter said that  O&A's pest tried to get into  The Whoopi show  But they were screening the calls  That's false  We got three or four calls in  No problem  And that Whoopi showed us  Because she made the stupid  Howard Stern comment  That like Howard's her friend  That showed us what? 
[00:15:30]  And that we don't deserve  To what?  To walk in his dust  On the same dust  That he walks on  Yeah whatever  Sorry  Had a pretty good radio career  Going for a dozen or so years  Lady  Yeah and ignore the fact  That we beat the crap out of her  For like three straight hours  On our show  Yeah  She didn't get us  Using her own material  Against her  It wasn't even close  Her own lousy material  It wasn't even close  They called the game  Ah I gotta call out  Steve from Bayshore  No I wasn't disappointed  That the author of Mein Kampf 
[00:16:00]  Didn't come out  And do a reading  Steve  You know what would be funny too  By the way  If the J.K. Rowling  Decided that she was so sick  Of stupid Harry Potter  And in the final one  The wizard just says  You know what  I don't want to be a wizard  And he says  I'm going to work at Staples  And that's how the whole series ends  I think they would still love it  There's nothing this woman  Could do wrong  And I'll tell you something  Opie brought up the point  That a lot of these people  That started reading her books  Are older now  They're not kids  Those books came out years ago 
[00:16:30]  How long ago?  Eight years ago  Was the first one maybe?  Somewhere around there?  You get kids  That were in their teens  Are now in their 20s  Early 20s  And they had a question  Answer period at the end  Oh boy  And you just want to punch  The jackass that gets up  And by the way  When they get up  They're on the big screen  And you look  And you can tell  Exactly what author  They're going to ask  A question of  You know what Stephen King's  Readers look like  You know what John Irving's  Readers look like  And J.K.'s readers 
[00:17:00]  So these girls would get up  And ask J.K. Rowling a question  And I swear to you  I thought it was that SNL  William Shatner  Star Trek goof  Where he's at the convention  And people ask them  Hypothetical questions  About Star Trek  The Enterprise  The gear  The equipment  And he just goes  It's a TV show  Get a life  I fully expected her to say that  Because people are coming up  And believe me  I don't know enough  About the story  To even make up 
[00:17:30]  A hypothetical situation  About the Harry Potter series  You haven't watched the movies?  No  I watched the first one  And I couldn't tell you  One thing about it  They get a bad rap man  The movies are not  Kid movies  Here's the most thing  I know about Harry Potter  It's the most I know  That a toy broom  Was put out  That vibrated  And had to be pulled  Off the market  Because too many  Young girls were enjoying it  Were getting off  Way too early  In their class  That was it  And they pulled it  From the market  That's all I know  About the Harry Potter saga 
[00:18:00]  Yeah right  But these girls  Would get up  And start asking  These hypothetical questions  About the characters  Why she chose  Certain ingredients  For the wands  I mean this type of crap  That's purely hypothetical  And I just  I wished she would have  Been able to stand up  And give that Shatner response  Of just  Hey it's a book  I made this crap up  But she answered  Every question seriously right  Yeah she's got like  A reason why  Once she's done though  Don't forget  She's still writing them  Once she's finished  Then she'll probably  Start slamming them  Maybe 
[00:18:30]  Because she says  It's over  You know  This is it  The last one  People are going to die  In it  Perhaps Harry himself  How many books is this  It's going to be seven  Is it up to seven  Like her seventh book  And then  They had a video clip  Montage of all the authors  Before they came out  And they have a clip of her  Holding the end of the story  The end of the seventh book  In a big  Like heavy envelope  And she was like  Holding it like it was gold  Of course  And petrified  That the camera was going to  See through the envelope  And she said  She wrote that ending 
[00:19:00]  Like in 1990  The ending to book seven  And she knew about  Like how this was going  To end years ago  So she's not going  To change it  Please let it be  He's on a bed  Shivering in a robe  And sipping broth  While a friend  While one of his wizard friends  Walks his dog  When they have to go  To the hospital  And embarrassingly  Ask the doctor  To remove the wand  That just turns up  An x-ray  That turns up  On the web  Did he swallow that? 
[00:19:30]  Not exactly  Yeah  He was painting  On a ladder  And he fell  That old gag  That old trophy gag  So it sounded like  You had a wonderful night  It was a lot of fun  You know  I thought it was going to be  It was more something  For my girlfriend at first  Because she's a really  Big Stephen King fan  Yeah  And I am too  I think Stephen King  Is great  I love his stuff  And to see him  It sounds silly  To sit in a big room  Full of people  And watch someone read  It does sound silly  So I was just kind of 
[00:20:00]  You know  Ah whatever  But really  Something very cool  To watch  Right on  Is the author  Actually reading  Stephen King  I was flying home  From somewhere  And I had such an urge  To read some of It  Which is like the first  Stephen King book  I've read  It's about the clown  That murders children  Yeah  It's great  That's what I like  About Stephen King  About it  There's no happy thing  In there  Like you'd see in a movie  Where you think  The kid buys it  Or something  And all of a sudden  They're fine  It's one of those things  He kills off children  In horrific ways 
[00:20:30]  Family pets  You know  Loved ones  He doesn't care  It's great  Dean Kuntz  He stinks  He gets sick  With the kid deaths  Does he  Brutal  He is so much  So much  Worse than Stephen King  Really  With kid death  Oh god  I gave up reading  Reading his crap  You know why  I didn't like Dean Kuntz  I don't think I only read  One or two things he wrote  There was times  Where I thought  He like cheated  Like went from point A 
[00:21:00]  To point B  Too fast  Like Stephen King  Walks you through  Like you're not breaking  Into like a high security area  And Stephen King  Is such a genius  I know a lot of people  Out there  Who think you're like  Literary people  Oh we don't like Stephen King  Shut up  Yeah they think he's a hacker  Yeah really is he  I don't know  Because he's sold  Too many books  I don't know about that  How many people  Think he's a hack  There are snobs  That think he's a hack  They're dummies  They're absolute dummies  Because he's actually  Just as interesting  When he writes non-fiction  Well there's dummies  When it comes to everything  But I think in general  Stephen King  Gets a great reputation  He's loved by the public

[00:28:00]  The guy  In the 70's  For putting out  Porno  And it wasn't like  The real hardcore porn  It was kind of  Well this predates porn  Well  60's or 70's  There was porn  In the 60's  And 70's  This was early 70's  Maybe late 60's  Yeah but porn was  You know  Like bootlegging  Yeah it was  You know  8mm film  That you kind of like  You had to meet some dude  On the corner  In the middle of the night  Right  And he would hand you  A brown paper 
[00:28:30]  You know package  This was actual  You know  Commercialized  This is like  Stuff you saw in theaters  That played exclusively  You know  Dirty movies  You know  The X rated movies  And they had like  Little stories  Or  They weren't hardcore  Not like now  Where it's you know  You're going to be seeing  Some heavy duty work  Going on  These are PG-13 now  Yeah  Yeah it's like nothing  Just bosoms  It really is  Like PG-13  Yeah exactly  Stan just did it  It's like when a woman  Pushes her chest out 
[00:29:00]  And shakes it back and forth  Yeah  You know  You know what though  I went and saw  The new Will Ferrell movie  Last night  Talladega Nights  The story of  Ricky Jones whatever  Ricky Bobby  Bobby Ricky  Whatever  The movie was  Really really funny  Will Ferrell has  Another hit on his hands  But I think we were saying  This yesterday  How they've taken  The breast shot  Out of movies  Remember every movie  You would go see  Whether it was like  Almost like a Disney film  Up to an R rated  They always had to have  That one scene 
[00:29:30]  Crack-tuitous  Where the girl is just  Naked for no reason  Or topless for no reason  And we were just  Discussing this yesterday  That they've pretty much  Taken that out of the ball game  You don't get the  The quick topless shot anymore  No  And in this movie  There's a scene  Where a girl is flashing  Will Ferrell  And this girl I guess  Becomes his wife  I'm not giving much away  Trust me  But as she goes  As she goes to flashing  The whole theater is like  Expecting  Alright here it goes  The topless shot  That every movie has 
[00:30:00]  They go in  They go in for a close up  And they just show her face  As she's flashing  And I'm like  Man we were just  Talking about this yesterday  How they've taken  The brush shot  Out of movies  Do you think though  That that was done on purpose  Because that sounds like  Something that's so  Annoying  Like you go  God damn it  Why  They almost did that  Like on purpose  To piss people off  Yeah yeah yeah  Just to be irritating  It could be  Because Will Ferrell  Likes to screw with you  A little bit with his movies  You know  But I don't know  Because we were just  Discussing how  Animal house 
[00:30:30]  Porky's  Yeah you get that  You get that fun  You know  Scene of the girl  Paddy Shack  Taked or topless  Or something  Who could forget  Lacey underalls  Lacey  In bed  With Noonan  That was sexy  Yeah  So  Anyway getting back to  Mondo topless  So this is a Russ Myers film  This is Smales in the shower  Loof of my stretch marks  Oh yeah  Loof of my stretch marks  Ah  So I found this  Mondo topless film  Years ago 
[00:31:00]  Yeah  And we used that  Palaver drop in the intro  Yeah that's Russ Myers  Actually our new intro  We're not using it  And it comes from  Mondo topless  I heard it today  This Russ Myers  Do we have it in the new one?  Yeah  Oh okay  I think it's become a staple  If I might  Oh okay  I'm sorry Steve  There was  Ah whatever  So we got more clips  From Mondo topless  Yeah  Today  And it kind of makes sense  To play these today  Because we're now being heard  On Free FM  In San Francisco  Yep  And this  He filmed his movies  A lot of them  In San Francisco 
[00:31:30]  Right  And I guess  You know  Back then  That's where you got  Your free  Spirited  Women  Who were willing  To do this  And they got topless  And it's Russ Meyer  Narrating  Yeah the whole movie  Is just girls  Topless  Dancing to rock and roll music  Yeah  Bad old rock music  Groovy music  Fake rock and roll music  Yeah  Because they couldn't use  The real rock and roll music  He got huge  With Super Vixens  In the 70s  That was like his movie  And then when cable TV 
[00:32:00]  Really was in it's infancy  And they would show  Like the same movie  Over and over again  At night  Well they needed  The song porn  On the weekends  Yeah  Late at night  Like one in the morning  They would show  Things like cheerleaders  And Super Vixens  Last Tango in Paris  Like anything that was  Had some type of porn in it  They had really bad dubs  Like when the line  Had to be redone  Like where they didn't  Get sound from the room  Oh yeah  Talking about something  And then you'd hear the voice  Like that obviously  Didn't come from that mouth  That person 
[00:32:30]  Yeah  It didn't matter though  But you'd sit there  And you know  Flip over the big  Cinemax switch  Or the cable switch  And turn a key  It was like the big  Involved thing you had to do  Is that after Wameco?  Wameco Home Theater  WHT  The movie network  You know  I was Cinema 100  Out on Long Island  And you did  You had this box  With a switch on it  And a key  And you have to  Turn the key  Flip the switch  And there you are  Looking at smut  I gotta tell you  I am so distracted  Because E-Rock  Is playing the Vixen trailer

[00:34:00]  And I can't get  Enough of the guy's  Voice  I think it's hilarious  He's so excited  You got it  This guy is so  Into his work  And that trailer  Is really sexy  I'm telling you  The women are sexy  They are like  They're like  Voluptuous  They have like  Their large breasts  They have really  Really like hips  Really sexy  They're very  Like 60s  And early 70s  Looking women  They got those bodies  That were in fashion  Like fun hairdos  Yeah  Before the anorexia  And bulimic look  Which becomes  So much the rage  You know they're not  Wearing business suits 
[00:34:30]  Like a girl  You can pick your teeth  With when you're done  Yeah  The type of girl  That you know  She wastes a meal  Right after you  Shove it down her throat  I like it  I hate myself  That a girl  Wear short skirts  When you're vomiting  Out the car window  I can have a little pixie  Just think of it  As a celery stalk  And it could throw up later  You know  Screw our radio  Screw our radio show today  There you go  I repeated that  Because I stumbled  Go to YouTube  And just get the  Russ Meyers trailers  Because now I'm watching  Beyond the Valley

[00:35:30]  Death defying  And rampaging  Up and down  Hill and Dale  Digesting and disgorging  Humanity at will  I love the piano  And that's my favorite part  Of that  Yeah  Awful thing  An old silent movie piano  Playing in front of the screen  He's talking about sex  He's talking about girls  That are well endowed  Pulsating  Over hill and dale  This has nothing to do  With the cable cars  In San Francisco  He's trying to make  Cable cars sexy  And he did  And the hot  Rice-a-roni picture 
[00:36:00]  Ad on the back  Listen to what he has to say  About Koi Tower  San Francisco is a city  Of religious respect  And authority  And democratically  There are those  Who are in disagreement  San Francisco's art colony  Is dominated by the arrogant  And imposing Koi Tower  Thrusting its bulk  Majestically to the sky  With the Broadway tunnel  Offering a yawning orifice  Through which to enter  Fabled North Beach 
[00:36:30]  A yawning orifice  Is he talking about tunnels  And towers  I think he's talking about  Some chick  That's passed out cold  One of his vixens  Yeah  And then he finally  Starts getting into  The art of the topless  The art of the topless  Is there art to topless  Yeah  The way he puts it  No  The art of the topless  That just didn't catch on  Unfortunately  All natural girls too  Yeah  You won't find any implants  In any of his movies

[00:50:30]  Babbitt baby  Love that guy  Oh he's a really good egg  We've just touched the surface  That's the first 10-15 minutes of the film  Basically  It goes on  I've never seen the end of the film  So maybe we can see what  Maybe we can all watch it together later  Maybe  What all the hubbubs about  I'm telling you  As people file in to the ONA traveling virus  It can be fun to have on the huge screen  I'd go to a reading that he was doing  No kidding  Alright we gotta take a break  Look we're really late  We got uh Doug Stanhope on hold  Oh good 
[00:51:00]  Tripping and laughing his ass off  Oh brother  Doug stay right there  We'll talk to you next  It's the ONA virus spreading across America  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony wow stickers are your tickets to a successful whip them out Wednesday  Well yeah  Did you know that wow stickers have many other uses?  I sliced out both my kidneys  And I patched up the wounds with wow stickers  But but dude how do you pee?  Oh boy can't pee  This was incredibly nearsighted  Opie and Anthony  Just before break we got word that Doug Stanhope was on the line 
[00:51:30]  Yes  Tripping and laughing his ass off  Ladies and gentlemen  Doug Stanhope  Is there any other kind of tripping?  Hi Doug  No usually when you're tripping 
[00:52:00]  PR kind of radio right?  The what?  That where I should keep my P's and Q's right?  Oh yeah yeah  Yeah some P's some Q's you know  I'm just making sure  Just  You know the game  Yeah  What did you  Hey what did you take Doug?  Oh well  Actually we  Well we've been doing mushrooms all night  Wow  But we just invented our own cocktail  Because they didn't know if we should keep tripping or go to bed 
[00:52:30]  So we made a  We call it the Xanadu  It was a  We blended up Xanax  With equal amounts of mushroom caps  In a coffee grinder  And poured it into  Jager shot  Oh  Xanadu  Xanadu  We called it a Xanadu  Wow  Yeah  We invented it  Yeah I would say you did  I don't think anyone else would have come up with that 
[00:53:00]  What else could a Xanadu be?  Two glasses  One totally empty  And one with milk  I'm not  So um  But if you find out about a bar selling them  I'm a regular  It's you  Wow man  So you  You're really feeling good  Oh yeah  We're trashed  I gotta go over to Scotland  In like a day  What are you doing over there?  The Fringe Festival  I gotta be there for a whole month  So now I'm like practicing  For being absolutely out of my mind all the time 
[00:53:30]  Because UK comics  You make American comics look like douchebags  Like yeah  Norton gets peed on and stuff  And we're just so  You know  We're out of the norm  Dude  What are you gonna  You're so wasted  How are you gonna get your  How are you gonna get your  Your drugs over there?  Oh  They have drugs over there  Over there  It's like the old days of  Having fun in America 
[00:54:00]  Remember that?  Remember when fun used to happen  We didn't have to invent it  Or just make fun of other people  That have it  Listen  Yeah  They're still in those days  Like they don't have websites  Or  They're still like just raw  The good comics I know over there  CD  What?  No  I'm still coming in with a beer  At 8am  Doug is the worst nightmare  Of everybody  That does anti-drug ads 
[00:54:30]  Because he's the one  He just makes it sound  So much fun  Like so much fun  Like something you wanna do  No bad stories right?  You're just having fun  Well  Well no  You die at the end  That's the bad story  I mean for all of us  But  Yeah  Why at some point  Do you have to go  Well okay  That was fun  When we were at Mardi Gras  And we were 22  But fun must not have been real 
[00:55:00]  Yeah  Have you guys been having  Some of those deep thoughts tonight?  Some of those way out thoughts?  We started having conversations  About stuff that you don't remember  The next day  But it was so deep  Like  You were curing the world's ills  In one evening  And then the next day  You forgot it  Or you remember it  And it sounded ridiculous  Yeah  Captain  I've been doing this  I've been doing this stuff  For a lot of decades 
[00:55:30]  So  It's not like  A way out thought  That I don't remember  Is out of the ordinary  It's not like  I'm experimenting  I'm almost 40 years old  For Christ's sake  What have you guys  Been talking about tonight though?  We've been talking about  I don't know  What have you been talking about  When you were off the air  And you could talk  Without the FCC  Busting your butt  Well we were talking  We were talking about  Crazy things that go  Through your head sometimes  When like you're at a funeral  And you kind of get it  In your head 
[00:56:00]  Standing up  And maybe pushing the casket  Over  And what a ruckus  That would make  But your brain  Kind of tells your body  Not to do it  Alright  We've been talking  About the same thing  My buddy Joby  One  His best friend  Just blew his brains out  And he was a little  Reticent to trip tonight  Because it just happened  Yeah  That would kind of  Make a bad trip  If he starts  Thinking about it  My mother's like  Hopefully gonna die soon  She's on fucking  On emphysema  I just  I swallowed that F word 
[00:56:30]  Yeah  But I didn't think  You swallowed enough of it  No  His mom's got emphysema  No my mom  Oh your mom  Don't you man?  Yeah  She's gonna  Yeah  Norton knows mother  Yeah yeah yeah  I like your mom  Yeah she's  She's a funny mom  To everyone else  But to me  She's just annoying  And I hope she dies soon  She's a joyless douche  And uh  A joyless  Does she smoke  Or did she smoke  There's nothing left  In her life  Except to be alive 
[00:57:00]  And yeah  I hope she dies soon  And uh  So yeah  We've been talking  About stuff  But that doesn't  Freak you out  When you're tripping  Like to start thinking  About that kind of thing  Because then you start  Thinking about your own  Mortality  It makes you laugh  When you're tripping  Because you realize  That we die at the end  It's all this ego  Like Hollywood stuff  That makes you laugh  Like you're just  Watching like  Any kind of entertainment  Tonight  Kind of stuff  Like who takes this seriously  How can I continue 
[00:57:30]  Making jokes  Like I care about this  Because  You die at the end  Like everything  You're doing now  Is based on that fact  I go on stage  Every night  With that thought  Why even try  You're just gonna die  At the end of it  Dude  I thought you  Don't you  Don't you and your mom  Get along really good  Yeah  Oh no  No I've hated her  For ten years  Are you serious  Since she moved in  With me  And she's been a liability  She made herself  A liability to me  And she will 
[00:58:00]  Make no steps  Towards getting  She's completely  Disability  Disability  And all that  She can take care of herself  But she chooses not to  Okay  And I don't have the time  To go through the like  Problems of  You know  The red tape  Well  Yeah  Get on the dole baby  Do you have to do things  Like clean her up  And stuff  No  No  She's not that  But  But she was  Like  They had to airlift her  For emphysema  To the hospital  Like  To the ER 
[00:58:30]  And they had to  Vacuum her  Vacuum out her lung  Oof  What the hell  Was she smoking  Well she's been smoking  Cool menthol  For 48 years  Or something  Yeah  She had her on a ventilator  And I'm sitting there  Watching her die  I thought she was  Going to die for sure  And I'm watching her die  On a ventilator  After they had to  Suction out her lungs  While she was  Aware of it  And I'm still  Looking down  At her going  That makes me 
[00:59:00]  Want a cigarette  Jesus  That was an honest reaction  Dude  Yeah  Does she still smoke  I still smoke  No  Does she still smoke  I'm about to light one  Does your mom still smoke  Oh yeah  Well actually  She's been on the patch  For five days  Like it's gonna  How is the patch  A bigger  Like  Deterrent  Or a bigger reminder  Than  Vacuuming your lungs out  Like how  She's really hooked  On the smoking  I guess  Exactly  Yeah  And you're smoking too 
[00:59:30]  So you're probably  Gonna have like  The same fate  Well yeah  I think I could die  From a lot of things  Sooner  I hope to not  Have the same fate  Right  I hope to have  One of my other  Fates greet me first  Greet me  I just wrote  A big update  And we're tripping  I go  You know  This is a perfect call  Because I just wrote  A big update  About ONA  For my site 
[01:00:00]  And my  Douchebag  Web guy  Didn't get it up  I'm working all day  On it  And then I just  Clicked on it  My update  Is not up on my site  Wait did you talk  About us  On your website  Well no  You guys had  Mentioned me  A week or two ago  Anytime you guys  Mention me  I get a flood  Of MySpace emails  Which is very cool  No we thought  It was really cool  That you gave us  Props on your latest CD  Oh well  You gave us a little  Shout out from the stage  And then you couldn't 
[01:00:30]  Understand why  The Howard Stern fans  And the Opie and Anthony fans  Can't get along  Or something like that  Yeah I know  But  And that was  Kind of the point  Of the whole thing  Like  I actually had to  Take out part of the update  Because I tried to  Assimilate  Like  Dane Cook  Is my comedy nemesis  Uh huh  But he has been forever  And I tried to  Put that into the update  But it was like  Too convoluted  And I re-read it  Like 
[01:01:00]  Dane Cook  Is someone I  Like I hate  As a comic  But I don't have  A problem with him  As a guy  Believe  I live in a town  Of 6,000 people  Right now  Where the hell  You live  Jesus  It's the Arizona  Down on the Mexican border  And I took a month off  Easy to skip over  This line if he needs to  Huh  I said I took a month off  Because I thought  I needed it  Right  And I just  Tell my buddy  As we were tripping  If Dane Cook  And Larry the Cable Guy  Walked into my local bar 
[01:01:30]  After a month off  In a small town like this  I would have hugged them  As though they were  Dead relatives  Just to have someone  To communicate with  You can't  Like alright  You really have no one  To talk to  Rivalry and artists  Whatever  Alright we can talk  Like human beings  Doug why'd you move  To that little teeny town  I don't know  Midlife crisis  Or  I don't  Midlife crisis  You buy a vet 
[01:02:00]  Or something  Yeah  I had to get out of LA  It was just  Like that  Ego nonsense  Was  I think we're gonna move  To Austin  In January  You're just  You're just  Wow  You're like Cain  From Kung Fu  What do you think about  Only stoned  What do you think about  Mel Gibson  I hate the Jews  Doug doesn't care  No I hate the Jews too  You do  Yeah 
[01:02:30]  For what reason  Because  I only hate the Jews  That have to bring up  That they're a Jew  Why do you have to  Keep saying they're a Jew  That was the first thing  I thought  Because I don't watch  The news when I'm off  Yeah  And I put it on  And there was  It was  Like 56 minutes  Of Hezbollah  Yeah  Which is  The Jews  And then  There was a  Five minute  Here's a  What if revelation  Is really coming upon us 
[01:03:00]  And then  Finally we'll end it  With a human interest piece  About Mel Gibson  Aiding the Jews  And getting a DUI  Next time  If I get a DUI  I don't drive drunk  Because I'm so overdue  For a DUI  You figure you've been lucky  So  Oh it's hugely lucky  Yeah  But if I do  I'm going to go  I hate the Jews  Can I get pressed  I have to  I have to live down  This man show thing  Can you arrest me 
[01:03:30]  Geez  I get girls gone wild  I got to get out of my  To be a respectable  Comic again  Not only do I hate the Jews  But I'll be appearing  At the Houston Improv  But no  I just hate  If you came up to me  And go  You know what  Because as a Lutheran  And you prefaced  Everything as being  As a Lutheran  What does that matter  You would hate  The Lutherans 
[01:04:00]  Yeah  They're Jews  Well you know  Because I have a Jewish background  What does Jew mean  Shut the fuck  I don't know  I think  I think too much of the sea  Got in that time  But  Doug  Doug  You ever  You're down in Arizona  And you do peyote  Just  Just mushrooms  Mushrooms  No  Okay  I was going to ask you  If you ever  Had one of those  Like Indian  Kind of  No we did  Me and Tom Rose  Did the other night  On the same batch  Of mushrooms  On our bellies 
[01:04:30]  Vomiting  And in our own waist  I urinated  In my own pants  For almost an hour  On a heavy dose  Of the same mushrooms  But we did mescaline  In the desert  This May  And that was the first time  I found mescaline  But yeah  People don't do good drugs anymore  They do tweak  And they're all  Coked up  And it's all like  Pointless drugs  I haven't even heard of  I haven't even heard of anybody 
[01:05:00]  That's done mescaline  In 20 years  That was one of my favorite drugs  I never found it  Until this year  Mescaline just made you laugh  Yeah exactly  Just giggle  Oh that's fantastic  No I watch mountains melt  It's one of the most miraculous  And I'm 40 years old  You watch mountains melt  In the desert man  Oh it's fantastic  Wow  Yeah I watched french fries  Under a heat lamp once  Just turned  Like a kaleidoscope  It looked like  Every single french fry  Was a different color 
[01:05:30]  And was changing colors  Like chameleons  Oh  Really amazing  Have you ever had a bad trip?  I didn't have many trips  And I wouldn't trip  If  I probably tripped like  And it was always mescaline  Probably about  Three or four times tops  Once was at a Van Halen concert  And it was the first time  I ever did it  84?  Yeah probably  Around 84 or something  And it was at a Van Halen concert  At the Nassau Coliseum  Out on Long Island  And I 
[01:06:00]  I took it  And didn't know  It hadn't hit me  Everybody else is like  Dude I'm peaking  This is great  You know  Van Halen's up there  Kicking ass  And everyone's laughing  On the way out  So I'm like  Dude I'm driving  You guys are all  Too screwed up  I didn't make it  Out of the parking lot  Before it hit me  Full blast  It starts raining  So the wipers  Had to be turned on  And they're going like  Cha-cook  Cha-cook  Cha-cook  Cha-cook  And streaking  The  Every light  Like the stop lights 
[01:06:30]  And the street lights  Would streak  Because of the rain  And that made it even worse  And the radio  Started talking to me  Like  And I just started  Laughing my ass off  I didn't know  I was going down  The parkway  I didn't know  If I was doing  Five or  Eighty miles an hour  I was driving  All paranoid  But laughing  It was  That was the first time  But after that  Probably three more times  But never had a bad one  But I would never do it  If I was in like 
[01:07:00]  A bad place  Or in a bad mood  Or if my mother  Had emphysema  That's the thing you learn  When you're younger  Yeah  That's why you call it  Experimentation  You learn  Yeah I'm going to  Clean up my whole house  Because discord  Makes me crazy  I want a comfortable  Safe place to do this  Away from authority figures  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  And then we  Ridicule  The way we live  I couldn't do it  After a friend's death  Or if my mother  Had emphysema  Like that  I  I couldn't trip 
[01:07:30]  I  I had a bad time once  Just smoking too much weed  And watching  Grey lady down  It's some Charlton Heston  Submarine movie  And they  They went down  And I got into an accident  And the sub was sunk  At the bottom of the ocean  And they were trapped  And they couldn't get out  Yeah yeah  Dude I freaked out  I felt like I was in the sub  And had like the worst  Anxiety attack  I had to run into my room  I was pretty much  In the fetal position  Sucking my thumb  It was one of the most awful 
[01:08:00]  I didn't watch bad Charlton Heston movies  While you're tripping  We just watched a movie  At the end of a trip  Just to try to come down  And that's when we discovered  These Xanadu shots  Xanadu  To decide whether we should  Keep tripping  Or go to bed  And tripping won  But yeah  Like yeah  You gotta be in a good place  Self reflection  Like  And this  Oh I wish 
[01:08:30]  The update was out  Watch my site later  Like after I bust my  Webmaster's balls  Some guy  Like when you mention me  Whatever you mention me  Like I always get a flood  Of MySpace  But I get this  Like perfect  MySpace email  From a fan of yours  And in the worst  English  Like worst  Hey you  Like you have to  Decipher  What he's trying to say  You know the MySpace

[01:14:30]  It's dangling in my face  It's a memory  You have a mic  With a stand  Man  Ah yeah  I think he actually  Had a crush on  Dano  Who doesn't  The kid's got energy  He's got the look  Who doesn't like him  He's getting out soon  Right  That's what we're hearing  We're hearing Pereno  He's getting out of prison soon  That's what we're hearing  He got put in for man  Man  That's it  Man  No not man  Man and boy  Yeah  There was some kind of problem  He had driving around  The Washington D.C. area  With playstations 
[01:15:00]  And handing them out  To some young gentleman  On the street  That may not have been of age  And inviting them back  To his place  To play some playstation  Sounds  It sounds like a good idea  Sounds very innocent  To get to know people  In the neighborhood  I'd call that St. Nick  Yeah not everyone  Can afford a playstation  Yeah  What's wrong with that  Well let's put it this way  As a kid was playing  The playstation  Let's just say Mark 
[01:15:30]  Wouldn't have been able  To comment  On how well  He was doing at the time  You mean he couldn't  Have been able to whistle  Right  Whistling out of the question  Like if you said  Hey Mark  Whistle me a tune  It would have been like this  Exactly  Could have been a problem  Doing anything like that  Whistling  Talking  And the poor person  Playing playstation  You gotta hold the joystick up  Maneuver around the head  Right  It's very hard  Absolutely  So what they did 
[01:16:00]  Was he  I guess  Got found out  And threw him in the  The old clink  I heard he liked  He was a fan  Of the African American  Yeah  He was  Young  Young black children  Which you know  In D.C.  To be a white guy  And go to jail for that  I'm sure is not a problem  No no  That's because it costs more  To get a white kid  To get that done  More than a Sony Playstation  Black people do it  For a Sony Playstation  Bob raises an  Interesting economic point 
[01:16:30]  Right  I think it's good  Sony Playstation  A hundred bucks  Yeah you try to get  A white kid  For that  They're like  My mom bought me  One of those  Any more racial comments  There  Mel Kelly  I don't want freedom  Except for them  Except for them  Those people  That's a good lie  Yeah so he's  Getting out soon  Yeah I guess  Whatever  We got mousetrap  Mousetrap trivia 
[01:17:00]  In a little bit here  For a thousand dollars  Who plays that  You were probably  In the green room  With the guys  I wasn't in the green room  I didn't see them  Oh you didn't see them  Yeah we got like  Four guys  That can answer questions  But they got to like  Stick their hands  In all sorts of mousetraps  The electric ones  Are going to be  The show stoppers  That's just the new technology  That is kicking ass  Man  Mousetraps  When they say  Reinvent the mousetrap  That was it  There's various devices  That just slap down  On the poor little guy's neck  And snap it  Or the old glue traps 
[01:17:30]  Those are fine too  But those electric ones  Are just the most fun  They crawl in  To the front  And there's like  A little  Kind of maze  That they got to go through  Real quick little  Corner they turn  A quick left turn  A quick left turn  And the bait  Is across  From these two metal contacts  Yeah  And when they step  On the metal contacts  Dead  It's over Johnny  Two seconds  Dead  Just  Just  Bam  I have a mouse problem  In my old place  You put the goodness 
[01:18:00]  On the back wall  And they never get  To the goodness  Peanut butter  A little piece of banana  They don't even get goodness  Before they die  But do you get to hear it  Like a fly one  You hear just like  A dip  You hear a quick fry  And a quick shake  And then a little red light  Blinks or something  Letting you know  You got one  Because they can't back up  Because they made that left turn  Yeah  So it's too late  Can you reuse it  Or is that it  I've been reusing the same one  You open the top  You pull them out  You throw them away  It's all set for the next  Poor victim  Well you can hear the mouse  Say with the microphone  It's like Pesci and Goodfellas 
[01:18:30]  When he walks in to be made  Oh no  No  When is the  It was nothing we could do  Couldn't be helped  Couldn't be helped  We had to shock him  I started with the regular mouse traps  But these bastards  They're too smart  They're able to get the cheese out  Without getting snapped  So I started getting really frustrated  So then I got the glue traps  But they don't tell you  On the glue traps  On the box  Yeah  That the thing is going to suffer for days  And you have to like smash it over the head  With something hard  The glue trap  Yeah  Because in the morning  I go to where they were coming out 
[01:19:00]  And there's a mouse  Just stuck  Alive  In the glue trap  It's cheeky  And you can't free them  Because their body is just  Just a mess  From being stuck on the trap  And they've been gnawing  At their own  At their own feet and stuff  Various appendages  Maybe they should tell you that  On the side of the mouse trap  That you're going to have to kill it  Yeah  It's bad  I've had those  So I did that once  And I was like  I can't  This is just  I can't do this  And then finally  The electric traps  They get the job done  Can't you just roll it up  Lethal injection  Yeah I know  They're wheeling the mouse 
[01:19:30]  Out on the gurney  They let off  A little mouse scream too  Do they  Oh it's just wonderful  To wake up to  And it's ears  Stuck on the glue trap  With no hope of getting free  I'm in it now  Oh good  Here comes this human  To help me  No  What do you just  Roll them up  Like a piece of paper  Can you do that  Can't you just like  Roll them up in it  You can't let the thing suffer  So I take it out back  And I just like  Take a cinder block  And drop it  Are you kidding 
[01:20:00]  What else are you going to do  There's a mouse holocaust  Going on in Opie's apartment  No  What else are you going to do  You  You can't  Just throw it out  You can't free them  You pick  No not free them  You pick up the  What to throw it in the garbage  And let it just suffer for days  Until it finally starts to death  No  If you pick up the paper  And crumble it  In on itself  That stickiness  Will go over his mouth  And nose  And he'll suffocate  Nah  And then you throw it away  Nah  It's like being in like  Trapped in the world  Trade centers  No  Yeah but it's for  It's a mouse  Let me know 
[01:20:30]  By the way  We were just babbling  To waste time  We found the LSD PSA  Ah see  See how good we are  See people how it works  See how good we are  It's called filler  No one gives a crap  Some people call us out on it  My mice problem  At this point  They go  Are you looking for something  Because I think this is filler  Alright  And we got  Hopefully Doug Stanhope  Still here  Doug  Hey I'm still here  Hey man  Alright before we let you go  So you can continue the trip  We gotta play this thing for you 
[01:21:00]  This is a real LSD PSA  That they played  Back in the day  We're thinking  Late 60s  Maybe early 70s  Alright  Alright  I'm with you  I'm just enjoying the show  I don't have XM  So I just  I'm happy just to listen to you  Oh we're not out there yet  Huh  We're not  In that 6,000  Person town  Well  This is Arizona  I'm in a town of 6,000 people  For Christ's sake  You know  That's a perfect  Perfect town for XM  You gotta get the XM  I'm sure local radio 
[01:21:30]  Is not getting it  Free series radio  Yeah  And it doesn't  I can't even get  The satellite out here  You probably get XM  There's a lot more repeaters  Alright here we go  The LSD PSA  Either one's better than terrestrial  What  What did I say  Alright here we go  Listen to you  Here we go  I first dropped acid  When I was 18  I was over at these people's house  One night  This guy I went to school with  Was over there 
[01:22:00]  And asked me if I wanted  To try some acid  Did he?  I had read about it  In the newspapers  And heard a few friends  Talk about it  So I was curious  I was pretty jacked up  On marijuana  So I decided to try it  Jacked up  And I dropped it  I don't know what  I was waiting for  A flash  Or a rush  Or whatever  But I kept sitting there  Waiting and waiting  And nothing was happening  So I got up  And then went to the dresser  And put on a pair  Of pink capris  And a green and brown blouse  I thought the colors  Sounds cute  So we 
[01:22:30]  Green and brown  Is asking for it  By the way you're dressed  As far as the Playstation  Oh she's a real looker  This one  Yeah  So far so good  So far  Sounds like a good enough day  She dropped a little acid  Or something  No real problem  No I got some  Pretty clothes on  For the year  1969  Whatever the hell it is  Horribly awry  It's groovy  And then I started hearing  Some music  So things can't go well 
[01:23:00]  Here we go  Here we go  It gets ugly  Yeah here we go  Back to it  So we tripped down to Market Street  And I decided to buy a hot dog  I was very hungry  And I had put mustard and ketchup  And relish in the usual  And I put the hot dog up to my mouth  And somebody started screaming 
[01:23:30]  I didn't know what was happening  So I looked up at my friend Terry  And said  Did you hear that?  Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said no  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again  And I was ready to bite  And the scream got louder  And it hit me  No it couldn't be  And I looked down at the hot dog 
[01:24:00]  And there was a face on him  Eyes, nose, a mouth  We know what a face is  I had to get ketchup  To where it looked like his hair  And he started telling me  That I couldn't eat him  And he had a wife  And seven kids at home  To support  I can't hear the dialogue  Because of the music  What?  I can't hear the dialogue  Because of the music  I know the awful music  It like drowns it out 
[01:24:30]  Well she looked down  At the hot dog dog  And it looked like a face  And then the face is talking  Saying it has seven kids at home  Yeah it looked like  A Duke lacrosse player  On a penis  I get it  I get it  Had a face  A nose and mouth  Eyes  The ketchup looked like hair  Yeah the ketchup looked like hair  I think the message is  I must feel like a whore  For putting out  Because otherwise  If I just  Give it to my natural sexual urge 
[01:25:00]  Then a guy won't have to work  60 hours  Put in overtime  To get a spoiler  For his Honda  That might attract me  To maybe  Giving him oral gratification  In the toilet  Is this what you're getting  From this?  Wow  Nice buzz  I think the hot dog  Is some kind of  You know  Thing there  The hot dog  But the point is  Yeah  Drugs  Any drug that  Makes you not produce  Is against the law  Any drug that will 
[01:25:30]  Keep you dumb and happy  In a 60 hour a week cubicle  Yeah that's legal  Alright let's get back  To the story here  Alright  And he had a wife  And seven kids at home  To support  And I stood there  With his hot dog  And asked Terry  Do you know  This hot dog  Is talking to me  And he says  Nah let's get out of here  He thought I was just faking  Thanks for the help  And I told him  Look at the thing  He's got a face  And he's screaming  And the guy  Finally looked over 
[01:26:00]  And he got on  The same trip  That I was on  Look at the  You know something  This bitch  Just screwed up  The other guy's  Good trip  Poor Terry  Poor Terry  Is just hanging out  He's having a good time  He has to battle  Having a girl's name  To begin with  Just wants to get high  And enjoy himself  Have a little ass  Enjoy the time  Maybe get lucky  With this whore  Later on  It's a 60's  Free love  He's tripping  With a hot piece  Yeah he's gonna be  Getting some  She brings up  A talking hot dog  He's like  Nah it's nothing  Meaning 
[01:26:30]  Bitch  Shut up  Leave this alone  Don't think about it  Don't go there  She brings it up again  He looks  Oh Christ  It does have a face  Now he ruins his trip  Maybe  Killjoy  Maybe it was his hot dog  Maybe  Yeah  He's not talking  Just put it in your mouth  Maybe it's his first trip  And he doesn't know  He doesn't know  Well enough  To leave her behind  To go walk around  The neighborhood  Yeah just leave her alone  Man  Yeah  And the hot dog  Had one eye  And it was looking at me  Intensely  If you're having bad trips  That's for rookies 
[01:27:00]  To deal with  That's why you have  That's why you have youngsters  Like butters  Hanging around  Drop her off at the hospital  And just leave  Yeah well it gets better  So uh  Go I'm waiting  Terry has acknowledged  The face on the hot dog  Yeah Terry now  Is starting to get into  The same bad trip  That this uh  Broad is in  It's like having free XM  I love it  Here we go  He got on the same trip  That I was on  And we sat there  Carrying on a conversation  With that hot dog  Finally I decided 
[01:27:30]  I was just hallucinating  So I put it in my mouth  And bit down  It screamed so loud  That's Terry screaming  I see this a whole different way  They never left  They never left the apartment  They never left the apartment  And that's Terry screaming  His ass off  She was tripping  That they bought a hot dog  He drew a face on it  Yeah just to be silly  Because they're tripping  Oh this should be fun 
[01:28:00]  Some broad  Terry was driving  And that scream  Was the tires screeching  The guy I'm tripping with  Is kind of a new friend of mine  And we're down in a small town  On the Arizona border  So he doesn't understand  That I'm hearing  And then I put it into my mouth  And then I start yanking off  And he's like  I thought you were on the radio  And you go  Just I'll explain later  Bear with me  Yeah bear with me  Jesus  Alright so I backed it up 
[01:28:30]  A little bit  Here we go again  I decided I was just hallucinating  So I put it in my mouth  And bit down  It screamed so loud  That you could hear it  All over town  So I had to throw it  On the ground  And step on it  Poor guy  She's using the  Opie mouse technique  It's the same thing  Lorena Bobbitt said  Why would you have to step on it  Why not just put it down  Safely and gently  Because it was 
[01:29:00]  It was suffering  Like Opie's mice  In the glue trap  This is a monster now  You gotta put it down  And you gotta kill it  Right  That's probably  That's probably just a drug  Biting it  Yeah  And stomping  Stomping  Thinking of all its children  Poor Terry  He's just in San Francisco  The heyday of the hippies  Yeah  He's just trying to get some action  Got some chicken capris  And a smart outfit  Summer of love  With some dope  Some dope  That's just  Destroying his manhood  I don't believe  It's a hot dog anymore  She's got a nice  Unconditioned braid 
[01:29:30]  In her hair  Yeah  Hairy armpits  Dirty feet  Yeah  How did they play this thing  Was this like  In front of every good movie  That you had to sit  Nah  This kind of thing  Used to play in schools  They would like  Get an assembly together  In school  And play this  Along with  You know  Hamburger on the highway  That movie about driving  In driver's ed  I remember honestly  In I guess it was  Sixth grade  A science teacher  Telling us  That kids who would  Sniff glue  Would die 
[01:30:00]  And be so deformed  That their parents  Couldn't pick out  Their bodies  In the morgue  Sounds cool  I never thought about  Sniffing glue  But it occurred to me  Later on  Wait  They were teaching me  This in public school  Such disinformation  That it destroys  Like there's  Yeah there's drugs  That are bad  But once a kid  Learns that  Hey if I smoke  A joint  I'm probably not  Going to blow  My friend's head off 
[01:30:30]  Yeah I was always  Smoking a joint  And you would  If you were the babysitter  Let's say you're babysitting  And you smoke a little reefer  You would put the baby  In the oven  And the mother  Would come home  And find the turkey  Upstairs  Tucked in  Into the crib  That was always  Like the story  And she'd go to check  On her baby  And go  Where's my  Why is there  Why is there  A turkey in the crib  And run downstairs  And the babysitter  Would go  No the turkey's  In the oven  And the mother  Would open the oven  And scream  Because her baby 
[01:31:00]  Was cooked in the oven  Because the babysitter  Smoked a joint  But the thing is  Once kids realize  That one of those  That is terrific  Am I there?  Yeah  Yeah you're there  Once kids realize  That one of those  Things is garbage  They discount all of it  And they go  Well I guess heroin  Must be just as easy  A spot  Like if you're  Going to have PSAs  Make them honest  Yeah  Alright let's get  To the end of the story  Here we got 40 more seconds  I'm waiting  I'm all nice  There's a great ending here 
[01:31:30]  So loud  That you could hear  It all over town  So I had to throw it  On the ground  And step on it  And I was jumping  On this hot dog  In the middle of Market Street  I realized that I had murdered it  And I took off screaming 
[01:32:00]  Down the street  Scared  Alright running  She ran down the street  Just scared  Nothing makes me want to slap a woman  More than when they scream like that  Because she murdered a hot dog  Wait wait  Is this video of this  Or this is  Yeah there is a video  Yeah you see it  You're going to have to tell me  How this PSA ends  Because I can only  The sound effects  Are screaming over the dialogue  Yeah I saw the video  Or a piece of it 
[01:32:30]  Just recently  It was on something  I think maybe the Daily Show  Was playing  Or a Cold Bear Rapport  Was playing like a piece of it  And yeah there's a video  It's all groovy  And done with like  Those light shows  That used to be done  With oil paint  And the overhead projector  Kind of thing like that  Was going on in between  Like an old Black Sabbath video  Yeah something like that  Exactly  Kaleidoscope things going on  Wow wow  And Doug I'll tell you  How this ended  With Terry in the emergency room  Going why did she do that to me  Why

Weakens our resistance  Dude  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit 
[02:26:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children  Jackass  I can't believe it  It's a pedophile humor  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous  It's awful  A bunch of idiots  Perversion for profit  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program  The Opie and Anthony  God that irritates me  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us 
[02:27:00]  Opie  I want my coffee  Anthony  I want that fact  Jim Norton  I want Ozzy  We are going to dumb this thing down  To the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children  It's terrible  The Opie and Anthony show  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  guitar solo  and dance  We'll be right back on the road 
[02:27:30]  And we'll be right back on the road  And we'll be right back on the road  At the Wolves  And we'll be right back on the road  mixture  me  như  Not iste  Let him wait. 
[02:28:00]  Ah!  We've got to remind people we're going to be on David Letterman August 31st.  That's right.  We're very excited about that.  We've got to create a buzz.  We're going to be on David Letterman August 31st, Bob Kelly.  That's huge.  How insane is that?  Yeah, we're very, very excited about that.  That's great, man.  Extremely excited.  Who's going to sit in the first seat, you or Anthony? 
[02:28:30]  Uh, I don't know.  We've got to flip a Kern.  A Kern?  Give me back my Kern.  That's great, dude.  Good for you.  We're trying to, like, get the whole audience to be Opie and Anthony fans.  Yeah, we want pests in the audience.  Then it would be very, very easy to do.  That'd be actually cool to do something with the pests.  See, like, our fans, watch what they do and have them do stuff that, you know, on the radio show.  It'd be crazy.  Better.  Ridiculous.  All right.  Wow, lots of dumps.  Thanks to Doug Stanhope. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, right.  Lots and lots of dumps.  Let's see.  Oh, look at that.  Push that mic down.  I don't know what's going on with that microphone over there.  Eh.  Uh, that one?  It just echoes around the room or something.  Yeah, it's got to be turned off unless somebody's sitting there or else, yeah, it echoes.  All right.  That was a good walkover today, too.  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  Good.  Good.  I like lots of dumps.  Seven dumpies.  Lots of dumps are very healthy for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, it's fun to see if we can do, like, a friendly show, but the reality is we need  some dumps.  We need some good old dumps.  I did not say this is like the SNL fuck.  No, it doesn't even make sense.  I was trying to say something else, maybe, and he panicked.  Uh, all right.  You want to do the dumps real fast and then we'll move on?  Move on?  Yeah, dump, uh, let's go to the dump sheet.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:30:00]  Uh, here we go.  And, uh, Doug Stanhope getting quite a few today.  7, 10 a.m., Norton gets peed on.  They don't like that.  Don't like anything about urinating on people.  Yeah.  You can talk about urination.  You can even piss on yourself.  You can't say piss.  You can say peed on yourself.  Your mic stinks today.  My mic is, it's because, is this one on?  I don't know what the problem is.  Is that mic on?  Watch what happens.  Ready?  Talk.  Okay, now it's fine.  Perfect.  Whose mic are you turning on and off?  All right, that goes.  Bob Kelly's mic stinks.  Yeah, that one picks up everything. 
[02:30:30]  And we've been having this problem for a while.  They've got to figure it out.  It makes it kind of echoey.  It's taking, uh, the room noise and, uh, it's a whole thing.  It's not set for, um, it's not set for, uh, Omni.  All right, let's go.  Uh, Omni.  Thank God for XM because, uh, regular radio doesn't like Norton gets peed on.  Yeah.  At 7.13 a.m., she's on fucking.  And then, uh, I guess he held himself, but, uh, the fucking got out.  Doug Stanhope on the phone, of course.  Um, and 7.21 a.m., shut the fuck. 
[02:31:00]  And then he stopped himself again.  He stops himself right after he says the curse.  Wow, he's tripping.  Yeah, Doug Stanhope on the phone.  And at 7.54, I start yanking off.  Doug Stanhope on the phone, talking about jerking off.  Uh, 8.26 a.m.  This is like the SNL fuck.  That's not what it...  You didn't say that.  Opie tried to stop himself, but it was too close.  I'd love to know what you were trying to say there.  I'd love to listen to the replay.  I had a mumbling mess this morning, but I think I was just trying to say this is like the SNL bit. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Or the SNL Jeopardy bit.  Or the SNL fucking bit.  Maybe, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe I did do that.  At 8.40 a.m., Bob Kelly, sorry I fucked it up.  That's what you said, Bob.  You said it just like that, too, didn't you?  Yes, you did.  At 8.50, a contestant after he had his arm hair waxed with a mousetrap, uttered,  Oh, shit.  Of course he did.  That looked very painful.  And that's it.  Seven. 
[02:32:00]  Bad.  We gotta do better next time.  Not bad.  We'll go for ten tomorrow.  So, let's say hi to Dan in Pennsylvania.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, I heard Stern the other day saying that he could put the X&A on your appearance on Letterman if he wanted to.  Go ahead.  But he didn't care.  Go ahead.  Yeah, someone call up Howard and tell him if, uh, tell him Opie and Anthony said to do it.  Go ahead.  Because, uh, the truth of the matter is, there's no truth to that matter.  It just ain't, uh, it ain't gonna happen. 
[02:32:30]  What kind of juice does he think he's got as far as pulling CBS programming?  Look, to be on Letterman is really, really cool, but we don't need it for the radio show.  So, if he can stop that, then stop it, Howard.  Go ahead.  We challenge you.  Let's see how powerful you really are.  Direct challenge.  Because he says this shit all the time.  So, the ONA passed.  Get a hold of Howard.  He's still on the radio.  And give him a message.  Opie and Anthony say, stop our Letterman appearance. 
[02:33:00]  Let's see what you can do.  He said, uh, he, if he put his foot down, he could have us taken off that show.  But, uh, he, he wouldn't do it.  No, we're telling you to do it.  We're asking you.  Go ahead.  Yeah, let's see what you're really about, Howard.  Let me see.  Because, like Opie said, he always puts this shit out there, and then there's zero accountability to it.  This, that, the other thing.  Oh, I could do this.  I could do that.  I was up for this.  I did that.  Well, you say you could pull it.  You have people over there at, uh, at the Letterman show. 
[02:33:30]  Go ahead.  Do it.  We dare you.  Do it.  We dare you.  Dare you.  We dare you.  One other question.  Uh, Ron and Fez are going to be appearing at the, uh, comedy tour?  Well, uh, we'd love to have him at the PNC show, especially.  Yeah.  It's a nice, uh, short drive for those guys.  Yeah, we'd love to have him.  More than cordially invited to, uh, come with us and, uh, enjoy any festivities backstage.  Yeah, we'll give him the personal invite today. 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  Thanks.  Here's the actual audio.  Uh, oh.  Well, Howard had a bunch of things to say about us the other day.  There was almost, I think it was the closest he's ever, ever come to giving this show a compliment.  I think he slipped.  I think he slipped here.  He slipped in and he was really mad at himself.  It was really the closest I've ever heard him come to giving this show even, even something 
[02:34:30]  close to a compliment.  Yeah.  Here we go.  This is about us, uh, going to Chicago.  Going to Chicago.  Taking over for Rover.  Right.  Arnie, you're on the air in Chicago.  You know, uh, Rover's done in Chicago, too.  Hmm.  Well, um, what do you call it?  Uh, they got, uh, Opie and Anthony, Rover, and, um, Adam Carolla, and I don't know who  else.  Well, yeah, they're replacing, um, Rover with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they seem to be going with because, you know, those guys at least.  Right, yeah. 
[02:35:00]  Right, yeah.  Right, yeah.  Right, yeah.  Now, hold on.  You guys are.  She's the worst.  Oh, yeah.  If you isolate what she does on a daily basis, you'd be amazed.  Well, the more money she gets, the more English she becomes.  Oh, Howard.  She's a nut in it for saying such things as, right, yeah.  Is that right, Howard?  Right, yeah.  Right, yeah.  Well.  Well.  Oh, Howard. 
[02:35:30]  Right, yeah.  Anthony show.  Yeah, well, that's what they seem to be going with because, you know.  Right, yeah.  Right, yeah.  Yeah, listen to the whole, and then, because it's right after that comes the closest thing  you'll ever hear to a compliment.  Sure.  Yeah, well, that's what they seem to be going with because, you know, those guys at least  had a radio show that worked.  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[02:36:00]  Whoa, hold on.  Whoa.  Whoa, you can't step on the brakes like that.  Cars plow into the back of you.  You think he was kicking himself like, ah, shit, I said it.  A show that works.  God damn it.  I meant a show that copies me and sucks, and it came out a show that works.  Hoo-hoo.  At least they have a show that works at sucking.  A show that works at sucking, Robin.  Fuck, I slipped. 
[02:36:30]  Ooh.  Yeah, that's, I mean, I've never heard him even remotely.  Any time he's brought us up, it's been nothing but a bash fest.  All right, get a message to Howard.  Two things now.  Two things.  I dare you to get us kicked off our Letterman appearance.  August 31st.  And also thank him for the compliments.  Yeah, and thank you for the compliment.  That is kind of nice.  That our show is great.  That we have the best show on radio.  Any show.  Yeah, well, that's what they seem to be going with because, you know, those guys at least 
[02:37:00]  had a radio show that worked.  I don't know.  I see them rolling into more and more markets.  It's funny because when we left, the plan was not to give all of our stations to one  person because they were afraid, again, of somebody having too much power in the company.  But, I don't know, that seems to have gone out the window.  Damn right it did.  We will have the power.  The power.  They're falling right into our trap.  Mwahaha. 
[02:37:30]  Mwahaha.  We will get the stations.  Then we get the power.  Then you'll get the woman.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's cocaine dealing.  Sorry.  I was talking about radio.  He's going to put out his tongue like a lizard to Fareed.  Come back, Howard.  Come on.  Give him a quailude.  He'll love me in the morning.  All right.  This guy, of course.  We have to have one of these today.  Your studio is so polluted.  You can't even do anything funny.  Yes, Chris. 
[02:38:00]  Hello.  Yeah, Chris.  Hi.  Yeah.  Chris.  Who's this?  What do you want to say, Chris?  Chris, you're on the radio.  You're on the air, Chris.  You know, bash us.  You're past the screeners.  Let's go.  You're on the air live.  You're with Opie, Anthony, Jimmy.  Now, let her rip.  Yeah, I'm with all of you.  And I want to say, you guys sit there and you bash Howard all day.  But you're doing the same thing that he did to you with the gag order.  You faggot.  What gag order?  Wait, wait, wait.  Don't, don't, now, because we hate when people like you hang up or don't let a discussion 
[02:38:30]  happen.  Let's talk about this.  Let's address the first thing.  What?  Hold on, hold on.  Let's address the first thing, Chris.  Let's break it down.  Do we talk about Howard all day long?  You guys definitely bash Howard on a daily basis.  No, we haven't.  This is the first time we've mentioned Howard this week, by the way.  Not on a daily basis.  We mention it when it's in.  You would keep counting, you faggot.  Hey, wait a minute, Chris.  Chris, Chris.  Am I getting to you, Chris?  Am I getting to you?  It's when it's in the news or when it involves us directly.  See, you're not open to a discussion. 
[02:39:00]  You're not discussing things.  What gag order, dude?  Listen, Chris.  I hate this.  This is the first time we're talking about Howard this week.  The reason is because Howard had some things to say about us on his show, so we're responding,  you douche.  So don't you understand that?  No, listen to me.  What gag order, dude?  Go ahead.  What gag order?  Go ahead.  No, you guys might as well put a gag order on everybody because you're ruining everybody's  ratings in every city that you go in.  What the fuck is that about?  How do we ruin everyone's ratings?  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  How do we ruin? 
[02:39:30]  You have Pess call their show up, which is not fair.  You have them call up and-  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  This guy's a fan and loves us.  All right, Chris.  You got us.  Chris, you're a fan.  Dude, you're a fan and you like the show.  Shut up.  Jimmy, I love you.  Thank you.  I knew it.  I knew it.  Chris.  Because he was too-  He had me right up until he said, you ruin other people's ratings and the Pess, and it  was too inside.  God, I hate that.  I wanted a little fight.  You had me until you said ruin. 
[02:40:00]  Ruin.  Ruin.  Ruin.  He needs to be corrected.  You brought Ruin Nation down.  All right, let's go to Greg in Jersey.  Greg.  Hey, guys.  I don't know what Howard's getting at, but he did say that ONA had a great show.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, you mean he-  Yeah, I don't know.  Not had.  Let me hear it in context.  All right.  And I want to hear the whole again.  It's just hysterical.  Oh, so maybe had. 
[02:40:30]  Open Anthony Shaw.  Yeah, well, that's what they seem to be going with, because-  Right, yeah.  You know, those guys at least had a radio show that worked.  I don't know.  I see them rolling into more and more markets.  So it's still a-  Had a radio show that worked, so they picked us up.  Like, like, like if you have a good, I don't know.  You had a radio show that worked on Free FM.  Yeah.  That's what they say.  You had something that worked on Free FM, so let's- 
[02:41:00]  You know what?  They worked before, they're going to work again.  Ah, so it's still a compliment.  Right.  It's still a compliment.  And she gave you a compliment.  I can see them rolling, getting more jobs.  Getting more, but it's-  Yeah, rolling into more markets.  No.  We walk into markets.  You roll into any way you fucking go, you fat hoppity hop.  Oh, big round woman.  Rolling into more and more markets.  Yeah, it's funny because when we left, the plan was not to give all of our stations to one person 
[02:41:30]  because they were afraid, again, of somebody having too much power in the company.  But, I don't know, that seems to have gone out the window.  They've lost about 100 million bucks in advertising dollars since I left.  So they're going to go with something that attracts an audience.  Oh, there you go.  We attracted an audience.  Hey, we attracted an audience.  He's getting soft.  He's getting soft in his old days.  God damn.  Enough of this ass kissing, Howard.  Too many bikini teenies in the Hamptons, I think.  Jeez. 
[02:42:00]  All right, well, here's the clip that the guy brought to our attention.  Ross told me over the weekend that Opie and Anthony were going to be on Letterman at the end of August.  Oh, really?  And he asked me how I felt.  Oh, really?  She is the biggest phony.  What is that?  She knows damn well that we're going to be on Letterman.  Got to make believe you're just finding out, huh?  You're not like everybody else on radio where you're studying the landscape and seeing what this guy's doing and that guy's doing.  I hear they're going to be on Letterman.  No, really?  Oh, really?  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:30]  Says it's not so.  Come on, it's Waffithin.  Ross told me over the weekend that Opie and Anthony were going to be on Letterman at the end of August.  Oh, really?  And he asked me how I felt about it.  I said, who gives a shit?  And he said, really?  I said, yeah, I could have stopped that.  Letterman called me about it.  All right, listen, Howard.  If you could stop it, I beg you.  Yeah, go ahead.  We give you the challenge.  I dare you to stop it.  Not a joke.  I dare you.  Not a bit.  Not anything.  Really stop it. 
[02:43:00]  Go ahead.  Cut to Friday.  Damn.  Billboard.  We're off.  Billboard Monitor is interviewing us today.  Yep.  A direct quote.  We dare hire him.  To stop our Letterman appearance.  Let's see how powerful he is.  We dare you, Howard.  Because he cranks bullshit out like that all the time and never has to answer for it.  Call the post.  No?  Call everybody.  Call everybody.  Sue everyone.  Right.  Now, you know, it's interesting.  I've kind of dissected this clip. 
[02:43:30]  Listen to how many different sources he heard that we were going to be on Letterman from.  It starts out with he got a call from Letterman.  Like, his whole fucking story falls apart.  Listen to how many different people told him that we were going to be on Letterman.  All right, get David Hinckley on the phone, too.  Can you?  Sure.  Everybody.  We're giving quotes to the press today.  Get old corpse hand on the phone.  Get Linda Stassi on the phone.  That's right.  Tell her to stop brushing her mullet with a black cock and take that cadaver hand off  her fat cunt of a face and get on the damn horn. 
[02:44:00]  That's right.  Oh, like a face fucker.  I like to put on a monkey suit and give her a good face fucking awful post critic.  We're accepting all interviews today.  That twat.  Let's take to a Colorado hotel room with a pig mask on.  And I'll even do monkey sounds as I'm face fucking.  I'll go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, good monkey sound.  As I pump into her stupid, unwilling mouth.  Wait.  Get, uh, Richard Huff.  He writes TV, and this is a TV issue. 
[02:44:30]  We'll just sit here and wait for our interviews.  We're waiting.  We have a lot to say to the press today.  Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?  Hello?  We'll wait.  We got time.  We got plenty of time.  We got until at least 11.  We'll just sit here and wait.  We got plenty to say today.  This is great iced tea.  Hey.  Thanks.  Well, Billboard, come in here.  I want to see what your quote is.  I want to make sure you got the quote right. 
[02:45:00]  Is this all right?  Oh, look at Kenny.  Is this all right?  Thank you, Kenny.  I look hoshy.  It looks like a cup of soup.  Thank you.  Mike, right?  Right.  Hey, damn, Mike.  Do you want me to read it back to you?  Yeah, Mike is doing an interview with us today for Billboard Minor, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Altonographer, can we please have that read back?  What have you observed today so far?  Anything interesting?  You just guys have a lot of fun.  That's all.  The whole thing is just a blast.  Okay.  Howard, I could have stopped Letterman's appearance. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  Opie said, we dare him.  We dare him.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  What the fuck did I say?  What did you say?  I said, this guy, Howard, Howard, write it down, Howard, pulls shit like this constantly  with no accountability.  Pulls shit like this constantly.  Hey, wait.  You're getting a better quote than me.  I know.  Shut up.  No.  No accountability.  How do you spell accountability?  I have no idea.  I'm sorry.  And if it wasn't for myspace.com slash Jim Norton.  Shut up.  I'm not done with my quote.  With no accountability, we'll get to Jimmy next. 
[02:46:00]  Jimmy needs a quote, too.  We are begging him.  That's right.  To stop this Letterman appearance.  Can you go back to me?  Yeah.  Opie says, bring it on, fuck face.  Bring it on.  Fuck face.  Is that one or two words?  Fuck face.  All right.  Make sure you go to the stress factory.  No, no, no.  All right.  Write this down.  Are you a Jew?  Jesus.  Jesus.  I want to Mel Gibson got press.  I'm trying here.  Yeah.  Get us some freaking tequila. 
[02:46:30]  We got things to say.  I want to drink, drive, and bash the Jews.  Jimmy, your quote?  Billboard minor.  Here we go.  I'm trying to eat healthier.  It's working.  Complete ass.  We basically tell Howard today, let's see what you got.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Stop talking a good game, and let's see if you can get it done.  If you got on your show and said you could pull us off a Letterman, do it.  Do it.  What if he does it?  All right.  What if he does it? 
[02:47:00]  He's going to suck.  Can't do it.  If he does it, then he is truly great.  You know what?  That's the beauty of us, though.  If he does, we look like complete assholes.  I was looking forward to seeing you on the Letterman show.  But if we're willing to put ourselves out there.  It's worth the shot.  Let's see what he's got.  Because we're so sick of his shit.  We're all in.  We're all in.  Here you go, buddy.  We're going all in, my friend.  You calling or you folding, fucker?  Here you go.  You calling or you folding?  What do you got?  The World Series of Assholes.  That's right. 
[02:47:30]  Right here.  And we're all in.  I got a 2-8 offsuit.  What do you got?  See, I don't gamble like you guys.  I say things like, I dare you to send a chick with a dick to my apartment prepaid.  What do you got?  All right.  All right.  We're ready for our next interview.  Let's go to the phone.  Who wants to talk to us next?  What do we got?  What do we got?  Left messages for Hinkley and Huff.  Great.  Oh, great.  We have a lot to say finally.  And no one wants to talk to us. 
[02:48:00]  That's right.  Not David.  John.  By the way, we're not bullshitting.  We're not bullshitting.  Own a pest.  Get on it.  Tell Minnelli and Hinkley and the press what we just said.  We want the word out so he knows.  Go ahead.  Do it.  Go ahead.  Do it.  You got the power.  Do it.  Do it.  We're all in.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  My friend.  Or don't.  Or think about it.  I want to hear the rest of that quote.  All right.  Let's go.  I felt about it.  I said, who gives a shit? 
[02:48:30]  And he said, really?  I said, yeah, I could have stopped that.  Letterman called me about three weeks ago.  Letterman called me three weeks ago.  The Letterman people called my agent.  Letterman people called his agent.  They were getting a lot of pressure by a certain person over at CBS to put Opie and Anthony on the Letterman show.  So this wasn't a Dave idea.  No.  Dave's not necessarily a fan.  Or maybe he is.  I don't know.  Cover yourself.  They weren't into it.  They said they were receiving a lot of pressure.  But if I put my foot down, they wouldn't do it.  So I said, I'm not going to do that.  I don't care.  Anybody who wants to go on Letterman. 
[02:49:00]  Letterman is not my show.  And I don't control the Letterman show.  I'm not looking to control the Letterman show.  Put on whoever you want.  They said, well, will you stop doing it then?  I go, no.  I'm not going to stop.  I mean, you've had other disc jockeys on the Letterman show.  Go have whoever you want.  You've had Imus.  You've had Mad Dog Russo.  Mad Dog and Russo show.  Oh, really?  How do you lose that?  I don't know.  That's what Gary told me.  Christopher Russo.  Mikey, the son of a bitch can't even get our fucking show space.  Don't concern yourself with me.  I really don't care.  But, Howard, you said you could stop it. 
[02:49:30]  Enough of your talk.  Enough.  Yeah.  Do it.  Put your foot down like you said.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  We call you out.  We are all in.  We're all in.  Are you?  Fold or call it.  Are you in?  Are you?  No.  All right.  Give me an interviewer.  Next one.  Come on.  All right.  Here it comes.  Any minute now, the phones are just going to ring off the hook. 
[02:50:00]  Let's go to Mr. H.  Oh, we got Richard Huff.  Hey.  All right.  Richard.  Richard Huff.  Hey there.  How are you?  Loved your piece on Jody Applegate, by the way.  Thank you very much.  That was very good.  We had the guys on our show two days ago or yesterday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess I just missed you that day.  I had heard about it and I actually got an email from one of the brothers about the performance.  But that was a great TV moment, as we've talked about before.  Yeah.  One of those live news moments where she just lost her mind. 
[02:50:30]  Well, you know, as I pointed out in my piece, it wasn't just losing her mind over that incident.  It was the whole thing leading up to it.  And she'll do anything to get attention and all of a sudden somebody pulled a joke on her and, oh, the kids.  The kids are listening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The kids.  And then that whole conversation about the four-year-old that watches the news every morning.  Yeah.  No, no.  They're not watching the news.  All right.  Absolutely.  Here's the deal.  Richard, we're going to explain in a second.  But, Steve, what are you going to do for us today? 
[02:51:00]  We're going to get the smoking gun on the phone for you.  All right.  Smoking gun on the phone.  We want the audio from the show today.  They could throw it on their website.  Sure.  We want e-entertainment news involved with the Daily Ten.  We want David Hinckley.  Of course.  We want, well, page six from the Post.  They hate us.  They don't like us.  We'll give it a try anyway.  Okay.  We're calling Howard out today, Mr. Huff.  We're calling him out.  Yes.  Did you know, Mr. Huff?  Type away.  Type away.  I want to hear typing.  I want to hear typing. 
[02:51:30]  Old style.  Are you writing or typing?  Hold on.  Let me run down the hall and get the old typewriter we use as a paperweight.  Paperweight.  That's what I want to hear.  We want you to take us very seriously today.  Who are you?  Mickey Spillane.  Richard Huff.  Take you seriously?  Yeah.  Well, here's the deal.  Did you know that Opie and Anthony are going to be on David Letterman August 31st?  I did not know that.  Yes.  Now you know.  Oh, I'm hearing keys, my friend.  Is that what you're looking for, keys? 
[02:52:00]  That's what we're looking for.  Imagine it just says YYZ HD.  Hyping.  Like Jack Nicholson.  All work and no play.  That's Richard a dull boy.  How do you like it?  And wait for Jim Norton's quote as well, okay, Richard?  That's right.  It's important.  So, you know what?  You know what?  I'm going to make it so easy for you.  You've already got them written out for me, though, right?  Huh?  You've already got the quotes written out.  You're just going to give me, right?  Yes.  Here's the deal.  Listen to this.  So, we're going to be on Letterman August 31st, okay? 
[02:52:30]  We're very excited.  This is like a dream come true.  We grew up on Long Island.  We're beside ourselves.  Have you ever been on with him before?  No.  Never been on.  You know that we went 120 miles an hour into a brick wall with our radio careers a few years back.  I've heard about that.  And, yeah, it's been in the news a couple of times.  We have built our careers back up now.  We're at the point where we're getting markets added all the time, new markets on Terrestrial.  We're doing great here on XM Satellite Radio.  And now we're getting shows like David Letterman. 
[02:53:00]  And importantly, though, you might not want to write that Obie said, we're beside ourselves.  You might want to have a cooler quote.  That's kind of Southern 1910.  The man was looking at me.  Yeah.  Someone pinch me.  When did you guys find out you were going on?  We found out a couple of weeks ago.  A couple of weeks ago that we are going to be on the David Letterman show.  We've been keeping it on the down low.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Like Norton's sexuality.  Oh, well, excuse me.  So.  Excuse me.  Hold on.  So now.  If I haven't told you enough already, then you need to go to detective school.  We still have a couple questions.  I'll be happy to answer anything you want.  Dress equals okay.  You guys really need filler for today's show.  No, no, not at all.  No, this is very important.  Wait until we get to the actual meat of this.  Okay.  So we're, yeah, extremely excited, okay?  Howard had this to say about our Letterman appearance. 
[02:54:00]  Are you ready to listen and jot?  I'm ready.  All right.  Get ready to jot.  Ross told me over the weekend that Opie and Anthony were going to be on Letterman at the  end of August.  Oh, really?  And he asked me how I felt about it.  I said, who gives a shit?  And he said, really?  I said, yeah, I could have stopped that.  Letterman called me about three weeks ago.  The Letterman people called my agent and said they were getting a lot of pressure by a certain  person over at CBS to put Opie and Anthony on the Letterman show.  So this wasn't a Dave idea? 
[02:54:30]  No.  Dave's not necessarily a fan, or maybe he is.  I don't know.  But they weren't into it.  They said they were receiving a lot of pressure.  But if I put my foot down, they wouldn't do it.  So I said, I'm not going to do that.  I don't care.  Anybody who wants to go on Letterman, Letterman is not my show, and I don't control the Letterman  show.  And I'm not looking to control the Letterman show.  Put on whoever you want.  They said, well, will you stop doing it then?  I go, no, I'm not going to stop.  I mean, you've had other disc jockeys on the Letterman show.  Go have whoever you want.  You've had Imus.  You've had Mad Dog Russo.  Mad Dog and Russo show.  Oh, really? 
[02:55:00]  I don't know.  That's the one.  Gary told me that.  Christopher Russo.  Oh, Christopher Russo.  I said, have whoever you want on.  Don't concern yourself with me.  I really don't care.  All right.  You heard that, right?  I heard that.  Okay.  Here comes the whole meat of this whole thing.  Richard, you play poker, right?  No.  Oh, wow.  You don't play...  No Texas Hold'em in your life?  You want to hang up now?  No.  No.  Here's the deal.  We're going all in, Richard.  Howard does this all the time. 
[02:55:30]  He says things that can never be confirmed.  There's no accountability to it.  We are telling Howard right now, go ahead.  We are begging him.  Put his foot down.  If he could get us taken off a Letterman, do it.  Because we truly believe this is just more bullshit out of his mouth.  Go ahead.  Get us off a Letterman.  Do it.  Do it.  I beg of you, you lying sack.  Opie and Anthony dare you.  To get us thrown off a Letterman. 
[02:56:00]  We dare you.  We're all in.  We're all in.  And you watch what doesn't happen.  Because he's so full of crap.  He thinks he has power over CBS and over David Letterman to have us taken off the show at his whim.  His listeners need to know that he's just full of shit.  We're calling him out.  We're willing to blow up our whole Letterman, you know, spot here.  Putting it all on the line.  We're putting it all on the line.  If there's this million to one shot that he actually can do this, then we lose. 
[02:56:30]  But the truth of the matter is, it's more of his just self-important drivel.  And this idiot can go ahead, call his people that he knows over there, and make it so we aren't on the show.  We're begging him to do it because we know it's a bunch of crap.  That's what we do today.  Everyone's giving quotes.  Oh, Jim Norton's got a quote.  Jim Norton, big quote.  He usually wraps up the whole thing nicely for us.  In a nice package.  I like eating bananas because they remind me of dicks. 
[02:57:00]  Oh yeah, that can get in the paper.  I'm sorry, Richard.  We thought he was going to wrap it up in a nice package.  That package is in his mouth.  You need to work on that presentation just a little bit for the media.  Yeah, he doesn't know how to maybe tame it down a couple of notches.  Just a little bit.  I got one.  All right, Richard, Jim Norton again.  Aussie rules.  Do you have a question for us now? 
[02:57:30]  Well, I mean, have you talked to the Letterman folks about this?  No.  Maybe as a reporter that's your job.  I don't know.  Well, but, I mean, when did Howard say this?  I think two days ago.  We finally got to it because we actually do a radio show.  So, you know, we finally got to it.  We had a lot of other things to do before this.  It was earlier in the week, let's say.  So you haven't called up the Letterman folks and said, is there anything behind this?  No.  We just know there isn't.  We're not investigative reporters. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, we're just Mr. Huff.  We're just shock chocks.  Yeah.  We're too smart to do stuff like that.  We're too busy.  Yeah, but have any of the Letterman folks reached out to you?  No.  Let me think.  No.  But they haven't not reached out to us.  I had a boy or something to that.  But, you know, Richard, it's like my favorite expression.  Yes.  Que sera sera. 
[02:58:30]  Whatever will be, will be.  That's a nice quote.  Of course it is.  I don't need a good quote.  I can't pull it out.  All we are is dust in the wind.  Is Huff a Jew named?  Thank you.  Sorry.  I see how much press he's getting, and we're really trying here.  See, we're not thinking that this is going to make the paper, so we're going to get a little more outrageous.  So we've got to get outrageous.  I want you to know I'm drunk right now, and I'm driving.  Well, I'm Jim Norton.  I don't attack the Jews.  I go after the tough Hollywood targets.  I say things like, are you Haitian?  Haitians start all the wars in the world. 
[02:59:00]  See, because they can't hurt you.  You're out on a limb.  We like making fun of the deaf.  Now, I would suspect that your rivals suggest this is just nothing but a publicity play.  No, this has been an ongoing thing with him.  He just talks out of his ass, and we're sick of it.  We love calling him out on things, and this is a perfect example because it will have a finish to it. 
[02:59:30]  That's right.  If we are on Letterman, then he's full of shit.  Right.  If he gets us pulled off of Letterman, then he does absolutely have that power, and he wasn't lying, and more power to him.  We'll admit defeat.  And we'll admit he actually rules.  Ah, well.  And Jim Norton will kiss his ass on network TV.  On Broadway.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Shoot me.  This is a showdown.  Don't I at least get to pick the avenue?  Yes, this is a showdown.  That's right.  This is high noon. 
[03:00:00]  High noon.  All right.  Excellent, guys.  What are the odds this actually makes the paper tomorrow, Richard?  It depends how desperate we are.  You know, if we get another Christy Brinkley picture.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, she's looking pretty.  She is pretty.  Keep your fingers crossed that they don't get a Christy Brinkley picture.  Hey, can your headlines with Christy tomorrow be,  Four Husbands-Who's-The-Common-Denominator-Whore?  Again, Jim, you've got to work just a little bit on that pitch there.  Yeah, your presentation is a little rough around the edges. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, it might work on satellite, but not in print, you know?  I'm sorry.  Richard, if you don't want this story, just pass it on to David Hinkley,  because you've got some good stuff there.  Excellent, guys.  I appreciate it.  Hey, anytime.  Thank you, Richard.  Thank you for locking up my stuff, guys.  Richard Huff.  Cool, man.  See you.  See you later.  Love Richard Huff.  He's a good boy.  Isn't it so hard to believe that we started out bashing the shit out of him  before we even knew him?  All right, is this story taking off or what?  What do we got?  What do we got?  Who's next?  AP called.  Who's next?  AP called.  Who's next?  AP. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Al Peterson.  That's right.  Jersey.  That's him.  Yeah.  What is he?  Who knows?  He doesn't even know.  Is he black and white?  All right.  A mutation.  We have one more clip here to play, I guess.  Oh, we do.  Make sure the photographer does not take a picture of me eating my blueberries.  I'm a shark jock.  It's not man.  I know it's in print.  Why?  Yeah, but...  Wear sunglasses when you do it.  It's pretty cool.  Like Tom Likas.  Tom Likas would wear sunglasses.  You know what you do?  We know you reworked this shit.  Photoshop in a pussy. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  You're just thinking of...  Yeah.  You're eating him out of a stripper's asshole.  And make that half and half instead of light milk.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  It's heavy cream.  Wow.  When he finds the bad blueberries, they're the only ones he eats.  Because he's nutty.  Wow.  That's not a spoon.  He's eating with a knife.  Yeah.  He's crazy.  All right.  Everyone get out so we can, like, perform.  Oh.  Don't throw these guys out.  They're throwing them out.  We were then thrown out of the studio.  I know.  You see his face.  And we realized the show isn't all about fun, is it? 
[03:02:00]  Wait.  Why are his headphones off?  He was like, oh, I'm not.  He went, oh, fuck.  All right.  Go fuck yourselves, right?  Go fuck yourselves.  You got to know.  What kind of people are they?  Yeah.  What?  A shock, shock, prejudice against journalists.  I had a fucking pad out.  I was writing, you fucking cocksucker.  We're writing.  That's okay.  Now go get your fucking shine box.  That's right.  Well, I'm trying to write an article right away, getting fucking fresh.  There goes the positive slam, by the way.  Yeah.  We had him for a while.  Until Opie kicked him out of the studio.  All right.  Here's the last clip from Howie today. 
[03:02:30]  Honestly, I don't give a shit about terrestrial radio and who you put on.  I do think it's weird that there are a lot of good radio performers out there on terrestrial radio who could give a good run for the, you know, even Man Cow gets some decent ratings here and there.  I'm shocked they don't, no one puts on anything opposite.  Opie and Anthony or Whoopi.  He wants us beaten so bad.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  That's what he's saying.  He's amazed that no one is putting on, putting anyone on up against us.  That's his I don't care, rally the troops statement. 
[03:03:00]  He doesn't care, but hey, people, if you're listening, there's people out there that you can put against them.  Right.  If there's such scary talent out there, by the way, how come Bubba and Pharrell are the stars of your fucking channels?  If there's such scary talent that's going to kick our ass all over the country, how come we have to be dragged in out of radio exile?  We were the scourge of the fucking business.  You were the Napoleon on Elba.  Exactly. 
[03:03:30]  Elba.  What was the island?  Is that Elba?  Yeah, it's a good crossword fucking exile clue.  That's right.  Yeah.  Elba's in a lot of crossword puzzles.  The scourge.  It really is Bob.  We were the scourge, and they had to bring us back.  If there's such scary talent out there, we would be the absolute last resort, and we were.  They did not want to bring us back.  You were the tiki.  Right.  Brought in to help Gregory surf.  Right.  Here we go.  That's bad luck.  No.  Old Mr. Hanalei.  Here's the rest of the quote. 
[03:04:00]  It is taboo.  Gibson only did a .12.  What's that?  He only did a .12.  Oh, no.  That's a faggot.  That's just racist.  I know.  No, I know that.  Yeah, I know.  He wasn't drunk enough to blurt that shit out.  But it's .8 now instead of .10.  No, I know it's .08, but .10.  It doesn't mean, because they lower the fucking number of the law doesn't mean you get less  drunk.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I know.  That was a good one.  I was actually saying that he seemed drunker on paper than he probably really was because  of that.  Yeah.  The pictures make it look like he was way above a .12.  By the way, do you know what I do to stay in shape? 
[03:04:30]  I swimwalk wherever I go.  Here we go.  There's some decent ratings here and there.  I'm shocked they don't . . . no one puts on anything opposite.  Opie and Anthony or Whoopi.  And the reality is he wants to go up against us, and he can't because of the stupid deal  that Sirius made with him.  You signed your deal.  Now sleeping.  He can't go on . . . he can't go back on free FM?  No.  Sirius ain't going to let him do that.  So he's stuck on . . .  He's stuck, and it's driving him nuts, so he can't do it, so he wants someone else to  do it.  Our vision.  He's obsessed with . . .  We had a vision at the beginning of this.  We knew we wanted to do both. 
[03:05:00]  I swear to God, he's obsessed with seeing us fail.  He wants us to fail so bad.  He wants to give it a shot.  He can't, so he's begging anyone else to take us on.  And you guys got new markets.  You're in Chicago, did you say?  San Francisco.  They're coming in all the time.  You're in Chicago and San Francisco?  San Fran, we say.  And . . .  You're in the morning on the morning.  I call it Frisco.  We're on 22 stations now.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Would we kid you?  So you should have probably talked during the first half of the show.  Yeah, Bob, because . . .  Someone would have heard you.  There's a lot of people out there listening, and nobody heard that you were there.  Yeah.  I talked.  All right.  I had some good zingers. 
[03:05:30]  He did.  All right.  Here we go.  Opie and Anthony, or Whoopi, or any of these people.  There's plenty of people that could be syndicated in terrestrial radio who do a decent job.  I don't know.  I mean, who can get ratings.  Man, I'm done with it.  I have no desire to be on interrestrial radio.  I love it here.  Oh, this is the best, man.  This is the best, and this is what I want to do to make my money.  I don't want to be on interrestrial radio.  It's not for me.  I do not want to go back to the censorship.  There is nothing more horrible than being censored. 
[03:06:00]  And it wasn't that I couldn't get ratings.  I was number one pretty much everywhere.  Yeah, ratings weren't a problem.  I can get ratings working clean, but it's nothing that interests me.  I like this.  Yeah, right.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're right.  Thanks.  You like talking to a tenth of your audience.  Sure.  Long pause.  Listen.  Let's go to Jason.  All right, what you just heard, please rewind that because you will hear him say, who cares?  Right.  Then there is a long bit of silence you will hear. 
[03:06:30]  I should have been a psychologist.  It is dead air.  Right.  This is where he is sitting there pondering what has just transpired, everything that  was said.  One gives meds, the other doesn't.  That's all I know.  All right.  Thinking about the fact that we have this great deal that we're on satellite and terrestrial  able to do both.  And you can just hear his mind going until he's got to snap himself out of it.  The long pause says a lot.  Yeah.  The rating's working clean, but it's nothing that interests me. 
[03:07:00]  I like this.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Let's go to Jason in San Diego.  That is the most telling pause ever.  You know what that was?  Him in his mind going, oh.  Get to happy place, Robin.  Happy place, happy place.  I'm taking the Howie Cop there out to the Hamptons this weekend. 
[03:07:30]  Happy place.  Happy place.  That's right.  Happy place, Howard.  There you go.  There's the challenge.  There you go.  What?  We don't give a shit in the end.  It would be great to be on Letterman, but if we lose, we lose.  Why are we?  Look at this guy.  And before you pick him up, I don't know if he's a fan of the show or not.  And before he starts babbling, I just want to preface this by saying, he says, why you  always pick on Howard.  We just played clips of him talking about us and the fact that he is able to get us removed 
[03:08:00]  from the Letterman show.  So we're responding to that, and that's picking on him, Steve?  See, let me break it down for the people out there.  There were a lot of DJs that didn't respond to Howard's bullshit, and they got destroyed  because of that.  We responded to everything.  We now respond to everything.  Everything.  We're like the Israelis.  That's why.  We wouldn't have talked about him if he never mentioned this.  We haven't talked about him in, I don't know, honestly, probably a couple weeks.  He brought it up.  Go ahead, Steve.  Yeah, what's up, guys? 
[03:08:30]  Hey, man.  What are you fucking picking on Howard for?  Didn't you notice that we were responding?  Ramon, I hope Howard gets asshole cancer of his nose.  He got me.  All right, we got it.  By the way, I got a visual gag for Letterman if you guys want it.  Oh, oh, what?  I think, because you already have a goatee, but I think you should come out with a straw  and use it as a mustache and go, hello, Dave.  Oh, like a straw mustache.  You take a regular drinking straw, put it on your upper lip like a mustache.  Well, here's the granddaddy of all visual gags, and either one of you could use this 
[03:09:00]  if you want.  I want credit for it.  Okay.  You know how you have like the pretzels that look like the arms folded?  You take a pretzel, right?  You put it over your nose so it looks like little eyeglasses, and you go, I can't see  too good no more.  Oh, maybe even pull out a second prop like a book and go, these are my reading glasses.  And then you read the book upside down, and everybody laughs.  Because it's a pretzel, not glasses, so you wouldn't even know if it was upside down  or not.  Who knows?  Who's telling you?  That is funny stuff.  Yeah.  Let's hope you can have that one.  You go to a trip as you're walking out.  Oh, hey.  Hope you can have both of those.  Let's, let's...  You guys should just make out.  How fucking hot would that be? 
[03:09:30]  Would that be great?  Hot would that be...  Just a hot kiss?  Yeah.  Like a hot B movie kiss?  But the really great part about it would be the back touching.  The kissing is awful, but the fucking...  The groping just for that fucking special place on the back.  We see who really runs this show.  Would you see...  Whoever grabs the back of who's hair.  You know what?  The faces of the viewers at home, the fans of Peabody's and Buttheads.  Just the Butthead face of just... 
[03:10:00]  Like...  Used to see Anthony's eyes closed.  Yeah.  People would freeze frame on the DVR where Ant's head was tilted and the mouth was open  and Ope was leaning in.  And Ope was still looking at it, looking where he was going, and his hand was on the back  of his head.  You zoom and you can see Ant's tongue fluttering up through the touch.  And Ope's fingers were wrapped around the back of his head like a cantaloupe. 
[03:10:30]  You guys really have this fantasy in your head?  Not a fantasy.  It sounds like you've been working on it for a while.  Why don't you guys show us how it's done?  Yeah, go ahead.  Check it out.  Come on.  All right.  Come on.  Both of you.  And when you're two-part, I want to see a little bit of spittle in between.  I'll tell you one thing I've learned living in the same building as Norton.  You'll never out-gay Norton.  He'll stick his tongue right down your throat.  Bob tries this.  As a joke.  You've got to be careful who you do this with, though.  But with your friends.  We're all friends, Ricky.  We're all friends.  Pass it around.  Yeah, you've been friends, Ricky. 
[03:11:00]  Come on!  Absent.  Should we take a break?  Bob would come over and try to out-gay me.  This is usually the comedy cellar where he tries to, like, he'll just try to lean in like  he's going to kiss you.  Now, I know Bob doesn't want to kiss me.  No.  How do you know?  Because you have just juicy mongrel lips.  And you have thin paper lips.  Exactly.  So we're perfect.  And he would lean in like he was going to try to kiss me.  I'm supposed to jump back.  Yeah.  But I'll stand right there.  God, it's stupid.  And then he looks stupid.  Because if you allow somebody to bully you like that, every time they see you, they're 
[03:11:30]  going to fucking try to lean in like they're going to do something.  And they're going to bully you.  But I can't be bullied like that.  You're a tough guy.  Not about a tough guy.  I just won't be bullied by the likes of him.  He's a tough guy.  He won't let me kiss him.  I'm a tough guy.  He'll suck my face.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  We're going to take a break with one of my favorite bands out these days.  Wolf Mother.  Oh, they were on Leno last night.  They're actually Torgasm.  That's the song.  I know.  I love that band.  What's the name of that song again? 
[03:12:00]  Dimension.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's a great song.  They were on Leno last night.  Yeah, they're blowing up, man.  They're huge.  This is a live version of Woman by Wolf Mother on Leno last night.  My next guest, one of their top ten bands to watch in 2006.  Tonight, they're performing a song from their self-titled CD.  Getting great reviews.  Please welcome Wolf Mother.  Yeah.  Woman, you know you're a woman. 
[03:12:30]  You got to be a woman.  I got the feeling of love.  And you're talking to me.  Seen through me.  I got the feeling of love.  She's a woman.  You know what I mean.  You better listen.  Listen to me.  It's going to set you free.  Yeah.  It's going to set you free. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  I got the feeling of love.  Yeah.  We'll be right back. 
[03:13:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:14:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:14:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:15:00]  All right, we're back. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, I mean, to reveal your own homosexuality, I told you guys, it was amazing.  I can't believe they cut it out.  But it'll be on the DVD, right?  Yeah.  With commentary.  Yeah.  All right.  Bob Kelly podcasts.  What's up?  Oh.  Do you do podcasts? 
[03:16:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got them on my MySpace.  Ew.  Yeah, but Jimmy, you're part of one of them.  Yeah, but Jimmy.  I did a favor for a friend.  Oh, no.  Can I just say something to that?  Yeah, Bob.  First of all.  Yeah, you talk.  What the hell?  Yeah, you can kiss on our show.  You go ahead.  You fucking three have a fucking beautiful radio show you get to go to and be creative  every day.  Yeah.  And sometimes me and my friend calling the lonely and fat and shoveling food in our miles  around three o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  And we want to feel like we, you know.  You know, I can't even fault you because we do have this radio show. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  And there are times I just want to do a little podcast.  I like the technology and everything.  It's unbelievable.  I can call on your phone.  I don't want to do a little podcast.  Why don't you?  It would be kind of weird.  Do you want to do a podcast with me?  No, I want to do my own.  Good, exactly.  You should just be rejected in front of two countries.  Is it just audio or video podcast?  Just audio.  See, I would do video one from like down in my basement so it looks like a bunker.  You'd actually edit it and put special effects. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  You're making it a Star Wars 7.  By the way.  Creep.  His iMac.  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Colin Quinn not happy that he was not a part of this traveling virus tour.  I don't blame him.  What happened with that?  That wasn't our call.  Don't blame him.  No, it wasn't.  I know it wasn't.  He was not happy.  He was called?  Was he?  He had to have been.  No.  Get Pete on the phone.  No, he wasn't.  Why wouldn't he be called?  I don't think he was. 
[03:17:30]  I have no idea.  I know.  He wasn't.  He wanted to be on it.  Oh.  Well, how are we going to make good?  I don't know.  Can he be at it or is he that mad?  I don't think he's that mad.  That's not how much money he wants.  I'd love to see him at it.  I was told all these guys were called.  I think they should be.  Ryan Regan said no to us.  Regan turned the show down on everyone.  Well, I don't know.  Because he went for the clean image.  He should definitely have him following on.  He was scared.  He didn't want his image to be associated with like.  I don't get it.  Because he could have done his act as clean as possible.  He would have killed him. 
[03:18:00]  You should definitely have him on.  Collins should be on the show.  Of course.  Because you definitely need a break in the middle of the show.  I thought he said no to us.  I swear to God.  This is the first time hearing this.  Because we called pretty much everyone that's associated with this show.  I asked Pete afterwards.  I'm like, why isn't Colin on?  Like, I forget Colin.  I forget he asked him and he turned it down.  I didn't even.  Or he didn't want to do it or whatever.  And I don't know if Pete asked him.  I think Pete thought that Colin might want too much money.  Like, we couldn't afford him.  I don't know.  That's what I thought.  Because some of the guys, you know.  Let's get Pete on the horn. 
[03:18:30]  I love saying that.  Well, maybe we can make good on that.  Yeah, exactly.  We do need some people driven up there.  So if Colin wants to rent a car.  Fucking throw him a few dollars to take some people up.  Maybe get him a host.  Because he can say HBO for you.  He knows HBO for me.  That's a good point.  He knows VH1.  One of my favorite moments ever.  Jim Norton did New Year's in Philly.  And he had Colin on the bill.  And he made sure everyone knew that Colin was warming up for him.  What an ambit.  The letters were so small.  I made the shirt for you.  I hated it.  I'm saying Bobby made me a shirt that had the fucking Jim Norton, Rich Washington, teeny letters, Colin Quinn. 
[03:19:00]  Colin Quinn.  And people at the cellar were so sad.  And like Ava, I walked in with it.  And they just went, oh.  They couldn't even laugh at stupid Colin.  Yeah, it was a T-shirt of the marquee.  It's just awful.  And I talked to dumb Colin last night because he's unshaven and just miserable looking.  Oh, he's a mess.  Colin should definitely be on board.  He's still wearing tough crowd clothes.  Oh, but he's like, you know.  Except when you look at it on and out, it looks like tough crowd. 
[03:19:30]  He has to stretch the bottom of his shirts out like a little sundress.  Just so it fits in.  Like a sundress.  Just hangs from his tits.  Like a flirty skirt.  Yeah, it's got ruffles.  His T-shirts have ruffles now from stretching them out with his forearms before he puts them on.  His fat-titted, barrel-chested ass.  Fucking finished.  Oh, damn.  You think he stretches them so they're getting on the show as good as them?  Oh, they're trying not to hit his sides.  And I only know this because I'm a fatso, too. 
[03:20:00]  But he showed up at the cellar one night.  It didn't fit.  You could see his belt.  Oh, my God.  The only thing that fits now is his shoes.  Fatso.  He's trying to wear like track jackets to hide his fatness.  His friggin' neck just disappears into his chin.  Oh, he's all fucking blotchy, too, because he's always hot and cold.  Fatso.  Oh, that poor bastard.  And later in the night, I call him.  I swear to God.  I just call him just to hear in the background the, uh, this. 
[03:20:30]  The ruffling of some paper bag and some type of food he's trying to sneak out of.  Sneak a muffin into his fat-bearded face.  So what are you doing, calling nothing?  Are you eating anything?  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Pete Papalato.  Pete.  Hello?  What happened with Colin?  Hello, Pete Papalato's office.  Hmm.  Hello?  Who's this?  Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, Opie. 
[03:21:00]  What?  How you doing?  Weren't you just here?  Yeah, but I'm over here now.  Have we cloned you or something?  I'm over here now.  No, like I'm conducting business for the Traveling Virus Tour this Saturday at Worcester.  And what's going on with the launch seats for the Philly show?  Oh, funny you should ask.  They go on sale Friday.  We got a special $10 price this weekend and this weekend only.  So act fast because then after this weekend they go to $20.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Hey, ask Pete why Colin Quinn's not on the lineup. 
[03:21:30]  All right.  Hey, Pete.  Do you know why Colin Quinn's not on the lineup?  We just, uh, we got to put an offer up to him.  Should we add him to Cleveland?  Do you want to add him to Cleveland?  Yeah, we'd love to have him.  No.  On as many shows as possible.  After all that, no, no.  We got a yes and a no.  No, he's a yes.  It's yes all around the room.  We got yeses all the way around.  We'd love to have him.  You're asking why he's on the other ones?  Yeah.  How come he's not doing it?  You put him on the spot.  Uh, have you seen his act? 
[03:22:00]  Jesus.  It's a lot of people to bore at once.  All right.  Get back to your meeting.  All right, we'll walk on it.  Yeah, try to get him at least, uh, for the Cleveland show.  Hezbollah.  Hezbollah.  We'll make good.  Hezbollah.  I don't know.  Israel.  Hezbollah.  You know?  What are you going to do, Pete?  Folks, you know, Hezbollah's crazy.  Oh, let's move on.  I'm not going to fight Tyson.  All right, Bob.  Anyways, I had a show.  All right, let's give it up for your next act.  He's been on HBO.  Yeah.  Well, guys, uh, we're going to try to do two more things before we get out of here. 
[03:22:30]  The podcast, but we forgot about the, uh, the 12-step program for Mel Gibson that the  Daily News printed up today.  Oh, you know, when the newspapers get a hold of a subject and they can make comedy of it.  Yeah, you want?  It's always gold.  Making mirth, Ant.  Making mirth.  Oh, some of the funniest stuff you're going to read is when the newspapers decide to take  a comic angle on, uh, one of the top stories.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they got 12, uh, a 12-step program for Mel Gibson. 
[03:23:00]  All right.  Starting with number 12, Anthony.  Oh, we're counting backwards.  I like the idea of counting backwards.  Backwards.  As atonement.  Uh, well, is that the best one, though?  They all stink.  So how can you tell if you should go from one down or 12 up?  Because there's numbers in front of them.  That's the only way to tell.  All right.  You want to start with one?  Because I guess if it is 12 steps, you got to start with it.  You got to start with it.  Atta boy, oh, wait a look at the program.  I'm smart.  I'll say.  As atonement.  No, that's 12.  Aren't we supposed to read 12? 
[03:23:30]  No, Anthony, we're going.  You don't go step 12 to step one.  Nobody starts at the top of the steps.  All of a sudden, you're going to walk back up the steps.  Oh, okay.  You start from the bottom.  All right.  Number one.  You work your way to 12.  Sorry.  I can't get past the hunk on the bottom.  Here we go.  That's true.  Oh, he's dreamy.  Number one.  As atonement.  Number one.  Read the diary of Anne Frank.  That's fucking much depressing.  Why would you?  There's no laughs in that till the end.  Night by Eli Wiesel. 
[03:24:00]  That's on Oprah's book club.  The Chosen by...  That's Oprah's selection.  Is it?  Night.  I missed it completely.  I hate when I miss something.  What do we miss for?  Damn it.  What do we miss?  I don't want to wait for the replay.  I need a DVR in front of me for this show.  He said there's nothing funny about reading it.  Until the end.  I heard that.  Until the end?  Yeah, that was good.  Oh, shit. 
[03:24:30]  That's like watching Roots backwards so it has a happy ending.  I thought that was all right.  That was all right.  I don't know.  Number one makes no sense.  I heard that joke when I was in sixth grade.  Oh, no.  This is going to be an 11-step program because I'm done.  What do you get when you play a country song backwards?  What?  I'm not telling you.  Why?  Wait, wait, wait.  Pull your stuff back?  That's pretty funny.  Something about a dog, a car, and your wife.  I don't remember that. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  Go ahead, man.  Sorry.  Oh, The Chosen by Chaim Potak, from Beirut to Jerusalem by Thomas Friedman, and Maus  by Art Spiegelman.  So he's got to do a lot of reading in the first time.  By Jews, all Jewish authors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Number two, see the film.  The film's Life is Beautiful, Sophie's Choice, Schindler's List, even Exodus.  Watch Paperclips, a documentary about Christian children who, to comprehend the number of 
[03:25:30]  Jews killed in the Holocaust, collected six million paperclips.  Wait a minute.  I don't get that.  Well, they collected paperclips, and wow, that's a lot of paperclips.  So that's a lot of-  Yeah, because six million's just a number, but if you have six million of something in  front of you, you're like, wow.  I didn't realize.  A lot of dead Jews.  Then why did they just make it easier, though?  Like six million atoms or electrons? 
[03:26:00]  Because when you collect six million paperclips, it gives you a visualization of how many-  That's how thin they were.  But who?  And what?  Oh, my God.  I knew someone was going to say it.  Believe me.  It popped in my head the second I read it.  Bob Kelly, he doesn't get paid.  What are you going to do?  He's just a guest on the Anthony Show.  Last time.  I promise we'll ban him for life.  Easy.  Why?  What's going on?  I'm a little drunk.  I'm a little drunk.  Get to keep our jobs.  I'm just drunk.  Oh!  Hey!  Fuck me in the ass! 
[03:26:30]  I can't drink on the fucking show!  Fuck you, cop.  Are you a paperclip?  Yeah, you fucking-  You're a fucking paperclip.  Hey, hey.  I heard the paperclips are cops now.  Paperclips start all the wars.  Yeah, paperclips run Hollywood.  Haven't you heard?  Visit the Holocaust Museum in New York, Washington, and Jerusalem.  So he's got to go on a little tour.  In Jerusalem.  There.  That's good to go.  I accidentally went into the one in Boston.  It's like right on the sidewalk.  Isn't that creepy?  You're just walking in Boston.  All of a sudden, you're in like some steamy steam. 
[03:27:00]  They're all right over there at Fanyol Hall.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what that steam is, right?  What?  That's the bones of the Jews.  I thought it was supposed to be like the gas or something.  Yeah, it's the gas on the meat.  It represents like the gas.  So all of a sudden, you're walking through, and you're in like gas.  And there's like glass walls with names on them and stuff.  Yeah.  It's a little creepy.  And then you're like, what the hell am I in?  Oh, a Holocaust memorial.  Oh, a memorial.  But right near all the bars.  Right near all the party spots.  Of course, yeah.  I mean, drunk.  Get drunk and get gassed.  All right, let's go.  Visit Auschwitz. 
[03:27:30]  That's the fifth step of the 12-step program.  Yes.  For Mel Gibson.  Six, or the Western Wall.  Seven, read the Old Testament.  Number nine works.  I think he's probably read the Old Testament.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eight, go to a Passover Seder.  Nine, or a Sabbath dinner.  That's fucking fantastic.  I don't know how that would help, but just sit there with Aussie.  Yeah.  Tony and Bill just talking about Jewish people.  Aussie, pass the salt.  Fucking Jews, I understand everything, Mel. 
[03:28:00]  I don't understand why people don't like them.  What the fuck is this?  It's paperclips, mate.  Everyone I deal with is Jewish.  Saren, dealing with money is all Jews.  I don't know.  Check, please.  Fucking sensitive.  Ten, sit shiva.  Sit shiva.  What is that?  I believe that's when a Jewish person dies.  They sit shiva.  Yeah.  It's sitting on a box for a certain period of time.  I love number 11.  Have a sit down with Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, and Billy Crystal. 
[03:28:30]  Isn't that capital punishment?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Mel Brooks and Woody would be a wonderful sit down, but...  Why would you want to sit down with Billy so you could ask for a picture when you have  the same manager?  No cameras!  So you could talk about Mickey Mantle again.  So you could go, hey, can I get a picture?  I thought you were really great tonight.  I'm a comedian.  No cameras!  But I said I was a comedian.  No cameras!  Sorry, I just figured we were expressing the same art form.  No cameras! 
[03:29:00]  Hold a grudge?  Oh, believe me.  Hold a grudge like the JDL.  No kidding, man.  It's amazing.  It's unbelievable.  Jesus.  He never forgets to get that tattoo.  Never forget.  Jimmy Neeson never forgets tattoo.  Never forget that Billy Crystal blew me off for a photo.  Just like the Holocaust.  It was a photo Holocaust.  He doesn't even follow the Yankees anymore.  He hasn't cheated his number.  He doesn't even follow the Yankees anymore.  No.  It's unbelievable.  Why would I?  Exactly.  I spoke my mind about that whole situation. 
[03:29:30]  They're in first place.  What?  They're in first place.  Who cares?  Are you still mad at him?  Give a fuck what they do, yeah.  He'll be mad at me.  I will always be mad.  Yeah, that's just how he is.  We accept it now.  He's looking for a Red Sox hat.  Really?  He doesn't understand forgiveness or anything.  Not for that.  I love Rivera, though.  I'll always root for Mo.  Alright, good old Mo.  Forget lizard face.  The 12th step.  I fucking hate Mo.  12th step.  As atonement, eat 10 pounds of pastrami, which Zero Mostel said, quote, killed more Jews 
[03:30:00]  than Hitler.  You fish-faced enemy of the people.  Zero Mostel say that?  Well, Daily News is terrific with their comedy writing.  It's just wonderful.  I thought that was supposed to be comedy.  I don't know.  I don't know what it was supposed to be.  Wasn't there a comedy one?  Because I don't think that was it.  Alright.  I think they were being serious.  Jimmy in the elevator, is this good, Jimmy?  Jimmy in an elevator.  I don't know.  I don't know.  God.  Well, it was more fun to be there than I think the audio will be. 
[03:30:30]  It was appalling.  It was just kind of Jimmy on the phone.  One girl tried to get out.  And then she saw that we got out and she got back in.  Like, we need a reaction from the people, because I know they're horrified.  What he says is atrocious.  It's a good visual, though.  We're all in the elevator together.  Yeah.  Well, I don't go in the elevator anymore.  I gave up.  I can't do it anymore.  Our elevator ride up.  So, it's Jimmy and Anthony, and today it was Bob Kelly, a few other show members, and  then a lot of people just going to work in the same building. 
[03:31:00]  So, just picture that.  People you don't know at all.  And let me clarify something.  The reason I'll use the same line of gag every time is because you kind of have to hit quick  and barbaric.  Yeah.  It's only five floors.  Is that why you farted on my dick?  It's only five floors.  No one's stopping on one through four.  I did fart on Bob's dick on the CBS ride down.  Yeah.  Right on the tip of my dick, and it vibrated my nut.  I had a gastric.  I just pushed up against his fucking helmet and cut the gastric on his dick.  I swear to God, it went through my dick like a current and vibrated my nut.  Not even both of them. 
[03:31:30]  My left one.  It vibrated my nut.  It hit like a vein and went right to my nut.  It was fucking unbelievable.  Like he farted in my pee hole.  Here's Jim Norton.  Talented.  I think we got a big star calling in in a second here.  Jim Norton in the elevator.  This is Among Strangers.  Get room for one more.  Sorry.  Yeah.  On the phone.  Shit. 
[03:32:00]  I hate that.  I hate that shit.  It's not good.  Just tell him.  I'm not home.  I don't care.  I don't want any kids.  She knows that.  I'll put you down the stairs.  What are you doing?  Oh, God.  Did you hear the lady in the background say, excuse me?  That's why I said, what are you doing?  I was saying it to her.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  She got off the elevator and then got back home when she saw we were getting off.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  He goes, no, I don't want kids. 
[03:32:30]  I'll kick her down the stairs.  Let's say hi to Mark Burnett.  Mark.  There he is.  Mark Burnett.  Hey, it's Mark Burnett.  Mark, how you doing, man?  From Rockstar.  How you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Very good, Mark.  What's going on?  Well, remember I told you that I would get Tommy on the phone this morning?  Yes.  And I am going to.  Did you watch Rockstar?  Yeah, it was terrific last night.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Great episode.  Performances were really, really good.  Yep.  And people love Tommy playing drums.  Oh, hell yeah.  Tommy on drums was just amazing.  Tommy, they're kicking ass. 
[03:33:00]  Anyway, you know, when I told Tommy about my first experience on your show and that chick,  he said, I have to get on the phone with these guys.  All right, cool.  Oh.  Remember that?  Yes.  Okay, here's Tommy.  Hold on.  All right.  Hey, dude.  What's up, Tommy?  Tommy Lee.  I hear some lady with enormously gigantic ta-tas was chasing Mark around the room.  Now, Tommy, you've seen a lot of women over the course of your career, a lot of tits,  big ones, small ones, implants, natural, all that shit. 
[03:33:30]  This woman had implants that had valves in her armpits.  Oh, my God.  And she could blow them up or deflate them as per needed.  Yeah, when she had a cool gig, she would blow them up nice and big.  And then when she went home to the family for, like, Thanksgiving or whatever, she would  deflate them.  It was like, yeah.  Back it down a few notches.  It was like when it was really pumped up, her breastbone looked like the cellophane pulled  over ribs at a supermarket where you could just rip right through it. 
[03:34:00]  And her armpits, her tits had gotten so big that it pulled the skin from her armpits to  the side of her tits.  So she had armpit razor stubble on the sides of her tits.  Oh, that's disgusting.  It was fucking disgusting.  Are you guys serious?  Like, really had valves?  Yeah, valves.  She would like, and it was under the skin.  So it had to be done with a syringe.  We've only seen that once in our careers.  Never saw it again.  Never saw it again.  I gotta see this.  What a freak show.  I think she has a website, actually. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  What the hell was her name?  We'll try to find a website for her to hang up.  Yeah, I know this.  Stump thing.  I got her a movie role and she never showed up for it, so I kind of resent her.  Yeah, bitch.  I know.  Mark's kind of a plus for running away, isn't he?  Yeah, he should have stayed there and just took it like a man.  Hey, man.  I would have never done that.  Now, of course, I'm going to ask this question because as a drummer, I gotta say, how underrated  was Bill Ward?  Very underrated.  That guy shredded, dude.  Wasn't he fucking the greatest?  And people just never give him the same credit they gave like a lot of other great, like, you  know, Bonham and Moon? 
[03:35:00]  I know.  Yeah, that's so true.  Yeah, that guy shreds.  Well, that was Jimmy Norton.  He's a huge, huge Sabbath fan.  Yeah, but I also acknowledge that Tommy Lee's a great drummer.  Everything goes back to Sabbath.  Tommy Lee likes Zeppelin over Sabbath.  He might.  All right.  I do, actually.  I prefer Bonham over.  See?  All right.  That's fair.  I think Bill Ward would probably agree with you.  He's still a badass.  Yeah, fair enough.  I'm not talking about drums.  I'm just talking about bands.  Zeppelin over Sabbath.  It's been an ongoing theme on the show.  That's all, Tom.  Really?  Hey, by the way, it's Mistress Rhiannon.  And she has a website. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, hold on.  What is it again?  Mistress.  You know how to spell that.  And then Rhiannon.  R-H.  Yeah, it's weird.  I-A.  R-H.  I-A.  N-N-O-N.  N-N-O-N.  Dot com, obviously.  Got it.  Or is it this one, too?  Yeah.  Oh, and N-J-Mistress.com.  And what is it?  N-J.  N-J is the New Jersey abbreviation.  N-J-Mistress.com.  There you go.  Mistress.com.  There you go.  Check her out.  Go to that one first, by the way.  Freakish.  Okay, I'll check that. 
[03:36:00]  Freakish.  Wow, that's incredible.  So you got this band thing going?  Pretty cool?  Yeah, dude.  You guys been watching?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  What are you thinking of some of the prospects?  There's a couple that are really freaking me out that I'm absolutely in love with.  Yeah, it sounds like you want to bang them more than play with them.  Well, someone's got to.  Isn't it a little odd when you...  What's wrong with that?  But your gigs are going to suck.  I actually watched his other show last... 
[03:36:30]  He's on two shows.  He's on Tommy Goes to College, too, which I watched last night.  And you got chicks on that, too.  You got...  Like, the college girls are all fighting over you.  Uh-huh.  Always with the chicks.  God bless you.  Isn't it odd that when you realize, like, some of the best singers in the world can just be sitting there humping at a day job and never, ever make it or even give it a try?  I know.  You know, there's incredibly talented people all over the world and that just never, ever get recognized or get a break or anything like that. 
[03:37:00]  You know, there's a lot of them, dude.  We went through hundreds and hundreds of videotapes and auditions.  And it's unbelievable.  There's really a lot of talented people out there that just, you know, never get a break or some luck or, you know, seen or heard.  Pretty crazy.  Yeah.  You talking to the crew guys at all?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're actually getting ready to go out in September with Aerosmith.  Nice.  Yeah.  Actually, uh... 
[03:37:30]  Hey, are you going to make a movie out of that book?  Oh, we actually are.  We met the director the other day and, um...  What's the name of the book again?  I can't remember.  The Dirt.  Yeah, The Dirt was one of the most amazing rock books ever written.  It's the Bible, son.  Oh, my God.  Not going to get an argument here.  Of course.  I read it in two days.  I couldn't...  What was it?  I heard it.  I don't know.  The Dirt.  It's all about Motley Crue in L.A.  Great book.  Great book.  I mean, the stories and, you know, not washing their dicks and...  Oh, wait, wait, wait. 
[03:38:00]  I can't even do it justice.  Like...  Was there another Motley Crue book or was that the one?  That's the one.  Oh, I did read that.  That was fucking fantastic.  Great book.  Tacos on the Dick, I think.  Yeah, what was the Tacos on the Dick story again?  Oh, the Burritos.  Burritos, right.  Burritos.  Yeah, where Nick, he was fucking around on his wife.  Oh, no, his girlfriend at the time.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so there's this place called Noggles.  It's like a Del Taco or whatever.  And we'd stop in there at about two in the morning and he would get an egg burrito and 
[03:38:30]  stick his dick inside of it so it wouldn't smell like pussy.  But it doesn't account for why your dick smells like an egg burrito.  Did you fuck a burrito?  It smells like a breakfast burrito.  It's one story after another.  You can't put the book down.  The book's awesome.  And it's going to be a movie.  That's awesome.  It's going to be a fun movie.  Now, are you guys playing yourselves at all in any part of it?  Not that I know of, but I don't know.  You never know.  How's Mick doing?  Is he doing good?  Yeah, he's doing really, really well, man.  Really well.  Tommy's got to be played by a black guy in white face. 
[03:39:00]  Because we've all seen the fucking video.  Hey, that ended up helping you out in the end.  Not that you needed help, but.  Oh, Jesus.  It's just you're now in legendary status with the likes of, like, Milton Berle and Forrest  Tucker, who's supposed to have a big dick.  The guy that played, he was in F Troop.  Remember him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was, like, second to Milton Berle for the big dick.  And then you now are known for, like, being a big dick guy. 
[03:39:30]  James Woods.  James Woods is supposed to have a big dick.  This is my observation.  You hear about all the guys in Hollywood that had the big, huge dicks.  Who's hung like an acorn?  That's what I want to ask that out.  Jackie Chan.  I'm sure Bruce Lee was.  You're not on the Asian list.  I would picture, like, Jason Alexander probably has a little one.  Yeah, and he's angry about it.  With one big ball.  You guys, two guys in this room.  Not me.  Not me.  I got the tuna can.  Not me, friend.  Yeah, I also heard about Carmen Electra one day told me that Kid Rock pulled his pants 
[03:40:00]  down at this pool party.  And she's like, that dude is, like, hung like a light switch.  Oh, shit.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Dude, put your pants back up.  Well, that could pose a little bit of a problem for the honeymoon.  Not good.  And not only was Tommy's thing huge thing, it was actually pretty.  Not that I'm being fagged, Tom.  I bet you don't get many of those compliments.  That's Robert Kelly from Torgasm.  Yeah, that's Robert Kelly.  He's on Torgasm on HBO.  Yes, and he's a flaming queer. 
[03:40:30]  No, I'm not a queer.  I'm just saying, Tom.  You just admitted you were queer during the break.  No, I didn't.  That was a gag, you fucking homo.  Oh, I was barring into it.  I was barring into it.  It sticks straight up.  It's not to the left, not to the right.  No pulsing big fat veins.  You don't got a fader?  Hey, guys.  Yes.  I got to get to the stage here.  Oh, shit.  But I thought we were all having fun and stuff.  I know.  I thought we were all kind of just relating.  Having a good time.  Tommy, got to bring up one more thing, though.  What do you got to bring up?  Do you recall the last time you were on our show?  No, no, no. 
[03:41:00]  We're past that now.  I just want to know.  I just want to know if you recall it.  It got a little ugly.  It got a little ugly.  It did get ugly?  Yeah, like Opie called you a pussy, and you said, call me a pussy one more time, and I'm  fucking hanging up.  And he goes, all right, pussy.  And you hung up.  That's right.  And that was the last we ever spoke to you.  And that was about five years ago.  I know it sucked about that.  We've had you on the show many times over the years.  Not that you would remember.  Before that.  We had a pretty good relationship with you, and then it all went to shit. 
[03:41:30]  Went down the fucking shitter.  It's all love.  All love.  That was 2004, right?  No, it was like 2002.  Two, yeah.  It goes back a lot.  Maybe even before that.  I don't know.  Actually, it was hip-hop, Tommy, at the time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You were doing the hip-hop thing.  Dude, Methods of Mayhem was 99, though?  I didn't realize it was seven years ago.  No, yeah, it was 2000, right?  It was a long time ago, man.  Wow, Jesus.  Methods of Mayhem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  For old times' sake, Ope, call him a pussy.  No, it's all right.  No way.  Call me a pussy, dude.  Just call him a pussy.  All right. 
[03:42:00]  Wait, because, Tommy, you got to go, right?  Yeah, dude.  All right.  So, after Ope calls you a pussy, just hang up.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Um, you pussy.  Hey, easy.  Not so ferocious, Ope.  I'm cool with it.  It was back in the day.  We had our proms, and it was a bummer, because, you know, I love these guys in my crew, but  of course, things happen.  So, Rockstar.  Don't forget to watch the show.  Yeah, Rockstar, the supergroup's called Supernova.  Eight o'clock tonight. 
[03:42:30]  Yes, sir.  And on CBS.  And, Tommy, you don't give a crap about Kid Rock and the X-Ray.  Oh, dude, that's so 2004.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  I love you guys.  All right.  Thank you, Tommy.  See you, man.  Bye, dudes.  Have a good one, man.  All right.  Later, man.  Later, man.  Whatever you do, don't let your meatloaf.  All right.  Oh, Tommy.  Hey, everyone.  It's a food dick joke.  That is funny.  He threw that Kid Rock jab, though.  Oh, yeah.  Imagine following Tommy.  Because you can't even then joke back about, well, his dick is huge. 
[03:43:00]  He's hung like a lamp.  You're hung like a light switch.  Yeah.  What do you got?  Oh, I see.  The whole thing.  You guys have switched forward.  Oh, my God.  Well, did you have to describe his cock as...  I had to bring it up.  What?  I had to bring it up.  Bob went through a fucking...  Oh, it's okay.  Yeah.  There's a complete description of his cock.  Like, no, but there's no vein.  It stands straight up.  Wow, you really looked at it.  Yeah.  It was like he was...  It was a perp that had robbed you, and you were fucking giving...  It probably did rob Bob of all illusions that he likes girls.  Wow.  That was well put together.  I know.  Let me sniff my belly button as a reward for that.  Good boy, Jimmy. 
[03:43:30]  Good boy.  I can't get tuna can out of my head.  Let's say how to Nate.  I know.  Not the size, the odor.  Let's say how to Nate.  You smell like tuna.  Oh, I got jeans and white socks.  Old Jimmy Dean.  Let's say how to Nate.  Nate in New Orleans.  New Orleans.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Welcome aboard, Nate.  What's up, Nate?  Love you.  Welcome aboard the crazy ship.  I love you, mofos.  Hey, Jimmy, you look great on that show.  Why do you always look pissed off on Sunday nights? 
[03:44:00]  That's a character.  Yeah, it is a character choice.  I mean, it kind of developed, and that's what I like to do.  That's Rich.  I mean, he's a miserable fuck.  You do a great job.  You do a great...  You're a funny son of a bitch.  Thanks.  Hey, listen, uh...  He gets foiled.  So you guys talking about small dicks?  Yes, we were.  First of all, let me give a disclaimer.  I've never touched one other than my own, and I am not a homo, but...  Missing out.  When a guy pulls up next to you and you're taking a wedge, you know the unwritten rule  of men. 
[03:44:30]  You don't look at his dick unless he's fucking Bruce Springsteen.  So I'm taking a picture.  This is the type of thing that could get us in trouble, so I just want to preface this  by saying this is what Nate's saying.  I mean, I have no fucking idea what kind of cock Bruce Springsteen has.  Where were you?  All right.  So a friend of mine, Rhonda Shearer, I don't know if you know her.  Yes, who knows who she is?  Well, Rhonda's from New Orleans, and I was out there visiting her, and so we were at Spago,  and I go in the men's room, and I'm taking a leak, and he comes with his little short ass, 
[03:45:00]  pulls up right next to me, and so I had to lean over and take a peek.  Of course you did.  He's hung like a freaking cymbal.  Maybe he was shy.  Plus, he's fucking Bruce doesn't have to be hung.  That is true.  Yeah, he's his wife.  Because he's Bruce, he doesn't have to be hung, he's Bruce Springsteen, who cares?  His wife probably cares.  No, she doesn't.  You know why?  Because she sucks his little dick and then goes for a ride in a Jaguar and buys a banana.  What does she care? 
[03:45:30]  You know what?  And my problem is, I got no money and no dick, so.  All right.  And no joke to that fucking point.  You know what, sir?  I got on jeans and white socks.  I'm like Brando and the Wild Ones.  You are.  All right.  Guys, come on down.  Hey, it's hurricane season.  Come on down.  Ah, can't wait.  Yeah, good luck to you guys.  You know why hurricane's always named after girls?  Because if they were named after boys, it'd be called himmicanes.  Do you know that was my favorite joke when I was a boy?  Did it make you laugh?  Yes, it did internally. 
[03:46:00]  Because you can't really express laughter outside.  No, due to the fact that my mother drank ammonia during pregnancy.  And that's caused the affliction that makes you, um, frank.  Yes.  Allegedly, when my mother was pregnant, Raphael said the eye kicker in the stomach.  Hey, Frank, you're going to make an appearance at the O&A Traveling Bank?  I don't probably think so.  I'm not sure.  I have to work.  Busy man. 
[03:46:30]  That's, I wash the tires of UPS trucks for a living.  What a job.  Hey, let's say hi to Charles, I guess.  Charles?  Hey, I got a request.  Can I hear back in the New York roof?  We didn't play that at all today.  Yeah, you know what, though, dude?  I got some fucking, I got musical chops.  That's what I do.  And after talking with Tommy Lee.  That's good.  Oh, fuck, I should have told Tommy I was a drummer.  You did.  You did.  You did.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you did.  You said being a drummer. 
[03:47:00]  From one drummer to another.  From one drummer to another.  No, no, I didn't mean that.  I was saying being a drummer, meaning Tommy, you're a drummer.  Being a drummer.  Oh, to me, it even sounded like you were saying being a drummer.  Oh, no, no.  Like yourself.  So I think the point got across inadvertently.  Hey, uh, you want to play the long version?  Nah, the short version.  Because at least people wanting more.  Yeah.  There is a long version.  Someone liked the short version.  Someone kind of looked at it.  All right, long version.  Something happens on that show.  Yeah.  We're back. 
[03:47:30]  Back in the New York room.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  Welcome back to the OVN Anthony Show.  My favorite part. 
[03:48:00]  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Why is that not?  Is that what intros the show every day?  It's a hit.  It's a hit.  He puts more energy into that.  And then someone took it and kind of tracked it a little.  I did the drums and they put in the horns of the other instruments.  It was just a drum set in the studio.  And he just, that's really him playing.  That's what we play from the New York Dolls.  We're doing the radio check in the afternoon.  So they had to set up the equipment the night before.  So I play the drums, come back in and break a couple of times.  A couple of times.  What are you doing? 
[03:48:30]  Pass it around.  Showing that anyone could do it.  Yeah.  Do we have time to do the podcast?  We should probably leave.  I hope so.  What time is it?  We should leave early today.  Feeling your hog?  What time is it?  We're going to leave early today.  You're fucking grabbing your mule.  Are we?  Yeah, we've got an interview to do with Mike from Billboard Monitor.  Oh.  So maybe we can play something.  I have to go.  That's why.  And you've got somewhere else to go.  I have to go to Spike TV.  Let me see.  Do I have anything to do today? 
[03:49:00]  Hey, watch.  I have a magic computer.  And it answers me.  Do I have anything to do today?  I'm waiting.  Computer.  It's not as fast as Star Trek where he just asks.  And it goes, working.  And then it goes to...  Oh, I have my accountant guy, Barry Shapiro, at 2.30.  Holy crap. 
[03:49:30]  I've got to thank my computer.  Thank you, baby.  Ian loves his computer.  Who is that?  Yeah.  Let's go to...  Did I mention that I'm falling in...  Well, who?  Go to who?  What did you just say?  Nothing.  Falling into a bucket of AIDS?  Oh, no.  Again?  I'm tap-danced in one.  It ain't a bucket of AIDS until I fall into it.  Oh!  Check out the honey.  Oh, why is it all red?  Dude.  Why is your ass red?  You have a baboon ass.  I'll tell you why.  Oh, my God.  You've been fucked in the ass. 
[03:50:00]  No, I haven't.  Somebody fuck me.  What was his name?  It would be...  By the way, I was sitting.  No, dude.  No, dude.  Your ass...  Can I take a picture and show you?  I would want nothing fast.  You're like Ed Norton crying on the gurney in front of the black guy.  That is fucking disturbing, dude.  It is so red.  Why did you take a picture of that?  Look how close he's getting with the camera.  Go ahead, faggot.  What did you do?  I can't...  Who spanked you?  Hold on.  Jesus Christ.  Someone spanky spanky you.  Nobody spanked me.  All right.  What's the problem with his ass there, Bob?  Jimmy's getting his good camera.  Yeah, of course.  Take it.  Quickly.  Billboard, get this.  Quickly.  Photograph my asshole. 
[03:50:30]  Hang on there, fucking dirtball.  Turn this way, you fucker.  Yeah, turn.  Oh, God.  He's bending over a little.  Good one.  Why is your ass like mandrel red?  First of all, you have fucking a baby curl in your ass.  Last time I saw that ass, it was sitting on my windshield at Lion Country Safari out in  California.  I'll tell you why my ass...  A drive-through safari.  And then you pulled my windshield wiper off and shit on my car.  The reason my ass is red...  I went and beat another alpha male up with my antenna.  The reason it's red is because when I was sitting here... 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  Let me show you.  All right, give us a little show.  Hold on.  It's like red red.  Yeah, it is.  It is monkey ass red.  Yeah, my ass is very clean and here's why.  Because of the way I was sitting like this, up like this, my underwear was digging into  my crack.  You're that sensitive where just sitting a certain way will turn your ass mandrel red.  Yeah, it's just the way I was sitting.  Yeah, but do you have underwear on?  Yeah, always.  But it just was like...  Boxers, right?  Yeah.  You don't wear the tighty-whities. 
[03:51:30]  Why would I?  The diapers.  I wear tighty-whities.  Diapers.  Yeah.  He calls them fucking diapers.  I don't know.  I don't like having maybe a drip after you take a leak run down on my fucking ankle.  Of course not.  You want it collected in the fucking smooth pampers like Mother used to do.  Like Mother used to do.  Are you tighty-whities?  Of course he is.  And wears European underwear, I think.  No, I don't.  And when he has his underwear, he looks like a refugee.  He has a Speedo on.  He has a thin and fat.  No Speedo.  He has like a little fat belly.  I wear your standard briefs. 
[03:52:00]  There's cock hair hanging out the side.  You wear a man cock hair.  He has a spider box.  Oh, so you pull your fucking pants up and a big clump of materials up by your nutsack  all day?  I'm going to sit like this.  Get the fuck out of here with your boxers.  This is the way I was sitting before talking about my jeans.  It's fine.  Boxers are briefs.  You wear a European Speedo underwear?  No.  Well, where did that come from?  You just told me.  You did the deal.  I said I wear regular briefs.  How short on the side?  They are your standard...  How short on the side?  Bob, let's see your underwear.  Get your standard Fruit of the Looms.  How short on the side?  Let's see your underwear.  That's what they are.  That's what they are.  Only their Hanes. 
[03:52:30]  I wear Hanes fucking briefs.  That's it.  Let's see your underwear.  Nice cock.  Why are they gray?  Why are you...  Don't fix your dick.  Let me see.  Look at the size of those.  Those are fucking...  Some big underwear.  Your pants is huge.  I should talk though.  You just turned into a black lady.  Your underpants is huge.  What?  Let me tell you something.  We'll be right back on VH1 with these new videos.  I'll be trying to get whoopies to listeners.  Your underpants is huge.  It's huge.  You'd be huge. 
[03:53:00]  Wow.  Just because you paused me up on a dopey and a pancake, motherfucker.  Those were big.  Those look like underwear when you're stuck in traffic and look at the side of the road  and they're kind of laying there in the gutter somewhere.  Just a big pair of gray underwear.  I can't go swimming in my underwear, homo.  I don't have fucking...  I don't wear Speedos.  You have Rocky Beach in Italy.  They're just like that.  Only five sizes smaller.  You got a fucking little...  In Italy.  ...fucking blue with a red stripe down the side.  I like rock diving.  They match your bag. 
[03:53:30]  Fucking faggot.  You think he has like man sandals too?  Open mandals?  Yeah.  He has a little fag bag.  You are describing things I would never fucking know.  And he's so European.  He actually has clips to pull his skin forward so he looks uncircumcised.  He has a fucking towel with a pillow attached to it.  And he rubs Gouda cheese on the helmet just so it smells authentic.  You go to the beach with a hookah, you fucking little faggot.  I wear standard Hanes briefs. 
[03:54:00]  Are they white?  They are the white, regular size, no up the side.  I do have like Calvin Klein ones and other ones.  That's what we're talking about there.  No, but they're the same thing.  They're just briefs.  Do you talk like an Italian accent when you're at the beach?  They're very nice.  They put them on hangers.  No, they're very nice.  Nice material.  Do you have a little cell phone pocket on your underwear?  No.  Dude, I...  I'm not going to wear fucking boxers and have material bunched up. 
[03:54:30]  your ass when you pull your pants off.  And then what do you do?  You got to reach down and pull the leg back down to your fucking knee?  I have deodorant.  I put deodorant on my balls.  All right, we weren't even going there.  Yeah.  Just to let you know.  Pull it.  Holy shit, a bogey.  What the hell?  They flew out of nowhere.  I know, but I just invented that and it works.  You know what else works so you don't have to do that?  How about some sit-ups?  You know, I bet on the back...  Thanks, I'm sorry.  I bet on the back it says only apply to underarms. 
[03:55:00]  What is on your shirt?  It's an angel with a machine gun.  Jesus.  Yeah, but then it has like...  Oh, it's diamonds.  Those aren't diamonds.  Those are real diamonds.  No, they're not.  No, of course not.  Apply...  Not that kind.  Roll-on.  I don't spray.  Apply only to underarms.  No, roll-on.  I do roll-on.  And it probably says on the back, apply only to underarms.  Put it on your bag?  I put it on the sides of my bag and on the bottom.  And honest to God, it's so you don't sweat.  I like a little high karate.  You still sweat.  My balls don't smell, dude. 
[03:55:30]  I bet you do old English.  Your cologne has a wooden top.  Your cologne came with your underwear.  A little cold spice.  I like my dick to smell like a schooner.  Canoe.  Hey, I was thinking about Ant very recently because I went underpants shopping.  Yeah, which, again, is impossible.  When Anty says it, underpants.  I was laughing so hard because, man, he is so right.  You can't buy underwear anymore unless you're buying Fruit of the Loom like when you were a fucking kid. 
[03:56:00]  I wanted to step up a notch and get Calvin Klein or some kind of better material.  Just thicker material.  But you can't do it unless your girlfriend's with you.  Because you have to look at boxes of fucking guys with big bulges.  Every box of this underwear is just guys, abs, fucking big, just big gay guys.  Hard to shop when you're salivating.  And you don't want to go, you feel like awkward going to the counter with that. 
[03:56:30]  And what the fuck store is it?  Banana Republic where they give you a big bag with just Abercrombie.  It's half-naked guys on the bag that you now have to walk around the fucking mall with.  You have to walk around Manhattan with.  Thank you very much.  Right.  Who thought of that one?  Oh, this is a good, I got a good idea for a bag.  It's a little, little, little, little, little.  Get the one off your fucking nose first and then design one for the store.  So, hairdo.  Now, on the sides of your panties, Anthony. 
[03:57:00]  Panties, yeah.  Do you have like a little tag on the side of your panties?  No.  Is it like a one inch, like, is it an inch on the side?  No, no matter how much you want to fantasize about my fucking underwear having, being a  string bikini, like I'm wearing a fucking thong.  I can picture you like that.  It is exactly like yours, only a smaller size.  I just thought you'd be like, you know, like from like the Netherlands, like those, like  a Dutch guy on the beach.  It's not even underwear, it's more of a cock pouch.  Yeah, a marble bag.  It's all hog.  It's all hog.  All materials for his hog. 
[03:57:30]  His little wrinkled knees and no muscles.  There's nothing worse than going to the Caribbean or a fucking cruise where the guys jump in  the pool and it's just, he's wearing, just something covering his fucking nutsack.  Yeah.  Please rub it.  String up his ass.  He's got his kids with him.  No, you can always tell a European too because they have no hair.  Really?  No hair on their legs.  Study this?  They got no hair.  Nothing.  Americans we have hair.  All right, we're going.  We're going.  We got to go.  Where are we?  What?  What do we got to do?  You got to do.  You got to do. 
[03:58:00]  I got to do a thing.  We got to do an interview thing.  Bob Kelly, what do we got?  Stress Factory next week.  What is it?  The third?  732-545-4242.  That's 732-545.  Ha ha ha.  Not this coming weekend, of course, because Bob's in Boston with us at the Worcester Center  in the D.C. Center in Worcester.  But the week after that, he'll be at the Stress Factory in New Jersey Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Just go to MySpace, Bob Kelly.  Yeah, hit it up.  And I got to say, I've seen Bob Kelly many times. 
[03:58:30]  You know, he's warmed up for Dane Cook for a really long time.  He absolutely kills.  And this is his time, so go and support Bob Kelly.  Thank you very much.  That's right.  He's a piece of shit in real life, but a very funny guy.  It's his time.  I'm telling you, it's his time, and you should support Bob Kelly if he comes to your area.  He's amazing.  You really are, Bob.  Thank you, buddy.  Got to step out of character for a second.  You're killing it.  Wait a minute.  It's your time.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Greg Opie Hughes, or Greg Hughes, I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's more like...  Greg Opie.  It was kind of Greg Opie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He didn't step completely. 
[03:59:00]  That was Greg Hughes auditioning to play the part of Opie.  Exactly.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  Thanks, Adam.  Yeah.  Saturday night.  Saturday night.  Yeah, tickets still remain.  And we're broadcasting live from BCN on Friday.  Oh!  So, uh...  Oh!  That's how we end today, I guess.  Wow, across America.  True tales from the road.  Real evil, real stories, real boo.  Just got wowed on Highway 75, driving up from Florida, headed to Minnesota, about 10 minutes 
[03:59:30]  ago, getting close to Lake City.  Nice, round set of titties with some nice silver dollar nipples.  I just got wowed in Illinois, about 11.20 last night, by a black Escalade.
