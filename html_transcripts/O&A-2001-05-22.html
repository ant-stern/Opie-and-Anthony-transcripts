<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with rambling, nonsensical chatter before launching into a contest for NSYNC tickets, the prize being a "tar and feathering" (using honey) – a caller named Lola agreed to participate.  The show then fielded listener calls, including one about a peculiar aversion to sticky substances and another about mess-free self-pleasure. A significant portion was dedicated to crude jokes about Monica Lewinsky's semen-stained dress and its potential value.  The discussion then turned to the upcoming in-studio appearance of Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx from Mötley Crüe, referencing anecdotes from their autobiography, "The Dirt," focusing on their drug use, poor hygiene, and bizarre sexual encounters. Callers shared their own Mötley Crüe-related stories, including a graphic anecdote involving a telephone receiver. A large portion of this early segment focused on the plight of "Stinky," whose 63-year-old gay roommate viewed child pornography extensively in their shared kitchen, often in his underwear, and allegedly used Stinky's laundry inappropriately.  The hosts and callers expressed serious concern for Stinky's safety and discussed a discovered link to a Danish pedophile association website.

The show continued with a further exploration of Stinky's desperate search for a new roommate, prompting numerous humorous and vulgar calls. Callers shared their own roommate horror stories, contributing to the sexually charged atmosphere.  Graphic descriptions of sexual acts were frequent, alongside homophobic and misogynistic slurs. The hosts played audio of Stinky's roommate's activities.  Calls included “Gay Marco” detailing his underwear-stealing from a straight roommate, a 17-year-old girl, Kristen, initially offering sexual favors for NSYNC tickets and later revealing her father's cancer (prompting insensitive comments), and a caller claiming information on Paul Lynde's death.  Jesse, seeking a roommate, was briefly interviewed, and Triple H from the WWF called to promote the show.  Numerous Stacker 2 commercials aired.

The show then transitioned to advertising Auto-Lock Pro and Ultimate V, with crude demonstrations and language.  Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx from Mötley Crüe arrived, promoting "The Dirt." Their conversation detailed extreme drug use, sexual exploits, and debauchery, including a dildo and money challenge that Opie and Anthony planned to adapt.  Pornographic actress Jewel Denial participated in the "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge," a sexually suggestive game.  The conversation remained highly vulgar and sexually explicit, including racial, homophobic, and misogynistic slurs.

The Mötley Crüe segment detailed numerous outrageous stories from their past, including incidents with ping pong balls, a turntable, and various sexual encounters in Japan. They also discussed their touring experiences, drug use (including mainlining whiskey), and a listener's girlfriend leaving a concert with another woman.  Listener calls continued, sharing outlandish sex, drug, and host-related anecdotes, including one caller's account of a three-generation sexual encounter for a large sum of money. Jewel Denial described her explicit films, "Anal Sluts" and "Cream-Filled Sluts."  The conversation included explicit descriptions of sexual acts, positions, and unusual sexual experiences, mentioning a vibrating item and various fetishes.  SoBe beverages and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed were advertised, and future segments, "Lesbian for a Day" and the "Motley Crue Challenge," were discussed. The show ended with continued discussion of "The Dirt" and the band’s book signing.

Oh, Sandy Kate?  Are you right?  Yeah, we've got to get her back in.  We can get Sandy Kate on the phone.  It's not fun on the phone.  We've got to get her in the studio.  Check that hemorrhoid out.  I don't know if there's anything else we could do to the poor lady.  We've done it all.  She's the best one-trick pony around.  We've got some guy in here to apply some more prep H. All right.  Well, Anthony, it's time now.  We've got to get her back in.  We've got to get her back in. 
[00:02:00]  We've got to get her back in.  We've got to get her back in.  We've got to get her back in and push her back in.  We've got to get her back in.  We've got to get her back in.  We've got to get the best one-trick pony around.  We've got some guy in here to apply some more prep H. All right.  Well, Anthony, it's time to plaster some smiles on our faces and run through this crap one  more time for everyone.  Go ahead, Dan.  I love that.  It's a big slide.  I'm going to slap a smile on my face and plow through this S one more time.  Wonderful.  I have no problem.  I have no problems.  I have no problems.  Nothing at all. 
[00:02:30]  Do you have problems today?  No.  Of course not.  Fun day.  Kind of weird walking down the hall from our office to the studio.  How come the uncomfortable walk to the studio is getting more uncomfortable every day?  I don't know.  I mean, it used to be, it's like, hey, pop in and say hi to people as you're walking down the hall.  Yeah.  There used to be some people you'd pass, and it was cool.  Now that number's dwindling, and I don't know.  It's not a fun place anymore.  It's fine.  But we're having fun. 
[00:03:00]  It's an okay place.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people I like around here.  Yeah.  Just the walk's getting a little uncomfortable.  Walk's a little uncomfortable.  A lot of people wondering.  Yeah, a lot of people.  That's included.  Yeah.  All right.  Lola has to get on the air immediately, she said.  Lola.  Yeah, because I'm in my office, and I don't want to get in trouble.  What's up, Lola?  I called yesterday.  Yes, we know the void.  Oh, you're the Debbie Moore girl.  Yes.  Yes.  I thought of something.  For the NSYNC tickets, right?  Yes.  All right, let me just explain. 
[00:03:30]  We're, once again, playing Mommy.  What would you do for NSYNC tickets?  Yes.  That I'm a sister.  Doing it for my sister.  Same thing.  Yeah.  It's okay.  You got a little sister.  You want to make her happy with NSYNC tickets.  Only she can't know, you know, anything about how this goes.  Right.  And how old is your sister again?  She's 13.  13.  That's right.  Nice.  Okay.  So, sister, what would you do for the NSYNC tickets?  I was thinking like an old fish and tar and feather type thing.  Tar and feather?  Only with like honey.  Oh.  Oh, come on.  Everyone knows, Opie.  I have a pet peeve and it's sticky. 
[00:04:00]  I hate being sticky.  And even watching someone being sticky freaks me out.  Do you ever get, like if for some reason you got honey, you put it in your tea and you  get a little on your finger.  Yeah.  And you bend your finger and on the inside of your knuckle it sticks, drives me batty.  Worse than you with a vacuum.  Or at least par right on that level.  I hate sticky.  What if you like grab a tree back and get some sap?  Tree sap?  Sap.  Horrible.  And when I was working in construction, a lot of the two by fours that they cut to frame 
[00:04:30]  out a house, there's sap running off of them.  So I grab a beam and I have sap on the inside knuckle.  Horrific.  Can't take it.  Or the, I remember being a kid and a bunch of kids are eating ice cream or whatever it  is and you drip some on the chair and I sit down and you get sticky behind your kneecap.  Holy smoke, drive me batty.  I remember that one.  So what happens though?  You just kind of, I hate sticky.  You hate sticky.  I don't really like sticky either.  That's kind of why I was suggesting. 
[00:05:00]  I mean, I hate it where just watching you with honey on you will freak me out.  Well, that means Lola's got to get her ass down here.  Now, it's a torn feather bikini with honey and what else?  I don't know.  Something that will stick to the honey.  Something like?  Not like something nasty like dog food or something like that.  Something that would stick like feather-like.  Yeah.  You got some grooming going on downstairs?  I have a wood floor, baby.  Wood floor?  Why don't we just use feathers?  Why don't we get a down pillow, rip it open and just pour feathers on it?  All right.  We'll tar and feather you, Lola. 
[00:05:30]  Yay.  When do you want to do this?  Well, I'm going away on Thursday.  When are you having contestants come in?  We can start today, tomorrow.  Can I do it after Memorial Day?  Oh, my God.  Well, okay.  Then you're going to have to hold if we give you an address.  All right.  Maybe tomorrow.  I'm kidding.  Come on.  Can't we just have fun?  Whee.  I like the idea.  It's going to freak me out.  But, well, okay. 
[00:06:00]  We can put you on hold, I guess.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  See how the contest goes.  All right?  Cool.  Thanks.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  This guy, Jerry, doesn't understand it.  Line four.  What?  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  What?  Can you share with us the technique of pleasuring yourself without getting any sticky on you?  That's not sticky.  What do you call it?  It's not sticky.  It's slippery.  Slippery?  Yeah.  If you leave it on there, it gets sticky.  Well, who leaves it on, you freak?  Well, how long do you want to wait?  What's the time limit on it? 
[00:06:30]  I don't know.  It's slippery and sticky.  I don't lay there in my own mess.  What do you do?  I'm just going to wait.  I'm going to wait until the wind blows it away.  Check out my man-showder.  Yeah.  Look at it.  I'm just going to sit here and watch it.  Yeah.  You're done and you're done.  You know, you wait long enough.  It kind of just disappears and flakes away.  Flakes away?  What the fuck you got?  All right, Jerry.  No.  Clean up.  It's not stinky. 
[00:07:00]  You know, I had a really good friend.  His pet peeve was cotton and aspirin jars.  Cotton?  Could not take the cotton out of the little aspirin jars.  Would it freak him out?  Aspirin bottles or whatever.  Oh, yeah.  He couldn't touch the cotton?  It's fuzzy.  You've met Buzzy?  Yeah.  He's a freak.  He's a raging alcoholic and gets a lot of hangovers and needs his aspirin but can't  get the aspirin because of the cotton in the aspirin bottles.  Is it the act of taking it out of the bottle or he doesn't like touching cotton?  Cannot touch cotton.  Oh.  Cannot touch it.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Cotton freaks me out a little bit.  Like, I don't like the texture of it.  I sound weird.  I know.  But I don't like it.  And tearing cotton freaks me out.  You know, what's my favorite package on?  I get Gibby Gibby's.  Chewing on tinfoil.  Love it.  Anyone else?  What?  No?  Oh.  Yeah, that's bad.  That hurts.  That's pain.  That's not like a pet peeve.  That's pain.  Hey, kids, if you've never tried chewing on tinfoil, grab a little piece.  Try it today.  Roll it up into a wall.  Put it in your mouth and throw it. 
[00:08:00]  I can't even say it.  Oh.  A chef wants to tar and feather Lola.  Scott.  Yeah?  What are you going to do to help Lola out?  Well, in the restaurant business, a tar and feathering is either honey or melted chocolate.  Then you throw some shredded coconut on them.  That's too nice.  I wouldn't think that it would have feathers to keep it all runnable.  No, it should be feathers.  I'd love to see her looking like a big chicken.  Yeah, we're thinking honey.  We'll make the honey bikini, and then we'll just throw the feathers at her and see what happens. 
[00:08:30]  But who's going to eat it off of her?  No one's going to eat it.  She's going to have to get it off of her somehow.  I don't know.  Sounds like something for the lesbian cat.  It's going to give me the heebie-jeebies.  I know that.  Yeah, Scott, we're going to have to pass on you.  It's going to be easier than that.  Just honey and feathers, and we're going to rock.  All right.  All right?  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Roy on 1027 WNNW.  Roy, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Roy.  Yo, I thought for sure we were going to get a best of today after that little melee yesterday. 
[00:09:00]  What?  What?  Oh, come on.  We're just having fun.  You don't know.  Oh, what?  The retarded Laverne and Shirley at the end of the show?  What are you talking about?  Yeah, that and a few other things that were going on.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I also have this.  The machine wasn't on the dump button too good there.  Roy, I don't know what you're talking about, but I also have this strange scar in my forehead today.  Like Planet of the A's.  Like you got the big shaved mark where it looks like a huge receding hairline. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And the big scar on it.  I just thought I lost a lot of hair overnight.  No?  You're trying to tell me this means something else?  This big sea scar?  You've cut up his brain!  I don't know what he's talking about.  You'll have kinship with that human?  Andy.  I know that man.  Hey.  Fellas, I've been with you from day one.  Hey, thanks.  Yeah, I just wanted to say I enjoyed last year's bikini contest at the Newark grounds. 
[00:10:00]  The Newark bikini contest?  The softball.  Yeah, okay, okay, sure.  Right, so chances are if you're not, let's say, incognito two weeks from now, chances are no gang this year?  Ah, let's do it.  Let's just move forward and see what happens.  All right.  Let's take it like the drunks do, one day at a time.  That's right.  Yes, and also, when you described the last couple of days walking down the studios.  That is very strange.  That's eerie.  I feel like I have relatives that died in gas chambers in Auschwitz, and that's the depiction that you give. 
[00:10:30]  Well, it's bad.  I'll give it that.  It's uncomfortable, but I don't think you can compare it to walking to your death.  But it just sounds, you have villains, and you don't know where you're going to get shot.  Although I did see Ken Stevens goose-stepping his way to our office.  A thing.  You're being a thing.  A theater thing.  I wouldn't call it that bad.  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  All right.  Hey, speaking of sticky stuff. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  We should say into the Monica Lewinsky.  Yes, yes, of course, Monica.  She wants her semen-stained gap blue dress back.  Her blue dress.  Yeah, how are they describing it?  Here it is.  Monica wants her semen-stained dark navy high-neck number from the gap back.  It wasn't returned to her.  Well, it was evidence, as we all know, Anthony.  Yeah, of course.  The Interstate Counsel's office has been holding it for many years now. 
[00:11:30]  And it's her lawyer's position.  She's entitled to have all her possessions back, including the dress.  And it could fetch $500,000.  Half a mil.  As a collectible.  And is it still there?  Did they cut it out when they did the DNA testing?  I would think, why would you want the dress back?  Because I think they just cut a big swatch of the sploods out of it.  I would like the semen swatch.  That's the important thing, not the dress, as much as where he dribbled. 
[00:12:00]  Because, you know, he wasn't having sex.  And he said he doesn't finish, or he never finished with Monica.  Remember his testimony?  Yeah.  He said he didn't finish, but he kind of dribbled.  He dribbled.  He kind of took it out a little prematurely, or left it in a little long.  You know how that is.  I can hold it.  I can hold it.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  It's past the point of no return.  And then there you go.  It's exhibit A.  Someone run around the side of the house and turn off the nozzle. 
[00:12:30]  You can't turn off the nozzle.  Once you reach the point, it's over, Johnny.  But even when you turn off the hose, it's, you know, it just...  Do we know where the sting was on the dress?  Um, right under the collar.  That's where I'm at.  Right all over those big, luscious Monica Lewinsky cans.  That's what I'm assuming.  And they were sitting up there.  And now she wants it back.  But it's got to have the big hole cut in it, where they do that testing. 
[00:13:00]  How funny would it be if she just, like, got the dress back and just started walking the streets of New York with a semen-stained dress?  That would...  Imagine seeing Monica.  Not only seeing Monica, but then seeing her in that dress?  Oh, that would be fascinating.  Everyone would want to come up and look at the stain, take pictures with it.  Have a picture.  Not with you so much.  It's okay.  I just want a picture with the Clinton splooge stain.  Nice.  Nice.  And it's kind of flaked away already.  That doesn't last.  It's pretty...  It's got to be gone. 
[00:13:30]  Johnny, what's going on?  How are you, Opie?  How's everything?  Everything's good, Johnny.  I'm just curious.  This is Buzz guy, your friend?  Buzzy, yeah.  My friend or Anthony's friend?  It's my college friend, but sure, he's a friend of mine as well.  Is he a black guy?  Why would he be a black guy?  Oh, maybe you have to have a pair of cotton for that, you know.  Oh.  Oh, there you go.  The first racial floor of the day.  Okay, nice.  Only because my friend, Buzzy, hates to pull the cotton out of the aspirin bottle. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  That's why Earl always has a headache.  He can't take the exception.  That's awful.  New from Spunko.  It's the president's favorite toy.  It's the Lewinsky.  Who aims to please while on her knees and makes a suckety sound.  Oh, ah.  A slut.  A slut.  She looks like a mutt.  Everyone knows Lewinsky.  Lewinsky.  Lewinsky.  Lewinsky.  Her mouth is a wonderful toy. 
[00:14:30]  Lewinsky.  Lewinsky.  She's fun for a horny old boy.  Hey, Mark.  What's going on?  You're next on WNAW.  Mark.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How are you, buddy?  Obviously, you guys aren't paying attention to your own show.  Why?  Doesn't it just flake away and go away?  Hey, we just said that.  We said that.  Yeah, but on the dress?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, that'd be gone on the dress.  Then you get that little telltale sign that something was there, I think.  Or if it flaked away off her chin, too. 
[00:15:00]  Kind of like how, you know, like mayonnaise kind of goes away, but it still has that, like,  kind of a ring.  A little ring of a grease stain, kind of.  Yeah, you could kind of tell something was there.  Right.  Very nice.  And you could potentially clone a Clinton with that.  Right?  Sure.  It's DNA.  Catfish, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  Clinton called.  He wants his semen back.  Hey, does anybody know the half-life on that stuff?  On Sluge?  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:15:30]  Probably get our DNA out of it for quite a while.  Yeah, we could have a whole bunch of little slick willies running around.  Yeah, we could have a contest.  Someone could figure out the half-life of semen.  Yeah, sure.  That's going to take a while to go away.  All right, and we're just getting started.  We got Vince Neal and Nikki Sixx coming in today from Motley Crue.  Yeah.  Yeah, their autobiography is twisted.  I bet they have stains on a lot of dresses around the country.  Oh, shoot.  Could you get my notes from the book?  Yeah.  Some of the things we've got to talk about. 
[00:16:00]  Books.  It's a really good autobiography.  Dude, these guys are just out of their effing minds and pictures.  The book's called The Dirt, Motley Crue.  Yeah.  And it's a great read.  These guys live the life.  The rock star life.  Yeah.  I think you get my notes, but they tell a story in the book how, how could I put this lightly?  They stuck their you-know-whats in burritos to get the smell of off their... 
[00:16:30]  Why would they have to get the smell off?  Ah, that's a good question.  Where's Steve from FoundryMusic.com?  He's got the answer to that question.  Other girls they had to go to?  I think it would be a little more suspicious.  I think it smells like a burrito.  Steve, the burrito story.  Hey, go over there, over there, over there.  They stuck their junk in burritos.  I think it was an egg burrito, actually.  It was an egg burrito.  I think they just had other skanks to go after. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, so they didn't want the...  Right.  Well, keep in mind that they're all teenagers living in a cockroach-infected apartment in Los Angeles in the early 80s,  and they're not exactly flowing over with brain cells.  Why wouldn't they just watch?  Scrub it.  The description of their bathroom.  They never bought toilet paper.  They were wiping themselves with flyers.  No, no joke.  They didn't even have money for toilet paper, and they didn't empty the garbage.  It was just there.  Right.  It would just pile up on the front porch. 
[00:17:30]  They would just throw the garbage out of, like, the window of the kitchen or something into a patio area.  And then, like, the LAPD had to come down and then give them a summons because they had so much effing garbage piled out outside their house.  Right, Sting?  Right.  They would have magazines and socks where they'd wipe their butt with and just throw it in the corner of the bathroom.  This would be newspapers with crap on them.  This is the early days of Motley Crue, man.  That's rocking.  That is rocking.  That's living the rock star life. 
[00:18:00]  That's definitely rocking.  They didn't have enough money for toilet paper.  They used to date ugly chicks that worked in supermarkets so they could bring home groceries.  What are you thinking?  Yeah, they stuck their you-know-what's in burritos to get the smell off.  Nikki, of course, battled heroin addiction for many years.  When they wanted to come down from heroin, this was on Behind the Music, they would mainline alcohol into their veins.  That's to come down from the heroin.  Like you would just inject Jack Daniels into yourself or something? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, that was on Behind the Music, right?  It was on Behind the Music, yeah.  Oof.  How long does a shot take to hit you?  Obviously not long enough.  I mean, too long.  Mainlining the, yeah, the main-lining booze.  We'll have to ask you about that.  Things in Jack Daniels that kind of get filtered through your stomach and your digestive system.  I was wondering about that, too.  Just the stuff that should be in your blood is in your blood?  I would think your kidneys serve a function there.  Right.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  There's a filtration process that goes there.  That doesn't mean you can just take JD and put it right into your bloodstream.  Apparently nobody told them.  What a bunch of nuts.  Hey, the Motley Crue, were they the band, or were they on tour with Ozzy,  and they told it during the Motley Crue one, where Ozzy snorted the ants?  The ants.  Yeah, they were in a contest contest.  Yes, and they were on tour with Ozzy, and he went in.  What was it?  I think it was down south somewhere, and he went down, and there was a pile of ants around like a...  Like an ice cream cone. 
[00:19:30]  You know, a little ice cream melting on the sidewalk.  And you know how they walk in line.  Yeah.  And he picked up a line of ants and just...  Oh, you're going to snort some ants.  Well, Ozzy listens to our show.  Maybe he'll call in and tell us a little more about the snorting of the ants.  But there's a lot.  You haven't lived, do you snort insects?  There's a lot of things to ask the guys today.  Yeah.  I mean, they just...  They didn't hold back to this book at all.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  I'm calling from Brooklyn.  I'm friends with John Carabi. 
[00:20:00]  As you know, he was the former singer for Malacruz to the Vintage Place during the 80s.  Right.  And he told me once his really sick story, something that him and Tommy did,  and I'm curious to know if it's even mentioned in that book.  He told me that they were on tour, and they were in their hotel room,  and they had this girl up there.  She's like a real, real typical rock and roll skank, right?  Right.  And that they inserted the telephone receiver all the way into her,  and then they ordered rooms to the receiver. 
[00:20:30]  You know what?  Is that in the book?  All right.  Well, it's not, Steve.  I don't think so.  We tried that trick for Rick's birthday a year ago.  We tried it with a cell phone.  With a cell phone.  Ask Nicky and Vince, or even however, if they remember that story,  because I couldn't believe it when you told me that.  All right.  We'll write it down, and we'll ask them.  Thank you.  We ought to try that again.  I think it was just bad cell phones at the time, a couple of years back when we did that.  We had a girl come up, and we took a cell phone and put it in the most intimates. 
[00:21:00]  And then we tried to make a call.  We tried to call.  We tried to call the unt phone.  Right.  It was on vibrate for her pleasure.  Yeah.  And we called it up, but for some reason there's no service in there.  It says wait for service.  Well, you can't get service in tunnels, Anthony.  Cervix.  No cervix.  No cervix.  Joe.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I was watching it behind the music when it was on the Molly Crew, 
[00:21:30]  and Nicky Six told the story that he OD'd on heroin.  He went to the hospital.  He was clinically dead.  They revived him.  He checked himself out of the hospital that night, and he said he went home  and proceeded to shoot up the biggest shot of heroin he's ever taken in his life.  Yeah, I remember seeing that on TV.  He woke up, and there was blood in his hand, and his arm was all bruised.  It was crazy.  No, it was dry, caked on blood.  Oh, there's no one.  Tommy Lee and Nicky Six, they said they had a bet.  Who could go the longest without Charlene and still catch oral pleasure from a girl each day? 
[00:22:00]  He said that it went 30 days, and Tommy Lee said it got to the point.  And he got, like, one, if not three in a day, and he got to the point.  He said it can go on forever.  He said it got to be heinous.  I completely believe it, because you've got the rock skank hose, you know,  and they'll do anything to get close to their idols.  Oh, that is funny.  It's got to imagine how bad you stink after, like, playing all the time.  That's great.  Strike that one down, too.  We've got to ask him about this story.  Really bad.  That's cool.  Thanks, Joe.  All right, let it.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  That's hilarious.  Tommy!  Tommy!  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  The best part of that story you guys forgot, that when Ozzy sniffed that line of ants,  that was benefiting a drug-free concert in Europe over somewhere.  That's what the whole, the funniest part of the story was.  All these guys are drugging up, drugging up, and then they're going over and preaching  don't do drugs in Europe.  Right.  Crazy stuff.  Good luck, boys.  I'm going to talk to you soon.  Thanks, Tommy.  That's cool.  Well, they're going to, when are they coming?  Around 5 o'clock or so?  Well, that's going to be a lot of fun. 
[00:23:00]  If they open up as much as they did in their book, it'll be a good segment on the show today.  Cool.  Are they all dry now?  They don't know.  You reach a point where you've got to say enough is enough, huh?  More or less.  There's a rumor that they tour just to kind of help each other out financially.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's talked about in depth in the book.  Was it irresponsibility on their own part?  They're getting asked by record companies.  I can't see them getting asked.  They put out some major out.  It's a combination of both.  It's a combination of both. 
[00:23:30]  From what it says in the book, Vince has to pay.  He's paying for alimony or child support.  No, not child support.  Excuse me.  Alimony.  He's paying alimony.  Medical bills.  Medical bills.  For Skylar.  For Skylar, his daughter who passed away.  Right.  And a lot of the touring is to pay.  Oh, him and Mick pays for ex-wives, children, and a lot of the touring is to cover legal costs 
[00:24:00]  and medical bills and all kinds of stuff.  So after all of that, a lot of these guys don't have a whole lot of money.  We recommend the book.  Wow.  We've all been reading it for the last couple weeks, and there's some good stories in there.  That's amazing.  Okay.  Also, Mommy, don't forget.  Mommy, what will you do for NSYNC tickets?  Yeah, let's get this going.  The contest has begun.  We have a girl coming down, I don't know, in a week or so, to get tar and feather, a bikini  tar and feather.  Right.  All you have to do is come up with ideas for the NSYNC tickets.  Okay. 
[00:24:30]  See, she came up with a good idea.  Tar and feather.  We obviously can't use tar, but honey works just as well.  Who says we can't use tar?  Well, I think that's disgusting.  Tar would hurt.  I think, you know, everyone thinks of tar and feathering like the old cartoons, you  know, where all of a sudden the big keg of tar, Yosemite salmon, I'll get you,  rabbit.  You know, and the tar comes out, and then the big puff of feathers, and then the next  scene, you know, they're back to normal.  But I think when they used to actually do that, it was boiling hot tar. 
[00:25:00]  They would jump on you, and I think they just put the feathers on to make a real fool  of you as you died in the hot tar.  So, we couldn't use tar, Opie.  All right.  But boiling honey.  Yeah, we'll stick with the hot honey.  Yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Give us a ring.  What's the meaning of this striking line?  Somebody saw it now!  Whatever.  Opie and Anthony show.  A smorgasbord.  Opinion.  1-0-2-7.  The greatest radio I've ever heard. 
[00:25:30]  W-N-E-W.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W is...  The sports guys at 5 a.m.  The radio chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special Ron and Fez.  A dare goes too far.  Fez, I can't believe you tried to stunt like this.  You know how dangerous that was?  I have to prove that I could do it.  Well, you proved it.  You can still fit in a size 40 G's.  But if that button would have popped off, you could have killed somebody. 
[00:26:00]  Ronnie!  What?  Oh, ridiculous.  I think my intestines are running down my legs.  All on the next Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Anthony, New York Sports Club.  Yes, yes.  Early summer heat brought out a lot of bare legs, arms, midriffs,  and lots of reasons to join New York Sports Club.  Like Opie did.  Right?

[00:28:30]  Jewel Denial?  Jewel Denial.  Jewel Denial?  Daddy Kramer?  I don't know.  She's just some whore.  Wow.  And you're not even drunk today.  No, who is she really?  She's some porn shakes.  It's in Fox Magazine.  Fox.  Fox.  Fox.  Fox.  Fox Pornomag.  What's Fox Magazine?  Rick calls me and goes, I think we should get some girl for, you know, for the Motley  Crew guys.  So he goes, I call this chick.  So he throws me this magazine and here she is. 
[00:29:00]  Maybe the Motley Crew guys don't want to see any chick.  Yeah, you know, I think they've probably seen.  This girl?  What are they going to do with this girl?  Dude, they were getting hummers after not showering for a month.  Can we take a multiple times a day?  Why would they?  Wait, what a surprise.  Steve comes in.  Oh, I know who she is.  Let me talk.  Steve?  Steve always knows.  Our porno connection.  She's, I think, she's in one of the movies that I just got you guys the other day.  Slap Happy?  No, surprisingly enough, but it might be one of the four Slap Happys or the new one, 
[00:29:30]  which title I don't think I can say.  Well, I could say Cocktails.  Cocktails.  I can say Cocktails.  She's in Cocktails?  I think she's in Cocktails.  Stinky doesn't like Cocktails.  Is that the one with the champagne glasses and the wine glasses and the Brandy Smithers?  Yes.  Full of stuff and the girls are drinking stuff out of the wine glasses?  Stinky, he was deeply disturbed by Cocktails today.  Well, no crap.  Stinky, what was the problem today?  I was trying to show you something a little different.  Oh, there you go. 
[00:30:00]  And you had to leave the office.  It was disgusting.  It's not something you see every day, though.  Yeah, that gives you the heebie-jeebies.  She had a full glass when she was down in there.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And we were just about to get lunch.  All right.  Well, have we done our research on Jewel Denial?  Jewel Denial!  Look where she's sticking the chain, though.  My Lord.  Wait, wait, that is a huge, like, chain that you chain up a motorcycle with.  That's like a bike chain that you see on the streets of Manhattan. 
[00:30:30]  She's using it like what they call butt beads.  Yeah, but you know those things?  I don't know if this is a David Copperfield.  It looks like it's going in one way and coming out the other, but that's physically impossible, Opie.  I do believe it's one end going there and the other end going there.  Kind of a David Copperfield thing happening there?  Yes, like when he made the Statue of Liberty disappear, Opie.  Same principle.  Boy, what do you ask a girl that has a chain up her, you know what, up the sludge factory? 
[00:31:00]  I think our interviewing skills are going to be challenged today.  One end in the swamp.  One end in the sludge factory and the other in the whale's eye.  I sure hope that's galvanized.  That could cause some corrosion on the chain.  Where's Steve?  Maybe Steve should help us out with this.  Let me see her.  All right, here you go.  Here's Jewel Denial.  Is she coming in today? 
[00:31:30]  I mean, when?  Steve, is there anything we could ask the lovely Jewel Denial?  Well, maybe would she do that again?  Yeah, maybe she's bringing her bike chains, right?  Maybe.  I see a candidate for a wiffle ball back shower.  I think that's what Anthony looked at you.  A wiffle ball back shower.  Whoa.  Is this her right here?  Yeah.  Wow, look at her.  Suck that.  Jesus Christ.  You ever notice the heels always point toward the area?  Oh, yeah.  Always.  You could always find the area. 
[00:32:00]  Just follow the girl's heels.  No matter what position.  All right, so we got...  And what is this Fox magazine?  Never heard of the Fox magazine.  You know who bought it?  Mark buys it.  It's a hardcore porno.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  She's what they call a sprayer.  Okay, look, you know what?  Yeah.  We've got to get Sticky back in here.  But do you think the guy...  Because speaking of hardcore porno, he told me a story today that was kind of disturbing.  Are you allowed to talk about your roommate? 
[00:32:30]  Oh.  Kind of?  I don't care.  You don't care?  Ben, you've been to Sticky's place?  Oh, yeah.  I've been there to the Kid Toucher home.  By the way, we're going to just make a plea today.  Sticky needs, like, a cool place to live.  Yes.  He kind of lives with a Kid Toucher.  Oh, kind of?  Well, I'm trying to be polite because I don't know...  I don't want to get you in trouble, but Sticky doesn't have a lot of money, right, Anthony?  No.  You don't make money...  How did you get this place, first of all, Sticky?  The Village Voice just adds... 
[00:33:00]  Why would you look in the voice?  They were all the...  Yeah, but that's like the gay paper.  Oh, no, no.  No, there's a lot going on in the Village Voice.  Oh.  Oh, how's that for a top of a hole hole?  Village Voice is a very happening publication.  I know, but there is a lot of gay material in there.  Gay ads.  It's the best place in New York to find an apartment.  I will...  Yes.  I will guarantee that.  All right.  Well, who found their apartment?  Did Psycho Mark find his?  And he lives with a gay guy. 
[00:33:30]  No.  He found his?  He lives with a gay guy.  You live with a gay guy, right?  Yeah.  But like a weird gay guy.  Yeah, he's a schoolteacher, but...  Oh, my God.  He never leaves...  Okay, look.  Hold on.  Before you go any further, because I really do care about Sticky, I don't care if anyone  else destroys their lives by being on our show.  Yeah.  Sticky may need a place to stay after this segment.  What?  Does he listen?  He has no idea what you do, right?  He doesn't listen.  He knows what I do, but he has no idea.  He doesn't listen. 
[00:34:00]  Look at Ben Luton.  Just no names.  That's fine.  All right, so he's a teacher, and he's a gay guy.  And he just lives in the house.  He never leaves.  But he's a teacher?  Yeah.  I mean, he goes to work, but he comes right back, and...  I don't know.  He spends his whole...  Yeah.  He spends his free time on the Internet, Anthony.  On the Internet.  Not just an hour here, hour there.  You're talking...  Like, six, seven hours.  Well, I got to be honest now.  I spend a lot of time on the computer because I'm into online gaming. 
[00:34:30]  So, Stinky, I spend hours on the computer maybe playing EverQuest.  Well...  So, is he an online gamer, Stinky?  Unless Danish pedophile pages are online games.  Danish pedophile pages.  This is the story he told me today.  Danish pedophile pages.  He hangs out, and what, the computer is in the...  The kitchen.  In the kitchen area, so you can't help but notice that your roommate's on the computer  in his underwear at all hours of the day, right? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Dude, the kitchen...  Do you know what goes on in front of monitors when people are looking at porn sites?  They're not looking at him to just, like, get info.  He's spanking it in your kitchen.  Not according to him.  He said he was just roaming around on the web and looking at...  He's throwing web is what he's doing.  Like Spider-Man out of his wrist.  Oh, my God.  The guy's cranking it in your kitchen.  Well, first of all, Anthony, his computer screen, according to Stinky, remember that South 
[00:35:30]  Park episode where Cartman, you know, I'm a 12-year-old.  And it goes, and bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  IMs.  IMs like crazy, right?  All the time.  Yeah, so you were walking by, what, last night?  Or was this this morning?  What, with the pedophile page?  Yeah, the Danish pedophile page.  Over the weekend, and I had a question about the computer, and he closed the window, and  I didn't see what it was.  Yes, instantly closed that window.  But then two minutes later, he goes, oh, I was on a Danish pedophile page. 
[00:36:00]  And then I had to try to play it off like, it was like, oh, yeah.  Do you know why?  He probably thought you saw it anyway.  So now he's going to fess up and tell you that he was on a Danish pedophile page.  But it just makes it sound so casual, like, yeah, everyone's been to Yahoo.  Yeah, I've been to the Danish pedophile page.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  What Danish pedophile page in Yahoo right now?  I defy you to find an actual Danish pedophile page.  You've got to work at something like that.  That's what I told Stinky.  I'm like, how would you even go about finding a Danish pedophile website?  There's no basement or crawl spaces in this place, is there? 
[00:36:30]  Except where I sleep.  No, like, underground where there's a dirt floor maybe covered with lime?  Stinky's room is laughing like that.  Stinky's room is supposedly the size of his mattress.  And Frank is hysterical laughing at the size of where Stinky's got to sleep.  He sleeps on, it's a little loft in the same bedroom as the gay guy?  Yeah.  So you're up how high?  Five feet?  You're five feet up in your bed.  And he's down below? 
[00:37:00]  No, no.  There's two lofts in the bedroom.  And he has, like, a queen-size bed.  Queen.  On the north side of the...  And then my bed...  So can you see his bed from your bed?  No, there's curtains.  Oh, yes.  That's good.  Curtains stop a world of hurt.  That'll protect you from a pedophile.  I'm sure he hasn't peered in the curtains.  Oh, come on.  Well, think about it.  The guy's being his pedophile page, you know?  How old the guy is he?  63. 
[00:37:30]  Whoa, revelation right there.  I thought you were talking about a guy maybe in his 40s or 50s or something.  63.  He's an old ped.  And he has kids, and he had a wife, and everything.  Yeah, he's going to change.  He lived in the south, and I think he just found out he was gay and moved up to New York.  Well, you've got to do that when you're gay.  You've got to move up north.  But he never leaves his abode, huh?  Never.  He's constantly there.  And he'll turn on the stove just so he can sit in the kitchen with just his underwear on,  like just so it's hot enough in there. 
[00:38:00]  We've got to help.  There's an old man cranking it to Danish kid porn in your kitchen.  In your kitchen.  And, boy, you know, the New York City apartments are so big,  you can just go to another part of the apartment and get away from them.  Oh, Jesus.  Why are there egg whites on my sandwich?  Oh, my good gosh.  And I've checked out his recent document folders, and it's not pretty.  Just the videos. 
[00:38:30]  It's like, oh.  Recent documents.  What have you found on there?  It's always, like, Daddy, title Daddy something.  It'll be just like this little boy or something.  Holy smoke.  The love me, Daddy website.  Wow.  There is a felony waiting in your kitchen, man.  And I can't believe you see the kids, too.  Oh, that's obvious.  A lot of pedophiles get into lines of work.  They put them around children.  Yeah, I mean, if you were into feed, wouldn't you work at a shoe store? 
[00:39:00]  Right.  Very good, old kid.  Very good analogy.  You know, a lot of people are like the soccer coach guy.  Watch all the kid touching movies on the after-school special.  They're all soccer coaches and teachers.  Oh.  Benny's teaching them something.  I bet.  I think he needs to move on.  You've got to get out of there.  Where do you want to live, Stan?  Because a lot of people say they've got a place in Long Island.  But you want to stay in the city?  Yeah, you want to stay in the city?  Do you share a shower with this guy?  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  At the same time?  Calm down, Ben.  You share a shower.  So, now, is he using your soap and whatnot?  No, we have different.  Sure, because it's like that Jay Moore bit, you know?  Have you looked around for holes in the bathroom door or, like, things?  Dude, because this guy is...  Now, how old are you?  23.  You're 23.  So, to a guy his age, you're a kid.  Yeah.  So, I mean, and you're living with him.  You're showering with him. 
[00:40:00]  This is like...  I would look for holes in the door.  Maybe that he can peer in at you as you're showering.  He's got spy cams.  The bathroom, the walls in the bathroom, all are in different apartments, like the other  side of it.  What about the door?  Yeah.  Is there a drop ceiling in your house?  Is there tile ceiling that can be pushed up?  No, no.  And you know a lot about this.  I know everything, my friend.  Yeah.  I pride myself on knowing, instead of specializing in one area, I know a lot. 
[00:40:30]  I know a little bit about a lot of things.  Right?  That's what I try to do.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  I saw in today's New York Times, it even looked appealing to me, in the Metro Circuit section,  HUD puts an S, because they have to, for low-income housing.  And I saw apartments, I swear to God, one bedroom, so $515.  But the only thing is, stinky.  I think this will be perfect for you, because you have to make under $23,000 a year.  Do you make under $23,000?  Yeah, he's right around there. 
[00:41:00]  Take a look in today's Times, I'm serious.  Because I was thinking about putting, they said on West 42nd Street.  And now, I mean, that would be perfect for you.  All right.  All right, Kevin, thank you.  Good luck.  We'll take a look at that, all right?  Bye.  All right, Benny from the NYPD.  Benny!  Yeah?  Hey.  Hey, this one, why didn't he report him to the local squad where he's at, man?  He'd go to jail for that kiddie porn.  Why does he want to send his roomie to jail?  Who cares, man? 
[00:41:30]  We don't need little kiddie porn pornographers running around.  He's got to come up with his half of the rent.  All right, to hell with him.  All right, thank you.  All right.  He's cranking it on his side of the room to see if he can hit Stinky's face.  Look at the Nambla newsletter, Stinky.  They've got a pretty good classified section.  What does Stinky live with Jim Norton?  That's Dan from Hobo, too.  Very good.  Lewis.  Oh, my God, Stinky.  I can't believe you're living in this environment. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, Stinky, I'm just curious.  Do you ever wake up feeling like sharp pains in your ass?  A lot of people have wondered that, Stinky.  Has he made any moves on you?  Not at all, honestly.  Have you woken up maybe like 2 o'clock in the afternoon one night where you went to bed early that night?  And for some reason you don't know, you're still drowsy.  Maybe you're feeling a slippery feeling where you shouldn't feel.  Not at all.  My God.  Because I hate when that happens.  No, huh? 
[00:42:30]  No, no.  You've got to get out of there, though.  That sounds like a situation you're putting yourself in that could also jeopardize you as far as maybe going to jail or being an accessory.  Do you use the computer?  No, he has passwords up.  You have passwords up the one?  Because I think even being a roommate in that house that has that material in the house, you're kind of liable for it.  You better watch out.  You better watch out.  So, Stinky, all right, you leave work, and what happens?  You go home.  Do you talk to your roommate? 
[00:43:00]  He's already in bed.  He can't talk when he's sucking his what?  What do you mean he's in bed at what time?  7.30, 8 o'clock, he's in bed.  And then he'll wake up at 1 or 2 in the morning.  Yes.  You know, because that's when all the pedophiles...  The best time to troll for kid porn.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  Does he have shopping bags to put the little children in in the bathroom stall?  Wait, so this guy...  So when the cops look underneath, they only see you sitting on the bowl in a shopping bag?  Wait, wait.  You know, he touched on something, though.  Yeah, well, he's better not touch it again. 
[00:43:30]  He goes to bed early so he can be wide awake at 1 or 2 in the morning when he's...  Yeah, when all the...  The yanks are open.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  And you know that yam...  60-some-odd-year-old yam bags just hit in the kitchen, linoleum.  I mean, oh.  Wow.  I really just stay up in my bed and watch TV and don't go down at all.  Stinky, what made you take this?  Like, did you have a couple of options?  No.  You looked at this and said, okay, this is the one I'll take? 
[00:44:00]  Well, I was living on my friend's couch for two weeks.  Yeah.  And I'm kind of tired and I looked at two or three places and he was the only one that  accepted me.  Yeah, because everybody else probably went like, yeah, accepted.  I want a young boy.  Yes, young boy.  Hello.  Accepted.  That's like...  Yes, Stinky, I've been looking over all the two of you, yes.  Do you like to know who you are here?  Warning, Stinky, run for your life.  Cover your anus. 
[00:44:30]  Cover your anus.  Please be quiet, sir.  I have to sleep so I can wake up at one and throw the net for young boy.  Oh, dear.  Stinky, could you help me here?  Yes, young boy.  Major West, I'm on the computer.  And the messages on the answering machine, there's a whole guy.  And I don't know where he lives.  Ding dong.  Right.  He's always talking about time differences. 
[00:45:00]  He's like, just call me back, please.  I need to talk to you.  I have to get your address.  I'm calling back in ten minutes.  And you'll see, like on the caller ID, eight calls in a row in ten minutes from this guy  trying to talk to him about whatever.  I'll call you right back.  Talk to me a little bit about your rosy red boy, but it's a secret.  Are you ready?  That's funny that you said he accepted you.  Oh, God.  Wow. 
[00:45:30]  That's like I'm looking for a roommate or something, right?  And a Playboy model shows up.  Right.  That's what it was when he walked in.  Without a doubt.  Oh, my goodness gracious, this is wonderful, yes.  Young stinky.  Let me guess, Ben's having a hell of a time laughing at all.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mark.  You're having an angry minute.  Without a doubt.  It's more funnier than when someone from this show is living with a kid toucher. 
[00:46:00]  You know, Mark.  Young stinky.  Oh, yeah, sure.  No problem.  Nine-year-old boys abound in my apartment all the time.  Yeah, you're in kind of a similar situation.  Well, your old gay guy is in his bed.  No, it's a totally different situation.  He's not into the children.  No, he's not into anything, okay?  And they don't share a bedroom with the guy.  Yeah, but he prances around, though, Mark, and he's got statues and stuff.  Who kids?  Who kids?  He has a thousand statues.  I don't sleep in the same room and share a shower with him. 
[00:46:30]  Look at what page I'm on right now, OK?  I'm on the Danish Pedophile Association page.  Yes, at Copenhagen, Denmark.  Turn that around.  Turn that around.  What?  Oh, God.  There it is.  The scariest part of this is a listener just sent the link.  He found it.  That's scary.  Let's see what they got.  Hmm.  Yes, OK, disclaimers.  It's like a discussion formed frequently asked questions. 
[00:47:00]  What is Danish Pedophile Association?  Well, let's get the answer to that.  All right.  Let me pop that up.  To inform the public and reduce prejudice against pedophilia.  What?  Children's sexuality and voluntary emotional and sexual relationships between children and adults.  It's spelt out like a charter for the Lions Club or something.  To establish social contact and support for persons who have emotional, sexual, juridical, or social problems related to pedophilia. 
[00:47:30]  It's pedophilia.  It's a pedo support group, which is nice that they have that to go to.  What's next, KidTouches.com?  Save the children from Save the Children.  What?  This is like Bizarro page.  Newsletter.  Tax and fiction about child pornography.  Holy smoke.  There's graphs and everything on this page. 
[00:48:00]  What do you mean graphs?  There's a graph.  Offenses.  Of sexual abuse of children.  Oh, it's on the down.  Well, thank God for that.  And it's all due to the Danish Pedophile Association, I'm sure.  Thank you.  Jay from Jersey wants to know if your roommate owns a bicycle shop like the guy from Different Stokes.  Me and Sam are going to get locked around.  And Troy from Jersey. 
[00:48:30]  Stinky, your roommate gets up at one in the morning because that's the time when all kids get home from school in Denmark.  Yeah.  Well, that is.  What time is it in Denmark when it's one in the morning here?  It's prime time for the kiddies.  Probably.  Nice.  All right.  You've never gotten high with this guy, have you?  No, not at all.  No.  Does he drink?  No.  No.  He's kind of religious.  I don't know.  Well, of course.  Don't you picture, like, a real run-down, dark, dank place with the gas stove on, just a flickering blue light, 
[00:49:00]  this old pedo sitting in front of his goddamn computer, and there's Stinky Watson.  Hi.  Hi, I'm home.  I'm going to go to my cubicle now.  Jesus Christ.  The bed in the escape pod in Aliens got more room than you.  The poor guy's sitting in a box with a pedo on the web, cranking it where he eats. 
[00:49:30]  Run away.  Run.  Run away as fast as you can.  Stinky's like a veal.  Yeah.  They're like a veal.  Hey, Stinky.  If you turn him in, then you'll get the whole place to yourself.  Is there a red neon light blinking hotel, hotel, hotel?  No?  Nothing like that?  Because I picture that, too.  No, so flashing this sign that says KT, KT, KT.  My hands are full of Stinky.  I've got my mouse and keyboard in one hand.  Could you please gently touch me? 
[00:50:00]  Woo!  Thank God it's not me today.  Please call yourself Billy Moomy.  Could you do that, please, Stinky?  Woo!  Oh, God.  Danish pedo page.  Stinky, you've got to leave.  Yeah.  How long have you been there for?  You've been there, what?  Since November.  Oh.  This is a cry for help.  Stinky really needs to get the hell out of there. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, let's really help him out.  I mean, for God's sake, I think we got Stalker Patty a place.  And I think we could help Stinky out.  Who would have ever thought that Stalker Patty lives better than our own Stinky?  We should compare Stinky's living arrangement with Stalker Patty's.  All right, Psycho Mark, we're going to let you go.  A bunch of people want in on this one today.  Let's get in.  Let's get in.  All right, thank you, brother.  I'm with a kid toucher, too.  Jay, what's going on?  Jay, turn that off.  Turn the radio off. 
[00:51:00]  Turn the radio off, man.  Let's go.  Jay.  Yeah.  Let's go.  What do you got, man?  I got a friend of mine who was a girl.  She's like about 25 years old.  And she went down to get a job down in D.C.  so she wasn't making too much money.  And she ended up getting an apartment with some old guy.  A guy was like 75 years old.  And one day she just comes home, finds a guy dead, naked, though, right outside of her room.  Dead and naked.  Dead and naked. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, what a better way to be found.  That's a nice way to be found.  Dead, naked, in front of your computer?  Yeah.  Supposedly they found Paul N.  Dead and naked.  He died pleasuring himself.  Oh, did he swear?  When I took that Graveline tour in L.A., we drove by his house and they said he died naked pleasuring himself.  The center square, Paul Lynn to block.  Maybe this guy wasn't pleasuring himself.  Maybe someone out there has the full story on Paul Lynn. 
[00:52:00]  Help us out today.  Oh, no, erotic asphyxiation.  That's what I think it was, Anthony.  Yeah.  Have I choked in myself and the chicken?  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  He's stinky.  No.  Good.  I don't want to freak you out or anything, man, but...  Why don't you want to make a bet the guy's walking around with your underwear, like, stuck through your face?  Oh, shit!  Do you have dirty laundry?  What about your laundry?  Yeah, I have dirty laundry.  And what do you want to do? 
[00:52:30]  Do you send it out?  Do you wash it yourself?  No, I bring it to a place, yeah.  You bring it to a place?  But some of your dirty laundry right now is sitting where?  In a hamper, right on the knee.  No, it's sitting on his head.  In a hamper where?  Right underneath where our beds are.  Right underneath where your guys' beds are.  So this guy, at any time, can reach in, pull out a 22-year-old guy's underwear.  That's potpourri for those guys.  Oh, God.  It's like blue velvet.  Potpourri!  I think he's underwear looks like a shoeshine rag, and the guy's got it on his head. 
[00:53:00]  And they're going, Bobby.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Listen to my voice.  It's up on the radio, pie.  Oh, stinky.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Billy.  Don't you understand, though?  Seriously.  Like, if I was living with, like, a hot, let's say, stripper and heard, like, dirty laundry 
[00:53:30]  was under our beds.  Come on.  The whiff of the perfume, and that's, oh, my Lord.  This guy's having a field day.  And I would have more electronic surveillance equipment than, like, a James Bond movie in  that bathroom.  Stinky, you've got to think of yourself as, like, a hot stripper.  Just so you can understand what you are to this guy.  Right.  But I'd rather not even think about it.  Stinky, you've got to think of yourself like that.  Oh, he's right on this one.  This guy, to him, you're like that.  Like, if you're living, if you're a single guy, right? 
[00:54:00]  If you're a single guy, all of a sudden your roomie is a penthouse pet, playboy model,  whatever.  Aren't you going to try to sneak a peek?  Aren't you going to be looking at her every second going, God damn, that's hot?  Aren't you going to be drilling holes in the door?  Aren't you going to smash her over the head with a spade shovel and rape her corpse?  What?  What?  What?  I thought we were just telling what we would do.  You smoke a lot of dope.  Oh, who knows when you're stoned.  You don't even know what's going on when you pass out.  I know what Jay Marko says.  You straight guys are one six-pack away from being gay. 
[00:54:30]  I just don't even want to think about it.  Joe wants to know if you wrap the toilet seat before sitting down.  Yeah, what goes on there?  You share the toilet?  You find your gray pubes anywhere?  I think.  Oh, no.  No?  In the soap?  You're washing your face all of a sudden, you're like, oh, oh.  The big gnarly gray piece of steel wool in your soap.  God damn.  This is the most disgusting place I've ever heard of, and I've never seen it. 
[00:55:00]  Jesse.  Yeah, boys.  Wow.  Jesse, what's going on?  What's happening?  How are you?  I am actually looking for a roommate.  My roommate's moving out today.  Now you can not relate to what this guy's doing if you move in with us.  All right, hold on.  Jesse, can you hold on?  Sure.  All right, because we have to take a break.  We'll take a break, and we'll talk with Jesse and maybe do a little interview here either  way and see if you're compatible.  All right.  You could be winning the lottery today, Stacey.  Do you realize that?  Who's your pals?  O&A. 
[00:55:30]  Jesse, are you hot?  The gay pedagogy.  I mean O&A.  She says she's hot.  Where are you right now?  Well, I can't really say because I'm calling from home, but let's just say it's like less  than seven blocks from here.  Oh.  Why don't you come down?  And, hey, there's a bonus.  I live on the 44th floor.  Hey, could you come down here?  Could you come down right now?  I can't come down today because I have to leave in about 15 minutes.  Where are you going?  Oh, I have a job, boys.  What kind of job?  We have to look out for Stacey.  She's the publisher of Danish pedophile.  What industry are you in? 
[00:56:00]  How's that?  Entertainment.  Oh.  But not that kind of entertainment.  You don't dance, do you?  No, I don't dance.  I dance the good way.  How old are you, Jess?  20.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Do you go to Avery's at the dance school or whatever around here?  No.  Are you serious though, Jesse?  I am definitely serious.  What kind of rent are we talking?  Well, it's really high up, so my rent is a huge chunk.  His half would be like $1,500.  I know.  What can I say? 
[00:56:30]  If you think you could afford $1,500,  I don't think you would be in the pedophile gay loft thing.  Look, Stinky, I linted like $7 last week, right?  Remember that Life of County job?  Yeah.  I linted $7 last week.  Yeah, I linted $5.  All right, all right.  Oh, that sucks.  I know.  How about you get, like, two others then?  Well, it's only two.  What about the gay pedo guy?  Do you want to come along?  Look, it's obvious Stinky only needs a closet. 
[00:57:00]  Okay.  Well, I have actually a really big closet I could shove him in.  The walk-in closet.  Right.  Oh, Stinky.  We thought we found her.  See, the thing is, we're going to have to go over how much Stinky can afford.  You know?  Right.  I mean, I don't even know what he's paying now for this hovel.  The homo hovel.  The homo hovel.  The mole people live better than Stinky.  The mole people.  Go on the subway.  Hey, there's a guy on line 8.  A guy on line 8 said he'll cover rent if he could peek. 
[00:57:30]  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  Oh, Jesse.  What are we going to do with Jesse?  I don't know, but I'll come down there sometime, guys.  All right.  Yeah, you can do that.  Okay, good.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  I knew we finally got some.  We have some audio of a Stinky's roommate from last night.  Do you like having your background?  Yes, I do.  Butt sex. 
[00:58:00]  Anthony, we have the microphone on right now, and Stinky's roommate is wearing Stinky's underwear.  Dance around.  Let's listen in.  How's that for a topper?  This is right when Stinky walked in the door last night.  The guy was just standing there.  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  So what do you think of my tight pants? 
[00:58:30]  Um, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh.  Stinky's passed out.  He's smoked a lot of pot, and here's some audio from his roommate.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  And then right after that, I have some audio here.  It's a little disturbing.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  Stinky's roommate, how was it for you? 
[00:59:00]  Virgin.  Oh.  Oh, look at that.  What are you doing right now?  Coming.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the halls.  I hear there was some serenading, trying to get Stinky in the mood.  Oh, Samuel.  That's a winner. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, boy.  All right.  Stinky, it's your roommate.  Come home.  Tony.  Tony.  Stinky's talking about me.  I want him locked.  It's running my reputation.  I got the earth cancer. 
[01:00:00]  I got to deal with Stinky talking about me.  Stinky looks bad, baby.  Well, wouldn't you?  Yeah.  All dirty.  Wouldn't you?  Yo, dude.  What's up, Mike?  The guy.  Yo, what's up, Ben?  Relax.  Don't mess with Ben.  I'm a little nervous today.  I got Ben's back.  Relax.  Incycling?  Yeah.  You look into the new Ben.  I love the new Ben.  I want to move out.  Really, do you? 
[01:00:30]  How'd you get in with this brother in the first place?  I had him move in.  What, he came with the apartment or something?  I got kicked out of school.  You know, I was kicked out of the dorms.  I wasn't going to school anymore.  All right.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got a place I'm giving up at the end of the month, man.  He could take the whole thing and get his own roommate.  10-5 on, uh, it's over on 3rd Avenue.  10-5?  Yeah, $1,050.  Moving out on Thursday.  Oh, oh, oh.  And he could get his own roommate.  He could pick and choose what gay guy he wants moving with. 
[01:01:00]  Howdy.  Dang it.  All right, Stink.  We got a place now.  We just found a gay guy for you.  Oh, great.  We have a guy on the line right now that wants to be Stinkie's roommate?  Yeah.  I'm Big Dick Black.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Hello?  Is this a prospect for a roommate?  Hello?  How are you?  How are you?  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot. 
[01:01:30]  All right, hold on.  Are you serious, Dave?  Yeah.  Because our buddy needs a break.  It's a hard time hearing you, but I'm, yeah, I'm giving up a place.  I'm moving out all this week.  All right, hold on a second, okay?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Stinkie, grab his number and see if there's anything there, right?  All right.  We should take a break.  What the hell were you thinking?  Exactly.  Yeah.  That wild story.  Your balls are healing.  We do have to take a break, but Ben's girlfriend's on the line. 
[01:02:00]  Kristen?  Hey, guys.  Oh, it's a 17-year-old that loves Ben.  Hold on, all right?  All right.  We'll talk to you next.  We'll see how sober Ben handles his little girlfriend.  I'll take a break to the bar.  To the bar.  All right.  There's so many great calls left.  Thank you.  No.  All right, we've got to take a break, and we'll, yeah, continue this, right?  Nice.  That's what we do, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Hey, this is the Game Triple H from the World Wrestling Federation. 
[01:02:30]  This is no pussy radio.  This is the real deal.  Opie and Anthony.  102.7 WMW.  102.7 WMW.  Stalkers?  We got one in Stinky's place.  God, man.  Some of the instant feedback coming in.  From Man Mate, right here in New York.  Stinky's roommate's probably rolling around naked in Stinky's bed right now, smelling his  boyish odor on the sheets and pleasuring himself.  Oh, man.  And Dan from Hoboken, the saddest part is the Danish pedophile page is easier to navigate 
[01:03:00]  than Foundry Music.  Thank you, Dan.  Another stab in Foundry Music.  A lot of people are saying, why don't Psycho Mark and Stinky switch roommates?  That would be the obvious solution.  Well, Mark has a killer place.  That's why he deals with what he deals with.  Right.  That's what he's told everyone.  Really nice.  No, Ben, he does have a really nice place, though, right?  Stinky would be safer rooming with O.J. or Robert Blake.  And Ben?  The best about Mark is he brings these bimbos home. 
[01:03:30]  He's like, look at my great place.  Look at me.  I'm pulling in the money at Fox.  This is all mine.  He, like, says that it's his.  It's fine.  But Mark does have a really nice place.  He's got a great view.  He's on, like, the 43rd floor.  He looks out at the trade center.  He's an amazing view.  He just has to deal with the, you know, the game game.  Charles Johnson and Riley is really...  Ho, ho!  Okay.  Time to pay the rent.  Ho, ho!  The hard way.  Oh, ho, ho!  How's that for a topper?  Ho, ho!  Oh, you want to move in? 
[01:04:00]  First month, a month's security, and anal.  Ho, ho!  Ho, ho!  I love drinking.  Look, I'm running around with his underwear on my head.  Ho, ho, ho!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Oh, I'll pay all the gas, you pay the water, and I'll give you anal.  Ho, ho, ho!  Yeah, how much does Stink pay for to live like a veal?  How much do you pay? 
[01:04:30]  500.  Oh.  Is that guy for real?  Yeah, he really was.  All right, cool.  God, you've got to get out of there.  All right, Anthony, stack it to the world's strongest fat burner.  Most people move out.  Stinky's fleeing.  Like, when you have to flee...  Stinky, if he finds a place tonight, will not even go back to his...  He'll just leave his possessions there.  Yeah, just leave.  It's officially spring, Opie.  And before you, uh...  Stinky, before you start peeling off the layers of clothes,

[01:06:00]  Anthony, Gay Marco's on the line.  Oh, yeah?  Used to live with a stray cop, used to steal his undies.  Oh, no.  We'll get it from a gay guy.  Yeah.  Not literally.  We'll get the info from a gay guy about what it's like living with a straight guy.  Right, because that's the situation Stinky's in,  and Ben's little girlfriend on the line as well, so stay there.  What's the meaning of this cranking on?  Dude, it's all we got!  Whatever.  LTV, that's the new show.  A smorgasbord's opinion.  1027.  The greatest radio I've ever heard. 
[01:06:30]  WMEW.  Jesus, man.  Stinky's getting advice from all dirty.  Yeah.  What were you saying all day?  Yo, dude, man, that's what's wrong in this country, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Yo, if you do insider trading or you're going to scam the government,  they get upset and they want to hit you over the head with 20 years.  But if they find your possession of minor porn, bro, you're looking at little girls and young boys,  they stopped you with like two or three years, my brother.  What's going on in this country, man?  Do you understand what I'm saying? 
[01:07:00]  No.  Yo, it's not, it's not, yo, the, the, the, you know, the laws, man.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, like, if you do insider trading, be like, like my man, what was his name?  That big Michael Milken.  Right.  The bonds and all that.  They wanted to hit him over the head.  You know what I'm saying?  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Yes.  Memorial Day weekend is the unofficial, I call it the official start of summer. 
[01:07:30]  It's pretty much when everyone knows it's summer, you know?  It's summer.  Get your summer off to a better start.  With a better beer, we're talking Sam Adams.  We love it.  We want to have a kegger.  We were going to have a kegger today.  We really were.  I don't know what happened.  Within the next week, we're going to have a kegger.  We'll just have a kegger in here.  We'll have a party.  Screw it.  And we'll have cold kegs of Sam Adams.  Did Sam Adams make those beer balls?  The beer ball.  I used to love the beer balls. 
[01:08:00]  No, you know what I want?  I want that little short keg of Dinkalacker.  It comes with the plastic cap.  If you put it in the side, it fits in the back of your Nova.  The plastic beer balls, though.  Come on.  The beer ball.  No, we got a keg of Sam Adams.  We're going to have a kegger.  We're going to have a kegger.  Right.  Sam Adams, the most awarded beer on the planet and in history.  Trade up this summer.  Better food, better parties, and of course, better beer.  Look forward to a better summer with Sam Adams. 
[01:08:30]  We drink it all the time.  We love it.  It's in the back.  We got cases.  Is the fridge stock?  I had a problem, Opie, yesterday.  You were really pissed off last night.  You should tell everyone what happened after the show.  Well, the fine people at Sam Adams, Jim Cook, you know, he sends us cases of Sam Adams.  We love them.  So they're stacked up.  I get back to the office after the show, the long, uncomfortable walk down the hallway,  and I want an icy cold Sam. 
[01:09:00]  I open up the fridge.  Nothing.  What?  It's not full.  And I say, I go, John, John, why isn't the fridge stocked with icy cold Sam Adams?  He points at the cases and goes, there's some right here.  Yeah, but it's warm.  I'm like, right, old dirty, right.  We have five cases of Sam Adams outside the refrigerator right now.  It's all warm.  Yo, this is your fault?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's John's fault.  John, is there now beer in the fridge? 
[01:09:30]  Two sixes.  John could be the first intern that's going to fire himself.  Oh, no.  No.  Terminate yourself, boy.  Fire yourself.  Because that is what we're gunning for.  The next person we have to fire or let go, we're going to make them fire themselves.  Remember the patch over the eye intern and then Jesse?  We dropped the ball because we should have as their last official duty to be to fire themselves. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, John, how do you choke yourself?  We should ask John how he feels about this because the two guys that were in his position before him both got let go of ours.  Right.  Do you walk the hallways a little nervous?  Yeah, it's like I'm walking a thin line here.  It's either I really have to prove myself or I'm just waiting for the other shoe to talk.  Wow.  You better make sure them six-packs in there when Anthony gets in the office.  Yeah, you can start by getting the Sam Adams in the fridge.  That's always, that's top priority.  Screw the show prep or anything else.  Beer in the fridge.  Yeah, man. 
[01:10:30]  You want a long, prosperous career here at any dog, you better be on point, punk.  Wow.  Dirty, back on the bench.  I'm waiting for you back there.  Paul, look what happened to Jesse when it's his first gig.  All right.  All right, O.D.  Sam Adams.  Sam Adams, yeah.  I'm looking forward to an icy cold one right after the show.  All right, Gay Marco still on hold and Ben's little girlfriend.  We only have just a couple more minutes here and we'll be back.  Get your balls out.  Slap your ass up. 
[01:11:00]  Get your penis.  It's today's about to be the gayest thing I've ever heard.  The O.D. and Anthony Show.  We're not homosexual, but we are willing to learn.  1027-WNA-WNO-5.  We're rocking, right, old dirty?  New old kids' country.  Drowning full body.  The O.N.H.O., 212-757-1027. 
[01:11:30]  Anthony, really fast.  Maybe people just tuning in for the show.  We've got to get to Gay Marco, but we need a quick setup here.  Well, Stinky's looking for a new place to live.  He has a roommate.  He's been there since November.  And his roommate is some 63-year-old man who trolls the Internet for Danish pedophile pages and whatnot.  Some kiddie porn.  He's a gay guy.  And it's a very small, cramped, disgusting place that Stinky has a little loft bed in in the same room as this 63-year-old guy who wakes up at 1 in the morning to go to the computer that's in the kitchen where Stinky has to prepare his food and probably cranks it out. 
[01:12:00]  Where do you eat?  I really eat up to my bed.  Stinky's hamper is in the same room, so now Stinky's here.  The guy's probably home using his dirty laundry to whatever sick ends he feels he wants to do. 
[01:12:30]  Like we said earlier, Stinky's underwear is potpourri for his roommates.  Potpourri?  It is.  It's a Glade plug-in.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com went on the Danish pedophile website.  Yeah.  Get him in here because he found some interview or something.  He's got to explain this.  Is he coming back?  He's got work to do, but we're using...  All right.  What do you got here?  This is an interview with a 16-year-old boy who was having sex allegedly with a 37-year-old man since he was 13 years old. 
[01:13:00]  Yes, young boy.  Yes.  Since he was 13.  Yeah, and the odd thing is, it's nothing terribly shocking.  He's just trying to justify the existence and the whole practice of pedophilia, and it's very odd.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Yeah.  All right, why don't you read a little bit of that so we can...  Well, here's the one I just picked up.  How do you mean?  If I have problems at school, my mother always assumes it's my fault and I have to stop acting the way I do. 
[01:13:30]  But Christian feels that there may be something wrong with the other kids.  Well, you can't do anything...  Hold on, hold on, Steve.  Sorry, sorry.  Just got to do something.  Okay.  Okay.  All right, start reading again.  Okay.  This is a good sound.  This is so fun.  That's been rude.  He's asking if...  The interviewer asks if the pedophile understands him better. 
[01:14:00]  Absolutely.  He understands me a lot better than my own mother.  Oh, my God.  This is real.  That makes me a little sad.  I think your parents, of all people, should devote the most time to you.  Moms don't give you enough anal.  That's what it is.  And this guy needs some.  So, you know, you go out and you've got to find the guy.  There was one over here that had...  I don't even know how much of this I can say.  Ouch.  Someone wants it on stage.  You sure that's frost on your flakes?  Oh.  Oh.  Huh.  Oh.  Thank you.  Oh. 
[01:14:30]  Got a cream in your coffee.  Hmm.  Okay.  Then you believe most boys would like to do it.  Yeah, I think so.  But I also have to say that I'm thinking of boys 10, 12, or 13 years old.  No kid, my age, who's never done it, will be likely to start now.  At my age, it's seen as homosexual.  I think I'm not...  It's seen as...  This is the 16-year-old boy talking.  This whole thing is weird.  It's just talking about how...  It's natural when you're 10 or 12, because the pedophile understands the way you feel. 
[01:15:00]  He understands if you want to have a sexual relationship.  It's very weird.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, he...  That guy touched me.  Did you ever try it with boys your own age?  No, only with girls.  You're not tempted to do it with another boy.  No, I cannot imagine it.  With someone your own age, that would be more homosexual.  Especially when you're 15, 16, or 17.  All boys and girls would think of it that way.  Yeah.  But it's okay to do it with a 35-year-old man. 
[01:15:30]  You'd be a faggot, baby.  Yeah, yeah.  A faggot.  Stinky's roommate touched me.  Whoa.  We're now calling Stinky sicky.  Oh.  Are you done over there, Stinky?  Well, I don't know if I can say this, so I...  There can't be...  Wrong.  Togging, dummy.  With a boy, it's all pretty much just stroking and caressing. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  Oh, no.  We got to get all...  Yeah.  Thank you.  Let's move on to Gay Marco.  Yes.  Let's straighten this conversation up.  Hey.  Let's butch it up a little bit.  Hey, Gay.  Hey, Mr. Gay.  Oh, hey.  What's up?  Hey, faggy.  Hey.  Well, about 10 years ago, I lived with this Nassau County cop.  He was straight.  We lived together for about a year. 
[01:16:30]  He didn't know I was gay.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  That's hard to figure out.  Of course.  How could a cop be blind, deaf, and dumb?  Well, I think he just, you know, wanted the money, but it doesn't matter.  What?  Because we had separate bedrooms, and, you know, it was fine at first, but he was gorgeous.  Oh, my God.  And I used to, like, fantasize about him.  Oh, no.  And then I started stealing his underwear.  Stop.  Oh, no.  I did.  See, Sinky?  Maybe I did.  So when would you steal his underwear? 
[01:17:00]  Well, he'd go out.  He worked during the night, and I worked during the day.  Of course, when he wasn't home.  Exactly.  I think he's not home right now.  You figure out what's going on, Sink.  But then on weekends, we'd both be home.  And then, well, actually, what happened first is he used to bring girls home and, like, bang them.  And I could hear it.  So I would, like, crawl up to his door, and, like, put my ear up against the door, and I'd hear him, like, going, uh, uh, uh.  You'd put your rear against the door?  Exactly.  Yeah, my ear against the door.  That's what I said, your rear.  Yes.  You'd put your rear against the doorknob? 
[01:17:30]  Yes.  That old gag.  I love that old gag.  See, so, uh, he was doing that.  So what did you do with his underwear?  Oh, I would, like, smell them, because they, I'd always, wait, wait.  I knew which ones he'd wear to work.  He always wore, like, the tighty-whities to work.  And then he'd wear, like, the boxer ones, like, during the day.  You wanted.  You know, when he wasn't working.  You wanted to work underwear.  I did.  Because they were nice and sweaty, right?  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[01:18:00]  They were fabulous.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  I'd keep them for about a week, and then I would put them back in his laundry so he wouldn't  know that they were, like, missing.  I'll keep them in rotation.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  They keep them fresher.  Did you like stained ones?  Oh, no.  Not really, no.  Did you like underwear that looked like a shoe shine rag?  No.  Oh.  That's the third time today.  We've got to use that all day.  I love that.  That's our new favorite.  What about, what, do you like frontal stains? 
[01:18:30]  Not really stains.  Just like when they smell, like, all sweaty and musky.  Oh, you are dead up faggot, ain't you?  Thinking, but this is what this guy's probably doing with your underwear.  They're giving you a way to get better.  We're giving you a little insight.  Better?  Go ahead.  So, towards the end.  Are you going to hang out?  That's the only way it is you get better for me.  So, towards the end, I would actually, yeah, I would go, and I would crawl into his bed  when he was at work.  He would never make his bed.  So, I'd get into his bed, and I'd sleep in his bed, and pleasure myself in his bed. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, my God.  Never appears.  It is here.  So, one day, I'd crawl into his bed, and I'm in there, and I'm, like, rolling around,  and all of a sudden, I'm like, what is that by my foot?  And I reached out, and it's a used condom.  Pain dirt.  Pain dirt.  Pain dirt.  Oh, my God.  God damn, that's like finding a fribble.  He was so hot.  It's sorbet before the main course. 
[01:19:30]  Cleanse the palate.  He was eating it like space food.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Haywood from Yonkers says, after living with Marco, now the same Long Island top is  making women walk home naked.  Yeah.  Wow, Marco.  Mm-hmm.  That story's disgusting. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, it was fabulous.  When I moved out, I stole a couple pair of his underwear.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  You need to get, like, space food.  Oh, my God.  You saw the old NASA footage.  You don't even have to explain my brother.  All right, Marco, thank you.  So, that's my story.  So, Stinky, here's my advice to you.  Oh, wow.  Get out!  Yeah, Stinky's turning white.  He really is.  Damn, you whiter.  Now I think I have to, like, set traps to make sure he doesn't go into my bed and stuff like  that.  You should do stuff. 
[01:20:30]  Like, you know, you rest a pair of women's panties on your pillow.  Word up.  No, you rest, like, a quarter on your hamper or something on the lid on the back.  Yeah, that's all right.  So, it would be, or something, a little fishing line or a hair tied to a knot or something.  Yeah.  Just something you would see that he can't see and see if they're effing with it.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You need a strong box for your underwear, please.  You should, you know, I would lock up your underwear.  I would take it.  There's no way, probably, for you to lock anything up. 
[01:21:00]  No.  There's no privacy.  You describe the place.  It's one, how big is the bedroom itself?  Not that big.  Not that big, I mean.  It's big enough, so there's his, the queen-size bed is on one end.  On one end.  The queen's bed's on the other.  And there's single beds on the other end.  And there's about a three-foot space between the two.  That's it.  That's it.  Three feet of space, but he's five feet below you.  No, no, he's in a loft.  He's in a loft, too.  Then what's on the floor? 
[01:21:30]  Like, dressers.  Oh, underneath the beds.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, what do you got, a little ladder you crawl up to get into bed?  Yeah.  And he watches you as you crawl up into bed.  Climb that ladder, you whore.  Walking around Pinky's apartment is like walking on a floor with flypaper put down.  Yeah, what kind of, is it carpeted in the bedroom?  Yeah.  So, you got carpeting.  Any windows?  There's one behind me, but there's a building two inches out of the window.  Oh, really?  It's one of those?  So, at like noon, you get the one second of sunlight. 
[01:22:00]  When the sun is directly above, it's like Indiana Jones, and it had to be perfect for  him to get the staff and the jewel on top.  What a place.  Jesus Christ.  Man, steak, you live in.  Wow, my brother.  So, then you have a curtain that you pull like, what, like a sleeper car on a train?  You pull a curtain, and you are all of a sudden just in your bed.  Yeah.  The curtain's pulled.  Yeah.  And it goes from the bed to the ceiling, so there's no way he can see over it or under 
[01:22:30]  it.  He can't.  You go to sleep with a knife under your pillow, okay, just to chase, yo.  And are you asleep in there at the same time?  Sometimes.  Well, you know, he gets, I don't know when he gets up at different hours of the morning.  What are you, you're just laying there, though, and you hear him, pfft.  Or in his case, ha!  That's not much friction.  Usually I just hear all the instant message noises.  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  It seems like the kind of place you'd see on one of those investigative reports later on 
[01:23:00]  that the guy was found, and, like, they have pictures of his room.  The chalk line.  Yeah, yeah, and the blood splattered wall.  They called him stinky.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, Steve, what's up?  Yeah, it happened to my girl, I know, right?  She had a roommate that was like 70, and she comes home,  and he's like laying in her bed wearing her thong and her bra.  It's like a Walkman.  So?  What's wrong with that? 
[01:23:30]  It's crazy.  Apparently he didn't hear her come in.  Why would you wear a Walkman?  I have no idea.  Hi, how you doing?  What's up?  Kind of just throwing on your panties and bras, comfy.  All right, Steve, thank you.  We don't even have to take stories from other people,  because no one's going to beat the Stinky Story out there.  The Stinky Story is just heinous.  All right, we should move on, heinous.  We have Jewel Denial outside the studio.  Nice.  We don't really know what we're going to do with her.  We'll get her in in a few seconds here. 
[01:24:00]  She's in that magazine.  What do you mean you don't know what you're going to do with her?  All right, we'll talk to her in a second here.  You, you, you.  And Kristen, you still there?  Hey, hi.  This is Ben's little girlfriend.  Hey, Ben.  She's 17 years old, and she, uh, she writes poetry.  Well, she, uh, last time she called, she read some poetry to Ben.  Ben was a little hungover and intoxicated and really bitched her out and called her all  kinds of names.  Whore.  Uh, bitch.  You rag, hag.  Uh, whore again.  Whore, whore.  Whore again.  Don't forget the jump in front of a bus. 
[01:24:30]  You jump in front of a bus, kill yourself, get in the coffin.  You whore.  Yeah, people actually thought, um, Otta was here with his hands, uh, up his back.  But now, uh, Ben isn't drunk.  And, um, hey, before we move on, uh, Dave has a great idea on line eight.  Uh, Dave suggests, uh, that Stinky brings his clothes in and we, we get a black light.  Yeah, yo, gotta be tested.  That's a good idea.  Or, or other things. 
[01:25:00]  You know, something, some of his own personal items from around the place.  Wow.  They need to be swabbed and put in the Petri dish and all that.  Nah, you just take that, you take that black light thing and you put it over it and you  can see.  Sploo.  Could be a full-scale investigation.  Sploo.  It's gonna look like an explosion at Peter Max's house.  It's gonna look at him.  So, Kristen.  Mm-hmm.  So, what do you have today?  Um, well, I'm calling up for, now, I am not an NSYNC fan.  My best friend is. 
[01:25:30]  She's a huge NSYNC fan.  Yeah, we're still playing Mommy.  What would you do for NSYNC Ticket?  I am willing to give Ben a Hummer for the NSYNC Ticket.  But you like Ben.  Yes.  That's the goal.  And this, this has been your goal.  It's absolutely kind of sex with Ben.  Yes.  So, why, that's not even, it's something you want to do.  Well, you know, what do you want me to do?  Get tar and feathers?  You just really need Ben, don't you?  I just want Ben badly.  Ben is hot.  Profess your attraction, those big, huge, luscious, fat boobs of yours. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  You're the chubby girl, right?  I'm not chubby.  I don't know what that girl is talking about.  I hurt her.  Do you have back boobs?  No.  No back boobs?  No.  Do you got thunder thighs?  No.  You thick.  You're just a big girl, right?  Well, let's see how this goes.  Yeah, very tall.  I've got that from my father's side of the family.  Well, let's see how this goes today.  Ben, you're on with your little girlfriend, Kristen. 
[01:26:30]  She's 17 years old.  And what age did Daddy bang you?  You know what?  You shouldn't be talking about my father right now, okay?  Why?  What happened?  He's in the hospital with cancer, so.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  Sir, don't be talking about my father.  That's a whole different story.  Opie, can I teach you a little something, Opie?  You don't laugh at people when they say that.  No, I heard it.  You don't laugh.  You let the machine...  That way it doesn't hurt your vocal cords. 
[01:27:00]  I mean, you can do the whole show.  It's just our way of getting through an uncomfortable situation, Kristen.  Your mind does.  No problem.  Ben, so here's your little girlfriend.  Her father's in the hospital with cancer.  Let's be nice to her today.  Ben.  Yeah, I mean, don't be, like, telling me to jump in front of the thighs.  I was hoping you would.  I was hoping I'd read in the post Saturday that you were dead.  Oh, oh, okay. 
[01:27:30]  That's nice.  And you just keep coming back for more because Ben is the love of your life.  Oh, yeah.  You want to come down here and meet Ben?  I'd love to.  All right.  Where are you right now?  I'm in Nassau County.  I can get there.  Well, you could get here in an hour.  No, I don't have a ride or anything.  Kristen?  Yeah?  Does your daddy have, you know...  Hmm?  Is he going to be around for a while?  Don't make jokes about the big casino. 
[01:28:00]  Um, I hope so.  Yeah.  It must make you really sad, huh?  What?  It doesn't make you sad.  Um, well, can we get off the subject of my father?  I just mentioned that, yeah.  I know.  No, that isn't a good subject, Opie.  No, I know.  I just want to make sure she's okay.  Yeah, my father's fine, believe me.  What kind of cancer does that mean?  Uh, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Oh, thank God it's the non-kind. 
[01:28:30]  Well, non-lymphoma.  Oh, thank God it's the non-kind.  Oh, my dear sweet children.  I don't know.  Um, I'll say a prayer for your...  I know non-fat is more gooder than fat, so non...  Right?  Is non better or worse?  Yes, it is.  It's actually the best type of cancer you can get.  There you go, Anthony.  The best kind?  Yeah, well, it's, you know, seeing that, you know...  The best kind.  How about the non-kind?  Yeah, that would be good. 
[01:29:00]  Whatever.  Oh.  Right, Ben, my father is alien.  You know, I just need someone to help me out.  Oh, my God.  Don't you want to help me, Ben?  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  In your heart.  Oh, no, no, no.  No, I'm not the girl from out there.  Yeah, I need all to say. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, no, no.  This is horrible.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's what you get for living by them high-tension wives.  Oh, Jesus.  Old Dirty has a conspiracy for every time.  You've got to hear Old Dirty's latest conspiracy.  It's hilarious.  He comes in, he goes, the conspiracy of trees is over.  I'm like, the conspiracy of trees?  How is all of the trees conspiring?  You amazed me.  Yeah, Old Dirty, what's up with that? 
[01:30:00]  Yo, man, the Parks Department came and planted these certain trees that I'm allergic to,  so I was locked down for 45 days with the post-nable trees.  They figured it was a way to keep you in your crib.  Now, how old are these trees?  Oh, they're youngins.  They just planted them.  Yeah, they got a little height, but, you know, they ain't full.  And you notice your algae started right after they planted the tree.  Right after, April 1st.  It was no joke.  Old Dirty, if, let's say, you worked somewhere, you would leave your house and go away from the tree. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, but I was working, too.  And the pollen was just all over.  But the pollen was like kryptonite.  You couldn't get past that line of trees.  That's my word.  I couldn't leave my house and go to work.  Do you know what's helping the pollen out now, though, is that finally we're getting rain.  Rain, yeah.  So now, do you think there's a conspiracy with the weather?  No, no, no.  The weather's all good.  Rudy Giuliani maybe had his hand in there.  With my weather machine, I'll keep Old Dirty in his house.  Simon Barnes Sinister. 
[01:31:00]  Mayor Giuliani.  We have the same haircut and head.  With my weather machine, I'll rule the world.  His machines aren't working too well because he can't even get his girlfriend into his house.  I must destroy Donahann over.  Oh, we're loving it.  Keeping my squeeze out of the house.  What was his partner's name?  Rock Bottom, was it Rock?  Rock Bottom.  Or Riff Raff.  Riff Raff.  Riff Raff.  Work that bitch over. 
[01:31:30]  She's quite the aunt.  You're loving the Rudy Giuliani thing there, Old Dirty?  Son, yo, he released a dead man's record after he was shot.  So now it's only justified that we just get to see his downfall, his suffering, dude.  I'm loving it.  Who's a criminal record?  Yeah, man.  Yo, that kid that got shot by the bar, man.  When the cop came up and asked him for crack, the guy said, yo, get away from me, man.  I ain't no crack here.  So I don't know what happened.  And the guy, they started shooting, you know, shooting out of the habit, he shot him. 
[01:32:00]  They were shooting lead there.  Yeah, they were shooting lead.  And then 24 hours later, Giuliani comes out and says, oh, he was arrested before, you  know, like to justify, oh, he was shot because he had a criminal record.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  If the pigeons have to come home to root.  So now you like the fact that he's got the prostate cancer.  His wife is raking him over the coals.  Man, I ain't feeling this cancer, man, because I wouldn't want to have it.  But as far as his wife, man, he's committing adultery in public, man.  You know, he got his hottie, his hoochie mama coming into the mansion. 
[01:32:30]  He's still mad.  His kids are there.  Do you think Giuliani refers to her as his hoochie mama?  No.  Your Honor, I would like the right to keep my hoochie mama in Gracie Mansion.  You know what I'm saying?  He's committed public adultery, man.  He's separated from Hanover.  But he's a divorced.  No.  And he wants to be a ghost Catholic and then do it to the Brooklyn Museum and then he wants  to set up his commission on decency.  Man, shut up, punk.  He is a crock of crap. 
[01:33:00]  But you know something?  This Hanover is quite the aunt.  She is.  She's an aunt.  Yeah, it's turning out that she's rich there.  You got a little claw.  You know something?  She's using the kids, like they all do, using the kids to say the reason she doesn't want  that Rudy Giuliani's girlfriend in Gracie Mansion has nothing to do with the fact that she  doesn't want her there.  It's not healthy for the children.  The children who haven't even hung out or seen the father, they haven't met his girlfriend  yet.  They haven't even met her.  They live in the same house.  They've been in the same house for a while. 
[01:33:30]  They haven't even bumped in to say, hey, how do you do?  I'm banging your pop or I'm, you know, playing with the limp noodle or whatever it is.  It's not healthy.  She makes it sound like they're having, like, an anal right in front of the kids.  Right, right.  It doesn't matter.  Like Rudy said, this is a mature relationship, an adult relationship.  They're going out in the swings in the back.  Whee!  Push me again!  We know it's a mature relationship.  So, but he's bringing the mistress into the crib, though.  So?  That's all right.  Hanover should get her fat ass out. 
[01:34:00]  Hanover got nice legs.  That's when she's got stumplates.  She's got that goddamn free leg.  She's like Hillary Clinton.  No, she don't.  She's got Hillary Clinton ass, Hillary Clinton legs.  She's a hag.  She's a bitch.  And you know something?  I don't like Giuliani any more than the next guy.  Believe me, I'm not a fan of his.  But just because he's a prick doesn't mean she's an angel.  This woman, this woman, you know something?  He works out of that mansion.  That's the official house of the mayor of New York.  So she should get her fat ass out of there.  If he wants to ban chicks night and day in there, it should be his right. 
[01:34:30]  Well, you know what?  She showed her true colors last night showing up at the hospital with the mayor's 91-year-old  Right.  Mom, Fenton.  Rudy kept her out.  Kept her out.  Me too.  Yeah, like that.  But there was no reason for her to show up at the hospital in the middle of the night  like that.  Why had it, though?  Well, because they had an ugly court thing, you know, earlier in the same day.  It's so she looks like, look, she's rushing to the bedside of her estranged husband's mother. 
[01:35:00]  Look at what a sweetie she is and what a son of a bitch she is.  He won't even let her in.  She's all calculated.  She's an actress.  Bad one, albeit.  But, you know, she's an actress.  She knows how to play it off.  You put her name in the internet movie database.  It comes out in 20,000 days.  She always plays herself.  Oh, what a stretch.  Fat aunt.  She's listed as playing a fat aunt.  Can we get back to Kristen, the 17-year-old?  Oh, yeah.  Who wants to give Ben a hug.  Sexual favors.  For the NSYNC tickets.  Hey, for the NSYNC tickets, Kristen?  Yeah.  Would you eat a chocolate sundae out of Ben's Dooper? 
[01:35:30]  No.  I got Dooper.  Okay, that's where I draw the line.  The Swamp.  No.  Maybe from me, but not me.  You know you want to make Ben's booty crack.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Ben, what do you think?  Are you feeling it with Kristen today?  No, I just wish she would kill herself or jump in front of a bus.  She's not liking you.  Oh, well, Ben's an ass.  Why don't you come down so we can check you out? 
[01:36:00]  I'll see what I can do.  You know what it is?  You know what?  Yes.  You're avoiding it.  Yes.  If you want, hopefully, like, my ex-boyfriend Bobby.  I'm really good friends with him.  He's probably a good friend.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He's a good friend of the show.  What is his name?  He loves the show.  And he'll probably call you up and tell you guys how good I am.  What do you mean how good you are?  I don't want him to come to the studio.  None of that.  I know how you get with the ex-boyfriend.  So, Ben, she's good at giving the Hummer.  Yeah, like that?  Yeah.  Like that? 
[01:36:30]  You got pro knee pads, baby.  How old were you when you did your first Hummer?  Um, a few months ago.  Nice.  She's a rookie.  Yeah.  But she's like, you know, she's like the rookie ballplayers that do very well.  Yeah, and Ben could teach you how to give a day on.  She's having a good first season.  Go on.  Ben?  Here.  What?  Ben, she's 17.  Come on, Ben.  How many 17-year-olds want to give you a good day?  You can't.  First of all, you can't.  Why not?  Huh?  Let's put a whole 30. 
[01:37:00]  Why not?  Why not?  All right, I got to ask you a question.  What you would do for NSYNC tickets.  Would you eat your father's tumor?  No.  Oh, my.  Why?  I have a butter.  We know this is extreme kind of, you know, we want this contest to be.  What did I say?  Did I do something wrong?  Well, they're important tickets, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Kristen, you all right?  You're not crying or anything, are you?  Oh, no, no, no.  Yeah, that wouldn't be too cool.  Can't whiffle ball bat challenge?  Um, no. 
[01:37:30]  You're fake IDs.  No?  That wouldn't work.  That couldn't fit.  This is all moot, Opie, because, um.  Thank you.  I am still a virgin.  We can't do anything with her.  No.  All right.  She's only 17.  Kristen, um.  17.  Yeah, I get your fake IDs.  Yeah, Kristen, we're going to have to let you go, okay?  Yeah, we can't do anything.  Well, can I become a friend of the show, at least?  No.  When's your birthday?  When are you going to be 18?  And don't lie.  Don't let her go.  Don't let her go.  I'm not going to lie.  My birthday is on August of this year. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  Well, when you're 18, come down and we'll, uh, let her go.  Oh, don't let her go.  John, what's up?  Just keep being humble.  Oh.  Yeah, John, you're on.  Yo, Kristen.  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing, baby?  I'm doing good, and you?  So, I'm all right.  So, uh, so you just gave your first hummer a few weeks, a few months ago?  Yeah.  Oh, my.  Did you like it?  Uh, it was all right.  It was all right?  Did you love the guy?  Uh, yeah.  So, when you were doing it, were you thinking of your dead, rotting father?  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:30]  Where are you at?  Think about his yellow skin.  Come on.  Come on.  It's eating away.  No, it's your problem.  No, no.  Do you think, do you think that, no, no.  Okay.  Do you think that he would like to know as he's dying, like they're on his deathbed?  Hang up on him.  I'm not speaking to this.  Do you think it says he's dying?  No, okay.  Yeah, kiss my ass.  Okay, get off.  It's about that.  It's about that.  Hey, baby.  Yeah.  Turn it off. 
[01:39:00]  Kristen.  Yeah?  Kristen.  Healthy one now.  Thank you.  As he's dying.  No, no, no, no.  No.  What?  Wake up on him.  Someone is dead.  What?  I thought we were just having fun.  Oh, just.  What?  Oh, just having fun.  And think about healthy thoughts and everything.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Were you thinking of his little daughter, his little baby princess doing the Neil and Bob? 
[01:39:30]  Oh, my.  No, okay.  Were you thinking about that?  No.  Were you thinking, oh, my God, I hope my father is proud of me.  I hope he's doing good.  Well, my father didn't have cancer a few months ago, mind you.  Oh, so it was okay for you to swallow a bunch of manspam?  Oh, thanks.  I love it.  Someone hang up on this faggot.  No, hey, I'm not a faggot.  Hey, I'll, I'll, give me a banyan.  I'll prove I'm not a faggot.  You?  No, that's okay.  You sound like a real loser, right? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, that, that.  So, so do you really hope that your father is doing well?  What do you think?  I, well, I don't know.  I mean, it's.  All right.  I, you know, that's, that's just not nice, John.  What the hell?  What happened there?  And why, I, I don't even understand that.  Kristen, I apologize for that.  That was rude.  Sean.  Whatever.  No, I, that was bad.  Sean.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Listen, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most deadly type of cancer and it's the most painful.  You usually die from it in about three to six months. 
[01:40:30]  I don't know what anybody's been telling this girl.  I'm not joking.  My girlfriend goes to med school.  I know.  Oh.  Um, well, first of all, uh, okay, um, okay, I'm going to try to respond to that.  Okay, terrific.  First of all, Richard.  All right, wait, wait, Richard.  Richard, uh, feels really bad about what's been going on.  Richard?  Yeah, you know, I'm thinking maybe Kristen can launch her father's tumor out of her, uh, 
[01:41:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  Her private of her enemies instead of an egg for the tickets.  I think that would be great.  Oh, man.  Those are pennies I ain't recognized.  Ouch!  Wow, that's pretty harsh, Richard.  That's not bad.  Have a good one, guys.  Brutal kidding.  Kristen, you all right?  Whatever.  Yeah, that was, that was, that, you know, that went over the line, guys. 
[01:41:30]  What the hell, man?  Tommy!  Hey, Kristen, I'm sorry to hear about your dad.  My dad also, he died of cancer a couple of years ago.  But I have a quick question for you.  Is it fun to bang your dad now since he went through all the chemo?  Does he glow?  He's like the glowing monkey kid from two months ago, remember?  Wow.  I hope he feels bad.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's...  Bye-bye, guys.  All right, Tommy.  All right, so...  So, Ben, you're not going to get a hummer from Kristen? 
[01:42:00]  Come on, Ben.  It's all good, kid.  Kristen, you all right?  I'm speechless.  Yeah.  She's only 17.  Yeah, that wasn't too...  Can't be soliciting sexual favors.  Oh, that's right.  From her.  Yeah, I might commit in a criminal act.  All right, Kristen.  Probably.  My best to you and...  Whatever.  I'm just speechless. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I would...  My best to you and your dad.  Yeah.  I have just one question.  Mm-hmm.  Ben?  Of course, this is to Ben.  Do you still want me to jump in front of a bus?  Yeah, that'd be great.  Okay, Ben, no matter what you say, I still have a crush on you.  You're adorable.  Do you have any more poems you want to read?  My ex-boyfriend, Bobby, did want me to write a whole poem on me jumping in front of a bus,  but I decided against it. 
[01:43:00]  Carmen?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  What the hell are you guys doing to this girl?  Yeah.  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  We're getting listeners.  They're so vicious today for some reason.  Hey, Kristen, are you stupid?  Kristen, you're stupid.  I'm stupid.  You don't think I'm letting them rag you like that.  You're stupid.  I...  Get the hell off the phone and don't call there no more.  Like you.  Yeah, you faggot.  Yeah, faggot.  I'll show you faggot.  Yeah, faggot.  You screaming queen.  I'll take that black ass.  Yeah, screaming queen.  I'll take that black ass and slap it silly. 
[01:43:30]  I wish I could smack it, you faggot.  Bring that...  Bring those double eggplants over here.  I'll slap them silly.  I'll take my white monster and slap that black ass.  Slap that black ass.  Yeah, smack the slaggot.  Swear to God.  Smack it, you faggot.  You'll think it was the old riot fire hoses when it hits you.  You'll fly across the street.  You will fly across the street.  Yeah, I'm begging my mom.  Yeah, you know you like that. 
[01:44:00]  Ah, she left.  All right, well...  Patty, what's going on?  Patty.  You've got to hang up on this girl already.  Come on now.  Yeah, that was way too wrong.  You're killing me with this stuff.  I turned my back in protest.  People will do anything to be a part of our show.  It's quite disgusting.  Come on now.  I had to listen to it the other day.  It's getting old.  It's getting old?  You've got to get a life.  Kiss my ass, bitch.  There you go. 
[01:44:30]  Kiss my ass.  Yeah.  Get a clue, bitch.  I kissed my ass.  All right.  All right, you guys, you know...  Just to get it.  You're not.  Be nice.  Frank, what's going on?  I just wanted to say I'm really shocked at what's going on.  Kristen, you sound really hot and driving right now.  I'm about as stiff as your old man right now.  No, stop it.  Come on, man.  Sweet, merciful crap. 
[01:45:00]  What do you say we get together?  Jesus Christ.  Frank, stop.  All right, guys, take care.  I am stupefied.  Kristen.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, I'll be your daddy, baby.  Easy.  Oh, dirty.  Easy.  Billy is definitely very pissed off about what's been going on here.  Billy. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to know, Kristen, do you think you're going to be able to dance to your  father at your wedding?  Ooh.  I guess he won't be giving me away, huh?  Right.  Come on.  The guy's going to be fine.  Kristen, he's going to be fine.  I know that.  It's just these calls are very effed up.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  That's awful.  All right, Kristen.  We're going to let you go.  Yeah.  Ben, once again, doesn't really want you, and you're too young. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, you might have to try something different, okay?  You might want to give me a hummer.  I mean, if she's too young.  How old is she?  How old is she?  17.  Yes, I.  Yeah, that's prime picking for you.  Look out.  If he got help in there.  Ring the bell.  That would be awful.  I can't. 
[01:46:30]  Kristen?  Oh, my.  Kristen?  We lost Kristen.  Marianne?  Yeah.  Hi, Marianne.  I just cannot believe how many times you're being to, like, this little girl.  Yeah.  Oh, that's Kristen.  She's gone.  I love that sound.  And that's the, you're drunk off your ass.  You wake up at five in the morning to that sound because you stumbled over the phone when 
[01:47:00]  you passed out on the couch.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Loud, too.  What the, who the, what the F?  Marianne?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was very wrong.  Oh, my God.  I just, I obviously do a girl have problems.  She's like a little girl.  I know.  The listeners should be ashamed of themselves today.  Yes, they should.  No.  By the way, the guy with the wedding line, call back.  We got a prize for you.  Hey.  All right, Marianne.  Thank you.  Okay.  Well, we, we got to move on, Anthony. 
[01:47:30]  Jewel Denial.  Yeah.  We'll get her in the studio next.  Jewel Denial.  We got, um, Vince and, uh, and Nikki, of course, from, uh, Motley Crue talking about  their autobiography.  That's, it's a great book.  We've been having a lot of fun with that.  And, uh, hopefully there'll be a lot of fun on the radio today.  Okay?  Yes.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Hopi and Anthony.  You're dribbling puke!  1-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, Hopi.  Auto-Lock, uh, one of our brand new sponsors, uh, to the show.  Auto-Lock.  Oh, look who we got in the studio to talk about Auto-Lock.  Here we go with the Auto-Lock.  You know, cars stolen every 20 seconds.  It's over 4,000 cars a day.  Don't let yours be next.  Get the protection that, uh, scares thieves away from your car.  It's Auto-Lock Pro.  Let me ask, uh, Old Dirty about those, uh, those steer, the steering wheel locks.  The steering wheel locks.  How easy are they to, to, to get off the steering wheel? 
[01:48:30]  Stupid easy.  Stupid easy?  We've seen a demonstration.  You got a steering wheel that's made out of foam and thin tube.  It's a hollow tube in the middle that a hacksaw could get through in, like, five seconds.  You're through it.  It's like nothing.  You're all hooked.  You're all, you're all pumped up on the crack of the crystal meth.  You want to get the car so you can boost it and get some cash for your next, uh, crystal meth or something.  So your arm is, you get through that.  You bend the steering wheel out a little bit.  The steering wheel lock, gone. 
[01:49:00]  How pissed are you that, uh, Whitey finally figured out that those things don't work as well as they did?  That's all right.  The technology can't advance quicker than the criminal mentality.  Wow.  Now look at this.  Auto-Lock Pro, an anti-theft device.  Locks onto your brake.  What?  In seconds.  We've seen it demonstrated.  You know the metal that your brake pedal's made out of?  Yeah.  That stuff's pretty tough, right?  It ain't breaking that.  It locks right around there.  Holds the brake pedal up from being depressed.  You can't push the brake pedal down.  You can't put it in gear.  If, God forbid, you did get it rolling, you ain't stopping. 
[01:49:30]  So it's, it's, you cannot move it.  And how are you going to get it off?  That's some heavy gauge steel, my brother.  The lock itself, made out of, it's bulletproof.  It's freon-proof, drill-proof, pick-proof, saw-proof.  Look at Old Dirty looking all perplexed.  Yeah, he doesn't like stuff like this.  Old Dirty does not like Auto-Lock Pro.  Don't waste time with other anti-theft locks.  Get Auto-Lock Pro today.  Police tested.  Cops use it on their own cars.  In fact, Auto-Lock was designed by a former police sheriff. 
[01:50:00]  So, I guess if I see a hoopie that I want to get with the Auto-Lock,  I'm going to have to move on to the next talk.  Move on.  You're going to have to pass.  Word up.  If your car's ever stolen with Auto-Lock attached,  Auto-Lock will pay you up to $1,000 towards your deductible  and $1,000 reward for information on cars stolen while Auto-Lock is attached.  Now, that's confidence.  But we can still get the airbag.  So that's a smooth G.  Wait a minute.  You guys are stealing airbags, do you think?  Airbags are hot.  Come on. 
[01:50:30]  Airbags are hot.  Why?  I was going to say, because the little one needs a mattress.  You might even get an insurance break for using Auto-Lock.  Before you park your car tonight, buy an Auto-Lock Pro at Strauss Autobahn  or Pep Boys at Strauss Autobahn or Pep Boys.  Auto-Lock.  It works guaranteed.  The Cruel Circus.  Ron and Fez.

Oh, and you see the Ultimate V right on the front.  I thought it was the pouch.  No, well, you know, it forms the letter V.  I understand.  The five pounder?  Oh, nice.  But that's not what we're talking about.  If they've been around a while, it looks like a W. 
[01:52:00]  That's pretty bad.  Yeah.  That's loose.  If you want to increase...  And it's a loopsy W, too.  That you used to make when you were like eight years old.  That's a loopsy loop.

I'm kind of excited here.  We got Vince and Nikki from Motley Crue in the studio.  Yes.  Hey.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  They got a new book out, an autobiography called The Dirt. 
[01:54:00]  Just debauchery.  Unbelievable.  Reading through that thing.  I mean, some of this stuff, the sex ploy that you guys are going through.  And we should just back up and have Vince tell the story he just told us during the commercial.  Oh, yeah.  We were telling them.  We're like, look at us trying to brag about some of the stuff we've had girls do in here.  And look who we're talking to.  Right.  I mean, nothing.  We were talking about the wiffle ball bat challenge.  There's the wiffle ball bat, by the way.  Where is it?  Stinky.  Stinky.  Hand over the bat to Vince and Nikki. 
[01:54:30]  This bat is...  Is a bat called Stinky?  It should be.  This bat has been used...  Where's the line?  Well, there's...  How many girls have tried that one, Stink?  Three or four?  Four.  Four, right.  Four so far.  That's it?  That's the line?  That's the winning line so far.  Yeah, that was Nikki Sterling.  Pam Anderson.  Who's up?  Oh, my God.  Oh, we're going to have fun today.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Take the gloves off.  But then they had their challenge that they used to put girls do. 
[01:55:00]  Well, I'm going to ask them if they're impressed by the bat.  It's encased in glass.  It's kind of like a Joe DiMaggio bat.  It's actually encased in plastic, which is even better.  It's nice and cheap.  Well, we do with the best we can here.  Right.  All right, go ahead.  It is stinky.  Yeah.  Are you smelling it?  I can smell it, man.  That's not terrible.  Oh, that's dense.  That's mean, man.  Yeah, they were talking about a challenge that they used to do with girls.  Big double-dun dildo?  We had a big double-headed dildo.  Probably about, I don't know, it's got to be two feet long. 
[01:55:30]  Is that about two feet long?  Yeah.  About two feet.  We tie a $100 bill to the middle of it, get two girls.  Whoever reached that $100 the first year, first, won the $100.  God, it was a...  Can we ask your permission to steal that?  You've got it.  We've got to call it the...  Motley Crue Challenge.  Yeah.  The Motley Crue Challenge.  We will do the Motley Crue Challenge very soon.  We'll be very proud.  Thank you.  Don't call it the Vince and Mickey double-dildo.  Don't do that.  I think it's different.  That just sounds wrong. 
[01:56:00]  It sounds wrong, yeah.  So whose idea was it to write the book?  You guys have got to be insane.  I mean, it was kind of like one of those...  Something that's had to happen.  ...about time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Things where...  Because we had a book out.  It was like the first 10 years.  And then we didn't have one out, you know, that we actually did, you know, since then.  But there's been a lot of books out, you know, about us.  But, you know, we had nothing to do with any of them.  We decided to do, like, the real, real story.  And from when we were kids, all the, you know, kind of like individual story. 
[01:56:30]  Mickey, you had an effed-up upbringing.  That's what I learned from the book.  Yeah, a bit.  You know, everybody had a thing.  And it's kind of what made Motley Crue who we are.  Right.  It's pretty cool to read it.  I mean, I learned stuff.  You know, I didn't know Mick tried to hang his brother.  Right.  Now all those notes he used to write to us about killing us, actually.  That's pretty scary to do.  And you guys are open with the stories.  We wrote down a few of the stories that just made us laugh our you-know-what off. 
[01:57:00]  I don't even know how I could say this on the radio.  How you guys used to stick your junk in burritos to get the smell of you-know-what off yourselves.  Oh, yeah.  Me and Nicky would be, you know, we had girlfriends.  And so we...  Well, I mean, we had to live.  Yeah.  So you're sapping off the girlfriends.  We'd be at it at night.  We'd be at, like, the Whiskey or the Rainbow.  And what was the name of that place you used to stuff at? 
[01:57:30]  Noggles.  Noggles.  Noggles on Western and...  Santa Monica Boulevard.  And Highland.  Yeah.  Yes.  That was in Del Taco.  It was open 24 hours a day.  And the only way you could think of getting the smell off of you, because girls know that smell.  Yeah.  Is get an egg burrito.  And, of course, we didn't eat...  We didn't...  We couldn't eat...  You know, what we'd do is steal change, like, people's tip change.  Yeah.  Or, like, we'd get, like, money from a girl to go buy a drink, and we'd keep the change, 
[01:58:00]  and we'd have, like, 99 cents.  So we'd pull it together, take a couple bites of the burrito so we had something to eat at  least that day.  Yeah, you don't want to eat it afterwards.  No, no, it's all bad then.  And then we would, you know, just slide it on there and kind of kill the smell.  Yeah.  I tried it with an orange once, and it backfired on me.  Jesus Christ, but didn't they wonder why it smelled like burrito?  Well, it's kind of a...  It's kind of smelled like what we smell like.  Oh, okay.  And eggy and musky. 
[01:58:30]  We were very tasty anyway.  Well, the phones are just going nuts here.  Candy!  Yeah.  What's going on?  I have a question for Nicky.  Okay.  I don't want to bring down the whole thing.  I know you guys are laughing and everything, but when you died, I just wanted to know if  you remembered anything about it.  I know you said you woke up and there was a pool of blood in your hand and all that,  but do you remember anything about being dead? 
[01:59:00]  Oh, God.  You know, instead of bringing everybody down, I'll just say read the book.  You know, it's been on VH1 and stuff.  But there's a lot in the book about, you know, the band's exploit with drugs and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys had the best behind the music by far.  And the book, really, is that on steroids times a thousand.  This is like the book is behind the beat.  Yeah, there's so much more than they could put on TV.  Yeah, they couldn't.  Yeah.  I mean, they even said, you know, that they need to do like a three or four hour special 
[01:59:30]  on it.  Yeah.  I can't.  What was the deal with the not showering and then seeing which girls or how many girls  you can get to give you BJs?  Without showering?  I mean, that.  That's disappointing.  I hate that point.  I love these stories, though.  It's so quick.  Come on, tell me you haven't done that.  What, not showered?  Yeah.  Look at us, man. 
[02:00:00]  No.  Look at us.  We're not rock stars.  We've got to make sure we're nice to play.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know.  The things you do.  You know, the things you do.  Who won?  Did you have like a little competition going on?  There is no winner in that situation.  No.  No.  Even losers can be winners.  I mean, what the hell?  I couldn't imagine it.  And then reading about the apartment you guys were in.  It just sounds like a party.  Yeah, we were talking about your apartment earlier in the show.  You guys didn't have toilet paper.  Yeah, that's right. 
[02:00:30]  So you used like band flyers and stuff to clean up?  Yeah.  Anything we could.  Socks.  You know, and then we put them back in the other guy's drawer.  You know what it was?  It was Animal House.  Yeah.  From Hell.  And you still got girls.  That's what amazed me.  Reading that chapter.  Because you're in a band like that.  You get about it.  But they weren't really happening yet.  So, you know, three, you know, we're actually four losers in Hollywood that, I mean, we were  playing like, you know, the whiskey and we had a good following.  But, you know, I would be like, we would play the whiskey and go-go and we lived, you know, 
[02:01:00]  maybe a hundred yards up the street.  And I'd be like the Pied Piper, man.  I'd go after the show, everybody, let's go back to, you know, our place and let's go  party.  That'd be, the club would empty.  We'd be 300 people walking behind me and Nikki and the guys and up to the apartment.  And we're talking about a two-bedroom apartment.  Yeah.  And 300 people.  No, yeah.  It was great.  It was funny.  Yeah, we didn't, we didn't, we really had that, that, that Sex Pistols attitude of no  future because we didn't really think anything about, we were like living in the moment. 
[02:01:30]  We would, you know, Vince would like come stumbling through it.  I'd say, hey, check this song out.  And he's like, what's it called?  I'd go, Shout at the Devil.  And we'd just start jamming on it.  Next night we'd play it on stage.  Wow.  It was just like this, it was this wild thing that was in motion and it was unstoppable.  We never, we never really knew.  And this is the first time that we've actually stopped to reflect.  And it took three years to write the book.  But we're actually like on a two-year hiatus for Motley Crue.  And it's the first time we've had a break in really 20 years. 
[02:02:00]  When did you, when did you guys finally realize like, oh my God, we're kind of doing very  well now, you know, and getting out of that crap on, on pieces of paper around the apartment  and on your socks and whatnot.  You know, I think.  When did you buy toilet papers?  Yeah.  When did we, well, I think we started stealing it first.  It was like, no, there had to be a point where you just said like, wow, this might be  working.  From there, we were pretty much on a nonstop tour.  I mean, we, with the Shout the Devil record, we were on tour for almost two years. 
[02:02:30]  I mean, straight.  We didn't have to do some headlining stuff.  And then we went out with Ozzy.  Then after Ozzy, we went and started headlining arenas by ourselves.  Were you getting paid?  Oh yeah, we were getting paid.  You couldn't spend your money.  I mean, we, I lived in an apartment with Robin Crosby that had no furniture.  And I left and like Ben said, two years later, I came home and basically the cat was dead.  No one said the cat. 
[02:03:00]  And, you know, it was just, it was demented.  You know, we didn't think anything about it.  When we left on tour, we never knew it was going to turn into what it turned into.  And, you know, for us to, to, to be able to just, we never got to stop and reflect.  And, you know, part of that's, you know, you have to like look at the managers and the record companies.  They go, you know what guys, just keep bringing in our 15%.  Right, right.  Keep you out on tour, man.  And just don't, don't check the records.  You won't see that anybody's getting ripped off, you know.  And we went back and, and we, you know, reflected on everything and audited everything. 
[02:03:30]  And, and everything's good now.  You lost a lot though.  No, we didn't.  Oh, you didn't, no, we made, you know.  It was all right.  There's a lot of hard stories out there with bands.  Yeah.  I mean, the, the, what were the mistakes that we made, like early on is like pretty much like most bands do.  You know, we'll, you know, trash the hotel room, throw the TV out onto a brand new Mercedes, you know.  It's all good.  Who cares?  We're rock stars, you know.  What, what, what's 20 grand, you know.  And then, you know, but you don't need, no one brings up the money until after the tour.  You go, okay, you know, you know, how about a little something. 
[02:04:00]  And they go, well, that Mercedes cost you, you know, it's 40 grand damages, the TV,  you had to pay for it, the window was broken.  And multiply that by the three months.  Right, right.  Yeah.  And you go, oh, man, look at all the money we waived for.  Yeah.  We had fun.  I thought that stuff was free.  Yeah.  That was a perk.  You never heard about people paying for it, yeah.  You only heard about them doing it.  People do.  You know, you got to pay for it.  Well, Anthony, we're just getting started.  You guys get hanged a little bit, right?  Yeah, man.  We got a girl here.  We're hoping she'll do the Whistleball Bet Challenge for you guys.  That's like, they're going to be like, who cares? 
[02:04:30]  I know.  After reading the book, we got to, do you guys got a $100 bill?  Yeah, look at us.  Maybe $20.  We can jump in.  We'll pitch in.  We'll pitch in.  We'll spot a little bit.  I just want to say the book is unbelievable, The Dirt.  And you guys are going to do a book signing tonight?  Yeah, yeah.  Tonight, Virgin Megasaur.  Yeah.  I think it's a couple hours ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Okay, around 7 o'clock or something?  7 o'clock.  Yeah, I think 7 to 9.  All right.  So the book's out today.  It's a pretty exciting moment.  Oh, without a doubt.  If you want to talk to the guys, 212-757-1027. 
[02:05:00]  And we'll get Jewel Denial in here as well.  See if we can get anything out of her, right?  Cool.  Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd inject a little intelligence into this conversation here.  Yeah, there's no place on this show.  I know that.  O.P.S.  More stupidity on the way.  And we have Vince and Nikki in the studio. 
[02:05:30]  From Motley Crue, Anthony.  Old Dirty's getting to know Vince and Nikki.  Wait, talk into the mic.  We asked Old Dirty if he ever listened to Motley Crue. 
[02:06:00]  And we found out you have no clue who they are, right?  Yeah, but they got a book.  You know what I mean?  Crash the Ferrari, the chick.  You let a girl of a plane mate drive a Ferrari.  Actually, I went up to the Playboy Mansion.  Oh, man.  He hangs at the mansion.  The Midsummer Night's Dream Party where everybody, all the girls wear lingerie and all the guys  have to wear like, basically wear bathrooms and boxer shorts.  And the playmate of the month, that month, in her thing, in her, you know, they ask the questions 
[02:06:30]  in the centerfold.  And she goes, you know, her main thing in life was to marry a rock star.  Poor girl.  I'm in.  I'm in.  So I cruise up there and I'm in my Ferrari and I go, hey, yeah, I'm your rock star.  Let's go.  So, okay.  Oh, Wendy.  When are you able to say that?  Yeah.  Damn.  So we bail out of the mansion.  We go down to this club.  You know, she's still in her underwear and I'm in a bathrobe and we're having a good time. 
[02:07:00]  Sunset Boulevard, you know, $300,000 Hesterosa.  Yeah.  And so we, I'm living at a hotel because I've just gotten a divorce.  And so she goes, you know, another point of my fantasy is to drive a Ferrari.  And I'm like, you know, I'm buzzing.  I'm like, all right, whatever.  You know, she gets in it.  We go down Sunset Boulevard.  She makes a right.  All of a sudden, she makes another right and it's like a lot of water.  She just guns it.  And the car just spins out of control, slams head first into a car. 
[02:07:30]  And then it just like piles up backwards into a truck.  And I get out and I'm pissed.  I'm like, you, dude.  Blah, blah, blah.  She's sitting there on the curb, you know, in her underwear and crying.  The cops come.  They arrest her.  They take her to jail.  I'm like, she did look pretty hot.  You know what I mean?  That's a killer right now.  So I went and I bailed her out of jail.  That's not bad.  Don't forget it.  All right.  Yeah, bring Jewel Den Island here. 
[02:08:00]  Let's see what she's about.  Mike, what's going on?  How you guys doing?  Good.  Hey, Nicky and Vince.  Yes, you guys are.  I have to say, I got the book yesterday and it is awesome.  I'm halfway through it already.  How good is the dirt?  It's great, right?  Oh, my God.  It's so good.  Everything.  You guys are sick, man.  Oh, boy.  You guys did some crazy stuff.  What's your favorite story so far?  My favorite story was actually a couple of you guys spoke about.  But just where they lived and how they, you know, would bring all these guys back to their  house, 300 people and party up.  And guys, you seem like you did it constantly, like for so many days in a row. 
[02:08:30]  Living the life.  Years.  Years.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just incredible stuff, man.  But I'm just at the part now where you guys all kind of, you know, just went through your  rehabs and got yourself straightened out.  And like how awake you guys all felt about doing Dr. Phil good and all that.  Cool.  Good stuff, man.  Real good stuff.  It definitely was a good read.  All right, Mike.  Thanks.  All right.  Yeah, the guys are doing a book signing at Virgin Megastore right after they leave us  today.  You guys no more drinking or anything?  Any more of you guys?  Yeah, right.  I do not.  The Margarita. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, see?  We were wondering about that.  Yeah, we kind of fell off the wagon and forgot to get back on.  The wagon just, the wagon kept going.  The wagon kept going, you know.  He said, another decade, we'll jump on it again.  You want a Sam Adams or something?  Want a beer?  Because I can use one.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Stinky.  Got a few beers.  Got some beer.  See, I wanted a beer earlier.  And then Ben goes, dude, I don't know if those guys, like, you know.  Like, why?  Oh, God, that's cool.  You want a boat?  Yeah, sure. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, what the hell, man?  Let's go.  Here we go.  All right.  Party started.  You know what I need to know more about is the main lining of alcohol that was touched  on during the behind the music.  Right.  How do you get to that point where logically you're like, hey, this is cool.  Let's try it.  This is a great idea.  You know what?  When you're really, like, whacked out of your brain and you want to come down and you don't  have anything left, that's, you know, your brain just says, why not? 
[02:10:00]  But drinking it doesn't work?  Well, you think about drinking it and you think about, you know, putting it straight in  the vein.  I mean, that makes sense to me.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking, yeah, I'm thinking kind of rationally.  I'm just like, there's something in the mood.  I mean, why do you want to wait for it to go down your throat, into your stomach, into  your stomach?  Just get it over with.  Because, like, maybe there's a filtration system that takes out certain things.  No, we're in the crew.  Jesus Christ.  Now, who do we got in the studio here?  This is Jewel Denial.  Hey.  Where are you from, Jewel? 
[02:10:30]  Los Angeles.  No, I mean, like, what's your gig?  Fox Magazine.  Fox Magazine?  Do adult movies.  Right.  Cool.  With everything.  You know the guys from Motley Crue a little bit?  Actually, I was supposed to shoot at Vince's house like a month ago, but the shoot got  canceled.  Uh-oh.  I was supposed to be shooting movies.  Oh, Randy's thing.  Yeah.  Randy's thing.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you got going on here?  Wait a minute.  Randy went to jail.  Porn stars are shooting at your house?  He went to jail?  Yeah.  You went to jail?  No, Randy.  The whole thing got screwed up because one of the guys believed that I was supposed to 
[02:11:00]  have sex with.  The guy I was supposed to have sex with in your house?  Uh-huh.  Went to jail.  Vince, are you renting out your house for porno movies?  Yes.  How bad has it gotten, Vince?  I agree.  Why not?  Wow.  I was all stoked, like all happy, like, yeah, this is going to be fun.  But who's Randy?  Randy's a buddy of mine.  Yeah.  Okay.  And Randy's actually a movie, a legitimate movie, not illegitimate, but a movie producer.  Yeah.  And then he was doing some stuff and he goes, he needs to put me... 
[02:11:30]  Is there like a friend of yours that just came up?  He goes, Vince, you know, I need a house, man.  I got a...  Oh, yeah, sure.  I was supposed to be there doing a scene that day, but it got canned.  What was the name of the movie?  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Didn't have one of those wacky porn names?  You need an openness, thank you.  Hey, we got to ask you about that pictorial in Fox Magazine with the bike chain?  Those are real...  You know what?  I was there doing the shoot and I was just supposed to be hanging from these chains.  And I said, no, I'm a hardcore chick.  These chains got to go.  So I put them in. 
[02:12:00]  Four chain links.  They were the industrial ones you pull a truck with.  Yeah, that's like you lock up a bike with or something.  No, not the ones you lock a bike with.  No, even a motorcycle.  No, you haven't seen the bike chains on the streets of Manhattan.  They got the huge ones now.  They were just like hanging there, so I kind of just put them where they were supposed to go.  You certainly did.  Where they were supposed to go, right.  Now, it's funny you bring that up because we have something we do here on this show.  Yeah, this is...  And we only ask special girls that we think would be capable of doing this.  That's why we've only had four or five girls since January that have done this. 
[02:12:30]  It is called the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  I heard.  You heard what this is all about?  I was sitting out there.  I was just praying.  Why are the monitors up out there?  Yeah, we got it turned on the radio.  I got it right here.  Yeah.  Now, I believe Vince and Nicky are set to give $100.  Oh.  I hope.  Oh, yay.  No, I'm teasing, of course.  I think we could straight up...  You guys said you come up with the grand, remember?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  That's the Motley Crue Challenge we're going to do next week. 
[02:13:00]  We'll do that.  With the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge, we roll a condom on there because it's safe Wiffle Ball  Batting.  And then we put some lube on there.  Stinky knows just how much lube to put on.  So it's easier for the gal.  Yeah.  And you know...  Thanks.  You know Nicky Sterling from the business, right?  Of course, yeah.  She did it.  She's the last one that did it.  Look how I got put on the bat.  And she is so far the record holder.  Yes, she is.  The deep one, huh?  I'd like to ask you now, you would be willing here with the crew in the studio to do the  Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Oh, my God.  Oh, please, please, please, please, please, please. 
[02:13:30]  I hope one of you loves that Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  You guys owe me so big if I do this.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Since you have a pinball.  You don't work it, please help us.  Okay.  You'll do it?  I'll do it, but they owe me.  Yes.  Yes.  Another contestant in the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  I love this.  This is the best challenge.  Look at Stinky getting his gloves right away.  Stinky's perfect.  Well, it's all very, very clinical.  All right.  As Stinky...  You could put it in, or administer it, let's say, any way you want. 
[02:14:00]  Stinky will...  Or, if you want to, if Stinky wants to help, sure, he can.  Yeah, we'll figure out who will apply the effort.  Stinky can help you.  Hey, Greg, what's going on?  I'm getting locked in.  Hey.  What's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Well, we have a party today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I was wondering if any of those dudes caught anything from sticking it to all these drugs.  Yeah, would you have a doctor on call or something?  And, you know, here's a funny story about that.  Yes, man?  Yep.  Back in, what was it?  Remember that it was a... 
[02:14:30]  What tour was that?  Oh, it was a...  Shout?  You know, a theater painter.  Right.  You know, we all had our girlfriends and stuff.  And, you know, we were a bit wild on tour, obviously.  A bit.  A little bit.  And, like, the girls would come out, like, every two weeks.  And so, every two weeks, we'd have a doctor there.  And every two weeks, we'd be lined up in the shower.  With our pants down, around our ankles, with a doctor, give us the biggest penicillin shot.  And we had so many of them. 
[02:15:00]  I mean, if we ever caught anything, it wouldn't have worked anyway.  Right.  You'd build up an immunity to it or something.  Or resistance.  Well, the problem...  And we'd be living on stage, you know, because a needle goes into your hip.  The real problem was you're not supposed to drink for, like, what, 24 hours after you get the penicillin shot.  So, you know, obviously, the penicillin never worked.  You know what I mean?  The doc shoots him up.  I'm not feeling anything.  The doc, you know, the Jack Daniels.  I need a beer for this, by the way.  Oh, yeah, get her, Sam.  Yeah, these guys are...  It's like my great-grandfather used to say, drink, Sam Adams, you'll take the wiffle ball bat challenge. 
[02:15:30]  Yes, exactly.  We love Jim Cook.  That's the new motive.  Sam says...  Karen, what's going on?  I'm Jim Cook.  Hi.  Hi, Karen.  Am I on the air?  Yes.  Just want to tell you guys, you are so awesome.  And, Nikki, I love you.  You're the best.  Thank you.  When are you guys going back on tour again?  Yeah, a lot of people want to know when you're going to get the original lineup back together and give it a ride.  We're, like, on a two-year hiatus right now, just getting, you know, kind of getting away from it. 
[02:16:00]  We've been doing it for 20 years, so it's going to be a while.  But, yeah, we'll definitely make more music and more tours and more...  All right, Karen, thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  I think he's almost ready.  I think he looks like he's posing for his little-y picture.  What the hell is that?  He's got his glums on.  Thank you.  Purple batting gloves.  Purple batting gloves, yeah.  Don't smudge the marks from the other contestants.  Okay.  It's covered with a protective...  Yes.  Condom.  Yeah, with a condom.  Tom wants in here.  Tom, what's up? 
[02:16:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know, the behind the music, I just could not pull myself away from.  I think I'm going to lose three days' sleep.  From not being able to pull myself away from this book.  Behind the music was great, but the book, it just takes it to a whole new level.  I should say it on the air.  I was telling these guys while we were in commercials.  I try to read a lot of these rock books.  Most of them suck.  They don't really tell you much.  It's the softcore version.  It seems like someone else wrote the book for the bands and stuff.  These guys just let it all out. 
[02:17:00]  God bless the crew, man.  High school, you guys rock.  College, you guys rock harder.  I mean, you guys are awesome.  And I just hope you still put out music like 10, 15, 20 years down the line.  Right on, man.  Go get the book, all right?  Absolutely.  It's called the dirt.  And also, I should say, as we're almost ready for this, that the gang is going to be at  Virgin Megastore today, right after this interview, if you call us an interview.  Now, we're on the air. 
[02:17:30]  But that's what we do.  We drink beers and, like, we don't care.  I hope someone listens to this.  Whipple ball bat.  Hey, Julie, you need to plug anything?  Oh, gee, who's going to touch that one?  Let me think.  No, I'm just here with, you know, I'm in the new issue of July's issue of Fox Magazine.  I have a big layout, and I'm in there every month.  Yeah, we like the chain pictures, like you were saying.  Yeah.  Now, your movies, I see you're not...  I've got some movies there, yeah.  You're not against the backdoor action.  No, I do DP's, double penetration.  DP? 
[02:18:00]  DP's in the business.  Yeah, the DP.  Oh, be the DP.  Then she into the DP's.  Anybody in the crew ever get a girl and pull a DP on her?  He's a producer and a performer, too, and I did a lot of action stuff with him in the  magazine as well.  Oh, really?  He's down here, in fact.  A performer.  I'm shooting a layout with him tomorrow.  Are you?  For Fox.  That's why he's here.  So he's going to be F-ing you?  Yep.  There you go.  And do you guys know each other a little bit?  A little.  Just a tiny bit?  Does he F your A?  Yes, of course.  You know he's back there picking his nose.  Yeah, it's good.  I swear to God. 
[02:18:30]  Does he shoot hot C on your face?  Of course.  Does he get to T-F you?  Yes.  Do you suck at C until he sees all over your face?  This is a radio show.  Settle down.  I'm getting fluffy, man.  I love the alphabet.  Anything going into the A?  Right now?  No.  Tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Does he use a condom when he does that?  No, no, no.  No, I hate that, too. 
[02:19:00]  I don't use condoms.  Takes away from the movie.  Condoms?  Okay, excuse me.  Why am I going to use it?  It doesn't make perfect sense.  Of course it does, babe.  Why are you going to wear a condom if you're going to do that?  I mean, we're tested every 30 days.  I mean, give me a break.  Well, look at you.  I hear you.  No problem.  Hey, you don't have to sell me.  I hate the condoms.  I hate them.  They're off.  They're off.  Are you ready?  What?  Should we...  What, am I supposed to sit in the chair?  Well, you know, we've got some options here. 
[02:19:30]  You want to go right on that counter?  We've had many a girl on that counter.  Do it right on the console.  Just slide the mic away a little bit.  Hop up on there.  We've had a couple hood piercings right at that spot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  I kind of forgot that Vince and Nicky are here.  I did, too.  He goes, he's going to hop up on the console.  All right, hold on.  I don't believe we've ever had the whiffleball bat challenge done on the console, though. 
[02:20:00]  Usually it's in a chair.  There she goes.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, Vince, you might want to get around and take a better look.  That's good.  I like her technique, Anthony.  Yeah.  God, I can't see anything.  I have to sacrifice this.  Well, Opie's over there, and he'll get the description.  No, you should get to that mic.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, Opie.  No argument here.  But she is going for the record, after all.  All right.  There's a guy out there eating a hamburger. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, there is a guy outside the studio just eating a hamburger, looking in.  I just want to let everyone know that Vince and Nicky are just watching this procedure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Somebody do it.  Somebody do it.  They're stinky.  Now, be nice, thank you.  All right, hold on.  Be gentle.  Okay, hold on.  Okay.  Anthony?  All right.  It won't shock you?  No.  Have you had sex with interracial sex on your films?  I'm doing my first one.  Oh, you are?  Is the black gentleman very well-endowed? 
[02:21:00]  Mr. Marcus.  It's like, oh, I know Mr. Marcus.  He was over for a...  Of course.  All right.  Stinky's going.  You know what?  Have you bottomed down, Stinky?  I think so.  Whistle around.  Put it into third gear.  You might get...  No.  You know, you never slam the bottom of the back.  No.  You're not tamping soil.  Yes, Stinky.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with Stinky?  She doesn't even know that.  She's telling Stinky how to get it done.  All right.  There's an angle in there, right? 
[02:21:30]  Wow.  She's still got another inch to go before the record.  What do you think?  Can you do it?  Hold on, Anthony.  You might have to use the Nicky Sterling technique.  Ah, that was the one Nicky Sterling actually bent over forward and, yeah, from...  I'm not questioning your expertise.  I think she might have to take her top off for...  There we go, Stinky.  Anthony, should she take...  Now you're rocking.  Should she take her top off for this, sir?  I don't know, Opie. 
[02:22:00]  What do you think you're asking me for?  No!  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  B, he tried the wrong...  Stinky hit the wrong target.  Oh, my God.  Stinky.  All right.  Keep going.  You're fine.  Oh, we almost have a record.  Oh, my.  There we go.  Almost there.  Almost there.  Almost there.  Wait, still good?  Hold on.  Let's ask her.  Are you all right? 
[02:22:30]  She's all right.  Keep going.  I'm going to do a conselectomy.  How are we looking?  Yes, slide.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  See, nice.  Here's the mark, Stinky.  Get the marker, Stinky.  Get the marker.  Now, see?  That's a balloon knot.  All right.  Stinky's marking now.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Okay.  Nice.  Nice.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  Thank you.  Stinky.  The wrong target.  She took position, too, and he said, you're going the wrong way.  Stinky, how do you confuse that?  She goes, wait a minute.  How's the record look?  Yes, Stinky.  How are we looking?  Do we have a new Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge record?  No.  He's short of the record, but...  He was in third. 
[02:23:30]  I'm in third place.  In third?  Third place?  Wow.  Well, after you do the film with the black guy, come back.  I think...  Well, hey, where's Tommy Lee?  We've seen those movies.  What did you guys think about that whole thing when I came out and...  Well, I think Vince was pissed because he had a little movie out there, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it just didn't sell as much as Tommy.  I didn't talk about it.  I wanted to say, you know, it came out.  I wanted to go right away.  But everybody that saw the Pam and Tommy video was just like, oh, my God. 
[02:24:00]  Look at what this guy's sporting.  You know?  The Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge on Pam.  I think she'd do very well.  She's had the Wiffle Ball before.  Oh.  I see a little tension with Pam.  No, no.  We don't have nothing against Yoko.  Ow.  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh.  Oh, that's hard, George. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  Why'd you say that, Vince?  You're just beating to it.  Yeah.  Was that a problem?  I mean, obviously it was.  In what way did you F things up?  Read the book.  Yeah.  All right.  I got you.  No, believe me, I will.  Damn women.  Yeah, you chick.  We're screwing it up when the guys want to hang out.  Hey, we want to take more phone calls and stuff.  Do you guys got to get out of here?  We got a little tongue.  Yeah, look at you.  They're not leaving after what we just showed up. 
[02:25:00]  I was going to say, they owe me.  And, of course, Jewel Denial in the studio.  She's in the latest issue of Fox Magazine.  And she's going to be getting pounded by that guy.  What's your name, man?  Luciano.  Luciano?  You do a lot of porno?  Throw him on the mic real fast.  A lot.  Yeah, I do quite a bit, actually.  Yeah, the yes word.  Yeah, they don't like you.  We thought we had a great life.  Yeah, this guy's just a boy.  What do you mean to do?  What kind of hardcore stuff?  My stuff's all like, you know, backdoor in the face. 
[02:25:30]  Can I say?  I can't.  I'm afraid to say.  You know what?  Yeah.  Well, you can just have backdoor.  Everyone knows where that is.  Just use the letters.  Just think of the hardcore adult movies.  That's what I do pretty much.  Nothing soft about it.  Nothing nice about it.  Let me see on that spankture vision in the hotels.  No homebanks.  Spankture vision.  I hate that stuff.  You go to the hotel and you're like, oh, yeah, they're porno.  And you turn it on.  It's nothing.  That's boring.  You go to bed.  Fuck.  I don't want 20 minutes of a guy's face going, oh, oh, you know? 
[02:26:00]  Show me some action.  The way I look at it is if you're going to go see a rent adult movies, I want to see something  done to a woman that I can't do to mine, you know?  So it's like some lady lying on her back in bed.  I mean, you could do that at home, you know what I mean?  Did you ever see Slap Happy?  Yeah, that's actually the same company.  That's a good friend of mine.  Oh, yeah?  We have the whole collection in the back, guys.  You ever see Slap Happy?  No.  This is the thickest hardcore video.  It's a guy, and his junk is pretty big.  And he grabs these girls by the head, and they consent to this. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, there's a whole thing at the beginning of the video of how they have no problem with  this, and they love it.  They're very submissive.  And he jams so hard, as they're giving the B, the BJ, that they start vomiting all over  the guy's junk, just like, wham, slamming.  I shot a couple of them, actually.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, his brain's a good friend of mine, and yeah, he literally tells them before.  He's going to bow to you, man.  He told them.  That's his favorite collection.  He goes, if you're going to consent to this, it's going to be like the worst 10 minutes of 
[02:27:00]  your day.  Yeah.  Do they have to, like, eat a special meal or something?  Yeah, what do they eat?  Because it all looks like the same green pea soupy stuff that comes out.  Well, I don't think they believe it's going to be to that extreme.  It's like bile.  It doesn't, but, yeah.  They discontinued, actually, that series, because a lot of distributors wouldn't take it anymore.  So.  Collector's item.  There you go.  But it's different than anything else, you know?  It sure is.  And then they paint, they paint, like, the C-word on the girls' heads.  Horrible.  You know, four, and they call, and they smack her in a face.  There's a degrading wind. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, it's really sick.  It's pretty disturbing to watch.  It's pretty disturbing.  See, have you seen this guy in the Slap Happy series?  There's lots of slapping in this.  Would you like him to get naked so he can see if you've seen him in the Slap Happy movie?  Hey, Jim Norton, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  We're hanging with Vince and Nicky from Motley Crue.  We got Jewel in here that just did the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge, and some guy that's  a hardcore sex stuff.  Yeah, no, no, Motley Crue, yeah.  Yeah.  What did you say, Jim?  I don't know.  I think that got dumped out of. 
[02:28:00]  What did you say?  I said I want to congratulate Lou Gehrig on shoving the...  You can't say that.  Jim, maybe you ought to brush up on those SPC rules and regs, because that word is the  A-bomb.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, did he clean it up for the radio, or...?  Well, I know you came in third place behind Mabel King in the Holland Tunnel, so congratulations.  All right, Jim, thanks.  With the guys from Motley Crue, I saw you guys in, I think it was 83, what was that, Ozzy's 
[02:28:30]  Buck at the Moon Tour?  Yep.  Very nice.  All right.  That's my whole contribution to this show.  Thanks, Norton.  Thank you, Eddie, fellas.  Yeah, really.  All right, we'll take more phone calls for the guys.  It's Vince and Nicky in the studio.  The new book is really good.  It's called The Dirt.  They're doing a book signing at Virgin Megastore in a little while, so...  About 9 o'clock at this now.  Yeah, it might be a little late, of course, at all.  I'm going to hang out here for a while.  All right, cool.  Well, you want another beer?  You threw that one at a man?  Good for now? 
[02:29:00]  All good?  Virgin Megastore in Times Square tonight with Vince and Nicky.  Hey, Anthony, show me beverages.  Hey.  The leader in healthy refreshment, Bobby.  Jesus Christ.  I'm holding the vibro-sensual feel, Le Grand Duet.  It's Jules' signature sex toy.  Yeah, I have a few.  I have my mold, too, but I forgot to bring it. 
[02:29:30]  Are there two in the package?  Because I'm looking at two of these in the package.  They both vibrate.  And is that to use on just one girl at the same time?  Sure.  Could you demonstrate this maybe after we come back?  No.  One of us, because I already promised that to the girl upstairs, Samantha.  Oh, I think she'd feel okay.  We'll give her a ticket or something.  I promised her I'd give it to her.  And besides, I didn't end them yet, so we don't want any mess.  Okay, so be right here.  That went good with my fries. 
[02:30:00]  At least you don't have a chocolate shake.  Well, you guys want to know what really goes on.  That's what you have to do.  Nikki was sipping on his soda when she said that line.  Yeah, you've got to clean yourself out.  Yeah, it's part of the business.  You guys want to know that's what you do.  It's like behind the scenes.  Exactly.  Behind the porno.  Behind the porno.  Right.  Well, I've seen a couple of movies, lower quality, I guess, where they didn't do that.  And there was a little kid there.  Well, then.  A little milk dud. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, that's not sexy.  Very disgusting.  Well, we also be beverage, especially formulated to uplift the mind, body, and spirit with great  tasting teas and fruit blends that's been enhanced with herbs and other natural supplements.

[02:31:30]  It's the ONH.  We're hanging with Vince and Nikki from Motley Crue and Jewel Denial.  Yes.  Hornstar.  Hello.  Who just completed the Whiffle Ball Back Challenge.  Came in a respectable third.  Third place.  Not bad.  She did pretty well.  And the guys from Motley Crue in.  We're hanging and talking about their new book, The Dirt.  They're doing a book signing today at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square in about 45 minutes.  So get your asses down there to say hi to the guys.  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  And we're trying to brag to them and they're just topping every story we have to tell.  I don't know, man.  You guys are, you guys are hanging in there pretty good.  We were telling them about the lesbian couch outside the studio.  Yeah.  How we get the strange girls that've never had a lesbian experience together to do some lesbian stuff.  And then we were telling them about the egg lady.  Yeah, the egg shooting.  We had a girl in here and she was able to shoot hard-boiled eggs.  Or no, they were raw eggs.  In the shell.  Raw eggs?  Yeah.  Raw eggs.  Now that's talent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The hard-boiled.  Anyone.  Amazing.  But the raw egg, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Without breaking it.  That's the trick.  No, the cool part about it.  She would shoot them out and we would take batting practice.  Yeah, we were doing batting practice.  I guess you've never done that.  Never, dude.  Thank God.  We've got to come here to learn new tricks.  And the bitch high and wide for a ball, too.  Yeah, so we were taking batting practice.  She shot at nine feet, which is pretty good.  And then we had a blind guy in front of her trying to catch the egg.  We were telling him which way to turn and stuff.  There's only so much you can do with it, so we had to figure out other things. 
[02:33:00]  Like, all right, she's shooting at it, but we still want to watch.  All right, get the blind guy.  Try to catch the egg.  Was this on the air?  Oh, yeah.  We didn't hear it.  It was at our house.  So we're telling them that story.  And Nicky's telling us a cute little story about Vince and overseas and ping-pong balls and stuff.  You want to share with the audience?  Yeah, where was that?  It was Japan, right?  Yeah.  It was looking like, thanks.  Hi.  Hi.  We were at some weird club, and there's like a turntable,  and this girl's like spinning around in her back shooting ping-pong balls out of her, you know, whatever. 
[02:33:30]  And, yeah, one of them nailed Vince in the forehead.  So Vince takes that as a sign to go up onto the turntable.  And, you know, she's got...  This is Japanese custom.  Yeah.  So we're sitting there ordering drinks watching our singer go at it, you know,  in the middle of all these Japanese businessmen in their suits and ties.  And we're thinking it's kind of normal, but then we meet you guys.  Yeah, well...  We're totally having sex with this girl on a turntable in front of a crowd.  The businessman in there, I thought that I was part of the show. 
[02:34:00]  Part of the show, yeah.  They were tipping it.  Oh, look at the Yankee goal.  Any Americans in there?  They were kind of like, oh, man, that's Vince.  We're in Tokyo.  We're like in Yokohama or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, we're the Peoria of Japan.  Yeah.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  Yo, what's up, Owen?  How's it going?  We're having a lot of fun.  What's going on there, Nicky?  Vince?  Hey, hey.  Dude, I saw you guys last summer.  It was great.  Even without Tommy, man, you guys still kick a lot of ass.  I was right up front of the first concert. 
[02:34:30]  I took my check to.  It was great.  Thanks, man.  But I heard you got a solo gig going on.  You got a solo record or something coming out, Nicky?  What?  I also heard that Vince was going on tour with the Poison tour this summer.  No.  No.  I'm doing actually just two shows with the Poison, you guys.  That's it.  Actually, it's this weekend, Memorial Weekend.  And that's it for me.  I've been out for like about six weeks right now.  I'm just, you know, I mean, with Motley taking like a couple years off, I just, you know,  just a little bored at home and rounded up a couple buddies and said, 
[02:35:00]  let's go out and tour and race some hell around the country.  Is Mick still part of the, still partying with you guys?  He's still playing or?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, cool.  I mean, like there's nothing, the band's intact.  We're just kind of taking a little bit of a break.  That's cool, man.  And I've got a side project called 58 that's out right now.  So that's kind of a departure musically from crew as well.  Very cool, man.  All right, Scott.  I'm going to hold us into the video.  I hope I see you guys there.  All right.  Right on.  Yeah, Virgin Megastore at 7 o'clock in Times Square with these guys.  John, what's up? 
[02:35:30]  What's up, guys?  Hey, now this is more the story we want to hear.  Go ahead.  Nicky, I love you guys.  Grew up on you.  Wonderful.  Except I have one complaint.  Theater of Bank tour.  Madison Square Garden.  Yeah.  I spent all this money, bring our chick there, take good seats.  Except for one thing.  I didn't leave with her.  She walked away, never came back.  I think, was she with Mick?  What do you mean she walked away?  She walked away. 
[02:36:00]  She walked up towards the stage with her girlfriend.  And me and my buddy were sitting there and basically playing basketball for the rest of the year.  Oh, no.  It's those road crew guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, those guys are notorious for that stuff.  Well, everyone knows the stories about you guys pointing out girls in the audience that you want brought back.  And that stuff went down.  And you just, if they were with guys, you didn't care?  Did you ever talk to her again?  Like a smorgasbord?  Yeah, John, did you ever talk to this girl? 
[02:36:30]  John?  Like one of the centerpieces for Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  Did you talk to her again or no?  After that, yeah, we talked to her about two weeks later.  And she goes, well, you know, we got lost.  Yeah, you got lost.  Oh, we got lost line.  Yeah.  Yeah, you fell for it.  Oh, God.  That was awful.  All right, boys.  Take care.  All right, man.  Thanks, dude.  She came home smelling like an egg burrito.  Kind of a bad thing.  Not with the crew.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Mike.  Yeah.  Turn down your radio. 
[02:37:00]  You're live with the guys.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, how you going?  Yo, crew rules social.  Hey, we're different day parts right now.  That's right.  We're not.  Yo, yo, Anthony.  Yeah.  I mean, Opie, I know your brother Darren.  I'm a comedian.  I perform at Christopher's.  Great.  Him and Patrick see me there all the time.  We always talk about you cats.  Hey.  Patrick.  Hey, wait, wait.  Patrick's a man.  What?  Do you have something for the guys?  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, sorry.  Okay.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, man.  I just said a bunch of Quaaludes. 
[02:37:30]  You got any left?  Yeah, yeah.  I do.  Yo.  Now, Charlotte and Kenanis, what's up to Mickey and Vince?  You guys kick ass.  Crew rules, man.  Better than...  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Poor guy.  Some people just can't get their thoughts together.  It's a loose.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Quaaludes will do that to you.  All right.  Let's try Eddie. 
[02:38:00]  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, how are you?  This guy's on Luz.  Wow.  Eddie, you all right?  I wanted to ask Nicky, because I heard you guys talking about him mainlining whiskey.  How are you doing?  And I've actually done that before.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, what a surprise.  I'm pretty sure it was, like, one of the lowest moments of my life.  Did you just do it?  What?  Just now. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, what are you on right now?  I'm not on anything.  Okay.  So, doing the alcohol right into your arm was the worst moment of your life?  Well, I wouldn't say I was too proud of myself when I was doing that.  And I heard in the beginning of the program, you guys talking about it, Opie said, like,  oh, they were coming off of the H.  And I was like...  I feel like I just did some H with listening to you.  I'm not at all.  I'm like, this guy's so mellow.  So, do you have a point? 
[02:39:00]  I drink...  All right.  I'll bail out if you want me to.  Punch out.  Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.  Did he hang out?  No, no.  I'm here.  All right.  Just ask the guy something.  I just wanted to know, like, what led him to do that?  Being, like, such a rich rock star, like, why would you not have any dope to shoot?  That's a legitimate question.  That's the point.  Well, that's the problem when you're between Johnson City and Peoria in the middle of the night. 
[02:39:30]  You know, there's not a lot of drug dealers out there.  Yeah.  It's hard to find your dope.  Well, that's the most extreme thing you've ever done to get some drugs.  Well, I think that's when we learned to buy it by the kilo.  And the pounds.  You know, we...  Well, we also had...  We had a drug dealer follow this.  We had two drug dealers following the tour bosses.  We smartened up.  Yeah.  It was like drug dealer wars.  Like, one guy, you know, my stuff's better than your stuff.  And they would give, like, big chokes a blow like this. 
[02:40:00]  Wow.  Like, take my stuff.  No, take my stuff.  Fighting over giving it to us.  Like an endorsement deal.  Yeah.  They just want to give it to you so we could go to their friends and go,  Hey, I'm the supplier for the truth.  Did you know the guy?  He followed us.  You know those cars, the Excalibur?  Can you imagine a tour bus going down the middle of nowhere with an Excalibur following?  Yeah, that's not too obvious.  It's not too obvious.  At least you got your priorities straight.  Yeah.  Have the dealer follow you instead of having to shoot up whiskey. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  I'm smart enough.  You guys are unbelievable.  That's great.  I've got to read the rest of this book.  What else did you want to plug, Jewel Denial?  Your video series?  Yeah, I have my own video series, Jewel Denial.  I can't say the other word.  S of Denial.  I've got this right here.  You can say slut.  Sluts of Denial.  Yeah.  Sluts of Denial.  Sluts of Denial.  We learned you can say slut.  You just...  Yeah, read it.  Read it, Vince.  Yeah, read the back of her.  Read the wet panties.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:41:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Come on, let me finish it.  All right, hold on.  You've got to give it the...  Jewel stuff.  All right, hold voice going.  Take two.  Take two, Vince.  You've got to just use the alphabet code.  Every girl dreams about her first B-J.  They're even curious about A-Sex.  What happens when these girls get their way?  Watch Caddy get her first F on film.  What will these curious little girls do when there's no C to be found?  They'll do themselves.  Very dramatic. 
[02:41:30]  Very good.  Yeah.  You're making me want to go see it.  There you go.  I'm going to take him around with me just to endorse my movie.  Will there be a sequel?  I got...  I'm up to number five right now.  To number five.  So unanswered question.  Yeah, the last one was Anal Sluts, and then I did Cream-Filled Sluts, which is all internal  pop shots, and then I did Celebrity...  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Internal pop shots?  I'm hardcore.  I don't mess around, my friends. 
[02:42:00]  No, no.  That's good.  We weren't...  I'm sick of softcore crap porn.  Who isn't?  If you're going to watch it, you're going to watch it and get off.  And I want guys to watch my stuff and get off.  I'm sick of the baloney dialogue and the long, drawn-out crap, the fast-forward stuff.  Get over it.  Yeah.  God.  Yeah.  Amen.  There's a porn star that knows what she wants.  And when you watch myself, it's everything every guy ever dreamed of.  I have Cream-Filled.  I have a movie to keep every guy's fantasy alive. 
[02:42:30]  If more porn stars were like you, this world could be a better place.  I just won two Performer of the Year Awards and Best Boy-Girl Anal Sex Scene and Girl-Girl  Scene.  I thought Regis won that.  Oh, no.  That was Best Game Show Host.  She's an award winner.  I get confused.  Yeah.  I won the Best Anal.  Gelman.  Me and Gelman.  Best Anal.  No, I had a good year because I'm just sick of the other stuff.  You know, people do not want to sit there and watch that crap.  You're right.  Who the hell wants dialogue?  I don't. 
[02:43:00]  You're right to the spanking material.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Okay.  Well, let's...  Well, I couldn't wait to answer that.  Sure.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  O&A.  Yeah.  The crew.  Hey.  Let me ask you guys a question.  I heard this story about that you guys used to pay money to get a mother-daughter-grandmother  combination for sex acts.  Is that true?  Ten grand.  Or that's just an urban legend?  No, ten grand.  I should have picked up.  That's what I heard.  I heard ten grand.  I was in the early days.  Ten was...  Yeah.  This guy I used to work with...  A mother-daughter and we kept popping the ten, so we had... 
[02:43:30]  We had to go up to a mother-daughter-grandma for twenty-five.  And then we had the oldest lady thing, which was something like twenty-five grand.  Yeah.  And there was this...  I remember that we were in Seattle.  We were playing the Coliseum there.  And there was this...  The housekeeping lady came in, and she was like eighty.  And so I called up Thomas.  I said, dude, she's coming down.  You've got to do it, man.  There's a buck right on the line right here.  Oh, that was awful.  He couldn't do it. 
[02:44:00]  Twenty-five thousand dollars just walked in the door.  Yeah, he couldn't do it.  He got down.  No.  We got a video they should check out.  Century sex.  Century sex.  You ever see this?  No.  A woman...  A hundred-year-old woman having sex.  It's century sex.  The woman's body, I swear, it looks like E.T.  Her body, it looks...  When he's laying there, he's all white going...  Yeah, yeah.  The dying E.T.  That's not even the healthy E.T.  It's too E.T.  It's horrible.  She's giving a guy a handy with this translucent skin. 
[02:44:30]  You see every vein pumping, blue blood through.  It's awful, but you've got to say it.  Mick's in there.  I thought it looked familiar.  I totally told you Mick had a porto, didn't we?  Century sex.  I should have known.  No, it has nothing to do with being hot.  It's that freak show thing.  I know.  She's like, that's not hot.  I'm like, no.  Yeah, that's hot.  It's like a car accident.  You've got to stop and look.  Yeah, you've got to kind of take a look at the freak show.  What is that?  It's a freak show.  Ron Jeremy, same thing.  You've got to stop and look.  Well, no, I don't have to look at that. 
[02:45:00]  That's a freak show.  Even though he's a really good friend of mine.  Ah, look at that.  That's a century sex lady, yeah.  Sorry, Loretta Sterling.  Is she related to...  Nikki?  Nikki Sterling?  That's Nikki's grandma.  Great grandma.  Great grandma.  Great grandma.  This is just all wrong.  That's when Vince picks it up.  She was something in the covered wagons going west, I'm sure.  But now she looks a little bit...  For electricity, yeah. 
[02:45:30]  That was the hard wave.  That is hardcore.  That's beyond me.  Would you...  Hey, what's his name again?  I'm sorry.  Luciano.  Luciano.  Would you do something like that?  Absolutely not.  No?  We just found his line.  His edge.  And this guy's sick.  Forget about it.  Well, we've seen what you're packing in this video here.  You'd probably break her hip or something.  Terrible.  The poor woman in traction.  Hey, Louie.  I'm on a big knob and I can't get up. 
[02:46:00]  Louie, what's up?  I would like to ask the crew if they support any type of MP3 sharing or NAFTA for that matter.  NAFTA's so dead now.  It's done now.  Yeah, it's so old.  Well, there's other stuff.  But yeah, I mean, we were very much into that.  I think that any way that you can get your music out to people and, you know, I think that musicians and rock stars or whatever make enough money as it is, man.  Stop trying to get off your every nickel and dime, you know?  Yeah, that put a bad taste in everyone's mouth for Metallica and Lies and everything. 
[02:46:30]  I mean, I think that really did some irreparable damage to that band.  It did.  Because I'm a fan of rock and that was just like, oh, man.  It's cheesy.  Oh, rock.  Okay.  A little heavy metal.  I'm a fan of that, too.  Rock hard.  Andy's got a question.  Andy's got a question for Jewel.  Andy.  Yeah, hey, fellas.  Hey.  Yeah, my question is for Jewel.  Jewel, I was just wondering, she mentioned before, kind of in passing, that she does internal top shot. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  And I just wondered, does that involve some sort of surgery or something?  What is surgery?  Have you ever had sex?  When you have sex, it's when the guy...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Come on, that's clinical.  I can't use, like, technical terms.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm not...  Hold on.  I could say...  It's got to be some kind of a cute, stupid thing that doesn't involve any...  Hot shot?  It could be something else. 
[02:47:30]  You've got to make it so it could be something else.  Yeah, we...  When the girl gets...  When the girl...  When the guy gets excited inside the girl.  I get...  No, no, no.  Hold on.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Hold on, hold on.  We're going to show you how this works, Jewel.  Okay, you say it.  Anthony.  Okay.  Explain it to him.  It's when the guy finishes the job.
