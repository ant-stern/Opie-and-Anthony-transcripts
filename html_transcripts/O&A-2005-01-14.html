<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the repeated phrase "It's everything, all the time," immediately setting a chaotic tone.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, begin by referencing a substantial FCC fine stemming from a past sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Their frustrations with XM Satellite Radio's stringent password security, deemed absurd given their online presence and use of the internet for pornography, are voiced, with the hosts jokingly insulting the "geeks" responsible for the system.  Studio employee Eric is present, noticeably suffering from irritated eyes, possibly a result of recent renovations; his condition becomes a recurring joke throughout the show.  They also discuss the previous day's abrupt show ending, which cut short a phone interview with Joe Rogan mid-story about a powerful psychedelic drug, provoking listener complaints and a debate about technical limitations and XM's inflexible broadcast system.  Martini Steve, Hurricane Ben, and other unnamed staff members are also in the studio.

A significant portion of the show centers on a staged intervention by Steve for Eric, concerning his chronic bad breath. Steve presents Eric with a gift bag of dental hygiene products, much to Eric's embarrassment and the others' amusement.  The hosts and staff react with a mix of teasing and concern, culminating in Eric retreating to the bathroom to use the provided items.  The show also features discussions on Prince Harry's Nazi costume and a caller's Auschwitz experience.  Jim Norton is absent, with Rich Voss filling in.  Norton's comedy CD, "Yellow Discipline," including tracks like "Sex and Racism," is played, prompting discussion on racism and sex, incorporating pre-recorded, humorous, and offensive commentary from Norton.

Multiple listener calls feature prominently.  A "trucker girl" recounts quitting a job due to her boss's bad breath.  Eric's eye is graphically described as red, puffy, and "leaky."  Anthony shares offensive anecdotes about a flight with elderly Jewish people and hitting on a club owner's mother.  The hosts and Voss engage in a vulgar discussion about gambling addiction, sharing personal anecdotes and experiences, including Voss detailing his gambling history and its connection to childhood attention deficit and a need for constant action. A listener shares a story of a roommate's gambling addiction leading to a massive phone bill; the discussion then covers online poker and the ethics of online gambling sites.  The hosts also discuss their website and message boards, addressing listener feedback, both positive and negative, and their feelings about online criticism. They briefly mention World War II propaganda audio clips provided by Eric.

A substantial segment focuses on listener calls describing schemes to cheat at online poker, with callers Danny and Bill detailing methods involving multiple computers and collusion using cell phones.  A contentious interview with "Lady Di" ensues, with the hosts aggressively challenging her credibility and accusing her of lying and alcoholism, ultimately cutting her off. The segment includes anti-Japanese World War II propaganda songs and a discussion about an upcoming NFL game between the Patriots and Colts, with speculation about alleged field manipulation, and a brief discussion about ACC basketball.

A major portion of the show focuses on NFL playoff games, specifically the Jets and Steelers matchup, discussing the Jets’ chances, Chad Pennington's illness (flu and diarrhea), and Belichick's hypothetical use of Pennington's diarrhea to his advantage.  The conversation expands to NFL player hygiene and superstitions, other playoff matchups (Falcons and Vikings), Randy Moss's end zone antics and fine, Joe Buck's reaction, and player celebrations.  Brigitte Nielsen's aging is also discussed.  Mark Patrick, a sports commentator, is a guest.  The conversation moves to MLB's steroid policy, player physique, and baseball announcers' styles.  "Stalker Patty" is noted as absent, and another lengthy and contentious call from "Lady Di" occurs, filled with insults and accusations.  A John Valby song filled with profanity directed at Osama Bin Laden is played, followed by numerous "F.U." calls. Will Arnett is interviewed, and Rich Voss makes a brief appearance. Opie concludes the show by discussing his recent breakup and making self-deprecating jokes.


The broadcast ends with XM Satellite Radio commercials and a "What Did I Learn?" segment.  The hosts discuss negative reviews of *Elektra*,  casting choices for the upcoming Superman movie, and explicit sex scenes from various films like *Monster's Ball* and *Traffic*.  A significant portion is dedicated to *Celebrity Fit Club*, featuring clips and discussions of participants like Daniel Baldwin, Ralphie May, and Mia Tyler, with the hosts criticizing the show as a "freak show."  Opie references his previous interview with Will Arnett. The segment concludes with more XM commercials and crude, sexually explicit listener calls referencing *Celebrity Fit Club* and the movie scenes.  Voss's contribution is acknowledged.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's everything, 24-7, XM-202, the O&A virus, it's everything, all the time. 
[00:00:30]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:01:00]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:01:30]  It's everything, all the time.  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:02:00]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:02:30]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:03:00]  It's everything, all the time.  It's everything, all the time.  It's everything, all the time.  It's everything, all the time.  It's everything, all the time.  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:03:30]  Let's see what we got here.  Let's see what we got here.  I've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story, and I need all of you to stop what you're doing and listen.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back live in New York.  Pay attention.  They spark controversy.  Fuck you!  Being able to do the show we want to do.  Hold on tight, kid.  Jesus fucking Christ!  One of the biggest finds in FCC history is slapped against Opie and Anthony.  We got a couple of great guys over there.  Opie and Anthony have cost our bosses a lot of money.  Yay, beer! 
[00:04:00]  Hold a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  We've learned our lesson, aren't we?  Yeah, we have.  We've learned our lesson.  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks!  I would like to extend to you an invitation to the passport.  Get your cock out.  You know the holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  The beautiful girls...  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:04:30]  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Oh brother.  Oh, stop ہing, stop whining  Stop whining!  Stop whining. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my.  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  Oh, brother.  Let's get right into the show, huh?  Sure.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  How are you?  I'm doing good.  How are you, Anthony?  Very well.  Are you all set over there with your internet and your email and your instant feedback?  I'm on the backup computer. 
[00:05:30]  My primary computer totally cheesed up on me.  And then I had to go through the password thing again where I had to change my password  because it's very secure around here at XM.  Very secure.  You're not allowed to have the same password for more than, I think, 15 minutes.  You have to change it every 15 minutes or something.  Ridiculous.  Why do we have to have secure passwords, you and I?  I don't know.  Do they understand what we use this system for, the internet? 
[00:06:00]  I read the instant feedbacks and pornography.  That's it.  I don't think it has to be all that secure for me.  I don't care if other people use the computer.  We're not trading secret codes to launch missiles.  No.  It's just a computer for instant feedback and pornography.  Why do I have to change the password?  My email account, I've had the same password for probably eight years.  The same.  Eight years, the same password.  Anyone broken in and done anything crazy to it?  Nope.  Of course not.  Not at all. 
[00:06:30]  And you know something?  I know that password like the back of my hand.  With this, you have to change the password.  And it's often enough where you can't remember what your old password was.  Like, I don't know.  I don't know what the username is.  If I had to do it every day, then I'd remember it.  But it's like every couple of weeks, just long enough that you forget what it was.  And I throw a hissy fit.  I think someone's got to tell us what the purpose is.  Computer diva.  I think someone's got to tell us what the purpose is of that.  I don't really get it. 
[00:07:00]  The purpose is, like you said, geeks.  The geeks want to take over the world.  They're geeks.  And they're getting more power every day.  They get into meetings with each other and bosses and decide they have to do this.  They justify parts of their job with it.  They feel superior over everybody by making them change passwords.  You don't have to do that.  I think it's a good idea if we have everyone change their password every two weeks.  Oh, why?  Well, it's more secure that way.  Our system won't be compromised. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, okay.  Their brains are just wired differently than yours.  Yep.  And mine.  Exactly.  You know, I mean, let's be honest.  A message to the geeks out there, we know you're smarter than us.  You don't have to prove it on a daily basis.  You won.  You won.  You don't have to come up with these crazy systems.  We get it.  You're much smarter than us.  Much smarter, much smarter.  You eggheads are much smarter, but getting laid less.  We get it.  We're sorry for banging chicks in high school while you went to your electronics club.  Right.  And the glee club. 
[00:08:00]  And chess club.  And chess club.  And you joined the mathletes.  We get it.  You were one of the first ones to work on computers.  Yeah.  When the computers were as big as rooms.  We understand now.  I remember.  I was very impressed when you printed out that Snoopy image using ones and zeros on  the big piece of paper.  Very impressive.  Sorry, I didn't really get a good look at it, but we were having sex.  But years later, you win.  We were having sex at keg parties. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Right.  That you weren't invited to.  You were home trying to figure out a new computer language.  And now, you're the top dog.  Okay?  You won.  Do we have to change our passwords every two weeks?  Please.  Could you stop that?  Could you get over your rejection?  Could you?  Please?  All right.  Bastard.  Eric's in the studio looking like Ray Charles.  What's going on, Eric?  Not only does he have sunglasses on, he's not even looking at anyone. 
[00:09:00]  He's just looking down.  Because it hurts.  My eye is killing me.  You got the pink eye back?  No.  They're going crazy.  Whenever they do some kind of installation instruction in this place, my eyes go nuts.  And they put all the new shades and everything yesterday, and my eye just lost it.  See?  Jesus.  What's wrong with you?  It's all red.  Why don't you go home, man?  You should go to an ophthalmologist or something.  Okay.  Is it leaking? 
[00:09:30]  It's tearing a little bit.  I just put new drops in there.  Did you go to an eye doctor?  Everyone's just moving away from him.  I did last time.  But I'm still using the same medicine.  Maybe you should go to an eye doctor.  Eyes are kind of important.  It's not like fingers where if you lose one, it's okay.  You lose one.  Oh, well.  You lose a finger, you're like, meh, I got plenty more.  As long as it's not a thumb, who cares?  But one eye, it's like, you know, the old 757, you lose an engine.  You know, there's some concern there because now you only have one. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Oh, you can make it around.  Probably be able to land.  Everything will probably work out fine.  But you must really get concerned with that second engine.  You'll bump into a few things, but you'll make it around.  Right.  Yeah, you won't have any depth perception.  But who needs depth perception?  When you hit something, you're close to it.  I've been bumping into stuff.  I bumped into the elevator, into the door, because I've got to keep that one eye shut  all the time.  It's hard.  It's from the dust? 
[00:10:30]  Whenever they do something that involves drilling into the ceiling or into the walls,  my eye goes crazy.  I don't know what's in it, what's in the air, but I haven't had this since October.  Really?  It was the last time that I had this, when they were doing all the major construction for  the studio across the way.  But now that they did this, my eye's all messed up again.  Sometimes toxic fumes sometimes get into your eye, too.  I've noticed that sometimes if there's a...  They have buildings with gas in them or something.  That could make your eye irritated.  You could wear an iPad if you want. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Hey, where's Martini Steve?  Martini Steve.  I've got to talk to him really fast.  Martini Steve.  I'm going to set him up so bad.  Let's see.  Oh, we've got to talk about why the show cut off at 10 yesterday as well.  Holy jeez.  I was listening to the replay yesterday, and all of a sudden Joe Rogan, we're having a  great time with him on the phone, and I listen to it.  Being here is one thing, but when you're listening to it on the air and it just cuts off, I started  laughing.  I go, oh boy, we just pissed off a whole other group of people. 
[00:11:30]  Oh man.  Like the morning people that heard it live, pissed off.  And now you get the replay people, and I was listening along, I knew how this was going  to end, and I'm like, right when it happened, I'm like, oh, there's a whole new batch pissed  off.  And then you get the night people.  Night people pissed off.  And I go to the instant feedback at home, and you just see, what the fuck, you guys stink.  What the hell, I'm like.  We're all in the same boat, though, because what happens is the phone cuts out here in  the studio, so we don't even know the end of the story.  Everything cuts out.  All we know is some crazy drug story with Doug Stanhope that he was telling. 
[00:12:00]  What was it, DMT, or some kind of psychedelic that they were taking.  Like the most powerful psychedelic ever.  He said it's like mushrooms, I don't know, times a million or something like that.  And Joe's setting up the story.  And it was going well, man.  Building to a crescendo.  And then all of a sudden, the show ended.  And then we want to know the end of the story, because screw you guys, you know.  As long as we find the end of the story, we can go home and live our lives.  Right.  And all of a sudden, the phone crapped out, too. 
[00:12:30]  I guess everything just turns off right at 10 o'clock.  At 10 o'clock, this place just completely shuts down.  The signal that's going out from us and the microphones, the computers, the telephone,  the telephone computers, we couldn't even call him back.  Right.  And pick it up.  We had to go to another office.  So maybe sometimes he's up.  Yeah.  He's in L.A.  If he's up, maybe he'll call and finish the story for everybody.  It's like a cliffhanger.  But a lot of people are very pissed off that the show just dumped out at 10. 
[00:13:00]  Matt from PA, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Hey.  That's what I was calling about.  It was the best interview you guys had since you guys come back on.  And we missed the end of it.  Now, that isn't saying much, by the way.  It was a very good interview.  But, you know, we've got to look at our past performance of phone interviews.  They've really stunk.  Yeah, definitely.  You know, I mean, it sucks, man.  I mean, these guys work for NASA, and they can't figure this stuff out.  Well, they figured it out. 
[00:13:30]  It's working exactly like they wanted it to.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Like, these geeks that run XM Satellite Radio, they don't really understand programming.  Uh-huh.  So they think, logically, it makes sense to just turn off everything right at 10 o'clock.  Right.  But if you do a radio show like ours, you know, every once in a while, we're going to need the leeway to go late.  We're just going to have, we just need that.  But here's the problem.  Let's say we went an extra five minutes with Rogan to finish up the call.  And it wouldn't, now, the people that listen to the end of the show, they wouldn't be pissed off, right? 
[00:14:00]  Where's that five minutes coming from?  The beginning of the next replay?  So now you're going to get the replay people pissed off that they missed five minutes at the beginning of the show.  So you're never going to make anyone happy.  There's only so many, there's 24 hours in that day.  You can't squeeze 24 hours, five minutes into it.  So there's really no way to go long without sacrificing somewhere else.  I don't know about that.  I mean, these geeks are very smart.  These eggheads are very smart.  They can figure out something that makes more sense.  Can we pass the show so we talk like this for a few minutes? 
[00:14:30]  Make everything go faster?  How about this?  Yeah.  At least allow us to continue the conversation with Joe Rogan.  And then figure it out later.  And then at least we have the end of the story.  And then the next day we could just, you know, start where we left off.  Oh, I like that.  Okay.  So there's got to be a way where, you know, okay, the show ended.  But we just continue talking.  Instead of shutting everything down.  We could have got another 10 minutes out of Joe Rogan and then we could have played that today.  Oh, this is what you missed yesterday.  Here it is.  Bam.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:15:00]  Matter of fact, that's something we've got to talk to the guys about.  Definitely.  There's got to be a way where we can continue the show at 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  Taping us doing what we do.  Uncomfortable moments.  Uncomfortable moments.  Where's Eric?  Where did Eric go?  Is it in the other room?  Eric!  Uh-oh.  You're not going to hang.  What?  You're not going to hang this on him, are you?  Eric!  You're hanging on Steve?  Oh, yeah, of course. 
[00:15:30]  Nothing.  Nothing.  We've got the whole gang in here.  It's Anthony, myself.  We've got Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  We've got Hurricane Ben.  It's Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  And we've got Eric.  Ben's song.  Sex Bagel. 
[00:16:00]  He doesn't have a song.  Also known as the Hawk who's got his sunglasses on.  He's looking down.  His eye is basically bleeding and leaking and pussing.  He's a mess.  He's like an old poodle.  He's a mess.  His eye is like an old poodle's eye at grandma's house.  He's just leaky.  He's a young go-getter.  Mm-hmm.  Works really hard on the show.  Does a great job, Anthony.  Oh, he dropped my banana.  Great job.  The new intern just dropped your banana.  The new intern dropped my banana.  Good job, Travis.  Banana diva.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:16:30]  Should I wash it for you?  No, that's okay.  It's got a peel on it.  You can never drop fruit, though, because then it gets just all mushy where it hits the floor.  Yeah, but bananas are okay.  They come with their own covering.  I don't know about that.  Well, so, um...  Oh, boy.  So, Steve brought up an observation this morning.  Not yet.  Not yet.  What?  He's working on something?  Yeah, I'm working on something.  Oh, you're working on something?  Yeah, yeah.  How long will that take?  I was hoping it'd be done by now, but...  What are you working on?  I think I know.  Somebody went out? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Someone went out?  Yeah.  Oh, very mysterious.  Make things easier.  It's very mysterious around here, Anthony.  Someone went out to make things easier.  You know?  Easier on everyone else?  Yeah, they went out for purchase, I think.  Oh, all right.  All right.  I don't know what's going on.  You don't?  No, this guy's got something going on behind the scenes.  Liar.  Liar.  Liar.  Doug out, Doug.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning, guys.  Hey, it's not like we all don't understand that you guys are getting Major League Baseball  in the spring, so you cut out a couple of those commercials and the replays. 
[00:17:30]  There's your five minutes.  I was thinking of that.  If we did go long on the next replay, how about cutting out some of the crap that they  run between our segments?  But I think with all the computer stuff, they just have to run it as it is.  Yeah, this is...  The geeks can figure it out.  No, the geeks can...  I mean, these guys are just flat-out brainiacs.  They can figure out a better system.  See, they've never really had, like, I don't know, a show with personalities. 
[00:18:00]  Personality.  That do things different.  It's not just...  This isn't like a music channel where it just doesn't matter.  You know what I mean?  And you can just keep resetting a computer or something.  Right.  It's a talk show where, you know, what if some unbelievable guest walks through here  at 945?  Yeah, then what?  We tell them.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  We could do eight to ten minutes with you, and then you've got to get out of here?  Yeah.  So at the worst, we've got to have a system where we can continue recording the program  after it cuts off the air.  Right.  Well, we own your show.  I'm punching out.  All right, buddy. 
[00:18:30]  Yesterday made that painfully obvious.  Sometimes the show ends at 10 o'clock with somebody on the phone doing a, what did we  learn, or something stupid that just doesn't matter.  But yesterday, that was, Joe Rogan was telling what sounded like an unbelievable story, which  we still don't know the ending of, and it just cut out.  Just cut out.  I got hundreds of email overnight.  Hundreds.  People were pissed.  Completely pissed off.  Yeah, there's a probe heading towards one of Saturn's moons, as we speak, landing on 
[00:19:00]  it, sending back pictures and stuff.  I think the geeks can figure out how to keep this studio running after 10 o'clock.  Oh, yeah.  I think they could work that out.  Oh, definitely.  Jason in New Hampshire, what's up?  You know, the show got cut off yesterday, but hoo-hoo, Robin, I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  I just don't care.  I don't care. 
[00:19:30]  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  All right, there.  That's enough of that.  So, a bunch of things going on today.  Prince Charles is ordered to, Prince Charles orders Harry to go to Auschwitz.  Auschwitz.  Is this getting a little out of control now?  A little out of control.  I mean, we were telling the story yesterday.  Harry there went to some kind of costume party.  It was pretty much a Halloween party.  Yeah.  Pretty much, even though it's not Halloween, obviously. 
[00:20:00]  Some English Halloween, I guess.  We've all been to Halloween parties.  I mean, the costumes get just very outrageous.  They stink.  I hate costume parties.  Ugh.  Dude, there's pictures of you dressing up for Halloween all over the internet.  Yeah, but I do it like as a goof.  Well, we did that BCN thing.  That's about it.  It's about the only time I've dressed up for a Halloween party.  The BCN thing.  Oh, you're dressed up for that?  Yeah, remember?  I dressed like a pirate or something?  I think I was some Renaissance guy. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, you were a Renaissance pig.  Like I was Renaissance man.  Right.  Yeah, I had a sword and everything.  Well, there's a picture of you at the Hard Rock Cafe also dressed up as a pirate or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Some kind of...  So, that's two, Anthony.  Again, I have used my sword.  How many more costumes have you worn on Halloween?  Let me think.  I think I went to a costume party.  Yeah, I've probably gone to a few more than I would like to acknowledge.  Yeah, okay.  So, you know, he used bad judgment, obviously.  Prince Harry.  And he decided to dress up as a Nazi soldier. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  He's dressed as a soldier.  I've seen a lot worse at Halloween parties.  A lot worse.  And now they're making a huge deal about it.  A huge deal.  We've been to costume parties where people are dressed as Osama Bin Laden.  That's like a big costume around...  In New York City, that was one of the hot ones the last couple of years.  Yeah.  Which is insane.  Put the rag on your head.  You put on the big beard.  And you're Osama Bin Laden.  You're going around.  Hi, I'm the guy that killed a bunch of your people. 
[00:21:30]  You know, not six million, but...  Yeah, it was kind of a sensitive subject.  You know, but no one really gets blown out of proportion.  And then Harry puts a swastik on his arm.  Pretty bad taste.  It's bad taste, bad judgment, but I don't think it means that he's supporting...  No, I don't think it means...  Nazi-ism or whatever you want to call it.  They're calling him like Harry the Nazi and...  What was the headline in, I guess, the post?  Yeah, where's the post?  I read it to Anthony and we were laughing. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, Raging Charles orders Nazi Harry to tour Auschwitz.  Nazi Harry.  It's not like he's really a Nazi.  He's not going to white supremacist meetings and...  Give me the Daily News, please.  Because there's these...  I mean, they're all calling him a Nazi now just because he wore the Nazi uniform at a party.  Yeah.  Bad taste, bad judgment, probably, just because he's, you know, the prince.  But it's a stupid costume.  And Prince Charles has now ordered him to take a private tour of Auschwitz. 
[00:22:30]  Why would...  And they also told him to go see Schindler's List.  Did he really?  Yeah.  So he understands...  I'm going to go see Spielberg's movie Schindler's List.  So he understands the sensitivity of...  Yeah.  Of this.  I haven't seen Schindler's List, by the way.  Can you believe that?  Really?  I've never seen it.  It's a great movie.  I got to rent it.  It really is a great movie.  Very sad.  That's what I hear.  Very sad.  I don't like those depressing movies, though, sometimes.  Does it end happy?  No.  Does some people get out?  Some people get out, right? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I guess.  They're on the list, right?  It's Schindler's List.  Is that what the movie's about?  And people get out?  Okay.  So it's happy.  Right.  Well, that's the...  But that's the big story in New York today, that he's going to go to Auschwitz for a tour.  That's the front page.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do they do?  They do tours over there?  Yeah.  Do they do tours?  What do you mean, Urk?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've been on it.  You've been on the Auschwitz tour?  You've been on the Auschwitz tour?  Where is that?  Poland?  It's creepy.  You went? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  How the hell?  Why did...  When, where, why, how?  99.  1999.  Mm-hmm.  You go...  We were doing a whole bus tour through Europe, and we got there, and it's really eerie,  because there's a smell that you can't define still that lingers up to that place.  No, I think we can define the smell.  I think it's easy to figure that out.  You just walk through.  It's very quiet.  Yeah.  It's very dank, and you just walk through, and you just get chills as soon as you walk 
[00:24:00]  through those main gates with the bus and everything else, and they're just walking.  They don't take you to everything.  They just show you a few little things, but...  Not a souvenir stand or anything, right?  No.  Because I figured with a tour, it would be, you know, like, we're used to tours.  Like, you hop in a little car that drives you around like a people mover.  Mm-hmm.  Nothing like that?  No.  They've got these signs posted in different areas explaining what was at this particular  section.  Like, say, a building has been condemned, or they took it down for some reason, that this 
[00:24:30]  was the holding pen.  This was where they would eat.  This was the guards' bathrooms.  This is the actual chamber.  And very creepy.  Hmm.  I can't believe he went.  I know.  I thought he was just talking out of his ass.  No, there's a lot of people who go on those tours.  Did it make you, I don't know, change your opinions or feelings about anything?  Did it affect you?  Change?  I don't know.  Change your opinions?  Not like he's going from...  Are you insane?  Not like he's going from one extreme to the other.  I'm not saying like he's a Jew-hating anti-Semite. 
[00:25:00]  You could have chose your words a little better.  Did it change him?  It made it sound like, ah, like beforehand, it was like, ah, that whole thing was overrated.  No, that's what I mean.  I'm not talking going from one extreme to the other.  I'm talking about like change you in a way that you now have a different outlook on this  or different...  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you go...  I don't know what it is, but when you walk through, you know what's happened already before  you see everything, and the hair just stands on end. 
[00:25:30]  And it wasn't just me.  A lot of other people were feeling it, too.  I would say pretty much everybody.  You walk out of there, how can you not?  I mean, not the...  I'm not like anti-Jewish or anything, but I walked in there, and you come back out, and  it's like, oh, my God.  Now you fully understand just from hearing, because it was, you know, way over there and  before my time, but now you got a real appreciation of it from seeing what they did.  An appreciation...  You appreciate what the Nazis did?  Not what they did, no. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, my God.  That's outrageous.  Outrageous what?  You're outrageous.  You're a shock jock.  You have an appreciation for what they did?  That's awful.  Not for what they did.  For what has happened.  Right.  An understanding.  You appreciate what happened.  Never mind.  I can't wait.  No?  And they say I mispronounced.  Oh, my God.  I don't think the word appreciation should be anywhere near your experience.  He appreciates what happened there. 
[00:26:30]  He's very appreciative of what happened at Auschwitz.  That's pretty much what I heard.  That's what I'm taking away from this.  He has an appreciation.  All right.  Well...  Want to try to explain yourself a little better?  Yeah.  Okay.  Bad choice of words.  All right.  All right.  Let's try again.  A better...  Take the Nazi armband off while you're talking about this, too.  A better understanding of what has happened.  A better understanding of what has happened.  Okay.  That's a little better, I think.  All right. 
[00:27:00]  You understand what happened there at Auschwitz.  Okay.  Why would you understand?  Okay.  All right.  No, that's good.  So you think Harry will get a better appreciation for what happened there if he goes visit?  He'll understand.  Understand.  Maybe be a little more sensitive.  Has it made you a little more sensitive to Jewish people? 
[00:27:30]  Not that I wasn't before.  All right.  What do you have against the Jewish people?  Nothing.  You live in Brooklyn.  There's a lot of Jewish people that live in Brooklyn.  I have no problems with them.  A lot of Hasidic live there?  I actually haven't seen those yet.  Did you maybe wave one through traffic where you would have maybe cut them off and flipped  them the bird?  But then do you think back to your appreciation for Auschwitz and all that happened there?  And then, you know, you just let them in, maybe. 
[00:28:00]  No?  No.  All right.  No.  I'm just trying to get a feel for it.  Eric has an appreciation for Auschwitz.  You have to pardon my ignorance.  That's what I learned today.  Pardon my ignorance.  I haven't been there.  I didn't stand on that ground, look around, and get that deep appreciation for it.  Hopefully, we can go on a field trip and appreciate just as well as you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And have an understanding.  You know, the most I can even think of.  Of what they did.  The closest thing I can think of is going down to the ground zero. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  Right here in Manhattan.  World Trade Center.  You know, and look at that site and go, wow, you know, I really appreciate what happened  here.  You know, you could picture doing that.  Get a true appreciation.  Let's go to Brett.  Hey, Brett.  What's up?  Brett?  Yeah.  Hello.  That's you.  Let's go.  Is Eric still there? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Eric, you need to get off that shit.  I mean, think about everything else that's happened in the world.  Think about what happened to the Cherokees in Georgia.  Do you see any fucking Cherokee burial memorial that you can drive through in the United States?  Uh-oh.  I think this guy's kind of downplaying the Holocaust.  It shit happens everywhere.  It happens all the fuck over the place.  It's ridiculous.  I don't know.  Well, that was kind of a pretty gruesome example of genocide, my friend. 
[00:29:30]  He hung up?  Yeah, we're done with him.  Boy in Jersey.  What's up, boy?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Long time, long time.  Anyway, I lived 100 miles away from Auschwitz.  You want to talk about traumatizing a fucking 11-year-old kid when they took us on a field trip there?  It was un-fucking-believable.  That's it, huh?  Well, no, no, not, well, you know, I thought you were going to ask a question or something, you know, whatever. 
[00:30:00]  I don't know.  Whatever I was saying about the place was truly unbelievable.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  His phone's a little hard to understand.  I was out of that one.  Jim in Brooklyn, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Now, let me see if I got this straight.  From what Eric just said, he understands why the Nazis did this.  That's what he got at it at all.  He said you understand.  You have an understanding.  Yeah.  What do you mean by you have an understanding?  I'm not going to win.  Anyway.  You might. 
[00:30:30]  No matter how I try to phrase this, it's going to come out wrong.  You might if you choose your words wisely.  I think what he meant is he doesn't agree what the Nazis did, but he understands.  Have a good day, guys.  You have an understanding of what goes on.  So, you wouldn't have handled the situation the same way the Nazis did, but you understand.  That is not what I'm saying at all.  That is it?  Okay.  I'm confused again.  All right.  When you grow up and you read about it and you learn about it and you see the movie and 
[00:31:00]  everything, okay, that's fine.  But when you're actually at the site where everything has happened, it's very overcoming.  You sit there and you're just like, oh my God, this is the actual place.  It seems more real actually being there than compared to having learned about it and seen  the movie.  So, you went many years thinking it wasn't real.  No.  I knew it was real.  Oh.  All right.  Again, I misheard because it sounded like, you know, you were kind of like, ah, that didn't 
[00:31:30]  really happen, the Holocaust.  And then once you go to Auschwitz, then you understand what the Nazis did and appreciate  it.  And you saw the movie.  Is there an official movie?  Shouldn't lose the list.  The movie.  The movie.  The official movie of Auschwitz.  All right.  All right.  I think I understand now.  We're going to take a very quick break, Anthony, and we're going to continue.  Yes, we are.  Steve wants to bring up something.  Why is it me?  Steve wants to bring up something. 
[00:32:00]  I didn't.  You were the one telling everybody.  I didn't introduce this.  You were the one telling everybody.  Did you get your package?  Yeah, I did.  All right.  We'll get into that next.  But first, it's Linkin Park and Jay-Z getting together.  A little mashup called 99 Problems.  History in the making.  Woo!  If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son.  I got 99 pounds, but a bitch ain't one.  I got the Rap Patrol on the Gap Patrol. 
[00:32:30]  Foes that want to make sure my cast is closed.  Rap critics say he's money cash hoes.  I'm from the hood, stupid.  What type of facts are those?  If you grew up with hoes and you zap the toes, you celebrate the minute you was having dope.  I'm like, fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole.  If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.  I got beef with radio if I don't play they show.  They don't play my hits, but I don't give a shit.  So, Rap Max, try and use my black ass.  Don't advertise me, give them more cash for ass fuckers. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know what you take me as.  Don't understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has.  I'm from rags to riches, mingles.  I ain't dumb.  I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one.  Hit me.  Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe.  Sometimes I need you to stay away from me.  Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know.  Somehow I need you to go. 
[00:33:30]  Forget our memories.  Forget our possibilities.  If you have a girl, pal, I'll go back with you, son.  I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one.  Hit me.  Forget our memories.  Forget our possibilities.  If you have a girl, pal, I'll go back with you, son.  I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one.  Hit me.  Yeah, it's 94 and my trunk is raw. 
[00:34:00]  In my rearview mirror, it's the motherfucking law.  I got two choices, y'all pull over the car or bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor.  Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake.  Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case.  So I pull over to the side of the road.  I heard.  Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?  Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low.  Do I look like a mind reader, sir?  I don't know.  Am I under arrest or should I guess the most?  Well, you was doing 55 and 54.  Uh-huh. 
[00:34:30]  Launching the registration, they step out of the car.  Are you carrying a weapon on you?  I know a lot of you are.  I ain't stepping out of shit.  All my papers legit.  Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?  Well, my glove compartment is locked, so it's trucking back.  And I know my rights, so you gonna need a warrant for that.  Aren't you sharp attack?  You some type of law or something?  Somebody important or something?  I ain't passed the ball, but I know I'm no fit enough that you want to legally search my shit.  And we'll see how smart you are when the canine comes.  I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one. 
[00:35:00]  Hit me.  Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know.  Somehow I need to be alone.  Don't forget our memories.  Forget our possibilities.  If you having girls, I don't have to bat for you, son.  I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one.  Hit me.  Don't forget our memories.  Forget our possibilities. 
[00:35:30]  If you having girls, I don't have to bat for you, son.  I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one.  Hit me.  Young.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  I'm Adrian.  One last time, nigga, make some noise.  I don't need you anymore.  I don't want to be ignored.  I don't need one more day.  If you're wasting me away, I don't need you anymore.  I don't want to be ignored. 
[00:36:00]  I don't need one more day.  If you're wasting me away,  you are wasting me away,  and you are wasting me away.  Forget our memories.  Forget our possibilities.  If you have a girl problem,  I'll go back with you, son.  I got 99 problems,  but a bitch ain't one.  Forget our memories.  Forget our possibilities.  If you have a girl problem,  I'll go back with you, son.  I got 99 problems, 
[00:36:30]  but a bitch ain't one.  Vision spending!  In a starchy world  Mired in imperfection  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel  But for some reason at this place  They put it like on the grill  One man  It's all about me, me, me  You challenge the status quo  They don't have a toaster? 
[00:37:00]  That annoys me  Navigating treacherous terrain  There's crap all over it  Like I'm seeing grease  Confronting the unknown  And there's something green on it  Which could be a pepper or a booger  It's awful  The platoon of interns  You sheep  And military precision  Go, go, go  Fix it  The world will witness  A revolution  Bagel diva  Coming soon  Come on  To a bakery near you  Are you kidding?

[00:40:30]  Ad nauseum  Uh huh  And now you know  There's things we just  Don't feel like explaining  But I gotta tell you this  Everything does get  Wrapped up nicely  The longer you listen  You know things make sense  And the decoder ring  If you will  Is actually websites  You could go to  Foundrymusic.com  Or any of the number of  Message boards  Whackbag.com  OpieAnthony.net  Yeah  And get an answer  To any question about this show  What things mean 
[00:41:00]  You know  What these slang terms mean  Little inside jokes  It's all available out there  Alright bro  Great to hear you back on  Alright thanks bro  This show is a big puzzle  You think it's a big puzzle?  It's a big puzzle sometimes  And you gotta search out  The pieces elsewhere  Yeah  Sometimes all the pieces  Aren't available on this show itself  You gotta go to the internet  We're like a  We're like a  School project  You have to do your research  In order to completely  Understand it  And get a good grade  Yeah it's very true 
[00:41:30]  Very true  Alright Martini Steve  Heading back into the studio  Yeah  It's Martini Steve  Certainly is  Martini Steve  He's on fire  It's Martini Steve  We're all very distracted  Because we got here  Like we do  Around 5am  And we're show prepping  And looking at audio  And well  Listening to audio  And looking at the pictures  And going through the newspapers  And just trying to get  The whole show together  And Steve  You know  Started  You know  Started talking about  A member of the show 
[00:42:00]  To everybody  Yeah I know  He's got a big mouth  Yeah  Yeah because that's  That's my thing  I'm the gossipy  Big mouth one  I'm not a gossipy guy  No not at all  Ben's the gossip guy  Well no okay  Bad reference  Because Ben actually  Ben didn't do anything  But I just agreed  With something  All of a sudden  This is my problem  This is pretty much  What amounts to  An intervention  Yeah  This is pretty much  It's like an intervention  This is pretty much  What's called  An uncomfortable situation 
[00:42:30]  Right  Probably have them  Around the workplace  All the time  Sure  I mean I'm sure  There are people out there  That have this type of problem  Around the workplace  Constantly  And don't know  What to do about it  And if you've ever read  Ann Landers  Or those advice people  That sometimes  They get written in  With problems like this  And they say  Look  You're doing  The person a favor  Just confront them  With it  Right  Alright  You think that's  A good way to go  I guess  It's kind of an intervention 
[00:43:00]  It's going to be  Very uncomfortable  So we might as well  Bring the whole staff  In here to make it  Even more uncomfortable  I personally  Hadn't noticed  Well it only  Opie said  He had noticed  For a while  A long time  A long time  Steve concurred  I agreed  Wholeheartedly  I agreed  Well it's just  When you're working  In close quarters  With people  You notice  You know  Certain quirks  And certain habits  And you know  After a while  Something bubbles  To the surface  And you know  Fans out across the room  And you have to  You have to address it 
[00:43:30]  Does anyone have a clue  As to what this might be about  Anyone  Without saying it  Anyone  Who wants to read  Show of hands  Show of hands  He knows  He knows  He knows  Eric show of hands  Do you know what this is about  At all  No  Ben do you know  Ben knows  I know  Wait everyone  Raise their hand  That knows  Alright  Steve  One  Ben  Nathaniel  The intern  Derek  The new young  Go-getter  Has no clue  It's only a second day 
[00:44:00]  Danny has no idea  Danny  So  So then  Obviously  It's either  Danny or Eric  Why  Because  They're the only ones  They're the only ones  Not raising their hands  Uh huh  Anyway  Alright  So  Holy shit  This is really uncomfortable  He's gonna lunge across here  With a knife  This is really uncomfortable  Basically  You know  Steve  This was your thing  Horse  Shit  Come on 
[00:44:30]  57th is right downstairs  Take Steve out  Plenty of buses drive by  Exactly  You can just launch him  Under a wheel  Exactly  Why do it figuratively  When you can do it literally  Exactly  This was Steve's thing  So Steve  Um  What's that  You have a bag in front of you  I got a bag in front of me  Basically  There's something in there  Now if you pulled  If you pulled out  The contents of that bag  Wouldn't  Everybody  Now  Be on  What this is probably about  Alarmingly obvious  Alarmingly obvious 
[00:45:00]  Basically  You know  We all run around  And shout ideas  To each other  You know  And you know  You're  Especially when you come in  In the morning  You know  Sometimes you haven't had time  To prepare adequately  Sometimes you haven't  You know  If you wake up late  You might not get a shower  You know  Sometimes you forget  To really hide  I came in once  Without a shower  Sure  It happens  It happens  Every once in a while  Oh you shower at night  Of course  Yeah  But sometimes  It's a little bit more chronic  If you will  Um  And in this case  It's with Eric  Um  So  Look at that  Eric  Look at him  He just freaked out 
[00:45:30]  He rolled backwards  In his chair  Looked up  And went  What  This is about me  Like he can't believe  It's about him  Hold on  He insisted  It was about Danny  Eric  You thought it was Danny  I didn't know  Get on mic Eric  I have no idea  What it was  Eric's having  A tough morning  He's pretty much  Admitted  He appreciates the Nazis  And now  This is going to get  A lot worse  Do you notice Danny  See Danny  We faked this all out  By bringing Danny  In at first  He thought it was about him  Danny  No you're safe  I couldn't imagine  What it could possibly be  I was shitting myself  What was going on 
[00:46:00]  It's about your shitting yourself  Problem Danny  What was going on in your head  I was like  I was just trying to think  Of anything  That I might have done wrong  And I was like  I thought I've been behaving  Having sex with Lacey  In my bedroom  That's what it was Danny  Holy crap  Sit down Danny  Eric so it's to you now  Uh oh  And there's about  Eight people in the studio  Looking on  He's  He's  He's  He's  You have any  Eric you have any idea  It's not your leaky eye  No  That's pussy  It's not leaky eye  No you can't help that 
[00:46:30]  That happens  Eric any idea  No  No idea  No  Come on  Play along  What do you think  If you had a guess  Something that people  You're walking over to somebody  And  Steve's not the only one  When he brought it to my attention  I was like  Jesus  I was like  You know  Now that I think about it  You're right  Like you know  Eric will walk up to either  Ben or I  And we're typing stuff in  On the prep sheet  And he'll go  And he'll have like 
[00:47:00]  A stack of papers  Oh don't forget to add this  Or don't forget to add  This piece of information  And all of a sudden  You get the  Inviting waft of  Staten Island  In your face  Oh boy  Oh look at him  Oh no I can't look  I can't look  And so  Oh is this uncomfortable  As a humane gesture  I sent Nathaniel  Holy Jesus  Down to Dwayne Reed  To pick up some  You know  A few common items  That we can have here  In house  So just in case  Eric's rushing 
[00:47:30]  Oh no look  Oh I just threw the mic  Oh he just tossed the mic  It's so uncomfortable  Just in case  Eric's in a hurry  Because I know  He's got a long commute  In the morning  You know  I've got to defend Eric  Steve I think this is brutal  That you would do this  In front of everybody  Jesus  Like it's my idea  I do want to defend Eric  The guy probably  You know  Puts in about  16 hours  For this radio show  Every day  Exactly  Maybe he just  Doesn't have time  Well now he can  Because as of right now 
[00:48:00]  He will now  Have his own  What do you got  Oh  His own  Tartar controlled  Toothpaste  You got some Colgate  His own toothbrush  It's a toothbrush  What are the bristles  On that  Is it medium  Soft  This is awful  Gem head  Soft  Soft  A little soft  Soft  So he doesn't  All the way up  Hurt his gums  He's got some  Some scope  Oh scope  And so that  He doesn't get any  Build up in between  The teeth  Which often can  Cause halitosis 
[00:48:30]  You get some  Some reach  Some waxed  Dental floss  Dental floss  So  This can now be  Kept here  Eric  Here you want  To hand that to him  Alright  The whole time  His head is now  In his hands  His head is in his hands  He's kind of  Hitting the counter  And he's turning right  Tapping with the other hand  A little red  His face now matches  His kind of red  Shirt that he's wearing  Hat brim pulled down  So you can barely see  The sunglasses  Covering his leaky eye  And a very unhappy 
[00:49:00]  Look on his face  Yeah  I  You know  That was considerate  Oh in front of  Huge amounts of people  Yeah Steve  You know  You're a real swell guy  In front of the whole nation  Yeah  As we said before  I'm sure this happens  Though in  Workplaces  All around the country  And it is best  To just step up  I guess  And you know  Take care of it  Hey  Sometimes you walk in  And your  Tucked in shirt  Is a little bit  Uncomfortable for people 
[00:49:30]  So you have to learn  To untuck your shirt  Untuck your shirt  Untuck your shirt  Yeah  Eric Logan's got to  Learn how to  Untuck his shirt  Oh yeah  Really  When he came down  To the blackjack table  In Vegas  I was like  What are you doing  Untuck that shirt  Tucking  But Eric  You came in  You ran in  And you were  Placing all the CDs  Down on the latest  Audio for today's show  What is this  Brush your  Brush your  Brush your  Brush your  Brush your  Your teeth  Top and back  Front and bottom  In between  Brush your  Brush your  Brush your  Brush your  Front of your teeth 
[00:50:00]  Top and back  Front and bottom  In between  Now brush  Your teeth  Brush  Your teeth  Yeah  Woo  My God  Come on 
[00:50:30]  Brush  Oh  Oh  Woo  Brush your  Brush your  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  All right.  Very good pickup. 
[00:51:00]  I think that was Derek, huh?  Danny and Derek came up with that?  Very nice, guys.  Maestros.  So, yeah, while you were getting the studio ready,  you know, Anthony kind of looked over to me and noticed, too.  I didn't say anything.  I want to make it clear.  I didn't say a word until somebody else said something to me.  But you agreed wholeheartedly.  Yeah, I agreed with you, of course.  Yeah.  Oh, well, the instant feedbacks are just pouring in. 
[00:51:30]  Uh-oh.  Anal sex breath bagel.  Hawkitosis.  Perhaps the new name, um, garlic sex bagel.  Why did everyone leave the studio?  Club stinky breath?  Is it that uncomfortable here?  Yeah, I think it was that tense in here that everybody had to clear out.  He's not really looking up yet.  No, he's pretty pissed off. 
[00:52:00]  No.  Eric, do you have anything to say?  Just tapping his pen like a lunatic.  Wow.  You all right, Eric?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Oh, no, he's not.  No, he's not.  No, he's not.  I heard some shake in that voice.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  No.  There's no crying in radio.  Wow, is he angry?  There's no crying in radio.  I appreciate it.  I really do.  It's looking down.  No, you just keep it here.  Picking up your... 
[00:52:30]  Eric, it's called being in the barrel.  This is probably the first time you've ever been in the...  No, this isn't the first time.  When was the last time?  Let's see.  There was the fire alarm incident.  Oh.  No, that was like real life.  We were really pissed off.  That had nothing to do with being in the barrel.  We moved on from that.  I mean, you've been just kicking ass ever since.  Then I guess, yes.  Sorry, I'm stuck in my head.  No, this is the first time.  Okay, so, you know, suggestion.  Noted.  Dude, no big deal.  You know, people think you have bad breath.  People think I'm gay because of the Javalog thing. 
[00:53:00]  Trust me, it could be worse.  I don't think people really think you're gay.  Good.  Thank you, Anthony.  I really...  Thanks for sticking up for me.  Thanks, though.  You all right, Eric?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Any thoughts?  Thoughts and prayers?  Are you going to go give it a test run in the bathroom?  Sure, if you want me to.  I don't want anyone to do anything.  I, you know.  I don't want anyone to do anything. 
[00:53:30]  I just thought, you know, if he wants to, then he could go into the bathroom.  Oh, my God.  Eric, pick up your toothbrush, your toothpaste, the mouthwash, and the dental floss, and just...  Your eye drops.  Your eye drops for your leaky eye.  And just walk away. 
[00:54:00]  Just hit the old bathroom.  Hit the old bathroom.  60 degrees in New York today.  I hope Ben opened up the window.  There he goes.  He's heading for the door.  With his head down.  Head down, walking out.  With his hand full of dental hygiene products.  I'm sure.  Is he, is he?  Give a peek, Ben.  See if he's out in the bathroom.  Is he gone?  Yeah, I think he's gone. 
[00:54:30]  Jesus Christ.  That was the most uncomfortable moment.  It had to be done.  It had to be done.  I'm not going to lie to you today.  I've known us for a while, and today...  You did?  Yeah, today I got nauseous.  He didn't work...  He doesn't really work near me in any capacity.  And that's why you come over.  But, you know, I'm pretty alone over here in the corner.  But he's constantly over by Opie, giving him, like, CDs and paperwork and stuff.  And then Steve, he's constantly working with Steve.  In all fairness, what it comes down to is that, you know, he wakes up and just comes right to work. 
[00:55:00]  Exactly.  I guess he just runs in.  You know, like, you shower the night before, because you don't have a lot of time to get yourself  together.  And it's not like I'm, you know, sleeping so many hours.  Yeah, and I'm not going to wake up and then shower.  We've all had bad breath at one time or another, but it's becoming a regular thing.  It's very chronic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nathaniel, of course, because...  Oh, from the bathroom?  Yeah, because we're all dicks when it comes down to it.  That's why everyone works here.  Nathaniel ran with a telephone and followed young Eric into the bathroom. 
[00:55:30]  Nathaniel.  Yeah.  What's going on in there?  I'm looking at a man with a leaky eye giving me the finger.  We are just dicks.  We just rub it in and rub it in and rub it in.  Is he using the products?  Yeah, he seems to be familiar with their use.  Yeah, is he doing it properly?  Is he really getting the back teeth? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, he put the brushy end in first, so that's good.  All right.  This is very good.  Is he doing up and down in the front?  This is good.  He's focusing on the tongue.  Oh, the tongue is very important.  You should have got a tongue scraper for him, too.  Oh, yeah.  They have those little things that scrape the gap up in your tongue.  Yeah.  Remember, brush up and down.  How does that song go?  Yeah, let's hear that song again.  Let me hear the song, perhaps.  It'll help him out.  As Nathaniel reports from the bathroom as Eric brushes his teeth in front of the whole nation, 
[00:56:30]  Anthony.  By the way, Nathaniel is hosting Brother Joe's show tonight at the Hard Rock Cafe here in New York City.  Oh, yeah.  I had the paperwork somewhere.  Nathaniel, are you doing a little stand-up tonight?  Hopefully not.  Going to host at Hard Rock Cafe, world's best tribute bands, Monsters of Mock.  He just threw water at me.  He threw water at you?  Yeah.  Got a Livewire ACDC band and Kiss Nation, a Kiss tribute band at the New York City Hard Rock Cafe. 
[00:57:00]  Free admission.  10 p.m. start time.  It's over three hours of live music and our own Nathaniel at the Hard Rock Cafe tonight at 10 p.m.  Free admission.  All right.  Anything else going on in there, Nathaniel?  He's moved on to the scope.  Scope?  Wasn't that a little quick for the crush?  I'm thinking it might be a little quick.  Yeah, it wasn't the ADA prescribed two minutes.  No.  He's got a radio show to be a part of.  Nathaniel, tell him he's got to go for a second coat. 
[00:57:30]  Anthony is saying he must go for a second coat.  It's not quite long enough with the...  Uh-oh.  He's pissed.  What did he say, Nathaniel?  Um, I believe the direct quote is what the fuck.  All right.  Let him scope and then he can leave.  Can I back away now?  Yes, you can back away.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Nathaniel reporting live from the bathroom.  Dude, he is legitimately pissed off.  Oh, he is irate.  No one ever likes hearing that.  No.  Good for Steve for bringing this to our attention today. 
[00:58:00]  Oh.  Hang him out.  Jesus.  All I walk in here was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's pretty bad.  All right.  Your turn.  What?  You know what?  Maybe, maybe this came from me.  Maybe.  But you had a lot of enjoyment.  Yeah, yeah, I did.  I did.  You know what?  Getting an intern to run to Dwayne Reed.  Okay, yeah.  And you had no problem facing Eric and telling him.  No.  No, I really didn't.  You know, Eric is working his ass off and he constantly is bringing stuff, bringing in 
[00:58:30]  audio, bringing in news clips.  By ass, you don't mean mouth, right?  What'd I say?  Because you're working his ass off.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  You don't mean mouth.  No.  No, not at all.  But it's just after, you know, 57 times of this, you know, shit wagon scent hitting you in  the face, you just...  Oh, my God.  You just get like, all right, dude, go away.  Just leave me alone.  Wasn't that funny when he was talking about Auschwitz and said that this smells...  Yeah.  And we knew what we were going to talk about when he said it.  We all started laughing. 
[00:59:00]  I smelled like a whole Auschwitz mouth.  That was great to have everybody in here.  And then slowly but surely, he's realizing, uh-oh, it's either me or Danny.  Oh, isn't that the worst?  He's looking around like, that couldn't be me.  He's got his arms falling all confident, like, oh, I can't wait to tool on Danny.  I mean, yeah, that's the truth.  Yeah.  He might be pissed off because he was in the barrel, but he would have jumped right on  the pile and went after Danny if it was Danny.  Anthony, what's going on?  Morning, boys.  Morning, man.  Good for you, Steve.  Don't take no fucking crap from nobody. 
[00:59:30]  Stand up.  It's fucking inconsiderate.  Halitosis bagel floating around the whole fucking office.  That's horrible.  Yeah, and it's just like the fucking dirt bag who doesn't wipe their ass all the way.  They stink like shit the whole fucking thing.  Oh, cranky ass?  Yeah, crank swamp ass.  That is really nasty when someone's got cranky ass.  You know, we used to do a bit on our old show where we would break bad news to people.  Maybe we should do that today if someone has a really good one.  You know, someone who walks around like that is either inconsiderate or ignorant, and either  way, they've got to be fucking told and put in their bed. 
[01:00:00]  Good for dropping the bomb, Steve.  Good for you.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Punch it out.  Punch it out.  You know, we used to break bad news.  Remember that, Anthony?  Yeah, I think we did one with some guy who had a bad toupee on around the office, and  we called him up and told him, just knock it off.  You're not fooling anybody.  Bad breath's a good one.  Yeah, swamp ass.  Someone around your office is pissing you off because they're ruining everybody's little  work day with maybe hygiene or habits or something like that. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, we'd be willing to break the news to them.  What the hell?  We do it here on our own program.  Sure.  Dan in Warren.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, we had this retarded kid in high school.  He used to go out for sports and stuff, big shit stains in his pants, but he's sunk in  general, and his nickname was Enrique.  Enrique?  Oh, with the emphasis on reek in the middle of his name?  Yeah, his name was Eric, so we called him Enrique.  That's great.  Very nice.  All right.  Let's, Chuck from Montana, what's up? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, I've had bad breath.  It's the first kind of gas or reflux, no matter how much you brush.  Oh, his phone sucks, but he's saying it might be acid reflux.  All right.  Enough of that.  Poor Eric.  Now he's like kind of just keeping to himself in the office.  Feeling like a little outcast.  Yeah, a little bit.  I don't think he...  Thank God he wore his sunglasses today, Anthony.  Oh, I know.  He's not going to be able to look anyone in the eye.  Thank God for that leaky eye.  So, Jim Norton is at Zaney's in Chicago, the one in Vernon Hills, I think. 
[01:01:30]  Mm-hmm.  So, Norton's not here today, but we found a replacement.  Could you honestly call him a replacement?  I don't know.  He's filling in for Jim Norton today.  Filling the void, yes.  Filling the void.  We figured, I mean, Anthony and I could do the show without anyone else if we had to.  We've done it many years.  But, you know, this new format, it's a three-guy thing, and we figured, give some other people  a chance to get a lot of mic time when Norton, you know, from time to time, Norton's going 
[01:02:00]  to hit the road to do his comedy thing.  Scott Giggs, he's a working comic.  So, Rich Voss is filling in today.  Oh, listen, listen.  Yeah.  You hear that?  The country go, oh, man.  Oh, I could actually hear it through the windows.  Oh.  So, yeah, that's what's going to happen.  But, you know what?  We brought in Jim Norton's Yellow Discipline CD.  Nice.  Here, what do you want to hear?  You can have a little piece of Jimmy right here. 
[01:02:30]  What do you want to hear as we go to break?  I don't know.  Oh, there should be times on these, shouldn't there?  Well, they're all kind of short.  Are they?  Yeah.  What piques your interest out of those titles?  Well, just looking at the titles, Sex and Racism.  Sex and Racism?  What track is that?  That would be track nine.  Okay.  We could play a few of these throughout the day.  Yeah, we'll feature Jim Norton's CD today for him.  Yellow Discipline.  You can get it off eatabullet.com.  Because a Britney log looks like it could be funny.  Yeah, and he's playing Zanies and Vernon Hills in Chicago all this weekend. 
[01:03:00]  But here's Jim Norton.  You have to excuse me.  I'm getting over a cold.  I hope.  Nowadays, you sniffle.  You start going over your entire history.  Oh, the condom broke with her, and he was Haitian, and he was Haitian.  Plus, I think we have a lot less racism in our part of the country, because people are 
[01:03:30]  pretty used to each other.  We all get used to seeing each other's dumb faces on a daily basis.  None of us are shocked.  I think sex is the cure for racism, because people are the same when they're naked.  People react the same.  I've slept with white girls, black girls, Spanish girls.  There's no difference.  None of them enjoyed it.  Women of all races and creeds agree that I have the sex appeal of leukemia.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:04:00]  Feel the love.  It's an Opie and Anthony Wow Sticker Stop.  This Wednesday, January 19th, get to the Lynn Haven Mall parking lot outside Barnes & Noble  in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and pick up your Wow Stickers.  Those aren't real, yes they are.  Take the Virginia Beach Expressway to exit 19A, and the Lynn Haven Mall is one mile down 
[01:04:30]  on the right.  I'm getting an erection as we speak.  Once again, here's how it should sound.  The Wow Sticker Stop.  Brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report presented by Steamboat Colorado.  Come see why folks have coined Steamboat the land of the free, home of the brave, and playground  of the red-blooded powder hounds.  Visit Steamboat.com where they picked up a couple feet of snow over the past week.  It's powdery snow everywhere you go thanks to big snowstorms.  20 inches earlier this week at Squaw Valley, powder skiing on 100% of their terrain. 
[01:05:00]  Timberline, Oregon just got 6 inches of snow to 75% of their trails.  Sun Valley, Idaho is on 75-pack powder slopes.  The Seattle Ridge and the Bowls are open.  The Canyons in Utah on 138 trails.  They got two feet of snow this week, and a chilly weekend for Vail and Aspen where both  spots picked up a foot of snow over the past couple of days.  Snow making back in a big way at Snowshoe Mountain, West Virginia.  More than 50% of their terrain is open. 
[01:05:30]  And Sunday River in Maine, with 42 miles of skiing, will open the weekend on loose and  frozen granular on eight mountains.  I'm Chuck Devine with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  XM News, talk, sports, and information.  It's everything, all the time.  XM 202.  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Calling all freaks.  Oh, you fuckers are funny, man. 
[01:06:00]  I gotta go right to the phone.  Gotta say hi to Dave on Long Island.  Dave, go ahead.  Yeah, I was just wondering if Steve was gonna hit Ben with some hair products on Monday.  And then they can go and freshen up in the bathroom together.  Keep the nest down, yeah.  That's gonna be Steve's next project to get gel for Ben.  A little firework.  A little moose.  Very good, Dave.  Thank you. 
[01:06:30]  And real fast, we gotta go to Kay.  Is this a girl?  Hey.  Is this a girl?  Kay?  Carrie.  Carrie?  Yes.  Are you a girl?  Yes, I'm a girl.  We love girls!  I'm a trucker girl.  Awesome.  We want more women to call this damn program.  What, the women can't afford XM or something?  We had a lot of women listening to us when we were on commercial radio.  Come on, girls.  We love girls.  I'm even better because I'm a trucker girl. 
[01:07:00]  All right, cool.  So what do you got today?  I just have to say that I once quit a job because I worked with somebody.  The manager just had this frank, frank awful, but I quit.  I couldn't handle it.  You quit a job because of it?  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't a very good job, but it was a job.  But you quit because the boss stank.  Like, his mouth, he just had really bad breath.  Wow.  But that's kind of mean to do that, Eric.  I agree, man.  We agree.  Maybe Steve just had a bad night or something.  I don't know.  I had to take it out on someone. 
[01:07:30]  So.  All right.  Thank you, Carrie.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Was a little insensitive.  Huh?  Was a little insensitive to bring up on the air.  It was really uncomfortable, but.  Steve is brutal.  Yes.  Is that what this mic, what's this mic stink from?  It's horrible.  Was somebody eating the back of my ear?  Oh.  This is brutal.  Is that your breath?  Jesus Christ.  He took care of the problem.  Look, he's chewing gum and everything.  Chewing gum?  Your breath will smell better if you blew somebody. 
[01:08:00]  It's horrible.  I just told the poor kid that it was over.  It's not over.  Look, he's got to wear sunglasses so his eyes don't tear.  No, he's got another problem with an eye today.  He's got a leaky eye.  Leaky eyes, pussing, it's pink.  It's all red.  What?  Your eye is pussing and your breath?  Jesus Christ.  Dude, you're brutal because, you know, we go to break.  I run to the bathroom.  I take a leak.  I see Eric on the way back in.  I'm like, dude, it's over.  It's cool, you know. 
[01:08:30]  How does your eye leak?  How does an eye just start leaking?  Well, get on, Mike, Eric.  He's got, like, pink eye or something.  When they do construction around here, like, the dust and stuff irritates his eye.  It's not pink eye because pink eye is really contagious.  Let me see it.  But, yeah, check it out.  Oh, it's not leaking as you just rubbed it?  Oh, my God.  Man, Eric.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it's my day.  Wow.  Ben's leg flew in your eye, didn't it?  No, true.  That's horrible looking.  It's all red and, like, leaky.  Isn't that gross?  It looks like Grandma's poodle.  You know, like, if you have a grandma that had a little poodle, their eyes are always 
[01:09:00]  red and leaking.  You're full enough.  How old are you?  26.  Jesus, you're a mess.  Out of shape.  He's not a mess, dude.  He's not a mess, dude.  Dude, he's on the border of crying.  Let him do it.  Does he really?  Do you have a girlfriend?  What?  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  Really?  Maybe you can find somebody whose other eye is pink.  A pink eye couple.  What's going on, boss? 
[01:09:30]  Oh, nothing.  I just got back into town.  You did?  I was in, uh, well, we flew down to West Palm.  Have you ever, listen, I'm a Jew.  I was on this plane.  I swear to God, it was like 300 Jews, 90 years and above.  I swear to God, I thought they were cast in Cocoon 2 in Florida.  I swear to God, I thought it was a spaceship to heaven, okay?  I thought I'm going to die on this plane.  It was like a fucking phlegmobile.  I'm just, I'm just, that's all you heard.  And I swear to God, I swear to God, when they landed, they go, the pilot goes, anybody  need a wheelchair, raise your hand. 
[01:10:00]  Like, 600 hands.  I just walked right off the plane.  These old, wrinkled, didn't you, who, you went to Auschwitz?  Yeah.  You should have just went to West Palm or places in Brooklyn.  You didn't have to go.  I'm from West Palm.  You're from West Palm?  Yeah.  And now he lives in Brooklyn.  Yep.  What's that big hotel that's beautiful down there?  The, uh, the Trump one?  No.  No, the real big one, like with the long driveway at the, we, we drove to, look at,  we didn't stay there, obviously.  Of course not.  We stayed in like a motel, whatever.  And we just drove there to see where the nice people stay. 
[01:10:30]  Beautiful.  Some nice, I mean, money.  You talk about money.  How'd you do with your, uh, your gig?  Uh, it's horrible.  Well, it was okay.  It wasn't bad.  Do you know, I, I was on stage and there's a lady taking pictures.  So I found out it was the owner's wife just taking pictures.  So she was getting up.  I mean, it's the owner's mother.  So she's leaving.  I go, you know, are you married?  Are you seeing anybody?  You know, it's just, I think I like them all down in Florida.  I hope he's witnessed that. 
[01:11:00]  I'm married.  I go, I, you know, I mean, it'd be great, you know, if we hooked up because maybe I get  a raise coming back here, you know, because of my stepson.  And then the owner got a little tipped off because I'm hitting on his mom.  Yeah.  It's a numbers game.  You know what I'm saying?  What's the oldest broad you've ever betted?  The oldest broad?  Yeah.  This one broad, she had a really pink eye.  I never betted.  Oh, I did once, like a 50-something-year-old lady years ago up in Springfield, Mass.  And I was younger than that.  She was tight, though.  I'm telling you, man.  She was tight.  Jesus.  50-something. 
[01:11:30]  She was like a grandmother, man.  Of course she was tight.  She hasn't had sex in 20 years.  I'm telling you, once I broke through the cobwebs.  Oh.  And she wasn't bald because she shaved.  She just lost all her hair down there.  She was an older one.  A few gray ones poking out.  It was nice.  Very good.  Now I don't have to do that anymore.  All right.  I think, you know, people are going to moan again here, Anthony, but I think I want to 
[01:12:00]  talk to Lady Di today.  Why?  I might have some information, and I've got to get to the bottom of it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Some new information or the same old crap?  Some very good new information.  Yeah.  Has Ben around to maybe call Lady Di, see if she's awake?  See?  That's why we love Eric.  Look at him.  He jumped up, and he's taking care of it.  There he goes.  She's probably awake.  She's probably been drinking all night.  All right.  Anthony.  What'd she do?  Moving on with the show.  We were talking about the old Bugs Bunny cartoons and all that. 
[01:12:30]  Love those.  Yesterday, and how the cartoons used to be kind of racist and making fun of Japs and  stuff.  Yeah.  Remember all that?  Violent and racist back in the day.  Yeah.  During World War II, obviously there wasn't much TV back then.  They used to play them in the movie theaters, and they were really gauged towards adults.  During World War II, they goofed on Nazis, on the Japs.  Yeah.  We all hated the Japs during World War II.  And then if you go back a little further, there are some really racist ones, too. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Where they were really ragging on the blacks.  Well, Eric brought in World War II propaganda audio.  Oh.  What?  Did he pick up an Auschwitz?  Yeah.  Did he get those at the Auschwitz gift shop during his tour?  On the way down?  Yeah.  He got some gold teeth.  And a little Auschwitz t-shirt.  It's songs and other things that we did to kind of rally the nation and rally the troops. 
[01:13:30]  Uh-huh.  I had a gas in Auschwitz.  Oh.  You're Jewish, bro.  I know.  He's a Jew with tattoos.  Yeah.  How into it could he really be?  If I could get a star on sale, a cross on sale, I'd buy it.  Yeah.  What made you get that first hat, knowing that you were pretty much throwing yourself out  of your religion by getting it?  And you know what the sad thing is?  I can't be buried in a Jew cemetery now.  And I got a tattoo of a Jewish star.  So I can't be buried in a Catholic.  It's like a Star David.  He tattoos. 
[01:14:00]  It just doesn't make any sense.  You know what?  That whole thing is bullshit about getting tattoos.  And you know, because they say you can't deface your body.  Right.  But how many Jews or people in general, since we're on the Jews, get facelifts, nose jobs,  earrings?  Oh.  That's all defacing your body.  That's a good point.  So you know, if that's the case, then there'd be two people in a Jew cemetery.  Okay?  That's a good point.  You know.  There you have it.  All right.  They're still not going to be able to get in with those tats.  I really care when I'm dead. 
[01:14:30]  I've died so many times on stage.  Who cares?  The fact is, you do not die on stage.  I know.  I don't.  You only die on the radio.  I don't.  No.  I've been reading the boards.  And 33 out of 36 liked me last time.  All right.  Really?  Yeah.  You're obsessed with those boards.  They hate everything.  Huh?  They'll pick apart everything.  Oh.  I live on it.  Anthony and I could go home knowing we just had a great show.  And then you go on those message boards, and they'll still pick it apart and find something  they just didn't like.  You know, there was two minutes there that I thought the guys were really just not on 
[01:15:00]  top of their game.  Yeah.  I was reading the boards last night.  I was reading a little.  Actually, I think I posted a couple of times.  Uh-huh.  It was, did you like the old N.E.W. show better than you like this show?  They throw questions out for each other on the board.  So I'm reading it, and some people are commenting how they loved the old show.  They liked it better.  We had better.  One guy goes, we had better guests.  On the old show? 
[01:15:30]  On the old show, and he finds himself listening to the old MP3s of the old show instead of  the replay of this show.  And I had to remind him, yeah, great guests when we first started at N.E.W.  People forget when we first started there.  They're thinking of all the good stuff we did and all the stuff that's on MP3 that you  could download.  That wasn't the entire time we were there and every bit that we've ever done.  How about Kenny Wayne Shepard as one of our guests?  Sheryl Crow.  Sheryl Crow. 
[01:16:00]  If you will.  These great guests.  How about when we had a break to play Do You Think I'm Sexy?  If You Want My Body and You Think I'm Sexy?  When we had to stop and play that because we were playing music.  They forget the first few months we were at N.E.W.  A few months.  It was about the first year.  About a year.  Basically, what they're listening to is four years of our greatest hits.  Right.  We've only done three months here at XM Saturday.  And I think our first three months here blows away.  The first three months at N.E.W.  Without a doubt.  And it's only going to get better as time goes by. 
[01:16:30]  But these morons get on there and just start critiquing it like we were at N.E.W.  We're still at N.E.W.  But this is the show we're doing now.  We just changed.  No, no, no.  It's a work in progress.  Not only that.  You think of it this way.  We were off the air for a couple of years.  A couple of years.  Now, if we were on the air during that time, we would have changed because our show has  constantly changed over time.  I believe it's evolving.  Evolving.  Right. 
[01:17:00]  And you wouldn't have really noticed it because we would have been on the air for those two  years.  It's like watching somebody and you see them.  You don't notice their hair is getting longer or something.  But if you don't see them for a couple of years and they never got a haircut, you'd go,  wow, the guy got long hair.  Wow, he really changed.  Yeah, it's one of those things where if we were on the air, you wouldn't have noticed  the change.  But in two years, we changed as people.  We have different opinions about life things.  And we discuss maybe different topics in different ways on the show. 
[01:17:30]  I'm not as angry anymore.  Right.  It's just the way it is.  And people are, well, slow down.  And the reason I'm not angry as much anymore is because I'm happy here.  There you go.  I was absolutely miserable at WNAW.  I felt like they just didn't get our show and the potential it had.  Even though we got syndicated and stuff, but it took forever to get syndicated and they  still didn't respect us or what we did.  Pots to the battle.  Even though we were getting huge ratings all over the country, we were still being treated 
[01:18:00]  like second class citizens.  And I took out my frustration on the management and the people we worked with and the equipment  because no one cared.  You know, here they seem to, believe it or not, they seem to get it a lot more than the  old play.  So I'm not going to fake the anger.  No.  I'm actually happy.  Someone else posted, oh, they didn't care.  I liked when they didn't care if they got fired or not. 
[01:18:30]  And then use Sex for Sam as an example.  It's like, excuse me.  And I even posted on this one.  I said, excuse me.  There was never a point where we didn't care if we got fired.  What are you, the day before you got, the day before you guys got fired, we were supposed  to do that tour, right?  You know, it was going to be like in the, yeah, Voss was, Voss was sitting at this huge  comedy tour.  We had a tour.  Colin, Patrice, and Orton.  So the day before you got, I go out and buy a new Mercedes, right?  The next day you get fired and I'm sitting with a $450 car payment and nothing. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Nothing.  And me and Opie are high-fiving each other going, yeah, we did it.  We got fired.  Just like we wanted to.  You know, in the long run, it helped us and we said that all along when we were off the  air.  You know, we had to get past the fact that we weren't going to do radio for over two  years.  But Anthony and I talked a lot saying, you know, eventually this is only, believe it or  not, going to make us bigger.  That's just how this crap works.  We never try to get fired.  Jesus.  You insane.  Norton and I would do it nights.  That was the, yeah, that was one of the tamer things we've done, believe it or not. 
[01:19:30]  And you go, what?  Are you kidding?  I mean, we could list a bunch of things that we should have got fired for, but we didn't.  Yeah.  Even the message boards, I mean, you'll get some good posts.  I mean, Cringe usually has good stuff.  CringeHumor.net.  Yeah, I think Cringe.  There are some cool people.  Actually, the majority of the people are pretty cool on the message boards, but there's a few  of them that just, either they really don't get it, or they're just plain stupid people.  Like, there are some real morons that post, and you're like, what are you? 
[01:20:00]  You're a complete idiot.  I used to read the message boards from Last Comic Standing, and we did one show where  it was a roast.  We roasted Jay Moore.  It was a roast.  And people on the message boards go, well, they were kind of mean.  He was sarcastic.  It's a roast.  It's a roast, you fucking idiot.  Yeah, they don't get it.  Don't you get the definition of a roast?  You know.  When you're being completely sarcastic on this show, and you say something, and someone  posts like you meant what you said.  Yeah, the whole, it's only $50,000, Jim Norton.  Yeah.  You know, yeah, hey, Jim, lighten up.  Maybe $50,000 isn't a lot for you, but for us. 
[01:20:30]  That is a perfect example.  I'm like, are you kidding?  It was the sarcasm.  Obviously, $50,000 is a lot of money.  That's the joke.  You know, Jimmy's sitting there complaining that he lost out on $50,000.  He was supposed to get a huge raise just before he got fired.  And Opie goes, relax, Jim.  It's only $50,000.  It's no big deal.  You know, that's a lot of money.  I'm just busting his balls, you know.  And somebody writes, you know, Opie shouldn't say $50,000 isn't a lot of money.  It makes him look.  And you've got to respond.  You've got to respond with, you are the dumbest son of a bitch I've ever read from. 
[01:21:00]  You do.  That's why you can't take the message board seriously.  Well, you can't, but there's certain people.  You know, there's one guy, Kid Nigger, Africa.  I don't remember his name.  Kid Africa.  We used to fight back and forth all the time, you know.  Yeah.  And he's probably just some little, you know, fat, dumpy guy that doesn't leave the house,  doesn't get laid, you know, and he sits there and his life is.  And you're getting all pissed off, slamming the keyboard.  Out of my mind.  Out of my mind.  Dude, I don't get pissed off anymore.  It used to drive me nuts. 
[01:21:30]  It's funny.  OpieAnthony.net, they've been begging me to promote them more.  And, you know, hey, we noticed you haven't been on the board lately, you know.  So I'm like, eh, might as well go on and see what these guys are up to.  It's been a while.  And right away, there's like two or three threads just trashing me.  I'm like, well, all right, I'll see you guys later.  That's what they do.  How can the word trash you?  Your name is the title.  It's amazing.  It's a whole thread about what I do and don't do for the radio show.  People don't understand what it takes to put this together at all. 
[01:22:00]  We all understand our roles.  They hear it coming out of the speaker.  And that's it.  There's no clue as to what each of our roles are, how important everyone is, how the show  couldn't be the show without each person in their place doing what they do.  But, yeah, you'll read on the message board and just go, shut up, you uninformed tool.  It used to drive me nuts because people don't understand all the stuff I do behind the scenes  that makes this show, okay?  That's one of my big roles as far as the Opie and Anthony program goes. 
[01:22:30]  But, like I said, they only understand what comes through the speaker.  Right, right.  Nothing as to the organization of the show.  So if I'm not funny enough, all of a sudden I'm like some drag on the radio program or something.  Yeah, but you know what?  Nowadays, instead of reviews, you know big actors and musicians are going to message boards, too.  You absolutely know.  Everybody is like, you know, for movies.  Probably Dustin Hoffman is sitting home going, I don't believe they just said this about me.  I did Marathon. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, of course, because we're all human and we all have egos.  There are some people that acknowledge it and other people don't, but you know they all read them.  You got to.  You got to read them because it's a review almost.  So you're almost like drawn into it.  Kevin Smith has his own website, viewaskew.com, and he's got a message board on there.  And he posts on it.  And they did a whole goof on it on Jay and Silent Bob, where they were goofing on the fact that their fans just tool them.  You are fucking clown shoes. 
[01:23:30]  It's hysterical, man.  And they just, they'll pound you.  But you know these celebrities just pop on and start reading.  But with all that said, I believe, you know, pretty much everything should be on the message boards, you know.  I mean, Howard Stern has a message board and, you know, you trash him or you're a fan of this show and you go on there, you're instantly banned.  We just don't do that type of thing, you know.  I just, we don't have a message board is what it is.  Right.  Officially, we don't run a message board.  Right, right.  You know, so it's not like we're going on.  We let the fans do it. 
[01:24:00]  But you've got to make the yarn.  And there's message boards that come and go because, you know, there's things that make one message board more popular than the other.  Well, there's three.  There's three that I go to cringe.  There's a lot more than that.  There's a wowfans.com.  There's cringehumor.net, opianthony.net, whackbag.com.  There was Save Opie and Anthony.  I don't even know if that's around anymore.  There are some of these websites that these guys run and they have their own rules and regulations on them as to what they want added on there and what they won't allow and language they won't allow, things like that. 
[01:24:30]  And that's their prerogative, you know.  It's their message board.  I love when people go on there and go, why was my post deleted?  Freedom of speech.  It's not freedom of speech.  It's this guy's message board.  And it's up to him what he wants or doesn't want on it.  People are so quick to pull out that freedom of speech.  You pay the bandwidth charges, asshole.  Right.  And then we'll see.  Then you can say what should or shouldn't be on there.  I had a message board on my website.  That lasted a day, like the first few posts. 
[01:25:00]  Go fuck yourself.  You stink.  I want to bang your daughters.  You know, this is coming down.  This is coming down.  I can't deal with this.  This is coming right down.  All from Jimmy Norton.  Kill yourself.  See, Anthony and I have been doing this internet thing for, we were one of the first radio shows.  We really were.  I mean, we were way in the beginning when Ant was updating, you know, after the show.  I invented the internet.  I'm dropping.  Honestly, when not many people had computers in their homes yet.  No.  And this is only going back like 10, not even 10 years.  It's when people still had like those old 486s in their house. 
[01:25:30]  And, you know, it was, you watch pictures scroll down and it took forever to download a little piece of pornography.  It still does on mine.  Yeah, we got excited because we had a real popular show in Boston and our website back then, if we got 100 hits, we're like, oh my God, wow, this is unbelievable.  Now we get, Foundry Music gets, I don't even know anymore, but a ridiculous amount of hits every day.  We were videotaping stuff, putting video clips up on the websites, which back then was just unheard of. 
[01:26:00]  There was no compression, so these files were giant.  And I got a bandwidth charge one month for like $5,000 back then, and I was making nothing.  I lost my mind.  I did not know because who knew, you know?  I had this server, and I didn't read any fine print.  I'm like, oh, I'll put stuff up on this website, and people can download it.  And I'm taking video of these girls that are coming into the studio doing things and uncompressed.  I'm taking uncompressed video and putting it up for people to download.  And they're downloading it and just, I mean, bandwidth up the ass. 
[01:26:30]  And I get this bill, and I lost my mind.  I called the guy at the server and was just like, you've got to help me out here.  I can't pay this.  I can't do this.  You've got to help me out and tell me what uncompressed means.  Oh.  Poor Lady Di.  She's a computer expert.  No.  She'll help you out.  Are we going to get Lady Di on the phone?  We keep getting her answering machine.  All right.  Well, I mean, it could wait.  Maybe she's laying by the phone with the vacuum cleaner going and her shoe off a little askew.  Oh, my God. 
[01:27:00]  Very good.  So, write whatever you want.  Have fun.  It used to get to me a lot more than it does now.  I know it gets to Voss.  That's why I brought it up.  Not as much as, you know, after the last.  All right.  So, World War II propaganda audio, Anthony.  From cartoons.  Eric, where did you get this from?  The website's right on the bottom of the page there.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  It's an authenticity site.  You know what?  Lady Di's on the line.  So, why don't we take a quick break and we'll get to the – this isn't a tease. 
[01:27:30]  We just went off on a tangent.  We'll do the propaganda audio and we'll talk to Lady Di when we get back.  And going into break, Anthony, pick another one.  Our meaty-breasted friend is in Chicago.  We've got Voss sitting in today.  And we're featuring tracks from Jim Norton's Yellow Discipline CD that you can get at eatabullet.com.  What do you want to hear?  Wow.  I want to hear – let's go for something else other than – I don't even know if it's – Aspen Sure is Expensive.  Oh, nice.  What's that going? 
[01:28:00]  Eight.  Eight.  It's about getting a hooker in Aspen.  Oh, of course.  It's a whole –  You know what you really take for granted for in our part of the country, too?  The 24-hour convenience you have.  It really never shuts down.  You can always go out and get whatever you want, whatever you want.  At 3 o'clock in the morning, you can get truck tires, pizza, and a bag of heroin.  I'm the same Puerto Rican.  It is not like that in other places.  I was in Aspen, Colorado, performing at a comedy festival. 
[01:28:30]  And Aspen closes at 10 o'clock.  You know, because it's a ski town and they're all yuppie douchebags.  Let's get up early, get on the slopes.  I hate skiing, and when people are killed doing it, good.  That's what you deserve if you're 40 going down a snowy hill yelling,  Weeeeee.  But I didn't know it closed. 
[01:29:00]  I had never been there.  So it was like 2 o'clock in the morning.  I was starving.  There's nothing open.  I'm like, all right.  I'll call an escort service.  Maybe she'll have a snack in her purse.  And if you think, like, Jersey, New York, or even Vegas is expensive, Aspen was offensive.  Because I'm on the phone, and I'm like, well, how much is it to see somebody?  And the woman's like, $3,000. 
[01:29:30]  I'm like, what?  And then she's like, well, she's really pretty.  What does that mean?  Do I get to cut her head off and keep it when I'm finished?  So I can show my landlord why I'm not paying rent?  That's a lot of cash for pretty.  Can you send over a deformed girl for $50,000? 
[01:30:00]  Maybe a hair lip or a burn victim.  I don't want to get married.  Have sex.  I'll laugh at her a little.  Then send her back.  Then I had to ask a really important question.  I'm like, all right, well, for how long?  Because length of time determines if it's a good deal or not.  You know, because if she just said six months, all right.  But she didn't know if I was a cop or not. 
[01:30:30]  So I'm like, well, for how long?  And she's like, until you're finished?  Not a good deal.  I did a little math.  That's $180,000 an hour.  Because I am like a burglar in bed.  I don't even wake a girl half the time, just kind of jostle her.  Look at that.  Nothing.  Dude, what happened? 
[01:31:00]  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was.  You know what I hate?  When you're driving and you pick up a friend and they get in and they don't buckle their  seatbelt up like right away, but they will like 10 minutes into the drive after you have 
[01:31:30]  some goofy turn.  Without sending to you, they'll just, you know, pull that belt down.  Oh, you got a problem all of a sudden?  So what I do, as they're looking down, I go, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, these darn mosquitoes.  I don't know why I let them bother me like that.  I really shouldn't.  Yes, indeedy boy. 
[01:32:00]  I got a jaywalking ticket yesterday.  Motherfuckers ain't got shit better to do than to fuck with you for jaywalking.  And that lets you know how deep the government is in your business.  How the fuck else I'm going to get across the street?  What?  You know what I'm saying?  You're jaywalking.  Oh, ain't that a bitch.  It's like the first motherfucker that did that shit, his name must have been Jay.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:32:30]  Jay's like, I'm tired of being the last one at the bank.  Fuck it, I'm going now.  A little cop there with his whistle.  Hey, Jay, hey, in my hands.  Fuck your hand.  I'm going to the bank.  Then everybody else.  Jay's always the first one in line.  Let's go when Jay goes.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:33:00]  Shit became an epidemic.  They're all jaywalking.  You know what I'm saying?  What they going to do when somebody in the wheelchair do it?  Call it Mike Roland?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[01:33:30]  Love the gambling.  Yeah, we were just talking about gambling during the break.  We got Rich Voss filling in for Jim Norton.  Not really filling in.  Rich Voss is here today.  Let's just...  I don't buy the gambling addiction thing.  Are you kidding me?  I used to what?  It's not like drugs where you can say, you know, you had a relapse if you do it. 
[01:34:00]  Listen, here's what triggers.  Gambling is the same as drugs because if you're addicted, if it clicks, there's times I've stayed up 24 hours just nonstop.  Yeah, but everyone's done that.  Yeah, but how many people go up to the room and come back down and sell gold off their neck, go to pawn stores, right, take golf clubs, you know, do whatever they can.  To gamble?  To gamble.  I mean, I sat at the table.  I was just so...  You are an addictive mess.  And lost $5,000 at the crap table in like, you know, three or four hours, which is relevant. 
[01:34:30]  You know, I mean, I saw people lose, you know, 25 or 50 grand, but I would lose money.  I would yell at people playing craps.  It's so funny.  When the crap table's hot and people are winning, everybody's high-fiving, like you can have the head of the clan in Farrakhan high-fiving, you know, hey, this is...  You know, and then you start losing, and you look over, and you go, you fucking stupid zipper, throw the dice off them, you know?  I'm yelling at people.  I swear to God, I smashed the table. 
[01:35:00]  I was throwing off a fucking crap thing.  I threw my hands in the air once, and the lady behind me, the waitress, had a tray full of drinks, and she was right behind me.  I threw my hair.  All the drinks went flying in the air, you know?  Listen, I'm not...  You are an addictive mess.  I've gotten kicked out of casinos for cursing and yelling, and they're going, you can't curse you.  I go, it's a goddamn casino with alcohol, smoking, everything.  I can't curse you, fucking idiots.  Yeah, I don't like that whole thing that you can't curse.  Yeah, how can you not curse?  You really can't curse at the tables? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, at the tables, if you say, like, whoa, you know, they'll bitch at you.  It's just so weird there's a fine line that makes something an addiction, because we all drink heavily at times, but what, you know, throws you over to the...  Puts you over the edge.  Puts you over to the alcoholics, dude.  I love gambling, you know?  I play party poker online.  Uh-huh.  It's, you know, Texas Hold'em.  I played online.  Last night, Royal Flush.  First one I've ever hit in, like, a year of playing.  It flopped me a Royal Flush, like, right off the bat. 
[01:36:00]  What did you win?  Knew I had it.  I was only in the 2-4 room, so I won about 50 bucks.  But it was...  When it flopped, I was like, eh, I won!  There was nights in casinos, I would just walk to, on my way to my room, like, I mean, tapped out and have, like, $5 left, you know, and I get that.  What did you do, five bucks?  And then I'd go to get, just to keep gambling, I'd play nickel slots for another hour, you know, just to sit there so I have some action going.  Oh, something.  You know, and then I would look at the penny slot players and go, ugh, white trash.  You know, look at those crazy playing penny slots. 
[01:36:30]  Rich, as an addictive person who is addicted to gambling and now can't gamble, or you'll have a relapse, what is it about the gambling that drew you to it and addicted you to it?  Is it you're looking for the big win?  Is it the actual just gambling?  Is it losing?  What is it that...  I don't...  I started gambling when I was in fourth grade, though.  You know, we were pitching quarters, playing roulette in fourth grade, you know.  When did you get a roulette table? 
[01:37:00]  My friend had this game that had, like, you know, 30 games in one, racetrack and horse.  I remember that game.  Remember that game?  Yeah, it was like one thing, and it had a roulette wheel, it had a racetrack, a place for, like, blackjack.  It had everything.  Craps, little craps table.  I mean, I was nine years old.  I started gambling.  And then, you know, just maybe fucking two more hugs as a kid, I'd have a normal life.  Oh, just two.  Well, everything goes back to, you know, you don't get the attention growing up, you know, or whatever.  So you're lashing out, and you're doing everything. 
[01:37:30]  You're looking for something else.  You're looking for something.  So I started off young, you know.  In Hebrew school, I got, you know, kicked out pretty much at Hebrew school.  I had to go to Hebrew school, which really sucks.  Were you playing the dreidel?  No, you go to regular school, and then the bus picks you up at Hebrew school.  And I would, you know, try to...  And I used to work the canteen at the Hebrew school where you sold candy, and I would steal  the money, right, at the Hebrew school, and then go gamble with it.  You know, this is like in sixth grade.  I was still in Hebrew school gambling money.  I mean, candy money, right?  And then I got caught, so I got in trouble for stealing the candy money, you know. 
[01:38:00]  So where does this all come from, you think?  What happened as a kid that just set you down this road, or do you think you're just born  with this addiction?  I don't know.  I just, you know, I get bored easy.  You need some action going.  You just need action.  You just need it, you know.  Rich is the kind of guy that just needs action.  And when you're gambling, is it the win?  Do you go like, oh, I won't.  You know, so funny.  I was in Vegas once, and I'm up, I'm up like two grand.  You know, I'm Mr. High Roller.  I'm tipping everybody, you know, throwing money around, like, you know, right? 
[01:38:30]  I swear to God, that was like on Wednesday.  Come Saturday, I was eating 19-cent chicken sandwiches at AM, PM, gas station.  I'm not, you know, I'm fucking, right now, I got my friend.  I'm a high roller.  I know.  Like, my friend, like, I'm staying in, I can tell you some Vegas stories.  So my friend comes to hang out with me, you know, when I'm working in Vegas.  So he got a girl there.  So every time he brings the girl back to my room to bang her, I can't come in. 
[01:39:00]  I got to go back down to the tables, you know, and lose another three, four, five hundred.  So every time he got laid, it cost me five hundred dollars, you know.  So I just lost, you know, all the money.  And now, you know, I'm, I'm, I can, you know.  You can see him throwing money around like he's rich.  A mere bag of shit.  Why, he gave a hundred dollars to the repairman just to take the clicking out of the phone.  I was in Vegas, like, when me and my wife got divorced.  Yeah.  When we got divorced.  So we were separated. 
[01:39:30]  We were separated for two months.  We're separated for two months.  But we lived together still, you know, through the separation.  We still bang every now and then.  But, you know, we do.  And it was a hard, it's horrible.  You go through a divorce, but living together.  So I was going to work in Vegas.  And as I'm working, as I'm going out there that week, she's moving out.  She's taking everything, moving out.  And my, you know, taking the kids, you know.  So I know I'm going to come back from Vegas to an empty house.  Yeah.  No more kids there, you know.  So now I'm in Vegas, and, you know, I get there, I'm down every bit of, you know, I've lost, already lost my, I lost money before I checked in. 
[01:40:00]  Where would you like your luggage?  Back in the fucking car.  Okay?  That's why I want my luggage.  All right?  So, I mean, I'm already down a couple grand.  My wife, I would walk off stage and just walk out and cry.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  You're in Vegas, and you see, like, in the summer, there's happy families, you know, and there's couples, right?  And they're all, you know, playing. 
[01:40:30]  And I'm broke, childless.  With your failed marriage?  With my failed marriage.  I'm telling you, I spent a week in Vegas crying.  Oh, that's horrible.  And I'd walk to the tables, and I'd lose more money.  I had nothing.  Oh, that's awful.  It's depressing.  That's really awful.  Poor Rich.  It's so awful that Anthony's finding something to make him sound even more awful.  That's all right.  I'll let him off the hook.  I worked. 
[01:41:00]  Let me say hi to Dave here.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hanging out with Rich Voss today.  We got Lady Di on the phone.  We got lots to do today.  Awesome.  All right.  Gambling is definitely an addiction.  I had a roommate that had an online internet gambling account, and he deposited money in his  account by calling a 1-900 number and charging it to the phone account.  Of course, I didn't know this until the phone company threatened to shut off my phone.  Oh, you were in on him with the phone? 
[01:41:30]  That's right.  And 1-900 number.  $1,500 phone bill.  Go.  And he was taking the bills, and he was hiding them, so I wasn't even getting them.  Wow.  Wait, I don't understand the scam here.  He was online gambling, and the way you deposit money into your online account, you could call  a 900 number, and they'll bill it to your phone.  So they get the money.  You put it in your account, but it's being billed to your telephone bill.  Oh, okay.  Okay, okay.  So now he's sharing the phone with this guy, so now this guy's in for part of the money. 
[01:42:00]  The phone's in my name.  Everything's in my name.  Oh, so you're totally screwed.  I have no credit, so everything is in my name.  He also happened to have a little bit of a drug problem, too, so that's probably connected.  So that's what makes me think the whole gambling thing, the addiction, very addictive personality  to begin with.  Well, if you wanted to help him, really, what you do is, as he's hitting his bottom, you  make him perform oral on you for money, and then he hits you.  Then you know you hit bottom.  But who could get, like, I could never gamble online. 
[01:42:30]  I want to see what's going on.  How do you trust what's really going on, you know, with the computer?  How do you know if you're, you know, you're cheating?  I ask Ant that all the time, because he plays after the show just a little bit.  He's just having fun, and I'm thinking, is there cheat codes involved?  You know what you got to do?  You find one of the most reputable online ones, and you play on that.  You don't play with any shady, shady online companies.  I was in Pittsburgh last week.  A guy had the back of his neck pierced.  You know, it's by the spine, right?  He goes, well, the best piercer in town did it. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, yeah?  Well, you know what?  What, only two people are crippled?  Okay, so how do you know who's reputable?  I mean...  By just the sheer volume of people that play it.  Really?  Yeah.  The one I play is partypoker.com, and it's like the one that everybody plays.  Let me tell you there.  I don't know.  I haven't seen anything that would lead me to believe anything's a scam.  I've been playing with the same...  I think I put about 200 bucks in, and I've been playing with the same 200 bucks.  You know, it goes up, it goes down.  It's just fun to play, but for a while. 
[01:43:30]  Have you ever shot craps?  No.  I have no idea how craps work.  Craps is...  It looks exciting.  It's the crack of gambling.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  I would step over a naked broad to shoot craps.  To shoot craps?  Yeah, yeah.  Get out of here.  I'm going to play craps.  I'm not lying.  I swear to God, I was in Vegas once, and I pick up a waitress, right?  Or not a waitress, just some girl after the show.  And she goes...  You know, I used to do this all the time when I picked up girls here.  I would bang them, and I'd go, look, let me go down and get us something to eat. 
[01:44:00]  And I'd go gamble, and then run back up.  And one girl, I said, look, I'm hungry.  And she goes, if you get me an English muffin, I'll give you an anal.  I go, I swear to God.  But I ran down to gamble instead.  I did come back with a cold English muffin.  How long would you be gone with these chicks waiting in the room?  I don't know.  A long time.  Who knows?  They were drunk.  They didn't know.  They were blastered.  Let's go to Colorado.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  My wife would like to kill me when we were in Vegas on our honeymoon.  I sat down at a blackjack table with 500 bucks. 
[01:44:30]  I played for four hours.  At one point, I was up almost 20 grand.  I gave it all back.  Are you kidding?  No.  I gave every last bit of it back.  I mean, literally, I was up 20 grand.  And my wife says, how much money do you got there?  I said, oh, I don't know.  And the dealer said, there's about 20,000 in front of you.  Well, I said, oh, let me have to.  I said, hell no.  I said, I'm going to keep playing.  And I started playing.  All right.  But what was the logic in your head?  You're up 20 grand. 
[01:45:00]  What are you thinking at that point?  I could turn this into 100?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You never have enough in front of you.  See, no kiss of death.  We were in Aruba when I was married.  And then I'm shooting craps.  I got money all over, too.  So you weren't crying in Aruba?  No.  But we went to Aruba.  And we got home the next week.  And she goes, I want a divorce.  I go, thank you for telling me now.  You couldn't have told me a week ago when I spent.  So I'm shooting craps.  Stop whining.  The worst part about mine is my wife and I were there on our honeymoon. 
[01:45:30]  That was the third day of our honeymoon.  I didn't get sex for the rest of the week when she found out I gave it all back.  Wow.  I like your part, Eric.  Thank you.  You lost it.  You get just a weird, I don't know, you just get a weird feeling when you're at that blackjack  table.  Stupid quick story.  When we were in Vegas, I was up about $120.  Yeah.  And it was after dinner, it's getting late, and I was just tired, and I knew I just wanted  to go to bed.  Yeah.  So I just started making stupid bets. 
[01:46:00]  And then as soon as I lost it all, it was like, okay, now I can go to sleep.  Yeah, you play stupid.  You start playing stupid because it's like, I don't feel like investing in the next three  or four hours sitting here.  Uh-huh.  So I started getting lazy, like, ah, maybe I'll go for the quick win.  The big fix.  Either the quick win, or I'll go to bed and I'll be satisfied, you know, that I'm not  leaving any money on the table and wonder.  It's just weird.  When you do the slow build, when you really dedicate yourself to the game, for a bunch of  hours, you're going to sit there, and you just do the slow build. 
[01:46:30]  You play the way you play.  You'll do fine.  When you lose a few and you try to make it up on that one bet, that's when you're going  to watch your pile go down.  I was making $50 bets.  I mean, I saw you.  You were making two $250 bets on, you know, whatever.  But I was doing it because I was like, I just want to, it was a weird feeling I got.  Like, I just want to lose this money fast because I'm really tired.  I just want to go to bed.  Yeah, people do that.  Yep.  You know, and I just threw away a quick $120 plus my initial investment.  I ended up losing $110. 
[01:47:00]  So it was like a $230 turnaround just because I was tired.  Because you get tired when I go to your room.  I get Western Union sending people, you know, I call them to send me money.  But you just, you know, I couldn't do that quick build at Blackjack.  That's boring.  I mean, you know, I wouldn't put my money in stock.  Not at all.  It's a whole, you got to get at a cool table with some fun people.  Yeah.  Then you have a good time.  Anthony and I were sitting side by side and Club Soda Kenny was there.  It's just like a social event.  For a gambler like Vosco, it's not about having fun.  Fun people?  Who wants to meet friends at a table? 
[01:47:30]  Okay, see, that's the difference between what we were doing and what you were explaining  earlier, the addiction.  Because to me, it was like, oh, free drinks.  The dealer was fun.  That lady Sharon.  And we were just laughing and goofing and then making fun of the squirrely guys that were  sitting down, you know.  The coolers that come over and sit down.  Yeah, Kenny.  I mean, we're going to get him on tape to say this.  But all of a sudden, he would just whisper to Aunt and I, here comes the cooler.  Here comes the cooler.  We'll go back to minimum bets for a while.  Yeah.  And sit at the table and just chill the table off. 
[01:48:00]  That was me.  Mush.  Awful.  One week in basketball, out of 14 games, I picked 12 losers.  Do you know that's almost impossible?  That's hard to do, yeah.  That's almost impossible.  All right, let's go.  We've got to move on.  How does this Bill guy, I want to see if he's cheating.  Yeah, no, we're going to go to both of these guys.  Oh, good.  Yeah, we've got two of them.  Kansas checking in.  It's Danny.  Go ahead, Danny.  Danny.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, silly pants.  So, yeah, this party poker thing, two things.  Me and some of my buddies have about four or five, but are now five computers in one room. 
[01:48:30]  And we'll go sit in partypoker.com, pokerroom.com, and just take two or three guys' money in like,  you know, an hour or 20 minutes, sit at maybe a 10-20 table.  So that's the way you can get easily taken.  You need different IPs, though, for each computer, my friend.  No, I understand.  Yeah, they won't let you on line.  If you're at home, and let's say, you know, because I have about three computers set up at my house,  and I try to log on all three to one table, they won't allow it.  Yeah, we have five different lines coming in our house. 
[01:49:00]  Five different lines coming in.  And then you've got to find a table that you can all get at.  And then if somebody comes, then you could kind of use each other to try to take one person's money.  Oh, I mean, the odds are sick in your favor.  I mean, and then you can lose money to the other guys so, you know, it doesn't look kind of funny.  But also, if you notice in partypoker, there's always three or four guys.  The room gives them, you know, everyone a hand, and everyone's in the hand on the flop,  so the weight keeps on going up. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, they're there to make money.  It's shady if you watch that.  I don't know.  I've done pretty well on it.  Yeah.  Like, if you really play disciplined, you'll do all right, you know?  All right.  You just can't be crazy.  Real quick, you know what's funny?  This guy said he took his wife to Vegas on her honeymoon.  I took my wife to San Francisco because I got booked a weekend there.  So I got, you know, a free hotel on my honeymoon, and I did a gig.  Cheapo.  Oh, my God, are you a cheap Jew. 
[01:50:00]  Let's go to Long Island.  Bill?  Yeah, how are you doing?  Hey.  All right, so let me tell you a little different way than he just said.  What we actually do is, you know, we have a monthly game.  We play with about 20 guys.  So five of us got together, and we go to the tournament tables, you know,  the $100 tournament tables.  Right.  So they don't fill up right away.  So you can get in there.  So we've got five guys, and we're all on cell phones.  You know, he's at his house.  He's at his house.  I'm at my house.  Everybody's on a cell phone.  We all pick the number table we're going to pick.  And then we all go to that table. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, there you go.  So we go to the table.  Now we can talk to each other about what hands we got,  because we're all on our cell phones talking to each other.  And how would that explain to the listener how that would affect  what somebody else at the table that isn't involved in your little posse?  How could that make, give you guys the advantage?  Well, it only gives us the advantage.  Like, we'll just share the money around.  If I don't have a good hand, like, right away,  we all know what our up cards are, because you can see your card.  So if I have a 2-7 offsuit, I'm already out of the hand.  But if somebody, if I'm in the hand, I've got decent cards, a pair of 6s, 
[01:51:00]  and somebody else that I know has cards has, you know, a pair of Queens,  I'll bet my hand up, because, you know, I can afford to lose some chips  if I want to lose some chips, or if I'm already down,  I'll bet my hand into his hand just to give him the money,  just so he can have more power at the table.  And it's only a 10-person table.  So, you know, if you have four or five guys in on it,  one of those five guys, you know, you have a good chance of winning.  It would give you an advantage.  Yeah.  We just spread the money around, and we win. 
[01:51:30]  You know, we win all the time.  There's always money in our account.  Yeah, I'm sure there are people doing it,  but I don't know how many people are actually conspiring at the 2-4 table.  You know what I mean?  And that's what I'm playing on.  That's the same in Vegas.  You know, you get three guys working together in Vegas.  All right, thanks, bro.  Yeah, true.  You know.  Yeah.  We'll watch out for that, though.  One more.  Rob, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  How you doing, Kyky Kykerman?  Kyky Kykerman.  Is he talking to me?  Who else could he be talking to?  Oh, it's hilarious.  He's scumbag.  Yeah, my dad used to have an account with one of those offshore betting agencies, 
[01:52:00]  and their clocks were on a two-minute delay.  So he was able to go to OTB, see the winner of a race,  and then call it in really quick, and he would, like, clean up, like, once a month.  You know, you can't keep doing it because they would catch on.  But it was, like, one of the best scams that, like, he ever did.  I've never heard of that one.  Why don't you just call me Kyky Kykerman and your father's stealing to support his family?  Kyky Kykerman.  I wanted to say welcome back to Stinky, to the O&A show. 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  Welcome back to what?  Oh.  Welcome, Stinky, back to the O&A show.  Oh.  That'll leave a bruise.  All right, we're going to move on.  We've got Lady Di that is waiting to talk to us.  I hope he's got some new information is what I'm hearing.  I think so, yeah.  If it doesn't go anywhere, we'll definitely, you know, cut her offshore.  Yeah.  We've got to hurry up with Lady Di.  Her phone card's going to run out.  Oh, I know.  She's been on hold for a half hour, and she can't pay her phone bill to begin with.  So we've got a little something-something here, and we'll be back. 
[01:53:00]  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Uh, Bill died today.  Yeah, kid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no. 
[01:53:30]  Who is this?  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big, big, big pile up. 
[01:54:00]  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Dance Party Weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.

[01:56:30]  Let's go to the phone and say hi to the cooler. 
[01:57:00]  It's Lady Di, everyone. Lady Di, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  How are you today?  Okay, pretty good.  How did the job interview go?  Huh?  Don't say hi to anyone. We're getting right to business.  He doesn't care how you're doing.  How did the job interview go?  The job interview? It went very well.  I had to fill out an application, and I have to call him back today to find out if, you know.  Well, you act like everybody fills out an application.  It's not a big deal. I filled out an application.  She goes, it went very well. She went in and filled out an application and left. 
[01:57:30]  Was that a big task for you, dummy?  And they said, don't call us. We'll call you.  How you doing, Mr. Boss?  He's not going to answer that.  Just go ahead. What was your job interview for?  At a restaurant.  At a waitress.  I thought it was an interview.  Yes, but they had me fill out an application.  I gave them my phone number first, but now they have me fill out an application.  As a waitress?  Yes.  So they didn't interview you.  Basically, you know, there's help wanted signs.  Right.  I see them all over the city, and you go in, and the worker there goes, oh, God, another 
[01:58:00]  one of you, zero.  Sure, here's an application.  Fill it out, and maybe someone will get back to you.  Thank you.  Yeah, we don't want to toss that.  One of probably a hundred people that have walked through that restaurant to fill out  that application.  We don't want a statuesque blonde as our hostess.  Yes, I know.  Wouldn't they want somebody that's not going to ruin their appetite?  I mean.  Yeah, really?  No, no, no, no.  They told me that they had me fill out an application, and I'm supposed to call him back sometime  today.  They told you?  They told you to call them back? 
[01:58:30]  Well, actually, he's supposed to call me back, but I think I'm going to call him back.  Yeah, don't call us.  We'll call you.  So you never talked to a manager or anything or the owner of the place, right?  It's the owner of the place.  But you never spoke to him.  All you did was walk in, say, hi, can I have an application?  No.  Filled it out.  I walked in, and I said, you know, I asked for the owner, and I sat at the bar, and I  had Sprite.  I didn't have anything to drink.  I had Sprite.  Two glasses of Sprite. 
[01:59:00]  Well, look at you.  Showing some self-control.  You were able to not drink during a job interview.  During your job interview.  That's great.  That's right.  All right.  She probably told the guy that, too.  Yeah.  I'm not drinking.  I'm not drinking.  He doesn't even know that she's an alcoholic mess.  He doesn't know I drink anyway.  Oh, yeah.  No, they can't tell.  They can't look at you and say, what went wrong?  Yeah, they can't tell.  By the stringy hair and the tomato face.  The yellow eyes.  Right.  And the broken blood vessels in your nose. 
[01:59:30]  No.  That's not true.  The Carl Maldon nose.  We couldn't tell you were an alcoholic.  Really.  Two different color socks and one sneaker.  We couldn't tell you had a problem.  All right.  No.  No.  No.  No.  So you sat down at the bar.  Yeah.  And who gave you the application?  The owner.  The owner was actually there.  Yeah.  And did you speak with this owner and tell him your qualifications?  Yes.  And what did you say?  Well, you know, he knows because I put it down in the application. 
[02:00:00]  He knows I used to be a waitress before because I was a waitress before.  During your acting career, right?  Huh?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  How long ago was that?  How long ago?  You know.  I think I just got out of high school.  You know, Lady Di, the reality is that these restaurant owners hire the hottest applicants.  Well.  Yeah.  Because there's no real skills involved as far as getting someone's food.  Right.  So now they're thinking, okay, I got all these people that came in, they're going to remember 
[02:00:30]  the hot blonde that maybe just got out of college and is in between jobs and, you know,  could help him out for maybe, I don't know, a season or something.  A guy might invite his friends to dinner and go, hey, you want to go to this restaurant?  There's this babe working there, man.  You've got to check her out.  The reality is, you know, prove me wrong.  They hire hot, hot women to be the waitresses.  The hottest of the applicants.  We went out last night to eat and the waitress was so hot.  And I go to Bonnie, I go, you know, she's from Russia.  She's so hot. 
[02:01:00]  You know, she's banging the owner, you know, just to stay in the country.  Right.  You know.  I mean, you've got to have something to bring to the table, Lady Di.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Aside from your huge appetite.  Yeah.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Huge appetite.  Shut up.  John.  Shut up.  John.  Listen.  I worked at a restaurant, and we'd be hiring.  These chicks would come in, and they'd ask for an application.  And you'd say, yeah, here you go.  You know, throw out the application, and somebody will call you.  And if the chick was hot, you'd put a little mark, like an H, in the top corner. 
[02:01:30]  And it would be a disgusting mess.  Yeah.  You'd put another little mark.  You'd have, like, a little code.  So this way, the manager would be going through the application.  And I'd sit there in his office while he did it.  And he'd go through, and he'd take the little, you know, the one mark.  He'd say, all right, we'll call her back.  Let her interview.  See if she's going to work.  And the other ones go right in the fucking garbage.  Yeah.  I mean, discrimination is.  That's where your fucking application went.  Yeah.  Discrimination is happening big time in the restaurant business.  Trust me. 
[02:02:00]  How do you feel about that, Lady Di?  Your old garbage application.  I'm not saying anything.  I'm not, you know, I'm not saying a word.  If they hire me, that's great.  Well, they're not going to hire you.  Where was it?  In Jersey?  Yeah.  Where, on 22?  No, not on 22.  No, no, no.  In Garwood.  All right.  Julie in New York.  You know what they did with her application?  Just colored in a little Laurel and Hardy mustache at the top corner.  Let everybody know.  No.  Oh, please.  She probably handed in with gravy on it.  Guys, we have a real girl calling the program.  A girl.  Julie?  Hey.  Hey, guys. 
[02:02:30]  Hey, Bob.  Hey, what's happening?  Hi, Diane.  Listen, you know, I don't usually have much sympathy for people who don't want to find a job,  but I do manage a temporary company, and if you are truly interested in getting a job,  I'll give Steve or Eric or whatever my phone number, and you can call, and I'll set up an  appointment for you.  Oh.  Oh, good.  And what is this line of work?  I manage a temporary-to-temporary-to-perm staffing company, the largest international company in the world.  Does, would Lady Di need secretarial skills, then? 
[02:03:00]  Some.  We would test her to see what she's capable of doing.  Probably hot tar or roofing.  She's capable of drinking.  We know that.  How is that?  Could she get a temp job drinking?  Well, you know, give your interns one of the phone number, and then I'll call her.  Do you have a job for a girl that hangs out with a troll?  I'm not going to waste my time, my employee's time, or my resources on someone who's not  going to pull through and actually do the job.  You've got to follow through on this, Di. 
[02:03:30]  Well, yeah.  Julie, the reality is she doesn't have the qualifications for something like this, but  we'll give it a shot.  No, no, no.  Come on.  We have to like industrial work if she can move a box.  Can you move a box?  She walks one around every day.  It's old and slowly.  All right.  Hold on, Julie.  She's a working warehouse.  All right.  We'll get Julie's info.  Get Julie's info and give it to Lady Di after we're done with her.  Okay.  Tony in the Bronx thinks Di is lying.  We know that already.  I'm not lying. 
[02:04:00]  She's a compulsive liar.  Why would I lie?  Because you're a compulsive liar.  All right.  You don't lie about things?  Well, I tell little white lies every once in a while, but I don't lie about something  like that.  I did go over there.  Lady Di.  Hello?  Hi.  Yeah.  So how long have you been living with roommates?  With a roommate?  Yeah.  About a couple of months.  No, but over the years you've had roommates, right?  Well, my husband, my ex-husband.  Is it true you had roommates when you were working at Budweiser? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  I had one roommate when I was working at Bud.  Oh, you did.  And what happened to that roommate?  I don't know.  Liar.  He stayed here for a couple of weeks.  What?  He stayed here for a couple of weeks and then he left.  And then what happened to him?  I don't know what happened to him.  He left, Opie.  I don't know what happened.  You really don't know what happened to your roommate?  No.  You weren't questioned by anybody about your old roommate.  He took off.  He took off.  You know, after a couple of weeks of living here.  And what happened to him? 
[02:05:00]  I don't know.  He got a job and he just left.  You never had a roommate that might have had something happen to him?  No.  Like what?  What would happen to him over here?  Never questioned by certain authorities?  No.  No, huh?  Well, I never had anybody, you know.  I mean, he just took off.  He just said, okay, I'm going to go.  I got some really good information.  You're sure? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  That you were never in a situation where one of your roommates had something happen to them?  No.  And that you and maybe another roommate were questioned by the authorities?  No.  Not that, you know, you had anything to do with what happened to this person.  But they just questioned you guys to maybe get some background information on this person.  No.  Not at all.  I tend to believe her.  She's so honest all the time. 
[02:06:00]  Well, you know what?  You know what?  She's breathing heavy.  She's breathing heavy.  I don't know what to tell you about that.  But, you know, if there's situations that, you know, I have to get the authorities involved,  which is not really that many.  Not many.  You call the authorities because your current roommate hid your booze on Christmas.  Yeah.  There's something that happened in a blackout that you might not remember.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Now, if people start, I don't care what they fuck around with over here. 
[02:06:30]  Lady Di, here's the deal.  Here is, here's the deal.  But if you're going to fuck around with my property or me or anything like that, which  you only messed around with my property.  Well, he hid your what?  Wine or beer?  He hid my wine.  Who was it?  Jack Lemmon?  I paid four.  And I was pissed.  And this was Christmas Eve, right?  Christmas, actually Christmas night.  Yeah, Christmas night.  She was all drunk.  The roommate decides she's had too much to drink.  She wanted to drink away the bad memories.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  You know, knowing that her own son is somewhere else celebrating Christmas because she's an  unfit mother.  So she figures I'm feeling.  What's that unfit mother stuff already?  She's figuring, you know what?  I need to forget all this stuff.  So I'm going to get really plastered.  And the roommate got involved.  Yeah, the roommate decided she's had enough and hid her wine.  And instead of just thinking, yeah, you know, maybe I've had a little too much to drink  if my roommate is hiding my wine from me.  Maybe Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, whatever it was, shouldn't be spent in an inebriated 
[02:07:30]  plaster on the floor.  And I was not inebriated or plastered.  Oh, stop it.  I just don't like people messing around with my property.  Right, of course.  That's why.  Make that absolutely clear.  So she dials 911.  She calls 9-Fing-1-1 on Christmas Day because the roommate hit her booze, which starts, you  know, one of those episodes of Cops Domestics where she's screaming, it's Christmas.  The cops are laughing because you're just drunk and a mess. 
[02:08:00]  It doesn't matter.  It does matter.  You know, he's still my roommate.  Anybody who's getting drunk, anyone who's getting so drunk on Christmas that they're  calling the police because their roommate hides their booze is really disturbed.  Why would anyone get so hammered as to forget reality?  We already settled this.  It's okay.  We already settled this.  You know, and it ain't going to happen again. 
[02:08:30]  Well, no, because he doesn't live there.  If you take charge of your own life and maybe, if maybe you'd stop this insanity and drinking  and fighting through the greenhouse looking for the bottle, you know, and then maybe things  would turn around.  Maybe, you know, listen to me, stupid.  You know, all the excuses and all this crap, oh, my roommate did this and that.  Well, if you put yourself in that position, if you take control, maybe you wouldn't even  have to worry about it if they're going to hire you at a diner, okay?  Maybe you'd have something else, you know, because, you know, all the fingers you're pointing 
[02:09:00]  at everybody else, they're all coming back at you.  You point one finger, you're pointing three back at yourself.  Thank you.  That was my little thing, you know?  Okay, first of all, it's not a diner that I applied to.  Well, whatever it is.  Whatever it is.  You've got to understand something.  Where is your life headed?  You have no career.  You have no skills.  Yes, I do.  You're looking at a restaurant waitress job that girls take when they get out of high  school or college while they're working on their lives.  This isn't somewhere you end up while you're middle-aged. 
[02:09:30]  What are you going to do with yourself?  You're a mess.  No, I'm not a mess.  You're a mess.  So you're in denial.  You're completely...  No, please stop coming.  Matt from Jersey, the only way Lady Di is going to get tipped as a waitress is if she puts  on a cow suit and falls asleep standing up.  Ah-ha.  So listen.  She's sending in the same joke you sent in the other day.  Oh, really?  No, no, no.  It's the exact same joke that was sent in the other day.  I need to pay more attention.  Listen, I put in also for warehouse jobs.  All right, Lady Di.  I did that.  All right, this isn't the reason why we got you on the phone today. 
[02:10:00]  We're going to play a little game.  If I could prove that you're lying when I'm about to...  When I give you the info, then you are dead to the program.  Oh, come on.  Dead to the program.  Now what's that supposed to mean?  So with that said...  What's that supposed to mean?  Did you ever have a roommate where something happened to him and you guys were questioned?  Yeah.  Ah, now it's yeah. 
[02:10:30]  Now it's yeah.  I got really...  Do you want me to tell you?  Listen, I got really good info.  So we're going to gamble.  Go ahead.  You either tell the story or if you lie about it and we find out that it was true, then you're  dead to us.  What?  We're sick of your lies.  I'm not lying to you.  So instead of me giving the info to the entire country, why don't you tell everyone what  happened to one of your old roommates?  She says, I'm not lying.  Yet she said, no, no, no.  It didn't happen. 
[02:11:00]  It didn't happen.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  And now...  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  The old roommate that I used to have over here...  Right.  ...left.  Okay.  No cops were called.  Nothing.  What happened to him?  He just left.  He got a job and he left.  That's it.  How do you get a job if you died?  No.  No one died over here.  Well, not over there, maybe.  No, no, no.  No one died, period.  You never had...  Over here that I know of.  You never had a roommate that died? 
[02:11:30]  No.  And the police came over to question you and maybe somebody else?  No.  I got to find the email and talk to...  All right.  Di, you know that if we do find out that you're lying, you will never again be on the show  and we are completely serious about it.  Oh, will you stop already with that?  No, I'm not lying to you.  Never a roommate when you were working maybe at Budweiser?  Okay.  Yeah?  Did you have a roommate when you worked at Budweiser? 
[02:12:00]  No.  No.  I mean, I had a boyfriend, but I never had a roommate.  A boyfriend?  Well, you know, my son's father.  But, you know, you really couldn't consider him a roommate.  I don't know how you can consider him a boyfriend.  But I don't know what to tell you about that.  How about the guy that died?  What guy that died?  I don't have the email in front of me, unfortunately, because I'm an idiot and I deleted all my mail. 
[02:12:30]  But the guy's a faithfulist in the show.  I'm sure he'll send it back again.  And I know who he was.  But it was some guy that worked with you at the Budweiser plant that wrote me and says he swears that you had a roommate that ended up dying and there was you and another roommate that was questioned.  Bullshit.  Not questioned as in you had something to do with his passing, but they definitely, you know, questioned you guys because you guys were all living together. 
[02:13:00]  No.  No.  No.  Wrong.  Wrong.  You know, I don't know who this person is that used to work with me, but no.  Well, that is not true.  Well, if we find out that it is true.  Well, you can find out whatever you want, but that's not true.  We will have no more use for you.  I never had two roommates anyway living here at the same time.  Huh?  I never had two roommates over here.  How long have you been where you are right now?  I've been here 10 years.  10 years?  How about a transient you just picked up to stay at your house? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, maybe you were both drunk together.  I've been here for 10 years.  Before that, I lived in Elizabeth.  You know, you were sitting next to Faye Dunaway.  No, I've been here for 10 years.  Been here 10 years.  I'm a drunk, man.  Originally, I was married and my husband was living here.  My ex-husband was living here.  No, there's something going on.  There's definitely something going on.  Oh, shoot.  I just hung up.  What an idiot.  Good.  Glenn from New Hyde Park.  Hey, guys.  This fat slob two seconds ago said she had a roommate when she worked at Budweiser, 
[02:14:00]  and now she says she didn't.  She lies like it's a constant barrage of lies.  I can't stand it.  I hate her.  She's an awful, awful human being, and I hope she dies.  Punch it up.  Just call her Lady Lie.  It's not Lady Die.  Lady Lie.  Well, all right.  We'll get to the bottom of it.  This guy swears it's true.  We'll do our research.  On Ray.  I just woke up to this again. 
[02:14:30]  Every morning, I hear your stupid voice.  She's gone.  Oh, no, wait.  She's back.  Hold on.  She should be gone.  Hold on.  We'll put her on with you.  Hold on.  Please.  Go ahead.  Because today she cried.  Lady Lie.  Yes.  What happened?  We got cut off.  Oh, yeah.  Cut off.  Cut your head off.  The phone probably got cut off.  No, no, no.  First of all, I never had two roommates live.  All three of us live together.  I never had that.  I never did that.  That's why.  They wouldn't want to live under the same roof as you. 
[02:15:00]  What?  My God, man.  Did you know someone that got?  Fred's brother again?  Yes.  This is stupid.  She's so stupid.  Why do you keep calling?  Diane, why do you call?  I don't like him.  Diane, why do you call this show?  Because I want to call this show.  Why do you call this show?  No one wants to hear from you.  No one wants to hear from you.  Just like your son.  They don't want to mean to hear you.  Excuse me.  Don't bring up my son anymore.  Your son.  How old is your son, Diane?  He's 14 years old.  Leave him alone.  No, he's not coming home to you.  And that's the best idea for him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You got a Puerto Rican saying that? 
[02:15:30]  You were absolutely wrong.  He's never coming home to you.  You understand that?  He will be back here.  He is no good at your house.  Oh, that's so sad.  Because you will beat him.  What?  And you will get drunk.  Are you...  Oh, get off the phone.  You understand?  What's wrong with you?  Do you have any kids?  You probably sell him on the black market for money for booze.  No, I wouldn't...  What?  Oh, come on.  He ain't strong with my son.  You are an unfit, horrible mother.  14 years old.  Leave him alone.  Had enough bombs a better mother than you. 
[02:16:00]  You know what I'm saying?  No, stop.  And that's the truth.  Stop it already.  You are a terrible mother and he will never...  Stop it.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Because you will sell him for booze.  You will trade him on the street.  I will...  No, I would not do that.  Yes, you will because you are drunk and you don't know any better.  And you better not tell Mary that, too, because she's going to go right down your throat.  What is she fucking babbling about?  You're a stupid idiot.  Because you know why?  You know why?  Because...  Are you there?  No, he doesn't need to be...  He hung up on you.  Yeah, he was done with you. 
[02:16:30]  I'm glad he hung up on me.  He did a great job.  He made a great point about selling your son on the street for booze.  What?  That is Mary's godson.  So?  Okay, so...  And you think she's honestly proud?  Of course she's proud to be her godmother.  His godmother.  What do you do all...  Like, what's a day consist of when you don't work and you don't do anything?  Just glug, glug, glug.  What does a day consist of?  Yeah, I mean, like...  Listen here.  Listen to me.  Shut up, Wafflehead.  You fill out one dumb application.  No, no, no.  Don't fill out a bunch of applications. 
[02:17:00]  Get a paper route.  Do something.  All right, well, we're going to...  It's a story that's in progress.  We'll find out about this.  I'm going to find out more info.  Go ahead.  You should make her go to 90 meetings to get back on it.  She's got to do something positive.  No, we tried.  We had a guy that was willing to get her in the program and walk her through it, and she  blew him off already.  So that's why I have no sympathy for her at all.  I probably have him on the phone right now.  At all.  How old...  You can't ask how old you are, but when you graduated high school, who was the president? 
[02:17:30]  Who was the president?  I mean, how old are you?  She's about 40.  I think Ronald Reagan.  Ugh.  All right.  Lady Di...  I think it was Ronald Reagan.  I'm not, you know...  Lady Di, we're done with you, okay?  Done.  Aw.  See?  One last chance.  Did you or did you not have a roommate that died?  No.  I did not have a roommate that passed away.  All right, liar.  What do you mean, all right, liar?  All right, liar.  I'm not kidding.  Keep lying.  Thank you.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  All right, there's Lady Di.  There she goes.  Lady Di.  This guy swears it's true. 
[02:18:00]  Worked with her at Budweiser.  I would believe some guy, I have no clue who it is, sending an email quicker than I would  believe anything that comes out of her fat yaw.  There's a story there.  How sad is that life?  I mean, this guy that died upstairs from my mother's house, did I ever tell you this  in the bag?  He was spanking it in the bag, and he put a plastic bag over himself.  Why are people still freaking doing that?  He spanked it and passed out in the bag and died. 
[02:18:30]  Auto-erotic asphyxiation.  But the good thing is a coroner, I mean, it's good for a coroner, you just come pick up the  plastic bag and take him out.  You know what I mean?  So what?  He just...  They found, they didn't know where he was, and then, you know...  I think that's how Paul Lynn died, too, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because I went on the death tour in L.A., and I think that's how he died.  Paul Lynn?  Yeah.  Putting the bag over his head?  Yeah, well, yeah.  He was center bag.  As he was whacking off or something.  I'm not positive, but I think I remember something like that.  But don't you have somebody with you?  Shouldn't you get somebody with you to, you know, take the bag off you? 
[02:19:00]  If you had someone with you, you wouldn't be jerking off.  You just kind of...  Or what was the guy from In Excess?  Like, put a belt around his neck, put it on a doorknob, and kind of put his weight on  his neck, and was cranking himself.  But then he must have passed out.  And now he's hanging.  You know, can't you just jack off?  I know.  What the hell is wrong with people that...  You know, maybe use a finger or two when you're...  Whatever.  Just...  What's wrong with just grabbing your right hand, grabbing hold, and cranking away? 
[02:19:30]  What do you need to choke yourself, put a bag over your head, bring in all kinds of  toys?  All right.  Here's what I want...  I want you to smash me with this two-by-four as I'm jacking off.  Just get it over with.  I remember years ago, when you first get the internet, years ago, and you find pornography,  pornography, and I would troll for hours, looking at smut, for hours, and just spend time, 
[02:20:00]  you know, jacking and looking at the pictures and stuff.  And then when you finish, you're like, I wasted, like, so much time.  I should have just finished up, like, hours ago.  And you wind up wasting stuff.  Just grab hold.  And just jack.  Give a few times.  Get it over with.  So you can move on with your life.  Move on.  Do something.  Go fill out some job application.  Get your son back.  You make a really good point.  Sometimes you just spend much too much time and energy jacking. 
[02:20:30]  My friend would take the government blocks of cheese, and he'd put a hole in it, and  he'd put it in a microwave and warm it a little.  And then he'd bag the government blocks.  Warm.  Warm cheese.  Yeah.  But he was a heroin addict, so he went to pawn the microwave, and he didn't realize  that he left the government cheese with a hole in it.  Stop.  I'm not lying.  If I'd call him right now, you can ask him, Joe.  Did you have a roommate that died once?  No.  Upstairs, the guy died.  No, I know.  All right.  Well, Anthony, we got some propaganda audio.  Yes.  This was the stuff to rally the troops, rally the nation. 
[02:21:00]  Back in the older days.  It was heard on regular radio.  Back when they smoked Luckies.  That was a really funny bit yesterday.  So the first song we're going to hear is Remember Pearl Harbor, better known as Wipe the Jap  from the Mat.  Can you imagine if we did this today?  The outrage that would be out there?  Why can't we put out an Iraqi song where we sing about how we got to kill the towel heads? 
[02:21:30]  Because these were popular songs.  These weren't just niche things that were recorded that people were like, oh, that's awful.  This rallied the nation.  There's one from the Andrews sisters.  See?  Very popular.  Didn't get much bigger than that back in the day.  And they have a song called You're a Sap, Mr. Jap.  So many things rhymed with Jap back then.  So easy to write a song.  You're a sap, Mr. Jap.  All right.  So let's listen to just a piece of Remember Pearl Harbor, Wipe the Jap from the Mat. 
[02:22:00]  Remember Pearl Harbor  When you sight down the bell of your gun  Remember Pearl Harbor  Never stop till you drop every one  Give them bomb for bombs 
[02:22:30]  Give them shell for shell  Fill a hundred rats for every boy that fell  Remember Pearl Harbor  Wipe the Jap from the Mat  Give them hell  Brush, brush, brush your teeth  Brush, oh, sorry, it sounded like that  Down on the white blue sea  Hawaii Isle of sunshine 
[02:23:00]  Lay so peacefully  Then from the sky without warning  The vultures want to attack  Hiding behind their peace talk  They stabbed our boys in the black  Remember Pearl Harbor  Every hour, every day that we live  Remember Pearl Harbor 
[02:23:30]  And the crime we can never forgive  Through the sweat and toil  Through the blood and tears  Keep this battle cry  Keep this battle cry  Winging in our ears  Remember Pearl Harbor  Let the sun take us strong  Through the years  All right, enough of that  Remember Hiroshima  Yeah, I think we won in the end  I think I know how that turns out 
[02:24:00]  I think we persevere and remember Pearl Harbor  And barbecue a couple hundred thousand of them  A little more than that  A little more than that  So it's just amazing  I mean, if you had these type of songs today  All the outrage  I know  You should do that  All right, the next one  Stupid insurgents  What rhymes with insurgents?  Maybe that's why there's no songs  Give the enemy stupid names now  You can't  How the hell are you going to do that?  The next one, just a piece  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap 
[02:24:30]  We're going to have to slap the dirty little Jap?  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it  Of course he is  Written by Bob Miller  Performed by Carson Robinson  By Carson Rob  Typo, hopefully  Who wrote slap the little Jap?  Ed Norton?  They were good  I remember they opened  We're going to have to slap  The dirty little Jap 
[02:25:00]  And Uncle Sam's the guy who can do it  Yeah  We'll skin that streak of yellow  From the sneaky little fella  And he'll think the cyclone struck him  When we're through it  We'll take that double crosser  To the old woodshed  We'll start right on his bottom  And we'll go to his head  When we get done with him  He'll wish that he was dead  We've got to slap the dirty little Jap  Uncle Sam's a man  Who's given a helping hand 
[02:25:30]  To many a foreign land  Don't forget it  But when somebody goes  To tromping on his toes  They'd better guard their nose  Or they'll regret it  We're going to have to slap  The dirty little Jap  And Uncle Sam's the guy  Who can do it  The Japs and all their hooey  Will be changed into chop suey  And the rising sun will set  When we get through it  Their alibi for fighting  Is to save their face  For ancestors waiting  In celestial space 
[02:26:00]  We'll kick their precious face  Down to the other place  We've got to slap  The dirty little Jap  Goddamn Japs  You want to go out  And get him now  We're going to have to slap  The dirty little Jap  And Uncle Sam's the guy  Who can do it  Yes sir  I wouldn't fool you mister  He can raise an awful blister  And somebody's pants will burn  Before we're through it  We'll reach across the ocean 
[02:26:30]  And grab that yellow Jap  And turn him upside down  Right on democracy's lap  We'll blister his axis  And do it with a snap  We've got to slap  The dirty little Jap  Uncle Sam is mild  As peaceful as a child  But never get me wild  Or you will rue it  So now they want to fight  Well they bit off quite a bite  And Uncle Sam  Is going to make them chew it  We're going to have to slap  The dirty little Jap 
[02:27:00]  And Uncle Sam's the guy  Who can do it  Alright you get the idea there  It goes on forever  Of course it does  I smell bit Anthony  I smell bit  Yeah  I think the listeners  Are talented enough  To come up with some  Current propaganda songs  Ah  A little few titles for Iraq  Yeah  We're going to have to  Cracky the dirty little Iraqi  But you have to have it sung in this fun loving way  Of course it's fun  Like they did back in the day  Back then they could dance to that  Lovely  I just  I just 
[02:27:30]  I don't know  I just loved it when we were all just openly racist  Yeah  Because we weren't even trying to hide it back then  Who are you kidding  We're all racist  Every single person that listens to this program has racism in their blood  I don't care if you're a black guy listening  A white guy  A trucker  A mom  A dirty little Jap  Or even a dirty little Jap  We are all racist  The problem is that we just make believe we're not nowadays  Back then it was open 
[02:28:00]  Ah people didn't care  Man I used to hang out at the Legion with my dad when he was alive  And man these guys would just trash each other  Of course  There was a Jewish guy there  A black guy there  A Polish guy  An Irish guy  An Italian  And these guys would just go at each other's throats  They all walked into a bar  Yeah they had the best racist jokes that they just would pound each other with  Yep  Pound each other  And my dad explained  This is just how it was when he was growing up  Yeah  The good old days when the Klan just hated colors  Remember that  They expanded  I remember 
[02:28:30]  What  See that's  But that's the problem  Oh  The bell is the problem  But back then no one hid behind political correctness  Everyone was just openly racist  Even in war now  You can't be racist  Which is hysterical  You're over there  You're killing people  Which is good  But you should at least  You know  Be allowed to  To write little ditties like this  Yeah  They did it back then  You know  The Japs came over  And bombed Pearl Harbor  And they wrote some songs about it  And you know 
[02:29:00]  It wasn't like  That nice little Asian gentleman  Needs a talking to  Right  No it was you know  Gotta slap the dirty little Jap  Well we have to be careful with the coverage  We were talking about this a while ago  But it was brought up on TV the other day  Another suicide bomber  Yes  They had a big story about another suicide bomber  And no it's called a  Yeah  Homicide bomber is what Fox News calls them  No  Are you serious?  Because they don't want to  Freedom fighters  They don't want to put the focus on the bomber  They want to put the focus on the people that were killed 
[02:29:30]  So instead of calling it a suicide bomber  They call it a homicide bomber  But meanwhile  Any bombing that kills someone  Is a homicide bombing  Whether the guy plants the bomb  And runs away  Or straps it to his body and dies  The thing that separates it  Is the fact that the suicide bomber  Is blowing himself up  So a homicide bombing means nothing  Right  A roadside bombing is a homicide bombing  If it kills somebody  Yeah  Fox News  Trying to be politically correct  Trying to alter your viewpoint a little bit 
[02:30:00]  They don't call  They don't call marine snipers  Snipers  On Fox News  They're called sharpshooters  They're called sharpshooters  Yeah  Because sniper  Has bad  Stigma to it  And they don't call them terrorists  They call them freedom fighters  Or something  Some of them do  But maybe Al Jazeera  Who calls them freedom fighters  I don't know  They don't call them terrorists  They call them  Something  I'll get back to you on that  Get back to me on that one  Ugh  You know you go in the airport  You get checked by

[02:34:30]  The Opie and Anthony  Program  On XM Satellite Radio  The ONA virus  Spreading across America  Changing subjects  Just a little bit  For a few minutes  Here Anthony  Yeah then we'll get back  To our  Propaganda songs  Propaganda  Because people coming up  With all sorts of songs  That we should be playing  Yes  A lot of people mentioning  Some of the John Valby songs  About Osama and Iraq  And Saddam  Right  Terrorism  We say bring back 
[02:35:00]  The propaganda songs  Love them  But first let's go to the phones  And say hi to Mark Patrick  Mark what's up  Trying to figure out  What rhymes with Fox Pearl  You know it's like orange  I don't think there's anything  That rhymes with Fox Pearl  No Fox Pearl  No  I can't do a propaganda song  About that  I guess we could start  With the Pats  Because our own Ben Sparks  Who's the producer  Of our radio show  Is a huge Pats fan  They're favored over the Colts 
[02:35:30]  And I don't know  I don't mean to add  To the propaganda  But I just learned  Through NFL security sources  That Ben and Ricky Williams  Have been planting weed  Yeah  Between the hash marks  The hash marks  The field's going to be  A mess anyway  Well they haven't  Covered the field  Yeah well what is this  About now  They're cheating  They're not cheating  They deserve the right  They won 14 games  Ben explain this  Really fast  What are they doing 
[02:36:00]  Up there in Fox Pearl  They let the field  They didn't cover the field  So it rained on the field  It rained on the field  So now it's going to be muddy  And why would the Pats  Want this  Because they tend to play better  And Manning doesn't  Tend to play well  In this condition  In the mud  Aren't they growing potatoes Ben  Yeah I don't know  I don't know  They want to feed the fans  Yeah  They want to help out  The tsunami victims  Yeah they decided  To start growing rice  Up there in Foxboro  That's what Foxboro looks like  It looks like a tsunami  There are cars being pushed  Across the end zone  Big trees  Bodies on the field 
[02:36:30]  Do you guys remember  In 82  When Ron Meyer  Who was just this side  Of being the coach  In the longest yard  They were lining up  A field goal attempt  To win the game  Against Miami  And it was snowing  Like crazy  And he had the guy  Come out  With the snowblower  With the snowblower  With the snowblower  With the snowblower  With the snowblower  With the snowblower  With the snowblower  Yeah the guy was  Work release  He was just out of prison  And what  He was the one  That plowed the field  Yeah he came out  With a little snowblower  And made a little path  Right to the ball  It was one of those 
[02:37:00]  Giant round brooms  Yeah  He just ran across it  Like some big dummy  Yeah no one told him  He just did it on his own  Well Ron Meyer  Yeah probably  Yeah right  But this doesn't seem  Very legal  Or at least  Very ethical  The NFL  Inspected the field  And they said  It's okay  They did  I just read that  Online a little while ago  You know this is  Going to backfire  Of course  All the things  Like this always backfire  Manning's going to  Have the game of his  Career now  Because of this  You know that's 
[02:37:30]  What happens  In these situations  You know  They've got everything  Going  I mean New England  Has everything going  In their direction  Though  To start that game  At 4.30  On a Sunday afternoon  Even if it's balmy  By the time it's 4.30  It's going to be  Cold  It's going to be cold  That's right  And then you're going  To have that  Mud ice combo  There's nothing  There's nothing  More miserable  Than a wet  Wet  Cold field  You're better off  To have it frozen  And snowing  Than you are wet  And cold  I think  Yeah 
[02:38:00]  You think the  Pats are going  All the way this year  No  It's the Steelers  Right bro  No I really think  It's the Colts  You think the Colts  Are going to  Get the job done  A lot of people  Think the Colts  Are going to win  The whole thing  If they get past  This game  I mean this is  Their water  They just can't  Beat New England  I think they've  They've only  They've won twice  In the last 15 times  They've seen New England  And Peyton Manning  Has got some kind  Of weird  Psychological  Thing to overcome 
[02:38:30]  In this game  But if  If all of that  You know  Saying all of that  They've really lost  The last two times  They've played them  In Foxborough  Just because of  Turnovers  So if they can  Stop that  I think they're  A better team  Because New England  Secondary is just  Beat up right now  Yeah we're missing  Ty Law  And Poole  So yeah  But you know  We'll see what happens  Oh he's making  The excuses  I'm not making  The excuses  I get all  Like a typical  Boston fan  I love these  Boston fans  Ben is doing  What I think  Colts fans are doing  With the field thing  You know 
[02:39:00]  Yeah  Everybody's setting up  An excuse  Just in case it happens  All right  How about my Jets  Oh boy  Come on Mark  That's a tough  Come on Mark  Help me out  How about the Jets  Do you own the Jets  I know  Don't you love  How people do that  Don't you love  When for example  When they beat San Diego  They became my Jets  Oh yeah I know  I understand  And had they lost  It were those damn Jets  We do make fun of that  Like when  When the Red Sox  Won the World Series  Everyone was calling  Ben congratulating him  Like he had something  To do with it  Yeah  And Ben just said 
[02:39:30]  Just now  He's talking about  Injuries to the team  He goes  Well  We lost  We  Yeah we lost  We lost  That's true  I did say  We us  We do get carried away  With our rooting  Thinking that we really  Do have something  To do with it  But if Pittsburgh  Well you're known  As Leon Hess  For most of the  Most of the time  It's just  You know  Your radio name  Right  If Pittsburgh  Takes out Pennington  They don't have  A backup quarterback  I mean who's  Because Quincy Carter  Is not even going  To be with the team  Yeah what's going on  With all that Mark  Well Quincy Carter  Is his mom 
[02:40:00]  Is ailing  But they think  He'll be back  For the game  But you know  Pennington will be  Ready for the game  He doesn't have  The squirts anymore  Right  Yeah he had  The flu all week  Right he had  The flu  Diarrhea  Diarrhea  Diarrhea  Stomachache  Maybe Belichick  Could fly him up  To Foxborough  And let him  Have a little  Diarrhea action  On the field  To mix it  With the mud  That would help  The goal  I have seen  The goal  I have seen NFL games 
[02:40:30]  Where guys have  Had the squirts  And they're playing  On an artificial surface  So it's like  There's no way  That they can say  Well I've been  You know I sat down  In a puddle  It's mud  Yeah  You see it coming  Right through the  Uniform sometimes  Oh yeah  I've seen guys  I've seen guys  Because in the NFL  They just wear  A jock  Yeah  And that's it  A lot of those guys  Well the majority  Wear no hip pads  Or  Or  Tailbone pads  At all  So they just wear 
[02:41:00]  A jock  And on those  Really fat linemen  It's not a good  Sight up close  Who'd want to  Cover somebody  And really get  Close to them  If  Well there's  Well I think  There's me  And  Well there's always  Been stories of  These guys that  Decide not to shower  For a whole week  And make sure  Their breath is  Really bad  Just to you know  Throw off their  Opponents  On the lock here  Huh?  Tragically that's true  Yeah  The thing is  They also have to  Ride like team 
[02:41:30]  Planes and buses  Which you know  Really makes guys  Want to sit next to  Them on those trips  So  So quickly  What do you think  Jet Steelers  Steelers?  Yeah  I just think  That home field  Advantage is going  To be too much  Although the Jets  Gave Ben Roethlisberger  Fitz first time  They got together  But I just think  The running game  With the Steelers  Playing at home  Probably too much  But the Jets  Kind of  They kind of  Struck me as  One of those  Teams that  For whatever  Reason 
[02:42:00]  When it comes  To playoff time  Have  Kind of got  Some sort of  Edge working for  Yeah that is weird  On paper  It's kind of  Inexplicable  Like you're not  Supposed to go to  San Diego and win  Right  Right  You're not supposed  To go to  Pittsburgh and win  Right  Yeah on paper  It just doesn't  Make sense  They should lose  But then they have  That weird thing  Going on where  You can't count them out  It reminds me of the  Falcons a few years ago  When they went to  The Super Bowl  And  Yeah  You know 
[02:42:30]  We have the Falcons  At the Super Bowl  And I'm sitting here  Wait  What did the show  Cut off at 10 o'clock  Again  Well no I mean  If you guys remember  I mean they  They win  Nobody thought  They were going to  Win the first round  They went up  And they won  In Minnesota  To win the  NFC championship game  And Gary Anderson  Missed the only  Field goal he'd missed  All year long  For Minnesota  And all of a sudden  The Falcons  Were in the  Freaking Super Bowl  And then everyone  Then they got smoked  And everybody goes  Well how'd they get here  Yeah exactly  Who killed them that year 
[02:43:00]  In the Super Bowl  In the Super Bowl  Yeah who was that  That year  Was it Denver  St. Louis  No Denver  That was Denver  Yeah I think it was  Denver's second time  Right  You notice how  Knowledgeable we are Mark  Yeah  We faked it pretty good  On that one  Didn't we  Not exactly  Mike and the Mad Dog  So Calvin Hill  Is playing with who now  Yeah we're just  We're just trying to get  A quick football wrap  This is a sports program  We're all like  Yeah we'll go with that  The Falcons  Sure  But how about that though 
[02:43:30]  If we went back  If we go back  It's easier to remember  Like I can tell you  The starting lineup  For every major league team  In 1969  Wow  But I can hardly tell you today  Because of the way guys are  Same with football players  You mentioned Calvin Hill  Because you can hear  Howard Cosell  Saying all of them  Can't you  Hello again everyone  With the diminutive  O.P.  And it  An incredible 
[02:44:00]  Consolidation of talent  On XM radio  That's pretty good  That's real good  Calvin Hill  Whose son of course  Grant can barely  Keep himself alive  Much less in the lineup  For the magic of Orlando  The matchup  Going to do it all day  Of course  Grant  Falcon  Saturday  8 o'clock  It's not on ABC 
[02:44:30]  Thankfully  So we won't have to put up with  One Joe Theismann  That's very good man  That's a game that nobody cares about  The Saturday night  I was just about to say  And the who cares game  Yeah St. Louis and Atlanta  Atlanta's favorite  Whatever  Yeah  I don't know  I mean Michael Vick  I hate to be  A cliche guy  But it's all going to be  Michael Vick  Right  There you have it  If they stop him  They've stopped the Falcons  And I don't 
[02:45:00]  I want to  I hope  Gee I hope Fox gets  Some cutaway shots  Of Mike Martz  On the sideline  I don't think we get  Quite enough  He's a genius  That coach  Unbelievable  And then the other  NFC game  Is the Vikings  And Eagles  Yeah  Eagles favored  And the big news there  Is also Fox  Because  Red McCombs  The owner of Vikings  Doesn't want Joe Buck  Working the game  Did you see that  Yes I did  Wow  Really  The whole Randy Moss  And Joe Buck thing  That happened last week  I thought it was hilarious 
[02:45:30]  You want to explain  Basically Randy Moss  They're saying it was a mooning  But now they're saying  It was actually him mooning  And making believe  He was taking a crap  In the end zone  You know the crap part  I don't know  Maybe that was in honor  Of J. Davenport  To the Packers  Who actually did that  In a hamper  To a girl  At a college  Lovely  But I don't care  What Randy Moss  Did in the end zone  I was mesmerized  By the post game interviews  Have you seen any of those 
[02:46:00]  Yes  I just sat there  Looking at his hair  Yeah  I just couldn't get  And he had his  He wasn't paying attention  To who was interviewing him  So he was bent down  Like messing with his socks  Or his shoes or something  And he's naked  At least from the waist up  But his hair  Is the only thing  You see in the picture  And I just kept waiting  For him to pop up  And say  But we want  I mean he looked like  Eddie Murphy  Yeah  I just said to 
[02:46:30]  O-Tay  Cold Peppa  Throw  But we  The ball  Wow  Wow  Yeah  I mean  I  You know  So that's what  I was  I couldn't believe  His hair  So I  I don't know  I think he  I think his whole thing  Was pretty tame  In the end zone  But it all comes down  To  Whether his ankle  Is relatively healthy 
[02:47:00]  In the game  But Joe Buck  Was pretty much  Outraged  By the whole thing  And he's the guy  Doing those commercials  Goofing on  Players like  Randy Moss  Yeah  Yeah but see  It's all about  The history  You know  If you had  Brett Favre  Go in the end zone  And do that  In Minnesota  Is anybody  Going to say anything  No  Nah it's Brett Favre  Well it's because  He's white  And you know  He's picking his  Boy  Who cares  You know  I like when  I like when  These guys showboat 
[02:47:30]  It just makes it  A little more fun  As you're at home  Watching this stuff  A little more interesting  A little more fun  Sure  You know  I don't know man  I think the NFL  Is just so uptight  They don't like the dancing  And the spite  You know  They just don't like  All that stuff  I love it  The celebrations  I don't know  I guess I'm old school  I think that  I like the celebration  But I think there's  A certain limit  I mean when it's  So contrived  Like all of  Terrell Irwin's stuff  And when he goes out  And dances on the star  At Cowboy Stadium 
[02:48:00]  And stuff like that  Yeah that's a bit much  And we got Joe Horn  On a cell phone  If it's a real  Exuberant show  Of celebration  I don't have a problem  With that  I used to like the  I used to like the  Gastineau sack dance  Where he'd jump up and down  And beat his girlfriend  Yeah when he'd  Stick his foot in  Brigitte Nielsen  You know  No you're right  That's a sack dance  Have you seen her  Lately  What a mess  Oh god  She went from 
[02:48:30]  That time is a bitch  Huh  I'll tell you what  When Howie Long  Looks better than she does  She was a super babe  Back in the day  You know  She was one of those  Real tall blonde  Just Amazon  Hot chicks  And now she's just  This old hag  And now she's  Banging Flavor Flav  Banging Flavor Flav  I mean you can't tell me  That that silicone  Doesn't ooze out  And cause some kind of  Aging problem  Yeah 
[02:49:00]  Along the line  Yeah see  She didn't hold up  Too well  At all  But  Alright  Alright man  Hey Mark  Thank you so much  For helping us out  With our football coverage  Oh I think now  That we've got it all  Decided what's gonna happen  I would imagine now  They won't even play the game  Cause we know  There's really no need to  Now that  My Jets  And my Patriots  Have been taken care of  In this room  Yeah we got it in the bag  Alright so  You're going with  The Steelers  You're going with  Atlanta  You're going with 
[02:49:30]  Philly  Yes  The Eagles over Minnesota  And the Colts over New England  Yes  Very nice  Alright we'll remember  Anything you want to plug  Well don't forget  That MLB's  New network  Starts on XM  Sometime first week  Of February we think  Yeah that's gonna be  A lot of fun  A lot of fun  To check out  Any of the  XM MLB staff  Be on steroids  Well as a matter of fact  We have  Steroid testing  Not like the new 
[02:50:00]  Steroid testing policy  In Major League Baseball  But we have to be on them  Yeah that went  That went down today  Actually  The new steroid policy  In Major League Baseball  His bed  Sea Lake  Has been very  Very  Demonstrative  You know  Doesn't that kind of  Kind of get you  When you know  You see this  Get tough policy  Right  And the guy  That comes out  And announces it  Sounds like droopy dogs  A little worm  Yeah  We're getting tougher  And people like 
[02:50:30]  Barry Bonds  And Jason Giambi  No more steroids  Oh that's great  Yeah  One thing I found out  Though  They're not going to test  Or they don't do anything  For amphetamines  In baseball  Isn't that odd  A little odd  Yeah  I'm always amazed  That the things  That are against the law  Aren't tested for  Yeah  Yeah  No problem  If you want to  You know  Snort up some crystal meth  And go out there  And whack a few  At the wall  But I think we're going to see 
[02:51:00]  Some home run records  I mean I think we've seen  The last of a lot of these  Home run records  These big guys  Are just not big anymore  I think Barry Bonds  Is going to lead  The league next year  With 28 homers  28  We're going back  To the old days now  Because Anthony and I  We talked about this  A couple weeks ago  These guys are running scared  And some of these guys  Are popping up on TV  And they look  They look a lot smaller already  Emaciated  Well I'll tell you  What the interesting thing  Was with the human growth hormone  Which was the  You know everybody  Just says steroids  But it was really  This human growth hormone  Yeah  What it did 
[02:51:30]  Was make their heads huge  Is that it  Seriously  Yes  Some of these guys  Barry Bonds went from  There used to be  I know guys that work  At New Era  The hat company  That provides all the hats  For Major League Baseball  Yeah  Ten years ago  There was one player  In the big leagues  That had a hat size  Of eight  And it was Bruce Boshi  Who's the manager  Of the Padres  He just naturally  Had a hat  A head  That they used to run  NASCAR races around 
[02:52:00]  I mean it was big  Zimmer's hat wasn't  That big  Who  The Zim  Oh no  Zim's hat's gotta be giant  It's got a plate in it  That's keeping his  Standard seven and a half  That huge pumpkin head  So now all these guys  Have big heads  But now yeah  Last year there was  Something like 48 guys  That had over a size eight  That just doesn't happen  I've never heard that  Yeah  That little bit of that stat  That's a baseball stat  We haven't seen

Yeah, well  I had no clue  Who's a better agent?  Because neither of us  Makes $20 million a movie  Yeah  Yeah, they're not following you around  Wondering when you're going to have a kid  Yeah  Following you on vacation  None of that  No, that's my mom's job  Yeah  Have you ever had the paparazzi in your face?  Very, very little  I mean, only when I call them 
[03:16:30]  And, uh  Please snap off some  We, um  I'm proud to say  Anthony and I  Had them follow us around for a while  And it's a very strange experience  Yeah  I remember you guys went through a tough time there  When  The skirt  What does everyone know about us?  Come on  What are you going to do?  I mean, you know  I live  I live in America  Dude, we, uh  We had  Well, I could talk for myself  Because Anthony was living in an apartment  So it was a little different for him  But I was in  I was renting in the top half of a house  On Long Island  And the photographers 
[03:17:00]  Camped outside my house for a week  Oh  With lawn chairs  And these huge telescopic lenses  They were jumping out of the bushes  When I was coming back from the grocery store  It's crazy, right?  It was insane  One day  It's a true story  I just want to leave my house  I couldn't figure out how to do it  Because they had all the angles covered  So they  They even weren't  They weren't sure if there was a  Um, uh, uh  An exit at the back of the house  Maybe stairs that, you know  Went outside  So  But they  They had the angles  Just in case that I left from the back 
[03:17:30]  Yeah  So what I had to do  And this is a true story  I  I learned this from TV  I  I tied a bunch of sheets together  From TV  And I actually  Shimmyed down my  No way  From the second floor  I had my brother  Take my car  And park it in a parking lot  Because they saw the car in the driveway  So he just casually  Walked to my house  Jumped in my car and left  And I  I shimmied down the  The sheets  They were left hanging in the wind  And jumped over my neighbor's fence  And got my car and left for the day  And those  Those idiots  Stayed there all day  Waiting 
[03:18:00]  It would have been easier  To get Steve McQueen in tunnel  I know  One day  I just watched them  Watch me all day long  I thought it was the most fascinating thing  I was just peeking through the blinds  And I saw them looking at their watches  And getting on their cell phone  Giving updates to the papers  Or whoever they were working for  And then they would get like  Deli orders  And you know  Yeah you want coffee  You can even read their lips  Like you want coffee  Yeah you want a sandwich  Okay  Because they needed that shot  Of the scourge of society  And they never  I mean  I'm proud to say  They never got it  Because it was a game  I started playing with them  But  But you know  You know what's so nuts too 
[03:18:30]  Is like  I know like  You read the newspapers  Or the magazines  And you're like  You see these actors  And you're like  Oh this guy's a douche  Or whatever  And then you know  This past summer  I worked with Jennifer Lopez  On this movie  And these guys  They went crazy  Like I mean  She couldn't go 10 feet  They're shoving the camera  Under the fence and stuff  And I got it  When I saw it from the other side  I was like  You know what  That's no way to live man  That really sucks for her  In a lot of ways  You know  I don't think a lot of people  Realize how incredibly intrusive it is  But I think  A lot of these actors  Also will set up 
[03:19:00]  Go out to certain places  To have the people  Come shoot them  I would do that  I have no problem with it  I think unfortunately  When you get up to that status  It just comes with the territory  You know  They want those people  In their faces  When they're promoting something  That they believe  You know  So it's  It's a tough one  You know  You can't just tell them  To turn it off  Right  Yeah  You're right  I mean  By the way  We got a famous TV star  In the studio  With us today  Yeah please  Will  Did you watch  Last Comic Standing  Yeah  Oh you did 
[03:19:30]  We have Rich Voss  In the studio  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  He was the guy  If you watch the show  That did a lot of ironing  Season one  And smoking cigarettes  And ironing  Was pretty much  Season one  And season three  He was called  The Don  Yeah Rich  How's it going  How are you  How are you  Good great  Things are cool  Very funny  Oh thank you  Matter of fact  When Rich was doing his thing  All the rag magazines  Were finding all sorts of  Old stories about you  Yeah I was in the inquire 
[03:20:00]  And all kinds of stuff  They were digging up  Old stories  What was the one  We were laughing  Because we  Will we've known Rich  For I don't know  Five six years now  You know  And when he made it big  It was fun for all of us  I'm not going to lie  We trash him and stuff  But it was a lot of fun  And then we're reading about him  In the inquire and stuff  And it was just  I don't know  What was the story  Like  When I used to do drugs  I guess going from drugs  To sobriety or something  Yeah  I didn't tell  Whatever the story was  Awful story  I don't know  Whatever story  They had a picture of me  Doing comedy  In somebody's living room 
[03:20:30]  I do a private party  You know  I mean  I did  I did  I did a show  In some ladies living room  To you know  Sixteen year olds  For crack money  Yeah pretty much  For crack money  Will one of the greatest moments  You know  I mean  When we met Rich  Doing well locally and stuff  And then he gets up  To this huge  I mean huge  And I'm at the  Montreal Comedy Festival  With a bunch of the guys  That do our radio show  And these fat women  Come walking up to us  It was me  Norton  And Voss  And they obviously  Wanted a picture  Okay 
[03:21:00]  Yeah  So they get all crazy  Like oh my god  That's Voss  From the last comic standing  He was getting a lot  Of attention up there  With the national press  And stuff  And then all of a sudden  They look at me  And this was after  Our instance  St. Pat's  And I'm kind of like  Kind of like  Nodding like  Oh here it comes  They're going to  Recognize me too  You know  And they look at me  And like  Excuse me  And I'm ready to go  Yes that was me  And it was stupid  And all of a sudden  They go  Could you take the picture  A little taste of reality there 
[03:21:30]  Freaking Voss  To this day  Has not let  Let me forget this  This moment  And then I'm like  But I'm famous too  And they're like  Yeah whatever dude  We need a picture with Voss  To bring home with us  You know Patrice was on  Arrested Development  Was he?

[03:22:30]  Coming to the set?  You know  I haven't  I've read the reports  I haven't seen anything  Can I say that?  No  You can say that  Very safe  Very good answer  And I gotta tell you  David Cross  Is hysterical on the show  Yeah  He's a funny dude  And you know  The writers of our show  Really  Those guys are the stars  I mean they  Every week  Honestly  We are just paid monkeys  But guys like David Cross  He brings so much to it too 
[03:23:00]  Like he  He's a great improviser  You know  He brings a lot to the character  He's great man  It's good to see that the writing's coming back into this stuff  Because you know  That's why the reality shows just took off  Because it was the same old crap on TV  I know  And we were all looking for something new  And then Survivor hit  And it was like  Okay let's just start filming crap  You know  But with the Arrested Development  And the good writing  It gives hope  Everybody does know about  It's shot differently  It's really  You guys are very talented 
[03:23:30]  The actors and actresses on it  And the writing man  It's like  It's a lot more cutting edge  Than anything else you see  They're willing to take the risks and chances  And not worry about insulting people  Or offending people  With some of the content  And it's something you don't really see out there  It's a really really good show  That's what people want to see Edgy  They're sick and tired of seeing it  You know  We don't care about Will and Grace  And all that crap  You know  They want to see  That's why  Cookie cutter sugar coated crap  I can honestly say  I've never seen an episode of Will and Grace  But why do you think people watch HBO 
[03:24:00]  And Oz and Supra  They want to see what  You know  They don't want to see  Well you're right  You're totally right  And I've been so jaded  I don't watch stuff like this  My girlfriend actually turned me on  To Arrested Development  Because I'm so jaded with TV shows  I just won't watch them  And I sat down  I assumed it was going to be  The same old crap  And I sat down and watched it  It's really good  My favorite show  Curb Your Enthusiasm  Funny show man  Hey speaking of The Sopranos  You were on one of the shows no?  Yeah I did a couple of  What did you play? 
[03:24:30]  A small part  Did you get beat up  Or whacked or something?

No  You know  That's a true story  I went in there to read for it  For the guy David Chase  The creator of the show  And it was one line right?  And they literally said  Look you gotta go out to Queens  To audition  And you gotta spit out this one line  And I said alright  I go out there  I get in front of him  With the casting director  They go okay go ahead  And I kind of looked at him blankly

[03:35:30]  Where's my prep sheet?  I lost mine  I want to make sure we get to everything  That we were supposed to  But Electra is getting kind of bad reviews  What's her face?  Jennifer  Jennifer Garner  Jennifer Garner  Yeah she hurt her back doing that movie too  Some stunt  It's a spin off of Daredevil  And it's gonna be a piece of crap  Yeah  They're gonna really have to do something  With those superhero comic book movies  They're just pumping out too many now  Where characters that  Who gives a crap?  Stick to your basics 
[03:36:00]  You Batman  Superman  That's the latest trend though  They're even bringing Batman back  Just because Spider-Man did so well  Batman's coming back  But that kind of looks cool  I know but that franchise was dead  It was because of the way they did it  Right  I like the fact that they can bring it back  And do it totally differently  They're going back to the beginning  Right?  It's a  Yeah  Yeah it's back right after  His parents have died  Right  And he just  They show the whole torment  How it becomes Batman  Everything  Yeah that looks pretty cool  Christian Bale is gonna be Batman  He's a pretty cool actor  And then they got Superman coming out 
[03:36:30]  And I think I finally saw some of the casting  Lex Luthor  This pisses me off  It's Kevin Spacey  Yep  Enough Kevin Spacey  And Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane  I don't think Kevin Spacey's gonna  You don't think you can pull that off?  Ah  He's a great actor man  You see  Something about him bugs the crap out of me  You see Catwoman?  No I didn't see that piece of crap  It was so bad  They took her Oscar for Monsters Ball back  That's how bad  It's gonna have to go back to having sex on screen again 
[03:37:00]  That was such a hot freaking scene  Oh the one where she's with Billy Bob Thornton  Fucking fucking nails  Oh my god  That's one of the hottest scenes ever  How good is it?  She just needed it  And she needed it then  Oh after that scene  It was amazing  You know when you were in camp  You used to take the candles  And drip them on the bottles  To make the  That's what my stomach looked like  After that scene  I love when sex scenes are not about love  Man  In movies  I really do  That's bang  The other one I really love  Is the one from  The drug movie 
[03:37:30]  What?  Traffic  Traffic  Where the white chick  That sucks that scene  I love that scene  Because she was doing it for the drugs  Oh that's awful  And Michael Douglas is so close to finding her  But falling just short  And there's the big black guy  Banging his daughter  Because she's addicted to cocaine  That scene is so hot  And she's looking up  How is that hot?  I don't know man  When it's not about love 
[03:38:00]  These scenes  It's something  The whitey comes right out of me  When I see that scene  I'm just like  Oh no  You feel like George  You see Scott looking for his daughter  In hardcore  Yeah  Or nine and a half weeks  Remember that?  Don't  You know  Because these idiot listeners  Don't confuse it  I'm not into rape scenes  And scenes that are forced  It's more scenes that  The woman knows what she's doing  But it's not about love  Okay  How did she know what she was doing  In that scene?  It's about getting the drugs  It's about being lonely  Like Halle Berry was  In Monster's Ball 
[03:38:30]  Ugh  I love those scenes in movies  Drives me nuts  Sorry  In Ironweed  It's serving  Ironweed  Well it was for alcohol  There was a  Oh that movie Ironweed  Yeah  I never saw that  So Electra is going to be  A crappy movie  It looks like  We didn't even get to  Celebrity Fit Club today  With Ralphie Mae  He's coming in next week  I saw it  We got clips and stuff  Yeah we got  Maybe we could do  A quick clip here  I don't know where  There's so 
[03:39:00]  I mean these guys are doing  Such a good job for us  These days  That there's too much stuff  I shouldn't say that  Because then they're going to  Start slacking again  Degrade the fat people show  You know our country  It's all  Now we care about  Who loses weight  That's what it's about  Losing weight  Yeah  And catching criminals  You know what it is though  It ain't about the losing weight  It's the freak show  This is a circus side show  On television  The people used to  Go into tents  And pay the carnival barker  To go see the big fat lady  Now you turn on your TV  But what's wrong with that  You can see a bunch of fat people  I want to see this crap 
[03:39:30]  Oh there's nothing wrong with it  I was watching it  When I was watching and laughing  As they split them into two teams  And put them both on each side  Of a balance scale  One of the Baldwins is on it  Right  He's like the Eric Douglas  Of Baldwins  You know his brother's going  Jesus  Look at him  Look at him  He's a mess  You know he's on TV  A complete mess  And meanwhile Alec Baldwin's  Put out a couple of good movies recently  It's in a TV show  And he's got to watch his brother  On a scale  With fat people  He did one of the best monologues 
[03:40:00]  In Glen Gary Glen Ross  And his brother's standing on a scale  With Kim Coles  A scale with Wendy the Snapple girl  All right  All right  He just did a scene with Dustin Hoffman  And Jack Lemmon  And his brother's up there  His brother's standing on a scale  On VH1  He's doing sit-ups next to Biz Markie  Oh that is 
[03:40:30]  Life stinks  Oh my man  That is awful  That is funny  I was digging the show  I was watching it  Yeah  Pretty cool  I think I called Ralphie May out on this  Maybe not on the air  But behind  Maybe off  I don't remember  But I did  I brought it up to him  Because they have that footage of him  Underwater  Underwater man  They only film that  Because it looks absolutely awful  He's in swim trunks  Listen  You know he's got no shirt on  Ralphie took his clothes off  When we were at the house 
[03:41:00]  On the last comic standing  You couldn't see his unit  It was like a meat mud flap  Hanging over his unit  Right  I've gone out to dinner with Ralphie  Many times  Yeah  I'm telling you  We went to a sushi restaurant  $400 of sushi he ordered  Like $400  I'm not lying  Because he ordered the baby seal  Everything's  I'm telling you  That old gag  For the old listeners  Yeah  You know  We were watching that show  And I'm not giving anything away  Because it said on the show  Didn't he 
[03:41:30]  Didn't he gain  Wasn't he supposed to lose weight  Or something  Yeah he's supposed to lose weight  Yeah  On the show  Does he gain weight  I don't know  It's with the show  I sort of come in and try  Oh Jesus  Like I never watched these shows  And I watched it  If he's gaining weight  That's scary  Because he had the stomach thing done  He had  Listen to me  One  And that show  He's got  You can't lose weight  He should have his kitchen staple  That's my line  All right  Ralphie's  I mean he's a great  Around the country  He sells out  His race  But here's the thing 
[03:42:00]  Ant is the host  Well he does do the black humor  He's  I saw my Carolines  I thought he was hilarious  Ant is the host  Ant's the host  Who's  I'm telling you  Every time he speaks  Liberace  He rolls over in his grave  Oh I know  I was over  Butt up  You know  Oh  Horrible  He is  I can't stand that guy  He is  He is  So unfunny  He's not funny at all  Sorry  Not funny  To that over the top  Gay act  That just  You know  Sorry 
[03:42:30]  It's being done already  Look up Mario Cantone  Yeah  Ant  As I last conversation  He said to me  He goes  Am I a hack  What  What  To the third power  Does a hack mean faggot  I know  Do you have to ask  Hold on  Baldwin's going back  On the scale  We got the audio  Of Daniel Baldwin  Going on the scale  Oh we do  On this new show  Let's take a listen  Daniel  Your weight tonight  Uh oh  Uh oh  Is 264 pounds 
[03:43:00]  How do you feel about that  That's high  That's high  You may appear to be  That's terrific  The fittest  And most athletic  Member of the group  Yeah  But your blood work  Actually reveals  A different picture  You're on the very brink  Of diabetes  Wow that's very scary  My mother  Was diagnosed  With latent diabetes  In her late 50s  It tends to run  It tends to run in families  Is Alec Baldwin  Sitting there  Watching this  Just wanting to slit 
[03:43:30]  His wrists  Just like  I work hard  To be an actor  I'm doing  And there's my brother  Standing on a fat scale  Being totally  As diabetes  On VH1  On VH1  And you know  A lot of these stupid  Rubes that watch this show  They don't pay  That close attention  So they're thinking  It might even be  Alec Baldwin  On that show  Right  Because they look  Close enough  If you put those  Three brothers together  It's like the evolution  Of horrible  In this poster  VH1  Then a horrible movie  And then Alec Baldwin  Alec Baldwin 
[03:44:00]  Who was banging  Kim Basinger  And this guy's probably  Hitting on the Snapple girl  Like you said  Oh Wendy the Snapple girl  This is so funny  The next way in  Is Judge Maybelline  From Divorce Court  Yeah she's the  Divorce court judge  You saw the show last night  Yeah yeah  I was watching  They're standing there  Very judgmental  The judges  Whatever they are  They're sitting there  On this panel  And there's this  Huge lighted scale  A platform really  It's not even a scale  It's like a truck  Where the trucks  Pull up on the highway  And they stand on it 
[03:44:30]  And then a little  Digital readout  Comes out in front  Of one of the judges  And he tells them  Their weight  And they're all like  Oh yes  It's a very somber moment  Very serious  You know you're not  Supposed to laugh  Meanwhile  Like I'm home  With my chick  Taking bets  On what it's gonna be  It's gotta be over  Three bills  Gotta be over  Three bills  On this one man  Wait didn't you see  When they were on  The balance scale  At the end  Oh at the end  Is the best part  Yeah it's not the balance  But then they put them  On this giant  Ant comes down  And go  And let them  Now the biggest  Balance scale ever  You know  And they load them on 
[03:45:00]  And talk about  As a team  They're both like  One ton each  It's horrible  And they put them on  And the scale  Tips over one way  A little bit  It's the kind of scale  Columbians weigh drugs on  It's a giant  It's a giant  Balance beam  Scale  Balance scale  Alright here's  Judge Maybelline  Getting weighed in  Good evening Judge  Good evening Dr. Katz  Please step on the scale  Doctor  Oh my god  Do I have to?  Ha ha ha ha  They all have little  Scale jokes  Right so 
[03:45:30]  Oh goodness  They could already  Figure it out  By looking at you  Idiot  Tonight  Your weight is  208 pounds  208  You know what's great  To watch about this show  When they step up  To the scale  All these fatties  Are like  Trying to joke  About it  Like they're all going  Alright well  Like one guy  Stands on one foot  Like that's going to 
[03:46:00]  Make a difference  On the scale  And ha ha  And they try to get a laugh  And the judges  Are just looking at  Because they know  Where that  That humor attempt  Is coming from  From that sad place  And that fat little chest  Taylor  I saw just a peek  When we were  You know  In the office  Before the show today  And they also are  Doing something  Where they show the person  What they're going to look like  If they continue  Yeah they did that  With Mia  Mia Tyler  Is her last name Tyler?  Oh yeah  Or did she change it?  It's Liv Tyler's  Fat sister  Which man 
[03:46:30]  If you've got to be fat  Why would you have  Liv Tyler for a sister?  That is the most awful thing  And Liv Tyler  Had a kid recently  So you know  The two sisters  Kind of bonded  Because Liv Tyler  Probably gained  You know  Maybe 30-40 pounds  During her pregnancy  Look I'm fat like you  I'm fat like you  But then you know  Lost it in one day  And Mia's still fat though  And the judges go  You know  What went wrong?  You know  They say that  You know  None of them  Tell my uncle  Touched me  But you know  Ralphie goes  Well I was in a car accident  I broke a lot of bones  Obviously not your jaw bones  Okay 
[03:47:00]  What was the car accident?  They put the big thing of ribs  On the side window  And your car tipped over?  Unbelievable  Yeah  Biz Markie  Biz Markie was up there  He took his shirt off  I swear to God  It looked like  He should have started  Throwing feces at the camera  And punching shrubbery  It looked like  A National Geographic  It did  If he lost five pounds 
[03:47:30]  Just in his bottom lip  That hung down  Oh Jesus  My God  What a mess  Did he have baloney tits  And all that?  Oh  Disgusting  Yeah  Big fat mess  Biz Markie  And then they showed them all  Younger  In these old pictures of them  And they weren't all fat  When they were kids  Yeah because they were fetuses  The pictures  They were sonograms  So they showed Mia  And what she's going to look like  If she continues eating  Yeah they did a computer  Animation  Of her body blowing up  And of course  They make it just ridiculous  Yeah  Blowing up her body 
[03:48:00]  I think they just superimposed  Ralphie Mae's body  On her head  But you know  To be unfathom  They're round  They're a game on the beach  That's what they are with kids  They're round  They're opening themselves up  For ridicule  I mean if there's someone out there  Going  You know  This is a serious  Oh  Stop it up  You know what  It's a freak show  Hire an assistant to do this  Smack your hand  Okay  That's the big  You're overweight  In this country  We're just a bunch of babies  Oh we can accept  You know  Oh we're all sick  It has to  You know what it is  It's gotten to the point too  These celebrities are just 
[03:48:30]  So desperate for attention  Now they'll just ridicule themselves  They present it under the guise of helping  Again  This reality show  You can't put a reality show on  And actually be real  About what it's about  This isn't about  Let's try to help them lose weight  And get healthier  It's no  Let's put a bunch of fat people  On a balance scale  That's what it is  Yeah because  It's not about them losing weight  Because the payoff's not enough  On these shows  Right  You know  Because it's not a big enough payoff  Who cares  In 10 episodes  Okay so they lose 12 pounds 
[03:49:00]  It's a big deal  No it's get Ralphie Mae  In a bathing suit  And throw him in the pool  With an underwater camera  So it looks like  A manatee  Yeah a trip to  Aqua World  Yeah  You know  Ralphie Mae gets out of the water  He's got propeller marks on his back  From the speed boats  In the channel  Sure  We'll talk to him about this next week  I can't wait  And he's a great guy  He really is  He's a nice guy  He's a funny  He may have saved our career  The last time we were here  They showed his chick  They showed his chick on this show  They showed him at home 
[03:49:30]  Eating in the kitchen  I'm like  His chick is pretty hot  Yeah but you know  She's beautiful  And she's sweet  She's beautiful  Really nice girl  She goes  I met Ralphie  And it would have been rude  If I didn't go out with him  What are you even talking about  You know  If you met  You know  If you met  You know  What do you call it  The kid from Mask  It wouldn't be rude  Not to go out  I mean Ralphie's a great guy  He's my friend  I'm not trashed Ralphie at all  He's really my friend  And I think he's really funny  Well she thinks that way  Because she's from Canada  It's odd  The chick is from Canada too  Yeah  It's odd that you would get 
[03:50:00]  An attractive skinny girl  Yeah  By no stretch of the imagination  Even chubby  She's skinny  And it's rare that you would get  A girl like that  Hooking up with a fat guy  Well maybe she always wanted  To be a top  What?
