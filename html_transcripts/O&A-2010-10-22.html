<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of a parody video created by Carter and Jackie, mocking Opie and Anthony's career highlights.  The video featured clips of their stunts, including the $100,000 candy bar giveaway, the Boston mayor prank, the Voyeur Bus incident, and the "Sex for Sam" contest. Opie and Anthony reacted with a mix of amusement and annoyance, highlighting the disparity in their own success and notoriety compared to Carter and Jackie's relatively low social media presence. This segued into a "Jocktober" segment comparing their show to the more subdued John and Jeff, and included playing clips from Man Cow's show, featuring a possibly staged car crash involving "Turd," and a prank call from Anthony to Man Cow, characterized by a lengthy serious discussion before the insult.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about weddings prompted by Opie's attendance at two on consecutive Fridays.  This led to anecdotes about awkwardly timed weddings, a caller sharing a story about a pirate-themed wedding, and reminiscing about Colin Quinn's career and the cancellation of "Tough Crowd."  The hosts expressed strong opinions on the firing of Juan Williams from NPR, the Parents Television Council, and the controversy surrounding a racy "Glee" photoshoot. The segment concluded with a vulgar discussion about a wheelchair-bound high school football player scoring a touchdown, touching on political correctness and the perceived "feminization" of American culture, along with brief mentions of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Awakenings," and Pearl Jam radio's launch on SiriusXM.

The next segment started with a discussion of a viral video depicting a seemingly staged arrest involving a drunk man, a police officer, and a pink dildo.  Cheech Marin then called in to promote his and Chong's show, discussing their career, tour (including Cheech's son as DJ and Chong's wife as a comedian), and fan interactions.  Anthony recounted a recent altercation with a reckless driver, using Google Earth to illustrate the incident.  The show then featured Roland, a returning staff member, discussing his time away, job search, and humorous anecdotes.  They discussed upcoming guests, including the possibility of Omar and Marlo from *The Wire*, and promoted Joe Curry's comedy show, commenting on his promotional photos, his work ethic, and Jimmy's account of a recent indulgent meal.

The final segment centered around a caller, Jimmy, describing his childhood experience with encopresis.  This sparked humorous, crude, and sexually suggestive banter with the hosts and other callers.  Dr. Steve called in to explain encopresis.  Opie's infant son made an unscheduled appearance, leading to more off-color jokes.  Paul Masson and a comedian named Foot appeared to promote their shows, a Jimmy McMillan political ad parody was played, and E-Rock smelled Opie's son's hair from a Tupperware container, leading to further humorous commentary and discussion of Opieâ€™s mother saving his baby teeth.

[00:23:00]  that uh we used to be on the same station as these guys all right wow they're two guys who shared the  same station oh yes i'm excited why aren't you excited i think i know it's my favorite show of  all time excited is he still going over to thailand there are two guys who go to the philippines for  young girls we don't know for sure we don't know for sure i think they sort of said they uh i don't 
[00:23:30]  know i don't know we gotta be careful we used to listen driving in yes we did and just go  and commiserate over how awful can we do it right away i can't wait and and we used to go into the  bathroom and crank their show because it made us shit better it just shows you how awful radio is  because this stupid show is syndicated everywhere because i guess it's a safe show so cbs radio just  popped them on in a million markets for overnights yeah we are two guys i don't even remember the name  of the show i just know they're they're hoping to blow i mean jeff and uh uh wait john and jeff 
[00:24:00]  john and jeff wow very good yes i would have never got that but it's amazing but i didn't remember it  i remembered it i like the way you're scarred emotionally you remember something yeah like a  dog if you hit the dog when it's small will always remember you that's how i remember now they're  they're a show that have two guys obviously yes no hole and they they can't do it right they  they pretty much are their own holes to each other yes to each other you're amazed that they're 
[00:24:30]  straight yeah not that there's anything wrong with the fact that you put a penis in your anus  that's the positive wrong that's the good part  they uh the funny part to me was how they would always take stands against things that just weren't  risky like you know john and jeff they don't like when children are kidnapped yeah wow  really they believe that you shouldn't kill your own citizens all right first time i've seen sam 
[00:25:00]  run down the hall in october that's how excited he is with his little duck feet yeah their stands  are just uh i i'm trying to remember the real ones because they're just as bad as the ones you're  making up we never got to dummy's collection of stuff that his mommy we're gonna do that too  i want to get we'll wrap up this week of radio and style that out of the way sorry yeah that uh  card and jackie are on vacation so you're gonna have to deal with our horse shit today yeah uh what's up sam  well i mean please you want it there are two guys you want to do jocktober it's still a mystery

[00:26:00]  because they mean there's not a lot of talk channels left oh they're not on in new york  anymore because when we went away they lost their slot exactly they're like a station's hamburger  helper where you need to you know bulk up the for the uh the lineup a little bit uh so you throw  them in to finish off to finish off the hours sometimes you're looking for hamburgers sometimes  you're looking for pizza hey scorch are you still me i know scorch yeah sometimes you want hamburger 
[00:26:30]  sometimes you want pizza unfortunately you're shit but i don't know why we're talking about john and  jeff if it hasn't been confirmed what show all right let's do the sweeper and then we'll uh see what  show we're featuring today for jock tober  sam who are we featuring today well i'd like to stray from the uh normal routine 
[00:27:00]  yeah and instead of announcing who we're featuring i think we should start with just  playing the first clip that's a very good idea the clip just hit the clip and i like this let  them tell you who we're listening to all right the john and jeff the john and jeff  so happy the john i don't know why just brings brings me back in time yeah walk in the hallways of

[00:28:30]  they agree with each other if there's one thing you want to hear on the radio it's two guys agreeing  with each other we are two guys yeah we believe juan williams should not have been fired that's  taking a stand stop stop what whoa you want to get fired whoa come on these guys are uh they're  we'll get into it later but npr is in deep shit i know they are about that they just fucked up their  whole goddamn world what dummies with their agenda well they're arguing yeah they have an argument 
[00:29:00]  i know yeah we'll see we'll see if they win that argument crime you gotta do the time where'd you  guys who think vegetarians should just mind their own business where'd you guys who think the divorce  rate would be eighty percent if a man didn't lose half where'd you guys who think anyone caught driving  without car insurance should have their vehicle impounded wow that's crazy wow the worst stances ever  but you gotta listen right it does draw you in i've never heard less interesting stances no their 
[00:29:30]  stances are horrible i've heard more interesting stances taken on bazooka joe cartoons  it's horrible i forgot how terrible their stances are they're horrendous we're two guys  that right there is debatable hey we haven't said fuck in a few minutes yeah yeah we don't want to  disappoint uh carter jackie that's all we know so fuck fuck fucking john and fucking jeff fuck fuck  we're two guys who believe that proper change should always be given how would you say that 
[00:30:00]  i don't know uh sam yeah i'm a rain man that's a promo from last year i'm not i'm not stupid  right are you kidding me i remember i remember yes what are you doing you getting lazy no they  don't use the we're two guys promos anymore oh what they they moved on from that as far as you are  undermining your journalistic integrity no i i wasn't i was full disclosure made by opie you were 
[00:30:30]  ready to just let it go as if this was off of one of today's shows that is true i wanted to make sure  that opie made the announcement i know he's rain man i knew he would remember so they don't do the  two guys thing anymore well they haven't come up with something better no we're two faggots  maybe they got a little too outrageous with that promo and they had to calm it down we're two  hermaphrodites who believe the genitals of both sexes is good in the last month of shows all their  promos have just been uh callers saying how much they like john and jeff and then john and jeff 
[00:31:00]  and make that promo for them unless you you're told by the screener now make sure you say uh love  you love the show yeah and uh so i just wanted to make sure we had a couple of these from last  year for nostalgia's sake but didn't you follow suit yeah i did you sure did you have a great call  call on a great subject what a dick i got so excited you actually made his show that i got so  excited i couldn't i couldn't drop the bomb i wanted to drop the big bomb and funniest fucking 
[00:31:30]  moment ever was you just making a real point and getting hung up and i got hung up on and then  they just started elaborating on my point i added to the program it was probably it probably turned  into like an hour-long phone topic no for him he made his day a lot easier great i wanted to  and i was just ready to dive in and uh the whole purpose was to beat the shit out of man cow that day  oh i was a good caller for his show where has he been see you around he's rocking he's rocking how is  oh yeah what fake radio is he doing these days um they can believe he's political now because 
[00:32:00]  that's yeah he's doing please that's what's hot out there political talk for sure yeah oh do we have  that call you want to hear i hear the call this was when we were uh we were uh i don't even remember  but man cow once again was pissing us off with his horse shit yeah he's a shock jock when that's  popular now he's a political talk show host because that's popular uh who's the real man miserably  who the fuck knows turd and uh i don't even remember turd uh turd but then um turd 
[00:32:30]  can we play turd going into the wall it's my favorite bit of all time going into the wall too  eric always this is great eric always wanted to be turd growing up uh turd eric wanted to be the  now he is yes now he just wants to be as as good as a turd he's gonna be sorry organ the best part  about this uh prank is the fact that you can't tell that it was done in a production studio it's  it's amazing what do you mean it was done in a production studio no you can't you can't tell 
[00:33:00]  i don't think it was driving into a wall i think he actually went into a wall i think so that's what  i have to believe after listening to this it's so real so real you'd think they'd fake it because  it's so dangerous yeah yeah but they didn't because turd does stuff for real and we've never  heard the same exact sound effects on the discs that are all over the place nope not at all that's  what makes turd turd turd turd i need that for my machine now i love that turd i'm gonna claim 
[00:33:30]  that one and if that's okay with you i need turd on my machine fucking turd hey go ahead take turd  i think this one was so big that it was on one of his cds good here what's up actress helps fight  sex crime and it's fucking the chick from french of course she does look at that arm  every time you want to rape someone she shows up and your dick wilts  uh let's see the uh the the phone call oh we're going with turd first a turd first  no turd turd's not in uh in the system that's eric's got that on the scene 
[00:34:00]  oh he rocks he's got to pull it off his unlike sam who ran down the hall he rocks sauntering  he throws his arms up we're live on the air you could sprint 10 yards you ever see sam hustle  down that hallway he yeah he's a lot lighter than that oh man now he's using his way he's more  heavy set he rocks giving up just in time for his wedding he really is gaining weight oh he's giving  up most people don't give up just in time for their wedding wow they make it look good right up to 
[00:34:30]  the wedding he's gonna have fat guy wedding pictures he's gonna have fat guy wedding pictures  you don't want fat guy wedding pictures you don't want them if you don't have to be fat  i understand there's large people out there and you do what you can that's fine truth of the matter is  but eric is not supposed to be a fat guy he's gaining weight for the wedding the truth is though  what you're probably at your best right before you get married right on average a lot of guys um  are are in good shape they're in their good and the girls too in good shape right before they get 
[00:35:00]  married and then after marriage it's very hard to get better physically when you're married so  you're saying he's going to need to get his wedding band resized because his fingers get getting  chubbier yes this is the best we're going to see iraq look right here his shirt is terrible  oh it's terrible it's another awful shirt yeah all i want to do is play man cow stuff i got the disc in  front of me i mean you got the fake air horn bit he did oh yes you got the fake cleaning off 
[00:35:30]  the boss's desk bit oh god no that one you got the where he claims that he was called to replace  stern and we work for cbs uh yeah yeah they called me uh to this day even though we don't really get  along with those guys as much anymore to this day they laugh at that clip they said that he wasn't  even being considered his name never even came up i know i could completely prove that with one phone  call uh oh my pale head chicken legs the bits just go on and on they're they're amazing but you want 
[00:36:00]  to hear the car crash with uh who's in this uh oh i forgot the guy turd oh turd here's turd this was  this was the big bit that day for man yeah this is great phony man cow yes turd are you ready bud  15 15 miles an hour he's going to give us the countdown the engine noise is constant through  the whole thing yeah you don't hear like it it doesn't waver at all like he's increasing in speed 
[00:36:30]  but it's just hold on i know what you're doing it and it's brilliant and and it leads to a bit  how many things we could uh find wrong with this bit all right i was just gonna say also that not  only does the uh the engine so that's one anthony's engine sound sounds the same but the engine sound  isn't coming in over the phone the engine sound is in the studio yeah yeah you hear this sound from  turd the phone noise yeah but the uh the engine itself is in the studio you'd think he would at 
[00:37:00]  least be in a car see yeah yeah yeah you would think so you would run if you did this bit properly  you would run the whole bit through a phone you'd probably get in the car get in the parking lot  or even if you use a drive around you would throw that through a phone filter type right right so  that's one plus and said the uh the uh engine stays the same sound throughout the whole bit and i want  to add that no one would be nervous going 15 miles an hour no no no he's already freaking out at 15 
[00:37:30]  miles an hour so that's three things wrong with the bits so far turd yes sir are you ready bud  15 15 miles an hour he's going to give us the countdown he's racing into the side of a factory  35  30 miles an hour  and then of course let's point out that the hole is freaking out in the background doing her role 
[00:38:00]  perfectly anything happens to him cow she doesn't want anything bad she said yeah i'm not turd it's  really low in the mix so that's one good thing that man cow did that day keeping the hole nice and low  in the mix  30 miles an hour  35  35 miles an hour right now  maximum speed of 65  a long course has been set up  oh my god  come on turd  35  ah they lost the call i hope turd is okay 
[00:38:30]  they lost turd how fake that is the worst bit i've ever heard look have we been perfect with our bits  over the years i'll be the first one to say absolutely no no but holy shit how bad is that 
[00:39:00]  oh the crash i've heard that before on sound effects cds get some sound effects and make  iraq drive into a factory tonight yes i think that would be fun  entomans  you want to force the other side it'll be empty  he likes cake  oh he loves it  you want to force iraq to redo the bit  yeah yeah in the production room  you know we really should get him because he's a good actor too  and have iraq do the turd into the wall bit  and he also has to do man cow's part too 
[00:39:30]  he has to do the whole bit himself  wow just do it himself  you have to  what's this  what  me doing the bit  wait wait what  we already did this bit  we have alzheimer's  twice  twice  he did the bit twice  wow  what did that happen  jesus  like in the last year and a half  what's wrong with us  we made you do the bit  yeah we've aired it  wow  get the fuck out of here  how did the kid in the fat suit remember it  no one else  it's iraq  oh shit  no 
[00:40:00]  oh he's doing a steve strategy  that's what steve did  yes  that strategy didn't do  kiss you and hug you  that wasn't  wow  you know getting older  this show is more fun  because every day it's new to us  every day we get new material  we actually did this bit  oh boy  you know what though  thinking about it  if we played it  we absolutely would have made iraq do it  alright here's iraq doing that exact same bit  alright guys  I'm ready  15  20 
[00:40:30]  25  30  35  40  45  oh no  is iraq okay  what happened to iraq  iraq drove into a factory  of course he did it by himself 
[00:41:00]  no one  no one cared enough to play along  that is great  holy shit  he did the bit  for god  alright let me say hi to  mike in  missouri  mikey  mike  hey guys  love you  love the show  what's up  hey man  after you get done with this one  can you play the one  where man count turd are in that  dirigible  throwing them  I think it was bra  bra bombs  ah they're bra bombs  I was the one 
[00:41:30]  that said  you know  we weren't perfect  with our stupid  bra bombing  he's not even  in the same class  guys  I have to say  the end of the bra bombing  bit was not good  that sucked ass  the end of that bit  was really not solid  oh no  no  but I don't  you gotta look at all  you gotta look at all our bits  is what I say  you have to celebrate  our entire catalog  that's right  and man  even zeppelin had a few duds 
[00:42:00]  man count didn't spend a month  tearing apart  all of his old material  the way you guys took your AAF show  and just dismantled yourselves  that's why the Carter and Jackie thing  that we started the show off with  is so stupid  we made fun of ourselves  as far as the Hall and Oates thing  they thought they were breaking new ground  like Ann said  remember when you guys broke into your boss's office  to get those Aerosmith tickets  oh yeah  and we played all that on the air  and beat the shit out of ourselves  yes you did  but these guys take themselves  way too seriously 
[00:42:30]  and they think these bits are actually good  and stand the test of time  turd  which one do you want to hear next  I don't even know  snap crackle call  alright I'll list them  they're all fake  by the way  phone scam  you got cheers  you got chicken legs  you got pale head  rocky blessing  air horn to ear  cleaning off boss's desk  oh desk I think  and then the famous replacement lie  that he told Hannity  I don't know  I like the desk I think  you want to go desk  clean off the boss's desk 
[00:43:00]  we haven't played these in a while  have we  no  anytime the boss is involved  look out  yeah  cause this is dangerous  oh ok  this is dangerous  and I  do you know who does this bit  I um  I'm trying to remember  dude  turn  turn  that's right  turn again  ok  I'm gonna get fired for this  you're not gonna get fired  I won't let you get fired  I'll protect you man  you're gonna have to bat for me  alright  dramatic  uh go  why are you whispering  why are you whispering on the radio  why are you whispering on the radio  that's a really good point  why would you whisper on the radio 
[00:43:30]  hey  hey  we're gonna try to get away with this  don't tell anybody  shh  whispering  that's a good point  I'm gonna get fired  listen  you're not gonna get fired  I won't let you get fired  I'll protect you man  you're gonna have to bat for me  alright  uh go ahead  you have the uh the gas  you think turd wanted to be in jackass  oh  so badly  and he got stuck with the stupid mad cow  knowing a little bit about turds  I bet you he actually wanted to do all this stuff  and man cow's like  no we gotta  no we gotta just fake it  faking is good enough 
[00:44:00]  do you have the uh the gas powered leaf blower  yeah  turn it on and go into his office  and clean off his desk  this is national  clean off your boss's desk week  turd  yeah  you ought to see this office  turd  this guy is like  I think there was an edit there  huh  turd  get back in the kitchen  wang  hey wang  oh  can we play that  yes  I just want to play bad radio bits  god radio is a fucking atrocious 
[00:44:30]  so do you got some chinese food there wang  yes  yeah  do you deliver  yes  yeah  can you deliver here  yes  yeah do you got some chow mein  yes  that's how the bit went  was it that bad  oh yeah  yeah yeah  it was just that edited crap  and then the famous line in that bit is  get back in the kitchen  wang  yeah  and then you hear  yes  yeah hey do you beat your wife  well sometimes I do 
[00:45:00]  oh the bad  it's like the bad edit  sometimes I do  do we have that one  sometimes I like doing  is that on one of the bad  is that on one of the bad AF  it's just horrible  I hate those  you can so tell  they cut off the fucking shit  it's just awful  is that on one of the bad AF CDs  I'm sure  do we have that somewhere  hey wang  maybe it's  under unusual suspects  dude  we had to be a part of their horse shit 
[00:45:30]  whatever  here's the cleaning off the desk  turd  yeah  you ought to see this office too  this guy is like really really anal  of course  turn it on man  I want to hear it  okay tell him when you're in the office  can I answer a question  are you in there  yeah yeah  if you were whispering a second ago  why would you be laughing loudly  and running a leaf blower  yeah  that kind of defeats the purpose of whispering 
[00:46:00]  of whispering  well it's okay  Cal's got the turds back  and you know at the time  he was going to replace Howard  with this amazing fucking radio  oh yeah great stuff  of course  he was of course the guy  that should replace Howard  holy shit  he was the one  he was the chosen one  with these shite  fucking man  Cal go fuck yourself  are you in there  what's on the desk 
[00:46:30]  turd  turd  what the hell is going on  I can hear papers being shredded  can you  what's going on  I've got it  what  it's going to borrow papers  turn off the thing  turn it off  turn it off  he can't  he can't turn it off  turn it off  that's how it ends  that's how it ends 
[00:47:00]  it fades out  because if he turns it off  it would have just cut right off  when they hit the stop button  they probably found a sound effect  they probably found a sound effect  that was five minutes long  so they didn't know really how to turn it off  so they had to fade it out  you know what's even more sad  it did sound like a vacuum cleaner  not a leaf blower  you know what's even more sad  this show was huge in Chicago  yeah I know  with shit like this  this show was fucking huge in Chicago  because the common man  likes to hear somebody  giving it back to the boss 
[00:47:30]  ah Sam  right  well Sam  it reminds me of the time  that we actually had a couple  have sex  not only just sex  anal sex  on Ken Stevens' leather couch  and there's a guy here  at SiriusXM  that we don't talk to anymore  unfortunately  for whatever reason  maybe someday  he can explain that to us  who actually saw it  so he could prove  this went down  we didn't fake  we didn't fake a couple  having sex  on the boss's couch  we did it  turd  you got your penis  in her ass turd  turd  turd

[00:53:00]  in Chicago  for many years  was that man  cow  it was on his  show  sound like turd  maybe it was turd  oh okay  was that turd  you think  turd  every time  it's gonna make me laugh  turd  keep me happy today  just keep playing turd  turd  there you go  wow  we'll finish up  we'll finish up  this man cow  beating  that came out  of nowhere  by the way  part of jocktober  I guess  with one of his  many lies  jocktober classic  this is when stern  was leaving  regular radio 
[00:53:30]  to come to  Sirius  oh yeah  yeah  yeah  and I don't know  why  but Hannity  kind of likes  the man cow  on his show  every once in a while  and this goes back  obviously a few years  and man cow  couldn't wait  to get on Hannity  to tell the world  that he was  being considered  to replace Howard  which was just  a complete fucking lie  yes  and I said  I said  wait till number one  fails  wait till the second  stern replacement  fails  and then the third  stern  wait where was  the second replacement  for stern 
[00:54:00]  hey  hmm  I said Nick Cannon  is the third  yeah  yeah  and then the third  stern replacement  is gonna be you  that's great  I get to be the third  stern replacement  you can tell this guy  thinks the world of me  right  I replaced a legend  in New York  by the name of Bob Grant  right  and I was  never heard of him  yeah well you're not  in New York  but listen Sean  Sean here's the thing  you never want to come on  after a show  that was popular  and I understand that  and I never wanted to do it 
[00:54:30]  I never ever  and it was offered  to me at one point  and I don't want to do it  I didn't want to do it  can I tell you something  oh my god  how embarrassing  there's not a radio guy  alive that would not  take that job  even though it would  be a really tough spot  because the amount of  fucking money  you can make  he's such a fucking liar  it was offered to me  I didn't take a turd  here's a guy that  tried to get in  New York radio  for his entire career  and I think he finally did it  I think he's doing  like a weekend  or weekend show 
[00:55:00]  on an AM station  or something  doing political talk  because that's what's hot  right now  he tried forever  to get in  and he's now saying  that he wouldn't  have taken that job  and it was offered  to me at one point  and I don't want to do it  I didn't want to do it  and the thing is  why would I want that  the audiences  have left  I gotta go build  an audience  for a company  that I don't like  I'm fine here  where I'm working  for people I like  sometimes  really  the ones that  threw your ass out 
[00:55:30]  whatever  it's old news  obviously  but that's  just a blatant lie  it's a good spin though  if you were never asked  then you could turn around  and make believe  they did ask you  and you turned them down  we should do that  maybe if he played  car sound effects  during saying that  when he was saying  that he was offered  the job  I was offered  the job  or leaf blower  what an asshole  you know what  that bit was missing  what  turd 
[00:56:00]  yeah exactly  exactly  turd  because of that  we didn't do  John and Jeff yet  oh god  well we still have  them to look forward to  alright we'll break  and do John and Jeff  for Jacktober  what a special day  today is  it is  do you guys still  not want to hear  Anthony calling  man cow  oh fuck  we haven't even  done that yet  the fucking  shit dick fanboy  over here  yeah my dumb  fucking prank call  but I didn't  do the prank part  that's the greatest  moment  I don't even  remember the setup  a prank call  without the prank  is a call  hey is your  refrigerator running 
[00:56:30]  yes it is  well that's good  to know  we're just checking  click  I forgot  but we just  got a hold of  man cow  we were going  to finally  have it out  with him  and got on  I got on  and I used  the typical  I know  I used the  typical thing  you're supposed  to do  set it up  help the show  yes  lull them  into a false  sense of security  it was perfect  and then  you blast out  the comment  whatever you want  to do to ruin 
[00:57:00]  their show  but first you  got to kind  of throw a  little real  topic in there  to get  them off  guard  make it like  you're one  of their  pals  but is this  also the  call where  the screener  tells me  what I'm  supposed to  do  that's not  in the  call  if you want  to hear  it first  I can  grab it  real quick  what you  said  because it  is so  funny  it's  right  it's just  such a  phony  thing that  they made  all the  callers  do  right  we don't  force  callers  to say  something  when they  come on  our show 
[00:57:30]  if you want  to say  something cool  fine  and it's  nice  but  you know  man cow  forced every  caller to  to say  love you  love the  show  I think  yeah  keep your  comments  clean  short and  sweet  to the  point  and start  off by  saying  man cow  love you  love your  show  okay  that was  their screener  yeah that's  why we do  jocktober  this shit  can't go  unnoticed  and then  Anthony  it was time  for Anthony  to finally  confront  man cow  and this  is how  it went  down  Tony in New York  hello 
[00:58:00]  man cow  love you  love the  show man  hey I want  to talk a little  bit about this  Britain situation  with the  sailors that were  taken hostage  as I see it  there's a  problem  I don't see  the president  speaking out  on this  and now I'm  hearing that  the United  States has been  told not to  comment by  Britain  because of  the world  view  of our  country  the British  are telling  us to please  stay out of  this so as  not to make  trouble  I see this  as maybe 
[00:58:30]  Britain turning  on us a  little bit  as an ally  in this  situation  what do you  think about  this  I think  that's a  brilliant  question  thank you  thank you  man  I think  we need to  keep our  nose out of  it right  now  I think  we got  all  we're like  that  well Sam  Childers  knew this  pygmy woman  in Uganda  she's a nice  girl she's  always sticking  her nose  in people's  business  and I  think  we need  to keep  our nose  out of  everybody's  business  right now  and I  think  England  is saying  let us 
[00:59:00]  handle it  and I'm  okay with  that for  now  but you  better believe  if it  starts to  hit the  fan  once again  we'll be  there  to save  them  it's the  man cow  show  fucker  cut me  off  you should  have done  them in the  middle  it was  tough  it was  actually  a valid  question  I was  waiting  to come  back  that's  why I  said  do you  like  shit  like  that  would  it  be  funny  if  Anthony  just  became  a  caller  to  the  man  show  and never  confronted  that's  pretty much  what just  happened  Jimmy  we're back

[01:08:30]  puffy shirt  in the puffy shirt  i want to be a pirate  the white puffy shirt  yes  by the way is  collins show opening  today there was a  picture of him and jerry  it was twittered going  over lights  see his commercial  yeah i heard it  yes i saw his  commercial on television  i'm so pumped for him  remember back in the  xm days he came in  once and he was  really frustrated because  he said i have all this  stuff in my i'll never  forget the conversation  do you remember the  conversation on his  computer he said i have  so much stuff in my  apartment i don't know  what to do with it he  says he's been writing  all sorts of things he  needs somebody to go in  there and organize it  yes in his computer and 
[01:09:00]  i'm so glad that it it  it he's finally got  something out of it it  makes me like i mean  i dislike seinfeld i  don't know him but i  love the fact that he's  he loves colin he's all  in with loves fucking  all the fuck all the  way in with him great  and again he helped get  tough crowd picked up by  showing up back we were  doing in november of uh  2002 we had just gotten  tossed off the air and  we were in the getting  together stages with it  and seeing what the show  is going to be called we  were all trying to come  up with names and we  were doing test shows in 
[01:09:30]  the offices on 53rd street  like in the back office we  were just sitting around  table and be funny i was  bombing every show no  cameras just comedy  central execs and  seinfeld would come in  and be a part of it um  and i know that was to  fucking help put his  stamp on it to help  colin get the show  picked up that's awesome  it did it helps doing  all the interviews with  colin because maybe  colin doesn't get on  larry king if if  seinfeld's not sitting  with him so seinfeld's  like well fuck that we're  getting on larry king  seinfeld's the juice  he's a true friend of  colin's he and he's  only obvious yeah he's  great man that tough 
[01:10:00]  crowd was ahead of its  time because now a lot of  people are doing that  tough crowd thing man  yeah we're trying it's a  watered down version of  what you guys are doing  but on the on the replay  we replay the next night  at seven or seven thirty  right uh after the daily  show we actually did  better than the daily  show in the replay not  that it was a bigger show  than the daily show it was  not but in the replay  people a lot of people  watched it right it had  its audience a big  audience but it lasted  longer than it did how  many years did it go to  full season i know why it  got knocked out i have no 
[01:10:30]  idea why they would have  taken that off jesus come  on um i'll speculate that  maybe maybe a person  fired someone that they  weren't they shouldn't  have and i came back to  haunt them maybe it was  behind the scenes shit  yep that uh but it  wasn't a ratings issue at  all and maybe certain  complaints from certain  people in viacom over some  of the content on the  show it was very  politically incorrect a  lot of making fun of  there's a lot you know  exhausting yeah okay  why don't we do uh  jacktober uh who are we  uh featuring today i  forgot it's a mystery show  it's a mystery show 
[01:11:00]  all right we'll start  with the uh the uh the  uh the promo from last  year again yeah because  it's been about an hour  since we uh started the  jock told yes the john  and jeff show the john  and jeff show we're two  guys who think if you lie  about a crime you gotta do  the time we're two guys  who think vegetarians should  just mind their own  business we're two guys  who think the divorce rate  would be 80 percent if a  man didn't lose half we  think anyone caught driving  without car insurance  should have their vehicle

[01:16:30]  strike against glee but i don't even  have to worry about it no no you  don't approve of that do you i  not have the pictures no what  have you missed in the last few  days because you don't get  certain channels thanks to cable  vision i have no idea whatever's  on fox and my nine i haven't seen  so for my nine a lot of low and  a week at this point right what about  e-rock yeah it's been a week wow  e-rock have uh cable isn't he  moving because uh e-rock guys been  on the phone with his landlord and  making sure he gets fios you  because a lot of time he does he's  got so much time to wait simpsons fan 
[01:17:00]  right oh god check out morning  joe show why hold on a minute why are  you distracting us with your phone  call sir jim michigan what hey  hey guys yesterday morning we had on  morning show and he with him and his  little cohorts there were just going  off on npr about the firing of juan  williams and it was just it was so  sanctimonious because he got imus a  slot now in fairness i guess scarborough  defended imus at the time but the rest  of them didn't i think scarborough was a 
[01:17:30]  stand-up guy to the imus situation it  was keith overman uh who is the  biggest douchebag he's just a cunt to  ever be on tv because he didn't stand  up for uh freedom of speech on his own  goddamn network and had a lot to say  after imus was fired instead of saying  it when the whole thing was going down  oh yeah that's why by the way i don't  respect that asshole at all yeah he's a  bit of a fucking phony he's a phony  pitbull but i believe scarborough was  kind of standing up for freedom of  speech so yeah i may have to start  watching this glee but that cunt that's 
[01:18:00]  on the show with him was uh all over  the imus stuff the second time around  she was just all over about how he  should go away forever who was  that cunt that's on the show with  scarborough hey you know i was watching  the whole juan williams thing last  night and can we pull what bill o'reilly  said at the top of this show because  it was bothersome he's sticking up for  juan williams but then he i i need the  clip i just need the clip after other  people that say maybe outrageous 
[01:18:30]  stuff they should be fired for what  they say but he shouldn't be fired  because he was saying something that is  more legit as much as i want i want you  guys to hear the club and because i i  was thinking about our show when i  heard this and and what you guys would  think of what bill bill o'reilly said  like he doesn't stand up for everybody  as far as freedom of speech goes just  certain people and i think that's a  little weird too and if i i think this  guy's firing was despicable although  technically if they were across the 
[01:19:00]  board the way they say they are i would  respect the firing because they say  look he's a news analyst they're not  supposed to appear on shows with  pundits they're not supposed to offer  opinions like that not i understand  that but to me they're such a leaning in  one direction and it's because it was  about it if he was a muslim oh yeah and  he came out and said look sometimes when  i go through tsa i feel uncomfortable  because i feel like they're gonna target  me as a muslim and it can i why was he  sounding like a jew i don't know  why was he talking to me as a muslim i 
[01:19:30]  don't know what sometimes i eat kugel and  i go through you're right i really was a  horrible impression it was a terrible  impression it sounded jewish a little bit  let me play the whole juan williams story  so everyone's up to speed okay yeah and  a bunch of people on instant feedback are  just typing a dd yeah yeah we'll get the  same thing we'll get to john jeff  eventually  so where am i going wrong there one  well actually uh i hate to say this to  you because i don't know this is what he  got fired for okay he was on bill o'reilly 
[01:20:00]  doing his uh doing his thing so where am  i going wrong there one well actually uh i  hate to say this to you because i don't  want to get your ego going but i think  you're right i think look political  correctness can lead to some kind of  paralysis where you don't address reality  i mean look bill i'm not a bigot you know  the kind of books i've written about the  civil rights movement in this country  but when i get on a plane  i got to if i see people who are in  muslim garb  and i think you know they're identifying  themselves first and foremost as muslims 
[01:20:30]  i get worried i get nervous  i remember also that when that times  square bomber  was at court with i think it's just last  week  he said the war with muslims  america's war with what is just beginning  first drop of blood  i think there's any way to get away from  these facts but i think they're people  who want to somehow remind us all as  president bush did after 9-11  it's not a war against islam  he president bush went there isn't any  theology involved in this at all from my  perspective one but you got fired for 
[01:21:00]  that  wow that's the world we live in  npr  is fucking and here's why you know they're  despicable  because i think it was the kind that runs  groups  i think it was uh  the head that came out and she  apologized or he apologized the guy  apologized for the statement he goes  he should keep his views between him  and his psychiatrist yeah yeah she said  that too like he's crazy he said that  because when you sit on a fucking plane  and you see someone in muslim garb uh 
[01:21:30]  you don't take it a little extra look  you don't look when he goes into his  carry-on when you're at 35 000 feet and  he goes up into his a little uh a  carry-on compartment and grabs a bag  of course you're not looking and seeing  what he's getting out everyone is i  actually feel more comfortable with  them because nobody is going to do it  dress like that logically but as a  muslims yes i do but you're gonna look  yep you absolutely are majority of  people are gonna look at the muslim arabic  looking guy on the plane you're gonna  look at him like i just want to keep an 
[01:22:00]  eye on what he's doing the white people  running npr apparently no don't feel  that way maybe they fly private i don't  know no but the npr lady said that  he's he's not supposed to be giving  his opinion but it was argued that's  not an opinion that's a feeling which  is which is definitely different yes  but he's on a show with a pundit right  which is i mean the opinion part of it  would be well this is how i feel and  you should feel this way too that would  be more of an opinion right he wasn't  pushing it he was he was just saying  when he got he was being an honest  man right yes he was being an honest 
[01:22:30]  man and he got fired for his honesty  and he even said it's not you know it's  not logical it's not it's not a though  the way it should be that's just the  way he feels but are we shocked by that  helen thomas was fired because she gave  an unpopular opinion about fucking the  palestinians should have that homeland  the jews should get out this one guy was  fired because his opinion was unpopular  who else just got fired sanchez shouldn't  have got for rick sanchez asked his  opinion not a big fan but he got fired 
[01:23:00]  he should not have been fired what he  said someone else too recently when  asked the opinion gave it right and and  it's it's amazing how we're punished  for our opinions it's disgusting phony  country they obviously wanted a fire at  one williams and they were just waiting  for him to sort of you know slip and  that was what they decided to go with  that's correct that's just crazy because  again if he was a muslim guy saying i  feel uncomfortable that tsa targets me  and uh you know i feel if he was giving  that type of a feeling which does not 
[01:23:30]  go uh anti npr's ideology they never  would have fired him for that and  they're lying if they say they would  have unbelievable man it's fucking  you can't give an honest answer and  when you're asked that's the worst  thing when you're asked your opinion  you were just minding your own  business and you give it cases right  yeah oh they're showing the video of  the photo shoot too hot girl i don't  go for that is this glee show good like  what is the show everyone's talking  about just trashy everyone's talking

[01:28:00]  had a vote yeah oh my god at the close of  at the close of the meeting the vote was  nine to seven yes she was a lunatic oh  was she uh in the book uh in the book  because she had big tits when mcmurphy is  choking her he ripped open her shirt to  expose her big tits oh her big tits like  just as such a humiliation that her big  tits were exposed really the book was  written from the chief's perspective so  you know that he's better no the book 
[01:28:30]  bite it's ken kesey right it's good but  the fucking movie is a workable what  about the basketball scene he just wants  to play a game of these lunatics the  best is when he goes uh hit me and he  fucking martini throws the ball you  threw the ball into the fence martini  he goes backwards into the fence and  just stiff arms it  that is great murphy's so annoyed all he  wants to do is get out of this  statutory rape thing yeah he had like a 
[01:29:00]  couple of months left he fucked a young  uh 15 year old you know 15 going on 35  yeah 15 going on 30 when my mom was  younger and stronger nurse ratchet oh  really that's what i really yeah that  that that that that god why i'm saying  this on the radio i'm such an idiot it's  just that cold yeah i can stare and that  holy shit she means business crap and it's  utter manipulation oh yeah it was so i have  a tough time watching that movie just  like hoarders oh really but i love the  movie i i get past it because that movie 
[01:29:30]  is just we're talking about one floor  with the cuckoo's nest obviously do you  notice after billy gets laid he stops  stuttering he's fucking kneeling there  oh yeah and uh she's like aren't you  ashamed he's like no i'm not no and then  she threatens him with his mother and he  punches his dick and kills himself as  any of us what of jesus what an asshole  got some stinky on your hangdown as  otto would say that's the great otto  peterson would say got some stinky on  your hangdown every time i've heard george  say that i'm gonna get some stinky on my  hangdown that is a great line i don't 
[01:30:00]  care for that it's just a little vulgar  that should be the name of a cd  uh wow okay where were we talking about  glee i think ah yeah then we got past  that so glee is a good show for who what's  it's teenagers but it seems like a lot of  women are watching it too no it's a lot  of girls like it it could be girls  teens tweens and then even into the  20s straight guys 20 straight guys not  so much not so much it's not a lot if  they got shit like this going on but  they don't well it's the type of show  that a straight guy watches because he 
[01:30:30]  likes it but he doesn't want to admit it  so he says you're watching for the  chicks no they don't shut up you're  just saying that so you don't look like  a fuck no i said it's the type of show  that people would do that i would  never say that that's not me what do  you watch it for i find entertaining  why what's entertaining about it what  is it sam's all about pop culture yeah  he's not his own no you think so he's  not his one he knows all those songs you  could be about pop culture and not sit  there as a fan of this show and watch it  what are you doing what do you like  about it when it comes on what are you 
[01:31:00]  excited about to see go i wouldn't  watch it from the beginning of an  episode but it's the type of thing  jess watches it regularly there's the  backpedal right there just watches it  regularly anytime you get the guy  saying that well she watched it so i  had to watch it but i had the same  thing with buffy i i usually would  agree with you on this point but the  problem is that sam and jess only have  one tv so they're forced to kind of  watch the nagel vision the nagel tron  you call it the nagel vision and i've  been to his his apartment which is close 
[01:31:30]  to a hoarder's apartment by the way but  he wants to make fun of eric sam has a  bunch of his own piles in his place i  don't have a lot of space and you  don't have a lot of space so he can't  even like escape the tv he really can't  you know what though you got a  computer i do but i'll sit down and  watch glee i'll check it out sit and  watch glee i will i'll sit down and  watch it i say oh maybe i won't walk  away from during commercials do you  and just talk about what just happened  and like that last segment like oh i  can't believe this or never i can't  believe boy no boy i don't get it's 
[01:32:00]  gonna happen i don't get it back from  commercial i don't get into it to  that extent and hundred dollars if you  can name one character right now from  glee if i can i ain't making a bet  because i can't name one all right  sam name i'm not for a hundred dollars  but name the cast i can name one  character  cock suck i don't think that's a  character from glee get back to the  hot chick this is a question for jimmy  if she had the hpv would you eat her  box i would probably just say to her  you got you got not not you got you got 
[01:32:30]  nice hair on a boat the famous dr  scanlon mr harding hell he names them  all as doctors but he won't give  harding the doctor title yeah that's the  best dr steve hell dr scanlon the  famous dr scanlon the famous blithering  idiots mr harding i love i love when  fucking harding goes up and he goes now  chesie he's trying to take the wheel and  he goes i'm the skipper of this boat now  chesie and he's hitting his head hitting 
[01:33:00]  his little hat off i'm i'm the skipper  of this boat i'm the skipper i gotta go  watch this he was so angry and we've  talked about see that the scene with  jack nicholson uh passed out next to the  old amazing scenes ever it's always so  ever every time ever you feel for you're  like just wake the fuck up you and will  samson get out yeah right that was  filmed i dare i say beautifully and he 
[01:33:30]  and then he goes he just cares too much  about stupid billy bibbit yeah he cares  too much about this guy and then you  realize how much he helped all of them  because at the end they're all playing  cars normally they're not shitting on  each other they're all like ace of  diamonds one of the you know i think  harding was trying to deal like he  fucking helped them tragic fucking  flick the best best love it okay  gonna see that again one of the  greats yeah pop that one in all right  why don't we uh move on i don't even  know where it's oh one williams and um  glee and it's amazing johnny glee i'm 
[01:34:00]  talking about cuckoo's nest like it's  fucking avatar and just went on the dvd  i liked avatar but i mean yeah you can't  compare the two well i know that's a  man you want to talk about a  masterpiece one flew over the cuckoo's  nest is ain't nobody jerking off  motherfucker yeah that's a true  masterpiece what are you doing i'm in  here hiding with your ass where's that  big no talking motherfucker he wants  the chief who's that big no talking  motherfucker it's always that big no  talking motherfucker i love that  scatman yeah somebody goes no scatman 
[01:34:30]  movie somebody goes where's turkle and  then one of the other crazy people  goes i think he's jerking off and then  he gives away that he's in there ain't  nobody jerking off motherfucker  turkle what are you doing in here  hiding with your ass and then they  fucking the nurse leaves and all the  fucking the whole office has been  torn apart and fucking one of them is  looking at the medicine and the  fucking thing and and he goes my job  you're fucking up just get out  because the guy is still poking around  in the medicine cabinet his underpants 
[01:35:00]  it's my job you're fucking up  he's the greatest really mr turkle lost  his game that's not a bad character in  that whole fucking movie oh my god  fucking devito christopher lloyd it's  just endlessly great martini one of the  characters in glee is named britney s  peers which we found out in the  britney spears episode because she  didn't want to sing a britney spears  song oh her name was britney s peers 
[01:35:30]  again now let's go to the top screen  yeah and we got the glee star apologize  for gq photo shoot it wasn't a real  apology it was kind of a sideways it's a  fake apology go she was and that was  kind of a you should be parenting and  shouldn't have this magazine in your  hands you know season one she was  pregnant on the show i am that's right  blonde and look at how many times  they're showing these pictures look at  this where are kids gonna see uh these  pictures more on tv like this every day 
[01:36:00]  or in a copy of gq tv thank you anthony  those it's fond fox the lunacy of this  is is indescribable yeah most kids would  not have seen this shit no they wouldn't  now all they have to do is look up at a  tv today and yesterday and all weekend  long and they're gonna see it and why  picture why is it okay if the news shows  it why isn't the parents uh whatever the  fuck they're called the ptc in the house  philia why don't they go out to see it  at fox news and uh there's glee right  and the rest of them they were just  showing that the chick in the photo 
[01:36:30]  shoot got divorced you hear talk about  a divorce and the guy's like uh what  happened and she's like he put frogs in  my bra and then the interviewer's like  very interesting  what happened to you miss candy  when they're in the bathtub yeah the  the frogs in my bra i don't remember the  bitches and turkle is like uh  they're very interesting  uh yeah there's nothing wrong with 
[01:37:00]  twenty-somethings in their bra and  panties no the kid in the wheelchair  joined the football team  what what what what stop it i like  that one the way they wheeled the kid  out within the wheelchair to make a  touchdown uh oh yeah the other day  all the other fucking players are  riding him yelling banchini old horse  all day long all day long so the ptc  guy will certainly be on some of these  new shows and just before he talks i'm  sure they'll show the clip so he'll be  part of this whole thing now this is  why is that okay he's why is that 
[01:37:30]  okay  could one person explain that to me  well i'm watching the uh video  just right there cracking before he  crosses the goal line  on the scoreboard  they put a little helmet on him  touchdown dylan galloway  really the kid on glee has more  mobility than that kid  touchdown even the other teams  congratulate this is all the manila lions  are running out on the field to give  that young man congratulations this is  another side works going on i think 
[01:38:00]  it's fireworks he's got he's in a  wheelchair they were being nice what  are you bob kelly now all of a sudden  but you know the guy all teared up  no i'm not teared up that's just nice  i'm not saying we should point a little  lump of shit  thank you the lump of shit of the poor  little fucking paperweight jesus christ  the kid has one good moment in his life  tackle the motherfucker what about  america's competition we're shitting on  him oh my the other teams they all  show some humanity and we're like 
[01:38:30]  these faggots they should have  clotheslined that i'm not saying we  should blindside tackle the guy but  there's gotta be something else you  could do for this would be really  funny if right at the one his wheel  starts spinning in some mud  or dude it would be the greatest  footage ever if some animal ran across  and fucking skull blocking and  tipped his chair over  yes just sprawled him out on the one  two wheelchair races at halftime  danny what are you saying is that  bother you or it's kind of sad  it bugs the piss out of me why 
[01:39:00]  because it  why is a fucking wheelchair kid on the  football team in the first place  it's because of shit like this that  the country is just a collection of  pussies  fags  you know why do we need to let  wheelchair kid have a fucking  touchdown  how about you don't make the team  yeah yeah  you don't make the team because  your fucking legs don't work  but he's not gonna make any team  ever  he can  start fucking figuring out math in  your head like uh  like fucking steven hawking yes  he figured out the universe by 
[01:39:30]  blinking  there has to be a balance here  between the country's going down  the commie tubes and we've lost  all humanity  the boy can move nothing he blows  into a tube they fucking hand him  a football and they gave him one  good moment a fake moment in what  will be a life of shit  and we're shitting on him  he has a life of shit  and they give him one good moment 
[01:40:00]  it's fake they should have fucking  it's a fake moment though  let him let him let him  but to me is is really crossing  what did that accomplish  let him really try  let him really try to make a  touchdown  let him be the center of attention  that's what I say  where does it end though  where's the line  if you get the line is  your kid could score a touchdown  common sense I think  like I think most people  have common sense  where we understand the difference  between coddling  a kid who's just not good enough  and a parent's not wanting  to accept that  and a guy who blows into a tube 
[01:40:30]  and has a life of shit  ahead of him  he has a life of shit  what a retarded kid  as much as I love to tease  and fuck the retarded  who doesn't  who doesn't love a dumbbell  eating candy  while you stick your dick in him  or her  whatever  it's not even gay at that point  what do you mean  how  oopsie  like all of a sudden  having a kid in a wheelchair  on the pole vaulting team  isn't exactly out of the question  anymore  yeah yeah now  oh look at him  there he goes  and oh  it's not about  and then he'll roll over  a fucking tube 
[01:41:00]  and everybody's gonna clap for him  and hoist him in the air  and give him a medal  well maybe but  how about water skiing  I'm not a fan of the fake moments  I mean something like that  if you want to spotlight the kid  you can do it in a different way  is what I'm saying  like that is just so hacky  I don't mind  you know  watch the documentary  what was it called  murder ball  yeah  that's  you want to be impressed by  you know  guys with disabilities  like autistic three pointer kid  I like that  because he kicked fucking ass  and he actually was in the game  he has skills  and he did it 
[01:41:30]  they were defending him  did this kid have to fucking try out  like what  what kid didn't get a spot  on the football team  because fucking  I bet none  yeah I don't think  I don't think  he took his spot  he didn't think  I don't think  he took his starter  no he didn't  he was starting  can't we just  come on be on my side  but let's say the whole team  what did any of them accomplish  by fucking  when you think about it  they fucking  someone hands him a ball  and they run it across a line  and some fucking pederast  blows the whistle  and his hands go up 
[01:42:00]  and they feel good  it's condescending  it's the whole thing is shit  it is condescending  so if you can use it  to make some fucking lump  whose life is awful  feel good  then to me it's nice  but does it make him feel good  or is he just bumbling along  I just don't feel like shit  he was happy  yeah he's not gonna be  fucking those cheerleaders  that the quarterback is  in the NFL  that's different  but you know  once in a while  you gotta just be fucking nice  you should do this  half time  I'll give it a whirl one day  half time you put him  you know  in the center of the field  all by himself 
[01:42:30]  you put a Roman candle  on his head  you light it  maybe a spotlight  on the kid  right  and then you run out  a pair of pristine cleats  and just put it at his feet  and see what happens  for the next 15 minutes  pristine  pristine  it makes everybody feel good  when you're not  it's almost like saying  I don't mind  you give someone like that  a moment  but that's  the hacky fake moment  I'm not a fan of  there's gotta be something else  they could have done  is all I'm saying  sometimes the humanity  is more important  like when you look at  Babe Ruth's last speech  or Lou Gehrig's last speech 
[01:43:00]  at Yankee Stadium  hilarious by the way  they were funny  but like people  like if you look at it logically  like people like  why the fuck are we listening  to Babe Ruth  he's not  he was a player  and he's doing nothing now  so fuck him  he shouldn't even be here  you can't make the team  go fuck yourself  you made the team  we paid you  you're done  it's almost like  you know there's a place  where you gotta have  some kind of fucking  stuff like this  is really insulting  I think too  because they always pull this  when like it's a blowout  or anything like that  if you want to have some integrity  put the kid in  during an actual play  put him in during a real play  when it's a close game  let him stand across 
[01:43:30]  from a lineman  stand well  and see who the sick fucks are  on the other team  you give him the ball  up the middle  and see who is the sick fuck  who is the one  that's going to torpedo  this motherfucker  as he's moving up the field  closer to the goal line  no one's going to do that  I don't think  you know what  so why don't you do  put it in when it's a tie  pull that shit out a tie game  not when it's like  a fucking football blowout  like 48 nothing  I'd have a little more  respect for it  honestly it doesn't even  bother me  I don't even know  what I'm saying  I don't really carry the way  I just wish it wasn't 
[01:44:00]  like a fake hacky moment  it's an unimportant thing  what they're doing  running a ball across  a thing  it's fun to watch  and I admire guys  who can do it  because I can't  but when you look  at the importance of it  making a guy  whose life  is a piece of shit  feel good  is more important  than any of them  fucking running  that fucking  cunt ball  across the thing  he could have  bought him an ice cream cone  he would have had  the same level  he couldn't have eaten it  he would have looked at it  until it melted  unless he lived in Alaska  what was he gonna do with it  fucking put a straw in it 
[01:44:30]  it's either breathe or eat  and now you know  that's all he's  fucking talking about  to everybody  you know what  shut up  you know what  Jimmy turned me  dude he can't even  tickle his own toes  I'm fine with it  do you understand  I'm scratching my bag  he'll never do that  Jimmy you won me over  what am I doing  you're absolutely right  it's about  it's the  who gives a shit  in the end  but that to me  that to me  does not make  the country soft  this kid will have  a picture in his room 
[01:45:00]  of his moment  caring for this kid  who's got a horrible life  does not make  is not  the feminization  of the country  not keeping score  and letting people  who are fine  and healthy  make teams  that they shouldn't make  is different  than having a  fucking humanity  for somebody  whose fucking  life is horrible  and all the  Manila Lions  are running out  on the field  to give that  young man  congratulations  it'd be funny  if a sniper  started firing  at them  they're all  running out  to him on the field  to show him  what working legs  look like  a sniper 
[01:45:30]  started firing  and then they  all scattered  and left old  Lumparoo  sitting there  by himself  they put a helmet  on his head  good luck  just wait it out  yeah put a helmet  on each knee  four yards  on the touchdown run  four yards  four yards  what do you want  touchdown run  right  roll  yeah  it was nice  the other team's  happy for him  yeah are they  yeah  and with 455  left to go  in the ball game  it's 47 to 6  47 to 6  the team's awful 
[01:46:00]  they put the kid on  wait it was a shutout  before that kid scored  no it was 41 to 6  and they were beating  them so bad  to like put stupid  on  now they don't  get a stupid  no they were winning  47 nothing  and he scored  their only  I know  I was kidding  I'm sorry  they blew the shutout  yeah they blew  the shutout  shutouts are pretty  impressive  you're watching  the high school  football game  of the week  brought to you  oh yeah  are we  look at this 
[01:46:30]  this one nice  moment  he's hanging  wrapped in a chair  he's got a life  of loneliness  and not banging  chicks  not driving  not fucking  jerking  all these weird  little things  I don't mind  if they give  somebody who's  really got a  shitty life  all right  you turn me  they should have  put him down  at birth  they should just  fucking wheel him  around the dumpster  of planned  parenthood  show them what  it could  what could have  been  you turn me  fuck him  fuck this punk 
[01:47:00]  that's whatever  it's a lovely  little moment  boy  good for him  the kid's a prick  and he's faking it  he just wanted  the score  he's lazy  he gets out  of the chair  just friggin bolts  over some people  torpedoes them  does that fucking  end zone dance  and he gets back  in the chair  he wakes up like  the awakenings  people  runs a 440  very quickly  and then he  collapses like  Leonard 
[01:47:30]  trying to build  things  shaking like an  asshole on his  date  how humiliating  takes her to the  takes her to the  fucking cafeteria  you asshole  been asleep for  40 years  go get your dicks  like behind a shrub  maybe you can  go out with me  not if you're  shaking like that  you embarrassment  fucking  what are you taking  holy shit  you don't give him  fucking ritalin  serious  robert  oh hell dopa  dopa  oh it was great  he woke up  he was fucking  great for a little  while

[01:54:30]  look like it's  cell phone footage  or something  and then as he's  sort of being  almost arrested  he pulls out a pink  dildo  and starts poking  the cop  and everyone's like  holy shit  you gotta see this  video  it's amazing  yeah the cop  allows him  to reach into  his jacket  right  and then he pulls  out pink panties  and puts it on the cop  and then now the cop's  like alright  I gotta arrest you  and as he's bending  him over  the guy that had  the pink dildo  is now sucking  on the pink dildo  and looks right  into the camera  fake fake 
[01:55:00]  fake fake  and then he  the cop gets mad  throws the dildo  down and walks  away with the guy  handcuffed  yeah where's he  going  that was stupid  and then it fades  out  it's such fucking  but people buy into  this like it's a  real video  it has 800 views  I had a run in  yesterday  with a cop  yeah I'm not sure  what it was  tell you the truth  with a pink dildo  no  wait wait we got  Cheech  that's a great teaser  oh okay yeah  we got Cheech  on the line  remind me of that  Cheech  how are you man  hey welcome to

[01:57:00]  man it's really  good we're  doing a lot  of different  stuff that  we've never  done before  on stage  really  new stuff  yeah  new stuff  from our  catalog that  we've never  done  you know  a lot of  music  a lot of  talking to the  audience  and it's  up close and  personal with  Cheech and  John this time  dancing  it's like  Bollywood  you know  Bollywood  who's not  seeing Cheech  and John  at the beacon  tomorrow  if you're  in the area  dude I would  love to see  those guys  tomorrow  freaking  legends  hey you guys  man like  you don't  need the  money so 
[01:57:30]  you're just  kind of  doing this  because you  dig doing  it  speak for  yourself  I can't  need the  money  so  Cheech keeps  pretty busy  I know  Cheung  has done  a few  things  I've seen  you on  TV  and stuff  but  Cheech  you keep  pretty busy  though with  acting  don't you  yeah  I've been  doing it  all the time  I just  finished well  last season  Lost  yeah Lost  he was in Lost  oh my god  he had a huge  part in Lost  yeah I didn't  watch Lost  he was Hurley's  stepfather  yeah  great job 
[01:58:00]  I didn't think  the show was  going to be  anything  so I didn't  watch it  he didn't  think the show  was going to  really catch  it didn't  really catch  on  you must have  been disappointed  he had a  big part in Lost  he really  he had a great  who left  you were Hurley's  dad not his  stepdad  or were you  a stepdad  that was his  dad  oh that's right  you're the one  that got him  fat by leaving  yeah exactly  he's like  yeah exactly  how far  when you guys  would get those  scripts  how far 
[01:58:30]  did you get  the whole script  or would you  only get your  little section  which you were  going to do  you got the  whole script  I wasn't in  the very last  episode  so I was  kind of  right in the  last one  before you  so I didn't  know what  was going  to happen  yeah  everybody  bugging you  I kept  picturing the  idea that  Hurley's dad  was behind  everything  yeah you  got to think  that like  hey maybe  it's me  maybe I'm  like the  head cog  pin here  and then no  it's nothing  then I just 
[01:59:00]  came out  in Machete  with Robert  Rodriguez  and that was  great  yeah Rodriguez  and Tarantino  really seem to  like you  yeah  they're only  human  put you  in some  great stuff  one of my  favorite  characters  was in  Dusk Till Dawn  which you  played a few  characters  but the  Border Patrol  guy is  great  because when  you're looking  in the  bathroom  and what's  her name  there  she's got  her pants  down  you're looking  at her 
[01:59:30]  panties  the way  you shut  that door  and for  the last  possible  second  you could  still see  your eyes  looking at  her panties  that's  fantastic  yeah  that was  method acting  yeah  that was  really good  big pussy  little pussy  tight pussy  stinky pussy  that guy's  name was  Ted Pussy  was it  yeah  check the  credits on  that one  so you guys  are getting  along good  on the road  is it like  the old  days  or is it  like  is it  more 
[02:00:00]  I guess  corporate  now you  guys get  more people  around you  or how  does it  compare to  the old  days  well you  know what  we have  around  as more  as family  my son  Joey  who's a  DJ  who's a  big DJ  in San  Francisco  convinced him  to come  on the  road with us  and he does  the DJ  set  and then he  handles all  our lights  and sound  and then  Tommy's wife  Shelby  does about  20 minutes  before us  she's a  comedian  and then we  come out  and then  they come  out and help  us during  the show  as well  so it's  a real  family deal  it's nice 
[02:00:30]  for traveling  with them  that's cool  you guys  doing the  bus thing  no  we're planes  I know you  have the money  for the plane  and all  I was thinking  just seeing the  country in a tour  bus would be  cool  you know I've  seen the  country  he's way  past me  fuck that  it's not  worth it  right  how many  I'm sorry  I just  feel like  you know  like  I sing  country western  songs on  the bus  that's all

[02:01:30]  wow  which means  they weren't  alive the last  time we were  on stage  wow right  that's pretty  cool  amazing  it's been  great  and then  we get  them all  over the  spectrum  it doesn't  matter  whether  they're  young  old  Republican  Democrat  Tea Party  it just  doesn't matter  everybody  smokes dope  that's a  great fucking  campaign platform  we can all  agree that  smoking dope

[02:04:00]  get me  some food  of course  hey  are you  surprised  by the  longevity  you guys  have had  like the  fact that  people still  want to  come out  and see  you  were you  nervous  about it  all  when you  first  started  going  back  out  no  I knew  we had  an audience  because  everybody  comes up  to me  every day  hey  when are you  getting back  together  when are you  going to do  a movie  so  but  no  but I  was really  shocked  about the  unhomogeneous 
[02:04:30]  nature  of the  audience  it's like  everybody  if you  like  butter  you like  Cheech and  Chong  what's the  most annoying  thing fans  do  there has  to be  one thing  that fans  do  that you're  like  right  already  oh god  I feel  guilty  because  I've  gotten  one  with  both  of  you  and  then  I  had  you  sign  it  I  really  am  the  annoying  asshole  do you  get tired  of taking  photos 
[02:05:00]  well  you know  it's like  everybody  is  media  everybody  has a  cell phone  you can't  walk out  down the street  you know  everybody  can you get  a picture  yeah  you used  to  have to  have a  camera  and then  meet  somebody  on the  street  and most  people  didn't get  autographs  really  yeah  so it  was like  now  everyone's  autographs  anybody  wants  autographs  you want  a picture  sure  what's  worse  than when  a guy  hands  his chick  a cell  phone  and she's  fumbling  with it  it's like  an ape  operating a  computer  how do you 
[02:05:30]  not know  how to do  this  oh yeah  it didn't go off  can you hang out  down the street  and he's  and he's got  his fucking  arm around  you  and he's  like  oh  this is  kind  of  gay  right  it's  like  ugh  I feel  a sign  like  I act  like  who  is  that  or the  worst  is when  they  like  I don't  mind  taking a  photo  with  somebody  but the  worst  is when 
[02:06:00]  they  come  up  to  you  and  they  go  hey  look  I'm  going to  be  really  gay  and ask  for a  picture  it's  like  dude  it's  just  a  photo  you  don't  have  to  qualify  it  by  admitting  you're  not  a  homosexual  and  then  just  say  no  yeah  I  don't  think  you  want  to  give  me  head  because  you  want  a 
[02:06:30]  great  you  know  what  the  funny  thing  it  doesn't  matter  what  political  persuasion  you are  everybody  loves  Cheech and  Chong  last year  we were  in Detroit  and drunk  white guys  in suits  were trying  to get  on the  stage  what  the fuck  is that  about  what  do they  want  I don't  I'm  maybe  to do  our  accounting  or something  weed  alright

[02:07:30]  they're going fast  very cool man  thanks a lot  thanks guys  take care guys  alright  bye  there goes Cheech  and maybe Chong  I'm not sure if Chong  was there at all  they'd probably trade off  like you do them tomorrow  I'll do them Monday  I don't blame them  because Chong could probably  do a Cheech impression  yeah  those fucking guys man  they're road warriors  fucking legends man  first comedy CDs  I was buying  was Cheech and Chong  when I was a little nothing  Cheech gets a lot of work  though man  still  he's all over TV  and movies  like I said 
[02:08:00]  Rodriguez and Tarantino  love the guy  they put him in everything  hey can we get back  to the pink dildo  video for a second  yes  Will P in Rochester  I wish he would call the show  because he's really mad  he writes  you guys think everything is fake  drives me fucking crazy  do we  we don't think everything is fake  but when it's obvious  that it is fake  we have to call it out  exactly  I guess Will P saw the video  and enjoyed it  and laughed  and whatever  that's fine  but I'm telling you  it's a fake video  it's Will P  so what  why do you have to brag  about that  oh Will P  oh boy 
[02:08:30]  oh boy  hey uh  uh  yeah  cop  cop yesterday  oh we're back to Anthony  and the cop  on the way home  on the way home  midtown tunnel  accident in the tube  I heard it on the news  and made a quick turn  for the Queensborough Bridge  so I go up to the bridge  and there's cabs  on that bridge  all the time  and they will reach  speeds in the tens  of miles an hour  I don't know what that's about  do you know what that's about  I have no idea 
[02:09:00]  they're in the left fucking lane  I know it's a bridge  whatever  get the fuck over  and then you come down  by Silver Cup Studios  I take the upper level  and they got those  two 90 degree turns  one to the right  one to the left  sharp  yeah yeah  sharp turns  now you could take those  pretty fast  as long as you cut the apex  it's fine  I agree  I do it in the escalate  I agree  I've done it  most people are able  to do it right  the cabs will get  next to each other  and you gotta jockey  for position 
[02:09:30]  so you can cut across  a couple of lanes  it's easy to do  there wasn't a lot  of traffic  but these cabs  will be right next  to each other  slow down  to 10 miles an hour  to make this turn  and the other turn  I'm livid  because I know  I'm gonna miss  the green light  at the end  of that long strip  in the trench  it's a timing thing  it's all timing  so I fucking  jockey  I see a spot  I'm in  I'm out  I fucking  goose it  eight cylinders  cranking 
[02:10:00]  I make the light  great  I make the first right  that takes me down  by the school  over there  you go first right  first right  I go third right  first right  or second  technically second right  under the expressway bridge  make the left  now when I'm waiting  at that light  to go under the expressway bridge  this fucking  or I'm pulling up to it  it's two lanes  I love this  because it's so local  I know exactly  where you are  in your mind right now  it's split up now  into two lanes  this is not a single  fucking lane 
[02:10:30]  of traffic  two lanes  I go into the right lane  now because it's open  I go left  always  no left was plugged  up with a garbage truck  I wasn't gonna be  behind that  up the little hill  yeah yeah  no no  before I made the turn  yeah before the turn  under the expressway  you go right lane  before you make the turn  right lane before the turn  the left turn  yeah once that  light turns green  I'm gone  I go left  so this cab  comes over on me  he's coming right over on me  I have to beat my horn  I gotta go on the shoulder  and I'm like  you motherfucker  I roll the window down  I'm cursing this motherfucker  out like crazy 
[02:11:00]  what does he do  when you're cursing  that's it right there  it's two lanes  uh oh  it's two fucking lanes  are we google earthing  we're google earthing  look  it's two fucking lanes  isn't that two lanes  motherfuckers  yes it is  I was in the right lane  this cab comes over on me  can I interrupt you for a second  you ever get on that road  where we are right now  on google earth  and one of those fucking trucks  pulls out  because they just unloaded  into one of those warehouses  over there  now sometimes you gotta go up  on the sidewalk  that's when I sidewalk drive  yeah you gotta sidewalk drive  that's my sidewalk driving place  sorry  so I'm in the right lane 
[02:11:30]  and I'm cursing out this cabbie now  calling him a savage  and just being fucking  really nasty to him  because he's an asshole  and I go to make  now I'm making the left  I go under the expressway  and I make the left  wait let Danny do it  Danny's gotta catch up  this is just fucking  catch up  creepy man  catch up on google earth  wow  and I make the left  alright catch up  come on Disney  that looks like you're escalating  I know that could be me  right there  I make the left  right there by that pole  this car 
[02:12:00]  a little piece of shit  yeah yeah  a little piece of shit car  with one of these  Kojak bubble gum  lights on the dashboard  pulls right in front of me  and cuts me off  and now it's blocking  all traffic  cars are beeping  so the passenger window  rolls down  there's a Hispanic guy  in there  and a black guy  and the black guy  starts yelling at me  he goes  you're driving very recklessly  you're driving recklessly  I could write you  summonses  that you get  many points  on your license  and I go  first I went 
[02:12:30]  I go  who the fuck are you  you said fuck  who the fuck are you  where's my fucking money  it was a simple fucking  where did he come out from  he was next to me  in the other lane  okay  so I went  I went wide  because I'm in that right lane  he got into the left lane  somehow  and cut right in front of me  so he pinned me  between the curb  and his car  enough where I rolled  my window down  and his window  was next to mine  his passenger window  so I'm like 
[02:13:00]  who are you  he goes  we're officers  I go  I go  from where  I go  let me see some ID  and the guy pulls out this ID  that kind of looked  but I've seen  believe me  I've seen enough  NYPD IDs  I wasn't buying  that this guy  this guy was either  a traffic agent  or a taxi and limo  a cop  but he had no fucking  jurisdiction  to pull me over  or to fucking  write a ticket  it just wasn't  going to happen 
[02:13:30]  so I'm telling the guy  the fucking cab  was an asshole  you're driving  he goes  I saw you  from the time  you got over the bridge  you're driving recklessly  you're tailgating  and you  were not using blinker  and I went  ah  I always use my blinker  I don't care  whether you're driving  recklessly  or not  what is that badge  up top  that one  no no  I don't know  what that is  whatever  okay  I  guy was  some kind of  traffic agent  or fucking 
[02:14:00]  taxi limo  I wasn't buying  him as a cop  no fucking way  and  finally  we had so much  shit behind us  beeping and  going crazy  but I wouldn't  give in  I'm like  the cab  it was his  fucking fault  I said  I don't care  if I was driving  as you say  recklessly  that cab  came over  and almost  hit me  you are  driving crazy  and you should  he goes  why the rush  what's the emergency  I go  I want to go to sleep  see it's New York  we're all in a rush  we're all in a rush  we don't know why 
[02:14:30]  but we're all in a rush  so he finally just tells me  to drive safer  he's going to write me up  and get a lot of points  on my license  he said  and then he goes  and now I go  and now I got to sit there  and can't like pass him  even though I knew  like this guy wasn't  the fucking legit cops  yeah  but I was like  he's going to pull me over  and just be a pain in the ass  to me  can I ask this  you think they might have  been undercovers  and they just didn't want  to deal with writing tickets  first of all  he ain't going to write a ticket  that guy is not going to  get out of his personal  fucking car  with the little bubble gum 
[02:15:00]  fucking light thing on it  and start writing tickets  it ain't going to happen  that area is just packed  because the intersection  the next light  is a fucking pain in the ass  nightmare  that's a motherfucker light  I know that light  that area is nothing  but traffic enforcement  it's nothing but traffic  yeah  that's what he was  and that's what he was  he wasn't going to  he can't  first of all  they're not allowed  to pull people over  they can't pull a guy over  that's not their  fucking job  maybe his shift was over  he was getting back  into his car  he's got the little 
[02:15:30]  bubble lights  so he could get to his job  he had nothing else  in his car  he didn't have any  grill lights  no back lights  it was the little  bubble gum machine  why didn't you chance it  curiosity would have  got the best of me  I would have had a chance  to see if he was real  you know what though  he had cut me  I was just going to  keep going  and he pulled in front of me  and cut me off  you said you didn't want  to pass him  yeah because you know what  I wanted to fucking  just get home  just in case it was real  yeah then he could have  just time wise  it would have been  a pain in the ass  if he decided to be a dick 
[02:16:00]  yeah  I sidewalk on that  part of the road  all the time  because the trucks  try to make that turn  and they plug the whole road up  and then they can't  back up or go forward  so you get on the sidewalk  you go bye bye  well you have to  you gotta pull the sidewalk  move  that's also the road  you went backwards  at 50 miles an hour  I was in the car  yeah yeah reverse  when we were going  to the strip club  with Earl in the car  that was an amazing  yeah  reverse at 50  I could have used that footage  in a film  oh I know  and I so wanted to pull that  I so wanted to pull that move  where you step on the brake

It's in the ballpark. 
[02:21:30]  You don't even know.  Now that you guys got me a job, I gave him more Bruce shirts.  Ah, yes.  I pre-ordered the Darkness album because it was like $150.  Why?  What?  It's a special edition.  What's special about it?  You get a free t-shirt and poster.  Big fucking deal.  For $150?  Jimmy, how dare you?  What?  This is what you do with Kiss and Black Sabbath.  Oh, that's true.  It's just a different band, that's all.  Yeah, but it's not the band I like.  So fuck out.  Roland, but you should understand where he's at with his obsession for a band. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, I do.  Okay, good.  Roland, how long have you been gone from the show?  Unemployed.  It was like a year and change.  Was it that long?  Yeah.  And catch everybody up.  It was too damn high.  You look good, though, since the Fort Hood shootings.  Yeah, we weren't commenting on that.  What have you been doing?  Fill the people in on what your life was like for about a year. 
[02:22:30]  A year of contemplating on losing weight.  Didn't happen.  Yeah.  A lot of TV.  Yeah, you watched a lot of television.  A lot of talk shows.  A lot of chick flicks.  Chick flicks?  Yeah.  Remember, he likes the chick flicks.  Oh, right.  What did you like?  The Josh DeMaule movie was pretty good.  The what?  The new Josh DeMaule movie.  Life has been a way.  What is it?  It's a chick flick.  It was really good.  It's not good.  What was the story, briefly?  Basically, they have a best friend that had a kid. 
[02:23:00]  They die, then...  Oh, right.  And they have to step in as the parents, even though they're not in a relationship.  And then they fall in love.  Of course they do.  How predictable.  I had a tickle.  I forgot about the time.  You know, action, suspensions.  Yeah, suspensions.  Been going on interviews, and that's pretty much it.  Been going on interviews?  That's what I was doing for the past year and a half.  What were you trying to get... 
[02:23:30]  What were some of the jobs you were going for?  There's one at MTV.  It took like seven months of interviews.  Wow, really?  You going for the Jersey Shore?  You know, Roland Carm.  So that didn't pan out, and then the call came in to return.  Yeah, the call came in here, yeah.  The bat signal went up.  Everybody was very grateful here, so...  Grateful.  Grateful, or nice, and all that.  It was supposed to be gracious.  Gracious.  Grateful would be if you came in and they went,  Thank God you're here.  That's funny, Roland.  Did everybody here was grateful? 
[02:24:00]  Totally get the message wrong.  Grateful and gracious really do mean two different things.  How great would it be if he was fired this afternoon?  So you are going to be booking guests here for the program.  Yes.  Can we maybe hint, even if you've got to maybe leave out the name, just maybe, who are we looking at here as far as getting some guests?  There's a couple coming up.  I'm trying to lock in and confirm.  Trying to lock in and confirm? 
[02:24:30]  A-listers, would you say?  Yeah, I'd say A-listers, yeah.  Current, people would be like, wow, that's current, they're working.  Yes, this guy's filming a sequel to a big blockbuster film.  Oh.  A hangover tour?  Yeah.  That's it.  Oh, look at Jimmy.  By the way, when I saw Gerard Butler, we did a lot of together.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Gerard Butler's a big friend of Roland.  I was talking to him about Roland, yes.  I was talking about Crazy Roland, but he likes you a lot.  Yeah, I emailed him, and he said, he goes, oi, I'll see you boys soon. 
[02:25:00]  No, it's amazing.  I'd like to have him come in, that's for sure.  He's coming in next year.  No, it's amazing about Roland, you think he just bullshits his way through life, and then you do meet people he talks about, and they all have nothing but things to say about Roland.  They all know him.  Right?  Things to say, not nice things.  Oh, no, nice.  I should say nice things.  Once I got a job, David Duchovny called and said he'll see you guys in January.  See?  See?  David Duchovny.  We've always had a great time with David Duchovny on the show.  If you weren't hired, he'd be here in December.  But since you're here, he's putting it back a month. 
[02:25:30]  He wants to avoid Roland.  He wants more Legos.  That's right.  First kid.  Obviously, a couple of people not with us anymore here.  Steve.  Steve C. has moved on to greener pastures.  And, of course, our security guy who you got along with oh so well.  Did you get along?  Oh, no.  Remember some of the fights?  Remember some of the fights that went on?  Sorry, your dog died. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, man.  Roland?  I try and swamp people to see if I can see him once in a while.  Yeah, man.  You don't want to fuck with Roland.  No, Roland's vicious.  No, Roland was vicious.  Roland has another side of him that's scary.  That was one of the first times we saw it, too.  Like, Roland's very mild-mannered.  Do we have that?  We haven't played that in a while.  And he unloaded on Mastipo.  It was really funny.  And that was the first time we saw you really kind of come out of your shell.  Yeah, that one and Eastside Dave.  That was one of the two.  Eastside Dave. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, were you friendly with Eastside Dave, though?  No, no.  You two didn't really.  And he's gone, too.  Look at you.  And his wife hasn't forgave me for that comment, yeah.  Really?  I haven't apologized, though, but I won't.  And you won't?  No.  No.  No, why would you?  You got along with Steve?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  So I thought maybe there was some kind of conspiracy going on.  No, no, no.  Roland makes people disappear.  Can you get Jesse on the show?  Probably, yeah.  That one, no.  Yeah, I don't think so.  That one, Roland. 
[02:27:00]  Jimmy wrecked that for us.  I think everyone, yeah.  We know you're good.  I'll just say that Jimmy will be sick that day.  And then I go, oh, my God, he's here.  No, it was great.  It was great.  I'm glad.  Good.  I could watch the show and see what an idiot he is.  We could just put sound clips on and make fun of him.  I could care less if he comes in.  He's Jesse's T or Gene Simmons.  Neavy Seal.  Yeah, yeah, Gene Simmons.  I feel the same way.  Keep him out.  I'd be fine with it if he came back, but if he doesn't want to, it gives a fuck.  Yeah.  It's irrelevant to me.  Do you like the corporate environment around here, Roland?  Yeah, I mean.  It's different, right?  Yeah, it's different, but everybody's been nice, so.  That's good.  That'll stop. 
[02:27:30]  That'll end.  That has to start before it stops, by the way.  Yes.  The thing I do like about it is that the other shows here, it's like, it is, the XM building  was a little lonely.  Like, this is actually, you know how you're just saying hi in the hallway, but at least  there's always people around, which I kind of like.  I liked the loneliness.  Sometimes.  I liked people being able to just come up without having to go through a battery of security.  We had that scumbag downstairs at the fucking XM place.  Yeah, but he was a building guy, so we could tell him to go fuck himself. 
[02:28:00]  With the tie.  Yeah, that guy.  Oh, the pedophile.  That piece of garbage.  I hope he's dead.  I hope fucking, I hope Will Sampson threw a fucking concrete sink on him.  Or smothered him with a pillow.  But the things I liked about the other plays were the fact that we could throw the windows  open and demean the guy sweeping in front of the director's guild and call him a piece  of shit.  That was fun.  Remember him?  Getting in the argument with the guy that would sweep the sidewalk in front of the director's 
[02:28:30]  guild?  God, yeah.  You don't think the mustard incident was the greatest incident ever, though?  Mustard was fantastic.  It was dumping mustard.  Who were you trying to hit?  The stick guy.  Yeah, the guy that had the stick.  What was it?  The toothpicks?  It was a matchstick.  What the fuck was it?  Danny, help me out.  Yeah, he had the toothpick art.  Of David Letterman or somebody?  He had a bunch of things that day.  And we had it with him, so I decided to take mustard and squirt it on him from the fifth,  sixth floor.  Yeah, he left and we were watching.  He had some Asian gentlemen who was just minding his business, coming into work. 
[02:29:00]  That was the same day that Fred from Brooklyn decided to hip-check him into the side of the  building, but said it was okay because he made eyes at you from sixth floors up.  I didn't know that.  So you guys were on the same page?  This is the first I'm hearing this.  Box of cocks was great.  Homeless fishing.  Homeless fishing.  We can't do that.  Oh my God.  What was the other one?  Nigga or Nazi?  Who would get picked up by the cab first?  That video's hilarious.  Did you say street fishing? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, street fishing.  Yeah.  That was just some great shit.  We could do it from here.  Five thirty-six floors up.  Five dollars.  The homeless half a whole face photo op to get his tumor removed.  Five dollars.  There was so much shit that went on because we were alone and we were able to just hit  the street.  We were trying to dupe people into thinking that we were walking around with Bono.  Yeah, the Bono guy wore a button when we almost got fired because a girl passed out  and paramedic showed up. 
[02:30:00]  Yes!  Oh God, that was so funny.  And I fucked one in what became Ron and Fez's office without a condom.  Yes!  You bet I did and I came all over the place.  Before it was Ron and Fez's office, it was a sex room.  Otherwise, that was the sex room.  I fucked a half-passed out Asian girl.  Poorly, I might add.  Remember the drunk naked girl that tried to leave by window?  Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she was walking around thinking the window was a door.  And that was the day where one of them was completely naked on the sidewalk crying for 
[02:30:30]  her mommy, basically, as everyone was coming into work.  Ah, the good old days.  The first week of our new jobs, basically.  Yeah, this is different here now.  I just want to let you know.  Yeah, let's be careful now.  You went to Starbucks and harassed Starbucks.  Oh, God.  Oh, your Starbucks comedy.  The Starbucks comedy where Voss would go in and just do three minutes.  And Rue 57.  Yeah, Rue 57.  He was funny, too.  Yeah.  Well, Ron's back.  Congratulations.  Thank you, guys, for everything.  So good to have you back with the team. 
[02:31:00]  Thank you.  Exactly.  I'm, too.  Looking forward to your next Springsteen shirt.  Yeah.  It'll be Monday.  Monday.  That's an old one, right?  It's like the limited edition one I bought for $80 at the concert.  Then now I went online this summer.  It's $19.  Ooh.  Not very limited.  No.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Hey, are we going to get Michael K. Williams and Jamie Hector together?  Their schedules are separate.  We'll get them separately, though?  Mm-hmm.  That's okay.  I thought we can get them together.  Yeah.  But that's okay. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  All right.  Roland's back.  We're going to take a break in.  Because we still have to do...  You're not going to believe this.  We still haven't done John and Jeff.  We haven't finished Jocktober.  We started this three hours ago.  We started...  The first thing we were doing today on this show was Jocktober.  Because we always do Jocktober in the 9 o'clock hour, so I'm trying to mix it up a little  bit, and unfortunately, we did not do a good job of that.  And we have Sam Shit from his mom, Bobby.  Sam Shit.  I want to welcome, of course, Joe Curry.  Joe.  My pal is here.  Where are you going to be, Joe?  I'll tell you this.  Get up to a mic and plug your goddamn gig.  I didn't even know Joe was here until I heard him laughing back there.  Plug your goddamn gig. 
[02:32:00]  I'm going to plug my goddamn gig.  My goddamn gig.  Reading this like demands.  I will be at the comedy shop tomorrow.  I'm headlining.  That's right.  45 minutes of me.  A brick 46 in Rockaway, New Jersey.  973-625-4900.  Can I see that flyer?  Oh, no.  See Joseph Curry.  He's my pal, and he's very funny.  Damn it.  All right.  Joe has got a fucking hat in his...  It's kind of a cool picture, actually.  I'd love to trash you, but it's a good shot. 
[02:32:30]  Let me see the shot, Joe.  Oh, it's the burglar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's walking on a...  You look very fucking scary there.  And you're with Thomas Dale, who looks like he had his fucking head shot taken in a park  with a sprinkler going...  What was he, an old Yellowstone?  And fucking Sean Morton.  Who is this fucking...  He looks like every fucking male nurse that smothers an old lady.  Who are these fucking creeps you're working with?  Creeps.  Fucking Thomas Dale looks like he just got out from fucking extortion. 
[02:33:00]  What a fucking...  What a hitman he looks like.  It's called the Parole Show.  Look at Thomas Dale.  That is good.  With a fucking sprinkler going on in the back.  And I like Sean Morton's clothing.  It looks like Kirk in the Rathacon.  It's a color headshot.  He's trying very hard to be jovial.  Fucking weirdo.  You know what he is?  He's like in a fucking wedding hall somewhere.  That fucking shitty ceiling wedding hall light behind him.  Oh, I want to fucking sit this Sean Morton down and talk to him. 
[02:33:30]  And Thomas Dale.  You need a more distracting background.  You know what, Thomas Dale?  He should have his fucking headshot taken on a roller coaster when he's going under something.  Holy shit.  I'm sure maybe they're very funny guys.  Yeah, sure.  But it doesn't matter.  They're damn funny guys.  As in, you guys, I'm looking very disapprovingly at James at this.  Oh, of course.  It's the headshots though.  They have to know their headshots are awful.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't get headshots in your daily life.  Go somewhere. 
[02:34:00]  You don't have a friend with a camera snap one while you're fucking...  What was Thomas Dale looking at that he's so nasty?  Who's going to hire you?  We need to laugh.  Let's hire that guy.  The one in the park who's leering his children in the distance.  Thomas, you've got to look happy.  And Sean Morton with his little head tilt.  Like, I'm just a big guy who smiles a lot.  Yeah, he's fun.  Oh, that pederast.  He's the life of the party.  He's hosting.  I don't know these guys.  Where are they from?  Jersey, I believe. 
[02:34:30]  Jersey.  Jersey guys.  All right, cool.  Maybe.  And it's Brick, New Jersey.  Yep.  930.  Where is Brick, New Jersey?  Oh, it's that south, right?  No, it's actually, it's Brick 45, but it's actually in Rockaway, New Jersey.  Oh, Highway 45.  Maybe you should go to a luminous siding, Jersey.  Yeah, right?  Maybe get a whole bunch of Brick to...  But I mean, I can't sign.  And by the way, it's Brick 46.  Yes.  Brick 46.  You said Brick...  You were off by one Brick.  I fucking hope Brick 45 sells out, and there's no one at Brick 40. 
[02:35:00]  I hope Brick 45 is some kind of a creepy, like, male dance with you.  All these fucking O&A mullet guys show up.  See a bunch of fucking fags and fucking bikini briefs dancing.  And you're performing to three people.  One Brick off.  Oops.  Brick 45.  All from a flyer.  All from a flyer.  That's it.  God bless you, though.  He's headlining finally.  Yes.  It's about time, man. 
[02:35:30]  Damn right.  Yes, Joe Curry.  They get some cash or no?  A little bit.  Getting there?  Yeah.  All right.  Aren't we doing a gig, too?  We're doing...  What are we doing?  Bar 9.  Brick 44.  Brick 44.  Oh, you sure it's not Bar 10?  What a smart ass.  The way Joe thinks of my playing, he wished it was.  When is that gig?  In November.  Friday in November.  I was wondering if it was the same day as E-Rock's wedding.  Oh, shit.  Just say yes.  I think it is.  Just say yes. 
[02:36:00]  19th?  I think it is.  I think it is.  I think it is.  I think it is.  E-Rock, of course it is.  Of course it is.  You're blowing off E-Rock's...  I think it is.  You're blowing off E-Rock's wedding for...  Hey, it's a Bar 9 gig.  Bar 9 gig.  Oh, Bar 9 gigs are legendary.  Supercedes all other commitments.  Yes, of course.  You deal with my brother if you don't show up to a gig.  No, man.  What the fuck?  No, man.  No.  No, man.  What the fuck are you doing?  And especially...  Total lack of fucking dedication, Anthony.  Exactly.  And when your brother used to smoke, and when he would quit, he would be like a lunatic.  He'd call me up.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, foot.  Yeah, what?  It's so cloudy out, man.  All right.  If you don't want to be in the band, just let us know.  You quit smoking again, huh, Joe?  Yeah, off the cigarettes on you, Joe.  Wow.  No.  What the fuck are you playing?  What the fuck are you playing?  The song?  I fucking got it down.  It's completely down.  No, it's fucking wrong.  Oh, that time.  No.  I really know this is right.  And then when it turns out that you were right, and Joe was wrong, it's like, yeah.  All right.  Well, fuck you.  Things happen.  All right.  One, two, three. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, yeah.  I am so hanging out with the wrong cool man.  Oh, I hate you.  I'm hanging out with the wrong cool man, man.  Joe is brutal to work with.  Let me tell you, I play in a band now, and now we're never, and the guy that leads, it's  very good, but he could be tough, and he apologized to me about one rehearsal, and I go, you don't  know who I worked for for 30 years.  Yeah, yeah.  You're the frickin' Easter bunny.  Joe, I didn't know Joe had it in him.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  That's why he's successful.  I'd be at work the night before rehearsal, or the day before rehearsal, I'd be at work where 
[02:37:30]  I'm supposed to be in a house doing something with the tape in my player with the  music to a song, just trying to write words for it, because I knew, if I came in without  words that night, Joe was just like, oh, what'd you do?  Oh, no fucking vocals?  Great, great, good.  Total lack of dedication.  You know, what the fuck is wrong?  Holy shit, Joe, calm down.  How about the time when we were recording the Apollo CD?  Yeah, yeah.  And we had to write a bit.  Me and Ant had to write this bit. 
[02:38:00]  And we're outside the studio, and Joe walks up, how's the bit coming?  And, well, you guys have been fucking drinking, haven't you?  He looks at me and Anthony and goes, you guys have 15 minutes to be the funniest motherfuckers  on planet Earth.  Uh-oh.  And we did the bit, though.  We did the bit.  Which bit was it?  And more beers.  Oh, what bit was that?  It was the...  You see how funny and memorable it was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Obviously, it was a real fucking home run.  A real hoot.  Oh, God.  I forgot.  Not one of them.  One of them.  Oh, come on, Joe.  See, he was half jokes. 
[02:38:30]  God damn.  We'll take a break.  We'll hang with foot a little bit.  Cool.  Sure.  Pump up his gig, and we'll do some Jacktober.  Jacktober!  And we'll look at Sam's old hair, finally.  I want to see that.  From his mom, Bobby.  I hear it smells.  I think E-Rock's going to have to smell it.  Yeah, we'll do all that shit.  And by the way, I have a shit brewing.  Oh, do you?  Oh.  Coffee shit?  What kind of shit?  A too much dessert last night shit.  What'd you have for dessert?  Cheesecake.  No, we had a...  What did he eat?  What's the whole dinner?  Because you know how we love...  I love the combination.  We had the healthy fucking thing last night.  We talked to the priest about... 
[02:39:00]  You went to that place?  No!  Oh!  I went to Porter House.  Porter House!  That's the complete opposite.  With a fine chamois.  Why, you son of a man?  I had a filet mignon.  I had an appetizer of six delicious oysters.  Nice.  Which I sucked down.  Yeah.  I sucked them down like they would come on a shell.  In other words, like a gentleman.  Like a gentleman.  Like a gentleman, yeah.  And I had those. 
[02:39:30]  And I had a salad...  Endive salad.  And I had a medium-well filet mignon with no extra oil.  And some...  Some meat shit.  Brussels sprouts.  Oh, man.  Meat shit and Brussels sprouts are coming out.  But then my girlfriend wanted dessert because she's slim.  Yes.  And I'm like, yeah, I get what you want.  I'll have some of yours.  So we chose...  We couldn't get the apple pie because it had like alcohol and the raisins or whatever.  So she got the chocolate tart.  Oh.  And, um...  Black Earl?  So I had... 
[02:40:00]  We split that.  And they were supposed to bring...  It's a funny story.  They were supposed to have a raspberry sorbet with it.  But then I said, can we have vanilla ice cream?  Because I like raspberry sorbet.  Of course.  And the lady goes, well, I'll bring one of each.  But she forgot the raspberry sorbet.  She only brought the vanilla.  So we split the...  We split it all.  And I said, you know, I have a hangering for another little bit of ice cream.  Oh, wow.  And then the lady came over and she goes, well, would they come in threes?  So we said, well, we'll have three scoops. 
[02:40:30]  A maple, a chocolate, and a vanilla.  So she brought us that.  And I guess one of the waiters was a fan.  So the chef threw in a bunch of cookies.  Oh, my God.  And I literally ate until I had to swallow and then go, whew, before I bit again.  I had to breathe.  Out of breath.  Yeah.  And then I fucking stiff-legged home.  I didn't even fuck her.  I was like a fucking...  Yes, you did by going out to dinner with her.  No.  She was tapping my arm like De Niro at the end of Raging Bull.  And he's about to get fucking arrested for statutory rape on my fat stomach. 
[02:41:00]  And I did not fuck her.  Stiff-legged at home.  I stiff-legged at home.  And the shit is now a-brew-in.  Right now, you know what it is?  It's the first day of spring.  And the whole nest has woken up.  You should probably get your iPhone and record.  Yeah, could you do that for us?  I would love to hear it.  It'll be a hard...  I didn't drink enough water shit.  It's going to be like one of those where you go...  I don't care if I just hear a plop.  I want to hear something. 
[02:41:30]  I might wait till...  What time is it now?  Oh, wow.  I could probably wait till I get home.  No, let's...  You don't understand.  In high school, my nickname was the shithole didn't care.  Oh, look.  Yeah, the ladies love me.  What are you doing?  I got a date with the shithole didn't care.  And I would kneel on the side of my bed and suck my shits back in.  What a fucking loser.  Suck your shits back in.  I used to look forward to getting home and fantasizing about being a superhero or famous or about girls. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  And I would fantasize.  I would kneel by my bed in prayer form for hours and hold my shit in and just zone out looking up at the ceiling.  And what?  Like daydream?  Daydream.  That was how I daydream.  Or about...  I would always dream about being hurt in front of the whole high school and bloodied and beaten and then the girls loving me and hold my shit in.  You've got to share more of these stories.  You're a fucking mental patient.  I love it.  You're completely insane.  What would you, like, clench your butt cheeks real tight to suck your shit in? 
[02:42:30]  I would literally...  I would be like...  You can watch them all the time.  Yes, I want to see.  Jimmy is kneeling in prayer form by one of the chairs.  I would be like, I'm up like this.  And sometimes I'd be like...  He's lifting one leg up sometimes to suck your shit in.  Why, if you were home, why didn't you just shit?  Ah, that is the question, isn't it, Ant?  Why, Jim, did you kneel and suck your shit back in like it was a tail?  I don't know why.  Why did I want to hold on to my duty?  Was that like the energy for your daydreaming?  I was Indian giving my shit. 
[02:43:00]  It would come out a little.  You'd turtle head and then suck it back in.  Do you understand?  It was time to shit when my next fucking breath was going to put on the back of my ankles.  I knew it was time to shit when I literally would have to unbuckle my pants standing up  and push them down straight because I couldn't bend over your shit.  If you'd bend over your shit.  I literally...  But I could never sit while I was holding my shit.  Why you would do that.  And I'm sure Dr. Steve knows, you know, holding fecal matter stimulates the prostate. 
[02:43:30]  There's something about it.  It's very right for a lot of men.  Which is why I'm in business.  Put a glove on my finger.  Stir your shit like it's Lipton's iced tea.  I wonder why nobody wants to shake my hand or high five.  I'm like, ah, fecal matter.  Holy shit.  Goddamn.  The Cigars and Scotch says you were taking whack-a-mole shits. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, puxitani shits.  Six more weeks to enter.  Six more weeks to enter.  It's a control thing, I think.  That's an odd thing to do.  I can understand holding your shit in if you're in a fucking prison for a few hours.  But you're home.  Do you understand?  Holding shit my whole life, when I shit in my pants in, like, second grade, and Kelly  Howell, who I had a crush on, smelled it and went, did you go poop soon in your pants?  And I was like, yeah, right.  Which I had.  You didn't lie.  Yeah, right.  It smelled like I would go home with rusty shit in my pants almost every day. 
[02:44:30]  You were the stinky shit kid?  Literally, until I was a teenager, I was cleaning shit out of my underwear.  My mother stopped doing it when I was 12.  Didn't everyone know that you were shitting yourself, and did you become scorned as stinky  shit as pants kid?  No, I didn't.  I mean, I wouldn't always shit my pants, but you always knew by the end of the day.  What happened is...  It only takes once in school.  The shit would come out, and I would literally, I would have to sit in class on my right cheek,  and the shit would flatten against my ass cheeks and be cold.  At what age? 
[02:45:00]  Like a crepe.  All the way up to 12?  A crap crepe.  A crepe with crepe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Up to 12 years old.  But I was holding shit much longer than that.  I've rediscovered it recently.  Oh, have you?  Oh, what I've been missing out on.  You're edging with shit.  What's that about?  I don't know.  We gotta get a psychologist.  Hopefully it's not the desire to be fucked in the ass by something brown.  Yeah.  Maybe I just love my duty and hate giving it up to the cold, cold world.  Jimmy hates the direction it's going in.  Did your mom really clean it out up until 12 years old? 
[02:45:30]  Well, she would do the laundry, but then she would complain about my shit underwear,  and I would have to just, I can't remember distinctively just sitting there fucking cleaning  like a chocolate tart out of my fucking underwear.  Oh my god, damn.  I had problems.  I don't get it.  Yeah, it's not normal past the age of two.  Yeah.  Aw, she's developmentally disabled when you're having fecal matter build up.  That is amazing.  I couldn't imagine not going to the bathroom like that. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, it's weird.  I guarantee you it's got something to do with prostate stimulation or something.  Oh, really?  I think it's something sexual, of course.  That's why I can't even take fingers in my ass, because it makes me feel like I have  to shit.  That saved me from AIDS, because believe me, there's no way.  I wouldn't have taken dicks at one point.  I would have had to.  Shit feels so good.  Look, all kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful, but I just can't take them.  I don't know. 
[02:46:30]  I think there's a one-way door there.  Holy shit.  I don't know how.  I don't know.  I just know.  Even a prostate exam is just not fucking good at all.  That fucking thing is not good.  Shit coming out, you sit there and go, ah.  Yeah.  A finger going in is, ah.  It's terrible.  Hey, we have Paul Masson on the phone.  Dr. Steve is calling in.  Yeah, Paul Masson.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve.  We will piss and no wine before it's time.  Sorry.  But he's not a psychiatrist or a psychologist.  He's an all-around guy. 
[02:47:00]  He's not even a doctor.  He's just some fucking weirdo from Tennessee.  Dr. Steve, Jimmy was shitting his pants well up until his, I don't know, what, 12-ish?  Yeah, I heard.  I was jerking off to the segment.  Hi, buddy.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  Hey, buddy.  Have you ever heard of this?  Oh, yeah.  What Jimmy had was a thing called encopresis.  Of course.  Nice.  Encopresis.  Encopresis.  And what it is is a little kid that usually starts at a young age, they'll hold in their 
[02:47:30]  duty, and you can hold it in to the point where the bowel gets so distended that it can't  contract anymore.  And when that happens, the only way shit will come out is by piling more shit on top of it  and forcing it out.  Sounds like our material.  I knew something was there.  Wow.  Is that a diamond bullet that was? 
[02:48:00]  Like our material.  You know, what's it called?  Encopresis.  Encopresis.  A new word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yo, that's my sister, Encopresis.  Encopresis.  I drive an Encopresis.  Yes.  Yes, it's very efficient.  I drive it and suffer from it.  And gargle with it.  I'm the cause of it.  Get its pile of shit. 
[02:48:30]  So, Encopresis, what happens at the end after I just kept piling up shit until my body couldn't  hold it anymore?  Yeah, exactly.  And if you lose the ability to detect when you need to take a shit, the nerves just, you  know, that sense the need to take a shit, just go, fuck it.  We give up.  We give up.  No, but I always know when I have to shit.  I always know.  Whenever the flies are gathering on my high knee, I run to the bathroom. 
[02:49:00]  You needed to take a shit long before you did back then because you basically had a  the rectum was completely distended with, you know, hard shit.  And if your parents had known about it and had known what to do...  They would have filmed it and sold it.  Yeah.  Sorry.  They would do a clean-out procedure where you have to clean the whole bowel out.  Usually, it consists of either giving the kid a bunch of enemas or giving them mineral oil 
[02:49:30]  just to empty out the colon.  And once it shrinks back down again into its normal state, then the kid can start to notice  when they have to poop again and not soil their underwear.  But no, no, Steve, I knew I had to shit.  I was holding it in.  I wasn't going to the bathroom because I didn't like to shit in public.  Right.  Well, and that's where the term anal retentive comes from.  Yes.  Because you're retaining.  Yes. 
[02:50:00]  But in the beginning, you did.  But later on, you said until you were like 12, you had to clean shit out of your underwear.  Well, it was because I was holding it in and I was making the decision.  And it would just sneak out.  It would slowly come out of there like the Red October.  And I could have made it to a bathroom.  I could have flown to Syracuse and shit.  I held it for hours.  That's got to be so uncomfortable.  How slowly is it?  Yeah.  That's a great fucking visual. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  God damn it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At least we know the name of it now.  Encoprisis?  Encoprisis.  It may have had something to do with your potty training.  Yeah, I think that's more it.  Well, a bunch of people saying it's Jimmy's literally holding something in.  Maybe one of himself.  You're a shit hoarder inside yourself.  Maybe.  There's something he's trying to hold on to.  Maybe because when my mother was potty training me, she would pinch my penis with her molars. 
[02:51:00]  And scream, dirty boy, make it out.  I'm going to do it.  God damn it.  I would definitely do it.  But yeah, and it could be a control thing, too, or just a fear of being disgusting.  I don't have that fear.  I guess you got over that.  Exactly.  Jesus, I turned it into Lavoris in my later life.  Well, of course, and then we would compensate for that as we get older to try to balance it out. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, that's exactly what he's done.  Talk to your psychologist friend to top that conversation off.  Yeah, great.  Dr. Steve, thank you again.  My God, this guy is informed.  He knows everything.  He really is.  Yeah, Steve is great.  I was telling my girlfriend, we were talking about that galaxy they found far away, the farthest galaxy,  how you would be good at explaining time and stuff like that, because Kaku just doesn't do it well.  He gets too weird.  Kaku's become such a hack. 
[02:52:00]  He's just on all those science shows going, I can make a lightsaber, can you?  I don't think you can.  No, you can't.  And who wants a lightsaber?  Yes.  We are going to look into hovercrafts and gravity-defying objects.  Shut up.  A lightsaber.  Last time I had one of those is when my breath stunk.  A Puerto Rican handed me one.  A lightsaber.  Oh, my God.  I said a lightsaber.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:52:30]  You should have handed that one to Chip.  There you go.  Chip refused, and I tried to, and Chip wouldn't say it.  He didn't want that one.  Chip refused.  He didn't get it.  Sounds like anal retentive or something, you know?  Give me 46 bricks, I'll build you something.  Let's let Dr. Steve go.  All right, Dr. Steve, you have a pleasant day.  Are you driving or are you in your office?  No, I'm driving.  All right, be safe.  Dr. Steve, can you hold on the line?  I've got to ask you something.  Oh.  For real?  Yeah.  I want to hear Dr. Steve's car go over those things at the fucking rental car place and 
[02:53:00]  all of his tires pop, but I want to hear that happen when he's doing 70.  Steve, hold on the line, all right?  Okay, man.  Bye, buddy.  Oh, no.  I don't have nothing for him.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  Fucking asshole.  I need dick pills.  Send dick pills.  He's the best.  Can we do a quick break so we can at least do Jacktober?  Yeah, we should do that and then finish up at Jacktober.  Doing a little rolling action, going at a break, because that's how this started, I guess. 
[02:53:30]  It's an ADD show all the way around.  But we're actually going to play a little rolling for you, going at a break.  This is the best transformation I have ever seen.  Oh, my God.  I should be in a movie.  My condolences.  Opinion 3.  The Opinion 3 show.  Of the virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah, this is the Opinion 3 show. 
[02:54:00]  Damn it.  My funniest line of the day was it on the radio.  Fuck.  Ian Halpern's on TV right now, and we were calling him while he was doing his interview.  I was trying to make him grab his phone, but it's too long for now.  We got Foot.  What's the big gig, Foot?  Big gig is going to be at Brick 46 tomorrow night in Rockaway, New Jersey at the Comedy Shop. 
[02:54:30]  And it's 973-625-4900 for reservations.  And I'm doing a firehouse gig in Wall, New Jersey tonight.  Tonight?  Tonight in Wall, New Jersey at the Wall Firehouse.  What are you doing?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire?  Where's the fire, everybody?  Where's the roof and the floors and the ceiling and stuff?  They got the wall.  I get it, Jeff. 
[02:55:00]  Okay, sure.  Where's Sam?  Way back there now.  Hi.  Samuel.  Jocktober.  Let's do John and Jeff.  Can I play the two guys promo again?  When we last left, this is where we were.  We haven't gotten past this part, no.  The John and Jeff show.  We're two guys who think there is no excuse for poor neighborhoods being dirty.  We're two guys who think any band that comes back after a farewell tour should be sued.  We're two guys who think parole boards should be eliminated. 
[02:55:30]  We're two guys who think children's beauty pageants are comfort food for perverts.  All right, there you go.  We're two guys that kneel by the bed and hold our shit until we have to stiff leg to the bathroom  or each other's mouths.  My kid is here.  What?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy. 
[02:56:00]  Guess radio must run in the family.  That's funny because when you said that, I turned and all I saw was your wife.  It's her birthday today, too.  Is it?  It's her birthday and my kid is here.  Oh, my goodness.  Happy birthday.  There she is.  Who's she walking with?  Her new boyfriend.  That's her friend who served in the army there.  The army?  Did some Iraq.  She hangs out with that guy and you allow it?  He's all handsome and military?  Oh, my God.  I got a big cuck. 
[02:56:30]  Look, she's pushing a little stroller.  Oh, my God.  Hi.  Yeah, let's crack the door open.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Happy birthday, Linz.  Hello.  How you doing?  Let's see.  Let's see.  Come on.  Come on.  Anna's never met my kid now that he's talking and walking.  You got to see the baby.  And he's screaming the baby's asleep.  Oh, that's good.  Hello.  Look at this baby. 
[02:57:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Uncle Paul, sit down.  Thank you.  Oh, little man.  He's sleeping.  Snoozing.  Oh, that's exciting radio.  Yeah, that's great.  Wake up.  How come he's not listening to this show?  Happy birthday.  I was hoping he was awake so I could introduce him to E-Rock, because he'll be his boss someday.  E-Rock.  Oh, damn.  E-Rock.  The kid's going to be your boss.  Yeah. 
[02:57:30]  That's funny.  He's so much younger than you.  He's 31 years younger than you.  The only Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Wow.  Is that how he gets back at us?  I guess.  He throws sweepers in.  He throws sweepers in.  That's a perfect example of the Eric, I've gotten you.  That's the caliber of ripping that you get when you fuck with Eric.  Wow.  He promotes the show.  That's good.  All right.  The kid's sleeping.  So where are we?  Jack Tover?  Maybe he's wearing more grown-up clothing than E-Rock. 
[02:58:00]  See, he does.  See?  And E-Rock's fat.  No one even said anything about how fat he is.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  E-Rock, I'm sorry.  Yeah, exactly.  Put your Darth Vader helmet back on.  And my friend Kevin in the back there, who did some shit in Iraq, man.  Oh, yeah?  Big time shit.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  And he's living in, where are you now?  Dubai or the other joint?  I always get him confused.  He's in Dubai, man.  Oh, you live in Dubai?  I do.  What do you do there for, like, a living?  Consulting? 
[02:58:30]  Uh-oh.  Did you go to that?  He's with the agency.  Yeah.  I think there's something else going on.  He's with the agency.  His job title has been very vague for the last few years.  Yeah, I consult on how to split people's heads open to get information out of them.  Hey, did you go to that new tower in Dubai?  No, I'm going to give it, like, six months, see if it's going to fall first.  Yeah, good idea.  You don't know how they build those things.  I mean, you look at the people who actually build it, and they're all, you know,  from the subcontinent of, you know, India, Pakistan, and they're not trained in the 
[02:59:00]  particular construction, so I'm a little...  Yeah, engineering is a little odd.  Yeah, I mean, it's held up pretty well so far, so we'll see what happens.  Well, there's problems, right, with the electricity and the elevators.  They've already had big problems.  Yeah.  Tallest structure in the world.  Dubai, I've moved to the cell.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You're a piece of shit.  I hope you're killed.  Fucking die in a car accident. 
[02:59:30]  Dubai.  You say goodbye or something, like, you know, make it friendly.  I never know where Chip's going to go.  I don't know, it's unbelievable.  Like to spray Lysol on your goddamn face.  Oh, wow.  Piece of shit.  Chip gets so angry when you tell one of his, kind of his jokes.  Who knew Chip had such a temper?  I know.  Mind your business, two racers.  Oh, wow.  So angry at Chip.  He must have had...  He must have imbibed some alcohol or something.  I don't drink.  Oh, really?  No. 
[03:00:00]  But who are you?  Oh.  Oh, Chip.  You got any Dubai?  Oh, oh, Chip.  You got any Dubai questions?  What?  No Dubai questions?  You want to learn about Dubai today?  Dubai?  If I want to ask you about Dubai, I'll call the older producer.  That's much too good for Chip.  That was me.  I fed Chip one.  Dubai.  I want to go in that tower, though.  I wanted to vacation in Dubai.  I would never want to go to a Middle Eastern country.  Oh, my God.  Really?  That was one I considered.  Isn't that where they fucking hit the guy from Hamas? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Actually, in one of the hotels there, they took out one of the guys in Hamas, and they're  trying to figure out who did it now.  Of course, the first inclination is to blame Israel.  And the side, yeah.  I'm sorry, it was them.  And they were the guys who could pull it off.  Yeah, of course.  Fucking, and they had that big sale hotel in Dubai.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really very decadent.  I want to go there and open a kosher deli.  Fucking, you know, my grand opening, 50 guys with bomb belts run in.  Fucking pastramis all over the streets.  Bad business idea, Jimmy. 
[03:01:00]  Terrible.  And all the construction has stopped, right?  It's slowed down.  Yeah.  Abu Dhabi, which is the capital, actually, to the south, where they have a lot more of  the oil money, it's continued pretty steadily.  And in Dubai, it's slowed down a little bit, but it's continuing.  I mean, with the economy starting to pick up again, it's starting to stop.  What do you consult?  Security.  Oh.  It's so vague.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We don't ask past that. 
[03:01:30]  Are you with the new Blackwater?  No, not.  Oh, okay.  What are they called now?  They are...  They changed their name or something.  Yeah, they did change their name.  Blackwater got a little smudge on it.  Ooh, that company got a little smudge on it.  He's very cute.  Oh, look.  He's awake.  Oh, the cameras are coming out.  Opie has grabbed the baby and now is sitting at the microphone.  He does look very cute.  Oh, that's adorable. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, he's so sweet.  There we go.  I'm giving little waves.  He's in shock.  He just wants to relax.  All of a sudden, he's sitting at a microphone.  We just woke him up.  Watch me, starts blasting out like hysterical jokes.  Wouldn't be my son, then.  There you go.  Worst parent ever.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry, bud.  Oh, God.  Opie doesn't like the contract. 
[03:02:30]  I think I scared him when I laughed.  Oh, yes, you did.  I'm sorry, young lad.  I'm sorry, youngster.  Holy smoke.  Look at him.  He's looking all frightened.  How would you feel?  It is a little too much.  This is like overkill, man.  He's on a spaceship all of a sudden.  Oh, yes.  Oh, you poor little guy.  This is a very strange atmosphere for the little fella.  Hi, little guy. 
[03:03:00]  You're just taking it all in.  Yeah, it's a lot of stuff to look at.  Little blue eyes.  He has very good eyes.  Wow.  Kerber baby face.  Yeah, he's really got fucking cute eyes.  Kerber baby.  I know I'm surprised.  Both of his parents are blonde hair, blue eyes.  I'm like, oh, I'm surprised he's got blue eyes.  Yeah, those are boys from Brazil eyes.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, the Fuhrer would have loved you.  Hitler would have given your family a standing ovation.  Oh, no, it's okay.  He's got Hitler hair. 
[03:03:30]  It's the laughter.  He's not used to the loud, you know, it's too much.  That was too much.  Laughter.  Aw.  Tee hee hee.  Aw, there you go.  Hello, baby.  Hi.  Yes.  Hi.  And Hudson.  Exactly.  Now he's smiling.  You guys have something in common.  You can't put the bottle down.  Laughter.  Oh.  Hello.  Hello.  How are you?  He remembers me.  Adorable.  I'm a hit with kids.  They love me. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll hold him back.  My father was a hit with kids, too.  What's that?  Always hit me.  Hello.  Oh.  Hey, I got no respect, huh?  Oh, look.  Jimmy's holding the baby.  Oh.  They don't look that much different.  Yeah.  Little baby head.  He's very cute.  Oh, he's smiling now.  I told you.  Kids love me.  Yeah.  Kids are smiling.  Shut up, shut up, shut up.  I like the hair there. 
[03:04:30]  That's pretty cool.  It's got like that whoosh going on in the front.  Yeah, see, I cheer kids up.  That's what I do.  I don't baby them.  All right, where were we?  I talked.  Laughter.  Trying not to scare the child.  I know.  That's too much for him.  The obnoxious laugh guy.  The obnoxious laugh, really.  That's a funny line, though.  He's not my son.  And then, wah.  Yeah.  That kid's face crying was the best.  That really was a great baby crying face.  And your line about opening the contract was a damn good follow-up. 
[03:05:00]  That's what you want to do, buddy.  Baby weight is very cute.  The weight of a baby is very cute.  He's looking at Anthony.  Hello.  He just looks right at you, doesn't he?  You guys will be competing for women someday.  Someday?  That's a horrible joke. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, it's time to run the show.  Yeah, he's going to play now.  All right, where were we?  You picking out something for Jocktober, are you?  Yeah, you just got that, that, that, what do you guys call it?  A nook, or a thingy, or a nipple, or a, just don't call it a tiny little penis.  What is, uh, someone in our...  We called it a whoople for my sister or something.  A whoople?  Yeah, something like that.  We just call it a pacifier.  But what's the name they do in Philly?  I forgot, uh, the, uh, it's a weird one, man. 
[03:06:00]  Your grandma calls it a, uh, I forget, whatever.  Probably something horrible.  No, what the hell was it?  Give him a spook chaser, he's crying.  It is Philly.  Yeah.  Hey, give the kid a jig, a boo, he's not happy.  Oh, he doesn't like that.  He keeps crying at the laughing.  No, it's a dimension of blacks, I'm sorry.  I forgot he lives in the whitest family in America.  I'm sorry, youngster.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, that is too funny.  What is it, what do they call it down there?  That's it, whatever.  Jesus.  And then he's back to smiling.  Oh, is that insane?  Oh.  Jimmy's very funny.  That's a good picture.  He's the Flash.  All right.  That's a real baby.  Now that we've completely shut down the show.  We tried to do Jocktober eight times today, and we got to the same point. 
[03:07:00]  I'm starting to think maybe John and Jeff is not meant to be today.  Maybe Monday is a good day for John and Jeff.  John and Jeff.  We should cut a new promo.  We're two guys that fawn over infants.  Real shock jock radio show.  Such a faggot saps we are.  The baby comes in, we're all nice.  It stops the show dead.  We're just like, aw.  Five and a half months.  Baby.  Five and a half months.  My mom would be proud of you guys right now.  Five and a half months.  What?  Because you're treating the baby nice.  You're being nice.  What are we supposed to do? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, we had to throw firecrackers out.  It's a baby.  We think we're monsters?  You called my mom on the phone and asked if she had miscarriages in her freezer.  She's an adult, as are you at times, who appear to be.  I thought maybe she had kept some miscarriages in her freezer.  Just a question.  Exactly.  She needed something to be proud of.  Oh, but that, I mean, the implication.  The implication, yes.  The kid just keeps looking at ants.  It's a view that she's not proud of.  I love the fact that he just keeps looking over an ant.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  Hi.  Checking out everybody.  Yep.  That little head just kind of goes like, look around.  He has very kissable cheeks.  Babies have very kissable faces.  Oh, faces?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Everyone's calling it, it's called a binky.  Well, yeah, we've heard that one.  They call them binkies.  A binky?  Nook.  There's one they use in Philly.  I can't remember.  What is it?  She don't remember.  That's hysterical.  The hair coverage.  Uh-oh. 
[03:08:30]  Where are you going?  You want to play that?  Where are you going?  Oh, he's picking up something.  You want to play that?  We can play that.  You going to?  No, you want to eat that.  He's in his mount.  All right.  The kid's now picking material for the show.  It's going to be better than any show we've ever done.  Sarah Palin.  He wants to make fun of Sarah Palin.  Don't laugh too hard, Jesus.  That is so funny.  He's got very sensitive ears.  We're all deaf in here.  He's not.  He's got the brand new ears.  Brandy new.  And he's got the brand new pump.  When he pees, it hits the back wall. 
[03:09:00]  Very impressive.  You want to just eat stuff?  Don't get MRSA from fucking Fezzy, please.  They're on vacation, I think.  Are they?  Yes, they are.  No pics.  Babies just eat anything.  Kids just like to pick stuff up and just,  ah, this looks tasty.  It's a tasty treat.  Little baby teeth are coming in.  Yeah.  Did your mother save all yours?  My mom, I went over.  Are they in a necklace?  You sick.  See, like, that's a funny joke, right?  Because I went over to my parents' house, 
[03:09:30]  and my mom said she has baby teeth in the freezer.  A hundred percent.  Straight.  She has your baby teeth.  I don't know.  She said she's not a hundred percent sure if they're mine or my brother.  They have to be yours.  She flushed your brothers down the toilet and went,  poo, poo, poo.  You're not my Sam.  Too-y.  She said what she saw.  Too-y.  Hey, Dirk came up with a Jimmy McMillan political ad.  Oh.  Play that.  It'll kill us.  It'll kill a minute here. 
[03:10:00]  That's not a good song.  It is the goal.  What?  It is Friday.  New York is on life support,  rocked by the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Its citizens struggle daily to keep up with the outlandish  and illusionary demands coming out of Albany.  New York needs your help.  Who will you choose?  Andrew Cuomo is too afraid to be governor.  I don't want to be the governor.  And Carl Palladino is a total pussy.  That's not the example that we should be showing our children. 
[03:10:30]  Jimmy McMillan is an ass kicker.  I want to let everybody know something right now.  You cross my line, your ass is mine.  Jimmy McMillan is pro-sex.  When's the last time you laid on your back  and let your girlfriend tickle you to death?  And if a woman grabbed my nest and went to lick my balls,  I laughed my ass.  All types of sex.  I used to be a stripper in a nightclub.  If you're an adult and you need stimulation of somebody  and you can't get it up,  call me to come and I'll dance to you and your wife.  Andrew Cuomo doesn't believe in tickling or ball grabbing.  We won't let it happen in New York. 
[03:11:00]  And when asked if he'd be up for a simple taint massage,  Carl Palladino went completely flaccid.  I don't think so.  Jimmy McMillan is not your average politician.  I want you to go to the beach  and I want you to get butt naked.  I want you to walk the street butt naked.  But he's the right politician for New York.  Read my lips.  Jimmy McMillan is not playing games.  This political ad is complete BS  and should not be taken seriously.  Anyone who does is a complete and utter moron.  Thank you and God bless America. 
[03:11:30]  Not bad, huh?  That's good.  I like that.  Jimmy McMillan.  You've got a new voice guy.  He's great, man.  AJ or one of the guys around here?  Yes.  No, it wasn't him.  No more.  No more.  Steve's Uncle Paul song was great, though.  Yeah.  He did some good stuff.  Yeah, he did.  But he can't do that stuff anymore  because he doesn't have a job.  Oh, Sam.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Sam is ruthless, man.  All right, so your mom's got baby teeth in the freezer?  Yeah, she's got baby teeth in the freezer.  Can you bring that in for Monday?  No, because she showed that is perishable. 
[03:12:00]  How are teeth perishable?  They're not perishable.  They last in skeletons, you dummy.  No, no, no.  Good one.  It's the only thing that they...  Let it go.  Baby teeth don't have roots, so they rot away.  Is that true?  Do you understand that teeth...  They break.  That teeth end up...  When they find fossils,  when they find bones of dinosaurs and cavemen,  there's teeth in the skulls.  Only big boy teeth, though. 
[03:12:30]  What about babies?  Little dead...  I don't want you to know.  No, I don't know.  They're little skeleton, little baby skeletons  they've unearthed from many, many moons ago.  That's right.  What do you think?  Everyone grew up back then.  I guess you're...  No, they could have.  I'd love to examine those baby teeth for cock skin.  Mummified cocks.  Sam's baby teeth.  Yes, I want DNA taken from...  They were punched out by an angry customer.  Sam was suckling.  I do have to tease that the hair really smells, so... 
[03:13:00]  Can we read the hair?  I would love to have E-Rock smell the hair.  E-Rock has to smell the hair.  Yeah, let's get the hair.  Let's do that.  Do you want to do it now or Monday?  We should do it now.  Yeah, we'll get that out of the way now.  While we wait for the hair, I guess Brother Joe's got a gig.  Right.  To you, it's a theater show at the Maryland Theater in Hagerstown, Maryland, on November 6th.  Just go to notu2.com for information, or call for tickets, 301-790-2000. 
[03:13:30]  But just go to notu2.com.  That's all the info you need.  That's perfect.  Yeah, Joe will yell at you if you don't show up.  He actually yells at the people.  He yells at the people.  No, man, you weren't there.  Total lack of dedication to the band.  I'm not in the band.  Yeah, but just shut up.  That doesn't make a difference.  It doesn't make a difference.  I want to hear Joe's side of this story, though.  Oh, please.  I think he's got a good side.  He'll say we're all drunks.  He'll tell you he's right.  Because he goes, well, you guys should have been on the ball.  Yeah, yeah.  Meanwhile, every gig would start with Joe turning to Rex and going, you got a pick? 
[03:14:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, because Joe wouldn't bring picks to a gig.  You know, he's a guitarist.  Right.  Now, as Joe will yell at you, I will not.  So you need to come to the comedy shop tomorrow.  Pick 46 in Rockaway, New Jersey.  973-625-4900.  I have no plugs.  No plugs?  Just listen to my bones.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Who hit that?  Oh, no.  Oh, the little baby's playing with this instant replay machine.  That's not appropriate for a little guy. 
[03:14:30]  What are you going to hit?  Something that gets us fired.  Yeah.  I hope there's something good on there.  Let's see.  What button does he like?  Buttons.  Buttons.  Buttons.  Oh, this is hilarious.  Buttons.  Little baby's controlling the radio.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Hey, come on.  That's too much stuff.  Come on.  Oh, no, now.  Oh, that's inappropriate.  That child's a shock jock.  All right, where's your hair?  We should check this out.  Here it is.  Let's bring it at E-Rock. 
[03:15:00]  Where's E-Rock?  Oh, that's it.  Wow, there's a lot of it.  Yeah.  It's full.  Why is it full?  I thought it was a little lock.  No, I had an afro.  She kept all of it.  She, your mother's insane.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  She's obsessed with you.  She's obsessed with you in a very unhealthy way.  I want to spit my gum in his fucking hair.  Yeah, absolutely.  Don't spit it in.  We will never be able to get it out.  So let's bring E-Rock in and smell Sam's hair that's in the Tupperware.  Are you ready for this, E-Rock?  Yeah.  That's a lot of hair.  Yeah.  And it smells.  It's not even dirty hair.  It's like this weird, bad chemical odor. 
[03:15:30]  Chemical odor?  Soul glue.  It's not soul glue.  Oh, E-Rock's so nailed you because you're black.  No, I'm not.  Why?  You got a problem?  No, no, no.  I don't have a problem.  Well, then what's the matter?  You don't want to acknowledge your history?  I have Caucasian parents.  That's all.  Good luck with that.  Exactly.  You don't think so.  You don't have Caucasian parents.  No.  You have a lunatic and Raleigh fingers.  That's my mom and dad. 
[03:16:00]  Well.  Take it out.  What are you going to do?  All right.  I'm going to take it off.  All right.  Oh, God.  It's like what they find in a shallow grave.  I wish.  With the rest of them.  Let me just look at it.  Looks like pubes.  Yes, it's curly.  You dumbo.  Look at my head.  What crazy person keeps this?  My mom.  She kept it.  Smell it.  That's crazy. 
[03:16:30]  Put your face in it.  Yeah, you got to get real close.  You have to hold your breath.  I'll hold it.  You have to hold your breath for an hour.  Now you die doing that.  Hold your breath and then I'm going to put it right up to your face and then take a deep  breath in.  Okay?  Okay.  Sam's old hair from like 10 years ago.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  The Obi and Anthony show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. </pre>
