<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with E-Rock and Primetime Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of Jocktober" segment, a recurring October feature where Sam critiques other radio shows.  This year's targets were the Rocky and Sue morning show from KRZ in Wilkes-Barre, PA (market 70), and the Rock and Roll Morning Show from WKIT in Bangor, Maine (Stephen King's station).  The segment heavily criticized Rocky and Sue's on-air dynamic, characterized by Sue's constant interruptions and contentious banter with Rocky; their marital status remained unclear.  Numerous clips were played showcasing their interactions, including a sexually suggestive listener poll, a segment about Rocky's day at the fair (featuring a "deep-fried on a stick tour"), a phone call about an out-of-state ticket, and other assorted segments.  The hosts, using crude and offensive humor, repeatedly lambasted Sue's performance.  The critique then shifted to the Rock and Roll Morning Show, focusing on a caller named Marley, who told several jokes.  The hosts discussed the show's style, the personalities involved (Bobby Russell and Mark "the Shark" Young), and its overall quality.  Listener calls followed, with one mentioning an Obama Chia Pet, before the segment concluded with further commentary and a brief mention of the deceased DJ DJAM, who died of a drug overdose.  Throughout the "Worst of Jocktober" segment, the hosts employed frequent sexual innuendo and references to drug use.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about comedian Marley, who had performed earlier that evening.  A major portion revolved around Marley’s story about his 2-year-old son's $800 ambulance ride due to a cotton candy allergy.  The hosts and crew engaged in crude speculation about the high cost, including jokes about a stripper pole and Lady Gaga's hypothetical presence in the ambulance.  They also debated the merits of different Elvis Presley eras for comedy and the appropriateness of using personal stories, especially those involving children, as comedic material.  A caller, Nicole, shared her experience of Opie and Anthony being replaced on a Maine station by "Robin's Zodiac Zone," sparking a discussion about the lack of local appeal of certain shows. Subsequent calls highlighted Marley’s local celebrity status in Maine, mentioning appearances on *The Tonight Show* (the specific iteration unspecified) and his mall kiosk selling merchandise. A final caller, Jeremy, described Marley as a "jackass" despite his popularity, characterizing his humor as heavily reliant on Maine-specific references.  The segment concluded with a preview of an upcoming "Jacktober" segment featuring a contributor named Drifty.  The entire broadcast, across both segments, consistently employed crude and offensive humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the worst of Jocktober.  This is the worst Jocktober, you know.  Oh, this is, okay, let me just fucking read it.  It's the worst of Jocktober, a celebration of craptacular radio  as presented by your pals Opie, Anthony, and Lil' Jimmy Norton  on The Virus, Sirius 197, XM202.  Hi, I'm E-Rock from The Opie and Anthony Show,  and this is primetime Sam Roberts.  That sounded very natural, thank you very much.  You're very welcome.  We're doing something a little different this weekend. 
[00:00:30]  We're not doing the countdown.  We are doing something special.  Yes, normally in this time slot, you hear the worst of the week countdown,  but instead, since it's the end of our favorite month of the year,  we're doing a special worst of Jocktober countdown.  Now, there's a lot of candidates that we have here,  but we had to narrow down to just a choice few.  Well, we should explain what Jocktober is.  Throughout the month of October, I, primetime Sam Roberts,  for The Opie and Anthony Show, go and listen to other radio stations 
[00:01:00]  and pick out some of the worst morning shows I can think of.  Then we bring clips on the air and make fun of them for absolutely no reason.  But it's a good time had by all, except for the people we're making fun of.  And we've made fun of a lot.  We have made fun of a lot.  And today and tonight, we'll be going over some of our favorite moments and clips  from this year's Jocktober.  It's the worst of Jocktober.  Now, a couple of things happen in October,  one of which I'm very excited about. 
[00:01:30]  Jocktober starts.  Now, this is a tradition carried on by The Opie and Anthony Show for decades now.  I think we started our first one 35, 40 years ago.  I thought one.  One?  Oh, we've done one?  Yeah.  Okay.  So one.  So this is our second annual Jocktober.  This is where we get somebody like the likes of Sam  to just scour the FM airwaves to find radio shows worthy of paying tribute to on Jocktober. 
[00:02:00]  You might say, Anthony, what is the criteria for a show that you would pay tribute to on Jocktober,  during Jocktober?  And we are looking for shows that are just adorable,  shows that have that man-woman kind of rapport thing going on,  like, are they married?  Are they not?  They sure act like a married couple. 
[00:02:30]  A little bickering and bantering.  Well, you know, they'll kiss and make up in the end.  Oh, and the woman that's there to just keep him in line,  because gosh knows how that guy could just run wild if she wasn't there.  Thank God she keeps him in check.  Like the Julie and Chip morning show, if that exists.  Yeah, something like that.  Oh, it would be, too.  Would it be Julie and Chip or Chip and Julie, though?  Yeah, Chip, Chip, line, N, line, Julie.  N, Julie.  And then the thing would be some way to wrap her J around. 
[00:03:00]  That is not, you punched in Chip and Julie and got that?  That's Chip and Julie.  Wow.  Julie's the dog.  Oh, my God.  In both cases.  She'd be baldy and mullet.  It's some guy with a mullet, some woman with very thin hair,  and a golden retriever with peanut butter on his nose.  The golden retriever is so bored with these two people.  Yeah, he's had it.  Yeah, he's really tired of them.  He's hoping they're the victim of a wilding in that park they're in.  They're in a nice park, and he's just hoping that some youth has attacked them. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, please.  He should rip their throats out and just trot away.  A little bone in his mouth.  You shoot down, you see his little doggy oven mitts and a little mat.  His red lipstick dick.  Let me see.  What time is it?  We've been talking for eight minutes, and it's already a dog fuck joke.  What happens?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I'm looking at Rocky and Sue.  All right.  Let's go to Rocky and Sue.  Rocky and Sue's web page.  Jesus.  Wow.  That is KRZ. 
[00:04:00]  Rocky Dennis.  Are they crazy?  Is that KRZ?  Because I would think that KRZ is crazy.  Hey, crazy.  I'll tell you this.  For today's Jocktober, we're going all the way to Wilkes-Barre, PA.  Wow.  Yeah.  To KRZ, the Rocky and Sue morning show.  Is that a triple-digit market?  Does that want to be triple where you need three numbers to tell what market it is?  Like Syracuse?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not sure.  I'm certain it's somewhere up there. 
[00:04:30]  But I believe this morning duo has been on the air for like 20 years or something.  Wow.  They're a staple in Wilkes-Barre.  And they may or may not be married.  May or may not.  So they're pulling it off.  They're doing the job.  That's what they're supposed to do.  People go, are they?  I don't know.  They certainly sound like us, hon.  As the emasculated husband drives his minivan with the wife to the grocery store.  They certainly sound like we do.  These are people I'd like to maybe have a dinner party with. 
[00:05:00]  You know, semi-plows into them and T-bones them.  How great is that?  If the last thing they say is, I wonder what Rocky and Sue are going to say about that before  they're fucking sawed in half by a fucking trucker on Crank.  Don't say Crank.  That's not as funny.  Say Coke.  Yeah.  I think crystal methamphetamine, so everyone gets it.  Not everyone knows drug jargon.  It's true.  It is true.  It's true.  I know, Sam. 
[00:05:30]  You can tell it's a successful morning show.  Mm-hmm.  Because in the mornings, Sue is a co-host.  In the afternoons, she is the queen of real estate.  What?  So, yes, she sells real estate in the afternoon.  Oh, cool.  Oh, she's a real estate?  Yes.  I've already done enough on real estate.  Brokers and agents.  Ugh.  They're all out of the same mold.  Yeah.  And I'm sorry if you are one, but it's usually some woman who... 
[00:06:00]  Now, this isn't every single one of them, because I have met a couple of nice ones, but this  is usually the mold of a real estate agent woman.  Uh, a little too old to try to be looking as hot as she thinks she is.  That bleach blonde hair.  A lot of makeup.  Yeah, thanks.  Um, very yappy, and usually drives a big car very fast, because you've got to follow them  from, you know, house to house when you're trying to find houses. 
[00:06:30]  And then they get out, and they just...  I don't know what their job is, first of all.  Hey, here's a kitchen.  Hey, here's a bedroom.  Hey, here's a living room.  I know!  Look, it comes with a fireplace.  Oh, thank God you told me I was going to keep my cat in there.  Oh!  Whishoo!  Thank God for you.  How much?  Same mold.  And she looks exactly like that.  She, although her hair's a little too short, she got kind of a dikey haircut.  And he just looks like, um...  Looks like that Mr. Science guy.  Bill Nye.  Bill Nye the Science Guy.  He's a little older. 
[00:07:00]  His neck kind of gives it away.  Yeah, he should wear turtlenecks.  Rocky and Sue.  Why don't you give them a shot before you start, you know...  Fair enough.  Busting their chops.  You know something, Sam?  You are so right.  You could just see, like...  Because you think a morning show has been around for 20 years, they're probably on the  cusp of very exciting.  It's not like they would just get on the air and talk about nothing at all.  Yeah, yeah.  20 years of experience with each other in the same market.  They probably know all the ins and outs of Wilkes-Barre.  Everything Wilkes-Barre, they know. 
[00:07:30]  That's right.  Everything.  Nothing in Wilkes-Barre gets by them.  No, it's Rocky and Sue.  They've been there forever.  When you're in market number 70, you really need to know all the local angles.  Seventy!  First of all, now I want to apologize to Rocky and Sue.  I said triple digits, and it's 70.  Yes.  Market 70.  When you want Wilkes-Barre, you know who you go to?  Those two.  Rocky and Sue, my friends.  Absolutely.  Well, let's give a little start out.  I guess...  Now, Sam has prefaced some of these clips in his inimitable style. 
[00:08:00]  Rocky starts a poll, the poll question?  Yeah, they got like a poll question where people can call up, believe it, they'll ask  a question and ask the audience to call in with the answers.  Kind of like a, I couldn't think of anything.  Like a poll.  Audience participation, I was thinking.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, polls all the rage because of the internets.  So, and I'm sure Rocky and Sue want to be like on the cutting edge of the intro tubes.  They have a blog, so... 
[00:08:30]  What?  Yeah.  Wow.  So, them doing a poll kind of question, eh, kind of getting into that whole attitude.  I like that.  And then it says, the poll question, but Sue thinks he goes a little far.  Oh, good gravy.  I can't wait to hear this one.  Yeah, you go to a point and then it's like...  Yeah.  It's like, come on, Rocky.  Yeah.  Come on.  But wouldn't it be funny if he really did, like if they were doing a fun poll and then  he just took a shit into like a plastic child's shovel and then started flinging at her on 
[00:09:00]  the air.  Yelling racial epithets.  Yeah, and they're both white.  She's like, what's wrong with you?  It's fantastic.  All right.  Let's hear Rocky starting the poll question.  The Rocky and Sue Show.  On 98.5 K-R-Z.  All right.  The question, one-third of the women polled said they do this right after a breakup.  Okay.  One-third said they do this right after breaking up. 
[00:09:30]  Uh-huh.  What is it?  1-800-222-0985.  Hold on, hold on.  Wow, that's a good question.  Yeah.  See?  Hmm.  How many women?  Two out of three?  Yeah.  No.  I thought one-third.  I don't know, maybe one-third.  One-third said they do this after a breakup.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  My guess is tickle their clit with a rake.  That probably comes a little further down the list.  This seems to be something pretty popular.  But, gosh, if I don't know where Rocky's going with this one, oh, boy, thank God Sue's 
[00:10:00]  there to calm him down, because I think it's going to be something sexual.  Whoa.  I don't know.  It might be, because you would think a girl breaks up with a guy, she's going to want to  get out there and get back on that horse, as they say, or suck its dick.  Oh, God, stop it, of course.  Just shove some feed and oats in that thing and let the horse have at it.  Fill your vag with some little green, crispy apples.  Yes.  It's pretty hard to hold your vag flat, though, so it doesn't bite your hand with a sugar cube. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, very dangerous.  Let's hear what Rocky thinks the answer might be.  What is it?  1-800-222-0985.  First, to get it right, we're going to get you into the Quiznos Spotlight Lounge, week  from Wednesday, starring Jason Castro from American Idol.  Wow.  I'm actually excited to meet him.  I brought this kid Fidel Castro saying, what is that?  Who is he?  He's from American Idol.  He had the dreadlocks. 
[00:11:00]  He was quite the heartthrob.  He got voted off.  Apparently, Sue is all taken by him.  Is he a dreadlocks on a white guy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you know, that's all the rage.  Can we have her response one more time, Dan?  Yes, I definitely want to hear her response.  Tremendously terrible.  Jason Castro from American Idol.  I'm actually excited to meet him.  Yeah, it's Wednesday at 8 a.m.  He's so hippy-dippy California, ukulele, dreadlocked, dude.  You know who he is.  Here's a couple of these.  Oh, my God.  And they put echo on her voice? 
[00:11:30]  Because she sounds like a man, first of all.  She really is like, oh, I really want to see him.  Her sing-y song talking pattern.  Oh, boy.  She's wacky.  Dude, you know who he is.  Here's a couple of the responses we got on our Facebook page.  Lose weight.  That was my guess.  A third of the women lose weight after they break up.  I just think about your own breakups.  What did you do?  One-third of the women polled said they would do this right after a breakup. 
[00:12:00]  Get revenge.  Yeah.  Okay, that'd be part of it.  Sleep with somebody else.  Yeah.  One-third of the women polled said they would do this after a breakup.  Get a Brazilian.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Don't give him any ideas.  1-800-222-1-800.  Why not give him any ideas?  That's what I thought it was going to be.  All right.  Well, call us right now.  But why not give him any ideas?  She got all her...  She was taken aback.  But don't give him any ideas.  Why not?  Do you know who a Brazilian is?  An unclipped cock. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, like Madonna got herself a Brazilian.  Yeah, of course.  The Brazilian waxing.  They want to purdy up that thing so when they're back out on the market, guys look at it and  go, wow, that's nice.  That might have been a little far.  Oh, Rocky, I like it when my asshole looks like Dan Haggerty's face.  Why would we want to get a Brazilian and ruin that?  I like when I drop a log and it kind of hangs in a hairnet under my cheeks.  Every man likes that. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, Sue got a little...  Wow, that was a little wild.  Yeah, that's a thing.  Because you got to think.  There are moms and kids driving to school listening to Rocky and Sue.  And now the embarrassment of a mother having to tell her child what a Brazilian is.  Yeah.  As, you know, the girl is being dropped off at school with fucking completely clean-shaved  pussy.  They're all doing it now.  It's all the rave.  Of course they are.  The second it grows in, it comes off.  I don't understand it.  She's got a K for Kanye carved into her pubes. 
[00:13:30]  That's great.  Answer to the poll question.  And we reach an exciting conclusion.  Well, because, you know, when you have a question like this, one of the beautiful things to  do on radio is to ask a question that you'd think would just have a common answer, but  then wait and see where it goes.  Because, obviously, a question this bland would have to have an exciting answer to make  it worth doing, right?  Yeah, so there'd be some kind of twist at the end.  Is it get a new hairdo?  Oh, you mean one not like a bull dyke lesbian? 
[00:14:00]  She has nice hair.  Grow it in a little.  Oh, does she?  Yeah.  It just kind of sprouts up.  It looks like right after you plant corn.  That's what comes up.  She looks like every actress who is like a really hot teenager who's battling cancer  later in life.  Holy shit.  Could be any kind.  Sure.  All right.  Answer the poll question.  Exciting conclusion.  Here we go.  Do they get a makeover? 
[00:14:30]  Get a makeover.  A little more specific.  That's pretty good.  That's a pretty good guess.  What was that?  That's the whole thing we do.  It's a joke that we do, not really thinking they do that.  Sue does it.  But Sue the hole did that.  More specific.  That's pretty good.  That's a pretty good guess, but that is incorrect.  It is not get a makeover.  What the fuck is she doing?  Kind of on the right track.  All right.  We have another Michelle.  I know. 
[00:15:00]  So many.  Which one?  This is Michelle number two.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Michelle two.  Hey.  Michelle number two.  Okay.  Good.  Good.  One third of the women polled said they do this right after a breakup.  What is it?  Call their girlfriends or best friends?  Call their girlfriends.  No.  Because that would be your support.  But unfortunately, no.  That well.  I mean, maybe they do, but that's not the answer that we're looking for here.  A third of the women do this right after they break up with their significant other.  Okay.  This is Michelle we haven't talked to yet.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:15:30]  You're the only one left.  Michelle number three.  Hello.  This is horrible.  First thing they do after a breakup.  One third of the women polled said they do this.  It is?  Cut their hair.  Cut their hair.  Cut their hair.  You are correct, sir.  Yes.  Cut their hair.  Cut their hair.  Cut their hair.  Yes, it is.  Cut their hair.  Yay.  Of course I got it.  You got the answer.  Woo-hoo.  You did.  Of course I do.  I've destroyed so many relationships.  I know what these bitches do.  See them next week.  They look like Moe Howard.  Shave their head and put his swastika in between their eyes and just preach for a... 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my God.  How do you forget Charles Manson's name?  You went preach for a...  And just decided to bail out.  Charles Manson.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Wow, they have better sound effects than we do.  But that's what happens when you listen to management creatively.  Put the echo in.  That's good.  Yeah, get the echo.  It's not good.  It makes it seem like you're bigger.  Is that what they say?  I think so.  Yeah.  Makes it seem a little more larger than life.  Can we see some more pictures of them?  Sure.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  I'm getting tired of that one.  I want some action shots.  I got soft from that one.  I need a new one to get a little more in my step.  Let's see.  Rocky talks about his day at the fair.  Yes.  Sue bitches at him.  That's going to be the next clip.  Wow.  What could his day at the fair be like in Wilkes-Barre?  Yeah.  A fair in Wilkes-Barre.  That sounds like fun.  Let's hear Rocky talking about his day.  From 98.5 KRZ.  When I got home Saturday, I was food drunk. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, you know what?  What?  I'm a little disappointed.  The plan was Saturday, I was going to do a deep-fried on a stick tour of the Bluesburg Fair.  Okay.  Just listen to the title.  Deep-fried on a stick.  Okay?  The problem was, I was being escorted by the fair princess, who happens to be our receptionist,  Moe Diggs.  No.  And I was...  Can I talk to her?  Hold on.  What the fuck is she doing?  This is a joke, right?  What?  You actually got Janine to play the whole... 
[00:17:30]  No.  And, like, this was put together in a studio.  This can't be real.  This is not Janine.  That's Sue.  From Rocky and Sue.  I never thought our whole thing was too accurate.  It's not funny now.  Because it's just an accurate depiction.  It's a complete recreation.  Yes.  There's no more irony to it.  See, the thing is, like, for Sue, if you can't think of a funny joke right off the top of your head, 
[00:18:00]  maybe a funny noise.  Or just repeat what he said.  Oh, fried food on a stick!  Right, but do it with, like, a little inflection in your voice so people kind of...  Now it's...  Oh, that's...  I'm...  Yeah.  She's acting like it's outrageous, and she can't believe somebody would eat fried food on a stick at a fair.  At a fair.  Yeah.  What are you going to get?  Stop.  I can see if he said he had sushi at a fair.  If you're an asshole, you're going to get food poisoning.  It's a fried stick.  That's what you eat, corn dogs.  Let's hear the thrilling conclusion of this one.  I was being escorted by the fair princess, who happens to be our receptionist, Moe Diggs. 
[00:18:30]  No, no, no.  And I...  Can I talk here?  Just let me state my case.  You just try to lay it on her, and I think that's unfair.  Go ahead.  Every time we've passed another food booth, she was saying like, oh, man, you got to try that.  Well, okay.  Oh, look.  That ice cream over there, they make it right here at the fair.  It's the best.  So...  You've never had pizza until you've had that pizza over there.  And she would know.  Uh-huh.  She won't shut the fuck up.  He hates her.  It sounds at least like he hates her. 
[00:19:00]  Because he did give her a little bit of a, hey, I'm trying to make my point here.  Because he didn't just go make my point.  He goes, can I talk here?  Yeah.  He sounds like he really doesn't like her.  Can I talk here?  Oh, domestic dispute would be great at this point.  Yeah.  Where he gets pulled in and she's got a giant shiner.  Oh, boy.  They really do sound like a married couple.  Well, yeah, I think they might...  Right before a gunshot.  Yeah, the La Mata's.  She is really, I mean, terrible.  But that's just some of the type of thing that you could hear on the Rocky and Sue show. 
[00:19:30]  They talk, they cover the gamut of different topics that the Wilkes-Barre people want to know about.  Yeah, they really do have their finger on the pulse of Wilkes-Barre and the people there and their concerns and issues.  I don't know how many of these we'll actually get to.  We could do them all.  Who knows?  There's like 34 seconds, a minute, whatever.  Rocky and Sue take a hilarious...  Fun.  Fun and interesting phone call.  That is not...  Do they?  Oh. 
[00:20:00]  Can I talk here?  Go ahead.  Uh, fun and interesting phone call.  Oh, okay.  I'm right.  No.  Look, you fucking bitch.  Shut up or I'll whack you with a shovel.  Dude, he can't get his hands out.  No, he can't.  We get it.  You're in the studio.  We know you're there, miss.  You don't have to jibber jabber all the time.  I think she's afraid that like she ceases to exist if a noise isn't coming out.  Which management will hear and go, you know, I heard you get three words out without that 
[00:20:30]  annoying bitch chiming in.  Uh, it sounded pretty good.  Why don't we get rid of her?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Excuse me, um, Sue.  Yeah, I need a house with a bigger kitchen because I like to...  Oh!  No, the cooking.  Is it about the cooking?  You like to...  Do you like the stove?  Well, look at the bedrooms.  Yuck.  All right.  Hilarious, fun, interesting phone call.  That is not a waste of time about someone getting married.  Yes.  Okay. 
[00:21:00]  And we're closing out the show with a quick phone call from Janie in Edwardsville.  What's happening, Janie?  Not much.  Just getting ready to get married.  Oh, really?  It's nice to be.  Just getting married.  Just getting married.  Wow.  So we will have something in common until the end of time.  Your birthday, my birthday, and your anniversary.  Same day.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, one of our groomsmen's birthdays is today, too.  So we're going to embarrass him at the wedding and make him start the chicken dance.  All right.  So who's the lucky guy who you're getting married to?  Garrett.  Ah, that's nice. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  You and Garrett.  Okay.  I...  I...  I...  Rocky and Sue.  He can't get a word out without her fucking chiming in.  Or the phone caller can't even talk without her just chiming in the whole time.  It's Jacktober.  It's Rocky and Sue.  It is.  Oh, look.  Let me try to...  Let me try this.  Hi, Drew.  Oh, hello.  Hello.  How you doing?  You've been looking at the...  You've been looking at the Rocky and Sue website playing along with us? 
[00:22:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah.  So what did you notice?  Can I speak, please?  Yeah, go ahead.  A blur.  Yay.  What I've noticed is the picture of those two, the only thing that's missing is a swarthy  man's unclipped penis.  Because with the hands spread out like that, it looks like every cover of every interracial  porn video I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, no!  Actually, she does look like she's going to accept a nice, delicious load. 
[00:22:30]  I know.  I just want him to explain that a little further.  Yeah.  Go ahead, dude.  Explain.  We're not sure what you mean.  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  Mr. Marshall.  Mr. Marshall.  Oh!  No!  That's terrible.  Screw him.  I figured he might be pertinent to the subject at hand.  I was wrong.  Watch Rocky and Sue do Jocktober and say man calls with pointless, overly explained black  porno joke.  They'd be right.  They sure would. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Rocky and Sue do a hilarious break on transportation.  Yeah, it's like they're going over some of the news stories, and they talk about a new method  of transportation.  Can we count the longest this guy can talk without a noise from her?  Without a peep.  From her.  That would be good.  That would be good.  A stopwatch?  Anybody?  Okay.  Someone time this, and we'll see how long you talk.  Transportation.  I hope it's punching and kicking Sue down the street. 
[00:23:30]  That's her mode of transportation.  Rocky just assaults her down the street.  Rocky and Sue, hilarious break on transportation.  Honda says that they are ready to revolutionize the way we get from point A to point B.  I want to see this thing.  Maybe you can Google this.  A new electric unicycle.  I know what you're thinking.  Who the hell can ride a unicycle?  They say this will not fall over.  I don't know.  So again, I got to see it. 
[00:24:00]  Why won't it fall over?  They're calling it a personal mobility device.  Just been unveiled by the company in Tokyo.  Okay.  Raise your hand if you have a Segway.  No.  I don't see any hands going up.  No, no, no, no.  This is the next one.  You know, amazing invention.  Doesn't fall over.  Come on.  That's what they said about the Segway, too.  And I think it's like so dangerous.  You think so?  Yeah.  I don't.  I had a chance to get up close and personal with one down at the Stroudsburg.  No, where was it?  Tandersville Mall.  When I was down there, down at the crossing. 
[00:24:30]  The local.  Talking to, you know, one of the security guys.  He had one.  He was a master on that thing.  Well, that was like Paul Blart Mall Cop.  He had a Segway, too.  Yeah, it was awesome.  I loved it.  I really enjoyed it.  I wanted to ride it, but he couldn't give it up.  6.34.  Let's take a look at traffic.  Here's Rusty Thunder.  Rusty Thunder?  Fender.  Oh, Rusty.  Wait, wait.  Rusty Fender does the traffic?  Of course he does.  I want to know, Rusty, who does the music break? 
[00:25:00]  Dirty Sanchez is coming in now.  Yes.  To help clean up.  She talks and he doesn't interrupt her.  But whenever he talks, he can go for three or four seconds before she makes a noise.  Yeah, that wasn't any longer than probably three seconds of him talking.  Yet she was able to do the whole preface to the horribly boring story.  You don't think that was interesting?  The electric unicycle?  She can't figure out how it stays up.  No.  How about you just fucking do a tenth of a second of research on the web and you'll find out? 
[00:25:30]  If she just read any part of the article that wasn't the headline?  Yes.  Maybe it would have said.  Whatever.  I'm not even going to argue the point.  Rocky and Sue do a phone topic.  Their listeners are as fun as they are.  Yeah, you know, you bring up at the same time of the day, it's time for the phone topic.  Yeah.  So this means you do the phone sweeper, get the callers to start calling in and answer your question.  Got it.  Don't waste your energy screaming at that drive.  The car horn. 
[00:26:00]  That's her actually.  That was her voice.  A little grating.  Do you need that wake up with the fucking horrible traffic sound effects?  Don't waste your energy screaming at that driver in front of you.  Call the show right now.  Right now.  What are they talking about?  1-800-222-0985.  And what we're talking about this morning.  Handling.  Right.  Josh Snedeker got a ticket from out of state.  Can I just say the siren you hear is on the radio. 
[00:26:30]  It's not behind you.  Yeah, it's coming from the studio.  Just so you know.  All right.  Josh Snedeker got a ticket from out of state in a rental car.  Came in the mail yesterday.  Should he pay?  Uh-huh.  Should he pay?  We'll start with you, Roger.  You're on the Rocky and Sue show.  How about advice for Snedeker?  I think he should pay it.  I got a ticket coming through Ohio, ripped it up, and lost my license for seven months.  Ooh.  Ouch.  No, that's not fun.  That's not good.  What, the show?  Yes, that's how we feel listening to it. 
[00:27:00]  Ooh, ouch.  Wow.  First, the sound effect.  And then the fact that we used to actually, just out of nowhere, play siren sound effect  to fuck with people in their cars.  It worked fantastically.  But did you let them know just in case?  By the way, this is on your radio.  Yes.  Yes.  Sue starts to get a little edgy.  What?  That's right.  I better read on.  That's right.  But don't worry.  She's just kidding.  Yes, she's joking.  Aw, that's Sue. 
[00:27:30]  See, she gets you thinking.  Maybe she's going to go somewhere.  Hey, she did it.  Zig-zags.  That's why she's good, though.  Yep.  Do we need to take any more calls on this?  Yes, of course.  You asked, we're talking.  All right, Missy, you're on the Rocky and Sue show.  What's the senator do?  Hey, absolutely, absolutely he should pay.  He did something wrong.  He was speeding, and he got caught.  Yeah, but you know what?  I mean, Roger was right.  You guys, it's true.  He should pay.  He did something wrong.  I mean, it would be like the same thing.  We went over to Jersey, and just because it's of a different state, and we got a ticket. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  You know, we'd still have to pay it.  I'm not paying that one, either.  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, I'm just kidding.  Sue, Sue, we'll come visit you on Sundays.  We will.  Just kidding.  And that means I'll have to drive you all around when you get your license taken away.  Yeah.  I'm just kidding.  She makes fucking Pee Wee Herman noises.  Yeah.  Ah!  Not going to pay it.  Try to talk.  So, it sounds like we have a really interesting call. 
[00:28:30]  I was being the character.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Well, that's the first show for Jocktober.  That's how we kick off Jocktober.  Rocky and Sue.  Oof.  The definitive hole, and the emasculated poor son of a bitch that has to sit there with  her.  She was really getting a little edgy, though, there with the caller, you know?  Yeah.  Making her feel bad.  And what was he suggesting?  That maybe she would be in prison for not paying a ticket?  That's right.  And he would come and visit her?  Yeah.  Like, she's doing a stint? 
[00:29:00]  And of course, you've got to pay out-of-state tickets.  It's not fucking 1930.  I think they keep tabs on it.  How will they do the interstate travel to get you?  Well, they don't have to.  They send you a letter that says, hey, you've got a ticket here.  Pay it, asshole.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, it's the future.  People cross state lines of things.  But it'll take months to get a letter from state to state.  I see what you're trying to do here, Sue.  Don't beat me.  Don't beat me. 
[00:29:30]  I meant to do that.  Okay!  So, Sue, would you pay it?  Okay!  Oh, Sue.  Let's take a...  I'm trying to use that phone!  I'm sorry.  What are you eating?  Hey, chicken!  You keep interrupting me.  I meant to do that.  Oh, okay.  It's the worst of Jocktober.  Sam and E-Rock hosting the worst of Jocktober.  We're celebrating the close of this month. 
[00:30:00]  Coming up after the break, we venture up to Stephen King territory.  That's right.  Stephen King wanted to take some shots at Opie and Anthony.  So we decided to take some shots back at the morning show that he owns on the Rock of Bangor in Maine.  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of Jocktober.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony shows.  I'm confused.  We'll return with more of the worst of Jocktober.  As presented by the Opie and Anthony show on the Virus, Sirius 197, XM 20202. 
[00:30:30]  We now return to the worst...  Fuck!  We now return to the Opie and Anthony show's worst of Jocktober.  On the Virus, Sirius 197, XM 20202.  It's E-Rock and Sam from the Opie and Anthony show.  We're celebrating the worst of Jocktober.  This bit goes up to Bangor, Maine, but it didn't start with just Jocktober.  That's right.  Stephen King shouted us out in an article not too long ago in which... 
[00:31:00]  What did he say?  He wanted to put Opie and Anthony up his butt or something?  Something like that.  He was comparing us to other horrible morning shows.  And Stephen King owns a rock station in Bangor, Maine.  So I went ahead and monitored the morning show that Stephen King puts on his good radio.  And that's what's the rock and roll morning show on the rock of Bangor.  And so we had our fun with them.  We decided that maybe we could critique back.  So here it is, Stephen King's radio station on the worst of Jocktober.  It's the worst of Jocktober. 
[00:31:30]  Want to do a little Jocktober?  Oh, please.  I love Jocktober.  Yeah, you need Sam in here for a Jocktober.  This is...  I mean, come on.  You know.  You live in a place where they do Rocktober on the radio.  We do Jocktober.  Why pay tribute to the rock music that they play all year long anyway?  When you could pay tribute to the talent on the shows every morning that go out there and give it their all. 
[00:32:00]  And I'm talking those great shows where the guy and the girl are together and they...  Are they married?  Who knows?  Are they not?  Because they act just like we do when we were married.  Oh, it's fantastic.  They're like a couple.  They argue a little bit.  They agree with stuff.  They talk about their lives.  Well, we move on to today's Jocktober show.  Oh, Jocktober.  I love it.  Yes. 
[00:32:30]  This is the Rock and Roll Morning Show with Bobby Russell and Mark the Shark Young.  There's not a Mark the Shark.  Mark the Shark.  No, there's not.  Yes, there is.  Is there a hole?  No.  This is the Rock of...  What?  This is the Rock of Bangor.  Oh.  Bangor, man.  Wait a minute.  Is this Stephen King's station?  It's Stephen King's Rock and Roll Station.  Oh, we finally get to hear a little Stephen King's station.  Now, Stephen King took some shots at Ant and I.  Yeah.  Saying that basically morning zoo radio is horrendous and then he, I don't know, he... 
[00:33:00]  This is like an example of shock jockery and the fact that we should be put where the  sun doesn't shine, Opie.  Yeah, he doesn't like us.  So, he must be doing it right in Bangor.  Basically, I brought this in so you guys could take out a little pen and a notepad.  Maybe learn a little something today.  Is it radio of the macabre?  I hope their delivery is macabre-y.  Fuck. 
[00:33:30]  No, but there is a skeleton.  It's the station's logo.  Of course.  The station's tag name is The Rock of Bangor, Stephen King's Rock and Roll Station.  Oh, he's got to get his name in there.  Sure.  All right.  Well, he thinks he knows what good radio is, so...  He does.  Let's take a listen to his morning show up there in Maine.  The Rock and Roll Morning Show with Bobby Russell and Mark the Shark.  Mark Young.  The Shark.  Marley, the comedian, calls up with some crazy jokes.  They do all they do is caller bits, like with set-up callers. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  Oh, dude!  That sounds like a Rocco thing.  So, I brought in some of their best caller bits, and this is a guy, it seems like he calls  in like every week.  Uh-huh.  He's a comedian.  Oh.  And so, he tells some jokes, and I mean, they just laugh and laugh.  Oh, they're loving it.  They love Marley, huh?  Marley is their favorite comedian, I'm sure.  Mark the Shark likes it?  Yeah.  Great.  So, you know, it's like, we'll have Bill Burr on, so you guys could maybe write down some  of these jokes and have Bill Burr tell them when he comes in. 
[00:34:30]  Ah!  That's not a bad idea.  He's our Marley today.  Really?  Bill Burr will strangle us if we ask him to do that.  All right, here's Marley the Comedian.  It was my wife's birthday.  Oh, yeah?  Happy birthday, honey.  We're loading up the RV and going to the fair.  Why is that funny?  Because of the way he's talking.  Why is that funny?  That's a fucking mean accent.  We're going to the fair.  Fair.  You can't get there from here.  Ah!  They're laughing.  That's one of those laughs where, okay, I know something funny is coming. 
[00:35:00]  It's coming.  I'm ready.  Yeah, this is going to be good.  You think they had to meet with Stephen King to get the job?  Or does Stephen King just kind of give it to a PD and a GM and that's it?  He doesn't have time to meet with these guys.  That's it, yeah.  He's too busy writing his 2,000-page novel.  He's a bit wordy.  Yeah.  He would never survive on Twitter.  No way.  It was my wife's birthday.  Oh, yeah?  Happy birthday, honey.  We're loading up the RV and going to the fair. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, no, you're not.  Get up there.  My mother got on the bumper car.  She's smashing into people.  I'm like, Mom, this is how you usually drive.  She's like Mr. Magoo.  Hey, I hit somebody else.  Hey, I can't believe it.  I'll tell you what, the food is...  Mr. Magoo.  Holy shit.  What the hell was that?  You think they were giving him a little too much?  Yeah, I think they were really kind of padding that motherfucker. 
[00:36:00]  Joke's awful.  Hey, bumper cars, that's the way you drive regularly.  That's how you drive there.  Up there in Bangor.  Maybe they shouldn't do bad driving jokes on Stephen King's fucking radio station.  Yeah, you might hit a rider in your bumper car.  You might hit a rider walking his dog.  Not a good way to keep your job.  No.  Wow, that's bad, Sam.  I don't like driving jokes. 
[00:36:30]  I don't like it.  They're not afraid to get a little edgy.  They're not afraid to go against management a little to push back a little bit.  I hear you, Sam, because Marley does some state fair material.  That's right.  Keep in mind, they went to the fair.  Where is the state fair?  Maine.  Bangor.  They keep it local, O.P.  Yeah, Bangor.  It's local.  I tell you what, the food is so good.  That's good food at the fair, yeah?  Oh, man.  How good is it?  Oh, my God.  He didn't need help with that.  No.  It's good food at the fair. 
[00:37:00]  Good food at the fair.  Here comes the punchline.  Yeah.  I tell you what, the food is so good.  That's good food at the fair, yeah?  Oh, man.  It doesn't matter that there's horse manure eight feet away.  I'm still going for it.  I don't even care.  I had an Italian sausage look like a fire log on a bun.  Did it now.  Like a Duraflame sandwich.  I'm putting mustard on.  Guy's running out of air trying to pump his jokes up.  Like a Duraflame sandwich. 
[00:37:30]  Holy shit.  Was it nitrous oxide in that fucking studio?  No, that's Marley.  That's Marley.  I'm putting mustard on with a garden hose.  Is it bad if you need a sparta to eat a sausage?  Yes.  I could have fed a small village with this thing.  It was ridiculous.  So much food by the time I hit the stage.  I look like Elvis in Hawaii.  The big chunky Elvis, all sweaty. 
[00:38:00]  They are laughing their asses off over nothing.  Nothing.  Well, do you remember how heavy Elvis was?  All right, Sam.  Yeah, we do remember.  Kind of remember heavy Elvis.  So you're trying to say that the guy ate so much food within an hour or two that he got that fat.  He looked like fat Elvis.  Very sweaty.  By the time I hit the stage, I'll go, ah!  I wish Marley's life would end the same way.  Oh, geez.  Trying to push out that sausage on the toilet and having a coronary. 
[00:38:30]  Marley stinks.  Marley's a local comedian trying to, you know, make it.  He's doing his thing.  The Bangor comedy scene is huge, I hear.  Actually.  Just waiting for Hollywood to make their way to Bangor to discover the guy.  Yeah, Bangor's going to be one of those areas that they realize there's a lot of talent up there.  Am I having a seizure?  No, that's the fire alarm.  Oh.  Still blinking?  I love how no one pays attention to fire alarms. 
[00:39:00]  Why bother?  So everyone knows it's the fire alarm.  Should we be running out of this building screaming?  Only when you smell smoke.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's what they say.  They say no matter what happens in a fire alarm, in a high rise, until you smell smoke or see fire,  just stay where you are.  It's the safest place?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, actually, that is the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I would just stay put.  You're supposed to get the fuck out on the street.  Most people do.  You shouldn't stay put.  Because the stairwell, you know, that's not going to burn. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  They make these buildings safer.  Of course.  Negative pressure in there.  It keeps the flames out.  Yeah.  You touch the door with the back of your hand, make sure it's not hot.  You get the heavy doors, Sam.  It keeps the fire back while you're in the stairwell.  I would just take an intern and have him open all the doors for me.  So if there's a flash fire, he gets fucking fried.  Oh, I guess that was a bad door.  Sorry.  Oh, this is wonderful.  We're learning a little bit about Stephen King from Wes in Scranton. 
[00:40:00]  Wes?  Scream.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hi.  I lived in Maine for quite a while.  Great state.  I went to a concert at the University of Maine, and Stephen King buys all the seats around him  so nobody sits next to him at the concert.  Really?  Exactly.  I wouldn't believe that.  He paid for the auditorium, so he has a block around him that nobody sits near him when  he's there for a show.  I wouldn't believe that, because I've seen him at the Red Sox games, and people are sitting  around him there.  Yeah, because the Red Sox, they're not going to put up with his shenanigans. 
[00:40:30]  But he's got enough money where he can buy a box, the whole box.  Here's your seat, stupid.  Enjoy the game.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin.  Morning, guys.  Hey.  I'm just checking this site out.  You know, one of the jocks, Sunday, 4 to midnight, is Fred Zeppelin.  What's Fred Zeppelin there, Sam?  Oh, my God.  It's Fred.  He does Fred Zeppelin.  It's Fred Zeppelin.  What is Fred Zeppelin all about?  I mean, he's just...  He's been there the whole time.  He's one of the rock and roll...  That's his name on the radio?  Oh, yeah.  He goes like, hey, Fred Zeppelin with... 
[00:41:00]  Gee, I wonder what he plays.  It's a great shift, too.  4 p.m. to midnight on Sunday.  Oh, my God.  4 p.m. to midnight on a Sunday?  That is the worst shift possible.  Fred Zepp has a lot to say.  Fred Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Oh, Fred Zepp?  Yeah, that's what you could call him.  Fred Zeppelin?  Does he get the lead out?  Kevin.  He's got to get the lead out if his name is Fred Zepp.  How are you Fred Zeppelin?  You know, what are you playing?  Bad Company?  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to play some Zeppelin.  From 4 till midnight.  What's wrong with you, Bad Company? 
[00:41:30]  What are you talking about?  What?  You didn't have to do the rock jock shit.  It's Bad Co.  Everyone knows it.  Bad Co.  I like the song Bad Co from Bad Co off Bad Co.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's Bad Co on your home of rock and roll.  I'm Fred Zeppelin.  That sounds good.  Taking you to the start of Monday.  Fred Zeppelin with you.  Yeah.  On a Sunday night.  I know none of you fuckers are listening to me because there's 80 football games on right  now.  You know what really must suck for these guys at this station, too? 
[00:42:00]  They could not possibly ever get guests.  No.  Like, what rock guys are going to Bangor?  Oh.  They got guests?  They got Marley the Comedian.  Wow.  Yeah, they got Marley on the phone.  That is a get.  That's a big get for Bangor or Main.  JW, a girl from Maine.  Check it in.  JW.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Guys, I want to thank you for just recognizing what horrible, horrible jokes Marley has been 
[00:42:30]  giving me.  JW, that's what Jocktober's all about.  It really is an inclusive holiday.  Everybody in Maine thinks he's the best.  He is like golden god in Maine, and I think he is just the worst.  It's horrible.  So we brought you to Satellite Radio, right?  You did.  One person at a time.  That's what we do here.  That's how it works.  Baby steps, boys.  Baby steps up here in Maine.  I hear you.  Thanks for listening to us instead of the Rock and Roll Morning Show with Bobby Russell 
[00:43:00]  and Mark the Shark Young.  Why is he the shark, by the way?  Because he's a little edgy.  I don't know.  There's no sharks in Maine.  Yeah.  Shouldn't he be Mark the Moose?  Mark the Lobster.  Something, yeah.  Something that maybe makes sense.  Mark the Moose.  Something that makes sense.  Yeah.  Mark the Mosquito.  It's Mark the Shark.  It's because his wit is razor sharp.  Oh, is that it?  Like a shark's teeth.  Yeah.  Oh.  And he's dangerous.  Yeah, he is a little.  Oh, okay.  I get it now.  I mean, you don't want to corrupt him. 
[00:43:30]  J.W., do we know anything about Fred Zeppelin?  I need to know everything about Fred Zeppelin, please.  You know, I wish I could say I do, but all that four to midnight on a Sunday?  Yeah.  I'm watching football.  I hear you.  And guess what I know I'll be doing on Sunday?  Who do you think his co-host is?  I'm trying to think of a good band that would make sense.  You got Fred Zeppelin and, uh, fuck, I don't have it.  Ah, whatever.  I'm not talking about hooking any bluegills or tommy cats. 
[00:44:00]  I'm talking about Mark the Shark and talking about working for a living.  Mark the Shark, yuck.  Let's go to James in Philly.  James.  Hey, how's it going, fellas?  It's kind of off topic, but I saw a commercial for an Obama Chia pet head the other day,  and I thought Anthony would get a kick out of it.  Oh, it was an Obama Chia pet head?  Oh, yeah.  It's quite the racist thing, but he grows, like, curly green hair out of his head. 
[00:44:30]  That's good.  That's funny.  Hey, is that a true—I'm sorry, sir.  No, that's okay.  We're done with you.  Is that a true statistic?  What?  Yes, sir.  This morning show—  Okay.  —that we're listening to for Rocktober this morning—  The Rock and Roll Morning Show.  —is number one in their market?  That's what it says on their website.  Or number one in their market?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That's impressive.  That really is.  Let's see what market that is. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, it's market 223.  223?  It's Rock and Roll.  When you first start out in radio, you work these little markets?  Yeah.  I've been there.  He's a big shark in a small pond.  And you dream of the day that you could break the top 100?  Yeah.  In market sizes?  Well, they've got a far, long way to go.  And then you hope to break top 50, and then hopefully maybe someday break into the top 10.  Top 10 is, like, huge.  I'm sure they're young guys, and they're, you know, making their way— 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  That's not correct.  No.  Unfortunately not.  They've been—  Oh, man.  They've actually both been working in radio for many years.  Oh.  Well, with the likes of Marley helping them out, I see them in market, you know, like 205 within 10 years.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's huge.  You think they're going to have a big decision to make?  Do we leave Bangor for Wilkes-Burre?  You know something?  Wilkes-Burre is way up there.  Wilkes-Burre was like—  Market 70, I think.  Yeah, right in the 70s. 
[00:46:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  You'd be really taking a leap.  Then if they got a phone call from Wilkes-Burre, they would jump at the market.  No, they would probably sit there and go, you know, we're number one here in Bangor.  This is great.  We're at Stephen King's Station.  Our family.  I don't know.  Do we do this to our families?  I don't think Marley can come with us.  We've got to stay local with Wilkes-Burre, and his accent just wouldn't cut it over there.  Wow, what decisions to make.  Do we change his name from Mark the Shark?  Going to have to come up with something different, I think. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, something for Wilkes-Burre.  They are offering us $37,000 a year, though.  Yeah, that's—oh, God damn, that's a 50% increase in my pay.  Because they'd have to move to overnights in Wilkes-Burre.  But it does cost the cost of living in Wilkes-Burre.  Wow, that's really a lot more than here in Bangor.  Yes.  Jack Sabbath.  Thank you, Chris in Georgia.  Jack Sabbath.  That would be Fred Zeppelin's.  Jack Sabbath.  That would be Fred Zeppelin's co-host.  Oh, that would be great.  See, there you go.  That's the perfect one right there. 
[00:47:00]  Motley Stew.  Does he come on at some point?  And breaking news, this is very sad.  Mongo the Trucker's been up there with his big rig.  Mongo.  Yeah, I heard they fired Fred Zeppelin, and they have hired Byron Maiden.  Byron Maiden.  Oh, no.  And who comes on after him?  Isn't it Ace?  Ace.  Ace-E-D-C-E.  He's a middle name is Edward.  Look, I have a- 
[00:47:30]  Ace Edward D.C.  But they just call him Ace-E-D-C.  Of course.  Yes.  I have a horrendous radio name, but it's a dumb nickname that I'm stuck with.  But, I mean, Fred Zeppelin.  It's not a radio name.  You had that as a kid.  Yeah.  It's not like I said, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, what do I call myself for the radio?  Right.  Maybe that's what happened to Mark the Shark.  Maybe people, when he was just a little boy, said, here comes Mark the Shark.  Hey, it's Mark the Shark.  He's dangerous.  I like when they put our names in the paper, and they put quotation marks around Anthony.  Like it's a character, and my name's Bob or something. 
[00:48:00]  No.  It's Anthony.  You don't have to put quotation marks around.  That's my fucking name.  That's funny.  Jersey Joe.  Jersey Joe.  Ah.  Good evening.  Hey.  Good evening.  I hear from midnight to 4 a.m., he becomes the Grateful Fred.  Oh.  Grateful Fred.  Very good.  Everyone's got their band jokes, so we'll move on from that.  I think we did it.  So, Travis, you can hang up on those people.  Thank you very much. 
[00:48:30]  I am Batman.  It's being pointed out.  I sound like Batman today.  Oh, because of your...  I am Batman.  I'm going to have to, like, fucking rad blow my nose.  Here you go.  I got...  I...  It's not really, like...  It's not really goopy.  It just feels like...  It feels like I was doing coke or something.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I was.  No, I'm kidding.  I would never do coke, and I certainly don't endorse it for the kids listening.  Hell no.  It's a horrible trip. 
[00:49:00]  Don't do it unless you go to Miami.  That's what I say.  Get early and get them right.  That's a terrible message to be sending out.  That's the DJ that died there.  The unintentional overdose.  They found out it was...  Who?  Oh, yeah.  DJAM?  Yeah, DJAM.  They found out.  Unintentional overdose.  He accidentally took a ton of drugs.  A little ton of drugs.  He accidentally poured drugs into his face, smoked crack, drank booze.  He had a shitload of stuff in his system, huh?  He had some prescription, some illegal.  He was smoking... 
[00:49:30]  You smoked a crack!  He was smoking the crack.  I can't imagine surviving a plane crash.  And that was it.  He must have had some demons over that, huh?  Yeah.  Poor guy.  I guess so.  DJAM.  Work out like Lost, you know, where you find your strength.  He said, fuck this, I'm going to drugs.  Yeah, that's right.  All right, why don't we move on with the Rock and Roll Morning Show with Bobby Russell  and Mark the Shark Young.  Mark the Shark!  On Stephen King's rock station.  W-K-I-T, the Rock of Bangor.  That's right. 
[00:50:00]  The Rock of Bangor.  Do they call it the clit?  No?  No.  Oh, K-I-T?  Well, the...  You could.  Yeah.  Well, someone else, by the way, pointed out that Elvis wasn't fat when he was doing  his Hawaiian shit.  No, that was actually like...  Does Stephen S. from Bayshore know that?  He's a big Elvis fan.  Stephen from Bayshore is an Elvis aficionado.  Because he made a fat joke about Elvis and said when he was...  In Hawaii.  In Hawaii, but...  But blew Hawaii when he was doing the movies and stuff like that. 
[00:50:30]  He was still the young fucking stud, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I believe he was.  It's on the delivery, though.  The delivery was there.  Oh, is that it?  Like, the facts don't matter.  Yeah.  If the joke is good.  Yeah, exactly.  Dude, what if both are not there?  We got another clip of Marley?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Maybe you could use some of these jokes around the water cooler after the show.  Aloha from Hawaii.  It was 1973.  Elvis was 175 pounds.  That is Stephen Bayshore talking.  I don't think that's fat Elvis. 
[00:51:00]  Not at all.  At 175.  Unless he was 4'8".  Yeah.  Marley does some material about his 2-year-old.  This is how we ended the night.  We found out that my 2-year-old was allergic to cotton candy.  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  He started eating cotton candy.  His face swelled right up.  Oh, yeah.  Biggamer had to have the ambulance come.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know how much the ambulance ride is?  800 bucks.  Ooh.  What, do they got a stripper pole in there? 
[00:51:30]  Some kind of...  I don't get it.  I don't...  Like, why would the ambulance have...  Ambulance...  The Bambulance...  Yeah.  ...have a stripper pole?  Well, I...  Because it's so expensive to get someone to the hospital?  Yeah.  For that kind of money, you would...  Yeah, you'd hope it'd be a party bus.  Party bus.  By the way, we're looking at pictures of Elvis from Hawaii.  Could be.  Elvis at his skinniest ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Ugh.  It is the skin...  Look at it. 
[00:52:00]  He's in great shape.  That's the Elvis all the women want in a bag.  Yeah, you fucking idiot.  He picked the absolute wrong Elvis.  Wouldn't it be Vegas?  Yeah, maybe the thing...  That would be a safe bet, I'm sure.  The Vegas Elvis.  The Elvis right before he died.  Right.  You know, that's the fat Elvis.  That is Elvis at his prime right there.  But in comedy, you want to remind people of a happier time.  Like, you don't want to remind people...  You don't want to bum people out by bringing up Elvis dying.  Or a good joke. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Okay.  Okay, I see that.  I see that counterpoint.  Let's get back to the kid material, because nothing says good radio than kid material.  Yeah.  Talking about your wife or your kid.  I wonder why his face blew up from cotton candy.  Let's find out.  Oh.  Pull in there.  Some kind of open bar.  I don't know.  Pour some sugar on me.  Poor kid.  Who's Lady Gaga in there dancing with him?  These don't make sense, Sam. 
[00:53:00]  Lady Gaga.  She's a...  This guy.  Why would Lady Gaga be in an ambulance?  In the ambulance.  In the ambulance.  In the ambulance.  For 800 bucks?  Yeah.  I mean...  Put it this way.  For a private show in an ambulance, that isn't a bad price.  For Lady Gaga?  Yeah.  I would definitely raise the 800 bucks.  Lady Gaga is not the person that comes to mind if you're thinking that some hot, famous  person is going to dance for you.  Didn't she sing Pour Some Sugar On Me?  I don't know.  No.  I believe...  Yeah.  That was Jeff Leppard, who does...  Middays. 
[00:53:30]  Middays.  Middays over there.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Some sugar on me.  Poor kid.  Who's Lady Gaga in there dancing with him?  It's out of control.  Oh, that's why I've decided I'm going to open up my own ambulance company.  Are you really?  Well, that's...  I was in there.  Here comes the funny.  Oh, he's going to bring it.  Here comes the funny.  He is going to bring it.  People want to know...  Oh, boy, is he.  If his last name...  Kevin from Connecticut wants to know if Marley's last name is Davidson.  No. 
[00:54:00]  No?  Marley Davidson.  Because he's wild.  That would fit.  Marley Davidson.  You're an ass.  That's great.  I like it.  And with him, while they were taking him, all they would say, you're okay, buddy.  You're okay.  Well, I can talk to people.  Put it right in the back of my Ford F-150.  I'll put a cap on it.  Yeah.  You can call 1-800-BOBS-AMBU.  Any of your people up there in VZ got problems.  Yeah.  Uncle Bobby come up and get you in this Ford and bring you to the...  I'll only charge you $400. 
[00:54:30]  Half price.  That's right.  We can stop it, Divas.  On the way up through.  Is he speaking a foreign language?  No.  There's, I guess, a lot of...  The language of unfunny.  Unfunny.  Yeah.  A lot of local references about, I guess, strip clubs and hospitals and ambulance.  We don't get it.  It's local.  They keep it local.  See, this satellite radio, we're in a lot of trouble, Sam, because we don't go local.  That's true.  On the regular radio, they know how to do that local break, and we can't do that with satellite 
[00:55:00]  radio.  People don't like to listen to the radio if they don't feel like their disc jockeys are  right there with them.  We're in trouble because we don't go local.  We're in big trouble, Sam.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  This is so bad.  This is so bad.  How bad is it, Marley?  Well, it's so bad, it could cost you $400 just to get to the hospital.  Ah, it's giving me quite a headache.  You'll pour some sugar on me. 
[00:55:30]  Sugar gives me a headache because it's, you know, like, gets you all pumped up.  Why is he doing a sugar joke there?  Because his son had a reaction to Cotton Candy or something?  I would assume the stripper pole.  Oh, the stripper pole.  Okay.  Because then you would play Def Leppard music because that's what's played in a lot of the  strip clubs in Bangor.  I think Marley's smarter than that, though.  Yeah?  Because there's a sugar thing.  I think there's a sugar tie-in somehow.  Oh, from the Cotton Candy?  Besides that being a good strip club song.  No, I just think it's strip.  I think he went completely off the sugar at that point and just went with the song being played 
[00:56:00]  in strip clubs.  Wow.  There's a pole in the ambulance.  Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga's in there.  The brilliance that is Marley.  With the swollen face from the Cotton Candy.  Marley's just, he's so multifaceted.  We just found the new Richard Pryor, Sam.  This is unbelievable.  I like the image of Marley watching this ambulance come and thinking, I can make something funny  out of this.  And he's writing about his life experiences.  Found out my kid had the diabetes.  We got Nicole in Maine. 
[00:56:30]  She wants in bad.  Nicole, how are you?  Nicole?  Nicole?  Hello.  Let me try this again.  Hello.  Nicole?  So, I used to live in Bangor, but I have since moved down to Portland, which is the big  city in Maine.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Moving on up.  Well, a couple years ago, they put you guys on the radio, on my favorite radio station  at the time.  You were on there for maybe a year.  And then they took you off, and they ended up replacing you with a fabulous morning show 
[00:57:00]  called Robin's Zodiac Zone.  And Robin tells people for a scope.  We got replaced for a horoscope fucking show?  Ah, that figures.  What the fuck is wrong with regular radio?  Damn.  You would think they replaced us with maybe a local Flav, local Flav morning show.  Robin's Zodiac Zone.  Robin's Zodiac Zone?  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Zodiac Zone. 
[00:57:30]  Check it out, guys.  You'll love it.  I am depressed now.  Thanks, Nicole.  Thanks.  Did you know that we were replaced for that hit?  I had no clue.  Well, you guys never do psychic readings.  No.  No, of course.  Because they're horse shit.  And you're not local.  Here's something, Sam.  We try not to talk vague here.  We try to get to the point.  Get to the point.  Right.  Don't you think a horoscope that relates to over a million people in the paper is horse shit?  Well, not if it relates to your sign.  Give me my horoscope. 
[00:58:00]  I'll tell you if it's accurate or not.  Whore scope.  Horror, if it was on Stephen King's.  Oh, wow.  The horror scope.  That's what they do on Halloween, I bet.  Sam, I'm a Gemini, so why don't you read my horror scope?  Where are the horror scopes in the paper?  I fucking don't know.  Do they still have them?  I have no fucking idea.  Probably by the comics, right?  People are saying that Robin is hot from the Zodiac Zone.  Well, good for her.  Is she hot?  Yeah, she's not bad.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  Well, that's what my little MySpace trickery, or are we going to be able to see a photo?  That's what you need from your radio show.  Her MySpace is private.  I'd have to.  Private?  How do you have a private MySpace if you're on the radio?  You found it, Sam?  All right.  What's your sign again?  Mine's Gemini.  Oh, that fits you so well.  That's what so many people tell me.  The duality.  That's what so many people tell me, Ant.  The two sides of Greg Opie Hughes.  Unpredictable.  Yes.  A little crazy at times.  You're like Greg the Shark. 
[00:59:00]  Fucking assholes.  Just rip it up.  I'm getting more info on Marley the Comedian.  Are you?  Remember there was a Fred Zeppelin on this station that does, what, four to midnight on Sundays?  Marley's real name, Anthony, is Bob.  Bob Marley is a huge local celebrity.  It's Bob Marley.  Yes.  Oh.  Yes.  He is.  Jeremy in Portland has info.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, man. 
[00:59:30]  Bob Marley is one of those local celebrities in Maine that everyone in Maine thinks he's  a really, really big deal just because it's such a small community and everything.  And you're right.  All he does is tell local jokes and goes on The Tonight Show and bombs every once in a while.  But he's got his own kiosk here in the mall.  No way.  It's a Bob Marley merchandise kiosk and usually has absolutely nobody at it, of course.  But one time during the year, he does like a Christmas show, like a four-day show at an auditorium around here that surprisingly sells out. 
[01:00:00]  And he goes to the mall at his kiosk and he signs autographs and shakes hands and people, you know, get in line.  They bring their kids.  They can't believe they're meeting him.  I mean, the guy's such a jackass.  I can't stand him.  So I'm a little embarrassed that that's the main flavor that's being thrown out there.  There was something in there that really confused me.  He goes on The Tonight Show?  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  He was on The Tonight Show a couple of times.  Is that like a cable access show from Bangor, Maine?  Yeah, yeah.  That Tonight Show.  Or are we talking about The Tonight Show starring Jay Leno?  No, The Tonight Show.  What the fuck?  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, he tells like, I mean, he's got like people nationally don't care about, you know, how much the local clam shack in Wiscasset sucks.  I mean, his jokes don't translate on a national level.  No.  They don't translate on any level.  You didn't hear the bumper car joke?  I sort of heard.  That was good. 
[01:01:00]  I didn't tap out a little bit.  And bumper cars are universal.  All right, thank you, sir.  But when we get back, we continue Jacktober with Drifty.  Drifty?  Drifty calls up with the foliage report.  Yes.  What?  No way.  Yeah.  Dude, it's leaf peeping season.  I know.  I know.  I forgot.  It's local.  Yeah, but sometimes Drifty gets a little wacky and veers off topic.  But silly old Drifty is just eating his homemade jerky.  That's right.  Hope you guys like jerky jokes. 
[01:01:30]  Who doesn't?  A lot of them.  No, really.  A lot of them.  There's a lot of jerky material?  Yes.  All right.  It's the worst of jocktober.  It's the worst of jocktober, hosted by EROC and primetime Sam Roberts.  Sam, we're continuing on terrorizing Stephen King's station.  This is part two coming up after the break.  That's right.  When we come back, it's even more awfulness from the Rock of Bangor.  And it gets worse.  Trust me, it gets worse.  Stay tuned. 
[01:02:00]  It's the worst of jocktober.  We'll be back with more of the worst of jocktober as presented by the O.P. and Anthony show right after this.  On the virus, Sirius 197, XM 202.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. </pre>
