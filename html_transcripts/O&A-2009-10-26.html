<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, utilizing profanity and crude humor throughout.  The show opened with a mocking replay and commentary of a forced apology they were compelled to issue following a May 9th incident.  This segued into a discussion about the movie *Paranormal Activity*, with callers offering diverse opinions and the hosts engaging in offensive banter.  A former CBS employee, Rob, called in, questioning the factual integrity of news production outside of shows like *60 Minutes*.  D-Boy’s intense dislike for Lionsgate films sparked a discussion about various movies and studios, peppered with insults and jokes.  Other topics included Bernie Madoff, a mention of a previous guest ("Mermaid Girl"), a Michael Jackson documentary (*This Is It*) and body double rumors, and John Cena's acting career, specifically his film *The Condemned*. The broadcast ended with an anecdote about a chance encounter with Ian Smith in a United Airlines lounge.

A significant portion focused on sports.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, debated the Yankees' World Series victory, with Anthony proudly declaring his newfound fandom (only when they win), while using copious expletives and insults to describe his baseball tweets targeting players like Matsui and Posada, and the Phillies. A Mets fan caller, "Rape Kit," fueled further profanity-laced exchanges about the Mets-Yankees rivalry.  The show also covered Mark Sanchez eating a hot dog during a game, listener opinions on Joe Buck, and the firing of ESPN commentator Steve Phillips, with the hosts using extremely insulting and derogatory terms to describe the woman involved in the alleged affair. Several photos of this woman were referenced. The broadcast also addressed a racially charged comment by Bob Greasy about Juan Pablo Montoya, focusing on the over-the-top nature of the forced apology.  The segment ended with a brief mention of an upcoming skit featuring Suicide fighting Anger Man, who throws children out of a window.

Another segment detailed Anthony's negative United Airlines experience, including a canceled flight and a rude encounter with a first-class attendant he called a "cunty lady." This led to discussions of airline inconveniences and a news story about a plane overshooting its destination by 150 miles, with speculation about the pilots' actions, including sexually suggestive jokes.  Calls from pilots and air traffic controllers followed, discussing in-flight naps and professional rivalries using vulgar jokes.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a child with Mermaid Syndrome, including graphic descriptions of her condition and death, followed by further discussion about the pilots' story and upcoming segments, including "Jocktober" and *Paranormal Activity*.

A separate segment featured a detailed discussion of a "mermaid girl" with fused legs, led by guest Dr. Steve.  The hosts and Dr. Steve engaged in darkly humorous speculation about her life and kidney transplant.  This was followed by a critical review and mocking of Scott and Todd's radio show, including playing and ridiculing their Yankees-themed parodies, along with segments on Rob Blagojevich, Donald Trump's hair, Steve Phillips’ firing, and "Unwanted Celebrity Spawn."  The segment also touched on the value of a rare Archie comic book and a recurring Jack Tober segment.

The show also included several comedic tangents.  One involved a man's ill-fitting dentures and chewing gum difficulties, graphically described by the hosts. Another featured a prank phone call where someone (possibly Todd) shipped a human head, eliciting absurd responses from a shipping company employee.  Finally, a news story about a hit-and-run accident with a victim impaled on a windshield was discussed, along with a brief mention of a previous moose story.  Promotional plugs for upcoming comedy shows were also included.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show!  Hi, another week.  Another week. It's World Series week, my friend.  That's true.  We got around-the-clock coverage. We got Yankee coverage for everybody.  We've been up all night.  Yes, all-nighter.  Just getting interviews and whatnot for our radio show.  Really?  Really? This is your exclusive New York Yankee radio show. 
[00:00:30]  I doubt it.  I see you're wearing a Yankee hat there, so congratulations on the order.  Yes, yes. I usually have some type of urban warfare racist whatever hat on.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I decided to, you know.  Well, you got a lot of Yankee colors on.  A lot of Yankee colors. Well, this I just grabbed out of the closet.  I'm in civilian wear for the most part.  Yeah, you look like you're not going to shoot up the whole office today, so that's good for all of us.  Yeah.  Figured I'd, you know, show a little support on the off hours. 
[00:01:00]  I didn't make it to the end of the game, so it was 5-2.  No.  5-2 win for the Yankees.  Yeah, very good. Shut up, bandwagons. Just stop it.  I'm Billy Bandwagon. You bet I hop back on.  Where were you when they weren't doing good?  I wasn't watching.  That's where I was.  Getting blown.  Doing fun things.  Where were you?  That's exactly it.  I wasn't there.  Jimmy just started watching the Yankees again.  Literally, like, three games ago, I think, right? 
[00:01:30]  No, it was around the playoffs.  I just was like...  Started taking a little peek here and there.  Because Ant was coming in so psyched about it.  It was like...  It was hard.  You've got to check it out.  But I stopped watching for a reason.  You're fair weather!  Yes, I am.  Yes.  A fan weather?  Fair weather.  Okay.  It almost sounded like a fan weather.  People are like,  Oh, yeah, Anthony, where were you, like, the past few years?  It's like... 
[00:02:00]  I watched the games.  But there was nothing to come in here for and go,  Wow, that was great.  Did you see him fucking, you know, win?  Did you see him drop fucking eight in a row?  Did you see him, you know...  Who cared?  What have they been up to?  I haven't seen the boys since they lost to Randy Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001.  You know what?  It's really easy to be a fan when they're doing good!  Yes, it is.  And it's fun.  Are you trying to say there's people out there that actually listen to the show a couple hours here and there 
[00:02:30]  and think they know everything about us?  Fucking assholes.  That's hysterical.  I love when they think that watching guys...  I watched those nine men play with that ball when they weren't good at it!  Shut your fucking faces.  When they weren't good at it.  I'm back when they're in the fucking championship, stupid ass.  Jimmy.  Kiss my bottom.  God damn.  But what do they know truly about you as a sports fan, you know? 
[00:03:00]  Nothing.  I know.  Exactly.  Wow.  Yeah.  The revolving monk.  He hates my baseball tweets.  Why?  That I send out during game time.  I don't know.  What were some of the tweets?  What were some of the tweets?  I think I'm just like everybody else.  I'm entitled to...  Some bad tweets?  No.  I'm entitled to my own fucking tweets.  That's true.  Fuck everybody.  I just put it first. 
[00:03:30]  Okay, let's end it tonight.  Yankees.  You know, let's go.  What's wrong with that?  There's nothing wrong with that.  And I said, well, that was a dodgy inning.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  And then I put, oh, fucking no.  Not Jabba.  Please, you dumb fuck.  Not that fat ass choke master.  Here come the angels.  What's wrong with that?  And then I was like, okay, Jabba did the job.  But Matsui needs to be loaded into a B-29 and dropped back on Japan. 
[00:04:00]  Well, that's a little rough.  All right, maybe.  If you were working for ESPN, they would fire you for that one.  And then somebody was bitching to me.  He said, hey, Mr. Baseball, it's Posada who's killing the Yanks.  Wake up and watch the game.  And I just said, Posada's been hitting you ass.  And he has been.  Posada's been doing a better job than fucking Matsui at the plate.  Last night, Posada was great.  Because the Yankees needed a bunch of double plays, and Posada was right there.  I know.  I wasn't talking about last night's game.  I understand that. 
[00:04:30]  I was watching.  But for the most part, between Matsui and Posada stepping up to the plate,  I've seen Posada perform better than Matsui in the past couple of series.  Right.  I'm not talking about the season.  I'm not talking about anything.  I'm talking about, especially when they were playing the Twins and shit like that.  Let's see if he just hasn't been there.  Joe Buck, the announcer.  Joe Buck needs to get AIDS with his Jinks fucking stats.  Wait, you're still reading tweets?  Yes.  That might be the problem. 
[00:05:00]  You might have overtweeted.  Well, it's during the game.  Every inning, did you do one?  No.  All right, keep going.  Just a few.  But the game is on.  They're fine tweets.  Well, fuck them.  I think I might have to start following you.  Fuck them all.  Yeah, Joe Buck.  I hate when he's like, well, here's a guy, oh, my God, for the Angels, hasn't had a home  run since 1962.  Boy, there's no way he's going to get a home run.  It just, it's shit like that that always happens. 
[00:05:30]  Never fucking fails.  Yeah, just keep your mouth shut.  He is the jinxer of all things.  And then, yeah, yeah, then I got the Posada thing where it said, yeah, dickhead, he's  hit into two inning-ending double plays tonight.  I said, yeah, I'm not talking about just tonight, fag.  Had to call the guy a fag.  Absolutely.  He was getting on me.  And I put the Yankees win, Sterling Ugg.  And then Philly started getting on me. 
[00:06:00]  All the Philly fans started getting on me going, well, you could beat the Angels, you  know, ooh, and not even sweep them.  But now my Phillies are going to chew you up.  So I wrote, fuck you, Philly trash-ass dickbags.  We just beat the dead guy team.  They played for a dead guy and lost.  I can't wait to watch your city burn.  Problem?  Well, it would only burn if they won the World Series.  If they don't win the World Series, then they go home sad. 
[00:06:30]  No, win or lose.  Everyone goes home sad.  Win or lose, Philly burns.  It's that type of fucking demo.  But see, that's what it's like to be a sports fan.  Now you're going to have Philly attacking you all week.  Well, then I write stuff like this.  Fuck off, Philly.  We're not Tampa Bay.  Because he kept going, oh, we did this.  We're not Tampa Bay.  Have fun.  Because one guy said, our dynasty.  I said, have fun with your one championship dynasty.  You're taking on Philly?  You're taking on the whole city now.  Taking on the city.  Anthony versus Philly. 
[00:07:00]  And then some guy says, we have two.  You don't even know what you're talking about.  And I said, dynasty is in a row, asshole.  You don't know what you're talking about.  And then I put, maybe we got off on the wrong foot.  I'm sorry.  You might need a blog.  That's a lot of tweeting.  Then last one of the night was, well, I could, but I just.  Last one of the night.  What was the last one of the night?  And now you won't hear from me.  It's during the game.  Last one of the night was, Ronnie B can take all the Philly dicks in his ass.  Wow. 
[00:07:30]  Because now apparently Mr. Bennington.  He's a Philly guy.  Big Philly guy.  And it's on.  Now it's on.  It is on.  That's what I say.  Gang, gang, gang.  Can you imagine if Ron were such a big Phillies fan that he was found with one after the other  Phillies just fucking his rump?  Like, how would that, like, how would you get them all into one place?  And it's not gay because he's just a fan.  Just a fan of the baseball team.  But why would they be willing to do it? 
[00:08:00]  Exactly.  He likes the team.  Well, let's fuck his ass.  He is a fun guy.  Maybe, you know, not so much for a gay or for looks or anything like that.  But maybe they just enjoy his personality so much they want to stick a dick in his ass.  Wow, Anthony, that's fighting words.  What?  That's fighting words.  Fighting words that the...  Ronnie's not going to be happy about that.  That the entire Philadelphia Phillies can fuck Ron Bennington in the asshole is fighting words?  He's not going to be happy about that.  He has a plus soft bottom.  It's probably nice to fuck.  He's in cushy. 
[00:08:30]  Ron's probably a secret pushbacker.  You think he's not going to like it and all of a sudden you feel him pushing back a little.  Oh, Ronnie.  You're a feisty one.  I like it.  What did Ronnie do to you?  What did he do to you?  This isn't very personal.  It's just...  It's kind of personal when you want the whole team to fuck him in the ass.  That's kind of personal.  Look, it's figuratively speaking.  All right, good.  I want him to figuratively fuck him in the ass.  This is how the game ended yesterday with that dumb John Sterling.  Now, Mariano is set.  And here's the payoff. 
[00:09:00]  Struck him out swinging.  Ball game over.  American League Championship Series over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Win.  Win.  No home runs last night to call.  So he couldn't ruin it.  I actually tweeted once and I wish I was listening to him and there's back-to-back errors.  Two bunt errors.  Oh, I know.  Thrown to first.  When that pitcher lobbed that ball over that guy's head and the one guy just dropped the 
[00:09:30]  ball thrown to him.  Yeah, that was enough.  I've seen statues catch balls better.  I wish we had John Sterling calls for those.  Yeah.  I would be interested.  That was probably very exciting.  Yeah, we could get some of those.  I was trying to listen to CBS Radio online, but you can't listen to 880.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You can listen to K-Rock.  What are you talking about?  You can't listen to 880.  I couldn't find an online stream.  Oh, okay.  I see what you're saying.  That's weird.  That was a great throw, though.  The pitcher just kind of, here, let's give it to the stands.  There's a happy young fan. 
[00:10:00]  Was it a girl's throw or a left?  A guy throwing left you when his right arm was broken?  It looked like he thought he was a lot further away than he was or something because he really  winged it.  And wow, that was a bad one.  Bunts.  Like he's bunting.  He's setting up for the bunt and you're like, oh, okay.  Here comes a bunt.  Hope it works out well.  And they just fuck it up completely.  Did you see the next play that he had to make to first?  Oh, he fired the fucking ball.  He threw a 100-mile-an-hour fastball to the first baseman.  He threw that fucking ball. 
[00:10:30]  Nice.  Let's go to the phones.  They're lit.  Rape Kit, what do you got, buddy?  Oh, boy.  I'm a Mets fan and as a true Mets fan, I'm not watching this World Series.  Well, Ann and I were talking about that.  I'm a Mets fan as well.  I mean, I'm not a hardcore baseball fan these days.  I can't really front about that shit.  But I am a Mets fan and it's tough because, yeah, the Phillies are in the Mets division.  And if you're a Mets fan, you don't really jump and start rooting for the Yankees. 
[00:11:00]  It's a tough one.  It really is.  Just root for a safe series.  Just hope everyone gets out healthy.  Like in the end, I don't think I'm sitting there like jumping up and down either way, you know.  I mean, I got some roots in Philly now, but that's not enough to be all out, let's go Phillies.  I think I want the Phillies over the Yankees, though.  But like you said, there's no win there for us.  I don't know.  I'm going to be honest with all you guys.  It's all about the fact that the Phillies are obviously division rivals. 
[00:11:30]  And I just can't stand the Yankee fans.  It's the asshole, you know, the Yankee fans that pretend.  Not like you and Jimmy, but the ones that pretend to be these real Yankee fans.  And, you know, all they want to do is stuff it in your face.  The Giants came last night.  There was more Yankee fans there than Giants fans.  You know, they were screaming louder for the Yankees than when the Giants did good.  And it's like, it's like garbage.  I don't want to fucking watch this.  I would watch the Mets, though. 
[00:12:00]  Like, if the Yankees weren't in it, I would sit and watch the Mets and be interested in the games and stuff.  It's not like, oh, fuck, you know, the Yankees are out.  Wait, would you be rooting for the Mets, though?  I wouldn't be freaking out like, oh, my God, I want the Mets to win.  Here's the problem being a Mets fan.  Now, you guys get what, 27 World Series, I think?  Yeah.  Well, there will be.  They're going for 27?  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay, they're going for 27 World Series.  So, as New Yorkers, I guess, we're supposed to maybe start leaning toward rooting the Yankees on, right? 
[00:12:30]  But you motherfuckers will use that against us starting next year.  So, fuck you.  No, I'm not saying.  Exactly.  Oh, shut up.  I just bounced you out of the room, by the way, you prick.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  I don't know why.  Why are you bouncing him?  Just because he's a fucking baseball fan.  I'll let you back in.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Because that's what it comes down to in the end.  You guys trick us.  Like, all right, all right, we'll root for you, Yankees.  And then starting next year, when we get into those heated Met versus Yankee discussions, 
[00:13:00]  you're going to fucking use it against us.  Yeah.  No, it's, it's, here's what it is.  I watch, I'll watch with interest.  I'll watch with, like, I'll be very interested.  I love this World Series matchup.  Love it.  Yeah, but, but, but like I'm saying, Yankees, that's, that's like the team I, I enjoy watching.  But if the Mets are in it, I'm going to watch it and be interested.  If it was two fucking teams, if it was the fucking, uh, uh, no, you're not, you're missing  his point.  I could give a shit about it.  You're missing his point.  He's going to watch.  Then I wouldn't even watch it. 
[00:13:30]  He's going to watch.  He said, I'm a Met fan.  I'm not watching the World Series.  Rape Kid, are you watching the World Series?  No.  Oh, okay.  He's not even watching?  No.  All right.  All right.  Let's see.  No, fuck, fuck, fuck everybody.  Let me tell you something.  Rape Kid, you call us up when you go, all right, I'm watching the World Series.  You're watching the World Series.  If it was the Angels and Phillies, I wouldn't watch.  Then I would not watch.  You would be watching.  No, I wouldn't.  We watch the World Series every year.  I swear to God, wouldn't watch.  Maybe I tune in for a few minutes. 
[00:14:00]  You're not staying up all night.  You're not following the series.  But you watch it.  Highlights.  Watch highlight clips.  You want to watch the World Series?  Put your hand up, Rape Kid.  Show her you can do it.  I'm a Jets fan, and I could give two shits about what the Yankees are doing right now,  and I definitely don't want to watch the Phillies win it again.  So, bullshit.  It's bullshit.  All right.  Speaking of the Jets, really quickly, they've got to relax with sports in general. 
[00:14:30]  Sanchez was eating a hot dog late in the game yesterday.  Yeah.  There's articles all over New York.  I can't believe you would actually do that.  Turns out the guy, I guess, didn't eat a lot of food before the game, so he was feeling a little lightheaded.  So, don't eat while you're playing?  Why not?  So, now he's, like, apologizing.  He actually had to apologize today.  And he said, I guess I should have had one of those energy bars instead.  It was like, all he was thinking was...  Why?  It was being gross.  He was eating hot dogs and just been fucking drinking beer.  What the fuck?  And I don't know what the point is.  Why is everyone mad that he was eating a hot dog? 
[00:15:00]  He's hungry.  I mean, you know, we were kicking the Raiders' ass, but that's not a big feat this year.  So, what?  Was it showing up to Raiders that he had time to sit back and enjoy himself?  He was told he was done for the day.  That's why he ate the hot dog.  Like, he was told he wasn't going to play anymore.  These guys need to stop apologizing when they don't do anything wrong.  I was hungry, so I ate.  Yeah.  God almighty.  Where's the belligerence in America?  He had a hot dog.  And then they're like, oh.  The announcers were yelling and screaming, oh, that's a rookie mistake. 
[00:15:30]  That's a rookie mistake.  Oh, yeah, the announcers.  Because I guess they do eat on the sidelines, but they make sure no cameras are in the area  or something.  I don't know.  Why?  Or they run back to the locker room, make believe they got to take a lead.  Who are they, fucking Miss America?  Don't eat in public?  Who gives a shit?  It's all over the sports pages, this fucking hot dog incident.  What a bunch of, just what an awful fucking country.  The guy needed food.  Maybe he was deep-throating it.  He was sitting on his hot dog.  Go ahead, you ready?  Speaking of that game, by the way, I just want to say, hey, Oakland, how does that donut 
[00:16:00]  taste?  Peace.  Yeah, fucking, the Raiders are really hurting this year, though.  And we lost Washington with a fucking broken fibula yesterday, with the bone popping out  of the skin.  Oh, my God.  That's got to hurt.  Let's say hi to Kenny in Jersey.  Kenny, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hi.  Fucking Joe Buck.  I can't stand that motherfucker.  He is a fucking Yankee-hating, jinxing motherfucker. 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  But he was at Jeter's thing, as the MC.  I don't care.  He's a fucking douchebag.  He seems to be good friends with Jeter.  Nah, he's good friends with whoever is going to fucking put him over that day.  Can't stand Joe Buck with his giant fucking Neanderthal forehead.  I don't dislike him.  Joe Morgan, I don't like, because he's part of the big red machine, and he resented the  Yankees being as good as they were in the late 90s.  He never liked the comparisons.  He's not a Yankee guy at all, Joe Morgan.  He's not like the Yankees.  Joe Buck calls a good game, though.  Yeah, he does.  Come on.  He's a jinx.  And he doesn't even make it about himself, for the most part. 
[00:17:00]  When he said Mariano never gave up a run in his career, and next hit, boom, run.  I can't stand that shit.  He does it all the time.  He's magical.  Yeah, but that's just coincidence.  You know that.  But don't say it.  There's no voodoo when it comes to that shit.  Don't say it.  There'll be somebody up there that has not had a fucking hit the entire postseason,  and he'll say, boy, you know, they don't have much to worry about because he hasn't had 
[00:17:30]  a hit, and blah, blah, wham, there goes the fucking ball.  You know it's a coincidence, but it is weird, because it does.  I know.  It seems to happen at the weirdest time.  It's infuriating.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Fuck you now.  Right on, man.  We got a Boston fan.  Let's see what Boston's thinking of this Phillies-Yankees World Series.  Jared, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Anthony, I got to tell you, I will be watching every single game so I can make sure that 
[00:18:00]  everybody sees Jim Norton on November 28th at the Wilbur Theater, wilburhtheater.com  for tickets.  Boo!  Well, thank you.  Well.  Aren't you just a sweetie?  If that's what it takes, then I'll be watching, too.  I say Yankee Sweep in four.  We all know that.  All right.  Fucking Yankee Sweep.  I guess you don't have a Philly gig anytime soon.  The Phillies don't understand.  I wish I did.  I'll be in the Philly market in January.  They fucking, please, Yankees in four. 
[00:18:30]  Eddie St. Louis.  What's up, Eddie?  Hey, how you guys doing?  It's funny that you start talking about Joe Buck because most of the people here hate him,  but we really shouldn't forget his old man was a classic.  But there's two things I wanted to talk about.  The first is I really think that the Phillies are-  Hold on a second.  Why can't we forget?  You're not getting away with that.  Why can't we forget that his dad was a classic?  Well, because he was a drunk psychopath.  All right.  I stand corrected.  Yeah, he wasn't like a goody-two-shoes like Mr. Joe Buck.  I stand corrected.  Go ahead.  What do you got, Eddie?  Anyway, Mark McGuire apparently just signed on to be our hitting coach, 
[00:19:00]  and I thought that was a really interesting development, you know,  as far as him being in exile for the last eight years and the whole steroid controversy.  And the other thing I wanted to say was I think that the Phillies are overrated.  I mean, you know, there's such a disparity between the AL and the NL.  And I mean, I say this as a Cardinal fan, but I mean, I see them.  I see my team.  We played Pittsburgh X amount of times a year.  Cincinnati was a horrible team.  San Diego.  I think the Yankees are going to smoke them.  I don't think a sweep is out of question.  If Burnett is not a wild man and he actually shows up. 
[00:19:30]  Well, you might have called the wrong show.  That's like a sports radio phone call.  That was a good one.  Thanks for the call.  Oh, they have Eddie.  Oh, it's a great phone call for sports radio.  Eddie from St. Louis.  Thank you.  Thank you for the call.  And then they can just compare every position for the next hour.  Well, it brings up a good point about Mark McGuire coming in as the batting coach.  Mark McGuire.  He's been waiting for quite a while.  Mark McGuire better get back on the steroids if he's going to show everyone how to bat, though.  I'll tell you that much.  Because last time we saw him, he had a skinny little golfer's body.  With those little spectacles. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  Almost weeping in front of Congress.  And there's no surprise, Eddie, because that's what happens.  When you get into some major controversy, you just sit back for a few years and everyone forgives.  And then you go back doing what you love doing.  I like Steve Phillips.  Is it a good move, Mike, you think?  I think it's a pretty good move.  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  That's dog.  Hey, what's going on?  Thanks for you, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy.  The Philly fans, they're disgusting.  And for years now, I mean, I live in the South Jersey area. 
[00:20:30]  But for years now, my friends, it's all they do is talk about championships and the Eagles and we're going to win it.  In fact, my friend sent me a text message when the Sixers got Chris Webber and said championship.  It was laughable.  But after three years of losing the NFC championship in a row and in the fourth year losing the Super Bowl,  they got beat down so bad that they finally shut the fuck up for one.  And then last year, the World Series, it built some of their confidence.  So they're starting to come back out of the woodwork and talk shit again.  And so if you're a Mets fan, I think you want the Yankees to win this year. 
[00:21:00]  Because otherwise, the Philly fans are, I mean, it's normal for the Yankees to win.  Philly, we don't want to build that confidence.  But you hear what you're saying?  That happens to almost every city.  Like, I'm an Islander fan.  I'm not talking shit right now.  I haven't talked shit in years.  Yeah, but as soon as we start winning again, you better believe my conference will be up and I'll start talking shit.  Look, I will gladly watch after the World Series.  It won't bother me at all to see World Series champion Philadelphia Phillies on every little African's back. 
[00:21:30]  As they walk around the Sudan in Philadelphia Phillies world champion t-shirts and hats.  Being declitted in Philly championship hats.  Let's go to Joe and Schenectady.  Joe.  Soaking up the blood.  In the Congo War.  Congo.  Someone chopping someone apart with a machete.  Yes. 
[00:22:00]  Right through their shirt.  Can you dab that cleft palate with that Philadelphia Phillies championship shirt?  Joey, what do you got?  Well, you can listen to John Sterling on XM.  They have the home team feed.  So I mute Fox's feed and got to pause my DVR to get it synced up.  But as bad as Sterling is, Joe Buck and Tim McCarver are worse.  Oh, I don't think so, man.  I like how they call a baseball game.  And you're right, though.  I mean, if you're going to go with the radio play-by-play and watch the TV pictures, it's a pain in the ass because you do have to sync that shit up. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, you got to kind of pause and then go back.  Get it just right.  Wait, it's not exactly on?  Hell, fucking no.  There's delays and whatever the fuck it is.  And then you got to be careful and treat the fucking remote like a crystal.  Yeah.  Don't even touch it.  You ever do that?  You change channels like, oh, I got to re-sync this whole thing again.  You've been pausing a movie for a while or something like that, and you sit down on the remote and go, ah, fuck!  Right. 
[00:23:00]  It goes to live.  I'm about eight feet away from me.  That's smart.  That's real smart.  All right, let's go to Dave in upstate New York.  Dave.  Hey, how you doing?  Is it curling season yet?  Why?  You're sick of baseball talk?  Curling.  Sick of a baseball talk?  Baseball just ain't my thing, guys.  I'm sorry.  Some curling?  Some football.  All right, let's go to Philly finally.  It's Charlie.  Charlie, what do you got?  What's up, bu-bu-boys?  Hey, Charlie.  Hey, ma'am.  I was at the Helium Friday night to see Voss and Bonnie. 
[00:23:30]  Voss comes down.  He goes, Philly, I guess you guys are pretty proud of your baseball team.  Well, I'll tell you what.  I hope the Dodgers beat the Yankees, and then they come back and beat your ass for the series.  And everybody was silent.  And then they went, you mean the Angels?  Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm such an asshole.  I'm an adult.  Yeah, but you know what?  The Angels have confused a few people by now calling themselves the L.A. Angels.  Yeah, they're Anaheim.  Stop it.  It used to be the California Angels when we were growing up, and they played in Anaheim. 
[00:24:00]  But now you see that L.A., you know, L.A. versus N.Y. messes you up a little bit.  Just a little bit for us old schoolers.  All right, you know, let's get our pats on the back, Anthony, here.  Keith's going to help us out.  Keith in San Augustine, Florida.  Keith.  Hey, oh, Hitler.  EME.  Hi.  Hey.  Hey, Steve Phillips, you called the shot last week.  He's no longer with ESPN.  It was obvious that they had a part ways. 
[00:24:30]  Well, we told you exactly how this would, you know, work out, and it did perfectly.  Almost to the day.  Yeah, we pretty much said this was going to be about a week.  They suspended him.  They only suspend them for, so the lawyers could get together in a room and look over  his contract and see what kind of problems they're going to have to encounter when they  do fire him.  They knew right off the bat they're firing this fucking guy.  Right.  But they suspend you so they could do all the, you know, the lawyer shit. 
[00:25:00]  And then that was it.  He's out the fucking door.  We called this because we'd been there before.  We know what this is like.  And now he's done.  There's the big headline.  You're out.  Phillips is canned.  And then he went into some kind of rehab, I guess.  Well, you have to do that.  What?  Is he going to go to F.A.  Fatty's Anonymous?  I take that.  It was a rumor that he was sleeping with many people, many women.  How much do you hate this woman?  She's a frump.  She's a frump.  How much do you fucking hate this woman? 
[00:25:30]  Look at that picture.  Oh, my God.  Why would you?  Is that a girl?  I can't tell by that picture.  Who knows?  I think it was fucking E-Rock.  Holy shit.  You weren't here for that whole discussion, I'm thinking, huh, Jimmy?  No, no.  But I kept up on the story.  Yeah, we called her, too.  We were like, she's.  No, I know.  I'm just trying to get your opinion on the whole thing because you weren't here.  We called her a frump.  And you also got to know, you got to understand your position.  Steve Phillips had no intention of blowing up his whole life for this frump.  But she was calling the wife and I fucking hate. 
[00:26:00]  She put a letter on her doorstep.  Holy fucking shit.  He threw his fucking career away with ESPN for that.  For that.  Can I say.  For this.  Where's the picture of her with the Star Wars guy?  I want to frame that picture.  There's a picture of that fucking frump.  Yeah, we talked about it.  With the fucking.  With her with the fucking stormtrooper.  And Darth Vader.  Where she's holding the gun.  She's got the blaster in her hand.  Oh, does she look retarded.  There she is. 
[00:26:30]  Look at her.  How do you not look.  Look at her fucking fat girl sandals.  Yeah.  She looks like me.  Jim.  She looks like fucking Ozzy in 1976.  He was fucking Ozzy.  Jimmy, I nailed it on Friday.  A young Ziggy.  Oh, dude.  A young Ziggy.  And then Danny found a picture.  And they're pretty much wearing the same shirt and everything.  Those kind of look a little like Ziggy.  But she's fatter and less attractive.  I'm going to fuck Ziggy.  Yuck.  Yeah, look.  Wow.  He threw it all away. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  He had a history of this shit.  So that's like.  Yeah, yeah.  But she really believed that.  Mr. Phillips loved her.  Loved her.  Look at her holding the blaster.  Like, hey.  Look who I'm in Star Wars.  Do you think Phillips is embarrassed that the world knows he was tapping that shit?  Dude.  If they show a picture of Ivanka Trump, you're like, all right, I can live with that.  Exactly.  That thing?  He can live with the fact that his marriage is over.  He's going to lose millions.  But he doesn't want his friends to know that he was tapping that. 
[00:27:30]  It's like, oh my God.  They found out I was fucking Scarlett Johansson.  Mother, fuck me.  Right.  You know?  But ugh.  Look at that.  Ugh.  Oh, even her name is awful.  Oh.  She's a big fucking girl, man.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with being a little big, but.  Yes, there is.  Nah, nah.  So 14.  She should be helping him put something in his truck as he's moving out of his fucking house.  Yeah, hell, or his office, yeah.  Could you help me with my desk? 
[00:28:00]  Would you?  Thank you.  Dude, she's fucking horrendous looking.  Oh, she belongs in a pit, trying to fucking crawl out with her fingernails popping off.  My mother will pay you.  Yuck.  She is a wreck.  And that's what his buddy's going to go, dude, what the fuck are you thinking?  What the fuck, dude?  You know his pals are just like, dude, what the fuck are you thinking?  Look at her.  Stop it.  She's horrible.  Yeah, it's, there's nothing like feminine on her, man. 
[00:28:30]  She's terrible.  Her hair is horrible.  Her chin's not feminine.  You know what it is?  Her cheeks aren't feminine.  She's got to give a real spitty, hand-twisty blowjob.  Yeah.  She must give a real fucking wet, twisty-handed blowjob.  That's what happens when you fuck someone at work.  That's why we don't have female interns.  Yes.  Because we'll try to fuck them.  Yeah, of course.  And we know better.  Some of the guys, too.  Why not?  Absolutely.  Scott and Hot Pog.  Jimmy, please hang up the Star Wars picture on your Leno set. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, God.  Put it on the Leno set in the background.  You really should in the background.  Dude, I really would.  Aren't you doing one of those this week?  I'm doing one Thursday, yeah.  Fucking get that picture up there.  That picture's fantastic.  It's a great night to do it, too.  Game two of the World Series.  Are you serious?  Nothing can do.  It's sweep, sweep.  God damn it.  You know.  Oh, that's funny, though.  You were good on panel.  Thank you.  Very good on panel.  They're going to mix up the panel, though.  Yeah, they're keeping some kind of consistency.  I mean, as long as they don't mix me up, I'm happy.  No.  Just trying to look pouty.  No, no, no.  This is what I was going to write you, Jimmy. 
[00:29:30]  They've got to get all comics on that panel.  Fuck the regular Joe.  Every other channel's doing the regular Joe panel thing.  Get the funny guys to fuck around.  Yeah, I heard they may be switching it up a little bit.  I mean, all of us will probably move around a bit.  I mean, Huffington, the Huffington Broad was cool to see the first time.  I didn't need to see her again.  Fucking Baldwin, I definitely don't need to see him again.  And McCain, you know, hot to look at, but, you know, you shined on that thing.  And I'm thinking, Jay, just get a bunch of comedians that are funny and could really riff on these topics, 
[00:30:00]  and you're going to have a hit segment right there.  How much are you charging?  Consultation fee.  You're consulting now.  That's a freebie.  Ooh.  I like Jay.  Ooh.  I like Jay on the arm.  But don't you think, Jimmy?  Yeah, I would like to see them mix it up as long as I don't get booed to that,  but they're going to mix it up.  I know they're going to.  No, you're not.  It's probably their second time.  You're not the problem.  Not that there was a problem.  It still was an okay segment, but I just think it would be so much better with comics.  Yeah.  Guys that just know how to riff off those topics like that.  I don't know.  They made it weird.  You were comfortable, and everyone else was looking at their paper like, 
[00:30:30]  Oh, God.  I hope this works.  Someone told me they played my audio on Rush because I smashed Sharpton.  Can we get that?  Wow.  Did the guys get that down the hall, the Rush Limbaugh thing?  I didn't hear.  It was just a quick play.  Yeah, but people were tweeting that like crazy, like I like to say.  Stupid Sharpton.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's cool.  He's on Limbaugh's radar.  Yeah.  But people don't beat him up enough.  Trashing Sharpton.  That's what every comic should do.  Attack Sharpton.  He should be attacked by everybody. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, E-Rod, give me Norton's appearance on Leno because now we got to play the Sharpton line you had.  It was very good.  Thank you.  You want to take a break and we'll continue?  Oh, yeah.  We have another sports story.  You hear about the taco thing?  Everyone's got to just fucking relax.  Everyone's got to fucking relax.  Perfect.  I got you.  What happened?  That means people out there want to know, too.  People upset at the Taco Bell Black Taco?  What?  Said it? 
[00:31:30]  Is there a black taco?  Yeah, a black taco shell.  They're upset about that?  I don't know.  I was just saying.  I know some people are.  Really?  Some websites I go to.  Some websites I frequent.  That's how you know someone's a racist when a taco shell change bothers them.  See?  It's a blackjack taco.  Eighty-nine cents.  Jared in Boston say my idea is a tough crowd.  But, sure.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't it be? 
[00:32:00]  I'm just going to take it, Jay.  Go ahead, Jay.  I saw him last night being snarky.  Colin.  Snarky.  Chris Rock and Robin were there.  You know, a bunch of big comics.  Ah, there you go.  All at the table talking.  Sure, sure.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Robin.  Yeah, he was mellow, though.  Was he?  Oh.  He's had the heart thing, so he's probably good.  Yeah, was he?  He didn't go on, but.  Is he looking healthy?  Looks great, yeah.  He's on tour.  He's just taking the night off.  Yeah.  He's an animal.  I've seen him in the park biking his balls off.  Literally.  You see his hair?  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  I don't care.  It looks like a fucking monkey on a bike.  We talked a lot about boxing and stuff like that.  He's a big sports guy.  A little fun.  Yeah.  Look at you.  MMA.  You were hobnobbing.  Eh.  A little bit.  Eh.  I wanted to ask how the chest was.  I didn't.  And then Chris Rock walked up and just said hello and went, hey, not, hey, not, hey,  not dead.  That was what he called them.  Oh, we said that to Robin Williams.  Yeah, a friend.  Hey, not dead.  That's awesome.  What pricks you guys.  Hey, not dead.  Comics are all just pricks to each other.  That made me laugh. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, not dead.  Wow.  He's given some award, Chris has given some award to Cosby tonight.  Robin didn't go on.  Chris did.  He's doing some Kennedy Center honors thing.  Biggest boar.  Cosby was a good comedian, but now he is just, now that he's wearing the sunglasses, he's  just become an ass.  Sunglasses, and it's, now he only shows up when they call him Dr. William H. Cosby Jr.  Luther King.  It really is silly.  I have no idea.  He's always doctor.  You're not a doctor.  Not.  You got an honorary fucking degree from someplace because you tell jokes. 
[00:33:30]  You made a voice from a guy who went, he'd be the hobbit on Fat Albert.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Now we're not allowed to see that.  What aren't we allowed to see because of Cosby?  Was it the little rascals he bought?  That was a rumor, though.  That was never true?  No, that was never true.  Oh.  They, uh, he never bought the little rascals and then just tucked them away in a vault.  That was a rumor.  I fucking learned something today.  Yeah.  We're also going to talk about Joe Jackson, and he's got some things to say this morning  as well about Michael Jackson and that damn movie.  And Reverend Al was saying something about Joe Jackson. 
[00:34:00]  Yes, he was.  All right.  We got lots to do today.  I'm still worrying about your taco story.  I thought it was the black taco, but-  No, it's another taco thing.  All right.  We'll tease that.  What the fuck?  Teasing me.  And we go to break with Suicide versus Anger Man.  Have you heard this yet?  I have not, no.  Oh, my God.  This is a great production piece.  Suicide.  Suicide played by Bobo and Anger Man played by Big A.  A couple superheroes battling it out.  Ooh.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide, the notorious villain Anger Man is 
[00:34:30]  hurling helpless children from the windows of the Lil' Leper's Orphanage to the streets  below.  Who can stop this deranged, diabolical, demented mastermind?  No, I...  Nobody can...  Don't stop me.  I'm invincible. 
[00:35:00]  Come here, little Timmy.  Would you like to see if you're gonna fly?  Come on, stupid door.  I'm kicking you.  Now open.  Oh, wait.  Doorknob.  Stop it right there, Anger Man.  Suicide. 
[00:35:30]  That's right.  Hey, right where you are.  Don't come any closer.  Or I'll throw another hopeless child to the streets below.  This ends right now, Anger Man.  Leave those children alone or I'll...  Or you'll...  Wh...  What?  What?  What? 
[00:36:00]  What?  Okay, okay, bye.  That's what I thought.  Up, up, and away!  Oh, crap!  I forgot.  I can't fly!  I can't fly!  My leg!  I'm...  I'm...  By us.  By us.  Us.  Us. 
[00:36:30]  Us.  Us.  Turn...  Aitman.  I'm on...  I'm on...  I'm unstoppable.  Stay tuned for another episode of The Spectacular Suicide,  where Police Commissioner Vic Dumb calls upon suicide to stop another diabolical villain. 
[00:37:00]  The Taco Controversy.  The Taco Controversy is...  Jesus.  Well, it's not that big of a deal.  Ha, ha, ha.  I don't even know where it is anymore, so I don't even know.  But I need to know now.  All right, here it is.  While calling a college football game, Bob Greasy says...  The following about a NASCAR driver.  Who happens to have one of those Mexican-type names. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, uh-oh.  Listen to this.  Well, as the chase hits the halfway point, Mark Martin and Jeff Gordon will look to close the gap  on current points leader Jimmy Johnson as NASCAR's best head of the shortest track on the circuit.  The chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup continues at Martinsville,  with coverage beginning tomorrow on ABC to 1 Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific, presented by Goodyear.  Jimmy Johnson has won five of the last six races at Martinsville, by the way.  This is the first time we saw Jeff Gordon up there in the top five, isn't it? 
[00:38:00]  Where's Juan Pablo Montoya?  He's out having a taco.  And it's Weber who's back in a corner.  And the other guy, oh, Jesus, here we go.  Because he's a seasoned fucking sports announcer.  He knows.  Don't say anything like that.  Oh, Jesus.  No, you didn't say the taco thing, did you?  But the guy probably eats tacos.  We all eat tacos.  It's racist.  Why is it racist?  Very racist. 
[00:38:30]  I never understand that.  Why is it racist?  Because he's of Mexican or Spanish descent.  And you're mentioning that he might be out getting a taco.  So that's a horrible thing to say.  But we all know those people eat that type of thing.  Well, yeah.  It's like somebody saying, you know, where's Anthony getting some spaghetti?  Yeah, that would be very horrible of me.  Do you eat more spaghetti because you're Italian than the regular white guy?  No, I eat a lot of spaghetti and stuff because it's easy to order from the Italian place. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, my God.  It's the easiest thing to make.  It's the easiest thing to order.  It's the easiest thing to eat.  It's just easy.  It's the easiest thing to shit out the next day.  Yay.  It's just easy.  It's just easy all around.  Yup.  Do you have a problem with this one?  I don't have a problem with this.  Nah, this isn't easy.  The guy in fun is like he's probably having a taco.  Who cares?  But you know what?  What does that mean if the guy's having a taco?  Why is that racist?  Why is that bad?  It would be like a black guy racing and then you say, well, he's probably getting some fried chicken. 
[00:39:30]  It's that food stereotype.  Who cares in the end?  Well, I know because you know something?  I was watching a lot of videos about when they were giving away that free KFC and the angry people that were at the stores when they couldn't get it.  Right.  It was all black people.  Getting what?  Chicken?  Fried chicken?  Yeah, yeah.  And they were all angry because the stores ran out.  Right.  But if you're calling a college football game and you said he's probably getting fried chicken, you could get fired.  Oh, man.  You'd be out.  That's not fair.  And then, of course, the new thing is to apologize right away. 
[00:40:00]  So by the end of the game, somebody got to Bob Greasy and said, you better fucking apologize.  Yeah.  NASCAR, Juan Pablo Montoya.  You know, he's a...  Oh, wow.  They beat him down.  Oh, God.  Listen to this poor son of a bitch.  You know, if you listen to the first part of the audio, he can't wait to get his line in.  He's trying to jump in with his line because he knows he's got a good one.  And it is a good line.  What the fuck?  He was stepping over everybody.  And the one's... 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, he's just trying to get it in.  He knows it's going to work for him.  And he blurts it out real fast with a little laugh.  Yeah.  And the apology part is...  I'm not...  I'm not...  I'm not...  We can get to the end.  Here are the...  Here's the original line again.  Where's Juan Pablo Montoya?  He's out having a taco.  And it's Weber's back.  And you're fucking kidding me, and... 
[00:41:00]  A lot of people are saying he's Colombian.  Oh, okay.  The driver's Colombian.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I don't know what Colombians eat.  It's easier to say, hey, he's probably having a taco.  A taco.  It's universal.  And now here's the apology where he's just a beaten man.  NASCAR, Juan Pablo Montoya.  You know, he's one of the best drivers in NASCAR.  I just want to apologize for the comment that I made earlier in the ballgame.  I apologize. 
[00:41:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's all we fucking say.  And we don't mean it, which is even better.  No one means it when they say sorry.  But everyone has to apologize.  Michael Richards should have said he was sorry.  That's an I'm really sorry offense.  Wow.  A little innocent joke, which had nothing mean behind it.  God, Americans are a fucking country of little sissies.  I'm sorry has just become something you're obligated to say when somebody thinks you've offended other people. 
[00:42:00]  So you're obligated to say it.  You don't mean it.  You never mean it.  But there you are again.  There's another person.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  They're trying to get Rush Limbaugh to apologize about that Obama thing where he falsely or erroneously stated that Obama had said something bad about the Constitution back in college.  And it never happened, apparently.  And Rush was like, no. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, well.  He goes, as far as I'm concerned, it happened.  Oh, well.  So I'm not going to apologize.  We all make mistakes.  What can I tell you?  Fuck you.  Why is it to say sorry?  What a bunch of gloating cunts this country has turned into.  Say you're sorry.  Bunch of fucking wash women.  It's so irritating.  Sorry.  What's really irritating, too, Bob Greasy, he got a talking to.  He's talking to.  You hear it.  He got beat up behind the scenes.  Oh, yeah.  They probably threatened his livelihood and this and that.  He's just trying to have fun, add to the freaking, you know, viewing experience. 
[00:43:00]  Is that the old quarterback, Bob Greasy?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I believe so.  Bob Greasy, is he Italian?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  I apologize.  Please forgive me.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I mean, I'm the Italian-Americans.  Very hardworking people.  They've contributed a lot.  Michael Corleone.  Now I have some place to go.  A lot of people are saying, fuck him.  He's not even American.  Anthony demands an apology from Jim Norton. 
[00:43:30]  It's between the sidekicks, Kay.  Shit.  Let's go to Bill in Boston.  Bill.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a question for you.  Yes.  If you guys had a controversy where you said something that was unacceptable over the air  and you had to apologize like this guy did, does it help to, like, further other people 
[00:44:00]  having the same problem?  Does it help you guys in the future?  What do you mean?  Like, if you guys fucked up and then someone on another radio show, like maybe the Jew,  was, like, playing your clips and criticizing you and just blowing it up?  Well, we're not criticizing him.  We're criticizing the fact that society demands he apologized.  Yeah, we're not criticizing Bob Greasy whatsoever.  He should be able to say that.  He was trying to make a joke and, you know, have a little fun.  If he messed up, he messed up.  We're human beings.  We fucking mess up.  But he got beat up behind the scenes to the point where, you know, he sounds distraught. 
[00:44:30]  You're saying does it help his cause?  I'm not saying it's an attack on you.  I'm not trying to attack.  I'm just saying does it help to set this precedent for you guys in the future?  I think it helps to point out how ridiculous it is for these guys that they have to apologize.  Bob Greasy doesn't want to apologize.  And he probably even said just that, but they beat him up so bad he was like, you know,  he went on air and did exactly what they told him.  See, the thing is, man, it's like, does it help or hurt?  I don't know. 
[00:45:00]  But I find that people – now, Greasy had to apologize.  He's going to get fired.  I mean, this show has apologized when they had to because XM fucking completely left this  company – left this show hanging with the Condoleezza Rice homeless Charlie thing.  Did we ever replay the time we apologized where you could tell we were just reading the  statement fucking pissed off?  I don't know.  I've heard it.  No, did we replay it, though?  Oh, I'm not sure.  We should have.  We should have played the homeless Charlie audio.  It wasn't offensive.  It was a funny guy being crazy because that's what he was doing.  You've got to be belligerent when you can be. 
[00:45:30]  It's like you can't just keep giving in to the apologies when you don't do anything  wrong.  I mean, and again, we had to – the show had to apologize.  We got the apology clip.  Travis has.  Let me just –  We're sorry.  Let me tell you guys one last thing.  We had to apologize.  Huh?  Let me tell you guys one last thing.  Yeah.  Thanks for making my day every day.  You guys do great radio.  We're sorry.  Right on, Bill.  Apologize.  Sorry about that.  Sorry, Bill.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Let's go to Rob in Staten Island.  Rob.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, yes.  Colombians don't even eat tacos.  That's like a Mexican.  Sorry to hear that.  Sorry. 
[00:46:00]  We're really sorry.  They're really tasty, so I'm sorry for the Colombians.  So that's what the apology should have been from Bob Greasy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I found out Colombians don't eat tacos.  Yeah.  And he's probably doing cocaine.  Get it?  It's like saying a white guy is going to go eat fried chicken.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Any African-Americans that might be offended by that reverse discrimination joke.  I apologize for this, man.  Yes.  Good to hear that.  Thanks.  All right, brother.  I just want to apologize in case I said something.  That's right.  Just a blanket apology for something.  I didn't mean to drop the C word before. 
[00:46:30]  I apologize to all women because you know it applies to you.  So please forgive me.  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  You want to hear the famous apology?  Sure.  XM basically put a gun to our heads and said, you will apologize.  They had Anthony read a statement at exactly.  They gave us the exact time and everything.  I'm not sure.  I think it might have been 915.  This has to be done at 915.  You read this and don't add anything else to it.  No input.  We had no input.  So listen to this audio.  You tell me if this was sincere or not. 
[00:47:00]  It was written for us.  And it was over the.  Remember CBS wouldn't air it.  The show just started after that on CBS.  And they actually stuck with the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which saved the show.  Right.  Or the show would have been out of work again.  Yeah.  We would have been fucked.  Yeah.  We would have been fucked.  Because.  Because.  Yeah.  We continued on regular radio which made XM look really stupid.  Ridiculous.  So they couldn't fire us at that point.  But again.  So CBS in a way.  Yeah.  Really did.  They did.  They saved the gig.  Again.  How sincere is an apology that isn't our words.  They're written for us. 
[00:47:30]  We don't mean it at all.  We're just reading a piece of paper.  That.  What does that do?  Well how fucked up is society that they accept that?  Society.  How fucked up is it that people out there go.  Oh okay.  Apologize.  Apologize.  Oh okay.  I got it.  They're not smart enough to realize.  No.  That was.  That was forced on the broadcaster.  Yeah.  It's just a public spanking is all it is.  No one really thinks it's genuine.  It's just a public spanking.  I don't know.  I think people think it's genuine.  Yeah.  Wow.  They're dummies.  No kidding.  Hey.  Getting back to the taco thing. 
[00:48:00]  Thank you Dave.  Oh.  Oh it's Struff.  Okay.  Struff writes a stupid TMZ poll about the Montoya.  His name is Montoya.  Montoya.  Apology has 54% of people saying the apology wasn't enough.  What Montoya apology?  Oh Bob Greasy's apology?  Yeah.  About Montoya.  Give us a fuck.  Wasn't enough.  Not that the staff about what they're saying.  Don't fuck with me Bob Greasy.  He should be hung from a helicopter.  I could see if Bob Greasy said he's not here.  He's probably hanging someone from a helicopter. 
[00:48:30]  He's probably mewling heroin in his dirty Colombian ass.  Then he should apologize.  That's rude.  Then that's racist and rude.  That's horrible.  But god damn it man.  Yeah.  Let's go to Don.  Don on Long Island.  Don.  Don.  Yeah.  I wonder if anybody apologized last year for that Gatorade commercial.  We have Derek Jeter on the first base and there's this Italian guy, Mopster, dressed  up.  Say watch out for that catcher.  He's got a gun.  And then Jeter steals second ago. 
[00:49:00]  Stealing.  It's a beautiful thing.  I would have never ate it out of a boardroom or any of that.  I'm certain they probably did catch shit for that.  I don't remember this commercial.  Do we have it still?  Yeah.  It was last year.  They played it a lot.  Derek Jeter was on first base.  We understand the concept.  Yes.  We understand the concept of the commercial.  You just told us.  Why are you getting mad?  Why are you getting mad?  I don't know.  Stealing Jimmy's head.  I apologize.  Getting mad at the listeners. 
[00:49:30]  Are you alright?  You got your Yankee hat on.  All's good.  Yes.  We're going to the World Series.  Don't be mad tonight.  Woo-hoo.  All right.  Here's the famous apology we had to do a mere couple of years ago.  Hit it, Trent.  Oh, that's it?  Hey, we're here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's May 11th, 2007.  We are live.  I just want to say we're taking what happened on Wednesday very, very seriously.  Holy shit.  Very, very seriously.  Stop this.  Well, I hope you were very serious.  No, fuck.  I was taking what happened very seriously. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Because Ann had to apologize.  But you just want to clarify first.  I'll tell you what fucking happened.  They sat us both down.  They said, both of you need to show that you're sorry about what happened.  We're not.  We weren't sorry.  No.  I'm not sorry.  This was so fucking embarrassing for the goddamn radio show that we were forced to do this.  Hearing this drives me nuts.  This isn't us.  Taking this very...  You know what it was?  Because we had gotten bitched out for not taking it seriously enough. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  So they said, not only will you apologize, you will say that we are taking this very seriously.  Everything you hear has been told to us to say.  Right.  This is such bullshit.  Which is so embarrassing.  Oh, it is.  Start over.  If we hadn't been fired, though, previously, we never would have done this.  We would have said, go fuck yourself or whatever.  But we were so gun shy as far as getting thrown out the door again.  We're just like, oh, fuck. 
[00:51:00]  Maybe we should have just said, fuck you guys and went back to regular radio at that point.  We have to keep our phony baloney jobs.  That's fucking bullshit that we had to do that.  God, that really is infuriating.  Oh, isn't it?  Because I know myself.  I don't mean anything I'm saying here.  Let's hear Greg Greasy.  But I like the fact that you just wanted to tell everybody, like, all kidding aside, folks.  I appreciate that.  Let's hear it.  Go ahead.  Oh, that's it? 
[00:51:30]  Hey, we're here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's May 11th, 2007.  We are live.  Bring the voice down.  I just want to say we're taking what happened on Wednesday very, very seriously.  Very, very seriously.  And we're listening to XM on this one, big time.  Yeah, we apologize to the public officials for comments that were made on the XM show on May 9th.  And we do take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom that we get here  and regret any offense that this segment has caused. 
[00:52:00]  You're a liar!  Goddamn liar!  Shut your goddamn mouth!  You suck!  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass.  Shenanigans!  Shenanigans!  Shenanigans!  I think you can hear me sucking through my teeth.  Oh, God.  Like, right after that, you hear like a...  And then I think you hear the paper crumbling and being thrown across the room. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I did it like a live read.  Yeah.  It was pretty much blah, blah, blah.  No, I do live reads with much more enthusiasm than I did that sincere apology.  Yuck.  Fucking made us do that.  Cocksuckers.  I'm glad they're all gone.  Well, dude, but the thing was this.  You were taking it seriously.  Oop was taking it seriously.  Very seriously.  Very, very seriously.  Don't get nervous.  I think at the beginning, can you actually hear, Oop, we're here.  Can you actually hear like a hand clap?  Can we hear that one more thing? 
[00:53:00]  I think there's like a hand clap.  Like, all right, guys.  Party will start, but at first, a message.  Can I just take you inside the thing?  We knew we didn't want to do what we were about to do.  Oh, that was horrible.  And someone actually had to point to us and go, you're live right now.  So, oh, we're here.  It was horrible to have to do that.  Yeah, go ahead.  Play that again.  Oh, that's it?  Hey, we're here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's May 11th.  I did hear a clap.  Well, that was basically the career shotgun being cocked and pointed at you two. 
[00:53:30]  It's Opie and Anthony here.  We sincerely take this very seriously.  Sincere apology to anybody that was offended.  And I remember them saying afterwards, good job, good job.  You did good.  You did good.  And we were like, whatever.  Almost Charlie ruled.  And it was never the same after that with those guys.  All right.  We referenced Jimmy getting a nice little mention on Rush Limbaugh.  I don't even know.  I think he just said that was comedian Jim Norton.  I really, I just. 
[00:54:00]  That was quick, but it's worth playing real fast for everybody.  I think it's pretty cool for you.  Yes.  Let's go to the audio sound bites on this.  Jay Leno, two guests on his show Wednesday night, agree that what happened here was a travesty.  Of course Rush should have been able to buy the team.  And the main vocal protester in this was Al Sharpton.  Why does anybody listen to this moron?  Al Sharpton.  The guy has made more stupid public statements than Joe Biden after a propofol cocktail. 
[00:54:30]  He shouldn't be allowed to talk publicly ever again.  He stinks.  I'm almost shocked that I agree with Jim.  But anyway, I just think that a lot of the context of what Mr. Limbaugh said was taken out of context.  That was Stephen Baldwin and the comedian Jim Norton was the first.  Yeah, Stephen Baldwin.  Now, it wasn't just taken out of context.  It was wholly made up.  That's how you know you're not famous yet when they say, they always do that like they have to put your job first.  And comedian Jim Norton. 
[00:55:00]  Comedian Jim Norton.  Nobody says actor Tom Hanks.  You know what I mean?  You're well on your way, my friend.  But it's funny.  I always thought, I always laugh when they would, like if I would do, I don't know, whatever they would say.  And tonight, comedian.  Comedian Jim Norton.  Ah, right.  Because if they just said Jim Norton, people would go, what?  What does he do?  What?  Does he do animal tricks?  Does he have a ball he bounces?  Does he bounce the ball up and down?  What does he do, this man?  Does he kick a ball?  Let's go to Rob, formerly of CBS. 
[00:55:30]  Rob, you worked for CBS?  Yeah, for about 18 years, boys.  All right.  You guys are the biggest bunch of weenies.  You know, I left.  I had enough of that bullshit.  And I packed my bags.  I opened up my own company.  And I said, fuck you, boys.  Because they would tell you how they wanted the news editor.  And forget about, you know, don't let the facts stand in the way of a good story.  Yes.  Ah, I say that a lot.  That's kind of something they don't.  That's something they do say in the news division all the fucking time. 
[00:56:00]  They don't really care about the facts as much as you think.  The only news that has any real integrity is 60 Minutes.  And even they have faltered and stumbled on their ass every now and then.  Yeah.  So, we would have producers that would come by at the end of every piece.  It didn't matter if it was Chris Borken, you know, back in the days of old, Jim Jensen.  Jim Jensen.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, yeah.  Jim Slattery.  John Slattery.  And Vic Pyle. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  These guys, the producers would come by and they would screen the pieces to make sure that, A, they were factual.  And how the hell would they know?  Because they weren't in the room when we cut them.  But I guess to make sure that if a word or something derogatory was out of place, boom, gone.  Out of the piece.  Do you have any verification of this?  Yeah.  18 years and five Emmys.  Fuck it all.  No, but I mean, do you, how do we know you worked there?  You could just be saying this stuff and getting us in trouble. 
[00:57:00]  How, how am I getting you in trouble?  Because you're saying that they fucking fact-checked certain things that we don't know if they fact-checked.  So how, it's stupid.  No, the majority of the news is fact-checked and fact-  Yeah, but then you, you'd be, yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Then you're saying this guy came in and said this and this producer, Jim Jensen, said that.  Sorry.  I broke out.  He was just doing, he was doing Mean Jimmy.  It's the new bed.  It's the new bed.  I pulled up a sign that said, get angry. 
[00:57:30]  My acting just couldn't pull it off.  Mean Jimmy fell apart.  It started well.  It was so stupid because the guy wasn't saying anything inflammatory.  No, of course he wasn't.  No, but that's what makes me good.  Talking about his job.  It just comes out of nowhere.  I'm sorry, Mr.  All right, Rob.  15 years and eight Emmys.  Jimmy, it's not about what the reporters would say.  It could be a soundbite that somebody would say in a neighborhood that you picked out, you know?  Right.  So it had nothing to do with the reporters.  The reporters were just laying in a soundbite as a piece of factual information. 
[00:58:00]  And the producer would come by and say, you know, it's really not a good idea to put that soundbite in the piece.  You know, so you're actually reiterating what somebody in the neighborhood would say.  In other words, it's all bullshit, man!  It is.  It was total madness.  Of course.  And by the way, he's 18 years and five Emmys, Anthony.  Not 15 years and eight Emmys.  Oh, I thought that was...  You just made his career a whole lot better.  I really did.  You made him a whole lot more effective.  Sorry, Rob.  This guy's two years, 30 Emmys. 
[00:58:30]  I didn't know you stunk as much as Jimmy said.  They give out a lot of Emmys, don't they, Rob?  Just hand them out.  Just hand them out.  Listen, I have an affliction like Anthony.  I like young girls, too.  Oh, fucking A.  Wait, 18 years, five Emmys, one conviction.  All right, Rob.  I used to do some Arnie Diaz, shame on you stuff.  Oh, wow.  Really?  What a nudge he is.  With that creepy mustache of his.  Well, he was creepy, but I got to tell you, behind the scenes, Arnie is a, as we say, 
[00:59:00]  he's a real mensch.  A mensch.  He's a really good guy.  I've had, you know those stories with the luggage sales?  Everybody going out of business, everybody going out of business?  Yeah.  We went into one of those stores, and a guy came after me with a luggage cart, and Arnie  got put himself in front of me in the camera.  Let me ask you, did you rather sued CBS, and actually his suit was thrown out.  Did you know rather or no?  I have worked with rather, and I think rather is a gentleman, and I think rather is a very,  very nice guy.  And the networks have a way of really screwing over nice people. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  All right.  All right, mister.  Thanks, Rob.  Little insight.  Little insight to the news biz.  We got the pedo on the news.  What happened?  In the news.  Who?  He admitted to it.  Who?  He likes young girls.  Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.  Missed that part.  Hey, this paranormal activity.  I don't know what to make of this damn fucking movie.  Some people love it, and some people fucking hate it.  Cash, cash, cash is what that thing's making. 
[01:00:00]  I'll tell you this much.  Number one at the movies this weekend.  It was made for $15,000.  $15,000.  We could bankroll that.  We could have bankrolled this fucking movie.  It has made $62 million to date.  And it's still-  It'll never work again.  Huh?  And it's going to make another easy $30,000 or $40,000 before it fades out of the theaters.  Then it goes DVD.  Then it goes international.  This thing is a monster.  Wow.  And it only costs $15,000 to make.  Dude, for $15,000, I want to make a show just called Jim Traipses Around and fill myself and release it and make a cool mill. 
[01:00:30]  Just to show me skipping and jogging about.  It beat out Where the Wild Things Are, which, you know, that was a major Hollywood blockbuster movie that, you know, cost millions and millions and millions.  Yeah.  So, uh-  Nice percentage on your investment.  Has anyone seen Paranormal Activity on staff?  No.  Patrice saw it.  He commented on it. 
[01:01:00]  What did he say again?  He said, nah, those goddamn movies with the handheld cameras and-  Yeah.  I don't like-  He didn't like it.  Here comes Sam.  I guess Sam saw the movie.  Like, shit.  So, he'll be representing the black community.  Does the black community like Paranormal Activity, Sam?  Well, they usually do like horror movies.  Were there a lot of black people in the theater?  Well, I went early in the day.  That's my new thing, going early in the day.  So, there weren't many people in theater at all.  It's the smartest thing. 
[01:01:30]  I do the same thing.  I go alone.  It's the only way to go see movies.  I like noon.  Yeah, noon's a nice time.  Noon?  Oh, so you go where everybody, you know, is still sleeping.  It's the weekend.  People sleep in.  I mean, yeah, you know what I mean, though.  Well, I mean, yeah, because it's the weekend.  Yeah.  D-Boy said it was awful.  He says everything's awful.  He's a miserable person.  We all know that.  And he was probably drunk during it and didn't understand it.  He fell asleep and then vomited when he woke up.  Who, dumb Derek? 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  No, it's D-Boy.  D-Boy.  Here comes D-Boy.  B-O-I, by the way, how they spell it in the gay community.  Okay, good.  D-Boy, you didn't like Paranormal Activity?  First, I was drunk and it was shit, actually.  It was really bad.  What was bad about it?  First of all, it takes like an hour to actually get into the entire movie.  I hate those type of movies.  And then it's just...  Character development?  Yeah, what am I waiting around for?  Get me scared.  Let's go.  It's just bad.  It's hard to watch.  You know, it's just...  No, not at all. 
[01:02:30]  Then why has everyone seen this fucking thing?  I don't know.  It's a lot of hype.  Just like the Blair Witch Project, I guess.  But, yeah, it's just shit, really.  Is the acting bad?  Yeah, well, I mean, they didn't use real actors.  I think it was just like, you know, two normal people, actually.  But, yeah, it was just...  It's really hard to get into.  And it takes like an hour for anything to start happening.  You like action up front, don't you?  All right, when it starts happening, is it scary?  No.  Not at all.  No.  Now, how come everyone says it's so scary?  I don't know.  What about when that shit jumps out, like, in the doorways and stuff? 
[01:03:00]  You didn't go like, whoa.  What are you talking about?  Like that scene, that's the one scene that they show in the trailer in the bedroom.  And something comes out through the bedroom door and ran up to the camera.  A weird shadowy thing, right?  Oh, I think that's the end of it, actually.  Oh, thanks.  Like, most of the highlights are actually in the trailer.  Like, her getting dragged out of the bed and the footprints and all that.  Yeah, that's in the trailer.  So you can just watch the trailer.  Yeah, and you get the pretty much all scared of it.  Did you see the trailer?  I get very frightened to see this.  Let me see.  It's frightening.  It's a trailer, anyway.  Let me go to Eric in Jersey. 
[01:03:30]  Eric.  D-Boy's a fucking dummy.  That movie is awesome.  Yeah, D-Boy is a dummy.  Well, wait, Sam, you liked it?  Yes.  Eric on the phone liked it?  Why do you guys like Paranormal Activity?  D-Boy is the type of person that doesn't like things when they get hyped up?  Yeah.  Well, first of all, first of all, the movie was made actually for only $10,000.  Then Steven Spielberg bought the script.  He bought the rights to it, and he changed the last two or three minutes, and that's what 
[01:04:00]  added the, like, additional $5,000 cost.  He bought it for $350,000.  It's phenomenal what this movie has done, and it's scary as shit.  Yeah, I mean, if you're scared of ghosts and things, like, in your house, then you'll  be scared of it, because it seems like there's a ghost in the house.  If you're not scared of ghosts, then you probably won't be scared of it.  If you didn't like Blair Witch, then you won't like this. 
[01:04:30]  But if you did like Blair Witch, then you will like this.  I hate the panorantle.  I can't say that word.  I could never say that word.  The problem with Blair Witch was it only had one scene.  It was a psychological thriller, and you watch the breakdown of these teenagers, and it all  came to a head in one second where Mikey was standing in the corner.  This actually has five or six different distinct points where it's like, holy fuck, that shit 
[01:05:00]  could happen.  Yeah, this movie is scarier than Blair Witch.  I've never seen Blair Witch.  D-Boy?  No.  Here comes D-Boy.  Back to the moment.  It's really bad, actually.  Nobody in this room, I think, would enjoy it.  Wow.  Why do we have two completely different opinions?  Because D-Boy doesn't like things.  Yeah, but Sam has a very unique flavor.  You know what I mean?  He likes...  Sam likes horror movies.  Sam's a little boy.  Yeah, Sam likes Rob Zombie horror movies.  Danny likes zombie movies. 
[01:05:30]  What I'm saying is...  Sam's a little boy.  How many movies are there?  He is a little...  Yeah, exactly.  Your tastes are like of a little boy.  Danny wears t-shirts of horror movies.  Those would probably like it.  But Danny likes horror movies.  So does Sam.  No, Sam likes silly movies.  And wrestling.  I don't understand what's going on.  You're stupid.  And hip-hop.  And hip-hop.  And hip-hop, yeah.  Sam's like a teenage girl.  Yeah, yeah.  You like John Cena's movie.  You like tween movies.  You must like that Twilight series, right? 
[01:06:00]  Twilight.  No, I don't.  Sam watches Degrassi Jr.  He watches Degrassi and Gossip Girl.  He watches High School Musical.  Yeah.  That type of thing.  I don't watch, no.  We know, Sam.  Yeah, go ahead.  All right.  The night of the animation festival, I actually dropped off a knife before Anthony.  It was a little pocket knife with a bunch of swastikas.  It was an old Nazi knife.  Did he ever get it?  Yes, I did.  I have that one still.  All right, cool.  Well, I hope you like it.  All right. 
[01:06:30]  That's it?  It was made in China, but I like it.  All right.  Well, you know, the real one's a lot more expensive than the novel.  Yeah, I understand, but, you know.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let me go back to Chris in Jersey.  Chris says Paranormal Activity is a smart movie.  D-Boy, is it a smart movie?  No, it is not.  Chris, what do you got?  D-Boy.  I just want to say that, like, horror movies these days are all about blood and gore,  and this movie is actually about building suspense.  If you sit there and you actually get into it, it's scary. 
[01:07:00]  Like, if you, like, let it build up the suspense, it's good.  You know what's a great horror movie where there's, like, a lot of suspense built up?  I'm writing one where there's a man, and he buys a house in the woods.  Oh, shit.  And every time he puts his hat on the table, it gets knocked onto the linoleum.  Like, the camera pans next to his fedora, and you see it just moving, and a ghostly hand  is pushing the hat onto the floor.  You win that hat.  That's right.  And sometimes he'll walk in, and a breeze will come, and the door's not even open, and he 
[01:07:30]  gusses his hat off onto the floor.  Oh, that's scary.  Yes.  Sure is.  It's a smart movie, we're finding out, huh?  Chris?  Yes.  I think it's got more in it than any of the other horror movies that are coming out these  days.  All right.  It's just, it's very different than what we're used to.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Ryan in Wisconsin.  Ryan?  Yeah, I got a group of people.  This movie is shit.  Wow.  Wow.  There's no, like, middle ground here.  Feast or famine, right?  It was made for $15,000, and you can't. 
[01:08:00]  We know.  The acting is horrible, overacted, just a bad movie.  Well, it's not supposed to be acted well, because there's not, they're not actors doing  it.  It's supposed to look like it was made for $15,000, whatever the fuck.  I've heard $11,000, I've heard $15,000.  And it made a fuckload of money, so people are going to see it.  And it's a true story.  Stop it.  Do these guys only make fucking $350,000 off it, though? 
[01:08:30]  Or do they get a piece of the gate, I wonder, after?  Oh, my God.  I bet you they just made $350,000 off it.  Oh, that's got to be painful.  And they were probably like, dude, look how much we made, $350,000.  Oh, if they, it seemed like a good thing to do at the time.  You sell your $15,000 movie for $350,000.  You know what, though?  You need the promotion behind it.  You need that promotion machine behind it.  Don't tell me those guys aren't getting rich off this.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  I have a feeling a lot of the message board posts about people saying it's the scariest 
[01:09:00]  movie ever.  The studio's making a boatload of money.  Could they possibly be paying these people to put that on the message board?  No.  They wouldn't do anything like that.  That would never happen.  Stop it.  We're just doing that.  Marketing where it's actually everyone from the fucking studio doing it.  That never happens.  Oh, never.  That's a very good point, Ryan.  All right, fuck it up, boys.  Hey, another guy agreeing with?  Well, we'll find out.  Ryan in Boston.  Ryan.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I saw it the other night, man.  I agree with D-Boy.  I think the movie sucks.  Another one for D-Boy. 
[01:09:30]  Agreeing with D-Boy.  I couldn't wait to get out of my goddamn seat and get out of there.  Really?  That's because you were either drunk or you're stupid.  Now, we try not to do the spoiler thing as much these days, so without giving a spoiler  out, why did you hate the movie?  It was just terrible.  Like they said, man, I guess if you could get into it somehow, but it was so dry and boring.  I mean, I don't know how you could get into it.  I kept, you know, they keep showing you time-lapse and time-lapse and time-lapse, and you're like  just waiting for something actually to happen, and then when it does, it's over. 
[01:10:00]  And you're like, wow, I just sat it for two hours for a 13-second scene.  You wait for something to happen, and then the thing happens, and then the thing is  over.  Well, that's what happened with Blair Witch.  You sat there, you watched them walk through the fucking woods, and then at the end, there  was that mysterious fucking ending of them standing in the corner while the fucking  somebody dies and the camera falls to the ground, and it's scary as shit, and then it's  over.  But the little children's handprints are scary. 
[01:10:30]  The sounds, it's in the woods, so that's just scary, you know.  It's very scary.  But the thing is, it's not like he said, like the other caller said, it was not one  scare in this movie.  It happens throughout.  This caller was obviously blackout drunk when he saw the film.  Like D-Boy.  Like D-Boy was, and therefore does not have a solid memory of what happened in the motion  picture.  D-Boy, what do you think of Sam?  Is he crazy here?  Yeah, I mean, going back to the Blair Witch thing, too, it was marketed a lot better.  It was marketed as like three kids gone missing. 
[01:11:00]  You know, this just came out of the blue as some fucking stupid like home movie or something  like that.  Like there's actually like a background to the Blair Witch thing.  Like there's no background to this.  Do you take the little bottles like they give you on the airplane and dump out some of your  coke and then pour it in and mix it up and drink it?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  He actually has a very teeny hat, like the beer things that he puts his little airplane  liquor things in with a little teeny holders.  Well, let's go to Beth in Ohio. 
[01:11:30]  We haven't heard from the females yet.  Beth.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I hear you calling.  Yeah, I just saw Paranormal Activity last night.  It sucks a dick.  Oh, so the girls don't like Paranormal Activity, I see.  Wow.  That's right, Sam.  I turned to my husband in the first 15 minutes of the movie and said, here's what's going  to happen.  Oh, don't say it.  So it's just.  What?  He belted you?  Exactly.  Here's what's going to happen.  You're going to punch me in the face.  You're going to drink more of that liquor and get pulled over driving home and go to 
[01:12:00]  jail again.  And he did.  Well, you're going to donkey punch me at home.  Well, you're going to stick your dick through that popcorn fucking container again.  I'm going to have to jerk you off while the frightening movie is playing.  And it happens.  And I'm going to get salt all over your weenie and you're going to belt me.  All right.  Thank you, madam.  Welcome out, guys.  Thanks.  Here's what's going to happen.  And it did.  Humpax makes a very good point.  How good is a movie that you have to mention how little it was made for each time you talk 
[01:12:30]  about it?  That's the biggest thing about this movie.  That's a very good point.  Every time it's brought up.  Hey, by the way.  Fucking five bucks.  Made for 15,000.  Ten bucks it was made for.  That gets brought up because it's very atypical.  It's also brought up that this movie has scared many audiences.  It was made for 15.  Let's go to Greg.  Let's go to Greg on Long Island.  Perhaps more than Ray.  Greg.  Hello, Greg.  Greg.  Greg.  Hey, if you don't like this movie, I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. 
[01:13:00]  See?  Thank you very much.  If you don't like this movie, what the hell is wrong with you?  The thing with people is some people just don't get it.  That's right.  Well, D-Boy, I guess you just didn't get it.  No, I don't understand what's there to get, actually.  D-Boy also, he hates Lionsgate as a production company, and therefore any film that gets  put out.  Why does he hate Lionsgate?  Why do you just...  This doesn't fall under the umbrella.  Is this true?  But this is just to paint D-Boy's character. 
[01:13:30]  Why does he hate Lionsgate?  Any film that falls under the Lionsgate banner, D-Boy will not give crevies to.  Lionsgate, they've had some pretty good movies.  No, they haven't.  What's some of those Lionsgate movies?  I don't even...  They're shit.  Why do you hate Lion's Gate?  I will not watch a TriStar movie.  I won't watch a Lionsgate movie.  Who knows what a Lionsgate movie is?  Exactly.  Who cares?  I never know.  Only D-Boy.  Okay, what do we got?  I think they did 310 to Yuma Jima, whatever that... 
[01:14:00]  I didn't see that.  American Psycho?  American Psycho, yeah.  That was a really bad movie there, D-Boy.  Don't ruin you.  That was early on.  All right, go late for Lionsgate.  I think he's talking about the last couple of years, I would imagine.  Let's see.  D-Boy wins with American Psycho 2.  Well, yeah.  The Cooler was kind of good.  Yeah, The Cooler, I liked that.  I liked that.  House of a Thousand Corpses.  Uh-oh.  Lionsgate.  Lionsgate, yeah.  Incorrect.  That was actually pretty good.  Madea, fucking Madea Class Reunion, yo.  What about Cube Zero? 
[01:14:30]  Oh, shit.  Hold on there.  Hero of Clowns?  The Dirty Dancing sequel?  Yes.  Hotel Rwanda.  Oh, but it was co-produced with United Artists, so I'm sorry.  It doesn't count.  What do you think of UA?  You don't mind them?  No, don't mind them at all.  How about Universal?  What about Columbia Pictures?  Columbia, I have a little problem.  What do you think of DreamWorks?  A little problem with Columbia.  A little problem with Columbia.  You're insane!  How about DreamWorks?  DreamWorks, yeah, not bad.  What do you think is good?  I think he's serious.  See, this is what I'm saying. 
[01:15:00]  This is the movie.  He's nuts.  You're getting movie advice from this person.  What do you think about it?  What do you like, Derek?  What movies?  What movies do you want?  Hard Candy was good.  Recently?  No, no.  What production company?  Universal's a good one.  Yeah.  You've got to love that.  The Big Earth.  And this whole Universal comes around it.  Holy shit, he's cuckoo.  What about Paramount Pictures?  Paramount Pictures.  Paramount's a good one, too.  Indiana Jones.  Yes.  All the classics.  Come on.  How about Orion?  Danny.  Orion.  Is Caddyshack?  No, I don't think so.  Go to the last couple of years for Lionsgate.  This is nothing new, too. 
[01:15:30]  This has been going on since I've known Derek.  So this is like five years now.  He'll mention, he'll be like, dude, I saw that movie that we were talking about last  week.  Fucking Lionsgate.  Fucking Lionsgate.  That's so fucked up.  What about Waltz?  Waltz Pictures.  That war picture with Johnny Fontaine.  All right, let me get to Justin.  He's chomping at the bit here.  Justin, what do you got?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  I feel that if you don't like this movie, you're just a fucking moron. 
[01:16:00]  Thank you very much.  That's true.  Why?  Why did you like it, Justin?  It's basically instant gratification.  Like, I can't sit through things like plot development and story.  Ooh.  Yeah.  And Derek also complains that movies are just gore.  So this movie, he's complaining that there's nothing in it like gore.  And then if there was gore, he'd come in and say, no, it was just gore.  Like one of your Rob Zombie movies, which are just senseless gore.  That's not senseless because there's a good storyline. 
[01:16:30]  And, D-Boy, you see the Rob Zombie horror flicks?  No, I won't watch them.  Why not?  I watched, like, the first ten minutes of one of them, and I couldn't even get through that.  Sucked an ass.  Did you like his Halloween version?  I thought it was good.  The first one?  No, Rob Zombie's Halloween.  I know, the first one?  I didn't see the second one.  I saw the first one.  Yeah.  It was all right.  It was good.  Give him a break.  Jimmy and Queens, my 16-year-old daughter, said it sucked.  Exactly.  Girls don't like it.  Like Derek.  Nice.  What?  I'm on the radio, mate.  Yeah, what's up, George?  What's up, George? 
[01:17:00]  How are you guys doing?  I just wanted to call up and say that I saw that movie, Paranormal Activity, at a screening.  It scared the living shit out of me.  I know.  I know.  Listen, I love that you guys have been doing this bit.  Fucking, I'm trying to turn all my Australian brothers on to this show.  Great thing you're having, you know, Jason Ellis, all these guys on.  But no, seriously, give that movie a watch, because it's fucking great.  It made my vagina hurt.  I'm going to break your hymen.  You know, one thing that bothers me is all this baseball talk. 
[01:17:30]  When do you guys talk about soccer?  It's a great sport, gentlemen.  I don't see what all the hatred in the United States is for.  You're so boring.  He's so fake, by the way.  We'll talk about soccer when it doesn't suck.  Atred.  But don't you understand, man, that the beauty of it is the importance of a goal, and it  can happen at any fucking time, mate.  Yes.  You're mixing Cockney English with Australian.  Yeah.  We can start calling football soccer.  You sound like two different idiots. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, it's not, hey, you wouldn't say that.  Say what?  Why don't you fucking with me?  You're drunk, I know it.  Yeah, that must be it.  All right, there you go.  Let's go to Brian in Detroit.  Steve from B. Shore said, that was Crocodile Dummy.  Steve.  Hey, Brian, is it cold in the day?  It's cold.  Yeah, it must be.  Fucking cold, right?  Buffalo is cold, right, Jimmy?  It wasn't that bad, to be honest with you, dude.  It was rainy and chilly, but it was not unbearable. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  It just felt nippy.  Nice little weather forecast.  Yeah, why not?  From Jimmy Norton.  Boy, are they still hardcore up there?  Yeah, I know.  The fucking ONA fans?  Yeah.  I fucking know it, too.  That was great.  The devoid of entertainment.  It's so cold in the deep.  What do you got, Brian?  That movie was so bad, I wish black people were in the theater to ruin it for me.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a distasteful comment.  Maybe you're just like an artist, Sam.  Reservoir Dogs was Lionsgate, but I think it was in association with Miramax. 
[01:19:00]  I think they released it, though.  They just re-released the original.  Did they?  Yeah.  Miramax has that, though, don't they?  I think so.  I don't know.  They're just Lionsgate.  They're awful.  I thought you knew every Lionsgate movie.  D-Boy, what happened?  He likes the opinions.  He doesn't need factual evidence.  He doesn't need to see a movie not to like it.  He doesn't need to remember it.  He fucking loved D-Boy.  He just needs to know what production company put it out.  Yeah, as soon as that little lion flashes on the screen, I just know it's going to be shit.  You see the new... 
[01:19:30]  I like the new logo, though, with the gears.  Yeah.  It's like these metal gear working things, like the inside of a clock, and then it comes out in Lionsgate.  It looks very cool.  Who knows that?  What?  Who knows that?  I just...  I'm a fan of the opening sequence cinematography.  I like the unicorn, and then the little moon settles in the DreamWorks.  Oh, you like the little DreamWorks fucking E.T. kind of a thing?  Whatever's happening, yeah.  With the little kid fishing off the moon?  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Are you a fan of When the Lion Roars?  For MGM?  Yeah.  That's MGM.  That's MGM guy?  Oh, yeah.  Ars gratia artiste.  That's right.  Yes, yes.  Art for art's sake.  All right, that's enough on Paranormal, I guess.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  We've got nothing done here.  One guy likes it a lot.  You should see it.  And by the way, also, Saw 6, thumbs up.  Saw 6?  Thumbs up?  Hell yeah.  What?  Get the fuck out of here.  It's the third best Saw movie.  Enough with Saw fucking movies.  I loved the first one, dealt with the second one, and then after that, go away with the Saw 
[01:20:30]  You gotta get back on the bandwagon.  If it's Halloween, it's Saw.  Shut it.  Well, don't worry, Ann.  If you miss this year's, don't miss next year's Saw 7 when it comes out October 28th.  Yeah, of course.  Saw 6 did leave room for a sequel.  Of course it did.  They can pump those fucking Saw movies out.  Oh, wow.  There's a gadget around someone, and they can't fucking...  They gotta get out of it before something horrible happens.  The first trailer for Saw, I thought, was one of the coolest things I'd ever seen. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Because it didn't really explain anything.  They just showed you some chick with a thing on her face, and it was gonna rip her head  open if she didn't get it off in time.  It was great.  And the first time I saw Saw, the first one, I had no clue.  It was great.  That was the guy in the middle laying there dead the whole time, and he was alive.  That was a great fucking, like, twist.  Twist.  Yes.  Fuck Lionsgate though now.  They're still doing it.  I don't care.  Fuck Lionsgate.  And they take on the banks and healthcare in Saw 6.  Shut up.  They do, I swear.  Oh, God.  Jesus. 
[01:21:30]  A very special Saw.  Yes.  Where Mr. Carlson tries to molest Dudley, who's chained to a fucking plugged-in toaster in the  tub.  Yes.  Fuck that.  You know what?  We gotta make an executive decision today.  Yes.  Sam's good on the air, but not when it comes to movies.  You don't talk movies anymore.  I think D-Boy is now our movie critic.  D-Boy is our new movie reviewer.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, all listeners then.  What was your favorite movie of the last year, Sam?  We'll test you right now. 
[01:22:00]  Your favorite movie of the last year.  Of the last year?  Yeah.  You could go even a little further than that.  One of your stupid Rob Zombie movies, or a wrestler in a movie, something with a rock  in it.  Well, The Wrestler was a very good movie.  Right.  Burn After Reading was a very, very good movie.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Better than No Country for All Men.  I'll put that out there.  Lionsgate didn't put that out?  No.  Oh, good.  Oh, shit.  I almost had to fucking boycott that.  Right.  But, I mean... 
[01:22:30]  He doesn't like Lionsgate.  He's just so fucked.  He is so fucked.  He is the weirdest thing.  I've never known anyone in all my years that wouldn't like a movie because of the fucking  logo that plays before the movie.  I'm finally on board with...  It's brilliant.  I'm finally on board with the D-Boy's a kook thing.  Oh, you gotta love D-Boy.  I was like, what are you guys talking about?  He seems pretty normal.  D-Boy's the best.  He's obsessed with Lionsgate sucking.  I have a list of emails that I've been collecting from D-Boy for the last five years.  Oh, shit.  I don't know what to do with them yet. 
[01:23:00]  Put them in a book.  I think there's something there that his emails that he gives to all of us are just amazing.  Pitch it as a movie to Lionsgate to piss them off.  They're making a movie about you.  You'll hate that, too.  Yeah, give it to Derek.  He'll do something with it.  Fuck it.  He don't care.  He'll produce something with that.  Goddamn, that's great.  All right.  Hey, speaking of other movies, the This Is It.  Sam, are you going to go see This Is It?  Yeah, I will see that.  Why?  Because it looks good.  It's the Michael Jackson thing they put together with a little rehearsal footage. 
[01:23:30]  He dies, so they make a movie out of it.  Who put that on Warner Brothers?  I don't know.  You like that?  It always reminds me.  I keep thinking a cartoon's going to start.  I like that.  The big WB.  Yeah, it gets you all excited.  And then the movie starts.  You're like, what's this?  Yeah.  You know what Michael Jackson's father's saying about This Is It?  Why?  That they use body doubles?  Yeah, he didn't use body doubles.  Because if you remember, when the whole Michael Jackson thing came down, they said he wasn't  in any shape to perform or rehearse for this big tour of his. 
[01:24:00]  And now the movie comes out and it shows that he was in top form.  They didn't use any body doubles.  And Joe Jackson's like, yeah, that's because they used body doubles.  Wow.  Wow.  He would know.  Sure he would.  How would he know?  He punched out from the original enough.  Yeah, it's his own son.  Because they used body doubles when he was torn in 1997.  Because he was scared of the pyrotechnics.  Really?  Joe Jackson said he used body doubles back then.  So when he'd come out on the stage and just kind of do a pose, like a stupid pose and 
[01:24:30]  things would blow up, it wasn't him?  That's what Joe Jackson is saying today.  Michael Jackson's dad has panned This Is It and accused makers of the documentary of  using Jackson body doubles to fool viewers.  Leave it to Columbia Pictures.  Yep.  They're known for body doubles in their movies.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, Columbia's notorious for that.  You've got to think Joe Jackson doesn't get a piece of the action, so of course he's  saying this, right?  This movie features body doubles.  No doubt about it, Joe Jackson told.  Yesterday's edition of London's News of the World.  I think people will tear this movie apart. 
[01:25:00]  What's the woman in the beginning of Columbia Pictures?  Statue of Liberty?  Is it not?  Who is it?  I don't know.  It's a mystery.  It's a fucking mystery.  Mystery for everybody.  Who is she?  And of course, it should be said, the representation for this movie are shutting down that, saying no.  Really?  There were not body doubles, so.  Of course not.  I'll have to judge it for myself, but I don't believe that.  I like the triangle and tri-star.  Ah, yeah.  Oh.  The horse jumping through?  Yeah.  The horse jumping through.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Yes.  We got...  You know what?  It's funny that Jimmy mentioned that, because the next paragraph says, this report is pure 
[01:25:30]  garbage, said Steve Elzer of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group.  Wow.  Wow.  So, there you go.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Columbia always reminds me, the old one, of The Three Stooges, because that would  play before The Three Stooges came on.  I can't believe we're talking movie company.  Well, because you've got to take care of D-Boy.  He hates Lionsgate.  I think we all should be on board.  Fuck Lionsgate and their asses.  No, Lionsgate makes a lot of good movies. 
[01:26:00]  Shut up.  All six-star movies.  Don't they make the WWE movies, someone is saying?  Well, WWE has its own production house now.  So, they don't need Lionsgate?  No, they got WWE films.  Eww.  What's wrong with that?  What dud after dud is going to come out of that fucking...  Overacted movie after overacted movie.  How much money does Vince need?  They switched their shit factory.  He doesn't know the movie business, so he should get one of these movie houses to help  him out.  They switched their business model to mainly focusing on the straight-to-DVD category. 
[01:26:30]  I wonder why.  But The Condemned, starring Stone Cold Steve Austin, was the one movie that I don't care  who you are, that was a good movie.  That's it.  Stop it.  Have you seen it?  And that's why I'll not be talking movies ever again.  But you guys haven't seen it.  Why would we?  How is he good in it?  It was just an awesome movie.  It's awesome.  He just kills a bunch of guys.  He's stuck on an island.  Let me tell you an awesome wrestler movie.  Okay.  They Live Awesome Movie with Roddy Piper.  No, not Awesome 2.  That was awesome. 
[01:27:00]  But you didn't see The Condemned.  I mean, I don't want to see any new wrestler in a movie because...  Stone Cold?  And what's he doing?  What does he play?  He's a guy who is on death row, and they ship death row inmates to an island for a new  reality show where only one gets off the island.  Everybody else has to die.  Cool.  The Running Man.  That sounds really good.  That's good.  Running Man, Con Air, whatever.  Bunch of death row inmates.  Why do they have to be death row inmates?  Death row inmates.  Yes.  What was he, wrongly convicted for something? 
[01:27:30]  He was.  Of course he was.  Of course he was.  Yeah, sure, sure.  What a pile of shite.  I'm wrongly convicted.  God forbid he was a guy who just killed a child while making pornography with him.  Well, he wouldn't be very sympathetic.  Exactly.  He tells me he was wrongly cast.  Yes.  As a fucking actor.  I didn't say he broke new ground.  I said he was awesome.  Yeah.  Why didn't he ever make another movie then, Sam?  He's filming movies right now, as a matter of fact.  He's in Hollywood CA.  What was his name in it?  It's probably some... 
[01:28:00]  I guarantee you, it wasn't fucking, you know, Arnie Frumpkin.  It wasn't some kind of a normal name.  There's gotta be some kind of a tough name.  What was his name?  Yeah.  Tex Punchem.  The movie that Sam's talking about got 60% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.  I don't listen to the critics.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's wrongly convicted.  Abu.  Abu.  What is it?  I want to know who he is. 
[01:28:30]  There he is right there.  Oh, oh, there he is.  Who is he?  Who is he?  By the way, the sign of a shit movie sometimes is the cornball names they give him.  He's only got one name?  What's his name?  Conrad.  Conrad.  Conrad.  Hey, look out.  Here comes Conrad.  That's pretty predictable.  What's the...  Get it, because Conrad...  Oh, Jack Conrad.  Jack Conrad.  We got bad fucking 50s novel.  Detective Jack Conrad here.  How terrible.  Let's see.  Jack Conrad is awaiting the death penalty in a corrupt Central American prison. 
[01:29:00]  See?  He is purchased by a wealthy television producer and taken to a desolate island where he must  fight to the death against nine other condemned killers from all corners of the world with  freedom going to the survivor.  That's right.  It's kind of similar to the Japanese movie Battle Royale, but this one is done with adults.  That one was done with like eighth graders on an island.  Well, that's called fucking, uh, what was that?  Lord of the Flies.  Lord of the Flies, right.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, but they got weapons and stuff, and they blow up. 
[01:29:30]  Lord of the Flies have weapons.  Yeah, but they didn't have bombs.  They have boulders and fucking spears.  Plus, freedom wasn't granted to the sole survivor in Lord of the Flies.  Does Stone Cold do a wrestling move on somebody in the movie?  No, he doesn't do it.  Oh, there's gotta be.  Come on.  That's Jack.  He does the Stone Cold stunner, doesn't he?  But I'll bet he says something really witty after killing someone.  That's for Sherry.  Or some stupid or not.  That's some line.  Does he say, and that's the bottom line?  No, he's not.  No?  He's Jack Conrad, not Stone Cold Steve.  We gotta get lines from this movie. 
[01:30:00]  He's gotta do something.  He's gotta do something Stone Cold-ish.  So the wrestling fans at sea could go, look, he just did what he does in...  Maybe Shakespeare's the fucking Budweiser.  Luckily, I have it on DVD, so I'll be able to find some.  Yeah, but you're gonna pick the good lines.  We want the basic lines from the movie.  They're all good lines.  Alright, that's fine.  The challenge is odd.  Alright, guys, thank you.  That's the movie segment for now.  That's our movie segment.  I liked it.  How was John Cena's movie, by the way?  I mean, that's one where I would say The Condemned would be one that I preferred. 
[01:30:30]  What was John Cena's movie?  Oh, you're smiling.  You didn't like the John...  He's a friend.  He's had two movies.  What were they?  The Marine?  Yeah.  And I think, what's it called?  21, some rounds?  21 rounds?  And he's acting in the commercial for the new game, too.  The Smackdown game.  Where he yells, pulls down the newspaper and yells.  Is it good?  Yeah.  He yells two words, and you can tell what a shit actor.  Can we see that?  He's a friend.  I like John, too, but... 
[01:31:00]  I mean, he's a...  Well, I guess this is what we do to our friends.  That's true.  Yeah, we shit all over him.  Why do we do that?  Hence, we sit here all alone day after day with no guests.  Boy, we wonder why.  He won the title last night.  He's a WWE champion again.  What?  He won the world title.  He won the WWE championship.  Enough of you.  We got some Bernie Madoff news after the break.  I'm so happy about this.  You like this, right, Jimmy?  How do you not?  Don't say another thing.  There's your tease.  And remember Mermaid Girl? 
[01:31:30]  The one with the two feet that were welded together.  We couldn't figure out how she would pee and stuff.  She had, like, one mess where your leg should be.  Here's John Cena at the end.  At the end of what?  Yeah.  What is this?  I don't know.  It's a commercial for...  The new wrestling game?  The game, yeah.  Smackdown vs. Raw.  Who's this?  Morning, Josh.  Made your favorite.  Oh, I created him for a match.  Why is the audio so low today?  Stop creating superstars, Josh.  It's Joshnader.  No.  Can we just go to the end?  I can't watch. 
[01:32:00]  Thanks.  Match today, Cena.  Oh, come on!  Hey there.  That's actually the long version, which is better than the short version.  Wow, that bad.  You notice in the end he's kind of giving his mind away.  Oh, come on!  Hither.  That's good.  Good switch.  All right, listen.  The energy just left the room, Sam.  I want to see...  Which one of his movies did you prefer least? 
[01:32:30]  Oh, my God.  We're still talking about John Cena.  Oh, my God.  Let's just cut our losses.  Come on.  N-word has to eat.  I guess...  Yeah, let's just go to break.  The Marine might have been better.  I'm not sure which one I preferred over the other.  Yeah, I bet.  Is the only thing.  These guys have lines from The Condemned.  John and P.A.  John.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, one of the famous lines on there, they asked Stone Cold where he was from, and he 
[01:33:00]  said, a little town called Fuck Your Mother.  See?  I actually don't mind that.  That's kind of rough.  It's an R-rated movie.  It's a good movie.  A little town called Fuck Your Mother.  I actually like that line.  Yeah, right.  Yes.  Not bad.  Do you know what Kenny says, by the way, when people ask him where he's from?  What?  It's the greatest...  Wait.  Let Kenny tell you where he's from.  Okay, because he's an adult.  Kenny?  Oh, here he comes.  Please.  I know he's running in.  Kenny, where are you from?  I'm from Decimal Point, Long Island. 
[01:33:30]  Where's that?  It's way out.  It's a very small, affluent community.  Every time people ask where he's from.  Decimal Point.  It's a small...  Because there are a lot of points on Long Island.  Yeah, yeah.  Montauk, Orient, Kings.  But it's a small, affluent community.  Affluent community.  Why is he turning red?  Decimal Point.  I've never seen Kenny turn red before.  That's very funny.  You are an ass.  I love it.  It's a very small, affluent community.  Affluent.  There's no reason for that. 
[01:34:00]  Because somebody will go, where are you guys from?  I'm raising Jersey.  Decimal Point, Long Island.  And it's a very small, affluent community.  Affluent community.  Very good.  Another guy has a condemned line.  Mike and Stoney Point.  Even though we're trying to go to break here.  What do you got, Mike?  Stoney Point, see?  It's like, that's...  Hey, what's up, boys?  I got the best line from that movie.  Yeah.  The winner, Jack Conrad.  The winner, Jack Conrad.  All right. 
[01:34:30]  It's a good place to leave off, I think.  I'm looking at Willem Dafoe's awful fucking hairdo on PIX11.  Holy shit.  Where do you see it?  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  That is terrible.  Oh, wow.  We had him on once.  Yeah, he was good.  He never came back.  Oh, why would he?  We had a good time with him.  We had a horrible movie to promote for him.  Mick Foley was in that movie.  He looked better running for the chopper in Platoon.  Yes.  Jesus.  I try to like that movie, too.  Oh, it's fucking stunk.  I've opened bags of shit that had a nicer fucking smell in that movie.  It was horrendous. 
[01:35:00]  We had to fake it.  Bunch of phony balonies.  Ah, good job.  I thought it was good.  Fucking weasels.  We always get these big stars when they're promoting the worst movie they ever made.  They're shit movies, right.  I don't understand that.  Why can't they come in for the good stuff?  For the good movies.  Poops and shoots and ladders.  I don't know what the fuck this is.  Oh.  Oh, I know what this is.  Is it bad?  I mentioned it.  Steve has been trying to shove this one down our trots for a while now.  It's just kids playing a game.  Oh, no.  It's bad.  It's just kids playing a game.  We'll go on a break with this, and we'll continue. 
[01:35:30]  I'm bored.  Yeah, me too.  I hate rainy days.  I got a game for you.  Who the hell are you?  Shut up.  What's that you're holding?  It's a new game.  Poops, shoots, and ladders.  That doesn't look like fun.  Quiet.  Yeah, and you smell like whiskey.  Ah, fuck this.  Let's play another game.  It's called Fuck, Fuck, Goose.  Everybody get in a circle.  But there's only two of us.  Shut up.  I'm calling the police.  Ah, fuck this.  Who the hell was that? 
[01:36:00]  I don't know, but I'm scared.  Poops, shoots, and ladders.  And Fuck, Fuck, Goose.  Fun for the whole family.  From your friends at Parental Games.  Parental Games.  Oh, my fanny.  We can crank this up a little bit.  It's Opie and Anthony starring little Jimmy Norton.  I got a hello from, um, I was in the United Airlines lounge.  I had to fly United back to Buffalo. 
[01:36:30]  And, uh, you know, four hour delay because the flight was canceled.  As opposed to the last flight when they lost my fucking luggage.  Great airline.  But, um, and I see a black man just staring at me, smiling.  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, uh, you know, did I know you were the wig at one point?  And, uh, it was Ian Smith.  It was Ian Smith.  And he's bald now.  I didn't recognize him.  Oh, fucking Ian Smith.  How's he doing?  He's living in Chicago now.  That's why he hasn't been around.  And, uh, he says, excuse me, he says, uh, it overcomes me when I'm kissing sometimes, too.  He says hello, and, uh, he's doing great, and you look great, and, you know. 
[01:37:00]  Shaved his head?  Yeah, he said, Kate Fenn's actually a really nice guy.  He's like, man, it's amazing what the media.  Tells you, because he's like, the guy's the sweetest guy.  Like, he said, uh, you know, the show's going well.  He's part of Celebrity Fit Club, this K-Fed, right?  I bet he's amazing.  He's a really nice dude.  Right on, man.  Dr. Ian Smith is a big star now.  Yes, he is.  He's just a local fucking guy on TV here in New York.  Yep.  Now, did you step up to him, or did he step up to you?  I was sitting there in the lounge.  I had a nightmare experience with United again.  And, uh...  Why did they cancel a flight? 
[01:37:30]  Mechanical problems.  Oh, well, you want them to do that.  So, on the way, Kenny called me, 520 LA time.  He goes, they canceled...  Better on the ground than...  His face.  Fucking Rickles' face in Casino when he tells that Japanese guy that the planes broke.  And he goes, better here on the ground than...  And points and looks up in the...  Best face ever.  So, they canceled my flight, and I go into the first class United Lounge, and it's the  International Lounge. 
[01:38:00]  And, um...  So, I walk up to the lady after, because some guy lets me in.  And she's like, well, are you flying International?  I'm like, no.  And she's like, well, you're not supposed to be in here.  I'm like, well, they canceled my flight and wrecked my day by four and a half hours,  so I figured they were just being courteous.  And she says, we don't use this lounge as an amenity for canceled flights.  But I guess since somebody let you in...  She was like the cunty lady.  How bad did you want to just throw hot coffee in your face?  Dude, I wanted to spit in her face.  If she would have said to leave, there would have been a problem with me at the airport.  I was so aggravated. 
[01:38:30]  And you know what?  There's nothing special in those fucking lounges to begin with.  No.  Maybe a chair that you could actually sit on, because there's less people.  That's about it.  It was a 15-hour travel day, because United fucked up.  And she had to fucking rub it in even more.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, I was so...  It was like the mom in a bad 80s movie.  Like, I was the kid from across the tracks who wanted to bang the hot daughter.  Or, you're not from around here, bub.  Fucking...  You're Laura Dern's parents in mask.  Come, let's go now. 
[01:39:00]  No, I'm mask.  She's Laura Dern's parents.  Yes.  You said I was Laura Dern's parents.  Oh, well, you could be, too.  No, I don't know.  She's the greatest.  She's not home, big head.  Mom says I look like a lion.  No, you don't.  Here he is.  Come here, meet my parents.  And they're like, oh, Christ, what's this monster walking over here?  Oh, shit, that's him.  Favorite things, the sun on my face.  Sun on my face.  Things I hate.  The sun on my face. 
[01:39:30]  The sun and the darkness on my face, because it's so big, it covers all time zones.  I hate the sun on the right side and the darkness on the left.  Eclipse head.  My whore mother.  Yes, the bikers who molest me after they do crank.  The bikers who do crank and then fuck my face angrily for hours at a time.  Oh, look what happened to a crystal meth-lined womb.  That fucking monstrosity came out. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, Rocky Dennis.  Fucking great movie.  Trying to sleep.  So what happened in the international, is there more to that story?  That's pretty much it.  No, no, no.  Just that she was the gatekeeper and didn't want to let you in.  Well, I was already in, and that's why she didn't ask me to leave.  I was really nasty to her, though.  Good.  Good for you.  Fuck you.  It's like, you canceled my flight, and the last flight before that, they fucking lost my luggage.  What a shit airline.  But at least they had pillows and blankets in first.  Continental yanked them. 
[01:40:30]  They yanked the pillows and blankets from first class.  Fucking asshole airlines, man.  And that's going to make the difference?  Make up the difference?  It's amazing.  We understand they're having a tough time, but how does that make up the difference?  Because other airlines did it, so then they did it.  I love how they're charging for luggage now.  Who doesn't travel with luggage?  It should be part of the deal.  Yeah.  I'm flying somewhere.  I bought a ticket on your airline.  Can you please take my clothes, too?  I'm Mr. Carry-On now, man.  Me, too.  I am Mr. Fucking Carry-On.  That's the easiest thing to do.  Captain Carry-On. 
[01:41:00]  That's what they call me.  But still, I mean, come on.  That's just ridiculous.  Yeah, it is.  It's stupid.  I always travel with beach balls, so I have to pack them in my suitcase.  I have sometimes eight to ten beach balls, because I want my room to feel festive when  I arrive.  That'll do it.  But it will.  As a society, as a society, how do we allow this shit to happen?  That's what confuses me.  Because you've got to fly, and they've got control over everything.  I like going to sporting events when, you know, the old days, you bought a ticket. 
[01:41:30]  I know we've done this break a lot, but it just drives me nuts.  You buy a ticket to a sporting event, and you used to just park.  Look, because you bought the ticket to see their thing.  Oh, yeah.  So they should be providing parking.  No.  That's like inviting someone to your house and saying, oh, you can't park in my driveway.  If you pay me, I'll let you park in my driveway.  But you invited me to your house, Anthony Cumia.  I should be able to park in your driveway.  Just give me a great idea.  What are you doing for Halloween, by the way?  Big Halloween party.  I do believe I'm trying to get a Halloween party together. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, at the house.  I have a costume.  Oh, you do?  A costume?  What costume?  Well, then you'll know it's me if I tell you, won't you?  Oh, no.  That would be wonderful.  What a pleasure it would be to have Ted Sheckler at the house.  If you have a Halloween party, you'll never recognize Ted, though, because you might not  be able to see his face, and you won't know who he is.  Oh, really?  That's right. 
[01:42:30]  But just because of the mustache?  I don't have a mustache.  I need one.  I would love to get a mustache.  The mustache.  If you start growing it now, you'll look silly.  Believe me.  Actually, if I didn't have to do Leno Thursday, I would shave my head into Uncle Paul and be  Uncle Paul, but I can't do it because I've got to do fucking Hannity Tonight and Red Eye  tomorrow and then Leno Thursday.  It's a busy TV week for the motherfucking kid.  Wow, you are on the tube.  Busy week for the motherfucking kid.  On the tube.  They're all fighting for you, Jimmy.  No, they're not.  They all just settled this week.  No. 
[01:43:00]  No.  I wonder who's on Hannity Tonight.  All right.  Let's move on.  So, oh, speaking of aeroplanes, what the fuck is the latest on that flight that went  150 miles past the airport?  Well, they interviewed.  They're all coming out saying, fuck no, we weren't sleeping.  Yeah, they interviewed the pilots.  Was there a broad pilot?  Was there a broad and a guy?  Was there some funny business going on?  I don't know.  I was thinking that, but I didn't know.  They didn't say.  I don't know. 
[01:43:30]  What do you think happened?  They said they were trying to get their attention with bells and whistles and there were some  knocking at the door.  I'm thinking snoozing.  Yeah, I think they went to sleep.  Fell asleep, overshot the runway or overshot the airport.  But that doesn't make sense either because you would wake up if there's a big alarm going  off in the cockpit.  That would be your alarm clock.  What alarm?  Well, I would assume if there's some kind of alarm that goes off in the cockpit, it's  pretty impressive.  It's not a quiet little one that slowly wakes you up and slowly alerts you. 
[01:44:00]  I don't think there's an alarm clock in there that you set to wake up.  No, but I'm saying they wouldn't even wake up when they were trying to alert them.  Oh, well, maybe they had their fucking headphones off.  Who knows?  I don't understand either.  All I'm saying is this doesn't make sense.  Sounds like some mouth fucking was going on up there.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Little mouth fucking.  Yep.  That's what the mainstream media is not going to tell you.  Nope.  That's what I'll say.  I think it was mouth fucking going off.  Well, the FAA knows now because they talked to him, but they're not letting out any info 
[01:44:30]  yet.  Why?  Well, what was the official reason for the pilot?  They said they were doing coke and they spilled some on the rug and they fucking overshot the  airport and they're sorry.  They said they were having a heated discussion about something pilot related.  Couldn't they wait until they were on the ground?  Well, you know, and it took them out of the whole, you know, let's fly the plane to the  destination part of the flight.  What could you have been arguing about?  Yeah.  Wings.  That's more important than not running out of gas. 
[01:45:00]  Wings are good.  Yes.  No, they're not.  One guy thinks.  Yes, they are.  The one guy thinks they should just be shot like a cannonball and land on a giant rubber  thing at their destination.  The other guy thinks the way we're doing it now is just dandy.  It's fine.  And the other guy goes, no, it will cut down on fuel if they shoot us out of a cannon and  we land on a rubber thing and we bounce.  They probably just had some horrendous discussion, arguments. 
[01:45:30]  It could have been an argument, but.  Wind shears or something.  Something stupid.  No, I'm thinking if they were trying to get in touch with them and couldn't and someone  knocked on the door and couldn't get them, they were probably fast asleep.  But here's the latest that came out today.  We were not asleep.  We were not having an argument.  We were not having a fight, Cole said.  But we're not discussing why it took so long for him and the flight captain to respond to  radio calls.  But they were discussing the validity of interracial marriages. 
[01:46:00]  The one guy was saying it should be tolerated.  The other guy was saying it's a blight against God and society.  And they were fighting, arguing about that.  And they don't want to say it.  Right.  At least it was worth it.  Or something really politically incorrect they can't admit.  We were talking about Asian cocks.  All right?  You got us.  Are they as big as black cocks?  We say no.  What the fuck is this about?  They have the black box recording.  Right.  So they can hear what was going on or what wasn't going on.  If it's dead silence for the whole time, you know they were so here. 
[01:46:30]  I'll suck your cock.  Imagine the feeling, though.  Like you're fucking up there and you're asleep and realize, oh, my God, we overshot the airport  by 150 miles.  How are we going to explain this?  How about the dumb passengers in the back just smiling?  Right.  Watching the movies with their headphones on.  And there's the people in charge of the plane.  The plane is now just running itself.  It's just 400. 
[01:47:00]  Hurdling through the cosmos with two fucking guys sleeping guys there.  I mean, you fall asleep for a split second on the highway.  When you wake up, you're in a complete panic.  You don't know how long you were asleep.  Yeah.  Try to figure out where you are.  They were asleep.  You're so overshooting.  You got to start looking at some shit and go, were you asleep?  I was asleep.  Holy shit.  Where are we?  Holy shit.  We're so far.  Oh, my God.  125 miles.  Turn this fucking thing around.  Oh, we are so far.  How much fucking fuel do we have?  Yeah.  Did we? 
[01:47:30]  Was it a long flight?  I don't know.  I think it was.  I'm not sure.  They always have enough to circle for a while or divert, but you better have enough fuel.  You imagine if it was LAX and you overshot into the Pacific.  That happened not too long ago, too.  And that's the worst because there's nowhere to land.  And then you're just like looking around.  Whoa, fuck a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hope that's a big pool or we're fucked.  What happened to California?  It finally cracked off and fell into the ocean.  I hope.  Just shows you how easy it is to fly, though, right? 
[01:48:00]  Just shows you how easy it is to fly.  Oh, on autopilot?  Well, whatever the fuck they're doing up there for.  San Diego to Minnesota.  That's a long flight.  Yep.  They were asleep.  It's probably thermite paint on the controls.  They probably made a deal.  Idiot.  They probably made the deal like, you fall asleep.  I got this.  And then the other guy that was supposed to be awake said, oh, fuck.  I can't.  I'm done.  I'm tired.  Like Junior in Platoon.  They probably said, look, I could fall asleep for 10 minutes on autopilot.  I'm just going to fucking fall asleep for a few minutes here. 
[01:48:30]  A little quick cat nap.  What?  This guy gave me a book to read, but it smells like fucking, like it was in a  room with French fries.  Ew.  Who's the guy?  I don't know.  He was a fan.  Smell this book.  It's not.  Creep.  Just like fan it at yourself.  Like flick the pages at yourself.  It's a smelly book.  That book stinks.  I want to read it, actually.  It's not disgusting.  It just smells like something that's had food next to it. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, God.  It's like mildewy, though, too.  It sounds like it was in somebody's car, and they just ate in their car and smoked in  their car.  Yeah.  I don't want a smelly book.  A bunch of French fries dried up under the seat.  Isn't that what it smells like?  Maybe the book was in a flood.  No, it's not that type of mildew.  No?  No.  It smells horrible.  I know.  Why couldn't he have had it under a girl's vagina?  What?  It smells like Heinean vagina.  Oh, good.  I'll read this.  I'm in.  More info.  Bert in Delaware.  Bert?  What up, Bert?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  I got an idea for you.  I think they said that the cocktail recorders only recorded the last half hour. 
[01:49:30]  I think they fucked up somehow.  And I realized they got to burn another hour before they can't retreat whatever they were  doing up there.  All right.  What?  That stopped that topic.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, Madoff.  What do we got on Madoff's billionaire friend here?  Well, you love these stories.  Happily.  I think most of us love these stories.  Yep.  Happily, the guy that made $7 billion, I think. 
[01:50:00]  I think that's the quote off of Madoff's scheme.  Was found floating face first, dead in his pool.  Oh.  And good.  In Palm Beach, Florida.  Good.  Suspicious or not?  Don't know.  Palm Beach Fire Department told ABC News that Pekauer, it looks like, had no pulse when  fire rescue workers arrived at the oceanfront mansion.  After his wife called 911, she and his housekeeper pulled his body from the pool shortly after  noon.  Goody.  Bye-bye.  I think it's a coincidence.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe he had a heart attack while he was swimming or whatever.  He would have benefited more from the Madoff's scheme than this guy, Pekauer, according to 
[01:50:30]  bankruptcy lawyers who sued him and alleged he had taken over $7 billion more than he  had put in.  So maybe he had a bunch of stress knowing they were looking into his finance.  Hopefully he was ready to go to jail and then he just fucking had a heart attack and  fell bald face first right into that pool and died.  Fucking prick.  It's over Johnny's.  And he was going to face criminal charges.  So maybe he fucking killed himself.  Yeah.  I hope so.  These guys should, I'm telling you, the penalty for these guys should be they should be shot  to the fucking knees. 
[01:51:00]  They should really be dealt with harshly.  That would hurt Jimmy.  That's too much pain.  He made 30 times what Madoff did from the scam and about a third of the missing money  went to Pekauer.  Holy shit, this guy made a bootload.  He's like, oh, fuck yourself, everybody else.  I made money.  He's dead.  Dead?  He's dead.  And so is Mermaid Girl.  Oh, that mermaid thing?  I think she made it to 10 years old.  How old?  She was born with her legs fused together.  So we couldn't figure out how she pooped and teed. 
[01:51:30]  10 years old?  I believe so.  How'd she go to the bathroom?  I don't know.  We asked all these questions at the time.  They cut the legs apart though, right?  Did they?  Yeah, they did like an operation.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Before we move on to another story, there's a couple good phone calls.  Oh, oh.  We're going to start with Andrew and then we're going to go to Adam in Kansas City.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, gentlemen.  Hey, by the way, I know, but I have to say it.  The game of the week was that fucking Steelers game yesterday.  Absolutely.  We showed Brett Favre where he stands in the world. 
[01:52:00]  Well, he got fucked on a bad call with that weird tripping call, but whatever.  Congratulations to you Steeler fans out there.  What do you got, Andrew?  I'm a pilot and I just want to point out that this falling asleep shit happens all the time.  Crossing the pond, crossing the country, one of you stays awake, answers the radios, the  other one takes cat naps.  And when you think about 150 miles in the context of an airplane, you're moving eight miles a  minute.  So that's really only 18 to 20 minutes that they were both out.  So you're hopefully admitting as a pilot that you guys do make deals and go, okay, you sleep 
[01:52:30]  for a while, I'll fly this day.  Absolutely.  I'm in the military and we keep really bad hours.  They keep us going constantly.  So I don't know.  I can't speak for the civilians, but this happens almost every time.  It's not, um, it's, it's, it's known that that's done though, isn't it?  It's like common practice.  Right.  That's really not an issue.  Usually.  Yeah.  Usually somebody stays awake.  Yeah.  As long as someone's at the controls.  Well, that's, but that's what we're thinking now.  So they made that deal. 
[01:53:00]  You nap for a little while.  And the, the guy that said I could stay awake obviously couldn't.  They, they were asleep.  Come on.  What else was happening?  In the old days, they had like the, the fucking captain and then the first officer and a navigator  and a communications guy.  So they knocked all those guys out, right?  The fucking flight decks were huge.  Yeah.  And, uh, then, uh, then now there's, you know, two guys up there.  That's it.  Eh, a little, a little more of a chance of, uh, both of them snoozing.  Sure.  Uh, let me go to Adam in Kansas City.  Adam.  Anthony, will you please do the bit where the pilot wakes up thinking everything's okay? 
[01:53:30]  Uh, uh, uh.  Do we have any airline, airplane noises?  Airplane noises.  All right, here we go.  Oh, oh shit.  Oh, God, was I tired?  Oh, I gotta, do I have work today?  Is it Saturday? 
[01:54:00]  No, I think it's, yeah.  All right.  I'm gonna sleep in a little bit.  Holy shit, am I worth flying a plane?  Where the fuck am I?  Holy shit, I was sleeping.  Oh, my God.  You know that's what happens when you freak out.  You know what, as funny as that is, you know that's probably exactly what happens.  He starts checking his fucking GPS and shit.  You think the two pilots are crying at each other? 
[01:54:30]  Like, oh, we're so fucked.  Wake up, you asshole.  What are you doing?  You said you were gonna stay awake, you fuck.  The other guy just wakes up like, what?  What?  What?  Because he hears the other guy screaming.  Don't let me catch you fucking Z's.  Yeah.  I'm a Z's on firewatch.  And a flat deck.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet you don't even think I'm flying.  I bet your first instinct, your first thought are childlike.  Like, you wake up and you see clouds, you're like, I'm in the sky.  Oh, all right.  This is what I do for a living.  The sky. 
[01:55:00]  Puffy looks like a dragon.  I'm a blade.  We got another pilot checking in.  This is not good for people that are scared to fly.  Go ahead, Peter.  Hey, good evening, boys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, I'm a civilian pilot.  I fly for an airline and we fall asleep a lot.  Usually, you'll take turns.  But especially if you're changing time zones a lot, you go to bed late and get up early.  One guy will just kind of take a cat nap while the other guy monitors the radios. 
[01:55:30]  How long is a cat nap?  It depends on the flight.  If it's a couple hours, you'll probably knock out for about 10, 20 minutes.  But you kind of fit the internal check.  I'm sure one of the guys is paying attention.  So, you know, you don't.  They do it in Europe, actually.  It's a practice that's allowed in Europe.  They have all these checks where the flight attendant will knock on the door every 10 minutes or so to make sure.  But there's been a lot of talk about them doing it here in the U.S. now because it's something that happens and they've got to deal with it, especially after the Colby crash. 
[01:56:00]  We're talking about fatigue and whatnot.  I don't want to know that you guys are falling asleep like we do when we road trip and you tell your front door.  You can drive, right?  I'm going to sleep.  I think you tell the story about your brother Joe and you wake up and he's sleeping, too.  That shit's going on in the air.  So, yeah, it happens.  So I think eventually they're going to pass something that will allow us to do it legally.  But it happens.  So punch out, boys.  I know on some long, long flights, they save a bed or like one of the first class seats for the pilots to go in and sleep if they want. 
[01:56:30]  X amount of time.  I forget what the distance is.  Maybe 12-hour flights.  I assume the one guy that's left is wide awake.  I'm guessing they have three guys on those flights.  There's only going to be two guys in the cockpit.  Fuck me.  Can't just be one guy.  Let's go to Nova Scotia.  James.  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Very much.  This happens more than you think.  And you're making it sound like a big deal, but really it's not. 
[01:57:00]  If you figure it's an A320, it's at altitude.  It cruises at 460 knots, which is around 8 miles a minute.  It gets a tailwind, which gives it another 2 miles a minute.  So really it's doing about 10 miles a minute, so it's 15 minutes.  At the later stage of flight, the first officer is doing all the paperwork in order to give when he lands.  And the aircraft commander is either reading a book or has missed the radio transfer from air traffic control.  And in 15 minutes, it's like the virtual blink of an eye in a long flight, and they go, holy shit. 
[01:57:30]  And when they scramble to find out what frequency they should have been on, it's easy to get 150 miles.  I've seen it happen a lot.  Yeah, but think of it this way.  Shouldn't they have been descending then?  No.  Eight minutes out?  They shouldn't have been descending?  Well, you see, the problem is the A320 is probably the most automated airplane in the sky.  And the old joke was the new crew on an A320 is one dog and one pilot. 
[01:58:00]  The pilot's there to feed the dog, and the dog there is to bite the pilot if he touches any buttons.  I like that.  So, you know, they do automatic landing and take-off, and they've become so acclimated to the aircraft doing its own descent profile that all they've become is human backups for the computer.  So they're talking around doing their paperwork and realize, holy shit, they forgot to flick the button to start the flight management system approach, and there we are stuck at altitude.  Like, I worked at an airport where, you know, the guy should be around 3,200 to 2,200 feet on approach, and there you see him going over the top at 30,000 feet. 
[01:58:30]  You're going, hello?  Oh, shit.  And it does happen more than you think, but it's not a case of asleep or arguing.  More likely, they missed the frequency from the last sector to new sector and weren't paying attention to what was going on.  But how did the computer on autopilot not know that they had overflown? 
[01:59:00]  Because at some point, you have to go from in-flight on autopilot.  Autopilot will go forever at altitude, as long as you don't touch anything.  But there comes a certain coordinate where you say, okay, at this point, do what's called an FMS approach.  He flicks the button, and the aircraft does its own descent, its own turn, right down to the pavement.  So he missed the cue.  So, you know, it's called situational awareness is what it's called a business.  He had none, or both of them had none. 
[01:59:30]  But it's only a blink of a time.  You're talking about 15 minutes that they overflow, and it would have taken them that long to get down.  Let me ask you, can the plane actually land itself?  Absolutely.  It's called an ALS, an automatic landing system.  And we always used to joke about it as controllers that says, you know, after the pilot hears the screeching the tires, he puts a newspaper down and says, hello, welcome to.  And let me ask you, are you a pilot or you're in air traffic?  I was in air traffic.  I had my pilot's pilot's license, but that scared the shit out of me, so I stayed on the other side of the microphone. 
[02:00:00]  Do you guys get nervous?  When I took off from Buffalo, it was an Embraer, a 51-seater, so it's a jet.  But a little bumpy taking off.  Do you guys get nervous when you're going through turbulence?  No, you know, a lot of people that know me don't fly anymore because I tell them all these horror stories.  And they say, you know, a takeoff is defined as brute force over ignorance, and a landing is a controlled crash.  So, I mean, they just apply more power.  And you're going to get some thermals, especially when you're around the city, because you get some convective activity off the pavement, off the runway. 
[02:00:30]  So that's why you get the kick in the ass, and that's why it's smooth once you get at altitude.  But it's the nature of the beast, especially the small aircraft, because a small thermal will hurt you more.  But you guys aren't scared as a pilot when you're flying and you're bumping around.  You know it's coming, so it's not a big deal.  No, and the other thing is, too, if you've ever flown in the front of a jet.  Now, before 9-11, we were allowed to go up on familiarization flights, so we knew how the other half of the family lived.  And the most smoothest part is in the nose of the aircraft, because everything else is getting the yaw. 
[02:01:00]  They don't appreciate how much the bumps are getting in the back, because the point pretty much stays level, and the rest of the ass gets thrown around.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, true. They're at the, like, pivot point.  You know, when they see the stewardess come up banging his purse on the door, that's when they know.  Banging his purse.  This guy's a scream.  My manager flew, I think it was, like, Cafe Pacific or Singapore, and he said recently that they have, or it might have been Emirates, 
[02:01:30]  they have a camera under the fucking plane and in the front of the plane, so you can monitor it and watch.  You can watch the plane take off.  You can watch the plane fly and look below.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Yeah, and that's scarier than Payday, too, because they used to have, and I think United still does,  and I know how much a big fan of United, you can listen to the conversation with the pilots in the air traffic controller.  And I got in trouble one time, flying from San Francisco to Chicago and United, sitting there in my seat, 
[02:02:00]  my headset set on, not realizing I was talking out loud, going, well, that's wrong.  Well, that's wrong.  He said, what? Hey, what are you doing?  You know, so you're doing a critique of the pilot flying, and the stewardess is saying, yes, sir, what's wrong?  You know.  Well, the, uh.  Amazing.  How long have you been in air traffic?  I just retired.  I did 31 years.  Jesus.  How did you, let me, how did you guys do it before computers now?  Before there were computers, like, say, 1970 or before there were, what did you guys do?  It was scary, because you had to do a lot of memory work.  All you were getting was slashes and stuff on the scope, and you had to keep what was called flight progress strips. 
[02:02:30]  So you had to write like crazy to memory work.  And then as computers came in, you had a whole wealth of data that some of the shit you didn't really need,  but it sort of kept it all together for you.  But, uh, and that's why you don't have to build any more airports, per se, like they did back in the 40s to 50s,  because the computers have allowed air traffic to tighten up the amount of planes you put in any area without compromising safety. 
[02:03:00]  So you've allowed to saturate the skies and shorten the margin between airplanes,  and that's what computer technology has done for you.  You guys, back to those days, there should have been a crash every day.  Oh, hell yeah.  All right, hold on.  A lot of people are saying, uh, Bravo Sierra on this guy.  Nah, I believe this guy.  I do, too.  He knows too much.  Let's see what happens here.  We got a pilot on the phone.  Bob, uh, in Virginia.  You're on with James from Nova Scotia.  Go ahead, Bob. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, how you doing?  You know, I'm an airline pilot.  I fly domestically and internationally.  And one of the things we laugh at, I mean, the guy's near traffic controller.  He knows certainly part of the industry, but he's not a pilot, and he's certainly not an airline pilot.  But he may know a little bit about the Airbus, but, you know, when we're on our airplanes  and we're seeing the passengers come on board, we always laugh at the guy that comes on.  We're in a baseball cap that says, pilot.  And this is, you know, he's one of those guys that it sounds like that.  A lot of his stuff is just way, way in balance. 
[02:04:00]  What's he wrong about?  Tell us.  Aircrafts are highly automated, there's no doubt about that.  I fly one of the most advanced 737s that's ever been produced.  And I do coast-to-coast stuff, backs out of the clock, completely against circadian rhythm.  And it's a very difficult thing for the human body.  And, unfortunately, we are, you know, we're slaves to what the company can schedule us to do legally,  which isn't always the safest thing to do. 
[02:04:30]  And even though the aircraft are highly automated, the pilots, they have to put all the information in,  and they have to tell it to do everything it's going to do.  So, wait, are you saying this?  That's what I said.  What I said was when an autopilot, you're going to make a transition to an FMS approach.  It doesn't do that.  And are you telling me in your career you never missed a radio call from a near-traffic control from one sector to another?  I don't know, absolutely.  We miss radio calls all the time.  That's what I'm saying.  So I was offended by the pilots by saying that they weren't arguing, they weren't asleep. 
[02:05:00]  They probably missed a radio call.  And that's how come they, you know, that's easy to do.  I've seen it happen a lot.  And I never missed a radio call, but I don't miss radio calls.  I wasn't eligible.  I'd like to hear this discussion actually on the air while they're flying.  Now we know why the pilot oversat the...  Listen, you fucking asshole.  I'm flying this thing.  What do you think?  Probably just argue with air traffic control.  Doesn't it sound?  So what, you both acknowledge that the other one is legit, right?  Oh, yeah.  You know, he sounds like somebody that would say, uh... 
[02:05:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, here we go.  Whatever.  You know, that's the air traffic control is against the pilot.  And I guess that's always going to be a bone of contention somewhere.  But one of you here, O&A, was right.  We do start a descent well before the airport.  If we're 37,000 feet approaching the airport, our procedure is we brief the descent procedures that we're following.  And we follow usually a very predetermined descent profile that goes to the airport,  where we then switch to a very determined approach profile, which then takes us down to the runway. 
[02:06:00]  Which is now an SMS approach.  So if they didn't miss the radio call...  5% of the landings are done by the pilot.  It's very rare that pilots do an auto land where the aircraft lands itself.  That's what I said.  The fun of my job is taking off and landing.  That's the funnest thing I'm going to do.  I'm not going to sit there and let the airplane land itself every time.  We do that on a regular basis to make sure the aircraft's mechanical capabilities are up to speed, 
[02:06:30]  and it can do it when it needs to do it or when our procedures call for it to be done.  But we land the airplane.  And in order to leave 30,000 feet to get to our airport and be at an altitude where we can begin an approach profile all the way down to the runway,  we twist in and dial in the altitude we want the airplane to then go to and tell the computer to switch modes.  And we're doing that miles and miles out. 
[02:07:00]  No kidding.  Like, usually you start your descent profile from the mid-30,000 more than 150 miles back,  especially on an SMS approach where you want to determine the best use of gas and the best pilot comfort.  I understand that.  My point was at the start of this, by simply missing a radio call and being distracted for a short period of time  could lead to this pilot being off course.  I was having a little fun at your expense.  Get over it.  Yeah, you're right about that.  It could have been a simple one-miss call, and there are just discussions in the cockpit, 
[02:07:30]  and it's easy to miss that.  And at some point you are going to look down and say, holy crap, where are we at the airport behind us?  I don't dispute that at all.  But as far as the level of participation in a cockpit for what the pilot is doing with the airplane,  no, we fly the airplanes.  And a lot of times when we're flying the airplanes, you know, airplanes are very complex pieces of machinery.  A lot of times certain things in there don't work.  Can I point out, this is degenerating to the pilot going, it's hard, you know? 
[02:08:00]  We've all been in that position in our lives.  What I do is hard.  Because you have nothing else.  Isn't that a joke that the crew of an Airbus is a dog and a pilot?  Like, I just invented that.  You've never heard that before?  That's a freaking hilarious joke.  Absolutely.  And as the airbus, you heard a lot about that.  But, you know, it's like your computer at home.  If you put a bunch of crap into your computer at home, it's not going to do anything.  All right, excuse me, I've got to jump in for a second because Brian Poughkeepsie has a very good idea. 
[02:08:30]  I mean, you guys are going back and fighting and stuff.  After you make your point, can you please say over?  Please.  We never say over.  No, it's never over.  I've got to ask the pilot something, though.  Don't you also, because I've noticed this on Approach a lot of times,  if there's a lot of thunderclouds and whatnot, you guys will kind of weave through them  and find clear air in between the clouds. 
[02:09:00]  Absolutely.  You know, the updraft and downdraft and turbulence inside of a towering cumulus type of thunderstorm  can be very severe.  Yeah, so you guys kind of avoid those.  It's part of our operating standard.  We are required to maintain a certain distance from those clouds because of that.  And that's why you'll see them doing that, weaving all over the place,  you know, both climbing out and descending.  They really don't want to be going through the clouds.  It's just too bumpy and uncomfortable for everybody on the aircraft. 
[02:09:30]  The aircraft can handle it.  All right.  Thank you.  We're going to hand you off now to, I guess, your wife or girlfriend.  Thanks a lot.  Hey, what do you guys think of Sully, what he did?  That guy was, like, cool.  He just pissed a button and the fucking plane landed in the water.  Exactly.  The dog was pissing.  He pressed it.  He handed the dog the paper.  That's it.  We got a little joke.  It's called a pool party.  Everybody gets out.  Their feet get wet. 
[02:10:00]  I love this.  This has gotten into pilots are faggots.  Air traffic controllers eat shit.  The war between these two.  But the bottom line is, the pilot will always get more pussy than the air traffic controller.  That's right.  Absolutely.  The pilot goes, absolutely.  Hey, Anthony, do you know what you call a 300-pound air traffic controller?  What?  The skinny guy.  Why do you guys hate each other?  Don't you have to work together?  This is hysterical. 
[02:10:30]  These two are depending on each other.  This isn't good.  I don't want to fly anytime soon.  I love this.  Why is there such animosity?  Did you hear why Sully had to walk the cabin twice after that put down in the Hudson?  Why?  He was looking for a free newspaper.  The pilots in their newspapers.  Air traffic controllers with their food.  They have no respect for each other.  The air traffic controller, we shit on ourselves, too. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, I got the greatest respect for these guys.  It's the best job you can get sitting down all day doing nothing.  But, you know, it's a good deal.  Hey, it's back to you, air traffic controller.  That was me.  It's just a little self-deprecation.  Yeah, I think it's a little saying.  It's something like, if only I had as many days off as my neighbors think I did, if only  I got laid as much as my mother-in-law thinks I did, and if only I made as much money as  my wife thinks I did, then being a pilot would be a good job. 
[02:11:30]  Well, they say on layovers that pilots get sex 90% of the nights that they're laid over,  and 10% of that time it's with a partner.  They're fucking comedians, these guys.  It's a hotel room.  What are you going to do?  Hey, I work the legislation to allow catnaps, and I'll tell you, as passengers, here's what  you guys should wish for.  You should hope that your pilots are the most alert when they're doing that descent and 
[02:12:00]  approach to landing.  Yeah, of course.  Hey, a question of both of you.  Jimmy brought it up, and there's some suspicion that maybe these two pilots were blowing each  other.  Go.  What do you got on that?  Nah, that's...  But that's usually when one of them's a female.  I don't know that...  No, that stuff doesn't go on.  That'll hurt...  Usually the pilots just eat their young. 
[02:12:30]  They never do anything like that.  That would hurt to have the throttle in your belly as you're trying to blow the pilot.  The plane's like...  Going down.  You're still leaving on the new Airbus of handling your own joystick, I suppose.  Did we see that there were other people that thought this guy was full of shit or not?  Yeah, we lost the other guy.  Okay, no, he's not.  And then there's a bunch of people.  Matt in Indiana, I fly in an hour, you're scaring the shit out of me.  And Adam in Fort Lauderdale, so glad that I'm driving to the airport listening to this  right now. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, it's fine.  It's the safest mode of transportation.  What airline has the safest aircraft, do you think?  Well, statistically, Qantas, because they never pranked anything.  But it's all really, really the same.  The ones, personally, that I stay away from is small airliners.  Oh, yeah.  Because the big thing on those is maintenance.  I mean, pilots are pretty much all the same, say, as controllers.  I mean, they have to pass a lot of proficiency.  But you want to check who's got the healthiest bottom line, because they've got the most 
[02:13:30]  money to do preventative maintenance.  And that's what's going to get you.  There you go.  That's great.  Yeah, it usually is.  Some kind of fucking shit like that.  Foreign carriers do leave your biggest risk, because we don't regulate their maintenance  procedures.  And you guys are aware of this.  Especially coming out of places like New York and some of the West Coast airports.  You know, you can hop on some of the foreign carriers to do your overseas flights.  But, you know, the FAA, I'm sure they're aware of what those foreign carrier maintenance  procedures are.  But we're not.  We can't tell them what to do to their airplanes. 
[02:14:00]  And I'd say the U.S. aircraft maintenance procedures are some of the safest in the world.  And some of the aircraft, even though they may be old, in reality, they go in for these  massive seed checks, they call them, which is a maintenance thing, where they literally  tear that thing all the way down to just the sheet metal and the wires, recheck everything,  they replace what needs to be replaced.  So a lot of times, even though an airframe might be 15, 20 years old, inside and out,  the thing's brand new.  Right.  And, oh my God, I agree with the pilots. 
[02:14:30]  These fucking guys.  You're not going to find anything better than the U.S. maintenance procedures on the U.S.  carriers.  And nobody really is operating a really old fleet anymore.  All right.  Final shots, because we've got to take a break.  Yeah, I wish I had the new contract.  The air traffic controller just signed.  Well, that's talk about a job doing very little, but getting a whole lot of money.  Wow.  30 years is pushing 10, and I get to retire at age 51 and live one mile from a golf course  and go golfing every day. 
[02:15:00]  Ha-ha!  My retirement, after not a lot of the industry shrunk, all the management came to all the  pilot groups all over the country and said, hey, we need all your pay and all your retirement  to save the company.  So, uh, there's a whole lot of stuff out there that have any more retirement.  So, I'm telling my kids to be air traffic controllers.  Absolutely.  But when they find out their parents was a pilot, they may not pass the eligibility.  Ha-ha!  Oh, shit!  You're a prick.  Oh, man.  All right, guys. 
[02:15:30]  I gotta go.  I gotta go.  That's good.  All right, guys.  Contact approach.  Yeah.  And get the frequency right so you don't go out in the wall, blue yarn, or get lost.  Dummy.  Later.  Fucking, hey, James in Nova Scotia, if he's still listening, make sure you call the show  from time to time.  That's funny.  And, Bob, you were definitely cool, too.  You called back.  Goddamn, that was fun.  All right, listen, we're going to take a break.  Danny found some great Mermaid Girl video.  We're going to check that out.  And also, Jocktober.  Jocktober.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit, I almost forgot. 
[02:16:00]  A special Jocktober today.  Is it a very special Jocktober?  It's not us, thank God, but it's a special one.  Every year, we have to do Scott and Todd.  Today is the day.  Oh, nice.  Today is the day.  Yeah, they make Jocktober special.  We should save this for tomorrow, because we already gave these fuckers a good radio  show, but you know what?  We keep pushing and pushing.  Scott and Todd featured today for Jocktober.  Fucking rivalry.  That was great.  Between the air driver controllers and pilots.  You know something?  You always knew it was there, but you never knew to what extent they goof on each other. 
[02:16:30]  I never suspected it was there.  You didn't suspect it was there?  I assume, if you watch the movie like Pushing Tin, you ever see that one?  Billy Bob Thornton?  No.  You kind of, you see in that movie, it's not a good movie, believe me, but you see in  that movie that there is this thing between the pilots and air traffic controllers.  Why do they call it Pushing Tin?  Because that's what you're pretty much doing, is pushing fucking airplanes.  Oh, okay.  They call it Tin.  They're just pushing it around the skies, the runways, the fucking, you know.  I never heard that before.  Yeah.  That term, whatever.  Pushing Tin. 
[02:17:00]  All right.  Quick break.  We'll do Jocktober, Mermaid Girl, and other stuff.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony, tomorrow, some of the folks from Paranormal Activity, the movie that we  discussed a little earlier today.  Do you know a little trivia about that movie?  Huh?  Made for $15,000.  I don't think many people know.  Really?  And it's made over $60 million.  $60 million.  Wow.  Wait, what do you think?  What do you think?  Good investment.  Quick, what do you think?  Great. 
[02:17:30]  Huh?  Great.  I think it's, uh...  That's not what it is.  Oh.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Why?  Well, from a distance.  Yeah.  How far?  The Hubble?  And it has to be said, uh, you know, I've liked you two for many, many years.  Well, thanks, Hope.  I feel the same.  Yeah.  Uh, they sucked at SNL.  You too? 
[02:18:00]  Fucking two new songs that I could give a shit about.  And I like when they do their new stuff, uh, when a band does their new stuff on SNL.  I don't mind that.  The song sucked.  Yeah.  I don't know what fucking Bono was trying to do.  I don't know.  And you can tell the...  I don't know!  It was the first album I bought, listened to once, and haven't put it in my, uh, my CD  player since.  Didn't like it.  I don't know what it is.  I just can't get into the new U2, and I think they played...  It must be two songs off the new album, and I don't know.  The band looked like they were just going through the motions, too. 
[02:18:30]  Like, uh, this is Bono's thing.  Maybe they know, like, yeah, the album is like, meh, meh, meh.  But they've done that before, where they put out albums, and it's like, what the fuck  are they doing?  And then they come back.  Come back strong.  Well, they've been on a nice roll, so it was about time, I guess.  For the most part, they've had, uh, just huge success with their albums.  There's only two or three that were a complete bust.  Do we have any audio from this?  Uh, from SNL?  Yeah, from the, from, or from the song.  I don't know what songs they are.  I mean, yeah, if you want to go down that road, uh, they could get it down the hall. 
[02:19:00]  I'd love to hear some of the most overrated band ever.  Oh, I love you, too.  I know.  Some of the stuff is all right, man.  I wish I, I don't hate them.  I just think they're very overrated, but...  Do you really?  Completely.  Do you know how many bands have come and gone since U2 started?  I think a lot.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit, the devil.  Jesus.  That scared me.  And then I, I think they did a YouTube concert last night.  Uh, U2 doing a YouTube concert.  Yes.  But it started way too fucking late.  I think it started at 8.30 Pacific time, right?  Yeah, buddy. 
[02:19:30]  Didn't it start at like 11.30 at night or something?  Baseball game to watch.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  That's probably the start of late.  Uh, Mermaid Girl.  Dead.  She made it to 10 years old and she died.  She was the one that had her legs.  She was born with them like fused together or something.  And we thought, and you said that they separated her legs.  They did not.  All right, then it's a different Mermaid Girl.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm starting to think it might be a different Mermaid Girl too.  Different Mermaid Girl.  Because the one that we talked about, that was only a year or two ago, right? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, and they separated her legs.  And that was like kind of a newborn.  This is, this girl made it to 10 years old.  How is she fat?  They said in this case, if they separated her legs, she would have bled to death.  Yeah.  How is she fat?  The food can't leave her body.  Oh, my God.  Does she have a hanging hole?  I don't know what she's got.  Or a bag.  I don't know, but.  We're standing in Bella.  Yep.  I'm in Bella.  That big fat head.  She's in the ring.  This is the Little Mermaid video on YouTube.  She's on a merry-go-round. 
[02:20:30]  At an amusement park.  Cute, chubby girl.  In the history of the world, we've been able to find somewhere between four and eight children  that have been able to be described as surviving with this condition.  Wait, how many?  Four to eight?  Oh, my God.  How do they cover?  Her legs were fused from her waist down.  She had no rectum, no genitalia, no uterus, no bladder, only six inches of large blood. 
[02:21:00]  I wish we had no bladder.  I'm kidding, Steve.  Why is my daughter here?  Why has she survived?  Somebody forgot to tell her that she was supposed to die.  I get it.  No rectum, no...  Jesus.  Well, how'd they get the food out?  Maybe Hopey's right.  That's why she's fat.  She can't shit.  Mom, what happened to me?  What's the next best step for her?  Possibly just requiring an amputation and just taking it off altogether. 
[02:21:30]  I'm scared.  I'm scared of her, Mom.  I want somebody telling me what to do.  What's the right thing to do for her?  I'm a mermaid.  Some people are the same.  Some people are different.  Some people are short.  Some people are tall.  Look, I'm not even quite the same than all the others, but some people just like the way I am.  There's no God, by the way.  There is no God.  She's a cute little chubby kid.  You know what?  I'm fucking changing.  That fucking depressed the shit out of me. 
[02:22:00]  She's cute.  I'd be all rah-rah, let's make fun of the little fucker.  Ah, fucker in the ass.  Oh.  Jesus, man.  She doesn't have an ass.  I'm actually ashamed of you.  I know.  I'll leave today feeling horrible about myself like I do every day.  What did she die of?  Jesus Christ.  Her fucking organs.  It's a childish question, but what did they do for her to go to the bathroom? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, what did they do?  It must have been a bag.  They had a colostomy, a bagger.  Maybe Dr. Steve could explain, because how does the poopy come out?  That's all we want to know.  It's got to be liquid, or it's got to be a bag?  Where?  And then she had no...  Yeah, we saw her swimming.  Where the fuck was the bag?  Well, she probably takes it out when she swims.  No, I know that, but there's no marks.  They put her in the water.  It looks like a scared octopus.  Oh, my God.  You ever see they spray ink?  Look, all I'm saying is they probably colostomy bagged her, and then the fact that she has 
[02:23:00]  no bladder, though, is weird.  Like, I guess every...  It's all just poison.  They got every...  Where the waste comes out, must have funneled it into a bag.  She does not look like Ariel.  No.  I must say.  There's no Ariel there.  Oh, no.  She's got a little personality, though.  Little chubby girl.  Yeah, yeah, you know, kind of against all odds, coming back, speaking her peace.  What'd she die of, though? 
[02:23:30]  That stinks.  Died of one leg-itis.  That's what she has.  Look at it.  And then the end of her mermaid things kind of curl.  She had a little curly turnip feet.  Where do you buy pajamas for that?  I guess you got to make all her clothes.  Yeah, they don't make them.  There's only been four to eight in the entire history.  Yeah, that would be a bad business idea.  If that are they just...  Ted's a mermaid clothing emporium!  I have jean!  Jean!  Would you like to buy a pair of pants? 
[02:24:00]  They just cut one leg off of Steve's pants.  Give it to the little child.  Oh, that would be the spermaid!  Get it?  Because he's a homosexual.  Ted, you don't get a lot of business, though.  For your mermaid clothes.  I certainly don't!  I have two back orders, which I'm working on diligently.  One will be canceled.  Why?  Why cancel it?  You need all the business you can get.  You're not catching that one, are you, Gregory?  No. 
[02:24:30]  See?  You lost the customer.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah, there's not many in the world.  Damn.  But, you know, lived a full life.  They're beating me up, man, because they're saying that 10 is a full life.  It's terrible.  They're beating me up because they said that the U2SNL thing was a repeat.  But was it?  But it was new to me.  Yeah, see?  It was fucking new to me.  It was new to you.  It was new to me.  I had pneumonia.  Wow, really?  She got a little cold, and then they got into pneumonia. 
[02:25:00]  She went to the hospital, ventilator.  And antibiotics.  Jesus Christ.  I guess God needed a disfigured freak show.  Jesus, Danny.  Thanks, Danny.  Oh, the world's largest pickled punk.  I guess God needed a new fish for his fish tank.  Yeah.  She's okay now.  Yeah, and in heaven she's got two legs and she's running around.  Yeah.  Swimming and stuff and shitting normally. 
[02:25:30]  Exactly.  She's got a little bung in heaven.  It's really low.  When it's low like that, is it normal out there?  I'm not sure they work all day.  I'll bring the sun to slave away.  While we be boating full time and floating under the sea.  I cannot pee.  I cannot pee.  Don't you talk to fish is happy as I'm still doing. 
[02:26:00]  And my bag is crappy.  We got one from Paul in Pittsburgh.  Paul, go.  Hey, she's right.  People are different.  Some people are tall.  Some people are short.  Some people got no coolie hole.  Oh.  I babysat her.  I didn't know what to do.  Oh.  Uncle Paul.  I said, wait a minute.  Where's this and that?  Julia? 
[02:26:30]  Julissa.  Oh.  How about you just call yourself Julia?  Maybe Julissa.  That's great.  Julissa?  Is that what people call you?  It's all the same.  It's really Lisa.  That's not her name.  Oh, very good, yeah.  She had a colostomy bag.  And the funny part, or the interesting part, her mother knew that she was going to be born that way.  And she blamed herself for actually having her.  And the reason why she was fat was because they had to do some sort of dialysis or something. 
[02:27:00]  They needed to tighten her up.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  So the mother knew that she was going to be born that way.  She chose to have her that way.  And then she actually blamed herself for everything that she went through.  And it's a pretty, pretty bad story.  And she had a colostomy bag.  And to swim, they made her a wetsuit, like, so she can have all this stuff and obviously not infect the pool.  Oh, so she didn't leak out all over the pool, right?  What an awful life.  That just sucks.  That's a rough one. 
[02:27:30]  That is pretty terrible.  That's a rough life, man.  That is a rough one.  A little kid.  I complain because my cock is too big and delicious.  It does no way of my pants.  The only way that's justified is if there is reincarnation in her previous life that was, like, you know, Hitler or something.  Yeah, she was a 50s dancer named Legs McGillicuddy, and she was really mean to everyone.  Legs McGillicuddy.  Like, there was another dancer, and she spelled it L-E-G-Z, and there was another dancer, fucking, like, you know, Bonnie Gams, and fucking Legs McGillicuddy hired her mafia boyfriend to break Bonnie Gams' legs with a fucking hacksaw. 
[02:28:00]  Sure.  I should get the pot in that show.  That's right.  Not her.  Don't worry, Legs.  Oh, wait a minute.  Who are you?  Yes.  Your legs, yes.  Legs McGillicuddy.  Legs McGillicuddy's my girl.  Don't worry, Legs.  I'll take care of her.  You'll do that.  And then she had Bonnie Gams' knees beaten and a hacksaw cut her legs up.  I want Bonnie Gams taken care of. 
[02:28:30]  Don't worry.  Don't worry, sweetheart.  I'm on it.  She got to meet Oprah.  Come on.  Oh, look at that.  Mermaid and a whale.  Mermaid and a whale meet Oprah.  Nothing on that one.  That's good.  Thank you.  How bad is her life if she's sitting there with Oprah, though?  Come on.  Let me see.  It's not Oprah Winfrey.  Wow.  How bad is her life because she's sitting there with Oprah?  Horrendous.  That's why she's sitting with Oprah.  Your life is never good if you're sitting with Oprah unless you're Will Smith.  Oh, God. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  I normally don't like fat kids at all to the point where I hit them in public, but I actually  think she was very cute.  Very chubby little face.  You ready for the showstopper from Pat from Wynaki?  Oh, boy.  Pat writes...  Oh, it's like Pat.  Pat writes, did they flush her down the toilet?  Oh, because that's what you do with angelfish.  And goldfish and fucking...  Oh, that's terrible.  Humor is fucking harsh. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Dr. Steve, how are you, buddy?  Hello, boys.  What do you got, a mermaid girl?  Well, you know, this is a thing called Serena Melia.  It's...  I knew her.  It's about as common as conjoined twins are, and it's, you know, kind of the same sort  of deal, except the legs are fused together.  How often do they see this?  They're saying like one in ten people born?  No, it's like one in a hundred thousand.  One in ten! 
[02:30:00]  Boy, they'd be all over the place.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Right.  Anyway, and this girl apparently didn't have a bladder.  Or any female organ.  I think she had one ovary and a quarter of a kidney.  So she had a kidney transplant, and that's how she got to live for as long as she did.  Wow.  How did she get a kidney?  Yeah, really.  Well, you kind of go...  Who was asleep at the wheel that day? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  The guy giving out kidneys.  She lived until two years old before she had the kidney, so she was on the list for a  couple years.  Don't you think...  I thought those kidneys were very, you know, very rare, though.  Well, they are.  So why are you giving it to a mermaid girl when maybe there's a little fucker that has two  legs that wants to be a baseball star someday?  She probably got the ones from the guy in the hotel room that woke up in the ice, the  tub full of ice, with a note that said, get to the hospital.  Yes, of course.  That happens all the time.  She got it from the black market. 
[02:31:00]  Wow.  So how does...  Now, obviously, she had a colostomy bag or something?  She must have.  She had...  She only had six inches of large colon, and honestly...  Ow.  I did a PubMed search, just, you know, of the medical literature to see if I could find  where...  If they had described her surgery, and I can't find how that part worked.  She may have had a cloaca, which is actually where the colon and the... 
[02:31:30]  And, you know, that's what birds have, is, you know, they urine and defecate out the  same orifice, and she may have had something like that.  A cloaca.  A cloaca.  Oh, wow.  Sounds nice.  Sounds like a girl's name in the ghetto.  Yo, cloaca's gonna smack you in the face.  Cloaca, you bitch.  So, Steve...  Six inches of colon.  Imagine being able to bottom out when you're fucking someone in the ass.  Ooh.  How much...  How much should you have?  How much should you have? 
[02:32:00]  Well, when you're born, about a foot, I guess, and then you end up having about three feet  of colon when it's all done, you know, by the time you're an adult.  And there was just no way they could have stopped the bleeding if they cut her legs in it.  I guess that was just a big, fatty...  Did she have knees, or was it just a big, fatty pouch of skin?  I see bones in the x-rays.  Yeah, she had bones.  It's just the skin was fused together.  But she may have shared arteries.  You know, shared the large arteries in the legs so that they just couldn't separate them. 
[02:32:30]  You know, she would just end up with one.  And if they were sharing an artery, she would just end up with one, so you might as well  not put her through the surgery itself.  Oh, God.  Her pelvis looks all fucked up, too.  What a nightmare.  Oh, man.  Her little legs.  But they're surrounded just by her skin.  By a big, fat leg.  It's one big, fat leg.  Wow.  Yeah, and she actually had two kidney transplants.  She had one at age two, and then another one in 2007, which they say was successful. 
[02:33:00]  They don't grow on trees, those things.  Was she a good swimmer, at least?  I wouldn't think so.  I wouldn't think so.  With that big, fat, fucking leg, and there's no fin on the back.  Yeah.  It's a little thing.  It looks like Daryl Hannah in Splash.  Her feet were really fucked up.  The bones in her feet were really messed up.  Yeah.  Hey, Dr. Steve, do you believe in God?  Yeah, actually, I do.  So why did he make Mermaid Girl?  I don't know. 
[02:33:30]  I see.  I'll believe it, but I don't have any clue.  That would be one of those, you know, if there's a question and answer period, then  that will be one of my first questions.  What did she do to deserve a life like that?  Yeah, I don't like McGillicuddy.  She probably fell under the random, whereas God allows certain things, then allows the random  to happen, which means whatever the chips fall, they fall.  Well, God doesn't give you anything that you can't handle.  Like feet?  Really?  Feet. 
[02:34:00]  God damn.  Well, I'll see you boys in 10 days.  Yes.  And Steve, your thing I'll try to help you with, but you might want to ask Steve, because  he might be better equipped.  I am, because it's Saturday, you're doing a Saturday show.  Do you know sex?  Yeah, thank you, Jim.  I'm working on that.  Okay.  I only think I forgot.  Jim's talking about a special guest that we're going to have on Weird Medicine on the  Saturday Night Virus, 9 to midnight, Saturday, November 7th.  Are we going to do a big bit with you, too? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, I'm working on it.  As long as the lawyers will let us go with it, I think it'll make O&A history.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Damn.  It's a tough order.  They should allow you to do it.  Well, we'll talk about that.  Yeah, fair.  Steve's got a good idea.  Steve wants to blow homeless people.  I'll just stand there, and we'll make fun of Steve Blatter's last name and some other  guy named Bedwetter.  I can't remember his name.  Steve Blatter will just stand there awkwardly looking like fucking Jughead from the Archie  comics in a suit. 
[02:35:00]  Hey, that's Big Ethel.  Boo.  Well, I got all kinds of Blatter jokes just in case the bit doesn't happen.  We should make Steve Blatter walk around with a fucking Jughead hat.  It's fucking Blatter.  Oh, my God.  You are the worst.  You just killed him.  You just killed Blatter.  Oh, did you just slam in?  Blatter's Jughead.  That's him.  Oh, my God.  That's so wrong.  That's classic.  Every time he walks in, we should play the Archie's theme music and fucking pelt him 
[02:35:30]  with heated tomatoes.  Why do they have to be heated?  Because they hurt when they burst on you.  Okay.  Like little cum bubbles.  Got an answer for everything.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  All right, boy.  We'll see you in 10 days.  That's great.  All right.  The big Dr. Steve visit is upon us finally.  Holy shit.  He's been talking about it for over a year.  That is fucking...  That's the Blatter.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  He's not going to be happy with that one.  No, he's not.  I want him to wear that fucking silver crown hat.  That dumb hat that Jughead wore.  Yep.  I remember Big Ethel wanted to just get a couple of fingers knuckle deep in Jughead's rump. 
[02:36:00]  And he was not having it.  Because he was queer for Archie and his fucking smelly red balls.  He loved Archie's balls.  And Archie always wanted to fuck Betty and Veronica.  But he knew that Betty was more of a goer.  Yeah, yeah.  Betty was more of a whore.  Veronica wouldn't take it in the mouth.  He wouldn't let him fuck in the ass.  Mr. Lodge would always come in.  Veronica was the mean one, right?  Yeah.  With the black hair?  And Mr. Lodge was always the rich... 
[02:36:30]  She was the rich one.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  They both had black hair.  No, no.  One was blonde, right?  Wasn't Betty blonde and Veronica had the black hair?  Yeah, I think you're right.  Yeah.  Mr. Lodge.  Yeah.  Mr. Lodge.  Yeah, yeah.  See?  One black hair.  One blonde hair.  Yeah, that's updated, though.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, that's...  Get the old ones, Danny.  That's Betty and Veronica, the spinoff.  I want Betty and Veronica from the 50s.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah, there you go.  They're both lounging around with camel toe, sitting on these, like, chaise lounges. 
[02:37:00]  And Betty said, this is wonderful.  What more can we ask for?  And Veronica says, I can think of a few things.  Oh.  And behind the tree, there's a bunch of boys looking.  There's one, two, three, four, five guys, and one black gentleman.  Yeah.  He's a guy, too.  No, I mean, just, you know.  Oh, look, Lil' Archie and Lil' Jinx were also mentioned.  Who's Lil' Jinx?  I don't know.  I was never into fucking Archie. 
[02:37:30]  Who is?  I was.  Were you really?  I used to love the Archies.  For real?  Only the comic.  Not the show is for fucking Moe's.  But I like the fucking...  I love the comics.  Oh, yeah.  That Archie one.  Yeah, I used to...  Here you go.  It's Reggie, Veronica, Arch, and Betty walking.  And Reggie says, Archie...  They're looking at a picture of the fucking space shuttle taking off.  And he goes, Archie, have you ever been so uptight you'd want to go into outer space?  And Archie goes, only in exam time! 
[02:38:00]  Whoa.  That's crazy.  Wow, see?  Well, I guess he's not ready for his exams.  No, no.  That's why I'd rather be in outer space.  What's Archie Comics number one look like?  He's probably going to Archie throwing a black man out of an establishment in the 50s.  Archie the racist taking his clan hood off.  Is that it right there?  Yeah.  Number one.  Wow, he was all buck-toothed and Howdy Doody-ish.  Yeah.  He's doing barrel jumping.  It's called The Mirth of a Nation, it says. 
[02:38:30]  Isn't Archie a wonderful skater?  Betty says, and Veronica says, yes, but he can't swim.  And Jughead is sitting spread-legged.  And the barrels, he's riding two barrels, are heading towards a hole in the ice.  See, he just jumped over the barrels, and now he's going to fall into the water.  And that's going to be the problem.  In the ice water.  And then Archie's going to die in the comic number one because he freezes to death.  Jughead looks like his cock is hard the way the fucking pants are.  Yeah, look, they've got a big pant bubble there. 
[02:39:00]  He's got the Kenny thing.  What did Kenny call his little puff when we were at breakfast?  Can you see how much that was worth?  The fuck was it again?  How much is that worth?  I'm going to guess $10,000.  $10,000 for the first Archie?  Yeah, I don't know.  For Archie?  The Archies are never...  The Archies had so many spin-off comics.  There was Archie, there was Betty and Veronica, there was like Jughead.  There was a whole shitload of spin-offs.  Jesus, you really know this shit.  I was a kid, I used to collect comic books.  Comic books.  I sold them to drink.  Really?  Yeah.  Today, number one. 
[02:39:30]  I had a couple good ones.  X-Men 94.  How much is it worth?  The first Archies.  Five.  I'm going to take a break and get into the...  Five Gs?  I'm guessing between five and ten.  I thought there was an answer there.  No?  No answer.  My mistake.  We'll find the answer.  Why don't we take a break again?  We're going to do Jack Tolbert, the return of Scott and Todd.  This is a must-listen.  Oh, yeah.  And Jim, are you promoting anything?  Holy shit.  Oh, you got the answer?  38 grand.  Nice. 
[02:40:00]  $837.  I don't know what kind of condition it was in.  It's 7.0.  Very fine.  Fine to very fine.  Jim in 10.  Wow.  How mad would you be if you bought a comic of that worth, and you opened it, and you  found a relatively fresh human shit smeared in the middle of it?  How would that ever happen?  Relatively.  Meaning it had been done in like the last two weeks.  The comic survived 60 years, and then someone just got mad and took a big shit and then 
[02:40:30]  closed the book over it.  So it was like mushed halfway through.  That's awful.  You know how fucking hot under the collar you'd be?  Oh, would you be pissed?  Demand your money back?  Boy, I'm not going to say what it is, but can I say I love some of the ideas floating  around in the emails lately?  Oh, right.  A couple of good ones, man.  Yes.  Why is everyone yelling teacher cock?  What do we mean?  Actually, they called the bump that Kenny had in his pants. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, thank you.  Bob Kelly called it.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, Bob Kelly called that.  Yeah, a bunch of guys come.  All right, yeah, thank you.  We got the answer to that.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Jack Tober with Scott and Todd after the break.  Stay there.  Got a second to Jack Tober.  Jack Tober.  We only have a few more days, huh, of the Jack Tober thing?  It's going so fast, isn't it?  This year it played out very well.  Yeah.  Sam did a very good job with Jack Tober.  Let's play the official sweeper and get right into it. 
[02:41:30]  Happy Jack Tober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony's Show.  I want to rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of ours.  I'm wearing panties to this party.  I've never seen a better antonym of hysterical.  Crank up the crapola, it's Jack Tober on the O.P. and Anthony's Show.  It was the yang for the yin.  Yes.  It was the polar opposite.  Happy Jack Tober, everybody, from your friends at the O.P. and Anthony's Show. 
[02:42:00]  Nice.  Very nice.  And today, it's Scott and Todd.  Every year we have to do at least one Scott and Todd.  Yeah, we didn't have to go far.  It's New York's own WPLJ's Big Show with Scott and Todd.  Big Show.  It's the Big Show.  These guys suck.  You don't like them?  Oh, never liked them.  Why, Scott and Rocky Dennis?  I like them a lot. 
[02:42:30]  That blockhead.  Oh, you blockhead.  He really is a fucking lunkhead.  Yeah.  We start with their Yankee song.  Oh, right.  A little refresher for everyone.  You know what's good?  I'm kind of just pausing.  I'm pausing because I don't want to do this today because I hate these guys.  I hate them. 
[02:43:00]  Well, you know what?  You loved the other shows?  Well, no.  These guys especially I hate because they're just taking up space.  In the number one radio market.  They've been here longer than anyone else in New York.  Yeah, they are officially the longest running morning show, I guess.  And they're just horrendous.  I don't know who likes this shit.  They're very popular.  And maybe.  With who?  Well, it's not young people or men.  I don't know.  A lot of women who like.  Maybe older women. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that's a coveted demo.  Maybe doctor's waiting rooms.  Well, we're going to replay this because Jimmy wasn't here.  We did all sports songs on Fridays.  I love sports songs.  As part of Jocktober and Scott and Todd's song was just horrendous.  Todd's a Yankee song.  Oh, cool.  So we're going to play this for you, Jimmy, especially.  And then we're going to get into a basic day of radio with Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  Want some belly button, Sam?  No, thank you.  I appreciate the offer.  Shut up. 
[02:44:00]  That ball is high.  And it's strong.  And it's good.  He's done it again.  It's time to finish what they started.  Whishers to the plate.  Yankees strike first.  Gonna leave the Angels brokenhearted.  A 12-pitch seventh inning for Sabathia.  Man, the Bronx was rocking.  It was wicked loud.  We're going to take you to the series for the hometown crowd. 
[02:44:30]  It's all night in mid-October.  We won't be happy till it's over.  And we have another flag to fly.  The rainbow-colored one, you fool.  Let's go, Yanks.  Oh, my God.  I don't understand.  Let's go, Yank.  All right.  They should be singing that while looking through a window at a cracker. 
[02:45:00]  Was that Scott and Todd?  Yes.  It's Todd.  That's Todd singing.  Todd is the magic man when it comes to song parodies.  Todd Pettengale.  Yeah.  All he needs is a pen, paper, and a giant shoehorn.  I thought you guys were Yankees fans.  Yeah.  You should be cranking this.  You are Yankees fans.  Yeah.  Fans.  You are Yankees fans.  Fans.  I hate that guy who fucking walks for the Bory Show.  Why?  The big guy.  Why?  He walks tough.  Oh, wow.  Is this like when teens go wild, he yells at them? 
[02:45:30]  Special Ops.  Yeah, he's Special Ops.  He's got to like...  Give me that.  He's got to like scare them.  Put them in boot camp.  I would love when these guys would knock him the fuck out.  No kidding.  What Danny was pointing out was on the TV above, that's faux Onassis who sang the other Yankees  song.  Oh, really?  They're playing.  They're doing the Yankees song.  The Free FM song.  Is he doing one now?  Yeah.  Oh, you missed a great one on Friday.  He's doing all the Yankees songs.  Yeah.  For 92.3 now.  Because it's a big song.  Very popular.  Put it up. 
[02:46:00]  You might have it on me right now.  It's the...  Now the TV pot.  Over here.  Yankees, Yankees, the best show across the globe.  Oh, my Yankee fans.  This is it.  2009, baby.  We'll see.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Bo, Anassis and Mina.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  I love that song.  And they said, Good Day, New York, the best in the globe?  In the globe.  In the globe.  Around the globe.  That means unstoppable. 
[02:46:30]  Well, let's do it.  I got Mina's lines down.  The Yankees.  The Yankees.  And then you're like, and Gina, I'm just a little...  But I want to hear a couple more things.  I'll still do a copy of the lyrics.  Thank you very much.  Thanks so much, guys.  Thank you for having us here.  Appreciate it.  Oh, jeez.  All right.  Coming up on Good Day, New York, we got Wendy Warm Up.  That's right.  Wow.  That's awesome.  Wendy Warm Up.  What a terrible show that is.  I told you his name was Pho-O-Nassis.  Yeah, you're right, sir.  Pho-O-Nassis.  Let's get back to the Todd song, though. 
[02:47:00]  Please.  That's...  A-Rod staring at the baseball.  And Gina's going into the hole.  But first, the Yankees have to win it all.  Let's go, Yankees.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Gonna beat the team named after heaven. 
[02:47:30]  That one got to Jimmy bad.  And Jimmy was trying to make...  The angels.  Angels.  Because they're named after heaven.  Named after heaven.  They're called the Los Angeles non-existence.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  That one hurt, huh, Jimmy?  Fucking...  That one hurt.  Where could this be?  Hold on.  The game is not even gonna go seven.  Oh.  Maybe.  I don't remember.  Something...  Wait, hold on.  What else?  Something with 11. 
[02:48:00]  You know?  I don't remember.  Probably seven.  We played this Friday and I don't even remember.  This is the best of seven.  I bet.  Gonna beat the team named after heaven.  Just another ho-ho-minning for Sabathia.  On their way to lucky 27.  That's it in the air right.  Jeter makes it 2-0.  Time to get this ALCS done.  They got a magic number and it's down to one. 
[02:48:30]  It's all night in mid-October.  We won't be happy till it's over.  And we have another flag to fly.  Let's go, Yanks.  Man, we're all behind Girardi.  We wanna start the freakin' party.  One more win and then we take the show. 
[02:49:00]  Yanks, let's go.  It should have said, we're all behind Girardi.  Steinbrenner's a part of Lemon Party.  That is...  What's the original song that's from?  It's Bon Jovi.  Oh, I like the song.  Well, you know he's gonna have to rework it now that they're in the World Series.  Yeah, I was listening today to see if there was a new one, but there's not a new one yet. 
[02:49:30]  So they played this one?  Yes.  Oh my God.  This one's dated.  They've been playing that since, like, last year.  I'd rather listen to Liza Minnelli than that song.  Wow.  I really don't wanna listen to Liza Minnelli.  Let's say hi to Brent in Ohio.  Brent?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hi, Brent.  Oh, this is the biggest pile of shit I've ever heard.  It's not good.  That was really bad.  Timmy was, like, trying to, like, get us all into it.  Like, he's, like, snapping his fingers, and then he finally had to give up. 
[02:50:00]  That's terrible.  Yeah.  Fucking horrible.  I got the fucking deuce chills.  I just wanna jack my car into a fucking telephone pole and end it all before I have to hear any fucking more.  That was bad.  Holy shit.  We'll play the team named After Heaven.  Oh, my...  Ah, thank you.  Let's go to Gooch.  Gooch.  I just...  He kind of stole my thunder a little bit.  I have the deuce chills so bad, my spine cracked.  Oh, no.  That's chilling.  You know how you scrunch up your shoulders and, like, try to warm your neck?  Next thing you know, you need a fucking chiropractor. 
[02:50:30]  What the fuck?  Fucking...  It's that tone that...  La, la, la, la, la, la.  It's just awful.  Let's...  Go...  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, who laughs at that?  But I don't understand.  Who gets pumped?  How do they survive in radio?  They must have made $40 a week.  I just want to hear you going...  Just giving them one of those laughs.  Yuck.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to do that.  A little obnoxious.  The worst.  All right.  Now we get into some of their show. 
[02:51:00]  Nice.  Now he has the meat and potatoes.  What I like about Joctober, it's very easy to just pick any show and make it sound horrendous.  What Sam does is just pick a regular show and grab a few bits.  Yes.  So this is all from one show this morning, matter of fact, I think, right?  It's a...  Well, part of it is from Friday.  Part of it is from this morning.  Okay.  But it's not like, you know, it's not a pick and grab situation.  It's this is what was on.  There's a couple of talk breaks, a couple of bits.  So I have a couple of talk breaks and a couple bits.  First one, Scott, Todd, and Patty. 
[02:51:30]  Patty's...  She...  Is that the Patty we know?  It's not Stalker Patty.  Oh.  Cakes?  Is it...  I mean...  Because another...  Because another battle, I don't fight anymore.  Oh, let's see here.  Where is it?  Cakes.  Oh, right, right.  Is it that one?  Because that's another battle, I don't fight anymore.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, then if we don't know, everything's fine.  Yeah.  If she sucks, she sucks. 
[02:52:00]  I'm just not going to say half the shit I did last time.  I mean, Patty's been with their show for a little while.  All right.  Scott, Todd, and Patty talk about being the longest running morning show in New York.  That's good.  They are devoid of humor.  That's what Sam writes here.  Devoid?  They don't have any.  You got 95.5 PLJ.  This is the Scott and Todd radio show.  New York's longest running continuous morning show.  They're still trying to figure out whether that sounds good or something. 
[02:52:30]  Another guy that's got mouth problems.  He's talking over his dentures.  He's number one, the longest running show in New York history.  Is he talking over dentures?  He's talking over his dentures, I believe.  Trying to keep them from popping out of his mouth, but still doing the radio voice.  Super Rake is sponsored by Effort Dent.  How important is opening your mouth when you're doing radio?  You got to kind of keep your choppers in your mouth.  You think he's talking over dentures? 
[02:53:00]  It sounds like he's talking over dentures.  Talking over dentures.  Talking over dentures.  I love that bit.  The talking over dentures bit.  Dan in Tennessee.  Dan.  Hey.  Hey.  Dan.  That's horrendous.  You know, it just pisses me off as a former dish jockey myself.  The fact that there are talented dish jockeys out there like me having to deliver fucking pizza.  And this crap passes for entertainment.  Yeah.  And they're in the number one market.  Thank God. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  They're in the number one market.  I don't.  I never got it.  I mean, Scott Shannon did some unique stuff for the business, but I don't know.  He's been calling in for a long fucking time now.  Is that the same Scott Shannon that's on that syndicated true oldies jail?  Hi.  I'm Scott Shannon.  Makes me want to fucking pull over and puke.  Can we hear his dentures voice again?  Yeah.  Thank you, Dan.  I want to hear that.  Yeah.  Let's go back to that.  You got 95.5 PLJ.  This is the Scott and Todd radio show. 
[02:54:00]  New York's longest running continuous morning show.  We're still trying to figure out whether that sounds good or sounds bad.  I think it's good.  Is that all right?  Sure.  Yeah.  Why would it be bad?  Well, it just makes it sound like we've been around forever.  He's saying it's cool.  Well, it just makes it sound like we've been around forever.  He can't say S. An S will make it pop right out of his fucking mouth.  It makes it sound like we've been around forever.  It's using the side teeth.  Your side teeth before your molars and not your front teeth to try to make your S's. 
[02:54:30]  But he says it makes it sound like we've been around forever.  No, you're making it sound like that, how you talk, because you have been.  You hear how old he sounds again?  That sounds like a piece of the movie, The Oldest Man Alive.  The movie's called The Oldest Man Alive, and here he speaks.  Larry King checking in, Ann.  Thank God.  Larry, what do you got today?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How important is the polygrip? 
[02:55:00]  But how important is actually doing the Larry King voice?  Fucking idiot.  How important is S in the English language?  How hard is it to do it?  We got another Larry.  Larry King, what's up?  Scott and Todd, how important are the teeth when pronouncing the T-H sound?  Oh.  Larry King checking in, Ann.  Larry. 
[02:55:30]  Hello.  Yeah.  Larry.  How important is the lisp?  Is there a little lisp in there, too?  Well, I know it's just the way he's talking like this, over his dentures.  Just trying to keep all the teeth in there?  Trying to keep them in there.  I don't know how good that is.  Does he sound old or not?  Minuous morning show.  We're still trying to figure out whether that sounds good or sounds bad.  Oh, I think it's good.  Is that all right?  Sure, yeah.  Why would it be bad?  Well, it just makes it sound like we've been around forever.  You saying it's bad makes it sound bad. 
[02:56:00]  No, I think it's okay, though.  And plus, you said it.  No one else said it.  Yeah.  You know, I'm pretty proud of it, to be honest with you.  There you go.  You know, you don't find a lot of groups of people stay together for very long periods  of time.  No.  Now that I think about it, it's a pretty good thing.  Most marriages don't last that long.  Nope.  Better than some of those guys that got to sit home thinking, I wish I had a job.  You know, there's a lot of people who do this.  You know, they hate their jobs while they have them.  Yep.  And when they don't have them, they realize how good their job was when they had it. 
[02:56:30]  Yep.  They go like this, man, it doesn't seem so bad after all, man.  Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut.  Yes, you should.  You should.  Or you should have kept it open when you talked.  Jesus fucking teeth McGillicuddy is not doing a good job.  It's kind of uncomfortable, isn't it?  It's horrendous.  So uncomfortable.  And devoid of humor.  Right.  There wasn't any jokes or anything.  It makes it sound like we've been here forever.  I don't know what I'm saying.  And then he just trails off. 
[02:57:00]  It sounds like he has dentures and he's doddering.  Yeah, doddering.  Yeah, you know, we got to write it over.  He's doddering.  It's like he loses interest halfway through.  He's a goldfish memory.  He sounds like Imus with a goldfish memory.  Imus in the morning.  Doddering.  Doddering.  Yeah, it just sounds like I'm talking.  He's doddering.  He's a doddering fool.  Talks through the commercials.  He doesn't know.  What is this crap?  My Toronto. 
[02:57:30]  My Toronto.  I don't know if it's good or bad.  It sounds like he has fucking like a dentist tongue.  I just want to see him phoong out of his mouth.  Is it good or bad?  I don't know.  Phoong.  You just hear them.  You hear them just like bounce off something.  He's just knocked on the table.  Chattering.  Like fucking wind up monkey teeth. 
[02:58:00]  I know.  With like fucking.  You ever eat like a roll and you look and you got that white roll gunk stuck in between  your teeth?  Do you have roll gunk in them?  Well, maybe it was just that break.  Maybe he was just warming up.  It was early.  Yeah.  Maybe.  We'll find out here.  Patty does a gossip story about Rob Blagojevich and Donald Trump.  How many people try to make a hair joke?  We have to play that game?  Yeah.  Take a wild guess because I mean it's only the most creative of creative minds would think 
[02:58:30]  Rob Blagojevich and Donald Trump together.  I got to make a hair joke.  So there's.  Oh, wow.  No one ever does that.  No, but there's Scott, Todd and Patty.  I guess three.  You can guess all three.  Is it three hair jokes?  Well, Jim is guessing all three.  I want three hair jokes.  Actually, no, I'm going to guess six.  He's tried two.  There's only one.  Well, this is part of the fun of Jocktober. 
[02:59:00]  It's going to be Scott.  The people at home are on the edge of their seat.  Scott Shannon is stupid enough to still try to do some kind of hair joke that no one's  heard before.  That's what you think?  You're going with one?  It's so obvious.  One of them will make a hair joke.  One of them will make a hair joke.  How many make a hair joke?  One?  Don't tell them.  It's a surprise.  It's a big surprise.  That's the contest.  I bet you one makes the joke.  I bet you one makes an observation.  Like, jeez, all that hair.  That's a lot of hair.  And then one guy goes, yeah, it looks like a, and then tries to be funny.  But one guy will just make an observation.  Too much hair for two people. 
[02:59:30]  Let's see.  I'm talking like a burn victim.  Just doing your scotch impersonation.  That buffoon and his big hairdo, former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, is finally  getting what he wants.  Reality TV time.  He's a team up with that balloon boy dad.  Even though there are worries about how his new gig could impact his federal corruption  trial, the judge says he won't block Rod from appearing on Donald Trump's Celebrity 
[03:00:00]  Apprentice.  The judge does want all the lawyers involved to do a little research into how the TV show  could impact potential jurors.  Prosecutors are less enthusiastic.  They're worried he's going to use the TV time to tell his side of the story and try  to taint the jury pool.  But we'll get a look at him.  I can't imagine those two together.  Trump and Blagojevich.  Two great hairdos.  I was going to say.  Oh my God.  It's following Jimmy's format.  Exactly what Jimmy said.  Two great hairdos.  I bet one looks like they're wearing a rock coat hat and the other one sounds like they're 
[03:00:30]  talking with marbles and novocaine in their mouth.  I sound like Ted Schickler after we shot the face.  They followed Jimmy's.  These guys are hilarious, Gregory.  This is my favorite radio program.  What do you enjoy about them, Ted?  They make me laugh.  They have a lot of funny hair jokes.  Put it back on.  You're spoiling it.  All right.  Two together.  Trump and Blagojevich.  Two great hairdos.  I was going to say.  Who's got the worst hair?  I know. 
[03:01:00]  Dueling hair.  Dueling skunkheads.  Give it to me, baby.  Cole fucking Kane.  Was that it?  What happened?  And then they go dueling skunkheads and then they go into laser effects.  Well, lasers make everything sound, you know, cooler and funnier and better.  Laser, give it to me, baby.  Next story.  I love the thing.  The guy goes, I was going to say, hey, what's with that hair?  You did say it.  You shouldn't have.  Yes.  He should have thought that gratefully to himself. 
[03:01:30]  Like, wow, I was going to say hair and didn't because it would have sucked and bored  everybody.  Yeah.  And the give it to me, baby.  That's like a stinger.  Like, oh, you gave it to us with that shit.  Well, in the gossip segment, between each gossip story, we get a pew, pew, pew.  Give it to me, baby.  Can we hear the hair jokes again?  You spoiled it.  You talked all through them, Gregory.  You spoiled it.  Samuel, you're ruining the fun of this program.  I don't like it a bit.  Sorry.  Where's the hair jokes? 
[03:02:00]  Scott and Todd are hilarious.  Let me try it from here.  But we'll get a look at them.  I can't imagine those two together.  Trump and Blagojevich.  Two great hair dudes.  I was going to say, who's got the worst hair?  I know.  Dueling hair.  Dueling skunkheads.  Give it to me, baby.  But if you were going to say, who's got the worst hair?  I don't know what.  That just happened.  What?  What was that?  They all got in on the fun.  What do you mean dueling hair?  What?  Dueling skunkheads. 
[03:02:30]  But he's Scott that said dueling hair.  And then Todd piped in with dueling skunkheads.  Dueling skunkheads.  Skunkheads.  Jimmy, don't look now, but.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Really?  Is this speaking of?  Huh.  Yeah.  All right.  So we're doing Jack Toro with Scott and Todd.  Why'd he look in this time? 
[03:03:00]  Good evening.  Scott doesn't look like that.  No, no.  He's got hairs.  Fucking anger.  Fucking girl.  Fuck.  For someone who's been on radio a long time, he forgot what it's all about and how to do  it, I think.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Sorry I passed you by.  I don't want to start a morning morning program on radio. 
[03:03:30]  It's the fucking worst voice ever.  Who listens to this?  Yeah, back to Scott.  When I was a kid, me and my friend David, I think his name was David Hoff or Hoffa, we  used to listen to the Shelly Sunstein joke in the morning when I was in seventh grade.  I think that was a PLJ personality, right?  Yeah, Shelly Sunstein.  I'm Shelly Sunstein, and if I left for school at the right time, I would catch the joke.  If not, I wouldn't catch it.  But me and David Hoff would actually tell each other the fucking Shelly Sunstein's PLJ joke. 
[03:04:00]  Let's get her on the phone.  She's Shelly Sunstein?  Is she still doing radio?  I'm Shelly Sunstein.  With the joke of the day?  I don't remember.  It had to be joke of the day.  Why would I tell that to my friend?  I was.  Moving on with Jacktober with Scott and Todd, the crew talks about Steve Phillips being  fired from ESPN.  Oh, this is terrible.  Oh, top it off.  We talked about Steve Phillips being fired from ESPN.  We actually predicted it.  Talked about it last week.  Do you think they'll talk about what a fat pig the girl is? 
[03:04:30]  Or how she looks retarded?  No.  She looks like a...  She's a fucking...  What a...  She looks like a bag of mumps.  Like, if you could put mumps in a clear baggie, that's what she looks like.  You wrecked your life for that?  For that?  Oh, she's...  A bag of mumps.  I like it.  Just a bag of...  A stuffed bag of mumps.  Like you force mushrooms into a baggie.  You can't even twisty-tie it at the top.  You have to hold it open because your bag is so full of mumps. 
[03:05:00]  What was he thinking?  By golly, I have to stick my dick in that bag of mumps.  No, no.  That one.  Holding the taser.  Not that bag of mumps, but the one between the Star Wars figures.  What were you thinking?  You fucking ex-Met general manager idiot.  She was putting on...  Yeah, he was the fucking general manager of the fucking Mets.  Yeah.  What a dope.  Then he had a nice gig with ESPN.  Now he's nowhere. 
[03:05:30]  Here we go.  So they talk about the Steve Phillips thing.  And this is the great part about it.  They have no angle on the story.  And the fact that the three have zero chemistry doesn't help.  Correct.  But they've been doing this for a long time.  You would think they would have chemistry by now.  Yeah.  I mean, it's like somebody will start it and then put it down.  And it will just kind of...  That's where it'll stay.  You know, just kind of stay down.  Like nobody else comes and picks it up and takes it someplace else.  Just stays down.  Who's that in the middle?  Shelley Sunstein. 
[03:06:00]  Really?  Who are those two guys standing with Dio?  She looks like Dio.  Oh, she has a face for radio.  I'm Shelley Sunstein, and this is Rainbow in the Dark.  Oh, boy.  Is that new or old?  That does look like Dio.  Maybe she has her Halloween mask on already.  It is that time of year.  Here we go.  They talk about Steve Phillips.  If you're a chick, you never want to look like Dio.  No.  No.  Oh, God. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God.  It's horrendous.  That is horrible.  Steve Phillips, no longer working for ESPN.  They sent a little press release over here earlier this morning.  Here's what it says.  His ability to be an effective representative for ESPN has been significantly damaged.  It's evident that it's time to part ways.  So, I guess they're giving him some me time to address his personal issues and his demons. 
[03:07:00]  Do you agree with that move?  He does need a little me time.  He does need to get something straightened out here.  I mean, would you say the same thing for David Letterman, then?  No.  No.  I believe that this is a little more serious offense.  When, you mean, the guy, she's actually filed a suit against him of some sort. 
[03:07:30]  I think they settled it, correct?  I think any of the women have filed suit against Letterman.  Oh, wow.  That would break on Steve Phillips?  That's what they got on Steve Phillips.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Patty is trying to get something going.  Yes.  With these two lumps.  She's trying to spark conversation.  They're giving her nothing.  Holy shit.  At least she's trying.  Well, one of the keys to good improv and conversation on the fly is one word answers, and it's no. 
[03:08:00]  Just saying, no.  That was uncomfortable.  That was terrible.  She's trying to light jellyfish on fire.  That's like how hard she's trying.  God bless her for trying.  Yeah, good luck to you.  And then she throws Letterman out there for a conversation.  Yeah.  Another happy day.  But it was subtle.  It looks like Scott Shannon doesn't have a thought in his head anymore.  It's a lot more serious.  Well, why is that, Scott?  Well, it's ESPN. 
[03:08:30]  It's more serious.  It's called the Entertainment Serious People Network.  But you're not explaining why it's more serious.  The Steve Phillips thing than the David Letterman thing.  Steve Phillips is married.  Oh, my God.  How do you do that?  How do you go with that?  So is Letterman.  Yeah, so is Letterman.  But this was somebody that he worked with. 
[03:09:00]  It was the same with Letterman.  Well, this is serious.  But why is it serious?  That's what we're trying to get from you, Tim.  Letterman tells jokes in the beginning of his show.  This guy doesn't.  At least listen to that.  This guy doesn't.  At least you're making a point.  It's serious.  Scott just likes to read his news articles.  I got to hear that again.  I need some Polly Grip.  Yeah, what does he put?  What does he hold his fucking...  If those are false, what is he holding them in with?  Polly want a grip. 
[03:09:30]  Polly want a grip.  He does need a little me time.  He does need to get something straightened out here.  Let's see if he says anything.  I mean, would you say the same thing for David Letterman, then?  No.  Oh.  I believe that this is a little more serious offense.  When, I mean, the guy, she's actually filed a suit against him of some sort.  I think they settled it, correct? 
[03:10:00]  I don't think any of the women have filed suit against Letterman.  She just goes, oh, crap.  Thanks.  Thanks for nothing.  Wow.  Faceless.  A lot more sure.  Sure.  Yeah, faceless.  I can't hold my face so far.  I can't do the voice anymore.  I lost it.  God damn.  Longest running morning show in New York City, right?  Right there. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, but see, now people will be able to go to the water cooler at work and say, hey,  did you hear Scott and Todd were talking about this guy on ESPN?  He'd get fired.  Fucking bullshit, man.  I'd fucking show them the door so fast.  Give a young show a chance.  Well, don't forget the song parody that we heard at the beginning.  Like I said.  Okay.  Beat it stupid, stupid, and stupid.  I would, I would, uh...  I wonder what their ratings are.  They have good ratings?  They're safe and...  They're safe and...  They're safe and...  I had a doctor giving a facelift.  I have an ankle by my ear. 
[03:11:00]  I look like Stonehenge.  Fake teeth.  I'm so much older than I'd like to tell people.  I'll be 71 years old.  I forget the Botox, most likely.  I actually have a Botox pub dead with a garden hose.  That just looks like they put like...  I don't know what it is. 
[03:11:30]  They put like a prosthetic chin on him.  He's got a big fucking face.  Like it's SNL makeup.  It's not even like a double chin.  It's just one big fucking face.  It really does look like the face accompaniment to a fat suit.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's a great call.  They put the face pad suit on and now they got to do the body.  I look like Jiminy Glick.  There it is.  And you knew that was going to work, you fuck.  Jiminy Glick.  His fucking hairdo.  Is that his hair? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  It does look like his face.  It looks the same face.  I'm sure.  I feel like a blonde locks now.  It tastes up like a younger man.  Like a younger man.  A good spiky hairdo.  Is that, uh...  Can we see Scott's...  Let's talk a little bit about that.  Very wiggy.  Is that real?  Yeah, that's his photograph.  Yeah, that's his face.  Jesus.  That's his photograph, but is that his hair? 
[03:12:30]  Is it real?  Oh, everything in there is real.  Oh, 41.  Oh, 41.  What?  Hey, baby.  Hey, baby, do you want to lay down?  Let me say, baby.  What time does the show go?  From 6 to 10?  Yep.  It's the big show.  You're a shy sunsteader.  Well, why don't we continue?  Another classic Scott and Todd bit we're about to hear.  The unwanted celebrity spawn organization.  Yes.  Which just seems racist.  What's that about?  Well, this is how they started the show this morning, and I couldn't... 
[03:13:00]  For some reason, when Scott and Todd do it, and they're laughing in the background, it's  all in good fun, but I feel like if we aired this as ours, the show would be in a lot  of trouble.  We'd be fired.  So fired.  So fired.  Let's listen in.  The Big Show.  Big Show.  Big Show.  Scott, Todd, Patty, Joe. 
[03:13:30]  BLG.  The dirty little secret is out.  Celebrities having babies out of wedlock and never acknowledging their existence.  But now, UCS, Unwanted Celebrity Spawn, an organization trying to reunite these illegitimate  children with their famous parents, is trying to help.  Meet Cecile, a 22-year-old.  I can't even follow this setup.  I can't even follow this setup.  What's the point of this fucking thing?  I can't even fucking figure out what they're talking about.  Keep shit basic. 
[03:14:00]  That's sort of basic.  We have a Sunday spot on a bunch of dairy.  That's for it.  There's people who want this to go back, so...  A slits bar.  Did you follow the setup?  Yes.  Their famous parents is trying to help.  Meet Cecile, a 22-year-old Las Vegas dancer.  People always make fun of my name growing up.  I would ask my mom's wise people so mean.  And she'd say they're just jealous of you, Cecile the Entertainer. 
[03:14:30]  You should be proud of you, family name.  I wish my father were around to help me.  But my mom said that he died in the war.  So, I went back to see if he died a hero.  But it turns out, there were no war 22 years ago.  What the fuck are we listening to?  Just get you fucking mad.  She's a black girl.  That watermelon, eat that watermelon, eat that watermelon.  She only is good.  Eat that watermelon, eat that watermelon, eat that watermelon. 
[03:15:00]  She only is good.  Point I'm making is those people shouldn't be allowed to vote.  Black lives go in the days.  They shouldn't be allowed to intermarry with whites.  When I changed the law during my third facelift.  I allowed them to vote.  Jim Crowell is actually a guest on my radio show.  Do we get the answer to this?  Well, it's not over.  It continues?  All right, let's see what this is about. 
[03:15:30]  For years, I searched high and low to find my pops.  I hired private dictictives I found on Google.  And it turns out my dad is comedian extraordinaire Cedric the Entertainer.  Now, with the helps of UCS, I've been in contact with my daddy.  But he knows the...  We got to do this in parts or we're going to lose the entire audience.  Look, yeah, yeah.  Because this goes on forever and it's fucking horrendous.  This is great.  I don't know what this is. 
[03:16:00]  Could you please explain the plot to me?  And I do want to point out that there's a woman on Maury.  Maury, guess what her fucking name is?  Oh.  What?  Two teens, two babies, two men.  Who's the dad?  Her name, I swear to God, is Allegra.  Allegra.  Allegra?  Jesus.  Is that a drug?  Yeah, for allergies.  Yeah.  I would not.  Allegra.  Allegra-en.  Her name's Allegra.  There you go. 
[03:16:30]  Allegra.  Allegra.  And she's got pink hair.  Yeah.  Is that natural?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course it is real natural.  Yes, I've been in contracts with my daddy, but he doesn't believe I'm his kid.  I say to him, I always wears hats and glasses, and my last name is The Entertainer.  You must be my father, but still like that Genesis song?  No reply.  I hope one day we'll be a happy family, and he puts me up in that Honeymoon or sequel 
[03:17:00]  or at the very leases, Barbershop 3 or The Cleaner 2.  He's got lots of monies, and I'm going to get me some.  If you think you might be a UCS, unwanted celebrity spawn, even if there's only the remotest of possibilities,  contact us at our corporate headquarters behind the Wendy's in Bakersfield, California.

[03:17:30]  And then they go into the music and the laughing and the lasers.  Did you notice how long the URL, the website URL was?  Oh, I didn't notice that.  It's much longer than your typical, and some of the characters were out of place.  Yeah, where they would never be in a real URL.  That's the funny part.  Well, you see, that was Cedric the Entertainer's illegitimate daughter. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Which is why she spoke like a...  Why is that supposed to be funny, though?  Yeah, we don't really get it.  Well, the thing is...  Sure, sure, sure.  What, Scott?  Most people always have broken wedlock.  This is what they do.  They're in their misbehaving ways.  They're not like us. 
[03:18:30]  Remember the first time my teeth fell out in the whites-only fountain?  Colored by the name of Mr. Jacobson.  I said, pick them up, boy.  And then Tuma dropped a jar of molasses or honey or whatever it was.  I said, honey jars.  Honey jars.  Was it honey?  Of course it was.  Because back then, that's what I used to keep my dentures in.  An old Tuma would come through with the honey and slap my teeth in my mouth.  He threatened to put my head under the cartwheel. 
[03:19:00]  So I stopped dropping his honey jars.  Tuma?  Yeah, he called me red.  He said, I will hurt you, Scott.  All the bees were stinging me.  My face swelled up.  It's still swollen.  That's why my face was swollen.  Because Tuma's bees were stinging me.  Tuma's bees.  Tuma's bees stung him in the face. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  While he was getting honey to keep the stentures in his mouth.  The good sticky honey.  Yeah, my teeth kept falling out.  Every time Robert's falling, I'm bouncing basketball off my head.  He'd tell me to cry sportsman.  So I got some honey for my dentures.  A bee stung my face.  And Arnie Hudson fucked my face.  Arnie Hudson used to fuck my face twice a week.  He'd take out one of those.  Oh, shit.  I think we're done, Sam. 
[03:20:00]  What?  Why do you think we're done?  Is there more?  You think that they...  Not of that bit.  That bit is...  That bit is done.  Thank God.  Oh, wait.  We could continue because it's Todd's phone scam.  Oh, I love the phone scam.  Todd used to do...  The benchmark.  Well, I guess he continues to do phone scams.  Yes.  He parlayed this into a lot of CDs that he could buy.  Yes.  A lot of prank phone calls on CDs.  The problem is the FCC finally told all radio shows they can't do prank calls anymore. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, it's illegal.  So if he's still doing phone scams...  He's crazy.  He's going against the law?  Oh, well.  I know.  See, it's all set up, Sam.  I hate to tear down a wall today, but...  They're all fake.  They're all fake.  I hate to disagree.  The set up is fake.  The people involved are fake.  Teeth are fake.  Probably stupid sales...  The hair is fake.  The face is fake.  The skin is fake.  Probably some stupid salesperson has to play the victim.  Today, you're the victim.  We're going to call your cubicle, make believe this is real type shit.  Is it obvious it's fake? 
[03:21:00]  I listened to this, and he calls a shipping company, so this one wasn't fake.  Oh, then it can't be fake.  He didn't call salespeople.  He called the shipping company.  So there's two things that are going on.  They will play old phone calls, make believe they just did it when they were legal, or they're  brand new, and it's all fake.  I mean, this one seems new, so they're probably...  Let's find out.  Yeah, I have a special package that I need to get shipped to a friend very fast.  Oh, no.  So I called a company...  That's very funny. 
[03:21:30]  That's Monkey Boy.  Yeah, but that doesn't make sense yet, because we don't know why he's shipping it fast.  Obviously, some kind of...  No, Monkey Boy is their producer.  Name's Monkey Boy.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken, butter and fried chicken, dipping a little chicken,  fried chicken, fried chicken, fried chicken.  So he would pull up...  What was funny about I have a package to ship to a friend?  I don't know, because there was no reveal why that would be funny. 
[03:22:00]  I have a package to ship to my friend.  Maybe his choppers came popping out right then, and they all started laughing at him.  His choppers.  Yes, he has to chew free-dent gum.  That's what he's always going...  They catch him around going, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  And they're like, what are you humming?  And he goes, feel free to chew free-dent.  In a commercial, free-dent gum was horrendous.  Free-dent.  It's like, didn't stick to your choppers. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, free-dent.  He's going to try to chew a piece of hubba-bubba.  You want a piece of free-dent?  No, I'm having fucking hubba-bubba.  Look, big fucking chunk of gum.  That's how he gives himself away when he's on a date with a younger chick who's a fan of the show.  All right, I want a piece of free-dent.  You want a free-dent?  Why would I...  No.  I have hubba-bubba.  You want a piece?  Hum.  Hubba-bubba.  Oh, that could be a problem.  He just holds it in his mouth and hopes like he can just suck the taste off it because his breath stinks like fucking denture juice. 
[03:23:00]  Coffee and denture juice.  Old denture juice.  Old denture juice that's just building up in his mouth.  And he fucking...  He takes a good bite of the hubba-bubba and he gets so caught up, his teeth just walk away.  Fuck.  No, this is delicious.  It's like Michael.  Oh, my God, Father.  Yeah, he feels that the hubba-bubba is stickier than the denture cream and he knows if he opens his mouth that plate's coming down.  Or both teeth are going to be like either hanging from the top or stuck to the top. 
[03:23:30]  He'll start eating over the top of two sets of teeth.  He'll be mashing it between his gum and the fucking top of the fake teeth.  His palate.  The roof of his mouth.  The roof of his mouth and the top of the fucking...  The roof of my mouth is a little birth defect.  I'm really a young man.  Yeah, his teeth are just mocking him steadily, unmoving.  It just squished hubba-bubba coming out.  Yeah.  It looks like the way a body looks after a train is running over. 
[03:24:00]  Or like your ball skin would look through the zipper.  That's how hubba-bubba was coming between his stupid coffee-stained teeth.  His denture juice.  His crust smells like denture juice.  Let's go to Gerald.  Gerald, sorry.  Gerald.  Gerald?  I don't know what I'm trying to say there.  I'm still having a denture juice.  Hey.  I'm a fancy man.  Yes.  Gerald.  God sounds a lot like Spock. 
[03:24:30]  It should be Spock and Todd show.  Everybody sounds like this when they're talking over their denture juice.  I think they were.  I have been and always will be your friend, Captain.  Jim.  Where are they going to come flying out of his maw?  God, that was a good movie.  Oh, you got to love that one.  Let's go to the phone scam.  Find out why he's got to ship a package so goddamn fast.  Love to laugh.  Yeah, I have a special package that I need to get shipped to a friend very fast. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, no.  So I call the company's main office.  Why such menace?  I trouble one of their drop-off locations.  This is overnight head.  Oh, my gosh.  What do you think they help you?  Yeah, maybe you can help me out.  I got kind of a problem.  Certainly.  I was just in one of your stores in Manhattan.  Mm-hmm.  And I was trying to ship something, and your people gave me a lot of grief.  They said I got to call you up.  What are you shipping?  It's a human head.  Is this?  Hold on.  Hold on.  A human head. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  How much older is this?  You hear he's like, yeah, so I called up this place to ship something, and they're just  going to ship it.  Is this replaying an old call, you think?  No, this is Todd doing the call.  Oh, okay.  Because I was going to say it.  Then it goes, hey, how you doing?  Oh, my team is fine.  Otherwise, that's a dead giveaway.  Oh, okay.  I mean, Todd is the real sort of prankster and humorous one.  Oh, that is Todd.  He's the crazy one.  Shipping a human head.  I like the fact that he goes right forward.  Like, there's no beating around the bush. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, no.  A little lead up.  Yeah.  What do you, hey, I have to send something.  What do you have?  Box of cunts.  Shokes over, idiots.  Have a good day.  They said I got to call you up.  What are you shipping?  It's a human head.  A human head?  From New York to California, and they say I can't do it.  We don't take body parts, sir.  You what?  We don't take body parts through our service.  Well, see, I sent a tow before.  Well, did they know what it was?  I mean, we just don't take body parts, sir. 
[03:26:30]  I mean, I think you're going to have a problem.  Is Stalker Patty two-timing us?  Yeah.  Sounds like a problem.  I think you're going to have a problem.  No, Stalker Patty doesn't work in shipping.  You want some coffee?  I want to ship a head.  Well, we don't take body parts.  No, no, it talks.  You're going to ship my head over there with the dentures and everything.  The dentures.  Dentures.  Dentures.  I hope he gets like real.  I hope he gets like he falls down and he's disoriented, and he falls out of his mouth in front of his date, 
[03:27:00]  and he puts him in backwards like when Tyson put his mouthpiece in backwards and he got knocked down.  Oh, what's wrong, lady?  You're 24.  You're perfect for me.  I'm a young demographic.  Oh, shit.  My dentures fell out into a pile of manure.  I was in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and a large Negro punched me in the back of the head, and my dentures fell out.  It's just some manure.  I had to pick my dentures up, put them in my pocket.  Holy shit. 
[03:27:30]  I had to wipe manure off with my hanky.  My hanky.  He's got a hanky.  It was a wedding.  I had to pull it on the top of my tuxedo jacket here.  Well, I sent a toe to Georgia, and I also sent a nose.  Let me see.  Let me put you through to our other department.  Hold on, please.  Okay.  Get the head department.  Nose department.  Our customer service representatives will take your call as soon as possible.  Sir, is this medical research?  Oh, no.  No. 
[03:28:00]  What's it for?  For my friend, so we can have a look-see.  Let's see.  Hold on, please.  Come on.  Let me get back there.  You got her stumped.  Just think for a minute.  Thank you for holding, sir.  I just checked in Memphis, and I'm sorry.  We will not take that for you.  We do not ship.  You know, DHL pulled the same s*** on me.  Well, I'm sorry, sir.  One of their drivers flipped me off one time.  I yanked all my business from them.  Their stock hit the skids.  Now, what?  I mean, what am I going to do?  It's going to decay.  Unfortunately, that's your problem. 
[03:28:30]  It'll be all smashed and cracked if I got to keep it out for a week.  It's in a jar.  Right.  It's not just a head.  I'm not trying to cram it in an envelope.  Now, I understand, sir, but they said they will not take it because I checked with Memphis.  The only thing they'll do it is for medical research going to a medical location.  I want my friend to get a look-see at it.  Try another service, sir.  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't hang up.  You're on WPLJ and you've been phone scammed.  How do you feel?  Wonderful. 
[03:29:00]  Sounded wonderful, didn't she?  It was funny to her later.  All right.  It was a real phone call.  Definitely a real phone call.  Here's the deal.  Thank you, Mike, in Minnesota.  I moved from New York over 11 years ago, and I heard this call long before I left.  Oh, my goodness.  So it's when you could still do prank phone calls.  Right.  Well, let me ask, what was the noise they played?  What's that at the end?  Yes, for years, this has been the song that they play right after the phone scam. 
[03:29:30]  That sounds like him trying to talk without his teammate.  I knew you were going somewhere with that.  That was a Dr. Demento classic, I think.  Dr. Demento, you found that fucking thing.  I believe it's Scott and Todd's.  Is it?  Maybe they redid it or something.  By the way, Scott's, I mean, Todd's New York accent is a put on as well.  Oh, I know.  Todd's not from New York.  He puts on this accent, but when he's on television, he has no accent whatsoever. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's got to go for the Midwest when he's on TV, right?  Yeah, I mean, Scott.  From the time I got punched in the teeth, a black man knocked my teeth on outside of the  Med Gravers trial.  Med Gravers.  Very good.  Punched the side of my lip.  Very good, Sam.  Scott and Todd.  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  Finish up in October for today.  Wow.  Another year gone by, and that's what Scott and Todd have going on. 
[03:30:30]  Thank God.  Every year, they don't disappoint.  No shit.  Oh, I mean, they disappoint every day.  And finally, we got one news story that's worth playing today.  Listen to this dummy.  Latest developments on a hit-and-run.  A man is accused of hitting three people on 95, then speeding off with one of them stuck  in the windshield.  Exclusive eyewitness news video shows the cracked, bloody windshield that impaled a  hit-and-run victim on the highway early Sunday morning.  20-year-old Jose Flores of Central Balls was in the left break. 
[03:31:00]  Did he say he's from Central Balls?  It sounded like Central Balls.  Central Balls, but it did sound like Balls.  It sounded like Central Balls.  Sunday morning, 20-year-old Jose Flores of Central Balls was in the left breakdown lane  of 95 South when this black Honda Civic struck him and his passenger before taking off.  Eyewitness Albert Garcia followed the Civic off the highway and down Branch Avenue, not  even realizing Flores was stuck to the windshield during the nearly two-mile chase. 
[03:31:30]  Swierodowski ran from the scene, but police later tracked him down at his Lynch Street  home, hiding in a closet.  There were already two active warrants out for his arrest, and now the Providence man  faces a slew of new charges.  Garcia tells us he's glad he followed the car, but says it will be tough to get the image  of Flores out of his mind.  The only thing he was moving was his head, and the wiper looked like it crossed his body.  You know what I mean?  Like it stabbed his body. 
[03:32:00]  No, he didn't.  He was holding it, though.  The guy's dead, obviously.  He was holding it, though.  No.  What was the story about the homeless guy who got hit by that woman and got stuck in her  windshield, and she took it into her garage, and he was begging her to let him out?  Yeah, for a couple days or something.  And he lived, though, right?  Yeah.  Did he live or die?  I think he ended up, uh...  Man.  It was a movie, right?  I think he had to have lived, or how would we know he was begging for his life?  She might have said it, or her husband might have said it.  Yeah.  Well, this guy, uh...  Dan? 
[03:32:30]  This guy isn't dead yet, but he is in serious condition.  But the, uh...  What was with that homeless guy?  That was an old story.  I can't remember that.  Yeah.  Remember the moose?  I'm not dead yet!  The moose is the best.  The moose.  I think we gave that moose a good teasing.  Yes, we did.  We gave him a fine ribbing.  Maybe we could play that at, uh...  At, uh...  11 o'clock for the Peoples, because that was really, really funny.  We had a moose.  I vaguely remember that story.  Are we in front of the moose shitting or something?  We could do it after the break, because we're done. 
[03:33:00]  I have to plug real quick, if I could.  November 25th, Stress Factory, New Brunswick.  Uh, one night only.  Night before Thanksgiving.  Or as I call it, Turkey Day.  And I'll be doing all...  After every joke, I'm gonna go, like, uh...  It's good to be back.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm gonna have little turkey feathers on.  Oh, good gosh.  And January 15th, 16th, Martin Luther King Birthday Weekend.  I'll be at the Borgata in Atlantic City.  Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do it every year that weekend.  Friday and Saturday only this year.  I, um...  I have the, uh, uh, Joe...  Uh, brother Joe plug. 
[03:33:30]  Ah!  For 2U.  Yes, 2U.  Playing all the best, uh, U2 songs.  He's gonna do a two-and-a-half-hour show on Saturday, October 31st.  That's a Halloween-y show with 2U at the State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia.  It's Virginia.  Go to notu2.com for ticket info.  Notu2.com.  Very good.  There you go.  All right, with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow?  Yes! 
[03:34:00]  Hopefully the moose story next after the break.  Moose.  Before we run a fast, if we have time.  I don't know.  We'll find out.  Oh, he lived. </pre>
