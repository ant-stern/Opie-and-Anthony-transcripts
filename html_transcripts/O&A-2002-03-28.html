<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with in-studio guest Jim Brewer recounting, in highly offensive terms, his experiences with the births of his two children, focusing on his wife's behavior during each pregnancy.  This was followed by an extended and humorous segment chronicling the arduous attempts to get the Iron Sheik to record a simple promotional announcement, resulting in a series of rambling, nonsensical pronouncements.  Similar attempts with other personalities were also highlighted, showcasing varying degrees of success (or lack thereof).  The Sheik's recording was later used for a Stacker 2 commercial.

The hosts then shifted to a discussion about their upcoming appearance on Bill O'Reilly's show, expressing apprehension based on a previous negative experience with a 20/20 segment about FCC complaints against them.  They speculated on O'Reillyâ€™s potential interview lines of questioning, including crude jokes about the Olsen twins and their own divorce, anticipating heavy editing of the segment.  They also discussed their appearance on the show concerning the corruption of American children, expecting a negative portrayal.  The segment included humorous anecdotes about the taping and their strategic approach to the interview.

This transitioned into listener call-ins: one repeatedly singing Donna Summer songs, another singing Pat Benatar songs.  This was followed by a comedic bit featuring Jim Norton's offensive "motivational tapes."  The Iron Sheik's failed promotional announcement was played again, prompting further amusement from the hosts and Brewer.  Comedian Stephen Lynch called in, discussing his "bowling song" and his surprising wealth.

The show continued with a segment featuring listener-submitted "F.U." messages targeting various groups.  This led to a discussion of Rich Voss's *Def Comedy Jam* appearance, focusing on Voss's perceived increasingly "black" demeanor and the often hostile audiences at comedy shows like *Def Comedy Jam* and *Showtime at the Apollo*.  Lewis Black then joined the show in studio, contributing to a discussion about a recent dog mauling case in San Francisco involving alleged sexual activity between the victim and the dog.  The hosts also engaged in a humorous exchange with a caller, Cheryl, whose deep voice led to them repeatedly misgendering her.

The program shifted to a debate on Cartoon Network's decision to stop airing Speedy Gonzales cartoons due to perceived offensive stereotypes.  This sparked a broader discussion about other potentially offensive cartoons and their historical context.  The show concluded with a live performance by the band Seven Dust, generating considerable excitement from the hosts and Brewer, interspersed with various unrelated side conversations and comedic interjections.  The broadcast also included a song about drowned Cuban refugees.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show!  Hello.  Good afternoon.  Who are you?  Just a friendly little nigger.  What?  That's right, I said it.  Jesus.  Hey, listen, if we're gonna get crazy, let's do it, hammer.  Ouch.  Who are you?  We haven't seen you in so long, we don't know who you are.  I was on the witness protection program.  Were ya?  Yeah, but now I'm back.  All right, a couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027. 
[00:00:30]  Not one phone ringing in New York yet, so come on, give us a call.  Anywhere else outside of New York, you can use 866-277-4WOW.  In studio today, Jim Brewer!  I remember about, it has to be close to a year ago, I said, ah, dude, I gotta go away for  a while, my wife's having a kid.  I'll see you in a few months.  Your kid's gotta be like 5 now. 
[00:01:00]  I almost went AWOL, man.  I couldn't come up here, I was too angry.  Too angry?  Yes.  There should be a...  I'm not gonna condone what that lady did, but I'll tell you what, man.  I understand.  I understand.  DK, I almost went Norton on D a couple times.  I almost went Norton on her a couple times.  Really?  I can't even tell you, I wanted to, I wanted to blow up the car.  I threatened her, I just wanted to leave.  I couldn't come up here.  That bad?  I'm trembling right now.  Give me a second to think. 
[00:01:30]  What was the problem, though?  Bad labor?  Remember?  Dude, she was, first of all, chicks when they're pregnant, when she started hitting, she was  fine like 7, 8 months.  Uh-huh.  But when she started hitting late 8, who are you laughing at, man?  He laughs at everything.  And she's gotta sit on her side every night.  It's the mental abuse.  It's just, it's beyond hardcore.  That bad?  It's beyond nuts.  Your feet, what smells?  Your feet.  Is it just all of a sudden you're like the worst human being on the face of the earth? 
[00:02:00]  What do you get?  You can't leave the house.  I don't want to talk about it now.  I'm really cranky about it.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  I just kind of want to know, because you've been gone for a while from this program.  We were a little worried.  We were kind of getting worried.  We were going to send out a search party.  We didn't know where our pal went.  And then there was, you know, you had already gone through the miracle and wonder that is childbirth.  I was like, migraines and migraines.  Really?  I had the kid, yeah.  Yeah, you know.  And then all of a sudden, you have another one, and it was a little different.  It seemed like all of a sudden, Brewer's not around, you know, making wacky comedy of it. 
[00:02:30]  You know, the first child, it was a whole thing.  I mean, if you go see Brewer, you will laugh your friggin' ass off.  That's 20 minutes of your show.  When he's describing everything.  His wife's pregnancy, the childbirth, the clown that he is having to be involved with stuff like this.  The hemorrhoids.  It's hysterical.  And then the second kid, and it's like, we hear nothing.  We hear nothing.  All of a sudden, I don't think Brewer thinks it's as funny as the first one for some reason. 
[00:03:00]  Well, first of all, it wasn't funny.  She had an easy pregnancy.  Yeah.  It just came right out.  It slid right out.  We walked in.  Slid right out.  It was night and day.  It was night and day.  She had someone there 24-7.  Yeah.  You need anything.  You need anything.  You need two niggers banging you up.  More time than I want him out of here.  Because this is an outing.  Things that Brewer has done since he's been missing.  Brewer, what's wrong with you?  What, did you join the Klan?  Did you join the Klan, Brewer?  I was going to say, have you joined a group?  Dude, no. 
[00:03:30]  I'm just, I haven't been out a long time, so.  All right.  Do you need anything?  Do you need a little, you know?  Oh, it just feels good.  We're going to have.  I can use it.  Where's Stinky at?  Yeah, yeah.  Stinky has a new name.  What is it?  No longer Stinky.  Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  Because he's an awesome Garrett.  Because our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  You ever hear a...  You want to say hi to awesome Garrett?  I have a kid and there's a song by awesome Garrett.  Our God is an awesome God.  You never heard that? 
[00:04:00]  Our God is an awesome God.  He does things and he's God.  Hey, awesome Garrett.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  It's awesome Garrett.  Garrett.  How cool is it for awesome Garrett that now, like, the stinky thing can go away and you're  awesome Garrett?  Thank God.  Is it awesome?  It's awesome, guys.  It's awesome Garrett.  But it's still Club Stinky.  Oh, definitely.  Can't be Club Awesome under new management.  I'm the only thing that's awesome. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Awesome Garrett.  Our Garrett's an awesome Garrett.  Is this something awesome Garrett came up with?  No, this is just something that kind of happened.  I think Norton came up with it.  And then the listeners seem to be backing this new name, this change in name.  You know how they just threw away new Coke?  They took new Coke and didn't like it.  And the consumer, and no matter how much they tried to push it, it didn't work.  Awesome Garrett.  The public is accepting it.  They're moving on from stinky.  Thank God. 
[00:05:00]  Awesome Garrett.  He's going to have a theme song and everything soon.  Oh, Garrett is an awesome Garrett.  Garrett has nice abs and tussleable hair.  Are you getting a mullet?  Look at his hair.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Ready to go to Babylon.  He is.  He's screwing around.  What is that hair in the back?  He's going to be part of mullet of the day.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  All right.  Awesome Garrett.  Awesome Garrett.  There he is.  Call him up.  You could talk to him on the phone.  There's awesome Garrett.  He looked like that kid was afraid to come up to the fast pitcher when he came in here. 
[00:05:30]  Didn't he?  Yeah.  He just kind of walks up.  What's happening?  What's happening?  Hi.  What?  I'm awesome Garrett.  What's wrong, Jim?  That's awesome Garrett.  I'm awesome.  Is the high still the same?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That didn't change.  Then it's still stinky.  Stinky.  It'll be a little harder for some people to change.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  We're going to have a blast.  We've been having a blast, bro, in here.  Very good.  And we missed you.  God damn it.  I missed you guys.  I need some giggles.  I feel good.  Well, we got lots of giggles today.  We have fun from the Iron Sheik.  Nice.  From yesterday.  Right in front of me.  We had the Iron Sheik in here yesterday.  Let's play this.  It was a lot of fun.  But he went inside, as do many of the people that appear on the show, to do a little promo  thing for us.  You know how they say, hey, it's blah, blah, blah, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:06:30]  And then we play it in and out of commercials.  Hey, Ben, why don't you give us an example of...  Give us a good example of somebody that's done...  Has done it the right way.  The right way.  Is he a big dude?  Is he...  Oh, God damn, yeah.  I wouldn't mess with him, man.  Really?  He's big.  He's old big.  You know those big old guys?  Yeah.  Big, solid.  Barrel, barrel, barrel, body.  Straight up belly.  Very good.  You need like four guys.  Terranoran.  Recoron wrestling. 
[00:07:00]  Recoron.  Recoron.  Yeah, just give us one where the guy just did it normally.  Oldest country in the world of Terranoran.  I'm from Terranoran, the oldest country of the Recoron wrestling.  All right, so you guys have heard these things.  You know, we have a lot of these celebrities on the show.  Brewer's done them.  Yeah, you just come on and say, hey.  Hey.  Like, here's Ted Nugent helping us out.  Hey.  Working hard, playing hard, America.  This is your blood brother of all things Sonic Bombast, Ted Nugent.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll. 
[00:07:30]  There you go.  There you go.  Easy.  And even that is, like, long, but he did well with it because he has a lot of personnel.  Even the you-know-what can manage that.  Probably took him one take.  One take.  Steve from foundrymusic.com is in the studio.  And, Steve, what happened after the interview yesterday?  Well, it was actually before the interview.  I got introduced to the Iron Sheik by Rick, and immediately I knew that this was going to be a long recording session 
[00:08:00]  because the guy was having trouble with hello.  And we even have a script for you dicks.  It just says, hey, it's, put your name here, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's all you have to really do.  Right.  And it's written right up in my studio, and I told him, basically, as long as your name and Opie and Anthony is in it,  go nuts, have fun, it can be whatever you want to be.  Right.  And he launches into this really long time.  He's retarded, man. 
[00:08:30]  You know, maybe you never know.  Nobody knows that the Sheik man's really retarded.  He's obviously retarded.  The Sheik man is retarded.  Just teach him to say this.  All right, so we have tape of Steve working it with the Iron Sheik here, trying to get something going on.  Oh, it's painful.  It gets funnier and funnier.  This is about four minutes long.  Basically, it's whatever you want to say, whatever you want to say, as long as you, your name, and Opie and Anthony is in it,  whatever you want to say.  Okay. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, just do it.  Can you tell me when I go?  This is the Iron Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation champion.  Pleasure for me to the Anthony and Opie, they're bringing me to the WNEW.  It's one of the number one station in the Manhattan and New York.  And pleasure to have come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans and hello to all people, to the wrestling, to the WNEW station.  Number one radio station in New York. 
[00:09:30]  And pleasure to have be here.  Good.  Oh, it doesn't end there.  No.  Now, all Steve wants, and you can tell every time Steve asks him, is just say, hey, it's the Iron Sheik, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's all we need.  That's all you want it.  Right.  So listen, Steve again will try to make him say it.  And he goes off on a tear.  Sheik.  Here we go.  And he says pretty much the same exact thing.  Same thing every time. 
[00:10:00]  But it peaked out a little.  What do you mean?  Oh, could you want to stumble?  Yeah, yeah, let's try to get...  Is it the WNEW?  Don't even say the station.  Don't even say the station.  Because this will go out in like 18 cities.  Oh, right.  Just to mention New York.  You remember that for a second.  Don't even mention New York.  You don't want to.  We'll try a short one.  We'll try a long one.  Okay.  So you just tell me anything, especially when I...  Or just talk about my...  As long as your name and Opie and Anthony is in it?  Right.  Perfect.  Have fun.

We're drinking Heineken's.  I called the guy, Jabroni, screwing around with him, and he chokeslam me on his bed.  On his bed?  Ooh.  Hold me down and won't let me get up.

We need a new tape of Jim Brewer so we can leave.  So we can leave early.  We can leave at 6.30 down the road.  We're taping here.  You know we do that.  It's tradition.  If we have somewhere to go and we can't stay with the program until 7 o'clock, we throw on a Brewer bit.

This is great for Long Island, New York, anywhere around the country, I'm sure.  But if you're from New York...  We had a garage.  ...and you're from Long Island, you had, yeah, tree forts.  A lot of people in the woods.  Some of the mole people made the little underground forts. 
[00:27:00]  Dude.  Ross Pertosi's house in the backyard, underground tree forts.  Really?  Come on.  Underground.  How deep.  I've heard of this.  At least five or six feet.  Come on.  Here's how you constructed it.  Underground with plywood.  You dig it, and then you dug wood in.  Huge holes.  Yeah.  And then, on top of the hole, you laid in two-by-fours, like roof rafters.  Yep.  And still below the surface.  Then you laid plywood on top of that.  Yep.  Then you buried the whole thing under the dirt and put some grass back on there. 
[00:27:30]  Do you know that would lead to, like, the ultimate army game ever?  It did, you know.  I mean, the hugest triumph ever.  We would have that, yeah.  It was a place to go for the rock fights.  The guys with the ground forts in the backyard had a definite advantage over the tree forts  in the yard-to-yard Long Island rock fights.  You ever take hostages?  No.  Oh, little brothers and stuff.  You grew up like the kid named Elmo.  Come here.  How do you get Elmo?  Leave him alone.  We're not going to hurt him, faggot. 
[00:28:00]  We got you, little brother, dick.  I'm telling my mother, whatever, faggot.  We're not going to hurt him.  It would always start.  Tie him up.  He'd start crying.  Maybe a neighbor would be putting in an in-ground pool or something,  so they had a big pile of dirt, and they'd go,  with the dirt bombs, you know, the big dirt bombs.  Get to the bottom.  I don't want it.  I don't want it.  I don't want it.  Tommy, don't hit Elmo.  It would start as a dirt bomb fight, and, you know,  eventually you run out of dirt bombs, and some son of a bitch goes,  picks up a rock, wails it over the fence without even looking, 
[00:28:30]  and he goes, ah!  And it just turns into a melee.  Nice going, dick.  You ruined it.  Great.  We were all having fun.  Way to go, Jeff.  Dirt bombs.  Who threw the rock?  I didn't know there was a rock in it.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  It was a dirt bomb with a rock in it.  I didn't know, right?  Fine.  Don't believe me.  Don't believe me.  No more horrific scene than looking through the slats and the fence,  picking your targets,  and seeing the mom or, God forbid, dad of the house that you're throwing at, 
[00:29:00]  come running out the back door.  Run, dick.  Run.  Did you do the acorns?  Collect the acorns?  Yeah.  You get to the point where you throw anything that's on the ground.  Dirt bombs were great because as a kid, when they hit something,  they made that puff of smoke, and it was cool.  It was like a bomb.  Then you had the one crazy kid who'd get, like, the cicada.  Oh, she's throwing it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Don't do that, dick. 
[00:29:30]  That ain't funny.  You ran from a cicada, you little faggot.  Don't do that.  He goes and picks it up.  Don't pick it up.  Oh, those damn things.  Come on.  Come on.  Ours are the nastiest things.  It doesn't even bite.  You're such a pussy.  Dick.  You're such a pussy.  Put it down, Tommy.  Isn't that funny, man?  He hated those things, though.  They're on the side of the trees.  Are you just walking around the side?  We go, is it dead? 
[00:30:00]  You give it a kick.  Run.  I got one.  It's coming for you.  Oh, oh, oh.  Shut up, dude.  I heard they're like bats.  They get tangled in your hair.  Classic.  We had a big tree fort out there in East Iceland, Long Island.  Me and my brother.  East Iceland, Long Island.  Why is that funny?  The mean streets of East Iceland.  No, because I just got the vision.  Yeah.  A cicada's like a bomb coming. 
[00:30:30]  If you're, like, up in a tree, like, five feet up, there's eight, ten of you, dude.  Check out this planet.  Oh, my God.  You're just flying out the window.  Jimmy broke his arm.  That's what happened.  This kid broke his friggin' leg, fell out of our tree fort, wrecked the whole thing.  So my father's like, tear it down.  I wrecked it, dick.  We had the rock fights and the dirt bomb fights from yard to yard with the various forts.  It's like a, you know, it's like a little battle going on between the kids in the neighborhood.  No chicks. 
[00:31:00]  No.  No.  There was an occasional tomboy that would kind of go around,  but you kept her out of the battles.  Well, we had, like, a playhouse in the back of Phil's house.  You had a playhouse for his sister.  Dude, those playhouse things, though, were faggot.  No, but listen.  Like, treehouse, cool, underground.  When you had, like, the thing with the windows and the curtains and the dolls inside.  Faggot.  It's faggot unless you climb and sit on the roof, dick.  All right, I'll give you that. 
[00:31:30]  We used to show up.  I was such a dick.  And I was a fat kid.  And I'd hang out on the roof and I'd go, Phil, put the chair, like, five feet out.  And I would risk my fat life at, like, 15, jump over the chair just so, like, one of the twins would be like,  Oh, my God, he's cool.  Push it further.  I can do it.  You're going to get hurt, Jim.  Do it, faggot. 
[00:32:00]  For I punch you.  For I punch you.  And the metal, for some reason, the metal sheds in the back that Pop kept his tools in was never cool to hang out in either.  No, because Mom could see it.  There's too much stuff in there.  Too much, like, dad tools.  Dark and spider webs.  It's too dark and leave it open.  Yeah.  Spider webs.  Spider webs and smell like gasoline.  So you needed your own spot.  It was always a little creepy, too close space.  Yeah.  Space for a kid, you're touching me.  But the frigging backyards, because I know there's some of my friends.  They have the little sisters that had, like, the prefab little house with the curtains. 
[00:32:30]  They're like, dude, hang out in the clubhouse.  It's not a clubhouse.  It's an overgrown dollhouse faggot.  And I shan't be hanging out there.  Unless you're on the roof.  Go to the woods.  I never went to the roof, but okay.  I never thought about a second story on him being cool.  J.R., what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Rua.  Hammer.  Listen, I live in Brooklyn.  We dug the most dangerous forts possible.  We used to have them run electrically by car batteries. 
[00:33:00]  That sounds dangerous.  God, why didn't we think of that?  Listen, we dig a hole.  We have flashlights.  They look like a crater hit the earth.  We cover it with guardrails and stolen car hoods.  You know, Long Island, you know something, J.R.?  You point up a great thing, the difference.  It's the same final problem you needed to solve.  You wanted a fort underground.  Out on Long Island, we would go to the various track housing sites that they would put up and steal the lumber. 
[00:33:30]  Steal the wood.  Steal the plywood.  And whatever we could get and make it out of that.  Brooklyn over here is taking guardrails and car trunk lids and hoods.  You know, the good thing about it was, too, there was no brothers in my neighborhood, so they didn't get to come back there.  Oh, jeez.  I'm happy enough to look.  Brewer, you've been to my neighborhood.  You're filming a crooked line down there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember.  The last white neighborhood in Brooklyn.  I don't want to say it over the air because then everyone's going to find out where it is.  White people are afraid in that neighborhood.  Jeez, man.  Yeah, boy, I tell you, that's a party town, and we took it underground. 
[00:34:00]  All right, J.R.  Later.  Thank you.  Chris wants to add to this.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, listen, guys, I grew up in Seacliff, and there was this really pristine golf course, and we built one of these bunkers.  The only...  Hey!  Hey!  Sorry, guys.  Sorry, sorry.  Hey!  I don't...  He gets the whooping monkey.  I don't think this conversation requires vulgarity.  So sorry.  My bad.  Try again. 
[00:34:30]  My bad.  My bad.  Nice language, dick.  I deserve that.  So we used to run up onto the green and grab the golf balls and then run down into this bunker and disappear on the golfers.  Like the Viet Cong of the golf course.  Oh, we hide.  We hide in Tunner.  They'd be running from the woods and we'd just disappear on them.  Hey, Brewer.  Yeah?  Oh, he got you.  Brewer.  That's a new gag that they're pulling on everybody, and you're new to it. 
[00:35:00]  Dude, I started that game, but you've got to get...  Here's a bit.  You've got to get the person to say what.  Right.  That's true.  You did say yeah in a question form.  Yeah!  Oh, I have to say it in a question?  I heard that it was like a what in a yeah form.  That's so gay.  Dude, you're gay for even...  You're gay.  We get a...  You're gay.  We're playing more games on our show, Brewer.  Mark, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I got Brewer.  He said...  I know. 
[00:35:30]  Dude, are you listening?  I'm Brewer.  He's so psyched right now.  The guy is psyched right now.  Calling his ass.  Calling all his friends.  He probably has it on tape.  Go on.com.  And hit rewind.  Watch what he says.  Yeah, yeah.  Dick.  Listen to how freaking stupid he sounds.  He's a retard.  What he does is make noises.  I can do that.  What is that, a monkey?  You know what's really funny?  Watch.  I'll rewind Brewer saying it and then ask him something different beforehand.  Watch.  Because he said yeah like such a dick.  Hey, Brewer.  You a homo? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Dick.  Now I got him saying yeah on tape.  Mark, what's going on?  Stop, man.  You got...  Such a dick.  It's going to be one of those days today.  Hey, hey, hey.  The cursing, howling monkeys have come out.  What are you doing, Mark?  Don't say the S word.  Crap.  I'm sorry, guys.  All right.  What do you want to say?  Norton, did you have a little...  No, Norton.  Brewer, did you have little tea parties in your playhouse on the island? 
[00:36:30]  Tea parties?  It was on the roof, Dick.  Yeah, it was on the roof.  It's cool on the roof.  It's cool on the roof.  All right, later guys.  You got to talk.  I love that, man.  He tries to defend it.  You were in the little playhouse.  Sitting right on the point, man.  And just look down like...  Dick, I was on the roof.  Dick.  Throwing snowballs at the cars.  You can see the next block.  Yeah, of course.  That's cool.  That's right.  That's cool. 
[00:37:00]  Collect a bunch of crab apples to throw at the retarded kid.  No one's home there.  Hit the siding.  It's really loud.  I don't know if we want to do this tonight.  Get aluminum siding.  He's bringing up things that are just like clinking in my head.  These families.  It was a huge deal, man.  When people decided they were getting rid of those cracking asbestos shingles 
[00:37:30]  and the father...  I mean, you're talking friggin' suburbia.  The father looking outside the station wagon in the driveway.  I'm reading the siding with the host.  The perfect suburban American family.  And he's decided, yeah, he's going for it.  He's getting the aluminum siding.  And he's out there.  The trucks are out there.  It's a big neighborhood event to watch it happen.  Finally happens.  And how do the kids appreciate it? 
[00:38:00]  Dude, I bet I could dent...  See the row right under Mary's bedroom window?  The yellow one?  Yeah.  The yellow one.  I will dent it with this friggin' rock.  Never.  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  You'd run for like 20 feet until you realize that no one heard it.  Run!  Shh!  No one heard it.  No one heard it.  You see him out there hosing it down with his suburban dad friggin' hose attachment sprayer 
[00:38:30]  nozzle.  Whoosh!  And then when he gets to the dented thing, he'll just stop and shake his head.  And you know, it's just, damn kids.  I work.  I break my back every day for this.  Hey, you bananas.  Get the hell out of here.  Who's doing this?  Christ, I pay taxes.  And you listen up, Tommy.  You tell your father.  I know he's rented in the Puerto Ricans.  Who did it?  And he's not paying taxes.  It was the mercandeddy child, wasn't it?  I'll talk to his father. 
[00:39:00]  And I was like, oh, he's in trouble.  Bang!  Bang!  Run, run, run, run.  Go on the bushes.  And spelling curse words in the ribs.  Go on the bushes.  You see when you used to have the window air conditioning units?  And you could just take your finger and write in the metal fins that are sticking out  because they're like the thinnest aluminum ever.  So all you go, F, E, U.  There's this poor guy busting his hump to run his house with dented aluminum siding and 
[00:39:30]  the F word written on every air conditioner hanging out his window.  And his retarded kid just got an apple on the side of his head.  And Brew is sitting on his faggy clubhouse in the back.  While plane goes by.  Holy crap, that one was low.  We're under the pattern today.  Seemed like it was landing there, right?  Turn on the closed caption.  I can't hear my program. 
[00:40:00]  Jesus Christ, I'm writing a letter.  This is ridiculous.  And we are not having the Concord come over.  Come on, no.  We're having a rally to keep that damn, goddamn plane.  This is ridiculous.  We're in Long Island.  The friggin' plans of it. 
[00:40:30]  Absolutely not.  I am not living with this goddamn thing.  Let the other people, let the Jews over there and Hewlett deal with that.  I'm not, I work too.  Here comes a nut.  Grab the dog. 
[00:41:00]  What the hell is that?  Jesus Christ, the oil burn is backing up.  Goddamn Concord.  They move into these neighborhoods where planes have been flying over since Lucky Lindy.  And for some reason now it's a problem.  You move there.  What do you think?  They stopped flying on the day you were shown the house?  And they always resorts to this. 
[00:41:30]  I pay taxes.  And I'm just here to let you know I'm not.  Oh, Jesus, you're killing me. 
[00:42:00]  I remember that.  Oh, yeah.  When they first started flying.  Dudes would come out of my blog.  I swear to God, I lived on Hook Creek Boulevard.  These jackasses would yell at each other and have a plan.  This is too low.  Look at that goddamn thing.  You're telling me that's regulation?  Goddamn. 
[00:42:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, when that thing started flying, they thought the other one...  Staying at the porch monkeys are getting closer and closer to our neighborhood.  Ma, if they can afford it, then yeah, but you sell the house, sir.  Holy Jesus, I can't.  Goddamn Concord.  Goddamn Concord.  Long Island rules.  Yeah.  Long Island does rule. 
[00:43:00]  Bravo, Brewer.  I haven't laughed that hard since the last time you were here.  Now you know what that means?  Awesome.  We can leave early sometime in the very near future.  Yeah, there you go.  We might take advantage of that tomorrow.  Right.  Well, I was going to say something, but who cares?  What's that?  Someone gave us a challenge today.  And brought me back.  Oh, man, that's funny.  Some guy wrote out a list of a bunch of groups, at least 30 or 40 in.  Yeah.  And he doesn't think we could make fun of all these groups in one show. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  It doesn't have to be blatant.  It could be a little slip-in sideline thing.  We've already made fun of about five or six of them, though.  The list is up on opianthony.com.  No, I think we made fun of one five or six times so far.  No, we made fun of the...  Does that count?  I don't think we made fun of the Chinese yet, really.  No.  That was the Vietnamese.  Yeah.  Vietnamese.  Oh, we made fun of Arabs, African-Americans.  Thanks, Brewer Dick.  Boston people. 
[00:44:00]  Brooklyn people.  And the Russians so far.  And the cripples.  Stoners.  Stoners.  Stinky.  Dude, you're checking is the worst.  Oh, yeah.  Just hippies.  Cross it out.  Cross it out.  Well, then you can't read it.  The list is up on opianthony.com.  You want to go over the list real fast and see if we can do this?  All right.  We're not going to blatantly do it, though.  If it comes up, something slip in.  Well, the listeners can help us out with this, right?  Sure.  So, this guy, what's his name? 
[00:44:30]  I don't even know his name.  What is it?  Sounds like an email address.  Yeah, that's an email address.  A-REC-007.  There you go.  That's his name.  Okay.  Right.  Here's the list of groups he wants us to make fun of today.  The Polish, Germans.  Two Bullocks walking to a bar.  Hey, watch where you're going, stupid.  Get it?  I guess that counts, Rick.  Okay. 
[00:45:00]  The Germans, the Arabs, the Chinese, the Japanese, Africans, African-Americans, Ethiopians, Portuguese,  Norwegian, French, British, South American, Spanish.  Now, doesn't all that come on the negros?  No, no.  No.  God damn.  Well, in my book, it does there, hush-huts.  This is America.  Wake up, Hammer.  Spanish, Hispanics, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Jamaicans, Brooklyn people, Boston people,  Canadians, white rappers, gays, Russians, Koreans, Czechs, cannibals, mutants, Australians, 
[00:45:30]  college football coaches.  What?  Now, they're all in the same group, and we know what group that is.  All right.  Cubans.  Go get a Drowned Cuban Drowned, Rick.  Like you've never heard them.  Cubans, Persians, Turkish, retards, cripples, bowlers.  We made fun of the bowlers with the Stephen Lynch song to start the show.  Yep.  The people who created the Sims.  What?  George Lucas, the Olympics, stoners, hippies, those TRL screaming fans, spoiled brats,  Ric Flair, Vince McMahon, Tony Saragusa, NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Miss Cleo, Lesbos,

The list is up on opianthony.com.  Great.  We'll take care of the Cubans right now as we take a break.  Uh-oh.  Drowned, drowned, Cuban drowned, drowned, Cuban drowned.

[00:49:00]  Champlin of New York City.  Good night, Scott, good night, Scott, good night.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a very easy show for Ed and I to do today because we've got Jim Brewer in the studio.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  We would love to hear from you today. 
[00:49:30]  And we're giving you guys a heads up.  We're part of Bill O'Reilly's little special tonight, the corruption of the American child.  Yes.  We know we're going to get tooled on.  Are you corrupting?  Yeah, we're corrupting the nation's youth, the children of this fine nation.  I just figured it out.  You went on Newsday.com, right? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  And there's some quotes from you and I.  There's a quote from Opie.  Because it's just a little teaser of the program.  Right.  And your quote, Opie?  Hey, we're...  Here's the quote.  Hey, we're artists.  Oh, man.  Dude.  I said dick.  That's all right.  We're artists.  We've been there.  Now, we taped this about seven months ago.  Yeah.  I think...  We were artists back then?  I think that's when Bill O'Reilly turned to us and said, well, what do you mean by that? 
[00:50:30]  And I went, uh...  I don't know.  Something like art.  You're like hanging out or like paint stuff?  Yeah, yeah.  You're like Pablo Picasso.  Pablo Picasso would never be called an ass blank.  Say there or tonight?  Can't say.  What time is that on?  I've finger painted.  Dude.  Yeah, I made like this ass tray with gold painted macaronis. 
[00:51:00]  I'm an artist.  Yeah, yeah.  Brewer.  It's like what...  Brewer, I gave one of these answers to one of his questions and I'm feeling proud of myself  and then he goes, so what do you mean by that?  I think it might be the artist's question.  I swear there's 20 seconds of me just going...  And I'm praying he uses it, man.  I'm praying I look like a dick.  You know what I was going for?  I'm going to show him, man.  I'm going to bring straight right to this dick's face.  Exactly.  You know what I was doing?  My strategy when I went in there? 
[00:51:30]  And I was using a rule, a little lesson right out of the Reagan, the Ronald Reagan playbook.  And when he would give his speech and Sam Donaldson would ask him a question and he'd be like,  Will Sam let me explain why that's...  And it was like, well, you called him Sam.  Right.  So at every turn I'm going, Bill.  Let me explain something to you, Bill.  Because now I'm familiar with him.  I'm a one-on-one guy.  And people watching will go, just call him Bill. 
[00:52:00]  He knows him.  You want one, Bill?  Bill, you know, when me and you were getting those whores, yours was a guy.  I don't know, whatever.  The crazy Chinese one.  And then we had an offer and bury the body.  If kids saw that, it might affect them.  But all radio show, nothing.  Nothing.  I don't know why we agree to do these things because we always look stupid.  It reminded me of the Honeymooners episode.  You ever see that one where Ralph make-believe to one of his old buddies that he's the head of the Gotham Bus Company and his friend Bill. 
[00:52:30]  And he has to get like this five-minute time period where he can sit at the boss's desk, invite his friend in and get it out before Mr. Marshall gets back.  And he just, as he walks in, he's make-believing he's doing work at the desk.  And then he looks up and he goes, hello, Bill.  That's how I felt.  Well, Bill, I explained it to you, Bill.  Bill, that's an interesting question, Bill.  And I'm going to explain it to you right now.  How's the wife? 
[00:53:00]  Not married.  I don't know.  Bill.  Bill.  You didn't call him Bill once.  No, I tried to diffuse this whole situation by laughing a lot.  Well, yeah, yeah, he'd ask a question and Opie would just go.  Opie would laugh at his questions.  And they were really serious questions, but I'm just like.  That's awesome.  Oh, we didn't take it.  Opie, if you don't believe that the type of program you do could be detrimental to children,  give me an example of something you do that might be positive for the children. 
[00:53:30]  Laughing like he just smoked a big fatty.  And I'm looking at, well, you know, Bill, let me explain.  What time is it?  The best part is.  Bill, I'll tell you the second I think of a good answer.  The best part is our listeners see through this crap and they enjoy it.  Absolutely.  Because it looks like complete tools.  Nine o'clock on the regular Fox.  Yes, it's on Fox.  The television. 
[00:54:00]  All your Fox snores around the country.  You've been there and you can relate to this.  We taped about an hour and a half easily.  We're only going to be on for maybe three minutes.  Yes.  Maybe.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Because they're fitting in a ton of people and I think it's only an hour special, right?  Did you see a copy of it?  No.  Are you kidding?  We know we're doomed.  We know we're doomed.  Well, we just like, um, chew suck niggers.  Hey, guys, it's going to be.  Whoa, I didn't say it like that.  Wait till you see the end result. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, it's going to be all cut up.  Kids should pick up guns and kill each other.  Bill.  Cut it all up.  I didn't say that.  I wasn't even wearing the same thing during the second word.  How did that happen, Bill?  Bill.  Bill O'Reilly.  Bill O'Reilly.  You scared off, Bill.  Who else they got?  Let's see.  Insane Clown Posse, Marilyn Manson.  This is a contributing to the corruption of the American child included in his focus.  I guess this is coming from D.C. 
[00:55:00]  JFK FM's afternoon duo of Opie and Anthony.  It says, O'Reilly attacks ONA.  Uh-oh, did he see in advance?  Oh, no.  He did.  What's it say?  What's it say?  What's it say?  It just says, O'Reilly attacks ONA.  And then it has how we're, like, one of the featured, uh.  You know, ask the guy if we look like dicks.  I want to know if we look like dicks.  Well, this is, uh, just a kind of a news site.  Yeah.  So I guess he was one of the press that has seen in advance of this.  He's a dick.  Oh, well.  That's right.  Everyone's going to be sitting home watching. 
[00:55:30]  Can I tell you something that you really care about?  I find this funny.  Not only do I find it funny, but if you understand that this was taped before September 11th,  the priority of this, and it's ridiculous.  Exactly.  The best part of this, too.  Yeah.  He begged us for so long to be part of this special, and now they're going to just tool  us.  You know, another great thing that I have to look forward to that I'm sure he's going to  include in?  Right before we did this.  They're trying to blame you for their catastrophe.  Right.  Right after we, right before we did this interview with Bill O'Reilly, Bill, the Time article 
[00:56:00]  came out where I made comment to the Olsen twins and how hot they're getting and how  it's just a matter of a couple of years before they're legitimate and legal and completely  bangable.  And he brings it up.  I'm sitting there.  He's like, you've made reference to the Olsen twins and how hot they're getting.  Is that the word you used?  And I'm sitting there like, you know, Bill, you look at them, they're attractive young 
[00:56:30]  girls.  What am I going to say?  I can't backpedal.  I had to go with it.  They're hot pieces of...  They're too hot.  Hope to see them on channel 498 on the Dish Network, if you know what I'm saying, Bill.  You know, Bill, I bet they have the tightest...  than I've ever, ever seen.  Bill, you want to stick your...  inside their...  don't you?  Hello, Bill?  Is this on?  That's what we should have done during the interview. 
[00:57:00]  I think Insane Clown Posse covered that, to tell you the truth.  From what I hear, their portion of it, you know, they're completely in character and...  That's funny.  You know, going off as their Insane Clown Posse type guy.  Isn't it so retarded when you're finally sitting there and you're like, this is the  big Bill Riley, the man who has such an impact on life!  I am news.  Like, you would never want this guy to lead anything, let alone a parade. 
[00:57:30]  Well, he, you know something?  You know what I'm saying?  People believe anyone.  He beats the crap out of Larry King in the ratings.  Fox News has, since 9-11 especially, has become the premier friggin' news network above  CNN.  They're killing because they put their friggin' opinions in on stuff at every turn.  At least CNN for the most part.  Right.  You know, I think every news agency is a little more liberal than you'd like. 
[00:58:00]  Fox tends to go a little more conservative than a lot of the news agencies out there.  But CNN won't editorialize.  Their reporters on Fox are just like, well, you know how those people can be.  And you're like, did he just...  Did I just hear what?  Starts with an N, ends with an S.  You say it, I say it.  It's like ice cream.  You know what the hell we're saying.  They will editorialize at every turn on that station.  You're like, this is the news?  But people tune in in droves. 
[00:58:30]  They love, people love having their minds made up for them.  But you've got to love the fact that they do that, right?  It entertains the crap out of me.  I can't get an up-up.  Plus, they also have live car chases every afternoon.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Huge in L.A.  Dude, if that thing didn't have the loose scroll on the bottom, no one would be watching that  crap channel.  That's all I need.  A little scroll.  That's just hypnotizing.  You walk by, and it could be anything.  You'd be like, look at the top, look at the top, look at the bottom, look at the bottom,  look at the top, look at the bottom, look at the bottom.  I look at the scroll, which I should say, they should change direction every 15 minutes, because  I'm watching for a half hour.  I get up, I walk into a wall. 
[00:59:00]  You ever do that, you get like this dizzies, because you're watching it too long, especially  right after 9-11.  I wanted all the news, all the news, 24 hours a day.  Pipe it into my head while I sleep.  If the news was real, they'd get real people in there.  The real people that are ugly, no one's going to listen to fat, ugly, nasty, with their  own opinions.  I think the real plop, shut up.  That's the real, come on, man.  With their real opinions.  So it's already phony.  Well, so Bill O'Reilly is kicking ass on this.  Let's go fight him.  And we didn't want to even, we honestly fought this tooth and nail going in. 
[00:59:30]  But his producer is like, please, Bill loves you guys.  You guys are going to be great.  You don't have to worry about, and we caved in.  I know why we didn't want to do it, because of the 2020 downtown piece.  Yeah.  Same thing.  We're like, come on, come on, come on, come on.  It'll be cool.  It'll be cool.  Oh, do it.  Do it.  Do it.  And then it was a scum sucking worms.  It was a 10 minute segment on how you can report us to the FCC.  I'm like, oh, thanks.  Yeah, it was pretty much an instructional video on how to report us to the FCC. 
[01:00:00]  It's like, gee, great.  So here's the form you need to fill out.  Right, right.  So we lived through that.  And then, you know, O'Reilly comes to call.  And we're like, no, we're not going to fall for this twice.  We fall for it twice.  Oh, we did.  We absolutely did.  We're frigging idiots.  Do you know how big this can be?  We're idiots.  They're perfect for you, sir.  Oh, tvguide.com says MPAA President Jack Valenti, Cringe Radio DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Cringe Radio DJs. 
[01:00:30]  There you go.  Maybe that line will come out in the...  Coming soon, the Cringe Radio t-shirts.  Cringe Radio t-shirts.  That's brilliant.  It's entertainment.  That is brilliant.  Cringe Radio t-shirts.  What is Cringe Radio?  Can we mock it, Brad?  Explain it to you, Bill.  Bill, sit down.  Relax, let me explain this to you.  Later on, I'll explain a little more in depth when we're at the pub.  Talking about the family, Bill.  Bill, watch.  Watch.  I hope they don't cut out every time I call him Bill.  Count him.  I'm sure it amounts into the tens of times. 
[01:01:00]  As painful as it's going to be for you and I to watch tonight, we will have the audio.  We'll play it tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  If you miss it, we will.  It's going to be genius.  You guys can goof on us, man.  It's going to be pure genius.  We'll give it to you guys so you can throw it right back at us.  You're going to sit there going, all right, let me see what's going on here, man.  Let's see what happens.  Let's see what's really going on here.  Oh, now listen to this stupid line and the way they twist it around.  The Olsen twins?  Hot.  Hot.  Did you say that? 
[01:01:30]  It's like, no.  I said Mary-Kate is the Pris and Ashley looks like the goer.  It's true, Bill.  You can understand, right, Bill?  I absolutely do not remember what I said when I was asked that by him, but I was doing  my best.  Like, I will always do my best to steer the ship in another direction, but that was like,  did you say that the Olsen twins are now getting to an age where you would like to have sex with 
[01:02:00]  them?  What do you say, Bill?  Bill, you know, they're two very cute girls.  What am I saying?  That JonBenet Ramsey was a piece of ass, wasn't she?  What a waste.  I wonder if he's going to talk about your divorce.  No, this was done so far before.  On a final note.  On a final note about O.P. and Anthony.  This just to let you know what scum-sucking, perverted slobs they are. 
[01:02:30]  We're now calling his mommy live to tell her what happened in gory detail.  That was reported in the paper, glossed over.  Somebody put a stop to these awful doctors.  They're horrible.  Horrible people.  Anthony, what the hell were you thinking?  Well, Bill?  All right.  We should send the homeless drunk dudes.  Does he tape live?  No.  He's...  That would have been great.  He does his O'Reilly character every night. 
[01:03:00]  This one, though, is a special.  This is a special.  Usually he's just on the Fox News Network.  This one is going over Fox.  Fox.  We must bury these youths now.  Do you see their camp?  Do you see how they are spreading like a disease, people?  They are spreading laughter. 
[01:03:30]  They are spreading fun.  And they are powerful.  Down with the old beam.  And I'm feeling...  Unbelievable.  We'll see what happens tonight.  We'll see what happens.  Because I know when we went into it and he was asking us questions, our basic take on  the whole thing is that this is entertainment.  Dude, you got to...  That's what this show is.  It's friggin' entertainment.  I remember we left going, hey, we did all right in there.  But then we're thinking, wait.  Well, they have the scissors.  They have the scissors.  And they only need three minutes. 
[01:04:00]  That's respect.  They have the scissors, though.  They could edit any way they please.  But it's an entertainment show.  Everyone knows that.  And I don't think we have any responsibility to do anything else but entertain people that  listen to this program.  That's their respect.  Frank has a question.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to know, did you guys make any comments like Rick, like, you listen for  20 minutes.  If we're not that funny, you're listening to the wrong station.  No, and yeah, right after I said, get this, 2020 downtown, we do the interview, we're 
[01:04:30]  sitting there.  We have it, actually.  They ask us about the show.  Yeah, grab the clip.  I won't even explain it.  No, explain, because we don't know what part we got.  They ask us about the show, and I'm explaining what it takes when we take the show live to  a new market or whatever, what it takes to really get this program.  I said, basically, it's like kind of a soap opera.  You know, it takes a little time to get to know the characters and get close to it.  And Rick just, the next cliff is Rick directly contradicting what I just said. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Well, this is what Ann said.  Yeah.  We're the worst when it comes to these things, I swear.  It's a show you can't just tune in on day one and really get a hang of it.  It's like a soap opera.  You know, after a week, you're like, all right, I know what's going on now.  I kind of got a gist of it.  And it kind of sucks you in.  All right.  There you go.  Kind of takes a while.  And here's the next clip that he interviewed, Rick.  When you say Opie and Anthony show, everybody thinks sex, sex, sex. 
[01:05:30]  No.  Listen to the show.  And if you're not laughing within the first 20 minutes, then maybe you've got the wrong  station.  I don't know.  A direct contradiction.  Brewer, that aired.  The second you heard me say that last thing, that's when Rick kicked in with what he said.  The complete opposite.  Complete opposite.  You know, they're at the, where was that one?  Fox News?  No.  Was it?  I think that was 2020.  Well, no.  You're either with us or against us. 
[01:06:00]  You know, they're sitting there at Fox News going, oh, my God.  The other guy said something totally different.  The other guy said something completely different.  He said the same thing.  The opposite thing.  Opposite, complete opposite thing.  How are these guys popular?  They don't have a clue.  They don't even talk to each other.  They don't even know what the show is.  Did Anthony even speak to Rick?  Ever about the show?  It's like, yeah, yeah, it takes a while.  You've got to learn to know everyone, all the characters on the show. 
[01:06:30]  If you ain't laughing in 20 minutes, goodbye.  Okay, so I should learn to know everyone in 20 minutes?  What?  Yeah.  What?  Wait, what?  All right.  Well, that's tonight, Ant.  Ah, we're so looking forward to it.  We make fools of ourselves again tonight.  Look for these two morons, Opie and Anthony, on TV, on Fox tonight. 
[01:07:00]  Bill O'Reilly, what is it, 9 o'clock?  Yeah.  Have fun.  Brewer?  Yeah.  Are you promoting anything?  No.  Network.  Network, bro.  Yeah, peace.  Network.  Network.  Take your shirts off.  Show us what you got, man.  Come on.  Next thing you know, we'll be raking leaves.  Why are you on up?  Come on, Rocky's just a kid, all right?  But next time.  All right, let's see.  We're going to go to break here, but before we do, it's a little comedy piece, so don't 
[01:07:30]  dump out of the show in other cities, okay?  Ah, see, sometimes they think we're really going away to some commercials and they cut  away.  Don't cut away.  It's the Jim Norton motivational tapes.  Feeling low?  Well, the best way to not feel like a worthless douchebag is to listen to an even bigger piece  of crap.  I am awful.  With the Jim Norton motivational tapes, you'll feel better about yourself instantly.  I stink.  Hate your body?  Take it from Jim.  I'm a meaty-breasted little nothing. 
[01:08:00]  It could be a lot worse.  This sucks.  Problems at work?  I effed up an ABC audition today.  Hey, at least you have a job.  Everything I do, I look like the Manchurian candidate.  You'll be amazed at how much confidence you have after you listen to a mushy little nothing  tool on himself for hours on end.  Shut up, Jim.  I'm a nut.  Almost 13 years I'm doing comedy.  God, there is no justice in this world.  It sucks.  You have the warmth of a trout.  What a retard I am.  Does anybody not see the disgrace in this?  Everyone loves Jim's inspirational live appearances.  It's a night of pale, meaty-breasted dullness. 
[01:08:30]  Coming to a town near you.  I'm Margaritaville.  I don't sing ever, you idiot.  Stay tuned for details.  Just f***ing listen to the station and get tickets, you douchebags.  Love yourself.  Hate him.  I suck.  With the Jim Norton motivational tapes.  That's me, Jim Norton, folks.  Don't touch that dial, Americans.  See the USA in your chest rollout.  A celebration of freedom. 
[01:09:00]  That's why it's freedom of speech.  It's not freedom to say things except stuff that might offend people.  It's freedom to say horrible things.  Sometimes it's clever and funny and other times it's downright disgusting and offensive.  O.B. and Anthony.  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea.  We're a virus.  Virus.  Virus.  When you call your show, you better know what you're talking about and get on because you're  hard to...  Where is he, Sam? 
[01:09:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  W.N.E.W.  P.O.D.  Boom.  Brewer in the studio.  This is The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Having a lot of fun today.  Yes, we are.  I'm hearing things.  Hearing things.  What are you hearing?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Hearing things.  A little bit.  Might have a special guest today.  We don't know, though, for sure.  You did.  Hearing things.  You said something.  You insulted him.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[01:10:00]  Hearing things.  A little bit.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We're scared.  We're scared.  Keep him here.  Keep him right here.  Ha, ha.  He told me he didn't hurt.  I don't do that no more.  You insulted him.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Na, na, na, na.  On the house.  On the house.  One of the best movies ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  Stephen Lynch is checking in.  He wants to say something to us here.  Lynch, hey.  Did you guys play that goddamn bowling song again today?  Come on.  Well, yeah, why? 
[01:10:30]  You sons of bitches.  Why?  You know, that's replaced FBA as the most shouted out request of my shows now.  Is it really?  I just want to thank you guys for that.  Lynch, you must have been in hell because I was reading email.  Where did you play recently?  I did a couple shows at the Rascals in Jersey and Governors on Long Island.  Yeah, people wrote in and said, within 30 seconds, everyone is screaming for the bowling song.  Yep.  And I gave it to him, too.  All 15 verses.  Hey, you know, on a note of poetic justice, apparently there's a fan of your show who works 
[01:11:00]  in advertising, and a couple of his clients are bowling alleys, and he contacted my manager  about using the song, and I thought, if he bought airtime on your show and you had  to hear that frickin' song 15 times a day, that would be awesome.  God damn.  That would be our house.  And if they pay me any money for it, then it'll, you know, raise my net worth to just  over $131 million.  All right, all right. 
[01:11:30]  So I think I'll have topped you both.  So thanks a lot for playing that song, guys.  I just appreciate it.  And I won't be playing it tomorrow at Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Ah, Bananas in Poughkeepsie tomorrow.  And when you don't play there tomorrow night, you don't want the crowd screaming for the bowling  song, right?  No, I don't want them shouting for the bowling song.  That would not be a good thing if you're going to that show tomorrow.  I would be very upset if that happened.  Tomorrow, okay.  Do the bowling song, Steve!  That's exactly what it sounded like. 
[01:12:00]  Take your shirt off and do it!  Why are you doing the effin' bowling song?  All right, anyway.  All right, Steve.  I'll talk to you guys later.  All right, man.  See you have fun tomorrow night.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  God, that is funny.  We should play his other new song that he played the other day.  Which one was that?  About the fat friend.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  We'll play that really fast.  $130 million right there you're looking at.  You're mine if mine.  You look at Opie, you're looking at a lifetime worth of $130 million as per my wife's attorney, 
[01:12:30]  my ex-wife's attorney, Dominic Barber.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Me, on the other hand, look.  Are you looking?  And this is...  It's radio.  This is it.  This is it.  It was reported that I am worth $100 million.  Bling, bling.  Look out, Dick. 
[01:13:00]  Look out.  Watch the shirt.  $100 million.  Yeah, $100 million.  So I learned you push buttons, you get $30 million extra.  And he's $130 million.  So we were trying to figure out what makes that $30 million difference, and it's how he pushes  the buttons.  I thought voices were very important, but it turns out...  Push the buttons.  30 mil.  30 mil.  Push a button.  30 mil.  Because it's a union job over here.  I guess so.  You don't have the union part of the job over there.  Lucky you.  All right, here's Lynch's latest creation. 
[01:13:30]  See, I'm pushing the button.  Yes, 30 mil.  She got a smile, yeah, she got a smile, and she's flashing it right at me.  She got a wink, a wink across the bar, and I know that it's meant to be.  She got a walk, ooh, she's walking over, and I think it could be my day. 
[01:14:00]  She got a friend, ooh, she got a friend, now why's she standing in her way?  It's a big fat friend.  Oh God, there's always one.  Big fat friend.  To wreck my f***ing fun.  Now, baby, baby, baby, if it's boots you want to knock, leave your chubby friend at home because she's gonna block the cat.  Now, I'm afraid of no man, with any I'll contend, but I cannot compete with your big fat friend. 
[01:14:30]  Big fat friend.  So, big fat friend.  Ah, we meet again.  You will not leave her alone.  You roll your eyes, make sarcastic comments while you're sucking on a chicken bone.  But that's okay.  You think you won the battle, but I tend to disagree.  See, I know you and your Achilles heel, and he's sitting next to me. 
[01:15:00]  It's my non-discriminating friend.  So, I found your account.  Non-discriminating friend.  I nail you anyhow.  Yeah, I know he smells like whiskey, and he's had a couple rounds.  With every shot of Jaeger, hey, you lose a couple pounds.  Now, baby, baby, baby, bring the evening to an end.  Just you and me and my pal.  And your big fat friend. 
[01:15:30]  Woo!  Hey, that's all right, man.  Yeah!  Steven Lutz.  Thank you very much.  I like that one.  Yeah.  Oh, brother.  I knew this call was going to read that.  Jake from Philly, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Who the F is that dude with that annoying laugh?  I'm going to scream when I'm going to commit suicide.  Heee!  You sound like a freaking retard, Jack Hoff.  Thank you.  It's annoying laugh.  Oh, my God. 
[01:16:00]  I'm going to hang myself.  This is worse than Don and Mike.  No, it's annoying.  Jesus.  You know what?  His name is...  Eatabullet.com.  Jake.  Jake.  Yo.  His name is Annoying Laugh Anthony.  Oh, my God.  He's...  Annoying Laugh Anthony.  Annoying Laugh Anthony.  Go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, Jack Hoff.  And he just sits there and, like, starts talking during the show.  Not today.  Laughing.  Not today.  You know, I think we've been drugged.  Oh, my God.  I haven't realized that he's been laughing in the background the whole time. 
[01:16:30]  Really?  Suicide with him.  All right.  You wish you were here, bro.  Later, guys.  Eatabullet.com.  All right.  He's rubbing it in.  You wish you were here.  Yeah.  I would...  You're lucky you're here.  Why is it so...  Yeah, I know.  Why is it so cool to be here?  Yeah.  You got Brewer Live.  You, too.  You know, it's cool.  You, too, is here.  You, too, is coming.  When's you, too, coming?  Like a comedy show.  Like I said, a big surprise on the way.  Oh.  See? 
[01:17:00]  There it is.  That was Brewer.  Mr. Donna Summer.  Hello.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, what's up?  Listening to Disco.  Hey, I remember this guy.  This guy used to call up Ozone's show.  Up in Boston, right?  Yeah, I actually switched...  She just got bricked in the head?  ...in the past couple months.  No, this guy...  I'm in love with... 
[01:17:30]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I got the hotline.  Bing!  Yeah.  Hold on.  Remember this guy, Opie.  Hold on, hold on.  When we were working at AAF, and John Ostel in the Ozone was the midday guy up there.  This guy would call him and sing Donna Summer songs.  They'd play the music, and he would sing Donna Summer songs.  Oh, man.  What?  You remember this guy?  Apparently.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony, number one. 
[01:18:00]  Do you still...  Oh, God.  Do you still call John on his morning show at OR?  No, it's too early for me.  Yeah, I take a lot of pills at night, and I don't wake up until late the next day.  Yeah, that sounds it, man.  What time did you get up today?  So you made the switch for BCN over there?  Yeah, I actually like the music that they're playing.  I still call AAF occasionally. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  You should have had him on O'Reilly.  So, uh...  Well, I'm, like, trying to think of a good song by Donna Summer.  Do we have any Donna Summer?  I don't have the music, but I can sing it.  How about Last Dance?  You know that one?  Yes.  All right.  We'll get Last Dance.  Let's see if we can get Last Dance up for you, and you can sing us a little Donna Summer.  That's where?  Donna Summer?  Donna Summer.  Shut up!  Last Dance, Last Dance. 
[01:19:00]  Well, hold on, Mr. Donna Summer.  We don't have that song, do we?  It's hard for the money, no.  I don't.  You got to work hard.  Hey, hold on.  Do you know she works hard for the money?  A little bit.  Is that what this is?  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  All right, hold on.  She works hard for the money.  Well, wait for the music.  Okay.  Can you hear the music?  Yes.  All right.  Wait for the music.  Remember this one? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Woo!  All right.  You almost ready, Mr. Donna Summer?  You know where to come in?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  She works hard for the money.  So hard for it, honey.  She works hard for the money, so you barely treat her right.  She works hard for the money.  So hard for it, honey. 
[01:20:00]  She works hard for the money, so you barely treat her right.  I wonder if he knows now the rest of the song.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  What happened, Mr. Donna Summer?  I don't know.  That was one of her last songs.  A little history with it.  Well, do you have a request?  Which one do you want to sing for us?  We don't have the last dance, do we, huh?  What's the one?  Love to Love You, Baby.  That's a good one. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, God.  The other one is...  Wait.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I love you, baby.  I love you, baby.  I love you, baby.  Hey, when you're laying so close to me, when you're laying so close to me, when you're  breathing with me, when you're laying so close to me, when you're laying so close to me.  He doesn't know the worst.  Hey, Mr. Donna Summer, you don't know that one either.  What do you know?  I'll work on it.  I got to get the CD and practice. 
[01:21:00]  You're Mr. Donna Summer.  You should know some songs in their entirety.  I needed a reminder, and I actually would know of a lot of them.  Dude, do you love just going through life like this every day?  Yeah, I get a little bit bored, but...  Yeah?  Because it just seems like a happy way to go through life, just effed up singing Donna Summer. 
[01:21:30]  It might be some cruel...  He might have, like, four guys, he's in a gang, and they're like, all right, here's  what you're going to do.  Just stand still.  It ain't going to hurt.  What are you guys going to do?  Bang!  I love you guys.  I really miss you.  Well, we're on up there.  We're on every day now.  Well, you know, I missed when you left, and now I got you again.

Well, just stay in touch, and we'll get some more Donna Summer songs, and you'll learn  some more.  Okay.  And occasionally you could call us.  I like this.  Okay.  All right, Donna Summer.  You're the greatest.  You don't run a radio station down in New Orleans, do you? 
[01:22:30]  No.  Okay.  I was just asking.  I was just asking.  I was offered to be on the Rhode Island network.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I had an offer, but I, uh, I did volunteer work, uh, just, uh, at least, uh...  Right.  Well, great, Mr. Donna Summer.  Rick from Philly says it sounds like a karaoke contest at a mental institution.  Hey, we might have to break out on karaoke in a minute. 
[01:23:00]  Ho, ho!  Have you heard Time of, uh...  No.  Wait a minute, the retarded version?  It is the best song ever.  You know something?  I want to hear it.  All right.  Uh, Mr. Donna Summer, we'll talk to you soon, okay?  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Mr. Donna Summer.  You know, I'm being selfish, but I haven't heard this in a while, and it kills me.  I love it.  I listen to every note of this.  Sometimes when we go to a recorded thing or something, I leave. 
[01:23:30]  I have to listen to every note of this song.  Retarded people at one of those, uh...  I guess they took a bunch of retarded people to an amusement park where you could make your own record.  You ever see that?  Make your own music video.  Yeah.  Yep, yep.  And, uh...  I think it's redundant to say that they're retarded, because everybody that makes one of those looks retarded.  You've got to be a retard to want to do that.  And before we play it, though, Mr. Pat Benatar checking in.  Oh.  Mr. Pat Benatar.  Hi, guys. 
[01:24:00]  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, I want equal time.  If Mr. Donna Summer can get on, then, you know, you need to talk to me also.  Not fair.  Mr. Pat Benatar, what songs do you know from Pat Benatar?  Um, good question.  I don't know.  Do you know...  Uh, let's see.  Hit me with your best shot.  Do you know, uh...  Hell is for Children.  Love is a Battlefield.  Oh, God.  Yeah, something like that.  Uh, Heartbreaker. 
[01:24:30]  I think you're noticing the Heat of the Night.  This one sucks.  You know this one?  Hit me with your best shot?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll let you listen and sing along.  Mr. Pat Benatar on your music station.  He'll be at Anthony Shaw.  Go ahead.  You're real tough to me with a long history.  A freaking little hush like the one of me.  That's okay.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:25:00]  Okay.  All right.  Let him get to the chorus.  Hit me with your best shot.  Okay.  Hit me with your best shot.  Sounds like he needs more pills.  Yeah.  The other guy had all those pills, and it seemed to make sense with the guy with the pills.  The other guy had confidence, too.  Right.  You were lacking confidence.  It was like, ah.  I'll have to work on it.  I'll call you guys back next week.  All right.  You have your game day voice on.  All right, Ant.  Here's your song.  Yeah, this is, uh, so two of these, uh, retarded, a girl and a guy went into the booth

[02:20:30]  Pricks to the wall  You know what I mean  It's kind of like  You know what's crazy  That's exactly what I mean  It's part of history  It is  And the Warner Brothers  Cartoons were very well done  Very clever  Very funny  Adult oriented  It was  It was  They were fun cartoons  And for kids  You watch them  They also  In 19  I think  In the 80's  Sometime  They decided  That they weren't going to show  Any smoking  Drinking  Or guns  In any of the cartoons  In the Warner Brothers cartoons  And most of the fun things 
[02:21:00]  Involved smoking  Drinking  And guns  In those cartoons  You  You screw  You rabbit  Always had guns  That made me want to go  And shoot people  Yeah yeah  You know it didn't  I don't think  It affected us  In a bad way  Made us a violent society  Because  You know  Remember how pissed  Yosemite Sam got  When Bugs kept blowing out  His one match  He brought back from the ship  Oh you darn rabbit  Now I gotta go get another match  And he'd hop across the rocks 
[02:21:30]  And even as a kid  You made you think  You go  One  And he'd take a couple  Of matches with him  Oh  And the shark  Would try to hit him  Down  Down  You hammer headed halibut  You fin flap and flounder  Shovel nose mackerel  He'd get all pissed  Oh  Ah  Coconut soup  Coconut salad  Coconut steak  Oh  I hate coconuts  And then he got Bugs  You know  Bugs was there  Sailing along  That blue light bay  And then he grabbed them  He threw them in the pot 
[02:22:00]  And tried to cook them  But Bugs always outwitted them  It was nice  Good clean fun  And then wabbit season  Duck season  Yeah  Where it would always turn out  Somehow Daffy got his head  Blown off with a double barrel shotgun  Yeah  Classic  Cartoon and it's classic  And came back again  Which basically tells you  What?  Reincarnation  See what big is  You got queen man  Big yes big yes  Big yes big yes  Big yes  I want big  I want big yes big yes  That's an awful big ass  That's an awful big nose 
[02:22:30]  For you  Kaz  Yeah yeah big nose  Come on come on come on  What big is  You got grandma  I brought you  Bunny rabbit  Kaz  Wow  Remember that one  Oh good clean fun  And no wolves dressing up in granny clothes and eating from people. 
[02:23:00]  Stop it.  People are screwing dogs in San Francisco.  But, you know, Daffy would, what would he do?  He'd take his bill and go, and put it back.  Everything was fine.  He'd get shot in the head again.  It was fun stuff.  I remember it fondly growing up.  And I don't think it makes people run into schools and shoot people.  It got me through a half hour where I thought I was going to kill myself when I was nine.  There you go.  Give me a break.  It distracted me from my own death. 
[02:23:30]  And now to watch him edit it, it's a horrible, horrible thing.  Hey, John, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, man?  Hey.  You know, there's one classic Bugs Bunny that I remember when I was younger,  that if they had a Warner Brothers request line, I would definitely request it.  Bugs Bunny goes down across the Mason-Dixon line, right?  Yeah.  With Yosemite Sam?  Yeah.  He's always trying to, you know, outweigh the Yosemite view or whatever.  And there's this one part where he comes dressed as, like, this brown bunny with overalls playing the banjo. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  He dresses up as Abraham Lincoln and, like, throws a whip in his hand.  And he starts running around going, well, don't whip me, master.  Oh, man.  He was doing a traditional old blackface minstrel show.  And they don't do it anymore.  Well, no.  And it's a damn shame.  Because regardless of how offensive it is, it's so funny as hell.  It was funny.  I look at these things now, though, as being a part of history.  And it's kind of like you're trying to put, sweep things under the rug.  There was a mindset when these things came out. 
[02:24:30]  Right.  You know, a lot of the ones that came out in the 40s were really anti-Japanese and German.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I mean, they had the big, oh, he's ready to try to hit me with frying pan.  With the big teeth and the big glasses and the big glasses.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All you see was, oh, he's ready to try to auto-witter.  Your pan will never work.  And, like, Hitler, he's smacking Hitler in the face.  There's cartoons.  Swastikas in them. 
[02:25:00]  Hey.  You go, why not?  Good, clean fun.  You're not going to do that today.  No.  But it was a mindset of the time.  I think it's history, and I think you should just embrace it, understand it for what it  is, and not try to hide it.  Yeah.  You know, just.  Those people should just get baked and hang out in the backyard, man.  On the roof.  Cartoon.  Hang out on the roof.  On the roof of the little faggy playhouse.  Get baked.  Swat some clouds.  Bring them right around.  Bring your kid up there.  Look, there's a marshmallow.  All right.  Oh, my.  We got to break in because we're losing time on the show, and we got seven dust. 
[02:25:30]  Great.  Yeah.  Who stole my modulator?  Bring them in real fast and say hi.  No, no, no.  Why not?  Why not?  Are they sound checking?  Sound checking.  Look at Ben, panicking.  Huge.  My uranium Q-38 space modulator.  I didn't like him.  I was scared of him as a kid.  The little Martian with the brush on his head?  Yeah, he scared me.  Bugs always nailed him, too.  No, there was one where Bugs almost didn't make it.  Is that why he blew up the moon?  He was hanging there at the end?  Yeah.  Here we go.  Yeah, where he's going down.  He's like, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah, 
[02:26:00]  with the Gremlin when he's in the airplane?  They probably don't sell that one either.  That was the World War II one.  Yeah, he hopped in a bomber.  Yeah.  And the Gremlin made it take off.  Yeah.  And Bugs was just...  Bugs was the Gremlin's bitch the entire episode.  Yeah.  You're used to seeing Bugs kicking ass.  Yeah, that's why I didn't like it.  He turned flat and kind of fainted down the stairs in the seat.  Yeah.  It was creepy that one.  I didn't like that as a kid either because, yeah, Bugs was kind of getting his ass kicked 
[02:26:30]  and Bugs always won.  Which obviously were things took a turn for you two.  It was.  But you know something?  I felt better at the end when he didn't crash and he just stepped out all cool, calm,  and collected.  Right, but it was weird.  I didn't understand it.  I ran out of gas.  You know how it is with these A cards.  Yeah.  And we got a brain.  Remember that?  That's an L bit.  Just ended.  We should have done this earlier.  We could have went for an hour.  But never too soon.  All right, listen. 
[02:27:00]  When we get back, Seven Dust is going to perform for us.  Nice.  Cool.  How cool is that?  We all think I'm having a show.  You're all burning in hell, damn you.  What about the bucket of AIDS in the face?  You guys are a pest.  All right.  Who wants a bang and a wagged out fat broad?  You're such a disease.  Shut up.  I'll cave your head in with our frigging spade shuffle.  Yeah, the show's going bad fast.  Nothing says hot like a PZ-otomy.  That was O&A quality stuff.  Opie and Anthony.  And the choir tastes like roadkill. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got a full house.  Jim Brewer in the studio today.  Louis Black from the Comedy Central thing, the Daily Show.  Sorry to Louis.  From the Comedy Central on the Daily Show.  Yeah, I know.  I'm taking one from Iron Sheik there.  And in studio, Ant.  Seven Dust.  Yeah, Seven Dust.  Soft.  Soft.  Soft.  Oh, my God.  I love it, though.  It was Brewer impressions.  It was Brewer impressions.  Brewer's.  I've got to watch, dude. 
[02:28:00]  What?  What's wrong?  I'm excited.  Look, Brewer, I've never seen you as a fan.  It's very strange.  Those are huge, man.  They're huge.  Look at you, man.  He's all giddy.  I am.  I have to say, it was where Paul Bond was, I was driving on the road.  And he's playing.  I'm not going to lie to you.  At first, I was fighting my wife and stuff.  And I'm listening to, like, Sting.  Hanging out.  Sting?  Oh.  Fighting with the wife music?  Yeah, exactly.  You know, man.  I'm right on Weaver. 
[02:28:30]  And you got that stuff.  Well, you got to put Sting on just to keep yourselves together.  He's jamming.  Listen, you put on the wrong tune, you're just getting a divorce.  You got to put on the music we used to listen to.  Paul Bond turned me on to these guys.  And then we were in Denver, and I was like, they're in town.  I was playing close by.  I can't say enough, man.  Man, we didn't know you were going to be here.  And when we came in and saw you, it was like, oh, this is all good.  We love your work, man.  We love your work.  L.J. got real excited.  He's like, oh, the smoke one. 
[02:29:00]  Just for old time's sake.  Well, that could be arranged.  Eat dust later.  That'll be arranged.  Who's got one?  You guys did, what'd you do, Letterman?  Yeah.  How did that go?  Yeah, what's that all about?  It was cold, man.  It was freezing in that play.  That's what everyone says.  We'll never know.  He was there.  He was a Hesterner.  Whatever, not Hesterner.  What am I talking about?  He basically arrested it.  And, yeah, it was cool.  It's crazy, man.  Did he say hi?  Do you know him?  Yeah, he talked to us.  L.J. tried to steal his shoes. 
[02:29:30]  Man, he had on these pimp shoes.  And he was like, oh, Mr. Masato.  And you call him up, I'm like, I don't have a million dollars to buy.  You always want to say the Mork and Mindy thing, man.  I know.  I was like, always, man.  Orson calling Orson.  I knew, now I knew.  Like, I heard.  I knew, now I knew.  You know he just hates that, too.  You know he just.  No, he's like, oh, I knew.  That's good.  Now I knew.  That's the best word.  Y'all know what?  All those movies, they're all basically compiled in that phrase, man. 
[02:30:00]  It's awesome.  But check this out.  Paul Schaefer actually played with us tonight.  He did the stream.  Oh, he did?  That was an experience.  I think he enjoys when the bands let him play with us.  He's real cool.  Because sometimes they're just like, no, Paul, you sit this one out, man.  Yeah, we don't need you.  I want to have some fun with these guys.  He's really nice.  He's got to help out over here.  I could just go like ding, ding, ding, ding, anything.  Just so I want him.  And the man of triangle.  You're like a bird noise.  And the man of triangle.  That's great. 
[02:30:30]  And then Robin Williams, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't know.  A lot of people find him funny.  I just think he's working off the same.  I think he said one funny thing a few years back, and everyone kind of remembers it.  I don't know.  I just don't.  Because it's always like, now he just can get up on stage and go, oh, look, I'm wearing a shirt.  And everyone goes, oh, look.  That sounded exactly like it.  And everyone goes, oh, that's a star guy.  Why am I laughing?  What?  It's just a shirt.  You know, and then I raise my zipper up, and everything goes away.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Like butters?  What butters? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Wait, what?  What?  I'm laughing, but I don't really know why.  Oh, laugh, please.  Seven dust.  How about six dust?  Oh.  And then you're like, what?  And everyone laughs, and it's like, why?  Why are you laughing?  I don't know.  I'll see.  Maybe tonight.  We'll see you tonight with Seven Dust on Letterman.  Maybe it's better.  You guys get in trouble in New York or what?  Not yet.  You haven't found trouble yet?  We just, this is our, no, not yet.  Like it's like, shut up, man.  Shut up.  This is the part of the tour we finally have days off.  All I know is they said, Opie and Anthony want you in. 
[02:31:30]  And I went, oh boy.  Yeah.  We all got to talk to you guys.  You guys are pounding down cold beers in here, man.  I mean, it's like, yeah.  It's a false festival.  Stinky.  What the sticky, sticky, sticky, icky, icky, icky.  This is called being in a very good situation at a suck-ass station.  You know what?  When you're doing very well at a sucky station, we could shoot heroin and tie off, and sometimes  we do. 
[02:32:00]  And there's nothing they can do about it.  So drink up.  Have fun.  Yeah.  We're drinking with Sam Adams.  Could be over next week.  Who knows?  Sam Adams.  Enjoy it while it's here.  God damn it.  That's how I am about my new house.  I bought a house, and I don't have any money, so I figured, you know.  Oh, jeez.  Right?  So I figured I'll just live in it for two or three weeks and enjoy myself.  It's like getting a good hotel room for a while, you know.  Exactly.  Look at all the rooms.  Man, my episode of Cribs would be like three minutes. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  Cool.  That's it.  Get out of here.  God, I wish I could remember the guy.  I just saw an episode of Cribs.  I can't remember who it was.  He had a really great backyard with a pool.  It was almost like a, looked like a jungle.  Okay.  Thank you.  He's rolling.  But you know what?  The yard looked great.  The pool looked great.  But then he's inside, and it looked like, all right, I've been at this house, you know.  It wasn't like one of those, like, Tommy Lee's frigging Tommy Land.  Puss up, dog.  This is my dog, dog. 
[02:33:00]  You see now.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, man.  You're the man, Bo.  Why you got to dog it up?  Girls, girls, girls.  Girls, girls, girls.  That's all I got to say.  Doct to feel good.  That's what everyone loves.  Doct to feel good.  Doct to feel good.  Doct to feel good.  Doct to feel good, sweet home.  Look at that.  Exactly.  Doct to feel good.  That's home sweet.  That is so funny, man.  But it's like, that's one of those houses.  All you faggots are going, sell out.  You know I'm a believer.  But my heart's a good.  Get run away. 
[02:33:30]  That's a house.  The Blink-8-182 was like, all right, you know, he could have used some, like, paneling  on a wall.  It was kind of like, but then he goes, this is where I spent all my time.  It's my backyard.  And, you know, again, it wasn't like time.  It's because I wasn't a kid in the pool.  All right, stop it.  Enough.  With that, we've got to get seven.  Hey, wasn't a kid in the pool.  We've got to get seven of us playing it.  We're running out of time.  Cool.  We're running out of show.  You guys are going to play some stuff from Animosity or what? 
[02:34:00]  We're going to play Stairway to Heaven today.  We're just figuring out how to play it.  Yo, dog.  Little sweet home Alabama.  This is my dog.  Dog.  We're going to play Angel of Death by Slayer.  It's going to be great.  It's funny, though, man.  It's like he tongue-twisted himself over the dog thing.  It was like, so I shook out my Coy's dog and my Lake back here dog.  And, oh, there's my dog over there.  Dog?  Dog.  All right.  You're one groovy baby. 
[02:34:30]  I was crushed over it.  Baby.  Baby.  Baby.  I preserved normal.  He's going to beat my ass, too, because I think we're playing with him in Iowa somewhere.  As long as he doesn't beat it with that man meat of his.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a deadly weapon.  That'll hurt you.  Good God, man.  What a package.  That's a beeper dude.  All right.  Let's go outside and check out 7-Dust.  Nice.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  We'll wait until everyone goes, because it'll just be dead air if we're walking all at the  same time. 
[02:35:00]  Well, I've got to get the slug line in, though.  Transportation for 7-Dust provided by...  Oh, no.  Is that why he's here?  Annoying laugh, Anthony.  Come on.  I was wondering what the hell he was doing here all day.  Top-notch limousine, 516-756-1663.  You know what else?  He didn't bring any champagne or anything.  So that's why, because he had done something that he was going to get a plug for.  And we've got to get out there.  We only have eight minutes.  I'm out.  And we want to try to get a couple out.  Be nice. 
[02:35:30]  Whenever you're ready.  I'm not going to stand...  First of all, I don't want to stand out there and listen if I can't hear it the way it's  going to sound on the air.  Because I know you stand out there and you just hear acoustic guitar and no vocals.  I want to hear it.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm out here.  All right.  I got the best seat in the house, man.  7-Dust.  I want headphones out there so I can hear it, though.  Well, just get your ass out here.  Brewer's going to be gravely disappointed that he's not going to hear it the way they're  hearing it on the air.  Well, Brewer could hang in the studio and we could crank the monitors in there. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  All right.  7-Dust.  They're going to be on Letterman tonight.  The new CD's called Animosity.  It rocks.  Here's Anthony.  Everyone is drunk out here.  There's like 100 people outside the studio.  No one knows what the hell's going on.  I still don't have headphones.  All right.  Well, let's just shut up and listen to 7-Dust, okay?  Brewer, you need headphones, man.  Brewer's a big fan.  There are stars in the 7-Dust. 
[02:36:30]  God!  God!  God! </pre>
