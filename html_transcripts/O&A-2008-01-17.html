<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the film *Cloverfield*, featuring in-studio guests Jim Norton and Patrice O'Neal.  The group debated the film's shaky camera work (which caused O'Neal motion sickness), plot points, and the realism of the looting scenes. O'Neal's disruptive and comedic commentary during a prior viewing was a key part of the conversation, punctuated by jokes and observations about the film's inconsistencies.  This was followed by scheduled calls with Sylvester Stallone and Andrew Morton, bookended by a lengthy segment focused on radio personality Bob Grant being denied a Lifetime Achievement Award. The hosts and Norton strongly opposed this decision, citing Grant's long career despite his controversial past statements, sharing anecdotes about his on-air persona and interactions with callers.  They also briefly touched upon Eddie Murphy's divorce and Ike Turner's death, and reviewed an American Idol contestant, Kyle, and humorously discussed Sanjaya Malakar's previous season appearance.

A phone interview with Bob Grant himself followed, centered on the award controversy. Grant discussed the pressure broadcasters face from special interest groups, drawing harsh comparisons to Al Sharpton's tactics. He also addressed the evolving standards of acceptable speech in media and the potential chilling effect on free speech.  This transitioned into a heated and vulgar studio debate with O'Neal, the hosts, and callers about race relations in America, the use of racial slurs, and perceived hypocrisy in how racial issues are addressed. O'Neal argued that a new wave of white people facing repercussions for racist behavior was a recent phenomenon and that white people often avoid open discussions about racism due to fear and guilt, while black people feel freer to express controversial views.  The conversation frequently used offensive racial slurs and revolved around racial stereotypes and tensions. The hosts also impersonated Bob Grant. A technical difficulty caused a significant broadcast disruption, interrupting a planned interview with Sylvester Stallone.

Stallone eventually called in to promote *Rambo*, discussing his career, his physical preparation for the *Rambo* films (aiming for a "working class, hard man" look), the challenges of filming *Rambo: First Blood Part II* in Burma (including employing Burmese refugees), and his regret over *Copland* negatively impacting his career. He compared his career trajectory to Robert De Niro's, highlighting his less versatile path defined by *Rocky*. He mentioned turning down roles in films like *Coming Home*, *Witness*, and *Romancing the Stone*, and shared a humorous anecdote about the empty seats in *Rocky*'s boxing match scenes due to budget constraints. He also briefly discussed his relationship with Carl Weathers.

Following Stallone, Andrew Morton, author of a Tom Cruise biography, joined the show in studio. The discussion centered on his book, the challenges of interviewing people involved with Scientology, and controversial aspects of Scientology and Cruise's life, including its secretive nature, beliefs (like the "wall of fire" and body thetans), and the potential for lawsuits. Morton addressed rumors about Cruise's sexuality, stating Cruise has denied being gay under oath.  The hosts and Morton engaged in several humorous exchanges. The show concluded with a discussion of the upcoming election and its racial implications.  Throughout the broadcast, numerous callers added their perspectives to the various debates.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to your socks?  I don't know what happened.  Oh my god. Oh my god.  He's doing it now. His skin is completely black.  Oh my god.  This is where entertainment is going.  Oh my god.  Oh, Roland's got a paddle.  Oh, my God, Roland is kicking Dave's ass. 
[00:01:00]  Who saw this coming?  They are sick freaks.  One, two, three, go.  B-Rock is attempting.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get it on.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:01:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Starring Jim Norton.  No one else.  Just starring Jim Norton.  For five hours, it's just me.  Yeah, and featuring Patrice O'Neill.  How's that?  I say starring everyone.  I say feature star. 
[00:02:00]  I don't like the pressure.  I understand that.  That's why we did that.  I don't like it.  Starring Jim Norton.  Featuring Patrice O'Neill.  Featuring.  I need you to say action for me to talk.  And guest star Gavin.  How's that?  That's how...  Guest star featuring...  No.  I say starring, featuring, with special guest star Eric and an appearance by Gavin.  Yeah, an appearance by Gavin.  I like Gavin to talk as much as he wants.  I don't like the guest starring role. 
[00:02:30]  It's just going to hurt Iraq.  We'll have to deal with it for the rest of the year.  Guest star.  Featuring.  I don't know if I like featuring.  Featuring.  Does that mean I get my own...  On the credits, do I get my own name?  Is my name by myself or I'm with three other names?  Yeah, you'll be part of the credits.  You're not supposed to like the featuring thing.  It was supposed to just bother you.  Featuring.  But I don't know if guest star means never coming back.  Also. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, you're also starring.  No, just also.  Also.  Some of those old shows just had...  How about O-N?  The ad at the end is okay.  The last one.  And Patrice O'Neal as himself.  Ooh.  Very good.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  I guess we got to get right into it and do the break we did in the lobby of the movie theater  after we saw Cloverfield.  Now, Jimmy and I went and saw Cloverfield with the rest of the gang. 
[00:03:30]  And I liked it.  Jimmy liked it.  Most of the staff liked it.  I had a problem with the shaky camera work.  And it got me sick.  I had a motion sickness thing.  Which means you didn't like it.  You can't watch a movie that physically makes you ill and say you like it.  That's like saying I like what it could have been.  Well, I had to like...  I didn't tell you this in the lobby, but it was getting so bad that I had to actually close  my eyes and I would listen to the dialogue.  I'm like, okay, all right, someone's bleeding and they're just talking it out a little bit. 
[00:04:00]  All right, back to the monsters.  Now I got to open my eyes again.  I had to decide when to watch the movie because the motion sickness was getting to me so bad.  And then I'm thinking, oh, I can't be alone in this.  So after the movie, I ask every single person, did the shaky camera work bother you?  I was the only one.  Then it was affected a little bit.  It didn't bother me at all.  I get motion sick bad.  I love the movie.  Yeah.  You couldn't have loved it.  I really did.  You're just trying to be alternative.  You're hanging out with Janine Garofalo and them.  No, no, no.  I'm intimidated by their comedy.  But I did like the movie. 
[00:04:30]  I was kind of bummed that nobody else did.  I was surprised.  Well, that's not true.  Jimmy thinks he was the only one.  Well, you, I don't like it, but I didn't think the rest of the crew enjoyed it.  No, E-Rock loved it.  Than liked it.  Travis liked it.  Than loved it.  They loved it.  Yeah, Rotten Tomatoes in general likes it so far.  The reviews that are coming in for this movie that starts tomorrow, by the way, Cloverfield.  68% positive reviews.  But Patrice is just not fun at a movie theater.  He makes everybody uncomfortable. 
[00:05:00]  They did a screening for 12 of us, and we were uncomfortable, and we knew 10 of the people  in the theater.  Right?  Patrice is like your drunk date at a party.  You're like, just don't, don't tell him.  Because I can hear him.  I was like five rows behind Patrice, and I could just hear him.  I knew it was critical.  The movie, there was no one more excited to go to this thing.  Well, you like monster movies, right?  I love monster movies.  Yeah.  I love monster movies, but this particular, I don't know what you call it in the genre. 
[00:05:30]  It's just an exercise in yuppie heroes.  You know what it was about this movie?  It, too much, what do you call it, suspension of disbelief.  Too much.  Too many things that made me go, ah, this, it was, you know what I, what this movie was?  It was the middle of a monster movie as the whole movie.  It was, it was no, it was no, okay, uh, guys dropping, uh, you know, the guys taking a dump 
[00:06:00]  in the lake and tuna turn into a giant porpoise or giant monster.  Right, right.  There was no oil.  There was no evil corporation thing.  And I know dumb, uh, Danny was saying how it was a Chinese, this, this, and that.  But it was no explanation.  I wanted that movie to be a movie.  You want it to be a Hollywood movie.  Cloverfield's trying to do something a little different.  This is very, very different than most, than every monster movie that came before it. 
[00:06:30]  I just, it just, the, the, the longness of the party, the buildup trying to get you  to care about these people was ridiculous.  See, I didn't think it was that, well, only because when you look at like a lot of movies,  they take, look how long Kong took with buildup.  I mean, and he got, Peter Jackson got criticized for a three hour movie, but you didn't see  Kong for the first hour.  As you should have.  Like you, like, see, I enjoyed, I, what I enjoyed about it was the possibilities of the 
[00:07:00]  movie, the possibilities, but the entire movie in this, and another thing, that fat, that  meathead that was carrying the camera, he was, they was trying to do it in like some weird  Blair Witch style.  Yeah, the whole movie is what's on a camcorder.  I want to make that perfectly clear so people understand, and they're at a, they're at a,  they're at a party in the beginning where someone's going away, and you know, just like we all  have done, you're, you walk around with a camera and getting people talking and saying  nonsense.  That scene went on forever, and you knew it was going to lead to. 
[00:07:30]  Can we systematically go, like, each step in this other way?  Yeah, I just don't want to give away the movie to the people that are going to see it  tomorrow, but sure.  Let me know if I'm giving it away.  Okay, but the guy who's filming the movie.  Yes, no good.  Okay?  The guy who's filming the movie goes from, oh gosh sucks, I don't know if I should be  touching this camera.  Right.  To, uh, you know, super Asian tourist, like, he goes from, oh gee whiz, I don't know if 
[00:08:00]  I know how to even work the thing, into, I am going to, uh, film this attack.  In zoom.  In, for prosperity.  Yeah.  Where, if you even go to, if you go to 9-11, no one keeps a camera on the, on the situation  for more than 30 seconds, cause you're like, I got to free my hands up to run as fast as  my two ball fists will do this.  Right.  Will do the run move. 
[00:08:30]  This guy is.  Basically, I don't have time to film, film this thing.  Nobody has time.  Right.  To film the movie.  And he is right, cause all of a sudden he would, this kid, this guy was handed the camera  at the party, like, here, could you just, you know, film some stuff?  So, so he remembers, you know, his friends and stuff and the going away party when he's  in Japan.  I think he was gone.  Then we get to 9-11.  The 9-11 meets OJ meets Watts Riots meets Godzilla bothered me to no end.  Really?  It bothered me.  A couple of scenes. 
[00:09:00]  To no end.  Like, like, like what?  The building falling down the, uh, in the background and then the, the, the, the, the,  after full, the smoke coming down the street.  We, we've seen that footage a million times.  The only difference, this was in the dark instead of in the daytime.  But it's almost like, that's a tough thing, cause if a movie's gonna make a monster movie  in New York, you're gonna have that.  Right.  You know what I mean?  You can't win with that one, man.  It did.  Spider-Man took the, you can, you can win with it.  Not with big buildings falling down.  But don't knock them down.  Why?  It's a monster.  Don't knock them down.  Talk to the monster. 
[00:09:30]  And no, and no more sexual harassment of the Statue of Liberty.  It, it just don't make, it just, the movie, okay, if it didn't try to also make, make  points, it was trying to also be something other than what it was, which was, okay, it  was quite, the thing is, it was quite spectacular in terms of the way the camera was doing what  it was doing.  They didn't have to cheat as much as you'd think to accomplish what they accomplished.  Right.  It was too much stuff that made, it was making me sick. 
[00:10:00]  It was like, and not the movement, just the, oh, give me, did, are they looting where  the giant creature is smashing buildings?  What are you trying to say?  That really bothered you.  About the evil of New York.  At least they, they threw a few white guys in there looting for you.  Right, exactly.  Talking about trispection and disbelief.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Which is, which is what bothered me.  Patrice saw the looting scene, and I was sitting relatively close to Patrice, and he  was, he was bothered, like, there we go, this is what we do, and, and disasters, but 
[00:10:30]  then I noticed they, they sprinkled a few white guys in there.  Of course, just to make it like, we're all crazy.  Right.  It was so purposely done.  Why didn't he, this guy with the camera, take a train up to Harlem and film him looting  as the monsters attacking Manhattan?  Do you understand?  It was, what it was, was this.  It was trying to give you that documentary feel, but it was filming scenes.  He was filming scenes as if it was a regular movie. 
[00:11:00]  So here's the monster right on top of his face, and he goes to film his dumb friend and  his two girlfriends over in the corner hiding when Mr. Creature is right there.  You don't move the camera or you throw the camera and run.  Is it possible that he was moving the camera, some of the stuff they did where he would  just kind of move the camera the way you would move it without regards to what it caught,  and of course, because it's a movie, they have you catch what you need to see. 
[00:11:30]  But I mean, there are certain things that it was a little, like.  So make it a movie.  But I kind of, you have to cheat a little bit.  Where's the scientist that goes, my God, you don't know what you're dealing with.  Where's the general that goes, we have to plan on, it should have been Godfielder.  Because that movie's been done a million times.  They were just trying to do something different.  You got to understand that much.  I understand, look, I get the thing they were trying to do.  Right, right.  I want monster movies.  The way they did it, I think it could have made it, it could have been good if they had 
[00:12:00]  did it just like a movie.  See, they got a lot of stuff across in this weird, like they showed to me, they showed  the panic.  We just said there's a scene on a bridge, which is, I talked the other day, I just said  something really bad happens on a bridge.  And the way the camera is shaking, and it spun around when he runs in the direction, it's  like, that's what it would look like if you were videotaping.  Some kind of crazy disaster.  And people videotape everything now.  Yeah.  They videotape everything.  There was a guy inside the towers on 9-11, and he videotaped, like the guys who were making  that documentary, people would lose. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Maybe they were just doing that because they don't know how you'd react if a monster walked  through, so they're trying to make it realistic.  Yeah.  But I mean, you know what I mean?  How would you act if a monster just was strolling through New York?  I'd be sitting on a pile of logs.  You would not do, that suspension of disbelief.  You would just hide in a basement.  It just was too much.  Hey, all right, listen.  Oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  If you said to people at one point, like after a tremendous flood, where people were stuck  in the Superdome and dying, people would be looting.  You know, before Katrina, you would have said, that's crazy. 
[00:13:00]  Nobody would loot during that.  People loot during every daily riots.  Anytime there's like a thing where there's a mass movement of people, there are people  that are going to loot.  It's almost like they don't believe what is happening around them, so they'll go in there  and loot.  I mean, that's-  And what did you love about the movie?  I don't know why.  The fact that it was different, the fact that I thought that it happened, it felt like  that's probably the way, as much as you could feel the way a real monster would feel coming  in, that's how it would feel.  Like there's a shock, the lights go out a little bit, nobody knows what's going on.  I like the way they filmed the television to give you certain news reports. 
[00:13:30]  I like the way they gave you like a top angle, because there was no way for them to show  you a top angle of this monster and this mayhem.  Oh no, there was a way, there was a way.  I'm making it a movie.  Yeah.  But I mean, I kind of like the fact that they stuck with this.  They stuck with the concept all the way to the end.  Yeah, and I really, I like the fact that he showed them just arguing outside.  And let me go help this broad that I slept with one day ago.  Well, that's the-  They're best friends, they're good friends.  Yeah, one of the, let me get to the-  She's dead.  They're good friends.  No, no, she, she's dead. 
[00:14:00]  You wouldn't have went back for her?  Look, I'm not even saying it, trying to be Mr. Evil, she's dead.  But they needed a reason for them to go from downtown to midtown, and the reason was a  little lame.  Yeah.  I mean, they were friends for a while, and they slept together once, and he needed to  save her, and it was like-  He left his lucky lamb chop bone, would have been as good as a thing to go do, as save her.  Hey, I gotta jump in here and get a couple other things out, because we don't want to spend  too much more time on this, because we have a busy show ahead of us, but Patrice just  making comments to the screen, the entire movie, and then Jeffrey Lyons was in there. 
[00:14:30]  He's a very, very famous movie reviewer, and all of a sudden, what, the credits roll,  and what'd you say?  Half a star.  Half a star.  And old funky Jeffrey goes, oh, what did he say?  No one asked you.  No one asked you.  And then he marches out to take his popcorn dump.  I wonder what he gave it.  Do you know what he gave it?  It hasn't come out yet.  It'll be interesting, because we saw the movie with this guy, so, but you go, boo, one star, 
[00:15:00]  half a star.  If my mind was working, I would have said, Jeffrey, I have the same job as you right now.  Shut up.  Like, I'm just as good as you right now.  Ben?  The other choice Patrice comment was, obviously, it's a monster movie.  The camera takes quite a beating, and I guess Patrice didn't buy that the camera would survive  some of the horrific stuff.  And just, you know, something terrible happens to the group, and you just hear Patrice go,  must be a Sony. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, it must be.  It had to be a Sony.  Boy, what battery life.  Really?  You got attacked by parasites?  No, we figured out the battery thing.  Jimmy nailed it yesterday.  The battery, what you were watching, and again, we're not giving the whole movie away, what  you're watching is what's on a videotape.  Right.  The movie is an hour, an hour and a half long, so you're watching an hour and a half of what's  on a videotape.  So when it looked like there was a moment where they're downtown, and all of a sudden  they run up to 59th Street, and it looks like there's five movie minutes have passed, you're  watching what's on a videotape.  So obviously he turned the camera off a lot, as the way people would. 
[00:16:00]  You don't see him turning the camera on and off, because when you're watching a videotape,  you don't physically see the guy turning the camera on and off.  You were seeing the results of an hour and a half on a videotape.  Right, right.  That's what was interesting, because the scenes would just jump, and you're like, whoa, why  would it jump like that?  Well, the reason, because the guy, yes, stopped the filming.  I like the fact that the things Patrice finds unbelievable are the battery life, but not  that there was a monster in New York.  But that's what I'm saying.  That's why I said it was the middle.  It's like if they filmed King Kong, if they started on the island and then ended when he 
[00:16:30]  got gassed.  Yeah.  All right, listen, we're heading toward our first break, but the first review in the New  York paper came out.  I want to make it clear that so far, Rotten Tomatoes likes this movie, 68% positive reviews  as far as the reviews coming in.  And we're going to have Jay Abrams on the show, I think, tomorrow.  When's the cast in?  No, Jay Day's next week.  Oh, next week?  Oh, the cast might be coming in tomorrow.  So this guy, Lou Luminick, writes, Cloverfield combines unpleasantness and stupidity to a 
[00:17:00]  degree that would be difficult to match unless you were stuck in bed with a case of the  shingles while being forced to watch the Ghost Whisperer.  At least the guy's funny.  Yeah, that's...  As the Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla meets the Banana Republic catalog, I'm not  sure who suffered more, the characters or me.  I was forced to write down page after page of dialogue.  I had a problem with some of the dialogue myself.  Like this, and then he gives examples of the dialogue.  What the hell was that? 
[00:17:30]  Oh, God, this is nasty.  This is like a nightmare, you know?  After the monster tries to drag one of the screamers away...  Hold on one second, I'm sorry.  Did he prefer it when Will Smith was jumping around going, hey, it's raining black folks  in Men in Black...  Is that the type of monster movie dialogue he wants?  I don't think that's a fair comparison, though.  No, but I'm saying like the cornball, not even Will Smith, or the cornball stuff that  they said in Independence Day...  But there was no cornball moments in the movie.  In what?  In that movie.  There was not one place where a cornball moment should have been happening. 
[00:18:00]  In what, this monster movie?  In Cloverfield.  Oh, yeah, no, no, but I'm saying like, but he's like looking at the dialogue like that.  You don't know how people are really going to react.  At least the dialogue, I think, was attempting to react.  This is a visceral makes me sick.  That's what this review is.  This is visceral.  After the monster tries to drag one of the screamers away, we get, what's up with that?  Someone who's bleeding from the eyeballs has asked, are you okay?  And she's bleeding from the eyeballs.  And one who has nearly been ripped apart alive in the last part of the movie, whatever. 
[00:18:30]  However, you're saying, this is the dialogue, you're saying this isn't attractive looking?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, she was...  And you and your camera theory, it was a whole, half of the movie was down under, in the train station,  and they were just talking.  And that was a moment of turn the camera off.  Oh, yeah, probably right.  Okay, but again, there's certain things they had to cheat just to make it, like they had to a little bit.  I know. 
[00:19:00]  You know, that's...  I know.  I just wanted this to be better.  And they bring up the Patrice thing that you mentioned.  Why does everyone risk their lives going to a friend's place to rescue her when they have no reason to believe she's still there?  That's...  The guy did have reason to believe she was still there because he heard a message from her in the...  Cell phone.  Yeah.  On the cell phone.  And the bottom line is...  And that she was stuck in her apartment or something.  The fact that they slept together...  Would you save your girlfriend under those circumstances?  Be honest.  I don't think I would save her if it was...  I can't think of a more strife example. 
[00:19:30]  Like, no.  I'm selfish.  But this wasn't even if it was raining Frisbees.  This wasn't even a girlfriend.  Absolutely.  I'd put a little bandana around her neck and say, go catch one of your teeth.  I'm hiding.  That part...  This wasn't even a girlfriend, though.  I couldn't overlook.  I couldn't overlook.  They were friends and then they were starting to fall in love.  There was desperation to save this girl who not only brought another dude to a party, he had called a dirt... 
[00:20:00]  It's just...  His need to save her in this situation just...  It was too many times to go, F this.  He loved her, though.  I don't even remember, like, they showed them when the guy's walking around the party going, so-and-so slept with her.  No one could believe it because they were such good friends for a long time.  And then the camera, which I like, they show briefly the argument in the hallway where the guy goes...  You hear them arguing.  She's like, you never called me.  Like, he heard her.  He had sex with her.  They were really close.  They had sex.  And then he never called her again. 
[00:20:30]  So she showed up with this guy at the party and then he insults them walking out going, hey, good luck to you.  And he regretted saying that to this girl that he loves.  I've seen the movie.  I understand the love.  But there's not even...  Like, I love my mother.  And I'm almost thinking...  I'm almost thinking I'd just do the cross, the Mexican cross over my heart to say, ma, I hope my mother makes it.  I don't know if I did.  They fought lice or whatever was falling off the thing.  They fought the...  And...  I got it. 
[00:21:00]  Real fast.  How many monsters were there?  I don't know.  They don't necessarily...  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  They don't give us much.  There's probably another movie coming.  They might not tell you a lot of stuff.  Just like you wouldn't know.  I know what they could do now.  They could now make a real movie.  Think about that.  To explain everything.  I hope JJ's listening to you.  I'm going to tell them to make another movie when we talk to them.  I liked it.  I hope they do it the same way, but with a bunch of different videotapes.  I liked it.  I really liked it, man.  There you go.  I'm going to ask you about this one part.  Maybe they find more videotapes. 
[00:21:30]  They set it up that there could definitely be another movie if this does well.  Cloverfield.  It opens tomorrow.  Very busy show.  We've got Patrice O'Neill in studio today.  Bob Grant calling in at 7 o'clock.  There's something just outrageous happened to this guy.  He's a radio legend.  He was supposed to get a Lifetime Achievement Award.  And R&R, it's Radio Records, they decide not to give him the Lifetime Achievement Award  after saying he was getting one.  And there's a lot of rumblings that it might have something to do with Reverend Al. 
[00:22:00]  You know, Bob Grant has been accused over the years in his career of being racist.  He has said some crazy things over the years, but that's whatever.  It's just disgusting.  Right.  Disgusting that they took this award back.  So we're going to talk to him at 7 o'clock.  That should be very, very interesting because he doesn't hold back whatsoever.  We also have Sylvester Stallone calling in around 8 o'clock today,  which is a huge coup for the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course, Rambo coming out soon.  And Andrew Morton, who wrote the book on Tom Cruise, 
[00:22:30]  he's going to be stopping by to talk about that book.  So we're very, very busy today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Moving on to other things.  Jimmy sent out an email yesterday to everybody.  He's pretty much outraged about Bob Grant.  I don't know if the rest of America knows Bob Grant.  I mean, he is huge in the radio world.  Bob Grant was a real conservative. 
[00:23:00]  He was the first talk radio I really listened to.  On ABC in New York, he was an afternoon guy,  and they would replay him late at night  because they didn't really have a late, late night guy.  So I'd drive to gigs, and me and Otto would listen to Bob Grant on the way home,  and he made me laugh harder than any comedy show I've ever listened to.  Bob was a brutal guy.  In a good way, though.  He just spoke his mind.  He didn't pull punches.  He was politically incorrect.  And that got him fired eventually from Disney here in New York 
[00:23:30]  when Ron Brown's plane went down.  I think Bob Grant said something to the effect like,  well, they say that he died, but then again, I'm an optimist.  And I'm paraphrasing you, but it was something like that.  Right, basically hinting that he was very happy that this guy died in a plane crash.  Yeah.  He was known to say a bunch of racist things in his radio career.  He still does radio, by the way.  Yes, he does on WOR.  And, you know.  Is it ABC again?  Oh, good.  Yeah, they brought him back.  And if he didn't like a caller, like let's say an old lady didn't agree with Bob Grant, 
[00:24:00]  he would basically tell her that he's going to knock her teeth out, and he meant it.  That was the beauty of him.  It wasn't like he was trying to be shocking.  The stuff he said, he meant.  He meant.  So Radio Records, it's one of these trade rags.  You know, it's a very popular trade rag.  I don't really acknowledge them.  I think they're a bunch of pompous a-holes.  But they're giving Bob Grant a Lifetime Achievement Award,  and they're doing their huge R&R convention where they get together and they kiss each other's ass. 
[00:24:30]  Everybody in radio, not everybody in radio, and I have never gone to one of these things,  but they all get together and just smooch each other's you-know-whats and drink and get prostitutes and drugs  and, you know, and make believe that they're working.  You should have made it look like a less fun event.  Well, true.  Oh, it's terrible.  They're just drinking at hookers and overeating on drink.  Good point.  I just described a very fun party.  Yeah, I know.  And so he was supposed to get the Lifetime Achievement Award, 
[00:25:00]  and at the last minute they decided that they looked at his body of work  and they don't want to give it to him after all.  So the whole radio world pretty much is outraged.  Yeah, because I guess if they're going to yank awards due to political feelings  or being even racist or racially,  I bet they better yank Ty Cobb out of the Hall of Fame  or they better do it to a million other people who have had, like, other opinions  that a lot of people wouldn't like.  The guy is a radio legend.  Whether you agree with him or not, whether you like him or not, 
[00:25:30]  he absolutely deserved the award,  and it's sickening that they decided not to give it.  And R&R is insisting that it's about his body of work  after they looked at it a second time.  But here's a little interesting tidbit about the whole thing.  The convention is going to have Reverend Al on the panel  and doing his thing,  and people are starting to think that,  well, people might have started emailing R&R going,  how could you give a Lifetime Achievement Award  to someone that, quote, could possibly be a racist?  So all these years of racism, 
[00:26:00]  he never had a nappy-headed comment there?  No.  No, not really.  I mean, that Ron Brown comment got him fired,  which it shouldn't have.  I mean, it was an impolite thing to say.  What did he say about Ron Brown?  Well, after Ron Brown's plane crashed,  Bob Grant said something.  Oh, right.  Yeah, and they fired him for it.  I hate firestorms when people say something that isn't nice.  I'm not even going to say shouldn't say.  Who cares if he said it?  Right.  You don't like him, don't listen.  So it's a respect the dead thing.  I never knew how long you had before you didn't have to respect the dead anymore.  I mean, in the old days of radio, whatever. 
[00:26:30]  Anything goes as long as you follow the FCC regulations.  But we live in a new world where you can say something stupid  and you can get fired.  It's ridiculous.  So Bob Grant's coming on around 7 o'clock,  and I'm sure he's not going to be shy about the whole thing.  That's for sure.  Yeah, I'm a big Bob Grant fan, and I think it's just embarrassing.  We met him when we were working at Joshua.  John Minnelli brought him through the hallways of N.E.W. back in the day,  and we pretty much left our radio show just to get a picture with him  and shake his hand and meet the guy. 
[00:27:00]  That's how important he is in radio, to me anyway.  I've never heard of his radio.  He's an older guy, and I remember he said to a guy one time,  and some gay guy called in.  It's amazing what would go through over the airwaves,  even like this is probably 10 years ago.  And the guy was saying that he wanted to do things to Bob,  sexual things.  The guy started talking, and he's like,  I want to do this to you, Bob.  And Bob hung up, and he goes,  you know, by this time next week,  I hope you have a full-blown case of the virus.  Next caller, you're on, A.B.'s.  I love him. 
[00:27:30]  He was unapologetic.  He would never wink and giggle at his own stuff.  He just plowed.  Bob was great, man.  Yeah, he was crotchety.  Bob was great.  When he was cranky, there was times where you just knew  he wasn't feeling good.  So what happened to him?  ABC fired him, and then he went to,  he eventually got another job at OR.  And how famous is this guy?  As far as New York radio goes, he's huge.  He's a legend?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Bob Grant?  Way up there.  Way up there.  I'm not sure if he ever got syndicated.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe he did.  By the way, he is 8 to 10 p.m. on 77 ABC, 
[00:28:00]  so good for reading those guys.  And good for a lot of the radio guys out there,  you know, sticking up for Bob Grant.  And not just people that work with him at ABC.  Other shows are jumping on this as well,  which is kind of cool to see.  All right.  In other news, Eddie Murphy and his wife split  after two weeks of marriage.  Oh, my God.  What is that about?  Wow.  What are we going to find out about that?  She wasn't funny.  She wasn't funny?  Yeah, she just wasn't funny. 
[00:28:30]  She never swallowed.  She didn't laugh.  She didn't like trading places.  Why would they make him homeless?  Oh, Patrice.  Can I say Patrice's Def Jam set?  God damn it.  You're a bit on how women are so literal and annoying  and, like, you can't have fun with them  by, like, speculating.  Hypothetically challenged.  Like, what was the example you used?  Like, you could just walk up to a guy  and go, hey, would you sleep with a bitch  without a nose?  And it was how men would debate it back and forth 
[00:29:00]  and the women would be like,  you can't breathe if you don't have a nose.  You can't live without a nose.  I'll take you to the nose doctor to get a nose.  I was reading a book about noses  and it said you can't live without a nose.  Just awful, awful conversation.  And it all stems from, how come you don't?  They'll hear me and you on the phone talking about it, 
[00:29:30]  you know, and she'll, you know,  your girl listens to the conversation  you and your boy have  and then she'll go,  how come you don't talk to me  like you talk to your friends?  I'm cool like them.  I'm fun like them.  All right, so would you sleep with a guy  if he didn't have a nose?  What?  That's just you.  And then Transformers is like,  a car turning into a robot?  That's stupid.  Where's the wheel?  Where's the wheels  when he turns into a robot  and then they come back out out of nowhere?  Where's the windshield wipers? 
[00:30:00]  This is stupid.  Is that on demand?  On HBO?  I think so.  I think it's not.  Some people can check that out.  Yeah, absolutely.  So you got Eddie Murphy  splitting after two weeks of marriage.  There's speculation, but you know.  He's still too King Kong-ish to be speculating.  I don't know who the hell knows  why Eddie did that.  Yeah, you want to work with Eddie someday.  Or at least keep that possibility open, right?  Well, I would like to work with J.J. Abrams. 
[00:30:30]  But I blew that one.  You sure did.  I don't want Charlie looking for me.  Where's the Murphy story?  I'm sure I have it somewhere.  They decide after two weeks  that they're better off being friends.  Wait a minute, Ken.  Now, let me ask you a question, Ken.  I don't know who knows about divorce,  but he got divorced from this other lady,  his baby's mama's, you know.  But I'm wondering if the guy gets married,  can he stop giving his money to his ex-wife?  I don't think so.  No, no.  Only if she gets married. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, she's got to remarry and then all bets are off.  Oh, he doesn't get off.  He gets married.  No, no, no, no.  So, I don't know.  Also coming out today, this morning, I should say,  Ike Turner died of the cocaine.  That's speculation.  Don't just say that.  That's not speculation.  That is the coroner's report, Jeff.  It might be stuff left over from 1970 when he last beat Tina.  He could be the oldest guy that's still doing coke.  I don't know.  How old was he?  76, and he died of a cocaine overdose. 
[00:31:30]  God bless him.  I love Ike.  God bless Ike.  He was still punching 18-year-olds.  I love him even more now.  76, cocaine overdose.  That's got to be a record.  The best scene in What's Love Got To Do With It is after she records with Phil Spector,  Tina Turner's an amazing song called River Deep Mountain High,  which Phil Spector has set up an orchestra for.  Really, it's a beautiful song, but she did it without Ike Turner.  And when he heard that, he knew she didn't need him.  I think Ike understood, like, I'm the weak link here, or I'm the softer of the two,  whatever he understood. 
[00:32:00]  And he's like, damn, anime, that was a good song,  and you just know she's going to catch a black eye for it.  You knew by his praising it that he was really bothered,  and that she was going to catch a good fist in the face.  And that is, you just know, sometimes you go,  you believe in that karma if you want,  but he did coke and beat women until he died of old age.  Right.  I mean, a very fair age of 77.  I would be so proud to live to 77.  That's an extremely fair age if you're doing cocaine. 
[00:32:30]  And I just saw him.  That's like, in regular years, that's got to be like 120.  Yeah, he just slipped to 120.  And what?  No, that's long, because if you do the white people, black people years,  I'm 120.  77-year-old black man that does coke, he's a 196-year-old white man.  That's right.  At least.  That's right.  He's at least 196 years old.  Now, should he not be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? 
[00:33:00]  Because he was a rock pioneer.  I mean, Ike Turner.  Don't try to push it to your boy, Bob.  No, no, I'm saying, of course he should be.  Of course he should be.  All right.  Without a doubt, he should be.  I mean, he could do it with any rock singer, all the things they do.  So why would it be any different for a radio guy?  I mean, Ike was wonderful.  I love Ike.  I told you, I was with a prostitute one time, and she was doing things to me.  And this is the truth.  Can you tell us, talk and code, what kind of things, Jimmy?  All.  All right.  Don't kiss her. 
[00:33:30]  That's boring in your world.  Don't kiss her.  That's boring in your world.  I thought we were going to get on something a little better than that.  That's all she was doing.  If she burps.  Wait, no.  No.  Hey.  No air leaks.  What?  No, no.  I don't know.  No, it's fine.  It's all right.  Just stay right there.  You're fine.  I wasn't going.  See that stop sign?  Stop.  I don't want to say what she was doing.  Jimmy always freaking does mouthwash at this part in the show. 
[00:34:00]  The funniest thing was this.  Picture a girl doing this.  Just picture this.  Picture a girl, because I'll never forget, I'm in a hotel, and the TV wasn't working too  well, and there's an Ike Turner interview on TV.  And the girl was doing what she was doing, and then her eyes were diverted to the right.  And I'm like, this bitch is watching an Ike Turner interview, and he's there going,  I never hit my wife.  And she's like, and I had to turn it off.  I'm like, this is distracting me.  But it was annoying me. 
[00:34:30]  More interested than your peel baked potatoes.  Watching an Ike Turner interview.  That was a beautiful one.  You should have watched it, too.  I know I should have.  But I was losing tenacity quickly, and she was on the clock.  I don't think she would have sat there and watched the interview, and then finished up  when Ike was done talking.  A price of not comeback.  Yeah.  Well, we got Patrice in today, which is perfect for this next story.  This story just hit the wire there.  Hold on a second.  As it cues up, I want to play some. 
[00:35:00]  Let my people go.  Let my people go.  From American Idol, the other night?  Yeah.  I heard the ratings were down for that dumb show.  Yeah.  That's still really strong.  But what?  Lowest rated premiere in four years.  Let my people go.  You'll be singing that later.  That's my job today.  Let my people go.  You'll be imitating that sometime today.  Anyway.  Well, they said 33.4 million people saw it, but it's like everyone's DVRing, and no one 
[00:35:30]  watches stuff live, or a lot of people don't watch it live anymore, especially in the beginning  when there's no one getting eliminated, so who cares?  It's the same old crap.  Yeah.  I used to love that show, but now it's like it's the same stuff, and they're kind of  getting the Carrie Underwood looking person, and they're getting the rock guy, and they're  getting the chick that might be gay, might not be, and then it's just...  I was too angry.  I was angry at myself last year for how much I was into it, and I'm...  Well, because you were falling in love with... 
[00:36:00]  Sanjaya.  Sanjaya.  Oh, yeah.  Sanjaya, that delicious piece of thing there.  Yes.  And I just...  Remember, we had a lot of discussions about that.  You got angry because of the feelings you had toward that.  He just was...  Because I've met...  I've met...  Yeah.  I've met a...  It's angered for trees.  He's a bloke.  Yeah, but there's some dudes that are so gay that if you like them as a straight man,  you're not gay. 
[00:36:30]  Equilibrium.  Yeah, he's just...  Remember you said that when criticizing your old pal.  He's a girl.  But a lot of those dudes are dudes still.  Oh, don't be so fresh.  Oh, God.  It's just he was so effeminate.  He just...  There was like...  There was just a little X chromosome that he missed.  You would have not only hit it, but you would have done, like, the pointer and middle finger  on the cheek afterwards, like the gentle, like...  You know what I would have did with him?  I'll tell you what I would have did with him.  If I was a pimp, I would have put Sanjaya out there.  Like, I would have put him out there because I would know how much money he could make. 
[00:37:00]  He can make you very rich.  Oh, man.  If I was a pimp, yeah.  As a pimp, you'd be a bottom bitch?  No, no.  You can't have a dude bottom bitch.  But for the other dudes...  I don't know if he wanted to get other dudes, but for him, he was such a girl that you  got to...  You know, you put him out there and you would make a lot of money.  Was he wearing all the makeup and all the dress?  Just these delicious hairdos.  Yeah.  Delicious.  Oh, they just, you know, like, just the perfect thickness.  It was...  Sanjaya was... 
[00:37:30]  And his sister was phenomenal.  Just to put those two out there.  She was beautiful.  Oh, him and his sister.  I didn't see her.  Oh!  I never saw her either.  Sanjaya with longer hair, basically.  I want to see him.  And a couple bumps in front.  His sister was...  His sister was...  She had to be a...  I don't even know the back size, but she had to be a 34D natural.  Did she look like him as well?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They looked like they could have been twins.  Anyway. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Well, we meet Kyle.  We're going to give you a little taste of American Idol last night.  This is Kyle.  Black guy?  My name is Kyle Rennick, and I'm going to be the next rock sensation on American Idol.  I'm a pretty hardcore rocker.  I like rockin'.  I'm a pretty hardcore rocker.  It's like rockin' back and forth on your hands and knees with a gentleman's hands.  Of course you do.  You're rockin' because you want it to hurt.  He likes bob and roll. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, God.  I'm pretty hardcore rocker.  Can't say that.  I like rockin'.  The look kind of speaks for itself, you know?  The shirt says, Do You Idol Kyle?  And I got all my fans here signing.  The eyeliner, or guy-liner, as I should say, kind of adds to the rockin' out.  When I get into my performances, I'm pretty edgy.  I haven't seen myself rock out, but I've heard that I'm pretty intense.  All right.  He's intense.  He's a rocker.  He's pretty edgy. 
[00:39:00]  What do you think he sounds like?  It's going to be.  Pretty well.  He sounds pretty wild.  I can't think of anything odd about his voice.  Oh, I'm sure.  Oh, watch that.  He's pretty good.  I'm sure that's a tribute to Bondi.  Sorry, nothing.  All right.  So tell me about yourself, man.  What are you going to sing, man?  Kelly Clarkson, Never Again.  Of course.  After saying he's edgy, he's out there, he's a rocker, he's going to sing a Kelly Clarkson  song.  All right.  So tell me about yourself, man.  What are you going to sing, man? 
[00:39:30]  Kelly Clarkson, Never Again.  All right.  Cool.  I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well.  Could you tell by the flames that burned away?  I never read your letter, because I knew what you said.  Give me that sonny's cool answer and try to make it all okay.  Doesn't hurt to know I'll never be there, but it sucks. 
[00:40:00]  I've seen my face everywhere.  It was you who chose to end it like you did.  I was the last to know you knew exactly what you would do.  That should come with AZT pills.  It should.  Sounds like Allison John.  Who?  Allison John.  Who's that?  Oh, Allison John.  I thought you said Allison John.  I heard Allison John, too.  Allison John.  Allison John.  Allison John. 
[00:40:30]  Allison John.  And there'll be another dude that makes a million dollars from sucking.  Nah.  Not first week out.  Nah.  You've got to be booted a little bit later.  Yeah, obviously he's booted, and he's not a rocker.  He just sucks.  But did you guys notice on Idol, it's so weird that sometimes some of those singers, they're  so terrible.  It's like, what are they showing them on TV for?  But you know Simon's going to get them.  Simon's fresh.  Whoa, unpredictable this show is.  Yeah, whoa.  What's up?  What's up?  Look out.  Oh, I hope Simon doesn't see that. 
[00:41:00]  Dope.  Wow, they didn't know ahead of time.  That's a little weird.  Yeah, had they not screened this more carefully, Simon's really going to go nuts.  Give him to Simon some fodder, it looks like.  Whoa.  God, could Simon be with two bigger boars, too?  Could they get a, I mean, of all the black guys, how about Paul Mooney?  How nice would that be?  Right.  Or just somebody who really hates white people.  Yeah, but it works.  I mean, this freaking show is huge.  I love your old bit on American Idol, and Simon, and how Simon beats up these kids that 
[00:41:30]  have this dream, and just destroys what they look like, what they sound like, their personalities,  everything about them.  And Jimmy used to do a bit about how, you know, you would love to see Simon do that in front  of young rap guys that are trying to make it.  I haven't done the bit in years, so I actually like him now.  It was something about his cowardice and how he wouldn't talk to, like, you know, Def Jam.  What was Suge's label?  I don't remember the bit.  Death Row.  Thanks, Death Row.  Yeah, like, say the same crap to these young, you know, wrap-up stars. 
[00:42:00]  He would never do that.  But you know what?  I think people turned around, turned as far as Simon goes, because he's showing the other  side of him, finally.  That, you know, he's kind of...  What's the other side?  He's got, like, that little heart beating in his chest.  I don't mind that he's a freak.  He shows that part now.  Yeah, now he can after 17 years of $10 million a day.  So now he can come out and it doesn't even matter.  Well, this show's big in England, too, right?  Like, he's got an idol in England.  He's got another one.  Yeah, he's got it all over the world.  He's got the old thing to start.  And wait, you know what else is his? 
[00:42:30]  The Invention Show is his.  Yep.  And the other idol for anybody on NBC.  Oh, America's Got Talent?  That's his, too.  X-Factor.  We call it X-Factor back home.  Same program.  Oh, America's Got Talent?  Yeah, anything goes.  Is it good?  I don't really watch them myself, personally, but it's massive back home.  It's humongous, man.  It's massive back home.  He's big business back home, as well.  Yeah, he's got something with Sharon O'Don.  You think he's a billionaire?  Gotta be.  He's got to be way up there.  I like him, man.  I like him. 
[00:43:00]  He's a big home.  I like him.  Hey, we're heading toward another break here.  The great Bob Grant at 7 o'clock.  Yeah.  Very happy.  Right after the commercials, we're going to talk to Bob Grant.  It should be interesting if he speaks his mind.  I think he will.  Yeah.  All right.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Bob Grant standing by.  You want to explain before we go to him?  Bob Grant, for those of you that don't live in the New York area, I'm sure you know him 
[00:43:30]  all over the country.  He's a radio legend here in New York.  And he's said a lot of things that bothered a lot of people, which in this country is not  really allowed anymore, unless, of course, you're attacking from a certain political  ideology that it's acceptable and free thinking.  But if you're attacking from Grant's point of view, it was considered racist and inappropriate.  So whatever.  He was fired from ABC.  He came back.  And he's supposed to get a Lifetime Achievement Award, which he deserved.  And R&R backed off on it.  That's right.  Due to just being cowards and pressure. 
[00:44:00]  And this is what R&R printed up, I think, yesterday.  Award withdrawn.  Upon further review and consideration of Bob Grant's complete body of work, Radio and  Records has withdrawn its decision to present the 2008 News Talk Sports Lifetime Industry  Achievement Award to Mr. Grant.  R&R is sensitive to the diversity of our community and does not want the presentation of an award to  Mr. Grant to imply our endorsement of past comments by him that contradict our values  and the respect we have for all members of our community. 
[00:44:30]  Holy F!  You know, reading that, it makes my jaw move to the other side.  It's so despicable and such smarmy, just apologetic, liberal crap.  It is.  Let's just talk to Bob.  It's just disgusting.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, the great Bob Grant.  Bob.  Ah, good morning, gentlemen.  How are you, Bob?  You sound like Anthony.  That's how Anthony does you. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, Bob, we're completely outraged that this is happening to you.  When did they tell you that they were not going to give you the Lifetime Achievement Award?  Yesterday, a little bit before noontime, I got a phone call from a young lady who was not the young lady who had originally called me to tell me R&R had selected me and asked me to be the recipient.  It was somebody else.  It was somebody else. 
[00:45:30]  She was very nervous.  She identified herself as Cindy.  And it was painful to hear how nervous she was.  And she finally got to the point.  And she said, well, we are going to rescind our invitation to you.  And naturally, I asked why.  And she said, well, upon reviewing the body of your work, you could tell she was reading it.  And I said, well, you mean to say you didn't do any research on me before you decided to give me the award? 
[00:46:00]  She was completely, completely at a loss when I asked her that question.  Yeah.  Well, Bob, let me ask you, when you heard about this, I mean, you know who you are and you know your successes in radio.  Were you, like, really honored to get this or was it just more aggravating when they took it?  No, actually, when they told me that they would like me to be the recipient, I said to Heather Cohen, who was the woman who called originally, I said, are you serious, really? 
[00:46:30]  I said, well, you know, I'm honored.  And I was.  I'm not going to be, you know, be phony here and say, no, I wasn't honored at all.  I thought it was fine.  And guess what, guys?  I've been in this business for so long, and I've been a pathfinder for a lot of people, including you, too. 
[00:47:00]  And I think I do deserve something like that.  But this isn't going to ruin my life.  But what it does do, I hope, is destroy R&R.  I mean, there are too many people that say, ooh, R&R, ooh, R&R, and yet I'm getting calls from individuals who claim they're going to boycott the affair at the Renaissance Hotel in Washington, D.C. on March 13th.  And that's a biggie, because that's a big party every year.  I mean, you've got the hookers, you've got the drugs, you've got the alcohol, you've got the ass-kissing going on. 
[00:47:30]  So to boycott that, that's tough for a lot of radio guys to do.  Well, they said they're going to do it, but between now and then, who knows?  Yeah.  You had to have learned, as you guys might have learned, that at the beginning, when the shock first hits, you've got a lot of friends, and then suddenly they peel off.  They fade away.  Oh, they scatter like cockroaches, don't they, Bob?  Don't they? 
[00:48:00]  You find out who your real friends are.  Well, that's it, the real friends.  Now, I think this goes, and guys, I'm not being political here at all, but I think this goes beyond me.  It goes beyond you.  It goes beyond any individual.  What does it say about the state of America today?  Well, it's just, it's very typical of what's been going on.  I mean, it used to be that, you know, if you said unpopular things or politically incorrect things or what went against the grain, it was considered kind of free thinking. 
[00:48:30]  But now it just seems where it's switched, and the people that fought for that, which was the left, have become the most restrictive.  And, look, you had a brilliant quote.  It hurts me, but I think it also hurts everybody, because this is, is this what America has become?  Is this Salem in 1692, where someone accuses you of being a witch and you're presumed guilty?  That pretty much is it.  They got a few complaints about honoring you, and they rescinded it because they're cowards.  Is that what happened, Bob?  A lot of people started emailing from maybe some special interest groups? 
[00:49:00]  Or a couple of people.  One guy.  One guy.  One guy.  I'm not even going to mention his name, but it's been identified.  As a matter of fact, he's bragging about it.  And the reason I'm not mentioning his name is that's precisely what he wants.  But this is a guy who has been stalking me for, oh, at least 20 years.  And his whole life is an obsession with me.  Well, how did one guy get this done, then? 
[00:49:30]  You got some more people behind him?  Or...  The lacklessness of corporations, people in general.  What?  That's all you have to do is point the finger.  Now, I said to someone from the Washington Times who called for an interview, she said,  well, what about some of these charges?  I said, what charges?  Well, that you're a racist.  I said, what is a racist?  Would you please tell me?  And if you can tell me what a racist is, would you please identify a few? 
[00:50:00]  And leave me out for a moment.  I won't have my feelings hurt.  And she couldn't do that.  And then I asked her if she knew of anything I had said.  And when was it?  And she went back to April 3rd, 1996.  I said, oh, something in 1996.  And I said, even if I said something that was illegal, wouldn't the statute of limitations apply here? 
[00:50:30]  And she said, well, you did say that about Ron Brown.  I said, what did I say about Ron Brown?  Do you regret...  Your intent is to entertain.  Yep.  And you like to get laughs.  And if you didn't like to get laughs, you wouldn't be as good as you are.  But I like to get laughs, too.  And I thought it was a little humorous what I said about being, you know, the famous quote, 
[00:51:00]  which was really one of the most innocuous things I've said.  Yeah, you probably said a lot worse than no one picked up on, right?  Yeah, right.  That's usually the case.  Like, they point to what I'm...  ...later or so.  Well...  And suddenly, it's like I just said it yesterday.  Right.  It is amazing how Jesse Jackson is forgiven or other people are forgiven for these things  they say that are politically, you know, incorrect or vicious because time has passed and if you 
[00:51:30]  dredge up their past, you're seen as not letting go and letting people move on.  And yet, you know, a white guy that made a remark like that, it's very safe for them to continue attacking 12 years later.  And just...  This guy, whoever it is that's stalking you, is probably a liberal guy and it probably...  It's the bane of his existence that he just cannot reach you and make you speak the way he wants you to speak  and think the way he wants you to think.  And it's really sad that R&R just buckled and...  Why?  ...and is listening to this one guy and, you know, that... 
[00:52:00]  I don't know...  I just don't understand why R&R is doing the same thing that special interest groups are attempting to do to radio.  Have you been attacking this on your show, Bob?  You're on...  Bob's on ABC.  What are you on?  Every...  It's 8 to 10.  Is it Monday through Friday?  Well, sadly, I'm not going to be on tonight because there's...  I think they're carrying a hockey game or...  Well, that's some great programming.  If I'm the program director of ABC, I get rid of the hockey game because everybody wants to hear Bob Grant tonight.  What were you saying, Bob? 
[00:52:30]  I want to acknowledge that some of my colleagues over there that were brilliant yesterday, Sean Hannity and Mark Levin.  I mean, they really gave it to R&R and I was listening and I was very proud of them.  Hey, can I tell you what I used to love that you would do on ABC?  Because they used to carry the Yankee games and a lot of times that would cut into Bob's show.  And I was a Yankee fan and he would never mention the Yankees.  It would be so...  Like, he'd be in the middle of his show and he'd go, well, we have to go because the Milwaukee Brewers have a baseball game tonight. 
[00:53:00]  Which I always thought was so funny the way you would just slap the Yankees and they would interfere with your show.  Yeah, but...  Well, you see, you're very perceptive because some people never knew what I was up to.  They thought, oh, we now carry the Brewer games?  You always made me laugh.  And it's like, how could people not see the humor in just the brutal honesty, the unapologetic honesty of the things you would say?  I don't see how anybody, whether they agreed with you or not, could not just love listening to that. 
[00:53:30]  Well, you know, if you tuned in and everything was agreement, agreement, agreement, I don't think you'd maintain your audience.  No, not at all.  What do you think...  I'm sorry.  Well, I mean, Bob Grant said something very interesting earlier.  I just want to go back to it for a second.  That, you know, all we're trying to do with these radio shows is to entertain people and we don't have a script.  And every once in a while, you're going to mess up.  And that's not okay anymore in this day and age.  Remember the days, Bob, all you had to worry about was the FCC regulations? 
[00:54:00]  That's all.  But now you've got to worry about how powerful some of these special interest groups are.  And you've got to watch every single word you say.  And that makes for a tough position for all of us broadcasters, you know?  I mean, at this point, we're not allowed to touch Asian humor.  Well, that's true.  I mean, you go back to when Don Rickles first burst on the scene.  Everybody was just absolutely captivated by the guy. 
[00:54:30]  He's still one of my all-time favorites.  Absolutely.  But if he were just breaking in now, I wonder what would happen to him.  Well, do you find it disgusting that Sharpton is on the panel, you know, that he's actually on this panel?  Not because Sharpton's on the panel, but because they're rescinding an award to you because of inappropriate things or things that they felt you should be scolded for.  And this guy, who has just been a pig for the last 20 years in the media, is allowed to speak. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, let's look at his body of work.  Why is he allowed to, you know, talk at the convention?  Let's study his body of work.  Well, here's a guy who helped perpetrate the fraud of the Tawana-Brawley case and is still walking around.  As a matter of fact, bigger than ever.  And the question that people are now beginning to ask is something I brought up years ago.  To what office has he been elected to?  Where does he get his power? 
[00:55:30]  Who said he's the arbiter?  White people.  Yeah.  Who said that he is the court of last resort?  Who the heck is he anyway?  White people said it.  I think that maybe he still resents me because many years ago, over at WABC, maybe in 84, 85, somewhere around there,  I had him on the program and he was debating somebody else.  And I was astounded by the jewelry and the big gold watch on his wrist. 
[00:56:00]  And I commented, I said, Al, how can you raise your arm with all that jewelry on it?  And he didn't like that one bit.  Of course not.  But you're right, because he's not been elected and because he doesn't quote unquote have an office, there's no accountability basically to anyone.  Whereas if you work for a radio company, you work for CBS, you work for ABC, that's who you're accountable to. 
[00:56:30]  But I don't know who he's accountable to, which I have no problem with him saying what he wants to say.  But the fact that white people, every time he yells, white people just kind of back up with their hands raised and are apologetic.  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  And they react the way he wants them to react.  It is just kind of sickening and we're just really, really irritated.  Does Reverend Al have anything to do with what happened to you, Bob?  Well, this is a lot of people are speculating.  Aspect of this whole thing. 
[00:57:00]  Because it's not a level playing field, eh, to use that analogy.  I don't know what else to say, though.  But it's not, it's a double standard situation.  If you get into an argument with a political figure on the basis of his politics, and he happens to be a black politician,  then you're going to be accused of racism.  Sooner or later, it's a, ah, he's doing a racist.  But if a guy is a conservative and he happens to be black, he's my guy. 
[00:57:30]  I'm interested in his political philosophy, not the color of his skin.  But there are some people that don't want to believe that, like Jeff.  That's brand new, though.  And Al Sharpton doesn't.  Because they've been making a nice living off of the fear that people like, well, you can name them all,  members of the white race, are terrified with being called a racist by someone like that.  And that it really, in the long run, is hurting everybody. 
[00:58:00]  But they don't get it.  Right.  We got Patrice O'Deal in studio, Bob.  Patrice, what were you trying to say?  How are you, sir?  I'm Almond.  They call us Almond now.  Oh, really?  In the community, yeah.  Sounds nice.  I just wanted to say, though, this brand new white people are getting in trouble for being racist is brand new.  It has to be less than 20 years old.  So it's like, all of a sudden, white people just kind of want a lot of anger to go away. 
[00:58:30]  And we're not having dialogue to get rid of old anger.  It's just that old white guys now feel victimized and they want it all to be some colorless world all of a sudden.  Well, you know, there's a tendency, especially in America, we do tend to go from one extreme to the other.  Now, let's face it, our legacy was of slavery, Jim Crow, certainly a segregation that was very cruel to black people. 
[00:59:00]  Now we're going completely the other way, trying to compensate.  I have nothing to compensate for.  I don't know about you guys, but I was born long after slavery was eliminated, and I did not participate in anything that would keep anybody down on the basis of race.  And I have no guilt whatsoever.  I would have guilt if I didn't stick up for an individual who deserved my support. 
[00:59:30]  Notice, I said individual.  individual, and if we can ever get back to America being the land of the individual, we'll be all right.  But I don't think we're going to get there.  But that, gee, well, go ahead, Patrice.  This is coming from a white guy.  I mean, no offense, I'm just saying it's coming from a white guy.  It's like the land of the individual.  Jim Crow was over yesterday.  Like, I was born in 1969.  Martin Luther King got shot in the face by a cracker in 1968. 
[01:00:00]  All of a sudden, in my lifetime, we have to go back to the land of equality and the land of this wonderful land.  It's because it's becoming hard for white guys.  Now we got to stand up.  Now, I'm the one that stood up for Imus, but it wasn't because Imus Paul White, man.  It was the fact that I make a living talking.  So it's like I stand up for that.  But this thing where the land of the free and how we all need to come back, come back to what? 
[01:00:30]  That's for you, not for me.  Well, you know, I was watching a statement made by Barack Obama, the senator from Illinois.  Of course, we know he's running for president.  And it was a statement which I agreed with 100%.  He was talking about Ronald Reagan.  I think he has decided that it's very smart for a Democrat to praise Ronald Reagan.  And I was thinking about the fact that I haven't heard one person, one person say to me, 
[01:01:00]  gee, I don't know, I couldn't vote for him.  He's black.  Not one.  I have heard some people say, ah, he's too liberal for me.  And that's the basis that we're supposed to base our vote on.  And that is the policy, not what the guy looks like.  But have you heard anybody jumping out of windows because Senator Obama is black? 
[01:01:30]  I haven't.  If he gets elected, we will.  They said it, I did.  Exactly.  That's the whole thing, Norton.  That's what I wanted to say.  Can I enjoy the fact that I just made my Bob Grant laugh?  You know how happy that made me?  But that was his laugh was my eyeballs rolling in the back of my head at, because white people  never, I've never heard a white person on radio, on TV at any point ever say the N-word before, 
[01:02:00]  you know, before, you know, the word that caused the N-word.  Yeah.  Meaning, I've never run into a white guy, I've never run into a white guy that said they  was mad because OJ was a black guy that killed a white woman.  It's always like, I'm upset that a man killed a woman.  It's like, white people never admit to being racist.  That's why it's like, this conversation's null and void.  It's like, we're victims of racism, but you never, the average white guy never admits  to being racist, ever, ever. 
[01:02:30]  It has to be a frothing at the mouth cracker or nothing.  We didn't, we didn't, we didn't say that we didn't like OJ killing Nicole because it  was a black on white thing.  No, you won't admit that the reaction was racial.  White people don't admit it.  Well, because we thought that she made the mistake by being there to begin with.  Right, right, right.  Of course.  Of course.  Well, using your logic, do black guys admit being racist?  No!  Ladies and gentlemen, I've just been handed this bulletin here. 
[01:03:00]  Uh-oh.  Opie and Anthony want to change from being a duet to a trio.  And who is the gentleman who added to the mix would make it a trio?  Patrice on the other.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll just, I'll just go back into the corner, sir.  Lord and Jesus.  Give me that watermelon rhyme so I can wear it as a hat.  I just was talking, sir.  I mean, I'm sorry to interrupt with your buddies while you're sitting here wanting the world  to be the same again. 
[01:03:30]  Sorry about that, Mr. Bob Grandhero to all white guys.  Hold on.  Just tell Bob you're going to come down to the studio later.  While he's not out tonight.  I don't even know what a trio is, sir.  Ain't that a cookie?  It's what leaves grow on.  Yeah.  And it's like, you don't even, you don't know what Bob meant by that.  You might be misinterpreting Bob.  I just, Bob, Bob, do you not like Patrice?  Well.  Exactly.  Yeah, you help out. 
[01:04:00]  I'm glad that you called.  I'm delighted to be with you.  And I do have to get going here.  Okay.  But just keep on keeping on.  All right.  Any final words for R&R for taking away your Lifetime Achievement Award?  Well, I really think they should be ashamed of themselves, but I don't think that they're  capable of shame.  And I just wonder how they figured to give me the award in the first place if I was such 
[01:04:30]  a horrible creature, so undeserving.  When did they first discover it?  It's just, it's obviously just a disgusting example of just being cowards.  And a lot of times I think white people react to racism like that because they're afraid  if they don't, their own racism is going to be revealed.  It's almost like the way black guys will distance themselves from a black guy who's a mugger.  White people distance themselves from anything that's racially inappropriate because they're  afraid it's a reflection on the way they really feel.  So we're obviously fans and we're sorry it happened to you, but it's almost good it happened 
[01:05:00]  because we'll just point out how disgusting R&R is for Iran and steam.  Definitely, and I certainly don't hold any race responsible for this because the guy that  was sending the emails is a white guy.  And I think the public ought to know that.  You know, sometimes people assume, oh, it must be a black person.  No, it rarely, it rarely is a black person.  I mean, not everybody's Jesse, not everybody's Al. 
[01:05:30]  So, by the way, I want to ask you guys, are you going to the R&R convention?  No, no.  We're rarely invited and we've never gone to any of their functions.  We just don't believe in any of that crap.  Now, before I do leave, I want to hear Anthony do his famous limitations.  All right, Anthony with the famous Bob Grant.  Okay, here we go. 
[01:06:00]  Here we go.  Get off my phone, forging ahead.  Hey, you know, that's so good, it's scary because you could go around using that voice  saying things and I'd get blamed.  Hey, it's the great Bob Grant.  You know, keep going strong there, Bob.  Yeah, we love you, man.  Big fans.  Been fans for years.  All right, guys.  All right, we'll be in touch, all right?  Straight ahead.  All right, there he goes. 
[01:06:30]  Straight ahead, right.  There goes Bob Grant.  Great impression, Anthony.  Thank you.  All right, the Opie and Anthony Show, phone number is 877-212-0NA.  Still to come on the show, we got Sylvester Stallone calling in at 8 o'clock to what, promote  Rambo for about 7 minutes?  8-10, we got him for like 10 minutes.  And then at 8.30, we have Andrew Morton stopping in who wrote the book on Tom Cruise.  All right.  Very good.  Anthony.  You all right?  Oh. 
[01:07:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-0NA.  Patrice O'Neill in studio today.  And Patrice, once again, you got the phones lit.  So why don't we say hi to Joe in New York?  Joe, what's up, buddy?  How you doing?  All right, Joe.  Hey, how you doing?  I just wanted to ask, why is it right for him to say Cracker and stuff like that?  And we're not allowed to say the N-word.  Well, first of all, Cracker doesn't have the same social implication. 
[01:07:30]  And the same punch that the good old N-word has.  I don't think there's a white guy alive that cares if he's called a Cracker.  Hey, I mean, I don't care if I'm called a Cracker, but everybody's screaming about being equal and everything like that.  But I think you're picking on the wrong person.  I don't think Patrice cares if you use the N-word.  Patrice encourages it.  Right.  He don't care.  He's not about the double standard.  I want a fair fight, man.  I don't want white people.  Now that I'm actually really allowed to be, you know, I mean, not that I'm, put it this way. 
[01:08:00]  I didn't fight to be able to be how I am.  Somebody else fought to be how I am.  And I'm taking advantage of all the things I can say.  And now white people are acting like, poor me.  I can't be racist no more.  So now that you can't be racist, just like what white people do, if nobody can, you're taking your ball and going home.  You're trying to figure out a way to have me stop having fun with the language.  But that's, I disagree with that.  Only because, hold on, sir. 
[01:08:30]  White people aren't saying that you can't be white.  The problem with white people is, like, we get tired of, like, things being misinterpreted as racist when they're not by other white people.  Like, my problem when it comes to race stuff is not what black people complain about because it's rare.  Sharpton doesn't count as the average black person.  It's other white people who like to show how non-racist they are by scolding.  But you never hear, now, that view is unique.  But, like, this guy here, he's not saying that. 
[01:09:00]  He'll never say that.  He gets on this situation.  And here's the problem with dudes like this.  It's not Sharpton.  It's like a Bill O'Reilly kind of guy.  And your misinterpretation of what black people are saying as being white.  Bill O'Reilly has you confused that you're him, that you're a white guy like him.  He's the white guy that black people talk about.  Bill O'Reilly's a white guy.  Not you, Fred, or whatever, that you're going to work.  Or Joe, Joe, the guy from Long Island. 
[01:09:30]  You're not my oppressor.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  It's a certain, it's an ideology that includes you as the N-word.  That's what I'm saying.  You're the N-word too, Joe.  So that's what I'm saying is stop trying to be a victim.  All of a sudden, the tables are turned.  We're in charge.  All right, let's say how to Mel the trucker.  Mel, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up, Mel?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, Mel. 
[01:10:00]  Patrice is right.  You know what?  A lot of people just need to just relax.  I don't care about people using the N-word.  It's some people that are just stuck on certain, I don't know what it is, ideologies of what.  If people would just be up front with each other and say, look, I'm racist.  This is why I don't like you.  And maybe we can have a little bit more respect for people and we can all get along a little bit better.  Why can't I be racist?  That's what I'm saying.  I don't care if you're racist. 
[01:10:30]  But why can't?  I'm like, why can't?  See, the thing is, we're dealing with a new thing, which is covert racism now.  It's rare that no one's sickened dogs.  I know that the cops do what they do.  But for the most part, I don't need white people to have to like me.  You can be racist if you want to.  I don't understand why I got to like you.  Do you care if white guys are racist in general?  It doesn't bother me.  It doesn't bother me if a black guy's racist.  It doesn't bother me if a white guy's racist.  But I think there's a lot. 
[01:11:00]  If you notice what's going on, it's a lot of old black folks and a lot of old white folks that are fighting.  Still battling it out.  Still upset about busting.  I just think it's old people fighting.  They'll be in the old age home together with their walkers with the tennis balls on the bottom, and they'll still be going at it, man.  Going after Imus.  And like that Imus thing, you know what that was at the end of the day?  It was like, okay, we're going to, it's like white people, old white man goes, all right, listen now.  We're going to trade, boy. 
[01:11:30]  We're going to give you Seinfeld's buddy that slide through the door, and we're going to give you the old man Imus.  Okay?  We're going to give you him.  And what you do is you give us that damn hip-hop.  We want hip-hop.  We want to just mess it up.  We don't like these young Negroes.  So you trade that, and the black, all black people hate hip-hop.  So they go, sure.  We're going to give you, give us the two white guys and put three black people on MSNBC, CNN, and Fox, and then you get to tear hip-hop apart. 
[01:12:00]  And you get to destroy the N-word also.  You can wipe it out.  And that's the deal they're making.  To old people making deals.  For nothing.  May I say one more thing?  Sure, man.  I am 39 years old.  I'm black.  I'm a truck driver.  I was born in Mississippi, raised in California.  I hear this mess all day on the CB.  It's to the point to where it doesn't too much bother me that the people out here are using the N-word. 
[01:12:30]  But don't hide behind it.  Come to my face and say it and explain to me why you feel the way you feel.  And I will respect you a whole lot more.  Mel, you lost me when you said you were a black truck driver.  That's like being black and in the NHL.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  Yes.  How many black guys are in the trucking industry?  That's like black skydiver.  Right.  I know.  You've got to be insane to be a black truck driver. 
[01:13:00]  And you drive down south and all that?  You know what?  I like the insane money that I make.  I understand.  I work hard and I'm doing an honest job.  I used to be an old drug dealer.  Back in my younger days, I grew up in South Central, so I know what it's like to live on the street.  And I just turned my life around.  And this is an honest career that I'm in now.  But a lot of people still don't respect just the skin color that you have, which is the dumbest thing. 
[01:13:30]  You know what?  If you don't like me, sit me down.  Let's have a cup of coffee.  Let's talk about what you do.  Do you ever kill a white hooker?  And go from there.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you all about the white hookers?  They'll never find you.  You won't be profile.  What are they called?  The lot?  What are they called?  Lot lizards.  Lot lizards?  They're called the lot lizards.  And yes, I love the white hoes.  You like the white hoes?  Is it a guarantee you're going to be voting for Obama, Mel?  No, you know what?  I'm not voting for none of those clowns because all of them are stupid. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  We do need a change in this country.  Obama's not going to do it.  Mrs. Clinton's not going to do it.  The whole system's jacked up.  I don't like what I see.  And these clowns are voting for Obama because he's black.  They're stupid.  These females are voting for Hillary because he's a woman.  Yep.  They're stupid.  So you know what?  People need to just wake up and look inside themselves before they make these decisions 
[01:14:30]  instead of just going with the status quo.  Well, we just started a new bit.  We're just asking people on the street who they're voting for and why.  And their answers are unbelievable.  No one knows the issues at hand.  No one knows what these candidates actually stand for.  And when I say no one, I'm talking about probably a majority of people out there.  I'm sure there's a bunch that do and they study this stuff.  But in general, there's a lot of people that are going to vote for Barack or not vote for Barack because he's black.  And the same thing with Hillary and the woman thing. 
[01:15:00]  And that's what it comes down to.  Not what she might do or attempt to do when she's in office.  Yes, that is true.  But like I said, there's a bunch of clowns and idiots out here in this world.  And they're just let alone by their nose and what they see and hear on television.  Excuse me, radio also.  Jimmy, I love you.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  I love all you guys.  I love all you guys.  I'm a full-time listener and I got to get off this radio.  All right.  Because I'm coming up on these scales and the police are right behind me. 
[01:15:30]  All right, man.  Thanks a lot.  God, you must get really scared when you see the police.  It all balls down.  We get all civil rightsy until we see a cop.  Right.  Oh, damn.  We show over.  Oh, man.  Oh, they got to weigh my truck again.  I have a dream.  Oh, damn, cop.  Shut up.  And let me tell you something about these crackers.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  Charlie's bombing.  Oh, damn.  Stick your black fist out the window and say, wait here, sucker.  Yeah, just take off and do a little Tyrone in the bandit. 
[01:16:00]  Just get on top of your semi and do the George Jefferson dance on top.  Right.  Hey, this is the perfect time to play this story that we were going to get to, but then  Bob Grant called.  Someone got fined for using the N-word.  Of course.  Go ahead.  Well, fine from what?  And again, it was a black guy.  I don't know.  Let's go to it.  This Passaic, New Jersey public works employee decided to go to court when a man used racial 
[01:16:30]  slurs against him.  The N-word is this.  Hold on.  By the way, Nate in Georgia, Opie, you got to be S-ing me.  I work in a warehouse in Georgia and 75% of truck drivers are black.  In that area, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  I reject it.  You're out of touch, you silly goose.  Watch the language, sir.  This is radio.  Look, when you think truck driver, are you thinking black?  No.  And he's, I just reject that 75%.  There's only 25% white guys with these jobs that you make a lot of money being a trucker 
[01:17:00]  and you got to drive cross country.  You think they're letting 75% of Negroes just drive around this country in a, you know,  in your hooker killing machine?  I'm sure they would let them, but stop it.  I don't think anybody would stop black guys being a trucker.  75% stop.  I just don't think that that's realistic.  Trucking is responsible for three quarters of the businesses in this country to shut down  if trucks didn't operate.  Like, if they just stop.  So, I just think that there's not enough black people to do that job.  So, they do a few.  Really?  What?  The 20 million?  And probably 10 who have licenses? 
[01:17:30]  What are you talking about?  I'm saying, like, listen.  I'm listening.  There's over 100 million white people.  There's more than that.  That's not what I said over.  That was very good, Noah.  That was very, very good.  Go ahead, man.  That was quick as hell.  I got to give him that one.  I wanted to ignore that one.  That was a good one.  Go ahead.  I just think that, like, the odds are there's going to be more white truckers.  I'm only saying just because there's more white people.  I don't think that with less of a population, you'd have a 75%. 
[01:18:00]  It just doesn't make sense.  It's statistically.  Right, right.  Numerically, that's all.  Okay, let's get to the story because it's pretty interesting.  This Passaic, New Jersey, public works employee decided to go to court when a man used racial slurs against him.  The N-word is not a word.  It's the word that comes, the negative effect of it.  He had his work truck parked on a city street when the verbal barrage struck.  He got angry, and you're calling me a million names.  And finally, he called me the N-word.  The man who made the comments ended up paying a $150 fine. 
[01:18:30]  At least fine, you know.  So they learned that this is everybody's city, this is everybody's country.  This man agreed with the punishment.  I even went to jail behind that, honestly, for a Caucasian calling me that.  Me acting out only got me four years in prison.  The city worker is just glad he got his day in court.  The gentleman here apologized, and I apologize, accepted.  Move on.  It should have just been an apology going to court. 
[01:19:00]  I would like to know, what they're doing is they're dollying this story up, for lack of another old lady way of speaking.  But they're adding to this, he was probably caught on some kind of a public nuisance thing.  Or there's probably something where if you're screaming at a person or whatever, it was probably in the context of that.  And that was probably the example they cited.  Like, that doesn't make sense.  He just dropped an N-bomb and got fined.  Right.  In court.  It just doesn't make sense.  But that would be on the road where I think it's trying to lead to, which is to ban the word from anybody. 
[01:19:30]  Like, because if you ban that word, who, and you, if you could go to jail and get fined saying that word, white people don't say that word.  Unless they're home.  I always say it.  Not to get fined.  No.  Like, I say it to get fined.  What's up?  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Right, right, right.  I get fined by that.  So it's like, who's that hurting?  It's not white people don't even say it.  By the way, Kevin from Connecticut backing up a little bit. 
[01:20:00]  Smokey and the Defendant.  That's funny.  That's funny.  I was trying to start a bid and Kevin, you know, went with it.  So thank you to Kevin.  I went with Tyrone and the Bandit.  He's going with Smokey and the Defendant.  Tyrone and the Bandit is better.  All right, well, I was attempting a bid and Kevin acknowledged it at least.  Let's say hi to Vinny in Brooklyn.  Vinny!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Vinny.  Love you guys.  You guys are awesome.  Welcome aboard.  What's up?  Straight ahead. 
[01:20:30]  Listen, listen, I don't understand something.  How come it's okay for people on the street to say, I'm voting for Obama because he's black,  but if a white guy says, hey guys, I'm not voting for Obama because he's black, he gets in trouble.  I mean, I don't know people on the street are running around yelling, I'm voting for him because he's black.  That's like saying, I'm running from the police because I'm black, and the police saying, I'm not chasing you because you're...  Patrice, I love you, man.  Patrice, you're awesome.  Yeah, Patrice, explain that, though. 
[01:21:00]  Like, a black guy can say, I want to vote for Obama because he's black, but if a white guy does say it, quickly you go, he's a racist.  But that, but that, I just want to understand that because the guy kind of makes a good point.  One is racial, and one is racist.  Not necessarily, no, no, no, no.  No, because if you're voting for someone just because they're black, that's how you're dolling it up.  But it could just be because you don't like the other guys because they're white.  I mean, it depends, you know what I'm saying?  There's no difference.  But it has to be, the fact being, though, that's, I keep saying this, if white people can be honest for five seconds about racism or race, these arguments or these conversations wouldn't happen because black people are free enough to go mentally, you know, hey, I'm going to vote for him because he's black. 
[01:21:30]  But you got to understand, historically, white person will vote for, it's been nothing but white males as the leader of this country forever since this country has had presidents.  You don't think that's racial?  There wasn't another better candidate somewhere? 
[01:22:00]  There was some black people that ran, there's some white women that ran at one point or a black woman that ran.  Again, you're making this racial.  The whole world, all of a sudden, we have to sit here and have examples of black people being racist?  Like, how come you can say that?  You've been able to say nigger freely till yesterday.  Well, that's, white people are being frustrated and they're asking black people the question.  But the real problem, again, is the scolding from other white people. 
[01:22:30]  That's the real problem.  I mean, again, guys like Sharpton, they're just opportunists who, they hear a slip up.  Well, white guilt is your problem.  That's why, but that's why I think black people.  You guys taught me about this white guilt thing.  I had no clue about this until I started.  Black people, Opie, should stay out of this language game because for the most part, one of our biggest allies is white guilt.  White people going, that's why Michael Jackson's not in jail.  White guilt.  That's why, you know, it's a lot of things that happen because of white guilt.  And let's not be, and not to be an apologist, but all the struggle that we had in this country, there's always been white people. 
[01:23:00]  There's always been a section of white people who are like, this is just wrong on a human level and helped abolitionists and Jews in the 20s.  And a lot of white people died during civil rights, man.  A lot of white people helped.  It's not like we're like, oh, white people.  It's just, it's just, it's to have a discussion about it, man, is you need two people admitting something. 
[01:23:30]  You can't have a racial discussion when white people say nonsense like, how come you can say that?  And we can't because it's a double standard.  We, you hung us, you beat us, you beat us with dogs, you hold us down and beat us with dogs, but whatever.  You know what I'm saying?  People are really angry.  You've done all of this stuff and we can't say what we want for five minutes?  You're not giving us no money like you gave the Japanese?  Let us have language for something, something. 
[01:24:00]  You're right.  The only problem I have with that is when I'm being scolded by those same guilt-ridden white people who are scolding me because what I'm saying to be funny or for whatever reason is a reflection on the way they really feel.  That's my only problem.  Black people should say whatever.  But now we're losing that because we're being unreasonable where now we're chasing a white guy every time he makes a racial slip or we're attacking, lose his job.  Now white guilt is becoming something that's not our ally where white people aren't, they're coming together to now fight against black people with this language thing and this new white people are a victim thing. 
[01:24:30]  It's not like it was before when we were actually victims and people felt like we were victims.  Now people are starting to feel like we're not and they're trying to make me think that this is equal in this country.  I'm equal now?  Okay.  Okay.  I'm equal.  I'll go with the okey-doke.  The banana in the tailpipe. 
[01:25:00]  I ain't falling for it.  That's why I say black people just stop.  Let white people say goofy stuff so we can fight what's going on.  You know what I'm saying?  That's all I'm saying because now it's covert.  It's underneath.  There's no way to prove you're a racist now.  Before there was a way, you go, wait a minute, the dude just beat me in the head because I'm black.  But now it's hard to prove that you're racist.  No, anything racial is perceived as being racist.  Like when you look at, again, the media is a bunch of guilt-ridden white people. 
[01:25:30]  When you look at the way like Fat Nick, the guy from Brooklyn who hit the black guy with the bat,  everybody knows they were thugs to steal a thing, and him and his dumb friends were thugs.  That's all that was.  And he was on the front page of the paper for months because he was a white person.  The other white people could point out and go, see, he's the problem.  It's not us.  It's him.  That's all that is.  I mean, it's, you know, I lost my point.  All right.  Right on.  Let's go to Anthony in Syracuse.  Anthony.  Yes.  What's up, Anthony? 
[01:26:00]  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, you guys rock, Jimmy.  You're the funniest cat around.  Oh, thanks, sir.  Patrice.  Patrice, you rock also.  I just disagree with a couple of your beliefs and whatnot.  Okay.  And I don't believe that white people are not afraid to be racist and stuff like that.  That's true.  The white people in a lot of places aren't afraid to be racist.  The white people that we deal with in New York or, you know, Los Angeles in our business are horrendous. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, we live in kind of a different area.  You'd be surprised when you're there with the rest of the country.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  They embrace it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, Manhattan was built on getting, you know, everyone together and trying to figure  out how to get everyone to get along.  So.  Right.  By the way, for Obama to win the presidency, he's going to need the white vote.  Oh, of course.  Just the whole point.  And people don't understand that point.  If we end up having the first black president, there's going to be a lot of white people that  voted for Barack Obama.  No one understands that.  Every white person. 
[01:27:00]  And the more I read about Barack Obama, there's a movement going on with young white voters  that want to vote for Barack Obama.  That's why.  That's why I think it's hilarious when people get scared about, you know, the potential that  we're going to have a black president.  Whitey has to come out and vote for Barack Obama in the end.  And that's why every single black person votes for Barack Obama.  It doesn't get the job done.  That's why he has to be even.  That's why he has to.  He cannot ever say he can't even say the word dark skin. 
[01:27:30]  Because like Jimmy was support black.  That's why he can't like look at the stats, because like Jimmy was pointing out, there's  a hell of a lot more white people in this country than black people.  50 million white people.  He has to get white votes.  And if for one second they think he's going to be the black president instead of the light  skin, dark skin president who's not really for black people, he has to convince white  people that he's just a regular guy.  That's why he's using U2 music as a song.  He has to. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  He has to.  Black people are going to vote for him anyway.  That's why I always thought a black Republican had a better shot, by the way.  Because he would get a lot of, a black Republican I think would have a big crossover from white  people that want to see it and from black people that are typically Democrat.  What planet are they going to get that candidate from?  Alan Keyes.  They're just conservative black guys.  Well, Colin Powell.  True.  But I mean.  Yeah.  It's not like there's a lot of them, though.  He's not going to be the president, dude.  You know, I was doing a man on the street thing where I was just asking people to put 
[01:28:30]  in order who they thought the most important to the least important between black men,  white men, white women, black women.  White men are just a number one across the board.  And, and, and it would be black, white women, then black women, then black men would always  be last in terms of who you think is the most important entity out of those four in this  country.  Black women?  Black women were ahead of black men.  Oprah maybe one.  Oprah maybe entire.  Just because it's a fear level, man. 
[01:29:00]  It's still there.  It's a, it's a, such a fear level, a visceral fear level of black men, dude.  Black women sleeping with your wives and your women and the, the running, the jumping, the,  just the fear of what black men will do if we get into some white power position that  we're going to now cook, cook you.  That's true.  And it is ridiculous to have that fear.  And if you look at South Africa, you'll see things are going well.  Do you want a black president?  Do you want Barack?  Sorry.  To be honest with me, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Symbolism, just to be alive, to see something like that, yeah.  Thank you.  I'm with, I, I said it the other day and my logic is ridiculous.  Most listeners know that.  I want a black president because I want interesting stuff to happen during my lifetime.  Yeah.  I want to be alive to see a black president and, and, and to see what that actually means  in the end.  Yeah.  I mean, symbolism, yeah.  I want to see another, I mean, in terms of changing things, I don't know, but symbolism,  yeah.  I want to see another tsunami during my lifetime.  I want to see the craziest earthquake of all time happen during my lifetime.  The media.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  I want to be alive for the media.  Yes.  I like the way you, you, you lump a black president in with a tsunami and an earthquake.  With natural disasters.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh man, Jimmy, I was getting away with one, man.  Oh man.  If there's a watchdog group that was listening to that just now, if you didn't do that.  Oh, you see what he's saying?  Obama's a natural disaster waiting to happen.  I want to see two things happen in my life.  I hate you.  Black president and Cloverfield really happening. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  And it's the same to me.  Negro running through the city kicking stuff.  I want two things.  A black president and an ebonic plague coming back.  You did say a bunch of.  Hey, it went right over your head.  Not the dodo bird to become un-extinct.  I want rats to take over Manhattan.  Boy, I wish the tuna population would just re-establish itself.  Jimmy doesn't miss a beat, man. 
[01:31:00]  I had a great point going.  It was just very funny.  Maybe I should have, you know, come up with some better examples.  Oh, man.  Black president and the end of the world.  Not even the flying Jetsons car was in there.  Yeah, yeah.  Something positive.  Like, yeah, exactly.  The Jetson car.  Cure for AIDS and a black president.  Nope.  The AIDS, whatever.  But the flying car, wonderful.  Wonderful for everybody.  And to figure out that rocket pack thing.  So that Negro can fly to outer space and never come back. 
[01:31:30]  So white people can get out.  We're nervous.  A big, long line full of rocket packs.  Free rocket packs for white people everywhere.  Damn, I was on to something, Tim.  Oh, man.  Black president and lots of natural disasters.  Yes, that's what you got from my little rant.  Of course.  Subliminal.  Hmm.  Let my people go.  All right.  We'll take a break and hopefully talk to Sylvester Stallone after the break, right? 
[01:32:00]  About Rambo and other things?  Yes.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  I said Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What happened, Iraq?  So what happened?  What crashed?  CBS.  CBS crashed?  Oh.  So what do we do now?  What do we do?  Oh, Jimmy.  Your mic's not even on. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, no.  What do we do?  We have to actually, like, improvise and stuff?  The network crashed, so they're trying to figure out how to go to break.  Oh, that's wonderful.  See what you did, Patrice?  I blame you.  That's right.  I blame you.  Wow.  I want a black president and all radio to not work.  That is a sign.  That is a sign.  I'm scantin' that.  Oh, yes.  Yes, I do want to see Los Angeles detached from the United States, like Bill Hicks suggested  back in the day.  Thank you to whoever wrote that. 
[01:33:00]  Bill from Waterford.  Perfect.  Yes.  Is this an XM problem or a CBS problem?  CBS.  What happened?  What is CBS doing?  The computer died.  That's supposed to go to the affiliates and all the breaks.  Well, then what happens?  All is black talk.  And yes, I did say ebonic plague.  I meant to say the bubonic plague, yes.  But I was very excited.  The ebonic plague.  I was very excited about my little theory.  Yes, but that was actually more accurate.  Right.  The ebonic plague.  See, you need me to mess up to set these idiots up. 
[01:33:30]  Iraq is whispering and panicking.  He's just a nervous man.  He's talking into a headset.  Iraq finally has to do something.  He doesn't know what to do.  No, he's spinning out of control.  He's spiraling like a dove.  All that sweat coming off his teeny little nose.  Oh, it's awful.  This is turning into a very, very, very weird day.  He does have a...  A strange, strange day.  Blondie's husband from the cartoon nose.  I'd like to just rearrange it with my fist.  He just bugs me.  He's just fat and skinny everywhere. 
[01:34:00]  Fat and skinny.  Cheeks is fat.  Eyelids are skinny.  What happened?  Just a mess.  Hey, Iraq.  How about you give us some info?  Exactly.  Instead of just sitting there talking to them.  They're almost back up.  Almost back up.  How do they know that?  What are they doing?  Are they rebooting?  They're rebuilding the log right now.  How do you rebuild a log?  Well, you eat a lot of bread.  I was going to say you hold your girl tightly.  Rebuild a thing.  I can't believe that. 
[01:34:30]  I didn't get it.  I didn't get it.  I wasn't sure I was going to get something.  Damn it.  I love how honest Patrice is.  I don't like blacks in general.  It doesn't mean I'm racist.  And it's coming from Boston.  Well, let me ask you a question.  Yeah, yeah.  How many times do you have to have a bad experience with one race, one ethnic group before you're allowed to not like them?  I say you could just hear about it from a friend once.  Wow. 
[01:35:00]  If you just go, I don't like them.  I can't say them, but I have a list of who I don't like.  I think it's just human nature.  You know, you don't like people that aren't like you.  Because it's like.  Whether it's black, white, or because you think differently.  All that crap.  Wait.  We can break now?  Do you want to answer that, Jimmy, real fast?  I want to talk to the Boston guy.  This is classic.  Maybe after the break.  Stay there, Tim.  Oh, no.  I wasn't even.  How many examples?  I was just kidding.  I mean, I don't know. 
[01:35:30]  I mean.  Tough question.  How many did it take me?  I have no idea.  I think my first gig with Patrice cemented it.  What a prick you were.  I killed.  By the way, the answer is we don't know.  That's right.  Oh, no.  I was talking about something else.  Sweetie.  Sylvester Stallone next.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding, right?  You said they were ready to go.  Now what?  I think E-Rock's getting bad information. 
[01:36:00]  E-Rock?  Oh, great.  What now?  What happened?  What happened?  The files are playing.  CBS can't get the audio running.  Really?  We can't go to break.  See what you did, Patrice.  We can't go to break.  Getting stranger and stranger.  Well, the files are playing.  Why don't you just tell them?  It's that black voodoo.  Yeah, well, let's say hi to Tim in Boston listening on BCN.  Hey, Tim.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, what's going on?  Are we on in New York?  We're on in New York.  We're finding out the rest.  All right.  Look at E-Rock panicking.  I know.  They see this idea of exercising. 
[01:36:30]  He's just walking quickly.  And now Tim's panicking.  What, Tim?  That is why?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, the button wasn't down.  What button?  Opie, were you supposed to push a button?  I wasn't supposed to push a button.  Are we ready to go, then?  Let's try it.  Well, where's E-Rock?  Now we're E-Rock.  Get back here.  Get in here.  All right, Tim, hold on the line.  All right.  We're going to get this show back on track.  Eric is going to try.  All right.  Now what, E-Rock?  Can we go to break?  Yeah, you can go to break.  All right.  Know what happened?  This is going to pain me. 
[01:37:00]  What?  This is going to pain me.  Look at his face.  What?  For the first time in over 20 years of broadcasting, I made a...  I made a...  A what?  A...  Ike, Ike, Ike.  Write it down.  For the first time ever, I made a...  A mistake.  Oh, what'd you do?  I got so excited talking about my natural disasters and the black president. 
[01:37:30]  I'm just playing like a keyboard over here, and I'm just turning buttons on, turning them  off, and I turned off a very crucial button to the whole broadcast.  You didn't press the network shutdown button.  This stupid button right here, you turn it off, all hell breaks loose.  All right.  So we can break now before Stallone?  He's calling right now.  All right.  Well, what?  He's calling at 8-10.  He's not calling right now.  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  Let's just break and come back real quick.  It was my fault.  All right.  I have to take the blame. 
[01:38:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Sylvester Stallone next.  All right.  We're all over the place today.  I got to give a secret message to the affiliates.  We're coming back early, and we'll give you a few seconds here to try to join the program  because we have Sly Stallone on the phone line, and he's a busy man.  He can't wait for our crap to be figured out.  Is that good enough, Tom?  Yes.  Just give him 10 seconds to come back or whatever.  All right.  Tom said give him a couple seconds.  Hopefully, he'll rejoin the program. 
[01:38:30]  If not, what can I tell you?  I wouldn't, though.  If we got Stallone on the phone, what are they going to do?  Play another boring commercial?  Right.  We'll pant the next one.  Yeah, we'll figure it out down the road, but we're back live with the Opie and Anthony  Show, and on the phone, we got Sylvester Stallone.  Mr. Stallone.  Hi.  How are you, sir?  Very good, thanks.  I don't feel good calling you Sly or Sylvester.  Why not?  No, no.  Live on the edge.  I call him double S.  Double S.  That's what I call him, baby.  Like Sharon Stone.  Hero to both blacks and whites. 
[01:39:00]  One of the few.  Schwarzenegger?  Yeah.  One.  Sly, the other.  And it might be one more.  Bruce Lee.  Hero to all.  Lock Up and Rocky III.  My two favorite movies.  Thank you.  Hey, you call from Los Angeles or you're in New York?  I just got to New York last night.  Okay, so at least you're not at 5 o'clock in the morning time.  No.  Yeah, you know what?  There is something to that.  You're right.  I'm actually looking at your bio, and it's amazing to me that like 16 years after the 
[01:39:30]  last Rocky, you did Rocky Balboa.  Was that your choice, or did the studio want you to do it?  Like, why did you decide to redo it after such a long layoff?  Well, truthfully, the studio was completely opposed to it.  That's why it even took, I would have done it 10 years later.  But, you know, times change.  The paradigm changes.  The administration changes.  The whole outlook of the business changes.  And it became much more what we call a tentpole industry, where you'd make very, very large  commercial films, a la Spider-Man, and the smaller kind of films. 
[01:40:00]  And Rocky was kind of like an independent film that caught on.  And the fact that I wanted to play it at my age didn't exactly send off rockets in their  heads.  You know what, though?  I didn't know if I was going to like it or not.  And I watched it, and I thought you did a really great job with it.  I love the direction it went into.  It was like a really, it was a believable storyline.  I mean, it wasn't a guy coming back and just knocking out all these young contenders.  It was great.  Exactly.  I thought if you made it an exhibition fight, it would be plausible.  But more importantly was, can you hook on to his dilemma? 
[01:40:30]  If you can, then you have a story.  What was his dilemma?  Well, you know, you've lost everything in your life, things that really, really matter.  How do you go on to the second half of your life knowing that you've lost the things that  have been most precious to your love, your wife, your child?  Can you find some kind of enthusiasm that sparks an interest to keep moving forward?  Wow.  Now, 20 years later, you're releasing Rambo, which is just called John Rambo, or is it just  called... 
[01:41:00]  Well, it was going to be called John Rambo, and then we wanted to be clever and go, like,  why not to, like, to Hell and Back or Up Blood River, and then it started sounding like a,  you know, a serial film.  Then John Feldhummer runs Lion's Gate and says, why don't we just do something that's...  I just call it Rambo, and even though we've had a movie called Rambo, I think there's  been enough time in between that you can't mistake that.  Now, what's going on with the, you remember the Andre the Giant stickers they used to have  around?  No. 
[01:41:30]  Remember that, those Andre the Giant faces?  It's just a drawn face of Andre the Giant.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got, like, that thing going on in the streets.  Oh, you got the Rambo...  It's just that drawn...  It's his face just stamped on everything.  Yeah, just kind of...  As Rambo.  What is that about?  You know, guys, that to me is...  That came from Lion's Gate, a man named Tim Palin, and I think it's actually genius.  I never would have expected it.  They'd taken a regular photo and sort of reduced it to, like, street art.  And it's so, so, I don't know, obvious from a long distance away. 
[01:42:00]  And then I said, you know what?  It's just catching on subconsciously.  You know, it looks like the Che Guevara.  Right, right, right, right.  Which still burns into people's brains.  Well, Andre the Giant stickers.  I don't remember the Andre the Giant stickers.  It's just a round, you know what I mean?  All right, all right.  I'm waiting for Cliffhanger, the 20th anniversary one.  Oh, man.  You're going to be waiting along.  This time he gets a job as a window washer.  One of the...  That Cliffhanger was a great movie, man. 
[01:42:30]  One of the best opening scenes ever shot was you hanging off that rope, holding her hand and looking down.  Wait a minute.  Was he disgusted with Cliffhanger?  No, it's just probably who wants to hang it.  No, no, no, no.  I mean, Sylvester Stallone, like, were you...  Is that one of your favorites or is that one of your least favorites?  It is one of my favorites.  I'm saying the idea of going through those heights and the hardship.  I mean, I'm not a height person.  And after a while, you just can't take it anymore. 
[01:43:00]  You're going to work 12,000 feet in the air every day.  So you were doing, like, a lot of rock climbing and stuff yourself, right?  Well, to a point, yeah, because you have to.  Well, you know, but something happens when you're doing films like that, and a lot of mountain climbers said it to be true.  After about a month, you go up there, you're terrified.  Then after about a month, you find yourself going closer and closer to the edge, turning your back, eating your lunch, hanging over the side.  And it just pushes man's ego to see how far you can go before you fall to your death. 
[01:43:30]  All right, sir.  Now, here it is now.  Don't take offense.  I just need to know.  All right.  What is the back story of Viagra Rambo?  What is that?  The old man Rambo, the 20-year-later Rambo.  Not you, but the dude who's, like, 20 years from the last dude who fought the Russians.  Exactly.  Well, he goes back to Thailand.  He lives on the border of Burma.  And I've seen, I perceive this guy as kind of moving back into the jungle, almost becoming animalistic, because he doesn't communicate with humanity anymore. 
[01:44:00]  He's lost his faith in God.  He's lost his faith in humanity.  But he's very, very strong, very brutal, very powerful.  And he's a river man.  He's a boat man.  And these people have to get into Burma, these missionaries, because they do this truthfully every year.  And the only way to get in there is upriver, because all the mines, all the trails have been mined.  And that begins the adventure where Rambo now starts to feel a rekindled connection with humanity. 
[01:44:30]  But I think I was in the best shape.  I've been in a long time for that.  But I wanted to be not a bodybuilder look, but more of a working class, hard man, like a lumberjack.  You mean more like the original Rocky, where you were big and strong, but not necessarily cut.  Exactly right.  Exactly right.  And we accomplished that.  So the audience would say, oh, okay, this is believable.  But it's not vain, and it's not self-conscious of trying to look vascular and all that sort of stuff. 
[01:45:00]  And you're 60 years old, right?  61.  Wow.  61.  Amazing.  Holy moly.  Don't get me out of that one.  Did you ever?  And that's why I call it Viagra Ram.  I mean, it's just like, you know, I'm not enough.  Jeez, I'm just joking.  It's amazing.  Now, okay, we were just talking about all the stuff we were just talking about, the racial stuff or whatever.  Now, remember in Rocky, not in Rocky.  Rocky 5.  Not Rocky 5.  Rambo, First Blood 2.  And that girl and the pretty girl that was like, Wambo, Wambo. 
[01:45:30]  And the...  Asian girl.  Ridiculous.  Are they going to be having that kind of stuff now?  Are the people in the movie like, you know, we're Vietnamese and we...  You know, there's none of that.  No.  Rambo.  We just had to be as truthful as we can.  Good.  So we actually hired because the worst situation in the world right now, longest running civil war and the bloodiest is in Burma.  It's been going on for 60 years.  So the hardest thing was to get Burmese refugees to play themselves because they're still terrified because the Burmese secret police are always coming over the border trying to pull them back. 
[01:46:00]  So we didn't get into, you know, casting for just, you know, a shock effect.  We stayed pretty much with the real people over there.  So it's mostly Burmese and myself and this group of Christian missionaries from, let's say, Colorado.  So one of, I'm going to guess one of your favorite things, one of my favorite things that you ever did, and I think it took a lot of people off guard was when you did Copland.  The type of a role you played there, which was kind of like this, the guy who doesn't necessarily win. 
[01:46:30]  Exactly.  Is that something that you would do more of?  Because it was really great to see people, like, you forget, like, oh yeah, this guy's like not just doing action movies, but he's, you know, he's a real actor and he's, you know, people kind of, I think, lose sight of that sometimes with the action stuff.  You know, that's, that call, it falls under the category of Cavalier to Wish, where I love doing ensemble work.  There's nothing to me that's more pleasurable.  So when I did that, I thought it would open up different avenues and because everyone always says, oh, the most important thing for an artist to do is stretch. 
[01:47:00]  So we stretched, I stretched my waistline, I stretched everything, but actually it hurt me.  Did it really?  Yeah, it did.  It really did.  And so people said, oh, he's not into action films anymore.  He's doing character work, but we, the audience doesn't perceive him as that.  So all these mixed messages were sent.  And truthfully, guys, that was the beginning of the end for about eight years.  That's too bad because you were great in that movie.  Yeah, it's like.  I know, it broke my heart, too. 
[01:47:30]  But your boy, your boy, that's what his M.O. was.  He was, he was famous for that.  Al Pacino, not Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, he got famous for just losing weight and getting fat.  What's the difference, guys, is that if you're connected to a character, especially first, you know, right out of the box, like Rocky, so tightly connected to it, where Bobby never had that, he was more versatile.  He would do a variety of parts, but not be connected to one.  That pretty much follows you around.  But when you're stuck with that, which is a blessing in one way and another, you're not going to get rid of it. 
[01:48:00]  Even if, to this day, if you say James Bond, you still think Sean Connery.  Right.  So you're thinking like, like an example with De Niro is the amazing transition from Raging Bull, and then the next film is the king of comedy.  Right.  Whereas you, you, you kind of.  I couldn't pull that off.  But do you, like, as, just as a performer, because you are Stallone, I mean, you pretty much obviously will turn down scripts all day until you find something you like.  I mean, no one is going to tell you what you have to do.  Do you kind of find that, like, I want to have the commercial success more, or is something like that you'd be satisfied with, like a Copland, more important to you? 
[01:48:30]  Well, therein lies a big dilemma.  You'd like to do the artistic pieces, but then again, you do want to also reach as many, I think, of the public as possible.  So I would, I would opt more now for doing populist films, say, like a Rambo, things that will go out there and have the widest audience.  Because I, I, I've had my opportunity with Copland, and actually, the first Rocky was not an action film at all.  It was an ensemble piece. 
[01:49:00]  So, I, at this point, I don't want to experiment anymore with something really that touches, like, for example, Edgar Allan Poe is one I want to direct.  I can't be in it, because I'm too young, and I don't think people hearing Yo Poe would work today.  Sorry.  Was it, was it, was it, was it, was it ever a point where you really tried to go to some class or something to not be, you know, like, to not,  was it ever an attempt for you to just try your best and not be Yo Rocky? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, you know, it, well, I, I, in college, you, you'd almost see the Dias cast.  I, I would go off like many other actors, but I was always cast in a certain role.  There's a perception of body type, the sound of your voice.  So, I was always the villain, the mugger, the fella from the dark side, the, the, the friend that you're, you know, parents don't want you around.  And that just blossomed down, and so when I came to New York, the first couple of roles I ever got, I was like, let's go mug Woody Allen, then you mug Jack Lemmon, then you're the thug here. 
[01:50:00]  With the Lord of Flatbush?  Lord of Flatbush.  So, I thought, why don't I write a part about a guy who's a thug, but underneath the leather, underneath the hat, there beats a different kind of heart, and that's the beginning of Rocky.  He wasn't that in Tango and Cash, though.  That guy, but you know what, I played the wrong role.  Nah, man, Tango and Cash, that was it.  I should have played the Kurt Russell role, let him wear the glasses. 
[01:50:30]  I'm sorry, I really enjoy what people would call your other movies.  Like, I mean, like Rocky, to me, we argue all the time, we argued before, Rocky 3, I'm a black dude, by the way, is my favorite Rocky.  And we argue that, but I think Rocky 1 is everybody's mostly favorite, but I love Lockup, Tango and Cash, Rocky 3, I like the other one.  Night Hawks!  Night Hawks, sure.  But Rocky, my favorite, is one, the last one, and three.  Do you know what I love about Rocky? 
[01:51:00]  When you watch the original Rocky, because obviously it was a lower budget than the other ones, when you pan into the audience a little times, you'll actually see at times empty seats during the championship fight.  Just the nature of doing a film before you're so known, and then you see part two and you watch those scenes, and there's not an empty seat in the house.  I know, it's so true.  We would have people brought in, and we couldn't get any volunteers, and they were going to people, you know, I guess, homeless.  You would get local people on the street, any way you could get it, and they would only stay as long as the free lunches and the chicken boxes. 
[01:51:30]  Once that ran out by noon, you're playing to a house full of crickets.  What's that?  I just wanted to know if you still talk to Carl Weathers.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you still, I mean, it's kind of a corny question, but it's like, we become kind of invested in these characters after all these years, and you associate Rocky with Apollo Creed.  I mean, I assume they hang out every holiday, you know.  No, not really.  It's Carl now and then, and he's walking down the street in Santa Monica, hey, how you doing? 
[01:52:00]  But it's strange.  A lot of actors don't maintain any kind of relationship.  We all sit there and exchange phone numbers and say, you know what, we're going to be buddies, whatever it's called, and have the kids grow up together.  And then, by the time you get home, amnesia.  Yeah, I guess so.  You move on to the next project, and they move on to the next project.  And what is, is there anything you regret doing?  Like, I mean, you've had a tremendous career.  Is there anything that you look back and you're like, maybe, I don't wish I didn't do that, but I kind of wish I did that.  And a turned down role.  Ask about that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Anything you turned down.  Sure, I was going to do coming home, witness, romancing the stone. 
[01:52:30]  I mean, there's many of those.  And I'd end up, you know, interestingly, you sometimes are very, very open to suggestion.  And I think people have to listen to their, really, their inner instincts and their heart.  Half the films I've done today, I would look at today, if they were presented, and say, obviously, this is a cruel joke.  I'm serious.  All right.  They're telling us he's got to go.  He's got a very busy schedule today. 
[01:53:00]  Well, the movie is obviously, where's my stupid one sheet?  Rambo.  It is Rambo.  It's in theaters next Friday, which is January the 25th.  Yeah, I hope you guys enjoy it.  I think it's the best action film I've ever done.  Will you be alive by the end of the film?  Actually, that's the next movie is we try to bring Rambo back from the dead.  Bring back from the dead.  SylvesterStalone.com.  And, you know, it was really a thrill talking to you.  We're really happy that you were able to call in.  Appreciate it.  And continued success.  Good luck with the film.  Yeah, same to you.  Take care.  Thank you. 
[01:53:30]  Same to us in our film.  It was cool, though.  It's amazing.  It was great.  You expect a big star like that to not be conversational.  It's like, oh, yeah, he's Stallone.  He's comfortable.  Very cool.  Very cool.  He gets carpal tunnel syndrome pulling back that arrow in this one.  That was a good one.  Thank you, fan.  We just talked to Rocky.  That's pretty damn impressive, man.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break to the affiliates because we're a mess right now.  I screwed up so bad that we've got to try to figure this out.  So we're going to do a very short break.  Come back, and then we're going to talk for, what, five minutes? 
[01:54:00]  And then we're going to do another break.  And then we're going to get Andrew Morton in studio to talk about his Tom Cruise biography.  Right?  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  If we pull this off, we're going to be what?  Employed.  Employed.  Employed.  We're going to be what?  So, P and Anthony, let's get right back into it.  We've got Andrew Morton in studio.  This guy knows how to write a biography, and his latest one is on Tom Cruise.  Best-selling author.  And he just told me, we had a great chat.  It's disgraceful that this book is not being published in certain places, which I just find disgusting. 
[01:54:30]  It's not being published in Britain, New Zealand, and Australia.  Although the Australians are now, because of the furory around the world, various wholesalers are saying, we're going to start selling it.  We're going to stand up to the legal threats and intimidation from Tom Cruise and Scientology.  And you're not scared of the lawsuits that they're talking about?  Well, look, as you say, I'm a well-known biographer.  I spent two years researching this book.  I knew what I was up against.  And, you know, the people who I've spoken to, you know, they've either signed off on it. 
[01:55:00]  And I'm prepared to stand by the story.  I mean, you know, and the whole thing's been very carefully vetted.  How hard was it to get people to talk to you, especially people in the know about Scientology and the reputation they have, whether it's justified or not?  Well, I mean, it's very interesting.  A lot of them were quite nervous, but it's useful being known.  I mean, I'm known for books I've done on Princess Diana, on Madonna, on Monica Lewinsky, and so on.  So when I ring up, I'm not some kind of stooge for Scientology. 
[01:55:30]  I'm not some private eye.  I'm not somebody trying to do them over.  I'm just, they know they can look me up on the Google and so on.  So it's been very useful to have that.  You've got a reputation behind you, sure.  What is something you found out that you were very surprised at that you think, well, people will become a little bit more?  Because I think people will become very disillusioned with Tom Cruise.  The more you see him, I mean, personally, I see him, and I just think the guy comes off like an ass.  I mean, he really doesn't, we've talked off here, I don't think he's a good spokesperson.  I don't think he seems genuine.  I think he seems very, very pompous and like an arrogant, dumb jock trying to lecture me about something he heard that he thinks is deep. 
[01:56:00]  Now, is this brand new feelings, or is this Oprah Couch feelings?  Yes, the more I got to know about him.  That's going to be the changing point, like Jimmy said earlier.  How did you feel about him during Cocktail and Top Gun days?  No opinion.  I thought he was an underrated actor.  I thought he was an underrated actor, but I thought he was a great actor.  To give him his due, I think he's a very good actor.  Right.  Who's actually been not afraid to take difficult choices, to do things like Magnolia, that film where he was a coach. 
[01:56:30]  I mean, a life coach, rather.  And also, by, well, obviously he was fired by Paramount, but he's now the head of a studio.  He will, he's a very powerful man.  I think Forbes calls him the most powerful celebrity in the world.  And you call him one of the most dangerous celebrities in the world, by the way.  Well, people have called him the most dangerous.  I mean, he is someone who, because of our modern age, because we worship celebrity, as I mentioned earlier, politicians don't get a free pass. 
[01:57:00]  Celebrities do.  And when a celebrity has got a message, and they've got power and authority and a whole organization behind them,  they can make a real difference without ever being questioned.  And all this book does is say, hey, let's examine what he has to say, let's examine his life, and let's examine his beliefs.  And why is Scientology so secretive?  Well, because they've always had quite a lot to hide, in the sense that it's what I would call, it's a bait and switch organization.  They bring you in, and then they never really tell you what it's about. 
[01:57:30]  And then finally you do, when you have to believe in this kind of creationist myth about the evil Lord Zeno and so on.  And they've brought you in for a period of time.  So a lot of it is hidden beneath the surface.  Is that a lot different than believing in, like, Jesus and the Bible and what's in there?  Oh, no. I've got no problem with, I mean, most creationist myths are absurd.  I mean, you know, they don't stand up to any scrutiny.  Because they've been around for a long time, what you've got to ask yourself is, 
[01:58:00]  what are the other philosophies and policies that they're arguing?  I mean, you know, Tom Cruise, as he said publicly, he wants to outlaw and ban psychiatry.  They want to, to use their phrase, globally obliterate psychiatry.  And they want to take over the world's mental health.  And they're trying to do that.  They want to take over education and so on.  So it seems to me entirely sensible and entirely proper to examine these policies and these ideas. 
[01:58:30]  And taking over mental health, that's profitable.  There's a lot of money at stake there.  There's a lot of money at stake.  Sure.  The drug companies and all the rest of it.  I'm sorry.  Are they well-intentioned, like a guy like Miskevich, who's the head of Scientology.  I've seen, I know very little about him.  Is he a guy who's a megalomaniac?  Or is he a guy who really believes in what he's saying and is kind of getting trashed because 
[01:59:00]  Scientology is just the thing to trash?  Well, he's the head of the church.  He joined, his father joined when he was going through a crisis in his life.  And his son became a member pretty early on and left school on the day of his 16th birthday and went into Scientology and has been there ever since.  So he never graduated high school and he's been inside Scientology.  He's a true believer.  The point that they always make is that they have a – and people will have seen that video of Tom Cruise talking about –  We played it yesterday.  When I – we're the only ones who can help at a car crash and so on. 
[01:59:30]  They have – they believe that they have a monopoly of answers to all the world's problems, whatever they are.  They have a monopoly of truth.  And anyone who dares to dispute that is a critic and, by definition, a criminal.  So there's no room for doubt, no room for dissent in that universe.  Has there ever been an outside source that's ever said, you know, Scientology helped us, like, you know, like whatever, the Christian – the wildlife fund or something. 
[02:00:00]  Has there ever been anybody that's ever said Scientology has helped, meaning they give a lot of money, they build schools, they do all kind of stuff?  They do a lot of work to promote themselves and they've opened their own schools, they've opened their own –  No, I mean for, like, for others.  Like, like, outside of their own cause that there's some other people that say, oh, wow, he gave me money for cancer.  Tom Cruise funded a detox center in New York after 9-11 using the Scientology, what they call purification techniques. 
[02:00:30]  But essentially they help themselves.  They help the Scientologists promote their own causes and promote themselves.  Right. Now getting a change of subject, subject to Katie Holmes' baby, there's a lot of rumors that this is associated to Ron L. Hubbard.  Yeah, there was –  L. Ron, L. Ron Hubbard, sorry.  Well, think back to the pregnancy.  It was a real circus, wasn't it? 
[02:01:00]  Tom Cruise bought a sonogram machine, you know, whoever does that to monitor the growth of the fetus.  There was this whole silent birth thing and the big placards and all that debate around that.  Inside Scientology there was – and they, by the way, they deny it – but inside Scientology they do, as I've mentioned earlier, believe in reincarnation.  And there was a belief, a wildfire, almost wishful thinking that L. Ron, because it's 20 years after he died, that somehow the offspring of Tom Cruise would have the spirit of L. Ron inside him. 
[02:01:30]  It's Quato from Toro Rico.  And this, by the way, isn't the first time it's happened. I mean, when L. Ron's daughter Suzette had a baby, the toddler was a boy in ginger hair, like the founder of Scientology, and was followed around one of these secret bases that they have.  There's a secret base –  In the desert, right?  Yeah, and I think you wrote something about how he became – there was a rift between him and Miscovich when he found out – like, the more he learned – was it that he – when he found out about Zeno and their belief in that, that there was a problem between him and the head of the church? 
[02:02:00]  Well, what happens is –  Or maybe you didn't write that or I just heard it.  No, I mean, what happens for most of these people, that you get to a level called operating feet and three, and then you go through what's called the wall of fire.  And the wall of fire is where you're given a folder, you know, clear plastic envelope, and a key, and you send it into a room, and you read this facsimile handwritten story, written by the science fiction writer of L. Ron Hubbard, which basically tells you this creationist myth, which you've seen parodied on South Park. 
[02:02:30]  You know, we all know it, evil Lord Zeno sends all these people to Earth, or T-Jack, as they call it, they're put into volcanoes, nuclear bombs, and they're all killed, and all these spirits, these dead spirits, are roaming around the Earth, and they cover your body.  And to get rid of these spirits, you have to speak to them telepathically.  Now, a lot of people have joined Scientology because there's something wrong in their lives, they've, you know, their marriage has gone wrong, they've got problems with anger, they want to give up smoking, and it helps. 
[02:03:00]  Once you get to this level, you're thinking, hey, space aliens, you know, there's, and so it's a leap of faith.  At this point, it's a leap of faith, because afterwards, what you've got to do is spend your time actually talking to yourself telepathically to get rid of these body thetans.  So, you will go through a process, and this is so weird, you have to do it, and Tom Cruise does this, three or four times a day, and you speak to yourself telepathically, and you talk to these body thetans.  And you say, your first question is, who are you? And they will answer, I'm a dust mite, or I'm Napoleon, or I'm Bill Clinton. 
[02:03:30]  And eventually, once they've said, I am me, or whatever, they recognize themselves, they leave you.  So, you spend a long time getting rid of these body thetans, and clearing your body so that you become clean and cleansed and move forward.  All right, so you've cleared that up, because I always thought it was bizarre, but now that makes perfect sense.  Now, is it, now, I would almost understand in a way, is there, now, are they literally thinking they're talking to spirits, or are they using spirits as a symbolism for personal demons and things like that? 
[02:04:00]  Or are they being literal saying, no, no, no, we really believe that there's a creature in Geno?  You've got these body things that you're cleansing yourself of.  And as people have said to me, who've gone to these levels, you get into quite a euphoric state.  You feel good about yourself, because you put yourself into a light, hypnotic trance.  And then, you know, one pretty outspoken former scientist said to me, he said, you know, you can talk to your thumb, you can talk to your finger, you can talk to your elbow, you can talk to the crack of your ass all day long, but it's not going to make you a Superman. 
[02:04:30]  And once you remember that, once you realize that, you're gone.  And that's the thing, you're in a psychological bubble.  Hey, we're running out of time with Andrew Morton.  You didn't really go into the rumors that Tom Cruise might be a homosexual in the book.  What I read, anyway, I tried to cram.  I felt like I was back in college.  I pulled an all-nighter and tried to read as much as possible.  But what I read, it seems like you believe that he's heterosexual. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, I deal with that pretty extensively, because the first question I'm always asked is, is he gay?  And I've come up with an emphatic, he's always been a ladies' man.  And he finally got married, aged 11, in a schoolyard in Ottawa to his local sweetheart, who signed her name Maypother,  which was his given name.  But, you know, he's sued regularly people who have said that he's gay.  Now, I've spoken to the legal people who've actually had him in chambers, who've spoken to him, 
[02:05:30]  and he's been prepared to go on oath and say, I'm not gay.  You know, I've never had a gay experience.  And ironically, though, the fact that he's sued so often, he's added fuel to the flames.  And these days, who cares?  That's probably just a very egotistical guy who doesn't like things being, as opposed to, he's probably not covering up gay rumors,  he's just an arrogant dude, he doesn't like things being said about him.  And he wants to make sure that nobody says, but then again, I wouldn't want that either, so I can't even fall to that. 
[02:06:00]  What's the church's view on that? The Scientology Church, do they have a view on that?  Yeah, they do.  Well, L. Ron Hubbard says that all homosexuals, if they don't convert to Scientology,  should be, to quote him, disposed of quietly and without sorrow.  With the Star Trek phases.  So, yeah, but he never said, he doesn't tell you the methods to do it.  But, in actual fact, he was, in the early days, he was marketed as being able to, quote, cure you of homosexuality. 
[02:06:30]  And I've spoken to one guy who spent half a million dollars trying to cure himself of being gay.  Got to the highest level, realized he was still gay.  So he sued the church for his money back.  Wow.  Nice.  And they had to send 30 men to have sex with them.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm going to buy Dianetics for you, Norton.  Why?  I'm not gay.  Does Trannix make you gay?  Let's hope not.  Scientology would scratch their head looking at me.  We don't know what this thing is.  We can't figure this one out.  Andrew Moore, a best-selling biographer. 
[02:07:00]  The book is called Tom Cruise, An Unauthorized Biography.  If you go in and just say, I want the Tom Cruise book, they're going to know exactly what you mean.  Oh, yeah.  And the parts I've read of it, it's really, it's a well-written, it's not just a trash fest.  It's a great read.  I believe what I've read.  And it just is a really well-put-together work, and I wish you a lot of luck.  Yeah, it was nice meeting you.  Nice to talk to you, guys.  It was nice meeting you.  Let's just leave the building separately, then.  Yes.  Because we don't have Kevlar suits on like you do.  Yeah.  So, all right, guys.  We're heading out, right?  Yes.  I don't know what we're doing next. 
[02:07:30]  We might go over to XM.  We might not.  We've got to figure it out.  Andrew Morton, thank you so much.  Patrice, thank you so much.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony. </pre>
