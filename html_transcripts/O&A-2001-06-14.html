<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment commemorating the anniversary of the O.J. Simpson trial, which the hosts credited with inspiring their show's creation.  This led to the playing of a parody song, "Gonna Electric Shock O.J.," by Anthony's brother Joe's band, Rotgut, along with its music video.  Other parodies by Joe, using the Patty Duke Show theme, were also played, covering subjects such as the Olsen twins, the Bush twins, and the Columbine High School shooters.  The hosts announced their upcoming judging duties at Kid Rock's Babe Fest.

A caller, Mike from Survivor 2, described being pepper-sprayed by an angry fan upset about his killing of a boar on the show.  He also discussed the aftermath of his appearance, including reactions from other contestants and unusual fan encounters.  The show then extensively covered Lola, a listener from a previous "honey and feathers" stunt, who recounted being disowned by her family and losing her job as a result.  Attempts to contact Lola's mother to reconcile were unsuccessful.  The hosts then transitioned to preparing for the arrival of Ziggy, a homeless man from a previous "Homeless Shopping Spree" segment.

Ziggy arrived in the studio, noticeably cleaner and thinner, claiming five months of sobriety after a stay in a Brooklyn hospital.  His past struggles with homelessness and alcoholism were discussed, interspersed with crude humor and sexually suggestive comments directed at both Ziggy and Brittany, a guest from *Big Brother*.  A heated phone call from Pat ensued, criticizing the hosts' treatment of Ziggy's alcoholism. This devolved into a contentious argument involving accusations of intoxication directed at Pat. The conversation also touched upon Brittany's virginity, a suggestion that Ziggy and Brittany hook up, and further sexually suggestive jokes.  Jay Moore (a Hollywood actor) and Eddie (winner of *Big Brother*) also made brief appearances.  The segment concluded with promotions for a bar and a song, "F Your Sister" by Stephen Lynch.


The next segment focused heavily on Brittany from *Big Brother*, featuring a highly sexually explicit conversation about her sexual experiences (or lack thereof, as she claimed to be a 26-year-old virgin), and her use of various objects for masturbation.  This was punctuated by vulgar jokes and numerous callers, including "Drunk Pat" from Philly offering sexual advice, the "Slipknot Guy" from a previous show, and "Stalker Patty," a 46-year-old virgin.  The conversation wandered to topics including Jay Moore, various celebrities (George Carlin, Adam Sandler), sports, and random anecdotes.  A call from a possibly injured and disoriented man was also aired.  The hosts promoted Ultimate V and gave away Radiohead tickets. Jay Moore remained in the studio.


The final segment included in-studio guests Jay Moore, Brittany, and comedian Richard Jeni, along with numerous Sam Adams beer commercials.  The conversation centered on Jay Moore's appearances on *Regis and Kelly*, contrasting his on-air persona with his off-air material, leading to sexually explicit discussions.  A running gag involved Richard Jeni repeatedly being disconnected from the show by Opie or Jay. Ziggy returned to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" with Opie and Anthony. Other topics included a singer being booed off stage in Philadelphia and listener calls. The show concluded with promotions for Stacker 2 diet pills and a final, unsuccessful attempt to connect with Richard Jeni.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Jesus Christ, this is despicable.  Harry Sack with ya.  I like doing oral on my dog.  I just want an erection so I can give it to my mom.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Phone number, toll free, 877-692-1027.  And of course here in New York, 212-757-1027.  What's up, Anthony?  How you doing?  I love that O.J. bit.  O.J. never gets old, man.  Nice.  Nice. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, it's very nice.  He's in the news all the time.  And I am fascinated by everything he does.  Didn't we just pass the anniversary of the whole mess?  Yeah, that was a couple days ago.  How many years ago was that?  Seven?  95?  94.  That's right.  Seven years ago.  Seven long years.  And look, I'm still fascinated by the whole thing.  That means we've been hanging for seven years.  Yes.  Anthony and I got together because of the O.J. thing. 
[00:01:00]  If O.J. hadn't killed two people, yeah, we wouldn't have this radio show.  We'll figure that out.  You know, I think I got the song that you sent into my radio show at the time.  Oh, really?  That started it all.  Started this mess we call the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years?  I've been here for seven years.  Do you want to play the song?  Yeah, you know, of course it's seven years old and it's very, very dated now, but this 
[00:01:30]  is...  I actually, you know, when I penned this, O.P., I was under the impression that O.J. would  be given the death penalty.  Yeah.  I mean, everybody was.  There wasn't a chance in hell that this guy wasn't going to be found guilty and maybe go  to the, put on death row and put to death.  But, um, oops, as we all know, it didn't work out that way, so in that respect, the song's 
[00:02:00]  a little dated.  We were hoping that he was going to get the electric chair or something.  And that's what the song was about.  And at the time, I mean, the case was so huge, I just asked all the local bands to send in  songs to the radio program.  This was when O.P. was out on Long Island.  Yes.  At B.A.B. doing a show, Seven to Midnight, by himself.  Right.  And, um, me and my brother put this song together, sent it in to O.P., and he played  it.  I was very thrilled.  I got to tell you, I used to drive around, and I'd listen to O.P.'s show, and he's playing  one of my songs, and I'm like, wow, this is cool. 
[00:02:30]  I'm on the radio.  And now you just hate me.  Because I was in construction and stuff, so it was kind of a thrill to just hear something  you did on the radio.  I think we explained all this to 2020 Downtown yesterday.  Yeah, they asked how we hooked up.  As part of our two-and-a-half-hour interrogation.  Interrogation, yes, that they gave us yesterday.  And, yeah, that's your story, if anyone gives a crap about how we hooked up.  Right.  And it was all because of O.J. and the O.J. song, because then O.P. invited me and Joe, 
[00:03:00]  me and my brother, down to perform it live.  And me and O.P. started talking and kind of clicked, you know?  Had me come in and comment on some news, and a couple of times a week I'd come in, and  before I knew it, he said, hey.  Yeah, I didn't care.  I really didn't care.  I wanted to get into radio.  So, it is funny to listen to the song seven years later, because, like you just said a  little while ago, everyone was convinced that he would get the death penalty for killing  two people.  He killed two people, and everyone knew it. 
[00:03:30]  They still know it.  Right.  So, here's the song.  It's called, Gonna Electric Shock O.J.  Flashback.  I'm sitting in Los Angeles jail, and you just won't let me post my pill.  Now, this could be the end of me, because California's got that death penalty. 
[00:04:00]  They're gone, Electric Shock O.J., cook my behind like a chicken croquette.  They're gone, Electric Shock O.J., toast my behind.  Nicole, I really loved that girl, but she had the worst look in the world.  I was only cleaning my knife. 
[00:04:30]  I accidentally spent for 36 times.  They're gone, Electric Shock O.J., cook my behind like that cherry floppy.  They're gone, Electric Shock O.J., roast my behind.  Looks like I'm a guilty man.  Loved like a whip, now I'm gonna have to love my hand. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, what's worse, won't make me flip my lips.  I hear my congestion is washing my tears.  Oh, I know they cut me so slack.  I'm an athlete, movie star, and I'm black.  My lawyers argue over my head.  My baby woman of that electric hotel.  They're gone, Electric Shock O.J., cook my behind like a flounder fillet. 
[00:05:30]  They're gone, Electric Shock O.J., roast my behind.  What?  Oh, I didn't do nothing.  Oh, that hurts.  Hurry, give me a car.  Get me the hell out of here.  Ah, whoo, I wouldn't even do that. 
[00:06:00]  Ah, whoo, cut my hand.  Wait, my hand's turning.  Woo.  Yeah, what?  What?  Electric Shock O.J.  There you have it.  From seven years ago, Anthony and his band, Rotgut.  Yes.  Yes.  Wait, your brother's on the phone, Brother Joe.  Joe.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, man?  Joe playing guitar on that one.  I'm getting all teary.  Yeah, Joe on guitar on that one.  Yeah.  Thank you, Joe.  You know what?  You forgot to mention, you totally forgot to mention the fact that there's a video that 
[00:06:30]  goes along with that song.  There was, yes.  We actually made a video to that.  And you know what?  If you have it.  If you have it, give it to Steve C. He's got to put that on Foundry.  You will laugh your ass off.  I know.  I know.  You will laugh your ass off.  Remember producing that thing?  Producing.  It was a drunken weekend in the apartment.  I know.  I'll get a copy of it, and I'll give it to Steve next time I'm in.  Cool, man.  Hey, just think.  If you guys did that song today, it would have been done to the Patty Duke theme. 
[00:07:00]  You know, you guys are such a big part of my asses.  I swear to God, there were three songs that I did to the Patty Duke theme, and the only  reason is because it busted my ass putting it together from scratch.  Here's Joe with another parody to Patty Duke theme.  Yes, sirree.  Here's Joe's song to Patty Duke. 
[00:07:30]  Why didn't you use it yesterday?  Come on, it's hysterical.  Yeah, we forgot to play his Mary-Kate and Ashley song.  Well, we can play it right now.  Because it was their 15th birthday yesterday.  Give me all of Brother Joe's Patty Duke theme parody songs.  Patty Duke theme song retrospective. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, with Joe.  And don't forget the other two when Paul decides to get married.  All right.  All right.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right, you knuckleheads later.  Later.  This is the latest one?  This is the Olsen twins' birthday song?  Yeah, this is...  For the Olsen twins.  They're 15 years old now.  Happy birthday yesterday.  Three years.  Legitimate.  Legal.  Threesome.  15 years old now.  Here's Mary-Kate.  She likes distant flicks. 
[00:08:30]  And Barbie dolls.  And Fogo sticks.  But Ashley is a little slut.  She likes your mommy in the clutch.  Love them portaflicks.  They're the Olsen.  Adolescent vixens all the way.  They will give up their high mans.  Some lucky guy one day.  While Mary-Kate likes to play knock-knock.  And hide in a seat.  And sing a line. 
[00:09:00]  Well, Ashley is the one who goes so glad.  They take a ball of clothes.  For the money shot.  They're the Olsen.  Identical vixens.  And you'll find.  They laugh like.  They laugh like.  I bet they'll even f*** the light.  And you know they'll be tight.  The Olsen.  Take them from behind.  You know, even though it's to the Patty Duke theme, that's having been funny. 
[00:09:30]  That's really funny.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  An old friend is outside the studio.  Keep him out there for a few minutes.  We have to leave an effle.  We haven't seen him in a year and a half.  Holy ass.  I hate not being able to see through that door.  It's Ziggy.  Oh, Ziggy's here?  Yeah.  It's Ziggy.  Hold on, though, Keith.  In the middle of something here.  Oh, that's going to be good.  We'll tell you all about Ziggy in a minute.  Ziggy.  Great.  A lot of the people from New York don't even know who Ziggy is.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  So that's Brother Joe's latest creation done to the Patty Duke theme song. 
[00:10:00]  He can't get enough of the Patty Duke theme song.  Last week, he did one to the Bush Twins.  The Bush Twins.  The Bush Daughter.  Right.  Here's Baru who likes a social drink.  Sip champagne, white or pink.  But Janice would have a clear chase that with a keg of beer. 
[00:10:30]  They're crunches, party snakes.  They're the Bushes.  First family luscious and you'll find.  They love a shot.  And when somebody calls the cops, daddy pays all their fines. 
[00:11:00]  They're the Bushes.  And they love getting light.  All right.  All right.  There's song number two done to the Patty Duke theme song from Brother Joe.  How many more are there?  One more.  Oh, and this one, it was the one that started it all.  This one started the trend.  The Columbine one.  I got to go on record and say that Brother Joe, very talented.  We're just busting on him.  Just busting on him.  He's using the Patty Duke theme a little too much, but that's okay. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And this one?  This next song started it all.  The Patty Duke theme trend.  Yes.  If you're easily offended, I'm going to tell you right now to turn off your radio.  This was part of the most offensive song contest.  Right.  And it's about the two guys that shot up the high school.  Columbine.  Right.  Yeah.  This was for the one year anniversary.  Yeah.  If you're offended, turn off your radio.  I'm telling you.  Don't listen to this.  Brother Joe.  Go on. 
[00:12:00]  Here's still a new light, an M-16 with high-capacity magazines.  But Eric liked to go to the Bonds and B's and Al and Little Tons.  What a crazy pair.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains all the way.  Shot up their school in Trent's Coast.  One year ago today.  While Dylan picked out a chocolate spick.  An effing Jew or some religious chick. 
[00:12:30]  Well, Eric looked out of control.  Shot up some gaming holes.  What a couple of pricks.  They were killers.  Yes, iconic villains that you'll find.  They walked alike and lost and they wound up too tight.  And they took their own lives.  They were killers.  Through set, Columbine.  It's kind of funny to hear all three. 
[00:13:00]  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  I'm sure there'll be more.  I'm looking forward to the fourth one.  Of course.  From the collection.  Yes, Ray.  And remember, the fourth one is always live.  Yeah, easy.  A foreplay weekend.  Fourth Cut is always live.  Not a whole play weekend, yeah.  Very funny.  Bob from Philly checking in saying, stop playing the music.  We want our effing talk.  Smart answer.  Yeah, that's pretty funny. 
[00:13:30]  877-692-1027 is our phone number.  That's toll free.  Steve, what's going on?  Yo, what's happening, guys?  Hey, man.  I can tell you're calling from Philly just by your accent.  My accent?  I'm from New York, baby.  I listened to you from the beginning.  Nice.  Nicey-nice.  I don't hear much New York in there.  Oh, well, I'm from the other border.  Jersey, New York, it's all the same.  Come on.  All right.  What's up, Steve?  I just wanted to say, man, when are you guys coming to visit down here?  I got my wow truck all ready to go to visit you boys.  Well, no one's really going to care, but we're going to make our first visit to Philly a week from today. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, well, listen.  Shout out to all them women.  Look out for the red truck.  We're going to be at Babe Fest.  Nice.  Definitely.  Hosted by Kid Rock.  Slash's band is going to play.  And I think we're going to be judges for the thing, Ant.  Yeah.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  I'm a little apprehensive.  Why?  I usually like waiting.  Oh, I know.  Until you get a few more fans before we actually go into the market.  You know what I mean? 
[00:14:30]  It's only been a week.  We're going down.  I know.  See, because we're insane.  We're absolutely insane.  You guys will be number one inside of a month down here.  And it would be very cool to go there to check it out.  That's what I wanted to do.  Right.  But now what?  We're supposed to be judges?  Yeah, but we just sit there and check out gorgeous ladies.  No.  Opie.  What?  Opie, you're not thinking ahead.  What?  The second I heard judges, all I'm hearing is this.  And let's introduce our judges for this evening. 
[00:15:00]  Right?  Mm-hmm.  You get what I'm getting at?  Yeah, they're going to all boo us.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then, and brand new to WISP, Opie and Anthony.  Boo!  Die!  Boo!  Die!  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  It's okay, though.  Remember, they threw tomatoes at Melissa, and she's hot.  So we don't stand the snowball's chance at hell.  Maybe we could get, like, the chicken net from the Blues Brothers around us.  Yeah.  We're the good old boys. 
[00:15:30]  Chicken wire, yeah.  Steve, yeah, we'll be down there next week.  All right, man.  Look forward to seeing you.  Right on, man.  Later.  Cool.  All right, we have to take a break.  We're just getting started.  Yes, just rolling it out.  Let me tell you, if you heard yesterday's show, the lovely Lola getting tarred and feathered  with honey and feathers.  Feathers.  There are some hilarious pictures up on WNEW.com.  Yeah, you can actually see her choking.  Yeah, yeah.  Just go to the Opie and Anthony section.  That is really funny. 
[00:16:00]  Steve from foundrymusic.com has some video of the whole thing, but the problem is, I  don't know where the video is on the site.  I was trying to find it today, and I couldn't figure it out, so.  And we have an update on Lola.  No, I know.  We're going to talk to Lola next.  I guess, uh, I guess, uh, she's in a bit of trouble after yesterday's show.  Oh, no.  So we'll let you in on that in just a few minutes.  And, yeah, Ziggy.  We get to talk to Ziggy next.  Our homeless friend.  What is he doing out there, Ben? 
[00:16:30]  Did he go out there to check him out?  Tired now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's reading a newspaper last time.  Hey, Keith, the cop.  What's going on?  Actually, he's in the bathroom.  I hope he's not taking a crunch.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That bathroom, let me explain something.  That bathroom is not meant for crunching.  It is a urine-only bathroom because there's no ventilation fan.  There's no windows here.  So it fills the whole lobby area up with a stench.  I think Graywolf did the same thing as soon as he came in.  I guess they're homeless.  They get into a building.  The first thing they do is they go to crunch.  Oh, that's like, that would be like if any of us went to the St. Regis, 
[00:17:00]  a five-star hotel here in Manhattan, and walked into the palatial bathroom there.  Our bathroom to them, they used to like a mayonnaise jar or something.  Or just a subway.  He hasn't been out yet, so I think he might be crunching.  I didn't tell him he couldn't.  I forgot.  Isn't that funny when a cop wears a Sopranos shirt?  I'm just laughing.  Like a cop is wearing a Sopranos shirt.  Keith, is he sober these days?  He's actually been sober for about six weeks.  He'll tell you all about it.  It's hysterical.  Does he want a nice cold Sam Adams? 
[00:17:30]  I don't know if he'll take it, but...  Let's try to get him back off the wagon.  Get some Sam Adams.  He hasn't drank in six weeks?  He's been good.  Get him some Jägermeister.  Yeah, he hasn't been drinking.  Is he still homeless?  He actually stays up on a shelter.  Oh, he does?  I don't know, though.  I see him in my neighborhood sometimes, and I'm like, Ziggy, Ben.  He always looks like he got his ass kicked the night before.  Meditations don't work.  Stinky?  Yes.  Well, what's up?  I've seen him, too, and he'll be, like, standing up against the doorway, you know, with the 
[00:18:00]  one-arm lean.  He doesn't look sober.  And it's recently.  Stinky, get the bar from our office down to the studio.  Maybe it's just medication.  Yeah, we're going to tempt him with some alcohol today.  The medications don't work.  Oh, there he is.  One more call, and then we've got to take a break.  Colleen.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, you're on the radio.  Okay.  What's up?  Let's go.  I just want to tell you guys that the Barbara and Laura Bush song is the funniest thing I've  ever heard.  You like the Joe's parody to the Patty Duke theme? 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  I'm from the Philadelphia area.  You guys rock.  Oh, thank you, Colleen.  We appreciate that.  My boyfriend turned me on to you guys up in New York, and ever since, I've been trying  to wait for you guys to come down here.  Right on.  We have just begun, so thank you.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  We should take a break, Anthony.  We have an ID from Jesse Jackson, too.  How the hell did we get that?  From our new friends in Philadelphia, helping us make things happen.  Just goes to show you Jesse Jackson has no clue who we are. 
[00:19:00]  It's pretty funny.  We'll get into that next.  Yes, sir.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Anthony.  Fidelity Diamond back with the program.  Fidelity Diamond.

Minutes from Manhattan and Rockland County.  Fidelity Diamond, 201-261-6555.  O.P.  Anthony.  107.  W.M.E.W.  And I have to find.  I got my hash pipe. 
[00:20:30]  That's a great song.  We use our hash pipe.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Blank pipe.  Asterisk pipe.  MTV.  It's such pussies.  We don't want to have any drug words on our channel.  They're really doing that with that song?  Yeah, they don't even say hash pipe.  It's not even spelled out.  It's like four asterisks and then a pipe. 
[00:21:00]  And then they don't say the word hash.  What do they do?  Just silence it out or something?  Yeah, they silence it out.  But you know the funniest thing about this?  The record label pays for advertising and it says hash pipe in the commercial on MTV.  Yeah, on the commercial it says it.  And when they performed it live at the, what was that, the movie awards?  Yeah.  They were able to do that without us blanking it out or anything.  Oh, God.  Pretty wanky.  All right, Anthony, we got one of our survivor friends on the hotline here.  Michael!  Hey, how are you guys? 
[00:21:30]  Mike, how you been, man?  We want to know how you are today.  My God.  You want to explain to everyone, Anthony?  Well, it seems somebody didn't like what Mike did on Survivor 2 when he killed that boar for food.  And he's still paying for it.  Some nut sprayed him in the face with pepper spray.  The worst part is I had two little kids next to me and a mom in the background.  They got pepper sprayed, too.  But this guy had a sealed letter.  And he asked me to sign it.  And when he walked up to me, he just blasted me right in the eyes with this thing. 
[00:22:00]  And, boy, that thing just blinded me.  I'm laying on the ground, you know, just totally blind.  And he's crouching over me asking people in line to take pictures of himself with me on the grounds.  Oh, did anyone snap any?  No, nobody would.  And finally, I read the letter about a half hour later, and it said, you know,  he didn't associate himself with any animal rights group or PETA or anything like that.  And he said his message was anti-violence. 
[00:22:30]  Anti-violence.  So he sprays you in the face with pepper spray to get the anti-violence message.  You know, I want to tell the guy there's something missing in the delivery of that message.  Yeah, I think it's a little screwy.  What appearance were you at?  I'm with Missouri Employers Mutual doing a, this is ironic, I'm doing WorkSafe Week.  WorkSafe Week.  I'm promoting safety in the workbook.  Oh, man.  So, you know, I guess this guy had been in trouble with the police before for talking to trees and different things like that. 
[00:23:00]  So they finally put him behind bars.  And, you know, it was just one of those things that, you know, you just, you never know.  There's a sicko out there somewhere.  Yeah, like, what's worse, fire in the face or pepper spray?  What hurts more?  I tell you, I tell you, it felt like my face was back in the fire.  That stuff is, that stuff.  I mean, I can see how that would render an attacker, you know, pretty, pretty helpless.  You know, it's kind of weird in a way.  Like, everybody kind of wants to know what that would feel like.  So now you know.  I'll never forget. 
[00:23:30]  Really bad.  You know, people are talking about the pig, and I've got to tell you guys, when the world saw that wild pig run into the coochie camp,  I saw a giant pork chop running into the coochie camp.  Yeah, we supported you on that one.  It's food.  We're humans.  Jesus Christ.  Get over it.  Top of the food chain, people.  We're allowed.  Now, Mike, did anyone kick this guy's ass for doing that to you?  You know, it's interesting.  There's mostly a lot of women around, and, you know, you look at, you know, 10 years ago, you know, 
[00:24:00]  who knows that I would have popped a guy or something, you know.  It's, you know, it's just one guy.  Obviously, the guy's passionate about some issue, and I don't even know if I ever know the issue,  but he said in his letter, he said, I want to stick around.  I want to get arrested.  I know I'm going to get in trouble, but if I don't get arrested, then my name won't get in the paper,  and nobody will know who I am.  Son of a bitch.  A nutty stalker.  No, who it was?  It was Cal.  It was Cal.  He got voted off the island so early, he wanted his fame to continue.  Are you thinking about getting a bodyguard? 
[00:24:30]  I mean, you're kind of the most controversial member of Survivor 2,  and you've got people that don't like what you did.  Yeah, I know, you know, I know that I had gotten, there was some heat with some animal rights group at first.  They actually investigated it, and they actually got the raw footage of the, you know, unedited pig hunt,  which is about two and a half hours long.  Oh, pig hunt.  Okay.  They actually determined that it was for, I mean, even the animal rights groups have backed off once they did the investigation.  So, you know, I mean, I've spoken to over a quarter million people live and exposed myself to the public, 
[00:25:00]  and, you know, I hate to have, you know, one incident in 250,000, you know, change the way that I do think.  But it has made me a little more aware of what could happen.  Hey, Mike, you know, did you, I'm sure you sat down and thought about it afterwards.  That could have been a gun.  You know, you want to hear something really crazy?  So he has me in a sealed envelope, so I'm like, I'm thinking, be aware of sealed envelopes.  The next day, I'm just two towns over, and this lady comes up to me with a sealed envelope. 
[00:25:30]  Everybody's watching this lady.  And then she had her arms crossed.  When she uncrossed her arms, she had a shirt on that said, United Postal Workers.  Oh, great.  And I'm like, cape on, eye on this lady.  Now you're going to get gun shy and just start punching people in the face with sealed envelopes.  You should.  Mike, the lady.  I did go get my bulletproof vest, and, you know, I'm preparing for my next public appearance.  Man.  Mike, the lady's just loving you when you're doing these public appearances?  You know, it's interesting.  I came out with a book, and 87% of my book sales were women. 
[00:26:00]  But we did this appearance with all 16 survivors two weeks ago in New York, and we were promoting, you know, next year's lineup.  And all the girls went over to one little place to get their picture taken, and all the guys went over to another place.  Well, there was about 600 people at this party.  There was 300 men in front of the girls getting their picture taken, and there was 300 women in front of the guys.  I mean, it's interesting how the, you know, the war of the sexes and the men versus women thing just is, it's, it's, it's, from the beginning of time, it'll always be. 
[00:26:30]  Mike, how bad do you want to bang some of these ladies that are coming up to you at these appearances?  You know, it's just a young guy.  Well, you're human.  Come on.  You know, yeah.  We're not saying anything that's outrageous.  It's window shopping.  You know, I'm a happily married guy, and, you know, it's, uh.  Hey, I hear they're easier to get if you hit them in the face with pepper spray.  They go, they go right down, Mike.  You know, it worked.  Somebody came up to me and told me that she had pepper spray on her key chain, and her one-year-old child was biting on it, and it went off while her one-year-old child hit her in the face, hit the one-year-old in the face. 
[00:27:00]  I mean, that stops.  That's like a time bomb, man.  I mean, I just, I guess police officers have to get sprayed in the face as part of their training.  Oh, do they do?  Yeah.  What happened to the people next to you now?  There was women and children.  Did they just start hacking and?  Yeah, I mean, even if you spray it on your arm, I mean, it is unbelievably toxic.  It burns for about two hours, and it just goes away.  Yeah, if you spray it in a room, people in the room, even if they're not near it, will start tearing and really get in front of you.  I opened my mouth in kind of surprise, and so I actually had a chance to taste it, too. 
[00:27:30]  It does not taste like pepper.  No, no.  It's not nice like pepper.  Mike, did you see Amber on the cover of Stuff Magazine yet?  I heard, and I was doing some radio this morning, and I saw, you know, they were flashing through it, and I got a message from Tina about five minutes ago.  And Tina said, boy, Amber didn't have a lot of nice things to say about me in that article.  Did she dog out Tina?  You know what?  Who read the article?  We just looked at the goddamn pictures. 
[00:28:00]  Mike, she is so hot in that.  Like, she's pretty plain looking, very attractive, but she's very plain looking.  She came in yesterday, and she didn't have makeup on.  They made her up like some kind of hoo-ah, and it looked really nice.  What did Tina say that Amber said about her?  She goes, Tina didn't have a lot of nice things to say, and then she went, rawr.  Really?  So, you know, I don't know.  I guess there's that little rivalry.  I didn't really know it was a little rivalry, but, I mean, I guess she must have done something out there.  I guess it would be broken a line, you know, picking her and Jerry off. 
[00:28:30]  But, yeah, I did see that Amber was in Detroit last week doing an appearance for us, and she just is.  She's the sweetest thing.  I mean, she just does.  I just would love to see her.  I would love to watch her at a public appearance because she just doesn't have any idea.  I thought you were going to say, I would love to see her naked.  Well, yeah.  God.  Hey, Mike, you know what married guy Kimmy had sex with?  I heard a little rumor, but I don't think it's true.  Really? 
[00:29:00]  We had Kimmy on yesterday, and...  No, it's not true with Kevin James.  We finally figured out who it is.  No, I'm thinking Kevin James was true also.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She didn't deny the Kevin James thing.  They went to school together, you know, from the King of Queens.  She did not deny that?  No.  They went to school together, so it was probably years ago.  You mean the big guy?  Yeah.  I'll tell you, I met those two when I went to New York, you know, that feisty little girl  from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  I mean, they're so...  I never watched the show, and I've just kind of...  I get seen it a couple times, but she is a feisty little girl, man. 
[00:29:30]  She's a big fan of the show, and she gave Kel a real hard time.  You know, Kel's just not the best people person.  No, he's not at all.  It's just not, and she just, like, sitting right next to him, she just turned her chair  the other way and, like, held her hand up in front of his face while she addressed everybody  else, and she had something to say about everybody, what everybody did right or what everybody  did wrong on the show, and it was really interesting to hear her talking.  That Kevin James guy just sat in the back and was just smiling, and he was all nice.  Mike, I've got to tell you, half the fun of Survivor is watching how all the different 
[00:30:00]  personalities react after the show's over.  And they have the celebrity now, and going around just doing interviews or handling rumors.  It's so entertaining to watch how some of the people, how the different personalities deal  with those things.  Like, you're a natural, you know?  You're very personable.  You come on the radio.  You're open.  You talk.  Some people are a lot more shy.  They don't have the same sense of humor, maybe.  You know, we have Kimmy come in, and she's willing.  She's taking her clothes off.  She's having fun. 
[00:30:30]  She'll do anything for us.  And then yesterday, you know, we had Amber on, and, you know, she's completely not.  Yeah, she was petrified of us yesterday.  Yeah, it is funny.  You know, people always say, you know, can I bring up, I mean, come on, we won't talk  about the pepper spray.  I won't talk about the pig kill.  I'm like, come on, if you can't have fun with this.  I mean, I think that's the whole thing.  You know, people just get so uptight about, you can't make fun of yourself.  I mean, you know, it's, I think a lot of people define their life by this show.  Like, this is what defines my life. 
[00:31:00]  And to me, it's just, you know, it's one of the things you did.  It was really cool.  We got to do some cool stuff, and, you know, I'm on to the next thing.  Right.  Yeah, a lot of people have to really think about it before they get into it, you know,  that you're going to be a celebrity, you know?  We never knew that.  I've got to tell you that I'd never watched it.  Wait, wait, wait, Mike.  You had to know.  I mean, the first cast, I would believe that, but you knew what you were in store.  You know, I'd never watched the show.  The first part?  And I applied for the show after the fourth show of the first Survivor. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  Nobody had done an appearance or a guest spot or an ad or a movie or anything.  And when I went to do the show, my kid talked me down.  The local theater had a casting call.  I was filling out the application and said, you know, who are you most liked from the first show?  And I said, sorry, I never watched your show.  And what would you have done in this situation?  Sorry, I never watched your show.  And after about five of those questions, I thought it was a kiss of death.  And finally there was a question.  He said, if you were president of the United States, what would you change about this world?  And I said, the length of this application.  And I just kept answering questions like that. 
[00:32:00]  And when it got to the video, I saw a TV account.  I thought they were going to interview me.  And I stood in front of a blue background.  And he said, start talking.  He got three minutes.  And I said, about what?  So at the beginning of my interview, I said, about what?  And he pointed to his watch and he rolled his finger.  And, you know, I said everything wrong.  I mean, everything I said had nothing to do with the show.  And it was quite obvious I had never seen the show before.  Now, as the interview process went on, I became more familiar with the show.  But, I mean, I really did not have any idea.  I don't think anything can prepare you for what really, I think the third show they know, 
[00:32:30]  because everybody's been doing everything.  But, I mean, I don't think anybody can really prepare you for what really happens when you get off the show.  Yeah, like getting pepper spray in the face.  Gosh, I've got nothing.  I only got, Tina's the only one, you know, Tina and Keith, two people that I'm sure everybody's heard about.  But Tina and Keith, and I see Mark Burnett called, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, no, you're all over the post today, all over the media in New York.  Yeah.  All right.  They got that picture of you poking your head out of the lake in pain, you know.  That's one thing that will just follow you everywhere.  Yeah, that is the picture, you know. 
[00:33:00]  Great.  All right, Mike.  I've got to send the press a new photo, an updated photo.  Yeah, really.  Get a new photo.  All right, we've got to wrap up, man.  Hey, do you guys still have that Kel interview on your website?  Oh, the Kel one?  That's still a classic.  Brutal.  Anybody listening out there that has not heard the Kel interview, you have not lived until you've heard the Kel interview.  Yeah, where is the Kel interview these days?  All we talked about was how he was pleasuring himself in the outback, and he finally hung up on us.  He finally hung up on us, yeah.  It was cool.  You guys have been, you know, you guys have been, I've been a big fan of yours ever since that, you know, your producer called. 
[00:33:30]  I'm like, I've called you guys right back.  It seems like I've been a big fan of your show ever since.  Well, if you ever make it to New York, please stop by and say hi.  Well, I'm supposed to come in next week and do the CBS early show with Brian and James.  We would love to have you on.  Stop in in the afternoon.  Yeah.  All right, man.  I'll give you guys a call.  All right.  Hold on.  Rick will talk to you real fast.  Okay.  We're dead serious.  Hold on.  There he goes.  Cool.  There's Mike from Survivor 2.  Got pepper sprayed in the face. 
[00:34:00]  Damn.  I don't understand how they just, they can't just go around like that.  Somebody that has some kind of controversy going on.  Mm-hmm.  On TV, that widespread.  I mean, there's too many kooks.  Ah, kook.  Well, let me see if Lola's going to hang.  Lola.  Hey, guys.  Can we talk to you right after the next break?  Sure.  Are you okay?  Yeah, well, I'm having a rough day.  I know.  You're going to give us the update from yesterday?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  No problem.  That's Lola, who got torn and feathered yesterday, and, uh, oof. 
[00:34:30]  Yee.  Some people aren't happy with her.  Ah.  Today.  They're a little pissed off.  Should we play something going into break here?  Yeah, why not?  Uh, I wasn't prepared to play anything.  Lay him well off something before the Marshalls.  Give him a little something, something.  A little something, something.  What you got over there?  Uh, I wasn't prepared, so.  Ah, we'll just go to break, okay?  And we'll talk to Lola next.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.

[00:37:00]  Lola.  Was the star of the show yesterday, Anthony.  Well, you drink champagne.  Yes, she was.  Black gold can't hold.  She, uh, she came in yesterday.  And for Backstreet Boy tickets.  It was during our Mommy What Would You Do for Backstreet Boy tickets contest.  God, I can't believe we were giving away Backstreet Boy tickets.  But she said, um, we could pour honey all over her body and cover her in feathers.  Sort of a tar and feather thing without the tar.  So, she comes in. 
[00:37:30]  Gets doused with honey.  Does it.  She's completely naked.  Except for a wow sticker over her, uh, area.  Over her hatchet wound.  Right.  And, uh, the way that we put the feathers on her, it was great.  I thought, end of story.  Now, pictures are up on WNEW.com.  They're hilarious.  Just go to the Opie and Anthony section.  And some stuff is on FoundryMusic.com. 
[00:38:00]  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y Music.com to check out what you heard yesterday.  And, well, Lola is on the, on the line, Anthony.  Lola.  Hi, guys.  Hello, L-A.  I already know, because, uh, Lola showed up at Rascals last night for the Jay Moore, Jim Norton show.  How was it, sitting there all sticky?  I was really uncomfortable because my hair kept sticking under my arm.  Ah.  Now, I was sitting in the back, and I saw you show up halfway through Jay Moore's set.  So, you missed well over an hour and a half of the, of the night. 
[00:38:30]  And I thought to myself, that's weird.  Why is she showing up so late?  She really wanted to check out Jay Moore and Jim Norton last night.  I found out after the show.  Lola, would you like to share with everybody?  Yes, I've been disowned by my family for what I did yesterday.  Disowned?  My mother told me I can pretty much consider myself not having a family anymore.  Because she does not even listen to you guys' show, like, at all.  But I guess she heard that I was on and checked it out. 
[00:39:00]  And was just mortified with what I had done.  Ran right to the Internet and saw the pictures.  And she thinks I'm a porn star now.  A porn star?  Well, that's what she called me to do.  I just came out of a very bad influence with my sister.  That's horrible.  And I also got laid off from my job today.  So, can I do a wacky stunt to maybe get myself a new home and a new job?  Wait, wait, why'd you get laid off?  I missed work, and this one day that I guess was still in the probationary period of my job beginning.  Was that yesterday you missed work? 
[00:39:30]  Maybe.  So, you had nowhere to live and you lost your job?  Right.  Well, can I do a wacky stunt to maybe get a home and a job?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  So, where did you sleep last night?  Well, I just stayed out for, like, a really long time so that my parents wouldn't be around or awake when I got home.  Oh, but you slipped in.  You went home, though.  Yeah.  They're not really going to disown you.  Oh, no, no, no.  Well, they really are, though.  Like, they're not speaking to me, and they're, like, throwing, like, classified ads with apartment circles at me. 
[00:40:00]  Well, it'll blow over.  Give it a couple days.  I need to get out of their house.  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mime.  No.  Do you know if Norton needs a personal assistant?  Maybe I can do that for a living.  He's going to probably call in seconds and say, yes, yes.  Oh, man.  So, you went home after the show yesterday?  Well, I kind of drove around for a while before I went home.  Did you get a phone call or something that tipped you off that there was going to be trouble at home?  My 19-year-old sister was, like, waiting at the door, like, get out of the house. 
[00:40:30]  You're in so much trouble.  Does she want to come down and maybe do something?  I don't know.  She's a little shy.  Get your soul thrown out of the house.  Let me see.  Tommy might be able to help you.  Tommy, what's going on?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  You're on with Lola, the star of the show yesterday.  Hey, what's up, Lola?  Hello.  I got a spot for you to live.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I got some, you know, I got a garage.  But it's got, like, two levels, kind of.  And I got some old boxes and there's, like, an old mannequin there.  It might scare you a little bit.  But, I mean, you can live there if you want.  I feel kind of guilty.  I mean, if I had a daughter like that, I'd probably disown it, too. 
[00:41:00]  Oh.  A lot.  Jeez.  No, Oprah's right.  I mean, that's your little girl.  You're raised her.  You thought you did good.  Next thing you know, you got Opie and Anthony tarring and featherer and a guy like Jim Norton.  Things will get much worse than that, Lola.  I think you kind of hit the bottom.  I think you're really mean.  No, I just feel bad for your parents.  Boy, I didn't see this coming.  Jesus.  Make Lola cry.  Shut up.  Make Lola cry.  Boy, I didn't see this coming at all.  I usually can see exactly what the person wants to talk about when I plunk them down, Anthony. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, I just feel bad for her parents.  I mean, do you have your grandparents still alive, Lola?  Don't talk to me.  I don't like you.  I'm just coming to know.  Are your grandparents still alive?  Do they see this?  I mean, are they in Florida, or where are they?  Or did they die?  And if so, do you miss them?  Just then, I'm not talking to you.  Do you miss your dead grandparents?  All right.  Thank you, Tommy.  I'm not talking to you.  All right.  That's horrible.  Lola.  Damn people.  Lola.  Yes.  That's horrible.  Yes, that was not nice. 
[00:42:00]  So we've got to find a place for you to live and a job.  Yes.  What do you do?  Like, what kind of type of work do you do?  Well, I gave Rick my resume yesterday, actually, in case there was openings at 1027.  Oh, yeah?  That's what I like to do, pretty much, entertainment industry stuff.  And what I was doing for my work was nothing related to my career at all.  You went to Emerson College, huh?  Yes, I did.  I know of a couple other people that went to Emerson College around here.  Our own Ben and Psycho Mark.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Did you know any of them?  You seem to be about the same age as them.  No, I didn't know them.  You don't know Psycho Mark?  Well, on the radio.  That's all I know of them.  Did you do college radio up there?  Yes, I did.  Strange.  Wasn't Psycho Mark running the station back then?  Well, I went to Northeastern for my first couple of years of school.  Who was the PD at that station?  I don't remember his name.  Could it have been Mark Walsh?  I believe it was.  Yeah.  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.  Were you, um... 
[00:43:00]  You know if he got in trouble for mooning a camera or something?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They had the cameras set up so that the kids in the dorms could see what was going on in the station.  Right.  And they had to turn it off because he mooned somebody once.  Of course.  How does this story go, Ben?  Psycho Mark was the program director of the college radio station.  How disturbing is that?  Well, he's very unethical in his program director, but he was a PDF to me, but...  Why was he unethical?  Well, gee, why do you think?  I don't know.  He was banging every chick at the station. 
[00:43:30]  Was he?  But I mean...  Oh, no?  He had hooked up a TV camera to watch the DJs during the show, and so he just fully pulled  down his stance, and it was broadcast to all the dorms and the cafeteria.  Look at my yam bag.  And he got in trouble for that.  Dude, he got fired from the radio station at least six times.  I'm not even kidding.  He kept getting in trouble, and they keep letting him back.  That's too good.  All right, Lola.  We definitely feel bad. 
[00:44:00]  Well, I wasn't calling to make you guys feel bad.  You guys made my week.  With all the crap that's happened, you made my week.  And you broke the streak.  It's no longer pig week.  Exactly.  I'm so proud to have broken the streak.  Well, all the stuff that happened was because of what happened here.  See, I don't care.  That's the thing.  Yeah?  I did this.  It was my decision.  What was your mom actually saying?  Was she yelling at you?  Well, she got at me when I was sleeping, so my guard was down.  So you're sleeping.  All of a sudden, she comes in.  You wake up.  You're all groggy.  And what does she say to you?  What is this pornographic nonsense? 
[00:44:30]  Hey.  You want me to call your mom and smooth things over?  We can actually do that, Lola.  We've done this before, and we're really good at it.  And it kind of breaks the tension.  If you want to, we'll put you on hold, and you can give the number to Rick.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  We'll try to smooth things over.  Yeah, we're pretty good at this.  We're actually good.  I hope you don't ruin it.  We're really good at taking care of these things.  All right. 
[00:45:00]  Rick's got it picked up.  Holy smoke.  If we get through to her mom, it's make her mom cry.  Matt from Strong Island.  Now the Philly fans know how us Mets, Knicks, Islanders, and Jets fans feel about Opie's sports curse.  People of Philly, I've got to be honest with you.  You heard it yesterday.  Opie guaranteed a 76-er win last night.  He is sports gonorrhea.  You're horrible.  Your teams always lose. 
[00:45:30]  As soon as I guarantee to win, you can hear the moaning in New York.  Sealed the fate.  And this guy from Philly, Dave, he already gets it.  Please get off the air.  The 76-ers have not won a stinking game since you first came on the air.  You're a jinx.  Start your show after the playoffs are over.  Yep.  Yep.  All right.  Rick is calling Lola's mom.  Ziggy is getting restless.  All right.  We'll get to Ziggy in a minute.  Do we have some audio of Lola's mom from last night? 
[00:46:00]  She was a whore.  Let me put Lola back on here.  Like the Sopranos.  Lola.  Yes.  What are the odds that we get through to your mom when she talks to us on the radio?  I don't know.  Maybe it'll make her feel better to vent.  Maybe.  You know?  Maybe.  There's probably only about a million people that have seen your picture so far.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  Only a million.  Yeah.  Now that we're on in a few markets.  And only about, like, my entire town.  Huh?  Only my entire town also.  Well.  Because, like, all my guy friends were listening and checking it out. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, they were checking out the pics and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah, rock.  Uh-oh.  Rick just hung up on your mom.  What?  Rick?  Rick?  Rick?  What's the problem?  Oh, she doesn't want to talk.  What'd she say?  She was very firm with me.  Oh, no.  What'd she say?  She said, you know, I told her, do you guys want to try and help smooth things over?  She goes, I don't want to speak about this incident.  It has nothing.  I'm not going on the radio with them. 
[00:47:00]  It's a family matter.  And, Lola, you're screwed.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Dude, I tried.  We should have done it on the air.  Oh, we can't leave things like that to Rick.  We should have just called it, done the silent, you know, the one-sided conversation.  You want to do one-sided conversation?  I think I'd be able to do this.  All right.  No, if she already flipped out, you don't want to get her any more testing.  Give me the phone.  Hold on.  I'm trying one time.  What's her name?  I got it.  I got it.  All right, hold on.  Yeah, okay, go. 
[00:47:30]  Okay.  My name's Robin.  Hoo-hoo.  All right, we're dialing up the house, right?  Here we go.  We'll try one time here.  Is it ringing, Anthony?  Yes.  It's going to be a one-sided phone conversation until we get her permission to go on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  What if it was ringing, ringing, ringing?  She's probably listening to the show right now. 
[00:48:00]  Still ringing.  Still ringing.  She sounded like her voice was starting to quiver when I was talking to her about it.  Robin was quivering?  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  Very funny.  Oh, yeah, I've got the machine.  Oh, she ain't picking up.  I know.  She's not picking up.  See, you reamed it.  All right.  We got to, whenever we call somebody, we can't let, no offense, Rick.  It wasn't me.  We can't leave it to Rick.  We got to be, because we're, we're the diplomats. 
[00:48:30]  I am so goddamn diplomatic, you'll crap yourself.  What, Lola?  She has caller ID, so she knew you guys were calling back.  She probably didn't answer on purpose.  Ha.  Oh, ha.  All right, well.  All right.  Thanks for trying.  Well, call us back if you get through to her and tell us what's going on, okay?  All right.  There goes Lola from yesterday.  You can see her fine pictures up on WNEW.com.  Aw.  And that was your music.com.  She's homeless and jobless.  What's her expertise?  We never found out. 
[00:49:00]  No?  No.  All right, we got to get Ziggy in here, Anthony.  Yes, Ziggy.  Now, we haven't talked to Ziggy in a year and a half.  Keep him over there.  Hold on, hold on.  Don't get him in yet.  We got to explain who's Ziggy.  It really stinks.  Because there's a lot of people, even in New York, that have no clue who Ziggy is.  Anthony?  Yeah, it was a while ago.  Christmas, maybe two Christmases ago?  A year and a half ago.  A year and a half ago.  We did something called the Homeless Shopping Spree.  See?  O&A have a heart, you pricks.  We took a bunch of homeless people, gave them $107 or $102 each. 
[00:49:30]  I forgot where we were.  $102 each.  And sent them to one of the most exclusive, upper-crusty, snobberific malls in New Jersey.  Short Hills Mall.  Short Hills Mall.  To go on a little shopping spree.  The homeless shopping spree.  The people in the mall horrified.  We had thousands of people show up at the mall.  Yeah, the locals were just horrified, you're right.  Horrified.  I mean, they're going into... 
[00:50:00]  But what's one of the real exclusive suit stores they have there?  Well, you want to tell...  Where do we go?  Versace.  Neiman Marcus.  Neiman Marcus.  And here's these stinky homeless people.  Let me try on that suit.  A very nice watch place, I forget.  Cartier.  Cartier.  Right, the guy with a big security guard and a glass wall that they pulled down.  Yeah, they were...  You know the gates that they pull down when the mall closes?  As the group is working their way down the mall, the gates are just slamming shut.  Horrified people. 
[00:50:30]  And Ziggy, one of the stars.  Ziggy must have had ten coats on that day.  Yeah.  He doesn't bathe.  The smell was just incredible when he walked in the studio for the first time to talk to us  before they went off on the shopping spree.  He occasionally lives in a shelter here in New York City.  But you could usually find him on the streets.  Right.  Like Ben sees him all the time.  Stinky.  Just sees him on the streets babbling.  Right.  Wearing 20 coats and stinking.  And I guess he's off the sauce?  Supposed to be off the sauce. 
[00:51:00]  Now, remember a year and a half ago, he sang a song, a Christmas song, that was so touching, Opie.  If you remember, he sang Silent Night.  Right.  Do we have that?  Yeah, we have Silent Night.  Now, Ziggy.  Grab a Kleenex.  This rendition of Ziggy singing Silent Night.  Ziggy, do you know any Christmas songs?  Yeah, I know a Christmas song.  I like all of them.  You want to sing one real fast for us?  Let's see if I can sing it.  All right, then.  Let's go.  Silent Night. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  Holy Night.  All is calm.  All is bright.  I didn't have them pegged as an alto.  Round yon virgin, mother and child.  Oh, the infant so tender and mild.  Sleep in heavenly peace.  Sleep in heavenly peace. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  Let's hear it for Ziggy, huh?  And there he is.  He was the star of the homeless shopping spree.  We haven't talked to him since.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, it's bad.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Do you remember the day he came in and he's sitting in here?  And first of all, he was reading like the rock faxes and he was just dumping them all over the place.  And then he's saving something.  Like this whole studio is strewn with papers.  It was just faxes and news clippings and everything.  And he was picking some up, throwing some down, and taking other ones and folding them up and putting them in his pocket. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know what system he was using for the keepers and the ones that he threw away.  But he had something going there.  It was a system.  All right.  Well, let's get Ziggy in here.  You got the digital camera?  Bring in Ziggy.  Because he's got his summer look going on.  He's got the summer hat.  Is it summer, Ziggy?  He's got the summer hat.  A year and a half.  Oh, Ziggy.  Wow, Ziggy.  You look different.  Ziggy looks completely different than he looked...  Ziggy, you lost weight. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, I'm a little bit more scared than I was.  Why is that?  Don't be scared.  Take yourself down there, Ziggy.  But it's a very beautiful trip outside.  Yes.  And it's actually warm.  Isn't it nice?  Oh, that's why he lost weight.  He doesn't have to wear ten layers of clothes.  It's the clothing, maybe.  But you had a little cap on, I think, last time, too.  So I wasn't able to see your hair.  Which is getting a little long, Ziggy.  Yeah, I know.  You got the hippie look.  You're like a hippie.  You're looking good, Ziggy.  Take a seat.  You can relax.  Oh, I...  I mean, it's beautiful outside. 
[00:53:30]  Beautiful.  Yes, it is.  It's actually warm.  Last time it was Christmas, it was cold.  It was cold.  And I'm nice and clean and everything else.  You're clean now.  Yeah.  Yeah, you look all cleaned up.  You're not dirty.  Took a shower just before I got here.  Where did you shower?  With a whole bunch of...  A whole bunch of people?  Yeah, a whole bunch of people.  Not at the same time.  Called a fountain.  No, not at the same time.  The old zippies.  Really?  Yeah.  At the shelter?  How do they treat you over there?  Nice?  It's... 
[00:54:00]  Well, yeah, yeah.  Very nice.  Treat you good?  They feed you and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  No one's beating on you or anything?  No.  That's good.  You can't be getting beat on.  No.  I see you eyeing the beers over there.  Do you want one of those?  Are you off the sauce, Ziggy?  I don't think I'm allowed to drink any.  Oh, you're not allowed to drink?  No, I'm not allowed.  Who told you that?  Well, uh...  I was cured already from this  because I drank too much.  Oh, cured from the alcohol. 
[00:54:30]  I would never stop drinking.  I would drink every day  and I was intoxicated.  Yeah.  And once I got cured,  I felt like myself again.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  So this is yourself  and you feel like yourself.  Yeah, I feel like myself.  Now, what did you feel like  when you were drinking?  Oh, I felt terrible,  but it just...  It just kept me going.  Yeah?  And I...  It kills the pain,  doesn't it, Ziggy?  Yeah, that's what I... 
[00:55:00]  So if you're in a little bit of pain,  you're down some booze,  where'd you get your booze?  Like, if you didn't have any money,  how did you get alcohol?  No, I always managed to...  You always managed to get the alcohol.  Yeah.  Sometimes you'd put off  maybe buying some clothes  in order to get some booze.  Yeah, but I'm finished with that.  You're finished with the booze?  I know all about it.  I know all about it.  How long has it been  since you had a drink?  How long exactly?  Yeah.  Five months.  You go to AA or something? 
[00:55:30]  No, I just quit.  You just quit cold turkey?  No, I went to the hospital.  Oh, in Brooklyn.  In Brooklyn, you went to a rehab or something?  Yeah, that's the name of it.  And they made you stop drinking?  Yeah.  Wow.  He looks pretty good.  He's actually...  I'm able to carry on a conversation with Ziggy.  I never thought that would happen.  You know, when you were in here  a year and a half ago,  you were a little intoxicated.  Yeah, it was a wonderful thing to go through.  Ziggy, you know,  bowl and do other things with your time?  Yeah, they even make you go bowling at once. 
[00:56:00]  They make you go bowling?  Yeah, once I go bowling over there.  How'd you do?  I made one strike.  Oh, there you go.  Not bad.  Not bad.  You know what I like about bowling?  The beer.  Well, but, you know, Ziggy,  I'm not saying anything, but...  You can't drink your beer over there at all.  No?  Really?  At the hospital.  Oh, at the hospital, yeah.  So they're not going to let you drink.  Now, what else do you do  with your time there, Ziggy?  Well, you're doing...  You play golf or...  No.  What kind of activities?  It's mostly an educational program. 
[00:56:30]  So what are you learning?  How to control yourself,  not to have a habit,  make it a habit.  Right.  Any jobs in the future or anything?  You're training for any...  Possibly, yeah.  What are you interested in?  What would you like to do?  My own family passed away,  and I'm about to rest for the left,  and I have one brother.  I don't know why...  You plan on passing away? 
[00:57:00]  No.  What did you say?  Maybe so.  Maybe so.  No, no, no, no.  Jody!  Hey.  What's going on?  We're talking to Ziggy.  Oh, Ziggy's my buddy,  except we call him Wallace.  Wallace?  He's got plenty of names.  Do you go by the name of Wallace, too?  You remember we went and played chess?  Wallace, remember?  Our friend from California.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, how you doing?  We've been looking for you.  We haven't seen you in so long.  Yeah, not bad.  Yeah, you're not over by a walk and roll anymore?  I could, but I don't try. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  I'm not in practice.  Oh, we missed you.  We were looking for you.  We couldn't find you.  We were worried.  Maybe we should get Ziggy a girl or something.  Oh, slow down.  Ziggy, would you like a girl?  When was the last time you had the pleasures of a woman, Ziggy?  Pleasure of a woman when I was a kid.  When you were a kid?  Yeah.  So that many years, you think about it?  No, I don't have no trouble.  She's still around.  Yeah, oh, she's still around?  Yeah.  So you have like a girlfriend? 
[00:58:00]  I don't go out with her, but she's still around.  She's still around?  Yeah, she does her own business.  She does her own business, but you don't have a girlfriend or anything?  No, I don't need any other.  Well, Ziggy, we got a girl for you.  Look at this girl.  Isn't she cute?  Oh, hello.  You know who that is?  What do you want to act with?  She's been on TV.  Yeah.  What do you think, Ziggy?  Well, I don't know what you're saying.  I think you're mighty fine.  Wow.  She's a virgin, too. 
[00:58:30]  Britney's gone blonde.  Oh, not so long.  No, Ziggy.  Britney's gone blonde.  She'll treat you like a bottle of fudge hair dye.  You know what?  Britney's done with those.  Yeah, I'm actually gentle with those bottles of hair dye.  Ziggy, what do you think of Britney?  She was on TV.  Remember that show that no one watched, Big Brother?  Remember the one reality show that never, ever took off?  Big Brother, where they put all those people in the house and videotaped them.  Doing absolutely nothing for much too long? 
[00:59:00]  Let me take a wild chat.  While poor Ziggy's on the street.  Okay.  Drunk off his ass.  Does Ziggy not have a TV?  Maybe he does.  Ziggy, you watch any TV?  What are your favorite shows?  I don't know about any right now.  No?  You like...  I don't know how good you have the Patty Duke one.  The Patty Duke theme.  See, Brother Joe with that Patty Duke theme.  Here's Ziggy who lives in... 
[00:59:30]  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  The Patty Duke theme.  I've heard of it in my whole life.  When they have it, I'd repeat, you know?  Yeah.  To watch it repeat.  Ziggy, I've got to know when this all happened.  I'm fascinated by this.  When you were a young man, did you have a job and a home and a life that you led,  as most people do in the country?  Yeah.  When you were a young man?  I had a lot of things in my life.  Funny things.  So when you were a young man, though, you went to work every day and maybe you drove a car. 
[01:00:00]  What happened?  What happened?  What happened to get you to the point where you were homeless?  Well, sickness.  It was mostly sickness.  Sickness like a mental problem or the booze?  No, it was everybody I know was sick.  Everybody I ever know was sick.  I had some kind of sickness.  Was it back in the day where a lot of people were doing the acid and stuff and drugs?  Yeah, really.  Rock and roll?  Still going on at rock and roll. 
[01:00:30]  It's bigger than ever.  Right.  Brittany's going to cry.  Are you all right?  Brittany's very sensitive.  She's a sensitive girl.  She's a sensitive girl, Brittany.  So do you know where your parents are at all?  They passed away, my parents.  When you were young.  Gee, Brittany, thanks for bringing the show down.  I'm all fucked in.  I'm curious here.  You saw your nephew yesterday, didn't you?  Yeah.  And who else was with him, your nephew?  Oh, he's one of them.  Generations of people, right?  You were telling me before.  Yeah.  But most of his family is dead, Brittany. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  He told us that already.  Yeah.  But Ziggy, so you said everyone you knew had some kind of mental problem.  Where were you that this was going on?  Where was I?  I was all over the place.  Yeah, you were just sort of a traveler kind of guy.  Yeah.  So you never really had a stability in your life?  You never really had a place that you called your own or something?  Yeah, I had a lot of them.  But I just wound up with memories.  Memories.  Well, if you had a magic wand, would you want to make yourself one of those people that go to work? 
[01:01:30]  Or do you like living on the street?  I went to St. Joseph's school on Christmas Street.  St. Joseph's on Christmas Street.  Yeah.  And St. Joseph's on 6th Avenue.  And how long ago was that?  Many years ago, right?  Yeah, many years ago.  1949.  49?  How old a guy are you, Ziggy?  I'm not very old. 
[01:02:00]  I'll be 58 next month.  58.  That's not very old.  No, that's not old at all.  You look great.  Don't look a day over Sunday.  You sound like you look yourself.  I'm saying, sure, you know.  58.  Experience.  Yeah, see?  You got a lot of experience.  Who did that?  Tell them who we saw today when we were coming on the train.  Who I saw?  Yeah, a maggot.  He didn't see the maggot.  Even Ziggy can make fun of the midgets. 
[01:02:30]  Boy, midgets are pretty low on the rungs.  On the ladder.  Somebody would think I was fooling, but he was holding the car up.  And the midget could have ran right underneath the thing.  Really?  Like under the turnstile for the train?  Midget saw him and the midget was a girl midget and put the car up.  Because he saw the cop there and didn't decide to walk under and do a little limbo underneath the...  Well, it's a perk of, you know, if you're hurt of being a midget, you go right under those turnstiles.  Right. 
[01:03:00]  Of course.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Don't do this to him.  What?  Put the booze away.  You know what?  You can give him, Brittany.  Put the booze away, though.  There's four bottles of beer right in front of Ziggy.  Yeah, talk about an insult to injury.  Thank you.  Any of those buds over there?  I don't want any.  No, not you, Ziggy.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  See, Ziggy, I still have a problem.  Anthony, I have to apologize to our listeners.  This isn't really Ziggy.  It's Program Director Tim Sabian from WYSP. 
[01:03:30]  After almost a week of us on the air, he's in Philadelphia.  Really sounding a little different.  Right.  Well, this sounds like a happy argument to me.  Well, sure.  All right.  Okay.  Ziggy, you want to hang out?  We might have naked girls and stuff in the studio for you.  I'm not up there.  You don't like the naked girls, Ziggy?  You live down in the village a little too long, or what?  You're not a homo, are you?  Are you a homo, Ziggy?  No?  You ever have some of the gay sex, Ziggy? 
[01:04:00]  You want to?  I'm kidding, of course.  Do you have a girlfriend?  I don't have a girl that I take out or anything.  You don't have one you take out?  Do you have one that you make out with, though?  No, I don't have one.  Make out?  Yeah, Ziggy's in high school.  He's making out.  You're so young, Brittany.  Make out.  Timmy, what's up?  What's going on, Opie?  It's Timmy the Patriot.  I want to pay for your studios. 
[01:04:30]  You guys are horrible, man.  What?  Ziggy's having a great time in here today.  I know he's having a great time, but that's so tempting.  I could just do that to him.  What?  There are two ice-cold bottles of Bud in front of him, which I'm feeling bad about.  Take those away from in front of him.  Ziggy, you're not tempted to drink anymore, right?  You guys are horrible, man.  He's staring at him like a...  He is staring at him like a retard on a Ferris wheel.  Yeah, thank you.  He's staring at that like a retard looking at a cotton candy machine.  Yeah, get those away from him.  That's tempting.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, my goodness gracious.  All right, Ziggy, you can finally breathe.  We removed the beer.  That was John Wayne Gacy looking at man-ass.  Kid-ass.  Well, well, Ziggy, we took those away.  But that's great.  He's off the sauce, and you're starting to lead a more productive life.  Yeah.  That's good.  You're all cleaned up.  I forgot the word, but it's a...  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Like a new person.  You'll feel like a new person.  Alfred E. Newman and What Me Worry Kids. 
[01:05:30]  Alfred E. Newman from Mad Magazine.  Yeah.  What Me Worry.  You know any more songs, Ziggy?  Because you sang that Silent Night for Christmas.  I lost my voice a lot.  Yeah?  You know any NSYNC?  Yeah, we need another song from you.  We really like another Ziggy song.  Well, if I make a tape, I'll send it to you.  I can't sing right now.  You can't sing a little acapella right now?  Thank you.  Brittany, ask him nicely, because he has a really nice singing voice.  Do you know any songs at all? 
[01:06:00]  Is there, like, a sentence you could sing?  Sinatra?  Oh, Sinatra.  How about Happy Birthday?  New York, New York.  Happy Birthday.  How about New York, New York?  Yeah, sing New York, New York.  I can't sing anything, I'll tell you.  Really?  I really can't.  Can you hum?  You're saying Silent Night.  No, I really couldn't keep up with it.  You couldn't keep up with it?  Well, I'd say if I could get a wrong tape of a sentence or something.  That would be gold.  Especially when I...  It's better with harmony.  Oh, you've got to harmonize with somebody. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, it's better.  You've got the rest of the boys out there on the street harmonizing with you?  Yeah, that's...  Gray Wolf lays his flute.  I don't like to sing.  You see Gray Wolf anymore?  I don't...  I don't...  You don't remember, Gray Wolf?  You were drinking back then.  Gray Wolf.  Believe me, Gray Wolf was on the fire water, too.  Right.  All right, we'll take a break.  Ziggy, you're going to hang out?  Jay Moore's coming by to say hi to you.  Yeah, I'm just glad to come and say hello to you.  Well, you could sit around and hang around.  He had the memory.  Yeah.  It's amazing. 
[01:07:00]  You don't have to go anywhere.  Hang out.  Hang out.  You can sit down.  We're not going to bite.  No, but...  We'll show you the Jaeger machine.  Because I don't want to waste it.  I'm kidding, Brittany.  Brittany's looking at me like she's going to have to kill me.  We waste our time.  I don't know.  Finally, someone Brittany's taller then.  Well, you're always here.  Remember?  No, I just am visiting today.  Hey, Brittany, would you like to give Ziggy a hug?  What?  Ziggy loves...  He looks like your brother.  Huh?  He looks like his brother?  No. 
[01:07:30]  Rick?  Rick looks like Brittany's brother?  Hey, you look alike.  Oh, okay.  I'll go.  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  You don't have to leave, Ziggy.  Oh, you know what?  You can sit around.  It's nice.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I remember one thing from that fine Big Brother show.  What?  And that was that Brittany loves to hug people.  To hug people.  You're not letting this go, are you?  Brittany loves to hug people.  Ziggy, Ziggy, would you mind if Brittany gave you a hug?  She was hugging.  She likes hugging.  No, no, that's not the brother. 
[01:08:00]  That's not the brother.  No, I don't worry.  Brittany, why don't you give Ziggy a hug?  Ziggy, can I have a hug?  I can meet you again.  She wants a hug.  She wants a hug.  There we go.  Look at that.  Hey!  Oh!  How sweet.  Ziggy went for the butt.  I think he grabbed.  Did Ziggy get some stinky pinky?  He had it already before he started.  You guys are horrible.  Why?  It's Ziggy.  We love the Ziggy.  He's a little cute.  I wasn't expecting him to be coherent. 
[01:08:30]  I think that's pretty damn good.  He was a little coherent today.  I like that.  All right.  And you're Ziggy.  What?  What a mess.  Hey, there's a guy from Chicago on the line.  Chicago!  What is that about?  I have no idea.  We'll talk to him next.  What?  Oh, for Steve?  Oh, all right.  We're starting up in Chicago on Monday, Anthony.  Yes, we are.  The infection continues on CKG.  Chicago.  Oh, those poor people.  That's right, Brittany.  We're now on in Philadelphia, Brittany.  Oh, you are?  Congratulations. 
[01:09:00]  Thank you.  All right, listen.  We're going to take a break.  Brittany Spears.  Wow, a little Freudian slip there.  I'm drinking a Pepsi, so I like the same.  No, we all love Brittany Spears around here, and we love Brittany from Big Brother.  Yeah.  Jay Moore coming by as well, Anthony.  Cool.  Woo-hoo!  Oh, look at that.  Brittany likes the Jay Moore.  And as we go to break, it's Stephen Lynch's latest creation.  We've only played this, I think, once on the show so far.  It's called F Your Sister.  Great little ditty. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, I got a little tune, and then I'm going to sing with my buddy Mark here.  Okay.  I wrote this because Mark and I have been friends for a really, really long time,  and I think what makes us such good friends is that we're complete opposites.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's right.  We like different...  Well, that makes us good friends, too, Rick.  Thank you for the...  Yeah, why is everyone doing the universal sign for BJ?  So we wanted to celebrate the fact that we like different things with a little song.  It goes something like this.  All right.  I like my toast buttered, and I'll take mine dry. 
[01:10:00]  I dig the Beatles.  I'm a Stones kind of guy.  I have fine taste, and I like things cheap.  I want to stay up all night.  I just want to sleep with your sister.  What did you just say?  What? 
[01:10:30]  He just said something...  I want to sleep.  All right.  Here we go.  You ready?  No, I'm not ready.  I love the sunshine way.  And I want to nail your sister.  No, you said it again.  I like Julia Roberts movies.  I just want to F the S out of your sister.  Hey, Mark, you would rule.  Hey, if you'd say it's cool.  I'd go pick her up at a junior high school.  Yeah, your sister.  Yeah.  Are you talking about my old sister? 
[01:11:00]  I want to F your sister.  I want to F her in the A.  I don't know what you're saying.  And just C all over her chin.  Stop.  I stick my fist in her feet.  And I move it around.  Then I move it to her A.  It'd be so F and gray.  I'd nail her shit.  I want to F your sister.  Stop it.  What?  I want to make one thing clear.  I do not like Julia Roberts movies.  Very nice.  Look at that.

[01:13:00]  Yes, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Let me hear that again.  You want to hear that again?  Hi, this is Reverend Jesse Jackson.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening.  And you're listening to...  877-692-1027 is our toll-free number.  Strong supporters of the Rainbow Caller Show.  Brittany's in the studio, an old friend from the Big Brother Show,  the show no one watched. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, you know, everyone watches the reality shows.  Everyone.  I mean, you got that stupid fear factor thing that was on the other day.  That was kind of cool.  Oh, but...  I said kind of cool.  So far, not so bad.  Big Brother.  The one that everyone was like,  All right, end it already.  God, they're spending a week putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  Ooh.  Ooh, they're pedaling a bike this week.  Ooh.  And you lazy sons of bitches didn't even finish the jigsaw puzzle.  They gave them all these challenges, you know, 
[01:14:00]  that they had to do in order to win food or whatever the hell it was.  And one was to put together a jigsaw puzzle.  So for a week straight,  you look at this jigsaw puzzle on the kitchen table all in pieces.  And then occasionally you see one of them come by,  look at the pieces, slide one around, maybe put one in.  After a week, they had nothing else to do,  but they didn't even finish the puzzle.  Nobody cared.  Who wants to put a puzzle together?  Then who wants to watch it?  I know.  So we were just like, whatever.  We were watching from home.  We wanted to see the completed puzzle.  But she said something funny about who was working on the puzzle. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, there was one chunk of the puzzle that got done right away.  Jamie had worked on her face.  Jamie put her face, part of the puzzle that was Jamie's face,  and she put that together.  She was the one from Big Brother that was so full of herself.  The really conceited, stuffy aunt.  You know what's great?  I was just checking out nude pictures of Brittany on the Internet.  Oh, they're not me.  I know.  Did you see that?  They are so you.  Look at that.  Someone sent a link, and it says, 
[01:15:00]  here's Brittany naked at what, Burning Man?  Brittany, that is so you right there.  No way.  That's her right there.  I'm telling you.  That is a big girl.  You're not a big girl.  I was trying to put somebody really hot, and so that was me.  So there's somebody smiling.  So you're trying to say that?  There's one that has, that with the green dress is me, but the naked ones aren't me. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, I see you.  Green dress.  Do they put your head on this naked body?  Or it's just not you?  It's not even me at all.  It's not even my head.  Look at the girl.  Okay, hold on.  But anyway.  Let me get that on.  Let me get a look.  I'm trying to compare something on the knee area to you.  I see you mark here and here, and it seems to correspond with something there.  Are you absolutely sure this isn't you? 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  Because if it is, you've definitely lost a lot of weight.  Do you know your naked body?  I know my naked body.  But that one there, that girl doesn't even look like the girl above, does she?  Um, no.  It looks like two different girls.  Uh, Pat, what's going on?  Pat.  Are you talking to me?  Yeah, I'm talking to you.  Oh, my gosh.  Finally I got through.  I've been sitting here for like three hours.  All right.  All right, what do you got?  Okay, first I was going back to Lola.  Yeah?  You know, I thought you really dissed that girl. 
[01:16:30]  What do you mean dissed her?  We like her.  No, you don't like her.  Sure we do.  You ripped her, par.  You ripped her.  Pat, how deep are you into your third pack of camels today?  I don't smoke.  What's your excuse for that voice?  I'm old.  Oh, how old a gal are you?  48.  That's not old.  48, there you go.  Okay.  I'm not that old.  I'm not that old.  You're thinking old.  I have a feeling you have a problem with our radio show, huh?  I don't have a problem with your radio show.  I like it.  I listen to it and I laugh a whole lot. 
[01:17:00]  But today you did two things that I don't like.  Okay, go ahead.  Tell us.  One is diss a woman and make her be homeless.  Shut up, bitch.  That's funny.  Shut up yourself.  And then the other was Ziggy.  What's wrong with Ziggy?  I thought we had a great little interview with Ziggy today.  You made fun of his alcoholism.  How did we make fun of his alcoholism?  You made fun of him.  You suggested he get a relationship. 
[01:17:30]  He can't do that.  Come on.  He can't take care of himself.  We didn't suggest he get in a relationship.  You did.  I asked him if he was in a relationship.  Pardon me?  Pat, how deep are you into your third bottle of Jack Daniels today?  I don't drink.  You sound like you're slurring a little bit.  No, I don't drink.  How long have you stopped drinking?  How long have you been dry, Pat?  Three years.  Ever since the husband left, right?  No. 
[01:18:00]  Well, how long ago did your husband leave?  In 1994.  Yeah.  Go as you stop.  No, you're not going to trick me into this.  You're not going to trick me into this.  I just asked you a question.  I kind of could tell from your tone of voice that your husband left you.  No, that's okay.  That's not the point.  That's not the point.  Not so much that I want to kill her.  It's just I want her not to be alive anymore.  So, Pat, just because now you're on the wagon and stuff for many years that we can't even talk about it? 
[01:18:30]  No, no, no, no.  What's the problem, then?  No.  You messed up this old man.  He needs help.  Don't mess him up anymore.  He's getting help, and he's doing very well.  Pat, do you want a box of wine?  Get Ziggy back in.  You sound familiar, man.  You really sound familiar.  Get Ziggy back in here.  I want some drama, yay, and a box of wine.  You're funny.  You're funny.  You're funny.  No.  Okay.  You can talk to Ziggy yourself. 
[01:19:00]  Here, Ziggy is now back in the studio.  Ziggy, this is Pat.  Ziggy's not in the studio.  He's not in the studio.  Pat's on the phone, and she was upset that we were speaking to you about your alcohol problem.  Pat's on the phone right now.  Okay.  Say hi to Ziggy, Pat.  Hi, Ziggy.  Oh, what?  I can't even hear him.  Well, I don't have any problem.  I'm not an alcoholic.  It's not an alcoholic.  Ziggy, you are totally an alcoholic.  I was just a drunken bum. 
[01:19:30]  I was not an alcoholic.  Yes, you were.  He was a drunken bum, not an alcoholic.  That's true.  He just didn't go to all the meetings.  And you know what he did?  He decided that the booze was causing a problem with his life, and he just quit.  He didn't take any...  No, he didn't quit.  He quit.  He didn't quit.  Just because you couldn't quit and needed some help, which is fine, Pat.  It doesn't mean that someone like Ziggy couldn't quit on his own.  Ziggy quit drinking on his own.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  I love this. 
[01:20:00]  I love this.  It's so funny.  You guys are so funny.  Pat, you ever dream about a nice, cold rum and coke?  No.  No?  No, dude.  What were you like when you were drunk?  You must have been a bitch on wheels.  What was your...  Oh, yes.  I was totally belligerent.  Were you?  You were an angry drunk?  I was nasty, nasty, nasty.  What was your drink of choice?  Beer.  Beer?  And what was the thing that put it over the line for you that you said, holy crap, I got  to get dry?  When five state troopers were standing over me in an emergency ward and holding me down, 
[01:20:30]  they couldn't even hold me down.  What were you doing?  Okay.  You got that?  What were you doing?  What were you doing that they had to hold you down?  I was just mad.  And were you in a bar or something?  What's the lead-up story of you being held down?  We drank at home.  You were drinking at home.  Yep.  And did you call the cops?  Who called the cops on you?  No, I got in the car.  Oh, and then you decided to take a little cruise.  Yeah.  And did you hit something?  No, no, no. 
[01:21:00]  No.  But you got pulled over?  Yep.  That's it.  Because you're weaving and then you were belligerent with the cops and they pinned you down?  I was a belligerent drunk.  And that was the last time you drank?  Yes.  You had any slips over the years?  No.  No?  And that's why I'm trying to say, please do not suggest to Ziggy what he's going to do.  We're not suggesting anything.  Ziggy, you're fine with being here and everything, right?  Yeah, okay.  Ziggy, you are B's.  You are B's.  You know what that is?  What?  You know, you always spill things out yourself. 
[01:21:30]  What's an R-B?  Um, a real big something.  What?  No, R-A-B-A.  Real big a-hole?  Oh, come on.  Come on.  No.  What?  Pat.  Pat.  I'll say it.  I'll get bleeped.  All right, go ahead.  Say it.  A rat bastard.  You can say...  All right, all right.  I thought you could say bastard, your C-word, but obviously I can't use the C-word.  No, you can say bastard, Pat.  Okay.  But we're rat bastards.  That's how you are. 
[01:22:00]  Ziggy's enjoying himself, and he's getting his life back in order.  Yeah, but come on.  Come on, guys.  Ziggy, would you like...  Let's just ask him.  Ziggy, would you like a beer?  Don't say that.  What?  Say that to me.  Absolutely not, he said.  See?  Yeah, but that's...  Pat, would you like a beer?  No.  See?  Yeah, fine.  So what's the problem?  Somebody don't want any beer.  They don't have a beer around here?  All right, I'll have one.  Reach over.  Hold on.  You know what, guys? 
[01:22:30]  What, Pat?  Hold on, Pat.  Pat, check this out.  Watch it.  What?  Wow, that is an ice-cold beer.  It sounds like a Coke to me.  No, it's a beer.  No, that's a good beer.  We don't make anything on this show.  Oh, come on.  You can't even be on the radio with drinking.  Okay.  Whatever you say.  All right.  Whatever you say, Pat.  I just want to put that little girl...  Let me not have some more.  I want to put that little girl in the background there who was doing stuff this afternoon and 
[01:23:00]  doing stuff with Ziggy.  What, hugging him?  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, Brittany.  Okay, Brittany.  Hello.  Yeah.  Brittany from Big Brother.  You ever watched that?  Yeah.  In your drunken stupor?  Did you see Big Brother last season?  Pardon me?  Did you see the show Big Brother?  I'm not in a drunken stupor.  Oh, no.  I said, did you when you were in a drunken stupor?  I never watched that show.  It was stupid.  Wow.  It was a stupid show.  It was a stupid show.  Yeah, we could all agree with that. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Wait, wait, wait.  I wouldn't waste my time on it.  You have a problem with me hugging Ziggy?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Because you're encouraging him and you are placing him in a part of his life that you're  giving him some kind of encouragement other than getting better.  What do you mean?  You can't hug someone, Pat?  Pat, when was the last time you were hugged, Pat?  Last night.  By who?  At an AA meeting.  At an AA meeting?  Yeah.  When was the last time you had...  I'm thinking back to Fight Club where everyone hugged during those meetings. 
[01:24:00]  Pat, when was the last time did you hug and cry and slobber on each other?  Pardon me?  Did you hug and cry and slobber on each other?  No, I don't do that.  I don't do that.  When was the last time you were hugged by a man in a more romantic fashion?  Sunday.  Sunday?  Yeah.  You have a steady boyfriend?  Yes.  Oh, that's nice.  So you're getting some on a daily basis.  You're so funny.  You're so cool.  That's good.  That's good.  There you go.  There you go.  I'm happy for you. 
[01:24:30]  You getting some from this guy?  Pardon me?  You getting some?  Yes.  What kind?  Oh, good stuff.  You do everything, right?  Yeah.  See, at that age where it's like you just say, screw it.  I'm an alcoholic.  Alcoholics always do everything.  So you've got to be extreme somewhere else in your life since you gave up the alcohol,  so you're going to make that sex.  Not necessarily.  I was always that way.  Oh, really?  You wild girl.  I bet.  I bet.  When did you first start drinking?  13 years old.  I drank one time, and I blacked out, and I said, I'm never going to drink again. 
[01:25:00]  I didn't drink again until I was 20 years old.  So you're 20, and then you start drinking.  Did you have sex on that night when you were 20, and you started drinking?  No.  No?  I just picture her as being this wild frigging...  Oh, I'm wild.  I'm wild.  Did you have a lot of promiscuous, drunken sex?  No.  God, please say yes.  You want to have sex with Ziggy?  No.  Maybe you and Ziggy can hook up.  Ziggy needs help.  No, Ziggy's getting help, you tool.  I'm not a tool.  No, you're a tool.  Look at that. 
[01:25:30]  You're a tool.  He needs a tool.  He needs a tool.  He needs a program.  He doesn't need the program.  He's got a shelter to go to, and he's going to a program.  I live in a shelter.  And he gets to bowl every once in a while.  They take him bowling.  What's better than that, Pat?  Wait, wait, wait.  What'd you just say?  They take him bowling.  Bowling?  Bowling.  How cool is bowling?  That's for retarded people.  That's for retarded people.  Hey, Ziggy.  Don't goof on the retarded.  Ziggy, Pat's calling you retarded.  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that.  You said bowling for retarded people. 
[01:26:00]  Not to be called retarded from the likes of you.  Ziggy, you have something to say to Pat?  She's calling you retarded.  Obviously not retarded.  That's Pat that we just saw him.  Yeah, on the phone.  I don't even know who it was.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  I can't hear him.  I can't hear him.  That's right.  Can you put the microphone close in the half and he is, Jackie?  Oh, no.  It's Pat right over there.  Yeah, it is Pat.  No, Pat is on the phone.  That's Brittany.  That's Brittany.  Pat is on the phone, Ziggy.  What did you say?  I'm sorry. 
[01:26:30]  I don't know who I'm talking to.  Open your hand to me.  I can't hear him.  Everyone's talking.  At the same time.  I can't hear him.  You can't hear Ziggy because he's away from the mic talking very low.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, Pat, it looks like you're going to continue listening to us even though we're idiots.  So, yeah.  Right?  Even though I'm an idiot, too.  Oh, listen.  What's that little slip-up you had there?  It sounds like the tongue's been influenced by a little boost.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  Call us from time to time and let us know how we're doing, okay?  Don't you miss it, Pat?  Don't you miss the drinks and the fun? 
[01:27:00]  Is he thinking about the funnest thing ever?  Look, look, I drove my car and now the state troopers have pinned me down.  Is that the funniest thing I ever heard, Benjamin?  Pat's taking the knife out of the cheese.  You think Pat wants some cheese?  I can't help it.  Pat, I'm going to take a bath now.  My husband left me, Benjamin.  Is that the funniest thing you ever heard? 
[01:27:30]  No.  Do you hate Terry's wife?  Do you hate Terry's wife?  I thought I was doing very well with you.  Don't you hate Pat?  Don't you hate Terry's wife?  Don't you hate Pat?  Oh, you're a hedge.  I think now I should go to the hospital.  Oh, Pat, you're drunk.  It's drunk Pat, everyone.  Drunk Pat from Philly.  All right, Pat, check in from time to time, okay? 
[01:28:00]  Thank you very much, guys.  Have a good day.  All right.  There she goes.  There she goes.  God bless her.  Three years dry.  There you go.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie, Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Yes, Opie.  Sam Adams' passion and independence in brewing.

[01:28:30]  And it's won all kinds of medals in Belgium.  Two years in a row, won the Mond Selection.  In Belgium, Sam Adams Summer Ale tastes great.  It's crisp, refreshing.  This beer tastes like summer.  That's right.  We drink it all the time.  Opie, Opie, what am I drinking right now?  Sam Adams.  A Sam Adams.  An ice-cold Sam.  All right, look.  I'm not drinking a Sam right now.  Why?  We're out of Sam Adams. 
[01:29:00]  The whole fridge empty.  We need more Sam Adams.  I love it.  I can't even finish this, Will.  Sam Adams.  Pick some up.  Get some for us.  Please.  Restock the fridge.  I need my lager.  Sam Adams.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW. 
[01:29:30]  New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  877-692-1027 is the toll-free number to get a hold of us.  Brittany from Big Brother in the studio, Anthony.  Singers hate Chris Cornell.  Why?  Why?  How the hell do you do that?  This guy's just got the range.  That's amazing.  He's going to be singing with rage, so...  Yeah.  We'll have to wait and see.  What's up, Steve C.?  Cortisone injections right to the throat. 
[01:30:00]  Not Chris Cornell.  Just to everybody that has range, you say they inject themselves with cortisone to the throat.  No, no, no.  That doesn't give them their range, but that helps them keep their range, because your voice can get blown out.  Really?  Yeah.  Every single night.  Yeah.  Vince, Vince Neal, guys like Paul Stanley.  How we doing, everybody?  Exactly.  How we doing, Philadelphia?  Yeah.  You like my feather baller?  So you haven't had the injections. 
[01:30:30]  No, maybe I need some cortisone injections, Brittany.  How would you like some protein injections?  To your throat.  Come on, what?  I have my fudge bottle, so...  Yeah, fudge.  Someone wants to know if you're still a virgin, by the way.  Yes, I am.  You are.  What are you waiting for?  Isn't that a shocker?  Do you want us to bring in Stalker Patty to see what you will become?  You will see your future.  It'll be like a bizarre Twilight Zone episode.  Would you like to see your future?  I'm not Stalker Patty.  I am sure she is around this building right now.  You want to see your future, a 46-year-old virgin? 
[01:31:00]  And when she was your age, she probably thought, you know, I'm a virgin.  I'm just waiting.  I'm waiting.  And you might find yourself in that...  I actually had a really crazy fan letter.  This woman wrote me, and she went, all the reasons why she waited, and now she was like  40, and she still never had sex.  And it was really a sad letter.  She's like, don't let this happen to you.  You're working it up.  You're working it up like it's this big thing.  I'm just waiting to meet someone that I really like, you know?  What the hell?  Here's the guy that you want to hear.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore. 
[01:31:30]  He's a Hollywood star, this guy.  I see Radio Kryptonite is back.  Jay.  Jay, would you like to bang Brittany?  Oh, my God.  Absolutely.  Come on, Brittany.  Right?  We have a suite and everything waiting for you.  I'd have sex with you in front of my wife.  You need to just get it out of the way.  I don't think Jay Moore should be the first.  No, I'd be nice.  I'd be sure.  Oh, absolutely.  If it's the first time, no, she would not be ruining it.  Would you dig right in there like face-wise first? 
[01:32:00]  No way, man.  I would absolutely unequivocally make love to her.  Have you had that already?  You know, you're a virgin as far as the real thing goes.  But have you had a guy, you know, a guy with a little oral action?  Yes.  You've had that?  And you've had the guy do that to you?  One person.  One person has done that to you.  I'd let her do that to me, too.  No, I'm not talking that way.  Not only would I have sex with her, I'd let her have that also.  Have that also.  You're so kind.  I know.  So you've had a guy work that area down there and have fun and everything. 
[01:32:30]  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  And was he good?  Did you actually have a good time there?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I would...  If it didn't lead to intercourse, how good could he have been?  I know.  How loud...  You should be nowhere or something.  I'll make you shake like a car on bad gas.  Your head will cave in.  And you'll be like, please have sex with me just so I stop shaking this way.  I'm agitated in an odd, sexy, hot way.  That guy should have completed the job.  He should have finished the...  He couldn't close the deal.  You get that close to the closer.  Anthony, I got...  Was it Santana Moss? 
[01:33:00]  I heard about you.  Yeah.  He knew I didn't want to and he wouldn't...  I think some of that pepper spray might have helped.  You're down.  You're concentrating on the pain in your face.  And you'd never realize what was going on now.  Anthony, I got audio.  I got audio from the guy.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Pretty good.  How did you get that?  Oh, they are the eyes and the ears of the operation, honey.  Maybe she couldn't have sex for a certain reason.  I have audio from the guy.  Oh, yeah?  Hold the string!  Hold the string! 
[01:33:30]  Was it that time?  No?  No?  What?  You guys!  Eddie!  Yo!  Hey!  We have Eddie from Big Brother.  Of course, the winner.  The winner!  This guy won the money.  Eddie, what's up, bro?  How you guys doing, all right?  Yeah, we're doing okay.  Where have you been?  I just got to...  I've been around, man.  I'm running around.  I'm in and out of Toronto a lot.  I'm going up Monday, as a matter of fact.  Well, if you've been around, why haven't you returned my phone call?  Listen, baby.  Don't even stop.  Brittany, I got to say, you got some pair of balls coming into my town and then hanging  out with my friends. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, my God!  She just called up.  She was in town, and we said, come get your...  It's next time you can call me to hang out.  I'm at the Plaza.  It's only a couple blocks away.  Oh, thank you, guys.  What room are you in?  Yeah.  There you go.  I hope you're not under your real name.  Midnight rain, blue.  Are you under your real name?  You know, it's funny.  I get home last night, and there's a message on my meeting.  I'm like, who called me?  And it's this lady.  She's like, hi, this is Jenny Gar's mom.  I don't know where to send the camera crew.  So I just send them up to your room. 
[01:34:30]  And then she sends the room number.  And she's like, okay.  Name dropper.  Jenny Gar's mom's calling me.  You know you're big time.  I was on the snake, obviously.  Brittany, I've got to say, I'm giving you a hard time, but you look absolutely beautiful  and fantastic.  You look beautiful.  I'm waiting for the joke.  No, there's no joke.  You look really beautiful.  You're a cutie.  Like, last time I thought you were cute, and now I'm sitting here, and maybe it's because  your hair's pulled back and I can see more of your face.  You're very pretty.  There's no joke.  There is no joke. 
[01:35:00]  Thank you.  Eddie just goes, what a crock of ass.  Eddie, we had a dump out.  No, man.  She looks fantastic.  Jay, we all know, is just lining up another one of the girls to put in the case of emergency  break glass compartment.  He's always setting up these girls so that if something happens, God forbid, with his  marriage, he can just walk up to any one of these numerous girls and just close the  deal.  There's a lot of plane rides in this marriage.  You know what I'm saying?  You never know.  A lot of coast-to-coast stuff.  You never know. 
[01:35:30]  In case of emergency, break glass.  Get ass.  Right.  We've got to get past this virginity thing, Brittany.  Yeah, you're putting too much pressure on yourself.  Yeah, because now you're...  I don't feel pressure.  Once you take one, well, you'll feel a little pressure.  But once you get one, that's it.  Like anything else.  You know, I don't have it.  Like Pat's first beer, you know?  When Pat, who called before, had that first beer, I'm sure everything was fine.  Before you know it, there's more beer in her mouth than anything else. 
[01:36:00]  Well, she said she blacked out the first time.  Yes, and you would, too.  Yeah, you would.  There's nothing stranger than, like, a hot girl talking about her virginity over and over.  Because after a while, you're like, well, let's just have sex right now.  Get it over with.  I don't think it's that big of a deal.  I don't need to have sex.  Well, then, let's just go do it.  Just do it.  If you don't think it's a big deal, let's just get it over with, then.  Let's do it.  Radio Hyman.  Are you waiting for marriage?  No.  You're just waiting for the right guy?  Jay Moore.  You've been around.  I'm Mr. Right Now. 
[01:36:30]  You've been around, though.  Let's put it this way.  The guys ain't going to get much better.  You've already been around.  You're talking to guys.  You're meeting guys.  There's not going to be the guy riding up on the horse with the...  You had some suit of armor on.  She had some fame, so the quality of guys had gone up.  You don't want to meet a guy in your 17th minute.  You know what I mean?  I just think...  Well, okay, I have commitment problems.  Commitment problems.  What do you mean commitment problems?  I just...  I can't date anybody for a long period of time.  Did you get along with your father?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, you have a problem staying with one guy for any length of time, so you don't want 
[01:37:00]  to just have sex with this guy, because then you'll be on to the next guy.  Yeah.  And you'll turn into what's called a slut.  And that'd be a little whore.  Nice.  Nice.  You know what we have to do?  Stalker Patty, I know you're listening.  You listen every damn day.  Get your ass to the studio.  We are going to show Brittany her future.  T.S.  Your future.  Dwell on it.  That's horrible.  Stalker Patty.  Eddie, help me out here.  You want those puny?  Eddie, come on.  Forget about it.  Eddie has no problem with it. 
[01:37:30]  Eddie's like on minute four, and he's taking his time.  He knows how to work it.  Eddie's out in the...  He's out greeting the people.  Where are you right now, Eddie?  I'm on Long Island.  Right.  You're out with the people, greeting folks, and taking care of them seven and a half inches  at a time, if need be.  I understand that.  You've got to spread the love of the Lord, even if it's seven and a half inches at a time.  You know what you're doing.  She's going to waste away to nothing.  Yeah.  Tell me the clock's ticking pretty soon, unless you, you know, get on Animal Planet or something,  honey, you know. 
[01:38:00]  Years will take time.  Post the wacky home video thing here or there.  Come on.  You've got to jump on these things, and if one of those things is a penis, you're in for  the ride, baby.  Ride the snake.  Don't let the snake ride you.  So be it.  Jay, she's a real horny girl, though.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Yo, Brittany.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the Opie.  Oh, we did a whole...  Oh, yeah.  Last time she was in New York, we really got into it.  Oh, yeah, buddy.  You don't even know.  It doesn't mean I don't get horny.  Yeah, but now, you know what?  You need a big freaking tool to just take care of that. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  A white one.  Dude.  What do you use again?  I forgot.  It's like a fudge what?  They have a problem with that word.  Hold on, hold on.  Quickly, because they have a problem with the M word as far as taking care of yourself.  Oh, again, we'll dump out of that.  Pleasure yourself?  Yes.  That's what you've got to say, because they have a problem with the M word on this show.  Why? 
[01:39:00]  Wait a minute.  No, no, we dumped out of the C word earlier.  No, we can't say the C word.  We dumped out of it.  Brittany.  What is going on over here?  For the next, like, 20 seconds, don't say a word, okay?  Hold on.  Let's start over here.  The delay must fill.  Well, it's a policy that's been put in place that the M word for self-pleasuring cannot really be used here.  So, let's not use it.  Okay.  Just say taking care of yourself or something like that.  And last time you were in, you talked about the last time you did it, and it was with a bottle of fudge hair dye. 
[01:39:30]  And we went to the website and looked at the bottle, and it looks pretty ample.  You did it?  Yeah.  What, did you sell it on eBay?  No, no, we went to the website that, uh...  She was supposed to pledge hair dye.  Oh, for the product.  Yeah, for the product, to just see the bottle.  You guys were so crazy.  It was so hot to just look at the bottle.  I completely understand.  Come on, Dave.  We had a look at the bottle. 
[01:40:00]  Absolutely.  I get it on every level.  Look at a bottle, Norton.  Gary, you never saw that bottle, Norton.  Mrs. Manicotti don't use fudge bottles.  Carlos has a fudge bottle.  Carlos has a fudge bottle.  Now, get out!  So, she used a fudge bottle.  And, uh, what was that?  Now, that's been a while.  Yeah, that's been a while.  So, what was the last thing you used, Brittany?  Believe me, for all the guys out there, this is hot. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, God.  I used a watermelon.  What was the last thing you used?  You were in your hotel.  You were at the plaza.  Last night, right?  I think she did it this morning.  Get some spancher vision on, right?  Brittany from Big Brother, everybody.  She did it this morning.  Which hand did you use?  Righty or lefty?  Right.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  Do you do it on your back or on your belly?  Both.  Oh, that's hot.  A little button here.  Look at that, right?  Right?  Nice.  You're doing it. 
[01:41:00]  Isn't that great?  Oh, God.  I'm getting a flow.  Sometimes it's not working, so you've got to flip over, you know?  Oh, I'll make it work, Brittany.  I swear to God, I'll make it work for you.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  And then the big moment comes.  Now we're looking at hands.  I'll keep it.  Now we're looking at hands on eBay.  We're just staring at her right hand.  I know.  Look at that hand.  That hand has seen the promised land.  Like, wow, look at that hand.  Get your...  Watch your hand.  Brian from Jersey writes, 
[01:41:30]  Someone should tell this retarded twat,  excuse me, Brittany, sorry for that,  that she's not a virgin.  She had oral sex.  Sex is in the goddamn name of the act.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Just like those stupid twats that have A to stay a virgin.  Cheat, man, cheat.  Come on.  Come on.  No, that, of course.  If you've had no man...  Well, I think it's...  I think that people that go in order to stay a virgin,  I think that's stupid.  I mean...  So are you that stupid?  No, no.  Like I said, it was only with one person.  It was somebody that I was really...  You know, I dated a long time, 
[01:42:00]  and we were...  Yeah.  You know, I just wasn't...  Do you like to be spanked?  I mean, the right way.  You like to spanked the right way.  Right, the right way.  The way I would do it.  You got a little dirty girl streak in you, right?  A little sometimes.  The way I would do it.  The way you'd do it.  You like it, right?  You like it?  Could you demonstrate, maybe?  No, you...  Don't...  Yeah.  Don't even say that.  Oh, hell, yeah.  You want him to be...  He'll pick over his knee  and give you a little spanking on the butt?  No, no, no.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'll do it so well.  I'm kidding.  You like being spanked?  You like being spanked? 
[01:42:30]  Like my head?  Like a spank being spanked?  Can we change the topic, maybe?  All right.  You like to be...  You haven't answered it.  You like to be spanked.  I know you do, but people in...  You know, I know what your face is saying,  but on radio, people in their cars,  they don't know what you look like.  I actually haven't ever been spanked.  Oh, honey.  No.  Let me pinking up your cheeks.  You want Jay to just do it through the pants?  No.  He can do it through the pants.  No.  Just through the pants.  No.  He can do a lot of stuff through the pants.  She said, just for the story, we should do it.  Right.  Anthony, she's saying no.  Get the pepper spray. 
[01:43:00]  It'll be...  It'll be a reality show.  People really go down with the pepper spray.  I love it.  Brittany, it'll be in the Post tomorrow.  More publicity for you.  Free pub.  Yeah.  Jay Moore and Brittany spanking each other on a local talk show.  Oh, no.  I'm going on.  They're national.  No, but they'd mess it up, and they'd say that.  Yeah.  Local talk show hosts spanking session.  Come on.  No.  Leave me alone.  Oh, she's getting a laugh.  You know what?  We've got... 
[01:43:30]  Even though you're...  Before you know it, she's up on the pinball machine.  Oh, God.  No, it's not going to turn into a scene from a cue.  I know.  If you don't want to be spanked, we'll do it anyway.  No.  Of course we wouldn't do it.  Even though you're sitting on it, I can tell that's...  Yeah.  You ever had the salad tossed?  Oh, yeah.  Did that boyfriend do that for you?  The only thing in the world.  Jay talks about that in his act, and it's priceless.  I love doing it.  He has no problem with just getting the face by the back door and just working it. 
[01:44:00]  Absolutely.  But the salad tossed is the same thing as the rim job?  Yes.  Yes.  Something like that.  I thought about that in the house.  Actually, Eddie told me what rim job was.  Eddie, nice.  Eddie.  Yo, kid.  Eddie, how did that come up?  You know, I don't even know.  Yeah, I know.  You asked me if I'd like to teabag.  Oh, yeah.  Teabag in this way.  Yeah, we were supposed to put those teabag in.  Oh, man, Eddie.  102.7.  If they would have shown this on Big Brother, the conversation about teabagging and rimming. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, I'm like, what's teabagging?  So, you know, he goes, oh, see.  Let me show you.  Let me demonstrate.  Right.  Yeah, so.  Let's go out to the pool, the Big Brother pool.  It's real easy.  That's right.  You just got to lay back.  Okay, can you say the P-U-S?  No.  No, no, no.  Not in that context.  Okay, well, all right.  We could call it the peach.  Yeah, the peach.  Well, it sounds better when you say it, because the man, he, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because we were sharing different terms, and I didn't know what teabagging was or what rim  jobbing was, and Eddie didn't know what it was.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  I know.  What a man.  Oh, my God.  Can you read that?  Just use the first letter of anything you're talking about.  Just use the first letter.  My father was a cryptographer in Vietnam.  Yeah.  Maybe we should call Big John.  It's like going through Newsday.  You ever see the crypto quotes where every letter replaces another one?  Well, okay, I'll just explain it.  My doorman, Tony Lopez from the Bronx right now, is going, I got it. 
[01:45:30]  Keep going.  Tony Lopez from the Bronx, baby.  What is it?  Just use the first letter.  P.  Okay, just the man.  Say the whole thing.  The man's P.  No.  No.  I know.  It's my hole.  You know what I'm saying?  Yes.  The man said A.  A-hole.  Okay.  The whole, it's lost.  What did you get on your SATs?  Did you sign your name? 
[01:46:00]  Did you take it with a crayon?  Yes.  Jim Norton.  Melissa, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Brittany.  Mr. Wright's never going to come.  Just go out one night, get all dressed nice and sexy, be nice and drunk, and you'll find him.  And you'll have lots of sex with him.  Every guy's the right guy when you're saying.  Who's that guy in the car next to you?  Who's the mafioso to your right?  All right, Melissa, thank you.  Did you hear that guy in the background of that car? 
[01:46:30]  It's Eddie.  Eddie on the other line.  Oh, it sounded like you were sitting next to her, and she was about to get whacked.  That was a weird mixture.  So, Melissa, the right man will never come, and she should just go out and bang.  There is no Mr. Wright, honey.  You're just going to have to go out one night, find a nice, big guy, and you will have lots  and lots of fun.  Are you going to let us know when you finally lose your virginity?  Hell no.  You have to.  Are you kidding?  Why?  You guys are going to make fun of me?  No, we're going to make fun of you right now. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, gonna?  Right.  Smutten up.  You're just waiting.  You're waiting for something that I don't think will ever really meet those standards.  I'll just, when I know, I'll know, and I'll just, you know, I'm not worried about it.  It'll just happen.  Can you call us when it's happening so we can broadcast it?  Yeah.  Let us know.  Jason, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Well, I like Brittany from the show.  I thought she was totally hot.  You may remember me last year.  I was in on Halloween, the Slipknot guy.  Oh, yeah, Slipknot guy.  What's up? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Well, I just watched that show for her, basically.  Slipknot guy.  Oh, thank you.  All right, Jason.  Slipknot guy.  He's working at Hong Kong.  Slipknot guy.  I got a tip, a guy named Slipknot guy.  Not a Joe or an Eric.  Maybe a Sal.  Here you go, Slipknot guy.  Isn't that the best Seinfeld you've ever heard, Brittany?  Brittany's staring at me just desperately trying to figure it out so she doesn't... 
[01:48:00]  See, last time she was here, she had no idea who you were.  That was fine.  I didn't know who she was either.  Have you watched any Jay Moore productions since you've been in here and saw them last?  No.  No?  I'm the perfect guy to lose your virginity to.  Sorry.  Haven't?  Jerry Maguire.  He was in Jerry Maguire.  Hold on.  Anthony.  I know who he is now.  Oh, I know.  Drunk Pat.  We're kind of going back.  Anthony, drunk Pat from Philly's calling back. 
[01:48:30]  Pat.  Oh, my God.  Drunk Pat, how are you doing?  I'm doing very well because I'm not drunk.  I want a box of wine and some Grammar Yay and then I want to go home.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  All right.  What's your problem now?  No.  What are you doing to this young girl?  What are you trying to do to her?  She hasn't lost her virginity yet.  We're just saying if you get a few more years tacked on you, you're going to regret that you never did it.  Oh, come on now.  What?  How old is she?  How old are you?  Twenty-six.  She's twenty-six now. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Spread them.  See, now it's good because you look like you're 18, 19 years old.  Yeah, yeah.  But the thing is, you're a grandma.  She's twenty-six.  An old maid.  No, she's not a maid by today's standards.  Oh, yes, she is.  No, no, no, no, no.  Well, okay, when you guys want to look at the bodies of everybody and then you think that they're going to be old by the time that they're twenty.  Pat, when was the first time you had the pleasure of man-meat? 
[01:49:30]  Twenty-one.  No.  How old were you when you lost it?  Sixteen.  Sixteen.  Yep.  You drunk little slut.  Oh.  I love it.  It was nasty.  I love it, Gelman.  She didn't drink from thirteen to twenty.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, but I had nasty man-meat.  Yeah?  How was it?  Was it against your will?  I bet it was.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  I bet it was.  No, it was within my will.  A little puppy love that turned into sex. 
[01:50:00]  So is that good-looking uncle?  What?  Pardon me?  Did you regret having it?  No.  No.  See, it was good at sixteen.  He was Italian.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  He was Italian.  He was rocking.  Hey, Pat, get over here.  Let me punch you in the ribs.  We're going to do it in the backseat of my high rock, you weapon who.  On your stomach or on your side.  Those are your options.  You know that.  There you go.  Now, Luke, now you receive.  But what are you trying to do with this young girl?  That's what I'm trying to say.  Trying to get her laid is answering your question. 
[01:50:30]  Nothing wrong with getting laid.  So you're in the backseat with double J.  No, no, no, no.  Now you receive.  That was that.  No.  Nice.  It wasn't that.  That was fun.  That would have been fun, I suppose, but it wasn't that.  All right, Pat, we'll leave Brittany alone.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, right.  That's for Pat.  Yeah, you're going to leave her alone.  Yeah, because Pat's that's all.  You guys are ogling her, like, with big spectacles.  Is that why Pat didn't drink from 13 to 21?  You were too busy effing?  I couldn't get the bottle in my mouth. 
[01:51:00]  That's a big piece.  I love you guys.  I love you.  That was so fun.  All right, Pat.  Bye.  Okay.  Bye, Pat.  Is that Molly Shannon?  Our new friend.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  Okay.  Yeah, you got me.  You got me.  I love it.  Paul, what's going on?  Brittany has no idea who I'm doing.  Paul, I even said the name of the person.  I can't believe you're up, Brittany.  What?  I'm totally infatuated with Brittany.  You love her, huh?  Tell Bob Sugar to shut up. 
[01:51:30]  The boxing historian?  He's not here.  Bob Sugar to shut up?  Where did that come from?  Oh, Bert Sugar.  No, Bob Sugar.  Sugar.  Yeah, Jerry Maguire.  Hey, I used to spank it to Brittany every night.  Oh.  You wanted me to be quiet so you could gross her out?  See, guys have had sex to you.  I got a picture of her off the Internet.  I swear, it looks like a piece of crust from a D-O pizza. 
[01:52:00]  It's all crusty, he says, because, you know, he's been...  Hey, can Jay do a line for Jerry Maguire?  You just told me to shut up.  What a jackass.  You just told me to shut up?  I was just kidding, man.  Oh, what's up, buddy?  I'm a big fan.  Body, what's up?  I saw you a rascal.  Show friends.  Show...  Which one do you want me to do?  It's not show friends, it's show business.  I love that one.  Yeah, do another one.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  All right, guys. 
[01:52:30]  All right, let's go to Kelly.  Nice dismount.  Thank you.  That's a little creepy.  What?  That guy's who's spanking it to you?  How naive are you?  Please.  I just...  Swimming pools probably filled with the amounts that people...  Drink the baby batter.  Doing it to you.  I hung up on Eddie by accident, Eddie.  Sorry about that.  I'm sure it looked like an explosion at the Elmer's Glue Factory.  Why do you look surprised?  I mean, I guess you...  There's probably a guy right now doing it to your voice.  No, God, no.  I swear to God.  No, no.  And that guy, Jay Moore, right there. 
[01:53:00]  I'm doing it.  My hands are on the table, but my hands aren't on the table.  Look at that.  Dickie, outside.  Spanking it away for the first time in years.  I used to call him Larry Zonka, because he always walked by the comedy club, cradling  at 40, like he was third and long.  Larry Zonka!  He always had a big 40 in his arm, but he always covered it up with both arms, like  he was going through the line.  You know the Zig?  Yeah, I know Zig.  He was always outside Boston Comedy Club.  Hey, bring Ziggy back in here.  Clutching at 40.  Bring him back.  And he told me...  Yeah, like going through the line, and that surprise run plan, like third and 11, it's 
[01:53:30]  like, uh-oh, Zonka, get out of the way.  Yeah, Ziggy's picture's up on WNEW.com.  Ziggy covered up the rock, man.  Is it the one of him hugging Brittany?  Oh, yeah.  Kelly, what's up?  I gotta punch that up.  Let me see that, man.  I was there last night.  You were at Jay Moore's show last night?  Oh, my God.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  It was a good show.  Oh, thank you.  I saw Opie there.  Yeah.  But where was Anthony?  I couldn't make it last night.  Oh, my God.  I know what Brittany needs.  Huh?  Right.  Just like Opie said, have Patty come down, see what it'll be like. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  And bring Horton in the studio.  You need a little look to the picture.  Look at this picture of him hugging Brittany.  Oh, my God.  I'm glad you like the show.  And, you know, I want my money.  Goomba Johnny wants his money back for the eight ball that melted in his pocket on stage.  It was so hot in that room.  It was.  I was sweating like Moses Malone at the free throw line in simple overtime.  That game.  It was.  In particular.  Billy, what's up?  It was so effing hot in that club. 
[01:54:30]  Back to Billy and the hizzy.  I liked the Adam Sandler last night, Jack.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Josh, Josh, let me know.  Pat, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Pat.  Hey, I just wanted to tell Brittany, you know, when I first got laid, you know, I was  waiting, you know, and I was glad I waited for about five seconds after I got laid.  And then I just wanted to, like, screw everything.  Let me tell you.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  So don't wait.  Like uncorking the bottle, you know.  You got to uncork the genie bottle.  That's right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, nice, tight genie bottle.  Ziggy, these guys are surprised that you and I knew each other before.  Ziggy, you know Jay Moore?  Yeah.  If you live in a cloud, you recognize.  Yeah.  So you recognize Jay Moore?  I recognize because we look alike in a way.  You look alike.  Right.  You look alike. 
[01:55:30]  Look at our hairlines.  Yeah.  The same look, guys.  The same hairlines.  Wait a minute.  There is something to that.  You guys look alike.  Pop.  Yeah.  Pop.  Dad.  Should we get a picture of both of them together?  Oh, yeah.  Just separate your births.  Having sex with Brittany.  Hey, Ziggy.  Brittany's a virgin.  It's a wonderful thing.  It's a virgin.  It is a wonderful thing.  She says it's a wonderful thing.  But she's 26 years old.  Don't you think it's time to sell her oats? 
[01:56:00]  I met that hip today.  What?  I don't really understand a lot of those things.  No?  Why did you say it?  You don't understand nothing about those things.  No clue.  What?  Like the whole sex thing, Zig?  Yeah.  You know, she's got to get out and maybe start.  They put saltpeter in your water at the home?  Saltpeter.  Saltpeter in the gruel.  I mean, I almost thought.  Richard Johnson's right about Howard Johnson.  That's some of the best gibberish.  Christine, what's going on? 
[01:56:30]  Hi.  Hi.  I wanted to call Brittany and tell her that she should really go out and experiment a little bit.  I was a virgin until I was about 24, almost 25.  I'm 32 now.  And I just realized over time that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be,  that I really should have gone out and fooled around a little bit.  Well, it's not like this huge thing I'm dying to do and I'm holding back.  Well, no, I was the same way, too.  Well, actually, it was a little worse.  I was convinced that if I had had sex, I was going to go to hell. 
[01:57:00]  Well, you will, you slut.  Catholic, huh?  Catholic, huh?  Catholic, yeah?  No, since then I decided that that's certainly not the case.  No, I mean, I don't think that.  I just, I don't know.  It just hasn't happened.  What?  Jay Moore, man.  You a Catholic girl?  Catholic girl?  No, well, evangelical upbringing.  Evangelical.  Yes.  Bible comfort.  Let's break it down.  Keep your legs crossed.  I've long since left that. 
[01:57:30]  You must stay away from the pain of...  I spoke to the law.  I know a schedule.  Yeah, no, but since then I've kind of discovered that, you know, it was really awful.  What, you didn't like it?  Well, what, being a virgin?  Oh, I thought you meant the sex.  No, I love it.  All right.  Good.  I've discovered that I'm bisexual.  Oh, look at that.  See?  Now she's just a complete sex maniac.  Guys, girls, animals.  I'm glad you brought that up. 
[01:58:00]  Brittany, my wife's plane lands at 9.30 this evening.  And I figured, what better way to open the floodgates for you than with a great hot threesome.  Some hot three-way Brittany action.  Nice.  I'll give her a hand.  This girl turns into a hoo-ah.  This girl's farm animals.  I got mine.  Get yours.  Get out.  You don't want to sleep in the wet spot.  Get on the floor.  Lie.  Oh, you're harsh. 
[01:58:30]  Thank you.  All right.  So, good night, all.  Let's go on.  That's your advice to Brittany?  Get it over with, huh?  Yeah, just play around a little bit.  When you get older, you'll realize that it was probably better to play around, experiment  and stuff.  It's like, I'm in a very stable relationship.  I'm married.  We're very happy.  But now we're thinking, well, you know, it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be before.  So, let's put a little thing into it, and we'll swing, and we'll do something.  We'll do some other stuff.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea. 
[01:59:00]  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  All right, let's take a break.  Now she's swinging.  Did you hear that?  She goes, ah, I'm swinging.  Yeah.  Now she's swinging.  That always sounds great on the outside, but then when you watch the HBO show's on it,  you realize who's swinging.  Oh, God damn.  The guy that squeezes the shaman.  The big, fat, old guys.  Mr. Whipple.  Disgusting.  Yeah, Mr. Whipple is the slinger. 
[01:59:30]  He's going, hey, your wife, Nicole, huh?  You know what, Mr. Whipple?  They're just waiting.  Waiting for something hot to lock in the door to ravage.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, bro.  I'm pushing myself to her right now.  Oh, God.  You're a disgusting mess.  Hey, Marco's a priest brother.  We should take a break.  All right.  Something from the ONA Archive.  We'll be back. 
[02:00:00]  All-time association, may I help you?  Hello.  I have this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know where you are?  I have this number in my wallet.  You're lost?  I don't know.  I'm at a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here.  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone.  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number?  I believe it's the A's.  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on? 
[02:00:30]  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes, can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up.  Hang up?  No, do not hang up.  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what?  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  Cold like Brazil.  I believe I need a change.  Stay on the phone.  I'm wet.  You're all wet?  Yeah, I'm wet.  Okay.  Would you just stay on the phone? 
[02:01:00]  I need a change and my nurse isn't here.  And do you have the phone number?  I'm going to walk across the street now.  Don't hang up.  Don't hang up.  Don't hang up.  Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill.  Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  You sound a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't  talk to you.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey, Bill. 
[02:01:30]  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam?  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a coat, and he said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now.  A lot of cars.  What?  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  Here I go.  I know.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh.  We should have called the police while we had him.  Wasn't doing good.  He's still here.  Call the police.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down the wall.  He dropped the phone.  He did not hang up.  Oh, my God.  Someone called an ambulance.  I think I told you. 
[02:02:30]  Now, this is horrible.  My God, he looks awful.  Gee.  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Somebody call an ambulance.  Help over here.  Somebody got hit.  We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess.  Somebody got hit.  Someone call an ambulance.  Don't touch him.  Leave him down there.  Hello?  Can you give me...  Tell me where you are.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's mad.  Spirit all over the road.  Can you tell me where you are? 
[02:03:00]  It's too late unless you got a shovel.  All right.  We'll get a shovel.  Where are you?  It's too late.  It isn't too late.  It's too late.  What do you mean it's not too late?  It's over there in his hotel.  No.  No.  I can't help you if you won't tell us where you are.  You can't help anymore.  It's a prayer of shovels.  Can you tell me where you are right now? 
[02:03:30]  Disneyland.  In Disneyland.  Can you tell me where in Disneyland?  Pirates of the Caribbean.  And the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.  I'm okay now.  You're okay?  You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine, Bill.  You had me really worried.  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are, Bill?  Jupiter. 
[02:04:00]  On Jupiter.  Planet Jupiter.  Is there a street number or a name on planet Jupiter?  23 Jupiter.  23 Jupiter.  23.  Okay.  Do you live there?  Send a cab.  I would happily send a cab, but just tell me where to send it.  You tell them to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus.  And it's Jupiter, 28 Jupiter.  28?  That's what I said.  Okay.  And what are you doing there now? 
[02:04:30]  Masturbating.  Oh, I see.  Obi and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, I think Brittany needs Ultimate V.  Ultimate V.  That's the problem.  You know what Ultimate V is, Brittany?  Oh, I can only imagine.  What is it?  Ultimate V.  It has all kinds of herbs in it, and it equals the effects of the leading prescription enhancement product.  Do you know what that is? 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  Something I'm in desperate need of.  Ultimate V is a serious product for people who are serious about sex.  It makes good sex, great, and great sex phenomenal.  It's guaranteed no risk.  It works.  The packet fits right in your wallet or pocket.  It's convenient.  The best part, it's for men and women.  You take the Ultimate V.

Jay, that would be great if we were on TV.  Jay Moore doing his Chris Robinson impression in the background. 
[02:06:00]  Ramanie, Ramanie, Ramanie, Ramanie, Ramanie, yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony in the studio, Brittany, and, of course, Jay Moore as well.  Nothing to promote, gentlemen.  I'm in here strictly for the love of the game.  Nice.  Nice.  Strictly for Philadelphia.  Nice, nice, nice.  To represent.  We had Pat Croce on the air yesterday.  That guy's awesome.  He really is awesome.  Jungle guy, too.  Do you know who Pat Croce is, Brittany?  No.  I'm sorry.  Okay, who is that?  Only the most popular guy in Philadelphia. 
[02:06:30]  Well, Allen Iverson's got to be a little more popular than him.  The white guy's always going to win, though.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm serious.  Stalker Patty.  Hey, how are you?  Was she on her hog?  I heard that in APA.  She's kicking over her hog.  She's at the truck pole.  What, Patty?  I heard you were looking for me a half hour ago.  Yeah, what's the noise?  I'm at the Hells Angels Clubhouse getting beat in to the club.  They beat you in.  They pee you in and eff you in. 
[02:07:00]  Come on, man.  It shows what you know.  I made my own mini bike from a lawnmower.  Hi.  Well, anyway, you have to come a long way to get me because I'm in the car.  I'm getting my tattooed property at the chainsaw.  Patty, what?  We don't really care where you are.  What's the noise in the background?  Someone starting up a bike?  Yeah, I'm outside of the Dublin pub.  I see.  Okay.  I'm right out on the street so I can hear because you can't hear inside. 
[02:07:30]  Inside.  How do you get all the way out there?  That's a really long hall with no train stations.  Patty?  Yes?  Oh, it's going to be a nightmare.  In the studio, we got Brittany from Big Brother.  Yeah.  Hi.  And she's a virgin like you.  Oh.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But tell Brittany how old you are.  Uh, I'm 46 years old.  And you've never had the pleasure of the man.  Or displeasure, depending on who you're with. 
[02:08:00]  Well, no, I would have more pleasure in a real relationship with somebody.  That's what Brittany's saying.  Oh, God.  It's you in the future, Brittany.  Have you ever been in a serious relationship?  There's nothing wrong with that.  There really isn't.  Whatever.  That old gag.  Go ahead, Brittany.  You know, when the moment comes, it'll be very special.  Have you been in a relationship with anybody?  I have been out with people, like, on dates and stuff.  But it didn't get past the friendship phase. 
[02:08:30]  And most of my, you know, most of my best friends have always been guys.  In college, whatever.  Uh-huh.  He's explaining your life, Brittany.  Yeah.  Brittany, this is you in the future.  No difference.  Patty, what?  You got to go?  I'm sorry?  Patty said you're off to bike week.  No, it's just somebody's doing their motorcycle out in the middle of the street there.  I don't know how it happened, but I'm now someone's old lady.  I'm now someone's old lady. 
[02:09:00]  I'm being tattooed.  Just listening to the radio and I'm on it.  I'm getting stewed, screwed, and tattooed with my new biker gang friends.  Patty, are you having any beer?  I'm sorry, what?  Are you drinking any beer?  No.  Now, the biker friends we like are crystal meth.  I thought I would tell you something that happened the other night when I went to hear Joe play. 
[02:09:30]  What's that?  I got picked up by a 23-year-old.  So that goes to show you I don't look as bad as I thought.  No, it goes to show you that people drink a lot when my brother plays.  That's about it.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, yeah, Anthony.  The Jägermeister is insane.  Patty, are you trying to say you got action off a 23-year-old?  Well, not action, but he was interested.  I had to inform him of my age, so, and that was it, you know?  Did you allow him to get the stinky pinky?  No. 
[02:10:00]  I know.  White guy?  I'm not going to look past 30 or 32.  Down syndrome?  I'll go up as high as 49 or 50.  Wait, because he was 23, you blew him off?  Well, you called him to leave.  Yeah, he's too young.  I look ridiculous.  Oh, not if you were in love, you'd feel fantastic.  I would feel ridiculous, too.  I'm not a 23-year-old.  I feel silly.  Patty, I have a question for you.  So are you glad that you haven't been intimate with anybody?  What?  If you had it to do over again, would you still not be intimate with anybody? 
[02:10:30]  Are you glad, or do you wish you had somebody?  Well, in a way, I'm glad because they were not the right people for me.  They're not good people or whatever.  I will bet money that Brittany gets laid tonight.  Yeah, this is your future, staring you in the face.  There's also a lack of opportunity.  I didn't get a chance to be in very many places that do very many things because I was in a religious organization, and they kind of curtail your social activities.  Do I make you hoony?  Right.  Hey, Patty. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  Repeat after me.  My name's Brittany, and back in the year 2000, I was on a show called Big Brother.  Funny.  I'm saving myself for the right man to come along in a flying car.  I think I'll meet somebody one of these days.  For some, it comes later.  For some, it comes earlier.  I've just never been lucky enough.  She has a good attitude.  Good attitude.  A 23-year-old drunken guy wanted to bang her, and that's not good enough for Patty. 
[02:11:30]  What the hell is she waiting for?  I don't think that's normal, though, to be 46 and go with a 23-year-old.  I'd feel there was something wrong with me.  She's got a point there.  There is something wrong with me.  You know, I'd like to...  If it was 35 years old, it would be different.  It's older.  You know what I mean?  You girls are overthinking this.  Just go out and get banged.  Getting banged is fun.  Yeah, you're thinking too much.  Oh, drunken Patty.  What?  No, I mean drunken Pat, actually. 
[02:12:00]  Pat from Philly.  What's the problem now?  Is anybody talking to me?  Yeah, you.  Well, you didn't announce yourself that I was on the air.  Wow, you are Philly.  Oh, oh, ouch.  What are you doing to this girl?  What girl?  What's the problem?  This little...  Oh, God.  Pat.  Yeah?  We're talking to Stalker Patty.  She's a 46-year-old virgin.  And Brittany, of course, who's a virgin in the studio.  The 26-year-old virgin.  The 26-year-old.  Brittany who?  We are showing Brittany what it's going to be like 20 years from now. 
[02:12:30]  Wait a minute.  What is...  Who is Brittany?  I lost...  Brittany, we've got to go back to the future.  Hey, Pat.  I've got to show you your dried-up old satchel.  What a mess.  Patty, I...  It looks like a robin bag.  Patty, congratulations.  I heard you got a raise at McDonald's.  A what?  You got a promotion at McDonald's.  A promotion? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Well, you're...  I didn't get a promotion.  That's what we heard.  You're now working the soft drink section, right?  Oh, who said that?  You went from the friolator to the soft drinks?  Well, I'm trying to push my application across the street in the hard rock instead.  Oh, a little...  Oh, you get two people battling and you learn something.  You negotiate with some leverage.  Hey, Stalker Patty, slow down.  Yeah.  I'm pitting them against each other. 
[02:13:30]  The Big Mac against the Whopper.  And my dusty old cave hasn't seen either.  I have my sights set on syndication.  And I won't stop.  Isn't that amazing?  She's fighting for where she's going to work.  I can't slow down for a 23-year-old.  I can do it half an hour, isn't it?  I feel silly going out with such a young man.  I want our great pubes slapping together. 
[02:14:00]  You know, I just don't want to end up like Cher and have a toy boy, you know?  Don't worry ever about ending up like Cher.  Do you believe in love and love?  Yeah, that's for you.  I'm pretty sure I'll meet the right guy soon, you know?  If I could turn back time, if I could find a way, I'd have gotten late.  I'm getting tattoos on my ass, but now it looks like when you pick up the comics with silly putty and stretch it out. 
[02:14:30]  It looks like an explosion at the Rorschach test factory.  All right, Patty, we're going to let you go.  Okay.  You have a good day.  Bye.  Bye, Brittany.  Bye.  I'll see you.  Bye, O.C.  Bye, bye, party.  Bye, Patty.  Bye, have a great day.  I've got to give this guy a spot.  I'm going to get on the back of a hog.  Oh, she seems sweet.  Oh.  She is sweet. 
[02:15:00]  I like her.  Oh.  Look at you playing up to Brittany.  No, I do.  Like, I don't know what you're doing.  I'm going to be in hot cycle, bitch, next week.  All naked, flashing from the back of a hog.  Does she have a hat for one of you or both of you or just...  She really likes Opie and now she's going to all kinds of appearances that we do and she's  getting a lot more loose.  Like, when she first came in here, she was totally straight-laced.  Now she's naked. 
[02:15:30]  She takes her top off.  Yeah, she's, like, wilder than you.  We've seen her completely naked.  Well, okay, now I'm confused.  It's not that horrific.  Go get the picture right now.  I saw it.  I looked it up from my L.A. home.  She's a 46-year-old virgin for religious reasons and then she would get naked in here.  Well, that was years ago.  She didn't do it because of religion.  What religious sex was she in?  Right.  I'm a prince Davidian.  No, what was it?  Did she ever open up about it?  I don't know.  We'll have to ask her next time.  I didn't ask because I figured you guys already knew. 
[02:16:00]  No, it was something.  No, it was Catholic.  She did tell us.  Catholics are the ones that really effed the whole situation, huh?  It was definitely a Catholic religion.  Oh, wow.  The Greeks tell you to have sex and you'll go to hell.  Meanwhile, they're fondling young boys.  Great, great religion.  George Carlin said he was Catholic until he reached the age of reason.  That's good.  It was good.  Mike, what's going on?  Do you know who George Carlin is?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Fantastic.  She doesn't know who George Carlin is.  Oh, I'm going to make her into chicken pie yard.  Hold on, Mike.  Hold on.  What?  Go ahead.  I'm going to make her into chicken pie yard the way I'm pounding her. 
[02:16:30]  What a mallet you're about to get.  She never knows who anyone is.  I love it.  Thank God.  I'm a girl so out of the show business loop.  She's completely out.  I love it.  You know how sexy that is?  George Carlin, you really don't know who he is?  It's like being a baseball player and going out with a girl that knows nothing about baseball.  Yeah, he's a sports guy.  He's just funny with a sports guy.  George Carlin's like a, what status would he be at?  Legend.  A comedy legend.  Like the Dice Man's a legend.  One of the all-time greatest. 
[02:17:00]  Richard Pryor is the all-time greatest.  Have you heard of him?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, that's good because he's the all-time funniest man in the world.  Okay.  I don't know.  What about Red Fox?  Richard Pryor, man.  Richard Pryor was doing...  Richard Pryor...  You know what?  It's kind of hard to make a burn unit in a hospital into a 15-minute hilarious routine.  That set list was getting set on fire while smoking crack, going to the hospital in the burn unit  and having his skin peeled off, smoking more crack, putting the shades up, shooting his wife's car.  Well, thank God it didn't have an effect on his life now. 
[02:17:30]  No, I'm just saying.  It's like when you look at it on paper, if you steal somebody's set list off the stage  and it says heart attack on the front lawn, you're going, well, that doesn't seem that funny.  Maybe that's a good blues song or something.  Maybe some country-western ditty that the kid from the real world might do.  Original virgin, speaking of virgins.  I'm picking up coast-to-coast flights on the radar right now.  I'm going to tie the whole thing together.  The kid on the real world, that big Texan, he was a virgin also.  John, was that his name?  I don't know his name.  I just know he was the gayest man I've ever seen in my life.  He was the guy virgin on the real world LA. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, but he was gay.  You could totally tell he was hiding behind the Lord to, you know, to mask his homosexuality.  Hiding behind the Lord.  Brittany?  Yeah?  Are you into girls?  No.  No, she's not.  No, I haven't.  She's about it all swinging.  She likes that.  Yeah?  Mike, who hung up...  He-bagging.  Mike, who hung up, wanted Harry Carey to try to convince Brittany to have sex.  I swear to God, that's what he was going to say.  Who are you?  Do you have any idea who Harry Carey is?  Do you know Harry Carey?  Okay, I know the name, but I can't picture it. 
[02:18:30]  What do you think he does for a living?  If you guessed, like you guessed George Carlin was a musician.  What'd she say?  Sports guy.  Sports guy.  Sports guy.  He's a comedian.  Sports guy.  Okay, Harry, an actor?  Yeah.  From here to eternity.  I mean, I've heard of Harry Carey.  I just can't...  Have you heard of Burt Lancaster?  Yes.  He's an announcer for the Cubs.  Okay, I've heard of...  No, you've just heard of the act of Harry Carey, which is in Japan committing suicide.  No?  No, no.  Oh, I was giving her the benefit of the doubt, and what the hell do I know? 
[02:19:00]  You know, Brittany, there's one thing I've noticed in my travels through life, and I've  sat at the end of many of pubs, too, and at the end of a bar, whether it'd be made out  of oak or have a brass rail running straight down the side and place the rest of your elbows  when you're knocking back an ice-cold black-blue ribbon, you can't open your leg, sweetheart,  and welcome in all the wonderful things the good Lord in this world has to offer. 
[02:19:30]  There's ball, wasn't it, Grace?  Because as you understand this lifetime, Brittany, it's all about getting your next piece of ass.  A man just jumped out of a helicopter out to the playing field, shattering both of tibulas  and tibulas.  Those are prehistoric dinosaurs shouting, man.  Do you know, of course, tibia backwards is Motel Inn.  That man's not going anywhere.  Brittany, hey, have sex with John Sterling. 
[02:20:00]  That's awful.  New York Yankee announcers.  Sounds like an old gay man.  How about Bob Shepard?  Or Bob Murphy?  Bob, get in on some of this 26-year-old virgin ass.  Well, I've got to tell you, Harry, I'd get a couple of balls on her.  Well, I can only offer her one ball. 
[02:20:30]  But hey, Philadelphia loves Harry's carry.  Because in a country, the older team are consistently worse than the Philadelphia Phillies.  Or in first place.  Now they are.  Of course.  Yeah.  Terry Francona turned it all around.  How about those Mets?  The Mets are awful.  Did I just see Hideki Arabu pitching in Yankee Stadium last night?  It was iron acid.  That fat jab to see that guy again in that room, let alone in the pinstripes, almost made me kick in my TV set and get on the C train to the Bronx. 
[02:21:00]  You know what it says?  If you look at scouting reports, it doesn't even say, like, it mentions nothing.  You know, I'm a sports fanatic.  It mentions nothing about his ability.  It says he's got a fastball with great movement.  But guys don't play well behind him because he's so slow and deliberate and takes so much time in between pitches.  He will kill you.  Yeah.  Many errors. 
[02:21:30]  It says expect many errors.  Like, you're such a piece of dog crap that your own teammates are like, oh, it's hit to me.  Oh, my bad.  You know what?  I'm out of it.  Dude, I'm out of it.  Where are we?  Dodger Stadium?  This is really a nice place.  I was just looking around.  That ball hit me in the nuts.  But this jab is putting me to sleep out here.  Yeah, I want a big, fat jab to sit on my face.  Put the big jab out of my face, Norton.  You don't know what you're missing until you get teabagged by a big, fat jab. 
[02:22:00]  Carlos, Norton.  Get his donkey down here.  He works at Hong Kong Gardens.  He watches dishes at Hong Kong Gardens.  Britney Loudmouth.  Do you have any idea who we're impersonating right now?  Do you know who that was?  No idea.  Do you know anything?  Oh, my God.  Were you raising a Skinner box?  What the hell are you...  I'm coming highbrow, too, Philly.  I've heard of a honeymooner.  Oh, okay.  You ever watch it?  No.  No, I hear the...  Who's never watched a honeymooner? 
[02:22:30]  Me.  But it's funny.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  All right.  Oh, look, where are the viewers?  Where are the pots?  Pots hot, Betty boy, Betty boy.  Clear the fields.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  You got a pitch pipe?  You got a pitch pipe?  That's good.  I like that.  That's one of the best things I've ever seen.  Are they going to do drugs?  Oh, God.  That's some of the...  Just the way he points, like a split second after he's supposed to... 
[02:23:00]  Everything's going real fast.  Oh, wow.  Look at Brittany, she's lost.  We could be talking about quantum physics.  No, but she's really enjoying it, right?  You think it's funny.  It's funny.  Yeah, right.  You're having fun.  You know what?  She's the perfect Buddhist student.  Right.  She doesn't pretend to have more water in her glass.  It's tabula rasa, as they would say in philosophy, which means clean slate.  Clean slate.  It's a psychology interpretation.  But...  Now her eyes are spinning around in her head. 
[02:23:30]  What's happening?  Right.  But she's willing to be filled with knowledge.  She's not, you know...  That's about all she's willing to be filled with, unfortunately.  Oh, man.  It is high.  It is far.  Big fly.  Bye-bye.  Anthony, come around.  Oh, wait.  No, that was caught.  Wait, wait, wait.  You know, I thought it was caught the second I left the fire.  The only person it wasn't for was Henry Rodriguez.  And he's the one that...  He's the one that...  You know, Bush Husky is not an attractive man. 
[02:24:00]  But he's black and has freckles.  I don't get it.  I thought black people had a natural position towards sunlight.  That's why they had so much melanin in their body.  Big McBride gets hit in the testicles.  With a fastball on the catcher.  Beats him over the head with his old bat.  Wow, I've never seen that before.  Big McBride getting brained on the dish.  You know, fans, you've got to have sex with a 26-year-old... 
[02:24:30]  I know, I feel like Little Nicky.  What are you doing?  I'm doing Harry Carrey.  Do you know who Little Nicky is?  Little Nicky.  No, I do not.  Adam Sandler.  Adam Sandler.  Do you know who Adam Sandler is?  Oh, we got one, right?  We got one.  You adore him.  He's funny.  Yeah, that's right he is.  He's funny.  Little Nicky.  Who do you like music-wise?  What bands do you like?  I like Bjork.  I like the Beastie Boys.  Bajork.  I like the song Happy Birthday and, you know, stuff like the standards. 
[02:25:00]  And you know what she does now?  She interviews people on AOL, like bands and stuff.  And they tell her who she's interviewing.  She goes, hey, can I get a bio?  No, I can say.  How can you interview people if you're knowledge-less?  Oh, I am not knowledge-less.  No, about the person.  No, no, no.  I mean, we don't...  Who wrote Swanee River?  It's funny.  And not...  And not...  Swanee River?  These guys are horrible.  We're not making it funny.  We're just recording the honeymooners.  That's all we're doing. 
[02:25:30]  And not...  And we're trusting that the guys that, you know, paint houses all day are driving home  right now are just stoned enough to be on this wavelength and make their drive through  Philly that much better.  They cruise through Villanova and look at those spoiled, bratty, rich kids with their  Irocs and their BMWs that their parents bought.  And when you're putting in a good, hard day's work, busting your ass for some seed money  and then some seed money, if you dig me, Philly, and yeah, I've been there, so don't lie  to me either, all right?  You don't buy Rolexes on Broad Street, all right?  By big, fat sacks of the crow neck. 
[02:26:00]  All right?  So, Philly...  Oh, my God!  No, I'm just explaining the show a little bit, because a lot of people are pissed off  in Philly that some music has been taken off the airwaves.  And then my argument is, is any music you miss when you're listening to radio, you own  the CD anyway.  Right.  That's why you enjoy listening to it.  Yeah.  Bring your CD from your structure that you live in into the structure you move around  the neighborhood in.  It's incredible how you can listen to Ricky Martin 50 times a day in your own car.  You know Ricky Martin, Brittany?  Yes. 
[02:26:30]  He's dreaming.  You know Britney Spears, Brittany?  Yes.  Do you know Radiohead?  Do you know who's nuts?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm better with music, so...  I just don't know...  Do you know Chet Baker?  You know Adam Ferrara?  You ever see the show The Job?  You know Dennis Leary?  I'm Dennis Leary.  Do you know Chet Baker?  Mm-mm.  No.  Jazz?  Miles Davis?  No.  Oh, God.  I'm going to plug in you with a shovel now.  The sexual attraction has just ended.  Aw.  No, it hasn't.  I'm just joking. 
[02:27:00]  Of course you have.  I've got to keep on our toes, man.  We have to take a break, guys.  In case of emergency.  We've got Radiohead tickets to give away.  Aw, sweet.  They're good.  We've got two pairs of tickets to see Radiohead with special guests, the Beta Band and Kid Koala  at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey on Friday, August 17th.  Before you can buy them, this is the band's only area appearance.  Look at that.  Tickets for both the August 16th and 17th shows go on sale through all Ticketmaster Outlets  and the Hammerstein Ballroom Box Office. 
[02:27:30]  What label are they on?  I don't know.  EMI.  EMI.  Okay, right.  This capital is nice to you guys, too.  I heard you guys were giving away that Dave Navarro before it's available.  You guys got your hands on some major goodies this time.  Aw, yeah.  Now it's happening.  Look what Radiohead tickets, Dave Navarro.  I went to Virgin today.  I was like, why isn't it Dave?  Where's the Dave Navarro now?  The guy playing for James Addison?  They're coming aboard, the record companies.  Give me the phonograph.  The guy wrote Ocean's.  A couple pairs of tickets to see Radiohead.  Give us a call. 
[02:28:00]  877-692-1027.  Saturday Night, starting at 7, WNEW gives you Weez.  Hey, what's up, Weezer?  And Cheese.  Cheese, my, Mary, my.  7 to 10, it's Brother Weez, endorsed by Opie and Anthony.  At 10, Eddie Trunk cranks out the best variety of metal.  And cheesy hair bands on Saturday Night Rocks.  It's Weez.  Nice.  And Cheese.  107, WNEW. 
[02:28:30]  Anthony Sam Adams.  Yes.  The passion and independence in brewing.  It produced some of the best beer in the world.  And that beer, Sam Adams.  The Summer Ale.  That's what you got to do now.  You go into the beach.  Maybe you go into a show and you're going to tailgate for a while in the parking lot.  Load up that cooler with some Summer Ale.  Anthony, where is your Sam Adams today?  It's right next to him.  It's right next to him.  I've been drinking.  Always keep your Sam Adams right by your side, fans.  Don't let the old guy know. 
[02:29:00]  He's right on the label for you.  There's my hell of a Sam.  They're still beating Rick Ruschel in the face with his old bat.  I don't get it.  They're really mad at Rick Ruschel.  Just bludgeoning his face with a baseball bat after he butted that ball foul down the line.  Time for Sam Adams, Bob.  What do you say?  Sam Adams.  There's nothing else to do.  A guy's getting his face beat in with a bat.  Great tasting, Summer Ale.  Try it.  Sam Adams. 
[02:29:30]  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Want me to get Rick Robinson again?  No, no, no.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Is that perfect circle or cool?  Perfect circle.  That's hot.  I run for that.  I run for that.  I run for that.  Anthony, when I run around, you know when I put on my shorts and I run around?  Yeah.  I run for that.  Anthony, guess what I run for?  I run for that.  Perfect circles? 
[02:30:00]  I heard...  You listen to the perfect circles?  Yeah.  I run for that.  877-692-1027 is our phone number, our last break of the day here.  I heard when Jay was playing last night.  Where were you last night?  In Jersey, right?  Yeah, Rascals.  Yeah, and you had some of the audience there from Regis and Kelly?  Yeah.  Because they buy some tickets.  Now, they saw you on Regis and Kelly guest hosting for Regis last week.  Here's the kind of drama I have now.  Like, I got the fans that buy tickets no matter what.  Like, from you guys. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Mostly.  And, you know, Jim Roman, the West Coast, and whoever.  That helped me sell tickets.  And those people know what they're getting into, you know.  Right.  But now I host Regis and Kelly.  And more people watch that than the goddamn Super Bowl, apparently.  Regis and Kelly.  It's in my intro for crying out loud.  You've seen them on Regis and Kelly.  They're like, oh, that's right.  So they see you being all nice.  Out of like a three...  Yes.  And Regis and Kelly, we all know, is a nice, clean show.  Right.  Early.  I'm making old ladies and housewives laugh.  But, you know, if my friend...  He's so handsome and so nice and so funny. 
[02:31:00]  And they have great chemistry.  Yes.  I got to see his show.  Look, he's going to be in Jersey.  But they're excited because Regis and Kelly, as we know, is an enormous show.  Very successful show.  So these people, they think they're onto something, and they are.  It's a show.  So they buy the tickets right away.  Yeah.  But 30% of the audience on 350 people are there because they see me on this nice G-rated morning show.  Uh-oh.  I start talking about, you know, digits in the Netherlands, and suddenly their faces go a little ashen. 
[02:31:30]  No, you're talking about your face buried in the back area.  Of my wife.  Of your wife.  That's what makes a real man.  If you're not willing to do that, man, you ain't a man.  You'll never lose an argument while you're doing that.  You will never not be the man in the house when you're face first in that.  How could you not be?  Who else would be doing that?  Only a man would do that.  And she looks over her shoulder like, what?  She doesn't know whether to back up or throw up.  But back up is winning.  A back up is always winning, isn't it? 
[02:32:00]  Right, Britt?  Yeah, baby.  You know.  Come on.  She knows what you're talking about.  That's right, sucker.  What do you think, Brittany?  Nice, right?  Nice.  Very nice.  I have the same problem when I host the show, Jay.  Of course, when I'm on there as Regis on the show, I'm very nice.  The women love me.  But then I get out and I start talking about effing girls in the A and sing all over their  backs, Gellman.  Your callback is much different than your television personality, Regis. 
[02:32:30]  A lot different.  I go into, I break into song numbers.  Of course, I do a lot of the standards.  But then I'm not against talking about maybe a load of C.  You got glazed in a woman's face.  You got to make a map of Hawaii, Gellman.  You know, my Gleason and Regis are too close together.  I got to just stick with Gleason.  I start, I actually go to the stagehands and say, could you pick like a motley crew?  I go, get her in the back.  Get her.  Get that girl.  Well, I saw the one in the front row was very hot. 
[02:33:00]  The blonde, bring her back.  I got to bang something, Gellman.  I got to bang Gellman.  You know who we're talking about?  Do you know Regis Philbin?  Yes.  Britney?  Yes, I don't know.  You've done two of the highest rated shows in the history of the modern television.  Yes, I know.  Who wants to be a co-co-a?  Know what's funny about that, Anthony?  We're starting to get the what did we learn together?  Yeah.  Jerry from Edison writes, chronic virginity leads to an inability to know anything about celebrity.  It is, I actually read that in my medical book. 
[02:33:30]  It's right after your girl chart.  Oh, the girl chart.  Ziggy went out.  Girl chart.  Girl chart.  Hold on, we got to stop the show for a second because Keith the Cop is bringing Ziggy,  the homeless guy from our homeless shopping spree.  You know this guy, Ziggy, just played the ball in all fields.  I see him riding around in the village outside the Boston Cavity Club holding that 40 of malt liquor  like it's a football.  Looks like Rick Monday bowing over Manny Trio at third base.  I've never seen anyone carry a bottle of beer like this guy. 
[02:34:00]  Samuel Adams.  Hey, you know what the best thing is?  Jay bought a pizza.  He went to...  Two pizzas.  Two pizzas.  And Ziggy was able to indulge in some of the pizza.  It was like filet mignon.  Ziggy, you like the pizza?  Did you have a good...  You like the pizza, Zig?  Yeah, I have one pizza pizza.  That's it?  You should have loaded up, man.  I also heard that you saw...  Line your shoes with that stuff.  That's a simple job by everybody else, makes everybody else have one.  Oh, look at that.  That's a good man.  That's a good guy.  That's a good man. 
[02:34:30]  Doesn't even know where his next meal is coming from, but he's worried about everyone else  getting a piece.  Would you like my crust?  Did you like my crust?  No, Jay.  Do you want his?  Jay, put it in the garbage can.  He'll feel more at home.  Oh, God damn, Opie.  You've got to take it to that level.  God damn, that was funny.  Listen, Ziggy, we love you.  You know that.  Ziggy.  Hand him cash right now.  Ziggy.  Hand him full of cash, you bastard.  We will.  We're done.  Ziggy, you saw Jay on Regis, right? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did he do a good job?  Yeah, I used to watch that a couple times.  And sometimes he gets spooky, right?  A little spooky?  A million dollars.  I saw a kid make a million dollars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a little spooky when you get up and get a million dollars.  Yeah, you start getting spooky.  He's cross-pollinizing his shows.  Now, Regis does that two shows.  We've got to bring it down a little bit because Ziggy's got to go,  but he wants to sing a little song before.  All right, Ziggy. 
[02:35:30]  Sing a little number.  Sing a little number.  Get around and sing it.  You sing good.  We heard you sing Silent Night.  We're going to sing it together?  All right, you start off.  Get closer to the microphone.  Duets.  I'll say, oh, take that, you see?  Yeah, there you go.  That's a good one.  Get your mouth.  That's patriotic.  Get your mouth real close to the microphone.  That's patriotic.  I'll do it on this one.  You do it on that one, okay?  Go ahead, Ziggy.  Anybody?  Do you want me to count you guys in?  Yeah, go ahead, Ziggy.  Go ahead, guys.  Oh, say, can you? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Oh, say, can you see?  By the dawn's early light  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  So proud.  Take your hat off, Ziggy.  The broad stripes and bright stars  Through the perilous fight  For the rampart we won  Was so gallantly streaming 
[02:36:30]  That's a hard part.  And the rocket's red glare  That was bursting in air  Gave proof through the night  That our flag was still there  Oh, say, does that star-strangled banner wave  Big closer.  Of the land of the sea 
[02:37:00]  And the world of the brave  Excuse me, but I do believe that stuff has  I have a tear in my eye.  Open up your walls to Ziggy.  Come on. 
[02:37:30]  Give him cash.  Your way to go doesn't get him far, fella.  Why don't you hand him a ten, you cheap bastard?  Isn't that just the most sad, ironic thing  That a man who has not been able to function  As this country deems the proper way  And use the country to all the advantages  It just knows all the way  It's like that old homeless commercial  They used to run on TV  Yeah  Where they had that going  And showing the homeless people  All over the street  Oh, my God  Is that the one with the crying Indian  And the litter?  No, that was the garbage one.  The garbage. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, I run to that, too.  Look at an Indian crying about the garbage.  I run to that.  Grab some whiskey.  Drunk Indian, drunk Indian.  Yes, sir.  Bye, Keith the cop.  Thank you very much.  Tony, what's up?  Yeah, I was wondering  Did you guys mention Testy's child  Getting booed off the stage last night?  I missed it.  Shocking.  Yeah, I missed it  Because I was too busy seeing  J. Moore Rascals last night.  Where were they?  It was the halftime  Of the basketball game.  I just want to  I want to salute 
[02:38:30]  Every single Philadelphian  For doing that.  Oh, without a doubt.  I respect Philly just for that.  I hear a couple of the girls  Were in L.A. colors.  One of them was in L.A. colors, right, Tony?  Yeah, one of them was in L.A.  And then she's crying.  Left the floor crying.  She left the floor crying.  What a homo.  What did she expect?  And I mean, Beyonce, the lead singer  She was in just NBA attire.  Right.  But, I mean, I don't think  She would have been able to fit  Into, like, 76 her attire.  Her rear end  It took up the whole stage. 
[02:39:00]  Good.  That's what I want  Out of my black women.  Well, you gotta have the big bootie.  That's what I like her.  You know what?  I'm glad she got booed off  Because she's going to need  Somebody to spank her  For giving such a bad performance.  Somebody's going to have to  Spank that big black ass.  So, kudos to third outfit.  That's all I gotta say.  Thanks for booing her.  All right, Tony.  We deserve you guys.  Thank you.  That's when I like to meet the ladies  Right when their self-esteem plummets.  You got booed off?  Come talk to me.  You're the best.  I'll reshape you.  Sorry.  That's okay. 
[02:39:30]  Richard.  Yes.  Richard Jenny.  Yes.  Richard Jenny.  Yes.  What's up, man?  Who am I talking to?  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Big stars right here on my phone.  Oh, yeah.  That's awesome, right?  Jay Moore's in the studio.  What's up, Rich?  And Brittany from that fine show  Big Brother that no one watched last year.  Oh, my God.  You ever watch that show, Rich?  All the time.  And if you believe me,  then I'm lying.  So, what's up, Rich?  I'm working at Caroline's this weekend.  Yeah, I know.  And I wanted everybody to know. 
[02:40:00]  And I figured I'd go on  the biggest, most gigantic,  throbbing, turgid show  in New York and mention it.  Comes right out with the plug, too.  I like that.  God bless him.  Gotta respect that.  This is a guy that had  an hour of material 15 years ago.  Oh, my God.  No, I'm saying, like...  No, he meant that as a compliment, right?  Really?  Of course I meant it as a compliment.  It certainly didn't sound like one.  No, this guy, like, 20...  He's been in comedy.  He's like a legend.  And this guy's got so much comedy.  Oh, okay.  You see...  You can literally go see  11 different hours of Richard Jenny. 
[02:40:30]  As I got that,  it was that he hasn't  come up with anything new  in 15 years.  Quite the contrary.  You took it in a negative way.  No, you know I'm all  about the positivity, man.  Okay.  Richard's a good man.  You took it in a negative way.  I don't...  I never know what to take from Jay.  I don't know.  What's wrong with Jay?  You know, it's not like  you comics treat each other nicely.  I love Jay more.  We like each other.  Can I just say this right now?  And I don't think  I'm talking out of school  about Jay.  What?  And you know this.  I can't lie.  Is that okay, Jay?  That's absolutely fine. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, just bring back  all those gay jokes  that'll be piling up  at Jay's Express.  No, there was a time  me and him were at  Catch a Rising Star  in Princeton  and, you know,  he told me  there was only one room,  yada, yada, yada, so...  Oh, really?  Yeah, me and Richard...  You hooked up.  And before you know it,  it was me and Jay Moore.  And then it was you  and Larry Amaros.  And now he's a big movie star  and I'm begging  Ron and Ron  to please call  Polky and Anthony.  It's Ron and Fez now.  I don't even know  the guy's show.  Richard,  it's Ron and Fez now. 
[02:41:30]  But listen,  let me tell you something.  Fifteen years ago,  those guys had an hour  of material.  No.  No, they didn't.  All right, Richard,  where are you going to be?  I'm going to be a...  Oh, my God.  Oh, you guys are horrible.  I had nothing to do  with that, man.  Look at my hands.  Come on, Jay Moore.  Come on.  Jay, I can't believe  you did that, man.  Why would you hang up  on Richard Jenny, Jay Moore?  I did not hang up  on Richard Jenny.  Jay reached over  and hung up  the phone.  I thought you guys  were friends.  We are,  and I did not hang up 
[02:42:00]  on Richard Jenny,  stupid ass.  One of us sits behind  a switchboard  and it ain't me.  And I'll bet the audience  a million dollars  one of their names  is either Opie or Anthony.  You have a long reach.  You reached right over.  If I reach...  Dikembe Mutombo  couldn't touch that.  Chewbacca.  We play very well.  I need comp drop.  Oh, is he back?  Yeah.  Okay.  Richard.  Richard.  Where'd you go?  We apologize. 
[02:42:30]  There's something wrong  with the phone system.  They just got a new  phone system in here.  They handle the  syndicated audience.  Yes.  Do they realize  who you are?  I know.  I know.  Apparently not.  So, Richard,  where are you going  to be this weekend?  I'm going to be  at Carol.  Oh, I cannot believe  you did that again.  You're horrible.  Hey.  It's funny  because it's not me.  Jay can't even...  Jay's barely cracking  a smile.  Jay, this is funny stuff.  It's horrible.  You're a sick bastard, Jay. 
[02:43:00]  I know, but you guys...  At least you can laugh  after you hang up  on the guy.  A man's got to  make a living.  That guy's got  kids to feed.  That guy's got to  pay for a comb  and suits, you know?  Come on.  I can't believe  that happened.  He's got to go  for three.  He's got to go  for three.  Come on.  He could have just  taken a grand  out of that guy's  house back.  You can't hang up  on him again.  No.  Trifecta.  Come on.  Trifecta.  Please, he falls  right again.  Oh, it's ringing. 
[02:43:30]  I left.  Richard?  Richard?  Yeah.  Are you there?  Yes, I am.  Son of a bitch.  Friggin' phones, man.  All right.  It's happened...  No, it's happened  three times.  We had a guy  from Survivor on earlier.  He had a call  back twice  and we were trying  to get the story  about how he was  sprayed in the face  with the pepper spray  today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just want to say  bye to you guys  and bye to Jay.  Richard.  No, plug the gig, man.  No, I'm not.  You do it.  I actually don't  know the date. 
[02:44:00]  Okay.  No, honestly.  You can't get a kid  in the room.  All right.  It was funny  the first time.  He's too smart  for you guys.  Jenny's too smart  for you too.  It was funny  the first time.  No, come on.  It was mildly  amusing the second time.  I know.  That was in poor taste.  I'm not going to say  that I'm going to be  at Caroline's this week.  The triple.  The triple.  Wow, that was  a quick figure.  Wow, that looked like  Floyd Mayweather's jab 
[02:44:30]  the way you hit that button.  Snap.  Snap.  If he has the balls  to call back  within the next couple minutes  we'll let him do his plug.  No, we'll have him  on the show tomorrow.  Okay, we can do that.  Because then  we understand  that he gets our show.  He's got a call back.  Goddamn, that hurts so bad  being on the other end of that.  I can't believe  how fast he got to it.  I know.  What?  Not faster than  Opie's finger, though.  No, that's what I'm talking about.  Opie was like  leaning back in his chair  drinking his water.  Bonk. 
[02:45:00]  So the CIA agent  Peter Falk  in the in-laws.  I'm the classic agency  tight.  Compact, low to the ground,  strong.  Are you interested in joining?  I tell you,  the benefits are phenomenal.  The key is to not get killed.  That is really the key  to enjoying the benefits.  Tony, Tony.  What's up, guys?  Jay, you're a sick man.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, we love the guy.  I learned Salker Patty  got effed and beaten  into a biker gang.  Beaten in.  And Brittany is a waste of talent.  Thank you, Tony.  Later, fellas. 
[02:45:30]  Like leaving a Ferrari  locked up in the garage.  Hey, that guy's got  a good point, man.  Giservoir from Brooklyn.  Today I learned  Lola's mother, Robin,  was quivering.  That's right.  She was.  What?  Lola was at my show last night.  Oh, I know.  Her mom's name  is really Robin.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's funny.  That was a pun on words?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was two-thirds  of a pun.  P-U.  Yeah.  Robin's quivering.  Come on.  Where the hell  is Richard? 
[02:46:00]  She's not calling back.  Oh, we're killing time now?  We're three times the charm.  Come on, Richard.  Call back.  Come on.  You guys hurt his feelings.  Aw.  No, he'll get word  that you want him to call back.  Yeah.  George, what's up?  Hey, man, I can't believe  you did that.  A quick one that I learned?  Yeah.  You are a dick.  Yeah.  Where are you going  to be this weekend, sir?  Let's go to Adam.  Adam, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Well, just now I learned  that there's nothing funnier  than an Opie and Anthony  initiation. 
[02:46:30]  That's right, baby.  He was beat in.  If you could survive that...  I tied a whole show together.  Look at that, Anthony.  Brought it right back.  Anthony tied the whole show together.  Brought it back and on.  If Richard could survive that,  then you know what?  We welcome him  with open arms.  He's on.  He's a good guy.  All right, what else, Adam?  I learned that even Harry Carey  can't get Britney laid.  You know, I do the best I can.  You bring in guys  with the big lumber  like Lenny Randall  and Ray Burris.  Guys that you know  are going to deliver  the goods upon arrival. 
[02:47:00]  These guys sure love  the Samuel Adams.  Hey, Opie.  Wow, Mike Jorgensen  is still getting beaten  about the face and the neck  with his own back.  Now they're beating  his face in with the cleats.  I'm trying to get  Dick Tedrow  balls deep.  Nothing's going.  All right, let me go  to Uncle John here.  I don't know what.  His name was Michael.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that  Richard Jennings  is going to be a carrot. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  That guy was sharp.  You always like to see  a smart fan  as Jose Cardinal  loses his pants  and control of his bowels  in between second and third.  That guy came with the port,  got it across,  and got his joke out,  hung up on himself.  You love to see  that self-esteem.  You don't want to  clean that up.  And Jose Cardinal  was out in the base pad,  pulled up his pants,  stopped running  and tagged out. 
[02:48:00]  Covered in his own faces  as he walks  his way back  into the dugout.  Of course,  nobody wants to sit  next to a guy  that just exploded  diarrhea all over himself  between second  and third base.  But here's a guy  that's stupid  to get caught  in a rundown,  but has the right  of mind  to pull down  his pants  before he sprays  diarrhea.  Opie?  Yeah.  Today, I learned  if Joe and Ann  did the OJ song  today,  it would be  to the Patty Duke  theme.  Of course. 
[02:48:30]  Jerry, real fast.  He learned  Eddie's out there  taking care of people  seven and a half  inches at a time.  He also learned  Jay Moore and Ziggy  were separated at birth.  People drink way  too much  when Brother Joe plays.  Stalker Patty  will soon be syndicated  to McDonald's  in 22 markets.  And finally,  George Carlin  is now doing  mornings at  WNAW.  Yeah.  Sports guy.  Let me go to  Tony Camacho.  What's with  the Phillies?  Tony.  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  I just wanted  to make a comment  about Rich Jenny. 
[02:49:00]  Jenny is so funny  I wanted to just  qualify what  Jay was saying  about him.  Can you put me  on the air?  You're on, buddy.  You're on.  I am.  What's up, Tony?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean,  what you're saying  is that years ago  when everybody  was just starting out,  Jenny had more  material than anybody  and the guy,  in my opinion,  and you know me,  I've been doing this  for 20 years.  Jay, and this  is our competition,  Caroline, but  Jenny is one  of the funniest  men in comedy.  So would you like  to plug Richard's gig? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, I would.  I would,  because he's a cat.  That would be  pretty white of you,  Tony.  Let's go.  He's a cat.  But he got you first.  I know he did.  He killed you, man.  Oh, man.  He caught the dodgeball  right in your face.  He caught the dodgeball.  You think it's just  going to bounce up?  Tony Camacho  came strong.  Probably just got done  shaving his head.  Feels all good.  He's nice and so fresh  and so clean  in a Cadillac. 
[02:50:00]  And he calls up the show  to defend Rich Denny  and then he lets  hope you have it.  Nailed.  Caught the dodgeball on you.  I was listening  the other day,  Ed,  that was a good job  when you were  explaining the dodgeball.  The ball always had that  Yeah,  but it wasn't a void  like Rick said.  That was those  red rubber balls.  Yeah,  with a yellow dot.  Isn't that weird?  I just...  Yeah.  Yeah,  and sometimes  like when they went  to blow it up  the needle would break off  and be stuck inside  so it would go  so the blind kids  wouldn't miss it  and kickball.  That was the worst. 
[02:50:30]  They could hear it rolling.  I would always end up  turned around  in dodgeball  and then you're like  oh God,  I can't turn back around  and you're afraid  to turn around  because the second  you're facing  that direction again  the ball is an inch  from your face  doing about 80.  Boom.  You're out!  Kill me!  Get out of the sideline!  We've got to end  the show for Philly.  Yeah,  we're done.  I was a Terminator  in dodgeball.  I bet.  We'll continue  because you're a nasty man.  I am a nasty man.  We'll continue  for New York,  okay?  All right,  a little bit. 
[02:51:00]  Thank you,  Philadelphia.  Philadelphia.  We'll see you tomorrow  for FU Friday.  Hi,  this is Reverend  Jesse Jackson  and you're listening  to Opie and Anthony  on the WNHW is  The Sports Guys  at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  It's the Radio Chick.  One of my favorite guests  of all time  coming back in.  Dr. Drew!  Heard every weeknight  at 11 o'clock  right here on WNHW.  Next to you guys  we're at 11 o'clock.  Yeah,  we've always tried  to work a little magic here.  We don't carry a lot of clout 
[02:51:30]  but all of a sudden  you were here  and the next day  you were on at 11 o'clock.  All you gotta do  is get my badge involved  and things get done.  The Radio Chick  weekdays 9 to noon  102.7  WNEW  Anthony,  really fast,  what did we learn today?  G from Jersey,  I learned today  that Stalker Patty  is a Harley mama.  Anthony from West Orange,  I learned Larry Zonka  drinks four days.  Bob from Jersey,  I learned that Brittany  is the most clueless  person in the world.  Brittany,  do you know  who Jesus is? 
[02:52:00]  Brittany,  who are the last  three presidents?  I'm not starting  to play your little games.  What little games?  The last three.  If I do that  and then you're  going to ask me  the next one.  Three is easy.  No, no, no.  The last three is easy.  I'm not,  no, I'm not even starting.  Who was the one  before George W?  I'm not going down  that path at all.  Who was right  before the one  we have now?  I'm like an idiot  no matter where.  Do it!  But who was the one  right before  the one we have now?  I'm firm saying no.  I'm not even going to start.  If I start, no.  But who was the one  right before 
[02:52:30]  the one we have now?  Who was the one  that got the BJ's  in the Oval Office?  No.  Who got the BJ's  in the Oval Office?  Not playing.  No.  He's retarded.  No?  Bill Kool.  Bill Kool.  What was that game show,  Joker's Wild,  that used to have  the most retarded questions?  He was our first president  of the United States  and that's not even bad enough.  Then they have to go,  he was George Washington.  George Washington!  You watch Jeopardy  and you're just  flabbergasted 
[02:53:00]  at some of the questions.  I like it.  I'm sorry.  And Joker's Wild  is just, you know.  Your name is  Joseph Smith.  Joseph Smith  is your name.  It was the dumbest.  Like match game.  Yeah.  She was so horny.  She decided to adopt  an entire boy.  That guy Gene  got that really long microphone  like a joint.  A big long microphone.  He's open a big long joint.  Gene Rayford.  And then like,  you know,  ding, ding.  Everyone thinks  of the witty answer.  I said, 
[02:53:30]  army base.  Tell us nothing, Riley.  I said,  a big gang bang.  I saw one where  he was in a cowboy hat.  Look at my scarf  around my neck  like a faggot.  He had a cowboy bandana  around his neck  and a cowboy hat.  Oh, he loved a bandana.  And he kept going,  you know,  hey, I'm a cowboy.  Oh, I'm a cowboy.  I'm a steel horse.  I'm not there.  I'm wanted,  better, alive.  Oh.  Oh, I've seen a million faces  and I've rocked them all.  Oh, and I've sucked them all.  Look at me.  Oh, the ghost and Mrs. Miller.  That ghost was hot.  Oh, the ghost was hot. 
[02:54:00]  Oh.  Hey, uh, Richard.  How's that for a topper?  Richard.  Is this Opie and Anthony?  Do you find  what we just did funny?  Is this Opie and Anthony?  Richard Jennings.  He got us left.  I got chalets.  It's like the dice game now.  All right.  He's cool.  He's in tomorrow.  Rick, book him.  Book him, Dano.  Book him, Dano.  F you.  Book him yourself.  You stiff-haired pineapple  latency sucker.  You ever hear that  out of him in George Vitt? 
[02:54:30]  He's like,  you ever notice  he gave out  all the good assignments  to the white guys?  Like chin-ho.  No, thanks.  Hey, Dano.  Follow that blonde  with the big jugs  and the convertible Mustang  around the island.  Money is no option.  No, no.  What is it?  Money is no object.  Money is no object.  No obstacle.  Hey, uh, Rich.  Chin-ho.  Search every toilet  on the island  for my comb.  F you.  Do it yourself,  you stiff-haired pineapple  eating sea sucker.  It's I don't enjoy. 
[02:55:00]  I'm getting lanced  at other people's material.  I don't enjoy it.  I don't enjoy it.  I don't enjoy it.  You know what's even funnier?  What?  I said, hey, Rich.  I'm going to forget it.  He hung up again.  Oh, there was a phone call  happening during that?  Yeah.  He was on the line  and I go,  hey, Rich.  I go, hey, Rich.  I can't...  He's obsessed.  He's obsessed with this now.  He's like a 15-year-old  in his bedroom  until the operator goes,  you want me to call you back  at 239-4343?  And you're like,  oh my God.  They got us.  Remember that  when the operator  dropped that one on you?  You want me to call you back 
[02:55:30]  at 857-1-121?  Oh, no.  That was the ultimate crime  when you were doing  prank phone calls.  Yeah, your dad would be like...  Prank the operator.  No!  You don't prank the operator.  Yeah, and nothing  with three sixes in it.  That's dead luck.  Don't let the nomad  have three sixes in it.  Oh, that's funny.  I go, hey, Rich.  Hey, Rich, click.  My father used to act like  doing prank calls  and he's going to put me  in prison.  Yeah.  You know how many people  are in the joint for that?  What are you in for?  Oh, I did the Prince Albert  in a can gag.  You know, you better  let him out.  Can't breathe. 
[02:56:00]  Prank, pick him by,  I'll ask.  Hard time.  Rodeo Jones from Westwood?  Hold on.  Richard Jenny's like  going crazy  and I call him  hanging up.  He's playing his hotel room.  I don't need that.  Quick, you son of bitches.  I'll get them.  Where's Richard Jenny  playing now this weekend?  I was making a name  for myself  when you were  banging cheerleaders.  Rodeo Jones from Westwood.  I learned Lola  will be taken  to the Short Hills Mall  this Christmas.  Yeah.  All right.

[02:58:00]  Anthony from West Orange.  I learned even homeless people  make fun of midgets.  Mr. Whipple,  I learned today  opiate syndicated sports  gonorrhea.  Emerson College  graduated some real winners.  And Brittany grew up  in a vacuum.  Vacuum.  A vacuum hole.  We have some tickets  to see...  Richard Jenny.  Richard...
