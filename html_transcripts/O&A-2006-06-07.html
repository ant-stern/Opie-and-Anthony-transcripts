<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and offensive humor, introducing the crew (Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, Rice, E-Rock) with equally insulting nicknames.  Anthony lamented the persistent bad weather, describing his flooded basement apartment and fearing a rat infestation, prompting a humorous exchange with Opie about load-bearing walls.  He then contrasted his meticulous past radio production with Opie's more relaxed approach, sharing a funny story about his ex-wife's mother, Judy, getting drunk and mistakenly entering the wrong condo, stumbling into a college party.  A caller, Pam from Pennsylvania, criticized their humor, leading to a brief, offensively abrupt conversation.

The show then shifted to a discussion about perceived bias in media coverage of hate crimes, followed by a lengthy segment dedicated to David Lee Roth's post-CBS Radio experiences, his awkward bluegrass-infused Van Halen cover on Jay Leno (played on air), and punctuated by further irreverent and offensive comments.  They promoted their upcoming Jim Norton DVD signing and their "Whip Him Out Wednesday" promotion, mentioning Ann Coulter's appearance and a future segment featuring celebrities crying. The broadcast ended with more banter and coffee spilled on a recording device.

A subsequent segment focused on Ann Coulter's 9/11 comments, prompting a heated debate between Opie and Anthony, with Anthony expressing intense anger and misogynistic sentiments, while Opie offered a more nuanced, albeit still offensive, perspective.  The hosts discussed the complexities of free speech versus sensitivity, using highly offensive and misogynistic language.  They also discussed Maria Bartiromo, commenting on her appearance.  This was followed by a comedic segment involving the search for "WOW" stickers at a New Jersey rest stop, further geographic misdirection, and conversations with several callers.  A highly intoxicated caller, Chris, engaged in a rambling and offensive exchange with the hosts. The segment concluded with a "Crying Day" featuring audio clips of various sports figures and celebrities crying (Chad Johnson, Mike Schmidt, Dick Vermeil, Brett Boone, Bruce Kelly), mocked extensively by the hosts, along with updates from a listener, Gina Marie ("ONA Miss Milf"), regarding the "WOW" stickers.

The next segment began with Andrew Dice Clay performing a short, sensitive bit, which was quickly followed by a discussion of Halle Berry's crying in interviews and her Oscar acceptance speech, including comments about her race and family background.  A caller, V. Williams, criticized the show's lack of talent and accused them of racism, prompting sarcastic replies. Penthouse Pet Aria Giovanni was brought into the studio, although a planned wet t-shirt segment didn't happen. The show included audio of a teenager's gynecomastia surgery, discussion of a 70-year-old college graduate, and a heated argument between Opie and producer Jim about communication failures regarding the Penthouse Pet's appearance and the hosts' millionaire jokes, involving accusations of unprofessionalism and threats of violence.  The argument concluded unresolved.

Another segment revolved around the conflict over Aria Giovanni's relatively conservative outfit, with Opie expressing extreme anger and frustration, Ben explaining miscommunication, and the conversation shifting to money and pay disputes.  The discussion involved Aria Giovanni's breasts, earnings, and career.  Anthony and Ben had another heated exchange.  Side conversations included jokes about E-Rock's hair, a listener's comment about Ben and a hat, and numerous vulgar comments. Mark Cuban called in, discussing the NBA Finals, and the conversation returned to wealth. The hosts acknowledged the conflicts and their intention to address communication issues.

The segment with Mark Cuban further elaborated on sports officiating, fan interactions, and Cuban's experiences with wealth and friendship.  The discussion included jokes about HDNet, Cuban's potential naked court-running if his Mavericks won, and beating Steve Nash.  The conversation featured frequent use of the mispronounced word "castorized," and discussions of sexual acts and body parts. A pre-recorded segment on "Eight Ways to Save Gas" was played, interspersed with more off-color jokes. Opie and Anthony's brother Joe called in promoting a U2 understudy audition, and "The Dump Report" featured listener complaints.  An intoxicated caller insulted the hosts.  A significant portion involved ribbing Eric about his hairstyle, culminating in a humorous, crude exchange about a missed dental appointment.  Listener calls, advertisements for show merchandise (including "WOW" stickers), and promotional announcements were interspersed throughout.

The final segment involved one of the hosts singing an altered version of "The Time of My Life," expressing intense joy and romantic love for several minutes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Opie and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rapid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We eat.  Dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Rice.  E-Rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Eric? 
[00:01:00]  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Hats.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Laughing retard.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's.  Just a laughing retard.  It makes me laugh every morning, though.  I've heard that probably a hundred times by now.  Love this, Steve. 
[00:01:30]  Ah, good morning!  Hi.  And welcome to the Opian Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  And we couldn't be happier.  Keep it spreading.  Keep it spreading.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  What's up, Anthony?  Well, I hope.  We broadcast all over the country now.  I hope it's nice where you are.  I'm just ready to, I don't know, jump out a window, slit the wrists. 
[00:02:00]  I'm one of those people that just get, not really depressed, but just angry at nasty weather days on end.  And it's just been.  And you turn on the news on the way in.  And three more days of this.  So you just know, it's like, it's like the movie Seven.  Or 1984.  Or those movies where it's just raining all the time.  It's just gruesome.  The movie Seven's like great.  Oh, the movie Seven, you get like halfway through the movie and go,  has it been raining for like a month in this movie? 
[00:02:30]  I know, you don't even, you don't even realize this first.  This is constantly pouring.  Wait a minute.  It's pouring.  I think it's going to rain the entire movie.  You get the whole movie.  It's raining.  They're in the diner.  It's raining.  They're outside raining.  And that's what it's been like in New York and the Northeast for, I can't even tell you how long.  We're being rooked of a summer.  Because you know, summer starts, you don't know when.  Could start in April.  And then it could be like this and start, I don't know, hasn't started yet. 
[00:03:00]  It's June already.  I'm hoping by July we'll be into summer.  And then September 1st, boom, it's over.  It's cold again.  It just knows.  Like the earth knows.  September 1st, cold, go screw.  So we're going to get like a month and a half of summer.  Yeah, no more lifeguards.  All the leaves fall, same day.  The leaves fall one day.  And you're like pulling your collar up and going, oh, where's my winter clothes? 
[00:03:30]  But yesterday there were lifeguards here and it was 95 degrees.  Lifeguards 95.  Stupid beach umbrellas are out because the sun is so hot.  And then the very next day.  What the?  What?  I'm freezing.  And I only have shorts in my closet.  Someone a long time ago figured all that out for us.  This is the day it changes.  We have calculated for many, many years and we know that this day it officially changes.  Well, why can't the summer start that way? 
[00:04:00]  Thanks for letting me know it's going to rain for the next three days because I officially  have a slum landlord who's decided to blow off my phone calls.  That's it, huh?  I was talking the other day.  That day that my basement where my bedroom is decided that it had to explode.  You scuba dive.  To release water that was stuck in the wall.  The whole.  The top of your stairs.  The whole bottom of the wall like just, you know, just collapsed on itself.  Cave in.  Cave in.  Thank you.  So the water came into my bedroom that's in the basement ruining a ton of crap. 
[00:04:30]  Called the landlord.  What are you going to do about this?  Had our super agent Bob Eatman on the case.  He's not even returning the phone calls of a lawyer, quote, a lawyer slash super agent.  You don't want to do that.  And now it's going to rain for the next three days, so I don't even know if it's going to  start flooding again.  You're flooded.  And I know things are starting to crawl out of the wall.  You know what happens?  You ever see a sinking ship?  You know what crawls out trying to save itself? 
[00:05:00]  Rats.  Right.  The rats.  Lots and lots of rats.  So if your basement starts filling up and behind the walls start getting too wet, you  know where those rats are going to go?  Yeah.  Upstairs.  They're going to be watching your TV.  And the creepy thing is, this is the wall that is right next to the ceiling.  You know what I'm talking about?  Like that side of the bedroom is where I hear the noises.  Is it a load-bearing wall, Hopi?  Load-bearing wall?  What's that?  What's that?  That's one of those walls that kind of hold up the building.  Oh, no, no, no.  Hold up the floor. 
[00:05:30]  No, no, no.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Wow, I decided today it should be the Opie, Anthony, and Eric show.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  I'm a loser.  I actually didn't hear a word you said.  I didn't.  You didn't miss much.  Did I save you or did I ruin a really good line?  You know, I was trying to make it sound like I didn't hear it so he could say it because  it's a very funny line.  Well, the word, he said, it's a load-bearing wall.  Right.  And I said, that's any wall that's next to my bed. 
[00:06:00]  See?  Even through all that work, it's still hysterical.  It still worked.  Worked despite the rigmarole.  Rigmarole.  So it's great.  You know, I worked my whole life to get in the position that we're all in now.  Things are going great.  We're kicking ass on XM.  We're kicking ass in commercial radio.  And I got a slum landlord.  Yeah.  I got a slum landlord.  How did that happen?  With a basement that's falling apart. 
[00:06:30]  That's because you're like a squatter.  You don't leave.  You, like, do you get attached to inanimate objects?  Are you one of those people?  You know, I have been looking.  It's just a hassle to move.  It really is one of the biggest pains in the ass that you go through in life is moving.  Unless, you know, it's your cancer kazoo commercial guy.  Oh, my God.  Where's the audio?  I know.  Enough of him.  But moving is one of the biggest pains in the ass. 
[00:07:00]  And I understand you don't want to move.  But when it gets to the point now where stuff is being destroyed by flooding, it's time to move.  You lived with my mother-in-law.  For six months.  For six months when I moved out after, like, a week.  You couldn't take it after a week.  I said, hey, it's not that bad around here.  Oh, my God.  With Judy.  God rest Judy's soul.  God rest her soul.  Right.  For a banana my Judy.  A banana my Judy.  She's passed on.  But my mother-in-law, me and my ex-wife at the time, wife, lived with her because we moved up to Massachusetts to do radio and decided while we looked for a place, because it was so quick, this happened like, boom, boom. 
[00:07:30]  Hey, you're in radio, Anthony.  Okay.  And she happened to live a mile away from the radio station.  So we all moved in with my mother-in-law.  There's plenty of bedrooms.  Me, my wife, and Greg Opie Hughes.  Yeah.  We actually took... 
[00:08:00]  Were we in the pullout in the living room?  No, you guys had a bed.  We had the mothers.  Right.  Took Judy's bed.  Right.  And Judy slept on the pullout.  Yeah.  And you slept in the basement?  No, I slept in the guest room.  Oh, the guest room, that's right.  I slept in the guest room with the...  She used to rent a room.  No, it was great.  And she wasn't at the time, so you take that.  I had a nice comfortable bed.  You and your ex had a nice comfortable bed in the other room, and she had to sleep on the awful pullout couch.  I'll sleep on the pullout couch with a bar that goes across and hurts your back.  Hell, she was drunk all the time. 
[00:08:30]  She didn't even notice.  She didn't even notice what she was sleeping on.  She was lucky that she found her way home.  Because there was a time that she didn't find her way home.  Yes, yes.  And she ended up in a condo that looked exactly like the one she was...  Well, the condos were all backwards.  Like, you know how condos work.  The left side condo is one setup.  The right side of it is the same setup, only a mirror image of it.  And she came home one night from, I guess, you know, partying a little bit.  A little bit.  And walked up the stairs and passed out on the couch. 
[00:09:00]  And she started getting woken up by, like, 18 and 19-year-olds.  There was a keg in the living room.  And they're like, hey, lady, you got to get out of here.  Imagine, like, you're 18, 19, having a kegger.  And some old lady just comes in and falls asleep on the couch.  She's lucky.  She's thinking that this is her couch and her condo.  Hey, dude, there's a cougar on the couch.  So, yeah, she thought it was like... 
[00:09:30]  What happened?  Everything is backwards.  Everything.  I tried to get to my bedroom, and it was a closet.  And I walk into the living room, and the couch is on the other side of the wall.  I fell asleep.  There's a bunch of teenagers having a kegger in my apartment.  And, yeah, they escorted her back to her own apartment.  But we had to move out immediately because it was always a little bit of just that mother-daughter friction 
[00:10:00]  where, you know, they visit each other and everything's fine.  But once you live together, it gets a little, you know, matter, anti-matter.  Mother-daughter friction, not to be confused with husband and wife friction.  Well, no, there was always that friction.  But thank God I had the lubricant of a radio job to keep that friction down.  I was away long enough.  I used to stay at a station we were at, AAF, and do production where the production guy...  And I was new at the whole radio deal, so everything to me was new, exciting. 
[00:10:30]  I loved it.  I still loved doing radio, but back then it was something like it was completely new.  And the production guy would be like, Anthony, do you think you can maybe make a creative spot out of this head shop  that's located in, you know, some place in Massachusetts?  So I'd go into production and I'd spend three hours.  This is guys...  Like, you guys have been in radio so long, they'd grab the reel, slap it on, and just go, hey, visit this place. 
[00:11:00]  It's great.  You're going to love it.  They got pipes.  They got this.  They got the other thing.  It's located in...  We're all over the place now, but, you know, before you make it to the point Anthony and I have in our careers,  you got to do all this crap after you get off the air, and you got to record these commercials.  Yeah.  Now, when we first started AF, and Anthony's brand new, and I've been in the biz, man, for about ten years at this point,  including college radio, we both got production.  And our stacks were completely even. 
[00:11:30]  We'd have little cubby holes in the production room, and we'd have to go in at night and check our cubbies,  and they were full, like, copy and taped reels, and it was tape.  It wasn't, like, digital.  It was taped, like, donuts of tape that you'd put on that would have, like, a music bed  or the tag that was supposed to go at the end of the commercial, the little voiceover guy with a disclaimer,  and stuff like that, and we'd have to voice the copy.  And Opie had been in it so long, he's, like, you know, a jaded radio guy thinking, and rightly so, 
[00:12:00]  that he should be better than this and be somewhere further already.  I knew how to cut corners is what it comes down to.  Yeah, so he would just read the copy, you know, that's it.  I would, like, there was a...  Yeah, his location in Dorchester, check it out.  One of the famous ones was Sir Morgan's Cove, and they wanted a whole spot with music featuring the band that might be playing,  so I would just go, ah, good enough, I would pick the first track off the CD and talk over the vocals.  Sir Morgan's Cove, this Friday night, it's the Alice in Chains tribute band.  Yeah, you would...  Blah, blah, blah, and the song's blasting in the background with the vocals. 
[00:12:30]  Like, you're supposed to find part of the CD where it's just music and stuff,  or you talk up a part of the commercial and then play, you know, the vocals.  Play the vocals.  And then come back in all night.  You're supposed to mix it.  Mix it and stuff.  I'm like, screw that.  I would just push play on the CD and talk over the whole thing.  Sir Morgan's Cove, located Worcester, Mass., blah, blah, blah.  See you Saturday night.  Yeah.  And what I started noticing, it worked perfectly, was our piles after the show would slowly start changing. 
[00:13:00]  They started calling Opie Slappy, because he could slap together a commercial in less time than the commercial actually takes to run.  It's the 60-second spot.  Opie's done in 56 seconds.  I don't know how he did it.  I was called good enough guy.  Slappy.  I knew to just do it just good enough.  Yeah.  Just good enough where no one's going to say, could you please do this again?  Do it over.  But they weren't impressed.  And Anthony, because his marriage was miserable. 
[00:13:30]  I was miserable to go home.  And he was just getting it to radio.  And I was loving it.  He was producing these things like Steven Spielberg, man.  He was spending hours like, ah, man, I didn't get that just right.  And he would be doing like 10, 15 takes.  He would be searching through the sound effect library for the special sound effect.  I was multi-tracking.  I was multi-tracking for spots.  And then I'd have to go to the bigger board because eight tracks weren't enough.  And then I'd need a high-pitched girl voice.  So I would go to another tape machine, tape my voice, speed it up, and put it on another track for a kid or a girl voice. 
[00:14:00]  It would take like three hours sometimes to do a 60-second spot.  But I won an award for a commercial, remember?  There was one of those headshot things where I did the Cheech and Chong bit.  Great.  And I actually, it was my first year in radio.  And I actually won one of these productions because they give out awards every year.  They have a big thing for the best produced spot. 
[00:14:30]  And I actually won an award.  And I think that ended up in the fire.  I was going to say.  Ex-wife lit and burnt everything I owned.  I was going to say, which homeless guy is walking around with your award?  I won this back in Worcester.  But all of a sudden, all of a sudden our production piles would drastically change.  Mine was getting a lot less than Anthony's pile.  I mean, it was getting close to the ceiling.  It was ridiculous.  And they would keep complimenting him.  And Anthony's like, oh, wow, they like my production.  I'm like, yeah.  It's getting good. 
[00:15:00]  It's kind of weird.  I only got two spots tonight.  But I knew damn well what I was doing.  And then it got down where they would give me one thing.  And all it was was a tag.  A tag.  A tag is basically start Sunday at 8 p.m.  Yeah.  On Fox 25.  On Fox 25.  That's all he had to do.  Roll a tape.  Wait till the end comes and go, on Fox 25.  And then I had the balls because they only had one production room.  We would be done with our afternoon drive show, kicking ass for all of Boston.  And then we had to go in and do our production.  I'm like, all right, can I go first? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, let me go first.  Because I got things to do tonight.  And all of a sudden he goes, yeah, no problem.  And I'm out of there.  I'm not even kidding.  Two minutes later.  Yeah, they gave me a light load today.  And then I would see his box and it would be literally five or six commercials that  he had to fully produce.  Yeah.  Oh, he'd be like, yeah, I got things to do.  Let me just do this.  And I'd get done with my two hours or three hours of production.  And he'd be in the back at the computer perusing pornography in the early days of the  Internet.  And I would call Anthony later on, like, come on, dude, when are we going to eat dinner? 
[00:16:00]  Because we were hanging out a lot back then.  All right, I got one spot to go.  I've got to find a flying saucer shop.  I'll meet you at the restaurant at 930.  It's the worst, man.  930, we got off the air two and a half hours ago.  Oh, I started catching on after a while, though, and go, all right, this isn't as much fun  as it used to be.  I showed you the way, man, because now you're just as bitter as me.  Oh, now forget it.  I love it.  But anyway, so I got a slum landlord, even though we're doing great with our career.  And you lived with the mother-in-law, though, for six months after I left. 
[00:16:30]  It was easy, man.  Yeah, that was kind of one of those weird things.  All I had to do was deal with her, you know, her drunken babble from time to time.  Yeah.  But besides that.  And breaking everything.  Besides that, she was a nice lady.  I got to be honest with you.  She was a nice lady.  But that's like your whole thing.  Like, you find a place.  It's convenient and comfortable for you.  And then you'll just stay there.  Well, here's the deal with the slum landlord.  There's no more rent going to be paid.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:17:00]  There's no more rent going to be paid.  So have fun with that.  And hopefully I'll be out of there sooner than later.  I'm looking at more places this week.  Yeah, you got to get out of there.  There you go.  You got to get up.  Up.  You need altitude in this city.  Street level is filthy.  I gave up on the basement bedroom.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, call me a wimp.  I don't give a crap.  But I'm scared that crap is, you know, walking out of the wall now in the middle of the night.  One of these days, a big rat is going to be on your feet when you wake up. 
[00:17:30]  On my bed, right?  Big rat.  Because the other night I was sleeping, I swear to God, maybe my mind is playing tricks on it, you know, whatever.  All of a sudden I thought there was something in my bed.  I'm like, oh my God, oh my God.  You don't know.  I quickly moved and, you know, like, did this with the covers, whatever.  There was nothing there.  Oh, you don't know.  But all of a sudden, my mind is just running wild with this big hole in the wall, knowing that I've heard noises behind that wall and the ceiling above.  I live like this.  Do you need a new bed?  Did it get wet?  No. 
[00:18:00]  You didn't just have a mattress on the floor?  Oh, no.  I finally got a, yeah, I finally got like a box spring.  And what's with beds and mattresses these days?  Yeah, so, I don't know.  Why are they 10 feet tall?  Let's say hi to him.  Oh, there's a ladder to get into bed.  I need a ladder.  You do, do you?  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, what's going on, boy?  Hey.  Somebody give Opie a kayak so he can push through those walls.  These people. 
[00:18:30]  There's rats behind the walls.  There's just water everywhere.  And Opie is sitting there trying to sleep.  And there's things coming through the walls.  Someone just get him a kayak.  He has his big screen television that is getting wet.  Just, he just wants to touch it.  Let him touch these things before they get wet.  Selene, you moron.  Just stop it.  Opie's sleeping on a door that's floating on his floor. 
[00:19:00]  Lindsay's sleeping on the doorway.  Opie's got to drown.  I know, it got so bad she's bailed for a while.  Is that it?  Yeah, the apartment's a mess.  She bailed.  She's out.  Great.  She's out.  Thank you, slum landlord.  You got to get a good place.  She's bailed.  Oh.  She's back in Philly for a few days until I figure this mess out.  She's like, I will not stay here.  Look, I'm not kidding.  I'm scared of what's crawling out of the walls, right?  I'm a dude. 
[00:19:30]  I'm a guy.  We're supposed to be tougher.  You can't explain that stuff to a girl.  No.  She's like, oh my God.  When are the rats going to start crawling into this place now?  She knows about what you're pulling in.  Yeah.  I'm sleeping.  I'm a multi-millionaire and I live like a loser.  Squalor?  Are you?  You're in squalor.  Are you?  Man, that dump.  It's actually a nice place.  You pays a lot of rent there.  It's like you're paying crap rent, man.  You pay good money there.  Let's go to Pam in Pennsylvania.  I'm pretty penny.  Pam, what's up?  Hi.  Hi. 
[00:20:00]  This is Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hi, Pam.  I just want to let you know that I've listened to 94YSP for many, many years.  Right.  And I, seriously, I know Dave sucked, but I just can't relate to you guys whatsoever.  Like, nothing's funny.  Nothing.  Then stop listening to the show, Pam.  Well, Pam, hold on now.  Let's be fair about this.  I'm trying to give you a show.  What is it?  Pam, hold on.  That's fair enough. 
[00:20:30]  What exactly is it that makes you laugh?  Let's see if we can start at the comment now.  What makes you laugh?  Yeah, what type of humor do you find?  What type of things do you find funny?  I can't name them specifically.  Okay, that's a TV show.  Laughter.  Laughter in the morning is like great medicine for me.  No, laughter is like medicine.  Okay, that's cool.  You're an original thing.  Ew.  What makes you laugh?  Like, what TV shows do you like, Pam?  Laughter is medicine.  No, that's pretty good.  She's original.  I've never heard that before.  It's true.  It makes me feel better when I do that.  It is. 
[00:21:00]  Absolutely.  And I hope when they find a potato-sized tumor on your brain stem that you can chuckle  until it whittles away into nothing.  Laughter is chemo.  Hey, Pam, what TV show do you find funny?  I thought Will and Grace was funny.  All right.  Hilarious.  All right.  That's good.  That show is hysterical.  What else?  It's a hoot.  I mean, Jack.  The guy who plays Jack.  He's fucking funny.  Oh, he's dead funny from age, right?  You can't watch this guy and not laugh.  It's an impossible.  I know.  See, I like that show.  We have a common ground.  What else? 
[00:21:30]  What other show do you find funny?  You ever see The Accused?  That's a really funny...  You ever see that?  It's a great comedy film with Jodie Foster.  Which one?  The Accused.  It's a really funny film with Jodie Foster.  Oh, my God.  That was horrid.  Why?  That's horrid.  You didn't like a pinball machine segment?  She's dancing around, and they're all teaching her a lesson.  It's hilarious.  You know who's funny?  Adam Sandler.  Oh, my...  All right.  You're preaching to the choir, Pam.  Do you like Spanglish?  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, that's another one.  See, Pam, me and you are like right there.  I agree.  I find the same things funny. 
[00:22:00]  Will and Grace and Spanglish.  I laughed.  I cried.  Spanglish was good.  We agree.  And he showed a little more dramatic side, but he was still funny, right?  He accused me of all thinking he was very funny.  All right.  Who set us up?  Because this can't be a real phone call.  Pam, you can't be this stupid.  I swear to God.  It is.  I'm trying to, like, totally...  Laughter is the best medicine.  I'm trying to be in the world, and I just...  I don't know whether...  What about...  Pam, what about stand-up comics?  Do you have any favorite stand-up comedians?  Chris Rock's funny.  Yes, Chris Rock's funny.  Chris Rock is very funny.  That was a good...  I grew up in the day where Bill Cosby was, like, talking to God. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Do you like, like, um...  Do you like Carrot Top?  Oh, no.  He's annoying.  Oh.  Wow.  No.  Because I find him really funny.  Yeah, he's kind of...  And buff.  He's a little disrespectful for my taste.  Yeah.  We're trying to just find some common ground with you, Pam.  And I think, you know, Will and Grace...  Stephen from Bayshore, laughter is medicine.  Someone give Killjoy Pam a chuckle enema.  No, I think...  Yeah, that'd be good.  Pam, listen to me.  I just wanted to let you guys... 
[00:23:00]  Shut the fuck up!  So...  Pam, did you hear me?  And you guys try and have...  Did you hear me, Pam?  Did you hear me?  I said, shut the F up.  This show is not for you.  We don't give a crap that you're giving us a chance.  Go away now and cut your losses.  I kind of liked Pam.  I agreed with her wholeheartedly.  And by the way, she hung up on us.  I didn't hang up on her. 
[00:23:30]  I liked Pam.  She liked Will and Grace.  Will and Grace?  And can you ban stupid Joe from Florida from Instant Feedback?  Please.  Thank you.  Oh, that was being done.  Oh, okay.  Joe Fanning.  Joe Fanning.  Godfather34 at Hotmail.com.  You're a tool, Joe.  Go away. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  We got lots to do today.  We got David Lee Roth on Jay Leno last night.  After the break, we could talk about that for a while.  Jay Leno couldn't even, you know, he started laughing after the performance.  I thought you were going to say he couldn't keep a straight face, but he's kind of born  with that affliction.  He didn't know what to do.  David Lee Roth played a...  Nothing?  Jesus.  I don't know.  Is it funnier?  I know Jimmy won't ever go from Jay.  Well, the Pam thing just drove me nuts because I hate the people.  Well, I'm giving you a chance. 
[00:24:30]  Don't give us a chance.  I don't think she...  The show isn't for you, Pam.  Yeah.  I think she was used to something.  And then we came in and she's not used to us and we don't fit...  That's fine.  But don't call up and say, I'm giving you a chance.  We don't want people to give us a chance.  You either like it or you don't.  What's on in the slot that Will and Grace had, right?  Just because it was the same slot doesn't mean she's going to enjoy it.  I'm sure she loved Will and Grace. 
[00:25:00]  Did you ever sit through one episode of that?  Not one.  Jimmy?  Not one.  I saw moments of it.  Not one.  It was moments, yeah.  I'll say this about Will and Grace.  It's not my style, but they're all good actors.  It was a right.  But it's like, no, it wasn't a right.  There was a lot worse stuff than that.  Every joke had to be a gay joke.  No, it wasn't bad.  It was like...  I know why he's saying this, because he was on Leno the same time the cast of Will and Grace was on.  And he got pictures with the Will and Grace cast and they were all nice to him.  They were.  So he feels like he can't trash the shit. 
[00:25:30]  No, I believe I would trash it.  I just didn't.  Have to be a gay joke.  Was it?  I only saw it.  Couldn't they just be like people that enjoy...  Yeah.  Can't they just be people who want to lose weight and they're too lazy to work out?  By the way, Pam is definitely still listening.  Oh, she'll be listening.  Hello, Pam.  I wouldn't worry you.  Hello.  You can't turn us off.  Wouldn't worry.  All right, so David Lee Roth from Jay Leno when we get back.  Also, Cancer Guy has a brand new commercial to horrify us with. 
[00:26:00]  Watched him swab his throat out long enough, so they figured now it's time to give him a new commercial.  He's going to be a star.  And a racial discussion.  I'd like to have a brief racial discussion.  Oh, of course.  Oh, we can do that.  I'm sure Pam will enjoy that.  And also, Crying Day.  Yes, it's Crying Day.  Actually, it's going to be Crying Week,  because it's going to take three days to get through all these fine clips the boys found  of celebrities and sports stars crying.  I hope we're taping Channel 7 here where they're talking about getting rid of man boobs. 
[00:26:30]  They just showed a black guy.  I swear he had C's.  He had C cups.  And then they showed after.  Oh, my goodness.  We're all over the place.  All right.  Let's take a break, and then we'll be back.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  That's right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to say hi to everyone that's giving us a chance this morning. 
[00:27:00]  Hello.  Hi.  Oh, I got to say hello to a guy, Monster Rain, his name was, on Party Poker.  I got onto Party Poker last night.  I was playing a little losing like a slob.  I stunk up the room.  And the guy didn't believe it was me.  He's like, oh, man.  I go, I'm Monster Rain.  Jimmy Norton fan?  Yeah.  You're going to be there?  He goes, what, are you friends with Jimmy?  You're going to be there Friday for the Tower Records? 
[00:27:30]  I was like, yeah.  I work with him.  Oh, are you an intern or something?  Like, no, I'm Anthony.  He goes, please.  He just writes, please.  And then I look even worse because I'm just losing because I'm all distracted now trying  to prove that I'm me as I'm losing money.  It's just awful.  But, yeah, that was me losing, just stinking up the room.  And speaking of Jim Norton, Jim Norton will be signing copies of his new HBO One Night Stand 
[00:28:00]  DVD.  We're going to be there as well.  Checking it out.  It's this Friday, June 9th, 6 p.m.  Tower Records at Lincoln Center here in New York City.  That's on Broadway and 66th Street, I believe.  We'll be there at 6, hanging out, having a really good time.  I believe we have a few hundred of the DVDs to give away, so make sure you get there on  time.  You will also be able to get a copy of the premiere episode of Lucky Louie, which premieres  this Sunday on HBO.  We're all very excited for Jim Norton.  Big star now.  I wanted to discuss very briefly, if I could, just the racial coverage in the newspapers 
[00:28:30]  here in New York.  It's fair and it's well done.  Well, thank God.  It's always balanced.  Busted in gang attack.  A teenager was beaten, robbed, and called racist slurs in gang-related attacks in Brooklyn.  Four black teens hollered white trash and punched a 16-year-old white boy, who was white,  in the face about 3 p.m.  Then they went through his pocket, stole his cash, and yelled, crips.  That is, that's really basically all it says.  Page 12 of the Daily News. 
[00:29:00]  Page 12?  Yeah.  Page 12.  That's kind of in there, sure.  Here's Long Island Man Faces Hate Crime Rapid Mall Attack.  Ranting that his local mall had become too white, an unemployed Long Island man hurled  a chunk of concrete in a minivan carrying a Caucasian woman.  That's how they were.  And four young children.  This guy, Carl Graves, apparently throws it through the window.  Pretty brave guy, by the way.  Yeah.  He picks a minivan with kids in it.  With a mom and kids.  McCandless and the youngsters, her two children, a nephew and niece, ages 4, 3, 2, and 7 months, 
[00:29:30]  respectively, were shaken but not hurt.  Hey, he took on five people then?  Him and his friend walked away laughing, and several witnesses followed him.  That's page 19 of the Daily News.  He didn't like the fact that the Sunrise Mall on Long Island, he had discussed this with  his buddies beforehand, was getting too white and too upscale.  So he grabs a big piece of cement and wails it through a minivan windshield with a woman  driving in it with her, you know, with young children in the car. 
[00:30:00]  Can you imagine?  Look at the way they treated the fat next door.  He was front page on every one of these stupid New York guilt-ridden rags.  Front page.  If a white guy had thrown a brick through a black woman's minivan window, because there  was too many blacks moving into the neighborhood, there would be protests and marches.  Front page for days.  Business as usual, because when the media looks at it, that's just the way you people act.  That's the way they view you.  Right.  That's how the media sees it.  Yep.  They're the most racist at everybody.  You act that way because it's in your nature, so why make it look like it's news? 
[00:30:30]  Why not just report that a cow ate some grass?  Right.  It's bound to happen.  Really?  Fat Nick was on the cover of every paper for days on end because he beat up a black guy  with a baseball bat.  A black criminal!  Who was in the neighborhood to steal cars.  Now, this woman was in the shopping center to shop with young children in the vehicle,  and he just plain, because there's too many white people at his mall, which probably is 
[00:31:00]  a good thing that it's turning around a crime-ridden place that's turning around too many white  people, and he figures he's going to throw it through the windshield.  Where's the news coverage of it?  Where's the big heavy-duty news coverage?  Where's the reporters with their outrage?  Where are they?  I don't see it.  There's no outrage.  There's a man-breast story on the news this morning.  Yeah, that's getting heavier rotation.  Are you trying to say there's a double standard?  No.  I'm saying this is not even a part...  I wouldn't mind if it was a double standard, but this is not... 
[00:31:30]  You can't say this is a double standard.  I didn't even notice that was going on until you brought it to my attention to me, and  now I notice that all the time as well.  It is revolting.  Yeah.  Revolting.  Revolting.  They're just so afraid.  That was an equal coverage on race hate crimes.  Of course!  How about it?  But blacks are just expected to act that way, and whites, we should know better.  Is that the way it is, Daily News?  That's the way the Daily News sees it.  That's the way the Post sees it.  Ugh.  That's the way the mass media sees it.  Yep.  They coddle, they coddle, and say, well, this is, you know, well, we know how they are. 
[00:32:00]  Yep.  So we'll just, you know, hide it in the paper.  Hey, if there's black people that got views on it, please, I'd love to hear, I'd love to  hear if anybody can justify the media coverage of that.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I'd love...  Try.  You can.  I'd love to hear.  Give it a try, because, eh.  Well, you can give us a call.  1-866-313-FREE.  She's Caucasian.  Moving on to other things, because we have so much to do today.  We got the latest Throat Cancer Voice Box Guy commercial.  This guy's been disgusting me for weeks now. 
[00:32:30]  I cannot get away from...  Every time I turn on TV, there he is.  They just had it behind you, Anthony, as we were discussing what Jimmy wanted to discuss  there.  Now, look.  I'm starting...  See how I bend my neck?  See what I do?  I bend my neck down, and I can't talk, because every time the commercial comes on, it grosses  me out more and more each time.  I used to be able to watch him swab, cotton swab, Q-tip his blowhole in his throat.  Now, I can't look at that.  So, I now have to turn away from the TV...  And go, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[00:33:00]  And not look.  I don't see that.  At him, because it looks like it hurts and stings.  It looks like it stings.  It's an open wound in your neck.  And it just looks like it stings.  I would love to put him on a motorcycle and have him drive upstate and see how many bugs  he gets in his windpipe.  That Venus flytrap throat.  I wonder if Pam's finding this funny.  You gotta put a...  Die!  You gotta put a screen in it, like an apple, and you hollow it out to make a bong out of 
[00:33:30]  it.  Just burn pot under his neck.  It's convenient.  A bowl.  You could just, yeah, lay on your back.  Put the little bowl in there.  Light it.  Just kind of do what you do to inhale.  I don't know what it takes.  What, do you gotta hold your nose?  Yeah.  I think you gotta push your belly button.  Yeah, yeah.  You can just push his gut.  Anyway, we got the latest commercial, and it's even more horrific.  I guess this is gonna be a trilogy or something.  I don't know.  They're just gonna get into the life of this guy.  He's gonna get his own TV show, I bet.  Now he talks about how he used to swim, and he can't go in the pool anymore. 
[00:34:00]  But it's his Spanish accent, and everyone's kind of laughing at how his little talk box,  his little, you know, ah, why not that cancer, because how it picks up his Spanish accent.  You would think, you know, did he have to buy one that says Spanish on it?  I think the next commercial, they're gonna have him in a hurricane, just so you  could hear it whistling through.  Oh, whoo, whoo.  You gotta have a jug band guy play his blowhole.  Oot, oot, oot, oot, oot, oot.  So here's the latest throat cancer, cancer kazoo commercial. 
[00:34:30]  I was born on an island where swimming was a waste of life.  I never thought that anything could hit me from the water.  Then I go through cancer from a smoking cigarette and lost my voice.  Now I have to drink to a hole in my throat.  If water gets inside it, it will drown me.  I used to love swimming.  I used to love swimming. 
[00:35:00]  I used to love swimming.  Well, he's not swimming anymore.  He used to love swimming.  And they have him walking around the pool while everyone else is enjoying a day at the pool.  Yeah, they're all swimming, and he's walking around, and he's just kind of looking in.  If he was born on an island where swimming is, I guess that would be Cuba.  Yes.  I say 90 miles, did you?  He got over here with his family on his back.  He just kind of breathed out real hard, and it was like a jet ski. 
[00:35:30]  He can't go swimming anymore, and he says it at the end.  If he gets water down there, hilt around.  See him lurking by the kiddie pool in a pair of tight little white bikini slacks.  Scaring the children as he's knee-deep in the water.  Stupid blowhole.  He dares not go any further, unless a drop gets into his blowhole.  Don't smoke, but have some candy.  They should make him a carnival game.  You know the water guns?  The water gun where you're going to blow his head up like a balloon? 
[00:36:00]  Right.  Oh, God.  Do it until his tongue pops out or something.  Please stop.  I'm drowning.  Oh, enough of him.  What next?  I always wanted to be an astronaut, but the helmet doesn't fit on my head.  They're just going to have him come up with new things every time.  New things he can't do.  It starts slow, because it just started with him in the bathroom.  Who knew he liked swimming?  We're learning more about him to watch him drop dead.  And I said in the back office, he looks even creepier under sunlight. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  In his bathroom with the lighter lighting or whatever, he didn't look as bad.  Yeah.  Bright sunlight.  Ooh.  They ought to do some commercial on that comb-over he's got, too.  I used to have a full head of hair.  All right.  Poor old bastard.  Hey, we got a little mention in the daily news today.  Oh, yeah.  It's Roth Talk.  People are sick of Roth Talk, but it's a hot topic right now. 
[00:37:00]  We like talking about hot topics.  Roth.  What did he do now?  Roth Talk.  Not for the first time, David Lee Roth told Neil Cavuto on Fox News Monday that he thinks  CBS Radio saw him only as a bridge move until they could sign Opie and Anthony to take the  old Howard Stern slot.  By the way, we contacted Neil Cavuto to come on our show, and like a big pussy he is, he  declined.  Of course, because a guy like that, well, he wants to always get you on his turf.  He took his turf. 
[00:37:30]  Why would he?  Him, Bill O'Reilly, people like that are always like their own turf, their own situation.  Their own...  So they could spin it.  Their own shower with a loofah sponge.  Oof.  Wait, that was settled.  He paid big money to settle that so no one could accuse him of anything, sir.  Bill O'Reilly.  Stop it.  He's a goose.  Let's see.  Yesterday on their free FM show, Opie and Anthony replied, you got fired because you sucked,  said Anthony.  Nobody listened.  He said that?  I thought we were a little more intelligent than that, but that's what they decided to 
[00:38:00]  print.  I guess that slipped out.  Opie and Anthony asked why if CBS saw Roth only as an interim, it would have given him  a multi-million dollar contract.  I said that?  Leslie Gold, Free FM Afternoon host, said the same thing Monday in her own comments on  the Cavuto interview.  Gold said Roth wasn't given much time to establish himself as a radio personality, but she noted  that his ratings were awful and said the word was that he wouldn't listen to radio professionals.  Roth has said his whole point was not to do traditional radio. 
[00:38:30]  I think they, CBS, are a little bit toward trying to repeat the past, he told Cavuto.  I want to try and take something into the future, man.  What awful, trite dialogue that is.  Radio you don't want to listen to.  That's every politician.  We got to look for the future.  The future.  I think we had something really exciting.  Roth said he's fighting CBS over his payout and he's had.  Where'd you hide it?  And he's had offers from both satellite radio companies and in between, whatever that means.  In between the two satellite radio companies? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, more Roth babble.  That means on the space station, they want to fly him up and he can broadcast to the three  cosmonauts.  David Lee Roth, very funny.  They find him hysterical.  You want to hear David Lee Roth taking it into the future?  Yeah, let's hear the future.  He was on Jay Leno last night.  And he's got this horrible CD out where he takes all the classic Van Halen songs that  we all grew up listening to.  And destroys them.  And now it's done to fiddles and banjos and what have you. 
[00:39:30]  That is something.  It's the southern side of Van Halen.  That's something a goof guy would do.  Like a goof band or something.  Like Richard Cheese does the lounge act versions of Disturbed songs and stuff like that.  That's what somebody would do.  Hey, they smoke a little pot and you're sitting around with your friends and you go, dude,  let's take Van Halen songs but put them to like bluegrass instruments.  Dude, that is so funny. 
[00:40:00]  And then you do it as a goof.  That's great.  Pass the bar.  Yeah, dude.  Pass the bar.  It's not something the guy that was singing these songs and was a rock hero back in the  80s does.  But he's doing it.  That's the exciting new David Lee Roth project.  So he walked out on stage because he had to have his big entrance.  Yeah.  So the guy started fiddling and playing the banjo and then David Lee Roth walks out off  awkwardly with that ridiculous smile of his, that creepy smile. 
[00:40:30]  Remember like when Eddie used to start a song like Running With The Devil or something?  And like he'd intro and David Lee Roth, you couldn't find him.  And then the music would kick in.  The lights would just boom, lasers on the stage.  And David Lee Roth would come flying off of one of the PA stacks in a scissor kick, hit  the stage, bring himself back up and start singing a kick-ass song.  And now he's, and he just comes walking out with a dopey smile on his face, not knowing 
[00:41:00]  what to do with himself.  What happened?  Hey man, you and I are all about, you know, bringing things into the future.  But if it means something like this, I want to stay exactly where we are today.  Oh, please.  Please welcome David Lee Roth.  He's laughing even there.  Please welcome.  Like my brother said this morning, when did he become clueless?  He has no idea.  No.  How ridiculous he looks. 
[00:41:30]  I'm sure Eddie Van Halen's really happy that, uh, what was he wearing?  Coveralls.  Very safe clothes.  A collared shirt and like, uh, jeans.  I get up!  Oh, please don't.  Do you think Eddie watched this?  Just all the Van Halen brothers and Michael Anthony just made a night of it. 
[00:42:00]  Just watching and laughing at him.  And then he starts awkwardly looking at the crowd with that smile.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I need the words that you've seen.  Can't you see what I'm made?  I've got someone helping him sing it. 
[00:42:30]  Might as well jump!  Yeah.  Woo!  Woo!  Might as well jump!  Come on, baby, jump!  What?  Might as well jump!  Were there hay bales around him?  Ow!  Hey, you!  Who said that?  Baby, how you been?  Who's gonna buy this CD?  No one.  Radio people to play and goof on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got it.  Hey, can't you see me standing here? 
[00:43:00]  I got my back against the ragged.  Promenade!  Swing your partner.  Dosey-dose.  Time to grow some strange fruit.  Woo!  Might as well jump!  Get down!  Come on, baby, jump!  Yeah!  Oh.  Might as well jump!  Come on, baby, jump!  Get him out!  Jump on the fiddle one time. 
[00:43:30]  Jump on the fiddle one time.  Yeah.  Here's the solo.  Oh, my God.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  And David jumped upon a hiccup or something.  Let me show you how it's done.  I just picture Eddie shooting his television set like Elvis. 
[00:44:00]  We should stop this, but we won't.  Absolutely not.  So you could suffer, too.  And they're like, all right, it's finally over.  No, remember, this is where the keyboards come back in.  What did his band look like?  Not too good.  Did they look like backwards kind of guys or were they ordinary like rock guys? 
[00:44:30]  Did they have big beards?  They may have had a full set of teeth between them.  Yeah.  Looked like ZZ Top.  I loved Van Halen growing up.  Yeah.  Let me make that perfectly clear.  I absolutely loved Van Halen growing up.  Did I say I was never a huge Van Halen fan? 
[00:45:00]  So this just pleases me beyond every hour.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't hate them, but this is just great.  Oh, that annoying little riff on that ukulele thing is just pissing me off.  I put this on college when they did in the 70s.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  There you go, it is.  Isn't that amazing?  Please jump.  Please jump off of something very tall, Dave.  And this is more of a visual, but then Leno comes out because it's the end of the show 
[00:45:30]  to thank David Lee Roth and the band for playing this.  Yeah.  Listen very closely.  Like, Leno is, he is a professional, but he couldn't even help himself.  You hear him, like, chuckle.  He gives a little chuckle.  Like, what the hell did we just see?  Listen.  Thank you, David.  Good job, guys.  Thank you so much.  I want to thank my guest, Tim Russett, wisdom of a podcast.  My guest, this ass, what a jackass.  I want to thank this blithering idiot.  It's subtle, but, I mean, you can see it on the video, like, oh, my God. 
[00:46:00]  It's the laugh talk.  I want to thank this phone has started to know I can believe, blithering my phone.  Oh, that was good.  I'm going to...  I like the chorus, though.  No, you don't.  Shut up.  Can't you see me standing here?  I like that.  Can't you see what I meant? 
[00:46:30]  What?  When did the word change?  Well, that was good.  Oh, that was beautiful.  I enjoyed that.  There's a whole album full of that, by the way.  Yeah, right.  I'm not afraid to promote it.  Yeah, here it is.  There's 18 songs.  Yeah.  I think, well, we've played Jump, I think I should set this aside so we can play other  tracks.  Why don't you store it somewhere safe?  Whenever the calls are bad, I think that should be the listener's punishment.  Yeah.  I like it.  I'm just going to...  Yeah, put it somewhere safe. 
[00:47:00]  That'll do.  Keep it there.  At least we know where it is.  Someone get a napkin?  Uh-oh.  At least we know where it is.  All over.  Oh, boy.  It took out my coffee, too.  He spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry.  Didn't get any electronic equipment, did it?  Nah, why would it in the middle of all that?  Nah, it's fine.  Nah, everything sound...  Everything sound good?  Wait, check one, two.  I'm sorry, guys.  I don't know my own strength sometimes. 
[00:47:30]  Wow, there's coffee everywhere.  You don't know your own strength?  It was a CD.  No, actually, the thing shattered...  It wasn't like you broke weights.  No, dude, the thing shattered like JFK's head, and then pieces went that way and took out  the coffee cup.  You see that CD come apart, man?  I'll have to talk to Kevin tonight if I see him.  That's how Leno laughs at you.  It was the magic CD, man.  That's how the host laughs.  Do it for Eddie.  Big dumb face.  It's due the whole album, man. 
[00:48:00]  Someone was wishing that you would have done your bit during that song.  Might as well jump.  Should we?  Should we?  Would you?  Would you?  No, you might as well.  Good point.  Well, we can't just see what I man.  Well, we're going to need another copy so you can do that, Jimmy.  We'll see if we can...  That thing came apart nice and then went sideways and took out my coffee.  There's coffee all over the screen still.  Oh, it shattered like a pack of bag of a doze. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, it is.  We'll explain that to the new listeners in just a bit here.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Hopefully, you're getting your WOW stickers.  If you're not, make the homemade WOW signs.  Write it on the back of your dirty trucks and dirty cars.  Basically, WOW means Whip Him Out Wednesday. 
[00:49:00]  There are ladies out there that will flash you as you're driving around, man.  Simple as that.  Just get the WOW in your car and just sit back and drive.  And one day, you're going to get flashed and you're going to go,  Oh, my God, this really does work.  Yeah, you don't have to do anything else.  You just put it on your car and ignore it.  And don't harass the ladies.  There are plenty of ladies out there that will WOW you, okay?  And we're doing WOW sticker stops all over the joint.  Here in New York, we're doing a WOW sticker stop at a rest stop on the New Jersey Parkway. 
[00:49:30]  Wow.  Is this true?  Yeah, it's hosted by ex-Governor McGreevy.  ONA Free FM hit at Raritan Valley Rest Stop on the New Jersey Parkway.  Where the hell is that?  I don't know.  Just stop in and cover a glory hole with a WOW sticker.  Put your mouth by a glory hole and a WOW sticker comes through.  Only the best for us, man.  You can get your WOW stickers at a rest stop on the New Jersey Parkway today from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. 
[00:50:00]  I understand there's a rape in Howard Beach where they'll be handing them out.  All you have to do is go in one of the stalls and go,  And you'll get a sticker thrown over the top.  In a buddy booth.  When the little curtain lifts up, you wave at your new buddy and he hands you a WOW sticker.  Raritan Valley Rest Stop.  All right.  They're also giving out WOW stickers today in West Palm Beach.  9 a.m. this morning for an hour.  Southeast corner of Military Trail and Okeechobee Boulevard.  Oh, my God.  We got to sound like we know what we're talking about. 
[00:50:30]  You got to sound local, Opie.  If you don't sound local.  What is it?  Okeechobee.  Okeechobee.  Of course it's Okeechobee.  That's a lake.  I was just on Okeechobee Boulevard recently.  They're also going to be at Juno Beach noon to 1 at the pier and 5 to 6 at Sofa King Sports Bar.  Very motivated at West Palm Beach to get the WOW stickers out.  I like that.  I'm getting a lot of feedback from West Palm.  A lot of them on my MySpace.  The home of E-Rock's family.  It's all E-Rock's family.  Yeah.  They're emailing saying, 
[00:51:00]  Please keep him there.  We don't ever want to see him.  He's an embarrassment.  And also a WOW sticker stop in Philly today starting in about 20 minutes, 730.  At the Mall Boulevard entrance of the King of Prussia Mall.  Alright, so there you go.  There's some places to get your WOW stickers today.  What 70s rock star does Ann Coulter look like?  What is bugging me?  Her face.  She looks like some guy from the 70s.  I don't know.  What tranny was David Bowie?  I can't.  If you spiked her hair up, cut all that hair off, spiked it, put some glitter on her face, 
[00:51:30]  David Bowie.  Okay.  A little David Bowie action.  She looks like a tranny, Ann Coulter.  No wonder I like her.  Also, brand new brown vintage WOW shirts.  Ooh.  The first brand new WOW design in many, many years.  You can get the brand new WOW shirts at myradiostore.com.  Enough plugging.  We got to do radio.  Yes.  Alright, we got the teen man boob surgery story we were just talking about.  We could talk about Ann Coulter.  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do? 
[00:52:00]  Which way do you want to go here?  A little Ann.  Want to do Ann?  Ann's quick.  She, I guess, is putting her big manly tranny foot in her mouth.  Jimmy finds her hot.  Yeah, well.  Or sexy, you said, right?  Well, here's why I like her.  Just because she smashes liberals so hard, and every time she speaks on a college campus,  because they're a bastion of freedom of speech, they protest her being there.  Yeah.  Because they're a bunch of pukey babies.  However, I think on the 9-11 thing, she's coming off like a snot, and someone should spit  on her for it.  You know why she looks attractive? 
[00:52:30]  In contrast to the other talking heads that are women.  If you watch the Sunday news shows, the talking head shows, wow.  Yee, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  So she's like uber babe to them.  Yeah, it's like that broad that does the finances.  What's her name?  They call her the stock, the money honey, the money honey. 
[00:53:00]  What's her name?  Is that Susie Orman?  No, it's not, you imbecile.  It certainly isn't.  I wish I could remember her name.  But she's like hot because everyone around or all the other women that are in that line  of work are pigs.  Al Dukes hit it, by the way, and looks like Edgar Winter.  There you go.  That's exactly what she looks like.  Edgar Winter with a slight tan, which is almost impossible for Edgar.  Hey, by the way, everyone's killing me here.  Where's the New Jersey Parkway?  I don't know.  I just read it. 
[00:53:30]  I'll be honest with you.  The New Jersey Parkway.  Well, obviously, it's the Garden State Parkway.  It's the Parkway in New Jersey.  It's the Raritan Valley rest stop on the New Jersey Garden State Parkway.  Is it the New Jersey Turnpike or the Garden State Parkway?  Because New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway, they put the two together and they're calling  it the New Jersey Parkway.  Who wrote that?  It's right off 287.  If you go 287 towards Morristown.  Good luck finding your wow stickers today.  Just drive through all the rest stops until you find them. 
[00:54:00]  Look for truckers having gay sex.  How about this?  You go into a rest area.  You're either going to walk out with a wow sticker or some tapioca pudding on your shoes.  I don't know.  All right.  Either the back of a wow sticker or something on you will be sticky.  Please.  Don't worry about it.  Wow.  What is that?  Why I ought to wipe it off Wednesday.  Well, the front page of the New York Papers, the New York Post has the amazing catch in 
[00:54:30]  the Yankee game last night.  Ooh, a little robbery for the Red Sox.  I wonder if we have a call on that.  Yeah, we do have the call on that.  And then we got the Daily News.  Coulter, the cruel, new book accuses victims' wives of exploiting their grief.  Right-wing author is brutal.  Today's show tirade on 9-11 widows.  Maria Bartiromo.  That's her name, the money honey.  Oh, with the frog eyes, the glasses.  Frog eyes, good.  With the glasses, right?  Does she wear glasses?  I don't know.  She's the one with the glasses.  I just know they call her the money honey. 
[00:55:00]  She's a girl who deals with money.  Yeah.  I get it.  She's aight.  That's what Jimmy invites over every night, money honeys.  A money honey.  After everything's done, they go, money honey, and leave.  Leave him just as lonely as he was when they got there.  Struck down in terrified loneliness.  Alone again.  Tee hee.  Now someone's saying the sticker stop is on 287.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's by Morristown, which is also where the Raritan family turnpike parkway thing is. 
[00:55:30]  Forget it.  Just make a left.  There's some toll booth involved.  Exactly.  Why would the info be right?  Why would it be?  Why would it be?  It's actually, you have to stop, and it's not in the one Sonny Corleone was murdered in.  It's the one right next door to that.  By the way, Eric Logan killed me yesterday.  I was talking to him after the show, and we were talking about 666, right?  Yeah.  And he goes, I noticed you guys didn't really do much with the 666 thing.  Everyone was talking about 666.  And he goes, ah, no big deal. 
[00:56:00]  I guess you guys could do it next time when it happens a thousand years from now.  Oh, yeah.  He just found it strange that a show like ours wouldn't do something a little, you know, our little spin on the whole 666 thing.  The day before, I said it the day before, we should be idiots and complete fags and walk over with little, like, devil horns on.  It's like complete dopes.  Just hacks.  Absolutely.  He was great and so sarcastic.  Ah, no big deal.  You could do it next time when it happens a thousand years from now.  A thousand years. 
[00:56:30]  We should have done something.  How about this?  How about this?  We'll do 613.  We'll do it Monday.  Let's go to Randy.  Randy, real fast.  Hey, um, the Garden State Parkway by the Raritan Bay toll.  It's off 120 in Middlesex County.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Okay, the other thing is, if you want to see a hot save, look at Bambi Francisco on CBS Market Watch.  She is hotter than all of them.  All right, we'll check her out.  Thank you, sir.  Bambi Francisco.  I think Bambi is on the news.  He just explained where the wow sticker stop is. 
[00:57:00]  I still don't know.  I have no idea.  I know exactly where it is.  When you're going south of the parkway, I actually do know.  Are you kidding?  No, there's a big Raritan bridge, and there's a rest area that you can get to from northbound  lanes or southbound lanes.  It's in the middle of the highway.  It's right by, like, exit 120.  It's a hell of a place to have a wow sticker stop.  It's actually a pretty, it's a very well-traveled area, because it's one of those rest areas  that's in the middle.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we get into the Ann Coulter thing?  You know.  I do.  Here's the tirade from the Today Show.  Sorry to interrupt you.  That's where the guy said to me, that's quite a pretty one. 
[00:57:30]  It was in the Raritan.  Wow.  In, like, 1991, when I was coming home from Rascals.  Oh, so there's a little fond memory for you there.  Well, I'll say there is.  A little Jim Norton history there.  A nice compliment.  Yes.  Might be able to find some of Jim Norton's DNA at that rest area.  I'm going to do a day of bus trip to where the Monster Rain took place.  Ah.  And take some pictures.  I already took pictures.  I have them.  Very good.  Okay.  Ann Coulter on the Today Show.  This is the tirade everyone's talking about today.  Ann Coulter separated at birth from Iggy Pop.  Also, people are saying there's a little Iggy Pop going on there. 
[00:58:00]  Sure.  All right.  Here we go.  These broads are millionaires, lionized on TV and in articles about them, reveling in  their status as celebrities and stalked by grieferazis.  I've never seen people enjoying their husband's death so much.  Yes.  Because they dare to speak out?  To speak out using the fact that they're widows.  This is the left's doctrine of infallibility.  If they have a point to make about the 9-11 commission, about how to fight the war on terrorism,  how about sending in somebody we're allowed to respond to? 
[00:58:30]  No, no, no.  We always have to respond to someone who just had a family member die.  But I think the people in the middle of the story...  Oh, you're questioning their authenticity.  No, the story is...  So grieve, but grieve quietly.  No, the story is an attack on the nation.  And by the way...  That requires a foreign policy response.  And by the way...  That does not entail...  They also criticized the Clinton administration for their failures leading up to 9-11.  Not the ones I'm talking about.  No, they have.  No, no, no, no.  They have.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But is your message to them just...  No, no, no.  They were cutting commercials for Carrie.  They were using their grief in order to make a political point while preventing anyone 
[00:59:00]  from responding.  Wow.  She's really coming off just like...  You want to grab her by that awful neck and just spit in her face.  That thin little pencil neck.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  They're using their grief.  I wouldn't say they're enjoying their husband's deaths.  I mean, come on.  Don't be such a dumb hole.  Here's the facts of life, people.  Here's the facts of life.  A lot of people died on September 11th. 
[00:59:30]  Trade Center, Pentagon.  Not all of them were angels.  And not every married couple that were there was...  Happy.  Was happy, yeah.  I'm sure there were some people that went...  You know?  This would have cost me a lot of money because I was being divorced tomorrow.  But the majority of the people, it's authentic grief, and they shouldn't be judged by the  likes of her.  And as far as like...  It's one person, one vote. 
[01:00:00]  But you know what?  I have a little bit more leeway for their opinion.  I don't know.  Because when you're married to someone and they have to jump out of the 91st floor, I have  a little bit more...  I put a little more credence to what they're saying than some snotty, mop-haired, you know,  witch.  Which is really what she's coming off like.  And I actually agree with most of what she says.  But this one, I just listened to her talk.  You want to spit in her face.  Yeah.  Well, I think some people will be spitting in her face.  Absolutely.  She's going to have a rough time walking around in the next few weeks.  She should.  Well, Matt asked a pretty good question yesterday. 
[01:00:30]  No, he didn't.  Don't they have right to opinion?  Let's listen to this.  If you lose a husband, you no longer have the right to have a political point of view?  No, but don't use the fact that you lost a husband as the basis for your being able  to talk about it while preventing people from responding.  Let Matt Lauer make the point.  Let Bill Clinton make the point.  Don't put up someone I'm not allowed to respond to without questioning the authenticity  of your belief.  Well, but apparently you are allowed to respond to them.  Well, yeah, I did.  Right.  But that is the point of liberal infallibility, of putting up Cindy Sheen, of putting 
[01:01:00]  out these widows, of putting out Joe Wilson.  No, no, no.  You can't respond.  It's their doctrine of infallibility.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  These are the doctrine of infallibility.  Shut up.  These are actually people.  Cindy Sheen, I don't like.  But the bottom line is she has some.  I have more respect for what she said.  Why?  Because his son was killed in Iraq.  I don't I don't care.  And these are people that are genuinely have lost somebody.  So to me, their opinion is a little more valid than an outsider. 
[01:01:30]  It's like a guy in the football game.  I trust his opinion a little bit more than somebody who's been sitting on the bench watching.  But I'm understanding her point.  I do, too.  I understand her point.  Don't tell me the conservatives don't do it.  Her point is that you can't then criticize that person on their opinion.  When you drag out someone whose loved one has been killed and they are preaching, let's  say, anti-Bush, you can't then call them out on it because they're pretty much untouchable,  is what she's saying, because of their grief.  But I disagree with her. 
[01:02:00]  They do call out the opinions.  Why would you why would you call it the person?  What are you what are you going to say to a 9-11 widow?  That how are you what are you going to say to her?  You can disagree with their opinion.  I like Bush.  But since their opinion includes the death of a loved one, you then can't go in and critique  their opinion without it looking like you're picking on someone that lived through this  horrible point in their life.  So now you're you're kind of screwed.  Yeah, it's kind of an untouchable opinion.  I've never seen she does have a point here. 
[01:02:30]  I don't think she does.  And that only point counterpoint with Jim Norton and Anthony.  I like it.  I've just never seen anybody say, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You can't disagree with a 9-11 video.  I'm sorry.  9-11 a widow.  You can't disagree.  No one says that.  But when you do disagree, you look like a bad guy.  But I've never seen the example of that.  I'm the bad guy.  Look at me.  I'm the bad guy.  Say goodnight to the skinny whore with the blonde hair who look like a tranny.  You know, I can't even have a kid with her.  She's too skinny, Manny. 
[01:03:00]  Let's get back to the audio.  Have somebody else make the argument.  I'm saying is I don't think they've ever told you you can't respond.  Right.  So why can't they make the argument?  You're getting testy with me.  No, no.  I think it's a dramatic statement.  These broads, you know, are millionaires.  Yeah, you think I shouldn't be able to respond to them.  I've never seen people enjoying their husband's death so much.  Yes, they're all over the news.  The book is called Godless, the Church of Liberalism, Ann Coulter. 
[01:03:30]  You disingenuous bitch.  Did she leave her something?  She did.  7-17.  Oh, come on, Matt.  You just thought it was getting good.  You disingenuous bitch.  Here's what she is doing.  The same way she's saying people can't respond, she's making purposefully inflammatory statements.  And then when the people are going, what are you saying?  She's going, whoa, I'm just responding.  You see, you can't respond.  She's purposefully saying things she knows are going to annoy people and putting herself  in a position to be criticized.  Right.  By over, by saying these broads are enjoying their celebrity.  I've never seen anybody enjoying their husband's death so much. 
[01:04:00]  So you say, what are you talking about?  Whoa, I can't criticize them.  No, stupid.  If she had come out and said, look, I disagree with their opinion because I think Bush is doing  a good job and I don't think Kerry is the guy or whatever, blah, blah, blah.  And then she was criticized.  She'd have a point.  But by saying purposely inflammatory things like that, she's a phony.  Yeah, I think she did it on purpose.  Of course she did.  Overkill to really drive her point home.  Yeah.  So it's not making it look like people are responding harshly to just an honest gal giving  an opinion.  She does kind of have a valid point, but she's going about it wrong. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  The point, I'm not saying that in this country, we don't give grief sufferers a bit more credence  or whatever, but I'm sure they do it on the right as well.  Both sides.  Don't tell me you don't do it with abortion.  Both sides.  Oh, yeah.  All they do is drag around photos of fetuses.  Huh?  What would his name have been?  Huh?  Please.  Old mushy.  Exactly.  But everybody uses grief.  Come on.  Stop.  That's not just a liberal issue.  Stop.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  It's the ONA virus.  I'll kiss you on the mouth. 
[01:05:00]  Spreading across America.  We got to start crying day.  Yeah.  We've been talking about crying day.  It is crying day today.  And we'll play some of the crying clips next.  Please.  Ah, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  And just in case you think this thing doesn't work, on the instant feedback, Gina Marie.  From a website we still can't mention.  Where are we at with that?  We have a lot of great websites.  We love fan interaction.  Huh? 
[01:05:30]  Huh?  We're working on it?  Close.  Oh, close.  Okay.  In the meantime, just join our MySpace account, Opie and Anthony.  And all the websites are up there for your viewing pleasure.  Or Google.  Or Google our names.  Absolutely.  Gina Marie.  Hey, guys.  I'm in Massapequa area.  And if any of your fans are around the area, I will be wowing them all day today.  So tell them to be on the lookout.  On the lookout for what?  I don't know.  It's going to be a chick in some kind of car.  She didn't give us any more info. 
[01:06:00]  But she's out there.  And her name is ONA Miss Milf.  And just curious, just before we wrap this up, Evan Calder's complaining about Bush having  an Iraqi woman with ink on her finger at a State of the Union address.  I mean, she's pretty much an uncriticizable person.  And how about John Walsh?  Another example of a guy who's very, very opinionated.  Obviously, we listen to him because he's not a crime fighter.  He's a guy who lost his son hard.  He got his job through the death of his son. 
[01:06:30]  And he's right about almost everything he says.  But he's kind of above reproach when it comes to it.  I know he's not trying to push national policy.  But in some things, he is.  You don't hear people criticizing him.  Well, who cares if he lost his son?  When he yells at those bad guys, oh, my God.  That's great.  But the thing is, if you were one of those bad guys, wouldn't you just go right for the jugular with him?  Which you could.  You could say some really nasty, awful things.  Just break out the atom bomb.  Break out, literally.  I know.  How about MADD?  Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
[01:07:00]  Those little kids, the video, they show the awful footage of the kids who were killed by drunks.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What are you going to argue with that?  Right.  You know, we shouldn't, these mandatory checkpoints are unconstitutional.  I don't care what you're saying.  Yeah.  Come on, you just can't.  Shut your mouth, you skinny bitch.  Let's go to the phone.  Chris, a girl in California.  A girl.  Chris.  Yeah.  What's up, Chris?  Hi, Chris.  Hi.  How are you?  What's going on?  What do you mean?  Take it down a notch.  It's pretty early for you, isn't it, Chris?  I have like three people talking on my phone right now. 
[01:07:30]  Well, okay, we'll do one at a time.  It's early there, isn't it?  What are you up to, Chris?  It's pretty early.  It's like 20 to 5.  Yeah, we can figure it out, but what are you up to?  You know, do I want to tell you?  Yeah, yeah.  You've been out all night?  No, I've been home all night.  You've been home, but you've been drinking at home?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  You with a guy?  For 20 years.  Oh. 
[01:08:00]  I've never been married.  You know, I'm like old school, kind of, you know.  Oh, my God.  You're an old poor Al Capaldi.  Oh, my God.  Get to the point.  So what made you call us today?  I get really intimidated by you guys, and I want to go, and I talk back, and I'm like,  fuck you.  I'm sorry about my language, but, you know, I get really mad because it's like, who the  hell are these people that make them so much better?  But you know what?  I keep turning to your radio station.  We're not better.  Yes, we are.  Chris is trying to say that we're very intimidating to listen to. 
[01:08:30]  Huh?  What?  No, go ahead.  What are you saying, little person?  I'm just trying to explain your stupid point.  No, you guys were talking about, oh, God, there you are.  See, he does that, right?  That's like, you're like my fucking, you're like my conscience, man.  Stop.  We're like your conscience?  Why?  Are we all yelling, kill yourself?  Yeah, stop cursing.  Try to keep the potty mouth to a minimum there, Chris.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Northern or Southern California.  Oh, I'm not really sorry, but, uh.  It comes down to this.  We can't be bothered with stupid people.  Okay, look.  Where are you from, Sacramento?  Yeah, where are you from? 
[01:09:00]  In California.  California.  Um, we're, I wasn't born in California.  Where are you calling from right now?  I'm calling from Novato.  Novato, California?  All right.  Chris.  Why is he laughing?  See, we're-  Because you sound like an ass.  That's why he's laughing.  Chris, make your point so we can move on with the phone.  Yeah, why did you call us?  I, uh, called you because you guys were talking, um, you said that we could call and talk about  anything.  What do you want to talk about?  Okay, so what do you want to talk about?  How come I've got two people on the phone? 
[01:09:30]  Doesn't matter!  Because it's a radio show.  We have microphones.  Just answer.  Stop asking questions.  Stop asking.  Why don't you just ask, hey, where's Ben Sparks?  We'd all like to know.  Why don't you start just saying what it is you want to talk about?  Yeah.  Uh, Chris, you're on the air.  What do you want to say?  Okay, this is what I wanted to say first.  All right.  Uh, try not to intimidate me too much, okay?  Say it!  Just say it.  Say it or I'm going to punch you.  Okay?  Okay, what do you want to say?  Uh, my mom, I was supposed to be born, like, today, yesterday, right? 
[01:10:00]  Six, six, 1960.  Right.  Old lady, but, uh, I'm not really old.  You know, I'm, like, pretty young at heart.  I have five kids.  Yuck.  But, uh, I still look okay for things.  No, you don't.  You should treat them like the Yates children.  They'd be better off.  All right.  Rub-a-dub-dub, more money saved around the holidays.  So, now, what is it you want to say?  Five little empty boxes under the Christmas tree.  You know what?  I love my kids very much, and they love me, and I have them.  And we don't give a crap.  They're embarrassed by you.  You're a, you were the same guy for 20 years, you floozy. 
[01:10:30]  He won't marry you.  They're embarrassed by mom and her horrid antics.  I asked him to marry me.  Quiet, you pabst, blue ribbon drinker.  Horrid antics.  I want to marry you.  Calling radio shows all sloshed in bed at whatever time it is over there, 4.30 in the morning.  Don't you work?  Yeah, I work every day.  What do you do?  I take care of children, and, uh...  Uh-oh.  That's good.  Just your own, or like in a daycare center?  Who do you work with?  Tommy Lee?  You sound really competent.  The McMartin preschool?  Where, where do you work that you can go in drunk, because... 
[01:11:00]  What, what does that matter?  Well...  We're curious.  Oh my God, she's driving me nuts.  Just answer the question.  You stink as a human.  I just love that she's hammered.  You stink as a human.  Yeah, you're really a bad person, Chris.  Can we cut our losses?  Let's take a vote.  Can you what?  We're voting whether we continue humoring you, or if we should hang up on you.  I want to give her 30 more seconds. 
[01:11:30]  All right, you got 30 seconds, Chris.  30 seconds.  Chris, Chris, what are you calling for?  I was trying to tell you guys something about the 666 thing, okay?  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.  And I wanted to ask you a question, since you're like professionals, right?  Okay, go ahead.  Oh my God.  Just do it, stupid.  Give me a chance, and you know what?  Talk, you drunken old whore!  I'm like my fucking kid.  I'm like your kid?  Why?  Am I also embarrassed by your alcoholism?  Shut up, radio station caller.  Just hang up the phone and take care of some children, you incompetent drunk who's not 
[01:12:00]  married, and God Almighty, enough coddling you.  And here's something, Chris, we're not talking to you personally, so how can we intimidate  you?  Well, we are now, but when you listen to the show on the radio, we're not talking to you.  We're talking to millions of people.  Chris, you ruined us.  Stop cursing, you potty-mouthed, unmarriable, five children having whore.  Hang up and realize when you listen to this show, we're not talking to you personally.  You're not worthy of love. 
[01:12:30]  That's why you're not married.  I tried.  This is what I-  You had 30 extra seconds, and she babbled.  Oh my God, what a yammering boob.  This is what's great about getting back on commercial radio, by the way.  You get to talk to some of the crazies out there.  There ain't.  Believe me, she ain't listening to satellite radio.  No.  She doesn't even know what it is.  No, has no clue.  No clue.  She's a drunken son.  I just think so bad.  Shut up.  All right, it's crying day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's get to a few of these clips.  We got lots of them. 
[01:13:00]  We got sports, uh, sports heroes crying.  We got celebrities crying.  We'll start, uh, with a few sports heroes or what?  Yeah.  Sports heroes crying.  Always very sad.  What did he just hand you?  Chick who said she wowed on feedback.  Oh, this is the girl that's going to be out there wowing in Massapequa?  Well, where's she going to be?  Because I think guys, uh, really need to see this girl wow in Massapequa.  She's like busty.  Ooh, she'll be at Ronnie, uh, Kovic's old house.  All right.  Well, she's very nice. 
[01:13:30]  She's, uh, she's beautiful.  She's a dish.  She's not a slob.  That's nice to see.  A dish.  We got some beautiful women listening to the program.  What's Bob Kelly doing on television?  That's a sumo wrestler.  Oh.  Wait till you see his dumb face.  He has hair just like Bob.  I know that doesn't work for radio.  Oh, he's an ass.  That's stupid Bob Kelly.  All right, here we go.  Crying audio.  Let's start, uh, we got to get back on track.  That Chris just was a buzzkill.  Yeah.  Uh, she was a great drunk from California. 
[01:14:00]  Uh, Chris is a professional radio show break.  Yes, that's Steven from Bayshore.  Okay, here we go.  Um, it's crying day on the ONA program.  We're going to start with Chad Johnson from the Cincinnati Bengals.  All right.  Want to explain this?  We can't get enough of the crying guys.  When men cry, men, sports figures when they're retiring usually.  Right.  Or, uh, sometimes it's just, you know, talking about their team or whatever.  They get a little emotional and, uh, they start crying.  And it's those clips that are just, they're cringe inducing. 
[01:14:30]  And you know damn well that right after it happens, they're, they regret doing it.  Uh, and then they have to relive it every time it's played.  Yeah.  Uh, it's a, it's a, a, a cringy douche chili thing that you got to listen to.  And, uh, and the sports columnist, the sports columnist give us crap, uh, for just enjoying  this.  Yeah.  You know, the guy got emotional.  He's been in the sport for 20 years and he, uh, breaks up a little bit.  I'm like, no.  And jerks like Opie and Anthony make fun of it.  How can you not just, wouldn't you run through it? 
[01:15:00]  I'd run through the speech in front of a mirror until I was impervious to anything like with,  with sick children pictures and, and just like people with cancer and things that really,  uh, uh, are supposed to make you cry and feel emotion.  And then I'd read my speech and then I would bring it to the press.  So I would come out like a robot.  It's like, I am leaving after 20 years.  I had a great time.  Goodbye.  I will never see the field again. 
[01:15:30]  And I'm okay with that now.  And notice it's bad enough.  A lot of them just, you know, tear up and sniffles and do this.  But when they, when they go up a few octaves, it's the most embarrassing.  Well, let's start with Chad Johnson.  We'll start easy.  And then we got some Dick Vermeule.  We got, uh, Mike Schmidt.  Mike Schmidt's one of the best, worst ever.  All right.  Here's, uh, here's Chad Johnson.  First trading for this first loss.  Yeah, man.  We're not supposed to lose.  You can't be satisfied.  4-1 is not satisfying.  This ain't satisfying.  That's the whole point, man. 
[01:16:00]  That's, we, we supposed to be out of that stage.  We ain't supposed to lose no more.  Games ain't supposed, ain't supposed to be close games.  Like these games, we got to win.  These are times we got to win.  And they wonder why we don't get Monday, Sunday night games.  Man, we got to win stuff like this, man.  No.  They ain't supposed to be close no more.  That's the Bengals are old.  This is a better team than a show tonight, then?  Yeah.  And we got to do it every time we come out.  We got to do it.  We can't keep talking about it.  Man, we talk about the same thing all the time. 
[01:16:30]  But we got to keep doing it.  Obviously, obviously this is a little emotional for you.  Man.  I'm going one.  And that is not all right.  That ain't all right.  Thanks, Chad.  There you go.  There's Chad.  Chad Johnson from the Cincinnati Bengals.  Stop whining.  You know who else is crying?  Anyone who speaks proper English in this country.  Blubbering idiot.  No, Mo.  No, Mo. 
[01:17:00]  No, Mo.  Hey, where did Mo go?  Who is supposed to talk like that?  Have 1860.  You idiot.  No, Mo.  What a dope.  Oh, that is embarrassing.  Yeah.  He loses an ESPN game and he's emotional.  Yeah, it wasn't even a retirement or anything.  The team wasn't, you know, playing up to snuff.  He got a little emotional about that.  All right, let's get right into the Mike Schmidt.  Mike Schmidt.  Now we take it up a notch here.  This one's bad. 
[01:17:30]  Crying day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Mike Schmidt's retirement.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio, with two very bad knees.  Oh, boy.  And a dream to become a major league baseball player.  I beg God, the dream came true.  That's horrific.  That's horrific. 
[01:18:00]  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I hate this picture.  God, why?  How many people have to look down as they're at the press conference?  Oh, boy.  It's bad enough to just tear up and get choked up.  And, you know, it's been a great career.  And the team is wonderful.  And God bless everybody.  And you walk off.  But when he's like, when you go up a few octaves, wow, that is bad.  There's no crying in baseball. 
[01:18:30]  He left Ohio with two bad knees.  Why?  Was he prostituting to put himself through college?  You got a hold of yourself, you mustachioed faggot.  You're a millionaire.  He's got to look back at that like, I really shouldn't have ended my career like that.  Cobbering ass.  And, you know, a few years go by, and then you've got to think his pals just, like, have  to be killing him.  Oh, hey, they're all sitting around watching the game.  Hey, could you grab me a beer?  Like, just everything they say to him. 
[01:19:00]  You think Ty Cobb cried like that?  No.  The only times Ty Cobb, Ty Cobb, Ty Cobb, Ty Cobb, Ty Cobb, Ty Cobb, Ty Cobb, Ty Cobb,  very good.  I had that little rice.  There's two times, actually, he cried.  Jackie Robinson, Larry Dolby.  Goddamn Lou Gehrig barely, you know, got emotional.  He's dying.  He knew he didn't have much time left.  He's calling himself the luckiest man in the world.  He was stupid.  Very stupid.  He was the most unlucky man in the world. 
[01:19:30]  That's pretty unlucky.  For the time.  All right, let's go to Dick Vermeule.  This is a great one, too.  Oh, I had enough of Dick Vermeule.  I'm so appreciative of what my coaching staff has done.  Yeah, are you?  Are these players?  Jesus.  Are these players?  These are my boys.  Why, did they save a life?  Did they cure cancer?  Or did they take a ball and run past a white line, you horse and ass? 
[01:20:00]  The coaching staff did what they were paid to do.  Shut up.  Blue.  You're my boy.  God almighty.  Am I the only man?  You know, she was beautiful.  I loved her.  And then her wing fell off.  And I realized she had muscled arms.  We got to hear that.  I stopped it.  We got to start over.  I'm so appreciative of what my coaching staff has done. 
[01:20:30]  And these players.  Jesus.  And the ones.  Excuse me.  Okay, girl.  These guys are unbelievable people.  Nobody knows these guys, except maybe their moms and dads, or wives, better than I know them.  Right.  Yeah, sounds like you really know them.  Ray Carruth's coach wasn't crying that hard when he got the news.  Stupid ass.  Isn't that one a good one? 
[01:21:00]  By the way, people have been calling out Elo.  Yeah.  In 100 years, there will be another 6-6-0-6.  Not 1,000.  What does it matter?  We'll all be dead.  Well, I don't know.  It doesn't really matter.  Yeah, Elo's a dope.  He doesn't know any better.  100-1-1-1,000.  What's the difference?  It wouldn't be 6-6-6, though, really?  Because it's 21-0-6 at that point.  6-6-0-6.  Still 0-6.  You would still do the 0-6 at that point?  Oh, I guess.  The only one that really worked is the year 6. 
[01:21:30]  June 6th, the year 6, was the only real 6-6-6.  After that, don't put a 0 in front of it.  It's stupid.  It's not to say, sign of the B, 6-6-0-6.  It's an abbreviation.  It is.  But it's 0-6.  By the way, Eric, I don't like you in glasses.  Go ahead.  Steven.  He's trying to be the smart hawk, you dope.  Steven from Bayshore.  Yes.  When Garrick said that he was the luckiest man in the world,  he meant he was not going to live to see the color it's allowed into baseball. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  Hey, man.  They ride him.  I got to read him.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Oh, from Brooklyn.  The funny thing about that Vermeule clip is that as soon as he blubbers,  the cameras really start clicking.  Yeah.  But it's like, could you get more than one line into the speech  before you lose it, you emotional wreck?  Is he bipolar?  Good afternoon, people in the press.  This is going to be a long one.  That won't happen on the drive-in. 
[01:22:30]  I can see you thanking your dad for that catch you had when you were four.  Yeah.  But God Almighty, when you get into the trainer and the coaching staff,  for Christ's sake, get a hold of yourself.  Even Bud R. Dwyer didn't start crying before he blew his head off.  Our Bud Dwyer.  Our Bud Dwyer.  Sorry, yeah.  Bud R. Dwyer.  Our Bud Dwyer.  That was the guy who carried the actual paper bag inside the gun  and put it over his head.  But he didn't start babbling and crying.  No, he didn't.  He just got the job done.  All right, here's a wrestling fan just crying away. 
[01:23:00]  I just want to thank each.  It's kind of like a seminar.  He's talking to some wrestlers in some gym somewhere.  I'm sure.  He stands up for the.  Locker room naked.  He stands up for the Q&A.  For the Q&A, and here it is.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies.  It's still real to me, damn it.  I'll be.  Thank you, guys.  You're awesome. 
[01:23:30]  Thank you so much, Mr. Funk, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Is that Fez Watley?  It's still real to me.  It's still real to me, damn it.  What is this guy talking about, Iraq?  You're a big wrestling fan.  No, that was Iraq.  What were you saying there, Iraq?  What was that about?  Were you having a Hulkamaniac moment?  Was he wearing his red boots?  Did he play his little guitar?  I want to be a Hulkamaniac. 
[01:24:00]  It's a guy in a gym.  They had some old washed-up wrestlers there, and they just were taking questions from the audience,  and he just started balling up.  I said all that.  Yeah.  This sounds like even though.  I said all that, Iraq.  I'm looking for more.  He's looking for a little bit of insight.  A little bit of insight.  What the host said.  Iraq's a yes, man.  He'll just yes you.  Yeah, that's what you said, Opie.  It sounds like some guy who, like, even though it's sports entertainment, 
[01:24:30]  and they fessed up to the fact that, you know, it's scripted, that it's still real to him.  That's kind of what it sounded like he was getting at.  Will you please hear just the beginning of that?  I got to hear the whole thing again.  This guy is a bumbling ass.  Gina Marie's back.  She wants to whip him out.  It's whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  Get the wow stickers on your car.  Blah, blah, blah.  She's now in the instant feedback.  One more thing I thought I should tell you guys to tell your fans.  My husband is out of town today, so I'm all alone.  You never know what I may get into. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, it's just updated in the middle of this.  Get into with the right O&A fan.  I'll be at the Sunrise Mall, and I drive a black BMW.  Oh, nice.  Sunrise Mall.  Look out for any cinder blocks going through your windshield.  I hear that mall's getting too white.  What else is he's going to be flashing at the Sunrise Mall?  Someone's in the area.  Please let us know what's going on there.  Okay.  Hey, oh, you want to hear the wrestling guy again?  Of course.  Oh, my God.  How can we...  Actually, I can listen to that.  Fry, baby.  Is this the best one so far?  Yeah, just put it on a loop.  I just want to thank each and every one of you for all you've done to your bodies. 
[01:25:30]  It's still real to me, damn it.  I'll be...  Thank you, man.  All right, that's...  You're wrong.  Hold it.  Hold it.  You can hear a wrestler in the background go, take it easy, man.  One of the guys tells him to take it easy.  Not even one of the big wrestlers, just some fat guy in a Tesla shirt.  It's just Jack Black.  It's still real to me, man. 
[01:26:00]  Damn it.  Damn it.  He has to get manly.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Damn it.  I'll be...  Make it easy, man.  Thank you, guys.  You're awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Funk, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thank you.  Wow.  Another one of these.  What was it?  Was it a college application?  Well, that's what I was asking Iraq, but he had nothing.  A woman's lap.  Do you now know what he's talking about?  It was after Eddie Guerrero died. 
[01:26:30]  He didn't want to see another death in wrestling.  Oh.  Oh.  Why?  Why wouldn't you?  Thanks.  Ten minutes later.  Yeah, Hawk.  All right.  Dick Vermeule.  Oh, Eric didn't know.  He didn't know.  He's a good boy.  He wasn't listening is what it comes down to.  So he repeated what I already said, but I was looking for more insight.  And now five, six minutes later, we get to the insight.  What are those, by the way, headphones you have?  Are those headphones you have?  Why do you have them in your ear like Charles McCord?  Because I have to wear these, too.  He doesn't want to mess up his hairdo. 
[01:27:00]  Don't get started on the poor lad.  He's a good boy.  Smack his face.  I never saw a guy that has a full head of hair look like it's plugs.  It's the most bizarre thing ever.  Leave Hawaiian hair do alone.  He's got a full head of hair, but it looks like those commercials on TV where it's so obvious they got plugs.  And I know he doesn't have plugs.  A whole faithful head.  All right. 
[01:27:30]  More Dick Vermeule.  It's crying day on the O.P. and Anthony show.  I think Lamar, Norma, you people, you people are so special to me.  To provide me with this opportunity to represent your family and your organization with Carl and Lori is second to none.  We didn't win a Super Bowl for you.  But in some ways, I think we got some things done within me, within our organization, within our players and our family here that maybe I'd never experienced before. 
[01:28:00]  And I appreciate so much our relationship and the opportunity that you and Carl provided for me and my family.  And I'll always cherish it.  And I am a chief.  And you're the foundation of this organization.  And sooner or later, Carl's going to take you to the Super Bowl.  This poor family. 
[01:28:30]  Last time my father cried like this was when he heard about Pete Townsend and Gary Glitter.  His email buddies.  All right.  When we get back, we'll get into celebrities crying, including our own Bob Kelly breaking his knee.  That's one of the best crying clips.  Yeah.  We got Andrew Dice Clay crying, Bruce Kelly crying, Halle Berry crying.  Bruce Kelly and Bob Kelly?  Wow.  How about just people?  Tom Sizemore crying in court.  We got lots of crying clips.  All right. 
[01:29:00]  Lots more sports clips.  But we're going to move on to the celebrities after the break.  We'll go to break with, we played this the other day, but we've got to play it again.  Brett Boone crying as he retired.  Pretty sad day for me.  You know, I've gone through a lot in this city.  A lot of great times.  And we've scuffled a lot last year and a half. 
[01:29:30]  And then, I feel like a baby.  But the city's been so great to me.  You are.  And I've had a lot of success here.  Played with some great guys.  Great people just around.  And the fans have always been, you know, awesome.  Great times.  Tough times.  You guys have been good to me. 
[01:30:00]  Good times.  And I appreciate that.  And there you have it.  You know who I want to hear the clip from?  Yeah.  Crying like that.  Heidi Klum's father.  She's so beautiful.  I can't believe she let her body be ruined by it.  Yeah, my help.  Yeah, that'd be a crying clip, all right?  Yeah, we'll think of more crying situations as you guys take a break with us. 
[01:30:30]  I'm a little girl.  It's the RNA virus.  I need to pass her on my lap.  Spreading across America.  Now she's with her.  I wish I could find the words.  I wish I could say the words.  He may be famous, but he's still just...  When you raise a girl her whole life, 
[01:31:00]  You're just the last thing you want is you'll bring it home.  I could have had him shot.  Could have been a...  But no, it had to be a...  Hold on. 
[01:31:30]  Hold on.  I'm almost done.  I'm kind of tearing up.  You know,  I'm not going to dispute his talents.  Guy's got a great singing voice in me,  But...  But is it?  It's my girl! 
[01:32:00]  Why was the...  All right.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I gotta go now.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show  On this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Make sure you get your wow stickers.  We're being heard on some fine commercial radio stations 
[01:32:30]  Across America.  Hopefully, they have info on their website  On how you can get the wow stickers.  I know YSP has info on their website.  I know WBCN up in Boston has info on their website.  I know West Palm Beach is really getting into  The whole Whip-Em-Out Wednesday thing.  You get the wow on your car,  Whether it's a homemade wow sign  Or a wow sticker.  It does two things.  It supports the Opie and Anthony show.  And also,  If you're lucky enough,  Some fine, fine young lady,  Hopefully a young lady,  Will be flashing you 
[01:33:00]  As you drive around town.  Okay?  Right.  I've been getting a lot of emails  From Pittsburgh as well.  Yeah, Pittsburgh.  It seems to be working in Pittsburgh  A little bit.  We should say hi to Pittsburgh today.  The All-Star game is going to be  Down in Pittsburgh.  And Elo was asking us yesterday  If we want to broadcast live from Pittsburgh  For the All-Star game.  Oh, he did, huh?  We should talk about that.  It could be a cool thing, no?  When?  When?  July.  I don't know.  July, right?  You want to get back to the crying stuff? 
[01:33:30]  Love the crying.  What happened?  I'm asking Eric to look up the All-Star game.  Men crying.  Okay.  Sportsmen.  Celebrity men.  You want to listen?  Someone said Bob Kelly is not a celebrity.  He's a person who has been recorded on tape.  That accurately depicts his career.  Absolutely.  Bruce Kelly is not a celebrity.  The truth hurts.  You want to go back to the Bruce Kelly?  We played that the other day.  Or Andrew Dice Clay?  Bruce Kelly into Dice. 
[01:34:00]  I love the Bruce Kelly.  All right, let's do Bruce Kelly again.  How somebody got so teared up over seeing The Who in, you know, maybe if you're a Woodstock  on some acid and you're seeing The Who and, you know.  Yeah, he was over there across the pond, as they like to say.  Oh, right.  It's because it's so big to call it a pond is silly.  It doesn't make sense.  There's salt water in it, too.  And they did a whole thing at Live Aid, and Bruce Kelly was the representation for XM Satellite  Radio.  Yeah.  And The Who just got off the stage, and they decided to talk to Bruce Kelly. 
[01:34:30]  And while I was playing, there was also, there was a lot of video of, like, African children  and stuff.  African children crying, not crying, starving.  Right.  The crying ones were on Townsend's computer.  The starving ones were on the monitors.  That wasn't even what broke him up.  That wasn't even why he started crying.  Yeah.  It was the fact that he was watching The Who.  The Who.  Not the kids starving to death in Africa. 
[01:35:00]  The Dramatica montage didn't get him.  It was Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey doing the same old Who songs that we've all seen  a million times.  I personally have gone to five farewell tours.  What about you, Anthony?  Yeah, I've been to a couple, yeah.  I've actually...  You should be going to a farewell tour once.  I saw two-thirds of The Who.  No, three-quarters.  Yeah, three-quarters of The Who.  He's crying over seeing half of The Who. 
[01:35:30]  Half The Who.  He saw a W and one line with the stick kind of going halfway across.  Off of there.  Well, here he is, Bruce Kelly crying right after The Who finished.  Yeah.  Live on the radio for the entire country.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under these phone talks.  You know, it's amazing watching Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey perform these songs after  all these years and still have the full spirit of what they do under control. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, you know, Townsend just continues to be an amazing guitar player.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't.  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of...  No crap.  No fake.  It kind of got to me with that video.  Yeah, the video was very powerful.  Yeah, yeah, that was...  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry, but it was just very...  I mean, you know, it's just The Who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with The Who. 
[01:36:30]  And that's it.  I'm sorry.  You were seeing them live.  I guess that was in color.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were live on stage, but the black and white was happening on the big screens,  too, so...  Through your tears.  Wow.  So there's two more to go here at Hyde Park and the crowd...  I feel like an idiot.  I'm sorry, really.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  That's what this...  You know, that really is what this is all about.  There are certain moments that touch everybody.  No, it's not.  To what?  Behave like an unprofessional fatso? 
[01:37:00]  And by the way, who's that guy's name who has the voice?  George Taylor Morris.  Great voice, but his dreck that he was spinning at the beginning.  Ah, they have the same spirit.  Shut up.  Do you think he was looking, though, and saying, oh my God, this guy isn't ready to come  on the air.  I got to stretch this out by just, you know, like babbling.  Yeah.  Because this idiot is going to cry.  Yeah.  He's going to get on...  Like he was trying to save him.  And then it just got to the point where, no, Bruce...  Because most broadcasters won't go with the crying thing.  Yeah.  They'll try to help the guy out.  Yeah.  So he's like, just to see the who up there again, just giving what they do and this blah, 
[01:37:30]  blah.  Okay.  I got nothing left.  I think he's doing...  Go ahead and cry.  I think he's...  I think he's doing what's called Phil in the business.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because he sees Bruce Kelly to the side with tissues and everything, blowing his big honker.  Absolutely crying.  I'm watching the hoot play and above the plane video of starving.  Hit that.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  All right.  I heard something.  So there's Bruce Kelly crying at Live 8 after the hoop performed, one of our favorite 
[01:38:00]  clips of all time.  Can't get enough of it.  Don't we have Bruce Kelly remixes and all that, too?  Oh, yeah.  We pounded him on that.  We'd get him on the air and just start crying as we're talking to him.  So, Bruce, how are you?  I miss Bruce, too.  I like him a lot, man.  Yeah.  He got fired.  Yeah.  I mean, he left for better things, bigger opportunities.  Yeah.  I know what that means.  It's being broadcast out of his living room. 
[01:38:30]  It was mutual.  I love how they spin things on radio.  They said, get out.  And he said, OK.  You get that email.  Blah, blah is leaving for bigger and better things.  He's going to be exploring other opportunities.  Yeah.  But if you see this person in the building, please report to.  So agreeable.  All right.  Here we go.  No, there's not any audio of me crying when I saw that 40 grand was gone from my bankers.  My bank account when my ex-wife took it. 
[01:39:00]  There should be.  All right.  I miss that money.  Let's go with Andrew Dice Clay crying.  Yeah.  On Arsenio Hall.  This is more dramatic than an actual cry.  Oh.  He has to tell everybody who Andrew Dice Clay really is.  What an ass.  People go, you know, what's the real Andrew Clay Silverstein?  Who is that other, you know, opposed to Dice?  Mm-hmm.  You know, because I get, you know, who's Dice? 
[01:39:30]  Who's Andrew Clay?  Who's the Jewish kid?  Who's the guy that's acting Italian?  You know, I get a...  Well, you want to know who he is?  I'll tell you.  Andrew Clay.  No, let me get this straight.  And everybody watching and everybody in the studio should hear it.  Andrew Clay is the guy that came out here about ten years ago.  And broke his ass.  You know what I mean?  Broke his ass.  He believed in himself. 
[01:40:00]  Became the hottest comic in the world.  And anybody that doesn't like it can wipe their ass with whatever they say about me.  Yeah, huh?  Oh.  He's trying to be serious and the crowd starts laughing.  The crowd's laughing.  Came out here, dude.  He did the Fonzie cry where Fonzie got all broken up, I think, on a Christmas episode.  Ew, did he?  Oh, yeah.  Justice.  Came out here. 
[01:40:30]  The Poster Dukes.  Why can't a guy be sensitive without being laughed at?  The audience is laughing at me.  Yeah, they are.  You're trying to show your other side, right, Dice?  Sensitive Dice.  Sensitive Dice.  You know?  I like a basket full of kittens.  Sometimes that'll just make me weep.  I see a basket with a little, like, one's black and white and there's a calico. 
[01:41:00]  And their eyes are so big and blue.  And they start playing with that little ball of yarn?  The yarn ball.  They're playing with their yarn balls.  Just clawing at the yarn balls.  Oh!  Then I get busted out.  I just got to take my mind off of it and take my bedazzler and put more BS on my back. 
[01:41:30]  I got to put sensitive Dice Clay.  Is it true you were at Live 8 and you also cried after seeing The Who?  Yeah!  I said, who?  They're like, where?  Who?  Who's in this band?  I don't know those two guys.  But they're playing.  And, you know, the poor little colored children are starving.  And I'm like, Gage!  Is it true you really started breaking down after they sang Who Are You? 
[01:42:00]  Who are you?  And you were thinking who you may be, Dice?  I thought, who am I?  Andrew Dice Clay?  The guy that tries to act Italian?  Andrew Silverstein?  The Jew?  Or am I Andrew who?  The Chinaman?  Maybe I'm Andrew Dice Klavowski?  The Polak?  Who am I?  Oh!  That one got to you at the Who show.  But I'm sensitive.  No one knows what it's like to be the... 
[01:42:30]  The sad man?  Yeah, yeah.  Behind blue eyes?  Yeah.  Blue eyes!  She needed the money!  Oh!  Eeeh!  Sometimes I go to weddings.  Yeah.  Sensitive Dice, not the one from the stage.  Yeah.  And I go to a wedding, and I sit down, and I see the bride and groom, and I think, you 
[01:43:00]  know, that could be me in a different life, finding love.  Yeah.  Finding love with a woman, and going on a honeymoon, and going to bed, and just guise, guise, guise.  What about at the wedding, when they do Daddy's Little Girl?  That's a rough one for you.  Hey!  Right? 
[01:43:30]  Not too predictable, by the way, huh?  Daddy's Little Girl.  They dance.  Yeah.  She stands on his shoes.  Yeah.  Because she's 10.  Oh!  Sensitive Dice Clay.  Sensitive Dice.  You put yourself out there.  Yeah.  They don't know me.  They don't know I cry.  I cry, and I ask, Jesus, why during my hardest times, where they're just one set of footprints, 
[01:44:00]  and he said, that's when I carried you.  I have that next to my hanging there kitten poster.  He's hanging on the pole.  Hang in there, kitty. 
[01:44:30]  Ugly.  All right.  Well, there's Andrew Dice Clay having a moment.  See me.  Feel me.  Touch me.  Heal me.  See me. 
[01:45:00]  Feel me.  Touch me.  Tommy, can you hear me?  Can you feel me near you?  Tommy.  Hey, Tommy.  You hear me?  He's deaf and dumb and blind.  Poor Tommy.  See me.  I hear you. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Andrew Dice Clay having a moment there.  Very good.  A little sensitive.  Bravo.  He's very sensitive.  That was Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  Well, they get it confused.  Someone out there wants to know if I'm still playing EverQuest.  I'm like, no.  It's me.  I never played it a minute in my life.  Hey, Eric Bennett.  Bennett, how do you say Halle Berry's ex's name there?  Benet.  Eric Benet.  Ramsey.  He was on Dateline right around the time he was getting a divorce from Halle Berry. 
[01:46:00]  Blame him for crying.  No kidding.  Excuse me.  Did she call Halle mommy?  I don't want to do this.  I mean, she's lost one mother.  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Wait.  Wait.  Just give me one second.  Um, it's been difficult.  It's been difficult.  In the last ten months, how much has India seen Halle?  Um, not, not, not very much.  Not very much.  She was digging.  Oh, yeah, she was.  She was digging.  Oh, yeah, that's her job.  Stupid vulture.  That's the job of the reporter when they, they see that, uh, that glare in your eye. 
[01:47:00]  Seen it, uh, getting all glassy.  Yep.  This footage of Ozzy crying from, uh.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got to get that.  What happened?  When we were talking about Sharon's cancer on Barbara Walters.  Oh, yeah, well.  Yeah.  Pretty good reason.  Yeah.  It was miserable.  Man, he was bummed out.  Yeah.  He wasn't going to get any of that, you know what.  That.  Christmas shoes.  You ever hear the song Christmas Shoes? 
[01:47:30]  Christmas shoes, guys.  The boy is buying shoes for his dying mommy.  But he ain't got no money.  So I'm in line and I got my tongue up there.  Christmas shoes.  Who likes Christmas Shoes?  Anthony likes that song.  No.  Oh, uh, Sal.  Yeah, Sal.  You're, uh, my stepfather.  I love the impression of when he goes, this song is really sad. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  What?  When you do, you do Sal's voice.  Oh, Sal.  Where?  Oh, Ro, the song gets me all every time, Ro.  He's from Baltimore.  He used to be a big union guy.  Ro, yeah.  And now Christmas Shoes makes a union delegate and Christmas Shoes comes on and he gets all  misty.  Oh, look, I'm tearing up like I'm a girl.  Yeah.  You are, Sal.  Christmas Shoes.  Shoes, Ro.  Christmas Shoes. 
[01:48:30]  Shoes.  Baltimore action is the worst.  There's Don Joseph and Anthony.  Christmas Shoes.  It's all, oh, nothing worse than seeing an old guy crying.  No.  All right.  Here's, uh, Halle Berry.  Now we got Halle Berry.  Her, uh, Oscar.  Oh, God, yeah.  The Oscar acceptance.  Oh, this is great.  Listen to this.  But she's a chick.  She's still a blubbering ass in this, though.  And she's barely black, let's be honest.  Yeah.  She's got a white Jewish mother.  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[01:49:00]  Make me feel good.  Wow.  Make me feel good.  She couldn't even start.  Make me feel good.  Oh.  Monster's Ball was the hottest scenes ever.  Make me feel good.  Yeah.  That's the scene black people hate as much as we hate.  That scene in traffic.  Billy Bob.  Where she's in bed with the drug dealer guy.  Ah, the scene in traffic is so hot. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, it's awful.  Little rich girl.  She's, uh, hooked on the junk.  Yeah.  And, uh, Michael Douglas is, uh, pretty close to finding her.  She's, uh, he's at the door, right?  Yeah, yeah.  While she's naked in the other room with the big black guy over her just pounding her.  Yeah.  Ouch.  I didn't think that was particularly hot.  No, it was painful to watch.  Yeah.  I did mumble lucky girl a couple of times.  What did Barry win for?  Did she win for Monster's Ball?  Uh, is this for Monster's Ball? 
[01:50:00]  Oh, okay.  Well, here's Halle Berry's, uh, acceptance speech.  Oh, my God.  This moment is so much bigger than me. 
[01:50:30]  This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diane Carroll.  It's for the women that stand beside me.  Hey, where are the white women at?  I can't even listen.  This is sad.  I want to know, why is she only thanking me? 
[01:51:00]  Remember the embarrassing moment when Sidney Poitier got up to, uh, accept.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  We got, uh, we got, uh, we got some audience members, uh, at the Oscars when, uh, it was  announced that Halle Berry was going to win the, uh, Academy Award, Anthony.  Let's hear.  Some of the old school, uh, actors there, uh, reacted a little differently. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Oh, good Lord.  Yeah.  One of the, uh, one of the older, uh, members of the Academy, uh, if there was a microphone  in his brain.  Oh.  Wait, was she the first black woman to win?  I don't know.  For best ask, she was.  I think she was.  I don't know. 
[01:52:00]  We don't need to take, we don't need to keep track of that stuff.  That's right.  They keep track of that stuff.  Like, didn't Abroad from, uh, uh.  Oh, it was, uh, Gone with the Wind.  Yeah, that's what I meant, the family.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  She won for playing a major.  Best something supporting, no?  Yeah, something.  All right, here we go.  It's for the women that stand beside me.  Jada Pinkett, Angela Masson, Vivica Fox, and it's for every nameless, faceless woman of  color that now has a chance, because this door tonight has been opened. 
[01:52:30]  It's been opened for a long time before this.  Of course, it has you, Goose.  Pulled yourself up by your bootstraps.  I'm so honored.  I'm so honored.  I'm so honored to thank the Academy for choosing me to be the vessel, but which is blessing  my flow.  Thank you.  What? 
[01:53:00]  Right here.  This blessing flowing from her vessel?  What was up with Jada Pinkett?  Sounds dirty.  Yeah.  What?  Jada Pinkett's sitting there watching, going, what do I have to do with this?  We've got Queen Latifah and some other great actresses of color.  Dope.  Tootie from Facts of Lies.  Give us meals.  You left so many people out.  Jada Pinkett.  Rodney Allen Ripio is the guy.  All right.  We've got to take another break.  When we get back, we'll wrap up today's crying day.  We've only touched the surface.  We've got lots of clips to get to tomorrow and Friday, but we'll do Robert Kelly after 
[01:53:30]  the break.  We'll do Tom Sizemore crying in court.  Oh, yeah.  And, oh, Tyra Banks freaking out during America's Next Top Model.  That's really, really good as well.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Who are you telling us?  Shut up.  We're almost done with the first half of the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to meet in the lobby.  We're going to walk over to XM to continue.  We broadcast on XM The Walk.  And today we've got a penthouse pet. 
[01:54:00]  It's raining like crazy out here in New York.  This is what I want to happen.  I want the girl to get into a tight white T-shirt and walk in the rain.  A wife beater.  A wife beater would be nice with no umbrella.  I want to see a nice white T-shirt.  I think we can make that happen on the streets of New York today, okay?  We'll get some good looks, I believe.  Sure.  And we'll videotape it for the people that aren't joining us for The Walk, and that  will be up on the website we can't talk about yet, okay?  Just Google our names to find all our websites. 
[01:54:30]  V. Williams in New York, not happy with the program.  Oh, no.  Today is just the same as yesterday.  No talent at all.  If people of color no longer lived on this earth, you wouldn't have a job.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to make fun of blacks.  Shut up.  Your entire show is...  You're even with the police.  Your entire show is about being racist.  Yeah, of course it is.  You are so sad.  You're not funny or entertaining.  You're just sad.  Then why are you...  Sorry.  A, why are you listening two days in a row? 
[01:55:00]  And B, I bet you that's a white guy.  I'll bet you that's a white guy.  Do you think?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  I know it might be a little late, but if you guys can get your hands on John Sterling's  call from the Yankees-Red Sox game from two nights ago.  Oh, we already played that, bro.  Yeah.  You weren't listening, Kevin in Princeton.  You need to hear his call on Andy Phillips' second inning three-run homer.  Disgusting.  Yeah, we actually did that yesterday.  We got John Sterling's call from last night.  It was a big win for the Yankees over the Sox.  Sorry, Boston. 
[01:55:30]  I'm with you as far as the Sox and the Yankees go.  John Sterling, very dramatic call at the end of the game.  Here it is.  Pitch.  Hit on the ground a second.  Cano feels close to first.  In time.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Do they?  Yes, they did.  We know. 
[01:56:00]  Let's just do that for the rest of the show for V, because we have no talent.  I wish V would call in, because there's nothing worse than either some self-righteous black  guy or some guilty white person complaining about white people doing racial humor.  We were doing the Chinese are coming yesterday, which proves that you're not paying attention.  Well, he didn't say it was all, oh yeah, he did say blacks.  We did a whole Chinese are coming thing yesterday. 
[01:56:30]  It wasn't for people of color.  Wouldn't that be all people, sir?  White people, we just happen to have the best color.  Oh, sorry.  Didn't mean to be rightfully sensitive.  Why don't you die?  It just shows that people are listening.  I love it.  Someone's pointing out V Williams is, you know.  Venus, of course.  Venus, of course.  I wouldn't even acknowledge that.  That little goose.  Yes.  Sorry.  Goose American.  This girl is so sexy.  Well, where is she?  We should bring her in, I guess.  I don't know.  But she has the type of body.  Well, bring her in a couple minutes.  They usually don't have much to say. 
[01:57:00]  She has the type of body.  Jim.  Look at these.  Look at them.  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  Is she sexy.  Let me see.  Oh, I like that.  Wow.  Very nice.  Yeah, we're going to get her in a white wife beater.  And she's going to walk in the rain without an umbrella.  That's what we want her to do.  I'm sure she won't want to do that for some reason.  I don't know.  But that's the bit today because it's pouring out there, right?  It's still raining really hard.  Slow down.  Oh, now it's slowing down.  Well.  Just our luck. 
[01:57:30]  We'll have to soak her down.  All right.  We only have a few minutes left in the show.  Should we do another crying clip here?  I don't know.  This is making me sad.  What?  What's wrong?  Oh, the crying?  Yeah, but it's so sad, Opie.  Well, we could also do eight ways to save gas.  Oh, come on.  Who did that?  We should have so many more.  You know, Fox 5 News.  Do they?  Well, you know, gas prices, they're really outrageous.  Are they?  Oh, cool.  A lot of people are planning their summer trips.  Isn't it interesting?  Yes.  So this should be very helpful for the people out there to save 35 cents. 
[01:58:00]  I mean, how much money do you really save?  How much do you save when you save on gas?  And there'll be somebody out there that'll explain, no, it's more than 35 cents.  We understand that.  Don't make jokes for having money.  XM doesn't like that.  Who?  Who doesn't like that?  I know.  Steven from Bayshore.  Going with the Chinese are coming.  I'm telling you, there's something there.  The Chinese are coming, and they're going to eat all our pets.  Oh, jeez.  That's a stereotype.  I don't think it's very fair.  Don't make fun of people of color. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, no.  We got an error.  I don't like it.  What does an error mean, usually?  Error.  Error.  Uh-oh.  Error.  Eric.  Yeah, see if that works.  Similarity there.  No coincidence.  Stupid 70s rug hairdo.  Is there anything on there?  I don't think so.  Shag carpet.  Exactly.  Not that bad.  Shut up, stupid.  It's awful.  Error.  Bathroom matte hair.  Error.  You should be covering a toilet seat.  You got a full head of hair, but it looks like plugs in front.  You got to do a different hairstyle. 
[01:59:00]  He's doing the spiky thing.  You should have scented soaps behind your skull.  All right.  We can't do it.  Guys, we'll do this on the XM show.  Eight ways to save gas.  Well, you know.  Can we start with the teen man boob surgery that we were talking about?  Yeah, let's hear that.  All right.  We're going to have to save the crying clips for tomorrow when we have a little more time.  I'm scared.  Why are you scared, Jimmy?  I don't know.  We saw this on TV this morning.  It's surgery to get rid of those man boobs.  Some guys get them.  Well, this was a teenager. 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  I'm sure he didn't get teased much.  On to some medical news for you.  It is a problem suffered by millions of boys and men.  Excess breast tissue.  While the condition itself is not harmful, it can be extremely embarrassing.  Now, five weeks ago, we told you the story of a New Jersey teen  who was having a simple surgical procedure to correct the problem.  Eyewitness News reporter Michelle Charlesworth has our update.  This is what Ryan looked like before.  This is what he looks like five weeks after surgery. 
[02:00:00]  This is what he felt like before.  It's really terrible to have to just feel it there.  And just really bad.  And now, this is how he feels.  It's, like, life-changing.  It's awesome.  What's your name, fat body?  He can now take his shirt off at the beach and doesn't worry about being teased ever again.  The thing is, Ryan was not alone.  Look at these before and afters.  His condition, called gynecomastia, is a cosmetic problem that more and more men are getting corrected. 
[02:00:30]  The surgery takes an hour and leaves only a tiny scar under each arm.  His skin is like a young rubber band, and you take out all the tissue underneath, and guess what?  It just snaps back.  Ugh.  Dynomocastia?  Ugh.  I don't know.  Man boobs.  Man boobs.  That should be the doctor walks in, and this should be your surgery.  Do push-ups.  That's all.  Put on a girdle and do a few push-ups. 
[02:01:00]  Punk.  Hey, you little maggot!  You make me want to vomit!  I need some vegetables, you silly goose.  Exactly.  Pow, choke yourself!  Put down the cake and pick up some broccoli.  And of course, now someone will call and explain that even if you do that, you still have this.  Right, it's excess tissue.  But most people have it because they're not, you know, trying to exercise or eat right.  I've heard that excuse from people, how they eat really healthy, and then I've watched them eat, and I'm thinking, no, you don't.  No, you don't.  Notice how I say I'm thinking, because I don't call people out on it, because I'm a coward. 
[02:01:30]  That's the worst thing, though, the man boobs thing.  Yeah.  There's some old guy who used to live next door, and he'd come out without his shirt on all the time, and he had complete breasts.  And he would do calisthenics.  I guess he was an ex-marine or something.  He didn't care.  And they'd flop around, and when you're, you know, I guess seven or something, you look, and it's almost like seeing boobs.  They'd flop around like tassels?  Oh, yeah.  Like tassels.  They just...  Oh, real nasty. 
[02:02:00]  What, the 70-year-old college grad?  Yeah, I'll just point it down and see if I'll grab an audio for you.  Isn't that terrific?  Yeah.  I think we should address her.  Good for her.  Yeah.  That's true.  70 years young.  Is she a cougar in the dorm?  She's a...  Cougar.  She's a crow.  Every year, they gotta have the story about the old bra that graduated college because it was her dream.  Way to go.  What are you gonna do with 70?  Who the hell is hiring her?  Exactly.  Entry-level position. 
[02:02:30]  When you could hire a hot piece of ass.  Right.  That's the reality, ladies.  You should have waited a few years.  You should be in college anyway, in some type of biology lab.  Old cadaver, you.  Exactly.  Let's see.  You graduate college at 70, but the retirement age is 65.  Yeah.  What'd you do for 65 years?  Yeah.  Wasted your time, didn't you?  What did you do?  Raised a family.  And of course.  Now it's your time.  Matt Lauer has the cute banter going back and forth. 
[02:03:00]  Please get this audio for the XM show today.  You know, it's just awful questions.  Smart blue polyester suit.  Why don't they ask real questions?  Like, why are you taking up a seat that somebody with a life ahead of them could use?  That's what I'd like to ask.  Like, considering the fact you'll be dead shortly, why aren't you just enjoying your  golden years?  All right.  Here's the last bit of audio from the teen man boob surgery.  And listen to how much Dr. Jacobs took out.  Think of two eight-ounce glasses of tissue from each side.  Are you kidding me?  It's always, this is like an iceberg. 
[02:03:30]  There's more underneath than what you see on the surface.  Ryan's mom, Candice, says for the last two years, the teasing Ryan's endured has been  brutal and that surgery at 13 was the way to go.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, it's, I, I couldn't have, you know, hoped for anything better.  These days, Ryan says he doesn't hunch over anymore or pull on his shirt to mash down his  chest.  He just feels, quote, normal.  Do you feel like you look hot now on the beach?  Well, I mean, kind of, I guess, if you want to say. 
[02:04:00]  Good for you.  Wasn't that amazing?  Now the doctor says all he has to do is make sure he has sunscreen on top of the scars through  the summer so that the scars will fade.  And he has one more appointment in August, and he's done.  On the Upper East Side, Michelle Charlesworth, Channel 7, Eyewitness News.  He's hot.  Well, you know, Ryan keeps calling Michelle now.  Ryan, listen, she's married, all right?  So, back up.  A baby on the way.  Nice to meet you. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, little kid fell in love.  Little puppy love.  Like, fell in love with the reporter?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Old boy boobs.  I'm sure Bartlestein wants them.  Strattle that young chest.  By the sound of the boys, I'm thinking maybe they should have kept the boobs.  Yeah.  They were, uh, the voice was a little high there.  His name was Robert Paulson.  Speaking of boobs, well, you know, that's what we do.  Oh, king of the sick.  Can't believe I'm talking to a penthouse pet and I have a Breathe Right strip on my nose. 
[02:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  Zilch.  Yes, you do.  They're beautiful.  Thank you.  That's what they're supposed to be.  Well, we're not used to having hot women in the studio, let's be honest.  Yeah.  We've gotten a lot of messes lately.  Hey, they stopped doing, um, they stopped doing, like, they were doing hardcore for a while  on penthouse, having, like, did they stop doing that completely?  Having, like, things I can't describe?  No, no, I actually, I mean, they went hardcore for a while.  Water sports, they used to do.  Uh, old, yeah. 
[02:05:30]  A lot of ski stuff, yeah.  Yeah.  Things like that.  It definitely has changed a lot.  I mean, it's a different approach to the magazine.  Kind of classed it up a little bit.  A whole different style, yeah.  Yeah.  They're trying to be classier?  Trying to be classier.  Harry, uh, Giovanni, right?  Yes.  Very lovely.  I think it was hard for, uh, penthouse to compete with the internet for a while.  And they tried, like, topping it by going a little harder.  And, uh, you realize you can't top the internet.  Right. 
[02:06:00]  I love the hardcore on penthouse.  It was great.  Yeah, but they, they, you make a great point.  You can't be with the internet, so you gotta go another direction.  So you gotta find something else.  Maybe have better articles.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  Hotter girls.  Yeah, because we all know that you read the articles.  Occasionally.  On the bowl.  You know.  Yeah, on the toilet it's good reading because you can't get it, you don't want to, you know.  Yeah, you don't want to use it for what else you use it for.  So you kind of, you know, ooh, an article about cars.  This is nice.  At least penthouse, like, shows more. 
[02:06:30]  Penthouse is much sexier than Playboy.  It's just like, yeah, it's like a JCPenney catalog.  Yeah.  Stinks.  A little too, uh, clean.  Yeah, I mean, the girls are pretty, but I like a little filth in my filth.  So, uh, you're gonna do the walk with us today?  Uh, yes.  We gotta make it exciting for everybody somehow.  Oh, I know, it's raining.  Could you, uh, throw the tight white t-shirt on?  A tight white t-shirt over my dress?  Oh, that might not work.  If she is wearing a dress. 
[02:07:00]  Damn.  Do you have a gentleman friend?  Do I?  What do you mean?  Um.  You know, a guy that bangs you?  Boyfriend?  Something like that?  I'm single.  Oh.  Jimmy's, uh.  I'm not very good at asking gals out.  Jimmy's trying.  Would you go out with Jimmy?  Uh.  He's gonna be a big star.  His, uh, show on HBO starts Sunday.  We could go for a malted.  What do you think?  A malted.  Perhaps a yogurt.  How am I doing?  Awful.  All right. 
[02:07:30]  Would you, would you go out with Jimmy, really?  Wait, hold on.  No.  No, why?  He's taking his breather right off.  I almost took my breather right off.  I'm glad I left it on.  Why?  Why wouldn't you go out with him?  I'm married.  Oh.  Ah.  All right.  Accept that.  That's fair enough.  Nah, married is okay.  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll accept that.  All right.  I want to thank the, uh, Penthouse pet for stopping by today.  End of conversation.  This is going to go nowhere.  That's what she didn't want to have happen.  But she'll do the walk with us today.  Uh, you're in the latest issue of Penthouse? 
[02:08:00]  Yes, I'm on the cover.  Of, uh, what issue?  July 2006.  Oh, wow.  It's almost the month of July.  That's always good.  I thought, like, December 2006 was out on newsstands.  I don't really get how they do that.  She is really, really hot.  Yeah, you're very, very hot.  Thank you.  Extremely hot.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're going to continue Whip Him Out Wednesday exclusively for XM Satellite Radio.  We'll be broadcasting live from the lobby in just a couple minutes here.  And, uh, you'll be doing the walk with us?  Yes, yes.  Maybe we'll get something exciting going.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  But I say we don't.  We'll see.  We're good.  See you tomorrow, man.  Opie and Anthony!  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  What the hell is she going to do with that?  I have no idea.  She's right behind us.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Outside the Free FM studios here in New York City on this, uh, really rainy, rainy day.  Uh, we got a penthouse pet that's, uh, joining us for the walk today. 
[02:09:00]  She's in a very, very, very hot, black, short dress.  Um, our idea was to have her in a, uh, white beater, very tight, white, it's pouring, white  beater.  And we were going to have some kind of, like, really hot, wet t-shirt thing happening.  But, uh, I don't think she's into it.  So, this is going to be terrific.  The only thing that would have been hot.  I'm freezing.  It's cold out here.  It's cold and wet.  It sucks.  Uh, they also need somebody, uh, to, to help the penthouse pet to XM, Anthony. 
[02:09:30]  Uh, why?  You want Jimmy to hold your arm or anything?  What's the matter?  Does she know the way?  You're too far away.  Oh, here, here, take this.  All right, so, uh, Jimmy's going to escort, uh, what's her name again?  What's your name?  Aria Giovanni.  Oh, she's very, very hot.  Oh, it is just awful out here today, man.  Oh, fuck this. 
[02:10:00]  Get me a cab.  What?  This walk will really suck.  If one of these, uh, umbrellas hits me in the eye, we talk about this on our show all  the time.  Someone's going down.  You know, I'm, I'm getting wet and I'm such a faggot.  Lift up your umbrella.  There's other people walking, you know.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Oh, well, this is horrible.  Another exciting walk.  We got a very, uh, hot penthouse pet, but no one could really, uh, tell because they're  just all looking down at the sidewalk because it's miserable in New York. 
[02:10:30]  They're all covered with their umbrellas.  Just our luck.  God, we have 10 umbrellas and not one is over my head.  Thanks.  Hey, how about putting an umbrella over the star's head, please?  Thanks for the help today.  You're on me.  Here, no, I got nothing.  You take care of, uh, Anthony.  I'm soaking.  Just fuck it all.  We're all just miserable.  He picked a lovely day to come.  Yeah, why don't you talk to her, Jimmy?  See what's going on back there.  It's horrid.  Now, when you, when you came, did they, um, did they, did they say that they wanted to  put you in a white t-shirt?  Did anybody mention that to you? 
[02:11:00]  No, not until I got into the studio.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Is she going to do anything, Jimmy?  Just flat out ask her.  Uh, they, they want to know, and I want to know, um, are you going to be nude at all?  This stinks.  Well, am I going to be nude on the street?  No, no, no, no, no.  In the studio?  Yes.  Um, no.  Ah, no.  Holy shit.  For a few minutes, maybe?  That figures.  I can take my dress off.  Oh, okay.  And then what's under the dress, Jimmy?  For a lingerie.  What's under the dress? 
[02:11:30]  Um, just a lingerie bra panty.  Oh, God.  Leave her out in the rain.  No.  Just leave her out in the rain.  I'm sick of this shit.  Yesterday was the Omen girls.  Ugh.  Who did you talk, who, uh, no, I mean, she's lovely, and I have nothing against her.  But why else would she be on our show to talk politics?  Uh, we could give it a try.  I'm sure it'll suck ass.  Ask her her, uh, opinion on the Iran situation. 
[02:12:00]  Who cares?  Show us your boobs.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday, and you got a fine set of boobs.  That is true.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday on the show.  Did they tell you that?  It's what Wednesday?  You know, I'm so miserable.  Just let me walk in the rain.  I don't want an umbrella.  I want to get wet.  Well, that's our thing.  Like, girls show their breasts on Wednesday.  It's like the bumper sticker.  Oh, I see.  But I thought it, doesn't it go both ways?  Boring!  Whip It Out Wednesday?  Whip It Out Wednesday?  Whip It Out Wednesday?  No, we have pretty much a male audience, so nobody wants to see me. 
[02:12:30]  Whip Out a cock.  No, when you have a radio show, you can do Whip It Out Wednesday.  Oh, God.  This fucking sucks.  Opie and Anthony are very shy.  No, we're not.  We don't get many girls who will be naked in the studio.  We're not shy.  We've been doing this a long time.  We've had it.  It makes us feel very bad about ourselves.  Phil Donahue.  Mel Karmeson.  Mel Karmeson.  Phil Donahue.  Very good.  Anyone with white hair.  Moses.  All right.  Who's going to tell her that she can't come upstairs? 
[02:13:00]  They would like you to be nude in the studio because we have pal talk cams.  Not that you have to do anything pornographic.  Of course not.  They would like you to be nude in the studio.  I can take my dress off.  Oh, goodbye.  All right.  I'll be upstairs.  You guys can stay down here.  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites  to fight the forces of evil. 
[02:13:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my sweet cheese.  With Pop Pop.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  After.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like poorly spliced.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Ever Steve yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile in a Dexonix.  Palkitosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers. 
[02:14:00]  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:14:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, well.  I'm so glad E-Rock listened to me.  Holy crap.  But E-Rock can't do everything.  I am freezing and I'm soaked.  I punished myself.  Now I'm going to get the flu.  I was so annoyed.  I didn't want an umbrella.  I wanted to suffer.  Oh, what an idiot I am now. 
[02:16:30]  Now I'm completely soaked.  My friend is actually in this place.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  Talking to the XMers.  The XM Nation.  An FBA sweatshirt?  Yeah, sure.  I'm freezing.  Oh, let me get one.  You know, God, I can't do this anymore with the freaking girls and their...  Problem?  Yeah, it's just like... 
[02:17:00]  I mean, why else are you on a radio show?  I don't blame her.  I blame...  No one free-screened it.  No, no one free-screened.  But she seems like a lovely lady.  What are we going to do?  Talk about, you know, her interests?  By the way, remember I was in LA?  Likes and dislikes and favorite band and...  Remember I was in LA, I was talking to you, I was depressed that I wanted to go out with  this girl and she wouldn't date me?  Yeah, that's her.  Yeah.  Wow.  Another girl on the latest issue of Penthouse?  No, no, no.  She was on an older one.  Aiming a little high.  Please. 
[02:17:30]  If I aim above popular mechanics, I'm aiming high.  Oh, my God.  I'm a loser.  But yeah, that's...  No, but I want to find out...  Girls should have to be naked if they come in, unless they're doing something else specific.  Yeah.  But nobody on our end tells them this.  We even want Ann Coulter to be naked if she's on our show.  When was she booked?  Do we know?  Can we kind of backtrack, like reverse technology?  But you know what?  I just went to another place because I've heard that same conversation a million times. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Wait, you want me to do what?  Well, I'll...  Take your clothes off now.  Don't do that.  I'll keep my dress on.  Well, I'll take it off, but I got laundry on?  No.  Well...  Yeah, they usually don't.  Magazine girls.  Very, very rare.  I think I've seen it once in our careers.  Let's send her home. 
[02:18:30]  Are you annoyed, Anthony?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Why?  I'm not the guy that can do that.  No, I'm not saying that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm annoyed.  Please.  I'm annoyed also.  Someone help me out here.  But aren't you annoyed because it's like...  No, because it's expected.  I wanted to bring her in, and I'm like, no, we'll bring her in for the last two minutes because  we already know how this is going to end.  Yeah.  It's expected.  It's expected.  It's going to be all giggly and shy, and there's going to be...  You want me to do what?  I don't know.  I'm annoyed at our side because that should have been... 
[02:19:00]  Someone should have said...  No, no, no.  Someone should have said before, like, why won't you do that?  Like, why are we not doing that in advance?  Who's making these...  Like, who's booking these people and continually not saying anything?  Well, on paper, it sounded like a great idea.  Have a penthouse pet do the walk with us.  Unfortunately, it's a rainy day, so you can't really get...  You know, it's supposed to be 85 and sunny this time of year.  You think.  So it would make sense to get a girl in a really hot outfit, you know, high heels, a little  bit of clothes, and do the walk.  That alone would be interesting, yes.  Absolutely.  Yes, Ben? 
[02:19:30]  What?  What, Jim?  Oh, pussy.  What?  I didn't fucking say anything about you.  You did, too.  You're bitching and moaning.  Okay.  Why, Cindy?  Hang on.  Hold on.  I didn't mention...  I didn't say you booked her.  I said who booked her.  I didn't know if it was you or Steve.  I don't know who booked her.  I said why did anybody on our end talk to the girl?  I didn't mention you, so I'm not bitching.  You are bitching.  Are you the one that booked her?  Then I will ask you why didn't you talk to her in advance.  Jim, you know what?  Okay, I'm asking you came in, so I will ask you while you're here.  I don't bullshit and say little hidden things. 
[02:20:00]  You're a fucking pussy is what you are.  I'm a pussy?  You're a pussy.  Yeah, I show up every day and I do my fucking job.  You're a pussy.  How am I a pussy?  You're a pussy.  I'm not the one.  Because you saw the email about it, didn't fucking respond once in a while.  No, I didn't see the email.  So you don't know better?  You don't know that they're going to want her to get naked in the studio?  Or we're all going to want her to get naked in the studio?  How is that being a pussy on my part?  Sorry, Jim.  How?  No, I want to know how is that being a pussy?  Are your fucking teeth knocked out for your little fucking thing on Friday?  Why?  This close.  Yeah, are you?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Go ahead.  Do it.  Take your fucking best shot, Benny.  Jim. 
[02:20:30]  The producer of the radio show doesn't do a job and is threatening me?  Go ahead.  Do your best.  Take your best shot, Ben.  Whatever, Jim.  Whatever.  I'm not going to sit here and fight.  But, Jim, everyone saw the email.  You never read your email.  She was going to walk in a nice outfit on a nice day.  It's a rainy day.  Okay?  What?  Oh, boy. 
[02:21:00]  Keep it up.  Keep looking at me.  I'm looking right at you.  Keep looking at me.  Keep it up.  Keep it up.  I'm looking right at you.  Good.  Look at me.  So, that was the deal.  So, everyone saw the email.  So, if there can be a fight.  No, he's too easy.  Yeah, really?  Just do your job, man.  Do your job.  Okay, Jim.  Do your job, brother. 
[02:21:30]  All right, Jim.  Do your job.  Okay, keep pitching.  Do your job.  I will.  That's part of my job.  Yeah, it is.  Keep it up.  What the fuck does that mean, keep it up?  What does that mean?  Nothing.  I'm not even going to...  What does that mean?  No, just keep talking, Jim.  I am going to keep talking.  That's my job.  I do my job.  That's your job.  Yes.  Shut up.  Yes.  Everyone's sick of you.  Shut up.  I don't care who's sick of me.  Well, who?  I asked you for specifics.  You'd never give me specifics anyway. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, dude, this guy, that guy.  What?  What?  Who?  Well, if everyone else wanted to, you know, wanted to, you know, come in here and say it.  No, I'm asking you, man.  I don't fucking have to answer you anything.  You know what I'm saying?  You just talk vague shit, man.  You talk vague shit.  I'm specific and I'm honest.  Shut up.  No, you don't do your job, man.  You fucking complain.  I didn't do my job because...  I'm asking who booked her.  You came in here.  I said who booked her.  Guys on our side are not telling people what they need to tell them.  I didn't say, fuck Ben.  I don't know if you booked her or Steve booked her. 
[02:22:30]  I don't actually get booked here.  And you come in, you want to get your teeth knocked out?  Take a fucking swing.  Don't even tell me you're going to do it.  Just fucking swing.  God, I hate guys that talk shit like that.  I don't do that.  Oh, boy.  Don't even tell me you're going to do it.  I'm not going to do it.  Just if you're going to do it, don't even fucking warn me you're going to do it.  You don't want me to do it, number one.  I don't give a fuck, Ben, really.  Seriously.  You don't intimidate me.  In any way, shape, or form.  In any way, shape, or form.  What's the note Steve's holding up?  I'm asking if he still has the email he sent.  What does that have? 
[02:23:00]  Well, you...  Go ahead.  I was just asking Ben if he still had the email he sent out.  Serious.  Well, an email was sent out to everybody about what the penthouse pet was going to do, right?  Yeah, a long time ago.  Whatever.  And what did it say?  What was she going to do?  What did it say?  I don't fucking remember.  Then why did you ask if I read it when I'm asking you what it says and you don't know?  Because it sent out a million emails.  You never responded to any of them.  No, I don't.  For what?  Most of them are about what's saying.  And we talk about it.  What response to what?  What are they going to write?  Okay. 
[02:23:30]  I'll say it.  So what I want to know is who around here is sick of me.  I'm going to ask you for specifics.  You say things.  When I say things, I give specifics.  I'm honest.  I tell the truth.  I'm not going to let people talk for themselves.  Well, then you shouldn't have mentioned it.  All right.  I'm sick of you, Jim.  Okay.  And?  Opie's raising his hand.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  But, Ben, I'm asking you for specifics.  Jimmy, I love you.  I would never be sick of you.  If I say something, I back it up with honesty and specifics.  Seriously.  I might be yelling at you.  I back it up.  I don't talk. 
[02:24:00]  Just say.  Ben, one time I said something I was joking around about being rich, which I'm not.  And he goes to me, dude, stop with the rich jokes.  It's bothering people at XM.  It bothers our staff here.  If you really want to get into it.  Oh, yeah.  I would love to get into it.  Who?  Everyone.  Go around.  Ask the peasants.  It so bothers you.  That type of humor.  It bothers everyone.  So, Andrea.  Okay.  Is this on?  Yes, it is.  I think when you drill the millionaire thing home, even if you're joking, I think what it  does is it alienates people.  Really? 
[02:24:30]  Well, fuck those people.  They don't mind Andrea Yates murdering her children jokes.  But I'm not even a millionaire, and I joke sarcastically about that.  And that alienates people?  Not an isolated incident.  Steve, you guys are way off, baby.  Fuck you.  I do age jokes.  That doesn't alienate people.  Get the fuck out of here.  Now, man, you guys got to relax.  That is such an obvious joke when Jimmy does that shit.  I understand it's a joke.  Then you don't understand it.  If there was any hint of seriousness to that, then you guys would have a point.  But to say that it's alienating people when it's obviously an over-the-top joke. 
[02:25:00]  I understand it's a joke.  Holy crap.  Really?  Then you don't understand if it's a joke if it bothers you.  No, you don't.  Alienates people?  How?  Honestly, that's ridiculous.  That's like not getting the show, because that is so obvious that we're joking.  That's bad, dude.  That is really bad.  It's embarrassingly bad.  I've got to be honest.  That's really bad.  Embarrassingly bad.  I'm not embarrassed to say it in there.  You never said it to me before.  You only said it when you were called out on it.  If there was any honesty or truth to the comments, but it's so obvious it's over-the-top talking 
[02:25:30]  about we're divas and millionaires and all that crap.  Every single person in this room is underpaid if we really want to get into it.  I understand that.  I understand that.  And we're doing the best we can to get people more money.  Trust me on that.  Look, I'm all about telling people things to their faces.  Whoever else on the staff doesn't like it, I would love to hear it.  I would love to, honest to God, any dumb motherfucker that... 
[02:26:00]  I've never made a half a million dollars in my life in a year.  Ever.  No one's accusing you of rubbing it in somebody's face.  Then what's the point?  I understand.  No, I think...  Of course you are.  That's exactly what you're saying.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not at all what I said.  I think the joke translates poorly sometimes.  Really?  God, you're so off, Steve.  I got to tell you, you're so off.  But you have the balls to say to me, you guys have like a little fucking...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Did Ben read your mind?  What?  Did Ben read your mind?  No, then how else does he know it? 
[02:26:30]  Is it something that we've talked about before?  Like...  Yeah, I just said that.  It was some little kvetching thing you guys did.  Not kvetching.  We're not a couple of gossiping fucking hens, Jim.  Of course you are.  No, we're not.  Of course you are.  He threw you under the bus because it got blurred out.  I didn't throw you under the bus.  Not by name, but just like, dude, people don't like that.  Steve at least came in here and said...  What are you talking about?  How could you not like...  Oh, my God.  The irony.  You could fucking cut the irony.  Holy shit.  Holy shit. 
[02:27:00]  Holy shit.  You can't take that stuff personally, guys.  That's bad.  That really is bad.  Holy shit.  Especially knowing...  It rubs people the wrong way.  That's ridiculous.  I don't give a fuck who it rubs the wrong way.  Ever.  I understand you don't give a fuck, but I'm not allowed to say that it might.  Why would it?  When you do fucking woman-beating promos, it don't rub me the wrong way.  Holy shit.  I understand that.  Holy shit.  I'm not on a fucking pedestal.  I'm not standing on a fucking pedestal looking down at you.  Oh, God. 
[02:27:30]  Dude, don't.  Don't.  You honestly think I'm being condescending when I say that?  No, I think you're being completely inconsistent and getting...  I can't even comprehend how that would rub somebody...  I can't comprehend it.  I don't know.  It can be inconsistent to you.  Do I make more than you?  Yeah.  Yeah, you probably do.  I probably should.  No disrespect to you.  At all.  Do I make as much as them?  No.  And I probably shouldn't.  I understand that.  No disrespect to me.  I understand that.  All right.  So then how would that rub anybody the wrong way? 
[02:28:00]  You should be making more than you do, Jimmy.  But do you understand what I'm saying, though?  It's like I would never...  Oak jokes about that or ant jokes about that.  I live in my mansion.  Do you think I would ever...  What?  What do you have a better mansion than me?  No, no.  I don't think anybody's accusing you.  And I'm certainly not accusing you of saying it genuinely.  Then how...  If it's not said genuinely?  Then you shouldn't have a problem.  How could it ever...  Then you shouldn't have a problem, Steve.  To say I don't think a joke is funny because the joke quality is bad, that I'd never have  a problem with.  But that's not what this is about.  If there's a hint of seriousness to what Jimmy says, then you might have a point. 
[02:28:30]  But it's obviously...  I know there's no serious.  And I understand it's sarcasm.  I get it.  I think...  It can't rub you the wrong way.  Then how does it rub you the wrong way?  You're working for the wrong show if that stuff rubs you the wrong way.  No, you're not.  I'm having a difficult time conveying the actual point.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, thank you.  I'm having a difficult time actually conveying the point.  I think when you...  I honestly think the joke, it alienates people.  Not necessarily myself.  Maybe, you know...  I just think when it gets repeated to people that...  Especially an audience full of people that might not be... 
[02:29:00]  Can somebody please just speak their mind honestly?  You made promos out of it.  What?  No, I didn't.  Can somebody just...  Are they making fun of the millionaire thing?  Absolutely.  I have.  ...speak their mind honestly.  If it's bothering you, say it's bothering you.  See, you obviously were annoyed at me for something.  Because you walked in here.  When I had...  I said, why is nobody on our end asking girls these things?  Because they're not mind readers.  They come in to do this.  So it's our responsibility as a show to do that.  Why is that not behind the scenes? 
[02:29:30]  And he comes in genuinely mad.  And I don't care if you're genuinely mad.  I don't care.  I wasn't actually specifically talking to you.  If I believed you, if I was, I would have said Ben.  But don't come in here and threaten...  Dude, really.  That annoys me.  I don't care if you're mad at me.  But don't fucking play a hard guy.  If you're going to make a move, just fucking make the move.  Then don't say it, dude.  Then don't say it.  That really bugs me.  You can yell at me, criticize me, all that shit.  But don't fucking go there.  Because that's not who you are.  Stop.  Well, no, Jim.  But the problem is, is if you would...  You know, when we send these emails out, then just respond.  But, well, how would I respond to that?  If that's what she's going to do... 
[02:30:00]  You know.  Okay.  That's all I'm trying to do.  That was what I came in here.  I said...  But if you know that everyone's going to...  But why?  Tell the truth.  It shouldn't get out of control.  Be honest, man.  If there's a problem like that, then be honest.  You don't like the fact that I tease you for all this shit?  I know you don't, but too bad.  No, no, no.  I live under the bus.  I'll throw you under, I'll throw...  I live under the bus.  No, but...  I'm just saying that, you know...  We all get our shot under the bus.  But that's why I'll shit on you, and I'll shit on you.  And I know sometimes I annoy you guys.  I don't give a fuck.  Because I tell the truth about myself.  The awful truth sometimes.  So if I tease my friends, sorry. 
[02:30:30]  We've got to fill a lot of content.  You guys understand that.  You're a character.  You're a character.  Why shouldn't we all be characters?  He's a sociopath and a fucking character.  His whole fucking Nazi germaphobe.  We all have to do that.  So I'm saying...  No, and I don't think anybody's debating that.  Who's a sociopath?  You.  You know, I pointed an ant.  Oh, all right.  I want to make sure.  Not you.  No, no, no.  I think he is.  But I thought...  Fucking Jimmy, he could even...  But I...  Make people laugh under the uncomfortable situation.  But I'm honest to God, I'm not uncomfortable with it. 
[02:31:00]  Because if like...  If something rubs you the wrong way...  If you came in here...  If Ben came in here to me one day and said the child rape star...  Or whatever it is...  Rubs me the wrong way.  That I would understand, even though I wouldn't agree with it.  Because that's a brutal subject.  But something like that...  Yeah, Steve, I got to...  And Ben...  You guys picked the wrong thing.  Because that...  And other people...  I don't even see it.  I understand it's a joke.  I get it's a joke.  But I think...  You know...  Is it in some way rooted in frustration?  I think so. 
[02:31:30]  It's just...  In what?  I...  When you joke about being a millionaire...  You know...  Isn't that joke rooted in some kind of sarcasm?  No, I understand it.  Isn't that rooted in some kind of sarcasm?  Like, maybe I wish I should be making more?  I think...  Let's see...  And what it really...  It's...  There's been so much bullshit that's happened...  And why...  I'm not trying to attack you on this.  Why it's annoying...  Attack.  No, no, no.  Why it's annoying is just because there's a lot of stuff that's going on behind the scenes  for our whole staff as far as money not going through, them not getting stuff.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[02:32:00]  Right.  And it's just an upsetting subject.  Well, you know what?  I got a raise...  But...  And I have...  Well, five months ago, and I haven't seen a penny of it.  I'm not...  And I know I'll get it.  I'm not...  Whatever.  But I have the same issues.  I have the same issues.  And I would joke about that regardless of what I'm making.  Why?  Because it sounds obnoxious.  And the listeners know I'm kidding.  And if you don't know I'm kidding and you're a listener, you're a dumb motherfucker.  They know.  I've never gotten one email from a listener. 
[02:32:30]  And I've gotten emails about every subject we've touched that have said,  Dude, why are you bragging about making money?  They get it.  Now, you see feedbacks every once in a while.  Okay.  Well, I don't get the emails.  Well, fuck the feedback.  Who cares?  I don't get emails about it.  You know, come on.  I cannot comprehend.  I cannot comprehend.  I, honest to God, cannot comprehend how that could rub anybody the wrong way.  Well, it's...  It does.  It does.  And there's a lot of people, you know,  I know a lot of people are going to come in here and say it.  Well, then people should shut their mouths  and either have the moral courage to tell the truth and just be honest. 
[02:33:00]  I can't fire anybody and I wouldn't want to over that.  I mean, you know, I have no power to do that.  So why wouldn't anybody tell me the truth?  Why?  And then stop blah, blah, blah about it.  Just fucking say it.  Then you're working for the wrong show, man.  Because, I mean, if we were walking around when these mics were off bragging about being millionaires,  then you guys might be on to something.  You guys are way off base, I gotta say it.  And I really wish that it was, believe me, I wish it was fucking rooted in truth. 
[02:33:30]  I really do.  But it's not.  And it's so over the top.  All right, then I'm off.  By the way, I hate to break the fourth wall, but before I really...  I don't know all this one, actually.  That was the fourth.  This is the fifth.  I really didn't want to kiss Opie on the mouth before when I said it.  Oh, you didn't?  No, but I'm saying, like, now I guess we should go over everything.  And that bothers me personally, because I was hoping for a good one.  Yeah, who wouldn't?  And I'm really not, like, you know, into a lot of the things I talk about.  It's just to be silly. 
[02:34:00]  Do you see?  So why is it...  I just...  I can't comprehend it, man.  Rick from Rhode Island.  And Benjamin pissed off at me for a few days, and he was...  When you came in and choked me, like, I knew you were kind of...  If I believe me, I didn't take it as being truly aggressive.  But now I look back on it, it's like, you were really mad.  So if you don't...  Again, as a man, if you have a problem with me, sit down and tell me.  Don't fucking harbor that little aggression, because it doesn't frighten me, it doesn't  intimidate me, and it's not the way I do things.  So I don't threaten people with violence.  If you ever have violence for me, don't even fucking tell me you're going to do it. 
[02:34:30]  I mean that sincerely.  You don't frighten me.  I'll never just fucking put violence on you.  But if you want to do that, don't tell me you're going to do it.  Just fucking do it.  I don't want to hear it.  Don't threaten me like that.  That really hits a weird place in me, and I fucking hate it.  Just don't do it.  I don't do it to you.  Don't do it to me.  So what are we going to do with this girl?  Rick from Rhode Island says this is going to take a whole box of terror.  Tender sentiment.  Wow.  Everyone's requesting karma chameleon. 
[02:35:00]  This is...  I don't think that's going to work.  Nah, that threatening shit, man, it hits a really weird place to me.  And I don't do it to people.  It's not like I walk around doing it to people.  That fucking...  Women.  You threaten them with them.  Yeah, there's just really very few things that hit me like that, and that just really  fucking makes me angry.  And I don't do it to people.  So I don't like it when it's done to me.  I don't respond well to it.  So what is everyone trying to say here today?  Ben?  Last words. 
[02:35:30]  You want Jimmy to read more emails or respond to stuff?  Like, what's...  No, I'm serious.  I do.  I do.  I read a lot of the emails.  A lot of the things have nothing to do with me in a weird way.  Like, there's really...  Like, you guys are making decisions.  I'm cool with the decisions.  I don't...  I'm not criticizing.  Well, we...  Fine.  The girl came in.  I was glad she came in.  It's okay.  But she's not a mind reader.  So what I'm saying is if we want her to do this and be naked in the studio, why was she  not told beforehand she has to be naked in the studio?  They'll never have them.  And Ben, I guess, is saying maybe we say that in email before she gets in. 
[02:36:00]  And I'm saying, was it?  And if he would have come in and said, Jim, we emailed her and he said that.  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Then let's get her in here and fucking see what happened.  See, it's called stop no bullshitting and buck passing.  Let's find out what happened.  I don't know, I guess because the way I do my thing is when my joke bombs and I fuck  up, it's there.  Everyone knows it.  When they tell something that bombs, everyone knows it.  It's immediate and happens.  Behind the scenes shit, you have to go over step by step.  By the way, I never know because I'm very self-absorbed.  Absolutely.  And it never happens with your stuff, so you don't recognize it. 
[02:36:30]  That's understandable, right?  Well.  Hmm.  So what happened with this girl?  I don't know.  I didn't, I understand exactly what you've been saying.  I don't know who booked her.  I didn't.  She was just going to walk down the street with the, it was just the thing for the walk.  They were just trying to get her on the air for the walk.  Yeah.  I had a conversation with Ben.  It was going to be like, get her in the last minute or two on CBS.  And then she was going to do a walk in a really hot outfit.  But she's not even in a hot outfit. 
[02:37:00]  She's in a black dress that's kind of hot.  Like, she looks like almost any other business girl going to work in this area.  Let me give you an example.  Like the Fox thing the other day, a lot of the shit that they promised, you know, they  were going to give out movie passes to the Omen.  They were going to give out t-shirts.  Or the guy shows up with no, you know, the girls don't even.  I don't fault you on that.  But I've been saying a lot of times with what's saying.  I've been brutally honest with you and everybody else that works for the show.  I don't fault you for that, Ben.  But nobody did.  Nobody even thought of you yesterday.  Ben, there are times where, there are a lot of times we are on your side.  I mean, Ben feels a lot of pressure, you know, producing this show. 
[02:37:30]  The girls from the Omen yesterday was a complete disaster, a complete joke.  And then people point at Ben like, you know, you should have made this happen.  It looks good.  I mean, you know, a lot of times.  So I don't blame you for that.  I mean, they never get naked.  I mean, we know that.  Someone was saying, if Ben wanted to see Jimmy's hat, all he had to do was ask.  The listeners coming through with the comedy.  Oh, they forget nothing.  Anyway. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, and people wanted, holy shit, from me.  You see spaghetti all over the walls.  Oh, I just see the spaghetti kind of just crawling down the wall.  I run from these circumstances.  I run.  Jimmy, just so you know, we will have girls doing exactly what you described in studio next week.  See, that's not my issue.  Wait, next week?  What's that about?  Sunset.  That's not my issue.  Sunset's a player.  She'll do it.  That's not my issue.  I don't care if she's naked or not.  Steve keeps pushing the girls.  No, I really haven't. 
[02:38:30]  You really do.  Oh, no, no, no.  And I keep going.  Why?  I save all the emails.  Why do we continue to go down this road?  I push one.  We can't get it going anymore for some reason.  Out of every 20 pitches I get, maybe goes across the bow, and that's it.  And I always preface it, should I pass on this, or do we not want it?  Well, but there are times, though, and as much as Steve is, I'm irritated with him right now.  We do at times say, look, we need girls in here.  We have no sex on this show.  I mean, it's like there's a weird balance, and he's the guy that's got to do that. 
[02:39:00]  So, I mean, if they're not going to come through, then we have to know that in advance.  But, I mean, we do kind of say we need chicks, so, I mean, sometimes we've got to have them.  But if they're not going to do anything, I don't want to attack the girl if she really didn't know.  I'm not attacking her.  No, no, I'm not saying you did.  I'm saying, because it makes me angry when it doesn't happen.  But I'm done with her.  We've got to do a radio show.  Okay, fair enough.  This isn't our, uh...  Good luck.  Good luck?  Good luck getting into a radio show.  Why, good luck?  I feel like it's a little tension.  Who said good luck?  I get nervous when people fight.  You said good luck?  Yeah, I say good luck doing a show. 
[02:39:30]  And we got Mike Cuban at 10 o'clock at all.  I get nervous.  I know.  So what are we going to do with the broad?  I think we're going to have to do that.  Let's make E-Rock Center home.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, fucking E-Rock.  Let's all come together by making fun of E-Rock's hair.  Yeah, why not?  I don't want to, man.  I've been rubbing people the wrong way.  You know, a lot of people are sensitive about haircuts.  Oh, boy.  I know I'm losing a little, so...  I want to know who's, uh...  I try to smile through all the hair jokes myself.  I want to know who else is, uh...  Oh, dude, I'm dying to know. 
[02:40:00]  But nobody...  It's like...  Nobody just fucking says what's on their mind like that.  I guess that's the one thing about being on air.  We just did.  You did.  You just ripped us to shreds for saying.  Is it Derek?  Is it Travis?  Ripping us to shreds.  Yes, but you said it.  I didn't tell you that you couldn't say it.  You know what I noticed about the other room?  It's a lot darker in there.  They turn the lights off.  And they lean way far back so they can't see them.  So we can't even read their expressions.  Because they're going, yeah, motherfucker.  Am I the only one?  Look how dark that room is today.  You can't read crap.  And Ben, you did say it, but only under duress. 
[02:40:30]  You said it to me that one day, but then I asked...  I said it to you off the air.  I said it to you off the air.  And then you bring it up on the air.  You don't...  Yes, it's honest.  You never want to talk about stuff off the air.  You're always...  I...  You bring everything.  You have to bring...  No, no, hang on.  Don't get mad.  But you always want to bring stuff up on the air.  That wasn't mad.  That was exasperation.  You decide...  You're like, well, let's talk about it on the air.  You know, that's fine.  I know, it's silly.  I mean, on a talk show.  But I mean...  But I know off the air, I did ask you, who said this?  Like, I...  Because you say...  Hold on, bro.  You say things in these weird vagaries.  Like, you said XM. 
[02:41:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Well, have there been several people that have brought this up in this organization?  Yeah, in the past.  Okay.  But I'm not going to say...  Well, whoever they are, if they're listening, a fuck you, and a fuck you, and a fuck you,  and a eat shit, and fucking go to another show, and a fuck you, and a you, and a you, and a you.  Not if you don't think a joke is funny, but if that rubs you the wrong way on the level  that everybody listening knows these two are talking about, if that bothers you because  of what they think it represents, then I don't know how to respond to that. 
[02:41:30]  I am...  I am fucking clueless as to how to respond to that.  I gotta agree with you there, Mikey.  Whew.  And everyone here has the opportunity to go find more money, too.  Yeah.  And look, whoever, other people who want to come in and say something...  If you're that bummed about the money, you know, see what you're worth on the open market.  No problem.  Oh.  You can come in here and say it.  You're not going to be fired.  You're not going to... 
[02:42:00]  No one's going to, you know...  And then that's what happens.  They won't.  You come back and go, hey, blah, blah's offering me this much, and then, you know,  then we sit down and decide if you're worth that much.  That's how it works.  Done the show for a really long time with a lot of different people.  I'm not going to play the money crap with people.  If you don't...  If you're not happy with the money you're making, you know, no one's keeping you here.  Go find more money somewhere else.  Deal or no deal.  Go ahead.  Jeez.  That's how it works. 
[02:42:30]  That's how I got raises over the years.  I was unappreciative.  They were unappreciative of what I was doing, so I'm like, all right, I'm leaving.  And guess what?  All of a sudden, I got a huge raise.  Then you realize what you're really worth.  So go ahead.  People are that miserable about what they're making around here.  Can't believe Ben was going to punch your teeth out.  I'm not...  Here's my thing.  I'm not a tough guy, man.  I don't ever...  I don't behave that way towards people.  I really don't.  And you guys know me well enough to know that I've been enraged.  It's just not the way I interact with people.  But when somebody does that to me, it hits a very... 
[02:43:00]  A really weird place with me.  And I can't tell you how fucking angry that makes me.  Want to have a drink?  No, but I want to kind of...  Maybe.  A couple of men.  Get someone to dress.  I got to be honest.  In a sick way, I want to see a fight.  I want to see...  Oh, no.  I want to see both...  No, not that.  I want to see their fighting styles.  No.  No.  I really did.  I want to see what kind of action Jimmy has.  And Ben, what's up, Ben?  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  I don't...  I'm obviously was a little enraged with you because I'm usually not like that. 
[02:43:30]  I mean, how often...  Yeah, but you were like...  All the years...  Wait a second.  Ben's been...  Helps know me better than anyone and longer than anyone.  I don't get that mad at all.  I'm pretty fucking mental.  Well, then you need to focus your anger in the proper place.  All right, Ben.  All right, then I ask you, what is this really about?  Well, no, it's just generally...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You know...  Because you obviously have a lot of frustration that's building up in you.  What is this really about?  No, no, no.  What's it about?  No, that right there when he...  But that was like, obviously, the last straw because it wasn't that bad. 
[02:44:00]  Of course.  We were frustrated because we were in another situation with a hot girl that wasn't going  to do anything.  So, just like every other time, like, all right, who booked this and what was promised?  That's all.  It wasn't that bad, to be honest with you.  A little confrontational.  Yeah, possibly.  But you really lost it.  So, what's going on?  And if you had just come in and said to me, dude, what the fuck...  I never would have yelled at you like that.  But you came in here...  E-Rock takes more abuse on a daily basis than that little exchange that you guys had.  So, I'm thinking there's got to be something else going on.  I think Ben is bothered by a lot of the shit I say.  I think he's annoyed at a lot of the references I make. 
[02:44:30]  Even though he knows where they're coming from, he knows I like him.  He's bothered by a lot of that stuff.  I flew off the handle, Jim.  I wouldn't...  When I knock your teeth out as a fucking...  As a silly expression, I would never do that.  And even the other day when I...  You know...  I wasn't...  Strangled him.  I would never...  No, I saw it.  No, I didn't take that.  I saw it.  I didn't take that as being aggressive.  No, no.  I didn't take that as being aggressive.  I was only kidding.  But whatever it's about, I think it's way more... 
[02:45:00]  I think it's the things I say, and I'm sure that Steve doesn't like them.  It was just like...  I'm sitting in there, you know, you're just saying about the girl.  It's just...  A lot of times...  You know...  I don't know.  I'll tell you what's doing it.  Look out that fucking window.  We're in a weather fucking rage.  The expression, and I...  And you...  I would...  I'm not that...  I said that as an expression.  No wonder people kill themselves in Seattle.  Like, every day, people just killing themselves.  I was just aggravated just now.  Fucking rain.  It's making everyone depressed and angry. 
[02:45:30]  It's seven.  You look out the window...  It's the movie seven.  Fucking...  Where's the sunshine?  If it was sunny for that walkover, we all would have gotten our little dose of sunshine.  We get a little through Jimmy, but we need sunshine from the actual sun.  Barely a hint of sunshine from Jimmy.  I mean, my arms are awesome.  Mostly, it's cloudy over there.  Very cloudy.  With threatening skies.  No.  He lifts up his mattress.  Counts his money.  You got city hens, Mr. Hooper.  I'm counting money all your life. 
[02:46:00]  Tie me a sheep shank.  And you know now this show is all about money, right?  So you might as well get all the money songs and everything else, because it's all about money today.  Money, money, money, money.  Money, money, money!  Anything tad, Steve?  No, that's about it.  Record me some production.  I didn't think I'd have to pass basic production work today.  And there goes Steve. 
[02:46:30]  Walking out uncomfortably.  Everybody walked out a little uncomfortably.  And here comes E-Rock to save the day.  Who knew that E-Rock would be a welcome sight today, I guess?  Thank God for E-Rock.  We love the E-Rock.  E-Rock, tell the girl to go home.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Or should we bring her in?  What do you want to do?  The problem causer?  What are we going to talk to her about?  Huh?  I'll tell her, don't.  Do you want to just see what there is there? 
[02:47:00]  Because everybody hears us go, nothing ever happens, nothing ever they don't do.  All right.  But then we never really show what it's all about.  Are you hearing phones in the background?  Yeah.  Hearing voices?  It's Ben calling monster.com or Kinko's.  Wow.  Oh, man.  I mean, over the years of my career when I was unhappy about money, I took it upon myself  to go find more money.  I mean, no offense to these guys. 
[02:47:30]  It was your bank robbing phase.  I remember that.  No offense to these guys.  Well, that's just how it works in our country.  In any business you're in.  Any business.  I've, trust me, I've gotten these guys more money.  Obviously, it's not enough for these guys, and there's other things in the work.  But if you're not happy with money, holy crap.  What, do you just sit around and wait for someone to throw a bag of money on your desk,  or do you go out and see if you're worth more somewhere else?  It's what I do.  Just wait for a bag of money to drop in every month. 
[02:48:00]  It's there.  Ooh.  I'd like a bag of money.  Am I upsetting somebody?  No.  I have so much money.  Give me hope.  I have so much money in my apartment.  I got checks laying around everywhere.  I can't be bothered to go to the bank and wait online.  This is an uncashed check for $50,000.  I just keep it.  I got them all over the apartment.  I'll be honest.  Like Ty Webb.  I'll be honest.  I'm using the uncashed checks to plug up the rat hole. 
[02:48:30]  The rat hole?  Is that what you do?  You just plug it up with uncashed checks?  Now, now, he's getting very angry.  Your pillow's not fluffy enough?  Stuff a few hundred minutes.  That's right.  Fluff it up hundreds.  It makes it puffier.  Now this show is going to be all about money today.  I ran out of toilet paper two weeks ago, and I didn't even notice because I had stacks of bills lying around.  You just use hundreds.  I laugh.  Anyone in that room honest enough to hold up your hand if you're upset by any of that joking? 
[02:49:00]  Do any hands go up?  I'm looking at Stan and I'm looking at Derek.  I can't see those guys really being.  I'm looking at the girl that's in there with them.  That is just so off base.  That one is so off base.  Sometimes, you know, you get a taste of reality, but that is just so off base.  That was rough.  All right.  Let's bring in this young lady. 
[02:49:30]  This young lady.  How are you?  Penthouse pet.  Aria Giovanni.  I bet she starts a lot of fights.  Here she is.  Look how sweet.  Hi, Aria.  And everything.  Hi.  You've caused a lot of problems today.  Oh, I have?  Yeah.  Was the audio on out there?  No, I missed it.  I think that was on purpose.  Were you able to read lips through the glass?  That was funny.  I just knew that someone was in trouble.  Wait, did you see the argument that was going on through the glass? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, of course I did.  You want to know what the argument was about?  Uh-oh.  Jimmy said that your breasts are real and Ben said they're implants.  And they got into a whole discussion about it.  Yep.  Because Jimmy really likes natural boobs and Ben likes the implants.  Implants.  They look like implants, really?  I think they look very real.  Jimmy says they're real.  Yeah.  Well, look, implants don't lay like that.  Right.  That's what I was trying to say.  But he's saying no, because there's no way that they're that part.  It was the whole thing.  And he said he felt them and they felt like hard. 
[02:50:30]  And I'm like, dude, there's no way you felt them.  Did you feel happy that there was a huge argument over you?  Who felt them?  Ben, the producer.  He said he kind of felt them.  He said that was part of you getting on the show.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a big lie.  He also was upset about how much money you probably made doing that layout.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he probably made a lot of money and he was upset about that whole thing.  Yeah.  But you know, you did your job, right?  Yeah, it's my job.  You earned it.  It's my job.  You earned your keep.  So we want to ask you, what's your likes?  My likes.  Yeah.  Like, what do I like to do?  Yeah.  You know, if you had to answer, my likes are, what would you list? 
[02:51:00]  I love food and wine.  Food and wine.  Yeah, I love to eat.  I love to cook.  You must work it off.  Yeah.  Go to the gym, do you?  Yeah.  I run on the treadmill.  What does your husband do?  He's a musician.  In what band?  Rob Zombie.  He's Rob Zombie?  No, he's in Rob Zombie.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Like, we're going to get our ass kicked.  There's some tough guys in Rob Zombie's band.  He plays lead guitar for Rob Zombie. 
[02:51:30]  What's his name?  John Five.  Oh, sure.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Now we can talk about something.  Yeah.  Could you get me to see Zombie?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Zombie's good.  Yeah.  He's actually working on a movie with Tom Papa.  Really?  Oh, the biggest nerd in comedy and fucking Rob Zombie are doing a cartoon together.  It really hurts.  Really?  I'm so jealous of that friendship.  It makes me sick.  I think John wrote some of the music for that cartoon.  Oh?  Oh, you know who Tom is?  No, but I've heard about the cartoon and John was in the studio working on it. 
[02:52:00]  What's some of your dislikes?  Very tough question, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are the girls not like?  Dislikes.  It's funny if she said Jews.  Besides the obvious, because, you know, you know what we all don't like.  I guess if you're talking about in a man, what I don't like?  Dislikes in general, sure.  You know, like sour milk.  Arrogance?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like a cocky guy. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah?  No, it's not a cocky guy.  Well, then you wouldn't like Ben Sparks.  He's pretty cocky and ballsy.  He's got one big ball or one really tremendous hog.  Women like me because I'm shy.  Teehee.  Wouldn't it be ironic if it was a big bag of money in Ben's pants?  You'd call him out as a hypocrite.  And he can't spend it because he's really hung like an acorn and he needs the money to make himself look big in his pants.  Wow.  How ironic would that have been, right? 
[02:53:00]  Do I buy something nice or let everyone think I have a huge hog?  Do you do dirty films?  I shoot softcore.  I don't shoot hardcore.  It's a hotel kind of video.  Who's the guy in L.A. that shoots all those?  He's like a really, the Valentina shoots for him?  Andrew Blake.  I've shot six of his films.  Terrific.  Any other dislikes?  Cocky?  Arrogance?  Ignorance?  Ignorance.  That rhymes with arrogance.  Yeah.  I'm just going to make a poem. 
[02:53:30]  Hawks out.  You're attracted to our own Eric.  He thinks, those are not even prescription glasses.  He just wears them because he thinks it makes him look endearing and smart.  All right.  We got a question.  We have a question for you.  Uh-oh.  Because we had a whole discussion about your boobs.  Okay.  Whether they were real or implants, right?  Yeah.  They're real.  Look at Iraq.  Is that hair real or fake?  Real?  It looks real to you.  Take your headphones off.  She's only seen a part of it.  Yeah.  Real or fake?  Well, I think it's real. 
[02:54:00]  Oh.  It doesn't look like plugs?  No.  Oh, that failed miserably.  All right.  It's all right.  We all knew what you meant, and we all agreed with you.  She's just too nice to say it.  His hair is a fucking visual disaster and an embarrassment.  It looks like Sideshow Bob before he's actually growing.  You'd look better with a cock on your head, Eric.  No offense.  How does that make sense?  Because how silly is a cock on your head?  Exactly.  I've seen it.  Come on, Jimmy.  Come over here and let's show everybody how silly it was.  A couple of men getting some laughs. 
[02:54:30]  Cock on one of our heads.  All right.  What else can we do with you there?  Because we wanted you to be nude, and that was, you know, we just get shy.  See, we were silly thinking that since girls, and this isn't just you, mind you.  Yes.  Nothing personal.  No, I know.  But we are usually under the impression that penthouse girls, since they're naked in the  magazine, and I know you get paid for that and everything like that, that they wouldn't  have a problem taking their clothes off in front of just a few guys. 
[02:55:00]  Just to look.  No touching, nothing like that.  So we're surprised every time that we're turned down.  And I do mean every time.  Every time.  That we're turned down, yeah.  The problem is broads are getting too classy these days.  Oh, that's a big problem.  The likes of you calling them broads, perhaps, that's a problem.  Strippers and centerfold models and the like, they're all getting too classy.  You're lumping them all into one category.  Have you ever stripped?  What happened to the skank factor?  Never danced?  Never danced.  Yeah, see?  So that's some different category.  No.  You went from what to modeling? 
[02:55:30]  I was a full-time student.  Full-time student.  Yeah.  Going for what?  Biochemistry.  Biochemistry.  And what happened?  You got done with that?  And there weren't many biochemistry jobs out there?  No.  No.  The same month I got accepted to UCSD as a junior transfer student, I got into Penthouse.  Did you try to put test tubes under your boobs to see if you could hold them?  No.  Say that's what I think is going on in the lab.  No.  No.  No, I was a full-time student. 
[02:56:00]  I was going to go on to get my doctorate.  Boring.  And I guess she found that same thing.  Yeah.  Boring and decided to hit the exciting life.  No, I needed money to pay for college.  Really?  And so I started modeling and then it took off.  And I really...  So you started making a lot of money?  I made a lot of money.  Ben is going to come in here and punch your teeth out.  If you even talk about making money.  Don't tell Ben how much money you're making.  Well, sometimes I just don't think it rubs people the wrong way. 
[02:56:30]  I just...  You know, it's...  Sorry, woman murder promo guy.  Apologize.  Didn't mean to hit your sensitive spot.  You know, it's just a thing.  We just, you know, we talk about it all the way from Boston to New York.  And then we smile at you when we see you.  Oh!  All right.  Even though you go back for me all the time, I understand that.  That's insinuating that there's phoniness going on.  I got hours of phone calls today.  I turn my phone off now.  I pull an opie now.  I just turn my phone off. 
[02:57:00]  I turn my phone back on.  You ever do that?  You just get too many calls.  You don't care.  You just, boom, turn it off.  No, I put it on vibrate.  Ooh.  If you didn't have a husband...  Yes.  See, I'm very insecure about my chin.  Like, from the...  Like, is it possible?  Maybe you're dumb.  You know, if you don't get naked, Jimmy's going to get naked.  Okay.  You want to show her your ass?  Come on.  Would you like to see Jimmy's ass?  No, he can get naked.  I can't.  Well, he's...  I would think...  I would get yelled at by XM because I'm an employee. 
[02:57:30]  That's going to stop you before.  See?  I know that.  She goes back to the penthouse girls and goes, these fucking radio guys never get naked.  They sit there with their hot cocks.  Yeah.  Always talking.  Wait, wait, wait.  We've got to get this on Pal Talk.  Jimmy's got a nice ass.  I'm shy.  Jimmy's ass is like a nine-year-old boy.  We need a female's opinion on Jimmy's ass.  Okay.  If my computer was here, I'd show you.  All right.  Here we go.  A Filipino boy.  Not an Asian.  Right. 
[02:58:00]  I don't know what happened to the Opie and Anthony show.  Now we've got guys naked instead of girls.  Huh?  Notice how I leave the belt to plump it up a little bit?  Yeah.  I noticed that.  Why do you laugh so loudly?  What do you think of his cheeks?  What?  I'm showing you a brother, too?  What?  There's nothing wrong with looking at it.  Believe me, if he didn't know it was me, that's gender neutral.  That's a nice little gender neutral.  Dude, let it...  No, I don't need to.  Let it fall now.  Come on.  What?  Just let it sag.  No, I'm not pulling my hug out.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Let your ass fall.  Let your ass go to where it goes.  You prop it up with a belt, like a tourniquet. 
[02:58:30]  There.  That's how it goes.  There.  See how it slumps in?  It goes...  Oh, my God.  Two lima beans with hepatitis on them.  I had an ass.  Oh, that awful.  What do you think of the ass?  It's not bad, eh?  No, it's not, actually.  I've seen a lot worse.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A lot.  It's not hairy at all?  No, no.  You're like hairless or hairy or somewhere in between?  You gotta check out Jimmy's arm, though.  I don't like too much hair. 
[02:59:00]  You know, the whole carpet on the back.  We don't like too much hair.  Look at Jimmy's arm.  I have no hair.  But he always makes...  It's embarrassing.  I have, like, no...  I don't have a hair.  There's a little wisp.  So just run your finger.  Feel the little wisp.  Isn't that funny that most guys would, like, show their abs to a girl?  Like, that would be your first choice.  Like, no, I work out and stuff like that.  And Jimmy's gotta resort right to his ass. 
[02:59:30]  He's got no chest, no abs.  He goes right to the ass.  Jimmy has one of the nicest calves you'll ever see.  A bowling pin calf.  Sure.  Jimmy, it's your best body part.  Yeah, but she's married.  She won't be able to control herself.  Jimmy does have a good calf.  This is one of the best calves you'll ever see.  It's meaty.  Yeah, but it's not...  I haven't been running lately.  It doesn't matter.  Running.  Like, it matters.  See, go ahead.  Just look at it.  Not very impressed, but...  Nah, I didn't impress her like your ass did. 
[03:00:00]  Look at that calf.  Yeah.  That's a big calf muscle.  You wanna go ahead?  Just pat it.  It's like a Popeye calf.  You can pat it.  Feel that muscle.  Don't be shy.  Don't be shy.  You'll freak out.  No, no, not this time.  Not on the calf.  Wow, isn't that amazing?  Oh my god.  How great would it be if she did that and I came?  If she squeezed my calf and I came...  How great would it be?  Yeah.  Look at the front of your pants.  Liar.  All right.  I have a good bod.  All right, so we're gonna let you go there  because nothing's gonna happen here.  Well, I think we had a nice in-depth interview.  You're very nice.  Thank you. 
[03:00:30]  Very pretty.  We have nothing against you personally.  We were just hoping for some stuff.  Yeah, we just...  Girls...  It's amazing how they treat this show.  And it's not you.  It's in general.  We've never really sat the girls down  and discussed it in this fashion.  We usually, you know, have them leave  and then we're all angry  and we're bitching and complaining  but we just wanted to, you know...  How about we ask the question?  You're obviously naked in penthouse.  You're the penthouse pet of the month.  Yeah, why?  No, actually, I'm not the pet of the month.  I'm just on the cover.  Cover girl.  On the cover girl.  That's still very impressive. 
[03:01:00]  That's pretty impressive.  So why wouldn't you get naked in a radio station?  Yeah, what's the logic there?  In front of guys like us.  You can be honest.  Just be completely honest.  You know what's so funny is like  when you shoot, it's in a very closed environment  and you have like perfect lighting  and everything's done perfectly.  Right.  So you feel a lot more comfortable.  It's just you and the photographer  and maybe one assistant or something.  It's a very small group.  So there's a misconception that you girls  aren't modest, but you are.  I am actually modest.  I don't walk around the beach in a bikini. 
[03:01:30]  There's no way.  No?  No, no.  Why?  What?  No, I'm...  You don't?  I know it doesn't make a whole lot of sense,  but I mean, everyone has their own...  You drive a real nice car,  you should be honking the horn, lady.  Right.  It's easy with the fresh expressions.  We all have insecurities, you know, and so...  What are your insecurities about that?  Yeah, what's...  I don't have...  What do you think is wrong with your body?  Oh.  Did you get shot?  You got that belly scar?  No, I don't have any scars. 
[03:02:00]  You got thug's life on your...  I think because my dad's Italian Yugoslavian,  we have the thick legs, very, you know, muscular,  and I hold my weight and...  Oh, you keep it in check?  It's kind of...  Now, where do you hold your weight?  In my legs.  In your legs?  Let's see your legs.  We'll tell you.  We'll be honest.  But I don't think so.  I think you're...  I think you have a misconception about your body.  I think it's great that even a 10 has issues with their body.  That's good.  But we could bring her down to crying if we criticize you enough.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  We've done it.  Thank you.  Oh, we would never...  Yeah, we would.  I would run if I was you.  It's been awful.  I don't...  It's hard.  You ever watch The Sopranos?  No, I haven't.  Yeah, there's a...  I don't really watch TV.  The daughter, Meadow, we had her on our show once and brought her to tears.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brought her to tears.  See, and that's why I don't want to take my dress off.  Pretty girl, pretty girl with a few insecurities and a few misspoken words and all of a sudden  words to hurt.  But we...  You see, we asked because we've never sat anybody down and said, what is it like we... 
[03:03:00]  And porn girls bother me more than anybody because...  Yeah, because they're just doing the whole thing.  But it's almost like...  And this is the feeling we get.  The girls come in and they get this like, well, you have nerve to ask me that.  That's not what I'm here for.  Yet, like, I'm a comic.  Like, so when I go on other radio shows, I got to be funny.  I mean, that's the reality.  They're not bringing me in just to sit and talk about the, you know, Iran nuclear situation.  We did.  We did.  What's that?  We did.  Is that like you're only getting naked for us? 
[03:03:30]  You're the only ones that see the goods.  Ooh.  So that was my thing is like why you're not comfortable being...  Shut up.  I'll punch your teeth out.  You're right.  Faggot I am.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to rub it the wrong way.  All right.  And by the way, if Kenny had threatened to punch my teeth out or pull or stupid Mars,  my response would have been far less confrontational.  Yeah.  You really did just put him down as somebody who would never, ever touch you.  But it wasn't...  It really wasn't out of a tough guy thing. 
[03:04:00]  That really does bother me.  He had the umbrella.  I thought he might take a poke at you with the umbrella.  Dude, I honestly got...  Which would have been one of the faggiest moves.  Like, that's a British move.  Oh, you, blimey bloke.  Bless me.  Like, poking with an umbrella.  I was going to open it and then fucking Kennedy's motorcade would have went by.  Get it?  Of course.  Yeah.  There was a little bit of a misunderstanding.  You sparked something, but it wasn't about you.  But see, now you came in and just your beauty in here and your essence has cleared the air,  which is very good.  Now we got to get back to the smell of testosterone. 
[03:04:30]  Man.  So you are in this month in July.  You're very sweet.  Ariana Giovanni.  July 2006.  She's on the cover.  And she's extremely hot.  And she's married to a guy whose music I like a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Yeah.  So thank you very much.  Yeah.  The zombie.  Well, thank you for coming in.  Thank you.  I just stared right at your tits, too.  That's pretty shallow.  I went to go looking.  I turned.  I'm going to go look at you because they don't, you know, they move.  I turned from Jimmy to look at you right in the eyes because I usually liked looking at 
[03:05:00]  the guests in the eyes and say, thank you for coming in.  And my eyes just went, bam, right down.  You never look at women in the eyes.  There's just like three girls that have yelled at him because he just talks to their tits.  And they're like, come on, dude.  That is not true.  It's to be expected.  I am.  But I'm a gentleman.  If I wear a low-cut shirt, I mean, what do you expect?  I'm a gentleman.  All right.  And I'm a professional broadcaster who doesn't get into fights with other people on the staff.  I don't get into fights?  Hello.  How many people?  Who does that?  Let's look at the people who have fought on what's supposed to be a professional show. 
[03:05:30]  Greg Hughes.  Jimmy Norton's two for two.  Excuse me.  Because I'll tell you one thing.  Excuse me.  I've only had seven fights.  First of all, I've punched three people and I've had two or three verbal exchanges.  He's punched listeners.  He's a despicable ass.  Any of them who are mad at me, I'm sure at times they're mad at Ope and they would never  get into it with Ope.  And they know that would be a bad move.  Bad move? 
[03:06:00]  Bad move.  You think it's ruling with an iron fist?  No, no.  But they just know.  Is it better to be loved or feared?  I say C.  The Anthony factor, which is we like him.  He's funny.  But he probably will show up with a rifle if there's a problem.  Yeah.  You're the one most likely to go postal.  My anger's right there.  Everyone sees it.  It's the people like you you wonder about.  I reach a limit and then I kind of explode.  What nationality are you?  My dad's Italian and Yugoslavian and my mom's French, German, Irish, and American Indian. 
[03:06:30]  Wow.  You've got a little bit of everything in you there.  I'm a lot.  Wow.  Want a little Polish in you?  Stop it.  Oh, boy.  I got a million.  You know something?  I have never heard that joke.  You're too racy.  By that, you meant like you.  I don't know where he gets them.  I tell you.  He's got a million of them.  Language, young man.  This is still my home.  By the way, Pat from Boston.  Let me go here real fast. 
[03:07:00]  Pat.  Hey, I wanted to disagree with Anthony.  Greg Hughes has never gotten any fights.  Greg Hughes is a kind individual.  That's right.  Greg Opie, the character he plays on the air.  Greg Hughes, the actor, has never been in a fight.  When he's portraying Opie for the Opie and Anthony show, he's been in many fights.  That's right, Pat.  Right.  Thank you for that.  Thanks.  I get confused sometimes.  You're so good at your craft.  I'm an actor.  With the acting.  I really am.  He goes from Opie.  My name's Greg Hughes, and I play the part of Opie on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:07:30]  And when I discuss this, everyone looks away because they're creeped out by this, but it's the truth.  No one says anything.  That's just what you're listening is the internal dialogue someone has before they fall asleep.  When inside they go, am I really isolating everyone that much?  No, no, you're just an actor.  Okay.  All right.  I'm reading something on instant feedback that is a little disturbing.  Uh-oh. 
[03:08:00]  It's a little, it could cause some problems again.  They're saying that.  Did you, what?  Well.  Did, did you, now you gotta be honest, you're, this is a court of law.  Did you get naked on the Howard Stern show?  No, actually Howard never asked for me to show my boobs or get naked or anything.  Really?  He never asked.  Someone's saying you got naked on Stern.  No, I never got naked on Stern.  A couple of people were saying that.  No, I never got naked on Stern.  You just kind of sat down and did what?  Why is everyone saying you got naked on Stern?  There's like a million of them.  You should go and check and, I mean, they, they film it so you can see that I didn't. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  I believe her.  Yeah, I didn't.  I don't believe our stupid listeners.  I did go on Stern and typically they, you know, ask for you to get naked and everything.  Yeah.  You know, but he never asked.  We just talked.  Because, because you know something, even though he's a, he's an ass a lot of times, he probably  knows over the years, he's still a radio guy that's been in it for years, he probably  knows that it just doesn't happen.  Oh my God.  With the penthouse.  We're still talking to her.  Girl.  What?  Oh, babe.  What?  Be Greg Hughes for a moment. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, she's very nice.  Be civil.  Well, you know, we're just milking this until we get time to take a break.  Because everyone's scared to leave the studio and turn the mic off.  Because then the real conversations begin.  I got to take a leak.  Yeah, we got to take a leak.  So, if you could get up and walk out awkwardly so we could check out your, your big legs.  Oh, Jesus.  Opie.  Opie.  Why would you say that to such a pretty girl?  Well, she says she has a problem with her legs.  Don't you even.  I just want to say.  Yeah.  I bet you have a problem with her legs, though. 
[03:09:30]  It's like the problem.  Yeah.  Peace.  All right.  Let's get up.  What's wrong with those legs, you know?  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  They're fantastic.  Look.  Nice.  I have.  See?  Let me see.  Can we see the back?  The back of the thighs?  Let's see where the problem is.  Well, I'm sure they're fine.  That's what I don't like.  Wait, let's see where the problem is.  The back of the thighs?  She doesn't like the back of her thighs.  Yeah, let's see.  Let's see.  Yeah, we'll be nice.  We'll be nice.  I'm going to grab you.  Turn around.  Turn around, though.  We'll see the back of the legs.  She's got some nice lingerie under there.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  I see it.  Oh, she's lovely.  No, you don't see shit.  Don't you mind?  You know something?  How you bring down a girl that's in penthouse, you're fine and dandy.  Yes, she is lovely.  If I may say fine and dandy.  Yes, you're wonderful.  In this situation, you may.  All right.  We have to take a break.  We have to take leaks.  And we've got Mark Cuban calling in from the Dallas Mavericks during the NBA Finals.  Go Mavs.  Go.  Because we've got to go.  All right. 
[03:10:30]  So thank you so much.  Thank you for coming in.  For whatever you did.  The cover of Penthouse.  No, believe me.  July 2006.  Thanks for coming in because I just, promos, promos, promos are going to be made because  you came in.  You don't realize I'm going to hear promos of Ben and Jimmy and Opie.  It's going to be great.  You don't realize how much you help this show.  Yeah.  Because you come to work every day and you smile at people and you think they like you back.  Yeah.  But, you know, you don't realize that on their three and a half hour rides to Boston, they've 
[03:11:00]  just been bashing you the whole time.  They've just been lambasting you.  You don't realize that.  So you helped open up wounds.  Whenever I can be honest.  You were very helpful.  I encourage Steve not to hold back and make promos out of the last hour of this radio show.  Don't hold back.  But I encourage others in our corporation, our company, to be as honest and forthcoming.  As me?  Of course.  You are very honest.  There are other people that were implicated by Ben. 
[03:11:30]  Other people implicated by Ben and Steve that are not opening their mouths.  It's that little fuck right there with the camera.  He's all pissed off.  Are you an intern?  We don't even know his name.  Oh, he doesn't get paid anyway.  We don't even know his name.  Yeah.  It's Hawk.  I know him.  He stashed away his hundred grand that he won in the lotto.  And he's still bitching about it, Cash.  He has fucking...  This intern has hair.  It looks like...  Remember in the beginning of Born on the Fourth of July when Cruz was still wrestling before  he got shot in Nam?  He looks like Ronnie Colvich, age 17. 
[03:12:00]  I should run to the prom in the rain, stupid.  And I would like to know who else has a problem.  I think there is some detention in that room.  We've got to take a break.  Let's take a break and then we'll get back to it.  Okay.  Thank you so much for coming.  Aria Giovanni is really, really hot.  Giovanni.  You're terrific.  You're terrific, actually.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I don't believe you.  Why?  He's being honest.  Yeah?  No.  We've never actually sat down, one of you girls, and had a discussion like that.  I don't really need to step out of character.  You're beautiful. 
[03:12:30]  Thank you.  We're all watching the mouth by the mic.  You're beautiful.  Just.  Beautiful.  Just.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  And.  Cut.  Stop it.  You're incorrigible. 
[03:13:00]  We're on the radio.  All right, make that pass.  We got Mark Cuban on hold here.  Well, let's see.  Mr. Torrance from Whackbag saying, Ben Fredo, when razors were being passed out, I was passed over.  It's the way Elo wanted it.  It ain't the way I wanted it.  With that, we got to say hi to Mark Cuban.  Mark.  What's up, boys?  Now I hear you only have like three minutes because we were wasting time with some bra that wouldn't get naked in our studio. 
[03:13:30]  You know what?  Except for nakedness, I'll hang on a little longer.  She never got naked, Mark.  You just didn't see me.  We need your money.  We need your money to get this done.  See?  Now we're talking to somebody with some cash.  By the way, this is our only billionaire friend.  Yeah.  We have one billionaire friend, and his name is Mark Cuban.  But, Mark, could you not talk about your money because some people get upset about it.  Yeah.  I won't talk about all those billions I have sitting in the bank and how incredibly good looking I got when those billions got in my bank account.  No, I would never talk about that. 
[03:14:00]  Private jets.  Yeah, and all that good stuff.  How much money would you estimate is just laying around your pad because you don't have time to go to the bank?  Well, I mean, you know, it's not worth it for me to bend over and pick up anything less than $100.  You know, the maid sweeps them up.  It gets into the vacuum, and then she cleans them up and puts them in a stack for me.  Let me ask you, is it like, as a guy with that much, do you look at most women, no matter how hot they are, and go,  almost any woman I see, I know I can have for the right price?  Not necessarily in a prostitution way, but you could take her out and buy her a Bentley. 
[03:14:30]  No, man.  I say, you know what?  Is it Whip Him Out Wednesday?  Yes.  No, you can't do that.  You drive yourself crazy.  You know, I mean, seriously, though, you don't...  Well, it's good to know you can, Mark.  Yeah, well, it's good to know you can if you really had to pull out that card.  My buddies, when I'm out with my boys, that's all they talk about.  So, you know, I get reminded all the time.  Hey, when do we get a ride on the private jet and all that?  I'm starting to feel like we're pretty good friends now.  We go way back, I know.  Yeah, come on. 
[03:15:00]  I won't tell the story that you guys accosted me in the halls and, you know, in Dallas at the arena, but that's okay.  Hey, my brother's here.  He was there, too, man.  And Mark Cuban is one of the coolest guys I've ever met, man.  We went to a Dallas Mavericks game when we were in Dallas, seeing one of...  I don't think it was one of Jimmy's shows, and he gave us the royal treatment,  got to see the locker rooms with the flat-screen TVs for all the players.  Yeah, it was a good time, man.  Now you've got to take me out in New York City or something.  Oh, wow. 
[03:15:30]  What kind of time are you going to be able to show?  You won't be a millionaire anymore, Opie.  You want a glass of wine in my rat-slash-mice cockroach-infested apartment  that's now flooded because I've got a slum landlord?  Yeah, well, let's go raise some hell.  You might as well get your money's worth, right?  And the sad part is I am finally making a lot of money.  Are you?  Man, that's the thing about New York.  I told you it's going to be all about money for the rest of the show.  Hey, we're all rooting for the Mavs, obviously.  Hell yes.  You've got to take Pat Riley out and Shaq and all them out. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, man, I can't wait.  You know what?  It's going to be such a great series.  There's going to be so much trash talking between Shaq and Peyton and Alonzo  and our guys and me.  I mean, we ain't backing down.  It's going to be a war, and it's going to be a blast.  And I've got to tell you, even if you can't get tickets to a game between Dallas  and Miami just to go for the parties, it's just going to be incredible.  You have to be honest.  I was always kind of like a Lakers fan, I say kind of, because I'm not a massive  Lakers fan.  And I was really happy to see Shaquille get this far, because it really did prove 
[03:16:30]  how important he watched that team, because Kobe is just such a spoiled baby.  Yeah, you know, it's crazy.  All the people who love Kobe are rooting for the Mavs to just kill Shaq right now.  And, you know, there's all the old Laker fans that love Shaq that are rooting  against the Mavs.  What kind of personality do you have to have that you're actually rooting for Shaq?  He's not that much better.  He's actually a cool dude, man.  He's actually a really cool dude.  So I can dig, I can go with people liking Shaq, but, you know, to be a Laker fan  and like the Heat, that's where you've got to stretch it. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, it's not that I like the Heat.  I just, I'm really happy to see it, because I liked him, man.  You never hear bad stuff about him in the media.  He's just one of those guys that just everybody seems to like.  And Kobe just seems like such a spoiled little brat.  I feel it's...  Yeah, Kobe's kind of a different cat.  I feel it's the Mavericks year, I've got to tell you, Mark.  I mean, I hope so.  I think it's finally here.  You guys have been close so many times.  So many times.  I hope so.  I mean, I'm ready.  I'm ready to roll it out.  And I've got to tell you, if we win it, you ain't ever seen a party like a Mark Cuban party.  Could you invite us to a Mark Cuban party?  Oh, man, my God. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, that means a no.  That would be a no.  Yeah, well, I haven't had one in a long time, because, you know...  That would be a no.  Now it's tough for me to throw a big party.  I used to throw them all the time.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, I was reading, like, your latest stuff, and I had no idea that your film was  Good Night and Good Luck.  I saw that.  Yeah, Good Night and Good Luck.  What do you have to do with that?  Two Guys in the Room, Akeelah and the Bee, those are all our films.  Wait, what's the other ones?  Akeelah and the Bee, which is about a little girl who grows up and wins a spelling bee.  It's like a feel-good movie for kids. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  I kind of heard about it.  It turned out great.  But I saw Good Night and Good Luck.  Yeah.  Rocking, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was really good.  Are you just a producer, or do you do more?  Executive producer, and I don't...  Some of the movies...  It depends on the movie and what it's about, but that was one with Clooney, and that was his  baby, so I didn't have a whole lot to do but help with marketing.  And just hanging out with Clooney...  Hey, he's a huge basketball fan, man.  We're talking about bringing him to one of the Mavs games, hanging out, shooting some buckets.  The guy's really into...  He's a good dude, man.  And after he won an Oscar, I got invited back to his third after-hours party at 3 in the 
[03:18:30]  morning in L.A., and I walk in, and there's his buddies he grew up with, and maybe 10 other  people, Madonna, Uma Thurman, Cindy Crawford.  I'm like...  Look at this.  Body shots, let's roll.  Just hanging out.  You know, Clooney's living the life.  Mark Cuban looks at Clooney and just goes, God, this guy's living the life.  Oh, yeah.  No, he doesn't.  Mark Cuban looks at Clooney and says, I could hand any girl he's banging money and tell her 
[03:19:00]  to spit in George's face.  No, George is the man.  He's just done.  Yeah, he's a partier.  Oh, yeah.  So when are you going to retire, Mark?  I am retired.  This is what I do for fun.  Isn't that amazing?  His hobby is just, ah, owning a basketball team.  No, hey, I'm the luckiest dude in the world.  I get to go wherever, do whatever.  I got a great family.  You know, it's...  When I say I want to come back as me, that's the only thing I can say.  Some people, though, don't like you.  This is Ben S. from New York City. 
[03:19:30]  I want to punch your teeth out.  Tell him, you know, next time he sees me, to walk up and give it a shot.  Yeah, well...  You know, I don't care.  I don't think he liked the fact that, you know, you talk about your money.  Yeah, well, you know, if he can't deal with it.  And then there was a story about Steve C.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not what I meant.  A little inside stuff, Mark, but it's making us laugh.  Hey, has the NBA left you alone lately?  No, I got dinged for $200,000 about a month ago, but I think... 
[03:20:00]  What was that one?  Dinged?  Because I raised a little...  I mean, it was benign.  It wasn't even anything good.  I didn't get my money's worth, but I was talking about changes that they need to make with some  of the marketing stuff and some of the officials and stuff like that.  I didn't get...  You know, it wasn't a good scream, and it wasn't anything at a game.  It was just some talk, and they just didn't like it.  Why can't you criticize...  This is what makes me sick about professional sports.  Why are the officials not held accountable when they're not doing their jobs? 
[03:20:30]  You know, that's what I'm trying to figure out, too.  But, you know, I'll get my way.  It'll end up working.  You know, it will make...  It's just part of the game, but you got to do what you can to make it better.  But the NBA, you know, whether it's the NBA, NFL, whatever, none of the commissioners,  nobody wants to look bad.  And they figure if you're questioning the officials, you're questioning them.  Mark, we were talking about this yesterday, about sports in general, how they're taking  a lot of the excitement out of the games.  Like, we had this story in New York.  This kid comes up from the minors.  He hits his first homer for the Mets. 
[03:21:00]  I thought that was great when he went down and high-fiving everybody.  Yeah, exactly.  We did, too.  And he got reprimanded.  And Willie Randolph, and actually, Lastings is his name, said he won't do it again.  Like, they already castorized the guy.  What's the kid's first name again?  Like, Lastings?  Oh, Jesus.  Or something?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Lastings.  Wow.  That was a good point.  You know, if you...  That word is spread all over the highway.  Oh, my God.  You know, if you grow up with a name like that, you've got to be able to celebrate something,  right?  And then, I mean, I was thinking about it. 
[03:21:30]  He's done that for the Mavs.  You know, if a guy hits a game-time shot and high-fives some fans running back down the court,  I'd be like, hell yes.  Get the fans involved.  Have some fun.  And, you know, that's what sports is about.  It's a game.  It's supposed to be about fun, right?  Yes.  Absolutely.  I'll stick to three-letter ones.  We're still trying to get past castorized.  That's actually the process that milk goes through when you cut its cock off.  I got a little excited.  But, I mean, the NBA is one of the only sports, and hockey to some extent, that still has a 
[03:22:00]  lot of the excitement still in it.  Yeah, hockey's cool.  I mean, I love going to hockey games.  And, you know, as long as it's in high definition, I can even watch it, you know.  Do you own that, too?  Do you own the HD?  Yeah, of course.  Two channels, right?  No, I don't mean an HD TV.  Do you own the whole thing?  No, man.  No, I'm trying.  But, no, not yet.  Hey, Mark, are they your channels on HD that have, like, all those great cityscape shows,  like all these great visual shows?  They'll just show landscapes?  No, no.  That's in HD.  That's kind of boring now. 
[03:22:30]  We have HDNet and HDNet movies.  So, if you have, like, DirecTV or Time Warner cable.  I have Time Warner.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you can see them on Time Warner.  So, we've got all kinds of great shows on there.  And we show some hockey.  We show soccer.  And we've got great TV and movies.  But if you've got a high-def set, you've got to get it, man.  It's just unbelievable.  You've seen it.  It just rules.  Yeah.  We're looking forward to the day that you just lose your mind at a Mavs game and you just  run on the court completely naked.  You didn't see it last time?  I know it's going to happen with you. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  Hey, if we win the championship.  You wish for it.  But he would do it.  Oh, yeah.  Mark Cuban doesn't give a crap.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, people, Dennis Rodman used to talk about, you know, running off the  court naked his last game.  Man, I'd be flopping all over the city if we win a championship.  That's how stoked I'll be.  Hey, how did it feel rolling over Steve Nash?  Oh, well, you know, Nash is a good guy.  He's a good guy.  I mean, I hung out, had a great time with him.  And it actually, it felt bad.  I felt bad because he is a good guy.  But, you know, I didn't feel bad that long. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  All right on, Mark.  All right.  Well, you guys going to come down for a game?  Well, we're waiting for the tickets and the plane ride.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Jet Blue.  I'm coming up there first to test you out in New York.  All right.  We'll hang out in New York so you get the job done.  So we can hang with Mark Cuban.  This is why Mark is good, though, because you asked him at the party.  He goes, yeah, no, yeah, they have them.  We have them, you know.  And then you'll ask him at the plane ride.  He says, yeah, man, they go high on those planes.  Yeah, the plane rides are tougher, you know? 
[03:24:00]  It's because 20 times a day this guy is being asked, hey, this party, you're going, you're  away.  So he's figured out how to be diplomatic.  Well, everybody wants to be his friend.  Everyone wants to be his friend.  What does it take to be your friend, Mark?  About 20 bucks.  Well, do you find that people treat you differently, obviously, because you have so much money  and they pretend that they like you?  I'm not saying they don't like you, but they...  You know what?  I don't even deal with people like that.  Nah, he sniffs that crap out.  Okay.  Yeah, you know what?  I got some great buddies and, you know, if I want to go hang out or run around, I've  got my boys that I've been running with for 20 years. 
[03:24:30]  Well, I'd like to hang out with you because you have a billion dollars.  Yeah, you would, he said.  Yeah, you would.  Just pick up the scraps.  Yeah, Jimmy likes hookers.  Hey, no, you know what?  I'm married, so I'm like the world's best wingman.  And so my buddies know it, too.  Yeah.  It's like, I don't need anything.  I'm good.  And so I just, you know, flip the switch and turn them over to my buddies and everybody's  happy.  I can't see you being a good wingman, though, because any girl who's like looking to hook  up with Mark Cuban, if I'm sitting there as option number two, that's like, that's a 
[03:25:00]  step off a cliff.  Oh, no, no, no.  You got to lie like my buddies do.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I'm his financial advisor.  You didn't hear the story about how when he sold his company, all his friends, you know,  these guys have more BS than you could ever imagine.  So you just got to let it wing it.  And whatever they're saying, I'm saying yes to.  So it all works.  All right, Mark, the big prediction.  I'm not going to predict, man.  But all I know is I'm fired up about these Mavericks, man.  Everybody's got to be watching come Thursday night on ABC. 
[03:25:30]  And, you know, it's going to be crazy.  I'm going to be crazy.  Everybody, the game's going to be, it's going to be a great game.  All right.  Good luck, man.  Good luck.  I'll take it, guys.  Yeah, right on, Mark.  We love you, man.  Same here.  Appreciate it.  Appreciate it always.  You guys are always great to me.  Much appreciated.  All right.  Mark Cuban, everyone.  Thanks, Mark.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Take care.  He's the real deal.  Yeah.  He's a great owner, man, because he speaks his mind, and he calls out the shitty officiating,  and that's what they should all do.  Officiating stinks.  I like how he says he took a ding for $200,000. 
[03:26:00]  $200,000 isn't a ding.  It's an anvil.  Yeah.  Right across the forehead.  And it's castrated.  It was just funny.  That was so funny.  I knew it as it was coming out.  You crossed castrated and chastised.  Right, right, right.  And got-  I was getting so excited, because he was into it, and then we could have had a whole discussion,  but I don't even know what he said.  Oh, that's so funny.  Castrization.  No, I-  He said castrization.  Did you?  No.  Why don't I do a milk joke?  I thought it was castricized.  I said castricized.  Castricized.  I said castricized.  Because it's almost like pasteurized. 
[03:26:30]  That was it.  Right.  Castricized.  Because you want chastised.  Oak.  And castrate.  Right.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I was-  I had both-  Yeah, well, whatever.  You made a new word.  Dope.  I hate when you mix two words up like that, and they just come flying out of your mouth.  Like money and humor.  Humor.  That's really good.  Stop it.  All right, we wanted to play this earlier, but we had a bad copy, so it's Eight Ways to  Save Gas.  Ah, see?  Another money-themed thing.  Absolutely.  We want to save money on gas. 
[03:27:00]  A penny saved-  Is a dollar earned.  No, a penny-  What?  A penny saved-  Is a dollar earned.  But that's not true, though.  No, that isn't it.  It's a lie.  Penny wise and dollar foolish.  A dollar earned is a penny saved.  No, penny wise and-  It's a clown.  You know what?  A fun-loving clown.  Of course.  I've come to rob all the women, rape all the men, and learn to do the Peppermint Twist,  and then to do a shuck and jive with a balloon in one hand and a severed child's leg in the  other. 
[03:27:30]  Here's a little joke if you like them, miss.  My fodder bore me right out of my mutter.  He shat me from his asshole.  Tee-hee-hee-hee-hee!  Tee-hee-hee!  Goddamn, that's great.  By the way, my brother's here, and he hasn't done one Samantha impression for us.  Oh.  When are you going to do the Samantha impression?  And he invented the bit.  You invented the bit.  That I took.  Speaking of the bit.  Speaking of sucking small Asian car. 
[03:28:00]  It's like, wait, we weren't talking about that, Sam.  But that's what we're always talking about.  Oh.  Don't you ever read the paper or just go to the movies?  I'm a one-dimensional character.  So I was shopping again the other day.  Speaking of licking on some serious pussy.  But I just talked about shopping.  It had nothing to do with pussy.  You are so one-dimensional. 
[03:28:30]  Speaking of one-dimensional.  Oh, I can't take it.  Watch the TBS.  You know, when you're watching TBS and the ads come on.  Tin, tin, tin, tin.  And it's just, they play the commercial.  And I just, I have to rewind it.  Because I don't get it.  It's like, oh boy.  I was out all night last night.  Were you?  What happened?  I met a guy at a bar and, and I went home and dreamt about a camel eating some hay. 
[03:29:00]  And you're like, what, wait, what the fuck?  Did, did she just say that?  There, a complete lack of humor in those promos.  They make no sense.  You gotta have a vagina maybe to understand it.  Speaking of vagina.  Speaking of sense.  Speaking of sense.  My asshole's so big for being drilled by black cock last night.  Really?  What does that have to do with sense?  Well. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  Turn sideways.  You can't see her.  She's so one-dimensional.  And my brother's got his new wow shirts out there.  So go to myradiostore.com.  Why is your brother doing my bit?  No.  It was my bit that you stole.  No, I was doing the Samantha thing.  Oh, years ago, right?  I'm a big fan of the show.  He came up with the bit.  I brought it to the show because he just went and called the show.  Ask him about who used to do it at Pips, okay?  Ripping off.  Everyone did everything at Pips and I ripped off dice. 
[03:30:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Speaking of Pips.  Yeah, so get your wow shirts.  Brown vintage wow shirts.  The first wow design in many years.  I'd love to help promote it, but I never get any shirts.  I would like some wow shirts.  Yeah, these guys are, they want to buy them.  We want our shirts.  Money bags.  I don't know what to tell them anymore.  Wah, wah, cash.  Well, this is the first time hearing of it, so.  The reason I won't buy it is because he can't change a thousand dollar bill.  Just go to myradiostore.com for shirts.  All right, let's up.  Opie, you didn't get dumped on. 
[03:30:30]  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Hey, we never did the dump report today, by the way.  Because we started yelling and screaming.  What happened?  Did I even get one?  If I don't have one in front of me in three, two.  Minutes.  Yeah.  Why would the dump report be in front of us?  Why?  Why would it be?  And things were happening.  There was a big, ah.  Oh, look at it. 
[03:31:00]  He gets right to me.  I love you, Danny.  I know how it works.  Danny, any problems with any material we might go over in here?  Any subject that's touched on?  Do you take it personally when we talk about money?  Do you take it personally when anything is, yes, you're being honest?  Yeah, yeah.  He's just happy to be here.  Would you like to take a shot at Jimmy's mouth?  Not with your fist, with your cock.  I'm talking with a big load of cum.  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's start off small.  Let me talk to this kid and see what he eats. 
[03:31:30]  Danny.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, this is easy stuff today.  Yeah.  The dump report.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the daily dump report.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Well, I never, I figured I'd get dumped.  6.22 a.m.  This is really a big surprise.  Shut the fuck up.  That's Opie yelling at Pam, the caller who doesn't think the show is funny.  That's right.  Shut the fuck up. 
[03:32:00]  A mere minute later at 6.23 a.m.  Anthony, I have a dump.  Oh, what bad thing did I say?  Giving out someone's email address that he banned from instant feedback.  Our lawyers don't want us giving out this info.  It's interesting.  7.36 a.m.  Fuck you.  Drunk woman caller.  7.36 a.m.  Fuck.  Drunken woman caller.  7.39 a.m.  You're like my fucking kids.  Drunk woman caller.  7.40.  You're fucking assholes. 
[03:32:30]  Drunk woman caller.  Wow, she is in the lead for the week.  And she still has less than Leary.  Yeah, I know.  And that's it.  That's it.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 today.  4 of them were drunk woman caller.  One Opie, one me.  All right, here we go.  8 ways to save gas.  Fox 5 News.  We were going to get to this hours ago.  This is going to be funny.  Well, yeah.  I mean, you know, because summer's here and everyone's going to be taking their summer trips.  And most people want to drive because it's cheaper than flying.  How do you save money on gas? 
[03:33:00]  So, of course, news stations have to get on the whole gas thing.  Sure, you could save a couple of cents by pumping yourself.  Oh, what are they getting at?  Pick up an Asian and beat him while he pulls a rickshaw.  I don't know why.  That was a bad impression.  I don't do good impersonations.  Speaking of pumping gas.  I drive a hybrid.  These gas jokes rubbed me the wrong way. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, my God.  It's never going to end.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.  Don't say change.  That's a monetary.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes.  Someone says Jimmy's new thing should be wah-wah pennies.  All right, here we go.  8 ways to save gas.  Fox 5 News.  It's the dreaded trip to the pump.  But there are things you can do to save on gas.  We turn to the experts to steer drivers in the right direction with a driving test to find out what's fact and fiction. 
[03:34:00]  Lowering your speed.  Does that save on gas?  Why did they need that music?  Did they attempt to...  Was that taking it to the streets?  By the doobie brothers.  Like a second of it?  Yeah, because you're taking it to the streets.  Wasn't that what the recording rerun got on the Panasonic tape recorders shoved in his fat belly?  I'm going to jail for a fat kid eating popcorn.  We thought you were our friend, rerun.  When the tape falls out of his fucking thing and then Mabel King is trying to record and both her legs fall out from underneath her dress. 
[03:34:30]  What were the doobies thinking at that time, at that moment?  Hey, it sounded like a good idea.  We're going to do a What's Happening.  When we remember jumping up and down, they were probably expecting Jessica Lange or Naomi Watts to fall out of his shirt.  Fat fruitcake he was.  What kind of quality recording are you going to get with a tape recorder shoved in a fat guy's jacket? 
[03:35:00]  Here we go.  Lowering your speed.  Does that save on gas?  Lower speeds?  Yes, they do.  I don't think it matters about, you know, how fast you go.  Triple A has the answer.  Oh, most definitely so.  When you run 55 or 60 miles an hour versus 70 or 75, you can notice a difference.  Will using cruise control save on gasoline?  People with cruise control that don't use it, it's an option. 
[03:35:30]  If they'd use it, they'd notice a gas savings.  Will turning off the A.C. and rolling down your window save gas?  I don't think that it would matter one way or the other.  You really aren't going to find a whole lot of difference with the windows up or with the windows down.  So, why not ride in comfort with the windows up?  Will checking your tire pressure bring substantial savings?  Yes.  Exactly.  I think so.  Tire pressure is important for stability of the vehicle and the fact that tires don't overheat, especially in the summertime during longer trips.  Gas mileage-wise, 2% to 3%, maybe somewhere around that. 
[03:36:00]  That's it, huh?  You're saving a buck.  Two bucks.  That was arguably the most uninformative thing I've ever heard.  Horrid.  Horrid.  I mean, I've heard dreck.  That's the most uninformative thing.  I'm 37 that I've heard, and I mean from inception.  So, almost 38 years.  God, that's a long time.  I am not buying the speed thing, because you're burning more gas when you go faster, but you're getting there faster. 
[03:36:30]  You're shutting your vehicle off quicker.  Someone said you burn, like, 7% more fuel at 70 than you do at 55, but you're getting there quicker.  You've got to factor that in.  Factor that in.  God damn it, get out of my way.  You know what my grandmother used to say when somebody would speed by?  She would go, uh, oh, he was racing ahead.  He wants to be the first one to the accident. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, I get it, because he's, you know, going to...  And then I would say, uh, no, it's a good point, man.  And I'd drum my fist into her cunt.  Speaking of drumming a fist into my cunt.  Anyone want to see my ass cave?  Oh, I'm going to be gaping tonight.  All right.  Racing ahead to the accident.  Stupid.  She also told you to make sure you always wear clean underwear, I bet. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, she's like, wear clean underwear.  You never know when I'm going to want to just suck your cock.  What happened?  How did that get nothing?  Oh, because I said, oh, goody.  Oh.  Okay.  You're right over.  I'll listen on the replay, and I'll laugh, and I'll call you.  Do you want to hear it?  Heart, heart, yes.  When he said to your grandmother, said, always wear clean underwear, she would always...  I said, yeah, she would always say, wear clean underwear.  You never know when I'm just going to want to suck your cock.  Yeah, that's very funny.  You don't have a lot of faith in wanting to do it twice. 
[03:38:00]  Yes.  That's a no-brainer.  We've got to do a show on all that grandma advice.  Yes.  Bob.  As long as nobody has any objections to the subject matter.  Yeah, we don't want to piss off anyone's grandma.  We'll check it out.  We'll check, make sure.  Bob is very upset with us.  Bob!  You guys seriously are fucking terrible.  You do the same thing over and over again.  Try doing a new bit that Howard hasn't done yet.  All you know how to do is listen to Howard's old shows to get ideas. 
[03:38:30]  Get a clue you guys blow.  Howard Stern is God.  Is he Bob Godfather43 at Hotmail.com?  That was the same address that got dumped out of.  I like the fact, though, that this guy is listening and paying attention.  It's what you should do.  Keep listening.  Keep listening, Bob.  Every day.  You know why?  Because you can't get enough, can you?  And you can't.  What's the matter?  What's the matter? 
[03:39:00]  Stern boring?  It's all boring to you, so you come here?  You'll keep listening.  Yeah, I'm sure he's still on the radio, right?  Keep listening.  I'm sure he's doing direct like us.  Oh, yeah.  Right now?  He's God.  All right.  God.  Idling in traffic.  Eight ways to save gas.  Fox 5 News.  What if you're stuck in traffic and idling for a while?  Oh, I know, I know.  Should we shut it down?  I know.  Finger of baby.  Jesus, Jimmy.  I don't know.  I just thought the...  What? 
[03:39:30]  Is that going to save fuel?  Oh, I just thought it might make the time pass.  The cops pull you over, and then...  Sorry.  The rest of the trip is in their car, and you've saved a bunch of gas.  That's right, because you get towed.  Right.  I don't know why I said that.  It just came out.  I apologize.  Should you shut her down?  Sit there and idling with the air conditioner on.  You're keeping cool, but your dollars are just going out the tailpipe.  We're buying a hybrid car, Sid.  Out the tailpipe.  They just might.  They're a little bit more efficient.  The jury's still out on that a little bit, but as far as the price difference in the  car and what the savings is, that's yet to be seen. 
[03:40:00]  Will getting rid of junk in your trunk save gas?  I would think so if your trunk is loaded down.  You don't need to carry everything out of your garage.  Let's take out the things you don't need.  And finally, do aggressive drivers save the most on gas?  Yes.  They'll be at the gas pump first, too.  You know, no.  Just take your time, pre-plan your trips, and leave early.  Enough to avoid any type of delays.  You know, in fact, the experts say driving moderately versus aggressively can mean a major 
[03:40:30]  savings of up to 37%, so that'll save you a pretty penny.  A pretty penny, mind you.  Will it?  Cliche-slinging twat.  God.  A pretty penny.  Enough with the experts on the news.  You know what a pretty penny is?  It's one that's on a clit.  Now that's pretty.  That's right.  All right, we'll take a break, and then we'll...  What do you say we break?  And hey, Eric, thanks for sending salmon for my juice.  Where is fucking toilet seat covered hair, Eric? 
[03:41:00]  I wanted some fruit juice, because I'm trying to be healthier.  Where is that fucking flat-footed horse's patoot?  All right, sweetie.  Where's eagle nest head?  That's right, stupid.  You heard the boss.  Your fucking head should have an endangered species on it.  You look like a baby eagle and an eagle's nest at the same time.  That's right. 
[03:41:30]  All for two.  Bare skin rug head makes us all nauseous.  He just sits there.  He knows better.  He knows we're right.  That's why.  Hawk's a good boy.  Looks around.  I bet you one thing, he's going to start growing out that hair, right?  That's right.  That go-fuck-yourself look on his face.  Yeah, it certainly is.  Look at him being defiant.  Hell no.  That's a mullet light.  Look at...  I feel so bad for him.  He just sits there, I'm like...  You know who I feel bad for? 
[03:42:00]  Whatever girl has to bang him and not go,  could you fucking put a hat on?  All right, that's low.  What?  That's low, he says.  I'm sorry.  I've never seen a mullet store at the top of the forehead.  Hey, fucking...  Hey, hey, hey, uh...  Hey, ducky from Sixteen Candles.  What? 
[03:42:30]  Sorry.  How fast is instant feedback scrolling?  Do you guys get a ton of these?  I send them, and they only get acknowledged sometimes.  Sam, say it.  Sam, don't write it down.  Say it.  Come on, Sam.  Let her rip.  There's a video of Iraq's hair up on opianthony.com.  Is there?  Is there?  What's happening in the video? 
[03:43:00]  You're comparing his hair to the Hawaiian Punch guy.  Wow, across America.  True tales from the road.  Real people, real stories, real boos.  I was at the Wawa on someone ads,  and I just had the Opie Anthony Wow sticker on the back of my car,  and all of a sudden, I just see, like, some monster breath  in my face, and it was very big.  I got wowed.  We were driving on the Grand Central Parkway.  They were all right.  They were a little saggy.  Yeah, I just got wowed, and you know what? 
[03:43:30]  I don't even really care.  I just got wowed on I-95 in Virginia.  It was awesome.  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony Wow line,  866-WOW-ME-05.

Yeah, Joe, looking for a new Bono.  And Joe doesn't really want this mentioned,  but he'd prefer somebody with a larger cock. 
[03:46:30]  It's not necessary, but your shot is better.  No, actually, you're lying.  Actually.  He does want it mentioned.  Actually, he wants to do something a little different.  He wants a black Bono.  That's right.  No, he told me that before the show today.  He wants you to cough a lot so they can call you a Mono.  They actually call him Sam Bono.  Hold on.  Let me just languish in that bomb.  Good.  You heard it, right?  Yes.  Oh.  And I quickly steered around it with my bomb.  Oh, Sam Bono?  Oh, boy.  No, I didn't say a word. 
[03:47:00]  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I was so busy feeling shame and revulsion that I didn't hear you fucking, I didn't hear  you slam into the back of my car.  My airbag went off and I'm safe, though.  Yeah, so I guess, yeah, there you go.  And Joe's got gigs booked.  He's going to some countries I can't even freaking understand.  I don't know.  They're getting along.  It's just what?  His voice is shot?  Something with his voice.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They need like another. 
[03:47:30]  That's got to suck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another new Bono.  Joe finally, you know, got it all together with the band thing.  He's loving life.  They're playing in like Honduras and these other big stadiums in Honduras and then some  other place.  I don't even know where the hell it is.  Somewhere in South America or Central America.  Yeah.  So looking for that.  Godspeed.  All right.  Have fun.  Hey, Travis Hader calls Wow Line.  What's this about?  Someone hates Travis. 
[03:48:00]  How could anybody?  It's impossible.  I know it's physically impossible.  I mean, for people that don't, how could you not like Travis?  Kids all cuck.  Well, where do we start?  Where is he?  Where's that waif?  You could always see him because he's got that blinking red light in front of his face.  Where's that Euro trash model?  Waif, heroin chic.  How could I?  Without the chic.  Or he's heroin chic, but that's just because he dresses like an Arab. 
[03:48:30]  So someone hates you, Travis?  I don't know.  Why?  What happened?  I was...  Uh-oh.  Who came to the table with this?  I don't know.  It's on the Wow Line.  Guy who apparently has called the program.  Oh, yeah.  Steve told me about this.  I chose you.  Here's the explanation.  Guy who apparently has called the program a number of times and been hung up on by Travis.  Oh, Travis screens the calls, so of course he has a lot of enemies.  Calls to bash the little fella.  The little fella.  Oh.  Travis, by the way, you do a great job screening. 
[03:49:00]  Thank you, and that's probably why he's not happy.  No, you really do.  Cocky there.  Travis fighting back.  No, it's not an easy job.  No, it's not.  While we're hanging out having a good time, people are trying to get on this show all morning  long.  And you think it's an easy job where you just plunk down some calls.  How many calls do you think you answer during one show?  Six, seven?  Could be a couple more than that, Jimmy.  Hundreds.  Hundreds.  Oh, easily, yeah.  Hundreds and hundreds of calls a day.  This guy didn't appreciate that you hung up on him. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, I just got wild, and you know what?  I don't even really care.  All I care about is that Travis, that faggot who answers your phone, I'm going to beat the  snot out of him.  I hate that faggot.  He brings the show to a stop.  Anytime you get something funny, he hangs up on you.  He's a piece of shit.  I'm going to definitely beat the piss out of that kid.  I hope you play this over and over again, because I can't stop obsessing with beating  up that pussy.  I don't disagree. 
[03:50:00]  Wow.  He doesn't like you.  I guess he's not happy.  People call back all the time when I hang up on him.  He sounds like a funny guy.  Oh, yeah.  I don't understand why you don't put him through.  I don't know.  Well, if he calls back, you know.  We'll put you through next time.  This young scumbag is going to be reprimanded, and you, sir, are going to be put through.  Right.  This young punk.  Because you must have something great to say.  He showed me.  So call in, sir.  Call in.  Go through the poor people.  Talk to the rich folks. 
[03:50:30]  Mike in Pittsburgh.  Gentlemen.  Hey there, Mike.  What's up, Mike?  How are things?  Good.  Good.  Great.  Glad to hear it.  I've got a couple of newsworthy things I don't know if you heard about.  There was this guy in Alabama that actually fucked a horse to death.  And it's a true story.  Did you hear that?  Did the horse fuck him to death?  No, he fucked a horse to death.  He fucked a quadruped to death.  I heard something about, I heard that it was a pony, and then I heard a donkey and a 
[03:51:00]  horse, and then I'm hearing that PETA is all up in arms because he was having sex with this  animal, and somehow the animal died.  I don't know if he killed it, or it just died from neglect.  Neglect?  I don't know if he was fucking with it.  I mean, he's not neglecting it.  You know what I mean?  He's giving it some love anyway.  Some love.  Yeah.  Not all neglect.  You had Mr. Cuban on earlier.  Yes.  He seems like a very grounded young man.  He put the offer on the table to fist fight with no implication of litigation, which I didn't 
[03:51:30]  not quite understand.  Oh, shut up.  Wait.  Do you...  Hello, boy.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Did I just...  No, no.  I'm just wondering, how long have you been listening on XM?  Oh, dude.  I have like a delay or some shit.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  No.  I mean, how long have you been listening?  How long have you had XM and listening to the show?  What do you think here?  I'd say...  Take your time.  Four months.  Okay.  Four months.  So, you're not listening to us because you're brand new in Pittsburgh and listening on like 
[03:52:00]  FM and then you decided to listen to XM, right?  Correct.  Okay.  You can cut him off anytime you want.  When did you...  When did you realize you were a bore?  Just about half a minute ago when you really just started talking a lot.  You just let me get in, break in.  No, go ahead, man.  We're just teasing you.  What did you want to say?  Shut up, Jimmy.  Because I'm really embarrassed now.  My penis just shrunk about an inch, but...  That was a bomb.  Let me think here. 
[03:52:30]  Are you guys still there or are you just...  We're here, brother.  We're here.  We're waiting with bated breath.  I love it.  You guys are...  If you put up with me, you have fucking patience.  There's no doubt about it.  So, Cuban, anyway, a lot of people have been dying here in Pittsburgh from heroin overdoses.  And just in his neighborhood where he grew up in Squirrel Hill, a guy just died last night from a heroin overdose.  It's the sixth in...  I mean, it's a smaller city than New York City, granted.  But the sixth death by heroin in one night.  It's pretty crazy. 
[03:53:00]  And I just wanted to say one other thing.  I'd like to get Mark Cuban and the owner of the Pirates, Kevin McClackie, in a phone booth.  Let him fight it out.  Whoever gets out of that phone booth gets the Pirates free and clear.  And I hope Cuban wins.  You know what I mean?  What a douche-ass cock dick.  I can't even find the words. 
[03:53:30]  I can't...  Do you know how bad a quality you have to be when we know you mean well and we still want you to get cancer of the teeth?  Oh.  Is that even possible?  Yes, it is.  You're not accurate anymore.  Big, moist tumors right off the end of his teeth so he can't chew.  I would love it because it would be such a new type that they wouldn't know how to cure it.  Exactly.  And he'd surely perish.  And the doctors would try to cure it, but he'd talk and then fall asleep halfway through his story.  Hey, where's the Don and Mike audio?  We were supposed to play that today.  Let's hope Hawk has it. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, fuck it, Eric.  Hi, this is Shane again.  He's good.  I'm going to sing another song.  This time, karaoke again.  This time it's by Journey, written by Steve Perry.  I got the songbook for it and also the lyrics.  So, here we go.  It's a MIDI version.  It's nice. 
[03:54:30]  He's trying out for Not You Too, or To You, or whatever the hell.  I am beside you, yeah, I am brother.  Who is this?  Feeling your heart beat with mine.  Is it Gene Stapleton?  No.  Softly you whisper, and you're so sincere. 
[03:55:00]  How could our love be so bright?  It's our own Travis song.  We're staying home together.  She's good.  We treat it better, but I'm here.  Oh, picking it up.  You're all by my side.  Here it comes.  Everybody, come on.  So now I want you. 
[03:55:30]  With that heavy, open wallet, open source.  This is someone who really thinks they're good.  This isn't really Travis goofing off? 
[03:56:00]  No.  I thought you were serious.  I know.  No, I wasn't.  Travis is kidding.  The guy named Shane.  Wow.  Somewhere out there.  Should be Shane.  Was this found extra to his body?  Like, he shot himself?  Coagulated blood wrapped around us.  Oh, this is horrid.  Living without you.  Living without you.  Was he singing to his talent?  This empty house seems so good. 
[03:56:30]  Oh.  Wanting to hold you.  One in your near.  Oh, my God.  I want to hold you home.  Oh, my God.  But now as you've come back, turn that into death.  He doesn't even know the words. 
[03:57:00]  Now I need you to stay.  You can tell by the way he's singing that he really thinks he's doing a good job. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow, is that harsh.  I hope you'll see what your love means to me.  This guy should take a journey to the gun store.  Do everyone a favor.  Oh.  That's some good stuff. 
[03:58:00]  Bravo.  That was Up in Arms by Journey, which is in the songbook.  So I'll sign it with permission.  In the songbook.  In the songbook.  That's in the songbook.  All right.  Guy sings so bad, he made my meatballs when I fall off the table.  And I guess that's how we end today.  I hate when Italians get serious.  My mother, God rest his soul. 
[03:58:30]  Hey.  Shut up.  Hey, God bless.  Hey.  All kidding aside, my mother was a saint on earth.  Yeah.  Why is she?  Aren't they all resting?  Exactly.  Peace.  Hey, rest in peace.  You know what I mean?  If you're resting uncomfortably, you're still alive.  Still it's in praise.  Yeah, what soul is not resting?  Let's get right into this discussion.  You're dead.  You're resting.  Period.  Hey, I want to ask Brian Sites for a question.  You've been wanting to say that for 15 minutes.  I just thought of it. 
[03:59:00]  Going to rock this town, are you, shithead?  You've got to come up with...  Inside out.  I have a new mission.  Is the picture up on opianthony.com?  Of you?  And your hair?  No, there's a video up there.  A video.  All right.  Go check out the video of E-Rock's hair on opianthony.com.  And I want to get a list of 100 names for your hair.  Wow. 
[03:59:30]  It looks like he's wearing a wig backwards.  Backwards.  Like you put it on wrong.  So, I mean, what are some of the ones we said today?  Hawaiian Punch.  Hawaiian Punch guy.  Brian Sites are...  Eagle's Nest.  Eagle's Nest.  Ducky.  Ducky.  Something forehead mullet.  Half a mullet.  The guy just comes into work every day.  No matter what his hair looks like, it will always be goosed on. 
[04:00:00]  We've been hazing him for a while, but he's starting to get better, at least.  We love Eric.  Is he?  He just didn't get this whole thing in the beginning, but now I think he's almost there.  Another year of this, E-Rock, and you'll be one of us.  Oh, great.  His hair looks like it actually folds up like the hood of a car.  Like you just lift it.  Do we make a little noise?  That's right.  That fucking head, that hair would look good on a carousel. 
[04:00:30]  Horsemane skull.  Hey, pony hair.  Go fuck yourself.  All right, write that one down.  Who's keeping track of the list?  I want to see a hundred.  I want to see a hundred.  Who's got one?  Come on in, Sam.  Jump on the pile.  Exactly.  Pony hair.  Did we go with tarantula?  Hope someone fucks you to death.  Didn't we go with tarantula head?  Did we?  That's perfect.  Boys life hair.  I mean, come on.  We got ten in the room already. 
[04:01:00]  You forgot hair plugs.  Real hair plugs.  A retarded time of my life to break, to go with my bad hair.  Okay.  Oh, you mean to go with the bad singing?  Is that what you really wrote?  I love the, I love this version.  Have we played that in a while?  Well, and it's almost topical because during the American Idol finale, Taylor Hicks and McPhee sang that.  What's that?  Is that a message from, um, a text or a call? 
[04:01:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Who is it?  Who is it?  Uh, this is Greg.  How are you?  Oh, oh, and it's not Opie.  Good.  It's the actual Greg Hughes.  Is it free?  Uh, I missed my teeth cleaning appointment.  Oops.  That's gonna hurt.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Uh, when, when can we, uh, reschedule?  That'd be bad.  I hope I didn't miss it.  I didn't call to confirm.  They usually do.  Uh, the sooner the better.  I got really bad breath at this point. 
[04:02:00]  Oof.  I don't think usually, uh...  Clean his teeth already, you cunt!  Wednesday, June 14th.  June 14th sucks!  At what time?  That's no good, bitch!  Seven o'clock at what time?  Seven o'clock sucks black cock!  At night?  Seven o'clock at night.  6.30, whore!  That's too late because I, uh, I, uh, go to bed.  He fucks children at five!  Sorry, I got the TV on real loud.

He's not really looking at anything.  That's right.  June 20th?  June 20th is no good!  He's got to jerk off at a Boy Scout meeting!  Nine, ten, or eleven in the morning?  Yeah, I can.  Morning!

[04:03:30]  That was awful.  TV's on a little loud, yeah.  And it's talking to you.  Wow, that TV show is mimicking.  She was, like, in a weird way into it, and then by the end of it, she was very...  How many times can you be called a cunt?  That is the question.  All right, where are we?  All right, so, uh...  Yeah, we're gonna do, uh...  I, uh, have the time of my life or something.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Uh, wanna get the plugs in, uh, any plugs, Anthony? 
[04:04:00]  I got no plugs, what am I doing?  All right, well, Joe's thing?  Uh, just, uh, call up, uh, Joe, if you, uh, Bono, uh, you wanna be, uh, Bono and a front,  uh, front man, and, uh, the U2 band that he has.  All right.  I put that well.  6-3-1, 6-4-2, 7-9-5-5, or email him at edge at not U2.com.  What, Jimmy?  I just caught an anger.  Turn your head to the side a little bit.  No, the other way, bro.  The other way. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  I just caught us on the side when he was looking down.  It's fucking abysmal.  It brought out anger.  People are saying it looks...  You shouldn't go to the back of your, your head.  You know what the, your head looks like?  It looks like, it looks like the roof of a leaf hut.  Like, fucking aborigines should live under your hairline.  A thatch cottage head.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Thatch is a fucking excellent... 
[04:05:00]  Tom, Tom Hanks and Wilson should be fucking living under that awful hair.  Danny's got one?  Can I make fun of Eric, too?  Okay, Dan.  I just wanted to call him the brown awning.  Get out right now.  Okay.  Don't even turn around.  Just back out.  The merengue.  They're loving it in the other room.  Yeah, they always do.  See, they love when anyone messes up, not just E-Rock.  Superfuzz from New York saying,  Fisher-Price, my first haircut.  Brad Smith saying, 
[04:05:30]  he looks like the fucking logo from Baby Einstein.  Little children's videos.  Eric's hair resembled a tangled fishing line.  An upside-down canoe.  It's just horrible.  Oh, boy.  Someone's calling him old wheatgrass head.  Hey, you might want to put a little fucking conditioner or something in that dry hair.  Lean-to head. 
[04:06:00]  They are all coming...  What do you condition your hair with?  Fucking sawdust?  Uh, an electrocuted alfalfa.  Jeez.  Well, they haven't seen the video yet.  Leave old kindling hair alone.  The goal is to get a hundred names for E-Rock's hair.  That's our goal.  You can go to, like, Wack Bag or any of the other websites and start your lists. 
[04:06:30]  Start the list.  And we'll read the better ones on the air tomorrow.  All right?  The new glasses, the new hairdo.  It's a new look.  It's a whole new you.  Change it.  It stinks.  And not to the old you, because that was awful, too.  People are wondering if, uh...  Opie's gonna ask E-Rock if he's got any plugs, and he's just gonna point to his head.  No.  That's right.  My hair will be appearing at the Stress Factory.  Will it? 
[04:07:00]  There you go.  Oh, shit.  Old duvet head.  Hey, tumbleweed skull, what do you got going on later?  Fucking...  Oh, that hair should be blown by a dirt road.  It's bothering everybody.  Oh, God.  Mugshot from PA has, uh...  Eric has hula skirt head. 
[04:07:30]  And John from Kentucky is calling him sling blade.  Head.  Head.  Boy, they are coming in.  Where's my instant feedback?  I think we can get a hundred before we get out of here.  I think.  The next five minutes.  All right.  Let's see.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, well.  All right.  A lot of people have the same one.

Oh, Lost Boys are playing at Brett's Place on Friday.  Actually, really cool band.  On Jimmy Day.  Real cool band, yeah.  That's playing at FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in the fine village of Huntington.  I'll try to get there.  Yeah, Friday night.  They go on about 10. 
[04:09:00]  It's great.  Yeah, they were really good last time around.  So, if you can't make it to Jimmy Day, we'll do a little thing, hopefully, at FH Riley's.  Okay?  My brother's restaurant.  It's a fine, fine place.  Jimmy.  Jimmy Day on Friday.  Are you excited?  Yes.  It's not Jimmy Day, though.  Yes.  Because people are still trying to turn it into Jimmy Day.  There'll be some cool things happening for Jimmy on Friday, but I'm telling you, when we  do Jimmy Day, we've got to do it right.  Now, am I correct in this?  I'm signing my stand-up DVD, which is from HBO, which I've never had a stand-up DVD released,  and we're giving a lot away, right? 
[04:09:30]  XM bought a bunch very generously.  I believe so.  About like 200 or so.  I think there's going to be a lot more than 200 people that show up.  I think we're going to have a nice crowd on Friday.  It's at 6 p.m. at Tower Records on Broadway and 66th Street.  66th Street.  Certain copies of Lucky Louie Pilot I'll be handing out to, and XM was very generous.  Thank you guys for doing that.  Yeah, so what else you got?  We'll see you Friday for Jimmy, and Ant and I will be there while Tower Records is Broadway  and 66th Street.  What's left at the bottom of the Mini Wheats boxed head?

You know what his hair looks like?  One of those old-time pen erasers that will be on the back of your pen. 
[04:10:30]  Let's go to Tim in Tennessee.  Tim.  Yeah, he looks like that Play-Doh doll, and he also has probably got a hair helmet.  Oh, man, you blew it.  Play-Doh head would have worked.  Yeah.  Exactly.  We squeeze his nose and more hair comes out.  Yeah.  Cut it with a dull scissors.  Looks like his hair should be sticking out of the handlebars of a young child's bicycle.  Oh, someone had it.  Oh, okay.  Those little tassels.  Worse than no filter Paul hair. 
[04:11:00]  Let's slow down.  Susan powder hair.  Now, you know what his hair looks like?  Nothing.  You know those little things that made...  Like a duster.  You have duster hair.  Duster.

Why'd you just pump your fists, Eric, like you've ever said anything funny on air?  Oh, wow.  Hey, you guys did that?  What a recovery.  What a recovery.  Whoa.  It's not my job to hog for mic time, Dan.  Oh, you guys did that? 
[04:12:30]  Yeah.  God forbid you add to the radio show, Eric.  God forbid.  Oh, you guys take that.  Whatever.  Exactly.  Oh.  He fucking, uh, he said a lot of people around here don't like when we do hair jokes.  They won't tell him.  I just, no, I just, people that are sensitive about their hair.  Top of Tina Turner's 80s wig head hair.  It's not even the whole head. 
[04:13:00]  It's not the whole head.  That's right.  That's great.  Larry Fishburne should rape you on a console.  Rick from Rhode Island's calling him sea anemone head.  Eric's hair is erupting.  Come on, that's good.  Of course it is.  It must be my delivery on some of these things.  There's so many of them.  You know what his hair looks like?  The flattened wheat in a crop circle.  Arboid Dwyer after the shot head. 
[04:13:30]  Than's last joke hair.  Doesn't look like dog shit.  That's funny.  The start of the growth of a carrot hair.  You've got to grow vegetables in your backyard and then you would get that, I guess.  You just are not stopping them.  First it's all really pushy and then it gets taller.  No. 
[04:14:00]  You've got to leave.  Eric, you're not bothered, right?  Be honest.  You're not really kidding.  He's getting better.  I love it.  Just because it looks like peat moss.  You're almost there.  I give it about a year.  I give it about a year.  They're not going to cut this out of the replay because we went too long, are they?  Lilith Fair performer underarm hair head.  We need a hundred.  We need a hundred.  We'll have them by 11.30.  Yep.  All right. 
[04:14:30]  Oh, my cheeks.  All right.  Yeah, we're out.  All right.  It's done.  Guys, we had a lot of fun today.  Yeah, let's see who's not here tomorrow.  I think we bitched a little too much yesterday, but it couldn't be helped.  We have a good time doing this in the end.  And I hope you guys know that.  What, Danny boy?  Doing it in the end.  Okay.  What happened?  What were you whispering to Broomhead?  Get out of here.  No.  Whisk.  Whisk.  Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.  Why don't we, like, you know, we used to leave dramatically. 
[04:15:00]  Like, it was like, uh, well, tomorrow on the show, boom, this, this, this, and this, and  then, pa-choo, pa-choo, that includes an Opie and Anthony show.  How about this?  Blah, blah, blah.  Tomorrow on the show, money jokes.  All day.  All day.  Now we just kind of leave one by one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, well, I guess that's that.  Here's my juice.  Like, like this.  I gotta take a piss.  Me too, sweetie.  Come on, Jim. 
[04:15:30]  I'm sorry, baby.  Me, you, piss.  Yeah.  Me, you, piss, Betsy.  Ooh, look at all the cash you just pulled out of your pocket.  Dude, I laugh at this cash.  Yeah, that's nothing, right?  I just fucking, I just, I just throw it on the ground to keep people from making eye contact  with me.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  End of the show.  Uh, don't forget, Ron and Fez up at noon, you know.  I thought it was good today, man.  I was on fire.  It really was, though.
