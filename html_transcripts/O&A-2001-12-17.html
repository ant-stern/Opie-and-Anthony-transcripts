<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The December 17th, 2001, Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing their delayed holiday vacation, boasting about high ratings, especially in Buffalo, where they recounted crude jokes and anecdotes about local bars and their neighborhood. They also revisited a tense meeting with Viacom executives regarding their job security.  A substantial portion of the show detailed a disastrous party for listeners from their online message board.  The party was dominated by the erratic and intoxicated behavior of a listener named Lady Di, whose repeated shouting of "Anthony" and disruptive actions, including a physical altercation with another listener, Marion, and the destruction of a snowman costume, were recounted in vivid detail. Numerous callers shared their own experiences from the party, confirming the hosts' stories and adding further accounts of drunken antics and inappropriate behavior. Jim Norton was a guest in the studio, and a vulgar fake commercial for a Jim Norton doll was played. The hosts also discussed excessive drinking at their station's Christmas party, including an incident where an employee, Rick, allegedly suffered temporary deafness in one ear from vomiting.  Vince Neil was scheduled to appear later.  A chance encounter with Mick Foley on a train was also mentioned.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of a previous segment involving vomiting, followed by a conversation about Christmas shopping. Opie expressed his dislike for Christmas, advocating for a Secret Santa exchange within his family to replace their extravagant gift-giving tradition, a change that caused conflict with his mother.  Listener emails detailed a disastrous office Christmas party involving drunkenness and car theft.  The hosts also discussed listener feedback on rebroadcasts of past stunts, including "Sex for Sam 2" and "Homeless Shopping Spree."  Dean called in with a story about childhood vomiting so intense he burst blood vessels in his eyes.  Opie further elaborated on his own self-indulgent shopping habits. Mick Foley then joined the show in studio, announced he was giving away Radio City Christmas Spectacular tickets, and shared his own Christmas-related stories, including a strange encounter on a train. He also mentioned a rumor of a death on that same train.  The conversation included discussion of Tom Green's divorce from Drew Barrymore, criticism of *Freddy Got Fingered*, and a call from a Marine in Quantico, Virginia, expressing support for the show's stance on the Afghanistan war and Osama bin Laden, along with criticism of the press for releasing potentially harmful military information.  The hosts also discussed John Walker Lindh and their opinions on his actions and potential punishment.  The segment concluded with further movie talk and a mention of Blockbuster.

Vince Neil’s appearance was heavily focused on his personal life, including his three divorces, financial success from them, and promiscuous lifestyle. He shared numerous anecdotes about mud wrestling parties, Penthouse magazine shoots at his house, and numerous encounters with women, with frequent references to his autobiography.  Funny moments included his explanations of his marriages (one because the woman had a car, another to a mud wrestler), his description of a "kitty club" backstage involving urination in a sandbox, a listener’s question about whether he slept in a bed after pornographic films were shot there, and numerous discussions of sexual exploits.  The hosts and Neil discussed listener calls about various sexual encounters related to the band. A listener asked about his possible involvement with Pam Anderson, which Neil confirmed ("got banged good").  The segment also included news of the death of the lead singer of Big Country and the creator of Casper the Friendly Ghost.  The show concluded with the hosts planning a new segment, "The Motley Crüe Kitty Litter Box," which involved women using a litter box on air.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show!  Hello!  We are live, I swear to you. How do we prove it, Anthony?  Well, it is December 17th, 2001.  The only radio show in New York live today.  Yeah, why is that?  I guess everyone else has enough confidence in what they're doing and in their ratings to take some time off.  You're pretty confident about your ratings, are you?  Us being the paranoid radio show we are, we figured we'd push it as long as we could. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, we were offered the opportunity to start our vacation today.  And we said, no, we'll hang out a few days.  Kind of get a jump on everyone else that's taken off.  Who else has taken off? Everybody? Is everyone off?  All the high-profile shows, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think we'll make it until about Thursday and then we're going to have to give in, all right?  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  So, we'll do three days this week.  Yeah, well, hey, come on, that's better than most people, right?  Yeah.  A couple phone numbers, Anthony, in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Ben, Vince Neal's on the phone.  Vince.  Vince is coming in today.  Yeah.  And anywhere else in America.  Including.  Including.  Oh, let me.  Our number one syndicated radio station.  Buffalo!  Buffalo, New York! 
[00:01:30]  God damn loving Buffalo, man.  You effers are going to make us fly to Buffalo.  The coldest place on the planet in the middle of the winter.  In the middle of the winter, you guys are going to force us to go there.  Because, my God, are they coming on board.  They are coming on board faster than even Cleveland, my friend.  Yeah.  They are coming on board faster than the people leaving the Washington station.  Right.  Wow, are they?  Perhaps everyone in Washington moved to Buffalo.  Maybe that's what's going on.  And they are digging us. 
[00:02:00]  They just left Washington.  Maybe that's it, Anthony.  But we explained this on Friday.  Washington keeps us humble.  Keeps our heads a nice size, you know.  Just when you think we're getting big heads because we're a syndicated radio show, we have Washington to look at.  Puff Dank wonders if the sports guys will be doing their show then.  Because these are the high profile radio show.  Are they on?  I don't know.  I wasn't up this morning.  That really wasn't a dig at them.  I know.  I wasn't up this morning.  And I'm assuming Ron and Fez are going to do their show as well. 
[00:02:30]  Are they?  I don't know.  All right.  But Buffalo gave us a great, not a good, a great ratings trend.  Yep.  Like we are shooting up fast.  Leaps and bounds.  Thank you, Buffalo.  A Buffalo.  A Buffalo.  Save me a table at Gabriel's Gate.  I'm coming for some drinks and some wings.  Wow.  Local reference.  On Allen Street.  Wow.  Double.  Then we can pick up some 18-year-old girls at the Brick Bar.  Oh. 
[00:03:00]  I don't know if the Brick Bar is still there, Anthony.  Old school.  I used to drink at the Pink Flamingo.  And it wasn't a gay place.  God, can you imagine if it turned into a gay place and now I'm bragging that I used to drink there?  Yeah, that would suck.  You better definitely update your knowledge of local places in some of these markets because, yeah, you don't know.  It might be a glory hole place.  You're talking about how great it is.  Because, you know, we're going back 10 years.  That's when I was living and working in Buffalo.  My neighborhood, though, I did go back last summer. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, it has hit the skids.  Oh, yeah?  Cool little place.  Uh-huh.  Had a nice feel to it.  And now it's just like overgrown sidewalks, you know, abandoned buildings.  Really?  A lot more shwuggies walking around.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Well, the bad kind of shwuggies.  I don't know what that even means.  There's good kind of shwuggies and there's bad kind of shwuggies, right?  Chris Rock taught us that, Anthony.  I'm not saying anything that hasn't been discussed out there.  Boys, don't use my word.  Shwuggie. 
[00:04:00]  Shwuggie means nothing, right?  Of course.  But, yeah, there you have it.  Buffalo with just an incredible rating strength.  Scary.  I mean, scary ratings.  They definitely came on board.  Thank you, Buffalo.  Top three cities that we're syndicated to?  Yeah.  Philly?  Yeah.  Cleveland?  Uh-huh.  Buffalo.  Look at that.  Buffalo in the top spot.  Look at that.  I don't even see Boston in the top three yet.  No.  No.  They prefer fake radio in Boston. 
[00:04:30]  Well, it's going to take a little more time.  For some reason.  They're still enjoying it.  It's hard for them to pull themselves away from fake radio.  I think reality, it hits them between the eyes a little too hard.  So they want to stick as long as they can to bad, fake weddings, bad, fake, pick your sidekick contests, bad, fake, I stole these tickets from my boss's office and you can win them.  So you want to sit there and enjoy that for a while.  We'll give you more time. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Now, Buffalo, they've had a lot of fake radio.  Yeah.  And they're realizing, okay, that stuff is over with, over and done with.  Uh-huh.  I like the real kind of radio.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go right to the phones, Anthony.  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Are you sure that maybe you're not having flashbacks from last year vacation at this time?  Maybe that's why you're not going away yet?  Ooh.  A little bit of fear effect, a little bit of chilling to feet, maybe?  Well, last year we did go on vacation, and this is the God's honest truth.  We really weren't sure we were ever coming back. 
[00:05:30]  Yep.  I remember.  And I think the only reason we did come back was because we had really good ratings.  To this day, I think that's the only reason that they didn't fire us at the time.  The only reason we're still here.  Because, after all, it is a business, and we were bringing in some nice numbers for them.  Well, when you meet with the head of the company, and now the head of Viacom, sit across the table from Mel, man, that's a little rough.  And he asks you, do you wake up every morning and ask yourself, how am I going to F with? 
[00:06:00]  How are you going to F, Mel?  Do you do that?  Do you wake up every morning and say to yourself, how am I going to F, Mel?  And when you're sitting there in that situation, there's no answer.  There's no answer.  There's no, you're not sitting there going, oh, this is good.  I'm meeting the big boss.  You're sitting there going, all right, hopefully we got enough of our material that we can send out with our resume.  Like you're going over how you're going to get another job in your head.  Yeah.  That's all I was hearing. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'm glad you guys made it back, and have a great holiday, boys.  Thanks, John.  We're going to have a great year coming up.  But it's funny you mention that, John.  You're kind of right, because there's been a few meetings, let's just say, in the back office where we wanted to push the envelope on a few things.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting there begging everyone.  And I'm like, and I'm the sane one, finally.  And I'm begging everyone going, you know, come on, guys.  Let's just go away on vacation and feel like, okay, we can come back and we'll have our jobs after the holiday. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, not worry about it.  There are a couple bit ideas we came up with.  I'm like, dude, do you want to worry about this during Christmas and New Year's?  I know.  I wonder if they're going to fire us.  Yeah, it's scary when Opie's the sane one.  It switches depending on the day.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Yeah, that was rough last year, sitting through that.  And one of these days, that'll all come out in a book or something.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:07:30]  Someday it will.  Yeah, it definitely will.  Someday it abso-effing-lutely will.  Plenty on top.  What's up?  Plenty on top wants to come in today.  I would guarantee, too, you'd thumb through the book.  And you would literally crap yourself with some of the stuff that I would love to discuss.  You will just crap.  You'll go, oh, my God, I was reading.  I got to, like, page 105, and I dumped in my pants because I could not believe what I just read. 
[00:08:00]  All right.  Joe from Buffalo wants to say hi.  Joe, what's going on?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's going on, guys?  What's going on, man?  I am a lucky man.  In between Buffalo and Rochester, I get a double dose of O&A every day.  Oh, cool.  Hey, is it snowing up there yet?  Not yet.  We got some rain, but...  You guys have had a lucky, lucky winter so far.  Oh, yeah.  By now, don't you have, like, 10 feet of snow on the ground?  Last year, the first week of November, there were people stuck in Buffalo on the road for three days.  Three days, yeah.  And no snow.  For the first time in recorded history, you guys have no snow in November. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  But, hey, you guys know it's cold up here, but you've got to remember, we can jump across  the border, and it's warm over there with the women.  Yeah, well, the...  You guys like strip clubs.  Canada's got some of the best.  Well, the Canadian Ballet, sure.  I didn't see a good one.  Another local reference has the Canadian Ballet.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.  I saw, mine looked like a Yankee Cranky, Yankee Cranky shop, the one I went to.  No, the Canadian Ballet is nice.  I was looking for American girls.  I walked in.  I swear to God, it was a scene out of Saigon that was going on in there. 
[00:09:00]  I saw not one American woman, totally nude, they say, right?  I see a bunch of women dancing around with underwear on and whatnot, and then one girl  comes out.  She does a dance.  She gets, you know, totally nude and then leaves the stage.  And it was, you know, it's all very good.  You want bang, bang?  Well, the Asians like their Canada, Anthony.  I guess so, but it was kind of disappointing.  Everyone talks so highly of the Canadian strip clubs. 
[00:09:30]  Well, when we go up there to Buffalo, we'll have to make the trip, okay?  Yeah.  All right, Joe, thank you.  All right, man.  Go Bills.  You hung up on that, I know.  Pat's kicked the Bills' ass over the weekend.  Boy, it's coming down to the nitty-gritty, huh?  And the Jets finally won a game in December, so I'm very happy.  Jets still in it?  Pats?  What are they, a half game behind the Pats?  Pats are ahead of the Jets now?  Very close. 
[00:10:00]  I hate that.  I would really, I will be upset if Ben's team, the Pats, get in there.  Why?  Over the Jets.  Why?  Well, I'm not going to fake it.  When Massachusetts has a fake football team, I'll root for them.  Just like they root for fake radio shows.  That's why.  You're obsessed with this fake radio thing today.  Well, I just, I see Boston as, they're a little slow.  A little slow.  So, you know, they got to, they got to hang out with the fake stuff. 
[00:10:30]  Did you have a bad weekend?  It's easier for them to accept.  Dude, you want to hear about my friggin' weekend?  That Saturday night party at Bar 9?  A bunch of the message board people from opanthony.com?  Lady Di and Marion show up.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I got to say, Marion at least, she was sober.  She was making as much sense as she does on a regular basis, which is very little, 
[00:11:00]  but at least she was sober.  Why do they give us a Christmas card with cash in it?  That's another thing.  What?  Dude.  They're mental.  Lady Di, for some reason, she wrote Marion in the card,  because Marion goes, I didn't, you know, that was Lady Di's money.  So, at Bar 9, Saturday, she's hammered drunk.  Hammered.  More drunk than you've seen many of your college buddies.  That's how drunk.  Drunker than I saw Rick when I got back here after the Regan show. 
[00:11:30]  We will get into that.  Yeah, we will.  All I want to know is if my ass is safe around here today.  Around us, Steve.  And I want to know if you can go deaf from puking.  You'll have to get that question answered.  We'll get into the Christmas party after the break.  A lot of ass-grabbing.  Yeah.  People going deaf.  Some prom was at our Christmas party.  People dressed up in prom wear.  Prom outfits.  But go ahead. 
[00:12:00]  But Lady Di is there with Marion.  Bunch of people.  This isn't the Christmas party, by the way.  No, no.  This is down at Bar 9 for the message board.  And she is the most annoying human being on the face of the earth.  I swear to you, there were at least 50 people at any given moment that wanted to plant the flat part of their fist in her face harder than they would punch Bin Laden if they saw him.  That's how annoying.  And that isn't even how annoying she was. 
[00:12:30]  She's right at the front of the stage the whole night.  And me and Joe are like, we're hashing stuff out.  What do you want to do?  You know, it's very thrown together.  We don't care.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Dude.  A thousand times.  You've got to keep doing it until you annoy the listeners because that's how bad it is.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  She's right up front.  So I would phase her out for a little bit because I'm singing.  And then we'd get done with the song.  I'd start talking to Joe.  We're talking to a mic or somebody.  And I'd hear Anthony.  And I turn because I hear my name.  And I look.  And it's that frigging bitch again.  She got me again.  20,000 times.  I would turn because I'd hear my name.  And I go.  Would you shut up?  F up.  F up.  I was cursing like crazy. 
[00:13:30]  She wouldn't shut up.  She got drunker and drunker and drunker.  Then my brother who does great covers of Hendrix.  Guitar.  Unbelievable.  Sounds like Hendrix.  Gets up there.  I think he's doing Castles Made of Sand.  Mary.  Lady Di comes stumbling up on the stage.  While he's just jamming?  While he's singing and playing.  But, you know, it's only him on the mic.  And there's other mics up there.  She grabs one of the mics.  Now I got sand in the sea. 
[00:14:00]  Eventually.  Castles.  Joe stops in the middle of the song.  He goes.  Would you get your fat effing ass off this effing stage before I punch you?  Now, at this point, Marion realizes Di has had it.  And people want to kill her.  She gets up on the stage.  Grabs Lady Di.  Pushes her.  Punches her in the head.  And starts kicking her down the stairs.  She's planting her foot in her ass. 
[00:14:30]  Kicking.  It was a troll fight.  It was great.  It looked like two creatures from EverQuest battling.  I swear to you.  Marion was getting experience points.  It was amazing.  And she's kicking her ass.  And it all.  I can't even convey how annoying this piece of crap is.  Because every two seconds she's going.  And then she's like.  Find me.  And grab me.  And go.  I gave you $50. 
[00:15:00]  I gave you $50.  I was like.  Why?  She sent a card.  With $50 in it.  I got $49.  Oh, there you go.  I was like.  Why are you giving me money?  Lots of.  Mine was all crumpled.  The hard cabbage, too.  She gives money.  So she can tell me 80 friggin' times that.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  I gave you $50.  I gave you $50.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony. 
[00:15:30]  Anthony.  Shut up.  You.  You.  Hunt.  You hunt.  You effing hunt.  You are a hunt.  What's a hunt?  It's.  You know what it is.  No, I don't.  Glenn.  What's up?  I know what it is.  It means.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, Opie.  That's what it means.  I went to the party Saturday and I saw one of the.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh.  Sorry.  No, no, no. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Well, thanks, Len, for reminding me.  I'll let you know what happened here.  I'm sending you the picture.  That's good.  I hope everybody has pictures.  Of what?  Lady Di.  At one point, a huge snowman costume, you know, like you see him waving on the street corner  or something.  Then snowman and a reindeer, two people in costume, come in and they're dancing around  the dance floor.  Drunken, disgusting, Anthony, Anthony, I gave you $50 bag, says, walks up to the snowman 
[00:16:30]  and starts filleting the snowman's carrot nose.  Ugh.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Like the disgusting piece of rag.  She is.  All right.  All right, man.  Jesus.  Love this beep.  Yeah, but I hear the real thing.  Get it out.  Well, beep her.  I went up at one point.  I said, I said, Lady Di, I wouldn't beep you with your beep. 
[00:17:00]  Nice.  Awful.  Nice.  Can I?  That's a good idea.  West Coast Dave.  I should donate the money to the American Retarded Foundation so it would help her out.  All right.  Well, we should take our first break and then we got to get into the Christmas party.  God, is she annoying.  We should play.  And then, oh, okay, before, I forgot the grand finale.  She's walking, finally, at about 3.30 in the morning, I turn to Mary and I go, get that 
[00:17:30]  bitch out of here.  She is effing up my whole night.  I'm disgusted.  She disgusts me.  She's always drunk.  And I was like, you know, it sounds like a goddamn troubled husband talking about a wife.  I said, if she was the hottest bitch in the world, picture the hottest girl in the world,  all right, and she looked like that and was attached to your junk by her face 24 hours 
[00:18:00]  a day, it still wouldn't be worth how annoying she is.  Wow.  And that coupled with what a pig she is.  So she's leaving.  Marion's finally shoving her out the door.  Some smartass puts his foot out from a barstool.  She flops flat on her big, fat face.  Went down.  Down.  Did she look like a turtle trying to get back up?  Even that has more finesse. 
[00:18:30]  So a bouncer just grabs her, lifts her up, and flings her out the door.  That was the last we saw her the whole night.  That's funny.  OA Swallow wants in on this.  OA Swallow.  Hey, man.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  It was a great party.  I tell you, when she did that bit with the carrot on that snowman, I mean, I'm an old man.  I've been around.  I've seen everything.  Nothing made me lose my lunch like that.  It was horrible.  It was disgusting.  She's hobbing the snowman's carrot nose like a disgusting slob. 
[00:19:00]  Are there pictures of this?  Oh, yeah.  People are taking video and pictures.  I want it all.  It's going up on the website.  You see what I...  So you people have to live through it, too.  And this guy from San Francisco, he keeps putting Marion.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  It was Lady Di.  It was Lady Di.  Marion was actually the sane one that was trying to get her out of there.  But she's so tanked.  Then Marion's like, you know, this is what she's like.  Sometimes I call up when I got home from work on a weekday, and she's already drunk.  Yeah.  I had a two-hour drive home that night, and I had to see that vision all the way home. 
[00:19:30]  All the way home.  All right, man.  It was horrible.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  You want to play guess which person of the Opie and Anthony show grabbed my ass 20 times at the Christmas party, Anthony?  Male or female?  He seems very...  He.  He seems very embarrassed today.  He hasn't said hi yet.  I know, because I saw him in the garage, too.  All right, we'll get into some of the things that happened at the Christmas party. 
[00:20:00]  I hate Christmas parties, man.  They give people an excuse to just get really wasted and make fools of themselves.  I like that.  You didn't have anyone grabbing your ass.  No.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Did you hear your commercial for the Jim Norton doll?  I didn't hear it.  Steve played it for me over the phone, which I really enjoyed.  We're going to play this before we take a break.  So check this out, and we'll get into some really good stuff today.  Vince Neil coming in.  Lots of strippers, I believe.  And we are live. 
[00:20:30]  What's the date again?  Just a minute.  Yes, it is the 17th of December.  Look at us on Monday.  2001, Anthony.  Right.  Okay.  We'll be back.  Jim Norton fake doll commercial or whatever.  Hey kids, just in time for Christmas, it's the Jim Norton talking doll.  Die.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show, and you've probably seen him receiving yellow  discipline in cheap motels.  Shut up, stupid.  Now you can bring him home.  Just squeeze his mule and let the sparks fly.  Don't try to make a poignant statement, you ass. 
[00:21:00]  Made entirely of recycled rubbers and stuffed with nails and broken glass, the talking Jim Norton  doll is fun for everyone in the family, even mom.  Just keep filleting your husband until he pays the bills.  Oh, that Jim.  What will he say next?  You talk like a foghorn leghorn.  Shut up.  It's an educational toy, too.  Who better to learn about the birds and the bees than from Uncle Jim?  It's not rape if they blink twice for yes.  Comes complete with martini glass, shaker, and vial of urine, some assembly required. 
[00:21:30]  Shut your yass.  New from Stinko, it's the Jim Norton talking doll.  You stink.  Available where Megan's Law doesn't apply.  F***ing yeah.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and I'll see you at the 9th.  I forgot what year I was in there.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and I'll see you at...  I was first just going to be crazy.  It's supposed to say my name.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  No, she's going to insert something.  W-w-w-4. 
[00:22:00]  F***ing nuts this morning.  I'm getting a f***ing book to read.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to...  What's that?  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to...  O.P. and Anthony on the rock stage.  Hi, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Hanging with all our buddies today.  Jim Norton in the studio.  He's up to 10 days without a cigarette. 
[00:22:30]  Nice.  Ever since our cancer show, he gave it up.  Cold turkey.  Good job.  I thought for sure you'd be back on the books.  No, and Keith Robinson keeps screaming at me that I'm going to go back, but I can't.  Anthony's disgusted.  Just throw him out.  Just throw him out.  I'm a motivating factor.  Like, I don't care if anyone smokes.  I'm not, like, bashing stinky or anything, you know?  Hey, you want to smoke?  Smoke.  But I can't stand when people then say they're going to quit, and then, like, they just don't quit.  It's like, you know, anytime I'm smoking, it's like, hey, I like smoking. 
[00:23:00]  I love it.  It's fun.  It makes you look cool.  Now, kids, give it a try.  That and booze and drugs.  But then when you stop, you can't, well, I'm going to cut down until I stop.  You just, you take it, you crumble them up, and you stop.  Period.  And then you get a patch.  I have a patch.  You must be losing it.  No.  You're the most addictive person on this radio show.  I really am hooked on anything that removes me from myself. 
[00:23:30]  Anything.  Anything, really?  Yeah, anything that causes me to not have to look at my face in the mirror and realize that my mouth...  You can't say that.  I'm sorry.  Your mouth looks like a pigeon to a pigeon's C word.  And how would you know that?  Little thin lips.  Yeah, I do have little thin livery.  Turn your head sideways.  No, I mean this way.  So it's up.  Your mouth is up and down.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  Wow.  I'm sure a male bird perching on my chin.  Just enjoying the little thin Irish lips. 
[00:24:00]  Cass, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hi, Jim.  Hello.  So I got a little story for you guys about Saturday night at Bar 9.  I'm such a gossip, but...  Well, this would be the opanthony.com message party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Weekend.  Yes.  And so Lady Di and Marion cornered me in the bathroom.  Yeah.  And they're both barking at me, and they're just talking and talking.  And they mentioned Patty. 
[00:24:30]  Stalker Patty, yeah.  Yeah.  And they're like, well, what do you think of Stalker Patty?  You know?  And I said, oh, I love Patty.  She's great.  Blah, blah, blah.  And they both rolled their eyes, and they started saying...  They were just talking smack.  I don't remember exactly what they said.  Yeah, because they want to be like the big stars.  Yeah.  Oh.  Wow, the stalker's going at it.  That's what I thought.  God damn.  Pathetic.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  Yeah.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  So they were bad-mouthing Patty in the bathroom. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  They were disgusting.  And it's horrible of me to, you know...  That's all right.  Nice showing your cans there Saturday night for the crowd.  I was there at 7.  Started drinking at 7.  Well, you were still 10 billion times better than that slob lady Di was.  Oh, thank you.  I don't even remember how I got home.  I'm sure she doesn't either.  Did you check yourself for any DNA?  If a girl doesn't know how she got home, probably...  No, no, no.  I had Tracy with me.  Yeah? 
[00:25:30]  I had my girl with me, so...  There you go.  All right.  You know, she holds my hair back when I puke.  She gets me home when I need, you know...  Isn't that a good friend?  That's a good friend.  Yeah.  It was a great time, so...  All right, Cass.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Email coming in from Brother Joe, Anthony.  Yeah.  This just in from Lady Di via email.  All right.  So I guess Lady Di has sent Brother Joe an email.  Hey, Joey, it's me, Lady Di.  I just wanted to tell you that I feel so bad about my behavior last night at Bar 9.  I had a little too much to drink, and I got carried away.  Again, I have to say that I'm so sorry, but I hope everyone had a good time anyway. 
[00:26:00]  By the way, you guys sounded great.  I was still celebrating my divorce, and I still feel like an idiot for having too much to drink.  I'm sorry.  Have a nice holiday.  Tell Anthony the same.  Lady Di.  Liar!  Liar!  Don't even try to apologize.  Well, the divorce was final, Anthony, for Lady Di.  Thank God for whoever was married to that.  Yep.  He should be celebrating.  So I'm sure he would have been like 20 times more drunk celebrating not having to deal with that. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  Ugh.  All right, so we had a Christmas party on Friday.  Yeah, Friday we had the company party.  Yeah.  The N.E.W. here in New York, Christmas party.  And I left a little early.  I missed a lot of people getting really drunk because I went to go see the Regan brothers.  The Regan brothers, right.  Very funny.  Dennis Regan killed on Letterman, by the way.  Did he?  Wow, yeah, he did a great job. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, very funny couple of guys.  And I missed.  But then I came back here to get some of my stuff back at the station.  And I bumped into Opie and Rick.  And downstairs I bumped into Steve C.  Holy ass Steve C.  I swear to God.  Thank God there were girls driving for you.  For you guys.  Rick never so drunk.  I've never seen Rick so drunk in all the time I've known you.  Staggering.  Well, they got into some shot wars, Anthony. 
[00:27:30]  The shots were flying at this point.  I didn't even notice Rick was really drunk at first because I wasn't talking to him.  But my girlfriend talked to you for a couple of seconds.  She turned to me and goes, you've got to talk to Rick.  It's hysterical.  So I was like, oh, okay.  Hey, Rick, how you doing?  How you doing?  Thank you, John.  I'm so drunk.  You were gone, man.  He was so gone.  He was puking when he got home to the point that he's now deaf.  He lost his...  Yeah.  Is that true, Rush Limbaugh?  My left ear is clogged from the violent seizures that I was having in the back. 
[00:28:00]  That's what happened to Rush Limbaugh.  So I haven't been able to hear anything since Friday night when I got home.  You puked yourself deaf.  Yeah.  In one ear.  That's great.  It's still...  You can't hear out of the left ear?  I can barely hear any...  It's like if I go like this...  Are you going to go to a doctor soon?  It should have cleared up by now.  It should have cleared up by now.  You know what that is?  It's the pressure.  Yeah.  You get like your...  That whole crap all is connected.  Dude, I've never heard of someone losing hearing in an ear from puking.  Ear, nose, and throat. 
[00:28:30]  Ear, whatever.  I've never heard of it before.  You've got a tube that goes from your throat to your ear.  Well, it's got vomiting.  And it equalizes the pressure behind your eardrum.  And if you puke hard enough, you could send some crap up that tube.  Oh, God, it's that disgusting.  This is the kind of talk that is setting our ratings on fire in Buffalo.  Yes, Buffalo.  You puke up there, right?  Hello, the Rush Limbaugh Excellence in Broadcasting Network. 
[00:29:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was puking last night.  And I believe that is why I am deaf today.  I believe it was a vast democratic conspiracy that made me puke myself deaf.  Oh, wait.  I can't hear again.  I can't hear from a second and talk normal, but I can't mouth. 
[00:29:30]  What?  You went where?  No, no.  Hello, caller.  No, that's the song, right?  Short down like the pretending.  That's the theme song.  It never gets to that point, though, when you're doing a radio show.  Of course not.  But you didn't know when to turn it off, so it...  What?  Played out there.  Caller, you're on there, but my memo.  All right, so Rick lost part of his hearing from drinking so much Friday night, and Steve  likes my butt.  Steve likes everybody's butt.  I was like, I enjoyed everybody's butt.  Please, please someone tell me that I wasn't the only one getting violated by Steve from 
[00:30:00]  foundrymusic.com.  Who else was getting their ass pinched?  Everyone.  Ben, you're...  Okay, I don't feel too bad.  Oh, no, no.  You weren't singled out.  I just...  Dude, you pinched my ass 30 times.  He wasn't singled out, too, but you were incessant on him.  He was talking to the...  Opal was sitting down, having, like, a serious radio conversation with the sports guys.  No, I was talking about Buffalo Radio with the sports guys.  I was in heaven.  And I'm sitting across from him.  Here comes Steve.  And so, once as a joke, he pinches you, and you thought I did it, but then he just 
[00:30:30]  continued laughing, and then he started ticking at your hair, and you started getting  really pissed.  I was licking his head?  Yes.  I was getting so mad.  I remember at one point you told me you were going to punch me, or something to that  effect.  Well, this...  Did you just...  Chuckle?  I was laughing when I saw it.  Yeah, you're going to punch me.  I know, Pete.  Well, this is the problem.  Unless they flood this place with 60 feet of water, I don't think you got much of a shot  against Steve C.  That's why I fully believe that you should be able to carry a firearm.  You want a shot, Steve?  What else am I going to do? 
[00:31:00]  How much do you weigh, even though you lost about 60 pounds already on your operation?  Around 295, 300.  Oh, let's call it 300.  That's almost two of me.  What the F am I going to do if you wanted to have your way with me in the goddamn bathroom?  Well, nothing.  Hey, keep the fantasies out of this.  Just keep it to reality.  Well, the reality is the guy's pinching my ass over and over again, and there's nothing  I can do about it.  Nothing.  Earl, you have something to add to bring this show to a screeching halt?  He got me three times. 
[00:31:30]  He's pinched your ass, too?  Yeah, and he just started giggling.  I was like, I've got to find out who he pinched his ass.  Why are you pinching guys' ass?  Yeah, and he was so proud of it when I saw him in the garage.  I don't even remember it.  He said, I was pinching everyone's ass.  I'm like, oh, fantastic.  And he rode home with his hand out the window for two hours.  You know what it is?  At least this is how I justified it at the time.  Sometimes you're in a group of people, and there's a huge crowd around, and you just  slide a hand in, and you want to blame it on somebody else.  Dude, it was so hard.  Really?  I know, I know, I know.  But I was plastered, and I guess I was just almost knocking people over. 
[00:32:00]  I was doing it so hard.  I was thinking to myself, this must be what it would be like to be in prison.  There's nothing I could do.  Hey, how are you doing?  There's nothing I could do.  Shower.  Yeah.  Bend over.  What am I going to do?  Nothing.  He'd have his way with you.  At one point, you asked me if I wanted to brawl with someone, and I said, well, hold  on.  Just let me wait until my chick gets here, and then we can fight.  You did say that, and the sad part is I wasn't even drunk.  That's how I am.  That's just how I am.  I should carry a stun gun. 
[00:32:30]  TJ's right on line nine.  What else am I going to do?  Stun gun.  Just stun Steve.  Next thing, he could have started grabbing my you-know-what.  What am I going to do?  What am I going to do?  Maybe pick up a chair and try to knock him out that way.  You just yell.  But I know I only have one shot at it.  You got to yell real loud.  Quit pinching my ass.  It's like, Steve, Steve, stop grabbing my C, or something like that.  You know?  And then there's a little embarrassment back there.  Everyone turns their heads, and maybe then he leaves you alone.  How does someone get out of that?  Seriously.  He's almost twice as big as me. 
[00:33:00]  He can do whatever the F he wants, basically.  Survival of the fittest.  Stay back and enjoy it.  Yeah.  At that point, you should just lay back and enjoy it.  Those skilled computer fingers.  Hey, I heard he also got Jeremy, too.  Did I?  Really?  You were squeezing his ass?  I don't think so.  How many guys did you pinch, Steve?  I don't remember.  Dude, I was doing shots, and I had no food in my system, too.  So, that just compounded it all.  I don't remember.  It's like a bathhouse.  I think Megan had to carry me down the stairs into a cab.  I don't really remember.  What's harder to get into, Foundry Music or Opie? 
[00:33:30]  You dick.  Debbie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  Yeah, I have a theory as to why Steve is gay.  All right.  Go ahead.  A theory?  Steve, you're a heavyset man at one point.  You're starting to lose weight.  Do you think that maybe you gained weight because you want to make yourself unattractive to women?  And now that you're losing weight, you're starting to hit on guys.  Wow.  The gay Steve C. theory. 
[00:34:00]  Insightful, but no.  Are you crazy?  I think you're wrong.  He's a big huggy bear.  How much do you weigh, Debbie?  I grabbed Mary's butt, too.  Who?  I'm a completely heterosexual move.  Grab Mary's butt.  Wow.  You grabbed Mary's butt once and all the guys in the room about 100 times if we add it up.  20 for me, easily.  Ben, how many times for you?  At least five.  At least five.  Three on Earl.  Steve.  We're up to 28 inches already.  One on Jeremy.  That's 29.  Who'd you think Mary was, Rick? 
[00:34:30]  Maybe.  Thank you, Debbie.  No problem.  Definitely.  All right.  The Lewis.  Lewis.  Dude, you've got to get Opie a rape whistle.  Whoa.  Hey, Lewis.  Hey, Lewis.  Hey, Lewis.  Lewis, hang up now.  I'm going to hang up before he gets annoying.  Wow.  Lewis actually mildly entertaining that call.  We usually hate Lewis.  He did very well there.  Very nice.  I need a rape whistle around you, Steve.  And the whole time I'm looking, I'm like, there's nothing I could do.  There's nothing I could do. 
[00:35:00]  He popped off on some pinball game.  Here's how the rest of the world justifies it.  Steve is gay.  That's from West.  Well hung in New Orleans.  Yeah.  Check it in.  And if he shaved, he would look like that guard from Midnight Express.  The one that got the coat peg in the back of his head.  Beating the bottom of Opie's feet in the jail cell.  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  All right. 
[00:35:30]  Boy, you guys tanked.  To Steve's defense, no one.  There's no defense tonight.  No, no, no.  In comparison, there was no one closely as drunk as John, our intern.  There was no one in the same list.  This is when I left.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  But that doesn't help out Steve.  Well, I mean, he was sober enough to know what he was doing.  Dude, he was drunk and he was, you know, harassing people.  People are starting to figure out what the C in Steve C means by C.  Oh, boy.  And what you don't realize, and this is, I know what happened, 
[00:36:00]  is the reason Rick's ear is messed up is because Steve leaned in and bit it  and said, are you really a peeler?  Ow.  Ouch.  What were you going to say, Anthony?  I was saying the thing that started it, right when I left,  I did one shot before I left, and I just saw a roller coaster of shots  coming down the bar.  And I had just, I was leaving.  I was kind of bummed.  But John, the intern, he bought the first round.  He was all proud of himself. 
[00:36:30]  He pulls his cash out.  He's buying everyone's shots.  I'm standing there with Sticky Jägermeister while he tries to sort out  who needs drink.  I hate that, by the way.  When you get shots for someone, don't hand them out as the bartender gives them to you.  They've got to wait and leave them all on the bar and then hand them out all at once.  Because you look like the dope.  You're holding your shot waiting for everybody else.  You can't stand there holding it.  Because first of all, you're being bounced around.  You end up with half a shot.  That's funny.  And it's all over your hand.  So true.  Yeah, the guy, he was kind of cute.  He wanted to buy everyone's shots.  So he's handing them out.  And...  He was mad because...  What happened, Mary? 
[00:37:00]  He was getting mad because a couple of people, I don't remember because I was really drunk  at that point.  Yeah, everyone was.  Kept calling people over.  Hey, you want a free shot?  Come on over here.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, it started out with like five of us.  He was going to buy five of his shots.  There had to be 10 or 11 people there going, yeah, John's buying shots.  He's like, I don't make that much.  Yeah, I think we spent all his money.  Yeah, on boost.  So he's slamming shots.  And when I did one, someone else had bought him another one.  He had...  I set him up.  I screwed him.  Three shots in one shot.  Ben has the sickest sense of humor in the whole show. 
[00:37:30]  I saw him weaving when I left.  Yeah.  This was hours before the party ended.  I, myself and AJ from the morning show, completely set John up.  Like, John, you got to be the man.  This is your first Christmas party.  You got to just drink, drink, drink.  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, woo!  He did at least 10 shots in 20 to 25 minutes.  Gone.  And when he left, he tripped over his own legs putting his jacket on.  I don't even know how he did.  And then he called...  I called him on Saturday.  See how I was feeling?  I called him at 11 in the morning.  He called me back at 7.30.  And he's like, oh, yeah, I feel fine.  Nothing...  Not too bad at all. 
[00:38:00]  He's full of crap.  There's no way he could have felt good.  Ha, ha, ha.  Everyone tanked.  Even, uh...  I noticed a little bit of a buzz on our own Ken Stevens.  Oh, Ken was buying shots.  The boss at the, uh...  Ken was rocking and rolling.  You know, super GM Ken Stevens.  Super GM.  I finagled his American Express card out of him to buy a round of shots.  Around the 12.  Oh, is that where it came from?  Steve, did you pinch his ass?  Did you pinch Ken Stevens' ass?  I don't remember.  That's the guy you need to pinch...  You know, you need to pinch his ass.  You need to pinch his ass.  You gotta tap that ass. 
[00:38:30]  God, I hope so then.  Next thing you know, you're gonna get a nice big raise.  We were laughing because we were standing by watching Ken talking to a couple of people.  It was me, my girlfriend, and your girlfriend, Sandy.  And we're talking, and we were laughing at the person that ends up being the guy that's  left out alone because the conversation left him.  So we're looking, and Ken, there was a crowd around Ken, about four or five people, and  it dwindled down to one woman who was talking to Ken.  And I go, look, he's gonna be the guy. 
[00:39:00]  And the girl walked away, and there was lonely Ken Stevens with his drink in his hand just  standing there looking around, like, where can I go, or what conversation can I get  into?  And then he started coming towards us, and we slowly started moving away, just so he'd  have to be the guy for longer.  Was that the prom girl?  Yeah, and then we had people there that, I don't know, we think they were going to a  prom after our party, dressed in, like, prom dresses and stuff.  John the intern.  John.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm still freaking recovering.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:30]  Ben, you...  A party guy like you?  Oh, dude, I got sick three times on the way home.  It was the most awful thing ever.  I almost fell down that long flight of stairs.  Did you puke yourself deaf, though?  Uh, no, I did not.  Puked himself deaf.  I had the good sense to open the cab door.  I puked out the cab door on the train.  It was so bad.  Jeez.  You puked on the train?  You were the guy, huh?  I was the drunk guy on the train that was stumbling into the train bathroom.  Oh, you made it to the bathroom, though?  Yeah, I did.  Well, it permeates to that whole car.  Yeah, it does, but I've seen a lot worse, man. 
[00:40:00]  Uh, coming home from concerts at the garden when I used to live in Long Island, and you'd  get, uh, the guy that would just puke on three seats.  Yeah.  That splash.  Nothing to muffle the sound on the train.  You hear that splash of projectile vomit.  That was...  The worst part is I had to go home by myself, so I was just the drunk guy on the train.  You got to be used to that, John, right?  Well, yeah.  I'm kidding.  Stop it.  I know.  No, it was, I puked on the train, and then I was sitting by myself on the train platform  just puking until I was ready to walk. 
[00:40:30]  I, I, there were four shots lined up at me at one time, did them all, did three shots  at one time.  That was all Ben's doing, by the way.  All different stuff, or were you drinking the same thing?  Oh, yeah.  No, it was a mission.  Yeah.  Soco and lime.  Ugh.  I can't even smell that ever again.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Let me get the chills out of my spine.  That's not a...  I did a...  I did one of those.  That's not a bad shot.  Yeah.  Soco and lime?  Yeah, because I don't like the Southern Comfort, but I like the Soco and lime.  The best, though, at one point, John was cornered all our girls, Megan, Linda, and a  few of them, and he's just sitting there going, you know, I think the guys like me. 
[00:41:00]  I'm pretty sure.  I mean, it's just for the show, right, that they roof on me, but I think they like me.  I mean, you know, I think they like me.  I don't want to be the next bad.  We hear that speech from every intern that comes through those doors.  Yeah.  Well, I'm no different then, I guess.  And I drank Sandy's wine, too, by mistake.  I just saw a glass of wine sitting on the table, and I just...  You were the guy that had to drink everything.  Like in Caddyshack?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The Smales kids walking around, and he gets the one with the cigarette butt, blah, and  then pukes through the sunroof of the porch.  I was mortified the next morning, and I'm trying to go through what the hell I could have 
[00:41:30]  done, and the only thing I came up with was I drank Sandy's wine, and I felt so stupid.  John, what about talking to Jeremy about your show and programming ideas?  Uh-oh.  Really?  What were some of his ideas, guys?  He...  He...  When I...  I actually set him up...  Do you sure dressing?  Do you sure dressing?  I screwed all the girls over and put John over there, and I was like, sit with them and  talk to them.  They were all horrified.  That was when I was with you.  But then I told Jeremy that John had some brilliant weekend show ideas, and John, you 
[00:42:00]  started telling them about some indie rock show or something.  I don't even think you even got talking about it, because Jeremy came over to me and asked  me what the hell I was talking about, because you didn't know what you were talking about.  Oh, brother.  Oh, Jesus.  You actually tried speaking business with one of the bosses, drunk off your ass?  That is the Christmas party, never, ever, ever do thing.  Absolutely.  You don't.  I tried to get him to go over to Ken.  I'm like, why don't you go over to Ken and ask for a nice raise, John?  Oh, God.  And he was actually smart enough to not...  He didn't fall for that one.  Really?  He didn't fall for all the other tricks I set you up on.  Yeah, I should have known, because as I was doing the first four or five shots, I 
[00:42:30]  just see Ben coming up behind me going, yeah, John, yeah.  I'm like, uh-oh.  That's Ben.  Yeah, Ben was in, like, severe party mode.  Yeah, Ben had a job to do.  Yeah.  That was to get you really effed up.  And he did it quite well.  Hey, have we all forgotten that Steve pinched my ass 20 times?  No.  Thank you, John.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Later.  I got to tell you, a scene right out of Denny Terrio's Dance Fever.  Rachel and Stinky just tearing up the dance floor at one point.  Did you see that? 
[00:43:00]  There's no dancing at a Christmas party.  The music's playing.  Stinky, you were a dancing madman.  You got to dance.  You and Rachel just dancing like crazy.  I'm looking over going, what's Stinky doing?  He's dancing.  That's fun.  You know, you're all wasted.  You don't care.  You just dance.  Well, obviously.  At least you aren't pinching men's asses.  Exactly.  Or puking yourself deaf.  Was Rachel drunk?  I don't know.  Yeah, she was doing a lot of shows.  Yeah.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boy? 
[00:43:30]  Time to take advantage of it, Norton.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  You know, I knew there was a reason that I was getting all these damn gay pop-ups on foundrymusic.com,  man.  I knew he was a freaking flamer.  Bastard.  Are there gay pop-ups on foundry now?  No.  No.  Tons of them, dude.  No, there aren't.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, genius.  All right, bye.  Freaking rocket scientist.  Let's go to Will.  Someone's suggesting for Rick's deafness, it's Aaron, that he blows his nose really hard.  Tried it.  You did?  Really?  Rick, you really can't hear still out of the left ear. 
[00:44:00]  If I go like this, I can just hear, like, a low tone.  Oh, my God.  A low tone.  That's it.  That would freak me the F out.  Wow.  Hey, how was blowing your nose?  A nice change from the usual?  Oh, come on.  I'm sorry.  I'm kidding.  Will, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to tell Steve C. if Obie blinks twice, it's not rape.  Way to go, Will. 
[00:44:30]  That's right from the Jim Norton doll.  Thanks, guys.  Take it easy.  All right, well, that's fine.  Oh, that was great.  All right.  Well, well, well, well.  He drank Sandy's wine.  That's something.  He remembers that.  Hey, did we get a call from Mick Foley?  No.  Your train buddy?  My train buddy, Mick Foley?  Your train buddy.  Yeah, we'll talk about that, too.  Yeah, I was on the train with Mick Foley.  Yeah.  From Long Island to the city today.  Where'd you just get on the train and go, hey, Mick? 
[00:45:00]  And he looked up like, oh, and then he realized who I was.  Yeah.  And we sat and talked for, like, over an hour.  And then, Rick, someone died in Mineola.  Oh, yeah?  All right, cool.  Second time it's happened, the medical emergency.  Yeah.  Where they have to stop the train and wait for the ambulance to take the body off the train.  How hard is it to deposit the person off the train and get a roll in again?  Yeah, it's like hose it down and let's move it on.  Let's move it on.  They do it at Disney all the time. 
[00:45:30]  It's like the expressway.  I don't think somebody on that Matterhorn bobsled track gets hit or falls off the car.  That thing's right back on.  Barely notice a blip in the line.  We have a lot of friends that work for the Long Island Railroad.  I need to know if that person died today.  Medical emergency.  Second time in Mineola in the last year.  They better have, right?  I go to McFoley.  I'm like, dude.  How long have you got to wait?  I go, dude, this stop.  It's haunted.  I'm telling you.  Mineola.  Haunted.  Second time someone has dropped.  That's because there were that van load of kids that got creamed at that crossing many years ago. 
[00:46:00]  It is.  It's haunted.  Don't freak me out.  Stop.  Great idea.  You're drunk.  You're with your teenage buddies in a van.  I think there were eight or nine of them.  Is this a true story?  Yeah.  Swear to God.  I get it.  And they were in Mineola to go around one of the crossings.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Crash.  Totally just rolled the van over and over.  Kid parts flying out.  They all killed?  Yep.  I'm convinced.  I think one girl survived. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, one girl lived through it.  Wow.  And they said that that whole area is haunted by these kids.  They have said that?  Yeah.  That's why I was...  I was kidding about that.  Now I'm freaked.  No, true.  Because I was kidding about the stop being haunted.  No, very haunted.  But this is the second time someone has had a medical emergency in Mineola, second car,  both times.  Yeah.  That's it.  All right.  Great.  Stop. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, Vince Neal's coming in in about a half hour?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about the chicks?  They coming in?  We got some girls.  Yeah.  And girls?  Vince, there's got to be girls around.  Some of them.  Oh, my God.  I was going to break, but we got an ear doctor on the line.  Brian, what's up?  Hi.  I'm a doctor.  I hear a doctor out here in Jersey.  What happened?  He actually, like, refluxed vomit up to his eustachian tube into his ear, probably.  He's got puke in his ear?  Yeah, pretty much.  He's probably going to get a nasty ear infection.  You could get puke.  If he really can't hear out of his ear on that side. 
[00:47:30]  Rick's got puke in his...  Puke ear, puke ear.  Wow.  But, yeah.  You know what I'm a doctor, dude?  Who knew you could get puke in your ear?  Well, only if it starts hurting a lot, then, yeah.  If it doesn't hurt, just kind of bear with it.  It should get better.  Any kind of drops?  No, no drops.  No drops you can put out?  No, no magic drops.  A lot of scar leak.  So, Mr. Ear Doctor, you've heard of this before?  People puke so hard they mess up their hearing for a while?  Yeah, but not in medical school. 
[00:48:00]  In college.  I'll tell you, Rick.  I've been in that situation.  That must have been one of those where it feels like your yam bag is going to fly out your mouth.  One of those where you're going...  And it's just like every muscle...  You know what it is?  It's like a rope is attached to your stomach and someone is pulling up really hard.  Yeah.  And it all comes up.  And it's like...  And then there's that point where nothing's coming up, but your muscles won't untense.  You go...  And you're like, how long am I going to stay like that? 
[00:48:30]  How long can I live like this?  Not long, I think.  Well, the worst part about it...  I think something's got to seize up when I'm like this for this long.  The worst part about it, I was sitting on the bowl.  Yeah.  So, I had that going.  You had to do the reversal?  No, I couldn't even do that.  I just threw my head into the shower.  That's great.  So, it's right in the bathtub.  So, I learned how to clean that up.  You were doing that action and then you had to do...  Oh, yeah.  That's the worst.  The double-ended catastrophe.  Great, Rick. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Puked himself, Theft.  Wonderful.  All right.  We'll take a break.  And you know what?  We should talk about Christmas shopping next.  Yeah.  You aren't doing anything this weekend, Opie, because you said you were going Christmas shopping.  How'd you do?  You can hear from my voice.  I'm sick.  Oh.  Oh, so you didn't do anything.  Oh, we'll talk about it next.  I am so effed this year.  What's...  No.  So effed every year.  I got some theories on Christmas, though.  New York Shock Yacht's Opie and Anthony are now on the air. 
[00:49:30]  Welcome to the wonderful world of Balloon Not Pleasure.  Yeah.  If you need lube, you're a loser.  Take it like a champ, okay?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Threading like AIDS in Haiti.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots of good instant feedback coming in today, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Meet Curtain Lover from D.C. writes, hey, guys, what's up with the Sex for Sam 2?  Is that a near possibility in the future?  I heard about it from all my friends. 
[00:50:00]  I missed it.  Do you think you'll replay it over the holiday?  We will be replaying Sex for Sam 2.  What a great thing that was.  Just people running around Manhattan having all kinds of front and back door sex.  It really was an unbelievable show.  Second best show we did this past year.  Yeah.  Homeless Shopping Spree.  Homeless Shopping Spree 2 would be the best show we did this past year.  That was a great one.  And we're replaying that Christmas Eve, I believe.  What an appropriate time to replay that. 
[00:50:30]  So tell your friends about Homeless Shopping Spree.  Christmas Eve, we'll replay that.  And when we're away, definitely Sex for Sam 2 will be replayed as well.  Right.  And a lot of other stuff you've heard.  And some stuff for other cities that they've never heard.  Big Al from the city.  Rick Puking.  Are you sure Voss wasn't telling jokes?  Ah.  That didn't take long.  Voss.  Poor Voss.  And then Paul from New York writes,  Your Christmas party stories remind me of my very first office Christmas party.  Where I got so drunk I told one of the firm's senior partners to go F himself. 
[00:51:00]  Then when a friend tried to get me out of there and take me home,  I tried jumping into the driver's seat of a brand new Mercedes that the valet had just brought around.  It took three people to drag me out.  Needless to say, I started a new job shortly thereafter.  A lot of people get fired after the stupid things they do and say at Christmas parties.  Stupid people at Christmas parties, man.  They grab assing and stuff.  Oh, wait.  Steve did that.  Dean, what's going on?  Oh, and hey, what's up?  Hey. 
[00:51:30]  I remember, like, the first time I got drunk when I was, like, young teens.  Yeah.  I remember, like, I must have been throwing up so hard.  Like, it was dry heaving, the whole deal, right?  Oof.  So I woke up the next day.  I look in the mirror, and both my eyes are blood red.  I popped every blood vessel in my eye.  Whoa.  From puking too hard?  Yeah.  And I made my mommy go to the hospital, and there's nothing you can do about it, you know?  It was like that for two months.  All the white and my eyes were red.  You know what the sickest part is?  That's, like, just your blood pressure going through the roof in your head. 
[00:52:00]  You're lucky it didn't break in your brain.  I know.  It's like I was throwing up, and nothing was coming out, you know?  Well, there are times you're puking.  You just go, so much.  You're like, I know.  I'm just got, like, a huge pulsing artery in my skull is just going to pop.  How about when you start puking the lining of your stomach out?  Ah, that's good.  Little floating, tattered notes in the toilet or whatever the hell's coming out of there.  Apple skin. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you, Dean.  All right.  You guys roll.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  So, has everyone gotten their Christmas shopping done?  I am all done with, oh, I'm sorry.  I have nothing.  Nothing?  You haven't started?  I confused it.  I thought I was all done, but no, I haven't bought one person, one thing.  It sucks, man.  Christmas is a crock of ass, and someone needs to say it.  No one enjoys it anymore.  No one.  We're breaking tradition at the house, at Grandma's house next year. 
[00:53:00]  This is because everyone's disgusted.  This is huge.  Ever since I was a kid, as long as I can remember, we would go over to my grandmother's house on Christmas Eve, all the relatives pile in, presents all over the place, takes up the entire living room, because everybody gets presents for everybody.  So, you know, one aunt gets presents for everybody.  And then, you know, so you wind up going home with a lot of presents.  Next year, you know what's going to happen?  One person gets one person. 
[00:53:30]  That's it.  Secret Santa.  That's what they're doing.  We've been doing Secret Santa for years.  We were going to do it this year.  I stood up at Thanksgiving when this got brought up, and I'm like, no, this is against everything I am used to.  It didn't seem right.  You didn't want to go for the Secret Santa?  It didn't seem right.  You know how much easy that is?  I know.  And you make the most money.  They're all looking forward to getting what you buy.  Go for the Secret Santa.  Buy one sweater.  You know, I thought about it, and my mother got all mad at me on the phone last night and said that. 
[00:54:00]  Rick wants to know, did they park a truck outside and everyone just grabbed stuff from it?  Yeah, that was the old days.  Grabbing furs.  Yeah, oh, look who's here.  The second story man.  He's got to have some good stuff.  Yeah, so I think next year that's what we're doing.  You know, I think Christmas started off as a good thing.  I think it meant well.  I mean, let's not fool ourselves.  The Republicans invented Christmas to stimulate the economy. 
[00:54:30]  What?  I think it was the Whigs.  Whatever.  The Republicans invented Christmas.  Somebody did.  Were they Republicans a thousand years ago?  Well, to stimulate the economy, Anthony.  Oh, the Roman Republic.  Yeah, that's the only reason Christmas still exists, in my opinion.  All right.  To keep the economy going?  It's just awful.  I was shopping a little bit yesterday.  Is there any love and feeling when you're in the mall, trudging through crowds of people that you just want to blow snot rockets on? 
[00:55:00]  It's no fun.  You see the lines in the malls.  You don't even have to ask them how they feel.  You can see it in their expressions.  They're online.  They're like, I can't believe that with all the other crap I have to deal with in my life, I have to worry about this.  Are you really thinking about the person that it's going to?  This is really good.  I really thought this out.  This is what you think.  It's a grab fest. 
[00:55:30]  God damn it.  I know they bought me something, so I got to go buy them something now.  Yeah.  And I know what they bought me I'm going to hate.  I go through the mall like that old game show, Supermarket Sweep.  I just go running again.  Okay, this, good, good.  Time!  I got to get out of there as quickly as humanly possible.  But it's just a horrible, horrible, horrible thing, Christmas.  We tried to go Christmas shopping a couple of, a few weeks ago to get things early.  You know what would happen?  We walked out of there with stuff for ourselves.  I've bought a lot of stuff for myself. 
[00:56:00]  I walked into the goddamn, the software store that's in the mall, software, et cetera.  I come out with games and stuff and goodies and nothing for anybody.  Nothing.  This holiday season, I hooked myself up with brand new skis, three or four PlayStation 2 games,  the PlayStation game, two-game console, a really, really nice radio.  Right.  I'm buying for myself.  Yeah.  Well, it's all the stuff I'm not going to get.  I swear to God. 
[00:56:30]  You know what you should do in your family, Anthony?  Yeah.  Just tell everyone to go out shopping for themselves.  And then just have a nice little party or dinner, Christmas day.  And then you just stand up one by one and tell the rest of the family what you bought yourself.  You'd be so much happier.  You get too many people in the family that say, eh, you're not going to do that.  It's not right.  It's not the way.  It's not Christmas.  See, I got all caught up in it on Thanksgiving.  And I was like, no, that's not what Christmas is all about.  I know. 
[00:57:00]  What is wrong with you?  I was thinking, you know, I was getting very nostalgic about going over grandmas when I was a kid.  All the presents all in the tree.  It took the entire living room.  I feel bad for the parents out there.  Now there's going to be, what, a couple of little bags under the tree?  You know, I kind of was like, eh.  But how about this?  The parents out there, they buy for their kids and stuff, right?  Yeah.  They don't even get credit.  Well, for the young kids. 
[00:57:30]  Sure.  We're all human beings, though.  You want the credit.  They sit there and think, you know, some invisible man got them all these gifts.  Santa Claus.  While your hard-earned money, you know, went into getting their gifts.  Santa Claus.  The time, the effort.  Well, the fun is looking into their childlike eyes.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Tear-stained little faces.  Christmas music piping through the bathroom loudspeaker.  And then there's the best present of all, that don't-tell-our-little-secret present. 
[00:58:00]  That phone call to the parents.  That really bugs me that you made that speech.  Probably stood up a little drunk with some eggnog.  Yeah.  Pan-mary sauce on his chin.  Oh, Emily, damn it.  God damn it.  It's Christmas.  I know.  What a dick.  You know how many people hate you right now because you blew off, you know, they're not doing  secret Santa.  And Fran hates me.  Bobby.  My mother gave me crap last night.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  I'm talking to her on the phone and my mother's like, and you, it all would have been easy 
[00:58:30]  if it wasn't for you on Thanksgiving.  It's like, what?  I don't remember.  I was drunk on the eggnog and I had a cranberry I was wiping off in my mouth.  And, uh, yeah, she, she started bitching at me that I didn't, uh, that I didn't just  say, all right, we'll do it that way.  Cause then we would have done it that way.  But now I got to figure out what the, I don't know what to get grandma.  I never know.  I go to my mother.  It's my mother's mother.  You know, I say, what, what are you getting my grandma?  Cause I don't know.  She goes, I don't know.  She's got her TV.  She's got her chair.  It's all she needs.  That's all you needed. 
[00:59:00]  You pass a certain age.  If that's something, you pass a certain age, you need a TV and a chair.  That's it.  She goes, and then I got a gift certificate.  Cause I said, grandma, you want, uh, she goes to her mother.  Ma, you want a gift certificate to the mall?  She goes, ah, I got a drawer full of those.  I don't need it.  I got a drawer full.  Cause I don't go to the mall.  It's all the gift certificates from last year and the year before.  You know how much money is wasted on Christmas?  Chunk that is, uh, that is bought that people don't use.  Yep.  Throw out after a few years.  So she said, she's just getting her cash.  And that's what I'm doing.  All the kids. 
[00:59:30]  You're getting cash.  I know they listen.  You're getting cash from me.  That's good.  Because, uh, I was also, I'm like, what do you get this?  And my mother said the same thing.  She goes, what are you going to get kids that are like 14, 15, 16?  Cash.  Cash.  That's what they want.  And then they go and get their PlayStation 2 games or their Xbox games.  Yeah.  Cash.  Right.  But they think that's not personal enough.  I'm telling you, people love cash.  It's not like they're five and their eyes are going to open wide at a GoBot and a big mule.  Pretty up to cash with a little Christmas card thing. 
[01:00:00]  There you go.  You personalized it.  But people like cash.  And you don't need to spend money.  And then they can go and buy what they want.  What?  You don't need to spend money for it to be special.  Right.  Every girl I've banged in the last few years is getting a card with my test results.  And congratulations, you're getting weight loss for Christmas.  You know, I thought you were going somewhere else with that joke, bud.  Surprise, surprise.  Bobby, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Hey.  You going to break open your wallet this year or you going to go skiing, you cheap bastard? 
[01:00:30]  No, I get people's stuff.  That's not what it is.  Last year, Opie went skiing.  Last year, you went skiing.  You going to break open that wallet?  Look who's here.  Hey, he didn't make it.  Mick Foley.  Mick.  No, I'm going skiing and I'm leaving Friday.  You are what, cheap bastard?  I'm telling you.  No, it's not.  You know what, though?  What?  I'm effed because I really came down with something, I don't know, flu or something.  So I didn't get to do as much shopping as I wanted to this weekend.  And we have to work.  I'm shopping Thursday. 
[01:01:00]  That's it.  Thursday.  I'm on a plain Christmas day.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  So I think I'm going to do some of my shopping after Christmas.  Get all the sales.  That is the worst.  I'm not going to be around for Christmas.  All beds are off after Christmas.  No matter what you get, if you can get someone a goddamn brand new car, you missed Christmas.  But I'm not going to be around Christmas Day.  Ben, that's your brother.  You screwed up.  So they're not going to know that I got 50% off at Macy's.  $30 million and you're waiting for it.  Mick Foley.  Yes.  It is the thought that counts.  Is it the thought that counts? 
[01:01:30]  Let me tell you something, because I know a lot about this fine gentleman to my left here.  Mick Foley.  This guy loves Christmas so much, he celebrates it 365 days a year.  How about that?  That's true.  How about that?  And you know what?  Are you guys going to give me my chance to give the city of New York my special Christmas present here?  What is that?  I forgot to tell everyone.  I forgot to tell everyone.  All right.  We better go quick.  He can announce it.  Can I tell them about the train rendezvous?  We were on the train for...  No, we talked about that a little bit.  We were on the train.  Yeah, so I've got a dilemma going on.  Can I tell, Anthony, what you were reading on the train when I walked up to you? 
[01:02:00]  Uh-oh.  An article on Katie Couric in Star Magazine.  Oh, really?  He says he's very close to being a stalker of Katie Couric.  Are you?  Yeah, it's a comfortable distance away, but I realized that part of me wanted to go, you  know, behind the fence there.  Right, right.  To say hello.  Behind her when they're alive.  And then I realized that if I did that, I would indeed be a stalker.  Yeah, yeah.  So really the only time...  You like her perkiness, is it?  You know, I think she's wonderful.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I've been on the show a couple times, and it's really nice to know, and I know this 
[01:02:30]  is not what your audience wants to hear, but she's even nicer in person, even more  beautiful.  You must have loved that episode where they gave her the colonoscopy, huh?  Yeah.  Let me talk about the damn tickets.  If I could only be a camera.  Can I talk about the tickets?  Hell yeah.  He's going to be giving away some tickets.  Yeah, I'm sitting here.  I'm agonizing.  What?  Sorry.  My big family get-together has fallen apart, because it was supposed to be a Radio City  Music Hall in half an hour.  I've seen the Christmas Spectacular. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, I love when the girls all dress like the big, they have the big costumes on like  the wooden soldiers, and they fall backwards.  Wait till that part, Mick, before you shoot yourself in the head.  Read this and tell them the price on these tickets, okay?  They're really expensive.  These are not the wimpy tickets.  Tell me about it.  I bought some for my god-effing in-laws once, Mick.  I spent the whole day at Radio City with that damn Christmas show.  Yeah, but did you get a call two days before the show saying, you know, I've got a, I'm 
[01:03:30]  doing something with the Marty Lyons Foundation, and my conscience will not let me go to Radio  City if I've told a bunch of kids I'm going to be at a foundation, so essentially what  I'm here for is I've got, I've got, I had nine tickets, but I've been walking down the  streets like Santa Claus, handing them away, and so I've got six left, so my thing is,  I'm going to go down, this is what I'm going to, I'm improvising here, I'm going to go  down to the lobby, and I'm just, your lobby, I'm just going to stand outside there where  the guys catch smokes.  How about outside the Brooklyn Diner?  Outside the Brooklyn Diner, and I'm going to be standing there for the next five minutes, 
[01:04:00]  and whoever wants, whoever wants, whoever wants to go,  wants these tickets, they're $85 tickets, and so if you want two, I've got two, if you  want four, I've got four, if you want six, I've got six.  Just make sure you're going to go.  Yeah, make sure you're going to go.  Don't just take them, because dude, look what Mick gave me, you know?  So it's a great show, I don't know if it's great for the Whip Them Out Wednesdays crowd  or not, but.  Well, we got some normal.  We do, right?  We got a lot of normal.  A lot of ONA listeners bought the Halloween book.  It's very family oriented, people like it if they go with the family and stuff, but I went with 
[01:04:30]  my in-laws to that goddamn thing.  It was time I will never, ever get back, and it was going backwards every time I looked  at my wife.  Are you going to kiss my ass or not?  We were talking about the Vince kissing my ass story along the train.  It went a little too far.  You know what?  Maybe it's a good thing I'm not going to this stupid show.  You know why?  I went in 96.  This is back when I was living in Atlanta, so my wife came up.  No change.  The same goat on stage. 
[01:05:00]  And this is the day before Survivor Series, I'm going to wrestle The Undertaker.  Big grudge match.  Madison Square Garden.  My first pay-per-view of Madison Square Garden.  Yeah.  We go to the thing, and first off, if you go to the Christmas spectacular before Thanksgiving,  it kind of sucks anyway.  Yeah.  But it didn't suck as bad as my match that next day did.  And so I went in there, I stunk up the garden, and I usually did pretty well on these pay-per-views,  so I've got a bad vibe about going to Radio City for this spectacular.  But I'm going to head downstairs now.  All right.  With your tickets in my hand. 
[01:05:30]  $85 tickets.  Hey, Mick, I just got to tell you one thing.  What?  Rumor has it, you know that delay in Mineola today?  Yeah.  Dead.  Dead?  Really?  Dead.  Dead guy?  He's dead.  Heart attack?  Someone was saying something about being a junkie.  Oh, really?  It's a rumor right now, but we're trying to get to the bottom of it.  But supposedly dead.  Junkie's taking the train now?  Three seats behind where Mick and I were sitting.  We were having a real enjoyable chat, but after about 20 minutes at Mineola, it's like,  come on.  Yeah, enough.  All right.  Did you have any uncomfortable silence between you two? 
[01:06:00]  Actually.  No, we were okay looking out the window.  We have similar backgrounds, I'm thinking.  That's right, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Tell us Stan Kellner.  I brought up a guy named Stan Kellner.  He knows who he is.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I was talking about visualizing.  A basketball coach on Long Island.  Right.  I wasn't a very good athlete in the ring, but I was a good visualizer.  And he says, you know, you remind me of this coach I used to say, Stan Kellner.  He said, oh, my God, how do you know that?  He was a basketball cybernetics guy.  See the picture.  Think the picture.  Do the picture.  Don't be afraid to make mistakes. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, there you go.  Now, here's our first uncomfortable silence of the day.  No, no.  That's a nice philosophy.  Listen, I'm going to head down.  All right, Nick.  Just like you said, if you're going to take the tickets, at least go to the show.  Yeah, go to it.  And not only that, you get to see me in a suit.  And how many times do you get to see that?  Yeah, that kind of surprised me.  You came in.  I thought he was a conductor.  You were?  I swear to God.  I swear.  I swear.  Because he's got the American flag pin on the side.  What about the woman who sat down next to me?  Did you tell him about that?  I didn't know if your wife was listening. 
[01:07:00]  No, you know what?  I didn't know if you were being nice.  What did he do to her?  We're in an empty car.  You've got to worry if the wife is listening.  We're in an empty car.  This lady was creepy.  She sits right next to McFoley.  I'm in the middle of a three-seat, you know.  Right.  And she goes, I'm really cold.  Can you keep me warm?  Or something like that.  And it wasn't like a sexual overtone.  I was like, what do you want me to do?  What the hell does that mean?  Just sit there.  I'll just feed off your warmth.  Swear to God.  She was good off of this.  She was kooky.  Wow, that's weird.  Yeah, is she good looking or was she a fatty?  She had crazy eyes.  Yeah.  Oh, crazy eyes?  Crazy eyes. 
[01:07:30]  Maybe she was a fan there.  She was no Patty the Stalker.  Yeah, thank God for that.  She was no Mick Foley reading the star to catch up on Katie Couric.  That is kind of sad.  Listen, guys, I've got to go, okay?  Always great to see you.  There you go.  Stop by when you've got more time.  I will, definitely.  When I have something to plug that will benefit me financially, I'll be here.  Very good.  At least he's honest, god damn it.  He told me about his latest project.  Yeah.  Pretty good, right, O?  Interesting.  You've got some thoughts in your mind.  He's going to write another book, Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, the Mick Foley novel.  A novel?  You're talking fiction?  Yeah.  All I do is, you know, I wrote about all the nice people I met in the autobiography,  so now I saved up all the horrible stories, and I just add a little twist to make them fiction.  Change a couple of names around.  Let's just put it this way.  Jim Norton would really enjoy this book.  Who else did you write?  Right there.  Oh, sorry.  That's who I thought it was.  I hear them on the show occasionally, right?  Yes, you do.  Okay.  All right, Mick.  All right, thanks, guys.  You'll be outside of Brooklyn Diner with your Christmas tickets.  Waving them around. 
[01:08:30]  I'm the guy with the missing teeth in the suit.  Is there a Vance McLan in your book?  No.  I'm just wondering if maybe you've changed the name around.  There's a Moongoose McQueen.  Moongoose.  Oh, I get you.  Vance.  Vance McLan.  I do have to say one thing before Mick leaves.  Yeah.  This guy is the nicest person in the world, man.  He couldn't walk 10 feet without someone stopping him, and he was cordial to every single person.  What's he going to do?  Grab him by the throat and slam him down?  Well, he stopped and gave every...  That would be nice to see, though, wouldn't it?  He stopped and gave every person a little of his time. 
[01:09:00]  But I'll tell you a little something later on.  Did he get ripped off on that fake cabbie, though?  No, he charged me an eight.  I gave him a $2 tip.  He got in the fake cab, man.  The fake cab?  The guys that just go around trying to find people.  The guy was leaning on the horn heavy, too, using bed.  He had language, also.  Nick, you might get kidnapped like that.  I know.  It could just be some guy.  Hey, dude, I've got Mick Foley.  He's coming to my house for dinner.  I'm coming over to your house.  I got him in the trunk.  Get the sledgehammer and big block of wood.  We're going to hobble him.  He's going to show us how he jumped off the top of that cage. 
[01:09:30]  It's in his basement.  He's got a ring set up, and you just have to wrestle with him 24 hours a day.  With the fake crowd noise.  How long?  King of comedy.  King of comedy.  Rupert Pumpkin, man.  Rupert Pumpkin.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Okay.  Thanks, guys.  He's going to be down in front of the Brooklyn Dive.  Wait, wait.  Let me tell you about me being the nicest guy in the world.  Oh, wait.  The truth is, I'm usually pretty nice, but I've found that, you know, human nature being  what it is, I'm even nicer to really good-looking women.  Wow. 
[01:10:00]  That's odd.  You know, handicapped children and really good-looking women get a little extra attention.  They're handicapped, good-looking women.  They can't run.  Unlike them.  All right.  I'll see you later, guys.  All right.  Mick, take it easy, Mick.  You know, I was going to take that, but just go the opposite way.  I'll be waving the tickets.  All right.  He's going to be waving the tickets.  Like it's going to take them any time at all.  There's probably already a crowd down there.  Go down there with the phone.  Go down there with the phone and see what happens.  Ah, damn it.  The tickets will be good.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see.  We'll be back.  It's the OP and Anthony show.  Vince, is he here?  Yeah.  He's on his way up. 
[01:10:30]  Vince Neil is on his way upstairs and some broads and stuff.  Some broads.  The OP and Anthony show.  1027 WNEW.  What up?  This is the OP and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Buffalo, New York.  Hello, Buffalo.  If you weren't listening earlier, Buffalo gave us incredible, incredible ratings.  A little ratings trend came out, and we're just flying. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  We're in really good shape in Buffalo.  We're in good shape in three of the cities we broadcast to.  Of course, New York.  We're in very, very good shape.  But besides that, Philly, Cleveland, and Buffalo all coming to the table big time.  Big time.  Yes.  Dallas.  Eh, we're on the middle of the night.  Yeah, it's kind of a weird time.  We're not expecting much from Dallas.  We're expecting a lot from Boston.  We're still waiting.  We're expecting something from Washington one of these days. 
[01:11:30]  And we've gone up to Boston quite a few times.  It'll happen.  Other cities have given us great results supporting this program, and we haven't been there.  Yet they still continue to come on board in great numbers.  Boston?  Oh, we go up there.  It don't matter.  Anywhere else, including Buffalo, give us a call.  866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  Anthony, there's a picture up of Lady Di fellating a dog, it looks like. 
[01:12:00]  You were telling the story earlier.  You went to the OpieAnthony.com message board Christmas party.  Yeah, and there was a bar nine here in Manhattan, and she was there, drunk off her ass with the  other retarded Laverne and Shirley member, Marion.  And Lady Di was so drunk, disgusting drunk, that at one point a snowman, a guy in a big fuzzy 
[01:12:30]  snowman suit.  Ken Norton.  Big fuzzy snowman suit.  Oh, this was a real guy.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was just a snowman, like on display.  No, no, no, it was like a guy wearing a suit, you know, and he walks around waving.  Oh, my God, it makes it even more disgusting.  I know.  And there was another guy dressed like a reindeer or something.  All right.  And she went up to the carrot-like nose on this snowman, Lady Di, all drunk and disgusting,  and starts sucking on the nose.  She's giving a hummer to the nose of the snowman. 
[01:13:00]  And there's a close-up picture here where all you see is a reddish-orange thing in her  hand and her big, fat face wrapping her lips around it with fur on the other end.  It looks like bestiality pictures that I have seen on the Internet.  But before they've done bad, it's just a carrot.  Right, it's a carrot.  On the nose or whatever.  Just her fat-  The nose of the-  But the angle of the picture, and you don't really see much of the snowman, you just kind  of see what looks like fur, yeah, like- 
[01:13:30]  Her drunk, fat, lipless mouth.  Look at it.  Just look at that awful-  Look at it.  She should be pushing her kids into a lake.  That's what she looks like with those glasses.  How many pictures of a woman's mouth do you look at and go,  I wouldn't even put it in there?  One.  Wouldn't even put it in there.  There it is, right in front of me.  The carrot's wilting.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Chris.  Yes.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing tonight, sir?  All right.  I must generally confess, because I thought the way you were coming over, you were getting 
[01:14:00]  down on Christmas and saying, I thought you were saying some bad things about the Lord.  Never said anything about the Lord.  No.  I'm just so glad.  I was talking about Santa.  Is Santa the Lord?  What's your view on the Lord, sir?  You're one of those religious guys?  And so what if I was there, sir?  I'm just asking.  I don't think that would be too funny to talk about.  Why not?  You don't think God has a sense of humor?  I'm going to step in right now, Opie, and say this guy's full of crap. 
[01:14:30]  Well, because you're incredibly unfunny, and I'm giving you great ratings of Buffalo,  because this is the unfunny guy.  There it is.  See?  He was trying to get in as a...  Mary is really good.  You've got to give her a squeeze and a hug, because she sounds like a really sweet intern.  Chris, let me ask you something, okay?  Because you call a lot, and you don't like the show, right?  Actually, I like the show.  Oh, then you're not the guy that doesn't like the show.  I'm Jeremy.  I'm Chad.  I'm all those guys.  But you know what?  What?  You guys got to spice up your repertoire. 
[01:15:00]  You know, for sometimes you get really stuck on a subject, and you burn it out.  Burn it out.  Yeah.  But, you know...  Wait, like what?  Like this call?  No, like...  I understand that.  I don't know.  You guys are, you know, you're a breath of fresh air here in Buffalo, but...  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Because I'm from Buffalo.  Oh, whatever.  There's a lot...  Shut up.  God, I don't even care.  You know, sometimes when people call up and they bash us, I don't care.  And as long as it sounds great, like some guys that yell, and they're, you suck. 
[01:15:30]  Shut up.  You suck.  And it's fun to argue with.  That guy is just like some guy I don't even want to be in the same room with ever.  And, you know, I call up sometimes.  I'm Jeremy, and I'm this guy.  Chad.  Shut up.  Shut up and die.  The charisma of testicular polyps.  Maybe that's what he's talking about.  We're, you know, too many of those type of...  Jeez, man.  Of one-liners.  Not enough.  Alan B. checking in from Philly, saying, you lost me at Lady Di fellating. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Right after that, you don't want to hear anything else.  It's just a low droning noise.  Check out the picture for yourself.  OpieAnthony.com.  Is there another one, Ben, that's coming through?  It's disgusting.  Oh, I thought you were checking for more pictures.  Yeah, anybody.  I know there were a lot of people at the OpieAnthony.com message to our party last night that were taking pictures.  Hey.  I want to see pictures.  Do we know anyone at the Don Ima show?  Uh, no.  He was on MSNBC.  Yeah.  Tim Russ had interviewed him.  Was, uh, I wearing a, um... 
[01:16:30]  A, um, big, fag cowboy hat.  Well, that's what I'm getting at, yes.  And, uh, bandana.  Someone that, uh...  Oh, destiny.  Someone that works close to Don Ima has got to be brave enough to tell him he looks completely stupid with that big, huge cowboy hat.  Well, um, I'm a, uh, cowboy.  First of all, cowboy hats look stupid on anyone, I think.  On a steel, uh...  Of course I ride, I'm wanted, uh, dead or alive.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, Bernard, you jerk.  But the cowboy hat is too big for his head.  He looks ridiculous. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, it's a big...  He looks ridiculous.  And no one is brave enough to tell him that we're close to him.  You know what it looks like?  Dude, the cowboy hat's not happening, especially in the middle of Manhattan.  It looks like, uh, it looks like when they take, uh, retarded children on a ride and give them the...  And give them the big cowboy hat.  You know the hat that's too big?  You got me, because that's exactly what I was thinking, dude.  And they just rock back and forth in the saddle.  The horse is just taking them somewhere.  It's like, look, I'm riding.  No, you're not riding.  You are definitely just a passenger on this thing. 
[01:17:30]  What looks...  Doing whatever it was.  Big head flopping around with the cowboy hat.  What looks sillier?  Dukakis with the big army helmet in the tank?  The big tank helmet.  Or Todd Imus with the big cowboy hat.  Michael Dukakis, during those ads, it wasn't even for Dukakis.  It was the Bush ads.  But it was, uh, it was Michael Dukakis in a tank with this big, goofy helmet on and a big, dopey smile on his face with his head bobbing around in a tank.  And, uh...  Someone had to think that that ad looked ridiculous. 
[01:18:00]  George Bush used it in an ad.  George Bush used it in his ad.  And just said...  To show how silly he was.  And said, is this the man you want in charge of our military?  That was the slogan.  And everyone said it.  It was like, ah, pull the lever for George.  Right.  But, yeah, the Imus big, giant cowboy hat.  I don't even know what he was saying.  Bigger than Haas' 10-gallon hat on the bonanza.  The hat is...  It looks like a sombrero hat.  I, uh, keep my, um, uh, oxygen, uh, tank under, under my hat. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  4.55.  Wah, wah.  Imus on the morning show.  You know what I, um, I use, uh, my hat for?  Uh.  Back at the ranch, we, um, take it off.  I, uh, I turn it upside down and fill it with my brother's sauce.  And we dip out of my hat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whoa, Destiny, don't throw me again.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, jerk.  You don't like Imus?  No, Imus doesn't like everybody. 
[01:19:00]  I enjoy Imus.  Do you?  I really do.  Do you like a little Imus in the morning?  I really do.  All right.  Jay, what's going on?  Here you go, Norton.  There's a plug for Imus, guys.  That's all right.  I don't care.  It's okay.  You can like somebody.  That's all right.  Jay, what's up?  Oh, hey.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Uh, carf day in Washington, D.C.  Just, uh, you guys heard you guys talking a little while ago about, uh, you know, you're  not getting a whole lot of support from Washington, D.C.  Uh, I'm an officer in the Marine Corps down here.  And, uh, you guys, uh, you guys on this whole Afghanistan thing, but tell it like it is.  And, uh, we like what you guys are saying. 
[01:19:30]  You got, uh, you got all the Marines down here at Quantico, Virginia listening to you.  Oh, cool.  Kick ass.  Kick ass.  We don't really know what we're talking about.  We're just kind of, you know, speaking our mind, I guess.  I get all my info from, uh, the news.  You guys, uh, you guys tell it like it is, though, you know?  You guys don't pull any punches and, uh, and you guys, uh, you guys sound off some good  things, uh, every now and then.  All right.  You know something?  You bring up something that I can talk about.  Uh, uh, this whole, uh, Osama bin Laden.  Uh, surrounded thing that was going on over the weekend. 
[01:20:00]  I said this last weekend.  Now, I, I got, I got to tell you something.  The press was convinced we would have had him by now.  Look, the press are a bunch of douchebags.  Douchebags.  Here they are, uh, uh, broadcasting that, oh, they got him surrounded.  Here's where our troops are.  Here's where Osama is.  I think they're surrounded and they're going to get him.  Do you think if he hears this, he's going to just stay where he is and be taken by surprise?  We should have seen anything at work.  We were talking about anything at work.  We're thinking, you know, if you, if you sit there and keep saying, hey, uh, we know 
[01:20:30]  where he's at.  We know where he's at.  We know where he's at.  And here's where we're bombing and here's what we're doing.  I want you to sit there and wait for us to come get him.  Yeah, like he's just going to be sitting there going, oh, did you see the videotape  when he's describing the towers, uh, coming down?  I was talking about how he was listening to the news.  A Washington news station.  A Washington news station.  A Washington, these jerk offs trying to get the jump on the other news network are giving  out locations and, uh, uh, officials are giving out, uh, locations to the press.  Worse than the press are the people that know this info in the government that are talking 
[01:21:00]  to the press because they want to be the big guy.  You know what I mean?  Keep your friggin' yaps shut.  And maybe we might get the guy.  As long as the press keeps saying, he's in these tunnels, we're bombing them, the tunnels  are surrounded, he's going to make a real hardcore effort to get the F out of those tunnels,  isn't he?  Yep.  There might be a situation where he is somewhere, we know, but he doesn't know we know, then  you can go in and get him without him running away.  But no, it's never going to happen because the press are a bunch of douchebags. 
[01:21:30]  But where is the press getting all this info?  Someone in the military.  Yeah, those guys who should be shot for treason.  Bunch of asses.  Hey, uh, Jay, Jay, do we execute, uh, John Walker?  Uh, yeah.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Why am I asking a Marine?  Of course.  George W. today said he, uh, George W. today said he will not stand a military tribunal because  that's just for, uh, for, uh, uh, people that aren't American citizens.  This guy, for some reason, they're still going to be considered an American citizen.  And, um, you know what that involves? 
[01:22:00]  Since it's not a military tribunal.  Well, he'll get a lawyer, they'll go to court, and those scum-sucking leech F-bag lawyers  will twist something around, play him off as a poor, confused lad who didn't do anything  wrong.  He was misguided by this powerful, uh, Taliban.  And, you know what he's going to get?  Nothing.  They'll let him off the hook or give him some, a slap on the wrist.  Because, uh, uh, in actuality, a lawyer can twist this around like he didn't do a goddamn  thing.  He was brainwashed and taken over there as innocent as any one of those morons that killed themselves 
[01:22:30]  thinking they were going to go on a spaceship behind a town comet or drank the, uh, the,  uh, uh, Kool-Aid with Jim Jones.  It's the same thing.  He was sucked in by a cult, and thank God we've got him back, and he's normal.  He does the talk show circuits, he makes lots of money, and, uh, lives happily ever after.  And you know who's been defending him and calling him misguided?  The stupid liberals in this country.  Because whenever it's a white kid that does something, they're like, oh my God, he was 
[01:23:00]  just misguided.  No.  He wasn't misguided.  When you receive treats from a hooker, and when you're done, you go, wow, I thought you  were a girl.  That's misguided.  That's misguided.  When you put on sandals and stop showering, you're a traitor, and you should be shot.  Absolutely.  We did ourselves a disservice by not taking him out of Mazar-e-Sharif.  Yeah, I don't understand, uh.  He should have put a bullet in his head.  Especially considering, uh, one of our guys bought it over there. 
[01:23:30]  I mean, you know what, the guys go in and capture him.  Let's just pop these people in the head.  Using, uh, Jim Norton's philosophy, we just lost two boroughs of New York.  With the showering and the sandals.  Dirty, unwashed, filthy feet.  The Bronx and what?  I'm kidding, Bronx.  Shut up.  See, I'm very safe with my jokes.  Now they're trying to figure out which boroughs did he mean?  Of course they are.  Whoever approaches you, you can just go, no, not that one.  Of course. 
[01:24:00]  That's what I'm thinking.  Which two boroughs are you talking about?  All right, Jay, thank you.  Hey, take care, fellas.  Hoorah.  See you, man.  We should take a break because we have Vince Neal outside the studio.  Uh, breaking news, there's not much, uh, uh, uh, not, uh, not many details coming yet,  but, uh, Tom Green files for divorce from Drew Barrymore.  Tom Green filed.  Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Hate him.  Tom Green files for divorce from Drew Barrymore.  You know what, uh, that leads me to believe?  Uh-uh.  That she was, uh... 
[01:24:30]  She was like, oh, my God, I married the stupidest man in Hollywood who made the worst movie of  all time.  Like, she was moving around doing something.  And to the people in, uh, Blackbusters this weekend that were trying to figure out if they  should rent, uh, Freddy Got Fingered or not, you guys are losers.  Worst movie ever made.  Ever.  Poor guy.  I bet there was no copies of it left, though, because every fatso runs in and grabs the  new film to shove food in their dumb mouths and watch.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  There was, like, one copy left.  You're so right. 
[01:25:00]  It's a Saturday.  Let's sit on the couch.  You're right.  A new release.  And there were no Joe Dirt's?  Of course not.  Oh, Christ.  I, I can go past, I don't, I, I can go past the new releases record speed.  I, I, you see the people sitting there pondering a movie like Joe Dirt, looking at it,  reading the box, reading the box.  Don't you love the people in the freaking thing, I want to punch them in the face, that  read the box aloud to their significant other?  Of course they're going to make the movie look good on the box. 
[01:25:30]  How about you take this box and just shove it down your throat until you can't get any  air and die on the floor of Blockbuster.  The ones that read it aloud to their mate.  And they don't even rent pornos, that stupid family-oriented dumb store.  Or get some popcorn, guys, and watch with your fat, stupid family.  And it's worse than that.  They edit the movies now.  Yes, some of the movies they get.  Or they all read the NC-17, of course.  They get different versions.  Blockbuster has their own rules and they, they edit films accordingly.  Oh, yeah.  I, I wouldn't know because I haven't been in that dump in three years. 
[01:26:00]  I would never rent there.  I'll buy a DVD from the DVD Palace on 8th Avenue.  They, they take scenes out of some of the movies, bro.  Of course they do.  Not family-oriented.  You know, I, I could see that if that's what you want to do with your company.  But, I mean, we, we really don't have a choice.  That, this is only Blockbuster.  Doesn't Huizinga own that?  Isn't he this, Wayne Huizinga?  Viacom owns that.  Viacom.  Our fine, fine company that owns this very station and a billion other entities around this globe.  But Blockbuster does have a lot of choices, so. 
[01:26:30]  No, they don't.  They still haven't turned their movies over to DVD.  Oh, really?  This is like a half a wall of DVD in my, uh, Blockbuster.  Why am I still, uh...  That DVD thing is taking off.  Let's wake up.  I realize that, but if Mr. Karmeson...  It's not beta.  Hello, it's not beta.  It's going to be around for a while.  Mr. Karmeson thinks this is the way to go.  I'm not one to disagree.  You're going to go.  That's right.  Go for it.  And Ben and Rick can disagree with them all they want.  I choose not to.  Real fast, uh, did anyone see the score?  Yes. 
[01:27:00]  I rented that.  Yes.  What did you think?  Uh, I love anything Brando does, I love it.  Brando is, Brando is such an amazing actor.  He's just amazing.  He was barely in it, but he's just so smooth and so good.  You can go, well, he's not there.  Shut up, stupid.  He is that good.  I, uh, saw it when it came out.  It wasn't that good, right?  What the hell?  What's her face in there?  Uh, uh, Bassett.  Oh, Angela Bassett.  Worthless in that movie.  There was no reason for her to be in that goddamn movie.  They tried to make some kind of a love angle between her and De Niro. 
[01:27:30]  Obviously, we know what happened.  De Niro's banging her, so he put her in the movie.  Yep.  That seems to me he likes to get dark meat there, Earl.  Yeah.  You know that?  No, he does.  He does.  And I don't like Angela Bassett unless she's being raped on a console by Larry Fishburne.  That's when I like Angela Bassett.  Good scene.  Yes, it was a fine scene.  I didn't hear that.  That was Tina Turner, I thought.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  That's great.  That was a good song.  She didn't have to be in there.  And Edward Norton.  Edward Norton looking retarded.  Really good.  What a great tard he plays.  But he gives Giovanni Ribisi a run for his tarred money. 
[01:28:00]  But it looks like they ran out of money because they had to pay Brando and De Niro and Norton  that there was no one else in the movie.  Yeah.  A couple people just throwing around for filler for the, you know.  Good nice ending.  Had a great ending, I thought.  That was all right.  I thought it was good.  It kind of turned around.  It was slow, man.  It was slow.  But what are you going to do?  They take out the parts with Angela Bassett.  I should have known because when I read the back of the box, not Rupert. 
[01:28:30]  Did you read it aloud to Sandy?  Who's the dead one?  Dead one, what?  Siskel?  Wait, wait.  Siskel.  All right.  Ebert's alive.  Old Puddin' head.  This is what I do.  I turn the box over and if it...  One thumb in the hole in my skull.  That was my line.  Was it?  Yes.  Yes.  Three years ago.  How am I supposed to remember a line from three years ago?  I don't have many.  Look, it's on my sheet of lines.  Look.  Now it's mine.  1998, I said that.  Look.  Let me see.  I don't have many. 
[01:29:00]  Hold on.  I got my lines...  95, 96, hold it.  My lines are in a pamphlet.  You've got volumes of lines.  One thumb in the hole in my skull.  All right.  I'll give it to you.  That was Old P's.  Attention, ladies and gentlemen.  Attention.  There has been an error.  Anthony received credit for a line that was Old P's.  Please rewrite your scorecard.  But you don't have many lines on the radio show.  You've got to keep track.  Look.  Here they are.  Three sheets.  Opie's line.  Here's my seven years of material on three sheets. 
[01:29:30]  In big font.  In big font.  Double space.  Look.  Bitcourt.  Bitcourt alert.  It's got volumes.  The whole freaking back wall is filled with volumes.  The litigants are now entering the courtroom.  But anyway, when I read the back of the box, if there's not...  I knew I'd hear Opie going hoo, hoo, hoo.  I was kidding.  I've got to defend myself.  You know I'm joking.  The Rupert and...  Brett Berger Opie.  The Rupert and Ebert.  If they don't have a line...  Oh yeah, now it's Rupert. 
[01:30:00]  If they don't have a line about the movie on the back of the box that comes from one  of their reviews, then I don't read the movie.  Really?  For the movies I don't know about.  Interesting.  Because I don't want to be tricked by what the box has to say.  Well, you never believe what's written on the box.  And do you know how many of us have fallen into those traps in life?  I was tricked by what the box said.  And I'll tell you.  Sure, I'll visit your parents.  And I'll tell you, the box is expecting a lot this Christmas, and I'm panicking.  Oh my God, you just said the box. 
[01:30:30]  Good boy, Opie.  Horrid.  Good boy.  Oh, she knows it's my on-air character.  Yeah.  That's my new thing.  It's a cacta.  It's my on-air persona.  You've got to use my cacta.  All right, Vince Neal, on the way in the studio, Anthony.  We'll talk to him next.  Are the girls here?  Because that's what we're doing.  We're doing a little stall tactics here.  Not yet, but I might have to punch you again.  Oh, shut up.  Call his sister the box.  And how did you hear that? 
[01:31:00]  You only got one ear working today.  It's almost closer to you.  Pukier.  Pukier.  All right, Vince Neal, up next.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to the show?  L.B. and Anthony.  Pukier's drunk and white trash.  Hi, Dutch rules.  This is the L.B. and Anthony show.  Vince Neal making his way into the studio.  Really fast day from New York City, right?  Hey, Norton, go F yourself.  Saying that liberals are saying this Walker a-hole is misunderstood and should be let off. 
[01:31:30]  F you.  I'm a goddamn liberal.  I haven't heard one effing person, aside from his stupid-ass parents,  claim that he is anything but a traitor who should be shot on sight.  F you for trying to blame liberals for something that just ain't true.  And spoken like a true liberal.  I'm not blaming all liberals.  I'm talking about people I've spoken to that are liberals.  I'm not saying all liberals.  I've heard plenty of liberals say they wanted him tried for treason and executed.  I'm talking about the guys I've spoken to.  The liberals are the first one that'll get tired of this whole thing and just want it to go away. 
[01:32:00]  No, but he's right.  There's plenty of real liberal people that want this guy shot for treason.  I think we talked to a couple last week about that.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Anthony.  We always debate.  I'm looking at the cover of Blender.  Blender magazine.  Oh, yeah.  Vince Neal.  How you doing, man?  What's up, guys?  You see Alicia Keys on the cover?  Yes.  What do you think of this girl, Alicia?  Alicia Keys?  I don't know who that is.  You don't know who Alicia Keys is?  No.  She's like the hottest artist this year. 
[01:32:30]  She's pretty hot.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Does that blues thing.  You know what, though?  I see inside they got some pictures of her, high school pictures and college.  How come these girls that have an African background, and I've noticed this before with other ones,  like the lead singer of Destiny's Child and stuff, they look like Nordic girls with a tan,  a little bit of a tan, on these things like this.  Nice.  You go back, it's Farina. 
[01:33:00]  She's black as goddamn, I don't know what happens over time.  She's a, look, beautiful girl, right?  Yeah, she's very light-skinned black.  Great natural tan, it looks like, pretty much.  That's it.  Look at her.  Take a look.  Am I wrong?  I want to see the picture of her from high school.  She's young, though, Anthony.  That was only a couple years ago.  I mean, dark.  Where's the high school picture?  The high school picture, she's much darker than the cover.  No, that's the picture of Vince going to town with two girls and then falling asleep. 
[01:33:30]  Vince, you're in Blender, by the way.  Did you know you were in the latest issue of Blender?  No, I had no idea.  Show Vince the picture.  Wait, wait, where was I?  I don't know.  Maybe you can tell us where this is.  Hold on.  I've got to ask you, is this a setup?  No.  Oh, okay.  In the top picture, he's making out with the chick to his left.  In the picture below it, he starts making out with the chick to his right.  Then he puts his face in the chick on the right's chest.  And then the last picture is him asleep in that chair. 
[01:34:00]  I know.  I remember this.  You do?  I remember this.  What are these girls' names?  I can't remember that.  It's always good when you remember.  Yeah.  Did C.C. pinch his ass any time during this?  This is at a restaurant in Beverly Hills called Crustacean.  Yeah.  And it's like, it's right out, you know, everybody drives by.  It's right on the sidewalk, kind of.  It's right on the sidewalk.  That's, uh...  So is this, uh...  The Troubled Singer.  I was, I was, Troubled, I guess I just fell asleep.  It didn't look like Troubled Renee. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, you know who that is?  That's Lene Hefner, the porno star.  Oh, right.  Oh, yeah.  That's how you know you get a lot of box when you forget a porno star.  And then you gotta look at a picture in a magazine to remember.  That's Lene.  What happened there with that story?  Did anything else happen?  With those pictures?  We were, uh...  We were there for a long time.  Yeah.  Okay, and, uh...  You know, I just dozed off for a second.  Yeah, that's all it takes.  Yeah.  Goddamn paparazzi with their cameras.  What was that?  You got two girls on the line right there, huh? 
[01:35:00]  That's great.  Yeah, it was...  Goddamn.  It all worked out in the end.  I guess so.  No one in this room will ever doubt you.  Oh, you bet.  We all read the book.  What the hell magazine is this?  Johnny Ray's.  Rock and roll, Johnny.  Why is he all alone having a beer?  That's pretty funny.  What do you mean?  I hate seeing somebody without a drinking partner or something.  Oh, God.  Sure.  Grab me a beer.  Yeah.  Vince, I have a feeling...  Oh, there you go. 
[01:35:30]  Thank you.  Johnny Ray's rock and roll.  I have a feeling something has changed since the last time you came into our show.  You have a beer in your hand.  You seem looser.  You seem happier.  I wasn't happy last time.  I don't know.  Are you going through any personal things right now?  I'm having a good time.  What?  What are you trying to drag out of me?  I don't know.  Are you still married?  No, no.  I'm divorced.  Did that happen within the last four months?  About six months ago.  Okay.  That's it, then.  Why?  It's the bitches that'll get you. 
[01:36:00]  You seem happier.  Oh, yeah.  You were in here last time with Nikki.  We had a great time.  Yeah, we had a great time.  But you guys were a little too scared.  You didn't want the girls too close to you or anything.  They were making us keep the booze away from you.  All that fun stuff.  No, weren't they?  I was drinking here.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We had some Sam's.  Yeah.  The Sam Adams.  The Sam Adams.  Yeah, I was drinking the whole time.  All right.  Yeah, I think...  What was that?  What happened?  Because there was a quote in there from your ex, I guess. 
[01:36:30]  It said, oh, it was bad right from the start.  What?  15 months.  It said his 15-month marriage ended, and then she's got a quote.  There's a playboy playmate for divorce.  Siding irreconcilable difference.  It was a pretty bad setup from the get-go.  From the get-go?  From the get-go?  I mean, we were together for seven years.  I mean, when was the get-go?  You know, when the marriage started?  Yeah, the second the marriage starts is the get-go there, Vince.  Yeah, because, I mean, we were together a long time, and, you know, if it was from the get-go, she'd have left a long time ago. 
[01:37:00]  Did she nail you?  Did she get you pretty bad financially?  No.  The thing is, she got reamed.  Really?  Yeah, I just went to court with her.  Who's your lawyer?  I want her.  And my lawyer.  Son of a bitch.  My lawyer beat the crap out of these guys, and I ended up probably having the best divorce settlement in the history of divorces.  Bitch!  God damn it, I can't friggin' win.  She basically got almost nothing.  Nice.  And I kept everything.  Oh, how does that work? 
[01:37:30]  As she should have.  In California.  Yeah.  Which is the hardest.  A lot different than New York.  Oh, California's the hardest?  California's very hard.  Oh, California, you say hi to a girl on the street, and you're all the money.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  You look pretty today.  Nice dress.  Oh, Your Honor.  That's some kind of relationship.  God damn broads.  Vince, I tell you, I'm going through it.  I'm going through it, and it's killing me.  It's killing me.  Well, I'm just hanging out right now. 
[01:38:00]  Is that your first marriage?  Third.  What?  Are you a madman?  What the hell is wrong with you?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  You know.  You couldn't get me.  If they pulled my mother out of her house, put a knife to her throat, and said,  I'm slitting, unless you get married, I'd say, Mommy, bye.  Bye, Mom.  Can't do it.  Yeah, why would you do it again? 
[01:38:30]  I don't know.  And again.  And again.  I think the first one, I was just young.  I was 19 or something.  Let's give them one.  Everyone can get the one.  Yeah, okay.  I was young and very stupid.  You don't get the whole marriage thing.  The only reason I married her, because I had absolutely no money, and she had a car.  Ah.  You know, I needed a little transportation.  Everything in that.  Right.  And it was, you know, and she came from a wealthy family.  Love, transportation, whatever.  Yeah, I mean, I could sponge out her for a little while. 
[01:39:00]  Sure.  Okay.  The second one was, I used to hang out at this place in Los Angeles called the Hollywood  Tropicana.  You guys probably heard of it, the mud wrestling place.  Yep.  And one night, well, not one night, but I built a mud pit next to my swimming pool, and I got  that synthetic mud and stuff that they use at the mud wrestling joints.  So I'd have these parties at my house.  This is setting up to marriage, too?  Yes.  All right.  Maybe you changed gears there, but it makes it more interesting. 
[01:39:30]  Mud wrestling.  No, so I'd have all the mud wrestlers come over to my house, and just me and, like, a bunch  of my friends sit around and watch them wrestle each other.  And I ended up marrying one of the wrestlers.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And then that goes to the wayside.  Yeah.  And then you figure three times a charm.  Did you know going into number three, odds are this ain't going to last even?  No.  No, I mean, I didn't even, I didn't think about marriage at all.  We, um, I used to rent my Malibu house out to, uh, to, uh, to Penthouse Magazine and make 
[01:40:00]  pornos there.  They made pornos in his place, man.  Yeah.  And, uh, and if you've ever seen, uh, the movie, uh, They Came From Planet Butt, that was  at my house.  Not the They Came From Planet Butt.  Wow.  That had great cinematography.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  That was, uh, that was one of the, uh, main features at my house.  I can only imagine what the perks are of having them film a porno at your house.  As long as they're not wiping their mules on your curtains and stuff.  Yeah, right.  What the hell is this on there?  Yeah, we can, I put the sheets down. 
[01:40:30]  I got the special porno, uh, the porno laundry.  So, now, uh, obviously between the marriages, I guess, um, or, you know, during, I don't know  what the, the case is, uh, it seems like you're having a good time with pictures we see  in the magazines.  Yeah.  A couple of girls here and there.  But, jeez, you can't let that lead to the, the awfulness of marriage again.  Well, you know, I mean, when I, when I found my, uh, my third wife, Heidi, um, uh, they  were shooting a penthouse, uh, centerfold at the house. 
[01:41:00]  And then I was going through the, um, uh, the, the, the photographer, or the, the, the,  uh, makeup artist was, um, worked for Playboy, was moonlighting for Penthouse.  And she just showed me a bunch of Polaroids that she, they had just done on her, on her  last shoot.  Yeah, they always do that.  And it was, um, and it was, uh, the cover was pictures out.  Yeah.  The cover was, uh, the, the girls of Hooters.  And it was this, this, this girl on the, on the, uh, the, the cover girl.  And I go, yeah, I want to meet that one.  And so about two weeks later, uh, she called me on the phone.  We all say that, but he actually meets them, right? 
[01:41:30]  Uh, let me go through the pictures.  This one's hot.  I want to meet her.  And Hooters, good.  I could get wings out of it, too.  It's good.  Transportation wings.  We all say we want to meet him, but he gets to meet him.  And I'll defend his marriage three times.  You know, it's like, for me, I bang nothing but fours.  But when you're, when you're pulling Vince Neil ass, they're marriage material.  Yes, they are.  Fours.  Yeah.  For me to have a nine, it's, I got to have two.  And then, you know, cut a third of the one off. 
[01:42:00]  You poor bastard.  Yeah, the life, the life of a rock star.  Yeah, but no more, no more for me.  That's, that's it.  No?  I can't afford it, you know?  I mean, it's too much fun.  I mean, I'm 40 years old.  What do I want to go do that again for?  I hate the suffering I see.  You know, right now it's, it's fun just, just hanging out.  But I got three girls living at my house right now.  And it's, usually when you hear that, it's like, they're my daughters. 
[01:42:30]  And, you know, there's someone else's daughters.  No, they just had no place to go.  That's all.  It was just being a nice woman.  Yeah, letting them in.  Yeah.  That's good.  How do you work that?  Three?  How do they pay rent?  Like, what do they, yeah, right?  That's, that's the one right there.  I don't understand the arrangements.  If they're all living there at the same time, is it one big beddy-bye time?  Or do you, you know, you watch TV, you do this, and I'll be upstairs.  And when you hear the bed stop creaking, you can come in, and this one will stop. 
[01:43:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  Is it complicated?  You know, I'd like to say, yeah.  I mean, because that's the, that's the way it should be.  But, but it isn't.  And, you know, one, one girl is, she just lives there and takes care of the house when  I'm gone.  She just turned 20, I think.  Yeah, there you go, Vince.  There you go.  I was getting those, I want to get a, make sure she's a professional.  So, and had lots of experience.  Yeah.  She's experienced in being a teen.  That's about it.  And then, you know, the, the, the other two, like one just didn't have a place to go, 
[01:43:30]  so she's looking for a place.  And then the other one is, you know, I dig, so we'll see, you know, and it's all one big  happy family.  I'm sure any girl that just needed a place to stay, Vince would bring in.  If you want to stay at the house.  400 pounder.  Call us up and send you a picture.  I've actually prayed for a wayward woman.  Yeah.  With a drug problem and a black eye to show up in my house. 
[01:44:00]  So that doesn't happen.  I'm sure Vince would give you a few numbers.  No, no, no, I still got all my silverware.  I'm all going to say it was good.  You know how famous he is?  This is why I want to hang with Vince, because he's so famous.  He could tell a girl, all right, I'll talk to you, but you've got to give a hug to my friend.  And they would close their eyes and just finish me and hate me just to talk to you.  If you said so, Mr. Neal.  Well, those are a lot of the stories that you remember reading about and everything.  Like backstage at the crew shows, you'd get like some of these guys that just did lift 
[01:44:30]  an equipment and they'd have to, you know, the girls would have to work their way through  these lines to get backstage.  Yeah, you've got to start someplace.  You're winning the freaking rotary, the roadie lottery if you're working for these guys.  Imagine that.  Some poor saps lugging equipment for some hack.  It doesn't get anything.  And you're a roadie for the crew.  And, you know, they've got to get through them to get to you.  And the bad part is, maybe the good part, is you had to start with the truck drivers. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, God.  Jeez.  Oh, man.  I mean, you can't even work your way up to a roadie yet.  Oh, it starts with the truck drivers.  Imagine that.  What are you doing tonight?  Oh, my God.  I'm hauling the equipment for the crew.  Dude, we see that back in the, like during feel-good days, we had like 14 trucks.  And each truck driver would have a fishing pole.  They'd have a backstage pass on the end of the hook.  And they'd be sitting in their trucks going, zzzz. 
[01:45:30]  And the girls would be running after it.  And they're reeling it into the cab.  And it worked.  Classic.  That is great.  But, see, the thing is, though, those girls never really came back to see the band because  I think I want to be with a chick that was just with a truck driver.  No, those are the stories you hear about where you'd look out into the crowd and go,  all right, har, har, and then you'd get word to somebody to bring them back?  Yeah.  Is that how it works?  That's the way it works, generally.  God damn it.  An arena full of hot chicks. 
[01:46:00]  Some people have a...  You know the girls that came to see the crew.  Forget about it.  Some people have even, like, grids.  You know, like, marked out grids.  And go, you know, okay, B7, A14, G9, you know, and then it's bingo all the way, man.  It's good.  B5.  Well, the phones have exploded.  You hobbed my knob.  The phones have exploded here.  Let's talk to Greg.  Greg, what's up?  You're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, and hey.  Yo, Vince Neil, I have a question for you. 
[01:46:30]  I'm a huge fan.  I read the book about five times.  Hold on.  I got to tell you.  Isn't that one of the best rock books you've ever read?  It's the greatest.  It's the greatest.  It's like my Bible.  Like, me and my friends, like, use it as, like, a reference of what we do when we go out  and stuff like that.  Cool.  But I have a question.  Did you ever bang Pam Anderson?  It was like, because I know Tommy said that you didn't, but Nicky said you did, and then  you never said anything like if you did or not.  Well, I was staying neutral in that one.  Really?  Because that was right when the band was coming back.  But yeah, she got banged good. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Can I just smell your mule?  There's an exclusive for you.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Yeah, I always wanted that, too, because Tommy denied it in the book, and he said, no way.  It definitely happened.  He was married to her.  Tommy sucks, dude.  He's a poser now.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  I like it.  Thanks, dude.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, if you're married to her, you know.  Uh-oh.  My phones are ringing off the hook.  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're like, shut up. 
[01:47:30]  Vince, man.  I'm going to kick your ass.  Right.  I see you.  With my mule.  Okay.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  You're next on the OP&A.  Yo, what up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Just kneeling in the house?  Yeah.  Right here.  Hell yeah.  Yo, Vince.  I got to ask you a question, bro.  Yeah, are you a little pissed that your porno didn't sell as well as Tommy?  No.  Nah.  You know what?  Your porno.  Because when that thing came out, you know, I was with Heidi.  And I saw it as like, I mean, I didn't put that thing out. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  For one thing.  How did it get out?  Do you know?  Yeah, we know how Tommy's got out.  No, we know.  No, but I mean, Vince had a porn time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the one girl, not Janine, but the other girl, Brandy, she ended up with the film and  she saw some money and sold it.  So this thing came out and I didn't want anything to do with this thing.  Now, the way, you know, watching Tommy and Pam talk about it, talk about it, talk about  it.  I mean, it was in the paper.  Made it huger than you.  Yep.  I didn't talk about it at all.  And I just knew that it would just like be out and it would go away. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  I mean, hey, I mean, it wasn't, I wasn't, I didn't make any money out there, so what did  I care if it was big or not?  They were in courts with it and all you heard about it and then you were like, I gotta see  this thing.  Yeah.  Because you'd hear from people that saw it, oh my God, it looks like she's being hit with  a bat.  We saw it.  So you had to see it.  We saw it Thanksgiving Day at my family.  Did you?  Yeah, before Thanksgiving Day.  Before the turkey was ready, we all checked out, I swear to God, the video.  You, uh, with, uh, Pam, before, it was, uh, before or after, uh, Tommy? 
[01:49:00]  It was before, right?  Yeah, we just dated a few times.  Yeah, because I feel bad for the guy after.  Oh.  That's a tough act to follow when you watch that video.  That's like going on after Pryor.  Boris, what's up?  Yeah, um, a while back you had Nicky over there and they talked about the Motley Crue Challenge.  Do you think that you can get to go through the Motley Crue Challenge for, uh, this, pal?  Wouldn't that be great?  Oh, yeah, well, you've got to do it.  Well, we, uh, we, uh, picked up on the Motley Crue Challenge. 
[01:49:30]  Motley Crue Challenge, we have, um, the huge double-dung dildo.  Oh, oh, with the bill.  Yeah, with the dollar.  Yeah, with the dollar bill on the middle.  And we do it now on our show.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  It takes a special couple of girls to do it.  But, uh, yeah, we had a couple.  All right.  We had one girl.  Hit that bell.  Didn't the dollar disappear?  Yeah.  I think it came out as four quarters.  It was amazing to watch, though.  And a watch.  Yeah, and the watch.  Really amazing to watch the girls do that. 
[01:50:00]  But you guys, I mean, seen it all.  Jesus Christ.  I can only imagine the shenanigans going, uh, going down backstage at the crew shows.  What's like one of the...  There's got to be so many things, but there's got to be one thing that you always just go,  oh, yeah.  You know, something that happened, some freak show, sexploitation thing that, uh, took place  that you saw back then.  Worst thing?  I didn't even like to talk about it.  It was, uh, those are the best.  It was when, um, you probably read it in the book, where the, um, um, to come back and, 
[01:50:30]  and, and, uh, hang out with me and Nikki underneath the stage during, during the, uh, show.  We would call it the, uh, the, the kitty club.  And then we would have a, the girls would first have to, there was a sandbox there,  like a litter box.  Right.  They would first have to squat and pee in the litter box.  Oh, that's a great story.  Nice.  So the girls would actually use the litter box just like a cat would use a litter box at  home.  Yeah, can we figure any girl that would do that is, is worthy of coming back and hanging  out with us.  And wait, this is during the show.  I'm going to get so much hate mail from this thing. 
[01:51:00]  Nah, it was, ah, it was all a...  You bastard.  It was the time we were all living in.  Yeah.  Uh, this was during the show?  Yeah, it was like during the drum solo.  Like you guys would go down and this would happen.  All right, so the girls, they, uh, go in the cat box.  Yeah.  And then, uh, you, you guys would be watching this.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  We even had t-shirts made up about it.  You made a t-shirt?  Yeah, because, uh, and I'll tell you about the t-shirt in a second.  We had, um, uh, then they would come and they would, uh, you know, they would, they would, 
[01:51:30]  they would do us.  And then, but then we would, you know, when we, when we came, we'd...  Nice sign line with my wife.  Oh, my God!  Oh, I doubt that made the air, but, uh, well, and that's the kiddie club.  That's the kiddie club.  We have t-shirts made up with a, with a hand.  Right.  A hand cupping some, some milk.  Yeah.  And the girl, so, uh, for those of, uh, you at home that didn't quite hear that, we'll 
[01:52:00]  put it in terms that maybe you can understand.  Uh, when, when, uh, the girls, uh, would be with the guys and the guys would finish the  job, um, they would, uh, get the result of, of that in their hand.  Of the job.  Of the job.  Said job in their hand.  And the girl would lap it up like cream.  Like little, like little kittens.  O and A kitty club coming soon.  We, we're stealing that, Vince.  We're stealing. 
[01:52:30]  You, you asked for it.  We got it.  We got to at least do the cat box portion of it.  I'll actually lay on my back with sand on my face.  Would be the first time.  Shut up.  Vince is better than, uh, prep burger for our show.  I know.  Look at this.  Uh, Bill, you're next with, uh, Vince Neal.  Bill.  Oh, my God.  I heard him on.  Speak, you ass.  Dude, you.  You.  Nah.  Oh, my God.  Hey, hey.  Hey, you.  Yeah, you.  Hey. 
[01:53:00]  What are you doing, jackass?  Say something to Vince.  Hey.  Am I on?  You saying, hey, hey, am I on?  Yeah, hey.  Listen.  Douchebag.  I was on Rapid City, South Dakota, and I got backstage, and I saw, uh, some fat chick with  Nikki Sixx.  Is that true?  Did he bang her?  She's claimed she got anal from him.  Serious, dude.  Wait, does that mean that she yelled at him?  What?  It said she got anal with him.  Was she mad?  I don't know.  Pick up your socks.  She got it.  She was arranging the booze bottles. 
[01:53:30]  Just so.  You know what?  If she says it, I believe her.  All right.  Absolutely.  You wouldn't put it past him, right?  Sure.  Talk much after a gig, after you, you know, go through the gale, gal?  What?  What?  Do you talk much about who does what after, you know, after you go through the ladies?  Oh, after you're done, you talk about the night's festivities to each other and kind  of...  Well, yeah.  I mean, is that what...  Is that why you're doing it?  Sweet.  It's for brain.  Hey, one thing.  I got to know when you guys are coming out to, uh... 
[01:54:00]  How fat are they, sir?  They're not fat at all.  They're not...  This is not Vince Neil women we're talking about.  This might be seven Vince Neil women put in one.  How fat are these girls that want me?  They're not fat at all.  All right.  Have them email me at tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  Sweet.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  Thank you, mister.  Who knows what's making them in the air at this point?  Hey, uh...  Breaking news.  It's not even that late.  You know the lead singer of, uh...  Big Country there?  Yeah.  You know, in a big country...  Uh-huh.  He's dead. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  Wow.  What happened?  43 years old.  Discovered in a hotel Sunday in Hawaii?  Yep.  Oh, wow.  What do you think?  What do you think?  They said he had problems with alcohol and drugs.  Yeah.  Well, that's a problem when you end up dead.  That's a big drinking or drug problem.  Yeah, but Hawaii's okay, though.  Yeah, at least you're going in Hawaii.  That's nice, sir.  Had a good time.  It's not like you're under a dumpster somewhere.  You're in Manhattan.  Hey, look, it could be Harry Chapin on the LIE.  Oh, God. 
[01:55:00]  It's true.  Yeah, that's a bad way to go, man.  In a fiery car crash.  Jeez.  Keith, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I had a story, uh...  Oh, my God.  What's up with everyone today?  I had a story with a friend of mine,  and he knew a guy who hooked up with a guy from the band Heavy Petting.  Could you take it down a notch, sir?  Dude, we got some really good energy today, so can you help us out?  I'm trying to get away from the kids.  I don't want them to hear the story.  I'm with Vince. 
[01:55:30]  Vince?  We're going to go back to him.  He's with his kids.  Eric, what's up?  Oh, uh...  I just wanted to ask Vince, uh...  You didn't sleep in that bed after these guys, like, after they had sex there.  Oh, the porn guys.  After they filmed porn?  Yeah, they probably bring...  No, no, they brought in their own stuff.  Oh, you...  Absolutely not.  I was going to say, you didn't use your own match.  No, no, no, no.  It's professionals.  Yeah, no.  I guess...  I was telling these guys, I had a whole, like, laundry full of...  Like, Norton would sleep on afterwards.  Yes, I would, sir.  And for...  Yes, because they filmed a film in my house, I would definitely sleep on it. 
[01:56:00]  Norton, you are sick and disgusting, and I friggin' love it.  Thank you, sir, but it wouldn't bother me.  Believe me, if Magic Johnson and Arthur Ashe did a film on my pillow, I'd sleep on it.  Oh, God.  You guys suck.  You are horrible, man.  But you know he's not lying.  I know.  That's the sick part about it.  Derek, what's up?  Hey, Vince, I just wanted to know, was this like a creative writing session before the shows  to figure out what these girls are going to do to come back, to hang out back, and is  there anything left for you to experience? 
[01:56:30]  I'm sure there's something out there.  He's trying.  He'll try that.  I mean, do you guys sit around like the Letterman show and sit there like, oh, yeah, this would  be cool for her to do?  No, I think it's just like people go out, like if somebody's probably at Home Depot and  saw a litter box and go, eh, we could use this.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  Would the girls scoop their own stuff out of the litter box, or would one of the guys  do it?  Sometimes he would.  Yeah.  You know, usually it would be the stage manager.  But he liked it. 
[01:57:00]  We've got to get that.  With the little scooper.  We've got to do that here.  We've got to do that here.  We've got to get that in our next contract, Dan.  Can we do that?  Litter boxes.  Yeah.  And that stuff that dries up, you know, hard and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Scoopable.  Yeah.  And you can actually label them.  Goddamn, that's beautiful.  Those little glad baggies.  Yeah.  Remember the tour.  Yeah, I could hang them up right over here, you know, and with Polaroids open up the baggie.  Yeah.  I remember that tour.  Yeah, she liked asparagus. 
[01:57:30]  This is a rock star.  This is a rock star.  What happened to our rock and roll?  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, Obi and Anthony?  Vince, what's up?  Hey.  I saw you two nights ago on Long Island.  A great show.  Oh, yeah.  That was a great one, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, excellent.  Listen, I just heard on a recent interview that Nicky had that you were getting in touch  with Tommy.  Is there any truth to that rumor or no?  That I was getting in touch with Tommy?  Yeah.  No, not that I've heard of.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Are you guys all hating each other again?  No, no, no, no, no.  Me and Nicky talk all the time, and I just saw him and Mick about a month ago, and, you 
[01:58:00]  know, that's about it.  I don't know as far as the getting in touch with Tommy thing's all about.  Is Mick that effed up?  Yeah, yeah.  It's just...  No, as far as he barely can play or anything anymore.  Yeah, no, I mean, he's still playing good, but what is it?  His neck is just really screwed up, and so, like, he can't turn his head like this, but  he has to turn kind of like, you know, like if it was just a straight line, and it's  just one of those things that you get, I guess.  I don't know. 
[01:58:30]  He's going through a lot of therapy, and...  It's a disease, right?  Yeah.  It's like a bone disease.  Don't the joints harden or something like that, so you don't have mobility in them?  That's exactly it, yeah.  Yeah, but all the chits you've been through...  It kind of like fumes us together.  You're lucky you all don't have some kind of bone disease.  Jesus Christ.  I think you have medicine for that.  Yeah.  I got pills for that bone.  The disease of that bone.  The old flesh bone.  So, you're on the outs with Tommy or something, I guess. 
[01:59:00]  Well, I haven't talked to him in years.  In years, huh?  You know, he's doing...  He's a rapper.  Yeah.  That's a little weird.  You know?  Awful.  Like, I remember seeing the interviews with the crew and stuff, and it seemed like that  was Tommy, and now he's just...  You know, he did that episode of Cribs on MTV where he went through the house.  That was a cool pad.  Yeah, he's got...  It looks like some kind of a wacky amusement park.  Tommy Land.  Yeah, and yeah, he was all ghetto and stuff.  Yeah, but it's Tommy and Pam Land. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so he finished the settlement.  And I don't want to see the kids' room.  I don't want to see the kids' room.  You know?  That's not my impression of what it's all about.  And yeah, it seems like he's a lot more ghetto now or something.  I don't know.  It's kind of weird.  It's quite...  Yeah.  Sup?  Yo.  My boys.  Chef, what's going on?  Woo!  That's you, baby!  What's going on?  Or nothing.  There he is.  Energy guy. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, man.  I only know crew one way, and that's loud and crude.  I've been a fan since 82, the leather version of Two Fats for Love.  I'm on Motley.com.  We got our own little thing, Syncorp, going.  And, you know, I only had two questions for you.  Whether or not Tommy comes back, I don't care.  I just want to see crew back on the road.  I was wondering when that would happen.  Saw the other night at the Thunderdome in Baltimore.  Awesome show.  And I was wondering if there's any way you might be able to send me an autographed pic of yourself. 
[02:00:30]  Okay.  First question.  Sorry, dude.  Wow.  I'm 30 years old.  You walk into my room, and it's still Motley Crue brew, Motley Crue posters.  People are like, dude.  I'm like, you don't understand.  This is the best rock and roll band that ever walked me hurt.  Wait a minute.  This is Sebastian Bach.  Wow.  That'll leave a bruise.  That's good. 
[02:01:00]  I forgot what you asked.  I know.  It was 20-part questions.  Crew getting back together.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We're, you know, we just wanted to take this year off.  And, you know, Nicky wanted to spend time with his family and stuff.  And it looks like we're going to, like, probably, like, around March get back together, start writing songs.  And, you know, start getting things back together for the record.  And probably, like, next Christmas release.  And that'll be, like, a tour in 2003.  Nice. 
[02:01:30]  Awesome.  I'm kind of like a crackhead without any new crew out there.  And seeing you at the Thunderdome the other night was, like, my fix.  Well, cool, man.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  Hey, is there any way I might be able to, you guys might be able to send me an autographed picture?  I'm sure there's a way.  Of Norton?  Hold on.  Hold on.  We'll try to figure it out, Jeff.  We'll see what happens.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, man.  Vince, good luck to you, man.  Keep going.  I love you guys.  Thanks, bro.  Hey, we've got to take a break.  Hardcore fans, man.  What's your deal?  You have to leave?  I mean, it's up to you.  I just got some chicks coming back to the hotel in a little bit. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, I'd leave, though.  But I'll be good.  We're going to hang for a while.  All right, you can hang.  Cool.  Vince Neal in the house, Anthony.  And we'll be back.  Welcome to the bottomless cage of ignorance.  I feel like being an idiot, Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Acting hilarious.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:02:30]  Vince Neal in the studio, Ant.  Yes.  Playing B.B. Kings tonight in New York City, by the way.  We forgot about that.  Sorry.  I got a little sidetrack.  How many girls were you slamming when you were recording this song?  I just picture him by the mic, and there's a girl filleting him.  That stuff was going on, too, back then.  Not many of this song, but the sessions.  Just doing girls in between takes, right?  Or sometimes during.  Sometimes during.  Yeah, that happens.  You have songs out there that...  Wow, that's cool. 
[02:03:00]  There's one song on the Dr. Feelgood album.  Which song was it?  It starts with a zipper.  Um, she goes down.  Okay.  And, um, in the...  If you, like, stripped it down, you could actually hear, um...  We went and got...  We did it in Vancouver, where prostitution is legal.  So we went and got a couple prostitutes for...  Just for noise things, and we mic'd them while they were doing things.  Is it legal there?  Yeah, it's legal there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Norton's new home.  You're moving? 
[02:03:30]  You're moving, Jim?  I got a Hummer in an alley in Vancouver with my last 80 American dollars, and this other  one came over and goes, you could pat my bum for 20.  So I gave her 20, and I patted her bum while the other one finished the job.  In an alley.  In an alley.  It's such a class.  1990.  Dirty boy.  Class act.  Filthy.  Anthony, this whole interview, or whatever you call it, started with you handing over  the Blender magazine to Vince?  Yeah, we found two other references to Vince in that magazine.  Besides the pictures of him making out with two girls and passing out while the magazine... 
[02:04:00]  No, I was resting.  I know, but the magazine makes it look like you passed off.  Yeah, two girls.  I was just stunning myself.  And then there's another picture of you, a huge picture, taken in what, 80...  It was...  I had my Shout the Devil backstage pass on.  Yeah.  It was 1984.  84.  And you're holding a big bottle of Jack Daniels, and it says, does rehab work?  Does rehab work?  That's great.  And the other one is a quote on the cover.  What's that quote?  Yeah, this is like a little article inside the rehab thing.  It was on the cover.  I vomited on Kelsey Grammer.  You did? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to hear...  What happened there?  Well, I didn't puke just right on him, but me and him were...  This is when he drank.  Yeah, oh, and we all know how responsible he was when he drank.  So, yeah, me and him were drinking at a bar in Malibu, and I don't know, I was drinking  some really weird stuff, man.  I just remember it was just...  It just hit me wrong, and I just puked all over his shoes.  It was... 
[02:05:00]  What is Kelsey doing?  You throw up on his feet.  He was being very nice about it.  Was he?  He was as screwed up as I was.  I didn't even think he realized it for a while.  Normally, he goes home and bangs the babysitter.  Hey, you know, two people have died since Vince has been in the studio.  He probably woke up and looked at his shoes and went, oh, I got sick last night.  Throw up on his shoes.  We announced that the lead singer of Big Country died.  Yeah.  And now the creator of Casper the Friendly Ghost is dead. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  People are dying as Vince is in the studio.  They're going to be.  Yeah.  But he was like 83 or whatever.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to John.  John.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  One of the worst Christmas gifts I ever got was a Guns N' Roses biography book, and there's  a pretty big story in there about Axl Rose kicking his ass one time backstage.  I want to know how true that was.  About Axl Rose kicking my ass?  Yeah.  He said he just got into a flight.  He offered you out and stuff like that.  Oh, boy. 
[02:06:00]  Well, I can go on and on about this one.  I don't know if Axl would kick anyone's ass.  No.  It's true.  I punched out Izzy.  Okay.  He was at the MTV Awards.  Yeah.  But he had it coming to him, and he knew he had it coming to him, because I was river  rafting in Idaho, and he punched my wife, Cherise.  He punched her in the stomach.  He punched her?  Why?  What the hell did he do that for?  Well, he was drunk.  He was making...  I freaked.  I said, next time I see him, he's going down.  That was the next time I saw him. 
[02:06:30]  Well, the story's completely different in the book.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, let me tell you what really happened.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, because this is too good.  Hold on.  Let him dump out of that.  All right.  I know.  Isn't it like a real relaxed hangout atmosphere where the F word can fly around?  I mean, it was like four seconds every time they dump, but so you saw him, and you said  get the F out of here?  Yeah.  Okay.  No, no, no, the security guards told me to get out because it was Tom Petty and all  these people were hanging around, and Izzy's laying on the ground. 
[02:07:00]  And so I'm going out to my car, right up backstage, and then Axel comes out.  He's like, you can do that?  And I go, oh, yeah, I can.  But then the security guards, you know, separated us.  Yeah.  You know, there was no swings blown or anything.  Then he goes to the press.  He's talking this and that, said that I sucker punched Izzy, which I didn't do.  So I looked him right in the eye and said, you know, you touch my wife next time, I'll  kill you.  And then I thought, no, I'm sorry. 
[02:07:30]  Then I didn't say it.  All right.  Then I got him.  Then you got him.  You left the K out that time.  But as far as the Axel thing, he's going on and on and on.  And I go, all right, let's meet at Tower Records.  Let's go do it here.  Let's go do it here.  He never showed up.  And then I finally go, you know what?  You got to put up this time.  At the forum in Los Angeles, they had Monday night fights, you know, every Monday night. 
[02:08:00]  And I said, and I went to MTV with this thing.  I go, look.  And I went to Axel with this.  I go, okay, I'll tell you what.  But if you think that you can take me, we'll do three rounds in fight night at the forum  and have MTV televise it.  You know, then it's like, you know, put up or shut up.  Right.  Here you go.  Everyone's going to watch who gets their ass kicked.  So he goes, no, I don't want to do it.  I mean, so whatever his side of the story was, was complete bull.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's the way it went down.  All right.  Thanks.  All right. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, I thought we were, I forgot I was talking to.  Yeah, right.  All the beers are, you know.  You should handle it like the rappers and just shoot each other dead.  Yeah.  It seems to work.  It settles all arguments.  The dead guy lost.  Yeah.  It's pretty much the way it is.  No stories in magazines or papers to argue with.  Ryan, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Vince, when was the last time you were at the Playboy Mansion and tell me about the  details?  There you go, Scott.  Whip it out.  Get your Vaseline and he'll tell you. 
[02:09:00]  Last time I was there was Halloween night.  Oh, that had to be a hell of a part.  And the cool thing about Halloween night is.  I think we got the video.  Is he in the video?  We got some video.  Got a video.  It's like back, behind the scenes at the mansion video.  Yeah.  They put it out.  Yeah, I've seen those.  It's just hot girls dancing around and failing anything.  Well, most of the girls, too.  You know, instead of putting on costumes for Halloween.  They just paint them on.  They just paint themselves.  Yeah.  So it's just very cool.  With this past Halloween you were there?  Yeah.  And the Halloween before.  So you still got a great relationship with Hugh Hefner? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  I'm going New Year's Eve.  Can I go?  Yeah, it's black tie and lingerie.  Can we go?  Can we go?  Yes, please.  Yeah, we'll sneak it out.  I'll go.  We'll go.  Yeah, we'll get like a big, like a three-headed tuxedo or something.  Yeah, make it like a costume.  Well, you can.  I'm never going there.  Am I kidding?  You can just bring me and say I'm your mule holder.  Just hold his junk the whole way.  Miss, would you care? 
[02:10:00]  The man, bro.  You want to partake?  Take a little swig, would you?  Hey, Brian, is that it?  Anything else for him?  You guys still talk to the Larry Flints of the world?  To the Larry Flints of the world?  We talk to Larry every once in a while.  You still talk to him?  Yeah, why?  I just, you know, it's that he's, I think he gets a little more involved in like the Hugh Hefner's.  Anything you guys ever done with, you know, been around him, everything's been, you know.  I know in his publications you could see what the girls had for lunch a little more than you can. 
[02:10:30]  No, Playboy's great.  All right, thank you.  I don't know where he was getting at it.  It was secret messages that the UFO was beaming him.  Howie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Vince, are you liking the Disturbed or what are you listening to nowadays?  That's good.  We love the Disturbed.  I'm into Disturbed.  Yeah, I listen to Disturbed all the time.  I love the new songs.  That's insane.  Hey, thanks for putting that Kickstart My Heart on that NASCAR CD. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, was that on there?  Yeah, you didn't hear that?  He's not getting paid for it.  Cool.  Oh, no.  Cool.  I want to hear my song on the radio tolls.  Bye.  Later, man.  See ya.  What do you think of today's music?  I think there's a lot of stuff that I don't like out there.  Yeah.  You know, it's...  What?  Some of the stuff just sounds just old.  Not old, but it just...  Nobody does anything different.  Everybody steals from somebody who just went away.  And it's...  The new thing is to sound like Creed.  There's a lot of bands sounding like Creed now. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, well, they shouldn't.  That's pretty...  Yeah.  Yeah, they really shouldn't.  That generic, supposed to sound this way sound.  Yeah.  Yeah, that kind of sucks.  Well, there's really no lyrics.  There's just one...  Yeah, where's the accent from?  Why are you singing like that?  All right.  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, hey.  Hey.  He's drinking.  It's not like...  Who the hell is that?  Hello?  Yeah.  What's up, Steve?  Yeah, I'm drinking.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Vince, who's toughest in that band you got there? 
[02:12:00]  You ever come to blows within the band?  Yeah.  In Motley?  Yeah.  Or who have you seen that's gone toe-to-toe with, you know, other people like you've mentioned,  like, you know...  They all seem psychotic.  I mean, most bands don't go around and beat up each other.  Yeah.  But in a band, you know, you're living with the same guys for 20 years, you know, in tour buses  and hotel rooms.  It's just, you know, you're like brothers.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, one day, you know, you didn't squeeze a toothpaste right, and you're 
[02:12:30]  going to go to blows.  Shut the F up, man.  Shut the F up.  Shut down.  Who can endure the most, though?  Who can stand up and take a beating?  Well, it's not like we go, like, 16 rounds or anything.  It's like...  Right.  You know, shove somebody against a wall or punch somebody, and it's over with.  It's over with.  You never came to blows, though, with anyone else?  Like, what's the closest to any pushing or...  Well, yeah.  I mean, I've gone to blows with Nicky and with Tommy.  Nicky's gone to blows with Tommy and Mick. 
[02:13:00]  You know, it's...  And whoever they've done, I don't know.  But...  It's just like, sorry, man.  Oh, wait, wait.  Sorry, man.  Nicky had Malcolm Young up by the neck, hanging from a wall once.  Jesus.  So it was my turn to scoop the cat box, son of a bitch.  Matt from West Isop.  All I want to know is, since the first record hit, what is the longest amount of time between women?  Has he ever gone one day in the past ten years without a chick? 
[02:13:30]  There you go.  The longest without a woman?  I don't know.  I guess when I was in rehab...  No.  Nah.  God damn.  Because I forget about the sex addict girls that are in there.  Have you ever tried...  I'm like, I got schlonged.  Have you ever tried counting?  No.  I mean, what would you say?  About the top...  Top of your... 
[02:14:00]  Ballpark estimate of the whole number?  Yeah.  How many girls in your life?  Oh, I don't...  I have no idea.  We've been...  I've been together for, what, 20 years?  Count the grains of sand on a beach, Opie.  What are you asking this man?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It doesn't really matter.  It does to us.  Yeah, it does.  We live through you.  God damn you.  Okay, you guys come up with a number, and I'll see who comes the closest, and then...  Ten thousand.  They win a prize.  You know there's a comma in it, though. 
[02:14:30]  A couple.  There's definitely a comma in it.  God bless you.  Jesus Christ.  You don't realize how much your numbers suck until you sit next to a real rock star.  I stink.  They probably don't get out of that.  Of course they did.  Darn it.  You can't speak freely.  We should let Vince get back to the hotel.  He's got women waiting for him.  Women back there, man.  Jesus.  And he's playing B.B. Kings tonight, right here in New York City.  Yeah, you guys.  Hey, thanks for having me back again. 
[02:15:00]  I love coming here with you guys.  Yeah, it's a thing.  It's always a blast.  We had women, but what happened, Steve?  We had two of the ones from that five-girl orgy, and he booked for today, and at nine o'clock  they backed out.  Ah, bitches.  We had a really good orgy.  We had.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  See, we just talked.  I know.  He doesn't believe it.  I've got video.  If Vince wants a video, he can have it.  I think Vince has enough video.  Sorry.  Know who got to check it out?  Vanilla Ice. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, Vanilla Ice was sitting in here watching the whole thing.  Vanilla Ice gets the gangbang, and Vince gets...  I get you guys in a magazine.  Yeah.  Right.  What a room full of duds.  We had a gal that was going to come up and flash you.  What a room full of queers.  See, now I just got to go over to Hooters next door just to make sure that it's...  We had a lesbian orgy going on for Vanilla Ice.  Oh, well.  Vince gets this.  Sorry, Vince.  Gets a sausage factory. 
[02:16:00]  Well, Vince, thank you.  Thanks again, you guys.  Thanks, Neil, everyone.  Thanks.  Opie and Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Ponderous.  Effin' ponderous.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  That was fun with Vince, huh?  Unbelievable.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  The story's hard to believe, but you just know they're true.  Yeah, it's one of those stories that, like, if your friend was telling you at a bar, he'd be the BS guy. 
[02:16:30]  And you'd all be like, oh, I can't believe that crap this guy has.  He's bold.  But Vince is telling him.  So you're like, yeah, oh, my God, that happened.  Just if you were in your basement at a party and you put out a cat box and a girl at the party went in the cat box,  that would be like, oh, my God, I can't believe she's doing that.  Now, not only is that happening, but they had just come off a stage with thousands of fans in front of them playing their music,  and they're going to go back on that stage and have the adulations of their fans. 
[02:17:00]  What a life.  Cat litter box, though.  Yeah, we could do that one.  And we should.  It's a blatant robbery of what they were doing.  No, no, no, but Motley Crue is our prep burger.  Yeah, they gave us the Motley Crue challenge.  We can call it the Motley Crue kitty litter box.  Yeah, as long as we have Motley Crue in the title of the bit.  No problem. 
[02:17:30]  That's one of the franchising rules.  You've got to put their name in it.  Right.  So if we franchise out the cat box thing, teen cat box.  Oh, my God.  Do you think we'd get teen girls to do that in a cat box?  Teen cat, yes.  Yes, we can do that.  They could drink water.  Teen cat litter box.  This is a chance for the girls to prove me wrong.  To prove me wrong.  I have said this.  Anthony, the only way it works is with teen.  Teen, right. 
[02:18:00]  Teen.  Not necessarily.  No.  Oh, no, no.  Anybody with a full panel?  No, it's got to be teen.  All right.  It's got to be teen.  You're right.  You're right.  Teen cat litter box.  Look, Friday, we had more guys than the show could handle.  And I don't mean it that way, so shut up.  Out there, and they were filling up balloons after drinking a lot of water.  And they kept showing up.  We had to turn them away.  That many guys, huh?  Yeah.  With Steve running around, I only have two hands. 
[02:18:30]  Nice callback.  That's great.  That's why you've got to listen longer to the Opie and Anthony show.  Linger longer.  We don't have to explain every single line after it's said.  Nice.  Good callback.  Thank you.  But now we want the girls to get involved.  Someone wants us to call it the Motley Poo.  No, it's not that.  That's disgusting.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  We all have to be on the same page.  And you never get a girl to do that.  Oh, you might.  We are looking for girls 18 and 19 years old. 
[02:19:00]  And it depends.  I think some of the cities that we broadcast to are the ages younger.  We'll get on planes.  We'll get on planes if we have to.  Could you imagine a big sandbox right in the corner?  Girls drinking water, whatever.  And they're going, okay, I'm ready.  And we mic it.  And you hear that sound.  Yeah.  We have a...  First... 
[02:19:30]  Because they've got to dig the hole.  Yeah, they've got to dig the hole with their little hands.  With their little teen fingers.  Yeah.  Just working through that sand.  With the chipped nail polish.  The sand just holding all that yellow goodness.  Oh.  Oh.  You know, we have to make this happen.  Because the last time we had Vince in here...  Retro teen jewelry on those fingers.  Yeah.  We had...  Last time we had Vince and Nicky in here...  Yeah.  They gave us a bit. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, they did.  Vince just gave us another bit.  So now we have to make it happen.  And I think we need to make it happen before we go on our little Christmas break Wednesday.  Wow.  After Wednesday.  Teen girls.  Cat litter box.  We're asking for you.  Why is it tough, Rick?  Girls that aren't shy.  You don't have to do anything but drink a lot of water and use the cat box.  That's it.  We have to.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that, though.  Right in the corner there.  Yes. 
[02:20:30]  Set up the sandbox.  We have audio of the...  We have audio of the Xbox competition from Friday, Anthony.  Great.  Well, Norton wasn't here.  I heard part of it.  It wasn't quite gay enough for my taste.  Did you hear when the...  What gay taste do you like?  You want to hear the guy puking or when the balloon popped?  Is neither an option?  The audio of the... 
[02:21:00]  This guy was going to win the contest.  He was the go-ahead winner.  After over three hours, he had a nice-sized balloon, but he had it in his pants for some  reason.  He was shy, and he didn't want his junk hanging out.  So he put everything inside his clothing and filled the balloon up that way.  Then, when it was done, he tied it off very carefully, and then he had to pull it out of  his clothes.  Lost it.  Boy, he didn't have a dominating mother.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't show your pee-pee.  It's dirty.  Hey, by the way, there's a guy or a girl on the line, Terry. 
[02:21:30]  So, Chick with the biggest clump wins a prize.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Clumping litter.  We weigh it.  They scoop it out, and you weigh it.  Ooh.  Come on.  That's right.  Who else could tell we're really close to vacation?  We're losing our minds.  Yeah.  It's like in school.  Close to vacation.  Yeah.  When you're into work, you just F off.  All right.  Here's the guy.  So, he was going to win.  All he had to do was get this damn balloon thing out of his shorts.  And then it started moving around like mercury.  Yeah.  And he couldn't keep it under control, and it popped, and this is what happened. 
[02:22:00]  Let us know how the guy that kept it in his shorts is doing, because...  Oh, wow.  What happened?  It looks like a huge volleyball-sized tumor.  Oh, what?  The guy that...  Charlie, yeah.  The guy that was covering it the whole time?  Yep.  Did he successfully get it out?  He's still trying to maneuver.  This could be interesting.  This could affect the final outcome.  Oh, it looks like he pulled it off.  Oh.  All right.  He's tying off, right?  Tying off.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Okay. 
[02:22:30]  Something bad just happened.  All right.  That's...  That's...  The girls are running in.  Dude, something really bad just happened.  Oh, my God!  All right.  All I got is...  The girls, naked girls, are running in here.  Oh, my God!  Naked girls is right into the studio, so...  It's like the Hindenburg exploded, I think.  Got it.  Look, the girls are horrified.  They can't even tell us what happened.  Wow!  Ladies, get on the mic.  Hold on, Rick.  I want the ladies to tell us.  Don't, don't...  Back in the pool.  All I know is the door opening.  Ladies, grab the mic.  And naked girls came running into the studio. 
[02:23:00]  Don't tell us...  You got a leak!  Don't tell us what went anywhere, but just give us a description of what you saw, what  happened.  Yeah, talk into that mic, ladies.  Grab it down there.  First, should I ask you, habla English?  Si.  Ah, I'm kidding, of course.  No, they exploded.  Talk right into the mic.  They completely exploded out there.  How many?  Yeah, they're in that kiddie pool.  Yeah.  The balloons, let's say.  The balloons.  They popped?  How many popped?  Yeah, I think he actually dropped it.  Did he drop it? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, my God.  And it was the guy that had the most?  See?  It's very difficult.  Stay in that pool.  Hey, Rick.  Let me go to Rick.  Stay in the pool for right now.  Hey, Rick.  Holy.  Yo.  Rick, what happened?  One of the final guys, Kevin...  One of the guys that may have won the competition?  He had a lot, or talking a lot of fluid in his balloon.  Yeah.  And it was the guy that I said looks like deformed. 
[02:24:00]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And just as he was trying to maneuver it out, it slipped in between his legs.  His leg and his underwear.  And as he tried to squeeze his knees to catch it...  Oh, no!  It exploded.  Oh, what a great end.  So now...  We have great endings, Dawson.  Oh, that's great.  And there you have it from Friday.  Oh, man, that poor guy.  He was winning.  He was ahead.  Would have been the winner.  Had it.  Tried to pull it out, and it broke. 
[02:24:30]  The video's great, too.  That's Unfoundry, right?  I think it is.  Yeah.  Unfoundrymusic.com.  I got a Jim Norton commercial in front of me.  What is this about?  It's going to be fixed.  I'm doing a gig in Philly, January 25th.  The tickets haven't gone on sale.  Go on, self-right.  And this is the commercial they sent my agent, and they thought that this...  Because I just sent a Comedy Central tape with sound bites and stuff, because we're also  not going to send.  And this was what they came up with. 
[02:25:00]  And just rest assured.  We bleeped it out, the location, because it's the inaccurate location.  Wrong venue.  And it just really bugged me.  It's not you.  I didn't create the commercial.  No.  Anyone that knows you...  So the guy that created the commercial doesn't know you, probably.  Yeah.  He certainly doesn't.  Okay.  He got a tape of me.  Yeah, okay.  Is this entertaining?  No.  It might be, though.  He hates this commercial.  Let's take a listen.  So this is a commercial for your upcoming gig.  And don't go to commercial anywhere else.  No, no. 
[02:25:30]  Don't go to commercial.  Anytime we play a commercial to talk about, they go to commercial.  Yeah, no.  We're still doing our radio show.  So let's just...  We're going to stop the tape when it gets silly, okay?  Yeah, immediately.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony story.  All right.  It's silly already.  It's silly already.  The voice.  Yeah.  You know him.  That's the same guy that went Motley Crue.  At Madison Square Garden.  That's the voice guy.  Yeah, that doesn't...  Awful.  Does he start getting wacky?  Just enjoy. 
[02:26:00]  Okay.  Norton.  And he's ready to raise some hell.  Now he's on his...  They're going to raise hell!  Are you raising hell?  Yeah, I want everybody...  It's so awful!  He's ready to raise hell.  Hey, guys.  Let's change that to heck.  Ten tons of mud down and dirty in the bog.  He's ready to raise...  Raise hell.  I'm going to walk out to that song.  Da-na-na-na.  Hey!  You bag of male spunk.  That is absolutely an unacceptable commercial. 
[02:26:30]  That's the same guy that goes,  Bigfoot against Gravedigger.  Right.  And he's ready to raise hell.  ACDC.  One night only.  Oh, that...  How awful is that?  He's ready to raise hell.  I want everybody to bring those, like,  styrofoam hands with the finger for number one.  We could all raise hell together.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you're sitting there going,  Wait a minute.  He's not raising hell.  No, he's doing jokes.  He's doing jokes. 
[02:27:00]  Funny guy.  Raising hell.  Well, let's...  I'm not Kiss in 1977.  I'm a meaty-breasted little nothing  with an hour of material.  Special guest Paul guy.  All right, well, let's take a little listen here.  To the...  January 22nd.  Here comes...  One date.  Jim Norton.  I hate skiing, and if you're killed doing it...  Good.  Thanks.  Jim Norton.  The Yellow Discipline Tour. 
[02:27:30]  No way.  You're calling it the Yellow Discipline Tour.  Oh, that rocks.  That's my choice.  Now, that rocks.  Yes.  See, you saw the natural laugh.  That's funny.  The Yellow Discipline Tour.  It's January 25th, not the 25th.  With Molly Hatchett.  And Charlie Daniels Band.  The Yellow Discipline.  At the Long Island Arena.  Nice.  Raising hell.  All right, let's keep listening.  There's nothing open.  I'm like, all right.  I'll call an escort service.  A thousand dollars?  And she's like, well, she's really pretty. 
[02:28:00]  Wait a minute.  What happened there?  I'll tell you what happened there.  Because what you want to do when you have a one-minute commercial is take a bit with  a lot of pauses in it and cut the words together.  You know, escort service.  A thousand dollars?  Because that's how I deliver the joke.  I don't do any natural speaking in that.  Right, right.  I just go, you know, and you don't want to get to quick lines.  You don't need to set up.  You do quick lines. 
[02:28:30]  The whole thing will be redone.  After hearing it on the radio, I wouldn't buy tickets to see me if I heard that.  Wait, Greg wants it on.  You know, an escort service.  A thousand dollars?  Because that's the way I'm going to talk on stage.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I want to know if there's going to be a demo derby before a Norton show.  Demolition derby.  A stuntman will be dropped in a Buick-less saber right in the middle of the arena.  I also wanted to know if that robot that crushes cars and shoots fire out of the boat is going to be there. 
[02:29:00]  Truckasaurus.  I love that.  Fire-breathing car-crushing madness.  Truckasaurus.  And Jim Norton raising hell.  All right.  Is there more to this?  I hope not.  It's an annoying laugh.  Anthony just walked in.  Don't touch me.  What is Johnny Race doing?  Was he rubbing your back?  Yeah, rubbing my shoulders.  Johnny, why are you massaging Jim Norton?  Massaging.  Hey, you're the man.  You're the man. 
[02:29:30]  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll, baby.  Was that the way he yelled rock and roll at the nice restaurant the other night?  And after you mentioned it, after the show.  I swear to God, we're running a bar at this point.  People are listening at home going, wait, I didn't know all these people were just hanging out in this bar.  We have about 20 people in here.  Listen to me, when Opie announced it the day after the Ace Frehley show at the WTC, I'm sorry, Ace Frehley show,  but the New York Metal show with Eddie Trunk, and thank you, Eddie Trunk.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:30:00]  I didn't mean, you know, Earl came in since Johnny Race, and I screamed rock and roll, like I usually do,  but it was so loud that, I mean, I did not realize how loud it was,  and Opie's like, the place thought it was being held up.  I was like, oh, Jesus.  And, you know, my buddy that was with me, George Zendesk, I'm like, he goes, yeah, you were very loud.  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Rock and roll. 
[02:30:30]  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  All right, now we've got to start Jim Norton's commercial over.  Let's hear it up until the point we were at.  Yeah.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show.  He is Jim Norton, and he's ready to raise some hell.  Now he's on his way to the...  January 22nd.  Here comes Jim Norton.  I hate skiing, and if you're killed doing it, good.  Thanks.  Jim Norton, the Yellow Discipline Tour.  There's nothing open.  I'm like, all right, I'll call an escort service. 
[02:31:00]  $1,000?  And she's like, well, she's really pretty.  Wow.  Pete, none of this is good.  What?  That's got $1,000?  Yeah, I know.  And then they put the bit, like, you have pauses and bits.  Yeah.  Which is fine on stage, but when you have 60 seconds on a commercial, like, you know,  if you're killed skiing...  Quick hits, right.  Quick hits.  Hate skiing, if you're killed doing it, good.  Boom.  Next.  You stink.  You stink.  Boom.  Don't touch me. 
[02:31:30]  Boom.  Wait, Eric's got a comment.  Eric, go ahead.  Yeah, I was wondering, do they sell you the whole seat to the Jim Norton show, but you  only need the edge?  God damn.  Exactly, dude.  That's good, Ron.  That's beautiful.  That's funny.  And you're right.  That's exactly the vibe of that awful commercial.  Delsner, Slater, Vaughn, and Ruffino bring you Jim Norton, Raising Hell.  It's he's Jim Norton. 
[02:32:00]  He's Jim Norton.  Raising Hell.  You know him from the Opie and Anthony show.  He's Jim Norton.  He's Jim Norton.  He's Jim Norton.  Will I get to cut her head off and keep it when I'm finished?  One night only.  January 22nd.  I'm a...  I'm actually writing a movie.  It's about two cabbies that have a head-on collision and the explosion kills them both.  The movie is called Wouldn't Life Be Good If This Happens Every Eight Seconds.  Don't miss.  Jim Norton.  Hurry and get tickets right now.  And ticket master up at Jim Norton. 
[02:32:30]  The Yellow Discipline Tour.  I have an awful sense of humor.  That's funny.  The cabbie joke is great.  Thank you.  Every eight seconds.  Yeah, well, that's because they probably left it the way I naturally speak.  And it's short enough to do.  You know, I didn't call an escort service.  Thousand dollars.  That's not the way I talk.  I'm writing a movie cabbie, Chris.  Eight seconds.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Yeah.  That's great.  We'll have the right info.  We'll have tickets to give away to your show.  Wrong date.  Wrong venue.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  We'll take care of it.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  I'm done.  Do you want to give something away now?  If you want.  Yeah, we'll give away a couple pairs of tickets to see Jim Norton in Philly.  Jim Norton, Norton, Norton, Norton.  It's actually January 25th at TLA in Philly.  Yes.  All right.  Tickets go on sale this Friday.  But we got a few pairs for some Philly listeners.  Just sit on the edge.  And New York listeners.  They may want to take the road trip.  You only need the edge.  It was hilarious.  What do we learn next on the Opie and Anthony Show?  Pull your pants down.  Can I see your taint whipped cream lesbian?  Can we see your butt?  Let me tell you about my balloon nut. 
[02:33:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Radio's own slag.  Man, today flew, huh?  Just whizzed right by.  Once again, I want to acknowledge Buffalo.  Thank you, Buffalo.  The ratings trend in Buffalo was unbelievable today.  I mean, unbelievable.  We'll have more details, hopefully, in four weeks or so, I guess.  Yeah.  I guess it's time to play.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today?  Very educational. 
[02:34:00]  You know what Glenn the Tool learned?  Huh?  That you can actually go deaf from barfing.  Steve C. gained weight to ward off beautiful women.  And we all finally figured out what the C stands for in Steve C.  Steve C.  Right.  Sheep Lover.  I learned today when Norton hits the stage, Gary Glitter is playing as his intro music.  Well, they have something in common, at least.  Hard drive full of child porn.  Another one from Sheep Lover.  I learned today, how am I going to F Mel today? 
[02:34:30]  Ah.  Another one from Sheep Lover.  I learned today the pink flamingo is not a gay place.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned that the Asians like their Canada.  I learned I can't get a plug.  Shut up.  Oh, let's just stop the show.  Okay, that's cool.  Someone didn't get their attention today, yes?  Go ahead.  Well, you didn't buy us anything.  Go ahead.  Top-notch limousines, 516-756. 
[02:35:00]  Ow!  What?  What happened?  Go ahead.  Let them get it done so we can get back to our radio show.  Go ahead.  You can't, and she shut it off.  Get on.  Then shut it.  You have your on button right next to you.  I don't want to push it.  516-756-1663.  Tool.  Can we get back to our radio show now?  Yes, you can.  Thank you.  As I was saying, Anthony, I think this was the line of the day right here.  Danielle from Alabama writes,  I learned today banging Pam Anderson after Tommy Lee is like taking the stage after Richard Pryor. 
[02:35:30]  Rich from Philly, I learned today if Hopi blinks twice, it isn't rape.  And, uh, you know you get a lot of box if you forget a porn star.  Doug, what's going on, man?  I learned today the show ran better without Earl on it.  Uh, Earl was on for a split second right at the beginning.  Earl was on.  He was on for a split second.  How long did it take him to do that?  20 minutes?  This is Earl's number one fan, Doug from Springfield. 
[02:36:00]  Earl, obviously he has too much time on his hands.  What?  Really?  Did it take you all day to come up with that one?  At least I did something.  How are you feeling, Earl?  Earl, how are you feeling?  How's your new diet?  My new diet is great.  What'd you do with all those Cheetos and Grape Me High for breakfast?  Tough guy now over the phone, right?  Wait, wait, wait.  You're a tough guy over the phone, right?  Why do you just, because you call every radio show, because you obviously have no life.  Just, just blow me, okay?  Oh, wait, Earl. 
[02:36:30]  Earl, I choke on small bones.  They're in what return favors.  Earl, we're dumping out.  You can't say that.  You gotta watch.  Earl, that way you'll get some sex finally, right?  And I haven't vented that good in two weeks, and it felt great.  I heard the last patch you got was when you screeched your tires on your car.  You have no idea.  What?  You're sitting at home listening to a radio show, you loser.  What, you think you could beat my butt?  You're a tough guy, right?  This is your number one fan, Earl.  Earl, why do you hate me for? 
[02:37:00]  Anytime, anytime, anywhere.  Where?  I will kick your ass.  Yeah.  Oh.  Jesus.  Earl, he hung up.  You got to him that time.  Earl, he hung up.  Come on.  Oh.  Oh, my.  Earl, Earl, he's getting ready.  Earl, he's getting ready.  Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl.  Earl, don't let him fight. 
[02:37:30]  I don't have all day, Earl.  Come on.  I got to go.  No, no, no, no, no.  Ladies and gentlemen, this fight is scheduled for 12 rounds.  We set up Earl.  Doug was calling from the other studio, obviously.  No, no, no, Doug.  It's cool, man.  He just S'd himself.  Trust me.  Earl just S'd himself.  No, no, no.  Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, Earl, make a move, Earl.  Make a move.  Come on.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Where's your fire hose, Whitey?  That was good enough. 
[02:38:00]  Trust me.  We shall overcome.  Can't we all just get along?  Doug looks like a scary mofo.  Shake his hand.  There you go.  That was really good.  That was really good.  Oh, look at the lock.  That's good.  Doug from Springfield, live in the studio, burst in.  And Earl freaked out.  Earl, you shat yourself.  Shat?  You shat.  That's a word.  Yeah, it's a word.  Earl, I was scared for you.  That is a red-faced white boy and an angry white dude.  And Earl, I was behind you.  Does that for a hobby. 
[02:38:30]  And Earl turned like everyone else in the studio, white.  Earl, I was right behind you, brother.  I'm right there.  Yeah, sure you are.  Last time.  I'm excited about the concert.  Last time I saw anything that looked like that, it was that episode of The Little Rascals  when Stymie saw the spook.  The ears.  The ears went.  You can't eat that dog in here.  Get that dog out of here.  I don't know.  I'm over the way.  Hey, Earl, how freaked were you?  Come on.  Like a guy comes up behind, you just freak out.  You said any place, any time.  You didn't say that, Earl.  Yeah, you did.  Earl, you hooked me up.  He meant it.  Hey, Earl was starting to get ready. 
[02:39:00]  He was getting ready to rumble.  He was taking his watch out.  I saw Earl square off.  Earl squared off.  He was ready to rock.  All right.  Very good.  All right, guys.  Just let Earl throw punches on the water.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you, Earl.  There he is, dog.  That was good.  Good ending for the show today.  Yeah.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, I learned three things.  Yeah.  You can puke yourself deaf.  Yeah.  Hope he needs a rape whistle.  Yeah.  And your numbers always stink when you're sitting next to a rock star. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Norton rules, man.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, that's a blind day.  What's up, blind day?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Bye.  Have a good holiday, guys.  You too, man.  And finally, Dawn, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned today that Norton will be appearing this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.  All right.  That sounds different with a chick voice.  I know.  I don't know what it is.  Hey, Dawn, are you a teen girl?  Am I a what?  A teen.  No.  Sorry, I'm 27.  I'm just happy that a girl called our show.  I know. 
[02:40:00]  You see?  Woo!  See?  We put the word out for teen girls to go in the cat box.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I thought it was a teen I'd do it.  Oh, shut up.  Okay.  Be nice to the ladies.  We don't have any.  All right.  Thank you, Dawn.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  All right.  In honor of Earl, we got a couple more copies of Can You Dig It?  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.
