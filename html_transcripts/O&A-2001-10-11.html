<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with listener calls regarding show billboards and promotional stickers, followed by a discussion of Brian Regan's delayed flight and the New York Islanders.  A heated, highly aggressive and insulting phone call from a listener named “Bee,” enraged by the show’s treatment of a previous caller (“Patty”), ensued, involving both Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton. The conversation then abruptly shifted to a vomit-filled incident at the Don and Mike show, caused by a water-drinking contest, with callers detailing the puke-soaked studio and Eddie, the show's maintenance man, recounting his cleaning efforts and a previous bare-handed toilet unclogging incident (though he usually uses gloves).  The discussion then turned to the use of “Bunker Buster” bombs in Afghanistan, with callers offering their opinions on the war.  The show briefly revisited the Don and Mike vomit incident before promoting upcoming Philadelphia live shows, including a "Freak Box" (live sex booth), a fire-breathing twin act (one twin deemed “hotter”), a Stars and Stripes bikini contest, and guest appearances by Frank Caliendo and R. Lee Ermey.  Tenacious D's previous appearance was also mentioned.  The segment concluded with a conversation with Scorch (Gary Goldstein/Dave Anthony), discussing his career, his Jewish heritage (a surprise to the hosts), and his upcoming website, "Club Naked" (initially "Kingdom of Nakedness"), described in graphic detail.  Scorch's cousin, Michelle, also called in, adding to the vulgar humor.

Further calls included AJ, a fire-breather who described the sexually suggestive aspects of his act; Cody, discussing baseball; and several brief calls.  A significant portion focused on a phone conversation with R. Lee Ermey, covering his career, views on the war, his action figure, and his solution to airplane hijackings.  This segment included prank calls to O.J. Simpson and a 7-Eleven using *Full Metal Jacket* audio clips.  The hosts also played several clips of Buddy Epson’s “Well Doggies” routine, highlighting his cognitive decline. Frank Caliendo was present in the studio for parts of this segment.


Frank Caliendo, present in the studio, promoted his upcoming appearances at Bananas Comedy Clubs. He discussed his impressions, notably John Madden (including Madden’s reaction and a Jimmy Kimmel sketch involving eyebrow trimming), other impressions, potential projects (including a possible Madden sketch for Tom Arnold's show, which he seemed reluctant to do), and his frustration about not being listed on the MadTV website.  A call from Blind Dave detailed his successful, deceptive driver's license renewal while feigning blindness and injury.  Brian Regan called in, sick and unable to attend in person, describing his illness and its impact on his stand-up performances in a humorous way.  The show then tackled post-9/11 internet rumors and urban legends, including a naked-walking hoax email and the false story of a man riding down debris from the World Trade Center, featuring listener calls and discussions about skywriting and drug use. The segment ended with further promotion for Caliendo's shows and a taped Seinfeld impression, followed by a recounting of the hosts losing a radio award to a pop station DJ.


Further segments with Frank Caliendo in studio included jokes about George Steinbrenner's car theft and humorous anecdotes, with Caliendo performing numerous celebrity impressions (Aquaman, John Madden, Ted Knight).  A listener call backfired humorously. The hosts and guest discussed an email about Osama bin Laden's supposedly small penis and a supposed Bush administration plan to identify terrorists through mass public nudity.  The discussion included numerous comedic tangents and interruptions, promotion of Caliendo's shows, mentions of upcoming George Carlin shows and a WWF event, and ticket giveaways. The tone remained highly irreverent and frequently used offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027, anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Hello.  As everyone gets situated.  Got it. 
[00:01:00]  Tommy, what's going on?  Opie and Anthony, what's up, guys?  Hey, you tell us, bro.  Hey, I'm in Hyde Park right now in Boston, and I'm behind a bus, and the placards have  been replaced with just Opie and Anthony's WBCN.  It looks exactly like the Wild Ones did, but now it's just WBCN.  Oh.  Oh, and also, you know that they have billboards on the side of the highway that say AAF Rocks 
[00:01:30]  24-7?  Yeah.  Hey, what's Rocko?  That is big, you know.  I'll give you guys a call, and you know.  All right, great.  So what they've done is taken the wow off of the wow thing.  Yeah, they've taken the wow off.  All right, Tom, that's a great first call of the show.  Thank you.  Hey, you're welcome.  Did you go to the wow sticker stop in Boston yesterday?  I went to one last week in Braintree.  Yeah? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, one that went last, yesterday was up in Burlington, a little too far, I've not  going there for me.  Hey, Tom, we've got to face the fact this isn't going anywhere, all right?  What's that?  This phone call.  I knew it wouldn't.  I just figured I'd let you know.  No, we appreciate it.  We're going to have details.  We're coming up there soon, all right?  All right.  How's that?  How's that for a little tease?  That sounds pretty good.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  All right.  Christian, what's going on?  Hey, it's the O.P., Anthony, and Norton show. 
[00:02:30]  Norton's here, sure.  Yeah.  Just want to let you guys know, we're going to the Regan show tonight.  Brian Regan.  We're in Medford?  He's in Medford.  At the Governor's of Medford, we highly recommend you go see Brian Regan.  We've got about 10 of us going.  It's going to be awesome.  We're all in.  We might have some bad news about Regan.  He's not coming in today, Rick.  What?  His flight's late.  What?  Yeah, something screwed up on their end.  It's not anthrax, isn't it?  He might have to phone it in, if anything.  No, it's not anthrax. 
[00:03:00]  He might give us a call.  We're kind of bummed because we're looking forward to seeing him today.  And I know a lot of people are listening to hear Brian Regan, but he might not make it in.  Maybe he'll make it tomorrow, though.  Yeah, he might.  All right.  We do have Frank Caliendo coming in.  Thank you, Christian.  So he can do his Regan impression.  We'll get that.  Diesel, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  The O&A Show.  Hey.  Just calling up, just letting you guys know that your Islanders are going down tonight. 
[00:03:30]  I'm getting on the parkway right now, going to catch the game at the middle end.  Dude, we're 3-0.  Relax.  Oh, bro, come on.  You're going to be 3-1 after tonight.  We're going to see you guys for dinner.  We're going to still make the playoffs.  Yeah, well, you know, it's been a long time since you guys have done that.  We've been to the big dance for the last two years.  Big dance.  All right, Diesel, thank you.  Another cliche you can throw in there.  The big dance.  You know what we've got to get out of the way is the bee call.  Where's the bee call? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, when bee called in.  She had a problem.  What'd she have a problem with?  She had a stick firmly wedged.  Oh, it was the way Patty was being treated.  The hysterical Patty who wet herself because Oprah yelled at her.  And then bee called up to defend Patty, I guess.  Yeah.  And Norton was very cordial to her on the phone.  Here it is.  Bee, what's up?  Hey, listen, Patty? 
[00:04:30]  What?  Are you there?  Yes, I am.  Do me a favor from one self-respecting woman to another woman.  Give Opie the finger, stand up, turn around, and never give him the time of day again.  He's making an ass out of you.  He's making an ass out of the whole radio station.  No, he's just angry because I made a mistake.  Bee, bee, bee, bee.  Oh, God, listen to battered woman syndrome.  No, no, no, no.  Big, spewing out.  He's just angry because I made a mistake.  I walked into a door. 
[00:05:00]  He chained her to the radiator, too.  No.  And when you're angry, you express tight.  How long have you been listening to the show?  I started listening when you guys started talking about, you know, Bin Laden because I thought  you were doing it very well.  Ah.  And the last few times, like with Andrew Dice Clay, I hate that man.  And the way you guys treated him, I was like, he was apologizing to Jay Moore and the jackass  was like, well, I just can't find it within my heart.  I've been getting so pissed off at you guys.  You've been using your radio show. 
[00:05:30]  You don't be used to up yourself.  Shut up, stupid.  Don't listen anymore.  God almighty, put on the C-Network and listen to that.  Well, you know, I turned that way because guess what?  We're blowing up Afghanistan.  That's right.  So tie that in with a stalker Patty comment, you dummy.  We're blowing up country.  Shut up, stupid.  Go back to Mayberry and get stomach cancer.  You stink.  Oh, God damn.  I'm the.  Just tell it one self-respecting woman who listens to a show she doesn't like.  Die. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, good.  While we're blowing up people.  While we're blowing up people.  Don't try to be emotionally manipulative.  You dullard.  This is a comedy show.  Shut up.  Don't try to make a poignant statement, you ass.  Oh, yeah.  You wouldn't understand it, you idiot.  I wouldn't understand.  Just keep filleting your husband until he works and pays the bills.  You contribute nothing to that household.  Shut up.  I probably make more than both of you put together.  And so what?  Good for him.  He has to deal with you.  He deserves all the money he can make.  She has to tolerate your self-righteous nonsense. 
[00:06:30]  I really don't like her.  Am I talking to Snortin' Norton?  Yes, you are.  That was very clever of you.  Okay.  B.  Waka waka.  So pick another radio station.  Try the veal.  Shut up.  B.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm going to hang up.  Daddy, get up and leave.  I'm not hanging up.  You're really self-respecting.  I'm not hanging up.  I'm just going to get yelled at.  Wow, you have a lot of self-esteem.  That's really good.  I'm trying to save another woman who's in distress over there.  Oh, you stop with your rescue mission.  Taking advantage of the mentally ill.  That's cool.  And look who we're talking to. 
[00:07:00]  Shut your yap.  Hey, B.  Okay, Snortin' Norton.  Snortin' Norton.  Snortin' Snortin'?  I can do a Neil Diamond impression or something.  You talk like foghorn leghorn.  Shut up.  People enjoy the Neil Diamond impression.  Oh, yeah.  We really.  And we just like the O.J. Simpson thing.  Oh, yeah.  People love O.J.  You guys did a really good job before.  I was very impressed.  And now you're not.  So turn it off and listen to something else.  What the hell are they doing?  You stink.  We let our soft side poke out briefly.  We're back to doing our radio show.  Yeah, B. 
[00:07:30]  If you don't like it, then find another show.  Goodbye, B.  I probably won't be listening anymore, but I just hope Patty is okay.  Hang on.  Don't punch your kids.  Shut up.  I mean, I understand.  B, let me tell you something.  He's mental.  Get her some help.  Do you honestly think that I think that everyone is a girl?  Are you agreeing with me today?  I look like the biggest dick today.  I know that.  But this is how I feel, and I can't help it.  You know, I understand your position, but maybe you should give her some help.  The phones want to kill me.  And B, stop trying to take care of everyone.  I'm not trying to impress the listeners by saying the right thing. 
[00:08:00]  I am saying what I'm feeling in my heart, okay?  I've had enough mental patients involved with my freaking life.  I've had it.  Can I talk?  I've had it.  Patty, you shouldn't be there anymore.  Just get up and go.  What is the matter with you?  B's a C.  Go away, Patty.  Get up and go.  Don't talk to him anymore.  Why don't you go out and help some homeless people?  Stop trying to rescue everyone and make up for your own inadequacies, you dope.  Leave her alone.  She wants to leave.  She'll leave.  She doesn't need you, the strong woman calling. 
[00:08:30]  Get up and go, sister.  Shut it.  B likes a D in her A.  She really did.  And a little HIV on her face.  Or snorting Norton or whoever the hell you are.  Well, I'm snorting Norton, you know.  Elbow yourself.  I got her good, didn't I, girlfriend?  You sure did.  High five, high five.  The guy's name is Jim Norton.  Where did you get snorting Norton from?  Snorting Norton is the morning guy at 97 Rock in Buffalo, which is an embarrassing show.  Hey, B, shut up.  Okay?  Shut it.  You obviously don't know the history between Patty and the show.  You're very new to the show. 
[00:09:00]  I understand that.  So maybe you don't have all the facts in front of you.  Okay.  I'm just feeling...  Okay.  Hang up.  How's this?  How's this?  Hang up.  I feel bad for you.  I feel bad for her.  Hang up.  Who don't you feel bad for in the world?  Stop it already.  Stop it.  You know, Kathy, compassion.  I feel bad for your husband.  Well, a big heart and probably your big hips, too.  Shut up.  Oh, hell no.  I'm quite thin.  Oh, really?  Nice.  You're not a Buffalo Betty, then?  No, not a Buffalo Betty.  Do you have a nice rack, if I could ask, in the middle of this argument?  No.  Patty. 
[00:09:30]  No, I don't have that in the middle.  What does Patty want to say?  I want to talk.  All right.  She's got a statement to make.  Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.  I'm sorry I made an error in judgment.  Oh, crying out loud, Patty.  There's no helping you.  Just gee it up.  This B sure is right.  Isn't she right?  I'm trying to apologize, because people misunderstand me a lot.  B, can you hang up?  Yeah.  We loved you in Fargo.  Goodbye.  B, hang up, all right?  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  I thought you said you weren't hanging up.  B, you're a liar. 
[00:10:00]  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That thing's hilarious.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oi.  A lot of people wondering what the hell happened during the first break, but I had to run out  of here and puke.  What the hell is going on? 
[00:10:30]  Smells like puke in the studio.  Smells like puke outside near the foosball table.  The toilet is jammed.  You can't even take a leak, because it really smells bad in there.  It's covered with puke.  Who the hell is puking all over the place?  There's some, I think there's somebody right now cleaning the bathroom, or trying to, but  vomit just kind of fills the air.  There's no way to just get rid of it.  Who is vomiting?  Who is puking?  Anyone?  Can anyone shed light on why the whole outside smells like vomit? 
[00:11:00]  All I know is it's pretty bad, because Eddie will clean anything.  He ain't clean.  And he ain't clean.  I'm not cleaning that.  Call the building.  What's the story, though?  Why is there puke everywhere?  Anyone have an eye?  Anyone outside the studio?  We should know why there's puke.  Maybe someone listening to the radio knows.  No one around here knows.  The Don and Mike show.  What happened?  We had a contest.  A contest.  See who could drink the most water and hold the urine. 
[00:11:30]  Okay.  And somebody, I guess, they hold the urine.  They had a what?  And they hold it in their stomach.  Don and Mike had a water drinking contest?  See who could drink a liter.  Call the trays.  A liter every ten minutes.  What?  I thought we were all just having fun.  What happened?  No, so what?  They had a water drinking contest, and then someone puked.  Yep.  A couple of them. 
[00:12:00]  A couple, like six.  There was six guys.  I think five of them puked all over the place.  Did they have a bucket set up where the people could puke?  The garbage can.  There was nothing where somebody could puke into.  Earl wants to explain.  It absolutely stinks in here.  Earl, what's up?  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  He fell asleep on the phone.  Earl.  Very tired from waking up. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, my God.  Mark, what's going on?  Yeah, you already answered it.  It was Don and Mike.  They had a water drinking contest a couple hours ago, I guess,  because they were still drunk from last night's bowling thing.  So they were just drinking water, and then they puked up all over the place.  Well, wait, they had too much fun last night bowling, so they had to drink water today.  Yeah, they just had a water drinking contest who could drink the most water or whatever,  and then...  Who's vomit is this?  Yeah, just like Don and them.  Well, why can't they clean up their puke? 
[00:13:00]  Beats me.  Or have something to contain the puke so it's not all over.  We've had things happen in this studio where people have vomited.  Well, you had that milk contest.  We make sure that there's garbage pails full with plastic bags and tarps on the floor.  I don't know.  All right.  I don't need this all day.  Thank you, Mark.  All right.  See you, man.  To the bathroom and smelling that and getting erections.  You are disturbed.  Hey, Earl, what's up?  You know, they basically covered it down in like they had a water drinking contest, 
[00:13:30]  and guys were puking everywhere.  And that's why I'm staying away from the studio, because I'll puke.  I hate the smell of puke.  Sounds like who loves it.  Sounds like fun and wacky radio, but could they clean up their puke?  Hey, I just need to put it together.  We have to use that bathroom, man.  I know.  I mean, I have avoided that studio at all costs.  Sure was a hooch, but come on.  Clean up your puke. 
[00:14:00]  Now we have to go to Washington and puke all over the JFK studios.  Dan, what's going on?  Yeah, I am part of the culprit.  You puke?  Well, yeah, but in a garbage can.  I'll explain what happened.  Dan and Mike, for money, it was called like hold it or whatever,  so we had to pound liters of water every 10 minutes.  And the urine production is exceeded by the capacity of your stomach. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  So we couldn't, we were just, you know, we're pounding water, pounding water, pounding water.  And no one took a leak.  But eventually, you just reached capacity.  Right.  And, yeah, some big heavy kid puked all over the bathroom, all over the place.  It was a mess.  Figures, big fat kid.  So who puked so bad that the toilet is clogged and the whole place stinks?  Well, I think these two guys pounded two liters of water, which really isn't that much.  Guy puked all over his shoes, all over the bathroom.  I didn't go in the bathroom.  Thankfully, I was, unfortunately, I came in second place, but I went right into the garbage can. 
[00:15:00]  I thought it was the microphone, but it turns out it wasn't this time.  No, it was a can.  But they made the last guy pull out the garbage can.  All right.  But it was all contained to the bathroom in the can, so.  I'm smelling.  And I guess I'm smelling Lysol now.  Yeah, all that for 50 bucks, you know.  Now it smells like puke with Lysol mixed in.  Well, good luck cleaning up, fellas.  So no one from their show felt like they should clean up the mess before they got out of here? 
[00:15:30]  Dan?  Hello?  Anyone?  I guess not.  Sounds like some gripping radio today.  Mm-hmm.  Big Chris, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Norton.  Hi, Chris.  I think it's time for the major announcement.  I think today's the day we make the major announcement.  The hiv?  No, I think I know what it's going to be, but I'll be hinted to it the other day. 
[00:16:00]  I'm going to let him say it.  We have no goddamn announcement today.  Jim Norton, permanent member.  No.  There's no announcement today?  Jim Norton.  Bye-bye.  Huh?  So what are they doing to the toilet?  Are they now cleaning it?  I know we're spending too much time on the puke, but you guys don't understand how bad it smells in here.  At least now it's a lemony, fresh Lysol smell.  Awful Lysol.  Terrible.  It's better than the puke.  It is better than puke.  It's not much.  It's not my grandmother's bathroom. 
[00:16:30]  It used to smell like this.  Dude, I almost hurled when I came.  We beat the crap out of that bathroom on a daily basis.  We need to get in there.  Well, dude, when Eddie comes in, and Eddie will clean up, like I've seen Eddie clean up anything.  Get livin' la, livin' la.  He's actually, at one point, the toilet was clogged.  He stuck his fist right down the toilet and pulled out whatever was clogging it.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a trooper.  Doug, what's going on?  What's going on?  On a scale of one to ten, what is the puke?  A five?  A six?  Does it smell like Limburger cheese and provolone?  You can smell the puke in the studio. 
[00:17:00]  It's an eight or a nine.  You leave the studio.  But the consistency, does it look like oatmeal, or does it look like runny oatmeal?  Stop it.  This guy's great.  It looks like wallpaper glow.  Hey, Norton, I've got to ask you one question from yesterday.  Okay.  With the bathroom attendant, if he gives you a shopping bag, do you give him extra money?  The shopping bag.  Nice ball bag from like six months ago.  You need the shopping bag if you're going to put little boys in there.  And you're all cleaning up the puke?  We've got Living La, Living La in the studio.  Eddie.  Eddie.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Eddie. 
[00:17:30]  What's up?  Eddie, what's the status of the bathroom?  It stinks.  It stinks.  Now, is there puke all over the place?  Everywhere.  Even in the bowl.  In the bowl?  Like on the wall?  It's all over the floor.  Not on the wall, but in the balls itself.  And it's all over the floor.  It's on the rim of the bowl.  When you lift up the one seat.  Yeah.  Is it true you put your whole hand in there?  No, I did not.  I heard once that the toilet was clogged, Eddie.  You went in and actually put your hand down the toilet and grabbed the big clog of toilet  paper and whatever was in it and pulled it out barehanded. 
[00:18:00]  No, I wear gloves when I do that.  Was he wearing gloves when he did that?  I don't know of any gloves that wouldn't be full of water when you thrust your arm down  at the clogged toilet.  Were you trying to clean a toilet on that American Airlines flight the other day?  No, I was not.  Eddie, so is it your job to clean the bathroom?  Well, I feel bad you have to clean up after Don and Mike.  So do I.  It's like, that's why I had the building come and do it all.  But it's like, I ain't doing this.  Well, they didn't do a good job because it's still clogged. 
[00:18:30]  Well, they're coming back to do it.  Eddie!  All right, Eddie.  Yeah.  Well, thanks for helping us out, all right?  You're welcome, Mo.  And Ed?  All right.  Bye, Eddie.  Bye.  There he goes.  He's our maintenance guy.  You know, he'll clean up.  Maybe he'll deliver a little mail for us every so often.  All right.  So there's the big distraction.  Smells like puke everywhere.  Dan, what's up?  O&A.  How are you guys with the Bunker Busters?  Oh, I love the Bunker Busters.  The Bunker Buster Bombs.  Yeah, the first few days of the S-Track, we've been bombing stuff. 
[00:19:00]  It's been pretty cool.  But now, apparently, last night, they really laid waste to a lot of these bunkers that some of the military is.  They called it a bombing that would degrade the morale of the Taliban soldiers.  So they got these bombs.  Get this.  The actual casing of the bomb is made out of surplus 8-inch gun barrels, like from ships and tanks and whatnot. 
[00:19:30]  They're gun barrels.  That's the case that they pack with explosives.  These things can borrow in, like, between 20 and 50 feet underground before they explode.  So they're all having their party in the bunker.  Hey, this is lots of fun.  The roof caves in.  This thing comes in to say hi and blows up with 5,000 pounds of explosives, which has been laying waste to a lot of their bunkers and stuff.  So I'm all for it.  I love the Bunker Busters.  Yeah, but your information's a little wrong.  It's not designed to do that.  It's designed to get their underwear dirty. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, right.  Well, no, the people that it's around, they will be killed.  The people that hear it, yeah, their underwear gets dirty real quick.  You've got to think Bin Laden knows that we've got these Bunker Busters and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's not a cave safe now for him.  Well, you know, they all talk about how brave they are and how they're going to defeat everybody.  Meanwhile, I hear that Bin Laden's being changed from location to location,  and they're using ambulance to transport him around so he doesn't get hurt.  Meanwhile, ambulance could probably be used for wounded and whatnot. 
[00:20:30]  But, no, Osama needs that to make sure he's kept hidden.  I'm sure if he had a baby to hold in front of him, they'd do that, too.  I'm sure he would, bastards.  They're all a bunch of hypocrites.  All right, guys, I want to hear myself on the radio.  All right, Dan, thank you.  John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, tell Eddie he left his little hockey helmet in the back of the bus.  All right, let me tell you something about Eddie.  There's a rule on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We do not make fun of Eddie.  Dan, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:21:00]  Norton.  I didn't make fun of Eddie.  Norton didn't know, though.  Norton made fun of Eddie.  I didn't make fun of Eddie.  Eddie is the only one in the building we don't make fun of.  All right.  We're trying not to.  I know it's easy, and sometimes things slip.  Is touching him allowed to know?  No, no, no, no, you can't be touching either.  You know, they also had a couple of instances.  It was great in L.A. Law, by the way.  Oh, jeez.  Well, you don't know what role he played, so see, that's okay.  I don't think it was the head of the company.  All right. 
[00:21:30]  This happened, too.  Airline jitters, of course, everybody flying, getting a little scared.  It seems one guy handed a note to a flight attendant that was deemed threatening.  Jesus, I swear to God, can you spray the Lysol some more?  I don't mean to interrupt you, Anthony.  That's good.  You get a little too much.  It does smell like vomit in here.  Stop.  Go ahead.  Yeah, he gives a note to a flight attendant that they deemed, it could have been interpreted  as threatening. 
[00:22:00]  Like, whore, get me another drink or something.  But it could have been interpreted as threatening.  But this guy, Yasin Yasser, his name is.  This is another guy.  He holds a plastic knife that came with his food to his throat.  His own throat, yeah.  He kind of makes a little motion with it and smiles at a flight attendant.  Maybe if your name is Yasin Yasser, you should sit your ass down, shut up, and do nothing  on your flight.  Where's he from, Anthony?  Does it say where he's from? 
[00:22:30]  He is a Pakistani.  Really?  Yeah.  Shocking.  Of Pakistani descent.  And he said he was joking.  That's a great joke.  Come on, Norton.  You're a comic.  That's a great joke.  I definitely, I definitely, you see, the point is, if your name is Yasin Yasser, not  only should you, you shouldn't sit there and be quiet because you shouldn't be on the  plane to begin with.  Thank you.  I feel the same way.  We appreciate you guys stopping into the country.  Bye-bye.  All of them.  Round them out.  They hate us, and I want them out. 
[00:23:00]  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  What's up, man?  Listen, I'm kind of keeping up with all this stuff, but this is kind of like Planet  of the Apes against Top Gun.  You know, with all the bombing that we're doing, I mean, they've got people over there  saying, jumping on donkey-drawn carts and taking off.  Yeah, the refugees in carts, wagons, pulled by donkeys.  Pulled by donkeys.  You know, it's like key shooters trying to shoot down F-14s.  Yeah.  It ain't gonna happen.  They can't shoot down our planes.  We fly now all day, all night, and just bomb their country into craters.  Exactly. 
[00:23:30]  And they're wondering, like, gee, maybe we pissed them off a little bit, you know?  Well, that's just it.  And they're now crying that they need rallying from the rest of the Muslim countries.  Yeah.  But they're not coming to their aid.  No, how about?  That's it.  It's not like years ago when the Soviet Union went to Afghanistan and it was a big problem  and everyone was saying, hey, United States gets in there.  It's gonna be ugly because, you know, the Soviet Union tried.  Yeah, we were giving weapons and support to the opposition.  We were backing them up.  Now they're completely cut off.  And it's just a matter of time before I sincerely believe they will get Osama bin Laden. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  I really think they will.  Now, did you hear today that supposedly somebody from Saudi Arabia was going to donate like  $10 million for the relief fund?  Yes.  But then they were knocking the American policy and then Giuliani said, you know, take the  money and, you know, keep it.  We don't want it.  Yeah.  And then I hear the Afghani refugees are burning.  They're piling up and burning our relief food that we've been dropping.  Really?  To feed them.  Good.  Starve, you animals.  Winter's coming.  Winter's coming.  Go eat some snowballs now.  Eat each other.  Was it the Taliban that was burning it or the actual refugees?  The Taliban said that some of the refugees were piling it up and burning it. 
[00:24:30]  I don't believe that.  No.  But I'm sure if the Taliban finds it, they will probably eat them themselves.  Yeah.  We'll be feeding the troops that we bomb.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Peace.  Let's go to Josh from San Francisco.  Josh, what's going on?  Yeah.  Hi.  This is Josh out in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Yeah.  And I know you guys make fun of KYCY, but I got to tell you, I'm 50 miles away.  I hear you loud and clear.  I think it's a great station.  I'm from Philly, New York. 
[00:25:00]  Been out here 25 years and I'm a big fan.  Oh, good.  No, we don't really know much about KYCY.  We were joking because one of our pals, West Coast Dave, he's not that far from the station  and he can't get the station in.  He can't get it.  He says there are obstacles in the way.  It might be because of the tall buildings or the hills, but I tell you, you can get it  up near Sacramento.  You can get it down in Santa Clara.  Right.  And you come in loud and clear and you have a lot of fans out here.  All right.  Cool.  I'm glad to hear that.  Thank you.  Great talking to you.  All right, bro.  Did they finish the bathroom? 
[00:25:30]  Is it done?  Tim, what's up?  Hey, Owen, what's happening?  Hey, man.  Hey, I was just wondering, did they throw like that cornmeal slash kitty litter mixture that  they used to use in elementary school?  In school when someone pukes in school.  It's like an oil.  Like when you spill oil in your garage.  I mean, you just throw that crap on it.  It's like elementary school.  There's that one guy that would just come running in with it and just drop it.  Wasn't it called zinc something?  No.  Tim, I'm glad you brought that up, though, because, yeah, it's bringing us back to elementary  school.  It smells like that type of puke in here.  Oh, man. 
[00:26:00]  Remember the girls would puke in their desks and they would just stink all day.  You're like, come on.  The worst was when somebody would puke in the cafeteria.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, the whole cafeteria would just get hot and smelly with puke.  Oh, it'll work.  And you couldn't eat your lunch.  And the poor janitor would come in and throw that stuff down.  Yeah.  Well, then there was a kid in the classroom.  Yeah.  The girl would be sick and the teacher would say, put your head on your desk.  Yeah.  How about put your head in the toilet bowl?  Because then she'd just...  Exactly the worst.  Just stink the whole classroom up. 
[00:26:30]  Hey, I'm from D.C.  You guys are awesome.  Norton, you rule.  See ya.  All right, Tim.  Thanks.  Do we have some good news, John?  Yes.  The bathroom is done.  The floor is completely redone.  And the toilet's all cleaned out.  This bathroom is clean.  Yes, exactly.  It's ready to go.  Smells great.  Smells great.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  Now if we can only deodorize the outside area so we're not puking, playing foosball.  It's awful. 
[00:27:00]  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, Owen A.  What up?  Hey, bro.  I heard that commercial.  Is that a prediction that the Devils are going down?  Yeah, the Devils are going to lose tonight.  Sure.  Ah, we're going to say.  And, uh, yo, Norton.  Yes.  Do a shot of anthrax and give me the Hucklebuck.  Hucklebuck.  Nice reference.  Bye, Hitachi Power Tools.  Later, guys.  All right, Mike.  You going to the show next week?  Later.  He's just listening to himself.  Ah, we're less than a week away.  Do the Hucklebuck. 
[00:27:30]  What's that from?  Do the Hucklebuck.  Uh, Honeymooners.  It is the Honeymooners.  Okay.  Ah, we got our 100th show in syndication for Philadelphia happening Wednesday.  A week from yesterday, Days of Newer is going to help us out.  Octane, a nice cover band.  Stephen Lynch is going to do some time on the stage.  Jim Norton's going to do some time.  Rich Voss is coming down.  Uh-oh.  Very nice.  That's like the sherbet to clean the palate.  He's going to get things going.  He's like the salad.  Is he the salad?  He's the salad.  I'm the salad.  Voss is a...  He's a disgusting man. 
[00:28:00]  Voss will be able to handle that car, though.  He's going to do fine.  I owe my kid money.  I'm dodging her.  We also have the freak box.  Freak box is coming down?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Want to explain the freak box to Philly?  Uh, freak box.  It's, uh...  I don't know.  What is it like a...  It's a box.  It's like a...  It's like a small, tiny room.  It's bigger than a Port-O-Sand portable toilet.  Right.  And you can have, like, a chick in there with you.  Yeah, and anything goes in there.  You go in. 
[00:28:30]  It's a video camera that takes pictures they put on the web.  And everything has happened from people that feel the need to put things in certain places in their body.  And, uh, guy-girl action.  Uh, girl-girl action.  Unfortunately, there's been guy-guy action.  And while it's going down in the box, there's monitors outside the box so the whole bar can check it out.  Or the whole electric factory.  Yeah.  So that's a lot of fun.  We got the fire-breathing twin chicks hitting the stage.  Yeah, what's their story?  They're twin girls.  Well, there's a guy, and, uh, he kind of runs it, but he's got these twin chicks. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  That can, uh, do the same thing.  And what do they do?  They breathe fire?  They do some other weird stuff, too.  He was trying to explain to me.  I'm like, dude, save it.  Are they hot?  Because that's good.  He said one of them was pretty hot.  Uh-oh.  One?  The other one having an accident?  Yeah.  They're practicing?  How do you get only one hot twin?  She's the one that breathes fire into the other girl's face.  So she's the hot one.  No?  Um, he really didn't explain it. 
[00:29:30]  Could we talk to him on the air?  Now I'm curious why only one twin is hot.  And why he's saying that.  He could just say, yeah, they're both gorgeous.  Twins could either be really ugly or really hot.  Yeah.  I guess they're not identical.  You don't get one.  Probably not.  Yeah, we might have to do a twin contest eventually.  If you have a really ugly twin and you're hot.  Are you hot and is your twin a breech baby?  That's impossible, though.  I've never heard of that before.  On Fox Family before the show today.  With the Olsen twins. 
[00:30:00]  It was one of their latest, like, shows or something.  And they were dressing up like the bad girls in school or something.  These little skirts and shorts and little tops.  Little fake tattoos.  Yeah, those are hot twins right there.  Yeah, it's hot.  Cut off shirts.  If I can dare say, those two are getting pretty hot.  Have been for quite a while.  Without having been quoted in Time Magazine.  All right.  And finally, when we go to Philly to the Electric Factory this coming Wednesday, the 17th, week from yesterday,  we're going to do the Stars and Stripes Bikini Contest. 
[00:30:30]  Some lucky lady is walking home with $1,000 cash.  Yeah.  So, ladies, get your bikini outfits together.  It has to have a patriotic theme.  Right.  If you don't have a bathing suit, we will be providing bikinis.  Stars and Stripes bikinis.  So, don't worry about that.  We'll be on the stage and we'll announce, you know, for the ladies to head to a certain area of the Electric Factory to sign up for that contest.  That's going to be the showstopper, okay?  Can a girl with a big 70s Earth Mama Muff just cut out the top part of Osama Bin Laden's face and put it over her area? 
[00:31:00]  That would be a cool bikini.  It would be part of the theme.  Sure.  Not wash it for six months.  Not wash it, right.  Just let it stink like he does.  I like a nice, tight, snug, shall we say, a thorn bikini bottom, a good at hugging, nice snug.  You like that?  Something snug?  Yeah.  Something that isn't wedgie-like?  Oh, no, I like it.  A good camel toe.  You like a wedge?  Yeah.  Camel toe?  Yeah, I love it.  Love it.  Yeah.  Like that?  Really?  Yeah.  Well, girls, if Norton's going to be judging part of you, you might take that into consideration. 
[00:31:30]  Boy, are they swollen.  You like the ones that are just plump?  You like them plump?  You don't know.  I like it to look like two severed thighs.  You like that?  Yeah.  How about, like, you take two hot dogs, two plump hot dogs, put them next to each other  and slightly bend them?  Yeah.  You like it like that?  Yeah, with a big, fat hat in the middle.  Okay.  I like that.  All right.  Like a catcher's mitt.  Yeah.  I like that. 
[00:32:00]  I'm with you on that.  Bam.  Hi.  Hey, as we go to break here, Tenacious D was in the studio yesterday.  We had a lot of fun with them, and we want to play one of their songs from their latest  CD.  This is F Her Gently.  Playing tonight in Philly.  Yes, they are.  They're playing tonight at the Electric Factory.  Tenacious D.  This is a song.  1027.  WNEW. 
[00:32:30]  A taste of P.O.D.  Alive.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Boy.  Coming in today at 4.30, Frank Caliendo, a very funny guy.  He's on MADtv.  He's a good friend of the show.  Yes.  Great with the impressions.  Does Al Pacino and John Madden and...  And, uh...  Ted Knight.  Brian Regan.  Brian Regan.  Since we don't have Regan today.  Adam Sandler.  He did a great Robin Williams on a MADtv show about two weeks ago. 
[00:33:00]  Also, Sergeant Hartman calling in at 4.30.  Yes.  Nice.  I have a feeling he doesn't want to talk about Full Metal Jacket, though.  Really?  I don't know.  I would hope so.  Let's just talk about Dead Man Walking and Mississippi Burning.  He's got a...  He's got an action figure out.  A big one-foot G.I. Joe-sized doll that talks.  It curses at you.  It's a cursing doll.  It really curses?  Yeah.  You get your head out of your A-hole and, uh...  It says the S-word. 
[00:33:30]  Not for the kids.  No, it's not for the kids.  Not for the kids.  That type of language.  Oh, we've got to back up a little bit.  The, uh...  100th show coming to Philly very soon.  And we're doing the Fire Breathing Twin Chick Act.  AJ.  Yo, ONA.  You're responsible for the, uh...  The Fire Breathing Twins?  Yeah.  They're...  They Fire Breathing with me.  I'm on stage as well.  All right.  Now, uh...  Rick was, uh...  Talking to you off the air.  And, uh...  You told him that one of the twins is cute and the other is so-so?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not going to sit there and say... 
[00:34:00]  I'm not going to sit there and say the other ones as hot as the other one.  And, uh...  They're fraternal twins.  So, one's got a couple of pounds on her.  But she looks pretty good in the corset.  So, one got hit with the ugly stick and the other one's pretty good looking?  Yeah, basically.  How does that happen?  It's not like the movie Twins.  Yeah, but it's a movie.  That's not real life.  That's true.  Shane DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  DeVito turned out to get the junkie DNA and Arnold got all the good ones.  Yeah, but I'm making up for it.  We've got...  I've got one professional mistress with a hell of a rack who's going to be on stage. 
[00:34:30]  And she's going to be dancing with fire as well.  What are we going to see at the electric factory on the 17th?  You're going to see grinding, which is...  Grinding, always good.  Grinding.  You're going to see pyrotechnics.  Uh-huh.  Fire, always good.  Fire is always good.  You're going to see a lot of flamethrowing and fire breathing.  You're going to see...  Are they going to be topless, AJ?  I might be...  Actually, believe it or not, I might be able to talk them into that.  Can we get away with it down there?  We'll see. 
[00:35:00]  We've got to work with the electric factory.  We'll figure it out when we get down there.  If we can get away with it...  Don't want to break any laws.  No.  That's not us.  We don't do that.  Yeah, I think...  We're law-abiding DJs.  Yeah, well, I didn't see a thing.  Well, I'm going to look, though.  So one's fat and one's hot.  One's fat, one's hot.  But the other girls that I'm going to have on stage are definitely hot.  What about the mistress?  Is she a professional mistress?  Like, she does, like, real domination stuff?  Yes, she does.  Is she attractive?  Yes, she is.  Black girl.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[00:35:30]  Do it with that language.  Whoops, sorry.  Love that word, but they don't allow that through, unfortunately.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, humongous ta-tas.  Is the difference between these two sisters, like, the difference in the sisters in heart,  the Wilson sisters?  Yeah.  You got, like, that one hot one and then a big, who's that, tugboat Annie and Wilson?  They're both sweethearts, so I got to give them that.  I got to give them that.  Yeah.  Sweet.  How long is this awful act going to last?  Trust me, it's not an awful act. 
[00:36:00]  I'll tell you what, if you can sit there and look at this act and not go.  I think I'd rather do some midnight bowling.  I'm very surprised, but it's only going to go about it.  Why is everyone leaving me, man?  Hey, where did A.J. go?  Where did A.J. go?  He wasn't insulted, was he?  Oh, now you might have reened it.  Could you get A.J. back in line?  I think you reened it.  Philly still doesn't understand the sarcasm fully yet.  Oh.  Did we just lose the fire-breathing twin chick act? 
[00:36:30]  I hope not.  A.J., if you're still listening, call back, all right?  Our buddy Scorch is checking in.  Scorch is.  Scorch is a radio personality that is stuck in the middle of nowhere doing a horrible morning show.  Oh, my God, no.  I'm one of the many K-Rocks that are scattered around the country.  That plague the nation.  And my show happens to be one of the most horrible ones, so thank you very much.  I wonder what station was the first K-Rock.  Yeah.  Oh, I have no idea.  Probably L.A. 
[00:37:00]  Another invention by program directors that just have no ideas left in their brain.  That's pretty funny.  Hey, there's K-Rock stations all over the country.  Why don't we just name ours K-Rock as well?  Well, in L.A., you know.  That would be my programming department.  It's the K, because the K starts the radio stations out there like the W's do on the East Coast.  So they had the K-Rock out there.  That works.  But how do you get one on the East Coast?  You want to hear a really good story? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  The K-Rock in New York.  Yeah.  When they started up here in New York, there's a K-Rock that's really famous in L.A.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  So they decided to make this really horrible station at the time a K-Rock in New York.  No one was listening to the station, so they changed their format, and they called themselves K-Rock.  But then what they did, because they were affiliated with the one in L.A., they got all their station promos of all these great rock stars like Anthony Kiedis and Kurt Cobain, all of them, saying, 
[00:38:00]  Hey, man, you're listening to the greatest rock station on the planet, K-Rock.  And no one heard of K-Rock in New York yet.  Meanwhile, yeah, they got it from L.A.  They got it from the K-Rock in L.A.  They couldn't play them because they had been a classic rock station.  Right.  So then all these new artists, they needed some of these promos for their station, so they just went out to the K-Rock in L.A. and stole theirs.  That's great.  They stole theirs, and then it was so funny.  The station's barely on the air. 
[00:38:30]  It's like, Hey, it's Anthony Kiedis.  When I'm in New York, I listen to K-Rock, the greatest station.  I'm like, the station's been on for two days.  Yeah, and then there's a different voice that tells you the frequency because it's different than the one out in L.A.  Premonition.  So what is the Syracuse K-Rock up to these days?  Syracuse K-Rock, actually, the best of Syracuse came out yesterday.  We won the best of Syracuse.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You don't just glaze that over.  That seems like... 
[00:39:00]  That's huge news, man.  You don't have an act to go, yeah, and then I won an Oscar, and then you go on.  You won.  I was going to jump the station and go on to my own little award.  Scorch, were you voted best DJ in Syracuse?  You know, I missed it, though I, by one vote.  Here's a really sad story.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  There are two people on their show.  Hold on.  There goes my dog.  Hold on.  I got him pissed off.  Hold on.  Let's slow down a little bit.  Now, who won best DJ in Syracuse, Scorch?  This guy named Dakota at this disco station.  Dakota?  This guy named Dakota. 
[00:39:30]  I missed about one vote.  If I had voted and my sidekick voted, I would have won by one vote.  So, whatever.  How many people voted?  Four?  I think 78 or so.  I don't know.  That guy's show just had more people involved in it than Scorch's.  Yeah, that's what it is.  He stuffed the ballot box.  He went to the ballot box.  Did he have just a little more inflection on his voice than you when he was introducing  the songs?  Hey, he scoops with an echo behind his voice, voice, voice, voice.  One of those guys.  But other than that, everything.  Did he do one extra rock block than you and that put him over the top?  Yeah, he could very well. 
[00:40:00]  I think it's all the, I'm pretty sure it's all the Bismarck key that they still spin.  Yeah.  You know, tomorrow on the show, not that you can pick it up down there, but I'm doing a.  Hey, we want to still talk about the best of Syracuse?  Yeah, what about the station itself?  Station one, our station one, best of, fifth year in a row.  Goddamn, bless you.  Bless you.  Bravo.  Actually, I think it's going okay.  I can't really squawk.  You can't.  I can't really squawk these days except winter's coming and that kind of sucks.  It snowed here the other day.  Oh, dear.  It started snowing already?  It snowed here, no lie. 
[00:40:30]  Sunday night, Monday morning, it was snowing when I hit the road.  Oh, man.  Bringing back my buffalo memories, my friend.  Can you imagine that?  It was anthrax, man.  It wasn't snowing, it wasn't snowing, it could have been anthrax, who knows.  But I want to say, hey, I still get, like, so many emails and correspondences from people  that listen to the ONA show.  Have you got one correspondent from maybe a PD in a bigger market, Scorch?  With all this exposure we're giving you, I think someone should be calling you.  Yes.  Okay, well, there you go.  So if there's a PD in a bigger market, I would love to do this talk radio thing, man. 
[00:41:00]  You know, if you want somebody like me to be a part of your station, KROC.com.  Scorch.  S-C-O-R-C-H.  KROC.com.  Don't forget it.  All right.  Scorch, have you done anything to help out or have you done any tributes or have you spoken  about the situation on the air?  What situation?  How is Scorch handling?  Did you do a can drive, the bombing, I mean, the disaster at the World Trade Center and  Pentagon and the attack on Afghanistan?  Have you incorporated that into your kingdom of nakedness? 
[00:41:30]  Actually, I stopped a couple weeks ago.  It's kind of what we just talked about now.  You can't really harp on it, harp on it, harp on it, but we know it's there.  Everybody knows it's there.  We're just trying not to harp on it.  We're trying to let life go on.  I'm thinking Scorch's nude army invading Afghanistan, you know, and you do like a bit like that.  That would scare people away.  I said, they'll drive them out of the holes.  We're doing a thing called Bush or Pussy tomorrow.  Can I tell you about that?  Bush or Pussy.  Bush or Pussy.  Yeah, it's a very good game.  You can use it.  It's another one.  It's another one of my Zachy, weeny Zachy stunts. 
[00:42:00]  Okay.  We take a scientific name of a tree or a scientific name of a cat and we let people decide whether  it's a bush or a pussy.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  Bush or Pussy.  Yeah, and that's actually...  Bush or Pussy.  You know, let me tell you, in central New York, that works.  I like doucher dressing better.  Doucher dressing is very good.  Doucher dressing has been...  And I used...  Who was on your show last time I spoke to you that said used...  What did you say?  Rancher yeast infection, which went over extremely well. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, it did.  Look at that.  Yeah, so it went over extremely well.  I'm still waiting for the lemon mist, which you told me about, Anthony.  Yes.  So that might be the next time.  Hey, Scorch, who won best hamburger in Syracuse?  I don't really know, but the best pizza was won by me because I am pizza, you know.  You know what I mean?  I am not hamburgers anymore.  I am pizza and I'm damn proud of it.  I'm going to go film like a...  I got to go film a TV thing today.  I'm doing like a dinner movie thing.  Oh.  Oh, for what network? 
[00:43:00]  It's for the CBS affiliate up here.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah, so...  So what do you do?  You intro the movie and then you come back during the commercial breaks and...  And I cook.  I'll be cooking something.  You're cooking?  I'm cooking, man.  Scorch.  What are you going to cook?  Is there any way and possible we can get a videotape of this?  Yeah, you got to tape this.  Yeah, it's going to be taped.  You guys want a tape of it?  Hell yeah.  I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll make a deal with you, okay?  He's going to be like the movie host.  Right, you know, that dinner and a movie. 
[00:43:30]  He's doing dinner and a movie?  Yes.  You fang!  Local CBS affiliate up in Syracuse.  That's not good.  Yeah, yeah, so...  What kind of pajamas are you going to be wearing?  I'm actually going to be wearing...  It's a midnight pajama party.  Since I do club naked, they told me I can go naked and I'll just blurt it out.  Scorch.  Scorch.  Yeah.  Kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  Do you have a co-host?  Scorch.  Yeah, my co-host is my co-host in the morning.  Right, and you're going to be cooking what?  Today, for Halloween, since we're hosting with Fabian Tonight, but it's going to be airing Halloween weekend. 
[00:44:00]  We're doing a Halloween show.  Uh-huh.  I think I'm going to make, instead of bruschetta, being a gay radio disc jockey, I'm going to call it bruschetta, which is kind of nice.  I don't know what he's...  Like brusch?  As in B-O-O or as in...  Yeah, like brusch.  Bruschetta.  Oh, brusch.  I thought you meant like a bush.  Oh, no, no, no.  Bruschetta.  Okay.  That's scary.  I don't know what else.  I think we're going to cook...  My sidekick's name is Y.  She just calls herself Y, so she's going to be making some Y pie, which could be kind of nice. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, that's like to eat at the Y.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, and Y pie is a big thing.  Y pie is like the biggest thing up here right now.  Hey, Scorch, did you do the bush or pussy bit from...  Did you get that from Prep Burger?  No, I don't use any of those prep sheets because my station won't let me get them because they can't afford the barter spots for free.  Good, go figure.  Thanks in hell.  So here's what I want to do, if I could.  I'll give you guys a videotape of this thing that I'm doing tonight, but I want to come to the city.  I want you guys...  I'm going to ask a favor of you, and I feel really humbled by doing it, but I want to ask a favor. 
[00:45:00]  I want you guys to host some sort of party in the city that I can get to where I can meet all these people that keep emailing me and whatnot.  Oh, look at that.  You want to get laid, in other words.  You want to use this program to get laid.  I want to meet all these people in one fell swoop because I get literally hundreds of emails a week.  What's that?  Do you need to get laid?  Just say yes on the air, and the Bettys will come out of the woodwork for you.  I don't need to get laid.  Would you like it?  Oh, I always like to get laid.  Yeah, that's cool. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  Totally, dude.  Thanks again to you guys for hooking me up.  People, my pal Arte out in California, the sex dude, you should have this guy on your show.  Hey, Scorch.  What's that?  What's the hot tune that you're spinning these days on the air?  What's the hottest rock song right now?  The hottest modern rock song right now, I don't...  It probably could still be...  It could still be like Smooth Criminal by Alien Antfar.  It might be fake still.  I still love that song.  So, Scorch, is K-Rock up there celebrating Rocktober? 
[00:46:00]  No, we don't do stuff like that.  You're not the Rocktober station in Syracuse?  No, we're not.  We don't do the so many days of summer.  We don't do anything, man.  You listen to me.  I tell you every day.  We don't do nothing.  Scorch, could you send an air check?  Because we've got to play your show for every time.  We'd love to hear what you do on the air.  I would...  I'll send you an air check in a heartbeat.  My new goal is to get you the hell out of Syracuse.  That would be nice.  O&A, my new goal is to let you do that for me.  So, no, that's cool.  I appreciate it.  Anything you want to do, that's cool.  All right. 
[00:46:30]  But let me say hey to my peeps in Boston, my peeps in Hall, Massachusetts, all over the  place.  California, I'm getting correspondence from all over the city.  You can join us in Boston.  We're going to do a little something-something soon there in Boston.  Let me know when.  I'll be there.  All right.  Hey, Joey Big Arms wants to know, why haven't I heard a dog bark yet?  I said that because I'm locked myself in a goddamn room, so you can't hear my dogs barking.  All right.  The dog barked at the beginning of the call.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  That's pretty funny, though.  I'll bring them with me.  You'll love them.  They're great.  You know, I think the Bush or Pussy thing is going to stink tomorrow, bro. 
[00:47:00]  No, it ain't.  And I also have Nicky Cox on tomorrow, so if anything stinks, you know, Nicky Cox will make  it all better.  Yeah, what?  You're going to have 20 publicity people in there with her.  You're not going to be able to ask her anything about how it is to have to bang  Bobcat Goldthwait.  I got him coming in November 1st.  He's going to be at the Turning Stone Casino Resort up here.  He's from up here.  His mom still lives in Syracuse.  Thank God.  Dude, get on a plane.  And get out.  And sprint as hard as you can toward the cockpit while they're 10,000 feet above America. 
[00:47:30]  You'll get some press.  You'll get some press.  You'll get some press.  That's the easiest way to get press these days.  It would appear that way.  That's cool.  But thanks again for having me on.  I appreciate it.  No problem, Scorch.  Hey, your cousin's calling.  Who's my cousin?  Michelle.  Yeah.  Is Scorch really your cousin?  Yep.  He's actually Gary Goldstein.  Oh, that's bad, Michelle.  Actually, that's not even my name anymore, though. 
[00:48:00]  I know.  Dave Anthony.  No, no.  Let me ask you guys now.  Think of that.  Would you change your name if your name was Gary Goldstein?  Come on.  You know, I don't think there was a funnier name out there than Opie, but I just found  it.  Gary Goldstein.  Gary Goldstein.  Hey, it's Gary Goldstein.  Wept ya.  Gary Goldstein.  Hey, let me tell you, man.  When I was in college.  We got a 40-minute non-stop rock block.  When I was in college, I was known as the rock and roll rabbi.  What?  That would have been good. 
[00:48:30]  The rock and roll rabbi.  I was known when I was in college.  Scorch.  Scorch.  You're Jewish?  Oh, what, are you going to hang up on me now?  No.  Yeah.  I just think it's funny, that's all.  We didn't know you were a Jewish, Scorch.  Very handsome boy.  Oh, well, you can't come.  Thank you, Michelle.  Oh.  That's pretty funny.  Wow.  Well, thank you for putting me through.  Oh, whatever.  Michelle.  You're going to ruin my career.  Oy vey.  Mazel tov.  Kingdom of Nakedness.  Tell mom and dad we should hate.  I will.  Okay.  And your brother.  Bye, honey. 
[00:49:00]  Bye.  Totally nude radio.  I told her to say that, by the way.  My name is never Gary Goldstein.  That's just a radio shtick.  Oh, God.  Your name is Gary Goldstein.  Oh.  Can you imagine that?  Oh, my God.  Manish, it's a man juice.  We've known you all these years.  We just...  Yeah, so that's why I got my name legally changed in 1982.  I got my name legally changed.  What a good boy, Gary.  Wait, Gary.  So you went from Gary Goldstein to what?  Seriously?  Dave Anthony?  Dave Anthony, yeah.  Dave Anthony, that's keeping with the two first names as the whole name radio DJ thing. 
[00:49:30]  But that's my legal name.  A la Dave Douglas.  I was actually going to change it legally to Scorch as well, but it's just too much of a hassle at this point.  Totally nude radio at the temple.  And it's called Club Naked from here on in, boys.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Club Naked?  Yeah, it's a big thing.  We're getting the webpage.  It should be up and running next Friday.  Dude, I like the kingdom of nakedness.  Club Naked is a little gay.  Not a...  A little gay.  Hey, kingdom of nakedness, I picture a whole kingdom and everyone's naked. 
[00:50:00]  You know, it's so...  Club Naked is, I figure...  With sectors and stuff.  Gay sex and glory holes.  That's Club Naked in a nutshell.  Thank you very much.  I'm glad.  No, it's national.  That's cool.  Gary Goldstein runs Club Naked.  Gary Goldstein.  Scorch runs the kingdom of naked.  That might be the thing.  Scorch runs the kingdom.  Gary Goldstein runs Club Naked.  Your website's going to have a lot of neon colors.  Hey, is there going to be a special whoopee room in Club Naked?  A whoopee room?  Yeah, there might be.  That's actually a good idea.  I've stolen everything else from your show.  I might as well steal that, too.  Hey, Sean, you're on with Scorch. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, I got a new name for your show, Scorch.  What's that, Sean?  What's that?  What's that?  What rules.  What?  Totally Jude Radio.  Totally Jude Radio.  Totally Jude Radio, yeah.  Yeah, I'm working rules, man.  You're the best.  All right, Sean, thanks.  All right.  Scorch, you're getting killed.  Well, you know, man, I was going to be a cross-dresser and call myself Jew, Paul.  I know.  Don't have Jay Moore on your show.  He'll call you a Heber or a Jew.  My nickname all throughout school was Heber, actually. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, God.  Gary Goldstein.  Yeah.  Are you going to celebrate Hanukkah, the kingdom of Nakedness?  Yeah.  Jew or Gentile?  That's going to be a game, Jew or Gentile.  Remember when I was in Boston, I used to do the game Black or White.  Remember when I used to take the jail, the arrest listings, and we used to just read them off on the air  and let people guess whether they're black or white by the name?  Yeah.  That's a good game, too.  Can't do that.  Can't figure out why you're in Syracuse.  Yeah, me neither.  God damn Scott.  Cut or uncut?  We don't have to play that because we're all nude. 
[00:51:30]  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Club nude.  Club naked, God damn it.  Club naked.  I don't like it, Scorch.  Well, that's because you're not used to it yet.  Club naked.  Club naked.  I picture like techno.  The kingdom of nakedness.  Techno.  You think so?  Yeah, I should stick to the kingdom of.  Tell me if kingdom of nakedness is up for grabs.  We'll steal that one.  No, it definitely is.  We'll work it into our show somehow.  Yeah, we'll work it into your show somehow. 
[00:52:00]  That's cool.  Kingdom of nakedness rocks.  Club naked or club nude.  Can I ask you a question?  How come you want to change it from kingdom of nakedness?  It's just we're trying to.  It's not even that we.  More people are apt to get involved with this thing called club naked.  We get more people into like a.  Who figured this out?  I did.  Can you tell?  It sounds like a Robin Williams movie from the 80s.  Club naked.  That's, I think, what I got.  It's going to be fun.  We're all naked.  But so we'll see what happens. 
[00:52:30]  Who knows?  Time to play.  Whip out your yarmulke.  Do you have a yarmulke?  Because you've got a weird hairstyle, my friend.  I don't have a yarmulke.  How do you pull off the yarmulke with that?  In Temple.  I had my bar mitzvah at a Papa Gino's Pizza Place.  In English.  Bar mitzvah or bar?  Oh, you're hilarious, man.  I love this.  You never disappoint.  I don't know why there's not a program director calling you up right now.  Mine is a little balls. 
[00:53:00]  It may be after this, but they're going to ask for Goldstein and I ain't going to be around.  Gary Goldstein.  Remember that.  That name will be forever embedded in your head from here on in.  How'd you get Scorch then?  Yeah.  Scorch is cool.  Where'd that come from?  Because I throw fire in my wrestling gimmick.  Which, I was listening to you talk about them fire girls.  That's kind of, I should go on stage with them.  You throw fire.  You never knew that's how I got my name?  You were Scorch, so you scorched the people.  You swear to me, you never knew that's how I got the name Scorch?  No.  Scorch has the worst luck.  He's stuck in Syracuse doing radio, and he knows everyone from the WWF. 
[00:53:30]  Worked with all the huge stars in the WWF.  Help me?  Hell no.  He knows Triple H real well.  Yeah.  X-Pac, right?  Yeah, all of them.  Actually, yeah.  You know China?  Yeah.  She's gone, but that's you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  I think I'm destined to be in central New York.  Until I send you a tape, and then you can rip me to shreds on a day.  I don't have to hear it.  All right, Scorch, you've got to send...  I'm going to send a video tape.  A video tape.  You're hosting the pajama party.  Yeah.  What movie are they showing?  Nightmare on Elm Street Part 4.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[00:54:00]  That's a cool movie.  You like that?  Yep.  And then you've got to send us your radio show so we can have fun with that.  I definitely will.  How about that Freddy Krueger?  Yeah.  Well, you imagine what he looks like, totally dude.  Yeah.  Something like that.  We'll do it.  All right.  He can do his own circumcision.  Very good.  That's what you do.  Yeah, I'll definitely send that stuff down.  And hook me up with a gig, boys.  Well, we're trying.  Okay.  All right.  Fair enough.  Thanks, Scorch.  Mazel tov.  Always a pleasure, boys.  Have fun on the Club Naked show tomorrow.  Bye, United States of America. 
[00:54:30]  Thanks again.  We appreciate it.  All right, Scorch.  See you, man.  Bye-bye.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  How about it?  Gary Goldstein.  Gary Goldstein.  You know, you could have put that on a choice of, let's see, you get a piece of paper,  you write down two names.  One of them's Gary Goldstein.  I would guarantee I would have picked the other name for Scorch.  Gary Goldstein.  Did you see that coming as far as him being Jewish?  No.  No.  It's okay.  Trust me.  It's just fine.  Oh, it's fine. 
[00:55:00]  It's just he doesn't fit the, I guess, the stereotype.  See?  We shouldn't pay attention to these stereotypes.  Phew.  All right.  The fire-breathing guy's calling back.  AJ.  Yo.  You didn't hang up on us, did you?  No, I don't know what happened.  I got disconnected.  Although, after hearing you guys talk, I'm sitting there worried about telling you what  my real name, real full name is.  What's your full name there, AJ?  Shalom Arthur Jason Cohen.  Shalom is your first name.  That's my first name. 
[00:55:30]  Wow.  You were brought up in a very Jewish family.  Yes, unfortunately.  Shalom.  It's better than, like, Schmoyle or one of those names.  Well, hey, there's nothing worse than having that name.  And then if you know anything about it, there's like four songs with my name in it.  No, I don't know anything about that.  So, AJ, how long is your act going to be on Wednesday?  It's going to be probably two songs long, which is about eight to nine minutes. 
[00:56:00]  It's about one song too many, but okay.  Trust me.  I don't know if you're...  You'll pipe down over there.  I can't wait to see the fire-breathing chicks.  Oh, you'll see the chicks fire-breathing.  You'll see me fire-breathing.  I'm fire-breathing a whole...  I'm the only fire-breather around that I know of that breathes through a mask.  Sir?  What?  Sir?  Yeah.  Is the mistress attractive?  Yes, she is.  Very.  Does she...  Do you know what type of a session she offers for a fee?  Um...  Pretty much anything you can handle.  Really?  Oh.  Were you looking to purchase something there? 
[00:56:30]  Just curious if...  If, like, say you want your face used as a chair.  They do that too.  Oh, there you go.  Face smothering.  Okay.  And use it as a toilet, Norton.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, actually, believe it or not, one of the twins is also a professional mistress as well.  Probably the fat one, right?  The fat one, obviously.  No.  Nice.  No, it's a good-looking one.  Oh, my one is a dominatrix.  There's two dominatrixes who will be on stage.  Yeah.  And one fat, fire-breathing chick.  I like that, though.  Yeah, but any girl that's going to sit there and breathe fire, you know, for about a 10-foot flame, 
[00:57:00]  are you going to argue with her?  No, you're right.  AJ, we might put you on the stage around...  What time do the doors open?  7.  How's 6.45?  Trust me.  You'd want to bet...  This show will knock you and blow you away.  Come on, Opie.  Behave yourself.  All right.  I'm sorry.  We do have audio of the fat girl breathing fire.  Wow. 
[00:57:30]  AJ, do you know how to pick up a 7-10 split?  Not easily.  I'm having trouble with the 7-10 split.  Thanks, AJ.  Hey, no problem, guys.  All right, bye.  That sounds cool.  Two dominatrixes, man.  Nice.  Cody!  What's up?  What's up, man?  Hey, I'm calling a little early, so I'm not even listening yet, but you know you guys  are going to get your buds kicked tonight by the A's, right?  Oh, here we go.  Well, it was a good start for you guys.  You know what?  I can't jump on the bandwagon. 
[00:58:00]  What's up with Pettit?  I don't like the A's.  I don't like the Yankees.  Pettit's good, man.  I think if it's a way to...  I think if they come back, Pettit will be the one that brings them back.  They shut him out last year in the playoffs.  That guarantees A's a win.  Thank you.  A's got by Clemens, though.  I don't have the curse.  He's always had problems with them.  Cody, it's not me that has the curse, my friend.  Oh, he does?  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  He's a Met fan, dude.  And the curse only works if there's passion involved.  I could care less about the A's, and I don't really care about the Yankees either, so... 
[00:58:30]  Oh, well, you're liking the Yankees.  I know you are.  Hey, dude.  Oh, Diamondbacks!  Diamondbacks!  Randy Johnson!  Hey, can I get that shot?  Wait, here's my impression.  Here's my impression of Randy Johnson during the playoffs every single year.  Oh, thank God Bonds couldn't do him out this year.  A big unit.  That's why, you know, he's in a big mule.  That's why he has that name.  That's true.  Well, of course.  I think he gets so excited during the playoffs that he can't get around on that fastball 
[00:59:00]  because something's in the way.  All the blood comes out of his head.  When are you guys going to come out to Sacramento?  Hmm?  When are you guys going to come out to Sacramento?  K-X-O-A!  K-X-O-A!  K-X-O-A!  You know what?  We love Sacramento, and the PD over there is really, really cool, and we're working on  some things.  It'd be nice.  We get a little show.  You know those other guys, Doug and Mark or whatever their names are?  They've come out here before and done a little show.  Been pretty good, successful.  Doug and Mark.  No clue.  I know. 
[00:59:30]  Don and Mike.  Faggots.  What?  I didn't say that.  I did.  No, this is what we're going to do.  We're going to Philly next week.  All right.  Then we've got something special for Boston.  Then we're going to stop down in Washington.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe bowl a few frames.  Yeah.  And then we'll go to Sacramento.  All right.  All right.  That's cool.  You guys suck.  Take it easy.  All right.  Bye.  Steve from Philly checking in, saying a scorcher show should be called The Morning Jew with 
[01:00:00]  the Jew crew.  With Gary Goldstein, as your host.  Gary Goldstein.  Sounds like he should be like a game show emcee, I think.  Gary Goldstein.  All right.  Do we have to take a break?  Aye.  Sergeant Hartman next.  Sergeant Hartman next.  Nice.  Frank Caliendo.  Very soon.  Can we give him a little something as we go to break?  How about that OJ crank call?  The one Kid Chris from Sacramento sent us. 
[01:00:30]  OJ.  Back in court.  Kid Chris, a good friend of the show.  Don't even know him, but we feel like we do.  We'll meet him when we get out to Sacramento.  He got OJ's cell phone and just messed with him over and over again.  And he got a girl to call OJ.  Check this out.  You want the girl one?  Yeah, definitely want the girl one.  We played the other one a million times already.  Yeah.  And it is a shame with everything that's going on in the country today that we can't really  relish that OJ is in court again and might face a prison time, which I'm just psyched 
[01:01:00]  about.  He ain't going to prison.  You don't think so?  No.  I think the right jury and the right judge will say, all right, you didn't pay for the  murder thing, but road rage, that's worth about five years.  Like, give him the max.  Eh.  No?  Ain't going to happen.  I would just, I would love to say it.  I don't know what we can do with Blind Dave.  Hey.  You don't want to talk about what you're about to do?  All I can say is I'm at a secret location about to embark on a mission.  Okay.  I can't describe any details, but I will be calling you back with details later. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, if that's not a good radio tease.  Okay.  I think some people probably can figure it out.  Okay.  Blind Dave.  Let's not.  Blind Dave, completely blind, a good friend of the show.  He did blind boxing for us and broke four ribs, bruised a spleen and a kidney.  Made an ass out of himself.  You're about to embark on a mission.  Yes.  And you'll let us know how it goes afterwards.  Yes.  Oh, nice.  I think that's all I can say right now. 
[01:02:00]  I just figured it out, my friend.  Okay.  Well, let's.  All right.  No, that's cool.  That's good enough for us.  I'll call you guys back.  How long will it take?  I don't know.  Okay.  I can't discuss details right now.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  I could threaten the mission.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  We can't find it?  Oh, we got it?  All right.  So, yeah, here's a chick calling OJ's cell phone number.  This is real.  Not put together in a radio studio. 
[01:02:30]  This actually went down.  As it cues out.  Oh.  Here we go.  We'll be back.  Hello?  Hi, OJ.  It's Kelly.  What's going on?  What are you doing?  I am talking on the phone.  Good one.  Where are you?  Actually, I'm at home right now.  Where?  I'm at home.  And what's going on?  Nothing.  So, what did you do this afternoon?  Pardon me?  What did you do this afternoon?  I played golf.  But you know what?  I'm on the other line right now.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, OJ.  Hey, will you come pick me up?  I'm in the mood.  Oh, boy.  You want to go kill someone tonight?  No, not really.  Not really.  Didn't sound fun?  Yeah.  Maybe later.  Okay.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye.  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  With Drowning Pool bodies.  I got to tell you, I feel really bad for Drowning Pool. 
[01:03:30]  They had so much heat.  A lot of momentum going for them.  This was one of the hottest songs in America.  Every alternative rock, modern rock, even regular rock stations were jamming this song.  Yeah.  And then the World Trade Center thing happened, and every radio station dropped this song  from their playlist.  And it had nothing to do with, well, the song is about moshing.  Right.  But, you know.  But I guess it was too close to what was going on.  Exactly. 
[01:04:00]  So everyone dropped the record, and Drowning Pool just basically went away.  I mean, horrible break for these guys.  Them and Anthrax having a tough time with it.  Them and Anthrax.  They put a little statement on their website, Anthrax, saying that they won't be changing  their name.  Originally, they made a joke, like, yeah, they were going to change it to Basket Full of  Puppies.  But then they said, no, we're not going to change it.  You know, not because it's a big pain in the ass, but because we're just hoping that nothing 
[01:04:30]  else bad happens, and this whole thing just goes away.  I'm not worried about the Anthrax.  You're not?  Nah.  It's not contagious.  It's not from person to person.  It's not contagious.  Frank Caliendo?  Yes, me.  Not from person to person, but, hey, you know, you get some of that wacky stuff on you.  Look, I don't know.  If you can get it from a keyboard, you could probably get it from a person.  I got it from a computer keyboard.  No, the spore's got to get up your nose.  Depends what you're sniffing.  Yeah.  Give me a sniff.  God only knows where Norton's nose has been. 
[01:05:00]  I think Anthrax is the least deal.  You got to sniff in the spores.  Five bucks one time to put my tongue in.  Hey, uh, so, listen, Frank Caliendo in the studio, we're going to get to him in a second.  I mean, jump in whenever you want, Frank, but we got to interrupt your appearance for  Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Arley.  Army.  Right here.  Sergeant Hartman.  How are we doing today?  I was just sitting here wondering how I can get involved in this conversation that's going 
[01:05:30]  on here about Anthrax.  Yeah.  You dig the Anthrax, Sergeant Hartman?  I don't think it's a threat.  The only way it could possibly be a threat is if they feed it, if they infect the animals  and we eat the beef.  Right.  You know, then it's a threat, but good Lord.  I mean, who's going to go, it's got to be, it goes up your nose.  Right.  It has to be an airborne germ.  Yeah.  Mr.  And it's not.  I just wanted to say, this is Jim Norton, my friend Happy Face and I are big fans, and 
[01:06:00]  I just look at your doll and it inspires me.  Yeah, you have an action figure.  Oh, do you guys have the doll?  Oh, we have it right there.  We can't play any of its sounds on the air.  Well, you know, it's kind of rough.  I like it.  A little rough around the edges, but, you know, a drill instructor, that's the way the  drill instructor talks.  Exactly.  I love it.  Hell, he can't talk if he can't swear.  I love it.  Hey, sir, what is your current location in Afghanistan right now? 
[01:06:30]  You know, I volunteered to go back in uniform.  I really did.  You did.  And, you know, let's be realistic.  I'm 57 years old.  I wouldn't be worth a damn on the field of battle.  I don't know about that.  However, I'm a great motivator.  I think you'd make Ben Lin, you know, leak his pants.  Well, I would just have to, I would love to go around and just keep the troops motivated.  How long were you a DI for?  I was a drill instructor at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in 1965, 6, and 7. 
[01:07:00]  And you did one and a half tours of Vietnam.  I did just over one tour in Vietnam.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  But I was in the rear with the gear.  The only, we had, we would take a cack platoon out occasionally to a village.  And, you know, we didn't really get real too serious about fighting the war.  We took rockets.  Really?  So don't, don't, don't even, I'm not a hero.  I want to, I want to get that across right off the bat.  All right.  You're a hero in the movies, though.  I got hurt.  You are inspiring.  I got hurt getting in the bunker, guys. 
[01:07:30]  Ah, did you?  Ah, you're killing us by telling us this stuff.  No, it's fine.  I know you love this vision of Audie Murphy charging up the hill, but it doesn't work.  So we'll just keep it, keep it down to earth today.  I hate seeing Superman without his cape.  You're like the manliest man.  I don't want to hear this crap.  Well, I'm a famous drill instructor is what I am.  And that's what I did most of my time in the Marine Corps was I taught people things. 
[01:08:00]  And I was an instructor and I was a very good instructor.  And that's what I, I, I like to draw from when I do film.  How'd you get, how'd you get to make the, uh, the transition into movies?  Somebody must have seen you and thought, oh my God, this guy's the definitive drill instructor.  See, you make it sound real goddamn simple.  See, the deal is here, is you have, if you decide this is something you want to do, you have to make sure that you're seen. 
[01:08:30]  Number one, you don't, just don't accidentally get seen around here.  No.  So there you go.  But anyway, we made it happen.  How do you get seen?  You stand out on the corner.  You are a disgusting fat body.  You know, what do you do?  No, I was, uh, I had, uh, we were doing Vietnam.  They started doing Vietnam war shows in the Philippines and I just happened to be there.  And so I, I started doing technical advice.  So I was, I kind of had a, my foot in the door.  What is a Vietnam war show? 
[01:09:00]  A movie.  Oh, they were doing a movie in the Philippines.  Yeah.  And, uh, you, you got your foot in the door?  After I was retired.  Okay.  I went, I was single.  So I said, hell, I'm not really too happy about hanging around here.  You went to the Philippines to find a bride.  Uh, I went to the, I actually went to the Philippines to, uh, to party.  Yeah.  And, and I, uh, had to make money while I was partying so that I could party.  Although I was retired from the Marine Corps, so I was getting a small check. 
[01:09:30]  You get one taste of those women over there and, uh, the American women just don't cut it anymore.  Is that it?  Well, well, you know how it is.  I, I, I just, everybody has their little style of women.  Me so, honey.  You like that?  And I had to have one with a, a flat head and a butt that sticks out.  So, so I could put the ashtray on her head and, and, uh, rest my beer on her butt.  I like it.  You're the greatest man alive.  And I found one, see.  I mean, I wasn't particular.  It could have been just any race. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  It just, I decided I'd start looking in the Philippines.  Can I ask a question?  What I want?  Because the dialogue was so brilliant in Full Metal Jacket.  How much of that did you add?  Or how much did, did Kubrick and the writers put in?  Uh, uh, when I got there, the first half of that film stunk.  Trust me.  And, uh, really modest.  And I told Stanley, when Stanley called me on the phone, I told him, Stanley, he asked  me, he says, have you, have you read The Short Timers, Gustav Ashford's novel, The Short  Timers? 
[01:10:30]  I'm basing a film on that.  And, and what do you think of the, the, the book?  And I said, well, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, funny, Stanley, but I, it's just laced with  fictitious bullcrap.  Right.  And Stanley, right away, I had Stanley's attention.  I guess.  And he, and so I came over and he and I sat down and actually rewrote the first half of  the show.  Yeah, that, that was brilliant.  Too bad you didn't, uh, rewrite the second half of the, uh, movie.  Well, you know, it's, uh, it's, it's like it just loses its momentum after you leave 
[01:11:00]  boot camp because boot camp is really a tough act to follow.  Let's face it, guys.  You should have been out there in the field just giving them hell.  The whole movie was you.  It was all, you know, that's like porno for guys watching Full Metal Jacket.  The first half is phenomenal.  Oh, well, thank you.  Gee, I don't know.  Is that a compliment?  Yes.  Yes.  It's pleasurable, you know.  I'm totally straight.  I did do a show.  I am getting a few little remarks because I did do a show earlier that was released earlier 
[01:11:30]  this year called Saving Silverman where I kissed Jack Black.  Right.  Yeah.  We had Jack in here yesterday.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yeah.  How does he kiss?  Very kissable, isn't he?  He's a cute little guy.  You know, when they told me I was going to kiss Jack Black, I said, you know, I couldn't  think of anybody I'd rather kiss.  Really?  I had done a show with Jack Black with Sean Penn.  It was called Dead Man Walking, right?  Yeah.  And Jack Black was one of Sean Penn's brothers in Dead Man Walking. 
[01:12:00]  Did you put him on his knees and make him choke himself?  No, no.  As a matter of fact, I played the role of a homicidal gay high school football coach in  this show.  Yeah.  Nice.  So, you see, it was a very good comedy, I thought.  Very slapstick.  It was like Three Stooges comedy.  Did you slip them the tongue?  Oh, no.  No tongue, no wet.  No, no.  That's good. 
[01:12:30]  No benefits, no extras.  No ups, no downs.  It's like I told him, if I feel anything stiffening up, it's over with, buddy.  So, anyway, Jack and I really got along great.  I think he's got a hard on.  How many people do that, just come up to you and start quoting your lines from movies?  You know, everybody, every guy in America knows them.  I go to, I can't go out anymore without being, you know, everybody knows me. 
[01:13:00]  Sure.  And, but my guys are all, my fans, the people that like what I do are all gentlemen.  Yeah.  You see, they come up and introduce themselves and then they excuse themselves after they  make a comment or say hello.  So, and, so that makes it, life is still enjoyable.  Nobody wants a lock of my hair.  No, huh?  They're not, yeah, mugging you on the street.  What do you think of this whole situation? 
[01:13:30]  What's your take on this military action we're engaged in?  The World Trade Center needs to be, there needs to be retaliation and, you know, I've been  sitting here, I've been sitting here watching the terrorists grow and grow from the old days  back in Gaddafi all the way up to what it is now and these terrorists have grown leaps  and bounds and if we don't stop them here, we're not going to be able to stop them.  God damn it.  The thing that worries me most about this situation is if it becomes a holy war, then 
[01:14:00]  it is a problem.  So we had best watch our public relations and we had best treat those people properly over  there and go in and win the hearts and minds of the people.  We're feeding them.  We're trying to feed the good people and we're trying to be very surgical about when we hit  the country and we're trying desperately not to hurt anybody that is not Taliban. 
[01:14:30]  Jesus H. Christ.  Coming from you.  That's fantastic.  You got anything left in your voice to give us a little something there?  I've always got something.  Can you like working?  Would you like the first scene?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay, I've got to close the door here.  Okay, here it comes.  You ready?  All right.  And then I have to talk about something that's near and dear to my heart.  I've got an interactive video that I'm dying to talk about. 
[01:15:00]  Hell yeah.  You ready for this?  Yes, sir.  Here it goes.  I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  I am your senior drill instructor.  From now on, you will speak only when spoken to.  That first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be, sir.  Do you maggots understand that?  You've got a pair.  Sir, yes, sir.  If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon.  You will be a minister of death praying for war. 
[01:15:30]  But until that day, you are pukes.  You are scumbags.  You are the lowest form of life on earth.  You are not even human.  See, it gets dirty.  Goddamn.  I got the chills, my friend.  Boy, that guy yelling at you.  Isn't that great?  Oh, I love it.  Poetry.  What do you got there?  Oh, I see I'm all worn out.  Are you going to pass out? 
[01:16:00]  Well, I'm a non-smoker, and I humped the golf course every morning carrying my bag.  I'm actually in pretty good shape, guys.  I went down, the commanding officer over at 3rd Ladd Battalion up at Camp Pendleton called me  and asked me if I'd come down and go on a six-mile force night march with him and the troops to motivate them.  And I thought, oh, boy, these guys are going to walk my butt off.  Right.  Actually, I led off, and they were huffing and puffing by the time I got them back up the hill to camp. 
[01:16:30]  Could you imagine, though?  You look around, you turn around, and it's him?  There he is.  Oh, my God.  The guys must have been very happy.  Well, once we got back, once we got, because I just had a cup of drink of coffee,  but once we got back up on the hill, we then bivouacked, and guess what?  There was about five kegs of beer up there on that hill.  Oh, nice.  We took possession of it, and we made sure that it was well taken care of for the rest of the evening. 
[01:17:00]  Fantastic.  And they call that Warrior Night, and it's just something that their commanding officer,  who is now a dear friend of mine, came up with, and, boy, is that a great motivator.  I bet.  Now, what do you got working on you wanted to talk about?  Okay, here's the deal.  Last year, Simon & Schuster approached me.  Actually, earlier this year, Simon & Schuster approached me with a video game they asked me if I would narrate and do. 
[01:17:30]  Well, I don't generally do video games.  I'm an actor.  Right.  And so I was a bit hesitant.  They sent me a script.  I read this script, and I've got to tell you, people, this is the greatest video game.  My son just loves this video.  He said, Dad, this is the coolest.  My son knows video games.  Wait a second.  John Madden here, and great video games are great. 
[01:18:00]  And you do have a great video game.  Yeah.  Okay, so there you go.  We need to let people know this.  It's called Real War.  Real War.  And people need to, folks, if they're gamers, they need to get out and get this.  You know, I know about this one.  Have you tried it?  Have you played it?  I just got it.  I know it was actually a training device for the Joint Chiefs.  Yes.  It was adapted from that, and very entertaining.  This is the most realistic video game I've ever seen. 
[01:18:30]  Well, they use my game in the NFL.  These guys, yeah.  I mean, the gamers can, you know, they've got all kinds of helicopters and tanks and everything  at their disposal.  You wage war, yeah.  Four of them can wage war on the Internet.  Four players.  And you're yelling and screaming throughout the whole game, or what?  No, I'm just telling them how to win.  Just a little motivation.  Listen to me, they might just have a chance of winning.  Cool. 
[01:19:00]  Gives the people a little motivation.  Yeah, there you go, motivating.  Nothing beats a quote like, boom, that guy looks like he got hit by a freight train.  Yeah, the old drill instructor breaks it down, basically, and says, okay, here's what you're  dealing with.  Right.  You know, and here's what you've got to work with.  So, you know, it's a great video.  Yeah.  And they had to tell me that that wasn't actually a helicopter at the opening of it,  because I would have sworn it was a helicopter.  They're getting amazing with the graphics. 
[01:19:30]  They're getting absolutely, totally amazing.  All right, real war.  So, anyway, if folks want to check this thing out, look at, there's a website.  It's called www.real-ward.com.  All right.  Sir, I have an important question for you.  I thought he was going to pull a buddy Epson on us.  Sorry, go ahead, sir.  Do you think that Sergeant Hulka was a pussy?  Sergeant who?  Hulka.  See?  Sergeant Hulka.  Who in the hell was Sergeant Hulka?  Stripes.  From Stripes. 
[01:20:00]  Don't know him.  See?  Oh, no, I do know who you're talking about now.  Well, there's a guy who thought about it and came up with an answer.  No, yeah, I know who you're talking about.  It's a black guy, right?  No, that was Gossett from Officer and Gentleman.  No, no, no, no.  Just, uh, you're talking about the Sarge.  Sergeant Hulka is a white guy.  He was a white guy.  From the movie Stripes, from Bill Murray.  Then I wasn't impressed.  Black guy, except the white guys.  I obviously wasn't impressed by him.  Yeah, see? 
[01:20:30]  He didn't do it.  Didn't do it for him.  Jack Webb did it.  Yeah, Jack Webb.  Do you, uh, did you, do you ever have girls that want to, like, you know, just sleep with you because of how you were in that film?  No, I told you, they don't want a lock of my hair.  I never, I don't have a problem with that.  He just goes to the Philippines or somewhere.  It does trouble me.  I'd like to have that sometimes.  Oh, yes.  I think that, that could be fun once in a while, you know?  Do you know, if you came here, it's a studio, we would definitely have a girl for you. 
[01:21:00]  Well, oh, yeah.  I'd bring a relative if I had to.  Geez, guys.  You're going to have to come on live sometime.  Yeah, where are you right now?  We are having a great time, aren't we?  Yes.  Hell yes.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  You guys are all the way in New York City.  That's the problem.  New York City.  New York.  Where are you, where are you now?  I'd like to come to New York City just to make a damn statement, to tell you the truth.  Well, come on by.  You come on by.  We will hang with you.  Okay, you guys, you know, you've got my website. 
[01:21:30]  CharlieErmy.com, right?  Oh, yeah, I got it up there right now.  Have you ever looked it over?  Yes.  Have you read the, what I wrote about the war yet?  Yes, you have your State of the Union address, your solution to end hijacking.  Okay, come on.  Take shots at me on the solution to hijacking.  What's wrong with it?  It's a little weird with the Filipino chicks involved, but.  You can't do it without Filipino chicks. 
[01:22:00]  You like the no curbside check-in?  No curbside bag check-in, things like that?  You know, it doesn't matter to me.  I'm not bothered by that.  I just think it's, I don't think it's really necessary.  Yeah, right.  What's your solution?  Well, you know, I'll give you a brief synopsis of my solution.  Brief is not in this guy's vocabulary.  If somebody wants to really see what the solution is, they need to go to the website and read it, 
[01:22:30]  because I can't explain it as well as I can sit down and write it.  But what we need to do is, they're already fortifying the doors.  Absolutely.  And why don't they just move that wall back about three feet so that the starboard, that bulkhead back about three feet,  so that starboard head will be in the cockpit.  Yes.  I mean, what the hell is the use of having a damn door that's barred?  If you have to go outside into the cabin to take it, you know. 
[01:23:00]  A leak.  Yes.  So, you know, we need that head inside that, forward head inside that wall.  That's all.  A couple of feet.  Do you think that that head should be so clean, the Virgin Mary herself would be proud to go in there and take a dump?  I do believe it should be kept sparkling clean.  Sparkling?  So that one would be proud to eat off of the floor in that head.  Jeez.  Private Joker, why is this terrorist in my head?  Why aren't you putting his turban out? 
[01:23:30]  Anyway, that's one of the, part one of the solution, and part two is you must cut off all communications from the cabin to the cockpit.  Right.  Sure.  And that way, if there is no negotiations, if there is no contact, if the terrorists can't talk to the people operating the airplane,  how in the hell can he use it as a weapon?  How can he use it to even take him any damn place?  I like it.  So what's the use in even hijacking it in the first place? 
[01:24:00]  Might as well hijack a Greyhound bus, right?  And it's a surprise to the pilots when they land and open the door to see if everyone's dead or alive.  Well, you know, what they do is they go straight down to the ground.  The first, as soon as that red light comes on in the cockpit, that there's a problem back, a big problem.  Back and back, right away, the control tower says, flight number zero, zero, this is Denver.  I have you on radar.  Take a heading of such and such, such and such, and start your descent into Denver, into Denver Airport. 
[01:24:30]  Okay, control, I will, but you sure sound like that guy from Full Metal Jackets.  But it's fine, Paul.  I mean, come on.  Somebody says, well, what if there's a guy having a heart attack?  Right.  Well, he's going to receive medical help.  The thing is, as soon as the red light goes in the cockpit, the bells go off and ambulance are scrambled,  the fire trucks are scrambled, the law enforcement are scrambled,  to a runway that is way to hell and gone out someplace, where if the plane blows up, it's not going to blow up the terminal. 
[01:25:00]  See, he's thinking of the good of the video.  Now, the deal is, if you lose control of that airplane and the terrorist takes control of it,  the F-16s are going to blow you out of the sky anyway.  God damn.  So what do you think?  Little air support.  I like that.  So what do you think, what do you like about the Filipino chicks?  He said the flathead and the asses. 
[01:25:30]  I told you, the flathead.  That's about it, though, huh?  The butt that protrudes.  You've got to have a place to put your beer.  Hey, a lot of people are asking if you could give us one, what's your major malfunction?  Just one, a little taste.  What in the hell is your major malfunction, Private Opie?  Why aren't you over there fighting this war?  Because I'm a pussy, sir.  Toe jam, clip them.  You know, that's another thing.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  As soon as this situation started happening here, I volunteered to go back in uniform.  Now, you can just imagine me, 57 years old, out there on the battlefield.  That's not going to happen.  Yeah.  But I could at least go in uniform and go keep the troops motivated.  Keep them motivated.  Yeah, certainly do that.  You know, just travel around and motivate the troops.  That's what I do.  I motivate, so why not?  By the way, talking about motivate.  Uh-oh.  That brings me around to the world. 
[01:26:30]  Here's a guy who's got some great segues.  I have a doll.  I have an action figure.  I call it the 12-inch MF.  Yeah.  We talked about that a little earlier, sir.  This is amazing.  It looks like you.  It's provable.  You can put it in all kinds of poses, like, choke yourself.  You know, you could get the Ken doll, who's a pussy from Barbie, and you could have him choke himself on your hand.  Well, you know, the deal is, he is 12 inches tall, and he can play with Ken and Barbie. 
[01:27:00]  And who in the hell do you think down at Poolside would be in charge?  Ken would be doing push-ups all the time.  Ken would be a gopher.  And what the hell?  Oh, my.  I wouldn't even like to think what he might be doing with Barbie.  Are they going to come with different, like, uniform changes, like a little, um, shorts and skivvies, like a little set, like when you ran into the bathroom with the hat and your underwear?  Good night, ladies.  Exactly.  They are actually talking about some uniform changes.  Oh, that's great. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, have you heard the prank calls that are all over the Internet?  I haven't.  Aren't they disgusting?  You have heard them?  I've heard them.  My manager called me up the other day and played some for me.  I said, you know.  All right.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  We're not sitting there saying, that is really, you know, there are rude people in this world that are just so totally rude.  It's wrong.  Yeah.  You're talking to a few of them.  Damn it.  We love them.  Now, you're not that rude.  We love those things, man.  Yeah, but you love them, of course, but you're not doing them. 
[01:28:00]  No.  No.  No.  I mean, you wouldn't do them.  It takes a rude, nasty, evil individual to do things like that.  No, we don't do stuff like that, ever.  You know what would be fun?  I mean.  You could just call people up from your house and do them.  You're the kind of guys who, on Halloween, would light the bag of poop on fire.  Right.  On the doorstep, right?  And it's good, clean fun.  But that's just a good joke, yeah.  And occasionally, we like to egg a house.  Well, nothing wrong with egging a house.  Just for a laugh.  I mean, it comes off.  Right.  After two, three snows, you know, you'd never even know that house been egged. 
[01:28:30]  How did we get here?  I don't know.  All right.  We're going to let you go, sir.  You've got to get here to New York and come on our show.  Okay.  You know what I'm doing right now?  Sergeant Segway, go ahead.  What?  I'm sitting here with 400 Gunnery Sergeant Lee Ermey action figures in front of me signing  these boxes and sending them out to my friends, my buddies, the guys that buy them on the 
[01:29:00]  website.  Well, send us one, sir.  I thought we sent you one.  Well, you want the one that's signed.  Pardon me?  We want a signed one, sir.  Oh, you want a signed one?  Of course.  Oh, well, all right then.  We'll have a talk about that.  John Madden, what about your action figure?  Hey, my action figure, you pull a string and he doesn't say half as much as this guy.  I thought you were going to say you pull his finger.  That would have been a better line.  Maybe you'll be my writer, Sergeant.  You never know. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Sergeant, thank you so much.  Guys, it's been an absolute pleasure and I look forward to our next encounter.  You're the greatest man alive, sir.  Joust away, my friend.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Goodbye.  Semper Fi.  Semper Fi.  Oh, hoorah.  Nice.  Hoorah.  Isn't he great?  Oh, my God.  What a classic.  I thought he was going to pull a Buddy Epson a few times.  Can you guys explain what that is to the old Frankster?  Buddy Epson?  Yeah.  All right.  Get the Buddy Epson clip.  Yeah.  Now we've got to get the Buddy Epson clip. 
[01:30:00]  We love playing this for new people that have never heard this.  Now, we don't even have to explain.  We'll just play it.  Arlie Ermey is great.  I love it.  But you've got to understand, that movie, when did it come out?  86.  86.  A few more years have gone by.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  I'm not saying anything.  Guy's only 57 years old.  But there's just, he seems to wander a bit.  The action figure is the most, it doesn't make sense.  It says rated R, not for children.  Then it says, for children over three on it. 
[01:30:30]  And then it says ages 12 and up.  So what is, who's it, who's that for?  Who's that for?  I don't even know who it's for.  Is it a 12-year-old?  They'll put it in small parts.  Here's a guy who's not too sure about his body.  My dear sweet heaven.  All right.  So we had Buddy Epson on.  He's, I think he's 102 now.  Right.  He's still alive?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we asked him to sing the theme song of the Beverly Hills.  Unfortunately, he tried. 
[01:31:00]  We had no clue that that was going to confuse him.  And it made for a very awkward moment on this radio show.  You would think Uncle Jed would know the words to the song.  Everyone knows the words.  So when he was doing the first scene from Full Metal Jacket,  it looked like he was going to pull a Buddy Epson on it.  Right.  I got you.  Forget the dialogue and stuff.  But he made it through.  Perfect.  Here's the clip of Buddy Epson.  Listen to this, Frank.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Boer Mountaineer.  Barely kept his family fed. 
[01:31:30]  And then one day, oh, he never...  I'm still writing it.  I'm sorry.  Oh, God, that's brutal.  I'm sorry.  This goes right through.  Do we have time for the Well Doggies?  Do you have those up?  I don't know if I have mine.  Damn.  Which one is mine?  The first one?  Oh, my gosh. 
[01:32:00]  You got the first one?  All right.  I think I have the last one, right?  There's three, though.  I have the second one.  That's really bad.  Explain it to Frank as we set up the Well Doggies.  We had spoken with Buddy Epson.  We've known him for years.  Okay.  Since our Boston days.  Yeah.  And the first time he talked, and we had him do the, you know, Well Doggies, that whole  thing he used to do.  Yeah.  And he did it, and it sounded just like it did on the show.  It was perfect.  And then the two other times we've had him on, the second time it was getting bad. 
[01:32:30]  The third time, something happened to the man.  The degeneration of Jed Clampus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we got the normal one.  Do I have the first and the third?  This is the first and the third.  All right.  I got the first one.  This is when he was, honestly, I think he's like 90.  Oh, God.  We used to know all this.  He's creeping up.  This is when he was about 88 or so.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Or 90.  Well Doggies.  See?  That's good.  That's tasty.  A couple years went by, and we're like, hey, let's check in with Buddy Epson. 
[01:33:00]  And we asked him to do it, and here's what he said.  Well Doggies.  Now, we were thinking, perhaps he just had a cold that day.  Get some more air in the diaphragm.  We go from the nice, smooth Well Doggies to this one.  Well Doggies.  But perhaps he was sick that day.  And then another year went by, and I hope you're holding on to something here.  Well Doggies.  What happened? 
[01:33:30]  I was going to get to the point where he says, ah.  Where dogs are just tilting their heads with their ears up.  You don't hear a thing.  So, Frank, once again, this is about five, six years ago.  Well Doggies.  Nice.  Nice.  Right?  And here is the second time.  Well Doggies.  Ouch.  And only a few months ago.  Well Doggies.  It sounds like a track and trail of locking them up on a highway.  Doggies.  Doggies. 
[01:34:00]  Doggies.  All right.  We've got to play a Sergeant Hartman crank call.  Oh, do we have a, oh, we've got one more, um, Buddy Epson?  Doggies.  Doggies.  All right.  Here's the 7-Eleven prank.  Using clips from Full Metal Jacket.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  My name is Jeet.  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty? 
[01:34:30]  Ah.  Do you suck...  What?  Do you suck...  Yeah.  Bull, I bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hole.  Terry, my ritual, brother.  Talk to like on the phone, man.  What you doing, man?  You don't scare me.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  Raj.  Well, no...  Oh, come on, sir.  Talk to like a little seriously.  Hello?  Hello?  Don't you un-f*** yourself, or I will un-stool your head and c*** on your neck. 
[01:35:00]  Aye, aye, aye, aye.  What the...  Do you think I'm cute?  Do you think I'm funny?  Who?  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and c*** my sister.  C*** your sister.  What, you little maggot?  You make me want to move it.  Thanks, sir.  Ah!  Are you about to call me an a*****?  Who are you?  Gorma Pyle.  Huh?  Gorma Pyle.  I don't understand.  Who are you?  Gorma Pyle.  Huh?  Who are you?  No a*****.  I'm not a a*****.  Who are you?  You at least un-f*** yourself, or I will un-stool your head and c*** on your neck. 
[01:35:30]  Anytime, okay?  Come on, let's go.  Ah!  One, two, three...  Spike!  Ray Rack Radio.  Like a bunch of people cheering on a race.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Oh, these scum and some eggs.  Slime.  The Opian Anthony Show.  Ah, Sam Adams.  Yes, an American beer.  That's right, Sam Adams, the popular choice.  The, uh, playoff games, right? 
[01:36:00]  How about that?  You kick back with your pals, and you're drinking some icy cold.  Sam Adams, rooting for your favorite team.  Seattle four, Cleveland zero, in the fourth.  There you go.  See?  Now pop open an ice cold Sam Adams, a true American beer.  That's right.  We drink it here.  We love it.  Sam Adams.  Isn't our fridge just packed with icy cold Sam Adams?  Then why don't I have one?  Sam Adams.  Trade up.  That's what you gotta do.  Trade up to a better beer. 
[01:36:30]  A true American beer.  Tastes great.  We love it here.  All the Sam Adams products.  Uh, the lager.  Even the Summer Ale, you can still find it on the shelf.  Mm-mm.  Sam Adams.  1027.  WNEW.  This is the Opian Anthony Show.  Hello.  Sergeant Hartman.  That was something.  That was cool.  He got us all yelling.  Sir, yes, sir.  Did you see you hear that?  We're like, we couldn't get it. 
[01:37:00]  We didn't get it out.  Just like, uh, his, uh, his recruits.  We didn't give it to him good enough the first time.  And he had to say, sound off like you got a pair.  Pronunciations I like, too.  Vietnam.  Vietnam.  Osama.  Osama.  Osama.  Bin Laden.  Bin Laden.  If you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Sacramento.  Yes.  Give them a little push today.  They're very motivated about the Opian Anthony Show.  So, highly motivated. 
[01:37:30]  We're on KXOA.  Kid Chris.  Kid Chris's radio station, I believe.  866-277-4WOW.  In the studio, Frank Caliendo.  For the New York area, uh, area, area listeners.  Frank's going to be at Bananas.  Uh, in Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie on Friday.  And, uh, Hasbrook Heights Bananas on Saturday.  Saturday.  I hate when they throw you guys at two different locations.  It confuses everyone.  Well, the owners are here, so I love it. 
[01:38:00]  Ah.  In the next room, so I enjoy that.  We want to get, uh, you know, people in the seats, so.  You can do it any time you want to.  Put me anywhere you want, just pay me.  Thank you, Brian Regan.  Sorry.  Frank Caliendo.  Bananas Friday in Poughkeepsie.  And then, uh, the Bananas in Hasbrook Heights on Saturday.  Very funny guy.  He's on MADtv, Anthony.  Yes.  Did you hear, uh, Bananas, uh, motto?  Do you know what Bananas' whole motto is about their place?  Don't split?  No, I think, uh...  I think, uh...  Dear sweet heaven, why did I say that? 
[01:38:30]  I think Sergeant Hartman has it, I believe.  There is no racial bigotry here.  I do not look down on niggers, kites, wops, or greasers.  That's a great credo to have.  Here's a guy who knows how to use the language.  He's a real painter with that, uh, with the English.  That's motivating.  Come listen to a story, by the man.  I'm sorry.  I love the part, and then there's, uh...  Boom!  There's that thing, and it didn't happen, and I can't remember. 
[01:39:00]  There's the old guy apologizing, like he just wet himself, and you had to change him.  You know, I'm sorry.  You know, I can't even, I can't even fake it.  Most people cringe when they hear something like that.  It just makes me laugh really, really hard.  Beautiful.  Dude, did Madden ever hear you do him?  Yeah, I think he's, uh, okay.  From what I've heard is he's okay with the impression,  but with the, when, like, did the Kimmel stuff,  when they, like, cut off my eyebrows and stuff with the edge clippers,  he wasn't...  Yeah, hey, uh, the guy is, uh, he does a great voice, 
[01:39:30]  but, uh, when you, when you try to, you know, uh, when you, and then, uh, I'm sorry.  And then, uh, and then, uh, and then when you, what you're trying to do,  is, uh, bananas in Poughkeepsie on Friday,  and then Saturday in Hasbro,  here's a guy who can really, uh, Norton it.  And then when you can, sometimes, you can tell,  and then when, I can't, and manicuring, and then it's, uh, hey!  He didn't like it? 
[01:40:00]  He, uh, I guess he's okay with the voice and stuff,  but when they, like, clip...  He doesn't understand.  He does have big, bushy eyebrows.  Yeah, but, you know, and then the other things we did with him  weren't the most beautiful things on Earth either.  The first one I did with Kimmel was he,  I had, like, a barbecue sauce all over my face  because we were eating barbecued wings.  They're like, hey, Jeremy, nice hat!  And it's just like, ah, hey, hey, I can't remember where my mouth is!  He didn't like that either.  Yeah, so, but they want me to do Madden sketches on Best Damn Sports Show,  that thing, they've called me about that, that, uh, 
[01:40:30]  the, uh, Tom Arnold vehicle.  Oof.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Stay away.  Dakota Matata!  Stay away.  He used to be so hot, too.  What happened to Tom Arnold?  Oh.  He's, uh...  He's not going to say anything.  I know.  Yeah, what do you want me to do?  This is like when I was in here the first time,  and you guys were trying to get me to say bad things about everybody.  What do you hate about Robin Williams?  I want to work with him.  Leave me alone.  And Oofy's like getting to be like, you know,  yeah, you want to work with him?  Cheaper piece of crap.  I'm doing it, man.  What do you hate about, man? 
[01:41:00]  Hey, if I said that, I wouldn't get to do it anymore.  Right.  Just, it says you guys don't want me to work anywhere else,  so I can only do your show.  Right!  That's what it is.  That's kind of like, uh, what we do here.  I do have a problem, though.  I, I, I don't think you're on Mad TV.  Why is that?  You're not on the website.  Well.  Yeah, I don't understand that.  I don't know.  They have everyone else from Mad TV on the Mad TV website.  They don't have our buddy Frank Caliendo on there.  I'm not on there.  MadTV.com?  No.  Are you on the opening credits? 
[01:41:30]  I think.  As of right now.  Maybe after today.  Maybe not anymore.  No, they, I don't know why,  I don't know why they don't update that.  I just get,  every time I go on the radio,  I gotta go say,  I go say,  go to FrankCaliendo.com  because I want people to see who I am.  Yeah.  And see my picture.  And then they, you know,  I'm promoting the show,  so I say,  Frank Caliendo from Mad TV  and sell myself out like that.  Yeah.  But then if I say,  go to MadTV.com,  there's no me.  And then people don't believe.  What a gimmick you got.  You, you just,  I was gonna show there.  Hey, it's Norton from NYPD Blue. 
[01:42:00]  See, it doesn't matter.  As long as you say it,  it's true.  Yeah, and Brian Regan  was gonna be in the studio today.  Gotta believe everything.  Can't believe everything you hear.  Well, yeah,  Brian was supposed to come in today.  Can you find out  what they're doing in Cleveland today?  I know what it is.  No, it's in commercials.  All right.  All right, good.  Okay.  Sorry.  See, we have to handle our affiliates.  I'm really glad  that you're paying that much attention to me  that you're looking at the computer screen  and going,  I want to make sure  that Cleveland gets to hear 
[01:42:30]  our friend Frank Caliendo.  Let's just put it that way, okay?  What happened?  I got it.  They said it's okay.  Oh, okay.  So we'll keep the bitchin'  to stuff that is happening.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  I forgot what we were talking about.  Oh, the website.  Yeah, I don't know why.  I just don't understand that.  I just wish they'd put me on there  because, you know,  you saw me on the show  unless I just got,  I had a special satellite feed  that went to you in New Hampshire  just so you could see it.  Yeah, that was it.  I was telling them  I saw the Robin Williams sketch  when I was up in New Hampshire 
[01:43:00]  laying my ass on it.  And that was the one  you guys never really wanted me to do.  You guys were like,  oh, Robin Williams.  Why?  And I was like,  I do the serious Robin Williams.  Let's have some fun.  Let's enjoy ourselves.  I'll bite my lip.  Okay, that was a visual joke.  Here's a guy who should have done that.  That was Robin Williams doing Madden.  Not very well.  But that's okay.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The end.  Here's a guy who's got to get an end of bits.  If he doesn't have an end of bits,  then you guys just stare at me. 
[01:43:30]  No, you know,  I think the impression was perfect.  It was perfect because  it wasn't funny,  just like Robin Williams.  Dear sweet Lord,  I got caught in a web.  Hey, we got to check in with Blind Dave.  Oh, my God.  Now, this is unbelievable.  I think you might have pulled it off.  Blind Dave.  Hey, guys.  Hold on, hold on.  I got to set this up.  So you called us about an hour ago  and said you were about to embark on a mission.  Yes.  I want to make it perfectly clear.  You are completely blind at this point, right? 
[01:44:00]  Just about.  Just about.  You can see what?  Slight shadows?  Yep, shadows and shapes and whatnot.  But you really...  I can see light.  Yeah, but if Ant and I were in front of you,  you would have no idea who it was, right?  No.  Okay.  Why don't you tell everyone your mission today?  My mission was to go with my partner in crime here  and renew my driver's license.  And I am holding in my hand 
[01:44:30]  my brand-new driver's license,  a valid driver's license.  Jesus, that's great.  He just got this license.  And I put a back brace on  and used like a cane, like a cripple cane,  and I held on to my friend  like she was my girlfriend  and told him I had broken ribs.  I was just in a car accident  and my glasses were smashed.  Yeah.  And it was pretty scary, man. 
[01:45:00]  So walk us through it, though.  What do they have you do with all that?  My friend can probably walk you through it better.  Hold on.  All right.  Hey, how are you?  Hi, who are you?  How are you?  My name's Dan.  I'm Dave's friend.  Oh, cool.  Dave's a great guy.  Yeah, he's pretty cool.  Pretty crazy, too.  Now, how the hell did you do this?  It was...  It was...  Wheel-doggy.  Hi.  Hi. 
[01:45:30]  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  So, we finally...  I walked all the way in with him.  We went through the maze, got up to the front of the line, and then I walked up with  him, and the only problem that we had is when they told him to sign, and he's like,  oh, I don't have my glasses, and so I told him, like, where to sign. 
[01:46:00]  Wait, wait.  He had to sign a form.  He had to sign his name.  His name.  Just his signature.  Right.  But he had to sign twice.  We should have videotaped this.  This could have been on Fox News all over the country.  So, he walks up and goes through...  EMB workers, are they paying attention?  So, he had to sign his name.  No, they are not.  He had to sign his name, and you had to point where he had to sign.  I put his hand...  I put the pen in his hand, and then put the pen down where he should sign it. 
[01:46:30]  That's cool.  And the first time, he did okay.  It was decent.  The second time, they had us also, rather than sit down, and like, oh, you poor thing,  why don't you just go get your picture taken right now?  And so, he's like, oh, yeah, my back.  I'm in pain.  I can't walk.  And he's like, can she come with me?  And she's like, yeah, she can help you over there.  Was he looking at the lady when he was supposed to and all that?  Yeah, I think so.  Because his eyes go kind of crazy.  Then, he was...  Yeah, I mean, I don't even know.  I didn't look at you when you were actually signing. 
[01:47:00]  But he was looking at her like when...  Yeah, he was shaking, by the way, too.  And he's like, oh, man, my medication.  And I'm like, yeah.  I'll tell him when the little group got together.  Oh, I was getting to that.  So, then we actually go and get the picture taken, but he has to sign again.  So, then I like put his hand down to sign it.  And he's like, oh, she's got to help me sign.  I'm like, okay.  I'm like, sign right here.  And he starts like going higher.  He signed like out of, not even just over the line, but out of the entire box where he 
[01:47:30]  was supposed to sign.  He like started signing his first name like inside the box and then was going up.  It was completely outside the box.  I'm like, they're not even going to let him get away with that.  Right.  And I thought for sure we were busted.  So, then they're like, okay, back up and take your picture.  So, he backs up against the wall.  And then they like, they take the picture and it all goes fine.  And then we're waiting.  We just step back and waited by the wall, like rather than going back to the seating.  And suddenly, they all start like confining together and start talking. 
[01:48:00]  And I'm like, oh, no.  They're talking about you.  In trouble now.  Yeah, there was like four of them.  And then the manager came over and they all start talking.  I'm like, oh, no.  We're in trouble.  And then they just like broke up.  And then a minute later, they're like, Dave, here's your license.  I walked up and grabbed it and started laughing.  You didn't have to read a chart or anything.  No, there was no eye test at all.  Why is there no eye test?  I don't know. 
[01:48:30]  There isn't an eye test.  You only take it the first time.  So, once again, in the great state of Connecticut.  I can't divulge the state, but you only take it the first time you apply for a driver's license.  And after that, all you have to do is bring in your driver's license, sign the form, and get your picture done.  And just hand over the money.  Make sure to sign inside the box next time.  That's all I'm going to say.  If you sign outside the box, it's not a good thing.  They might figure out that you're blind.  Don't do that. 
[01:49:00]  Please.  Sign inside.  I'm trying to talk here.  Don't talk.  Okay.  Hold on.  I'm the sergeant now.  Sergeant Segway.  Bananas and Poughkeepsie on fire.  Yeah.  Uh, Mr. Pacino, you played a blind man.  Yes.  Incentive a woman.  I lived it for a while.  Yeah.  So, uh, what do you think about a blind guy getting a license?  I think that that's ridiculous.  I think that's insane.  What do you think, Brian?  Oh, that's okay.  Not a problem.  You know, there's a lot of blind people on the road today. 
[01:49:30]  A lot of blind people driving around.  I got cut off on my way in here by a guy driving a log bus.  Got a bunch of logs and he dropped them.  Must have been a blind guy without a lot of power when he hooked up the ropes to keep the logs in the van.  Not even a van.  It's a truck.  Maybe I should have remembered what it was.  Brian Higgins got nothing bad to say about anybody.  So, Brian, you think it's fine.  It's okay.  Not a problem.  Yeah.  Not a problem to be a blind man on the road.  I can't. 
[01:50:00]  Hey, Blind Dave?  Hey, he sounds pretty good doing that.  I like his John Matting a little better there.  Well, that's coming from a guy with a heightened sense of hearing.  That's not a guy with normal hearing.  That's a guy who could probably hear a dog whistle because he can't see.  But he can drive, so who knows?  I don't know.  Well, I do believe him.  I believe everything.  Dave.  I just want to let everyone know that I have no intention of getting behind the wheel of a car.  I just want this for ID purposes.  Here's a guy who doesn't want the cops to get him now. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  Great thinking.  If you cover it up, boom, you're not going to have a problem.  Dave, I mean, you had to, like, stand on that spot to get your picture taken.  Yeah, I had to stand there.  Did your friend whisper and say, okay, about four steps, turn around?  Well, she was kind of standing right with me there a little bit, and then she just kind of backed away.  And then I said, look at the light, and then I looked at the light, and they said, no, over this way a little bit.  And I said, okay.  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:00]  Excuse me.  Not blind guy, could you move a little to the left?  Move a little to the left to the big spot.  Move.  Okay.  I can picture it, too.  I know that his friend was just guiding him around like he's a blind guy.  But nobody in the place is going, there's no way a blind guy is going to try to get his license, so it's got to be on the up and up.  Hey, could you move your dog to the side?  Move your dog to the side.  Why do you got a dog there?  I used a regular cane, you know, so that I could bump a few things with it. 
[01:51:30]  Like you were hurt, like it was a leg injury or back injury cane, but then you're sweeping it across the floor looking for obstacles.  No, I held on around her waist, so it looked like she was helping hold me up because of my injury from my car accident where my glasses had been smacked.  We've seen you many times.  You don't walk around smoothly.  You're very...  You see me drunk out of my mind, dude.  Were you drunk, too?  Dude, I accidentally signed myself into a nuthouse unknowingly. 
[01:52:00]  Sign inside the box.  I went to go into a detox, right?  Yeah.  And this woman tells my parents, well, can I have a moment alone with them?  And she told me to sign this stuff, and I said, well, if I want to just walk out of there, I could just walk out of there, right?  And she said, yeah.  And then this guy starts telling me, I think you're full of crap.  I don't think you're blind.  And I think you're displaying violent behavior. 
[01:52:30]  I was in a nuthouse with people who talked to themselves.  You signed yourself.  I antagonized the crazy guy who talked to themselves, and they thought I was, you know, kind of dangerous for doing that.  And they almost, they weren't going to let me out.  And because I displayed violent behavior, because I was like, no one told me I'm in a nuthouse.  Like, these people are nuts.  I'm an alky.  I'm not a nut.  You know, I'm nuts, but not, you know.  Well, no, not like crazy nuts. 
[01:53:00]  Well, Dave, that's an amazing story.  You told us about a month or two ago that you were going to try to get it renewed, and you did it, my friend.  I can't believe it.  Why the guy gets his license renewed today on the Opie and Anthony show.  And without the alcohol, it was like I was so nervous.  You know, if ever a day I wanted to have a drink before doing something, today was a day.  Was the lady looking in your eyes?  I mean, how does he know?  I don't know.  I know, but what did your friend say?  She had no clue? 
[01:53:30]  She couldn't say much to me because it would have looked obvious, you know.  Wow.  All right.  Do you still drink?  Do you still drink?  I haven't.  I've been sober for like a couple of weeks now.  I'm not drinking ever again.  I'm done.  Good for you.  All right.  Dave, we got to go.  All right.  Congratulations.  Thanks for the story.  All right.  Hey, and I'm moving to Boston.  So when you guys are up there, man, maybe I can check you out when you come up there.  Yeah, we'll see you there.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I'll grab him first. 
[01:54:00]  Blind Dave on the Rocko Show.  All right, Dave.  All right.  Later, guys.  Thanks a lot.  We'll see you in Boston.  All right.  Hey, Brian Riggins calling in.  We got to take a quick break and we'll talk to him next.  He was supposed to be.  What?  Oh, you're going to kill Ben.  Ben is going to have your ass.  Brian.  Hi, Brian.  Hey.  Uh-oh.  Where are you?  I'm in a hotel room in Queens.  In Queens. 
[01:54:30]  Did you hear something interesting?  Did you hear something that maybe didn't sound right?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's Frank Caliendo.  It's Frank.  Hey, it's me.  How are you, man?  I'm doing all right, dude.  How are you doing?  I'm doing good.  You've never said dude in your life.  I actually have a bit of a cold.  Uh-oh.  I don't know if that's coming through or not.  A little bit.  We can hear it.  Do you have that tummy ache?  Oh, no.  I'm just like, I'm just hacking, man. 
[01:55:00]  Okay, you go ahead.  I flew in last night.  I mean, I took the red eye, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, coughing and not being able to stop, you know, is bad enough, but when  you sit on a plane next to somebody, you've got to break the news to them, you know?  Hi, how are you?  I'm going to be your seatmate, and I'm hacking up a lung and won't be stopping for six hours 
[01:55:30]  straight.  And I'm not sure that it's not anthrax.  Yeah, it could be the anthrax, I guess.  Yeah, who knows?  If any spores, you know, happen upon your tabletop.  Don't breathe them.  I wouldn't breathe them in.  Brian, has it gone into your head that maybe the anthrax thing and you're sick, have you  thought about that?  I'm not wise enough to make connections like that.  I just cough for a week straight and hope everything's going to be okay.  That's it.  I like the way you think. 
[01:56:00]  Now, Brian, we've been talking about, you know, every time you're on, you never have  a bad thing to say about anybody.  Yeah, well, I've switched my tune.  Ah, it's a bad time.  Now, who do you have something bad to say about?  This is not the real Brian Regan.  He would never say something bad.  I've been laden.  What's with my postman?  He's brought the mail late by about 20 minutes.  Speaking of writing a letter to the post office. 
[01:56:30]  You've got to start acting, doing your act blue.  Oh, he's a scumbag.  Well, I wouldn't go that far.  That darned loser.  I think bin Laden deserves a lot of credit.  He lives in a cave.  Oh, man.  Six foot five.  Looks like he keeps himself in shape.  He's a good guy.  He's strapping.  Strapping.  That one, I'm so afraid of even touching.  Ah, really?  That's okay.  You don't have to be here to do it. 
[01:57:00]  Here's a guy who's going to have Brian Regan hating him.  So, you couldn't make it in.  Is it the sickness, or is it that you don't want to come in?  No, it's this, man.  I got in at like 8.30 this morning.  I had to rack out.  I'm sick, man.  Yeah.  That sucks.  You got a show, what, tomorrow?  I've got a show tonight.  Tonight?  And tomorrow night at Governor's.  Right.  Oh, get the sick Brian Regan. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So, it's like half the jokes, and like the other half is coughing.  Excuse me while I sniffle.  Yeah.  Hey, you ever notice?  Hang on.  How come when you're driving?  Hang on.  I'm going to cough on the right side of the stage.  I'm on the left side of the stage, and I'm coughing.  I've coughed on the entire audience.  Hey, you're going to cough on people's wings and whatnot. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  You got to bring out your Gallagher tarps.  Keep the slam off.  Hey, Frank is a funny man.  Yeah, we liked Frank.  We were hoping you were going to come in to join the party today, Brian.  There's a tape he has that I saw at a club out in Los Angeles, and I laughed myself silly.  Oh, well, thank you very much.  Everything you've ever done.  Let's ask you some time, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everything you've ever done.  It's always great.  You can tell when somebody is awesome when you can, like, do an impression of them. 
[01:58:30]  And if they're funny to start with, and you're one of those guys that I think, there's, like,  a few guys in this business who can just be completely copied, like David Tell is one,  Brian Regan.  People, you know, if you can get their cases.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Not everyone.  Okay.  You never see two comics kissing each other's ass.  I know.  It's very strange.  It's very odd.  Call the National Enquirer.  Two comedians getting along.  But I appreciate that.  That's a little answer.  I appreciate that.  You guys have no idea how much.  That's a little answer.  Call the National Enquirer. 
[01:59:00]  Ring.  Ring.  But then again, I wouldn't slam Hitler.  Right.  You're the guy that wouldn't say anything bad about Hitler.  Who'd want to.  It doesn't mean anything if Brian Regan says you're good.  Oh, yeah.  You're excellent.  You're a snappy dresser.  I enjoyed your clip because of the editing.  I'm not editing.  I'm not sure how good you are.  But zip zap, you get a little couple things together.  Suddenly, you got a lot of funny.  That was really good, man.  Thank you. 
[01:59:30]  I appreciate it.  All right.  Well, Brian, we'd love to have you in here sometime.  Oh, absolutely.  You know, when you come back and you're not dying of anthrax, come on in.  Wearing nurses masks so you don't spread anything.  I'm sorry.  I couldn't get in there this time, guys.  I miss you guys.  I'll see you soon.  Thanks, Brian.  That sounds good.  Thank you.  Hey, good luck in Medford tonight.  All right.  Sounds like you're going to need it.  What are you going to do?  The NyQuil?  I've got Vicks 44D.  I'm sucking on tea with lemon. 
[02:00:00]  And everybody's got a remedy.  You tell somebody you got a cold.  Yeah.  You've got to put peanut butter on Red's tips.  And you crack them in half and you put them in soup.  I put the Vicks in my tea.  Everybody's got their own way.  You know what works, man?  Dude, if you're not feeling well and you've got to call if you're 69 with a Haitian.  See, that one I haven't heard.  Damn noise.  Wow.  I'll try that one for tomorrow's show.  Yeah.  And tomorrow night, the governor's in Levittown. 
[02:00:30]  Then I bet you'll feel much better tomorrow.  I hope so.  All right, Brian.  We'll let you go get some shut-eye.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  There's our buddy.  Under the weather, Brian Regan.  There goes Brian.  Dude, he is one of the funniest human beings ever.  Yeah.  He's better than that.  Let me tell you something.  He will still kill tonight in Medford.  Guaranteed.  He doesn't do well.  He doesn't curse at all.  What are you doing?  What are you...  Oh.  He's totally clean and comics like him. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Now, him and Cosby are the only two that can be totally clean and have comics enjoy them.  All right.  And one of them is a racist.  That's true.  Regan had the old, that's my mama, yanked off the shelf.  All right.  Frank Caliendo in studio.  He's playing Bananas tomorrow night.  See, there's no conflict there.  No.  No.  Because Brian's playing tonight.  He's on it.  You're playing tomorrow.  We're in totally different areas. 
[02:01:30]  I'll gladly give up my spot for Frank.  I enjoyed him so much.  In fact, I'm just canceling.  I'm not going to perform.  No.  Frank, real funny guy.  He's going to be at Bananas in Poughkeepsie tomorrow night and Saturday at the Bananas  in Hasbrook Heights.  And he's hanging with us, but I just wanted to get a plug in for you there.  I enjoy the plug.  And we have noticed he is on the Mad TV.  Yeah, I'm on Mad TV.  You guys must have done something.  It must have not have been refreshed before.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Guy's got some power.  Here's a guy who wasn't on it in the morning, but for Opie and Anthony, now he's on it. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, I like that.  Uh, I need a million dollars.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail for the kings of the radio.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Love it.  Oh, yeah.  You've got to love the hatch pipe.  These guys are the best.  See, I'm trying to find something to say, and I wasn't exactly sure how to go with it. 
[02:02:30]  That's all right, Pacino.  I didn't know you were into the hatch pipe.  That's okay.  You're a little messed up on the hatch.  Yeah, it doesn't let me see straight.  I could probably get a driver's license at this point.  Who knew?  Don't let that think that that's condoning smoking a hatch pipe,  because you can't be a blind person getting a gonorrhea.  What do you mean?  Thank you, John.  Very well said.  I had no idea what was going on.  Adam Sandler here, too. 
[02:03:00]  Why not?  We are all in the studio today.  I wish I could have talked to Mr. Regan, a hilarious guy.  I enjoyed him so much.  I wanted to hear him on sick.  I hate to hear any of my favorite people when they are not feeling well.  And that wasn't time.  Speaking of hatch pipes, whoa, I got a new movie coming out about hatch pipes.  You do?  No, I don't.  But I was looking for a segue.  That was a good segue.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:03:30]  A couple phone numbers if you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  I got my hash pipe, she got the way to groove it, share it.  I finally heard a new song.  You didn't know Neil Diamond was going to be here?  I did not know.  That's more of a Neil.  Reckon Rosa, get on board with my hash pipe.  Neil Diamond. 
[02:04:00]  I got my hash pipe.  Diamond.  Neil Diamond.  With genuine Diamond and full pearls.  Oh, my dear sweet heaven.  Hey, Jim, you're next on the show.  What's up today?  Diamond.  Jimmy.  Yeah, you guys hear about the planes, right?  The planes, man.  It's the planes.  The planes have this sky writing that stays in the air.  It's not real.  It's different stuff.  It's antibiotics. 
[02:04:30]  It can't any chemicals come here.  Speaking of hash pipes.  I'm trying to piece this together like a jigsaw puzzle.  The sky writing is not real?  No, it's not like a regular message or whatever.  Here it is.  It's a straight line.  There's a sky writing.  In the air.  And they stay in the air.  And they're antibiotics.  Antibiotics.  And the U.S. is doing it.  From them.  In case any bad chemicals come here from, you know, God forbid and bombs and stuff. 
[02:05:00]  So his sky writer is writing some stuff, but he's just making a line.  And it's not smoke.  It's antibiotics to rain down on the populace.  And they're just randomly making these lines all over the country, right?  If you look up at any day, any state you're in, any of your listening area, I'm sure that people will tell you this is true.  No, they won't.  Anybody look up right now.  You'll see out the window.  You'll see there's two.  They go in pairs usually, but sometimes there's only one, but he does a lot of zigzags. 
[02:05:30]  Jim, drug of choice?  What?  What do you like?  What do you like?  I like weed, just plain, regular weed.  Weed.  Yeah, this is a weed conversation.  Maybe they're dropping baby powder so our bottoms don't get red and sore.  Isn't it great, the hysteria?  I'm just telling you, it's true, and anybody will tell you this.  Otherwise, why are they sky writers?  Just to make lines.  All right.  Well, thank you for that one, Jim.  I remember the first time I got stoned, a similar thing. 
[02:06:00]  I actually thought I saw Nikita Khrushchev walking down the street, ready to shoot my family.  So, I understand what the weed will do to you.  The sky writers.  The missing character from Half-Baked.  Hey, buddy.  Time for some weed.  People think I'd smoke pot because of my eyes.  I don't smoke pot.  I don't remember how that turned out.  I like that, though.  Jackie.  We got some more hysteria.  Jackie, what's up? 
[02:06:30]  What's up, Jim?  Okay.  Listen, I was just reading my email, and possibly a hoax, but I'm not sure.  I thought I'd run it by you first.  Hold on.  You guys are usually good with this stuff.  All right, Jackie, hold on.  Were there 8,000 other email addresses attached to it?  Pretty much.  I love that.  It's got to be real.  I got it in an email.  Well, I'm not saying that, but you never know.  Don't blink your high beams to people that have their lights off coming at you, because  they turn around, chase you, and kill you, and get inducted into the gang.  Right.  See, Norton knows.  I got it in an email. 
[02:07:00]  All right, Jackie, what did you get?  The one about walking out of your house naked, because that one's going around to show support.  I swear to God.  What time are you supposed to walk out naked every night, 10 o'clock at night?  I forget.  Walk out of your house naked.  Someone will back me up, man.  This email's going around like crazy.  I haven't heard that one.  I think every night at 10, you're supposed to walk out of your house naked to show the  support for the U.S.  All right.  Yeah.  I sent that email.  You got it.  I sent it.  Jackie, so what's the latest one?  Okay.  So, basically, it says that this, my friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up 
[02:07:30]  until a month ago.  All right.  Let's slow down with the friend's friend stuff.  There's another one.  That's urban legend talk.  Of course.  It's always a friend.  Urban legend, a friend's friend.  And it says that she had a date with him around September 6th and was stood up.  Of course.  She was understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.  On 9-10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he could tell her  why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that.  The part worth mentioning is that he begged her not to go on any commercial airlines on 
[02:08:00]  9-11 and not to go to any malls on Halloween.  Oh.  And it's saying that as soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI  and has since turned over the letter.  So, that's basically it.  I just wanted to know if you guys had heard about this yet.  You know what?  I mean, that's scary crap.  It's urban legend stuff.  Everyone's getting a little shaky.  I do have a U.S. Department of Justice FBI thing that just came out.  Oh, yeah?  For immediate relief.  Certain information, while not specific as to target, gives the government reason to believe 
[02:08:30]  that there may be an additional terrorist attack within the United States and against  U.S. interests overseas over the next several days, the FBI has again alerted all local law  enforcement to be on the highest alert, and we call on all the people to immediately notify  the FBI and local law enforcement of any unusual or suspicious activity.  And that comes from FBI.gov.  Great.  But, you know, suspicious activity.  Did you hear about the one email that was going around to show solidarity that women  should come out and drink out of Jim Norton's mule? 
[02:09:00]  Is that it?  I haven't gotten that one yet.  Yeah, you hucked.  Jackie, that's someone just spreading some hysteria there.  Yeah.  I figured that.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Halloween.  There are some sick Fs out there that have decided to have fun with this whole thing.  Yeah.  You know, speaking of Halloween, Osama bin Laden masks amongst the most popular.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Who is going to, yeah.  Who the hell is going to trick or treat?  I would just punch him in the head. 
[02:09:30]  No, I would, you know, someone comes to your door and Osama bin Laden masks, shoot him  in the head.  But maybe, and then claim, whoa, I didn't know.  He was coming to my door.  Or better, I'll try and collect the reward.  We haven't found him yet in Afghanistan.  I figured he was smart enough to come hang out in America because no one's looking for him  here.  I shot him.  Try and collect the reward, then.  You're stupid enough to wear one of those.  You deserve what's coming to you.  Maybe people are doing something to him, though.  Like, you know.  No, no, no.  Ripping them apart.  No, no.  They're just wearing them. 
[02:10:00]  No, it's the bottom feeders in our society.  Yeah.  You know?  Free commerce.  Woo-hoo.  That means bottom feeders as well.  Has anybody else noticed that he looks like the boss from Fletch, too?  The boss?  Oh, Fletch's boss.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Very good.  Good reference.  Fletch.  Very good.  And he has DSLs.  The other email that's going around is you shave off a son of Bin Laden's beard and take  the turban off, and he looks just like O.J. Simpson.  That one's great.  Oh, stop it. 
[02:10:30]  O.J. Simpson's head is so big, they had to pan to get the whole thing out.  No, no, no.  I didn't do nothing.  But that email's going around like crazy as well.  Now I'm really pissed.  I'm a non-believer.  Yeah.  Let's go to Andy.  Andy.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, I'm looking at these lines that this guy called a minute ago or so was talking  about.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It looks like they're like regular skywriting planes, and there's just lines of smoke.  Lines of smoke. 
[02:11:00]  They're not writing anything.  It's just, I mean, it's not...  You explain how that's going to help us.  All right.  You got me.  I'm just reporting that I saw it.  All right.  Thank you.  That is not true.  Another guy, though.  Mark, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  I'm even 45 minutes from New York City up in Orange County, and I see the same thing.  When the guy said I see two lines and a couple of skywriting planes, it looks like.  Maybe it's an equal sign.  We're all equal.  How come everyone assumes it's antibiotic planes and not germ warfare planes? 
[02:11:30]  No, I'm not saying what it is.  I'm just saying that's what I see.  So I'm as cynical as Anthony is, and he's probably the most cynical person in the world.  Maybe they're just writing L's.  The double L.  It's the Spanish.  It's just tracers, right?  I don't know what it is.  It's a plane with some exhaust coming off of it.  Thank you, Mark.  All right, thanks a lot.  We're going to check in with Philadelphia.  The lovely and talented Melissa's on the line.  We love Melissa.  Melissa, please tell us that you're handing out free tickets. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God.  I just pulled up to Pat Stakes, the world-renowned Pat Stakes.  I just made an announcement about a half an hour ago that I felt like coming down here  to see if there were any ONA fans.  Like, 300 people showed up.  What do you guys have to say?  I don't know.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Can you believe us?  Oh, my God.  It's so awesome.  You guys, we got tickets for all of you.  Look at that. 
[02:12:30]  I don't hear a broad in the crowd.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Well, there you have it, guys.  You're pretty popular in Philly.  And they're sending me to Adult World next.  Adult World?  I've got to go to Adult World.  And give those people some tickets, too.  Yeah, you got the tickets for our day in Philly, basically, and the road show at the electric  factory.  Exactly.  It's about time that Tim, you know, hands over some of those tickets to you so he can  give them away.  Oh, God. 
[02:13:00]  He gave me a stack, but there's too many people here.  What am I going to do?  And I have to go back and get more.  Cool.  Hey, Melissa, at Adult World, does somebody put their mouth by a glory hole and a ticket  get stuck through the hole into the mouth?  I'm a little scared to go there, so I'll give you a report afterwards and let you know  what happened.  They must love you in Philly to make you do that today, man.  I know.  All right.  Thank you, Melissa.  Oh, man.  Just wanted to let you guys know they're getting psyched for your show.  Yeah.  Say bye to O&A, guys.  All right.  Wow. 
[02:13:30]  We can't wait.  Whoa!  Wait till that crowd marches into the Warsaw Ghetto.  Wearing their brown shirts.  We're going to Philly next Wednesday for the whole day, doing the radio show, and then  we're doing a road show at the electric factory.  Yeah, I was driving through Chicago the other day, and I heard you guys talking about it.  We're on in the middle of the night.  You heard us?  Yeah.  I was driving through at, like, 9 o'clock.  You guys came on at 9 o'clock there.  Cool.  All right.  I am looking at Snopes2.com, which is a website that has all of these rumors and puts a little 
[02:14:00]  green, red dot next to it, telling you if it's true or false.  They have the Halloween letter up here, and it is deemed false.  Started October 5th, and it's been passed around through email, yes.  The Halloween mall rumor.  People are so stupid.  I don't even know who reads it.  The second I get an email that has a bunch of attachments on it of people I don't know, 
[02:14:30]  I don't even scroll to the bottom of it.  The cure for AIDS could be on that goddamn thing.  Delete.  Because I know it's going to be, hey, did you hear the one?  Hey, why bananas are better than men?  Oh, eight billion reasons, all of which I have printed below.  Hey, that's good radio show material.  Hey.  Don't mock it, man.  Really?  Speaking of bananas, I'm at Bananas Comedy Club.  Oh, wow.  Hey, you whore.  Here's a guy who can really get into it.  Wow.  Look at you with the segue. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie tomorrow night, Saturday at Hasbrook Heights.  Bananas.  Yeah.  Anthony, the walking out of your house naked, is that on that site?  I haven't seen that one yet.  I have seen the one where people wanted you to light candles outside your house,  so the satellite photo.  And that wasn't true, right?  Pick it up.  Absolutely not.  That was a malarkey, Frank.  The man in the World Trade Center that rode the debris down, not true.  You know what?  I got a cause on that one, though.  Why?  We reported that as a real story.  Oh, my God.  Well, you know, it was all sketchy at the time. 
[02:15:30]  The silver surfer.  But that was early on.  Meanwhile, the silver surfer on his way down.  This is impossible.  But that was early on where...  Right.  That was that day.  We were believing everything.  Because we're like, no one is going to goof about what just happened.  Yeah.  And you hear it.  It sounds so fantastic that you would like to believe it.  Right.  And then they have the photograph captured an unlucky tourist posing on the observation deck of the World Trade Center.  We've all seen that one.  Have you seen that one, Frank?  No.  It's probably one of the most well-known pictures. 
[02:16:00]  This guy is probably the most famous person in the world now.  Because everyone has seen this.  I would think, yeah, his face has been on CNN, all the news stations.  This is a big fake.  Yeah, this is a fake.  Have you seen this?  Look.  Here he is.  There's the date, 9-11.  Here he is.  And look at what's behind him.  Hey, he's like, if you haven't seen it, he's in a picture, and he's in the front, the date, and the time is down there.  And hey, shh.  I'm just not going to say the rest of it.  Now, how did it get developed? 
[02:16:30]  We've been through this.  And then now what people are doing is they're taking his picture and putting him on the Titanic and every other disaster that's taken place through history.  It was, of course, Zellig.  And now the newest rumor with this is that that is actually Ted Nugent.  I swear to God I read it.  Dude, no, I know.  I am a friend with a guy that hung out with Ted and took that picture.  Oh, it's so funny.  The rumor mill is amazing.  Isn't it like another rock star actually took the picture?  Wasn't that part of the rumor mill? 
[02:17:00]  Look, there's a picture of our own black girl up on top of the observation deck with the same plane behind him.  That's my new favorite thing.  Felix.  Hey.  Hey.  Tell these clowns out there that's the exhaust coming from the planes.  I didn't think we had to explain it, but sure, why not?  Well, some of them are stupid.  You know, I saw a guy in front of me burning oil.  Is he spreading antibiotics too?  What the hell is wrong with these people?  All right, Felix.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  All right.  If you could just get antibiotics by spraying it out of a plane, I mean, wouldn't you do that? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, just fly over Chelsea and hose them down?  Oh, my God.  I don't think it works.  The rumor mill, the urban legends.  And there are people that believe that crap.  And a friend of mine was at the wedding, I swear.  And the groom said, flip over the plates.  And under every plate was a picture of the bride and the best man having sex. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You heard that one?  Yeah.  And you'll still get people that go, no, dude, I swear, because my friend was at that wedding.  And you smack them.  No, they weren't.  They're the same people that the four of the jokes you spoke about.  Yeah.  This one's funny.  This is great.  And it stinks.  There's another picture.  Yeah, he's in front of me, Hindenburg.  He's next to John.  Let's take a break.  More to come.  We've got to talk about George Steinbrenner getting his car stolen. 
[02:18:30]  Hilarious story here in New York today.  You guys have deteriorated to Beyond Belief right now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Frank Caliendo in the studio.  Frank.  Our buddy, our pal, he's on MADtv, man.  MADtv.  And he's now on the MADtv.com website.  Yeah, finally, they put you on.  MADtv.  A little fresher. 
[02:19:00]  Also, check out FrankCaliendo.com.  I don't know what you're going to find on there.  Are there naked girls on there?  We can put some on.  Internet rumors.  Internet rumors.  Nothing like that.  Get the horse gag video clip.  Put it on your website.  You'll get a million hits by the weekend.  My brother actually linked it as one thing with my demo reel with all these porn words and  all kinds.  Everything you can think of.  Because when you search in the search engines, there's like three letters in a row that it  searches.  So he put all these porn things on.  And then we have a demo reel that's on there. 
[02:19:30]  And it comes up.  And it got like 10,000 hits one day.  Of course.  To get to.  My name came up on the screen on a search.  And like 16 downloads of my demo reel.  Which people are thinking maybe this is a porn demo reel.  Probably thinking it's some kind of pornography.  People looking at it like, here's a guy who when he puts his contacts in, he can see  better.  Oh, this is going to be hot.  Where's the naked chicks?  Then it's me in makeup as Jack Nicholson.  It's like, oh.  What a bummer.  I'd be pissed if I spent a lot of time downloading video and it was that. 
[02:20:00]  I got to tell you, I'd be a little pissed.  I want people to go to the madtv.com site because I want to show them how powerful like  O&A is.  Because you try and tell people like in the promotional industry, you know, the promotions like  TV promotions.  They never, they don't get it.  But radio, you guys get to more people than people watching like The Tonight Show or anything  like that in specific areas.  Yeah, they don't care.  I mean, we're trying to get like Conan on and stuff.  They're like, ah, we don't do radio.  Yeah.  There's no power in that.  Trying to get let it out.  You know, I don't really want to do it.  It's radio. 
[02:20:30]  You can see my face.  You can see my head wagging.  That's the same.  Hey, you know what?  I want to play.  Frank Caliendo's been a guest on the show many times.  And he did the Seinfeld bit.  We haven't played it for the New Cities.  Yeah.  You don't have to do it live because we've got it on tape.  All right.  You can just sit back and enjoy.  There's a guy who was going to go into it, but he doesn't have to.  You don't have to.  Modern technology.  That's right.  And a lazy, chubby guy.  Check out this Seinfeld bit from Frank Caliendo.  It's short, but nice.  I did like a whole cast of Seinfeld in like an anti-drug episode. 
[02:21:00]  They never did stuff like that.  That would have been funnier.  You're like, tonight on a very special Seinfeld, Jerry's been doing drugs.  Why do my fingers look like little people?  Who are these people?  What are they doing?  They're talking to each other.  They're talking about me.  What are they saying?  George, help me, George.  I have no idea, Jerry.  No idea.  Somebody help me.  Hey, Jerry, you look like you've been seeing little people on your fingers.  All this comedy, all these years, we thought you're making this stuff up.  Well, I guess you just let the cat... 
[02:21:30]  Right out of the bag.  You can't tell.  Oh, I can tell.  It's written all over your face.  I wrote it on my face.  Well, maybe that was the little people on your fingers.  Who could have done this to me?  Newman.  Hello, Jerry.  Hello, Newman.  I think we're also set up Jerry Garcia and Grateful Dead come up with his stabs.  You haven't seen them.  Have you seen them?  I licked them.  Now I'm seeing little people on my fingers.  You ruined my life.  You ruined everybody's life.  In fact, you're the guy who dropped that thing and ruined Jurassic Park.  And you guys got it. 
[02:22:00]  The first radio station ever to get my bitch.  Of course.  That's great.  That was Newman.  Bravo, man.  Newman screwed the whole damn thing up.  Jerry, and back again.  Driving that Jeep in the mud.  Yeah.  There's nothing better than a good Newman.  And I love it.  There you have it.  I love how fast I was going, too.  Because that was like the first bit I did in here.  And I was so used to going into radio stations where the jocks got to talk. 
[02:22:30]  You know, they're always like, oh, well, that's great.  We're going to do it.  And I'm like, oh, that sounds funny.  Great Seinfeld.  You know, you don't get anything out.  You guys let me do the whole thing.  I'm going like 600 miles an hour because I'm worried that you might.  Yeah, I'd never heard you guys before.  And I thought you guys were like, oh, that's great.  Oh, no, he's doing Kramer.  Everybody at home, Frank's doing the Kramer bit.  He's doing the, oh, did I cut off the Seinfeld?  Sorry about that.  Oh, he's going into Newman.  Oh, we missed the George.  For those of you at home who didn't understand the voice, that was George Costanza.  Yeah, yeah.  George Costanza.  So, you know, not as good as the Seinfeld or the, actually, the Kramer was my favorite. 
[02:23:00]  But, oh, man.  Yeah.  You need the wah, wah, wah, wah, though.  Oh, hey.  625.  You nailed it because radio guys, there's a lot of radio guys that get really nervous if  they're spending a lot of time not talking.  Yeah, it's all that.  They feel like they need to be talking every 15, 20 seconds.  That's the one thing that's different about this show that almost, like, 90% of the other  shows out there is that you guys, like, have confidence in what you do and, like, enjoy  everybody.  Here's a guy who gets her. 
[02:23:30]  We'd rather not talk.  We've said everything we've ever wanted to say.  Dueling Ted Nights.  There we go.  Danny, sit down, Danny.  You'll have.  I forgot.  Here's a guy who can't remember.  Did we tell you what we did to Charles Corral?  No.  You didn't hear the Charles Corral story when we were up in Boston?  Oh, yeah.  Did we win an award that year?  I think we were presenting. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, we were presenting?  For the Air Awards.  That's some local dopey-ass radio award thing.  This was, like, our first year, so we figured we'd do it.  Got all dressed up.  Yeah, we had to get up to a podium.  Or a suit.  And announce the winner of an award we weren't even up for or anything.  Do you think we might win it?  Do you think we might win it?  Yeah, this is great.  Be not your tie, Gregory.  This is great.  Wait till you hear who beat us out, though.  You'll have nothing like it.  It's part of the story, but go ahead.  So Charles Corral was, I guess, the host of the event. 
[02:24:30]  That's their ceremony.  Yeah, the emcee.  And he's kind of watching, and he introduces us.  You know, oh, coming up, it's Opie and Anthony.  So we'd come out.  No one knows who the hell we are.  No one cares.  Well, you know.  Did they?  They definitely knew who we were.  Oh, the industry people.  Right.  Okay.  Because it was a room filled with just radio people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And radio people don't think anyone else is funny besides themselves.  That was hideous. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  So I go up to the podium.  The first thing I said was, thank you, Mr. Cronkite.  You know, it's Charles Corral.  I figured a little Ted Baxter, Walter Cronkite thing might work.  No one's laughing.  I'm giggling like a schoolgirl.  I think it's the funniest thing.  Then he does the famous thing.  It all started for me in a small 5,000-watt radio station in Fresno, California.  Nothing.  Nothing. 
[02:25:30]  I'm just like.  Tumbleweed.  All right.  We're now up for best news broadcast of a horrid event that people wanted to win an award for.  So this is when we were naive.  So we're up for best afternoon drive show in Boston, right?  And they announced a winner.  Some fat chick from Jammin'.  Jammin'.  Lady D.  Lady D?  Is she still up there?  I couldn't even tell you.  Some fat chick from, like, you know, a pop station.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, you know, we gave it, you know, the old college try. 
[02:26:00]  We lost.  Okay.  We won't be, you know, sore losers.  And then they go, let's hear the winning entry.  Yeah.  She was doing a weather break.  With the music, you know, the little part of the beginning of the song that you talk over before the words come in.  Come on.  Yeah, she's just doing it.  All right.  And it's 75 degrees.  This is Fat D from Jammin' Oldies.  Did you call this all Fat D?  62 degrees in Beantown.  And here's Paula Abdul. 
[02:26:30]  Now, see, that's pretty awesome.  Yeah.  And that's what beat us.  That's pretty good.  Well, you've got to be kidding.  The Beantown.  Yeah, yeah.  That might have clinched it.  Yeah.  The Beantown.  Comfort level with the community.  Maybe that's it.  She spoke their jargon.  That must have been it.  You guys were calling it Boston.  And that was the last Air Awards we did, I think.  Oh, no.  We did one in New York, right?  Yeah, you won.  Why would Ben be holding up a piece of paper that says something like 400-pound dyke?  I don't even know what that means.  We don't know if she's 400 pounds. 
[02:27:00]  Here's a guy who broke the radio code of silence.  When you hold up a paper, you don't say what's on it because you've got to look smarter than you are.  But when it's that dumb, go ahead and point him out.  Hey, we've got to talk about George Steinbrenner real fast.  Yankees lost last night.  And George, he lost a car, too.  Check out this scam. 
[02:27:30]  Thief takes a shine to boss's car.  Before they were stealing bases at Yankee Stadium last night, somebody stole one of George Steinbrenner's cars.  The boss arrived at the stadium early to meet with his front office executive.  Before they met, he ordered his driver and four of his security people to take the team's three town cars to be washed.  All right?  According to Yankee sources, Steinbrenner's security force took them to a nearby car wash.  They drove through the self-service wash and then got out to pay the cashier. 
[02:28:00]  While they were paying, a well-dressed man walked up to one of the attendants, handed him $10, got into one of the cars and drove off.  Steinbrenner reportedly was in meetings with team officials when the driver called from the car wash to tell him that while the cars were clean, one of them was gone.  Is that amazing?  Easily done.  Easily done, I guess.  Old Dirty's somewhere laughing, going, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:28:30]  Yo, B, that's the best scam ever.  That's the oldest scam in the book.  Gotta get some better gas station security.  This calls for the old Billy Barul.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I don't hear that.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Whoa.  Billy, Billy.  This is the biggie.  Hold me down, Billy.  $30,000, Billy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  They, uh, they did find it. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, they found, uh, George Steinbrenner's car.  Somebody had it.  And they asked him, uh, where they got it.  I got it from a Negro.  Oh, my, really?  Wow.  I can't believe they played that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  So.  Well, I bet the police considered it a home run when they finally got it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, ho.  But they were stealing bases.  Look.  Well, we're waiting.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:29:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know, the commercials were playing, and then Frank and I were talking about Ted Knight.  Yeah.  And he's like, why is the Ted Knight, you know, funny?  Because the Dueling Ted Knight thing that you and Frank did.  People love that so much.  I don't like it.  There's something about Ted Knight.  Even when he was trying not to be funny, whatever he said was funny.  I'll find myself a new greenskeeper.  Is that clear?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Anthrax is terrible.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[02:30:00]  It really is.  Don't let the spores get on you.  Don't breathe them in.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  The problem I have is halfway through a breath.  In this laugh, I breathe them in.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  My eyes, they're bleeding.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Felt like I went too far.  We changed for nothing.  I went them cleaned and buffed with a fine chamois.  Chop, chop.  Yes sir, yes sir.  Why, you son of a bitch.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:30:30]  Spaulding.  I want you on the golf course in five minutes.  Chop, chop.  Ha, ha, ha.  You're playing golf today.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jackie.  Sarah.  Monroe.  Mr. Ross.  Monroe.  Shut up.  Harry.  Mer.  Lou.  Lou.  We've just gone through every generation of these.  He is funny.  I don't know why.  You got one?  Oh, you got another one? 
[02:31:00]  Meanwhile, back at the Hall of Justice.  That's right.  He was that boy.  Superman prepares with Superdog.  And Aquaman.  Aquaman.  Who's played by Brian Regan.  Oh no, something went off in a volcano.  There's a volcano going off.  All I can do is swim fast.  I'm a swimmer.  I got green gloves.  But there's nothing I can do with mad moon lava.  Aquaman covers 75% of the earth. 
[02:31:30]  He can patrol.  Yet all the crime takes place on the 25% of land.  Oh, if there's a giant fish attacking you, I would be able to save you.  Unfortunately, this project takes place on land.  Calling the animals of the sea.  They could do nothing.  Like he could whip up everyone, the sharks and the sailfish.  You'll think there's telepathic powers.  Aquaman summons a can of fish.  A lot of good this will do for the villain in Wisconsin.  Charlie Tuna unable to help him on the swung. 
[02:32:00]  Damn it, Aquaman.  I finally found your women take their clothes off thing, Opie.  Huh?  Quickly, that rumor?  Because I was looking for it.  There was a lady that called.  She said she's been doing it every night with her friends,  and I wanted to talk to her, but she couldn't wait, and she hung up.  Well, I say it's true.  Get what it says.  The president has asked that we unite for a common cause. 
[02:32:30]  Since the Islamic people cannot stand nudity,  they consider it a sin to see a naked woman that is not their wife.  Tonight at 7 p.m., all women should run out of their houses naked  to help weed out the terrorists.  The United States appreciates your effort and applauds you.  God bless America.  From George Bush.  We must have naked people out there right away.  How are we going to weed out the terrorists doing that?  Because all of a sudden they go,  Ah, this is horrible! 
[02:33:00]  And you identify them as terrorists.  Oh, yeah, because they can't take it.  Also, we don't like naked women.  Weed out the rapists.  What was that one where, did you guys get that email  that they should take Osama bin Laden and give him a sex change  and send him back?  I have not seen that one.  I got like three of those.  That must have been a...  That's erroneous.  I did see the one that said that his whole beef with the United States  is that he had an accident when he was an infant 
[02:33:30]  that left his junk micro-junk.  He's got like that infantilism junk size.  Yes.  And an American woman,  while he was, before he was ready to have sex with her,  made fun of his junk.  So that's why we now have to deal with this.  This crap.  Then you're going to have to deal with me soon.  Because you bitches can't keep your goddamn mouth shut  about the guy's size of his junk.  It's the bitches that are against you.  Chris, what's up? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, baby.  And I tell you what, this guy Frank is hilarious.  I was hoping for Regan today, and I tell you what,  what you guys have there,  it's like a studio with Regan in it with Frank there.  Regan in it.  That's going to be the title of my album.  Frank Caliendo's got Regan in it.  New and improved Frank Caliendo with Regan.  Nobody else does the Justice League stuff better than this guy.  That's incredible.  How do I get this comedy goodness in me?  Meanwhile, somewhere on the road, 
[02:34:30]  a man listening to the Opium Anthony show  goes off to the side.  All right, guys, support him.  Go to FrankCaliendo.com or MadTV.com, all right?  Or Bananas.com.  Or Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  Here's a guy who forgot I was performing.  I did.  Meanwhile, somewhere in Opie's brain, nothing's happening.  You get to hear all these voices at Bananas tomorrow night in Poughkeepsie.  And then Saturday at Hasbrook High's Bananas. 
[02:35:00]  Frank Caliendo.  Sure.  I forgot.  I'm sorry.  What would Brian Regan sound like if he was over there in Afghanistan  kind of trying to find out?  Oh, goodness.  Got to look.  Oh, my God.  I don't even know.  Trying to think of something.  Couldn't think of anything that was PC enough.  Trying to think of something politically correct to say about Afghanistan.  Hey, maybe that's not going to work either.  No?  Trying to think of something.  Man, somebody bail me out of here. 
[02:35:30]  Where's the superhero's music?  We were somewhere in another part of the program.  Frank's still doing John Madden.  And then this is funnier.  And then there were little people.  And they're putting one foot in front of the other.  And the Burger Meister Meister Burger.  And the joke Frank was doing that wasn't working.  Got no idea what I was talking.  Okay, so they're over there.  Play the thing again.  Get me out of there. 
[02:36:00]  Back to the Adam Sandler bit.  A song for me.  A song for you.  Let's have a song.  I like baboon.  Meanwhile, another voice in Frank's head.  I don't know what's going on here.  I don't understand why everybody's got to be looking at me like this.  This doesn't make sense at all.  I don't see...  I thought you were going to hear you.  In another part of Frank's brain.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's a meanwhile, somewhere in another bit. 
[02:36:30]  We're trying to find a new Seinfeld bit.  We don't have one.  Oh, we can find one, all right.  We're going to have one.  We're going to have it.  Hello, Jerry.  Hello, Newman.  But meanwhile, Frank's trying to catch up with what he was doing.  Here's a guy who can't remember what bit he was going to do at that point.  And then you go, and then meanwhile, I've never been waiting for you this time.  I'm back in a song I was singing before, and I'm enjoying myself 150%.  Even though you can only go about 100, he's going to be okay. 
[02:37:00]  Meanwhile, back with Opie and Anthony.  Frank Caliendo.  See, it wasn't that easy.  We're coming back with what do we learn on the O&A show.  More girls, more good.  Hookers for everyone.  You'll get it.  No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused.  Yeah, we're back with the show.  Frank Caliendo, I want to thank you for coming in today, my friend. 
[02:37:30]  Thank you for having me.  You killed.  Yes.  Jenna wants to say hi.  You were killing her today.  Jenna, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  It's Jenna from Jersey.  Cool.  Hey, just want to let you all know that there were three mergers today.  This is what I learned today.  There were three mergers today, and my stock just split in bananas, Dwayne Reed, and Depends,  because, Frank Caliendo, you're giving away two-for-one specials at both bananas this weekend.  You're killing everybody, man.  I just peed my pants so bad.  I was like, holy cow. 
[02:38:00]  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I think it was a compliment.  I think it means you were funny today, Frank.  Here's a lady who should just say things straight out.  Yeah, exactly.  I was trying to be funny.  All right, no.  All right, Jenna.  It didn't work.  I caught, I just caught your, your Luthrax.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good one.  All right, Jenna, you going to go see Frank Caliendo at Bananas in Poughkeepsie tomorrow night?  I don't know.  I think she's listening to herself now. 
[02:38:30]  Wow, that is a prime example of an awful call.  That was a really bad call.  What did I learn today?  I got to apologize to Vegas for that call.  Yeah.  We're better than that.  You see what happened to that call, John?  She went for it.  She tried to be funny, and then it came back and got her in the end.  If you're going to go in, got her in the end.  You got me with that one.  If you're going to go in, you got to stay in there.  And Jim Norton is a guy that's the best at that.  And when he goes in there and stays in there, and I'm not talking about what you think I'm talking about. 
[02:39:00]  Well, somewhere in something funnier.  At least I have a new bit for you.  I'm a jukebox for you guys.  I get excited when we find new bits, man.  I love that.  Also, Frank's going to be at the Hasbrook Heights Bananas on Saturday.  He kills.  I'm telling you guys.  Real fast, a few what-do-we-learns.  Al Mack writes, today I learned that Spuds Buckley met Wrangler.  Then they went to Boston and met Gary Goldstein.  After that didn't work, they hooked up in New York and met Mad Max, where they now live happily ever after. 
[02:39:30]  While Gary wastes away in Syracuse.  Bravo, Al Mack.  Sheep lover.  I learned that K-Rock is like the Blue Man Group.  Kingdom of Nakedness is better than Club Naked.  Douche or Dressing, better than Pusher Pussy, which will stink tomorrow when Gary Goldstein does it on his radio show.  Al Mack, again, today I learned Voss is the salad.  And after two or three snows, you don't even know a house was egged.  Jerry writes.  He did learn that.  Jerry writes, today I learned Private Opie is a pussy. 
[02:40:00]  In two years, Buddy Epson will sound like a fax machine.  How good is that clip, though?  Him trying to sing.  You want to do it one more time?  Get that, Buddy Epson.  It's always funny.  No, no, no.  Just him singing.  Oh.  That's the Buddy Epson singing clip.  And then something like, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But he guessed I'm sorry. 
[02:40:30]  Doesn't he say something about him writing it down?  Yeah.  I'm writing it down here.  Yeah.  Here's Buddy Epson after we asked him to sing the theme song.  Hold on.  You can tell during this when he starts to know he's in trouble.  And he drags one of the lines.  I'm trying to remember what comes next.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack.  And the poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed.  And then one day, but he never, I'm sorry, when people, I'm sorry. 
[02:41:00]  People who need people is the luckiest people in the world.  You know what I think he did?  He actually saw himself doing it because he's shooting at some food.  He's about to say, pull the trigger.  He's trying to think, I was pulling the trigger on the gun.  About a man named Jed, poor mountaineer in America.  He came into America today. 
[02:41:30]  Jerry also writes, what did I learn?  I learned to do a perfect Robin Williams imitation.  You can't be funny.  Well, what do you want from me, man?  Come on, let's have some fun here.  Serious?  Yes, the serious.  It's a time I grew up here just a second ago.  Why not?  Let's enjoy it all together.  And you can cure a cold by 69ing a Haitian.  Chris writes, I also learned that Scorch's career is so bad that he was plugging Bobcat Colt-Wade projects.  Oh, man, sorry about that. 
[02:42:00]  And Haywood writes, I learned Blind Dave has a bed back and a new driver's license.  That guy's blind.  Let's see.  Yeah, I think we're done, right?  We're done.  Frank Caliendo, we'll see you soon on MADtv.  Thank you.  Or on the internet, frankcaliendo.com, MADtv.com, or at Bananas.  Here's a guy who's sinking this time.  This weekend.  Friday at the Poughkeepsie Bananas.  Saturday at the Hasbrok Heights Bananas.  All right?  Nice.  Anything to give away real fast? 
[02:42:30]  All right.  We've got a couple pairs of tickets to the WWF's Return of the Rock to New York City at Madison Square Garden this Sunday.  In the main event, the Rock will take on Stone Cold Steve Lawson in a special matinee show.  If you want to check out some wrestling, stay on the lines.  We'll take care of you, okay?  Thanks, Frank.  Thank you.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bubba Ray's coming in, right?  Oh, boy.  And some chick that's an expert on backdoor sex, I think.  Great.  We can say that, right?  Yep.  You didn't get that confused, did you?  What?  I don't know if Bubba Ray's going to kill me now. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, hey, I should say this, too.  They want me to say this on MADtv this week, Alien Ant Farm.  Really?  Oh.  MADtv on Saturday.  Loving the smooth criminal.  Doctor.  All right, cool.  You know what we do here?  Absolutely nothing.  That's wonderful, isn't it?  You'll be an Anthony show.  Hey, George Carlin's coming to town.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  He better come on our show again.  Yes.  George Carlin.  Two shows.  Two live shows at the Beacon Theater on Friday, November 16th, and Saturday, November 17th.

[02:44:00]  Nice.  Nice.  Right.  For tickets.  Remember that?  He would go, today, man, it's going to slowly get light, tapering later to darkness.  To darkness.  That's right.
