<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with an “After O&A Live” segment hosted, initially, by Sam Roberts. However, a "Wheel of Steel" randomly selected Roland as the host instead. This decision was met with immediate chaos. The wheel itself became a point of contention, with multiple respins needed due to it landing on previous hosts.  Anthony, calling in, voiced his extreme displeasure with the "spin the wheel" format, the guest choices, and the overall sound quality of the show.  The segment was significantly disrupted by a barrage of phone calls, many featuring vulgar and sexually explicit commentary, and callers expressing their negativity towards both Sam and the show's current direction.

Despite the turmoil, the broadcast unexpectedly included a surprise appearance by the original MTV VJs: Mark Goodman, Martha Quinn, and Alan Hunter. However, this interview was short-lived and awkward, with Roland struggling to conduct it and the VJs appearing visibly confused and leaving quickly.  The remainder of the "After O&A Live" segment consisted of more phone calls, complaints, attempts at salvaging the show with music and brief segments, and extended discussion about the disastrous MTV VJ interview and Roland’s unprepared and seemingly inept hosting.  The possibility of Troy and "Stringelo" hosting was mentioned, and the segment ended with a sense of foreboding regarding the next day's show. The overall tone was incredibly chaotic, filled with profanity, sexually suggestive language, and a pervasive sense of disarray.

The following segment focused on the fallout from Sam's recent time off.  The hosts used extremely vulgar and offensive language to express their frustration regarding the negative consequences of his absence, including a significant drop in lead-in numbers threatening the show's position and creating friction with MTV (referencing the same VJs from the previous segment).  One host even made a self-deprecating comparison to "an aborted fucking orphan."  The hosts humorously compared the show's perceived decline in quality to the "Christy Alley show".  They also briefly discussed Glenn Beck's recent emotional on-air breakdown, contrasting the media coverage with a Gawker report and mentioning Beck’s move to the Smodcast network. Finally, they congratulated Kevin Smith on the success of his film and its innovative real-time Q&A screenings via satellite. The broadcast then transitioned to the Ron and Fez show, featuring Hank Reynolds.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, it is. After O.P. and Anthony Live, I'm Sam Roberts.  And you know the deal.  The Wheel of Steel continues.  Spin the wheel, make the deal.  We're trying out different hosts, I guess, this week.  Next week, we'll be back to normal. 
[00:00:30]  Yay!  In our regularly scheduled situation with After O.P. and Anthony Live.  I mean, I'll be back to hosting, but everybody's welcome in here.  Eric, you're always welcome.  Thank you, Sam.  So how come you don't want to be on the Wheel?  I just don't.  Okay. I'm not trying to pressure you.  No, there's just a lot of other people here I'm sure the audience would enjoy hearing.  Because I'm on this show, I'm on O&A's show a lot. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  So give somebody else a chance.  A couple good bits today.  And that wasn't me who brought up the virus.  You took that into consideration, right?  Yeah, you get a pass on that one.  I mean, technically, I brought it to the air, but it wasn't my idea.  Instigator.  Well, that's neither here nor there.  I guess without further ado, we still got Troy, Roland, Travis, Danny, a whole bunch of people on this wheel.  So do you have the wheel out?  I'm bringing it over right now.  Okay, good. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, I know.  It's heavy.  That's why we can't bring it in the studio.  Does it weigh more than your hoagie?  Ouch.  Will you pass me that note to say it?  Fat recognize fat, right, Roland?  Oh, we're straight to the stop.  D-Boy might even be called.  His name's on the list.  He's on the list?  It's Ryan and Fez's interns.  They're outside waiting to see you.  Ryan and Fez's interns.  You ready to spin this thing, Eric?  Yeah, it's ready.  Gary's outside, and his name's on the wheel.  Yeah.  Should we put him on the wheel?  Let's put him and Bladder on the wheel.  All right, hang on. 
[00:02:00]  Just writing the names on?  Yep.  It's a dry erase marker.  That's why we can...  It's easy.  Yeah.  Okay, they're on.  Let's spin the thing.  Wow, listen to that wheel spin.  There's Danny...  Where it stops, no one knows.  You'll pass me the note after you read it.  Spin the wheel.  Make the deal.  Eric, you see who it stopped on, right?  Yeah, but he already hosted, so we've got to spin it again.  Okay, spin it one more time. 
[00:02:30]  You've got to spin it again.  If it already landed on somebody, keep spinning.  It's like the big wheel on Price is Right.  Was that Mars or Rob that it landed on last time?  It was on Rob again.  Oh, he's got to spin it again.  Oh.  All right, hang on.  You're going to pass that over to me via the Telefax in the studio?  Where's the monitor, by the way?  We still don't have a monitor in here.  It's missing with the headphones.  Well, I'll let whoever's hosting this get into all that because... 
[00:03:00]  Got it.  According to this, today's host of After Opie and Anthony Live, is it Troy?  No, no, no, because Danny, it's Roland.  Roland is the host.  Oh, sweet Jesus.  Take it away, Roland.  Hello, everybody.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Give out the phone number.  What is the phone number?  866.  It's 866-969. 
[00:03:30]  969.  1-9-6-9.  1-9-6-9.  That's 866.  I have to say it once.  I can't remember that.  Let me fuck it.  If you don't call in, that's okay.  Because guess what?  Let me get ready.  Eric, can we play a Blake Shelton song?  Sure.  Maybe a honeybee to get ready so I can prepare.  Yeah.  I feel like I'm back in Tennessee now. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, that's right.  They're coming.  They're coming.  They're coming in more than three songs.  Hotline.  Oh?  Take this call?  Yeah.  Hello?  Hey, it's Anthony.  Hello.  Hey.  How are you?  Asshole.  Listen.  I knew this was full of shit. 
[00:04:30]  I knew this was all full of shit.  It was going to be you right from the start.  We said it earlier.  That's not true.  Sam told me at 9 o'clock.  10 o'clock.  But the whole spin the wheel thing is bullshit.  Yeah.  I think it is.  Yeah, it is.  See?  What's playing in the background?  Blake Shelton's a honeybee.  Why?  Because it's awesome.  You guys are ruining, like, the tail end of our show. 
[00:05:00]  Look, I'm not the one who wanted to do the spin the wheel, okay?  Roland is the host.  I'm trying not to butt in.  This is terrible.  I know that, but it's not my idea.  It was supposed to be like, hey, by the way, Sam Roberts, the ONA live after the live  show live thing.  And here's like when we did something, like, a year ago.  And now there's weird fucking hacky wheel spinning sounds and guests. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, well, Sam, Jedi, I might trick the management.  Everything was fine up until last week.  Yeah.  Well, now it's the thing.  I know that.  I don't know.  Wait, Anthony, you're the boss.  What can I do here?  I'm no boss.  Oh, man.  I got to drive home listening to this shit.  Well, I want to host the show, but I'm not allowed.  No.  Do you have any Bruce Bruce, any requests?  Look, look, by the way, Sam, I didn't mean when you host, it's great either. 
[00:06:00]  But you always call in.  I was getting at.  I was just saying, what is this fucking savage in front of me with a flag?  It's probably the cab driver.  It's got a flag and a whistle, but it's like there's no traffic or construction in front  of him.  If he keeps me stopped here when this light turns green, you're going to hear a shit storm.  A fucking shit storm. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, you better let me go.  All right.  All right.  Get back to this.  Now you're playing bad music.  Do you want to play?  I can start it all over again if you want.  Yes.  Start over.  Brand new show.  Go.  Okay.  Eric, can you play the Bruce Springsteen 10th Avenue Freezer?  Give me a second.  You have to keep talking.  Oh.  So, Sam, how are you? 
[00:07:00]  I'm trying to stay off mic.  It's your show.  I don't know what to do.  There's lots of callers.  All right.  Line one.  Hello?  Roland.  Yes.  I have two questions, and then I'll hang up and listen to you guys discuss.  Sure.  Well, actually, could you play Pro Jam 1 for me?  Hey, why not?  Also, I called yesterday and asked about the interns, and I'd like to hear the update on 
[00:07:30]  what's going on with the interns.  I'll do my question, Rob.  Well, we're trying to work on things.  Things are in process.  And let's play that Bruce Springsteen song, and then we'll get to Pro Jam.  Oh, that's right.  This is for an honor of Clarence Clemons. 
[00:08:00]  Oh.  I can't keep on hearing Eric in my ear.  I think he's talking over the air.  Oh.  This is for Clarence Clemons.  1070 Freeze Out.  Oh, yeah.  Remember, if I talk over this, it's just a bed.  But you're not talking over it.  I don't know.  The only thing I did last night was take a shit and watch The Voice.  That's all I did.  How was The Voice?  The Voice was awesome. 
[00:08:30]  Give us the details of The Voice.  It was the final competition they performed.  And then tonight is the winner of The Voice, and we go on tour.  If you want to see the tour, you go to livenation.com and buy tickets for the August 6th show at the weekend.  We'll take a call, I guess, Sam, whichever line.  I don't know.  Hello?  Hey, WPLX.  Did I win?  You did.  Woo!  We won a kick in the ass and a dick in the ass. 
[00:09:00]  Call 2.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, we on the air?  Yes.  Hey, Sam, I got a question for you.  Okay.  Hey, Sam, why did you have me blocked on Twitter?  I appreciate you unblocking me, though.  Because you're an asshole.  Call 3.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, Sam?  Yes?  Stop your whiny ass bitching your whiny ass bitch. 
[00:09:30]  We're in Tokyo.  Anger.  Call 4.  Pick anything.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  You know.  Uh.  The word.  Trippy?  Call 7.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  What's going?  Yes. 
[00:10:00]  Listen, you may stink, but Sam sucks.  Oh, thank you.  You suck, Sam.  Sam does suck a piece of poo-poo.  Call 5.  Call 5.  Hello?  Oh, my God.  You guys are destroying the show.  All righty.  Call 3.  What's wrong, guys?  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Oh, yeah.  I hear you now.  All right.  I hate to tell you this, but I'm not in radio.  Mm-hmm.  But you guys suck. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  You should get another job.  I'll fuck your wife.  Call 4.  Oh!  Oh.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  It's Roland.  Yes.  It's Roland.  Yes, how are you?  I love your big tits.  What?  Big tits.  He loves your big tits.  Oh, thank you.  I work on them by eating a lot of steak and French rice.  Call 6.  Hello?  Hey, what's up, man?  It's Tony from Tom's River.  How's it going?  Not too bad, brother. 
[00:11:00]  Listen, I'm sure you're aware, like, the core audience of this show is, like, based out of,  like, you know, Jersey and Boston.  So we kind of have, like, this unwritten rule about no country music.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Why?  Why?  Because, uh, you know, I get it.  There's a lot of truckers listening to satellite radio and everything else, and they kind of like it.  But, you know, we don't really do that a lot.  Oh, okay.  I was born in Texas, so.  Yeah, I get it. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Call 4.  You depressed me.  Roland, I think we have some guests.  Oh, who are they?  You want to come on in?  Who are they?  The original MTV VJs, Roland, just for you.  Oh.  Come on in.  Oh, they can talk.  Come on in.  Everybody grab a mic.  Uh, do we have to?  You want us to grab?  Come on, you don't actually.  Roland, move over here.  Yeah.  Here, you can move this one.  I'll switch.  All right, what are we doing?  Hey, man.  How are you?  How are you?  This is where, this is after Opie and Anthony live, and Roland is the guest host today. 
[00:12:00]  I don't want to do it.  You don't want to do it.  Wow, perfect.  I just booked a guest, and I'm off all day.  And now you get stuck with it, man?  Yeah.  It sucks.  It does suck.  I say we bail on him.  Let's talk about how sucky that is.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  I like that.  Roland, you have legends in the studio.  Will you talk to them?  This is your show.  It's your show now.  I'll tell you what.  If you don't know everything about our past, you're fucked right now.  I grew up watching you guys, but then I blank out, though.  Talk about it.  That's Liam.  He gets nervous.  We'll help you do it, my friend. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Why don't we just interview each other on the show?  There you go.  So, Martha, what have you been up to lately?  Oh, gosh, Al.  How about you?  I'm just going to film all of this, if you don't mind.  Fill everybody in.  Tell me, have you done video for your new album?  Yeah, right.  No, we're going back.  Question number seven.  We're going retro.  Have you done video?  We're going to do stills.  24 frames per second.  It's crazy.  It's a crazy idea.  It's a second long video.  It's only a second.  It's like a new concept. 
[00:13:00]  It embeds in your brain.  It's all good.  That's fine.  Take over.  Thank you, everybody.  Good night.  All right.  It's been good.  Because usually...  Sam.  That was magic, man.  I know.  No, usually Sam's supposed to host it, but he makes one of us host for this week, which  is awesome.  So, where are Opie and Anthony?  Where are they?  Are they gone?  They're on their way home right now.  Really?  They're on vacation?  No, they leave at 10 o'clock.  Oh, they're done.  So, I'm confused.  It's an urgent message.  One message, you have to go to Opie and Anthony right now before they leave, and they hustled 
[00:13:30]  us down here.  Oh, I have no idea.  And we find one guy going, oh, I don't want to interview you.  It's kind of confusing.  No, no.  At 10 o'clock, they run home.  They're done.  I'll tell you this.  I need to just go to work.  Yeah, you go for it.  Yeah, this might be...  Yeah, we're in the middle of doing something down the hall, and we just said, come on down.  They said, come on down here real quick, but I might just get out of your hair area.  Yeah, I think they did that just to torture me. 
[00:14:00]  No problem.  Get out of your hair.  No, look.  It was good.  That was a great interview.  Oh, thank you.  No problem.  That was like the best ever.  No problem.  Good job, Michael.  Oh, thanks.  It's all good.  Bye.  Later.  Now you can have your life back.  So what happened, Roland?  Roland.  Yeah.  Put headphones on.  Yes.  So what happened?  What?  What happened?  I have no idea.  They just thought they were going to talk to Opie and Anthony.  No, we never told them they were going to meet Opie and Anthony. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, they said, where's Opie and Anthony?  I don't know.  But you had them in here.  Why didn't you do an interview?  I don't know.  You know a shitload of 80s music knowledge and trivia.  Why don't you talk to them about that?  Because my mind just went blank.  You should have sat down.  First of all, you didn't even give the guests seats.  They were all just standing up awkwardly.  They could sit down.  They know seats.  But you're the host.  You're supposed to invite them in, sit down, put some headphones on, get up to the mic,  and then have a conversation with them. 
[00:15:00]  Well, dig in my ass.  They know where seats are.  They can sit down.  But then they didn't want to be here.  So I was like, whatever.  They thought Opie and Anthony were here to interview them.  They're like, oh, is Opie here, Anthony?  So I was like, no.  So what are you going to do now?  Might as well play five clips so I can end this torture.  Well, you've got to tell me what to do.  You're the host here.  Play whatever clip.  No, no, no, no.  There's a list of stuff.  You've got to set it up.  Yeah.  See, Sammy, you could interview them. 
[00:15:30]  It's not my show.  It is your show.  But it's been the wheel, right?  Yeah.  Whoever's idea that was, that was a pile of shit.  Play that bit where it was funny, and people laughed, and things happened.  Do you want to play another song?  Will that make you feel better?  I mean, here's what you got.  You got a bit.  Oh, there's a lot of calls.  You got a lot of calls, or you got a line of the day.  Take some calls.  We'll do a line of the day.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  A line of the day is not set yet, so hang on.  Okay, or we could play a bit.  Would you want to take a call?  You should take some calls.  Yeah, we'll take a call.  Okay.  Boom.  Hello?  Hey, Roland.  Yes?  I think you're a sweetheart of a guy with a rapist wit.  But, that being said, I want to know why you have this problem with Fezzy Watley.  Why can't we talk about it, guy?  Take care.  Oh, I don't know.  Call four.  You're welcome, Rob Cross.  We're not...  Hello? 
[00:16:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Yes, Terry Hogan.  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know that I was fucking Macho Man Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth Evernard, brother.  I heard you had a small pee-pee, too.  Call five.  Hello?  Hey, Roland.  This is Rich in Ohio.  So, I got a question.  Why is it that when you sound unsure of what you're doing, you sound like a disenfranchised fat chick? 
[00:17:00]  Because I feel like one right now.  I don't know.  Hello?  Roland, that was an awesome interview.  You got the interview skills of Ron Bennington.  And, Sam, I'd like to say that you should have been a blowjob.  Oh, I hate you, Sam.  Hello?  Roland?  Yes?  Ramon!  Somebody throw Roland's popping fresh ass in the oven like a holocaust victim!  Ramon! 
[00:17:30]  Okay.  Hello?  Why don't you sit down and get comfortable, Roland?  Because I'm not comfortable.  No, you're standing there awkwardly.  Because I feel awkwardly.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Mel Carverson sucks dick!  Howard Stern is a cop!  You're a little slow there, Sam.  Sam.  I'm not clicking on the call.  Sam is.  Hello?  Hey, Roland. 
[00:18:00]  I got a question for you and a request.  Sure.  The question is, how do you feel about trading and collecting, like, Springsteen bootlegs?  Are you against that or for it?  I'm for it.  Okay, that's cool.  And the other thing is, there's a song that E Street Radio plays that Bruce only released  to the radio station called Lonely Night in the Park.  Could you play that?  It's never been released, you know, officially.  Only to Sirius XM.  I don't know if Eric has it in the let.  It's in the let, because the E Street Radio plays it once in a while. 
[00:18:30]  It's a great song for the Born to Run outtake.  What was it again?  Lonely Night in the Park.  All right, let me see.  Great tune.  All right, we'll see if you can have it and we'll play it.  Okay.  Have a good day, Roland.  You too, thank you.  Okay, bye.  Hello?  Man, those MTV VT's are very vicious.  Yeah?  I mean, as they worked for, like, 30 years, I mean, they should be able to talk to each other.  I mean, seriously.  They talk about their old days in MTV.  Hey, Mark, what about this?  Oh, hey, this. 
[00:19:00]  Don't be bitter about me when shit hits the fan and stuff stops.  They're upset.  Yeah, they're mad.  I'm like, how mad at them?  I mean, they...  Yes.  Hey, tell us a little bit about yourself.  Do you currently have a girlfriend?  Do you still live with your parents?  And how did you become the booker on O&A?  I don't live with my parents.  And don't have a girlfriend. 
[00:19:30]  And...  You used to work for Carson Bailey.  Yeah.  And then I worked for a company that they signed with XM Radio.  And they gave me this fine account that I met the guys and started booking for them.  And...  That's a bad deal.  Oh, my brother texted me.  Give me their autographs.  Well, Roger, they think I'm an asshole right now.  So, that's not going to happen.  And they all look at me like I had, like, a shit in my face. 
[00:20:00]  It's like, well...  They're like, hey, Mark.  Hey.  And then that's when she said, where's opening your ass?  And I said, they left.  And then I went, oh, I have work to do.  So...  Is that song called Long Walk Home?  No, no, no.  That's off the...  No.  All right.  Yeah.  So...  Give out the phone number again.  No, that's all right.  We'll just take another call.  I don't know the phone number.  No, they're on.  Oh. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Hello?  All right.  We can switch.  All right.  Go to the next caller.  Hello?  Hey, Roland.  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  I mean, Sam is crap.  Let me tell you.  You're doing a best job.  You have turned the absolute shit hour into explosive diarrhea.  Oh, thank you.  But you're doing better than Sam.  I warned them that I'm going to suck donkey balls.  And I don't want to do this.  As long as I accomplish that. 
[00:21:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  Ah, Roland.  You are fucking awesome.  Sam, if you ain't never suck a dick, you've thought about it.  And Blake Shelton fucking roll.  Oh, thank you.  Blake Shelton, Sam.  There you go.  Hello?  Roland.  Hello?  Roland.  Yes?  You roll, man.  All right.  You too.  That's a funny thing.  I know what he said. 
[00:21:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Jack.  Hello?  Yeah, you there?  Yeah.  Roland.  So, one of the last callers asked a couple things about, you know, where you live with your parents.  You have a girlfriend.  Yeah.  How do you book for O&A?  I have a similar question.  Sure.  Now that you don't live with your parents, do you have a boyfriend?  No.  I did not celebrate on Sunday, if that's what you mean, though. 
[00:22:00]  No.  You know, I mean, it's a daily celebration, man.  It's not, like, all about one day a year.  Oh, no.  I'm not, I'm not, yee.  Line of the day?  Yeah, line of the day.  All right.  I found that song, too.  Okay, play that song, and then we'll do line of the day.  All right, Tom, what do you want to do?  Well, which one do you want to do?  Song or line of the day?  Song.  All right.  We'll play a few minutes, and we'll do line of the day.  Who's? 
[00:22:30]  Sam, I'm like, thinking you're fucking nuts or making me do this.  It's not much of my idea.  This sucks like a, like a, you know, there's a piece of shit, and there's a bigger piece  of shit.  This is what sucks.  Is this on?  Yeah.  Of course it is.  Oh, we got Sterniola here.  Hello, Sterniola.  Oh. 
[00:23:00]  What kind of fucking train wreck is this?  This is an awful train wreck.  I just heard the 80s VJs came in here.  What did you do?  They came in here, and they thought Opie and Anthony were here, and they're like, hey,  where's Opie and Anthony?  And they're like, who are you?  And I said, I don't want to be here.  Wasn't that a big letdown to see you?  Well, then they were upset.  They're like, what was it?  So it's like, you're 80s VJs.  You talk to America every fucking day on MTV.  Why can't you talk to each other?  Why don't you just take fucking calls?  Look, the lines are exploding.  Just put callers on. 
[00:23:30]  What about the wheel?  Yeah.  Why are you here?  The wheel picked me, unfortunately.  Oh.  All right.  So it's all random.  Explain what that means.  It means a dick in the ass.  So you don't want to do this?  No, I'm not good at this.  Like, Sam's awesome.  I mean, Sam's awesome.  I can come here, banter a few witty lines, and they leave.  That's all I do.  But it's not as funny when someone's awesome.  This is pretty.  This is pretty.  I heard about three minutes, and I cringed.  Yeah.  I had to change it.  This is.  I don't do this. 
[00:24:00]  Like, Sam is awesome.  He does it.  He anchors it.  He quarterbacks it.  And I come in through a minute or so, and then I leave.  And Sam wraps it up.  It makes it good.  Why don't you just answer one of these callers?  All right, Sam.  We'll pick another call.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, Roland.  Hey.  Hey, you know, that last call we were starting to get somewhere when you said that you didn't  celebrate on Sunday.  Did you?  And you mention that dick in the ass a lot. 
[00:24:30]  Do you like to take dicks in the asses?  I don't, but they pass them out here.  Next call.  Hello?  Hello?  Jim.  Hello?  Yeah?  You're on.  What's up, guys?  Nothing.  We're just watching Roland quiver in the corner trying to talk to you.  Yes.  Well, that's what I'm calling about.  You know, I just got to say, guys, this has like been the best hour of cringe radio.  How was it when the VJs came in? 
[00:25:00]  Was it really bad?  I only heard a second.  That's what really topped it all off.  When the VJs came in, I mean, Roland, didn't you like intern from TV?  You know, you got some sort of connection.  Don't you?  Yeah.  Well, of course.  And then I just blanked out.  They're like, whoa.  The first thing, where's that one name?  Like, who are you?  I'm like, I'm nobody.  I'm just here.  Why didn't you mention?  I know, but I mean, you had at least some sort of, you know, some something in common with  them, guys.  You could at least, you know, start it with something like that.  Where were you a half hour ago?  I needed you.  Where were you? 
[00:25:30]  Hey, I'll come by and help you.  You got to try.  You got to redeem yourself in some way, Roland.  This is, you're batting 0200, you know?  I know.  I'm not good at hosting.  That's what Sam's here for.  I think, I think he's been the best, personally.  He's been the best.  Hello?  Roland.  Yes?  You stink.  I know.  I mean, I do suck.  I'm not going to argue at that point.  Hello?  Brandon in California. 
[00:26:00]  Hello?  Hey.  Hey.  Roland, you rock.  I love you, man.  Oh, thank you.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yes?  Hello?  Yes, you're on.  Hello?  Hey, Roland, what's up, dude?  Hey, how's it going?  When's E-Rock treating us to lunch again?  Oh, E-Rock?  Hopefully today, because after my visible performance, I feel like I'm being raped in the ass. 
[00:26:30]  Hello?  Hey, what's up, Roland?  It's Rob Devaney from Carnegie Hall.  Oh, hello, how are you?  Oh.  You want to fuck me?  You want to fuck?  I'll fuck your cock.  You want to fuck me?  You want to fuck?  God, I'll fucking fuck you.  Thank you, Joe Pesci.  This whole after O&A show without Sam has been people calling up to tell everyone how bad they are  and just listen to gay blowjobs.  That's all after O&A has become.  Let's see, another call for Terniola. 
[00:27:00]  Hello?  Hey, Roland.  Yes?  If you were presented the opportunity to go backstage at a Bruce Springsteen concert,  would you suck his delicious New Jersey O&A?  Yes, I would.  Call next caller.  Hello?  Neil.  Neil?  Yo!  Hey, Roland.  Yes?  I buy and sell paper in Chicago.  Can I host tomorrow?  Probably do better job than I would. 
[00:27:30]  Maybe the wheel will pick you.  All right.  Hang on the line, Eric.  We'll take your information.  Wait, who else is left on the wheel, by the way?  You?  Me?  How can I be on the wheel?  I can't even.  I told Sam distinctly that I can't even host.  Your name was still on the way.  Is this like the phone show?  Well, it's like the phone show if someone who couldn't host a show was doing it.  So it is like the phone show.  Oh!  Love it.  Roland, let's...  Come on.  Take another call, Sam. 
[00:28:00]  Just put someone on, Roland.  Just why don't you have a conversation with somebody?  You want another song, Roland?  Yeah, another Blake Shelton song.  Just to make me feel...  What's with you and Blake Shelton?  I love Blake Shelton.  I love country music.  You want to do Line of the Day?  We'll take another call.  Hello?  Hello?  Hey.  Hey, Roland.  How you doing?  Doing all right.  How are you?  Hey, did you like country music so much?  How do you feel about that new country?  I guess they call it like hiccup or hiccup or something. 
[00:28:30]  Well, I have a great opinion about this one.  Next call.  Do you have an opinion on anything?  I do, but I end it myself.  Okay.  Hello?  Hey, Roland.  Hey, how are you?  I'm doing good.  You're doing a good job, buddy, even though you normally don't do this kind of thing.  And Sam, you do a good job yourself.  I mean, not everybody can do radio and everybody calls in and says, oh, you suck, you suck.  They have never had a chance to sit in that seat and try to do what you do. 
[00:29:00]  So let's say good job, guys.  That's all I got.  Y'all have a good day.  Oh, thank you.  Actually, Roland Campos is on the phone for Roland Campos.  Hello, Roland.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  This is Roland.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  This is like a dick in the ass.  Hello?  Hello?  Roland, it's Larry Kent.  It's Roland, man.  How important is the cock?  Next time. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, I'm going to get stuck in the ass.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Roland?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you?  Yeah.  Oh, there you are.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm about to go through the one knee's drive-thru, and I need your suggestion.  I'm looking at the spicy chicken filet, but...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I would back up.  I would get the new, the, what's it?  The Asiago spicy.  Asiago chicken.  Yeah.  Extra pickles.  Extra pickles.  It's delicious, trust me. 
[00:30:00]  And they put a little bit of extra sauce, a large frosty, large fry, and large Mr. Pimp.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  You're on the air!  You're on the air!  Gay blowjob.  That's the first guy who has a solution for sex.  All right.  Next call.  Hello?  Hello?  Not a...  Hello?  Hey, Roland. 
[00:30:30]  Hello?  Roland.  Hello?  Roland.  Hello?  Yeah, Roland.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  This guy's a legitimate question.  Yes.  You want to do line of the day?  Yeah, we'll do line of the day.  Here's our line of the day from today.  Now you have two runners-up.  Ah, shit.  So say, here's the first runner-up.  Here's our first runner-up lesson in this torture.  Christ.  And then she came to the blanket and said,  Oh my God.  Dad, this is my boyfriend, Shaquille.  And he handed me his CD. 
[00:31:00]  It was signed to me.  Oh, yes.  I remember that.  Next one?  Next runner-up.  Yeah, that too.  I remember that one.  Fucking Shelly Long was happier to see Nicholson.  Or Shelly Duvall.  Shelly Duvall.  She should have chased Shelly Long. 
[00:31:30]  Get that fat pig Callie Erste in there.  Callie Erste!  Oh, that's the sign of a tumor in my old hetero.  And now Sucker Punch is out on Blu-ray.  Yeah.  You don't get anything out of that plug.  I do.  What?  Nothing besides this.  And now here's...  It's just so bad.  Shit show.  What's the name?  What do you call it from? 
[00:32:00]  And now here is line of the day with Streniola.  Ugh.  Here comes...  Something funny that was said on the show today  because we're here and live and on a vacation.  Sue and the company.  Or some type of a...  Actually, a cannon system, I believe,  was used in one of the first atomic bombs. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, that's better than Nikon's better.  Oh, that's right.  Nick Cannon's good.  The Hiroshima bomb used the gun principle.  Or the Hiroshima.  Yes.  Have it worked.  Think of Pac-Man, a pie-shaped thing with a slice.  Oh.  Wow, really?  And thank God next week things will be back to normal  with Sam hosting and this awfulness.  Where's Ron?  He's usually...  He's helped every host except you.  I think he heard it and he said,  fuck this.  I mean, I'm not coming in this shit show.  That's bad.  I still have a few minutes there, Ron. 
[00:33:00]  I have a clip.  You want me to play a clip?  Oh, please.  Play something.  Play something.  Play the show all over again or something.  This is disgusting.  One week off.  One bastard.  All day.  I'm singing. 
[00:33:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, man.  Why are you doing this to me? 
[00:34:00]  The ice cream.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks for playing that clip, Sam.  Oh, man.  These chits are...  All right.  Are we done yet?  You have like seven more minutes.  No, you still have a few more minutes.  Okay, we'll take another call.  Hello?  Hello?  You want to announce who this is, Steve? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's Carson Daly on the air.  Oh, hello?  Hey, it's Roland.  Hey.  Why are you telling people that we're friends?  You know you were only around to put a dick in my ass.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Hello?  That's Mike in Baton Rouge.  Hello?  Hey.  Hello?  That shit line today, Seth, is cutting into my Blake Shelton music hour.  Crank it back up.  All right.  You heard the man, Eric.  We got a request.  We got to play another Blake Shelton song.  Or you can play Honeybee again if you want.  Eric, are we really going to 56? 
[00:35:00]  Uh, no.  We could wrap up.  Oh, thank God.  Let's wrap up.  This was bad.  Listen.  Steve, Roland, everybody at home.  I have to say Mars was so far the best.  This was a fun experiment.  It's bad.  I want to be able to do my show again so badly.  I don't blame you.  See?  Are you glad I killed it for you, the experiment?  I mean, I don't know what else to do anymore.  I guess we have to keep spinning the wheel tomorrow because I was told we have to.  Well, who's left?  For real, who's left?  I would get Troy and Stringelo tomorrow. 
[00:35:30]  Troy is going to do awesome, so that might hurt you.  Troy's going to do, I bet you Troy does well.  Well, we got to spin the wheel tomorrow.  Well, we know the wheel doesn't exist.  Is there anyone else really bad?  It's not about hurting me or not hurting me.  Like, it was just supposed to be a random people getting thrown in here, but it's not.  I don't think it's working.  Really?  And also, today really sucked, too, because Roland couldn't interview people that he  could have had 9,000 things in common with, and also Ron wasn't in here to help him.  Well, I also don't take calls.  There's a reason why I rarely take calls on this show. 
[00:36:00]  Because you can actually host a radio show?  Yeah, but still, those three guys, I mean, or the lady two, whatever, they've been hosting  MTV for 27 years.  Can't they talk to each other?  Why can't you talk to them?  You're the host of Opie and Anthony after a lot.  No, but they asked me, where's Opie and Anthony?  And they left.  Look, this is bad.  I'm going, I'm going, it's going to be done.  I just want to do my show again, Roland.  Why don't you just end the show?  I know it's not your fault, Roland, and you did a great job.  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't. 
[00:36:30]  For what it was, it was memorable.  It wasn't.  I'm going to pull the MTV VJ clip for O&A tomorrow.  Why?  It's funny.  No.  Why don't you end the show?  I'll take a sick day tomorrow.  Talk about.  We got to go.  Taylor, go, take us.  Give us a goodbye.  Why?  Fuck me.  I got nothing.  All right.  Back for a second.  I just, uh, I'm hearing the rumors, and, uh, from what I understand, Roland. 
[00:37:00]  Sweet miss.  Yeah.  Well, not only that, but the MTV VJs are upset.  I'd like to go over this like it was a CSI investigation.  We know there's bodies all over the floor.  We don't know how it happened.  What did you do to the MTV VJs?  Uh, well, when they walked in, Sam goes, come on in, come on in.  And they're like, I'll get excited.  And then Sam left, he goes, there's your host.  All right.  Which, which VJs did we have then?  Um, Mark Goodman, Martha Quinn, and, um, the blonde guy, uh, what's his name? 
[00:37:30]  Alex Trebek?  No.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, crap.  Was Bob Seger?  Was Bob Seger in there, or was he just a guest VJ that night that I watched?  He was a blonde guy that-  I don't watch a lot of it.  When Adam Curry left, they needed another blonde guy, and that was a replacement for  him?  No, Adam Curry was second, right?  He wasn't one of the original five.  Um, yeah, and the, yeah, he was one, I forgot the guy.  See where the interview would have been difficult.  Yeah.  No, I just, I remember his name. 
[00:38:00]  I saw him, then I forgot it.  Why don't you tell him?  You can't remember your name.  What's your name again?  Why didn't you just interview them, Roland?  You know those things.  Well, because Martha goes, where's Opie Anthony?  I go, they left.  And then the guy next to me, he goes, what do you mean?  And I go, oh, they left at 10 o'clock.  And I go, I want to be here.  And then Sam goes, he's the one interviewing you.  Then Mark Goodman goes, is this how it's going to go?  I'm like, pretty much.  And he goes, I got business to conduct.  I'm like, okay, thank you for coming.  What's the business that he has?  I don't know. 
[00:38:30]  I was trying to help Roland along.  People trying to remember who his name was?  Oh, geez.  There's no reason to attack.  I Googled his name, and it had question marks.  His name ended up on the wheel, and he was having a rough go of it, so I figured the  least we can do is get guests in here.  Nobody else has even gotten guests.  And I let Roland, you know.  See, Sam, some part of me thinks that you're still trying to make this uncomfortable.  Now, we have a cleaning lady tomorrow, and I think she's going to be the one that finally  turns the corner on this.  All right.  I don't know.  What would you, letter grade, what would you give Roland? 
[00:39:00]  Well, are we doing it from a listener standpoint?  Like, did the listeners like him?  What other standpoint would there be?  Well, from a technical standpoint, like a person who quote-unquote knows radio would  probably not give him a great grade, but our listeners...  Look, let's face it, Sam.  The difference here is you are a graduate of the Columbia Broadcasting School.  That's right.  The Connecticut Broadcasting School.  That too.  And I believe the Cincinnati Broadcasting School.  You have to have a C in it.  You have done your homework. 
[00:39:30]  So, yeah, you're going to look at it in a whole different way.  Roland came in here fresh-faced and eager and ready to take on the world.  Look, this thing from Matthew Beck in Arkansas says best after show ever.  There you go.  So, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.  You play...  You know what?  Flyover country.  That's where Roland does well.  Yeah?  Flyover country.  Okay.  Yeah, and Luke is here in Texas.  Roland rocks.  Yeah.  Okay.  Again, who's going to stop in Texas?  It's a listen.  You'll look down from a plane.  Yes, the blaze shots in there, yes.  Have you come out with the other guy's name?  Um...  No. 
[00:40:00]  This was the guy that was in the David Bowie video.  Yeah.  That's how they found him.  He was in one of the funny David Bowie videos, and they said, he's so good in this.  He should be VJ.  He should be VJ.  What happened to the other girl, though?  The smoky voice girl.  Kennedy?  No, not...  Kennedy.  You're like 90s.  A few years past.  I wish I was from Martha Quinn.  See?  This would have been great.  Tabitha?  Or Tabitha Sworn?  Again, that's deep into the 90s. 
[00:40:30]  Why couldn't you just ask them these kind of questions?  Where's Tabitha?  Where's Kennedy?  Where's Jesse and the 8th Street Kids?  Oh, boy.  That Jesse was something else.  He grabbed the nation by the heart and just squeezed.  Yeah.  I did enjoy their enthusiasm.  They came here.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey, everybody!  Hey!  Hey!  And then...  Happy 80s Day!  I didn't invite them to sit down so everybody was standing and comfortably because I was  standing.  I was standing so everybody was standing.  Here's what I don't understand.  He has the book people, right?  Yeah.  What are those phone conversations like? 
[00:41:00]  I have no idea because he couldn't even begin...  It's not like he started the interview and it trailed off.  He couldn't even begin to have a conversation with any of these people.  In fact, he instructed them to have a conversation amongst themselves.  I got the guys up here.  You had Mark Goodman, Martha Quinn, and Alan Hunter.  Oh, that's right.  Alan Hunter.  No, you were missing Nina Blackwood and, of course, the late, great J.J. Jackson.  Yes.  I don't know where Nina Blackwood was.  She's doing okay for herself. 
[00:41:30]  That's a good question, isn't it?  She probably would have been pissed off, too, though.  I remember in 1984, I saw the most amazing band.  They were called Missing Persons.  Yeah.  Then Sam left me all on myself here.  Well, you know what?  Maybe he wasn't ready to interview VJs.  I wasn't.  Then I was, here's your host.  And they were like, huh?  I was trying to stay off mic.  You know, we talked about that yesterday.  Like, I didn't want to take Roland's thunder from him.  I had no thunder.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  That maybe we might not like it, but you might be the guy for the job? 
[00:42:00]  I don't want to do it.  What is he doing?  All right.  If you don't want to do it, then we'll keep looking.  Thank God.  Then we'll just keep looking.  I think I want more tomorrow.  I wonder what tomorrow's going to bring us.  Yeah.  Bad.  I feel like today.  Not good.  No, you know, Fred Brooklyn has offered to do this.  Really?  Yeah.  And he said he would show up on a daily basis and stand here.  I just see him waiting.  You know what?  Maybe we ought to do is just go outside the lumber company and pick up one of those guys 
[00:42:30]  that's out there, the Spanish guys.  And just grab them.  Yeah, it's just like a day worker.  I could work.  I mean, we could just have a little X on the wheel for that.  You know they would at least know as much about early MTV as Roland did.  There's no way they could have a worse interview than Roland did today.  Now everything comes back to me for MTV, so I was like, ah.  Here's what kills me.  Yeah.  The original VJs with Owen.  That would have been perfect radio.  Yeah.  We all would have loved that.  We heard all kinds of crazy old stories and what it was like when this thing blew up. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Except Roland, he said, why don't you guys interview yourselves?  Yeah, thank you for that.  So you worked with me, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Remember when we were both on MTV?  Now was it radio or was it video that killed the star?  It was crazy for you because it was crazy for me.  Did you have a great time?  Yeah, I guess.  I guess.  I was just working a job.  Yeah.  I remember.  I was there.  They have really spent the rest of their lives talking about introducing music 30 years ago. 
[00:43:30]  Well, I think the number one question I would have asked was like, aren't you sick of the 80s?  Now you're doing 80s radio?  Like, isn't this demeaning in some way?  I was watching some kind of infomercial slash concert footage late one night and Mark Goodman  was hosting the look back at the Us Festival and he actually made the statement, I'll put  the 80s against the 60s any day.  That's what Mark Goodman said. 
[00:44:00]  And I'm like, you really are making a lot of money off the 80s.  That would have been a great conversation to have here.  I forgot to ask him about Live Aid because MTV was the first one to broadcast.  You forgot to ask him anything.  I didn't even say hello.  I did.  Oh, yeah.  I did say hello.  Here's what I remember about fucking Mark Goodman at Live Aid.  He's doing the backstage thing and Led Zeppelin has kind of regrouped with, I forgot who drummed.  I think Phil Collins was the drummer for him.  And they hadn't played in years.  And he actually looked into the camera and he's going, what's going on? 
[00:44:30]  They're going crazy in Philly.  The set's going to be great.  And they're doing Stairway.  And I'm like, we don't want to fucking get this from you, Mark Goodman.  Yeah.  We rather would have been fucking happier in our houses to be fucking surprised.  Well, he wanted to have it for himself.  He had it for himself.  He wanted to have that moment.  I've now held a 20-some year grudge over it.  Well, I took care of him for you today.  You did.  I mean, I'm angry and he left.  Yeah, they walked out.  The 80s MTV VJs walked out of here. 
[00:45:00]  I've got business to do.  That's if they were bigger than this whole thing that's going on here.  And Martha was trying to say, we have stuff going on.  We can't be, this is kid stuff.  I've got to look at a calendar from 1986.  Yeah, they're voice-triking 80s channels.  I love it.  Anytime I'm in the bathroom, I hear the 80s channel.  And Martha Quinn's in there.  No, you don't hear me.  This is fucking great.  Yeah.  We've never played this at home.  I've been here all day.  I heard Mark went and took a shit like a few months ago.  Who needs a magazine?  They do.  They play in our bathroom constantly. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  80s or some country channel.  Hip-hop.  Yeah, he also, he warmed up the southern audiences because he started the show playing Blake Shelton  songs.  All right.  Interesting.  So he figured he'd get the country music audience that the virus doesn't normally get.  Was there a reason for that?  Do you love Blake?  I do.  Yeah.  How about Blake Lively?  She's good.  All right.  So you could do an all-Blake show.  Bad Blake, and off you go.  Yeah.  Blake Harrington.  You don't have to stop the Blake hour. 
[00:46:00]  Maybe the next time you're on the wheel.  Yeah.  I'll bring that up on the meeting.  They'll go, oh, yeah, let's spice it up.  When's your next meeting?  Every Tuesday.  All right.  Could you say, could we stop bringing the 80s stars in here?  It's really fucking intimidating for me.  It makes me really uncomfortable.  They look at me like I should be talking to them.  You know, some of those songs, when you're in the bathroom, they don't sound as good without the video there.  Like, you're in the bathroom, and you're like, oh, I wish I would have seen the video of that guy trying to punch his way out of the comic book.  You're like, is this really what this song sounds like? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I'm not enjoying this at all.  It's really simple.  I guess it was the video that was cool.  Yeah.  It was.  You know, that whole, see, like, now it's like, eh.  But now MTV doesn't play any videos.  No videos.  They're coming back with videos now.  Are they?  They're getting Sean Penn, Drew Barrymore, like, all these big A-listers to direct videos, and they're going to start airing them.  Yeah, I don't know if, like, the thing that's missing in rock videos is Drew Barrymore's fucking helpful hand. 
[00:47:00]  I know VH1 still plays videos on Saturday mornings if you're up in time.  MTV2 does sometimes.  MTV2?  Yeah.  VH, uh...  I should ask those questions.  Well, VH1 Classic plays the metal show.  Right.  It's my favorite show to watch with Eddie Trunk.  Yeah, that's a great show.  You should see the...  I couldn't believe it.  When you go to Chiller Theater, the convention in Jersey, Eddie Trunk is always there.  He has a line out the door at every convention.  They love him. 
[00:47:30]  Eddie just did a signing over in New Jersey at some bookstore, and it was the biggest signing they'd ever had.  I have completely underestimated the fan base that that guy has.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Well, he has kept Heavy Metal afloat by himself.  Yeah.  As far as radio goes.  No one else...  The songs that those people hear on the radio, that's the only place that they hear them.  So the people that love Eddie love him, because there's nowhere else to go.  And now he's got it on TV, too.  He's got it on TV. 
[00:48:00]  Mainstream TV.  He's got a best-selling book.  Yeah.  Although he seemed annoyed when he came on O&A, and they just, the whole time, Opie and Jay Moore  were just quizzing him on his list and talking about how...  Jay Moore's bad for Opie.  We all know this.  He's bad for Opie.  He seems like a bad influence.  Yeah, he is.  He calls and asks for your guys' show at 9 in the morning.  Yeah, he doesn't know what he's doing.  He goes, Ryan and Fez?  And O&A goes, I'm kidding.  Yeah, he's not.  He just really...  He wasn't.  No, you know he's starting his own podcast.  Jay is?  Yeah.  Wow.  Can he play some Mark Maron on the Entertainment Weekly, that four-page layout? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, that's probably why he decided to do it.  He said, wait a minute.  This is fucking great.  Yeah.  I thought it was stupid.  Fantastic.  Every comedian has a podcast now.  They do, and it's all the same comedians that used to not want to come in and do a radio  show.  You're like, I can't get up.  Yeah.  I'm like, we're doing night shows still.  I'm not going to go in for that.  It's radio.  You know, you can't smoke.  You can't drink.  Like, I can't drop the F-bomb the way I need to express myself. 
[00:49:00]  Now they're all podcasting.  And the weird thing is if you go into, like if you're outside of New York or L.A. and you  go into a comedy club now, it's almost like a Friday's.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, it just runs exactly the same way.  You don't know what town you're in.  Right, right, right, right, right.  It just doesn't matter anymore.  No, it doesn't.  They've kind of professionaled themselves out of any kind of excitement level.  Everything's franchised.  They just go do that show here, do that show there, do that show there. 
[00:49:30]  Same guys touring around together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You'll be my guy now.  That's what Bert the Conqueror said when that's how he got in with Jay.  Jay was like, all right, why don't we switch you around and you can open for me tonight.  And so he opened for me.  He's like, all right, you're my guy.  You're traveling with me everywhere now.  It's almost like getting pinned.  Yeah.  It's almost that strange.  All right.  Roland, to me, I put you right back on the wheel.  I hope you make it again tomorrow.  I know some of the original VH1 guys are coming in.  Scott Shannon's stopping by. 
[00:50:00]  Spinning around with him a little bit.  I'm looking forward to seeing who's co-hosting with you today because, what was it, Frank Watson?  Frank Watson was the big hit.  So far, I believe, even better than the D-man is Frank Watson, in my opinion.  I think that what you're doing is basically preaching to the choir right now.  Because I'm reading the feedbacks.  We got one of those pie charts up on the website.  Just keeps.  Yeah.  And Frank Watson is just dominating.  I believe today is Hank Reynolds, the newsman. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, that could be good because.  Because for years, I've always wanted a really good newsman.  There's so much, like, lightheartedness and just jokey-jokey stuff on Ron and Fez.  And sometimes.  Lower the boom.  Yeah.  I need to know what's going on, not just laugh.  That big murder in those hotels.  I don't know anything about it.  I would love to find out, though.  You went today with Hank Reynolds.  Now, I believe the newsman, Frank Reynolds, this is his son.  Oh.  But I don't know.  Okay.  But, you know, Frank Reynolds has been dead for like 30 years.  So this is his son.  The Jersey Shore guy confused me a little yesterday.  The Jersey Shore guy wasn't prepared, wasn't ready, didn't give a fuck. 
[00:51:00]  I think missed Frank Watson.  Yeah.  I think in the back of his mind.  See, I'm going through the same thing you're going through here.  I kind of have my own spin the wheel, and it's not working out as well as the idea did.  Except you don't even have a wheel so much.  It's just whoever walks in the door, that's your guy.  Spin the retail.  Like, yesterday, I think when your co-host was announced, he was announced without a, what does he do? 
[00:51:30]  Just his name.  Right.  So that was where I was like, what does he do?  What's he going to bring to the show?  Yeah, it's getting more and more depressing.  But then, occasionally, Diamond in the Rough, here comes Frank Watson.  Frank Watson.  And that was a huge show.  So, hopefully, we'll get another great co-host.  Now, is Opie going to keep an eye on the wheel?  Because that was the original idea, that Opie would take a little ownership over this.  And he's just, it seems like it's chaotic.  Today, he kind of pushed it more towards, this was Ronnie B's idea.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, I was in the room, and it was two of you together, since Opie's starting the show,  you would think, but I know it was an Opie-Ron thing.  You brought it up.  Opie said, this is a great idea.  Oh.  You know.  But now he's more like Ronnie B's.  You know what's happening with the failure?  You know what I mean?  Like, success has many mothers.  Yeah.  And then, failure is an aborted fucking orphan.  You think that's what it was?  That's what I felt today.  Yeah, because it's an aborted orphan.  You felt like an aborted orphan.  I am an aborted orphan today.  And it's almost like, if somebody goes, I don't know who's abortion. 
[00:52:30]  I didn't sign.  It's somebody's abortion.  I see.  You know there is.  Well, hopefully, we can get through this week of the wheel, and then put all the ugliness  behind us.  Yeah, but you pulled this for them.  Well, I mean, I've got to bring something to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's my job.  So, I don't understand what the point is.  But once we get this behind us, then what?  Well, then I'll go back to hosting the show.  Right now, it looks like there's nothing else we can do but that.  And that's a sad fucking statement. 
[00:53:00]  I'm counting this building.  I hope he proves to management Sam can't be replaced.  I mean.  Yeah, you can't be.  That's weird.  That wasn't my intention.  I think it was.  I was just trying to go with the flow.  Here's the weird thing.  Ant takes the vacation.  Everything's smooth.  Opie takes the vacation.  Everything's smooth.  Sam takes a little fucking time for himself.  And it's a goddamn nightmare.  I walk out of one interview I'm not in the studio for and what happens.  The MTV VJs are now, we're on their shit list.  And, you know, I'm telling you right now, I'm going to my lead-in numbers and I'm in 
[00:53:30]  fucking huge trouble.  Is that true?  Yeah.  I know because we were talking about how important those numbers are yesterday.  Yeah.  That's everything in this business.  That's what people look at.  That's what happened to Conan.  Conan didn't get the lead-in numbers.  He ended up in TBS.  Oh.  I don't want you to end up in TBS, Ron.  I'm going to make sure of it.  Although tomorrow, we still got to spin the wheel.  We made a commitment.  You know, we're the Christy Alley show on Thursday nights.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No, not that.  You're the Christy Alley then cheers.  Oh, no.  It's true.  Why didn't you say that to the fucking MTV VJs? 
[00:54:00]  It would have been a perfect talking point.  It would have been fucking hot as shit.  All right.  So, I guess I'm doing four hours of news.  Yeah.  Well, hopefully, he'll come up with some news.  You'll have a little boom, a little witty retort.  Yeah.  Back to the news story, witty retort.  And, you know, it's like a big thing because Glenn Beck said that he  was being pushed around when he went to the movie 39 Steps.  Yeah.  We were listening to him almost crying because of the way he was treated.  Now, in Gawker, they just showed him sitting there enjoying wine on a blanket with his 
[00:54:30]  family.  I also love it.  It depends on who you listen to because, like, Glenn Beck says, this was a massive attack.  Gawker says somebody accidentally kicked some wine over on their blanket.  Now, did you?  You guys had the audio today?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to steal that and listen to it.  Okay.  Because I didn't know he was in that kind of a problem.  Yeah.  He did it on not the TV show.  The radio show is where he did the almost breakdown thing.  And then he...  Well, he likes to almost break down.  And then he's...  I guess Friday is his last day.  That's right.  On Fox News. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And then he goes and completes Smodcast.  He's going to Smodcast this thing.  Is he joining the Smodcast network?  Yeah.  I think that he's out there, Universal Studios, and they got, like, a great room, and people  can come in and watch it, and Beck will all be part of that.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, he's doing good.  That's amazing.  Well, and congratulations to Kevin Smith on that, too.  Kevin Smith is making things happen.  Yeah.  I know he's releasing that film, and he's already paid it off.  Really?  He's already paid it off from that tour that he did.  And now he's...  So now the release is all profit. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  And now, from what I understand, he's going to do the movie.  You'll go buy the ticket to the movie.  Then, Kevin Smith comes on screen, kind of doing a Q&A.  Right.  Wow.  But it's just answers.  It's just him talking.  No.  It'll be in real time.  Oh!  It's not a piece of film.  Via satellite.  Yeah.  For every screening.  Yeah.  They're going to have to, I guess, tier the screenings.  He's got time.  The guy loves to talk.  He loves to get out there and talk about shit.  He loves Kevin Smith. 
[00:56:00]  Well, why wouldn't he?  I would.  If I were Kevin Smith.  I'll let you get back to Ron and Fez featuring...  What's his name?  Looks like Hank Reynolds today.  Hank Reynolds.  Ron and Fez featuring Hank Reynolds is coming up next.  Stay tuned.  Here is XM.  The virus. </pre>
