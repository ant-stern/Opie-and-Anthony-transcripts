<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties, delaying the start of "Whip'em Out Wednesday," a segment apparently involving a video clip.  The hosts then discussed a disturbing website featuring graphic content like electrocution and accident videos, prompting a conversation about online algorithms and the disturbing nature of such material.  They shifted to the Great White fire, reacting to its horrifying visuals. Anthony complained of a scratchy throat, blaming co-worker E-Rog. His exorbitant electricity bill due to his swamp-like pool and a near-drowning incident in his jacuzzi were discussed, alongside the unusually cold June weather.

The show then focused heavily on the iPhone's release and AT&T's unpreparedness.  This led to a lengthy discussion of various phone models (iPhone, BlackBerry Storm, Curve, Bold, Palm Pre, AT&T Tilt, Omnia), their features, and the strengths and weaknesses of different phone apps, including a marijuana law app.  A caller praised the BlackBerry Storm, contrasting with other negative reviews, and another criticized the show's iPhone-centric segment. The hosts reminisced about past successful segments, feeling the current conversation paled in comparison.  A significant portion involved a debate on the utility of apps, with one host staunchly defending his physical phone book.  The camera capabilities of different phones were compared, leading to a brief, hostile exchange with co-worker Trevor.


The conversation then veered to "Whip Him Out Wednesday," seemingly involving Twitter participation, and then to topless photos of Megan Fox, prompting explicit commentary on her physique.  The hosts then discussed a shared birth defect with Megan Fox.  The show played several old audio bits: a sexually suggestive Klee Motors ad, a sound effect bit with pooping noises, and a highly inappropriate sketch featuring Hillary and Chelsea Clinton in Africa, filled with graphic sexual content and racial stereotypes. The hosts acknowledged the latter's offensiveness by today’s standards.

A substantial portion addressed the David Letterman/Sarah Palin controversy, including Letterman's apology and the "Fire Dave" rally.  Studio guest Rich Voss, a producer on a film project with Opie and Anthony, joined the discussion, detailing the film's progress and potential offensive role for Artie Lange.  His on-again, off-again involvement in the project was also mentioned. The show played audio of a protestor's interview and a segment of Letterman's monologue addressing the incident, as well as discussing Sam Roberts' Fox News appearance related to the controversy.

The show featured extensive coverage of the protest outside Letterman’s studio, filled with profanity and offensive remarks.  The hosts interviewed several protesters expressing outrage over Letterman's joke, frequently using inflammatory language. One protester repeatedly shouted "rape," and another discussed perceived media bias.  A supposed supporter of Letterman was revealed to be part of a prank. The hosts mocked the protesters’ perceived lack of understanding and hypocrisy, also discussing the hypocrisy of some conservative figures. The hosts also commented on Jack Black's on-air expletive.  The segment included updates on Rich Vos's stand-up gigs, Jimmy Norton's on-air slip-up, Pat from Munaki's weight loss and upcoming hot dog eating contest, and Andy Rooney’s commentary on shoes.

A simulated Andy Rooney monologue, filled with graphic and offensive descriptions of his shoe collection and fetishes, followed. The hosts interjected with inappropriate humor.

A significant portion featured guest Pat from Munaki, a competitive eater, who discussed his difficult family life, strained relationship with his estranged father, his brother's criminal activities, and his impoverished living situation.  Unsuccessful attempts to connect him with his father via phone were made.  He mentioned working as a driver under the name "Philbin Transport."  Other guests included Rich Voss (promoting his shows) and Bob Levy (known for his raunchy humor).  Further tangents included a Belgian teenager with unwanted facial tattoos and a caller who nearly died.

The final segment focused on a conversation with Bob Levy, who recounted numerous lewd and crude anecdotes from his time on the road with the hosts and other comedians. These included graphic descriptions of sexual encounters, masturbation incidents, and messy clean-up situations.  He discussed the challenges of being a comedian, including poor pay and unequal treatment of headliners versus lesser-known acts. Rich Voss and Pat from Munaki briefly appeared, mentioning their upcoming performances.  The segment concluded with discussion of Levy’s upcoming gigs and humorous mockery of a guest's purse.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday!  Oh it is!  Yes it is!  Well...  Yes it is!  Then, Whip Them Out!  Whip!  Whip!  Whip!  Whip Them Out!  Do we have our Bluid clip?  You know the one where we go, ah, you blew it! 
[00:00:30]  Blew it!  I just looked at instant feedback.  I don't have that one.  This came in at 2.14.  Oh, in the afternoon yesterday.  Okay, I thought in the morning.  Indian electrocuted on train off YouTube.  Oh really?  We blew it for everyone.  They pull that, huh?  What's wrong with the headphones today?  Yeah, it was, uh...  You too?  I hear it too, it's not the headphones.  It's gotta be a mic setting or the headphones, we wouldn't all be hearing it. 
[00:01:00]  We're over-modulating there, Mars.  A little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  Yes, probably one button.  You blew it!  Oh.  Nah, don't worry about it.  We gotta broadcast now.  I bet it's, uh...  We're broadcasting.  It's gonna show up on this one site that I go to.  Yeah?  Probably, uh...  Oh, what site would that be?  I don't...  It's the...  I can't even say the name of the site.  Honestly, God, it's the one with all the dead stuff on it.  Oh, yeah.  It creeps me out.  It's just, to me, I love the site, but I don't want to plug it. 
[00:01:30]  It's too...  I can't go to...  I don't understand that.  I know we don't understand each other at times.  There's stuff we all do.  You can't go there.  That you're like, what the fuck?  Why does he do that?  When it comes to Jimmy, I don't understand why he goes to that website.  I could check out a video every once in a while, like the electrocution video that we've been checking out.  But that's it.  I'm not gonna, like...  You know when they recommend videos after you see a video?  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm gonna look at the guy getting electrocuted on top of the train, and then they're gonna recommend all these other horrific videos? 
[00:02:00]  I say no.  They assume you want to see half people still writhing in the street after a bus crushed them.  And then there's one recommendation for the taking of Pelham 123 train.  No, no, I haven't been watching beheading videos or anything like that.  I can't do them anymore.  I could take a little peek here and there, but that's it.  I never go all in with those type of videos, ever.  What I watched the other day was footage from that station fire.  And it's just a fire.  It's not really great.  You don't see people dying. 
[00:02:30]  What was the group?  White, uh...  Who was the group that was playing when that fire started?  Oh, uh, Great White.  Great White.  And they show...  It's like cam footage from inside the place.  Um...  And you see the fire start.  Yeah, I've seen that.  It's during their opening song.  And the guy backs out with the camera.  And you can see the chaos starting and the fire starting.  And then he gets outside and he's just panning the front of it.  And as the fire got worse, people ran for the door so fast.  They got wedged going out the front door. 
[00:03:00]  That's always the problem.  But there were people hanging half in and out who wound up, I think, burning to death that  they were pulling.  That they couldn't...  It was like being in a door and they were all wedged so tight.  And I guess as the fire was creeping, it was moving the mob forward in the hallway and  massing them together.  Fucking hard.  I've been thinking about fire for three days.  It's fucking terrible.  See why?  I can't do that because of that reason.  Look for the exit signs.  That's all I think about now is fucking exit signs.  I'm panic-stricken over this.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Terrifying.  Just get out.  Dude, they were out and they just couldn't get the rest of their body out the door.  It's fucking so upsetting.  That's why if there's some kind of plane problem, you're not going to make it.  Because everyone's going to rush for that one lousy door we got.  I'm always thinking, how can I knock out the little window next to me and can I fit  through it if I have to?  Nah, you wouldn't be knocking that out.  Because everyone goes into panic mode, piles up on top of each other, and then blocks  the exit.  That's what they say.  And remember, the nearest exit may be behind you.  They said there were other exits and everybody ran for that main exit. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  They said there were other ones that people just didn't go for.  I would just run right through the wall.  I'm surprised that many people pushing, the whole doorway didn't just open up.  The whole wall didn't come down.  As the camera's panting across, he'll stop and freeze it and say, these people,  uh, couldn't get out.  Their pressure was so tight.  And they show that someone tried to pull them out.  They said they went out burning to death.  Does he have to be dramatic with his commentary?  Well, it was just because...  I think we all know what happened.  It was just because it was a quick pan across a bunch of people in the front. 
[00:04:30]  And he actually went around the back with the camera and showed you the back of the  place burning.  And then later on, a minute later, two minutes later, you see the front burning with the  people.  Think about instead of filming the whole thing, you get a hatchet, an axe.  Where's the hatchet?  I don't know.  I need a hatchet.  Maybe get in your car and just...  It's the old west.  ...try to knock down a wall for the people.  Do something.  Drop the camera and be helpful.  Yeah.  Drive through one of the walls.  Right?  Yeah.  Uh, oh!  Ant's a little, uh, uh, a little sniffly. 
[00:05:00]  And the only reason I bring it up is because I like your little rant against E-Rog.  Yeah, well, I got, uh, I got, like, a scratchy throat and a little sniffly, and I completely  blame E-Rog.  He came in here, remember when he was sick?  Yep.  He came in here just, like, with that little cough, coughing on everybody, and not even  covered his fucking mouth.  He did it yesterday.  He's been doing that cough for months, just a little...  Just hacking on top of everything, everybody, coming in here, and then he'll come in 
[00:05:30]  and come, like, next to Ope and start talking and just get his germs everywhere.  Just, just...  That's right.  So you think you got sick from E-Rog?  Yeah, I blame E-Rog.  I think you got sick because of the weather change.  We're going back into rain after...  Yeah, now it's winter, so...  We got one nice fall day yesterday.  It wasn't even...  It wasn't even spring.  No.  It was, like, late fall.  It was, like, cold and rainy and crappy yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  Yet another just...  When was it rainy?  ...shit day.  I'm confused.  It rained a little bit.  In the morning?  Out where I was.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I didn't get no rain in the city.  Rain.  But it was a little chilly.  And boy, I just cannot wait to see my electric bill.  Holy mother of God.  Please bring it in.  Before...  I will.  Before the heater even went...  Was wired in, I had a $1,200 electric bill for the month. 
[00:06:30]  Now the heater is just going...  The pool heater?  The electric pool heater.  And, yeah, whoo.  And a propane one running all at the same time.  I finally got them turned on yesterday.  And now the temperature went down to where I had steam coming out of my mouth this morning when I went outside.  And I'm like, yeah, it's great.  It's June.  It's the middle of June.  And past the middle of June, by the way.  And I'm still breathing like steam is coming out. 
[00:07:00]  So all I'm thinking is, oh, my God.  The pool, first of all, last night before I went to bed looked like that swamp scene out of Apocalypse Now where Martin Sheen comes out of the water and it's just steam.  That's what it looked like.  It looks like a Southeast Asian swamp.  Nice.  And it's like you can't do anything fun in this kind of weather.  It's just too wet.  And, yeah, there's a picture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You should reenact that. 
[00:07:30]  That's what I looked like.  Do a little reenactment.  I went in there, yes.  I actually fell asleep in the jacuzzi.  Oh, I thought you were going to say in the pool.  Is that dangerous?  Anthony's going to die in some way where we're all going to go, God, that was so easy to avoid.  Why did he do that?  You can't fall asleep in a jacuzzi.  No, it was nice.  I put my head on the railing.  Oh, that's so bad.  I'm not railing, on the little cement coping with a towel under my head.  So I was sitting on the seed thing, and it wasn't, but it was just nice and warm.  I was just laying there going, oh, this is great.  You felt like you were in mommy's womb? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And then I woke up, and it was getting dark, and the lights were on in the backyard.  And I was just like, I've been here a little while.  How long?  All wrinkled.  Oh, you had that wrinkly skin?  Yeah, it was all like, ow.  The puffy, wrinkly skin?  That's good.  Where you touch it with a needle and just, like, explode.  It was nice.  But then I had to get out, which the walk from there to the back door of the house, not fun,  because it was fucking cold.  And it probably hurt, because your feet are all puffy from being in there too long. 
[00:08:30]  Like, ow.  It's every little piece of pebble.  Walking like Junior in Platoon.  Put any skeeter shit on your feet again.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're still wearing long-sleeved shirts here in New York.  Not only that, we're still bringing, like, light jackets in.  What's that?  I'm sure Travis came up with that one.  What is it?  Kramer sitting asleep in his jacuzzi he put in his apartment.  Oh, right.  The blow-up jacuzzi.  That was hysterical. 
[00:09:00]  But we shouldn't be wearing long-sleeved shirts and light jackets in the middle of June.  Light jackets.  This is the same jacket I've been wearing since the winter.  And yesterday, when we were walking out to the garage, I'm like, why am I still wearing this?  Why am I wearing my winter coat on June, the middle of June?  June 17th.  Yeah.  Big release date today, by the way.  With the iPhone. 
[00:09:30]  AT&T's not ready.  The upgrade.  They're saying AT&T's not ready.  Not ready with what?  Some kind of, like, uh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I know they're having a problem with their app.  I read the headline.  AT&T not ready for the iPhone upgrade.  Well, that's all I know.  The MMS thing they're having a problem with.  Of course they are.  Because it says all these cool things that you're going to be able to do.  You're going to be able to send video, audio, and photos through your texts.  And, uh, do it on the fly.  Snap pictures.  Write in the, into your text. 
[00:10:00]  And then it says, uh, not available to the end of the summer.  What?  Why?  Did they know this was coming?  It's like the, why?  Why AT&T?  I think AT&T can't handle all the data.  Data?  That's going back and forth.  And they should have not have taken the gig.  Right.  I forgot what they were saying.  The average phone user uses 40 MB.  But iPhone users use, like, I don't know, I think they said 400.  Oh, we're crazy with our data.  And they're just not ready for, uh, for, for the exchange of all that data. 
[00:10:30]  Then why, instead of fucking the customer, something like Verizon have some of it.  Who would be ready for the data.  Yeah.  Yep.  I don't know.  But that comes out today.  And then the new phone comes out Friday.  Uh, so, I don't know.  I'll probably upgrade my phone anyway.  Sure.  Should I?  Is it free?  The thing, but the thing is, here, here's the thing.  Why don't you just wait for the new phone if it comes out Friday?  Well, it does come out Friday.  But, I'm not sure, because I gotta back up my phone. 
[00:11:00]  I gotta back that bitch up.  You should do.  Back it up.  Back it.  And then when you get your new phone, you plug that in, and all your shit from your old  phone goes into it.  Right.  So, I don't know, if I upgrade to 3.0, is that gonna be a problem?  Is that gonna be an issue?  No.  No?  You can't just keep your phone and then have two?  Why do I want two?  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  Don't do that.  I wouldn't do that.  I'm just gonna.  I want eight phones.  I'm gonna back that shit up.  Yeah, tape them to your head. 
[00:11:30]  You don't back your phone up?  Oh, I do all the time.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm always docking with my friends.  I'm fucking Pete Plug.  I can't stop plugging my phone in.  Oh, you gotta.  Back it up.  Just keep sinking.  They call me the sink kid.  Oh, I know.  The sink kid.  And then they tell you, hey, you have to change this to your contacts.  Three deleted.  Four more new ones.  You're like, oh, all right.  I like that.  I like backing that up.  You don't have to worry.  Unless you use MobileMe, which is an idea. 
[00:12:00]  I don't use that.  I just hardwire.  Right in.  Goody good.  Oh, no.  I was wondering what Jimmy said.  Well, what happened?  I don't know what I said.  Let's say hi to Bob in New Jersey.  Bob.  Bob's gonna tell me.  Hey there, Bab.  Hey, Ant.  I just found out that you're a flaming homosexual.  Really?  It was on TV last night.  That's not what I meant, sir.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  What'd you do?  Nothing.  It was a mistake.  A little Jimmy Nordic. 
[00:12:30]  It was a mistake.  You can't make a little mistake when you're on a cable channel.  It was, um...  That is seen by a lot of people.  Maybe.  I don't know.  What do you mean it's a little mistake?  Did they tape, uh...  Right last night, they usually tape one of us was on.  Yeah, I'm sure.  It's the last segment.  What'd you do?  I just talked about Ant for a second.  What'd you do?  Uh-oh.  I'm embarrassed.  I'm gonna have to listen to that one.  I love that you say I made a little mistake.  Oops.  Oops.  Slip of the lip.  Can you elaborate, or should we just wait for the audio? 
[00:13:00]  It's not that long, so I'll wait for it.  It's not, you know...  Is it good?  It's alright, yeah.  I haven't heard it.  Oh, no.  I just laughed so hard that I got hiccups now.  Alright, well, I go on that show too, my friend.  I know.  It was a little mistake.  Jesus.  Couple of men.  Alright, we'll get to that in a few minutes.  What's going on in Iran?  Um...  Are the...  Oppression?  Are these people gonna get this thing done, or what?  Were they gonna back...  Done.  Are they gonna back out of their protesting? 
[00:13:30]  Government's pretty strong.  Are the protests as big today as they were yesterday?  I think, uh...  Yeah, they're still protesting.  I don't know.  I know they're cracking down a lot.  They've told foreign journalists, you can't talk to anybody.  Kicking them out.  They're shutting down a lot of the information centers, television and radio and stuff like that.  And then apparently, uh, Twitter is the big, uh, news outlet for, uh, people.  They've been, uh, Twittering pictures and everything over here.  And updates. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And we got involved.  Our government got involved.  Because Twitter, kind of clueless still, they decided that they need a, you know, uh, shut down for, for an upgrade yesterday.  And our government's like, are you paying attention to how important your social networking, uh, service is right now?  Yeah.  They did not shut down for an update.  People are, are, are using you and need you right now in Iran.  Yeah.  And they went, oh, all right.  So they didn't shut down so, uh, so they could keep Twittering.  Yeah.  Pretty amazing. 
[00:14:30]  The government's stepping in.  You see the one picture of, is it the, is it the town square?  Is it the gathering area?  The public gathering area where there were hundreds of thousands of people?  Pandemonium area.  I just hope they keep it up.  Yeah.  I mean, it was pretty damn impressive, but I think they're going to back down quickly.  Yeah.  They'll, they'll, they'll squash this, but at least it's kind of a beginning.  It shows the rest of the world that, uh, you know, there's, there's not some happy people.  Everybody isn't happy over there with Ahmadinejad.  You think most people are unhappy?  Uh, probably. 
[00:15:00]  You got to think the, uh, youth of America.  Of America?  Uh, uh, the youth of Iran are definitely not happy.  Yeah.  Overall.  Yeah.  They like new stuff.  You think the older generations, though, like, ah, this is all we know.  Yeah.  They're like, ah, you know, one guy's just the same as the next.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Cut your hands off for stealing.  Right.  What are you going to do?  But it's kind of interesting to see what they're just attempting to do by shutting down  cell phone towers so they can't communicate with their phones.  Is that what they're doing?  They're, they're shutting down, uh, satellites, uh, like Ant said, turning off the TVs, everything. 
[00:15:30]  Trying, but they can't stop, stop it completely.  Yeah.  They're fucking with the computers over there.  There's enough info being funneled out.  Still, right?  Oh, yeah.  So, but I don't see any coverage yet.  What, what time is it in Iran?  I mean, they're, they're, they're really fucked up with their time.  Were they way back?  Don't know.  I think it's still, like, overnight.  You mean, you mean, you mean, uh, socially?  Well.  300 BC.  Ah, yeah.  No, last night around eight, I think it was about three in the morning. 
[00:16:00]  So now we got to fast forward 10 hours or so.  So it's got to be in the afternoon there now.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be prime time for protesting.  What time is it over there, Dan?  According to the world clock on my iPhone, it is now 3 p.m. in Taranaran.  Wow, look at me almost nailing it.  See, can you get that on the BlackBerry Storm that quickly?  Oh, you want to talk about a BlackBerry Storm for a quick second?  Yeah.  I had that.  I had my old phone, which fell into the toilet. 
[00:16:30]  So a fan actually hooked me up with a BlackBerry Storm, which last night met its demise by my fist.  Because I punched the screen off of it.  Your BlackBerry?  Yeah.  It's the worst phone I've ever used in my entire life.  It was the shortest shelf life I've ever had of a cell phone.  Well, my cell phone guy said, don't get the Storm or the Bold.  So I went with the brand new Curve a few months ago, and I'm very happy.  Yeah, but you wanted the touchscreen in Verizon's service, which is why I got the Storm.  They weren't ready for the touchscreen.  Terrible.  They panicked because of the iPhone, and they got their product out a little too early, in my humble opinion. 
[00:17:00]  People that say it's better are insane.  No one says it's better.  Unless they have it, and they don't want to be full of assholes.  No one is saying it's better, Ant.  For real.  I'm reading somebody saying it's better.  It's not anywhere close to the right.  No.  For what I do, I love the BlackBerry Curve.  That's all.  I'm not a major tech guy like Ant.  You know, I don't need all those apps and all the fancy stuff.  You're doing this day and age.  Yeah, I want to be able to take a picture and email it.  I get to do that.  No, but you need the apps in this day and age.  I want to take a quick little video and send it.  I could do that. 
[00:17:30]  That's all I need.  Don't you want information at your fingertips?  I got it.  What apps do I need?  What apps am I missing out on, for real?  Besides it being like a cool thing, like, look what my phone could do.  It started out being like an old thing.  Look, it's a flashlight.  Look, look, look.  No, see, that's old school.  Give me some apps that turn around.  This now is.  Turn me on to some apps where I go, all right, wow.  Around Me.  That is a great app.  You hit this thing.  It knows where I am.  And the menu comes up.  Banks, bars, coffee, favorites, gas station, hospitals, hotels, movie theaters nearby, parking, pharmacies, pubs, restaurants. 
[00:18:00]  So let's say I want a taxi, the weather, parking garage.  How many times have you used that?  I use this a lot.  Oh, you do?  I use this one a lot because it's very convenient.  That is a great one.  The little Tweety app is fantastic.  My stock app, I just hit that button.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's start with the first one.  I got a phone book. 
[00:18:30]  I don't need that.  Phone book?  Where the hell are you?  You sound like my mom.  I carry a phone book around with me.  That's heavy all the time.  It's a little heavy, but it has everything I need in there.  You know how they used to hang from chains in the phone booth?  Yeah, like at the diner in Back to the Future.  Yeah, yeah.  I hope he's got one on his belt.  Yeah.  Just hanging.  They make them a little more compact, too.  All right.  So you got a phone book.  That's good.  Yeah, I used a phone book for that.  What else you got?  Well, different apps that take you right to Facebook and Twitter. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, the BlackBerry's got all that.  My online banking.  I don't do online banking.  I don't trust it.  That's crazy.  What gear are you in if you don't trust it?  I got Club Soda Kenny.  Your goddamn...  The bank teller is more apt to rip you off than...  I don't trust that online banking.  Cyber crime.  What's cyber crime?  Well, you know, that's somebody trying to steal from you.  Oh.  How about Google Maps with traffic?  I got GPS in my car. 
[00:19:30]  So you could sit there and go...  Does it have traffic?  Yeah, it goes red, and then it reroutes me.  Oh, does it?  Yeah, I'm good.  When you make a wrong turn.  No, and it recalculates when it thinks you might be heading toward traffic.  How about one-button stock trading?  I got right here.  I hit it, and I'm on my site, and I'm trading stocks on the go.  I don't need a day trade.  How about Liv's strong calorie counter?  No.  For real, I don't need any of those.  No, you don't.  They're fun to use, I'm sure. 
[00:20:00]  No one needs a car, either.  Let me tell you that.  You could walk across country.  That's what I'm saying.  But then you're going to waste half your life.  It's most...  Exactly.  You're going to waste half your life carrying around a phone book.  All right, give me another one, Ant.  Best one, Ant.  I don't even know if you have this.  These are all good for you, by the way.  City Transit?  Yeah.  The subway map?  The subway map is a great one.  How do you not know the subway map after all these years?  You click it on City Transit and you can open up...  Mine's not working right now.  Traffic cams.  Why would it in a pinch?  I got traffic cams. 
[00:20:30]  So all around New York, I could pull up a traffic cam.  Shazam is another one of those where music, you could just...  It listens to the music, lets you know what song it is.  You buy it right there.  Give me a song.  iTunes.  Give me a song.  I'll tell you what it is.  I had to play those stupid records for so many years.  Trust me.  You can't stump me.  How about I can order my Netflix movies right here on my phone?  Yeah.  There you go.  Netflix.  Bam. 
[00:21:00]  It's right there.  I got it on demand.  Police scanner.  I can listen to police scanners.  I got Scanner IPD friends.  I just call them up and go, hey, what's up?  World facts.  World facts.  What the hell is a world fact?  I translate.  I could just translate English to whatever language.  I do have German in here.  And how about a level?  How about if I need to level a picture?  When are you going to need to level a picture?  Can your phone do this?  Look at that.  It's a level.  It's cool. 
[00:21:30]  It's a level.  It's cool, but when are you going to ever use that for real?  You just don't know.  It's like having all these in your pocket.  When was the last time you used a level?  I was leveling some duct work back in 1993.  All those apps are great to pick up chicks.  No.  You go, look what I could do, but you never.  You're talking like a codger.  This is the future.  I don't need to level anything.  I have a dog whistle.  This is the future.  Why would you need a dog?  Why would you need that? 
[00:22:00]  We're going to learn in another year or two that you don't need any of these.  What's the weather going to be?  Today, it's going to be about 70 degrees, and we're looking at showers today, Ed.  Oh, yeah?  How many?  Scattered.  How bad is the showers going to be?  I'll call it scattered showers.  What time are they going to come in?  What percentage?  What percentage?  Percentage, it'll be about 40% showers today.  Probably the showers starting in late morning.  Is that good?  No.  It's going to start a little before midnight tonight.  What?  Yes. 
[00:22:30]  No, it's supposed to rain during the day today.  No, no.  Today, no rain.  The rain will hold off until about an hour, about 11 o'clock tonight.  Oh, boy.  See?  I got that because I got the updated weather that updates instantly.  That's nice.  Yes.  See?  It's just, do I need them?  Of course not.  They are the new conveniences of life where if you need to know something, do something,  find out where something is, there it is.  Touch of a finger, and you're there. 
[00:23:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  Movies.  Hey, here we go.  I click.  It knows exactly where I am.  All the movie theaters around my area listed.  I can click it.  I can then buy tickets right here on my phone.  They'll be waiting for me when I get to the theater.  Or you can even watch trailers.  Watch movie trailers on the phone.  I movie phone.  What?  I just go to movie phone.  Yeah, what do you got to do to get to movie phone?  Then pop in a zip code.  What?  You don't go to the movies.  How do you go to movie phone?  www.moviephone.com. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  You put an address in, your website.  I hit a button.  I hit an app button, and I'm there.  But you don't even go to the movies.  You got another app that you'll never use.  Everything says my house.  Right.  It just says go home for a movie.  You kind of made my point with the movie app because you don't leave your house to go  to the movies.  That's me.  Right.  But everybody else goes to the movies.  That's all I'm trying to say.  This is AT&T and their problem with the iPhone.  The new iPhone or the iPhone upgrade?  I don't know.  Upgrade's coming out today.  A new phone comes out Friday. 
[00:24:00]  iPhone fans, definitely listen up here.  Trouble for AT&T's wireless network.  USA Today reporting that the network is having problems keeping up with all of the functions  on the new Apple iPhone 3Gs.  The paper says the lack of network capacity is the reason AT&T is not offering multimedia  messaging and tethering options for the phone.  The company says both options are on the way.  I almost got that story right.  And I only read the headline.  I fucking hate that terrible fucking company. 
[00:24:30]  Now the technology is there.  It's in the phone, ready to go.  And the carrier isn't.  Oh, the only carrier you can use?  How is that?  How annoying is that?  Ugh.  Someone's head should roll over there.  That was probably Apple being greedy.  Of course.  Yeah.  Why couldn't they just, why can't you do Verizon too?  Why do you need five years of exclusivity?  Why?  You're with the wrong company.  I love Verizon.  It's all about the BlackBerry.  Man, BlackBerry's shit.  BlackBerry sucks a dick.  It's a fucking corporate thing, man. 
[00:25:00]  It's all about the BlackBerry.  No, it's not all about the BlackBerry.  It's all about the BlackBerry.  Hi, who's this?  Oh.  I don't have your name on the phone line here, so you got to tell me who you are and what  you got, bro.  Let's go.  Hi.  Hey, Jay.  How are you?  What's up, man?  Yeah, how you doing?  There's a really cool application for the iPhone called Chronicles.  And what it does is for anybody who likes to smoke pot, it gives you the state laws of  every state in the United States concerning the possession, use, and growing of marijuana. 
[00:25:30]  See, it's information at your fingertips.  Yeah, but I could knock down almost every one of these apps.  How many states are you smoking pot in, for real?  A lot of people like their pot.  Every once in a while, you might visit a friend, you might have a little weed on, you go, well,  I'm going to look this up.  But in general, you know the pot laws in your town or your state, and that's it.  But that's just it.  It's not everybody has to download every app.  You're not Lewis and Clark. 
[00:26:00]  I don't need that one.  You're not traveling the country smoking pot.  In a canoe, just smoking pot, going from state to state.  All right, what state am I in now?  Okay, I've got to look up the pot laws.  I'm finding the Northwest Passage stoned.  Right.  Well, no, because let's say you're in California where there's more legality for pot.  You know, laws are going to be a little different, whereas if you come to New York, a dime bag  might get you a misdemeanor charge, whereas in Ohio, it might just be a violation.  How about you ask the people you're smoking pot with, and you go, all right, hey, it's  your state, what's the deal?  Now, let me ask Anthony this. 
[00:26:30]  Sure.  Anthony used to smoke pot, right?  Oh, yeah, a long time ago.  Okay.  How many states have you smoked pot in, for real?  All right, let me think.  New York.  California and New York, definitely.  I think maybe a little in Massachusetts.  Okay.  That's three states.  I think that's it.  See, there you go.  That app is a waste of time.  Well, because I wasn't really traveling smoking pot.  Maybe somebody is.  Not many people are. 
[00:27:00]  But that's just it.  It's not this thing that has to be for everybody.  You just get these apps as you need them.  These apps are cool.  There's thousands of them.  You're hanging out in a bar.  You're trying to pick up a chick, or you're just trying to kind of socialize with somebody  like, look what my phone could do.  But then when it comes down to it, you're not really using that app, for real.  I'm using them all the time.  It's just cool.  It's a good conversation starter.  No.  See, you're looking at it as a fad.  It's a thing.  It's a useful item these days. 
[00:27:30]  Do we need the pot one that he just said, for real?  Some might.  Some.  It's available.  It's there.  But all I'm saying is most people that have it aren't using it.  All right.  It's just cool to have.  Like, look, look, look what I can do.  That's all I'm saying.  I'll say.  Which is cool in its own right.  I'll see that.  But I'm sure there are people that are using it.  Jerry and PA.  Jerry.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right, Jerry.  We're doing well.  What's up?  Oh, not much.  You talk about the iPhone not being able to do all that stuff they're saying already. 
[00:28:00]  I got an LG Insight that's basically like the iPhone.  Maybe not as good, but I'm able to text pictures, and I'm able to text video, and let's do video  conference and everything, so I don't know what the deal is with the iPhone.  I think it's much more AT&T than the iPhone.  I'm going to stop blaming the iPhone.  Well, the iPhone is...  Well, I got AT&T, too.  I'm through with the LG Insight.  Yeah, I got...  Well, a lot of people have the LG.  I got another question for Ant.  Now, you got the iPhone, who, you know, they're number one as far as brand new phone technology 
[00:28:30]  goes.  I'll even admit that.  I love my BlackBerry, but the iPhone just changed the game, as we know it, right?  It certainly did.  All right, so what's the number two phone out there as far as new technology goes?  You can't give it to the BlackBerry, because they didn't really figure out their touchscreen yet.  You know what's getting a lot of heat these days is the Palm Pre.  The Palm Pre.  Was that the iPhone killer?  Oh, yeah.  They're all iPhone killers.  They're all iPhone killers.  And if you notice, all these phones that are coming out are trying to be like the iPhone. 
[00:29:00]  Well, of course.  Which just goes to show you that that's the...  It's the superior phone.  You don't think all these phone makers grabbed the first iPhones and went, holy shit, open  this up immediately and let's figure this out?  Crack that open.  You got to crack that shit open.  And this is why BlackBerry is so fucking stupid, because by the time they get it figured  out, Apple will be out of their contract.  With that fucking horrible AT&T.  And they'll be able to put it out over better networks.  Yeah.  So then you won't need to switch to another phone. 
[00:29:30]  They should have done it now, and there was still three years left or whatever on that  shit contract.  BlackBerry not stupid.  They're selling a shitload of phones.  But they are stupid, because that storm...  Danny, why did you punch yours?  I was playing with the camera.  It was in his asshole, and he was trying to fist himself.  Well, I mean, this is over the last six weeks of furiously not using it, because the keyboard  wouldn't...  You go to type words, and they don't show up right.  The autocorrect is terrible.  Horrendous.  So then I started...  I was just fucking around, and I went to use the camera, and the flash would get bright, 
[00:30:00]  and you'd see it focus, but then it wouldn't take the picture.  I did it five times, and I just felt myself get hot and tingly, and I was just like, fuck  this.  I was screaming.  I'm like, fuck this phone!  Fuck this fucking phone!  And I just started punching the fucking screen, and I threw it, and I saw the screen just pop  off and fly.  And I felt good.  And I said, oh, I was like, I'm so glad I did that.  That's great.  I got to jump in.  Is there anything better when you reach the point of no return, and you just know you're 
[00:30:30]  just going to wreak havoc?  It's going to be trouble.  It is the best feeling ever.  The holding back thing sucks.  Yeah.  You feel your body heating up, and you're tingling, but you're like, all right, okay.  But then when you decide, fuck this, I'm all in, point of no return, how good does  that feel?  It felt great.  And I didn't even have any regret.  There's sometimes where you do something, you break something, and you're like, oh, shit, I really  like that.  I shouldn't have done that.  Yeah.  But it was nothing but joy, breaking that phone, and I had a spare phone anyway, so  I'm just back to using my old phone, which I hate, but it doesn't matter. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  But I just said, ah, screw it.  All right.  You know what I'm digging about the iPhone also?  I looked at what features are coming.  With the camera, you can focus on something just by touching it on the screen.  So as you're looking at what you want to take a picture on, it'll automatically focus  at what's in the middle of your screen.  Right, right, right, right.  But then let's say you wanted something more on the foreground, like, let's say I want  a picture of Danny, and I'm here, and I put him in the middle of the screen, and then 
[00:31:30]  I go, you know something?  I don't really want Danny.  I want a close-up of the microphone that's right here, and Danny then blurred in the background.  I could click on the picture that's already in my iPhone of the microphone, and that's  what it's going to focus on now, and everything else will be in the background.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  Yeah.  What program?  You could focus on whatever it is, just that's going to be the new camera on the iPhone.  You'll be able to edit video, too.  Edit video.  So you take video, and now you can edit it, cutting the front and back off. 
[00:32:00]  If you want a little piece of the video to send, you'll have to send the whole thing  or take it out and edit it and do things like that.  I was looking at deer over the weekend, and I was trying to get a picture of my deer in  the woods there with my BlackBerry, right?  And I could have used that.  It was focusing on your window?  No, it was focusing on a branch in front of me.  Ah, see?  Yeah.  And this deer was about, I don't know, 50 yards away.  I'm like, I want to take a picture of this fucking deer, right? 
[00:32:30]  You would have just tapped on the deer on the screen, and that's what it focuses on.  It kept hitting the branch in front of me.  Then I'm like, all right, I moved the phone so the branch is out of the way, but then  it would hit the next branch.  It was a nightmare.  Yeah.  And you're telling me all I had to do was touch the deer on the screen.  Tap it on the screen, and that's what it's going to focus to, and then you click the  picture off.  That fucking rocks.  Yeah, that I thought was a great feature.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  I don't know.  And look at the gaming on it.  It just, the graphics are good. 
[00:33:00]  I'm sorry.  I just think it's a superior telephone.  Dude, obviously.  Well, telephone.  I don't think.  Telephone.  We don't.  We say this all the time.  We don't use these things for making calls anymore.  My ringer goes off.  I'm like, what?  See, here's an example of it.  Look.  See, you touch the flower, and there.  Now the flower's in focus.  And the house in the background is out of focus.  We're watching the demonstration.  And there's a little soft focus on the house in the background, and you take the picture.  That's pretty cool.  And then it saves it right next to there. 
[00:33:30]  That's your last picture that was taken.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Oh, they finally fucking figured that out.  Cool.  Then it freezes up, and you have to reboot again.  And then you realize eight missed calls while I was taking that picture because the phone  didn't ring.  You are just a negative Nelly.  And you have the missed calls app.  Hey, Trevor's not liking the first half hour of the show.  And I'll read his instant feedback.  Oh, no, Trevor.  All righty.  He writes, you're fucking killing us here, guys.  I'm not sure, but I guess most of the feedback is smashing you right now over this segment. 
[00:34:00]  No, actually, everyone's all in.  Instant feedback is scrolling to a point I can barely read it, and every phone is lit.  Yeah.  And they want to talk about phones.  I got to tell you, no, you're probably right.  In the year 2009, talking about phones, it's a pretty hot topic.  And he's probably right, though, because one of the biggest selling phones in history is  coming out with a brand new version of that phone in two days.  The software update is today.  How many people do you see with an iPhone walking down the street? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, this is irrelevant.  What are you using?  A brick?  What do you got?  One of those bricks like Michael Douglas in Wall Street on the beach?  Oh, fuck your mother.  And instead of writing an instant feedback and complaining, you know what?  Maybe the show's not for you.  Go somewhere else.  Go away, then.  And there you go.  You solve your own problem.  Go to the Talk About My Phone show.  There are shows I used to enjoy, and they just don't do it for me anymore.  Guess what?  Let's change the channel and find something new. 
[00:35:00]  I think, Trevor, it's time for you to do that.  Because the phones, I don't even know which one you want to go to.  I have a BlackBerry Storm, and I love it.  AT&T Tilt is going to kill the phone.  Is Frank BlackBerry on the phone?  What's the Bold?  The Bold is not the touch, right?  The Bold's the one.  People are okay with the Bold.  They're not okay with the Storm.  I follow my BlackBerrys.  Trust me.  People are very disappointed with the Storm. 
[00:35:30]  Sam has the Bold.  Yeah, the Bold.  And that's nice.  That's a nice phone.  It was too big and a little too heavy for me.  And I could do pretty much everything he can on his Bold on the brand new curve.  Nice high-res screen on it.  It looks nice.  Sexy looking.  You want to go to this guy?  Rich in Tampa.  Rich?  Hey there, Rich.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey.  Hey.  I have had a BlackBerry Storm since December, and I have not had one issue with it.  I really don't know where a lot of people are coming with these problems with.  What's his name? 
[00:36:00]  Rich?  Yeah.  Rich, have you tried an iPhone?  I have, and it's a great multimedia device.  I ain't going to lie.  It's a fantastic multimedia device, but I prefer the push email on the BlackBerry, and I chose the Storm.  How about typing and functionality?  Dude, Danny's right.  That typing on that thing, when you go like, when you turn the keyboard sideways, and it's like a regular keyboard that way, their keyboards are terrible.  Because the Storm, when you're holding it regular upright, it has the double-lettered keyboard.  Can you change that?  Well, with the new operating system that's out, they have the full QWERTY keyboard on there, and I have no issues with the new operating systems that have been coming out. 
[00:36:30]  Wait, hold on.  As of when, Danny, can you change that?  You know what, I think, I was experiencing the same issue as you, and I didn't like it.  And then I think Keith actually told me that it's a setting that you could go in, and it's like an advanced setting.  But when it's standing straight up, you still have to have a double, you can't have a single-lettered keyboard.  It's a setting that you could switch.  Yeah.  But it would seem like it would have to be huge.  At the beginning of the month.  Oh, okay.  Thank you, Rich. 
[00:37:00]  I'll tell you, Jim, the problem with that is that the buttons then become so incredibly small, it makes it next to impossible to type on that thing.  And the thing about the Storm, too, is that when you go to touch a letter, like on the iPhone, you go to touch a letter, and it kind of magnifies, and you can see what you're typing under your finger.  The BlackBerry Storm doesn't do that.  It simply just highlights.  It glows.  Well, don't forget there was three different versions of the iPhone, you know.  The first issue was crap.  Yeah, but the dude.  It took them time to get it right.  You're right, but the screen, the touch screen, they can't change the way the screen function when you touch it. 
[00:37:30]  And the whole click screen, it's very awkward.  It does not feel comfortable.  It is not a good phone.  I could type.  There is a Storm 2 coming out, and rumors of November.  So the first one sucked, so I should buy the second one?  Like, how much fucking sense does that make?  Listen, listen.  I could tell you this much.  November.  Is that what I look like?  Yes, yes.  Listen, let me in here.  I could tell you this much.  I got a cell phone guy on Columbus Avenue, and these guys, all they want to do is sell fucking phones. 
[00:38:00]  Trust me.  And most of these cell phone guys are, you know.  A little shady.  A little shady.  Pedophiles.  So the Storm comes in, and I run to the store.  I'm like, I got to get the BlackBerry Storm.  He gives it to me.  I'm taking a look at it, and he goes, just shakes his head.  Oh, shakes his head now?  He goes, no.  And I had an older curve at this point.  I was ready for a new phone.  He shakes his head.  He goes, don't do it.  Oh, boy.  Not happy with it?  You're not going to be happy with it?  He goes, wait two or three months.  I'll have the brand new curve. 
[00:38:30]  So he basically lost a sale that day.  Yeah.  He could have easily gave me.  I was ready.  I was like excited.  I had the money out of my pocket.  Like, give me the fucking Storm.  He was the one who said, don't do it.  He goes, trust me on this.  Don't do it.  You know how I knew the Storm was terrible because I bought it at the Verizon store on  57th, or I wanted to buy it there, and they never had them in around Thanksgiving after  whatever, right before the Christmas rush, they didn't get them.  And I'm like, what new product doesn't have a whole, you have to order it from the store,  but they don't have them there?  What doesn't have the product in hand? 
[00:39:00]  And I realized they're probably just not making them.  And it's like, I wish the store employees would have been more honest because I'm like,  is there a problem with this?  Because it's not here for Christmas rush.  That's unheard of.  Yeah.  They don't want too many out there because it'll make them look bad.  I'll turn you on to my guy.  Very honest.  And I buy a lot of phones from the guy.  Now I do because of that.  I've bought like three or four phones since then for other people in my family.  Yeah.  There's something else.  Oh, I had an iPhone. 
[00:39:30]  No one knows that.  What?  And it scared me.  So I gave it away to who got my iPhone.  Danny did.  All right.  I gave my iPhone to Dan.  And I like it.  I love it.  I use it every day.  And it's slowly pushing my BlackBerry away.  And I'll tell you, when my contract is up with Verizon, I'm not going to renew.  I'm just getting rid of this.  And I'm just iPhone exclusive.  I can't imagine just like not having the goddamn thing.  They fucked up.  Verizon completely fucked up. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  It's like when you'd walk around.  It's like when you'd go around for a while on like road trips.  When we take road trips, pack the frigging laptop in the laptop bag and you go out like  that.  If you're going on a trip that isn't going to be a long time, like a one day kind of  thing, I don't even take a laptop anymore.  No, I don't need that.  I don't need one.  Yep.  Same with me.  I got the mail.  I got the internet.  Whatever I need that my laptop could give me, I could just use the iPhone.  You got Wi-Fi in that, obviously, right?  That's what I like.  Obviously, right?  Oh, hells yes.  No, I could do all that.  And by the way, Eric in Tennessee, Opie could download all these apps that Ann was talking  about. 
[00:40:30]  I know that.  Not as convenient to use.  I was just fucking around, man.  Actually, some of those apps sound pretty cool.  Robert writes, what about a Dictaphone app for texts?  Dictaphone.  Where you talk and then it starts texting.  They're doing voice activated stuff with the new iPhone also.  We're getting there.  A lot of voice activated for apps and for your phone contacts, things like that.  And you don't have to practice saying the name or load it in.  It knows what you're saying.  With the maps also, with the directions, Google Maps, with the GPS, it can tell you what direction 
[00:41:00]  you're facing when you're in map mode.  I'm sorry.  I'm just, you know.  I'm listening.  I'm a big fan.  I'm listening, but.  I'm a fan boy.  Well, Trevor's a bit obsessed.  We gave him a little spanking and he just won't stop.  Trevor, turn off the show.  You're embarrassing yourself.  Why doesn't Trevor call?  Why does he just fucking.  You know, to the haters out there, just go away. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, don't listen.  So who cares?  It's very simple.  Enough people turn off the radio show.  Then the problem will be solved.  We'll be gone.  Trust me.  Trevor writes, Iron Mike in England, tooling on CBS, Ronnie Reagan, peanut butter and jelly  in Sacrete bags, Razor scooters, Al Roker eating sushi, the Egyptian magician pilot, journey  to the center of this, of Celine Dion's camel toe.  But I'm way off base with this.  You just listed our greatest hits, you dummy.  Yeah, thanks. 
[00:42:00]  He listed about an hour of radio right there.  Right.  Yeah.  That's our greatest hits, you idiot.  Yeah, that's enough.  What do you think we were doing in between those?  Right.  This.  We were doing these type of breaks.  This.  Way to know the show, idiot.  That is great.  Trevor, just go away.  The show is past your body.  That's like that Paul McCartney song, that horrible ding, ding, ding, ding, with the fucking  ukulele that he's playing in there, and then just going, yesterday, fucking, yeah, I want  to hold your hand. 
[00:42:30]  Fucking Abbey Road, the whole album that he just put out this crap.  He just listed a bunch of bits from N.E.W., and I'm telling you, we did ourselves a disservice  by bringing the N.E.W. stuff with us, meaning as we moved forward in our careers, bringing  the old material.  Most radio guys do not do that, by the way.  And it being online, too.  Right.  But what people don't understand is in between those bits were just hours of nothingness.  Yes.  Of nothingness. 
[00:43:00]  Trolling the phones and just trying to figure out the next great bit.  And replaying those bits.  And I wish, no, we should do, but.  Two or three times a day.  Yeah.  I know what I wish we could do, but I don't think we have enough confidence to do this,  is to play all the.  One whole show?  All the hours where we were doing nothing.  Well, that's good.  Cut out all the good parts.  Right.  Right.  That guy's an ass.  AT&T Tilt is going to kill the iPhone.  Everything's going to kill the iPhone. 
[00:43:30]  No, it's not.  The iPhone has a huge head start.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I didn't say it's going to kill the iPhone.  The iPhone is awesome.  The iPhone is a great multimedia app.  It's slick.  But the problem is, if you're hardcore, if you're really worried about data, you're worried  about what you're doing, there's nothing better than the AT&T Tilt.  Dude, it's AT&T.  Jimmy, I got a question for you.  Sure.  Did you sync your iPhone, you know, all your contacts and everything?  I remember you complaining that you had to retype stuff. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  That was his mistake.  The AT&T Tilt, everything synchronizes.  No problem.  I synchronized with that.  Look, I synchronized with all my applications.  Completely Windows-based.  Open it up.  Got the keyboard.  Yeah, it's Windows-based, too.  It's also...  Hold on.  It's Windows-based, to me, which makes it kind of stink.  And also, if it's AT&T, bro, like, the problem with the iPhone was MobileMe just wasn't  good.  But if it's AT&T, I am not going to like it.  Dude, it's unfortunate.  I wish it wasn't like that.  First of all, the AT&T Tilt, I'm looking at it right now, it's Windows Mobile-based, 
[00:44:30]  which sucks my dick.  Horrendous.  And it comes with a stylus.  Ah, stylus.  No, it doesn't.  That's to poke your own eyes out.  How funny is it when you run into someone that pulls out that stylus?  A stylus.  I mean, remember when the stylus was kind of cool?  Because I was like, wow, what are you doing?  Every time I go into the back office, I run into somebody with a stylus.  Who has a fucking stylus?  Stylus.  Yes, I do.  Stylus is optional.  Steve's got a stylus.  To deal my prostate with.  You call it a stylus, I call it an aluminum bat. 
[00:45:00]  Or the fat antenna.  The fat, stubby antenna on the phones.  You see those every once in a while, too.  Hello, is this Mike Tyson?  Yeah, I'm using my iPhone, Ronnie.  What are you using?  Yes, I'm using the BlackBerry Storm.  I find it better.  You're stupid, Ronnie.  You don't know what a better phone is.  Look at all the apps I have.  Yes.  Well, I can get the apps, too.  See, isn't this great? 
[00:45:30]  Are you digging it?  There you go, Trevor.  Huh?  Do you like it, Trevor?  That's just for you.  What if they were selling them with rookie cards and baseball cards?  I would pick up the iPhone.  Get an iPhone, people.  The apps are coming for free.  Let me open one up for you here.  Look, it's a Sammy Sosa app.  It shows him doing steroids in his hiney.  Sammy's in a bit of trouble.  Do you think that Tony Danza would use the iPhone or the BlackBerry Storm?  Well, that's too current, Jimmy. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, yeah, that is very current.  We only listed stuff from 15 years ago.  We did that.  We did that.  10 years ago.  On XM.  Yeah.  My God, that's insanity.  Oh, you're right.  I apologize.  We've got to go back to the days when we were great.  Right.  Yes, of course.  You don't need all this.  Damn you all to hell with your stupid iPhone.  Damn you.  How am I supposed to get the traffic?  When I give the traffic, remember, I did traffic reports way back in the old days. 
[00:46:30]  When we were good.  NBC Nightly News.  The iPhone, Apple, little buttons that you put are going to be coming out.  New ones in version 3.0.  Right.  I was fantastic.  Now I suck.  What did you call on to deliver?  To deliver Chinese food.  Hi, it's Yoshi.  We're not allowed to do Yoshi.  I can't hear you.  We weren't allowed to do Yoshi.  That was the first bit they took away from us.  Jesus Christ.  Good old Yoshi. 
[00:47:00]  The Yoshi bit.  Yoshi.  What a hack fucking bit that was.  What was it?  I was the Chinese food delivery guy on the bike.  But we had a song and everything.  Of course we did.  Did you really?  A song?  Do we have our Yoshi song?  We'll play our Yoshi song today.  I'm sure that dick bag will love it.  Nah, he's gone, right, Trevor?  You took my advice?  I doubt you did.  Pete in Delaware.  App Converter will get open to all those apps.  Everyone is listening.  That's what you want.  App Converter.  Omnia has a 12. 
[00:47:30]  That sounds fucking handy.  Omnia has a 12 megapik camera and service that works.  I got, my BlackBerry's got what?  What am I up to?  A 3.2.  I'm pretty happy with that, but I want it a little higher.  Are you making posters?  Yeah, 12 is ridiculous.  You don't need to make posters out of these things.  When does it get to a point where it doesn't matter how many MPs you got?  A million?  No, come on.  Unless you're some ridiculous camera buff.  3.2 is pretty impressive on the BlackBerry, but I know I could go a little higher with  my MPs.  Five?  Five or six tops? 
[00:48:00]  After that, it's like you barely notice the difference?  Yeah.  Then it's all about just blowing it up to a certain size.  Right, right.  Then it becomes like, all right, now I need that person's eyeball.  I shot the picture from 50 yards away, and I need a crystal clear picture of his eyeball.  So you're able to zoom in and Photoshop.  Trevor's back.  Oh, he is?  I'm a catalyst to awesomeness.  Fuck you, Trevor.  What an asshole.  All right, you made us laugh.  Now go away. 
[00:48:30]  Go back to just listening.  I didn't smedicker at that comment.  No.  I didn't even fucking smirk at it.  I kind of liked it.  It stunk.  Best phone is Nextel's 580.  Everyone's still listening to phones that are better than iPhone and BlackBerry.  We don't need to take any of these calls, right?  All right, guys, whatever.  There you go.  Oh!  Oh!  What?  This will bring everyone back.  Ow, this fucking Gatorade is hurting my throat.  Why?  These pretzels are making me thirsty.  Because my throat is scratchy, and like it's got sort of an acidic thing. 
[00:49:00]  What did Gatorade do, by the way?  I wanted a Gatorade.  Their label is like, yeah, you can't even tell it's Gatorade.  I wanted a Gatorade the other day, and I got confused.  They have like five or six, you can't have that many products on the market.  I didn't know which Gatorade to get, and I got all like hot inside and confused that I went for vitamin water.  Get the Gatorade Storm.  The Gatorade bald is no good.  They have rain.  They got locale.  They got some G shit, it's called.  Yo G.  I didn't know what the fuck to buy. 
[00:49:30]  And the panic set in, so I just grabbed an orange vitamin water and said, all right, I'm done.  T-O-U-G-H.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It would be tough.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know what they're doing.  All right, Dan, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Somehow we got to bring this Whip Him Out Wednesday back, maybe through Twitter.  I don't know.  We got to do something.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to.  It's not good weather.  I can't believe no one else is talking about this yet.  Go to www.tdd.com. 
[00:50:00]  www.tdd, right?  That's our favorite.  What would tylerdurton do.com?  Yeah.  No, I'm not talking about Christina Aguilera.  Keep going slowly.  Slowly.  There you go.  Hey.  There you fucking go.  That's from a while ago, though.  Who gives a shit?  It's back up on www.tdd.com.  Megan Fox Topless.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing nude pasties, though. 
[00:50:30]  God, she has great tits.  Oh, she's wearing nude pasties.  What great tits.  What are you waiting for?  Hit next.  God, she has great tits.  Huh?  Wow, I want to hold them.  Huh?  Big fucking heavy C's, right?  You want to just get the weighty feeling?  Big teardrop tits.  They look weighty and firm and warm.  Jesus Christ.  There you go.  Wow.  That's what I do for everybody today.  There you go.  Are they really old?  This is the first time I'm seeing them. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, this is fun.  Probably from about a year ago.  He's reposting because...  Why wouldn't he?  Oh, you know why?  Because I think the Daily News, for some reason, I guess, never heard of these before.  And so, like, they were making a big deal out of it.  So he just decided...  Oh, okay.  The Daily News posting the Miley Cyrus pictures?  The newspapers...  Article.  Newspapers are so...  Article.  They're so behind.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  By the way, me and Megan Fox have something in common.  Oh?  Don't talk about my man boobs.  It's not my boobs.  I wasn't going to say anything.  It's...  We both have the thumb defect. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, the short thumb?  Yeah, I got the Megan Fox birth defect that they've been exploiting lately on the internet.  Hey, Rock, what are you bringing in today?  Bubonic plague?  Oh, shit, E-Rock.  Thank you.  Are you still coughing?  A little bit, yeah.  Stop it!  Why aren't you?  Where's it?  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  All right.  So, check out the Megan Fox pictures on whatwouldtylerderdendo.com, www.tdd.com.  Typhoid dummy.  It's beautiful.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  For Trevor.  Oh.  For Trevor.  For Trevor.  There's a man who pedals into danger If you eat Chinese food, this guy's no stranger  He's weaving down the block What you want to be for pork  The man will risk his life To bring you egg rolls 
[00:52:30]  Little Asian man  Little Asian man  He may just get run over While bringing you lo mein  His bike's a piece of crap His basket's rusted  That's what one time said  The seat is wrapped in tape The brakes are busted 
[00:53:00]  He used his shoes to stop That's when he hit that cop  Who still finds bits of rice Inside his holster  Little Asian man  Little Asian man  He may just get run over While bringing you lo mein  That's really not bad at all, man. 
[00:53:30]  No, it's good.  There you go.  You got to understand the delivery guys in New York, though.  That was a local bit.  Yeah, that was local.  I don't think they can understand that one in Montana.  Yeah, because everywhere you go in New York...  See, Trevor, we're also a national show.  We got to, like, mix it up a little bit here.  I'm laughing because there's some other ones on this.  E-Rock just handed me an old-school disc.  Remember Klee Motors? 
[00:54:00]  I don't feel like breaking you.  Let's continue.  Klee Motors.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  Hey, I hope you get the joke.  Here it comes, shoved right in your face.  I don't get that.  I don't know.  You don't know Klee Motors?  Nope.  I want to hear it.  You know, where this was very popular with morning shows where you come up with a business  that has an unusual name, so then you could fit in a lot of double entendre jokes.  Right.  It's Opie and Anthony and Spaz and... 
[00:54:30]  Oh, no, no.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  That is going back.  That's Spaz and Dottie.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that was a good one.  We could play that going in a break.  That was a good one.  Actually, we will play that going in a break, but first, Klee Motors.  Oh, no.  Listen to this.  Oh, no.  Hi, I'm Ed Klee, owner of Klee Motors, home of the Klee Jeep, Klee Volvo, and the Klee Taurus.  Let's see.  Get it?  Get it?  Did you...  Did you get it? 
[00:55:00]  You want to hear the whole thing?  Of course.  Okay.  Hi, I'm Ed Klee, owner of Klee Motors, home of the Klee Jeep, Klee Volvo, and the Klee Taurus.  Let's see what some of our satisfied women owners have to say about their Klee Taurus.  I just love my Klee Taurus.  Hey, who wouldn't?  When I need to get away, I lean back and get lost in my Klee Taurus.  Many women say that a Klee Taurus is easy to maintain. 
[00:55:30]  Here to tell you about the easy maintenance of a Klee Taurus is crack mechanic Michael Hunt.  Because your Klee Taurus is so sensitive, we recommend that you have it looked at and  serviced at least once every three months.  If not lubed up regularly, your parts are going to get gummed up and they won't work.  And hey, that stinks.  Thanks, Mike.  The guys at Klee Motors are always eager to not only service my Klee Taurus, but it's  the fact that they take the time to polish it and buff it to a spit shine. 
[00:56:00]  The problem with this thing is you could have done all the jokes in 20 seconds.  Right.  This is a two-minute bit.  Yeah.  We only have done.  That keeps me coming back.  Thanks, Ed.  That's what I'm...  Who would go back to a car dealership and say it keeps me coming back because they buffed  my car right?  Right.  Well, it's her Klee Taurus.  Well, but you know, you're supposed to be talking about the car, you see.  But she's talking about her clit.  But you, as the listener, you're supposed to sit there at home and go, wow. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, clever.  Yes.  Very clever.  Thanks, Ed.  That's what I'm here for.  It was our anniversary, and my husband wanted to get me an unforgettable surprise.  I surged and surged, and admittedly, I had a little trouble finding it.  Imagine my excitement when he finally came across my Klee Taurus.  Thanks, Ed.  Don't thank me.  Thank my staff for looks and feel you can't lick a Klee Taurus.  I don't drive my Klee Taurus.  It drives me wild. 
[00:57:00]  A Klee Taurus is hard to find, but it is worth the effort.  Let me, Ed Klee, help you find your Klee Taurus.  Today, at Klee Motors, off of Route 69, you'll find us right next to Cox Liquors.  You don't fucking say the name of the dealership before the car.  Why are you getting mad?  We're having fun.  That stunk.  Fucking, I bought my, I lease, I don't buy it from Park Avenue, BMW, New Jersey. 
[00:57:30]  I don't say, I'm going to drive my Park Avenue, G, you don't say that.  My Klee Taurus.  Safe to say we didn't do that one.  You want another one from this old school disc game?  Please, I need, I need to hear these.  We got Popeye, we got sounds of pooping.  The sounds of pooping was pretty, pretty good.  Wasn't this Brian Unger when he used to do our show?  Yeah, it was.  As we leave you on this Sunday morning, here's me taking a big poop. 
[00:58:00]  Sometimes a poop is a good thing on a Sunday morning.  Something you'd like to share with your neighbors, your friends.  Here's me and the sounds of dumping.  Oftentimes we don't have time to show you the poop.  Today, here's me taking a dump, and then me showing it to you. 
[00:58:30]  Oftentimes we like to leave our viewers with a little something from the outside.  Today, it's me taking a poop.  Here's me running to the outhouse to take a big old hairy.  And as we leave you on this Sunday morning, the sounds of pooping. 
[00:59:00]  Because there's nothing better than a good poop.  Yeah.  See, you get it?  He's pooping.  And farting.  Yeah.  Taking a big old hairy.  We're almost done with this disc.  It's fantastic.  This is just for one guy today.  Dry, dry, dry vagina. 
[00:59:30]  Ah, yes.  Dry, dry, dry vagina.  So, before my penis starts to get sore.  Come pick up some badger lube at your local drugstore.  Said, go get some badger lube at your local drugstore. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, you stink, baby.  That's funny.  Were you able to play that on Terrestrial?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All these.  Yep.  All these you can't play anymore.  Dude, you couldn't play any of that.  No.  Dry vagina?  Regular radio fucking stinks.  You couldn't play dry vagina.  You couldn't play that Asian bit.  You couldn't even do the pooping bit anymore.  The big old hairy.  No, you're right.  No.  All the bits we just played, even the Klee motors, can't play it.  Klee tariff.  These were all played on regular radio and no one gave us a problem. 
[01:00:30]  Ugh.  Bunch of cunty lawyers.  They just destroy everything.  Oh, boy do they, Jimmy.  Boy do they.  Fucking bunch of no-talent wannabes sitting behind desks.  Yuck.  Yuck.  And yuck.  Any other good ones on there?  Well.  Good ones.  That's funny.  That dry vagina is great.  Oh, yeah.  The Rudy rap.  Lord comb over.  Those are way too old for people.  Porno.  Run around.  I love that one.  Land of Misfits.  Sex toys.  Hillary and Chelsea in Africa.  Oh, shit. 
[01:01:00]  You know.  Let's hear that one.  I don't remember that one.  We actually.  This is when we're still writing bits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some of the gold we don't do anymore.  We thought it was so good.  This is going to be douche chilly, I think.  Could be.  We thought this bit was so good, we did two of them.  Wow.  A series.  Oh, shit.  Mom, are these people cannibals?  See.  Oh, okay. 
[01:01:30]  Now I'm remembering.  See.  Hillary went to Africa with her daughter, Chelsea.  Yes, with Chelsea.  Yeah.  And we thought it was going to sound something like that.  And, oh, my God.  Yeah, this.  It's bad.  Mom, are these people cannibals?  Now, now, Chelsea.  Why would you say that?  Because the chief said he'd give anything to eat me.  Oh, no.  He sounds a lot like your father.  What the fuck is that? 
[01:02:00]  Why is she talking with an English accent?  Because we didn't know anyone that could do those voices.  So we're like, you know what?  Let's just pitch ourselves up.  Let's just pitch it up.  But why?  I'm playing the part of Chelsea.  And Anthony's playing the part of Hillary.  But why the English accent?  I don't understand what's going on.  Here's some of the great stuff that was in between all the stuff you fucking wrote on Instant Feedback. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  Eat me!  He sounds a lot like your father.  Your mother, Hillary, is very respected here.  She has the one quality that is most coveted in our village.  What's that?  Wisdom?  Compassion?  No, a fat white ass.  Oh, well.  Your African name, Chelsea, is Kiala Abelafu.  That's beautiful. 
[01:03:00]  What does it mean?  Lanky pale girl with face of a wombat.  Oh.  Oh.  Making fun of, uh...  Hey, Mom!  Mandingo wants me to go into the forest with him!  I think he's gonna let me have one of his pets!  Why do you think that, Chelsea?  Because he said he's gonna give me his 12-inch Ubangi Black Snake!  Jesus Christ!  Oh, it's beautiful out here, Mandingo!  By the way, what does your name mean?  It means man with three legs.  But you only have two legs! 
[01:03:30]  Oh, really?  Wow!  Chelsea, when we are through tonight, the whole village will call you Iwachalakanaya.  Neat!  What does it mean?  That means she who cannot sit for weeks.  Ooh!  Now grab your ankles, Chelsea, and I will demonstrate what your father does to your countrymen.  Oh, my God!  Oh, no!  Oh, oh, shit!  Oh, oh, oh!  Put it away!  Put it away!  Holy shit is all I have to say. 
[01:04:00]  And Letterman got in trouble?  Yeah.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  She's pretty much being raped by an African.  Yeah, that's 11 years old.  Holy shit!  See, radio used to be very different.  Man, how were we able to adjust?  How the fuck were we able to adjust?  You couldn't play that now?  I don't know.  Well, you wouldn't want to.  Right.  It's safe because it's 10, 11 years ago.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Holy crap.  Not, not a, not one complaint, nothing.  No.  No one had a problem.  No one was listening.  They turned it off the first fucking English accent, Hillary, they heard.  You want part two?  Oh, no.  More fucking blatant hack jokes.  Oh, Mandingo!  It's so big!  I need two hands to hold it!  Ah, that's it, Chelsea.  Now wrap your lips around it.  Wrap this?  Yes, that's...  Come on.  Why is she blowing Darth Vader? 
[01:05:00]  Was that pointed out?  Yes.  Oh, I wasn't listening.  It's not like Mufasa.  What the fuck?  It's the Lion King.  It's bits like this you realize, wow.  Yeah.  Regular radio now sucks.  This is exactly what got regular radio.  I don't even think you could do this on satellite radio if this was a current news story.  Oh, I know.  Your lips around it.  Like this?  Yes, that's it.  Now blow, Chelsea.  Blow. 
[01:05:30]  Nothing's coming out.  Oh, be patient, Chelsea.  And blow harder.  Bullseye.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wow, thanks for showing me how to use your blowgun, Mandingo.  Of course.  See, we flipped it.  See?  See?  She wasn't sucking his cock.  Yeah, see?  She was actually using the...  Wow.  Show me how to use your blowgun, Mandingo.  Anytime, Chelsea.  We best go back to the village and find your mother. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, no.  I wonder where she is.  Maybe she's in this hut.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Mom, what are you doing with Mandingo's sister?  Oh, dear.  You said you were going on a safari.  No, no.  I said before the day ends, I want to be deep in the bush.  Well, you do what you want.  I'm going to help Mandingo take care of a bad animal.  What are you talking about, Chelsea?  He wants me to spank his monkey.  Oh, no.  We'll just be back in time for dinner. 
[01:06:30]  Okay.  Well, what are we having?  I don't know about you, but I'll be having the African beaver.  Okay, look.  Look, I feel all hot.  Why?  That was a good one.  And...  And...  I'm sorry, Trevor.  You were right.  The monkey needed to be spanked.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it was very bad.  Why wouldn't the mother let her daughter go into the woods with a strange black warrior to discipline a primate?  How did people like the show? 
[01:07:00]  I don't know.  Sometimes I wonder that myself, my friend.  But radio must have really been bad.  Not only do they like it, they were eating this up.  Oh, I know.  Couldn't get enough.  Like African beaver.  So we basically said that she's a lesbo.  And we had pedo stuff.  Yeah.  And no one 10 years ago had a problem with this.  None at all.  Unbelievable.  See, we're too sensitive now.  Wow. 
[01:07:30]  Then we move on.  Bob Hope in Space.  Monster Douche.  Yoshi Viagra.  Flying Chicken.  We did that one.  Yeah, of course.  Cock.  Oh, God.  Another hacky fucking play on words.  We have to play Cock.  We're almost done.  Of course.  We're almost done.  Listen for the double entendre.  Oh, yeah.  We're all about that.  Hello, miss.  I'm an elderly woman. 
[01:08:00]  I just moved here from Boston, Massachusetts.  And I have a leaky bathtub.  Uh-huh.  I believe I need Cock to fill in the hole.  You need pardon me?  I need Cock.  Okay, please hold.  Thank you for holding.  We will be with you shortly.  Hello?  Yes, I'm in desperate need of Cock.  The old Cock just ain't working anymore.  Okay.  Over in the paint department, they have GE silicone they got for that.  Is that good Cock?  Sure is.  And that works good in the bathtub? 
[01:08:30]  Sure does.  Could I speak to someone in the paint department?  Sure.  Hold on one second.  You can call my Cock.  Hello, miss.  I need Cock.  You need Cork?  No, I need Cock.  If I needed Cock, I would have said Cock.  Clark.  Does he supply the Cock?  Can you spell this for me?  C-A-U-L-K.  Cock.  Please hold.  Hello?  State department.  Hi, I need Cock.  Huh?  I need Cock.  Clark?  Cock. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah?  I need Cock.  Because I own a house now, and all the Cock in my house is all dried up.  Okay.  I need some brand new Cock.  You carry Cock?  You need Cock?  Yes.  I need Cock for my Bob tub.  What kind?  What kind of color are you looking for?  I don't really care.  I like white Cock, but I'll take any color.  The Cock that's in my house is all dried and cracked.  And it's leaky Cock.  I need new Cock. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  Well, we got all sorts of shapes and varieties here on Cock for you.  All kinds of shapes of Cock?  Oh, yeah.  We even have one that's about two feet long.  Really, darling?  Yeah.  Well, that's a lot of Cock.  Yeah.  I probably could use that much.  Yeah, a lot of people could.  Thank you, sir.  You've been very kind.  Also, we have some special guns to attach to the Cock, you know.  Get a little more width there.  Cock?  Gun?  Yep.  Oh, that sounds very exciting.  I'll have to come down.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  We got plenty for you.  Thank you very much.  And if you don't see anything on the shelf you like, some of our employees have their own  that they give to you.  Their own special brand of Cock?  Oh, yeah.  That's wonderful, darling.  We do everything for you here.  Thank you very much, son.  We even send someone over to your house sometimes to help you use it.  To help me install the Cock?  Yep.  They'll install it for you real nice.  Somebody could help me put the Cock in, really.  That's right.  That's wonderful.  I get it.  All right.  So you have a good day, man.  Thank you, son.  Bye.  Do you just get annoyed hearing these old bits? 
[01:10:30]  The thing is, the one thing I found really funny on that was just the way the guy finally  goes, you want Cock?  You need Cock?  You need Cock?  We laughed about that guy for quite some time.  You need Cock?  Going back to the Chelsea Hillary bit.  Yeah.  D-Law.  I can't get to his phone call because we really need a break.  He writes, why would a tribesman have a zipper?  You know, in all the years, I don't think we've ever picked up on that one. 
[01:11:00]  Why would he?  So I could...  Because the flopping of the big cock would have worked no matter what.  You didn't need the zipper ahead of time.  Oh, is that funny?  Let me say hi to Greg on Long Island.  Greg?  Greg?  Yeah, hi.  I'm going to say this very vague so nobody will get upset.  But the reason we, the fans, were eating this up and still are is because your competitor  was still goofing on Gary's teeth. 
[01:11:30]  I guess we're getting a little bored with that.  Yeah, it was new and different, right?  Right.  We continue to be new and different.  You still are.  Thank you, sir.  Thank God we're different from that.  All right, we should take a break.  Listen, Jim Norton on Red Eye.  What do you call it, a little mistake?  It's a slip of the tongue.  A slip of the tongue in front of a national audience?  Somebody asked me a question.  I just answered.  It has something to do with Anthony?  It's all the talk today.  I have a feeling it's at my expense.  I don't remember. 
[01:12:00]  But you said earlier it's just a little mistake.  Oh, did I?  It must have been an error.  I think it's a huge mistake.  It might have been a slight error.  I made a booboo.  We should just do this as we do national TV.  Just throw each other under the bus?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, well.  We got that after the break.  We got Andy Rooney has an opinion about shoes.  Oh.  We have Jack Black cursing on Letterman, and it wasn't beeped out.  Oh, no.  He's dangerous.  He's a wild one.  What movie is he promoting now? 
[01:12:30]  That's got to be year one.  That's got to be good.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Yeah.  He makes the funny eyes.  I can't wait to get Jack Black in the studio again.  It'll be for some shitty project, and trust me, I'll make sure he knows that.  Oh, I'm going to come in for this one, I imagine.  He blew us off.  What did he?  Oh, it was the publicist.  Some of these guys have to take responsibility and understand, you know, what shows have been there from the beginning.  Yeah.  You know, Jack Black came in from the beginning to promote everything, and then something happened where he only started coming in to promote really bad things that weren't going to fly, and now he's not coming in at all. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  And then they blamed the publicist.  That's bullshit.  You've got to understand who was there for you in the beginning.  David Letterman addresses the Fire Letterman rally that was outside his studio.  Sam was down there.  He's got audio, so we're going to do that as well.  Not a very big demonstration, I hear.  We'll get into some current stuff after the break, but first, one more, Ant. 
[01:13:30]  Spaz and Dottie, because we played a little snippet of that.  Oh, yes.  I think it's self-explanatory, hopefully.  We'll go to break with this today.  It's Opie and Anthony and Spaz and Dottie.  5'2", 243 pounds.  Spaz will be changing Dottie's tampon.  I want people to remember, Spaz is blindfolded at this point, because we wanted the reaction  when he takes the blindfold off and gets to see Dottie completely naked on the toilet spread eagle. 
[01:14:00]  Okay, Rick is in the bathroom, Rick.  We are here in our 4x4 toilet bathroom.  Okay.  All right, now make your way in front here.  All right.  Kneel him down.  I want to count down.  Don't worry.  Jesus Christ.  Look, she's trying to comfort him.  He's a little nervous.  All right, right now she's positioning him right in front.  Come on, keep going.  Right in front.  Very close.  Positioning him right in front.  That's it.  Got his hand on her thigh.  Okay.  All right, Spaz, don't move yet.  On our count, Rick, okay?  On our count, we are going to lift off the blindfold. 
[01:14:30]  Ready?  One, two, three.  Pull it off.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, my God.  Get off the toilet.  You can't handle it.  Put the blindfold on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Don't puke, dude.  If you get sick, I'm going to kick your ass. 
[01:15:00]  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  We got a lot of new audio.  We should wrap up the whole David Letterman thing.  He apologized.  I think he saved face.  I wish he didn't have to apologize, but in this day and age, you've got to apologize if you want to keep your job.  Yeah.  It was smart.  It was a smart move.  We all understand that.  Jamie Foxx said he was sorry, and it went away. 
[01:15:30]  Like, it's smart sometimes to say he's sorry.  He wasn't sorry either.  Probably not, no.  I'm not sorry.  These are fake apologies.  Oh, Rich.  I'm not talking for Letterman.  I just assume it's got to be another fake apology, because that's what they demand out there.  Yep.  They demand an apology, so you come up with a fake apology, and then the person accepts the fake apology, like Sarah Palin did.  She bought it hook, line, and sinker, the fake apology.  Yeah.  It's great.  Insincerity is fine, as long as you say it. 
[01:16:00]  It doesn't matter if you mean it or not.  Even if you make a mistake.  Rich Voss in studio.  And the password is.  Wow.  It's kind of cool to see the guy and the producer.  The guy making the project, the producer of the project, together in the same room.  It's, you know, and we're on speaking terms.  Everything's going well.  You know, we've been shooting for four hours.  Of course.  You know, we had a big shoot yesterday.  I bought the snacks.  I bought some chips. 
[01:16:30]  We, we, no, you, yeah, you shot at the comics yesterday.  I stopped in to take a look.  The project has potential, to be honest with you.  Make sure everything was, you know, on the.  Yeah, it's kind of a cool job.  You just show up and everyone gets nervous.  Oh, the producer's here.  People are actually getting nervous because they showed up.  I'm like, if you only knew.  I'm such a dope.  The baby hid.  Yeah.  By the way, I thought, I thought he was talking about what we did after the shoot. 
[01:17:00]  My little YouTube video.  How did that turn out?  Yeah, it was all right.  Yeah.  Where's the cameras today, you bag of shit?  How about putting your friends in the project?  What's the matter with you?  First of all, friends.  What's the matter with you?  Friends call friends back.  But first of all, let me explain.  I know.  I've been saying for the last four years.  But here's the thing.  We haven't decided.  We haven't even gotten to this level yet.  Yeah, we haven't decided if you guys are in the movie yet.  It's between you and Artie Lang, so I'm trying to weigh things out.  No, we haven't got to this level yet.  What do we decide on Ann?  Is he in or what?  Oh, yeah.  But he has to wear pure Nazi attire. 
[01:17:30]  All righty.  Don't have to bother wardrobe.  Catch him right before bedtime.  That's what he sleeps in.  It's a stocking cap with an SS on it.  I think the project has potential.  People are confused because in the paper it said women.  Funny women.  Funny women or something.  They have no clue what they're in search of.  Which is a contradiction.  In search of.  They have no clue of the angle that is being taken with this project.  The footage is like the Sasquatch running in the woods in 67. 
[01:18:00]  I think that was her.  Nope.  Bonnie actually is a very good interviewer.  I was very surprised.  Yeah, I gave her a pep talk.  No, it was all her.  You have no idea.  Because I complimented Bonnie and all of a sudden Richard goes, well, I'm not that bad either.  I'm like, could you just let me compliment your wife without you needing a compliment right away?  No, first of all, you know, this fly-by-night producer comes in and then he says, Bonnie has it.  As you sat me down and begged me to get involved, shut up. 
[01:18:30]  Bonnie says.  I know if we get you or Anthony or both of you, we'll make the paper with this.  We got, it was in the back page.  It was almost in the next day's paper.  I quit.  No, you're back in.  Wow.  See?  Quitting as a producer?  I'm leaving the project.  Get that in the paper, how it's just an on-again, off-again relationship.  Bonnie, he's there.  He's like, Bonnie has a great idea here. 
[01:19:00]  Well, a lot of it is my idea.  That's what it was.  I go, Bonnie's onto something here.  Well, I can't get pushed out of my own project.  It's been done throughout my life.  It's Bonnie's project for the most part.  No.  It's Bonnie's.  See?  It's Bonnie's idea.  We're just fitting you in to make you happy.  The project doesn't need you.  Matter of fact, you're fired.  I don't need you.  Give me my 400 I put up yesterday.  All of a sudden, I'm going to say, no, no, I don't want it.  You know what?  That's a great investment. 
[01:19:30]  How much?  I'll give you 500.  Get lost.  Go play golf.  I saw a Bonnie interview for, I don't know, maybe an hour yesterday.  I'm like, God damn, we don't need Rich anymore.  What's the project about?  Rich, you were babysitting yesterday.  Basically.  He was running around.  When we filmed our stuff, it was really funny yesterday.  What's the project about?  Are women funny?  Is it a question like that?  It's pretty much a question.  With a few more little...  Jesus, Rich, everyone heard that. 
[01:20:00]  No.  Yes, you can't just cover up a mic and assume that's...  Yeah, because my mic's still on, you fucking zilch.  Then it leans towards Jimmy's mic.  Let me cover mine up, and then I'll go over here.  What do you think?  My mic turns off as a courtesy?  Here's an experiment.  My mic is completely covered.  Can you still hear me?  No.  You dicks.  Whatever.  So, but this thing's going to be big.  Of course, when we get to this level, you know, yesterday we had, you know, a couple  comics that, you know, we got to work our way up. 
[01:20:30]  We're going to do some filming next week.  We're going to try to do Patrice in his house while he cooks us a vegan meal with an apron.  You know, so it's going to...  I think this is going to be big.  I really think this is going to...  How about putting your old friend in it?  You're going to have a very big part.  I hate to break the news to you.  I hate to hear it.  All the things I could have landed.  What's my part going to be? 
[01:21:00]  Is it going to be small?  No.  Are you lying?  No.  I want to be in the movie.  You're going to be in the movie as long as you don't overact like you just did now.  I'm a very good actor.  Yeah, Jimmy's all right.  I want to do a scene with Jimmy.  I want to audition him.  If it's done right, I think it could do very well.  But let's move on.  Look at that.  I think.  Well, the producer wants to give it a little hush-hush right now.  He had a nice clipboard, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, his clipboard was nice. 
[01:21:30]  His notes...  You have a bullhorn?  All right, everybody.  That seems like Burke Dennings in The Exorcist.  Get your cunting wife over there.  Voss, I need your social security number.  Your social...  Can you give it to me, please?  For tax purposes.  326-70...  Don't do it on the fucking air.  You're joking, right?  You're not that dumb.  Do you really just speak?  Yes.  Yes.  We do think.  Yes, mister.  I gave out my password last time I was here. 
[01:22:00]  Thank you.  Exactly.  Why am I working with you?  What'd you get, Rich?  I got oatmeal.  Oh, okay.  And this guy's shaking all by me.  It's shooken up.  Oh, that's Michael Moore's son.  Leave him alone.  Oh.  Tinty Moore.  What's up?  All right, that's pretty good, Rich.  Tinty Moore.  Our video did all right.  It's on YouTube.  Opie Radio is my channel, but...  It was more of a Zanel video, because now I'm organizing my videos. 
[01:22:30]  Are you?  If they're just basic, here I am in the street, take a look at me or who I'm hanging with,  then it goes on Zanel.  If I'm trying to get something that might be a little more polished and entertaining,  then it goes on YouTube.  But fucking Zanel won't allow you to upload big videos.  100 MB, that's it, A.  That's it?  And I got the HD.  Yeah.  And actually, I got the brand new Ultra HD Flip.  Did you get that one?  Fuck yeah.  What's the difference?  It's a little heavier, right?  Yeah, that's the problem.  But is it better? 
[01:23:00]  Does it stabilize a little better?  Yeah.  Oh, let me say it.  All that.  No, no, this is my...  Well, what the fuck?  I'll bring it in tomorrow, but the problem is...  Yeah, bring it in tomorrow.  It's like twice as thick.  It is very thick.  I saw it at the store.  How much...  My original Flip, Minnow HD, is awesome because you can throw it in your pocket.  You don't even know you have it on you.  I got mine with me all the time.  The other one is too thick and a little too heavy.  How long of a video, though?  Just so the quality's a little better.  Double, two hours instead of an hour?  That's fucking...  That right there makes it worth it to buy it.  Yeah, but I never fill up an hour on my Flip.  Oh, dude, I go through an hour immediately because I tape a couple of sets and all of a sudden 
[01:23:30]  I got no time left.  Oh, well, you tape the sets.  And I'm like, what the fudge?  No, that's perfect.  That's perfect for that type of...  It's a little too heavy yet and a little too...  But I like it.  It's probably good to carry around in your bag or something like that, though.  That's great for your pocket and just to leave around.  But this is HD.  I don't need...  Is the other one HD?  Ultra, it's called.  Yeah, okay.  What is Ultra HD compared to HD?  It's more Ultra-like.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I was thinking.  I don't know.  I got to research that phone a little bit.  Danny's a tech guy. 
[01:24:00]  But I'm in touch with the Xano people.  They're very excited that we're using their technology.  And I'm like, all right, if you're excited, let me fucking upload a bigger file.  Oh, believe me.  My Rich Voss video was a minute 20.  Yesterday, it was 104.  That's it.  I was just over the limit.  You're just over.  But they're like 100 or we don't upload.  You have to clip it.  You have to cut it down a little bit.  I couldn't clip it anywhere.  Compress it?  You might have to show me the...  I'm still learning this shit.  You can compress that.  They got some pretty good compression there.  All right.  You'll still look good. 
[01:24:30]  David Letterman addresses the fire Letterman rally outside his studio.  So yesterday, I guess, was the last day with the Sarah Palin controversy, right?  Yeah.  And Letterman had some fun with it.  People outside his studio trying to get him fun.  And all these people, by the way, saying, you know, these lawyers go,  don't talk about it like when something like this is happening.  And Letterman was smart, man.  He was smart.  Very nice of you.  Thank you very much.  Welcome to the Late Show, ladies and gentlemen.  Now, when I call your name, please come forward and pick up your apology. 
[01:25:00]  I want to get through this as quickly as possible so you folks can get to the Fire Dave rally.  Wow.  It's nice that people hate me who are no longer just part of my immediate family. 
[01:25:30]  You know, it's...  My son, you know, he's telling everybody at school that his father is Conan.  I...  How does that make me...  Yeah, there's a Fire Dave rally going on outside, but I think it's just about over  because the last time I looked, they were breaking up and heading to Flash Dancers.  So I think it's going to be all right.  You can hear the excitement in Letterman's voice. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, he loves it.  This was good for business.  Do we have the ratings yet?  As far as the Sarah Palin controversy goes?  It was great for a show.  He's a hit.  Can I be honest with you?  Anyone here, anything from Conan last week?  It's all been Letterman and Sarah Palin.  They didn't plan it, but it worked out well.  God damn, is that...  He hijacked Conan's second week of The Tonight Show.  Amazing.  Publicity-wise.  And he looks good.  Letterman looks good, even though he had to apologize, right?  I don't think he looked bad apologizing at all. 
[01:26:30]  He doesn't look bad.  Legitimately, she was 14, even though we know he didn't mean it.  That doesn't sound good.  She was 14.  He didn't mean it.  No, no, but you...  Roman Polanski?  You know he didn't mean to say that, but there are times...  Yeah.  I said this on Red Eye last night.  Brilliantly.  But no, sometimes it's like...  There are times in life where you're apologizing, and it doesn't mean you're a groveling worm.  It's okay to say you're sorry once in a while.  Especially comparing Red Eye at four in the morning to Letterman, but what I want to know is...  I really wasn't, I was just kind of kidding, and the words are especially, there's no exonics. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, the Dorn clip.  There's no exonics, especially.  Oh, really?  All of a sudden, now is into women's rights again.  For the last 10 years, they've only been a political activist, and now all of a sudden, they're jumping on board.  Where were they when Letterman was trashing Hillary Clinton throughout the last year or so, or Leno, or any of them?  So, do you have that clip from last night?  Well, isn't that a good point?  I can't be involved with you.  It's not.  Why isn't it a good point? 
[01:27:30]  I quit.  Because you're giving now too much credit.  They're like any other special interest group.  You can't look for consistency in a special interest group.  They're shitty.  Right.  They have good points, and they do good things, and the majority of their stuff is just getting themselves in the spotlight, so they're not irrelevant.  Thank you.  Well, let's focus on the good news, and the good news is,  Sarah Palin has accepted my apology.  So that's...  Yeah.  And...  She also accepted a $500 gift certificate from LensCrafters. 
[01:28:00]  I thought that was a nice touch.  And...  I'll tell you, to be honest, I was quite nervous about this whole thing,  and I was really nervous about an apology to Sarah Palin.  So what I did to get my confidence up, to get my nerves to settle down,  I rehearsed by apologizing to Tina Fey.  That helped.  That was a big help.  He is.  What?  Fucking hilarious. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  He's firing on all cylinders.  Dude, he has...  I'd say Letterman has more balls than I ever realized he had.  He is...  Because the vice...  A vice presidential candidate, instead of just shutting up about it,  which is what I would do in a fucking panic...  Yeah.  He's still making...  He's still being funny.  It's fucking great, man.  Letterman has always showed his balls when he needs to.  Wow.  You, like, apologize to most people, like,  all right, we're moving on, and then that's it.  Yeah.  Like, he's making jokes about it.  Sure.  And it makes him look better, yeah.  Protester walks behind Dave's desk.  Yeah, hi.  Can I help you? 
[01:29:00]  Is this the Fire David Letterman rally?  No, that's across the street,  and I know you're Joe.  You're one of the writers.  It's not here.  It's across the street.  I have to go now.  I don't want to be late.  I understand.  Okay, good luck over there.  Do you think Justin and Eric both auditioned for that?  They're rotten, lousy acting.  They couldn't get it.  Our two friends, the writers, the Stangle brothers, 
[01:29:30]  they probably fucked up.  They kept calling him Jay and Conan.  Wrong!  Bring in the other kid.  Bring in the other guy, Joe.  We have a feeling we know which guy wrote the joke.  We're not sure, but I haven't heard from those guys.  One of those two creepy brothers.  Yeah, one of the creepy brothers.  I want to know why they didn't get the acting gig.  They've been there longer.  They watch a certain basement program.  They're all in with our activities.  I've heard.  Isn't Letterman too big to even?  Like, they wouldn't even consider it. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, really?  Over something this small?  Imus went.  They didn't fire anybody.  You know how much money Imus was bringing in?  Yeah.  You know how much money we were bringing in at the time?  Yeah.  They don't give a shit about that.  And I'm not saying we're as big as Letterman.  No.  Because I'll hear that now.  But fucking, yeah, Letterman, yeah.  No one's safe in this environment anymore.  No one.  The next day, he would be scooped up by...  Maybe.  First of all, I'll say scooped up.  And second of all, he's probably going to have to sit his contract out.  Really?  Yeah, and third of all, if they go after your advertisers, and they threaten advertisers 
[01:30:30]  all across CBS's platform, and they get it rolling, and advertisers start to pull out  across CBS's empire, then they fucking feel the financial...  That's it.  That's bigger than Letterman.  As much as Letterman is as big as he is.  That's how they get you.  Yeah.  It's sickening, but I mean, that's the way it works.  It is sickening, and no one's safe, unfortunately.  That's the disadvantage to being with such a big company.  The advantage is you can make so much money.  They can put you into so many households or on so many radio stations.  But the disadvantage is when they go after you and they threaten the advertisers, the 
[01:31:00]  company has that much more money to lose.  You're smaller.  And it's deep, too, because with radio, a company owned a radio station or whatever, now it's  like a corporate umbrella.  Not only are they going after the radio advertising, they're going after Blockbuster and Nickelodeon  or whatever the fuck the properties are owned by the company.  Whatever they own these days.  They go after every single thing that your company's involved with.  It's ugly.  Top ten list.  The category tonight, wow, talk about something pretty close to home. 
[01:31:30]  The category tonight, top ten things overheard at the fire David Letterman rally.  Going on right now, and we sent, and I don't want to give away any secrets, but we sent in  a mole, was over there and was able to listen to the things that were being said and collate  them and come back with the top ten things being said at the fire David Letterman rally.  Here we go.  Number ten.  David who?  Right. 
[01:32:00]  Number nine.  Well, it was nice to CBS to provide the catering.  What?  What?  Number eight.  We should have done this years ago.  Number seven.  What idiot turned Broadway into a pedestrian mall?  Number six.  Number six.  Isn't there always a crowd demanding Letterman be fired?  Number five.  March around the potholes, people.  Number four.  Can we also get CBS to bring back gun smoke? 
[01:32:30]  Number three.  When does Cheney get here with the waterboarding gear?  What?  Oh, my God.  Look out.  Number two.  He should apologize for that hairpiece.  That's what he...  And the number one thing overheard at the fire David Letterman rally.  Thanks for coming, Regis.  Not bad.  Yeah.  I love the fact that he's addressing it.  Yeah.  Well, it leads to Sam. 
[01:33:00]  Sam was out there at the fire David Letterman.  Rally.  Uh, let me see if...  He'll be running down the hall.  Is he going to run down the hall?  Because there's nothing that gives me more joy than...  Oh, he was already outside the door.  He was outside.  Do you like to see him running?  That duck-footed idiot.  He really is a fucking...  Running down the hallway.  Quack.  Quack.  Quack.  Quack.  Quack.  Quack.  Quack.  This is going to end with Eastside Dave.  I'm hearing Eastside Dave made Access Hollywood, the Village Voice.  Look, Eastside Dave made Access Hollywood big. 
[01:33:30]  He really did?  Yeah, but that's a big deal.  They showed him with his sign.  I made...  I would like to make this announcement that...  Wait, wait.  Eastside Dave isn't talking?  No, he's not talking.  It was just him and his sign?  No.  It's not a big deal.  What did the sign say?  I am a right-wing nut.  That's very funny.  That's fucking...  Goddamn.  What an asshole.  I love it.  Before we get all carried away, I would like to make the announcement that Mr. Norton was  not the only one in the room who was on Fox News last night.  Huh?  Because primetime Sam Roberts was also on Fox News. 
[01:34:00]  So take that, Access Hollywood.  Don't blink.  What do you mean blink?  I said don't blink.  You'll miss you.  Fox News is doing a worst hairpiece segment now?  It's not a hairpiece.  It's my actual hair.  It doesn't even look like a hairpiece.  What the fuck?  Well, that wasn't that bad.  No, it was beyond...  It was four levels below horrendous.  It's the complete opposite of a hairpiece.  Yes.  Well, you know what I mean.  The way your hair is done.  Well, we're not supposed to have to figure out what you mean.  His hair looks like fucking General Urso's hat. 
[01:34:30]  Fucking Planet of the Apes.  Is that who his name is?  Fox.  I want you to leave the studio and start over.  Okay.  That sounds good.  I had a couple good lines already, though.  I had one or two.  You go outside, and you knock on the door and tell us when you're ready to start over.  Okay?  There goes Voss.  He just made a hairpiece joke.  He doesn't know.  He's nervous.  Your hairpiece.  All right.  Voss is outside the studio.  When he's ready to come back and start over, he'll knock.  Okay.  What's the haps?  Yes, Sam.  No, Voss is not... 
[01:35:00]  Wait.  You're knocking already?  You're ready already?  Oh, look at that.  Listen, let me explain something.  Very fast regrouping.  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  You know what?  You fall off the ladder, you get right back on.  Ladder.  All right.  I'll start again.  And a horse?  Who the fuck?  Oh, if he tripped and broke his big teeth.  Oh, would that be great?  Rich, what is that fucking...  What is that device you have?  What device?  That's not mine.  Okay.  What is it?  It's a timer.  It's a timer.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Throw some for your heart.  There's me.  Look on Danny's screen.  That's Sam on Fox News. 
[01:35:30]  Where?  Oh, you're in the background there.  Oh, wow.  You're on the background of a news channel.  Suck it, Access Hollywood.  Suck it.  Fox News.  Well, see, when our listeners do it, they've got a nice sign or something.  Yeah.  Look, no one even knows that you're part of our show.  My hoodie says Sirius on it.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, wow.  How about an Opie and Anthony hoodie?  Exactly.  They didn't give us any Opie and Anthony hoodies.  Why would they?  Of course not.  Why would they?  They don't exist.  What are those bright lights down the hall?  For real.  Hopefully we're all dead.  Are they filming something down the hall or is that the sun reflecting off buildings? 
[01:36:00]  It actually probably is the sun and we have no idea what it's like.  It's Carol Ann.  This is my grapefruit.  I wish it was a grenade so I could pull the pin and hold it and hug you.  You did not just make a poltergeist reference.  Oh, really?  That's a good one.  Yes. 
[01:36:30]  Where else can you say don't look into the light, you know?  Do we have Sam, primetime Sam Roberts?  Yeah, thank you, Jimmy.  Jimmy's just moving right along now.  I was in shock.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I was in shock.  So you're out there talking to the people that want Letterman fired.  Yeah, I wanted to get to know the people and maybe see if they could sway my judgment,  see where they were coming from.  We meet Patty.  Yeah, not our Patty.  No, no, no.  Oh, I was going to say.  Okay.  We're here with Patty at the David Letterman protest. 
[01:37:00]  Patty, what's the haps?  I'm here to protest David Letterman's joking about rape.  Sounds a little like Patty.  It sounds like Patty.  Sounds a little like, but a little different.  Joke.  Joke about rape.  Yeah.  They hate rape there.  Wasn't it a joke about rape, you dumb old cunt?  Well, I brought that up in more polite words.  Oh, okay.  We're here with Patty at the David Letterman protest.  Patty, what's the haps?  I'm here to protest David Letterman's joking about rape. 
[01:37:30]  Makes an excuse that it's okay because she was 18 years old.  He was raping about an 18-year-old.  In my mind, when you're 14 years old, you're 18 years old or you're 40 years old, you don't joke about rape.  But if the young lady was 18, then doesn't that make it not rape if she was impregnated necessarily?  In my mind, it makes it rape.  At any age, you're not getting the point.  Just because she's 18, she's raped doesn't mean it's rape. 
[01:38:00]  She loves to say rape.  It's rape.  Well, he didn't technically say rape.  He just said that she got knocked up.  She got knocked up.  Knocked up is a term of consideration of rape.  Holy lunatics.  She's great.  I love her.  She's really hot.  What a fucking lunatic.  What a classic.  Travis brought up the good point, wondering if she'd seen the Judd Apatow movie, Raped.  Raped.  Rape.  And it's something to do with rape. 
[01:38:30]  Letterman never implied rape.  Knocked up means rape.  Letterman implied easy.  Letterman implied horny.  Letterman implied, not rape.  Sexual relations.  Rape.  Rape.  It's rape.  Consensual.  Rape.  Last part of that again?  Of course.  Please.  Well, he didn't technically say rape.  He just said that she got knocked up.  She got knocked up.  Knocked up is a term of consideration of rape.  Rape. 
[01:39:00]  The way she says rape.  Rape.  Rape.  So you can't make a joke of what this administration is doing to us financially.  No.  What are they doing to us financially?  I have to take this one step further.  I can't really say it because I don't want to get in trouble.  I don't want to have to apologize.  But knocking us up.  Get it?  You know, a lot of times in the studio when people laugh and people listening think it's going well.  That's true.  That's what happens.  They're not bad lines.  That's a good line.  Our ears are being raped. 
[01:39:30]  Okay?  So the country is, Obama's raping the country?  I didn't say him.  I said the administration.  That's just one person.  Yes.  Financially, yes.  Right now.  That's what's happening.  Anthony, where are you on this one?  I'm looking at a test video of the Flip Ultra.  I'm sorry.  It's pretty cool.  Yeah.  All right.  Patty continues here.  Sarah Palin accepted his apology.  After Palin accepted his apology, do you think it was just like late to cancel the protest? 
[01:40:00]  I think he did it more for publicity.  Conan's on the air above him now, so his ratings are way down.  And he uses rape as getting his ratings up.  Rape.  Yeah.  He's been beating Conan throughout the week.  Do you think that's primarily because of rape?  It probably has to do with that.  That's the only reason people are turning on his show.  I don't watch him anymore.  I used to watch him when we taught him.  How come?  Basically because things like this. 
[01:40:30]  The rape stuff?  Rape.  And now he's become very dirty.  A dirty old man.  Well, I guess those are the types of people that appreciate rapes.  Thanks a lot.  You're welcome.  Letterman's a dirty...  What?  What a fool.  Do you have a picture of her?  No.  God, I want to see what she looks like.  There are lunatics out there.  Crazy people come out of the woodwork.  And those are the people that the fucking dumb lawyers at these companies listen to.  It's that mentality.  Thank you.  Why would you listen to Patty and her rape analogy?  There was maybe 35 to 40 people who were at this protest against Letterman. 
[01:41:00]  But they were the extreme vocal minority.  So they were all insane.  You know, and Jimmy just brings up a great point.  Rape?  Rape.  Those are the people that are listened to?  How about you parade those fucking lunatics?  Let them pick out three representatives.  Walk them up to the CEO's office of whatever company is being harassed by these idiots and let them talk for a minute. 
[01:41:30]  And if the CEO doesn't just say, get the fuck out of here, my guy's staying, you're crazy, then he should be fired.  God, you're right.  Let Leslie Moonves talk to them face-to-face instead of just talking to the advertisers.  Let them talk to some of the people, you know.  Let the head of the company that is advertising with them talk to these idiots and then go, oh, wait a minute.  These fucking morons aren't buying my product. 
[01:42:00]  Rape.  Yeah, and if they're hair products or anything that makes you look good products, they have nothing to worry about.  Yeah, don't worry about that.  Rape.  Yeah.  Because you know they all have gray, dry, frizzy hair.  Oh, yeah.  And you know what?  You could picture them.  They're all...  Rape.  Rape.  Rape.  Rape.  Rape.  We talked to Joe, or Sam does.  I talked to Joe.  Who thinks we have too much freedom?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I love these people.  Here's another idiot.  Oh, my God.  Wow, this has got to be...  But they get the job done.  This guy, Joe, thinks we have too much freedom. 
[01:42:30]  It's...  That's always good as an American.  Yes.  Joe makes a good...  Let's hear what Joe has to say.  It scares me that it's guys like Joe that forces Letterman to do an apology.  We're here with Joe outside of Letterman.  Joe, what's the haps?  There's a double standard.  What's that?  The liberals can say whatever they want and get away with it.  You know what?  We've got too much freedom in this country, and it's not good.  I agree.  And the laws are not meant for the good people.  They're meant for the bad people.  Because tough laws are only good for good people.  I don't break the law, so I don't worry about the laws. 
[01:43:00]  So the thing with Placido Burris, he got off because he didn't admit guilt.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  You should lock them away.  As long as you have money, you can kill a person and get away with it.  And that's the truth.  Look at O.J. Simpson, huh?  There you go.  It's a prime example.  What does this have to do with...  There's definitely a double standard in this country.  And anybody to say that there's not, they have a problem.  I agree.  Are you surprised at the lack of turnout for this protest?  No, because you know what?  If Al Sharpton was involved, it would be mobbed all over the streets.  But these might work.  Most good people at a fourth-side appellant work. 
[01:43:30]  Al Sharpton can get those non-working people.  So it happens.  I mean...  You know what I'm saying.  You know what I'm saying.  I know what you're saying.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  You know what I'm saying.  I like that guy.  Sam baits him into it.  You know what I'm saying, right?  He knows.  And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know what you're saying.  Just some racist guy who thinks we have so much freedom.  I do like that guy.  We can...  You could have got people for a remake of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. 
[01:44:00]  They were nuts out there.  Crazy people.  Crazy lunatics.  Like he's making...  Hey, Scott, go blow me.  What happened?  This guy...  These people are Republicans like Anthony.  Oh.  No, they're probably...  Yes, Republicans.  Not like me, motherfucker.  Oh.  Scott from Wisconsin.  Shut up.  Wait, you...  Cheesehead.  Wait.  Yeah.  Yeah, you should have wanted Letterman fired, right?  Yes, yes.  I should have been out there protesting.  You better talk to Scott.  He's very busy.  Scott.  Good morning. 
[01:44:30]  Hi, Scott.  Very good show.  This is how the Republicans sound, like George Bush lovers.  Yeah, and?  What does that have to do with me?  You sound like him sometimes when you talk that crazy Republican stuff.  When do I talk crazy Republican stuff like that rape woman?  Hmm.  Oh, he's gone, I think, yeah.  Yes, you are gone, aren't you?  You hung up, you fucking chicken shit, cheesehead fuck.  That's right.  You won't hear me talking like that lunatic.  Rape?  I'm my own lunatic.  Rape.  Rape. 
[01:45:00]  Rape.  We meet, uh, who do we meet next there?  Barbara?  Oh, yeah, Barbara.  She was a peach.  Coming for you, Barbara.  All right, we're out here with Barbara.  Barbara, what's the haps?  What's the what?  Haps.  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  What does that mean?  It's like, you know, what's the haps?  Oh, what's happening?  Right.  All right, we're here because we're a little bit, no, we're a lot angry about a rape joke  about a little girl sitting on the sideline of a baseball game.  This is for you, Willow. 
[01:45:30]  Letterman says that the rape joke was actually about the 18-year-old.  This is for you, um, um, uh, uh, what's the 18-year-old's name?  I don't remember.  This is for you, 18-year-old.  This is for both of you.  If she was 18, is that still a rape joke?  Because that doesn't constitute statutory rape.  Uh, being knocked up?  Um, I, I don't think that's, um, a funny joke.  I've never heard a joke like that.  Have you?  Well, not since Letterman said it, of course. 
[01:46:00]  Well.  Only when he said it.  Uh, I don't think many people in America laughed.  But if you go to the library and look up the meaning of funny,  I don't think he'll go along with what he said.  What does your sign say today?  My sign says, shame on CBS and all of his sponsors.  That's funny.  Yes.  That's who these dumb motherfucking lawyers and advertisers are listening to.  Listen, listen to her.  That idiot.  They're protesting because they didn't find the joke funny.  I know.  That wasn't funny. 
[01:46:30]  And she's saying no one found it funny.  She knows.  She took a poll of everybody.  Sam, please tell me you have 30 more of these.  They're great.  I can listen to this all the way to 11.  Yes.  I want every single person there to talk and sound off.  Holy shit.  These fucking, these zeros are just trying to marry themselves to it  and they don't even know what they're protesting.  They don't even know.  She didn't even know her fucking name.  And these fucking corporate fruits.  Listen to them.  Yeah.  I forgot to mention too, the first woman that we listened to,  the one that kept saying rape over and over again, 
[01:47:00]  right before I started talking to her,  one of the ladies who was organizing this whole thing pulled her aside  and said, he's here to get material.  He's not here for the cause.  And so this was this, this was this woman on her A game.  Like, no, I'm not going to let this guy get material out of me.  I'm just going to say rape over and over again.  Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape.  Dennis from South Carolina.  I don't know why he has to say this because I think it's pretty obvious,  but go ahead.  Hey guys, I just want to keep it honest here.  You know, you realize you've got the crazy nuts on the left 
[01:47:30]  from Code Pink and PETA and people like that.  Of course.  We wouldn't even argue that.  But they're also the ones that these dumb motherfucking lawyers  and advertisers listen to.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, I could give a shit what side these guys are on.  When you're so far right or so far left,  you're in the same fucking category.  Nut.  You're living in Long Island.  Yeah, well.  All right, there you go.  Well, it's okay.  It's better than Jersey, you fucking piece of shit.  We're just enjoying that we're listening to nutty people. 
[01:48:00]  I don't give a shit what side they're on.  I love this stuff.  They're lunatics.  Love listening to nuts that shouldn't even be given the time of day  by an advertiser or a broadcasting corporate executive.  They should be just thrown out of the building.  Absolutely.  Like Rupert Pupkin.  Who's Liberty?  Oh, Liberty. 
[01:48:30]  She was, boy, was she one of the ladies at the forefront.  Was she hot under the collar?  Oh, boy.  She was not happy and she was right at the front.  And she let me know.  Her name's Liberty, so she's not going to be somebody who's going to bite her tongue.  I hear you.  She's going to stand up for what's right.  That's what this country's all about.  Liberty.  Lady Liberty.  I'm here with Liberty outside Letterman.  Liberty, what's the haps?  What's the what?  Haps.  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  What does that mean?  It's like, what's the haps?  Well, the haps is we've got to get rid of that old man  who can make very disgusting remarks about children. 
[01:49:00]  I'm a mother.  I'm a grandmother.  I have two daughters, three granddaughters.  And when he makes a remark that A-Rod should knock up her daughter and call her an airline  stewardess slut when he had a bastard out of wedlock?  Whoa, double standards.  Am I right?  I think so.  You think so?  Well, that's what's happening.  I think he's a dirty old man. 
[01:49:30]  He's a rapist.  And you know what?  In a roundabout way, he was raping that little girl.  And he'd love to do it to Sarah as well.  Rape her?  He'd like to have sex with her.  Forget about the rape.  Wait.  Is A-Rod having a bad year?  This...  They are really kind of downplaying the word rape here.  Oh, yeah.  Really putting it in a place where a woman that is actually raped should fucking be so 
[01:50:00]  angry with these asshole fucking uneducated dolts.  It's wonderful.  That's...  We're in a country of knee-jerk reactionary people.  And that's what they're doing.  And then the guy apologizes.  And they want to be a part of the cause so fucking badly.  It's like, oh, you apologize, but hey, we don't care.  We're still going to go do this.  And the news will be there, and I'll get to speak my piece and sound so intelligent.  And meanwhile, they don't even realize how stupid they sound. 
[01:50:30]  This means that advertisers are actually getting letters saying, please stop advertising with  David Letterman because he is a rapist.  He's a rapist.  She actually just called a...  That's fucking...  She called him a rapist.  Like, isn't that slanderous?  Of course it is.  She didn't say, in a way, he's...  She said, I don't like David Letterman because he is a rapist.  David should go after her and get her pension.  Yeah.  Destroy her.  He should.  And then buy rape videos with him.  And have...  Laugh at the rape video parties.  And put him on YouTube. 
[01:51:00]  Get himself fired for real.  How do you like that one, protesters?  Oh, my God.  Can I...  Will, in North Carolina, no, you can't.  For real, no, you can't.  I wanted to hear the joke.  I don't even know what it was.  Don't...  Just don't acknowledge someone talked.  What joke?  That Letterman said.  I don't know what the joke was that everybody's...  Where have you been?  Yeah, what do you do?  I've been preparing for a movie.  I'm sorry.  I didn't have time.  Were you in Caddyshack where the fucking little of the rodent lived?  A movie that I'm no longer part of.  There's no fucking way.  Come relax.  Fuck no.  You're working with Bonnie, not with me. 
[01:51:30]  That's right.  We're replacing you with...  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  I like being in the motion pictures.  Jimmy, you're now in the motion picture business.  I like being in the motion picture business.  We conferred me being co-producer.  That's right.  No?  Not yet.  Not yet.  I would be in the motion picture business.  Hey, let's say hi to Will in North Carolina.  Get that picture.  Will.  Hello.  I lied to the cult.  I just wanted to say rape.  Put his head in the bed.  People are now lying just to say rape. 
[01:52:00]  God, I love our fucking liars.  It was the head, not the ass.  Liberty continues.  Of course she does.  She has a lot to say.  She has excellent volume control when she speaks to you.  Wonderful woman to listen to.  What were they chanting?  They were first chanting shame on the sponsors, and then they started chanting shame on Olive  Garden, which somewhere...  Why did they eat there before they went to the rally?  Shit.  They were all shitting into their shoes?  What?  Come on, you fucking assholes. 
[01:52:30]  God damn it, Bob.  Yes?  What?  No, I think that the point that people are missing is that when people were making fun  of Obama's wife, Michelle, he came forward and said, she's out of bounds, and you're going  to have to answer to me if you question her.  There was a lot of respect that was shown to Chelsea Clinton.  I think it just should be the same thing for if it's a Republican.  Here's the difference.  Let me tell you something, my friend.  Here's the big difference.  Chelsea Clinton was a very funny-looking little 11-year-old girl, and that, when jokes were 
[01:53:00]  made, people said, eh, you know.  I think even people that were like Republicans were like, oh, oof, you know, maybe you shouldn't  goof on her.  She's just a kid.  This situation, when you get a girl that is coming from a family that is supposed to  be this Republican family values bullshit company line that they have, and she gets 
[01:53:30]  knocked up, and she did get knocked up out of wedlock, it's hypocritical.  And to point it out in a joke is completely fine.  Well, I can agree with that, that it is hypocritical, but the standard was set that families are supposed  to be off-bound.  They're not off-limits, fucking, you think Michelle Obama's off-limits because Obama said  you've got to answer to me?  Fuck that.  It's just the fact that everyone's too big a pussy to fucking criticize him or her.  And you get the scarlet letter R put on you if you make fun of the first family because 
[01:54:00]  they're black.  So that's the reason you don't see a lot of jokes going out about the first lady.  I think people get sick and tired, and I lean conservative with a lot of issues, not  all of them.  But, like, Dick Cheney and the administration stance on gay marriage, and he has a lesbian  daughter.  And, you know, they got very mad when Gore mentioned, I think, or somebody mentioned his  daughter being gay.  But that was a fair mention.  It's like, here you are saying this, and your daughter's gay.  Yeah.  It's like they only want to cart their families out when it makes them look good.  Exactly.  It's like, if you're going to bring your family out there and go, look at what a fine 
[01:54:30]  unit we are to try to get votes, then inconsistencies in your family with the values you're preaching  should kind of be fair game, too, no?  Very good.  Well, I agree with you on the hypocrisy issue.  But when Chelsea was out there campaigning for her father, weren't there a lot of issues  that weren't supposed to be brought up because there were family issues?  No, no.  The second she became, she was in the public eye campaigning for her father and then her  mother later on, she became fair game.  But the thing is, she wasn't that little weird-looking, awkward 11-year-old anymore. 
[01:55:00]  There were other things to goof on her about, and people did goof on her and criticized her,  what she was even saying when she was backing her mom and things like that.  But it's a different story.  Like Jimmy said, she paraded her family out there, the husband, the daughters, the fuck,  and the little kid, the whole schmear.  She paraded them out there like, look at us.  We are a family unit, and our whole stance is family and making this country safe for 
[01:55:30]  families like us who believe in values and, oh, my daughter's pregnant by some fucking low  life that talks about fucking women on his Facebook page and shit.  It was against everything she was preaching.  So it's fodder for jokes.  Yeah, but you know what?  That's not true, Anthony, because she could have family values and believe in that.  And just because her daughter gets pregnant doesn't mean, look, I believe and don't get  It's hypocritical. 
[01:56:00]  It's not, she's not hypocritical.  She can't control every action that her daughter does.  Exactly.  So why the fuck are they then trying to legislate and criticize other people that perhaps can't  control the actions of their kids?  Everyone else is a fucking asshole.  Oh, unwed fucking, uh, married, uh, uh, um, unwind mothers.  Oh, God, we get, we can't have that anymore.  Oh, but girls getting pregnant, uh, teen girls getting pregnant by their boyfriends.  Oh, hello, you're a disgrace.  You're this.  They're pointing the finger all the time that you are a piece of shit. 
[01:56:30]  You don't have the values we have.  Uh, and then there you go.  Well, okay.  Uh, I don't get high.  So I see someone who gets high.  I don't judge it, but I say, that's not my kind of person.  I don't want to hang out with that person.  Okay.  I don't want to do coke.  I don't want to be with that.  So if my daughter got high, that doesn't change my opinion on people.  You don't legislate.  You don't, you're not, you're not in a position of legislating morality.  You're not in a position of, of, of actually making decisions that other people have to 
[01:57:00]  live by.  Opinion is one thing, but when you're in a position of form decisions and you have a  lesbian daughter and you're against gay marriage, or at least the people you're with  are against gay marriage and you don't speak out.  And you have the power to make or break these people, uh, based on, uh, sexuality, their  marriages, uh, uh, unwed motherhood, then there's a problem.  There's a conflict there.  That fucking piece of shit Cheney sold out his fucking own daughter.  That piece of shit.  Even, like, I, the bottom line is just cause you're, he's probably for gay marriage. 
[01:57:30]  He, he's with the administration.  He has to do what his constituency wants.  So he can't just come out and go, fuck the system.  You know, he's got to kind of vote the way that they say he should vote.  Cause he represents them.  But to at least not offer your opinion and say, I don't agree with my party on this.  My daughter is gay, but this is what my constituency wants.  And this is what I'll do because they asked me to do it.  It's like, what a fucking sellout whore he is.  If your whole life you believe, uh, you're against gay marriage or whatever, just because  your kid is gay, that's not supposed to make you a change. 
[01:58:00]  That's what I believe he's, he's, he's got a different tone now.  You know, all of a sudden, you know, if your whole life you're, uh, you know, a racist  and all of a sudden your daughter's going out with a, uh, uh, you know, a black guy that's  not going to change you from being a racist.  Sorry.  Holy shit.  Fell over there a second.  I don't know what happened.  That's true.  I mean, that's true.  But I think the change has changed his stance a little bit and he's, he's a lot more lenient  on it now.  Yeah, he is.  He's, he says he's for it.  He says it's a state issue, not a federal issue.  Not that he's a private citizen. 
[01:58:30]  It's just, it's just.  I can agree with, with much of what you guys are saying.  But one thing that, you know, I think you've, you guys have faced personally is the inconsistency  on the part of the media.  You're right.  When it comes to certain issues.  Do you want to interrupt you?  When Al Gore was, uh, being nominated for the presidency the night before his son was picked.  up on a drug arrest.  Right.  Gore called up the major news outlets and asked them out of respect to the family to kill  the story.  And they did.  You're, you're not, you're not wrong about that.  You would have gotten away with that. 
[01:59:00]  You're not wrong about that.  And you're not wrong about the inconsistency in the media.  Like I'm very happy Letterman kept his job.  He absolutely should have.  Yeah.  But I don't think media matters targeted him the way they targeted Imus.  The media is very leans left.  They, let's be honest.  You're right.  Liberals can get away with saying more about conservatives than conservatives care about  liberals.  I mean, it is a double standard, but just because it's a double standard, Letterman shouldn't  suffer for, for the disgusting behavior of other people.  No, no, he shouldn't.  He should not lose his job because people should, in this country, should get a thicker skin  about jobs. 
[01:59:30]  I agree.  Sure.  But I think that it should be spotlighted that if the shoe was on the other foot, if  the political coin was flipped, it would be a different reaction on the part of the  media.  You are, he's correct about that.  You're, you're right about that.  The liberals do get a lot more, um, a lot more leeway as far as the media goes than the  conservatives do.  All right.  Let's get back to the funny.  I'll punch it out.  Thanks, man.  I mean, uh, we got Liberty.  Part two of Liberty at the David Letterman protest.  Do you really consider Letterman to be a rapist or just a comedian?  He's a rapist. 
[02:00:00]  He raped Sarah Palin's daughters.  Daughters.  Both.  He should be on the sex offenders list because he is a sex offender.  That man there is a sex offender.  What information is this based on?  My information.  I'm a mother.  I'm a grandmother.  I have two daughters, three granddaughters, and no man will talk about any child like that.  Not while I'm alive.  Technically, 18 is an adult.  Honey.  He had a son out of wedlock. 
[02:00:30]  He had a little bastard, Harry, and he didn't want to marry his airline stewardess slut for  five years.  So is that a double standard or not?  Sounds like it.  Oh, thank you.  Will we feel better if Harry gets raped?  Maybe he'll be gay.  Like that guy.  And maybe he'll be sucking somebody off.  Maybe he'll suck off Paul from the band, right?  Well, maybe.  Maybe.  You can never tell.  Jesus.  This woman is a fucking enigma. 
[02:01:00]  But she's talking about a legitimately six-year-old boy sucking, like, being gay and raped.  Yes.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  What she said was so much worse than anything David Letterman did.  Right over the line.  You don't just get on that list.  Yeah, you can't just get on there.  You gotta work at it.  God.  He raped those two girls.  Yes.  Jesus.  And then he should be on the sex offenders list.  Then she started screaming at the building about how there was an... 
[02:01:30]  Oh, it's a bug.  It's a bug.  There should be rape victims across the street protesting those people.  Holy shit.  That woman's out of her fucking mind.  Liberty?  Yeah, Liberty.  You're good at that stuff, Sam.  I would get too emotional or too angry, but you know...  Oh, Sam just smiles and like...  Yeah, really.  You can hear him laughing.  Well, I could never have a legitimate conversation with any of those people.  True.  You're not gonna change their mind.  And they're not as smart as a normal person is.  It's like, they're stupid. 
[02:02:00]  Why would you talk to them?  They're not human beings.  You're harvesting material.  Exactly.  You would not talk to these people.  Just let them keep talking.  Did you ever hear Liberty say, I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother, my first thought was, oh,  the poor kids.  Yeah.  Do you have to deal with that shit in your mind?  No, I just went by myself.  We have to stay here for Grandma Liberty.  Is she coming?  Oh, no.  I just want to...  I don't like Grandma Liberty.  No.  Her breath smells.  Actually, if you look at the Fox News video that I was on, you could see Liberty. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, that was her?  Yeah, Liberty's in the yellow jacket.  Really fiercely leading the pack.  Who is that bitch?  Good news.  There were people that were for David Letterman.  We got one of those people next here.  Justin from the Ed Sullivan Theater.  Just to mix it up a little bit, we got that.  But you want to see Liberty?  Yeah, dude, I have to.  I want nothing more than to see Liberty.  Is that Liberty right there?  No, that's not Liberty.  They all have shitty dry hair, too.  Yeah, they depict messes.  Some of the people wouldn't talk to me. 
[02:03:00]  Language.  Who's this?  Fucking Steven Spielberg?  Dennis Hopper.  A tennis hopper.  Dennis Hopper.  What are they going to say?  Dave Letterman was a wise man.  He was a kind man.  Liberty's head in his lap.  I know.  You know what?  If you didn't know what the issue was, you couldn't tell if these people were conservative  or liberal because they're all insane when you get to that level of protesting.  I think they're beyond even like, I mean, they have their partisanship, but I think that 
[02:03:30]  they're just fucking, they're nutty people who desperately want to be heard.  Yeah, yeah.  They need an outlet.  They never have one.  They go home.  Their husbands just ignore them because they're fucking babbling shitheads.  That's her with the big sign right there with those glasses.  Look at her wanting to be a part of things so badly, so ill-informed.  Look at her.  Oh, we're going, we're going.  Okay, I'll meet you there.  Yuck.  Making plans.  Could you imagine her making the plans beforehand?  Sure.  Well, her sign is extremely wordy and typed. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, really?  What the fuck?  How could you read that?  You can't.  So, Liberty, what do you want to do before we get ready?  Well, let's eat a lot and then put on Dr. Octopus's glasses and a yellow outfit and  then head out the door with a long sign that nobody will read.  There's a De Niro at the end of casino glasses.  Yeah, she's great.  Hope she got the same car.  She's picking horses.  She has a body like Pesci.  She should be in her underwear being tossed into a hole in fucking Indiana.  Liberty's a silly goose.  Her sign was littered with misspellings.  Of course it was. 
[02:04:30]  Why wouldn't it?  You can't attack somebody for that.  Why wouldn't it?  It was.  I was sticking up for that part of it.  Why don't we meet someone that was for David Letterman?  Excellent idea.  Balance it out.  Here it is.  Would you mind, what, what, what?  What's the haps?  What?  Uh, what does that mean?  What's the haps?  Well, I see you're making quite a ruckus here.  I'm very upset at what David Letterman has said about raping children and pooping on them  and feeding them in improper places and taking them out to the laundry and spinning them 
[02:05:00]  on the ground and playing them with wiffle ball and using them to bowl and putting punch  on their heads on their heads and feeding them cool ranch Doritos when nacho cheese is clearly  the more delicious brand.  He didn't say any of that, sir.  Okay.  Well, then I'm wrong and I must leave this protest now.  Goodbye, everyone.  Don't leave.  Don't leave.  I have to go home.  Sir, who are you talking to?  Damn it, everyone's in on this.  Who are you talking to?  It's not funny.  Sir, who are you talking to?  I'm talking to the press over here. 
[02:05:30]  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  What are you?  What is this?  Sir.  Yes, sir.  You're making a mockery of this protest.  Who is he from?  You're the presserazzi.  Do you know what your name is?  Sir.  Are you with the letter of the show?  No.  Am I for rape?  Huh?  That's like asking me if I'm from Nambla.  And I am.  Sir, did you just say you represent Nambla?  I do.  What's your name? 
[02:06:00]  Stephen Baldwin.  Goddamn, Dave is funny, man.  Yeah, that's fucking Eastside Baird.  Who was he entertaining?  All the press just started circling him and just like laughing at him because he was making  a mockery.  He then rolled around on the floor and started barking like a dog and laid down and lifted  his shirt up and exposed his stomach.  Goddamn.  Oh, what do we got there?  Those are good.  What?  Nothing new. 
[02:06:30]  Just scroll down a little.  I don't know.  That was great.  And that's it.  That's funny, man.  Yeah, there were a lot of crazies out yesterday.  That was...  Bravo to Sam.  He found some kooks for us.  Liberty.  Liberty.  Liberty.  And, I mean, don't let Liberty make you forget about Patty.  No, no, no.  Patty was good, too, with the rape.  The two MVPs of the pack.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  They were the...  They were definitely the standouts.  Definitely.  Oh, to wrap up our Letterman thing, this is a big clip today, I guess. 
[02:07:00]  New controversy.  Jack Black was on a show.  No, it's really quick.  Uh-oh.  It's going to be wild, I bet.  Yeah, he let out an F-bomb.  Because the phoenix will really...  I wanted to say a different word that...  Will rise again.  It's more like a...  It's more like a...  Junk, jigga-junk, jigga-junk.  Because the phoenix...  Oh. 
[02:07:30]  Will rise again.  All right.  That's it.  That's it for now.  Well, no shit.  What the hell was that? 
[02:08:00]  Ugh.  Phoenix.  Where was the F-bomb, by the way?  He was in the fucking...  Nah, he said it like that.  Yeah, you can barely tell.  I'm so sick of that singing shit.  Not a fan of the singing shit, eh?  No!  Not Jimmy?  I'm not.  Yeah.  He thinks he's, uh...  I don't sing when I go on talk shows.  Oh, look at how crazy...  I'm a fan of the eyebrow thing he does.  Oh, the eyebrow, yes.  I love when he does the eyebrow thing.  Same photographer as Bobby Kelly has.  Fuck Jack Black.  Go fuck your side man. 
[02:08:30]  That's a Belushi thing, though.  Oh, shit.  I mean, that's Belushi's thing.  He should do that other thing he did.  You know, the last thing?  Yep.  I know.  Yeah.  Wow, that just put us all in a bad mood.  He's wild.  Oh, crazy.  Wow.  Another picture with the eyebrow.  All right, we get it.  How many eyebrow pics do we have?  Every picture of him.  Every one?  Every single one.  Google image him.  Wait, let's guess.  No, no, no. 
[02:09:00]  I'm going to guess 4,375.  Pictures of him with the eyebrow thing happening.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  Sam, bravo.  Sam left his ass.  Do we have any other audio from Fox or anything?  Yeah, that's where we're going to get to next.  Ah.  Goody.  Jimmy slipped on red eye last night.  I made a mistake.  A little mistake.  I made a mistake.  A small error.  Everyone is talking about it today.  You haven't heard it yet?  No.  It's a small mistake.  A little error.  It's not that big.  I don't want to build it up.  You can't make mistakes like that on national TV. 
[02:09:30]  You just said you like cock or something, did you?  No, I said mistake.  Look.  I just touched my grapefruit's penis.  Also, Andy Rooney has an opinion about shoes.  Never notice when you put them on, they cover your feet.  Never notice how they feel when your balls are on the receiving end of one.  You fucking asshole. 
[02:10:00]  We're going to find out next.  And Pathroom Munaki is outside the studio.  He comes in next.  And Rich, what are you promoting?  Oh, I'm at the Stress Factory this weekend, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Nice.  Vinny's Club.  You guys made up, huh?  There was never a fight.  Yeah, there was.  No, there wasn't.  He was bad-mouthing after the show.  He could bad-mouth me all he wants.  And August 1st, this is big, Club Mardi Gras in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Club Mardi Gras, Scottsdale.  Mardi?  Why do you drop the R, you e-tart? 
[02:10:30]  Mardi Gras.  Club Mardi Gras.  Club Mardi Gras.  Mardi.  What is that?  Mardi.  Club Mardi Gras in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Are you just you?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, August 1.  It's my sweetie.  Why don't you tell me we could do a couple of these gigs together?  Club Mardi.  You Jew motherfucker!  You go over my head again, I'll kill you!  What can we do together?  Fucking peshy.  That's great.  I would love to do a gig like a fucking weird city like that.  It's a rock club.  I know.  I know what a rock club is.  Well, I would love for you to do the gig with me.  Not now.  What kind of money am I going to get? 
[02:11:00]  Fucking $300?  No, I get the whole door.  We get the whole door.  I don't need a door.  Get the whole door, baby.  It's a door.  Dryer door.  Dryer door.  How many seats?  Huh?  Exactly.  No, it's like 400, I think.  Three or 400.  What the fuck am I going to do with that little bit of an audience?  I'm just kidding.  Don't look at me to try to sell the other 378 seats.  That's my new guy, like big guy on the air left.  We still got lots to do. 
[02:11:30]  Stay there.  We go to break with Nick DiPaolo.  Hanging with Rich Voss today, who's going to be at the Stress Factory 18th, 19th, and 20th.  So Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, right?  Yep.  In New Brunswick, New Jersey, 732-545.  Ha ha.  And then August 1st for everybody in the Arizona area.  Scottsdale, actually.  Club Mardi Gras, August 1st.  Go to richvoss.com.  That's Voss with one S.  And I'm heading to Florida tomorrow to do Fort Lauderdale tomorrow night. 
[02:12:00]  And West Palm Friday, Saturday.  And I'm going to be on the Young Paul and Ron show Friday morning in Fort Lauderdale.  And they're also syndicated to West Palm, which is our old station.  The buzz has declined.  Oh, they never liked us.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That station never liked us.  No, they really didn't.  It's a little irritating, but whatever.  Ah, go fuck yourselves.  I don't like that kind of language.  Pat from Munaki in studio.  Pat.  Hey, guys.  It's been a while, Pat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the first time in the new digs. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, you like it?  Oh, it's different.  It's not what I'm used to.  It's a little small.  Yeah.  Like your home.  I had to walk down the hallways sideways.  You lose weight, Pat.  That's what I was going to add.  A little bit.  How much did you lose?  Maybe 10, 15, 20 pounds.  I can't notice.  You don't notice?  I did.  I said I noticed.  Hey, Pat, you're not doing the hot dog eating contest this year?  I have my last chance to qualify coming up this Saturday at Citi Field. 
[02:13:00]  Really?  Yes.  And I'm going against my old nemesis, Eric Badlands Booker.  Oh, really?  No, you never beat him.  I know.  He always beats me by just that much.  I'm holding my fingers about an inch apart.  Yeah, but you beat him, though.  He was in the...  Yeah, technically.  The eggnog drinking contest, right?  Yeah.  That one year.  He always wins by a toes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's because... 
[02:13:30]  Well, there he is.  A nice picture of him being an oversized burger.  Oh, my God.  With a big helmet on.  That's your competitor.  Is that a real burger?  Yes.  Yeah.  Denny's Barrel Burger or something.  How many calories is that?  That's got to be fucking 350 a ton of calories.  That's fucking hard.  You know the name of that burger?  400?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's one of those eating challenges that actually, technically, I'm not allowed to do. 
[02:14:00]  Why?  Because the IFOCE frowns upon it.  Why?  Because they don't make money off it.  It's not sanctioned by them.  There's not a human alive that could eat that whole burger.  Yes, there are.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, it takes...  How big is that burger for the people at home?  That burger's about as round.  Almost the size of an infant's chest and torso.  It says round is almost a Frisbee.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one.  You go, like, almost a Frisbee and about a good six inches high. 
[02:14:30]  No, that's got to be a foot.  No, it's not a foot.  Jesus.  A foot, it's a hand.  How small is your cock, Rich?  That's why I keep measuring wrong.  That's the how small is your cock joke.  I know, but you got it out before me.  But that's about a foot.  That's not six inches.  That's a big burger.  Last I saw, Pat was over the compound there.  Oh, yeah.  Pat came over, sat in on one of the...  The Obese and Anthony show.  Yeah, he was calling it the Obese and Anthony show. 
[02:15:00]  I like it.  But Pat was a big hit.  People like Pat.  Oh, I like Pat a lot.  I had Photoshop.  Someone took...  Did you...  That lens Booker's head off and put the burger where his head goes and put his head where  the burger was.  Can we seriously get a video element to this radio show?  I know.  It's so obvious that we need some kind of video element.  Can we figure that out, please?  Yes.  Down the hall?  We should.  Pat.  Yes, sir.  So you saw Anthony's place for the first time, huh? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I got the full tour.  Impressive.  Yes.  Yeah.  When did you start crying?  As I was driving up upon the place, and then I dried my tears by the time I got to the  door.  Your trailer would fit in what?  His living room?  His guest bathroom.  His breezeway.  His breezeway?  Yes.  Breezeway.  What was the most impressive part of the tour?  The closet.  Oh, yeah.  That's everyone's favorite.  Everyone loves the closet.  The closet slash arsenal. 
[02:16:00]  I thought you meant the one our producer was in.  Hello.  I'm not ready to come out yet.  Yes, the arsenal.  That tour is getting longer, that part.  Yeah.  It just takes so long to show all the goodness in that closet.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I got to hold the Desert Eagle and all the cool guns.  Oh, never.  Yeah.  Ooh. 
[02:16:30]  Ooh.  Don't worry about it.  No?  Yeah, you know, because it's kind of...  Oh.  Oh.  We just, you know.  Yeah, we had fun.  It's one of those weird house tours.  We'll just keep it at the house tour.  It was terrific.  All right.  Yeah.  We'll move on.  We got going on Red Eye, and I'm hearing that you had a slight...  It was a slip.  A little slip last night on national TV.  It was a mistake.  I hear it was at my expense. 
[02:17:00]  No, it wasn't.  I am not...  Let's find out here.  I don't know if I could be too happy with that one, James.  It was very pro-you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guy in PA ate a 55-pound hamburger.  Mm.  All right.  No fucking way.  Come on.  Aiden.  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah.  There was a guy in Clearfield, Pennsylvania.  It's called Denny's Beer Barrel.  Yeah, he ate a 50- or 55-pound hamburger.  That's impossible.  Is that the burger we were just talking about?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't look like it weighs 55 pounds. 
[02:17:30]  It can't.  I can't.  No, I think it's...  It can't weigh 55 pounds.  No, I think it's like 20 pounds or something like that.  There's not a human alive that could eat a 55-pound burger.  There's like eight tomatoes cut up on top of it and stuff.  Right.  Yeah, they make a 50- or 55-pound burger.  Fuck it out, guys.  He's actually just doing godfather jokes because he's eating a grapefruit.  It's been done like in six hours.  Some juice sending it back because it's not cooked well.  All right.  Here's Jimmy on Red Eye. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, Jim.  Any truth to the rumor that you are single-handedly stopping Opie and Anthony from having me on  their radio show?  No.  Not at all.  I'm actually...  I push very hard to get you on the show.  The problem, honestly, is Anthony is a homosexual.  You do.  And whenever your name comes up, his body reacts.  Really?  And then he curls in the fetal position and punches his crotch yelling, dirty boy.  I just don't...  Yeah.  Now I feel bad.  Just slipped out.  Oh, shit.  You're an asshole.  That's very funny. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, right on.  We got to get them on the show.  Yes, Andy Levy is funny.  Andy Levy is hysterical funny, man.  Let's get him on.  Very good.  Let's get Andy on.  Someone book that, because he is really like, what a great dry sense of humor he's got.  He's just a shitty deadpan.  He's just like, oh, deadpan, just fuck you.  Yeah, right?  Okay.  Greg, what was that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just like blows people off.  It's really funny.  For a late night show, they actually do great numbers. 
[02:19:00]  Huh?  For a late night show, they do great fucking...  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  Very good numbers.  The most DVD'd show on Fox News, apparently.  Or DVR'd.  DVR'd.  DVD'd.  Yes.  Oh, no, I burn everything to DVD.  Well, that's just bad.  That's implying that people watch DVDs instead of watching Red Eye.  I don't go for that.  What an asshole.  One of my boss.  I go, what am I an asshole?  What am I boss?  And he's right here.  I know.  And Rich is still going, who are you talking about?  You know my brother? 
[02:19:30]  No.  Do you have any brothers and sisters?  I have one brother and one sister.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Get along with them or they disowned you years ago?  I don't talk.  Really?  Once in a while with my sister.  Does your brother look like you?  They're doing completely opposite professions.  His brother and sister are in show business.  Ah, shit.  What happened with the...  Why don't you talk to them?  I'm fascinated by families that don't talk to each other.  I don't know.  I'm busy.  Busy is one thing.  Once in a while, I talk to my sister. 
[02:20:00]  Are you civil about it?  Or was there like a problem years ago?  A blow up?  No, not at all.  They hated you?  Did you steal their money for drugs?  No.  They used to blow their friends for drugs.  They were embarrassed by them.  He's doing the comedy for how long?  It's a disgrace.  Disgracing the nice Jewish family.  You don't have any relatives that you don't talk to?  That are living.  That are living?  Yeah.  I talked to the dead once, too.  I got it.  No, to tell you the truth, there is not...  I can't think of one relative that I don't... 
[02:20:30]  I got an aunt that I haven't seen in 30 years.  Easily.  I guess.  I have to get...  I was a kid.  My mom's sister.  I haven't seen her in over 30 years.  It's so weird that people are close with their aunts and uncles.  You know, it's tough enough to be close...  That's not weird.  Yeah, it's tough enough to be close with your own parents.  More or less, their brothers and sisters.  Who's...  That's weird, being, like, close with your aunts and uncles.  I'm serious.  I always go over and see my uncle...  I never understood that. 
[02:21:00]  Uncle Pony and Fran.  Yeah, you're not the norm there.  No, that's not...  Right.  I think that's weird.  Have you ever been close with your aunts and uncles?  I was close with my nephews and uncles.  Uncle Paul.  But then we got...  We had a problem.  There was a misunderstanding.  There was a misunderstanding, was it?  Sure.  There was some missing candies and cakes, so I sighted their underpants.  What?  Never in their underpants.  I said, gimme.  Gimme that.  Or a ghoul, Uncle Paul.  I gave him a bat. 
[02:21:30]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  Awful.  And uncle crap.  That's ridiculous.  Why?  Did you get together as a family for, like, Christmas or Thanksgiving or something like  that?  You had family over for the holidays.  I mean, like, extended aunts, uncles, things like that?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  You know, a couple times a year, but they never liked our family.  And our family was the black sheep.  And then I was the worst out of our family, so...  But you were.  Yeah, you were.  Well, not when I was a kid.  You were a thief who blew people for crack. 
[02:22:00]  What do you think?  You're the shining star in the family tree?  Fucking creep.  I didn't blow anybody, okay?  Oh, no.  You just wore the short shorts.  All right.  For crack.  You had morals.  Yeah.  You stopped right before the cock on your mouth.  Yeah, he let them slap it on his cheek just for a fucking two to the...  For one hit.  Come on, Rich.  The short shorts gives it away.  Yeah, baby.  What do your siblings do for a living? 
[02:22:30]  You don't even know?  Well, my sister, I think, is looking for work.  She's fine.  She's loaded.  She's got cash.  I mean, big house, boat, yacht.  I mean, like, a really...  Boat and a yacht.  Probably, you know, makes your house look ghetto.  Yeah.  It's one of those type deals.  Uh-huh.  And I think my brother's a teacher.  Okay.  Respectable.  Yeah.  When was the last time you saw your brother?  I think in August.  Oh, okay.  Last August.  Yeah, I know.  Jesus.  Because August isn't here yet.  It's not here yet. 
[02:23:00]  I know.  Him and Doc Brown visited him.  I like how he had to correct himself.  August.  August, last August.  No, it was in the August two months ago.  That was May.  No, I saw him on the holidays.  You know, Christmas or whatever.  Yeah, because there's a lot of holidays in August.  No, Christmas.  I saw him on Christmas.  What do you guys celebrate?  August in the Voss household?  Happy August.  What?  Labor Day is a big holiday.  No, I saw him on Christmas.  Christmas, which is in August in your family?  Yes.  I saw him after August.  Not the August.  That was a couple months ago. 
[02:23:30]  The August that passed.  Mm-hmm.  Why didn't you say Passover?  Almost a year ago.  No, we don't celebrate Passover.  Or Hanukkah.  We did when we were little Jews when my grandparents were alive.  How about Hanukkah?  You know, we did the fucking Passover, and my uncle, who was so religious, made us have  to read, you know, from the book.  You know, we do a Seder.  Yeah.  And then he got, you know, his kids were so smart and a little Jewish and knew how to  read, you know, Hebrew.  Knew how to read.  Hebrew.  Oh.  And stuff.  So, when it got to our family, me and my brother, they made us do the four questions 
[02:24:00]  in English, because they knew we were just completely.  Because you're too stupid to do it in Hebrew.  You know, once in a while, we'd do the Baruch HaTadonai Eloheinu, and that was it.  Everyone knows that.  Everyone knows it.  What do you do?  It's like the preamble.  Yeah.  It's no big deal.  Yeah.  So, and we'd do the Seder and the books, and hide the matzah, and run around like  little fucking scrambling Jews for a buck.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, they would hide the matzah.  Yeah, look at that.  There's a nice cylindrical piece of matzah.  Matzah. 
[02:24:30]  Open your mouth.  Give you some matzah.  I hated it.  You must have been great with those questions.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I just fucking hate it.  What are they?  What?  What are the questions?  Oh, there they are.  Jewish questions.  Yeah, right there.  Shabbakal.  Allah, Allah.  Anu.  Aklam.  Amah.  Umachsah.  Tell us, bright eyes.  Why does it just bind, divine fuck?  What is the, the, the, the, the, the fucking monkey could say it. 
[02:25:00]  I couldn't.  What is a string of paloponies?  Those were Polak ponies.  Question two.  Why does everybody in the world hate us?  Oh, look at that.  The old, persecuted, Jewish guy.  Number one on the white hate supremacy list.  Why is this night different from-  Stop acting like that's a source of fucking pride for you.  Why is this night different from all other nights?  That was the first question.  All right. 
[02:25:30]  Why don't you answer that?  Because-  You get a blow job from the wife?  No.  That's funny.  That's what boss asks himself when he refuses a cock in his mouth.  He actually shakes off a cock that comes through a hole in the wall.  Waits for a larger, unclipped one.  Oh.  I like that.  It's more savage.  There's an episode in The Shield where guys are sticking their dick through glory holes  and on the other side they're putting rat traps on them. 
[02:26:00]  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Dude, I always wondered about that.  I missed that episode.  How fucking scary that must be to put your dick through a fucking hole in the wall.  How do you know someone's not going to put their fucking work boot against it?  It could just be like a friggin' razor, like a straight razor right above it like a guillotine  and just like-  That's why I'd always rather be on the send with the fucking cock coming through.  At least you know what you're in for.  Catching a little hep.  Good for you.  Keeps you honest. 
[02:26:30]  Rat traps on the dicks?  That's a good one.  How do you get them off?  Were they hurting the penises after that or just putting rat traps on them as a joke?  They were snapping rat traps on their cock and one showed it got cut off because they  did the rat trap with the teeth and that guy, it's on season five on The Shield.  Oh, no.  So right when I saw that, I ran in the bathroom and dropped their bags on my stomach.  It was so exciting.  What happened to the cheese? 
[02:27:00]  Ooh.  Wow.  Wait.  Let's move on to Andy Rooney.  Oh.  We love Andy Rooney.  He wonders a lot.  Yeah, I wonder.  Why I wonder.  I wonder.  Oh.  Who wrote the book of love?  Oh, God.  I had to go for it.  I don't like to complain all the time, but that's what I do for a living, and I'm lucky.  If you do it for a living, isn't that complaining? 
[02:27:30]  Then I like it.  Then that's complaining all the time, isn't it?  Nobody wonders why I complain.  I've been doing it since 1967 on the same show every week.  No one wonders.  People wonder why God hasn't struck me down.  People wonder if I shit my pants occasionally.  I don't like to complain all the time, but that's what I do for a living, and I'm lucky because  there's so much to complain about.  I was getting dressed the other morning, and I got thinking about how bad shoes are. 
[02:28:00]  My balls hung down to them.  I wish our smartest people would stop reinventing our computers every three days and pay attention  to something basic like shoes.  Oh, come on.  What?  How is this guy still working?  What's with an automobile?  How many different shoes there are out there?  Shut up.  I should have a blacksmith put mine on.  Why haven't I ever trimmed my eyebrows?  Is this thing on? 
[02:28:30]  Oh, yeah, it is.  Too bad.  Not for long.  You ever see a bald head that you want to watch a tank shell tear through?  You keep trying, Pat.  You ever see a shiny, bald piece of wax fruit talking?  Speaking of shoes, why don't they put stuffing in when a toe is missing?  Why will diabetes not take someone's tongue so they can't talk on the radio? 
[02:29:00]  Hey.  Pay attention to something basic like shoes.  You see people walking along the street all the time, and you know darn well they're wearing  shoes that don't fit.  No one has two feet that are exactly the same either, but when you buy a pair of shoes,  they're both the same.  Seems wrong.  Why does it seem wrong?  Why wrong?  I have, my feet are two different sizes I've never fucking noticed when I put my shoes on. 
[02:29:30]  What the fuck?  How much money does he get for this?  Yeah, he's got to come up with crap every week.  Do you ever notice when you're wearing flip-flops and a gang of ethnics is chasing you?  You always fall down on the boardwalk and they beat you and rape your girlfriend.  Do you ever notice that?  Do you ever notice that when that colored fist comes through the snow cone, it knocks your  teeth out because you're babbling at three o'clock in the morning in Asbury Park?  Do you ever notice that?  Oh, my God. 
[02:30:00]  Do you ever notice how bling looks as you're being knocked unconscious while staring at  it?  My toes hurt.  Shut up.  Did that happen to you on the boardwalk?  Do you ever notice that when you think someone can't get any stupider, they surprise you and  they do? 
[02:30:30]  Do you ever notice Jewish men with Doberman Pinscher-sized heads say the dumbest things?  Maybe their heads are too thin and their little brains are getting squeezed.  Do you ever notice that?  Guess not.  You just answered something for me.  I was watching that movie Up and they have a Doberman Pinscher in the movie and I'm like,  that reminds me of somebody and I swear to God, you answered my question today.  You ever sit next to a seahorse on the radio? 
[02:31:00]  With a thin head and stupid John Turturro hair?  Do you ever do that?  And then look at his little aquatic turtle fingers and want him dead?  Has Coke Logic animated you as a Doberman Pinscher?  Yes.  What the hell was that?  Last night's promotion.  Do you ever talk to someone who thinks a strange means odd? 
[02:31:30]  Who are shoe stores trying to kick, making women think this is the shape of their feet?  These shoes aren't the shape of anyone's foot.  What, like high heels or something?  Yeah, what do you, what do you, oh, is that what you're saying?  Or they have to step into them and...  Yeah, yeah.  Recently, the people who make sneakers have been doing a better job than the people who make shoes.  Used to be that you wore sneakers in the gym.  Now people wear them everywhere. 
[02:32:00]  Now?  What the fuck year is this broadcast coming from?  This is recent.  And if you look, last week, Gerald Ford fell down the airplane steps in a pair of sneakers.  You ever notice that diapers never fit the way they're supposed to when you're an adult?  When was the last time he was in a gym?  Shut the fuck up.  Used to be people just wore them.  Nowadays, they wear them everywhere.  Yeah, since fucking like 1970.  You want to cry?  $8,000 a week for this horse shit. 
[02:32:30]  Really?  That's what they pay him.  I actually would have thought more than that, to be honest, because eight times four is 32.  $32,000 a month.  That's $324,000 plus, say, $64,000.  That's like, what is that?  $380,000.  That's less than $400,000 a year.  Not that that's shitty money, but I mean, for Andy Rooney, you would have thought more.  Diapers and cat food don't cause that much.  You can live like a king.  You can bring kibbles and bits while Morley Safer's patting your bottom dry.  You ever do that and talk to Ed Bradley even though he's no longer with us?  Because you've lost your mind? 
[02:33:00]  The shoes used to be that you wore sneakers in the gym.  Now people wear them everywhere.  The shoe business must be good anyway, though, because we all buy more shoes than we wear.  I must have 20 pairs of shoes I don't wear, but they cost so much, I can't stand to throw  them out.  They'll smell like nacho cheese.  Disgusting shoes.  Disgusting shoes.  Yes. 
[02:33:30]  I put snippets of child pornography in them.  But then I found out it's not child pornography.  It's just midgets.  I thought they were fat boys.  My mistake.  My mistake.  I have photos of fat midgets in my shoes.  Why do I do that?  And why do I make comsies whenever I look at them?  You ever notice I ran out of shit to talk about in 1971 and somebody's been too polite  to fire me? 
[02:34:00]  I must have naked photos of Les Moonves or somebody else in CBS.  In my shoes.  In my shoes.  Why else would they hire me?  That ticking clock should be a bomb around my neck.  Do you ever notice how your prostate hurts when you sneeze?  Andy, why do you put mirrors on your shoes?  Do you ever notice you can look up a girl's dress and see her vagina and breasts sometimes?  Do you ever notice you do that when you have mirrors on your shoes? 
[02:34:30]  I can't stand to throw them out.  All these shoes are either funny looking or they don't fit.  These are a size eight and a half and my feet are size nine and a half.  How come I'm not as tall as I used to be, but my feet are longer?  Probably because I'm way down with all this stolen cash I take for this dog shit piece I do every week.  My pockets are way down with cash.  It's made me shorter.  Why is he keeping shoes that don't fit anymore? 
[02:35:00]  I wear jellies.  He's a hoarder.  He really is.  He's hoarding shoes.  My wife is hidden behind some newspapers concerning JFK's assassination.  Here's some jars of urine I've collected over the years.  This is a good asparagus piss.  Sometimes I open it up just to smell it.  Andy, you got any Crocs in your shoe collection?  I don't know what that is.  They're funny looking plastic shoes with little holes in them.  Oh no, I just call them funny little plastic shoes with holes in them. 
[02:35:30]  I thought they were Swiss cheese shoes.  I thought moths ate through my shoes.  Oh, they look like sleetstack feet.  I like to suck people's toes and Crocs.  I have a foot fetish.  Do you ever suck the toenail of a homeless man while masturbating?  Me neither a few times.  You can almost smell their despair.  I never understood why my shoe size is nine and a half and my sock size is eleven either. 
[02:36:00]  And my cock size is two and a half.  My wife asked that a lot.  She said, why are you all feet, Andy?  I never understood why my shoe size is nine and a half and my sock size is eleven either. 
[02:36:30]  You'd think short shoes would be cheaper than long shoes too.  Not as much in them.  But they aren't.  People with short feet are subsidizing people with long feet.  Do you ever wonder why people with Down syndrome don't just lick stamps for a living?  They can probably do twenty or thirty at a time.  Perhaps a whole book.  Why wouldn't you put a tongue like that to good use? 
[02:37:00]  Retard tongue hanging out like the tongue on my P.F. flyers.  It seems unfair.  Someone tried it years ago.  But I think eventually all shoe stores will have something you put your feet into that measures them  and then instantly forms a pair of shoes that fit your feet perfectly.  Years ago.  Yes, because that's where technology is going.  Not towards teleportation, but towards wrapping like putty around my feet. 
[02:37:30]  Right after they get rid of the whites only fountains.  You ever notice collards have bigger feet than we do?  That's why they run faster?  You ever notice they were bred that way in slavery?  Who's fired?  You ever notice when you and Ed Bradley go to a diner, you get served a lot faster than he does?  He really has nothing left. 
[02:38:00]  Dude, he's fucking stuck in forty years ago.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  There's nothing left in the tank and he's just doing shit from years ago.  They're going to have shoes instantly appear?  When I go to the cobbler, I have now a new sole on every year or so.  Rich asked in Kansas City, good point.  Who fucking knows their sock size?  How much free time does this old douchebag have? 
[02:38:30]  He's walking around, what size sock is this?  Ten and a half?  I take an eleven.  Like it isn't going to fit.  How great is it?  When you shop for socks, it says fits size eight through fifteen.  Yeah.  One sock fits all.  You ever put a condom on your feet by accident and you wonder why you have clear socks on?  You ever do that with a used condom?  And then you got cum toesies?  Or fuck your wife with a sock on your dick.  And she gets pregnant. 
[02:39:00]  And your children are born with a heel on their head.  Sometimes I jerk off in my socks.  Wife doesn't like it.  Thinks I put mayo in there.  And then I throw them on the floor and they stand up like croquet mallets.  You ever wash cum socks?  You ever break your washing machine with cum socks?  I used to wipe cum up with my fedora.  It's amazing how many clothes you can wipe semen up with.  I wear cum socks with my jack boots. 
[02:39:30]  Meh, meh.  Ooh.  You're waiting all that time to jump in, Mark.  Yeah.  You ever wipe cum up with a shiny diabetic leg?  Run over.  Perfectly.  Years ago, I went to a man in New York who made a cast of my feet and then made shoes to  fit them.  Murray's space shoes, they were called.  You think maybe the Sasquatch has trouble buying shoes? 
[02:40:00]  Right next to Murray's wigs.  What is he talking about?  I made a plaster cast of my feet.  That's true.  Prime time.  Kind of like Groofy.  Sasquatch.  And he just steps on you with the same joke he said.  It's all right.  I already did that one.  What about the ones with the handbrake?  Do you ever hear someone pull themselves out of a tailspin brilliantly right before you 
[02:40:30]  threw them out?  God almighty.  Do you ever have somebody trample lines like an elephant running from a mouse?  Only not quite as heavy.  Or stupid.  Or way heavier.  Why do I always get that wrong?  Because you're stupid.  I can never get that line right.  Do you ever have someone just be polite in a joke?  Well, he looks like an elephant, but he's not as fat.  Good one.  Well, he's as cheap as a Jew, except Jews are generous. 
[02:41:00]  Smart joke.  I do that all the time.  It's all right.  Very good.  Years ago, I went to a man in New York who made a cast of my feet and then made shoes  to fit them.  Murray's space shoes, they were called.  These fit my feet, but they're so funny looking, I don't ever wear them.  We had a summer camp in a lake when I was a kid, and of all the things I miss about  not being young, I don't go barefoot in the summer anymore. 
[02:41:30]  Why is that, Andy?  Oh, God.  Those abominations.  That must be fungus toenails and big corns.  It probably steps in dog sheds.  I miss a lot of things about being younger.  Barefoot in the summer, remembering to pull down my pants before I defecate.  I miss those days.  Sometimes I sit on the toilet for an hour reading the paper, and then someone says,  your pants are still on, Andy, and I feel like a silly goose.  I sometimes forget to close my mouth, and I just keep it open until the oatmeal rots, 
[02:42:00]  and it hardens like cement, and they have to chip it out with a screwdriver.  There's a lot of things I miss about youth.  I'm not having a prostate like a pineapple.  I miss that.  How about every time you crack your knuckles, you shouldn't come at the same time?  Because your insides are so beaten up and damaged. 
[02:42:30]  You ever have somebody slap you on the arm and your ankle breaks?  Because you're old.  You ever notice?  Feel free, Pat, just to jump in.  You ever notice?  You got one, Pat?  No.  That's why I wasn't jumping in.  Jump in that lake I used to go to.  I'll have something once Jimmy says it.  Jason Voorhees.  That's right. 
[02:43:00]  You were wonderful at the end of Return of the Jedi.  That's great.  Why don't you go swimming in the La Brea Tar pits?  How about you too, Rich?  The La Brea Tar pits.  Oh, that Andy Rooney, huh?  He's great, isn't he?  Oh, Murray's space shoes, they are ridiculous, huh?  It's like you could see your feet on the outside of the shoe. 
[02:43:30]  Like it's shaped like your foot.  Who gives a shit?  Yeah.  I do.  For real.  Come on.  Murray's space shoes.  I've never been into space.  I don't think I'd wear these shoes.  One giant leap for man.  One giant snore for the audience.  Buzz Aldrin punched me in the face for asking the wrong question.  I wanted to wear space shoes.  Buzz Aldrin punched me and put his big space balls in my mouth. 
[02:44:00]  Neil Armstrong doesn't talk much.  When the fuck did Buzz Aldrin get so cranky?  You walked on the moon, asshole.  Smile.  Smile.  Ah, let's take a break.  Was that it for Andy?  Aw.  Too bad.  Yeah, I like those Andy Rooney.  We're going to have to bring more Andy Rooney clips to the show, huh?  Yeah.  Pat, what are you promoting?  Uh, no, just my qualifier for Nathan's this Saturday at Citi Field. 
[02:44:30]  When are they doing it?  Before?  Before the game.  It's at 2.30.  The game's at 4.10, I think.  And, uh, yeah, Badlands Booker, he's done a consistent 27.5 hot dogs, and I've, I recently  did my personal best, or worst, depending on how you look at it, of 26.  Fuck, really?  Yeah.  It's going to be close.  Yeah.  And they only have one spot?  Uh, well, you have to win a qualifier, and I went through, uh, this is my, going to be 
[02:45:00]  my third one, my last chance.  Oh, shit.  It's so nice to see somebody molested as a child is now making that addiction into an  athletic event.  Yeah.  I replaced something with something.  So when do you do that?  Oh, and I need deliveries.  Okay.  All right.  I have a shotgun shell I'd like to deliver to the inside of your head.  I'll be accepting that delivery. 
[02:45:30]  Shall I sign?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Uh.  Deliveries.  Yeah.  The van's working?  Oh, van's working.  Okay.  Fred from Brooklyn's van's working good.  Fred gave you the van, right?  And, uh, I just need work now.  Work's kind of slowed down.  Yeah.  Why don't you, like, why don't you, like, uh, go into the drug trade?  Hey.  There you go.  You're kidding me old tanks in your anus.  Oh, nice.  A kilo's of coke in your ass.  Nice.  How are we going to get your deliveries? 
[02:46:00]  I don't know.  I talk.  It goes on to the airwaves.  Stuff and satellites all over the country.  What's your name of your business?  What?  Name me a business.  Oh, uh, Philbin Transport.  Is there a number?  You gotta come.  Uh, well, you can get me on my MySpace.  Just, uh, uh, MySpace slash Pat from Munaki and you message me.  Okay.  Pat, but you're, like, a funny guy.  You could come up with a better name for your company or something clever or something.  Yeah.  I'm a Pat from Munaki.  Philbin's.  I actually put that on the side of my van.  Yeah, but.  Pat from Munaki.  Philbin's.  Philbin's.  I know. 
[02:46:30]  Does Rage just have a business?  I know.  Philbin's what?  Philbin.  Philbin's.  Sounds like a delivery.  A bin that's been filled.  Competence driving.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  So.  It's a perfectly round head.  Let's get Pat some deliveries.  Are you behind on your bills?  Oh, yeah.  Can you deliver me an audience this weekend at the Stress Racket?  Oh, Rich Voss.  Oh, hey.  Oh, I like that.  You might want to call David Copperfield for that. 
[02:47:00]  Let Pat warm up your crowd.  He's not Pat from Wonderland.  What?  Let Pat warm up your crowd at the Stress Factory one.  What are they, cold?  Pat can do a few minutes for you.  Pat, would you warm up for Rich Voss?  Maybe tomorrow night?  What?  Huh?  Pat, how come you have bruises on your legs?  They look like Vicky LaMotta.  Oh.  My legs were getting lippy.  Eww.  How's the health?  Oh, it's very good. 
[02:47:30]  I got that four-dollar Walmart prescription plan.  Yeah.  Got all my diabetes drugs surging through my veins.  Wow.  And, yeah, I'm doing good.  You look pretty healthy.  There's 27 hot dogs.  You know, and I feel good, too.  Is that good for a diabetic to eat 27 hot dogs?  Ah!  It's 10 minutes of eating.  You know, diabetics, it's over the course of, like,  the long call.  The long call?  I was going to say course, and then I was going to say haul, 
[02:48:00]  so I said call.  Take luck.  You live in a trailer?  Yes.  Yeah.  We all know that.  Do you have an escape hatch in case helicopters come in shooting?  Oh, boy.  What?  He's got a rusty trailer.  So, yeah, technically.  Really?  An escape hatch.  Yeah.  The good thing about a trailer, no one's ever going to break in,  like, unless they're going to murder you.  I haven't locked my door since 93.  Well, you don't need to lock your door.  If you want to break in, all you need is a can opener.  Why would someone break into a trailer, Mitch?  That's what I'm saying.  To murder you.  That's the only time they break into a trailer.  Why would they risk? 
[02:48:30]  To steal his, maybe, Elvis posters or his hats or something.  I don't know.  What else do you have in a trailer?  Like Elvis posters?  Why would you go with...  It's like white trash kind of...  Oh, right.  I have a Leonard Skinner Jack Daniels plaque.  Do you live in Jersey or Long Island?  What do you think they'd want to steal, Pat?  Your roaches or your hot plate?  I love doing this voice.  It doesn't even sound like it.  It's just really annoying.  It's just fun to do.  Oh, wait.  The Einstein poster would be a big get.  Oh, wow. 
[02:49:00]  Oh.  Rockford.  Where is this?  In Long Island or New Jersey?  Munaki, New Jersey.  Jersey, right by Teterboro.  What a great life, man.  No responsibilities, no pressure, just a trailer.  Oh, I got that picture.  Oh, no, Uncle Paul.  Were you a good athlete?  I saw a little picture of you.  Yeah, I was district champ in 1980.  Of what?  Wrestling, Clifton High School.  Oh, so you can wrestle if you have it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just saw Jose Canseco fighting a former competitive eater. 
[02:49:30]  And they had an email.  And so I emailed him and said, hey, if anything comes up in the future, think of me.  You would fight Jose Canseco?  Sure, why not?  For 5,000 bucks?  That's true.  How about for a lot more?  Well, I'm starting at 5,000.  I'll take the hit.  Oh, my gosh.  Can you take a punch, Pat?  You probably can.  Sure, yeah.  I used to be a bouncer.  Yeah?  What is that? 
[02:50:00]  Oh, kerosene.  Pat.  Hey.  He's got a big kerosene.  He's got a big kerosene tank.  Do you own that?  You don't rent that, I hope.  You own it, right?  Yeah.  Rent it from Holrich.  Who would rent their rusty trailer?  How much did that cost you, that trailer?  Two deliveries.  My brother had bought that for me for, I think, 2,000 bucks in 1993.  Wow.  2,000 bucks to live.  So what's your mortgage payment?  Now my brother's impersonating me. 
[02:50:30]  He's calling old friends of mine and asking for money.  And one person sent them 100 bucks.  Really?  Yeah.  What happened to him?  He fell on tough times too?  Yeah.  Well, my brother, he was on that CBS News program, 48 Hours, for Battling Neighbors.  He had a professional-sized baseball field in his backyard, and he ended up moving to Florida,  getting divorced, getting thrown in jail for eight months because he punched somebody  out on a golf course. 
[02:51:00]  And now he's been calling people like I haven't talked to in 10 years and saying, yeah, it's  Pat Philbin.  I'm in Florida.  I'm in jail.  I need money to get bailed out and stuff.  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  Does he look like you?  Uh, not real.  I don't think so.  Thank God.  One of us is going to be insulted by that.  Big boy, is he?  Uh, yeah.  Not real big.  Is he a druggie?  Uh, no. 
[02:51:30]  What's his problem there, Pat?  He's kind of a scam artist.  That's how he screwed up our family business.  He's 10 years older than me, and he screwed up our family business, so that's how I ended  up in a trailer.  Oh, you were supposed to, like, inherit the business and everything?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What was the family business?  Well, once our mother died, he took over the family business, and we were doing, we were  printers.  Originally, we used to repair printing presses for the printing industry, but then we got  into a printing company in New York City called Maytag and Label, and we did, like, 
[02:52:00]  toe tags and all kinds of stuff.  Or, ironic, or moronic.  Uh, and then, uh, he got caught stealing.  We bought into a company where we were a third owner of it, and he got caught stealing,  so we ended up, like, with nothing, having our house sold when I was 17.  Oh.  Yeah, I remember watching the final episode of M.A.S.H. from the Pinebrook Motel, because  we got kicked out of our house that very night. 
[02:52:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  There you go.  That must be nice to see that.  Oh, yeah.  Memory.  And is that when Dad, uh...  We have free HBO.  Is that when Dad abandoned you?  Is that when Dad abandoned, uh, you?  Oh, no.  That was much earlier than that.  Oh, okay.  And your mom started...  This is around 80, 81.  Your mom started this whole business on her own?  Yeah, like, like, in the 40s.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  And they just fucking threw it away.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Your mom...  Oh, your mom passed away, okay. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  And is your dad still around anyway?  Oh, don't ask about that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Jesus, Rich.  Did you read the memo?  Funny ask, Rich.  Oh, Rich.  Pat wants to go to his dad's house and stand there with a lantern in his hand and just stare.  Rich, Rich.  I tell myself my father's Regis Philbin and he's just waiting to surprise me.  His father didn't want anything to do with him.  Yeah.  His father lives about a mile and a half from where Pat lives.  Pat's in a trailer.  I'm not laughing at your situation.  No.  Pat's in a trailer.  So, look, why can't... 
[02:53:30]  Maybe you guys can...  You're laughing with my situation.  Maybe you can reconcile and have, like, some kind of reunion.  A what?  Oh, yeah.  Reconcile, you know?  Oh, okay.  And, you know, maybe now he wants to see you and he's just nervous.  How much is your dad's home?  I doubt it.  How much is your dad's home worth, if you had to guess?  It's not like I drove by and looked at it.  You didn't have.  I thought you drove by.  Yeah, you told us you did.  A couple hundred thousand.  Holy.  Maybe he needs some deliveries.  I don't...  Oh, I want to get you guys together. 
[02:54:00]  Can we call him right now, Pat?  You have his name?  Sure.  He's probably in the book.  I remember I brought him up last time and people were, like, gave the address and everything.  Oh, that's right.  Get his father on the phone.  Today is the day.  When was the last time you talked to him?  We got to guilt this guy.  I never talked to him.  I looked his number up once.  I called it and then I just heard him say, hello, and I hung up.  But before caller ID.  He's going to come to you for a kidney, like in Lost.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  Go, screw!  So you've never talked to him?  No, never.  Why don't we put this together?  Just turn everything around for Pat and his dad.  You don't know.  You guys could be like Oprah.  It's just...  Yeah.  What?  Wait, are you ready?  Oh, it is?  No, I'm thinking.  You know the phone number by heart he's writing.  Nah, it's good to me.  Just give me the name.  I'm going to look over it.  All right.  Okay.  Wayne.  Oh.  Oh, that's his name?  No, the town. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh.  God damn.  What a tragic story.  I have to make a wee real quick, so I'm going to run out.  You guys are talking.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  Don't tell Nintendo.  They'll sue you for copyright infringement.  Making a week?  These are terrible jokes.  I love this guy. 
[02:55:30]  Should we take a break and then try to get this done, maybe?  Yeah, why don't we do that?  All right.  All right.  And Jimmy will be back.  Okay.  The worst that can happen, for real, if you say he doesn't talk to you, you're not going  to do anything crazy.  You're used to it.  You're not going to, like, all of a sudden snap.  Right?  It's too late.  So the best that can happen is it turns around.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How old are you, Pat?  Mr. Optimist.  45.  45.  And a half.  His father's going to start talking to him?  Yeah.  His father never wanted anything? 
[02:56:00]  No, my brother, what I heard was my brother tried getting money out of him.  Ah.  As you?  Yeah.  And what I heard through the grapevine was my father said, well, if he needs money, he  can come to me.  Like, he was trying to get money for me, allegedly.  But he was trying to get it for himself.  My brother.  So your father would give you money if you went to him?  Probably.  Probably.  But I wouldn't ask him.  When was the last time you saw him?  Or you never saw him? 
[02:56:30]  Never saw him.  Never even saw a picture of him.  Wow.  That was weird.  Oh, this is...  Because I always...  My mother always said he never...  And my sister said, he never liked taking pictures.  I go, yeah, but there'd be a picture of him somewhere.  It's like a...  Dracula?  Yeah.  Were they married, your mom and dad, or...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He was on the birth certificate.  Oh.  Wow.  Should we call?  Jag.  I don't care.  Whatever's entertaining.  What if he says, okay, come over. 
[02:57:00]  I want to start a relationship.  Would you do it?  I might be busy that day.  What?  We have to follow protocol.  Yeah, I know.  It's a little...  It sucks.  So think about that.  How we do that.  Is Travis calling right now?  You want to take a break or you want to call now?  Yeah, we'll take a break because we've got to make sure we keep it safe.  Yeah, deal with it that way.  Not safe for the show, but safe as far as lawyers go.  Right.  All right.  We'll continue.  How are you feeling? 
[02:57:30]  Hey, Pat.  Hey.  We're hanging with Pat from Munaki and Rich Voss.  RichVoss.com with the big headline Stress Factory starting tomorrow, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday to see Rich Voss.  Just terrific on that stage.  Thank you.  Just terrific.  And terrific on the radio show.  Just in a different way, though, Rich.  And I hate pushing myself on stage, but you'll never see the same show twice.  I'm just saying it's a good time.  And Stress Factory is like my home club.  You'll never want to. 
[02:58:00]  No.  There's no reason for that because these people feed into that.  I'm teasing.  No.  And Carmelita, whoever you are on Whackbag, you're fat.  Oh.  Who's Carmelita?  I don't know.  Whoever trashes me.  And she just keeps comparing me to a female comic that I don't even care about.  Why are you paying...  Bonnie McFarlane?  Yeah.  No, I said female.  Why are you paying...  Kevin Meany?  Why are you paying attention to the haters?  No, it's only one or two because you know what it is?  Just don't.  Because they're so ridiculous. 
[02:58:30]  They're not fans of the show.  Don't you get that?  Why would they go on Whackbag then?  They're not fans.  Because they love girls.  There's a fine line between throwing someone under the bus and enjoying what we do and having  a little fun with it and the haters.  Those people aren't fans.  Yeah, she can't be if she's a fan of the one comic she's always talking about.  And there is a difference, by the way.  There really is.  And it's a very obvious difference, but...  Pat!  Yes!  We're trying to call your dad.  Oh.  Oh.  How are we going to do this, Ant?  Well, father's dad is Sunday. 
[02:59:00]  The old days we would just fucking call, but...  Oh.  I know.  But now we've got problems.  We could do it through the cell phone.  Why don't you pick up your cell phone and call?  You want to?  I don't want to get my number.  Wouldn't that be funny if all of a sudden...  Like, it turned out to be a cool guy, and me and him kind of developed a father-son relationship.  Because I don't have a dad.  You guys hang out?  Yeah, yeah.  Do podcasts together?  Yeah.  Things like that.  And, you know, just to kind of hang out.  Before we get to Pat's dad, very good question coming in from Jay, from fucking Feedback. 
[02:59:30]  We can't keep up anymore.  I don't even know where Jay's fucking thing is now.  That's a great question.  Sounds like the last race I was in.  Here we go.  Hey, guys.  I'm wondering if your dads will be enjoying Carson's ribs this Father's Day.  That's Jay from Huntington.  Oh, well.  See, that's someone having fun.  Yes.  No, maggots will be enjoying those ribs.  Oh, for good Father's Day ribs.  Hey!  Hey!  It's little Mickey.  Little Mickey. 
[03:00:00]  Little Mickey.  Aww.  All right, let's call Pat's dad.  Give him a call.  Someone got a phone?  How do we do this?  Well, we've got a phone.  We tried at the booth, and the number that we had for him in Jersey has been disconnected.  Oh.  Oh, no.  That's up 10 minutes ago.  He was on to you, Pat.  He changed his number.  Wow.  Treats his phone like his son.  There's some load I dropped 30 years ago trying to call.  Sorry, Pat.  Pat, were you supposed to be a load? 
[03:00:30]  I never asked you that question.  Oh, yeah.  Good question.  Well said.  Were you supposed to be swallowed?  No, I was supposed to be down the crack of my mama's ass.  Ouch.  Ew.  Ew.  Were you planned?  That's one visual I didn't count on.  Ew.  Oh, boy.  Were you planned, yeah?  Were you planned?  I don't know.  Well, it sounds like...  I was kind of young at the time.  Was your dad ever married to your mom?  I was young.  I was like, God, I gotta leave. 
[03:01:00]  I'm going to love about that.  When he tried to get serious, he just...  I know.  He just goes off on this weird...  He really goes off on a tear, man.  I got a million one-liners.  Stream of unconsciousness.  Was your dad ever married to your mom?  Simple question.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was.  So it's not you.  But you never saw your dad.  That is correct.  How old were you when he left?  I don't have exact dates.  Roughly.  Delivery room.  Yeah.  Very soon.  How many days old were you? 
[03:01:30]  Congratulations.  It's where you're going.  You know, I don't know.  Like, early.  Like, before I was one or something like that.  See, it's not your fault, then.  Wow.  It has nothing to do with you.  Could he have knocked up my mother and left?  Yes.  I don't know.  But you were the third...  I saw his name on my birth certificate.  What are you, a therapist, Rich?  It's not your fault.  It's not his fault.  The rapist.  David Letterman.  Do your brother and sister ever have relationships with him, or do they know him?  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  They're my half-brothers and sister.  Oh, it is your fault?  Because his name was Mr. Ingram.  That's my brother and sister's last name.  Okay.  And then he had a heart attack, because he was a big drunk.  And then he died, and then my mother married Mr. Philbin.  Okay.  And then had me.  So they're...  Or had me, and then married him.  I don't know.  How long were they married?  I don't think long.  He went after all media names, guys.  A couple years, maybe? 
[03:02:30]  I don't think it worked out.  So they're married.  They're having a good time.  Then Mr. Koshell came along.  Enjoying each other.  And then you all of a sudden...  Then his blob of shit came out.  Oh, my God.  So you can't...  Oh, God.  Well, that's got to fuck with you a little bit.  And you thought Anthony couldn't go serious.  Man, this Pat cannot go serious at all.  Yeah, Pat really goes at it, doesn't he?  No.  One liner, one liner, one liner.  One liner, one liner.  Come on, what have you felt really bad about it?  One liner, one liner.  What have you felt really bad about it?  You have to assume.  Oh, when my brother brought it up to me. 
[03:03:00]  What did he say?  That we were half brothers.  Angrily?  Because we always lived...  Yeah, we always lived together and stuff.  And the fact that we're half brothers and sisters, we're just all one family.  And then at one point, after he screwed us all with the business and stuff, he goes,  Yeah, go see your father about that.  Just to be angry.  Yeah.  Wow.  That bottle.  What a prick.  Eh, maybe.  No.  No, just the fact that he went there.  Right.  So.  How'd you respond?  I'm nuts in the world.  Probably with a one liner. 
[03:03:30]  Did you fight him, or did you...  No, no, no, no.  No.  Just, uh...  Yeah.  I think I had a pizza.  Oh, you just ate?  Or two.  Yeah.  So, Pat, we're off the trail again.  Yeah.  Your dad, we don't know how to find your dad.  Yeah, now how do we find him?  We were close.  Join the club.  We were close this time, though.  We had a number.  He was answering the number, but not anymore.  Oh, well.  He changed his number.  I'm sorry.  We've been disconnected.  Eee.  Oh, please.  Wow.  Call 411.  They might have the new one. 
[03:04:00]  Sprint or something.  Jeez.  Information.  That was as valuable as what you just said.  And more succinct.  You want to try another Drinking Out of Cups?  Drinking Out of Cups.  An O&A version?  We got one.  Joe D. from Long Island sent one in.  I hope it's good.  You like these, Pat?  Oh, yeah.  I love them.  You like the Drinking Out of Cups?  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's try this out.  The original.  Brilliant.  We got a second one that came in.  And the listener sent in, which was pretty good. 
[03:04:30]  The listener.  Kevin from Connecticut, my friend.  That's right.  Uber listener.  Now we got...  He's in the Uber category.  Uber.  And now we got Joe D. from Long Island.  No way.  Fucking shot puts.  Shot puts suck.  Hit Ed Asner with a shot put.  What?  Not me.  No way.  Maybe Ted.  Ted rules.  You don't like Ted, you suck.  Who's that, Hitler?  Hitler's a douche.  Chewing celery like a randy goat. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  Fucking vegetarian.  No way.  What's that?  An oil slick on the sheet.  Don't slip.  One, two, three.  What?  What's that?  Pretzels?  Whole wheat pretzels, you big spender?  I ain't paying for that.  Who paid for that?  Not me.  Not now.  Not never.  That all you got?  What's that, plugs? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  Give yourself a bell.  Felicicao malasunum padei.  What's that, canned ass?  We'd all be dead if it wasn't for David.  Bullshit.  What's this guy?  Thinks he's a critter?  Yeah.  Thinks he's a crotch critter?  Got critters in his crotch?  No way.  No way.  Thinks he's got it going bossing over. 
[03:06:00]  What would management say?  Bunch of shit dicks?  Yeah, right.  Off pink, stalker cunts.  Fuck you.  How much longer?  What am I?  What am I, king of the cups?  Eight minutes.  A cupmeister?  Two girls, one cupmeister?  Bullshit.  Eight minutes.  What's this?  Right.  Breeze?  Breeze tits?  A tit party?  Yeah, that's it.  Who didn't invite me?  I love tits.  They're so pretty.  They're so cute.  I love them. 
[03:06:30]  I love them on my face and on my meat.  I like to sleep with tits.  Tits are soft.  Never fishy.  Yeah.  Sounds like a Tom Waits song.  Right, I guess that bit's over, huh?  Wow.  I'm very sad.  I've just found out that...  Snoop was here yesterday?  No, she canceled today, apparently.  Oh, really?  She's supposed to be interviewed.  Felicia Pearson and Snoop from The Wire, we found out last night, we're supposed to be 
[03:07:00]  interviewed next door here, Shade.  Right.  Well, that's one very fucking cool part about being here at this building, is you have some  cool guests that will come by at the place.  Yeah.  Who?  And I'm hearing that she canceled.  Pat ran out of here, by the way.  Steve brought him out.  Maybe Steve had to go over something with him.  Oh, yeah.  That's smart.  We're in the middle of talking to Pat.  Yeah.  Steve!  Why did Steve bring you out?  Why did Steve bring you out?  Was he consoling you?  Uh...  Trying to have sex with you?  What was he doing?  A bear?  Yeah, he wanted to get into my garbage can. 
[03:07:30]  Uh...  Oh, God.  No.  And by garbage can, I mean ass.  No.  Or trailer.  What happened?  Here.  Oh, he was looking for clarification on his name and address and stuff.  My daddy.  What?  What, Danny?  Well, there's other people that have been on it for the last 20 minutes.  Yeah, no kidding, man.  So, uh, we tried a second number and that's, uh, disconnected two pounds.  Oh, that's too bad.  He is not leaving a trail. 
[03:08:00]  We really thought we could make this happen for Father's Day.  Oh, wow.  That would have been a big Father's Day thing.  Too bad.  Yeah.  Just another Sunday figure.  Would have made my day.  We could keep looking.  We know a few people.  Oh, shit.  We've got people in the newspaper business.  Father's Day is Sunday.  Yeah.  You all right, Rich?  Sunday is Father's Day.  It's Tuesday.  Is your father still around, Rich?  Yeah.  I'm going to, um, Caroline's Sunday.  I'm going to have him, uh, come down to my show and kill two birds with one stone.  Hang out with him.  Do you hang out with your dad? 
[03:08:30]  He must be a good stuff.  He comes to some of the shows.  Kill two bird brains with one stone.  Yeah.  Oh, he's a smart guy.  Yeah.  I'm talking about you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he just goes, yeah.  I thought you didn't like your dad.  No, I like my dad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  He's all right.  All right.  You know?  All right.  We're going to play a little.  He listens.  Who's huffing and puffing in here?  I'm hearing.  Usually it's Rich.  It's not me.  Maybe it's really plain.  Is Dr. Michael Bodden in here?  Are we leaving in a few minutes? 
[03:09:00]  In a few.  Apparently.  Yeah.  A Belgian teenager is suing a tattoo artist after asking for three stars on her face and  ending up with 56.  18-year-old Kimberley Vlamenic says she fell asleep during the procedure and was horrified  when she woke up to find her face covered in ink.  She wants $17,000 to cover the cost of removing the extra tattoos. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  This is one of the big stories of the day.  This girl's claiming that she fell asleep as she was getting tattooed and woke up with  a million stars on her face instead of the three she wanted.  She woke up seeing stars.  Hollywood Boulevard?  Yeah.  First of all, you're a heavy sleeper if you don't wake up to 56 stars being tattooed on  your face.  Yeah, no kidding.  What the fuck?  I'm a heavy sleeper.  Wow.  Holy shit.  She really starred up.  Wow. 
[03:10:00]  What is she doing?  What the fuck is she even doing with three?  They don't even look like real stars.  They look like little star stickers.  Usually they go for that Kat Von D little thing by the eye.  Right.  Is that the new one?  Like a couple stars, yeah.  That's the new thing there, Pat?  You know?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm up on all that stuff.  Are you?  Sure.  When you tattoo...  I was going to get tattoos of like hot dogs.  How many hot dogs I've eaten?  You know how they do the slashes?  Like a bomber?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like slash, slash, slash, and then cross.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  With hot dogs.  Little hot dogs. 
[03:10:30]  Counting off time in prison.  Or toes.  So she's claiming that...  I'd have to have those removed.  Ew.  And all the other toes are fine?  So far...  I had a scare like a few weeks ago.  Uh-oh.  Why?  But thankfully, and I credit you and Dr. Steve, because if I wasn't on my diabetes drugs,  I probably would have lost a toe because I had a little injury on the very bottom of  one of my toes, and it got red, and that's exactly what happened to the one that I lost.  Oh, shit.  It just didn't get better. 
[03:11:00]  But this time, I took some antibiotics, cleared right up.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Saved a toe.  Yep.  You're welcome.  I thank you.  You're welcome.  Almost lost another.  Yep.  We took up a collection for Pat and Big A's medical bills, and then Big A ate up most  of the funds.  Yeah.  Poor Pat.  Quite literally.  And poor Pat almost lost a toe.  Yeah.  Jesus.  There's only so much money we can collect.  Jesus.  Wow.  All the numbers for you have been disconnected for your father, Pat. 
[03:11:30]  Except for the one in four.  If I don't get any deliveries, mine will be disconnected.  Including the one in Florida.  That's disconnected, too.  Ah.  I didn't even know he was in Florida.  Not according to our phone call.  Oh.  And there just was no answer there.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Really?  What message did you leave?  Look at Pat all anxious.  I know.  You really want to meet your dad.  No, not really.  Not anymore?  Nah.  When did you finally give up?  I figured if he wanted to meet me, he could make the effort. 
[03:12:00]  If he doesn't want to meet me, then screw him.  Maybe he couldn't find you.  Yes.  Maybe he doesn't know you exist.  Yeah.  I never thought of that.  Maybe he's visiting people.  Dad!  Oh, my God.  Maybe he only visits people with ten toes.  Elitist.  Wow.  It's just a fucking...  It's like Dresden in here.  You know, a lot of bombs. 
[03:12:30]  That was kind of mean.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Enola Voss.  Enola Voss.  P.U.  Say hi to Brian in Missouri.  That's the college I went to.  Good old P.U.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  Hey, Brian.  I got to tell you, that girl, that's got to be a setup completely.  I've got a lot of tattoos, and there is no way anybody is sleeping through 56 tattoos 
[03:13:00]  on their face.  Yeah.  It's just not going to happen.  Hey, I got an offer for Pat.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah, Pat, listen up, man.  I'm going to be coming to...  My wife and I are coming to New York, and we don't want to have to deal with the inconvenience  of traffic.  If we do that, how about...  I'll pay for a car rental and give you a little...  I'll give you some compensation, and you kind of like take us around Manhattan, so I don't  have to drive it, and I don't have to deal with it. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, sure.  And I'll make it sufficient that, I don't know, you know, we'll rent a decent car and say I'll  throw a couple hundred bucks your way.  All right.  And I'll catch it.  All right.  Can you leave your number off air for Travis, and he'll have Pat contact you?  Sure.  Okay.  Well, it doesn't interfere with my competitive eating.  All right, let's, let's, let's, let's, hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Damn.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's say hi to, uh, Tom in White Plains. 
[03:14:00]  Tom.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Is this Tom alive?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's where heavy breathing was coming from.  I died once last summer, the day after your concert.  Did you?  DNC.  What happened?  Uh, well, I started to go paralyzed from my legs up, and by the time I got home, I was  completely paralyzed, and, uh, my potassium level had dropped so low. 
[03:14:30]  Go eat a banana.  Jesus.  What do you want from us?  And then your heart stopped?  Well, when I was in the hospital, thank God.  But, uh, when they really push a lot of potassium in you, it burns.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Isn't that what they do at lethal injections?  Yeah, I think they do.  Hey, Tom, how long have you...  Yes, it is.  It's the last drug.  How long have we known you?  Uh, two years.  Yeah, and you had six months to live when we, uh, first met you, right? 
[03:15:00]  No, I said...  You died of the same heart attack for 20 years.  You started to say that.  You started to say that.  You started to say that.  You started to say that.  You started to say that.  You started to say that.  It was seven to ten years, and I was just on the seventh year of diagnosis.  All right, so...  Wow.  And I did die once.  You did?  You gotta get mad.  I know that feeling.  You gotta get credit for that one.  I feel bad we gave up on the bit, but what do you want from us?  Yeah.  The bit was called, Is Tom Alive?  You might say hi.  Huh?  Just say hi.  All right.  I'm still here.  I'm still here.  And, of course, Tom fired a gun live on our show by accident. 
[03:15:30]  He called to kill himself, and then we kind of talked him out of it, and then the gun  went off.  Yeah.  Oh, yes, and then I got invited by the police to stay someplace for a couple weeks.  For at least 72 hours.  They start with 72, right, Pat?  In New York State, that's all they can do.  Yeah.  How'd that work out for you?  Not bad.  I got out and bought an AR-15.  Another one.  Nice. 
[03:16:00]  So it all worked out.  And a shotgun, 12 gauge.  Nah, don't take your head right off.  You know.  I guess the incident didn't make the background check.  Yeah, really.  Actually, this guy in Yonkers over the winter did that.  He tried to kill himself in Underwood Park in Yonkers.  And he's writing a suicide note while he had a shotgun out.  And the cop stopped him.  And then he was in 72 hours. 
[03:16:30]  Wow.  Actually, he was in for two weeks in the hospital.  He came out and went to Walmart, bought himself a shotgun, and did it the same day.  I guess that really helped him.  Walmart has great prices on guns.  Yes, he did.  They really do.  Now, Tom, you're a suicide on a budget.  You got paralyzed after the comedy show last summer, but it all came back, obviously, right? 
[03:17:00]  Most of it.  Oh, boy.  Most of it.  You sound good.  Considering.  Well, yeah, I did a lot of medication.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got, like, cement lungs, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pretty much allow scar tissue.  You got a girl?  No, no.  Training for a marathon?  What are you doing?  Yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  You're making me feel better about my father's situation. 
[03:17:30]  That's what I'm called in for, Pat.  Thanks, Tom.  You know, when I met you down in Camden there, I liked you.  I thought you were a really funny guy.  Huh.  Now, let's get it.  You know, looks on everything, though.  Oh, no.  Hey, what's he saying?  No, we should do is find someone that's worse than Tom to make Tom feel good now.  Wow.  Is that even possible?  Let's go to the cemetery.  Actually, what I called was, you know, hearing Big A and. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, my God.  You did not.  You did not hang up on that guy.  No, I didn't.  No, I mean by saying you did not, I'm saying you did.  Well, what was I going to say?  That's true.  Really?  He's alive.  That's all people need to know.  Hope he saved us from an awkward goodbye.  Speaking of awkward.  Speaking of goodbye. 
[03:18:30]  I think we're wrapping up.  Yes.  It's about that time.  Yeah.  I believe he's outside.  I really want to get him on the show.  I mean, he came fucking three minutes before we were closing up.  Closing up shop.  You could say hi.  Is he outside?  Someone open the door.  We're supposed to do something today.  Yeah.  What?  How long?  I don't know.  We were supposed to do it yesterday and you said I can't. 
[03:19:00]  I couldn't.  I did have to get back.  But we have to do it today.  Oh, fuck.  Mm-hmm.  What is it?  You don't know.  Some kind of meeting.  Meeting.  Is it bad?  No.  Good.  No.  Is it long?  Is it hard?  Tired.  And it's tired.  Bob had to leave you.  Oh, fuck.  Goddamn.  What's up, Bob?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Bob.  How are you?  What's happening, man? 
[03:19:30]  I've seen Rich downstairs at six in the morning, whatever time.  Jimmy, you look great.  Thank you.  You're a pretty man.  I want to get started.  Are you drinking this early?  You're not drinking.  I'm going to stop drinking.  I did.  Again?  Since I saw you last?  I stopped Saturday.  Oh.  I did.  You got to stop somewhere and I did.  Oh, for real?  I swear to God.  Good luck.  No, I'm working on shit.  We worked at Marco Island together and he wanted to make a tape, he said.  He said, let me go on second.  I'm making a tape.  And the first joke for his tape was, who likes cum in the face? 
[03:20:00]  And I'm thinking, is this tape for the Ron Jeremy channel?  Was it awkward as the headliner raising your hand?  Who doesn't?  No, but you need tape.  They want to see tape on me, no matter whether it's clean or not, for like these reality  things and sitcom things.  So whatever tape I can get.  Yeah.  I'm trying to help out little bossy on a reality show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to tell me, he's fucking 55 already.  Are you a producer?  I'm a part producer.  I've got to help out my little friend. 
[03:20:30]  What firehouse are you plugging?  I love when his teeth get in the way.  I got new teeth, too.  Look at this.  Yeah, I see the new teeth.  I have a fan.  A fucking fan gave me fucking teeth.  Really?  No, the fan.  Yeah, one fan.  All right.  Nobody knew you at Marco Island.  Did you guys go to the same place for teeth?  No.  He paid like $160,000.  Boss went to a blacksmith.  Boss got hit from that fan.  $12,000 for it to work for nothing.  Wow.  Jesus.  Yeah.  And this fucking guy. 
[03:21:00]  What are you?  Yeah, but I'm getting implants.  That's not something.  It's a year process.  You know, you can't do a fly-by-night job on me like they did you.  Let me see your smile.  Look at this.  Perfect.  That's good.  It's perfect.  It's perfect.  Those four are perfect.  The ones surrounding them.  You can bite your chin off.  Look at the size of your teeth.  They're too big for you.  Let me see your teeth.  No, these are temporary.  You look good.  Exactly.  I look good.  If Jimmy says I look good, I look good.  The teeth look fine, Rich.  Exactly.  He's just jealous because you've got two sets.  You had to go through three or four fucking different sets of teeth before they figured  it out.  You've got to grind those fuckers down on something. 
[03:21:30]  Like a beaver.  They're not as big as they used to be.  Yeah.  They used to be obnoxious.  But these are temporary.  These are temporary.  Temporary.  Thank God because he can't use them.  He can't fucking speak with them.  Why are they still temporary?  Because it takes a year to do it.  The horse doesn't need them back yet.  The horse hasn't eaten an apple in a year because it is cocksucker.  A horse eating applesauce is embarrassed.  You're a mess, but I love you. 
[03:22:00]  I'm a mess.  We had a good time.  We did have a good time.  Marco Island?  Or Marcos?  What are they called?  Marcos?  Whatever.  Marcos?  Something like that.  But it's a beautiful area.  I'm going to be out where you are around this weekend.  Well, I'm in Fort Lauderdale in West Palm.  Yeah.  I'm in Boca with the old fucking people.  Oh, shit.  Oh, are we doing boconuts?  Yeah.  Okay.  The old people like your act?  Yeah.  Don't tell me boconuts.  Do the old people like your act?  Oh, yeah, they do.  Because you're a little dirty.  By the time they walk out, by the time I'm done, they make it to the door.  That's how long it takes them to walk out on me. 
[03:22:30]  But it's amazing what Levy gets away with.  He's one of the dirtiest common.  And that's why none of us will work with him.  Because nobody wants to follow Bob.  He fucking destroys.  Or hang out.  And Bob's like, I won't do much crowd work.  And it's an hour of filthy, really funny crowd work.  And it's unfollowable.  And then you go out and go, so, President Obama.  And they're like, shut up.  He said that.  He goes, I won't do any crowd work.  And I didn't.  You, I'm going to host it the whole weekend.  Fucking talking to the crowd with your fucking beaver teeth. 
[03:23:00]  He wants to host every show because he doesn't want to fucking, he wants to get any.  He wants everything to be him.  No, it's all about you.  Who carried us on radio down there?  Who carried?  You should have been day fucking late.  Your teeth were there before you.  Piece of shit.  I love working with him.  But he's fucking, he's like, is there another radio I can call into?  Sounds like Don Siegel from the New York Comedy Club on the water.  I'll do a fucking call in. 
[03:23:30]  I'll fucking pack a price.  Fucking idiot.  Piss me off sometimes.  Oh.  When you're on stage and the fire alarm goes off, does that fuck up your act?  I don't know if you heard, Voss.  I don't do firehouses anymore.  I didn't know what that meant until you explained it.  Exactly.  You had no confidence because you were itching like crazy as you're trying to tell your lines.  Chest pains.  How great would it be if he fucking grabbed his chest and just dropped it on the floor and we kept going?  I would kick him while he was down, on the way down. 
[03:24:00]  I believe he would take your seat like that.  That's it.  Like, move him up.  Get his teeth out of the way.  I'm going to hop over him.  Look at that.  It's like a hurdle for a horse.  It's like, you ever see the horses jump over those things?  Look at how big those fucking teeth are.  Look, look at him.  Look at the size of him.  Go ahead.  Open your mouth, Rich.  He should have one of those metal things.  Like, you know how the horses have and you lead them around the fucking studio?  A brile.  Yeah, you fucking freak.  I love you.  He's on fire.  Go to the second page now. 
[03:24:30]  Why, Rich?  He's horrible.  Some days you don't have, you don't click every fucking day.  Maybe you shoot once in a while.  You've been on here for seven years, you fucking figure you would.  Some decades of a little drop.  Sort of like my upper lip.  Yes, but some millennium you don't click.  You're just a little mean there, that's all.  I'm not mean.  You're very mean to Bob Levy.  I would apologize to him.  I would do anything for Bob I possibly could.  Levy was my fucking idol when I first started. 
[03:25:00]  I would go and just watch him do comedy shows.  He used to follow me around, right, before he did comedy.  And my first wife could go, that little creepy guy's here again.  And he would come up with his runny nose and his one napkin because he wouldn't throw it out.  He had for a week.  And he's like, hey man, big fan.  Got a whole bunch of people here to see you.  Did he get a picture with you?  Oh yeah, totally.  Then he'd bring all these people.  Next thing you know, he's fucking getting blowjobs in his driveway. 
[03:25:30]  Remember I used to make you drive to my house and then drive past.  It was a fucking war.  Because Bob helped me a lot though because Bob drank a lot.  And he was not stupid.  He didn't want to get fucking DWIs.  So he would get me gigs with him opening up.  And I would go pick him up off exit 8A.  What town did you live in?  James at Princeton.  Cranberry?  Princeton Light.  Yeah, right around there.  Plainsboro.  And we would fucking go do gigs.  And Bob got me years worth of work.  And my first piece of fucking almost road ass came with you and Florentine.  I was on the road.  And I swear to God, the girl looked like Rocky Dennis. 
[03:26:00]  And she started rubbing my dick under the table in those purple pants.  And I understood what it would be like to come in your pants.  I didn't.  Remember I was jerking off in the back seat?  Yeah, we caught him jerking off in the back seat.  Memories.  And he used to wear these, you know those big baggy pantses like fucking the Raptors had  back then?  Sure.  He used to wear them.  And all of a sudden we hear, me and Jim are in the front.  We're driving.  And you hear something like, it's like somebody's washing a dog in the back seat.  And we look back and he's like, I just can't.  I can't wait.  I fucking can't wait.  And Jim's like, don't you get a fucking cum in my car?  He goes, no, I'll cover it. 
[03:26:30]  I got a shirt.  I'll cover it.  I'm like, what the fuck is he jerking off in the car on the highway?  What do you get pulled over for that?  Fuck my drinking.  You couldn't fucking wait?  Dude, I've never been that turned on.  I was in comedy to be girls and all of a sudden this fucking Down Syndrome monster is rubbing  my dick and all of her brothers were at the table and I went to walk.  I didn't have any.  I was like, hey, why don't we come to the car?  I'll get you a headshot and sign it.  I've never been that smitten with lust.  I couldn't believe it.  Come by the dumpster with me. 
[03:27:00]  Her brothers came to the door and watched us walk and I didn't have a headshot so I signed  a napkin and then you guys came out and we left.  I was so overcome.  Signed an napkin, came in it later.  She got a headshot.  I just started jerking in the car.  He was so creepy.  He was the only one of us who was getting mad.  Yeah, I still is.  But he would get so mad when he couldn't get pussied.  It was like at the end of the night he goes, fuck this fucking place.  I didn't fucking come back here.  One place they would feed the headliner and the middle.  Fucking, that was in Maryland? 
[03:27:30]  In Maryland.  The Bowman.  The Bowman.  And he goes like, they go, sorry sir, but you can't have something to eat.  And he's like, I ain't paying for fucking food here.  And he fucking stormed out.  He was fucking freaking out.  He probably went and got a hooker or something because he met his back an hour later.  I had headline anger for an emcee.  You don't do that to a guy doing 10 minutes.  But Bobby and Jimmy would fucking, Bob and Jim, I would share a room with them and they  would get me food and everything.  One time Florentine went out to get fucking bang some waitress and me and Levy just jerked  off on the television. 
[03:28:00]  We were so mad.  I was just, just to, just to give Jim something.  So fucking, I think, I don't know who dumped first, but like I just saw Levy's ass in sweatpants  and he dumped on the TV screen and I got up and dumped on the TV screen and fucking.  And we just stayed awake for like two hours.  We waited for Florentine to come home and then he just came back and he looked at the loads  on the screen and he went, beautiful.  And he went to bed.  It was the biggest fucking non-reaction.  We fucking jerked off.  It was almost like Voss's first 10 minutes. 
[03:28:30]  This fucker, he came to my house.  I told this story.  During a snowstorm, there was a blizzard.  They closed the road.  I go, I got two 18 year olds.  Let's say 18.  This is legal.  But they were around 18.  So I go, I got these two chicks here.  And the roads are closed.  And he goes, I can't come anywhere.  Four hours later, you hear like a knock on the door.  He's got, he's got spaghetti in a box, in a, in a paper bag.  And he goes, hey man, thought you guys might be hungry.  And his father drove him there.  Now he's banging one of the girls. 
[03:29:00]  He's got his one foot in the cat litter box.  And there's this shit going on.  I go into this cat shit all over the fucking floor.  That's the complete truth.  And then we had to, then we got a date.  Then they got mad because we tried to switch.  Remember that?  They got mad.  And I got so fucking pissed off.  I dug their car out.  And I said, you just got to fucking get out of here.  Remember, we pushed their car.  Well, yours got mad.  Mine was happy for the switch.  It was the fucking worst snowstorm in New Jersey in years.  The roads were closed.  And my father wouldn't give me the car for insurance reasons.  And I'm like, could you drive me? 
[03:29:30]  And he drove me.  And it probably took two and a half hours to get to a one exit on the turnpike.  It was like a sheet of ice.  It was a 15 minute ride.  Yeah, and I fucked it without a bag.  And I remember stepping in the cat box in the socks.  Nobody wore bags.  Bag of spaghetti?  I still don't wear bags.  Yeah, I brought a box of spaghetti.  Yeah, like we were going to fucking, like, I didn't have any food there.  Like, we were starving.  Like, he fucking saved our lives.  He's got the boiling water.  Fucking a deer on his back.  Yeah.  There it is.  Just hunted it.  Hunted dinner for everyone.  Hunted box of spaghetti. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah, you gotta come in more, man.  We're fucking...  I haven't seen you in so fucking long.  He calls me at, like, two in the morning.  He sounded drunk.  You sounded drunk when you left that message.  Oh, really?  No, I wasn't.  Yeah, no.  Yeah, I mean...  Jimmy gets tired.  Yeah, I get sleepy sometimes.  Sometimes I'm sleepy.  He still looks just like a little creepy little bastard.  You know what I mean?  He still looks like a fucking keep your kids away look.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  All right.  We gotta wrap up.  Levy, pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  Good to see you this weekend.  I'm in Florida. 
[03:30:30]  I'm in Boca, New York Comedy Club.  I'm there in Boca this week.  Next week, I'm in Fort Lauderdale.  Oh, you're there with the improv?  Yeah.  I'm in Boca.  So you got two clubs now.  Oh, okay.  So what, do you just stay down there for the week?  No, I'll come back.  You come back and then fly again?  I do my Sunday night show here.  I want to do that, man, but I get up Monday morning, but I keep meaning to do that with Bobby  when we're off.  It's fun.  It's a Sunday night show.  Yeah, so I can't lose that 200 bucks every Sunday.  Yeah, I hear the company financially is not doling out the big cash.  It's either that or get stock options, so it's like 200. 
[03:31:00]  I don't blame you.  We have 200 beans to do it.  Jesus.  We'll talk.  It's a fucking comic for you.  You know what I mean?  Comedians want to fucking be hungry, man.  Rich Voss, what do we got?  Stress Factory this weekend?  Yep.  Starting tomorrow.  Pulling carriages in Central Park.  And the Mardi Gras Club in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Scottsdale, Arizona.  August 1st.  August 1st.  And then Pat from Menachee.  He just did it.  What do you got, Pat?  I got my qualifier this Saturday at Citi Field.  Hoping to get in the Nathans.  He eats hot dogs.  Yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Yes, I know.  I've seen him on TV eating.  Yeah.  I've seen him.  Petitive eater.  I met him before.  That's another guy in the room who has more TV credits than you.  Look at you.  I know.  Please.  Look at his fag bag.  I go to the guy, I go, can you skin a woman's bag down there?  Look at, men don't wear that.  They don't.  Especially when it's bigger than you.  It's a carry-all.  It's a carry-all.  Tampons in there.  Fucking rich.  Come on.  We tried.  We did eight hours on that bag.  He still insists on carrying it around.  My wife has the same fucking bag. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It's a lady's bag.  It's a lady's bag.  Do you know there's a bag you could actually get that looks kind of tough or more rugged  than that?  Black kind of.  What?  A Louis Vuitton?  A fucking bra would look tougher and more rugged.  Well, take yours off.  Louis beans.  I don't want to go through this shit again.  This is very, very stylish.  Did you ever hear Voss's acting when we had him and Chaz Palminteri doing a scene together  from The Bronx Tale?  We surprised him with Chaz. 
[03:32:30]  We knew Chaz was coming in and we had Voss do a scene with him.  Well, Voss thought he was doing a scene with Jimmy and then we did the switch and the  door opens up and it's Chaz.  That's great.  He acted with Cher's daughter?  Chaz.  Oh, wow.  Are you just fucking...  Well, we're not going to close it now.  Let's keep going.  Keep going.  Talk about leaving on a low note.  Paint hello Tojo on your head and drop you out of a plane.  Tojo!  Even with an eight ball, we couldn't leave on a high spot on that one.  What about that bag? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, right back to the bag.  See what happens when I don't have food in my mouth?  We're going to be here at midnight, huh?  Yeah, I know, right?  Let's skedaddle.  All right, guys.  And Stephen Bayshore on Twitter for Stephen S.  He's looking for a plug today.  We've got to get the fuck out of here.  Bye, guys.  Later.  Bye, guys.  Stargirl. </pre>
