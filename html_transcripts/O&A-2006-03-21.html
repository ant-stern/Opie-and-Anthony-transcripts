<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts venting their frustrations about the unfinished renovations to their XM studio.  They relentlessly mocked the inadequate lighting, specifically targeting a disliked "metal donut" light fixture, and complained about broken promises regarding a larger space. This led to a tangent about home renovation shows and their unrealistic portrayals, fueled by a caller's prank call offering to connect them with Bob Vila. Another caller then recounted a graphic story involving a violent altercation at a Hard Rock Cafe, pepper spray, police, and a Bellevue Hospital visit.  The conversation further devolved into criticisms of poorly designed radio station billboards, including those for a "radio chick" and David Lee Roth. E-Rock's tardiness became a running joke throughout this segment.

The show then transitioned to listener calls describing various radio station billboards, triggering a discussion about the overblown media coverage of avian flu.  Callers described humorous and bizarre billboard slogans and imagery for shows like "Don and Mike," "Kid Chris," "Todd Schnitt," "Rover," "Neil Bortz," "Ace and TJ," and "Mad Cow."  The hosts brainstormed ideas for their own billboard.  The conversation shifted to the disappointing reality of HD Radio and generational differences in music preferences. A listener's frustrating furniture delivery experience then became a topic, followed by a humorous search for Jim Norton's first call to the show.  Playing various clips, they unearthed increasingly outrageous stories from Norton about his sexual exploits, including a golden shower and a roadside encounter. The debate about the veracity and date of the call remained unresolved.  A QVC caller's admission of using his Dell for pornography was briefly mentioned. Jim Norton made his first in-studio appearance during this segment.

The next segment began with Opie sharing a highly graphic and explicit anecdote about a negative experience with a sex worker. This sparked disgusted reactions from listeners. The discussion then pivoted to the search for the first phone call of studio guest Jimmy, escalating into a heated argument between staff members Steve and Danny, filled with offensive insults like "green goblin looking motherfucker," "male-eating motherfucker," and "stupid."  The argument cooled down after playing the relevant audio. The conversation returned to Jim Norton's first appearance, focusing on explicit details of his stories and the hosts' reactions, and briefly mentioned Frantic Fran. Laszlo arrived with a Hofbrauhaus mug as a gift. Opie then recounted awkward encounters with his overly friendly new suburban neighbors, prompting caller Brad to share a similarly awkward neighbor story about teenage sexual activity.  The segment concluded with discussion of the PS3's release date and the bird flu situation in Germany.  The language throughout remained highly vulgar and sexually explicit.

The final segment featured Laszlo, a tech expert, as a guest. They discussed the technological struggles of older people with computers, DVD players, and cell phones, including a running joke about elderly people taking numerous pictures of their eyeballs.  The conversation covered competing tech formats (Blu-ray vs. HD-DVD), PSP vs. Nintendo DS, and new mobile phone features like Vibe Tones.  Laszlo reviewed the Sirius S50, panning it severely.  The show also touched upon mobile phone radiation concerns, humorous protective clothing, and a caller's frustration with his technologically illiterate father.  They discussed mobile phone jammers and showcased a clip of German military surveillance helicopters, prompting humorous banter.  The segment promoted Laszlo's upcoming show, included more jokes about Steve's appearance, and ended with discussions of automatic traffic cameras.  The hosts frequently used profanity and offensive language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's go. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We didn't get fired.  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes.  The duo is signed on with XM satellite radio.  Thank God. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  It's a new cloud of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I like Opie and Anthony.  I like Opie and Anthony.  I like Opie and Anthony.  Opie's great and beautiful.  I don't know. 
[00:05:00]  Your mom's box.  We'll be an Indian show.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Pop, pop, pop.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Scoop, ya!  Scoop, scoop, ya!  Hello, exactly!  Hello, exactly! 
[00:05:30]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  I'm gonna kiss you on the mouth.  Oh.  Do you wanna kiss me?  Do you wanna kiss me?  What the fuck are those?  We're never back.  You're up.  Let's start by giving some good mornings out.  Good morning to the faithful listeners of this program.  Good morning.  Good morning to the ONA Pests.  Good morning.  Good morning to everybody watching on Pal Talk.  Good morning.  Good morning to our enemies. 
[00:06:00]  They listen too.  No.  They wanna see what we're up to.  No.  And good morning to all the people that just hate our fucking guts.  But have to listen anyway.  Good morning.  Did we forget anyone?  I don't think so.  When are we taking this spaceship down?  The stainless steel donut that resides above our heads as some kind of futuristic reminder 
[00:06:30]  that satellite radio is something of the new millennium, I think it ought to come down immediately.  I asked for it to come down a while ago because I still hate the lighting in this studio.  Here's what it is.  It is a bit of perforated steel in the shape of a circle with a hole in the middle and a little dropped light in the middle of it.  Now, along its perimeter behind the perforations are lights that would really brighten the studio up. 
[00:07:00]  But the fact that the metal piece and the perforated metal diffuse the lighting, it makes it dimmer in here.  It would be very bright and nice and shiny and cheery if this metal donut was gone.  We've been asking for more light for so long I can't even remember anymore.  The lamps do nothing that we brought in.  They really don't.  We had to go out and buy lamps.  Everyone knows that.  The faithful listeners know that.  And then the latest thing, you know, we're going on vacation soon. 
[00:07:30]  It's vacation time.  And it was promised to us that while on vacation, that wall behind little Jimmy Norton's coming down.  And the studio is going to be built out all the way to our office.  It's going to be one of the biggest radio studios ever.  It's going to be wonderful.  I guarantee you that is not going to happen.  Well, that's why I'm going on the air today and saying that, yes.  Of course it's not going to happen.  Like you said just before we went on the air, the place that's supposed to be ours, that they promised was going to be ours so long ago, once again, I don't even know the date. 
[00:08:00]  But they finally moved some of the people, but their stuff is still here.  Yeah, what's that about?  I have no idea what happened.  Yeah, everything.  The people are gone.  But everything that they worked with is still here.  Only like half the people are gone.  I don't see anybody else.  Only half the people are gone.  All these CDs are, whatever. 
[00:08:30]  The cubicles are still here, obviously.  There's no way they're even beginning to start construction on the new facility.  I know one person that's gone.  E-Rock.  He apparently isn't here.  Where is he?  I have no idea.  E-Rock just woke up.  Worst attendance record ever.  He just woke up.  He's like me in school.  He's me in school.  Did he ever sleep?  He just woke up, did he?  Did he?  Yeah.  So I don't know.  I'll talk until 2.30 in the morning.  He might do that to you.  He certainly will. 
[00:09:00]  I say we all cock with him.  Right across his fat, dumb face.  All of our cocks.  Absolutely.  You know right now, too, he's just completely panicking.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He called Ben about 15 minutes ago.  I just woke up.  Oh, my God.  Thank God that Gowanus is never clogged at 7 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah, he'll make it in by 8.30 if he's lucky with his hair askew.  Oh, of course it's askew.  Of course we're all going to have to suffer because he's not going to have time to brush his teeth.  He's going to have that puss on his face. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, you know.  You know damn well.  There was no brushing.  Wait, can he hop in a subway, though?  Can't he just take a train?  From Brooklyn, trains are like a pain in the ass, I hear.  I hear.  You ever see a subway map?  It's a nightmare, right?  Brooklyn's a pain in the ass.  It's like 20,000 stops.  And it's weird.  They do real long left turns all the way down to Coney Island, come back up around.  Then they come back up.  I don't know.  Whatever.  You've got to change a train before you even leave Brooklyn.  It couldn't be worse than taking the roadway, though, this time of morning.  Why are we changing the subject, though? 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  The facility.  Yeah.  Wasn't it promised us that it was going to start in January?  Now we're heading toward April pretty quickly now, and still nothing.  Just nothing.  Well, I think we should hold judgment until after vacation, because maybe, with the speed  of light, they will come in here and whisk everything out and have everything.  Hey, laughter?  That's horrific. 
[00:10:30]  Does anyone remember laughter?  Well, maybe Ben could call somebody today and just find out, because it's only Tuesday,  right?  So we've got a few days.  Maybe we can ask them what their plans are.  It really is just the weirdest thing.  We're out of sight, out of mind.  You know.  It's got its good points.  We continue to do unbelievable radio and do live appearances, and the show is just growing  and growing and growing, and Washington gets us when they can.  When they can.  Yeah.  It has to be said, because this was supposed to be done in January. 
[00:11:00]  We're self-sufficient, is what it is.  They've deemed us self-sufficient, in need of no support, because we kick ass.  They're looking at other programs and things that they have to help, that need their crutch.  You know what?  Here's something.  Ben, stop promising us shit.  I'm sick of being promised shit.  Just don't tell us anything.  How about this?  I bet that's one promise they'll make.  They'll promise never to promise us anything.  That's fine.  That's fine.  How about this?  Just surprise us.  One day, we walk in and go, whoa, hey, what the hell is going on here? 
[00:11:30]  Instead of telling us what's going to happen, and then never getting to it.  All our shit is packed in boxes.  Surprise.  Well, wouldn't be the first time.  So, anyway, I don't know.  All I know is we're going on vacation, and we were promised that this whole thing was  going to be rebuilt while we were gone.  Promises, promises.  You would think there'd be a guy with some kind of ruler or something walking around by 
[00:12:00]  now.  A ruler, at least.  Make it look good, right?  Just send some ass out from Washington, you know.  That's a good idea.  Imagine how excited we'd be if some guy walked in here with, like, overalls and a tape measure  and just started measuring stuff.  And just make dumb measurements that mean nothing.  We'd be like, oh, hey, it's going down.  But we wouldn't know the difference.  No.  Just, you know, like you said, yeah, overalls.  Take it.  No, I don't even want one of those laser rulers.  I want old school rulers. 
[00:12:30]  The old school.  With maybe a pencil behind his ear, like he's just marking off things.  A miter box and a saw.  Right.  Like the 50s.  Some kind of level.  A level.  Leveling things.  That'd be good if we came in and just throw a level on a few things.  Fake us out.  Really?  Give us something for once.  Hope.  For once!  God damn.  Whose decision is it?  Like, why are they, I don't understand why they can't just go, let's do this and then  get it done.  What's the problem?  It's a corporation. 
[00:13:00]  This is the problem when you're a motivated person.  We're too motivated.  We're too motivated.  It's kind of what we talked about yesterday.  I guess we should just kind of sit back and relax and let it happen slowly.  Because that's what we do.  That's what we've done our whole careers.  Yeah.  Wait for other people to make us, you know, popular.  Yeah.  And make the show good.  That's what we'll do.  That trick never worked.  But we did ask for at least, you know, fucking more light in this place.  Get rid of the circular thing that's in the bridge of the Enterprise. 
[00:13:30]  Or figure out how to get more light in here.  Mm-hmm.  Just throw up more lights.  Do whatever.  Take this stupid phone down.  We don't need a soundproof studio.  You know, they could leave the circle up there if they put some, like, imagine some clip-on  lights like that.  Can't you cut right through that?  In a circular thing that goes out like that.  Right.  Right.  Oh, that'll look cool, too.  Looked like lasers.  That sounds like something that should take, I don't know, a day.  And we're still asking for it.  Get Earl on it.  Make it take a month and a half. 
[00:14:00]  It said a lot the day that our clock stopped and we couldn't reset them.  That was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my radio career.  A clock stops and it's not a quick fix.  Because it had to be reset in Washington.  I don't even want anyone to fucking explain it to me.  It had to be reset in Washington.  That just sounds ridiculous.  Imagine your clock stops and you must call another state, not even a bordering state, to  reset your clock.  Reset it.  Crazy.  It's a weird world we live in. 
[00:14:30]  Anthony in Philly, what's up?  Hey, boys.  My uncle's Bob Vila, if you want me to get in touch with him.  Really?  Your uncle?  No, he's not.  Oh.  Why did you say that?  Because I'm an asshole.  Wait, wait.  No, I want to really get inside your head here.  You just said, is your last name Vila?  No, I said my uncle's Bob Vila.  You guys were bitching about the construction.  Oh, about the construction.  Oh.  Hold on.  There's nothing more than I wanted than that. 
[00:15:00]  I was hoping for it.  All right.  What do you got there?  Anyway, Opie's favorite news broadcaster.  I got you guys some primetime plugs last night.  Let me play it for you.  Taking it back that I was talking to people who had left the church who were critical of  the church.  But they seem to move swiftly with you.  But about the Isaac Hayes incident, let me play a clip from Mr. Hayes on the Opie and  Anthony radio show.  It was just after the original episode about Scientology aired last year.  One thing about Matt and Frey, they lampooned everybody. 
[00:15:30]  And if you take that serious, then I'll show you the Brooklyn Bridge for $2.  So he didn't take it seriously when he asked.  Did you guys get back?  Wow.  Look at that.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We like that.  That'll help the program.  Keith Olbermann?  Maybe.  What, Anthony?  Nothing.  Hey, Jimmy?  You know what?  You had gold for us and you just turned it into shit.  You know what he is. 
[00:16:00]  I appreciate the effort, sir.  You had a nugget of gold you found.  You're a stuttering, muttering prick.  And your presentation was just awful.  Like a miner.  He finds all his gold, but he doesn't even know how to sell it.  It's like, shit, man.  I got a wheelbarrow full of gold.  That's it.  And what am I going to do with this?  He's like LaMotta, prying the jewels out of the championship belt.  Right.  I'm just kidding, Anthony.  Thank you. 
[00:16:30]  I'll take my hand.  Yeah.  Hey, you guys.  Good job.  You're lucky we're close to vacation.  We don't give a shit.  Let's go to Kevin in Ohio.  Kevin.  Hey, I want to nominate you guys for Extreme Office Makeover.  Oh, hey.  Did they do that?  Hey, can we call one of those programs?  That'd be good.  I don't know, but I'm going to put together like a really sad sob story about how you guys  need your office and see if, I'll actually send it in and see if they actually nominate  you.  I was watching one yesterday.  It's on TLC.  It's called While You Were Gone or something like that. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  That would be perfect.  Is that the name of the show?  Does anyone know?  There's eight billion of those shows.  Yeah, I think that's what it is.  So, like, this young couple, they got, like, this triple-decker house in Chicago with a  really tiny backyard.  They're basically in a really bad neighborhood, and they have this plot of land in the back.  So, she decides while he's in Vegas doing his music that she's going to turn it into  some kind of Greek temple.  Ew.  Oh.  Where do these people get these wacky ideas?  So, they spend, like, two days while he's in Vegas, you know, turning. 
[00:17:30]  Ruining the yard.  Yeah, making a fire pit and, like, kind of like a, kind of looks like it's something you  would see in Greece.  And this represents the Parthenon.  Right, exactly.  Does it?  Exactly.  And then there's a, then they built a deck, and behind the deck is just a blue door that  makes no sense as far as the rest of the house or the backyard goes.  But the blue door is supposed to remind them when they were on their honeymoon and they  had some kind of suite.  Yeah.  They had a blue door that opened up to a deck. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, it's just like being.  No, they misinterpreted it.  She blew him against the door.  It's just like being in Santorini or Mykonos or something.  You want to remind them of the honeymoon?  How about you fucking put, like, a wife that's young and good-looking and fucks.  Why don't you put that in the backyard?  And she's some kind of, like, designer or something, so she had to get her hands involved.  A little sweat equity.  It just looked completely out of place with all the other yards in the neighborhood.  It was silly. 
[00:18:30]  Those things are ridiculous when they bring those designers in.  Some of them are high-end, you know, when they take a wrecking ball to the whole house  and build it back up.  Oh, no, this was just.  That's fine.  This was just little projects you do.  Yeah, the cheaper the channel is, the cheaper the project, so they come in with, you know,  scarves and driftwood.  These window treatments are wonderful.  We just used a little driftwood and draped some scarves over it that we got at the thrift  store, and it looks like shit.  Yeah.  Wonderful, faggot. 
[00:19:00]  Can you leave now so I can put this back?  I hate when they put, like, a little cushion by the window and they make it a seat.  Like, just sit there and who the fuck sits against the window and thinks?  It's called a window seat.  Window seats blow.  Here's what I can't stand.  Chairs that have nothing in front of them or around them to entertain you with.  You're just, it's a chair.  You're supposed to sit there and do what?  And ponder and think and reflect.  Like a fucking Maxell ad.  You're sitting there alone with wind blowing in your dumb face. 
[00:19:30]  What are you going to do?  Put a TV or a monitor in there.  Get me a radio.  Something.  Just a big cushy chair to sit and look out the window like a lunatic.  Well, the best.  I think we talked about this when they do the extreme home makeover, whatever the hell that  show is called.  Yeah.  And they take a house in the ghetto and make it a palace.  And then they just go home.  They leave and they're armored personnel carriers.  And their family's left to defend like it's the Alamo.  They just go home. 
[00:20:00]  Next thing you know, you give Junior, who's six years old, like a shotgun because you finally  have to go to bed to watch over the place.  Neighborhood thugs picking it apart like Anne's taking a cricket apart a piece of the dime.  I'm like, what happened to our fence?  No one else sees how ridiculous this is to make a palace in the ghetto like that?  Or the famous pimp your ride.  They always find someone in a bad neighborhood and next thing you know, they have a car that's  worth $100,000. 
[00:20:30]  Congrats.  You're going to have a gun to your head in about a week.  That's the reality show I want to see.  Just keep a camera on the house they just made over.  Yeah, don't leave.  Just keep the camera running like a pal talk camera.  Watch the destruction over about two or three months.  Be able to tune in and see what happens.  I want to have an extreme makeover where they come in and they just put mouths at waist  level all over my apartment.  So that's whenever I need a mouth.  It's right there.  How about that type of makeover?  That'd be nice. 
[00:21:00]  Just a hole in the wall with goo and gush around it for your pleasure.  Little tape recorders that go pssst.  Yes.  Steve in Florida.  Steve, this is the pssst.  Hey, man.  What's up, Steve?  I got to start to say to you guys, man.  Yeah, all right.  You guys are taking off and it's about a house.  Jimmy's doing great.  Your radio show is blowing off.  And you guys are bitching about a fucking light.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah, we are.  Because we want to broadcast even better.  We want to see how well we're doing. 
[00:21:30]  The lights are annoying in here.  It's very dim.  I think if it's brighter, we would actually do an even better show.  Don't call this room dim no more.  And we bring it up.  And I'm sorry we keep bringing it up, but it's something that we really do need fixed.  We've talked about it behind the scenes.  We've talked about it on the air.  We don't know what else to do, Steve.  For some reason, they don't want to fix the lights.  I don't get it.  Yeah.  Because, you know, I've already lost hope on the fact that they're going to actually blow this wall out anytime soon. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I don't see it happening.  So at least fix the freaking lights for us.  I guess.  I just don't understand, man.  You guys are doing great.  You're so sticking off.  You're blowing up.  Dude, picture your job, right?  Not that you don't love the job, but there's little things about it that would make it easier.  And if you can't see as well, all you want is the lights fixed.  We'd like more light.  That's not a big thing to ask for.  It's not like we're saying we want more expensive lights.  We just want the thing that's blocking the light removed so we can see better.  And it would actually help because we're on to this whole pal talk thing. 
[00:22:30]  And, you know, we're using webcams now.  So we want to light up the area a little better as well.  And the office being bigger, our studio being bigger helps.  We want a band to come in and play because the main facility in XM is in D.C.  So to hear and have a band play acoustic or something would be nice to have that option here.  We've had unbelievable visions for what we want this show to be when we got to XM.  And we're still waiting for them to catch up to us.  We're still waiting for them to catch up to us.  We want a lounge built.  We want a place where there's a stage where people can come in and perform. 
[00:23:00]  We have the plans.  And they were promised us last time we were in Washington.  I couldn't even tell you the last time we were in Washington.  And they said the first of the year we're moving the people out.  And soon after that we'll start construction.  And then that date passed by.  And then they're like, well, when you're on vacation we'll start the construction because it'll be easier then.  And I don't see how they're possibly going to start the construction.  I'm not listening to you, Steve.  Do you notice that yet?  You said what you had to say and now you got me more pissed off so now I have to rant a little bit. 
[00:23:30]  Don't cut yourself short, man, because you guys have an un...  How about we cut you short?  There you go.  Because you're not listening.  You know, we have a vision for this program.  And if we get what we want...  We just can't see it because the light's up.  Yeah, it's dark.  But, you know, just don't promise us anything, please.  Yeah.  Just surprise us.  That's how we work now.  Just surprise us.  Hopefully with good stuff.  Love this.  All of a sudden you go, you're not going to believe this, guys.  But, holy crap. 
[00:24:00]  And then we get to go, well, why didn't you tell us?  And that's great.  When we come in from vacation and it's all done, wouldn't that be amazing?  And the weird thing is how the corporate world, you know, works.  They hope you have a short-term memory like, oh, they're not going to remember that we told  them that the first of the year we were going to redo the studio.  But we're going to redo it while you're on vacation.  And then that's not going to happen.  They go, yeah, this is what they do then.  Well, we know we promised that while you were on vacation we were going to do the reconstruction.  But now, you know, we've got to wait until June. 
[00:24:30]  It's been pushed off.  Budget matters.  But they're already hoping you forgot that they initially promised it to you back in January.  Yeah.  And that's how the corporate world works.  They just keep pushing, pushing, pushing things off and hope your memory fades.  And no wonder we have no respect for them.  It's corporation.  Any corporation, it happens.  No one wants to accept responsibility for everything.  They just talk to shut you up.  And then, oh, we don't know what happened.  Yuck.  All right.  Well, Jamie in New Jersey.  Jamie, what's up? 
[00:25:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How you doing, girl's name?  Hey.  That UFO on the ceiling is probably worth a couple thousand bucks.  You ought to rip it down off the ceiling, have everybody coming in, sign the thing, and auction it off on eBay.  Well, I asked Anthony how easy it would be to take this down today.  Where'd he go?  All right.  All right.  We'll move on here.  Let's go to Mark in Ohio.  Mark.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Mark.  Hey, got a quick home makeover story for you. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  We recently had a guy who had his house totally done.  They gave him a brand new Harley about a week or two ago.  He had his Harley stolen.  I told you, man.  Jesus.  That's great.  See, this is what they don't want to tell you.  Thanks.  They know they're leaving these neighborhoods and pretty much saying, hey, good luck, bro.  It's like a pile of cash in the street.  And then they drive away.  Great.  Well, I'll take this call because it comes in a lot.  Clint and San Antonio. 
[00:26:00]  What's up, Clint?  Hey, I just want to know, did you bitch this much when you guys were on in the afternoons,  or are you guys just grouchy morning guy?  Both.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  No, you know, there's definitely a degree of bitching on this program because we get frustrated.  Clint, we get frustrated.  We're promised things, and then it just never happens.  I should get a list of the things that they promised us when we first got to XM and throw it on a website,  and then you would understand why we bitch so much.  No, you wouldn't.  No, I understand. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, it just seems like first thing in the morning, as soon as the music stops playing, you know, it's, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, money, money, money, money, money.  We're not bitching about money.  We're not asking about money.  Clint.  Clint.  That was just my feeble attempt at my Anthony Howey impression.  Clint, that was horrible.  Clint, let me tell you.  Say lighting, lighting, lighting.  Clint, let me.  Office, office, office.  We would love to bitch and let you all know that we're drastically underpaid, but no one's going to understand that, you know?  But we are. 
[00:27:00]  We're underpaid, too.  When you see.  There you go, Opie.  The multitudes out there are really going to sympathize with that one.  The New York Papers had no problem printing up Howard Stern's salary.  Now, that's a lot of money.  Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me?  It's got to be $10, $20 more than I make.  The guy was making a minimum of $20 million a year for many, many years straight.  But after taxes.  Yeah, right?  You've got to cut that in half.  Yeah, yuck.  And then what are you going to do with that?  Exactly, besides live and buy everything you want.  Give me a bag of shells. 
[00:27:30]  But Clint, you know, and every day there seems to be a tiny little thing that's going on,  and we need our equipment working, you know, perfectly so we can broadcast.  That's all.  But if I showed you the list, you would be amazed.  You'd be amazed.  All right, man.  I love you guys.  You know what?  We sat down at XM.  The first thing they said was, you know, the first thing we're going to do is get a national  TV commercial out there.  Still waiting for that.  All right.  Remember the ideas?  We came up with all these ideas.  People were in a conference room laughing and laughing.  Oh, my God.  That's terrific. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  Ah.  What happened?  Let me, let me, nothing.  We ended up in some kind of, like, music papers, underground music papers.  We were above urinals.  And we were above urinals for a while.  Well, that's just like a national TV spot.  But they hope we forgot all that shit.  We were in underground music papers.  You see the ads around here on the backs of the buses for the radio chick? 
[00:28:30]  Are you kidding?  Dude.  Built like a woman thinks like a man.  Yeah, that's what, uh, yeah.  It's an awful, awful, awful promotion.  Built like a woman and thinks like, oh, that's intriguing.  That's great.  Does she?  Really?  The best part is they're trying to make her look like she's still hot.  She hasn't been hot in 10 years.  But they keep photo brushing her fucking publicity photos. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, shit.  They're starting to use, they're starting to use weird angles and, like, uh.  Lighting.  And what's called the heart lens.  Yeah.  The heart lens.  It's the one they started using on the band Heart later in their career.  For the rest of the country, the radio chick is this, uh, this, uh, female shock jock in New York.  We worked with, uh, I don't know, an NAW.  I don't know where it all went wrong with her.  She was convinced that I got her fired, which is just not true.  But, uh, uh, but they try to make, make it sound like she's really a sexy bitch. 
[00:29:30]  And that she has big, big tits and everything.  Ugh!  My grandmother's got big tits, too.  That way.  Doesn't necessarily complete the package.  It doesn't hurt either.  Yeah.  I mean, if you're gonna fuck a much older woman, she might as well have big, nice tits to wrap around your hug.  Well, look, look, here's the latest.  Look, here's the latest shot.  They actually have the cameraman stuck to the ceiling.  Yeah, she's kind of looking up. 
[00:30:00]  And she's looking up.  Because looking up is very good.  It stretches the face out.  Looking up, uh...  So it's almost like a facelift.  Looking up takes care of a world of hurt.  And then what you also have to do is overexpose the picture.  Make it very light so it takes away from any imperfections.  Shadowing wrinkles, right?  Shadowing.  And it's looking down on her, uh, cleavage.  I'm sure she was hot back in her day, but...  I would say probably early 90s.  But the old gag of, you know, you're a hot chick on the radio.  Come on. 
[00:30:30]  See, the thing is, sexy is never funny.  It's like, you shouldn't sell yourself as a sexy chick who's set...  Just, if you're becoming a mess, be a mess.  That's what's...  No one wanted to fuck Rose Ann.  You laughed at her, though, because she's funny.  Stop trying to be sexy.  Sexy and funny never go hand in hand.  They just don't.  When you're trying to market yourself as sassy.  Sassy.  And, uh, you know, really a pretty thing to look at.  And also funny.  It's not happening.  No.  I'm sorry.  You find me one really funny, sexy woman.  So, so what does the billboard say in the back of the bus? 
[00:31:00]  It says, uh, built like a woman.  Oh, yeah.  Thinks like a man.  Okay.  Thinks like a man.  Wow.  That's nice.  It's also what Andrea Yates has on her fucking back of her car.  By the way, her, uh, I love the fact that her ex-husband just married, and now she's  on a retrial.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were monitoring her to see if, uh...  What woman...  You know, I understand he had absolutely nothing to do with it and everything like that, but  what woman wants to take on that kind of fucking baggage?  The guy's kids were drowned one by one. 
[00:31:30]  You know, there's at least five days a year he's going to be miserable.  Oh, at least.  I'm not counting holidays.  Not counting Christmas and, right, five little birthdays that are good.  Oh, I forgot.  June 11th.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  The guy...  The guy...  It's Aprilane!  Holy, what is wrong?  She's just looking at the calendar.  They got it.  It's got to be spread out, like, it's a couple of times, uh, a couple of months. 
[00:32:00]  You can't go on vacation with him.  No!  You got a plan on...  Ah!  Ah!  God!  It's November 3rd!  He was my oldest.  Uh...  For at least one minute, she was the oldest!  Oh, man.  Wow.  What is wrong with you?  That's just a lot of baggage...  It certainly is.  ...for a woman to take on. 
[00:32:30]  So, he got remarried?  Yes.  Yep.  Private ceremony.  Remarried.  On the day of her, uh, that her retrial started.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jake in New York.  Why don't we just, as a society, just snub her out like a roach?  Why is she alive?  Why is there a retrial now?  That's probably just for insanity reasons.  Yeah, that is.  Psychiatrists.  Well, Jimmy, uh, you know it would cost more to kill her than put her away for her life in a prison.  I'll pony up a few bucks.  Eh.  Why not?  Uh, let's go to Jake in New York. 
[00:33:00]  Hey, guys, have you seen David Lee Roth's billboard?  He looks like fucking Jack Nicholson from the Cuckoo's Nest after the lobotomy.  He's fucking...  He's got a look on his face like fucking Donald Lugosi.  It's horrendous.  And he looks...  He's white.  He looks like he's fucking dead.  Yeah.  What does the ad say?  Is there a slogan with it?  Uh, it says...  Ugh.  It just says David Lee Roth in the morning.  You know, it doesn't really say anything.  Oh, come on in.  Slash plenty of room. 
[00:33:30]  There was some...  There was some kind of a catchphrase.  All right.  Can't remember it, though.  Running with the devil.  Oh.  Running with the devil.  That was it.  Oh, boy.  Ben has got to be kidding.  Yes.  Ben, please tell me you're joking.  No.  That couldn't be real.  It says running with the devil.  David Lee Roth.  All right.  Here's...  In reference to the audience?  Here's today's bit.  Because we love, you know, pulling down the old eighth wall there.  Whoa.  Octagon.  The octagon, right.  Mm-hmm.  Has there ever been a radio billboard that was good? 
[00:34:00]  A good one?  I've been all over the country, and you see, like, the local morning shows, billboards and stuff,  and they're always awful.  They're hokey or have awful little catchphrase sayings.  Funny faces, like, their mouth wide open, their hands splayed out, like, what the heck?  What do you want from me?  What the heck?  I'm just a radio guy.  Ah!  I'm trying to remember some of the...  Oh, the gay team guys.  Like, the big, fat radio jock guy.  There was a...  What was the duo that was in Jersey for a while? 
[00:34:30]  Their billboard was, like, right when you used to lose K-Rock's signal on there.  They were the morning guys up there forever.  Were they in Dover?  Shit.  Oh.  I have no idea.  Right around, like, Bridgeport, you'd...  Oh, um...  It starts with an M, I think.  Um, A and D-S.  No, you have no idea.  No clue.  Someone will help us out.  Yeah.  Well, let's get some of those...  But they were, let me just say, their billboard was two big, just fat guys, and standing there 
[00:35:00]  all fat with, uh, that wacky look like Jimmy had on his face, like, what?  Hey, what?  We're just fat guys on the air.  You'll love us.  Ugh.  And I passed it.  Yeah, yeah.  That type of...  If it wasn't Hawaiian, it was just, like, an awful Van Heusen sweater.  That would be a fun website to go to, by the way.  Just badradiobillboards.org.  Dot org.  Fucking...  Not even good enough for the dot com. 
[00:35:30]  See that billboard?  Fucking, uh, Opie and Anthony show.  Most of us get here on time.  How is the cruise in there, E-Rock?  I'm surprised he made it this fast.  A little rough.  What's up, B-Rock?  Hey.  Hey, sweetie.  What happened to you this morning?  Eh, I ran late.  Whoa, hey, easy.  Don't cause a ruckus.  This is free of feedback.  We know you're late.  That would work good as an alarm clock, that feedback.  We know you're late.  Yeah.  What happened?  Overslep.  Alarm.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  What's wrong with it?  See, I don't...  Slept right through it.  Holy...  Stop using that mic now.  Holy shit.  Oh, great.  Now my mic is all...  Is it the headphones or the mic?  See, I have...  I don't have sympathy for the oversleeping excuse when you do morning radio.  I got two alarm clocks.  One that's plugged in and one that's not plugged in just in case electricity goes out.  Yeah.  Here's what you get.  Get yourself a Bose...  If you sleep through a Bose alarm clock...  Mm-hmm.  You put...  I wake up to Sinatra every morning. 
[00:36:30]  Hey.  Because I couldn't take Ozzy.  It was too fucking loud.  It was too disturbing to wake up to.  I don't know.  It...  There's nothing louder.  You can't sleep through a Bose alarm.  Yeah.  You cannot do it.  If you do, you're a cadaver.  You cannot do it.  You know what I wake up to every morning?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, you got that one.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.

[00:40:00]  yesterday anthony and i were just doing a little signing after the uh live broadcast at the hard rock  cafe and also we heard this huge thud from behind us and it was this big uh you know um oh that'd be  me all right it was it was your head we had thick glass behind us that opened up to the entrance of  the hard rock basically the stairs or whatever right right and that was your head that was going into it  well what had happened was right where you guys were set up for your signing and stuff i was sitting  right in those those um chairs there above the broadcast area like yeah like the vip area i had turned 
[00:40:30]  that partition which i didn't know it was a partition where i didn't even know it was glass until i heard  it on the replay yesterday but as i turned that corner i kind of like bounced into some guy and  what had happened was he didn't like it too much so he pushed me and punched me in the back of my head  at that point i got my bearings i swung back at him then all of a sudden three um security guards were  on top of me they kind of like jumped on me i got pepper sprayed uh and i guess i'm not quite sure 
[00:41:00]  as when you guys i didn't even know you guys were right behind that wall there oh we watched the whole  thing it was great yeah you got your ass handed to you all you're an animal man it took for a while  for them to get you down why were you why were you then fighting with security though well at this  point i they jumped on top of me and i just want to stand up just to explain listen see hold on hold  on hold on here's where everyone makes a mistake from the guy at the bar to the guy on the episode 
[00:41:30]  of cops why does everyone feel they have to stand up to explain themselves when they will keep hitting  you to keep you down like i hear that excuse all the time hey i was just trying to stand up  and explain it's like no no wait wait wait i'm explaining and the guy's going put your hands behind  your back put your hands behind your back and and they're obviously fighting why not just get on  the ground and then explain well why not just grab the guy that sucker punched me also you know i mean 
[00:42:00]  it's it's it's it's i'm at a position well someone did have him uh grabbed but then he wasn't fighting  back so they just let him kind of relax yeah he's kind of like lingered away and i just wanted to get  up and explain myself and at that point my wife you know i was on the ground and i kind of felt like  neo from uh revolutions where the people were just flying off of me and then well that wasn't  working too well and then what you had said yesterday about the coat room with the hangers 
[00:42:30]  yeah i didn't realize that i was dragged into a coat room i had just thought that everybody was  hushed you know rushed out of the area that i was in and well at this point my eyes are you know i've  been pepper sprayed and everything now there's four other cops on me and now i got seven people  total and it took them a while to get the handcuffs on me and in that room a couple of uh chesters came  upon me you know if you're in the liver and shit well anyway i'm bombing here what you got uh kicked a 
[00:43:00]  few times a few oh my god it gets even better than that i ended up in bellevue i have a broken nose  i still can't feel my fingers from the handcuffs and i they gave me a needle to like kind of knock  me out and then i woke up again and i was strapped to the the hospital bed no way dude i don't know  way i don't mean to laugh i'm sorry no you can laugh man but we were watching this go down like this  guy's an animal i i didn't know what they were going to do to try to calm you down because i couldn't 
[00:43:30]  believe how how hard you fought back well at this point now i'm strapped uh you know i'm strapped to  the the hospital bed and then another needle comes my way and then i wake up a little bit later kind  of like uh which ways no you know and then uh they the nurse comes up to me and says okay you're free  to go so basically they beat the shit out of me i was screaming bloody murder you know please please 
[00:44:00]  unlock you know uh unclip the the handcuffs at least one click because it was hurting so goddamn bad  yeah but then uh you know i i have a broken nose uh bruises upon everything on my body i just don't  get people not cooperating it's it could because and not because you know oh you're backing down or  anything you will only get beaten if you don't cooperate it's just the way i know that now i've never  understood why you don't just go prone and you never figured out why that guy punched you no he 
[00:44:30]  left my wife actually seen him kind of slither away there were some pictures that were taken by some  people that were there while the police were beating me and listen let me tell you something i have to  give props to them why uh pd simply because they came into a situation that they had no you know no  knowing of what was going on in the beginning so they just did what they had to do you know so i gotta  give them props on that however you're giving props to the guys on the beating they didn't know what 
[00:45:00]  you are on that was a good beating you know all right well honestly they didn't know they came into  a situation you know and then so i ended up in a well i was also and i'm not sure if i went into an  ambulance or a police car but uh there was some uh more uh beat down going down in there basically i got  beat up for about three hours i ended up uh having to come out of hospital without my test shirt they  cut the fucking thing off goddamn shit wait they beat you after they dragged you out of there who 
[00:45:30]  beat you oh yeah man i was beat i was beat all the way to the hospital and even while i was in the  hospital i think they thought i was spitting at them like purposely but because my nose was broken and  the blood was coming and all the pepper spray it was like you know i was all puffy really couldn't  see what's going on i was just trying to get everything out of my mouth so i could breathe  and well they didn't like that too much either who the cops or security i like i said first i didn't 
[00:46:00]  even i didn't know how many cops were on me until my wife told me because uh the security of pepper  sprayed me so at the i think at the point where you guys had noticed ruckus was going on i was already  pepper sprayed so that's why i was such an animal oh and um well anyway i get out of the hospital  and they're like okay you can go now and i'm like well where the hell am i and i didn't know what time  it was you know because my watch had reverted to west coast time i got those uh multi-function 
[00:46:30]  watches and shit you got so i come out of another time zone wow yeah exactly beat you into los angeles  and um i i had to like really put my watch up to my face to see what time it was because every all  the bright lights and everything was it's like real blurry and stuff when i was out yeah and it said  3 15 well in reality it was 6 15 p.m hello p.m or am uh this is uh p.m the show is this all started 
[00:47:00]  right at the end of the show uh so it was three four hours later yeah yeah yeah yeah so then i had  to make my way back to the ferry the cops had told my wife that i was going to be booked which was a  total lie they told me that that she just left me you know so it was kind of like they didn't want  her around to see anything that was going down or whatever the deal was so she's gone i ended up  getting onto the ferry i i didn't i had luckily i had my cash and everything still on me but my cell phone  and everything had come out of my pockets in the initial uh scuffle so she had all of that 
[00:47:30]  shit then i had to get across the ferry to weehawk and now you know the jeep's gone holy  shit she really did go you know so i had to get one of those town cars i live up in sussex county  new jersey up near high point mountain creek that's action park you might know it yeah yeah so that's a  pretty fucking long ride man so the guy turns around 180 he wants to charge me so i was like  shit i ain't got i don't have 180 on me so he hangs up with the dispatcher and he turns around 
[00:48:00]  and going that all right i'll do what do you got i said i got 110 on me so he drove me all the way up  from weehawk in the sussex county for 110 bucks then he turns around and gives me the ten dollars  gives me ten dollars back at the end of it because i was beat up looking he goes man you hungry you  need some food or some sympathy how far of a ride was it from the weehawk in the sussex uh it's probably  about 60 60 miles somewhere in that area that's a long well i was up at like oh by the way it was

[01:07:30]  i think the fcc's got the atomic bomb in that war and uh they'll drop it on you there you go  all right i have an idea for a billboard that you guys would like all right jimmy it's got you two  guys on it right and you're both like looking at a microphone with your hands on your hips  and it says that no and it says opie and anthony dash bring in the funny wow  that's a good yeah that's good right bring in the funny and like we're serious yeah like we brought 
[01:08:00]  it we should maybe have duffel bags that's right like it look it's full of funny and we're bringing  it there's some funny here and guess who brought it oh that's good i'm embarrassed picturing it in my  head why i like it i can't get it out of my head and i'm embarrassed for us and we didn't even do  it that's it you guys in a white box background just looking at a mic that's dangling bring in 
[01:08:30]  some funny bring in the funny look we got it here in our backpacks maybe there's even you each have  backpacks and there's a the back of a brink's truck backed up and it's open and funny's about to spill  out there's a whole lot of funny maybe through a little like it's open a crack the the brink store  and and you could see kind of pouring out a little bit our party hats and wacky horns and confetti  like we're ready to open them up and the funny's just gonna fly out or just words 
[01:09:00]  ha ha ha oh ha ha bringing some funny  you know i gotta tell you it's every radio guy's dream to have a billboard too yeah that is like  their you get very excited of their existence when you see a billboard for your radio show steven jersey  what's up hey what's going on guys you guys rock thanks hey i got a beer and hot wings over here  they got a billboard it says uh good luck howard i think he's gonna need all the luck he can get 
[01:09:30]  does it really wait it actually says good luck howard as far as part of their billboard they  finally get a billboard and that's what they do with it it says beer and hot wings across the top  and then down the bottom big letters says good luck howard that's all about at least five of them  over here in jersey well who's beer what's beer and hot wings that's their name no it's not one guy  is beer and one guy is hot wings because because jimmy who doesn't like beer and hot wings so if you  name yourself that then everyone will like everyone yeah oh man that reminds me of a show that i want 
[01:10:00]  to do just called guy things what guy doesn't like that right they sat there in a meeting probably go  what we call ourselves what you know every guy likes free beer and hot wings yes why don't we just name  ourselves let's name it what guys like uh black eyes and i have sex no no good mark that off the list  but i like free beer and i like hot wings say guys why not who wouldn't listen 
[01:10:30]  so does he have to introduce himself as free beer hey i'm free beer yeah this is like when they come  on be i'm fb when they do their appearances hey everybody how you doing uh i'm free beer this is  hot wings you're gonna be here all day at stereo emporium and uh come on up we have some  more little tchotchkes to give away we have uh free beer and hot wings bumper stickers i'm free 
[01:11:00]  beer this is hot wings don't get us confused  shoot me shoot me in the head where are they based my name is phil or something it's not free  beer my name's eric where are they based like we please see a picture of these two  nothing of free beer and hot and you shouldn't i'm sorry i know nothing of did their billboards  really say good luck howard yeah why would you why how badly do you grovel that you would wish  another guy luck it could be sarcastic which still stinks no i don't think it is i think it's uh 
[01:11:30]  you think they're good-natured kind of guys like eh let's wish him some luck no let's take people  inside the inside the radio how many walls are in this room we're just going to go inside the radio  oh okay they uh this is their logic at that radio station hold on hold on we have to shrink down  all right kids we're inside your radio we're here in the radio 
[01:12:00]  stupid bits let me tell you the logic behind uh free beer and hot wings doing a billboard that  says good luck howard okay i just burnt myself on a tube it's an old radio they got themselves in a  conference room the the the general manager of the station was there the program director was there  and some maybe maybe some other creative people around the station yeah howard's leaving how how  can we take advantage of this why don't we wish him luck are you crazy why would we wish howard  was everyone's expecting us to do the other thing and there's a lot of uh howard listeners out there that 
[01:12:30]  are going to be displaced when he goes to satellite radio why not be the good guys and you wish howard  luck and then those people might want to listen to you because you seem like you're okay because  you're because you're wishing howard uh some uh some luck yeah what a great idea from the uh program director  yeah  that's a great idea next that's the logic there though that is absolutely the logic and i bet you 
[01:13:00]  i bet you free beer and hot wings like hey hey hey and then like the program director wait wait  guys hear me out hear me out yeah that's like a great word it's like a dave douglas meeting all  over again hear me out guys hear me out hear you out these listeners are displaced and they need a  place to go so why not welcome the howard fans by wishing howard good luck right where are they located  we don't know and we don't care i want to be on their show i want to be a part of it i think somewhere in 
[01:13:30]  jersey are they right can someone tell me that's good that's good have a website and it doesn't even  tell uh anyone where you broadcast from let's say hi to ollie in new jersey ollie before you ollie  i just want to say can 101.5 stop broadcasting and fucking echo it stinks i've said it before i'm  going to keep saying as they stop why are you listening to 101.5 once in a while i'll catch traffic  i just thought of i haven't listened to them in six months i just thought of it i listened but but  we have travel we have channels on xm yeah but you don't have carton and rossi and they get things 
[01:14:00]  done well are you uh going to be working for them soon or something no i just thought of the echo  that's something to say well here's what made me think of it because you're talking about the  marketing people yeah i was just thinking about how awful and out of touch some people are on radio  and the fact that that anyone would think that echo sounds good makes the big sound it's  fucking unless i always hated cousin brucey for doing that yeah the big echo you know what our thing was  that we had to do in in boston at waf every time we talked we had to have a music bed under us music 
[01:14:30]  beds remember the music beds we had to play under us the music bed that was so that they could say we  only stopped the rock twice an hour for commercials but we would talk in between that like a lot  especially our show so in order to still be able to say we we only stopped the rock twice an hour  we were rocking underneath what we were saying that's so technically we're still rocking you  hearing music people we're just talking over it i fucking oh hate music beds oh we had them and then 
[01:15:00]  our boss would walk in uh boys you're supposed to play 12 songs an hour boys last hour you played four  and a half yeah bros what are you guys a talk show uh yeah we are one of the stupidest things  ever said to us yeah he actually asked us ding yeah yeah that's what we're attempting to do all  they have to do is say things like that and we could twist it around to mean i think he wants us 
[01:15:30]  to talk more right he wants to make it a talk show he actually said boys what are we a talk show now oh  uh all right bruce well bruce fast forward a few years look what we're doing since you mentioned it  brucey looks like we were onto something back then when you wanted your stupid music beds  12 songs an hour 12 songs an hour where are you today where are you uh boi ollie in jersey what's  up hey boys hello c 100 no slogan but he's got his he's got his fingers in his ear his tongue out 
[01:16:00]  and his eyes crossed when you got comedy like that who even needs a slogan wait a minute wait a minute  who has that finger in the ears i think the only time i'll accept that no i can't miss it all right  oh yeah you can't it was just mean all right thank you ollie the only time i want to see that  if it's a five-year-old on the witness stand all right joe in cleveland funny that is hey joe  morning boys hey happy birthday jimmy oh sir it's not my birthday my birthday is july 19th i'm a cancer 
[01:16:30]  it's not my birthday sir it's not my birthday my birthday is july 19th don't wish me happy birthday  till then all right let's go all right i'll call back there the uh classic rock station here in  cleveland which used to be the stern affiliate and is now the lovely david lee roth show in the morning  um also broadcast that they are high definition radio yeah this is something that um is just uh oh 
[01:17:00]  oh it's just taking off sweeping the um sweeping the uh conference rooms across america this is awful it's um  um high definition radio now everyone can understand high definition television can't you  you turn on a regular channel and look at it then you turn on hd tv it's wider it's so crystal clear  the picture is beautiful it's wonderful but there's no programming i don't want to look at a brook for a  half hour you go to hd hbo watch their movies or you go to have a few shows now you can watch american 
[01:17:30]  idol on all right so they have a few shows but but uh you know yeah let's let's step it up a little  bit but i they they they should the flyovers of norway okay it's exciting the first time you see it  or whatever the hell the flyover is it's crystal clear well wonderful i see the waves of the icy fjords  yeah let's look at a flower a flower yeah a half hour i love those shows that when they show i do 
[01:18:00]  when they fly over alaska it's just music in the background i could watch those shows for hours  i love watching white glaciers falling into the water it is and i mean this it's lovely it's magic  it's majestic boring after five minutes on a regular tv you know yeah timmy tube what do you know we're  members of the flat screen club i got a flat screen finally you got a high def though yes i got a high  def you have a high def box and the wires wired in well i haven't got no you don't exactly you need the  high definition feed it's so wonderful to have i watch everything all i know is they just don't 
[01:18:30]  have enough programming yet but anyway so you got the high def tv tv it's it's an impact it's visual  it's everything high definition radio what the fuck is it doing what is it doing uh supposedly you can get  three radio streams out of one uh radio station now right so you tune to another station right and  you're getting another feed from the same lousy station right what good is that they can't program 
[01:19:00]  one good station now they have to program three and by the way uh it's still under fcc guidelines  right so you're getting nothing extra it's not like satellite so you can't hear who the  fuck are you anymore no you still can't and it doesn't come in on your regular am fm radio i want  to hide death at least with satellite radio you go out and buy the unit you're getting something  different than regular radio this high definition radio and they talk about it on new york radio  message board like it's the second coming all these radio geeks talk about it like like they blow up 
[01:19:30]  they love to blow off satellite radio like ah it's nothing not enough subscribers this that but they  talk about high definition radio like everyone's got it oh it's the wave of the future because of the  future a lot of them are very out of touch on the new york radio message board a lot of them are very  out of touch and they resent the fact that's that that what they love is being seen as a bit  irrelevant and commercially weighed down unless satellites not yep um how would you like it if 
[01:20:00]  you something you put all your your your energy into writing about all of a sudden became irrelevant  dreck i i read i read something once that said um each generation wants to be the last generation  thank you is that true and that's why they have a problem like uh evolving that's why you got  people that uh grew up in the 60s and they think 60s music is all the rage and anything after that  is horseshit every generation wants to be the last generation and that's all the final generation i said 
[01:20:30]  that yeah i thought you meant every generation wants to be the last one generation every generation  wants to be the last generation right i got you and that's and that's the problem you run into in  this world with pop culture and music taste and and and what have you yeah ain't gonna happen  you know but you gotta keep evolving there's still great music being made it's harder to find these  days but it's out there you know uh let's go to eric in michigan eric yes what's up eric hey uh

[01:27:30]  between the uh remaining four teams in the ncaa college basketball championship tournament you want  to go simple we're not allowed to say final four are we shut up jesus are you kidding me what you do for  the trip are you like this isn't obvious to the last quad what is we're calling it the last quad the  last quad it's been known as the final i just made that up since i was two years old how do you 
[01:28:00]  fucking not name but the the the big game the big game the the four remaining it's the  elasto quattro there's a five minus one tournament right the five minus one let's just call it the  final five minus one the two squared how about the two squared then what is this about seriously  xm legal department has to approve the copy to be that way i it's just like jim said the big game  what kind of trouble can you get in i never understood it's like when you say super bowl like you say super 
[01:28:30]  bowl you're promoting the super bowl by saying the super bowl so why is that a problem uh because  they don't want people capitalizing on it but we're getting technically more people to watch the super  bowl by saying hey the super bowl right i mean that's just like that's like the first thing you  learn in advertising and marketing so if attend the games between the remaining four teams  but everyone knows it's a final four and if you say final four maybe more people would watch the final 
[01:29:00]  four because that that is bizarre someone someday has to explain why that's a problem how about this  i never got a good answer on that one the remaining 49 minus 45 teams yeah final all right where are we  at with the uh the four remaining teams uh well a pest and a guest win a trip okay uh you want to go  simple let us know what you would do for the trip we're allowed to say uh ncaa though right college

[01:35:00]  at what time 12 when it's supposed to be there right right i get it so i i lose my mind on the  girl on the phone i lost my mind i go you're kidding me right i go why why do you get you guys can't make  a five hour window on a day you don't even deliver to people so you're saying my thing is the only thing  on this truck and it's driving now from jersey because why why i go i go i go do you understand 
[01:35:30]  you're turning me into a lunatic that i make fun of you are turning me into a nut job right here uh  because of your incompetence uh with your company why don't they just tell you sometime after 12 why  why even give you the hope and i had a call they didn't call me to tell me that they were going to be  late so so uh please tell me you made him come all away and then then reload the truck i was so 
[01:36:00]  good if there would have been one problem so then i i i i'm on the phone with the woman i go let me  speak to ramon because ramon was the head guy there over there in the shipping department and he's the  guy that hooked me up for this special delivery and everything uh they had told me that the truck  left new jersey at noon was stopping for one stop and then we'll be at my house in about an hour  no i don't see that happening uh so i i tried to get ramon and she goes we're trying to get ramon and 
[01:36:30]  then i realized i had ramon's cell phone number so i called ramon and uh ramon was livid he said do  you know how many emails i sent out to uh uh make sure this went off without a hitch and i went well  ramon it's pretty hitchy i said that and i said it's pretty hitchy  and he said let me make some phone calls and he called me back and said the truck will be there in  20 minutes and by the time i got off the phone with him the truck was pulling up like what the 
[01:37:00]  how could it have left your that woman was lying to me liar liar i hope your vagina is on fire  i'm angry why'd she lie i don't know she was lying did she just not know and just say something  because she's yes she didn't know and figured fuck it i'll just lie to this i would have called her  back and called her out on it i was so sick of dealing with them and then i said if there's one  problem with the delivery how it goes uh yeah i'm throwing everyone out with the shotgun i'm just 
[01:37:30]  shooting people how was it uh oh they put down the pads for every screw that had to be installed  making sure it's not to scratch a thing uh and set everything up yeah and then left and i will  never ever deal with them again really yeah just horrible why don't you give the name of the company  now that you're done i don't want to wait until they send me my um gift certificate  i i i would find that i'm never going to use i hope the first time you have sex on that bed all the  legs just get out we actually we were actually joking about that last night i go could you just see 
[01:38:00]  right now like because we were just ready to fall asleep and it's like silence in the bedroom and  i was like could you imagine if the bed just collapsed right now i'm fucking all four legs  big scratch on the floor it's like six legs on this bed because it's a giant king-sized bed and it's big  wooden behemoth of a bed big royalty headboard looks like a king sleeps in this thing it's like one of  those beds that the death scene of a king you know and they're in the bed and people around playing 
[01:38:30]  like you know the king that's what kind of bed this is it's just giant ornate wooden bed fit for a king  or me like tiberius caesar or roman guards in a client smother you with a stocking your tiny little  body they can't even find you oh i know dude i can roll over like eight times and not fall off the 
[01:39:00]  other end of the bed the california king a regular giant it's a goddamn colorado king it's just it's  giant it's a giant bed what is it about a big bed because i have a big king i'm sure yours is larger but  why why as a single guy alone i like a big king there's something warmish about that about wanting  a big safe thing to sleep in i don't like uh i slept on shit beds for my whole life growing a little  twin bed shoved in an attic rented room somewhere where the the middle of it was sagging and uh i'd wind 
[01:39:30]  up falling off of it or you'd feel like the springs poking through and the worst thing is in the summer  or when you when you're you're hot there's no way to get out of your own hot your own heat in a big bed  if you heat up an area and you wake up and you're hot you could roll over a little to another cooler  area of the bed or put the air on well yes you can also do that but sometimes you don't have air 
[01:40:00]  conditioning jimmy i have a weird thing where i can turn my vent all the way to the right and make it  cool but it's no ac it's like if the building has heat i can oh you're on building schedule  that's what i had in my goddamn apartment fuck buildings you're on their schedule do you know  you can't get air conditioning until a certain date that's what and you can't get heat until  a certain day they decide all right on such and such a day in the fall that's when heat starts and  then such and such a day when the springs up that's when ac starts and you can't you can't 
[01:40:30]  turn on the ac right now it really annoys me because my old environment i could yep now you  can't you can't but i wanna  what are you reading sweet potato i'm just trying to read some instant feedback oh i had nothing to  add no more conversation so i was trying to get something there was something there trying to get  some mysteries you can't figure out on that thing i have no idea what's going on all right here we go  so we got the qvc guy calling uh a guy calling qvc about uh how he loves uh his dell for porno right

[01:43:00]  an excuse i just woke up it's not that i don't enjoy the show hi guys can i help  what's going on eager jizz bucket you're on the phone a little eagerness there right yeah i hate  the eagerness i haven't been listening i was actually i just woke up a little while ago what's  going on yeah i know life of a comic yeah i'm just a loser uh dice uh allow me um uh norton he was  telling a cute little story you get you're coming back from a gig from jersey i don't even know where  you bother showing a girl is nibbling on your hog let's say uh-huh but she likes to have her head  under the steering wheel yes so she can't get her head up yes and what were you doing while this was 
[01:43:30]  happening probably tickling my nipples no no no no no no wait what were you drinking don't  oh you're not okay oh you're gonna get away with that six years ago all right wait wait wait wait  wait you can't just casually say that like it's normal you you do the you you do that no i just  did it to be silly that's pretty silly you know what i mean sometimes you're in a goofy mood you're  like ah why not right yeah but why do you think you can't get sick from that um i don't know it hasn't 
[01:44:00]  happened yet i mean obviously it was quite a few years ago so i'm okay but i really didn't think at the  moment yeah but have you done it since uh not like that no i'm like you know i mean not like  that well he had a wine glass he takes it right out of the tap now yeah actually i think i think  there might be contaminants in the cup yeah you don't want to get sick for maybe the cup not being  washed yeah exactly there may have been coffee in there earlier i forgot what i had in there earlier  so you were really sipping it out of a wine glass yeah yeah just well i was actually i believe a paper 
[01:44:30]  cup i don't remember oh my god all i remember it was a wine glass you told me it very well may have been  if i told you that then that's what it was if it was a jet mug who knows what i do not a whole  story could be a lie well now believe me i never lie about a tinkle drink drinking out but one thing i  do remember though is what's going to my mind while this is happening is like what happened to my life  that i'm enjoying this and you enjoyed it well yeah i guess so yeah norton yes sir wait wait wait wait  all the time what's that don't i talk to you all the time about like these crazy things you do yeah i 
[01:45:00]  know you always try to mellow me out you do yeah that like you know you know you know normal sex  like just to uh as i said earlier to take your sap sock and bang it against some chick's ass that's a  normal thing you know what i mean right you know as you bury the mule in her pinot pocket well i do  enjoy doing that as well yeah but that's like normal all right his idea of sex is something completely  different to clean you up clean getting cleaned up after was like a nice shower i know after sex i 
[01:45:30]  smell like an alley god damn man norton yeah right well we gotta don't you think that's gonna  dement you in the long run it probably i mean i imagine it's not emotionally healthy but why do  you think he twitches so much i know i got i got problems i tried it though i normal norton  norton now you're picking on a confliction hold on you know what i mean yeah that's a confliction  you don't make fun of people's confliction you know when people limp or uh twitch you know that's 
[01:46:00]  a good that's a normal like uh you know a little confliction he's got right all right wait let me in  on on this here uh norton yes what's the turn on with the urine i you know what it's not even it  wasn't even the urine it was just the idea that i was doing something so awful yeah just so wrong  it's like naughty that got you going yeah just beyond naughty and it wasn't you know it was just a  thing i don't know why i did it you know you do silly things sometimes like i said you know  once in a while you're feeling kind of kooky so you know you do something different silly is like 
[01:46:30]  that's not normal that's right you know this is a guy that goes to dinner at morton's and goes  yeah give me the steak a baked potato and uh what do i want to drink uh give me a bottle of  yeah well no i don't have it with dinner ever ever never with dinner that's disgusting and  tasteless only during right norton yes sir that's bizarre man silly is like you know you're on like a  uh a public boss and your moon maybe silly's not like drinking i don't know i just kind of thought  i fell into the classification of silly you may be correct all right we're uh we're listening to  the first time jim norton called the show really and as i'm hearing it i'm thinking that's not that 
[01:47:00]  bad a call it's very good it's funny but it's obvious to me and anthony that that's not the  first time anyone called our radio that isn't the first time holy shit i would like to know the  first call in who how would i know that you twitch so much right if i've never met you yet  and it didn't this is what's kind of tipped me off a little bit because i went uh hey uh yeah i'm  not listening like like i had spoken you he didn't introduce me to you no no here comes iraq to explain 
[01:47:30]  all right with his walk-on music that we haven't played in a while because he's usually in studio but  he's out of studio today because he's working out worst of when we go on vacation hi iraq hi now um  who was responsible i love asking who first who was responsible for finding jim norton's first  appearance first phone call to the opian anthony show go that would be me all right and you found  this call that we just played yes now what made you think that was the first phone call from jimmy 
[01:48:00]  because i asked jim i said was all right okay wait wait wait wait now ladies and gentlemen i want to  introduce you to the passing of the buck they see i that's why i i love doing this i love seeing when  the exact moment of the past comes and that was it folks you just heard it okay but i i've double  checked with with several people as far as like you was this the phone call was this phone call  everyone's like yeah i believe that was the phone call okay do you understand there's a columbo  moment in there yeah why not use your brain uh obviously if he knew he twitched he couldn't 
[01:48:30]  possibly have the only thing i'm alive it's so obvious this isn't the first phone call right  possible that dice might have told you guys he twitches he's a nice i'll tell you what happened  i hope he saw you twitching i i i'm not positive but i this is a call in that happened after your  first studio appearance okay and we were talking to dice from la he's probably promoting some kind  of comedy show and then we started talking about you and and he said something like you got to call 
[01:49:00]  him because he likes to drink urine and he didn't tell you guys that when he was in studio yeah so then  this was a way of getting another story out of jim norton that we just met this is so obvious that it's  not the first one something tells me that i did a bit the first time i call that's which is why i  don't think this is the first one no it's definitely not i've also i know this is too comfortable and  also because you weren't really familiar with the show when we first talked to you okay this is obvious  that now you're kind of part of the show and stuff you've been on before that you're now taking more of 
[01:49:30]  a an interest in the program that's why he said in the beginning well i'm not i didn't let i haven't  listened yet today i also say in that call um that jimmy uh he's not into like normal sex like  he's he's so out there just knew too much about like yeah and i wouldn't have said that with just  the one thing that you talk about tinkle drinking and and that totally puts you off of normal sex you  know obviously we had talked and here's another thing this is the first time i'm hearing this since  it went down yeah i remember that jimmy kind of bombed the first time he was on our show oh boy he's 
[01:50:00]  not bombing here this is good radio this is a good story it's interesting it's sick it's silly  and jimmy then because jimmy doesn't bomb the first time you even admitted it was like it was like you  were uncomfortable and we were pretty much like ah well well we gotta let you go remember it was like  kind of awkward and so they're telling us uh you gotta go with it yeah no we got they're saying you got  to uh and i probably thought wow they're talking about me they're saying i gotta go i'm busy right  i think i actually remember the first time jim was on the phone believe it or not and i think 
[01:50:30]  i think he and dice were together somewhere there was no we aren't i i know i was up i was inside  park i remember the i remember what i was looking at honestly i think dice was in studio and said  you've got to call this jimmy guy no dice on the phone i'm almost positive i think that's on the  phone as well he's on the phone yeah i think he got in touch with you and then had you call the show  yeah that's exactly what happened that this could be it but i just it something about it doesn't ring  that's not it correct with me i how would i know you twitched i know if i never met you before  definitely well was his first call after his first appearance or did he call for an appearance 
[01:51:00]  you can ask me i'm right here i'm not dead i was uh really yes he's talking about like i'm an old  person well did little jim no i was off can we put him in the home for a little less money well  let's now let's let's make sure something we'll listen to the first appearance and see if i  discussed the urine there i don't think i did i do remember about the first in studio i was there  for three hours i hadn't said much i had a gig in connecticut for 150 dollars i was gonna leave  and go do it right and i'm like you dumb motherfucker you're on new york radio show 
[01:51:30]  with dice what are you stupid for 150 bucks you're gonna walk away from like being jake off but you  know what i mean i almost that last hours when i actually did well i was very quiet up till then i  almost left without saying a fucking word well we got more of the first call in here that's not the  first call in unfortunately which makes this much less exciting no now it's kind of fun because let's  pick out little things that prove that it isn't the first so far there's two right yeah because i had  i would have no idea that he twitched a lot yeah and what was yours and mine was just that was a 
[01:52:00]  little too familiar with the fact that his sexual history as far as sex goes yeah can you tell the  story um that you told us backstage at the dice show at the garden which one was that a couple ladies  all right you are the dumbest fucking guy i've ever worked with well backstage holy  shit i am so fucking frustrated oh no oh no there it is the first sentence wow talk about a you have  no fucking idea how enraged i am right now hold we've been looking for jim norton's first phone call 
[01:52:30]  to this radio program and you think this is it remember people duck and cover  duck and cover when obi gets pissed off use your brain you got a good brain why don't you ever use  it and i'm not even i'm i'm not even doing a radio thing anymore i'm i'm stupefied how could this be  his first call if we've been hanging out stupefied him this was backstage after backstage at the garden

[01:57:00]  two girls well he was talking in the vehicle but he would have i didn't care if he did we just  would have giggled about it later now you know the word giggled you would have giggled about it  that's what we would have done a lot of people want to back up to that story where the girl's uh  you know nibbling on your hog with her head's under the steering wheel and you're and you're uh  sipping your own you're on my own wait a minute that would be sick if it was his own excuse me 
[01:57:30]  god no no i'm not shipwrecked the girl likes her head under the wheel because she can't get her  head out yeah yeah yeah that was a girl i came in between the how do you make a turn it well i  wasn't driving i would i would park the vehicle in a quiet deserted air i would no i would never  drive like that oh i thought you were driving on the freeway no no i've received oral treats  while driving but no there's there's never any real dominance when that's happening i'm too  worried about traffic and being pulled over wow i'm not shipwrecked that's a god i didn't 
[01:58:00]  even hear that the first time around took me years to hear that joke and appreciate it  what am i shipwrecked jimmy's very comfortable on our program this is not the first call  the search continues i think we've determined yeah the search continues for the first phone call  i will confess um i must confess i will confess one fib i told at that time not a big one it was to  protect somebody the uh the tinkle i drank out of the paper cup it was a paper cup was uh somebody  i had dated long term i didn't but i again for anonymity reasons i respect somebody's anonymity 
[01:58:30]  the other girl who i used to trap her head under the steering wheel was a girl you guys met  uh she was uh uh i think you met her she was a british girl i dated and um she was extremely a  complete sub and she used to like me to park and um i would put her head under the steering wheel  so she couldn't physically lift her head out and i would like force her to lick my ass and  suck my wow and i would bite her i would lean over and take her shirt off and bite her back and her  whole back would be marked um i would grab a fist she loved it she was a real sub i would hold her 
[01:59:00]  hair and she would try to pull her head up and i just wouldn't let her and i would lean over and bite  her every time she tried to to get up and uh she was a fucking fuck dude she was a real she would start  to get into this thing i want you to bite me i want you i want to suck your cock i want you to  bite me she would just repeat herself it was like a weird trance happens she was a submissive  over there i wish i knew because i loved it for those of you that missed this conversation look for 
[01:59:30]  it uh marked as first call from jimmy yes any w where um jim discusses pope adam in new york what's up  good morning boys hey happy birthday jimmy it's my birthday today too so we can share birthdays it's  not my birthday who am i happy typing jimmy yeah i i tell you i'm a new fan since uh getting the xm  but i've heard that on onlyvirus.com they have the first call i've heard it before well well we'll  have to look there i don't know where you i think he rocks a dumb ass well whoever runs who's the guy 
[02:00:00]  who runs fedex runs oh a virus yeah does he know where it is i mean i'm sure we've asked him but i'm  certain if it exists and it is on these sites it will be emailed to steve promptly i'm sure that  would have been the first place that e-rock would have went to right i don't know the keeper of all  shows oavirus.com i think it's just anything labeled jimmy phone call well now throw it up in the air  whichever one hits the ground first this isn't as special but it's but um we still have more of your 
[02:00:30]  first uh your first wink wink phone call here it is also known as the 12th phone call uh the hooker  with butterscotch pudding story oh yeah jesus all right just to get off of that story for a minute  yeah tell them the tell them the hooker story where you drove home with your hand out the window for  an hour and a half in the freezing cold oh god that was awful all right wait i just without even  knowing what you're about to say i just started dry heaving yeah believe me it's not an enchanting 
[02:01:00]  story holy ass no no he he goes it was just it was a lady of the evening who looked like she she asked  me if i wanted company and i'm like wow that sounds terrific thank you so she got in  and she's performing oral treats on me uh very well i might add and i'm rubbing her exactly i'm rubbing  her cheeks you know because again i don't put fingers in that's just you know it's just a little too  weird you know how you sniff flowers yeah well that face you make it wasn't quite like that 
[02:01:30]  because i was in the driver's seat relaxing and and let's just say that the other person was doing  something for a fee that i was finding enjoyable and sometimes you uh you know how you relax and you  put your hand on somebody's hip when they're doing things for a fee and you know there's a couple of  little cheeks there you'll just pat them gently well once in a while people are not quite hygienic  in certain backdoor areas right and uh you may you may remove your fingers and find something that  resembles butterscotch pudding check check please i'm out of here and then when driving home uh waitress 
[02:02:00]  i'll take the check then when driving home in january despite the cold you realize it is more pleasant  to hang your your your pudding covered finger out the window than have it in the vehicle something  tells me it didn't have the fragrance or flavor of butterscotch but not at all but the consistency was  there apparently she had the flu that could be the most disgusting thing we've ever heard how do 
[02:02:30]  you think i felt i paid to have that so i had a dirty hand and less money oh wow good now now you said  you didn't really get by the exact exit so this stuff was lurking around the area well sometimes you'll see  an exit and you'll stop very briefly and just look and go nah and then keep going right but by that  time there's already like say there's been an oil spill on the ground at the exit you realize that your  vehicle has picked up some of that oil spill right okay wait a minute it's always nice to give an 
[02:03:00]  analogy like that that you can do over the radio i'm so happy with myself what's that dice we're talking  about cars no not really no no you lost me now because it's like how many are you talking about  you know uh pudding somehow this girl got pudding stuck uh on her rear butterscotch pudding all right  listen listen the listeners are going nuts people are just uh calling up saying i'm retching i'm puking 
[02:03:30]  cut it out stop yeah see that's not a good image for me well how do you think i feel i mean these are  these are just stories they're getting nauseous this is my life did that even wash off yeah believe  me it did i had that purell stuff in the car yeah that you clean your hands with that wouldn't even  do the trick like acetone or something i don't know what she eats but i wish she would change her diet  because that was extraordinarily what you've gone to see her again no and i hope she's dead as we speak  i don't know her name but i don't care for her at all that's not a good attitude that's amazing that was 
[02:04:00]  very icky how are you not aware of what he says like when he's doing a uh uh like sniff routine  the flower sniff right like even if it's a little taut right right he's got to stay in there because  you got to be a team player yeah you got to be a good guy you got to be a team player what are you  going to do even if it's a little like taut or like tarnish you know what i mean taut what are you  going to do if it's the fourth quarter and your team is down by three and your uniform's a little 
[02:04:30]  dirty you can't just go hey i got to sit on the bench you know you gotta get out dives in there  yeah i'm a good guy i care about people that's the way i deal with things i don't want to embarrass  somebody turn it off please turn it off some guy saying he uh he can probably still smell it under  his fingernail no no believe me i was i washed quite thoroughly i was like an obsessive compulsive  under i could not stop washing my hands and then everything smells fine and then an hour later 
[02:05:00]  you go back and go god it's back well it's like a bad car accident you just can't you can't stop  sniffing even though you know it's going to be horrendous you just keep sniffing yeah he taught me  the sniff though it's not out of pleasant though the the sniff that i've told you about was out of  pleasantries and like everybody's having a good time and i'm glad to be alive that thing i do when i  perform that that face yeah it's just that perfect awful face yeah it's disgusting there you go  there you go oh that's a great story completely true horrid uh let's go to matt in dc hey matt 
[02:05:30]  what's up today check please opie that's not a douche check please you know what that's nothing wait  till you hear the first time anthony and i did a show together you'll hear some stuff a lot worse than  checks me check please that's i'm leaving right right please hey we're on regular radio we couldn't  you know we didn't hear us dancing that was a dance around that that shit we were talking about  jimmy and and jimmy's there telling a story about a woman and a shit coming out of her ass and getting

We hope.  This isn't as exciting as doing it the way we wanted to do it. 
[02:14:30]  First phone call and then first in studio.  See, it would have been good.  Would have been nice.  It would have been good that way.  Here's Jimmy in studio with us for the first time.  Can I say something?  You know, you had a stranger let a gay guy...  Tell them who Frantic Fran was.  They don't know who Frantic Fran was.  That's true.  Oh, so I'm actually going to explain why we have to hear this underwater.  I know.  What a disaster of a bit this turned out to be.  This was supposed to be gold. 
[02:15:00]  What happened?  What happened?  Sounds like Perrier Kenny.  I'm sitting here thinking, well, at least we got the first in studio.  Yeah.  But now we got to hear it all muddy and like we're underwater.  It's crap.  I wish I didn't break Steve's copy.  It was probably better.  Frantic Fran was some old broad.  You got your copy on the floor still?  Maybe Steve's.  Oh, you could probably salvage this.  Put that in and just listen to it.  Oh, my God.  That broke up real nice. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, I just think it'd be really funny to hear the smash.  I don't even know.  Frantic Fran was like, what, 80-something years old?  She was in her 80s and she was with some really old guy who she was dating.  I don't even know what she did, Frantic Fran.  She was like, she played the piano and stuff.  Did she?  And told jokes, I think.  I do something to her the other day.  Yeah.  At least we could do is get a stranger to give oral treats to our opening act.  Yeah, our opening act.  Hey, forget that.  Dice.  Hi, where's Fran?  Yeah.  Who am I talking to?  Dice, Dice, your friend Happy Face. 
[02:16:00]  How'd he get that name?  Was it when you were stuck in his seat?  Look, he doesn't even radio contact.  He's blood.  You see, even those radio technologies.  Wow.  Who's that guy now?  What?  That's superstar Jim Norton, the opening act.  Oh, that's Jim.  Yeah.  Of course.  Well, there you go.  That proves more of my point, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's Jim.  Who didn't know?  It's like brand new.  Right?  But at first call, he references that we're hanging out backstage. 
[02:16:30]  Maybe it's me.  I don't know.  Jim.  Yeah.  Of course.  Let him sit down, Kenny.  Jim's been here for an hour and a half.  You're opening act, and you don't even get him on the radio?  Wait a minute.  If you guys are the stars of the garden.  Yeah.  And I'm this, what am I again?  Special guest.  What's my part?  Special guest.  I'm the special guest.  Which means you have to work a lot harder than us.  No, no.  We just show up and sit. 
[02:17:00]  So what, if, you know, there's time, he could go on.  Maybe do a few minutes.  He can do a few minutes.  He needs special girls.  He needs special girls with special talents.  Friend?  Okay.  Special girls.  He's heavy into urine.  Say when.  Oh, wait.  You told me that Jim's into some sick ass.  Yeah, go ahead.  What about friend?  No, I don't want to bang Ben Franklin.  Oh, Kelly.  No, I'm kidding.  You gave me that, you know.  That's not right, Jimmy.  Come on, respect.  I didn't mean that.  Come on, a little respect.  Come on.  You're just in Kelly for a long time.  I'm all over him.  I'm just, it's not right. 
[02:17:30]  I'm horny.  It's not right.  It's shaved.  It looks like an alien's mouth.  She hates me.  The old lady hates me.  Yeah.  I'd like to run my fingers through that bald head of yours.  Oh, and na-na.  And na-na.  And na-na.  And na-na.  And na-na.  And na-na.  And na-na.  And na-na.  And na-na.  And na-na.  Yeah.  Right through the cerebellum.  And na-na.  Right through your cerebellum. 
[02:18:00]  And na-na.  I'm being scalded by a dollar bill.  If you're happy and you know it, have a stroke.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hey.  Hey.  This is Fran.  Jim Norton, ladies and gentlemen.  Wait till you have one.  Let's get to know Jimmy.  What's he about?  F.  Let me make the face.  This is the face. 
[02:18:30]  You ready for the face?  Yeah.  What is this?  The face of?  The hands.  Tell them what it is.  The sniff.  The sniff of what?  The cheeks.  Between the cheeks.  See, my parents are listening to this?  Do the hands.  What's with the hands?  I have to open it.  He's very nervous.  His parents are actually coming to the garden to watch him perform, and he's awful.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't mean he's a scumbag.  I'm a scumbag, and they're going to see it.  Yeah.  They're going to see what he's really like.  I never used profanity.  Growing up, I wasn't allowed.  Because if I ever used profanity, my dad would drag me into the bathroom and wash out my mouth  with his penis. 
[02:19:00]  I like Jim Norton, man.  Thank you.  You like him, right?  Yeah, he's hilarious.  Yeah, very funny.  He's effed off, but he's hilarious.  Yeah, well, he's got a lot of problems.  A lot of issues.  I see that by looking at him.  He's a psychopath.  He's got a lot of issues.  Tinkle issues.  You like the tinkle?  You like...  He likes the tinkle.  He likes a bucket of it.  Yeah, it's nice.  What is that?  Look at him.  He's getting all excited.  You like the golden shower thing?  Yes.  Through all your ears, Frank.  Fran.  Frank.  Frank.  Frank.  Fran, did a guy ever request that you tinkle all over him for any reason? 
[02:19:30]  When it still came out in liquid form.  Jesus.  Holy cow.  You're so rotten.  I apologize.  Your parents are listening to me.  Don't ever apologize.  No, my parents are listening.  Look how he says parents.  Parents.  His parents are listening.  So, Oklahoma or something?  Yeah, where are you from?  Where is he from?  Wait, did Fran...  He's worried about his parents.  Did Fran answer the question?  Parents.  It would come out like icing.  Vanilla icing. 
[02:20:00]  Nice.  Oh.  I got in there nice and you.  I'll tell you something.  Like a marshmallow Sunday, but it was a Monday.  Ooh, that's syphilis.  Hey, Ant is just in.  Yeah.  Fran?  Yeah.  Opening up for Dice at the Garden.  With her organ.  She'd actually be great.  You know what?  Wouldn't that be good?  She'd get a standing ovation.  You should sit up outside.  Oh, good.  We'll give you a couple t-shirts and draw them out.  You can tinkle on Norton.  Play taps on the organ.  Playing the piano now. 
[02:20:30]  I thought we went to the motion.  I so thought we were done with the organ.  Did you say?  What is it?  Ricky?  Ricky, what is it?  What are you doing?  Christopher Reeve plays the piano better.  Todd, what are you doing over there?  Who said that?  Who said that?  I can't hear.  It was Norton who said that.  Jimmy.  Clay?  Clay said that?  Yeah.  Norton, the psychopath.  Oh, the guy with the parents?  Yes.  That narrows it down.  The guy with the parents, yeah.  Oh, I see.  Do you sing?  Do you sing?  I'd like to accompany you.  Do you got like a lot of pains?  Pains?  Yeah.  I'm always going to doctors for stuff. 
[02:21:00]  Who said?  Me.  Stop with that.  Stop with the piano.  It's like the cow said, shoot the other to me, my daughter.  What's the matter?  You don't know one other from the other?  Who said what the who now?  All right, listen.  Who said what the who?  Shut up, Demi.  Let's get the hell out of here.  Who said what the who about what?  One cow said to the other, shoot the other to me, my daughter, and give the other other  to my brother.  What's the matter?  You don't know one other from the other?  Write that down for me.  This show has pain.  Somebody get me a knife.  I want to cut her. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  Very good.  There you have it.  Jim Norton's first appearance on your program.  Jimmy had some funny lines, man.  Very good.  What a dick I was.  I had to leave for part of that.  I was phoning in a complaint to the FCC.  Jesus Christ.  How did we get away with any of that?  I don't know.  Any of it.  Wash my mouth out with his penis?  How did that get through?  Holy shit.  It was a different time.  The urine drinking?  It was a different time.  It certainly was.  Plus, it was only New York, too.  We were under the radar. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  We got away with murder.  Certainly did.  We'll be the first to admit that.  Wow.  And Howard got away with murder.  That's why it's so funny when he bitches about the FCC.  We all got away with murder.  We know that.  Yeah.  The shit we were able to do because no one really cared.  No one really cared, you know.  Might get a complaint, but never got a fine.  I understand, though, that as a special surprise, Eric is digging up my 43rd in-studio appearance.  Actually, we got the third time you called from L.A.  Ready to go.  Ooh.  That's a rare one.  Fan found it. 
[02:22:30]  He really did.  It's ready to go here, but it's 18 minutes long.  We better not do that.  Spies, Collins.  But I remember the first time was really uncomfortable.  And there weren't many laughs to be had, but there was something that we just needed to know more about.  Well, you also, guys, at that time, loved Dice.  And it was, you know what I mean?  He was a big name coming on the show.  And he was talking me up really well.  That's why I want to hear the first call, because I'm wondering how bad was it, really?  Because we always talk about, like, oh, man, the first time I was on the show, it was awful, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, it was okay.  It was just...  But I bet you there were some laughs in there.  I'm sure there were.  I just don't remember anymore, and I guess we're not going to know.  Nah.  All right.  Lazlo...  D-Rock's coming in with our first call.  He's just editing out the parts where we talk about Brokeback Mountain.  Wait a minute, Ant.  See, that wouldn't be the...  Oh, ah, sorry.  Lazlo outside the studio.  He'll join the program next.  If there's one up there in one of those cams, then I don't know what you're thinking to turn a camera on. 
[02:23:30]  If that's what you look like, fucking put a camera on the cat box.  Pal talk is a big part of our show now.  Some girl is combing her hair for hours, and some mom is putting on socks.  Isn't it wonderful?  A girl combing her hair is very attractive, so I can watch that, because there are at least a bosom swell in the shot. 
[02:24:00]  You know, when you comb your hair for that long...  Yes, Lazlo?  Yeah.  When you comb your hair for that long...  There may be issues.  Yeah, it's long, it's knotted.  Issues, schmishues.  Exactly.  All right, let's get right into it.  As long as you're not brushing your pubes.  Lazlo's here.  We were counting on the last segment to really up the quality of today's program.  And we fell miserably.  Oh, the Jimmy's first appearance?  That was supposed to be one of those home run bits.  Ah. 
[02:24:30]  It was still interesting, but...  Happens.  Holy crap, what a clusterfuck.  All right, Lazlo in studio.  He's got lots of stuff to talk about today.  I think I'm going to try to bring a PalTalk camera on the ship.  Yeah?  By the way.  Because I do have internet access on the ship.  Ooh.  So I think it would be interesting to have maybe a beautiful balcony view.  so people can play along at home and watch me cruise to faraway warm lands 
[02:25:00]  as you are here in New York freezing your asses off.  Why don't you put it in your millionaire suite?  Um, because I'm there for fun and privacy.  Well, you don't have to leave it on all the time.  I just want to see you walking around in your underpants.  You want to see me walking around in my tighty-whities and skippies.  Off underwear.  And wearing nothing but a skipper's hat.  Look, I'm the captain.  You ever see Q&A?  Captain left a sinking ship.  And he smacks the gay guy in the face and fucking chokes him.  Got disgusted by all the cornhole that was going on. 
[02:25:30]  Fucking Nick Galtby's best performance.  All right, let's get into this, Lazlo.  What do you got for us today?  Do you really want internet access on your boat trip?  We have it.  It's on, in all the suites.  They have internet access, yeah.  I flew, I guess it's the first airline that has internet access in the air.  How'd that go for you?  Lufthansa.  It was amazing.  See, that's something that you want while you're flying is internet.  Yeah, an eight-hour plane flight.  Sure. 
[02:26:00]  You can...  Lufthansa has it?  Yeah.  Do they have plugs for your laptop?  No.  That's the problem.  Where do they fly to?  So your battery runs out.  Yeah, that's...  Um, Germany.  Germany.  Yeah.  Germany.  That's the big heist.  They stole a bunch of laptop cords.  So if you want to go to fuck a chicken, Lufthansa's your airline.  But I brought you a housewarming gift, and I know how well gifts are received on this  show, but I was in an establishment last week enjoying a fine beverage, a place where  a certain individual raised a glass in the air and made some great speeches. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, okay.  Maybe fired a few rounds into the ceiling to make a point.  Sure.  Um, founded a party.  Uh-huh.  Socialist Workers' Party.  Oh, wow.  It's a mug from the Hofbrauhaus, where Hitler used to make mini-speeches.  Wow.  So...  This is wonderful.  When it's two in the morning, you can...  I'm sure you have them all memorized by heart.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's always nice to have a visual reminder. 
[02:27:00]  That is something...  Laszlo, thank you very much.  Sure.  That's exactly what he needed.  Really?  Thanks.  We're trying to get him away from that.  Holding a nice, strong lion symbol.  Holding a warm beer.  Just like...  Like A.H. used to drink it.  How did he talk so fiery without spilling it?  That's great.  I'm going to have to hide this when the neighbors come by.  By the way, the neighbors came by. 
[02:27:30]  Ooh.  Really?  Ding dong.  What the...  And I'm hearing some talking.  And I hear my girlfriend's downstairs.  She answered the front door.  And I look down the stairs, and I see this guy's, I don't know, middle-aged dude.  A little paunched to him.  Balding gray hair.  And his wife.  And this little kid.  And they come up and go, hey, where are your neighbors? 
[02:28:00]  And you know they were debating.  I played it all out of my head.  Dude, I played it all out afterwards.  You know they were debating in their house.  All right.  How much time before we go over there and introduce ourselves?  Totally.  When it was all over, I sat there, me and my girlfriend, and we were talking about it.  She's going, you know, what was the process there?  Do you think they went, I think we ought to say hi?  Or is it, hey, we better check out who's next door?  We have children.  You know, what was the motivation?  What spurred it?  They said they were off to a movie, which kind of gave them an out. 
[02:28:30]  So if they were to be invited in, they could leave to go to a movie, if that was their motivation.  You didn't invite them in.  It was so awkward.  No, you didn't invite them in.  I didn't know what to do.  Right.  So at one point, my girlfriend said, like.  You actually had to socialize with real people?  And she kind of looked like, you know, you want to come in?  We really got nowhere to sit, or boxes all over the place and stuff.  And they're like, no, no, we're going to the movies.  We just want to introduce ourselves.  And they introduce themselves. 
[02:29:00]  And then the father goes, you need any help?  Don't hesitate to give me a call.  I know how to hang a few things.  Why don't you start with yourself?  Yeah.  All that I could think of when he said that was his basement and young children swinging from their necks.  That's your neighbor.  I know how to hang a few things.  I bet you do.  But he was the, you know, hey, how you doing?  And he's the guy I saw, you know, shooting some hoops with his son in the driveway and stuff. 
[02:29:30]  Just the typical suburban dad.  You know, he was the one that was picked.  He was the one that was picked.  You think they had a little meeting in the neighborhood?  I didn't even think of that.  And now the wife is calling the rest of the households now to give them the full update.  The update?  What could they give?  He's an Italian.  I know.  He's a Canadian, a Catholic, not Jewish.  What was the ethnicity of these?  They're all Jews.  I live in a completely Jewish neighborhood.  That's it.  Not Indians, not nothing.  They are all Jews.  And me. 
[02:30:00]  And the guy came out, but I didn't think of that, that maybe they sent them on a little mission.  And now, though, I'm at the point now where it's wave at the guy, guy.  Like, because he pulled out of his driveway at the same time I'm pulling out, and now we give each other the little wave.  Hey, how you doing, neighbor?  And he waves to me.  Pulls out in a nice, you know, Lexus and stuff, and I'm pulling out and waving to each other.  I love the suburbs. 
[02:30:30]  Do they know who you are?  But no.  No, that'll ruin everything.  What are you going to tell them you do?  I don't know.  Did we ask?  No.  It was a very short thing, but it was like I said.  I said, well, when we get everything, you know, when we get some furniture and stuff, I'll have you over, you know, kind of thing.  But what do you do?  Because the first conversation you get is, so what do you do?  I work.  You know, he's probably, you know, some kind of finance thing, a banker, money lender.  Tell me what's in media relations.  All right.  But, you know, what do I say? 
[02:31:00]  Media relations?  Say, sir, what do you do besides control the media and world banks?  So what are you talking about?  But the other thing is, now, suburbia is very nosy, which is good because it keeps the crime out.  But they also see me leave at an ungodly hour, or maybe they don't, early in the morning.  You're an Italian leaving at an ungodly hour.  I leave at an ungodly hour.  Oh, they are just freaked out.  Then, dude, I pull up 11.30, I'm home for the day.  All right, done for the day.  I'm done for the day. 
[02:31:30]  And that's it.  I'm done.  Oh, my God.  I can only, what are they thinking?  My God, they're looking through the window.  It only works for a couple of hours a day.  You should just unload shovels every day.  11.30.  Like in the middle of the night.  Not even.  A lot of rolled up carpets.  Yeah, right.  And then I'm out to my Escalade, throw them in the back.  Pull out real slow.  How you doing?  You want to give me a hand with this?  No.  You should really just freak him out. 
[02:32:00]  People in the neighborhood are talking about how you were standing out front going,  get your fucking bedroom suit, put it on the fucking truck and get out of here.  Oh, that's true, yeah.  The scene with the furniture company where they loaded furniture in and then a few minutes  later loaded the same furniture back out onto the truck and left.  Yeah, you know, I didn't think of that.  Like, I have certain stereotype views of Jewish people in my neighborhood and they're mostly  positive because it's great for the neighborhood, the value and the security and stuff like  that.  But I'm sure they have certain stereotypes about Italians. 
[02:32:30]  They can't be happy.  They only work at 5.30 in the morning.  That only work a couple of things, drive a black Escalade and just kind of don't have  a real job.  Kind of work in a few hours, home every day by 11.30.  Obviously, I'm doing well for myself.  Oh, can you imagine the chatter that's going on behind your back?  Apparently, the realtor told me it was a record-breaking sale in the area.  So, obviously, I'm doing well for myself.  I don't work.  I'm Italian.  Oh, this could be good.  I could have fun with this one.  Just start piling burlap sacks into the bag. 
[02:33:00]  Burlap sacks.  And just shovels at 5.30 in the morning.  Really get them guessing.  Or say, look, if someone comes around asking questions, just tell them I'm not home.  Just say I'm not home.  And you know how you came over to say hi and stuff?  You didn't even do that.  You didn't talk to me.  You don't know me at all from a hole in the wall.  So, what was talked about?  Nothing, really.  Just how he can hang a few things or two.  Introduced me to him, his wife, and one of his sons, I guess, who's about, I don't know,  looked about eight. 
[02:33:30]  But then I noticed there's a couple other kids.  They have a trampoline in their backyard.  And the little kids were jumping on the trampoline.  Please let us know the day that it turns and he absolutely hates you or you hate him.  I'll keep you updated on the progress of this relationship.  Because the whole neighbor thing happens exactly like that.  But it always ends bad.  Let me tell you about me, though.  They always turn into being the asshole.  I know.  I made a vow many years ago.  I have my friends I don't need anymore. 
[02:34:00]  I got Joe Curry.  I got Adam Ferrara.  I got a few other friends, Bill Brady, things like that.  Have them all.  Don't want new ones.  Don't need new ones.  Don't have the energy to build up new relationships like that.  I have work acquaintances that I consider friendly.  But the truth of the matter is, if this job fell apart, you know, I'm looking at Stinky over there in the office.  Derek, love you.  But, you know, you'd just be another Stinky.  Ooh.  You know how many beers me and Stinky tipped back, hung out, cigarettes we smoked in the office? 
[02:34:30]  It's friendly, but not a friendship.  I don't want new friends.  So the neighbor thing to me is completely new.  I don't think I want a new relationship in my life like this.  But I think in this neighborhood, that's how they operate.  Yeah.  It's a lot of knowing each other and visiting each other's houses and things like that.  The builder to the house.  Yesterday I had both doors open because I had furniture moving in. 
[02:35:00]  And before I got down to close them, I hear, Anthony!  And the builder's in my house.  Like, excuse me, I bought it.  You don't need to be here anymore.  You can leave now.  I inadvertently left the door open.  Please leave.  Like, I'm done with knowing people.  I know everyone I want to know.  And now I got neighbors.  Here's how you get rid of the neighbor.  Yeah.  It's very subtle.  You set up on your balcony.  Okay.  You take a telescope and you aim it at the trampoline.  And you just sit there and watch.  And lick your lips. 
[02:35:30]  Who says that hasn't been done already?  You don't do anything.  You just, you watch.  You stand up.  You watch with your hands on your hips.  And you shake your head like, wow.  And you walk in for a couple of minutes.  And then you come back out and watch again.  Big thing sticking out the window so it's obvious.  No, on the balcony you do it.  On the balcony.  You bring it on the balcony and you aim it.  And what you do is.  Make sure the sun's reflection glints off the lens into their eyes.  No, no.  What you do is you do that.  And then you bring over a gift and it's bathing suits for the kids. 
[02:36:00]  A little white bathing suits.  Skimpy bikini shorts.  Nothing creepier than neighbors that take interest in the children.  Yeah.  Oh, is that creepy?  That could work.  Hey, if you go away for a few days, you could always, you know, we don't mind watching them.  Yeah.  You need a babysitter?  Yeah, we got a king bed.  We're good.  We see Midnight Cowboy.  We'll watch him like that.  We'll all drink with a cowboy hat on in bed.  Call him lover.  Send him to the movies for a dollar.  It's like cartoons because I got a lot of anime porn. 
[02:36:30]  A lot of it.  You should just, like, every day at 1130, just run into your house with electronic boxes as fast as you can.  Just, like, just do things to freak out the neighbors.  Just open the hatch and just run boxes into your house as fast as humanly possible.  I got to do something, but I'll keep you posted on how this relationship with my new neighbor is going.  Oh, it's just going to turn out awfully.  Because they initiated it, and now I feel compelled because we're waving to each other now that it's got to continue.  There's going to be the, I know when the weather gets nicer, Opie, there's going to be lawn talk. 
[02:37:00]  Barbecues.  There's going to be, like, the talk that we have when I'm out on my lawn having to do something, and he's on his.  It's going to be, hey, how you doing?  They're going to come over and talk about seed or some kind of fertilizer.  What do you use here?  All that kind of.  Also, the borrowing of the tools.  I don't have tools.  That would be smart.  Call the guy.  He has the tools.  You do have tools.  They're called listeners.  And by the way, the beautiful part is going to be when they start digging that pool. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, the fucking conversations.  You're going to, ah, it looks like you're putting a pool in.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's either that or it's a mass grave.  Yeah, make it look like.  You got any lime?  Yeah, make it look like a mass grave until it's obvious that it's a pool.  Yeah.  Let's go to Ben's raw ass.  Oh, shit.  Ben's raw ass.  Hey, boys.  You know what?  And Anthony's neighbors are probably talking about Anthony like he's a clopex from the  burbs.  This is my brother, the doctor. 
[02:38:00]  Not a very popular movie, but, oh, he goes, oh, fuck.  He knew he blew it.  It might be good if anyone saw that movie.  Yeah, if you saw the movie.  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Hey, a couple things.  One, you know the way Jews work.  They probably already know who you are.  And they just like gossiping, like, you know, who moved in next door.  So they might have an idea of who you are.  And also, you should just embrace the neighbors.  They don't, you know, not, like, be friendly.  Just be friendly.  Don't be like.  I'm very friendly, but I don't want things like, you know, going over there for dinner 
[02:38:30]  type thing.  Because that's how those things progress.  No, they're not really like that.  They progress.  And then if you put them off too many times, then you got a bad friendly relationship.  Because, oh, they put us, oh, well, we're not good enough for them to come over to dinner.  But it's just a big pain in the ass.  How Jewish are these people?  Are they can't turn the lights on in certain parts of the day Jewish?  I'm still figuring that out.  The whole neighborhood's Jewish.  I know because every restaurant I've gone to, the conversations are nothing but tumors,  heart attacks, and dead people. 
[02:39:00]  You sit at a restaurant.  You want to have a good day.  Did I tell you about your aunt?  Your aunt, Meg, she's in the hospital.  She's in the hospital.  She had a clot in her leg.  The doctor, a very good doctor, had tried to have it removed, but it moved the clot.  And now if it, and I'm trying to eat, and it's just nothing but disease talk.  Jewish people in restaurants, when they get together with their whole family, it is all 
[02:39:30]  disease talk.  That's all it goes to.  And it disgusts me.  I'm like, listen to this shit.  God.  All right.  Well, it's part of the, you know, you want security.  You've got to live in those neighborhoods.  I would love to live in a Jewish or gay neighborhood.  Well kept.  Let me tell you.  No problems.  No one's fucking with you.  The streets.  They're doing work next door.  They're doing, they're building another house.  So they're pouring foundation, everything.  The work trucks leave.  Now, you know how when work trucks leave a job site, the dirt that gets picked up in 
[02:40:00]  the treads goes onto the street for a certain amount until it wears off?  They pull out until there's no more dirt and then hose the street down to clear the dirt  off of the goddamn street.  It's, you just don't see that.  It's a wonderful, it's like leave it to beaver neighborhood.  It's a germ-free utopia.  It's a Jewish leave it to beaver neighborhood.  We need Ant's neighborhood music when he talks about this stuff.  It's fantastic.  Yeah.  And I know once the weather gets nicer and people come out, you're going to see the 
[02:40:30]  blossoming trees on the lawn.  Opie, I have trees on my lawn that I don't even know what they are yet.  One looks like a weeping willow.  The other one, I think there's lilac bushes right there.  My lawn, it's a little brown now from the winter, but I know once summer comes it's going  to be a lush green lawn just like the rest of them.  Are you walking around your lawn?  Howdy, neighbor.  Are you walking around your lawn with a pipe?  I want to get a corncob pipe.  Just taking it all in.  And a little fedora.  And just go, hi neighbor! 
[02:41:00]  And have him go, hi back to me as he's putting down some lawn seed.  And I'm mowing the grass.  Like that'll ever happen.  Hey, how's the firm?  Good.  How was it fucking strippers with a plastic bat?  Not bad.  All right, some things will have to be worked out.  Wait till they find out who you are.  I know, I don't know what to do about that.  Then you're going to see people running into their houses every time you're around.  Like my realtor asked that.  She's like, so you know, you work for Satellite Radio. 
[02:41:30]  I'm like, yeah.  She goes, what do you do?  Don't you hate that?  I go, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, what channel is that?  I go, it's 202, the Opie and Anthony show.  You give them that much information?  Well, they ask.  What do I say?  I don't know what channel I'm on.  I don't even go that far.  What do you say?  I go, I'm in marketing.  All right.  That's all I say.  I could do that in line.  I swear to God.  But let me tell you something.  When you're with a realtor, you're building up another relationship.  So they learn about you.  All of a sudden, she starts asking you marketing questions. 
[02:42:00]  What the fuck are you going to say?  I go, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we're marketing.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm marketing up a storm.  That's the most I'll do is I'll say, I'm in marketing.  And you have to write the company workforce.  I'll write XM Satellite Radio.  Like, oh, what do you do for them?  That's pretty exciting.  Wow.  Are you a talk show host or something?  I go, nah, I'm just in marketing.  Marketing?  I'm nobody.  That's exactly what I do.  And it diffuses the situation.  And no one has asked a follow-up question. 
[02:42:30]  What do you do in marketing?  Because it's boring.  Marketing could be anything.  But what do you do?  You build it on lies.  And then all of a sudden, they get the paper.  There you are in the paper.  One day, he's just flipping through the paper.  And there's Opie and Anthony.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  Yeah, but then.  Now, what do you do?  Well, I market my own radio show that's heard by millions.  The lie catches up to you.  That's okay.  I can't lie to the neighbors.  That's all right.  Because they find out, and then you lied. 
[02:43:00]  So what do you say?  I don't know.  Sanitation.  Tell them you're in sanitation.  Waste management.  I'm giving some awful job.  I'm a feces consistency tester in a cancer ward.  Oh, God.  You should get a plumbing company logo made.  And just slap it on the truck before I leave.  Slap it on your truck before you leave every morning.  Good idea.  That would look even worse.  That would look even more mafia.  Oh, yeah.  He's a plumber.  You give an awful, awful job that you do. 
[02:43:30]  Like, what do you do?  I work at the 7-Eleven, and my girlfriend hurt her foot.  What?  Or make-believe, like, you won one of those wacky lawsuits.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, slip and fall.  The coffee was too hot, and it burned your crotch.  Did you hear about the guy at McDonald's that sat on the toilet seat, and it crushed his testicles?  Yes.  That's me.  That's me.  That's me.  Look it up on the internet.  I got $10 million for that.  $10 million, because I can't have kids.  But you have yours, and I'll enjoy them.  Well, you say I'm an author, and I wrote a best-selling book in Europe called The Lies 
[02:44:00]  of the Holocaust.  Want a beer out of my stein?  Well, it's going to be interesting to see how that relationship develops.  Yeah, this whole Anthony in the suburbs thing, it's kind of new to me.  I've always lived there, but I've never been a homeowner, and I've never been in such a suburban-type  neighborhood like this.  This is very foreign for you.  Full of surprises for me.  Yeah.  But I'm very, like, it's very different for me, because I'm kind of, like, doing things 
[02:44:30]  that I never did, because I could give a shit about any place I lived before.  But now that it's mine, I found myself out on my back patio, and I'm sweeping it.  Ugh.  I was sweeping the leaves off of it.  I thought the same thing, but I'm like, I just got to get these leaves off of my patio.  Anthony's going to do the old lady bend over and start pulling weeds out and doing his  stupid gardening.  Fucking house-frault.  No.  No, because I have to do that.  You're going to have the plumber crack.  I have to do it before.  Giving the whole neighborhood an oopsie. 
[02:45:00]  No.  No, this is just until the weather gets nice, and I call the landscaping company, because  they do it all.  They do it all.  But now, because, you know, there's a lot of leaves there, and the landscaping company  wasn't there, a lot of leaves piled up, and I wanted to get them off of my patio.  Is it an acre?  A little under.  Yeah.  It's nice.  It's nice.  I'll invite you over, Jimmy, once I get a few things and meet the neighbors.  Man, I get the pool.  I can't wait to show up.  I just can't wait until he shows up.  Little gangster fag is blaring out my patio window. 
[02:45:30]  Comes out in a Nazi uniform.  Yeah.  Or I'll be the wigger.  You guys will ruin it for me.  Yeah, we certainly will.  I was thinking it would be very funny to just have, like, rap blasting and have Patrice  out on the front balcony.  I'm going to all gangsta it out.  I'm going to show up blasting Ramstein.  Yeah, that'll go over well, though.  Too harsh.  Too harsh, man.  And I'll jump out with, like, a little headband and tight, tight little shorts and a fucking  tube top tied.  My fucking awful gut sticking out.  Bouncing on the neighbor's trampoline. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Without permission.  Jump, jump, jump, jump.  Just clapping at the children as they jump.  And they have a big old sheepdog next door.  Yeah.  Perfect American family edition.  That doesn't smell in the rain.  Fucking big, dirty animal.  All right.  Why don't we say hi to Laszlo?  Laszlo, that's right.  Hi, sweetie.  Wait.  Actually, this is a good story, though.  Hold on a minute.  Brad in Dallas.  Brad.  Brad.  Laszlo, you're going to have to wait a minute.  Brad.  Brad. 
[02:46:30]  I hope you can do justice to the title that is up on your screen.  Your Call with your story.  Go ahead, Brad.  Well, I moved into this neighborhood a couple years ago.  And it's a nice neighborhood.  And me and my wife were doing some yard work.  Well, when they first moved in, we went over and introduced ourselves.  And I was like, you know, the eager to get to know the neighbor guy.  We were talking for a while.  And he wasn't really that open.  He kind of was kind of like you, you know.  And fuck you, get the hell out of my house.  I didn't say that. 
[02:47:00]  So a couple months later, me and my wife.  By the way, I want to go inside the show a little bit here.  Yeah.  Brad is very nervous.  Very nervous, aren't you, Brad?  He's doing the old clear the throat.  How nervous are you, Brad?  Not really that nervous.  No?  Well, you just got a lot of phlegm?  Not so much, no.  It's going good.  All right.  So you're...  I was just smoking a cigar, so...  All right.  You were doing the neighborly thing in this new neighborhood.  You were that guy.  Go ahead.  Right.  So a couple months later, we're in the backyard.  We're doing lawn work.  And I'm mowing the yard. 
[02:47:30]  And as I come to my fence, I look.  We've got a privacy fence.  And I open up the gate.  And I look across.  And there is the neighbor's teenage daughter blowing her boyfriend on the air conditioning unit.  Bravissimo.  Oh, no.  I couldn't fucking believe it.  I couldn't fucking believe it.  I yelled at my wife.  I mean, there's kids, like, outside, you know, running through the water sprinklers.  And there's the strollers and the women walking down the road with their cars.  Right.  Nice suburban scene. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, exactly.  So I call my wife over.  And I go, look at this shit.  And she looks over.  And the dude looks over at us and gives us the fucking heads-up nod.  What's up, man?  I just fucking couldn't believe it.  And, you know, we didn't say anything.  We told the neighbor about it when we were talking the next day.  And, you know, she's like, oh, you're so full of shit.  You know, I don't believe that's going on.  A couple months later, she catches the daughter.  She's outside washing her car.  And the daughter gets out of their, they had a Durango.  She gets out of the Durango and pulls up her pants. 
[02:48:30]  And the kid jumps out behind her.  What a good girl.  So there's obviously something going on.  Dude, you told the neighbor's parents, though?  No, no, no.  We didn't tell the parents.  The kids were homeschooled.  You told the neighbor on the other side, maybe?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, what neighbor did you tell?  We told the neighbor right next door to her.  Oh, okay.  The people that we saw were directly across the street.  Oh, hot, man.  You should have whacked your bag to it.  Did you ever have to talk to the father of the daughter?  Well, we did a few months later because, like, all the cops showed up at their house one day. 
[02:49:00]  Well, we noticed this midget was coming over there pretty frequently.  I'm telling you, dude, this is not the kind of shit that I would have expected when I moved into this neighborhood.  Sounds fantastic.  And this midget used to drive around in a Ford Escape.  And I don't know if he was sitting on a bucket or something, but his fucking huge head was always up in the front of the fucking window.  So it was kind of awkward looking, the way the dude would always drive around.  Well, he was with some kind of youth ministry bullshit. 
[02:49:30]  And when the cops showed up there that day, they were looking for him because apparently the midget had been fucking the daughter, too.  Oh, my God.  Are you serious?  I'm kidding.  That's great.  As far as Christian midget, as far as I'm concerned, every midget should be an atheist.  Yeah.  Right.  What God would do that?  Well, I thought you guys might enjoy that.  Oh, that's a great story.  Thank you, Brad.  All right, buddy.  God's little collection of leftover parts.  All right.  Let's have these little stubby legs.  Pop them on a big head. 
[02:50:00]  Let's say hi to Laszlo.  Fulton in Pennsylvania.  What's up?  He has a question for Laszlo.  I don't know who that girl was.  I thought I was born her boyfriend.  I think it might have been that girl that her boyfriend shot their parents to death.  But I called Laszlo to ask him about the P.I.  Wait.  Hold on, sir.  You can't just move on from that.  Are we on a conference call here?  Nah.  I was nervous, so I had to take the call in the bathroom.  Oh, so you're taking a shit while you call.  Yeah.  Sir.  Good.  You have to take this.  Okay. 
[02:50:30]  All right.  Horrid.  Now continue.  Yeah, let's go.  All right.  I want to talk to Laszlo about the PS3 and what do you think about Sony pushing the date  back to the fall.  And is it going to be worth buying when it comes out?  Right.  Well, I think they're delayed over the whole Blu-ray DVD technology.  I still think they're going to be miles ahead of the Xbox.  The Xbox came out way too soon.  Way too soon.  But they're making money right now. 
[02:51:00]  It's not selling that well in a lot of places.  It didn't do that well in Europe, and it didn't do that well in Japan.  What are they saving up to be Jewish?  What are they saving time to be Blu-ray compatible?  Yeah, basically.  Is that what they're doing?  What's Blu-ray?  Oh, it's the latest in DVD and gaming.  The new DVD format, there's Blu-ray and there's HD.  It's two competing formats for high-capacity discs that you'd be able to put like 25 gig, 
[02:51:30]  25 to 50 gig on a disc.  Oh, they're burnable.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, um, and I actually, when I was at the Seabit convention in Germany last week, I saw  some of the first laptops that have the HD.  Icon.  Chicken.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They are so bugged out about bird flu over there, dude.  Stop fucking chicken.  Exactly.  Damn Nazis.  Well, like a cat in Germany got bird flu from playing with a cat.  A cat got the bird flu.  So now all these krauts are freaking out and taking their cats to the shelters, like getting 
[02:52:00]  rid of their animals.  And the shelters are overrun.  Really?  1943 derogatory term?  Krauts.  What are the japs?  What are the nips doing?  So without hanging with the Jerry's.  So what's up with the laptops and the HD?  Well, the, um, Toshiba's already coming out with laptops that have the high-capacity drives  in them.  Um, Blu-ray's gonna be a little bit longer.  Sony said that that's the competing format and the one that I think's gonna win.  Um.  Why do they gotta do this? 
[02:52:30]  It's like beta and friggin' VHS.  It, it's.  They gotta have two competing formats, so you go out and buy one, and that's the lemon,  and then you gotta buy the other one, because there's nothing available, uh, for the one  you bought.  Yeah, the reason that there's two competing formats is each side wants that format to  win so that they get residuals on the technology.  Right.  But.  You think, uh, Sony's gonna, uh.  I think Sony's gonna end up, end up winning.  I think the Blu-ray's gonna, gonna end up knocking it out.  Uh, it stinks that the, the PS3 is gonna, I mean, the, the, the PlayStation is such an  old technology.  The PS2, it came out like 2000. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Is it that long ago already?  Wow.  It's, it's an old technology.  Uh, but they've been focusing on the PSP, and the PSP's been doing very well.  And supposedly, this, this summer, and later this fall, the PSP's gonna drop dramatically  in price.  Because that's the problem.  It's like a four, five hundred dollar investment.  I love my PSP.  I've been playing it like a madman.  It's traveling so easy.  Have you played head-to-head on a plane yet?  No.  Yeah, that's a blast.  Cousin Ed and I were playing head-to-head, uh, on a plane.  We're playing Grand Theft Auto. 
[02:53:30]  And, uh, he's across the aisle, and I'm yelling, you got the rocket launcher?  Oh, shit.  You got certain games you probably shouldn't play.  You guys can play against each other on a plane like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, the PSP is, uh, wireless, and you can play with other people around the country.  It's amazing.  Jesus.  What about, uh, you got any info on The Godfather?  It's coming out, uh, today, I think.  It is coming out today.  It looks really nice.  Let me see.  It's got a non-linear, sort of, storyline.  Some of the Grand Theft Auto.  Yeah, a little Grand Theft Auto-ish.  I saw a few of the, um, teasers to it, where you walk into a store and kind of try to shake 
[02:54:00]  some guy out of some, uh, some, uh, security money.  And, uh, beat the hell out of him and rip his place apart.  Seems pretty cool.  A lot of baseball, bat action, guns.  You gonna buy it?  Yeah, I'll get it, definitely.  You gotta check that one out.  Gotta check it out.  There's a lot of things on your list to cover here, uh, Laszlo.  That is true.  The mobile phones.  What are we doing with mobile phones these days?  Uh, the thing that really made me laugh when I was at C-BIT was, uh, some of the mobile phone  companies out there are recognizing the fact that technology for old people is a real 
[02:54:30]  stress on us younger people.  We've said this on the show so many times, and I see what we're gonna talk about here,  and it's about time, and I think there's a market for this.  Cause, I mean, like, the computer.  I bought my parents, uh, a computer, and it was like giving them a fuckin' nuclear reactor,  and the phone's ringing every other day, like, oh, the Norton antivirus doesn't work,  and the this, and how I can't print anymore.  It's just like, why did I buy you this?  Yeah.  You know, even, let's start even with something a little easier, like I gave my mom a DVD  player. 
[02:55:00]  DVD player.  She's not a dummy.  She cannot grasp the concept of a DVD player.  Yeah, with the menu and stuff, and going from here to here.  All she wants to do, this is all she wants to do, is take her stupid old movie, throw it  in, and push play.  Right.  And you can't do that, cause it goes to the menu first, and then that's, she just, she  cannot grasp the concept.  And I know I'm not alone here.  No.  There's a market for, uh, with this brand new technology to come up with, uh, you know,  a simple form of, of computers, like you said, DVD players, and we're gonna talk about 
[02:55:30]  mobile phones.  And mobile phones, there's some manufacturers in Europe that are making phones for specific  demographics.  So, you've got, like, the 50 to 60 market, the 60 to 70 market, and then 70 plus.  And each phone has less and less features, as they get older.  And, like, the one for the 70 plus is just like this big red, like, help, I'm dying button.  Oh, button!  Help me!  Yeah, it's just a big red button to the hospital or morgue. 
[02:56:00]  The phone for 90 plus just doesn't even work.  Doesn't even have a battery.  Doesn't even have a battery.  It's a phone with a diaper attached to it.  But, like, you go to Verizon store and buy your parents a phone these days.  Even the simplest, like, base model.  It's got all these menus and the text messages.  Yeah, they can't figure it out.  They can't figure it out.  Can't check their messages.  They can't even check their voicemail.  Nope.  So.  Don't know how to get into it.  Oh, my God.  My dad, when we gave him his cell phone.  Snapping pictures of their eyeballs.  He couldn't grasp the concept of freaking checking his voicemail. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  And you leave messages for them.  Right.  And you're like, I left you a message.  It's like, I don't know how to do it.  Great.  It's not that they don't know.  They just don't want to learn.  They don't even want to learn because they're not dummies, but they just gave up learning  new technology a long time ago.  They get overwhelmed and they're afraid of being overwhelmed by this new, like, it's almost  like once I get into it, I'm going to realize how much I don't know or how much  I've missed.  Oh.  It's like eating one M&M.  You don't even want to know how good it is.  You don't want to know how good it is. 
[02:57:00]  It's just something overwhelming about it.  I'll be able to learn just enough to realize how old I am.  But it's a silly technology simply because most old people who don't know how to use it  will be dead soon.  Anyone else growing up does know how to use it.  Yeah, it's just a matter of time before everybody's, everyone knows what they're doing.  Because, yeah, the old people will be gone.  I have a question for Laszlo after you do this.  Yeah, Mike in New Hampshire.  I'm getting killed by the end of the phones.  There's no way that they're going to try to make DVDs and computers easier for old  people.  There's no market for it.  Pretty soon, all those old people are going to be dead anyway. 
[02:57:30]  So there's no point in doing any work in the R&D area for that.  Thanks, Norton.  Yeah.  I think it would be quite simple to make these DVD players where all of a sudden, like  I said, make it as easy as throwing the DVD in and, you know, push and play.  Or how about this?  Have it work like a VHS player.  You give people over 50 directions and you say, fucking read this.  And they learn to read directions like the rest of us have to.  How about that?  They can operate in motor vehicles.  They can hit play and figure it out. 
[02:58:00]  Motor vehicles?  Has anything changed in the car in the last 30 years?  Well, no, but you know, I'm saying it's like your brain hand coordination.  I mean, you're fucking, you know.  You can't do that after a certain age.  Nah, I know, you sit on the couch and fucking just.  I hit the brake and it was the gas and I drove over 50 people and off a pier.  Right.  We're not talking about parents that are still relatively young.  I'm talking about, you know, parents in their 70s and stuff.  It starts to get a little different for them.  Well, my mother, you know, I consider her very active, you know, very young for her age. 
[02:58:30]  But as far as technology goes.  And really hot, by the way.  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  Did you see her at the Hard Rock Center?  Amazing.  I didn't see her.  Stop it.  Oh, the pictures are up on opnething.com if you want to see for yourself.  Quit it.  Quit it.  Oh, my God.  Quit it.  She knows how to keep her stuff together.  My mommy.  It's amazing.  Stop it.  Why?  She's really sexy.  Stop it.  No.  Sexy and beautiful.  Would you stop it?  And nice.  And has a wonderful voice when she's not drunk.  Would you stop it?  Don't compliment my mother. 
[02:59:00]  Stop it.  That's all you want to hear about your mom.  She's a nice lady.  Right.  A nice lady.  And we love how you call her mommy in front of everybody.  Hi, mommy.  You never want to hear this.  That's your mom?  No.  You never want to hear that.  Ugh.  Well, I didn't hear that a lot on Friday.  It was the worst when Patrice said it.  Especially when she went, that's Patrice.  Shut up.  Hold on.  We want people to get credit on this show.  Sarge from Whack Bag. 
[02:59:30]  Go ahead, Sarge.  Yeah, Anthony had a...  Funny line y'all missed.  I could picture it, too, when he said,  old people can't figure out the technology.  They're taking pictures of their eyeballs.  I didn't hear that.  Thank you, sir.  Some old curmudgeon.  All right, very good.  50 pictures.  Because they don't know how to retrieve the pictures, either.  So when their kid gets it,  they're just scrolling through 50 pictures of eyeballs.  That's really funny.  How do you take it?  I got a question for Lazlo.  I got a phone right now.  It's a Sprint.  It's got a Palm Pilot technology.  And I want to upgrade to one of the newer ones, 
[03:00:00]  but they're all windows.  How do I get all my Palm info off Palm onto Windows?  Why would the same company put out a phone  that you can't transfer your calendar information to?  That's rough.  I know you should be able to move over  all your contacts and phone numbers.  That's what you're mostly concerned about, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can save that as a database file  and then import it into your new phone.  Right.  You'll have to put it onto your computer  and then put it onto your new phone.  How about calendar stuff?  Calendar stuff, I don't know,  because you're looking to go to Outlook now, I suppose. 
[03:00:30]  Hey, someone is saying DS is kicking PSP's ass.  I had DS.  I love...  It's not even close.  No.  I love the PSP over the DS.  And every time I talk about, like,  the Nintendo DS, obviously, right.  PSP on this show,  I get, like, all these nerd fanboys going,  Nintendo rules.  PSP blows away.  I had both, and I...  Honestly, I threw out my DS.  I didn't even want it around the house.  Didn't even want it around the house.  I didn't want it around the house.  I threw it away with all the games it came with. 
[03:01:00]  Why don't you get it to one of the boys?  They don't deserve it.  So E-Roc can raise a virtual puppy.  Most of the guys got PSP's.  That's the one I got.  Anyway, are we done with the phones?  The Vibe phone?  Oh, yeah, they've got ringtones now called Vibe Tones  that, like, vibrate out a specific song  based on who's calling you.  So your phone vibrates differently  for your girlfriend versus your mother.  How the hell are you going to notice that?  I don't know. 
[03:01:30]  Just the pattern and the vibration.  I have panicked when my phone is vibrated.  You have it in your pants pocket  and just kind of forget about it,  and you think you're getting  some kind of nerve damage thing  happening to your leg.  Your ball bag?  Like, you don't know what it is?  It scares the shit out of you  sometimes when it's vibrating.  You ever have a phantom vibrate  when it's not vibrating,  but you think maybe it is?  Yes.  You think it is?  Because you moved a little.  You're like, ah, fine.  Nothing happened.  What is it about phones ringing in your pocket  where you just can't get to home?  You can't get there.  You're going to panic mode. 
[03:02:00]  You freak out.  You're pulling keys out  and you're changing money.  And the phone falls out.  It's never the first pocket you go for.  Never.  What is that about?  You just completely panic  and you always miss the call.  Always just miss.  Boink.  Missed call.  Son of a...  And then you try to call the guy back,  but he's leaving you a message  so you get his voicemail.  First ring and picks up.  Yeah.  Oh, he's calling!  Just panic.  So, phones roll, people.  The camera phones are finally getting better.  Yeah, the 3.1 megapixel.  Sony's got a really nice phone. 
[03:02:30]  They haven't figured out the phones  where you can listen to music yet  because it just sounds like crap, right?  Or is that getting better finally?  The MP3 phones are getting better.  Getting better?  You know, talking about the phone in your pocket,  that Europeans are very worried about cancer.  I actually went to this booth  and they said this guy was telling me that...  Your balls.  Yeah.  I'm basically nuking the boys.  Oh, Jesus.  Because...  Oh, it's kind of laying right there.  Yeah.  They're actually putting special fabrics  in clothing in Europe  that will prevent radiation from hitting your...  We got audio of this? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  This is fantastic.  Let's look at this.  This fabric is to keep radiation out.  Yeah.  We use it in fashion.  Brands from Europe use it inside fashion  and they have jackets and sports jackets  with pockets for mobile phones inside.  So the direct radiation from mobile phones  cannot go to your body.  So why are we worried about mobile phone radiation?  Cancer?  Chomers?  Yeah, maybe.  No one knows 
[03:03:30]  because we only use mobile phones  since five to ten years.  Is there any underwear that you make  so there's no radiation on the little guys?  Yeah, I think at the moment  this product is not so feeling comfort on your skin.  A lot of people in Europe  are wearing fabric that keeps radiation out.  Radiation from electronic machines  and not only mobile phones produce radiation.  I keep my mobile phone in my pocket right here. 
[03:04:00]  You think maybe I could be shooting blanks?  What is shooting blanks?  You think maybe it makes me so I can't have a baby?  Um, yeah, maybe.  Oh, God.  Jews.  That happened.  Maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  We learned by implanting cell phones into Jews testes  that they do go sterile.  If you give me chocolates, you can put more on the list.  Hey, we got a call from Philly.  Let's say hi to Dan. 
[03:04:30]  Hey, Dan, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  I heard you talking about the technology and the parents.  Yeah.  I got the same thing because it's really bad for me  because my dad, my old man, he's a lawyer,  and he's in his mid-60s, and I'm 30 myself,  and the whole idea was for me to kind of go to work with him,  you know, and take over the family law practice,  things like that, but it's just not happening.  And the reason is exactly what you guys were talking about  with the technology.  He's old school, and he dropped out somewhere around, like, 1985 
[03:05:00]  when the fax machine came out, and he doesn't want to learn anything.  This infernal machine, the fax.  It happens to the best of us.  You just hope that you could, you know, get a lot older  before you finally give up on all this.  Like we were talking earlier, people give up on discovering new music,  you know, and things like that.  Yeah, but technology is something like it's different than music.  But people do give up on technology eventually, too.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[03:05:30]  But it's so, it's handy.  It makes things more convenient and easier for the people using them.  But the difference is, people, like, for thousands of years,  technology now reinvents itself so quickly.  It's like, years ago, you had, like, you know what,  you have a fucking, an iron hammer for four centuries.  That was the new thing.  I don't want to use that.  But after the Industrial Revolution, everything, like,  it's like a big ball that's rolling, but it's getting tighter and tighter,  the cycles.  So people, everything is, like, flipping over and, like, fuck. 
[03:06:00]  Whereas normally, how many, I mean, 80 years ago,  you probably had to learn a few things when you were old,  and that was it.  Yeah, true.  What else we got?  How to call the police when you saw an interracial couple.  What else we got?  You call the police, you take care of it on your own terms.  That's true.  A citizen's hanging.  I was telling Anthony on that same CD, there was a,  I actually spoke with the German military when I was over there.  They're testing out remote control helicopters.  Of course they are.  Of course.  Sure.  What are they doing with these things? 
[03:06:30]  Um, well, as the gentleman told me,  they're using them for surveillance.  They're looking at the people with the last names at the end of it,  Shteen.  You're going to have one hovering over your neighborhood in no time.  I got a couple.  They're great.  You want helicopters?  Yeah.  You want helicopters?  But, yeah, they're like these four-blade helicopters,  and they can maneuver them down halls or whisper quiet. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Want to hear the clip?  Yeah.  For reconnaissance in urban areas.  Like what kind of areas?  Cities, villages, buildings.  Look into windows.  It's new.  It's brand new.  So, what kind of people will you be surveilling?  What kind of people we want to survey?  Yeah.  What kind of people do you want to do surveillance?  Jews?  I don't have a permission to answer this question. 
[03:07:30]  Okay.  You think you can make it maybe drop coins or?  Coins, you know, drop money.  No.  Oh, the Jews love the coins.  Make them run into one place.  You can take care of them all at once.  Oh, so?  Yeah.  No.  We don't have money for this.  Holy shit.  Who the hell was that?  I was just having a nice conversation with members of the German military. 
[03:08:00]  More furniture, Anthony?  Is your phone ringing it?  Uh.  Oh, jeez.  Is your phone ringing?  Yeah.  It's the Anti-Defamation League.  Yeah, apparently, um, I think there's, uh, somebody in the house doing some work that  perhaps might have heard some stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  That's the way it goes.  Whoever's fixing that house right now, tough shit. 
[03:08:30]  Don't fucking scratch my fucking floors, motherfucker.  He's talking about you.  That's not me.  Just fix it, you shit dick.  Turn the radio off.  Turn the radio off.  Turn the radio off.  I'm going to catch you in now.  Just fix my shit and get out.  Turn the radio off.  I don't need scratched floors.  I dare you to scuff my floors, pussy boy.  That's Jim Norton.  I dare you.  I'll give you his address, scratch his floors.  It's already got rocks on there.  You can just rub them on his floor.  I don't have the rocks anymore. 
[03:09:00]  What happened to your rocks?  What happened to the rocks?  I'll tell you.  Not fashionable anymore?  They're in a bag.  You throw them at people's heads.  No, I have other rocks.  I have a bunch of pictures that I have to hang up.  Because I have the new furniture I'm going to get a little bit here and there.  I haven't hung pictures yet.  So my rocks are now propping my pictures up against the wall so they don't slide.  As I picked up my brand new Ozzy Richard Pryor photos yesterday, I'm in love with them.  Oh, very good.  Congrats.  All right, Lazlo.  What else you got there?  You know, they've got this 103-inch plasma TV that you saw at the Consumer Electronics  Show.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a crowd of like 200 people around this thing. 
[03:09:30]  And this guy was giving a huge, rousing speech.  And I was standing in back with my TV be gone.  Yeah.  Turned it off mid-presentation.  Did you?  Oh, dude, it was hysterical.  It was hysterical.  TV be gone really works, huh?  Oh, yeah, it does.  There's a European version now.  Yes, because there's different codes for crowd TVs.  Where can I get...  Jube gone.  Jube gone.  And he just stands at the window at home. 
[03:10:00]  Wait, where can I get these, like, cell phone be gone?  Where can I get this stuff?  Mobile phone jammers are illegal in the United States.  Yeah, they're illegal.  But we were testing one out over there, a new one.  How does it work?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah.  I love mobile phone jammers.  How big is it?  It's about the size of a deck of cards.  They're looking to put some in movie theaters now, which I am absolutely for.  Yep.  Nothing worse than sitting in that movie theater and having a cell phone ring and hearing  a conversation from some person that also paid to see the movie. 
[03:10:30]  Right.  They sure did.  Dead presidents they paid.  Right.  All right.  Derek's saying we have to take a break.  Are you done with that one there?  Yeah, man.  All right.  We'll continue with Laszlo in just a bit.  He also brought in the review of the Sirius S50 portable unit.  That's a dangerous one.  S is short for shit, by the way.  Just in case people think that you guys are biased, this is a review. 
[03:11:00]  An actual review that we'll get into.  An actual review where they pan it worse than.  All right.  We'll get into that next.  All right.  We're running out of show.  We got Laszlo in studio.  He's going to be doing a show on 202 on April 8th, I believe, right?  Yeah, man.  Couldn't do a few hours for us.  What day of the week is that?  Saturday.  Probably a Saturday night.  We're starting to, you know, do some things on the weekend. 
[03:11:30]  And actually, you got a promo for your show you made?  Yeah.  Take a listen to this really fast here.  And we're still trying to figure out what the pest could do.  We want to give the pest a couple hours on the channel.  Yeah.  Maybe they should start sending in their ideas to who?  Steve at foundrymusic.com.  Steve.  If you have an idea for a show and you're a pest, we want to hear your ideas.  And we'll read all the ideas on the show and we'll give out a few hours to a pest out there.  Okay?  Add a little appreciation. 
[03:12:00]  A modern bear-type gay photo to the suggestion.  Steve likes a suggestion with a cock picture inside.  And the subject heading should be open, this faggot.  Oh, shit.  He's going to kill you one day.  You know that.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying that.  Oh, no.  Here he comes.  Oh, no.  He's coming in.  Is this the time he finally snaps your neck?  I don't know.  But I wasn't knocking Steve.  You can only hope.  No.  No, that wasn't a knock on Steve.  No.  Steve, give him a bear hug.  I didn't even hear the whole thing, but I'm assuming I got called queer for the eighth 
[03:12:30]  billionth time.  No, I didn't actually.  He's the most manly man.  And you're calling him a man.  I'm a man's man.  He is a man's man.  Let's see how long it takes him to get a heart on it.  Go ahead.  Look.  Oh, man's back up.  The guy, we all go to take a leak before, and again, Jimmy is just standing at the urinal  chatting with his pants down to his ankles.  It's not even like he pulls it down so just a little bit of his butt shows.  He drops his pants like a kid would in front of his potty.  He just drops it and stands there with his ass hanging out. 
[03:13:00]  He's a man.  Man, look at him.  Exactly.  Such a man.  What kind of man?  He's a real man.  Wait for it.  A what?  A what?  A real man's man.  That's right.  Exactly.  He's a man. 
[03:13:30]  Such a man.  He's a real man.  He's a real man's man.  He stinks, and I don't like him. 
[03:14:00]  Appropriate.  Alright.  You're all man, Steve.  I do try.  Look how svelte.  Look how svelte.  Thank you.  It's amazing.  He is.  Steve is starting a V.  I know.  Getting there.  A little V action.  Getting there.  All right, here's the Laszlo promo.  Thank you, Steve.  What did you want to say?  No, what I was going to say is I don't mind listening to Pest show ideas.  If it's over three minutes long, it's getting...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We don't even want that.  Oh, really?  Simple email.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:14:30]  Simple email to steve at foundyourmusic.com, your idea for a radio show.  Oh, okay.  That's it.  So it can be really quick and easy to go through.  And you bring some of the more interesting ideas we'll talk about on the show, and we'll  give out a few hours to a pest out there.  Early prediction?  None.  How do you say no, no, no, no, no, no so fast?  What?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Did I just do it then?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You know, I keep forgetting that's actually Steve.  I thought that was a sound clip from something else.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  How do you do that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  If I did, I would actually have to try to contradict you.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:15:00]  See, I can't even do it now.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
[03:15:30]  board in a boom box and i was back spinning for one night only i've laid a couple of chicks out  on the expressway i have one i didn't leave them but we had a walk if you did wheelies going to  the midtown tunnel you know it was like the only thing you focused on was the fact that your  headlight was on the top of the tunnel the laszlo show this ain't little house on the prairie  starring big wayne you bang a homeless girl yeah she lives in a car she wasn't homeless  read tucker i blacked out for like the last five minutes i don't even know what 
[03:16:00]  is this a radio show still and laszlo and as we all know when it's time to negotiate with an art  dealer it's time to whip out your junk i'm a controlled recreational drug user two ounces  a week that's reasonable the laszlo show saturday april 8th from 8 to 11 eastern on xm 202  hey right on i love how important it is  without music behind it like shit i can't miss this exactly exactly all right we're running out of 
[03:16:30]  show and we got a few more things to go through here from uh the technophile with laszlo you know  steve's hybrid they're they're actually talking about maybe adding uh sounds to the to the hybrids  because they're too quiet yeah there's some pedestrians groups they're a little concerned  that uh you know people like steve are going to be going to have an idea  how about this why don't fucking pedestrians pay attention 
[03:17:00]  well they've got their ipods on because they're hitting people is that a problem hybrid cars too  quiet yeah and they want to what make artificial sounds yeah maybe uh vroom  do a voiceover guy vroom vroom don't we want to quiet down our neighborhoods it's it's unbelievable  they made sounds but it was the sounds of birds chirping so they stroll out into the road 
[03:17:30]  fucking asshole pedestrian groups sounds of a quiet roadway well how about the sounds of a guy in a  wheelchair so it kind of reminds you to fucking watch where you're going shit dicks hate  pedestrian groups we're a group of people without vehicles there's a pedestrian groups you know you're  called assholes by everyone in a car and what's uh what's this thing about ticket cameras for loud  cars oh yeah there's uh they're testing out you know they've got the cameras that will if they 
[03:18:00]  detect you going too fast they'll take a picture and uh you just get a ticket in the mail you don't  don't even know that you how did that law get passed when we're all sleeping at night  yeah i'll tell you one of those things red lights same thing you go through red light they take a  picture you go through toll booth without paying they take a picture and you got to pay the fine  there's no points no points but they can't like prove you drove you drove one of the reasons that  they've been adopted so quickly nationwide is the manufacturers of them go to cities and say  we will install these for free and split the revenue with you ah see money so just in dc alone 
[03:18:30]  they've uh they've billed drivers 171 million since they installed them wow i don't have any  problem with them though to be honest with you i mean if you're running a red light you're gonna  fucking i don't want to get plowed into let's big brother watch us you know i'm not for running red  lights but i'll i'll cut that yellow real close and there are times you could easily go through a  red and no one's gonna care you can't notice but how they're only at major intersections and how  often do you but see yeah i've got like you're missing the point they're not doing it for safety 
[03:19:00]  they're doing it to collect more money from us but i know that's what pisses me off  i don't care that they come up with these things just to collect more of our money i'll tell you  why because i drive and i slow down when i know that there's certain lights that have it i won't  run the light and the bottom line is i don't want to get fucking paralyzed you don't know where they  are most of the times you don't know where a cop is sitting either larry law biting i don't mind  that no i'm serious shit like that like i don't it's not catching you doing anything right and  making you wrong all right so red lights so you don't mind they do that so when they come out 
[03:19:30]  uh with the whole system where they they can figure out how fast you've been going between toll booths  now what uh do you mind about that of course i wouldn't like it but technically all right but  maybe right but that's gonna be the next step you can't give them you can't give them anything  ever they already can do that but anthony i'm telling you anthony was onto something a long time  ago with this shit well you give him an inch you can't give him an inch you are because you don't mind  about that well great then they they install the old you know uh figure out the math between uh toll 
[03:20:00]  stops they already have that and then mail the ticket to you no they're not sending tickets  they're not but they can they can figure out they already have the technology and you don't mind  that or do you mind that it is what it is i don't have to like it it's a reality and it's not illegal  big brother is an expression people use but it's like we've always had big brother i mean the cops are  big brother if you run a red light and the cop is there you're busted so i'd rather have a cop doing  that we're fucking catching criminals you know what you should always mind is my point because  they're just going to keep uh adding more and more shit yeah they're putting decibel meters on some of 
[03:20:30]  these now so that if you maybe honk your horn too much or your stereo is too loud or you know people  have these exhaust systems where they have like a honda civic and have an exhaust system to make it sound  like it's a formula one car i hate those yeah good no one makes no one could that make that funny not  only they give you a ticket but they announce what song you're cranking up i guess the carpenters  i'll talk that for you  embarrassing you're loud and a faggot  so you get to this review of the two points for being a faggot of the serious unit yeah the review on 
[03:21:00]  the serious s50 wow this got a ticket for a weight class violation well uh scoliosis to begin with  xm has the enos and the helixes and there's a isn't there a third one that's coming out  when are they coming out do you know uh laszlo no i don't the elo supposedly a wig supposedly this  is not a wig no it's not a wig supposedly sometime sometime this month i guess we were told late  march the new uh portable units were coming out we got a little uh preview of it i mean i'll have our 
[03:21:30]  own uh it's unbelievable light and small these things are they're light they're small they're  like the size of a a very small cell phone the sound is unbelievable on them got the antenna you  are getting live satellite broadcast from xm any of the channels you want to listen to boom you pop  it on you can record it i walk around uh midtown with the big buildings and stuff and never lose  the signal you don't lose the signal it's live broadcast and you have the capability of recording  and you can download mp3s from uh your computer it's all in one this piece of shit that they are 
[03:22:00]  trying to pawn off as a competing unit by deception is pretty much what they're doing they want their  customers to believe this is a portable unit they want people to believe they are trying to hide the  fact in some of their advertising that you cannot get live programming from this uh s50  you have to dock it and download programming we've got the technology yeah yeah yeah we got it uh 
[03:22:30]  it just um it's not good enough yet they don't want to be uh like the other xm losing signals  they figured it out idiot no our units speak for themselves everyone's very happy with them  yep we don't have to bullshit anybody this thing is ridiculous you pave roads with these it's getting  a horrendous review it's like cobbled look how big it is i know it's a brick looking item big thick the 
[03:23:00]  things twice as thick as the uh xm and if you want to record shows you have to have it in the dock and  your car on or it's it's so hard to even understand what you need to do for talk serious promises the  ability to record up to 50 hours of broadcast content but in reality the the options are severely  limited when listening to an individual music station you can save individual songs with the love button 
[03:23:30]  oh uh it's on your machine on your love button  uh for talk radio the options seem better but are really much worse while driving the unit can grab  one hour chunks by programming to record ahead of time it's possible to circumvent the one hour limit  but the unit must be docked and if in the car powered on to record on schedule so here's what this  portable unit needs a buick it's it's portable in a motor vehicle holy shit 
[03:24:00]  in other words you can record what you're listening to while driving or listening to a cd while grabbing  a show or listen to a cd while you're grabbing a show assuming the commute is long enough to get the  whole program as soon as you turn up the car you fuck up you're done process oh my god what a what a hunk  of crap they gave it two out of five stars and i think they were being kind as far as giving it two 
[03:24:30]  stars it looks like what else can you say about this uh piece of shit there laszlo it's overpriced  i mean you can get a handheld unit from xm for like what 150 dollars now yeah this thing is 329  dollars you can get a handheld unit that you can actually walk around in the street and listen to  live programming yeah and here it is unless you purchase the home kit for 99 bucks or the new s50  executive jerry the executive for 249 dollars the s50 uh receiver uh received satellite radio only  when connected to the dock which must be powered by your car it's a and right in the review it says 
[03:25:00]  so why is it such a dud and they explain they explain it further it's just a piece of shit obviously  this by the way this is their top of the line technology this is the competition don't don't  be confused with the fine products coming out uh from xm satellite radio we got the new units  they're going to be on the market in the near future when do they come out in stores i'm going  to get online that's like i said i thought let you know supposedly uh later this month which is well  this month is coming to a close so within the next few weeks i'm assuming yeah or jimmy 
[03:25:30]  fucking cares you sick of this um you it's just annoying it is  laszlo cute as you fuck him thanks again laszlo sure man laszlo will be doing his own show april 8th  on this fine channel from 8 to 11 p.m okay and i guess that's it we'll see you guys tomorrow  see you tomorrow thank you  that's it party is over everybody go home  speak the beat in the show </pre>
