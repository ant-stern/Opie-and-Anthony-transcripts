<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  The show began with Anthony Cumia recounting his “Supercar Weekend,” involving high-speed driving in a Ferrari and Lamborghini, resulting in multiple police stops, one of which involved an officer who happened to be his mother's neighbor.  He also discussed his gun ownership and range trips. Big A was in studio during this segment.

Opie then addressed a New York Post retraction concerning a false story alleging his fiancée’s involvement in a sex tape with Bam Margera.  This led to a discussion about a home invasion where a naked man molested a woman, sparking a debate about personal responsibility and safety.  Further conversation revolved around Anthony’s personal assistant, Keith, whose obsessive tidiness and fabricated stories about Anthony to their neighbors provided numerous humorous anecdotes.  Listener calls questioned the unusual closeness between Anthony and Keith.

The show then touched upon upcoming events: their PNC Arts Center show, Reverend Al Sharpton's protest, and a “Cinco de Mayo Minute” mocking Felix Millán.  They also discussed a Philadelphia police shooting involving a .44 Magnum, $38,000 in cash, and the suspect's escape from a halfway house, prompting a gun control debate and criticisms of Obama and Hillary Clinton's stances on the Second Amendment.  A caller requested the return of the “TNA with ONA” segment, reminding the hosts of its near-firing consequences.  They also planned future live shows in Buffalo and Boston, and expressed violent outrage at Uma Thurman's stalker.  Another caller offered information about Cinco de Mayo, resulting in crude mayonnaise jokes. Opie reiterated the New York Post retraction and his intention to sue.

Opie then recounted entertaining 35 women at his apartment before a *Wicked* show, followed by humorous anecdotes.  The Kentucky Derby was discussed, contrasting Obama's successful bet with Hillary Clinton's horse's fatal injury.  This sparked a lengthy, darkly humorous discussion about euthanizing racehorses, eliciting mixed reactions from callers, including a heated exchange with Lisa from Long Island who ultimately hung up.  The hosts then described their explicit naked billboards. More callers weighed in on the horse euthanasia, and the show concluded with a Steve-themed animation project by Drew Boogie, including a raw audio recording of Steve’s vocal warm-ups and Drew's remix, along with another “Cinco de Mayo Minute” mocking Mexican immigrants.

The next segment started with Opie discussing his book idea, "The Fun of Slapping a Horse Face," and a humorous bit about slapping horses.  A caller, Amanda, questioned their jobs, prompting a cynical discussion about making fun of the “weak” and “underprivileged.”  The Helen Keller birthplace billboard controversy followed, with disparaging jokes about Keller's disability.  Daryl, calling from a SWAT conference, offered to have someone tased on-air.  Opie again addressed the New York Post retraction, expressing frustration and thanking listeners for support.  The show continued with discussions about an animation festival, Drew Boogie's remixes, their comedy tour, Jimmy distributing his mother's shirts, and a list of “sexiest film duos,” leading to a satirical discussion about sex in movies, using *Nine 1/2 Weeks* as an example.  An update on Bob Kelly's relic-hunting trip to Guatemala, followed by audio and discussion of Sam's prank proposal to Jess on the Ron and Fez Show, including Jess's appearance on the show, concluded this segment. Drew Boogie and Dove Davidoff were in-studio guests.

Another segment opened with a failed autograph attempt story involving Bridget Nielsen and Billy Graham.  This led to discussions about Sam's picky eating habits, Jess, and speculation about her dating prospects after a breakup.  Dave Davidoff, promoting his CD "The Point Is," joined the increasingly vulgar and tangential conversations.  Topics included Davidoff's living situation, disdain for Hollywood, his music, criticism of Lindsay Lohan and the President's Iraq statements, a military recruitment commercial, an award for a listener nicknamed “Donkey Sausage,” a call for a listener to defecate on a plate, a highly offensive YouTube video of a hat removal incident, Bob Kelly's Guatemala trip, and a PBS documentary about a man converting poetry to songs.  Offensive and vulgar language was prevalent throughout.

Finally, the show featured Anthony discussing his recent breakup, citing his work schedule and an incident in Atlantic City with an attractive waitress as contributing factors.  He detailed the emotional aftermath, including shredding mementos and contrasting loneliness with newfound freedom.  A lengthy anecdote about a comedian named Nataman and an awkward sexual encounter followed, along with a discussion on gun ownership.  Comedian Duff (David Off) was a guest.  A significant portion was dedicated to selecting the “line of the day,” featuring jokes about Cinco de Mayo, a horse shooting, and other off-color humor.  The show concluded with promotion of Duff’s CD and website.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  We got Big A in studio. He's got the tongue scraper.  He just scraped down an oyster.  We rocked, get in there for a sip of that sample.  Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you shut up?  Shut up! Shut up! Shut the f*** up! 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  Can you reenact baby diaper mustache and tippy-toe's underpants?  Sure. Oh, no, you wouldn't.  It's like the underpants were dyed brown.  All right, open them up.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Hi.  Buenos dias.  Oh, look at you.  Getting into the whole Cinco de Mayo.  Cinco de Mayo, right.  This isn't the Opie and Anthony show.  Today it's Gregorio Antonio.  And you who?  And you are?  You who?  What? I'm just reading this great thing. 
[00:02:00]  No, but...  You just wrecked the hole open.  All right, take two.  Okay.  It's Cinco de Mayo.  Cinco de Mayo.  I'm Gregorio Antonio.  Antonio.  Hey.  I knew he got to be quiet for too long.  Yes.  I was like, what is he doing?  I thought this just caught my eye.  It's good.  Oh, the retraction in, yes, the New York Post.  It's a good one, too.  I want to thank the New York Post for doing the right thing.  And finally admitting that they got horrible, awful information from Chauncey Hayden. 
[00:02:30]  From somebody who tends to give horrible, awful information.  And my fiancee was not in a sex tape like I was trying to tell people.  Off and on for the last year and a half, by the way.  But especially in the recent week and a half, I had to tell a lot of people.  And the Post is admitting they got really, really bad info.  No sex tape.  And my fiancee, matter of fact, never even met Van Margera. 
[00:03:00]  So I want to thank the New York Post for realizing that it was a bunch of ass.  Bunch of ass.  That's vindication.  It's in page six, too, of the New York Post if you want to read it for yourself.  Anyway, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  I ran into Anthony during his Supercar Weekend.  Supercar Weekend.  Jimmy, you weren't here on Friday because you were doing your comedy thing in Pittsburgh.  I heard it went very, very well. 
[00:03:30]  Anthony admitted on Friday that he was doing Supercar Weekend.  You want to explain to Jimmy what Supercar Weekend was about?  Just to kind of, you know, get them up to speed there.  Supercar Weekend.  Go to the Car Club here in New York City.  Manhattan Classic Car Club.  And get a couple of cars.  Ferrari.  And a Lamborghini.  Oh, who had the Toyota Corolla?  Oh, I don't know.  Who took that out?  It wasn't available. 
[00:04:00]  Imagine you go, I'll take the Toyota Corolla.  Do you have a Corolla in here that I could use?  Maybe you got it souped up a little bit for me.  Guys in the Car Club, call me the cruiser.  The cruiser.  Should have called him a dork.  So, yeah, it was a Ferrari and a Lamborghini.  And, of course, one of my close friends had the Lamborghini.  And I had the Ferrari.  And Supercar Weekend, we decided we're going to drive out east, say hello to Mom and Sal out there. 
[00:04:30]  Because they're way out, like exit 63 on the expressway, pretty far from my house, which is, you know, Nassau County.  But we'd get there pretty quick in these cars.  So, the first pullover was getting on the on-ramp to the expressway.  Wait, you were speeding on the on-ramp?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Well, see.  That's almost impossible to do.  We kind of lined up.  And as fate had it, nobody was in front of us.  So, it was two lanes, the red light.  So, we're next to each other.  A Ferrari and a Lamborghini.  It's a good time to see, what's the fastest car?  What's the faster car of the two?  So, my friend had the car in neutral.  Poor him.  I did not.  So, I took off like a shot and hit the on-ramp at, I think it was 105. 
[00:05:30]  You were...  About 105 on the on-ramp.  And apparently, I passed a law officer who was waiting on the on-ramp, but I did not even  see him because I was kind of looking ahead, you know?  Well, that's what you got to do when you're, you know, just starting out at 105.  Yeah.  You're not topping out at 105 knowing you.  So, no, once I got on the expressway, the speed did go up a bit. 
[00:06:00]  I need more info.  How many guns were in the car?  I mean, you're a legal gun owner.  Well, I might have been going to the range.  All right.  So, Calverton's out that way.  So, I don't know, it might have been, you know, a night of, or a weekend of sports cars  and shooting and booze.  Well, that's what you do on Supercar Weekend.  I called it, it was like James Bond.  Yeah.  I was like James Bond only getting pulled over every two seconds.  How come James Bond never gets pulled over?  What happens? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  So, it's Supercar Weekend.  Yeah.  And 105 on the on-ramp, hit the expressway and take off like a shot.  But, meanwhile, Keith is like left behind.  Okay.  I'll get rid of that.  Are you insane?  Well, it happens.  Yeah.  Like a little slip of the tongue.  All right.  So, yeah.  Your friend was behind you.  My buddy's left behind in the dust.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it took about, I guess, eight minutes or so for the officer to catch the car. 
[00:07:00]  Because I passed him so quickly.  He wasn't going to, you know, he's in some Crown Vic or something, you know.  So, I was going down the expressway and it was pretty devoid of vehicles.  Now, there were a few.  I had to kind of, you know, ease around the right.  You go up a little ways.  You find an opening.  You tear ass.  So, it took him a while to even catch me.  But, oh, when I hit some traffic, oh, oh, I just looked in the rear view and just saw 
[00:07:30]  lights and right up on me.  And dust as he's going up the side.  Oh, yeah.  It was just, he was really after me.  Yeah.  And so, I pull over.  Of course, I'm not going to try to run him.  And my buddy pulls up behind him and he comes up to my window.  And he says, what the hell do you think you're doing?  And the only response I had was, driving, sir. 
[00:08:00]  There's no way in hell to make an excuse for this.  There's no, you can't face the officer and say, I was doing that because of this.  How about I was leaving you in the dust, stupid?  That wouldn't be wise, Jimmy.  So, he goes, driving, because you're driving like a, and then he uses the a-hole word.  And I said, yes, sir. 
[00:08:30]  Yes, I was.  I understand.  I apologize.  It's, you know, it's a, it's a Ferrari.  It's, you know, you kind of want to open it up a little bit.  See what it could do, right?  Yeah.  I go, but I have no excuse.  So, he says, he goes, you were at some bar the other night drinking with my brother.  I go, really?  He goes, yeah, you used to be on a paintball team with him.  And he had a few beers with him the other night.  He goes, oh, yeah, that's your brother? 
[00:09:00]  He goes, yeah.  Like you care.  He goes, yeah.  But at that moment, you really did care.  I'm like, okay, maybe this might be an in.  This is, this is working out pretty good so far.  This could work.  Right.  This could work.  He goes, slow it down.  He goes, and buy me a beer.  If I see you over there.  I was like, you got it, sir.  Thank you very much.  I'll buy all your beers.  Yes.  So, got away from that one.  See, Jimmy, there was more than one. 
[00:09:30]  Then Super Call Weekend.  Yeah, that's why he said I got away with that one.  Then Super Call Weekend continues.  Yeah.  When we get into Suffolk County and are, again, tearing down the road now.  And doing the same shenanigans.  And now, we found a portion of the road where two lanes were open.  So, we decide, all right, now let's, once again, Ferrari versus Lamborghini.  Let's just go for it.  So, we did. 
[00:10:00]  Obviously, learning your lesson that happened a few miles back.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, well, we're tooling down the expressway.  I won't even say the speed.  Can I write down the speed?  Because I'm not quite sure what it was because I didn't want to look away from the road.  Can I guess the speed?  You can guess.  All right.  Because I was guessing.  I won't show any Palatau cameras.  I'm just going to put it like.  You can say it because I'm not sure.  Was it over 70?  It's all.  We probably topped out at 72.  Here's my guess. 
[00:10:30]  Faster.  What?  Yeah.  See what I'm holding up?  Dude, this is.  It was faster than that.  All right, hold on.  It was.  I'm going to go.  Do you have a suit on, too?  Yes, I was wearing a tuxedo.  All right, hold on.  There's no way it was more than this.  Yeah, there you go.  It was this?  Yeah, it was that.  That, Jimmy.  It was that.  And we blow past.  And I look.  And there is a cop right on behind those. 
[00:11:00]  You know those big wooden barriers they got to cut down on the sound?  Yeah.  He's sticking out from there.  And I look and see it out of the corner of my eye and go, oh, crap.  Done.  So he comes tearing out.  We have to slow down.  And again, we're on the side of the road where I know everyone we passed at that ridiculous  speed is now passing us laughing their asses off.  Say good.  Giving you the finger.  Good for you.  Pointing at you. 
[00:11:30]  Good for you.  See, honey?  That's why the Prius is so much better.  You'll never see me pulled over like that.  Yeah, so again, we're pulled over, side of the road, comes up to the window.  And for some reason, they always like to ask that, what the hell do you think you're doing  thing.  Wait, did they pull you over or your friend?  Both.  As a matter of fact, I was winning the race, so I was a lot further ahead. 
[00:12:00]  So he pulled over my friend first.  And I kind of stopped way up.  And then I, for a few seconds, I'm thinking, I could just leave and ditch him right here.  And he's not coming after me.  He's sticking with the Lamborghini.  But I stopped.  And I guess the officer waved my friend up to pull up behind me and have him follow the  cop car up.  So now we're, you know, it's me, the cop, and then the Lamborghini. 
[00:12:30]  And he gets out, asks what the hell I'm doing, tells me I'm driving, you know, I see you.  He goes, I don't even know.  He goes, I don't even know how fast you were going.  And I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry, sir.  Again, I'm apologetic.  He goes, where are you going?  I go, well, I'm going to see my mother.  Please tell me, you said, I'm going to see my mommy.  I said, I'm going to see my mommy.  Anthony does say mommy still, even though he's pushing whatever he's pushing. 
[00:13:00]  I'm going to see my mommy.  Anthony's 44, and he still calls his mom mommy.  What excuse is there to be going that fast?  I'm going to see my mother.  She'll be dead in three minutes.  Yeah.  She better really have something very terminal.  So, yeah, I said, I'm going to see my mother.  He goes, oh, where does she live?  So I kind of give the town.  He goes, no, no, where?  And I give the exact address.  And he goes, oh, yeah, Rosemary, Sal's wife. 
[00:13:30]  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, I live like five houses away from them.  I've been to their parties.  I've seen you there.  I'm like, oh.  He goes, and I'm going to call him and tell him you're driving like a crap head,  to use the other word.  Sure.  And I said, well, I'm on my way there now.  I'm sure I'll tell them.  And he goes, all right, well, slow it down.  I said, thank you, sir. 
[00:14:00]  And he went back.  Have a nice day, sir.  Talked to the Lamborghini for a little while.  Yeah.  And then we took off and did the speed limit,  because I was very close to my mother's exit at that point,  and got there and just started discussing how perhaps we ought to slow it down on the drive  home, because I don't think three times is a charm.  We did until we hit the Nassau border.  And then we took off again, because we were getting passed by minivans,  and it was very embarrassing. 
[00:14:30]  And we were going very fast, and then we came up on traffic, so we had to slow down.  And the second we slowed down, we looked, and there was a Nassau cop on the side of the road.  So we were like, oh, jeez.  Wow.  That was close.  Almost the trifecta.  But got out of it.  No tickets?  Not one ticket on Supercar Weekend.  Safe to say going over 100.  Going well over 100.  Well over 100, and it was a fun Supercar Weekend. 
[00:15:00]  Like I said, James Bond just shooting and driving fast and boos and broads.  Oh, just bang, bang, bang, bang.  I should have been in a tuxedo.  Yeah, you went to the range, too?  Yeah.  Wow.  Fired off some shots.  I got a little something I got to play for you.  It's really quick here.  No foot on the brake, and two on the gas. 
[00:15:30]  Hey!  Ooh.  Ooh.  And there's no one driving that Ant-Cast pass, no.  I like this.  Well, he drives too fast on the L-I-E.  His hot red and white Ford Shelby GT500.  She'll horn it.  Yeah.  He might speed it up to 125.  Agent Bob even thinks he won't stay alive. 
[00:16:00]  Meadowbrook Parkway, glass of wine.  And here come 105.  105.  That's a joke.  105.  That's a joke, 105.  And the final part of Supercar Weekend was the fact that I had to drive the Ferrari into  the city this morning.  Yeah.  I think I left at probably a quarter to five. 
[00:16:30]  I was here at five.  Oh, my God.  It was because there's no one on the road.  Yeah.  No one on the road at that hour.  And the entire trip was over 100 miles an hour until I got to the Midtown Tunnel.  Then I was nice.  And there was a couple of the brothers hanging out because I had to pay because I don't have  my E-ZPass in there.  And he's like, damn!  Damn!  Look at that!  Oh, man!  And that thing sounds terrific in the tunnel. 
[00:17:00]  Holy mother of God!  Bop!  Yeah.  So, what car goes faster?  The Ferrari beats the crap out of the Lamborghini.  Really?  In every case.  Off the line.  At a running start.  It's a huge 12-cylinder monster.  So...  My carbon footprint was very big this weekend.  Yeah, I don't...  Very big carbon footprint.  I don't know what you want to admit, but how fast...  I'll just ask.  How fast did you get it up to? 
[00:17:30]  Fastest over the entire weekend was 180 miles an hour.  And I backed off.  That thing will do two bills without a problem.  At 180, were you scared S-less?  Yeah, it gets a little scary.  At 150, it's scary.  And then we could crank it up a little more.  You don't stay there for long.  You just kind of get up to that point and then back off.  I'm the biggest winner because when they gave us Lex's back in the day, 
[00:18:00]  I got it up to 105 going out east and I was scared.  I'm not even going to play and make believe here.  A hundred is now what I feel the speed limit should be, by the way.  A hundred.  I was scared at all.  Makes timing out your trips faster, math-wise.  I pushed it over 100, 105, and I was like, no way.  That's good enough for me.  I was scared.  Yeah.  Had to bring it right back down.  And you went 180?  It's exhilarating.  Was it awkward when you were checked into the hotel and the boy had to stop you from shooting  yourself and yell, Colonel, no. 
[00:18:30]  After you went and got a prostitute.  What's the matter with you, you idiot?  Now Jimmy talks.  Jimmy's heard enough.  I was listening to this last weekend alive behavior.  You don't have a brain tumor?  Cut the shit.  Jimmy is upset.  Jimmy's mad, but you don't want Jimmy perfect.  You know, you can't control your language when you have such passion for our pal here.  Jimmy basically told Anthony to cut the ass. 
[00:19:00]  Cut the crap.  He's had it.  He's heard enough.  If this was sex, it would be like yelling at Jim Norton.  That's why I feel like I'm watching a self-destroy.  What are you doing?  It's so much fun.  So go to the arcade.  Go fast.  And that's another thing.  I was home Friday when I got home.  I figured, you know, maybe I'll play a little GTA.  Yeah.  So I get on Grand Theft Auto and I'm playing.  And then I'm like, I could just hop in a Ferrari and take my guns down to the range. 
[00:19:30]  And why am I playing this game right now?  When you can live it.  When I could almost live it.  Pretty much live it.  I can't be killing people.  You know how far you have to get into the game to get those cool cars?  I know.  And you just got one at your disposal.  I just go there and load up.  I went to the range.  And your guns are way cooler than what they have in GTA 4 in the beginning.  Oh, I had going to the range.  At one point, I had probably one strap to each hip.  So I was sporting like two. 
[00:20:00]  And then two more in my bag.  Just, you know, checking it out at the range.  How many rounds did you shoot this weekend?  Probably about $400.  $400?  Yeah.  Does that get expensive?  Yeah, they're pretty expensive.  You know, when you're blowing off $400 at a time.  But the guys down there, Coliseum Gun Traders, I got to thank them.  They're good.  They hooked me up with ammo.  And like Jimmy said, when they're giving you free ammo down at the gun store, there's a problem.  Here, kook, here's a box of bullets. 
[00:20:30]  I heard there's more to Supercar Weekend, too.  Because I ran into Anthony at FH Riley's, that fine restaurant my brother runs in Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue.  The pest's pretty much there every weekend now.  And Ant was telling more stories.  Maybe you could continue after the break.  Ah.  Like the neighbors think you have moved at this point.  Oh, there's some.  I didn't forget.  Well, see, my personal assistant is spreading rumors about me. 
[00:21:00]  Well, and then I heard that the...  Did you tell the painting story yet?  No, I haven't.  Oh, you were just, Ant was holding court at FH Riley's, and he had a lot of people laughing  really hard, because the painter saw something.  Yes.  And now Anthony got to pretty much explain himself.  Explain myself to me, the neighbors, everything.  It's just...  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  That's something I cut in a boy's life?  I didn't take those photos myself?  All right, we'll get into more of Supercar Weekend with Anthony Cumia after the break. 
[00:21:30]  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We have lots to do today, too.  We've got to talk about the Kentucky Derby.  Horse goes down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look out.  And poor Travis.  He must be in mourning his Canadians, or his wife's Canadians are out of it.  His wife's team.  The Flyers move on.  The Penguins move on.  They eliminated the Rangers.  Celtics move on in basketball.  And, yeah, we've got lots to do.  We're just getting warmed up here. 
[00:22:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll go on a break with this, and we'll continue.  All right, guys.  All right, an apology from the New York Post for a page 6 story about a sex tape involving  the fiancé radio personality Greg Opie Hughes.  The Post is now saying it was wrong when it reported that Opie's fiancé is involved in  an X-rated video with Bam Margera.  The paper now claims that there is no sex tape, and the radio host's fiancé never even met  the MTV star.  Hi, greetings. 
[00:22:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Happy Monday morning.  Ugh.  Yuck.  Everyone despises getting up early.  Yeah, but it's Cinco de Mayo.  Yeah.  With Gregorio.  Antonio.  Ooh.  By the way, when you were doing the live read for the thing, you said that, I'm sure  I'll tell you it's Mother's Day.  Whoops.  Yes, you did.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You forgot?  Of course. 
[00:23:00]  Jeepers creepers.  You better remember when I saw Daniel pulling out a gun.  Oh, and Travis just doesn't know what to do.  We don't really talk about Mother's Day around here, because half the people that work on staff  hate their mothers, or their mothers left them.  It's just very, very creepy.  Send her some masters.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  You know, it's Cinco de Mayo, so we've got to acknowledge that with this.  It's Cinco de Mayo.  Oh, no. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Maybe we should have a Corona.  I prefer those X-Y's.  What about a Tecate?  Eat the worm.  Eat the worm.  Cinco de Mayo.  Arriba.  Arriba.  Obi Antonio.  Horrible.  I've got to tell you, too.  I've said it a few times.  This bit should have had a very short shelf life.  We know that. 
[00:24:00]  It's really obnoxious and over the top.  But somewhere along the line, I took notice that it really, really bothers Jimmy.  I told Tim, keep them coming.  Keep them coming.  And I think the only reason is just to get under your skin.  That's how twisted I am.  That shelf life should have been.  What's the length of one of those?  That should have been the shelf life.  It's amazing how that hits.  It's like a brick across the teeth.  Jimmy actually takes his headphones off when he hears those promos.  Don't forget to eat the worm. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  Supercar weekend.  But, Anthony, before that, everyone knows by now, actually, the entire show is getting  obsessed with the fact that you're buying a lot of guns and driving fast and you now  carry a gun within your home.  Yeah.  Well, we got another home invasion.  See?  And when these pop up, which is pretty much one a day at this point.  Oh, they just all the time.  They're out there.  They're out there.  We like to throw them on the air and get your opinion on them. 
[00:25:00]  Yes.  Okay?  This one has a nice little twist, though.  Listen to this one.  Women in this complex better close, secure, and lock those glass doors tonight because  one unidentified woman who lives in this condo development on Hannah Road in Edison wished  it was a nightmare last night, but she wasn't having a bad dream.  The naked man standing in front of her was real.  Naked man in front of her.  That's what you want.  That's what you want. 
[00:25:30]  Well, how did he get in?  Well, you're going to lose your mind.  Uh-oh.  This is how he got in.  Our victim was asleep at the time.  Apparently, he goes near her bed, and at one point, he begins to caress her inner thigh  area.  She immediately awakes.  She turns.  She sees that this man is a total stranger, and according to our victim, he was unclothed  at the time.  He was naked.  Lieutenant Shannon now knows he has a sicko on his hands.  If the woman didn't scream, the next step could have been rape. 
[00:26:00]  Luckily, she was not injured.  Making it easy, police say.  The woman's sliding glass door was unlocked, so the nude intruder was able to slip right  in.  Why?  You dummy.  You dummy.  She was asking for it.  What?  I don't mean like the sexual assault.  You can't say that.  She's asking for some kind of crime to happen.  A robbery?  A murder?  Possibly rape?  You're inviting it.  Why would you leave your sliding door? 
[00:26:30]  I'm in agreement with you.  Why would you take that chance?  You've got to lock your doors at night.  That Michael Moore made us all look like crazy people here in America.  Exactly.  Remember his, what was it, bullying for Columbine?  When he went to Canada and everyone had their doors unlocked?  Had their doors open.  And then he looked at America like, we're all just paranoid.  That's Canada, fatso.  It's not here.  You don't leave your doors open here.  Oh, because we're so fearful because of the media.  Yeah, was it a news guy naked rubbing her inner thigh? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, the media's coming in my house.  It was Dan Rather.  Yeah.  He has nothing better than that.  Dan Rather came in nude with a mic.  Right.  Or Tom Brokaw.  Tom Brokaw.  Hello, hello, Ms. Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I was just rubbing your inner thighs, hoping you'd enjoy this.  I'm with the media.  Are you?  What an ass.  I saw your screen, your sliding, sliding, sliding, your sliding, the big glass door. 
[00:27:30]  And the back was left open.  And I decided I was going to come in nude because I'm Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  And it's the media that you have to be afraid of, Missy.  The media.  Now talk into my microphone and I'll talk into the one I'm holding.  The media.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  That Michael Moore is a dunce.  There are things going on.  And whether they are as prevalent as the news likes to say is debatable, of course, but it's  not like they don't happen.  And when they do happen and you're in that situation, you're just going, oh, my God, this  is happening.  You're horrified.  I need a gun.  I need a gun.  Naked guy rubbing your thigh.  You need a gun.  You need a gun.  I'm starting to see it your way, Ant. 
[00:28:30]  Might have to.  Although this one should have, like, locked her doors.  Yeah.  That's just dumb.  Absolutely.  Doors should have been locked.  Crazy woman leaving a door open like that.  Right.  And then we got the media talking to a stupid.  Someone wrote this down because I know I overused the word stupid.  I think it was Sam.  The media talks to a stupid woman who lives in the area.  Jimmy loves when they, you know, talk to the locals about a horrific thing that's going  on in their neighborhood.  They always have something to add that you just wouldn't have thought of. 
[00:29:00]  It's really interesting.  Not even a simple robbery here.  Usually so safe.  That's why people are relaxed here and often let their guard down.  In fact, one whole day I kept the door open and I, you know, went to work.  And when I came back, I wasn't really sure that everything was going to be there and  everything was fine.  And best advice cops say, lock your doors, windows, sliders.  Advice Hema Krishnan will take.  Most of the times it's open.  No, a cop shouldn't have to tell you that.  No.  A cop shouldn't have to say, you know, the best advice that I could give you people 
[00:29:30]  is to lock everything.  It's common sense.  Yeah.  Did you hear how interesting her commentary was?  The one day she went away.  Yeah.  She didn't know what was going to happen.  How do we make 13 episodes out of this for a show?  Good God.  How would you watch that in the newsroom and go, perfect, cut, right there, watch that.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Wonderful.  This is a good job.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I thought things would be there, but they were.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Were they?  I thought things would be okay and they were okay. 
[00:30:00]  Back to you, Frank.  Horrendous.  It's horrendous.  So, there you go.  Another home invasion.  See, you got to watch out.  Absolutely.  Home invasions.  All right.  Getting back to Supercar Weekend there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Supercar Weekend.  FH Riley's.  I was there kind of telling people what was going on with Supercar Weekend.  Mm-hmm.  And, well, one thing was at my house, the painters.  There was that story.  But what was the other one that more involves the. . . 
[00:30:30]  Well, I don't want to. . .  Here.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Sorry, guys.  I'll just write this down.  Wow.  Wait.  Which one?  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Why am I. . .  Yeah, I know.  This is your story.  I have to remind you.  Sorry.  We'll be right back with the Opiate Anthony Show.  Oh, my God.  All right. 
[00:31:00]  How many beers did you have this weekend?  No, I was actually drinking a little bit of wine this weekend.  It was very nice.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Well, my personal assistant at the house that's taking care of a lot of the construction stuff.  Keith.  Your PA.  You got to call him a PA.  Keith and his lovely wife are taking care of things at the house because I'm much too busy.  I noticed you're adding and his lovely wife a lot lately.  Yes.  You're hearing the chatter in the ODA community. 
[00:31:30]  There's the chatter going on where they call him Keith at the top.  Well, it used to just be, you know, me and Keith, me and Keith, me and Keith, but then  the chatter is getting a little louder.  And now you're like, and his wife.  His lovely wife.  His lovely wife.  She's in charge of decorating the house.  Right.  She knows a lot of decorators.  So she's been in there doing the decorating, picking out the paints and curtains, all that  happy horse crap.  And then Keith is there, I guess, to sleep and do my laundry, which he yelled at me, 
[00:32:00]  by the way.  Why did he yell?  He yelled at me because there was too much laundry in the laundry bin for the amount of  time that went by.  Well, on Friday's show, he said that he counted 13 pairs of jeans in a five-day period.  Yeah.  Which is, like, a lot of people will wear two pairs of pants a day, not every day, but  sometimes, yeah.  Maybe through the weekend or something.  Did he yell out at you for the boxers?  He's like, what's this white stuff in the back of all of it?  What have you been seeing? 
[00:32:30]  Well, he, yeah, he was very angry at that.  And I told him I had unpacked a little suitcase thing and threw the dirty clothes in there.  So what do you want me to tell you?  He's now yelling at you.  Yeah, he yelled at me.  He's going to take over your house, you know.  As you go more and more insane, he's going to just completely take over your house.  And then...  And this is perfect music for this, by the way, because Anthony...  I would be an Oscar Madison.  Absolutely.  Keith is kind of a... 
[00:33:00]  Felix Unger.  He's a neat freak.  Yeah.  And so, well, yesterday, of course, it was supposed to be the ultimate supercar weekend day  where we were going to drive and, you know, race the cars.  But I got a real late start.  Let's say.  Yesterday?  Yeah, I got a real late start.  Because I was out at FH Riley's and stuff.  And, you know, a little buzz on and stuff.  And I wanted to sleep in.  Well, Keith comes over. 
[00:33:30]  And I tell him to leave.  He starts playing music because he can pick up a remote in the living room and start blasting  music into my bedroom.  So I just fight back with the remote and blast songs like Go Away and Things Downstairs.  So he left for a little while because I told him, leave.  Just leave the house and I'll be back.  You can come back in like a half hour when I'm ready for you.  You only need a half hour more sleep? 
[00:34:00]  What the hell's going on in your house?  What the hell is going on?  You had to mop up something.  I had to make a quick trip somewhere.  It was just I had things to do.  Let's just say I had things to do.  I don't ask.  So I came back like an hour later instead of a half hour.  And Keith has a pile of my laundry all clean and folded.  And he walks past me, gives me a look, and then just takes the laundry and throws it at 
[00:34:30]  me.  He goes, you said a half hour.  And all the laundry is now strewn on the floor.  He threw it at my head.  And his lovely wife was cracking up sitting in one of the chairs.  You got a married white male problem.  Reworking single white female.  You got a married white male problem.  He threw the laundry at me.  It was very funny.  He's going to show up at your house and he's going to have your mustache soul patch thing. 
[00:35:00]  Is that what he's going to do, you think?  I love myself like this.  I love my facial hair like this.  Well, all right.  So, well, he's been in charge of making sure the workers are there.  And the builder, getting the builder back in to take care of some spackle work and stuff.  So, one day he's there and I'm not.  And one of my neighbors, who happens to be an Indian gentleman, came up and said, what  happened to the man that used to live here? 
[00:35:30]  Because he thought Keith is now the owner of the house.  So, Keith, of course, sees this.  I know why he thinks.  No, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  That's all right.  Because I've been paying attention.  Like, you haven't done anything with your house and you've been there over a year.  All of a sudden, they're seeing a lot of activity.  A lot of action.  They're assuming that it has to be a new owner.  They're finally, like, moving furniture in.  There's painting crews and landscapers coming through.  A lot of things.  And now they see a new guy in the backyard.  They're like, oh, this must be the new owner.  This is the new owner.  That weirdo has left our neighborhood.  Yeah.  The recluse.  So, he asked what had happened to the previous owner. 
[00:36:00]  And Keith, with a straight face, turns to him and says, oh, that guy.  He was arrested for child porn and drugs.  And the guy was like, oh, really?  Really?  And Keith goes, yeah, I got the house at a foreclosure auction.  Picked it up for $600,000.  And the guy goes, you got a good deal.  And Keith was just, he wouldn't let off. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that was something.  Boy, they nailed him.  He was like the head of a big ring.  Oh, my God.  But then I turn up.  So, now he's probably told all the neighbors, remember?  Of course.  And then they see me.  They see me there with, like, exotic cars in the driveway.  You've got to get out with balloons once in a while and stuffed animals because you know  they're watching.  They keep their children away from the house.  Tie some balloons to, like, the front mailbox.  Free candy.  He sees you walking in with girls. 
[00:37:00]  He's like, they look young, but I didn't realize they were 15, 16.  What?  What's he doing in there?  Yeah.  So, he's a smart ass where that's concerned.  And then the painting story.  Yeah.  Well, this is another great Keith thing.  Keith works the late shift.  So, when he's there in the day, he tends to go to his quarters and sleep.  And me, waking up early for this program, especially if it's Jim Day, and I don't mean J-I-M, I mean G-Y-M Day, I got to take a nap. 
[00:37:30]  Because we're pretty much shot right after the show.  So, the painters are working and the painter's helper is there.  And I say, yeah, I got to go take a nap.  I'll see you guys later.  And Keith goes, yeah, I'm going to take one, too.  As he's walking around in his boxers.  He's walking around in his boxers.  So, he's right behind me on the stairs as we're both walking upstairs saying we just needed to take a nap. 
[00:38:00]  And the painters don't understand, or at least the helper, that, like, his room is on the opposite side of my house from my room.  But the guy didn't see that because he was downstairs.  So, he's a Spanish guy.  So, he turns to the painter and goes, Maricon?  Maricon?  What does that mean?  It means gay.  Really?  Like homosexual.  Are they homosexual?  And the painter's trying to explain, no, no, that's his wife that you see here. 
[00:38:30]  But he won't accept it.  He insists that we are gay.  That we are a gay couple living together.  Getting the house painted.  Yeah.  And Keith didn't help when he left the other day.  And the painters are there.  And he goes, all right, sweetie.  I'll see you soon.  Call me later.  You son of a bitch.  Well, of course.  Think some gay.  Hold on.  I got something for you.  Oh.  Let me tell you about my best friend.  He's a warm-hearted person who loved me till the end. 
[00:39:00]  People, let me tell you about my best friend.  He's a one-boy cuddly toy.  My own, my down, my pride and joy.  People, let me tell you about him.  He's so much fun.  Whether we're talking in the middle.  Whether we're talking son to son.  Because he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's my best friend.  No, no, that's the wrong one. 
[00:39:30]  Come on.  You've got a hell of a life.  It's got to be weird to have a friend, huh?  Well, yeah.  You haven't had a friend in many, many years. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, no.  And you've got friends, but not...  You haven't had an active friend since the whole time I've known you.  He's a personal assistant.  Slash friend.  Like a friend.  Don't pay a friend to hang out.  You have to pay someone to hang out with you.  No, no.  I throw him some money because he does the laundry.  He takes care of the contractors and everything.  Takes care of the loneliness.  Helps you get the poison out.  You stop. 
[00:40:30]  That's disgusting and completely inaccurate.  Poor Keith.  I can't picture this.  Oh, Jimmy!  Well, then, if you can't, don't.  Right.  There's no reason for that whatsoever.  Just that nostrils blowing air on your stomach.  The wife is there all the time.  She's downstairs minding her business.  No.  Mayor Cohen, by the way, or whatever you said, it's a little more than gay.  Yeah.  It's the C... 
[00:41:00]  I don't know.  It's the CS word.  Oh, is it?  According to a few people, yeah.  I don't think so.  Yeah, a lot of people are confused.  Let's go to Detroit and talk to Robin.  Robin, what's up?  Yeah, I'm a wee bit confused.  Keith is married, correct?  Yeah.  And he's sleeping at your house.  Where the house is wife sleeping at?  I guess at home.  But it's not like...  No, he's napping at the house, because he's got to be there to supervise the work that's 
[00:41:30]  going on.  So...  Well, he has his own quarters.  So he...  Well, he's dubbed it his own room.  He does have his own room.  He said it's his room.  Yeah.  That's just a little bit sick.  Well, how is it sick that he's just, you know, taking care of the workers that come  in, and then if he's got a nap, you know, before he does the late shift, he's got a  nap.  Now, I haven't seen...  What am I going to do?  I haven't seen Keith's new home, but I have to assume that your house is much nicer, so 
[00:42:00]  why wouldn't he want to stay there when he could?  Why wouldn't his wife want to stay there when she can?  And why wouldn't they want to bring their whole family there when you go off on vacation?  Well, I think that's what he has planned.  They're setting up for the biggie.  He actually didn't even try to be coy about that.  He said that they're helping out.  They're doing all this stuff because when I go away for a couple of weeks, he and his  family are going to live there.  Right.  They'll have a pool. 
[00:42:30]  They'll have a run of the house.  Well, why don't the workers stay there then?  Why aren't they napping at your house?  Because they're working.  Robin, why are you so bothered by this?  I could hear it in your voice.  Well, because I never knew until this morning that Keith was married, and I'm sorry.  That's just downright strange that he has a wife and he's living at Anthony's house.  Anthony's a good-looking, sexy guy, and he's got some guy living in it.  Oh, for God's sake.  He doesn't live there.  Oh, practically.  He's washing your underwear, for God's sake. 
[00:43:00]  He's washing my underwear.  I don't know.  I'm trying to think what it would take for me to wash another man's underwear.  That's a little rough, Anne.  Keith, you know, he touches Tippy Tom.  Yeah.  He brings him into the studio and has no problem, you know, guiding him around.  Yeah, good point.  So, all right.  This reminds me of the casino thing, except the homoerotic way.  It's like you have to, like, when Keith comes over there, he's James Woods, he's gay, and 
[00:43:30]  she's James Woods' character.  So, he has to call and go, but I miss you.  And she's like, just stay.  It's okay.  You understand what I mean?  They go away together.  Him and his wife go away together.  Well, you're home.  Ace.  You're ace.  Long way to go.  I'm ace?  Great.  All right, Robin.  Thank you.  It's nothing like that.  So, I think that wraps up Supercar Weekend for the most part, unless you're leaving  out anything else you want to share with us.  No, that was pretty much it.  It was a great weekend. 
[00:44:00]  Great Supercar Weekend.  Seeing you at FH Riley's, I got to tell you, you look like a very happy man.  Yes.  Because we have a lot of conversations that you're completely losing your mind, but  you were holding court, and it seems like you're really enjoying yourself.  Uh, yeah, it's, you know, a fun, exciting part of my life.  Well, it's exciting for the radio show, too, because we have no idea if you're going to  be here on Monday.  Well, it's fine.  I mean, you really pushed it this weekend.  You openly admitted you got a car up to 180 miles an hour. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Shot off many, many guns.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Blasting off some rounds.  That's nice.  That gets any aggression out.  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  It's pretty therapeutic shooting guns.  When are you going to invite me to the range?  I got to shoot some guns.  Shoot some guns?  I want to shoot some guns.  I might be out there this, uh...  I might be out your way this Wednesday.  Ooh.  Maybe you could pencil me in.  A little gun shooting.  A little gun shooting, and I want to take a look at Keith's room.  I want to make sure you're all right. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  I want to supervise this man-crush of his.  He's well on the other...  He is in the complete opposite wing than I am.  There's a lot in between there.  A lot of real estate between the two rooms.  Yeah.  He's got his own bathroom and everything.  I don't even go in there.  All right.  Takes care of it.  Hey, uh...  When we get back, we're going to start talking about what's going on in the world today.  Got to talk about the Kentucky Derby.  My God, man.  What happened?  Just horrific for everybody in attendance. 
[00:45:30]  We'll get into that next.  Whoopsie.  Also, there's a Helen Keller billboard causing controversy.  Very, very funny.  There's 300 dead cats in a freezer somewhere.  We got a weatherman saying the effing word.  Oh, yeah.  We got lots and lots.  It's been raining.  Phone numbers...  Really hard.  Yeah, yeah.  Some...  Yeah.  Phone numbers 877-212-O-N-A.  Me first, then down the hall.  Hear whatever you know.  It's the first annual B-throwing contest.  From now on. 
[00:46:00]  Coming to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Stay tuned for details.  Good morning.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to say good morning to Buffalo.  Got some nice ratings in Buffalo.  Yes.  I want to say hi to everyone listening on the edge.  Of course, the home of Shred and Reagan.  And, hey, man, thanks.  Seems like people are digging the O.P. and Anthony Show in in Buffalo, New York.  Yeah.  Lived there for, what, over three years? 
[00:46:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  I got to get back there and see some old friends.  Do you?  It's been way too long.  Do you really?  I liked my time in Western New York.  Between Geneseo, Geneva, New York, Rochester, New York, went to Syracuse for concerts, and  Buffalo, you know, spent a lot of time up there.  Well over 10 years.  A little chilly.  Yeah.  It's a little chilly in the winter.  It's still snowing up there.  Yeah.  Dead of winter.  Or that's what we think down here in New York, that you're still getting snow.  Now we've got to say hi to New York City as well, because we have a red alert. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  A red alert.  This is our alert.  It has nothing to do with the terrorist thing.  Oh, good.  Although it could be connected in a little bit of a way.  Wednesday, do not go to work.  Wednesday, do not go to work.  Opie and Anthony are saying, take the day off.  What?  Reverend Al has decided Wednesday's the day to shut down the city.  Wednesday's the day he's attempting to shut down the city, although now he's softening  that a little bit, saying, no, it's a day of prayer. 
[00:47:30]  It's shut down the city day.  We're going to be around New York City just kind of praying.  The Sean Bell thing didn't go his way, so now he's attempting to shut down New York City  for a day.  You know, because 3 o'clock on a Wednesday is a perfect time to protest.  3 o'clock on a Wednesday.  Well, he could have picked a Friday, which would have really been bad.  I don't think this is going to garner sympathy for anybody when you shut the city down.  Is that what you're trying to do? 
[00:48:00]  Because it ain't going to work.  People are just going to be angry.  It's like the beginning of rush hour, and you're going to try to shut the city down?  And by what?  Is it going to be in the streets?  It's...  Like, what's his strategy, his little plan?  Well, I don't think he could openly say we're going to be in the streets and stuff.  I'm not really sure.  He's basically calling it a pray-in.  Sharpton announces pray-in to protest NYPD killing.  Demonstrators plan to pray on their knees and be arrested for civil disobedience. 
[00:48:30]  I hope he's getting arrested, or is he going to let everyone else get arrested around him?  Oh, he loves getting arrested.  He doesn't get arrested these days, though.  He lets everyone else get arrested.  Sharpton, for civil disobedience to protest the acquittals of three police officers in  the death of an unarmed man shot on his wedding day.  The civil rights activist who has promised to close this city down to protest last month's  verdict said protesters would stage a pray-in Wednesday at half a dozen places in the city,  including the police headquarters.  Sharpton said participants would gather at 3 p.m. 
[00:49:00]  3 p.m.  That's when rush hour starts, as Anthony said, in at least six places around the city, and  then fan out to undisclosed locations.  Where we go from there is anybody's guess.  Rachel Nordlinger, Sharpton spokeswoman, said later, adding that wherever protesters end up,  they'll be arrested praying.  The pray-in is only the start of whatever actions are necessary to oppose the verdict.  So I just say, take the day off if you've got a day coming. 
[00:49:30]  Don't even bother yourself with the nightmare that's going to happen this week.  Just, yeah, don't even bother, because, oh, God, to have to deal with that.  I'm going to be long gone.  That's good, so I don't care.  Hey, have fun.  Yeah, but they might start way before three, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  And where is this going to be done?  Like, all over the city?  Who's doing the praying?  You think they're going to be early?  No.  Oh.  Me, me, me, me, me.  They're actually close to start at noon. 
[00:50:00]  That's why they're saying three.  I'm very happy with myself after those last two jokes.  All right, go back to eating cheese.  Jim Norton, everyone.  Also, it's Cinco de Mayo.  Cinco de Mayo.  And the boys down the hall came up with this thing.  To honor this Mexican Independence Day, we bring you the following Minuto in Mexican history.  Minuto is Spanish for a minute. 
[00:50:30]  Ave Maria, que gran pendejo.  Former New York Mets second baseman Felix Mian, also known as El Gatito, we honor you on this  Cinco de Mayo.  Yes, you may be Puerto Rican, but your ability to choke way up on the bat earned you a whopping  22 home runs in your 12-year career in Major League Baseball.  No record-breaking for you, senor.  Performing well enough just to stay employed was good enough.  Your mediocre stats have earned you a permanent place in history, Slayer.  Stay tuned for another Cinco de Mayo Minute on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:51:00]  Que maldito bruto.  Lo siento que tenemos que escuchar a esta basura.  But Felix Mian was, I know he said it in the thing, he's Puerto Rican.  I mean, that was funny and all, but Felix was a Puerto Rican.  Yeah.  And he choked up on the bat more than anybody in Major League history, I do believe.  He would just slap at the ball like that dumb Rod Carew.  Rod Carew had, what, 5,000 singles and 28 doubles in his career?  Yeah.  He had a bloop single. 
[00:51:30]  He was a bloop hitter.  Like, right, it would just clear the infield.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  We'll have more of those as the morning goes on here.  Ken in Philly, I did hear about this, Ken.  Go ahead.  Yeah, if Anthony can ring the bell three times, three bell rings.  Three bell rings.  A Philadelphia cop on Saturday with an SKS assault rifle.  Are you guys aware of what's going on in Philly?  Cops are being shot.  Three cops in a year, man.  Yeah.  Three cops in a year.  They've lost three cops in the last year alone down in Philly.  It is a war zone. 
[00:52:00]  Three white cops.  It's that.  Were they shot by black guys, sir?  Were they shot by both?  All by black guys.  Give me all by black guys.  And what was the weapon?  Because I stepped on you.  That's a KS assault rifle.  Yeah?  It went to an AK-47.  I'm sure Andy knows that.  Will that do some damage, Anthony?  Yeah.  I heard they hunted one of the guys down and killed him?  Yeah.  I don't know if they killed him, but the SWAT teams are out all weekend, you know, banging  on doors, man.  Yeah, it is.  They're looking for two other guys.  It's pretty scary in Philly in some of these neighborhoods, man. 
[00:52:30]  You guys aren't coming around for the virus this year or what?  I don't think so.  We were going to take the year off, but then New Jersey, the PNC, we do so well with ticket  sales that they kind of begged us to do the show this summer.  And we're very excited now that we're going to do it.  You should just purchase Homebill tickets in, right?  Yes, you should.  No tweeter?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  We're not going to do Philly, but, I mean, you guys, we hope you guys come up to the  PNC Arts Center show on Saturday, August 2nd. 
[00:53:00]  We're going to be announcing the lineup in the very near future, but tickets are on sale  now through Ticketmaster.com.  But we were definitely going to...  Oh, boy.  I just think, man...  I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just think, you know, with all this crap going on in New  York, you know, where's Reverend Al when this stuff happens, you know?  Yeah, well, that's obvious.  And what kind of...  Nowhere.  Sorry.  What, Jimmy?  No, I thought he was talking about it.  Nah.  What kind of dummy...  This is why the mafia was very successful, and a lot of these other guys are just dumb  thugs.  Because, from a completely business point of view, the mafia knew you don't go after 
[00:53:30]  cops, because then the cops do things like SWAT teams kicking doors all over the place.  It's like, you disrupt business.  That's one reason they were allowed to function for so long, is because they paid people, they  didn't go out and kill innocent children in drive-by shootings, and they knew not to  kill cops.  I mean, it's amazing.  People are like, oh, it's racist.  They let the mafia...  No, the mafia wasn't stupid.  They understood the things that were going to turn all citizens against them. 
[00:54:00]  They understood the things that were going to turn even Italians against them.  People will put up with murder if it's done among guys who are in that life.  When's the last time you heard of a mob drive-by where innocent women and children were shot?  I mean, I can't...  I'm sure it's happened somewhere, but almost never.  I'm a huge fan of the mafia.  Huge fan.  You like the mafia?  Absolutely.  Always have.  Not even joking.  They knew how to take care of business.  Yeah, I don't like the fact that they went after a small business owner.  I think they extorted a lot of innocent people. 
[00:54:30]  A little strong-arm tactics, yeah.  Yeah, guys that didn't have...  John Gotti made his neighborhood safe.  Yes, he did.  Gotta respect that.  And had a fine fireworks show for everybody.  Yeah.  For the community every year.  Yeah.  I still don't like the way they extorted people, but aside from that, at least they weren't  shooting kids in drive-by.  They weren't spraying machine guns in the crowds.  Mm-mm.  But they were pretty precise.  Two guys eating veal, both dead.  Yeah, exactly.  They knew their targets.  Oh, boy, they did.  They knew how to play the game.  And those photos of the mob murders, boy, they didn't just take one little shot with 
[00:55:00]  a .22.  No.  No.  It's always some guy slumped over in a bowl of linguine with like 40 shots of something.  Just gallons of blood everywhere.  And no one else got it.  His face is gone.  With a cigar still hanging out of his mouth.  Yeah, that's a classic one.  Six guys gunned down.  I think it was Castellano and his bodyguard, whose name I don't remember, out in front of  Sparks, we all know.  In broad daylight, rush hour, no one else got shot.  Mm-hmm.  No.  Six guys killed two guys, one of who was armed, and they both were the only ones that got 
[00:55:30]  shot.  Amazing.  All right, Ken.  I...  Hey, Ed.  Yo.  I just want to let you know, they also found a .44 Magnum in the car and some Muslim clothing  and $38,000 in cash.  Oh, yeah?  So what do you want from Anthony?  Yeah, what's the matter?  Are you...  Hey, I'm just letting you guys know these guys are animals out here in Philly, man.  See, because I'm starting to really listen to what Anthony has to say about the guns  and stuff.  And let's say you make some of those guns illegal.  They're going to get these guns. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, they get them.  Yeah, they're going to get them anyway.  That's not going to stop the...  That's not going to stop the crime.  I want to know if any of the police officers killed were killed with illegal weapons that  were purchased legally.  Were these perpetrators the legal owners of these guns?  No, of course not.  I almost escaped from a half-white house.  I doubt he had a gun.  So the solution is never to just make more laws against law-abiding citizens. 
[00:56:30]  It's ridiculous.  Stupid.  I don't have a handgun myself.  I have two daughters.  I mean, come on.  All right, Ken.  Thank you.  The daughters of my house are getting blown away.  So I saw, too, they're really starting to question Obama on the Second Amendment.  He gives different answers depending on who he's talking to.  If he's talking to a liberal crowd, he'll say that he's really for gun control and eliminating  automatic weapons or semi-automatic weapons.  And then he talks to rural areas, and he's Mr. Second Amendment. 
[00:57:00]  They all do that.  Every politician does that.  Lying sack.  Every single one of them caters to the crowd they're in front of.  No matter what the issue.  And Hillary actually jumped on that and said that, oh, Obama isn't for the Second Amendment.  And trying to make herself sound like she is that phony.  What is she now?  A Republican?  She's a phony.  Either one of them, if they got in and had their way, the Second Amendment would be just 
[00:57:30]  trotted upon by both of them.  All right.  Let's say hi to Brian.  He's got a little more info.  Brian.  Hey, okay, Anthony.  The officer was shot with the SKS.  He was shot five times through the door of the police car.  Jesus.  And the perpetrator that shot him was gunned down later in the day by four Philly cops  that came upon him.  So they took him out, and they got another guy, and he just spilled his guts. 
[00:58:00]  So now they're just looking for one guy.  And he did.  He escaped from a halfway house in Redding, and he's on the run.  But the FBI SWAT teams have been out all over the area and just taking care of business.  I'll bet he's going to get in Dutch.  Yeah, you think?  Unbelievable.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  No problem.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Phil, who's listening on the edge in Buffalo.  What's up, Phil?  I just wanted to get warmer out here in Buffalo.  We need TNA back.  Oh, TNA with ONA.  Oh, well, hey. 
[00:58:30]  I don't think you'll.  Oh, I don't think.  We were supposed to be fired for that.  Oh, that was good times.  They were getting close to firing us for TNA with ONA.  Yeah.  Then we gave them a real good reason.  Yeah, then we made it very easy with the Sex for Sam thing.  That was the summer of us just being completely out of control.  Completely out of control.  We're trying to bring the virus show to Buffalo.  Now that we're doing one, now we're like, all right, now we've got to do a couple at least. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, I know.  We're going to be doing these all summer.  We're thinking Buffalo and we're thinking Boston.  We'll do a nice little three.  Yes, Jimmy.  Is it illegal for me to say over the air that I hope somebody gets shot?  Why?  For stalking Uma Thurman.  Is it illegal for me to say that I just wish that would happen to him?  What's going on with this Uma Thurman thing?  I'm looking at this picture in the paper and he's just the most.  Imagine if that was your girl and this creep was making her laugh.  I mean, there are times I think when the police, I think we as a society have to look at people like that and go, you know what? 
[00:59:30]  He can be squashed like a roach.  Yeah, and the world will not suffer for it.  They'll wait and they'll have these stupid lawyers and judges talk people into letting him go.  Oh, he's just a fan.  He's not dangerous.  Right up until he kills her.  And then it'll be, well, there's a tragedy.  And the lawyer, well, you know, I just had to defend my client.  It happens every time. 
[01:00:00]  What has this guy done, Jimmy?  Just to get everyone up to speed.  Sent her creepy stuff.  Very creepy letters.  He just shows up everywhere.  He's in love with it.  He's called the family.  Called her mother and father.  Threatening suicide.  Attack with a brother, yeah.  Drawn some really odd things.  He sent her a picture he drew of somebody with a razor blade and a coffin.  It's some weird, he's just a creep.  Creep stalker that, yeah, guys like that, there's no, if he's not on this planet, how much worse off are we going to be, really? 
[01:00:30]  Just squash him.  Well, the closing arguments in that trial, I think, start today.  So, we'll see what happens to this guy, if they do anything with him.  He might go to jail for a little while, but he'll get out, because they can't force him to take his medication.  Hopefully, another prisoner, which won't happen, will just do something awful to him.  Yeah.  That would be nice.  It certainly would. 
[01:01:00]  Just victimizing her.  She's just trying to do her job.  Yeah.  That annoys me.  Let's go to Andrew in New Mexico.  Andrew.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, how you doing?  How you guys doing?  Good, man.  Hey, you guys talking about Cinco de Mayo.  I don't mean to change the subject here, but happy Cinco de Mayo.  You all know what Cinco de Mayo is.  It's the 5th of May.  That's right.  Well, no.  Not only that.  It is the independence of Mexico from France. 
[01:01:30]  Oh.  I thought it was how many dollops of mayo Iraq likes to put on everything.  Well, he's celebrating Cinco de Mayo.  Oh, f***.  Very good.  It's also bad.  I got so excited, I wanted to jump right in there with you.  He's celebrating Cinco de Mayo.  Mayo.  Yes.  I already had the Mayo joke, so why would I say that?  Thanks for helping me out.  Well, yeah.  Travis just put a sombrero on stupid Iraq. 
[01:02:00]  There you go.  Now you guys are celebrating.  I honestly don't celebrate it myself, but a lot of...  Yes, go ahead.  Well, why don't you give us more info on Cinco de Mayo?  Yeah, a little history.  De Mayo.  Well, pretty much that's all I know.  Down here in New Mexico, everybody gets drunk.  Then why would you keep talking?  If that's all I know, why would anything come after that?  Why is everyone...  I don't understand.  Why is everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo by hanging outside Home Depot today? 
[01:02:30]  I don't know what I mean.  It's really weird.  Why are they hanging out on every single corner?  Because they want a job.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  I know how much you love Home Depot.  What?  Yeah, we love Home Depot.  I had such a good joke, too, he stepped on it.  I was going to say, it's Cinco de Mayo, where I drink decaf all my time.  That's a good one, too. 
[01:03:00]  Cinco de Mayo.  This guy's call was Cinco de Mayo.  I keep getting the beep.  What's wrong with me?  I don't know.  Yeah, wait, wait.  Oh, Andrew.  Endless with this guy.  Andrew.  Enough.  You're glad me up, man.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  All right, goodbye.  All right, don't stalk us.  Thanks.  Cinco de Mayo?  Oh, no!  Oh, yeah!  Maybe we should have a Corona.  I prefer Dos Equis. 
[01:03:30]  What about a Tecate?  Eat the worm.  Eat the worm.  Cinco de Mayo!  Arriba!  Arriba!  Toby Antonio!  Oh, boy.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  I think that one annoyed me, and I'm the one that's a big fan of that whole thing.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, before we take a break, I just want to read this one time here, Anthony. 
[01:04:00]  The New York Post, page 6.  I hope everyone picks up the post and reads page 6 today, because it's a very, very good  day for my girl.  A victory.  Yeah, a slight victory.  More to come.  But, like, we've been harassed for about a year and a half over alleged sex tape, a fake  sex tape, and it all came to a head when the post decided to go with this ridiculous rumor.  And the post did the right thing today, I'll say that much, and they printed a retraction 
[01:04:30]  on page 6 today.  It says, for the record, on April 23rd, we reported that the fiancé of Greg Opie Hughes,  one half of the Opie and Anthony radio show, was involved in an X-rated sex video with MTV  star Bam Margera.  We reported that Hughes was taking legal actions against a disgruntled ex-employee of the radio  duo who had acquired the rights to the video.  We have since learned that this information supplied by Stepping Out's Chauncey Hayden  was entirely incorrect. 
[01:05:00]  Once again, we have since learned that this information supplied by Stepping Out's Chauncey  Hayden was entirely incorrect.  We have since learned that this information supplied by Stepping Out's Chauncey Hayden was  entirely incorrect.  There is no sex tape.  Further, Hughes' fiancé has never met the MTV star.  The post sincerely regrets the error.  This is a very, very good day for my girl.  We learned on Friday that this was going down, and for the first time in, I don't know, 
[01:05:30]  like 10, 11 days, she became happy.  Well, good.  And she decided to leave our apartment.  Good.  So things are turning around, and we couldn't be happier about that.  That certainly covers a couple of things.  It's vindication.  It gets the truth out there.  And it makes Chauncey look like the inaccurate journalist, I've got to find a different word, 
[01:06:00]  that he is.  Yeah.  I've got to be careful what I say.  Oh, I understand.  I understand.  I've got to be very careful.  But that was, as the post printed, you know, an accuracy that he came up with and gave  the post.  Right.  And I know where the rumor came from, and I am going after that individual, and I know  there's at least two more individuals involved, and I'm not playing, man. 
[01:06:30]  Obviously.  I am not playing.  This is going to get ugly.  This is not the end of this.  I can say that much.  I can say that much.  Good.  And then Dave writes, don't pug Opie.  He's having a moment.  So it's a very good day.  And I do want to thank the Pest and the real listeners of this radio show that knew from  the beginning what this whole deal was about.  And I really appreciate all the support you guys have given in emails, on message boards, 
[01:07:00]  in person.  Actually, people have been mailing me cards the last week and a half.  Really, really, really nice.  And I greatly appreciate that.  And my girl greatly appreciates that.  Okay?  Cool.  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll continue.  We've got to talk about Kentucky Derby Day.  Yeah.  Wow.  What a fun day that must have been down there.  And you know what Horace Hillary picked, right?  Yes.  And you know what Horace Obama picked, right?  Yes.  All right.  We'll get into it next.  It's a pretty interesting story. 
[01:07:30]  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  8-7-7-2-1-2-0-1-A.  Getting back into the swing of things.  After a long weekend.  I forgot to tell you, I had 35 women in my place on Saturday.  The Philly crew came up on a party bus, and I had to entertain 35 women in my apartment  for two hours before they went off to see Wicked.  Jimmy's just shaking his head. 
[01:08:00]  I don't have to say that.  Huh?  Why?  Why?  Well, it's real life crap, Jimmy.  You guys have figured out a way to avoid real life crap, and you know, I respect that.  So, dealing with 35 women in your place was being at FH Riley's.  What do you mean?  You were at FH Riley's.  Oh, I bailed.  You're right.  Yeah, exactly.  So, that's how you dealt with it.  By leaving.  No, I had to entertain them in my apartment to get them. 
[01:08:30]  They took a party bus off.  Did you dress like a cop, but then have Velcro pants?  Yeah.  How were you entertaining them?  I was making the mimosas, and I was pouring the white wine, and making sure everyone had  food.  I was running around like a crazy person.  35 women, though?  35.  It might have been closer to 40.  Why all women?  How come then the guys went?  It was, well, the guys, the Philly crew, they were watching the derby.  Is he wicked?  They came up on the party bus, and all of a sudden the doorbell rings, and all of a sudden 
[01:09:00]  there's 10 women at the front door.  They come in, then the elevator takes the next 10 up, then the next elevator takes another  10 up.  It was endless.  Endless.  And then they all bailed and went to Wicked, and then Hard Rock Johnny took care of them  at the Hard Rock Cafe.  They had a fine little weekend in New York City.  But wait, how many women are in that family?  It doesn't make sense.  It was friends and family, and then it was the women on my side, so they're meeting the 
[01:09:30]  women on my girl's side.  They were discussing recipes and discussing menstruation cramps and all sorts of whatever.  This is what women do when we're not around.  Horrendous.  It was just like a low hum, a low buzzing in your ears.  Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip,  like putting your head in a chicken coat.  It was very interesting, yeah. 
[01:10:00]  It was quite interesting.  I'm trying to listen to my Robert Palmer tape, but my supposed fiancee keeps buzzing in my  ear.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, Opa.  It must have been a little difficult entertaining 35 women all sitting cross-legged on the floor,  you no-furniture-owning bastard.  I'm a big boy now.  I actually got a brand new couch.  I actually rented chairs, so they had other places to sit. 
[01:10:30]  You rented chairs?  I got a big table for the food that was catered.  I did the real thing for once.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.  I know, I know.  I just got to realize, by I, insert the word Kenny.  Bring Kenny in.  No way.  Bring Kenny in.  Kenny didn't rent the chairs for you?  Because I forgot to tell him.  I would have rented the chairs, GH.  Look, here comes Kenny.  Kenny, are you insulted that I actually did something by myself? 
[01:11:00]  Here's my PA, by the way.  Am I on thin ground, GH?  A thin ground?  What the hell are you doing?  Thin ground?  I'm on thin ground.  I got one foot on a banana peel and the other in a grave.  Yeah.  I'm very surprised.  He had to get his own chairs?  You guys don't even know what you're doing.  I will get the email later.  Is everything okay?  I don't understand why you would actually do something without me.  Why would you do anything? 
[01:11:30]  Do you need me to bring him back?  Do you need me to call the guy to get him?  I actually even called the guy and they took him away already, too.  It was weird.  It's kind of weird doing stuff for yourself.  I'm listening to you.  It's really bizarre.  It's hysterical.  Really, really bizarre.  It's strange not having Kenny involved.  And honestly, my girl did pretty much everything.  Did.  Okay.  That's also another thing I was kind of thinking.  I went to the supermarket with her. 
[01:12:00]  She picked up all the stuff.  You pushed the cart, right?  I pushed the cart around.  It's the man's job.  And I was there to make sure she didn't go crazy.  I'm like, look, 35 women.  Get enough food for 20.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  But it worked out.  There were like two sandwiches left at the end.  Oh, really?  You squeaked it out?  Because everyone makes the mistake.  35 people get food for 35 people.  No.  There's people that are not going to eat.  They might feel bad to eat like this.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Yeah.  I'm really hungry, but there's only two left. 
[01:12:30]  Two bologna sandwiches.  It's a little worse than a baggie.  Oh, man.  She wanted to buy four or five bottles of wine.  I said, two.  Two bottles of wine for 35 people.  For 35 people?  And then I broke out all the free champagne we've gotten over the years from all the comedy  clubs, the nice Dom.  Yeah.  So I had that laying around.  I'm like, let's get some orange juice.  We'll make some mimosas or mimosas, whatever.  Mimosa.  However the hell you say it. 
[01:13:00]  They were there for two hours?  Huh?  Two hours.  Yeah.  And then they didn't come back, right?  No.  Then I cleaned up and I took off.  I wanted to be a part of Anthony's supercar weekend, but it didn't happen.  No.  Sorry.  Mark in Jersey, what's up?  Why not?  You should have hopped in the party bus and raced him down the LA.  What do you got, Mark?  Hey, didn't you just say that all of a sudden they showed up at your door?  Yeah.  And then you went on to say you had rented chairs, you had it catered.  Oh, no. 
[01:13:30]  I didn't mean all of a sudden.  I meant...  We planned this in advance, of course.  But then the moment came, I guess is what I was saying, and all of a sudden they just started  arriving.  You made it sound like that all of a sudden, you know...  They just showed up.  A couple women.  Yeah, no, I'm sorry.  A couple women showed up.  No, this was...  You know how women are.  Because I was dragged into this.  They've been planning this for six to eight months.  If guys are planning something, we'll start planning maybe two days in advance.  Tops.  The phone calls that were going back between my girl and Philly were just endless for 
[01:14:00]  the last six months.  Did he collect their money?  And they all collected the money in advance.  All this.  Yeah.  Guys aren't like that.  What we put up for the snatch.  Huh?  What we put up with for the snatch.  Wow.  You're right.  You're right.  All right.  Hey, Kentucky Derby.  So...  What happened?  Wow, man.  Oh.  Wow.  Well, Big Brown won the Kentucky Derby.  Big Brown won.  And that happened to be...  Obama's pick.  Obama's, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  I was going to say Obama's horse, but then people would think that he has a derby horse.  He doesn't.  But he put his money on Big Brown.  Uh-huh.  And Big Brown won the Kentucky Derby.  And then the horse that came in second place, I think, was the only female horse in the race.  Oh.  Uh, well, broke both ankles.  Terrible.  And it was Hillary's horse.  That was the horse Hillary picked.  Hillary picked, uh, what was the name?  Eight Bells or something like that?  Eight Bells.  Yeah, yeah.  The story goes like this.  Uh, tragedy struck the first filly in the Kentucky Derby since 1999. 
[01:15:00]  Phillies, for the most part, don't run in the Derby.  Uh, as Eight Bells went down on the track after her second place finish today, broke two  ankles, and was euthanized.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, poor thing.  Wait, Hillary picked a horse, and it had to be killed.  Yeah.  If only the situation were reversed.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Horse went to vote for her.  Bad news, horse.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  How great is this story?  Showing a sisterhood with the female horse.  Senator Hillary Clinton, uh, during a trip to Louisville this week, had said she was going  to bet on Eight Bells to win place and show.  ABC News' Karen Travers reports that Clinton told supporters in Jefferson, Indiana earlier  this week, I hope that everybody will go to the Derby on Saturday and place just a little  money on the filly for me.  I won't be able to be there this year.  My daughter's going to be there, and so she has strict instructions to bet on Eight Bells.  All right.  Uh, Travers also points out that Eight Bells trainer Larry Jones returned the law off. 
[01:16:00]  It looks like it could be the year for the girls, he said.  Eight Bells, I'm sure, would want to endorse.  Uh, the horse, Senator Barack Obama picked the show.  Uh, Big Brown won the Derby.  Obama had picked, uh, Colonel John to win.  Okay, so he didn't even pick Big Brown to win.  He didn't?  Oh, that makes...  What did he do?  I thought he said he picked it.  He picked Big Brown to show. 
[01:16:30]  Oh.  Win place or show.  Right, of course.  Obama had picked Colonel John to win.  He came in sixth.  Of course it's going to show.  I mean, one horse just stops running.  So he'll show.  Well.  Yeah.  That is just horrific when a horse goes down, man.  Well, the reason she picked it was because it had thinner ankles and smaller teeth.  He stinks.  Bad luck.  Oh, my God.  The horse goes down, breaks two ankles, and then they brought out the truck.  Yeah.  And then they, I guess they put up a whole tent system. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, they kind of got to put a tent up around the horse.  And all those, all those dopes that go down there for the big race where they're oversized  hats.  Yeah.  Have to sit there and watch this horrific scene play out in front of them as they're  killing the horse on the track.  People.  People.  Oh, good Lord.  Oh, good Lord.  Oh, good Lord. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, good Lord.  Wow.  I like the fact that the whole time 
[01:18:00]  the horse was running in that clip  it was whinnying.  Yeah, like they do that.  Putting its front little hooves up.  Oh, you know.  Horse didn't run.  Just whinnied a little bit.  We can do what we can here, you know.  Wow.  How depressing.  Just trying to enjoy a hot dog.  You can watch the tent go up.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:18:30]  Unbelievable.  So not a good day at the track yesterday.  How do they kill it?  They use a needle, I'm sure.  Probably, yeah.  The old days.  That gunshot sound coming out of the tent.  That would be something.  When was the last time they used a gun?  I think there was a time when we were growing up.  Oh, yeah.  Where they would just shoot it in the head, I think.  Somebody help us out.  But I think that's, they had to take one horse out that way.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  I'm thinking late 70s, somewhere around there.  If someone has info on that.  Shoot him in his big, long horse head.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  The guy doesn't know what he's doing, so he shoots him right by where the nose is.  You got to go higher towards the plane.  And he's just, oh.  Machine guns him from, like, the nose all the way up to the top of the head.  Shoots him in the nose.  Like, Sonny laying there at the toll booth.  He goes in there, sweep up the nose.  The horse is like, you see the horse, the guy's like, all right, done.  And the horse's eye just blinks like, hey, stupid, you missed.  It's a long head.  Let's go to Pat.  Pat, what's up?  Oh, Pat?  Yeah.  Okay, you're there.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey. 
[01:19:30]  I was at the Meadowlands with my kids on a family picnic, and the horse just croaked right  in front of us.  Really?  Right in front of the kids?  Yeah, they put the tent around them.  They're like, why, Daddy?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Oh, it's okay, son.  They're giving them a bath.  All of a sudden, they put up the tent, and the next sound you hear is a chainsaw.  That's why they put the tent up, because they don't want you to see how they have to load 
[01:20:00]  it.  Right.  They have to break all four of its legs, and then put a big tube through it, like through  the mouth, like a spigot.  Yeah, there's not a truck out there where you can put a stiff horse in its entirety in it.  You got to cut off something, I'm thinking.  Do you think the horse is panicking if he sees the tent going up?  Because she's run so many times, she's like, oh, no, the tent is not going up.  Oh, I know what this tent means.  Is this a congratulations ceremony?  I don't think so.  They're all quiet. 
[01:20:30]  I don't think I won.  She's looking for champagne, flowers around her neck, anything.  The big trophy.  Yeah.  The guy comes in with a surgical mask and a needle.  She's like, oh, this is no good.  Can't feel my shoes.  My shoes.  That's so horrible.  And all the stupid people that are there with their big, dumb derby hats.  Yeah.  Like all the women that go there have to have those big, dumb derby hats on.  And they're all sitting there like, oh, this is such a great time. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Is anyone crying?  They all have to.  Well, at least they got their hats to cry into.  Cry into your big, stupid hat.  Fill up your dumb hat with tears.  See a forklift come out.  Those forklift wheels, the telltale forklift wheel marks across the track.  Yeah.  They're like rarely ever forklift marks.  But when they're there, you know what it's for.  Or you see the guy come out with 30 pitchforks over his shoulder.  He's going to hand it out to the crew.  Oh, no. 
[01:21:30]  Poor horse.  I like to just see a truck with chains.  Just like hook up the horse and just drag them across the entire track.  Because, you know, that's where they leave the track.  Is there a video of that happening?  Yeah, I wonder how they do that.  Like what the whole thing is.  The tent, and then they kill it.  And then they can't just winch it into a truck in front of everybody.  So how do they get it from the tent to the truck?  Do they back the truck in the tent?  You think they just play really happy music for everybody? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, because it's...  Yeah.  Let's all sing along.  You can't, like...  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, don't pay no attention to the tent at the far end of the track.  There's been a little problem with one of the horses.  It seems to have, I don't know, an eyelash in its big eye.  And the doctors are now working very diligently trying to...  Trying to get it out of its eye. 
[01:22:30]  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  He'll be just fine.  Fine.  He's going to be fine.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Going to be back at the stable in no time.  For the kids out there, I just want to let you know that the horse got a little sleepy. 
[01:23:00]  Decided to take a little nap.  A nap.  We're going to be taking him away in this truck.  Yeah.  Because he's just sleepy.  He's very...  Oh, look at that.  No, that's some kind of a cherry...  Cherry...  Sunday topping, kids.  Coming out from under the tent.  You can get some ice cream in there.  Can the announcer explain why the horse was short?  Shot like 40 times with pauses? 
[01:23:30]  And why it fell after it had already fallen?  Because they gave the honor of shooting the horse to New York's new governor.  Oh, wow.  No, sir, that was the winner.  Oh, no.  There's a happy fan.  Oh, my goodness.  That was a jockey.  Gov, you just took a lady's hat off.  The horse is over here.  Oh, boy.  And now he's having sex with the other horse and not telling his wife. 
[01:24:00]  Okay, now he's doing cocaine with one of the horses.  Let's say hi to Travis in New Hampshire.  Travis, what's up?  I assume you're listening on BCN.  How are you, buddy?  What's up, mother huckers?  Hey, it's catchphrase Monday.  What do you got, Travis?  So, I was reading the front of MSNBC.com,  and I guess PETA wrote a long letter to the Kentucky Derby outrage  because apparently the ankles of the horse were broken before the finish line. 
[01:24:30]  Did you guys, E-Rock, pull that up.  Oh, really?  I like how the audience is giving E-Rock orders.  E-Rock, pull that up, dummy.  Put down the garlic butter sauce and pull that up.  So, I hear they want the, you were saying they want the jockey suspended  because the jockey knew that this horse was in trouble with a possible fracture  or a broken ankle.  Hey, you're there to win.  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  What good are they if they're not winning this damn thing?  If you're almost by the finish line in NASCAR and you blow a front tire, 
[01:25:00]  keep going.  All right, we're going to look that up.  Craig on Long Island.  Craig.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  See, the winning horse should be able to drag the dead horse's carcass off the field.  Like a victory, a little victory dance thing.  They would have done that in Roman times.  Is there a second place ceremony?  Like the horse is laying there on the track and they throw like a little wreath on it?  There you go.  There you go.  Congrats.  Yeah.  A wreath and a team.  Unbelievable. 
[01:25:30]  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Mick in Jersey who used to work at the Meadowlands.  Mick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  Jimmy bought your book.  I didn't like it.  I loved it.  Oh, wow.  I read your book, you magnificent bastard.  Patton.  I used to work at the Meadowlands and that horse ambulance is nothing more than a flatbed  pickup truck with a couple of sides and a roof on it.  And what they do is, as we're holding the curtain up, they pull out a big noose attached 
[01:26:00]  to the cable and they wrap it around the horse's neck and just drag it right onto the flatbed  truck and haul it away to the restaurant.  Well, it's alive?  To the restaurant.  To the restaurant.  After they put it down.  To the restaurant.  To the restaurant.  Good eats.  Thank you.  We got someone not happy.  Lisa, Long Island.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, Lisa.  I've been a K-Rock fan and a Long Islander for all of my 40 years.  Atta girl, Lisa.  Thanks for calling.  All right.  Back again.  And what's the matter?  Well, what's the matter, Lisa?  Maybe we could talk this out. 
[01:26:30]  Humor is in the worst taste I have ever heard.  Maybe we can talk it out, though.  Did you want the shoes and they didn't give them to you?  I'm ashamed to be a Long Islander and I'll never listen to K-Rock again.  But I want to know what you heard that you didn't like.  I'm ashamed to be a Long Islander.  How can you be ashamed of this horrific things that happen in other places of the country?  What didn't you like, Lisa?  Yeah, what's wrong?  Animal person.  Are you a fan of the Opie and Anthony show?  Let's start there.  I can't believe the choice of humor. 
[01:27:00]  Do you think that's funny?  Yes.  Do you think that's intelligent?  I'm actually disappointed.  I'm actually disappointed in us.  I thought we could have done an even better job with the humor.  Well, what part of the humor did you like, Lisa?  If you really want to know the truth.  Yeah, what didn't you like?  What part didn't you like?  The sound effects are particularly insulting.  Which line?  How old are you?  Was it this one?  Was it this one?  Or was it this one?  Yeah, that's one, guys.  Or this one.  Oh, the horse stayed up after that. 
[01:27:30]  That's my personal favorite.  Yeah.  Like that.  Can I ask why you're ashamed to be a Long Islander?  Yeah.  First of all, when were you proud of that?  And there were plenty of reasons before this.  Yeah.  And Colin Ferguson didn't do it for you.  Yeah.  But the jokes on this show make you...  I was born and raised on Long Island.  Well, actually, born in Queens, moved out to Long Island.  If you want to be very specific.  And I've been ashamed of Long Island way before.  Way before this.  Of course.  Yeah, why, Lisa?  You know what?  You should do us all a favor and move somewhere else, buddy. 
[01:28:00]  Hey, pally.  Should we, Lisa?  Talk to the hand.  Should we?  You little girl.  You dummy.  She hung up.  Why?  She hung up.  Of course she did.  She got us.  Keep listening, Lisa.  Oh, yeah.  Look at Steve from Baseball.  Sure.  Or, oh, this Lisa, a sassy one.  What'd she say?  She's been a Long Islander her whole life.  Her whole life.  A K-Rock listener?  That's embarrassing.  All of my 40 years.  All of my 40 years.  It's great.  40, and she's all upset at the sound effects.  Shut up. 
[01:28:30]  Go watch Regis then.  Well, obviously, the naked billboards are attracting some new listeners to this fine radio station  here in New York City.  I saw those naked billboards all weekend long when I was driving around.  They got the backs of some hot women on those things.  You know that?  They had to airbrush the boobage, the side boobage out.  Side boob, yeah.  These billboards, Jimmy, they had it like, these girls were very well endowed, and they  had to actually brush out the side boobage.  Yeah, because the side boob was showing.  Basically, the advertising here in New York, The Rock of New York is back, and then it has girls 
[01:29:00]  completely naked, and The Rock of New York is back, is right over their butts, so you  don't see their butts.  And then on their backs, it says Pink Floyd, Ozzy, Nirvana, Linkin Park, Green Day, Guns  and Roses, Zeppelin, ACDC, Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, it goes on and on, and they're  all over New York.  So it's attracting new listeners to this radio show.  Yeah.  And this radio station.  Her poor husband.  Oh, that poor emasculated douche.  I haven't answered feedback.  A lot of Zs.  Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z.  Cool. 
[01:29:30]  And then this guy writes, it's Dan from Sayerville, he writes, I agree with her, you guys should  move on, stop beating a dead horse.  Did you hear that, Lisa?  Very nice.  Let's say hi to Brian in Chicago.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Well, something that you guys haven't hit on yet, it was so rare for a filly to be in 
[01:30:00]  the derby that when a filly actually came in second, the owners and the family were just  going bananas in the crowd, going crazy, jumping up and down, and then they look over and say,  wait, what's going on with our horse?  Yeah.  Why are there ambulances around our horse?  I'd give anything to see.  Well, I think they figured it out before the ambulance arrived.  Yeah.  What did they just, like, they would, I would love to see them jumping up and down and then  watch as the jump slowly stopped in the arms.  And the smiles go away and the look of, yeah. 
[01:30:30]  And who picked that straw at the track?  Do they got dead horse guy that just sits there waiting for his opportunity?  Like, hey, I'm on.  It's me.  This is great.  They know because the horse stood up on its hind legs going, ow, ow, ow, with the front  hooves, ow.  Their wrists were bent.  They thought it was doing a gay impression.  Like a swishy gay impression that you did in grammar school.  Look at how the horse is funny.  That's a funny horse.  Crack up.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate, what's up? 
[01:31:00]  Hey, guys.  Good morning, Nate.  Yeah, so Lisa from Long Island draws the line at the horse thing.  I guess she wasn't listening on Remove Your Hat Day.  Lisa from Long Island's a boob.  Keep that under your hat.  I'm ashamed to be a Long...  All right, just why don't you just put some perspective on it.  Yeah, how great it was.  Why, you're from Mastic?  How great was she?  I'm ashamed to be a Long Islander.  So am I.  Like she'd go somewhere and they'd go, where are you from?  And she'd go, oh, my God, I can't say it.  All right. 
[01:31:30]  I'm from Long Island.  Oh, ugh.  Those boys made that joke.  I can't believe it.  I'm ashamed.  You mean that place where those guys that did the radio show are from?  That did the sound effects of the horses?  Yes!  Up.  Right now.  She just blew up our spot.  We're having fun with this.  40 years.  We're having more fun now.  You friggin' fuddy-duddy.  Make a pie, brud. 
[01:32:00]  Look at Jimmy cracking himself up.  So misogynistic.  Make a pie, brud.  That covered a few areas.  I think it's funnier that he just openly laughed at his own jokes.  That's great.  Make a pie, brud.  Goddamn, Jimmy. 
[01:32:30]  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Of course it is.  That makes me very happy.  Of course it is.  It came from little Jimmy Norton.  Let's say hi to Ashley in Jersey.  Ashley.  Ashley.  Hey.  Ashley.  You're on the air, Ashley.  Yeah, I can tell.  Okay.  What's up, Ashley?  So what do you want to say?  Say that again?  What do you want to say, Ashley?  You're on the air, Ashley.  I want to say that, you know, of course it's morbid humor.  Hell, it's so funny. 
[01:33:00]  But, you know, some people are not going to like it.  But if you don't like it, we don't want to hear you, bitch.  Just turn off the radio.  That's right.  And even if you do love it.  Right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Hey, John in Boston, listening on BCN, the home of Toucher and Rich, he's got some.  John, what's up?  Hey, Lisa, man, it really makes you want to vomit, actually.  People like that are ruining this country.  You've got people getting gunned down.  Uh-oh.  Your phone's crabbing out.  But he does make a good point.  It sounds like Lisa's been listening all morning. 
[01:33:30]  She wasn't outraged when we were talking about another cop being killed in Philly.  Yeah, how about that?  There are a lot of people out there that care more about animals than human beings.  I'm assuming Lisa's one of those people.  I hope she calls back.  Can I say, by the way, just speaking of caring more about animals than people, I saw a documentary  on Virginia Newkirk.  I think it was Virginia from PETA, the Who Started PETA.  Uh-huh.  All right.  It's great.  I love her.  Really?  I love her.  Really?  Yeah.  You can't not.  Why?  She's just great.  Why?  Is she?  Yeah.  Like, because she cares so much about animals or because she's a crazy woman? 
[01:34:00]  She's both.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I got to see that then.  I love her.  She was sterilized when she was 22.  She doesn't believe in God.  Why was she sterilized?  She didn't want to pump one out.  At 22?  Or 23.  Yeah, she was right there.  Something like that.  Wow.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Where did you see this?  Went in there with a cake blender.  One of those.  Yeah, it was years ago.  Oh, boy.  Be careful, guys.  That's right.  Lisa's listening somewhere.  Because those type of people don't turn off the radio, by the way.  She's still out there listening. 
[01:34:30]  It's on In Demand on HBO.  Really?  I'm going to go check that out.  I cried through the whole thing.  I can't handle animal stuff that much.  Yeah, I can't either.  I bawled like a sissy.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Like Bob Kelly.  I know I am.  I'm that way, too, man.  I've got to be honest.  I mean, I could find the humor in a derby horse going down.  Absolutely.  But just the average animal.  What, like a chicken?  You were looking at a chicken and getting all choked up?  Turkey.  Well, I'll tell you why.  Because she's not a lot.  Choked chicken.  That's a joke, son. 
[01:35:00]  She's annoying.  She's annoying.  On some level, she is.  But then there's one point in the documentary where she's talking about why, and I got it.  Like, yeah, she's this, and yeah, she's that, but she really is for real.  But they were talking about the Butterball Turkey Factory.  Oh, boy, that must be delicious.  But just how nasty they were to the animals.  What are they supposed to do?  Frigging dress them up and take them out?  I think there's a balance between don't punch the animal in the face and violate his genitals. 
[01:35:30]  And taking him for a night in the town before you eat it.  I think there's a happy medium in there somewhere.  Do they punch him?  They were just awful.  Yeah, it's like...  What, the workers?  Yeah, it's like...  Okay, then they have these people probably are not very educated, and they have some issues,  and they treat the animals like crap.  That should obviously be taken care of.  You can't have a moron like that around.  There's no reason to punch the turkey in the face. 
[01:36:00]  So maybe they need better people there.  Unless it gobbles while you're talking.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no reason.  Hey.  If you're making a point...  Quiet, you.  Pop.  Seems like that would hurt your fist if you hit him in the beak.  But they save one of the turkeys.  Like, one of them gets out, and they kept it.  Oh, yeah.  He'd just feel bad for that dumb turkey, because it's like it was scared.  I gotta see this.  It's awful.  It's walking food.  I know.  Jimmy...  They are all just walking food.  Well, watch the damn thing and see if you've got an emotion in your body. 
[01:36:30]  I don't have emotions for things that are edible.  Yeah?  I like little kittens and puppies.  Dogs are edible in some countries.  I like seeing them get hurt.  Cats are edible in some countries.  Dogs.  What about poor Jack Jack?  You remember Jack Jack?  Yeah.  My little...  Jack Jack.  That's the reason I have a $4,000 rug underneath my cars in the garage now.  So, Jack Jack ripped up the rug.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Tried to get new rugs, and now the rug is residing underneath the Escalade and the Mustang in  the garage, because Jack Jack wrecked it.  It's a cat.  It's a cat, I know.  Hey, you like Jack Jack.  Don't turn on Jack Jack.  I liked Jack Jack.  All right.  There's a scene, real quick, there's a scene where they show people taking fur, and I've  seen how trappers do that, where they beat the animal, and they just hang it upside down,  and they rip the fur off it while it's alive.  It's the worst...  Alive?  Yeah, you saw it? 
[01:37:30]  You see it breathing after panting, and most of them are in Asian countries, and you literally,  you want to pick up a rifle and just start pumping rounds into people.  Yeah, that stuff's just reprehensible.  They rip the skin down, and the animal is alive, and they just...  Oh, God, what a nightmare that would be.  What animal?  Oh, I didn't...  I don't know.  Somebody who might...  I didn't recognize...  Supposedly, they have to do that, because if you kill them first, they release some kind  of chemical that messes up the furs.  I've only heard...  Or something like that.  I've only heard that's for food. 
[01:38:00]  Like, that's one reason they don't kill...  Like, I won't eat lobster, because they have to cook it alive.  Like, why can't they just clunk it on the dumb, prehistoric head?  Prehistoric head, huh?  I mean, it just...  It does look like it's very hot and uncomfortable.  Big bug.  Then again, they live at the bottom of the ocean with, you know, 50,000 pounds, with  their big salt water, their dumb eyes.  Life isn't exactly grand.  They get sand in their eyes all the time.  You know what?  Not only am I going to start eating lobster, but I'm going to cook them alive and then stop  halfway.  Speaking of the big lobster eyes, it just proves God has a sense of humor, because all that 
[01:38:30]  salt, like you just said, is above them, and they can't blink the salt out of them.  It's like, ow, ow.  Constantly, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Like being in a pool all the time.  Right.  And it's like, what can you see?  Ow, ow, ow.  You're at the bottom of the ocean.  You can't see anything.  What do you see, a mollusk?  A mollusk.  Oh, look, my eyes, my big eyes work.  And there's a jellyfish.  Now there's nothing.  Rob's just suck.  All right.  We're late for a break.  877-212-0108.  Got the phones lit, though.  We'll see what you guys are talking about next here.  Drew Boogie. 
[01:39:00]  What's up?  You all right, Drew?  Why are you here?  I bring gifts.  Ooh.  Gifts.  All right.  We'll see what you brought next.  I like gifts.  I got gifts, too, by the way.  For us?  For the lucky.  No.  For the lucky staff.  What?  It's called Giveaway Christmas Shirt Day.  You want to do that next?  A couple things Mother gave me for Christmas.  But God darn it, I love it.  It just won't have a chance.  And you're going to just give it to the staff? 
[01:39:30]  Van Heusen?  And they have no choice.  They've got to wear their gift tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  If they want to continue working for the Opie and Anthony show, the lovely gift that  Jim's going to give you after the break, you're going to have to wear tomorrow.  Well, I don't have enough for everybody, so they're going to have to fight for it.  Well, you're going to have to decide who gets the lucky Christmas shirt.  All right.  Hey, we're going to play this before break.  All right, guys.  I write an apology from the New York Post for his page six story about a sex case.  Involving the fiancé radio personality, Greg Opie Hughes. 
[01:40:00]  The post is now saying it was wrong when it reported that Opie's fiancé was involved  in an X-rated video with Bam Margera.  The paper now claims that there is no sex tape and the radio host's fiancé never even met  the MTV star.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Cinco.  De Mayo.  Yeah.  Whatever that's worth for, you know. 
[01:40:30]  Well, we changed our names today.  Non-Mexican people.  I'm Gregorio.  Antonio.  Antonio.  Creamy.  Creamy.  Now it's all out and you know.  Nice.  Drew Boogie in studio.  And Drew had a busy weekend working on The Sounds of Steve.  Yes, sir.  So what do you got for us today, Drew?  Well, every time Steve does some new warm-up, I get forwarded the audio and I get a burst 
[01:41:00]  of inspiration.  By the way, the Animation Festival is coming up June 5th, Roseland Ballroom.  It's a sold-out event and we're keeping all the animations under wraps.  And then after the Animation Festival, we're going to get them all out there for everybody  else that wasn't lucky enough to get a ticket for the Animation Festival.  And I'm telling you, someone took your Steve remix.  So I heard.  And made an animation. 
[01:41:30]  It's hilarious.  I want to see this.  It's going to be right up there when it's all said and done.  That's what I was thinking of when I made this, was the Animation Festival.  Oh, really?  Yeah, maybe hopefully someone will take this and do something with it.  Yeah, they just animated that.  But there's no audio from us.  It's just what you did with Steve.  And it's basically Steve getting ready for work.  And it's hilarious.  Have you seen it yet?  I haven't seen it.  I've got to see it.  You know what?  After this break, you've got to go into the office and see it and then tell us what you  think.  Oh, excellent.  Because the Animation Festival is going to be huge, man. 
[01:42:00]  We can't wait.  June 5th, Roseland Ballroom.  And we're hoping that you guys are hard at work with your animations.  You've got to get a hold of Steve and let us know that you are definitely working on  something.  So far, we've got four or five really, really good ones.  But we definitely want, obviously, a few more.  And I'm assuming people are still working on them.  So they'll let us know when they're done.  Okay.  So here's the raw audio that Steve did last week.  Oh, I know what's going on here. 
[01:42:30]  Tim is also involved with this.  I think that's Tim warming up as well.  And then I think what happened was Tim started warming up his voice and then Steve decided  to warm up his voice.  Oh, I didn't even know that.  These production people are just really strange.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Doing Indian music. 
[01:43:00]  Love this stuff.  I'm on so many meds right now.  You know what's weird?  Like, to me, that's just nonsense.  But when Drew hears stuff like that.  He hears magic.  He hears like rhythms and stuff, right?  And beats.  And actually, that's the most helpful thing Steve has said in a long time.  What, the meds part? 
[01:43:30]  No, before that.  Oh, just a little bit babble.  Well, Drew took that and came up with this.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, he's like, oh, he's like, oh, he's like. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, my God. 
[01:44:30]  Steve can sing anything.  Exactly.  Very, very nice.  Drew Boogie.  Are you promoting anything?  Not yet.  We'll have something soon.  What's wrong with you?  At the very least, you should put all this stuff on a CD.  The listeners will buy this.  Oh, yeah.  All the remixes and stuff.  They'll buy a remix CD from Drew Boogie.  I'm telling you.  You have to work on that.  Because they'll throw it on their phones and all.  They'll love that.  It's an easy sale for you, man. 
[01:45:00]  An easy five million bucks.  Or 5,000.  A little more than that.  All right.  Moving on.  Cinco de Mayo.  We got to honor another person here today.  We honored Felix Mion earlier today, even though he's Puerto Rican.  Puerto Rican.  And that doesn't really.  That's the best the boys could do down the hall.  Here is another nominee or honoree.  Honoree.  Sure.  For Cinco de Mayo.  To honor this Mexican Independence Day, we bring you the following Minuto in Mexican 
[01:45:30]  history.  Minuto is Spanish for a minute.  Ave Maria, que gran pendejo.

One flag for Steve and the gang.  You didn't like that?  Huh?  I kind of enjoyed it.  Did you like it, Jimmy?  I think the funnel meter might be off.  It was a little insensitive, I think.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  Can't be insensitive in this day and age.  No, no, no.  People don't like that.  Yeah.  They're insensitive.  All right.  Uh.  We got, um.

[01:49:00]  Are you driving to work?  I am at work right now  Alright  I just want to comment on that  Sea that called from Long Island  Oh Lisa the Sea yeah  I hate to bring it back after you guys are off the topic  I wanted to make that  Beat in a dead horse joke but somebody already beat me to it  Yeah  Yeah  If she's gonna bitch about you guys making fun of it  Like why don't I just complain about the whole sport in general  I mean it's been going on for you know I don't know how many years 
[01:49:30]  But I mean it's been a  10-20 years probably  Perhaps more than that  Well what else are you gonna do with horses?  There's a video in Seattle you may be interested in  When it comes down to it  Some of these animals  What else are you supposed to do with them?  You can't like  It's really tough to have a horse as a pet  Well you can ride them  There's those kind of jokes on Looney Tunes and stuff when you're a kid and it's hilarious  How about you just slap his face? 
[01:50:00]  What I like to do to a horse is like when it's hanging that big dumb face outside the barn  Yeah  I just like I yell at it for political reasons and slap it and get my aggression out  He looks all puzzled  Yeah  Those big eyes  You can slap 30 times and never hit the same spot twice  Big heads  My new book The Fun of Slapping a Horse Face  And the horse is never gonna put up it's dukes  He can't  Yeah he's just gonna have to take it  In case you hear this  This is the horse's way of going what's going on?  Alright Jared good point good point  Let's go to Amanda on Long Island  Amanda 
[01:50:30]  Hey  Hey Amanda  What's going on guys?  Just doing our thing you know?  That's cool  Can I have your job?  Why?  Uh oh  Sounds like our boss  I'll have your jobs  Yeah  How many times have we heard that?  I mean it differently  Why do you want our jobs?  I want to get paid to talk all day  And just say dumb stuff?  And make fun of people  Yeah that's  Yeah that is like the fun thing to do  Oh yeah cause not many people  You know what in this day and age 
[01:51:00]  Not many people get to do this  No  Just hang around and make fun of people  We realize how lucky we are to be able to do this every morning  We make fun of the weak  Yep  The underprivileged  Oh yeah  The people that  It makes us feel better about ourselves  Absolutely  We definitely make fun of people that can't fight back  Can't fight back  Yeah  It's a tough job  Yeah  You know what  Very few people can handle the rigors of this job  The rigors  Cops and firemen are sissy  Ring the bell  They have fun running out  Meeting the public  Yeah a little fire 
[01:51:30]  You put a hose on it  So  Try doing this  This is a man's job  Tough manly job  Absolutely  Alright Amanda  Alright  Thank you  There's a billboard causing some controversy  This is  Hello Bill  This is pretty good  Uh oh  What's  Pum  Pum  Pum  Whoa  Enjoy the uh  The mic Nick Carter  Sneezy mic 
[01:52:00]  Oopsie  Uh  Billboard controversy  Well some people say it's fine  While others say it's making fun of a blind person  You'll have to draw your own conclusions about the billboards on Interstate 65  They've only been up a few weeks and are already causing a buzz  I thought it was very offensive  Barbara Alk of Athens was visiting the birthplace of Helen Keller today  I can kind of see it because she was blind come see what she couldn't but I don't think there was any ill intent  Others in Tuscumbia could see how the sign could be misinterpreted 
[01:52:30]  They might not know the full history of a Scholes area you know it could come off as a joke to them  I was really upset about it because Helen Keller is one of our um you know heroes  Hero  Hero  What'd she do  Nothing but bumping the walls and knock dishes over  Yeah real hero you know how I grab from other people's plates on on the dinner table  What did she do but bruise her her shins a lot  She did nothing  She stubbed more toes than anyone else in the history of man 
[01:53:00]  The person who was training her impatient that's a hero  Yeah absolutely you know how expensive it was to have her around breaking everything in sight  Uh billboard to tour her birthplace reads yeah come see what she couldn't  That's fine makes sense she couldn't see what she couldn't  Helen Keller's birthplace is one of the largest tourist attractions here in the Scholes  Twyla Hyde just moved to the Scholes area a few years ago when she saw the billboard she thought it was insightful  It shows that we can see what she couldn't but at the same time I believe that she could see in her mind's eye 
[01:53:30]  Helen Keller's birthplace brings more than 60,000 visitors a year to the Scholes  Catchy advertising is key in bringing new tourists to the area  I didn't really have much of a reaction I knew it was an ad  She was an extremely intelligent woman and I don't believe she herself would be bothered by that  Colbert County Tourism and a Helen Keller home teamed up to create the ad  They tell us they meant no disrespect by the billboard and they just hope more people will come and visit 
[01:54:00]  Where was she born? Probably a nuclear reactor  Old bad eyes  It would have been offensive if it mentioned how she answered the waffle iron  Instead of the phone  Well you call ahead and it's an iron  It's an iron  Let's go to Daryl in Louisiana  Daryl  Or see what Helen couldn't  It's telling you to avoid potholes in the area  Hey guys  Hey Daryl  Or if it had just a picture of 
[01:54:30]  If it's at Helen Keller's house and it had like a photo of two eyes with a circle with a line through them  Oh my god  That would be offensive  Daryl what do you have?  Hey Ant this is 5'11 rep again Daryl  I'm at a  Y'all were just talking about tases  I'm at a SWAT conference  And I can probably get one of these guys to get volunteered to get tased  And call y'all so y'all can hear him getting zapped  Oh live on the air like that?  That'd be great  Can we get that done right after the break or what?  It'll probably have to be on XM 
[01:55:00]  Because the show doesn't get started for another 30 minutes  And then  But I'll check with the  Boy that's a hell of a commercial for XM right there huh?  That's pretty cool  It's crazy coming up  You're not making the bosses too happy by saying that  Well I'm sorry  But I'm sure there's going to be some cussing involved  So it might be better than that  Yeah that's true  Alright  Hey Daryl  I got your email  And boy could I use one of those little undershirt things that kind of you know you could pack 
[01:55:30]  Wait is this Daryl from 5-11?  Yeah  The 5-11 dealer?  Wait you want the whole shirt?  Yeah the tight t-shirt one  What color?  Black  What size?  Medium  You want a v-neck or a crew neck?  V-neck  Jesus Christ  Alright wait where you omissioned it?  Well we're broadcasting to a million people  I'm making an order  Hold on he'd like for the size  Do you have a large extra psychopath? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah  I got your email so I'll email you the details there  Alright  I'll call y'all back with a guy getting zapped  Thank you sir  Very nice  Alright bye bye  Alright after the break we got two more things to do  We got  I don't have enough places for your guns  What?  We got a list of sexiest film duos  It's a terrific list  And Jimmy I see is making his own list  I'm sure it's going to infuriate me  It looks like you gave up though  You only got two down  You got two  Try four bub  Four?  Alright  And also I didn't forget Jimmy  You brought in some Christmas presents 
[01:56:30]  I think I only have a couple  I'm not going to think of my hat yet  Oh a couple of shirts  So what?  You've had these shirts laying around?  No  No I've worn them many times  I actually  I folded them and put them right back in  With the plastic and the collar and everything  Sure did  And mommy gave you this for Christmas?  Oh these are terrific  And you want to now hand them out to the staff?  I do  I think the staff would love such good shirts  From just the quick glimpse I got inside that box  It doesn't seem like you 
[01:57:00]  Of course not  Especially the collar is appropriate to give away on Cinco de Mayo  Good job mom  Wow okay  We're going to do that after the break  And I know I have to move on  But I just want to do this one more time  Bear with me  But it's a very good day for me personally  And for my girl personally  There's a nice retraction in the post today on page 6  And it reads  I want to read this for the rest of the country  Because they don't get the paper  Or the post anyway  It reads 
[01:57:30]  For the record  On April 23rd  We reported that the fiancé of Greg Opie Hughes  One half of the Opie and Anthony radio show  Was involved in an X-rated sex video  With MTV star Bam Margera  When this came out  I was yelling and screaming  To say it's a vicious rumor  Started by a disgruntled employee  But no one really wanted to listen  In the media anyway  To what I had to say  Even Channel 11  They did their little retraction this morning  But they had to wait for the post  To say that it wasn't real  Which is like  Come on  Why don't you just take our word for it  We had a little info on this 
[01:58:00]  I've been harassed by an ex-employee  For at least 18 months at this point  Anyway  The post continues on page 6  Yeah  Involved in an X-rated sex video  With MTV star Bam Margera  We reported that Hughes  Was taking legal action  Against a disgruntled ex-employee  Of the radio duo  Who had acquired the rights to the video  We have since learned  That this information  Supplied by Stepping Out's  Chauncey Hayden  Was entirely incorrect  We have since learned  That this information  Supplied by Stepping Out's 
[01:58:30]  Chauncey Hayden  Was entirely incorrect  There's no sex tape  Further Hughes' fiancee  Has never met  The MTV star  The post sincerely  Regrets  The era  They rarely  Rarely  Rarely  Rarely  Do this by the way  Sincerely  And I just want to thank  The listeners  That have been supporting us  Through this  This crap  And I'll finally just stop  It's just a good day  For us though  Today  And I  I just needed to 
[01:59:00]  To say that  Okay  Very good  We'll get back to the jokes next  Oh and I've got a Lulu  Good  Opie and Anthony  On your radio dial  We gotta get to Jimmy  But first  Drew Boogie went into the office  Saw the animation of  One of the remixes you did  Unbelievable  The Steve remix  And this person animated it  And made it  Steve getting ready for his day  Where it shows him  Waking up as a bear  He is a true fan  He picked up on  Every nuance of Steve 
[01:59:30]  Just from what's talked about  On this show  It was unbelievable  He went into like  Kind of like a tornado spin  With a razor  And then became Steve  Don't give it away  Well  Yeah  You're giving it away  But I'm trying to  You know hype up  This animation festival  It was really good though  Yes  It was  It was  I can't even talk  Yeah  Yeah June 5th  At Roseland Ballroom  It's a sold out show  And we're really excited  We want to make this  An annual event  And I think it's going to be  A huge success  Get some more animations in too  Because there's a lot of money up  A lot of money  $10,000 Jimmy 
[02:00:00]  $10,000  I think we're going to add  Other stuff as well  Other prizes  And all sorts of things  I was saving it  But I'll say it now  One of my CDs  Wow  Really Jimmy  Really  That's right  People say forget about that  10 G's  I want  Jimmy's  What  That should be for me  For mentioning it  And if your animators  Want some more inspiration  Go to  MySpace.com  Slash  The Great Drew Boogie  And you can  You know 
[02:00:30]  Use some of my stuff as well  Why the Great Drew Boogie  That's what Opie called me  Before he started calling  Everybody the Great  You were the first  The Great  I think so  I'm sorry  I'm going to leave  Up your spot  I thought MySpace  Somebody might have had  The mediocre Drew Boogie  Take it  Right  And you had to go  With the Great  Jimmy are you psyched  For the ONA Traveling  Virus Comedy Tour  Of course  We were going to take  A year off  What happened  They pulled us back in  I know  What's that famous line  They dragged us back in  It's from the Godfather 3

[02:07:30]  Is something that drives  Anthony nuts  Yeah because they never get it right  Because this is like  Pretty much  Like who cares  Type radio  But  Mickey Rourke  And Kim Basinger  Who steamed up the screen  In the 1986 movie  Nine and a half weeks  Are the sexiest movie couple  Of all time  Stop it already  With the friggin food  That's the scene that  For some reason  People feel they have to say that  Is one of the hottest sex scenes  You 
[02:08:00]  They're outside of the refrigerator  And they're like  Kissing  And touching each other  And then all of a sudden  They open up the fridge  And they pull the food out  And start eating it off  Of each other  How disgusting  Is food and sex  Put together  I'm trying to think  If I've ever used food  In a sex thing  No  Why would you  I think like  Like edible panties  You try that once  And then you realize  This is  Those are goofy  It's like fruit roll up 
[02:08:30]  It's like a fruit roll up  They don't eat it  That's what you want  Yeah let me eat that  You'd be sitting there going  Puh  Puh  Puh  Puh  The whole time  All night long  Puh  Trying to floss things  Out of your teeth  Stop with the food  There's nothing sexy about it  Uh  Gonna take like  What did they take  Like condiments  And  Just mustard  Yeah  Just putting mustard  On her breast  They just emptied out the fridge 
[02:09:00]  Right in front  Yeah  It was so stupid  Oh  Like strawberries  You take out a strawberry  And slowly feed it to somebody  And then run it up and down their body  And they're supposed to go  Oh it's a strawberry  Just stop  That doesn't work  A lot of this stuff  Looks better  When you see it in movies  And then you try it out  And it's ridiculous  It's not practical  Because the next one is ridiculous too  So uh  If you want to look at this list  I don't know why you would  Go to the movie phone website  25 hottest big screen couples  At number 5 on the list 
[02:09:30]  Uh  Is a twosome  That many critics  Would place at number 1  Anthony  So there's a little controversy  With this list  Ooh  Burt Lancaster  And Deborah Kerr  In the 1953 winner  Of 8 Academy Awards  From Year to Eternity  From Year to Eternity  Yeah  The big beach scene  Trying to have sex  In water in general  Socks  They're laying on the shoreline  Right where the water comes up  Right  And they're rolling around  In the sand  Right  Making out  And the waves

[02:20:30]  What are you trying to accomplish here?  I'm trying to accomplish  To not  Well I'm trying to not be unfunny  Combined with  Very good  Yeah  No no  I'm just  You know  Just define a voice  Figure it out  And keep pushing  And inside the CD  I gotta say  It's done by  Comedy Central Records  I think right?  Yeah Roxanne designed it  Yeah it looks good  I mean  Absolutely  It's fun seeing  The stages  All these pictures of Dove  It should be called  The birth of Shanana  That is awful hair

Yeah yeah  And his dad's wearing  A white suit  Looks very gentlemanly  And Dove and his brother  Just like two fucking  Creepy little  Thugs  Not really thugs  And there's one great picture  Of Dove with a mullet  Where's that fucking mullet you have?  Oh it's fantastic  This one  It's awful  I was thrown out of high school  And that was my graduation  Which one?  I had to head back  The one where I'm accepting  A diploma from a guy  In a golf shirt  Oh I see that  Okay yeah yeah 
[02:21:30]  That was the vice principal  They allow me to come back in  And pick it up  I'm gonna go back to the picture  With you and your brother  With your dad  It looks like  He was scared of you guys  I think he didn't want us around  I don't know if it was fierce  When I was elinquent  I think  Just sort of disappointment  In general  I think Menendez  When I see this picture  I'm like  One wrong move  And dad's gonna get it  How would you feel  If you shot two loads  And that's what showed up?  Because I know Dove's brother  He turned out to be  A very good looking guy 
[02:22:00]  And Dove's a handsome dude  But these pictures  Well my brother's actually  Oh no I was gonna say  My brother's actually  He's a psychologist  But he went to Nepal  Learned to speak  Nepalese  And he also went to  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu  Submission tournaments  And he was a big swinger  Really?  Which individually  Those components  Wouldn't necessarily make  For much of a human being  But if you put them together  In the same person  It's this fucking superhero  Sure you go to a swing party  You talk to a chick  You try to wear her down  Psychologically  If that doesn't work  You rape her with Jiu Jitsu  Works out nicely 
[02:22:30]  I think we need to book  His brother for the show  He's perfect  Yeah  No no he's a piece of work  He seems like he could be a problem  Well it was next level stuff  When I found out  He called me poolside  At noon you know  And he was banging  This chick in a lawn chair  And there was a girl  Next to her also waiting  And you could see her  She was saying hurry up  And then I knew my brother  Had reached the next level  When he turned around at noon  And said don't overcook the chicken  I mean literally  I was on the phone  That's you know  Anyway  If you're that divorced  From the experience  That you're worried about the chicken  Somebody's reached the next level  That's next level shit 
[02:23:00]  That is true  I never think that  When I'm getting my dick sucked  I think oh god  This is a chicken  Don't overcook it  Don't overcook it  It defeats its own purpose  Defeats its own purpose  And he slipped the table over  He had a bite of meat  About a steak  It defeats its own purpose  Remember that  Best line  And then he goes  Do you call those carrots  Like there's a problem  With the carrots  That they don't even address  Until he's fucking yelling at them  He's talking about  Raging Bull by the way  Yeah  He's shaking his hand  Do you call those carrots  Those carrots

No I was like  Sitting in the chair  But leading off the chair  As if I was about to get down on a knee  Oh  That's just the worst 
[02:32:30]  I was like  Jess  Are you sure you're okay  With the trivia bet?  Because if you're not  And she just starts like  Laughing and crying  And covering her face  Dude  Do you realize that  To a girl  That is like  The pinnacle  Of their fucking life  That's like  That's like  That whole proposal  From the proposal  To the fucking honeymoon  And everything in between  That is what  90%  Of women  Look forward to 
[02:33:00]  Since they're kids  That's what they want  See like  I would have thought  That she would be relieved  That I don't want to get married  But apparently  I was wrong  Apparently she wants  To get married  Yeah  Or even  Just the fact that  That is  The biggest thing  In their lives  She actually like  When we were leaving  She was trying to explain  How important it was  And she was like  It would be like  If I told you  You were going to  WrestleMania  And said you couldn't go  She's got to put it  In those terms  For the simpleton  You want to hear the audio

This lady was so rude  Can I at least say  Wait wait wait  This is so rude  Before  Before we do the same bit  For the 12th time  Can I at least say this  When this story  First hit the news  You two were  Quite outraged  By the situation  I would love to hear  The tape of that  Until I realized  That fucking  Miss I have no manners  Deserved it  What happened 
[03:03:00]  When you're going to see this  There's a very  There's a lady  And she's obviously  Fucking a problem  And she's rude  And she wears her hat indoors  And a man  A man  A gentleman helped her  Remove her hat  He taught her  That you shouldn't wear a hat  Like that indoors  Absolutely  No but you  I'm going to feel bad  Are you not?

And now look at how her hair puffs out  When he clocks her  And how clumps the lychee falls  That's terrible  Look at this  Cartoon music  She's called him the n-word  And there he goes  And look at the wheel  Just going  On her walker  Oh my god  She looks like  Newt  You can't get enough for that  Jimmy can't get enough for that 
[03:05:00]  Don't help me out here  This could be  This could be  20 shows  You can't internalize  Your sense of decency  In 30 seconds  What the fuck am I gonna do?  Look at Jimmy  We've done probably  We've probably done  Two or three hours  On this video  Easily  She's so rude  She really is rude  Take that hat off  Your inside  What will you race?  Oh it's awful  She's 101  I know  She's got a walker  She's just trying  She should have learned manners

[03:06:00]  Just sit back  It'll be over soon  I'll wait it out  I know  My stomach is killing me now again  You don't want to acknowledge  When you first saw this  You were outraged  By the perpetrator  Outraged  Absolutely  I wanted him dead  Until I remembered my upbringing  And what mother told me  What happened  When one is his daughter  And then I suddenly understood  The plight of this gentleman  What mother told me  He's educating her  In the fun art of  Take off your ass 
[03:06:30]  Absolutely  When she wants to be 110  She'll have nine years  Of good manners  What the hell  All right  You can stop showing it  We can't do another  20 minutes  And bore listeners  How long ago  Did that happen  Well not long ago  Enough ago  Where we should be  Making fun of it  Yeah  Not enough time has passed  I'm trying to play  The other side  Are you sure  That wasn't shot 
[03:07:00]  In Guatemala  The day Bobby arrived  Dude  Look at my hat  Dude  I'm trying to play  The other side  Of this bit  You just  Drag me right in  And I start laughing  Just as hard  It's so hard  Not to laugh  And it's so horrible  But I don't know  What am I going to do  Don't you see the rudeness  Where's the rudeness  Because she has a hat on  And at first  With her hair  She probably put the hat on  In the elevator  Is that all right  No she didn't 
[03:07:30]  She left the apartment  He'd been watching her  I bet he'd been watching her  And he saw her  With that hat in the lobby  And he probably asked her  On other occasions  Madam  Could you remove your hat  All the doors  Oh my god  She yells out  A racial epithet  He should have given her  An uppercut  And given her  A Mary Tyler Moore moment  Where the hat goes  Straight up in the air  Who can turn the world on  With her fall  Oh god  She knew that whole song  Who can turn the world on  I do want the audio 
[03:08:00]  Of the first time  We saw that  It's a very different tone  From you guys  Yeah yeah  We were outraged  People are forgetting that  I don't know when  It turned around  And became  The funniest comedy  I've ever seen  That's an easy find  Bob Kelly's in Guatemala  And I think he's gonna  Come back tomorrow  We should have some stories  He went down there  For the weekend  To do some relic hunting  And someone just handed us  Who was it?  Travis  Because they all need credit  Eight fun facts  About Guatemala  And he said he was  Going down for  Deblooms  Deblooms 
[03:08:30]  Oh really?  He didn't even say  Deblooms  He's going to hunt  For some fucking things  He doesn't even know  What they're called  They're called books  And you're not gonna  Find them in Guatemala  What do we got?  What are some of the  Fun facts, Anne  Of Guatemala  Well, never ever  Take photos of children  Without permission  Some Guatemalans  Are extremely paranoid  About this  And assume you're  A kidnapper  So we told him  Not to do that  And I've heard  That people have  Taken pictures of kids 
[03:09:00]  And mobs form around them  And they beat the crap out of them  Can you assume you're a kidnapper  As opposed to a harmless pedophile?  Why would you be out there  Taken pictures of kids  I know, taking pictures of children  Yeah  Creep  It's dangerous to travel  Between cities after dark  Doing so significantly  Increases your risk  Of being in a car accident  Or being the victim  Of an armed robbery  It's like banditos  Walking around there  Why a car accident?  Yeah  By the way  All these fun facts  Go for anything  Above 96th Street  As well  I'm putting the back  It ain't Guatemala 
[03:09:30]  That this sheet  Necessarily pertains to  This is my favorite  Avoid gatherings  Of agitated people  Frustration over crime  And lack of appropriate  Judicial remedies  Has led to violent incidents  Of vigilantism  Including lynchings  Especially in more  Isolated rural areas  Attempting to intervene  May put you at risk  Of attacks  From the mob  Jesus Christ  People were just  Going up to angry mob  And saying  Hey what's happening  Hey calm down  Things are great  Where I'm from  What are you doing guys  Come on 
[03:10:00]  Dude  You know  We all get  Let me tell you  About when me and Dane  Got in a little tiff  Once on the bus  You gotta live your lives  Well thank god  Somebody's communicating  These fun facts  That they fucking  Stab him  And a luau  Falls out of his belly  Or is it trying to  Litch him  And tree over  After tree comes over  A luau  Falls out of his belly  Is that a whole pig  Inside of him  They have to find a redwood 
[03:10:30]  To string him up  They think he's a mythical figure  Since December 99  24 American citizens  Residents  And 6 American citizen  Tourists  Have been murdered  And suspects  Have been convicted  In only two cases  Jesus  According to  Guatemalan authorities  1,188 women and girls  Were murdered  Between 2001 and 2004  That's not a lot  Depends on the population 
[03:11:00]  You're kidding  The United Nations  Recently listed  Guatemala  There's a thousand women  Murdered here  But there's probably  What 30 million people  Well doing some quick math  A woman a day  Is getting murdered  For the most part  Give or take a few  That happens here  But there's 300 million people  That's right  They found refried beans  In her underwear Sam  It's Jim C  Jim C  Murd  He does a great  Jack Klugman  As Quincy  He does all those  Old car  I don't  Yeah 
[03:11:30]  It's old  Imitations  Yeah  Remember this show  They're esoteric  Quincy  And yeah  They were murdered  Between 2001 and 2004  1,188 women  Yeah but nobody  Nobody talks about  What they did  You know  That's a good point  Whores  Yeah  Yeah  The United Nations  Recently listed  Guatemala as the  Fifth most dangerous  Country in Latin America  With 44 homicides  For every 100,000 people  That's a lot 
[03:12:00]  What is it here  What is it here  What is it in New Orleans  Yeah  44 per 100 grand  A fan will probably  Look that up  Sure  This is good news  Of every 100 homicides  93 are left unsolved  Wow  Oh my god  That is seven  Stupid murderers  Who's a police captain  Clouseau  That sounds like  A great place  To go to  There's pages  Of warnings  You can pull off  Of anywhere  We have to go 
[03:12:30]  Backwards  Because the whole  Remove your hat  Started because  We were getting into  This paralyzed old lady  Has her 90th birthday  Right  And the footage  On TV was so  It just sucks  To get old  And I were noticing  Like they did a little  Thing in her apartment  And everything around  Her is rotting  Because she doesn't  Have enough money  To like update anything  Buy anything new  Like her chairs  And her  Everything in the apartment  Is like 50 years old  At this point  Although the upside  To getting old  Is that you know  If you're 80  You can kind of  Do whatever you want  I mean you could  Literally steal stuff  In a store 
[03:13:00]  What are they going to say  Yeah they ain't going to  Fuck with you anymore  Yeah you got to  Pay for that  Yeah  I can't hear you  I'm a veteran  Yeah alright  Let him go  We should have chipped in  As a show  And done something for her  Like  What  I can't even look at you  Like what Jimmy  Maybe got in her  Shoulder pads  So the next time  She had to be rude  And put down  She had to fall  In quite his heart  Give her boxing lessons  Sent her a trainer  They showed a picture of her  When she was 16  I guess at the beach 
[03:13:30]  Or something  She kind of looked like  Britney Spears  With darker hair  Right  She was like  Really hot  Really  And then they just  Show her now  Rotting away  Holding a telephone  With those bony  Transparent fucking  Fingers  You could see her pulse  Oh gosh  Oh  Yeah  What happens  What are you doing  Are you just farting  Over there in the corner  85 years later  Hmm  From when you're 16  Yeah  I mean  It was 85 years later  74 years later

[03:15:00]  And an NYPD officer  She was paralyzed  From the waist down  When she was struck  By a stray bullet  She says  Came from the officer's gun  Used to be sad  Now no more  It's happy  Oh yeah  She sounds so happy  Used to be sad  But  Wow  I didn't know  That even happened to her  I thought they were  Just doing like  A fun little birthday story  Or something  Right  Oh boy  Animal rights group  Calls for suspension  Of eight bells jockey 
[03:15:30]  What are they  Oh there's the dead horse  There it is  Why did they have to  Put him down  Didn't they have to  Euthanize the horse  Yeah  We did the whole bit  This morning  Two broken ankles  I didn't know what happened  Two broken ankles  Two front broken ankles  And he basically didn't win  I mean she came in second  What should you do  With a horse  That comes in second  Rewarded  You gotta make an example  Out of her  Now you gotta make an example  Yeah  Here you go  Fucking crooked feet  Take your fucking  Your fucking  No milk drinking bones  And fucking  Oh god  Hit the back of the

[03:17:00]  Bullet that left  Her paralyzed  While the mayor  Didn't apologize  For the shooting  Tomasulo says  She's glad that  A city official  Finally acknowledged  All that she's gone  Through  Why should he  Apologize for  Something that was  Done  85 fucking years ago  Right  74 years  74 years  85  No I was wrong  I don't care  74  Is that her  Virginia Newkirk  I don't know if that's her  No that's not her  No that's somebody else  She's not 90  Oh yeah yeah  She's PETA right 
[03:17:30]  Where's Danny  Danny wants us to play  This clip from  Off the Charts  Documentary  I really don't know  What this is  I'm a little confused  Dan you know  Off the Charts  No but Danny's  Coming right in  He's been very excited  About this  You have right Danny  Yeah I like  He'll find a mic  It's uh  It's from a PBS  Documentary  Oh sorry  It's from a PBS  Documentary  And apparently  What you could do  Is if you're a poet  Where you just  You know write  And I am  You can send your  Poetry into this service 
[03:18:00]  And they'll write a song  Around it  Ah  And so this is a clip  Of uh  Just a small clip  Of this documentary  Where this gentleman  Sent in some of his poetry  And paid the money  That you have to pay  And then was returned  A song  Or multiple songs rather  The service is called  Magic Keys  Yeah Magic Keys  And like you said  It'll take your poetry  And compose music around it  This is uh  We meet  Kagler  Juan Singletary  With his big hit  Non-violent  Taekwondo Troopers  Yeah  Oh boy 
[03:18:30]  I'm trying to find more  Of this documentary  Hopefully there's more  Stuff like this  Is this a joke  Or is it real  No this is 100% real  When I first saw the ad  Talking about money making  And it said  Song  Get your poetry  Made in the song  Oh  This is interesting  It was $299  All together  Here's a nice speaking voice  I spent $100  In the first month  $100 in the second month  And $99 in the third month  Did he bite his tongue?  Yes  I think it was worth it  Asshole 
[03:19:00]  Within the city of southern tears  I am sitting on my super  Bicycle  And jewelry  And I'm dressed  Like Captain Bicycle  When I first heard the song  I'll surprise  Because I like thinking  I wrote that  I'll surprise but real happy  Oh god  This guy's just out of his mind  At the same time  Yeah he's retarded  Yeah  What's the deal Danny? 
[03:19:30]  Somebody's retarded or something  He's not  I don't think he's retarded  He might be a little  Like learning disabled  Or just like slow  But he's not retarded  Like retarded  I think he lives with his mom  Like his mom is in a later clip  And  But you know  Like he's a little creepy  But nothing about him  Strikes me as like  You know  Like  Mentally disabled  Nothing about him  Except for everything he said  His voice  So you send the poetry  And they come back  With a song  And you get  Well that was 300 bucks  That he spent on that 
[03:20:00]  On that particular one  Well worth it  He talks about  What he writes about  Who sings this song? 
[03:20:30]  The service?  The service thing  The subjects I write about are  Martial arts  Ladies  Angry versions  Why don't you just write about stuff you know  Like not getting tail  And being a fucking lunatic  And science fiction  Or losing to Buster Douglas in 1990  Fucking lisping idiots  What a goon 
[03:21:00]  And I guess he got a lot of his poetry  Sung by the service  Because he's got a song about Annie Oakley  Yeah this is the second  And only song  And only other song  That was I guess in this documentary  That he did  But I have a feeling he's done more  Than just these two songs  Let's hope  Where the fuck is this documentary?  It's PBS  Ugh  Annie Oakley was a lady  And a large woman  Annie Oakley is deceased  But not forgotten  What I heard 
[03:21:30]  Annie was not rock  With the help of Christ  Annie was  Rifle  The song was about  What I thought about Annie Oakley  We know  And how great I thought she was  Annie Oakley  And the romantic interest  I had  Have in her  He's got a romantic  This guy's jerking off  To a chair  With a pistol  Annie Oakley  You can't even get a picture  He's got a romantic interest  Veronica and Betty  I got cock-blocked  By Big Ethel 
[03:22:00]  Fucking idiot  Fucking jacking off  To paintings  Annie Oakley  What did Annie Oakley look like?  Spirit  Probably a big dyke  Yeah  That's all over her spirit  Shit, a mullet  What are the odds  That a hot chick  Would be that good  Of a shot  In the first place?  Yeah  Really?  Can you shoot a quarter  From a hundred yards?  How do you look like that?  However  If Annie  Jempted me  On a carriage  I might lose  To Miss Oakley  It's not funny 
[03:22:30]  Holy shit, Jim  Annie is one of my  So funny  God damn it  Wait, what was the line after  Is Jimmy Farting?  I couldn't  It snuck out  I'm scared  It snuck  It gets nervous when  When people sing about it  Annie Oakley  God damn it  Annie Oakley  That's a really bad song  Yes  Just getting some fear out  Can we send that service  Like lyrics of Mr. Hands  Or remove your hat  Yeah  Remove your hat  After this bit was played 
[03:23:00]  We should probably  Try to come up with  300 bucks  And some terrible lyrics  And we'll do something  Like yeah  Remove your hat  That's a great idea  I can't have sex  With Annie Oakley  So I'll have sex  With Charles Oakley  We need a  Remove your hat song  That would be  That would be funny  Alright, we'll work on some  He perseverates  You know  He pursues  Certain subjects  That fascinate him  Long after  It's appropriate 
[03:23:30]  For him to  Be talking about them  Or pursuing them  You know  And so he has  This focus  This concentration  And one of the  Areas  Is  Firearms  Not a violent person  But  There was a fascination  And I think  A lot of young men  Go through that  And needs to be channeled  In a  Non-violent  Way  That's bad 
[03:24:00]  In the service  There was like  Different genres of music  That you could pick  Merle Haggard  Just shot himself  Yeah  Like you could pick  Country or pop  Or funk  Or R&B  And stuff  And they'll write  The song out for you  We need a  Remove your hat song  I agree  In two different genres  Yeah  We should have it like  In country 
[03:24:30]  Definitely  In country  And then heavy metal  Or something  Well pop is funny  Pop  Yeah  It's so happy  And upbeat  Wasn't there a list  That came out  The top 25 worst  Heavy metal bands  Didn't I see that today  Who's on that list  Thank you Danny  Y'all  We got the  Dov Davidoff  In studio  Going to Indiana  After this  To promote his CD  The point is  Yes sir  Thank you  I need some  All the way  May lyrics  Hey  That's true  Hey  Haven't done that in a while  The way May

[03:25:30]  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  He loves to take Steve's sounds  Oh, my God. 
[03:26:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Gut-busting, ab-crunching.  Boy, how bad can he get?  Have you seen a man eat his own head?  Yes.  Now you'll get used to it.  Anthony spent $300 on fags. 
[03:26:30]  Ass-clown.  Anthony.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  This is the illegal.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You guys suck.  All that talk is crazy.  Hangin' with Dub David Off.  What's up?  The point is, is the CD that's out there. 
[03:27:00]  You guys should check it out.  Can you get it online, Dub?  Oh, you can buy it.  Whoa, what happened?  What was this?  I got an issue with the mic.  You can buy it anywhere.  Yeah, it's Comedy Central Records, so you can get it on Amazon, iTunes.  But get the whole CD.  I mean, if you're going to buy it, get it.  It's because it's a cool design.  Roxanne's design.  Oh, you guys don't know Roxanne.  No, is she good?  No, no, Roxanne was...  Yeah, she's wonderful.  Roxanne's my ex-girlfriend, who I still love, by the way.  I met her when she came to see Jimmy.  She's a huge ONA fan. 
[03:27:30]  Was that that long ago?  Oh, my God.  Wait, you're not with Roxanne anymore?  Yeah, it was that long ago.  She broke up with me.  How long ago?  On Thanksgiving.  Right before Thanksgiving.  Sorry to hear that.  Yeah, no, no, but, you know, I mean, I don't know.  Yeah.  We were having a little chat about it in the shitter.  Oh, relationship?  I don't know.  Yeah, the relationship thing.  It's maddening.  You know, when you hear a guy like Van Gogh cut off his ear, and people are like, how could  you do that?  I don't know.  Why are more people not walking around with their fucking ears cut off?  I mean, it's just maddening. 
[03:28:00]  That's why a crime of passion is a legitimate defense strategy in a court of law, right?  I mean, like, you do some shit that you never otherwise would have done during the course  of a relationship, because it makes you that fucking crazy.  Prosecutors are like, did you not kill your wife?  She wouldn't shut the fuck up.  Wow.  What happened?  Do you want to share?  What happened?  I could talk about it.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't, yeah.  I mean, when I was in the shrink, it was like, you have to make active steps if you want  to maintain this relationship, and it didn't come organically to me.  That's what I heard.  The fucking shrink thing again. 
[03:28:30]  I don't believe in couples counseling.  Yeah?  Sorry.  No, I think it could help some people.  I think for some people it works.  At that point, I'm like, there's too many problems.  Just go find someone new.  But if two damaged people, this is why I disagree with you, because if two damaged people, like,  I'm a problem in every relationship.  Every, I'm a fucked up, every, I know it's hard to imagine.  Yeah.  So, like, if two damaged people who do love each other, it's almost like if you bring  in so much baggage that you're always doing the same shit, it's like you could be fucking 
[03:29:00]  up a good thing by doing shit that you don't even know you're doing.  You also increase the probability of sustaining some sort of relationship scenario if you choose  somebody who has grown up with some, you know, sense of, with some real love, some  sort of confidence in themselves, because then they don't respond to situations in this  reactionary, whacked out, stripper-like way.  You know?  Exactly.  Yeah.  I mean, I know, really.  I mean, that's why, like, if you meet somebody who can make things, nice people make things.  You've never been out with a stripper and you're like, nah, I want a more coke, but  if you've got some yarn, I'll knit you a mitten. 
[03:29:30]  Nice people make things.  It's not the true and free way to look at it, man.  No, really, but if they grow up with love, I mean, I feel like, I mean, I don't know,  for me, it's like the ability to compromise is really different.  Last time I said yes to some shit I didn't want to do, I ended up in, like, the middle  of a lake in a two-person paddle boat, you know?  And I feel my soul atrophying as I paddle.  I think I heard a duck yell, faggot.  Was there an incident?  There were a number of incidents.  I don't know that there was one.  It was more just a cumulative kind of response to a scenario that she didn't feel. 
[03:30:00]  After we broke up, I was like, well, why didn't you seem more upset?  She was like, well, you know, you didn't organically, you didn't hang out with my friends.  We didn't make a lot of eye contact.  We didn't have a great sex.  I mean, what the fuck was I staying in it for?  I'm like, yeah, you got a reasonable point.  I mean, but I love it, and that's the maddening part.  It's like, you're here with this human being.  Shut up.  You guys had a nice connection.  What's that?  You guys had a nice connection.  I thought you guys were banging all the time.  You had a nice connection.  How the hell would you know?  You would always talk about it.  You would always say it.  You guys seem very good together. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, no.  Roxanne was wonderful.  Yeah, because she's a wonderful human being, and she deserves better than me.  But at the same time, it's like, I don't know.  No, but it didn't come organically, you know?  But that's the ironic part of love, I guess.  I mean, I don't want to get too Freudian, but it's like, you know, the fact that you could  really care about somebody, want to be with them, and they seem like an ideal candidate  for a sustainable relationship, yet you're not organically involved in it.  It's a fucking, it's maddening.  It's a conundrum, Anthony.  It is a conundrum.  I don't know.  I got the old, I don't think I was attentive enough. 
[03:31:00]  That is common.  I wasn't attentive enough.  And, you know, my job was all-consuming.  And then there was this kind of overall resentment that my job was the most important thing in  my life, which it is, it isn't, but it gives me the ability to do the things that are important  to me.  So it kind of gets pushed up to the top.  I have to wake up every morning.  I have to be here and do this.  Hallelujah.  Lula.  Hallelujah. 
[03:31:30]  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah, brother.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  I had the same, but then it's about the moderating part of it.  Like a personality dysfunction.  Like it's always a matter of degrees, right?  I mean, if you're so self-involved that it's narcissistic and you don't seem like you  are.  Not at all.  Right.  Then somebody's got to deal with it.  And nailed it though.  Because you're like, how do you think we pay for all this shit?  It's not.  But then there'll even be a card thrown at you sometimes where it's not the money.  It's not the material things. 
[03:32:00]  It's not.  You know, I could live in a log cabin with you.  And so he's like, no, you know something?  No, we couldn't.  No, we couldn't.  You'd be fucking.  Believe me.  I've been in enough relationships where I couldn't pay for fucking chewing gum.  Yeah.  And they don't last very long.  Yeah.  Money becomes quite a fucking issue very quickly.  It'll become an issue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if you're living in a log cabin, that's going to become an issue.  Yeah.  That's definitely going to become an issue.  Where are we going tonight?  To the birch tree.  Yeah.  That becomes a real issue.  So that's like an issue. 
[03:32:30]  And then there are just things like, and it kind of just like fizzled out.  But like you said, you know, I looked and I was like, you know, I didn't say it, but  I was thinking, eh, she doesn't seem very upset about this whole thing.  Just kind of, you know.  I know.  But now I find myself, and then it's like you're excited about being single, but then  that loneliness factor kicks in.  You know, it's the whole border lonely.  But at the same time, it's like, now I'm, you know, trying to fuck some 21-year-old stripper  who's drunk.  Like, you know, some girl at the show. 
[03:33:00]  And it's not going to be some self-possessed, dignified woman that's attracted to me.  It's going to be some chick that hates herself enough to get in my Camaro.  I don't even have a Camaro.  But the point is, if it's some 22-year-old chick you're talking to, and then you can't  communicate because it's a drunk 21-year-old girl.  And it's, well, I don't even know what this is.  It's like a helicopter that's landing in the distance all year.  And then you make out a word, you know.  It's like religion.  The American Idol.  Shut up.  Anthony can teach you how to communicate with 21-year-olds.  I got it glazed over. 
[03:33:30]  Look at mine.  She's like, are you too old for me?  I was like, am I too old to put this in there?  No.  Am I told to pretend I give a fuck about what's going on here?  Yeah.  Moses old.  I'm King Tut old for this shit.  We could do this in a fucking pyramid.  I'm really old for this.  By the way, you can't spin it.  Look who woke up.  There's no way to spin it.  Look who woke up.  There's no way to spin it and make sounding fucking a 21-year-old stripper sound shitty.  Like, you mean you can't talk?  God, gee whiz.  But he's also looking for some kind of relationship that you can kind of, like, nurture. 
[03:34:00]  Look at this.  You're jumping the microphone apart.  I get excited.  No, but then you get him back.  I don't know.  It's like, you don't communicate the truth.  You're fucking killing it.  No, no, no.  You have to keep going.  It's just that, you know, you get him back and it's like, you know what's going on.  You just saw the act.  I mean, it's fucking, and then why don't we, there was one chick pulls back and goes,  why don't we just be friends?  I was like, what the fuck are you two?  Well, first of all, you're wearing glitter.  What do you mean, why don't we just be friends?  We see the world so dramatically differently.  There is no point at which we can meet and be friends. 
[03:34:30]  That's like pulling to a gas station.  Like, could you fill it up?  Guys, like, we don't have any gas.  I'm like, why don't we be friends, man?  Tell your mom I said hi.  And then, no, really?  I got my finger in her.  She pulls back.  She goes, did you just assume we were going to do something?  It's like, we're halfway into a bottle of vodka.  Oh, my God.  I had my hand on your ass for an hour and a half at the club.  Did I assume?  Yeah, I assume.  You know, you can assume things.  If a guy's wearing a pointy white hood and a sheet,  you can assume he ain't voting for Barack.  You can assume things about people.  Look, I can do radio, but every now and then I get, Jimmy is, anyway. 
[03:35:00]  Wow, that's too fucking real.  That is too real.  Holy shit.  I thought I was unique for a minute.  I thought I was a unique and special individual.  A very dear friend of mine once said,  Jim, they're all cunts, including my mother and the Virgin Mary.  An older Scottish man told me that.  An elderly Scottish man.  A sober man in a Coors Light shirt.  A very good guy. 
[03:35:30]  I got that.  You're older Scottish.  Liam Neeson told you that?  They're all cunts, Jim.  I got the dump in Atlantic City.  Really?  In Atlantic City.  Saw it coming, you know, beforehand.  Yeah.  But didn't know the exact date.  You don't seem like you were really motivated to make it work.  No, at the beginning I was.  I was trying, but it didn't seem like, you know, and to be fair, I guess, you know,  maybe that was the case, but I really thought I was giving it a whirl. 
[03:36:00]  You went through the make it work stage.  But I mean, yeah, the make it work stage with, you know, going to see her therapist  to see if we could, you know, figure out what the problem is.  But then it was just like, I don't know.  All right.  They say that I have like this where I'm not really so involved in what she wants to do  in her life.  So I'm like, all right, I'll try to be more so.  And I made a concerted effort to try to, but then we'd end up back in the office.  And again, it was like, well, you're not being attentive.  It's like, no, no, now I'm getting pissed because no, I am. 
[03:36:30]  I tried.  It's mad.  I really fucking did give it an effort.  And he did because for Christmas he flew out to Colorado and he stayed in that hotel  very close to her family's house.  All right, look, I can't take kids.  I can't fucking take kids running around being old yelling and shit.  I'm on vacation.  I wake up at 4.15 every day.  I don't need kids like waking me up at 4.15 on vacation.  When that whole story went down on our show, I'm like, it's just a matter of time at this  point I do.  Was that like a clincher? 
[03:37:00]  But, Job, listen to this.  I'm like, how do you get that?  Well, my mom's an analyst and my brother's a choice too.  I'm like, how did he get this done?  He was able to talk his girl into saying, look, I'm going to go spend Christmas with your  family in Colorado.  Absolutely.  But he was able to work at where he could stay in a hotel while she stayed with the family.  I thought that was brilliant.  Because to stay at the house, you have to stay at the house because it's Christmas and  the kids are there and they want to see you and you haven't been there in a while.  So, you know, there's a guest room, so stay in the house. 
[03:37:30]  But I'm like, I can't fucking do this.  I know there's a hotel down the road.  I'm just surprised you were able to convince her that you were able to do it.  I wasn't able to.  Okay.  The therapist was.  Oh, really?  Because I told the therapist, because I go, I said, I'm going to be miserable going to  Colorado because it's my vacation and I just, I need sleep.  Right.  I need sleep.  It has nothing to do with the people or anything.  I just need fucking sleep.  Oh, um.  Nothing about the people.  And then she's like, why don't you?  No, it wasn't.  No, it really wasn't.  Not that side.  Believe me, the other one.  For a moment, I'm sorry.  The fucking mother? 
[03:38:00]  She could go fucking fuck herself.  Oh, God.  Yeah, but you didn't enjoy being around the kids, right?  No, no.  I didn't mind being around the kids at all.  It wasn't a problem.  But when they come barging and knocking on your door at five in the morning when I'm on  vacation, I wake up every fucking day at an ungodly hour.  I'm on vacation.  I want noon.  I want to be able to get up, throw my fucking clothes around and have some fucking Mexican  pick it up.  But was that an issue for her?  Did she not understand this? 
[03:38:30]  I mean, to the degree that you saw.  Yes!  That was an issue.  It was like, no, why don't you stay at the house?  So the therapist was like, no, let him.  Why aren't you giving him this freedom?  He's saying he'll be there.  He'll be there on Christmas and everything.  But he needs time to get away from the whole thing.  I mean, it sounds like you weren't that unhealthy.  If you were able to sustain this for eight years, chances are you can't be that big of a  lunatic.  I mean, unless, you know, you guys had complimentary sicknesses, which is what my brother  told me.  It might be.  I don't know.  Complimentary sicknesses.  But it got to the point, though, where the big breakup was in Atlantic City, and I'm  playing blackjack, and I'm playing, I'm in the fucking, like, heavy hitter section. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  And this waitress was walking around, and it was one of the Borgata babes, and they're  just fucking smoking.  Yeah, it's a hot scene.  So my girlfriend's there, and she knows I'm a smart ass.  I joke around.  I'm not serious with the girls that walk by and stuff.  But this girl was like, really?  I told her, I go, look, you can't come around here.  You're disturbingly attractive. 
[03:39:30]  Yes.  And it's, get, you're fucking my game up.  Walk away.  Walk away, you animal.  And then my girlfriend got mad at that.  What'd she say?  And she was like, she was like, what, you gotta say that to her?  It was just something.  I can't remember.  But that was like the straw.  But I think it was, not think, it was a lot more before that.  Yeah.  And then it kind of ended up just, you know, she goes, I'm leaving.  Yeah.  I go, what, where are you, back to the room?  Yeah.  Uh, home, uh, she goes, no, like you're leaving can mean a few things when you're at Atlantic 
[03:40:00]  City.  So she goes, no, I'm getting a U-Haul and I'm getting my stuff and I'm leaving.  I was like, no shit.  Okay.  Uh, that seems like an odd way to do it.  Yeah.  That's what, that's what I thought.  I mean, if that's the straw that broke the camel's back, that seems like, I mean, obviously  a lot led up to that, but that seems like a, uh, that seems strange.  They all want the fucking life.  They all want a comfortable life.  There's all women.  They all want a comfortable life.  They all want these great things.  They hate guys that don't work.  They hate guys that don't make money.  And because it's a job that requires us to get up very early, they fucking bitch because 
[03:40:30]  we can't go out and hang with their stupid friends.  I believe that was a big issue with me not going out because you never want to go out  and do anything or go anywhere.  I go, I can't, I go, I can't fucking go out on a Wednesday night to go party like a  fucking animal, uh, at some bar.  Well, you, you, you logistically actually can't.  No, you can't.  I can't.  And I still didn't do it.  4.30 in the morning.  And as well, you shouldn't have.  I still wouldn't do it.  You shouldn't have.  Good for you.  Well, seriously. 
[03:41:00]  And they all want a guy who takes good care of them.  And, uh, you were a good boyfriend.  You didn't fuck other girls.  I know.  Yeah, but we all, but you guys have to take responsibility for something.  We all want to be connected and then we can't really be connected and they don't find  it fulfilling.  And, uh, you know, I mean, we, we have complimentary sicknesses to some degree.  It's not just them.  Yes and no, but we don't, but we don't compliment your bank accounts.  Yeah.  The bottom line is this.  Right.  Fucking, not that it's money is everything.  You're right.  But they, they, they just, women are very bizarre when they complain about your job.  It's like, you know what? 
[03:41:30]  Fucking shut your face.  You understand that I have to fucking do this.  Sounds like you're going into this thing with an open mind and open heart.  I mean, why wouldn't that, why wouldn't you get along with this?  I don't want to hear it.  With anyone.  Yeah.  I don't want to hear it when it comes to work.  I don't want to fucking hear it.  Yeah.  There shouldn't be a fucking argument.  This is my career.  This is what I'm, it's not the money and materialistic thing.  The money is the fuel that runs the other shit.  Right.  Like to make you happy.  Right.  Like it's not like, wow, you got money.  I'm happy because you got money.  Because there are a lot of scumbag guys out there with money that'll treat you like fucking shit. 
[03:42:00]  Sure, sure, sure.  Case in point.  Money is the fucking, look at Jimmy Norton.  Money is the fucking fuel that drives the happy boat to fucking places like Burberry and fucking Tiffany and things like that.  That's, that's what allows that lifestyle.  That's right.  Asante.  Asante.  Asante.  J.C. Penney's line of Italian wear.  Dove.  He didn't mention, but he's a lot happier since that all went down. 
[03:42:30]  Are you?  Do you feel, do you feel?  I think Anthony would have stayed, he would have stayed in that relationship probably for, he's, he's, I'm one of those guys.  I would have stayed another year.  I'm one of those guys.  No problem.  I'm the same way.  She made the move and I think secretly, I can't speak for him, but I think secretly he wanted that type of situation to happen way before it did.  It would manifest itself in her not being able to take it anymore.  It was one of those things where, I got his hands all over some blackjack waitress, his ass at the book out.  Yeah.  All over her ass.  Do you think she regrets it, aunt?  The blackjack waitress? 
[03:43:00]  Yes.  Yes.  I don't know.  I, I can't really tell.  I don't communicate much with exes ever.  I'm sure she would.  She communicated more with her than I think any other exes.  I mean, it's fine.  But I don't, you know something?  I don't fucking know.  Of course she did.  And like you were saying before, I'm happy, but you know, there are those days where you're like,  ah, I'm fucking in bed, I'm going to watch any movie I want, I can do this.  But that's what's so maddening.  And then sometimes you're just sitting there going like, right.  Boy, this house is big and empty.  Right.  So long with a 20 year old.  Yeah, but how long does that last? 
[03:43:30]  Fucking three minutes if it's my house.  Exactly.  No, but even if you last a long time, if you do an hour and a half, it's like now you're  sitting there with you, trying to have a conversation with somebody you can't possibly talk to.  And then you dump your load.  You're like, oh God, thank God.  No one's here to bother me.  That's right.  I don't have to be nice to you.  Fucking beat it, Craigslist.  Take your fucking pittance of cash and hit the bricks.  Scram.  Out.  Oh, that's funny.  It's a good time, but then you're back to feeling alone in the world.  Did you want out of your relationship before it went down? 
[03:44:00]  No, but I, I, I, I didn't want it in it badly enough for her.  Right.  To feel as though she was in a fulfilling, connected scenario.  Bingo.  And, and she felt, and she didn't feel like, you know, it just, it wasn't, it wasn't fulfilling.  Did you cry when she left?  Uh, shut up.  Did you?  That's a yes.  No, no, no, no.  I know.  Listen, I did.  I didn't, no, I didn't cry initially.  I had some, I had some, it was a manifestation of some emotion.  It was a light liquid.  You get your, I wasn't bawling.  You just get your nostalgic moments every so often, especially if you've been in a relationship 
[03:44:30]  for a while.  Yeah.  And then you just fucking like, what are you, an asshole?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just get sick of yourself.  Yeah.  Stop it.  But if anything fucking, if there's anything around the house that makes me for a second  feel nostalgic, it goes right into the fucking paper shredder.  I swear to you.  Wait.  I had to turn over pictures.  Yeah.  What?  I'm a witness to that because I called Anthony early on.  How do you shred a bed, by the way?  I called Anthony early on in this whole breakup thing.  Yeah.  And I just heard the shred, I'm like, what are you doing? 
[03:45:00]  He's like, I'm shredding everything.  Are you shredding shit?  He went through a night of shredding.  I won't shred pictures just because they're kind of historic, the documents.  That's almost like book burning to me.  How about letters?  Letters go.  I save everything.  No.  Shit like that.  Letters go.  Letters go.  Letters go.  You're the opposite of John Adams.  Cards.  Fucking cards.  Your cards have to go.  Sweetheart.  You're the...  Shred that fucking thing.  Anything with a rainbow on it.  Yeah.  Fuck that. 
[03:45:30]  It's gone.  But a picture, certain pictures, I think I did.  Shred or deleted.  Off a computer.  Things like that.  Like unnecessary.  Not these fucking, you know, world changing photos or anything.  It's just, it's this goofy picture.  But it's fucking frightening, man.  Because when you're with somebody that you love, I'm just worried I'm going to turn  into that guy.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, I'm worried 10 years from now, I'm going to see her on the other side of the  street.  And she's smiling.  Like, had I been able to make it work, I could have been that part.  Like, she's going to be on that side, smiling. 
[03:46:00]  Right.  The sun is shining with her husband and kids.  They're eating ice cream.  And I'm on this side of the street, you know, and it's raining and dark.  You know?  And I have an open silk shirt with a gold medallion.  And I'm trying to convince some stripper that Jimmy just turned down to get in my car  because I got good blow.  You know what I mean?  I don't want to be that fucking guy.  Terrible life.  You have to fuck the stripper.  You don't get to smell the lactose farts in the ice cream when you're the little dog  shit kids fucking waking you up.  How terrible is that?  The ice cream must be so fun on a Sunday. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, a lot of guys want to blow a load and sleep, but you get to get up and take the tots  out for Haagen-Dazs.  That's true.  It fucking stinks.  You know what?  The guy that she's with?  Yeah.  That ain't sun shining on his head.  He's looking at you in the sunny fucking day.  It's pouring on his head.  They're well lit because a nuclear bomb has gone all over his head mercifully for him.  Oh, you got a fucking load on the front of your awful slacks.  It's such a weird situation, though, because you do go through those moments, these moments 
[03:47:00]  where you're like, was it good?  Did I want to be in a relationship?  Do I want to be?  You know, you walk around the lonely house.  Chaz gave me a speech about joy and happiness, you know?  He was giving me a speech about joy and happiness, you know?  You know, I'm out there.  I know.  Of course, just want to hear him say it.  No, no, but it was about joy and happiness.  It was just about making those choices that inevitably, whatever choice you make, there's going  to be downside.  You do an overall cost-benefit analysis.  Did he tell you to do the door lock test?  What? 
[03:47:30]  The door lock test.  Shut up.  It's just carjacking.  It's just carjacking, and they open her door, hit the gas, and let them take it.  That's the door lock test.  They grab her on the hand.  Unbuckle your belt, bitch.  Beat it.  Anthony, there's something odd about being in relationships, where when you're in them,  especially for a longer period of time, you just become complacent, I guess, and you  don't, it becomes, I don't want to say rut, but it's very rut-ish.  And it seems like, maybe the one thing that helps sustain, yeah, no, it's definitely rut-ish. 
[03:48:00]  Way to not say rut-ish.  It's rut-ish.  Way to avoid rut.  Yes.  Input-ish.  Gutter, with different letters.  Probably kids, though.  Ed, Ed, the ability to sustain it only because it's no, the emphasis is no longer on yourself.  It's a mutual responsibility.  I think that sucks because then you are no longer the important people in each other's  lives.  That's right.  You're there for these fucking kids.  You're there to facilitate the raising of children.  I've heard whoever told me this, though, but your replacements, you're fucking there 
[03:48:30]  to care for your replacements on the planet.  Your replacements, yeah.  And I don't know, I've never been into fucking kids.  I've never wanted to have them.  Nope.  I don't, I feel it ruins the life I kind of want to have until I can't do it anymore.  That was a point of contention with us as well.  It wasn't with her?  Was that part of it as well?  No, no.  She didn't want to have kids either.  Really?  Where'd you find her?  Yeah, I know.  That was a good feature, believe me.  But it's one of those things where you can just pick up and fucking go somewhere and 
[03:49:00]  not have, did you get the pack and play?  Oh, you got to pack like you're going to the top of K2 every time you leave the house  and you want to take a fucking kid to Starbucks.  Anything.  Did you get the bottle?  Did you get the bag?  Did you get shut up?  There's nothing worse.  You get a job.  You pull into a fucking parking lot and there's no spots.  You see a woman with two kids in her hands gets to her car and you're like, all right,  let me, you think for a second, maybe I'll get lucky and this won't take eight hours for  her to back out.  Bags and bags. 
[03:49:30]  This, she's strapping them in car seats.  She's fucking bagged.  And for what?  For what?  So that, you know, five years from that point, you get to work and you'll get a call from  your wife and she says, you know, honey, he just took his first step.  Yeah?  Hopefully it was into a fucking taxi.  Get him out.  Especially if it's five years later.  How dumb is this fucking kid?  With old, atrophied legs.  It was part boy, part turp.  When did I speak there first, too?  Never wanted that.  Never wanted the kid thing or anything.  I was going to get into the kids. 
[03:50:00]  But I do agree with you that I think that does hold people together.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously people said, oh, we stay together because of the kids.  Just like, almost genetically, I would imagine it would kick in.  Yeah.  Who was the guy who did two different evolutionary theories?  Dr. Philip Rushton of the University of Western Ontario.  But anyway.  What did Dr. Rushton say?  No, this was something that Nataman was saying.  I don't know if it was some sort of racial theory.  I walked in with my female friend the other night, and he goes, who's your friend? 
[03:50:30]  To her.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  Hold on, rapist.  Who's your friend?  Way to ask.  Nataman came up.  Does people know Nataman?  He's sort of like a Woody Allen-y character.  Yeah, he's been on.  But Nataman came out to L.A.  Woody Allen and Richard Speck.  It's done shit to me.  Oh, these guys have never heard the Nataman story.  No.  They don't know.  Nataman keeps going.  Wait, tell the story, the one we haven't heard.  Well, no, Nataman keeps going.  This was a few years ago.  He goes, I need a piece of tail.  I want some tail.  Like that, you know? 
[03:51:00]  And so finally, I get these two chicks.  One of them is crazy enough to actually, I got opposing couches.  I get him up to my apartment with Nataman.  He comes up, and I see him, and he keeps telling me.  He's going to bang.  He wants some tail.  I'm on the opposing couch, and Nataman looks at me.  And he's got the girl.  His girl starts to put her hand on his thigh, on his upper thigh.  And I look down at Nataman's hand, and he's dug it into the side of the armrest on the couch.  Like a cat trying not to fall out of a tree.  And his eyes are wheeled back in his head like an Arabian quarter horse and free raid about to be roped by an Indian. 
[03:51:30]  And I get up, and I got my piece out.  And I pull it out, you know, because I'm about to go bang.  And I get up, and I go, Dan, are you okay?  And Dan just looks at me and goes, this is not my scene, man.  Gets up, walks into the fucking bathroom.  He's a funny guy.  That's fucked up.  It's fucked up.  No, but he's so, but then he's so like, I don't know if he necessarily sees himself as the world sees him. 
[03:52:00]  He was horrified.  He showed up.  I was doing that show in L.A.  He shows up at the trail.  He's awkward.  He shows up, knocks on the door.  I haven't seen him in two years.  Didn't even say hi.  He just goes, where's craft service?  And he's wearing volleyball shades and a shirt with the rings around Saturn on it and a slim jean and a side-buckled pilgrim shoe.  And he says to me, he goes, I come out to fill the L.A. pilot season.  I get one audition.  One audition.  He goes, I walk in the room.  Bunch of nerds.  Bunch of nerds.  He was shocked that it wasn't Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro. 
[03:52:30]  He was horrified that they were sending him out on parts that weren't the romantic lead, you know?  Bunch of nerds.  Bunch of nerds in this room.  That is really funny.  That is funny.  Natterman.  Who's your friend?  He's a classic.  We love Natterman.  We just don't know what to do with him on the radio yet.  He hasn't come into his own yet.  He hasn't come into his own on the show yet.  He's very funny.  He just doesn't talk about it.  He's really funny.  When me and Dan, sometimes we wheel back and forth. 
[03:53:00]  Dan's a close friend of mine.  He'd be pretty, yeah, me.  Yeah, these guys are good together.  Yeah, no, I, but.  But Dan is, yeah, I know, but that's.  We don't know what his button is.  We're trying to find that area where, like you today.  I'm sure it's a trigger for like.  We went relationship and you went bam for the last half hour.  We haven't found that button with him yet.  Mention rape or dismembering.  Button.  One word, shovel.  Yeah.  Sawing techniques to get through the tendon.  Hey, you got it.  Yeah, he's got through the tendon.  No, no.  Now, relationships are interesting for him. 
[03:53:30]  You know, I mean, he's, he's.  I mean, and he talked about this, so I don't think I'm speaking out of school, but he's  never been in a relationship ever.  Not for a day.  His whole life.  He used to creep my girl out at the comedy cellar.  He just has a way of looking at women.  You're like, dude, man.  What the hell?  Oh, same way fucking that guy looks at Uma Thurman.  Right.  A fucking ghoul.  In a bush.  Speaking of this, there's the creep on TV right now.  I just said that.  What's his name?  His big backpack.  Johnson.  Uma Thurman's stalker trial may go to jury today.  All right.  Should we do line of the day or what?  Sure. 
[03:54:00]  Is it that time?  Bad gas, guys.  Oh, boy.  We got to hang out with like salespeople today, Aunt and I.  Yuck.  Exactly.  I hate that shit.  They talked Bob into getting us to do this dumb thing today.  That's because there's going to be a big wig there.  Who?  A couple of big wigs.  Yeah.  The biggest of the big wigs.  Yep.  And then radio big wig.  Yep.  And we have to, you know, shake hands with advertisers.  Yep.  And go up on stage and something and say something.  And riff.  And riff.  We got to riff about. 
[03:54:30]  They're like, you know, open it.  They could just riff for two to four minutes.  And then they.  They want you to just talk about how CBS and technology has kind of joined together to make  this like very interactive kind of thing.  What kind of presumption is it that you could use?  You're supposed to.  Yeah.  Oh, just fucking make it funny.  Riff on it.  That's great.  Not too much pressure.  Have you seen the CBS websites?  They're fantastic.  I had a corporate.  They asked me to do 30 minutes on hair care products.  Oh, great.  They're like, can you just come in and do like 30 on hair? 
[03:55:00]  The nerve.  They just done cancer wig jokes.  They think this is easy.  We have pressure every day to try to make this shit sound like something entertaining.  And they're like, yeah.  You know, they'll just go up there and riff.  They're riff.  They're okay.  That's what we pay them for.  And we're in the mindset.  Why don't we, instead of wasting three hours with these salespeople, that would be three  hours.  Maybe we could relax, you know, get some sleep.  Do nothing.  For the next show.  Get out of a relationship. 
[03:55:30]  Like a dynamite of connection with a woman.  We're heading toward the line of the day.  This AshleyMadison.com might be your thing, Duff.  People that want to cheat.  Prostutes?  Oh, that's the one.  There's an actual website for people that want to cheat.  Right.  They don't hide what they're all about whatsoever.  Right.  Married people could get on there and hook up.  Do we know anyone from AshleyMadison.com?  We had a bore on, man.  Oh, my God.  What was it for?  I was here when he called in.  I'm sure his website's great, but he was a bore. 
[03:56:00]  What were we talking about?  We were talking about Ashley Dupree, I guess.  I don't remember.  Spitzer's chick.  Oh, yeah.  And we need like an expert opinion.  Oh, my God.  I want a connection.  That's what I'm saying.  Really?  A swing scene would just be the way to go.  I mean, if you're going to, well, I guess then you would have to have these.  I just take my dick out in the middle of a room.  Well, no, no.  You don't have to do it like that.  There's some teaching.  You've done some of that swinging?  Oh, yeah.  No, I know a little bit about the swing scene.  And they have off-premise places.  Yeah, well, I don't go to those places.  Wait, Drew, you're into it, too?  No, no, no. 
[03:56:30]  I'm just acknowledging Patrice's trist in the whole swinger market.  He's nuts with that shit.  You've got to bring somebody to switch.  I mean, you've got to have something to trade.  You can't just go barging in.  Well, man, because everybody, every fucking guy I know is.  Can I go alone?  No, you can't go alone.  There'd be one fucking chick that spent their life in a closet, just got out, standing there,  and a thousand guys from Seaside Heights jerking off.  You can't just go alone.  No, it's like showing up at a card game with no money.  Just deal me in.  You've got to put some money in now. 
[03:57:00]  I just want a shot at the winnings.  Ann's house is a swing at house right now.  Fuck your wife.  I don't want to trade nothing to go off.  But can't you just get some chick that you don't really know to go with you?  Well, you can if you can convince her.  Well, certainly you can pay her, or you can try and find somebody.  It's probably not hard.  You do some work on the internet.  You could find a like-minded scenario.  You like going to those clubs?  Not my thing, but it beats the average lounge.  After a while, you start going out.  It's like, oh, really?  You have appetizers?  Great.  Are those tapas?  I can't wait to get there.  I'd rather just see somebody banging on a table, even if I'm not involved. 
[03:57:30]  It just seems like a more enjoyable place to spend time.  Make sure Poe doesn't get my truck.  It's got to be left here.  I'm staying in.  You should stay.  We have a big night.  I thought it was 7.30.  No, we got to be there.  5.  5.  We could push 5.30, 5.45.  Fuck, that sucks.  We'll push it until close to 6.  Ann's got to cancel his appointments at the fuck palace.  Cancel all appointments?  No, actually, I didn't want to go to the gym today.  And then, I kind of want to go home.  It's kind of nice to be home.  That's what I have a house for. 
[03:58:00]  Why don't you stop?  I just go in a hotel and fucking, what?  Just stop.  Just do the right thing.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  If we know you're in a hotel, we know you're safe for one night.  So why don't you just get a hotel?  Unarmed.  I hate being unarmed.  No guns.  No guns.  No guns.  Just hold a gun.  It feels creepy when I don't have a gun on me.  Yeah, you feel vulnerable.  Yeah, you feel vulnerable.  He wants to go home because he needs him.  You feel like you're in the sauna at Crunch Fitness on a Friday?  I know.  Just along with a hard eye.  With a cowboy hat on. 
[03:58:30]  Just leering.  Exactly.  Where is everybody?  Picking things up that haven't fallen.  There's justice.  You need things up that haven't fallen.  Where is that change?  Isn't that a great feeling of security just to have a gun?  Beautiful.  Just that you know, like, I've got a fighting chance.  You got a gun?  No, I had a domestic dispute a few years ago.  I'm not sure that I can actually get a gun.  But then they tell you, meh, meh, meh.  Well, no, no, but there's been a lot of time that's passed.  Wait, you had a break-in? 
[03:59:00]  No, no, no.  I never used a dispute.  No, you have a lot.  You had a break-in.  No, no.  I don't know.  It could have been an inside job.  It's hard to get a pistolized in Manhattan.  And now that's California, it's much easier.  So I'm going to go apply for one.  I had one when I was in Jersey when I was a kid.  But ever since Manhattan, it's such a pain.  You got to jump through hoops in this town to get a pistolized.  It's because they wear you down.  They want you to go, ah, fuck it.  Fuck it.  You got to hire an attorney.  It's your right to fucking bear arms.  But then they may put on so many regulations on you.  Which gives the criminals the advantage, right? 
[03:59:30]  That's right, because they're willing to wait in line.  I like it.  I use this to accessorize now.  I really don't understand the argument for that kind of gun control.  Like, why?  Black.  I mean, obviously you can get a gun.  Oh, is that what it is?  Port-a-wing.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  I'm just kidding.  What is the argument?  I mean, if you have a gun, I mean, obviously the bad guy's going to get a gun.  We know that.  So what's the argument?  Why shouldn't I have a gun?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  There's no, I've never heard a reasonable argument. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's why we need.  If they can pull the guns from everybody.  I mean, if you're in Japan and they effectively keep it out of the hands of criminals, you know,  you've got an argument.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Yeah, that don't work.  I picked out an assortment and I use them to accessorize sometimes.  Sometimes I feel like, eh, the .380's better for tonight.  I think you'd look beautiful with a pistol on your hip.  That's kind of where I go like, this one, my clothes are baggy enough for the .45.  Do you have a carriage permit?  For the .45, yeah.  Fucking A. 
[04:00:30]  So it's like, ooh, that's, you know.  I'm playing here.  That's nice.  I'm playing.  No, you don't.  No.  Are you kidding?  No, but it's like, all right, the baggy clothes are good.  So now I've gotten into this 5'11 tactical gear.  Oh, that's tremendous.  And this isn't one.  Tremendous.  The shirt has a piece of Velcro right here and goes.  That's beautiful.  And it's a holster in your shirt.  And you close it up and you're there.  You got a Walter PPK is right there.  Sure.  Ready for action.  And as a trendsetter.  I very much envy that.  Isn't that great shit?  It's wonderful.  Someone attacks you on the way to get candy out of a dish in the hallway. 
[04:01:00]  Shoot them, you fucking loom.  They laugh at me because I wear a holster gun in my house.  We don't laugh at you.  We worry about shit.  I wear a gun in the house.  He's like, what am I going to do?  If someone barges into the fucking window, I'm going to say, can I go upstairs and get  my gun?  They'll usually say yes.  Oh, okay.  I'm assuming they would say no every time and just start shooting at me.  If anybody cares right now.  The gun on the hip in the house is a little excessive.  Even your saying.  I think they have a reasonable point.  But it's comfy.  I love a carrier's permit.  It's a little wallet. 
[04:01:30]  And it looks good.  I have to shit so badly right now my head hurts.  Oh, wow.  Did you just take a chance?  I think Jimmy took a chance with a fart.  Oh, you just farted and it's warm?  Oh, this is going to be a bad one.  All right.  Line of the day is brought to you by AshleyMadison.com.  If you're looking to cheat or looking for a little something on the side, don't want to  get caught, do yourself a favor.  Check out AshleyMadison.com.  Times are tough.  Times are tough.  My God. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, shit.  Jimmy, Jesus.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Go, Danny.  Jimmy's heard enough.  I'm just listening to this.  Jimmy's had it.  This last weekend alive behavior.  You don't have a brain tumor?  Cut the shit.  That was on regular radio today.  Good job, Jimmy.  Daddy slipped.  No, you were pissed off.  What happened?  Oh, I thought you were punching walls.  Jimmy fucking laid out a bad one.  Duff's had it. 
[04:02:30]  Don't punch my farts.  That's my feelings.  We have Duff David Off in studio.  A lot of people are asking how you spell your last name because they want to get the CD.  Just like the cigar, the luggage, the, you know.  D-O-V, the first name.  Yeah, David Off, D-A-V-I-D-O-F-F-F.  And then David Off, right.  Wait, that's a luggage phonetic is the name of the CD.  Luggage.  You ever been in a duty-free shop, for Christ's sake?  You ever leave the country?  I guess I have, but I don't buy it.  No, David Off, cigars.  You never see the cigars?  No.  And I don't, I was, I thought your name was Duff's camp tonight.  No.  Right.  Exactly. 
[04:03:00]  Duff, Tumia.  Louis Vuitton.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I was going to say, it's Sanka de Mayo, where I drink decaf all my time.  That's a good one, too.  Sanka de Mayo.  All right.  Sanka de Mayo.  This guy's call was Stinko de Mayo.  Very good.  Our awful jokes.  Yes.  Another runner-up line of the day.  I don't understand, why is everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo by hanging outside Home Depot today?  I don't know what I mean.  It's really weird. 
[04:03:30]  All right.  That's a good line.  Sorry.  How many more we got?  Three more?  Another runner-up line of the day.  Kind of like Bandito's walking around there.  Why a car accident?  By the way, all these fun facts go for anything above 96th Street as well.  That's a good line.  That was very good.  A little mean spirit off.  A little mean spirit off.  What he's hurt today.  Coming from the guy who lost a piece of his insides laughing at a woman that had been mugged.  She wasn't mugged. 
[04:04:00]  She's a benefactor.  She's being taught some manners.  She was a benefactor of a man with an erudite perspective.  She was donating a hat to the floor.  She was a benefactor of a...  She was donating a little blood to the old knuckle factory.  Animal.  The great Drew Boogie on MySpace.  Thanks for stopping by today, Drew, with the latest remix.  Sure.  Another runner-up line of the day.  He goes, dude, you got to live your life.  It makes you a better stand-up, dude.  What's he looking for in Guatemala? 
[04:04:30]  A miracle?  A miracle?  Hopefully, Bobby Kelly will be in tomorrow to talk about Guatemala.  I don't know.  We haven't heard from him yet.  Can I mention one thing?  Yeah.  People have been asking me to get tickets for this HBO taping May 21, 22.  Oh, boy.  Jim Norton's show at BroadwayVideo.com free tickets.  Nice.  You get a pair.  Jimmy's hosting an HBO show.  That's huge.  Yeah, we'll see how it goes.  Uh, line of the day time.  One more runner-up.  One more runner-up. 
[04:05:00]  Can the announcer explain why the horse was short, shot like 40 times with pauses, and  why it fell after it had already fallen?  Because they, uh, gave the honor of shooting the horse to New York's new governor.  Very good.  That was a fucking good one.  That was a doozy.  Anybody, uh, have anything else?  No?  No, just a call-in for a lot.  Don't have fun in Indiana.  Oh, thank you very much.  Anything else you want to promote?  No, uh, it wouldn't be soon. 
[04:05:30]  The date wouldn't make any sense.  Uh, no, I'm going to Afghanistan.  What about a website or something?  Yeah, DoVLive.com.  DoVLive.com?  DoVLive.com is my website.  Uh, and I, again, I appreciate you guys having me in.  Thank you.  That was a very funny comment.  Your CV is called, uh, the point is, um, and, uh, you can probably get it anywhere  because Comedy Central put it out.  Yeah, you can get it anywhere.  You're not on the East Coast often, huh?  No, I'm not fucking out there.  The opportunity cost for me of being here is a little high.  Well, next time you're on the East Coast, just stop by and say hi.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  All right.  It's DoV, everyone. 
[04:06:00]  We're going to do the quick out today.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  She just blew up our spot.  All night, 40 years.  We're having fun now.  You friggin' fuddy-duddy.  Make a pie, brud.  No, our duties do-do-do-do-do-all. 
[04:06:30]  Our duties do-do-do-do-do.  Our duties do-do-do-do-do-do have destructive power.  If you think it stinks now, you should have seen it a month ago.  The verein d'Anthony Show. </pre>
